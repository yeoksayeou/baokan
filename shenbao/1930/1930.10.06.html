<p>我們的貢</p>
<p>主婦的責任　（仰）</p>
<p>勸先生們提倡國貨，先生們都明白了，都首肯了，可是國貨的用與不用，一大半的權柄，還是在太太奶奶手裏。你想一家所需的衣食，誰作主張？誰去採辦？據我個人的經騐，十之八九，在主婦手裏。所以提倡國貨，與其說男女共同的責任，不如說女子獨負的責任，今日小姐做衣裳，明天阿官裁校服，此外買一頂帽子，辦幾雙襪子，乃至日用的火柴·肥皂·面盆·手帕·牙刷·雪花·香水·調味品等，無論是否假手於傭僕，可是總逃不了主婦權力之外。做主婦的，是要樣樣顧問，色色見到，只要你不忘記一國貨兩個字，到處可以看得出你是否樂用國貨？到處可以表見你愛用國貨的熱心。在你是不過多費些功夫，多經些麻煩，可是因你這樣一來，可以把許多久候門外的失業工人，統通有工可做，有飯可吃，足以維持地方的安寗，保全社會公衆的秩序。一念之頃，造福無量。我想國内不乏愛國急公的主婦，一定可以采納這個主張的</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>南美革命潮流與經濟之關係</h3>
<p>我屢言之。於今世界各國因商業之衰落。而致經濟之困難。因經濟之困難而國中之反對黨籍以攻擊攻府。迨至政府已倒。而代以執政之敵黨。依然不能挽救此國家經濟之困難。世界商業之衰落。則政局依然不能安定。而各國之推翻政府者。將周而復始。終無寗日。不觀乎南美各加之最近革命潮流乎。玻璃維亞之後。繼之以秘魯。秘魯之後。繼之以阿眞廷。說者謂阿眞廷之革命。爲經濟故而非爲政治故。實則玻秘二國亦未嘗不如是也。</p>
<p>南美各國之區域小。其經濟力薄弱。故一經困難。其發動也易。其外歐美亞之列强。其政府中今日所困慮者亦未嘗不如此國中今日所齮　者亦未嘗不以此。他日因此而生政潮者亦未嘗不若此。美國之厲行減政。日本之難成預算德國之躊躇財政。皆所謂先兆其機。假使世界商業之衰落而無轉機則各國之政潮决難幸免。世界工商業而不變更方法。則世界商業之衰落决無轉機我敢斷言也</p>

<h3>德國選舉結果有其反響</h3>
<p>法西斯黨之突起</p>
<p>中央各黨之蹉跎</p>
<p>未來政局之難關</p>
<p>議會政治之破産</p>
<p>最近國際事情、影響於全世界最大者、無過於德國總選舉、蓋以此次德國國會改選、不僅改變德國之政局、且足吏歐陸外交乃至全世界局勢發生變化故也、近時全世界經濟入於恐慌之時期、各資本主義國家、無不感生産過剩·失業增加之困難、而以德國爲尤甚、德自歐戰後、休養生息、雖已逐漸回復其戰前之地位、但一方面因工業生産、缺乏銷路、他方面因賠欵戰債擔負過鉅、故經濟財政、陷入重重之難關、失業工人、多至五百萬、商家破産、月達千餘件、人民生活成爲重大之問題、而國庫預算、又復羅掘俱空、入不敷出、在此經濟的危機之下、政局乃日益阢隉、白魯寗之中央各黨聯立内閣、因財政案不能在國會通過、乃解散國會、舉行改選、以期獲得人民之擁護、兩月以來、各政黨從事選舉競爭、演說奔走、不遺餘力、果也選舉結果、國會中各政黨之席次、有重要變化、而此變化對於德國内政外交上之影響、則决不能等閑視之、</p>
<p>德國政黨向來分成無數派别、非如英美之僅有政府黨與反對黨、此次德國選舉中參加之政黨凡三十餘、其中屬於右側者、則爲社會國民黨（即法西斯黨）、德意志國民黨、屬於左側者、則爲共産黨與社會民主黨、介於中間者、則爲中央黨（即天主敎黨）、人民黨、人民保守黨、國家黨（即前民主黨改組而成）、經濟黨、巴威略人民黨、均田黨、基督敎社會黨·及其他小黨、白魯寗之聯合政府、乃由代表資産階級之中央各小黨聯合而成、此諸小黨合併之席數、雖勉强可超過半數、但因國會中佔席數最多之社會民主黨、未加入聯合内閣、且右側之國民黨、勢力極爲堅强、故政府不得不解散國會、重行選舉、九月十四日全德舉行國會選舉、投票總數、幾達三千五百萬、佔選民總數百分之八十、較上届選舉多五百萬票、可見德人對於此次選舉之注意、德國選舉採用絕對的比例代表制、每六萬選舉人選出議員一人、因此上届國會僅有議員四百九十二人、新國會中則增至五百七十三人、至各黨所得席數及與上届加會比較、依記者寄稿時的得數字、分配如下、</p>
<p>當選席數　上届國會席數社會國民黨　　　　一○七　　　一二</p>
<p>德意志國民黨　　　　四一　　　七八</p>
<p>人民保守黨　　　　　　二</p>
<p>漢諾威黨　　　　　　　五</p>
<p>人民黨　　　　　　　二六　　　四五</p>
<p>經濟黨　　　　　　　二三　　　二三</p>
<p>中央黨　　　　　　　六九　　　六二</p>
<p>巴威略人民黨　　　　一八　　　一六</p>
<p>均田黨　　　　　　　一八　　　一三</p>
<p>德意志農民黨　　　　　六　　　　八</p>
<p>國家黨（前民主黨）　二二　　　二五</p>
<p>基督敎社會黨　　　　一四</p>
<p>農業同盟　　　　　　　三　　　　三</p>
<p>社會民主黨　　　　　一四三　　一五三</p>
<p>共産黨　　　　　　　　七六　　　五四</p>
<p>就上列結果、可知此次選舉、得最大勝利者、爲極右側之社會國民黨、與極左側之共産黨、社會民主黨、雖仍佔新國會之最多席次、但其勢力、已漸見削减、此外中間諸黨、除中央黨尚能保其原有勢力外、皆遭極大之挫折、其結果與政府所期望者、適相反對、故以此次選舉爲政府之最大失敗、實定論也、</p>
<p>此次選舉中最爲趾高氣揚者、則爲社會國民黨、即法西斯黨、此黨之領袖、爲一未入德籍之奥國工人希德氏、主張推翻民主共和制、實行意大利之一黨專政、對外取銷凡爾賽條約、恢復德國東境被割領土、要求海外殖民地、擴張德國陸軍、實行德奥合併、要之不外公然宣布德國之復仇而巳、對内則抄襲社會黨的政綱、主張取銷不勞而穫之財産、没收戰爭而致富者之産業、並解决失業問題、此黨雖爲最反動的政黨、其黨綱類多操切而不易實施、但因近年德人貧困不安、附和者甚衆、此黨復師法慕沙里尼組織武裝之黨員軍隊、到處騷動、此次選舉中竟獲得八百五十餘選民之投票、自十二席之小黨、一躍而爲一百零七席之大黨、除社會民主黨以外、新國會中勢力無出其右者、與此黨立於相反地位之共産黨亦然、共産黨於此次選舉中、覘民意之向背、改變向來所用之策略、於階級鬭爭、無産者專政等口號暫置不題、而竭力宣傳廢棄和約取銷賠欵、藉以博一般民族主義者之歡心、結果此黨席數、乃得增至半數、成爲國會中之第三大黨、此極左極右兩黨之同時獲得勝利、表示德國資産階級及無産階級、均不滿於目前改制、主張推翻現局、破棄條約、恢復大戰之損失、實顯而易見、吾人皆知德國之反動派及共産黨、均主聯意聯俄、以重興復仇戰爭、此種心理、普遍全德、則行見法國大陸政策、將受重大打擊、白里安（法外長）柴吾斯基（波蘭外長）從此恐將不能安枕、日内瓦之外交家、雖正高據講壇、唱歐陸聯邦之空論、然歐洲戰雲、則日復緊張、德國選舉結果、實其朕兆也、</p>
<p>至就内政方面而論、此次選舉結果、白魯寗内閣、必隨之而倒、此後德國政局之解决、僅有二策、一爲右派聯合内閣、即集合社會國民黨、德意志國民黨、人民保守黨及中央黨等而成、一爲大聯合内閣、即就現内閣之基礎、再加入社會民主黨、而由社會民主黨握其中樞、將來之傾向、將視興登堡總統之意旨而定、蓋興登堡總統在德國政治中、實佔扼要之地位、苟下月七日新國會召集時、興登堡命社會民主黨組織混合内閣、則内政外交、一時當無重大之更張、但代表資産階級之中央各黨、與社會民主黨政見適相背馳、尤其社會黨首領勃郎（即現普魯土國務總理）與興登堡總統勢不兩立、故此種聯合内閣之能否成爲事實、實一大疑問、至右派聯合内閣、倘一旦成立、則德國外交政策、必起一大變化、歐洲國際局勢、將益紛糾、然社會國民黨對於組閣問題、要求條件極爲苟刻、溫和派各黨、未必能與之合作、故目前政局、無論向左向右、皆無解决之善策、多黨制之國家、左右兩絕對黨獲得大勝利後、政府之組織、必發生問題、此新國會召集後、不久或重行解散、甚或突起政變、推翻憲法、實行狄克推多、在目前俶擾不安之德國、亦非不可能之事、德自民主革命、採用共和制、十二年於茲、然國内政潮無時或息、此次選舉結果、政局更入於從來未有之迷陣中、以德國民族之優秀而長於組織、民主制之試騐、尚遭此阻阨、意者者模克拉西之不適於時代潮流乎、吾願醉心於議會政治者其省諸、（化魯）一九三○年九月十六日寄於巴黎、</p>
<h3>德社民黨與政府有合作可能</h3>
<p>國民社四日柏林電　德國會社會民主黨已發表决議、内容極空泛圓滑、故政府黨報紙視爲對於内閣至少可以表示善意中立、反對黨報紙則信其仍留其反對内閣財政改革方案之餘地、至國家社會黨國會領袖戈培爾斯、於晤見白魯寗總理前、曾在此間演說、已閉絕該黨與現執政協調之路、因此外間多料白魯寗内閣、將决意設法與社會民主黨合作、</p>

<h3>財部甘末爾設計委員會稅收政策意見書（三續）</h3>
<p>消費稅制度之計劃、當先明瞭關稅與内地稅或拒絕之稅相互關係、對於輸入關稅不能增加過高、使資本勞動自當然獲利之工業、流向因物品外貨、提高國貨價格、而强使獲利之工業、且其結果亦將使國家財政蒙不利之影響、一方面輸入關稅之收入必大减少、他方面則藉人力提高某種貨價、致令資本勞動脫離其素來從事之某種工業、因而此種工業之生産力及納稅能力、亦大减少、故對於輸入貨物課以輸入稅時、則對於種類相同之國産應課以相當數額之消費稅、反言之、對於國産貨物課以消費稅時、則對於同類之外貨不可不課以相當輸入稅、否則外貨充盈、不免喧賓奪主、使國家財政大受損害、此所以本委員會建議火柴稅及水泥稅、不特對國内産物適用即對於外貨亦適用之、</p>
<p>中國徵收之各種消費稅、其最著者爲烟酒稅、對於雪茄及香烟所課之稅、與本委員會關於物品稅之意見、並無重大之出人、此項意見、已於前述二草案中加以說明、其他各種烟草稅、似宜詳細斟酌、加以改正、本委員關於此點雖未有詳細之建議、然就事理言之、則所有各項烟酒稅以歸併成一種賦稅爲妥關於營業執照費、本宜歸入一般營業執照或營業稅之一部、但事實上此項賦稅旣劃歸各省辦理、則應如何解决之處、尚需有更周密之考慮、</p>
<p>酒稅對於外貨及國貨一律徵收、對於輸入酒稅當依一定稅率、而以海關爲徵收機關其稅率可較現在流行者稍高、凡本國所産之洋酒、則依其品質之優劣課以相當之稅、此項賦稅與土酒稅均應視爲内地稅、</p>
<p>以烟酒事務局歸併於捲烟統稅處、則於烟酒稅行政之效能必能改良並可節省行政費用此則無庸懷疑者也、</p>
<p>行政組織　關於内稅行政、本委員會會於其他理由書内加以討論、於此應重加串述者、即關於鹽稅以外之一切内地稅、其稅收行政、應合併於一處或一局管轄之、</p>
<p>鹽稅爲中國收入中最古之財源、但因近年政局不靖、致其行政上發生之問題與其他賦稅之行政不同、故前述關於内地稅合併於一棧關之計畫、似應將鹽務稽核總所作爲例外、但無論如何、本委員會於一九二九年九月六日所提出之火柴特别消費稅法草案理由書、力主設立統一機關、稱之爲局或處或所、（采用何種名稱當無關係）直接隸屬於財政部長、掌理其他一切新舊内稅之行政、括有左例各項、捲烟統稅、烟酒稅、印花稅、特别消費稅包括本委員會建議之火柴稅及水泥稅在内、</p>
<p>中央政府各部各機關各自徵稅之制度、亦爲應加研究之問題、目前財政部以外之各機關、多藉檢查費用或其他名目、而自由徵稅雖官廳就其所盡職務徵收公費、不得認爲失當然稅收行政、若非由同一機關處理、終不免有混亂及重複之弊、</p>
<p>本委員會曾於其他草案内建議、將賦稅之行政與徵收别爲二事、由二機關分任、並嚴格監督稅欵之徵收、而將稅欵全部以國庫名義存貯之、如能實行此種方法、則前此由徵收機關截留稅欵一部充當徵收費用祇以剩餘部分解交國庫之制度、自可廢除、所有徵收費用、悉由中央政府監督、而由國庫直接支付且此種方法采用以後、所有包捐制度、亦無從存在蓋此種制度、祗能存在於不適當之政府組織也、上述二種制度之剷除、其爲必要、毫無義、</p>
<p>最後尚有一重要問題、亟待解决、即中央政府與地方政府收入財源之劃分是也、中央稅收與地方稅收劃分標準之建議（業依全國經濟會議之建議修正）對此問題之解决、似尚完滿、但此問題之解决、應先修正現行之稅收法規、並應改組中央與地方政府關於稅收之行政範圍、使各就其合法範圍内、處理其財源、此問題當然與政治有關、總之、稅收行政範圍之劃分、實爲有效稅收行政之前提、而徵稅所得之欵項、在理應由中央政府逐級撥付於地方政府、而不應由地方政府撥付於中央政府、非然者、中央政府之生存、將惟地方政府是賴矣、（完）</p>

<h3>市童軍理事會選舉會</h3>
<p>｜選出理事八人　｜定期宣誓就職</p>
<p>是國童子軍上海市理事會　昨由市黨部訓練部召開選舉會於市黨部、到服務員甚多、並市執委會代表中國童子軍司令部代表等百餘人、由市訓練部長童行白主席、開會如儀、各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>主席致詞　諸位、今天選舉本市童子軍與事、所到的人數、總共有四十六位、總計合格的服務員有九十四位、除了請假的有五位外、尚有八十五位、今天到的人數有了四十六位、已經超過半數、可以正式開會我們知道、童子軍事業一方面是國家的、一方面是社會的因爲童子軍是國家的最優秀的靑年國民、同時改良社會的墓本份子、所以童子軍事業、比一般的國家事業與社與事業、都要重要、因此對於童子軍的訓育方面、便須格外的注重、在軍閥政府時代、童子軍事業都靠發個人的熱心努力勉强維持、政府方面、毫不顧問、所以童子軍的種種表現都非常散漫、現在本黨執政　一切設施、均以三民主義爲敎育原則、對、童子軍亦然、務使童子軍敎育、不背於黨治下的敎育政策、務使童子軍事業、成爲眞正的國家與社會的敎育中心、上海是全國最重要區域、無能什麽團體、都要有個中心組織才好、童子軍也一樣、假使没有一個中心組織則無異無靈魂的驅體、要想前途的發展那、眞是夢想、所以理事會的成立、無異於爲上海意子軍事業創造了新的生命、現在上海理事會在黨與政府的熱烈的希望之下、在本市童子軍的懇切的要求之中得告成了、我相信、這個新生命所繫的團體産生之後、一切的設施、一切的計劃、都可順序漸進、凡向前發展、上海童子軍事業從此前途光明無量、希望今後本市團員、能格外團結一致、犧牲私見、以求親愛精誠的具體表現、最後還有要希望將來的理事會的、（一）整飭紀律問題、吾人知道紀律是團體的命脈、没有紀律、這個團體应要渙散、童子軍是員有强種强國、改造社會的重責的、那對於紀律當更加嚴謹的遵守、（二）要充分發展童子軍的精神、所謂童軍的精神並不是在於式樣的美觀服裝的神氣、乃在處處的工作上面、能夠始終一的表現童子軍的精神、并且隨時隨處要發揚大公無私的美德、以爲社會楷模、以爲靑年表率、這幾點深望能心體而力行云、</p>
<p>籌備經過　朱家讓同地報告理事會籌備的經過云、上海童子軍、在過去幾年、因没有敎育的指導原則、所以非常的散漫、本黨執政以來對於舊時的不良的地方、都大加革新、對童子、軍亦然、因此童子軍事業在本黨的領導之下日在改進的變動中、因此上海原有的童子軍的指導機關如促進會等、亦不能不有所變更、中央對於童子軍事業曾經有了不少的計劃、和新設施、在市黨部方面、也秉承了中央的意旨、有過相當的勢力、今天理事會的成立就是我們勢力的結果、市黨部辦理市理事會的籌備以來、已有三個月、當中因爲司令部尚没有雖完一個統一的指導機關、例如有師部組織的擬議後、又改稱理事會、同時各項條例都未頒布、所以在署假期中、曾經一度的停頓、因之遲遲至今、不得成立本市理事會、成立理事會所最感困離的第一個是經費的問題、假使没有經費辦事就要感到棘手、市敎育局長是當然理由、我們向他接洽每月津貼二百元的要求、總算很同滿的解决、這個難題、算已打破、第二是會所問題、我們所要求的會所的條件、一要地方好、二要不出錢、三要交通便、這樣就非常困難、起初想附設在市商會、後因市商會時附設機關太多、改爲一區黨部不過一區黨部交通稻　不便、但在我不到相當的地方的時候、總算聊勝於無了</p>
<p>代表致詞　中國童子軍司令部代表致詞云、主席朱同志已經報告得詳細、兄弟不過來述幾句中央對於上海理事會的幾點重大的希望　上海市訓練部苦心孤詣的籌整理事會的成立、我們應該怎樣的努力、怎樣的想、到上海童子軍前途　才不負一番苦心、中國童子軍的組織、分四個階級就是國和市縣理事會及省理事會、中央司令部、因爲理事會的没有成立、使中央與團之間、發生許多的隔膜、這因爲空間的詎離太遠、以此情形不明瞭的緣故、有了理事會的組織、則對司令部有所帮助對團自然也有許多便當、所以理事會的成立、是非常重要的、理事會成立之後、對於童子軍的組織、考核諸方面、也有不少的便利處、怎樣呢、因爲中央對團、時常照顧不到團長的才幹、往往有不及之處、有了理事會的組織這種難題　就可迎刃而解了、希望上海理事會成立之後、計於以上種種、要盡力做去、</p>
<p>選舉結果　當選者沈愚·瞿越·汪剛·黄仙·張訓芳、（以上正式理事）顧梅來·趙慰祖·王文華、（以上候補理事）以上新理事、聞將於今日由監選員會同市訓練部陳報司令部核准、宣誓就職日期、約在雙十節云、</p>

<h3>草地綱球單打甲紀</h3>
<p>俵氏奪去錦標</p>
<p>｜邱飛海不幸以三比一失敗｜</p>
<p>球　藝　甚　佳一九二五年日本全國單打錦標俵氏以三比一之結果、戰勝我國邱飛海、獲得上海草地綱球單打錦標、俵氏前日已以二比一領先、嗣因天暗中止、昨日下午二人仍在法商總會繼續比賽、俵氏又以六比四勝第四盤、大功告成、本届單打證錦標、歸其所有、賽畢、草地網球會會長惠特、致詞並請頓納夫人給奬而散、</p>
<h3>邱飛海生氣勃然</h3>
<p>鳴鐘三下、大戰開幕、邱飛海生氣勃然、力圖進展、頻向對方反手射去、頗占優勢、又以聲東擊西之法、累次得分、獲得第四盤之第一局、第二局二人均見精彩、一分之得必經若干時之苦戰、無量數之奮鬥、其艱難可知、邱在此局中、大有作爲出手敏捷、攻擊得法、卒以十比八勝是局、第三局、俵氏心頭火起、觸網野球時有發見、邱飛海從容不迫、又勝第三局　斯時聲勢之盛、不難戰勝第四盤、與俵氏一决最後之　雄矣、</p>
<h3>俵氏苦戰奪錦標</h3>
<p>然而俵氏久歷沙場經騐宏富、當此阨勢之下、猶能謹愼從事　難能可貴、渠利用邱氏供球之弱突然加以抽擊、致邱氏回顧不及、因是而奪回二局、再以本人發球占勢、又勝轉二局、二十分鐘時聞、極盡滄桑之變、蓋俵氏已一躍居先、得四與三之比數、而成反敗爲勝之趨勢矣、邱氏奮然加鞭、左抽右擊、亦爭回一局、打成四四平數、最後二局、幸福之神、棄邱而就俵氏、故不久俵氏連獲勝利、而以六比四勝第四盤、</p>
<p>俵氏（七……五七……五六……八六……四）邱飛海</p>
<h3>上海草地網球會單打錦標</h3>
<p>甲組……俵氏（王開攝）</p>

<p>第二盤　首局劉聲勢洶洶、抽壓得神、竟以四比一告勝然時乎不再郭乃一帆風順連克六局、復成六與一之比、</p>
<p>第三盤　是盤郭仍以六比一勝、惟第六局極被劉大加打擊、吃個滑四、劉於該局中表演竟佳、綜計三盤比賽、郭啟達打成一色、均爲六一之比、妙極巧極、</p>
<p>（二）女子組……楊仁勝楊璧珍</p>
<p>｜二比○｜</p>
<p>兩女士於上次初賽時、均因對方葉權、决賽資格不勞獲、便宜了她們、昨日决賽以定錦標之誰屬、論雙方賽力均頗雄厚、惟楊仁女士之發球校佳、又肯努力奔救、壁珍女士則不然、敵方來球略難、即瞠目束手、不肯輕移蓮步、其失敗之因、多在此、惟有時楊仁女士過失一些、每多自殺者、結果楊仁女士以二比○奪得錦標、</p>
<p>第一盤此盤共戰十局楊仁勝第一·二·四·五·六·十·共六局、壁珍女士勝第三·七·八·九共四局、成六比四楊仁勝、</p>

<h3>一得之言</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>人生和打牌一般。豎起好牌。猶如生在富貴之家。豎起壞牌。猶如貧賤子弟。要是赤手成家。譬如費盡心力。也許和出一副大牌。可是萬難之事。又如自己也還能打牌上家又能給你喫張。這譬如有人提挈。所以也不至於輸錢。要是自己牌風正壞。上家又拚命來釘你。這是落井下石像極了。它如暴發之户。不正當發財的富人。這極像活手的和出大牌一般。</p>
<p>人身和天地一樣。天欲其清輕。地欲其重濁。人們不知攝生之道。思慮傷其腦。色慾戕其腎。頭部不清輕而重濁。腹部不重濁而清輕。上重下輕。重心失位。於是頭痛·腦暈·目眩·耳鳴·氣喘·腎虧·夢遺等病遂生。所以技擊家之擺馬步。靜坐家之丹田呼吸。都是注意上清輕。下重濁之道。</p>
<p>人生徹底。樣是空。惜看不破。想不透的多。何苦胸襟褊狹。意氣驕矜。虚榮勢利。來築海底籬笆。在我看來。讀書最樂。爲善最樂。</p>
<p>人到中年。歡情渺然。誠如王鈍根所說。「縱令今日打萬元底之牌。而大勝特勝。萬不及髫齡時與先大父打制錢麻雀之樂也。」唉。年光不能倒流。功業不立於斯世。那得不踐東阿所歎。</p>

<p>比前外相兼第二國際主席樊迪文氏。此次應中央研究院之聘來華演講。先往北平瀋陽。然後漫游京杭。以時間匆促。留滬不過兩三日。本埠交通大學以樊氏爲總理故友。且於中國政情極爲明瞭。特設法邀請來校蒙氏慨允。於一日下午在該校文治堂演講。聽者不下千人。來賓有中央研究院長蔡孑民氏及西人多名。茲雜記花絮。以寄本談。</p>
<p>樊氏之形態　四時。樊氏偕諸要人入座。氏年事已近六旬。蓄鬚甚多。目架鼻鏡。狀貎奇偉。精神尤覺　鑠。首由鐵道部次長兼校長黎照寰致歡迎詞。略謂中比兩國。關係極深。樊氏倡民族自决與世界和平。尤爲中國人民所切望云云。隨用英語自譯一過。</p>
<p>全操法語　繼由樊氏演講。初猶以爲係用英語。乃自始至終。全操法語。會塲聽衆。鮮精此道。故惟就其姿態而揣測其用意而已。立氏側者。爲其專任翻譯。樊氏語雖不可解。然其聲調姿態。誠不媿爲一偉大演說家。激昻處聲如洪鐘。震動屋宇。以古稀之年。而精神壯健如是。信非易事矣。</p>
<p>服膺三民主義　樊氏每演講一段。即由舌人譯述。初對總理之民族·民權·民生主義。發表意見。表示欽敬服膺。而適合現代需要。樊氏理解詳確於三民主義有深切之認識者。殊匪易易譯者口才極佳。歷數小時。使聽者了無倦容。</p>
<p>語妙天下　氏對共産主義。頗多抨擊。謂若輩但以暴力刦持天下。不問各地之情狀若何。譬如女子有孕。應及其成熟生産。子女方能健全、今乃不計及此。於五六個月時。即以人工强其産生。其結果安能完善。世界未達共産時期。偏欲强之赤化殆亦猶是爾。一時聞者。爲之鬨堂。</p>
<p>突來質問　樊氏演說畢。忽羣衆中一人起立。質問三點。謂比利時迄今未放棄治外法權。英國工黨政策未合第二國際理論。比人在華設居留地等。滔滔陳詞。聽衆爲之愕然。當時主席以所詢尚屬有理乃囑譯者轉詢樊氏。樊氏因將昔日在議會應付質問之態度。從容辯覆。歷時幾達半句鐘。遂於歡呼聲中散會。</p>
<h3>機關槍治太别紀</h3>
<p>— 良民</p>
<p>機關槍爲誰。人盡知爲吾蘇寶山袁希洛俶畬先生别號也。先生行三。長兄觀瀾。以德行重於時。邇緣微疾。捐館滬上。哲人云萎。海内傷之。俶畬先生。夙以剛直敢言。畏憚當時。故人爭號曰機關槍。不知者。初震其名。必以爲鋒利難近。然及獲晋接。則又藹然可親。先生殆内頡頏而外恂恂者。先生隸國民黨也久。舊爲同盟會員。議論動天下。稱革命健者。以性恬退。一樂從縱横捭闔者流。逞雄一時。鼎革後。獨致力於敎育。歷長南菁蘇中同濟附中各校校長。先後凡十餘年。公門桃李。遍江南北。十八年春。自啓東移官太倉。清風亮節。太之人耳目一新。牛刀小試。凡十有四月去官。治績炳然。載在口碑。先生重性情。在任之日。每當紀念集會。常有極沉痛之演說。手舞足蹈。熱情奔躍。聞者興起。自云生平最所痛恨者。厥爲烟毒之流佈。下車之日。即告人曰。袁某在太一日。必盡力肅清乃已。及後奉令開辦調騐。受理檢舉。雷厲風行。不避嫌怨。雖以此見惡於一二豪紳。不顧也。有政警某。先以吸烟被革。警固虎而冠者。旣遭斥。復居家販土爲業。公門胥役。連結一氣。侈然自大。先生偵知之。因出巡之便。遽往捕之。卒置於法。由是猾吏歛迹。又嘗拘辦訟棍徐某。一邑稱快。初。徐有近戚某。爲邑搢紳。于先生有舊。及徐被逮。有見於先生者。問先生曰。紳苟來求缓頰。則先生將奈何。先生曰。亦有從法以辦耳。蓋公私不可不分。紳明者。安不辨此。即來吾亦不能從也。紳聞而竟不進一言。然先生卒由是見罪於紳焉。先生居官儉約。出必步行。未嘗命車。尤重視農作。凡遇蝗災螟害。輒親往鄉間。巡行陌隴間。指示鄉民防遇捕捉諸法。聚語如家人父子。復時時集鄉人作淺近之演說。懇切沉摯。人皆詫爲歷齒數十年。未見此官。其行事類如此。性閑逸。耽花木。署故有園圃。荒棄殆盡。自先生至。剪拂編栽。秩然整然。暇則吟嘯其間以爲樂。善書法。求者踵相接。未嘗却之。迨後以地方經費。諸多掣肘。屢謁上峯。條陳擘劃。冀有所施展。卒不蒙採擇。先生雅不欲素餐尸位。遂毅然辭官歸。而賦詩見志云。「慙愧經年政績無。爲人求牧困於芻。守廉羣笑痴猶甚。禦寇兵能有已夫。差幸蝗蝯不再見。疚心橋路未完敷。掛冠今日賦歸去。不及淵明有故廬。」可以見先生矣。行之日。道旁觀者。如堵而立。羣太息以爲賢令焉。（却酬）</p>
<h3>程艷秋種種</h3>
<p>— 興秋</p>
<p>文姬歸漢。乃艷秋創作。事本蔡文姬歸漢故事。情節雖簡單。而編製規模殊宏麗。是劇文姬歌曲之雅馴。服裝之新穎。别開生面。宫中對酒及祭昭君墓兩塲佈景華麗幽雅各極其致。歸漢時之儀仗全用舊式。純粹仿古。唱工繁重西皮二黄互用。除元板快板南梆子外。尚有慢西皮正二黄反調三大段。唱工之精華。則以胡笳十八拍原調一段二黄最難能可貴。蓋其中唱詞七字八字不等。又每句中有一兮字。瑤卿授艶秋時。按字造腔。每句中之兮字。須不俟胡琴過門即唱訖。與尋常二黄唱法逈異。貞晦詩所謂秋郎啼笑妙女子。萬人傾倒氍毹紅者。非虚語也。</p>
<p>世界學院中法大學於十月二日晚六鐘開會歡迎艶秋。特奏古樂助興。鄭毓秀博士爲遼西水災籌賑主辦化裝跳舞會。定于下星期在大華飯店舉行、聞將持煩艶秋加演歌舞佳劇。蓋艶秋尚俠好義。集欵賑災。不得不有所借重也。</p>
<p>有署名體道者贈艶秋聯云。「玉振金聲齒牙吐慧美而艶。「霜華月朗。肝膽照人清若秋。」上聯言其藝術。下聯言其性情。合作也。</p>
<p>短訊　老伶工李春利。爲海上著名凈角。隸三星舞台。生平好善性成。遇貧苦者求其資助。罔不慷慨解囊。以故梨園中人感樂道之。近以鑒於東北水災之慘狀。惻然爲之心憫。乃自動捐助大洋五十元。以一普通之伶人而能勇於爲善若此。可風也。（昌）</p>

<h3>趙鐵橋先生行述（三）</h3>
<p>— 趙光祖</p>
<p>黨人不得志於川東南。則趨川西。大舉襲成都。先君再至隆昌。成都事又敗。鹿生莘友兩姑丈及張致祥先生等六人下獄。號六君子。程德藩先生走死嘉定。諸走宜賓。屏山者亦死。清川督趙爾豐奏捕餘黨。先君亡歸樹人學校。校長屬兩學生護先君東走忠州。逾年。捕稍懈。回樹人學校畢業。西入成都。探六君子。則分監於成都府獄及成都華陽兩縣獄。先君賂獄吏。得出入爲六君子與黨人密通聞問。廣安事又敗。錦帆先生裏創來。清吏閉城大索。不得出。因先君避入城都縣獄。與莘友姑丈共飲七日。去。黨人屢起屢仆。勢不振。相率去四川。先君以爲黨人有行動。無宣傳。故易敗。創游藝報。借文藝鼓吹革命。鹿生姑丈於獄中主撰。先姡於外發行。而聲名漸露。清大吏微聞江安刼城之胡裕斌爲趙者化名。刊章捕之。</p>
<p>民國紀元前二年。先君爲謀六君子出獄。至北京。則汪精衛黄復生兩先生又以謀刺清攝政王人獄。北京黨人多亡匿。先君至。設機關於延旺廟街。召諸亡匿者。出南下窪。會陶然亭。密計事。自是以爲常。與田梓琴先生創國光新聞。斥清廷失德。隱然爲北中國革命領導</p>
<p>先君以救六君子事。謀之四川京曹。不可。與陳璧君先生謀刧法部獄。　汪黄。又不果。嘗從御史趙公堯生學古文辭。問及黨事。先君未嘗不流涕也。趙公爲請清庭開黨禁。前後三摺俱留中。武漢起兵後二十餘日。清庭開黨禁。汪黄出獄。又二十餘日。成都克復。六君子出獄。</p>
<p>初。先君密赴吳祿貞軍。期以九月十七日據石家莊。斷武漢清軍後路。與濚州張紹曾軍夾攻北京。至期。先君約汪同赴石家莊。于道聞吳死。乃經天津轉灤州。入軍門。問張統制。則先一日張之協統潘矩楹受清廷命。奪張軍而代之矣。先君與汪僞爲清資政院遣來勸張無輕議國政者。而馳還天津。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二八八）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　翠竹涙斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>寗波老人的種種手叚。原意是在　走翠筠。但翠筠到了這種環境之下。也只有兩條路。一條路是死。一條路是走。從前有位名士。早已說過。討了一位姨太太。不安於室。好似捕獲了一隻翠鳥。養在籠中。可是那翠鳥不服樊籠。到頭來也只有兩法子。一是把他關死在籠中。一是開籠放他翺翔而去。現在翠筠就是一隻翠鳥了。倘使不開籠放他出去。無非是死在他家。倒要多賠一副棺木。所以到了後來。章乙靑看伊成了一個藥罐頭了。好在自己另有所眷。不必需要翠筠。把伊留在家裏。無非多一氣塊。寗波老人有時和章乙靑爭鬧起來。就把翠筠作爲口實。萬一翠筠因氣憤之故。尋了什麽短見。又是一塲着水人命。况且寗波老人的意思。就是要趕伊出門。因此章乙靑就取了開籠放鳥主義。就讓翠筠走了。總算是顧念前情。伊的衣服首飾。讓伊取去。另外又給了伊三百塊錢。這一重因緣。便算了結。這便是翠筠重行出山的始末了。左詩晨重遇了翠筠。着實勸了伊一番。流浪在堂子裏。終不是一件事。還是放開慧眼來。看定了一個人。纔是道理。我也知道你此番出山。有不得不出山的苦裏。但是經此一番以後。多少總長了一些見識與經騐了。翠筠歎了一口氣道。呌你一聲好二少。我們堂子裏人。已經製成了一個做人家姨太太的坯子了。若是人家要討正式的大太太。再也不肯走到我們堂子裏來。至於下等社會的人。我們也不肯嫁他。前次我的嫁那位姓章的。雖然是我的年輕没有經騐。可是也不能算不愼重。你想姓章的雖有一個老婆。却是安放在鄉下。不到上海來的。問了他許多朋友。都是如此說。上海地方。有許多做生意的人。像他那樣的人也很多。尤是寗波紹興地方人。却不想他另有一個老人。而且是個朋友的老婆。雖是一個姘頭。刧有這樣的勢力。千不該。萬不該。我是不該搬到他們一宅子去住。倘然住在外面。我想還不至於到如此地步。第二。就是我生性太老實。都當人家是好人。剛進去的時候。我以爲男人有兩三個老婆。是普通的事。大家和和氣氣過日子。也就算了。伊與姓章的有相當的歷史。聽說從前在錢財上又援助他的。現在我就卑屈一點。也不要緊。便是給伊裝裝烟。我也没有什麽不可以。</p>

<h3>樊迪文昨演講世界和平問題</h3>
<p>必民治主義勝專制主義　　世界和平始得永久保障</p>
<p>昨日下午四時、第二國際主席比國前外交部長樊迪文氏、在北河南路上海市商會公開演講、題爲和平問題、偕同樊氏前往者、有蔡元培·王景岐·王曉籟·楊公達·比使華洛斯·等、聽講者以學生居多數、約共數百人、茲節錄樊氏演辭於次、</p>
<p>蔡元培致詞　首由蔡元培致介紹詞、略謂樊迪文先生生於一八六六年、曾在比京大學修法律政治經濟社會諸學、十九歲得法學博士、在比京作律師、加入工黨、不久即使該黨成爲比國最有力之社會黨、一八九四年被選爲下議院議員、從此以社會黨領袖資格、至今未離議席、一九○○年至一九一八年任比京大學敎授、一九一六年至一九一八年間爲民食部長、一九一八年至一九二一年爲司法部長、及國務副主席、一九二五年至一九二七年二十月任外交部長兼國務副主席、樊氏學說、兼採德國馬克思恩格爾、法國聖西門蒲魯東兩派、其經濟觀念以取消資本制度、及私有財産爲對象、以提倡職工組合爲方法、以暫時容許小工商、及小地主存在爲過渡、以公共生産及公共消費爲歸宿、凑政治觀念、以主張普通選舉爲取得政權之途徑、以多立社會法制爲實行改革之先導、一八九六年在倫敦、一九○○年在巴黎、舉行之國際社會黨大會、樊氏已爲該黨最重要領袖之一、會中對如何維持國際和平之問題、至爲緊要、歐戰後、樊氏尤努力於國際和平之恢復、積極維護國際聯盟、參贊國際勞工局、其愛好和平之誠意可見、今日所講者爲和平的組、必有苞關重要之意義、昭示吾人、中國國民黨總理先生於民族主義中說、中國固有之道德、有愛和平一條、而臨終時、尚呼和平奮門救中國、足見吾黨愛好和平之誠意、必有與樊先生之言、可相印證者、我等現願請樊先生賜敎云云、　　凡爾賽條約　旋樊氏於鼓掌聲中起立演說、由楊公達翻譯、略謂、兄弟與捷克斯拉夫外交部長魏爾夫、曾簽訂兩種重要和平條約、一即凡爾賽和約、其一即一九二五年之洛加洛條約也、凡爾賽和會、因歐戰結束後、爲欲解决以後和平問題所開之會議、當時中比兩國因參戰功績、在會中有外交特别利益、即可、在會内說話要求、但承認及議决權、仍操　英法美意日五强、而英法美三國威權尤大、故有三頭會議之稱、開　後、法代表最爲强硬、謂此會應以戰勝者之意見爲依歸、議决條件、提出後不可更改、其後德代表祇得屈服於威力之下、忍痛接受條件、故凡爾賽和會實非眞正同意的和平、乃以武力爲後盾之强迫的和平也、但五年後、復開洛加洛和會、氣象爲之變、英代表張伯倫頗能顧全歐洲各國之利益、德代表雖極强硬、但一方面極爲溫和、法代表白里安亦主人道和平、故會議結果爲同意的保障的和平、而非强迫的和平、與凡爾賽和會絕對不同、</p>
<p>最近無戰爭　自兩種條約先後簽訂以來、歐洲及全世界頗能維持和平、但地方上之局部小戰爭、時有發生、吾儕亦殊不能否認、然幸均不至牽動全世界耳、據兄弟個人之觀察、對於未來是否有戰爭的恐怖和危險之發生、敢言最近期内、决無戰爭、弟在日内瓦曾遇捷克總統、亦詢以此項問題、據云絕不至發生、蓋戰爭之燃燒原料已在歐戰時用盡、來源旣絕、火安由生、此語與兄弟之意完全吻合、倘有一國定欲冒舉世之大不韙、挑起世界戰爭、在理容或可能、但國家之物質經濟上、及人民之心理上、不加允許、勢必至於破産失敗而巳、</p>
<p>和平之保障　至於未來和平之保障、必有一條件、即和平力量是否能戰勝戰爭的力量、否則戰爭殊不能倖免、在今日世界之和平原案、一爲第二國際、主張世界民族全體合作打倒專制侵略維持、保障未來和平、另有一種即國際聯盟是也、國聯對禁酒及其他各種經濟改良社會事業、確盡了相當力量、但眞能維持和平與否、兄弟實深懷疑、蓋國聯之組織、尚有美國及蘇俄二大國未加入、實爲大缺點、而北美合衆國包括民族頗多、隱然又爲一個國聯、蘇俄社會聯邦说可成爲一個國聯、倘將來中國造成一種聯邦式的中國、則以中國之地大物博、亦算一個國聯、最近白里安提出歐洲聯邦計劃、倘能實現、又是一個國聯、兄弟對白氏計劃、原則上極爲贊同、蓋歐洲處目下團體競爭時代、苟對於經濟物質不聯合一致、將來定要失敗破産、但何時實現、僅爲一種夢想而巳、</p>
<p>歐聯邦計劃　欲歐聯計劃之實現、有一種先决條件、即應首將政治組織共同之國家聯合起來、但歐洲今日一種爲民治主義國家、另一種爲專制主義國家、以兩個極端相反之政治組織、是否能聯合一致、故曰實現等於夢想也、倘歐洲各國能仍擁護國際聯盟、在國聯下團結起來、則或可望成功、</p>

<h3>北遊印象</h3>
<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>（十一）旅行吉林</p>
<p>春天終會被南風吹到塞外來了、大地變了毅色、人們的心和萬物都禁不住地在跳躍着、太陽的光也帶着微笑呵、</p>
<p>在這個時候、學畫的學生們是怎樣的高興背了畫具向野外去作畫啊、那像成羣的小鳥飛着尋覓他們的糧食般的、</p>
<p>於是大家都希望着有一次旅行、</p>
<p>在幾次開會的結果、决定旅行到吉林省城、首途的前三個鐘點同學們都行裝理好、本來我是很不想去的、因爲我知道吉林省城是一個不進化的城鎭、不會給我什麽快感的、但同學們不放我、自然不能不答允隨他們一路去、</p>
<p>因爲節省經濟、我們乘中東路的四等車、夜了、車開始前進、我們的車廂並不擁擠、因爲没有别的乘客、但車的震動却令人坐都坐不住、可是睡又不好睡、所以我一夜在這樣的震抖之中没有睡眠、在抖的微弱的燭光下、讀完了一本「奇劍及其他、」</p>
<p>二十餘人中僅有一個女學生、這裏面最滑稽的是宋|他一夜是跟着車的震抖而跳躍、唱、鬧、有的實在太疲倦了、躺在板上睡、但一會不是因車身的搖震而滾下來、就是頭被掽而驚醒、</p>
<p>等太陽在東天發出了紅光、我們知道是快到長春了、</p>
<p>在長春吃過早餐、於是繼續乘吉長路、吉長路的車和南滿車的裝置差不多的、</p>
<p>沿途看見些連綿的山、朴素而簡陋的村、新綠的田疇、……在吃午餐的時候、我們就到了目的地了、</p>
<p>本來我們同吉林一個中學裏約過、寄宿在裏面、忽然事情有了變故、没有法子、由兩個本地的學生領我們到了一家小客棧裏、</p>
<p>最初、我看見而覺得奇怪的、就是吉林女人的裝束、她們的髮髻在頭頂、着男人的長衫和馬褂、聽說這仍是旗人的服裝、</p>
<p>從火車站乘馬車到某中學、由某中學又到客棧裏、這中間所經過的路是那們的崎嶇的、雖然也有一兩條大路是柏油路、但陰溝是露天的、所以路的兩旁常發出臭味、</p>
<p>吉林的房屋也都那們簡陋的、但有的富人們的房屋、他們的大門完全是漆着鮮紅的色、並且、還懸掛着不少金碧的匾額、</p>
<p>我們於是到一個餐館裏吃飯、</p>
<p>吉林生活很低、我們二十餘人也不過吃了七八元哈錢（哈錢一元約值滬洋八角）、吉林的錢又不同哈爾濱同了、一種永吉錢票、一元約值滬洋一半、一種永衡錢票、紙幅很大而且印得很難看、上面印着極細小的字、有的是古文、有時是孟子、論語、……價值有一吊五吊十吊到一千吊（我不知道還有高的没有）、一吊、僅僅值小銅板兩枚、</p>
<p>回到客棧來我已經非常疲倦了、將行李安置好、我就要睡眠、雖然那坑塌很不清潔、</p>
<p>等我醒轉來時、我發現學生們没有一個在屋裏的、我很奇怪他們爲什麽不倦、</p>
<h3>病</h3>
<p>— 椿</p>
<p>病是最可討厭的、然而終於侵襲了我了、固然、我早知道病的潛伏是在不久的時期之内、而且病的徵兆已預示了我的、但我祗想能避免去、不受這麽的纏擾、却事實的到來畢竟違反了我的理想、宣告我是病了、</p>
<p>這實在是不幸的事、我的家庭居然全都遭受了病的命運、甚至連我都不能幸免、當我和病人的眼光接觸時、我樣鋒刃剌般的酸痛、父親病了、大哥病了、二哥病了、都呻吟床第、使全家融和的空氣、爲病的鬱愁而萬般悽凉了、最近、母親因看侍過勞、又病着了、照理、我不該來這繁華的都市奔波、眼看着家中病着的人而不顧的、但是、終於因顧了我自己的將來、勢不得不離開這充滿了病的呻吟的家、而趕着來東奔西走、焉知、不上天、我潛伏的病也竟是發作了、而也呻吟於床第了、</p>
<p>自然、我也不知道忙碌的是爲的什麽、但我相信、　總也有些事並不單爲着我個人的呵、每當遇過隔别才月餘的朋友他們第一句的問話、總是、「你什麽瘦了」這一方面是好意的慰藉、而一方面又是給予了我多少的波動啊、的確、我根本不明白爲什麽而這樣瘦了、呼、這樣瘦了、</p>
<p>在這次的病中、煩惱的絲網自然是繫縛了我的、我想起家中病着的人、不禁思緒愈益煩亂起來、精神也越發興奮起來了、於是燃燒的熱度比例地增加、腦部直如快要炸裂、醫生不免有些大驚小怪、看我那樣的熱度、以爲或許會變成傷寒、其實、我那裏會有傷寒呢、不料學校聽了這話、就奉爲玉律、便馬上寫信告知我父親——我病着的父親、在信中深藏着影射的字句、這、怎麽不便我父親急呢、以爲我眞的病的那樣厲害了、便多方託人、預備設法我回去、在我病了的第三日的晚上、就接連的來了二次人、那時幸已稍痊、不然不要弄假成眞嗎、結果打發他們走了、我相信、在這天晚上、家中的人—尤其疼愛我的父親、一定會異常地不安呵、</p>
<p>寒熱算是凉清了、我便又急着出來了、原來在這病了的幾天中、巳引起了多人的懷慮、甚至疑有不測、到志哥的寓所、他開首就驚奇地問、</p>
<p>「我們正預備登報找你、」</p>
<p>「什麽、這不是太滑稽、」</p>
<p>「有這麽幾天了、你音信都没有、大家都在要找你、却終見不到你、你究在幹什麽呢、」</p>
<p>「你不看我的臉色嗎、我病着啊、今天不得已、才免强出來、」</p>
<p>經我這樣說了、志哥才似乎微微有點相信、似乎相信他的先前的預料是錯了、</p>
<p>但我的疑雲却漸漸濃重起來、我想、「他們爲何要如此懷慮我呢、……」於是我便反問志哥、</p>
<p>「可是你們以爲我是失蹤了、」</p>
<p>「是的、我們以爲你會是失蹤了、因爲你近來的言話不是異樣了嗎、而你近來的行動不也是變態了嗎、有這麽多天没見到面、而且是大家都在找你、那不要奇怪起來、今天我們越談越信以爲眞、以爲你有不測呢、如果今天再不見到你、許眞會登報呢、」</p>
<p>「那倒也很有趣的、」我冷笑着、「無巧不成書、」呵、這次病中居然有這種事發生、眞未始不是不件美談吧、</p>
<p>現在、這病後的時期中、我很知道絕對未有回復我原來的康健、但這人生的推動機巳是不允我享受那所謂靜養的機會、而必須奔波於人世中、父親固曾有信來要我家去養息、然而像這樣情形我可能向沉靜的生活度去嗎、因之父親的好意我未有順從了、姊姊曾多所勸我保重身體、此次病後見了我、除說我瘦的厲害外、其他似乎也不能說什麽了、文質也懇擊的說、要我好好地保重些身體在這病後的幾天、再不可以亂跑亂奔、但一面是心領國激這安慰、一面却達了她們的好意了、實際、我不知道怎樣是好、所謂生命的源泉、我究須怎樣地追求、實是一個難於解决的問題、我祇想不使我的生命太形空虚、而至少能完畢我一部份的生之使命、而這、也或許就是我的「生之奮鬥」了吧、那末、這次病我是可紀念着了、</p>
<h3>不要不加考察就駡人</h3>
<p>— 陳保勤</p>
<p>九月二十四日日本刊（靑年園地）内、陸向閒君的「住亭子樓的人」一篇文章、内容不外乎駡女子不了解戀愛的眞意義、祗以金錢爲目標、這未免太概括一般了、我當然不敢說、是女子個個都不愛金錢、但我們也决不肯承認、凡屬女子皆是拜金主義者、皆是比毒蛇還要毒、皆是禍水、陸君、假使你的文章内「女人……」這種句字上面、加幾個分量字、如「一部分」或「據我所見到的、」甚至於「大多數」「大部分、」那我也决不至於放下正經書不讀、來嚕囌這一大篇、可是陸君的說話太攏統、太不加以考察、怎能使我、緘口如瓶、任我女性妄遭誣衊呢、</p>
<p>陸君現在旣然是攏統的說女人都是愛金錢、那我要問陸君漢朝的「梁鴻孟光、舉案齊眉」、至今傳爲佳話、孟光是不是女人、梁鴻是不是富翁、還有卓文君嫁司馬相如能肯犧牲本來的富貴去當爐賣酒、卓文君是男人還是女人、再拿最近的例子來說黄慧如之願意嫁陸根榮是爲的金錢嗎、其他專門注重才能、學問、和誠實的愛情、而鄙視金錢的女子、正不知有多少、恐怕你皆不曉得罷了、我可以很坦白的根據事實的說、愛絕不是無條件的、所謂「眞誠的愛無條件」這是欺人之談、是唱高調、假如說愛無條件、爲什麽配偶要選擇、婚姻要自主呢、不是爲的要適合自己條件嗎、旣然愛是有條件的、那麽、大凡受過相當敎育、而有高尚的人格與思想、並且具眞實學問的女子、她要求於對方的條件絕對不是金錢、主要的當然是健康、才能、學問、人格、思想、努力、與進取的精神、孟光與卓文君之戀愛梁鴻和司馬相如、便是一個例證、雖然梁鴻與司馬相如一個是春米匠、一個是窮夫、她們也能犧牲一切去愛他們、所以能相敬如賓、永久戀愛、因爲她們所要求的條件、就是帶有永久性的、但是我絕不能强辯的說、女子中間就没有敗類、的確有許多是在我們鄙視之列的、例如一般思想不澈底的女子、往然掛着女學生的招牌、金玉其外、敗絮其中、他們的心目中、只知時髦·裝飾·揮霍·享樂·安逸·放縱等等、根本上就不知什麽呌戀愛、所以要求於對方的條件、相然也不外乎上述的種種、誰能供給便去愛誰、而男性呢、也就利用女性這弱點、於是竭力奉順、惟恐不及、以期達其目的、遂其所欲、可是、一旦目的旣達、所欲旣遂、於是一翻本來面目、誰還再裝腔作勢、硬充財翁、所謂木已成舟、生米成飯、看你有何方法、跳出我這藩籬、不意、今非昔比、舊禮敎已失去了相當威權、竟有一班不肖之徒—在舊禮敎信徒的目光中—不顧什麽三從四德、貞操觀念、不得已朝秦暮楚、一效買　—休夫、這誠是明白昭然的事實、不容否認、其實、男性的心理、何嘗不知道這種女性是拜金的奴隸、明知故犯、這種必</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>然失敗的結果、不加諸他們的身上、更屬何人、於是、重商主義者、禍水、毒蛇、虚榮、勢利、這些美名辭、不一而足、冠賜在女人的頭上、這種偏面的苛責、不亦過甚</p>
<p>至於你說到女人的心比毒蛇還要毒、又有什麽根據、又何見得有許多的男子心不比毒蛇還要毒呢、女子的人格和思想、大概可以隨其所受過的敎育與學識而高下、而在男子、則有許多善於包藏禍心的較女子爲難觀察多了、往往很有知識的男子、他的人格的卑鄙、欺騙的手腕反隨學問的高超而愈加新奇、愈加殘忍、試翻開歷史來看、女子受男子的蹂躪已經有幾千年了、不是專書、眞是寫不盡其中的例子、上自君王、下至百姓、無往而不用摧殘女性的政策、或以無子而被棄、或因色衰而見絕、旣毁其身、復傷其心、女子多數都是痴心的、一朝被棄、終生爲辱、好像永久失却了人生的樂趣、這種棄絕的行爲、施之於無辜的女子、可謂忍心達於極點了、商陵子的「别鶴操」、曹丕曹植的「出婦賦」、無非是哀悼女性横遭　棄之作、「谷風」的詩裏也有色衰愛弛而被棄的謳歌、這全是男子虐待女性的鐵證、可見在三國之前就有這種事寶了、降至隨唐、此風更甚、煬帝荒淫無道、狎玩女子、至於極度、一朝歡樂、永久棄絕、白居易的「上陽人」一詩就是描摹宫人的痛苦、自此以後、更造出什麽貞節、纏足、多妻、納妾、無才便是德、各壓迫女性的計劃來、這一下更是不知戕殺寃屈死多少無辜的女性、再加上原有的舊例、眞是把女子束縛得一動都不敢動、還有禍從天降之憂、到了現在經我們多少次的奮鬭與扎掙才算得到一點小小的自由、可是陷阱同時也設遍了天下、拿最近的事實來說、黄慧如雖然自己没有什麽學問、可是能不重金錢、打破階級觀念去愛陸根榮、這也可以說是專以愛情爲目標了、但是陸根榮究竟是人格卑鄙、心存欺騙、背義忘情、以致弄得黄慧如身死名裂、爲天下笑、再如已往的馬振華又何嘗不是被騙於汪世昌呢、即如最新出的某某重婚案子、也是用騙的手段娶得乙、棄絕甲他竟不想到、當他追逐甲的時候、倘若甲絕對的不接受他的要求、他要怎樣的感覺失戀的痛苦而咀咒甲呢、他不可以說是没有學識的人呀、由此可以證明我前面所說的話了、像這類的事件報端上幾日有記載、其他發生於窮鄉僻壞、以及不曾記載的更不知有多少呢、呵、這原來是人類的進步、毒蛇猛獸、以無知而害人猶爲人類之公敵、人爲萬物之靈、共具惻隱之心、今無故而戕戳欺騙同類的一部分男性、豈不是比毒蛇猛獸還要猛毒嗎、况且女子之棄絕男子、多在未婚之前、男子棄絕女子、多在旣婚之後、其損失孰大孰小、也母容贅言了、在未婚之前而棄絕、就要駡她比毒蛇還要毒、那麽已婚之後而棄絕的要駡他什麽呢、至於未婚之前而棄絕的、又可斷定其過失全在女子單方面嗎、</p>
<p>再說到禍水二字、又指在那一條上呢、現在的時代女子、惹了什麽禍呢、假如在壓史上到可以找到許多例子、可是男子之中奸臣賊子也不少呀、比較起來、恐怕男子所作的禍、還要多過女子、怎能單說女子是禍水呢、總而言之、統而言之、男女之中各有敗類、女子的不好、我已經自己說過了、陸君、你也不要認定你們男子之中全是好人、鍾情的固然也不少、但是因一時的衝動誘惑、朝秦暮楚的人也很多呀、希望陸君下次考一下再駡罷、　　（編者附註）陸君原作、完全是一種客觀的描寫、並不是主觀的批、陸君描住在亭子間、無聊靑年的浪蕩生涯、哼京調、談戀愛、喊窮、……頗爲盡致、所以選登了、現在、陳女士寫這一篇文字來爲女姓方面辯護、本刊也當然尊重、照登如上、以見女性方面對於戀愛問題意見的一般、</p>
<h3>打倒偶像</h3>
<p>— 問鵑</p>
<p>因爲喜歡到窮邊極遠的地方去研究人情風俗、於是僻處塞北的陽城縣、便有了我的足迹、這個縣、穿城祇有三里路、並且還祗有三個城門、北門劈對大靑山、士人以爲開門必定冲犯山神、所以特地城牆之上、築起一座高台、呌做陽相台、俗稱北台、台上一所眞武將軍廟、造得極其考究、雖不能和歸綏的大招小招等相比、可是比他們人住的屋宇、已經是堅固得多了、敎務之暇、常常和同事們走上北台去換換空氣、并且跳望一番邊塞的風景、大靑山障蔽在北方、長城如帶、横繫靑山腰際、山上無一株樹木、而巖石狰獰、和山勢的綿延高大、配著下邊的黄砂萬里、胡風浩浩吹來、别有一種悲凉壯闊的氣概、不是久處江南的人、所能體會得到的、有時天晴日出的時候、白雲縷縷、繚繞在遠峯之定、如天孫織錦、遙望山坡處處、隱約有無數白點、在那邊出没和蠕動、是羊羣放草時的一幅圖畫、有時風順、還可以聽得見牧童們的笛聲、台上牆垜間嵌著一方瀚海石、士人說是、一可以照得見百里外人們的面孔、祇要去照的人、心裏想到誰、就可以看得見誰、然而現在靈迹已被點破、所以照不見了、」這種無稽之談、本不值一笑、但是我却偏要去研究這類謬說的成因究竟是什麽、於是便屢次去撫摩這塊光滑如玻璃似的、花紋燦爛的石頭、希望得到點端倪、但是不成功、什麽理由也不能發見、後來、忽然從許多婦女身上得到一點消息、因爲古時好武、陽城僻處邊界、適當戰爭的衝要、家有壯丁常以出外從軍爲榮耀、於是春閨有夢、常在無定河邊、每思設法得見其夫壻或子弟的一面、好事的人、便造出這個謬說去愚惑婦女、也許還有人靠著這塊石頭吃飯的吧、</p>
<p>自從伏處在這個彈丸之地以來、實在無事可做、校舍是「偏安在一座古廟裏的、共總只有十來間屋宇、佛像倒占去了七間、剩下三間又窄又壞的偏屋、算是女學校的講堂、敎員室只好托庇於佛像的宇下了、我是個不安份的人、對於這些泥塑木雕之称、未免發生厭惡、常思設法除去她、其時正是民國十四年的春間、塞北風氣尤其閉塞、省當局雖是說要努力維新、但其力量實遠不如民間之大、綜計陽城一縣、人口不及十萬、而廟宇倒有二三十所之多、好像把民間所有的物力、通統提供在偶像的身上了、這是長城以内所永遠不能找到的事實、於是我先把縣長說服、要他准請我打倒偶像、縣長是個留學生出身、做人非常圓滑、末了、他贊成我的提議、并且鼓勵我趕快去做、他自己還答應給我帮助、</p>
<p>我回校、便把經過告訴了學生們和同事、她們都拍掌大喜、就紛紛動手、把些小泥小們扔的扔、打的打、霎時間眼前清爽了不少、然而那些大的呢、推不動、搖不動、怎麽辦呢、我們便去招僱工人來打、但是出了重價、也無一人前來應募、甚至呌化子都也不肯、過了十天、我們知道僱人算是絕望、然而我這個倔强人、事情開了端、就肯這樣罷休的嗎、不、縣長旣然出過口、當不至自食其言、使我進退維谷的、見了縣長的結果是、由他撥一批犯人到學校來、工價歸學校發給、每日四角、鐵鎖鎯鐺的十多個烟犯和積窮被帶到廟裏來了、一個消瘦異常的高個子先行開口、「先生、我們雖是犯罪、我們還要修修來世、在陽間受了苦、將來到陰間去不願再受苦了、打神聖的事情我不幹、先生、你聽他們幹吧、」一時衆犯人都垂了頭、好像各人在計算各人的心事、「你們不要害怕、這事不關你們、是我呌你們來、有禍殃都歸我一人担當、不與你們相干、」他們聽了我這幾句很簡捷的說話以後、彷彿已經是上達天聽、各人面上的憂色便也减輕了許多、然而幾個本地人、還在推三托四、或是互相用眉眼關照、表示不要冐這大險的意思、我生恐又被他們破壞、向這些人的面上輪流一看、見有一個山東人的胆子似乎比較大、也彷彿對　於運命已具有較深的反抗性、不相信不打神聖會使他的生活變得更好些、况且一日四角、十日就是四塊、究竟比天天空坐要來得好吧、他於是首先向我說明可以去做、但要先拿工錢、我怕他滑頭、商量的結果、是、先支兩角、等放工時再拿兩角、於是七八個不願的、都一齊回去了、剩下五個、跟我走到東殿裏立定、這是一間供奉雜亂的小偶像的地方、除開三個坐的以外、其餘都是站的、不過六尺來高、按理、或不致十分難毁的吧、可是五個人拿了繩索、呆呆地好像不能夠下手的樣子、我明白、便走上去先把繩圈子、套住在泥人的頭上、用力拉了一把、回頭向衆人道、「好了、這不關你們的事了、」他們方趦趄著上去拉了半天、一個泥人跌倒了、於是招出去放在校前荒地上、半日光陰、只去了三個、還祇有十點多鐘、他們就要去吃飯了、下午直到兩點才來、四點半又都去了、如此做了幾天、東殿總算出空、然而那些堆在校外的泥人屍體、又必須僱車送出城外去抛棄方好、庶務出去呌車又碰了許多釘子、說是、「我們怕遭雷擊不敢拉、」我用老法子去勸說、他們也不肯、怎麽辦呢、從大街到學校的一條路上、連日已如山陰道上、鬨滿了看熱鬧的男男女女、老太婆拄了拐杖也來看、都指指點點地驚訝着她們平日所人仰的偶像的遭逢刦運、而對於我的怨毒也如海樣的深、有人說我是魔王轉世、又有人說也是神聖的刦運該到、近以天上差了我來打她們的、學生們被禁在家裏、不許她們再來和我接近、幸而省政府行的是强迫敎育、官廳可以用命令催促學生上學的、我又要求縣長帮助、他無法、只好呌人去挨户催促、於是我的好學生們又一齊來到了、後來知道就是不催、她們的父母也要送來的、因爲她們在家裏都鬧着斷食反抗的計畫、也不知是誰敎她們的、大概她們的年齡、已到了能夠反抗壓迫的時候了吧、邊塞的高小學生、起碼是都有十六七歲的了、事後、縣長忽然大宴其客、有人探得他的内容是、全爲了聲明打倒偶像一事、係由女校長主動、不與他自己相干、我們聽了也就付之一笑、師生合作、把泥人掩埋在校旁空地以後、我又和他們奮門了半年、方離開這邊境而回到内地來、事後想想、對於自己的這塲蠻幹、也未免有點好笑、</p>

<h3>告辭</h3>
<p>— 宓羅</p>
<p>——别兩年的同事們——</p>
<p>等待搖鈴只有十分鐘光景、懷裏的鐵、很可以清晣地聽到悉索悉索的刻板的響着、一顆心給牠逗引得益發蕩蕩、幾乎和奏着錶的機聲、一樣着跳動、</p>
<p>眼前、只得得一派莫名的慘淡、掛着對面屋角上的一道陽光、今天也像格外來得乏力了、戀戀地却不肯遽下屋角、</p>
<p>「悉索悉索」、絲毫不見得弛緩、我的心從熱烈的震動而漸漸地趨到平靜、又木然、但終久給鈴聲響起而驚醒了、我像平時一樣的立起、離開我寫字檯、整了整我的衣袖、　着一個紙包隨同事們踱出辦公室、</p>
<p>「這是最後的」刹那吧、我將離開我兩年來的同事們了、」我想起、巳經走出了大門、我想有幾句話要向同事們話别、只是提不起這股勇氣了、除了像往日同樣的點了點頭、勉强說了一聲再會、</p>
<p>想起兩年來經過、敎我怎樣離開我許多親愛的同事們、自從我踏遍了生命的血跡、在棘途中挺起利刃衝破了惡劣的環境、走到上海來讀書、勉强在一個中學裏畢業、經濟的困厄、已經高高地築上一座債臺、事實上已經不許我再去外學、那時、便仗着一位堂兄的介紹、進這上士地局裏當一個學習員、兩年以來、蒙到當局的格外優異、許多許多同事們的提携、尤其視我如弟的我們的主任李先生、他給了我學識上的指示、辦事上的督勵、種種和藹的、仁慈的、領導我向世路中前進、眞是使我將永久不能有一刻的遺忘、</p>
<p>在辦事上旣然得到了許多同事誠摯的指示、因此兩年來終算没有多大錯過、遺留着過去史上、并且、從學習員而助理員、而辦事員、逐級的予我遷升、薪水也從三十元而四十元而五六十元了、在我窮窘的生活上、使得我不致感受到凍餒、而晚間讀書的學費、也從這裏得到了、眞的、除了我已經遺失我良心的話、我怎忍輕易離開此地呢、</p>
<p>然而我終久離開此地、辜負了殷殷　切的挽勸、不顧一切的勇往直前了·我眞的已經遺失了良心了嗎、這裏、我只有萬分歉忱之外、我簡直無話足以自解了、</p>
<p>想起行年二十有二、驚惶得我不能有一刻的案定、在幼時的心裏、巴不得馬上長成、和人家一樣的又高又大、可是年歲一年一年增大、自從父親的逝世、而慈母見背、大姊的病喪、弟弟的客死病院種種拂逆頻仍、跟着我的生命史同時進展、十年飲泣中、我已儼然的長大成人、於是我的憂懼心也油然生長、好像有說不出的羞頳、自己已經是二十二歲、人家還不知趣的問我靑春幾何、我眞無可奈何的回答他、暗怪他大不識相、使我難於置答、</p>
<p>二十二歲已經到了、二十三歲馬上會來臨、天天在渾噩中過去、我的將來是怎樣一個結果、時代宛在推波逐浪中、處於一刻不得停留的汎動裏、一刹眼便要落伍、何况自己的學識未充、能力薄弱、眼前的敷衍、豈是長久的策計麽、我不甘自認終久是一個低能兒、我原也有天賦我一副完備的軀殻、小小的智慧、我怎能辜負我、辜負了一般期望於我的呢、於是升學的轉念、時刻在我腦裏緊廻、最後毅力地决定、「我捨了努力求學」以外、簡直没有第二條路、</p>
<p>我决然向當局請求、一、可否准我半</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>工半讀、二、如不能准賜辭職、</p>
<p>呈文上了、當局再三的規勸、說是半工半讀不可能、敎我不必讀書、并且歷述許多先例、「上進不一定升學」、我惟有感激他一番好意、事實上我再不能有半點畏縮、我暫時要忘却感情、辜負厚意、走了、走了、</p>
<p>兩年來升學的夢想、到今日纔實現、自己只有感覺到自己的大胆了、搿上書包、彳亍着江灣道上、秋風巳銳利的吹來、摸摸袋裏還夠幾天的支持呢、「衣食住行是缺一不可的啊、」我想起了暗暗地村量、</p>
<p>眞的、誠如當局的訓示、「受敎育要看人的所遇、」以我的環境、升學的資格早巳剝削殆盡了、不過、我以爲、没有錢不能升學、和有了錢妄用是没有什麽分别、假使我多着家富的話、席豐履厚、過我公子王孫的生涯時、恐怕早没有升學上進的思念了、惟其我窮、窮小子纔肯讀書、天下事必待有了錢纔幹、不一定是可以成功、荆棘的披漸纔有康莊大道可走、我於無可如何中這樣自慰、</p>
<p>今後、我於此宣誓、</p>
<p>「我永將抛棄我的悲哀、不值得再追維我的往事、我更將掉轉我的思想、不再歌謳着雪月風花、我更將堅勵我的意識、向上前進跟着我中華民族的旗幟、任西北風吹得我肉體發抖并於我的筋骨未曾吹懈絲毫、任肚子餓得灌些河水充饑、於我的精神未曾半點退餒、個人的享樂、我不希冀、本來時代的凄鴻、流離失所的有幾許、我從此要充實我的學識、鍜鍊我的體魄、準備着躍馬横弓、等待我們中華民族需要我犧牲的時機、」</p>
<p>潦倒的末路早在預料中、並不驚奇和嘆息、生活的體騐、纔會不平凡的空負我生、我忍痛的别我許多同事們、最後希冀着各自努力、</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Revolutionary Tide in South America and Its Relationship to the Economy</h3>
<p>I have repeatedly said it. Today, because of the decline in commerce in various countries around the world, economic difficulties have resulted. Because of economic difficulties, opposition parties in the country have taken the opportunity to attack the government. By the time the government has fallen and been replaced by the opposing party in power, it is still unable to save the country's economic difficulties and the decline in world commerce. Then the political situation still cannot be stabilized, and those who overthrow the government in various countries will go in circles without a peaceful day. Isn't it the same with the recent revolutionary tide in various countries in South America? After Bolivia, Peru followed. After Peru, Argentina followed. It is said that the revolution in Argentina was for economic reasons rather than political ones. In fact, Bolivia and Peru were no different.</p>
<p>The regions of South American countries are small and their economic strength is weak. Therefore, once there are difficulties, it is easy to launch [a revolution]. The major powers outside of Europe, America, and Asia, the governments of which are currently worried, are no different from these countries, and what is being squeezed in these countries today is no different. In the future, political turmoil caused by this will be no different. The United States' vigorous implementation of government streamlining, Japan's difficulty in completing the budget, and Germany's hesitation in finance are all so-called harbingers of this opportunity. If the decline in world commerce does not turn around, the political turmoil in various countries will be difficult to avoid. If world industry and commerce do not change their methods, the decline in world commerce will not turn around. I dare to say so.</p>

At the time of the accident, the ship was flying very low. One of the survivors, named Ridge, an engineer, told a Reuters reporter that everyone except the lookouts and pilots were asleep when the accident occurred. The engines were running well, and the airship was flying through wind and rain, rising and falling three times. Suddenly, a strong gust of wind came, the ship was blown down, and with a crash, the ship broke apart. The bodies have not yet been recovered, and part of the ship is still on fire.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bouvain, 5th: It is now known that there are a total of ten survivors of the British airship R101 disaster. Eight of them are seriously injured and have been admitted to the hospital, while the other two are unharmed. According to villagers, they saw the lights of an airship in the wind and rain this morning around 2:00 AM, flying very low and seemingly in difficulty. In an instant, there was a loud explosion, and the fire was raging.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bouvain, 5th: It is now confirmed that there are only eight survivors of the R101. Thirty-two bodies have been recovered so far.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: The loss of the airship R101 has shocked the entire nation. It is a tragedy that the world's largest airship was lost, and among the victims are Aviation Minister Thomson, Director of Civil Aviation for the Postal Aviation Department Lieutenant General Brancker, and several of Britain's most famous airship experts, such as the Director-General of Airship Development Colmore, who presided over all British airship affairs. There was also Major Scott, who flew the airship R34 from England to the United States in 1919 and then flew back. Also, there was Colonel Richmond, who designed and built the K101. These three people flew to Canada on the airship R100 this summer. Others, such as R101 Captain Irwin, were all outstanding talents in the aviation industry. The R101 had recently been lengthened to increase the gas capacity by 500,000 cubic feet, so the ship was as long as 770 feet. The passenger area was divided into two levels, and its spaciousness was unmatched by any other airship. The dining room could accommodate 50 people, and there was a special smoking room that was fireproof. The kitchen was equipped with electrical appliances, so there was no fear of fire. The bedrooms were large and magnificent, painted in gold and silver and decorated with blue curtains. The R101's engines were initially powered by heavy oil fuel, which was one of the important features of the "safety first" principle. There were five crew members and thirty-seven staff members on board, all wearing newly made dark blue uniforms. Except for Colmore and the other two, who were military officers, the rest were civilian personnel.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Assembly Holds Final Meeting</h3>
<p>Labor Government Could Fall at Any Time</p>
<p>British Chief Delegate's Meaning Behind Words</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 4th: At the final meeting of the League of Nations Assembly, the British representative Cecil spoke, saying that this might be his last speech at the League of Nations Assembly. Tonight, a Reuters reporter met Cecil and asked what he meant. Cecil replied that the British Labor government could fall at any time, and it was not known whether the future government would want him to serve in Geneva.</p>
<p>Demand for Reorganization of Secretariat</p>
<p>Five Major Powers in Control</p>
<p>Interests of Small Countries in Jeopardy</p>
<p>Geneva News: The smaller member states of the League of Nations have recently expressed their protest against the fact that the Secretariat of the League of Nations is effectively controlled by the major powers of Britain and France, making it difficult for the opinions and interests of the smaller countries to be fully expressed and maintained. They have formed a group, unanimously expressing their protest and demanding that the Secretariat be reorganized, with the intention that the distribution of key positions be spread among all member states as equitably as possible. The League of Nations includes three major organizations: first, the General Assembly, which opens every September; second, the Administrative Council, which is composed of the member states elected by the General Assembly; and third, the Secretariat. To observers unfamiliar with the situation, it may seem that the Secretariat is the least important of the three major organizations, but this conclusion is contrary to the facts. According to experts of the League of Nations, the Secretariat is the most important of the League of Nations' organizations, because any issue submitted by various parties for discussion by the League must first go through a relevant part of the Secretariat, which will conduct a detailed study and then prepare a report, which will be submitted to the General Assembly or the Administrative Council for final decision and implementation. Therefore, if the person in charge of the relevant part of the Secretariat is French or British, then their views will naturally tend towards the French or British side, and are not absolutely "international." The so-called League of Nations officials, both high and low, all hold the League of Nations' perspective and an international mindset is, in fact, not so easy to achieve. At present, the staff of the various departments of the Secretariat are overwhelmingly British and French, followed by Italian, Japanese and German nationals, whereas the number of citizens of smaller member states working in the Secretariat is probably no more than two or three. These countries, for their own interests, have jointly demanded a reorganization of the distribution of staff in the Secretariat, so that the important positions are distributed as evenly as possible among the member states. Even Italy, although it is one of the five countries with the most positions, is supporting the reorganization of the Secretariat. (The World)</p>
<h3>Amendment to Charter Stalled</h3>
<p>Due to Strong Support and Opposition</p>
<p>But a Small Committee Seeks Negotiation</p>
<p>Geneva News: The Japanese representative Ito Noefumi openly opposed harmonizing the Kellogg-Briand Pact with the League Covenant. The final decision on the Covenant amendment will be postponed until the next year. The British representative criticized the Japanese side's opposition to amending the Covenant, saying that among those who advocate dissenting opinions regarding the obligation to abolish war "as a means of conducting national policy" which is contained in the basic covenant of the League, Japan is the only one. Representative Ito stated that he had deep doubts as to what important changes the Kellogg-Briand Pact had brought to international law, and launched many attacks. Another party unofficially distributed an opinion stating that countries should not be deprived of the right to wage war to ensure justice for their country. Because opinions are strongly divided regarding the amendment to the Covenant, a small committee was formed consisting of legal experts from Japan, China, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Romania, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Finland, and Uruguay to propose a negotiation plan.

<h3>French Government Orders Crackdown on Russian Imports</h3>
<p>Preventing Trade Competition National Affairs, Paris, 4th: The French government has ordered a crackdown on the import of Russian goods that are below world market prices. The Minister of Commerce explained that this measure was necessary to address the increasingly severe trade deficit. The French government has no intention of prohibiting or discriminating against Russian goods, but only to protect domestic goods and prevent intense competition. In the first six months of this year, French goods exported to Russia were worth 190 million francs, while Russian goods exported to France were worth 44.1 million francs. Currently, the Russian goods most affected are wheat, sugar, and timber.</p>
<h3>Franco-German Business Cooperation</h3>
<p>Recent New Developments</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in German-American Trade</h3>
<p>National Affairs, Paris, 4th: There have recently been new developments in Franco-German business cooperation. A Franco-German colonial company has been established here with a capital of 5 million francs, which can be increased to 10 million, with the aim of promoting trade in French colonial products and German industrial products.</p>
<p>National Affairs, Hamburg, 4th: German-American trade has been greatly affected by the economic recession. Both the quantity and total value have declined sharply. In the first six months of this year, German imports from the United States decreased by 21.94 million marks compared to the same period last year, about 23 percent. German exports to the United States also decreased by 11.82 million marks, about 24 percent. Among them, cotton, copper, fruits, and automobiles have decreased the most. However, the trade deficit with the United States, which was 66.67 million marks in the same period the year before last, decreased to 45.16 million marks last year, and has further decreased to 35.04 million marks this year, which is beneficial to Germany.</p>
<h3>Poland Expands Navy</h3>
<p>Alexia Parliament Passes Bill</p>
<p>Approves Annual Appropriation of 250,000 Polish Zloty National Affairs, Katowice, 4th: The Alexia local council has passed a motion by the ruling party to include an annual expenditure of 250,000 Polish zloty in the local budget to support the expansion of the Polish navy.</p>
<h3>Cause of Argentina's Revolution</h3>
<p>Not Political but Economic</p>
<p>New Government's Position Still Not Consolidated</p>
<p>Associated Press, Argentina, 4th: The Argentine provisional government has declared an indefinite nationwide state of siege.</p>
<p>News from the capital of Argentina: In the past two and a half months, three armed revolutions have suddenly erupted in South America. The presidents of Bolivia, Celes, Peru, Riguia, and Argentina, Irigoyen, have been successively ousted. The root cause is not political but economic. In a nutshell, it is the low prices of export goods in various South American republics. In Argentina, this is especially true for meat and grains. In this time of global trade stagnation and economic recession, it is naturally difficult for the government to do anything. However, the opposition took advantage of this to stir up trouble. Regarding the Argentine incident, there are other incidental reasons. Irigoyen retired after completing his term as president in 1922, remaining in seclusion and not involved in politics for six years until he regained national power in 1928. Since then, the exchange rate of the Argentine currency has gradually fallen, and it is getting worse. Although Irigoyen's governance was mostly excellent in other aspects, he often made mistakes in finance because he did not like to consult experts. Also, Irigoyen often interfered in the administration of various provinces that enjoyed considerable autonomy, which caused dissatisfaction among the provinces that were interfered with. This is also one of the reasons why Irigoyen was attacked. From the above, it can be seen that as long as Argentina's economic problems and financial policies are unstable, there is a risk of revolution erupting. It is not something that can be solved by the departure or retention of one person. Therefore, it is difficult to make a rash judgment on whether the position of the new President Uriburu is stable before he clearly announces his political program and achieves effective results.

<h3>Brazilian Coup Not Yet Settled</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 4th: A telegram from the capital of Argentina stated that 300 people had been detained in the Brazilian capital due to the coup. It was reported that fighting had broken out in two states, and reports from Brazil were being heavily censored.</p>
<h3>German Election Results Have Repercussions</h3>
<p>Rise of the Fascist Party</p>
<p>Hesitation of Central Parties</p>
<p>Difficulties of Future Political Situation</p>
<p>Bankruptcy of Parliamentary Politics</p>
<p>Among recent international events, none has had a greater impact on the world than the German general election. This is because the German parliamentary re-election not only changed the political situation in Germany, but also changed the diplomatic situation in Europe and even the world. Recently, as the world economy has entered a period of panic, capitalist countries are all facing the difficulties of overproduction and increased unemployment, with Germany being particularly affected. Since the end of the European War, Germany has gradually recovered its pre-war status through recuperation, but on the one hand, industrial production lacks sales outlets, and on the other hand, the burden of reparations and war debts is too heavy, so the economy and finance have fallen into heavy difficulties. The number of unemployed workers has reached 5 million, and more than 1,000 businesses go bankrupt every month. People's livelihoods have become a major problem, and the state treasury is empty, with expenditures exceeding revenues. Under this economic crisis, the political situation is becoming increasingly precarious. Brüning's coalition cabinet of central parties dissolved the parliament because the financial bill could not be passed in the parliament, and held re-elections in the hope of gaining the support of the people. For two months, various political parties have engaged in electoral competition, giving speeches and campaigning tirelessly. As a result of the election, the number of seats of various political parties in the parliament has undergone significant changes, and the impact of these changes on Germany's domestic and foreign affairs cannot be taken lightly.</p>
<p>German political parties have always been divided into numerous factions, unlike Britain and the United States, which only have ruling parties and opposition parties. More than 30 political parties participated in this German election, of which those on the right side were the National Socialist Party (i.e., the Fascist Party) and the German National People's Party. Those on the left were the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party. Those in the middle were the Centre Party (i.e., the Catholic Party), the People's Party, the People's Conservative Party, the National Party (i.e., the reorganized former Democratic Party), the Economic Party, the Bavarian People's Party, the Rural League, the Christian Social Party, and other small parties. Brüning's coalition government was formed by the central small parties representing the bourgeoisie. Although the combined number of seats of these small parties barely exceeded half, the Social Democratic Party, which occupied the most seats in the parliament, did not join the coalition cabinet, and the National Party on the right side was extremely strong. Therefore, the government had to dissolve the parliament and hold new elections. On September 14, a parliamentary election was held throughout Germany. The total number of votes cast was nearly 35 million, accounting for 80 percent of the total number of voters, which was 5 million more than the previous election. This shows the German people's attention to this election. The German election adopted an absolute proportional representation system, with one member of parliament elected for every 60,000 voters. Therefore, the previous parliament only had 492 members, while the new parliament has increased to 573 members. The number of seats obtained by each party and the comparison with the previous election are as follows, according to the numbers obtained at the time the reporter submitted the manuscript:</p>
<p>Number of Seats Won Number of Seats in Previous Parliament</p>
<p>National Socialist Party 107 12</p>
<p>German National People's Party 41 78</p>
<p>People's Conservative Party 2</p>
<p>Hanoverian Party 5</p>
<p>People's Party 26 45</p>
<p>Economic Party 23 23</p>
<p>Centre Party 69 62</p>
<p>Bavarian People's Party 18 16</p>
<p>Rural League 18 13</p>
<p>German Peasants' Party 6 8</p>
<p>National Party (Former Democratic Party) 22 25</p>
<p>Christian Social Party 14</p>
<p>Agricultural League 3 3</p>
<p>Social Democratic Party 143 153</p>
<p>Communist Party 76 54</p>
<p>From the above results, it can be seen that the greatest winners in this election were the National Socialist Party on the far right and the Communist Party on the far left. Although the Social Democratic Party still occupies the most seats in the new parliament, its power has gradually declined. In addition, all the parties in the middle, except for the Centre Party, which was able to maintain its original power, suffered great setbacks. The result was the opposite of what the government had hoped for, so it is a definite conclusion that this election was the government's biggest failure.</p>
<p>The most elated in this election was the National Socialist Party, i.e., the Fascist Party. The leader of this party is an Austrian worker, Hitler, who has not yet become a German citizen. He advocates overthrowing the democratic republic system, implementing Italy's one-party dictatorship, abolishing the Treaty of Versailles, restoring Germany's annexed territories in the east, demanding overseas colonies, expanding the German army, and implementing the annexation of Germany and Austria. In short, he openly declares Germany's revenge. Domestically, he plagiarizes the social party's program, advocating the abolition of unearned property, confiscating the industries of those who became rich during the war, and solving the unemployment problem. Although this party is the most reactionary party, its program is mostly hasty and difficult to implement, but because the German people have been poor and uneasy in recent years, there are many who agree with it. This party has also imitated Mussolini in organizing armed party troops and stirring up trouble everywhere. In this election, it actually received the votes of more than 8.5 million voters, leaping from a small party with 12 seats to a large party with 107 seats. Except for the Social Democratic Party, no one in the new parliament has greater power. The Communist Party, which stands in the opposite position to this party, is also the same. In this election, the Communist Party changed its long-standing strategy by observing the people's inclination, temporarily abandoning the slogans of class struggle and proletarian dictatorship, and vigorously promoting the abolition of the treaty and the abolition of reparations, in order to win the hearts of general nationalists. As a result, the number of seats in this party was increased by half, becoming the third largest party in the parliament. The simultaneous victory of these two extreme left and extreme right parties shows that the German bourgeoisie and proletariat are dissatisfied with the current reform, advocating overthrowing the current situation, abandoning the treaty, and restoring the losses of the Great War. This is obvious. We all know that the reactionaries and communists in Germany all advocate alliances with Italy and Russia in order to revive the war of revenge. If this kind of mentality is prevalent throughout Germany, then France's continental policy will suffer a major blow. Briand (French Foreign Minister) and Zawoski (Polish Foreign Minister) will probably not be able to sleep peacefully from now on. Diplomats in Geneva, although they are standing tall on the podium and singing the empty rhetoric of the European Federation, the clouds of war in Europe are becoming increasingly tense. The results of the German election are its omen.</p>
<p>As for the domestic political aspect, the election results will inevitably lead to the fall of the Brüning cabinet. After that, the solution to Germany's political situation only has two options: one is a right-wing coalition cabinet, which is formed by the National Socialist Party, the German National People's Party, the People's Conservative Party, and the Centre Party; the other is a grand coalition cabinet, which is based on the current cabinet and includes the Social Democratic Party, with the Social Democratic Party holding the central position. The future trend will depend on the will of President Hindenburg, because President Hindenburg occupies a key position in German politics. If Hindenburg orders the Social Democratic Party to form a coalition cabinet when the new parliament is convened on the 7th of next month, then there will be no major changes in domestic and foreign affairs for a while. However, the central parties representing the bourgeoisie have conflicting political views with the Social Democratic Party. In particular, the leader of the Socialist Party, Braun (i.e., the current Prime Minister of Prussia), and President Hindenburg are irreconcilable, so whether this kind of coalition cabinet can become a reality is a big question. As for the right-wing coalition cabinet, if it is established, Germany's foreign policy will undergo a major change, and the European international situation will become more chaotic. However, the National Socialist Party's demands for the formation of a cabinet are extremely harsh, and the moderate parties may not be able to cooperate with it. Therefore, there is no good solution to the current political situation, whether to the left or to the right. In a multi-party system, after the two extreme parties on the left and right have won a great victory, the organization of the government will inevitably become a problem. After the new parliament is convened, it may be dissolved again soon, or even a coup may break out, overthrowing the constitution and implementing a dictatorship. In Germany, which is currently in turmoil and unrest, this is not impossible. Since the democratic revolution, Germany has adopted a republican system for twelve years, but the domestic political turmoil has never stopped. The results of this election have brought the political situation into a maze that has never been seen before. With the excellence and organizational skills of the German nation, the test of democracy has still encountered such obstacles. Is it that democracy is not suitable for the trend of the times? I hope that those who are obsessed with parliamentary politics will reflect on this. (Hua Lu) Sent from Paris on September 16, 1930.</p>
<h3>German Social Democrats May Cooperate with Government</h3>
<p>National Affairs, Berlin, 4th: The German Social Democratic Party has issued a resolution, the content of which is extremely vague and smooth, so the government's newspapers regard it as at least a willingness to express goodwill neutrality towards the cabinet. Opposition newspapers believe that it still leaves room for them to oppose the cabinet's financial reform plan. As for Goebbels, the leader of the National Socialist Party in the parliament, he delivered a speech here before meeting with Prime Minister Brüning, which has closed the way for the party to coordinate with the current government. Therefore, many outside observers believe that Brüning's cabinet will decide to find ways to cooperate with the Social Democratic Party.</p>
<h3>Jerusalem Arabs and Jews Clash</h3>
<p>Arising from Dispute over Cemetery Ownership</p>
<p>Reuters, Jerusalem, 4th: In Haifa, Arabs, whether Muslim or Jewish, are now in a major conflict over the ownership of a cemetery, injuring several people. One reporter from a Jewish newspaper was also killed. People throughout Palestine are disturbed by this. This matter initially seemed unimportant, but now it is quite worrying, because mutual hostility is now spreading elsewhere. Yesterday, a Jewish Arab committed an act of desecration against Islam after the Muslim Friday prayers, leading to a fight.</p>
<h3>Czech Whip Party Members Accused</h3>
<p>Secretly Colluding with Foreign Countries</p>
<p>Conspiring Against the Government</p>
<p>Prague, 4th (National News Agency) – Former Czechoslovak Chief of Staff General Gajda, along with ninety-five other prominent members of the Whip Party, have been accused of treason for allegedly colluding with the Italian Whip Party and the German National Socialist Party in the hope of obtaining foreign assistance and plotting an uprising. Furthermore, the extent of the party's relationship with the former Moscow Comintern government is currently under investigation. It is reported that former Soviet Ambassador to France, Fyodor Raskolnikov, published in a newspaper that Moscow had previously engaged in political and economic relations with the German National Socialist Party several years ago. Therefore, the Czech Whip Party is also suspected of having a similar relationship.</p>
<h3>German Military Officer Case Adjudicated</h3>

<p>Reuters, Leipzig, 4th – The case against German junior military officers Schlinger, Ruding, and Winde, who were accused of conspiracy to commit treason, was concluded today. The three defendants were each sentenced to eighteen months of imprisonment and ordered to pay court costs. It is reported that Schlinger and Ruding have already been dismissed from their military positions, while Winde resigned voluntarily a year ago. After the case is closed, the three will be detained in a fortress for one year. The time spent in detention awaiting trial will be deducted by six months.</p>
<p>Domestic News</p>
<h3>Central Army Advances to Kaifeng</h3>
<p>Tickets for Westbound Longhai Line Trains Reach Minquan. News from Xuzhou indicates that the Central Army on the Longhai Line, after capturing the county seat of Lanfeng on the morning of the 30th, continued its westward advance. The right wing, consisting of the troops of Fan Xiji, Ruan Zhaochang, Jin Handing, and others, and the left wing, consisting of the troops of Chiang Ting-wen, Yang Shengzhi, and others, advanced separately. Feng's army had deployed its defenses in eastern Henan, with Lanfeng being the most heavily fortified. With the fall of Lanfeng, Kaifeng was in imminent danger. Today (the 3rd), according to a telegram received by the Transportation Headquarters from the front lines, the Central Army arrived at Kaifeng Railway Station at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. Feng's troops in the Bian garrison had already retreated westward in droves. Feng's troops in Zhuxianzhen, Chenliu, Tongxu, and Weishi, south of Kaifeng, had been engaged in fierce fighting with the units of the Central Army that had outflanked them from the Pinghan Line. With the retreat, they also withdrew westward. It is observed that Feng's army is urgently transporting troops to Zhengzhou, intending to retreat entirely to Hebei. According to railway sources, the damage to the railway tracks caused by Feng's army's retreat was not extensive. Tickets for westbound Longhai Line trains began reaching Minquan on the 3rd, and military trains reached Lanfeng. Telephone communication extended to Luowang. According to military sources, Feng has expressed his intention to step down, and negotiations are underway for the reorganization of his troops. Commander-in-Chief Chiang has telegraphed Ma Fuxiang and Zhang Zhijiang to the front lines to discuss the resettlement of Feng's troops and the rehabilitation of the Northwest. The Central Army on the Pinghan Line is swiftly flanking Zhengzhou and Luoyang and will likely capture them soon. Qian Zongze previously dispatched the Chief of the Transportation Office, Lü Yunsun, to Wuhan to work with representatives from the Pinghan Railway to handle transportation. Now, Zhang Guohua, the Director of the Office stationed at the front lines, has been dispatched by plane to the Pinghan Line to prepare for military transportation to Zhengzhou. (3rd) Another report states that the Central Army on the Longhai Line occupied Kaifeng Railway Station on the evening of the 2nd. Initially, there was still a portion of Feng's army covering the retreat in Kaifeng city. The various units of the Central Army immediately attacked Bian city. Feng's troops retreated towards Chenqiao in Hebei overnight. The 26th Army of Fan Xiji attacked the northeast gates of Kaifeng from the right wing, while the 2nd Training Division of Zhang Zhizhong attacked the south gate of Kaifeng from the left wing, and they successively entered the city. In this battle, Feng's army retreated hastily and did not have time to destroy the railway lines. One large locomotive and over thirty carriages were abandoned at Kaifeng Station and captured by the Central Army. The units of the Central Army have been advancing westward at full speed. Today (the 4th), according to a telephone call from Lanfeng, the vanguard of the Central Army has passed Zhongmu, reached Baisha, and is advancing rapidly towards Zhengzhou. The railway lines near Kaifeng have not been damaged, and transportation is recovering rapidly. The Railway Bureau has scheduled daily round-trip passenger trains between Xuzhou and Bian starting from the 4th. The passenger train from Xuzhou Station departs westward at 7:30 AM, and the passenger train from Bian Station arrives in Xuzhou at 9:20 PM. However, the telegraph lines to Kaifeng have not yet been repaired. Telegraph communication to Lanfeng was expected to be fully restored by the morning of the 4th. (4th)</p>
<h3>Taiyuan's Security and Finance</h3>
<p>Widespread Rumors, Tense Financial Situation. Taiyuan Correspondent: The situation in Taiyuan city has recently resembled a martial law zone. Various military, police, and constitutional agencies have dispatched a large number of soldiers to patrol the streets day and night. Rumors are rampant, causing considerable unease among the people. Therefore, the provincial government, the garrison headquarters, and other agencies have issued several announcements, which are visible in every street and alley. The garrison headquarters, citing the imminent arrival of winter and the ease with which petty thieves can operate, also convened a winter defense conference yesterday, attended by military and police agencies. It was decided to establish a joint military, police, and constitutional inspection team at the north and south gates, deploying one lieutenant officer and thirty soldiers to each location to conduct inspections of pedestrians and maintain public order. Furthermore, the district offices of the city have recently, due to the unstable situation and military tensions, held security conferences convened by District Chief Yao of the First District in the meeting room of the district office. It is reported that the outcome of the discussions was that each district will select twenty capable police officers to form a night patrol team, with a patrol officer appointed as the team leader. Firearms are currently being issued, and intensive training is underway. The teams will be formally established and begin patrolling the streets at night soon.</p>
<p>As for the financial situation, it is extraordinarily tense, unprecedented in recent history. Businesses have stopped selling goods, and grain stores are not selling rice or flour. Merchants and wealthy households who hold Jin currency regard it as worthless. The prices of all retail goods in the market change several times a day. On the 19th, a bag of flour cost five yuan and sixty cents. On the 20th, it cost six yuan and forty cents. On the 21st, it had already risen to eight yuan and twenty cents, and there was only a quoted price but no actual goods available. Small-milled flour cost thirteen yuan and fifty cents per hundred catties in the morning of the 19th, fourteen yuan in the afternoon, sixteen yuan on the 20th, and eighteen yuan on the 21st. Similarly, Parisian wool fabric cost nine jiao per foot on the 19th and one yuan and forty jiao on the 20th. The prices of all other goods have increased. Merchants who previously aimed to attract customers now greet them with furrowed brows. As of the 21st, every hundred yuan in silver could be exchanged for two hundred and twenty yuan in paper currency. However, even with paper currency, it is impossible to exchange it for silver. Furthermore, remittances from Taiyuan to other cities have been suspended for several days. The general public feels extremely burdened by the cost of living. As for how the authorities will rectify the situation in the future, no concrete measures have been proposed. The value of all kinds of goods continues to rise sharply.</p>
<h3>The Recapture of Yongzhou, Hunan Province: An Account</h3>
<p>Tang Shengming and Others Retreat to Quanzhou. Changsha Correspondent: The Gui Clique's Tang Shengming, Yan Renyi, Wang Ge, Feng Tianzhu, and others took advantage of the Communist bandits' attack on Changsha to occupy Yongzhou and advance towards Hengbao. He Jian forced Tang Shengming and others to retreat to Dong'an to await negotiations for their incorporation. Thereupon, the Xiangnan Garrison Commander, Brigade Commander Duan Heng, seized the opportunity to recapture Yongzhou. Unexpectedly, while the incorporation issue was being negotiated, the Gui army again attempted to enter Hunan, and Tang and others reoccupied Yongzhou and invaded Qiyang. Upon hearing this, He Jian immediately telegraphed Duan Heng in secret, instructing him to assemble a superior force as soon as possible, before the main force of the Gui army entered Hunan, and quickly resolve the Tang Shengming and Yan Renyi units. He also ordered the newly appointed Commander of the 16th Division, Peng Weiren, to immediately inspect and direct the defense plan in Baoqing and Qiyang. Duan Heng, upon receiving the order, mobilized more than five regiments on the 28th, dividing them into three routes to attack Yongzhou. (1) The Xiangnan Garrison Commander, commanding the two regiments of Chen Hanxiong and Yu Gongqian, attacked Yongzhou from the front via Qiyang. (2) The 46th Brigade Commander of the 16th Division, Zhang Liangji, commanding the regiment of He Jingcheng, attacked the left wing of Yongzhou via Wenmingpu and Huangyangsi. (3) The Commander of the 3rd Column of the Xiangnan Local Defense, Ou Guan, commanding approximately two regiments of local troops, attacked the right wing of Yongzhou via Ningyuan and Daoxian. At dawn on the 29th, the three routes mobilized simultaneously. Tang, Yan, and others had only about 3,000 troops in the Yongqi area. There were only two brief engagements. On the 29th, the Chen regiment of Duan's command engaged the Yan Renyi unit at Daqiao for about two hours. Yan's unit was unable to withstand the pressure and retreated in disarray towards Yongzhou. On the 30th, the He regiment on the left wing engaged the Tang Shengming unit at Lengshuitan. While they were locked in a stalemate, the Ou Guan unit on the right wing had already occupied Yongzhou's Chaizi Temple. Tang's unit collapsed without a fight and also retreated into Yongzhou city. Thereupon, Duan, Zhang, and Ou's three routes all reached the vicinity of Yongzhou on the evening of the 30th and decided to besiege Yongcheng on the morning of October 1st. At that time, the main force of the Gui army was still in Guilin and Quanzhou and had not yet entered Hunan. Yongzhou only had the Tang, Yan, and other units, who knew they were no match. They abandoned Yongzhou at 10:00 AM on the 1st and retreated towards Quanzhou. Yongzhou was thus recaptured for the second time. The first to enter the city was the Chen Hanxiong regiment directly under Duan Heng's command. Upon receiving the report, Peng Weiren departed from Baoqing on the 2nd and rushed to Yongzhou to direct the suppression and plan the defenses.

<h3>Sun Tongxuan Stationed in Dezhou to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondent: Sun Tongxuan, Commander of the 12th Army, originally stationed in Pingyuan, commanding military affairs north of the Yellow River, arrived in Dezhou on the 2nd to inspect the 59th Brigade of Zhao Xinde under his command and dispatched two regiments of the brigade to Deping to suppress bandits. It is reported that the local bandits there have gathered over two thousand people and are former troops of Gu Zhenzhi of the 1st Army of the 30th Route Army of the former Jin army. Previously, the General Headquarters dispatched Mei Jun, Commander of the Newly Organized 1st Army, to pacify them. After Sun Tongxuan arrived in Dezhou, he telegraphed Han Fuju, advocating that if the bandits did not submit, they should be suppressed immediately. Today, the provincial government received another emergency telegram, stating that the bandits were besieging Deping. However, it is not yet known whether Zhao's brigade had arrived for suppression. Furthermore, the bandit gang of Cui Jiu, which disturbed the Guangrao area, was previously scattered by the troops of Cao Fulin of the 14th Army. Now, with the army crossing the river, the rear defenses could not be adequately maintained. Cui has regrouped his bandit gang and is now approaching the Zhao and Ai villages two or three li from Guangrao. Upon receiving the report, the General Headquarters has telegraphed Qiao Lizhi of the 74th Division of the Army, ordering him to actively suppress the bandits. After receiving the order, Qiao immediately selected two battalions of Chen's brigade from the division and personally led them to suppress the bandits. Furthermore, the Tiebanhui Society was discovered at the Dalinchi Railway Station on the Jiaoji Railway last month, disturbing the local area. After being suppressed by the army, they fled to the Laiwu area on the 27th of last month, and Dalinchi has been cleared. On the 29th of last month, Zhan Shutang, Commander of the 73rd Division, and Lei Taiping, Commander of the Handgun Brigade, jointly suppressed the bandit gang in Jingzhi Town, Anqiu. The bandits were unable to withstand the pressure and dispersed on the same day, fleeing to the Taqiao area in the southern countryside of Jiaoxian, where there are still seven or eight hundred people. Jiaoxian has telegraphed the province for assistance. According to people from Anqiu, the losses from the bandit robbery in Jingzhi Town amounted to over two million yuan, and over a hundred women were abducted.</p>
<p>In addition, bandit leaders Wang Sitai, Gezi, and Kang, along with three or four hundred men, are rampant in the Jiangluo Town area bordering Linqu and Anqiu. The people in the western countryside of Anqiu have gone to Anqiu to request that Zhan Shutang, Commander of the 73rd Division, send troops to suppress the bandits.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Arrest of Bandits in the French Concession of Hankou</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondent: Yang Qi, a platoon leader of the 6th Regiment of the 3rd Training Division, responsible for the Wuhan garrison, mistakenly entered the French Concession on the evening of September 26th at 7:00 PM, with two soldiers, while pursuing Zhao Xiuwen, a bandit sent by He Long. The French Consul Botz deemed this an unauthorized action and protested to the garrison headquarters. The headquarters issued a reply to the French Consul on the 3rd, severely refuting the protest. The French Consul's protest and the garrison headquarters' reply are extracted as follows: French Consul's Protest: "To the esteemed Sir, On the 26th of this month, at 7:00 PM, gunshots occurred on Rue Foch in this concession. At the time, a Chinese military officer, identified as Yang Qi, a platoon leader of the 6th Regiment of the 3rd Training Division, accompanied by two soldiers from the 5th Company, pursued a man named Zhao Xiuwen from the Chinese territory. After seeing him enter the concession, they decided to arrest him only after seeing him enter No. 8, Rue Massenet. Zhao, seeing them ascend the stairs and enter the room, jumped out of the window and escaped. Yang Qi and the soldiers fired their guns at the street from the window. After Zhao returned fire, he fled towards Rue de l'Amitie. The above-mentioned circumstances were recounted by Yang Qi to the Chief Inspector of this Concession Police Department after the incident and were confirmed by a joint inspection of the scene of the incident. However, yesterday, several military officers suddenly went to the police department to inquire about Yang Qi's whereabouts. From this, it is evident that he has not yet returned to camp. Moreover, Dr. He, who lives in Rue Massenet, has not returned home since leaving on the 25th. There are many points of suspicion. However, this Consul protests to your esteemed headquarters regarding the unauthorized actions of the Chinese military officer in this concession. If the military officer was indeed pursuing a bandit, he should have reported it to the police department after entering the concession, making it easy to surround and arrest the bandit and avoid the danger of firing guns in the street and injuring innocent pedestrians. This is respectfully submitted. Botz." Garrison Headquarters' Reply: "In reply to your esteemed office's letter of September 29th regarding the case of Yang Qi, a platoon leader of the 6th Regiment of the 3rd Training Division, firing guns and exchanging fire with the bandit Zhao Xiuwen at No. 8, Rue Massenet, after the latter jumped out of the window while being pursued by Yang and two soldiers, apart from the original text being exempted from full transcription, the last two lines of your letter state, 'This Consul protests to your esteemed headquarters regarding the unauthorized actions of the Chinese military officer in this concession. If the military officer was indeed pursuing a bandit, he should have reported it to the police department after entering the concession, making it easy to surround and arrest the bandit and avoid the danger of firing guns in the street and injuring innocent pedestrians.' According to the report from Zhang Dingming, the regimental commander of the regiment, Yang Qi, the platoon leader of the 5th Company, secretly reported that He Long had recently sent bandits to Wuhan to plot an uprising. Zhao Xiuwen was responsible for military guidance. Yang had previously encountered the bandit once and requested that someone be sent to arrest him as soon as possible to prevent the emergence of chaos. The regimental commander, in order to maintain local security and prevent problems before they arose, sent Yang with two soldiers to Hankou to arrest the bandit secretly. It is reported that on the afternoon of the 26th, Yang caught sight of the bandit on the Chinese street and immediately went forward to arrest him. The bandit, fearing punishment, fled into Rue Massenet in the French Concession. Yang and the soldiers either did not know the regulations of the concession or simply did not have time to distinguish which street belonged to the concession and pursued him in a moment of urgency, firing shots from a distance but failing to hit the bandit, allowing him to escape. As for whether Yang and the soldiers have returned to the company, their whereabouts are unknown. It is difficult to predict whether they have been harmed by the bandits. We are currently sending people out to search for them everywhere. It is true that Yang entered the concession to arrest the bandit without reporting to the police department for assistance, which shows a lack of knowledge of the procedures or a failure to distinguish which street belonged to the concession in a moment of urgency, resulting in an error. This was not intentional. In light of the foregoing, we hereby reply to your esteemed office for your information and request that your esteemed Concession Police Department investigate the whereabouts of Yang and report back. To the French Consulate General in Hankou, Commander Xia Douyin. (October 4th)."</p>
<h3>Provincial Training Department Sends Personnel to Guide the Organization of People's Groups</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondent: The reorganization of people's groups in various counties of this province is currently underway. However, the progress in various places is very slow. Some are unclear about the meaning of the laws and regulations and do not know how to proceed. Others misunderstand the laws and regulations and proceed illegally. Still others do not follow the organizational procedures for people's groups or violate the guidance of the Party. There are also internal factional disputes within groups, which hinder the progress of reorganization. Various complex situations constantly exceed expectations. The Central Government has high expectations for the reorganization of people's groups in Jiangsu Province. The Provincial Training Department, acting on the instructions of the Central Government, observed the actual situation in various places and realized that it would be difficult to achieve success in reorganizing people's groups without sending personnel to various places to provide on-site guidance. Therefore, it immediately formulated measures for the district-by-district guidance and organization of people's groups, roughly dividing the province into five districts based on the old Circuit system, with slight modifications. Counties with convenient transportation and a slight foundation for the organization of people's groups will be guided first and included in the first phase. Counties with obstructed transportation, many bandits, and no rudimentary form of people's groups will be guided later and included in the second phase. Each phase will last one month, and it is estimated that the work can be completed in about two months. The instructors will be selected from among the capable and experienced staff of the Provincial Reorganization Committee and supplemented by two comrades with experience in mass movements from outside the committee. It is reported that they will depart and begin their work around the Double Tenth Festival.</p>

<p>Request to Send Personnel to Resolve the Xuanmiao Temple Screen Wall Issue: Regarding the case of reconstructing the screen wall and three gates of Suzhou's Xuanmiao Temple into a commercial market, the preservationists advocate preserving the historical site and not allowing reconstruction, while the pro-business faction advocates demolishing and rebuilding the stores. Both sides have submitted requests to the ministries, academies, provinces, and departments, and the case has been pending for two months without resolution. The National Goods Relief Association here has also submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating that if the three gates are rebuilt into a commercial market, a national goods commercial market should be established to promote national goods. Yesterday, the ministry approved an order from the Executive Yuan, stating that the demolition of Suzhou's Xuanmiao Temple has been ordered by the National Government to be stopped immediately by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and instructed to hand over the matter to the provincial government for immediate stoppage of the demolition and to the Ministry of the Interior for thorough investigation and appropriate handling.

Since the demolition has been ordered to be stopped, the request of the association to reconstruct the three gates of the temple to establish a national goods store should be discussed. In addition to submitting a reply, we must also comply with the regulations. The Wu County Party Headquarters yesterday specifically submitted a report to the Provincial Party Headquarters, which was forwarded to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government, instructing the various ministries, academies, and departments to send personnel to Suzhou to jointly inspect and discuss the matter with the Party and government agencies in order to seek a final resolution.</p>

<p>Unsuccessful Mediation of a Kerosene Storage Dispute: Ge Zicai, the manager of the Yuanda Company in this county, purchased land outside the East Gate in Yangli Lane to build a kerosene storage tank.

Both sides held extreme positions. Yesterday, the county government convened both parties for reconciliation. Attendees included Yuanda's manager Ge Zicai, residents' representative Sheng Zhuofu, silk factories’ representative Chen Tongfu and over ten others.

At about 10 PM at the end of last month, eight or nine bandits in short clothes and carrying weapons suddenly broke through the door and entered, first driving Luo and his family into a room, guarded by a bandit outside, and then ransacking the upstairs. As a result, over one hundred yuan in silver, three to four hundred yuan in soft jewelry, and several silk clothes drying downstairs were all robbed. Because Luo's residence was remote, no neighbors heard anything when the bandits entered, allowing them to plunder to their heart's content.</p>

<h3>Opinion Paper on Revenue Policy by the Ministry of Finance Gammer and Other Design Committee (3rd continuation)</h3>
<p>The plan for a consumption tax system should first clarify the interrelationship between tariffs and inland taxes, or rejected taxes. Import tariffs should not be increased excessively, causing capital and labor to flow from industries that naturally profit to industries that artificially profit due to higher prices of foreign goods, thereby increasing the prices of domestic goods. This will have an adverse impact on national finances. On one hand, revenue from import tariffs will decrease significantly; on the other hand, artificially raising the price of certain goods through manpower will cause capital and labor to leave the industries they have traditionally engaged in, thereby greatly reducing the productivity and taxpaying ability of these industries. Therefore, when imposing import taxes on imported goods, a corresponding amount of consumption tax should be levied on domestically produced goods of the same kind. Conversely, when imposing a consumption tax on domestically produced goods, a corresponding import tax should be levied on foreign goods of the same kind; otherwise, the influx of foreign goods will inevitably overwhelm domestic products and greatly harm national finances. Therefore, this committee recommends that the match tax and cement tax apply not only to domestic products but also to foreign goods.</p>
<p>Among the various consumption taxes levied in China, the most notable are the tobacco and alcohol taxes. The taxes levied on cigars and cigarettes do not significantly differ from this committee's opinions on commodity taxes. These opinions have been explained in the aforementioned two drafts. Other tobacco taxes should be carefully considered and revised. Although this committee does not have detailed recommendations on this point, it is reasonable to combine all tobacco and alcohol taxes into one tax. License fees should ideally be incorporated into general business licenses or business taxes. However, since these taxes have been delegated to the provinces, the best solution requires more thorough consideration.</p>
<p>Alcohol tax should be levied on both foreign and domestic goods. Import alcohol taxes should be levied according to a certain tax rate, with customs acting as the collecting agency. The tax rate can be slightly higher than the current prevailing rate. For foreign alcohol produced domestically, a corresponding tax should be levied based on the quality of the alcohol. These taxes and native alcohol taxes should be regarded as inland taxes.</p>
<p>Combining the Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau with the Rolled Tobacco Consolidated Tax Office will undoubtedly improve the efficiency of tobacco and alcohol tax administration and save administrative costs.</p>
<p>Administrative Organization: This committee has discussed inland tax administration in other reports. What should be reiterated here is that the tax administration of all inland taxes other than salt tax should be consolidated under one office or bureau.</p>
<p>Salt tax is the oldest source of revenue in China, but due to political instability in recent years, its administrative problems differ from those of other taxes. Therefore, the aforementioned plan to consolidate inland taxes under one agency should exclude the Salt Inspectorate. However, this committee's rationale for the draft of the special consumption tax law on matches, submitted on September 6, 1929, strongly advocates for the establishment of a unified agency, called a bureau, office, or agency (the name is irrelevant), directly under the Minister of Finance, to administer all other new and old inland taxes, including the following: rolled tobacco consolidated tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, stamp tax, and special consumption taxes, including the match tax and cement tax recommended by this committee.</p>
<p>The system of various ministries and agencies of the central government independently levying taxes should also be studied. Currently, many agencies outside the Ministry of Finance freely levy taxes under the guise of inspection fees or other names. Although government agencies collecting public fees for their duties should not be considered a loss of natural tax revenue administration, without a single agency handling it, confusion and duplication are inevitable.</p>
<p>This committee has suggested in other drafts that the administration and collection of taxes should be separated and handled by two separate agencies. Strictly supervise the collection of taxes, and all tax revenues should be deposited in the name of the national treasury. If this method can be implemented, the previous system of collecting agencies retaining part of the tax revenue to cover collection costs and only remitting the remaining portion to the national treasury can be abolished. All collection costs should be supervised by the central government and paid directly by the national treasury. Furthermore, after the adoption of this method, all contract donation systems will cease to exist because this system can only exist in improper government organizations. The elimination of the above two systems is undoubtedly necessary.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one important issue that urgently needs to be resolved, namely the division of revenue sources between the central government and local governments. The recommendations for the standards for dividing central tax revenue and local tax revenue (revised based on the recommendations of the National Economic Conference) seem to provide a satisfactory solution to this problem, but the solution should first revise the current tax laws and regulations and reorganize the administrative scope of the central and local governments regarding tax revenue, allowing each to handle its financial resources within its legal scope. This issue is of course related to politics. In short, the division of tax administrative scope is a prerequisite for effective tax administration, and the funds obtained from taxation should be allocated by the central government to local governments level by level, rather than by local governments to the central government. Otherwise, the survival of the central government will depend solely on local governments. (End)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Clarifies Membership Qualifications of Educational Associations</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a report from the Anhui Education Department regarding a telegram from the Lai'an County Education Association requesting clarification of membership qualifications, stated that educational associations are social education organizations. The current committee members and staff who have qualifications of a middle school graduate, if they meet the qualifications in Article 6, Section 1, Paragraph 2 of the Education Association Regulations during the next election, can they be listed as de facto members? The Ministry requests clarification and instructions. The Department states that clarifying legal provisions is not within the Department's jurisdiction, so they are submitting the report for review and clarification. The Ministry recently instructed the Department to reply, stating that Article 6, Section 1, Paragraph 2 of the Education Association Regulations refers to public social education organizations such as public libraries and popular schools that actually implement social education. Educational associations themselves are educational research groups and not educational implementation organizations. Their current committee members and staff cannot obtain the qualifications of de facto members based on the provisions of this article. This should be noted and conveyed for notification.</p>

<h3>City Boy Scout Council Election Meeting</h3>
<p>｜Eight Directors Elected｜Scheduled Swearing-In Ceremony</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Boy Scout Council held its election meeting yesterday, convened by the Training Department of the City Party Headquarters at the City Party Headquarters. Many service members, representatives from the City Executive Committee, and representatives from the China Boy Scout Headquarters, totaling over a hundred people, attended. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Tong Xingbai, the Training Minister of the City, and the proceedings were as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Address: Gentlemen, today we are electing members to the City Boy Scout Council. A total of forty-six people have arrived, and there are ninety-four qualified service members in total. Apart from the five who have asked for leave, there are still eighty-five. The number of people who have arrived today, forty-six, is more than half, so we can officially start the meeting. We know that the Boy Scout cause is both a national and a social cause because Boy Scouts are the nation's most outstanding young citizens and also the fundamental elements in improving society. Therefore, the Boy Scout cause is more important than ordinary national and social causes, and the training of Boy Scouts must be given special attention. During the era of warlord governments, the Boy Scout cause relied on the enthusiasm and efforts of individuals to barely maintain itself. The government paid no attention to it, so the various aspects of the Boy Scouts were very disorganized. Now that our Party is in power, all facilities are based on the Three Principles of the People as the guiding principle of education. The same is true for Boy Scouts. We must ensure that Boy Scout education does not deviate from the educational policy under Party rule and that the Boy Scout cause becomes a truly national and social education center. Shanghai is the most important region in the country. No matter what organization, it needs a central organization to function properly. The same is true for Boy Scouts. If there is no central organization, it is no different from a soulless body. If we want future development, that is just a dream. Therefore, the establishment of the Council is tantamount to creating a new life for the Shanghai Boy Scout cause. Now, with the enthusiastic hope of the Party and the government, and with the sincere request of the Boy Scouts in our city, the Shanghai Council has been successfully established. I believe that after the birth of this group that is tied to a new life, all facilities and all plans can proceed in an orderly and gradual manner. The future development will be forward, and the future of the Shanghai Boy Scout cause will be bright and limitless. I hope that in the future, the members of our city can be more united and consistent, sacrifice personal opinions, and seek a concrete expression of love and sincerity. Finally, I also hope that the future Council will pay attention to (1) the issue of rectifying discipline. We know that discipline is the lifeblood of a group. Without discipline, this group will be scattered. Boy Scouts have the important responsibility of strengthening the nation and transforming society, so they should strictly abide by discipline. (2) Fully develop the spirit of Boy Scouts. The spirit of Boy Scouts is not about the beauty of the style or the spirit of the uniform, but about being able to consistently express the spirit of Boy Scouts in all aspects of work and to promote the virtue of selflessness at all times and in all places, as a model for society and a role model for young people. I deeply hope that you can understand these points and put them into practice.</p>
<p>Preparatory Process: Mr. Zhu Jiarang reported on the preparatory process of the Council, saying that in the past few years, Shanghai Boy Scouts have been very disorganized due to the lack of guiding principles for education. Since our Party came to power, it has greatly reformed the old and bad places, and the same is true for Boy Scouts. Therefore, under the leadership of our Party, the Boy Scout cause is changing and improving day by day. Therefore, the original Boy Scout guidance organizations in Shanghai, such as the Promotion Association, etc., must also be changed. The central government has had many plans and new facilities for the Boy Scout cause. The City Party Headquarters has also followed the instructions of the central government and has had considerable influence. The establishment of the Council today is the result of our influence. The City Party Headquarters has been preparing for the City Council for three months. During this period, because the headquarters has not yet fully established a unified guidance organization, for example, after the proposal of a division-level organization, it was renamed the Council, and at the same time, various regulations have not been promulgated, so it was once suspended during the summer vacation, which is why it has been delayed until now and the City Council has not been established. The first difficulty in establishing the Council is the issue of funding. If there is no funding, it will be difficult to do things. The Director of the City Education Bureau is a natural reason. We contacted him to request a monthly subsidy of 200 yuan, which was finally resolved satisfactorily. This problem has been broken. The second is the issue of the venue. The conditions we require for the venue are: first, the location should be good, second, it should not cost money, and third, the transportation should be convenient. This is very difficult. At first, we wanted to attach it to the City Chamber of Commerce, but because the City Chamber of Commerce has too many affiliated organizations, it was changed to a district party headquarters. However, the transportation of a district party headquarters is inconvenient, but it is better than nothing until we find a suitable place.</p>
<p>Representative's Address: The representative of the China Boy Scout Headquarters said, "Chairman Zhu and Comrade have already reported in detail. I am just here to state a few important hopes of the central government for the Shanghai Council. The Shanghai City Training Department has painstakingly prepared for the establishment of the Council. How should we work hard? How should we think about the future of the Shanghai Boy Scouts so as not to fail their hard work? The organization of the China Boy Scouts is divided into four levels: the national and city/county councils, the provincial council, and the central headquarters. Because the Council has not been established, many barriers have arisen between the central government and the groups. This is because the spatial distance is too far, so the situation is unclear. With the organization of the Council, it will help the headquarters and naturally provide many conveniences to the groups. Therefore, the establishment of the Council is very important. After the establishment of the Council, there will be many conveniences in terms of the organization and assessment of the Boy Scouts. How? Because the central government often cannot take care of the talents of the group leaders, there are often shortcomings. With the organization of the Council, this problem can be easily solved. I hope that after the establishment of the Shanghai Council, we will do our best to do the above things."</p>
<p>Election Results: The winners were Shen Yu, Qu Yue, Wang Gang, Huang Xian, Zhang Xunfang (above are the official directors), Gu Meilai, Zhao Weizu, Wang Wenhua (above are the alternate directors). It is said that the above new directors will be reported to the headquarters for approval by the supervisors and the City Training Department today. The date of the swearing-in ceremony is around the Double Tenth Festival.</p>
<p>Councilors' Talk: After the meeting, the new directors were called together for a talk by Mr. Luo Qiu, the representative of the Boy Scout Headquarters. The City Training Department provided refreshments. Mr. Luo gave detailed instructions on the future direction of the Council.</p>
<h3>Swearing-In Ceremony for New School Principals in the City</h3>
<p>The new principals of Shanghai Municipal Schools held a supplementary swearing-in ceremony at the City Education Bureau at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. A total of thirty-eight new principals arrived. At 2:00 p.m., the bell rang to start the meeting, and the ceremony was held as scheduled. First, Director Chen of the Bureau gave a report, the main idea being that the oath is important for educators, and the government stipulates that principals should also take an oath for the sake of wholeheartedly striving for the education of the Three Principles of the People. In the future, all teachers and staff in the school will also take an oath to show solemnity. People who take the oath should remember each word of the oath in their hearts and express each word. Next, Comrade Huang Zaoque, the representative of the City Party Headquarters, gave a speech, the main idea being that the power of education can change the people. Our country takes the Three Principles of the People as the center of education, and the only way to save China is to work hard on the education of the Three Principles of the People. This is the important responsibility of all principals. The representative of the mayor gave a speech, further explaining the meaning of the oath and encouraging the new principals to work hard in their positions and not engage in corruption. Later, Mr. Xiong Wenmin, on behalf of the new principals, gave a reply. The ceremony ended at about 4:00 p.m.</p>

<h3>Grass Tennis Singles A Record</h3>
<p>Mr. Hyoro Wins the Championship</p>
<p>｜Qiu Feihai Loses Unluckily Three to One｜</p>
<p>Excellent Ball Skills. Mr. Hyoro, the 1925 All-Japan Singles Champion, defeated our country's Qiu Feihai by a score of three to one and won the Shanghai Grass Tennis Singles Championship. Mr. Hyoro was already leading by two to one the day before, but the game was suspended due to darkness. Yesterday afternoon, the two continued to compete at the French Concession General Assembly. Mr. Hyoro won the fourth set again with six to four, and the victory was completed. The Singles Certificate Championship this year belongs to him. After the game, Mr. White, the president of the Grass Tennis Association, gave a speech and invited Mrs. Donner to give the award and then dispersed.</p>
<h3>Qiu Feihai Full of Vigor</h3>
<p>The bell rang three times, and the war began. Qiu Feihai was full of vigor and tried to make progress, frequently shooting backhand shots at the opponent, which was quite dominant. He also used the method of feinting to score points many times and won the first game of the fourth set. The second game was wonderful for both of them. A point must be obtained after a lot of hard work and countless struggles, and the difficulty can be imagined. Qiu made great progress in this game, his shots were agile, and his attack was effective. He finally won the game with ten to eight. In the third game, Mr. Hyoro's anger rose, and there were frequent discoveries of touching the net and wild balls. Qiu Feihai was calm and composed and won the third game again. The momentum at that time made it easy to defeat the fourth set and fight Mr. Hyoro to the end.</p>
<h3>Mr. Hyoro Wins the Championship After Hard Fighting</h3>
<p>However, Mr. Hyoro has been in the battlefield for a long time and has rich experience. Under this difficult situation, he can still act cautiously, which is commendable. He used Qiu's weak serve and suddenly launched a smash, causing Qiu to not be able to look back in time. Because of this, he regained two games, and then used his own serve to gain momentum and won two more games. After twenty minutes, he heard the changes of vicissitudes. It turned out that Mr. Hyoro had already taken the lead and had a score of four to three, and became a trend of turning defeat into victory. Qiu made a great effort to whip, left draw and right hit, and also fought back a game, making the score four to four. In the last two games, the God of Happiness abandoned Qiu and went to Mr. Hyoro, so soon Mr. Hyoro won consecutive victories and won the fourth set with six to four.</p>

<h3>Chinese Men's and Women's Singles Championship</h3>
<p>Male... Guo Qida</p>
<p>Male... Yang Ren</p>
<p>The Shanghai Open Chinese Singles Championship finals were held yesterday. The participants were Guo Qida and Liu Keng in the men's group, and Yang Ren and Yang Bizhen in the women's group. As a result, Guo Qida won the men's group championship, with a score of three to zero. Yang Ren won the women's group championship, with a score of two to zero.</p>
<p>(1) Men's Group... Guo Qida Wins Liu Keng ｜Three to Zero｜</p>
<p>Guo Qida is good at both offense and defense. His victory in the championship was expected by the audience. As a result, he won in straight sets.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the first set, Liu was repeatedly frustrated and lost three games in a row. It was not until the fourth game that he defeated Guo with four to two. He then lost three games in a row. Guo won the first set with six to one.</p>
<p>In the second set, Liu was fierce at the beginning, his smash was wonderful, and he won with four to one. However, time is no more, Guo then went smoothly and won six games in a row, and became six to one again.</p>
<p>In the third set, Guo still won with six to one. Only in the sixth game, Liu was greatly attacked and ate a slippery four. Liu's performance in that game was very good. In summary, in the three sets, Guo Qida made a uniform color, all with a score of six to one, which is extremely wonderful.</p>
<p>(2) Women's Group... Yang Ren Wins Yang Bizhen</p>
<p>｜Two to Zero｜</p>
<p>Both ladies did not work hard for the qualification for the finals because the other side waived the right in the previous preliminary round, which was cheaper for them. The finals were held yesterday to determine who would win the championship. Both sides have quite strong skills, but Miss Yang Ren's serve is better, and she is willing to work hard to save the ball. Miss Bizhen is not like that. If the opponent's ball is slightly difficult, she will stare blankly and not move her lotus steps easily. The reason for her failure is mostly here. However, sometimes Miss Yang Ren makes some mistakes and often commits suicide. As a result, Miss Yang Ren won the championship with two to zero.</p>
<p>In the first set, a total of ten games were fought in this set. Yang Ren won the first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth, and tenth games, a total of six games. Miss Bizhen won the third, seventh, eighth, and ninth games, a total of four games. Yang Ren won with a score of six to four.</p>
<p>In the second set, Yang Ren won the first, second, third, fifth, sixth, and seventh games, a total of six games. The remaining fourth and eighth games were won by Miss Bizhen. As a result, Miss Yang Ren still won the second set with six to one, and won the women's group championship.</p>

At this time, he sent a long pass, Mei Hongbao flew forward and headed the ball into the goal. Soon after, Chen Jiaqiu got the help of Chen Chengxiang and also grabbed a goal. Chen Houfu and He Xuan also showed their skills and broke the dragon gate. In the first half, Jinan four, St. Francis one.</p>
<p>Second half: In the sound of the restart, St. Francis took a breath and launched a large-scale invasion. The right wing Su Shi played successfully and scored a goal.

Ten minutes later, Zhang Rongwen scored a goal first, and Dai Linjing added two more goals. Chen Bingxiang desperately got a goal. In the second half, Jinan took the lead again with four to one, and as a result, won with eight to two.</p>

<h3>One Word of Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Holding Buddha</p>
<p>Life is like playing cards. Getting good cards is like being born into a wealthy family. Getting bad cards is like being a poor child. Building a family from scratch is like exhausting your efforts. Maybe you can win a big hand, but it is very difficult. It's like someone can give you a card to eat. This is like someone promoting you, so you won't lose money. If your card style is bad and the upper family is desperately trying to nail you, this is like kicking someone when they are down. It's very similar. Like a nouveau riche family, rich people who make money improperly, this is very similar to winning a big hand with active hands.</p>
<p>The human body is the same as heaven and earth. Heaven wants it to be clear and light, and earth wants it to be heavy and turbid. People do not know the way to maintain health. Thinking hurts the brain, and lust hurts the kidneys. The head is not clear, light, heavy, and turbid. The abdomen is not heavy, turbid, clear, and light. The top is heavy and the bottom is light. The center of gravity is lost. As a result, diseases such as headache, dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus, asthma, kidney deficiency, and nocturnal emission occur. Therefore, the horse stance of martial artists and the dantian breathing of meditators are all paying attention to the way of the top being clear and light and the bottom being heavy and turbid.</p>
<p>Life is thorough. The appearance is empty. It's a pity that many people can't see through it and can't figure it out. Why bother with a narrow mind, arrogant intentions, vanity, and snobbery to build a fence at the bottom of the sea? In my opinion, reading is the most enjoyable and doing good is the most enjoyable.</p>
<p>When people reach middle age, joy is faint. As Wang Dun'gen said, "Even if you play cards with a 10,000-yuan stake today and win a big victory, it is not as fun as playing money sparrow with my late father when I was a child." Alas, the years cannot flow backwards, and if you don't establish a career in this world, how can you not follow Dong E's sigh?</p>
<h3>A Brief Note on Fan Diwen's Speech</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>Former Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Second International, Mr. Fan Diwen, was invited by the Academia Sinica to give a speech in China. He first went to Beiping and Shenyang, and then toured Beijing and Hangzhou. Due to the urgent time, he stayed in Shanghai for only two or three days. Jiaotong University in this city believed that Mr. Fan was the old friend of the Premier and was very clear about the political situation in China, so it specially invited him to the school. Mr. Meng kindly agreed and gave a speech in the Wen Zhi Hall of the school one afternoon. There were no less than a thousand listeners. Among the guests were Mr. Cai Jiemin, the president of the Academia Sinica, and many Westerners. Here are some miscellaneous notes to send to this talk.</p>
<p>Mr. Fan's Appearance: At four o'clock, Mr. Fan and other dignitaries took their seats. Mr. Fan is nearly sixty years old. He has a lot of beard and wears glasses on his nose. His appearance is extraordinary and his spirit is especially bright. First, Li Zhaohuan, the vice minister of the Ministry of Railways and the president of the school, gave a welcome speech, saying that the relationship between China and Belgium is very deep. Mr. Fan advocates national self-determination and world peace, which is especially desired by the Chinese people. Then he translated it into English.</p>
<p>Speaking Entirely in French: Then Mr. Fan gave a speech. At first, I thought it would be in English, but from beginning to end, it was entirely in French. Few people in the audience are proficient in this way, so they can only speculate on its intentions based on its posture. The person standing next to Mr. Li was his full-time translator. Although Mr. Fan's words were incomprehensible, his tone and posture are worthy of being a great orator. At the climax, the voice was like a Hong Zhong, shaking the house. It is not easy for an old man of seventy to be so energetic.</p>
<p>Adhering to the Three Principles of the People: Mr. Fan would translate each paragraph of his speech through a translator. At first, he expressed his views on the Premier's Three Principles of the People, expressing his admiration and adherence, and that it was suitable for modern needs. It is not easy for Mr. Fan to understand the Three Principles of the People so clearly and have a deep understanding of them. The translator's eloquence is excellent. It took several hours, so the listeners were not tired at all.</p>
<p>Excellent Words in the World: He criticized communism a lot, saying that those people only use violence to hold the world, regardless of the situation in various places. For example, a woman is pregnant and should wait for her to mature and give birth, so that her children can be healthy. Now, she does not consider this and forces her to give birth artificially in five or six months. How can the result be perfect? The world has not reached the communist era, and forcibly making it red is like this. For a time, the listeners were in an uproar.</p>
<p>Sudden Questions: After Mr. Fan finished his speech, a man in the crowd stood up and asked three questions, saying that Belgium has not yet abandoned extraterritoriality, the British Labor Party's policy does not conform to the theory of the Second International, and Belgians have set up settlements in China, etc. The audience was stunned by his eloquent words. At that time, the chairman believed that the questions were reasonable, so he asked the translator to ask Mr. Fan. Mr. Fan used his attitude of responding to questions in the parliament in the past to calmly answer. It took almost half a sentence, and the meeting was dismissed in cheers.</p>
<h3>Machine Gun Cures Tai</h3>
<p>— Good Citizen</p>
<p>Who is Machine Gun? Everyone knows it's the nickname of Mr. Yuan Xiluo Chushu, a native of Baoshan, Suzhou. Mr. Yuan is the third child in his family. His eldest brother, Guanlan, was respected for his virtue and conduct. Recently, he passed away in Shanghai due to a minor illness. The sage has withered, and the whole country mourns him. Mr. Chushu has always been known for his uprightness and outspokenness, which was feared by those in power at the time, hence the nickname "Machine Gun." Those who don't know him are initially intimidated by his name, thinking he is sharp and unapproachable. However, upon meeting him, he is found to be kind and approachable. Mr. Yuan is indeed a man who is internally firm but externally humble. He has been a member of the Kuomintang for a long time and was a member of the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) in the past. His arguments moved the world, and he was known as a revolutionary activist. Due to his quiet and retiring nature, he preferred not to engage in political maneuvering, seeking temporary fame. After the revolution, he devoted himself to education, serving as the principal of Nanjing Middle School, Suzhou Middle School, and Tongji University Affiliated Middle School for more than ten years. His students are spread all over Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In the spring of the 18th year, he moved from Qidong to Taicang as an official. His integrity and uprightness brought a new perspective to the people of Taicang. He made a small attempt with great success, and after only fourteen months, he left his post. His achievements were remarkable and praised by the people. Mr. Yuan valued emotions. During his tenure, he often gave extremely poignant speeches at commemorative gatherings, gesticulating passionately. The listeners were moved. He said that the thing he hated most in his life was the spread of opium. On the day he took office, he told people that he would do his best to eradicate opium as long as he was in Taicang. Later, he was ordered to set up an opium suppression bureau, accepting reports and taking swift action, not avoiding suspicion or resentment. Although he was hated by a few local gentry because of this, he did not care. A certain policeman had been dismissed for smoking opium. This policeman, who had previously abused his power, was not only dismissed but also engaged in selling opium at home. The clerks and servants in the government colluded with each other and were arrogant. Mr. Yuan found out about this and took the opportunity to arrest him during an inspection tour. He was eventually brought to justice. As a result, corrupt officials restrained themselves. He also arrested a rogue lawyer named Xu, which pleased the entire county. Initially, a relative of Xu was a prominent local figure and had a past connection with Mr. Yuan. When Xu was arrested, someone asked Mr. Yuan what he would do if the gentry came to plead for leniency. Mr. Yuan said that he would still handle the case according to the law because public and private matters should be kept separate, and a wise gentry would understand this. Even if he came, he would not be able to comply. The gentry heard this and did not say a word. However, Mr. Yuan was eventually blamed by the gentry for this. Mr. Yuan lived frugally while in office, always walking instead of using a car. He especially valued agriculture. Whenever there were locust plagues or insect pests, he would personally go to the countryside to inspect the fields and instruct the villagers on how to prevent and catch them. He spoke to them like a father to his sons. He also frequently gathered the villagers to give simple and sincere speeches. Everyone was surprised that they had never seen such an official in their decades of life. His actions were like this. He was fond of leisure and enjoyed flowers and trees. The office had a garden that had been abandoned. After Mr. Yuan arrived, he pruned, arranged, and planted the plants, making it orderly and neat. In his spare time, he would chant poems in the garden for enjoyment. He was good at calligraphy, and those who sought his work came one after another, and he never refused. Later, due to financial constraints and various restrictions, he repeatedly visited his superiors to present plans and strategies, hoping to make some progress. However, his proposals were not adopted. Mr. Yuan did not want to be a useless official, so he resolutely resigned and returned home. He expressed his aspirations in a poem: "Ashamed of having achieved nothing in my year of office, I am troubled by seeking pasture for the people. Everyone laughs at my simplicity in upholding integrity, and can the defense against enemies ever be enough? Fortunately, locusts and insects are no longer seen, but I still feel guilty that the bridge and road have not been completed. Today, I resign and return home, but I don't have an old house like Yuanming." This shows Mr. Yuan's character. On the day of his departure, the people lined the road, sighing that he was a virtuous official. (Refusing Rewards)</p>
<h3>Various Aspects of Cheng Yanqiu</h3>
<p>— Xingqiu</p>
<p>"Wenji Returns to Han" is Cheng Yanqiu's creation. The story is based on the story of Cai Wenji returning to the Han Dynasty. Although the plot is simple, the production scale is very grand. The lyrics of Wenji's songs in the play are elegant and refined, and the costumes are novel, which is a new approach. The scenes of drinking in the palace and worshiping at Zhao Jun's tomb are both gorgeous and elegant. The ceremonial guards during Wenji's return to Han used the old style, purely imitating ancient times. The singing is complex, with both Xipi and Erhuang tunes. In addition to Yuanban, Kuaiban, and Nanbangzi, there are also three major sections of slow Xipi, Zheng Erhuang, and Fan Tiao. The essence of the singing lies in the original tune of the Eighteen Songs of the Tartar Reed Pipe, which is the most commendable. The lyrics contain sentences with seven or eight characters, and each sentence has the word "兮" (xi). When Yao Qing taught Yanqiu, he created the tunes according to the words. The "兮" in each sentence must be sung immediately after the lyrics without waiting for the erhu interlude, which is very different from the usual Erhuang singing method. Zhen Hui's poem, "Qiu Lang's laughter and tears are wonderful for a woman, and ten thousand people are captivated by the red carpet," is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>The Sino-French University of the World Academy held a meeting at 6 pm on October 2 to welcome Yanqiu and played ancient music to help the atmosphere. Dr. Zheng Yuxiu organized a costume ball to raise funds for the Liaoxi flood disaster, which is scheduled to be held at the Grand Hotel next week. It is said that Yanqiu will be asked to perform more songs and dances. Yanqiu is chivalrous and righteous and is willing to help raise funds for disaster relief, so we must rely on him.</p>
<p>Someone named Tidao presented Yanqiu with a couplet: "Her teeth and tongue emit jade-like and golden sounds, beautiful and charming," and "Her liver and gallbladder shine like frost and moonlight, clear as autumn." The first line praises her art, and the second line praises her character, which is a good match.</p>
<p>Short News: The old actor Li Chunli is a famous Jing (painted-face male) actor in Shanghai, affiliated with the Samsung Stage. He is naturally kind and benevolent. When poor people ask for his help, he always generously gives. Therefore, people in the opera world praise him. Recently, he was saddened by the devastation of the floods in Northeast China and automatically donated 50 yuan. It is commendable that an ordinary actor can be so courageous in doing good.

<p>Letter: To the Editor of the Free Talk section of your esteemed newspaper: Yesterday, your Free Talk section published an article by Mr. Yu Yangzhou, recording two strange events related to me. The so-called strange deeds of mine are not factual. It is true that I study Buddhism, but the things like commanding ghosts and gods, and summoning centipedes are close to witchcraft, which is beyond my ability. Moreover, my sister-in-law does not understand incantations at all. It is even more shocking to hear your newspaper say that my sister-in-law can use incantations to treat illnesses for relatives. I urge you to make corrections. Sincerely, Yuan Xilian</p>
<h3>The Biography of Mr. Zhao Tieqiao (3)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Guangzu</p>
<p>The party members were unsuccessful in eastern and southern Sichuan, so they moved to western Sichuan and launched a large-scale attack on Chengdu. My father went to Longchang again. The Chengdu affair failed again. Two uncles, Lusheng and Xinyou, and Mr. Zhang Zhixiang and six others were imprisoned, known as the Six Gentlemen. Mr. Cheng Defan died while fleeing to Jiading. Those who fled to Yibin and Pingshan also died. Zhao Erfeng, the governor of Qingchuan, ordered the arrest of the remaining party members. My father fled back to Shuren School. The principal asked two students to escort my father east to Zhongzhou. After a year, when the arrest was slightly relaxed, he returned to Shuren School to graduate. He went west to Chengdu to visit the Six Gentlemen, who were imprisoned in the Chengdu Prefecture Prison and the Chengdu Huayang County Prison. My father bribed the prison guards to get in and out, secretly communicating with the Six Gentlemen and the party members. The Guang'an affair failed again. Mr. Jinfan was seriously injured and came [to Chengdu]. The Qing officials closed the city and searched, and he could not get out. My father hid in the Chengdu County Prison and drank with his uncle Xinyou for seven days before leaving. The party members rose and fell repeatedly, and their momentum was not strong. They went to Sichuan together. My father believed that the party members had action but no propaganda, so they were easily defeated. He created the "Entertainment News" to promote the revolution through literature and art. Uncle Lusheng was in charge of writing in prison, and my father was in charge of issuing it outside. As a result, his reputation gradually grew. Qing officials vaguely heard that Hu Yubin, who robbed Jiang'an, was Zhao's alias and published an order to arrest him.</p>
<p>Two years before the founding of the Republic of China, my father went to Beijing to seek the release of the Six Gentlemen. Mr. Wang Jingwei and Mr. Huang Fusheng were imprisoned for plotting to assassinate the Qing Prince Regent. Many party members in Beijing fled into hiding. My father arrived and set up an organization on Yanwang Temple Street, summoning those who had fled into hiding. They left Nanxiawa and met at Taoran Pavilion to secretly plan things. From then on, this became a routine. He and Mr. Tian Ziqin created the "Guoguang News" to criticize the Qing court for its loss of virtue, implicitly leading the revolution in northern China.</p>
<p>To save the Six Gentlemen, my father consulted with Sichuan officials in Beijing, but they refused. He conspired with Ms. Chen Bijun to rob the Ministry of Law prison to rescue Wang Jingwei and Huang Fusheng, but it did not succeed. He once studied ancient Chinese literature with Imperial Censor Zhao Gengyaosheng. Whenever he asked about party affairs, my father would always shed tears. Zhao Gong asked the Qing court to lift the ban on political parties, but all three memorials were rejected. More than 20 days after the Wuchang Uprising, the Qing court lifted the ban on political parties, and Wang Jingwei and Huang Fusheng were released from prison. More than 20 days later, Chengdu was captured, and the Six Gentlemen were released from prison.</p>
<p>Initially, my father secretly went to Wu Luzhen's army, scheduled to seize Shijiazhuang on September 17 to cut off the Qing army's retreat from Wuhan. He and Zhang Shaozeng's army from Luanzhou would attack Beijing together. On the appointed day, my father and Wang Jingwei went to Shijiazhuang together. On the way, they heard that Wu Luzhen had died. They turned to Tianjin and entered Luanzhou to ask Commander Zhang. However, the day before, Zhang's associate commander, Pan Juying, had received orders from the Qing court to take over Zhang's army. My father and Wang Jingwei pretended to be sent by the Qing Consultative Council to advise Zhang not to lightly discuss state affairs and rushed back to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (288)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Green Bamboo Tears, Her Heart Broken; Red Lotus Scent Fades, a Maiden's Soul Departs</p>
<p>The old man from Ningbo's various methods were originally intended to drive away Cuijun. But in this environment, Cuijun only had two paths: death or escape. A famous scholar once said that marrying a concubine who is not content in her place is like capturing a kingfisher and raising it in a cage. But the kingfisher does not submit to the cage. In the end, there are only two options: either lock it to death in the cage or open the cage and let it fly away. Now Cuijun is a kingfisher. If she is not released, she will die in their house, costing them another coffin. So, in the end, Zhang Yiqing saw that she had become a medicine jar. Fortunately, he had other favorites and did not need Cuijun. Keeping her at home would only be a source of annoyance. The old man from Ningbo sometimes quarreled with Zhang Yiqing and used Cuijun as an excuse. If Cuijun took her own life out of anger, it would be another drowning. Moreover, the old man from Ningbo intended to drive her out. Therefore, Zhang Yiqing adopted the "open the cage and release the bird" approach and let Cuijun leave. He still showed some consideration for their past relationship and let her take her clothes and jewelry. He also gave her 300 yuan. This relationship was considered over. This is the beginning and end of Cuijun's return to the world. Zuo Shicheng met Cuijun again and earnestly advised her that wandering in brothels was not a good thing. She should open her eyes and choose a man. He also knew that she had no choice but to return to the world this time. But after this experience, she would gain some knowledge and experience. Cuijun sighed and said, "Call you a good Second Young Master. We girls in the brothel have already been molded into the shape of a concubine. If people want to marry a formal wife, they will never come to our brothel. As for people from the lower class, we won't marry them. Last time, when I married that Mr. Zhang, although I was young and inexperienced, I wasn't reckless. You see, Mr. Zhang had a wife, but she lived in the countryside and didn't come to Shanghai. I asked many of his friends, and they all said the same thing. In Shanghai, many businessmen are like him, especially people from Ningbo and Shaoxing. I didn't expect him to have an old lover who was the wife of a friend. Although it was an affair, she had such power. The worst thing was that I shouldn't have moved into their house. If I had lived outside, I don't think it would have come to this. Secondly, I am too honest by nature and think everyone is a good person. When I first went in, I thought it was normal for men to have two or three wives. Everyone could live together in harmony. She and Mr. Zhang had a long history. I heard that she had helped him financially in the past. Now, if I am a little humble, it doesn't matter. Even if I roll cigarettes for her, it's okay."</p>

<h3>Review of Last Week's Treasury Bill Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Initially Showing Promise... Then Weakening... Slight Rise at the End of the Week... Fluctuations Reached as High as 25.8 Taels Last week's Treasury bill market continued its upward trend, but fluctuations were uncertain and precarious. The front end was strong, but the back end was weak, with daily fluctuations exceeding ten taels. It once broke through the 570 tael mark, mainly due to repeated declines in overseas silver markets and exchange rates. At the beginning of the week, large traders covered short positions, and on Tuesday (September 30), the price suddenly reached 577.6 taels. However, on Monday (September 29), the initial morning price was only 551.8 taels. Later, rumors spread that the United States was planning to rescue the silver market and that the Bank of England was planning to propose gold coins to prevent banks from falling further. In particular, speculators such as Indian merchant Qiao Rifu and Wu Mou tended to sell, and some short sellers increased their positions, so the market sentiment weakened, and the price fell sharply, plummeting by more than ten taels to just over 60 taels. By the end of the week, the market slightly improved, and the result was 564.4 taels, an increase of 11.5 taels compared to the previous Saturday. The difference between the high and low prices during the week was 25.8 taels, but market sentiment was erratic, with both long and short positions exerting mutual restraint. The recent total amount was approximately 50,000 taels. The British silver bar fell by 0.125, but there was a return of 0.375 during the week. The US bank price also fluctuated by 0.01, a total decrease of 0.005, while the HSBC listed shilling fell by half a pence. The Japanese exchange rate rose by 0.3333. At the initial settlement price, the spot red bar was initially more than 20 taels higher than the forward price, then increased by 15 taels. However, the trend was normal. The following is a summary of the week's events.</p>
<p>Frequent News of Silver Price Support, Finally Continuing the Upward Trend Since the big bar was unchanged on Monday, the silver price continued to fall, and the initial listing of the shilling was unchanged, then reduced by half a file. The internal market tightened, and Chinese merchants generally sold. As for the November treasury bill, the initial price was 552.5 taels, followed by 1.8 taels. Later, large traders such as Xinhong and Luo Mou covered short positions, so the price increased by ten taels, reaching 561.8 taels, and the market closed at 560 taels. The total return for the day was ten taels. The next day, Xinhong, Taikangrun, and others抵空, while the Dalian gang Yuan Maoyong and others tended to sell, and the price suddenly soared to 570 taels. In the afternoon, it surged to 577.6 taels, while the silver market continued to decline. The shilling market fell by a total of two files before and after, totaling half a pence. The internal market also tightened, and colleagues rushed to close positions. However, the gold market fell to 572 taels. However, the total return for the market was 15.8 taels, and the rise was explosive. October 1 (Wednesday) was a holiday for the Mid-Autumn Festival, and there was no market, but the silver market rebounded, and the bank was still open as usual. The shilling internal and external markets were still stable, and there were slight sales in the gold industry. On Thursday, both the big bar and the foreign exchange market were unchanged, but the bank foreign exchange market tended to be loose. Although there were hedging activities in the gold industry, the bank's intention to sell was still strong. The treasury bill initially fell by 1.8 taels due to the American saying that there was support for the big bar silver, totaling 567.04 taels. Later, there seemed to be more buyers, so it added more than three taels. Later, Yu Da of the Dalian gang, and others sold it, and the price plummeted by six taels. Afterwards, it hovered around 570 taels, and speculators had different opinions on acceptance and delivery. The next day, the big bar rose slightly, and the foreign exchange market also rose by half. The internal market was also loose, but colleagues were still buying, and the gold market trend was weakening and had retreated to within 565 taels. The day saw a return of 11.1 taels, and the result continued to fall by 4.7 taels, a total decrease of about 9 taels over two days, which was due to the news that the UK was proposing to save the silver price spreading in the market, and people were terrified. The big bar and silver market both rose on Saturday, but the United States tended to sell, and people were still in good spirits, so the gold market trend was firm. However, trading was not strong because the 5th (Sunday) and 6th were bank holidays, so it was closed for two consecutive days. Therefore, both the long and short sides were balanced, and the price seemed to show an upward trend. The difference between the highest price of 566.8 taels and the lowest price of 563.2 taels in half a day was no more than 3.7 taels. By the close of the market, it was 564.4 taels, 1.1 taels better than the day before, and the red bar also increased by one tael. The following is a list of the high and low prices of the British and American silver markets, exchange rates, treasury bills, etc.</p>

<h3>Securities: Quiet Bond Market Last Week</h3>
<p>Bond Prices Slightly Rebounded, but the Trend Was Very Moderate Last week, the bond market in this port was quiet. Due to the Mid-Autumn Festival, there were only four trading days in the entire week, apart from the closure on Monday for the settlement of September futures and the Mid-Autumn Festival on Wednesday. Daily trading was very sparse, and the atmosphere was usually very quiet. A total of 37,425,000 yuan was opened in April, of which demobilization bonds and repatriation bonds were still good, customs duties and 19-year tobacco bonds were not lonely, and the others were very quiet. Demobilization bonds totaled 8,210,000 yuan in October and 8,335,000 yuan in November. Repatriation bonds totaled 6,160,000 yuan in October and 4,700,005 yuan in November. 19-year tobacco bonds totaled 2,655,000 yuan in October and 1,130,000 yuan in November. Customs duties totaled 2,410,000 yuan in October and 1,500,050 yuan in November. Rehabilitation bonds totaled 940,000 yuan in October and 405,000 yuan in November. 96-minute bonds totaled 350,000 yuan in October and 195,000 yuan in November. 6% bonds totaled 260,000 yuan in October. In November, only 15,000 yuan was traded at the beginning of the week. There were only slightly more transactions in the 7-year bond market in October, totaling 60,000 yuan. 25,000 yuan was traded in the financial bond market, and 5,000 yuan was traded in the continuation bond market, while there was no market at all in the continuation 25 market throughout the week, and the spot market was very sparse. Only 37,500 yuan was traded throughout the week. Speaking of the changes in bond prices during the week, all industries usually have a small settlement before the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the situation is also less changeable. Moreover, the large trading houses were watching during the settlement period, so the market was quiet and the supply and demand situation was balanced. The change in bond prices was much more stable than before. The prices of each bond remained stable without large fluctuations during the weekend. Only on Tuesday and Thursday, bond prices rebounded due to the consistent activities of investors in the market. For example, the demobilization, repatriation, and 19-year tobacco bonds all rose quite sharply. As a result, the demobilization, repatriation, and 19-year tobacco bonds each rose by about 2 yuan compared to the previous week, while the rehabilitation, customs duties, and 6% bonds each rose by about 1 yuan. Although other bonds rose slightly, the amount was very small. The following is a list of the high and low fluctuations of each bond price during the week.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Last Week's Cotton Yarn Market Without Special Changes</h3>
<p>People's Bids (Early week supported by factory insistence, weekend hindered by spot sales of third-grade goods)</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market has seen no significant changes in the past week. However, the overall situation is unfavorable. The state of the world's cotton industry remains weak, and third-grade American cotton yarn continues to trend downward. Therefore, the Chaozhou merchants have a strong desire to dump their holdings and maintain a calm attitude. However, some manufacturers are still tightening their grip, while a major manufacturer, seeing the global situation deteriorating and still holding inventory, remains indifferent. Only a small portion is extremely optimistic. However, due to the overall trend, it is difficult to maintain support alone. British factories are taking the opportunity to release a large batch of 20-count Five Rams cotton yarn, more than 10,000 bales. With this batch of spot goods on the market, sellers are becoming more confident. Based on the overall trend, there is no prospect of aggressive price increases. However, buyers, optimistic about the situation, believe that current demand may pick up. Therefore, they are buying to build up positions. Currently, both buyers and sellers have considerable power, and competition is fierce. Bids on the exchange initially rose due to factory support, but later weakened due to sluggish sales and a sharp drop in third-grade yarn. As a result, the prices for each month were similar to the previous week. Total transactions for the week were 51,350 bales. Various merchant groups bought a total of 6,733 bales of spot yarn. The market was flat and weak. The amount of bales purchased by each merchant group is listed below:</p>

<h3>Last Week's Cotton Bidding Market Remained Firm</h3>
<p>Raw cotton sales were sluggish due to Indian cotton encroachment... transactions were sparse.</p>
<p>Short harvests in various regions led to weak shipments... bullish sentiment also existed.</p>
<p>Actual cotton sales became increasingly quiet. Chinese and foreign factories have purchased enough Indian cotton to meet their needs for three to four months. In fact, because of the cheap prices, all traders are eagerly seeking a way out, and market prices are extremely accommodating. According to news from Japanese merchants, Indian cotton is being sold abroad at reduced prices due to factory closures and surplus raw materials. Japanese factories are procuring more than Chinese factories, encroaching on the position of domestic cotton. As a result, transactions on the market are sparse, and the amount of bales is also extremely small. The cotton bidding market remained firm because inland merchants, seeing poor harvests in their local areas, were buying more in the exchange. Although the harvest in Hankou was good, some operators were manipulating the market by not selling, resulting in a slight shortage of supply. Therefore, there were occasional bullish views. However, the large quantities of foreign cotton ordered by various factories are all due in November and December. When they arrive in Shanghai in a concentrated manner, there may be a drastic change. Bids on the exchange were slightly up by two qian compared to the previous week, with distant months remaining stable. Total transactions for the week were 126,400 dan. Factories bought 71,230 dan, and trading firms bought 4,900 dan. The source of goods at the docks included 9,700 bales of Yao cotton and 1,270 bales of general cotton. The amount of bales purchased by each factory and trading firm is listed below: Factory Purchases Highest Price Lowest Price Transaction Volume Term Fire Engine Cotton 32.75 32.50 1,000 bales Spot Delivery to Factory</p>

<h3>Last Week's American Cotton Remained Uncertain</h3>
<p>A New York cable report on the cotton market for the past week stated that the cotton market saw an increase in hedging and liquidation by near-month bulls, causing the market to fall sharply. The October contract nearly fell below 10 cents. However, as the market fell, hedging activities immediately provided support. At the same time, industry buying and short covering also occurred. Furthermore, with the actual situation improving, market prices rebounded by half a cent. However, as prices rose, buyers also exited the market. Therefore, the overall trend remains uncertain. As for group accounts, they believe that agricultural product prices are generally weak and remain indifferent to hoarding. However, the chairman of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, Mr. Legge, said that in his personal opinion, this is a great opportunity for those who want to stockpile goods.

<h3>American Cotton's Downward Trend Intensifies</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially fell due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, then rose due to short covering, and finally weakened again due to Southern hedging. Futures fell by 13 to 19 points, while spot prices fell by 15 points. British cotton futures fell by 3 points, while spot prices fell by 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. The Indian cotton market was closed.</p>

<h3>Grain Market: Rice Market in Hexia Turns from Stable to Rising</h3>
<p>Packaging for Export Transactions Resumes</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, there were more than 20 ships from the inland route. Sales on this street were extremely brisk, and there were also businesses packaging and transshipping to Qingdao. Due to the tight supply of production information, cargo owners are more inclined to sell at higher prices. As a result, new japonica rice immediately rose by 2-3 jiao. Special grade goods have already been offered at 17 yuan outside the Customs, with ordinary grades offered at 16.5 yuan. The market situation is quite good. Dongxin goods are very scarce, and large quantities are also in short supply, offered at 15.45 yuan. The price of new Sheep Tip rice has risen sharply, with customer demand, leading to a rise of about 4 jiao, reaching a high of 13.78 yuan. Dujian rice is 14 yuan to 13.8 yuan, also increased. Butip rice is 11.78 yuan, and Ketip rice is 11.5 yuan. All of the above have risen by 2-3 jiao. Because these goods are retailed by shops and restaurants, competition is keen, and transactions are smoother. The bottom stock has slightly decreased. Currently, the japonica and indica markets are about to turn sideways. The price of Baiyuan goods remains at 17.8 yuan. Baige paddy is sold as soon as it arrives. The market is not yet active, with prices around 16 yuan.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, about 30 ships arrived from the river, and sales were still good. The market for new japonica rice has become firmer, with high-grade goods at 16.5 yuan. Sales of ordinary Su-Tong japonica rice were sluggish, and prices increased slightly. The overall trend is similar to the previous session. The quality of japonica rice arrivals is uneven, and buyers' and sellers' perspectives are different, so price fluctuations are frequent. The market situation varies accordingly. Sales of South Shanghai Baige paddy and early rice such as Yishixing are not very smooth, and the situation is barely stable. The amount of high-grade Sheep Tip and Dujian rice arriving is extremely small, with ordinary grades predominating. Demand is not smooth, and the price of extra-high-grade goods is offered at 12 yuan outside the Customs. There is no sign of a change in the stability of Biyuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Japanese Sugar Showing a Downward Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw no cables from the production area due to the weekend. Market trading was sluggish. There was little interest in No. 24 Dutch sugar, coarse granulated white old goods. New goods were at a high of 8 liang 1 qian 2.5 fen for Xiang goods, with slight transactions. Finely ground granulated white sugar was at 8 liang 0.5 fen, and No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was at 7 liang 7 qian 5 fen. Demand was weak, and the market was flat and dull. Japanese sugar imports and exports were also sluggish, and the market showed a gradual decline. Mark prices were at 7 liang 9 qian 5 fen for M mark, 7 liang 8 qian for TK mark, 8 liang 1 qian for Liao mark, 7 liang 8 qian for YT mark, and 7 liang 6 qian 5 fen for TN mark. There were few buyers, sales remained sluggish, and the trend indicated a downward inclination.</p>

<h3>Mr. Fan Diven's Speech Yesterday on World Peace</h3>
<p>Only Democracy Can Defeat Autocracy; Then World Peace Can Be Permanently Guaranteed</p>
<p>Yesterday at 4 PM, Mr. Fan Diven, Chairman of the Second International and former Foreign Minister of Belgium, gave a public lecture at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on North Henan Road, titled "The Question of Peace." Accompanying Mr. Fan were Cai Yuanpei, Wang Jingqi, Wang Xiaolai, Yang Gongda, and the Belgian Minister to China, Hua Luosi. The majority of the audience were students, numbering about several hundred. Excerpts from Mr. Fan's speech are recorded below:</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei's Introductory Remarks　 Cai Yuanpei first delivered an introductory speech, stating that Mr. Fan Diven was born in 1866 and studied law, political economy, and sociology at the University of Brussels. At the age of 19, he obtained a doctorate in law and worked as a lawyer in Brussels. He joined the Labor Party and soon made it the most powerful socialist party in Belgium. In 1894, he was elected as a member of the House of Representatives and has remained in the parliamentary seat as the leader of the Socialist Party. From 1900 to 1918, he served as a professor at the University of Brussels. From 1916 to 1918, he was the Minister of Food Supply. From 1918 to 1921, he was the Minister of Justice and Vice-Chairman of the State Council. From 1925 to October 1927, he served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Vice-Chairman of the State Council. Mr. Fan's theories combine the ideas of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels from Germany, and Henri de Saint-Simon and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon from France. His economic views aim to abolish the capitalist system and private property, promote trade unions, temporarily allow the existence of small businesses and small landowners as a transition, and ultimately achieve public production and public consumption. His political views advocate universal suffrage as a means to obtain political power and the enactment of social legislation as a precursor to reform. In the International Socialist Congress held in London in 1896 and in Paris in 1900, Mr. Fan was already one of the most important leaders of the party. The issue of how to maintain international peace was of utmost importance at the meeting. After the European War, Mr. Fan especially devoted himself to the restoration of international peace, actively upholding the League of Nations and participating in the International Labor Bureau. His sincerity in loving peace is evident. Today's lecture on the theme of peace must have important implications and enlighten us. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Chinese Kuomintang, said in his doctrine of nationalism that the inherent morality of China includes a love of peace. Even at his death, he still cried out, "Struggle for peace to save China!" This shows the sincerity of our party's love for peace. Surely, Mr. Fan's words will be in agreement with ours. We now wish to invite Mr. Fan to enlighten us.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Versailles　 Mr. Fan then rose to speak amidst applause, translated by Yang Gongda, stating that he and the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister, Weierfu, had signed two important peace treaties, one being the Treaty of Versailles and the other being the Treaty of Locarno in 1925. The Versailles Peace Conference was convened after the end of the European War to resolve future peace issues. At that time, China and Belgium had special diplomatic interests in the conference due to their contributions to the war, that is, they could speak and make requests within the conference. However, the power of recognition and decision-making remained in the hands of the five powers of Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan, with Britain, France, and the United States having the greatest authority, hence the name "Conference of the Three Heads." After the opening of the conference, the French representative was the most forceful, stating that the conference should be based on the opinions of the victors and that the conditions decided could not be changed after they were proposed. The German representative had no choice but to succumb to the power and painfully accept the conditions. Therefore, the Versailles Peace Conference was not a truly consensual peace, but a forced peace backed by military force. However, five years later, the Locarno Peace Conference was reconvened, and the atmosphere changed. The British representative, Chamberlain, was able to consider the interests of all European countries. The German representative, although extremely forceful, was also very gentle. The French representative, Briand, also advocated humanitarian peace. Therefore, the result of the conference was a consensual and guaranteed peace, not a forced peace, which was absolutely different from the Versailles Peace Conference.</p>
<p>No War Recently　 Since the successive signing of the two treaties, Europe and the whole world have been able to maintain peace to a certain extent. However, local and partial small wars have occurred from time to time, which we cannot deny. Fortunately, none of them have affected the whole world. According to my personal observation, I dare to say that there will be no war in the near future regarding the horror and danger of future wars. I met the President of Czechoslovakia in Geneva and also inquired about this issue. He said that it would never happen because the raw materials for war were used up during the European War. With the source cut off, how could fire be generated? This statement completely coincides with my own opinion. If a country insists on defying the great injustice of the world and provoking a world war, it may be possible in theory, but the country's material economy and the people's psychology will not allow it, and it will inevitably lead to bankruptcy and failure.</p>
<p>Guarantee of Peace　 As for the guarantee of future peace, there must be one condition, that is, whether the forces of peace can overcome the forces of war. Otherwise, war cannot be avoided. In today's world peace plan, one is the Second International, which advocates cooperation among all ethnic groups in the world to overthrow autocracy and aggression to maintain and guarantee future peace. Another is the League of Nations. The League of Nations has indeed done considerable work in banning alcohol and other economic reforms and social undertakings. However, I have deep doubts as to whether it can truly maintain peace. The fact that the two major countries, the United States and Soviet Russia, have not joined the League of Nations is a major shortcoming. The United States of North America, including many ethnic groups, is implicitly another League of Nations. The Soviet Russian Social Federation can become a League of Nations. If China creates a federal China in the future, then China, with its vast land and abundant resources, can also be considered a League of Nations. Recently, Briand proposed a European Federation plan. If it can be realized, it will be another League of Nations. I generally agree with Mr. Briand's plan in principle, because Europe is in an era of group competition. If it is not united in terms of economy and materials, it will inevitably fail and go bankrupt in the future. However, when it will be realized is only a dream.</p>
<p>European Federation Plan　 There is a prerequisite for the realization of the European Federation plan, that is, countries with a common political organization should be united first. However, today's Europe has one type of country that is democratic and another that is autocratic. Can two extremely opposite political organizations be united? Therefore, it is said that realization is equal to a dream. If the European countries can still uphold the League of Nations and unite under the League of Nations, then success may be hoped for.</p>
<p>Permanent Peace　 To know whether peace can be maintained in the future and in the near future, it depends on whether democracy can defeat autocracy in the future. Otherwise, it is either a dream or completely hopeless. I admire China twelve million times. If the whole country can truly uphold the Three Principles of the People and be truly loyal to the Kuomintang, then when that day comes, not only will imperialism be completely overthrown throughout the world, but there will be no oppressed ethnic groups and no oppressor ethnic groups, and world peace will be permanently guaranteed.</p>
<p>Itinerary of the Hangzhou Tour　 After Mr. Fan finished his speech, he attended a tea party hosted by the Belgian Consul. Tonight, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will hold a banquet for Mr. and Mrs. Fan, and Cai Jiemin, the Belgian Minister, the Belgian Consul, Zhu Shaoping, Yang Gongda, and others will be invited to accompany them. Tomorrow night (the 7th) at 11 o'clock, they will take a special train prepared by the Ministry of Railways to Beijing. Mr. Fan also invited the Belgian Minister and his wife, Counselor Xue, Zhu Shaoping, Xu Kuanfu, Yang Gongda, and others to accompany him. It is also heard that Mr. Fan plans to take a plane back to Shanghai with the Belgian Minister, while Mrs. Fan and the Belgian Minister's wife will return to Shanghai by train. Yesterday, the Hangzhou side specially dispatched Mr. Peng from the Municipal Government to Shanghai to contact Mr. Zhu Shaoping on reception matters. They tentatively plan to go to Hangzhou on the 12th, stay at the Xiling Hotel, and be entertained by the Provincial Government in the evening. On the morning of the 13th, they will give a public lecture, attend a banquet somewhere at noon, and visit the mountains in the afternoon. On the morning of the 14th, they will give a lecture at Zhejiang University, attend a banquet somewhere at noon, and tour the lake in the afternoon. On the same day at 6 o'clock, they will take the night train back to Shanghai. On the 16th, the Pan-Pacific Association will invite Mr. Fan to give a lecture at the Cathay Hotel at noon. On the 17th, the Benevolent and Relief Society for Children will invite Mrs. Fan to give a lecture in the conference room of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. On the 18th, they will take the Lincoln to Guangdong.</p>
<h3>The Question of Installing Electric Lights on Zhongshan Road</h3>
<p>The Impact of Road Construction Beyond the Boundaries</p>
<p>Since the completion of the construction of Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has started to install electric lights. From Longhua to Hongqiao Road, it is handled by the Nanshi Electric Light Company. From Hongqiao Road to Suzhou Creek and the areas north of the creek, it is installed by the Zhabei Electric Light Company. The company had previously dispatched workers to install the ground wires. However, the police of the concession, due to the fact that Hongqiao Road and Xilu, etc., were related to road construction beyond the boundaries, dispatched a large number of armed police to stop the project at the intersections of the roads. The police district in charge also dispatched police to guard the area, forming a confrontational situation. Although the authorities repeatedly negotiated with the police of the concession afterward, the matter has not been resolved so far. Therefore, the ground wire project is still shelved. It is now known that all the utility poles along the road have been completely erected, even at the intersections of Hongqiao Road and Daxilu. However, the electric wires and light bulbs have not yet been installed. It is expected that they will be installed soon. In the future, when the electric wires are connected on the road, the electricity of the towns and factories in western Shanghai can be recovered and supplied by the Chinese territory, recovering the electric power rights and interests.</p>
<h3>Preparations for National Day by All Sectors</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Preparatory Committee for Celebrating National Day by All Sectors in the City has been actively preparing and sparing no effort. News of the separate progress in various rural districts has been repeatedly reported in various newspapers. The latest developments are recorded separately below:</p>

<h3>Wang Jingqi Hosted a Banquet for Fan Diven Yesterday</h3>
<p>Dr. Wang Jingqi, the Minister to Belgium, hosted a banquet for Mr. and Mrs. Fan Diven, the former Foreign Minister of Belgium, and Mr. Hua Luosi, the Belgian Minister, at the Dahua Hotel yesterday afternoon. The guests included Cai Jiemin, Di Pingzi, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Rizhang, Qi Yunqing, Hu Mengjia, Zhang Zhuping, Liu Zhanen, Wu Shan, Li Baiyu, Lin Yutang, Liu Yunfang, and their wives, totaling over a hundred people. Halfway through the meal, Mr. Wang delivered a speech, saying, "Mr. Fan, Mrs. Fan, during the tense times of the European War more than ten years ago, our friend July Destree worked hard to come to China from Siberia to give lectures on European politics and the reasons for fighting with the Allied Powers. We often saw him. After the war, we discussed how to proceed, academic exchanges between China and Belgium, and how the European People's Party and the Chinese People's Party should assist each other in the struggle to promote the opening of the minds of the people. Therefore, for ten years, the Chinese Embassy in Brussels has had the closest relationship with famous professors in Belgium. President Cai has stayed in Belgium for a long time and has also strongly advocated it. I am particularly pleased that Mr. Fan is coming to China to give lectures, because it is in line with our long-held ideal of enabling direct contact between people and direct understanding between people. Now we have used the method of academic cooperation to make a starting point. Mr. Fan should see during this trip to China that China greatly respects Belgium, first because Belgium has provided much assistance to China's new construction in the past, and second because hundreds of Chinese children have studied in Belgium. The Alumni Association expressed that kind of personal admiration the other day, which shows that they deeply worship and are very grateful to the place where they originally studied and the teachers they listened to as children. Mr. Fan can also see that China in the past liked to study new knowledge and compare theories. The Kuomintang of Belgium, like Mr. Fan, has been fighting for the oppressed throughout his life, and naturally understands the current situation in China. Personally, I hope that Mr. Fan will bring back a feeling when he returns to Europe, saying that although China is still in a difficult transition period, it will soon be on track and start the Three People's construction, and soon have a peaceful and prosperous China that can work together internationally for many peace works. I now, in addition to celebrating the health of Mr. and Mrs. Fan, also hope that the cultural contact between China and Belgium will become closer and closer, so that all workers in the East and the West, whether they are mental or physical, regardless of class, can work together to create an enlarged nation of universal harmony." Then Mr. Fan answered the speech, which was translated into Chinese by Mr. Yang Gongda. They took photos and dispersed happily at 3 o'clock.</p>
<h3>A Brief Account of Mr. Subereff's World Tour</h3>
<p>Two Years of Travel, Tasting Hardships</p>
<p>Soon Returning to Announce Success</p>
<p>The Mainland Daily reported that Mr. Subereff, a Westerner, set off from the front of the YMCA in this city on November 7, 1928, alone on a motorcycle, suffering from hunger, thirst, bandits, and other difficulties, touring the world for nearly two years. He has now arrived in Vancouver, Canada, and will soon cross the ocean and return to Shanghai to announce his success. When Mr. Subereff departed, he only carried twenty yuan with him and had no other belongings. After passing through China and entering the territory of Siam, he passed through a swampy, miasmic, and ferocious beastly land that no white man had ever passed through, lasting twenty-four days in total, which was the most dangerous part of the journey. When he arrived in the Straits Settlements, the road was smooth. From Penang to Singapore, he averaged 124 miles per day, setting a new record for motorcycles. When he arrived in Singapore, the local officials personally came out to welcome him, and the local people warmly received him. Therefore, his old car was worn out, so he bought a new car. A German named Boros was willing to drive with him, so they set off together. However, only a hundred miles away from Singapore, the German injured his leg when his car overturned and stayed in the hospital for treatment. Mr. Subereff continued his journey alone, passing through Yangon, Calcutta, Mumbai, and Lahore, and arrived in Karachi. He traversed 787 kilometers of desert land between Lahore and Karachi by motorcycle, which had never been done before. When he arrived in Karachi, the welcome was more grand than in Singapore. At one banquet, a British official specially presented him with a new car, which is the one he is currently riding. Afterwards, he encountered the plight of the Gu'er tribe and other bandits in Persia. Fortunately, the car was fast enough to escape danger. When he arrived in Baghdad, he crossed 900 kilometers of the Arabian Desert to Dama Village. From there, he passed through Syria, Palestine, France, Italy, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Belgium, England, America, Canada, and other countries. He has now arrived in Vancouver and will set off for Shanghai in a few weeks, returning to his destination to announce his success.</p>
<h3>The Portuguese Consulate Celebrated the Republic</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 5th) was the 20th anniversary of the abdication of the Portuguese King Manuel and the establishment of the republican government. The Portuguese Consul General in Shanghai, Benadu, held a grand celebration ceremony at the consulate on Huaxun Road at 11:30 AM yesterday, with over a hundred Chinese and foreign guests attending. The meeting did not disperse until 1:00 PM. All Portuguese expatriates in this city and foreign warships stationed in Shanghai flew flags to pay tribute. At 9:00 AM in the morning, each warship fired 21 salutes to show respect. At 5:00 PM in the evening, the Portuguese team of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps held a tea party at the Atlantic General Association at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Haining Road, which was quite a grand occasion for a while.</p>
<h3>Fujian Investigators Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Fujian Provincial Government specially dispatched five graduates of the construction group of the Fujian Administrative Personnel Training Institute, namely You Chongtai, Hu Zhangyuan, Chen Qianqiu, Li Guangpin, and Chen Jun'an, to Jiangsu and Zhejiang to investigate construction projects because the time has come for political tutelage and construction talents are needed. The personnel have arrived in Shanghai on the Huaan ship on the 2nd and went to the Municipal Government and various bureaus to investigate cases. They now plan to go to Zhejiang.</p>
<h3>Notice on Citizen Registration in Southeastern City</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau is actively carrying out personnel registration in order to prevent bandits and maintain social security. Previously, the household registration police of the First District and Second Precinct notified the office of the Southeast City Business Federation, instructing shops, households, and residents to report and register in detail if there is a population movement that has not been reported and registered, and to correct it separately for investigation. Yesterday, the office issued a notice saying, "Sincerely, we received a notice from the household registration police of the First District and Second Precinct, stating that they have been ordered by their superiors, in view of the current dangerous situation, that this city is a prosperous area where people gather, with a mix of good and bad people, and it is inevitable that bandits will kidnap, threaten, and defraud, mixing among them. Therefore, the household registration investigation in this district is strictly carried out to maintain social security. All citizens within the jurisdiction must register separately with the district office, or if there are registered people whose population has moved without reporting, they should report to the office for correction in detail, so that they can be investigated in the future and avoid punishment, etc. To the association, but the movement of shop residents may have some misunderstandings, for the special notice to come, pray that everyone pays attention, that is, hope to follow the office to do, avoid drying punishment, etc."</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Inland River Ship Registration Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Construction Bureau formulated the Shanghai County Inland River Ship Registration Regulations, which will be implemented this month, starting registration from the 1st, and ordered all ship bureaus to come to the bureau for registration within a time limit of one month. If they fail to comply after the deadline, they will be ordered to stop sailing and will not be tolerated. Yesterday, Director Wu reported the start date of registration to the county government for record. The provisional regulations for registration are copied as follows: (Article 1) These regulations are specially formulated for the purpose of developing transportation and protecting navigation ships in this county, and should be followed. (Article 2) All inland river ship companies in this county that operate ships within the territory, whether existing or newly established, must apply to the Construction Bureau for registration and obtain a registration certificate.

<p>Kong Fanjun, the Chief of the Police Department for the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai), Huhu (Shanghai-Hangzhou), and Huhyong (Shanghai-Ningbo) Railways, yesterday issued an order to the police sub-sections at both the North and South Stations, stating that in order to comply with regulations, a letter had been received from the General Affairs Department of the Railway Administration stating that unlicensed vehicles entering the stations were causing the greatest disruption to traffic order. Regulations should be established and strictly enforced to ensure compliance. Considering the different circumstances of each station, a uniform investigation is necessary.

<h3>Funding Issues for the Defense Corps</h3>
<p>Since receiving orders to reorganize, the various teams under the Shanghai Municipal Hubei District Defense Corps have already completed the reorganization according to the new system. However, regarding funding, due to previous instructions from the supervisory authorities prohibiting the collection of donations, they are facing great difficulties. The municipal government had previously agreed to provide subsidies on a tiered monthly basis, but the teams have not yet received them after the reorganization. Therefore, the team leaders have jointly petitioned the two Chiefs, Ye and Wang, to expedite the verification and issuance of the funds to maintain operations.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Housing in Fuxing Lane</h3>
<p>The sixty-plus houses in Fuxing Lane on Mackenzie Road were originally the estate of the Zhao family from Ningbo. Last winter, due to a property division among the Zhao brothers, Mr. Fu, a manager of a certain firm, was entrusted to sell them. Fu, seeing the daily increase in land prices in the area, and knowing that someone had offered 500,000 taels, believed it was a profitable opportunity. He purchased the properties from the Zhao family for 340,000 taels and then resold them to Wing On Real Estate Company for 580,000 taels in July this year. With this transaction, Fu made a profit of over 200,000 taels. However, after purchasing the properties at a high price, Wing On Real Estate Company intends to rebuild them for substantial profit. At the end of August, they issued a notice ordering tenants to pay their September rent and vacate the premises by the end of September. The Tenants' Association of Fuxing Lane, feeling pressured by the company, held a meeting and unanimously demanded that the company postpone the relocation until April of next year. The company refused their request, leading to a dispute. It is reported that both parties have hired lawyers to negotiate, and the outcome remains uncertain.</p>

<h3>Continued Report on the Pushen Mountain Villa's Jiangzhe Burial Department</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Junsheng, the director of Pushen Mountain Villa, since being entrusted by Mr. Wang Yiting, chairman of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations United Association in the year of Wuchen (1928), to handle the temporary burial matters at the Jiangzhe border area, has found over 160,000 sets of exposed skeletal remains. For the past three years, burials have been conducted in both spring and winter, and so far, five burials have been completed, burying a total of 29,713 sets of remains. Due to the lack of large sums of money, they have only been able to continuously raise donations and conduct burials in stages. As the winter season approaches, Mr. Wang recently went to Jiaxing Wangjiangjing Puyuan to discuss continued burial procedures this winter with local charitable organizations and gentry, and has obtained concrete plans. However, it has been found that there are still over 100,000 sets of unburied skeletal remains in various places, requiring significant funding. A large sum of money must be raised to bury all of the over 100,000 sets of remains. It has been negotiated with Mr. Wang Yiting to draw a vertical scroll of "Ten Thousand Families and Living Buddhas" and Yi Junzhai to write a couplet with seal script, which have been given to the stone printing shop for brocade mounting as gifts for those who donate to the Jiangzhe burial funds. The Leshan Society has agreed to help raise funds by performing operas. At that time, guests who appreciate the performances will be given a full set of vertical scrolls and couplets, as well as funds for enjoying the moment, to collect fees for burying the exposed remains, so that the skeletal remains all over the place can be buried for peace. Helping charity and appreciating calligraphy are truly two birds with one stone.</p>
<h3>Medical News from the Lianyi Benevolent Society</h3>

<h3>Inspection Rules for Electricity Theft Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>The Huashang Electric Company, believing that there should be amendments to the rules for inspecting electricity theft and recovering electricity fees from users, submitted a request to the Construction Committee. Yesterday, the company received instructions from the Construction Committee, stating that amending the rules was not approved and providing a detailed rejection of each clause. The rejected clauses are excerpted as follows: (1) Criminal law has specific provisions for electricity theft. When a company discovers electricity theft, it must submit the case to the court for investigation, which is a legal procedure that cannot be violated. As for the company's recovery of electricity fees, according to the provisions of Rules 5 and 6, it can be directly recovered, forming an incidental civil lawsuit. However, the criminal part still needs to be judged by the court to comply with the principle that guilt must be punished. It is not appropriate to disregard national laws due to the company's cumbersome procedures. Regarding whether the judge's punishment is appropriate, that is another matter. (2) The calculation method for recovering electricity fees is very clear in the various articles of the rules. If there are concerns that the judge lacks electrical knowledge, electricians can be invited to provide expert opinions as evidence. (3) Calculating electric lights for 12 hours and electric fans and heaters for 6 months is a general provision. If it can be proven that there are special circumstances in the city, such as using electricity for more than 12 hours or 6 months, it can be calculated according to 24 hours a day for the whole year. Even if non-users steal electricity without meters, it can be calculated according to wattage and horsepower. The rules already have clear regulations. (4) Although the company has many users, if inspections are conducted effectively, it should be possible to detect all cases of electricity theft. It is extremely rare for users to steal electricity completely after meter installation, causing the meter to not move at all. If it is not because the company's meter is inaccurate and there is indeed electricity theft, it can be handled according to Article 5 for non-user electricity theft. When users apply for transfer of ownership, the company should send personnel to verify the authenticity. How can it be allowed to be obscured? (5) The rules stipulate the act of electricity theft and the calculation method for recovering electricity fees. Whether to stop supplying electricity after discovering electricity theft should be stipulated in the regulations for cracking down on electricity theft. Before these regulations are announced, the original procedures can be temporarily followed.</p>
<h3>Party Department Seals Must Follow Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Department received a notice from the Provincial Organization Department yesterday, stating that the department has previously issued a notice regarding the seals of various departments and offices of county party departments in accordance with central regulations. Recently, it has been found that many counties have not complied with the regulations, and the size and style of the seals are inconsistent, which is inappropriate. A notice is hereby issued again to ensure compliance in the future. The details are as follows: (1) The seal should be made of wood and square, measuring 1.6 inches; (2) The size should be measured according to the construction ruler; (3) The width of the seal border should be one-tenth of the size; (4) The seal text should be in Yang Seal script; (5) The text should read "Executive Committee/Party Affairs Reorganization Committee of the [Province] [County] Branch of the Chinese Nationalist Party [Department Name] Seal." Those whose style is non-compliant should immediately re-engrave and submit for verification to demonstrate caution. When directly issuing documents or submitting forms, the department seal should be properly affixed to ensure accountability. Please be informed.</p>

<h3>Catholic Pilgrimage and Observance Period</h3>

<h3>Shaji Foreign Firm Accountant Embezzles Large Sum and Flees to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Embezzling 33,000 Yuan of Public Funds</p>
<p>Bai Rixuan and He Rong are Arrested</p>
<p>Transferred to Guangzhou Court for Trial</p>
<p>Chen Jianji and Bai Rixuan from Guangdong were previously the chief and assistant accountants at the Lide Foreign Firm in Shaji, Guangdong. Recently, they colluded to embezzle 33,000 yuan of public funds and fled to Shanghai. The foreign firm learned of this and sent a letter to the German Consulate in Shanghai, along with photos of Chen and Bai, requesting assistance in their arrest. The German Consulate transferred the photos to the General Inspection Office of the General Patrol House, ordering them to investigate. Chief Ayers instructed Chinese detectives Feng Zhiming, Pang Ruiqing, Wang Chengying, Feng Shuofu, and Zhang Shaoqing to investigate whether any new arrivals from Guangdong were staying at major hotels. The detectives, upon receiving the order, began investigating and finally found Bai Rixuan staying in room 320 on the third floor of the Dongya Hotel on Nanjing Road at 11 PM on the 3rd. The registered place of origin was Guangdong, and it was learned that he was a new arrival. The detectives knew that the Bai person was undoubtedly Bai Rixuan and went to the room to investigate. They saw two people in the room, one of whom was identical to Bai Rixuan. When asked his name, he admitted to being Bai Rixuan. The other person, named He Rong, was a clerk from Lide Foreign Firm and came with Bai this time. The detectives, suspecting him as well, arrested and detained both of them at the patrol house. The next morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Division of the Special District Court. Patrol House lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the case, stating that the incident occurred in Shaji, Guangdong, and all the evidence was there. If the case was handled by the court, the investigation of various evidence would be quite complicated. It would be better to transfer the case to the Guangdong court for handling, but the patrol house also has difficulties in the transfer. Therefore, the patrol house thought of a way: the patrol house notified the Municipal Public Security Bureau, ordering them to send detectives to the case, take the two criminals away, and transfer them to Guangdong. The procedures seemed more convenient. Today, Director Yuan of the Municipal Public Security Bureau has officially sent detectives to the case, and it is expected that the presiding judge will also agree, etc. Therefore, the detectives reported the circumstances of the arrest, and the detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wang Shenqing, delivered the official documents requesting the transfer. When questioned, the defendants denied embezzling public funds. Judge Xu Jiashi verified the confession and ordered Bai Rixuan and He Rong to be handed over to the detectives to be taken back and transferred to the Guangzhou court for trial.</p>
<h3>Judgment in Tang Huixuan's Lawsuit Against His Wife for Adultery</h3>
<p>Tang Huixuan, a Ph.D. in economics, filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the District Court against his wife, Zou Aizhen, and Chen Genwei for adultery. The trial was conducted publicly by Judge Wu Zhen. As a result, the court ruled that the suspicions alleged by Tang could not be proven, and Zou and Chen were found not guilty. The original text of the judgment has been obtained and is transcribed below. Plaintiff Tang Huixuan, 36 years old, from Guangxi, residing at No. 19, Lane 3, Jinchengli, Daxing Street, outside Xiaoximen. Defendant Zou Aizhen, 25 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 821, Zhonghua Road. Defendant Chen Genwei, 28 years old, businessman from Shanghai, residing at No. 821, Zhonghua Road. The above-mentioned defendants are accused of interfering with marriage. After the plaintiff filed the lawsuit, this court made the following judgment after trial: (Judgment) Zou Aizhen and Chen Genwei are both not guilty. (Reason) According to the plaintiff Tang Huixuan's testimony, he heard rumors from friends that his wife, Zou Aizhen, and Chen Genwei were having an affair. On August 16th, at 5:00 AM, he brought the police and three others to Zou's house. He went upstairs first and saw Zou Aizhen and Chen Genwei in bed together. He immediately called the police upstairs and arrested Zou and Chen. The defendant Zou Aizhen testified that she lived in the front building with her mother, etc., and Chen Genwei lived in the back building. They first dragged my sister away. I heard the noise and came out, and then they dragged me away. The testimonies of the defendant Chen Genwei and Zou Aizhen's mother, Zou Yu, and sister, Yuezhen, were also the same. The testimonies of the two parties differed. This court summoned the police officer He Fenglin, who accompanied Tang Huixuan to Zou's house at the time. He Fenglin testified that Tang Huixuan ordered him to go upstairs. He went to the entrance of the stairs, and Tang and the people he invited twisted Chen Genwei and Zou Aizhen and handed them over to him to take to the station, etc. Based on this, Zou and Chen were not caught by the police on the spot, but were twisted and handed over by Tang Huixuan and the people he invited. Whether Zou and Chen were twisted in the same bed or in the front and back buildings, the police did not see it in person. The people invited by Tang Huixuan to catch the adultery testified that one was a driver, one was surnamed Xu, and one did not know his name. They did not know their addresses. When asked who the Xu person was, he sometimes said he was his friend, sometimes said he was a friend of a friend, and could not give a concrete name of the friend. His testimony was evasive and clearly untruthful. Based on the above conclusion, the criminal suspicion of the defendants Zou Aizhen and Chen Genwei cannot be proven. According to Article 316 of the Criminal Procedure Law, they should be found not guilty, as in the judgment. This case may be appealed to the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal. The appeal period is 10 days from the date of service of the judgment.</p>
<h3>Rebuilding of the Stone Bridge at the South Gate of Baoshan Completed</h3>
<p>Last month, the arsenal sent personnel to use trucks to transport newly manufactured heavy artillery to the seawall outside the North Gate of Baoshan for trial firing. When the truck passed over the stone drawbridge outside the South Gate of Baoshan, the stone bridge was crushed and collapsed into the river because it had been built for many years and could not bear the heavy load. The bridge was about ten feet long and wide, and it was an important thoroughfare from the artillery platform to the city. Since the collapse, pedestrians and vehicles have found it inconvenient. Afterwards, the Baoshan County Government sent a letter to the arsenal to negotiate, and the Baoshan County Construction Bureau designed and surveyed the drawings. The arsenal funded the reconstruction, which was completed yesterday. The bridge piers on both sides are made of stone, and the bridge body is made of railway sleepers. The bridge deck is also wider than the old bridge, and the project is quite solid.</p>
<h3>Accident Caused by Defense Corps Member Cleaning a Gun</h3>
<p>Shen Zhixing, a 20-year-old from Dachang, worked as a clerk in Zhang Xiechang Rice Shop near the Zhenru Railway Station and served as a volunteer member of the local Defense Corps. Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, he was holding a nine-shot pistol and cleaning the gun casing with abrasive debris. Unexpectedly, there was still a bullet left inside. With a loud bang, the bullet was ejected from the casing and hit his left leg. Blood gushed out like a spring. He was then transported by car to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Mid-Autumn Moon Eclipse</h3>
<p>Mid-Autumn Festival is on the 8th, not the 6th</p>
<p>There will be a lunar eclipse on the morning of the 8th</p>
<p>Recently, it has been said in the city that the Mid-Autumn Festival is on the 6th of this month, which is purely a fallacy of following the 15th day of the eighth month of the abolished lunar calendar. According to the central government's circular, the Mid-Autumn Festival is the full moon day closest to the autumn equinox, which is the 8th of this month. The old custom of celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival by enjoying the moon and entertainment is also based on the fact that the autumn season is clear and cloudless, and the moon on the full moon day is particularly round and bright. Therefore, people celebrate the reunion by feasting and enjoying the moon. The 6th of this month is not the full moon day, so where does the reunion come from? It should follow the central government's regulations and take the 8th as the Mid-Autumn Festival, and should not repeat the error of the abolished lunar calendar and enjoy this incomplete moon. It has also been found that there will be a lunar eclipse on the morning of the 8th, which will begin at 0:42 AM on the 7th, with the initial eclipse at 2:46:2 AM, the greatest eclipse at 3:06:5 AM, and the full recovery at 5:31:9 AM.</p>
<h3>Medical and Pharmaceutical Professionals Visit the Bulida Manufacturing Factory</h3>
<p>The Jiufu Company in this city manufactures pure and compound Bulida, which has been well-received by Chinese people and has attracted the attention of the medical and pharmaceutical communities since its launch. The company has invited professionals from the medical and pharmaceutical industries to visit the Bulida manufacturing factory to study and promote academic exchange. The visit was scheduled for yesterday, October 5th, and professionals from the medical and pharmaceutical industries arrived successively starting at 1:00 PM, including Tang Lizhou, Yu Dawang, Song Guobin, Cheng Hanzhang, Zhu Qiluo, Ding Fubao, Zhao Wuqiao, Huang Guanqing, Xie Yunshou, and others, over 200 people in total. Huang Chujiu, the general manager of the company, personally welcomed them. Wu Yugong, Chen Xingwu, Wang Longchao, and others led them to the manufacturing factory, where chemist Shen Jichuan and pharmacist Zhou Mengbai explained the structure of the machines, the principles of drug manufacturing, the method of extracting and rolling jugal, and the procedures for making Bulida to the visiting guests. The audience was knowledgeable in medicine and pharmaceuticals, so after the visit, they were quite clear and praised the company's complete mechanical equipment and the progress of the pharmaceutical industry, which can be compared with major European and American pharmaceutical factories. They deeply believed that the success of Bulida is the bright future of China's pharmaceutical industry, and that imported goods will be gradually reduced in China's pharmaceutical market. After the visit, tea and snacks were served. It was also heard that the company wants to make the contents of Bulida clear to all sectors of society and will regularly welcome public visits.</p>
<h3>Flower Community Promotes Domestic Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Shanghai's famous courtesans, such as Xiang Jun, have always had patriotic enthusiasm. Yesterday (the 5th), at 7:00 PM, they specially held a banquet at Xinghualou on Simalu for dozens of courtesans in Shanghai to promote the smoking of domestic cigarettes. The gathering of the courtesans was extremely grand and there were profound speeches. It was roughly said that we, the flower community, are a part of the nation and should love domestic goods. Cigarettes are a necessary item for social occasions, and the daily cost is considerable. We should not allow the rights and interests to flow out. The Baijlnlong and Meilanfang cigarettes produced by the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company are the best domestic cigarettes and can be compared with imported cigarettes. The cigarette flavor is rich and the price is fair. In the future, our flower community will use domestic cigarettes to entertain guests, vigorously promote them, and persuade guests to smoke them at any time.</p>
<h3>Investigation and Prohibition of Aphrodisiac "Long Life Happiness Water"</h3>
<p>Central Health Testing Institute Tests for Toxic Substances: The Third District Party Department of this city previously found that the Ailisi Pharmacy was selling "Long Life Happiness and Harmony Water", which is a type of aphrodisiac. After reporting this to the Municipal Party Department for investigation and prohibition, a letter was received from the Secretariat of the Municipal Party Department, stating that the Shanghai Municipal Government's Public Letter No. 1978 approved the Municipal Party Committee's Letter No. 11220, stating that the "Long Life Happiness and Harmony Water" sold by Ailisi Pharmacy has been tested by the Central Health Testing Institute to contain toxic substances and should be banned. In addition to ordering the bureau to strictly investigate and prohibit the sale of the drug, the letter also instructed the relevant authorities to inform the concession authorities to jointly prohibit the sale of the drug in order to protect public health. The relevant case is hereby recorded and forwarded for your information and compliance.</p>
<h3>Robberies at the Cui Family's Banxianglu Are Repeatedly Solved</h3>
<p>Zhao Yichun's family, the owner of the Cui family's Banxianglu at No. 1681 Xinzha Road, was robbed by eight robbers at 6:00 AM on June 12th this year. The robbers stole valuables worth 12,000 yuan. After the case occurred, the patrol house arrested four robbers, including Lu Minghan, and handed them over to the court for trial. On the 1st of this month, the Old Gate Patrol House's Chinese detectives Huang Fuson and Zhu Ziqing arrested two leaders of the case, Yu Guimao (nicknamed "Little Wuxi") and Zhu Heao (nicknamed "Little Quan'gen"), at the intersection of Dagu Road and Xizang Road, seizing two pistols and ten bullets. They were handed over to the Special District Court for interrogation. The details were reported in this newspaper. Subsequently, the criminals confessed that Zhang Fufu from Shanghai was their informant and lived at No. 69 Song Park Road in Zhabei. Chinese detective Song Bingzheng and other detectives from the Public Security Bureau went to the address to arrest Zhang and brought him back to the patrol house. Under questioning, Zhang admitted that he had received 95 yuan. The criminals also confessed that they had sold 708 robbed pearls to Zhang Zimei, a shop assistant at Yuanchangcheng Jewelry Store at No. 337 Hankou Road, for 695 yuan. The patrol house suspected that Zhang had received stolen goods and also arrested and detained him. The next morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Division of the Special District Court. Patrol House lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the defendant Zhang Fufu was arrested after being confessed by the criminals. As for the reason for Zhang Zimei's arrest, after the robbery, the robbers went to the Continental Hotel on Avenue Edward VII to divide the spoils. At that time, Zhang went to the Continental Hotel to purchase the above-mentioned pearls, but the price was not right, so he returned them to the store. Later, the robbers brought the pearls to Zhang's store and sold them for 695 yuan. The patrol house believed that Zhang must have known that the pearls were illegally obtained. How did Zhang know that someone was selling pearls in the Continental Hotel and went to buy them, and whether the robbers had such valuable items? Therefore, he is suspected of receiving stolen goods. Then, the criminals testified that Zhang Fufu was indeed involved in the robbery case, and Zhang Zimei was the one we called to the Continental Hotel. At that time, we falsely claimed that the items were entrusted by relatives in the countryside for sale, etc. Judge Zhou Han verified the report, questioned the two defendants, and ordered the case to be adjourned for trial. Zhang Fufu was remanded in custody, and Zhang Zimei was released on bail of 1,000 yuan. It was also heard that the patrol house arrested another accomplice, Han Heshang, at No. 4 Shenjiazai, Taiyangmiao Road, Zhabei, at 4:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Refusing to Pay for Food and Assaulting the Restaurant</h3>
<p>Fly-Lu Film Company employees Zhu Mengjue, Ma Xiaojue, and Wang Lifan, residing at No. 35 Renji Road, were recently criminally charged with assault by Xu Zhanqi, a waiter from the Dazhonghua Restaurant at No. 181 Sichuan Road, and represented by lawyer Tao Wuzhi in the Special District Court. The grounds for the prosecution stated that on the 13th of last month at 8:15 PM, the defendants ordered a meal consisting of one serving of Chinese dishes for one dollar and eight jiao, and two servings of plain rice, totaling one dollar and nine jiao and six fen, from the Dazhonghua Restaurant. The plaintiff delivered the food, and half an hour later, went to collect the money and dishes. Unexpectedly, the defendants refused to pay. The plaintiff stated that if they wished to put it on account, they would have to discuss it with the restaurant in person. The three defendants, enraged and ashamed, immediately resorted to violence, assaulting and injuring the plaintiff. They also smashed all the basins and bowls in the plaintiff's hands. Subsequently, Chinese constables from No. 2621 arrived and took the three defendants to the police station. However, the defendants were proficient in English and deceived the head constable, who therefore refused to handle the case and advised the plaintiff to file a lawsuit in court. Therefore, the plaintiff filed a complaint, requesting that the defendants be punished according to the law and ordered to compensate the restaurant for the cost of the food, one dollar and nine jiao and six fen; the bowls, basins, and rice pots, six dollars and three jiao and six fen; and medical expenses of fifty yuan. The court, upon receiving the complaint, approved the request and issued a warrant to the Huishi Police Station, ordering them to notify the three defendants to appear in court for trial at the appointed time.</p>
<h3>Burning Memorial Tea Leaves</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Nanshi Yanmatou Street Tea Merchants Association reported last month to the relevant authorities that it had intercepted two hundred and twenty bags of "memorial tea leaves" in Li Heji Coal Store on Doushi Street, and requested that they be burned. The Health Bureau has now confirmed through testing that the tea leaves are extremely harmful to health. Therefore, with the approval of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, it was decided that the tea leaves would be burned in their entirety at 2:00 PM yesterday (October 4th) on an open space at the west end of Guohuo Road. Police officers from the First District Public Security Bureau were dispatched to the scene to provide security. Over twenty representatives from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Health Bureau, and the Tea Merchants Association, among others, were present to supervise the execution. The Tea Merchants Association took photographs of the burning as a memento. The burning concluded at six o'clock.</p>

<h3>Woman Takes Poison Upon Hearing of Aunt's Death</h3>
<p>Liu Qiu, a young woman from Zhuji, was twenty-nine years old. Her husband, Ming Shan, worked as a farmer in their hometown. Last spring, Ms. Liu and her aunt, Ms. Xu, age twenty, came to Shanghai and lived in a room in a lane house on Wuhua Road in Hongkou. They worked as female laborers in a Hua Zhi silk factory, leaving early and returning late, enjoying a relatively peaceful life. Unfortunately, Ms. Xu became pregnant and returned to her hometown last month to await childbirth, while Ms. Qiu remained in Shanghai to work. Yesterday afternoon, while Ms. Qiu was having lunch, a postman delivered an express letter. Upon opening it, she learned that her aunt, Ms. Xu, had died four days earlier due to childbirth. Upon hearing this, Ms. Qiu was extremely shocked and appeared depressed. Yesterday evening, she secretly took one yuan's worth of opium paste outside. Neighbors noticed and hired a streetcar to take her to Tongren Hospital and then to Guangren Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, she had taken too much poison and her life was in danger.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Assault on Yinhe Road Last Night</h3>
<p>Wang Hezhong, a native of Anhui, twenty-seven years old, had been running the Yongtai Department Store at the intersection of Yinhe Road in Yangshupu. Because business was sluggish, he attracted the attention of robbers. Last night at 8:30 PM, one man in a long gown and two in short jackets broke into the store. Using the pretext of buying socks, they produced handguns and threatened him. Wang was at the counter settling accounts at the time. Realizing that criminals had arrived, he tried to turn around and escape through the back door, but was caught by one of the robbers, who pointed a gun at his chest and forced him to reveal where the money was hidden. Wang claimed he had no money. The robber then fired a shot, hitting Wang's right leg. Bleeding profusely, Wang fell to the ground. The robbers saw over twenty paper dollars on the counter, put them into a bag, and fled in a hurry, leaving no trace. Constable No. 768 arrived and took the injured Wang to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Women's Association Rescues Zhang Hecui</h3>
<p>Zhu Zhangwan, from Ningbo, lived at No. 94 and a half Shengmao Lane, Oujia Road. He worked as a Western-style tailor and had a son named A Miao, who worked as a carpenter. A Miao had been betrothed to Zhang Hecui, a woman from the same village, since childhood. Hecui is now</p>
<p>twenty-one years old. She came to the Zhu family as a child bride at the age of nine, and the marriage was consummated at sixteen. However, although A Miao was grown up at the time, his development was incomplete and there were changes, causing Hecui great pain. Zhangwan and his wife did not investigate carefully,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>and falsely accused their daughter-in-law of not being affectionate towards her husband, leading to discord. They first made the young couple sleep in separate beds and then subjected her to various forms of abuse. Hecui, unable to bear the oppression, secretly wrote a letter to her mother last year, crying out her sorrows. Her mother and brother, upon receiving the letter, rushed to Shanghai and took her back to her hometown to live temporarily. After half a year, Zhangwan still did not send anyone to bring her back. Hecui and her mother then took a boat to Hankou to work as servants to make a living. In the fifth month of this year by the lunar calendar, Zhangwan and his wife tricked Hecui and her mother into coming to Shanghai and forced them to sign a divorce agreement, severing the marital relationship between Hecui and A Miao. Each side kept a copy of the agreement. Her mother returned to Hankou, while Hecui was kept at home for another three months. Hecui, finding her daily life unbearable and hearing rumors that the Zhangwan family was planning something sinister, fled alone in the middle of the night a few days ago. On the way, she met a girlfriend who used to work with her in a cigarette factory and told her the truth. The friend pretended to be very sympathetic and</p>
<p>kept Hecui in her home for several days. Suddenly, she had a malicious thought and planned to sell Hecui to someone else for a price. On the agreed day, the girlfriend falsely claimed that she was taking Hecui to Pudong to play and hired two rickshaws, pulling them directly towards Xinzha Bridge. On the way, Hecui discovered the treacherous plot and became terrified. She fled again to the home of her cousin, Zhu Changwang, at No. 128 Lao Yong Sheng Li, Guangfu Road, Zhabei, to beg for help. Zhu, after learning the whole story, seeing that his cousin was young and weak, had been abandoned by her husband's family, and had narrowly escaped a major fraud, found her situation pitiful. He drafted a petition on her behalf, recounting the suffering Hecui had endured, and sent her to the Women's Association, requesting them to do their utmost to help. Ms. Chen Zhenquan of the Association, after reading the petition, temporarily kept Hecui in the Association and notified her husband's family to come to the Association to reason with them.</p>
<h3>Infant Corpse in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:25 PM, Chinese Constable No. 33 of the Water Patrol Police Station recovered an infant corpse from the Huangpu River near the Longmao Wharf in Pudong. The head was facing downwards, the hands were crossed, and the body was completely unclothed. The skin was bluish-white and very swollen. It appeared to be an illegitimate child who had been heartlessly thrown into the river to drown in order to save face. The constable took the body back to the police station, pending transfer to the Lifesaving Bureau for burial.</p>
<h3>Man Floating in the River</h3>
<p>Soldier Rescued from Murderous Attack in the River</p>
<p>Escapes Death and Rejoices in New Life</p>
<p>Yang Zongjiong, the Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs Tongru Sub-Bureau, came to Shanghai from Nantong a few days ago aboard the Dada Company's Dade steamer. When the ship reached the mouth of the Yangtze River, Yang was taking a stroll on the ship when he suddenly saw a man floating in the river. He immediately instructed the ship's crew and others to pull the man out of the water. Upon examination, it was found that he was a soldier, and his hands and feet were bound. He was barely breathing and on the verge of death. Yang immediately performed emergency surgery to remove the water from his stomach, allowing him to regain consciousness and escape death. After the ship arrived in Shanghai, Yang instructed Fu Yu, a member of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, to take the man back to the team. During preliminary questioning by Chief Xu, the man identified himself as Qu Bing, twenty-six years old, from Guangxi. He stated that he was a soldier in the 61st Division of the National Revolutionary Army. A few days ago, he had boarded the Xinli steamer from Guangdong to go somewhere on official business. During the journey, he had a dispute with a colleague, who then had him bound, stole thirty yuan, and threw him into the river. Fortunately, Commissioner Yang saw him and rescued him, otherwise he would have drowned. The captain, recognizing that this involved an attack on a traveler, immediately prepared a document to be submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting that arrangements be made for the man's safety.</p>
<h3>Lost Woman Zhang Zhang Awaits Claim</h3>
<p>The Fourth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a lost woman, Zhang Zhang, to the General Bureau. According to the woman, she became separated from her husband in Shanghai. She is twenty-seven years old, from Wuxing County, and lives near the shipyard on Wujia Road, Linghu, Huzhou. She came to Shanghai with her husband, Zhang Puzhi, from her hometown at the beginning of last month to seek a living. Her husband works as a shop assistant in a Shanghai leather shop. She has not been able to find work and wanted to return to her hometown, but became separated from her husband on the way, resulting in her becoming lost. The woman has short, pointed hair, a long face, and is wearing a black cloth shirt with white stripes from a local factory, yellow wool pants, white socks, and blue checkered wool shoes. She has been sent to the Women and Children's Relief Association for temporary care, and a letter has been sent to the Wuxing County Public Security Bureau to investigate and notify her family to claim her.</p>
<h3>Prosecution of Counterfeit Wine Sales</h3>
<p>The French company Longdong, represented by lawyer Plumey, filed a lawsuit in the French Court stating that they had recently discovered that a Westerner named Tu Mengchuan, residing within the jurisdiction, was counterfeiting wine produced by the plaintiff's company and colluding with Win Si Deng to sell it. Therefore, they reported this to the police station, who searched the homes of the two defendants and seized three hundred and forty bottles of counterfeit wine. The counterfeit wine is now presented as evidence, and it is requested that the defendants be investigated for violating Article 39 of the Trademark Law and Article 269 of the Criminal Law, and that the private lawsuit portion of the damages, three thousand yuan, be recovered. The defendant, represented by lawyer Tibek, argued that the wine was actually purchased by the defendant Tu Mengchuan from a German named Jia in Tianjin from a consignment store and resold to the defendant. An invoice can be presented as proof. Therefore, Tu Mengchuan transported it to Shanghai and entrusted the second defendant to sell it on his behalf, not knowing that it was counterfeit. The damages sought by the plaintiff are excessive, and the defendants were not aware of the situation and were not the counterfeiters. Therefore, they should not be punished. A fair investigation is requested. Chinese and Western officials ordered them to leave and await sentencing.</p>
<h3>Arrested for Selling Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>Chen Sanlin, a detective inspector, and detectives Mao Jinsheng, Lu Jinchen, and Lu Jinbao of the French Concession Police Station, discovered that a certain store at No. 339 Aiduya Road was selling a type of lottery ticket, which violated the prohibition. On the previous day, they went to the store and confiscated several lottery tickets and some kudzu root that was being sold, and brought them to the police station, ordering them to post bail. The day before yesterday, they were summoned to the French Court for investigation. The head constable first appeared in court to explain the situation and present the lottery tickets as evidence. The defendant retained a lawyer to defend everything. Chinese and Western officials ordered them to await sentencing on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3>Fined One Hundred Yuan for Operating a Gambling Den</h3>
<p>Yu Ganquan and a woman, Wang Liu, were recently found to be operating a gambling den in the French Concession, enticing people to gamble, in violation of the prohibition. The case was discovered by a French Concession detective, who went to their respective locations and confiscated evidence of the gambling den and silver dollars. They were taken to the police station, and the day before yesterday were summoned to the French Court for investigation. The head constable first explained the situation and interrogated the defendants, who confessed to operating a gambling den. Chinese and Western officials sentenced the two defendants to a fine of one hundred yuan each, to be confiscated and used as a warning.</p>
<h3>Impersonating an Inspector and Extorting One Yuan</h3>
<p>Chen Jinsheng, a duck vendor from Songjiang, was arrested by the police and sent to court. Yesterday, Chen brought a boatload of ducks to Shanghai for sale. While traveling near the Xujiahui Cathedral in Shanghai West, Wang San, who works as a tea boy at a certain organization, suddenly impersonated an inspector from the Finance Bureau, claiming that taxes had to be paid and that Chen had evaded taxes and would be punished. Chen, anxious, pleaded with him. As a result, he was defrauded of only one yuan. However, while Wang was harassing him, a patrolman on the bridge saw it from afar and would not let it go. He came down from the bridge, stopped him, and searched him, finding the stolen money. Considering that he was harming the reputation of the municipal government, he was arrested and sent to the Second Section of the Sixth District, and then to the District Court for punishment.</p>
<h3>Child Killed by Car</h3>
<p>A child, He Guirong, only six years old, was walking on the road in the French Concession yesterday morning around 11:00 AM when he was suddenly hit by a car from a certain number and knocked to the ground. His head was crushed and bleeding profusely. Constable No. 64 arrived and hired a car to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, he died shortly after.</p>
<h3>Zhenhua Cotton Mill Careless Fire Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>At 11:40 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out in the ginning section of the Zhenhua Cotton Mill at No. 4 Lan Road, Yangshupu. Thick smoke and flames filled the air, and the situation was out of control. The Yangshupu Fire Brigade rushed to the scene and worked hard to extinguish the fire. It took about three quarters of an hour to put it out. Two ginning machines and cotton worth over seven thousand taels of silver were lost.</p>
<h3>New Lung Disease Medicine Proven Effective by Famous Doctor</h3>
<p>The new medicine for lung disease and hemoptysis issued by the Guosheng Domestic Pharmaceutical Company at A-1 Maijia Circle, Shandong Road, is based on a rare secret family recipe, using famous and precious Chinese herbs. It is manufactured by national physician Jin Fu Liu. It is effective in stopping bleeding, killing germs, suppressing coughs, and nourishing the lungs for conditions such as pulmonary tuberculosis, glandular tuberculosis, hemoptysis, blood vomiting, coughing, asthma, childhood tuberculosis, female tuberculosis, night sweats, etc. Each box sells for only two yuan. Qin Bowen, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Government Health Bureau's Chinese Medicine Registration Examination Committee and an internal medicine specialist, has repeatedly instructed his patients to try the medicine and has seen remarkable results. Therefore, Mr. Qin has written a letter of recommendation for the medicine to introduce it.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Siming Shipping Association</h3>
<p>The Siming Barge Coal and Stone Shipping Association of this port previously sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce regarding organizational issues, requesting review. Yesterday, the association received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, approving the reorganization and renaming it the Shanghai Coal and Stone Barge Shipping Trade Association.</p>
<h3>Payday Robbery Narrowly Averted at Arsenal</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Arsenal workers' wages, originally scheduled to be issued on the 5th of each month, were issued earlier for the month of September due to the Mid-Autumn Festival and yesterday being Sunday. Director Guo, out of consideration for the workers, arranged for the wages to be distributed on the 4th. The wages for the workers of the Longhua Arsenal branch, totaling over 25,000 yuan, were entrusted to the payroll committee member, accountant, and factory guard Xu Xibao, who carried the money in a self-owned No. 3 car to the Longhua factory. Unexpectedly, as the car passed a small wooden bridge opposite the Southwestern Yang Middle School on Longhua Road, another car carrying six or seven robbers suddenly drove towards them. One robber fired a gun and shouted for them to stop. The Arsenal car member and the guard Xu Xibao realized the situation was bad. Xu Xibao pulled out his pistol and returned fire, while instructing the driver to drive at full speed. After exchanging fire for about a minute, one robber was shot and fell inside the other car. The factory guard Xu Xibao sustained two bullet wounds to his right leg, but was not seriously injured. The robbers saw that the car was speeding away and difficult to approach, so they fled. The factory car drove straight to the Longhua factory, and the wages were not lost. The wounded factory guard Xu Xibao was sent to the Arsenal's military medical department for treatment. Director Guo was notified, and fearing there was an inside connection, he has sent men to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Soybean Cake Sales in Shanghai by Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>Seeking to promote domestic sales, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a letter yesterday from the Economic Investigation Bureau of the Harbin Chinese Eastern Railway, stating, "The daily necessities of the people in the Eastern Provinces rely heavily on foreign goods. This is a great problem. Fortunately, the region produces abundant soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean cake, with an annual export of 4.12 million tons to foreign countries, providing a much-needed source of revenue. In recent years, immigrants from within the country have arrived in large numbers, reclaiming barren land and increasing production. However, the foreign sales routes for soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean cake have suddenly become sluggish. At the same time, according to customs trade records, the amount of soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean cake imported into domestic ports from foreign countries is very large, while domestic exports are declining. The current situation is precarious. Thinking about the future, we are very worried. Our bureau, concerned about the difficulties of the times, has conducted extensive research and believes that it is necessary to adhere to the principle of agricultural division of labor, and to promote the domestic sales of soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean cake from the Eastern Provinces through transportation policies. At the same time, the Eastern Provinces can exchange domestic products for their daily necessities, so that both benefit and the outflow of revenue can be stopped. However, this matter is of great importance and has many complexities. Without knowing the truth, problems are inevitable. We should send personnel to conduct on-site investigations in the future so that they can be accurate and feasible. As we set out, we have long admired your chamber's concern for the country and its attention to economic matters, and we specifically list the following points to request your busy schedule for review, so as to provide a basis for progress. If it can be realized in the future, the country's economy and people's livelihood will truly benefit." Attached are the investigation points: (1) Does your port produce soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean cake? What is the production volume? Where is it sold? If there is no production, where does it come from? (2) What is the selling price per catty, per shi (please specify the weight of the shi), or per dan in silver dollars? What are the tax rates? What are the major fluctuations each year, and what are the reasons for the fluctuations? (3) What technology is used to convert soybeans into soybean oil and soybean cake (traditional methods or machinery)? What is the current manufacturing capacity of the city? (4) What are the common uses of soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean cake, and are there any new uses being invented? (5) Do farmers view planting as a main occupation or a secondary occupation? (6) What is the transaction method, and are there any groups or large-scale trading firms? (7) Are there any soybeans, soybean oil, or soybean cake from the Northeast that flow into the market? If so, what are people's comments on them? Is there a possibility of expanding in reality? If there are direct sales, can the capital be compatible? What are the transportation costs? (8) What products does your port sell to the Eastern Provinces? Are there any obstacles to sales? (9) What are the great opinions of your council on this matter? We have heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has already forwarded the letter to the Soybean and Grain Merchants Association for detailed investigation and reply.</p>
<h3>Request to Deduct Shanghai-Taiwan Relief Funds</h3>
<p>In the past year, Zhejiang Province held a relief donation campaign, ordering all merchant ships traveling in Zhejiang to collect a 10% relief donation on passenger fares. The Shanghai-Ningbo, Shanghai-Wenzhou, Shanghai-Taiwan, and inland river small steamers traveling to various ports in Zhejiang sent letters to the Navigation Association, explaining the difficulties of each line and submitting them to the provincial government. Representatives were also sent to Hangzhou to petition separately. Subsequently, the Zhejiang Provincial Civil and Construction Departments drafted measures, and the provincial government decided to consider the difficulties of each line and approved separate handling. The Shanghai-Taiwan line merchant ships carrying relief donations were allowed to deduct and return 10,000 yuan of donations already donated by the companies to the Taiwan Disaster Relief Association. The Navigation Association forwarded the letters to each shipping line and company to comply. Previously, the relief donations carried by the Shanghai-Taiwan line had exceeded 10,000 yuan. Therefore, a list of seven points requiring inquiry regarding the deduction of donations was presented to the Zhejiang Provincial Government by the Navigation Association on September 2nd for approval. Since the approval had not been received for a long time, a document was prepared yesterday to urge them. The bottom of the presentation is as follows: The presentation is for the purpose of urging and requesting a prompt review and approval of the measures for deducting the carried relief donations, so that they can be followed. The association previously presented a report on September 2 regarding the Shanghai-Taiwan shipping line merchant ships carrying relief donations, approved to deduct 10,000 yuan of donations already donated to the Taiwan Disaster Relief Association, because the donation situation of each merchant ship is different, and where the remaining donations after deduction should be handed over, which is related to the relief donations, so we have to be extra cautious. However, to this day we have not received a review and approval, so we continue to present this matter, humbly requesting you to inspect and approve it promptly so that we can comply and are extremely eager. Respectfully presented to the Zhejiang Provincial Government.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Silk Factories Closing</h3>
<p>Sixty-Five Out of Ninety-Seven Factories Have Closed</p>
<p>Over Thirty Thousand Male and Female Workers Are Unemployed</p>
<p>There are a total of 106 silk factories in Shanghai. Recently, the price of silk per dan has plummeted from over 1,000 taels to around 800 taels, greatly affecting all silk factories. Coupled with foreign competition, the sales of domestic silk have become sluggish, making it increasingly difficult for silk factories to maintain operations. As a result, more than half of them have been forced to close down one after another. According to a survey conducted by the Daily News, out of the 106 silk factories in Shanghai, 97 were surveyed. Among these 97, 65 have already closed. There are over 28,000 unemployed female workers and over 2,500 unemployed male workers. In total, over 30,000 male and female workers have lost their jobs due to silk factory closures. The remaining 35 factories that have not yet closed are also struggling. The following is a breakdown of silk factory addresses, female workers, and male workers:</p>

<h3>Approval for Tax Exemption on Products of Electrical and Silk Weaving Factories</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electrical and Silk Weaving Factories Association previously commissioned Accountant Pan Xulun of Lixin Accounting Firm to represent the association's factories and submit a petition to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The petition requested that various imitation foreign woven products be taxed according to the current regulations for machine-made imitation foreign goods to provide protection. The Ministry has now approved the submission of the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, allowing all of the factory's products, such as Guangya Tili, Ballaige, Xinhua Ge, Xiafei Ge, Xinhua Fang, French Crepe, Boro Crepe, Qi Xiang Crepe, and Xin Ya Jin, to be handled according to the tax regulations for machine-made foreign goods. That is, when these products are sold domestically, they will be subject to the regular export tax and the 2.5% surtax at the first customs checkpoint, after which they will be exempt from further taxes. Exports to foreign countries will be completely exempt from taxes to facilitate sales. This request for tax exemption for silk weaving factory products is unprecedented. However, other factories in the same industry can follow this precedent and submit similar requests.</p>

<h3>Sickness</h3>
<p>— Chun</p>
<p>Sickness is the most detestable thing, yet it has finally assailed me. Of course, I knew that sickness was lurking within a short period, and its signs had already forewarned me, but I only wished to avoid it and not be so entangled. However, the factual arrival of it ultimately violated my ideal, declaring that I am sick.</p>
<p>This is truly unfortunate. My family has all suffered the fate of illness. Even I could not escape. When I made eye contact with the sick, I felt a sharp, stabbing pain. My father is sick, my elder brother is sick, my second elder brother is sick, all groaning in bed, making the harmonious atmosphere of the whole family utterly desolate due to the gloom of sickness. Recently, my mother also fell ill from overwork in caring for them. Logically, I shouldn't have come to this bustling city to toil, turning a blind eye to the sick at home. However, in the end, for the sake of my own future, I had no choice but to leave this home filled with the groans of sickness and rush here and there. Who knew that before Heaven, my lurking illness would also break out, and I would also be groaning in bed?</p>
<p>Naturally, I don't even know what I am busy for, but I believe that there are always some things that are not solely for my own sake. Whenever I meet friends after only a month or so of separation, their first question is always, "Why have you become so thin?" This is partly a well-intentioned consolation, but on the other hand, how much agitation it gives me! Indeed, I simply don't understand why I have become so thin. Alas, so thin...</p>
<p>During this illness, the web of worries naturally bound me. I thought of the sick at home, and my thoughts became more and more troubled, and my spirit became more and more agitated. As a result, the burning fever increased proportionally, and my brain felt as if it were about to explode. The doctor couldn't help but be a little alarmed. Seeing my fever, he thought I might have typhoid fever. In fact, how could I have typhoid fever? Unexpectedly, the school took this as an imperial decree and immediately wrote a letter to my father—my sick father—with deeply hidden insinuations in the letter. How could this not worry my father, thinking that I was really that seriously ill? He asked many people to prepare a way for me to return. On the third night of my illness, two people came one after another. Fortunately, I had recovered slightly by then, or wouldn't it have turned a false alarm into reality? In the end, I sent them away. I believe that on this night, my family members—especially my loving father—must have been extremely uneasy.</p>
<p>The chills and fever have finally subsided. I was then eager to come out again. It turned out that in these few days of illness, I had caused many people to worry, even suspecting something unexpected had happened. When I went to Zhige's residence, he asked in surprise,</p>
<p>"We were just preparing to put an advertisement in the newspaper to find you."</p>
<p>"What? Isn't that too ridiculous?"</p>
<p>"It's been a few days, and we haven't heard from you at all. Everyone has been looking for you, but we can't find you. What have you been doing?"</p>
<p>"Don't you see my face? I'm sick! I could only barely manage to come out today."</p>
<p>After I said this, Zhige seemed to believe me a little, seeming to believe that his previous predictions were wrong.</p>
<p>But my doubts gradually grew stronger. I thought, "Why are they so worried about me?" So I asked Zhige,</p>
<p>"But you thought I was missing?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we thought you might be missing, because hasn't your recent talk been strange? And haven't your recent actions also been abnormal? It's been so many days since we last met, and everyone has been looking for you. Wouldn't that be strange? Today, the more we talked, the more we believed it, thinking that something unexpected had happened to you. If we didn't see you again today, we might really have put an advertisement in the newspaper."</p>
<p>"That would be quite interesting," I said with a cold smile. "No coincidence, no story." Alas, such a thing happened during this illness. It may not be an amusing tale.</p>
<p>Now, in this post-illness period, I know very well that I have not fully recovered my original health. But the driving force of this life does not allow me to enjoy the so-called opportunity for convalescence, and I must toil in this world. My father has sent a letter asking me to go home to recuperate, but in this situation, how can I possibly live a quiet life? Therefore, I have not complied with my father's good intentions. My sisters have repeatedly advised me to take care of my body. After seeing me after this illness, besides saying that I was terribly thin, they didn't seem to be able to say anything else. Wenzhi also earnestly told me to take good care of my body in these few days after the illness and not to run around recklessly anymore. But on the one hand, I gratefully accepted this comfort, and on the other hand, I have communicated their good intentions. In reality, I don't know what to do. As for the so-called source of life, how exactly should I pursue it? This is a difficult problem to solve. I only want to not make my life too empty and to at least complete a part of my life's mission, and this may perhaps be my "struggle for life." In that case, this illness is worth commemorating.</p>
<h3>Don't Scold People Without Investigation</h3>
<p>— Chen Baoqin</p>
<p>In the September 24th issue of the Japanese publication (Youth Garden), in Lu Xiangxian's article "The Person Living in the Pavilion," the content is nothing more than scolding women for not understanding the true meaning of love and only aiming for money. This is too generalizing. Of course, I wouldn't dare to say that all women don't love money, but we certainly wouldn't admit that all women are money-worshippers, more poisonous than snakes, and causes of ruin. Mr. Lu, if you had added a few quantifying words to the phrases like "women..." in your article, such as "a part," or "according to what I have seen," or even "most," "the majority," then I wouldn't have put down my serious books to babble on so much. But Mr. Lu's words are too generalized, too lacking in investigation, how can I keep silent and allow my fellow women to be slandered?</p>
<p>Now that Mr. Lu has generalized that all women love money, then I want to ask Mr. Lu, "Liang Hong and Meng Guang, raising the tray to eyebrow level" in the Han Dynasty has been passed down as a beautiful tale. Is Meng Guang not a woman? Is Liang Hong not a rich man? Furthermore, Zhuo Wenjun's marriage to Sima Xiangru was willing to sacrifice her original wealth to sell wine by the stove. Is Zhuo Wenjun a man or a woman? To take a more recent example, is Huang Huiru willing to marry Lu Genrong for money? There are countless other women who specialize in focusing on talent, learning, and sincere love, and despise money, I'm afraid you don't know them all. I can very frankly say based on the facts that love is by no means unconditional. The so-called "sincere love is unconditional" is deceitful talk, it is singing a high tune. If you say love is unconditional, why do spouses have to choose, and why is marriage autonomous? Isn't it to suit one's own conditions? Since love is conditional, then, women who have received considerable education, have a noble personality and thought, and have genuine knowledge, their demands on the other party are definitely not money. The main things are of course health, talent, learning, personality, thought, effort, and a spirit of progress. Meng Guang's love for Liang Hong and Zhuo Wenjun's love for Sima Xiangru are an example. Although Liang Hong and Sima Xiangru were a rice pounder and a poor man, they were able to sacrifice everything to love them, so they could respect each other as guests and love each other forever, because the conditions they demanded were permanent. But I absolutely cannot strongly argue that there are no dregs among women. There are indeed many who are among those we despise, such as women with generally unconvinced ideas, often hanging the signboard of female students, beautiful on the outside, rotten on the inside, in their minds, they only know fashion, decoration, extravagance, enjoyment, ease, indulgence, etc., fundamentally they do not know what is called love, so the conditions they demand of the other party, naturally, are nothing more than the various types mentioned above, whoever can supply it will go to love whoever, and men, they also use this weakness of women, so they try their best to obey, fearing they will not be able to reach their goal, to achieve their desires, but once the goal has been achieved, what is desired has been achieved, then they turn their original face, who will pretend again, pretending to be a rich old man, the so-called the wood is already a boat, the rice is already cooked, what methods do you have, to jump out of my fence, unexpectedly, it is not the same as it used to be, the old etiquette has lost considerable authority, there is a group of unfilial people - in the eyes of the believers of the old etiquette - who do not care about the three obediences and four virtues, the concept of chastity, and have to change allegiance to Qin in the morning and Chu in the evening, imitating to buy 　 - to divorce their husbands, this is indeed a clear and obvious fact, it is not allowed to deny, in fact, men's psychology, why don't they know that this kind of women are slaves of money, knowing that they are going to violate it, what must</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The results of inevitable failure, without adding them to their bodies, who else would they belong to, so, mercantilists, causes of ruin, poisonous snakes, vanity, snobbery, these beautiful names, one after another, are crowned on women's heads, this kind of one-sided harsh blame, is it not too much?</p>
<p>As for you saying that women's hearts are more poisonous than snakes, what is the basis, and how do you see that many men's hearts are not more poisonous than snakes? Women's personality and thoughts, can probably be higher or lower depending on the education and knowledge they have received, but in men, there are many who are good at hiding evil intentions, who are more difficult to observe than women, often very knowledgeable men, his despicable personality, and the means of deception, on the contrary, become more novel and more cruel with the transcendence of learning, try to open the history to see, women have been trampled on by men for thousands of years, it is not a special book, it is really impossible to write out the examples in it, from the monarch, to the people, there is no one who does not use policies to destroy women, or be abandoned because of having no children, or be abandoned because of the decline of color, not only destroy their bodies, but also hurt their hearts, most women are infatuated, once abandoned, they will be humiliated for life, as if they have lost the joy of life forever, this kind of abandonment, applied to innocent women, can be said to be extremely cruel, Shang Lingzi's "Separate Crane Play", Cao Pi and Cao Zhi's "Chu Fu Fu", are nothing more than mourning women who are unjustly 　 abandoned, there are also songs of being abandoned because of the decline of color and love in the poem "Gu Feng", these are all iron evidence of men's abuse of women, it can be seen that there was such a treasure before the Three Kingdoms, down to the Sui and Tang dynasties, this trend is even worse, Emperor Yang of Sui was licentious and immoral, indulging in women, to the extreme, once happy, forever abandoned, Bai Juyi's poem "Shangyang People" is to describe the suffering of palace people, since then, more and more plans have been made to create chastity, foot binding, polygamy, concubinage, no talent is virtue, to oppress women, this is even more unknown how many innocent women have been killed and wronged, plus the original old examples, it is really putting women so tightly bound that they do not dare to move at all, there is also the worry of disaster from the sky, now after our many struggles and struggles, we can only get a little bit of freedom, but at the same time, the trap is also set all over the world, to take recent facts as an example, although Huang Huiru herself has no learning, but she can not value money, break the concept of class to love Lu Genrong, this can also be said to be specializing in love as the goal, but Lu Genrong is ultimately a despicable personality, with deception in his heart, ungrateful, so that Huang Huiru died and was defamed, and was laughed at by the world, and in the past, Ma Zhenhua was not cheated by Wang Shichang, as in the latest case of a bigamy case, it is also the means of cheating to marry B, abandon A, he did not even think that when he pursued A, if A absolutely did not accept his request, how would he feel the pain of unrequited love and curse A, he can not say that he is a person without knowledge, from this it can prove what I said earlier, events like these are recorded in the newspaper in a few days, other events that occur in poor and remote places, and are not recorded, I don't know how many more there are, ah, this is originally the progress of mankind, poisonous snakes and beasts, harming people with ignorance is still the public enemy of mankind, people are the spirit of all things, all have compassion, now for no reason to kill and deceive a part of the same kind of men, is it not more poisonous than poisonous snakes and beasts, moreover, women's abandonment of men, mostly before marriage, men's abandonment of women, mostly after marriage, the loss is which is bigger or smaller, also no need to say, before marriage and abandoned, they will scold her for being more poisonous than a snake, then what should be scolded for being abandoned after marriage, as for those who are abandoned before marriage, can we conclude that the fault lies entirely with the women?</p>
<p>Speaking of the word cause of ruin, which one are you referring to, what disaster have women caused in this era, if you can find many examples in history, but there are also many traitors and thieves among men, compared to them, I am afraid that the disaster caused by men is even more than that of women, how can we say that women are the cause of ruin, in short, in general, there are dregs among both men and women, the bad of women, I have already said it myself, Mr. Lu, don't you think that all of you men are good people, there are certainly not a few who are infatuated, but there are also many people who change allegiance to Qin in the morning and Chu in the evening because of a moment of impulse and temptation, I hope Mr. Lu will think about it next time before scolding (Editor's Note) Mr. Lu's original work is entirely an objective description, not a subjective criticism, Mr. Lu described the wandering life of the bored young people living in the pavilion, humming Beijing tunes, talking about love, shouting poor, ...quite thoroughly, so it was selected and published, now, Ms. Chen has written this article to defend the women's side, this journal will of course also respect it, and publish it as above, to see the general opinion of the women's side on the issue of love,</p>
<h3>Overthrow the Idol</h3>
<p>— Wen Juan</p>
<p>Because I like to go to the remote places to study the customs of the people, so Yangcheng County, which is far away in the northern border, has my footsteps, this county, only three miles across the city, and there are only three city gates, the north gate is opposite the Daqing Mountain, scholars think that opening the gate will definitely offend the mountain god, so they specially built a high platform on the city wall, called Yangxiang Platform, commonly known as the North Platform, there is a Zhenwu General Temple on the platform, built very carefully, although it cannot be compared with the Da Zhao and Xiao Zhao in Guihua, etc., but it is already much stronger than the houses they live in, in addition to teaching affairs, I often go to the North Platform with my colleagues to change the air, and look at the scenery of the border, the Daqing Mountain is obscured in the north, the Great Wall is like a belt, tied across the waist of the Qing Mountain, there is not a single tree on the mountain, and the rocks are jagged, and the continuous and tall mountain, matched with the yellow sand below for thousands of miles, the howling wind of the Hu wind comes, there is another kind of tragic and magnificent spirit, not something that people who have lived in the south of the Yangtze River for a long time can understand, sometimes when the weather is clear and the sun rises, white clouds are like strands, lingering on the top of the distant peaks, like the Weaver Girl weaving brocade, looking at the slopes everywhere, there are countless white dots vaguely, appearing and disappearing and wriggling there, it is a picture of sheep grazing, sometimes the wind is smooth, you can also hear the flutes of the herdsmen, a Hanhaishi stone is embedded between the turrets on the platform, scholars say, one can see the faces of people a hundred miles away, just go to shine on the people, whoever is thought of in their hearts, can see whoever, but now the spiritual迹 has been pointed out, so it can't be seen, this kind of nonsense is not worth a laugh, but I have to study what is the origin of this kind of fallacy, so I have repeatedly gone to stroke this smooth as glass, brilliant stone, hoping to get some clues, but it is not successful, no reason can be found, later, I suddenly got a little news from many women, because in ancient times, they liked martial arts, Yangcheng was located on the border, and was suitable for the important point of war, the family with strong men often took pride in going out to join the army, so the spring boudoir has dreams, often on the banks of the Wuding River, every thought to find a way to see the face of their husband or children, people who like good things, then create this fallacy to fool women, maybe there are also people who rely on this stone to eat,</p>
<p>Since I have been in this small place, there is really nothing to do, the school building is "leaning in an ancient temple, there are only ten rooms in total, the Buddha statue occupies seven rooms, and the remaining three narrow and bad side rooms are the lecture hall of the women's school, the teacher's office has to entrust the building of the Buddha statue, I am a restless person, I can't help but feel disgusted with these clay sculptures and wood carvings, I often think of ways to remove them, at that time it was the spring of the Republic of China, the customs in the northern border were especially closed, although the provincial authorities said that they wanted to work hard to renovate, but their power was really not as great as the people, the total population of Yangcheng County is less than 100,000, but there are as many as twenty or thirty temples, it seems that all the material resources of the people have been provided to the idols, this is a fact that can never be found within the Great Wall, so I first convinced the county magistrate, and asked him to approve me to overthrow the idols, the county magistrate was a student who had studied abroad, and he was very smooth in doing things, in the end, he agreed to my proposal, and encouraged me to do it quickly, and he himself also promised to help me,</p>
<p>I went back to school and told the students and colleagues about the process, they all clapped their hands and rejoiced, and started to throw away the small mud dolls and beat them, in an instant the eyes were a lot clearer, but what about those big ones, they can't be pushed, they can't be shaken, what to do, we went to recruit workers to fight, but even if we paid a high price, no one came to apply, even the beggars refused, after ten days, we knew that hiring people was hopeless, but I, this stubborn person, would I be willing to give up like this when things have started, no, since the county magistrate has spoken, he should not go back on his word, making me in a dilemma, the result of seeing the county magistrate is that he allocated a batch of prisoners to the school, the wages were paid by the school, four corners a day, more than ten smoke criminals and destitute people were brought to the temple with iron chains, a thin and abnormal tall man opened his mouth first, "Sir, although we are criminals, we still want to cultivate the afterlife, we have suffered in the human world, and we don't want to suffer anymore when we go to the underworld, I won't do things to fight the gods, sir, you listen to them do it," for a time, the prisoners all hung their heads, as if each was calculating their own thoughts, "Don't be afraid, this has nothing to do with you, I called you here, all the misfortunes will be borne by me alone, and it has nothing to do with you," after they heard these very simple words from me, it seemed that they had already reached the heavens, and the worries on their faces were also reduced a lot, but several locals were still making excuses, or using their eyebrows to indicate that they did not want to risk this great danger, I was afraid that they would destroy it again, I looked at the faces of these people in turn, and saw that one of the Shandong people seemed to be more courageous, and also seemed to have a deeper resistance to fate, not believing that not fighting the gods would make his life better, and four corners a day, ten days is four yuan, after all, it is better than sitting in the sky, so he first explained to me that he could do it, but he had to take the money first, I was afraid that he would be slippery, the result of the discussion was that he would pay two corners first, and then take two corners when he left work, so seven or eight unwilling people all went back together, leaving five, and followed me to the East Hall to stand still, this is a place to worship miscellaneous small idols, except for the three sitting, the rest are standing, but only six feet high, in principle, it should not be very difficult to destroy, but the five people took the rope, and they seemed unable to start, I understood, so I walked up and first put the rope ring on the head of the clay man, pulled it hard, and turned back to the crowd and said, "Okay, this has nothing to do with you," they stumbled up and pulled for a long time, a clay man fell down, so they took it out and put it on the barren land in front of the school, half a day's work, only three were gone, and it was only a little more than ten o'clock, they were going to eat, they didn't come until two o'clock in the afternoon, and they all left at four and a half, they did this for several days, the East Hall was finally empty, but those clay corpses piled outside the school also had to hire a car to send them out of the city to be thrown away, the secretary went out to call the car and ran into a lot of nails, saying, "We are afraid of being struck by lightning and dare not pull," I used the old method to persuade them, they also refused, what to do, from the street to the school, a road has been like Shanyin Road for days, crowded with men and women watching the excitement, old women with crutches also came to see, all pointing and surprised at the encounter of the idols they usually worship, and their resentment towards me is as deep as the sea, some people say that I am the reincarnation of the devil, and some people say that it is also the time for the robbery of the gods, recently I was sent by heaven to beat them, the students were banned at home, not allowed to come and get close to me again, fortunately, the provincial government is enforcing compulsory education, the official department can use orders to urge students to go to school, I also asked the county magistrate for help, he had no way, so he had to call people to urge them from door to door, so my good students came together again, later I knew that even if they were not urged, their parents would also send them, because they were all making plans to go on a hunger strike at home, I don't know who taught them, probably their age, has reached the time when they can resist oppression, the high school students in the border, at least sixteen or seventeen years old, after the event, the county magistrate suddenly had a big banquet for his guests, some people found out that the content of his banquet was all to declare that the overthrow of the idol was initiated by the female principal, and had nothing to do with himself, we laughed it off when we heard it, after the teachers and students cooperated and buried the clay men in the open space next to the school, I also fought with them for half a year before leaving this border and returning to the mainland, after thinking about it, I can't help but laugh at my recklessness,</p>

<h3>Farewell</h3>
<p>— Mi Luo</p>
<p>——To my colleagues of two years——</p>
<p>Waiting for the bell to ring, only ten minutes remained. The watch in my pocket ticked away, its rhythmic sound clear and distinct. My heart, stirred by it, throbbed wildly, almost in time with the watch's mechanism.</p>
<p>Before me lay an indescribable dreariness. A ray of sunlight, hanging from the corner of the opposite building, seemed particularly weak today, reluctant to leave the corner.</p>
<p>"Tick-tock," the sound continued without pause. My heart, from its feverish throbbing, gradually calmed, then turned numb. But eventually, the sound of the bell startled me awake. I stood up as usual, left my desk, straightened my sleeves, and walked out of the office with a paper package, alongside my colleagues.</p>
<p>"This is the last moment," I thought. "I am about to leave my colleagues of two years." I had already walked out of the door. I wanted to say a few words of farewell to my colleagues, but I couldn't muster the courage. All I could do was nod as I usually did, and勉强say "goodbye."</p>
<p>Remembering the past two years, how could I bear to leave my many dear colleagues? Since I had walked through the bloodstains of life, braving thorny paths and breaking through adverse circumstances to come to Shanghai to study, barely graduating from a middle school, the burden of economic hardship had built up into a towering debt. In reality, it no longer allowed me to study elsewhere. At that time, with the introduction of a cousin, I entered this Shanghai Land Bureau as a trainee. Over the past two years, I have been treated with exceptional favor by the authorities, and have received the support of many, many colleagues, especially Mr. Li, our director, who treated me like a younger brother. He gave me guidance in my studies, encouragement in my work, and led me forward on the path of life with kindness and benevolence. I will never forget him, not even for a moment.</p>
<p>In my work, I have received sincere guidance from many colleagues, so I have not made many mistakes in the past two years, leaving behind a past history. Moreover, I was gradually promoted from trainee to assistant, and then to clerk. My salary also increased from thirty yuan to forty yuan to fifty or sixty yuan. In my impoverished life, this prevented me from experiencing cold and hunger, and the tuition for my evening studies was also obtained from here. Truly, unless I have already lost my conscience, how could I bear to leave this place so easily?</p>
<p>However, I am ultimately leaving this place, betraying earnest and insistent勸挽, and forging ahead regardless of everything. Have I truly lost my conscience? In this place, I have nothing but infinite apologies, and I simply have no words to justify myself.</p>
<p>Thinking that I am already twenty-two years old, I am so alarmed that I cannot have a moment of peace. In my young heart, I couldn't wait to grow up quickly, to be as tall and big as others. But as the years passed, since my father's death, and then my loving mother's passing, my elder sister's illness and death, and my younger brother's death in a hospital, all kinds of adversities came one after another, progressing at the same time as my life history. In ten years of weeping, I have already grown into an adult. Then, my anxiety also grew spontaneously, as if I had an unspeakable shame. I am already twenty-two years old, and people still ask me how old I am, unknowingly. I can only helplessly answer him, secretly blaming him for not being aware, making it difficult for me to answer.</p>
<p>Twenty-two years old has already arrived, and twenty-three years old will come soon. Every day passes in a muddle. What will be the result of my future? The era is in a state of constant flux, as if pushing waves and following the tide, and is in a state of continuous movement that cannot be stopped for a moment. In the blink of an eye, one will fall behind. Moreover, my knowledge is insufficient, and my ability is weak. How can the perfunctory actions of the present be a long-term plan? I am unwilling to admit that I am ultimately an incompetent person. I was originally endowed with a complete body and a little wisdom. How can I let myself down, let down those who expect so much of me? Therefore, the idea of ​​furthering my studies is constantly swirling in my mind. Finally, I resolutely decided that there is simply no other way except "I give up and strive to study."</p>
<p>I resolutely requested to the authorities, firstly, whether I could be allowed to work part-time and study part-time; and secondly, if I could not be allowed, I would resign.</p>
<p>The application was submitted, and the authorities repeatedly advised, saying that part-time work and part-time study were impossible, telling me not to study, and citing many precedents, "Advancement does not necessarily mean further education." I could only thank them for their kindness. In fact, I could no longer have any hesitation. I have to temporarily forget my feelings, betray my kindness, and leave, leave.</p>
<p>The dream of furthering my studies for two years has finally come true today. I only feel my own boldness. Carrying my schoolbag, I walked along Jiangwan Road. The autumn wind has already blown sharply. Touching my pocket, I still have enough to support myself for a few days. "Food, clothing, housing, and transportation are all indispensable," I thought, secretly measuring it.</p>
<p>Indeed, as the authorities instructed, "Education depends on one's circumstances." With my circumstances, the qualifications for further education have long been exhausted. However, I think that not being able to go to school because you don't have money is no different from wasting money when you have it. If I had a wealthy family, lived a life of luxury, and lived the life of a young master, I probably wouldn't have the thought of furthering my studies and making progress. It is precisely because I am poor, that poor children are willing to study. Everything in the world must wait until you have money before you can do it, and it is not necessarily possible to succeed. Only by gradually breaking through thorns can there be a smooth road to walk. I comforted myself in this way when I had no other choice.</p>
<p>From now on, I hereby swear,</p>
<p>"I will forever abandon my sorrow, not worth追維my past. I will turn my thoughts around and no longer sing about snow, moon, wind, and flowers. I will strengthen my consciousness, move forward and follow the banner of the Chinese nation. Let the northwest wind blow my body and tremble, but my bones have not been slackened in the slightest. Let my stomach be so hungry that I灌河water to fill my stomach, but my spirit has not been discouraged in the slightest. I do not expect personal enjoyment. There are so many people in this tragic era who are displaced. From now on, I will enrich my knowledge,鍛鍊my physique, prepare to ride horses and draw bows, and wait for the time when the Chinese nation needs me to sacrifice."</p>
<p>The downfall of the last resort was already predicted, and I am not surprised or sighed. Only the experience of life will not 空負my life in an extraordinary way. I painfully say goodbye to my many colleagues, and finally hope that each of us will work hard.</p>
