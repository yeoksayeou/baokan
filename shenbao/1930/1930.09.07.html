<p>江陰李鑑秋（復）先生。清季曾青一衿。家貧。擅換鵝術。於四體無所不精。故求者踵接。先生硯田所入。徐贍家外。悉以之辦學。及收買書畫古玩。故家無恒產。先生曾先後創辦兩學校。一爲化成中學。一爲商業中學。兩校歷年之經費。胥出於先生腕底。先生誠熱心敎育者也。</p>
<p>癸丑二次革命。東南騷然。先生之筆潤不無影響。因之是年歲底。積欠化成敎職員薪水二千餘金。及送灶日。猶無從籌措。敎職員均蒞先生家坐索。先生焦甚。不獲已。迺挾家藏唐太宗所繪之鷹六幅。走武進盛杏蓀處求售。旣至。輾轉倩人。進畫盛氏。盛睹畫。不言欲否。乃傳先生入。而詢畫之來歷。先生日。明以前不得而知。明時爲嚴嵩所有。及清。入大内。藏庋某宮。庚子之役。内府寳藏散失殆盡。此畫亦流傳出外。予於光緒季年。得之於金陵某骨董肆。盛氏聞言頻點其首。乃曰。此乃希世之珍。君旣得之。茲何以又願割愛。先生詳述所以。氏曰。君熱心可嘉。惟不識尙欠敎職員薪金如干。先生答二千餘金。氏立出三千金與先生。而留其畫。先生得之。稱謝而返。</p>
<p>顧先生誤會此舉係抵押。如有原欵。當可早晚還贖。蓋先生以爲雙方均未嘗言及畫値。二千餘金云者。係已急需之數。非索價也。而盛氏慨然與以三千金者。迺出於暫時濟急之美意。非多與代價也。因之翌年秋。先生籌得子母三千餘金往贖。詎盛氏訝然曰。此係買賣。烏可還贖。况物已贈人。故萬難如命。先生聞言大驚。急挽人再四說項。卒無效。惟氏允找千金。先生知不可挽。迺携金痛器而歸。歸而語人曰。早知如此。當初悔不一索相當代價。然其代價。豈僅値此區區三千金哉。言下不勝懊喪。此事迄今十餘年。先生猶未嘗去懷。每與人談及。時復聲淚俱下焉。</p>
<p>右述之事。係江陰盧素公先生爲予言者。盧李素相稔。且屬同道云。</p>

<p>廢歷中元。俗例有施放熖口之舉。一般僧侶。大忙特忙。其實藉此歛錢。以作迷信之宣傳而已。曾記中委吳稚暉先生有聯云。（替鬼化緣。或拜李。或求張。拾芝蔴凑斗。隨人作福。不爭多。不嫌少。儘蠟燭唸經。）又云。（哼兩句大衆聽聽。不因出色高僧。那得請他入座。弄幾文隨時用用。祗要有錢到會。何妨借此搭臺。）語近詼諧。入情入理。特誌之以實本談。</p>

<p>晨起屬稿。將寄自由談。適執友吳君致導來。一見標題。即笑曰。海上新聞。雖歷一秒鐘工夫。亦如恒河沙數。但何以於枕上得之。毋乃夢入邯鄲。借得盧生仙枕乎。抑如沈縱得玉枕於神授耶。余曰。不然。上星期二小病三日。親友及門之在滬者。咸來問訊。且各以近聞破悶。今日病起。彙而誌之如左。致導閱畢。亦謂可存云。</p>
<p>▲偏我來時　病之次日晡時。世好蔡伯民兄來。固不知余病也。憬然曰。前日惠臨。幸不共往三星觀魔術。余謂即往觀。亦不至於致病。曰否。非然也。是日君固不往。我醉心於張慧冲之水遁。且知三星表演僅此一日。即將移演於他處。銳意前往。觀客翹企亦皆殷殷。乃將及其時。台前忽懸一牌。謂水櫃玻璃破損。不能演。衆譁然。又以碎玻璃攤於台前。旋即閉幕。衆益囂囂。爭欲退票。卒不得要領而散。余笑曰。我倘偕往。則（偏我來時不遇春）之句。不讓君獨詠矣。</p>
<p>▲天女何來　姪婿唐頌元亦來相問。余曰。病當即愈。但苦無新聞以破悶。頌元曰。丈不言。幾忘之矣。近有自故鄉來者。（頌元杭州人）云下城某家有女。年八歲矣。性固靈敏。貌亦娟秀。但生有異相。父母閉置。不使見人。偶見至戚。咸覩其兩頰貼膏藥如錢大。杭俗迷信。其母近信巫者說。謂其生有自來。不可晦其眞相。於是不復深藏。頰上物亦開放。蓋左右頰有紋如花朶。枝葉皆具。且有盆盎。紋旣深刻而又有畫意。母更告人。謂徧身皆然。余笑曰。事不目見。固疑是妄語。頌元力證其有。然則此散花之天女。胡爲乎來哉。</p>

<h3 id="c113">羅馬敎廷對於中國禮俗之異議（下） <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 黎六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>此時在巴黎之穌派忽漸漸失足。一七○八年有名瑪勒布朗（Malebranche）者。發表一痛駡中國禮俗之著作。頗爲當時視聽所集。而羅馬方面亦全被多米尼加派把持。一七○八年之初有耶穌派神父勃洛哇那（Provana）歸自中國。持康熙帝之函。及以前對兩派的敎師所發宣言與仲裁等之筆錄。請見敎皇。敎皇克雷蒙十一非但不予接見。且旋即將一七○四年秘密發交駐華特使都爾侖誣衊中國禮俗之敎會正式公佈。</p>
<p>當時輿論對此糾紛不已之中國禮俗問題。極感興趣。各處議論紛紛。莫衷一是。敎皇爲了結爭端起見。又於一七一○年九月二十五日由敎廷裁判處下令凡未得特别許可而擅自討論此問題者。革除敎籍。此命令即最近羅馬敎廷裁判處再行認定其效力之命令也。事情之過去蓋已兩世紀於茲矣。據七月二十五日POsservatore　romano之紀載。謂近有多人懷疑此一七一○年之命令是否依舊有效。故敎廷各樞機大臣於十八日集議再行肯定其價値云。</p>
<p>觀此事經過。敎廷輕信一面之辭。對於中國傳統禮俗以武斷之態度任意誣衊。誠可惋歎。吾人於此當知多米尼加派與耶穌派之爭鬥。表面雖以宗敎問題爲名。其實乃法蘭西與西班牙在華政治勢力之爭。耶穌派在華成功之地位即法國在華殖民之基礎也。豈但西班牙人不願。羅馬敎廷亦恐在華敎權全被法人操縱。深感不安也。耶穌派因有法政府支持。故對敎皇之命令。熟視無睹。於此可見天主敎内部派别紛歧。所謂敎皇者亦徒有其名而已。</p>
<p>兩百年來天主敎在華勢力全受法國保護。與敎廷之直接關係甚少。近自意大利政府與瓦迪岡訂立條約後。敎皇因敎廷基礎較穩。頗有漸漸將在華天主敎勢力從法人手中收回之意。此一七一○年所下關於中國禮俗之禁令。何以忽然有人提起。何以敎廷再行肯定。内中當有幾許政治背景。决不能單作一簡單之宗敎問題觀也。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　翠竹淚斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>翠筠想想。凡事看爺面上。不必再和計較吧。前事固然可恨。到了現在。伊也膝下空虚。不曾生得一男半女。也是很可憐見的。誰知翠筠略爲自由舒服一點。又是一塲大病。他們曲院中人。最怕的是生病。本來飛箋召花。呌堂唱呌得很熱鬧的。一呌幾回。說是病還沒有好。那班客人就闌散了。或者便去另外換戶頭了。要是自已有小房子的。生病還可以生到小房子裏去。像翠筠那樣沒有小房子的。終日呻吟在一個亭子間裏。起初還有幾個客人來望望伊的病。但走進伊的屋子。一股藥氣。挾着一股病人氣息。先敎人難受。中國人的病室。老是把窗戶關得密不通風。因此室内空氣。愈加惡劣。再加病人的面黄肌瘦。皺眉苦臉。一副使人不愉快的面孔。人家也主不視爲畏途。所以到了這個下半節。别說有人去做花頭。連鬼也沒有上伊的門了。伊這一塲傷寒症。足足生了一個多月。但是下節的生意。不能不掙扎着蟬聯下去。倘要休息一節。這個開消。從那裏來。幸虧伊的病。漸漸兒好起來了可是病後容光。憔悴得不成樣子。連頭髮也似秋後的落葉一般。脫去了許多。頂上露出稀疏的痕來。人家誰肯花了錢。來看你的病容呢。支持過了一二個月。身體漸漸的復原了。反而比未病之前。出落重精神飽滿。生意也慢慢的恢復起來。在左詩晨遇到伊的時候。正是在伊病好起來的兩三個月。後來翠筠便嫁了一個人。這時候。左詩晨便不通音問了。原來翠筠所嫁的那個男人。也是上海的一個商人。他的原籍是寗波。却在上海倒也有年了。上海自從開闢了通商碼頭以來。有兩處地方人。最占優勝。他們在商界上各有其强毅的魄力。這兩處地方人。一處是廣東。一處便是寗波。廣東人雖然資產雄厚。長袖善舞。然而開疆闢。土簞路襤縷之功。却還遠不及寗波人。加着他們肯吃苦耐勞。往往一件青布長衫到上海的。不到十年工夫。居然是個商界名人。這是他們有勇於進取之心。起初自甘屈辱。到後來一得了勢。便伸長他的權力。因此很有許多出身不大高貴。譬如最先是當西崽。當馬夫。當駁船夫。但是他一有了機會。就能捉住了他這個機會。能爲我用。本來是（英雄不怕出身低）帝王尙有起自微賤原。何况是商人。</p>

<p>— 高偉</p>
<p>盈昻作</p>
<p>似乎一般的青年、對着過去生命的陳跡、總是懷着失望、或者是悲感的、他們的期望、無非要、過去的算是死了、把它葬入永生之門吧、雖則不免無限地追憶、畢竟在過去不如意的體騐中、感覺到缺陷的充塞、而計劃着以後的變更、在現在、青年對於文藝的態度、也彷彿是如此、大多數青年、關於現實環境的壓迫和束縛、誰都不能免掉、、爲要安慰這些搏戰的困苦、同時要給它們鐫下印象、就祇有文藝這條路是値得追求的了、祗有以文藝的形式的表現、來安慰、來彌補那某部份的缺陷了、這也並不是一種所謂取巧的方法、委實在這樣的時代中、只有文藝的容養、是能塡足了青年的理想的向上意志的要求、除了這條路、簡直可以說、没有第二條路可以供給他們、使他們在一度的疲勞後、立即恢復原有的生命之力、向着光明的大道前進、這也未始不是好的現象呢、</p>
<p>不過青年的作品、態度忠實的固然有之、但那往往是形成中國民族的、結、是因爲一時的牢騷、或一時的興會、青年的性情是好動所之、掇拾成篇的、也復不少、當我看了盈昻君這本（古骸底埋葬）的書目時、我就疑惑作者這本書或者也是流入了我上面所說的病態、因爲那幅淡描的封面使我無意間象徵着、固然、没有出於我的意料、在（小序）中得到了作者自已的供詞、他說、（也許那些影象永遠不會留下、若是常時没有筆、但是今日跑上爐鍋的就不是那些材料了、即使也有來的、也許不令這樣笨拙地倒下鑄範出來、所以此地埋葬的是古骸、）他的態度、只是（曾經有一個時候、因動了筆、不覺留下了字跡、字跡竟綴成了話句、在一些話句中、不禁演映了幾個故事的輪廓、）用這種態度來寫小說、結果很難得良好、我是希望作者今後要努力克服的、</p>
<p>這裏、是包含五個短篇、（史先生及其故事）、（一個外國人在中）、（從薄暮到黄昏）、（寺巷裏人物底消長）和（趣味底完成）、這裏的人物、以史先生的故事描寫得最好、</p>
<p>（史先生及其故事）是寫一個有趣的人物、他是地方的紳士、也當洋學堂理的國文敎員、並且做上海報的通訊記者、於是、當地社會上學界和報界裏史先生都佔得一個彷彿不小的地位、靠了洋學堂的勢力、可以不問了那新聞有否得罪人、因爲在混亂的當兒、是可以一些時蹲在這洋學堂裏洋房子間不出去、閑散閑散幾天、則凡百皆大吉、但事情眞怪、政府裏忽而逮捕史先生、使地方上的人忙着打電報營救、結果這次的逮捕、反是成了史先生的收獲、（怕這就是兩下的手段罷、政府裏不得已要一擒史先生、再行其這一縱而牽絡的手段、史先生一清產委員、政府没有什麽損失、然而經受者却得了許多便宜了、）</p>
<p>史先生爲人是很識時務的、清產委員會不久、就鬧了意見、意見的發生是委員們搶去了史先坐的生意、但史先生也豁達、他敌道尙有許多地方隨處微留點勁兒很可以彌補而有餘多多、何必斤斤於此、其次、他的頭腦不但不冬烘、而是很新、雖然也是秀才、他贊成男女同學、甚至和那些古董在開會時摔過墨盒、他能講講（洋涇浜）、稱自已夫人（從前也是一位恬恬呌的蜜司啦、）他　學生的脾胃、知道學生的心理、（能馬虎就馬虎、）不過莫要惹起了他老先生的惡感、除此之外、史先生的記者經騐也很者到、自從吃了那次被逮的敎訓、史先生發出的消息、不惟不得罪上司、有時還夾幾句恭維、於是兩得其利、更何樂而不爲、而且、因着敎會的關係、史先生能續弦三次呢、所以一句說、史先生是聰明的、</p>
<p>然而、革命的潮流終於弄成了、一個驟然巨變、革命軍旗幟的飄蕩、史先生也成了當地的在被革之列的（四大金鋼十八羅漢）和（十三太保五小鬼）之流的人物、幸而史先生當時逃得快、所以就没有被革掉命、</p>
<p>算算史先生逃亡大約兩百日的光景之後、仍復能夠回來、回到故鄉、不過據說現在却没有敎書、也没有做記者、紳土名目乃爲被革掉了的、想史先生没有做那個、但不知什麽時候史先生再能弄得個委員兒做做呢、這是比從前時髦得多了、（二八頁）</p>
<p>那末史先生終於還有重振旗鼓的一日吧</p>
<p>像史先生這樣大同小異的人物、以我個人所見到的、到也未始不是以拿數目字來替代、尤其我故鄉的情景、在這次革命的驟變中、如果要我找相類史先生的人物、眞是一件極容易的事、我有時在憤極之餘、曾極力想懇定地找住這些人們熔合在創作中、替他們留下一個痕跡、同時促一般的反省、但迄未完成、委實是憾事、現在讀到了這篇、也姑算是代鳴了我心頭的蘊藏、</p>
<p>（趣味底完成）這篇、我也很愛好、他寫一個没有得到好照應的女人的男子、爲要使生活舒服一點、能安心做事、便想法討妾的心理、感應很有力、本來在全書中、作者的心理描寫並不多、大都僅是用行事來反映出人物的心理狀態的、而這裏却轉入於深刻的心理描寫了、</p>
<p>（開始進入春天的門、看見了閃爍不靖的曇雲、曇前的寄托、就是某也得弄來做妾的人、這是苦了半生的醞釀結晶、心裏祝願曇雲是歷刦不變的結晶品、能夠伴着自已一生、（一一○頁）</p>
<p>這把一個熱烈地期待着幸福的追求的人、完全赤裸裸地暴露出了、</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>其次、在從（薄暮到黄昏）中的那個老者、我也很愛好的、不過、這個老者眞是太純東方式了、他只知道平凡地生、生以至於死、絶没有（向上的意志）與（創造的慾望）在要表現我們民族精神的現代、似乎這種人物是不必要表現的因爲我們對於生、不僅是生而已、更應富有生命的意志、那未民族的生命也能堅强了、假若我們的生、祗是機械的、無生氣的、試問、有甚意思呢、</p>
<p>因爲作者是用（字跡綴成話句）的態度來寫的、所以每篇都有一種潦草的狀態、就是、文字雖則是結束了、却後文還有許多是値得去憶想者、作者是不寫下去了、結搆方面因此不能完整、而又有文氣不順之嫌、如果能用忠實的態度來寫、我想不至於有此種結果罷、</p>

<p>— 湯彬</p>
<p>事實已經很顯然地詔告於我們、提倡民族主義文藝是當前不可稍有遲緩底事、在所謂一盤散沙的中國、祗有此項合乎時代潮流的文藝、是今後研究文藝的進路、因爲它、是已有悠久歷史底背景、誰也曉得、我們中國負有五千年先進的文化、在先前對於世界諸國的學術界、實有不少底貢獻、即如最早最可靠的詩選集丨詩經、在那時已意識着極其深刻的民族思想、這是一般學者所公認、因此、提倡民族主義文藝於思想界紊亂頽廢不堪的目前中國、委實是具有大極廣泛的意義、誰也應該懽忭鼓舞地歌頌它底勃興、所以自發揚民族主義文藝最有力的（前鋒周報）出版以來、國内的文壇頓爲之一振、在學術進展與刋物的勃興、大有一日千里之勢、單就文化中心的上海一地而言、繼之而起的或影響到已有多種、如指導學生論理透澈的（時代青年）、側重創作消息敏捷的（草野周刋）等等、都是以民族主義爲努力文藝的中心、其它、各地、也有不少關於此項文藝刋物之產生、尤其以氣象煥新的我們底首都爲最、這對於現今愈趨落後的中國學術界底前途、實顯耀着無限光明燦爛的希望、中國文化底重興、在世界文壇上放一異樣的光彩、可以斷然地預料、這是在不久以後的事了、</p>
<p>我現在要介紹於愛好文藝讀者之前的這本（長風月刋）便是最近首都出版界所出現的刋物之一、</p>
<p>在思想混亂到不堪情狀的中國出版界、有許多專力於文藝的學者急須將它清理一下、實不仍使之長此紊亂下去、所以在目前所出版的大小刋物、在實質上都把握着一貫的中心思想、將自已所主張的、信仰的、很顯明地向讀者澈底的表揚、劃清自已的戰陣、這就是肅清混亂不堪的思想初步、所以這本以（介紹世界學術及發揚民族精神爲目的）長風月刋、便也負起它對於文藝上的使命、在開端、對我們即明顯的表白了、同時、它也論及於政治、但是文化與政治實發生嚴密的聯擊、不能分離的、這是事實、</p>
<p>人類數千年的文化史、是思想的產物、二十世紀的新發明　新科學、也無一不是思想的產物、人與其他動物的分野、即是前者思想活動的範圍大、後者思想活勸的範圍小、民族的興衰、文休化的優劣、與夫政治的良窊、都爲人們的思想所决定、海格爾（Ｈeael）說、（思想的權威、烈於地獄的猛火）、是騙人的話嗎、</p>
<p>這的確是警切之語、原來（動物有智力、但不及人的智力的偉大、）如果我們要求國家之强盛、非從所屬國的民族文學上努力着手不可、所以提倡民族文藝運動、是不能再遲緩了、因爲這種（長風月刋）所誠意的負起兩種偉大的使命、我們實有詳知的必要、</p>
<p>我們眼見中國思想界紊亂頽廢的不堪、又明知道祇有從學術的立塲才可以整理紊亂頽廢的思想、所以我們不得不致力於思想的整理運動、本刋發行的動機、即是懷胎於此、本刋負有兩個重大的使命、一是介紹世界學術、二是發揚民族精神、中國不但產業落後、學術也是如此、學術飢荒的危險、比物質飢荒的危險更大、别人的學術一日千里、我們若不迎頭趕上、不僅永遠落於人後、且將無法生存、因爲現在生存競爭、愈演愈烈、競爭的武器、即是學術、有學術者生、無學術者死、學術進步者勝、學術幼稚者敗、帝國主義在華八十年來的侵略、何以我們不能抵抗、而任其宰割、不是因爲他們的學術强於我們嗎、不然、同屬人類、何以他們有組織、有計劃、遇事能運用科學方法、而我們不能、中國人不發奮圖强罷了、若想取消次殖民地的徽號、一洗八十年來的奇恥大辱除力謀學術發達以外、旁的没有辦法、</p>
<p>我們是中國民族、當然不應該忘記了中國的文化、更不該坐視中國的文化長此淪落、陷於永不振興底狀態、同時、我們要犧牲點可貴的腦力、尋找出中國文化雖有五千多年的歷史、怎樣不能跳躍於世界前頭的因果、關於此、上面所徵引的一段語、便替我們解釋得透澈而無遺漏了、又好似針針見血、一字一句都打動中國一般學者與愛好文藝青年底心坎、激起發奮努力發揚中國民族文學的心、但是我們要曉得、現今已到了（千鈞一髮）的時代了、有如熊熊的火把在後焚燒、前面的人不得不豪勇地振起精神向前衝去、你再躊躇着不進嗎、那麽、你不但不能安穩地站住、而且要發生生命的危險、</p>
<p>其次、該刋將所負的兩種使命、更有詳盡的說明、爲了本刋的篇幅關係、祗有棄諸介紹世界學術這方面的、單徵引它所要完成的第二個使命、但是它所論之點非常精審而澈透、在我們愛好於文藝者、又不得不一讀爲快、因爲它、有許多地方是足努力於民族文藝者底參考、希望讀者靜心的看吧、它是這樣的强有力的發揮着、</p>
<p>本刋的第二個使命、是發揚民族精神、國家主義、固不足以爲訓、民族精神却不能不盡力發揚、民族與國家不同、大家知道、無庸解釋、中國民族在歷史上曾放過特殊的光彩、中國民族對於人類文化的貢獻、已爲全世界學者所公認、但中國民族自鴉片戰爭以後、逐漸淪於次殖民地的地位、幾有朝不保夕的趨勢、爲什麽弱到這個樣子、致弱的原因、至少在半打以上、但最大的一個原因即是民族精神的喪失、這一點總理在三民主義中講得很詳、民族精神是民族文化的骨髓、如果民族精神不能發揚、民族文化必隨之枯榴、……甘地對於印度民族的犧牲、凱木爾對於土爾其民族的貢獻、他如朝鮮·安南·菲筆賓與波斯各民族的獨立運動、都是民族意識發達的表現、這種運動是各民族求自由平等的呼聲、是全人類找光明和實現正義的表示、凡物不平則鳴、各民族間如不能打被壓迫與被壓迫者的鴻溝、人類决不會有安全的一日、可見各民族努力以求解决、確是自救救人、因爲民族主義的精神、與國際主義的精神原無二致、民族主義是國際主義的根基、祗有國家主義才是國際主義的仇敵、所以發揚民族精神、不但是一民族解放自身的手段、同時又是促進人類大同的先聲、</p>
<p>該刋的宗旨與及應完成的任務、我們都有明顯的了解、現在、須考察它底内容了、但思想的統一、把握着民族的中心意識、已是必然的而毋庸贅述、其分（專論）與（文藝）而欄、上者共有巨著六篇、下者包含詩學小說計八章、翻譯創作並重、始適合該刋所負的兩種偉大的使命、在（專論）欄内、也有討論到關於科學、敎育、與青年問題的、都是精密之巨製、使我們讀者得益不少、最後附有雜感三篇、亦頗有尖剌之風味、</p>

<h3 id="e1">He Jian Pursues the Communist Bandits <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Li Jue and Chen Guangzhong Serve as Pioneers</p>
<p>Having Passed Tiaoma Stream and Langli City</p>
<p>(Hankou) Military News: He Jian ordered Li Jue and Chen Guangzhong's two brigades to serve as pioneers, pursuing the Communist army. The Gong and Luo Divisions followed closely behind, having already passed Tiaoma Stream and the Dongshan line of Langli City. He reported to Hankou via telegram on the sixth, and the Good Offices Committee also telegraphed He Yingqin, requesting the dispatch of more troops and airplanes for joint suppression. Representatives have been appointed and will come to Hankou in person for a detailed report. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Military News: Peng Dehuai, Huang Gonglue and others are still in Langli City, preparing to retreat to Liuyang. He Jian is pursuing them in three routes, and heavily garrisoning Changsha. The vanguard of the 18th Jiangxi Army Division has arrived at Zhuzhou, launching a pincer attack towards Liling. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Changsha) The Communist bandits fled past Zhentou City. The right wing of the National Army pursued past Dongshan, and the left wing has crossed the Liao Hu River, pursuing to Gaoqiao. Chen Guangzhong reported that Zhu De is indeed dead, with a full beard on his face. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Changsha) Peng Dehuai, Huang Gonglue, Zhu De, and Mao Zedong's thirty regiments launched a full-scale attack on the province, engaging in a bloody battle for six days and nights. Our right wing, Chen Guangzhong, Tao Guang, and others, exited Dongjingpu, taking a shortcut to Dongshan. The left wing, Luo Lin's troops, bypassed Laodao River and emerged from Leigong Ridge, killing nearly ten thousand bandits. On the evening of the fourth, the bandits made a general retreat towards Liuxi's Yong'an City. National Army Brigade Commander Chen Wo, and Regiment Commanders He Yunlong and Wan Fangzhi were all injured. The officers and soldiers suffered over a thousand casualties. There are reports of Zhu De being wounded and killed. The Post-War Affairs Committee recommended Chen Jieshi to go to Hankou to request He Yingqin to quickly lead heavy troops and airplanes to Hunan to suppress the bandits. (Special dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military News: The bandits disturbing Hunan were initially very rampant. Later, intimidated by the power of the naval guns, they ultimately did not dare to invade Changsha. Currently, the Xianning and Yong Sheng warships are both protecting the army as they advance to pursue and suppress the bandits and patrolling between Xiani Port and Mingjia Bay. The other day, the Yong Sheng warship was protecting the army's river crossing at Dongzhi Port and then sailed down to patrol to Shidie Ridge when it encountered a large group of Communist bandits probing the Monkey Stone area. The warship immediately launched a fierce artillery attack, killing countless bandits. Later, the bandits retreated towards the Datoupu area, and the ship immediately opened fire, scattering them. As of the 6th, all bandits along the river from Leopard Ridge to Xiangtan have been completely wiped out. (6th telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) British Legation News: The Changsha Communist army scattered and is no longer an army. The Shashi Communist army has also scattered. The Yangtze River is expected to see a period of peace. All foreign nationals have been ordered to return to their residences. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to a telegram from Changsha, He Jian's army is in a favorable position. Since the afternoon of the fourth, the Communist army has been retreating from the Dongshan area of Langli City towards Liuyang and Liling. The city has returned to stability. Some military officers were injured, and there were over a thousand soldier deaths and injuries. The Communist army suffered over six thousand deaths and injuries. (6th Central News Agency telegram)</p>

The situation is extremely rampant, approaching Hukou, downstream of Jiujiang. An urgent telegram states that the area is in danger. The entire 297th Regiment of the 50th Division, stationed along the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway in De'an, arrived in Jiujiang today and is advancing towards Hukou.

<h3 id="e3">Telegram to Chiang, Declaring His Attitude <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Stating He Will Summon Gu Weijun and Others Back</p>
<p>Zhang Qun Also Sent a Telegram Reporting</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang telegraphed Gu Wen, Head of the National Government, on the sixth, stating, "I recently received a telegram from Commander Zhang in Shenyang stating that Brother Yuejun forwarded your telegram. Understood. Recent rumors are rampant, and I cannot refute them all. You, in your wisdom, can discern the truth. Shen Honglie's matter is beyond reason and logic, and no explanation is needed. As for Tang Erhe, Gu Weijun, Luo Wengan, and others, they have recently been traveling between Beiping and Tianjin for personal matters, which is true, but it cannot be said that they have any purpose. I have already ordered them to return quickly and have taken measures to dispel rumors to avoid confusing listeners. Respectfully reported," etc. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Qun, Fang Benren, and Wu Tiecheng telegraphed Gu Wen, Head of the National Government, stating, "Recently, it has been widely rumored in Beiping that the Northeast has agreed to the establishment of a puppet government in Beiping. Commander Zhang is concerned that the rumors are untrue and will cause misunderstanding. Today, he specifically telegraphed Yan Xishan, stating, 'Respectfully, Mr. Yan Baichuan of Shijiazhuang. I received the Eastern telegram from the Enlarged Conference, learning of the establishment of a government in Beiping and the nomination of Xueliang as a member. Upon investigation, Liang was not consulted about this plan beforehand, and due to various reasons, I cannot assume the position of committee member. Respectfully reported, Zhang Xueliang (stamped),' Shen Honglie also telegraphed Beiping on the same day, stating that he was not involved in the matter. Gu Weijun, Tang Erhe, and others have also been recalled to Shenyang. The Northeast supports the Central Government consistently. Please forward this to the officials of the Central Government and send a telegram to all parties to clarify the truth. We implore you, Zhang Qun, Fang Benren, Wu Tiecheng (stamped)." (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Shen Honglie telegraphed Jia Jingde and Xue Dubi, stating, "Apart from my duties in the Northeast, I am not involved in any other matters. However, there are rumors of me becoming the Minister of the Navy, which is extremely alarming. Please investigate and inform me of the truth." (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Central representatives Zhang Qun, Fang Benren, and Wu Tiecheng visited Zhang Xueliang at 9 pm last night due to Zhang Xueliang's recent attitude. Zhang replied, "Not only have I not joined the North, but today I merely sent a telegram to Yan Xishan questioning why the Enlarged Conference appointed me as a member of the government without consulting me. My relationship with the North is only this much. Gu Weijun and others are afraid of causing misunderstandings, so I have ordered them to return to Liaoning from Beiping. My support for the Central Government is unwavering." The three representatives left satisfied. (6th Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Local Peace and Tranquility in Shashi <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>

<p>(Nanjing) According to a report from the Navy Department, the Communist bandits attempting to disturb Shashi were subjected to a fierce attack by the Desheng warship and have been defeated. The remaining bandits fled towards the Beishayang area. Shashi is now as stable as usual. The bandits who appeared at Huangsang Estuary were attacked on the fifth with the cover of the Chu Guan warship to land the army in Chenjia Estuary to supress the bandits. The bandits resisted, but after the ship opened fire and fiercely attacked, many bandits were killed. The remaining bandits fled to Yunshan, and all the bandit dens at Huangsang Estuary have been destroyed by us. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e7">Indian Peace Talks Fail <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Generally speaking, the word "peace" is ten thousand times more difficult than war and strife. Therefore, if a problem arises from strife and war, there is absolutely no possibility of peace talks. If there are peace talks, it must be after strife and war, when the outcome has been decided and one side has completely surrendered. Therefore, the success of peace talks in the past has always been due to the success of one side, and there has never been a fair peace. The reason for the initiation of the Indian peace talks was that the Indians thought that they could achieve their freedom and independence without more intense struggles, so it was okay to start peace talks. The British thought that they could avoid strong suppression and restore peace within the country, so the peace talks were beneficial and harmless. But in reality, the Indians must want to break away from British management and gain independence, and the British are determined not to give up the management rights of India. There is absolutely no compatibility between the two. To establish peace talks between the two, the Indians must fight and completely defeat the British, so that the British cannot but fulfill the wishes of the Indians, or the Indians cannot defeat the British and are still conquered by the British, thus fulfilling the wishes of the British. Therefore, the failure of the Indian peace talks this time is expected by everyone.</p>
<p>However, the failure of peace talks often turns into an increase in the power of struggle. This is something that can be verified by past events. Will India's anti-British actions be more intense in the future?</p>

The enemy on the front, Shi Zhenqing, Deng Baoshan and other troops, have no will to fight due to insufficient supplies. Three: The remaining enemies in Taikang and Suixian rely on danger and resist desperately.

After five hours, the stronghold was destroyed by more than seventy percent. The army's pre-selected commando team took advantage of the situation to launch a fierce attack and went straight up in one fell swoop. The enemy was driven to a desperate fight, engaging in close combat, street fighting for an hour. The enemy was terrified because the fortress was broken. They were forced to surrender their weapons and were all captured. In addition to the hundred or so enemy officers and soldiers and dozens of war horses killed in the earlier and later stages, the results of the battle included the capture of more than 400 officers and soldiers including the regiment commander Li Lingyu and the regiment deputy Li Liubang, more than 300 war horses, 320 rifles, more than 60 submachine guns, and more than ten pistols.

<p>Negotiations Ultimately Fail</p>
<p>Revival of Salt Law Violation</p>
<p>▲ Minimum Requirements of the Indian People</p>
<p>Support the Establishment of Responsible Government</p>
<p>Restriction of Special Rights of the British</p>
<p>▲ Reuter, Pune, 5th - After reviewing the correspondence regarding the failure of the negotiations, it is clear that the leaders of the National Congress insist that Britain must recognize India's right to secede from the British Empire before a satisfactory resolution can be reached. The key point is that India must have a complete national government responsible to the people and controlling the national defense forces. The leaders of the National Congress also demanded that all British rights and concessions, including Indian public debt, that could be considered unfair, be adjudicated by an independent court. If the above conditions are accepted by Britain, the non-violent resistance movement can be declared cancelled, but the picketing of foreign cloth shops and hotels, and the private production of salt, will continue. The leaders of the National Congress also have other demands, such as the release of non-violent political prisoners, the return of confiscated property, the repayment of fines, the reinstatement of township officials who have resigned or been dismissed, and the abolition of various special laws. Furthermore, the above requirements are prerequisites and must be resolved before the organization of the London Round Table Conference and the Indian delegation can be determined. Governor-General Irwin replied that he was dissatisfied with the National Party's arguments and that such proposals were impossible, so detailed discussions would be fruitless. If the non-violent resistance movement is indeed cancelled, special laws will naturally be revoked.</p>
<p>▲ The Course of the Breakdown of Negotiations</p>
<p>Sapru and Jayakar Jointly Publish an Article</p>
<p>▲ Reuter, Pune, 5th - Mediators Sapru and Jayakar jointly published an article recounting the course of the failure of their negotiations, stating that the origin of the talks began with a conversation between the former President of the All-India Congress, Motilal Nehru, and a correspondent of the London Daily Express, Mr. Slowcomb, on the 20th of June. Mr. Slowcomb drafted clauses based on this conversation, which were agreed to by Nehru, including the requirement that the British government provide an informal guarantee to support India's fully responsible government, with conditions for mutual adjustment and transfer methods. Nehru was willing to convey this guarantee to his son (Pandit Nehru) and Gandhi. Gandhi sent a letter to the mediators, instructing them to forward it to Nehru and his son, arguing that the London Round Table Conference should only discuss the necessary safeguards for a fully autonomous government during the transition period, but the issue of independence should not be removed. Nehru and his son replied together, reiterating the demands contained in the resolution passed at the Lahore National Congress annual meeting on December 29th (i.e., complete independence). Pandit Nehru sent another letter to Gandhi, containing words such as "I prefer to fight." Finally, everyone met in Yerwada Jail in mid-August. As a result, Gandhi gave the mediators a letter containing the National Party's conditions. The mediators later showed Motilal Nehru a letter from the Governor-General rejecting them, and he was quite disappointed. Today, Gandhi spoke to end the negotiations, saying that the nation has not seen any room for connection between the government and the National Congress, and that since both the British government and the public recognize India's right to secede as impossible and unacceptable, the National Congress has no choice but to continue fighting for freedom.</p>
<p>▲ Various British Newspaper Commentaries</p>
<p>▲ Reuter, London, 6th - The Indian peace talks are the most important news in this morning's newspapers, and many have written articles discussing the matter. The London Express believes that the matter can still be accomplished with the wisdom of both sides. The newspaper advises the British government to explain that the convening of the Round Table Conference is intended to arrange everything for an autonomous India with the necessary temporary safeguards, and that the Round Table Conference is not limited to the scope of the Simon Report. The newspaper also advises the National Congress to revoke the non-violent resistance movement and participate in the Round Table Conference based on this commitment and the condition of amnesty for political prisoners. The Times stated that the demands made by Gandhi and the Nehru father and son in their letters from prison to the Governor-General directly demanded the complete surrender of the British government, and that such conditions would be more appropriate if they came from the leaders of a military revolution that was half successful. It also said that it is desirable for the National Congress to join the Round Table Conference, but the attendance of representatives from the National Congress is not indispensable. The government and its collaborators can continue to prepare for the London meeting with a clear conscience. The Morning Post hopes that the government, after the experience of failure, will turn to serious business, namely, governing India and restoring peace. The Daily Mail stated that we in India must either govern it or abandon it, and we do not want to abandon it.</p>
<p>▲ Reuter, Bombay, 5th - The revival of the movement to violate the salt law on Chowpatty Beach is a commemoration of Gandhi's fourth month in prison. Crowds gathered there to witness the salt production work. At the same time, students at Wilson College ignored the principal's ban and raised the national flag.</p>
<p>▲ Reuter, Islampur, Bombay, 5th - Four thousand people from the village of Birashi and surrounding areas held a meeting in a desolate forest. Two hundred and fifty policemen rushed to disperse them. A conflict broke out between the two sides. The villagers resisted the police with sickles and bricks, injuring six policemen, but two villagers were killed and several injured. The police, led by a local official, marched twelve miles at night to reach the desolate forest and saw the villagers holding a meeting under the national flag. The local official initially planned to persuade them to disperse, but the crowd responded with stones. The police initially used batons to disperse them, but the crowd scattered and then gathered again. The police then opened fire and arrested many people, including several wealthy merchants. The situation is now calm. It has been found that local tribes have recently incited the people to engage in non-violent resistance.</p>
<p>▲ Reuter, Lahore, 5th - A person serving in a newspaper has been arrested in connection with the murder of Police Chief Teghart in Calcutta on the 25th of last month. It is reported that the police, based on his confession, seized fourteen bombs.</p>
<p>▲ Reuter, Bombay, 5th - Sirajuddin and Abdullah Mah, were today sentenced to seven years each of imprisonment, for involvement in the bombing of the Byculla and Masjid stations on April 12. The first blast occurred on a local train bound for Bombay, and the second blast occurred in the third-class waiting room at Byculla station, killing and injuring a total of two people.</p>

<p>▲ Kokumin, Geneva, 5th - The Eighth European Minority Nationalities Congress convened today and sent a letter to French Prime Minister Briand, stating that his European Federation plan neglects the principle that any European</p>
<p>union plan must be based on nationalities rather than states. The letter concludes by imploring Briand not to devote all his efforts to increasing the interests of the various states, but to increase cooperation and goodwill between the various nationalities based on the principles of equality and fairness.</p>

<p>The Morning Post Loses Lawsuit Due to Insufficient Evidence</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin, Berlin, 5th - The Morning Post is one of Germany's most famous newspapers, with a circulation of between six and seven hundred thousand. Its editor-in-chief, Montair, was today fined 1,500 marks for being accused of damaging the reputation of the deposed Emperor. Montair immediately filed an appeal. The newspaper previously published an article stating that the deposed Emperor was a hidden shareholder in the Krupp Armaments Factory, so Krupp enjoyed a monopoly on German armaments, causing German artillery to be inferior to enemy artillery at the beginning of the war, resulting in national losses, etc. The deposed Emperor claimed that this was purely slander and filed a private lawsuit with the court. When the court opened today, the observers nearly filled the courtroom. The judge initially tried to reconcile the parties, but the plaintiff's lawyer insisted that he would not reconcile unless the statement was unconditionally withdrawn, and the defendant refused to do so and was willing to present evidence, so the lawsuit proceeded. Both sides presented numerous pieces of evidence. Finally, the judge ruled in favor of the plaintiff because the defendant failed to prove the allegation that the deposed Emperor spent national funds to enrich his private purse.</p>

<p>Minor Riots Erupt in the Capital</p>
<p>Military and Police Strictly Enforce Martial Law</p>
<p>▲ Reuter, Argentina Capital, 5th - President Irigoyen has handed over power to the Vice President. Vice President Martin has declared martial law in the capital for one month to restore order. The President's resignation is the result of workers' grievances. Initially, the authorities feared workers would riot and ordered the navy and army to take special precautions, but demonstrations against the government continued. Thereupon, the cabinet expressed its willingness to resign en masse if the President also resigned, but the President refused. Shortly afterwards, the Chief of the Army tendered his resignation. Thereupon, everyone advised the President to hand over power to the Vice President, saying that this was the only way to ensure that the development of events would not exceed the scope of the Constitution. Although minor riots are now erupting in the capital from time to time, the military is able to suppress them.</p>
<p>▲ Associated Press, Argentina Capital, 5th - After the resignation of Argentine President Irigoyen today, the people of the capital were greatly alarmed for a time. The authorities immediately declared martial law. Although defenses were heavily fortified everywhere, multiple clashes occurred between student groups and military police during the day. As soon as the news of the President's resignation spread, students lined up outside, set off firecrackers, and even threw bombs. However, judging from the sentiments of the masses, everyone believed that Irigoyen's resignation was a temporary measure of last resort and that he could still be reinstated according to law when the opportunity arose.</p>

<p>▲ Associated Press, Santo Domingo, 5th - The recent hurricane was the most severe in the history of the Caribbean region. The hurricane was followed by 24 hours of wind and rain. The hurricane's speed was approximately 180 miles per hour and lasted for two hours. It is estimated that approximately 1,500 people have died, 5,000 have been injured, and tens of thousands are homeless.</p>
<p>▲ Associated Press, Santo Domingo, 5th - The colonial government here is making every effort to plan measures to prevent riots and epidemics, so that they do not take the opportunity to erupt. All corpses are being cremated to protect public health. Ships and airplanes from various places are now transporting food and other daily necessities daily. It is said that a certain church where Columbus was buried was not damaged by the wind and remained completely intact.</p>
<p>▲ Reuter, Santo Domingo, 6th - According to the latest estimates, the death toll from this hurricane is approximately between 1,500 and 2,000 people. Many more are now dying due to poor sanitary conditions. According to reports from US naval officers who flew over Santo Domingo, the hurricane was followed by great floods, and even the coffins in the graves were washed away. The coffins floated on the surface of the water like cork stoppers. The authorities are now collecting the corpses and burning them. The vehicles transporting corpses are constantly on the road, and the drivers often complain of overwork. Men and women cannot cover their bodies with clothes due to the destruction of their homes.</p>

<p>Issue of Supreme Command</p>
<h3 id="e58">Japanese Cabinet Unwilling to Yield <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 6th - After the meeting of the Privy Council's Investigation Committee yesterday, regarding the issue of supreme command, the government's explanation, freely collected unauthoritative materials, and reached a conclusion. Its attitude is extremely incomprehensible in describing opinions opposed to the government in the review report. If there is only a difference of opinion, the government should enthusiastically explain it, but if words such as "violation of the supreme command" are used to create a warning, the government is determined to gamble the fate of the cabinet and adopt a decisive attitude.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 6th - Regarding the issue of supreme command under deliberation, how the Privy Council's Investigation Committee will report at this meeting will directly affect the cabinet's responsibility, so it is attracting much attention from all sides. It is reported that Chairman Ito's report contains statements such as "The government's explanation of the issue of supreme command conceals the facts, and the measures taken by Navy Minister Hamaguchi's administrative office at the time of the decision on the recall case are improper from a constitutional perspective." The government's intention is that only the treaty is consulted with the Privy Council, and that whatever opinions and resolutions the Privy Council may have on other matters, the government has no need to take responsibility.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 6th - At the eighth meeting of the Privy Council's Investigation Committee, it was decided to hold a meeting on the 8th, which will focus on the issue of military strength and also discuss financial issues such as using the surplus to reduce taxes and supplement planned expenses. Finance Minister Inoue will also attend that day to express his opinions on this issue.</p>

<p>▲ Reuter, Constantinople, 5th - The leader of Turkey's newly formed Liberal Republican Party, Fethi Bey, arrived in Smyrna today by ship from Constantinople across the Dardanelles Strait. A crowd lined up to greet him, surrounding the coast. Unexpectedly, a clash broke out with the police, and three policemen were pushed into the water, resulting in the arrest of three hundred people. It is said that the masses welcomed Fethi Bey, who opposes the government's economic policies, believing that the current severe economic panic in Turkey and the adverse impact on Smyrna's export trade are all caused by these policies.</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin, Ankara, 5th - Reports state that staff members of the French Consulate in Smyrna played a leading role in preparing for the welcome. However, whether there are foreign individuals involved behind the scenes of this anti-government demonstration has not yet been confirmed.</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: I recently met with a key figure in the military and inquired about the recent military situation of the various armies. According to him, the Jin army on the north bank of the Yellow River is Feng Pengzhu's unit on the front line of the railway, Wang Jingguo's unit in Huimin, and in Putai and Lijin further east are the bandit armies previously recruited in Jiaodong. The railway line is held by Fu Zuoyi's and Li Fuying's units, and the area around Dong'e and Pingyin is held by the bandit army of Xue Chuanfeng's unit, with no formal Jin army. The Jin army has not recently increased reinforcements, but when the Jin army retreated north of Jinan on the 15th of last month, four reinforcement regiments arrived on the north bank of the Yellow River. Seeing that the overall situation was hopeless, they did not dare to cross the river. Gao Guizi himself took a battalion of his unit across the river from Putai to Huimin. The remnants on the south bank of the Yellow River have become bandits. This morning, I received a telegram from Xu Wenyao, Deputy Commander of the 14th Army, stating that the remnant enemies in Xiaoying Street, north of Boxing City, have been surrounded by our army and can be resolved immediately. In Wen Shang City, there are still two regiments of enemy army, Zhang Huizhao's unit, only about a thousand men, currently surrounded by the 2nd Security Regiment, Chen Xiaosi's unit, and can be resolved within a few days. Our army's defenses on the south bank of the Yellow River are extremely solid. Recently, the two armies have been shelling each other across the river every evening, but there have been no formal battles. (September 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e62">Quiet War Situation in Guangxi Province <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>▲ Guangdong Army Sends Troops to Suppress Bandits on the Southern Border</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The war in Guangxi has been quiet for a long time. When Chen Jitang returned to Guangdong a few days ago, it was claimed externally that Yu Hanmou's division had occupied Binyang. According to a recent investigation, Yu's division only approached Binyang on that day. Because the enemy army was still stationed with heavy troops in Qianjiang, he had to proceed cautiously. In recent days, he has still been making arrangements, and the war situation at the front has been quite quiet. According to a recent report from Chen Hanguang, the head of the Guard Regiment stationed in Guixian, the actual situation is as follows: 1. Yu Hanmou, the commander of the column, has now decided to attack Binyang, cutting off the connection between the Yong and Liu rebel armies in order to divide the troops and suppress them. He has recently ordered the 59th Division and the Huang Brigade's Fan Regiment to advance fiercely towards Binyang. This regiment (i.e., the Guard Regiment) was ordered by Commander Yu to travel by boat from Da Huangjiang to Guixian, and then advance by land to launch a major offensive against the enemy. 2. It is reported that the rebel army has gathered seven or eight thousand men near Binyang to fight a decisive battle with us. The rebel army lacks food and ammunition, and its morale is disintegrating. If our army arrives, we can annihilate them. The Binyang battle should break out during the daytime. Our army has been very busy preparing for military affairs in recent days. 3. The rebel army has now tilted the remaining enemies from Liu and Yong in an attempt to make a final struggle with our army. They are bound to fail. If this battle is fought, the military situation in Guangxi can be resolved, etc. As for the enemy army, the majority are still concentrated in Liuzhou. Recently, due to supply difficulties, most of the soldiers are short of food, and the military equipment cannot be replenished. It is reported that the Guangxi army, Huang Shaoxiong, recently purchased a batch of bullets from a certain place and remitted 300,000 yuan in cash, which will be transported from Chikan in Guangzhou Bay to Luchuan on the Guangxi border to supply a certain Lu on the Guangdong-Guangxi border, allowing him to harass the Guangdong border. This matter was discovered by Li Jiezhi, the commander of the Second Independent Regiment stationed in the army. He telegraphed the Eighth Route Army Headquarters yesterday, and the Headquarters telegraphed Li to quickly send troops to distribute in Lianjiang, Huazhou, Maoming, and Xinyi to strictly guard against disasters. Therefore, the southern road of Guangdong Province has recently been prepared for bandit defense. In order to report on the defense of the area, Chen Zhangfu, the commander of the Southern Route Garrison, took the Beihai Wheel at the end of last month and arrived in the province on the 1st to report everything to Chen Jitang. Chen will return to defense about a week later. Recently, in order to prevent border bandits from causing trouble, the military authorities of the province added Zhong Fangjun's entire First Independent Regiment to Zhaoqing to assist the Third Battalion of the regiment, which was previously suppressing bandits in the Yunfu area. Moreover, Zhaoqing is adjacent to the southern road, and the terrain is important, so more capable troops must be sent to quickly quell the banditry in the area to reassure travelers. After receiving the order, the commander of the regiment led the First and Second Battalions on the 2nd, taking more than ten civilian ships to various places in Zhaoqing to defend against and suppress bandits.

Each location is designated as a Joint Military and Police Temporary Checkpoint at a certain location in Fuzhou City. 2. Each checkpoint is to have one Director, to be held by the military officer stationed at that location. 3.

Each checkpoint, regardless of troop strength, should have a platoon leader permanently stationed at the location, to be able to handle matters appropriately in case of emergency, to ensure caution. 5. In addition to being supervised by their respective direct military and police superiors, the military and police at each checkpoint are also under the command of Headquarters. Article 4, Checkpoint Rules: 1. Check suspicious pedestrians for the presence of concealed military weapons. 2. Check people's transported boxes, crates, and miscellaneous items for the presence of concealed military weapons. 3. Anyone found to be secretly carrying various military weapons should be immediately detained along with the contraband and sent to Headquarters for verification and handling, while also reporting to their direct superior. However, from the time of discovery, reports and transfers should be made separately within one hour, and they should not be detained in the station for long or handled privately, and especially not allow the principal to escape. If there is concern about escape during transfer, Headquarters may be requested to send troops to escort them. 4. Anyone found to be in possession of any prohibited items (such as white pills and opium) should also be detained along with the perpetrator and handed over to the relevant police station for transfer to the Public Security Bureau for legal processing. At the same time, the type and quantity of the contraband and the names and number of perpetrators should be reported separately to Headquarters and their direct superiors for record keeping. The resulting bonus should be fairly distributed by Headquarters in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau. 5. Checkpoints must not arbitrarily delay matters or deliberately create difficulties, and should release people as soon as they are checked. 6. All checkpoints must adopt an extremely peaceful attitude and must not be rude or impolite. If someone refuses to be checked, they must be kindly persuaded. If they genuinely resist being checked, they may be detained and handed over to Headquarters for verification. 7. Except for cases of secretly carrying military weapons and contraband where both people and goods are detained, no other people's property may be taken without permission. 8. Checkpoint hours: apply at any time, day or night, whenever there are pedestrians on the road. 9. Each checkpoint should rotate in shifts according to the number of military and police personnel, performing checkpoint duties, and must always be at a suitable location on the road, checking at any time. The rotation and distribution methods are to be determined by the Director. 10. Regarding the checking of suspicious women, each relevant police station should find ways to handle it nearby. 11. Military and police at checkpoints, regarding military discipline and conduct, in addition to being supervised and commanded by the Director, their direct superiors must also bear the responsibility of supervision and command.

<h3 id="e64">Communist Bandits Near Changsha Have Been Repelled <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Hankou dispatch: Previously, the communist bandits Peng Dehuai, Huang Gonglue, Kong Hechong, etc., in Changsha, Pingjiang, Liuyang, and other places in Hunan Province, were head-on attacked severely by He Jian's troops of the Fourth Route Army and the Gong and Luo Divisions, suffering great losses and fleeing to the border of Jiangxi. They regrouped with the remnants and were again defeated by the Jiangxi army, fleeing to the Tonggu and Xiushui areas on the Jiangxi border to join up with Zhu De and Mao Zedong's troops. Recently, they gathered again about 30,000 to 40,000 people and invaded Pingliu at the end of last month. At the beginning of this month, Peng Dehuai again led the 5th and 6th Armies through Pingliu to Huanghuashi near Changsha. Zhu and Mao led the 11th and 12th Armies, and Huang Gonglue and Lin Biao led the 4th and 6th Armies (a communist army usually has 5,000 to 6,000 men, but sometimes as few as 1,000 to 2,000 men) from the Zhuzhou area, through Pujishi and Zhentoushi to Guandaopu, attempting to re-invade Changsha, making a desperate gamble. He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, believing that the communist army was coming fiercely, decided to shorten the battle line, lure them deep, and then attack again. The Hankou Xingying [Field Headquarters], for the sake of overall suppression, also transferred the New 5th Division under Gong Bingfan, the New 22nd Division under Luo Lin, the 3rd Teaching Division under Qian Dajun, and the New 3rd Division under Li Yunlong, to advance towards Tongcheng, Pingjiang, Liuyang, Changsha, and other places from various directions. It also dispatched naval vessels such as the Xianning and Yongsheng to sail to the Changsha River surface, as well as stationed Hankou's Curtiss Hawk and other fighter planes, and Xiangjiang seaplanes and other aircraft, to fly to assist in the battle, conduct ground reconnaissance and bombing. It also ordered the Hunan Provincial Qingxiang [Purge Countryside] Command to guide farmers in various districts to organize Farmers' Communist Elimination Volunteer Teams to assist the army and jointly defend against the bandits, so as to prevent the bandits from fleeing to various townships and disturbing the people. After receiving the order from the Hankou Xingying, He Jian planned everything, and at the beginning of this month, he had completed the deployment of all troops and constructed defensive fortresses in the suburbs, arranging three layers of electrified wire, with extremely solid works. On the 1st and 2nd of this month, there were small contacts in the suburbs of Changsha from time to time, but the gains and losses were very small and unimportant. Since the 3rd, He Jian believed that the time was ripe and ordered Luo Lin's division on the left wing to attack from Laodaoh River towards Baimaopu, Tao Guang's division to attack from Houzishi on the right wing, and Chen Guangzhong's brigade to cross the river from Datopu to encircle and attack the bandits from the side and rear. One side ordered the Xianning and Yongsheng ships patrolling the river surface to continuously bombard the communist army on the right bank from the upper reaches of Houzishi. Curtiss Hawk and other fighter planes and Xiangjiang seaplanes flew over the enemy's positions from time to time, bombing important parts of the enemy and lowering to a thousand feet to strafe with machine guns. After two days of fierce fighting, the communist army under Kong Hechong on the right wing was attacked by Luo's division, and countless were killed or wounded, and hundreds of guns were captured. At 1:00 PM on the 3rd, Luo's division occupied Baimaopu Zhanggongling, and the bandits collapsed in a southeasterly direction. The communist bandits under Peng Dehuai on the left route were attacked by Tao's division and also collapsed in disorder. A part of them fled to Changle, which was intercepted and attacked by the Li Tuan stationed in Yuezhou, advancing to Miluo. According to aircraft reports, on the 4th, all armies launched an attack on all fronts, and the left, right, and center routes all achieved victories, killing countless bandits. By 5:00 PM, the bandit forces were unable to hold out, and the bandits in Huangwangling and Lannichong retreated southeast towards Dongjingpu, while the bandits in Letang and Dongshan retreated to the vicinity of Houjiachong and Baizhutang, in an extremely embarrassed state. Aircraft carried eight heavy bombs and dropped them along the retreat route of the communist army, killing a total of hundreds of bandits. The Xiangjiang seaplane dropped two 60-pound bombs in a communist bandit den at the Southern Route Cotton Industry Testing Ground on the 3rd. At that time, more than a thousand communist bandits had gathered in the field, and hundreds were also killed. Currently, all armies are pursuing and advancing, encircling and suppressing them in separate directions. It is rumored that Peng and Huang suffered heavy losses and planned to flee to Chaling and the Lianhua area on the border of Hunan, returning to their old nest in Jinggang to prolong their existence. The military authorities are currently pursuing and suppressing them. (September 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Jiangxi Provincial Government Reports on the Situation of Communist Bandits <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: Communist bandits in Jiangxi Province are the most rampant. The Provincial Government yesterday released a report on the recent situation of communist bandits and the general situation of suppression. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Situation of Communist Bandits (1) Zhu Mao in Western Jiangxi: After Zhu Mao's bandit troops failed to invade the Niuhang Railway Station from Gaoan and Fengxin last month, they fled from Shanggao and Yifeng to Wanzai, reorganized the sentinel teams into pseudo-peasant self-defense forces, and held a meeting in Daqiao on July 16th, deciding to jointly disrupt Hunan and Hubei with the pseudo 1st and 2nd Army Corps. After the meeting, they fled towards Daqiao Zhutan. On the 17th, there were no traces of bandits in Wanzai City. They then fled from Daqiao to Tanbu Huangmao Pingjiang, forming a line with the Peng bandits in Pingjiang, and invaded Changsha. (2) Fang Zhimin in Eastern Jiangxi: 1. Fang's bandits attacked and captured Yujiang on August 10th, massacring more than 500 people, with huge property losses. 2. Hu Zhaoxiang and other reactionaries in Yiyang colluded with the county police team to rebel, killing county party committee members Fang Du, Fang Keqiang, Fan Wenying, Xie Zechun, etc. Fang's bandits took advantage of the chaos and captured the city on August 5th, with hundreds of civilians killed. 3. The city walls of Leping had been dismantled long ago, making defense difficult. The provincial and county police teams stationed there guarded different areas. Fang's bandits attacked with all their forces on August 19th. The police team fought unfavorably, and the city fell the next day. 4. Poyang is an important town in northern Jiangxi. The county police team has 500 guns, and the county magistrate is the commander of the first district, so it was believed that it could be secured without worry. Unexpectedly, at dawn on August 27th, it was suddenly breached by Fang's bandits. According to a section member of the provincial government who escaped from the county, the county police team was stationed outside the city, leading to the bandits taking advantage of the situation. (3) Bandits in various counties are stirring up trouble: 1. The 2nd and 3rd Red bandit corps under Ke Wudong and Li Shaojiu, with 400 to 500 guns and 2,000 to 3,000 men, captured Xiajiang on August 21st. 2. Bandits in Tonggu Paibu and Pingtan colluded with more than 1,000 bandits who had dispersed from Zhu Mao in Yifeng, with 400 guns, killing everywhere. Approaching the county seat, most of the ripe rice in the countryside was harvested by them. 3. About 400 to 500 hooligans and local bullies in Ningdu held a meeting in Dongcaojiang near the county, organizing a pseudo-Soviet government. 4. The 20th Red Army under Li Yunxiu led more than 3,000 men, with about 800 guns, crossed the river at dawn attempting to attack Ji'an, but were defeated by the New 13th Division. 5. The 22nd Red Army, with about 1,000 men and hundreds of guns, approached the edge of Ganxian city, but were forced to flee towards Mojiashan by Ma's brigade of the 12th Division. 6. In Xiushui, there is a bandit leader Fang Guomin claiming to be the commander of the pseudo Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Border Defense Team, with about 400 guns, entrenched in Mashi, 60 li from the city. The county militia has gathered more than 10,000 people, blocking the key points in separate directions. 7. The bandit leader Huang Jiafa, claiming to be the commander-in-chief of the 14th Red Army, with about hundreds of men and dozens of guns, colluded with local bullies and hooligans in Gaoan Fenghuangjing, wantonly harassing. It is said that the bandits opposed Zhu Mao's unfair distribution of spoils and withdrew on their own, setting up their own banner. 8. The bandits in Yifeng Tianbao, a part of them have already fled with Zhu Mao, and another part is still haunting the area. The county is currently planning to encircle and suppress them. 9. In Nanfeng, there are more than a hundred bandits, with forty guns, gathering people in Poyangpu to establish a farmers' association. From the above, except for Zhu Mao and Fang Zhimin, the rest are mobs and cannot withstand a single blow. If the local self-defense capabilities are strengthened day by day, these jumping clowns will not be able to cause trouble.</p>
<p>▲ General Situation of Suppression (1) Commander-in-Chief Chiang ordered all 50 divisions to return to Jiangxi to suppress the bandits. Yue's brigade arrived in Jiujiang on August 31st and is currently stationed in the Nansun Road area. It is reported that Cheng and Luo's brigades are being transferred. (2) The Capital Special Service 3rd Regiment opened to Xun for joint defense. Jiujiang was originally defended by the Capital Special Service 2nd Regiment. To strengthen the force, the National Government sent the 3rd Regiment under Zhang Yuannan to open to Xun, which arrived on the 28th. The military appearance is very orderly, and the defense of Xun is more solid. (3) Curtiss Hawk fighter planes arrived in the province. The Central Government had previously sent the Moth aircraft to Jiangxi to assist in suppressing the communist bandits. Chairman Lu believed that the aircraft missions were numerous during the bandit suppression period, and specially requested the Central Government to send another Curtiss Hawk fighter plane to Jiangxi. The aircraft has flown from Beijing to the province and has been conducting reconnaissance of bandit activity and bombing bandit nests for days, with significant results. (4) Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces sent troops to Jiangxi to assist in suppressing the bandits. Guangdong Chairman Chen has agreed to Chairman Lu's request to transfer a regiment to be stationed in Ganxian. The provincial government telegraphed the county magistrate Wang of the county to represent the welcome. Also, Zhejiang Chairman Zhang has sent a regiment of provincial defense forces to rush from Changshan to Yushan to assist in suppressing the communist bandits in eastern Jiangxi. (5) Various armies defeated the communist bandits. Brigade Commander Dai of the 18th Division, because Zhu Mao and Peng Huang were combining and had plans to attack Changsha again, supervised his troops to pursue the bandits. Also, Anfu was captured the other day. Division Commander Deng sent the 3rd Regiment to recover the county seat and escort Acting County Magistrate Wang Shaojie back to the county to handle the aftermath. Regiment Commander Wu of the 2nd Regiment of the police preparedness regiment recovered Xiajiang on August 25th. The bandits have fled far away.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Traffic Inside and Outside Shanhaiguan Gradually Restored <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>▲ Jilin-Beiping Joint Tickets on Sale</p>
<p>▲ Communication Line Between Fengtian and Tianjin Temporarily Used</p>
<p>Jilin dispatch: At the beginning of the month, the floods in western Liaoning caused great damage to the Beining Railway, and traffic inside and outside Shanhaiguan was interrupted for a long time. Trains between Beiping and Liaoning were not running. All passenger and freight traffic to and from the Northeast had to detour through Yingkou and Lianhe. Also, because the poles along the line were broken, telegrams were also cut off. Except for first-class official telegrams and third-class urgent telegrams, which could be sent via the Dalian water line and arrive on the same day, the rest, such as fourth-class commercial telegrams and reduced-price news telegrams, could only be sent to Yingkou, then mailed to Tianjin, and then forwarded, often arriving as late as four or five days or a week later, which was very inconvenient for merchants. It is now reported that the Beining Railway has been repaired and reopened on the 29th, without any obstacles. For the time being, one passenger train between Shenyang and Huai and one direct train between Shenyang and Beiping, as well as one freight train, will be opened daily. All roads in Jilin, Changchun, Jihai and Jitun have been approved by the road authorities to start selling Beiping joint tickets on the 30th. However, direct traffic between Jilin and Beiping will have to wait until the Beining Railway is fully restored before the date of traffic is discussed. The rumor that the traffic plan was cancelled is not true. According to news from the local telegraph bureau, the Beining telegraph line is being restored with great effort. The communication line between Fengtian and Tianjin has been repaired and perfected, and it will be used temporarily to transmit telegrams. From the 30th, it can be used without hindrance and does not need to be mailed through Yingkou. The 29th was the anniversary of the annexation of Japan and Korea. The authorities were deeply concerned that Koreans would cause trouble, and ordered the military and police in various places to be on strict alert in advance. As expected, on this day, a large number of bandits were found at the Liushuhe Station on the Jitun Railway, burning the stationmaster's office and killing many road workers. Later, because the military and police arrived in time, they were dispersed. The train still ran as usual, and there was no other damage. (August 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Heilongjiang Province Comforts and Reassures Border Residents <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Harbin dispatch: Along the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River, from Mohe to Suibin, during the Russian military invasion last year, it was almost completely ravaged. The people were displaced and scattered, and the towns and villages became ruins. Although it seems that there are no Russian troops this year, Russian bandits are still active and constantly disrupting. For example, in Suibin, Luobei, Foshan, Wuyun, Qike, Aihun, Oupu, Huma, Mohe and other nine counties, merchants and residents have not fully returned to their hometowns. Huma, Mohe, Oupu, and Foshan counties have recently petitioned the provincial government to send troops to station there and to reorganize the border checkpoints to strengthen the frontier. At the same time, they also requested financial assistance to revive the business market. Therefore, the provincial government ordered Pang Guoguang, a specialist from the Secretariat, to go to the counties to investigate and comfort the people. At the same time, Wang Jingxiu, the chief of staff of the National Defense Preparatory Office, was ordered to go to the above-mentioned counties to inspect the border defense situation, investigate the Baojia and Karen situation, and then seek to improve the methods. Wang and Pang have already left yesterday, passing through Harbin. (August 31st)</p>

<p>Bandit Gang Returns and Another Kidnapping Case Occurs: Previously, the Tai Bao A Shu bandit gang entrenched itself in Liu Jia Yan Bridge and other places in this county, kidnapping, extorting, and committing all kinds of evil. The local people suffered greatly. Since they left for other places to rob on the 22nd of last month, the village has been slightly peaceful. Recently, it was heard that the bandit gang was defeated in the Zhang Lian Tang area of Jiashan County by the Jiahu Bandit Command, and it was thought that they could be somewhat suppressed. Unexpectedly, after the suppression by Re Gong, only more than ten people were killed and four were captured. Except for Pan Amu, who was killed on the spot, and Tai Bao A Shu, who was slightly injured, others such as Zhu Tan A Mei, Lu Heshang, and Yang Meimei were not injured. Therefore, although they suffered a small loss, their power has not diminished. Recently, these people have returned to their old nest in batches and are hiding in various places. When one batch of them returned, they happened to encounter the Pinghu-Shanghai Ban Xinqing Ferry near Xupu Tang, and stopped them for robbery, causing losses of more than 2,000 yuan. As a result, unrest has reappeared in the local area. It is heard that the family of farmer Gan Jinhai in Luhua Tan, about three li from Zhangyan, was suddenly visited by several bandits with box cannons on their waists on the evening of the 2nd of this month. After entering the room, they looted wantonly. When they left, they also took Gan Jinhai's nephew away, and placed a letter on the table, which stated (a ransom of 2,500 yuan, to be prepared within three days). Gan Hai was greatly shocked upon reading it, and it is not known whether he has prepared the ransom or not.</p>

<p>People of Xu Gongqiao Petition for the Release of Wang Lin: Yesterday, Wang Lin, the principal of the Xu Gongqiao Central Primary School, was arrested by members of the Nanjing Garrison Command and handed over to the county government to be escorted to Beijing due to a case. Local people believed that Wang Lin had been in the school for more than a year, and his words and deeds were very cautious on weekdays. He was very enthusiastic about educating children. More than fifty local township chiefs and student families telegraphed the Central Party Department and Garrison Headquarters of the National Government in Nanjing, requesting his release after questioning. The text of the telegram is recorded as follows: To the Central Party Department and Garrison Headquarters of the National Government in Nanjing, Wang Lin, the principal of Xu Gongqiao Central Primary School, has been in office for more than a year, and has been focused on education. His words and deeds are peaceful, and he has gained the trust of the local people. He is content in his remote hometown and has no political odor. We were deeply shocked by his arrest yesterday. We, the residents, have lived here for generations and are living in peace. We are making this request out of conscience. If there are no special circumstances, we beg you to release him quickly. Township chiefs Jiang Daguang and Lu Huilan of Xu Gongqiao, Kunshan County, and student families Cai Huang, Zhang Cheng, etc., fifty-four people together kowtow in the sun.</p>
<p>A Swarm of Bees Almost Caused Trouble: Kunshan Xiaoxiong Bee Farm recently set up a branch farm in Zhangjing Township in the 8th District of this county, raising more than 130 boxes of bees. Every day at about 5:00 AM, they are released into the fields. The farmers in the township are not well-informed and consider the bees trampling the crops, and that the harvest will inevitably be damaged. They gathered to drive them away. Township Chief Wang Chengdong, fearing that it would cause trouble, tried his best to stop them, and at the same time reported to the district office for investigation. After receiving the report, District Chief Zhang sent a letter to the farm owner, inviting him to come to the office to discuss a proper solution. As a result, the farm owner guaranteed that if the place where the bees were released had a poorer harvest compared to other fields, he would be responsible, and he also publicized the benefits of beekeeping to the farmers. It was thus possible to avert the trouble invisibly.</p>
<p>Continued Investigation of the An Ting Murder Case: In the case of Fu Pinhua, a passenger at An Ting Railway Station, being injured, falling into the river, and dying, the county government detained the station porter Lu Jinzhang for interrogation. The entire staff of An Ting Railway Station, as well as the section chief of the East Section Car Affairs Section, telegraphed the Car Affairs Department separately, and the latter forwarded it to the Jinghu Railway Administration, which in turn sent a letter to the county government, inquiring about the reason for the detention of the porter. County Magistrate Chen has sent back the statements of the person who reported the case, the witness, and the corroborating evidence obtained from the investigation, stating that Fu Wangshi is indeed the wife of the deceased Fu Pinhua, and that Zhou Peirong and Qiao A'er are not go-betweens. Lu Jinzhang is highly suspected of causing the death of Fu Pinhua. A certain employee of the station and others are also related to the case and need to be interrogated according to the law. Stationmaster Zhou Xichen did not stop Lu's crime at the time, and later falsely accused the deceased's wife Fu Wangshi and Zhou Peirong and others of abduction. There is also a strong suspicion that he intentionally fabricated facts to cover up the perpetrator. The case should be handled according to the law. The Administration was notified. Also, Police Chief Zhu was ordered to take a document to Shanghai a few days ago to liaise with the Administration regarding this case and has returned to the county to report. The Administration also sent someone to An yesterday to investigate the facts. It is believed that there will be a solution to this case soon.</p>

<p>Change of Director of the Finance Bureau: Chen Liangdong, Director of the Finance Bureau, has repeatedly requested to resign to the Finance Department due to the extremely high local financial deficit and the actual difficulties in handling affairs. Chen, the director of the department, has approved his resignation. The vacancy will be filled by Zhuang Yeguang, who is recorded as a candidate for Director of the Finance Bureau. The matter has been submitted to the provincial government meeting for approval, and Director Chen has been ordered to expedite the handover.</p>
<p>Deterioration of Autumn Cocoon Information: Since the emergence of autumn cocoons in Wuxi last year, and with the best efforts of the silk cocoon industry in promoting them, farmers have generally recognized the benefits and raised a great deal of silkworms. However, the spring and summer cocoons of this year have been greatly affected by bad weather, and silk factories have deeply felt the pain of raw material shortage. Therefore, the promotion efforts have been particularly strong. The number of autumn silkworm eggs sold by various breeding farms is quite large. Unexpectedly, due to inconsistent weather, temperature, and the mixture of wind and rain, the silkworms have deteriorated, and the cocoons are of very low quality. Therefore, various manufacturers are wary. They specially convened a meeting of all industry members yesterday to discuss the matter. All agreed that the opening of the autumn cocoon market is imminent, but the cocoons this year are of low quality and the silk yield is particularly low. In order to maintain costs, various factories should be cautious in receiving goods to prevent losses. The resolution was passed by all members. As a result, various manufacturers have adopted a calm attitude towards the opening of the cocoon market. As of yesterday, the number of firms reporting their opening was less than one hundred.</p>
<p>Mass Education Committee and Cotton Mills Hold Important Meeting: The County Mass Education Committee convened yesterday a meeting of the executive and supervisory committee members of cotton mills such as Xin, Yu, Kangye, Qin, and Guangqin. The following resolutions were made: (1) Regarding the issue of preventing reactionaries, the executive and supervisory committee members of the Mass Education Committee shall be responsible for effectively monitoring and immediately report any suspicious events or people to the county party headquarters. (2) Regarding the reorganization of the labor union, we will wait for the county party headquarters to send personnel to guide the reorganization according to the new law. (3) Regarding the issue of wages on revolutionary memorial days, the county party headquarters will urge the county government to strictly order the employers of various factories to promptly issue wages in accordance with the provincial order. (4) The county government will supervise the factories to implement the Factory Law.</p>
<p>Mediation of Dispute over the Construction of an Oil Tank: The Yuantai Petroleum Company previously built an oil tank outside the East Gate, which was opposed by nearby factories and residents who feared the danger of storing kerosene. The lawsuit has been going on for years without a resolution. After the opening of the Jiatai Silk Factory this year, the factory repeatedly petitioned the county government and the Construction Department to ban the oil tank because it was located next to the silk factory. Yesterday, the Construction Department instructed the county government to notify the County Chamber of Commerce and the parties concerned to hold a meeting in the county to mediate the dispute on the 12th of this month.</p>
<p>Another Robbery Case Reported in Kaihua Township: Recently, robbery cases have been occurring frequently in the four townships of this county. Although the authorities have been strictly pursuing and arresting the bandits, very few cases have been solved, which has emboldened the bandits and made them extremely rampant. Yesterday, in Nianqi Situ Dianli Lane, Kaihua Township, the home of Hui Jizhu was robbed by six or seven bandits who climbed over the wall and entered the house. They robbed 500 yuan in silver dollars and all valuables, with total losses reaching 1,000 yuan. A certain long-term worker of the Hui family was tied up with a rope, hung up, and severely beaten, resulting in injuries all over his body and inability to move.</p>

<p>Execution of a Bandit Who Aided the Rebels: The Jiangsu Provincial Security Department, based on the report from Liu Hanzhen, commander of the 133rd Brigade, that Wang Hetian, a bandit who aided the rebels and gathered people to rob the armory, was delivered, questioned Wang, who confessed without reservation. The provincial government was immediately notified and approved the death penalty. Therefore, yesterday at about 12:00 noon, the bandit was brought out to verify his identity and escorted to the execution ground outside the North Gate for execution by firing squad. It is reported that Wang was from Lianshui and is 44 years old.</p>
<p>Yangzhong County Magistrate Accused of Soliciting Money: The Yangzhong County Shengsheng Silkworm Breeding Farm previously had its qualified silkworm eggs illegally detained by the county government. It urgently petitioned the Department of Agriculture and Mining to promptly order their release. However, the county magistrate did not comply with the department's order and attempted to use this as an opportunity to extort a large sum of money from the farm. Shareholders Dai Jingnian and Zhang Shuren believe that such corrupt behavior should not be tolerated under the clear blue sky and white sun. Yesterday, they submitted a petition to both the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Agriculture, requesting a thorough investigation to deter corruption and rectify officialdom.</p>
<p>Preparation for the Construction of Zhen Tan Road: The Zhenjiang County Executive Committee previously submitted a report to the Provincial Reorganization Committee, which forwarded it to the provincial government, ordering the Construction Department to expedite the construction of the Zhenjiang Jintan Highway.

<p>Bandits Run Rampant in the Eighth District: The Eighth District is located in a remote western region and has always been a haven for bandits. Although there is a security corps, it is of little help. At midnight on the 2nd, more than 30 bandits, dressed in plain clothes and carrying rifles, submachine guns, and Mauser pistols, arrived at the home of Zhu Dehua in Xiaohua Township. They kidnapped Wen Hua and his son. The family of Zhu Er Mazi, who had moved away, sent their eldest daughter-in-law and second daughter-in-law home to cut rice because it was the busy farming season. They were also kidnapped. At the same time, bandits broke down the door of Guo Zhixiang's house. Zhixiang escaped through the back door and reported to the Si Dunzi security corps. When the corps organized and went to the scene, the bandits had already kidnapped his son. In addition, six bandits arrived at the homes of the Ji Dasheng brothers and Wang's family near Sancai Store a few days ago, ransacked their homes and looted everything. Wang's son was stabbed several times. After the investigation, the losses of the three families were estimated to be more than 1,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Fierce Battle with Bandits in Ji Zhuang: The first platoon stationed in Shaojia Zhuang set out on patrol at 11:00 AM on the 31st. They encountered bandits while passing through Xiyelin. The two sides exchanged fire fiercely for about an hour, and the bandits were finally defeated and retreated. At 5:00 PM, Ji Zhuang reported that more than 100 bandits had burned the residence of Zhang Dusheng, including four main rooms, three kitchens, four gates, and timber and sundries, causing considerable losses. At the same time, the home of Tang Wenkui in Xiyelin was also burned. The troops immediately rushed to the scene and tried their best to extinguish the fire. The bandits opened fire upon seeing the soldiers, and the two sides exchanged fire for a long time before the bandits retreated. It is estimated that more than ten bandits were killed, including Gu Deshan, who was a company commander among the bandits, and Gu Tuzhang, who was the grain and grass commissioner for the bandits.</p>

<p>Execution of Four Kidnapping Bandits: Shi Yaogen, son of Shi Lansheng of Youguang Bridge outside the East Gate of Jiaxing, was kidnapped by bandits on April 25th of this year. He was later redeemed for 5,000 yuan. Zhang Yousong of Dayun Temple in Jiashan was also kidnapped by bandits on March 31st of this year. Because the asking price was too high, he was not redeemed. The Provincial Public Security Bureau later arrested the bandits Chen Peisheng, Shou Xing, Yang Ziming, Wang A Si, Ma Xin Chang, Pu Ruan Shi, etc. in the Puyuan Township area of Puyang's family. Zhang Yousong was found in the cellar and sent to the Provincial Government Security Department for interrogation. The Chen bandits confessed that they had conspired to kidnap Zhang Yousong and hid him in the cellar of Pu Ruanshi's house. The cellar was dug by Shou Xing and other bandits. They had previously kidnapped Yao Gen, son of Shi Lansheng of Youguang Bridge, and hid him in the same cellar, eventually extorting 5,000 yuan. Ma Xin Chang confessed that he only watched the treasury for one day, and his circumstances were relatively minor. He and Pu Ruan Shi were sentenced to imprisonment separately. The other four, Chen Peisheng, Shou Xing, Shou Ziming, and Wang A Si, were sentenced to death as usual. On September 5th, the provincial government escorted the bandits to Wei and then to Youguang Bridge for execution by firing squad.</p>
<p>County Public Security Bureau Chief Transferred: Mo Runxun, Chief of the Jiaxing County Public Security Bureau, was ordered to be transferred to Chief of the Shaoxing County Public Security Bureau, and Shen Weihan, Director of the Second District of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, was transferred to take over as Chief of the Jiaxing County Public Security Bureau. It is now learned that Shen has arrived in He after being appointed on the 6th and will take over the same day.</p>

<p>Bandits Demand Extortion and Prevent Tenants from Harvesting Rice: Tao Yongji, a resident of Dongzhang Wang Temple across the river from Hongxing Bridge in Changxing, has a wealth of assets and has long been coveted by bandits. Because of the rampant banditry, Tao moved to Changyi two years ago, renting out all his fields and only collecting interest. On the 26th of last month, seven or eight bandits suddenly arrived at the homes of Tao's tenants, ordering them to inform Tao that he had to borrow 40,000 yuan and pay it quickly. Tao ignored the message after hearing about it. Unexpectedly, at 7:00 PM on the 2nd of this month, the bandits who had demanded the extortion told the tenants that if Tao did not pay 40,000 yuan, they would not be allowed to harvest their rice, or else. However, the tenants' livelihoods depend on the autumn harvest, so the tenants are all worried.</p>
<p>Bandits Rob Accounting Boat in Dongqiao Village: In Dongqiao Village near Yangjia Zhuang outside the West Gate of this city, at about 3:00 PM on the 4th, six bandits speaking a foreign accent were seen looking around along the river. An accounting boat from Yuanfeng Distillery in this city happened to be passing by after collecting more than 300 yuan from Meixi and Heping. The bandits saw the boat coming and immediately took out their pistols, shouting for the boat to stop. The bandits jumped onto the boat and robbed all the money.</p>

<p>Meeting Held to Draft Soldiers: The Xiaoshan County Government received an order from the province to draft soldiers. On August 27th, a meeting was convened of village chiefs and deputy chiefs to discuss the matter. It was resolved that one soldier would be drafted for every 100 households and sent to the county before September 15th. It is now learned that the village chiefs and deputy chiefs find it difficult to draft soldiers, so no one has reported to the county yet. Now that the deadline is approaching, Xu Yuanzhang, the head of the First District Public Office, together with Gao Shichun, Chief of the Public Security Bureau, notified the village chiefs to convene another temporary meeting at 2:00 PM on September 6th to resolve the issue of drafting soldiers.</p>

<p>Private Arms Smuggling Case to Be Investigated: Li Buzhou and Huang Shuifu were caught smuggling 21 firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition at Sancha River and sent to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters for detention. The Sanhe Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed Commander Song and the county government, proving that Li is the captain of the trade union team and that the arms were purchased from Zhongxingji for self-defense. They requested that they be returned. However, the headquarters believes that during this period of martial law, transporting arms cannot be valid with the trade union's passport, and the photo has the words "Army Major General" on it. The current government leads this appointment. Furthermore, Zhang Ziquan, the head of the trade union, used to be under Zhang Zongchang, and there are concerns that it is for other purposes. On the 30th, they telegraphed back, stating that a detailed investigation is still needed.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Letter from Ma Tianmin <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>In yesterday's local news column of your newspaper, there was a Suzhou news item stating that "Ma Canmin committed suicide in an inn." After verification, many of the facts are inconsistent. I used to be the chief translator of the Great Li Lawyer's Office. After the recovery of the Mixed Court in the Concession, I retired and lived in seclusion, studying law. I have been sick for many years, taking medicine, staying at home, and making a living frugally. I have never served in the army, nor have I dared to hope to be rich. My younger brother, Wen Chao (also known as Canmin), has not been engaged in proper business in recent years and has been addicted to gambling. He has been repeatedly warned but has not repented. This time, he gambled again and used my name to solicit money everywhere (after the fact, it was discovered that there were many cases of fraudulently collecting money). He attempted to make a profit but was ashamed to see people, so he ran away. Before leaving, he took away antique calligraphy and paintings worth 180 yuan and pawned them for 6 gold. He went to Suzhou to take poison and was rescued, almost faking his death to make a joke of it. Otherwise, would he not have a place to die in Shanghai? My younger brother is young and ignorant, and his will is weak, as all relatives and friends know. I am concerned about my brother and cannot ignore him. My strict supervision has caused resentment. The claim that he committed suicide due to family pressure is not true. This matter concerns my reputation, and I cannot remain silent. Moreover, I am afraid that the outside world does not know the truth and will easily misunderstand. Therefore, I have briefly stated the situation and ask for a correction. I would be grateful. Ma Tianmin, September 6th.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Report on the Participation of the National Private Electricity Industry Association in the World Power Conference (Continued) <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Li Yanshi, Shen Sifang</p>
<p>(1) Liaison with Electricity Industry Associations of Various Countries, Inquiry about Their Organizational Status, and Exchange of Views on Association Affairs: The United Kingdom, France, Germany, Switzerland, and other countries all have sound organizations. The United Kingdom has a total of four electricity industry associations, one organized by sixteen large companies, one organized by ten commercial companies near London, one organized by small and medium-sized power plants across the country, and one organized by municipal power plants in various cities. The affairs of the French Electricity Industry Association are also very developed. The International Electricity Industry Association is located there. The German Electricity Industry Association has the most complete and developed organization. In addition to commercial companies, municipal power plants are also involved, and the combination of government and business is rare. Switzerland also has a spirit. (2) The Process of Joining the International Electricity Industry Association: When Yanshi and others were investigating in Switzerland, they learned that the International Electricity Industry Association was located in Paris. Through the introduction of the Swiss Electricity Industry Association, they met with the association's secretary, Berlin Sky, and learned that the association had been established for three years and had more than forty members. In mid-September of this year, the annual meeting was held in Beijing. Knowing that Yanshi and others represented the Chinese private electricity industry, they expressed their welcome and invited them to join the association and attend the meeting in Beijing. Because the annual meeting of our association was approaching, Yanshi and others had to return to China and requested Fei Futao to attend the meeting nearby. From then on, the Chinese electricity industry and the industry of various countries in the world will be united and will surely flourish in the future. (3) The Process of Contacting Various Manufacturing Factories: Due to overproduction and sluggish sales in various European countries, especially Germany, Yanshi and others visited various factories in Germany, such as the United Steel Company, Ai Yiji Siemens Electric Manufacturing Factory, Daoci Linkhoff Mentel Diesel Engine Manufacturing Factory, and the Swiss Bulangbi Electric Manufacturing Factory and Huajia Electric Meter Manufacturing Factory, all warmly welcomed and expressed their willingness to cooperate with this association, providing convenience to all colleagues. The consumer cooperation business of this association can be established. (4) Collection of Electrical Regulations and Statistical Reports of Various Countries: This time, wherever Yanshi and others went, the statistical annual reports and regulations regarding the electrical industry were collected very richly. The current situation of the electricity industry in various countries and the legal status of electrical enterprises became clearer. Most of the electricity industries in France are jointly operated by the city and business, and fewer are commercially operated. However, the state has constitutional provisions to protect commercial operations in a comprehensive manner. The following is an excerpt from Article 153 of the Constitution: Private property is guaranteed by the Constitution. When private property is requisitioned for public interest, a fair price must be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the law. In case of disputes, the decision must be made by the High Court. When the central government levies property from the local government, it must also pay a fair price. The British electrical regulations are even more comprehensive. Previously, the operating period of the British electricity industry was only twenty years. Later, due to various inconveniences, it was changed to forty years. Today, sixteen large electrical companies across the country have obtained permanent operating rights. Except for the Soviet government of Russia, the electricity industry is either commercially operated or municipally operated, or jointly operated by the city and business. There are no central government agencies directly operating. Although there is one factory in Germany directly under the central government, it is located near a coal mine, which is inconvenient for transportation and is used to generate electricity and sell it to various electrical companies, and is not directly operated. (5) Comparison of Electricity Prices in Various Countries: This time, from Nanyang India to Europe, we visited more than ten countries, visited factories, contacted association affairs, and visited friends. At the same time, we conducted on-site inspections of electricity prices and equipment conditions. Currently, various business regulations and statistical charts are on the way, and only the memories can be briefly described to know the outline. The business regulations of the Little Luzon Power Company are very complete. The method of pricing is divided into area fees. The minimum area of each room is 50 square meters, and the monthly fee is one peso. Above 50 square meters, an additional 20 points are charged for every 20 square meters. The electricity fee is 15 points per degree within 15 degrees, and gradually decreases above that. For example, if a small user uses 10 degrees of electricity per month, the price is 25 points per degree, which is equivalent to 5 cents in Chinese currency. In the Medan area of Dutch India, the price of electricity is 45 points per degree. The currency system in that area is roughly the same as Chinese currency. In Berlin, Germany, the price of electricity is 50 points per degree regardless of the base degree, and 20 points per degree for those with a base degree. Small users, including the base degree, cost between 1.8 and 1.9 cents in Chinese currency per degree. Also, according to a friend in the suburbs, the monthly electricity consumption is 75 degrees, and the price is 15 points per degree plus the base degree, which is 24 points per degree. In Hamburg, the price is 45 points per degree. In Switzerland, the price of electricity is divided into three levels: the highest is 50 points, the middle is 20 points, and the lowest is 7 points. The table rent is 7.5 Swiss francs per quarter. For the St. Paul Malle Company in London, the price of electricity is 4 pence per degree for annual consumption within 2,000 degrees, and the table rent is a minimum of 1 kilowatt, which is 2 shillings and 6 pence per quarter. For small and medium-sized users, the price is 5 pence per degree. The price of electricity for small and medium-sized power plants in China is more than one shilling per degree, and the power is more than 8 pence per degree. These power plants are larger than most of our large power plants in China. In the Li Ai Ji area of Belgium, the price of electricity is 2.2 francs per degree, plus table rent, etc., which is about 2.7 cents in Chinese currency per degree. In Moscow, Russia, the price of electricity is 18 kopecks per degree, which is equivalent to 3.6 cents in Chinese currency. From this point of view, the large cities of various countries have a large population, prosperous commerce, and a large power generation capacity of power plants, which are dozens or hundreds of times that of the average power plants in our country. The price is more expensive and is not available in our country. The price of electricity in our country is either the cheapest in the world or one of the cheapest. (6) Conversations with Various Experts: (A) University Professor and Electrical Expert Demai, who is the electrical commissioner of the recent German industrial inspection team to China, said that the joint operation of the electrical industry by the city and business is most suitable for the modern trend. However, China's politics is not yet on track, and officialdom is not yet clear, so it is not yet possible to talk about it, so commercial operation is still preferable. He also said that there are three prerequisites for Germany and China to cooperate in developing industry: first, to be realistic; second, to abide by the law; and third, to provide adequate guarantees. For the development of China's electrical industry, it is advocated to start with building more small-scale power plants. If large-scale power plants are built first, there is no need for them at present, and when the need is reached in the future, the machine styles and economic conditions will no longer be suitable. (B) Long Fu, Secretary of the German Electricity Industry Association and Doctor of Law, said that the association's members account for 95% of the total power generation capacity of all power plants in the country, regardless of whether they are municipal or commercial. The association is the only organization that connects the government and the people. Government policies are often implemented due to the mediation of the association. He also said that the German electrical industry is not worried about illegal administrative punishment due to the provisions of the Constitution. When commercially operated companies are transferred to municipal operation, the value of their wealth-generating and operating areas is estimated, and they are handled fairly and cash is issued, which often exceeds the face value. The takeover of the Berlin power plant by the city is one example. (C) Banker and Economic Doctor Nabro said that Germany's current difficulties are no less than those of China, and it relies entirely on foreign capital to survive. However, it is down-to-earth and trustworthy, so it can continue to turn around. Without credit, it would have been unimaginable long ago. China is currently affected by the high price of gold and the low price of silver and should vigorously promote production and export in order to balance the import and export of cash. Otherwise, there is no solution. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Nanjing, 6th: The Beijing Municipal Party Headquarters believes that the current national universities do not have the titles of vice-president, dean of academic affairs, secretary-general, etc., which are inconsistent with the current university organization law. Moreover, the presidents of various schools therefore hold only empty titles, travel abroad, causing internal disputes and wasting students' studies.

<h3 id="e88">Striving for Foreign Language Education <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>▲Regulations Promulgated to All Military Organs, Schools, and the Training Directorate General. The Directorate General held a working meeting at 9:00 AM the other day to discuss various urgent matters. The meeting was chaired by Deputy Director Zhou Yawei. The discussion items included: 1. Proposal to establish a military academic research association; 2. Proposal to organize a foreign language research association; 3. Other proposals (still in progress). The meeting also passed a proposal to promote foreign language education in all military organs, schools, and units, which is excerpted below. Proposal to promote foreign language education in all military organs, schools, and units: Given the global advancements in transportation and science, foreign languages serve as a tool for gathering a wide range of knowledge and a medium for absorbing new information. While studying abroad requires proficiency in the language to achieve effective results, even within the country, the ability to read foreign books and newspapers is essential for expanding knowledge and understanding military affairs. Since the end of the European war, military academics have undergone rapid changes. However, due to the scarcity of military personnel proficient in foreign languages in our country, the translated works of new books are rare, and widespread access to military affairs in various countries is difficult to achieve. Even selecting personnel for overseas study in the hope of learning from others is ineffective without qualified personnel proficient in the language of the study destination. Therefore, promoting foreign language education is a matter of utmost urgency. A summary of measures is proposed below for public decision. (Measures for promoting foreign language education in all military organs, schools, and units): 1. All military organs, schools, and units must ensure that military officers who have already learned a foreign language practice regularly to avoid becoming rusty and find ways to improve their proficiency. Those who have not learned a foreign language must be encouraged to learn. 2. All military organs and units, to promote foreign language education, should encourage officers to conduct self-study or set up remedial classes, assigning officers already proficient in a particular foreign language to provide guidance, without adhering to rigid formalities, but aiming to achieve this goal through various methods. 3. All army schools should add foreign language courses for cadets and students, and all instructors should either attend remedial classes with the students or establish separate research associations to implement this. 4. Foreign languages are temporarily limited to English, Russian, French, German, and Japanese. Each organ, unit, and school should adopt one or more languages, depending on its needs and practical circumstances. 5. Foreign language education and research, in addition to ordinary methods, should pay special attention to listening, note-taking, and military terminology. 6. Each unit and school under the headquarters should, at the end of each year, report to the headquarters on the foreign language research situation of all officers, cadets, and students for assessment. Those who are capable of translation and direct listening should be carefully reported according to the following investigation form for reference. Military organs can also follow these guidelines for their subordinates. 7. Foreign Language Education Investigation Form (Form omitted).</p>

<h3 id="e93">Reorganization and Establishment of the Guangdong Academy of Law <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Guangdong Academy of Law, formerly known as the Guangdong Judges Academy, was founded by the Premier during his tenure as Grand Marshal in 1924. Initially, it was directly under the jurisdiction of the Guangdong Higher Court and the Procuratorate. In 1926, when the former Judicial Yuan was in Guangdong, the president was once dismissed, and a committee system was adopted, with all members appointed by the ministry. After the Ministry of Justice moved to Wuhan, the old system was restored. A total of 297 students have graduated, and 762 students have studied at the academy, with excellent results. This time, the Ministry of Judicial Administration ordered the academy to be reorganized into an Academy of Law in accordance with the University Organization Law. Since it was reorganized into a national academy, it does not conflict with the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee regarding the central and local judicial administrative organs or courts not establishing educational institutions similar to judge training schools. Although the Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that the issue of affiliation should, in principle, be under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, the school was founded by the Premier and has been affiliated with judicial organs for a long time, with special historical circumstances. Therefore, it has consulted the Ministry of Education and intends to have the academy directly under the Ministry of Judicial Administration, with all matters such as the appointment of the president handled by the Ministry of Judicial Administration. (After the reorganization, it was established on July 21 this year, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration ordered the Guangdong Higher Court to appoint Yao Lixiu as the president. Yao graduated from Tokyo Hosei University in Japan and was sworn in on July 21.) It still requests the Ministry of Education for record. The Ministry of Education recently replied to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, stating that it has received the report from the National Guangdong Academy of Law regarding the reorganization and establishment of the academy and the date of the president's inauguration, requesting for record, and attached a resume, which has been passed to the ministry. It should be filed for record immediately. However, in accordance with the Measures for Unified Education Administration resolved at the Eighth Meeting of the Executive Yuan in 1929 (all schools and cultural undertakings, except for party affairs schools, military schools, and research institutes of the Academia Sinica, regardless of which organ establishes or conducts them, should report the educational part in detail to the Ministry of Education and be subject to the supervision and guidance of the Ministry of Education), a corresponding reply is given, hoping that your ministry will comply and report everything from time to time for reference.</p>
<p>German Industrial Circles</p>
<h3 id="e94">Donate Machinery and Gas Plant to Wuhan University <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The German Industrial Survey Group, which came to our country for inspection, visited Wuhan University and other colleges in Wuhan and toured the new campus construction site on the shore of East Lake. At that time, the chief representative of the survey group, Hesimen (Retimaun), praised the new campus plan of Wuhan University and expressed their intention to provide practical support. The representative group has reported the above situation to the German industrial circles.

<h3 id="e96">Shanghai Education Bureau Reforms Public Education Centers <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau will reorganize the internal organization of the public education centers established by the bureau from the 19th year onwards in order to maximize the effectiveness of dynamic education. The plan, drafted by the head of the section, Chen Duanzhi, has been submitted for discussion and approved by Director Chen, who has instructed all education centers to follow it. The reorganization plan is excerpted below. This bureau, after four months of trial in November of the 17th year, observed the practical needs and created public tea gardens. During the period of political tutelage, school education and social education are equally important, and the place for educating the public has to resort to the tea gardens of the recreation center. This is how the public tea gardens came into being. After a year of operation, it was generally believed that the reorganization of public tea gardens into tea gardens for the public was restrictive for the progress of the cause. Therefore, in November of the 18th year, a separate building was found to set up a simple public education center in order to implement the plan for public education. In the past six months, according to the research of this bureau and the reports of various directors, although it is slightly better than the public tea gardens, it is still far from the plan of this bureau. Now that the beginning of the year is approaching, the internal organization will be reorganized to maximize the effectiveness of dynamic education. The reorganization plan is listed below. (1) The internal organization of the public education center: 1. Newspaper and Book Department: Display popular libraries and purchase daily newspapers for public reading and learning. 2. Entertainment Department: Select and purchase entertainment equipment to cultivate the public's interest and habits in legitimate recreation. 3. Communication Department: Use correspondence and face-to-face inquiry methods to resolve the public's daily doubts. 4. Propaganda Department: Hold various popular lectures to guide the public's knowledge and skills in daily life. (2) Regulations on the duties of directors: 1. Lectures: Hold regular and circuit lectures on daily and occasional matters. 2. Guidance: Provide separate guidance on all matters in daily life. 3. Visits: Go deep into the people to connect emotions and understand the people's concerns. 4. Investigation: Conduct simple investigations to create simple statistics so that the public has the concept of comparing weights. (3) Revision of forms (omitted).</p>

<p>The football season of 1929 to 1930 can be said to be very successful. The difficulty felt was the interference of the rain, which often hindered the competition and extended the original schedule, which was not completed until the fourth week of April. In addition, the club's executives often found it difficult to allocate referees. Captain Graham of the British Army, who had refereeing experience, assisted the club a great deal with his experience, and the referees' dedicated service was very effective.</p>
<p>▲Interport Matches This year's Interport Matches were held in Shanghai. Tianjin and Hong Kong arrived in Shanghai as scheduled. Shanghai was very lucky and defeated Hong Kong and Tianjin to win the championship. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Date Winner Score Loser Score</p>

In the final, China and Scotland competed for the championship. China won 2-0 and won the cup championship.</p>
<p>▲Other Competitions The results of other competitions such as the Zilong Cup and the Junior Cup are that the former championship was won by St. Francis Xavier, and the latter belonged to the Navy. As for the Sino-Western Charity Match, whether to abandon it due to two unfinished matches or to hold another match will be resolved by the new staff.</p>
<p>Finally, the club expressed its deep gratitude to the enthusiastic people who participated in the club, such as Mr. Hao Boyang, Secretary General of the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation, and Captain Stephen of the British Army.</p>

<p>National Jinan University, having learned from the failure of the Far Eastern Games, is determined to promote physical education. It previously telegraphed Wu Tiecheng to consult with Mr. Bu, a German at Northeastern University, to be responsible for introducing a German coach to the school. After several back-and-forth telegrams, since Wu went elsewhere, President Zheng telegraphed Li Feng in Shenyang, asking him to contact President Liu of Northeastern University directly to introduce a coach. At that time, Mr. Liu had gone to Beidaihe. Yesterday, a reply telegram was received from Mr. Li, saying that Wu and Liu had now returned to Shenyang and that a German coach was being sought. President Zheng sent another telegram urging them to do so. The start of the semester is approaching, and he urged them to quickly appoint a coach. It is expected that he will come to the school soon after the start of the semester. Although the school does not hesitate to spend heavily to recruit, it is difficult to find suitable candidates. The value of physical education talents can be seen from this.</p>

<p>Father—Yes. Humans, whether male or female, are just crystals of dust.</p>

<p>▲A—The young couple who just moved in next door, I find their faces very familiar. I wonder what their names are.</p>
<p>B—They are newlyweds, still in their honeymoon. They just call each other (Darling) and (Dear), so it's impossible to know their names.</p>

<h3 id="e109">A Record of Mr. Li Jianqiu of Jiangyin's Failure in Running Schools <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Xue</p>
<p>Mr. Li Jianqiu (Fu) of Jiangyin was once a scholar during the late Qing Dynasty. He was poor but excelled at painting geese and was proficient in calligraphy and all the arts. Therefore, those seeking his work were numerous. Mr. Li used the income from his writing and painting, in addition to supporting his family, entirely for running schools and purchasing calligraphy, paintings, and antiques. Therefore, his family had no permanent assets. Mr. Li founded two schools, one being Huacheng Middle School and the other being Commercial Middle School. The annual expenses of both schools all came from Mr. Li's own efforts. Mr. Li was truly a dedicated educator.</p>
<p>During the Second Revolution of 1913, the southeast was in turmoil. Mr. Li's writings were not without influence. As a result, by the end of that year, he owed Huacheng teachers and staff over two thousand taels of silver in unpaid salaries. As the lunar year drew to a close, there was no way to raise the funds. The teachers and staff all went to Mr. Li's home to demand payment. Mr. Li was extremely anxious. He had no choice but to take six paintings of eagles by Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty from his family's collection and go to Sheng Xingsun in Wujin to sell them. Upon arriving, he had to go through various people to present the paintings to Mr. Sheng. Mr. Sheng looked at the paintings but did not indicate whether he wanted to buy them or not. Instead, he summoned Mr. Li and asked about the paintings' origins. Mr. Li said that the history before the Ming Dynasty was unknown. During the Ming Dynasty, they belonged to Yan Song. During the Qing Dynasty, they were kept in the imperial palace. During the Boxer Rebellion, the treasures of the imperial court were scattered and lost. These paintings also circulated outside. He obtained them in the late Guangxu period from an antique shop in Jinling. Mr. Sheng nodded frequently upon hearing this and said, "These are rare treasures. Since you have them, why are you willing to part with them now?" Mr. Li explained his reasons in detail. Mr. Sheng said, "Your dedication is admirable. But how much do you still owe the teachers and staff in salaries?" Mr. Li replied, "Over two thousand taels of silver." Mr. Sheng immediately took out three thousand taels of silver and gave them to Mr. Li, keeping the paintings. Mr. Li received the money, thanked him, and returned home.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Li misunderstood this as a mortgage, believing that if he had the original amount, he could redeem the paintings sooner or later. This was because Mr. Li believed that neither party had mentioned the value of the paintings. The two thousand taels of silver was only the amount he urgently needed, not the asking price. Mr. Sheng's generous gift of three thousand taels of silver was a temporary act of assistance, not an increased price. Therefore, the following autumn, Mr. Li raised over three thousand taels of silver and went to redeem the paintings. However, Mr. Sheng was surprised and said, "This is a sale, how can it be redeemed? Moreover, the item has already been given away, so it is impossible to comply." Mr. Li was shocked upon hearing this and repeatedly asked people to intercede, but to no avail. Mr. Sheng only agreed to return one thousand taels. Mr. Li knew that he could not salvage the situation, so he took the money and returned home in tears. Upon returning, he told people, "If I had known this would happen, I would have asked for a reasonable price in the first place. But the value is more than just these meager three thousand taels." He was filled with remorse. This matter has been weighing on him for over ten years. Every time he talks about it with people, he is often moved to tears.</p>
<p>The above story was told to me by Mr. Lu Sugong of Jiangyin. Lu and Li were well acquainted and shared the same ideals.</p>

<p>— Ji Jin</p>
<p>During the Ghost Festival, it is customary to perform the Flame-Mouth Ceremony. Ordinary monks are extremely busy. In reality, they use this to collect money and spread superstition. I remember Mr. Wu Zhihui, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, had a couplet that said, "Soliciting alms for ghosts, either worshiping Li or praying to Zhang, collecting sesame seeds to fill a bushel, doing good deeds according to one's ability, not competing for more, not disliking less, just lighting candles and chanting scriptures." He also said, "Humming a few sentences for the public to hear, if not for an outstanding monk, how could he be invited to the seat, scraping together a few coins for immediate use, as long as the money arrives, why not use this opportunity to set up a stage?" The language is humorous and reasonable. I record it here to substantiate this discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Pillowside News by Wang Mei Ju <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>I got up early to draft a piece for the Free Talk section. Just as I was about to send it, my friend Mr. Wu arrived. Upon seeing the title, he laughed and said, "News on the sea, even if it's just a second old, is as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. But how did you get it on your pillow? Did you perhaps dream of Handan and borrow Lu Sheng's magic pillow? Or did you get a jade pillow divinely bestowed like Shen Zong?" I said, "Not so. Last Tuesday, I was slightly ill for three days. Relatives and friends in Shanghai all came to inquire, and each shared the latest news to alleviate my boredom. Today, I got up from my illness and compiled it as follows." After reading it, my friend also said it was worth keeping.</p>
<p>▲It Was I Who Came Not in Spring—On the second day of my illness, my friend Cai Bomin came in the late afternoon. He didn't know I was ill. He said with surprise, "Fortunately, I didn't go with you to the Three Stars Temple magic show the other day." I said that even if I had gone, it wouldn't have caused me to get sick. He said, "No, it's not like that. That day, you didn't go. I was fascinated by Zhang Huichong's water escape trick and knew that the Three Stars performance was only for one day, so I eagerly went. The audience was also eagerly looking forward to it. But just as it was about to begin, a sign suddenly appeared on the stage saying that the glass of the water tank was broken and could not be performed. The crowd was in an uproar. Then the broken glass was placed on the stage, and the curtain was closed. The crowd became even more agitated, clamoring for refunds, but to no avail. They dispersed in disappointment." I laughed and said, "If I had gone with you, then the line 'It was I who came not in spring' wouldn't have been yours alone to lament."</p>
<p>▲Where Did the Heavenly Maiden Come From?—My nephew-in-law Tang Songyuan also came to inquire. I said, "My illness should be getting better soon, but I'm bored because there's no news." Songyuan said, "If you hadn't mentioned it, I would have forgotten. Recently, someone from my hometown (Songyuan is from Hangzhou) said that there is a girl in a family in Xiashicheng, who is eight years old. She is naturally clever and beautiful, but she has an unusual appearance. Her parents keep her hidden and don't let her see anyone. Occasionally, close relatives see her and notice that she has plasters on her cheeks, like big coins. People in Hangzhou are superstitious. Her mother recently believed what a shaman said, that she was born with it and should not hide her true appearance. So she no longer hid her deeply, and the plasters were removed. There are patterns on her cheeks like flowers, complete with branches and leaves, and even pots. The patterns are deep and have artistic meaning. The mother even told people that it's all over her body." I laughed and said, "I suspect it's nonsense if I haven't seen it with my own eyes." Songyuan strongly asserted that it was true. In that case, where did this scattering heavenly maiden come from?</p>

<p>— Yang Tian</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Nanjing Road China National Products United Emporium, almost two months have passed. The interior layout is well-organized. The goods on display are mostly of good quality and reasonably priced. All sectors are happy to purchase them, so business is thriving. This is also good news in the movement to promote national products. Considering that visitors had no entertainment, the emporium began on the twelfth of last month to hang riddles in the public lounge on the second floor every night, offering national products as prizes to those who guessed correctly. Mr. Liu Wan'an, Cao Chigong, Wu Lianzhou, and Xue Hanmei were invited to manage the events. Later, due to various commitments, they could not be present every night, so it was changed to hanging lanterns three times a week, on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. When the lanterns are lit, colorful banners are displayed. The clever riddle-solvers are happy to come and return full of prizes. I was asked by the gentlemen in charge to write some riddles.

<h3 id="e113">Dissent of the Roman Curia Regarding Chinese Customs (Continued) <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Li Liu Zeng, Sent from Paris</p>
<p>At this time, the Jesuit order in Paris gradually lost ground. In 1708, a man named Malebranche published a work fiercely criticizing Chinese customs, which attracted much attention at the time. The Roman side was also completely controlled by the Dominican order. At the beginning of 1708, a Jesuit priest named Provana returned from China, carrying a letter from Emperor Kangxi and records of previous declarations and arbitrations issued to teachers of both orders. He requested an audience with the Pope. Pope Clement XI not only refused to meet him but also immediately officially published the Church's accusations against Chinese customs, which had been secretly delivered to the special envoy to China, Tournon, in 1704.</p>
<p>At that time, public opinion was extremely interested in the Chinese customs issue, which had caused endless disputes. Discussions took place everywhere, and there was no consensus. In order to end the dispute, the Pope, on September 25, 1710, ordered by the Tribunal of the Holy Office that anyone who discussed this issue without special permission would be excommunicated. This order is the most recent order by the Tribunal of the Holy Office to reaffirm its validity. The matter has passed two centuries since then. According to the July 25 POsservatore romano, many people recently doubted whether this 1710 order was still valid. Therefore, the cardinals of the Holy See gathered on the 18th to reaffirm its value.</p>
<p>Looking at the course of this matter, the Holy See lightly believed one side's words and arbitrarily slandered traditional Chinese customs with a dogmatic attitude, which is truly regrettable. We should know that the struggle between the Dominican order and the Jesuit order, although nominally a religious issue, was actually a struggle between France and Spain for political power in China. The successful position of the Jesuit order in China was the basis for French colonization in China. Not only did the Spanish not want this, but the Roman Curia was also deeply uneasy about the possibility that all religious authority in China would be controlled by the French. The Jesuit order, supported by the French government, disregarded the Pope's orders. From this, we can see the divisions within the Catholic Church. The so-called Pope is merely a figurehead.</p>
<p>For two hundred years, Catholic power in China was entirely protected by France, with little direct relationship with the Holy See. Recently, since the Italian government and the Vatican signed a treaty, the Pope, with a more stable foundation for the Holy See, has gradually intended to reclaim Catholic power in China from the hands of the French. Why was this ban on Chinese customs, issued in 1710, suddenly brought up? Why did the Holy See reaffirm it? There must be some political background in it, which cannot be viewed simply as a simple religious issue.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Heartwarming Thoughts (271) <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Green Bamboo Tears Stain Her Face, Brokenhearted; Red Lotus Fragrance Fades, a Maiden's Soul Leaves</p>
<p>Cuiyun thought, for the sake of the old master, she shouldn't argue anymore, right? What happened before was certainly hateful. But now, she is childless, having not given birth to a son or daughter, which is also very pitiful. Who knew that as Cuiyun began to feel a little free and comfortable, she suffered another major illness. People in their circle of the Qu Garden were most afraid of getting sick. Originally, sending invitations to summon flowers and calling for singers was very lively. After a few calls, when it was said that she was still not well, the guests became scarce. Or they would go and find another establishment. If they had their own small house, they could recover from their illness there. But Cuiyun didn't have her own house, so she spent her days groaning in a small attic. At first, a few guests came to check on her, but when they entered her room, a smell of medicine mixed with the smell of illness made people uncomfortable. In Chinese sickrooms, the windows are always closed tightly, so the air inside is even worse. Adding to that the patient's pale and emaciated face, frowning and bitter expression, which made people uncomfortable, people regarded her room as a dangerous place. So, in the latter half of her illness, let alone anyone making advances, not even a ghost would visit her door. She suffered from typhoid fever for a full month. But the business for the next quarter had to be struggled for. If she were to rest for a quarter, where would the expenses come from? Fortunately, her illness gradually improved, but after the illness, her appearance was haggard. Even her hair fell out like autumn leaves, revealing sparse patches on her head. Who would spend money to see your sick face? After enduring for a month or two, her body gradually recovered, and she became even more energetic and full of spirit than before her illness. Business slowly recovered. When Zuo Shichen met her, it was two or three months after she had recovered from her illness. Later, Cuiyun married someone, and after that, Zuo Shichen no longer contacted her. It turned out that the man Cuiyun married was also a businessman from Shanghai. His ancestral home was Ningbo, but he had been in Shanghai for many years. Since Shanghai opened up as a trading port, people from two places have been the most successful. They each have their own strong vigor in the business world. One place is Guangdong, and the other is Ningbo. Although the people of Guangdong have strong assets and are skilled at maneuvering, their pioneering and rugged efforts are far inferior to those of the Ningbo people. Moreover, they are willing to endure hardship. Often, those who arrive in Shanghai wearing a simple blue cloth gown become famous in the business world in less than ten years. This is because they have the courage to be enterprising. At first, they willingly endure humiliation, but once they gain power, they extend their power. Therefore, many come from humble backgrounds, such as being a Western servant, a groom, or a lighterman. But once they have an opportunity, they can seize it and use it for their own benefit. Originally, "heroes are not afraid of low origins." Even emperors have risen from humble origins. How much more so for businessmen?</p>

<h3 id="e115">Gold Market Recovers with Color <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>▲Excellent Trend—Yesterday, the gold market rebounded, with good momentum. From morning to noon, there were five taels and sixty-seven mace worth of buy-backs. The foreign exchange market was also tight. Banks slightly sold off, and brokers' demands varied. However, major players were reluctant to sell. For example, Yuan Maoyong, Yuan Cheng, and Yong Fuchang all bought in, while the sellers were only Yuansheng, Hengxing, Shunli, and Wanxing. Although the early market was strong, the silver price only rose slightly, especially as the U.S. seemed to be selling off. Therefore, the industry had a firm and profitable mentality, and the market opened higher. Afterwards, buyers were extremely active, pushing the price above sixty taels. At noon, the price weakened slightly, with fluctuations of one or two taels. In the afternoon, the market closed as usual on Saturdays.</p>
<p>▲A Good Rebound of Six Taels and Three Mace—The morning opening in October rose by two taels and two mace, to 558 taels and six mace. However, the silver block had already risen by sixteen and three-eighths, the silver price increased by one-eighth, and the exchange rate fell by one-sixteenth, which did not affect the market. This was because the European market seemed to be softening. Subsequently, Yuan Maoyong, Yuan Cheng, and Yong Fuchang bought aggressively, suddenly pushing the price above sixty taels, reaching 62 and a half taels. Then it retreated by more than one tael, as Wanxing and others sold off. The opening price was unchanged, at 61 taels and eight mace to two mace. Then it rebounded by one tael, to 61 taels. By 10 o'clock, buyers were constantly entering the market, and the gold price was firm. Taiwan sold off 1.255 taels of October gold. Citibank also made an advance in the December Yen-Dollar exchange rate, at 49 yuan and 32 and nine-tenths cents. The market was active, with a sudden rise of three taels, to 64 taels and two mace. But afterwards, sellers entered the market. Moreover, China Bank sold off seven and a half pence of November British gold. Mitsui also released 1.26 taels of recent Dalian gold. Therefore, the price fell by two taels. At 11 o'clock, it was around 62 taels. In an instant, it rose again by one tael and five or six mace, to three taels and forty-five mace. However, the market situation was unclear, and Hengxing and others sold off, so it dropped again by one tael, to 62 taels and forty-five mace. By noon closing, it was 62 taels and seven mace, a rebound of six taels and three mace compared to the previous day, a reaction after two consecutive days of decline.</p>
<p>▲Depressed at Fifty Taels—The maximum price in the half-day was 64 taels and two mace, and the minimum price was 58 taels and a half, a fluctuation of 5 taels and 7 mace. The opening price was 611 taels and 4 mace, initially depressed at 50 taels, and at noon at 48 or 49 taels. However, compared to last Saturday, the depression was more than 20 taels less. The book was 70 taels to 63 taels, and the supplementary water was 74 taels. The early market for goods was 59 taels and two mace, and the noon closing was 62 taels and seven mace.</p>
<p>▲Indeterminate Inflow and Outflow—The inflows and outflows of various firms were erratic. Fuchang, Yuan Chengyong, Yuan Maoyong, Zhifengyong, Yifengyong, Xieyu, and Yuan Dayong had all bought in. Yuxingyong, Yuancheng, Hengxing, Yuanda, Wanxing, and Shunli had all sold off. Dadecheng, Chunfayong, Yu Da, and Yuan Xingyong had mixed inflows and outflows. Hedging firms mostly had more inflows than outflows. The Dalian gang bought more than 300 bars and sold more than 1,000 bars for hedging. The Guangdong gang sold slightly, it is said.</p>

<p>▲Caused by Rumors of U.S. Sale of Silver Blocks</p>
<p>Yesterday, Saturday, the foreign exchange market was open for half a day as usual. HSBC's listed exchange rates were unchanged, but the overseas silver market seemed to have a slightly different trend. Although they all rose, the market fell, due to rumors that the U.S. intended to sell silver blocks. Therefore, British, American, Japanese, and other currencies in Shanghai bank's internal markets showed excellent trends. The gold market also reacted, breaking through the 560 tael mark. Speculators generally had an upward mentality, with demand generally exceeding supply. Transactions for various currencies among Chinese merchants were still active, but there were no large transactions. Tens of thousands of pounds of British gold were settled, with Guangbang Shengsheng chasing in, and Huabi and East Asia selling out. The banks mutually made two or three tens of thousands of pounds, and also traded more than 100,000 U.S. dollars. There was little inflow and outflow of Japanese gold, with only the Dalian gang settling 1 million Dalian dollars for hedging. Banks such as Taiwan, Mitsui, and Sumitomo sold off. By noon closing, British gold had shrunk by 1.875 compared to the previous day. The market was solid, and the market sentiment turned from bad to good. However, Citibank made an advance in the December Yen-Dollar exchange rate, at 49 yuan and 28125.</p>

<p>According to a London telegram yesterday, the silver market continued to rise. Chinese buyers were active, with small transactions. Buyers were satisfied. The U.S. sold off slightly, so the closing price weakened. The near and far term both rose by 1875, both to 16 pence and 75 (equivalent to 1 shilling and 7 pence and 8125 in British gold).

<h3 id="e120">Yarn, Cotton, and Cotton Yarn Markets Trend Upward <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market turned upward, mainly because American cotton rebounded, leading to slightly stronger confidence. The market atmosphere stabilized, and Ruidi, a major short seller, purchased a large amount to cover their positions, driving up the market. However, spot yarn sales have become increasingly quiet, with no transactions from various groups. According to some sources, most of the goods shipped by the Guangdong group the day before were stored locally and not moving. Local inventory prices are gradually increasing, reportedly around 130,000 to 140,000 bales. Therefore, the Guangdong group, seeing the unfavorable situation, closed out their forward yarn positions in Shanghai, selling a lot recently. The future of the yarn market still depends on actual demand.</p>
<p>▲Large Human Label Operators Cover Shorts: The human label market opened with a stronger atmosphere due to rising American cotton and fewer sellers. Large operators covered their short positions, tightening the market further. Prices for all months rose by 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, and 0.09 yuan. In the afternoon, due to positive news about American cotton, buying interest was stronger, but actual sales were sluggish, and prices for all months rose again by 0.02 or 0.05 yuan. Total transactions for the day were 17,150 bales. Sold: Hanfeng 1,200 bales, Lichang 1,200 bales, Dafeng 900 bales, Daji 1,000 bales, Dachangcheng 750 bales, Shenji Dafu and Shen Taisheng Kang Shenchang Shen Yuyi Kang Heng Defu He Yi Chengzhang Feng Yiyu Xincheng 200 to 450 bales. Purchased: Ruidi 3,550 bales, Zhenda 1,200 bales, Yongchang 700 bales, Jifeng Hengyi Yuda Gongtai Tongyu Rongxing Sen Kang Taichang Hengchang Xingyuan 500 to 350 bales. The closing prices for human labels are recorded below:</p>

<p>▲Spot Yarn Increasingly Sluggish: Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. Total purchases by various groups for the day were 547 bales, including 285 bales among peers, with prices down 0.055 yuan. Among customer groups, Sichuan purchased 200 bales, Nanyang 85 bales, mainland China 80 bales, Xuzhou 60 bales, Luzhou 35 bales, Hankou 25 bales, and miscellaneous groups 95 bales.</p>

<p>▲Good News for American Cotton · Unpredictable Weather:</p>
<p>The cotton market is firm again, mainly due to the rise in American cotton and the unpredictable weather, which has tightened confidence. Buying interest has increased sharply, coupled with Ruidi covering shorts. In the afternoon, news that the next production report for American cotton is expected to decrease further tightened sentiment, and buying pressure increased further. However, some Han groups sold slightly due to high prices, while factories still had no intention to transact, and actual sales remained sluggish.</p>
<p>▲Han Standard Up 0.045 Yuan: The Han standard market opened with rising American cotton and continuous rain, increasing buyers. Prices rose by 0.03 yuan. In the afternoon, Ruidi covered shorts and news about American cotton was favorable for long positions, further strengthening the market. Prices for all months rose by 0.005 to 0.01 yuan. Total transactions for the day were 36,900 dan. Purchased: Ruidi 2,400 dan, Yuchang 2,300 dan, Yuanda 2,000 dan, Tianchang Yicheng Jifeng Maoji Gengfeng Dafeng 900 to 800 dan.

<p>▲Southern United States Still Has Cotton Hoarding Movement</p>
<p>▲Manufacturers Pay Attention to Contracts for 1923</p>
<p>A telegram dated the 5th reports on the cotton market situation for the week: The increase in short selling in the South at the beginning of the week and the loosening of actual positions caused cotton prices to fall. However, when the price of new cotton for October delivery fell to around 11 cents, short covering stopped the decline. Subsequently, due to the lack of weakness in futures and continued hoarding in the South, prices recovered. However, before the release of the Department of Agriculture's report, many began to sell, resulting in price fluctuations. Private estimates of cotton production range from 52.4% to 56.0% under normal conditions, with harvests ranging from 13,420,000 bales to 14,664,000 bales. Therefore, people are increasingly uncertain about the government's estimated quantity for next Monday. Many areas in the South are suffering from local drought, and it is also heard that Eastern cotton is underdeveloped and that yields in Louisiana and Texas are poor.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the Department of Agriculture's cotton production report is predicted to average around 14 million bales, with some short covering as a result. The South continues to show a hoarding trend. Domestic piece goods trade has slightly better demand. Manufacturers are now paying attention to contracts for 1923 goods.</p>

<p>▲Chinese and British Yarn Increases, Japanese Yarn Decreases</p>
<p>According to a survey by Japanese firms, the yarn inventory at the end of August was 132,024 bales, an increase of 13,799 bales compared to the previous month. Chinese and British factory yarn accounted for 123,279 bales, an increase of 16,249 bales compared to the previous month. Japanese factory yarn accounted for 4,745 bales, a decrease of 2,450 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Grains: Foreign Rice and Ke Xian Rice Sales are Both Sluggish <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>▲Foreign Rice: The market was even more sluggish yesterday, with no sales from either the Northern or Southern groups. There were also no inquiries from Zhejiang or the mainland. The small-grained rice returned from Hankou has yet to find a buyer. Fortunately, the inventory is very small, so prices have not fallen sharply. The overall market saw only Min Dang of this street purchase 100 bags, Saigon No. 1 100 bags, and small-grained brown rice 100 bags.</p>
<p>▲Ke Xian Rice: Ke Xian rice from Jiangxi and Hunan continues to arrive. Because Ke Xian rice is not moving, the market remains dull. However, sales from this street have gradually improved after the flat price system was gradually abolished. Purchasing power in the market is also better than last month. Although the arriving Ke Xian rice is not moving, this street and the countryside still have an appetite, so the market has been able to stand firm. It is estimated that over 1,000 bags of early Jiangxi machine rice and 500 bags of late machine rice were sold. Hunan Jinggang rice 390 bags. Sales prices for each commodity are listed in the market price table.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Flour Market Shows a Lively Trend <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month showed a firm and lively trend. Because foreign wheat quotations rebounded by 0.05, 0.06, or 0.07 yuan, sentiment has turned from sluggish to stable. The enthusiastic bulls believe that the ban on sales to the North will hopefully be lifted in the next few days. Therefore, the bulls for this month believe that once the North is open for sales, the quiet market can definitely turn active. Therefore, buying interest was very strong for a time, and the prices for each month in the coming period were also raised. Observing this phenomenon, it is possible that factories with goods will have to continue to hold up prices for this month because foreign flour cannot be shipped in any way. In the afternoon, the atmosphere for each month remained stable, but showed a fluctuating trend, with little increase in prices. As a result, prices for this month and October each rose by 0.0175 yuan, November rose by 0.015 yuan, December and January rose by 0.0075 yuan, and February rose by 0.0125 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Recent Wheat Slightly Recovered <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the afternoon, the market for each month had turned stable. Because foreign wheat quotations rebounded and wheat flour was about to be opened for sale to the North, sentiment for both near-term and long-term wheat was raised. Although there is a large stock of current wheat for this month and the factory appetite is not very good, it should be seen as flat and weak in theory. However, because the standards cannot be met, most of the wheat cannot be delivered. Therefore, some of the short positions are still being covered at any time, so the market is still being held up. As a result, this month is up 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day, November is up 0.01 yuan, January is up 0.01 yuan, and the rest are unchanged. Various factories are still holding on to current wheat and have no intention to move. Only Huafeng ate 2,000 bags of Xuzhou Dangshan wheat, with the price nearly 0.01 yuan lower than a few days ago.</p>
<h3 id="e131">The Sugar Market Sees Sluggish Buying Interest in Raw and White Sugar <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>▲Japanese Car Sugar Transactions are Also Few</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market information from the production area: Cuban spot sugar prices remain at 1.15625. New York sugar futures for September are priced at 1.10, down 0.02 yuan from the previous telegram. December is 1.18, March next year is 1.29, and May is 1.38, each down 0.01 yuan from the previous telegram. Java spot sugar prices are 8.875, October sugar futures are 8.75, and November is 8.50, remaining unchanged from the previous telegram. In the exchange market, buying interest in Dutch sugar No. 24 raw and white sugar was sluggish, and transactions were scattered. The price for ordinary oil bag goods was 8.00 taels, and the market appeared weak. There were no transactions for medium white sugar. Japanese sugar transactions were also few, but the market saw a slight increase due to multiple parties pushing up prices. N Mark 8.15 taels, YT Mark 8.10 taels, YP 8.20 taels, scattered demand, YRO Mark shouted 8.00 taels, SH Mark 8.05 taels, lacking inquiries. The market remains stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Shanghai foreign firm silk market continued to be dull. Overseas markets have sent telegrams complaining that Shanghai's yellow and white silk, etc., are too expensive due to the cheap competition from Japanese silk, and there have been no inquiries. Only Hulin entered five packages of Longma brand top-grade Shanghai white factory silk, with 13 to 22 filaments, at a price of only 980 taels. The rest were all silent.</p>
<h3 id="e133">New York Japanese Silk Prices Continue to Fall <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>▲Factories Seek to Reduce Costs · Japanese Merchants Compete at Low Prices</p>
<p>Recently, the New York market has been increasingly lifeless. Since the economic downturn, each silk weaving factory has been striving to reduce costs for its products. Raw silk materials are generally only purchased when cheap, resulting in dull and lifeless silk sales. Japanese silk merchants cater to the psychology of the factories and sell Japanese silk cheaply, making silk prices even lower. At the beginning of the month, A-grade Japanese silk was only priced at US$3.30 per pound, B-grade at US$2.80, and C-grade at US$2.25.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the interest of Wu Yuan Gaozhuang Zhenmei, Dudu, Tianxiang, and Jinlong firms remained strong. Overall market transactions were not sluggish, and the market showed a slightly firm trend. However, medium and low-grade tea remained stagnant. Gongxi green tea and Russian firm tea have not moved. Baitouzhuang tea also remained mostly in observation. The overall trend remains poor.</p>

<p>San Zhang Big Guangzhou Leather has been procured frequently by the military recently, leading to a shortage of spot goods in the market. The market was searched yesterday and was very scarce. Prices soared by 0.03 or 0.04 yuan, with Xinzhong at 9.35 taels. However, there are still many buyers.</p>

<h3 id="e152">City Party Headquarters Prepares to Commemorate the Premier's First Uprising <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>September 9th is the anniversary of the Premier's first uprising. The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters has specifically scheduled a commemorative meeting to be held at 9:00 AM on this day at the Xiaoximen Youth Propaganda Group in the South City. Party headquarters, agencies, and groups at all levels in the city must send four representatives to attend at the designated time.</p>
<p>Today</p>
<h3 id="e153">Citywide Special Martial Law <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>▲Strict Defense in Both the Chinese and Foreign Concessions</p>
<p>Today is the 9/7 commemoration, and military and police defenses have been strengthened. A special martial law has been declared throughout the city. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Garrison Command Office Operates Day and Night The Songhu Garrison Command has decided to follow the May 1st method, ordering its affiliated military and police agencies to comply. Although today is a regular Sunday holiday, the department will still operate as usual. The two departments of the staff and adjutant are primarily responsible, and there is no rest day or night.</p>
<p>▲Two Railways Police Extra Patrols Kong Fanjun, the police chief of the Beijing-Shanghai and Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, specifically telegraphed each section police chief of the two railways yesterday, saying: Today's commemoration has arrived again, and it is feared that reactionary elements will take the opportunity to riot. Now that military affairs on the front lines are progressing, it is sincerely feared that the rebel army will collude with reactionaries to disturb the rear. The two railways are important for transportation, and bridges and roads should be strictly guarded. From 6:00 AM on the 7th to 6:00 PM on the 8th, stop resting and return to patrol. All must be armed and diligently patrol, without the slightest slack. Be sure to comply with this order.</p>
<p>▲Defense of the British and French Concessions The military and police agencies in the city have been ordered to take precautions, so since yesterday, the defenses in the north and south of the city have been greatly strengthened. The iron gates along the Chinese border in the Public Concession and the French Concession have only opened one gate in areas with more pedestrian traffic to allow vehicles to pass through. The iron gates in other secluded alleyways are all closed. Fei, the chief inspector of the French Concession Police Department, sent a large number of workers yesterday to carry the barbed wire frames to the Avenue Edward VII along the border between the British and French concessions, such as the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue de Montigny, the intersection of West New Bridge Street, the intersection of Rue de l'Arquebuse, the intersection of East New Bridge Street, the intersection of Rue du Père Huc, and the intersection of Rue de la Cathédrale, etc., and placed them on the sidewalks on both sides. The iron gates at the road intersections in the Xujiahui Bridge West Gate and the Avenue de la République along the Chinese-French border have all been selectively closed, and additional Chinese and Vietnamese police have been dispatched to patrol back and forth without stopping.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Wang Zhengting Went to Hangzhou Yesterday <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>▲The Takeover of Weihaiwei Will Not Be Delayed</p>
<p>▲The British Envoy May Come to Beijing on the 8th to Negotiate</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting arrived in Shanghai by express train from Beijing at 9:00 PM the night before. At 10:00 AM yesterday, he went to the Foreign Affairs Discussion Association office on Avenue Joffre to meet with Wu Tianfang, assistant to the Intelligence Department, and Xu Zushan, the commissioner of the Foreign Ministry preparing for the takeover of Weihaiwei. According to Wang's statement to this newspaper's reporter, the takeover of Weihaiwei will definitely take place on October 1st. In any case, it will not be delayed. The rumors are completely untrustworthy. British Minister Lampson set off from Beidaihe on the 5th and is coming south. He will arrive in Beijing on the 8th to discuss this matter with me, as well as the issue of recovering the British Concession in Xiamen. As for the takeover method, the Foreign Ministry has prepared everything properly and is just waiting for the National Government to appoint a commissioner. The Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations are being handled jointly by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications. The Foreign Ministry is currently in contact with the Ministry of Communications, and there is no definite date for the meeting. There have been no new developments in the Sino-Russian negotiations, and so on. Xu Zushan also said that I went to Weihaiwei for more than a month and repeatedly contacted Johnson, the British Weihaiwei Commissioner, to negotiate the takeover procedures and details, and we have already agreed on everything. I have already reported to the Foreign Ministry. As for the Reuters news report that the British Parliament is questioning China's takeover of Weihaiwei, from my personal observation, the U.S. government's right to ratify foreign treaties ultimately rests with Congress. Congress can veto the president's ratification of foreign treaties, but this is not the case in the United Kingdom. Looking at the recent three hundred years of American diplomatic history, although the final ratification right rests with Congress, no matter that has been approved by the British monarch after consulting with the Congressional Foreign Affairs Group has ever been rejected. Therefore, the takeover of Weihaiwei on October 1st will definitely not be extended. The National Government has not yet appointed a takeover commissioner. I am only responsible for diplomatic matters, and so on. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Wang went to Hangzhou with his family for sightseeing and is scheduled to return to Shanghai today. He will go to Beijing that evening to take up his duties. Chinese Taxpayer Association</p>
<h3 id="e155">Important Telegrams Dispatched Yesterday <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>▲ Chinese Directors to Take Over, Report to Government</p>
<p>▲ Special Committee to Deal with Water Prices</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association yesterday, based on the resolution of the delegates' conference the day before, issued seven telegrams, recorded as follows: ▲ Regarding the Replacement of Chinese Directors</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to Government Authorities: To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance of the National Government of Nanjing, the Jiangsu Provincial Government of Zhenjiang, the Special Commissioner's Office for Finance of Jiangsu, and the Shanghai Municipal Government: Mr. Bei Songsun, the director representing the Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association to the Shanghai Municipal Council, has been assigned by the Bank of China to inspect banking operations in Europe and America for more than six months. He has requested to resign. Our association convened a delegates' conference on September 5th. Due to the circumstances, we could not retain him. It was resolved that Mr. Bei Songsun's resignation be approved, and a replacement should be elected immediately. As a result of the election, Mr. Hu Mengjia was elected to succeed him as the director to the Shanghai Municipal Council. In addition to separate letters, we hereby telegraph this for your review and record. It is for the public good. Wang Xiaolai and Xu Jilong, Chairmen of the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association, kowtow. (The letter to various local organizations is omitted.)</p>
<p>▲ Letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council: Respectfully, Mr. Bei Songsun, the director representing our association to your council, has resigned due to his departure to inspect banking operations overseas. Mr. Hu Mengjia has now been appointed to succeed him. We hereby inform you and request that you take note of this matter. Addressed to the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>
<p>▲ Regarding the Water Price Increase</p>
<p>▲ Letter to the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council: The association yesterday sent a letter to Mr. Macnaghten, Chairman of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council, stating: Respectfully, the issue of increasing the price of tap water in the Public Concession was discussed at our association's delegates' conference on September 5th. It was resolved that this matter, which increases the burden on residents, needs to be seriously reconsidered. In addition to instructing the Executive Committee to form a special committee for thorough research, we request that your council suspend the implementation of the proposed price increase to comply with the public opinion of the residents. We specially record this matter and send it to you, hoping for your review and action, and we look forward to your response.</p>
<p>▲ Letter to the Five Chinese Directors: Another letter was sent to the Chinese directors Yuan Ludeng, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Liu Hongsheng, and Hu Mengjia, stating: Respectfully, the issue of increasing the price of tap water in the Public Concession was discussed at our association's delegates' conference on September 5th. It was resolved that (1) this matter, which increases the burden on residents, needs to be seriously reconsidered, and a letter should be sent to the Municipal Council to suspend the implementation of the proposed price increase; (2) the Shanghai Real Estate Association should be informed that new water contracts should still be calculated at the old price; (3) detailed countermeasures should be submitted to the Executive Committee to form a special committee for review and action. In addition to separate notifications, we hereby record this matter and send it to you, hoping for your review and action.</p>
<p>▲ Reply to the Shanghai Real Estate Association: Respectfully replying, we received your letter stating that the 25% increase in the price of tap water in the Public Concession, implemented since September 1st, has a significant and profound impact on the lives of millions of residents in the concession. You have listed the reasons and opinions against it, and requested our assistance. Upon review, this matter was proposed for opposition by Committee Member Chu Fucheng at the Executive Committee meeting of our association on August 29th. After discussion, it was decided that due to the importance of the matter, it should be submitted to the delegates' conference for a decision. Upon receiving your letter, it was submitted to the delegates' conference on the 5th of this month. It was agreed that the increase in tap water prices would increase the burden on residents and that it was necessary to seriously reconsider the matter. A letter should be sent to the Municipal Council to suspend the implementation of the price increase. At the same time, the Shanghai Real Estate Association should be informed that all new water contracts should still be calculated based on the 6% water price. The detailed countermeasures were to be submitted to the Executive Committee to form a special committee for review and action. In addition to informing the Municipal Council and convening the Executive Committee, we hereby record this matter and reply, hoping that your association will notify all members that all new water contracts should still be calculated at the old price. This is our sincere hope.</p>
<p>▲ Regarding Chinese Directors and Tap Water</p>
<p>▲ Letter to All Executive Committee Members: Respectfully, it is hereby decided to convene the Executive Committee at 4:00 PM on the 8th of this month at the association's building at No. 4 Hong Kong Road to discuss the following two important matters: (A) Mr. Hu Mengjia, a standing committee member of our association, has been elected by the delegates' conference to replace the Chinese director to the Shanghai Municipal Council, leaving a vacancy in the standing committee, which should be filled immediately; (B) The proposed increase in the price of tap water in the Public Concession has been resolved by the delegates' conference to be submitted to the Executive Committee to form a special committee for detailed review and countermeasures. The above two matters, one concerning the internal organization of our association and the other concerning the increased burden on residents, are both of extreme importance. We earnestly hope that you will attend the meeting on time to facilitate progress. We await your presence.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Special District to Start Selling Rice <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>▲ Sales Start on the 9th at the Tianhou Temple</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Market Regulation Committee is procuring rice to be sold in the special district of the concessions. It is reported that Mr. Lu Wenshao, a leader in the rice industry, has made arrangements. The sales location is the old site of the Tianhou Temple on North Henan Road. The municipal party headquarters has instructed the three district party headquarters to borrow the location. At the same time, the municipal rice merchant association has appointed Wang Weiquan, Lu Shaolian, Lu Guishan, Ge Peiyuan, and Luo Zipei to be responsible for the affairs there. The price of the rice is currently set at 380 copper coins per liter, equivalent to about 13 yuan per stone, which is about 3 yuan cheaper than the market price. Each person can buy a maximum of five dou and a minimum of two sheng. The sales hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

<h3 id="e157">Discovery of Genuine Cholera <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>▲ Citizens Must Be Cautious About Hygiene</p>
<p>This summer, the incidence of epidemics in Shanghai was rare, and the number of outpatients at various epidemic hospitals was significantly lower than in previous years. Genuine cholera was also not found. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of autumn, the dreaded cholera has been found. Yesterday, the Shanghai Red Cross Society's epidemic hospital found a patient named Jin Fuquan. The results of the examination by the Shanghai Municipal Council's health department confirmed that he had genuine cholera. The examination report has been sent to the hospital. It is reported that the hospital admitted two more patients yesterday, also similar to cholera, but the examination reports from the health department have not yet been received. It is also reported that several cases have been found in the Hongkou Epidemic Hospital.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Record of the Municipal District Planning Committee <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Organization Law has been promulgated for some time, and the division of districts is indeed an important matter within the city. The law stipulates that it must be completed within three months after the promulgation of the law. The municipal government believes that Shanghai should also prepare for this, so it appointed Councilor Xu Peihuang and others as committee members. The first meeting was held at the municipal government at 9:00 AM yesterday. All committee members and representatives attended the meeting. Xu Peihuang was elected as chairman and declared the meeting open. The matters decided after separate discussions are mainly: (1) The district division work must be completed within two months from today; (2) The city has a dense population, and the original system of five households per neighborhood is not applicable. It is necessary to request the Ministry of Interior to make changes based on the special circumstances; (3) The number of households must be verified if there are discrepancies, and July should be used as the standard month; (4) Boat dwellers, except for those with land-based residences, should be distributed based on the survey results; (5) Two groups will be formed: a general affairs group and a survey group. The members of the various bureaus of the municipal government belong to the general affairs group, and the members of the various municipal affairs committees or their representatives and the members of the public security bureau belong to the survey group. The discussion that day strictly followed the law and facts, and everyone tried their best to clarify the true meaning until after 12:00 PM before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Reorganization Plan for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>▲ Li Zhonggong to Return to Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>Li Zhonggong plans to go to Shanghai on the 9th or 10th, but the date of his assumption of office has not yet been decided. Of the nine members of the reorganization committee, the government will first appoint four or five, and the rest will be filled by those from Shanghai's industrial, shipping, and banking sectors who are willing to cooperate. The reorganization plan, whether it is government-run, commercially-run, a joint government-commercial venture, or government-supervised commercial operation, must choose the most appropriate option. The prerequisite is that one party must value national operations, and the other party must consider the rights of commercial shareholders. As for the back wages of employees and overdue interest coupons, which are related to the livelihood of employees and external credit, huge sums of money must first be raised to pay them separately. In the future, more than one million yuan must be raised each month to cope with the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Hearing on the Jin Li Yuan Case Yesterday <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>▲ French Side Has No Reply Regarding Lease Renewal and Purchase</p>
<p>▲ China Merchants Bureau Sent Letter to French Consul-General Yesterday to Make a Statement</p>
<p>▲ The San De Tang Should Be Responsible for the Delay in Negotiations</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau is in dispute with the French side over the Jin Li Yuan Wharf case. The negotiations have not progressed smoothly, and the deadline for the French Court to execute the termination of the contract is approaching. The San De Tang should be responsible for the delay. Yesterday, a letter was sent to French Consul-General Ganglering, stating: Respectfully, our bureau's arbitrator, lawyer Gao Shuo, recently stated that on the 1st of this month (i.e., Monday), he and Mr. Lu Bohong visited Father Xia Lou and verbally agreed to send a telegram to the Paris headquarters to request instructions on the selling price. After inquiring by telegram in recent days, it was said that no reply had been received. Our bureau is extremely willing to resolve this matter as soon as possible to promote friendship. Moreover, the deadline of September 15th agreed upon by the former Consul-General is approaching. If the priest has to telegraph Paris for instructions on everything, it may not be possible to resolve the matter within the time limit. The San De Tang should be held responsible for the delay. Please inform the French Court accordingly. This is a special statement. Wishing you good health, this is addressed to French Consul-General Gan. Cai Pei, General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Vigilance in Yangtze River Shipping <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>▲ Shengjing Vessel Fights Bandits in Qizhou: The Taikoo Company's Yangtze River vessel Shengjing, returning to Shanghai from Hankou this time, was attacked by bandits when it was near Wuxue, downstream of Qizhou. It was late at night, and there were many passengers on board, all sound asleep. Suddenly, rifle fire erupted from both banks like a string of pearls, and many passengers were awakened from their dreams. Fortunately, the ship had hired six British sailors and two machine guns in Hankou. The British soldiers opened fire on the bandits on both banks with machine guns for about twenty minutes before the bandits retreated. Although the Shengjing vessel was attacked by bandits, fortunately, no one was injured.</p>
<p>▲ Taishun Vessel Encounters Warning Sound: The China Merchants Bureau's Taishun vessel, traveling upstream from Nanjing to Hankou, was suddenly fired upon by lurking bandits on the banks of the Yangtze River at a place called Zeyin. It was night, so the Taishun vessel turned off its lights and sailed quickly to avoid being targeted by the bandits. Although the hull was hit by several bullets, no one was injured. Foreign warships are now protecting ships from Daye to Hankou, while Chinese ships are installing bulletproof plates to ensure safety.</p>
<p>▲ Hongheng Docks at Shashi: The Sanbei Company received a telegram from Shashi stating that bandits are rampant in the four rural villages there. After the Hongheng vessel arrived in Shashi, it originally planned to return to Hankou immediately, but it has been retained by the merchants and residents of Shashi, who have requested that it remain docked for one more day, so that they can take the ship to Hankou for temporary refuge in case of emergency, to avoid being extorted for huge sums of money by foreign ships. In addition, the company's Wuxing vessel was detained between Wanxian and Yichang for smuggling contraband. It has not been released because the fine of 20,000 yuan has not been paid in full. The Sanbei Company has telegraphed Liu Xiang to order its release.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Red Cross Society's Committee to Revise Articles of Association <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>▲ Fifth Meeting</p>
<p>The China Red Cross Society's Committee to Revise Articles of Association held its fifth meeting at 2:00 PM on the 5th of this month. The members present were Li Zhenbang, Hong Yanbin, Jiang Daqiu, Yang Ke, Wang Peiyuan, Xue Shaoting, Liu Hongsheng, Wen Lanting, Wu Jiasan, Ye Zhisheng, Wang Xiaolai, and other committee members. Chairman Wen Lanting presided over the meeting. After the usual formalities, the minutes of the previous meeting were read, and there were no objections. The chairman signed them. The chairman stated that the articles of association of the Red Cross Society should be presented for the third reading today. Wu Jiasan stated that the name of the association should be changed to the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China. A vote was taken, and the majority approved. The name of the articles of association was changed to the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China, abbreviated as the Chinese Red Cross Society. Article 1 of the articles of association was changed to "This association is an international charitable organization, organized by members of this association, named the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China, abbreviated as the Chinese Red Cross Society." Hong Yanbin stated that Article 6, Item 2, "A nursing school is attached to the general hospital," is inconsistent with Article 5, Item 3, "Training volunteer doctors and nurses." It should be changed to "A volunteer doctor and nurse school is attached to the general hospital." Jiang Daqiu stated that Article 14 should be changed to "The election method of its representatives and the number of representatives to be sent shall be determined separately." Hong Yanbin stated that Article 18 should be changed to "The Executive Committee shall be composed of eleven executive members elected by the standing executive members." In addition, Article 23, Item 3, should be changed to "Specially awarding honorary members, special members, and awarding various medals." Also, the order of the items in Article 24 should be changed to (1) Handling matters with the government and various agencies, (2) Reviewing the qualifications of joining members, (3) Approving the establishment of branches, (4) Supervising the affairs of the branches, (5) Supervising subordinate institutions, (6) Compiling budgets and final accounts. Jiang Daqiu stated that Yang Yao seconded that whether the standing members and executive members are voluntary positions should be clearly stipulated. The majority approved, and Article 28 was changed to "The term of office of the standing council members and executive members is three years, and they can be re-elected, but they are all voluntary positions." Also, Article 30 is not complete and should be changed to "A request from one-fifth or more of the total number of branches or one-tenth or more of the total number of members shall convene an extraordinary meeting." Wu Jiasan stated that the sentence "All are elected by the executive committee members" should be added under Article 19. In Article 30, the sentence "Convened by the Standing Council within six weeks" is too short and should be changed to "two months." Yang Ke stated that the word "purpose" in Article 31 should be changed to "matter." Hong Yanbin stated that the word "money" in Article 38, Item 2, should be changed to "silver." The section on branches reporting all their property to the general association, which then forwards it for record, should be changed to a separate article after Article 53. Jiang Daqiu stated that the word "house" in Article 38, Item 3, should be changed to "property." Hong Yanbin stated that in Articles 45, 46, and 62, "aircraft" should be added to each item where transportation of materials, etc., may require the use of aircraft. In the sentence "The agency that may temporarily submit a request shall handle it in accordance with the military law of the army and navy personnel," the word "air" should be added. Jiang Daqiu stated that Article 47 should be changed to "In the event of war, the term of office of all standing members and executive members may be extended, but not for more than one year." Wu Jiasan stated that branches should receive subsidies from the general association, and this should be retained in the old regulations. The majority approved and changed the old regulations to "They may receive subsidies from the general association and local government offices." Also, Article 54 still needs to be studied. Xue Shaoting seconded, and it was resolved to change it to "Re-appoint representatives to attend the standing council meeting and express their opinions as executive members." Hong Yanbin stated that the sentence "The general rules for branches shall be determined separately" in Article 55 can be deleted and should be changed to after Article 49. Jiang Daqiu stated that the order of Item 4 in Article 56 must be changed to "4. For those who have contributed to the association, medals may be awarded based on their achievements. The above medals must be decided by the standing council." Xue Shaoting stated that the sentence at the end of Article 57, Item 4, should be added with the words "donation," changed to "However, the membership fees and donations paid will not be refunded." Wu Jiasan, Ye Zhisheng, Jiang Daqiu, Hong Yanbin, and Yang Ke spoke successively, stating that Articles 58 and 59 of the supplementary rules should be discussed in detail and properly revised. It was resolved to delete the words "Articles 58 and 59" and change them to "Items 1 and 2." Jiang Daqiu changed them to "(1) These articles of association shall take effect after being approved by the membership meeting and submitted to the government for record; (2) Amendments to these articles of association must be passed by more than half of the representatives attending the national membership meeting." The chairman proposed that the articles of association of the association have been completed with the third reading and that the branch rules and the election method for standing members should be revised immediately. Meetings will continue every day from next Tuesday (September 9th) at 2:00 PM. The meeting adjourned after the discussion, which was already past 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Various Places in Shanghai Purchasing Firearms</p>
<h3 id="e163">Should First Submit to the Ministry of Military Administration for Review <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Municipal Government Yesterday Ordered the Public Security Bureau and Security Corps to Comply</p>
<p>The municipal government yesterday instructed the Public Security Bureau and the Security Corps Reorganization Committee, stating: For compliance with the order, it is hereby ordered that, upon investigation, various provinces, cities, and counties purchasing firearms in Shanghai should first hand over the funds to the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai office for them to order on their behalf, in order to simplify procedures and save costs. This has been divided into orders for the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Military Administration, and the various provincial and municipal governments to comply with. In addition, Directive No. 156 from the National Government has been submitted and approved for record. According to the Ministry of Military Administration's reply, after receiving the order, it should be complied with. However, the Ministry has carefully studied the use of firearms purchased by various provinces and counties, whether the purchase should be approved, and the number of firearms to be approved. It seems that the court should clearly order the various provincial and municipal counties to first consult the Ministry for review, and after the review is completed, the Ministry should submit it to the National Government for approval and issuance of passports. At the same time, consult the Ministry of Finance for review. In this way, the ordering will be more unified and checked, and the ordering will be reviewed before and after. Before receiving the order, in addition to complying with the order, all provinces and cities are requested to clearly order, and in the future, when purchasing firearms, they should first submit the use and number to the Ministry for review before applying for a permit and sending it to the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai office for ordering matters. Whether all the reasons are appropriate should be submitted for review in writing, and it is hoped that instructions will be given for compliance, which is for the public good. Therefore, in addition to ordering approval to be handled as instructed, and ordering the Ministry of Finance and the various provincial and municipal governments to comply with the order, it is also ordered that the municipal government should immediately comply with the order.</p>

<p>Shanghai County Government</p>
<h3 id="e166">Recent Major Policies Implemented <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has recently completed the resolution of the busy season tax collection fee, the re-appointment of charity association directors, and the investigation of the shipping situation. The details of the process are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Resolving the Tax Collection Fee Case: The county government previously received a report from the first district chief, stating that the township chiefs who undertake the busy season tax collection should be given a tax collection fee to ensure responsibility, etc. County Magistrate Yan instructed the Finance Bureau to convene another meeting to discuss the measures. It is reported that the bureau convened more than a dozen people, including the district chiefs of the six districts under the county and the director of the property department, on the afternoon of the 5th to discuss the measures. Bureau Chief Wang presided over the meeting. After the usual formalities, the case was discussed in detail, and the following was resolved: The tax collection fee should be completely transparent, with actual expenses paid for actual use. If there is a surplus, it should all be used as funding for the township office.</p>
<p>▲ Re-Appointing Charity Association Directors: The county government previously approved the consultation from the Songjiang County Government, stating that the term of office of the fourth session of the directors of the old Song Charity Association had expired. It requested the recommendation of the fifth session of directors for reply so that an appointment letter could be sent. County Magistrate Yan appointed Mr. Niu Changyao from the county to serve. The Songjiang County Government was consulted and replied on record. It is now approved that the county has consulted and replied, and an appointment letter for Mr. Niu has been attached. County Magistrate Yan has informed Mr. Niu to check and receive it.</p>
<p>▲ Investigating the Shipping Situation: Construction Bureau Chief Wu stated that the shipping industry is of great importance to transportation. There are quite a few small steamers operating within the county, but the bureau has no record of the organizational status of the various shipping companies, which makes management difficult. Therefore, he specially instructed the department to prepare a form and send it to each small steamer company to fill out in detail and report it promptly for statistics.</p>

<p>National Goods Association L]</p>
<h3 id="e172">Telegram Urging Universal Promotion of National Goods <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association, in order to establish National Goods Maintenance Associations throughout the country, specially sent a telegram to the Executive Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, saying: "We believe that concentrated forces have broad functions, a unified system achieves effective results, and practice is valued, while empty words are useless. Laws emphasize realization, and prestige naturally arises. The matter of promoting national goods in our country has been continuously advocated by the association for the past twenty years, with repeated efforts. Although the words 'national goods' have been deeply engraved in the minds of our compatriots, in reality, the effect is only equivalent to zero. This is because there are no responsible agencies in various provinces, cities, and counties, and publicity is not widespread. Moreover, we observe that the current mindset of our people is due to the weakness of patriotic ideas. Extravagant people have the mentality of admiring foreign goods and despising domestic products. Therefore, the urgent way to save the situation is to first rectify people's hearts and change their ideas, so as to reverse the declining trend and lay the foundation for a strong country. The association has repeatedly contributed its humble opinions, proposing that the government issue an order to all provinces, cities, counties, and villages to establish National Goods Maintenance Associations to be solely responsible for maintaining national goods, so as to revitalize the lost hearts of the people. Unexpectedly, national affairs have changed, the situation has changed, and the promotion of national goods has not only not seen any effect, but has also become like water getting deeper and fire getting hotter. All national goods, industrial, and commercial enterprises are showing signs of decline. In addition, national difficulties are becoming more urgent, and the people's wealth is becoming more exhausted. The times are pressing, the world is dangerous, and the situation is critical. The association, therefore, resolved at the 23rd meeting of the 19th Executive Committee to present a petition to the National Government, ordering all levels of party departments in provinces, cities, counties, villages, and townships across the country to guide the agricultural, industrial, commercial, and student groups under their jurisdiction to organize branches of the China National Goods Maintenance Association within seven days of receiving the document, to proceed uniformly, cooperate fully, and publicize widely, so as to rectify people's hearts and achieve great results. We respectfully send this telegram, earnestly requesting your esteemed office to consider the difficulties of the times, approve its implementation, so as to save the national crisis and alleviate the people's livelihood, and we pray for instructions to obey, for the convenience of the party."</p>

<h3 id="e173">Zhu Ruchao, a Shopkeeper Involved in the Hundred Thousand Yuan Robbery, Commits Suicide <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>▲Suffered a Nervous Breakdown After the Case</p>
<p>▲Attempted Suicide in the Huangpu River Three Days Ago, Was Rescued</p>
<p>▲Cut His Throat with a Kitchen Knife Behind Someone's Back Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>▲Admitted to the Hospital, Life in Danger</p>
<p>The hundred thousand yuan robbery case has been going on for ten days. Since the huge sum was robbed on August 28th, the police have been making every effort to investigate. Three days later, several suspects involved in the case were arrested one after another, sent to the public court, and confessed to the robbery. The details have been recorded in previous reports. However, at around 4:30 AM yesterday morning, Zhu Ruchao, a shopkeeper from the Zhejiang Local Bank in Hangzhou who had escorted the hundred thousand yuan to Shanghai, suddenly committed suicide at the Donglai Bank, cutting his throat with a sharp blade, and his life is in danger. After the case was solved, part of the stolen money has been recovered. Now that Zhu Ruchao suddenly commits suicide, the case has taken another strange turn. Although no one dares to speculate on the reasons for his seeking death, Zhu is nearly sixty years old and has been serving at the Zhejiang Local Bank for nearly seventeen years. Now that he has met with an unexpected disaster and had the intention of dying a violent death, it is indeed tragic.</p>
<p>▲Attempted Suicide by Drowning, But Was Rescued. Zhu Ruchao, the shopkeeper, has been temporarily residing at the Donglai Bank at No. 407 Henan Road since the case occurred, so that the police could question him at any time. However, since being shocked on the way on the 28th, his nerves have been greatly stimulated. He often mutters to himself, walks unsteadily, and lowers his head without speaking. Even those who try to comfort him are ignored. Three days ago, Zhu took advantage of the lack of attention and went to the Huangpu River to drown himself. Fortunately, a passerby saw him and rescued him, preventing him from suffering a violent death. After this incident occurred, the bank, fearing that Zhu's behavior would cause complications, immediately telegraphed Shaoxing, instructing his son to come to Shanghai to take care of him. Who knew that a major disaster would suddenly occur three days later?</p>
<p>▲Suicide by Kitchen Knife. At around 4:30 AM yesterday morning, when it was still dark, Zhu suddenly crept out of his bedroom and went to the kitchen, where he selected the sharpest kitchen knife. He went to the iron gate at the back of the Donglai Bank, facing Tianjin Road, and cut his throat. At this time, the bank's staff and servants were all asleep and did not know anything about it. Even the watchman, a Chinese constable, was sound asleep and did not know about the disaster that was happening. Suddenly, a tea servant sleeping on the second floor heard a cry of agony, lingering in his ears. He felt very strange and listened carefully, realizing that the sound came from downstairs, near the street. He called his companions, put on his clothes, and went downstairs to see what was going on.</p>
<p>▲Terrified the Child. After Zhu cut himself, he fell to the ground in pain, groaning. The first to be awakened by the sound was the cook's son. He slipped on his shoes and followed the sound, seeing Zhu lying under the iron gate at the entrance of the lane, his hands and feet struggling on the ground. His white hair and red blood reflected under the lamplight, and his face was hideous and terrifying. The child was greatly frightened and ran inside, and the people upstairs gathered at this time, asking what happened and panicking. They rushed to Zhu's side, seeing him naked from the waist up, wearing pants, the knife on the ground, the blade covered in blood, a hole in his head, and blood flowing out. They quickly reported to the police and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>▲Esophagus Severed. When he was sent to the hospital, he was already unconscious due to excessive blood loss. The doctor found that his esophagus had been severed, the wound was three inches wide and two inches deep, and his life was in great danger. Especially because he was old and weak and his nerves were unstable, it was feared that he would not recover. His son received the telegram sent by the Donglai Bank in the morning and came to Shanghai on the noon train to take care of his father. It is said that although Zhu is nearly sixty years old, his parents are still alive and in their eighties.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Looks Like a Bandit Leader <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>▲Dong Shufang Mistakenly Reported to the Police</p>
<p>▲Realized It Was Not Him After Careful Examination</p>
<p>▲Both Were Released After Questioning and Judgment</p>
<p>In Ganyu County, Jiangbei, there is a man named Xu Dingxin, nicknamed "Fourth Master," who is a well-known local tyrant in the county. Although he is already in his sixties, his wild nature of bullying and oppressing the good and weak in the countryside has not changed slightly due to his age. He has many followers, and many nearby bandits are under his command, so his power is not weak. In the spring of the seventeenth year, the county government and the party department presented a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Department to offer a large reward for the arrest of Xu by all military and police agencies. In February of that year, Wang Guangsha, the director of the Overseas Public Security Bureau, purchased information and arrested Xu. Wang went to the provincial capital to request instructions on the procedure for sending him to the province for handling. Unexpectedly, Xu was very powerful and secretly sent a message to his gang after Wang entered the province, and they dared to gather a crowd to rob the prison and take Xu away. From then on, he disappeared, and Wang's success was almost punished. He then resigned. On July 23 of this year, a large number of bandits suddenly arrived in Yujiawan, Ganyu County, armed with complete equipment, led by Xu, and looted at will, killing and setting fire, doing everything evil. Dong Shufang's family in the area suffered a great loss. This was because Dong's uncle, Dong Xuepei, was a member of the Ganyu County Party Department in the spring of the seventeenth year. Xu believed that he was wanted by the government because of Dong Xuepei's denunciation, so he hated Dong to the bone. This time, he gathered bandits from all directions to harm Yujiawan, with the purpose of obtaining Dong Xuepei to avenge the old hatred. Therefore, the Dong family was devastated the most. Dong Shufang dared not live at home and fled to Shanghai to seek refuge. He recently received a home report saying that after Xu Dingxin looted Yujiawan with his gang and divided the spoils, he had fled to Shanghai because the local military and police were investigating strictly. Dong then paid special attention when going out, hoping to meet him, and then send him to the government for punishment, so as to eliminate the scourge of the people. At 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, Dong saw an old man on the road whose shape resembled Xu Dingxin. He followed him to Maijiaquan, Shandong Road. The old man entered the Huizhong Hotel there, and Dong followed him in. After inquiring, he learned that the old man was indeed a guest of Huizhong, living in room 58. Although the name of the guest on the nameplate was not Xu Dingxin, the origin and age were mostly the same. He thought that the bandit had deliberately changed his name. When he wanted to report to the police, he was troubled by his unfamiliarity, so he knew that Wang Guangsha was still in Shanghai, so he went to visit Wang, asking him to accompany him to the General Patrol House, reported the information, and asked the police to arrest him immediately. Western Detective Mei Sheng asked him again and again, and Dong insisted that the old man was indeed the notorious bandit Xu Dingxin, without any doubt. If the information was found to be false in the future, he was willing to accept the punishment. Detective Mei then went to room 58 of the Huizhong Hotel with Chinese detectives Wang Shunlin and Ma Wenda, and Dong and Wang. The old man was in the room, with a servant serving him. Detective Mei asked Dong again, and Dong still said that the old man was a notorious bandit. So the Chinese and Western detectives arrested the master and servant. Unexpectedly, Dong suddenly said that it was a mistake, because after careful examination of the old man's appearance, although it was roughly similar to the Xu bandit, there were still dissimilarities. Detective Mei heard Dong's words and thought that Dong had made a very hasty judgment. Since he had stated in advance that he would investigate the facts, he brought Dong and Wang, along with the old man and his servant, back to the police station. After questioning, he learned that the old man's name was Xu Maohan, a salt merchant from Haizhou, and he was sixty-two years old. His servant, Li Shun, was also from the same hometown. Only the surname and age of the old man were the same as the Xu bandit Dong had mentioned. Even more strange was that he also had the nickname "Fourth Master." Yang Huo's appearance was similar to Confucius, and it can be seen that the similarity of human appearances is true in both ancient and modern times. Yesterday morning, the police sent the four people to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Xu Bolong opened the court for interrogation. After the police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process, and that this matter was not an intentional false accusation, Dong was only caused by the banditry his family suffered, and Wang only accompanied Dong to the police station. It was proposed that no charges be filed against the two people's misunderstandings. Judge Xu then asked Dong and others one by one, and then ordered Xu Maoyun, Li Shun, Dong Shufang, and Wang Guangsha to be released, and also told Xu and Li that if they wanted to sue Dong, they could file a complaint themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Kidnapping of Huang Bohui <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>▲Sentencing Scheduled for Next Saturday</p>
<p>▲Witnesses Interrogated Again Yesterday</p>
<p>The kidnapping of Mr. Huang Bohui, the manager of the Shibao, was resolved when the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's water and land detectives rescued Mr. Huang on a bandit boat in western Shanghai within seven hours, and captured Zhou Wu and Li Wang, two people guarding the hostage, and seized a pistol. Because the incident occurred in the Public Concession, the Public Security Bureau extradited them to the Special District Local Court for interrogation. The details have been reported previously. The trial continued yesterday morning. The two pistols seized have also been handed over by the Public Security Bureau to the police station for investigation. Yu Bingfang, the boy who was sleeping in Mr. Huang's car at the time, testified that he was sleeping in the car that night to cool off, and he fell asleep. Later, the bandits drove the car to Singapore Road and then drove him off. The bandits hired a rickshaw to take him back to report the news, but he could not recognize the faces of the bandits. Zhou Jinx, a worker at the Shibao, testified that he was cooling off in the alley at the time when he heard the police whistle and ran out of the alley, knowing that the owner had been kidnapped. He chased after the car, but because he was unable to walk fast, it was difficult to catch up with the bandit car, and he could not recognize the faces of the bandits. Judge Xu then questioned the two defendants and appointed lawyer Yuan Hanyun to defend the defendants. After the debate ended, the court ordered the defendants to be returned to custody separately, and the sentencing was scheduled for Saturday morning.</p>

<p>The case of Sun Laowu, a native of Nantong in Quxia Bridge, Zhabei, being killed by his adopted son Sun Liansheng in collusion with Ji Shuangquan, Qiu Lansheng, and Qiu Shunlong, etc., has been prosecuted by the local court. Sun Liansheng has confessed to how he planned and killed, etc. However, Ji Shuangquan, Qiu Lansheng, etc. still do not admit it and have presented evidence to testify. For the sake of caution, Chief Judge Chen Bingrong of the Criminal Court continued the trial yesterday to seek more details. According to Wang Da, the witness of Ji Shuangquan, Ji Shuangquan was at his home for a bidding meeting around 7:00 PM on the second day of June. However, Qiu Lansheng claimed that he was eating snails at home at 7:30 PM on the second day of June and did not go to kill anyone. Later, after questioning his father, Qiu Changfu, he said that he had not eaten snails. Shao Songchun, who lived next door, was the person Qiu Lansheng named as having eaten snails with him, but Shao also denied eating snails, saying that he was already asleep at 7:00 PM and heard Zhang the carpenter go to Qiu Lansheng's house around 8:00 PM, and Qiu Lansheng was not yet asleep. The court then asked the plaintiff, Sun Fusheng, whether the clothes of Sun Liansheng and Qiu Shuntao when they were arrested were the same as now, and he replied yes. The court then carefully examined the clothes and found no blood stains. Therefore, the judge asked Sun Fusheng to invite the neighbor of the deceased to court to state the situation, and if he was unwilling to come to court, he should submit a written statement to be attached to the case. The case was postponed for debate, and the court ordered the defendants to be returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Wen Linsen's Suicide Note <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>▲Oppressed by Family Environment</p>
<p>▲Had No Choice But to Commit Suicide</p>
<p>Wen Linsen, a native of Shanghai living in the triangle area of Xujiahui, French Concession, was twenty-one years old this year. He lost his father at a young age. His father, Wen Dongsheng, ran a barber shop in Japan. After his father's death, his mother, Jiang, became familiar with Yao Yueting and supported the shop. Yao died last year. Linsen came of age and learned to be a water pipe fitter. Recently, due to disagreements between mother and son, they often quarreled. Linsen had a sudden idea and went out on the evening of the 4th to check into room 19 of the Gongshang Hotel at No. 313 Xinxiao Bridge Street, where he secretly swallowed raw opium and committed suicide. By noon the next day, the tea boy saw him sleeping and not getting up, called him but did not respond, pried open the door and went inside to check, and Wen had died of suffocation. The hotel reported to the Daximingzhong Police Station and ordered detectives to carry the body to the Tongren Fuyuantang autopsy for examination. A letter was found beside him. Yesterday morning, the Criminal Section of the French Police summoned the deceased's mother, Jiang, and aunt, Wen Shen, to the station and reported to Judge Zhu of the French Public Concession to examine the body. He sat in court, and the Bao Detective reported the situation. After Judge Zhu questioned the family of the deceased, he declared that the deceased Wen Linsen had committed suicide by taking poison before his death, and the deceased's mother, Yao Jiang, was allowed to prepare a coffin for burial herself. The suicide note is recorded below: Uncle, Aunt, Parents, Your nephew last told you about everything at home when I went to the Shen's house. Everything that mother said at my aunt's house after you came was completely untrue. I also came out to ask, asking my brother and sister for the money for food from childhood to adulthood. If I don't go out, mother will beat me and scold me to go out, scolding me day and night. The day before yesterday at eleven or twelve o'clock at night, mother was doing improper things outside the back door with someone and was seen by a bystander, who later told me. I also had no way to think. The day before yesterday, my aunt called me to go home, and I let him say. My aunt said to me that he had improper words. He said I would say. If I go home like this, mother said that my aunt sent him to promise to be fully responsible for everything in the family. He said that everything in the shop, including food and clothing, would be included, regardless of whether there was food or not. He asked me to clear up all the money owed in the shop before. Later, when Jiwen's daughter grew up, he would hire another man to take charge, and my brother and sister would give way, and he wouldn't care whether it was good or bad. I think it's not good now. My aunt called me to promise, but I don't want to. I think it's better for me to go to the road to hell if this continues every day. But please don't be sad. If there is a way to avenge me, let him go if there is no way. There is still my younger sister, you must be extra careful. Always look at the face of death and say it for me. I am now waiting at your house and it is difficult to explain. Please forgive me. I am now going to the road to hell to see you all. I can't write anymore, my heart hurts, I can't do it anymore. I'm gone, your nephew Linsen. The above is the general situation.</p>

<p>▲ Municipal Bureau of Public Works: Yesterday's Announcement</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Works issued an announcement yesterday stating: "Regarding the matter of announcements, according to the regulations governing vehicle licenses in this city, when a vehicle is taken out of service, the license plate should be returned to this bureau. Otherwise, the owner remains responsible for paying the fees. However, many vehicle owners neither return the license plates nor pay the fees on time. They then sell the vehicles to others, who reapply for licenses. The bureau regards the vehicle as the primary subject. It can only order the new owners to pay the back fees, which they are unwilling to do, as they are being held responsible for someone else's debt. Yet, the bureau must enforce the regulations and cannot make exceptions. To avoid such disputes, the following two points are announced for the attention of all buyers of used vehicles: (1) Buyers of used automobiles and other motorized vehicles should first submit the license plate and engine numbers to the General Vehicle Affairs Office of this bureau to inquire whether any fees are owed or other violations remain unresolved. (2) Buyers of used horse carriages, rickshaws, and large and small freight vehicles should check whether they have a steel-stamped number from this bureau. If there is a steel-stamped number, they should immediately inquire at the nearest Vehicle Affairs Office of this bureau whether any fees are owed or other violations remain unresolved."</p>

<p>▲ Ranked First Among All Seventeen Corps</p>
<p>The Chinese Corps of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps is the most prestigious team in the entire corps. It consistently trains diligently in various subjects and is therefore proficient in marksmanship. Self-discipline has been a characteristic of the corps in the past, and it is even more so now.

It is now reported that the corps recently received Corps Order No. 110 from the headquarters, announcing that the Chinese Corps has the highest overall score for the year, ranking first among all seventeen corps.

<p>▲ Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter Requesting Full Compensation</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, regarding the matter of the Japanese Dalian Steamship Company's ship "Chohei Maru" crushing the cargo barge of the Liyu Oil Firm, sent a letter to the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, forwarding a request for full compensation to the company. The original letter stated: "On the first day of this month, this chamber received a letter from the Chinese Grain, Oil, and Bean Cake Association, a member of this chamber, stating that the Liyu Oil Firm's cargo barge, managed by Mr. He Yinsheng, was loading bean cake at Pier 6 of the Huangpu Wharf on the afternoon of August 26th when it was crushed by the 'Chohei Maru' of the Japanese Dalian Steamship Company. The entire ship capsized, with 800 pieces of bean cake and four containers of bean oil on board. Except for the leakage of the bean oil, all the bean cake sank to the bottom of the Huangpu River, resulting in significant losses. In addition to reporting the incident to the Lujiazui Sub-Bureau of the Water Police and requesting an immediate investigation, we have also requested the River and Sea Customs Tonnage Office to record the incident. We are now writing to your chamber to uphold justice, forward the request to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, negotiate reasonably, and demand compensation to protect commercial interests." The letter included a detailed list of losses. "This chamber has received this communication and especially includes a list of losses. We respectfully request your chamber to consider the difficulties of businesses and provide assistance so that the losses can be compensated." The list of losses was enclosed with the communication. "The cargo barge of the Liyu Oil Firm was crushed by the 'Chohei Maru' of your country's Dalian Steamship Company at Pier 6 of the Huangpu Wharf, causing the entire ship to capsize and resulting in losses to the loaded bean oil cake. According to their estimates, the amount of losses reached 1,495.931 taels of customs silver. This loss to the oil firm should be fully compensated by the Dalian Steamship Company to ensure fairness. Based on the circumstances mentioned in the letter, we are sending the enclosed list to your office, requesting your assistance in forwarding it to the company for investigation and handling. This will truly strengthen our friendship."</p>

<h3 id="e182">No Suspicion of Inciting False Testimony <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>▲ Prosecutor Concludes Investigation and Declines to Prosecute</p>
<p>Lawyer Da Yaoxian, while defending Wang Desheng, who was reported by the Mixed Court Police for sending threatening letters, was accused by Wang Yaotang, the lawyer for the police, of attacking the police for using torture to extract confessions. He was accused of inciting Wang Desheng to deny the crime. Wang Desheng's case of being accused of sending threatening letters has already been defended by another lawyer, Ye Fangkang. On July 12th, the Special District Court acquitted Wang Desheng. As for Lawyer Da's part in inciting the retraction of testimony, it has already been submitted to the prosecutor for investigation, as noted in this newspaper. Afterwards, the police believed that since Wang Desheng was acquitted, the report against Lawyer Da should also not be valid. They prepared a letter requesting the court to stop the investigation or allow withdrawal. However, the prosecutor did not approve and continued the investigation according to law. The result was that Lawyer Da Yaoxian was deemed to have been exercising the duties of a lawyer and was not suspected of inciting false testimony. The prosecutor has sent the prepared decision not to prosecute to Lawyer Da for his receipt, and the case is closed.</p>

<p>▲ Conflicting Accounts from Both Parties</p>
<p>The Fourth District Public Security Bureau of Zhabei, yesterday, escorted a case of coercive rape from the Pengpu Township Security Corps, Second Team. Director Jin questioned the plaintiff, Gao Shuxian, a native of Taixing, residing at No. 2 Pingjiang Bridge, Zhonghua Xin Road, earning a living by working. He stated, "My wife, Wang, went out on the afternoon of the first day of this month around 3 PM to visit her younger sisters, hoping to find work in a silk factory. While walking along Pushen Road, she suddenly encountered the defendant, Yang Xiaosanzi, who falsely claimed to be her adoptive mother, calling her to come. My wife believed it to be true and followed him to the home of Chen Yang (i.e., Wang's adoptive mother, the elder sister of Xiaosanzi). Unexpectedly, Xiaosanzi suddenly closed the door. Yang helped drag my wife to the bed, tore off her clothes, and said, 'Don't make a sound. Sleep with me for a day. If you don't agree, I will put a gun to your head and kill you.' My wife was terrified upon hearing this. Fearing his ferocity, she dared not resist and allowed him to ravage her. The next day, she was taken to his own home and confined in a room, not allowed to cross the threshold. She was raped for four consecutive nights. My wife was mentally and physically exhausted and was about to fall ill. Fortunately, she managed to escape the other day and tearfully told me what had happened. I immediately arrested Yang and Chen Yang and reported them to the local Security Corps." According to Gao Wang, 20 years old, "Because of the difficulty of life, I went to ask my younger sisters to introduce me to work. Unexpectedly, Yang Xiaosanzi lured me into his home and threatened and raped me. My adoptive mother actually aided and abetted the abuse. I request a strict investigation." Questioned, Yang Xiaosanzi stated, "I am from Funing, 25 years old, and run a teahouse on Datong Road. I have always been law-abiding. The other day, the plaintiff's wife suddenly came to my place and knocked on my sister's door. I asked her what she wanted. Unexpectedly, she spoke disrespectfully. There was a verbal argument at the time. Unexpectedly, the Security Corps arrested me this morning, saying that I raped Wang. It is completely unjust." Yang stated, 41 years old, "The plaintiff's accusation is completely denied. I am Wang's adoptive mother and Xiaosanzi's sister. How could I do such a shameless thing? Please investigate." Director Jin, noting the conflicting testimonies, ordered that they be sent to the Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>▲ Wu Xiaoying's Tragic Love Affair</p>
<p>Wu Xiaoying, a girl from Wuxi, 18 years old, of fair appearance, initially worked as a fine yarn worker in the Seventh Factory of Shenxin in Yangshupu. She used her wages entirely for dressing up. Her clothing suggested that of a female student. Unfortunately, she was deceived, and was lured to the French Concession, where she was sold into the Yingxiang brothel. Xiaoying at this point, realizing that she was in a cage, was unwilling to engage in a life of prostitution. On the day before yesterday, she escaped and arrived near Tianbao Li, Zhabei, in search of her fellow countrymen. She was found by Inspector Guo Laitang of the Public Security Bureau and brought to a section of the Fourth District. After questioning, the details of what happened before was learned.

During a secret rendezvous, Qiao Shitang discovered them and reprimanded them, saying that he would report it to Abao's parents. As a result, Shen Axiao and Shen Abao tricked Qiao Shitang, got him drunk, and hit him with an iron bar, causing both legs to be crushed. The death was murder and the perpetrators deserted his corpse in the wilderness to conceal it. Consequently, prosecutor Yang summoned Shen Abao for interrogation, but she did not admit to the murder.

Yao then went to ask a Jiangbei doctor, Xu Guangyu, for medical treatment. Xu sent his apprentice, Ni Zhifu, to attend. However, Ni gave the woman two acupuncture injections in the palms of her hands, one in her upper lip, and then fumigated her nostrils and mouth with sandalwood. He did not allow her to leave, which obstructed her breathing and caused her to suffocate and die. Yao was greatly grieved and immediately brought Ni into custody of the water patrol. Yesterday, he was handed over to the local court, where prosecutor Wu examined and questioned the results, and ordered the defendant to be taken into custody pending further action.</p>

The officer arrested the men and interrogated them one by one, then sent them to the headquarters for questioning. It was later discovered that the house was rented by Xu Genrong, a Ningbo native who worked as a senior clerk at the Longmao Warehouse, residing at No. 7 in the same lane. Xu was taken to the district, where he claimed that the tenant, Xia Baosheng, was introduced by Tian Shen, a woman from Jiangbei. Since the household registration office had not been registered, the police also arrested Shen for interrogation. Considering Xu's old age and honesty, he was fined 15 dollars. Tian Shen was also deemed to be ignorant and deceived and was fined 5 dollars. Both were released leniently.</p>

The ship was backing up when the Weisheng warship, unable to avoid the sudden appearance of the Yunnan, had the Yunnan's stern violently collide with the iron barge alongside the warship's starboard side. The barge sustained minor damage, while the Yunnan's rudder was damaged and rendered useless, preventing it from traveling. As a result, it temporarily suspended departure, and the cargo and passengers on board had to be refunded or transferred to other ships. The ship returned to the wharf and must be docked for repairs.</p>

<p>Liu Junfu, a director of the Huajing Town in Shanghai County, sent vagrant Chen Xinlou to the Caohejing Vagrant Training Center in September of last year. The center released Chen Xinlou because he had a contagious disease. Chen Xinlou complained that Liu Junfu had solicited donations of 100 and 500 yuan. The Shanghai County Government arrested and sent Liu to the local court. Prosecutor Liu Pingfan questioned Liu Junfu, who firmly denied that he had solicited donations. The Vagrant Training Center had donation regulations specifying 500 or 100 yuan. Even if Liu Junfu had actually advised donating, it would not constitute any crime. Therefore, in accordance with Article 244, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law, he was given a decision not to prosecute.</p>

<p>Jin Su'e, a woman from Shanghai, intended to file a lawsuit due to a family matter. Gu Renze, who resided in the French Concession, impersonated a lawyer and persuaded the woman, claiming that he was a legal expert currently working as a lawyer. He promised that if she entrusted the lawsuit to him, she would surely win. The woman believed him to be true and repeatedly treated him to tea and meals. She was also gradually defrauded of a certain amount of money, but the lawsuit was delayed and did not proceed. The funds were exhausted. After being deceived, the woman sent a letter to the Shanghai Bar Association, requesting an investigation. After receiving the woman's letter, the Bar Association checked the lawyer's directory and found that there was no Gu Renze. It was clear that he was an impostor and engaged in deception. The Bar Association has sent a letter to the French Concession Police Station requesting a strict investigation and prosecution to maintain law and order.</p>

Detectives and Detective Feng Qi from the Hua Patrol team became suspicious, believing that they were smuggling contraband. They shouted for them to stop for inspection. The men ignored the orders. The detectives, fearing that they would escape, drew their guns and fired a shot. Their car finally stopped. The man in the blue cloth shirt and pants jumped out of the car and fled. The detectives were unable to catch him. They opened the packages and found them to be full of opium, weighing a total of 1,200 ounces. They arrested the two drivers and took them to the Hongkou station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Court. Judge Feng Shide interrogated them. Police attorney Gan Jingxian said that the two drivers were colluding with the drug dealers and should be severely punished. Chinese and Western detectives reported the circumstances of the investigation. Zhang and others stated that the car was rented by the man in the blue cloth shirt and pants, who said he was picking up guests at the wharf on Broadway Road. They claimed that they did not know that they were transporting drugs. Judge Feng ruled, based on the evidence, that Zhang and Chen should each be sentenced to one year in prison and fined 300 dollars. The opium was confiscated.</p>

<p>▲ Municipal Council to Discuss in Board Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Chinese employees of the Public Concession Municipal Council recently organized an association and requested the Municipal Council to recognize it. The matter was raised for discussion at the Wednesday board meeting. Since the Municipal Council had already recognized the Association of Western Employees, the case of the Chinese Employees' Association was the same. Therefore, the Board did not object to the Chinese employees forming an association, but the Chairman must compare the association's constitution with that of the Western Employees' Association. After reporting at the next Board meeting, a final decision on recognition will be made.</p>

<p>▲ The Tragic State of Burning, Looting, Killing, and Wounding</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provisional Relief Committee, at its 37th regular meeting on the 1st of this month, after hearing reports, received a telegram from Liu Shulun, the head of the committee's Suqian Relief Affairs, reporting on the banditry and flood situation in the county. The telegram stated: For several months, Suqian has been plagued by bandits. Since the beginning of summer, continuous rain has made the areas around Yanghe Bu and Gengche, ranging from several to nearly a hundred *li*, affected by disaster. Coupled with the bandits' trampling of farmers' homes, residents are trapped, gazing from their watchtowers. Fields are barren. On the 19th, Shulun went to Bu Zi Ji to distribute relief funds, passing through the west of the old Yellow River embankment, seeing a vast expanse of water and thorns, unable to distinguish crops. When distributing funds, he saw men, women, old, and young, all holding long poles, their faces dark, looking frightened. It was a pitiful sight. The situation is still like this now. How unbearable will it be as the year draws to a close? Other disaster-stricken areas are sending numerous people to the bureau to request investigation and rescue. Although he has politely declined out of necessity, how should he handle this situation? He investigated that in the fourth and fifth districts, apart from those who have already received aid, there are still over two hundred households. While he was in the process of providing supplementary aid, he suddenly heard on the 24th that bandits attacked Caiji and Yangji, burning and killing for over twenty *li*. Refugees fleeing to the city filled the roads, lacking food and shelter, a pitiful sight. He organized two temporary shelters to provide emergency relief. This morning (the 26th), County Magistrate Liu led a team to suppress the bandits. Shulun also accompanied relief friends to conduct an on-site investigation. They found over thirty villages and six hundred households burned, over ten people killed (excluding those looted), and over twenty people wounded. He is currently investigating and providing emergency relief and treating the wounded, etc.</p>

<p>▲ Commodity Inspection Bureau's Reply</p>
<p>Shanghai Museum Road No. 15, Hulink Company, engaged in foreign trade, with an agent in the United States to handle a portion of raw silk, recently sold one hundred *dan* of raw silk to the American merchant Scott in April of this year, with a signed contract and inspection certificate. However, the American merchant suddenly refused to acknowledge the contract and threatened to cancel other contracts. The company's manager, Wang Zhusu, petitioned the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting assistance to resolve the issue and avoid losses. The ministry ordered the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to cooperate with the Industry and Commerce Investigation Bureau to investigate the facts of the original case in detail and report back quickly for verification. Upon receiving the order, the bureau immediately cooperated with Zhang Pansun and Wang Jingxiu of the Industry and Commerce Investigation Bureau and went to Hulink Company for detailed investigation. Shao Yuanxi, director of the company's foreign business department, explained the details of the matter and reviewed all the documents in the case, which were found to be completely consistent with the report to the ministry. The detailed investigation, along with copies of the contract signed by both parties and other documents, has been submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for review.</p>

However, the family's coffin will be temporarily moved to the Shanghai Nanshi Yongxi Chang Shaoxing Guild Hall on the 12th. Because we did not want to trouble relatives and friends, we did not send out notices. Please correct this. We would be most grateful.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Buried Beneath Ancient Remains <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Wei</p>
<p>By Ying Ang</p>
<p>It seems that young people in general, when faced with the traces of past lives, invariably harbor disappointment or sorrow. Their hope is simply that the past be considered dead and buried at the gate of eternal life. Although they inevitably recall it endlessly, they feel the void filled by the imperfections experienced in the past, and plan for future changes. Now, young people’s attitude towards literature and art seems to be the same. Most young people cannot escape the oppression and constraints of the real environment. To comfort the hardships of these struggles and to imprint them, the only path worth pursuing is literature and art. Only through the expression of literary and artistic forms can one comfort and make up for that certain part of the defect. This is not a so-called opportunistic method. In such an era, only the nourishment of literature and art can satisfy the upward-striving will of young people's ideals. Besides this path, it can almost be said that there is no second path that can supply them, allowing them to immediately regain their original vitality after a period of fatigue and move towards the bright road ahead. This may not be a bad phenomenon.</p>
<p>However, some works by young people are certainly honest, but they often form the knot of the Chinese nation because of temporary complaints or momentary enthusiasm. Young people are naturally restless, and there are not a few who piece things together into articles. When I saw the table of contents of Mr. Ying Ang's book "Buried Beneath Ancient Remains," I suspected that the author's book might also have fallen into the morbid state I mentioned above, because the light sketch on the cover unintentionally symbolized it. Indeed, not unexpectedly, I found the author's own confession in the (Small Preface). He said, "Perhaps those images will never remain. If I didn't have a pen at the time, the materials that are now being thrown into the furnace would not be these. Even if some did come, they might not have been cast so clumsily. So, what is buried here are ancient remains." His attitude was simply that "once upon a time, I was moved to write, and unknowingly left traces of words. The traces of words unexpectedly pieced together into sentences. In some sentences, I couldn't help but reflect on the outlines of several stories." It is difficult to achieve good results writing novels with this attitude. I hope the author will strive to overcome it in the future.</p>
<p>This contains five short stories: ("Mr. Shi and His Story"), ("A Foreigner in China"), ("From Dusk to Twilight"), ("The Rise and Fall of Characters in Temple Lane"), and ("The Completion of Taste"). Among these, the depiction of Mr. Shi's story is the best.</p>
<p>("Mr. Shi and His Story") is about an interesting character. He is a local gentleman, a Chinese language teacher in a foreign school, and a correspondent for a Shanghai newspaper. Thus, Mr. Shi occupies a seemingly significant position in the local society, academic circles, and press. Relying on the power of the foreign school, he can ignore whether the news offends people, because in the midst of chaos, he can squat in the foreign school for a while and not go out. After a few days of leisure, everything will be fine. But the matter is really strange. The government suddenly arrested Mr. Shi, causing local people to rush to send telegrams to rescue him. As a result, this arrest turned into a gain for Mr. Shi. ("Perhaps this is a trick of both sides. The government had no choice but to arrest Mr. Shi and then use this release as a means of entanglement. Mr. Shi is a property clearance committee member, and the government suffers no loss, but the sufferers get many benefits.")</p>
<p>Mr. Shi is very aware of current affairs. Soon after the property clearance committee was established, disputes arose. The disputes arose because the committee members snatched Mr. Shi's business. But Mr. Shi is also open-minded. He thinks that there are still many places where he can make up for the loss and have plenty left over, so why bother with this. Secondly, his mind is not only not old-fashioned, but also very new. Although he is also a scholar, he approves of co-education and even threw inkstones at those antiques during meetings. He can speak "Yang Jingbang" dialect and calls his wife "a Miss Tian Tian in the past." He understands the students' tastes and knows their psychology ("Be as sloppy as you can"), but don't provoke his old gentleman's displeasure. In addition, Mr. Shi's experience as a reporter is also very thoughtful. Since learning the lesson of being arrested, the news released by Mr. Shi not only does not offend his superiors, but sometimes includes a few words of flattery, thus benefiting both sides. Why not do it? Moreover, thanks to his connection with the church, Mr. Shi has been able to remarry three times. So, in a word, Mr. Shi is smart.</p>
<p>However, the tide of revolution finally succeeded. In a sudden and drastic change, with the fluttering of the revolutionary army's flags, Mr. Shi also became one of the "Four King Kongs, Eighteen Arhats," and "Thirteen Taibaos, Five Little Ghosts" to be reformed in the local area. Fortunately, Mr. Shi escaped quickly at the time, so he was not reformed out of his life.</p>
<p>After about two hundred days of Mr. Shi's escape, he was still able to return to his hometown. However, it is said that he is no longer teaching or working as a reporter. The title of gentleman has been reformed away. It is thought that Mr. Shi is not doing that, but I wonder when Mr. Shi will be able to get another committee position to do. This is much more fashionable than before. (Page 28)</p>
<p>Then Mr. Shi will eventually have a day to regain his strength.</p>
<p>People like Mr. Shi, with minor differences, as far as I have seen personally, can be replaced by numbers. Especially in the situation of my hometown, in this sudden change of revolution, if I were to find characters similar to Mr. Shi, it would be a very easy thing. Sometimes, in the extreme of anger, I have tried my best to earnestly find these people, melt them into creation, and leave a trace for them, while promoting general reflection. But it has not been completed, which is truly regrettable. Now that I have read this article, it can be regarded as expressing the accumulation in my heart.</p>
<p>I also like ("The Completion of Taste") very much. It describes the psychology of a man with a wife who has not been well cared for, who wants to make life a little more comfortable and be able to work in peace, so he thinks of taking a concubine. The feeling is very powerful. Originally, in the whole book, the author's psychological descriptions are not many, and mostly only use actions to reflect the characters' psychological states, but here it turns to a deep psychological description.</p>
<p>(Entering the gate of spring, seeing the glittering and restless dark clouds, the hope before the dark clouds is that someone must be brought in to be a concubine. This is the crystallization of a lifetime of brewing. In my heart, I wish that the dark clouds are an unchangeable crystal product that can accompany me throughout my life.) (Page 110)</p>
<p>This completely exposes a person who is eagerly looking forward to the pursuit of happiness.</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>Secondly, I also like the old man in ("From Dusk to Twilight") very much. However, this old man is too purely Eastern. He only knows how to live plainly, from birth to death, without the "will to progress" and "desire to create." In this modern era where we want to express the spirit of our nation, it seems that such characters do not need to be expressed, because for us, living is not just living, but should be rich in the will to live, so that the life of the nation can be strong. If our lives are just mechanical and lifeless, what is the point?</p>
<p>Because the author uses the attitude of "piecing together sentences with traces of words" to write, each article has a kind of hasty state, that is, although the text is finished, there are still many things in the epilogue worth remembering. The author does not continue to write, so the structure cannot be complete, and there is also a suspicion of uneven writing. If he could write with an honest attitude, I don't think there would be such a result.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Founding Issue of Changfeng Monthly <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Bin</p>
<p>The fact has already clearly announced to us that advocating nationalistic literature and art is a matter that cannot be delayed at present. In the so-called "loose sand" of China, only this kind of literature and art that conforms to the trend of the times is the path for future research on literature and art, because it has a long historical background. Everyone knows that China has a culture that is five thousand years ahead of the world, and in the past, it made many contributions to the academic circles of the world. Even the earliest and most reliable collection of poetry, the Book of Songs, was aware of extremely profound nationalistic thought at that time. This is generally recognized by scholars. Therefore, advocating nationalistic literature and art in the current China, where the ideological circles are chaotic and decadent, has a very broad significance. Everyone should joyfully and enthusiastically sing its rise. Therefore, since the publication of the most powerful (Avant-Garde Weekly) in promoting nationalistic literature and art, the literary world in the country has been greatly revitalized. There is a rapid development in academic progress and the rise of publications. Taking Shanghai, the cultural center, as an example, there have been many that have risen or have had an impact on them, such as (Era Youth), which guides students in logical reasoning, and (Caoye Weekly), which focuses on creative news and is quick. All of these take nationalism as the center of their efforts in literature and art. In other places, there are also many publications about this kind of literature and art being produced, especially in our capital, which has a new atmosphere. This shines with infinitely bright and brilliant hope for the future of China's academic circles, which are becoming increasingly backward. The revival of Chinese culture, shining a unique light on the world's literary scene, can be predicted with certainty that this will happen in the near future.</p>
<p>The (Changfeng Monthly) that I am now going to introduce to readers who love literature and art is one of the publications that has recently appeared in the publishing world of the capital.</p>
<p>In the Chinese publishing world, where ideological confusion is unbearable, many scholars who specialize in literature and art urgently need to clean it up. It is really not right to allow it to remain chaotic for a long time. Therefore, the large and small publications currently published all grasp a consistent central idea in essence, and very clearly and thoroughly promote to readers what they advocate and believe in, and draw a clear line of their own battle lines. This is the initial step to clear up the unbearable ideological confusion. Therefore, this Changfeng Monthly, which takes "introducing world scholarship and promoting national spirit as its purpose," also takes on its mission in literature and art, and clearly expresses itself to us at the beginning. At the same time, it also discusses politics, but culture and politics have a close connection and cannot be separated. This is a fact.</p>
<p>The cultural history of mankind for thousands of years is the product of thought. The new inventions and new sciences of the twentieth century are also all products of thought. The division between humans and other animals is that the former has a larger scope of intellectual activity, while the latter has a smaller scope of intellectual activity. The rise and fall of nations, the superiority and inferiority of culture, and the excellence or inferiority of politics are all determined by people's thoughts. Hegel (Heael) said, "The authority of thought is fiercer than the raging fire of hell." Is that a lie?</p>
<p>These are indeed sharp words. Originally, "animals have intelligence, but not as great as human intelligence." If we want the country to be strong, we must start by working hard on the national literature of the country to which we belong. Therefore, promoting the national literature and art movement cannot be delayed any longer, because we really need to know the two great missions that this (Changfeng Monthly) sincerely undertakes.</p>
<p>We have seen the unbearable confusion and decadence of the Chinese ideological circles, and we also know that only from the academic standpoint can we sort out the confused and decadent thoughts. Therefore, we have to devote ourselves to the movement of sorting out thoughts. The motive for publishing this publication is conceived here. This publication has two major missions: one is to introduce world scholarship, and the other is to promote national spirit. China is not only backward in industry, but also in scholarship. The danger of academic famine is greater than the danger of material famine. If others' scholarship advances rapidly, and we do not catch up, we will not only always fall behind, but we will also not be able to survive, because the competition for survival is becoming increasingly fierce. The weapon of competition is scholarship. Those with scholarship live, those without scholarship die. Those whose scholarship progresses win, those whose scholarship is naive lose. Why can't we resist the imperialist aggression in China for eighty years, and let them slaughter us? Isn't it because their scholarship is stronger than ours? Otherwise, since we are all human beings, why do they have organization, planning, and can use scientific methods in everything, while we cannot? If the Chinese do not work hard to become strong, if we want to get rid of the mark of a semi-colony and wash away the great shame of the past eighty years, there is no other way but to strive for academic development.</p>
<p>We are the Chinese nation, and of course we should not forget Chinese culture, let alone sit idly by and watch Chinese culture fall into a state of never reviving. At the same time, we must sacrifice some precious brainpower and find out the cause and effect of why Chinese culture, despite having more than 5,000 years of history, cannot leap to the forefront of the world. Regarding this, the paragraph quoted above explains it to us thoroughly and without omission. It also seems like needle pricks, and every word touches the hearts of Chinese scholars and young people who love literature and art, arousing the heart to strive hard to promote Chinese national literature. But we must know that we have now reached an era of (hanging by a thread). It is like a blazing torch burning behind us, and the people in front have to bravely rise up their spirits and rush forward. Do you still hesitate to move forward? Then, you will not only not be able to stand still, but you will also be in danger of losing your life.</p>
<p>Secondly, the publication has a more detailed explanation of the two missions it undertakes. Due to the limitations of the publication's space, we can only abandon the introduction of world scholarship, and only quote the second mission it wants to accomplish. But the points it discusses are very precise and thorough. For those of us who love literature and art, we have no choice but to read it with pleasure, because it has many places that can be used as a reference for those who strive for national literature and art. I hope readers will read it with a calm mind. It is developing so powerfully:</p>
<p>The second mission of this publication is to promote the national spirit. Nationalism is certainly not enough to be a lesson, but the national spirit must be promoted with all our strength. Everyone knows that the nation is different from the country, and there is no need to explain it. The Chinese nation has shown a special brilliance in history. The contribution of the Chinese nation to human culture has been recognized by scholars all over the world. However, since the Opium War, the Chinese nation has gradually fallen into the position of a semi-colony, and there is a tendency to be in danger of perishing from morning till evening. Why is it so weak? There are at least half a dozen reasons for its weakness, but the biggest reason is the loss of national spirit. This point is explained in detail by the President in the Three Principles of the People. The national spirit is the marrow of the national culture. If the national spirit cannot be promoted, the national culture will inevitably wither. ... Gandhi's sacrifice for the Indian nation, Kemal's contribution to the Turkish nation, and the independence movements of the Korean, Annamese, Filipino, and Persian nations are all manifestations of the development of national consciousness. This kind of movement is the cry of various nations for freedom and equality, and it is the expression of all mankind seeking light and realizing justice. If things are not fair, they will cry out. If the gap between the oppressed and the oppressors cannot be bridged between nations, mankind will never have a day of security. It can be seen that the efforts of various nations to seek solutions are indeed self-help and helping others, because the spirit of nationalism and the spirit of internationalism are originally the same. Nationalism is the foundation of internationalism. Only nationalism is the enemy of internationalism. Therefore, promoting the national spirit is not only a means for a nation to liberate itself, but also a harbinger of the great unity of mankind.</p>
<p>We have a clear understanding of the purpose of the publication and the tasks that should be completed. Now, we need to examine its contents. However, the unity of thought and grasping the central consciousness of the nation is inevitable and does not need to be repeated. It is divided into (Special Discussion) and (Literature and Art) columns. The former contains six great works, and the latter contains eight chapters of poetry, scholarship, and novels. Equal emphasis is placed on translation and creation, which is in line with the two great missions that the publication undertakes. In the (Special Discussion) column, there are also discussions about science, education, and youth issues. These are all precise and great works, which greatly benefit our readers. Finally, there are three miscellaneous essays attached, which also have a rather sharp flavor.</p>

<p>(1) The British airship R-100 departed from Cardington on July 29th and arrived safely at St. Hubert Station in Montreal, Canada on August 1st. The long journey of more than 3,000 miles took only 78 hours and 51 minutes.</p>
<p>The composition of the so-called (British Empire) relies entirely on transportation. In the past, warships were practical tools for national defense equipment and liaison, but now aircraft are also used and promoted without reservation. Last year, the British had already established two major air routes between London, Berlin, Moscow, and London, Cairo, and Karachi. This year, Ms. Gong Sheng broke the previous record for long-distance flights between England and Australia in three weeks. Recently, the R-100 airship completed the long-distance flight between England and Canada across the Atlantic in 79 hours. This not only opened a new era in transportation, but also strengthened the close relationship between the British Empire and its colonies. The significance of this is something we cannot ignore.</p>
