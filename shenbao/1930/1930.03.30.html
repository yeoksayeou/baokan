<p>時評</p>
<h3>德法政潮與楊格計劃</h3>
<p>近來德法兩國因財政而引起之政潮。探其原。皆與解决大戰後賠欵問題之楊格計劃有關。德議會在通過楊格計劃時。發生劇烈之爭執。今之各黨派對整理財政案之相持。其端皆由斯而啓也。法議會今日之紛擾。則因左右兩翼議員。請展緩批准楊格計劃之故。由是可知十年前大戰所留遺之賠欵問題。今日尚影響於勝負兩方之政潮。嗚呼。戰之爲禍烈矣。</p>
<p>世界極慘酷之大戰告終後。以賠欵問題難决。組織賠欵委員會。德以該會所定之數。無力負担而堅拒。於是協約國復興兵進駐魯爾。大起紛擾。復於巴黎柏林兩地迭開會議。經協約方面讓步。乃成立所謂道威斯計劃。迨倫敦會議簽字後。該問題復起爭執。再召集專家會議於巴黎。始成立所謂楊格計劃之協定。此計劃較道威斯計劃。協約方面。又略讓步。兩方均表同意。宜乎可以無問題矣。然而爲實現此計劃之會議。地點上又起爭執。最後於去年八月開賠欵會議於海牙。以解决此項賠欵之分配方法。其間協約方面。又以利害意見之不同。幾乎復起破裂。幸其後竭力調停。互相諒解。德賠欵問題。至是始獲完全解决。駐兵亦始開拔撤退。吾述以上過去之歷史。以見此楊格計劃。在成立以前。經過極大之糾紛困難。在成立以後。又經過極大之風雲危險。費若干次之專家與代表會議。無數次之口舌與文字爭辨。乃有此各方同意之效果。可謂極千辛萬苦而成者矣。不意今日僅留此通過批准之一問題德法議會。猶有一部分表示不滿而引起閣潮者。雖其中未必無借題以攻擊政府之人。然究其原因。亦未始非大戰所留遺之影響。吾於是益歎和平實現之不可緩矣。</p>

<p>札礦經戰損失、約略計之、當在二百餘萬金盧布、（每金盧布折合我國國幣一元五六角不等）計機務處所有機器、悉被拆去、房屋被砲火擊燬、大小賬房、均付一炬、消防倉庫所有物品、赤軍全數運走、電燈廠機器、亦多半運走、九號煤洞鍋爐、弔煤機器房、並機器等物、悉被炸壞、弔煤大架、完全被燒、洞内水磅、下沙井口、下木洞口、新洞口、以及道北新修各處官房及兵房等、全被焚燒、此外俱樂部房炸毀兩間、總庫房之物品、板子廠之木料、礦區内之鐵道電杆電綫及礦内存欵　舖墊傢俱、均被赤軍席捲一空、升降機被炸壞、電話機則燒燬、馬匹汽車馬車、亦均被運去、總之、礦區内所有動產、均被赤軍捆載而歸、其不動產損失、更隨在皆是、此次變故、受創過深、恢復舊觀、實大費經營矣、</p>
<p>當赤軍佔領札蘭諾爾、并大事破壞礦區後、即在該處設立政治探訪局、搜查白黨、及反對蘇聯人員、札礦入籍白俄及華職工二百餘人、均不知下落、或被逮捕解俄、或已逃往他處、其紅黨職工、有表示甘願隨同赤軍回國者、似此非俟俘虜完全放回後、殊難明晰、再札礦被赤軍破壞、停止工作以後、地方燃料、極感缺乏、赤軍曾自行僱派工人、開採明洞煤觔、前後計運走百五十車之多、斯又札礦之顯然一大損失也、</p>
<p>札礦礦區廣大、產額甚富、東北各地燃料、多利賴之、故應力行設法恢復、一以鞏固中東鐵路之經濟、一以安揷大批失業工人、茲聞東鐵路局華局長郭崇熙、已飭令材料處擬具恢復計劃、並正事籌商具體辦法、大略如下、</p>
<p>按札礦係於去年十一月十六日、因受戰爭影響而停工、依照一九二九年度採煤計劃書、去年已採出者爲一七四·○○○公噸、未及採者二六·○○○公噸、九號洞尚有未採之煤、約一·○○○·○○○公噸、但九號煤洞、全部被赤軍破壞、故頗費經營、不過根據東鐵路局一九二九年三月七日路局會議議决、應於一九三二年（即後年　完全停止九號煤洞之工作）</p>
<p>、專事擴充明煤溝、以免發生頽陷危險、如此則九號煤洞暫時勢無恢復可能、礦區明煤溝、產煤之區甚夥、現有及備採之煤、計有（一）新煤礦有現煤計六○·○○○公噸（能供東鐵全路三年之用）（二）新煤溝區内預採之煤、計二·○○○·○○○公噸、能供東鐵全路十年之用）（三）第一號產煤區、深約四十公尺、能出煤三○·○○○·○○○公噸、（能供東鐵全路百五十年之用）又該處平面度深約二三公尺、能出煤五·○○○·○○○公噸、（能供東鐵全路二十五年之用）至東鐵全路每年需煤數目、計爲二二○·○○○公噸、恢復計劃、應先解决者有兩要點、（甲）應决定九號洞是否繼續工作、（乙）新煤溝内、在本年能出煤六○·○○○公噸、明年能出煤二二○·○○○公噸、後年能出煤二二○·○○○公噸、須於最短期内着手進行、如此則本年九月問每日能採煤二十車、十月間每日能採二十五車、十一十二兩月間每日能採三十車、如本年欲恢復煤礦工作、則須暫撥以下之各種用欵、（一）新煤溝設置抽水機一架、中央分水機兩架、電滾兩架、電機兩架、及修理房舍費、約須四·四八九·五一三金魯布、（二）修理機務廠、及設置　床機件、及應用工具、約須四·○九四·○四五金魯布、（三）電燈廠之設備、應購發電機兩架、電滾三具、並修理電機廠之房舍、約費二六·六四六·○七七金魯布、（四）置備消防器具、約須二九○·五五○金魯布、（五）設置馬栅、及購舖墊費、約須二○七·五○○金魯布、（六）修理浴塘約須二五○·○○○金魯布（七）清理毀餘之舊機件、計重五○○公噸、約須一·○○○·○○○金魯布、（八）職工補充費、約須五·○○○金魯布、（九）修理公用房舍、約須三九·○○○金魯布、（十）舖設產煤區之道綫、計長十公里、約須七○·○○○金魯布、（十一）探採礦綫區費、約須三○·○○○金魯布、（十二）修理各種公用物品及工具、測量器具、技術圖書室、以及測繪之材料、約須一六·五五○金魯布、（十三）設置電話承轉機、及三十號電話總綫、約須三四八·二○○金魯布、統計以上各項、約共須五三·三八○·八八五金魯布、</p>
<p>東路華局長郭崇熙、對札礦之恢復、决意於最短期間内、見諸實行、至對於上述之恢復計劃、擬再一度諮詢專家後、即行提出東鐵路局會議、商决一切、不過吾人試一迴想、去年中俄之役、沿邊各地、被赤軍刦掠之損失、直難以數計、即僅就札礦而言、竟達二百餘萬、今年籌謀恢復、又須如此鉅欵、而此鉅欵之出路、又不外取於中東鐵路、換言之、仍再添東北人民之負担耳、（三月十九日）</p>

<h3>樂華與西捕劇戰成和局</h3>
<p>比數爲三對三······延長卅分卒無勝負</p>
<p>史高塔杯複賽······將來再要一决雌雄</p>
<p>本届上海西人足球總會之四種杯賽、除萬國杯被中國奪得外、餘如甲組錦標、高級杯等、均被威脫希·活塞司先後得去、僅餘史谷塔杯、樂華隊當有奪取之希望、昨日下午三時、樂華與西捕在中華棒球塲複賽、勝負可暗示錦標之誰得、劇塲結果、各獲三球、勝負未分、乃延長三十分鐘、决最後雌雄、結果又各無所得、仍爲和局而散、乃改日再賽、茲記其情形如下、</p>
<p>（一）西捕陣綫較前佳</p>
<p>昨日樂華隊有華南著名左翼陳光耀加入作戰、事前之意料、以爲樂華可操必勝、詎料西捕昨日之陣線、大形調動、如中堅軋許後衛透納、均調任前鋒、後方實力、確並不减色、反見其内外鞏固、戰力充實、樂華陳光耀之左翼、奔跑迅速、傳送得法、不可多得、惟下半時起、因脚傷未能盡量發展、爲可惜耳、如戴麟經陳虞添、奚巧生等、俱少精彩、李惠堂亦不過爾爾、中衛線除孫思敬外、餘子平平、後衛江善敬胆量過人、截球極有把握、可謂異軍突起之後衛良才、</p>
<p>（二）開賽未久西捕獲球</p>
<p>開賽未久、西捕先攻入樂華一球、而後樂華亡命反攻、亦獲一球、接連再勝一球、此球最有精彩、雙方接戰劇烈、形勢緊急、樂華五前鋒將西捕球門四面包圍、故西捕始終未能將球踢出、卒被樂華奚巧生中的而回、博得采聲不少、下半時西捕先進一球、造成各二、未幾、樂華又以三比二佔先、嗣後西捕猛力進攻、周賢言因跑出救球、門内空虛、江善敬乃退守門中、不料一球飛來、　江無法阻攔、抵有用手接之、遂被罰十二碼、被西捕德飛踢入、成三與三之和局、　雙方表演殊佳、勝負猶其餘事、</p>
<p>（三）樂華健將屢失良機</p>
<p>列陣交鋒、西捕撥球向樂華進攻、來勢兇兇、樂華各方防禦、陳光耀退回助戰、李寗將球截住踢出、李惠堂與陳光耀二軍齊發、陳接惠堂之球、單槍匹馬、深入敵陣、至相當地點、傳向西捕門前、戴麟經射門太高、機會失去、周旋未久、樂華從右路進兵、陳虞添關破而進、至西捕門邊、將球傳至左方、陳光耀趕上打門、球向右方出界、繼之奚巧生亦失去極好機會、誠樂華之不幸也、</p>
<p>（四）西捕一球頭頂攻入</p>
<p>西捕屢遭風波、而能苟安過去、精神不覺爲之大振　乃率師追殺　浩浩蕩蕩、樂華驚惶失措、全軍退守、惟西捕前鋒軋許與透納、來得兇猛、連絡五路先鋒、夾攻樂門、樂華陷於四面楚歌之中、右内鋒達維爾見軋許挑起高球　乃用頭頂攻門、周賢言躍起阻擋未及、球落門内、樂華遂負一球、相戰未及十分鐘耳、</p>
<p>（五）西捕球勢益見順利</p>
<p>西捕球勢、益見順利、樂華門前、險象不脫、幸保守得法、未致失利、乃領陰入寇、陳虞添送球至西捕門前、李惠堂截得、因地位不佳、再傳與陳光耀、陳舉脚射門、球急且準、西捕守門勃拉特手脚敏捷　將球托出後方、洵見功夫　衆口讚美陳光耀繼踢角球　落點雖佳、卒被救出、</p>
<p>（六）樂華報復西捕告危</p>
<p>餘人、除童子軍服務外、更參加來賓表演、有團體操、土風舞等節目、運動會籌備處、曾來函排在四月七日舉行、亦表示歡迎熱忱該校學生陳新元　係全市選手之一、同時亦赴杭參加大會比賽、陳女士市會比賽錦標、於昨已蒙會内頒到、計市黨部執行委員會、大銀盾一座、租界臨時法院、緞旗一面云、</p>

<p>列陣交鋒、西捕撥球向樂華進攻、來勢兇兇、樂華各方防禦、陳光耀退回助戰、李寗將球截住踢出、李惠堂與陳光耀二軍齊發、陳接惠堂之球、單槍匹馬、深入敵陣、至相當地點、傳向西捕門前、戴麟經射門太高、機會失去、周旋未久、樂華從右路進兵、陳虞添關破而進、至西捕門邊、將球傳至左方、陳光耀趕上打門、球向右方出界、繼之奚巧生亦失去極好機會、誠樂華之不幸也、</p>
<p>（四）西捕一球頭頂攻入</p>
<p>西捕屢遭風波、而能苟安過去、精神不覺爲之大振　乃率師追殺　浩浩蕩蕩、樂華驚惶失措、全軍退守、惟西捕前鋒軋許與透納、來得兇猛、連絡五路先鋒、夾攻樂門、樂華陷於四面楚歌之中、右内鋒達維爾見軋許挑起高球、乃用頭頂攻門、周賢言躍起阻擋未及、球落門内、樂華遂負一球、相戰未及十分鐘耳、</p>
<p>（五）西捕球勢益見順利</p>
<p>西捕球勢、益見順利、樂華門前、險象不脫、幸保守得法、未致失利、乃領陰入寇、陳虞添送球至西捕門前、李惠堂截得、因地位不佳、再傳與陳光耀、陳舉脚射門、球急且準、西捕守門勃拉特手脚敏捷　將球托出後方、洵見功夫　衆口讚美陳光耀繼踢角球　落點雖佳、卒被救出、</p>
<p>（六）樂華報復西捕告危</p>
<p>餘人、除童子軍服務外、更參加來賓表演、有團體操、土風舞等節目、運動會籌備處、曾來函排在四月七日舉行、亦表示歡迎熱忱該校學生陳新元　係全市選手之一、同時亦赴杭參加大會比賽、陳女士市會比賽錦標、於昨已蒙會内頒到、計市黨部執行委員會、大銀盾一座、租界臨時法院、緞旗一面云、</p>

<p>（七）李奚各一球建奇功</p>
<p>樂華亡命進攻　力謀取勝　苦戰良久、卒由李惠堂攻入一球、此球得力於陳光耀、於是軍容大振　聲勢煊赫、惠堂與光耀二將、短兵相接、帶球前進、李在左角傳中、球掠西捕球門、直趨右方、陳虞添猛力打門、球復掠門向左、西捕見勢不佳　吃緊守衛　樂華前鋒、包圍西捕球門、猛力施射、你一脚　我一脚、西捕則左攔右擋、但聞球聲砰砰、無異置身戰塲、在此混戰聲中、忽聞歡呼之聲、如春雷暴、奚巧生建立奇功矣、樂華反以二比零超勝、終了上半時、</p>
<p>（八）西捕又一球成平手</p>
<p>再戰聲起　西捕取先聲奪人之志、宛如餓虎撲食、勇猛非凡、樂華門前、遍地皆碧眼黄毛、球聲如連珠砲響　連續射擊、周賢言身處砲火之中、招架爲難　幸有江善敬·孫思敬·李寗等、把守得法、化險爲夷、惟西捕兵力充足、一陣方退、一陣又起、樂華區内、危險不脫、搏戰多時　卒被左内鋒透納射中一球、造成二與二之平手、</p>
<p>（九）樂華不幸罰十二碼</p>
<p>中央開球　樂華直搗黄龍、陳光耀用高球送球塲中、李惠堂衝前截得、單騎進攻、深入敵陣西捕後衛活根生追隨李後　意圖阻攔、將達門前、李惠堂一個翻身、球已離脚　飛入西捕門内、樂華遂又以三比二居勝矣　但天有不測風雲、人有旦夕禍福　榮華方告凱旋、西捕追踪而至、中鋒軋許、帶球衝上　周賢言跑出、意欲解危、詎料時間不當、江善敬見門内空虛、即坐守門中、忽而碰然一聲　軋許已射球入門、江見勢不妙、然無法救脫、不得已祇有用手接之、乃被罰十二碼球、被西捕中堅德飛踢入、又成三比三之平手矣、</p>
<p>（十）延長三十分卒無勝負</p>
<p>此後互相角逐、各無建樹、時聞告終、勝負未分、乃延長三十分鐘、决最後之勝負、又各無所獲、和局而終　史高塔杯之决賽權、當無眉目、容後再看好身手</p>

<p>主席報告　主席陳德徵致開會詞云、各界代表、各位同志、十九年前今日下午一時、是埋葬在黄花崗的七十二位烈士、開始爲國殉難的工作的時候、原來那一次的殉難的壯烈光榮的事實之來原、是如此的、在一九一一年、廣州新軍失敗了、總理失掉他忠實的信徒很多、而革命的工作却愈益的急進起來、許多的同志、各省革命黨的精英、都集合在廣州、那時的計劃、是預備克復廣州之後、由黄克强同志率領一枝人馬、由廣州出發、直向湖南進攻、另一路由其他同志集合、向江西進發、大家會師中原、因爲那時的情景、是一定要克復廣州之後、革命的勢力、在後方有鞏固的根據、才可向中原進發、才可進佔南京、才可進窺中原、才可掃盪北方愛新覺羅氏的巢穴、所以這廣州一城、就成爲我們的目的地、這個計劃、是由總理决定的、其重要機關在香港設了三個、積極的進行起來、南洋羣島的華僑、受了總理的號召　給予許多精力、來帮助革命、因之聲勢浩蕩、那時昏瞶糊塗的滿清政府、驚醒了睡夢、深知這個革命力量的發動、是已箭在弦上、深知這個力量、要是暴發起來了、是不能抗敵的、於是就指揮他的臣奴、加緊的壓迫、直到了三月二十五號、不知有多多少少、預備舉義的準備·舉義的計劃·舉義的機關·遭受了許多的壓迫、在那時候、各位革命的志士、在忍無可忍的狀態中、便不能不迅速起來幹了、因爲要想大家是再延遲下去、等了那班滿清臣奴防範得更久的時候、克復廣州、一定是更難了、同時我們的烈士們、又得到在廣州和防營聯絡好了的消息、因此、在十九年前的今日、才决定開始了這一次轟動全世界驚絶滿清政府的轟轟烈烈光明爍爛的起義舉動、不幸中間爲了衆寡懸殊、和滿清在廣州設置壓迫的力量大大的緣故、結果、是慘敗了、這次慘敗了的結果、在同志方面、有的是逃亡了、有的是被捕了、有的是殉難了、綜計因是役而犧牲的、有七十二位志士、而逃亡了的同志、終於能繼續奮鬥、驅除　虜、把革命的事業、和這次的光榮保存着、一直到現在、那些犧牲了的同志呢、他們的尸首、直到四月五日、才有一位同志、把他們叢葬在黄花岡上、就是現在兀立廣州市外、受萬世憑弔而崇拜的黄花岡七十二烈士之墓、因爲這次悲壯的三二九事件、不但引起了全國革命民衆之熱血騰沸、且引起了全世界同情於總理領導革命的奮鬥之重大注意、到同年十月十日武昌就起義了、於是打倒愛新覺羅氏的二百六十餘年專制的統治、而奪還了我們中華整個民族的自由、這一段悲壯熱烈光榮的歴史、永遠值得我們憑弔、來紀念來崇拜、永遠使我們的情緒興奮着、永遠使我們的熱血沸騰着、現在處此全國不安定的時候、全國風氣漸漸往最低層墮落下去的時候、我們來重聽七十二烈士殉國的慘史、重念七十二烈士未竟之遺志、和遺留的敎言、我們不但要哀痛、併且還要悲憤啊、我們深深地認識七十二烈士所以能成此偉大犧牲的必要條件、有三點、可以提出來的、第一點、黄花岡七十二烈士有一個中心的信仰、我們的中心信仰是什麽、就是大家都毫無疑義的相信三民主義、的確是救中國唯一途徑、總理的確是革命的導師、總理所創導的革命是一定會實現成功的、由於這種堅强的信仰、發生這一個偉大的力量、造成這千古景仰的光榮燦爛的三二九事件、第二點、黄花岡七十二烈士、不是個個三頭六臂的、都和我們一樣的、有二十餘歲三十餘歲的青年、有四十餘歲的壯年、他們之所以異於常人者、在能保持天地間的正氣、個個人有廉恥心、個個人尊重氣節、憑着這天地間正氣與夫氣節廉恥、爲民族犧牲、爲民族拚命、結果、使滿清政府喪破了膽、使全世界凡同情於革命的、都大家嚴密的注意、第三點、黄花崗烈士、有刀鋸斧鉞加諸其身而無所畏懼的勇敢、有爲公犧牲無所顧惜的决心、這種精神、喚起了全國民衆之革命的情緒、促成了武昌起義、就是我們今日也還沽受他們的恩惠不少、黄花崗七十二烈士具備了這幾種偉大精神、自然什麽事都可辦了、回想當時諸烈士的意思、是要想先把滿清政府打倒、然後去抵禦外寇、然後去打倒一切帝國主義、他們這種偉大的志願、眞是使我們至於今還是傾佩不止的、他們有了這樣的偉大志願、具備了這樣的偉大精神、雖不能親自看見滿清政府之滅亡、但終究能於最短期間内、實現了辛亥革命之成功、以慰七十二烈士在天之靈、我們聽到七十二烈士的殉國慘史、想到現在末路軍閥的禍國殃民、和無恥文氓的日趨沉淪、使我們在悲痛之餘、不得不提起幾點意思來自勉勉人、第一點我們要自勉的、就是我們個個人都先該具備着如七十二烈士所具有的一個中心信仰、我們的中心信仰、誰都曉得、就是總理遺敎、我們要把總理遺敎做我們行事的規範、努力的目標　并且要擴展開來、使全國民衆、都能這樣做、要是誰來作踐總理遺敎　誰來破壞這個中心信仰、就是我們的大敵　這個作踐總理遺敎、破壞中心信仰的大敵、我們就得起來撲滅他、我們深信、我們奉行總理遺敎、是今日唯一的中心信仰、我們一刻都不能離開這中心信仰、第二點、七十二烈士所保持的正氣和氣節廉恥　實在非常重要、實在值得寳貴、我要使天地間正氣永遠生存着、我們要永遠發揚光大七十二烈士悲壯光榮的義舉、我們知道、現在有許多人、自已没有權利、供他作威作福、就來攻擊政府、自已没有充洩私慾的機會、就來攻擊政府、這種喪失人格、蔑棄正氣的無恥敗類、我們是要消滅他們的　我們深信　要是讓這些無恥者的生命延長下去、我們的民族國家、一定會跟着朝鮮印度安南等走同樣的命運的、我們要保存民族生存國家生命、我們唯有用我們全力來保留來發揚這天地間之正氣、我們要以民族的光榮爲光榮、我們不要以個人的私慾而破壞民族的光榮、我們並且要打倒那些爲個人私慾而破壞民族光榮的恥敗類、第三點、我們要有黽勉從公的犧牲精神、個人的一切都不成問題　個人的生活·財力·生命·知慧等等、都要爲國家爲民族爲人類用、我們要具有公而忘私的犧牲精神　這種精神、黄花崗七十二烈士、早已用三二九事實、具體地表現出來、給我們做榜樣了、我們應該繼續他們的精神、爲民族爭自由、現在有許多反動份子、都在爲私利而搗亂、我們必須鼓着我們的勇氣、拚着我們公而忘私的犧牲精神、來撲滅他們、我們只有繼續七十二烈士的精神、向一切破壞國家和平統一、並且不顧民族存亡的搗亂者肉搏　第四點　我們要有七十二烈士所具有的偉大志願、現在中國、有奸亂性成的軍閥、有思想落伍的文氓、有酷愛搗亂的政客、除此以外、還有封建思想、和帝國主義形成的猖獗勢力、這些都是危害國民革命的蟊賊大敵、總理在時、我們可以跟着總理跑、聽着總理的指導來幹、現在總理死了、我們唯有依照了總理遺敎、集中在中國國民黨旗幟之下、受黨的領導、來完成七十二烈士所未完成的偉大志願、來完成人人所企求成功的國民革命　今天在哀痛悲憤的緊張的空氣中、兄弟特提出這些意思、來和各位共勉　要知革命不是表面的　革命要先革心、我們應大家立起這樣的决心、來成就我們未來的革命大事業、完了、</p>
<p>代表演說　市長張岳軍·市執委潘公展·均有悲切之演說、分記其詞如次、﹁張市長之演詞﹂各位同志、今天我們大家來參加黄花崗七十二烈士殉國的紀念、在這個時候、我們的心裏、充滿着尊敬與崇拜、同時更感覺得非常的哀感與悲悼、剛才主席說、我們紀念七十二烈士、便要繼續他們的遺志、而完成他們的信仰、我們曉得、黄花崗烈士之所以能够爲國犧牲、是基於他們有一種中心信仰、這種中心信仰、便是總理的遺敎、本黨的主義、有了這個中心信仰、才能完成國民革命、才能完成民衆需要的建設、所以這個中心信仰、也就是全國民衆的中心信仰、個人於此、尚有補充的、是我們要拿這個中心信仰建設起來、鞏固起來、使全國的民衆、都同在這個中心信仰之下、共同努力、必得有很多先知先覺的犧牲代價、總理遺敎、當然有很多的人、未能了解、要很多的人都能了解總理的主義、必得有偉大的流血來感動才行、因此、黄花崗七十二烈士的犧牲、遂煥發了主義之花、如上海的陳英士先生、當時因有辫子、又是近視、不得已坐着轎子、從家裏來到上海、然後才把上海的革命基礎、建設起來、我們中心信仰的中心精神、就是智仁勇、我們所謂的智、就是總理所謂的大知、不是細智小慧、以别人之犧牲、謀個人的利益的知、是大智大慧的智、如對於民族的地位、知道如何使他鞏固、對於民　的實施、知道如何使牠　展、對民生的建設、知道如何使牠努力實現、明瞭世界的潮流、認識中國現在所處的地位、阻礙革命前途的反動勢力、非根本消滅不可、一切我們都要看到、一切都要澈底的去做、這就是我們的知的修養、所以我們要抱定中心信仰去努力、仁就是人人皆有的仁心、但是一般人、祗知道所謂的婦孺之仁、假仁假義的仁、不能看到人類的利益、就不是總理所謂的博愛之人、所以這一點、第一應當看清楚的、勇當然也不是匹夫之勇、是有理性的勇、是視死如歸的大勇、不是好勇鬭狠的惡勇、是總理所謂勇者無懼的勇、是爲國家爲同胞爲人類爲世界、無論何種利益所不能誘動、無論何種威武所不能屈撓的、一個人在社會上、受着社會的責難、用不着灰心、這樣的勇、才可以使我們的中心信仰鞏固而光大、我們想到總理交代我們的智仁勇三者、乃天地之大德也、便是大家修養的準則、方才廳到主席說的相信中心力量的重要影響、就想起七十二烈士以及未死於難的、有很多是我的朋友、我知道、他們都有很大的能力、對於智仁勇三者、都有充分的修養、他們的仁　他們的智　他們的勇、是大家所能深切認識的、他們有時自已爲主義犧牲、視死如歸的偉大精神　才能把中心信仰貫澈了、使總理的主義、走上實現的大道　個人在今天這個悲憤紀念會上、覺得有幾多感慨　想我們太家、都能以七十二烈士爲模範　以七十二烈士的修養爲修養、共同爲革命努力　一定可以使我們的革命　于最短期間完成、不要說我們同志少、或者同志對于主義的認識淺薄　就是同志間有什麽糾紛　只要大家依照七十二烈士的精神修養、依照中心信仰共同努力、則國家的自由平等　民生的建設、在最近都有希望的、﹁潘公展之演辭﹂今天我們大家、在這一個地方、追悼黄花崗七十二烈士、方才聽到主席與張市長的演說和報告、我想起在場的諸同志、還有未到會的一般同志與民衆、想到黄花崗七十二烈士的犧牲流血、一定都會泣然下淚　一定都會感慨悲慣、方才聽到主席和市長的講演、都使我們深切知道、要爲革命爲民衆而努力、學當日黄花崗七十二烈士的榜樣、記得總理有一次也是在黄花崗烈士的紀念會上、總理說﹁紀念黄花崗烈士　當學黄花崗烈士的道德、﹂在總理的說話當中、祗有一句、就是各個人都要犧牲他的一切、生命當然也在其内、爲國家爲社會服務、以服務爲目的　不以爭奪權利爲目的、方才聽到的也是如此、主席還講過、我們以後努力的方向、張市長又講過、我們以後當以智仁勇爲修養、所以現在要我再說、也說不出什麽了、且就張市長所講的智仁勇這點上來補充幾句吧　知的範圍·仁的範圍·勇的範圍·都是很廣大的、就七十二烈士說、當然有同時起義而幸免於難的　不過起義的全體說、也是很少的數目、僅僅幾十人、爲什麽能成功如此偉大的事業呢、這不能不使我們欽佩到萬分、現在本黨的同志有多少、少說則有十萬、多說則二十萬、總是有的、旣有二十萬的黨員、爲什麽還不能用他們的力量來完成七十二烈士的事業、爲什麽現在的統一是假的、爲什麽反動的軍閥反動的政客反動的文人　還不停的在那里搗亂、我們不用駡反動份子的囂張、我們要駡二十萬黨員連我也在内、上自中央、下到區分部、大衆都要痛切的自已引責、爲什麽不能如七十二烈士的偉大和成功、我們知道、七十二烈士所以能够成功的、在知已知後、第一要緊的、我們要知道自已、我們每天、當總理紀念週或今天的靜默的時候、我們想想七十二烈士做下這種事業　是完全爲社會爲民衆謀幸福的、我們每做一事、是不是爲國家爲大多數人做的、有没有一絲毫的自私心、要痛切反省　要能知道　什麽地方是當改的、什麽地方是當努力的、這樣才可使自已無愧、才可以做一個革命者、如若糊里糊塗終日昏昏、那里能繼續先烈們的遺志呢、所以每當一天過去、我們便要自問、這天做的事、有無益於社會、如若没有益於社會的話、那末這天便算白過了、如果一天不致白過、才是革命的智者、仁是什麽呢　張市長說過、就是博愛、也就是忠恕、已所不欲勿施於人　忠恕可以說就是博愛的起點、亦即仁的起點、這樣便使人與人的隔膜消除、但是我們能不能如此做呢、我相信一定有時是不能的、我們應當這樣的想、我們爲什麽要救民衆的痛苦呢　便要知道、我們也是民衆之一、民衆的痛苦、就是我們身受的痛苦、從這一點出發去解放民衆、才是眞心的革命、才能對症發藥、所以革命的仁者、當以忠恕爲出發點勇呢、方才大的勇已經張市長講過了、我要說的、除了殺身成仁是大勇外、我們每發現了自已的過錯時便要馬上改過、這也是勇、我講的勇、也是從個人勇說起、我們有什麽錯處　有那一件事做得不對、都不要緊、拿總理的遺敎爲模範、我們有錯處、就要自已明白、要接受人家的指導　勇於改過　如果有人不接受人家的意見、那麽便是錯到底、是没有辦法了、是連學七十二烈士也不配、總而言之、第一當曉得自已、第二當以自已的心、推測民衆的痛苦　而設法解决他們、第三勇予改過自新、能如此、才能爲國家、才能爲民衆努力、才够得上學黄花崗七十二烈士的精神的萬分之一、千分之一、完了、</p>

<h3>黄花節史片</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>三月二十九日　爲十九年前廣州七十二烈士死難之一大紀念。而亦即先總理革命第十次失敗之一役。言其歷史。實足與三月十九日明思宗煤山殉國。並埀不朽。而黄花崗上之英魂毅魄。尤足以令人憑弔欷歔。而不能自已也。</p>
<p>黄花崗。在廣州之北郭十五里許。位於白雲山麓。初本名紅花崗。故葬烈士之潘達微。有﹁諮議局前新鬼錄。紅花崗上黨人碑﹂之題。嗣以紅音不及黄之偉大而壯烈。兼以粤音紅與黄同。遂以黄字易之。而黄花崗三字。乃與白雲山輝映於大地矣。</p>
<p>先是粤中遇難。謂必逢九。故三月二十九日後。孫武熊秉坤蔡濟民等。至八月十九日遂以砲轟督署聞。而即以立中華民國之基。雖其說爲智者所不信。而證諸粤中歷刦。有若符契。當時參加革命者。亦未始不因之而鼓其勇氣。其能執殳前驅。而抵死不屈者以此。時有所謂啞黨人者。姓程。名良。被逮後。由提督李準嚴刑訊鞫。雖榜掠無一言。唯以速死二字請。卒就義。而是役趙聲伯先。其名最著。原籍吾蘇丹徒縣。且曾爲標統於南京。嗣爲彊吏所疑。不得不解職以去。至粤。遂任新軍標統。復爲粤督張鳴岐所忌。乃逃日本。迨回。躬與斯役。而或謂與黄克强敗後。縋城以出。而訾議伯先。實由港入粤。聞某女士言。黨中有清廷之間諜。省垣已戒備。故遂稍後。非有所退縮也。伯先雖含憤以殁。不在七十二鬼雄之列。而名獨著者。蓋匪無因。以親受機宜於庇能總理之寓所。故其任務。實在胡毅生鄧澤如輩之上。故趙雖後死。仍不失爲屍骨叢中血腥隊裏之一前鋒。故特表之。</p>

<p>合肥王季和君。近著有虎邱百詠。各附注語。排印分贈友人。余亦得一册。卷首有題辭者數人。顧藝蘭君題七絶兩首。其第二首注云。已已春。余與董曉岑諸君。游虎邱劍池上。忽見四角危亭中。轟石碑。高五六尺。刻可中亭三字。大逾尺。急招同游往觀。已杳。嗣質諸李伯琦先生。先生云。古籍有謂山市者。或即此歟。顧君第二詩。并錄於下云。虎邱勝境昔曾經。幻跡相逢事　冥。我與山靈應有舊。荒　忽現可中亭。按李先生僑居吳門。可就訪之。顧君里第何處。尚未悉也。</p>
<h3>且廬會食記</h3>
<p>— 洗眼重來客</p>
<p>上星期三。會食於友人孟遺愚之且廬。主人於前三日折柬相招。附以條件。及期會食者。并主人而僅五人。其會食法之組織。獨出心裁。而席間之事事物物。亦皆可紀。即所謂且廬者。伍於塵囂中。亦不隣於俗惡狹隘。座客大樂。囑余爲之紀。其條件中之最要者。則使諸客得柬後各點二肴。註明烹調之法。立即郵復。主人照單備物。命家人如法製之。其次要者。酒亦由客各自携一瓶往。而入席鐘點果愆期後至於法定鐘點二十分外者。是日酒食之費。則由此客獨力負擔。赴約過早。在法定鐘點一小時以前先到者。亦責成負擔用費十之四。果能入廚下爲助手得力者免。是日下午五時客皆到。無敢先後。惟一人先五分鐘至。條約之效力。乃能一矯赴飲延挨之弊。此其可紀者一。酒不外高梁花彫。肴不外鷄魚鴨肉。而味盡適口。酒亦不强人飲。有一客。女士也。量獨宏。所携爲上等白蘭地。瓶罄矣。供食猶未過半。且清談娓娓。不爲酒困。餘亦略能盡興。適可而止。無座起喧嘩拇戰賭酒之聲。此其可紀者二。且廬爲一幢三層樓之新建築。主人手書且住爲佳四字横幀。懸於中。左壁皆吾國名人書畫。右則以新藝術之油畫。懸之以鏡。主人伉儷年皆逾三十矣。態度嫻雅。膝下子女三人。盡彬彬有禮。最穉者方六歲。亦不頑皮。斯人斯廬。皆如初寫黄庭。恰到好處。此其可紀者三。酒酣。因中有一客。先期並未點菜。而自携罐頭食物以來。主人將罰之。又因條約上並未載有不許用罐頭之說。乃請客述故事一則爲衆下酒。客曰。十年前。皖省和縣有老人慶壽。其表姪潛携罐頭鰣魚。臨時自入廚下。蒸而獻之。座客以時方嚴寒。動色以問。隣人且有疑爲吕仙游戲者。云云。說雖滑稽。可見鄉村開化之不易。因附記之。此客名張上達。六合人。女酒客程黄毓英。吳縣人。主人婦孟尤璜與主人皆靖江人。</p>
<h3>河豚贅談</h3>
<p>— 王梅</p>
<p>讀覺迷君河豚考一則。其於河豚之種類名稱。彚萃羣書。詳加考訂。自非博洽。何以堪之。不侫於此物從不下箸。而聞見所得。敢舉以質當世。閱者請以覺迷爲經。不侫則竊取傳之義焉。按河豚味美而毒重。已酉庚戌之間。梅　于役江陰。士紳鄉農。爭以爲餽。拜受而不敢嘗。嗣游桃花港。聞村氓聚談。謂前日之日。港外有江北　　船泊於岸。船中六日。計一夫一婦一子三女。長女年十歲。瞥見隣船　　上。密排假子　烈日中。以語其母曰。彼船空無人。可攫而得也。江北鄉愚率貪小利。母女共收隣船蝦子。盪槳移舟去。及明日而六人駢死於船。無一得免者。蓋旣得蝦子。煑麵大嚼。一家同飽。至夜半。隣船聞呼號聲。起視之。皆轉側翻騰。先後斃命。曠野宵分。坐視莫救。亦不知其何病也。繼見碗盞未滌。尚有子纍纍。乃知中河豚子毒。而曝魚子之舟人。亦正以失物爲怪。相離不遠。事遂脗合。會至黄山。見村人比户食河豚。爲之咋舌。一老者曰。油麻子漲脹。但能熬油至一晝夜。煑魚子至六小時。則油不麻。子之漲性已足。即不毒。且甚美也。因揭釜蓋以示我。魚子一粒。大如黄豆。且謂煑僅一小時。彼一餐而食魚子如恒河沙數。皆未經一煑。入腹而漲。其不使食腸寸斷也可乎。又古語云。生年逢卯。食河豚必死。卯木也。木屬肝。此與覺迷君所述肝最毒之說相合。然寅亦木也。何獨忌卯。天下多美婦人。何必是。吾於河豚亦云。一說河豚宜於空曠處烹之。一染灰塵。則無論如何泡製。皆能死人。而古今嗜之者。且至形於吟詠。抑知甚美之必有惡耶。</p>
<p>短訊　聶少萱魏福蓀等所組織之八佾雅集。成立未久。成績殊佳。茲擇於國暦四月六日。假座西藏路寗波同鄉會彩唱一晝夜。以資紀念。聞劇目有全本探母。及全本瓊林宴等。均甚吃重。並有胡琴票友數人。同時亦加入奏演云。</p>

<h3>荀慧生南來雜談</h3>
<p>— 重良</p>
<p>荀慧生自搭天蟾載譽北歸之後。與滬人暌别者。計兩易葛裘。其間有蘭芳艶秋小雲三大名旦。相繼來滬獻藝。客臘。蘭芳行將游美。艶秋見制於同班配角。有憤而改業之謠。小雲南來不利。不願再蹈覆轍。赫赫有名之三大金剛。一時皆無來滬可能。春申歌壇。幾致冷落。大舞台適於此時聘定金剛名旦之荀慧生。滬上菊部。頓呈葱　氣象。故慧生此行。明眼人已預知其必大紅也。</p>
<p>大舞台本與慧生訂一月合同。後又請續半月。連帮忙及新正半月日戲在内。共約八十日。平旦中未有由台主敦請而延期如此之久者。（特點一）演期旣長。賣座又能始終保持十足盛况。（特點二）不過呌座力之所以不衰者。端賴層出不窮之新戲。新戲之中。尤須有幾齣看家戲。方保無慮。而慧生竟有玉堂春十三妹得意緣盤絲洞四劇之多。（特點三）可謂難能可貴矣。</p>
<p>慧生所帶之配角。極爲整齊。尤以美蓉草爲最出色。其人演戲。一絲不苟。青衣花旦。罔一弗佳。得意緣之二夫人。十三妹之張金鳳。爲慧生生色不少。馬富禄之丑角。戲本不錯。惟有時軼出範圍。便失規矩。然此君亦有一部份呌座力。金仲仁之小生。以較王又荃之瘟。姜妙香之女性化。高出多多。十三妹之安公子。最爲對工。一副書痴獃像。堪稱一絶。</p>
<p>慧生曾於上週應大中華唱片公司之聘。灌片六張。戲碼係玉堂春。（自十六歲開懷起。至拐帶銀兩回南京止。與蓓開百代高亭所灌慧生之玉堂春。緊相聯接。可合成一整齣三堂會審）。探親相駡（全齣由富祿配彩旦）十三妹（弓硯緣之二六。由富祿配四句花臉。鴻鸞禧（洞房棒打之念白）。翠屏山（出帳之南梆子夾念白）。及醉酒（接駕及戲裴力士二段四平）。樣片當於次日做奸。慧生聆過。極贊大中華收音技術之精進。舒舍予君的係慧生不可多得之益友。慧生敬之如師。荀社中人。對於慧生。亦愛護備至。慧生今獲此美滿結果。諸君心血。終未浪費點滴也。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（一五九）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十回　赤燄騰天勾欄欽孝女　紅毹貼地即席晤名伶</p>
<p>蕊雲一回來了。便有報告伊。說阿囡。你前天在跑馬廳對過許多人一同拍的那個照片。二少已經拿了來咧。蕊雲一面換衣服。一面說道。拿來我看。我不是拍壞了嗎。含雲道。一點也没有拍壞。而且很自然很寫意。蕊雲把那照片移到電光之下。自然是先看自已。看了却不說什麽。然後便批論起别人來。說某人的面孔側了。某人立得不好。左詩晨想。對於伊自已不說什麽。那是心裏一定滿意了。倘然看了自已不滿意。一定先要嚷出來了。什麽不好。什麽不好。而且一定就要和我吵。雖然伊也知道照相不是我拍的。至於批論到别人。那就可見自已没什麽可批評之處。他心中好像一塊石頭也落下去了。照尋常日子回來。伊一定是很起勁。而且是左詩晨拿了這照片來。而且這照片上自已拍得也很滿意。一定也要商量配什麽鏡架子。預備掛在什麽地方。廂房裏呢。或是亭子間裏。或者又要發起叉小麻雀啊。挖花啊。因爲今天辰光還不算晏咧。可是今天看伊不大起勁。看過了那個照片以後。仍舊袋好在那個紙封袋裏。呌阿金罷在衣櫉裏。就預備喫稀飯。又問了一問左詩晨道。你肚裏餓嗎。也喫一點粥好嗎。不過没有什麽小菜。左詩晨道。你喫。我不餓。蕊雲道。時二少這樣每人送一張。倒也送去不少呢。左詩晨道。十二個人送去十二張。此外還印了好幾張。詩晨給伊講話。總覺得伊有些不起勁。因想起阿金是伊的副官長。問伊便知道。便在伊喫完了稀飯進去洗臉的時候。問阿金道。阿囡今天好像有些不起勁。是什麽緣故。阿金道。不是給伊的娘爭了兩句嗎。詩晨道。嗄。爲什麽事呢。阿金道。有一位姓葉的客人。想詩阿囡看戲。阿囡自然蠻高興。答應了這個客人了。却是没有和大阿姨說。大阿姨不大願意。說你去看一夜天戲。堂唱要脫去交關。呌含雲鳳雲去代代吧。客人都不窩心。甚而至於打退票。有的還在局票上寫明﹁蕊雲不來不要來。﹂你不能謝謝葉大少嗎。現在旣然答應了他。那末到九點鐘的時候。你到戲館裏去敷衍一下子。馬上就走。倘然堂唱出定得早的。到十一點半鐘再去。阿囡就不高興。說十一點半鐘。戲館也散了。還去看戲屁股嗎。人家好意請我看戲。扯人家的冷台。索性回絶人家了吧。</p>

<h3>紗花　標紗花交割經過紀略</h3>
<p>紗額···七、七五○擔</p>
<p>花額···七、七○○包</p>
<p>人標交割價一百五十二兩　三月期標紗在月初市呈平靜、某廠商態度强硬、在二月份收進之貨　關緊不售、故市氣甚堅、價格在五六兩之間盤旋、十日後因天津青島等帮需要發展、包額殊巨、致人心略佳、曾到一百五十八兩、未幾實銷停滯、時局生謠、倉庫中囤積二十支五福牧羊及十支粗紗殊厚、走銷呆寂、各廠存貨亦日漸增加、市勢頗形衰弱、嗣至二十號外、賣方在外搜羅現紗、約有六千五百包、且五福牧羊佔多數、於是某廠商之多頭、亦現不安之狀、鑒於紗布倉庫中積貨約有二萬七八千包之巨、將所多之額、如數賣出了結、無意收貨、市盤驟鬆、最低跌至一百五十兩零二錢、後以賣方購進收貨、市氣略定、又回漲二兩外、結果交割價爲一百五十二兩、共計七千七百五十包、品物二十支牧羊一、九五○包、五福一·九五○包十支得利一五○包、寳彝五百包、其餘三千二百五十包、爲自行交割、收貨均係空頭、交貨三十六號十七號兩號爲最多、茲將各經紀人牌號及包額分誌於後、</p>

<p>漢標交割價二十五兩　三月份花價月初在三十五兩盤旋、因各　來　欠缺、漢口　　高昻、故漢帮拉緊不放、頗有軋空氣象、所以市氣堅挺、後以美棉趨跌、人心略疲稍跌、曾見三十四兩三錢五分、未幾美棉回漲一一百磅音、形勢愈緊、買方態度十分强硬、散户視大勢良好、交貨缺乏、扒空者見踴、市盤驟漲、最高曾到三十五兩七錢、嗣至月末最後一盤、忽然暴跌七錢五分、爲三十四兩五錢、因買方大户無收貨之决心故遂猝跌、結果交割價爲三十五兩、交割數共計七千七百擔、總值二六九·五○○兩、内中自行交割亦不少、交割品火機太倉本花均有、交貨二號一○二號爲最多、收貨一號爲獨多、茲將收交兩方經紀人牌號及包量分誌於後、</p>

<h3>交割日現紗花一瞥</h3>

<h3>糧食　米市銷呆續定</h3>
<p>閘北　昨日各　來二十號　右、受阻　道已通　惟市中存積極薄　各店胃因已屆月底、一致觀望不動、故全日銷塲大呆、北粳行情無上落二十元關外之米貨客不　脫　買方不敢購辦、緣自當局嚴限後、時有調查、是以雙方均趨沉靜、惟可慮者、一且店方存底告罄、勢必採買、屆時不免發生特殊情形耳、薄留由堅轉平、走銷清淡、羊杜尖河下寥寥　且外埠客帮大部往内地產區動買、故本埠連日無到、交易大爲沉寂、祗客埠尖稍有做開、行情續挺、白元市勢平庸、無榮　可言、</p>
<p>滬南　河下到船不多、本街去路尚化　蘇常帮機粳交易見减、中關貨有鄉莊入手　價格一律平定　南帮飛來鳳等薄早稻買氣不惡　緣臨市買客、因粳稀關係而轉注此貨、進出活潑、大盤與前日相同、因不易見鬆也、羊秈存到兩枯、在前兩市尚有南路貨應市、昨益凋零、杜秈盤面步緊、洋米上漲後、買客仍以本秈爲標準、故後首頗有向上之態、變元陰化酒坊銷路轉暢　來路亦不旺、頂貨開十八元關口、</p>
<h3>洋米期現均轉平勢</h3>
<p>昨日洋米新到兩船人心轉定一本客因有前定路貨裝運、現銷反淡　統市現貨祗開一號西貢二百包　價十五元六角、小絞六百包　價十四元八角半、敏當五百包、價十五元二角半、均比前市跌小角許　現貨旣呆　路貨亦乏去化、期貨隨跟人心下趨　上午跌小一錢　午後略定　但交易不多、統市祗開一千三百噸云、</p>

<p>空頭廠家已交進棧單五萬包</p>
<p>浮多回出了結市面突遭打擊</p>
<p>昨日期市上午開盤時、各月份仍見穩定、本月份初開即爲二兩五錢七分七厘半、遠期各月份亦見平穩、惟客帮並無實胃、此種無端之抬住、頗不正式也、迨至下午開盤、三四月份突受打擊、以空頭廠家、已交進棧單五萬包、（聞係三星牌）因此本月份浮多、除亟事回出了結、已無他法、蓋實銷旣不活動、此種棧單、外行實不能購辦、故市面遂大見鬆動、收盤相近、曾回到二兩五錢五分、與上午初開計跌去二分七厘半、四月份衝動亦甚、遠期稍瘥、觀此種毫無實力之多頭、謂爲純屬投機、亦無不可也、結果本月份較前日跌一分七厘半、四月份跌一分、五月份小五厘、六七月份小二厘半、八月份小五厘云、</p>
<h3>小麥隨粉市回鬆</h3>
<p>現貨做開五千餘包</p>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤時、各月份初仍堅勁、如四月六月曾好一二分不等、旋以粉市轉平、故亦趨和緩、迨至下午開盤、以麫粉已有巨額抛出、客帮則不動、人心到此地步、未免虛呆、故開價即見步鬆、結果四月份回小二分、六七月份各小一分、八月份小二分、現麥廠胃仍佳、以中小廠家、麫粉抛出者頗巨、故現麥需要、亦隨之激增、開清江浦麥五兩一錢三分、南宿州蚌埠麥徐州麥五兩一錢三分、五兩一錢二分、明光麥五兩一錢、五兩零八分、漢口麥四兩七錢八分、四兩五錢、共開五千三百五十包云、</p>

<h3>National Government Appoints Han Fuqu as Commander-in-Chief for Bandit Suppression in Three Provinces</h3>
<p>Han Sends Representatives to Visit He and Liu</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, the National Government issued an order specially appointing Han Fuqu as the Commander-in-Chief for Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Han Fuqu's representative, Liu Mingyang, arrived in Nanjing from Wuhan on the morning of the 29th. In the afternoon, he visited He Yingqin, reporting that Han still wished to serve the Central Government and harbored no disloyal intentions. It is said that Liu plans to stay in Nanjing and leave after reporting everything to Chiang Kai-shek. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Han Fuqu sent Li Shuchun to Xuzhou on the 28th to visit Liu Zhi and discuss military affairs. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>Northern Activist Factions Face Considerable Difficulties in Organization</h3>
<p>Problems in Finance and Diplomacy</p>
<p>Yan Prepares to Assume the Position of Commander-in-Chief</p>
<p>(Beiping) Reports indicate that the establishment of a Beiping government is difficult to realize at this time due to: 1. Financial problems: the monthly military expenses of the various armies in Henan amount to a considerable sum. The government would need to establish five departments, including finance, internal affairs, foreign affairs, and military affairs, requiring hundreds of thousands of dollars each month. Currently, borrowing from the Tianjin banking community requires collateral. Zhao Pilian and others came to Beiping with the mission of negotiating financial matters. It is said that various parties have reached partial understanding and will provide some financial support. A decision will be made after Zhao returns to Shanxi. 2. The issue of government personnel: whether the government will be composed of members from Yan, Feng, and Wang's factions, or whether members from the Gui, An, and Zhi factions will be included, is still under consideration. 3. Diplomatic problems: foreign groups have not reached an understanding with Yan. The above three items are the prerequisites. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Reports state that Zhang Xueliang replied to Yan with a letter carried to Shanxi by Wen Shouquan, in which he approved of Yan's consistent advocacy of peace and stated that the Northeast would absolutely not participate in any fighting. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) With the situation becoming increasingly tense and numerous telegrams urging him to take office, Yan Xishan has decided to assume the position of Commander-in-Chief on April 1st or early in the month to command the various armies. (Telegraphic dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Capital Garrison Headquarters announced a lurid telegram from Beiping: (1) Yan Xishan spent a large sum of money to bribe Wan Xuancai to attack Kaifeng from Zhengzhou, and ordered Sun Chu's reinforcements to implement the encirclement after arriving from Kaifeng. (2) Shi Yousan is now isolated and intends to avoid the railway line and declare neutrality. Both Yan and Feng have sent representatives to lure him with funds and ammunition for their own use. Recently, guests have filled Xinxiang. It is reported that Shi stated that if Yan does not fulfill the previous agreement and immediately issue military pay and supplies, he will maintain neutrality. (3) Yan is unable to assist Sun Dianying and will let him survive or perish on his own. (4) There is no news of the five divisions of the Shanxi army south of Daming. The Northwest Army is concentrated on the Longhai Railway. The main forces of the western section are watching in Luoyang and Gongxian without advancing. Cooperation between Yan and Feng is likely to be unsustainable. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>Northern Hubei Defense is Solid</h3>
<p>Xu Yuanquan Takes the Opportunity to Reconnoiter Xichuan</p>
<p>(Hankou) Zhu Chuanjing, a senior staff officer of the General Headquarters, flew from Fancheng to Hankou on the Xiangyang aircraft on the 28th. According to him, the fortifications in northern Hubei are very solid. Fan Shisheng is currently in Xiangyang, and Xiao Zhichu is in Fancheng. The morale of each unit is very high. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Xu Yuanquan flew to Xichuan on the morning of the 28th for reconnaissance and returned to Fancheng at noon. He claimed that there were no rebel traces in the Xichuan area, only a small number of bandits who were scattered by the bombing. He also said that the establishment of an office of the General Headquarters in Xiangyang has not yet materialized. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) He Guoguang received a telegram from Liu Jianqun on the 28th, stating that He Yingqin will come to Hankou after Chiang Kai-shek arrives in Nanjing. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui Cables That the Russian Side is Holding Firm to Preconceived Notions</h3>
<p>Requests Negotiations Based on the Khabarovsk Protocol</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mo Dehui sent an urgent telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 28th, stating that according to an informal notification from the Russian side, the Sino-Russian conference must discuss the overall issue based on the Khabarovsk Protocol. In addition to various post-settlement issues in the East Road, other issues such as navigation rights on the Songhua River, the independence of Outer Mongolia, the demarcation of the Xinjiang border, and the ten items, including the issue of compensation for Soviet Russia's dispatch of troops during the East Road disputes, must be discussed. The matter is of great importance and instructions on the policy should be requested for response. (29th)</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Legal Rights Negotiations</h3>
<p>Content of Our Proposed Draft</p>
<p>Current Situation of the Japanese Consular Trial System</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese consular jurisdiction, Minister Wang and Shigemitsu have begun negotiations, and our side has submitted a proposal. It has been learned from a certain source that the contents of the draft are roughly as follows: (1) Request that Japan recognize the abolition of consular jurisdiction in China. (2) Starting from 1930, all Japanese residents in the Chinese mainland must be protected by Chinese law. In case of litigation, it should be subject to the jurisdiction of Chinese courts. (3) Korean residents in the Jian Dao area should obey Chinese law and be governed by Chinese local authorities. (4) After the expiration of Japanese concessions in China, all Japanese residents should be protected by Chinese law. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to an investigation by the government, the current situation of the Japanese consular jurisdiction trial system in China is roughly as follows: Japanese consular jurisdiction in China is exercised by consuls in various places using a sole-judge system, responsible for the first instance of all civil and criminal lawsuits. However, in criminal cases requiring preliminary review, they may only conduct preliminary reviews, and the public trial is transferred to the Nagasaki District Court. Also, when the Minister of Foreign Affairs deems it necessary, he may prohibit consuls from administering various cases, which are handled by domestic courts or colonial courts. Those who are dissatisfied with the consul's judgment may appeal to the Nagasaki Court of Appeals or the District Court, depending on the severity of the case. The third instance is conducted at the Tokyo Supreme Court. However, in the three northeastern provinces, appeals against consular judgments must be made to the Guandongzhou High Court or the District Court, depending on the severity of the case, and this is the final instance, with no appeal to the Supreme Court.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Political Turmoil in Germany and France and the Young Plan</h3>
<p>The recent political turmoil in Germany and France, triggered by financial issues, can be traced back to the Young Plan, which aimed to resolve the issue of war reparations after the Great War. When the German parliament passed the Young Plan, intense disputes arose. The current stalemate between various parties over the financial reorganization plan originated from this. The turmoil in the French parliament today is due to the request from left- and right-wing members to postpone the approval of the Young Plan. From this, it can be seen that the issue of reparations left over from the Great War ten years ago still affects the political tides of both the victorious and defeated sides. Alas, the disaster of war is severe.</p>
<p>After the end of the extremely brutal Great War, due to the difficulty in resolving the issue of reparations, a reparations committee was organized. Germany firmly refused, claiming that it could not afford the amount determined by the committee. As a result, the Allied forces invaded the Ruhr, causing great disturbances. Meetings were repeatedly held in Paris and Berlin. After concessions were made by the Allied side, the so-called Dawes Plan was established. After the London Conference signed the agreement, disputes over the issue arose again. Another conference of experts was convened in Paris, and the so-called Young Plan agreement was established. This plan, compared with the Dawes Plan, involved further concessions by the Allied side. Both sides expressed agreement, so it should not have been a problem. However, disputes arose again over the location of the meeting to implement this plan. Finally, a reparations conference was held in The Hague in August of last year to resolve the method of distributing these reparations. During that time, the Allied side, due to differences in opinions on interests, almost broke down again. Fortunately, after strenuous mediation, mutual understanding was reached. The German reparations issue was thus completely resolved, and the stationed troops began to withdraw. I have described the above past history to show that this Young Plan went through extremely large disputes and difficulties before its establishment, and extremely large storms and dangers after its establishment. It took several conferences of experts and representatives and countless verbal and written arguments to achieve this effect, which can be described as extremely hard-won. Unexpectedly, even now, with only the issue of passage and approval remaining, parts of the German and French parliaments are still expressing dissatisfaction and causing cabinet turmoil. Although there may be people who are taking advantage of the issue to attack the government, the cause is ultimately not unrelated to the impact left by the Great War. I am thus increasingly lamenting that the realization of peace cannot be delayed.</p>

<h3>Commemoration of the Martyrs' Sacrifice at Huanghuagang</h3>

<h3>Mediterranean Security Agreement: Anglo-French Negotiations Stalled</h3>
<p>The French Side Is Quite Pessimistic</p>
<p>British and American Representatives Met Once Yesterday</p>
<p>Japan Plans to Accept the American Plan with Conditions</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 29th - It is widely rumored among those at the Naval Conference this morning that the Anglo-French negotiations on the conclusion of a Mediterranean Security Agreement have completely stalled. The French side is extremely pessimistic. It is expected that the French side will go to Chequers this evening and return to London tomorrow evening. There will be no mutual visits this week. Only the Italian representative, Grandi, is scheduled to go to Chequers for lunch tomorrow. The British side does not seem to care about criticism from the outside world.</p>
<p>Telecommunications Agency, London, 28th - With the London Conference in a stalemate, an informally organized special committee by Britain, the United States, and France has been formed to study the possibility of a so-called political agreement as a glimmer of hope. The committee held its first meeting at 11:30 this morning at the residence of the British Foreign Secretary. The agreement on the form of the agreement lasted for more than an hour.</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 28th - Today, apart from a conversation between British Prime Minister MacDonald and U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, there were no gatherings among the representatives of the Naval Conference. The chief representatives of each country will not meet again until Monday morning, but experts may continue to have contact, as the work of informal discussions on ways to reach an agreement and studying the political status of the issue has now been transferred to experts. Tonight, the British government hosted a reception for representatives of various countries in the House of Lords. After that, the British Prime Minister went to his villa for vacation and will return to London on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 28th - Senator Swanson issued a statement today, saying that if the naval consultation agreement proposed by the United States at the Naval Conference is signed, it would be tantamount to restoring the old power blocs that were the source of war. This kind of agreement will either force the United States to bear European political obligations or trap the entire United States in the quagmire of European powers. Rather than doing this, it would be better to withdraw from the Naval Conference altogether or join the League of Nations. This is enough to show that the Southern Democrats are determined to unite with the Republican reactionaries of the Western states to jointly resist the ratification of this agreement.</p>
<p>Reuter, Tokyo, 29th - According to reliable sources, the instructions to the Japanese representatives at the London Naval Conference will be decided at the Cabinet meeting to be held on April 1st. The contents of the instructions have not yet been ascertained, but it is generally expected that Japan will accept the figures proposed by the American representatives to the Naval Conference with some reservations. These reservations, except for the Tokyo extremist faction, can satisfy all parties and avoid the breakdown of the Naval Conference.</p>
<p>Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, 29th - Foreign Minister Shidehara is currently carefully revising the content of the return instructions, which are roughly as follows: (1) Acknowledge the Japanese-American compromise plan, but the amount of large cruisers possessed after 1936 does not abandon 70% of the amount of the United States. The reservation is limited to the short term until 1935. (2) Regarding submarines, in order to maintain shipbuilding technology, reduce the age of ships, and leave room for construction, an agreement is concluded. In order to put the 1936 conference in an advantageous position, Japan requests certain guarantees from Britain and the United States and records them in the annexed document.</p>
<h3>The Future of Germany's Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>Will Usher in a New Era</p>
<p>National Society, Berlin, 28th - All parties are still speculating about the cabinet crisis. Judging from various phenomena, it seems that this 18th new cabinet since the war will usher in a new era in internal affairs. It can be regarded as an era of reorganizing internal affairs after the ratification of the Young Plan. It can be seen that the new Prime Minister, Dr. Brüning, has changed his usual habits and no longer negotiates terms with various factions to persuade them to join the cabinet. This can be regarded as a harbinger of a change of course. Now Dr. Brüning is not uniting various parties to form a government with his support, but selects like-minded talents to submit the proposed policy procedures to the Congress. Whether they can accept it or not is up to nature. If he cannot get a majority of votes, he will try to dissolve the Congress, otherwise, according to the emergency provisions of the Constitution, he will ask the President to exercise extraordinary powers to announce the budget and remove the major reefs in the political struggle. Although extreme faction members are still advocating immediate appeal to the whole country, hoping to consolidate their position by this, most newspapers generally support Dr. Brüning's approach, declaring that at this time there should be courageous policy recommendations to deal with various fundamental issues in internal affairs, and do not sacrifice the actual interests of the country with abstract concepts of partisanship. It is heard that there are no Social Democrats in the list of cabinet members. The party is likely to lose the election at this time, so it is expected that the new cabinet's trend will be slightly more right-leaning, but it will not lead to reaction. The Congress has adjourned until next Tuesday, and it is expected that Dr. Brüning will be able to announce his political方針云。(Continued telegram) Hill, the leader of German agriculturalism, has agreed to join the new cabinet as Minister of Agriculture. Hill is also the leader of the moderate faction of the National Power Party, so it is expected that this move may lead to the split of the National Power Party.</p>
<h3>Formation of the London Conference; A United Anglo-American Front Against Japan</h3>
<p>The Singapore Naval Base Construction is Not a Falsehood</p>
<p>Japan's Pacific Influence Faces Difficulties</p>
<p>China Will Become a Hunting Ground for the Great Powers</p>
<p>London Dispatch: When the British government prepared for the London Conference in early July last year, it announced the cessation of construction of the Singapore naval base. However, its recently released naval budget has increased the construction costs for a portion of the Singapore naval base from £580,000 to £800,000. Because the powers at the London Conference were vying for dominance and unwilling to yield, the future became increasingly bleak. At this time, Britain, which was in a leading position at the conference, suddenly announced an increase in the naval base construction budget, surprising all nations. Japan, which has a close relationship with the Pacific, was particularly suspicious of Britain's move. The representative of the Japanese Navy Ministry participating in the conference secretly contacted representatives from France and journalists, and vehemently criticized Britain's attitude in Europe, arousing international public opinion. Thus, the drama of secret rivalry between Japan, Britain, and the United States, centered on the Pacific, was staged behind the scenes in Europe. The scale of the Singapore naval base construction is, in fact, very grand, contrary to what British authorities claim. Its various docks (land and sea, as well as heavy oil storage docks), factories, armories, airfields, batteries, radio and other facilities are not only the largest naval base in the East, but also unparalleled in Europe. The total construction budget reaches over 110 million (converted to Chinese currency). Although the detailed content of the construction and whether the work is proceeding are in doubt, naval and media circles in European countries all directly state that Britain has not abandoned or suspended construction, and is still actively proceeding in secret. At the same time, British public opinion almost universally believes that a fierce conflict between Japan, Britain, and the United States, centered on China, is inevitable in the future. The construction of the Singapore naval base is extremely necessary in British naval policy. Furthermore, many Labor Party leaders also predict that Britain and Japan will inevitably clash in the Pacific, and therefore support the construction of the Singapore naval base. In short, the British construction of the Singapore naval base primarily targets Japan as its hypothetical enemy, followed by the United States. The reason cited by the British authorities that the purpose of building the base is to protect trade in colonies such as Australia and New Zealand is merely a superficial excuse. Recently, the British naval circles have placed great importance on the military value of Hong Kong. After the Singapore naval base is completed, Hong Kong's military facilities will inevitably be updated, becoming an important naval base as well. The distance from Hong Kong to Sasebo and Tokyo in Japan is only 1,000 nautical miles. In recent years, shipbuilding technology has developed rapidly, with submarines capable of cruising over 1,000 nautical miles and aircraft carriers capable of cruising over 3,000 nautical miles. The Singapore naval base also has a large-scale air force. If Britain uses the new base as a base for its new aircraft and fleets, and launches a joint attack on Japan with the forces in Hong Kong, key areas such as Tokyo and Sasebo could feel the threat within a few hours. Even if Japan has a strong defense, it will not be easy to cope with. Furthermore, the US naval base in the Pacific, Honolulu, is only 3,300 nautical miles from Tokyo Bay, and Manila is 1,400 nautical miles from Japan. Although the distance is not as advantageous as that of Britain, the United States, which adheres to the doctrine of large battleships, can assemble its battleships on the Pacific Ocean in a very short period of time, forming a "fleet naval base." At the London Conference, the United States vigorously opposed Japan's demand for a 70% ratio. The Anglo-American alliance clearly regards Japan as a common enemy. In this situation, Japan's expansion of power in the Pacific is unlikely. Even if Japan claims to be a naval power in East Asia, with an aura of invincibility, it is impossible to confront the combined forces of Britain and the United States. So, what path will Japan take in the future? The winds in the Pacific are becoming increasingly urgent, and what kind of changes will occur? Thinking of this, it truly makes us Chinese people, who are being treated as a hunting ground, shudder with fear.</p>
<h3>### 2,000 Earthquakes in Ito District in January</h3>
<p>"Tōkyō nichinichi shinbun" Publishes Large-Character Warning</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 29th: Today's newspapers published in large characters a warning from the Central Meteorological Observatory to residents of the Ito district (approximately 40 miles southwest of Yokohama).

<h3>The Problem of the Succession of the Prince of Monaco</h3>
<p>A Dispute Between France and Germany Is Feared</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 28th: The succession problem of the Prince of Monaco is becoming increasingly complicated due to the successful divorce of Princess Charlotte. This is feared to lead to an international problem. Prince Wilhelm of Urach, Germany, has now arrived in Paris to claim the throne, stating that since Princess Charlotte has lost her succession rights due to divorce, her children naturally no longer have these rights. Prince Wilhelm of Urach, by marriage, should be next in line for the throne. However, according to the treaty between France and Monaco, France should oppose the German prince's succession, making it even more difficult to resolve. However, Prince Wilhelm of Urach claims that this treaty does not authorize France to abolish the succession laws of Monaco. Monaco is a principality, an autonomous state, and legally independent. It is heard that the prince will fight vigorously on this basis, and if necessary, will file a lawsuit in the International Court of Justice.</p>

<p>Continuing Important News</p>
<p>spirit, strive for construction, and realize the Three Principles of the People," "Continue the legacy of the 72 martyrs who died defending against bandits and resisting foreign aggression, eradicate traitors, and implement revolutionary diplomacy." The spirit tablets of the 72 martyrs were enshrined, and two wreaths were placed in front of the martyrs' positions. Hu Hanmin presided over the meeting. After the music was played and salutes were performed, the chairman gave an opening speech, stating that today we commemorate the 72 martyrs who died in Guangzhou on March 29. Recalling the Huanghuagang Uprising 19 years ago, it was one of the most tragic, greatest, and enthusiastic battles. Therefore, every year, people from Guangzhou go to Huanghuagang to pay tribute to the martyrs, a scene that is almost city-wide. At that time, the Tongmenghui, the predecessor of our Party, in order to achieve the goal of national revolution, strived to overthrow the Qing government. At that time, the work was divided into propaganda and practical movements. However, because there was no army directly under the command of our Party at that time, the practical movement focused on the New Army. The New Army was similar in nature to conscription. All officers and soldiers believed that China could only be saved by revolution and were happy to accept the Premier's doctrine. At that time, comrades were worried that there would be no funds for the uprising. Only the Premier believed that funding was not a concern. So, on the one hand, he solicited funds in places such as Nanyang, and on the other hand, Keqiang, Bo Xian, and other gentlemen planned the actual movement. The plans proposed by the comrades all believed that the uprising should be initiated first by Party comrades, and then by other troops. Therefore, the plans all had the word "vanguard." The uprising was originally scheduled for March 25, but was later changed to March 29. On the day of the uprising, more than 70 comrades were killed, injured, and died again. After the event, the names of 72 people were found. Since then, the whole country was shocked, and the Qing government was also alarmed. Then there was the Wuchang Uprising, and the Republic of China was established. Therefore, the Huanghuagang Uprising was of great significance. The martyrs who died were purely committed to the spirit of sacrifice, not just rash bravery. The idea of life, death, and benefits had long been abandoned. Therefore, they were able to move the whole country, the Qing Dynasty collapsed, and the Republic of China was established. Now that the Central Party History Compilation Committee has been established, it should describe the situation in detail at that time to show it to future generations. Today, on the anniversary of the martyrdom of the martyrs, in addition to mourning, we should also commemorate the martyrs' abandonment of the idea of life, death, and benefits, and their pure spirit of sacrifice, etc. After the chairman's report, the eulogy was read, mourning music was played, and the meeting adjourned. The eulogy is attached as follows: "On March 29, the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang respectfully offers a bunch of incense and flowers to the spirits of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang and announces to them: Alas, martyrs, you took righteousness and achieved benevolence, reminiscing about the past, giving your lives in Guangzhou, cutting your tongues and still calling out, and plunging into the enemy with your intestines, falling one after another, moving forward, thousands of troops yielded, the heavens and earth rose and fell, and even ghosts and gods trembled because of it, Huanghua was stained with blood, the grass was desolate and did not bloom in spring, white bones formed mounds, and the soul was generous and even more fierce, the swallow rainbow penetrated the sun, the Vietnam horse startled the gods, the chiefs were depressed, and the rats wept and insects moaned, the Qing court was shaken, and its spirit fled and died, then there was Double Ten, and the great achievements were gathered, who said to make atmosphere, it was not the spirit of the sons, alas, martyrs, not only the pillars of the country, but also the soul of the Party, will be with the country, forever and ever, for half a century, experiencing difficulties and hardships, always remembering to be cautious, fearing to lose the sound of heroes, Hu Tian did not mourn, and suddenly withered the wise men, sad and sad Premier, also abandoned the people, heaven and earth are like darkness, the group of thieves also complained, the old leaves resigned from the Ke, the new oriole fell into the valley, the crane warned Dan and cried itself, the maple did not autumn but changed color, Heng surpassed the Taoist rules, and did not read the air section, ashamed to bear the heroic spirits, Yun Hu can say, alas, martyrs, day Wei Ji Chen, all directions shook and crossed, it is appropriate to have a voice of sorrow, what is hoped is to enlighten, Xian and reform their hearts, to wash away the dirt and vibrate shame, to improve and maintain the new, and to wish a thousand feet of light, long shine on Yu Yu, and the atmosphere of a thousand autumns, Geng fills the Qian Kun, may there be a spirit, actually see this intention, Shang Xiang."</p>
<p>People from All Walks of Life: The capital's people from all walks of life held a memorial service at the First Park at 10:00 AM. More than a thousand people, including representatives from various government agencies and organizations in Beijing and citizens, attended. Xiao Jishan, the chairman of the Beijing Municipal Executive Committee, presided over the meeting. After leading the salutes, Xiao gave an opening speech, stating that today's commemoration of the 72 martyrs is of great significance. The death of the martyrs was for the sake of fighting for national equality, freedom, and the welfare of the 400 million compatriots. However, at that time, the Qing government was deeply rooted, so the martyrs were unable to fulfill their ambitions. However, their tragic death was enough to inspire the determination of our Party comrades to resist the enemy internally, and the international community also knew our enthusiasm for national liberation, which greatly benefited the progress of the revolutionary cause. Now that the situation is getting worse day by day, and the reactionary elements are rising up to besiege us, in addition to commemorating the martyrs today, we should also emulate the spirit of sacrifice and struggle of the martyrs, eliminate all obstacles, and comfort the dead martyrs in the ground. Then, Chen Haicheng, a representative of the Legislative Yuan, and others gave speeches, followed by the playing of mourning music, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Open Letter to Soldiers from the Central Propaganda Department (Continued)</h3>
<p>Our revolutionary soldiers are the armed forces of the entire nation, the vanguard of the revolution, and the bulwark of the Party and the country. They are duty-bound to not coexist with rebels. Therefore, today's suppression of the rebellion is precisely to consolidate the revolutionary forces and is the duty that soldiers should fulfill. If the feudal forces are not eliminated, then the responsibility that the central government has entrusted to the revolutionary soldiers has not been fulfilled. Observing the development of the current situation, it has reached the final struggle period between the feudal remnants and reactionary forces. The central government's preparation to attack Yan and Feng today is also the final decisive battle between our Party and the warlords in the process of national revolution. Yan and Feng have cunning and opportunistic natures, which have been the case for a long time. The central government has repeatedly been tolerant and urged them to reflect, but they have repeatedly mentioned etiquette and concession, falsely claiming peace. Recently, they have become even more intensified, raising the banner of rebellion, taking over the central government's agencies in Tianjin and Beijing, searching for and arresting Party and government workers, and borrowing foreign debts without authorization to use as military expenses, purchasing large quantities of military fire to use as tools for killing compatriots. They gathered reorganized Anfu Party bureaucrats and politicians, and sent their henchmen to instigate chaos in various places with the lure of profit. Advice is not enough to stop their ferocity, and texts are not enough to prick their evil. They are truly the public enemy of the whole people and the sinners of peace. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? If this is not discussed, what Party discipline remains? What national law remains? In order to consolidate the Party and the country, save the people, and maintain our revolutionary armed forces, if Yan is not eliminated for one day, then the source of disaster for the Party and the country will not be eliminated for one day. Now that Yan and Feng have rebelled against the Party, harmed the country, and endangered the people, stirring up chaos and claiming troops, our central government should stop the chaos and denounce them for the sake of saving the Party and the country. The reason for reversing right and wrong is clear. Our revolutionary soldiers should understand this together. Moreover, what revolutionary soldiers obey is the central government. Without the central government, the life of the revolution will not exist. Without the central government, the price of the sacrifice and bloodshed of our revolutionary soldiers will be lost without a trace. The glorious history and personality of the previous revolution will also be lost completely. The foundation of the revolutionary government is not something that can be shaken by one or two ambitious warlords, nor can it be controlled by individuals. The downfall of previous rebellious soldiers such as Tang Zhang Gui's system can serve as a warning. Those who, like Yan and Feng, rush around like pigs and wolves, causing war and claiming disaster, are simply speeding up their own destruction. Our loyal and brave armed comrades throughout the country have been engaged in revolution for many years. They have been well educated in the spirit of wisdom, benevolence, and courage of the Premier, and have personally witnessed the Republic of China that was created by countless heads being thrown and countless blood being shed by the martyrs of the past. Now, there are those who vainly attempt to subvert and endanger it. This is no different from destroying the glorious history of our revolutionary soldiers and destroying the great achievements of our revolutionary soldiers. We should hate and resent them deeply, regard them as enemies of the deepest hatred, and think of arousing the spirit of perseverance and unyieldingness, and the spirit of common hatred and enmity, to show our determination to coexist and die with the Party, and to fight to the death with these rebellious enemies who attempt to shake the Party and the country and destroy unity, sacrificing ourselves for the sake of benevolence, and regarding death as going home. Then, we can add color to our revolutionary army and not be ashamed to be disciples of the late Premier. I wish to encourage this together with my armed comrades throughout the country.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Appeals for Overseas Chinese in Japan</h3>
<p>Recently, Japan has been severely restricting the import of Chinese, wanting to eliminate the position of Chinese in Japan. Lu Weisheng and Chen Anren, members of the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, in view of this, specially proposed a motion, which was passed by the 78th standing committee of the commission, requesting the National Government to instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest. The proposal is recorded as follows: "It is found that Japan's restrictions on the import of Chinese are becoming increasingly strict. At first, it was stipulated that peddlers, merchants, and those in the industrial sector who went to Japan must bring 100 yuan in cash per person. Secondly, it was stipulated that third-class passengers and those who looked like laborers must have a wealthy businessman in Japan to vouch for them, otherwise they would be sent back on the original ship. Now, it has become even more intensified, implementing a fundamental method of blocking: (1) Water police permit. According to its police department's resolution, from March onwards, Chinese in Japan are only allowed to return to their country, and not one more person is allowed to come to Japan. Those who want to return to their country must first go to the local water police station to report and obtain a permit to return to Japan before they are allowed to come again. A telegram has been sent to Japanese shipping companies in various places that they are not allowed to sell ship tickets to anyone without a water police permit. (2) Shipping company deposit. When Chinese people purchase ship tickets to go to Japan, each company must first pay 40 yuan as a deposit ticket. If they are refused landing, this amount will be deducted as shipping fees. (3) Prohibition of Fujianese and laborers. Recently, the Osaka Metropolitan Police Department, on the pretext that a large number of reactionary Chinese have sneaked into Japan, convened a meeting of water police departments in various ports and resolved four matters: (A) It was decided to prohibit Fujianese from entering the country. (B) Chinese laborers are absolutely not allowed to go to Japan. (C) Chinese students and businessmen going to Japan will be investigated for impersonation. (D) The chiefs of the foreign affairs sections of the water police departments in various ports were ordered to strictly comply when Japanese and non-Japanese ships arrive at the port. After these harsh regulations were implemented, many Chinese people who went to Japan were detained and insulted, and then expelled back to their country. However, in Shanghai alone, there have been hundreds of people. With such unreasonable restrictions, the road for Fujianese and Chinese workers to go to Japan in the future will be completely cut off. In order to carry out overseas Chinese affairs, this committee should request the National Government to quickly instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest in order to eliminate the harsh regulations and protect the national system."</p>
<h3>After Liu Heding's Troops Arrived in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Liu and Gui's Brigades Entered the City One After Another</p>
<p>Lin Zhiyuan and Others Still Returned to the Upper Reaches</p>
<p>Fuzhou dispatch, 24th: Part of Liu Heding's 56th Division moved to the provincial capital from Yongtai and Fuqing. On the evening of the 22nd, Liu Shangzhi's brigade had already crossed the river from Xia Dou, and continued to land at dawn. At about 2:00 PM, they entered the city via Guanyin Well along Zhijie, either by public bus or on foot. Eight buses from Fuxing and Fuxia bus companies were sealed and hired. Most of Liu's division entered the East Gate Main Street and the former training department of the East Lake, and some were stationed in Yishan Changqing Temple and the Quanzhe Guild Hall in the West Gate. Its headquarters was located at the former site of the Military Department (formerly the General's Office). Sentries were stationed along the city platform early this morning. By noon, Liu Heding had entered the city. In the afternoon, soldiers were continuously transported into the city by car along the way. The total number of soldiers was almost five regiments. The marine corps brigade originally stationed in the city will move to Qiaonan.</p>
<p>Fuzhou dispatch, 26th: Liu Heding's division moved from Quanzhou to the province, and it has been three days since. Gui Zhenyuan's brigade departed from Yongtai and will be able to arrive completely on a normal day. Chen Wantai's brigade is still stationed outside Quanzhou. Since Liu's division arrived in the province, the provincial government specially ordered the Finance Department on the 25th to allocate 1,000 yuan, prepare 2,000 catties of pork, 50 jars of Fuzhou wine, and 50 bags of flour, and sent Cen Shiwang, the chief of the security section, and Lin Shaoan, the director of the third section, to send a letter to express their condolences, and issued a notice: "Notice regarding the matter. It is noted that the troops of the 56th Division have always had strict military discipline. This time, they were transferred from Quanzhou to defend the provincial capital in accordance with the orders of the central government, specifically to maintain local security. All of our people are protected. All should live and work in peace and contentment, and must not lightly believe rumors and cause disturbances. It is hereby announced to the people for general knowledge. Special announcement." Liu's division also issued a notice, saying, "This division was ordered to be stationed in the provincial capital, which is a transfer in nature. We should be responsible for protecting the local area and express our sincere friendship to friendly troops. The military and the people should jointly maintain governance. If there are those who use rumors to confuse the public, they will be strictly investigated and dealt with leniently." As for Liu Heding himself, after arriving in the province, he paid separate visits to the various military and government leaders and Chen Jiliang. The day before yesterday evening, Lin Zhong, the brigade commander of the First Marine Corps Brigade and the provincial defense commander, accompanied Chen Jiliang to the division headquarters to return the visit. That evening, he held a banquet at the Navy Club to welcome Liu's division. After the provincial government sent people to express their condolences, Division Commander Liu, together with Chen Gang, the counselor and director of the provincial office in the province, went to the Navy Club to pay a visit to Chen, and talked for about half an hour, and briefly touched upon the provincial situation. As for Lu's division, the six people who had previously transferred Lin Zhiyuan and others to the province were placed in the arsenal and protected by troops. At 4:00 AM on the morning of the 23rd, the six people were transferred back to the upper reaches, some said to Zhugi, some said to Shuikou, and some said to be sent back to Yanping. The reasons for the transfer, according to reports, were that the protection force in the province was not strong enough. How to transfer and send them to Beijing is currently still being decided in accordance with the original plan to continue negotiations with Chen Jiliang. It is also heard that because Lin and others have been temporarily transferred to other places, the Lu's division stationed in the arsenal has also been gradually withdrawn. According to reports in recent days, Liu's division's transfer is not related to the problem of Lin and others, but the contents still need to be investigated.</p>
<h3>The Joint Suppression of Bandit He by Fujian and Zhejiang Has Stalled</h3>
<p>Eastern Fujian Counties Have Been Ravaged by Bandits</p>
<p>Fuzhou dispatch: The joint suppression of He Jinbiao's bandit gang by Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, Chen Bojie's troops of the First Battalion and Li Shuguang's troops of the Second Battalion of the 69th Regiment of the 45th Division, which had previously entered the border of Fujian from Zhejiang, had advanced to Shouning and Fu'an counties separately. Because supplies were not available, they retreated back to Zhejiang, and the joint suppression completely stalled, causing the bandit flames to flare up again. Liu Zongyi, the captain of the Second Brigade of the Provincial Police, who had been sent by the provincial government to join the Zhejiang army in the suppression, was helpless because of his isolated forces and returned to the province from Fu'an to request instructions. Bandit He then harassed Zhenghe, Pingnan, Gutian, Ningde, Xiapu, Fuding, and Luoyuan counties, and divided their forces in Shouning and Fu'an counties. According to reports, in Fuding and Zhenghe counties, the bandits have pressed the county seats, less than 20 or 30 miles away, and the defending soldiers in the city are only four platoons in one county and less than one company in the other, and there are no soldiers defending the important towns. The situation is extremely critical. The Huotong town in Ningde county was captured by bandits, and the disaster victims fled to the county seat, and the old, weak, women, and children, who were sick and tired in the middle of the road, were half starved to death. The Zheyang town in Xiapu county was also captured, and silver, money, utensils, livestock, and food were looted, with losses of no less than hundreds of thousands of yuan. More than 200 men and women were kidnapped, and hundreds of people were killed, and even women were raped and young children were killed, which was inhuman. The villages bordering Luoyuan and Gutian counties were burned and looted, and there was almost no peaceful day. The villagers were displaced and had nowhere to live, and the defense forces were weak and trapped in the county seat, unable to rescue them. In summary, the eastern Fujian counties can be said to be completely under the violence of Bandit He, but because the overall situation has not been determined, the provincial government has not been able to drive out the scattered bandits of Zhang Shouben, He En, and Niu in the northwest suburbs of the provincial capital, so it has no time to take care of the painful suppression of Bandit He.

<h3>Fan Qiwu's Report on Guangdong's Finances</h3>
<p>Military Expenses Account for More Than 4.2 Million Yuan Per Month</p>
<p>Government Expenses Account for Thirty Percent of the Provincial Treasury's Revenue</p>
<p>Various Commercial Taxes and Levies Borrowed Up to the Twenty-First Year</p>
<p>No Tax Revenue Collected in Qinlian and Gaolei for Two to Three Months</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Due to repeated military campaigns in Guangdong Province, the authorities have been making every effort to raise funds and have even delayed government expenses by a month. They are still struggling greatly because the war situation in Guangxi is still at a stalemate. Each month, Guangdong Province supplies at least 4.2 million yuan in military expenses to the front lines. If this continues, all the province's income will be used to cover these expenses, and there will still be concerns about not having enough. Other government expenses will be even more difficult to account for. Fan Qiwu, the Director of Finance, has recently felt great difficulty. Yesterday (the 24th), during the provincial government's memorial week, he gave a detailed report on the recent real situation of Guangdong's finances to make the people of Guangdong aware of the content. He stated that before the 17th year of the Republic of China, all national and provincial taxes were managed and spent by Feng Zhuwan, the former Director of the National Tax Management Committee and Director of Finance. There was no distinction between national and provincial taxes. In that year, there were no wars in the province. The special coal and oil tax and the 2.5% tax were still collected by the National Tax Management Committee. The average total monthly income of the national and provincial treasuries was 6.51 million yuan. In February of the 18th year, the special coal and oil tax and the 2.5% tax were transferred to the customs for collection and remittance to the central government. Monthly income suddenly decreased by more than 1.3 million yuan. When Minister Song came to Guangdong, he clearly divided national and provincial taxes. The budgeted monthly income for national taxes was more than 3.34 million yuan, and the budgeted monthly income for provincial taxes was more than 2.33 million yuan. However, from July of the 18th year to the end of February of the 19th year, the average actual monthly national tax revenue was only more than 2.63 million yuan, which was more than 20% less than the budgeted income. The average monthly provincial tax revenue was more than 3.84 million yuan, which was more than 60% higher than the budgeted income. The average monthly national tax revenue was only more than 2.6 million yuan, while the expenditure on military expenses alone reached more than 4.2 million yuan. In addition, the expenses for party affairs, government affairs, and education were greatly insufficient. When the national treasury was insufficient, the provincial treasury's income was allocated and borrowed. From March of the 18th year to February of the 19th year, more than 23.81 million yuan was allocated and borrowed from the provincial treasury in one year. Only 30% of the monthly income of the provincial treasury was used for local administrative, educational, judicial, and construction purposes. Most of the provincial treasury's income was pre-borrowed from merchants, such as the pawned military salaries, the expenses of various commercial platforms, the earthworm silk levies, etc., which have all been pre-borrowed up to the 21st year. Various commercial package taxes, with annual amounts of more than 50,000 yuan, have also been pre-borrowed for five months. In addition, there are pre-collected land taxes, the issuance of military treasury bonds, and the organization of Guangzhou's industrial rental. All kinds of taxes and levies are increased by 10% for military expenses. If there is a way, every effort is made to raise funds and supply military needs as much as possible, so that soldiers are well-fed and horses are strong, and the military campaign against the rebels can be concluded as soon as possible. Military expenses can be reduced to 2.5 million yuan per month as previously determined by Commander Chen, so that the people can reduce their burden, and the expenses for construction, education, and debt repayment can be spent according to the budget. Guangdong can then make progress. What I can do is only in the provincial treasury. However, the expenses for party affairs, military affairs, and government affairs, whether from the national treasury or the provincial treasury, are all my responsibility. If income does not meet expenditure, I must also raise funds. In the process of raising funds, there are many restrictive events. The most obvious is the protection fee for defense, smoking ban, that is, the so-called public reserve fund. This is already an open secret. I don't know when it will be sufficient. If we want to ban smoking, gambling, and abolish harsh and miscellaneous taxes, as long as everyone can spend one cent on one thing, and save expenses in a practical way, and do not waste or be extravagant, and each agency settles accounts and makes them public every month, I ask myself that I have exhausted my efforts, but all parties still blame me for not being able to meet their needs. I have no financial learning or experience and dare not cling to my position and delay the overall plan. I have repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to resign and telegraphed Commander Chen to recommend someone to replace me. I have verbally resigned to Chairman Chen countless times, but have not been approved. I dare to say that the expenses of the Guangdong party, government, and military are more sufficient than those of the central government and any other province. If everyone can share the difficulties together, I am not unwilling to try my best to overcome this difficult situation. However, all fundraising methods have been exhausted, local security has not been restored, and no tax revenue has been collected in Qinlian and Gaolei for two to three months. I do not know when the military affairs will end. This is why I am afraid and apprehensive and cannot help but want to make way for the more capable.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Treasury Bonds to be Repaid in Installments with Principal and Interest</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province recently issued 4 million yuan in military treasury bonds to adjust treasury funds. It is reported that the amount sold recently, about 700,000 yuan, was promoted by the General Chamber of Commerce, and more than 900,000 yuan by other counties and cities, totaling 1.67 million yuan in bond sales. To date, the originally scheduled closing date is approaching, but the amount to be promoted is still large. It is found that more than 2.7 million bonds have been issued, but only 1.67 million yuan has been actually received. Moreover, there are priorities for bond purchasers. If it ends once, it will be even more difficult to repay the principal and interest in the future. Yesterday, the Finance Department specifically stipulated measures for its subordinates to follow. The original order stated, "The deadline for the promotion and sale of military treasury bonds in various counties and cities has been extended to March 15. Now the deadline has passed. According to statistics, the amount of bonds issued is more than 2.7 million yuan, and the actual amount of money received is about 1.67 million yuan. There are still many who have not been able to raise the full amount within the deadline. Such delays will not only hinder the operation of finance, but also be unfair to the repayment of principal and interest in the future. The date of maturity for repayment of the bonds is clearly printed as June of the 19th year. There will be no distinction between priorities for future repayment of principal and interest. If there is no distinction between priorities, it will be difficult for the treasury to cope with the repayment of 4 million yuan at one time. Bond purchasers have priorities, but those who purchased later will enjoy the same repayment benefits as those who purchased earlier, which is not fair. The following measures are specifically formulated: (1) The original amount of bonds issued is 4 million yuan, and it is scheduled to be repaid after six months. It has been three months since the issuance, and the promotion has not yet reached the quota. Since there are priorities for sale, a closing date should be clearly defined and handled in two phases for future repayment. (2) All agencies should report the amount of bonds sold in two phases and remit the money. The period from the date of issuance to the end of March is the first phase, and the period from April 1 to the end of May is the second phase. The bond numbers, number of bonds, amount of bond money received and unreceived, and dates, etc., within the period should be filled in according to the form as the standard for verifying the priority of repayment. This report form must be submitted by April 10 for the first phase and by June 10 for the second phase to be valid. (3) This bond money must be remitted by the deadline to cope with the situation. If the money for the first phase has been remitted but the bond has not been received, or the money has been received but has not been remitted within the period, it will be counted as the second phase. (4) These treasury bonds will be repaid in two phases. Those issued in the first phase will be repaid with principal and interest starting from June of the 19th year, and those issued in the second phase will be repaid with principal and interest starting from September of the 19th year. The priority of the bond numbers to be repaid will be determined by the priority of the sales period reported by each agency. (5) The original deadline for each county was March 15, which is now reset to the end of March as the end of the first phase and the end of May as the end of the second phase." (March 22)</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Suppression of Bandits in the Upper Reaches of the Han River</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Communist bandits and local bandits run rampant on the border between Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, harassing everywhere and forcing good people to join the party. The people of the counties in the upper reaches of the Han River are moving to Southeast Asia in droves. According to customs statistics, the number of people going to Southeast Asia in the first half of March reached 24,000. Also, the area of Shuikou, a barracks on the border between Meixian and Fengshun, is dozens of miles long and wide, and there are no people. The fields are barren, and the altar walls are covered with reactionary slogans. The people on the border between Guangdong and Jiangxi, Xunwu and Pingyuan, are under the control of bandits and communists and are also extremely miserable. According to visitors from the Jiangxi border, people there often prepare a red and white flag each. When the soldiers come, they hang the white flag, and when the bandits come, they hang the red flag. They are frightened several times a day and often hide among the rocks, eking out a living. They sobbed as they spoke.</p>
<p>The 61st Division of Jiang Guangnai's troops was stationed in Chaozhou and Meizhou, and then received orders to enter Guangxi. Now the 8th Brigade of Mao Weishou's troops is stationed in Meixian to suppress the bandits in the upper reaches of the Han River. Deputy Division Commander Dai Ji is in Shantou in charge of military and political affairs. However, because there are few soldiers, the bandits are still not quelled. The bandits in the upper reaches of the Mei River in Meixian blocked the river and robbed rice. On March 9, they were defeated by the garrison troops in Shekeng, Changsha. On the 10th, the army again recovered more than 100 dan of rice near Xintang. On the 13th, Tian Guozhang, the second battalion of the 15th regiment stationed in Shekeng, sent the 7th company to Zhangshantang to fight bandits. They encountered more than 100 bandits and fought for half an hour. The bandits were scattered and fled up the mountain. In this battle, 40 bandits were killed and 3 communist bandits, Li Yasheng, Liao Kunshan, and Liu Fadai, were captured. On the 14th, they were escorted back to Shekeng and executed on the spot. Also, Chen Rongguang, the chief of the Fengshi Public Security Bureau, has recently sent troops to Taoyuan and Huangsha in Meixian to suppress bandits. He arrested more than 30 suspects, several of whom were definitely communist bandits, and executed them in front of the Tianhou Palace. Also, Liu Shuisheng, the bandit leader of Taipingbao in Meixian, the former captain of the Red Guards of the Communist Bandits in Meixi, had killed several good people in the fort, Ling Yama and Wu Jinfeng. Recently, because the 8th Brigade was stationed in Mei to suppress bandits, Liu sneaked into Shantou on the 17th, intending to go to Southeast Asia. He was discovered by Gu Tongjin and Huang Fuan, residents of the fort, who notified the first district police station to arrest Liu, who was detained in the Public Security Bureau pending trial.

<h3>A Glimpse of Gao'an, Jiangxi Province, After its Capture</h3>
<p>Recaptured by the Police Brigade</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence on the 26th: Peng Huang's group of communist bandits in Jiangxi, due to a conflict in Suichuan when they were reorganized by Zhu Mao, the remnants fled back to Yifeng and Wanzai in western Jiangxi, raising the banner of anti-communism and anti-Zhu Mao, and calling for support for Yan Xishan. This</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>is also a speculative act by bandits. After the Peng Huang bandits occupied Yifeng, the neighboring counties of Fengxin and Gaoan simultaneously reported being in danger. On the 21st of this month, a small part of the group, about several hundred people with more than one hundred guns, attacked Gaoan again, and on the 22nd, they captured the city of Gaoan. The police team was disarmed, and the county magistrate fled. After the bandits entered the city, they burned the county government, party headquarters, and various government offices, and extorted 80,000 yuan from the business community, requiring the money to be handed over by 6 p.m., otherwise the city would be slaughtered. The merchants and civilians received the news and fled to the province to ask for help. On the 23rd, the Provincial General Chamber of Commerce also received a telegram from the Gaoan Chamber of Commerce stating, "To the Gaoan Fellow Villagers Association, our county has been captured by bandits, and the county government and other buildings have been burned down. The situation is extremely urgent, and the number of bandits has not yet been verified. We implore you to petition the provincial government and send a team to come to our aid overnight. We await your orders with great anticipation, the Gaoan County Chamber of Commerce." The distance between the provincial capital and Gaoan Fengxin is only a few dozen miles, so the rumors were very prevalent, like a bow reflected in a cup. Chairman Lu immediately sent Secretary-General Yang Mianzhong to announce to the business community, stating, "The troops in this city are more than one regiment, and Tang's brigade has also transferred a part to station in Zhangshu. The rear security is extremely solid, and there is no other concern." The merchants and civilians were slightly relieved. At the same time, Lu ordered the police brigade and the second security team of the Public Security Bureau to set out from the province on the evening of the 24th to suppress the bandits in Gaoan. When they arrived on the 25th, the bandits had already fled far away, and order was restored. Now, the provincial government, considering that ships coming and going from the Gan River are often shot at by bandits, hindering transportation, specially sent the "Minzu" shallow-water warship to station in Xiajiang, and the "Xunyang" warship recently came from the bay to the province and stationed outside the Zhangjiangmen riverbank, to provide deterrence.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zongchang Privately Gave Official Property to Russians</h3>
<p>The Qingdao Municipal Government Has Implemented the Recovery</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Zhang Zongchang, the traitor, privately gave two pieces of official property in Qingdao to the Russians Miroff and Niegaff. After the Municipal Handling of Traitor Property Committee found out, it sent a letter requesting the municipal government to recover them. The municipal government has now sent personnel to investigate and found out that Zhang Zongchang did give each of the two Russians one piece of official property because they had followed him for many years and had done some minor services. This kind of illegal transfer is invalid and has ordered the Public Security Bureau to notify Miroff and Niegaff to vacate the houses within ten days to restore the public property. The Public Security Bureau delivered the notice on the 23rd, and Miroff and Niegaff have accepted it. The furniture and other items will be counted by Yao Suizhi of the municipal government together with the Public Security Bureau and guarded by the police. The original text of the Public Security Bureau's notice is excerpted below to show the truth of the case: "Regarding the case of the official property at No. 4 Wendeng Road in this city, the Qingdao Special Municipality Handling of Traitor Property Committee issued a letter stating that the municipal government has repeatedly ordered investigation and handling. We have ordered investigators to report that Zhang Zongchang, the traitor, did give it to the Russian Miroff to live in. We have reported the findings and requested its recovery. Also, according to the former Commercial Bureau's report to the former Shandong Governor, in addition to the Miroff case, there is also the case of giving Russian Niegaff official property at No. 173 Fushan Road at the same time. The situation is exactly the same as the Miroff case. The sale of official property must be announced for bidding to be legal. Zhang Zongchang, taking advantage of his warlord status, regarded public property as private property for the purpose of rewarding his cronies. This kind of illegal transfer is invalid, and Zhang Zongchang is full of crimes and has been clearly wanted by the National Government. The Russians Miroff and Niegaff are all traitors and cannot be allowed to occupy the official property for a long time. We should order your bureau to order the police to expel Miroff and Niegaff from the houses and recover all the properties at those two locations to restore the public property. In addition to ordering the first sub-bureau to execute the recovery separately, we hereby instruct you to comply and vacate the house within ten days of the arrival of this letter and hand it over to the sub-bureau in charge. Do not delay." (March 25)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Quick News</h3>
<p>Tuqiao Town, which belongs to Wuwei County upstream of Wuhu, is located on the Yangtze River and has convenient transportation and prosperous commerce. Unexpectedly, around 10 o'clock the night before last, a large group of bandits, about sixty or seventy people, suddenly entered the market with weapons. They first surrounded the town's militia, and the militia captain Fang Jingfu was shot and killed by the bandits. In addition, three militiamen were killed in action and four or five were seriously injured. Dozens of rifles and pistols were robbed. Later, a detachment of the town's militia arrived to attack, and three bandits were captured. The bandits began to retreat towards Hujia溝. The captured bandits have been sent to the Wuwei County Government for legal action. It is reported that after the bandits arrived at Hujia溝, they robbed three militia rifles and two pistols. Although the merchants and civilians in Tuqiao have not suffered losses, they are extremely panicked at the news that the bandits may return.</p>
<p>The price of rice here is rising daily, and it has reached 15 yuan per stone. The livelihood of the poor is extremely difficult. The municipal and county party departments, the municipal government office, the public security bureau, and the county government held a meeting at the county party department today to discuss relief measures. It was decided to organize a Wuhu People's Food Maintenance Association, with eleven agencies, including the party and government, as members, divided into three departments: general affairs, investigation, and economy. The association's address is in the General Chamber of Commerce, and it will first start investigating the stock of rice in order to determine the price control measures.</p>
<p>The General Headquarters sent Ding Runsheng and others to Wuhu to purchase military rice. Because too much commercial rice is leaving here, and the price is soaring, the Anhui Provincial Government and the Wuhu Customs Supervisory Office were notified by telegram, instructing them to temporarily ban the export of commercial rice during the military rice purchase period to ensure the food supply for the military. Yesterday, the Customs Office has forwarded a letter to the General Chamber of Commerce to comply with.</p>
<p>The Wuhu Municipal Government Office opened a wharf tax, which is levied on goods imported and exported at the Hai and Chang Customs. It has been ordered by the provincial government by telegram to start collecting the tax on April 1. The municipal government office has now set up an office at each of the Hai and Chang Customs, and announced to the merchants and civilians to comply. However, the rice industry groups from Guangdong and Chaozhou are still opposing it. (March 27)</p>
<h3>The Russian War Losses of the Zhala Coal Mine</h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: During last year's Sino-Russian war, Manzhouli and Zhalainuoer fell one after another. After the Red Army entered, they ravaged the area. It is painful to talk about the tragedy of being robbed. In particular, the losses of the Zhalainuoer Coal Mine (hereinafter referred to as the Zhala Mine) were the greatest. The Red Army in Manzhouli withdrew on January 2 this year, and the Red Army in Zhalainuoer withdrew on December 24 last year. It is said that the reason why the Red Army tried its best to destroy the Zhala Mine was to cut off the coal source for our country's Northeast Railway and the Heilongjiang Railway, hoping to import Soviet Russian coal and make huge profits. Therefore, we should urgently seek restoration to resist them. Now, the war losses of the Zhala Mine and the future restoration plan are described as follows based on the investigation.</p>
<p>The war losses of the Zhala Mine are estimated to be more than 2 million gold rubles (each gold ruble is equivalent to about 1.56 yuan of our national currency). All the machines in the machine office were dismantled, the houses were destroyed by artillery fire, and all the accounting offices were burned down. All the items in the fire warehouse were taken away by the Red Army. Most of the machines in the electric light factory were also taken away. The boiler, coal hoisting machine room, and machines of the No. 9 coal hole were all damaged. The coal hoisting frame was completely burned. The water pump in the hole, the lower sand wellhead, the lower wooden hole mouth, the new hole mouth, and the official houses and barracks newly built north of the road were all burned down. In addition, two rooms of the clubhouse were blown up, the items in the general warehouse, the wood in the board factory, the railway poles, electric wires, and deposits in the mine, as well as furniture, were all swept away by the Red Army. The elevators were blown up, and the telephones were burned. The horses, cars, and carriages were also taken away. In short, all the movable properties in the mining area were taken away by the Red Army, and the losses of immovable properties were even greater. This change was too deeply traumatizing, and it would take a lot of effort to restore the old appearance.</p>
<p>After the Red Army occupied Zhalainuoer and destroyed the mining area, they set up a political investigation bureau there to search for White Party members and people who opposed the Soviet Union. More than 200 White Russian and Chinese workers at the Zhala Mine are missing. Some were arrested and sent to Russia, and some fled elsewhere. Some of the Red Party workers expressed their willingness to return to their country with the Red Army. It is difficult to clarify this situation until all the prisoners are completely released. Furthermore, after the Zhala Mine was destroyed by the Red Army and stopped working, there was a severe shortage of local fuel. The Red Army once hired workers to mine open-pit coal and transported away more than 150 cars. This is another obvious loss for the Zhala Mine.</p>
<p>The Zhala Mine has a vast mining area and abundant production. The fuel in various parts of the Northeast is mostly reliant on it, so we should try our best to restore it, to consolidate the economy of the Chinese Eastern Railway and to settle a large number of unemployed workers. It is reported that Guo Chongxi, the Chinese Director of the Eastern Railway Bureau, has ordered the materials department to prepare a restoration plan and is consulting on specific measures, roughly as follows:</p>
<p>The Zhala Mine was shut down on November 16 last year due to the impact of the war. According to the 1929 coal mining plan, 174,000 tons were mined last year, and 26,000 tons were not mined. There are about 1,000,000 tons of unmined coal in the No. 9 hole, but the No. 9 coal hole was completely destroyed by the Red Army, so it is very expensive to operate. However, according to the decision of the Eastern Railway Bureau's meeting on March 7, 1929, the work in the No. 9 coal hole should be completely stopped in 1932 (i.e. the year after next) to expand the open-pit coal ditches to avoid the danger of collapse. In this way, the No. 9 coal hole cannot be restored temporarily. There are many areas in the mining area's open-pit coal ditch that produce coal, and the existing and ready-to-mine coal include (1) 60,000 tons of existing coal in the new coal mine (enough for the entire Eastern Railway for three years) (2) 2,000,000 tons of pre-mined coal in the new coal ditch area (enough for the entire Eastern Railway for ten years) (3) The first coal production area, about 40 meters deep, can produce 30,000,000 tons of coal (enough for the entire Eastern Railway for 150 years). Also, the planeness there is about 23 meters deep and can produce 5,000,000 tons of coal (enough for the entire Eastern Railway for 25 years). The Eastern Railway needs 220,000 tons of coal per year. The restoration plan should first solve two key points: (a) whether to continue working in the No. 9 hole (b) The new coal ditch can produce 60,000 tons of coal this year, 220,000 tons of coal next year, and 220,000 tons of coal the year after next. We must start working on it in the shortest possible time. In this way, we can mine 20 cars of coal per day in September, 25 cars of coal per day in October, and 30 cars of coal per day in November and December. If we want to resume coal mining work this year, we must temporarily allocate the following funds: (1) Setting up a water pump, two central water separators, two electric rollers, two electric motors, and repairing houses in the new coal ditch requires about 4,489,513 gold rubles (2) Repairing the machine shop, setting up machine tools and equipment, and applying tools requires about 4,094,045 gold rubles (3) The equipment of the electric light factory should purchase two generators, three electric rollers, and repair the houses of the electric motor factory, costing about 26,646,077 gold rubles (4) Preparing fire fighting equipment requires about 290,550 gold rubles (5) Setting up horse fences and purchasing bedding requires about 207,500 gold rubles (6) Repairing the bathhouse requires about 250,000 gold rubles (7) Cleaning up the remaining old machine parts, weighing 500 tons, requires about 1,000,000 gold rubles (8) Employee replenishment costs about 5,000 gold rubles (9) Repairing public houses costs about 39,000 gold rubles (10) Laying the road line in the coal production area, 10 kilometers long, requires about 70,000 gold rubles (11) The cost of exploring and mining the mine line is about 30,000 gold rubles (12) Repairing various public items and tools, measuring instruments, a technical library, and surveying and mapping materials requires about 16,550 gold rubles (13) Setting up a telephone transfer machine and a 30-line telephone trunk line requires about 348,200 gold rubles. According to the statistics of the above items, the total cost is about 53,380,885 gold rubles.</p>
<p>Guo Chongxi, the Chinese Director of the Eastern Railway, is determined to implement the restoration of the Zhala Mine in the shortest possible time. As for the above restoration plan, he plans to consult experts once again before submitting it to the Eastern Railway Bureau meeting to decide everything. However, if we recall, the losses caused by the Red Army's robbery in various places along the border during last year's Sino-Russian war are countless. Even just looking at the Zhala Mine, it amounted to more than 2 million. This year, we are planning to restore it, and we need such a huge amount of money. The source of this huge amount of money is still from the Chinese Eastern Railway. In other words, it will add to the burden of the people of the Northeast again. (March 19)</p>

<p>The Issue of Relocating the Railway Freight Depot: Director Sun of the Wuxi Municipal Preparatory Office, considering the existing railway freight depot barges in the town were causing river congestion, had surveyed a location and proposed relocating the freight depot to Wuqiao. He drafted a plan and submitted it to the Ministry of Railways, requesting it to order the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration to send personnel from the traffic and engineering departments to jointly inspect. It was determined that relocating the freight station near Wuqiao would present significant obstacles in terms of engineering. The inspection results were reported to the Railway Administration, and it was requested that a letter be sent to the Municipal Preparatory Office and the County Chamber of Commerce, asking them to jointly send representatives to the Administration to discuss solutions that would facilitate the project. Yesterday, the Municipal Preparatory Office and the County Chamber of Commerce received this letter from the Railway Administration and promptly dispatched representatives to Shanghai to confer.</p>

Currently, the town’s Bureau of Construction has dispatched personnel to mark the center line. Construction is planned to commence within April. However, landowners along the eastern section object, citing the obligation to provide labor and the lack of an adequate compensation plan for the land. Hua Yingtong, assistant officer of the Tenth District and concurrently the head of Dongting Town, raised the issue at the fourth district affairs meeting. It was resolved that the district should petition the county government to consult with the Bureau of Construction and request approval from the Construction Department to finalize land compensation and a subsidy for labor expenses before the Wuxi-Changzhou provincial road project begins.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Bureau Chief Goes to Provincial Capital to Discuss River Dredging and Road Construction: Zhuang Zhongxi, Director of the Wujin Bureau of Construction, went to the provincial capital on the 27th to meet with the new Department Head, Sun Hongzhe, to discuss all matters related to river dredging and road construction. He returned to Changzhou on the 28th. It is reported that the following decisions were made regarding road construction: (1) Department Head Sun still advocates implementing labor conscription to complete the provincial roads first. The provincial roads passing through Wujin are the Ning-Chang (Changshu) Road to the south and the Ning-Hu (Shanghai) Road to the north. The Ning-Chang Road passes through Caoqiao and Panjiaqiao in Wujin, while the Ning-Hu Road passes through Xutang, Weicun, Xiaohe, and Menghe in Wujin. The Wuxi-Yixing section of the Ning-Chang Road has already been surveyed. Department Head Sun instructed Director Zhuang to work with the directors of the Wuxi and Yixing Construction Bureaus to commence construction this spring. (2) The Wujin-Huai'an county road is divided into ten routes. Construction on the Wu-Dan Road has already begun, and preparations for the Tong-Jiang Road are underway. The Wu-Xi Road is also planned for completion. The Cheng-He Road has been surveyed and also requires labor conscription. (3) To ensure the connection between the provincial and county roads, the Wu-Dan Road will be built to Bencheng this year, connecting to the Tong-Jiang Road to link with the Ning-Hu Road. The Wu-Xi Road will extend to Qishuyan, connecting to the Qi-He section of the Cheng-He Road, which connects to Caoqiao and the Wuxi-Yixing section of the Ning-Chang Road. (4) Laborers should be treated favorably and allowed to use a portion of the compensation. The collection of compensation will be the responsibility of the county government. (5) Public compensation will be given for the occupation of private land. If funds are temporarily insufficient, they will be paid in installments. (6) Earthwork will be completed section by section, culverts will be laid as needed, and bridges will be started simultaneously. Regarding river dredging: (1) The West Guan River section requires a loan of 3,000 yuan from the transport industry and 3,000 yuan from the Bureau of Construction, but approval has not yet been received. Department Head Sun agreed to approve the loan to facilitate the project. (2) Dredging the canal with provincial funds was previously approved, and the new provincial government departments will naturally continue to support it. The county bureau has been instructed to work with the Chamber of Commerce to develop a detailed plan. Provincial, county, and merchant funds should be allocated simultaneously, designated for storage, and not used for other purposes to allow for withdrawal when construction begins. Director Zhuang immediately went to Wuxi to discuss the Wuxi-Yixing Road project with the directors of the Wuxi and Yixing bureaus.

<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Aftermath of the Liuhang People's Uprising: Following the Liuhang people's uprising in Dinghai, public morale was greatly shaken. The county government, recognizing the plight of the bereaved families, allocated funds for relief efforts and strictly pursued the ringleaders while prohibiting revenge and extortion. However, due to the severity of the disaster and the deep-seated resentment, incidents of illegal retaliation were unavoidable. Furthermore, unscrupulous individuals exploited the situation for personal gain, engaging in extortion and blackmail. As a result, the government convened gentry from both the city and countryside to form the Liuhang Tragedy Aftermath Association, inviting representatives from the Ningbo Shanghai Native Place Association and the Dinghai Shanghai Native Place Association to participate, with the aim of resolving all post-incident issues. It is reported that the association will be established soon.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from Jiangsu Provincial Huaian Middle School</h3>
<p>Having read the article titled "Recent News on Student Unrest in Two Provincial Schools" in the Qingjiang correspondence section of your newspaper on March 24th, we found the information regarding class attendance at Huaian Middle School to be inaccurate. The handover between the old and new principals of our school occurred on March 19th, and classes resumed as usual on the 20th. The courses of all teachers who had improperly resigned were immediately filled by replacements. The statement in your newspaper that "classes were prepared to resume today (the 20th), but it was still ineffective" is likely based on hearsay spread by someone with ulterior motives. We hereby send this letter to request a correction. Jiangsu Provincial Huaian Middle School, March 26th.</p>

<h3>Lehua and Western Police Fiercely Tied</h3>
<p>The score was three to three... No winner after 30 minutes of extra time.</p>
<p>Scott Cup Replay... They will have to determine the victor another day.</p>
<p>In this year's four cup competitions organized by the Shanghai Westerners Football Association, apart from the Nations Cup, which was won by China, the Group A Championship and Senior Cup have both been won by Whites-Piston. Only the Scott Cup remains, and Lehua team has the hope of winning it. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Lehua and Western Police played the replay at the Chinese Baseball Field. The outcome of the game could indicate who would win the championship. The result was that both sides scored three goals, and no winner could be decided. Therefore, thirty minutes of extra time was added to determine the final winner, but still no goals were scored, and the game ended in a draw. A rematch will be held on another day. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Western Police's Formation is Better Than Before</p>
<p>Yesterday, Lehua team had Chen Guangyao, a famous left-winger from South China, joining the battle. The expectation beforehand was that Lehua could certainly win. However, Western Police's formation yesterday was greatly adjusted. For example, center-back Xu and full-back Turner were both reassigned as forwards, and the strength in the rear was not diminished. On the contrary, the inside and outside were consolidated, and the combat strength was strengthened. Lehua's left-winger Chen Guangyao ran fast and passed the ball well, which was invaluable. However, from the second half onwards, he was unable to fully develop due to a foot injury, which was a pity. Players such as Dai Linjing, Chen Yutian, and Xi Qiaosheng lacked brilliance, and even Li Huitang was only so-so. Apart from Sun Sijing, the center-back line was mediocre. Full-back Jiang Shanjing had extraordinary courage and was very confident in intercepting the ball, which could be said to be a rising talent.</p>
<p>(2) Western Police Scores Early in the Game</p>
<p>Not long after the start of the game, Western Police scored a goal against Lehua first. Afterwards, Lehua launched a desperate counterattack and also scored a goal. Then, they scored another goal. This goal was the most spectacular. The two sides fought fiercely, and the situation was urgent. Lehua's five forwards surrounded the Western Police's goal from all sides, so Western Police was never able to kick the ball out. Finally, Xi Qiaosheng of Lehua shot the ball back into the goal, earning a lot of applause. In the second half, Western Police scored a goal first, making it two goals each. Soon after, Lehua took the lead again with a score of three to two. Afterwards, Western Police launched a fierce attack. Zhou Xianyan ran out to save the ball, leaving the goal empty. Jiang Shanjing retreated to guard the goal. Unexpectedly, a ball flew over, and Jiang was unable to stop it. He had to use his hand to catch it, and was penalized with a penalty kick, which was kicked in by Western Police's De Fei, making the score a tie of three to three. Both sides performed very well, and the outcome was secondary.</p>
<p>(3) Lehua's Talented Players Missed Opportunities Repeatedly</p>
<p>In the line-up, Western Police kicked the ball to attack Lehua, coming fiercely. Lehua defended on all sides, and Chen Guangyao retreated to assist in the battle. Li Ning intercepted the ball and kicked it out. Li Huitang and Chen Guangyao launched an attack together. Chen received the ball from Huitang and went deep into the enemy's camp alone. At a suitable location, he passed the ball to the front of the Western Police's goal. Dai Linjing's shot was too high, and the opportunity was lost. After maneuvering for a while, Lehua advanced from the right wing. Chen Yutian broke through and advanced to the side of the Western Police's goal and passed the ball to the left. Chen Guangyao caught up and shot, but the ball went out of bounds to the right. Subsequently, Xi Qiaosheng also missed a great opportunity, which was truly unfortunate for Lehua.</p>
<p>(4) Western Police Scores a Goal with a Header</p>
<p>Western Police repeatedly encountered difficulties, but was able to survive them, and their morale was greatly boosted. They then led their troops to chase and kill, in a mighty manner. Lehua was panicked and retreated to defend. However, the Western Police forwards Xu and Turner came fiercely, connecting with five forwards to attack Lehua's goal. Lehua was trapped in a situation of being surrounded. Right inside forward Daviel saw Xu lifting a high ball and used his head to head the ball into the goal. Zhou Xianyan jumped up to block it, but was unable to reach it, and the ball fell into the goal. Lehua then lost a goal, less than ten minutes into the game.</p>
<p>(5) Western Police's Ball Possession Became More Smooth</p>
<p>Western Police's ball possession became smoother, and the danger in front of Lehua's goal did not diminish. Fortunately, they defended well and did not suffer a loss. They then led a covert attack. Chen Yutian passed the ball to the front of the Western Police's goal. Li Huitang intercepted it, but due to the unfavorable position, he passed it to Chen Guangyao again. Chen lifted his foot to shoot, and the ball was fast and accurate. Western Police's goalkeeper Bratt was quick and agile, and pushed the ball out of the back. This truly showed his skill. Everyone praised Chen Guangyao's subsequent corner kick. Although the landing point was good, it was eventually saved.</p>
<p>(6) Lehua Retaliates and Western Police is in Danger</p>
<p>Both sides, recognizing the importance of this battle, were determined to win. Therefore, the battle was always tense, without the slightest relaxation. Moreover, at this time, Lehua had already lost a goal, and it was inevitable that they would launch a counterattack with the intention of retaliating. However, Western Police was unwilling to show weakness, and confronted each other without yielding. The forwards launched an aggressive attack, and the defenders were heavily guarded. The situation was unpredictable. Suddenly, Western Police launched an attack, and Lehua was attacked. Suddenly, Lehua counterattacked, and Western Police was in danger. The audience cheered, wave after wave. The excitement was such that one could only sigh in admiration.</p>
<p>(7) Li and Xi Each Score a Goal and Perform Miracles</p>
<p>Lehua launched a desperate attack, trying to win. After a long and bitter battle, Li Huitang finally scored a goal. This goal was due to Chen Guangyao. As a result, the military appearance was greatly enhanced and the momentum was magnificent. Huitang and Guangyao, the two generals, engaged in close combat and moved forward with the ball. Li crossed from the left corner, and the ball brushed against the Western Police's goal, heading straight for the right. Chen Yutian shot hard, and the ball brushed against the goal again, heading to the left. Western Police saw that the situation was not good and guarded tightly. Lehua's forwards surrounded the Western Police's goal and shot fiercely. One foot, another foot, Western Police blocked left and right. Only the sound of the ball banging could be heard, as if one were in a battlefield. Amidst this chaotic battle, suddenly the sound of cheers was heard, like a spring thunder. Xi Qiaosheng had performed a miracle. Lehua surpassed with a score of two to zero, ending the first half.</p>
<p>(8) Western Police Scores Another Goal to Tie</p>
<p>The battle started again. Western Police took the initiative, with the aim of gaining the upper hand, like a hungry tiger pouncing on its prey, brave and extraordinary. In front of Lehua's goal, everywhere were blue eyes and yellow hair. The sound of the ball was like a string of firecrackers, shooting continuously. Zhou Xianyan was in the midst of the artillery fire and found it difficult to parry. Fortunately, Jiang Shanjing, Sun Sijing, Li Ning, etc., defended well and turned danger into safety. However, Western Police had sufficient troops, and as soon as one wave retreated, another wave rose. The danger within Lehua's area did not diminish. After a long battle, the left inside forward Turner finally scored a goal, making the score a tie of two to two.</p>
<p>(9) Lehua Unluckily Penalized with a Penalty Kick</p>
<p>Opening the ball in the center, Lehua went straight to the Yellow Dragon. Chen Guangyao used a high ball to send the ball into the field. Li Huitang rushed forward to intercept it, launched a solo attack, and went deep into the enemy's camp. Western Police full-back Huogengsheng followed Li behind, intending to block him. When he reached the front of the goal, Li Huitang turned around, and the ball had already left his foot and flew into the Western Police's goal. Lehua then took the lead again with a score of three to two. However, the sky has unpredictable winds and clouds, and people have misfortunes that occur overnight. Glory had just been announced, and Western Police followed in pursuit. Center Xu took the ball and rushed up. Zhou Xianyan ran out, intending to resolve the crisis. Unexpectedly, the timing was not right. Jiang Shanjing saw that the goal was empty, so he sat and guarded the goal. Suddenly, there was a loud bang. Xu had already shot the ball into the goal. Jiang saw that the situation was not good, but there was no way to escape. He had no choice but to use his hand to catch it, and was penalized with a penalty kick, which was kicked in by Western Police's center-back De Fei, making the score a tie of three to three again.</p>
<p>(10) No Winner After 30 Minutes of Extra Time</p>
<p>After that, they competed with each other, but neither side made any achievements. It was announced that the time was up, but the winner had not been determined. Therefore, thirty minutes of extra time were added to determine the final winner, but no one gained anything, and the game ended in a draw. The right to play in the Scott Cup final is still uncertain. We will have to see their good skills later.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Chen Dezheng delivered the opening address, saying: "Representatives from all walks of life, comrades, at 1:00 PM on this day nineteen years ago, the seventy-two martyrs buried in Yellow Flower Mound began their work of sacrificing themselves for the country. The origin of the magnificent and glorious fact of that martyrdom was as follows: In 1911, the New Army in Guangzhou failed, and Sun Yat-sen lost many of his loyal followers, but the work of revolution became increasingly urgent. Many comrades, the elite of the revolutionary parties from various provinces, gathered in Guangzhou. The plan at that time was to recover Guangzhou first, and then have Comrade Huang Kecheng lead a force to attack Hunan directly from Guangzhou, while another route would be organized by other comrades to advance towards Jiangxi. Everyone would converge in the Central Plains. Because the situation at that time was such that only after Guangzhou was recovered and the revolutionary forces had a solid base in the rear could they advance towards the Central Plains, occupy Nanjing, peer into the Central Plains, and sweep away the lair of the Aisin Gioro clan in the north. Therefore, the city of Guangzhou became our destination. This plan was decided by Sun Yat-sen, and three important agencies were established in Hong Kong to actively carry it out. Overseas Chinese in the Nanyang Islands, inspired by Sun Yat-sen's call, devoted much effort to helping the revolution, resulting in a formidable momentum. At that time, the dim-witted and confused Qing government was awakened from its slumber and realized that the launching of this revolutionary force was like an arrow on the string. They knew that if this force were to erupt, it would be impossible to resist. Therefore, they directed their ministers and slaves to intensify their suppression. By March 25th, countless preparations for the uprising, uprising plans, and uprising agencies had suffered much oppression. At that time, in a state of unbearable suffering, the revolutionary patriots had no choice but to rise up quickly. Because if everyone were to delay further, waiting for those Qing ministers and slaves to strengthen their defenses for a longer time, it would certainly be even more difficult to recover Guangzhou. At the same time, our martyrs also received news of successful liaison with the Guangzhou Garrison. Therefore, on this day nineteen years ago, the decision was made to begin this world-shaking, Qing government-astounding, magnificent, and brilliantly shining uprising. Unfortunately, due to the disparity in numbers and the great oppressive force set up by the Qing in Guangzhou, the result was a disastrous defeat. As a result of this disastrous defeat, some comrades fled, some were arrested, and some were martyred. In total, seventy-two patriots sacrificed themselves in this campaign. The comrades who fled were finally able to continue their struggle, drive out the Tartars, and preserve the revolutionary cause and this glory until now. As for those comrades who sacrificed themselves, their bodies were not buried together on Yellow Flower Mound by a comrade until April 5th. This is the tomb of the seventy-two martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound, which now stands tall outside Guangzhou and is worshipped and admired by all generations. Because of this tragic March 29th Incident, not only did it arouse the boiling blood of revolutionary people throughout the country, but it also attracted worldwide attention to Sun Yat-sen's struggle to lead the revolution. On October 10th of the same year, the Wuchang Uprising broke out, thus overthrowing the Aisin Gioro clan's more than 260 years of autocratic rule and regaining the freedom of our entire Chinese nation. This tragic, passionate, and glorious history is forever worthy of our commemoration, admiration, and worship, forever stirring our emotions and forever making our blood boil. Now, at a time when the country is unstable and the national atmosphere is gradually degenerating to the lowest level, we come to listen again to the tragic history of the seventy-two martyrs who died for their country, to recall the unfinished legacy and instructions left by the seventy-two martyrs. We must not only grieve, but also be indignant. We deeply recognize that the necessary conditions for the seventy-two martyrs to achieve this great sacrifice can be summarized in three points that can be put forward. First, the seventy-two martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound had a central belief. What is our central belief? It is that everyone believes without a doubt that the Three Principles of the People are indeed the only way to save China, that Sun Yat-sen is indeed the guide of the revolution, and that the revolution initiated by Sun Yat-sen will surely be successfully realized. Because of this firm belief, a great force was generated, creating this glorious and brilliant March 29th Incident, admired by all ages. Second, the seventy-two martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound were not all three-headed and six-armed; they were all like us, young people in their twenties and thirties, and middle-aged people in their forties. What distinguished them from ordinary people was their ability to maintain the righteous spirit between heaven and earth, with each person having a sense of honor and each person respecting integrity. Relying on this righteous spirit between heaven and earth and integrity and honor, they sacrificed for the nation and fought for the nation, causing the Qing government to lose its courage and causing the whole world, all those who sympathized with the revolution, to pay close attention. Third, the martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound had the courage to face knives, saws, axes, and blades without fear, and the determination to sacrifice for the public without hesitation. This spirit aroused the revolutionary sentiments of the people throughout the country and promoted the Wuchang Uprising. Even today, we still benefit greatly from their grace. The seventy-two martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound possessed these several great spirits, so naturally anything could be accomplished. Recalling the intentions of the martyrs at that time, they wanted to overthrow the Qing government first, then resist foreign invaders, and then overthrow all imperialism. Their great aspirations truly make us admire them to this day. Having such great aspirations and possessing such great spirits, although they could not personally witness the demise of the Qing government, they were ultimately able to realize the success of the Xinhai Revolution in the shortest possible time, to comfort the spirits of the seventy-two martyrs in heaven. Hearing the tragic history of the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs, and thinking of the warlords at the end of their road harming the country and the shameless literati sliding into depravity, in addition to our grief, we cannot help but raise a few points to encourage ourselves and others. The first point we must encourage ourselves with is that we must each possess a central belief like that possessed by the seventy-two martyrs. Everyone knows what our central belief is: Sun Yat-sen's legacy. We must take Sun Yat-sen's legacy as the norm for our actions, the goal of our efforts, and expand it to enable the people throughout the country to do the same. If anyone comes to trample on Sun Yat-sen's legacy, if anyone comes to undermine this central belief, then they are our great enemy. We must rise up and extinguish this great enemy who tramples on Sun Yat-sen's legacy and undermines the central belief. We firmly believe that adhering to Sun Yat-sen's legacy is today's only central belief. We cannot leave this central belief for a moment. The second point, the righteous spirit and honor and integrity maintained by the seventy-two martyrs are really very important and really worthy of treasure. We want to make the righteous spirit between heaven and earth live forever. We want to forever promote and magnify the tragic and glorious righteous deeds of the seventy-two martyrs. We know that there are many people now who attack the government because they themselves have no power to wield. They attack the government because they themselves have no opportunity to indulge their selfish desires. We must eliminate these shameless scoundrels who have lost their personality and abandoned righteousness. We firmly believe that if we allow the lives of these shameless people to be prolonged, our nation and country will surely follow the same fate as Korea, India, and Annam. To preserve the survival of the nation and the life of the country, we can only use our full strength to preserve and promote this righteous spirit between heaven and earth. We must take the glory of the nation as our glory. We must not destroy the glory of the nation for our personal selfish desires. We must also overthrow those shameless scoundrels who destroy the glory of the nation for their personal selfish desires. The third point, we must have a spirit of striving for the public good and sacrificing ourselves. Everything about the individual is not a problem. The individual's life, wealth, life, wisdom, etc., must all be used for the country, for the nation, and for mankind. We must have a spirit of sacrificing ourselves for the public good. This spirit was concretely demonstrated to us by the seventy-two martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound with the March 29th Incident, giving us an example to follow. We should continue their spirit and fight for freedom for the nation. There are many reactionary elements who are causing trouble for personal gain. We must muster our courage and, with our spirit of sacrificing ourselves for the public good, extinguish them. We can only continue the spirit of the seventy-two martyrs and fight to the death against all those who undermine national peace and unification and disregard the survival of the nation. Fourth, we must have the great aspirations possessed by the seventy-two martyrs. In China today, there are warlords who are inherently treacherous, literati who are ideologically backward, and politicians who love to cause trouble. In addition to these, there are also rampant forces formed by feudal ideology and imperialism. These are all the enemies of the national revolution. When Sun Yat-sen was alive, we could follow Sun Yat-sen and act according to Sun Yat-sen's guidance. Now that Sun Yat-sen is dead, we can only follow Sun Yat-sen's legacy, gather under the banner of the Kuomintang, and, under the leadership of the Party, complete the great aspirations that the seventy-two martyrs did not complete and the national revolution that everyone hopes to succeed. Today, in an atmosphere of sorrow, grief, and tension, I especially put forward these ideas to share with you, to encourage each other. Know that revolution is not superficial; revolution must first revolutionize the heart. We should all make such a determination to achieve our future great revolutionary cause." End of the speech.</p>
<p>Representative Speeches: Mayor Zhang Yuejun and Municipal Executive Committee Member Pan Gongzhan both gave sorrowful speeches, recorded as follows: "Mayor Zhang's Speech": "Comrades, today we are all here to participate in the commemoration of the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound. At this time, our hearts are filled with respect and admiration, and at the same time, we feel very sad and mournful. Just now, the chairman said that in commemorating the seventy-two martyrs, we must continue their legacy and fulfill their beliefs. We know that the reason why the martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound were able to sacrifice themselves for the country was based on their central belief. This central belief is Sun Yat-sen's legacy and the Party's doctrine. With this central belief, we can complete the National Revolution and the construction needed by the people. Therefore, this central belief is also the central belief of the people throughout the country. I would like to add that we must build and consolidate this central belief so that the people throughout the country can all work together under this central belief. There must be many sacrifices from those who are wise and insightful. Of course, many people do not understand Sun Yat-sen's legacy. Many people must understand Sun Yat-sen's doctrine, and there must be great bloodshed to move them. Therefore, the sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound blossomed into the flower of doctrine. For example, Mr. Chen Ying-shi of Shanghai, because he had a queue and was nearsighted, had to sit in a sedan chair to come to Shanghai from his home, and then he built the revolutionary foundation of Shanghai. The central spirit of our central belief is wisdom, benevolence, and courage. The wisdom we speak of is the great wisdom that Sun Yat-sen spoke of, not the petty wisdom and cleverness that seeks personal gain at the expense of others. It is the wisdom of great intellect, such as knowing how to consolidate the position of the nation, knowing how to develop the implementation of democracy, knowing how to strive to realize the construction of people's livelihood, understanding the trends of the world, recognizing the current position of China, and that the reactionary forces that hinder the future of the revolution must be fundamentally eliminated. We must see everything, and we must do everything thoroughly. This is the cultivation of our wisdom. Therefore, we must embrace our central belief and strive forward. Benevolence is the benevolent heart that everyone has, but ordinary people only know so-called womanly benevolence and hypocritical benevolence. They cannot see the interests of humanity, so they are not the people of universal love that Sun Yat-sen spoke of. So, this point must first be seen clearly. Of course, courage is not just the courage of a common man. It is rational courage, the great courage to regard death as going home, not the evil courage of being fond of courage and fighting fiercely. It is the courage of which Sun Yat-sen spoke, the courage of the fearless, for the sake of the country, for the sake of compatriots, for the sake of humanity, for the sake of the world, that cannot be moved by any kind of interest or subdued by any kind of force. When a person is in society and is criticized by society, there is no need to be discouraged. Such courage can consolidate and magnify our central belief. When we think of the wisdom, benevolence, and courage that Sun Yat-sen entrusted to us, the great virtues of heaven and earth, they are the guidelines for everyone's cultivation. Just now, listening to the chairman speaking about the importance of believing in the central force, I remembered that many of the seventy-two martyrs, as well as those who did not die in the disaster, were my friends. I know that they all have great abilities and have fully cultivated wisdom, benevolence, and courage. Their benevolence, their wisdom, and their courage are deeply recognized by everyone. Their great spirit of sometimes sacrificing themselves for the sake of doctrine and regarding death as going home can thoroughly implement the central belief and put Sun Yat-sen's doctrine on the road to realization. Today, at this sorrowful memorial meeting, I feel many emotions. I hope that everyone can take the seventy-two martyrs as a model and cultivate themselves in the way that the seventy-two martyrs cultivated themselves, and work together for the revolution. It is certain that we can complete our revolution in the shortest possible time. Don't say that we have few comrades or that comrades have a shallow understanding of doctrine. Even if there are any disputes among comrades, as long as everyone cultivates themselves according to the spirit of the seventy-two martyrs and works together according to the central belief, the freedom and equality of the country and the construction of people's livelihood will be hopeful in the near future." "Pan Gongzhan's Speech": "Today, we are all here to mourn the seventy-two martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound. Just now, I heard the speeches and reports of the chairman and Mayor Zhang. I think that the comrades present here, as well as the general comrades and people who did not attend, and thinking of the sacrifice and bloodshed of the seventy-two martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound, will surely weep and surely feel emotional and sorrowful. Just now, hearing the speeches of the chairman and the mayor, we deeply know that we must work for the revolution and for the people and learn from the example of the seventy-two martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound on that day. I remember that Sun Yat-sen once said at a memorial meeting for the martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound: 'In commemorating the martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound, we should learn the morality of the martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound.' In Sun Yat-sen's words, there is only one sentence, which is that each person must sacrifice everything, and of course life is also included, to serve the country and society, with service as the purpose, not with the purpose of fighting for rights. What I heard just now was also like this. The chairman also talked about the direction of our efforts in the future, and Mayor Zhang also talked about how we should cultivate ourselves with wisdom, benevolence, and courage in the future. So, now, if I were to say it again, I wouldn't be able to say anything. Let me just add a few words to the points of wisdom, benevolence, and courage that Mayor Zhang spoke of. The scope of knowledge, the scope of benevolence, and the scope of courage are all very broad. Taking the seventy-two martyrs as an example, of course, there were those who started the uprising at the same time and were spared from disaster, but the overall number of those who started the uprising was very small, only a few dozen people. Why were they able to succeed in such a great cause? We cannot help but admire them immensely. How many comrades does our Party have now? If we say few, there are 100,000, if we say many, there are 200,000, but there are always that many. Having 200,000 Party members, why can't they use their power to complete the cause of the seventy-two martyrs? Why is the unification now fake? Why are the reactionary warlords, reactionary politicians, and reactionary literati still constantly causing trouble there? We don't need to scold the arrogance of the reactionary elements. We want to scold the 200,000 Party members, including myself. From the central government to the district branches, everyone must deeply blame themselves. Why can't we be as great and successful as the seventy-two martyrs? We know that the reason why the seventy-two martyrs were able to succeed is that after knowing themselves, the most important thing is that we must know ourselves. Every day, during Sun Yat-sen's memorial week or during today's silence, we think about the seventy-two martyrs doing this kind of work, which is completely for the happiness of society and the people. Whenever we do something, is it for the country and for the majority of people? Is there even a trace of selfishness? We must deeply reflect. We must be able to know what places should be changed and what places should be worked hard for. Only in this way can we be blameless and be a revolutionary. If we are muddle-headed and confused all day long, how can we continue the legacy of the martyrs? Therefore, every time a day passes, we must ask ourselves whether what we did that day was beneficial to society. If it was not beneficial to society, then that day was wasted. If a day is not wasted, then it is a wise revolutionary. What is benevolence? Mayor Zhang said that it is universal love, which is also consideration. Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself. Consideration can be said to be the starting point of universal love, which is also the starting point of benevolence. In this way, the separation between people can be eliminated. But can we do this? I believe that there are definitely times when we cannot. We should think this way: Why do we want to relieve the suffering of the people? We must know that we are also one of the people. The suffering of the people is the suffering that we ourselves experience. Starting from this point to liberate the people is true revolution and can prescribe the right medicine. Therefore, the benevolent revolutionary should take consideration as the starting point. What about courage? Mayor Zhang has already talked about the great courage. What I want to say is that in addition to sacrificing oneself to achieve benevolence, which is great courage, we must immediately correct our mistakes when we discover them. This is also courage. The courage I speak of also starts from personal courage. What mistakes do we have? What things did we do wrong? It doesn't matter. Take Sun Yat-sen's legacy as a model. If we have mistakes, we must understand them ourselves and accept the guidance of others and dare to correct them. If someone does not accept the opinions of others, then they are wrong to the end and there is no way to fix them. They are not even worthy of learning from the seventy-two martyrs. In short, the first thing is to know yourself. The second thing is to use your own heart to speculate about the suffering of the people and find ways to solve their problems. The third thing is to dare to correct your mistakes and start anew. If we can do this, we can work for the country and for the people and be worthy of learning even one ten-thousandth or one thousandth of the spirit of the seventy-two martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound." End of the speech.</p>
<p>Assembly Memorial Oration: On this, the 29th day of March in the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang, leading all Party members and people from all walks of life in the city, respectfully offer incense and flowers to the spirits of the seventy-two martyrs, saying: "Since the Manchurian barbarians entered the pass, the Ming Dynasty was overthrown. The monkeys who bathed and called themselves emperors made the descendants of the gods their servants. The Han rituals vanished, and the people were dressed as barbarians. For more than two hundred years, the national hatred has not been avenged. Then, the powers invaded frequently, and we became fish on the chopping board. We grieve that the foundation of the country is weakening and the people's livelihood is deteriorating. Why does the spirit of Huang not pity us, so that our divine land is in danger? Only the pioneers rose up, displayed the spirit of revolution, and raised the flag of righteousness in Guangdong to save the nation from sinking. Although the accumulated difficulties are hard to reverse, they would rather die to achieve benevolence, ultimately stripping away the courage of the Manchurian barbarians and reviving the dying national soul of China. They eliminated the aura of the White Mountains and destroyed Qin with three households of Chu. The righteousness of Wuchang was proclaimed, and we rejoiced that the rivers and mountains were renewed. Tracing the merits from beginning to end, we cherish the legacy of the pioneer martyrs. Alas, bury your ambitions in the vast land, your loyal blood shines on Yellow Flower Mound in Guangdong. We mourn the national tragedy from afar and sing the soul-summoning song of Chu. We lament that time passes quickly and that nineteen years have passed. We offer fragrant petals and recite the oration, our tears falling like rain. May your spirit not be dimmed, but shine throughout the millennia without end. Alas, accept our offering."</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Prevents Books from Fujian Province from Flowing into Japan</h3>
<p>Gong Yitu, a respected elder in Fujian, built a Datong Building to house a book collection, containing many rare and unique books from within the country, worth over 200,000 yuan. Recently, the Gong family has fallen into decline, and his descendants are selling these books. Yang Shuzhuang, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, originally planned to purchase them for public ownership for 40,000 yuan, but the Gong family was skeptical due to the installment payment method. Coincidentally, Lin Yuanbo, a Taiwanese citizen, introduced a certain Japanese company that purchased these books for 30,000 yuan. It is reported that a large portion of the books has already been shipped out, but important rare books have not yet been shipped. These books are related to national documents, and it is a pity that they are flowing into the East Sea. The Ministry of Education has consulted with the Ministry of Finance to quickly telegraph the Fuhai Customs to detain them, and at the same time telegraph the provincial government to instruct the Department of Education to temporarily store them in the safe keeping, prepare cash, and collect them for preservation in the provincial library.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Department of Education Convenes County Education Bureau Chiefs (3)</h3>
<p>The fourth meeting of the first convocation of education bureau chiefs in Jiangsu was held at the Department of Education at 9:10 AM on the 27th. Chairman: Director Chen, Section Chief Yang, Nai Kang (deputy), Recorders: Yang Changyun, Zhang Jialin.</p>
<p>Reporting Matters: The chairman reported on the review process of each group.</p>
<p>Discussion Items: A. Education Funding Group: 1. How should we maintain the annual increase in education land tax in each county? (Proposed by Songjiang) Resolution: (1) Counties where the total amount of land tax has not yet reached the 1% limit should follow the "Measures for Reorganizing Education Land Tax in Each County" promulgated by the provincial government to increase the tax as much as possible to meet the fixed amount. (2) The provincial government should determine detailed standards and procedures for estimating land prices in each county, and order each county to publicly estimate the land value, instead of relying on the virtual data of a small number of agencies as the basis for the decision. 2. The education land tax in the Yang territory should also be changed to a per-mu calculation plan. (Proposed by Fengxian) Resolution: The education land tax case was originally calculated and approved based on the per-mu tax rate. The territory should be handled uniformly. It can be submitted separately for approval. 3. Cancellation of the "discounted fields" category and uniformly increasing the grain tax. (Proposed by Fengxian) Resolution: This is a special issue for each county and should be submitted separately for approval. 4. Can each county submit a request to the provincial department to collect the education land tax in one lump sum during the busy season? (Proposed by Taicang) Resolution: The situation in each county is different and it is not appropriate to handle it uniformly. Each county should refer to the situation in its own county and submit a special case for approval. 5. Request to levy reed land tax. (Proposed by Zhenjiang) Resolution: The education land tax does not distinguish between grain land, reed land, or salt land, and should be collected uniformly according to the plan. The method of collection should be carefully drafted by each county in a special case and submitted for approval. 6. County funds cannot bear the various subsidies for university students and normal school students; how should these be reliably funded in the future? (Proposed by Songjiang) Resolution: All kinds of subsidies for university students and normal school students in each county should be canceled, except for the People's Education Institute and the Labor-Peasant Institute, which have other regulations. 7. How should funds be raised to develop advanced elementary schools in each county? (Proposed by Songjiang) Resolution: In the future, 30% of the newly added funds in each county should be used for social education expenses, 50% for compulsory education expenses, and 20% for the development of advanced elementary schools, except for education land tax, foil tax, special tax, etc., which have special regulations. 8. Reorganization of school land. (Proposed by Fengxian) Resolution: (1) Each county education bureau should clean it up on its own. (2) The rent collection of school land should be collected according to local rental practices. (3) The newly emerged beaches that are connected to the original school land can be taxed by the Education Bureau without price increase (to be implemented by the Department to the Ministry). 9. Request to levy Sutra Chanting donation. (Proposed by Zhenjiang) Resolution: Each county should submit it separately for approval. 10. Increase in salt tax. (Proposed by Zhenjiang) Resolution: According to the original plan of levying five li per catty, submit it to the Department of Education to request the Ministry of Finance to approve and implement it. 11. Request to collect local education donation along with the railway. (Proposed by Zhenjiang) Resolution: Please refer to the Department of Education for review and handling. 12. Measures to prevent misappropriation of education funds. (Proposed by Zhenjiang) Resolution: The educational funding is not within the scope of the local finance department's management. An earlier order from the provincial government has already been filed, and the Education Department should reiterate the previous order to instruct the counties to comply. B. Social Education Group: 13. How should the people's education in each county adapt to the needs of society, improve the people's lives, realize local autonomy, and complete the work of political tutelage?

Should the implementation of compulsory people's education system be implemented first for the establishment of people's schools?

It seems that each county should first make appropriate improvements in terms of teaching time, teaching materials, and teaching methods to suit the needs of the people, and please ask the People's Education Institute to systematically report the results of its research for reference. 15. How should the social education institutions in each county be reorganized, expanded, and improved to increase the efficiency of social education? (Proposed by Zhenjiang, Kunshan, Nantong, and Fengxian) Resolution: Please refer to the methods proposed by each county for the Department of Education, and issue separate orders to each county to comply. 16. How should vocational supplementary education in each county be earnestly promoted and developed to increase the production of the people? (Proposed by Zhenjiang, Nantong, Kunshan, and Fengxian) Resolution: Refer to the methods proposed by Nantong, Zhenjiang, Kunshan, and Fengxian, and the Department will order each county to quickly establish several vocational supplementary schools based on local needs, and the Department will consider establishing schools to train vocational teachers and vocational supplementary schools, or establish vocational supplementary classes in provincial elementary schools.

<h3>Suggestions from the Foreign Goods Industry Regarding the High Gold and Low Silver</h3>
<p>Increase Silver Tax... Coin Silver Dollars... Prohibit Gold Exports. The Foreign Goods Business Association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and Industry on the 27th of this month, saying: "To the Ministry of Finance and Industry: China's property is all calculated in silver. If the price of silver falls by several percent, the property loss will be several percent. Moreover, domestic industries are still in their infancy. From government construction to people's needs, foreign goods must be purchased. Once the exchange rate is reduced, the price of goods must be high. The impact of high gold and low silver is unavoidable for almost everyone, not just import traders who are on the verge of bankruptcy. Observing the general trend, it is almost hopeless for the price of silver to recover naturally in the future. This matter concerns international economy, and it is impossible to save the crisis without the power of the government. The way to save it is to immediately increase the current silver tax rate to prevent the source, coin common silver dollars to increase demand, and prohibit cash exports to plug loopholes. All should be complementary to achieve rapid results. The Department oversees the finances, protects industry and commerce, and is the hope of all. Please make a quick decision and implement it."</p>
<h3>No Reciprocity in the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement</h3>
<p>The National Goods Factory Association Informs All Members and Factories</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Association sent Notice No. 252 to all member factories on March 25th, stating: "Previously, because the report stated that the Sino-Japanese reciprocal tariff agreement would harm the promotion of national goods, this association sent a telegram to the three ministries of industry, commerce, finance, and foreign affairs, requesting them to argue reasonably and reject it. The original telegram is recorded below (omitted above). The report stated that the new Sino-Japanese agreement had been finalized, with more than one hundred kinds of goods with reciprocal tariffs, including cotton yarn and cotton cloth. The goods imported by Japan are all industrial re-products, while the goods exported by China are all raw materials. The current situation of China's cotton textile industry is in a critical period. This reciprocal treaty will condemn the cotton textile industry to death, and the relationship between the national economy and the people's livelihood is extremely important. Please pay attention to maintaining the lifeline of national goods and preventing other countries from following suit." After that, we received Approval No. 8795 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating, "The telegram has been received. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been consulted to check and handle the matter." The letter also contained Internal Telegram No. 4029 from the Ministry of Finance, stating, "The telegram has been received. Our country has negotiated and concluded autonomous tariff treaties with the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries. The discussions with Japan are also handled in accordance with the precedents of various countries, and there is no reciprocity." Please inform all concerned. In view of this, a letter is hereby sent to you for your information."</p>

<p>Li Shijia, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of the Navy, arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing yesterday morning. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency met him at the Naval Demobilization Office in this city, and the following is a brief conversation that took place: (Reporter asked) What is the purpose of your visit to Shanghai this time?

At this point, Commander Chen Xunyong of the training fleet and Li went out, and they separated.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Expansion of Soviet-Russian Shipping to China</h3>
<p>After the cessation of hostilities between China and Russia last winter, the Soviet-Russian Commercial Fleet resumed shipping to China, starting with freight transportation, as the foundation for developing trade with China. By mid-March of this year, the sea traffic in northern Russia was unobstructed due to the thawing of ice. The fleet's shipping to China has undergone a large-scale expansion and is now proceeding rapidly. This matter is of great importance to my country's commercial shipping rights, and the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Eight Ships Added to Shanghai-Vladivostok Route: The Shanghai-Vladivostok route is exclusively operated by the Commercial Team by permission of the Soviet-Russian authorities. Shanghai has entrusted the British firm Laisiyanghang to exclusively dispatch ships and manage them with full authority. Import certificates are generally not issued to other countries' merchant ships. In December last winter, Lais dispatched two ships to operate, specializing in transporting Chinese tea and Russian fish. On March 20th of this year, the Commercial Team, due to the fact that the coasts of northern Russia could now be navigated by ship and the volume of passengers and cargo between China and Russia had increased sharply, sent a special telegram to Laisiyanghang in Shanghai to quickly add six merchant ships to the Shanghai-Vladivostok route. Laisiyanghang has added all the Taishan, Maler, and Aisibai Maler ships to this route, and on April 3rd, the 4,000-ton Henry Lefebvre was added again. The Shanghai-Vladivostok route has expanded from two ships to eight ships, and two sailings can be made each month.</p>
<p>Twenty Ships Added to Northern Russia: There are many bays along the 58th and 60th degrees north latitude in the northern part of Vladivostok, which are Russian special fishing zones, and a large amount is sold to China every year. Now that the ice has thawed, a large number of sea fish need to be loaded onto ships. The Soviet-Russian Commercial Team sent a special telegram to Mr. Maler, the owner of Laisiyanghang in this city, ordering him to charter a large number of merchant ships in Shanghai and quickly open them to the north of Russia. Over the past few days, Maler has chartered 20 merchant ships, ranging from 3,000 tons to 6,000 tons, including the Taishan and Fulinaiqian, from Chinese and Norwegian shipping companies in Shanghai. After the ships were chartered, they have been sailing from Shanghai to Vladivostok for several days, where they were taken over by the Commercial Team and dispatched to various ports on the coast of northern Russia to connect with the Shanghai-Vladivostok route. From now on, the amount of Russian goods coming to Shanghai will gradually increase.</p>
<p>Chinese Crew Members' Limited Items: The restrictions on Chinese crew members arriving in Russia are very strict. Now that a large number of Chinese ships are going to Russia, the Soviet-Russian authorities have promulgated regulations on the items that Chinese crew members can carry, stipulating the quota, which is very strict. If the quota is exceeded, they will not be allowed to enter Vladivostok and must hand over the items and store them in the customs warehouse, otherwise they will be confiscated. For the convenience of Chinese seafarers going to Russia, the following is a list of the items that are allowed to be brought in: one Chinese winter and summer blanket each, two sheets, six face towels, two scarves, three work clothes, two Western-style short clothes, six pairs of winter and summer socks each, two trunks, one overcoat, three peaked caps, one pair of leather shoes and rubber shoes each, three pairs of Chinese shoes, four Chinese-style short shirts, two Western-style short shirts, one flannel shirt, four sets of underwear, two copper basins, three bottles of Chinese wine, one hundred cigarettes, six bars of perfumed soap, three bars of laundry soap, fifty boxes of matches, and one small mirror.</p>
<p>Chinese People Can Go to Russia: The ban on Chinese people going to Russia has been in place for six months since last year. Now the ban is gradually being relaxed. From the end of this month, the Soviet-Russian authorities have allowed Chinese people to go to Vladivostok within a limited scope. The Guilde Consulate in Shanghai issues passports. It is heard that in addition to the entry passport, a health passport is also required. When Chinese people arrive in Vladivostok, they must be examined by a customs doctor before being allowed to go ashore. Since last year, travelers to Russia have had to travel by ship from Tsuruga, Japan, but now they can travel directly by ship from Shanghai to Russia.</p>
<h3>Plan to Manufacture Coastal Patrol Ships</h3>
<p>More Than 600,000 Funding Has Been Raised</p>
<p>According to naval sources, Chen Ce, commander of the Fourth Fleet, recently revised the previously proposed plan to manufacture two shallow-water gunboats due to the pacification of Dapeng Bay, changing it to the construction of two coastal patrol ships, 125 feet long, 14 feet wide, and 7 feet deep in draft, the same type as the Zhongshan ship, specially stationed in the bay. It is heard that this shipbuilding plan is currently being planned by technician Feng Yuzhi. The cost of constructing the two ships is approximately 600,000 yuan, and the funding has already been raised. As soon as the plan is completed, manufacturing can begin.</p>
<h3>Chinese Can Still Go to Nanyang</h3>
<p>Passport Application Still Easy</p>
<p>A certain gentleman at the Passport Office of the Foreign Affairs Division of the Public Security Bureau said that the issuance of passports for traveling, studying, or doing business in Europe and America is indeed strictly controlled. However, for Chinese people going to the Nanyang Islands, such as Java and Singapore, to do business, passports can be issued as long as they comply with the regulations of the Ministry, obtain a formal introduction from the Chamber of Commerce, and provide reliable guarantees. This is because there are many overseas Chinese in the Nanyang Islands doing business, and they are very enthusiastic about promoting domestic products, so they cannot be treated the same as those going to Europe and America.</p>
<h3>Provisional Court Rushing to Close</h3>
<p>Xu Weizhen, the president of both the Provisional Court and the Court of Appeal, went to the capital on the 25th because the reorganization was imminent and all important matters needed to be reported to the authorities for instructions. Now that he has completed his official duties, he returned to Shanghai the morning before yesterday. He immediately went to the court and ordered all departments to rush to close their cases. The court staff's work suddenly became intense. Yesterday was the Huanghuagang Memorial Day. Although the court still suspended civil and criminal cases as usual, all staff members did not have time to rest and all came to the court as usual to work hard. It is heard that they will also have to handle handover matters this week and will not rest for the time being.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Recommends Judicial Police for the Special District Court</h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reported that after the Provisional Court is reorganized into the Special District Court on the first day of next month, all judicial police will be appointed by the president from those recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council, in accordance with the agreement. The Shanghai Municipal Council has already drawn up a list of candidates, which will be submitted to President Xu today (29th) for appointment. The total number is 30, among whom some foreign officers will be assigned, which is the number of those currently on duty in the court. It is planned to recommend Detective Hearding to be in charge of the inner shift, and Detective McKenna to be in charge of the outer shift, while the current Assistant Secretary-General and Chief Patrolman Wheeler will also be transferred to the judicial police team.</p>
<h3>Domestic Products to be Exhibited in Hangzhou on a Fixed Date</h3>
<p>Loading Goods on April 2nd</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Union sent letters to all factories yesterday, asking them to register immediately in order to participate in the National Products Exhibition in Hangzhou. The letter stated: "To all, previously, the Hangzhou Municipal National Products Promotion Committee established the first National Products Mobile Exhibition and sent a letter inviting our union to participate. We convened a general meeting of factory representatives on the 26th of this month and resolved to participate. Each booth will cost 20 silver dollars, and each additional booth will cost 10 silver dollars. The site fee and business tax will be waived. Our union will send personnel to Hangzhou, and all expenses will cost 10 silver dollars per booth. Mr. Zhang Baoshan was immediately sent to Hangzhou with a letter to negotiate. We have just received a quick letter from the committee stating that all the conditions we proposed have been agreed to. Moreover, because our union is participating, the opening date was feared to be too late for April 1st, so it has been resolved to extend the exhibition by five days, changing it to April 5th to 18th. We are writing to inform you specifically. If your factory wishes to participate, please come to the union to register (deadline is April 1st) so that goods can be loaded on April 2nd. Time is pressing, please do not delay. This is our sincere hope. Respectfully to all factories, Shanghai National Products Factory Union."</p>
<h3>Inspection Bureau Sends a Letter to the Tung Oil Industry Urging Attention to Credit</h3>
<p>Tung oil for export must be inspected by the Inspection Bureau and issued a certificate before it can be declared for export. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau recently discovered that after Shanghai tung oil for export is reported to the bureau for inspection, it is often mixed with transshipped tung oil and exported fraudulently. This matter not only renders the inspection policy ineffective but also may affect foreign trade. The bureau specially notified all tung oil merchants yesterday, urging them to pay attention to credit and avoid becoming an obstacle to the development of foreign trade. The original letter stated: "To all, tung oil is a famous product of our country and can replace linseed oil for various coatings. In recent years, exports to foreign countries have been increasing day by day, and the future is very promising. However, as the world's needs gradually increase, more attention should be paid to foreign credit in order to develop as much as possible in the international market. If one is greedy for small profits at present and does not hesitate to cheat others by making false claims, then credit will decline and failure can be expected. The lessons of silk and tea should serve as a warning. This bureau has recently discovered that Shanghai tung oil for export is reported to the bureau for inspection, but is often mixed with transshipped tung oil and exported in mixed shipments. This bureau believes that this kind of behavior, because the two types of tung oil are mixed, will make the inspection results recorded in the inspection certificates issued by this bureau and other bureaus inconsistent. If this is the case, not only will the inspection certificates lose their effectiveness, but also the foreign trade of tung oil may be affected. It is necessary to correct this vigorously in order to uphold the government's purpose of handling inspection policies. In addition to sending personnel to explain the reasons to the Jianghai Customs and requesting that they no longer accommodate such practices in the future, we are also writing to urge your company to pay attention and advise your colleagues not to allow such matters to occur again, so as to jointly maintain the credit of tung oil in foreign trade. This is our sincere hope."</p>
<h3>Sino-Swedish Scientific Expedition Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Members of the Sino-Swedish Scientific Expedition, Swedish entomologist Dr. Hummel, German botanist Mr. Boekenkand, and Chinese botanist Hao Jingsheng, arrived in Shanghai on the 27th aboard the British ship Tongzhou from Ping. After staying in Shanghai for a few days, they will go west to conduct investigations in Gansu and Qinghai.</p>
<h3>Mr. Black Still Not Leaving Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Black, the owner of the American *Sun*, was unable to leave yesterday due to winds in Korea. It is said that if the weather is fine on Monday, he will set off for Seoul, make some connections, then go to Tokyo, and then take a ship back to the United States.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Construction Department Orders Investigation of Road Construction in Baoshan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Construction Bureau received an order from the Jiangsu Construction Department yesterday, stating: "According to a report from the Baoshan Fellow Villagers Association in Beijing, the Baoluo Line in Baoshan, from Baoshan County to Yuewu Town and Zhucun Temple, connects to the north-south trunk road. However, there are two routes that can be taken from Baoshan through Yuewu Town to Zhucun Temple: (1) According to local public opinion, go directly west from Zhucun Temple to the southern end of Luodian Town, the bus station of the Baoshan North-South County Road, and connect to the Jiabao County Road; (2) According to the survey by the Baoshan Construction Bureau, go north from Zhucun Temple, pass through the northern end of Luodian Town, and connect to the Jiabao County Road. The first route is closer to the south of Luodian, and the second route is closer to the north of Luodian. Municipal facilities are now tending to emphasize the south, so the bus station is also located in the southern end of the city. If the two routes from Zhucun Temple to Luodian Town are compared, the southern route is more than three miles shorter than the northern route, two or three bridges can be saved, and municipal facilities are more convenient. Therefore, the public opinion of Luodian citizens favors the southern route in the construction plan of the Baoluo Line. Moreover, when the Baoshan Construction Bureau surveyed the northern route, it did not consult with the Luodian District Office regarding municipal matters when passing through Luodian Town. The survey was conducted casually without any concrete plan. Whether it has any connection with Luodian's municipal facilities, whether the route can be economical, whether the number of bridges can be reduced, and whether the number of graves can be reduced have not been taken into account by both public and private parties. The work was done hastily, and it will be too late to regret it when the project starts in the future. Fellow villagers serving in the capital are concerned about the construction situation in their hometown and the traffic plan between Jiading and Baoshan. We respectfully request the director to immediately send personnel to thoroughly investigate and comprehensively design the project, and appropriately divert the route in order to emphasize construction. The people of Jiading and Baoshan counties will all benefit from it." Therefore, this route has already been approved by this department. Whether the reasons stated by the reporters are true, in addition to instructions, the bureau director is ordered to go nearby to conduct a thorough investigation and report back to serve as a basis for approval. Do not delay this order. Bureau Director Wu Wenhua is scheduled to go to conduct a detailed survey this morning (Sunday).</p>
<h3>No Foreign Garrison Troops or Police Found Within the County</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received instructions from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, which were forwarded from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the ministry is currently planning to handle the withdrawal of foreign garrison troops and police in China, but it is necessary to first investigate the number of people and their locations in order to handle the matter. A form was issued, ordering the department to instruct its subordinates to follow the instructions and fill it out. County Magistrate Leng immediately instructed the County Public Security Bureau to forward the instructions to various sub-bureaus for detailed investigation and reporting. Subsequently, the sub-bureaus reported one after another that there were no foreign garrison troops or police within their jurisdictions. Therefore, Director Shen has reported to the County Government for review.</p>
<h3>Foreign Affairs Division Passport Office Moves Today</h3>
<p>Office Opens on the First Day</p>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Division Passport Office of the Shanghai Special Municipal Public Security Bureau, originally attached to the old Jiaoshu, is now being moved back to the Public Security Bureau for operation by Director Yuan because it is not very convenient for handling matters. It is heard that it is scheduled to start operating on April 1st, and a notice has already been issued yesterday.</p>
<h3>Two Ships Collide in Front of the Bund Park</h3>
<p>The Shanghai *Times* reported that yesterday evening (28th) at 6:15, the Yili ship (transliteration) collided head-on with the Chongqing ship when it sailed to the Bund Park, because the tide was rapid. The bow of the Yili ship was damaged, but it was not a major problem because it was above the waterline. It immediately returned to Nanshi. The Chongqing ship was not seriously damaged and continued to sail to the Taikoo Wharf in Pudong as usual.</p>
<h3>British and Japanese Ships Collide in Heavy Fog</h3>
<p>Shanghai has been shrouded in heavy fog for days. Dozens of merchant ships blocked outside Wusong finally arrived in Shanghai one after another yesterday. The Ryucho Maru, a cargo ship (registered tonnage of 1,900 tons) of the Dalian Sato Company, which this time transported a full load of coal from Miike, Japan, to Shanghai, anchored outside Wusong fifty nautical miles on the morning of the 28th due to heavy fog and sounded its horn as a warning, intending to enter the port after the fog cleared. Unexpectedly, the Ningbo, a ship of the British Taikoo Company, also sailed from Sanjiashui to Shanghai. Because the route was obscured by the fog, it sailed into the same line as the Ryucho Maru. After being discovered, the two ships quickly reversed to avoid each other, but the bows of the Ningbo and Ryucho Maru each collided once. Fortunately, the impact was still light. The Ryucho only damaged the iron plates of the outer hull. The bow of the Ningbo ship also suffered minor damage. After the fog cleared, they sailed to Shanghai. The Ryucho Maru stopped at the Mitsui Wharf. Araki, the Japanese maritime officer stationed in Shanghai, inspected the ship and found that the damage was still minor, requiring approximately 2,000 yuan in repair costs. He ordered it to be repaired in Shanghai. As for the Ningbo ship, the damaged area did not affect the cargo hold, so after a slight repair, it could still sail as usual.</p>

<h3>Vang-wa-du Park in the Bright Spring Sunshine</h3>
<p>Seven Rare Parrots Have Arrived</p>
<p>Eagles and Wild Boars Will Be Transported Soon</p>
<p>Peach Blossoms and Cherry Blossoms are in Full Bloom</p>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reported that the zoo attached to Vang-wa-du Park recently acquired seven rare parrots, which were entrusted to the park by Mr. Oestreich. These birds were originally intended to be transported to the San Diego Zoo in the United States, but the US government has banned the import of parrots, so they are temporarily staying in Shanghai. Although their size is similar to that of ordinary parrots, their feathers are exceptionally beautiful. One of the birds has a golden beak, another has a red and white beak, and its head is black. Yet another bird has two red lines on its dark green chest, which are not commonly seen. In addition, the park has added two new animals, one is an eagle, which has a wingspan of four feet when its wings are spread, which is quite large, and the other is a wild boar, which will be transported soon. A new road has been opened in the park, directly leading to the zoo, so it is no longer necessary to pay an additional fee to go from the park to the zoo. The peach blossoms and cherry blossoms in the park are now in full bloom, and there are many visitors. Last Sunday, the number of visitors reached as many as 7,000.</p>
<h3>With a Loud Bang, a Bomb Exploded</h3>
<p>An Apprentice Picked Up a Paper Package</p>
<p>Prying it Open with Force Caused a Tremendous Explosion</p>
<p>One Worker Was Killed Instantly</p>
<p>Five People Were Seriously Injured</p>
<p>At 8:15 last night, a tragic bombing occurred in the Gong family's weaving factory at No. 2 Daxumu Bridge Road, Xiesu Road, Nanshi. One worker was killed instantly, and five people were seriously injured. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Opening a Cloth Factory: Gong Shixun, a 37-year-old man from Anhui, has been running the Xinglong Weaving Factory at No. 2 Daxumu Bridge Road, Xiesu Road, Nanshi, for many years. The capital is very small, with only six looms, employing seven or eight weaving and spinning workers. The income is barely enough to make ends meet.</p>
<p>A Package Left on the Roadside: Last night, Gong invited his fellow villager Zhou Cunyu (35 years old, running the Xiangsheng Cloth Factory at No. 1600 Xujiahui Road) to his home for dinner. Zhou arrived on time, but when he passed Daxumu Bridge, he saw a paper package left on the roadside. At that time, Zhou did not pick it up but went directly to Gong's house and told him about it. Li Yuanfa, Gong's apprentice, heard this and ran out to pick up the paper package. He opened it and saw an iron can and two glass bottles. Li intended to pry it open with force, and then there was a loud bang, beyond control.</p>
<p>A Tremendous Explosion: At that time, Gong and three or five friends were sipping tea in the Republic Tea Garden at No. 7 across the street, waiting for Zhou to arrive for dinner. While they were talking, they suddenly heard a loud explosion, shaking the houses. All the tea guests rushed out to check. They saw thick smoke coming out of Gong's factory, and one worker had been killed at the door, with five people injured, all lying on the ground. Gong urgently hired vehicles and sent the injured to the hospital first, and reported to the Xinxi District Sub-Bureau of the Second District General Bureau.</p>
<p>Death and Injury: When the bomb exploded, the small boats parked in the Xujiahui Creek nearby were shaken non-stop. The intensity of the explosion was unimaginable. All the miscellaneous items in the factory were blown apart, but the roof was covered with heavy tiles, so it was not blown through. The worker who was killed was named Li Yuanfa, 17 years old, from Hefei East Township, Anhui. He came to Shanghai from his hometown at the beginning of this year and was recommended by a fellow villager to learn spinning at the factory, with a monthly salary of only three yuan. His father, Li Zhengjia, is a porter in Hefei, and his mother, Zhou, are both in their hometown. The five seriously injured are Gong's wife, Zhang, 27 years old, injured in both legs; Zhou Cunyu, seriously injured and in critical condition; a young child named Xiaomanzi; and two workers, Wang Yishun and Wang Yihan.</p>
<p>Police Gathered: After the incident, the Xinxi District Sub-Bureau urgently dispatched police officers to the scene. At the same time, they telegraphed the Second District General Bureau. District Chief Wang also rushed to the scene to investigate and report to the General Bureau. Because the area was only separated from the French Concession by a creek, the French police also dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate.</p>
<h3>Lin Zengyun, Manager of the Dahe Shipping Company, Kidnapped</h3>
<p>In Front of the Minzhi Girls' School</p>
<p>Three Kidnappers Came Suddenly</p>
<p>A Car Was Found on Jumen Road</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau is Conducting a Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Lin Zengyun, the manager of the Dahe Shipping Company next to the Lianhua Company on Avenue Edward VII, was kidnapped by bandits yesterday morning. The situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>Lin Zengyun's Family: Lin Zengyun, from Ningbo, is 34 years old and lives at No. 69, Longkou, Xinglong Village, Pushi Road, French Concession, along the road. He has been the manager of the Dahe Shipping Company next to the Lianhua Company at No. 38 Avenue Edward VII for eight years. The company has been operating prosperously. He is married to Ms. Jing, who is the same age as her husband. They have three sons: the eldest, Ashu, is 13 years old; the second son, Xiaolaohu, is 9 years old; and the third daughter, Yuanyuan, is 4 years old. He lives on Dongpusi Road, French Concession, and has a car, Concession license No. 7467, Municipal license No. 6142.</p>
<p>The Kidnapping: Lin has a car and personally drives it from home to the company every morning to handle business and returns home in the evening. This is his usual habit. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning (29th) at 8:00, Lin was driving his car from home to the company when three kidnappers suddenly appeared at the corner of Baierbu Road and the entrance of the Minzhi Girls' School. Each held a Mauser pistol and rushed onto the car, taking Lin into custody. One of the kidnappers drove the car quickly towards Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<p>Discovery of the Car: Lin's wife, Jing, whose mother's family is located at Rongyang Jilu across from the Bairtly Hospital on Zhizaoyi Road, was surprised to find that Lin's car was found on Jumen Road West at 9:00 in the morning. Zhang Gensheng, a member of the 11th Brigade of the Security Corps, could not find the owner of the car and reported it to the brigade headquarters. Squad leader Lin Zhigao led the members to take the car to the brigade headquarters. At 7:00 in the afternoon, Jing came to the brigade to retrieve it.</p>
<p>Reporting to the Police for Thorough Investigation: After Lin's family retrieved the car, they learned that Zengyun had been kidnapped. They immediately reported to the French police and the district offices of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>The case of the suspected death of Shao Han Jinshi in Changmen, Suzhou, the deceased's father and the woman's husband got into a lawsuit. It was said that she was poisoned, but the examination was inconclusive. There was once a sensational story of steaming bones for examination, which was later changed to dissection and examination. All the brain, body, internal organs, stomach, and intestines were taken out and stored in glass bottles. Yesterday, the Suzhou Court sent them to the Shanghai Local Court for forwarding to Nanyang Hospital for chemical examination and diagnosis.</p>
<h3>Wu Tieshan's Kidnapped Grandson Has Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Found in Chuansha County</p>
<p>Lawyer Wu Guotai (i.e., calligrapher Wu Tieshan), whose eighth beloved grandson, Baguan, whose given name is Liqian, is currently six years old and studies in primary school. On the 22nd of this month, he returned home from school after lunch, and was playing at the door when he suddenly disappeared. The whole family was shocked and searched everywhere. This has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that after the child was abducted, the abductors hid the child in the Sanwang Temple area of Chuansha County. Police Captain Xu Shiliang of the county police team supervised the police to solve the case, brought the abductors and the abducted child back to the county office, and interrogated them clearly. In addition to detaining the abductors for handling, he notified Lawyer Wu, who retrieved the child in Shanghai yesterday, and the family was reunited.</p>
<h3>Pinghu Gentlemen in Shanghai Petition for Repair of the Tang Pagoda in Western Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Wu Jing and other citizens of Pinghu in Shanghai sent a telegram to the authorities of the National Government, requesting that the Zhejiang Provincial Government be ordered to allocate funds for repairs as soon as possible in order to preserve cultural relics and demonstrate culture. The original telegram stated in brief, "The Twin Pagodas in front of the North Temple of Pinghu County were built in the Tang Dynasty, 997 years ago. They predate the Leifeng and Baoshu Pagodas and are the only ancient relics in western Zhejiang. Compared with the Tang sculptures in Kunshan, Jiangsu, they are comparable to Mount Tai and the Mausoleum of the Emperor. Because they have been in disrepair for many years, the top of the West Pagoda has been damaged. This area is now gradually becoming prosperous, and land prices have increased, so some people are using the excuse of danger to plan to demolish them and use the site for other purposes. The citizens are saddened to hear this. The ancient pagodas have been recorded in the county chronicles, and poets such as Zhu Yizun have sung their praises. Now, the Ministry of Internal Affairs has repeatedly consulted the Zhejiang government and ordered the Pinghu County Magistrate to report on the ancient relics, but two or three village chiefs and neighborhood chiefs who do not know historical allusions have arbitrarily planned to demolish them. Even if they are not acting negligently, they are close to deliberately violating the order of the superiors. Therefore, we urgently send this telegram, requesting that the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs be ordered by telegram to immediately order the Pinghu County Magistrate to allocate funds for repairs as soon as possible in order to preserve cultural relics and prevent danger. (Omission) If construction is started early, the cost will be limited and will not hinder the finances. If it is destroyed, it will be difficult to restore it. We sincerely plead, please approve."</p>
<h3>Statistics on New Buildings in Shanghai Last Year</h3>

In addition, there were more than 20 applications for theater construction permits in 1918, which shows the prosperity of the market in the Settlement, with a great trend of rising day by day.</p>
<h3>The Three Yu's Fight Over Property</h3>
<p>The late wealthy businessman Bu Jichen, originally from Haiyan, lived at No. 14 Xiangshun Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession. Before his death, he was a shareholder and manager of the Xieshang Foreign Goods Company on Avenue Joffre and served as a comprador for some foreign companies. After his death two years ago, he left behind hundreds of thousands of assets, which were divided in the same year. Now, his daughters Baoyu, Shengyu, and Ruoyu, because married daughters have the right to retroactive law, have specially hired Lawyer Cha Renwei to file a lawsuit with the French court to request a re-division. The defendants, three brothers and their stepmother Bu Bao, initially hired Lawyers Qian and Huang to act as agents and requested a postponement for an out-of-court settlement. Later, Bu Bao changed her mind and hired Lawyer Lu Jianai and canceled the agency of Lawyers Qian and Huang, unwilling to settle. The court session was held the day before yesterday. Judge Gong presided over the court. Only Bu Bao appeared as the defendant. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that the other defendants deliberately refused to accept the summons and had abandoned their right to defend themselves. He requested the court to make a judgment based on the plaintiff's arguments. The plaintiff argued that the re-division was based on Article 3 of the Implementing Rules for the Retroactive Inheritance of Property by Married Daughters. After the plaintiff's father died, he had been subject to the National Government, and the conditions were met. The defendant's defense was only that the plaintiffs had each received 3,000 yuan at the time, so they could not re-divide. It was not known that this was a gift and was not subject to Article 6, so the plaintiffs had no basis for division and were not included in the list of distributees. Their defense was obviously unreasonable. It was requested that the property of Bu Jichen be inherited by his children, regardless of gender, and re-divided equally. The defendant's lawyer argued that there were many dark secrets in this case, which were caused by the collusion of relatives such as Zhu Feizhang and Bu Hanshen and other defendants. The total amount of property was still hidden and not divided. The property must be investigated first, which is also in the interest of the plaintiffs. The plaintiff's lawyer said that the defendant's lawyer had not argued against the plaintiff's request for re-division, so he requested the court to make a judgment first, approving the re-division. As for the amount, the plaintiffs could not know in detail. Fortunately, the defendant had a basis for division that could be investigated. If it was said that there was still concealment in the previous analysis, then the plaintiffs were even more unaware. The defendant should present evidence and file a lawsuit against the person who concealed the property. If there was still concealment, the plaintiff would of course agree to investigate, but the plaintiff's request for re-division must first be decided to be valid, and then the amount will be reviewed. The defendant's lawyer believed that since investigating the concealment was also in the interest of the plaintiff, he had already admitted that the plaintiff's request for re-division was legitimate. There was no doubt about it, but this lawyer still had a statement to make. One side of the case was a legal issue, but the plaintiff and defendant were a family, and there had been several mediations before, which had been close. The defendant Bu Bao suddenly changed her mind and hired Lawyer Lu, unwilling to settle. I don't know if this is her true intention. Our lawyers are not involved with relatives, please ask the court directly about the two sides. The defendant's lawyer objected, saying that if this lawyer's statement violated my intention, I can correct it, why ask me? The two sides argued for a long time, and the court adjourned for two weeks, waiting for the summons of witness Zhu Feizhang, etc., for questioning.</p>

<h3>Party Headquarters Requests Prohibition of Gambling-Like Activities</h3>
<p>To Prevent the Development of Gambling Habits in Children</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters yesterday sent an official letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, stating: "In response to reports from subordinate district branches, peddlers engaging in gambling-like activities are rampant in various neighborhoods, negatively impacting children's habits. We hereby forward this information and earnestly request you to consult with the Municipal Public Security Bureau and order the strict prohibition of such activities. Our association has received reports from the Ninth District Branch stating that peddlers engaging in gambling-like activities are prevalent in various neighborhoods, including activities such as drawing cards, throwing dice, shaking lottery tickets, and playing pai gow. Although they appear to involve candy as winnings, the actual purpose is to deceive and obtain money. Children are innocent and unaware, and if they are constantly exposed to such activities, they will inevitably develop bad gambling habits, which will tarnish the purity of young people, causing us great distress. It is regrettable that the general beat police and patrol police seem to turn a blind eye to these activities. We earnestly request you to forward this report to the municipal department and consult with the Public Security Bureau to order strict prohibition." Based on this, the sections mentioned by the branch are indeed true, and strict measures should be taken to prevent children from developing negative impressions. Therefore, we submit this report and earnestly request you to consult with the Public Security Bureau and order strict prohibition. We eagerly await your response." Accordingly, we hereby request you to investigate and order strict prohibition.</p>
<h3>Mysterious Theft Case with Undisturbed Locks</h3>
<p>Three Suspects at Jiashun Pawnshop</p>
<p>Several days ago, a large quantity of gold jewelry pawned at the Jiashun Pawnshop, owned by Xiao Yuming from Huizhou, located at Wujiaochangqian, Caojiadu, West Shanghai, was stolen from the jewelry storage room. The locks on the boxes and doors remained undisturbed. When someone came to redeem an item with a ticket on the afternoon of the previous day, the loss of the gold jewelry was discovered. Xiao immediately conducted a thorough investigation and determined that the stolen gold jewelry was worth over four hundred silver dollars based on the pawn value, and over eight hundred silver dollars based on the market value. However, since the locks were not disturbed and there were no traces of forced entry, it was undoubtedly an inside job. Xiao immediately filed a report with the Sixth District Police Station in charge of the area. After receiving the report, District Chief Duan immediately dispatched the detective team leader Liu Shaoqing, along with other detectives, to the pawnshop for a detailed investigation. They detained six employees of the pawnshop for questioning: (1) Ye Guoduan, 16 years old, from Huizhou, an apprentice; (2) Xu Haichen, 18 years old, from Chaozhou, a cook; (3) Hu Deguan, 40 years old, from Huizhou, an assistant manager; (4) Yang Xiesheng, 18 years old, from Pudong, an apprentice; (5) Fei Benda, 21 years old, from Dongting, a bookkeeper; (6) Zhang Zhaohan, 33 years old, from Huizhou, the head manager. After Liu Shaoqing questioned them one by one, Ye, Xu, and Hu were suspected of theft. District Chief Duan then interrogated them separately. The statements of Ye, Xu, and Hu suggested they were involved in the theft. Yesterday, he prepared a document and transferred the three suspects to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Arson Case at Pharmacy: Judge Visits Witness to Take Testimony</h3>
<p>The Guangrentang Pharmacy on Avenue Edward VII was set on fire at the end of last year to claim insurance money. The scheme was discovered by the police, and a lawsuit was filed. The Provisional Court has already sentenced Zheng Zhaoxiang, the pharmacy manager, to seven years in prison. Zheng's daughter, Baozhen, believes her father was wrongly convicted and was misled by insurance broker Su Renqing (also known as Su Sien), who conspired with the pharmacy owner Wang Jiaxiang. The Zhabei Police Station rearrested Wang and Su and sent them to the court to await investigation. This newspaper has reported on this case several times. The day before yesterday, Judge Luo opened the court for a continued hearing. According to the police lawyer Ru Baoyi, the witness Du Boren had previously been ordered by the court to pay a 200-dollar bail. He is currently ill at home and his condition is serious. His family is also very poor and cannot afford bail. Therefore, the police have stationed a Chinese constable at his home to prevent him from escaping. However, it is unlikely that he will recover from his illness in the short term. The lawyer requested the judge to visit Du's home to take his testimony because Wang Jiaxiang claimed that he had transferred the Guangrentang pharmacy to someone else in September last year. The transfer agreement presented has the names of Du Boren and Su Zhongqing as witnesses. Therefore, Du Boren's testimony is necessary. If the judge deems it unnecessary to take his testimony, the bail should be revoked, allowing the police to withdraw the stationed constable. After reviewing the matter, Judge Luo decided to personally visit Du's home to take his testimony. He then summoned the manager of Ruichang Foreign Firm, a Japanese national, as a witness. According to the translator, Su Sien had visited Ruichang last year and they had met once, but no transactions had taken place. The invoices presented by Su Sien were not issued by Ruichang. However, Su insisted in the presence of the witness that he had indeed had transactions with Ruichang. Judge Luo ordered Su and Wang to be remanded in custody for a continued hearing at a later date. At 2 PM, he took the court clerk, translator, and Chinese and foreign detectives in charge of the case to Du Boren's home on Datong Road to question Wang in detail about all the procedures involved in the transfer. He returned to the court after more than three hours.</p>
<h3>Murdered Male Corpse in Canal in French Concession</h3>
<p>Knife Wounds on Face and Throat</p>
<p>Strangulation Marks on Neck</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM on the day before yesterday, an unidentified male corpse was discovered in a canal next to Liu's residence on Avenue Jules Joffre in the French Concession. Children playing by the canal noticed the body and alerted villagers, who reported it to the police. The police from the Baujian Road station dispatched detectives to investigate and retrieved the body from the canal. The deceased appeared to be around 30 years old, wearing a beige undershirt and dark blue silk trousers. A white Tianjin belt was found nearby. He was bald and barefoot. There were knife wounds on his face and throat (five on the left side of the face, seven on the right, and two on the throat). There were also strangulation marks on his neck. One of his front teeth was missing. It was confirmed that he had been murdered and thrown into the canal. Since the identity of the deceased was unknown, the detectives reported the situation to the police chief and notified Tongren Fuyuantang to send staff to transport the body to the mortuary. Yesterday, Judge Zhu, from the criminal section of the French Police Department, arrived at the mortuary at 11:00 AM to examine the body and confirmed that the deceased had been murdered. He ordered photographs to be taken and instructed Tongren Fuyuantang to provide a coffin for burial and to await identification by family members. The police chief ordered all patrol officers to strictly investigate and apprehend the perpetrator. According to reports, the deceased's appearance and skin tone suggest that he was from the middle class.</p>

<h3>Impersonating Detectives to Rob Money</h3>
<p>The home of Dong Yuquan, resident of No. 17, Deyuli, Caojiadu Town, West Shanghai, was visited by three or four relatives and friends.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>They were in the middle of a game when a large man with a Jiangbei accent suddenly barged in, posing as a detective arresting gamblers. He took the small amount of money, eight dimes, and over two thousand copper coins left on the table and left. Seeing him steal the money and run, Dong and his friend Jin Alan, realizing he was an impostor, secretly followed him while reporting to the Sixth District Police Station. The police immediately dispatched officers, apprehended the thief, and recovered the stolen money. According to District Chief Duan's interrogation, the thief, Chen Jingyuan, 28 years old, from Nanjing, currently residing with a friend in Baoxingli, French Concession, claimed to be a former officer in the army who is now unemployed. He confessed to impersonating a detective to rob money and copper coins. After obtaining his confession, District Chief Duan prepared a document and transferred him to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for investigation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Abduction and Adultery of a Married Woman</h3>
<p>Wang Nie's, a 31-year-old woman from Yangzhou residing at No. 755, Xingmaoli, X'ian Road, Hongkou, had a cousin named Wang Yongcai, 20 years old, who worked as a laborer. He married a woman named Zhou (currently 22 years old) in his hometown. After the marriage, the couple lived harmoniously. Later, seeking a livelihood, Yongcai brought his wife Zhou to Shanghai to live with Nie's. However, on October 17th of last year, his wife Zhou suddenly ran away with her belongings. Nie's and Yongcai searched everywhere but could not find her. After repeated investigations, they learned that Zhou had been abducted and taken by Chen Xiaokouzi, a man from Yangzhou, for adultery. They were hiding in Wang Zhenheng's dull shop in Caojiadu Town, West Shanghai. Nie's and Yongcai went to the address on the day before yesterday, but Chen and Zhou had already left. After questioning the neighbors, they learned that Chen was at a Mr. Someone's place on Jiaxing Road. Nie's and her cousin went there, apprehended Chen Xiaokouzi, and called the police to take him to the Jiaxing Road Police Station for temporary detention. According to Chen's confession, Zhou was working at the Xinchang Silk Factory. Therefore, Nie's and her cousin went to the entrance of the Xinchang Silk Factory in Caojiadu yesterday, waited for a while, apprehended Zhou, and called the police to take her to the Sixth District Police Station. Nie's accused her cousin's wife of running away with a pair of gold bracelets, a gold ring, 30 silver dollars, 15 silver dollars in wages, and 12 pieces of clothing, and requested investigation. After questioning them separately, District Chief Duan determined that the case involved enticement, runaway, hiding, and adultery, and ordered the police to summon Zhao Jinshan, who was involved in the case. He prepared a document and transferred the case to the Local Court for investigation.</p>

<p>Problems Arising from Difficult Birth</p>
<p>Liu Zhao's, a 57-year-old woman from Yangzhou, has been running a tailoring shop at No. 2682, Longhua Road, for many years. Her son, Yuan Gao, died of illness in June of the 17th year of the Republic. Her widowed daughter-in-law, Liu Zhang's, is currently 29 years old and has a six-year-old granddaughter named Xiaoliaozi. Because she was not used to sleeping alone, she became acquainted with Tang Laosi (23 years old), a shop employee from Nanjing, last spring and became pregnant. She even ran away with him once, but Liu Zhao's did not pursue the matter. Recently, Zhang's was about to give birth and experienced severe abdominal pain. She was unable to deliver the baby and died on the morning of the 28th at 2:00 AM. Zhang Zhao's, the deceased's mother, upon hearing the news, gathered a crowd and destroyed all the belongings in Liu Zhao's home, claiming that the deceased had been forcibly fed ginger soup by Liu Zhao's, leading to her death. Liu Zhao's had no choice but to report the matter to the branch station in the town. Patrol Officer Jia Pengfei briefly questioned them. According to Zhang Zhao's, the deceased's mother, 61 years old, from Gaoyou, residing at No. 30, Yaogou, behind Longhua Town, her daughter Liu Zhang's was forcibly fed ginger soup by Liu Zhao's, causing her to develop a fever and die. Patrol Officer Jia deemed the case serious and instructed the local bailiff, Hu Zhusheng, to accompany Zhang Zhao's, the deceased's mother, to the Local Court for an examination yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Abuse of Wife Proven</h3>
<p>Wang Lanying, a female member of the local party, was previously controlled by her old-fashioned family and married to Huang Amao of the Sanjing Coal Yard in Pudong. Amao was addicted to smoking and gambling, which caused the family to be unable to afford to live. Wang Lanying has been working outside for four years, supporting herself. Recently, because of unemployment, she returned home for food, but there was no grain left, and almost everything had been pawned. Because of a meal, she was injured twice by Huang Amao. Wang Lanying felt that she had married the wrong person and resented her husband's unfair treatment. Therefore, she filed a case with the Local Court to examine her injuries. At yesterday's hearing, Wang Lanying recounted the previous events and requested punishment to uphold women's rights and maintain humanity. Wang Lanying's mother testified that her son-in-law smoked opium and often abused her daughter, abandoning her for four years and never visiting her parents' home, which was truly unconscionable. When questioned, the defendant Huang Amao admitted that he had indeed hit her, but it was mutual fighting. When the judge asked if he had any injuries since it was mutual fighting, the defendant said no. The judge asked if he smoked opium, and the defendant replied that he used to, but now he swallows pills. The judge concluded that the defendant's abuse of his wife had been proven and ordered him to be detained and await punishment.</p>
<h3>Kneeling to Confess Guilt</h3>
<p>Wang Xiqi is a Thief in the Family</p>
<p>Wang Xiqi, from Shou County, Anhui, residing at No. 6, Dengyunli, Rehe Road, Zhabei,</p>
<p>had a monthly income of one hundred yuan. He had been living with Dong Guiying (24 years old), a woman from Yancheng residing at No. 396, Shunzhen Road, for many years, as if they were a married couple. Recently, Guiying's elder sister, He Dong's, had just arrived in Shanghai from her hometown for medical treatment and was staying with her sister. Wang saw that He Dong's was more attractive than Guiying and wanted to take advantage of her. One night, while He Dong's was asleep, Wang snuck into her bed and attempted to commit indecent acts. He Dong's screamed for a thief, waking Guiying, who lit a lamp and saw that it was her lover. Guiying sternly rebuked him, and Wang became enraged, grabbing Guiying and beating her severely. The commotion lasted until dawn, when Guiying's father took Wang to the Fourth District Police Station to file a complaint. After Police Chief Ni interrogated him, Wang, realizing his misconduct, willingly kneeled to confess his guilt to He. Guiying's father then bailed Wang out, closing the case.</p>

<h3>Embezzled Over 15,000 Yuan in Private Funds</h3>
<p>Guilty of Embezzlement</p>
<p>Two Years in West Jail</p>
<p>Fan Buzhou, an employee of the French Banque Franco-Chinoise, had embezzled over 15,300 yuan in private funds since last year. After the case was discovered, he fled to Tongzhou. The plaintiff learned of his whereabouts and hired a lawyer to obtain a warrant from the French Court. The warrant was given to the police, who dispatched detective Mao Jinsheng to Tongzhou to arrest Fan and bring him to Shanghai. He was brought to the court to await further review. He was summoned again the day before yesterday. The plaintiff's lawyer reiterated the previous events and stated that the defendant's embezzlement had been established, requesting severe punishment and the recovery of the embezzled funds. When questioned, Fan Buzhou claimed that he was deceived by others and was instructed by friends to open the Xinhua Silk Factory, which led to continuous losses. He did not waste any of the funds for his personal use and begged for mercy. The Chinese and foreign judges ruled that the defendant's embezzlement had been proven and ordered him to be imprisoned in West Jail for two years, to be deported upon completion of his sentence, and to reimburse the plaintiff for the embezzled funds.</p>

<h3>Robbers of Goods Discovered on Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway</h3>
<p>At 8:10 PM the night before last, the 24th freight train from Shanghai to Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was approaching the first barrier when it was noticed that several thieves were boarding the train to steal goods. Wang Bucai and Su Yaodong, the railway police officers on the train, saw a package of goods left on the tracks. They, along with the train conductor, blew the whistle and signaled a red light to stop the train. However, because the train had twenty-one freight cars, the signal was too far from the locomotive to be noticed. At that time, two thieves jumped off the train. The police officers fired sixteen shots, but the freight train continued straight on. It was not until it reached Longhua that the Longhua station master lowered the flag to signal a stop. The Longhua station master immediately telephoned the Nanshi Police Department. Huang Renjie, the police chief, along with Deputy Chief Jian Huanluan, led several police officers to investigate along the railway tracks from the Nanshi station at 8:15 PM. They found a package of dried cocoons near the tracks outside the barrier. Upon reaching the Longhua station and inspecting the freight cars, they found that two packages of dried cocoons were missing. Because gunshots were fired at the time, members of the 11th Brigade of the Security Corps, who were on patrol, rushed to the scene and found two packages of dried cocoons on the railway track outside the barrier. They took the packages to the headquarters of the 11th Brigade for safekeeping. It was determined that the dried cocoons were being transported to Hangzhou by the Shanghai Baoji Transport Company. After inspecting the remaining goods, it was found that nothing else was missing. A suspect, Pei Jinrong, was apprehended at the outer flag location and taken to the police department for questioning in preparation for strictly apprehending the runaway goods robbers. A letter was also sent to the 11th Brigade of the Security Corps to retrieve the lost dried cocoons.</p>

<p>The association is currently trying to raise funds and transport grain for relief.</p>
<h3>Street Vendors and Small Merchants Telegraph the Entire Country to Jointly Fight for Organization</h3>
<p>Over thirty groups of street vendors and brokers in this city yesterday telegraphed the National Association of Merchants and People, Street Vendors Federation of various provinces, special municipalities, counties, and cities, and jointly fought for organization with the Central Government. The telegram stated: "To the Street Vendors Federation of the National Association of Merchants and People of various provinces, special municipalities, counties, and cities: Street vendors and brokers are a type of commerce. To seek the interests of the same industry and increase the happiness of the same industry, it is natural to gather the same industry to organize groups. However, reading the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's interpretation of the Organizational Law of Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, there is a clear decision that street vendors, brokers, and mobile merchants are not allowed to organize trade associations according to law. This rejects street vendors and brokers outside of legitimate merchants, making it impossible to organize groups. We were deeply disturbed upon hearing this. We have united various groups and telegraphed the reasons to appeal for assistance, and approval is pending. However, the Law on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations and the Law on Chambers of Commerce have been decided by the Central Government and promulgated by the National Government, and there is no way to change them. Small businesses such as street vendors and brokers must also gather into groups to protect the welfare of the same industry. To fundamentally avoid conflicts between laws and facts, the only way is to request the Central Government to formulate a separate set of regulations for street vendors, brokers, and all mobile merchants to show thoroughness and provide relief. However, this matter is significant and we ask your association to uphold the slogan of supporting small businesses and provide assistance in the same boat. We unanimously fight for this with the Central Government so that small merchants can be protected and the future of commerce can benefit from it. Sincerely, the Joint Office of Over Thirty Groups of Street Vendors and Brokers of Shanghai Special Municipality."</p>
<h3>Reply from the Accumulated Surplus Company</h3>
<p>In the case of Fu Jucun of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company suing Li Guojie, Special Commissioner Li entrusted lawyer Li Shirui to draft a reply. The reply stated: Regarding the plaintiff's request for transfer, this is the reply. We respectfully present the facts and reasons of this case as follows: (1) The history and nature of the Accumulated Surplus Company: The Accumulated Surplus Property Company was established on the 21st day of the first month of the lunar calendar in the third year of the Republic of China, following a resolution of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company shareholders' meeting. Its capital of 4.4 million yuan was divided into 44,000 shares, each worth 100 yuan. 40,000 yuan was allocated to shareholders as public reserve shares, and 400,000 yuan was allocated to former executives of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company as public bonus shares. This was approved by a telegram from the Ministry of Transportation in Beijing. At the time, the board of directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company followed the aforementioned resolution and issued share certificates separately. They also formulated articles of association (copy of the articles of association listed as evidence No. 1), which detailed the establishment process and operating regulations. An office was established, and staff were selected. Operations commenced on January 30th of the third year of the Republic of China, which was the fifth day of the first month of the lunar calendar, Jia Yin year. All properties were inspected and taken over, and records were kept. Article 3 of the articles of association stipulated that, in accordance with the shareholders' meeting resolution, the board of directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company would continue to serve concurrently, with the chairman bearing full responsibility. However, a manager was to be appointed to reside permanently at the company. Over the years, the board of directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company selected and dispatched managers in accordance with the plan, and the chairman of the board was fully responsible. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the National Government promulgated regulations for the supervision of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (copy listed as evidence No. 2). In the seventeenth year, the supervisory office promulgated provisional rules for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (copy listed as evidence No. 3). At the same time, a general management office was established to carry out business operations. However, a majority of the directors and supervisors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were investigated and dealt with, and were ordered to suspend their duties. The powers of the board of directors were then vested in the chairman of the board (i.e., the defendant) by the provisional rules. At that time, the position of manager of the Accumulated Surplus Company was vacant. According to the company's articles of association, the board of directors should select and dispatch a replacement. However, since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was under the supervision regulations, it was appropriate to inform the supervisor in advance about this important matter. After repeated consultations, Supervisor Wang Boqun issued a commission on March 6th of the seventeenth year, ordering the defendant to serve concurrently as chairman of the board and manager (copy of the commission listed as No. 4). After the defendant accepted the commission, the general management office used its power to interfere in everything and drafted so-called provisional rules for the Accumulated Surplus Company, forcing the defendant to sign and agree. Afterwards, the defendant, in his capacity as a representative of the shareholders, accepted the appointment from the government and made concessions to the government, which was criticized by the shareholders. Even at the recent shareholders' meeting, this criticism had not ceased (shareholder Li Gufan's announcement listed as evidence No. 5). The defendant, having no other choice, on the one hand, rectified the company's operations, and on the other hand, submitted a report to the special municipal government, which was then forwarded to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting approval for registration and the issuance of a license. On May 25th of the eighteenth year, the Social Affairs Bureau of the special municipal government informed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that it had approved the prior registration and issuance of a license, and ordered that articles of association be drafted, directors and supervisors be elected, a shareholder register be compiled, and that these matters be submitted for record in accordance with the law (copy of the approval order listed as evidence No. 6). After receiving the aforementioned approval order, the defendant received the company registration certificate No. 58 of the third category issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (photocopy of the certificate listed as evidence No. 7). He then reported the registration and licensing situation to the Supervision Office of the Ministry of Transportation, requesting approval for record. On July 1st of the eighteenth year, Supervisor Wang Boqun issued instruction No. 91, stating that the report and attachments had been received and noted. Since the company had been registered and issued a license by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, approval for record was granted (original instruction listed as evidence No. 8). The defendant then complied with the instructions of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce by carrying out shareholder registration and preparing for the drafting of articles of association and the election of directors and supervisors, in order to submit for record in accordance with the law. At the same time, due to the company's accumulated debt of over 1.1 million in shareholder interest, it was proposed to convert the owed amount into interest shares, increase the number of shares, and distribute them to shareholders, changing the company's capital from 4.4 million yuan to 5.5 million yuan. After the plan was drafted, it was submitted to Supervisor Wang for approval, which was also approved, but with the stipulation that it must be approved by the shareholders' meeting to ensure credibility (copy of the approval order listed as evidence No. 9). The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Limited, managed by merchants, was issued a separate license by the National Registration Bureau (photocopy listed as evidence No. 10). Based on this detailed historical review, the following definitions can be derived for the Accumulated Surplus Company: (1) The Accumulated Surplus Company is a property company established by a resolution of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company shareholders' meeting and approved by the former Ministry of Transportation in Beijing. (2) The Accumulated Surplus Company is a property limited company registered and licensed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government and approved for record by the Ministry of Transportation. It is distinctly separate from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Limited, managed by merchants. (3) The capital of the Accumulated Surplus Property Company Limited is comprised of the accumulated undistributed public reserve funds of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company shareholders and its former and current executives, with absolutely no government shares involved. (2) The relationship between the Accumulated Surplus Company and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, managed by merchants, is a shipping limited company with a capital of 8.4 million taels of silver (refer to evidence No. 10). The capital of the Accumulated Surplus Company is made up of the dividends accumulated and undistributed to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company shareholders and its former and current executives. It has a parent-child relationship with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Furthermore, due to the shareholders' meeting resolution, the directors and supervisors to be elected by the Accumulated Surplus Company should be concurrently held by the board of directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Moreover, Article 36 of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's articles of association states: "This company is entrusted by the Accumulated Surplus Company to act as its agent for all matters of the Accumulated Surplus Property Company, with a dedicated manager in charge, supervised by the board of directors" (printed copy of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's articles of association listed as evidence No. 11). Therefore, it has a relationship of entrustment and agency with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The inherent parent-child relationship has become a thing of the past. The subsequent relationship of entrustment and agency will continue until the Accumulated Surplus Company holds a shareholders' meeting and elects directors and supervisors, without ever being terminated. However, regarding the relationship of entrustment and agency, there are two points that must be solemnly declared: (1) The entrusting party is the shareholder holding shares in the Accumulated Surplus Company. (2) The entrusted agent is the board of directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. (3) The relationship between the Accumulated Surplus Company and the defendant: The defendant was elected as the chairman of the board of directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China. According to the articles of association of the Accumulated Surplus Company, he should bear full responsibility for the company's operations (refer to evidence No. 1). After the seventeenth year, he exercised the powers of the board of directors and was responsible for selecting and supervising the manager of the company (refer to evidence No. 1, No. 11, Article 36). After accepting the commission from Supervisor Wang Boqun to serve concurrently as chairman of the board and manager, he was also responsible for managing the company's operations. After receiving the order from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce approving registration and issuing a license, he was also responsible for preparing to draft articles of association, elect directors and supervisors, compile a shareholder register, and submit for record (refer to evidence No. 6). After Supervisor Wang Boqun issued an instruction to distribute interest shares, subject to approval by the shareholders' meeting, he was also responsible for convening a shareholders' meeting (refer to evidence No. 9). From accepting the supervisor's commission to holding the shareholders' meeting, he has been accused by shareholders of depriving them of their rights, and has the responsibility to maintain the company's position and its interests on behalf of all shareholders. (4) The right to appoint the manager of the Accumulated Surplus Company: Since the Accumulated Surplus Company is a limited company with entirely commercial shares, the right to appoint its manager naturally belongs to the board of directors, according to the company ordinance and the company law. Before the Accumulated Surplus Company has a board of directors, it should belong to the concurrently serving and acting board of directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, according to the articles of association of the Accumulated Surplus Company and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. In the thirteenth and sixteenth years of the Republic of China, the selection of managers and the filling of manager vacancies were carefully discussed and resolved by the board of directors (copy of the minutes of the thirteenth year listed as evidence No. 11, minutes of the sixteenth year listed as evidence No. 13). (To be continued)</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>To the Editor: I recently read an article in the local news section of today's newspaper about the recovery of water and electricity rights on North Sichuan Road, which stated that Japanese people were being hired as collectors. Our company's employees are all of Chinese nationality, and there is no plan to hire Japanese people as collectors. I believe the report is based on inaccurate rumors. I request that you publish this letter of correction. Sincerely, Zhabei Water and Electricity Co., Ltd., March 29th.</p>

<h3>Historical Film of the Yellow Flower Festival</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>March 29th is a major anniversary commemorating the seventy-two martyrs who died in Guangzhou nineteen years ago, and also the tenth failed revolution of the late Premier. Its history is worthy of being compared with the suicide of Emperor Chongzhen of Ming on Coal Hill on March 19th, and both will endure eternally. The heroic souls on Yellow Flower Hill are especially worthy of remembrance and sighs, which one cannot help but feel.</p>
<p>Yellow Flower Hill is located about fifteen li north of Guangzhou, at the foot of Baiyun Mountain. It was originally called Red Flower Hill. Therefore, Pan Dawei, who buried the martyrs, wrote the line, "New ghosts in front of the Advisory Bureau, party members' monument on Red Flower Hill." Later, the sound of "red" was deemed less great and heroic than "yellow," and since the Cantonese pronunciation of "red" and "yellow" are the same, the character "yellow" was used instead. Thus, the three characters "Yellow Flower Hill" now shine together with Baiyun Mountain on the earth.</p>
<p>Previously, it was said that disasters in Guangdong must occur in years ending in "9." Therefore, after March 29th, Sun Wu, Xiong Bingkun, Cai Jimin, etc., bombed the Governor-General's office on August 19th, thus establishing the foundation for the Republic of China. Although this theory is not believed by the wise, it is consistent with the historical disasters of Guangdong. Those who participated in the revolution at the time were also encouraged by this, and this is why they were able to take up arms and bravely advance to the death. At that time, there was a so-called "mute party member" named Cheng Liang. After being arrested, he was severely interrogated by General Li Zhun. Although he was beaten severely, he did not say a word, only asking for a quick death. He was eventually executed. Zhao Sheng, also known as Zhao Bosheng, was the most famous of the battle. He was originally from Dantu County in Jiangsu, and had served as a battalion commander in Nanjing. Later, he was suspected by a powerful official and had to resign. Upon arriving in Guangdong, he became a battalion commander in the New Army again, but was resented by the Guangdong Governor Zhang Mingqi. He fled to Japan. When he returned, he participated in the battle. It was said that he and Huang Keqiang escaped from the city after their defeat, but others criticized Bosheng, saying that he entered Guangdong from Hong Kong. It was heard from a certain woman that there was an agent of the Qing court in the party and that the provincial capital was already on alert, so he came slightly later, not because he was retreating. Although Bosheng died with resentment and was not among the seventy-two heroes, his name is particularly prominent because he personally received instructions from Premier Sun Yat-sen's residence in Penang. Therefore, his task was above those of Hu Yisheng and Deng Zeru. Thus, although Zhao died later, he was still a vanguard in the bloody ranks of corpses, so he is specially mentioned.</p>
<h3>Strange Tales from the Mountain Market</h3>
<p>— Zong Shuo</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jihe of Hefei has recently written "One Hundred Odes to Tiger Hill," each with annotations. He had them typeset, printed, and distributed to friends. I also received a copy. Several people wrote inscriptions at the beginning of the volume. Mr. Gu Yilan wrote two seven-character quatrains. The annotation to the second one says, "In the spring of the Ji Si year, I and Dong Xiaochen and other gentlemen were touring the Sword Pond on Tiger Hill. Suddenly, in a dangerous pavilion with four corners, we saw a stone tablet, five or six feet high, engraved with the three characters 'Ke Zhong Pavilion,' each larger than a foot. We quickly called our fellow travelers to look, but it had disappeared. Later, we asked Mr. Li Boqi about it. Mr. Li said, 'Ancient books mention mountain markets. Could this be it?'" Mr. Gu's second poem is also recorded below: "I once visited the scenic spot of Tiger Hill; the illusory traces I met seemed preordained. I must have had a past connection with the spirit of the mountain; the desolate pavilion of Ke Zhong suddenly appeared." Mr. Li is living in Wumen and can be visited. I don't yet know the location of Mr. Gu's residence.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Gathering at the Qie Lu Studio</h3>
<p>— Xi Yan Chong Lai Ke</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, I attended a dinner party at my friend Meng Yiyu's Qie Lu Studio. The host invited guests by sending letters three days in advance, attached with conditions. When the time came, there were only five people, including the host. The organization of the dinner party was unique, and everything during the meal was worth recording. The so-called Qie Lu Studio is located in the midst of the hustle and bustle, but it is not adjacent to vulgar and narrow things. The guests were very happy and asked me to record it. The most important of the conditions was that each guest, after receiving the letter, had to order two dishes, specifying the method of cooking, and immediately reply by mail. The host would prepare the ingredients according to the list and order the family members to make it according to the method. The second important thing was that each guest also had to bring a bottle of wine. If one arrived after the scheduled time, exceeding the legal limit of twenty minutes, the cost of the food and drinks for that day would be borne solely by that guest. If one arrived too early, arriving more than an hour before the scheduled time, one would also be responsible for 40% of the expenses. One would be exempt if one could enter the kitchen and be a helpful assistant. At 5:00 PM that afternoon, all the guests arrived. No one dared to be early or late. Only one person arrived five minutes early. The effectiveness of the agreement was that it corrected the bad habit of arriving late for dinner parties. This is one thing worth recording. The wine was nothing more than Gaoliang and Huadiao. The dishes were nothing more than chicken, fish, duck, and meat, but the flavors were all delicious. The wine was not forced on anyone. One guest, a lady, had a particularly large capacity. The wine she brought was top-quality brandy. The bottle was empty, but the meal was not even half over. She continued to chat eloquently, not overwhelmed by the wine. The rest of us were also able to enjoy ourselves and stop when we had had enough. There were no loud noises, finger-wrestling, or gambling over drinks. This is the second thing worth recording. The Qie Lu Studio is a new three-story building. The host wrote the four characters "Qie Zhu Wei Jia" ("Live for the Moment") on a horizontal plaque and hung it in the middle. On the left wall were paintings and calligraphy by famous Chinese people, and on the right were oil paintings of new art, hung with mirrors. The host and hostess were both over thirty years old, and their demeanor was elegant. They had three children, all of whom were well-behaved. The youngest was only six years old and was not naughty. The people and the studio were all like a freshly written Huang Ting Sutra, just right. This is the third thing worth recording. When the wine was flowing, it was discovered that one of the guests had not ordered any dishes in advance, but had brought canned food. The host was going to punish him, but because the agreement did not say that canned food was prohibited, he was asked to tell a story to accompany the wine. The guest said that ten years ago, an old man in He County, Anhui Province, was celebrating his birthday. His cousin secretly brought a can of shad and went into the kitchen to steam it and offer it to him. The guests were surprised because it was very cold at the time, and some neighbors even suspected that it was Lu Dongbin playing a trick. The story, though humorous, shows that it is not easy to civilize the countryside. I have therefore attached a record of it. The name of this guest is Zhang Shangda, from Liuhe. The lady wine guest is Cheng Huang Yuying, from Wu County. The hostess Meng Youhuang and the host are both from Jingjiang.</p>
<h3>Further Discussions on Pufferfish</h3>
<p>— Wang Mei</p>
<p>I read Mr. Jue Mi's research on pufferfish, in which he compiled information from various books on the types and names of pufferfish, adding detailed annotations. This could not be done without extensive knowledge. I have never eaten this fish, but I dare to offer what I have heard and seen to the world. Readers, please take Mr. Jue Mi as the warp and me as the weft, secretly taking the meaning of transmission. According to what I have heard, pufferfish is delicious but very poisonous. Between the years of Ji You and Geng Xu, I was stationed in Jiangyin. The gentry and farmers competed to offer it as a gift. I accepted it, but dared not taste it. Later, I visited Peach Blossom Harbor and heard villagers talking, saying that a few days ago, a boat from north of the Yangtze River was docked outside the harbor. On the boat were six people: a husband, a wife, a son, and three daughters. The eldest daughter, who was ten years old, caught a glimpse of fake shrimp laid out neatly on a neighboring boat in the scorching sun. She said to her mother, "There's no one on that boat. We can grab them!" The ignorant villagers of northern Jiangsu often covet small gains. The mother and daughter collected the shrimp from the neighboring boat and rowed their boat away. The next day, all six people were found dead on the boat, with no one spared. After obtaining the shrimp, they cooked noodles and ate them heartily. The whole family ate their fill. At midnight, the neighboring boat heard screams. They got up and saw them writhing and tossing, dying one after another. In the darkness of the night, they could only watch helplessly, not knowing what disease they had. Later, they saw unwashed bowls and dishes, still with fish roe stuck to them. They realized that they had been poisoned by pufferfish roe. The boatman who was drying the fish roe was also wondering what he had lost. Since they were not far apart, the events coincided. Later, I went to Huangshan and saw villagers eating pufferfish from house to house. I was astonished. An old man said, "The oilseed rape seeds are swelling. But if you cook the oil until day and night, and cook the fish roe for six hours, the oil will not be oily, and the swelling property of the roe will be sufficient, so it will not be poisonous and will be very delicious." He then lifted the lid of the pot to show me. Each fish roe was as large as a soybean. He also said that if you cook it for only one hour, and then eat countless fish roe in one meal, without any cooking, it will swell in the abdomen. How can it not cause the intestines to be severed? Also, there is an ancient saying that if you are born in the year of the Rabbit, eating pufferfish will definitely cause death. Rabbit is wood. Wood belongs to the liver. This coincides with Mr. Jue Mi's statement that the liver is the most poisonous. But Tiger is also wood. Why only fear the Rabbit? There are many beautiful women in the world. Why must it be this one? I also say the same about pufferfish. It is also said that pufferfish should be cooked in an open area. If it gets any dust, it will kill people, no matter how it is prepared. Yet those who love it throughout the ages have even expressed it in poetry. Do they know that great beauty must have evil?</p>
<p>Short News: The Bayi Ya Ji, organized by Nie Shaoxuan, Wei Fusun, and others, was established not long ago and has achieved excellent results. It has now been decided to hold a day and night of color opera performances at the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association on Xizang Road on April 6th of the Gregorian calendar to commemorate the event. It is said that the program includes the complete "Visiting Mother" and the complete "Qionglin Banquet," both of which are very challenging. There are also several erhu amateur players who will also participate in the performance.</p>
<p>Hong Qushu</p>
<h3>Random Musings on Xun Huisheng's Visit to the South</h3>
<p>— Chong Liang</p>
<p>It has been about two years since Xun Huisheng returned north in glory after performing at the Tianchan Theatre. During that time, the "Three Great Female Dan" – Lanfang, Yanqiu, and Xiaoyun – came to Shanghai one after another to showcase their talents. Last winter, Lanfang was about to tour the United States, there were rumors that Yanqiu was contemplating a career change due to being restricted to supporting roles in her troupe, and Xiaoyun's visit south was unsuccessful, and she was unwilling to repeat the experience. These three famous "Golden Stars" were all unlikely to come to Shanghai in the near future, and the Spring Metropolis's opera scene was on the verge of becoming desolate. The Great Stage (Da Wu Tai) opportunely engaged Xun Huisheng, the famous "Golden Star" female Dan, at this time, and Shanghai's opera circles immediately took on a vibrant atmosphere. Therefore, insightful people had already predicted that Huisheng's trip would be a great success.</p>
<p>The Great Stage originally signed a one-month contract with Huisheng, and later requested an extension of half a month. Including benefit performances and half-month New Year's Day performances, the total engagement was for about eighty days. It is rare for a performer to have their contract extended for such a long period at the request of the theatre owner. (Characteristic 1) Despite the long engagement, the theatre was able to maintain full houses throughout. (Characteristic 2) However, the reason for the enduring popularity was the constant introduction of new plays. Among the new plays, there must be several signature pieces to ensure continued success. Huisheng had as many as four such plays: "Yutang Chun," "Thirteen Sisters," "The Fortunate Marriage," and "The Spider Cave." (Characteristic 3) This can be considered truly commendable.</p>
<p>The supporting actors that Huisheng brought were extremely well-organized, with Meirong Cao being the most outstanding. Her acting is meticulous, and she excels in both Qingyi (virtuous woman) and Huadan (vivacious young woman) roles. Her portrayal of the Second Madam in "The Fortunate Marriage" and Zhang Jinfeng in "Thirteen Sisters" greatly enhanced Huisheng's performance. Ma Fulu's clown roles are good in well-written scripts, but he sometimes deviates from the script and loses discipline. However, he also has some drawing power. Jin Zhongren's young male roles are much better than Wang Youquan's weak performance and Jiang Miaoxiang's effeminate portrayal. His portrayal of An Gongzi, the bookish idiot, in "Thirteen Sisters" is a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Last week, Huisheng was hired by Great China Gramophone Company to record six records. The selections were from "Yutang Chun" (from the scene where she opens her heart at sixteen to the scene where she steals the silver and returns to Nanjing, which, when combined with Huisheng's "Yutang Chun" recorded for Beka, Pathe, and Gaoting, can form a complete "Three Trials"). "Visiting Relatives and Quarrelling" (the entire play, with Fulu playing the clownish female role), "Thirteen Sisters" (the dialogue from the "Bow and Inkstone Affair," with Fulu playing the four-sentence painted face), "The Auspicious Wedding" (the dialogue from the honeymoon beating scene), "Mount Cuiping" (the Nanbangzi aria with dialogue from the "Leaving the Camp" scene), and "Drunkenness" (the two segments of "Receiving the Emperor" and "Teasing Pei Lishi"). The test pressings were made the next day. Huisheng listened to them and highly praised Great China's advanced recording technology. Mr. Shu Sheyu (Lao She) is a rare and valuable friend of Huisheng. Huisheng respects him as a teacher. The people in the Xun Troupe also care for Huisheng with utmost devotion. Huisheng's achieving such wonderful results now means that their efforts have not been wasted.</p>
<h3>Heart's Warmth (159)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Fiery Flames Ascend, Brothel Adores Filial Daughter; Red Carpet Lies, Impromptu Meeting with Famous Actors</p>
<p>Ruiyun had just returned and was immediately told, "A'nan, that photo you took with so many people at the racetrack the other day has been brought back by Second Master Shi." Ruiyun changed her clothes while saying, "Bring it here, let me see. Didn't I take a bad picture?" Hanyun said, "Not at all. It looks very natural and freehand." Ruiyun moved the photo under the electric light. Naturally, she looked at herself first. After looking, she didn't say anything. Then she started commenting on others, saying that someone's face was turned to the side, and someone wasn't standing well. Zuo Shichen thought, "If she doesn't say anything about herself, it means she must be satisfied. If she were unhappy with how she looked, she would have started complaining, saying what's wrong and what's not good, and she would definitely argue with me, even though she knows I didn't take the picture. As for commenting on others, that shows that there's nothing to criticize about herself." He felt as if a weight had been lifted from his heart. On ordinary days, she would have been very excited, especially since Zuo Shichen had brought the photo, and she was also happy with how she looked in it. She would definitely discuss what kind of frame to put it in and where to hang it – in the boudoir, or in the pavilion room, or perhaps she would start another round of small mahjong or card games, because it wasn't too late in the day. But today, she didn't seem very excited. After looking at the photo, she put it back in the paper envelope, asked A Jin to put it in the wardrobe, and prepared to eat porridge. She also asked Zuo Shichen, "Are you hungry? Would you like some porridge too? But there aren't any side dishes." Zuo Shichen said, "You eat, I'm not hungry." Ruiyun said, "Second Master Shi is sending a copy to everyone, that's quite a few copies." Zuo Shichen said, "He sent twelve copies to twelve people, and printed several extra copies." Zuo Shichen felt that she wasn't very enthusiastic. Remembering that A Jin was her chief aide, he asked her when she went inside to wash her face after eating porridge, "A'nan seems a bit listless today. What's the reason?" A Jin said, "Didn't she argue with her mother?" Shichen said, "Ah? What about?" A Jin said, "A guest with the surname Ye wanted A'nan to see a play. A'nan was naturally very happy and agreed. But she didn't tell Great Aunt. Great Aunt wasn't very happy, saying that if you go to see a play all night, you'll have to give a large share of the proceeds. She wanted Hanyun and Fengyun to go in your place, but the guests wouldn't be happy. Some even returned their tickets, writing on them, 'Don't come if Ruiyun isn't coming.' Wouldn't that offend Master Ye? Now that you've agreed, you should go to the theater at nine o'clock to make an appearance, then leave immediately. If the star players are scheduled to perform early, then go again at half past eleven." A'nan wasn't happy, saying, "Half past eleven? The theater will be empty by then. Am I going to see empty seats? People are kindly inviting me to see a play, I'm ruining their show. I might as well refuse them altogether."</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Speculation Continues to Increase</h3>
<p>Strong Buying Interest Pushes Prices Higher: Gold prices increased even more sharply yesterday, but market conditions were quite calm. Industry attitudes remained relatively stable, with only a two-tael difference during the morning. Buyers were in the majority. Companies such as Fuchang, Yuancheng Yong, and Yuansheng all made further purchases. However, Taixing sold off a significant amount. Both official and unofficial foreign exchange rates were tight, and some in the industry were already scrambling to cover positions. Morning long bars were initially lower, opening high but then declining by more than one or two taels due to large sellers. Subsequently, buyers remained active, foreign exchange rates strengthened, and prices rose again, exceeding 503 taels. Later, there were slight fluctuations, with the price at 503 taels and change at noon. Recent UK gold futures settled at 11 pence and 125 points, with deferred settlements at 25. East Asian exchange rates for recent contracts were purchased at 1.05625 taels, but the market subsequently weakened due to the Saturday market closure.</p>

The opening price for gold for May settlement was 502 taels and 6 mace, an increase of 1 tael and 7 mace. Gross margins decreased from 3 taels and 2 mace to 1 tael and 7 mace, likely due to speculative selling. Bills of exchange remained stable.

<p>Closing Price Up 2 Taels and 3 Mace From Previous Day: After entering the market, there were several qian of fluctuations.

The noon closing price was 503 taels and 2 qian, up 2 taels and 3 qian compared to the 28th. The highest price in the morning was 03 taels and 7 qian, and the lowest price was 01 taels and 7 qian, a difference of 2 taels. The list price was changed to 512 taels and 4 qian, because the Japanese yen increased by a large half fen, initially suppressing the price by slightly more than 10 taels, and later by about 9 taels. The noon closing price was calculated at a discount of 9 taels and change, with both book entries and top-up water at 503 taels.

<h3>Weekend Silver and Foreign Coin Market is Silent Again</h3>
<p>Foreign cents advanced two fen into customs… Silver loan is free.</p>
<p>Market Overview: The silver and foreign coin market mood was quite strong in previous days due to demand from securities settlements and customer purchases. However, yesterday afternoon, it suddenly became silent again. In addition, it was also Saturday, and banks closed in the afternoon as usual, making the atmosphere even more bleak. The price of loan interest immediately fell, and silver loans were even free.</p>
<p>Loan Interest Price (Foreign Cents): The morning market was 7 qian 1 fen 9 li 8 hao 7 si half. It seemed to advance two fen into customs again. The afternoon market had few transactions, and the market price remained the same and did not change.

<h3>Securities: Dismissal Customs Tariffs Increased Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot trading of public bonds turned clear, while the futures market remained strong, with active buying and selling and a continued good market outlook. Regarding changes in the prices of various bonds, 7-year 96 bonds had little change due to infrequent trading. The trends of other bonds were relatively peaceful when they opened in the morning. In the second session, buying interest suddenly increased, and the supply-demand gap was large. Customs tariffs and dismissals rose rapidly. The upward trend had not slowed by the time the market opened in the afternoon, and it only eased when the market closed. As a result, compared with before settlement, dismissal futures rose by as much as 2.34 yuan, customs tariffs rose by about 1 yuan, and other bonds rose by only about 5 or 6 jiao. Statistics show that only 14,000 yuan of spot goods were traded throughout the day, and 8 million yuan of futures were traded. Customs tariffs accounted for the largest amount, about 3.5 million yuan. The remaining funds, such as 1.3 million yuan for rehabilitation, more than 1 million yuan for dismissals, and other funds were clearer.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: A Brief Account of the Settlement of Yarn and Cotton Speculation</h3>
<p>Yarn Volume: 7,750 Bales</p>
<p>Cotton Volume: 7,700 Packages</p>
<p>People's Speculative Settlement Price 152 Taels: At the beginning of the month, speculation on three-month yarn prices was calm. A certain manufacturer had a strong attitude and did not sell the goods taken in during February, so the market was very strong. Prices hovered between 55 and 56 taels. After the 10th, the demand from Tianjin and Qingdao increased, and the volume of packages was huge, which slightly improved morale. It once reached 158 taels. Before long, actual sales stagnated, rumors about the situation spread, and the inventory of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn and 10-count coarse yarn in warehouses was very large, sales were stagnant, and the inventory of various factories gradually increased, and the market situation was quite weak. Around the 20th, sellers searched for spot yarn outside, about 6,500 bales, and most of them were Five Blessings Shepherd yarn. Therefore, the bull market of a certain manufacturer was also uneasy. In view of the fact that there were about 27,000 or 28,000 bales of goods in yarn and cloth warehouses, the surplus was sold off to close the position, with no intention of taking delivery. The market suddenly loosened, and the lowest price fell to 150 taels and 2 qian. Later, the market slightly stabilized due to the purchase and receipt of goods by the seller, and then rose by another 2 taels. As a result, the settlement price was 152 taels, totaling 7,750 packages. The types of goods were 20-count Shepherd yarn 1,950 packages, Five Blessings 1,950 packages, 10-count Deli 150 packages, Bao Yi 500 packages, and the remaining 3,250 packages were settled independently. The recipients were all short sellers. The two firms 36 and 17 were the largest deliverers. The names of the brokers and the number of packages are listed below.</p>

<p>Han Speculative Settlement Price 25 taels: The monthly cotton price in March hovered around 35 taels. Because of the shortage of goods, Hankou was expensive, so the Han Gang tightened and did not let go. There was quite a squeeze atmosphere, so the market was firm. Later, the US cotton market tended to fall, and morale was slightly tired, and the price fell slightly. It once saw 34 taels 3 qian 5 fen. Before long, US cotton rebounded by 100 pounds, and the situation became tighter. The buyer's attitude was very strong, and retailers saw that the general trend was good. There was a lack of delivery, and those who were short sold were eager to buy, and the market suddenly rose, and the highest price once reached 35 taels 7 qian. Then, on the last round of trading at the end of the month, there was a sudden drop of 7 qian 5 fen, to 34 taels 5 qian. Because the major buyer had no intention of taking delivery, it suddenly fell. As a result, the settlement price was 35 taels, and the settlement amount was 7,700 bales, totaling 269,500 taels. A considerable portion of it was settled independently. The settled goods included Fire Machine, Taicang, and Ben Cotton. The two firms 2 and 102 were the largest deliverers, and firm 1 was the only large receiver. The brokers and package volumes of the receiving and delivery parties are listed below.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of Spot Yarn and Cotton on Settlement Day</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still sluggish. Actual sales are exceptionally quiet. Due to futures settlement, spot yarn transactions are even rarer. Statistics show that all gangs bought only 115 packages throughout the day. The Tianjin gang bought 250 futures packages, and colleagues bought 70 packages. Prices fell by 5 qian. Customer gangs such as Qinhuangdao bought 40 packages, Hankou bought 20 packages, Sichuan bought 35 packages, Tianjin bought 10 packages, and the inland bought 10 packages. The cotton market is stable. The demand for raw cotton is mediocre, with no obvious development. Observing its phenomenon, it feels even quieter. However, the general intention of those holding goods is that few are willing to retreat and compromise. Throughout the day, only Chongxin Tongyi Factory bought 700 packages of Taicang cotton, with spot goods sent to the factory, and the price was 35 taels and 2 qian.</p>
<h3>The Rising Tide of Third-Grade Yarn Flowers</h3>

British cotton futures prices rose and fell by 1 to 3 points, with spot prices down 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. The Indian cotton market was quiet and stable, with near and far-term prices for Pingguo'er and Bailuo Creek both down 2 rupees, and near and far-term prices for Aomula down 1 rupee.

<h3>American Cotton Bulls Control the May Contract</h3>
<p>New York, March 28th telegraphic report on the cotton market situation for the week: The focus of the cotton exchange this week has been on the old cotton market, especially the May contract. Bulls have a very firm grip on this contract. When short covering began, there were limited sellers. It was rumored this week that some cotton in the South was being prepared for delivery, and some bulls were selling May and buying distant months, but the main bull players have shown little indication of liquidating. It is said that the main bulls are the cooperatives from various states. Local merchants are questioning whether the price difference in the May contract will cause the bulls to liquidate. In the near future, the cotton market will be focused on the May contract. Otherwise, the manipulation of market prices is likely to originate from the new cotton harvest. Attached below are the weekend statistics for American cotton (unit: thousands of bales):</p>

<h3>Grain: Rice Market Sales Dull, Prices Remain Stable</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, all rice from the 20th ward was delayed. The roads have now been cleared, but inventory in the city is very low. As the end of the month approaches, all shops are taking a wait-and-see approach and remain unchanged. Therefore, the entire day's sales were very dull. The price of northern japonica rice remains unchanged at 20 yuan. Rice from outside the customs is not moving, and buyers are hesitant to purchase because the authorities have strictly limited sales and are conducting investigations from time to time, so both sides are remaining quiet. However, it is concerning that once the shops' inventories are exhausted, they will inevitably have to make purchases, which may lead to special circumstances. Rice from Bo Liu has gone from firm to flat, with sluggish sales. Few people are buying Yang Du, Jian He, and Xia Liao. Furthermore, most of the out-of-town merchants have gone to the producing areas in the interior to buy, so no goods have arrived in this port for several days, and transactions have been very quiet. Only rice from Ke Bu is being traded slightly, and prices remain firm. The situation in Bai Yuan is mediocre and unremarkable.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Few boats have arrived with He Xia rice. Sales are still going well in this street. Transactions in Su-Chang machine-milled japonica rice have decreased. Some Zhong Guan rice is being purchased from villages, and prices are generally stable. Buying interest in Nan Bang Fei Lai Feng and other early indica rice from Bo is not bad because buyers from nearby cities are turning to this rice due to the scarcity of japonica. Transactions are lively. The overall market is the same as the previous day because it is difficult to see any loosening. Stocks of Yang Xian are dwindling. In the previous two markets, there was still Southern rice available, but yesterday it became even more scarce. The market for Du Xian is tightening. After the increase in the price of foreign rice, buyers still consider local indica rice as the standard, so there is a tendency for prices to rise. Bian Yuan's sales to distilleries are brisk, and arrivals are not strong. Top-quality rice is priced at 18 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Futures and Spot Prices Both Turn Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, with the new arrival of two ships of foreign rice, people's minds have settled down. One local merchant has shipments arriving on fixed routes, so spot sales are weak. The overall market spot price for No. 1 Saigon is only 15.6 yuan for 200 bags, 14.85 yuan for 600 bags of Xiao Jiao, and 15.25 yuan for 500 bags of Min Dang, all slightly lower than the previous market. With spot sales weak and few shipments moving, futures prices have followed and people's minds are trending downward. Prices fell slightly in the morning and stabilized slightly in the afternoon, but trading was not active. The overall market traded only 1,300 tons, it is said.</p>
<h3>Near-Term Flour Prices Plunge Before Settlement</h3>
<p>Short-Selling Factories Have Already Delivered 50,000 Bags of Warehouse Warrants</p>
<p>Profit-Taking by Bulls Leads to Sudden Market Downturn</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the futures market opened in the morning, prices for all months were still stable. The opening price for the current month was 2.5775 taels, and the prices for distant months were also stable. However, there was no actual demand from merchants, and this kind of unjustified price increase was not legitimate. When the market opened in the afternoon, the March and April contracts were suddenly hit hard because short-selling factories had already delivered 50,000 bags of warehouse warrants (said to be Samsung brand). Therefore, the bulls in the current month had no choice but to take profits and liquidate. Because actual sales were not active, outsiders could not purchase these warehouse warrants. Therefore, the market suddenly became much weaker. Near the close, prices had fallen back to 2.55 taels, down 0.0275 taels from the opening price in the morning. The April contract was also greatly impacted, and the distant months were slightly better. This kind of bull market without any real strength can be said to be purely speculative. As a result, the current month fell 0.0175 taels compared to the previous day, April fell 0.01 taels, May fell 0.005 taels, June and July each fell 0.0025 taels, and August fell 0.005 taels, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wheat Follows Flour Market into Retreat</h3>
<p>Over 5,000 Bags Traded</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the wheat futures market opened in the morning, the prices for all months were still strong, such as April and June, which were as much as 0.01 to 0.02 taels higher. However, as the flour market turned flat, wheat also became more moderate. When the market opened in the afternoon, due to the large-scale selling of flour, merchants were not buying, and people's minds were becoming uncertain. Therefore, the opening prices showed a downward trend. As a result, the April contract fell by 0.02 taels, June and July each fell by 0.01 taels, and August fell by 0.02 taels. Mill demand for spot wheat is still good because the small and medium-sized mills are selling a large amount of flour, so the demand for spot wheat has also increased sharply. Qingjiangpu wheat opened at 5.13 taels, Nansuzhou Bengbu wheat and Xuzhou wheat opened at 5.13 taels, 5.12 taels, Mingguang wheat opened at 5.1 taels, 5.08 taels, and Hankou wheat opened at 4.78 taels, 4.5 taels, for a total of 5,350 bags, it is said.</p>
<h3>Dried Vermicelli and Orchid Seeds in North-South Goods Market Rise and Fall Unevenly</h3>
<p>(Longkou Vermicelli) Arrivals are still scarce recently, but because sales are much worse than before, prices have declined again. Prices have already fallen by 1-2 taels. After customers bid 21 taels, there were no further bids. Current sales are only at 21 taels, and there are few buyers. Very little is being purchased from the interior of the street, and the trend is very flat and weak. (Orchid Seeds) Only about 20 more pieces of this batch have arrived. Although land prices have fallen since the previous market price drop, it is still difficult to make a profit, so customers are unwilling to sell cheaply, and the market has become firmer. Of the goods that arrived yesterday, half were transferred to Tianjin, and the remaining goods opened at 22.4 taels, up 0.07-0.08 taels from the previous market, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Scarce Dry Cocoons Lead to Brisk Mill Demand</h3>
<p>The inventory of dry cocoons in this port is scarce. It has long been impossible to reel silk until the new cocoons come on the market. An investigation of the dry cocoon inventory of various foreign firms in Shanghai shows that the total is less than 28,000 packages (Jiangsu and Continental firms have the largest inventory). European, American, and Shanghai white mill demand continues, and supply cannot meet demand, so the market is increasingly brisk. Yesterday, Qian Li and others delivered 80 packages of Shanghai white mill silk, and Zhong He and others delivered 15 packages of white dry silk, and prices were firm, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sugar and White Sugar Turn Flat After Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market telegraph from the producing area: The current price of Cuban sugar is still 2.00, the New York futures price for May is 1.79, and the December price is 1.95, each up 0.01, except for September, which is unchanged. Spot and futures prices for Javanese sugar are unchanged. The guild-regulated coarse and white sugar markets are still active, and the transaction price is from 7.275 to 7.3 taels. Later, with the increase in demand for delivery, the market suddenly turned flat and weak, up 0.05 taels from the previous day. No. 22 medium sugar was quoted at 7.2 taels but no transactions. Japanese sugar N Mark was 7.8 taels and SH Mark was 7.675 taels.</p>
<p>YP Mark was 7.8 taels, T Mark was 7.65 taels, transactions were scattered. A few hundred packages of domestic Mianhu red sugar continued to be quoted at 7.6 taels.</p>
