<p>昨日（一日）國民政府舉行總理紀念週王寵惠演講國民會議茲記演詞如次</p>
<p>本週紀念週輪到兄弟演講題目便是國民會議第一我們要知道此次四中全會認爲開國民會議是我們目前的一個重大而急切的問題</p>
<p>第二總理遺囑上已經很詳細的指示給我們對於我們國家前途的發展遺囑上也有通盤的計劃尤其對於開國民會議及廢除不平等條約並規定說（尤須於最短期間促其實現）其他的計劃總理固然也有規定但是只有這兩個問題便要限定最短期間促其實現所以我們對於總理遺囑上所說的這個問題及其步驟一定要使他在最短期間實現的</p>
<p>自國民政府建都南京以來關於　除不平等條約已經照總理遺囑努力進行務須在最短期間達到目的這是關於對外方面的對内方面的</p>

<h3 id="c72">接要聞 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>問題就是召開國民會議對於這個問題本黨是非常注意的但是以前因爲社會上不注意和各地軍閥的搗亂各省都没有平定所以這件重大的工作無從着手我們祇有討伐叛逆平定内亂之後才能實行這個問題總理主張的國民會議中外人士都有些不明暸以爲國民會議就是國民大會其實這兩個會議大不會相同總理所以主張開國民會議是有兩個目的第一·是求中國的統一第二·是求中國的建設所以我們</p>
<p>當今的急務便是要實現總理的計劃從速召開</p>
<p>國民會議現在内亂幸賴武裝同志和各位的努力奮鬥在此最短的期限内已經大致平定現在我們要努力的就是召開國民會議剛才已經講過國民會議的目的是求中國之統一和建設現在中國已經統一　所以此次四中全會宣言上很明白的說將建國的根本問題陳述於國民會議希望夠齊一全國的心志集中全國的力量來建設中國我們不可以爲國民會議同國民大會是一樣的總理在建國大綱上規定國民大會有兩種意義一種是公布想法第二是憲法公布以後行使中央统治權國民會議便不同國民會議是爲解决目前建設中國的重大問題國民大會乃是行使辦法職權開會的時期在訓政完成之後並不是在訓政時期依照建國大綱規定有過半數的省份完成地方自治之後才召開國民大會决定憲法行使中央統治權我們現在的國民會議意義完全不同如果各位要求明暸起見可以再研究總理在民國十三年有一個宣言并在北上的時候在上海和新聞記者的談話便可得一個梗槪不過有一件事各位須注意的當時總理主張開國民會議那時的背影</p>
<p>與現在完全不同當時各地方還在軍閥盤踞之下國内還没有統一離開建設的時期還很遠而且當時的政府是在北京與現在的情形大不同所以總理當時和新聞記者所談的話乃是商量中國以後的問題那時的背影和今日全國統一的現象完全不同現在訓政時期已經開始我們要如何召集開國民會議如何的組織如何的行使不能將那時的背影所談的話來逐字解說一定要拿眞的精神來研究形成一個新局面我們有這種眞精神來努力國民會議才有成功的希望</p>
<p>我們要曉得當時總理的主張背景雖然不同而總理的精神始終是一樣我們今天的情形雖然與從前不同而我們的精神也是在求統一中國而召開國民會議現在中國已經趨於統一的局面但是社會上還有些無形的反動份子都可以看得見的他們雖然没有槍砲機械一類的　　他們將些其他的器械例如反動的言論來極力擾亂社會一方面利用青年爲他的軍隊一方面引起國民的誤會來反對我們這種反種份子雖然是無形的但是爲害很大我們只有兩個辦法對付他們第一我們要曉得反動份子是因爲對於本黨主義完全不明暸因此而起誤會我們只有將本黨的主義與政綱極力的宣傳使他們明暸還有一法我們要知道他們不滿意我們的是不滿意我們所做的事情關於這一點我們只有拿出良心來憑心去做事我們以良心爲出發點而去努力以求達到總理天下爲公的精神</p>
<p>說到國民會議將來如何的組織如何的計劃須經很詳細的研究方能决定我們希望到了開會的時候有很圓滿的結果會期是規定在明年五月舉行希望各位努力做去我們要明白國民會議乃是促進將來懲政的基礎事實上是非常重要的這一點各位也是要注意的在訓政時期是以黨治國但是並不是專政不是喜歡要怎樣就怎樣這個以黨治國的職權是有意義的乃是總理把這個重大的責任付托給我們像英國美法國律之信託制度一樣乃是一種義務性質譬如說我有一件很重大的事自已因爲某種原故不能去做便可托付給自已相信的朋友去代做又如有人將身後的遺囑托付給律師執行所以這乃是由於委托者的信用而委托的不是權利我們的責任很大我們這個大責任就是由本黨的信托來代表國民行使職權這便謂之以黨治國我們都希望我們大家能夠努力做去將來憲政開始的時候交卸這個大責任時才不致受良心的責備</p>
<p>總理遺囑上所指示給我們的廢除不平等條約我們已經逐步進行已將達到成功的目的而國民會議明年五月也要開幕了回想自總理托付我們的那日起到現在已是五年了費了五年光陰的努力奮鬥才得有今日以後的工作總理雖然没有規定最短期間但是我們也要加倍努力的做去以求完成總理天下爲公的大使命這是兄弟所希望於各位的</p>

<p>今日開始運申河南烟葉爲出產大宗貨之一在馮軍北退以後本埠烟商始携欵人豫採運該貨來申備轉銷南洋各地乃第一批出省烟葉價値百餘萬元在裝運時即被扣留滬商輾轉呼籲昨始得到放行之訊茲將此事經過查記如下</p>
<p>扣留眞相　查滬上烟業往河南許昌定購之大批烟葉總數達三萬件價値一百數十萬元在上月中旬因豫中軍事終結此貨即令起運從平漢路轉漢口長江船來上海詎此項巨額烟葉從許昌裝出照例報納捐稅及貨到漢口有兩湖烟稅局局員徐少松報告漢關謂其由許運出所納之稅由馮玉祥所派之稅員收去國軍方面碍難承認立將此貨扣留不許轉運三萬件烟葉均遭扣押</p>
<p>烟商呼籲滬上烟業方面得報以貨額甚巨一旦被阻損失至大立報請烟業公會電致漢開及武漢當局聲明商人依章納稅並無不合不能因政治關係波及商民而且血本攸關殊難久阻一面派員赴漢向省府請放一面又請上海虞治卿等代電鄂主席何雪竹飭警備司令部將該項巨額烟葉尅日放運電函紛馳經半個月之久直至昨日始有結果</p>
<p>鄂省允放　湖北省府主席何成濬昨日復電來滬謂已彚集各方文電依滬上烟業公會及虞洽老之陳請飭屬復查於報稅手續尙屬相符已將此案往來文件轉發武漢警備司令部請其將該項扣留大宗豫省烟葉尅日准予放運至滬矣</p>

<p>一中一西　四時開會由交通大學校長黎照寰主席辯論員則分佔主席台之兩旁每校代表各三人光華代表悉衣中式長袍交大則均黑色西服一中一西相映成趣亦雋事也</p>
<p>詞鋒逼人　六代表依次輪流申述理由是日辯論題目爲（上海各大學應合併爲一大規模之大學（交大主正面光華主反面雙方理由均極充分正面理由大意爲時代需要經費節省反面理由則以各校有各校之特殊關係且性質不一何能混而爲一　戰脣槍咄咄逼人聽者咸感無上之興趣樂而忘倦焉</p>
<p>複辯之精彩　六代表輪流演說畢休息五分鐘即開始複辯複辯者即蒐集對方之理由而逐項加以駁斥也事出倉猝且爲時不過五分鐘故極爲不易交大劉旋天本其天才按光華各點而駁之直使對方體無完膚精彩百出歡聲雷動如光華謂大學應不限於國立及已立案者私立學校亦應包括在内而交大則謂未立案者已失其法定資格故不能認爲大學等等詞鋒往返煞是可聽</p>
<p>主席鼓勵女生加入　複辯旣畢由評判員朱少屏·桂中樞·陳鶴琴等計算分數主席乘間報告辯論之歷史及其利益並謂英語演說時有女生加入國語辯論則無之殊爲遺憾希望明年不致如此俾聽者更覺有味云</p>
<p>圖表可驚　交大方面爲充分增加實力起見特繪製圖表多種如各大學學生比較圖經濟狀况比賽圖等都十餘幅彩色鮮明繪製極工洵爲此次制勝之法寳可謂費盡心機矣</p>
<p>交大之雙喜　未幾主席宣布結果個人第一爲交大劉旋天得銀牌一塊團體第一屬正面遂亦爲交大所得可謂雙喜臨門一時歡呼之聲震動屋宇洵盛事哉</p>

<p>汽車事業之發展較任何交通工具爲迅速一日千里風行全球數十年間已成爲交通之重要問題不過所用汽油（俗名　士林Gasoline）所費甚貴近十年來柴油引擎進步甚快世界各大發電廠已漸改用柴油機最新火車亦已採用柴油引擎然用之於汽車者尙少據最近英國汽車界之報告柴油汽車已見成功費油省而耐用久開汽車工程之新紀錄各報宣揚贊許舉國稱慶我國年來各省公路疊興每年所耗油料爲數匪細倘能改用柴油機車可省至六分之一之鉅茲特將各車情形譯供參考</p>
<p>（一）華特門五座車Wardman　Five-Seater　car此車爲十匹馬力之柴油引擎裝入尋常之五座車身引擎軸速率爲每分鐘自二百至一千二百轉車之最高速率爲每小時二十英里月前在倫敦與勃拉登間London　and　Brighton試騐一往一來共一百十二英里費油不到二加侖（英國每加侖售五辦士每辦士合國幣七分）計費九辦士可謂廉極從前所謂重量Heavy　Weight及高壓High　Compression之困難業已制勝且燃燒完善其泄氣較汽油爲潔另有裝置開車甚易無打火器Mogneto引電圈Induction　Coil打火嘴Plug及混合器Carburator之裝置按打火器及混合器爲汽車上最易損壞之物故柴油機汽車之機件簡單管理亦易</p>
<p>（二）楷盾納式柴油公共汽車Gardner　type此車爲克勞斯來廠所造Crossley　Motor　Company　Manchester用楷氏柴油機裝在樓式之公共汽車馬力爲八十匹曾經行三萬英里毫無損傷試騐結果非常完美所需油價祇及尋常汽油之六　分之一蓋所費柴油祗三分之一而效力倍之其經濟效率Economical　Effecien達百分之八十以上每百哩祇需油費二先令七辦士如用汽油則需十六先令六辦士此車可容客四十八人每小時行四十英里</p>
<p>（三）來福利運貨車Laffley　lorry該車亦用柴油引擎載碎石四噸自孟却斯脫至倫敦行經一百九十二英里費入小時四十八分耗油九又百分之七十五加侖每加侖價五辦士半共費油價四先令六辦士其平均速度爲每小時二十一又十分之八英里此爲載重車之成功總觀上述柴油汽車已將成爲交通界之重要問題蓋柴油之燃燒點甚高不若汽油之易引火儲油之所亦較安全燃燒後泄氣不若汽油之臭味又少毒氣之含藏開車甚易馬力充足凡此已足駕乎尋常汽車而上之至其工程上之優點限於篇幅不及備贅容後再作討論耳</p>

<h3 id="c193">帝國主義殖民政策槪要 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 湯彬</p>
<p>胡石明著</p>
<p>殖民政策不獨爲政治上極形重要的一部份亦即現今世界最重大在的一個問題而處於半殖民地的中國民衆對於這問題更須有詳細研究的必要然而我們要曉得在近代殖民政策的後面却是一幅人類恐怖的寫眞並不是一幅文明移動的圖畫又可以說是一幅血肉狼藉充滿了殘暴悲慘號泣·死亡·使人戰慄悲憤的畫圖這是很顯明的事實我們祇要看一看印度安南朝鮮諸民族的實生活的情形便能知道殖民政策是一個如何的形態槪括的說殖民地的民衆簡直比奴隸牛馬魚肉還不如一切生殺予奪但聽憑帝國主義的旨意恣意施行殖民政策一天急進一天弱小民族的運命也就一天悲慘一天的了即是在我們半殖民地的中國像這些所謂悲慘的事實是隨時隨地可以看到的確（殖民政策不獨不足以促進文明的普及而反處處阻礙文化摧殘人道的東西了）</p>
<p>關於研究民殖政策的書籍尤其是有正確見地至以民族意識爲中心的在我們中國的出版界却很是少見胡君所著此書的目的是要使國人了解帝國主義殖民政策眞相及其實際的情形所以將對於帝國主義實施殖民政策之原因與其内幕加以詳細的分析和探討這不獨是給予研究政治及國際問題者有所助益亦可以使次殖民地國家的民衆得到應該具備的常識此書計分八章（一）緒論（二）殖民地的分類（三）近代殖民政策的由來（四）帝國主義侵占殖民地目的（五）殖民地統治的組織與形式（六）帝國主義統治殖民地的政策（七）近代各帝國主義殖民略史（八）結論最末並附錄（最近各帝國主義國家殖民地的調查）表尤有詳盡可貴</p>
<p>在緒論裏作者將帝國主義存在的要素與及對外侵略之今昔均加以客觀的解說是從古代有系統地說到近代如古代東方的亞述和巴比倫對外的侵略在十五世紀的開始西班牙葡萄牙殖民經營的實際情形與及近代繼西班牙而爲世界最大的殖民國家者英吉利均有詳細的述及至少在殖民的歷史上給予我們整個的系統的槪念</p>
<p>殖民地的分類作者是根據科學的方法得各國對於殖民地所採取的政策怎樣地不同並且指出它所具的特點即如英國對於殖民地依政治之組織分爲皇領殖民地和自治殖民地以直接隸屬於英皇下之總督統治該殖民地者名爲皇領殖民地這是像香港和海峽殖民地是屬於這一種各殖民地另有憲法有一個名義上的自治制有依選舉而產生的議會和長官者名爲自治殖民地這是像坎拿大南非諸聯邦是屬於這一種但是作者要使讀者能夠看出殖民地和殖民政策的特質便從重要的地方着眼所以除此種說法之外是以政治狀况上來分類（甲）單獨殖民地（乙）保護國（丙）租借地（丁）勢力範圍在每類之下均有詳盡的解說並以殖民地的所屬國爲根據其次是以經濟狀態上的來分類（甲）移殖殖民地（乙）對業殖民地（丙）商業殖民地（丁）種植殖民地）戍）軍事殖民地作者這樣的分類是具有深沈的意義而且是合理的</p>
<p>近代殖民政策的動力是將近代帝國主義厲行殖民政策的主因與副因如人口的增加交通的發達軍備的擴張基督敎的傳佈探險家的活動等加以探討像最後一種俄人之在亞比西尼亞英國之在西藏都藉科學考察的名義作偵探的工作這都是極形顯明的事實</p>
<p>帝國主義侵佔殖民地的目的是將它底目的何在爲什麽要侵略殖民地在它底本身有何利益對於這等重大的問題作者都有詳細的分析</p>
<p>殖民地統治之組織與形式（一）統治殖民地的主義因各國情形及必要的不同所以據作者的研究的計分爲四種（甲）同化主義（乙）自治主義（丙）集中主義（丁）分配主義（二）殖民地統治的組織計大别爲三種機關（甲）在母國統治機關（乙）在殖民地的統治機關（丙）殖民公司（三）殖民地統治的形式因爲各國的情形之不同所以各種形式也有多少差異但也可以大别爲四種（甲）保護統治殖民地（乙）特許統治殖民地（丙）直接統治殖民地（丁）自治統治殖民地作者對於每一種組織與形式都有獨到的見解這是很値得我們底注意</p>
<p>帝國主義統治殖民地的政策作者是將複雜的内容詳細論列（一）政治上的政策（二）財政上的政策（三）產業上的政策（四）交通上的政策（五）對於士人的政策這些都有所發揮令人讀之便能明白其實際的情形如何是很重要的一章</p>
<p>近代各帝國主義殖民略史是從歐洲各國從事殖民事業最早者次序述之如西葡殖民史荷蘭殖民史英國殖民史在澳洲方面則如新西蘭之殖民西澳等其次法國之經營北美意大利日本美國等殖民史均有詳述</p>
<p>總之作者本書是依據現代的眼光對於帝國主義殖民政策的分析換言之就是促醒各國的弱小民族有所覺醒當然在殖民地的民衆自身的痛苦是早有感覺到的全書雖然僅有八章但是將殖民政策的由來目的内容及各帝國主義實行殖民政策的略史其重要之處皆備述無遺末後詳列各帝國主義殖民地之調查足以供研究者的參考孫總理在三民主義裏已經說過我們中國已成爲次殖民地那麽我們對於這帝國主義的殖民政策更有研究的必要胡君此書在國中此項書籍出版尙少的時候是値得推薦於讀者之前的</p>
<p>[P寳山民衆</p>
<p>— 王鐵華</p>
<p>寳山民衆敎育館編輯</p>
<p>所謂民族當然是指全部份的份子而言决不是單指民族的智識份子的所以在某一個民族裏產生的文藝也不單是指智識份子從個人意識裏產生的那些作品乃是指從民族的立塲所形成的生活意識裏產生的而估定牠的價値這種民間的藴藏是不可忽略的</p>
<p>在過去本報上已經介紹過不少的書報關於民間故事民間傳說民間歌謠等像這類民族文藝之實的確値得加以注意推荐公之大衆因此我敢提出（實山民衆）來介紹一番</p>
<p>（實山民衆）是寳山縣民衆敎育館編輯的一張半月刋到現在差不多有兩年的歷史一晌不懈地努力着内容不消說是很豐富的好在能夠以淺顯的文筆寫誠懇的意思而灌輸到一般民衆去每期有短論雜談新聞歌曲創作等等調劑着一點也不覺得枯燥乏味最値得我們注意的是不少的民間歌謠在這裏發現同時這種短歌的創作和改造也有不少佳作獻給了（民衆）們這裏抄錄幾節</p>
<p>（小小鷄遍身黄那個女兒不想娘想起娘來無處去關起門來哭一塲雖說公婆待我好那及自已老子娘）</p>
<p>（吃不窮着不窮算計不通一世窮勸你看看南村方太公他的算計最精神公公自家挑擔賣黄怱婆婆也會削竹做燈籠大兒子推拿做郎中小兒子在南村街上學裁縫女兒新婦妨紗織布做女工你道他的算計通不通勸大家看看南村方太公）</p>
<p>二十八期</p>
<p>前一首大槪是指着新嫁娘後一首活現着一個鄉村間樸素生活</p>
<p>其他歌謠太多了實在不能多引只有摘錄幾首於下</p>
<p>大路邉上修學堂</p>
<p>過了幾個黄花女</p>
<p>氣死幾個讀書郎</p>
<p>媽也媽娘也娘</p>
<p>有女莫嫁讀書郎</p>
<p>許想夫妻重相會</p>
<p>除非回來換衣裳</p>
<p>要想夫妻重相會</p>
<p>除非天火燒學堂</p>
<p>有女嫁與莊稼漢</p>
<p>早同板橙夜同床</p>
<p>三十期</p>
<p>鄉下小姑娘</p>
<p>要學上海樣</p>
<p>學煞學死學不像</p>
<p>等到學來七分像</p>
<p>上海已經換花樣</p>
<p>南風吹來北風凉</p>
<p>家花那有野花香</p>
<p>家花說說尋相駡</p>
<p>野花說說細商量</p>
<p>三十五期</p>
<p>像這類民間歌謠的墾掘在（寳山民衆）上顯著了很大的功績同時又有不少的歌的劇作作者朱允宗君於此很下了一番努力把引史蹟來做四季上歌用一般民衆能夠瞭解的筆調來叙述一件事故假着普遍的山歌來漢輪（雪恥）的意識這類功作比着哼幾句（明月清風）歌幾句（妹妹我愛你）自然偉大得多了</p>
<p>在每一首（四季山歌）都寫着些（引子）在前面好敎看的人明白些事實現在我節引幾句在下面</p>
<p>（春季桃花顏色鮮英國人販進鴉片烟許多百姓吸上癮敗家弱種害無邊</p>
<p>夏季荷花滿池香林則徐一片好心腸盡力禁止販鴉片二萬箱（老土）才燒光）</p>
<p>鴉片之戰</p>
<p>此外也有把（省）（縣）等做題目也能給民衆以地理的歷史的常識就錄（實山縣）的一首</p>
<p>春季梅花香氣清寳山縣在江蘇省北界太倉南上海東邊是海西嘉定夏季荷花滿池香寳山田地已清丈畝數三十七多萬平平一片好地方秋季桂花像黄金寳山全縣五區分每區裏面有區長代替百姓辦事情冬季雪花白如棉寳山人口十六萬大家努力求上進將來做個模範縣關於歌謠的節引已經很多恐怕地位上將發生恐慌於是不得不轉筆到他方面去</p>
<p>我們知道民衆的集會與娛樂一方面夾雜許多封建和迷信的思想一方面也含有極强烈的民族精神對於這種集團行動如迎神賽會競渡唱花鼓戲不正當的娛樂等等在）寳山）方面自然不能絶對不發生并且察其舉動未始没有熱烈感情的表示集團意識的表現有組織的行動有動的活的情態這幾點也未使不符合於民族精神的那末當然不能加以消極的取締和禁止亟當整理和糾正他們的意識而加以發揮使無意識的變爲意識的的確是目下各地方上一件重要的事件關於這點該刋上也有很多論及</p>
<p>總之（寳山民衆）以民衆的立塲爲民衆講話對民衆講話在此（民衆敎育）亟待普及的時候該刋是負有重大責任的値得推荐和注意同時希望於民間文學多多搜集有爲民族求生存求自由求繁榮底目的的這種作品應該認爲是民族文藝之寳實不能忽視的</p>

<p>— 證天</p>
<p>從長沙動身來上海的時候竹均放了兩塊錢放我將口袋裏並且對我說</p>
<p>這學期我要開始魚油畫了此地買不到畫筆所以只好請你費力筆要買六支倘若錢不夠的話就請你爲我墊一點以後還你我在等着用呢要快些呀）</p>
<p>（好的　到上海就爲你買）</p>
<p>上海到了一天兩天三天一週兩週三週筆依然在筆店裏朋友並不是我忘記呀兩塊錢買六支油畫筆當然不夠何况我連兩塊錢都用掉了呢我是天天在爲着對不住你而焦急可是又有什麽辦法呢我就是用人格担保筆店裏也是不肯賒筆的</p>
<p>航空快信又是到了兩天了當我還没有拆開我就知道是來催筆的要是我今天不弄到幾塊錢你的電報又會要到了是不是你急於想過油畫癮的朋友喲</p>
<p>油畫筆大槪怕是金城工藝社要便宜一點我想於是就不遠從天通庵去法蘭西了</p>
<p>買好了筆已是下午五點半了雖然要趕回去吃晚飯可是我們是從新新里步行到霞飛路因爲坐黄包車要比法租界到虹口的電車錢加個倍的</p>
<p>時間已經是電燈的世界了霞飛路是洋勢力項表揚的區域兩旁的店子除了洋食物店洋裝店洋百貨店之外簡直没有幾個是中國人開的店子的旁邊密排着一列列的洋梧桐樹中間就是流水一樣的車馬和着震耳鼓的閙聲在那十字路口站着一匹雄壯的高大的馬馬上坐着一個人望着奔馳的人民一動也不動彷彿街上的一個青蠅都逃不過他的眼睛的一樣一個安南人立在底下恰和他的馬身一樣高在那仰承着馬上人的指揮</p>
<p>忽然馬上人手指一揚馬下的人立即跑到中間將一個年老的中國車夫的車子拉住接着走到背後將車上的照會取下仍跑轉去雙手將照會呈給馬上的人他接了只點了一下頭</p>
<p>那個年老的車夫那個可憐的車夫大槪是在那說緣電光之下老眼發量有了遠反了規則多走了一步或多退了一步的原故</p>
<p>衰老的車夫只是不然地將車子放到路的一傍一雙可憐的眼光望着他的坐客他是在嘆他自已的命運太惡他是想不出什麽辦法來</p>
<p>忽然地那枯老面上縐起一層苦笑他是在要求他的坐客替他去轉求巡捕抱着一個大的包袱的坐客也是和他一樣的老人很同情地及他走到巡捕的面前可是巡捕給他的回答只是棍子對他一搖他於是悄然的退回來</p>
<p>年老的乘客只是呆呆地望着他的包袱</p>
<p>年老的車夫只是呆呆地望着他那没有辦法的車子</p>
<p>他們兩個已忘了旁邊的熱閙</p>

<h3 id="e1">Explicit Order for Rectification of Principles and Disciplines <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, the National Government issued an order on the 2nd stating that in the past, the nation suffered numerous misfortunes and changes, and although the administrative facilities had a certain scale, they lacked practical effectiveness. Various agencies in the capital and elsewhere emerged in great numbers during this period, and the political orders were not unified, and the division of powers and responsibilities was even more lacking. Consequently, many of the matters under their jurisdiction were neglected, and they often failed to meet the planned schedule. Subordinate officials either failed to diligently implement orders, or indulged in procrastination, wasting time, or adhered to old habits without any intention of making progress. Even during the period of political tutelage, they lacked the will to work hard. Senior officials, being role models, had the responsibility to supervise their subordinates, and their assessment of performance should have been strict and clear. However, they themselves often failed to comply with laws and regulations, arbitrarily leaving their posts, and they also lacked any oversight of the merits and demerits and work performance of their staff, allowing them to be negligent. The government placed the highest importance on integrity and strictly prohibited corruption, yet it feared that the evils of encroachment had not been completely eliminated. The sojourn of the party's guiding spirit [likely referring to Chiang Kai-shek] was inevitably accompanied by favoritism, yet no one was heard to expose a single person or matter to uphold the national law and warn corrupt officials. In this way, the foundation of the government was impure and the principles and disciplines were becoming increasingly lax. If swift rectification and vigorous reforms were not implemented, how could the effect of removing the old and establishing the new and establishing a long-lasting peace be achieved? Now that the overall situation has been pacified and the foundations of the country have been re-established, a strict warning is hereby issued. Hereafter, all political and military agencies across the country must respect principles and disciplines, strictly adhere to their powers and responsibilities, supervise their subordinates to earnestly take responsibility, and must not again engage in the evil habits of leakage, laziness, division, and discord. Service personnel who are still accustomed to comfort and abandon their responsibilities will be severely punished in accordance with the law, and the responsible senior officials will also be given disciplinary action for dereliction of duty. Those who violate the law for personal gain, encroach on public funds, or falsely claim benefits will be guilty of unforgivable crimes. Once discovered, they will be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Heaven's surveillance is awesome, and gentlemen cherish the law. All officials, be cautious and do not neglect this order.

<h3 id="e2">Central Political Council Reviews and Enriches Secretariat Proposal <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, the Central Political Council (CPC) resolved at the Fourth Plenary Session to enrich the CPC Secretariat. The manner in which to enrich the secretariat was to be reviewed by committees from various groups, who would then deliberate and decide on the matter before submitting it to a plenary session for resolution and implementation. A joint review meeting of various groups was convened at the Central Party Headquarters on the afternoon of the 2nd. More than ten people attended, including Wang Chonghui, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Wang Boqun, Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, Liu Jiwen, He Yingqin, Shao Yuanchong, Yu Jingtang, Zeng Yangfu, and Chen Lifu. Sun Ke chaired the meeting. The Secretariat first presented the proposal, and after careful deliberation by the committees, it was decided that the economic group would have three special secretaries, to be assumed by the political vice-ministers of the three ministries of railways, communications, and industry. The finance group would have one, to be assumed by the political vice-minister of the Ministry of Finance. The foreign affairs group would be assumed by the political vice-minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The military affairs group would have two, to be assumed by the political vice-ministers of the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Navy. The education group would have one, to be assumed by the political vice-minister of the Ministry of Education. The local autonomy group would have one, to be assumed by the political vice-minister of the Ministry of Interior. The political report group and the legal group were yet to be determined. It was generally expected that the political report group would be assumed by the secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, and the legal group would be staffed by someone from the Ministry of Judicial Administration or appointed by the CPC. The results of the review were scheduled to be presented to the plenary session on the morning of the 3rd. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e11">The US Congress' Economic Report <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Since the European War, everyone has known that the power of the world economy is in the hands of the United States. When discussing economic affluence, everyone refers to the United States. However, since the recent global commercial decline, the United States has also been affected, just like other countries. Not only has it been affected, but it has been affected even more than countries that were not economically affluent in the past. Looking at President Hoover's economic report to the US Congress, although he said he was not pessimistic, the impact is not small, judging by the figures in his report.</p>
<p>He said that the budget was originally expected to have a surplus of $123 million, but it is now short by $180 million. The difference is more than $300 million. He also said that a survey in April showed that there were approximately 2.5 million unemployed people nationwide. No clear figures have been released since April. He also said that he was asking Congress to allocate $100 to $150 trillion in emergency relief funds to accelerate all construction projects, so that more people would have jobs within six months. He also said that the estimated national expenditure for 1932 would reach $4,054,000,000, and the revenue, if the tax rate was not reduced, would reach $4,085,000,000.

<p>Communist Demonstration Outside the Meeting Place Clashes with Police</p>
<p>The Two Major Parties Cooperate Harmoniously, Hoover Reports on the Economic Situation</p>
<p>Washington, 1st (Reuters) As Congress convened today, 600 communists carrying banners with the words "Release Political Prisoners" gathered outside the Capitol. Police attempted to seize their banners, but the communists refused, so the police wielded batons and dispersed them, also throwing tear gas bombs. There was a fierce struggle for some time, and several female party members were severely trampled. Then, a large force of police arrived and finally dispersed the demonstrators, arresting six people.</p>
<p>Washington, 2nd (Reuters) The opening of Congress has shown that the Republican and Democratic parties can cooperate harmoniously. This goodwill can be maintained at least during the passage of plans to alleviate commercial depression and unemployment. A movement has begun to postpone consideration of the United States joining the World Court for twelve months to avoid hindering other congressional business. Even supporters of joining now express sympathy for this movement. The disturbances by communists outside the Capitol yesterday did not concern Congress. Republican Congressman Larkmann has introduced a bill in the House that, if passed, would completely prohibit Russian citizens from entering the country. There are several bills in this session of Congress dealing with the Red Party movement; this is one of them.</p>
<p>Washington, 1st (Reuters) Democratic leader Robinson has introduced a bill in the Senate to raise $60 million to purchase seeds and straw socks to aid farmers in drought-stricken areas.</p>
<p>Washington, 1st (Reuters) In his annual report to Congress, President Hoover addressed the domestic commercial depression, stating that the budget was originally expected to have a surplus of $122.3 million, but is now short $180 million. However, the fundamental safety of the national economic life has not been damaged. A survey in April showed that the total number of unemployed people nationwide was approximately 2.5 million, but according to the index of major industries published by the Ministry of Labor, there has been an increase since April. President Hoover requested Congress to approve the allocation of emergency relief funds of 100 to 150 trillion yuan to accelerate all construction projects, so as to increase employment in the next six months. However, he intended that there would be no need for relief after six months. The estimated national expenditure for 1932 is 4,054,000,000 yuan, and the income, if the tax rate is not reduced, will be 4,085,000,000 yuan. President Hoover is not pessimistic about the overall situation, saying that national peace and security have greatly improved in the past year, the fundamental safety of the national economic life has not been damaged, and there has been progress in education and scientific inventions. The main driving force of the commercial depression is outside the United States. The panic of the American people has delayed our recovery. President Hoover continued, saying that the United States has retained 80% to 85% of its usual activity and income. All major financial institutions in the country have been able to safely weather this storm. As for prices, they remain stable, and the demand for products in various industries has increased compared to before. The whole world is now reorganizing to seek stability. President Hoover mentioned national defense in only a few words, saying that the London Naval Treaty has put the United States on an equal footing with the strongest foreign country and has greatly reduced the United States naval expenditures. President Hoover finally mentioned the future of the country, requesting Congress to consider laws to facilitate the consolidation of railways and to amend immigration laws to increase the severity of deportation laws so that foreign criminals cannot remain in the United States.</p>

<p>London, 1st (Reuters) A committee of the Indian Round Table Conference met today and endorsed the principle of separating Burma from India. It also appointed a special committee to consider the conditions under which Burma could be separated from India on an equal footing and to recommend the best way to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>London, 1st (Reuters) Indian Hindu and Muslim representatives attending the Indian Round Table Conference have held several talks and have now broken down. Muslims and non-Muslims each have their own electoral districts. Now, Indian Hindus are demanding a joint electoral system, which Muslims do not agree with, as this system would give Hindus an advantage. It is reported that Muslim representative Agha Khan stated that the fourteen points agreed upon by the Muslim Congress in Lucknow last year regarding this issue are the absolute minimum that cannot be reduced, and that Muslims will not give up on them. Indian Hindus now say that there will be no further negotiations between Hindus and Muslims, but that various issues concerning the status of minorities will be handled by the Federal Relations Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e60">German Financial Reform Plan Compulsory Implementation by the Government <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Announced by Presidential Decree</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (National News Agency) The German financial reform plan, which has been unresolved for months, was signed into law tonight by President Hindenburg through an emergency decree. The full text will be published tomorrow. After the government refused to amend the proposals of the Social Democratic Party, it knew that it was certain that it would not obtain a majority in the Reichstag. Therefore, at this morning's cabinet meeting, it was decided to cut the Gordian knot by not submitting it to the Reichstag for discussion, but first asking the President to promulgate it by administrative order under Article 48 of the Constitution regarding emergency measures. At noon, Prime Minister Brulling met with the President to obtain his consent, and the order was signed out that evening. Of the 28 financial bills proposed by the cabinet, only 25 were signed and issued. The other three, which involved the financial relationship between the federal treasury and the states, were not signed. According to the German government, this is the first time that Article 48 of the Constitution has been invoked for a bill that has not been deliberated by the Reichstag, so this action is of considerable importance in constitutional history. The Reichstag will open within this week, and it is reported that the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party have decided to submit a motion demanding that the President rescind his order. At that time, the National People's Party and the Economic Party will also support this motion, but it is expected that the Social Democratic Party will put the overall situation first and assist the government to defeat the motion.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (National News Agency) The German papers uniformly acknowledge that the financial reform plan, announced by presidential decree on Monday evening, was an unavoidable measure. A Free Party paper states that Prime Minister Brüning should be thanked, as this action has maintained Germany's international credit. However, if party leaders are unable to follow the policies of the national leader wholeheartedly in the future, it is feared that even if Brüning is devoted, he will be unable to resist fate alone.</p>

<p>Continued Testimony of Defendant Remisin</p>
<p>British Government Denies Involvement in Conspiracy</p>
<p>Moscow, 1st (National News Agency) At today's continued hearing of the industrial sabotage case, special attention was given to the relationship between the Industrial Group and the Paris White Russian Chamber of Commerce. Defendant Remisin provided detailed information on how plans for foreign intervention and counter-revolutionary activities were formulated, as well as his contacts with the Chamber of Commerce in Paris in 1927. He said that at that time, the Chamber of Commerce wanted to postpone the implementation of the intervention plan, but the Soviet Union, considering the increasing strength of Soviet military preparations, advocated launching it as soon as possible. At this point, the presiding judge read out an article published by the Paris White Russian newspaper on July 7 of this year, which stated, in summary, that approximately 500,000 people would be sufficient to implement the main parts of the plan in three or four months, and that the police could be responsible for the remaining work of clearing out communist squads. The estimated cost of intervention was approximately 10 billion rubles, but subsequent income would be at least five times this amount. After gathering another 1 million people to form an international volunteer army, Europe could slightly alleviate the unemployment panic, and the industry of all countries could be revitalized after Russia was freed from communist shackles, etc. The presiding judge stated that this kind of statement was sufficient to represent the attitude of the members of the Chamber of Commerce. Then, Remisin continued to testify that he went to Paris twice last year and participated in a formal meeting of the Chamber of Commerce with Lai Liqifu, where he discussed the Russian situation with French political circles in order to prepare for intervention. However, the main issue discussed at that time was the relationship between the committee and the French government. The leaders of the committee had discussed how to prepare for intervention with Pounz责白里安 and the French General Staff Committee. At that time, the French General Staff had begun practical and concrete preparations for intervening in the Soviet Union. Subsequently, Lai Liqifu's testimony was similar to that of Lai Muxun, and he stated that the oil companies under Sir Henry in England had sent a written statement to the London Soviet Russian Petroleum Trust requesting that 5% of the oil sales in England be given to the former owners of the Russian oil mines, otherwise the British oil merchants would jointly boycott Soviet Russian oil in the domestic market. However, the Soviet Russian Petroleum Trust did not agree to this request because it feared that the money would be received by the White Russian Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>London, 1st (National News Agency) The British government has instructed its ambassador to Russia to send a letter to the Russian Foreign Ministry denying the claims in the confessions in the industrial sabotage case that the British government encouraged other countries to intervene militarily in the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Japan Plans to Implement Korean Autonomy <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Colonial Affairs Releases Concrete Plan</p>
<p>Korean Insiders Call It a Deceptive Policy</p>
<p>Seoul Special Dispatch The Japanese government, recognizing that the progress of the Korean independence movement cannot be stopped, intends to ease the high-pressure policy of force that it has adopted and implement autonomy, hoping to prevent Koreans from engaging in movements to secede from Japanese territory. Regarding the autonomy system, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs has recently released a concrete plan and intends to submit it to the cabinet for approval, after which it will be implemented. The content of the autonomy system is as follows: (A) Provincial System (1) The existing provincial councils will be changed to provincial assemblies. The provincial councils are merely advisory bodies, while the provincial assemblies will be decision-making bodies. (2) The provincial assembly will have a chairman and a vice-chairman. The chairman will be concurrently held by the provincial governor, while the vice-chairman will be elected by the members of the provincial assembly. (3) Two-thirds of the members of the provincial assembly will be elected by the members of the fu and yi assemblies, and the other one-third will be appointed by the provincial governor. (B) Fu System (1) The fu councils will be changed to fu assemblies, transforming them from advisory bodies to decision-making bodies. (2) The fu assembly will have a chairman and a vice-chairman. The chairman will be concurrently held by the fu yin, while the vice-chairman will be elected by the members. (C) Yi and Mian System (1) The existing mian system will be changed to the yi and mian system, with 41 mian becoming yi. (2) The yi will have an yi assembly as a decision-making body. (3) The election system will be implemented in each mian, and the mian councils will be advisory bodies. Looking at the above revisions of the yi, fu, mian, and yi systems, the yi and fu assemblies have always been merely advisory bodies, and the provincial governor of the yi and the fu yin of the fu, as the highest administrative officials of the local government, have always been Japanese. The provincial governor concurrently holds the position of chairman of the yi assembly, and the fu yin concurrently holds the position of chairman of the fu assembly. The so-called yi assembly and fu assembly are inevitably controlled by the administrative officials (Japanese). Various restrictions are also set on the election and eligibility to be elected of the members, so that Koreans account for a minority and Japanese account for an overwhelming majority. Koreans who have even the slightest anti-Japanese sentiment are considered ("bad Koreans") and their right to vote and be elected is revoked. As a result, the existing local assemblies are exclusively occupied by Japanese officials and pro-Japanese Korean officials. The revised autonomy plan released by the Ministry of Colonial Affairs still restricts Korean participation in the local assemblies. Therefore, after the plan was released, Koreans generally opposed it, calling it a deceptive policy by the Japanese. (World)</p>

<p>Members of the Minseito Party Begin Persuasion Campaign</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Telecommunications) The situation in the House of Peers regarding the next session of parliament is not optimistic. In particular, some members of the House of Peers have expressed strong opposition to the Labor Union Law Bill and the Tenant Law Bill. Regarding the Election Reform Bill, there are those who advocate that lowering the election age is premature. Even the Justice Society is taking a more neutral stance on the London Conference than on other issues, but is strongly opposed to this issue, so the atmosphere is quite tense. In addition, the Musha Incident and financial issues have also created a fairly negative atmosphere towards the government. Therefore, the government also knows that the difficulties facing the 59th session of parliament lie in the House of Peers. It will concentrate its efforts on the Upper House and frequently discuss countermeasures to ensure that there are no regrets. In particular, if Prime Minister Hamaguchi is unable to attend parliament, it will be easier for the opposition to take advantage. Therefore, if the decision on whether the Prime Minister will attend is made at the last minute, it will inevitably delay matters. Currently, Eki Tetsuo, Watanabe, head of the legislative bureau, Kawasaki, Kita, Kiyo, Mitsu, and other members of the Minseito party who are in charge of policy in the House of Peers are fully mobilized and are beginning to persuade those involved in various areas.</p>

<p>London, 1st (Reuters) The Scottish Conciliation Council adjourned this afternoon without a resolution. Fifty percent of the miners in a certain mining area have been incited by the Communist Party and did not work today. At a miners' meeting last night, Communist Party members scrambled onto the rostrum to speak out against accepting the proposals of the Miners' Federation. Today, the Communist Party is implementing picketing in the mining areas.</p>
<p>London, 1st (Reuters) The executive of the Scottish Coal Miners' Union has convened representatives of the miners to meet in Glasgow tomorrow to consider a report on the situation of the executive's meeting with the mine owners today and to make a public decision on the steps to be taken thereafter. At the same time, the union executive is advising miners not to give in.</p>
<p>London, 1st (Reuters) Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Mines, Ewing, stated in the House of Commons today that almost all mines in England and Wales are working today. Eighteen percent of Scottish miners are working. Left-wing Labour MP Mrs. Lee asked what actions the government would take to relieve the hunger in the Scottish coal areas. Ewing replied that the Scottish Conciliation Council should be able to reach a solution today.</p>

<p>London, 1st (Reuters) The population of England and Wales increased by 70,000 in the quarter ending at the end of September due to more births and fewer deaths, and the infant mortality rate was also extremely low.

<h3 id="e71">Wang Chonghui's Speech on the National Assembly <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 1st), the National Government held a weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, and Wang Chonghui delivered a speech on the National Assembly. The following is a record of his speech:</p>
<p>This week, it is my turn to speak at the memorial service, and the topic is the National Assembly. First, we must know that the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee considered convening a National Assembly to be a major and urgent issue for us at present.</p>
<p>Second, the late Premier's will has given us very detailed instructions regarding the future development of our country, and the will also contains a comprehensive plan, especially for convening a National Assembly and abolishing unequal treaties, and stipulates that "(it is especially necessary to urge their realization in the shortest possible time)." Although the late Premier also stipulated other plans, only these two issues were required to be realized in the shortest possible time. Therefore, we must ensure that this issue mentioned in the late Premier's will and its steps are realized in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has been working hard to abolish unequal treaties in accordance with the late Premier's will, and it must achieve its goal in the shortest possible time. This is regarding the external aspect; regarding the internal aspect,</p>

<h3 id="e72">Excerpts of Important News <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>the issue is convening the National Assembly. The Kuomintang has paid great attention to this issue, but in the past, because society did not pay attention and warlords in various places caused trouble, the provinces were not pacified, so this major task could not be started. We can only implement this issue after suppressing rebellions and quelling internal turmoil. Some people at home and abroad do not understand the National Assembly advocated by the late Premier, and they think that the National Assembly is the same as the National Congress. In fact, these two meetings are very different. The reason why the late Premier advocated convening the National Assembly was for two purposes: First, to seek the unification of China; Second, to seek the construction of China. Therefore, we</p>
<p>must realize the late Premier's plan as soon as possible and convene the National Assembly. Now, the internal turmoil has been largely quelled within the shortest period of time thanks to the efforts and struggles of our armed comrades and everyone else. Now, what we must strive for is to convene the National Assembly. As I have just said, the purpose of the National Assembly is to seek the unification and construction of China. Now that China has been unified, the declaration of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee clearly states that the fundamental issues of nation-building will be presented to the National Assembly, hoping to unify the will of the whole country and concentrate the strength of the whole country to build China. We must not think that the National Assembly is the same as the National Congress. The late Premier stipulated in the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction that the National Congress has two meanings: one is to announce ideas, and the other is to exercise central ruling power after the constitution is promulgated. The National Assembly is different from the National Congress. The National Assembly is to solve the major issues of building China at present. The National Congress is to exercise methods and powers. The time for the meeting is after the completion of the period of political tutelage, not during the period of political tutelage. According to the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, the National Congress will be convened after more than half of the provinces have completed local autonomy to decide on the constitution and exercise central ruling power. Our current National Assembly has a completely different meaning. If you want to understand clearly, you can further study the late Premier's declaration in 1924 and his conversation with reporters in Shanghai when he went north, and you can get a general idea. However, there is one thing that you must pay attention to. The background when the late Premier advocated convening the National Assembly at that time</p>
<p>was completely different from now. At that time, various places were still occupied by warlords, and the country was not yet unified, and it was still far from the period of construction. Moreover, the government at that time was in Beijing, which is very different from the current situation. Therefore, what the late Premier talked about with reporters at that time was discussing the future issues of China. The background at that time and the phenomenon of national unity today are completely different. Now that the period of political tutelage has begun, we must not interpret the words spoken in the background at that time literally when we discuss how to convene the National Assembly, how to organize it, and how to exercise it. We must study with the true spirit and form a new situation. Only if we have this true spirit to work hard can the National Assembly have the hope of success.</p>
<p>We must know that although the late Premier's proposition and background were different at that time, the late Premier's spirit was always the same. Although our situation today is different from the past, our spirit is also to seek to unify China and convene the National Assembly. Now China has tended to a unified situation, but there are still some invisible reactionary elements in society that can be seen. Although they do not have guns and cannons, they use some other instruments, such as reactionary remarks, to try their best to disturb society. On the one hand, they use young people as their army, and on the other hand, they cause misunderstandings among the people to oppose us. Although these reactionary elements are invisible, they are very harmful. We only have two ways to deal with them. First, we must know that the reactionary elements are misunderstanding because they do not fully understand the Kuomintang's doctrine. We only need to vigorously publicize the Kuomintang's doctrine and program to make them understand. There is another method. We must know that what they are dissatisfied with is what we have done. Regarding this point, we only need to act with conscience and do things with our hearts. We take conscience as the starting point and work hard to achieve the late Premier's spirit of "the world is for all."</p>
<p>Speaking of how the National Assembly will be organized and planned in the future, it needs to be decided after very detailed research. We hope that there will be a very satisfactory result when the meeting is convened. The meeting period is scheduled to be held in May next year. We hope that everyone will work hard to do it. We must understand that the National Assembly is the foundation for promoting future constitutional government and is in fact very important. This point is also something that everyone should pay attention to. During the period of political tutelage, the Kuomintang governs the country, but it is not dictatorship, and it is not like doing whatever one wants. This power of the Kuomintang to govern the country has meaning. It is the late Premier who entrusted this important responsibility to us, just like the trust system in British, American, and French laws. It is a kind of obligation. For example, if I have a very important matter that I cannot do myself for some reason, I can entrust it to a friend I trust to do it for me. Another example is that someone entrusts their will to a lawyer to execute it. Therefore, this is due to the trust of the entrusting party, not the right. Our responsibility is very great. Our great responsibility is to exercise power on behalf of the people through the trust of the Kuomintang. This is called the Kuomintang governing the country. We all hope that everyone can work hard to do it so that we will not be condemned by our conscience when we hand over this great responsibility when constitutional government begins in the future.</p>
<p>We have been gradually carrying out the abolition of unequal treaties instructed to us in the late Premier's will, and we are about to achieve success. And the National Assembly will also open in May next year. Recalling that it has been five years since the late Premier entrusted us with that task, it has taken five years of hard work and struggle to achieve today. Although the late Premier did not stipulate the shortest period for future work, we must also work harder to complete the late Premier's great mission of "the world is for all." This is what I hope for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Lifting of Martial Law Announced in Ganzhou <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>In the future, public security will still be the responsibility of the garrison headquarters. Nanchang Correspondence: The bandit communists Zhu De, Mao Zedong, and others advanced into Nanxun via Yongfeng, Xingan, and Zhangshu in July. Zhu's forces even advanced to Fengcheng, 120 miles away from the provincial capital. In order to consolidate the rear, Lu, the commander-in-chief of the Ninth Route Army, specially appointed Zhang Huizan, the commander of the 18th Division, as the temporary martial law commander of Nanchang and promulgated martial law regulations to implement martial law. Since then, all the entertainment venues in Nanchang City have been closed, and from 9:00 p.m. to dawn every day, no one is allowed to walk on the road without a password. The city scene suddenly became bleak and desolate. The bandit-occupied counties on both sides of the Gan River were gradually recovered, and the air in the provincial capital improved day by day. The financial situation in the market also gradually improved. Commander-in-Chief Lu specially telegraphed Xiao, the Chief of Staff of the Ninth Route Army, on November 29, ordering that martial law be lifted from today (the 1st). All the entertainment venues are therefore reorganizing and preparing to open. It is found that the tension in the province since the declaration of martial law on July 26, four months and six days ago,</p>
<p>has gradually disappeared. The garrison headquarters' announcement of lifting martial law is recorded below: (According to the telegram from Lu Yan, the commander-in-chief of the Ninth Route Army of the Punitive Expeditionary Force, all the bandits have been repeatedly defeated by our army and have now fled far away and will no longer endanger the provincial capital. It is ordered that martial law be declared lifted from December 1st. In the future, the public security of Nanchang City will still be the responsibility of the garrison organs. In addition to reporting and distributing, it is hoped that the citizens will be notified for information, etc. According to this, Nanchang City is an important place in the provincial capital. I am sincerely afraid that communist bandits and hooligans will mix among them and take the opportunity to think about their success. In order to strictly prevent the treacherous and wicked, a password pass is still required to pass through the streets after 12:00 p.m. In addition to reporting and ordering, the public notice will be issued so that everyone knows. This notice (the 1st).)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Hubei Provincial Government Announces the Huang Changgu Embezzlement Case <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The case of Huang Changgu, the former Director of the Construction Department of Hubei Province, who used excessive funds during his tenure, has now been thoroughly investigated by the Hubei Provincial Government. The results show that there is indeed embezzlement. In addition to submitting a request to the central government to dismiss and punish Huang, the entire case was also announced yesterday. The Provincial Government's announcement is recorded as follows: (It is found that Huang Changgu, a member of this government, handled a total of 1,875,079 yuan, 7 jiao, 4 fen, and 8 li of old and new receipts during his tenure as the Director of the Construction Department. In addition to borrowing and transferring 300,000 yuan to the Finance Department and paying 150,000 yuan to the central government, the remaining 1,425,079 yuan, 7 jiao, 4 fen, and 8 li was not only used up completely in just over half a year, but also required an additional 240,000 yuan for the completion of the fortress roads.</p>
<p>There were many abuses and no achievements. As a result, public opinion condemned him and the Kuomintang criticized him. At that time, Cheng Jun was on the front line</p>
<p>punishing the rebels and felt heartbroken when he heard about it. Later, it was reported that the former director of the department had withdrawn all the public funds deposited in the Hubei Provincial Bank when the military situation on the front line was tense, and it was not known what his intention was. Therefore, the committee of this government designated members Zhang Guanshi, Xiong Bingkun, Xie Lvfang, Da Zhi, and Secretary-General Hua Jueming to be responsible for investigating the accounts and projects handled by the former director in order to verify and handle them. The former director was afraid of guilt and repeatedly evaded. He first secretly went to the capital and claimed that he was going to Liuhe to meet with the Commander-in-Chief to report on the fortress road project, and telegraphed that all the documents had been submitted directly to the central government. He then submitted a request to be transferred to Beijing for review. After telegraphing a request to the National Government, he was still allowed to investigate locally by this government and has found conclusive evidence and obvious cases of corruption, exceeding 50,000 yuan; over-budget and improperly reported expenses, over 14,000 yuan; unauthorized use of funds, nearly 600,000 yuan; and the total number of pages and accounts of his handled account books were inconsistent with the number of pages and accounts of the sub-accounts, which is a clear proof of complete fabrication. Cheng Jun, as the supervisor, was responsible and dared not conceal it. He had already submitted the documents to the Chairman of the National Government for review when he went to Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee. After returning to the province, he telegraphed the Executive Yuan to order Huang Changgu to return to Hubei immediately to handle the handover of duties. Now, according to the verbal report of the members of the Fortress Road Acceptance Committee, the numbers of the Hanzhoung, Zuozhen, Cangyang Roads accounts did not match between the numbers issued by the department and the numbers received by the engineering office, and the numbers issued by the department did not match the numbers received by the contractors. The whole situation was chaotic and the abuses were obvious. The piers of the Fuhe Bridge he repaired were already tilted and would collapse in the spring flood. The foundation of the Houhu Road, which cost over 30,000 yuan, was hasty and erroneous, and the road was completed but could not be used. Once the water rose and washed away, it would turn into nothing. And the high unit price of the entire road was even more shocking. And according to the proposal of Member Xie Lu, in order to jointly investigate and verify that the evidence of Huang Changgu's, the former Director of the Construction Department, inflated reports and indiscriminate expenditures was conclusive, please announce the entire case immediately and submit a request to the National Government to first remove the member from his position and severely punish him in accordance with the law in order to clean up the officialdom. The 75th meeting of this government decided to announce the entire collection immediately and report it to the central government. In addition to investigating and deciding to submit a request to the Executive Yuan to promptly remove the former director from his current position as a member of this government, order him to return to Hubei immediately to liquidate and punish him severely in accordance with the law, and wait for the completion of the acceptance of the Fortress Road Provincial Highway before reporting and announcing separately, the attached report on the investigation of the Huang case and its evidentiary photos are hereby urgently attached for public notice. (The report on the investigation of the Huang case is omitted due to space limitations))</p>
<h3 id="e75">Liaoning Province Plans to Establish a Match Monopoly Bureau <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Zhang Zhenlu, the Director of the Department of Finance of Liaoning Province, previously stated that since matches are a daily necessity for society, the demand in various parts of Liaoning Province is very large. Although there are many domestic match factories in this province, only four companies, such as Guandong Sanming, Zhengsheng, and Huilin, have relatively large capital and wide sales channels. However, in recent years, due to the oppression of Swedish match merchants, all have suffered a setback. Small factories have mostly been bought by foreigners, resulting in the formation of a Swedish merchant monopoly on matches in Liaoning Province, and the outflow of profits is enormous. In order to resist foreign merchants and recover rights, it is proposed to establish a Match Monopoly Bureau. All matches from domestic factories in this province are not allowed to be sold by the factories themselves. All matches will be purchased and sold by the bureau to resist foreign goods. A request has been submitted to the Provincial Government to be forwarded to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee for review. Now, an order from the Political Affairs Committee has been received stating that this case has been approved by this meeting. The proposed establishment of a Match Monopoly Bureau by the Department should be approved for trial implementation, and the Department of Finance of Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces should follow suit. After receiving the order, the Department of Finance of Liaoning Province considered that the establishment of a Match Monopoly Bureau was urgent and specially decided on the following implementation measures: (1) Investigate the number and names of match factories in Liaoning Province; (2) the</p>
<p>total amount of capital of each factory and the location of establishment; (3) the annual</p>
<p>sales volume and where they sell best. Once these are ascertained, the establishment will be implemented immediately. A letter has been sent to the General Chamber of Commerce of each province yesterday to instruct the Match Industry Federation to comply with the investigation to facilitate preparations (the 29th).</p>

<p>Former Anhui Finance Commissioner Bao Geng was ordered by the Provincial Government to be arrested by the Wuhu Municipal Public Security Bureau because Bao's accounts were unclear. Not long after, Xu Riyong, the chief of the special office's examination and contract section, was also arrested. Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau sent personnel to escort Bao and Xu to the province because they received a telegram from the province.</p>
<p>Bandits were discovered in Guichi. County Magistrate Yuan of the county led soldiers and police to encircle and attack them. A fierce battle ensued, killing the bandit leader Chen Laojiu and more than ten bandits, capturing five alive, and seizing more than seventeen rifles. The remaining bandits fled towards Huangpeng. The Provincial Government reported that yesterday it had telegraphed the affiliated departments to notify them.</p>
<p>The Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce convened an extraordinary meeting at 3:00 p.m. today to discuss the year-end settlement issues. It was generally agreed that Wuhu's commerce was more connected with Shanghai, Zhenjiang, and Wuxi. It was resolved to take the same attitude as Shanghai and Wuxi and set the end date as before February 16, 20th year of the Republic. All merchants have been notified.</p>
<p>Mai Dinghua, the President of the Wuhu District Court, was ordered to be transferred to the Baoding Court President Zhu Huanbiao. It was unexpected that Mai was accused by his staff of deducting salaries, and he immediately left Wuhu for other places. The court staff then telegraphed the High Court to report it. The High Court stated that Baoding Court President Zhu was very willing to come to Anhui, and the Wuhu Court could not be without someone responsible. It has appointed Xu Enhai, the Chief Justice of the Civil Division of the High Court, to come to Wuhu yesterday to act as the President of the Wuhu Court. (30th)</p>

<p>Detailed Report on the Fire in Zhoupu Town: At 9:15 p.m. the day before yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the Lu Tonghe Basket Shop next to the Second Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau on Zhuhang Street in Zhoupu Town. Although the town's Fire Brigade rushed to put out the fire with a western-style fire engine, the fire was so fierce that it was difficult to extinguish, resulting in the burning of the two-story building in front of the Second Sub-Bureau (containing one five-shot quick-firing gun, two nine-shot Mauser rifles, one pistol, and dozens of rounds of ammunition used by the police, which could not be retrieved and were also destroyed), Shen Yongji's Palm Bed Shop, Kang Xingxing's Woodworking Yard, Sanxing Car Shop across the street, Lu Tonghe's Workshop, the residences of Ji Jingen and others, Tang Ai's Ready-Made Clothes Shop, and Chen Yingchang's Basket Shop. The fire was finally extinguished at 10:00 p.m., destroying more than ten buildings, totaling 28 two-story and one-story buildings, with losses estimated at more than 30,000 yuan. An elderly woman and a girl in Lu Tonghe's shop were also burned to death. It was learned that the cause of the fire was that Lu Laifu, the owner of Lu Tonghe's shop, had a quarrel with his wife and threw a kerosene lamp on bamboo flowers. Because the shop was full of utensils, all of which were flammable, it was difficult to save the situation once it caught fire. Lu Laifu has been arrested by the Second Sub-Bureau and presented to the Public Security Bureau for transfer to the county for interrogation. Robbery and Murder Outside the West Gate: At the house of Zhu Shuzhou, a resident of the 97th Tu outside the West Gate, more than ten robbers suddenly came to rob last night. When Zhu Shuzhou heard the alarm, he quickly held a tool and went outside, intending to sound the gong to gather the crowd to resist the robbers. However, he was spotted by the robbers, who shot and killed Zhu. They then entered the room and searched, stealing gold ornaments, silver dollars, and other items, with losses estimated at more than 300 yuan.</p>

<p>(1) Women's Group: Liangjiang defeats West Girl's YMCA</p>
<p>25 to 16</p>
<p>(2) Men's Group: Mixed team loses to Pirates</p>
<p>44 to 25</p>
<p>The Chinese and Western charity basketball games in memory of the late basketball star Zhao Shiming were held last night at the China Basketball Stadium. With the four teams being elite forces, the competition was expected to be highly entertaining, so guests flocked to the stadium, filling it to capacity. As a result, the Liangjiang women's team defeated the West Girl's YMCA 25 to 16, and the Chinese mixed team lost to the West Qing Pirates team 44 to 25. A brief account is given below.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Thanks to Players and Guests <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>As the game was about to begin, Hao Boyang, a leading member of the Association for Advancement, entered the court and first thanked the players and spectators. He said that he was deeply grateful for everyone's participation in the game or for making a special trip to watch. The proceeds from the tickets would be donated to charitable organizations in memory of Zhao Shiming.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Liangjiang defeats West Girl's YMCA <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Overall View: After Hao Boyang finished speaking, the two women's teams began their contest. Xi Jun, the center of Liangjiang, opened the scoring with an extremely agile move, breaking the basket with a pass from Shao Jinying. Xi Jun continued to score, and in the first quarter, Liangjiang took a 6-2 lead. Subsequently, the West Girl's YMCA scored three points with three consecutive free throws. Shao Jinying retaliated, and Liangjiang won the first half 9-5. In the second half, the West Girl's YMCA made some changes, but due to Liangjiang's close monitoring, they still could not improve. Xi Jun showed great skill, and the final score was 25 to 16. Referee: Shu Hong.</p>
<p>Team Performance: Liangjiang's performance was commendable. No one was more agile than Xi Jun, and Shao Jinying was a flexible forward. The best of the defenders were Zhuang, Wang, and Yang Ren. The talent of the defenders as forwards was only seen as a lack of strength, and too much back-and-forth passing led to missed opportunities, which was a pity. The West Girl's YMCA had courage but lacked strategy. The turning techniques were not yet mastered, and inaccurate shooting was a major problem.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Mixed Team Loses to Pirates <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Great Momentum: After the women's group, the two men's teams began to compete. Initially, the Chinese mixed team had great momentum. Although Smith first scored a long shot, the Chinese center Wei Haiqing countered with a steal and scored, and Wei scored again, immediately surpassing the Pirates. However, Smith's probing shots were incredible, and he scored thirteen points in a row, while the mixed team only had six points.</p>
<p>Enemy Rampant: The mixed team requested a timeout and then fought again. The enemy's momentum was still unstoppable. Nu Chao was fierce and unstoppable. Smith and Shia responded to each other and created a score of 18 to 6. Kong Guangyi entered the game, and the situation eased slightly. The Pirates won the first half 22 to 8.</p>
<p>Slight Shift: In the second half, the Pirates' three forwards were still fierce. Although the mixed team replaced Li Chengyuan with Tan Da and changed to a defensive strategy, the Pirates' momentum was still rampant. Until the score became 34 to 11, the mixed team's three forwards Tan, Liang, and Wei scored four points in a row, making the score 34 to 19. In the end, the wind was small and the strength was weak, and it was useless.</p>
<p>No Way to Save: Just hoping for a turnaround, Sullivan lurked like a tiger, and the five Pirates players came one after another. There was no way to save the situation. The Chinese mixed team lost 44 to 25. Referees: Zhang Guoxun, Wanfu. The mixed team's defeat was due to the fact that they gathered temporarily and lacked coordination, and they only focused on offense without paying attention to defense, allowing Smith and others to sweep the entire court, which was a pity.</p>

<p>(1) After the Shanghai Race Club Members' Club announced the Ping Pong Champagne Cup Finals news, people from all walks of life flocked to obtain tickets, creating a scene reminiscent of the road to Shanyin. However, the Cup Competition Organizing Committee, due to the limited space of the Ningbo Fellow Provincials Association, in order to maintain order, the number of tickets prepared was not large. The distribution of tickets was also regulated. Each team participating in the Cup Competition was given ten tickets, and all others were declined. However, there were still those who wanted to obtain tickets as an exception, which was difficult to grant. The committee asked for understanding from all sectors. In addition to Zhao Fang Photo Studio and the club, Chen Shaofeng, the director of the Association of Fellow Provincials at the North Railway Station, is now also entrusted to sell tickets so that those who wish to watch the ball game can purchase them nearby. According to the rules of the Ningbo Fellow Provincials Association, tickets cannot be sold on site, so tickets will not be sold at the time of the competition. Spectators are advised to prepare them early to avoid a wasted trip.</p>

<p>To the Chambers of Commerce of Provinces, Cities, and Counties: The Chamber of Commerce of Shanghai telegraphed on the 1st, saying: "We, the Chambers of Commerce of all provinces, cities, and counties, have been repeatedly ordered by the Executive Yuan and our municipal government to investigate and deal with the year-end closing of the national calendar, considering it a key measure for promoting the national calendar. Previously, according to the requests of various industries, we suggested extending the deadline to the day before the Beginning of Spring, but the Social Affairs Bureau rejected this proposal in detail at each level. This approval has also been published in various newspapers in this city. It can be generally seen that it is imperative. Recently, however, we have received telegrams from various chambers of commerce, all of which suggest that our chamber is still arguing for an extension. This shows a lack of clear understanding of the government's purpose of actively promoting the national calendar, leading to this divergence of opinions. Furthermore, the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce recently proposed to extend the deadline to February 16th, the date of the completion of grain transportation, as the date for the closing of accounts. However, this proposal was collectively discussed by the 39 chambers of commerce of Jiangsu Province and submitted to the central and provincial governments for approval and implementation. Currently, this case has not been formally approved by the central government. Therefore, it is currently difficult to adopt the extension to the completion of grain transportation. There are very few days left until the legal closing date, and various chambers of commerce and industries may still hold on to this wait-and-see attitude. We are deeply concerned that the result of procrastination may affect the market and accounting firms. Therefore, we are specifically telegraphing to declare that we hope to immediately inform businesses to prepare within the year and avoid any further hesitation. This would be greatly appreciated.

<p>The Chinese Overseas Association received a letter yesterday from the Chinese General Chambers of Commerce in Singapore, Penang, Malacca, Selangor, Perak, Kuala Lumpur, Muar, Bentong, Kuantan, Mentekab, and other ports, stating: "Our chambers of commerce have jointly submitted a document to the National Government, saying: 'We respectfully report that after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs promulgated the Provisional Measures for Issuing Passports for Leaving the Country and Issuing Passports for Returning to the Country by Overseas Embassies and Consulates, overseas Chinese groups at home and abroad have felt distressed and have fiercely opposed and striven for their repeal. Our joint association, after investigating the flaws in the two measures, has listed several points for reference and has raised the reasons for petitioning for their cancellation as follows: (1) The passport fee is six yuan per passport and the stamp duty is two yuan. Those who leave the country without a passport will not be protected. Passports were originally intended to prove nationality so that our embassies and consulates abroad could provide protection in accordance with the treaties. Why should additional fees be charged? The situation of overseas Chinese is also different from ordinary inspections, investigations, travels, and businesses. Our people are troubled by food and clothing or suffer from various disasters, and there is no room for them in the interior. Those who bear to leave their parents, wives, and children and flee to foreign countries are all doing so out of desperation. Their travel expenses are either borrowed or begged for, or even obtained by selling their property and children. How can they bear the heavy burden of additional expenses in such a dire situation? This is not feasible, point one. (2) Applicants for passports for leaving the country should first fill out a form for applying for a passport for leaving the country. Applicants for ordinary passports should also submit a request letter along with the following guarantee documents and submit them to the passport issuing authority for approval. Those leaving the country to do business should submit a guarantee letter from the local chamber of commerce or two reputable firms and certify the amount of their capital. Those leaving the country to work should submit a guarantee letter from the local labor union or two reputable firms and certify their work skills. Most overseas Chinese leave the country because of poverty or are driven by local communists. They have no belongings of their own. How can such poor people obtain a guarantor? It is difficult to find a small shop, let alone two reputable firms. Such a method makes it impossible for the poor to live and forces them to die in ditches. The strong ones become bandits. This is not feasible, point two. (3) Collecting passport fees for returning to the country is the same as for leaving the country. Overseas Chinese suffer various harsh regulations in various countries, such as entry taxes or head taxes, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not been able to alleviate their suffering. Now, it wants to collect a return passport fee of eight yuan when overseas Chinese return to their country. The external department calls it protection, but the overseas Chinese view it as an increase in taxation. This is not feasible, point three. (4) Replacing passports and paying taxes every year. Although countries generally have procedures for citizens to apply for passports for leaving and returning to the country, there is no precedent for replacing passports every year. Now the external department has stipulated replacing passports every year, and its intention is only to collect fees every year. What crime have overseas Chinese committed to be subjected to such heavy exploitation? This is not feasible, point four. (5) Applicants for passports for returning to the country should have their passport at the time of leaving the country inspected before being approved for issuance. Overseas Chinese may have left the country decades ago or before the promulgation of harsh regulations and have not obtained a passport. How can they have a passport to be inspected? Such a method directly aims to prevent overseas Chinese who left the country without a passport from having any way to return. This is not feasible, point five. The above five points are only the most extreme and cruel ones. There are other difficult places to implement that are difficult to list. Our government upholds Sun Yat-sen's legacy and aims to abolish unequal treaties with foreign countries. Why hasn't there been any reduction in the harsh regulations of the host country, but harsh regulations for overseas Chinese to obtain passports for leaving and returning to the country have appeared first? The two measures for applying for passports have no effect on the protection of overseas Chinese. It is simply the Ministry of Foreign Affairs calculating that with the number of overseas Chinese leaving the country exceeding one million annually and the number of overseas Chinese residing in various countries exceeding ten million, if they all comply with the measures for obtaining and replacing passports, the government will have tens of millions of yuan in revenue each year. However, it does not consider that overseas Chinese who flee the country have no way to return, and those who are oriented towards the country have no way to enter. What is the meaning of the Principle of People's Livelihood? What is the meaning of protecting overseas Chinese? Our joint association believes that these two measures are closely related to the interests of our overseas Chinese and cannot remain silent and allow the devastation of harsh chapters and tyrannical regulations. Moreover, the Chinese General Chambers of Commerce and various overseas Chinese groups in the Malay Peninsula have sent letters and telegrams one after another, loudly calling for and vowing to strive for the cancellation of the two measures for leaving and returning to the country. We humbly request that the National Government approve and order the external department to withdraw its order to comply with public opinion. This would be a great act of kindness. Respectfully submitted to the Chairman of the National Government, Chiang Kai-shek.

<p>Opinions of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce after the abolition of Likin</p>
<p>Road Goods Tax and Postal Parcel Tax Should Be Abolished Simultaneously</p>
<p>Rectification of Resolutions of the Five-Province Conference on Likin Abolition</p>
<p>Business Tax Rate Should Not Exceed Two Per Thousand</p>
<p>The Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang decided to abolish Likin on January 1, 1931. The Ministry of Finance is currently rushing to complete various procedures to ensure its implementation on schedule without delay. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency, considering this matter of great importance to the business community, interviewed Mr. Tu Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to inquire about the Chamber's opinions on the implementation of Likin abolition. According to Mr. Wang, merchants have long yearned for the abolition of Likin. They are delighted that the government can resolutely implement it. However, whether the abolition will be thorough and how to remedy it are also matters of great concern. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce specifically tasked the Standing Committee members Tu Yansong, Xu Ji, Ye Huijun, Yuan Ludeng, the Head of the General Affairs Section Fang Jiaobo, the Director of the General Affairs Section Luo Qinghua, the Secretary Yan Ersheng, and the Secretary-General Xiang Chengqing to conduct a detailed study and decided to make a thorough and urgent request to the Ministry of Finance to enable merchants to benefit from the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session, and to send letters to Chambers of Commerce in all provinces, cities, and counties to ensure a consistent position. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Document to the Ministry of Finance: A petition for urgent and detailed planning regarding the abolition of Likin and compensatory measures to avoid negative consequences. We humbly submit our opinions for your review and implementation. The abolition of Likin has been repeatedly ordered and scheduled for implementation since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, but has been suspended due to frequent military conflicts. Recently, with the gradual pacification of You, Yan, Bian, and Luo, the Fourth Plenary Session decided to implement Likin abolition on January 1, 1931. This resolution, weighing the situation, is unlikely to change. This is indeed a great opportunity for merchants to look forward to sweeping away cumbersome taxes and removing long-hanging burdens. However, considering that hundreds of thousands of people are involved in Likin, and that the national finances are strained and in dire need of resources after the military conflicts, it is imperative to plan for compensatory measures. We fear that hasty planning may lead to unintended consequences, where the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. This would be contrary to the government's intention to start afresh with the people and the merchants' initial hope for Likin abolition. Therefore, we dare to offer our humble opinions for the Ministry's consideration. The so-called Likin taxes had specific names and established procedures. However, provinces later acted independently, focusing on maximizing revenue to expand their armies and enrich themselves. As a result, the newly added taxes were bizarre and unfamiliar, making it difficult for merchants from other provinces to understand and even for the Ministry to keep track of. Taking the recent case of the Wing On Textile Company transporting goods to Chongqing and requesting exemption from double taxation as an example, the Provincial Department of Finance replied to the Ministry stating that they had strictly ordered the tax bureaus to prevent double taxation. However, the 21st Army Commander of the province, in his reply to the Chongqing General Chamber of Commerce on behalf of the company's request, stated that the company should be exempt from the Chongqing Consolidated Tax, following the example of the Hubei Yuhua Textile Company, but that all other pooled taxes should be paid. The so-called Chongqing Consolidated Tax is the province's official Likin, while the other taxes are the province's privately added Likin. The phrase "other taxes" clearly demonstrates the multitude of names and the complexity of the types of taxes, which burden merchants many times more than Likin itself. Previously, machine-made imitation foreign goods, after paying export tax, could pass through the entire country without being subject to any further taxes, except for the Chongwen Dou Tax Bureau. However, now, after several months, the Provincial Department of Finance's reply to the Ministry is outwardly compliant, but in reality, the province has its own tax regulations. The Ministry's regulations on exempting machine-made foreign goods from double taxation have long been disregarded in the reply to the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce, citing only Sichuan Province as an example. Other similar cases are too numerous to mention. We fear that after Likin abolition, only the officially reported Likin will be abolished, while the other privately added, bizarrely named taxes, similar to Likin, will continue to exist, with the Ministry having no records to rely on. Other provinces may rely on this as a source of revenue, either concealing it or protecting it by any means. In this case, merchants will not receive the benefits of Likin abolition and will instead face additional burdens. Therefore, we urge the Ministry to take swift and decisive action to thoroughly eliminate these taxes. First, the Ministry must bring the finances of all provinces back on track to prevent them from protecting Likin in disguise. Only then can the true purpose of Likin abolition be achieved. This is our first request. The abolition of Likin should include all taxes similar in nature to transit taxes. According to the resolution of the previous Likin Abolition Conference, the following should be abolished in addition to Likin: (1) Railway Goods Tax, (2) Postal Parcel Tax, (3) Customs Duties and surcharges beyond ten li of the business port, (4) Import Duties and surcharges of new maritime and land customs, (5) Re-import Duties and surcharges of new maritime and land customs, (6) Export Duties and surcharges of new maritime and land customs from this port to that port, (7) Customs Duties and surcharges within fifty li of the business port. The current implementation of Likin abolition is to complete the unfinished work of the previous Likin Abolition Conference. All previous resolutions, which accommodated the requests of the business community and were carefully formulated, should be adhered to. We urge the Ministry to abolish Likin, Goods Tax, and Landing Tax on January 1 of next year. The remaining seven similar taxes, excluding items three to seven, should be abolished in stages following the previous resolution. The Railway Goods Tax and Postal Parcel Tax, which are most harmful to businesses, should be abolished simultaneously on January 1 of next year to ensure the early implementation of policies that benefit businesses. This is our second request. Next is the issue of compensatory measures. The discussion of Likin abolition in our country began in the Renyin year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. The proposed compensatory measures included increasing import duties to 2.5% of the value, and the remaining measures only included production and sales taxes and factory taxes, which are similar to the special consumption taxes discussed recently. Currently, the most important import tariff, based on the current tariff rates, is already 27.5% of the value, and we have heard that the upcoming revised tariff rates will also have some increases, which is more than double the old treaty of Renyin. In addition, according to the resolution of the previous Likin Abolition Conference, there are also business taxes and special consumption taxes as compensatory measures. This should be more than enough to make up for the shortfall. Merchants hope that Likin abolition will reduce their burden. If there are any short-sighted individuals who propose levying new types of taxes as compensatory measures, we urge the Ministry to consider the people's hardships and not adopt such proposals. This is our third request. The main points of the guidelines for the implementation of special consumption taxes, as resolved in the previous conference, are: (1) One tax per item, such as refunding the cocoon tax after paying the silk tax; (2) One tax valid nationwide; (3) The tax rate for special consumption taxes in place of Likin should not be higher than the original tax rate; (4) Taxes must be levied on the major products of the region; otherwise, no taxes should be levied. Only by adhering to these four principles can we avoid disguised and intensified taxes. Among the provinces that implemented special consumption taxes earlier, Jiangxi and Fujian provinces were at the forefront. However, judging from the current situation in these two provinces, the hardships of the merchants have worsened compared to before the abolition of Likin. Taking the Jiangxi Finance Special Commissioner's Office's reply to the Jiangxi Chamber of Commerce Federation in November of the 18th year as an example, after examining it item by item, it can be seen that the province has not fully implemented the refund of double taxation. For example, regarding oil producers, if they produce oil from soybeans, once a tax refund is issued, it will inevitably lead to mutual borrowing of tax tickets and other malpractices, as stated in the strict reply. Goods imported from other provinces and not sold in Jiangxi Province are still required to pay taxes. This is tantamount to completely overturning the principles established in the implementation guidelines for special consumption taxes. On the one hand, the province is using the name of consumption tax to increase tax rates to over 15% of the value. All these situations show that merchants have not benefited from Likin abolition and have instead suffered from the harm of Likin abolition. We will not discuss the completed cases of Jiangxi and Fujian for the time being and will instead study the resolution of the Five-Province Conference on Likin Abolition. Item Ren of the resolution states that when collecting special taxes and consumption taxes, goods that are easy to produce and sell and levy taxes at the same time should be levied at once. However, if it is more convenient to levy taxes separately, methods can also be devised to levy taxes separately. This leaves room for future tax cards and difficulties. The provision in the implementation guidelines for special consumption taxes that one tax is valid nationwide is considered worthless. Although Likin tax rates varied from province to province in the past, they were mostly between 2% and 5%. The name "Likin" itself implies that the ratio should not be too high. Although the total tax rate for goods passing through several provinces sometimes reached 20% or 30%, the tax rate for goods sold only in the province or nearby provinces was not very high. The implementation guidelines for special consumption taxes clearly stipulate that after changing to special taxes, the tax rate should not exceed the original tax rate, although there is a clause stating that luxury goods are not subject to this rule. However, there is room for deliberation on the categories and tax rates. This is why the implementation guidelines for special consumption taxes stipulate that the financial authorities must consult with commercial organizations before deciding on the collection method of special consumption taxes. However, the Five-Province Conference on Likin Abolition hastily decided on a maximum tax rate of 17.5% of the value based solely on the opinions of government officials. The determination of what constitutes luxury goods and semi-luxury goods is entirely based on the reports and verification of each province, without any input from commercial organizations. This is in stark contrast to the guidelines. The implementation guidelines for special consumption taxes stipulate that each place that must levy taxes can only set up one consumer tax bureau to preside over the matter and must not set up a bureau for each category of goods. However, the Five-Province Conference on Likin Abolition has implicitly changed this rule. Goods of the same nature and with similar collection procedures, as well as goods with small amounts of revenue, should be taxed in the same place and managed by one bureau. However, in the initial stage, large quantities of goods can also be taxed according to category. According to the above regulations, oil and seafood, wood and livestock are not of the same nature and can always be taxed according to category. More agencies mean more expenses for the government, and more categories of bureaus mean more inspections for merchants, which is more troublesome than the previous unified collection and inspection of all kinds of Likin. In short, the implementation guidelines for special consumption taxes were formulated by the government after accommodating the opinions of the business community during the Likin Abolition Conference. After careful consideration, there were good points. However, once the Five-Province Conference on Likin Abolition made implicit changes, all the good points were virtually abolished. Therefore, the reform of special taxes in other provinces feels more painful than Likin. Learning from the past, we are truly frightened. The reform of special taxes in this Likin abolition is not comparable to the partial trials in Jiangxi and other provinces. The impact on the entire country will be significant if we are not careful. We urge the Ministry to strictly implement the guidelines for special consumption taxes. All resolutions of the Five-Province Conference on Likin Abolition that conflict with these guidelines should be abolished and rectified. The most important ones are: (1) Strictly adhere to the principle of one tax per item and implement tax refunds for double taxation; (2) To facilitate nationwide validity after one tax, taxes should be levied at the place of production or concentration in one go and not in stages; (3) The determination of what constitutes luxury goods and semi-luxury goods should accommodate the opinions of commercial organizations when each province reports; (4) The Ministry should consider the commercial situation and reconvene a Likin Abolition Conference to jointly determine the highest tax rate for semi-luxury goods and luxury goods; (5) The collection method of special taxes in each province should consult with commercial organizations in advance according to the guidelines for special taxes. This is our fourth request. The business tax rate is determined according to the implementation guidelines for the collection of business tax in each province, with the highest tax rate being two per thousand. Although each province can formulate its own flexible measures, the tax rate levied cannot be higher than the provisions of the outline, and the restrictions are extremely strict. However, Jiangsu Province levied the business registration fee in advance before the abolition of Likin, with the highest rate reaching five per thousand. This means that once Likin is abolished and the business tax is formally reformed, the tax rate will exceed the scope. If Jiangsu Province does this, it is difficult to guarantee that other provinces will not follow suit. This is our fifth request to the Ministry for correction. The first two items concern whether Likin can be thoroughly abolished, and the latter three concern the need to avoid harsh burdens when compensating for the abolition of Likin. We hereby submit our humble opinions and request the Ministry to review and approve them separately for the benefit of all. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Letter to All Chambers of Commerce: We are writing to inform you that the government has scheduled Likin abolition for January 1, 1931, and whether the abolition can be thorough and whether the compensation can avoid disguised Likin are both important keys. If the planning is not careful, the impact will be significant. Our Chamber, in order to fulfill its duty and alleviate the suffering of merchants, submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Finance yesterday with some suggestions. We are enclosing a copy of the proposal for your review. If you believe it is reasonable, please make a joint request. If you have other opinions, please submit them to the Ministry separately. This will ensure that the long-cherished desire of merchants for Likin abolition can be realized. We are truly grateful.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Water Price Issues in the Concession <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Real Estate Association's Important Letter Shanghai Real Estate Association yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Concession Taxpayers Association of Chinese, stating, "We have received your letter of November 29th, enclosing a copy of the audit report of the Shanghai Waterworks Company's accounts and requesting our opinion. Upon review, we find that the audit was conducted through the efforts of your representatives, Mr. He Dejun, Mr. Pan Xulun, and Mr. Yu Xigen. We are deeply grateful and ask you to convey our respects and appreciation to them. As for the accounting of the 25% surcharge collected by the Shanghai Waterworks Company, we absolutely cannot approve it. Please allow us to state our reasons as follows: (1) From the principle of contract law, users have absolutely no obligation to fulfill the interest guarantee in the contract signed between the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Shanghai International Settlement and the British Shanghai Waterworks Company. The Water Company's desire to collect a surcharge is to compensate for the interest guaranteed by the Municipal Council in the current contract signed with the Water Company on March 17, 1928. Fulfilling this interest guarantee responsibility should be borne by the Municipal Council, who signed the contract and made the guarantee, and absolutely not by third-party users (i.e., customers). The Municipal Council may believe that the right to sign this contract was granted by the taxpayers, and users are taxpayers, so the interest guarantee should naturally be borne by the users. Regardless of whether users and taxpayers are two separate identities that cannot be combined into one, even if users are taxpayers, increasing the burden on taxpayers should naturally be decided by the taxpayers' meeting. Furthermore, interest guarantees should be paid by the national treasury if approved by the central government and by the municipal treasury if approved by the municipal government. This is the only principle in financial administration. There is absolutely no precedent for any industrial or commercial enterprise or public utility to charge customers for interest guarantees. Otherwise, what is the use of interest guarantees? The government's interest guarantee to enterprises is to protect investors from being unprofitable on the one hand and to protect consumers from high prices on the other hand. (2) From the principle of interest guarantees, the Shanghai Waterworks Company has no need for interest guarantees under the current circumstances. According to the principle that laws should not be retroactive mentioned in the first item, this item should not be damaged. However, people will inevitably say that this is an established contract and cannot be established before the contract signed between the Municipal Council and the Water Company is changed according to the principle that laws should not be retroactive. In reality, this is not the case. Waterworks are public utilities and monopolistic operations for the benefit of all residents. In this prosperous area, supply and demand have long been adapted, and there is absolutely no need to worry about attracting and consolidating capital. Before 1917, the Water Company was not guaranteed interest by the Municipal Council and was instead subject to price restrictions. The Water Company did not face any problems of being unsustainable. Furthermore, the reason why interest guarantees should not be borne by third-party users has been stated in the first item above. If the Municipal Council pays, this interest guarantee that increases the burden on taxpayers should be decided by the taxpayers' meeting. (3) After carefully reading the audit report, the issuance of bonus shares has greatly deviated from the principle of public utilities. Bonus shares are transformed from the Water Company's public reserve fund and distributed to shareholders. If we assume that the annual interest rate is 5%, the company has annual income, but now it has become bonus shares, and the company must have annual expenses. Calculating the current interest rate at 5%, the Water Company loses a total of 1.4% of annual interest, totaling 27,311 pounds and 4 shillings in British currency. It is unreasonable for a monopolistic waterworks company to give away its assets to shareholders. Secondly, the Water Company's A shares can be sold for about 25 pounds on the London market. Calculating at 25 pounds, the annual interest rate on the London interest rate market is about 7.2%, but this is a monopolistic operation with little need for outside investment. Its interest rate should naturally be lower than the market interest rate for various government bonds and real estate, which do not have to worry about significant losses. Thirdly, the dividend and bonus records only cover 15 years, but the average is 1.121%. The most questionable aspect is that in the two years of 1928 and 1929 under the so-called interest guarantee, shareholders' income was above 1%. Is the so-called interest guarantee of 9% guaranteeing more than 9%? Fourthly, under the so-called interest guarantee, the Water Company's expenses increased dramatically compared to under the price restriction. Even if the increase in production and consumption is maintained at the same rate, it is not in line with scientific principles. Water is not a product with many varieties. As production increases, the cost should naturally decrease. Even if prices are affected, the increase in water production should only be about 20%, while the increase in expenses is as high as 43%. It cannot be said that the Water Company is not abusing and wasting money under the so-called interest guarantee. (4) Exchange rate fluctuations are an irresistible natural disaster. The Water Company benefited from this before 1919. This time, the Water Company should suffer the loss. The Municipal Council, as the contracting party, has no need to bear the risk of this exchange rate fluctuation. This is a common principle applicable to the performance of any contract. In summary, in the current situation, the interest guarantee should be paid directly by the contracting party, the Municipal Council. In the future, the Municipal Council should revise this contract. The main points are: (1) Under the current currency system in our country, the company's capital should be calculated in silver, and the exchange rate should be the average of the last ten years. (2) Abolish the interest guarantee and restore price restrictions, and limit the interest rate. (3) All bonus shares and the property of the waterworks equipment company should be recovered and returned to the Water Company or even to the Municipal Council for the benefit of the public. Otherwise, the interest should be suspended, and the company should gradually recover them at face value. (4) Chinese directors should be added to the Water Company to supervise its operations. Since there are only foreign directors now, we are sending this letter to request your review, consideration, and adoption. Furthermore, we are extremely grateful for your hard work in the audit task.</p>
<p>Qian Chengxu's Opinion Guowen News Agency reported that their reporter interviewed Mr. Qian Chengxu, a member of the China Industrial Federation, yesterday to inquire about his legal opinions on the recent price increase by the Shanghai Waterworks Company. Mr. Qian replied that from a legal standpoint, there are three main parties involved in this case: the Municipal Council, the Water Company, and the users. Among the three, the users are not parties to the contract, so they cannot recognize its regulations regarding the price increase issue. The reporter asked for an explanation of the principle. Qian replied that in the past, the company's fees were calculated according to the house price, and the supply and demand relationship allowed the two parties to agree on the scope. Since the Municipal Council guaranteed the company's dividends on January 17, 1918, the Municipal Council has been in a responsible position. Therefore, at any time, if the company's income is not enough to pay its interest, the Municipal Council must pay the shortfall itself. This is because the Municipal Council guaranteed it, not the users. In short, the Municipal Council, as a party to the contract, should be responsible, and the users, who are not parties to the contract, should not bear the responsibility for the guarantee. The reporter further inquired about the legal basis for the Municipal Council's interest guarantee and approval of the price increase. Qian replied that public utilities in cities in various countries are usually managed by the municipal government. The government must promote the establishment of a company in sparsely populated areas with underdeveloped commerce and industry if its income is not enough to cover its expenses. Under these circumstances, the government can guarantee its stock interest or provide profitable goals, aiming to encourage general investment. However, after carefully examining the company's operating conditions from 1915 to 1918 (the year the Municipal Council provided the interest guarantee), its average interest had already exceeded 1.23%. Its level of development had also reached its peak. What principle did the Municipal Council use to provide a double guarantee beyond the 20-year patent? This is something I deeply disagree with. As for the approval of the price increase, I have already stated its principle. The Municipal Council, having assumed this major economic responsibility at the time, believed that it had reliable financial resources and would have special methods to provide financial support in the future. Now, without any support, it first removes its guarantee responsibility and then rashly approves the company's price increase, taking compensation for its gold price loss from the general users. This is something the Municipal Council should not have done. In short, the Municipal Council is the center of today's negotiations. From its position, the Municipal Council was able to approve the company's request to increase prices in the past, so why can't it approve the users' request to reduce prices today? Users residing in the concession have always been treated differently. Regarding this matter, the Shanghai Real Estate Association, the Concession Taxpayers Association of Chinese, and various industrial and commercial organizations can submit counter-proposals to the Municipal Council to continue their strong advocacy.</p>

<p>Request for Funding to Assist Sichuan Silk Sichuan silk merchants' representatives, including Li Kuian and more than ten others, believed that Sichuan silk had reached its limit due to the restriction of Japanese silk and the heavy exploitation of various taxes and levies. They took the opportunity to attend the Industrial and Commercial Conference to petition the National Government and the two ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce to allocate public bonds for the silk industry to save Sichuan silk from decline. Yesterday, Mr. Li and others took an early express train to Beijing. Those who saw them off at the station included dozens of representatives from the National Federation of Commerce and the Sichuan Silk Merchants in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Seeks Opinions on Freight Rates from Various Industries <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Preparing to Submit to the Railway Freight Rate Conference The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent letters to all industries in the city, forwarded by the Municipal Government, regarding the Railway Department's consultation. The railway freight rate is extremely important. Whether the freight rate is appropriate is not only related to the prosperity and decline of the railway business, but also has a significant impact on the national economy, people's livelihood, industrial development, and commercial prosperity. The freight rates of various state-owned railways in our country have been implemented for more than ten years. Due to the changing times, the freight rates are actually no longer very applicable. In order to maintain the railway business and develop industry and commerce, it is necessary to revise the freight rates. The Ministry has now scheduled to convene a National Railway Freight Rate Conference on the 15th of next month, inviting representatives from various railways and relevant agencies such as the Ministries of Finance, Interior, Military Affairs, Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce, as well as provincial and municipal governments and local chambers of commerce, to revise the current freight rates. Therefore, we consult your government to check whether it is appropriate to send personnel to attend at that time and to first instruct the chambers of commerce under your jurisdiction to thoroughly investigate, review, and submit the production and sales of agricultural products, industries, and other goods in each place, the conditions of water and land transportation, and opinions on the railway freight rates specified to the Ministry before December 20 of this year to be used as the basis for the conference. Also instruct personnel to attend at that time to collect the benefits of broad thinking. This matter concerns the national economy and the people's livelihood. Please promptly transfer and handle it. The freight rates charged by the railway vary, and the situation of each industry is also different. It is considered that there are places that should be revised. It is better to seek opinions from each industry and submit detailed statements, and then compile and report them to the association, which is easier to obtain the main points than in a conference. We hereby send a letter to inform you and hope that you will report in detail on the current railway freight rates of your industry's goods and whether there are any improvements to be made within seven days of receiving this letter so that we can compile and forward them. This is extremely important.</p>

<p>Saying There is No Need to Panic A reporter from the Great America Evening Post yesterday (the 1st) interviewed many foreign exchange brokers and financial experts to ask for their opinions on the silver market. They all said that there is no need to panic about the current sharp decline in silver prices. It is expected that the market will fall for a few more weeks, but unless the world economic situation continues to deteriorate and becomes more depressed than it is now, the silver market will definitely rebound. It seems that the recent drop in silver prices will not have a significant impact on the standard of living, and it is expected that the silver market will rebound in the next few days. After stabilizing for a while, it may fall again. In short, the silver market in this port is entirely dependent on the European and American markets. If the European and American economic situation improves, the silver price will definitely rise. Otherwise, if the market situation of general goods is not good, the silver price will also fall sharply. As for the cost of living in this port, it will probably be affected after the silver price falls by one or two cents. At that time, imports will decrease sharply, and prices will rise again, or even rise by about 10%.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Yesterday's Banquet for Mr. Ohtani by Five Organizations <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Hopes of Five Organizations</p>
<p>Mr. Ohtani's Response</p>
<p>Yesterday at 12 noon, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the Money Exchange Association, the Shipping Association, and the Lumber Merchants' Association hosted a banquet at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce in honor of Mr. Ohtani, a leader in American shipping and lumber industries. Over forty people attended, including Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Hu Mengjia, Qin Runqing, Zhu Yinjiang, Huang Renzhi, Shou Jingwei, Zhao Shifu, Lin Kanghou, Xu Xinliu, and Yuan Ludeng. After the meal, Yu Qiaqing, the chairman, rose and first mentioned that Mr. Ohtani had provided significant support for the establishment of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce thirty or forty years ago. At that time, he also proposed the establishment of a Sino-American joint venture bank and shipping company, but unfortunately, it did not come to fruition. However, in these thirty years, Mr. Ohtani's own shipping and lumber businesses have achieved great success. Today, he raised a toast to celebrate and hoped that everyone present would be encouraged to achieve great success in their respective businesses like Mr. Ohtani. Next, Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the five organizations. Mr. Ohtani then gave his response. The two speeches are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Welcome Speech by the Five Organizations: It briefly stated that Mr. Ohtani's business, particularly in lumber and shipping, has long been highly respected. He has a deep affection for the Chinese business community and has maintained close relationships for many years. It has often been heard that in his dealings with Chinese businesses over the years, involving millions of transactions, he has never experienced any unexpected losses, and no debts have ever been shortchanged. He serves as a model for businessmen. Mr. Ohtani is truly one of the most knowledgeable individuals regarding Chinese business conditions. The prosperity of commerce between the two countries must be based on mutual trust between the merchants of both nations. While Mr. Ohtani's success in Chinese commerce is due to various advantages, his spirit of mutual trust is undoubtedly one of the greatest reasons for his success. Our association not only hopes that Mr. Ohtani will maintain this spirit but also hopes to disseminate this concept widely among American merchants in China and, upon his return home, to contribute significantly to the American authorities. In doing so, Sino-American commerce will undoubtedly usher in a new era. The biggest obstacle to the U.S. State Department's hesitation in abolishing extraterritoriality in China is the concern that the abolition of extraterritoriality might affect the protection of American businesses in China. If Mr. Ohtani can use his decades of commercial experience in China to sincerely appeal to the American authorities, making them understand that Chinese merchants are the most honest and trustworthy, then the anxiety that the abolition of extraterritoriality would affect commercial security will naturally dissipate. Mr. Ohtani, at the advanced age of nearly ninety, has traveled across the ocean. If he can make this great contribution, it would be a lasting memorial in the history of Sino-American trade. We cannot help but have great expectations. Secondly, when we look back at Mr. Ohtani's history of success, it is indeed due to the words "perseverance and determination." This is especially a good model for us in China, where industrial and commercial undertakings are still in the process of construction. Even if we consider the origin of Mr. Ohtani's shipping business, he initially suffered significant losses because he entrusted others to transport lumber. He then reluctantly purchased a small, three-hundred-ton ship and transported it himself, eventually expanding to specialize in lumber transportation, leading to the establishment of the now-famous Ohtani Steamship Company. There is an ancient saying in our country: "The success of nine-ren starts with a pile of earth." How true that is. Recalling that our country had a shipping company called China Merchants Steam Navigation Company several years ago, which had three ships, the "China," "Nile," and "Nanjing," sailing between China and the United States, it failed and ceased operations after only a few years. Compared to Mr. Ohtani, who accumulated inch by inch from a small three-hundred-ton vessel to build a world-renowned shipping company, we are truly ashamed. Further, our country's merchants are known for being honest in their words, but they lack the experience in managing large-scale businesses. There is an ancient saying in our country: "The stones from other mountains can be used to polish jade," which means that friends have the obligation to exchange knowledge. Therefore, on the occasion of welcoming Mr. Ohtani today, we ask him, as a good friend and a senior, to share all his business experiences throughout his life with the financial and shipping circles present today, so that our organizations can use them as an aid to improving their businesses. His generous gift to our country's business community will be substantial indeed.</p>
<p>Mr. Ohtani's Response: Before I begin my collective response, there are a few words I must declare: I do not feel that I am associating with people from a foreign country when I am at your association today. I feel as if I am talking with old acquaintances from my own country. Based on this special feeling, it is only appropriate for me to address everyone as "old friends." Chairman Wang mentioned various points regarding Sino-American relations in his welcome speech. I am very willing to respond with simple and sincere words: I am willing to do my best in my remaining years to benefit China and its people. I can guarantee the business credit of the Chinese people. I have been doing business in China for decades and have never suffered any losses. Friendship is essential to mankind. If mankind has no friendship, how boring would life be? With the spirit of love, friendship, and trustworthiness of the Chinese people, coupled with unity of purpose and concerted efforts, I dare say that in twenty or thirty years, China will surely become the world's leading power and will naturally hold the reins of the business community of all countries. Please do not consider this flattery or an empty promise. This observation of mine comes from a sincere realization. Just as I have been away from Shanghai for three years and have returned to this place, the development of Shanghai has already leaped forward. But this hope must have a prerequisite issue, that is, to permanently end the war. I know that with the concerted efforts of everyone present here, there will be no more wars in China forever. Because I love it so much, I cannot help but speak so earnestly, so I add this point as an aside. I also visited various ministers during my trip to your country's capital and had a long conversation with Chairman Chiang. What I said was the same as what I said to you today. Chairman Chiang also told me that he deeply believed in what I said and would do his best to make it a reality. I know that in twenty or thirty years, I will meet with you again. At that time, you will say that the hopes Mr. Ohtani expressed in the past have all become reality today. Wouldn't that be great?</p>
<h3 id="e131">Ministry Approval for Exemption of Silk Reeling Tax for Zhejiang-Huzhou Silk Merchants <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly reported on the requests from Zhejiang-Huzhou silk merchant representatives Pan Run and Diao Zuolan to the Ministry of Finance for tax exemption on goods passing through various regions. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance has approved the silk reeling tax exemption, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Received the petition stating that Shanghai has a large inventory of raw silk and reeled silk, which is restricted by heavy taxes, resulting in limited commercial transportation in Shanghai. If tax exemption is allowed for imports, then the sale of raw silk and reeled silk in Shanghai can be promoted, and the silk workers in Huzhou can gradually resume work. The situation is indeed true. At present, the abolition of local duties is imminent. In order to promote domestic products and consider both sides, the Ministry hereby approves a temporary measure before the actual abolition of local duties. All Huzhou merchants who purchase raw silk and reeled silk from Shanghai should obtain certificates from the Wuxing Silk Weaving Association. After verification by various regions, if the goods match the certificate, tax exemption shall be granted. In addition to instructing the Jiangsu Financial Commissioner, the Zhejiang Department of Finance, to comply with this order, please submit a sample of the certificate form adopted by the association to the Ministry for record and compliance. This approval is hereby issued.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Protests Construction of Zhenru Radio Station <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The international radio station built by the Ministry of Communications in Zhenru has been completed and is scheduled to open on the 6th of this month. It was recently learned that this matter has suddenly aroused unreasonable interference from Japan. According to personnel from the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, during the Duan government era in the seventh year of the Republic of China, a Shuangqiao Radio Station contract was signed with Japan. This contract stipulated that Japan had exclusive rights to China's construction of radio stations. The Japanese believe that the Ministry of Communications' order to the United States for materials and loans to build the Zhenru radio station violates the old Shuangqiao contract and have expressed their protest. The Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, Shigemitsu Aoi, had previously submitted a protest letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Because the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet replied, the protest was continued yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Mr. and Mrs. You and Zhang Reconcile <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yiting and Yu Zhizhai exerted their utmost to mediate. A one-time subsidy of 5,000 yuan was given to compensate You Yahao's losses. Zhang Nai sent a letter of apology and assumed future alimony responsibilities. You Yahao's lawsuit has not yet been withdrawn.</p>
<p>The bigamous marriage case between You Yahao and Zhang Nai has caused a sensation in Shanghai since it occurred, attracting widespread attention. Now, with the utmost mediation of Mr. Wang Yiting, Pastor Yu Zhizhai, and others, and the letter from Mr. Wang Yiting and others to invite Ms. You's father, Gan Chen, to Shanghai, the matter has taken a sharp turn. As of the 30th of last month, both parties began discussing settlement terms. Zhang Nai himself voluntarily subsidized Ms. You with 5,000 yuan for expenses such as childbirth and litigation. Future living expenses would be subsidized at 30 yuan per month by Zhang Nai's elder brother, Yu Baoyuan, until Zhang Nai obtains employment. If Zhang Nai earns a salary of 150 yuan or less after obtaining employment, 60 yuan per month will be subsidized. If it exceeds 150 yuan, it will be increased accordingly. Zhang Ding formally sent a letter of apology to Ms. You's parents. Once the conditions proposed by Zhang Nai are fully fulfilled, Ms. You will withdraw the lawsuit from the court and resume cohabitation, with both parties reconciling as husband and wife. The settlement terms on You Yahao's side are entirely presided over by You's father, Gan Chen, and You Yahao has not been involved in the matter from beginning to end. However, You Yahao respects the mediation of the mediators and the opinions of her father and has therefore expressed her approval. However, as of today, Zhang Nai has only fulfilled the apology to Ms. You Yahao and her parents. As for the subsidized 5,000 yuan, Zhang Nai has raised it and stored it in a certain bank but has not handed it over, stating that it must wait until Zhang's conditions are fully fulfilled before the lawsuit can be formally withdrawn. You's father returned to his hometown yesterday. Ms. You and her son have been unwell in recent days and are accompanied by medicine stoves and teapots. The original letter of apology from Zhang Nai and the original certificate of the witness are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Zhang Nai's Original Letter: I respectfully address my esteemed parents-in-law. Since your daughter married me, she has served her mother-in-law dutifully, managed the household diligently and thriftily, and provided deep inner assistance. The relationship has been extremely harmonious. Now, due to my temporary confusion, I have caused a bigamous marriage dispute and legal proceedings. There are places in my court testimony that offend your daughter and do not conform to the facts. I have now realized my mistake and feel deeply ashamed. I sincerely express my apology to my esteemed parents-in-law and your daughter, and request your daughter's forgiveness so that we can remain husband and wife as before. In the future, we will always maintain harmony. I will fulfill my obligation to support your daughter and abide by the law without changing course midway. All household expenses, childbirth expenses, litigation expenses, etc., advanced by your daughter will be reimbursed by me with 5,000 yuan. The living expenses of your daughter and son should be borne by me forever. It is agreed that before I obtain employment, I will temporarily subsidize your daughter and son with 30 yuan per month. After I find employment, if the salary is 150 yuan or less, I will pay 60 yuan per month. If it exceeds 150 yuan, it will be increased accordingly, guaranteed by my elder brother. All the items stored at my elder sister's place will still be returned by my elder sister as before. I earnestly request my parents-in-law and your daughter to be generous and allow the civil and criminal lawsuits to be withdrawn, so that I may be grateful for the rest of my life. I respectfully wish you good health. Your son-in-law, Zhang Nai, bows on the 30th day of the 11th month of the 19th year.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Movement to Resist Japanese and Return Opium <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>A German ship was found to be carrying opium worth over one million. On the morning of the 20th of last month, the Jianghai Customs discovered one hundred boxes of opium weighing 19,400 pounds and worth one million yuan on the German cargo ship "Kroesso" at a pier next to the China Merchants Bureau's warehouse in Pudong. The opium was being smuggled by the Japanese, as reported earlier. It is now learned that the smuggling Japanese are using a lot of money to vigorously lobby in all directions, hoping to return the original goods. The Japanese authorities are also trying to find a way. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association learned of this matter. Due to the seriousness of the case, the Association is determined to exert all its efforts to resist the destruction of the drugs and thoroughly investigate the smugglers. In addition to investigating the actual situation to carry out the resistance, a special letter was sent to the Director of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Anti-Opium Committee, requesting that the opium be burned as soon as possible and that the personnel involved be investigated and the handling process be announced to the public to dispel doubts and emphasize the prohibition of opium. The original letter is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Dear Sirs, It has been found that the Shanghai newspapers of November 21 carried reports that the Jianghai Customs discovered a large amount of opium on the German cargo ship "Kroesso," amounting to more than 19,400 pounds and worth more than one million yuan. A confidential letter from the shipowner to the opium customs was found. Researching the sentences in the letter is sufficient to prove that the smugglers of the opium are Japanese. That country may file a protest. The opium is currently stored in the Jianghai Customs awaiting disposal. The foreign media also published similar reports on the 22nd. It has been found that foreign drugs have harmed our country for a century, killing compatriots, destroying production, and having a huge impact. Recently, the Jianghai Customs has repeatedly seized large quantities of drugs coming to China, and the quantity has been larger than ever before. The scale of the organization and the strictness of the planning are evident. It has recently been learned that the Japanese smugglers of opium are using huge sums of money to collude with corrupt officials and traveling between Beijing and Shanghai, vigorously lobbying in the hope of returning the drugs in order to achieve their conspiracy to poison China, and that a gang of people who are willing to sell their country are even more profit-oriented and are running errands for the Japanese in order to achieve the purpose of transporting the drugs. It has been found that Japanese smuggling of large quantities of opium has always been under the pretext of transporting it to Dalian to manufacture anesthetic drugs, but in reality, it is transported to Shanghai. Unfortunately, it was discovered by the customs, and they used this as an excuse to seek its return. Even if it is actually transported to Dalian to be made into anesthetic drugs, will not our compatriots still be poisoned? Even a three-foot child knows their trick of deceiving themselves and others. The evidence of this illegal smuggling is clear, but the Japanese are still trying to rely on money and diplomacy to coerce and lure our country's authorities. The danger of their intentions has long been seen by the people of the country. Our Association has been entrusted by the people to resist drugs as its duty, and it is difficult to remain silent in the face of this dark disaster that will destroy the country and exterminate the race. It is determined to completely eliminate it. It has previously sent letters to the Jianghai Customs Supervisor and Tax Commissioner to express its opinion and request that the drugs be burned as soon as possible, but it has not been implemented. If there are any greedy and lawless people who are willing to collude with the Japanese, our Association will sound the drums and attack them. If there are any who are upright and not afraid of public opinion, who are working for the welfare of the people and are not tempted or coerced by profit, our Association swears to be a backing. It is hereby requested that the Jianghai Customs be instructed to immediately propose the burning of the opium in order to prevent abuses, thoroughly investigate the persons involved in this case, and negotiate with the countries concerned to report the facts of the case to all the people of the country and the League of Nations. It is hoped that this will be investigated and handled.</p>

<p>The construction of the Pudong main road was scheduled to begin yesterday, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau was unable to attend the ceremony yesterday due to business, and specially commissioned Technician Zhou Zhengzan to represent the Bureau and inspect Pudong. Local dignitaries also attended the ceremony in large numbers, and were received by Zhang Renchun, director of the Pudong Engineering Management Office of the Bureau. At the same time, the Bureau requested the Public Security Bureau to order the first branch of the third district of Pudong to send five police officers to the scene to take care of the matter. The work started at 9:00 a.m. One hundred workers were divided into five teams, with three teams starting from Yujia Temple and heading south, and two teams heading north to start drawing lime circles and breaking ground. The Land Bureau also notified the land protection officer Yang Baobao of the map (map 23) to separately notify the landowners whose houses, tombs, or other buildings are included in the main road to quickly move them, and fill out the forms and submit them to the Land Bureau to receive subsidies. Yesterday, it was seen that many tombs nearby were automatically demolished by the tomb owners. It is said that the five police officers sent by the Public Security Bureau must be on the scene to take care of them before they can be withdrawn after three days.</p>

<p>The area outside Wusongkou and in front of Lvsiyang was occupied by bandits. Since the fire between the two leaders of the bandits, the Lvsiyang Sanjiazhen bandit case was wiped out by the land and water police taking advantage of the opportunity, as reported in this newspaper. However, many scattered bandits still hid in the surrounding coastal areas and harassed the area. At about 7:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, the Jinghua District Guard Corps learned that a small group of bandits was hiding in the home of Zhu Shunxiang, a villager in the northwest port of the coastal area, and immediately sent detectives to search for them. Shen Yuewen, Xu Zhimao, Lu Xiaogou, and seven other bandits were captured on the spot. After being taken to the regiment headquarters for strict interrogation, the bandits confessed that they were engaged in looting, kidnapping, and extortion, and claimed that there were about six or seven hundred bandits scattered along the coast. The regiment considered the confession to be true and executed the bandits by firing squad on the beach, and notified the police and regiments stationed in the coastal areas to be on high alert.</p>

According to the caregiver, the deceased was named Zhu Zhaoming, 39 years old, from Anhui, and lived at No. 5, Lane 53. He worked in the artillery shell department of the arsenal. At about 2:00 p.m. today, the pressure in the thunder box in the factory was too strong, and it suddenly exploded. At that time, three people, including the deceased, were injured. The other two, Qian Quangen and Shen Yuechu, were slightly injured and went to the hospital on their own. The deceased died immediately due to injuries to vital organs. The family members did not want to report the death and took care of the burial themselves.

<p>Songhu Road in this city was originally divided into two sections, north and south. The south section starts from Ningguo Road and ends at Kongjiang Road, and the north section starts from Xiangyin Road and ends at Jiangwan Stadium. The two sections are not connected, making transportation very inconvenient. It is now learned that the Municipal Public Works Bureau is scheduled to send workers today to start construction from Xiangyin Road in both directions to connect the road. The width of the road is set at 30 meters, and the 10-meter wide road surface will be built first. Also, the Municipal Public Works Bureau originally had a plan to build a road called Xiangzha Road from Diswei Road to the intersection of Songhu Road and Xiangyin Road.

<p>The electric company installs signs. The Shanghai Chinese Electric Company and the Pudong Electric Company have laid a submarine cable in the Huangpu River from about 280 meters southwest of the Shanghai Arsenal to the northwest end of the China Wharf, and from the riverside wharf east of the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai to the northwest end of the Pudong Coal Industry Public Stack, respectively. The project has been completed and submitted to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, which issued a notice together with the Public Security and Port Affairs Bureaus prohibiting ships from anchoring at the river crossing of the underwater cable to prevent damage. The company also followed the instructions of the Public Utilities Bureau to plan and install clear signs in Chinese with the eight characters (Electric Cable Crossing Prohibited Anchoring), each character being two English feet long and wide, and in English with the two words (Cable Crossing), each letter being eight inches wide and two English feet long. It also entrusted the Dongfang Nianhong Company to manufacture two Nianhong (Neon) lamps, one to be set up at the underwater cable on the southwest side of the Shanghai Arsenal and the other at the northwest end of the Pudong Coal Industry Public Stack, to emit light day and night, and the installation will be completed within the day. In addition, two white-painted T-shaped wooden boards were made, with the Chinese and English warning words painted on them in red paint. One was installed at the riverside wharf in Shanghai and the other at the underwater cable at the northwest end of the China Wharf in Pudong, and electric lights were installed around them to be powered on at night. Both signs are erected on ocean pine poles and planted in the river near the dredging line so that ships can pay more attention to them. In addition, boats are hired to patrol the river day and night, and warning signs are also installed on the boats. If a ship is found to be stopped and anchored, it will be stopped. In addition, notices are printed and staff are sent to distribute them to the ships in the river every other day and mailed to the import and export ship schedules published in the newspapers to urge them to pay attention. The maintenance of the cable is so thorough that no damage should occur.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Sudden Drop in Posted Exchange Rate <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The posted exchange rates in this city have been gradually decreasing in recent days. A week ago, one yuan could be exchanged for ten jiao plus 380 or 390 wen, equivalent to more than eleven jiao and four fen. Copper coins could be exchanged for 2,820 or 2,830 wen. However, the exchange rate has suddenly decreased for no reason. Yesterday, the posted exchange rate on the market was only ten jiao plus 260 or 245 wen, equivalent to eleven jiao, and copper coins were only 2,700 wen, which aroused public attention. The main reason for the increase in silver dollars and the sharp decrease in copper coins is purely because there were more exports last month, resulting in insufficient turnover of circulating funds in the market.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang Boatmen Are Very</p>
<p>Violently Pushing Passengers Into the Water</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangshun Steamer was arriving at Zhenjiang around 2:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 1st). Because the river was shallow, passengers had to hire boatmen to board the ship. A female passenger, Ms. Sun Jiang, was traveling to Shanghai with her sister and a nine-month-old child. They hired Wang Xiaokuai from Huaicheng and Liang San from Shanyang to row them to the ship, agreeing on a fare of 300 cash. As soon as they reached the ship, the boatmen, seeing that they could take advantage of the women and children, arbitrarily demanded more money. Ms. Sun Jiang, etc., refused to pay because they had agreed on the price beforehand. The boatmen, unable to extort the money, pushed the female passenger and the nine-month-old child into the river, nearly drowning them. Fortunately, the ship's sailors and tea room staff rescued them, preventing a tragic death. The boatmen then kidnapped three tea room staff members and imprisoned them in the Fozhao Lou Hotel in Zhenjiang. The ship's military police, seeing the mob's aggressive demeanor, used armed force to suppress them and rescue the kidnapped tea room staff. Upon arriving in Shanghai, the perpetrators and the instigator were handed over to the Water Police Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Lu Yunxi's Wife Files for Divorce <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Debate Concluded; Awaiting Judgment Lu Yunxi, a native of Songjiang who previously ran the two tabloids ("Ah Yao Wo Xin") and ("Crazy Wind"), was recently sued in the civil court by his wife, Lu Jicheng Ying, through a lawyer. The lawsuit alleged that Lu engaged in prostitution and gambling, was addicted to opium, and neglected the plaintiff, making cohabitation unbearable. The court ordered both parties to attempt reconciliation. Yesterday, a continued hearing was held. The defendant's lawyer stated that the plaintiff had never come to reconcile after the court order, and that the defendant opposed the divorce and requested the court to order the plaintiff to retrieve all her clothing and belongings and resume cohabitation. At this point, the plaintiff, Ji Cheng Ying, asked the court to observe that the defendant, Lu Yunxi, looked entirely like a "split-bill" type who had swindled women out of over a thousand yuan, which he had not returned a single cent. Furthermore, the defendant had published the woman's photograph in the newspaper with malicious words, deliberately insulting her. Given the complete breakdown of the marital relationship, cohabitation was impossible, and there was no hope of reconciliation. She requested a ruling and submitted the two newspapers in question for examination. Lu Yunxi claimed that the news was published by newspaper reporters and had nothing to do with him. Ji Cheng Ying responded that even if the news was published by reporters, the photograph belonged to the defendant, so why was it published in the newspaper? Was this not a deliberate attempt to damage her reputation? Judge Gong, the presiding judge, declared the debate concluded and the case would be heard for judgment.</p>

It is said that this matter will now be resolved through legal means.</p>

She was to bury the money in the dirt under the pole without fail. Cao Shi immediately reported this to the police station, who dispatched detectives to guard the location as scheduled. At 11:00 PM, a Chongming man named Bian Laohu came to dig in the dirt under the telephone pole. The detectives, seeing this clearly, immediately arrested him. Subsequently, a Ningbo man named Wang Chaochang was also captured. Yesterday morning, both were escorted to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Ge conducted a preliminary hearing. Because the police station requested a postponement for further investigation, Judge Ge approved the request and ordered the defendants to be detained and the hearing postponed.</p>

He has always been poor and recently, in August of this year, married a woman from his hometown named A Bao through a matchmaker. A Bao is only 15 years old. After the marriage, the couple was very loving. Jin was often on the boat, while A Bao worked in a factory. Recently, Chen Honghai, who lives at No. 16 next door, and his cohabiting woman, Chen Shi, noting that A Bao was beautiful, young, and weak, colluded to abduct her. On the 25th of last month, Chen Shi and Chen Honghai devised a plan to lure A Bao to the North Railway Station under the pretext of going to the theater. They entered a small hotel and rented a room. A Bao, seeing the situation, became suspicious and repeatedly tried to leave, but was forcibly prevented by the woman and sexually assaulted by Chen Honghai for three consecutive nights. During the day, a man named Zhang Shaolin came to the hotel to secretly discuss matters with Chen and the woman repeatedly. Later, they suddenly took A Bao to a certain brothel on Sixth Avenue. They sat there briefly for an hour on the evening of the 28th, and then Chen, Zhang, and A Bao went to a hotel on Fifth Avenue and rented a room. At this time, A Bao realized that she was being sold and pretended not to know. She took the opportunity to find out that Zhang had introduced her to the brothel for a price of 200 yuan, which was to be finalized the next day. A Bao was greatly alarmed and ran out to report the incident to the police on the 29th. They arrested Chen Honghai, Chen Shi, and Zhang Shaolin together and took them to the police station. After the head detective questioned them, he dispatched detectives to investigate. A Bao's husband, Jin Shoufu, was looking for her when he suddenly learned that she had been arrested and taken to the police station. Because the area was within the Chinese territory, Jin reported the incident to the Sixth District Branch Office, which was relayed to the Sixth District Police Department by Inspector Su. Director Ren of the district received the report and dispatched squad leader Liu Shaoqing and others from the detective team to the police station to bring back the four suspects together. After Director Ren questioned them, Jin Shoufu confessed that he was 22 years old, from Yancheng, and lived at No. 14, 30 Jian, and worked as a night-soil collector. Jin A Bao confessed that she was 15 years old, from the same place, and was abducted, sexually assaulted, and sold as described above. Chen Honghai confessed that he was 23 years old, from Ningbo, lived at No. 16, 30 Jian, and worked in a factory. He admitted to sexually assaulting and selling A Bao. Zhang Shaolin confessed that he was 21 years old, from Dachang, lived in Caoxiebang, and worked as a small worker. He claimed that Chen borrowed a robe from him for 3 yuan and 6 jiao to pay for the hotel, and falsely claimed that he knew nothing about the sale of A Bao. His other words were also very cunning. The woman, Chen Shi, confessed that she was 21 years old, from Changzhou, lived at No. 16, 30 Jian, and worked in the Fifth Cotton Mill. She admitted to abducting and selling A Bao and stated that her husband's name was Chen Hongfa. After hearing the confessions, Director Ren, believing that the case involved collusion to design the abduction of a newlywed woman, sexual assault, and intention to sell her as a prostitute, which was extremely illegal, dispatched detectives to summon Chen Hongfa to the case. Yesterday, a special document was prepared and sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e153">A Tianjin Friend Describes the Achievements of the Haijing Wool Weaving Industry <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>A Tianjin friend describes the rapid progress of the products of the Haijing Wool Weaving Factory. The following is a record: In the Chinese machine wool weaving industry, the Qinghe Ni Ge Factory was established in Beijing 20 years ago. However, due to business failure, no one has continued to operate it for a long time. At present, only the wool weaving factory operated by the American Haijing Foreign Firm in Tianjin can be called a rare survivor. Originally, the Haijing Foreign Firm specialized in managing wool weaving machines. Six years ago, due to the smooth export of Chinese carpets to the United States, it established its own factory on Hai Da Road. The firm purchased wool, spun it itself, dyed it, and still used hand-weaving. The scale of the operation is large and is the leading carpet factory in the country. The machine for spinning warp yarn was specially ordered from the United States and is large, not even found in the United States. Since Chinese carpets have had this warp yarn winding machine, the products have improved compared to before, and sales have been maintained. This year, the price of gold has soared, and the value of imported wool textiles has increased, while domestic demand is increasing day by day. The owner of Haijing, in view of this, established a machine weaving factory in Xikai two years ago. Machine-made bed blankets and carriage blankets are already being sold to the United States, bringing glory to Chinese industry. This year, the factory has further advanced to weaving clothing wool, and its products are as pure and strong as imported goods, but the value is half the price. Although the factory uses foreign guests, all raw materials and labor are Chinese. The specialized talents are also Chinese experts who have studied abroad, so its products should be regarded as domestic goods. This time, the Beijing-Liaoning through train needed new bed blankets because the old ones were worn out. It ordered 500 bed blankets from the foreign firm because the firm's products were excellent and the prices were cheap. Now, the bed blankets of the first-class sleeper cars of the Beijing-Liaoning through train have been replaced with new ones.</p>

<p>Invited to Eat and Talk</p>
<p>Scared to Death by Opium and Drawings</p>
<p>Wang Xinrong, 33 years old, from Haimen, works as a rice cook in the Sanyou Industrial Society factory in Yinxiang Port. He is scheduled to marry next month. It is said that his cousin, Wang Zhaoji, has no permanent occupation. Seeing that Wang Xinrong has been a rice cook in the Sanyou Industrial Society factory for many years and is now scheduled to marry, he must have savings. He intends to borrow 100 yuan from Xinrong. Xinrong told Zhaoji that he was short of money and that all the expenses for the wedding were borrowed from others. Zhaoji forcibly borrowed the money without success, so he invited Xinrong to "eat and talk." Xinrong, being honest, was terrified by the threats and swallowed raw opium and drawings yesterday morning. Fortunately, he was discovered and immediately sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>In the opium embezzlement case of the Nanshi Water Patrol Team, a group of people including Zhang Longfa, Ma Zhiyun, and Xing have not been apprehended. Now, Wu Qiaofu, also known as Wu Afu, is a major suspect in the case. One case has evolved into three or four cases, and it is not just an opium problem. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau and the local court have listed Wu as a wanted criminal. Yesterday, the court summoned Xu Jian to the case again. Because the previous bail of 10,000 yuan was insufficient, the court ordered an additional 20,000 yuan of written guarantee.</p>

<p>Around 3:00 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly and inadvertently broke out in the building above the Yuantai Sauce Shop, No. 66 Taiyangmiao Road, Zhabei, owned by Shen Bingyuan. The fire quickly spread through the roof, and the neighboring No. 68 was also affected. Fortunately, fire brigades from various sections rushed to the scene and bravely poured water for about a quarter of an hour before the fire was extinguished.</p>
<p>Li Zhenfa, a tenant of Zhao Fugen, and Zheng Yu of No. 68 were detained by the Fourth District Headquarters of the police. During the preliminary hearing by the director, both claimed that they did not know the cause of the fire. However, it was found that both houses were insured against fire, raising suspicions of arson for insurance compensation. They were immediately sent to the judicial section for review.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Jiangxi Representatives Arrive in Shanghai to Beg for Relief <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>A Heartbreaking Letter About the Jiangxi Disaster</p>
<p>Yesterday, two representatives from Jiangxi, Lu Fang and Wang Mingxuan, personally arrived at the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association to beg for relief. The Chinese and Western general secretaries met with them and stated that 24 counties in Jiangxi Province had suffered from natural disasters, and 60 counties had suffered from wind, insect, water, drought, and banditry. The disaster area was extremely wide, and the disaster situation was beyond description. Not only was there no harvest, but there was no home to return to. The weather was already cold, and there were no clothes to wear. Living in deep water and scorching fire, they did not hesitate to travel far to ask for sufficient relief so that millions of lives would not be left to fill gullies and ditches. They also presented a letter from Chairman Wang of the Provincial Relief Association, Yin Xiyuan, which was truly heartbreaking. It is copied as follows: "Jiangxi Province has unfortunately suffered repeated disasters. Last year, famine struck, and wind and insects ravaged the area. In addition, banditry has turned villages into ruins, fields into desolate places, and the countryside into thorny bushes. Corpses are piled in ditches, hurting the hearts of the old and weak. Looking to the end of the road, it is unbearable to witness the wandering children. The orphans are helpless, and the starving are pitiful. Hoping for relief and rehabilitation to usher in a paradise, official documents have been exchanged to aid those disaster victims. Although the heart is willing, the strength is lacking. A drop in the bucket can gather into a river, and united will can become a city. Hoping that the soil will become a mountain, who would have thought that the startled panting had not ceased and the red flames flared up again? Southern Jiangxi, such as Ganxian, Ji'an, Xingguo, Huichang, Ninggang, Yongxin, and Ruijin. Eastern Jiangxi, such as Yiyang, Guangfeng, Yushan, and Guixi. Western Jiangxi, such as Pingxiang, Yichun, Fenyi, and Wan載. Northern Jiangxi, such as Xiushui, Fuliang, Leping, and Lin陽, dozens of counties have suffered such tragic disasters that it is unbearable to speak of. Killing, arson, and looting. The strong are scattered, and the weak remain. The rich are impoverished, and the poor die. Groaning and awaiting death, they are all innocent people. Piled up in heaps, they are all green phosphorescent bones. The weeping boats and women drift, where can they rely? The elderly are sadly desperate at the door. Where can they hide from the continuous beacon fires? Surrounded by the sound of horns, the world is full of man-eating wolves and tigers. Who has no parents? Who has no wife and children? Seeing this cruelty, how can we not be saddened? Moreover, the frost and snow are coming soon. We must plan ahead, how can we allow this to be delayed?" It is heard that the association has exhausted all its resources in raising funds for the Northwest disasters in recent years and is currently lacking special funds for Jiangxi relief. In view of this situation, they are extremely anxious and eagerly hope that all sectors, if they have compassion for the people of Jiangxi, will quickly and generously donate to be sent to the disaster area to save them from their imminent crisis.</p>
<h3 id="e160">The Radical Advancement of the Zhejiang-Shanghai Coastal Shipping Industry <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The number of ships in the province and their categories: Zhejiang, due to its environmental conditions, is not affected by military affairs, so its construction is the best in the country. Zhejiang's coastal affairs have been handled with particular success. The latest news from the Zhejiang-Shanghai shipping industry is recorded in general terms as follows:</p>
<p>Shenjiamen Opens a New Route Shenjiamen is an important port area on the east coast of Zhejiang. In recent years, the number of marine products transported to Shanghai and other places has been increasing day by day. For the needs of the business community in the port, the Sanbei Company, controlled by Yu Qiaqing, built a new-style oil engine commercial ship with a deadweight of 1,000 tons in Shanghai at a cost of 140,000 taels for the use of the Shenjiamen route. This ship has been launched and is currently being equipped with passenger seats and will be able to start its scheduled service in early next month. The Sanbei Company has scheduled a daily service along the route, including Wanzhou and Zhoushan. It is heard that the transportation authorities have decided to establish a telegraph office in Shenjiamen for the convenience of shipping companies.</p>

The area designated by the provincial authorities is from Changtu Port in Dinghai to Shenjiamen. A fishing and experimental site has also been established. Sanmen Bay has also been designated as a fishing port. It is forbidden for Japanese fishing boats to enter the designated area. The Navy Department has been consulted to send a warship from December 1st to protect fishing boats and suppress pirates.</p>
<p>Construction of Twenty Public Ports The Zhejiang Shipping Administration Bureau, in order to develop coastal and inland river shipping, has not only chartered China Merchants' civilian ships and added money to the upper reaches of the Qianjiang River, but is now building twenty public wharf docks for steamships in various ports such as Kanmen, Zhenhai, Zhoushan, Shenjiamen, and Wuxing in eastern Zhejiang. Technician Chen and twenty surveyors have been sent to measure and map the locations before construction.</p>
<p>The Daily Prosperity of the Shanghai Route The Shanghai-Ningbo route has been jointly operated by four companies this year, with an agreed annual amount of 800,000 yuan, which is shared by the four companies, with Ningshao receiving the largest amount and Taikoo receiving the smallest. As for the Shanghai route, the number of passengers coming and going is increasing day by day, and this year is even better than last year. Ningshao has always been in the first place. This year, the Sanbei Company will renovate the Ningxing route, and the number of passengers taking it is increasing day by day. It is driving alongside Ningshao. It is found that in the eleven months from January to the present, the total number of passenger tickets received by the ship is 260,000 yuan, plus 470,000 jiao in small money. China Merchants has fewer passengers than the other four companies. However, according to statistics, the annual revenue of the four companies from passenger tickets is at least 1,100,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Shipment to Shanghai Begins Today Henan Tobacco Leaves, a Major Production Commodity, After the Retreat of Feng's Army, Tobacco Merchants in this Port Began to Carry Money to Henan to Collect and Transport the Goods to Shanghai for Resale to Various Places in Southeast Asia. However, the First Batch of Tobacco Leaves Out of the Province, Valued at Over One Million Yuan, was Detained During Loading. Shanghai Merchants Repeatedly Appealed, and Yesterday They Finally Received News of its Release. The Truth of the Detention: It Was Found that the Total Number of Tobacco Leaves Purchased from Xuchang, Henan by Shanghai Tobacco Merchants Reached 30,000 Pieces, Valued at 1.1 Million Yuan. In Mid-last Month, After the End of the Military Affairs in Central Henan, the Goods were Ordered to be Transported. They Were Transferred from the Pinghan Road to Hankou, and then by Yangtze River Ship to Shanghai. However, When the Huge Amount of Tobacco Leaves was Shipped from Xuchang, Taxes Were Paid as Usual, and When the Goods Arrived in Hankou, Xu Shaosong, a Member of the Two Lake Tobacco Tax Bureau, Reported to the Hankou Customs that the Taxes Paid When They Were Shipped from Xuchang Were Collected by Tax Officials Dispatched by Feng Yuxiang, and the National Army Found it Difficult to Acknowledge This. The Goods Were Immediately Detained and Not Allowed to be Transferred. All 30,000 Pieces of Tobacco Leaves Were Detained.</p>
<p>Merchants' Appeals When Shanghai Tobacco Merchants Received the News, They Reported that the Value of the Goods was Very Large, and Once They Were Blocked, the Losses Would be Huge. They Immediately Reported to the Tobacco Association and Sent a Telegram to the Hankou and Wuhan Authorities, Stating that Merchants Paid Taxes in Accordance with Regulations and There Was Nothing Inappropriate, and They Could Not Affect the Merchants Because of Political Relations. Moreover, the Principal Was at Stake and it was Difficult to Block for a Long Time. On One Hand, They Sent Personnel to Hankou to Ask the Provincial Government to Release the Goods, and on the Other Hand, They Asked Yu Zhiqin and Others in Shanghai to Send a Telegram to Chairman He Xuezhu of the Hubei Province to Order the Garrison Command to Release the Huge Amount of Tobacco Leaves Detained from Henan Province. Telegrams Were Sent in Succession for Half a Month, and It Was Not Until Yesterday that There Were Results.</p>

As They Were in Compliance, He Had Forwarded the Relevant Documents of this Case to the Wuhan Garrison Command, Asking it to Approve the Release of the Large Amount of Henan Tobacco Leaves Detained by the Next Day. The Detained Tobacco Leaves Can be Shipped to Shanghai, Which is a Major Transportation Business for the Shipping Industry. Various Chinese and Foreign Commercial Ships in this Port are Competing for Loading, as the Freight Alone Costs Tens of Thousands of Dollars. British and Japanese Shipping Companies are Even More Eager to Load. It Was Heard Yesterday that the Tobacco Merchants in this Port Have Decided that the Goods Will be Transported by Chinese Ships and Have Contacted the Sanbei Company to Arrange for the Bureau to Send Ships to Load the Goods to Shanghai and Distribute a Part to the China Merchants Bureau for Loading. The Shipment Will Begin Today, and the Detention Storm Has Been Resolved Peacefully.</p>

<p>Rice and Grain Industry: Fan Hesheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Rice and Grain Trade Association, sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting it to forward a letter to the Banking Association, stating: "Respectfully, regarding the case of Maoye Bank banknotes, although the one-yuan notes have been cashed, there has been no news of cashing for the five-yuan and ten-yuan notes. Our colleagues have a considerable number of these notes, which are vital to their capital and difficult to turn around. The end of the lunar year is approaching, and the impact on finance is by no means insignificant. Many banks in Shanghai issue banknotes, and the Banking Association should bear the responsibility of safeguarding credit. If it does not supervise and recover the Maoye banknotes, the commercial sector will suffer a profound impact. To avoid harm, it is inevitable that everyone will tend towards cash transactions. Once this prediction unfortunately materializes, the impact of hindering finance will make the entire commercial sector feel uneasy. Judging from the news that dozens of banks in the United States have recently collapsed, this unfortunate news is indeed alarming to the world of commerce. For the sake of commercial security, we are specially requesting your esteemed association to forward our request to the Shanghai Banking Association to find ways to urge the Maoye Bank Liquidation Office to redeem the five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes to maintain credit and ensure commercial stability. Sincerely, the public enterprise." Addressed to: Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>To the Editor: In your newspaper's local news on the 30th of last month, there was a report about the Jiangda ship being damaged in Xun, which is inconsistent with the facts. According to our bureau's investigation, the Jiangda ship departed from Shanghai on the 21st of the previous month and arrived in Xun on the morning of the 25th to dock and unload cargo. No accidents occurred. On the same day, it safely arrived in Hankou at midnight. This week, when sailing downstream 12 kilometers above Jiujiang, due to the rudder malfunction, it could not avoid colliding with the shore. Only one or two iron nails in the anchor chain cabin were loosened, causing minor leakage. However, there was absolutely no water entering the cargo hold. This concerns the reputation of the bureau's ship. We hope that you will disclose this letter in the local news column and offer our best wishes. Addressed to: Shenbao News Agency. Sincerely, Secretariat of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company General Administration, December 2nd.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Humble Suggestions on Promoting Pure Silk National Goods for Lake Products for Clothing Materials by Zhu Tanru <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Since the world's commercial war, our country has been invaded by foreign goods. Patriotic people have been advocating national goods as a solution. However, many people talk about it, but few act on it. One reason is that they admire the beauty of foreign goods, and the other is that there are no national goods to replace them. Take the mandarin jacket as an example. Anyone in society who has even slight social interaction has one. Now, fancy silk satins have become a thing of the past, and wool and serge are extremely fashionable. If we calculate one-four-hundredth of our country's 400 million people, approximately one million people wear mandarin jackets. Each jacket costs ten yuan, totaling ten million yuan exported in one year. Other men's and women's long and short clothes are many times more than this. It is truly sad to say. Now, pure silk mandarin jacket material from Lake products has been invented, which is commonly known as crepe de chine. It is dyed black, has a luster without floating light, and has no creases even when pressed. If satin is used as the lining, it feels even more elegant. It is cheaper and better than wool serge. Ordinary stores do not yet have this product. It is said that the largest silk stores in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Huzhou already sell this crepe. You can try it and know that this statement is credible. I serve in the Lake City and care about the silk industry. Based on my conscience, I offer this bitter advice. Rather than empty talk about promoting national goods, why not actually try and use them? I hope that all patriotic gentlemen in the country will pay attention to it. It would be fortunate if they do not disregard it because of my insignificant position and words. Zhu Tanru, Wuxing Unified Donation Collection Bureau, November 29th.</p>

<p>— Yimei</p>
<p>In a degenerate age, seeking morality is harder than finding a spring in the desert.</p>
<p>Vulgar soil prefers to write articles, and ugly women prefer to apply powder.</p>
<p>Feelings must be close to infatuation to be genuine, and talent must be close to interest to be transformative. This is what a wise man said, and I deeply admire it.</p>
<p>Going to the field of love is like going to the battlefield. You must be brave and energetic to win.</p>
<p>People like to dance and drink wine, but I like to brew tea in the bamboo forest.</p>
<p>Adorning a beautiful flower on a beauty's head is not considered a waste.</p>
<p>The presence of clouds in the sky is like a bathing woman wearing thin silk, covering her mystery.</p>
<p>In turbulent times, theorists take those who keep silent as their role models.</p>
<p>Men of letters do not like to show their original drafts, just as women are unwilling to show their faces without makeup.</p>
<p>Only extraordinary people can create works that lament the world and pity people in a world of bright lights and wine.</p>
<p>Those who are disappointed in love are most afraid of listening to love songs.</p>
<p>Talented women rarely have beautiful and charming appearances.</p>
<p>When chatting with those who do not share the same values, one often racks one's brains and finds no topics to talk about.</p>
<p>Lying in a warm quilt and listening to the howling wind outside, one often has the idea of building a big house to shelter scholars.</p>
<p>Paying off debts is more comfortable than bathing in Tangshan.</p>
<p>Looking at the sword in the middle of the night is the behavior of a knight-errant; endlessly chanting poetry is the true nature of a poet.</p>
<p>Seeing the fields and villages from the Suzhou-Shanghai train, I want to take off my dusty clothes and change into a summer shirt.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Mei Lanfang's Visit to Deputy Commander Zhang in Nanjing <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Yijun</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang and his entourage arrived in Shanghai on the 24th of this month by the first train from Tianjin to Nanjing, as reported in various newspapers. The day before he left from Beiping, he received a telegram from a friend in Nanjing saying that Deputy Commander Zhang wanted to meet Mei when he passed through Nanjing. Mei immediately telegraphed back that it was possible. When the train arrived in Pu on the morning of the 26th, more than a dozen of Mei's friends, including Shu Shifu, who is currently serving as a military advisor in the National Government, greeted him at the station. Mei immediately boarded a special ferry with his secretary Li Feishu, Da Wutai manager Huang Quansheng, and the welcoming guests. The others who came with him went directly to Shanghai by car. After Mei and others arrived in Nanjing, they first went to Shu's residence for a short rest. The mayor of Nanjing, Wei Daoming, had already received the news of Mei's arrival in Nanjing and immediately held a banquet at his private residence to welcome Mei. Mei then went to the banquet, and those present included Li Shizeng and Peng Huaiyu. Director Peng came with Deputy Commander Zhang this time. Mei then asked him when the Deputy Commander would be available. Peng telegraphed the headquarters and was told that Mei was invited to go at 2 PM. It was already past 1 PM. After a hurried banquet, he went directly to the Deputy Commander's headquarters with Li Feishu, accompanied by Tian Shijie and Shu Shifu, two military advisors from the National Government. Inside and outside the headquarters, sentries were posted everywhere, and the security was extremely strict. Mei's car should have driven directly inside, and the soldiers all raised their guns to salute. After the aide submitted the visiting card, the Deputy Commander came out to see him in a few minutes, stepped forward to shake hands with Mei, and said to Mei, "I haven't seen you for a long time. This trip to the United States was very hard. I read the newspaper and knew that you were praised by the people there, which is a glory for the country." Mei was humble and unassuming. Mei then introduced the people who came with him, and they took their seats. Zhang said, "The other day, my wife came and said that she met you in Tianjin. I also wanted to know the details of your visit to the United States and wanted to see you." Mei then presented a detailed account of his experience in the United States. Zhang was encouraging and urged Mei to work hard. He also asked Mei how many days he would be in Shanghai. Mei replied that it would be about a month and a half. After that, he might come to Nanjing again. Mei also asked the Deputy Commander when he would return to the north and whether he would go to Beiping. Zhang said that he might be able to go to Beiping in four or five days, but it was not yet decided whether to go to Beiping or return directly to Liaoning. By the time he finished speaking, it was already almost 4 PM. Zhang had to attend a transportation conference, so Mei and others said goodbye and went with Shu and Li to visit Ming Mausoleum and pay their respects to Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum. The mausoleum gate was already closed. Mei stood at the gate and bowed three times to show his respect. He then returned to Shu's residence to rest. At 7 PM, he went to the banquet at Mayor Wei's house. Li Shizeng's banquet also discussed in detail the improvement of drama and the fundraising for the Chinese Conservatory of Music. Zhang was supposed to attend the banquet, but he was afraid that he would not be able to come until after 10 PM because he was attending Jiang Jieshi's banquet. Mei had to take the 11 PM train to Shanghai, so he did not wait long and said goodbye to the host and went to the Xiaguan station. When the train passed through Zhongshan Avenue, Mei greatly admired the perfection and neatness of the road, saying that it was very similar to the rural roads in the United States. After arriving at the station, he immediately boarded the train. The train car was reserved by Mr. Li Shizeng, who specially gave it to Mei. The train left at 11 PM and arrived in Shanghai at 7 AM the next morning, going directly to the Fanwang Temple to stay. When the reporter visited Mei yesterday, Mei was out on business. I met Mr. Li Feishu, whom I had met before. He was writing a letter to a friend in Beiping, reporting his visit to Zhang in Nanjing, and showed it to me. I silently remembered his words and wrote this.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Jiaotong University and Guanghua University Mandarin Debate Record of Interest <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Zhizheng</p>
<p>After the Four Universities English Speech Contest was completed, there was also a Mandarin debate. The debaters used the same topic to divide into positive and negative sides, each refuting the other with reasons. Therefore, it was more interesting than a speech. On the afternoon of the 26th, Jiaotong University and Guanghua University held a preliminary competition. The venue was the Wenzhi Hall of Jiaotong University. Before 3 PM, it was already crowded with people. Now I will choose to record some trivia to fill this talk.</p>
<p>One Chinese and One Western: The meeting started at 4 PM. The president of Jiaotong University, Li Zhaohuan, presided over the meeting. The debaters occupied both sides of the rostrum. Each school had three representatives. The Guanghua representatives were all wearing Chinese-style robes, while Jiaotong University was all wearing black suits. One Chinese and one Western complemented each other, which was also a fun thing.</p>
<p>Sharp Words: The six representatives took turns to state their reasons in order. The topic of the debate that day was (Shanghai universities should be merged into a large-scale university) (Jiaotong University advocated the positive side, and Guanghua University advocated the negative side. Both sides had very sufficient reasons. The general idea of the positive side was that the times needed it, and it saved expenses. The negative side argued that each school had its own special relationship, and their natures were different. How could they be mixed together?) The words were sharp, and the listeners felt unparalleled interest and forgot their fatigue.</p>
<p>Wonderful Refutation: After the six representatives finished their speeches, they rested for five minutes and then began the refutation. The refuters collected the other side's reasons and refuted them item by item. It was very difficult because it was out of the blue and only lasted five minutes. Liu Xuantian from Jiaotong University refuted each point of Guanghua based on his talent, making the other side completely devastated. The wonderful performance caused cheers to thunder. For example, Guanghua said that universities should not be limited to national and established ones. Private schools should also be included. However, Jiaotong University said that those that have not been established have lost their legal qualifications, so they cannot be considered universities, and so on. The back-and-forth of the words was very audible.</p>
<p>The Chairman Encouraged Female Students to Join: After the refutation, the judges Zhu Shaoping, Gui Zhongshu, Chen Heqin, etc., calculated the scores. The chairman took the opportunity to report on the history and benefits of the debate and said that female students had joined the English speech, but there was no Mandarin debate, which was a pity. He hoped that it would not be the case next year so that the listeners would feel more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Amazing Charts: For the sake of fully increasing its strength, Jiaotong University specially drew many charts, such as student comparison charts for each university, economic status competition charts, etc., all more than a dozen colorful and exquisitely drawn. It was indeed the magic weapon for winning this time. It can be said that a lot of effort was put into it.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University's Double Happiness: Before long, the chairman announced the results. The first place individual was Liu Xuantian from Jiaotong University, who won a silver medal. The first place group belonged to the positive side, so it was also won by Jiaotong University. It can be said that double happiness came to the door. For a time, cheers shook the house. It was indeed a grand event.</p>
<p>Ming's Linguistic Repentance: In addition to Liu, the Jiaotong University representative also included China's delegation leader to the Far Eastern Games, the discus king Ming Jun. Because Jun was unable to fully prepare due to work, the result was ranked sixth (sixth place) and Yiming. The linguistic repentance also happened to be a coincidence, so it was attached to it.</p>
<h3 id="e173">The Rural Carnival at Shanghai University: A Postscript <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Du Zhaoshu</p>
<p>On the sixty-fifth anniversary of the birth of the late Mr. Sun Yat-sen, our school celebrated with a special Rural Carnival. On this day, the sky was clear, and the traffic on the banks of the Huangpu River was extremely heavy. Zhaoshu personally attended the grand event and was happy. Therefore, I recorded its brief outline as follows:</p>
<p>The Grand Occasion of the Venue: The center of the conference was in Yates Hall. The slogans were fresh and full of beautiful things, reflecting the yellow and purple chrysanthemums listed on all sides, especially for the education, health, agriculture, industry and commerce exhibitions listed on the upper floors, mainly to open up the knowledge of the rural people. The most exciting of its various pastimes are Tan Xiaolin's erhu, Wu Tiesheng's unicycle show, the national music society's music, and the science museum's movies, all of which can make rural people dance and be happy.</p>
<p>The Attention-Grabbing of the Female Dormitory: The Japanese school girls' dormitory is open, and the furnishings are more simple, such as a certain room with a white wall lining a white bed, or a certain piece of goods with a uniform goose yellow, all of which can attract people's attention. Some university students who visited sighed and said, "It's amazing!" It is so moving to the eye.</p>
<p>The Fun of Arguing Over the Ding: In the middle school student achievement exhibition, there were paper and wax fruits. The villagers thought it was real and applauded, saying that the students were affectionate and gave us fruits. After looking at it for a long time, they smiled and stopped. When Principal's wife Ms. Wang distributed hundreds of bags of candy to the children of the villagers, the elders also competed for it. When the Sanyou Industrial Company gave national goods towels, the villagers' new clothes and hats were sacrificed a lot because they were too crowded and their hats fell off and their clothes were torn. In particular, arguing over the ding was interesting and showed the ingenuity of the operation, which added to the glory of the conference.</p>
<p>The Wonderful Football Match: In the morning, the university football team of our school competed with Guanghua. Hu Minteng performed the best in our school. The rest, such as Huang Jiaoyan and Zhao Xitian, also had considerable performances. The inside guards of Guanghua were all good, and the rest were also competent. It is a pity that I cannot mention their names. In the afternoon, the middle school of our school competed with St. John's Middle School. Among them, Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang were the best. They were wearing white clothes and white pants and had smiling faces. Although they had wins and losses, they did not care at all. Their spirit of friendship was admirable. Finally, the basketball game between Huadong and the middle school of our school was also wonderful.</p>
<p>The Busy Support of the Head of Our Regiment: On this day, the order in the school was maintained by our Boy Scouts. The head of the regiment, Ni Jiaxi, also served as the reception director. He had to inspect our negligence from time to time, and he had to go back and forth to entertain the guests and guide the villagers to visit. His busy support was like this.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the fifth day, the Daoist came and said that he had a dream that night. Guanyin spoke to him and showed him the red kasaya he was wearing, saying, "This is made of human flesh." The inner layer of blue kasaya said, "This is made of animal flesh." Another layer of kasaya said, "This is made of the flesh of different kinds of beings." After saying that, he said, "I am going to see God to discuss the method of saving the world." Then he held the incense burner and flew into the air. I responded indifferently. In the afternoon, Master Wan came and said that Professor Liu Tianxi of Yangon University had invited him to tea. So, we went together and visited his school outside the big lake. Students were practicing swimming. There were Eastern and Western Document Rooms in the school. Master Dao entered the Western Document Room and saw colored Dunhuang Stone Chamber Buddhist scriptures and Buddha statues printed in London. When he opened it for the first time, he saw a Tang Dynasty painting of Guanyin in red. Master Dao said, "This is exactly the same as what I dreamed of at night." He also saw a blue-clothed Guanyin statue, which was also the same as the dream. It is said that dreams often foretell the future, which is the so-called way to communicate day and night.</p>
<p>On the evening of the sixth day, a sermon was held in Myanmar to save the world from Eastern culture, which was very welcome. The meeting was hosted by Indians. The leader was a female teacher, Dri Beansang, also known as Bisheng. It is said that there are 15 million people worldwide, and Shanghai also has its location, one at the east end of Damalu and one at the intersection of Kade Road on Jing'an Temple Road. A girls' school is run there. I often go there. In the past, Mr. Wu Tingfang joined its meeting. Master Wan said that it was founded by a Russian woman dozens of years ago. Russia wanted to plot against Tibet and sent people to learn Tibetan Buddhism. There are secret magic powers. The Russian woman did not return to Russia but preached in India. The female leader has died, and there are two male and female disciples. The man is named Dharmapala, and the woman is Bisheng. The woman has magic powers, but the man does not, but both can manage property, so they are quite attached to by the general public. The church is scattered everywhere and is prosperous in India. If it is in India, it will not dare to slander it. If it is slandered, it will be dominated by its power. According to the purpose it has announced, it is for the world peace movement, but according to Master Wan, its doctrine is also lofty, and it is also extremely advocating for the freedom of men and women. However, it does not advocate fertility. Indians often have secret skills. According to its members, Bisheng is nearly sixty years old and is now going to England to show me her image, which is now called the Mother of the World. When I come to India, I will definitely visit its meeting.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Cui Xiu Earnestly Asks for Guidance from the Teacher, Generous Talk of Military Affairs and a Feast for Heroines in a Brothel</p>
<p>Thereupon, the few people swayed and swaggered to the Xinghua Restaurant. Fortunately, although snowflakes were dancing, they were not very heavy. As they walked through the glass doors of the Xinghua Restaurant, they immediately felt as if spring had filled the room and it was much warmer. As they stepped onto the escalator, a waiter behind the counter uttered a sound without discernible meaning, and no one knew what he was saying. Guessing from his intent, he was probably calling out to welcome the guests, alerting the waiters upstairs to pay attention. Two or three waiters were already waiting on the stairs, all wearing uniforms made of blue wool, with two red Roman numerals on their chests, which were their assigned numbers, and a pencil clipped to their ears. The waiters in the Cantonese restaurants seemed neater than those in other restaurants. They led them to a room facing west along the road, which was quite spacious. Ye Haoran wanted to change to another room, as he found this place too noisy and preferred somewhere quieter. However, the waiter said that there were no other rooms available, except for this one. It turned out that next door was a hall where a wealthy family was hosting a large banquet, calling for countless Cantonese prostitutes and a band of musicians. There were loud sounds of gongs, drums, and cymbals, creating a deafening noise. Whenever Cantonese people host a large banquet, known as "opening the hall," they always have Cantonese prostitutes and a band of musicians to make a lot of noise. Ye Haoran wanted to change the location because he found it too noisy, which was why. Ling Zhixiang said, "Let them make noise. We can make noise too. They can call Cantonese opera singers, and we can call local opera singers." Long Ziyun said, "No matter what, we can't outdo them in making noise. The opera singers we call can only sing Kunqu opera with the accompaniment of the erhu, pipa, and a flute. They have gongs and drums like the heavens are falling, and there's also something like the clapper in Northern Bangzi opera. I don't know what it is. In their symphony, there's a cymbal as big as a shield, and you can imagine how loud the sound is. One day, a Cantonese friend invited me to Hongkou to see Cantonese opera, saying that two famous Cantonese performers had just arrived from Hong Kong and were said to sing very well. That Cantonese friend knew the plot of the opera and could understand their lyrics, nodding and enjoying himself immensely. But I felt completely clueless. The strangest thing was that their stage also had a group of people playing gongs and drums, making music. In Peking opera, this is called the 'changmian.' The performers only sing, and the 'changmian' people never open their mouths. But in Cantonese opera, the 'changmian' people sing along with the actors. Sometimes, during chaotic dancing, the 'changmian' people hold up two large cymbals and dance wildly along with the actors. This is truly laughable to see." In the middle of their conversation, they heard a burst of zheng and clanging sounds from next door, which turned out to be the Cantonese prostitutes playing the dulcimer. Soon after, they heard a melodious singing voice. Long Ziyun said, "This is probably a 'qingshan' from the Cantonese opera."</p>

<p>Business News: Financial Gold Market Soars Straight Up</p>
<p>Soaring Seven Taels and One Mace</p>
<p>Future Prospects Remain Optimistic</p>
<p>Rapid Strides Forward, Peaks Repeatedly Appear. Yesterday, December 2nd, the price of gold repeatedly reached new peaks, once again exceeding the 600 tael mark, advancing swiftly as if about to reach the summit. However, the daily total turnover was only four taels, with minor fluctuations. Purchases and sales varied greatly among dealers, each acting according to their own intentions. The foreign exchange rate continued to decrease by half a cent, but the domestic market remained strong, with eager buyers. As for over-the-counter transactions, dealers such as Yuansheng, Yuanmao, and Yongyu were actively buying, while Lianbang and Fuchang, Taiheng Yuan, etc., were still actively selling. The overseas silver market experienced a sharp decline, with strong selling intentions from the United States. Therefore, even after a rapid surge, sellers did not relent, leading to a sudden downturn. The price dropped from over 603 taels to just over 600 taels. The future market is expected to be strong due to the favorable exchange rate, and the buying momentum from Taitai Chang, Wanxing Shunli, Yu Da, and others in the market is strong, leading to a remarkable surge in prices. A new peak of 604 taels and six mace was reached, with fluctuations of only one tael or so.

<p>Yesterday, the financial community's business was busy and moderate, but it could not be expanded. Because it is the end of the year and the government is strictly implementing the order to close accounts on the national calendar, it does not dare to engage in development, and the business situation is deserted. However, the receipt and settlement procedures are particularly busy. All kinds of market prices for auxiliary coins must have major changes at the end of the year due to annual habits. The Guangjiao and copper coins have been shrinking in order for days, and yesterday it became more and more serious, which has attracted the attention of society. Small businesses are particularly affected.</p>
<p>The Header Lining Is Wide and the Interest Rate Is Relaxed (Silver Cents) The Early Market Was Seven Money Two Fen Four Li Half, Slightly Better Than the Previous Day, a Hairy Two Hairs and a Half, but at Noon the Market Fell by Two Hairs and a Half Again and Was Seven Money Two Fen Four Li Two Hairs and a Half. As a Result, It Was Smaller Than the Previous Day, a Hair and Two Hairs and a Half. (Silver Discount) The Previous Day Seemed Tight and Stiff, but Yesterday It Loosened Again. The Early Market Was One Money Three Points, and at Noon It Even Entered the One Money Gate and Was Nine Points. The Loose Situation and the Abundance of the Header Lining Were No Less Than the Situation in the First Half of the Year. The Bank Lists Were Classified as Five Points with Heads and No Water, and the Rates Were Blank</p>
<p>Double Hairs Are Highly Raised, Affecting the Jiang Corner. The Jiangnan Small Foreign Currency Has No Purpose and There Is a Shortage of Market Goods. Therefore, the Price Has Never Changed Significantly. Especially This Time, Because of the Support of the Guangjiao, the Price Has Risen Sharply, Even Exceeding Five Cents. The Early Market Was Six Money Five Fen Two Li, and at Noon It Was Six Money Five Fen One Li. Trading in the Early Market Was Three Thousand Five Hundred Corners, and at Noon It Was Two Thousand Corners. Recently, There Has Been a Lot of Demand for Small Foreign Currencies in Guangdong and There Are No Goods to Meet the Market. So Each Other Madly Raises the Price. The Early Market Was Six Money Five Fen One Li, and at Noon It Was Six Money Five Fen One Li Half, Which Was Better Than the Previous Day by Three Li Half. Trading in the Early Market Was Forty Thousand Five Thousand Corners, and at Noon It Was Thirty-Five Thousand Corners. Copper Coins Also Shrank Sharply Five Thousand Five Hundred Texts for Three Hundred Seventy Six Thousand Texts</p>

<h3 id="e179">Trends in Securities and Bond Prices Circulate <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were zero bond spot transactions and the week market was as lively as before. It is estimated that the turnover in the morning reached more than 6.7 million, and there were also 4 million in the afternoon. The market price in the pre-market was weak, such as 19 customs, 19 good, disarmament, and demobilization, etc., all slightly tired. The post-market sales gradually decreased, and the bond price circulated and rose. However, because the supply and demand situation was still peaceful, although there were fluctuations and ups and downs, the trend was quite stable. The result was that the largest increase compared to the previous day was the Aftermath of the Nineteenth Year, with a good increase of one yuan, two angles and a half in December and an increase of up to one yuan, seven angles and a half in January. Also, 19 Customs, Whole Six, etc., also increased by six or seven angles or so, and other ups and downs were mutually seen and the number was only about one or two angles. It is estimated that the total daily spot transaction was 40,200 yuan and the futures were over 11 million yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e180">The Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Is Falling Rapidly <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Approaching the 140 Taels Mark. The Yarn Market Is Increasingly Trapped In Water and Fire. Due to the General Trend Lacking a Turning Point, It Has Been in the Sunset in Recent Months. The Oversize Bulls Have Been Unable To Maintain It. They Have Had to Bear the Pain To Close the Short Position, Then Throwing Stones Down the Well, Causing It to Continue to Fall, Directly Knocking on the One Hundred and Forty Taels Mark. Although This Situation Is Expected by the General Public, the Swiftness of It Is Not Expected. As for the Future of the Market, It Is Generally Agreed That It Is Not Easy to Improve, But Some Speculation May Require a Circulation.</p>
<p>People Drift in the River, Downward Day by Day. People's Bids From Beginning to End Are in Danger. First, Because the U.S. Cotton News Was Not Good and a Certain Manufacturer Sold a Large Number of Long Positions, Followed by the Stagnation of Actual Sales, the Three-Product Market Collapsed. The Front Market Fell by Three Coins to Eight Coins, and the Back Market Fell by Four Coins to Nine Coins. A Total of 27,450 Bales Were Transacted. The Closing Price Is Recorded on the Left</p>

<p>The Current Needs Year Are Equal to Zero. The Current Yarn and Customer Gangs Are Taking a Wait-and-See Attitude, and Transactions Are Almost Equal to Zero. It Is Verified That 380 Bales Were Removed From Each Gang Throughout the Day, and the Market Fell by About Seven Money. Five Customer Gangs, Inland Entered 175 Bales Miscellaneous Gang 200 More Bales Said</p>
<h3 id="e181">The Cotton Market Is Very Weak <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Cotton Continues to Decline... The Yarn Market Is Getting Worse Day by Day</p>
<p>Heavy Pressure... Perilous</p>
<p>After the Deterioration of the Cotton Market, the Overseas Situation Is Declining and Of Course It Can Only Proceed on a Pessimistic Track. This Is Why It Fell Again Yesterday. The Overall Situation of the Cotton Market Is Really Not a Cause of Danger Period That Is Not Over in Pieces. The Surface Is Particularly Unstable, So the Call for Thirty-Two Is Loud, But in Fact, There Is No Kind That Is Suitable for Submission to the Station.</p>
<p>Hanbiao Fell Again. Hanbiao Felt That Everywhere Was Not Good Due to the Unfavorable Environment and Fell, and They Sold off One After Another, But They Were Absorbed by a Part of Profitable Shorts, So There Was No Big Fall at First, But They Were Greatly Influenced by the Biao, and People's Hearts Were Very Empty. The Front Market Fell by Five Points to One Money Five, and the Back Market Continued to Fall by Five Points to Two Money. A Total of 51,900 Loads Were Transacted. The Closing Price Is Recorded Later</p>

<p>U.S. Cotton Continued to Fall by More Than Ten Pounds The Price of Yesterday's U.S. Cotton Fell at First Due to the Unfavorable Spot Market and Southern Hedging, and Then Slightly Rebounded Due to a Part of Short Accounts Offset. It Is Estimated That the Futures Fell 10 to 13 Pounds and the Spot Fell 15 Pounds. British Cotton Futures Fell 4 Points and Spot Fell 1 Point. Egyptian Cotton Spot Remained Still Indian Cotton Weakened Due to Speculators' Sales. It Is Estimated That Pinger's Near and Far Futures and Bai Luoxi Fell by One Ruby, Olumra Fell by Two Robbies and the Far Date Fell by One Robbies.

<p>Thin Geng Glutinous Rice Consistently Continues to Be Used</p>
<p>Top Geng Enters the 14 Yuan Gate</p>
<p>The Lamb Du Tip Market Is Also Soft</p>
<p>Zhabei Yesterday, a large number of rice boats arrived at the port from all routes, with as many as five or sixty boats, and more than 160 boats in the river, of which the fewest were Xian rice and the most were Northern Geng, so all parties were very uninterested in white Geng, and the producing areas were very prosperous in the late stages, and people's hearts were looking soft. The street sales were especially dull, and the market dropped sharply by four or five corners. Top Geng has entered the 14 Yuan gate, only opening 13 Yuan and 89 coins, and the situation is unusually weak. The thin rice also returned, and the buying interest was calm, reducing two or three corners. The special top goods barely opened 11 Yuan and 9 corners, and the customs cut a lot, and the lamb Xian was still standing at first, but then the price followed the general trend and softened due to the stagnation of sales. Du tip also followed for a small two corners, and the foreign market opened high at 12 Yuan and 5 corners, and the port tip customer tips all saw a drop of half a coin, and the market situation unanimously tended to weaken. Yuan Meng dropped half a Yuan, and the negative change was also small for four corners. The customer sales were lonely and the arrival of goods was surging, and the market was very weak, especially the top change in the market was very evident, with the price between 14 Yuan and 12 corners.</p>
<p>Hunan, Shanghai Yesterday, the number of goods arriving from the river continued to be about 30, and the market sales were strangely dull. The Changxi Northern Geng Fell Back by Three Angles or So. There Were Few Transactions, and the Top Opened at 13 Yuan and 78 corners. Su Tong's Each Geng Also Turned Down Sharply, with a total Drop of Three or Four Corners. The Buyers in the City and Country Were Waiting and Seeing, and the Market Was in a Step-by-Step State. The Early Rice of the Southern Gang and the Thin Rice Was Short, and the Top Thin Only Opened 11 Yuan and 56 corners, Most of Which Had to Be Smaller by Four Corners. The Zero Sales of Lamb Xian and Du Xian Were Not Bad, but the Prices Were Slightly Tired. Recently, There Were Very Few Changing Yuan Goods, Although There Were Still Some in Stock, However, the Goods Could Be Maintained by Customers Selling and Buying. Generally, the Small Two or Three Corners Top Opened at 14 Yuan and Three Angles, and the Negative Change Was Extremely Tired. The Drop Was Terrible, and the Market Opened High at About 12 Yuan.</p>

<p>Empty Factories and Sets... Come Together Yesterday, the Flour Market Situation Saw a Crazy Fall of One and a Half Points After the Market Opened in the Morning. Although There Was a Turning Point for Filling Vacancies, the Afternoon Was Once Again Cased by Factories, Causing the Small Far-Term Each Month to Also Be Held Down by Shorts and Casing. The Opening Was Good in the Morning, but It Was Especially Strange to See It Fall in the Afternoon, Which Was Actually Because the Foreign Wheat Quota Was Too Large and the Customer Transformation Was Delayed. The Foreign Market Price Was Reported Frequently, and Although There Was Little Current Powder Storage, the Factory Price Still Shouted More Than Two or Two Money, and the Actual Sales Did Not Move, Which Was Enough to Prevent Digestion, so the Futures Market Price and the Current Powder Price Were on the Same Track and Tended to Each Other. The Final Closing Twelve Months and January Each Small One Point Two, February Small One Point Half, March Small One Point Four, April Small One Point Two Five May Small Seven Li Half Said</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat market opened in the morning with reports of foreign wheat prices falling by two, three, and four jiao, leading to a sharp decline in prices for both near-term and distant months. The steady situation of the previous day was completely broken, and both hedgers shorting and bulls covering became increasingly prominent. As a result, prices for the current month and March/April each fell by two-tenths of a fen, while prices for May/June each fell by three-quarters of a fen. Spot wheat arrivals and sales were still low, and the market appeared even more sluggish and lifeless. The Tongshi firm, operated by Huafeng, imported over a thousand packages of Taizhou wheat, priced at 3.7 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Sugar Market, Sugar Prices Rise Even More Fiercely <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's production area telex reported that the spot price of Cuban sugar was 1.46875, a slight increase of 0.0625 compared to the previous telex. The price of New York futures sugar for December was 1.35, for March of next year was 1.475, and for May was 1.55, all with no change. The price for September was 1.67, a decrease of one fen. The spot price of Java sugar and the futures price for December remained at 7.875. The price for January of next year was 8.00, an increase of 0.125. The new price for February was 8.125. Although transactions by the association were few, the market sentiment was extremely strong, and the lack of available goods led to further price increases. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar opened at 7.7 taels and quickly rose to 7.75 taels. Fine granulated white sugar was at 7.85 taels, and No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was at 6.9 taels. The market situation was very firm. The Dutch red sugar market also followed suit, with No. 8 goods priced at 6.4 taels. The speed of the chaotic trend in the Japanese sugar market was truly rare. YRO mark was at 7.35 taels, YP mark was at 8.25 taels, TM mark was at 7.5 taels, N mark was at 8 taels, TK mark was at 7.9 taels, and J mark was as high as 8.4 taels, with very few available goods. The market sentiment was extremely strong, showing signs of further increases. Taikoo B mark, the buying agent's goods, opened at a price of 8.2 taels for several thousand packages yesterday, and quickly rose to 2.5 qian, making it quite popular. It was rumored that more N mark goods were continuing to arrive in thousands of packages and would continue to be offered. Moreover, the company was immediately packing HX mark at 6 taels and B mark at 6.5 taels, and was also willing to sell them, but the merchants lacked goods to offer, so no transactions were completed for the time being. The number plate included products from the Nanyang factory. The factory's ice sugar opened at several hundred packages, priced at 10.06 taels for No. 1 and 10.5 taels for No. 2, which were very popular. Furthermore, the previously designated "Nan" and "Yang" characters were changed to No. 1 and No. 2, with the Bagua trademark set to indicate differentiation.</p>

<p>The price of Xiamen sun-dried longan pulp previously temporarily stopped being quoted due to different origins and agents purchasing goods, and the price also became firmer. Lately, the inventory here has gradually become scarce, and the market situation has become stable. It was found that the Jinan轮 (ship name) from Xiamen imported over twenty boxes the day before yesterday. The samples were already seen yesterday, and the goods were still good. The price offered by various firms was slightly higher than before, at 30.5 taels.</p>

<p>The six double cocoon silk factories in this port, including Xinlun, have recently experienced brisk sales of double cocoon silk. The consumption of raw materials for processing and reeling has increased sharply, and the demand is very high. However, the inventory of double cocoons in the interior is scarce, and the supply is difficult to ease, falling short of demand. Although double cocoons from Hangzhou and Shaoxing have been shipped to Shanghai in recent days, the number has only been several dozen dan, with a maximum of just over one hundred dan. The market is becoming increasingly popular.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Lu Zhuang Gongxi green tea, the Russian Zhuang Association Foreign Firm, received a telegram from Moscow requesting additional orders, and the intention was even more urgent. The negotiations resulted in transactions of no less than a thousand boxes. The Baitou Zhuang Qianyi Foreign Firm also followed suit and began to order Gongxi, and the market was not deserted. Jinmei from Tunxi and Qimen black tea from Jinlong, Yihuo, and other firms all had telex transactions. The selling price of Jinmei was 70-80 taels, and the selling price of Qimen tea ranged from 25 to 41 taels. There were no fluctuations in the market prices.</p>

<p>As the weather has gradually turned cold, the sales of stoves and coal have gradually increased. The market transactions in this port have become even more lively in the past two days. The trading between market peers is also quite considerable. Yesterday, the whole city made the opening price for No. 1 lump coal: Kushima, Saga, Fushun, etc., 247 tons.

<p>The development of the automobile industry is faster than any other means of transportation, advancing a thousand miles a day and sweeping the globe. In a few decades, it has become an important issue in transportation. However, the gasoline used (commonly known as petrol) is very expensive. In the past ten years, the diesel engine has made rapid progress, and major power plants around the world have gradually switched to diesel engines. The latest trains have also adopted diesel engines, but their use in automobiles is still limited. According to a recent report from the British automotive industry, diesel cars have been successful, saving fuel, being durable, and setting new records in automotive engineering. Newspapers praised and celebrated the event across the country. In recent years, highways have been built in various provinces of China, and the annual consumption of fuel is considerable. If diesel engines can be used instead, up to one-sixth of the cost can be saved. I have translated the details of each car for your reference.</p>
<p>(1) Wardman Five-Seater car: This car has a ten-horsepower diesel engine installed in a typical five-seater car body. The engine shaft speed ranges from 200 to 1,200 revolutions per minute. The car's top speed is 20 miles per hour. A month ago, it was tested between London and Brighton, a round trip of 112 miles, consuming less than two gallons of fuel (British price is five pence per gallon, and each penny equals seven fen in national currency), costing nine pence, which can be considered extremely cheap. The previously mentioned difficulties of "Heavy Weight" and "High Compression" have been overcome, and the combustion is complete, with cleaner exhaust than gasoline. There is also a device for easy starting, without the need for a Magneto, Induction Coil, spark Plug, and Carburator. The igniter and mixer are the most easily damaged parts of a car, so the diesel engine car's parts are simple and easy to manage.</p>
<p>(2) Gardner type diesel bus: This car was manufactured by Crossley Motor Company, Manchester, using a Kai's (phonetic) diesel engine installed in a double-decker bus with 80 horsepower. It has traveled 30,000 miles without any damage. The test results were very perfect. The required fuel price is only one-sixth of ordinary gasoline. The diesel fuel consumption is only one-third, but the efficiency is doubled. The Economical Effecien reaches over 80 percent. Each hundred miles only requires a fuel cost of two shillings and seven pence. If gasoline were used, it would cost sixteen shillings and six pence. This car can accommodate 48 passengers and travel 40 miles per hour.</p>
<p>(3) Laffley lorry: This car also uses a diesel engine and carries four tons of gravel. It traveled 192 miles from Manchester to London in four hours and forty-eight minutes, consuming 9.75 gallons of fuel. The price per gallon was 5.5 pence, costing a total of four shillings and six pence. Its average speed was 21.8 miles per hour. This is a successful heavy-duty vehicle. Overall, the aforementioned diesel cars have become an important issue in the transportation industry. The ignition point of diesel is very high, unlike gasoline which is easy to ignite. The fuel storage is also safer. The exhaust after combustion does not have the odor of gasoline and contains less toxic gas. Starting the car is very easy, and the horsepower is sufficient. All of this is enough to surpass ordinary cars. As for the engineering advantages, due to space limitations, I cannot describe them in detail. I will discuss them later.</p>
<h3 id="e194">1931 Morris Car <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The 1931 Morris new car is now on display at Liham Machine Automobile Company, 694 Jing'an Temple Road. Its harmonious and beautiful colors, excellent style, and great utility are all captivating. As for its economic efficiency, safety, reliability, and various mechanical features, it is an unprecedented great contribution to the British automobile industry. The new car is divided into five groups, with various sizes and prices to suit the needs of people from all walks of life. Those who purchase it will find it exactly what they are looking for and will be satisfied.</p>
<p>There are three types of six-cylinder Morris new cars: Morris Major, Morris Cowley, and Morris Essex. There are two types of four-cylinder cars: Morris Minor and Morris Oxford. The horsepower of these models ranges from eight to eighteen. There are a total of eighteen types of car bodies, among which the Morris Minor sports car is the most worthy of mention, as its price is particularly low and truly surprising.</p>
<p>The Morris Major has 15 horsepower and six cylinders. The Cowley engine has been specially improved to increase horsepower and acceleration. The Cowley body and other parts have been refined to perfection. The Essex has 18 horsepower and is equipped with various new devices such as air purifiers and preheaters. Among the advantages of the new Morris car, the biggest one is the step-by-step lubrication method, which provides thorough lubrication without neglect, so its utility is greater and more durable.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Broadway Truck and Long-Distance Bus <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Solid construction, completely new, reduced transportation costs, fast and durable.</p>
<p>Today's cargo transportation tools must adapt to the ever-changing transportation needs of today. Old profitable trucks have been abandoned as waste by the current world.</p>
<p>The new Broadway 120 truck and long-distance bus are designed to meet the urgent needs of modern transportation. The new style and new products do not prevent comparison with other cars and are not old cars with new tires. The body structure is completely based on new ideas and the application of specialized knowledge to create a truck suitable for today.</p>
<p>Not only that, but all Broadway trucks have been inspected by experts and proven to be solid and reliable, and have been sold only after passing thousands of miles of vigorous testing with excellent results, so car owners trust them. In places with complex car affairs, rural transportation, and long-distance travel, the Broadway 120 truck can handle heavy loads.</p>
<p>Because of the solid construction and uniform mechanical power, it is durable and guarantees long-term service, reducing all costs. The powerful and sensitive motor generates fast speed and divine power, avoiding accidental dangers. The strong four-speed power transmission expands the driving range and adapts to various car affairs conditions. The rear axle is a fully floating single-cover low-drop helical bevel type, with large pointed wheels and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>Not only is the action excellent, but the appearance is also very outstanding. The style of the 120 truck is novel, and you will want to order it as soon as you see it. This kind of amazing vehicle has powerful capabilities and can handle various weights. With this truck, you can serve day and night, quickly, properly, and accurately. Broadway 120 is the most perfect truck and the most economical transportation tool of today.</p>
<p>The engine is mounted on four suspension points, so the hub is more stable. The crossbars on the three heavier wheelbases are equipped with double-acting shock absorbers, which minimize restraint and vibration. The extra-long semi-elliptical springs have been improved. The new spring shock absorbers and the underpan work together, so the quietness of the road and the comfort of driving and riding of Buick cars, even at the highest speed, cannot be surpassed by other cars.</p>
<p>The style of the low chassis is refreshing, and the car's chain hooks are simple and strong, eliminating the previous cumbersome procedures. The driving gears, spring chain hooks, and car body all have brackets and pillars with widths equal to the depth of the crossbars to ensure sufficient supporting force.</p>
<p>The 8-50 low chassis is shorter and lighter than the 8-60, 8-80, and 8-90, but its effectiveness is equal to that of the large low chassis. These types of cars are equipped with a (Hua Qie Ke Si) driver and single shock absorber.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Outline of Imperialist Colonial Policy <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Bin</p>
<p>Authored by Hu Shiming</p>
<p>Colonial policy is not only an extremely important part of politics but also the most significant issue in the world today. The Chinese people, living in a semi-colonial state, need to study this issue in detail. However, we must understand that behind modern colonial policy lies a terrifying picture of humanity, not a portrait of civilizational progress. It can be described as a bloody and chaotic painting filled with brutality, misery, weeping, and death, arousing both fear and indignation. This is a very obvious fact. We only need to look at the real lives of the Indian, Vietnamese, and Korean peoples to understand the true nature of colonial policy. Generally speaking, the people in colonies are treated worse than slaves, cattle, or fish; their lives and deaths are entirely at the mercy of the imperialists. As colonial policy becomes more aggressive, the fate of weak nations becomes more tragic. Even in our semi-colonial China, these so-called tragic realities can be seen at any time and any place. Indeed, colonial policy not only fails to promote the spread of civilization but also hinders culture and destroys humanity everywhere.</p>
<p>Regarding books on colonial policy, especially those with correct perspectives and centered on national consciousness, there are very few in Chinese publications. The purpose of this book by Mr. Hu is to enable the Chinese people to understand the true nature and actual situation of imperialist colonial policy. Therefore, it analyzes and explores in detail the reasons for imperialists' implementation of colonial policy and its inner workings. This is not only helpful for those studying politics and international issues but also provides the people of semi-colonial countries with the common knowledge they should have. The book is divided into eight chapters: (1) Introduction, (2) Classification of Colonies, (3) Origins of Modern Colonial Policy, (4) Imperialist Aims in Seizing Colonies, (5) Organization and Forms of Colonial Rule, (6) Imperialist Policies for Ruling Colonies, (7) Brief History of Modern Imperialist Colonialism, and (8) Conclusion. Finally, there is an appendix (Investigation of Colonies of Various Imperialist Countries in Recent Times), which is particularly detailed and valuable.</p>
<p>In the introduction, the author objectively explains the elements of imperialism and its past and present external aggression. It systematically discusses from ancient times to modern times, such as the external aggressions of Assyria and Babylon in the ancient East, the actual situation of Spanish and Portuguese colonial management at the beginning of the fifteenth century, and the fact that England became the world's largest colonial country after Spain. At the very least, it gives us a holistic and systematic understanding of the history of colonialism.</p>
<p>The author classifies colonies according to scientific methods, detailing how the policies adopted by various countries towards colonies differ and pointing out their characteristics. For example, the British divide colonies according to political organization into Crown Colonies and Self-Governing Colonies. Those directly under the rule of the Governor, who is subordinate to the British monarch, are called Crown Colonies. Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements belong to this category. Colonies with a constitution, a nominally self-governing system, and a parliament and officials elected by elections are called Self-Governing Colonies. Canada and the South African Union belong to this category. However, the author wants readers to see the characteristics of colonies and colonial policy by focusing on important aspects. Therefore, in addition to this classification, it is classified based on political conditions: (A) Independent Colonies, (B) Protectorates, (C) Leased Territories, and (D) Spheres of Influence. Each category has a detailed explanation based on the country to which the colony belongs. Secondly, it is classified based on economic conditions: (A) Settlement Colonies, (B) Trading Colonies, (C) Commercial Colonies, (D) Plantation Colonies, and (E) Military Colonies. The author's classification is profoundly meaningful and reasonable.</p>
<p>The driving force of modern colonial policy explores the main and secondary reasons for the vigorous implementation of colonial policy by modern imperialism, such as population growth, transportation development, military expansion, Christian propagation, and the activities of explorers. The last one, such as the Russians in Abyssinia and the British in Tibet, all use scientific investigation as a pretext for reconnaissance, which are extremely obvious facts.</p>
<p>The purpose of imperialist seizure of colonies explains what its purpose is, why it wants to invade colonies, and what benefits it has for itself. The author has detailed analyses of these major issues.</p>
<p>The organization and form of colonial rule: (1) The doctrine of governing colonies differs due to the circumstances and needs of each country. According to the author's research, it is divided into four types: (A) Assimilationism, (B) Autonomism, (C) Centralism, and (D) Distributionism. (2) The organization of colonial rule is roughly divided into three types of institutions: (A) Governing institutions in the mother country, (B) Governing institutions in the colony, and (C) Colonial companies. (3) The form of colonial rule varies depending on the circumstances of each country, so there are also some differences in various forms, but they can also be roughly divided into four types: (A) Protected Colony, (B) Chartered Colony, (C) Directly Ruled Colony, and (D) Autonomously Ruled Colony. The author has unique insights into each organization and form, which is worth our attention.</p>
<p>The author details the complex content of the imperialist policy of ruling colonies: (1) Political policies, (2) Financial policies, (3) Industrial policies, (4) Transportation policies, and (5) Policies towards scholars. These are all elaborated, allowing readers to understand the actual situation and are a very important chapter.</p>
<p>A brief history of modern imperialist colonies describes the earliest European countries engaged in colonial undertakings in order, such as the colonial history of Spain and Portugal, the colonial history of the Netherlands, and the colonial history of England. In Australia, it covers the colonization of New Zealand and Western Australia, among others. Secondly, it details the colonial history of France in North America, Italy, Japan, and the United States.</p>
<p>In short, the author's book is based on a modern perspective to analyze imperialist colonial policy. In other words, it is to awaken the weak nations of various countries. Of course, the people in the colonies themselves have long felt the pain. Although the entire book has only eight chapters, it comprehensively describes the origins, purposes, and content of colonial policy, as well as a brief history of the implementation of colonial policy by various imperialist countries, and its important aspects are all described without omission. The detailed investigation of the colonies of various imperialist countries at the end is sufficient for researchers to refer to. Sun Yat-sen has already said in the Three Principles of the People that our China has become a semi-colonial country, so we need to study this imperialist colonial policy even more. When there are few such books published in the country, Mr. Hu's book is worth recommending to readers.</p>
<p>[P Baoshan People</p>
<p>— Wang Tiehua</p>
<p>Edited by the Baoshan People's Education Center</p>
<p>The so-called nation naturally refers to all its members, and definitely not just the intellectuals of the nation. Therefore, the literature and art produced in a certain nation do not only refer to the works produced by intellectuals from their individual consciousness, but rather refer to the works produced from the life consciousness formed from the standpoint of the nation, and their value is estimated. This kind of folk heritage cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>In the past, this newspaper has introduced many books and newspapers about folk tales, folk legends, folk songs, etc. This kind of national art is indeed worthy of attention and recommendation to the public. Therefore, I dare to present "Baoshan People" for introduction.</p>
<p>"Baoshan People" is a bi-monthly publication edited by the Baoshan County People's Education Center. It has been working tirelessly for almost two years. Needless to say, the content is very rich. Fortunately, it can use simple writing to express sincere meanings and instill them into the general public. Each issue has short essays, anecdotes, news, songs, creations, etc., which are adjusted so that it does not feel boring or monotonous. What is most worthy of our attention is that many folk songs have been discovered here. At the same time, there are also many excellent works of short song creation and adaptation dedicated to the "people." Here are a few excerpts:</p>
<p>(Little chicken, yellow all over, which daughter doesn't miss her mother? When she misses her mother, there's nowhere to go, so she closes the door and cries. Although my parents-in-law treat me well, it's not as good as my own parents.)</p>
<p>(Eating doesn't make you poor, dressing doesn't make you poor, miscalculation makes you poor for life. I advise you to look at Fang Taigong in Nan Village. His calculation is the most accurate. The father-in-law carries burdens to sell yellow onions himself, and the mother-in-law can also cut bamboo to make lanterns. The eldest son does massage as a doctor, and the youngest son learns tailoring on Nan Village Street. The daughters-in-law spin yarn and weave cloth as female workers. Do you think his calculation is accurate? I advise everyone to look at Fang Taigong in Nan Village.)</p>
<p>Issue 28</p>
<p>The first song probably refers to a newly married woman, and the second vividly depicts a simple life in the countryside.</p>
<p>There are too many other songs to quote, so I can only excerpt a few below:</p>
<p>Build a school on the side of the road</p>
<p>Passed by several young girls</p>
<p>Angered several scholars</p>
<p>Mom, mom, mother, mother</p>
<p>Don't marry a scholar</p>
<p>If you want your husband and wife to reunite</p>
<p>Unless he comes back in different clothes</p>
<p>If you want your husband and wife to reunite</p>
<p>Unless the school is burned down by heavenly fire</p>
<p>If you marry a farmer</p>
<p>You sleep on a bench together during the day and in the same bed at night</p>
<p>Issue 30</p>
<p>Country girl</p>
<p>Wants to learn from Shanghai</p>
<p>Learns to death, learns not to be like</p>
<p>When she learns to be seven points like</p>
<p>Shanghai has already changed its style</p>
<p>South wind blows, north wind cools</p>
<p>Home flowers are not as fragrant as wild flowers</p>
<p>Home flowers quarrel and scold</p>
<p>Wild flowers discuss carefully</p>
<p>Issue 35</p>
<p>Excavating folk songs like this has made great contributions in "Baoshan People." At the same time, Mr. Zhu Yunzong, the author of many songs and dramas, has put in a lot of effort to use historical sites to make songs about the four seasons, using a language that the general public can understand to narrate an event, pretending to use popular folk songs to promote the consciousness of (avenging shame). This kind of work is naturally much greater than humming a few sentences of (Bright Moon and Gentle Breeze) and singing a few sentences of (Sister, I Love You).</p>
<p>Each "Four Seasons Mountain Song" has some (introduction) in front to make it easier for people to understand the facts. Now I excerpt a few sentences below:</p>
<p>(In spring, the peach blossoms are brightly colored, the British trafficked opium, many people were addicted, ruined their families, weakened the race, and harmed endlessly.</p>
<p>In summer, lotus flowers are full of ponds, Lin Zexu had a good intention, he tried his best to ban the trafficking of opium, and 20,000 boxes of (raw opium) were burned.)</p>
<p>Opium War</p>
<p>In addition, topics such as (province) and (county) can also give the public geographical and historical knowledge. Here is a song about (Baoshan County):</p>
<p>In spring, the plum blossoms are fragrant, Baoshan County is in the northern boundary of Jiangsu Province, south of Taicang, east of Shanghai, and west of the sea is Jiading. In summer, lotus flowers are full of ponds, the fields in Baoshan have been measured, and the area is more than 370,000 mu, a flat and good place. In autumn, osmanthus flowers are like gold, Baoshan County is divided into five districts, and each district has a district chief to handle affairs for the people. In winter, snowflakes are as white as cotton, Baoshan has a population of 160,000, everyone works hard to make progress, and will become a model county in the future. There are already many excerpts of songs, and I am afraid that panic will occur in the position, so I have to turn to other aspects.</p>
<p>We know that people's gatherings and entertainment are mixed with many feudal and superstitious ideas on the one hand, and also contain a very strong national spirit on the other hand. For this kind of group action, such as welcoming gods and holding temple fairs, dragon boat racing, singing flower drum operas, improper entertainment, etc., naturally cannot be absolutely prevented in (Baoshan), and their actions may not have enthusiastic expressions of feelings. The expression of group consciousness, organized actions, and active and vivid states are not inconsistent with the national spirit, so they should not be subject to negative prohibition. It is urgent to sort out and correct their consciousness and give play to it, turning the unconscious into conscious, which is indeed an important event in various places at present. There are also many discussions on this point in the publication.</p>
<p>In short, "Baoshan People" speaks for the people from the standpoint of the people and speaks to the people. At this time when (people's education) is in urgent need of popularization, the publication has a major responsibility and is worthy of recommendation and attention. At the same time, it is hoped that folk literature will be collected more, and such works with the purpose of seeking survival, freedom, and prosperity for the nation should be regarded as the treasure of national art and cannot be ignored.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Establishment of the Guangming (Brightness) Academic Society at the Faculty of Law and Politics <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>This semester, the organization of academic groups at the Faculty of Law and Politics has been quite active, and the Guangming Academic Society is particularly outstanding. However, in the past, we have not heard of the organization of the Guangming Academic Society. It is very gratifying to read the Guangming Bi-Monthly Publication, which is about to reach its third issue. Most students have expressed welcome and praise, which has aroused the sympathy of some people and a tendency to request to participate in joint efforts. Unexpectedly, the person in charge of the society is also very generous. Since it is difficult to refuse their sincerity, they agreed to become a tangible organization and openly solicit members. In total, more than 100 people have joined, which is truly the beginning of a new era. At 7:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, their inaugural meeting was held in the first classroom. The attendees were unusually crowded and all expressed their sincere attitude, so the spiritual nourishment was constant and persistent, which is truly admirable. In particular, although the general female students were shy and rarely spoke, I believe that their seriousness about the proposals and elections was all inspired by their inner selves and added a lot of color. Zhu Jianbai, Cao Huichuan, and Ms. Guo Shiying were immediately elected as the presidium. After the ceremony, Chairman Zhu Jianbai gave a report, which was roughly like this:</p>
<p>………In the past, our Guangming was an unorganized one. The Guangming Bi-Monthly Publication was also only responsible for by a few of us with similar interests. Initially, our motivation for launching it was also to feel the dangerous phenomenon in the entire youth world. This kind of stimulation made us uncover the inner depression and form the task of having to stand up to save. From all aspects, we observed that the performance of the current youth world everywhere reveals a state of being inferior. Because the will of young people is weak, they are easily trapped in an irredeemable situation. The Communist Party is recklessly instigating and creating one riot after another, and I don’t know how many young people with burning blood have been sacrificed. The Nationalists are insidiously anesthetizing, and I don’t know how many young people are having sleeping lion dreams, not only not moving forward but also going backward, even to the point of digging their own graves. At the same time, the so-called decadence and romance not only do not know to be ashamed but are staggering and proud. What kind of impact will such degeneration have on the future of national life? As for the cultural aspect, the Communist Party members are also using the two major strategies of the social science movement and the literary movement to desperately launch a chain offensive against us. When they talk about social science, they vigorously promote their radicalism, such as Marx and Kautsky. When they write literary works, they vigorously advocate class struggle, such as hunger, poverty, and ruin. Because young people do not have a central idea, they are often infected by it. Moreover, we also admit that the silence in the youth world is indeed not without reason. However, if we want to break the atmosphere of silence and replace it with a new situation, we must break that crisis. Therefore, we want to fulfill the responsibility of exploring the youth problem. In the youth's thinking, we have gained deep understanding and reflection. We should work hard on the anti-Marxist social science movement to avoid the general public from taking the wrong revolutionary path. Secondly, we should work hard on the nationalist literary movement, passively resisting proletarian literature and actively arousing national consciousness and promoting the realization of nationalism, in order to achieve the goal of freedom and equality for the entire nation. In terms of action, how can we eliminate the youth's morbidity and lead them to the bright path of upward, brave, creative, and revolutionary. Therefore, we first issued the Guangming Bi-Monthly Publication beyond our capacity, and recently we clearly organized our Guangming Academic Society. We are willing to advance on the predetermined path and pursue everything we want to pursue under the illumination of Guangming…</p>
<p>After the Chairman's report, the proposals were discussed and passed: (1) The Society should organize a tour group to broaden their knowledge. (2) The Society should organize a visiting group to visit various political groups and institutions. (3) Compile a roster of members. (4) Issue a declaration in the name of the General Assembly. (5) Expand the Guangming Bi-Monthly Publication into a booklet and change it to a monthly publication. The election results were as follows: Zhu Airen, Ms. Guo Shiying, Wu Wanbang, Li Erbai, Gu Yufei, Cao Huichuan, Mei Hongquan, Zhou Hanbin, Lu Jinsong, Ms. Xie Huichang, Ms. Chen Naizhi, Li Chunsen, Li Zheng, Lu Wei, and Ms. Wei Zhiping were elected as directors. Ms. Li Suzhen, Feng Guanjun, Wu Weicai, Ms. Ge Cairong, and Zhang Xiaorong were elected as alternates.</p>

<p>— Zhengtian</p>
<p>When I left Changsha for Shanghai, Zhujun put two dollars in my pocket and said to me:</p>
<p>(I want to start oil painting this semester. I can’t buy paintbrushes here, so please take the trouble to buy six paintbrushes for me. If the money is not enough, please pay for me a little and I will return it to you later. I am waiting to use them, so please be quick.)</p>
<p>(Okay, I'll buy them for you when I get to Shanghai.)</p>
<p>Shanghai arrived, one day, two days, three days, one week, two weeks, three weeks, the brushes are still in the stationery store. Friend, it's not that I forgot, but two dollars is not enough to buy six oil paintbrushes, not to mention that I have spent even the two dollars. I am anxious every day because I am sorry for you, but what can I do? Even if I use my personality as a guarantee, the stationery store will not sell the brushes on credit.</p>
<p>The airmail has arrived again for two days. Before I even opened it, I knew it was to urge me to buy the brushes. If I don't get a few dollars today, your telegram will arrive, won't it? Are you eager to indulge in oil painting, my friend?</p>
<p>The oil paintbrushes are probably cheaper at the Jincheng Arts &amp; Crafts Society, I thought, so I went all the way from Tiantong'an to Avenue Dubail.</p>
<p>I had bought the brushes and it was already 5:30 p.m. Although I had to rush back for dinner, we walked from Xinxinli to Avenue Joffre because taking a rickshaw would cost twice as much as taking the tram from the French Concession to Hongkou.</p>
<p>It was already the world of electric lights. Avenue Joffre is a region where foreign powers flaunt their strength. Besides foreign food stores, foreign clothing stores, and foreign department stores, there are hardly any stores opened by Chinese people. Next to them are densely arranged rows of foreign parasol trees. In the middle, there are flowing cars and horses mixed with deafening noise. At that crossroads, there was a majestic, tall horse with a man sitting on it, watching the rushing people without moving, as if even a green fly on the street could not escape his eyes. An Annamese stood underneath, just as tall as the horse's body, looking up to the man on the horse's command.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the man on the horse raised his finger, and the man under the horse immediately ran to the middle and stopped an old Chinese rickshaw driver's rickshaw. Then he went to the back and took the license off the rickshaw and ran back to present the license to the man on the horse with both hands. He took it and just nodded.</p>
<p>The old rickshaw driver, that poor rickshaw driver, was probably in the dim electric light, his old eyes were dazzled and violated the rules by taking one step too far or retreating one step too far.</p>
<p>The old rickshaw driver just helplessly put the rickshaw on the side of the road, his pair of pitiful eyes looking at his passenger. He was lamenting his own bad fate. He could not think of any way out.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a bitter smile wrinkled on his withered face. He was asking his passenger to plead with the patrol officer for him. The passenger, who was carrying a large bundle, was also an old man like him. He sympathized with him and walked to the patrol officer, but the patrol officer's reply was just to shake his baton at him. So he quietly retreated.</p>
<p>The old passenger just stared blankly at his bundle.</p>
<p>The old rickshaw driver just stared blankly at his rickshaw that he could do nothing about.</p>
<p>The two of them had forgotten the noise around them.</p>
