<p>倫敦海會成立協約之英美日三國。各在其議會中辯論。而辯論之中多有反對其本國政府者。其反對之意思。咸謂對於他國讓步過甚。而對於自己之國防有害。據是以言。然則受其益者誰耶。各國均認己國爲失敗。然則其得勝利者誰耶。各國之政府。無不有反對黨。而爲反對黨無不以是爲反對政府之具。故設詞之相同者宜也。</p>
<p>然就情勢以觀。各國雖有反對者。而各國必將終於批准此協約。何也。其反對之力。决不敵經濟壓迫之力也。海會之三國協約。其有補於三國經濟不少。而今日各國均在受經濟壓迫之時。故斷非一二反對者所能逆其勢而阻止其進行也。我嘗有言。今日世界而苟能减縮其軍備。决非愛好和平之心所能玉成。實爲經濟壓迫所逼成也。此次英美日三國政府。所以不懼國中反對。而毅然成立此協約者。蓋亦深悉此中情况故也。</p>

<p>自金漲銀賤以來、上海方面美國之大條銀、則源源進口、賡續不絶、而滬地之金洋、經美國大批收買運去者、先後二個月中、爲數至巨、致近來上海存留之金幣、僅及以前十分之一、市面將受影響、昨日忽有巨額金洋裝美、被海關查悉、禁阻出口、茲將詳情錄下、</p>
<p>財部禁金出口　、財政部鑒於上海金幣陸續出口、每次輸出恒有七八十萬元、恐激起金融上之變態、遂命令江海關禁止金幣現貨之報裝出口、江海關奉令後、除發布告外、並通知本埠各輪公司、在禁令頒布以後、不准再收裝金幣、代運至各國口岸、</p>

<p>二、陳先生是擁護中華民國討伐袁逆的首義者、袁世凱稱帝、本黨决加討伐、惟其時逆氛猖獗、各方佈置極嚴、上海駐兵尤重、當時先生奉命討袁、乃不辭艱險、於上海首先發難、遣人刺殺鎭守使鄭汝成、密令肇和軍艦發難、以促成西南革命勢力之聨合、卒將袁氏推倒</p>

<p>十三那天。會塲招待如黄警頑。朱少屏等。忙碌奔波。把會塲佈置得井井有條。二時以後。男女健兒百餘人。聨翩蒞止。精神抖擻。不愧中華健兒本色。惜名震一時的孫桂雲。獨獨沒有降臨趙德新君因病重缺席。怪傑劉長春。一足顚跛的勉强到會。據說足傷一時尙難復原。似乎令人擔憂。德高望隆的九旬叟馬湘伯。也扶杖光臨。此老眞興致不淺。二時半全體攝影後。賓主就席。舉行典禮。各位演說。都含有至深的意義。不涉恭維敷衍的陋習。陳德徵的開會詞。本「君子愛人以德」的婆心。帶忠告與警告的口吻。反對人家瞎捧塲。希望選手注意衛生。和行爲。在在要顧及國家的體面與光榮。馬湘老演說。撫今追昔。備極沉痛。他說中國現狀如此。是我們自巳失了主人翁的天職。中國人好講表面。記得袁世凱當國時。告以北京的警察辦理得如何好。自詡不讓外人。我回他說。外表一樣。實質還差。袁聞之不以爲樂。望健兒們加以猛省。又說日人陰險狡詐。昔有霍元甲者。膂力過人。各國大力士均非其敵。後遭日人忌。結果死於毒手。老人洞濁其奸。聽者爲之髮指。體育家吳蘊瑞說。我國選手非氣體不足。乃方法不善。此行最好能攝取他們的運動姿勢。歸後以資楷模。劉津珠說日人藐視我同胞。竟以劣等民族來侮辱。諸君在東時。應隨處注意衛生。說話勿高聲怪呌。比賽時即遇不公平。萬勿動武。對於日人惡劣的奸計。形容盡致。最後逯明代表選手團接受二十四團體所贈「我武維揚」的黄色綢旗。并代答詞。語甚得體。他大意說各校有體育指導之名而無指導之實。許多人把運動的責任。付諸少數選手。沒有整個的計劃。看作選手是特殊階級。不啻對誤解體育者。痛下針砭。末後賓主相敬一鞠躬而散。</p>
<p>十五日。天氣晴朗。微風拂拂。早晨七時。匯山碼頭。巳經人頭簇簇。門前車水馬龍。擁擠不出。中華選手八時後陸續到來。男的女的。都是喜洋洋的神氣十足。各報攝影記者手忙脚亂。大有應接不暇之槪。黄警頑自稱導演。記者們得他的助力不小。孫桂雲最怕人替伊拍照。而記者們却都要嘗試一下。據伊說早晨總計給人照了四五十張。李杏花、李牡丹也照了不少。東北大學德敎授步起（譯音）夫婦也很受人注目。他俩都是體育家。而且是新結婚的。乘機渡蜜月。一對新人兒。對東北選手頻加撫慰。伊碰到照相時。有忸怩之態。步起到很直爽。捉着夫人一定要攝入。两人拉拉牽牽。觀者爲之捧腹。張伯苓是中華隊總代表。一到輪埠。歡送諸人。爭與握手。他似乎很怕麻煩。便一溜烟起到輪船最高的一層。和船主大副們談天去了。郝伯陽後到爲主。中外人士。找他說話的很多。他蹀躞於人叢之間。滿面笑容。日本某女校及某商會贈紀念旗二幀。上繡“GreatChina”等字。郝代表全體。欣然領受。至九時半。來者愈衆。輪上鑼聲勃起。送行者和旅客們接着忙了一陣。只見五彩紙圈。交相投擲。一霎時佈滿得密如蛛網。臨風招展。煞是有趣。十時汽笛一聲。大洋丸蠕蠕移動。拉拉的呼聲。學鏗鏘的樂聲。漸漸微弱了。千餘送客。和健兒們暫告小别。</p>
<h3 id="c198">佛曲　持佛 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>我國方音。各地不同。吳儂軟語。中州閎壯。閩粤唪舌。未嘗同一音調也。唯念佛鴂經之時。高唱讚禮西方。魚磐嘹喨。梵唄鏗鏘。舉國若一轍也。或謂念佛。凈修之事。何必律叶宮商。宣揚佛號。高唱佛曲。桑門戒律中。有不作倡伎樂之說也。不知音樂感人最深。念佛而敲魚擊磬。打鐘鳴鼓。正所以協和心性。聖人治世之大法。禮樂二字。儒家言之最詳。我佛門中選擇圓通本根。大智文殊。獨取耳根。觀音得道最早。其修成即從聞性得旨。娑婆衆生。不解此理。或詆和唱。或號佛曲。不亦謬乎。須知念佛而叶宮商。爲蓮宗第四祖法照大師所倡。所謂五會大會。甚有深意者也。</p>
<h3 id="c199">阿戇的肚子　古蓮 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>阿巧看見報紙上登着烟台啤酒益利汽水在新世界大贈飲的廣告。歎爲希有之便宜機會。拉了阿戇同去白相新世界。阿戇在路上對阿巧說。「化了两角小洋。可以喝十瓶八瓶的啤酒。一打半打的汽水。那啤酒和汽水的老閶。未免太犧牲了。大槪他們眞正是阿戇。我叫阿戇的。倒有些不相信。」阿巧說。「你又要自作聰明了。偌大公司那有騙人的道理。他們两人到了新世界裏面。果然瞧見許多人擁在一起。儘量暢飲。沒有限止。阿戇快活得話也說不出。一連就喝了七瓶半啤酒。登時把個肚子凸了起來。實在裝不下了。纔回頭去喝了汽水。阿巧說。「你酒巳喝飽了。汽水可以停一回再來喝。也不遲啊。」阿戇想一想道。「咦。我裝酒的肚子滿了。裝汽水的肚子還空着哩。」阿巧笑道。「你倒底是阿戇。一個人那有两個肚子呢。」</p>
<p>參觀威尼施商人中之一幕</p>
<p>— 昌鉞</p>
<p>疇昔之晚。不佞因事訪愛美劇名導演家應君雲衛。適值戲劇協社排演莎翁偉搆「威尼施商人」中之私奔一幕。不佞得先覩之快。深自慶幸。該劇譯自英文。純用國語對白。竊爲文學之中。以繙譯爲最難。往往有去菁留蕪之弊。獨該劇能免其通病。詞句措置。都能適合我國文法。加以演員讀音正確。聲調清晰。故盡人咸能了解。</p>
<p>啓幕之時。先有帮助私奔之把風二人。手持火把。等候該幕主角陸倫。以便偕行。而陸久久不至。彼二人乃大發議論。將情人之約會。及愛情之意義。發揮無遺。而其中哲理。又切合海上時髦人物之現狀。旁敲側擊。入木三分。苟彼虎頭蛇尾朝秦暮楚者流。能聆此妙論而不愧死者。我不信也。</p>
<p>旣而陸怱怱上。指背後之華厦輕聲謂其把風曰。「我的岳父就住在這裏。」爲狀頗得。忽見屋内人影。似屬男性。乃驚駭異常。旋即察得屋内之男性。即其戀人。蓋巳易釵而弁矣。於是欣喜之色。又溢眉宇。海誓山盟。曲盡两情繾綣之妙。奔逃時。全塲空氣殊爲緊張。背人私行。固宜若是。</p>
<p>總觀是幕。演來入情入理。無懈可擊。演員四人。皆能不失身份。而其中尤以飾陸倫之某君爲最難得。某君面目清秀。軀幹魁偉。莊諧俊美。兼而有之。與前銀幕明星范倫鐵諾。相似之處頗多。在此幕中。表演得意·驚駭·欣喜·慌張·等狀。無不維妙維肖。各種轉變。更爲該劇生色不少。應君慧眼。得此良材。其眞世有伯樂。然後有千里馬歟。（不受酬）</p>

<p>我們就要起程往芝加哥。預定出演十天。即赴舊金山。再往檀香山。即便回國了。畹華狠有一鼓作氣游歐的雄心。惟同行的人離家日久。歸思極切。故躊躇未定。且看彼時情形再行酌定。這幾天雖然停演休息。畹華還是忙不了。畫像的。照像的。雕塑的。新聞記者。劇界中人。還有慕名請見的。眞是如山陰道上。應接不暇。而茶會讌會。同時又依然不絶。晚上又同張彭春先生等往各劇團觀劇。熱心研究。</p>
<p>二十三晚上。畹華宴請各界。到的人狠多。席間說了幾句冠冕堂皇的話。大意謂這次初來貴國。承各界特别歡迎。最可感謝。但願两國因藝術關係。而增進國際間的友誼。諸公對於中國藝術這樣的贊許。謹代表中國藝術界敬謝厚意云云。來賓盡歡而散。</p>
<p>畹華的確瘦了許多。大約係體勞過率的緣故。但　神仍不少减。自在此間大告成功之後。態度上尤見謙謹。眞是呌人佩服。</p>
<p>此地有一位大評戲家楊SiarhYoung先生。他是最崇拜畹華藝術的。前天送給一個戒指。是五百年前羅馬的東西。其餘送紀念物品的人。非常的多。</p>
<p>去年在國内見某報登載巴黎通訊。巴黎有萬國戲劇恊會之成立。我國參與者爲謝壽康博士。曾於大會席上提出明年（即今年）請畹華赴巴黎之議。當時各國代表均極贊成。但用費太鉅。後由會長法人莫美氏法國國立第二戲院院長）計議。擬以恊會名義函致莫斯科柏林沿途各大戲院招待表演。或不至發生困難云云。今旣有游歐之議。或可以接洽。但恐短時間内。不及籌備。祗好回國後再說。明年芝加哥開一極大博覽會。有人想替畹華編一齣有世界眼光的戲。預備請他來唱。都說比美國伶人演來一定好。於此亦可知美人心理中崇拜的一般。</p>

<h3 id="e4">London Naval Conference and Debates in Various National Parliaments <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The three countries, Britain, the United States, and Japan, that formed the agreement at the London Naval Conference are debating it in their respective parliaments. In these debates, many oppose their own governments. The meaning of their opposition is generally that too many concessions have been made to other countries, which is detrimental to their own national defense. If this is the case, then who benefits? Each country believes it has failed, so who is the victor? Every government has opposition parties, and these parties invariably use this as a means to oppose the government, so it is fitting that their rhetoric is similar.</p>
<p>However, judging from the situation, although there are oppositions in various countries, they will ultimately approve this agreement. Why? Because the power of opposition cannot match the power of economic pressure. The tripartite agreement of the Naval Conference is of great benefit to the economies of the three countries, and today all countries are experiencing economic pressure. Therefore, a few opponents cannot reverse the trend and stop its progress. I have said before that if the world can reduce its armaments today, it is not due to a love of peace, but because it is forced by economic pressure. The reason why the governments of Britain, the United States, and Japan are not afraid of domestic opposition and resolutely established this agreement is that they are well aware of this situation.</p>

<h3 id="e8">Sino-French Vietnam Treaty Signed <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Main Treaty with Eleven Articles</p>
<p>Fourteen Annexes</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sino-French Vietnam Trade Treaty was formally signed at 10 PM on the 16th at the diplomatic residence in Sajiwan. Those present on our side were Wang Zhengting, Xu Mo, Hu Shize, Zhang Weihan, and Zhu Shiquan, the assistant of the European and American Affairs Department, and on the French side were Martel, Secretary Lanbisi, and the French Consul Baron de. The signing was completed at 10:30 PM. The content includes eleven articles of the main treaty and fourteen notes exchanged between China and France, agreeing on the issue of transit tax and the establishment of consulates. The regulations of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway have also been agreed upon, and the articles that are not suitable for the current situation have been revised. Ambassador Fama has telegraphed the full text to Paris, and after receiving a reply, a date will be set for publication. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xu Mo, the Director of the European and American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters who visited him after the signing of the Sino-French Vietnam Treaty that the negotiations for the Sino-French Vietnam Treaty have been ongoing for nearly five years without success. After the establishment of the National Government, it formally negotiated with the French side about 24 times, and informally negotiated about 10 times. It has only come to an end today. Among them, the issues of establishing consulates, transit tax, and revising the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway regulations have been substantially resolved. Personally, I feel that diplomatic problems are extremely difficult, especially treaty negotiations. Therefore, it is not easy to achieve full satisfaction. Because both sides have their minimum requirements, and being able to obtain satisfaction at the minimum level is considered a good result. Whether this Vietnam Treaty is satisfactory depends on how each party views it. After the treaty is signed, it will be submitted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the National Government for approval. Ambassador Fama needs to go to Japan urgently and left for Shanghai tonight after signing the treaty. He plans to go to Beijing on the 17th and then to Japan to take up his new position as ambassador. It is said that French Minister Wilden has also set off for China. Before the new French Minister arrives, we will continue to work with the personnel of the French Embassy in China on other outstanding Sino-French issues. As for the issue of the French Concession, after our country sent a note to the French side, the French side has replied. We originally intended to conduct negotiations immediately, but Ambassador Fama was busy with the Vietnam Treaty and had no time for this. It has not yet been decided whether to wait for the new French Minister to come before negotiating, or to negotiate in another way. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Weihan arrived in Beijing from Shanghai at 9 PM on the 16th and went to the diplomatic residence to participate in the signing of the Vietnam Treaty.

His luggage has been packed in Shanghai, and he has booked a passage on the Chichibu Maru from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the morning of the 17th, and then he will go to Yunnan. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sino-French Vietnam Treaty was delayed until 10 PM on the evening of the 16th due to the cumbersome transcription procedures. It is reported that the content includes: 1. All of the original treaty's Vietnamese transit tax, Vietnamese passport tax, and preferential tariff treatment for goods imported and exported across the Sino-Vietnamese border stipulate that the conditions of reciprocal and equal treatment are to be met. 2.

<h3 id="e52">British House of Commons Discusses Naval Conference Work <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Conservatives and Liberals Engage in Heated Debate</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th - Today, the House of Commons debated the work and results of the London Naval Conference. Prime Minister MacDonald spoke first, saying that he was convinced that the basis of international naval understanding must be an agreement between Britain and the United States. Now this work has been completed. Britain cannot obtain security solely with a tripartite agreement. If other countries do not exceed this standard, the Admiralty is willing to maintain fifty cruisers within a limited period. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Churchill said that the current agreement is not an equal treaty between Britain and the United States, but a formal document in which Britain admits that its naval power is behind. The Conservative Party bears no responsibility for this agreement and will consider the entire situation in the future. Liberal Lambert welcomed the agreement as a step forward in British-American relations and praised Japan, saying that Japan fulfilled its obligations to Britain during the war, and that Japan had no doubts even after the Anglo-Japanese alliance was cancelled. Lambert asked if the government was proceeding with the Singapore naval base. He advocated stopping the work on the naval base, in view of the signing of the Anglo-Japanese Arbitration Convention. Left-wing Labourite Barrow urged the government to put forward a more bold disarmament proposal, and advocated that Gibraltar and the Suez Canal be placed under international joint administration. Liberal leader George said that the understanding reached by the United States, Britain, and Japan in London is more valuable than one hundred cruisers. The result of the Naval Conference, in terms of the deep sea, is satisfactory, but in terms of the narrow sea, it is far from perfect, and in many places it is worse than before, because it provokes suspicion and competition. During the debate, George and Churchill engaged in a heated debate. George criticized Churchill, saying that he should not cite Lord Curzon's private order to Balfour at the Washington Conference. Churchill replied that he had not made any new revelations, and that this instruction was relevant to the discussion of the case. George said that it would be very harmful to recognize this principle, and that the Conservative leader Baldwin should be asked to express his opinion on this. Baldwin hesitated for a moment and then said that there were no clear regulations on what documents a retired cabinet member could cite. He thought he could consider this point with George and one or two cabinet experts and dispel his doubts. MacDonald said that he would like to help Baldwin do so, but that today's matter was beyond doubt, and that Churchill should have obtained the consent of the House of Commons before reading this secret order. Although Churchill admitted his mistake, he said that the sentence he cited was not harmful. Naval Minister Alexander said that the Conservatives criticized the London Treaty. Did they want to tell the people that they would abolish the treaty as soon as they had the opportunity? Conservative Emery replied that any government could not abolish a formally concluded treaty, but that when the treaty was reconsidered in 1935, it should be given a more cautious discussion than the current government. The debate was suspended indefinitely at this point. Eighty-two Conservative MPs issued a notice proposing a motion that the House of Commons believed that the third part of the London Naval Treaty, concerning light ships, was in conflict with the interests of the British Empire and could not be ratified.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th - The document cited by Churchill in the House of Commons today was a cable instruction given to Balfour in 1921 when he represented Britain at the Washington Naval Conference. The most important section is as follows: "France, in addition to the submarine and cruiser construction of various countries, has the freedom to create a large submarine fleet, so we cannot set any restraints on our own freedom. We should build cruisers of unlimited number and unlimited types, as we deem necessary to maintain the life of our country and empire, and to resist submarine vessels."</p>

<p>Major Naval Factions State Their Opinions Japanese Government Approval Still Pending</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 15th - The US Senate's review of the nature and history of the London Naval Convention continued today. On the one hand, Secretary of the Navy Adams attended the Foreign Relations Committee to present the process, while Vice Admiral Pratt expressed his opinions before the Naval Affairs Committee. Adams stated the gains and losses on the point of British-American naval equality, saying that the United States Navy should not be in a hurry to build up to a level equal to Britain before 1936. He also firmly adhered to this purpose when attending the London Naval Conference this time, because being too radical would overwhelm American shipyards, and he feared that hasty action would be unsatisfactory. Proceeding step by step according to the Naval Convention Agreement, one could achieve equality with Britain after 1936. As for the specific time, it would all depend on the policy adopted by the United States. Adams also answered questions from the various committee members, saying that during the term of this agreement, naval equality between Britain and the United States would be difficult to achieve. The US representative had strongly argued for the 21 eight-inch gun cruiser plan proposed by the central department, but because Britain opposed it, the United States had to compromise and accept the 18-ship limit. As for six-inch gun cruisers, they are sometimes very effective weapons. The United States did not make any major sacrifices to achieve equality. The construction of gunboats is purely a waste of money. Pratt said that the London Convention has been established, and the United States can start a multi-year naval construction program for naval equality, saving a lot of expenditure each year. This is the first time in American history, and I strongly approve of abolishing submarines, but I do not want to announce the reasons in public. Vice Admiral Jones told the Foreign Relations Committee that he opposed the policy of dividing cruisers into two categories. Britain has restricted the eight-inch gun cruisers that are most suitable for our US application. Secretary of State Stimson reiterated at the end of his presentation that this agreement was by no means comparable to empty talk, but was all about being realistic.</p>
<p>Denko, Tokyo, 16th - The government's procedures for approving the London Naval Treaty hope to be expedited due to internal and external relations, but because of the organization of the treaty text, the issue of command, and the complicated relationship with the military, approval may still take a considerable amount of time. Wakatsuki's return to China is at the end of next month, and it may be difficult to catch up with the cabinet meeting before the summer vacation in July. However, the government is optimistic about the Privy Council, as the House has already fully passed important bills during this session, and it will not be difficult on this. In the event of a veto or censure, it will resolutely confront it head-on. The cabinet meeting today carefully studied countermeasures.</p>

<p>Wang Jinyu and Others Are Advancing Towards Xuchang</p>
<p>Xu Yuanquan's Army Attacks Ye County in Two Routes</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the meeting between Yan and Feng in Zhengzhou, Northwestern troops have been gathering one after another, and the Central Army's various units have also been deploying strictly in the area around Luohe. The war is about to break out. Until the 10th of this month, the Third Army Corps Headquarters moved to Xinyang and advanced to Zhumadian. He Chengjun also personally went to the front line in Luohe for inspection, but there were still no fierce battles. Only small patrol soldiers had conflicts, and planes reconnaissance and dropped bombs. In the last two days, the situation has gradually become tense. The 47th Division of Shangguan Yunxiang, the 54th Division of Hao Mengling and other troops, led by Wang Jinyu, the commander of the 9th Army, crossed the river on the 12th and advanced towards Linying. The original stationing in Linying was the Fan Zhongxiu department. Fan was in Xuchang, and Yan ordered him to withdraw, which angered Fan. He still expressed his obedience to the Central Government, so when Wang and others arrived in Linying on the 13th, Fan's troops all raised flags to welcome them. Linying was obtained without firing a shot and is now advancing towards Xuchang. Xu Yuanquan, the commander of the 10th Army, Yang Hucheng, the commander of the 7th Army, and Xiao Zhichu, the commander of the 44th Division, also attacked Ye County in two routes. It is said that they are already under siege. After Ye County is captured, they will take advantage of the victory to capture Baofeng. The air force has a particularly advantageous position in this operation. It is estimated that there are more than 90 aircraft in the aviation department, including the 1st aircraft team led by captain Zhang Yougu, 3rd aircraft team led by captain Yang Hexiao and 1st water aircraft team led by captain Tian Yi. These have been dispatched to the front, and have been daily flying to Zhengzhou, Heshangqiao, Yexian, and Yellow River Bridge and other places, where they have dropped bombs, killing many enemies. The Northwest Army in Zhengzhou seems to be under severe pressure. For the sake of commanding convenience, the director of aviation, Zhang Huichang, led a new type of fighter aircraft to Wuhan from Beijing on the 14th, and went north on the 15th, carrying a large amount of gasoline and heavy bombs as preparation for continued bombing of the Northwest Army. It is heard that He Chengjun is now in Zhumadian, and plans to issue a general attack order today (15th), and limit the various armies to meet in Zhengzhou within ten days. It is expected that the military affairs on the Pinghan Line will be developed in the next few days. (May 15)</p>
<h3 id="e58">Central Army Recovers Bozhou <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Rumors Also State that Luyi Has Been Occupied</p>
<p>A dispatch from Bengbu reports that Bozhou in northern Anhui Province, situated on the upper reaches of the Wo River, was once known for its prosperity. However, in recent years, it has suffered repeatedly from military plunder and banditry, and its vitality was greatly diminished long ago. On February 10th of this year, Sun Dianying's troops, claiming to number 80,000 but in reality possessing only 20,000 to 30,000 armed men, arrived from Henan Province. The officers and soldiers were a diverse mix, stationed in the Guide, Luyi, and Zhecheng areas. They demanded supplies from the local populace daily. Soon after, they sent representatives to the Central Government to express their allegiance. General Commander Chiang appointed Sun as the commander of the 27th Army of the Punitive Expeditionary Force, hoping he would serve the Central Government. However, Sun then defected to Yan Xishan, who appointed him as the commander-in-chief of the 8th Route Army, ordering him to invade southward. The Central Army had long been stationed in the Nansuzhou, Yongcheng, Guoyang, and Taihe areas, waiting in full battle array. At the beginning of this month, the Central Army was preparing to launch an offensive when Sun's troops in Luyi and Bozhou, numbering more than two divisions, suddenly mutinied. They collapsed before the battle, their morale greatly weakened. When the Central Army launched a three-pronged attack, Sun's troops retreated in disarray.岳相如's部隊， numbering over a thousand, were completely annihilated. Starting from the 8th, the 10th Division of the central route, under Yang Shengzhi, successively occupied Yimenji, Geng Huangsi, Chengfuzhai, Shatuji, Zhonggutang, Dinggusi, Zhangxinliu, Nitaidian, Xinji, Dashiji, Leizhai, Shijili Gou, Guanyintang, Sanguanmiao, Shizihe, Yuji Bridge, and other villages and strongholds. The 20th Brigade of the 7th Division of the eastern route, under Chen Xueshun, successively occupied Wenji Baoanji, Wumagou, Lao Juntang, and other places. The 2nd Regiment of the newly formed 21st Division of the western route, under Li Yunjie, occupied Feihekou Baimayi, and other places. The three routes advanced steadily, capturing and killing numerous enemies. Subsequently, Sun's troops retreated to Bozhou, and the Central Army besieged the county seat. The air force sent planes to reconnoiter and drop bombs. Under pressure from the Central Army, Sun Dianying sent representatives to Xu again, expressing his willingness to surrender. The Central Army, considering his repeated betrayals, rejected his request. On the 11th, Yang Shengzhi's troops launched a fierce attack from all sides. By 4:00 PM, Bozhou had fallen. The staff office of the Commander-in-Chief's train headquarters issued a victory report stating, "Our Yang Shengzhi's division truly occupied Bozhou at 4:00 PM this afternoon, capturing over 10,000 enemy soldiers, seizing six artillery pieces and over 5,000 rifles. Sun Dianying's troops were routed and fled westward." It is reported that the remnants of Sun's troops retreated along the Wo River towards Zhecheng. According to another source, the newly formed 21st Division under Li Yunjie has occupied Luyi. With the Northwestern Army having lost key positions in succession, the war in eastern Henan will be easily resolved. (May 14th)</p>

<p>A dispatch from Guangzhou reports that military conflict has erupted again in Guangxi Province. The two armies at the front began engaging each other on the 6th. The initial contact was between the newly formed 1st Division of the Punitive Expeditionary Force against Guangxi, under Zhu Weizhen, at Bitan in northern Xunzhou, and the Mo Shujie regiment of the enemy forces from the Wuxuan area. They clashed on the morning of the 6th, engaging in a fierce battle for approximately two hours, with both sides suffering dozens of casualties. Later, the 6th and 8th Route Armies learned that the enemy forces were sending a main force to break through Wuxuan and cross the Dahe River to relieve the siege of Xunzhou. Consequently, starting from the 7th, the newly appointed Xunliu Garrison Commander Zhou Xin issued a proclamation, blockading the Da Huangjiang River, prohibiting all ships, large and small, from passing through, in order to prevent spies from sneaking in. All officers of the various units stationed in Wuzhou were ordered to return to their original defenses before the 9th. The special advance teams of the 6th and 8th Route Armies, including grenade squads and broadsword teams, totaling several thousand men, would cross the river immediately after the general attack order was issued. Zhu Shaoliang, the commander-in-chief of the 6th Route Army, oversaw everything in Liuchen. Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of the 8th Route Army, returned to Ge and then, at 2:00 PM on the 7th, accompanied by Navy Commander Chen Ce, Chief of Staff Huang Renhuan, and Chief Advisor Yang Dingzhong, arrived at Daan aboard the Jianru warship to inspect the defenses and deploy military forces. He returned to Wuzhou on the 9th and went to the front lines again to supervise the troops. However, the Zhang-Gui forces learned that the 6th and 8th Route Armies were actively preparing to attack Xunzhou. Consequently, they first transferred troops from Guixian and other places to Wuxuan, Binyang, and Liuzhou. Zhang Fakui's army moved to Liuzhou, Li Zongren's army moved to Binyang, and Huang Shaoxiong's troops remained to defend Xunzhou, constructing defensive fortifications on the Fuchuanling Ridge and other strategic locations west of Xunzhou, and deploying trenches and landmines outside the city. Liang Chaoji's troops of the Gui army, after learning that troops had been transferred from Guixian to Wuxuan, suddenly led their team from Wuxuan on the 7th, taking the Dongxiang route north of Xunzhou to attack Jiangkou, invading Pingnan. Upon hearing this news, the 6th and 8th Route Armies, realizing that the front lines were suddenly under severe pressure, urgently dispatched Li Yangjing's division and Huang Yanzhen's brigade of the 8th Route Army, and Xu Kexiang's brigade of the 6th Route Army to jointly resist. On the 7th, the two sides engaged in a major battle in Pingnan. The enemy's forces were limited, and after being attacked by the Huang and Xu brigades, they were unable to withstand the attack and quickly collapsed. On the 8th, the Xu brigade, together with the fleet, attacked Jiangkou, and the Huang brigade continued to advance. Liang's troops retreated along Dazhuang, Dongxiang, and other places, back to Wuxuan. On the morning of the 9th, the rear echelon of the Li division advanced again towards Jiangkou. The 6th and 8th Route Armies planned to take advantage of the situation by avoiding a frontal assault on the naturally fortified Xunzhou, where heavy casualties would be inevitable, and instead take the opportunity to bypass Jiangkou, taking the Dazhuang-Dongxiang-Sanli route to attack Wuxuan, a distance of about 160 li. If Wuxuan falls, the communication between Liuzhou and Xunzhou will be cut off (Wuxuan is located about 100 li north of Xunzhou). If the Gui army loses Wuxuan, Xunzhou will not be able to hold out for long. (May 11th)</p>

<p>Guo's Troops Advance from Su-Tai</p>
<p>Xia and Dai Advance from Luotian</p>
<p>A dispatch from Anqing reports that banditry has recently spread rampantly in Anhui Province, leading to the fall of several cities. Although Huoshan has been recovered by the newly formed 5th Brigade under Pan Shanzhai, bandits fled from Xitan Town in western Huoshan to Xixi south of Lu'an on the 8th, burning and looting along the way. The Lu'an County Party Committee wired the province yesterday, requesting an urgent order for the National Army stationed in Shu to strike head-on from Xiaotian. The 1st regiment and 1st battalion of the 15th Independent Brigade, under Tang Yunshan, have arrived in Anhui from Jiangxi. On the evening of the 12th, the 3rd battalion of the 2nd regiment of that brigade, under Qi Ying, arrived aboard the Xing Shi steamer from Xun, and were stationed in various locations. They will soon head to western Anhui to suppress the bandits. However, the remnants of Yu Yanong's bandit group, led by Han Shijie, have repeatedly harassed Susong and Taihu counties, and are still entrenched in Yingshan. The provincial government has wired the Hankou Xingying, ordering Guo Rugui to dispatch troops to jointly suppress them. A reply telegram has been received, stating that troops have already been sent to suppress the bandits. The incoming and outgoing telegrams are recorded below to show the current situation of bandit suppression: (1) To the esteemed Anhui Provincial Government: Your telegram of 豔 has been received. Guo's army under Wang is currently in Wuxue. An order has been wired to send troops to Wuzushan Yingshan to suppress the bandits. Special reply, hoping Pan's brigade will intercept and suppress them. He Yingqin respectfully kowtows, 30th year, wu can yin. (2) To the esteemed Director He of the Hankou Xingying: Your telegrams of 30th and wu have been respectfully received. According to the telegram from the Taihu County Magistrate, Han's bandit gang is still entrenched in Yingshan. Huoshan County has already been recovered by Pan's brigade. The bandits' lair is located at Yanzihe, on the border between Huoshan and Henan Province. In addition to Pan's brigade, it is requested that Guo's army be wired to advance from Susong and Taihu, and the Xia and Dai armies to advance from Pantian, so that they can jointly suppress them from three sides and quickly eliminate them. Please review and reply. Your humble servant, Ma Fuxiang, Anhui Provincial Government, auspicious seal. (3) To Director Pan, Commander of the 5th Brigade, Lu'an Exploration and Delivery: I have received Director He of the Hankou Xingying's telegram of 30th wu, stating that Guo's army under Wang in Wuxue has been wired to advance to suppress the communist bandits in Wuzushan and Yingshan.

As for the communist bandits' lair, it is located at Yanzihe in Huoshan. In addition to wiring Director He again, requesting that Guo's army be wired to advance from Susong and Taihu, and the Xia and Dai armies to advance from Luotian, so that they can jointly suppress them from three sides with your brigade, I am sending this telegram to inform you.

<p>Ning and Yong Counties Lost Last Year</p>
<p>Lianhua's Capture Has Also Been Half a Year</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang reports that Ninggang, Yongxin, and Lianhua in western Jiangxi, which border Lingxian, Chaling, and Youxian in Hunan, are connected by continuous mountain ranges. Ning and Yong counties have not been recovered since they were occupied by the communist bandits Yuan Wencai, Wang Zuo, and Liu Zuoshu last year. Although there was an anti-communist团 organization recently, it lacked much power. As for Lianhua, it is more convenient due to its proximity to Pingxiang, and there is often a garrison of over one regiment in Pingxiang, so the county seat has been captured and lost repeatedly. According to news from western Jiangxi, the four townships of Lianhua are completely a communist world again. All residents are living under the communist iron heel.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The county seat has been captured by bandits for half a year. County Magistrate Chen has moved the county government to Gaolongshi in Chaling, Hunan Province to conduct business. When Peng's bandits were defeated by Deng Ying's 16th Independent Brigade and Zhu Yaohua's 54th Brigade in Lianhua Anfu, they fled from the Jiangxi border into Hunan Province and surrounded the city on all four sides. County Magistrate Chen led a few trusted soldiers to break through the encirclement and escape, losing the county seal, which has been reported to the Civil Affairs Department for reissue. However, the garrison troops in Jiangxi Province are weak, and it is feared that the three counties cannot be recovered in a short time. (May 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Unprecedented Massacre in Shenyang <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Eight Family Members Killed; Murderer Still at Large</p>
<p>A dispatch from Shenyang reports that the massacre of seven members of Guo Chunsen's family on Avenue Edward VII in Shanghai has shocked the city. Now, in Shenyang, a similar tragedy has occurred. On the evening of the 9th of this month, eight members of Li Jingzhou's family in Lane 4 of Haoranli on Yiwei Road in the commercial district were killed, causing great concern for local security and social morale. The details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Location of the Incident: The location of the tragedy is collectively known as Houshengyuan. Li's residence is in Jiang Enzhi's house. There are three houses in the garden. A two-story building facing the entrance (with one side hidden) with a total of ten rooms, is occupied by the Jiang family. The ground floor is used for storage. Another small corner gate on the west side leads to a house with more than ten rooms, entirely occupied by the Jiang family. Another small corner gate on the east side leads to Li Jingzhou's house, with five Western-style main rooms from east to west. The first two rooms are the living quarters for his son and daughter-in-law. The third room is the living room. The fourth room is the living quarters for Li Jingzhou and his wife, concubines, and three daughters (elder, second, and youngest). The fifth room is the guest room. There are also two small east wing rooms, a south room for servants, and a north room for the kitchen. Outside the corner gate is a well. Li's main house leads to the street, and the wing rooms extend east to the backyard of the Sino-Japanese Joint Mining Company, and south to residential homes. This is a rough description of the house and the living quarters of the master and servants.</p>
<p>Household Members: The exact names of Li's household members and servants are unknown as some were not registered in the household register. Generally: (1) Head of household, Li Jingzhou, 54 years old, from Changtu County, friend of Chang Yinhuai, formerly served as the Longjiang Daoyin of Heilongjiang Province, Deputy Director and Secretary of the Former Law Enforcement Office, Tangshan Section Chief of the Jingfeng Railway, and other important positions. (2) His wife, Xia, 48 years old. (3) His son, Li Peiqin, 28 years old, formerly worked in politics, currently unemployed. (4) His son's concubine, Shang, 25 years old. (5) Eldest daughter, Laixi, 18 years old. (6) Second daughter, Laizhen, 13 years old. (7) Youngest daughter, Laiming, 6 years old. (8) Servant, Yu Zhikuan, 49 years old. (9) Servant, Lin Haiquan, 28 years old. (10) Xue Wencheng, 16 years old (This was stated by a close relative of his brother, as he had only been in Li's house for ten days, so he was not registered in the household register). There is also a Mr. You, who was also not registered. Li also has a concubine, Mrs. Mou, who is not in Shenyang (or said to have gone to Sipingjie with Li). As for his son and daughter-in-law, they seem to have divorced long ago, or it is said that she has died. Circumstances of the Massacre: Xue Wencheng and Yu Zhikuan both died on the kang in the wing room where Li lived. A name stamp of "Zhang Deyi" was found on Yu Zhikuan's waist, so it is unknown whether his surname is Zhang or Yu. However, there is no Zhang listed in the household register. It is unknown if it was changed recently, as the Jiang family across the courtyard does not know, and there is no way to inquire. The two were dressed and covered in quilts, with their heads severely injured by a heavy object. Brain matter splattered, and blood stained the bedding, a truly gruesome scene. The items in the room were messy, but the corners of the quilts were intact, as if they were asleep. Judging by the circumstances, the attack likely occurred between 10:00 PM and 11:00 PM on the 9th (as they usually went to bed between 11:00 PM and 12:00 AM). Li Peiqin and his concubine, Shang, both died in the easternmost room of the main house, on the kang, dressed and lying down. An opium set was placed next to their pillows, as if they were smoking. Their arms were separated, and their heads were each injured in five or six places, with bloodied heads and disfigured faces. The eldest daughter, Laixi, died on the ground in the middle hall, as if she was running outside when she was struck down. There were also several knife wounds, mostly on her back. Logically, it seems that she was running outside when she was struck down and killed from behind. She was wearing a white pants suit. The second daughter, Laizhen, died on the north kang in the west room (the room where Li usually lived), with her inner pants pulled down and her hands covering her face, as if she was afraid. She was struck down and died lying on her back, with blood staining her fingers and several knife wounds. The youngest daughter, Laiming, was struck and cut on her head and chest, and died beside her sister. Li Jingzhou's wife, Xia, died on the ground, as if she was struck and fell down, cut and killed. The servant Du Haiquan, listed in the household register, is missing. According to the reporter, the servant Mr. You is also missing.</p>
<p>Discovery of the Tragedy: A Mr. Shang, over 50 years old, wearing a blue cloth shirt, is the father of Li Peiqin's concubine. He lives in Nanguan. He went to Li's house on the 9th to deliver a block of soy paste, and all was well. At 3:15 PM on the afternoon of the 10th, he went to Li's house again. Upon entering the courtyard, he first went to the wing room and saw that the cook Yu Zhikuan and the servant Xue Wencheng were both dead in their quilts, covered in blood. He rushed to the main house to report, but upon pushing open the door, he saw Li's eldest daughter's corpse lying on the ground in a pool of blood. He rushed to her sister's room to the east, and found that she was also dead. He quickly ran out, notified the Jiang family in the same courtyard, and reported to the Xiaoxibianmen Outer Branch Office. The head of the office, Li Guofan, wired the Local Court and the 3rd Bureau. After receiving the report, Director Guo Zhanchun telegraphed all branches of the General Bureau, ordering all branch offices to pay close attention to facilitate the investigation of the murderer.</p>
<p>Arrival of the Military Police: At 3:30 PM that afternoon, all public security bureaus in the commercial district, led by their directors and over twenty police officers, successively rushed to the scene, prohibiting idlers from entering the courtyard. They placed Mr. Shang, who reported the incident, under police guard to await questioning. Shortly after, General Bureau Chief Bai, Chief Inspector Chang, Inspector Jiang, and the heads of the 4th and 6th Branches of the Provincial Capital, Wang Shanda and Chen Qingfu, as well as police officers from the 5th Branch, soldiers from the 7th Detachment of the Public Security Corps, and the Detective Team, also arrived at the scene to maintain order. At 6:00 PM, Local Court Prosecutors Long Xiang, Zhang Qinwu, and Liu Bingjian arrived at the scene with Coroner Hei Mingrui to conduct an examination.</p>
<p>Discovery of Murder Weapons: The police found a kitchen knife with fresh blood in the wing room, as well as an iron hammer weighing about six pounds, and over ten ropes. They also found gold tickets worth 321 yuan and 20.3 yuan in cash on the table in Li Peiqin's room (and several drops of blood were found at the entrance to the main house, but they suddenly disappeared halfway). All were taken by the prosecutors as evidence for future investigation.</p>
<p>Return of the Person in Charge: Li Jingzhou had taken his concubine to Sipingjie a month ago for business. After the incident occurred, his friend telegraphed him. Li took the Sitiao train back to Shenyang on the evening of the 10th. On the 11th, he bought eight coffins from the Yongxingde wood shop in Xiaobeiguan and hastily buried the deceased before bringing the remains to Shandong Temple for safekeeping. He then went to the 3rd Bureau to be questioned. The house is currently guarded by police from the 3rd Bureau. (May 12th)</p>

<p>Holding Street Fighting Exercises in Toudaogou</p>
<p>Two Divisions of Troops Stationed Along the South Manchurian Railway</p>
<p>A dispatch from Harbin reports that the 4th Company of the Japanese Garrison stationed in Changchun, numbering approximately 800 men, held combat exercises on the 5th of this month, when Lieutenant Colonel Koga Mineichi, an inspector from the Army Ministry, arrived in Changchun. The exercises involved cavalry scouting, infantry fighting, and artillery live-fire, lasting for four days, from the 5th to the afternoon of the 8th. On the first day, street fighting exercises were held in Toudaogou in the leased territory. For a time, pedestrians on the streets took cover, and only Japanese soldiers could be seen everywhere. The density of gunfire caused fear among passersby. On the second day, exercises to disrupt transportation were held between Gongzhuling and Changchun. On the third day, exercises for protecting transportation and offensive and defensive maneuvers were held. On the fourth day, defensive works were constructed, including setting up electric fences, telephones, and military telegraphs near the station. The exercises only stopped at midnight that day. Koga Mineichi praised the team's exercises and military bearing. Today, the Changchun Station was lifted from the lockdown, and passengers could pass through without hindrance. However, the people of Changchun have suffered from fear for four days. Regarding the Japanese army along the South Manchurian Railway, after the situation of the Sino-Russian problem eased, the 14th Division, which was stationed between Liaoyang Ning Changchun, has been transferred back to Pyongyang. According to recent investigations, the troops currently stationed in various locations are divided into eight major districts, and the types of troops are infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The main force, the 16th Division, numbers approximately 5,000 men, the garrison force numbers approximately 3,000 men, and the standing army numbers approximately 12,000 men. Except for the standing army, which is under the command of the Lushun Fortress Command, the garrison force is under the jurisdiction of the commander of the Japanese garrison in Gongzhuling, and the 16th Division is managed by the Japanese military command in Liaoyang City. These two armies are under the command of the Lushun Guanche Military Command. The eight major districts are as follows: 1st District: Liaoyang, stationed with 700 infantry, cavalry, and artillery from the 16th Division. The division headquarters is located here. 2nd District: Lianshan to Andong, stationed with the 4th Battalion of the Independent Garrison, 800 infantry. 3rd District: Yingkou to Haicheng, stationed with the 3rd Company of the Independent Garrison, 400 artillery. 4th District: Fushun to Shenyang, garrisoned by the 1st Battalion, 700 infantry. 5th District: Wanjialing to Wafangdian, stationed with the 3rd Battalion of the Independent Garrison, 800 infantry. 6th District: Liaoyang to Haicheng, stationed with the 2nd Battalion of the Independent Garrison, 1,200 infantry. 7th District: Changchun to Tieshanling, stationed with the 4th Independent Garrison Company, 1,000 infantry (800 of whom are stationed in Changchun Changchuan). 8th District: Lushun to Dalian, in addition to the fortress headquarters troops, stationed with the main force of the 16th Division, 1,500 men.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Flourishing Railway Construction in Eastern Provinces <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Zhutong Railway is 940 Li Long</p>
<p>Zhangjiu Railway is 80 Li Long</p>
<p>Huhaisuiwang Branch Line is in the Planning Stage</p>
<p>A dispatch from Harbin dated the 5th reports that the total length of railways in the Northeast, including those built by the state and foreigners, has exceeded twice the total length of railways in the country. However, the authorities and the public, feeling the pressure of Russian influence externally and the need for materials internally, are still planning and carrying out the construction of railways in various border areas. The plans that have been matured recently are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Zhutong Railway is located in Jilin Province. The entire line is 940 li long, and the construction is expected to take three years with a cost of 30 million yuan. It is jointly funded by officials and businessmen and organized by the Northeast Transportation Committee. The route passes through Zhuhe, Tongrong, Fangzheng, Yilan, Huachuan, Fujin, and ends at Tongjiang. It has been requested by the Northeast Transportation Committee to report to the Central Railway Department, and surveying can begin in June of this year. The Zhutong Railway Preparation Office has been established in Jilin Province to start preparations. The area through which this road passes is extremely rich in agricultural products, and there are many undeveloped wastelands. Once built, it will bring great benefits to the economy and national defense.</p>
<p>(2) The Zhangjiu Railway: This road is planned to start from Xiajiutai (a small station on the Jichang Railway) in Jilin and be laid to Zhangjiawan on the China Eastern Railway. The entire line is 80 li long. After discussions between Mr. Zhang Zuoxiang and the Northeast Transportation Committee, it was named the Zhangjiu Railway. The purpose of its construction is to cultivate a branch line of the Jihai Railway, absorb the freight traffic of the Jichang and China Eastern Railways, and avoid transportation through the South Manchurian Railway. The line is not long, and the project costs are not high, so it is easy to raise funds. Merchants and residents in nearby areas are hoping for the quick completion of this line. The outline of the design is: (1) The route from Xiajiutai to Zhangjiawan is 80 li long. (2) The construction cost is 3 million yuan. (3) All surveyors and workers will be transferred from the Jihai Railway. (4) The road will be open to traffic within four months and completed within six months after work begins. (5) All expenses will be borne by the Jilin Provincial Government, and it will be entirely a provincial railway. Surveying has already begun.</p>
<p>(3) Suiwang Branch Road: It is proposed to start from Suihua County, Donghuang, Heilongjiang, and be laid to Wangkui Road, as a branch line of the Huhuai Railway. The total length is 130 li, and the project cost is set at 1.3 million yuan. Merchants and residents on Wangkui Road will bear 600,000 yuan, and the remainder will be temporarily advanced by the Huhuai Railway Bureau, to be compensated when Wangkui collects land donations and housing taxes in the 20th year of the Republic of China. Currently, this matter has been reported by Wangkui County Magistrate Jing Guoru to the Heilongjiang Provincial Government and forwarded to the Northeast Transportation Committee, and is still under discussion. In the future, if approved, the Huhuai Line will be extended to Keshan next year to connect with the Qike Railway, which will further facilitate transportation in eastern Heilongjiang. Since the Qike Railway opened to Taianzhen, its business has been developing daily. Stations along the line, such as Taianzhen Yangjiatun, are grain-producing areas, exporting approximately 2,000 tons per day. The road has entered into joint transportation arrangements with the Taoang, Sitao, and Beining roads. The transportation of merchants' grain and goods on each road is directly linked, so when the entire line opens, its business will be even more developed. Currently, approximately 1,000 passengers travel to and from each day, with passenger ticket revenue of 1,300 yuan and freight transportation revenue of 1,300 yuan on behalf of other roads. The total daily revenue from other sporadic collections is approximately 7,000 yuan. The business revenue, offset by expenses, still leaves a surplus.</p>

<p>Citywide Rumors of Child Abduction   Recently, a rumor has suddenly spread in the community of our county, stating that a certain place is building a large bridge and needs a certain number of boys and girls, and that people have been sent out to capture them. It was also said that Cai's Elementary School had lost fourteen students. The rumor spread throughout the city, causing widespread panic. However, after investigation, there was absolutely no such thing. It is clear that malicious individuals were creating rumors and causing trouble. In order to stabilize public sentiment and strictly prohibit the spread of rumors, the County Government and the Public Security Bureau separately issued public notices yesterday to dispel the rumors. At the same time, the Education Bureau also instructed the principals of public and private schools to inform students not to lightly believe rumors and to focus on their studies.</p>
<p>Management Issues of Municipal Funds and Property   The Wuxi Municipal Preparatory Office was ordered to close down, and the office's various undertakings were handed over to the County Government's various bureaus. The County Government will also form a Municipal Funds and Property Management Committee in conjunction with local figures to manage municipal funds and property. It is learned that the Municipal Preparatory Office was originally scheduled to hand over on the 15th, but due to County Magistrate Sun going to Shanghai for medical treatment, it was decided to postpone the handover by five days. The Reorganization Committee of the County Party Headquarters believes that the Municipal Funds and Property Management Committee after the closure of the Municipal Preparatory Office should be composed of representatives from the Party Headquarters and people's organizations, and should not be controlled by a few special classes. Yesterday, Zhou Fengjing, a member of the Standing Committee of the Party Reorganization Committee, issued an official letter to the County Government stating his views and requesting that they be considered. At the same time, Zhao Zixin, Cai Jihui, Miao Erheng, and others from the First District also believe that the Municipal Funds and Property Committee should be organized by the First District Office in conjunction with impartial local figures, and that the word "District" should be added to the name of the Property Committee to indicate distinction. Therefore, they submitted the above proposal to the Sixth District Affairs Meeting for resolution, and immediately submitted the original proposal to the County Government for adoption and implementation. It is said that the County Government plans to study the various proposals for the Municipal Funds and Property Committee before considering and requesting instructions for handling. Also, Yang Hanxi and Zhou Jimei, residents of the First District, went to Zhenjiang yesterday (the 16th) morning to petition the Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs and Construction for the second time, requesting that the various affairs of the Preparatory Office be handed over to the First District Office for management.</p>
<p>Gloomy Cocoon Market   The silkworm market in Wuxi has reached the stage of major sleep and leaf opening, but due to the unfavorable weather and the impact of privately made inferior seeds, the official authorities have not added inspections. As a result, the results in the surrounding villages are extremely poor, with statistics showing only about 30%. Due to the sluggish silk sales and the sharp drop in market prices, cocoon merchants are becoming more pessimistic and are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Those who are preparing to collect cocoons, given the unrest caused by bandits, are sending telegrams to the County Government and the Water Police District for protection.</p>

It had been encroached upon by Ji Xisan and others who refused to vacate. The other day, the entire association issued flyers to resign. County Magistrate Li read the flyers and, because the matter concerned fire prevention for the entire city, specially ordered Wei Buchan, the district chief of the First District, to investigate and mediate, and summoned Sha Shaoshan of the Joint Association to the government office to explain the importance of the matter. Regarding the encroachment of public land by the Ji family, he ordered that it be handled according to legal procedures and that they not resign.</p>

<p>Strange News of Impersonating the Chief of the Public Security Bureau   A man named Xu Jingzhi, approximately thirty years old, arrived in Zhenjiang last month with Tan Houcheng and Wu Jingming. They stayed at the Da'an Inn on Rixin Street. Xu claimed to be the newly appointed Chief of the Taixing Public Security Bureau, Tan was said to be an aide-de-camp to the Commander-in-Chief of the Nanjing Army, Navy, and Air Force, and Wu was said to be a staff member of the Public Security Bureau. They appeared to be officials preparing to take office. Xu entered the city the other day in the afternoon and went to the Department of Civil Affairs to seek an audience with Director Hu. Director Hu asked his purpose, and Xu said that he was ordered by Commander-in-Chief Chiang to come to Zhenjiang and would be going to take office at the Taixing Public Security Bureau. Director Hu was astonished to hear this, saying that the Chiefs of the Public Security Bureaus of various counties were always appointed by the Department of Civil Affairs and that the Headquarters had never sent anyone, nor had it notified the Department. He asked if he had any official documents from the Headquarters, and Xu immediately produced a document for Hu to see. The gist of the document was that so-and-so was appointed as the Chief of the Public Security Bureau of such-and-such county and was ordered to proceed to take office. The end was stamped with the seal of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, but there was no supervisor's seal and no proofreading. It was clearly forged. When asked where the document came from, Xu replied that he got it from Tan Houcheng, the aide-de-camp at Headquarters. When asked where Tan was, Xu replied that he came to Zhenjiang with him and was currently staying at the Da'an Inn. After inquiring, Director Hu was extremely surprised and sent Squad Leader Hui of the Provincial Guard with six provincial guards to the Da'an Inn with Xu Jingzhi. Sure enough, there was a person named Tan Houcheng, who was arrested along with Wu Jingming and taken to the Provincial Public Security Bureau. Director Chen interrogated them one by one, and they confessed at length. The general idea was that Xu was obsessed with being an official and was deceived by Tan. The document was given to Xu by Tan, and Tan got it from someone else. The whole thing was repeatedly fabricated and extremely absurd. Someone from Nanjing came today to investigate the matter. It is said that Tan's position as aide-de-camp was also a past fact. Director Chen, because the case involved impersonating an official and forging documents, was not in a position to handle it and has submitted the original confession to the Department of Civil Affairs for review.</p>
<p>County Magistrate of Jintan Accused   Yang Zhen, the County Magistrate of Jintan, has been accused of corruption and perversion of justice since taking office last October, and his reputation is terrible.

<p>Keio University Students Attend Track and Field Competition</p>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) The Japan Sports Association held a preparatory committee meeting at 6:00 PM on the 12th of this month in the Tokyo office to discuss the issue of university participation in this session of the Far Eastern Games. Previously, the Japan Sports Association had a misunderstanding with the Keio University track and field athletes, so the Keio athletes declared that they would not participate in this conference. Now, both parties have communicated, and people have explained the situation in the middle. If Keio refuses to participate, Japan will lose its elite. Therefore, the Japan Sports Association expressed its deep apologies and decided to request the school to participate because the school's athletes are the best in Japan and are also admired by people across the country. The Japan Sports Association has recently sought the school's consent and has received a reply stating that it will send seven track and field athletes to participate. The names of the athletes and the events they will participate in are as follows: Masaji Kitamoto (10,000 meters, 1,500 meters), Kiyoshi Tsuda (High Jump), Osamu Ono (Discus Throw), Masajiro Itabashi (Shot Put, Discus Throw), Shin-ei Saito (Javelin Throw), Iwao Abu (100 meters, 200 meters), and Sadaji Yamamoto (Javelin).</p>

<p>The Central Asian Survey Team of the American Museum of Natural History in New York had planned to continue excavating ancient animal specimens in Mongolia last year. After repeated negotiations with the Antiquities Preservation Committee on the conditions, the team leader Andes regretted his previous proposal, and the two sides stopped the process.

In February of this year, a joint meeting was held, and Osters proved that Andes was commissioned as a representative in the American Science Magazine to publish texts, correcting the previous mistakes, and stating that this trip to Mongolia would be the last time. In the future, the publications and public statements of the Museum of Natural History would no longer contain insulting Chinese words. Therefore, in March, the Antiquities Preservation Committee appointed Ma Heng, director of the Beijing branch, as a representative to sign with Andes in Tuancheng. According to Article 5 of the agreement, "This agreement shall take effect after being approved by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China."

Those that are different from those previously collected and must be transported to the United States for research may be transported to the United States in moderation, subject to the following conditions: (1) China should send specialized scholars to work together, and all travel expenses and expenses during the research period will be borne by the Museum of Natural History. (2) The American Museum of Natural History should provide the Chinese scholars with the convenience of independent research.

<h3 id="e118">Shanghai Schools Support the Recovery of Concession Educational Rights <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The principals of eleven schools, including Shanghai Special Municipality Qin Yi School, jointly sent a letter to the Chinese members of the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting assistance in recovering educational rights in the concessions. The letter stated: "To the esteemed Chinese members of the Shanghai Municipal Council, we have read the declaration of the Shanghai Special Municipality Education Bureau on recovering educational rights in the concessions, and have also read the telegrams and letters from all sectors regarding the recovery of educational rights in the Shanghai Special Zone. The arguments are unanimous and heartfelt, and the enthusiasm and determination are admirable. At this time of political tutelage, this proposition is crucial and cannot be delayed. Although our schools are not located in the concessions, we are affiliated with the city's educational services. We feel threatened by the loss of educational rights in the concessions and cannot remain silent. We must speak out. The existence of concessions in our country is a result of unequal treaties. However, concessions are not the same as ceded territories; they are merely residences for foreigners within a certain period. The sovereignty of the owner has not completely disappeared. After reviewing all unequal treaties, there is no special privilege for foreigners to monopolize education. This is an overreach that cannot be justified. This is the first reason why we are eager to recover educational rights in the concessions. The citizens and children in the concessions are mostly educated in an imperialistic manner. Foreigners are anesthetizing our youth, preventing students from enjoying the education of the Three Principles of the People, which is heartbreaking. This is the second reason why we are eager to recover educational rights in the concessions. Before the abolition of unequal treaties and the recovery of concessions, the Shanghai Education Bureau is actively carrying out the movement to recover educational rights in the concessions, preparing for new construction in special zone education, adding as many municipal schools as possible, implementing pre-determined plans, adapting to needs, and refusing to allow concession citizens to be long fooled by the imperialist invasion policy. They are determined to rectify and unify the exclusive educational rights. People share the same mind and reason, so the recovery of educational rights in the concessions is the precursor to the abolition of all unequal treaties and the recovery of concessions. This is the third reason why we are eager to recover educational rights in the concessions. Looking at the four municipal schools in the concessions, new students always lament their lack of opportunities at the beginning of the school year, showing a great scramble. This shows that the enlightened citizens in the concessions, those with spirit, are unwilling to let their children receive a Western slave education and become their tools. Based on the psychology of the citizens, they all yearn for our country's education authorities to recover the monopoly. This is the fourth reason why we are eager to recover educational rights in the concessions. There are many private schools in the concessions that are well-managed, but it is inevitable that some use the name of running a school to make money, even opening two or three pigeon-hole-sized rooms with a school sign hanging outside. The content is not systematic, and in reality, they are gathering places for reactionaries to plot out of bounds, using the concession as a shield. Our country's education authorities have no right to intervene, which is hateful. This is the fifth reason why we are eager to recover educational rights in the concessions. In summary, if we do not recover educational rights in the concessions in the shortest possible time, Shanghai education will forever be a deformed form, not unified and complete. It is the greatest shame in our country's educational history. The esteemed members have high virtue and prestige. This time, being elected as Chinese members is deeply gratifying. We are pleased that the esteemed members are taking office and hope that they will uphold the spirit of fearlessness, urge the Shanghai Municipal Council to wake up as soon as possible, and assist the Municipal Education Bureau in recovering Shanghai's education. The others will sing praises and offer heartfelt prayers to the esteemed members. Yao Wen and others are weak and have little influence, and their words are insignificant. We do not overestimate our ignorance and humbly present our words. We hope you will not disregard them and will carefully consider and await clear instructions. Respectfully wishing you well, Cui Yaowen, principal of Shanghai Special Municipality Qin Yi Elementary School, Huang Junbao of Donggou Elementary School, Sun Shixian, principal of Zhuyin Elementary School, Qu Mingshan, principal of Peiying Elementary School, Gu Zuyu, principal of Zhendong Elementary School, Qu Zhixu, principal of Gaohang Elementary School, Shi Weisheng, principal of Xigou Elementary School, Huang Zuocai, principal of Jingcheng Elementary School, Jin Ming, principal of Wandou Elementary School, Gu Shiqi, principal of Yincun Elementary School, Song Renying, principal of Guangxin Elementary School."</p>
<p>In addition, the Gaohang Education Association and Shanghai Kindergarten Normal School, West District Elementary School, Qinghua Middle and Elementary School, Yucai Middle School, Minfu School, Zhengmeng School, Yafeng Elementary School, Tongcen Elementary School, Wuben East Elementary School, Guocui First Public School, Shangzhi Elementary School, Zhenyuan Elementary School, Qiming Elementary School, Qunyi Girls' School, Doumiye School, Wuxing Middle School, Nanyang Girls' Middle School, Shangde First Elementary School, Shangde Second Elementary School, Shangde Middle School, Fushan School, Yinlou Elementary School, Yafeng School, Huhai School, Yangci Charity School, Youth Middle School, Shanghai Primary Elementary School, Minghui School, North Shanghai Public School, Yangmeng School, and Minli Girls' Middle School, also issued declarations yesterday to support the recovery of educational rights in the concessions.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Private Secondary Schools and Above Abolish Honorary Principals <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Chen Dewei, Director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Education Bureau, previously requested the Ministry of Education to abolish honorary principals in private secondary schools and above because many of them were irresponsible, leading to the inducement of young people. On the 15th, the Ministry of Education issued an order to all provinces and cities, stating: "According to the report from the Shanghai Special Municipality Education Bureau, some private schools in this city hire social celebrities and contemporary figures to serve as honorary principals. In reality, they never consult on any school affairs. Those who serve as honorary principals are enthusiastic about education and are willing to lend their names to show their support. However, those in charge of school affairs often use their prestige to gain social trust. Therefore, when disputes occur in schools, no one is responsible, making it difficult to handle the matter. The direct victims are the students. The Ministry of Education believes that the system of honorary principals who do not ask about school matters and are not responsible should be abolished to prevent young people from being deceived and to prevent a few scholars from using names to deceive. After investigation, the points raised in the original report are not only true for schools in Shanghai, but also common in other places. In the future, no matter where private secondary schools and above are located, if there is an honorary principal, the position should be abolished to prevent borrowing the name. This order is hereby issued and distributed to all concerned parties and private secondary schools and above in the jurisdiction to comply. This order is hereby issued."</p>

<h3 id="e125">Wang Rongbao Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Returning to His Post in Tokyo in Three Weeks</p>
<p>Wang Rongbao, the ambassador to Japan, returned to China on the Chichibu Maru mail ship and arrived in Shanghai at 2 PM yesterday. He is staying at the Wengzhou Hotel on Lafayette Road. He is scheduled to go to Beijing within days to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on his work in Japan over the past year. Ambassador Wang's return to China is a routine matter once a year and has no special mission. After completing his official duties in Beijing, Wang plans to return to his native Suzhou. He is expected to stay in China for three weeks before returning to his post in Tokyo. There have been rumors that Japan will send troops to China again during the civil war in North and South China. This reporter asked Ambassador Wang about this yesterday. Wang replied that the Japanese government has no such intention. However, there are 300 Japanese soldiers stationed in Tianjin who are now due for rotation, so there has been some slight movement. This has nothing to do with the situation in China. The Japanese government and public opinion both hope that the civil war in China will end soon. The ship on which Ambassador Wang Rongbao returned to China was the Chichibu Maru, a new ship of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company. It arrived in Shanghai on its maiden voyage. It will sail to Hong Kong tomorrow. Because the Chinese ambassador was on board, in accordance with international etiquette, the Chinese flag was hoisted high on the mast of the ship to show respect. Before the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, it was customary to hoist the Chinese flag every time the Chinese ambassador traveled on a foreign mail ship to show respect. After the Boxer Rebellion, this ceremony had long been abandoned. This time, the Chichibu Maru took the opportunity of its maiden voyage to Shanghai, and Ambassador Wang happened to be on board, so it restored the old international etiquette, which is also worthy of commemoration.</p>
<p>Ambassador Wang Rongbao Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>A reporter from the Zhendan News Agency asked Wang yesterday about the mission of his return to China. Wang said, "(1) There are two or three thousand overseas Chinese in Tokyo. Overseas Chinese affairs are managed by the embassy and are quite complicated. If China were to establish a consulate in Tokyo at this time, it would be difficult to raise funds. It is planned to move the Yokohama consulate to Tokyo, but according to the Yokohama consul, although the number of overseas Chinese in Yokohama is not as large as in Tokyo, the assets of overseas Chinese in Yokohama are many times greater than in Tokyo. It is now planned to suggest to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that an office of the Yokohama consulate be established in Tokyo. (2) To discuss Sino-Japanese cultural affairs. Because the Ministry of Education advocates the recovery of the Japanese Boxer Indemnity, after arriving in Beijing this time, I will contact all parties concerned to negotiate the Japanese refund of the Boxer Indemnity and its use. (3) There is no limit to the number of overseas Chinese going to Japan, and they are often sent back to China by the Japanese authorities, and there is no right to negotiate. It is planned to ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to formulate appropriate measures." In addition, in a conversation at the Wengzhou Hotel yesterday afternoon, he said, "Since the signing of the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement, the Japanese government and public opinion have a very good feeling towards our country. However, another group of people expressed dissatisfaction with Shidehara, calling his diplomacy 'diplomacy of inaction' and 'weak diplomacy.' As for the appointment of Shigemitsu as ambassador, I have not heard anything. Recently, our overseas Chinese are often prevented from returning to China. I am planning to contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to find a solution. Because in Japan, those with knowledge and assets who go to their country are of course welcome, but those who are destitute and have no knowledge or skills become undesirable elements, which Japan strongly opposes. In my opinion, there is almost no way to negotiate this matter. It is now decided to discuss a solution with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, so that in the future, Chinese workers and others who go to Japan must have legitimate purposes and the ability to maintain their livelihoods, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or a relevant authority will issue them a certificate of departure and notify the Japanese side to allow them to land. This may be possible, and it is also a matter of our country's dignity."</p>

<p>Zhang Weihan Will Depart for Yunnan Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Sino-French-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty, which has been under contention for more than a year, was recently finalized after the French envoy Martel arrived in Shanghai and met with Foreign Minister Wang. After days of back-and-forth telegrams, the text of the treaty was drafted. The morning before, Foreign Minister Wang sent Hu Shize, Director of the Asian Department, to Shanghai to meet with Zhang Weihan, the representative of Yunnan, and French envoy Martel for the final consultation. It was decided that the treaty would be formally signed last night at the Nanjing Foreign Affairs Office. French envoy Martel and Zhang Weihan arrived in Beijing yesterday morning. It is also reported that Zhang has already purchased a cabin on the Chichibu Maru, the new Japanese ship making its maiden voyage to Shanghai. After the signing of the treaty, he will return to Shanghai to board the ship, which is scheduled to sail at 10 AM on the 18th at the Huishan Wharf.

<p>Regarding the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department overstepping its authority to reorganize the Businessmen's Association, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday telegraphed to the Central Party Department in Nanjing, the Executive Yuan of the National Government, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating, "We have received a letter from the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce stating that on the 8th of this month (May), we received Instruction No. 148 from the Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee, which stated, 'For compliance, the unified measures for merchant organizations in Zhejiang Province have been issued and implemented by this association, and Wang Zhuzhai, Jin Runquan, and 19 others have been appointed as members of the Zhejiang Provincial Merchant Organization Unification Committee. All merchant groups within the province must immediately cease activities. Therefore, in addition to separate orders, this order is issued to instruct the association to comply, promptly prepare for the conclusion and handover, and await the Provincial Party Unification Committee to receive and handle it.' Upon receiving this order, we immediately convened an executive meeting at 5:00 PM on the 10th of this month and resolved to comply with the Party's order. We also resolved to cease work from the 12th of the same month and await the Provincial Merchant Organization Unification Committee to take over. In addition to submitting reports to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, the Department of Construction of Zhejiang Province, and the Executive Committee of Zhejiang Province, we hereby inform you for your reference.' We have found that the establishment of Provincial Federations of Chambers of Commerce is stipulated in Article 37 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, and the reorganization and responsibility for reorganization are stipulated in Article 42 of the Chamber of Commerce Law and Article 19 of the detailed rules. This instruction from the Executive Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department not only infringes upon administrative authority but also alters national laws with a provincial Party order, which may obstruct the future of commercial activities. Therefore, we hereby send a telegram to request investigation and correction, and we hope to receive a reply for compliance. Respectfully, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, Standing Committee Members Su Minsheng, Zhang Yuquan, Lu Guangji, Chen Riping, Li Kuian, Peng Chuli, etc. (with seal)."</p>
<h3 id="e128">Yesterday, Five Million Gold Coins Were Not Allowed to Be Exported <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Reported by the Shanghai Branch of Sumitomo Bank</p>
<p>Intended for Shipment to the United States</p>
<p>Since the rise of gold and the cheapness of silver, large amounts of American silver have been continuously imported into Shanghai. However, the gold coins in Shanghai have been massively purchased and shipped to the United States, and the number has been enormous in the past two months. As a result, the gold coins remaining in Shanghai are only about one-tenth of what they used to be, which will affect the market. Yesterday, a huge amount of gold coins was discovered being prepared for shipment to the United States by customs, and the export was prohibited. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Prohibits Gold Export: In view of the continuous export of gold coins from Shanghai, with each export amounting to 700,000 to 800,000 yuan, the Ministry of Finance, fearing that it would trigger a financial crisis, ordered the Jianghai Customs to prohibit the declaration and export of gold coins. After receiving the order, the Jianghai Customs issued a notice and informed the local shipping companies that they were not allowed to accept gold coins for shipment to ports in various countries after the ban was issued.</p>
<p>Sumitomo's Shipment Refused: After the ban was issued, the Shanghai branch of Sumitomo Bank suddenly had a large batch of gold coins, amounting to five million yuan (US dollars), yesterday. Because it urgently needed to be shipped to the United States, it intended to declare it for export on the Jackson ship through the American-owned Dalae Bank. All the procedures had been completed, but when it went to collect the bill of lading, it was refused by Dalae, citing the strict ban of the National Government, which made it difficult to handle the shipment. The coins were returned, and as a result, they could not be exported.</p>
<p>Dalae's Freight Loss: The freight for shipping gold from Shanghai to the United States is US$2.5 per thousand yuan. Before the ban was issued in the past two months, the bank's postal ships were used for gold shipments to the United States. Yesterday's refusal to ship the gold coins resulted in a loss of over US$10,000 in freight.</p>

Foreign goods merchants, who had planned to slightly increase prices due to the sharp rise the previous day, were caught off guard by the sudden decline. In the afternoon, the price slightly rebounded to 508 taels.</p>

<p>To Suppress Pirates</p>
<p>Pirates outside the Wusongkou have become increasingly rampant recently. The people of Haimen, Qidong, and Chongming counties, in view of the weakness of the water police force, jointly raised funds to build two warships to be allocated to the water police for dispatch and to strengthen the force. The people of the three counties jointly elected Gu Nanqun, Dong Diqing, and Mao Liru as members of the preparatory committee to formulate a plan, which was submitted to Zhu Bingzheng, the district chief of the 4th district of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Corps in Wusong, and forwarded to the Civil Affairs Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government for review. The Provincial Department approved the plan and immediately ordered the Maocheng Machinery Factory in Nanshi, Shanghai, to build the ships. It is now learned that the two warships have been rushed to completion. The cost of each ship is 30,000 yuan. All the equipment, such as rapid-firing guns, machine guns, and steel plates, is in place. The two ships are named "Zhen Dong" and "Zhen Hai." Yesterday, the Maocheng Factory tested the ships, and the results were excellent. The three members, Gu, Dong, and Mao, have submitted a report to the 4th district of the Provincial Water Police Corps and the governments of the three counties, Hai, Qidong, and Chongming, to schedule a joint inspection at the factory and report to the Provincial Department for record.</p>

The negotiating representatives reported on the two negotiations with the police station and the company in the past two days, saying that there were still no results. The capitalists still firmly refused to accept the lowest conditions, such as a uniform wage increase of three yuan for the copper workers, wages during the strike, the release of arrested workers, no dismissal of workers, double wages for Sunday work, and the restoration of jobs for unemployed workers. The crowd at the meeting was extremely indignant and unanimously resolved not to resume work without meeting the lowest conditions. They shouted slogans and paraded around Dalian Bay.</p>
<h3 id="e141">The Understanding and Efforts That Should Be Had to Commemorate May 18th <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>A. The Revolutionary Spirit of Mr. Chen Qimei:</p>
<p>1. Mr. Chen Was a Revolutionary Full of Compromise-Free Spirit: When the Provisional Government of Nanjing Was Established and the Qing Court Sent Representatives South to Negotiate Peace, Mr. Chen Vigorously Opposed the Peace Negotiation Proposition, Insisting on Upholding the Spirit of Non-Compromise and Taking Advantage of This Opportunity to Thoroughly Eliminate the Remnants of the Imperial System, so as to Avoid Endangering the Future. Within the Party, Mr. Chen Especially Advocated Eliminating Evil Thoroughly, Once Saying That to Avoid Defeating the Group, the Harmful Horse Must Be Removed; to Achieve a Change, Changing the String is Valuable. When Dr. Sun Yat-sen Reorganized the Chinese Revolutionary Party After the Failure of the Second Revolution to Concentrate Revolutionary Forces, Mr. Chen Was the Most Powerful.</p>
<p>2. Mr. Chen Was a Revolutionary Who Was Brave to Follow Good Advice and Correct His Mistakes: Since the Assassination of Song Jiaoren and the Failure of the Second Revolution, Mr. Chen Reviewed the Past Failures, All of Which Stemmed From Party Members Not Believing in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Propositions. Therefore, Mr. Chen Advocated That Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Words and Deeds Must Be Absolutely Obeyed, and Mr. Chen Personally Was From Beginning to End an Implementer of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>3. Mr. Chen Was a Revolutionary Who Was Brave in Sacrifice and Most Resilient and Unyielding: He Only Knew That There Was a Party and a Country, and Did Not Know What His Own Life and Death Were Worth. After the Failure of the Guangzhou Uprising on March 29th, the Authorities Were Still in Strict Alert and Search. Mr. Chen Dared to Enter and Exit Alone to Inquire About Military Intelligence. When Shanghai Became Independent in the Year of Xinhai, Mr. Chen Bravely Rushed Forward and Entered the Manufacturing Bureau to Persuade the Soldiers With His Principles, Which Enabled Him to Succeed.</p>
<p>B. The Revolutionary Achievements of Mr. Chen Qimei:</p>
<p>1. Mr. Chen Was a Revolutionary Pioneer Who Created the Republic of China: The Wuchang Uprising of Xinhai Revolution Had Revolutionary Foundation, but Still Could Not Be Regarded as Solid. When Mr. Chen Launched an Uprising in Shanghai in Response, Connecting Jiangsu and Zhejiang to Join Forces in Nanjing, the Qing Court Was Greatly Shocked, and Finally Eliminated the Feudal Autocratic Imperial System That Had Lasted for Thousands of Years and Established the Foundation of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>2. Mr. Chen Was the First to Uphold the Republic of China and Punish Yuan Shikai: When Yuan Shikai Declared Himself Emperor, the Party Decided to Punish Him. However, At That Time, the Rebel Atmosphere Was Rampant, and All Parties Had Extremely Strict Deployments. Shanghai Had a Heavy Garrison. At That Time, Mr. Chen Was Ordered to Punish Yuan. He Did Not Hesitate to Endure Hardships. He First Launched an Uprising in Shanghai, Sending People to Assassinate Zheng Rucheng, the Garrison Commander, and Secretly Ordered the Zhaohao Warship to Launch an Uprising to Promote the Union of Revolutionary Forces in the Southwest, Which Finally Overthrew Yuan Shikai.</p>
<p>C. The Significance of Commemorating Mr. Chen Qimei: Commemorating Mr. Chen Means Emulating His Spirit of Obeying, Obeying Dr. Sun Yat-sen and Abiding by Party Discipline, Emulating His Virtue of Being Brave in Moving to the Good and Correcting Mistakes, and Continuing His Will of Brave Sacrifice, Resilience, and Perseverance.</p>
<p>Attached Slogans and Slogans:</p>
<p>1. Mr. Chen Qimei Was a Loyal Disciple of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.</p>
<p>2. Continue Mr. Chen's Spirit of Non-Compromise.</p>
<p>3. Continue Mr. Chen's Spirit of Loyalty, Bravery, Depth, Determination, Perseverance, and Decisiveness.</p>
<p>4. Continue Mr. Chen's Spirit of Being Brave to Follow Good Advice and Correct Mistakes.</p>
<p>5. Commemorating Mr. Chen Means Sacrificing the Individual and Obeying the Party and the Country.</p>
<p>6. Commemorating Mr. Chen Means Eliminating All Reactionary Forces.</p>
<p>7. The Spirit of Mr. Chen Qimei Is Immortal.</p>
<p>8. Long Live the Kuomintang of China.</p>

<p>To Be Kind and Humble to Customers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, in order to promote business development, has specially issued instructions to postal savings and remittance personnel in various places, requiring them to be kind and humble to customers. The document states: "The postal savings and remittance business is commercial in nature and is very close to the general public. All staff members in the bureau must be kind, humble, sincere, and thorough to customers. Only then can the public feel convenient, and the business can develop. However, it has been found that among the postal bureaus' savings and remittance staff, there are many who are humble and sincere, but there are also some who are simple, arrogant, and disrespectful. In this situation, not only is it difficult to expand the business and the country suffers endless losses, but the people feel difficulty and society loses the convenience of circulation, which is contrary to the government's intention to reward and encourage savings. Therefore, it is hereby instructed to the various bureaus to instruct their savings and remittance personnel that from now on, they must be humble and sincere to savings and remittance customers and must not be arrogant and disrespectful. The heads of the various bureaus have the responsibility of supervising and inspecting, and they should always check and earnestly handle the matter in order to value their duties."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government received a message from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday, stating: "For the purpose of consultation, Article 6 of the National Uniform Measurement Procedure stipulates that each province, region, and special municipal government should formulate a uniform measurement procedure for the province, region, or special city within six months from the date of implementation of the measurement law and submit it to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for review and record. As the Ministry previously ordered that the statutory implementation of the measurement system would be on January 1st of this year, and requested that the city's uniform measurement procedure be formulated and submitted to the Ministry as soon as possible for assessment and record, now that the six-month period is about to expire, the uniform procedures for most provinces and cities have not yet been submitted. It is requested that the previous consultation be reviewed and the project procedure be formulated and sent to the Ministry as soon as possible for review and approval."</p>

<p>In order to rectify the city's water supply, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is handling the registration of self-provided water supply equipment for homeowners. The total number of registered items has now reached 360. Strict measures will be taken against those who fail to register to rectify the situation. It was recently discovered that the self-flowing well drilled by the National Sugar Manufacturing Company on Taixing Road in Wusong had not been registered. After repeated urging, the company refused to comply. Finally, on April 26th, a warning letter was sent, giving them seven days to complete the registration procedures. The company still ignored the warning. It was learned yesterday that the bureau has sent staff to temporarily seal off the water supply equipment as a warning to those who do not comply with the law.</p>

<p>The remains of the martyrs who died in the May 30th Incident are planned and managed by the Board of Directors of the May 30th Public Cemetery. More than ten acres of land were purchased at Fangjia Wooden Bridge at the end of Baoxing Road in Zhabei to build a public cemetery for burial, to commemorate their admiration and make them immortal. Yesterday, Wang Zhou, a relative of Wang Kuibao from Changshu, sent a letter to the relatives' association, saying: "Representatives Hu and Chen, my son Wang Kuibao was a car driver during his lifetime. On May 30th, 1925, he participated in the patriotic movement and died for his country at the age of 30. His remains are still temporarily placed in the Tianxia Guild Hall in Zhabei for five years. Although the condolence money of 2,000 yuan has been received, it has slightly eased the injustice. I don't know when the compensation will be resolved, but I have learned that many of the May 30th martyrs are buried in the May 30th Public Cemetery, which is eternal. Because I am an ignorant woman, I temporarily placed him in the Guild Hall, but it is not enough to comfort his heroic soul in the afterlife. Therefore, I have decided to rebury him in the Public Cemetery to comfort his spirit. However, I am an ignorant woman and do not know the reburial procedures. I would like to ask the two representatives to consult with the directors of the May 30th Public Cemetery Association to allow him to be reburied in the Public Cemetery before the 30th of this month, and please inform me of the reburial procedures so that I can follow them. I will be extremely grateful."</p>

<p>The Public Utilities Bureau Urges Implementation</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau believes that it is more economical to purchase electricity from large power plants and resell it than for water and electricity plants to generate their own electricity. The first step in its plan to unify the city's power plants is this regulation. In recent years, it has followed this step and made considerable progress. The Zhenru and Xianghua Electric Companies have successively stopped generating electricity and purchase electricity from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company for resale. The Pudong Electric Company has also signed a power supply contract with the China Electric Company and will soon implement it with the China Electric Company's power supply. In addition, there is also the Baoming Electric Company, which is very close to the site of the Zhabei New Power Plant, which is about to be completed and generate electricity. In view of the fact that the company's load has increased recently and the original equipment is insufficient, the Public Utilities Bureau believes that it would be better to stop generating electricity and purchase electricity from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, as the other companies have done. Moreover, the distance is very close, and the line equipment is even simpler. Cooperation between the two parties is beneficial without harm, and the first step in the bureau's plan to unify power plants can be completed. Therefore, it ordered the company to quickly negotiate with the Zhabei Company on power supply methods. It is said that the two companies have negotiated several times on this matter and it is imperative. It should be realized soon.</p>

It is now estimated that only 15 counties, including Zhenjiang, have reported, and 46 counties, including Jiangning, have not reported, which is very inappropriate. In addition to separate orders to urge them, we hereby order you, the county head, to investigate and report the registration situation and the date of implementation of the registration in your county within three days of receiving this document for assessment. The matter is important, so do not delay and incur blame." After receiving the order, County Head Wu issued an order to the district chiefs of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th districts yesterday, ordering them to comply and report the situation immediately upon receipt of the telegram.</p>

<p>The funding for the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau has been delayed for a long time. Former County Head Leng once proposed changing the bureau to a section, but there was no concrete solution after the meeting. It is now heard that the public opinion in the county generally advocates maintaining the status quo. Shanghai is a major commercial port and the focus of attention at home and abroad. Moreover, there are frequent reports of bandits and police in the area. Although public security matters cannot be expanded as much as possible due to financial difficulties, it is also inappropriate to reduce the scope. It is hoped that the funding for public security will be resolved and determined as soon as possible. Since County Head Yan took office, Public Security Bureau Chief Shen immediately met with him to report on the current situation of the bureau and the hardships of the officials and police. In the past, they could still borrow from stores or pawn and borrow money, but now the arrears are huge and they have exhausted all means. Therefore, they requested the county head to try to find a way to allocate funds from the provincial government and the Ministry of Finance to maintain public security.</p>

<p>Supporting the Market Strike by Tianjin Merchants</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Executive Committee sent a telegram to the entire nation, forwarded by all newspapers to the attention of all compatriots: The rebels are creating chaos and attempting to subvert the central government and undermine unity. They disregard the fact that military expenditures have no source and resort to rampant taxation, using every means possible. Recently, they have illegally imposed excessive taxes on machine-made Western-style goods in Tianjin, sacrificing the lifeline of domestic products and draining the merchants' wealth. This has aroused fierce opposition from the merchants of Tianjin, leading to an expanded market strike that will not end until the goal is achieved. Compatriots across the country, thinking of the Tianjin merchants, how should we empathize with their plight of being in dire straits? We must stop the originators of excessive taxation and violent levies. We should vigorously support the revolutionary action of the Tianjin merchants' market strike and directly resist, hoping to slightly maintain the lifeline of domestic products and save the oppressed and exploited merchants in Tianjin from being slaughtered and killed by the warlords. Our committee, leading the masses, has an unshirkable responsibility. We are outraged and vow to eliminate these villains. We hope that compatriots across the country will quickly rise up and plan for it. The Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Gold High, Silver Low: Pitle Merchants Hit Hard <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Jia Nong Unable to Pay for Goods</p>
<p>Longmao and Other Foreign Firms File Lawsuits to Recover Losses</p>
<p>Since the phenomenon of gold being expensive and silver being cheap occurred, general import merchants of Pitle (piece goods) have been greatly affected. When they ordered goods from foreign firms, the price of gold had not risen. But when the goods arrived, the price of gold soared, and the interest rate increased accordingly. As a result, the price of goods also increased, and many foreign firms were unable to pay for the goods. Some even ran aground. For example, Jia Nong Foreign Goods Firm previously ordered various piece goods from British firms such as Longmao and Ruikang. Because they were unable to take delivery, they were separately represented by lawyers such as Shen Yuesheng and Jiang Baolian to file lawsuits for damages. The goods ordered by the firm from Longmao included twenty boxes of silk gauze, ten boxes of fancy wool, and thirty boxes of bleached cloth. When the goods arrived in Shanghai, Jia Nong was unable to fulfill the order, and Longmao also paid the customs duties. Now, except for twenty-five boxes of bleached cloth, the remaining goods have been gradually sold by Longmao on its behalf, resulting in a total loss of 5,413 taels, one mace, and one fen of silver. They requested the court to order the owner of the firm, Cheng Jianong and Qin Tingsheng, to repay the money and order them to take the remaining twenty-five boxes of bleached cloth upon payment. As for the goods ordered from Ruikang, there were as many as ninety-five boxes of bi ji and fu chou (types of silk). After Ruikang sold them on its behalf, it suffered a loss of 4,411 taels, two mace, and four fen of silver, and also requested that Cheng Jianong be ordered to repay the money. These two cases were heard by Judge Xu Wenrong yesterday morning. The defendant Cheng Jianong was not present. First, the case filed by Longmao was heard. The plaintiff's lawyer, Shen Yuesheng, stated the type of goods ordered, the actual amount of the loss, and presented evidence such as the order form. In court, Cheng Jianong denied being the owner of Jia Nong Firm. Since there was a question about the subject of the lawsuit, the court ordered the plaintiff to provide evidence. Shen said that the name of the firm was Jia Nong, and Cheng Jianong must have a relationship with it. Also, Cheng's restaurants on Jiangxi Road and the iron factory in Hongkou are all named Jia Nong. The foreign goods firm is actually opened by Cheng. Cheng's lawyer strongly denied it. Shen requested a postponement to gather more evidence and witnesses. Judge Xu approved the request and ordered him to submit a detailed complaint and reschedule the hearing. Then the case filed by Ruikang was heard. It is also necessary to first resolve the issue of the subject of the lawsuit. The plaintiff's lawyer, Jiang Baolian, presented the order form, saying that the writing on the form was personally signed by Cheng Jianong at the plaintiff's foreign firm, which is sufficient to prove that Cheng is the owner of the firm. But according to Qin Tingsheng, the writing on the order form was signed by his son, who is not currently in Shanghai. Judge Xu also ordered the plaintiff to collect evidence and order Qin Tingsheng's son to appear in court and reschedule the hearing.</p>

<p>Thirteen Robbers: The Chinese and Western detectives of the Gordon Road Police Station in the Public Concession have been conducting a strict investigation into the case of the robbery of cash at the home of Gu Xuegen in Gujiabang, Changping Road, West Shanghai, on March 31, in which Chinese Constable No. 463 was shot and killed. In order to solve the case as soon as possible, yesterday afternoon at about 5:00 p.m., the head of the Gordon Road Police Station received a tip that the chief robber, Cao Jinbiao, was hiding in the Beijing Apartment at No. 439 Puhai Road in the French Concession. He immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives, equipped with weapons, to rush to the French Concession Songshan Road Police Station in police cars to meet with the local Chinese and Western detectives and secretly go to the Beijing Apartment. They arrested the robbers Cao Jinbiao, Wu Yi from Jiangbei, 38 years old, Wu Yizhi from Yancheng, 28 years old, Zhou Shudong from Jiangsu, 38 years old, and seven male robbers and two female robbers in Rooms No. 1, No. 3, and No. 24 of the apartment building, a total of thirteen people. They also found a suitcase in Room No. 1 and took it back to the police station. It is said that the robbers hiding in the Beijing Apartment have committed many crimes and are also suspected of being involved in kidnapping cases. It is planned to transfer them to the court for trial today.</p>
<p>Six Robbers: Yesterday morning at about 4:00 a.m., the police in the French Concession received a tip that robbers who had committed medical cases were hiding in a certain house on Route Lafayette in their jurisdiction. They immediately went there secretly and arrested three robbers and brought them back to the police station. According to their confession, there were still accomplices hiding on the front floor of No. 236 Guling Road in the Public Concession. After receiving the confession, the French police immediately sent a letter to the Xinzha Police Station to request detectives to assist in the arrest. Upon hearing the news, the head of the police station ordered detectives to go with them. At about 11:00 a.m. yesterday, the detectives arrived at the entrance of Yulin Lane on Guling Road, where they saw the Zhong Shengtai cigarette and paper shop, which was No. 236. They immediately surrounded the front floor of the building and arrested three male robbers. They also found four live ammunition pistols under the pillows. It is reported that the six robbers who were arrested had committed more than a dozen major robberies in the French Concession. Therefore, the police have locked the robbers in a closed room.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Manager and Foreman of Huasheng Factory Extorted 20,000 Gold by Bandits <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>One of the Bandits Was a Former Employee of the Factory</p>
<p>Rickshaw Driver Wore Steel Armor</p>
<p>Represented the Owner to Negotiate</p>
<p>Detectives Ambushed and Captured Five Bandits</p>
<p>Cao Yugui and Qi Youcai, the managers of Huasheng Electrical Appliance Factory at No. 2865 Zhoujiazui Road, and Ren Hongcai, the foreman, have been receiving threatening letters since the 3rd of this month, demanding 20,000 yuan. They also agreed to meet at the Bazihui Bridge near the Xin Xin Factory on Baoxing Road in Zhabei. The person who went should hang a vegetable basket on the rickshaw as a sign. A few days ago, Cao and others sent Liu Xiaocai in a rickshaw to meet Xue San and Zuo Qijun from Jiangbei. They started negotiations. Yuan Asan, Liu's rickshaw driver, interjected and said that Huasheng Factory's business has been poor recently and the amount demanded is too extravagant. If it were a few hundred yuan, it could be given to the manufacturer. At that time, Xue and Zuo were very dissatisfied and pulled out their guns, saying to Yuan that at least 10,000 yuan was required, otherwise they would destroy the factory and kill people. They told Liu and Yuan to go back and figure out a way, and they would reply at the same place at 7:00 p.m. on the 14th. After Liu and others returned, they told Cao and others, who reported to the Yangshupu Police Station. Detective Su Changsheng, Detective Su Yinggen, and Detective Li Pengfei rushed to Bazihui Bridge at that time and ambushed nearby. Liu and Yuan were still in contact with the bandits. Yuan was ordered to carry a paper bag, with only 25 yuan in it as a token, but the inside was waste paper. At first, Yuan was afraid of being detected by the bandits and being shot. The detectives gave him a piece of steel armor to wear inside his clothes. Yuan suddenly became brave and went forward. Seeing that the person who came was Xue San, he handed over the paper bag. Xue asked how much was in the bag. Yuan replied that it was only 500 gold. Xue thought it was too little and said that it had to be 5,000 yuan. Yuan asked him to accept it first and the rest would be raised later. Xue accepted it and turned to leave. The detectives who were ambushing in the four corners quickly rushed up and surrounded Xue. Xue tried to escape and was shot in the foot by the detectives before he was arrested. Four accomplices, Zuo Qijun, Lu Xiuqing, Sun Sankai, and Zhou Shuli, were arrested in the area. They then went to No. 1402 Dongjiaxing Road, the bandits' den, and searched it, and arrested a bandit woman, Wu Zhangshi (aka Xu Zhangshi). Except for Xue, who was sent to the hospital for treatment, the rest were taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Court, where Judge Feng Shide interrogated them. The plaintiffs, Zeng Yugui and others, proved that they had repeatedly received four threatening letters and the process of sending Liu and Yuan to contact the bandits. When asked about the defendant Zuo Qijun, he admitted that he wrote the letter, but the matter was initiated by Xue and Lu. Lu Xiuqing confessed that he used to work in the Huasheng Factory, but was laid off in August of the previous year. He is now pulling a rickshaw for a living. Xue San said that the manager of the factory, Ye Youcai's house, was robbed on the 30th of last month and received a threatening letter demanding 300 yuan. Xue wanted to imitate this act and asked Zuo to write a letter. Sun Sankai confessed that he was invited by Lu to go to Bazihui Bridge, saying that he was asking people for money. Zhou Shuli confessed that he was invited by Xue San to help him. Wu Zhangshi confessed that she worked in a yarn factory and knew nothing about this matter. There were no firearms in her house. The court ordered the defendants to be detained for a future hearing.</p>

<p>Chinese Consul Requests Shi Heshi to Sign a Written Statement</p>
<p>World News Agency, San Francisco: An American named Shi Heshi, who has worked for the Shanghai Concession Electric Company for a long time, returned to the United States with his family on the President Taft, accompanied by Zhang Yafeng, a 38-year-old woman from Sichuan. According to Yafeng, she started working on the 26th of last month. At that time, she was unwilling to travel to the United States. Shi Heshi said that if she was unwilling to go to the United States, she could only hold the child and send it off the ship. However, after boarding the ship, she was forbidden to leave. On the ship, she took care of his wife and children, washing and other things, working every day from 4:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., sometimes beaten with fists and feet. The passengers on the ship sighed that the abuse was too excessive and said that he must be forbidden to go with her and sent back to Shanghai to avoid mistreatment. At that time, someone called the Chinese Consulate General to request intervention. Consul General Zhang was away on business, and Zhang Zichang, the consular assistant, went to the ship. According to Shi Heshi, he had agreed to pay 50 yuan per month in Shanghai currency, and there was a deposit in the American Consulate. Yafeng said that the wages were indeed received by her husband, but she did not dare to disclose the abuse and said that she was willing to work as a maid. Zhang Zichang then requested Shi Heshi to sign a written statement, stipulating that Zhang Yafeng would be in the United States for a maximum of six months, and Shi Heshi's friend in this port would also sign, guaranteeing that there would be no more abuse in the future.</p>

<p>23.2 Miles Per Gallon of Gasoline</p>
<p>The various cars produced by the American General Motors Manufacturing Plant have always been highly regarded, especially the Chevrolet car, which is popular in the world. The sales in China have increased sharply year by year, because the car's engine is strong, the style is beautiful, and the price is very cheap, so it is satisfactory to all walks of life. Mr. Vctior N. De Frack, the promotion director of General Shanghai Branch, in order to increase the public's belief in the car, specially held a celebration ceremony with the Ard Yang Firm, which manages the car, from the 13th to the 16th of this month, inviting people from all walks of life to visit the firm. On the spot, there were various performances of Chevrolet's fuel-saving and strong body. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter of this newspaper was also invited to test ride. First, the firm cut off the gasoline in the car and added a glass container to the car, injecting a quarter of a gallon of gasoline, and using a leather tube to introduce the oil into the engine. Mr. De Frack personally drove it, speeding between Daxi Road, Haige Road, and Xiafei Road, traveling 5.8 miles before using up a quarter of a gallon of gasoline. Based on this calculation, Chevrolet cars can travel 23.2 miles per gallon of gasoline, making it the most fuel-efficient car. Mr. Di explained car knowledge in the car along the way, which was very detailed. People in the same car, such as Zhou Kaijia, the Chinese manager of Crowe Advertising Company, and Dai Yuren, the manager of Shanghai Weekly Forum, all praised Chevrolet's fuel efficiency and signed certificates. Later, they took a photo together at the entrance of the firm and dispersed happily.</p>

<p>Since the death of Captain Qiao of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Detective Team on the first day of the previous month, the position of captain has been temporarily held by Lu Ying, the deputy captain of the team.

Therefore, Director Yuan issued Order No. 316 yesterday, officially promoting Lu to the official captain of the team, and at the same time submitted a request to the municipal government for additional appointment, in order to encourage and reward meritorious service. Captain Lu is a graduate of the Infantry Department of the Second Term of Baoding Military Academy. He has successively served as the Instructor of Hubei Student Soldiers, the Squad Leader of the Infantry Department of the Eighth and Ninth Terms of Baoding Military Academy, the Major Staff Officer and Engineer Battalion Commander of the Sichuan Aid Corps of the Hubei Army, the Major Staff Officer of the Fourth Division of the Army, the Lieutenant Colonel Corps Attachment and Third Battalion Commander of the Infantry Fourteenth Regiment, the Colonel Commander of the Sixty-third Regiment of the Twelfth Mixed Brigade, the Colonel Commander of the Seventh Regiment of the Twenty-sixth Army, the Chief of Staff of the Jinan Recruitment Envoy's Office, and the Section Chief of the Investigation Section of the Concession, Zhabei, and Huxi Districts of the Songhu Garrison Command Detective Team.

<p>Zhu Zhongheng, who used to work at Lawyer Zhang Chongding's office, was a matchmaker. However, the woman he matched, surnamed Mou, eloped without a trace a few months after marrying Wu Chengle. Wu wanted to negotiate with Zhu, but Zhu refused to see him. They met on Xin Da Gu Road a few days ago. Wu turned Zhu over to the patrolmen, but Zhu escaped. Wu shouted for the arrest of a thief. A plainclothes detective, Liu Longchao, happened to pass by and fired a shot, injuring Zhu in the ribs. He was sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Details have been recorded in this newspaper. Unfortunately, Zhu's injury was fatal and could not be cured. He died in the hospital the day before yesterday. After receiving the report, the police station sent a detective to take the body to the corpse examination office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, they reported to the Special District Court and commissioned Inspector Guo to visit the office for clarification. Because no family members were found, it was ordered that the Pushen Villa be responsible for the funeral.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Liu Caisheng Acquitted in Extortion Case <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Cao Xiaolong, along with the woman Tan Tingjin, the former accuser Zhang A'san (also known as Su Yongchang), Li Jinbiao, Liu Caisheng, and the woman Wang A'feng, etc., illegally detained Tan Tingjin at No. 16 Moulin Street, Avenue Joffre, in the French Concession, attempting to extort 5,000 yuan in foreign currency. The police arrested Zhang Su and brought him to the Special District Local Court. Liu Caisheng was released on bail after questioning, while the others were detained for further investigation, as previously reported. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi continued the joint hearing. The two defendants, Zhang and Wang, hired lawyer Fan Gang, while Liu hired lawyers Wang Fuchang and others to defend them in court. First, the police lawyers, Ru Baoyi, Wang, and Yaotang, stood up and requested the withdrawal of the charges against Liu Caisheng, because the police investigation showed that Liu was not involved in the case. Judge Wu stated that according to Article 264 of the criminal law, withdrawal of a complaint should be made before the start of the first instance trial. Since the trial was already in progress, it should await legal judgment. The request of the police was therefore denied. The police lawyers then further explained the difficulties of the police in handling cases and the reasons for requesting the withdrawal of the complaint after the case was submitted. They said that the police should abide by the agreement for criminal defendants, and submit the case within 24 hours after the arrest. They did not have sufficient time to conduct a detailed investigation like the domestic judicial authorities. Therefore, the usual practice was to submit the defendant within a definite period to comply with the agreement, and then conduct further investigation. If it was found that the defendant had not committed a crime, even if the trial was in progress, they could request the withdrawal of the complaint. If it was believed that since the trial had already begun, the withdrawal could not be made halfway, and it must wait for the judgment, the law would certainly be so, but the defendant would inevitably suffer unnecessary harm. In order to avoid this kind of suffering for the defendant, they should act according to previous practice. Liu Caisheng's lawyers, Wang Fuchang and others, seeing that the court did not grant the police's request, stood up and requested that the part concerning Liu Caisheng be debated first, citing precedent. The court approved it. The lawyers made their arguments, and Judge Wu announced the verdict that Liu Caisheng was innocent and released. Then the other defendants were interrogated again, and the result was that they were still remanded in custody separately, and the hearing was continued to a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Former Concubine's Lawsuit for Money <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Decai, residing at No. 808 Xiang Kang Lane, Baker Road, works as a clerk for a foreign firm, earning more than one hundred yuan a month. He is not yet thirty, but already has three wives and concubines. His third concubine, Wang Jin'e, is twenty-four years old and has been freely associated with Zhang for three years, having one child, also three years old. She is currently pregnant. They first built a golden house in the north of the Huangpu River, and then moved to No. 812 1/2 Xiang Kang Lane. The three wives and concubines lived in the same lane. Unexpectedly, on March 10th of this year, Zhang and Wang Jin'e developed animosity, and both wanted to separate. They went to a certain hotel and wrote a separation agreement, each holding a copy. There were no witnesses at the time of the agreement. Afterwards, Wang Jin'e claimed that in addition to the separation agreement, Zhang had also given her a note promising to pay 1,600 yuan. She hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the Special District Local Court, requesting an order to pay 1,600 yuan in foreign currency. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenrong opened the court. The plaintiff, Wang Jin'e, explained the situation and submitted the note as evidence. She also invited the landlady of the second landlord, Zhu Li, to testify, who claimed to have heard Wang asking Zhang for money, but did not know what kind of money she was asking for. Zhang denied having written the note. Both lawyers debated to the end. Judge Xu ordered both parties to wait for the verdict on the morning of the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Why are There So Many Lawsuits for Divorce? <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Ma Tongli Sues Wife</p>
<p>Ma Tongli, a resident of this county, recently sued his wife, Ma Ma'shi, in the local court, claiming that she was unchaste and dared to run away with his belongings. He stated that he could not live with her anymore and requested a divorce. His statement was roughly as follows: The plaintiff is thirty years old this year, living at No. 27 He Kang Lane, Nine Acres. On February 1st of the 17th year of the Republic of China, he married the defendant, Ma Ma'shi, through a matchmaker. They have not had any children. However, the defendant is unusually fierce, often going out, even staying out overnight. On July 17th of last year, after being reprimanded by the defendant's aunt, she falsely accused the plaintiff of beating her and filed a lawsuit. The court sentenced him, but he was acquitted on appeal. Since then, the defendant has disappeared without returning. He searched repeatedly without success. Therefore, starting from March 16th of this year, he published advertisements in various newspapers, such as Shen Xinmin, calling for her to return quickly, but still there was no news. The defendant had falsely accused him, and the plaintiff was almost criminally punished. It is clear that the defendant has inflicted a serious insult on the plaintiff, and the affection has been severed. This is one reason for divorce. Not having offspring is the greatest form of unfilial piety. Since marrying, there have been no children. Letting her leave without a trace will leave the plaintiff a widower for a long time, worried like Bo Dao. This is not fair. This is the second reason for divorce. When the defendant ran away, she took everything, showing that she had no intention of returning. This is the third reason for divorce. Therefore, he filed this lawsuit, requesting permission for divorce. The defendant stated in the criminal lawsuit against the plaintiff that she lived at No. 140 Mao De Lane, Binlang Road, Little Sandu. Now that she is gone without a trace, he requests a public announcement for service of process. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00, Judge Yang Keqian specially opened the Sixth Tribunal to hear the case. The plaintiff arrived in court with his lawyer, Shen Yong. Since the defendant's address was unknown, a special representative lawyer, Ren Enji, appeared in court to present her case. The judge questioned the plaintiff, Ma Tongli, who stated the previous circumstances and presented the published advertisements as evidence for the court's inspection. The judge then invited the prosecutor, Xu, to the court to express his opinion. After the lawyers Shen and Ren debated each other, the judge announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the morning of the 19th of this month. Then the court adjourned.</p>
<p>Shi Erlang Sues Her Husband</p>
<p>Shi Erlang, a woman from Chongming, recently hired lawyer Gong Yingxuan to sue her husband, Yang Quanlang, in the local court, claiming that he had seduced and then abandoned her, and requested a divorce. She stated that she was originally the wife of Huang Zhiwen, but unfortunately her husband died in the 14th year of the Republic of China. Then, through the matchmaker Chen Dashu, she remarried to Yang Quanlang. It was only after she married him that she learned that the defendant still had a wife. She regretted it. Recently, she has been subjected to abuse and abandonment. Therefore, she wants to separate from him. The defendant, Yang Quanlang, also hired lawyer Gong Tongyuan to file a counterclaim, claiming that Shi Erlang, under the instigation of an adulterer, falsely sued for divorce. He filed a counterclaim, requesting that she be ordered to live with him and to recover the silver and clothing that she had taken. He also claimed that he married Shi Erlang as a concubine in the 15th year of the Republic of China through a matchmaker. For the first five years, the relationship was quite good, so he opened an oil shop in the South City and let her manage the money. Later, because Shi Erlang secretly had an affair with Zhou Chengzhang, the love between the couple broke down. Due to the importance of face, he tolerated it. On February 27th of this year, she was again instigated by the adulterer Zhou Chengzhang and took more than 500 yuan in cash and jewelry from the shop, leaving nothing behind. Therefore, he published a warning in the newspaper and filed a lawsuit in the prosecutor's office of the court, requesting that the plaintiff's lawsuit be rejected and that she be ordered to live with him. Yesterday, Judge Du Xian opened the court for hearing. Both parties and their lawyers stated their cases. The judge tried to reconcile them, but neither side agreed. After the debate began, he announced the end and scheduled the verdict for the 17th (today).</p>

<p>Conclusion of Hearing on Abandonment of Wife Case</p>
<p>Verdict Scheduled for the 21st</p>
<p>Gao Fengshi (age 43), a woman from Changshu, and her son Gao Xiangcheng (age 20) sued her husband Gao Songlin in the local court, claiming that he had abandoned them and requested to live with him. Their complaint stated that when the plaintiff was 21 years old, her younger brother opened a bamboo weaving shop in Jin Sheng Lane behind the New Yamen (i.e., the Special District Court). At that time, there was a man named Wu A'er who also lived in Jin Sheng Lane. The defendant, Gao Songlin, was friends with Wu and very close to him. Therefore, Gao often went to Wu's place to play and chat. That's how the plaintiff got to know the defendant. Then he asked Lu Jie, Wu A'er to be matchmakers, and came to her house saying that his wife had died and that he wanted to remarry the plaintiff as his wife. They got married that year and lived together at No. 10 Gongyi Old Factory, Caojiadu (because the defendant was from Caojiadu). They lived together for more than a year and then moved back to the defendant's house. Only then did she realize that the defendant still had a first wife. But what's done is done, and she had to blame herself. She lived with the first wife for three years. Because she was abused by the first wife, she moved to Nanchang Fen Lane in Shanghai and lived with the defendant for about four years. They then moved to No. 107 Beilong, Shunjin Lane, Hongzhen. Since last year, the defendant has not come often and has not cared about the daily expenses. She has not been paid any attention. Therefore, she filed this lawsuit, requesting to live with him. The case was opened for hearing but not concluded. Yesterday, Judge Du opened the court again for a continued hearing. The defendant hired lawyer Liu Huihuang to defend him. The plaintiff Gao Fengshi and her son Gao Xiangcheng arrived in court, recounting the previous situation. When asked, the defendant Gao Songlin stated that he was 55 years old and from Caojiadu. He denied that the plaintiff was his wife and said that his father had a grocery store when he was alive. The plaintiff was a neighbor and often came to the store to buy things. That's how they met. They talked and joked, that was true, but there was no cohabitation. Gao Yang, 57 years old, also testified, saying that Gao Songlin was her husband and lived in Gao's house in Caojiadu. Her husband did not take a concubine. At this point, the plaintiff interrupted and said that when she married him, it was said to be a replacement wife. Moreover, her son, Xiangcheng, was indeed born to Gao Songlin. If the court did not believe her, they could do a blood test. She asked the court to examine Xiangcheng's face to see if it was the same as the defendant's. The judge understood the situation and announced the end of the debate, scheduling the verdict for the 21st of this month.</p>

<p>Bottle of Lysol</p>
<p>Life is in Great Danger</p>
<p>The North Station Grand Hotel at No. 5 Jielu, North Railway Station, had a male and female passenger from Fujian last month, carrying several pieces of luggage. They were led into room number 20 by the tea boy. The registration book showed Gu Jinfu, age 24, and Ms. Gu, age 21, both from Fujian. They had been staying at the hotel for more than a month. They often went out hand in hand, showing great affection. Two days ago, Gu Jinfu went out and did not return. Only Ms. Gu was in the room. Yesterday morning around ten o'clock, Ms. Gu went out alone. Not long after, she returned to the hotel. At three o'clock in the afternoon, she rang the bell and told the tea boy that she was not feeling well today and needed some tea to drink. The tea boy went out and brought boiling tea into the room. He caught sight of her lying on the bed, her face pale. He called out to her, but she did not respond. He immediately reported to the accounting office and hired a car to take her to Tongren Hospital for treatment. When she arrived at the hospital, she was already delirious and unable to speak. After the doctor gave her an injection and medicine, she gradually woke up. It was discovered that she had taken "Lysol". She was transferred to Guangren Hospital. Because she had taken too much poison, her life was in danger. According to the investigation, Ms. Gu took the poison because her husband Jinfu had another lover. It's truly tragic.</p>

<p>Jin Chongxuan Dies by Hanging</p>
<p>Zhou Peiyin Fears Being Implicated</p>
<p>Jin Chongxuan, 36 years old, from Yongjia, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, had been unemployed for a long time. He came to Shanghai to make a living. His younger brother, Jin Chongwen, was a boatman. After Chongxuan arrived in Shanghai, he stayed with his brother's friend, Zhou Peiyin. Zhou lived at No. 179 Huining Road, near the Xin Puyu Hall in the South City. He ran a wood shop called Zhou Changfeng Woodworks. Because Jin had no job in Shanghai to support himself, he obtained a permit to live as a peddler. However, he was unfamiliar with the area and had few customers. He also suffered from a severe illness and could not eat. He could only eat two buns a day. Although he was hungry, he could not swallow. He could only blame himself and could not find a way out. So, the night before, he hanged himself in his residence to end his life. Zhou, fearing being implicated, carried the body to the gate of Xu Shuncheng Copperworks at No. 250 behind the vocational school and hung it on the door, making it look like he had died outside. Yesterday morning, Xu Shuncheng's partner discovered the body and was shocked. He fell to the ground and could not speak for a long time. After being awakened by his companions, he told them to look. They were all alarmed and notified the police. The police inspected the way the deceased was hanged and determined that he had not died there. They investigated and found out the truth. Zhou's wife, Zhou Wangshi, was detained and interrogated at the Second Precinct's Second Substation. The neighborhood chief, Gu Tiyun, from the 25th Bao and 12th Tu was ordered to report to the local court for an inquest. Prosecutor Yang and the coroner arrived at the scene. They found that the deceased had indeed died by hanging. They ordered the family to collect the body and await further instructions.</p>

<p>Three Traffickers Sentenced to Jail as a Warning</p>
<p>Tang Zhangshi, a woman from Ningbo, 24 years old, twice abducted children on the 21st and 25th of last month. The first was Li Xiaomao, a 6-year-old boy from the home of Li Baishi, a Ningbo woman, at No. 61 Yongyu Lane, Beller Road, in the French Concession. The others were Qiuhe, a 10-year-old girl from the home of Yuan Qitao, a Songjiang man, at No. 206 Route Say Zou-Ling, along with Tianru, a 6-year-old boy, and Tianshun, a 10-month-old boy (carried out by Qiuhe). The last was Juhua, a 9-year-old girl from the home of Zhang Shiyong at No. 209 on the same street. She colluded with Wang Menghong and his wife, who were vendors on the Xin Ningxing steamship, and asked someone to take the children to Ningbo. The first child, Li Xiaomao, was sold to Wang Aigui's family in Jiangbei for 80 yuan to be their son. The remaining four children were taken to Fushi Pavilion and sold to Wang A'mei's family in the countryside. While they were negotiating the price, the French Concession detectives Cao Anchang and Bao Hangguangfu discovered the situation and arrested Tang Zhangshi and Wang Menghong, as well as Wang Maoshi, who was involved. They were taken to the police station. Then they went to Jiangbei, Fushi Pavilion, and other places in Ningbo to retrieve all five children and bring them back to Shanghai. The French Concession police first returned them to their families. Yesterday, Zhangshi and others were sent to the French Court for investigation. Each plaintiff reported the previous situation, saying that the children were watching a funeral procession in front of the door when they were abducted. They requested a strict investigation. Tang Zhangshi confessed to abducting the children and receiving 80 yuan for Li Xiaomao. The woman shared 39 yuan, and the rest was shared by Wang Menghong and others. Wang Menghong stated that Zhangshi gave the five children to the wife of a civilian to sell in Ningbo. Afterwards, the civilian received 15 yuan. He did not know where his wife had fled. Wang Maoshi stated that Wang Menghong was the woman's younger uncle. Although the woman also shared 15 yuan in this abduction, she was not present at the time and asked for leniency. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Tang Zhangshi to four years in the women's prison, after which she would be expelled from the French Concession. Tang Zhangshi's four-year-old daughter, Liu Peng, would be sent to the Jiliang Institute to be raised. Wang Menghong was sentenced to one year in the Western prison. Wang Maoshi was sentenced to one month as a warning.</p>

However, he was injured internally and bled too much from his intestines, and died around 7:00 yesterday morning.</p>

<p>At 6:45 yesterday morning, the first express train from Zhabei on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway arrived at the South Station. At 1:05 in the afternoon, one of the cars in the train, a 168 third-class passenger car, suddenly caught fire. Because the weather was dry and windy, the fire was fierce. The stationmaster immediately ordered the railway police officers stationed at the station, Cai Qingquan and Zhu Hongfei, to cooperate with the station staff to board the car and try to put out the fire. The fire was quickly extinguished. The cause of the fire was sparks from the engine's coal fire that flew onto the roof of the car. The car was uncoupled and sent to the factory for repairs.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Farewell Chronicle of the Chinese Athletes' Delegation in Two Days <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiping</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Games, which contain a non-military international war, will be held in Tokyo on the 26th of this month. Our country has carefully selected more than 130 athletes to go abroad for the expedition. This feat has already caused a sensation across the country. The weight of the mission the athletes bear and the eagerness of the people of the country are self-evident. The farewell party held by 24 Shanghai organizations on the 8th floor of the Hua'an Building on the 13th and the send-off at the Wusong Wharf yesterday truly represent the enthusiastic mood of the entire nation. I have excerpted the trivial matters of those two days and briefly written them to tell the readers of Free Talk.</p>
<p>On the 13th, the reception at the venue, such as Huang Jingwan and Zhu Shaoping, were busy arranging the venue in an orderly manner. After 2:00 PM, more than 100 male and female athletes arrived one after another, full of energy, worthy of the true color of Chinese athletes. It is a pity that the once famous Sun Guiyun did not come, and Zhao Dexin was absent due to serious illness. The eccentric Liu Changchun勉强 (mian qiang - did with effort) attended with a limping foot. It is said that the foot injury will be difficult to recover for a while, which seems worrying. The highly respected old man Ma Xiangbo, who is in his nineties, also came with a cane. This old man is really in high spirits. After a group photo at half past two, the guests and hosts took their seats and held a ceremony. The speeches of all the guests contained profound meaning and did not involve the bad habit of flattery. Chen Dezhen's opening speech was based on the benevolent intention of "a gentleman loves others with virtue," with a tone of advice and warning. He opposed others blindly praising the scene and hoped that the athletes would pay attention to hygiene and behavior, and take into account the face and glory of the country in everything. Ma Xianglao's speech, looking back on the past and present, was extremely sad. He said that the current situation in China is because we have lost our duty as masters. Chinese people like to talk about appearances. He remembered when Yuan Shikai was in power, he was told how well the police in Beijing were managed, boasting that they were not inferior to foreigners. He replied that the appearance was the same, but the substance was still lacking. Yuan did not like to hear this. He hoped that the athletes would pay attention. He also said that the Japanese are insidious and cunning. In the past, there was Huo Yuanjia, who had extraordinary strength. The strongmen of various countries were not his opponents. Later, he was envied by the Japanese, and as a result, he died of poisoning. The old man saw through his treachery, and the listeners were furious. The physical educationist Wu Yunrui said that our country's athletes are not lacking in physical strength, but the methods are not good. The best thing to do on this trip is to capture their sports posture and use it as a model after returning. Liu Jinzhu said that the Japanese despise our compatriots and even insult us with inferior nationalities. When you are in the East, you should pay attention to hygiene everywhere and do not speak loudly or shout strangely. Even if you encounter unfairness during the competition, do not resort to violence. He described the Japanese's malicious conspiracies to the fullest. Finally, Lu Ming, on behalf of the athletes' delegation, accepted the yellow silk flag "Our Martial Arts Promote" presented by the 24 organizations, and replied on behalf of them. His words were very appropriate. His general idea was that the schools have the name of physical education guidance but no actual guidance. Many people put the responsibility of sports on a few athletes and do not have a comprehensive plan. They treat athletes as a special class, which is tantamount to severely criticizing those who misunderstand physical education. Finally, the guests and hosts bowed to each other and dispersed.</p>
<p>On the 15th, the weather was clear and a gentle breeze was blowing. At 7:00 AM, the Wusong Wharf was already crowded with people, and the traffic in front of the gate was heavy and could not be squeezed out. The Chinese athletes arrived one after another after 8:00 AM. The men and women were all beaming and full of energy. The photographers from various newspapers were busy and overwhelmed. Huang Jingwan called himself the director, and the reporters benefited greatly from his assistance. Sun Guiyun was most afraid of people taking pictures of her, but the reporters all wanted to try it. According to her, she had a total of forty or fifty pictures taken of her in the morning. Li Xinghua and Li Mudan also had many pictures taken. Professor Bu Qi (transliteration) and his wife from Northeast University were also very eye-catching. They are both physical educationists and newly married. They took the opportunity to spend their honeymoon. The new couple frequently comforted the Northeast athletes. When she was photographed, she was embarrassed. Bu Qi was very straightforward and insisted on taking a picture with his wife. The two of them pulled and held each other, and the audience laughed. Zhang Boling is the general representative of the Chinese team. As soon as he arrived at the port, the people who came to see him off were eager to shake hands with him. He seemed to be very afraid of trouble, so he ran to the highest floor of the ship and chatted with the captain and first officer. Hao Boyang arrived late as the host. Many Chinese and foreigners were looking for him to talk to him. He shuttled through the crowd, with a smile on his face. A certain girls' school and a certain chamber of commerce in Japan presented two commemorative flags, embroidered with "Great China" and other words. Representative Hao accepted them happily on behalf of the entire group. At 9:30, more and more people came. The sound of gongs on the ship rose up. The send-offers and passengers were busy for a while. Only to see colorful paper circles, thrown at each other. In a moment, it was covered as dense as a spider web, fluttering in the wind, which was very interesting. At 10:00, the whistle blew, and the Dayang Maru moved slowly. The shouts of "pull" and the sound of铿锵 (keng qiang - sonorous) music gradually weakened. More than a thousand guests and athletes said goodbye for a while.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Buddhist Music Holding Buddha Chi Fo <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Our country's local accents vary from place to place. The Wu dialect is soft, and the Central Plains dialect is grand. The Min and Yue dialects are different. Only when chanting Buddhist scriptures, singing praises to the Western Paradise, and hitting the fish-shaped woodblock and chime stones, the melodies are clear and loud, and the Brahman chants are sonorous, the whole country seems to be in the same rhythm. Some say that chanting Buddha is a matter of pure practice, so why bother with musical scales to promote the Buddha's name and sing Buddhist songs? In the Buddhist monastic rules, there is a saying that one should not engage in singing, dancing, or music. They do not know that music touches people most deeply. Chanting Buddha while striking the fish-shaped woodblock and chime stones, hitting the bell and beating the drum, is precisely to harmonize the mind and nature. The two characters "ritual" and "music" are the great methods for sages to govern the world, which the Confucians speak of in the most detail. In our Buddhist tradition, when selecting the perfect and complete root, the wise Manjushri chose the ear root alone. Guanyin attained enlightenment the earliest, and her cultivation was achieved from understanding the nature of hearing. The beings of the Saha world do not understand this principle. Some slander harmonious singing, and some denounce Buddhist music. Is this not a fallacy? One must know that chanting Buddha while harmonizing with musical scales was advocated by the fourth ancestor of the Lotus sect, Dharma Master Fazhao. The so-called Five Assemblies Great Assembly has a very profound meaning.</p>
<h3 id="e199">A'gang's Stomach Gu Lian <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>A'qiao saw an advertisement in the newspaper that Yantai Beer and Yili Soda were giving away free drinks at the New World, and sighed that it was a rare and cheap opportunity. He pulled A'gang to Bai Xiang (visit) at the New World. A'gang said to A'qiao on the road, "Spending two jiao xiaoyang, you can drink ten or eight bottles of beer and a dozen or half a dozen bottles of soda. The boss of that beer and soda company is too sacrificing. They must really be a'gang. I'm called A'gang, and I don't quite believe it." A'qiao said, "You're trying to be clever again. Such a big company wouldn't lie." When the two of them arrived at the New World, they saw many people crowded together, drinking as much as they wanted without limit. A'gang was so happy that he couldn't speak. He drank seven and a half bottles of beer in a row, and his stomach immediately bulged. He really couldn't hold any more, so he turned around to drink soda. A'qiao said, "You've already had your fill of beer. You can stop drinking soda for a while and come back to drink it later." A'gang thought for a moment and said, "Huh. My stomach for beer is full, but my stomach for soda is still empty." A'qiao laughed and said, "You're really a'gang. How can one person have two stomachs?"</p>
<p>Visiting a Scene from The Merchant of Venice</p>
<p>— Chang Yue</p>
<p>On the evening of a previous day, I visited director Ying Yunwei on a matter of business. It happened that the Drama Association was rehearsing the elopement scene from Shakespeare's great work, "The Merchant of Venice." I was very fortunate to have a preview. The play was translated from English and used pure Mandarin dialogue. In my humble opinion, translation is the most difficult part of literature. There is often a tendency to leave out the essence and keep the dross. Only this play can avoid its common defects. The wording and arrangement of the sentences are all suitable for our country's grammar. In addition, the actors' pronunciation is correct and the tone is clear, so everyone can understand it.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the scene, there were two people acting as lookouts to help with the elopement, holding torches and waiting for the protagonist, Lu Lun, so that they could go together. But Lu did not arrive for a long time. The two of them then made a lot of arguments, expounding the meaning of lovers' appointments and love. And the philosophy in it is also in line with the current situation of fashionable people in Shanghai. The indirect and subtle criticisms are incisive. If those who are fickle and opportunistic can hear this wonderful theory and not be ashamed to death, I don't believe it.</p>
<p>Then Lu hurried up, pointed to the mansion behind him in a low voice and said to his lookouts, "My father-in-law lives here." The appearance was quite appropriate. Suddenly, he saw a figure in the house, which seemed to be male, and was extremely frightened. Soon he realized that the man in the house was his lover, who had changed her hairpin for a cap. So the color of joy overflowed his eyebrows. The oaths of love and the subtlety of the two people's affection were exhausted. When they ran away, the atmosphere in the whole scene was very tense. It is appropriate to sneak away from people like this.</p>
<p>Overall, this scene was performed with emotion and reason, and was impeccable. All four actors were able to maintain their identity, and among them, the actor who played Lu Lun was the most rare. The actor has a delicate face and a strong body. He combines solemnity and humor. There are many similarities with the former movie star Valentino. In this scene, he showed the expressions of elation, fright, joy, and panic to perfection. The various transitions added a lot of color to the play. Director Ying has a discerning eye and found this talent. Is it really true that there is a Bole in the world before there is a thousand-mile horse? (Not paid)</p>

<p>We are about to set off for Chicago, where we are scheduled to perform for ten days. Then we will go to San Francisco and then to Honolulu. Then we will return to China. Wanhua has a strong ambition to tour Europe in one go, but the people traveling with her have been away from home for a long time and are eager to return, so she is hesitating. We will see what the situation is at that time and then decide. Although we have stopped performing and are resting these days, Wanhua is still busy. There are people painting portraits, taking photos, sculpting, news reporters, people in the theater world, and those who admire her and ask to see her. It is really like the road in Shanyin, and she is overwhelmed. And tea parties and banquets are still going on at the same time. In the evening, she went to various theaters to watch plays with Mr. Zhang Pengchun and others, enthusiastically studying.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 23rd, Wanhua hosted a banquet for people from all walks of life. Many people came. She said a few grand words at the banquet, saying that she was very grateful for the special welcome from all walks of life when she first came to your country. She hoped that the friendship between the two countries would be enhanced through artistic relations. She thanked the public for their praise of Chinese art on behalf of the Chinese art community. The guests left happily.</p>
<p>Wanhua has indeed lost a lot of weight, probably because she is too tired. But her spirit is still not reduced. Since she achieved great success here, she has been even more humble in her attitude. It is really admirable.</p>
<p>There is a great drama critic here named Mr. Yang Siarh Young. He is the most admiring of Wanhua's art. The day before yesterday, he gave her a ring that was a Roman artifact from five hundred years ago. There are very many other people who give her souvenirs.</p>
<p>Last year, I saw a Paris newsletter in a domestic newspaper. The International Drama Association was established in Paris. Dr. Xie Shoukang was the participant from our country. He proposed at the conference that Wanhua be invited to Paris next year (this year). At that time, the representatives of various countries were very supportive, but the cost was too great. Later, the president of the association, Mr. Momey (Director of the Second National Theater of France), discussed and planned to send a letter to major theaters along the way to Moscow and Berlin in the name of the association to invite her to perform, so that it would not be difficult. Now that there is a plan to tour Europe, it may be possible to contact them. But I am afraid that there is not enough time to prepare in a short time. We will have to talk about it after returning to China. A very large exposition will be held in Chicago next year. Someone wants to write a play with a world perspective for Wanhua and prepare to invite him to sing. They all say that it will be better than American actors. From this, we can also know the general admiration of the American mind.</p>

<p>However, when a person's luck turns, naturally blessings arrive and their hearts are bright. Turning ugliness into beauty... Everyone who saw her superb acting skills and beauty said, "Her reputation is well-deserved." This time, the congratulatory performance for Liu Yinbo's wedding not only did not harm the old troupe of the theater that brought him to Shanghai, but also benefited them. Although they only watched one excerpt from "Fen He Wan", how could that be enough? When he officially took the stage three days later, the box seats and flower halls were sold out long in advance. They were booked for a week in advance. Because those who had seen the play at Wei Chun Yuan that day told those who had not seen his play, spreading the word to each other. The people of Shanghai are all fond of fresh novelties. Now that such a famous actress with both beauty and talent has come from Beijing, how could they not go and feast their eyes? Therefore, when Mei Lanfang came to Shanghai for the first time, from the day he took the stage, he sang for a full month. They also retained him for three more days to sing a farewell memento. There was not a single day that the theater was not sold out. That theater had already closed its iron gates at 9:00 PM. From then on, Mei Lanfang enjoyed great fame both in the north and south. It is said that after Liu Yinbo's wedding, they went to Hangzhou for their honeymoon according to Western customs. At that time, a certain major bank in Beijing was about to hire a banking expert. Knowing that Liu Yinbo had studied banking, they hired him. However, in the second half of the year, it was time for Liu Xingshu's wedding. Liu Xingshu's temperament and disposition were somewhat different from those of his elder brother. Yinbo was a magnanimous and open person, while Xingshu was a cautious and careful person. At that time, Yinbo had several positions in the north and wanted to persuade Xingshu to give up his work in the publishing house and newspaper office and come to the north to work. However, Xingshu was a little hesitant. It turned out that he was preparing for his own wedding. He was also preparing to get married in Shanghai. Since he was getting married in Shanghai, he naturally could not leave Shanghai for the time being. Moreover, he also had a temper. He wanted to do everything himself. It was not that he did not trust others, but he felt that he would feel more at ease if he did it himself. The first thing was the economic issue. He was a competitive person. He did not want to be too frugal in this wedding. His father was very fair to his two sons, subsidizing them each with one thousand yuan. In addition, since they were able to get married, they naturally had the ability to be self-reliant. Because their father, although he was engaged in business, was born poor and had no extra savings. If Xingshu wanted to ask his father to transfer some money from his business for his wedding, it would not be impossible. However, he was very unwilling to trouble his father with his wedding. According to him, since he was already a husband of more than twenty years old, he should be able to support himself. It would be best if he did not even need the thousand yuan from his father.</p>

<p>Finance: Interbank lending rates rise, liquidity in the dollar market eases</p>
<p>Market Overview: The volume of foreign currency transactions in recent days has been significantly higher than before, consistently exceeding 30,000 to 50,000 [units] daily. However, despite the active trading, the funds are ultimately being utilized within the local market and have not been exported. Consequently, neither prices nor market sentiment have shown a significant increase. Currently, the demand in other regions is primarily met by banknotes, with silver becoming a secondary commodity. As a result, interest rates on silver are unable to rise substantially. After a period of easy credit, the silver market has tightened again due to the higher volume of outward remittances.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Quotes: For "dollar interest," the early morning rate was two fen within the customs barrier, equivalent to 7 qian, 1 fen, 9 li, 8 hao, and 7 hu and a half. By the afternoon, it had risen to 7 qian and 2 fen. Although the fluctuation was only 1 hao and 2 hu and a half, it had lingered around the 2 fen mark for quite some time. "Silver interest" rose yesterday due to the substantial remittances required by banks, causing a slight tightening of the silver market. The early morning rate was 1 qian and 2 fen, and the afternoon rate was 1 qian and 3 fen, a significant improvement of 5 fen compared to the previous day. The "hua tou" (premium for silver) plus the water content naturally rose, becoming 1 qian and 3 or 4 fen. Bank rates also reached 5 fen in the market.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: The market for "Jiangnan small dollars" remained mediocre. The early morning rate was 6 qian, 3 fen, and 6 [li], while the afternoon rate was 6 qian, 3 fen, and 8 [li]. The rates were the same for both sessions compared to the previous day's exchange. The trading volume was 2,000 jiao in the early morning and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon. There was also demand for "Guangdong small dollars," reportedly amounting to over 200,000 jiao. Consequently, the market price suddenly soared. The early morning rate was 6 qian, 0 fen, 2 li, 1 hao, and 2 hu and a half, while the afternoon rate reached 6 qian, 0 fen, and 4 li and a half, an improvement of 2 li, 3 hao, and 7 hu and a half compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 170,000 jiao in the early morning and 110,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins also increased by 3,500 wen, reaching 406,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Inflow and Outflow: Yesterday, the banks' receipts and payments were uneven. Foreign banks had special receipts and payments of 2-3 million in notes and 2.3 million in cash. Chinese banks, on the other hand, paid out over 1 million in cash. Note receipts and payments totaled 2.6-2.7 million. Receipts from various goods, exchange, taxes, miscellaneous items, and mortgage and telegraphic transfers totaled approximately 10 million. Foreign banks deposited 1.2 million into warehouses, while Chinese banks withdrew 500,000. Japanese banks received and paid out over 4 million in various funds and deposited 800,000 into warehouses. Money shops received and paid out 28 million in silver public bonds, 4 million in "hua tou" (premium for silver), and over 1.1 million in remittances from various routes, along with several hundred thousand in cash payments.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency Inflow and Outflow: The market trading volume for foreign exchange and notes in the early morning was 1.98 million and 1.18 million in the afternoon. Banknotes traded 5,000 in the early morning and 15,000 in the afternoon. Outside the market, banknotes traded 175,000 in the early morning and 74,000 in the afternoon. Silver traded 120,000 in the early morning and 95,000 in the afternoon. Bank trading volume in the early morning was 700,000 for interbank transactions and 550,000 in the afternoon. Foreign banks received and paid out over 1.1 million in foreign currency transactions, with banknote inflows and outflows of 400,000-500,000. Customer funds amounted to over 800,000, with 1.3 million being shipped out. Money shops received and paid out 3.8 million in foreign public bonds, 1.9 million in foreign exchange premiums, and over 700,000 in interbank foreign currency loans. Transactions by smaller money shops amounted to over 800,000.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Golden Market Upheaval <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Prohibition of Gold Bar Exports…Levying of Silver Tax</p>
<p>Bulls Suddenly Hit…Rushing to Exit</p>
<p>Nineteen Taels of Twists and Turns in the Gold Market</p>
<p>Total Drop of Eleven Taels and Eight [Qian] Yesterday</p>
<p>The Origin of the Reaction: Yesterday, there was a dramatic change in the gold market, with extremely chaotic and disorganized conditions. The price plummeted by over ten taels, with fluctuations of several taels at times. The morning session experienced nineteen taels of twists and turns, while the afternoon session still had seven taels of variations, making it difficult to predict. The reason for the sudden change was the government's sudden announcement of a ban on cash exports and the levying of silver tax. This caused a shock to the market, resulting in a strong reaction.</p>
<p>Forward Traders First Paid In, Then Paid Out: Yesterday was the forward rollover, marking the start of the July contract. The market opened at 8 o'clock, and trading began. Initially, those trading June for July paid in three or four qian, then settled, and finally, the bulls ended up paying out six or seven qian. By noon, it was only two qian. The situation was very confusing. There was no trading in the June contract, with most switching to the July contract. The opening price was 520 taels, and the closing price was 513 taels and 5 qian. Based on the July contract, this was a drop of 11 taels and 8 qian compared to the previous day, reversing the previous high prices. In the afternoon, price listings were generally posted.</p>
<p>Sudden Changes After the July Contract Entered the Market: The trading among dealers in the July contract was so chaotic that it was difficult to track. However, Wanxing, Shunli, Taixing, and others were buying, while Fuchang, Yuanmaoyong, Chengfengyong, and others were selling. Foreign exchange showed some decline, but not as significant as the change in gold prices. Bank purchases were still good. From the start of the morning session, the large bars shrank, immediately showing weakness, and then plummeted by over ten taels, suddenly reaching 501 taels. Rumors of a cash export ban spread, causing widespread panic. Later, buyers became active, and the price rebounded by over ten taels, but the market remained volatile. Afterwards, the market declined again, with turbulent waves. Firms such as Wanxing and Shunli continued to buy, while large firms such as Zhifengyong, Taixing, and Yuansheng aggressively sold. Eventually, the price fell below 510 taels. The price of British silver bars shrank by one-sixteenth to one-eighth, and the silver price decreased by three-eighths.</p>
<p>Lowest Drop to 01 Taels at 8:30: The July contract opened at 520 taels, with Fuchang and others rushing to sell, causing a rapid decline of 19 taels to around 501 taels at 8:30. Afterwards, buyers took advantage of the drop, causing a sudden jump of over 16 taels. Around 9:30, it was 17 taels and a half. The initial announcement was not updated, and it suddenly dropped to 13 taels and 5 qian. Then, it rose by 2 taels. Suddenly, there were more sellers, and the exchange rate seemed to weaken. By 10:00, it had fallen 4 taels to 510 taels. Afterwards, market sentiment eased. Zhengjin absorbed the July contract at 10 pence 625, Huashang Bank absorbed the June contract at 10 pence 5625, and Mitsui and Mitsubishi traded at 10 pence and a half. After 11:00, it rose to 15 taels and 4 qian, but the closing price at noon was 513 taels and 7 qian.</p>
<p>Afternoon Closing at 508 Taels: The afternoon session opened at 512 taels and a half, then rose from 12 taels to 14 taels and 2 qian due to the decline in the Indian exchange rate by 6-7 ounces. After 2:30, it declined slightly by 1 tael. At 3:00, news spread that a certain bank's shipment of cash had been rejected by customs, preventing export. Consequently, large firms such as Xinhang and Taixing aggressively sold, causing a sudden drop of 6-7 taels. After 3:15, it was 507 taels and a half, then rose by 3-4 taels. Due to the constant selling, the trend remained weak. At 4:00, it was 507 taels, 7 or 8 qian. Afterwards, there were occasional fluctuations of 1-2 taels, and the exchange market also weakened. The closing price at 4:30 was 508 taels. The maximum price fluctuation for the day was 20 taels, and the minimum was 1 tael, a difference of 19 taels. The posted price fluctuated by over 27-28 taels. The book prices for the June/July contracts were 514 taels in the morning session and 508 taels in the afternoon session. Due to the excessive fluctuations, there was a double settlement price. The water compensation was 516 taels in the morning and 510 taels in the afternoon. Early morning items opened at 21 taels, closed at 13 taels at noon, 11 taels in the afternoon, and closed at 08 taels and a half.</p>
<p>Dalian Firms Bought Approximately 10,000 Bars: In terms of trading by various firms, Taixing, Taifengcheng, Shunli, Wanxing, Cuitai, Xiangyu, and others were buying, while Yuanmaoyong, Chengfengyong, Yucheng Yong, Jiutai, Fuchang, and Yu Da were selling. Hengxing and Yuantai and Dadecheng had occasional inflows and outflows. In the afternoon, Xiangyu, Fuchang, Xieyu, Wanxing, and Shunli were buying, while Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Yuansheng, and Yu Da were selling. Hengxing was buying. Dalian firms bought approximately 10,000 bars and sold approximately 2,200 bars. Guangdong firms made up for 1,000-2,000 bars, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Large Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants Dump English and American Contracts</p>
<p>Excessive Trading in Japanese Gold, Transactions Become Dull</p>
<p>No Changes in Listed Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver markets in England, America, India, and other countries all declined again. However, the markets in Yokohama and Kobe remained stagnant. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) listed prices remained unchanged. However, the English, American, and Japanese exchange rates showed significant changes within the banks, with chaotic and unpredictable fluctuations. This was due to the extraordinary changes in the gold market, which had been rising for five or six days before suddenly reversing. It had broken through 510 taels, with daily fluctuations of nearly 20 taels. However, the exchange rates did not show such drastic movements. Chinese speculators and gold dealers tended to sell to make contracts, with English gold trading volume reaching approximately 300,000-400,000 pounds. Banks still had strong demand. American gold also sold for approximately 1 million yuan. However, due to the significant difference between the bank's buying and selling prices for Japanese gold, no purchases were made, with only several hundred thousand yuan being sold. Banks such as Hefeng and Sumitomo absorbed slightly. Compared to the previous day, English exchange increased by 0.375, American exchange increased by 0.8125, and Japanese gold decreased by 0.01625. Market sentiment was extremely chaotic, and market conditions were unpredictable.</p>

<p>The yarn market remained weak and continued to show signs of decline. This was due to the unfavorable overall situation, weakness in overseas yarn markets, a sharp decline in the price of Three Grades Yarn, and softness in the American cotton market. Due to lack of sales, the local market was somewhat affected. However, buyers held on tightly and remained calm. Outsiders, seeing the stalemate, also refrained from taking action, leading to a lack of new transactions. Currently, the market is temporarily trending sideways. However, future developments are difficult to predict if the American cotton market changes or the war continues indefinitely.</p>
<p>Human Bidding Follows the Decline of Three Grades Yarn: The opening of the futures yarn market was uneventful. There were fewer buyers in the market. The second and third rounds of bidding were influenced by the decline in Three Grades Yarn, and sentiment eased. Prices for all months fell by 2-4 qian, except for the distant months.

<h3 id="e211">Silk and Tea: Silk Sales Stalled Due to Continued Shrinkage in Exchange Rates <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market continued to be stagnant. This was due to the further dramatic changes in the gold market, with prices soaring. The exchange rates of all countries, except for Japan, generally shrunk, resulting in a lack of silk telegraphs being sent to Shanghai. European firms remained hesitant. The new and old silk markets were completely stagnant. The shipment of new cocoons to Shanghai gradually improved. Given the current state of silk sales by foreign firms, the outlook for the silk market is increasingly pessimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Declining Quality of Cocoons in Shaoxing <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, is a cocoon-producing region. Farmers regard sericulture as an important sideline and pay attention to rearing [silkworms]. In recent years, the abundance and quality of cocoons have surpassed other counties. There are as many as six or seven hundred cocoon shops in various regions. Every time cocoons are available, it is a grand occasion. This year, due to the unrest in various counties, the number of silkworms raised has been greatly reduced. Few cocoon shops have been rented out. After the silkworm farmers collected the eggs, the weather changed erratically, with sudden cold and heat, and continuous rain. By the time of the great sleep, the climate was still unfavorable, with thunderstorms and sweltering heat, and oddly cold yellow sand. This resulted in widespread silkworm diseases, with almost all local varieties being abandoned. Only the foreign varieties were relatively better. New cocoons are gradually entering the market. The statistical cocoon production in each county is less than 50%. The number of cocoon shops opening is less than 20-30% of previous years. The cocoon price is 40-45 yuan. High-quality goods are also only 50 yuan. Xiaoshan Dongxiang collects cocoons mostly with paper currency. Nanyang has not yet opened cocoon shops due to the famine, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Key News from Tea Markets in Tunxi, Wu, and Zhang <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Tunxi New Tea Opens: The Tunxi tea market has recently become lively. All the shops along Yanghu Main Street have been rented out. Coarse tea opened on the 11th. High-grade [tea] is selling for 80 yuan, medium-grade [tea] for 68 yuan, and low-grade [tea] for 56-57 yuan. Tea prices are similar to last year. However, the harvest in various villages this year has been greatly reduced, and the price of rice is high. It is difficult to expect the market price to be low.</p>
<p>Standoff Between Firms, Few Openings: After days of negotiations, the new tea in Wu County is difficult to trade, as there is disagreement between the firms and they don't wish to compromise. Only the Shui Tea in the South Rural Area opened yesterday, with each load setting price at 65 yuan. Wucheng tea firms have been advancing the high-grade tea bought from Dexing, over a hundred loads, and price-point at 60 yuan. The rest are still in mutual consultation. Major merchants have been in a standoff for a few days. The firms in Shanghai have said that the news from the overseas tea market is bad, and have been advising not to procure excessive amounts, but the tea procurers have not been weakening. Thus, many merchants have sent tea specialists and clerks to take care of the business, and there are people going to Fuliang and East/South Rural Area to purchase, so the price of tea in Zhang Mountain will be difficult to suppress.</p>
<p>Zhang Mountain New Tea Begins Harvesting and Production: Zhang Mountain Green Tea, in the north of the county, is the highest grade in Wuyuan. The quality of the leaves and taste are unparalleled nationwide. Every time new spring tea is produced, merchants rush to order goods. Zhang Mountain tea is located on high mountain peaks, with a cold climate. The tea buds develop slowly. In recent months, it has been warm and rainy, and the growth has been faster than last year. The mountain residents are preparing to open their gardens and will begin harvesting and production within days. According to the mountain residents, due to its high location, Zhang Mountain tea is uniquely able to obtain morning dew and is delicate and fragrant. It is not like the loose tea produced in the plains.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Suian Green Tea Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm tea market in Shanghai was increasingly quiet. There were no transactions in Zhenmei Green Tea from native firms. Over 1,600 boxes of tea from Wenzhou had arrived, but the new price had not yet been announced. Over 100 boxes of Hongkou Black Tea were listed yesterday, but no deal had been reached. The new tea market is so quiet that it is heartbreaking. Yesterday, new samples of Zhenmei from Suian arrived at Chikaiyong and Rendeyong tea stores. More shipments will continue to arrive in Shanghai within days, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Grain: Rice Market Returns to Calm <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Sales are Sluggish…Imported Rice Becomes Weak</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the supply from the mainland remained scarce. However, the river inventory did not decrease. Market sales suddenly stalled. High-quality North Firm white japonica rice was also neither good or bad. Due to slow sales, stores were hesitant about average-quality Zhongguan rice. The price went from firm to stable. There were even fewer inquiries for old crops. Finally, it became weak and sluggish. There were few sales of Bo Dao rice, and the price remained unchanged. Suddenly, news spread that there would be a large supply of imported rice, causing stores in this area to stop sales, and the market stalled. Changes in the market were immobile, because they disliked how high priced the rice was. Diminished sales of inferior quality rice. The market situation for White Yuan rice was ordinary.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: There was not much supply from the river. The sales of Changxi North japonica rice were sluggish. However, high-quality goods were active, and the price still needed to be 20 yuan outside the customs. The Tong-grade machine rice market had fast sales in the morning and became stagnant in the afternoon. Due to the price increases in Zhabei the day before, the market was initially brisk but soon became sluggish. The price remained firm. The situation was the same for South Firm Bo Zao Dao and Yang Du Jian rice. Due to the stoppage of imported rice, it was difficult to sell the rice and change the circumstances. White Yuan rice sales were minimal, and the price was weak.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Recent Empty Squeeze in Flour Market <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Jumps Up by One Fen and Seven and a Half…Distant Months Also Lifted</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market suddenly soared again. The empty squeeze situation seemed to be ripe for the picking. In the lean season, the market usually has no regular pattern. If you want to maintain stable prices, it depends on the adjustment of the manufacturers. One side tries to produce as much as possible to meet the demand, and the other side tries to reduce speculation to avoid hoarding goods. If the standard is squeezed up, the spot price will naturally rise. At a time when the cost of living is high, the burden on ordinary people will inevitably increase. Therefore, suppressing prices is the responsibility of the manufacturers. (It is said that the empty squeeze bulls have 500,000 bags in hand.) Distant months were also slightly lifted due to recent months, but the comparison was minimal. Regarding the exploitation of the May contracts, the five and a half qian per contract mark is still perceived to be at the lowest range. As a result, the May contracts increased by 1 fen 7 and a half compared to the day before, June increased by 7 and a half, August increased by 2 and a half, September increased by 5, and October remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Wheat Market Momentum Difficult to Sustain <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market generally showed a fluctuating pattern. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat recovered by about two or three points, the recent exceptionally good weather has greatly benefited the prospects for the wheat harvest. Therefore, although domestic buyers are still resisting prices as usual, the overall environment makes it difficult to sustain further increases. As a result, the price for July was slightly better by one point, August was down by a slight point, and June and October remained unchanged. Currently, after the recent short squeeze on flour, traders seem to be contemplating speculative hoarding. This situation appears to be self-inflicted by the manufacturers. The asking price for delivered goods improved by two points compared to the previous day. Medium-grade goods remained stable. The opening price for wheat from Bengbu and Xuzhou was five taels, one mace, and two fen; wheat from Hankou was four taels, six mace, and five fen. A total of 2,300 bags were offered, which were reportedly purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Piece Goods - Sales Slightly Brisk <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>The factory's sixteen-pound coarse cloth saw no movement from northern merchants, and inventories of brands such as Five Cranes, Five Old Men, and Double Elephant all fell by five points. Eleven-pound cloth was slightly firmer. Yesterday, merchants from Shantou and Xiamen bought over 150 pieces of brands like Three Deer, Three Cats, and Four Plain Lotus. Some transactions also occurred on this street. Three Deer and Three Cats were both priced at four taels, five mace, and seven and a half fen; Four Plain Lotus was priced at four taels, six mace, and two and a half fen. Among fine cloths, only Caiqiu was declining, but yesterday, spot goods had become scarce. Blue Flying Fish required seven taels and two mace due to increased purchases from Niuzhuang and Tianjin merchants. Trumpet Boy opened at six taels, eight mace, and seven and a half fen, a rise of two and a half fen compared to the previous day. The Ningbo merchants, after a period of stagnation, gradually became active yesterday.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Piece Goods - Yesterday, sales showed a slight turnaround, mainly because the weather is getting hotter, and there is a sense that summer goods cannot be delayed any longer. Eastern goods like printed hemp gauze, raw foreign gauze, printed crepe, and white crepe saw brisk sales yesterday, with many transactions occurring on this street. White crepe opened at three taels, five mace, and five fen for Yin Pan, and two taels, nine mace, and seven and a half fen for Ren Gou. Banana Leaf Title Book Fine Stripe was at three taels and seven and a half fen. Prints were all sold at around two taels and four mace. Raw Straight Tribute Serge saw renewed interest from Hankou merchants, with Double Boy Deer at two mace, three fen, and five li, and Mount Mogan at two mace, six fen, seven li, and five hao. Fine cloth sales were quieter, with Signal Corps selling at eight taels, seven mace, and seven and a half fen; Moon Goose at eight taels, seven mace, and two and a half fen; and World Music Black at seven taels, seven mace and a half. Among Western goods, checkered hemp gauze was the most popular, priced at around two mace and four fen. Zhuluo gauze from Ruikang was at five mace and two and a half fen, and Taihe goods were at three mace and seven and a half fen, also with some transactions.</p>
