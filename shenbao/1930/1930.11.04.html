<h3 id="c76">國貨醬油之危機 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>洋洋醬競爭國產勢將消滅</p>
<p>立法院現提議設法救濟</p>
<p>醬油原爲吾國特產質味鮮美營養豐富爲普通人民日用必需品國内產額爲數甚鉅近因日本提倡改良醬油培養微菌精密研究竟已逹到縮短釀造時間改善品質之目的加以日本政府百方獎勵旣减輕其鹽價又特免其造石税成本驟輕製造又精以是積極向外發展大宗出品紛紛輪入吾國而英葡俄法醬油亦源源而來國產醬油原爲調味珍品者今竟一落千丈有漸歸消滅之勢推原其故實由鹽價太昂銷路阻絶洋醬通銷三大原因前經熟悉醬業内情之鍾履堅君著文警告已引起國人之注意現立法院亦提議設法救濟茲節錄提案如下願當局注意及之也</p>
<p>（醬爲百貨之一全國通銷向無地域之限制不幸民國五年蘇五屬鹽商爲勒銷引鹽起見向鹽務當局運動訂立醬坊進鹽售鹽單行規則六條藉以勒配貴鹽限制醬油之競資甲地製醬用鹽不得向乙地購入此處製成之醬更不許銷售於彼處然此項規則僅限於蘇五屬地方民國十二年兩浙鹽運使署又有醬油通銷僅以五十斤爲限之令文無非使鹽商逹到勒銷貴鹽之目的十八年又减爲十斤是江浙醬油已無自由競賣之可能其後長江各埠巡緝機關誤解江浙醬坊進鹽規則對於醬油出口及運銷各地者亦扣留處罰所謂牽一髮而動全身以是國產醬油不能自由運銷洋醬進口反得暢銷全國實爲目下提倡國貨運動中之一種畸形表現深堪注意惟自由競賣爲一般商品必具之條件改良品質乃自由競賣應有之結果循環相因而工商業始有促進發展之機會故今日國產醬油之衰</p>
<p>落即不能通銷之結果耳</p>
<p>造醬用鹽在歐美各國列入實業用鹽或减稅或免税其惟一之宗旨在减輕其成本促進其改良以便向外發即就東隣日本而言食鹽設局專賣税率頗高以前造醬用鹽旣受高税之影響復有造石税之重徵迭經全國醬商之呼籲實業界之抗爭乃於大正十五年將醬油稅則完全廢止此後日本醬業始得减輕成本向外發展執亞東之牛耳我國醬坊用鹽税率奇高如蘇五屬醬坊用鹽毎担配價爲十一元七角五分兩淮高税區域更無論矣此外尙有缸捐照費等項造醬成本遂年激增因是新法及新製造機械凡可以促進品質减輕成本者均無由舉辦坐視外國釀造業之突飛猛進一日千里長此以往國產醬油必致遂漸消滅</p>
<p>國產醬油旣受重税之累復有地域之限製造則無由積極改良出品則不能自由販賣捉襟見肘岌岌不可終日遑論對外發展因之洋醬乘隙而入通銷全國查海關報告冊近年普通醬油進口凈數估價爲四百六十萬零二千一百四十七海關兩沙士魚子醬及其他調味品進口凈數爲二千一百餘萬兩爲數之巨已可驚駭（民二至民十七統計）其偷漏入口者尙不可勝計且輸入量遂年增加而最近三年已增加一倍各國進口數以日</p>
<p>本爲最多英葡次之俄法又次之再比較各國普通醬油進口凈數更可證洋醬油衝銷中國奘况巨額輸入係由大連上海安東膠州天津拱北九龍瓊州各關轉運内地分批銷售舶來品旣衝銷全國國產醬油之消滅恐僅爲時間問題爲救濟計工商及財政當局亟宜恢復其通銷减輕其税率當機立斷俾得改良出品振興實業藉保國產而塞漏巵）</p>

<h3 id="c108">工商會議第三日 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>昨日第二次大會討論第一組報告</p>
<p>通過兩案再付審查兩案併案一件</p>
<p>通過（一）國内工商業聯合進行案（二）禁止廠砂礦鐡出口案</p>
<p>｜今日上午審查｜下午第三次大會｜</p>
<p>發展我國工商業的方策　朱通九</p>
<p>農工商之業爲一國經濟組織的基礎三者鼎足而立不可傷廢設該國天產豐富固須利用其天然富源使農工商三業同時發成如美國是設該國不幸限於地面的狹小當就其該國之特長而使之貨殊的發展以彌補缺陷如英國是此爲應用經濟學上的原則恐無人敢出而否認之</p>
<p>我國地大物愽天然當源豐富就原則而論農工商三業宜同時發展矣然揆諸事實則大謬不然以言農業則糧食恐慌時頻耳鼓今歳客米之入口動以百萬石計以農業立國見稱於世的中國糧食一項竟仰給於外國言之可憐亦復可笑茲姑捨農業而言工商則工商業之不振如故蓋以言乎上市場上外貨充斥國貨寥若晨星我國巿塲幾盡爲外貨占據毎年我國經濟上之損失何啻以千萬計以言乎商金融大權固爲外人所操縱即通商大埠進出口業大部分亦爲洋商師支配中國商人不過任差遺之責而食其餘羹耳何商業興盛之足云</p>
<p>今者全國工商會議業已開會著者以見聞所及將發展我國工商業的方策略製一二以供我國工商巨子之參考請詳述如左</p>
<p>一·保護關税政策我國關税因受不平等條約的束轉不能自立者有年矣我國國内幼稚工業之受外人摧殘即由於此目下雖能實行關税自立而税率仍由恊約决定不能謂完全之自由故欲保護國内幼稚工業仍爲事實上所不許設今日欲圖工業的發展非實行完全的關税自治不可此其一除掉保護之方法以外我國政府又非獎勵國貨輪出不爲功獎勵之法維何即商界巨子虞君洽卿所議之（免除國貨出口税入手並撤消洋貨免税及照税辦法）一則减輕國貨成本傳易於國外巿塲愓銷二則洋貨價格提高在國内减少其銷路法良意美一舉而兩善備焉此其二</p>
<p>增高使工業出品的成本增加結果使物價提高銷路受其影響因以消費者的地位觀之洋貨製造精良其價格與國貨相差無幾莫不　於購買洋貨於是國貨因價高而不易銷售故内地雜捐的繁重直接足以使工業品成本提高間接足以使價格提高而蒙不易暢銷之損失無情的内地雜捐宜酌量免除</p>
<p>三交通事業的提倡與道路的建設我國交通不甚便利爲國人所共知而交通事業亦不能稱爲發逹故内地貨物（原料品）不易運出以供各工廠應用因是在内地有棄貨於地之怨在工廠有缺乏原料供給之嗟在此種麻木不仁的狀態之下工商業焉能發展此其一内地原料品旣不易運出内地人民之購買力低當然無力向外購買工業品因之影響國貨之暢此其二交通事業旣不發涶交通宜然不甚便利運貨自必甚高即勁爲其難運輪一部分工業至内地其價亦必昂貴生活低廉的内地農民何能具此購買力而能購買耶此其三具此三因工商業中心之工業品固不能運入内地銷售而内地之原銷不能運外供給工廠應用實爲　工商業前途之阻礙免除此種阴礙之惟一方法厥爲提倡交通事業與建設道路四提高勞工待遇防止工潮發生近年工潮澎湃罷工時傳耳際揆厥原因由於勞工待遇過低發生生活問題鄙意與其因工潮而使出產減少毋寗提高待遇使生產效率增加傳工業方面盡生產的能事而商業方面亦得買還有無工商業的興盛頼此實多五·扶植國内原有的工業以防外商的侵占與兼併國内原有的工業因範圍小而資本少時被資本雄厚之洋商營業範圍的侵占或兼併如火柴業一項瑞典商人以雄厚的資實以其托辣司兼併之手段我國火柴業前途汲汲可危愚意原有工業急宜保障與維持其救急之法中國工商管理協會會員劉鴻生君提出同業歸併經營辦法實可補救其辦法工商管理協會或不久宣布茲不復蝥</p>
<p>六·肅清匪患近年中國内地匪多如毛旅行不便商賈裏足實爲我國國内商業前途一大障礙愚意爲發展國内商業起見中央政府軍事　束以後實行清鄉肅清匪共以冀免去障礙舉辦與否固責在政府而請求之責實在工商會議</p>
<p>七·工商界的保障民國成立以來國内固無一年無戰事而戰事發生的前後戰費的來源大半來自工商界蓋戰事术發生以前工商界擔仟一部軍費戰勝固佳而戰敗就地勒索一掃而空新軍開到以後又須　欵準備歡迎如是一而再再而三工商界資本焉得不告饋乏加以戰事告終地方受揖巿面蕭條工商業焉得不衰落　此其一近年國内之大患患在多后兵兵多則籌餉困難故各軍在駐地籌餉者所在多有工商業規模較大者常受丘八先生的光頋故不論大小工廠與商家幾無不焦頭爛額此其二綜計上述二種情狀均爲工商業發展前途的致命傷愚意中央政府應籌善後之策以作工商界之保障總計上述（一）（二）（六）（七）四項責在政府（三）（四）（五）三項責在工商界自身深望工商會議設法以善其後則我國工商前途庶幾有豸</p>

<p>六月一日西班牙名作展與日晒現代畫展</p>
<p>川合玉堂小室翠雲山内多門等是學南宗的荒木畝山元春舉堂本印象則爲純粹之院體小崛　音　木清方算是正則的日本畫然亦不過厚施粉彩竊唐人之末技耳就宣傳　術而言他們的努力而眞率誠懇的態度是值得我們佩服的從作品内容的意義講來即很淺薄惹厭表面的美麗輕浮的態度似那飄浮在春天的野花上的胡蝶一樣聽説這一次到意大利開會他們的政府撥了一筆巨欵富豪大倉喜七郎也捐出十萬美金並請作家橫山大觀偕同了十幾個門人親到羅馬酬應可見得這是日本人很注意的一件大事他們是以對外宣傳文化而抬高國際地位而擺着所謂世界五大强國之一的架子毎年他們在巴黎開會倫敦開會終是這樣十二分的誇張説到這一步我就不禁學着廚川白村的氣説口</p>
<p>日本人總想到處屑了美術擺架子然而在日本不是向來就沒有眞的畫嗎不是也沒有眞的雕刻嗎其似乎繪畫似乎雕刻的東西都不過是從支那人得來的外來思想其實是借貨是改本要發出澈底地努力和文化來則相當的生命力和根基都不夠只好小伶地不能幹地像蝴蝶那般飛出去眩人</p>
<p>啊你原諒一點罷他們的花盆裏沒有泥土呀然而歐洲一般人終竟是上騙了你聽我們到歐洲各處去旅行不論談美術談文學終是推舉日本人來着做東方的代表的他們的心目中自然是絕無中國的半點影子除非極少數極少數的專門學者才知道東方的文化的淵源在中國呀不要説了你廻頋我們的中國人自已又怎樣連這些小能幹小伶俐都沒有根本也不想上進更沒有趣味只知出賣祖宗的榮耀的遺產而絕無反省全然是墮落</p>

<p>先注意及此漸漸養成四民平等參政之習慣與經騐俾民權主義得以充滿實現（三）民生英士先生謂少數人生而多數人死不足以言民生惟欲謀多數人之生不能不要求多數人共向經濟建設一途猛進而經濟建設開步第一步走之</p>
<p>障礙即爲共產黨之煽動土匪之擾亂與夫團體間不規則之動作及軍政界不檢點之行爲是也此種障碍之除去政府當然應負完全責任而同時經濟建設之要素所謂爲疾用舒之道不能不望全民之共同努力夫爲疾者勤也用舒者儉也克勤克儉方足以言經濟建設否則一面怠於工作一面又競尙奢侈不獨民生主義離題太遠而影響所及將誘起世界各國之經濟侵略政策深入於全國而釀成全世界之不和平此則至可懹者也今日趁此英士先生紀念塔行落成典禮之機會又適値全國重告和平而精神最苦犧牪最鉅統一最後一幕之軍事已完全結束故不嫌詞費與諸位一訴其衷曲焉</p>
<p>現在代表介石主席致詞已畢本人要還原而爲黃膺白之談話前段代表致詞並非介石主席有電來告我之意然亦非本人一人之虚搆蓋參酌介石主席與英士先生結合之歷史及本人與介石主席平素之談論知其今日欲致之詞大致不外乎此何則民族主義之前提要全民有親愛精誠之精神而介石主席年來爲人題字常見其題親愛精誠）四字此可證明非本人之虚搆一也民權主義之前提要四民平等全國無特殊地位無特殊權力此層最近介石主席由戰地歸來在首都做紀念週時會慨切言之此可證明非本人虚搆二也民生生義之前提在除去經濟建設之障碍而介石主席定都南京後即着手清共此次戰地歸來後又注重剿匪此又可證明非本人之虚搆三也會記甲子之冬本人在北平擔任政治時介石主席由廣州拍來一電略謂（北方政局驟變弟豫料必有吾兄參加連日電報傳來消弭戰禍肅清故宫果係吾兄所爲聞之感而欲泣弟現正竭全力在廣州練兵務期國民革命之完成俾總理之主義可現英兄之遺志可伸則吾齊心跡方可大白於天下）等語故敢信介石主席對黨國之精神數十年如一日上海民衆當辛亥光復之時熱心贊世英士先生之處極多即有功於國家之處極多此層本人於五月十八日行奠基典禮時曾經詳細叙述希望英士先生之諸老友諸同志·及全上海民衆不改初衷以當年贊助英士先生之精神來贊助介石主席以完成英士先生（遵總理敎訓實現三民主義於中國）之遺志此則國家之福本黨之幸再者本紀念塔之建立有勞上海巿政府爲之贊助故能如期觀成又本日行開幕典禮蒙諸同志熱烈參加且有遠道惠臨者謹以極摯誠之熊度向各位一併道謝</p>

<p>威海衛一埠向來無華輪行駛航權旁落已久上海方面因英國在劉公島泊有軍艦在威駐有官臾又設有行號故太古怡和各派正式班輪往來行駛毎一個月中平均有十三四次開行今威埠已經我國接收素無船行之華北海岸現在有計劃開航之舉極將所聞分誌如下</p>
<p>英船停運郵件上海往威海衛之書信郵件因本埠之中國船無正班開往故郵局歷來托英商太古怡和等船承裝者今次英政府交還威海衛後英商太古輪等對於威海雖仍照開但郵件已經停裝矣刻下郵局方面對於運威書信等項</p>
<p>暂交非正班華輪運選　　華輪籌闢航路　威海衛已經我國接收招商局爲國營輪船公司現北洋船已派定新豐新銘兩艘行駛在威海衛一埠擬照太古怡和之華北航路亦添行威海衛之兼航線此事該局之營業科已在計劃祇以威埠素無分局對於貨運搭客等事擬設經理處而第一步手續則與郵局接治</p>
<p>招商請求補助　招商局爲開闢滬</p>
<p>威兼航班起見统盤籌劃以該處貨客較少先從接裝英輪停運之郵件入手該局營業科業已函致郵務管理局陳明由局承運寄威郵件要求照納運費之外另請郵局年貼補助費二千兩以爲營業上之挹注此函已經送出一俟復到即行進行開航事宜云</p>

<p>嚴厲取締以免受愚　　巿公安局稽查日前在法國郵船上查獲浙籍小販商人出洋經商所持之新嘉坡領署給發之護照年歲及情形不符且有移換相片情事當將該小販商人四名扣留帶局請究</p>
<p>破獲之綫索緣巿公安局自奉巿府轉到外交鄭嚴令取締小販出洋護照後以致各小販商人請照無門而出洋經商之心頗熱故四出請託以致原有之帶客（即包辦護照者）百計設法嗣悉粤省發照機關請照較易遂紛紛往粤巿府請領旋粤巿府以該商人旣係浙籍何不就近在上海請照乃不勞跋涉來粤請給頗起疑質曾咨請外交部詢問此中眞相一面停止發給詎各該帶客又探得南洋華岛·如新加坡檳榔　等領署給照更鬆遂購得五官端正洋裝呢帽之他人照片甚夥前往各該地領署請領毎張祇費洋七元（緣此項護照并非外交部頒發係臨時印刷之一張洋紙之照）迨領到後來滬兜售祇須年歲相當將原粘照上之相片撕下換貼買照者之相片及刋就之僞圓記故任何精細實難發覺朦混出洋者已不乏人此次巿公安局據人密報并負責指領往查得以破獲其隠</p>
<p>窮究買辦及藏黃魚者　巿公安局邇來迭接匿名信報告曾四出偵查因無綫索且若　小販商人願意出洋經商咸緘口不露自將搜獲之一人帶局發交第三科訊問始將隱情供明并訊以此照向誰人買得據供係高姓進派探往捕已逃逸無踪</p>
<p>滬上帶客皆逃自此案發生後此輩帶客聞得捕捉高某恐遭殃及相率走避蓋浙籍小販來滬待照出洋平日居住悉住於帶客所設之宇號棧房或匯兑莊（緣小販商人於出洋後購得之錢匯交該在轉匯回家絕不住其他旅社與客棧以故彼輩信息頗靈現聞巿公安局仍將該小販商四名拘押嚴密審訊中期逹徹底澄清除恶務盡之至意</p>
<p>護照與船票之價值　未取締前凡小販商欲出洋經商託帶客代請護照及船票每人至多二百二三十元如今因嚴緊轉往他埠請照每張有索至三百數十元猶爭先恐後</p>
<p>何以不從發照地乘船　緣香港新加坡檳榔嶼等埠購票乘輪須購三等票而至上海乘輪可購統票其船價較三等票要省十分之三四尤以藏黃魚無需護照更爲便宜但金錢能力充足者不肯冒險從事</p>
<p>此後之處置　聞巿公安局現正對於此種事務嚴厲取締務使杜絶以免無知鄉愚受騙而保公安云</p>

<p>— 漠野</p>
<p>濟南通訊</p>
<p>來濟二日陰雨連綿至威沉悶軍事消息無可報告民生疾苦則以缺乏數目字之統計材料亦難得具體之内容無已茲請談魯省幾個重要問題</p>
<p>一·匪患　魯省之匪患不自今日始而以戰後爲尤甚最著名者爲膠東及魯西與西南部此等匪徒出沒無常以曾經正式軍隊之承認到互相利用故器械亦甚充足官兵这力固不足言當肅清之責即剿除非易事以其性貭有時民團有時反得民心以抗官軍故根本解决乃绝不可能例如西南隅陽榖一帶薛傳峯所部曾經正式受晋方之任命委爲别動隊司令其人於魯之西南爲土著地方情形至爲熟悉事實上官軍絶難開至該地一帶欲剷除則頗威兵力缺乏同時對於客軍之調動亦頗不易例如膠東之劉珍年軍所部雖僅三萬之衆但經劉之嚴格訓練後戰力頗爲偉大惟欲其完全担任肅清匪患之責事實上絶難得劉之同意以是韓之部隧忽而東去忽而西開對於匪患乃有剿不勝剿剷不勝剷之概以是魯省雖已平定但匪患亦不弱於兵災也至於民衆間因匪患所受之損失官方旣無調查殉難作爲推論但省府日必接得匪警之報告乃係事實耳</p>
<p>二·財政　按照魯省十九年度这新預算全年收爲二千八百八十八萬七千零五十七元而支出據公布者亦適爲該數但收支中田賦項下計洋一千四百八十四萬七千二百零九元係以前所定之數目現則此項田賦早已爲以前軍閥預征省府如仍須保持此數則非效法前任纪繼績預備不可試問瘡痍滿目後之狀况人民有無此項担負能力且如正雜各税捐每年共計不下二百六十餘萬元此等捐税大都涉及苛細如果賢明政治開始則每年之支出數維持原狀勢非虧半數不可現時魯省之區域事實上可分三部一爲韓復渠所部中濟南魯中魯北一帶一爲劉珍年所部在膠東一爲馬鴻逵所部在魯南一部此數部分軍隧之系統旣不相屬一切行政均各自理税收機關更不待言故前述之收入總數尙須减去二部分其所入不敷所出明甚財政無辦法省政之謀整頓益成畫餠矣</p>
<p>三·侵略　魯省所受日人之壓迫殊不下吉遼兩省而最可懼者爲經濟侵略在青島之一切佈置固無所論矣以濟南一巿言其危機及可痛心之處尤多茲試舉二例一爲毒物魯省自韓復榘任主席職後對於烟禁需厲風行聞對犯者一經查出立予槍决日前有十三歲之幼童身懹烟膏查出後即遭極刑可見當局對於毒物禁絶之决心但當局僅能禁止國人販運私吸而不能杜絶日人之販賣以是禁者自禁吸者自吸貨價抬高徒日人私囊而已國人之受害者反變本加厲也二爲日人这當商據調查日人在魯省所設之當舖以濟南一巿而言即有五十餘家其發達之原因消極方面中國官廳不能保護華當商任令軍人騷擾卒致相率關門坐視日人起而从代之積極方面日人之經營是業毫不依吾國法律任所欲爲利旣優厚又無國人之競爭故其營業蒸蒸日上而五國人民則受最毒狠之剝削矣日人之營當業者通例利息爲十分過三個月即不能贖取而當價則又極低微往往所當之値較原價不及什之一如在月底當者則至下月一日明明爲二天期日商則照二個月算一切纠紛在當票上註明按照日本法律規定故遇訴訟其曲總在當者鄉民用現錢祇得忍痛上當無異飮酖止渴也以上所言者尙係極細微之事如果官廳能注意民間疾苦則尙非不能挽回也最可懼者當爲彼日人有具體大規模的經濟侵略計劃其詳非本文所能容俟調查後另爲文誌之</p>
<p>四·黨務　山東省之黨務與人民咸相隔離其情形無異平津及河此省而其干涉地方司法行政則有過之吾人不必專指在何時期始有此現象但已往魯省確有此弱點則爲事實按魯省全省黨員已登記及格者不過三四千人與全省民衆較不及千之一居民樸質雖剽悍但尙能服從如高級黨部領道有方魯省黨務最易進行同時亦必爲黨之一大援助無如已往之辦黨務者常自居於另一階級盛氣旣凌人而私德又多不自檢點以致墮失民衆之信仰心中央政府之政敵往往以此攻擊蔣個人或政府全體實則均受黨的不良影像所致也現時之整委會雖人數不足但主持之者尙知先派視察員去各地切實調查黨務狀况以爲將來整理之預備記者甚盼能於改弦易張之中與民衆謀切實之聯絡也　　　　以上不過舉其犖犖之四大端他如河務之極須整頓雜牌軍隧之切實取締軍額之减少苛捐雜税之免除預徴田賦之停止均爲救魯之要舉當局固應反省魯民尤宜起而督促政府行之也</p>

<p>— 問鵑</p>
<p>洋梧桐的落葉飄飄摇摇的下落在草地上十幾張休息椅靜靜地立着在期待牠們主人的來到</p>
<p>四點鐘的放課打過後一華女同學女同學們爭先恐後地跑進學校園手裏拿着各式各樣的絨缐團和剛在動手或者已經做到一半的背心和衣裳之類</p>
<p>她們找著了各人的座位便紛然就座那些得不着櫈子的又來擠着别人甚至三個人合一張的都有於是喧嘩和笑謔聲開始了</p>
<p>（你的背心眞不錯豆沙色配上的邊咦鈕子都釘上了也是豆沙色怪不得昨天放了學就找不着你原來是配鈕子去了密司脱A眞福氣啊）萍的話還沒有説完腿上已被人捻了一把她低低地喊了一聲（啊唷）</p>
<p>一張樹葉落在萍的頭髮上一個青蟲蠕從葉底下爬出和她同坐在一起的雯嚇得喊呌起來大家不知道什麽緣故都離座來看</p>
<p>(這有什麽可怕的)綽號猛張飛的瑩便伸手來捉她并且還賣弄本領似的故意把那蟲放在自己的鼻子上爬着</p>
<p>雯已跳到地當中去并且把面孔藏在兩隻手掌裏</p>
<p>那些(寄人椅角)的同學們趨此時機就把别人的地盤佔住</p>
<p>等到她們了結過一塲(蟲案)重復回到原位的時候早見那些取而代之的人在驕傲地笑了</p>
<p>大家鍳於這種走馬燈式的玩意兒太費力氣於是倡議坐到地上去一時手絹像蝴蝶似的翩然飛舞十來個人團圑然坐成圈子唱起歌來了</p>
<p>歌聲和骨針(咭咯)的細碎聲合成一片製成一種奇妙的音樂Ｖ大學的環境本來幽靜校園離運動塲又遠此時萬籟俱寂歌聲上徹秋空明凈的白雲也伸著頭靜靜地細聽洋梧桐摇擺着她的枝條發出蕭蕭的聲音與人們歌聲相應和</p>
<p>(倒讓你們快樂)椅子上的十幾張嘴同時讓着也來加入圏子於是她們的團體登時攏大而且變成椭圓式的了</p>
<h3 id="c224">黑背心－秋之新裝 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 冰攝</p>
<p>一時歌聲靜止背心的論戰又宣告復活</p>
<p>（性命要緊啊人家又不等穿這様地急法休息一下再做不好）</p>
<p>（什麽人家不人家是我母親的）</p>
<p>（哈哈老太太穿起綠顏色的西裝背心來了這是芹小姐新發明的時髦裝快點大家來看）猛張飛打著衣莊店夥計喝包的調子大聲唱起來</p>
<p>芹的臉紅著低了頭默默不語</p>
<p>還不打她一下嗎這大塊頭越來越淘氣了芹的鄰粉慫恿着</p>
<p>瘦面孔底芹和猛張飛扭作一團了格搭一聲骨針斷掉於是兩方面都有人出來拉勸力戰改成舌戰之後加入戰團的都想大展詞鋒將手中的活計也暫時放下</p>
<p>（難道結背心的一定是送給愛人各人家裏不許有哥哥弟弟穿背心）</p>
<p>（哥哥弟弟雖然有但是這背心會告訴我牠説是給某某的我也沒有法子替背心説誑）</p>
<p>（不要辯論等到穿的時候就有憑據了）</p>
<p>（不錯啊）少數人附和着</p>
<p>多數人的頭都低了一點不自然地用手去拔草</p>
<p>牆邊紅芙蓉的花像雲一般堆疊得眞是好看夕陽淡淡地照在落葉樹的枝頭彷彿向人們道晚安表示牠將要回去了小烏啾啾地呌着一陣西風卷起了落葉在空中飛舞少女們無邪的歡笑使這日暮的光陰也增加了一些快樂的意味</p>
<p>（明天還要考法文呢也不知道温温書儘著閙看你們怎麽得了）儼然師長的聲音倒把大家嚇了一跳留心一看猛張飛挺直子的樣子使得别人都笑灣了腰</p>
<p>（不要理她法文反正是T老頭的玩意兒不要緊的）</p>
<p>（可是也該去看看書了）坐在樹底下的萍提出了這一句同時身子也立起來一面拍土一面嘰哩咕嚕地今天只做了一寸天快冷起來幾時才完得了工眞討厭和你們這些小麻雀兒在一起她佯怒著</p>
<p>（是你剛才領著頭兒閙現在又抱怨别人了眞眞不識羞）</p>
<p>兩人都笑了圓形的陣地業已渙散大家紛紛立起心裏急著明天考試的人先走了剩下幾個最頑皮的又閙了一陣方慢慢地走著滑冰步向自修室方面而去</p>
<p>學校園的空氣頓時冷靜只有這些唖吧的休息椅永遠保守著她們方才談話的秘密</p>

<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>（二十）在中東鐵路俱樂部</p>
<p>早晨鷗和密絲朱來找我我還在睡夢中呢迷糊地爬起來我想一定又是到那裏玩了不過鷗此刻要舉行曅業考試想來沒有玩的空暇吧</p>
<p>(呵你還沒有起身快快快……起來起來密絲朱在外等着呢太陽底下她的皮膚要吃虧了)</p>
<p>(好我很快的那位密絲朱請她裏面來好了)</p>
<p>　(不要你快漱洗立刻就出去)</p>
<p>我也忘記問他究竟什麽事趕忙地披起衣服漱洗完了領結也沒有結就被鷗拉出去了</p>
<p>(這是密絲朱同學這是密斯特蘇—蘇來來我們先到前面咖啡店裏去吃一杯冰再走吧)</p>
<p>(什麽事呢這們忙你不是要考嗎)</p>
<p>(考好笑得很一清早我和密絲朱到Ｘ敎授家裏去考過了因爲我們今天補考)</p>
<p>我們在咖啡店裏據了一方桌子要了三客冰這様止住了鷗和朱女士的汗</p>
<p>(我們吃了去找凝秋向他要法大演劇的入塲券本來我以爲老謝有的誰知他沒有我想凝秋一定會有他的住所你知道吧)</p>
<p>(他仍就和長虹在一起呀)</p>
<p>冰吃完了於是我們乘電車去找凝秋</p>
<p>失望凝秋已經到法大去了留得長虹一個人在房裏抽烟我們只有分散了</p>
<p>……………</p>
<p>傍晚鷗又來了</p>
<p>(票有了走吧在中原鐵路俱樂部這地方想你還沒有去過你應該去一去裏面有一個大規模的劇塲而且還有許多書)</p>
<p>這次演劇本來是爲的振災我們這樣去看白戲眞不應當不過像我們這種窮人振災是眞辦不到了</p>
<p>(我們要去看的不過是凝秋導演的</p>
<p>戲呀)</p>
<p>(凝秋導演的什麽劇本呢)</p>
<p>(父歸據昨天凝秋對我説成績還好呢)</p>
<p>………………………</p>
<p>我們到了中東俱樂部了這俱樂的建築自然是哈爾濱所唯一的了劇塲裏四壁沿却裝飾了細碎的浮彫塲中央有一盞精緻的燈致於舞台上的一切也都很完備的有非常窵實的佈景燈光的變化也裝置得很完備</p>
<p>開幕了起初這些劇實在太低劣了有時會看到許多會使人作嘔的表演於是鷗領我到客廳裏去看書</p>
<p>那是幾幅名畫的臨摹技巧是很純熟的一張比較大的是畫哥薩克民族的故事另外幾張風景一張好像從英國某畫家的作品臨來的晝法都非常精細不過在燈光下而且懸掛得太高我不能群細去看</p>
<p>我們在沙發上休息了一下再入座接着就是父歸開演了</p>
<p>在開演之前有人報告給觀衆一些觀劇的規則因爲在先前幾　劇開演的時候座中是紊亂地嚷着的這樣觀衆們覺父歸這　劇也許是很認眞的了所以開幕後觀衆都靜止着</p>
<p>凝秋他不用舞台裏原有的很冩實的佈景只用幾塊黑布很簡單地襯在後面因爲燈光的緣故所以也並不覺得怎樣不妥</p>
<p>這劇本全劇的精神就在你親出場之後當那流浪的你親説(人一到年紀老了也就想起家了……唉我總想能夠掙這門一千兩千塊錢帶回家來……但是運命捉弄我就連那馬戲班的小房子也都燒啦)</p>
<p>以及賢一郞發怒地對他父親呌道(父親我就沒有有過你親過我完全是我自己創造出來的……你一個从無緣無故地闖進人家的屋子來要呌人喊你你親……)的時候觀衆中竟有在流眼淚的等劇完了鷗嘆息地對我説</p>
<p>(恐怕凝秋自己將來也要弄成這個你親一樣呵)</p>
<p>但是我却自己恐怖着自己倒有做成這個父親的可能呢</p>

<p>Currently Arranging Provincial Defenses</p>
<p>A business firm in Beiping sent letters to Zhao Pilian, Shang Zhen, and Ji Gongquan, earnestly requesting Yan Xishan to make a decision on his overall plans as soon as possible, stating that the general trend is irreversible and struggling is futile. If the telegram announcing his resignation is sent early, the central government's aircraft will not come north. Yan Xishan instructed that after the representative to Jinan returns with a reply telegram, he would hand over the troops to Xu Yongchang, and after properly arranging the provincial defenses, he would step down. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Recently, Yan Xishan of Beiping has once again deployed defenses in Shanxi. Li Fuying's 5th Army has been transferred to the Wutai and Mengxian area, responsible for defense from Renqingfengkou to the Great Wall Lingkou. Zhang Huizhao's 8th Army has been moved from Longquanguan to Datong. Wang Jingguo's 3rd Army has been transferred to the Yangquan and Shouguang area. Li Shengda's 4th Army is stationed in Jingxing, guarding the Niangziguan area, while the eleven counties in Hedong have been handed over to Guan Fu'an's forces, cooperating with Feng Yuxiang's Liu Ji, Pang Bingdong, and Liu Ruming. However, Yan Xishan's brain and stomach ailments have gradually worsened, and he requires assistance to move around. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping Military News (1): Yan Xishan issued an order starting October 25th that all vacant positions for military officers in all units would be suspended from filling, and those demoted would be reassigned to the same rank. Applications for review and approval would be permitted. (2): Zhao Chengzhou's cavalry unit of Shanxi is currently stationed in Guihua. (3): The 4th Cavalry Division, led by Tong Yubin, has dispatched two regiments to Datong. (4): Du Baoquan, from Chen Yaowu's unit, led a thousand men to join Shi Yousan. (5): Feng Yuxiang's entire unit, led by Liu Ji, has advanced into Shanxi. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang arrived in Beiping and demanded funds from Yan Xishan because the Northwest reorganization expenses and Feng Yuxiang's overseas travel expenses of 200,000 yuan issued by the Central Government this spring were retained by Yan Xishan and not distributed. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang is still residing in Jinci, and his troops have been handed over to Pang Bingxun as Commander-in-Chief. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yan Xishan in Beiping, due to the unfavorable situation and poor health, has decided to step down and go abroad. All preparations have been completed. He intends to entrust military affairs to Xu Yongchang and political affairs to Zhao Daiwen, and will travel to Japan with his family. The timing is very near. (3rd Joint News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Pan Yang - Yan Xishan's representative, Wen Shouquan, met with Zhang Xueliang on the afternoon of the 1st, handing over Yan's handwritten letter to Zhang and conveying Yan's hopes, stating that Yan currently commands 160,000 troops and Shanxi Province alone cannot support such a large army. He requested that the three provinces of Chahar, Shanxi, and Shaanxi still be used as defense areas for the Shanxi army. If they can be accommodated, Yan would step down, and as Zhao Daiwen is old, he intends to entrust the command of the Shanxi army to Xu Yongchang. Zhang replied that he fully understands Yan's true intentions and would convey them to the Central Government and mediate. Zhang immediately telegraphed Nanjing for instructions.

Therefore, the telegram was sent from Lingbao. There was a misunderstanding that Yang Hucheng was detained in Lingbao. In fact, the Ma Brigade had already occupied the provincial capital and Yang had also entered the province from Weinan. At the same time, Yang telegraphed Liu Zhenhua in Tianjin to welcome him. Liu replied that he would travel to Nanjing to meet President Chiang Kai-shek to discuss the powers of the Pacification Director's Office and request instructions on how to incorporate Feng Yuxiang's troops before proceeding to Shaanxi.

Because Shi Yousan has not yet returned, the various units are stationed in Wu'an, Daming, Shunde, Nangong, and other places, awaiting designated station locations. Zhou Guochang has established an office at Xinjiekou in Beiping. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - Lin Jiaxun, artillery commander of Shi Yousan's troops, previously captured four robbers. Two of the robbers have confessed. Yu Xuezhong telegraphed Zhang Xueliang for instructions to carry out the death penalty. The execution will be carried out upon Zhang's approval. The remaining two can be released on bail.

<h3 id="e12">The New Turkish-Greek Treaty and the European Situation <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>This time, Turkey and Greece were actually able to resolve the outstanding issues that had not been resolved in the seven years of negotiations in one fell swoop and sign the so-called new agreement, sweeping away all the disputes that had arisen from the Treaty of Lausanne and opening the way for future friendly relations between the two countries. It cannot be said that this is not a great success of Turkish-Greek diplomacy. However, a study of the principles of its success is not entirely due to the Greek Prime Minister's visit to Turkey, but more to the mediation of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Both Turkey and Greece have sent telegrams to the Italian Prime Minister expressing their gratitude, which shows that the ability of the Turkish and Greek authorities to eliminate old grievances and become friendly this time is indeed due to the great efforts of the Italian Prime Minister's mediation. The reason why Italy is willing to put forth its efforts to mediate is not without reason, but to show favor to Greece and Turkey. Therefore, the success of Turkish-Greek diplomacy can also be called the success of Italian diplomacy. Recently, Turkish newspapers discussed this issue, saying that this move will not only change the situation in the Near East, but also be of great importance to the whole of Europe and the world. This is not without reason. In recent years, the diplomats of various European countries have been using their far-sighted vision and their means of vertical and horizontal coordination to unite with countries in order to open up a new situation and seek their own peace and development. Therefore, there are often unpredictable new divisions and mergers in state relations. Italy has recently expressed sympathy for Germany and has also befriended Austria. Those who were previously regarded as enemies have suddenly become close to it. The divisions and mergers between them have attracted the attention of the world. Now Italy is mediating between Turkey and Greece, which means that Italy and Turkey and Greece are becoming more friendly. It cannot be said that this is the beginning of creating a new situation. However, the political situations in both Turkey and Greece have not been very stable recently. According to what the former dictator of Greece, Peng Jialu, said when he was captured, the conspiracy of this coup was due to seeking to abolish the new Turkish-Greek treaty, which means that there are still many opponents of the new union between Turkey and Greece. Therefore, it is still unknown whether the new union between Turkey and Greece can be permanent.</p>

<p>Nanjing Information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs The Soviet Union issued a telegram from Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting to Li Weinuofu, stating that the claim that Mo Dehui had full power to discuss and sign the issues of the China Eastern Railway, trade, and resumption of diplomatic relations at the official meeting in the Soviet Union was not true. Wang Zhengting only telegraphed Mo Dehui, saying that the three issues of the China Eastern Railway, trade, and resumption of diplomatic relations could be discussed in order, but not together. The resolutions of these three issues must be submitted to the government for approval before they can be signed. The content of the two telegrams differs greatly.

<p>Occupation of Maheibao Village</p>
<p>Lieutenant and Corporal Killed in Action</p>
<p>Aboriginal Leader Hanao Commits Suicide</p>
<p>Baigou Tribal Aborigines Exploited by the Japanese</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Taipei, 2nd: On the night of the 31st, the Maheibao and Bao Yalu villages swore an oath over blood and held a grand banquet around a bonfire. Furthermore, the He'e and Luotuo villages' aborigines, in order to counterattack the Japanese army reinforcements, ambushed the road. Japanese army laborers continued to flee, and the delivery of ammunition failed to materialize as desired. The military police are currently supervising and struggling hard.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Puli, 3rd: It is said that Hanao Ichiro and Jiro brothers, the masterminds of this aboriginal disturbance, invited the He'e village aborigines to a grand banquet two or three days before the uprising and explained in detail to the warriors and taught them how to operate new-style guns and cannons. Moreover, the aborigines withdrew all their postal savings a month ago to purchase food and clothing, etc., which shows that this rebellion was planned. Fifty-four chiefs from the Baigou aboriginal villages mobilized on the morning of the 2nd after the weapons were delivered to suppress the rebel aborigines.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Taipei, 2nd: At 5:00 PM on the 1st, the Matsui Battalion made contact with the Hualien Harbor unit, completely surrounding the Maheibao village and launching a general attack. The aborigines relied on the precipitous cliffs to defend to the death, with the distance to the Japanese army being only over fifty meters. Corporal Kotani of the military police supervised the coolies and had ammunition delivered to the front line fifty meters in front of the enemy.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Puli, 3rd: The last stronghold of the rebel aborigines, Maheibao village, was occupied by the Hualien Harbor troops at 1:00 PM on the 2nd and immediately set ablaze. At the same time, a small platoon from the 12th platoon dispatched from Taichung attempted to seize a high ground 1,500 meters south of the Dalaowu aboriginal village and engaged in close combat with the fierce aborigines. Two privates and one corporal of the Japanese army were killed and seven were injured. Furthermore, Lieutenant Araze Torao and Corporal Inatomi of the Hualien Harbor troops were both killed in action while engaging in a flanking attack before the occupation of Maheibao village. Because the fierce aborigines occupying the Maheibao village relied on the natural stronghold to fight, launching counterattacks from time to time, the punitive expedition used airplanes to carry large bombs and flares for incendiary plans. Also, the fierce aborigines often sniped from the shadows of mountains and rocks, which was extremely dangerous. The punitive expedition all wore iron helmets.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Taipei, 2nd: Hanao Ichiro, the central figure of the rebellion, committed suicide near Maheibao village on the 2nd.</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 3rd: According to aboriginal prisoners of war, most of the aboriginal tribes fled into the valleys, numbering 600, with two months' worth of food. Due to unfavorable weather, Japanese military aircraft were unable to scout.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Taipei, 3rd: According to a statement from the Police Affairs Bureau, the cause of the uprising in Wushe and two or three other aboriginal villages has not yet been clearly determined. However, the main reasons that can be inferred are roughly as follows: (1) The Wushe aborigines traditionally dislike being employed by others. When forced labor is unavoidable, they have women do it on their behalf. Recently, the authorities disregarded this custom and slightly increased the amount of labor, which seems extremely displeasing. (2) The police chief Zuo Zuka, who married a woman from the Hakek aboriginal village of Tuyue, received orders in Wushe as if he were being controlled by the Hakek aboriginal village. Therefore, the Wushe aboriginal village seems extremely displeased. (3) Mana Rudada, the chief of the Masheho aboriginal village, is an ambitious person who constantly seeks to expand his power. His younger sister had a physical relationship with a Japanese man in the 30th year of Meiji and was eventually abandoned, so he seems to constantly seek revenge.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd: According to recent official sources, since the Japanese soldiers attacked Wushe, about seventy or eighty rebel aborigines have died. However, the exact number is difficult to know because the aborigines always carry away the dead. There are still about 600 people resisting within Wushe. So far, a total of six Japanese soldiers have died and eleven have been injured. Six policemen have also died and one has been injured. One infantry battalion and some artillery have been transferred to the front lines to provide assistance. It is reported that the weather is extremely cold, and many soldiers are suffering from frostbite.</p>

<p>Reuters, Addis Ababa, 2nd: The King of Abyssinia held his coronation ceremony today, which was very lively. The place of the ceremony was a specially built church, the walls of which were not built to the roof, so those standing outside the church could also witness this grand ceremony. The king is of medium stature, with a moustache. A horse-drawn carriage exited the palace gate and arrived at the church. The carriage was pulled by six tall white horses. After entering the church, prayers were recited, and the bishop placed the crown on his head. The religion of Abyssinia is a type of old-fashioned Christianity. After the coronation ceremony, the king held religious ceremonies at the nearby St. George's Church, then returned to the palace to receive congratulations and greet the diplomatic corps.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Athens, 2nd: After being arrested, the former Greek dictator Pangalos told foreign reporters today that the driving force behind this conspiracy coup arose from domestic opposition to the Turkish-Greek agreement. He had nothing to do with the conspiracy but knew its contents quite thoroughly. Its intention was to seek the cancellation of the Turkish-Greek treaty. The majority of the people and many high-ranking officials in the country oppose this treaty. These high-ranking officials were also all aware of the conspiracy, but because the government wants to cover up the truth of the country's dissatisfaction with the new diplomatic policy, it dares not arrest them.</p>

<p>Elections Begin Today</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 2nd: The most important propaganda activities of the parties for Tuesday's elections in both houses have ended today. Broadcasting stations, in order to disseminate information and assist in the parties' propaganda, will broadcast the speeches of the party leaders across the country. Agriculture Secretary Hyde said that President Hoover has always been loyal to the Republican Party, but it is regrettable that the party has recently temporarily strayed from its path. Senator Norris, on the other hand, used the broadcasting station to fight for the position of independent Republicans and ordinary liberals, urging the election of progressive members of Congress. Senator Swanson echoed the Democratic Party, urging the public to elect Democratic personnel, saying that only this would provide an opportunity for construction and reverse the tide of unemployment. As for the Republican and Democratic parties, they insisted on not yielding to each other, each deeply believing that their party would win. The Democratic Party predicted that it could control everything in the House of Representatives with a majority of fifteen votes, and could also occupy more seats than other parties in the Senate. The Republican Party, on the other hand, while acknowledging that the strength of the two parties was evenly matched this time, believed that both houses would eventually fall into its hands. It is said that the outcome of this victory or defeat will largely hinge on the prohibition issue.</p>

<p>National Government Hires More German Military Advisors</p>

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 2nd: Regarding the Berlin news reported overseas that the Nanjing government has hired additional German officers to serve as military advisors in China, the authorities stated today that the wording of this record may mislead foreign inquiries into thinking that the Chinese side has requested assistance from the German Foreign Ministry. Therefore, it is solemnly declared that the Chinese Embassy has never discussed this matter with the German Foreign Ministry, and the German government's attitude towards this move is known both internally and externally, and there is no need to elaborate. As for the final section, which claims that the authorities believe that it may not be feasible to organize an army under such circumstances as planned by Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, etc., this is also entirely a misunderstanding. It should be known that the issue of whether the Chinese army can be organized has nothing to do with the German authorities, so they have never formally or informally considered or discussed it.</p>

<p>Important Domestic News</p>
<h3 id="e74">Central and National Government's Memorial Week <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, the Central Party Headquarters held the 84th Memorial Week. Members of the Central Committee Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Liu Luyin, Yu Jingtang, and other guests and staff of the headquarters, totaling more than 300 people, attended. Chairman Sun Ke opened the meeting and performed the ceremony as usual. Shao Lizi then gave a political report, saying in brief, "I followed Comrade Chiang to the front and left the capital for five months. Fortunately, the military campaign has ended, and I am very happy to reunite with my comrades. The most important military event of the past week was Yang Hucheng's occupation of Tongguan on the 25th of last month. He occupied Xi'an on the 27th. Tongguan is more than 300 li away from Xi'an by dry road. In general, people feel that since Yang Hucheng has occupied Tongguan, the recovery of Xi'an is definitely not a problem, but it will always take a considerable amount of time to achieve this goal. Although Song Zheyuan was defeated, his remaining troops still had some ability to resist. Moreover, Xi'an has high city walls and deep moats, and its architecture is extremely solid. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, Yang Hucheng defended Xi'an for eight months. The difficult-to-attack situation of Xi'an can be imagined. As for this time, the two famous cities were captured only three days apart from the capture of Tongguan. The momentum was like a broken bamboo. The difference between the difficulty and ease of the before and after is so great. There must be a reason for this. What is the reason? It is having doctrine versus not having doctrine. From this, we can know that the success of having doctrine and the failure of not having doctrine are even more obvious. However, although the Central Government has won the victory in this great war, it not only dares not be complacent or conceited, but also thinks about danger and fear even more. Why? In China's thousands of years of history, the records of successes and failures are unknown. Those who can permanently maintain their war achievements are actually very few. Moreover, it is common in history for those who become proud of their victory to fail shortly after. Therefore, the Central Government thought about danger and fear and decided before the war to fight for the survival of doctrine, not for personal gains and losses. After the victory in the war, when the doctrine had been consolidated, it first advocated peace in order to seek revolutionary construction. Furthermore, in terms of this great war, after five months, the Central Government's military strength and financial resources were more abundant than those of the enemy, and its equipment was more sophisticated. Moreover, with Commander-in-Chief Chiang's divine strategy and bravery, he was confident in military affairs, and it was impossible not to go through such a long period of time and sacrifice more than 100,000 people. The danger was not just once before victory could be achieved. There is a constant saying among the ancients of China that 'war is fierce and battles are dangerous,' which is not an empty saying. Therefore, those who experience a war must increase their education once. There is a constant saying in the West that civilized countries must increase their progress once after a war. However, looking back at our country's past history, each war only increases one loss. The ancient civilized metropolises and historical sites are destroyed by war, and the people leave their homes because of war. They are innumerable. After the war, thousands of years have passed, and no progress has been made. The reason for this is that they are content with the status quo and do not seek progress. This time, the result of the war is victory for doctrine. From now on, the government and society should all be united in awareness and strive for progress, changing the previous habit of complacency. There must be extreme progress in construction in order to maintain this lasting peace. In terms of military construction, in the past, swords and spears were used. Even if there were guns and cannons, they were all earthen medicine. Today, they are no longer suitable for warfare. Earthen music can only be used to make firecrackers. Although China can manufacture them, foreigners research and improve them every day. The guns and bullets made in China are still not catching up with others. If aircraft can also be manufactured in China, but without gasoline, they cannot fly. Now, China's gasoline must be purchased from foreign countries. If foreigners suddenly stop selling gasoline to China, not only will aircraft not be able to fly, but all kinds of cars will also have to stop. This is a very dangerous thing. We should think about not relying on people and quickly seeking independence. In China's past history, wars arose one after another like a revolving lantern because there was no so-called doctrine, so society was not concerned at all. The people's mentality has not changed until now. After the end of this war, people still say, 'It has been hard work for several months. Now we can take a rest,' as if war is commonplace and future wars are still brewing. This kind of mentality is the most obstructive to peace. Also, after this victory, there are various rumors, saying that a certain institution will be reorganized or that a certain person will be promoted. In fact, these are all speculations, and there is no such thing. This is also caused by old habits and is also a bad mentality. If an official's service is not appropriate, the government has the right to weigh and replace him. If he is diligent in his duties, he will be rewarded for his political achievements and will never be shaken. Just like when I was at the front, I heard rumors in the rear that someone was injured and someone was killed in action. I don't know where these rumors came from, but I can only laugh them off. Now that I have arrived in Beijing, I have heard rumors that someone will be promoted and someone will be transferred. People even ask me about it, but there is nothing to answer, which is really annoying. This kind of speculative mentality should be broken from now on, so that people's minds can be stabilized. The most regrettable thing I felt in this war was that the wounded soldiers were not treated well. The care for the wounded soldiers is entirely a matter for the rear and entirely a matter for society. In the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, the wounded soldiers were all treated by social organizations, who initiated medical treatment and nursing. Not only was medical material provided in full, but the nurses were mostly female students who personally took care of the wounded soldiers, giving them all kinds of spiritual comfort. Therefore, the wounded soldiers were happy to return to the front and were not afraid to die. In this war, the comfort of the wounded soldiers was only provided by the Lizi Society, with few people and many wounded soldiers, and the equipment was not complete. In addition, social organizations were not involved in comforting the wounded soldiers. Therefore, the wounded soldiers all ran away along the way after being cured and sent to the front. This shows that the lack of love among the Chinese people is the greatest weakness. There is also one thing that is enough to hinder peace, that is, the desires of the Chinese people are never satisfied. Shi Yousan is one of them. In the past, Shi commanded 20,000 to 30,000 troops and was often not satisfied. Later, he had 50,000 to 60,000 and was still not satisfied. Recently, he had 70,000 to 80,000 and still intended to not be satisfied. To fulfill his desires, even if there were more than 100,000 troops, he would still be unsatisfied. If you want to fulfill his desires, I am afraid that the country's financial resources and the society's material resources will not be able to catch up. Now Shi has been appointed by the Central Government and has been incorporated by the Central Government. This is not to criticize Shi intentionally. There is no shortage of people whose desires are similar to Shi's. Shi is taken as an example to generalize the rest. In short, China must leave military affairs in order to seek various types of manufacturing, such as how to improve guns and cannons, how to develop industry and commerce. After this war, all forces have become aware of it. After this, it should not happen, but the crisis with foreign countries is also hidden from this, and we must prepare for it before it rains. We must know that after the European War, the countries are nominally maintaining peace, but in secret they are each preparing their armaments. There will definitely be a greater war in the future that will be more fierce than the previous war. We should be aware of this as soon as possible and prepare for prevention." After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the same morning, the National Government held the Premier's Memorial Week. Zhu Peide, Ma Fuxiang, Jiang Menglin, Kong Xiangxi, He Yaoguo, Zhu Luhe, Wei Daoming, Lin Xiang, Zheng Hongnian, Chen Xi, Wang Jiazhen, Li Jinlun, Chen Yu, Qiu Ao, Wu Siyu, Zhou Yawei, and government civil servants and military staff, totaling more than 200 people, attended. After Zhu Peide took the seat and performed the ceremony, Secretary Qian Changzhao gave the following political report: (Shaanxi has been suffering from natural disasters and man-made disasters for years, and the people are not living well. Fortunately, Xi'an has been recovered, and the government has appointed Yang Hucheng as a member of the Shaanxi Provincial Government and chairman. Comrade Yang has worked very hard to suppress the rebels. Now that he has come out to preside over the provincial administration, it is deeply hoped that he will be able to save the people from the depths of misery. Shaanxi is full of bandits, and suppressing bandits is the first priority. It is imperative to restore social order and enable the people to live and work in peace. At the same time, the weather is getting colder, and disaster relief is also urgent. It is impossible to make the Shaanxi Provincial Government cook without rice. The government and the people of the whole country should do their best to help. As for the active aspects, all construction work should also be planned as soon as possible, because the development of the Northwest can start from Shaanxi. The so-called development of human and financial resources must be carefully prepared. This cannot be done in a short period of time, but we must pay attention to it now and carry it out. The bandit communists in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are still rampant. In the past, the central government was focused on suppressing the rebels, and the bandit communists were able to survive. Now that the military campaign to suppress the rebels has ended, we should launch a large-scale encirclement and suppression to eliminate them once and for all. The central government is prepared and is moving east. In fact, the bandit communists are not only in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. In other provinces, they also openly occupy local areas or are lurking and harming them. The government has decided to carry out a large-scale cleanup. The cleanup is definitely not just empty talk, but more than a year has passed since the announcement of the Cleanup Regulations on September 18th, and there has been little achievement in this matter in various places, and there are even fewer detailed reports. In the future, we must take responsibility and implement it effectively. We must understand that if this matter is not done first, all construction in the country cannot be carried out. We hope that we will make special efforts. The Industrial and Commercial Conference was opened on Saturday and Sunday of last week. The scale is very large. In addition to the representatives sent by the central ministries and commissions and various provinces and cities, there are also appointed members and experts. Some of them have rich experience or have advanced knowledge. Gathering together, the ideals and facts will be considered when discussing various issues. There are many items to be discussed this time, and the issues of relieving unemployment, concentrating capital, coordinating labor and capital, and promoting and protecting domestic goods are particularly important at present. The policy should be decided urgently. It is said that there are three or four hundred proposals in total. It is not easy to examine and discuss them in a short period of time. Fortunately, there are many talents, so they can be competent. It is hoped that all the plans decided in the future will be implemented in order. The government will do its best in both negative aspects, such as eliminating bandit communists and abolishing exorbitant taxes, and positive aspects, such as facilitating transportation and promoting and rewarding industry and commerce. We also believe that the industrial and commercial sectors can absolutely cooperate with the government to establish a long-term foundation for the national economy.)</p>
<p>Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3 id="e75">Proposed Commercial Accounting Year <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The Hangzhou City Chamber of Commerce, in order to address the year-end accounting issues for businesses, convened a joint meeting this afternoon (the 3rd) of the chairmen and committee members of various trade associations. Attendees included Shao Yan, Wang Xiangquan, Jin Runquan, Yang Chunlai, and 36 others. Xu Xinggong was unanimously elected as chairman. Committee member Xie Hucheng and others presented a proposal regarding the establishment of a commercial accounting year. After detailed discussion by the attendees, it was resolved to submit the original proposal to the authorities, requesting the establishment of a commercial accounting year with the beginning of Spring, Summer Solstice, and Autumn Equinox as the accounting periods. It was also requested that the final accounting period for this year be extended to February 15th of the following year as a transitional measure. The original proposal is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>1.  It is understood that the annual final accounting for business bookkeeping should be conducted in accordance with the Gregorian calendar as determined and mandated by the Party and government agencies, which we merchants should strictly adhere to. However, Chinese commerce traditionally views the beginning and end of agricultural production as a cycle. The time when agricultural production begins is when funds are needed, and the time when it is harvested is when funds are repaid. In the past, the harvest of agricultural products and the repayment of funds occurred close to the end of the lunar year. Merchants therefore set the end of the year as the accounting period, which has become a long-standing custom. While the national calendar can be changed at any time and the public can be strictly required to comply, the natural processes of agricultural production, which are related to climate and seasons, cannot be shifted by human decree. The government's published calendars still predict seasonal changes and list them by month, demonstrating its emphasis on agricultural production and adapting to nature. Similarly, the government's establishment of fiscal years for state finances is undoubtedly intended to balance income and expenditure, which is also related to the processes of agricultural production. Otherwise, it could simply use the calendar year for accounting. The Chamber of Commerce, overseeing commercial activity, has received numerous requests from various industries to adjust the year-end accounting method to accommodate their needs. Merchants in other cities are also making similar requests. Given these circumstances, it seems inappropriate to ignore them. A standard method should be discussed and established to avoid a situation of "cutting the feet to fit the shoes" and to achieve a practical solution. However, the opinions expressed by merchants in various places often focus solely on immediate relief and do not address the fundamental issues. For example, proposals to extend the accounting period to the end of January or February 15th of the Gregorian calendar are understandable, but what is suitable for the present may not be applicable in the future, requiring annual changes and lacking permanence. Therefore, such methods cannot be considered appropriate. In our humble opinion, it is urgent to suggest to the authorities that a commercial accounting year be established, similar to the fiscal year used for state finances, to align with natural cycles and facilitate commerce. The start and end dates of this commercial accounting year should be based on the Gregorian calendar and align with the seasonal changes that are most relevant to the start and end of agricultural work. It is proposed that the annual accounting year begin on the day of the Start of Spring (立春) and end on the day before the Start of Spring of the following year. This approach would better balance national policy with agricultural and commercial practices, making it practical, easy to implement, and permanently established. Furthermore, in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, commercial practice dictates that funds are typically raised in the spring and autumn to finance the purchase of goods, known as "long-term loans." Traditionally, these loans began and ended in the third and ninth months of the lunar calendar (a period of six months). It is suggested that the Start of Summer (立夏) and Start of Winter (立冬) be used as alternative start and end dates (with the first period lasting 179 days and the second lasting 186 days). Moreover, the government currently sets the end of June, end of September, and end of December as quarterly tax collection dates, but in reality, most businesses face significant difficulties and may even use this as an excuse for delays. It is also suggested that these dates be adjusted to the Start of Spring, Summer Solstice, and Autumn Equinox. This would ensure that government policies and practical realities are aligned. Those who are law-abiding would not suffer unexpected losses, while those seeking illicit gains would have no excuse for procrastination. Consistency and permanence would be ensured. As this matter relates to the vital interests of commerce, we dare not remain silent. We propose that this matter be carefully considered and submitted to the Party and government agencies for selection and implementation. We have drafted a proposal and included a comparative table of the corresponding dates in the Gregorian and lunar calendars for the aforementioned seasonal changes over the past ten years for reference. This is submitted for public decision. (Attached table omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e76">The Crisis of Domestic Soy Sauce <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Foreign soy sauce is aggressively competing, threatening to eliminate domestic production.</p>
<p>The Legislative Yuan is now proposing measures to provide relief.</p>
<p>Soy sauce is originally a unique product of our country, characterized by its fresh taste and rich nutritional value, and is a daily necessity for the common people. The domestic production volume is very large. Recently, Japan has been promoting the improvement of soy sauce, conducting in-depth research into the cultivation of microbes, and has achieved the goals of shortening the brewing time and improving the quality. In addition, the Japanese government has been providing various incentives, reducing its salt prices and exempting its brewing stone tax, which has sharply reduced costs and improved manufacturing. As a result, there has been aggressive foreign development, and large quantities of products have been imported into our country. Soy sauces from England, Portugal, Russia, and France have also been flowing in. Domestic soy sauce, originally a gourmet condiment, has now suffered a sharp decline and is in danger of disappearing. The reasons for this can be attributed to three major factors: high salt prices, obstructed sales channels, and the widespread circulation of foreign soy sauces. Mr. Zhong Lujian, who is familiar with the soy sauce industry, has already issued a warning in an article, which has attracted the attention of the Chinese people. Now, the Legislative Yuan is also proposing measures to provide relief. An excerpt from the proposal is presented below, hoping that the authorities will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>(Soy sauce is one of the many commodities sold throughout the country without regional restrictions. Unfortunately, in the fifth year of the Republic of China, the salt merchants of the five prefectures of Jiangsu Province, in order to force the sale of salt licenses, lobbied the salt affairs authorities to formulate six separate rules for the sale of salt to soy sauce workshops, so as to force the allocation of expensive salt and restrict the competition of soy sauce. Salt for making soy sauce in one place could not be purchased from another place, and soy sauce made here was not allowed to be sold there. However, these rules were limited to the five prefectures of Jiangsu Province. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, the Liangzhe Salt Transport Commissioner's Office issued an order limiting the sale of soy sauce to only 50 catties, which was intended to enable salt merchants to force the sale of expensive salt. In the eighteenth year, this was reduced to 10 catties. Jiangzhe soy sauce has no free competition. Later, the Yangtze River port patrol agencies misunderstood the Jiangzhe soy sauce workshop salt rules and also detained and punished those who exported and sold soy sauce to various places. The saying is that pulling one hair moves the whole body. As a result, domestic soy sauce cannot be freely sold, and foreign soy sauce is allowed to be sold freely throughout the country. This is a distorted phenomenon in the current promotion of domestic goods movement that is deeply concerning. Free competition is a necessary condition for general commodities, and improving quality is the result of free competition. They promote each other, and the industrial and commercial industries can only have opportunities for promotion and development. Therefore, the decline of domestic soy sauce today is the result of its inability to be sold.)</p>
<p>Salt used for soy sauce production in European and American countries is classified as industrial salt, and taxes are reduced or exempted. The only purpose is to reduce costs and promote its improvement, so as to develop it to the outside world. Even in neighboring Japan, where the salt monopoly bureau has a high tax rate, the soy sauce industry has been affected by both high taxes on salt and heavy tax on brewing stones. After repeated calls from soy sauce merchants across the country and protests from the industrial sector, the soy sauce tax laws were completely abolished in the fifteenth year of Taisho (1926). Since then, the Japanese soy sauce industry has been able to reduce costs and develop overseas, taking the lead in East Asia. The tax rate on salt used in soy sauce workshops in our country is extremely high. For example, in the five prefectures of Jiangsu Province, the matching price for salt used in soy sauce workshops is 11 yuan, 7 jiao, and 5 fen per dan. The high tax areas in Lianghuai are even higher. In addition, there are also tank donation fees and photo fees, which have caused the cost of soy sauce to increase sharply year by year. As a result, new laws and new manufacturing machines that can promote quality and reduce costs cannot be implemented, and we can only sit back and watch the rapid development of the foreign brewing industry. If this continues, domestic soy sauce will gradually disappear.</p>
<p>Domestic soy sauce is not only burdened by heavy taxes and regional restrictions, but also lacks the ability to actively improve manufacturing and cannot freely sell its products. It is in a precarious situation and cannot last forever, let alone develop overseas. As a result, foreign soy sauce has taken advantage of the opportunity to enter and sell throughout the country. According to customs reports, the net import volume of ordinary soy sauce in recent years is estimated at 4,600,2147 customs taels. The net import volume of caviar and other condiments is more than 21 million taels. The huge amount is already alarming (statistics from Minguo 2 to 17). The amount smuggled into the country cannot be estimated, and the import volume increases year by year. It has doubled in the last three years. Japan has the largest number of imports, followed by England and Portugal, and then Russia and France. Comparing the net import volume of ordinary soy sauce in various countries, it can be proved that the flooding of foreign soy sauce into China is a huge amount. The large amount of imports is transported to the mainland from Dalian, Shanghai, Andong, Jiaozhou, Tianjin, Gongbei, Kowloon, and Qiongzhou and sold in batches. Since imported goods are flooding the country, the disappearance of domestic soy sauce is only a matter of time. In order to provide relief, the industrial and commercial and financial authorities should immediately restore its circulation and reduce its tax rate, so as to improve its products, revitalize industry, and protect domestic products and prevent leakage.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Factions within the Jin Army <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>North China Correspondence: The Jin army units of Li Fuying and Wang Jingguo, which retreated west from Shijiazhuang, are now stationed along the Zhengtai Railway line between Huolu and Jingxing, with only a small number of scattered soldiers patrolling and lacking any defensive works. The majority of their troops have retreated into Niangziguan. Zhang Yinwu, Li Fuying, Wang Jingguo, Li Shengda and others are currently in Niangziguan. Yan Xishan has entrusted Zhang Yinwu with full responsibility for the defense of this area. However, in reality, Zhang can only command Feng Pengzhu's unit. The others, such as Li Fuying, who hails from Yan Xishan's hometown of Wutai County and is a core member of the Jinbei faction and Yan's confidant, continues to receive direct orders from the Taiyuan headquarters. Li Shengda, formerly under Fu Zuoyi, is a core member of the Jinnan faction. Wang Jingguo, whose seniority is above Zhang's, are not subject to Zhang's control. Therefore, if hostilities break out in this area, the Jin army may not be able to hold Niangziguan despite its strategic location, as discord among generals is a major cause of military defeat. The previous disastrous defeat of Fu Zuoyi and others in Jinan was due to this. (Currently, Fu Zuoyi remains in seclusion in the Tianjin concession, not daring to return to support). Traditionally, Shanxi generals have been divided into three factions: Jinnan, Jinbei, and Baoding. The Jinnan faction has declined significantly since the annihilation of Fu Zuoyi's entire army. Currently, the Jinbei and Baoding factions are in a state of tacit rivalry. However, the Jinbei faction is largely composed of people from the Wutai area, such as Yang Aiyuan, Yang Chengyuan (Yan's nephews), Du Chunyi, and Li Fuying (Yan's fellow villagers and neighbors), all of whom Yan has promoted as his most trusted. They are always positioned in the rear during battles and given priority when land is acquired (for example, Yang Aiyuan's appointment as Chairman of Chahar and Li Fuying's appointment as Commander of the Pingjin Garrison). They are always treated better than other factions, so the Jinnan and Baoding factions have often been dissatisfied, and their resentment has intensified after this major defeat. Yan's decision to entrust Zhang (Yinwu) with full responsibility for the defense of Niangziguan is intended to appease the Baoding faction and prevent division. At the same time, he appointed Zhao Chengshou as the Border Defense Commander, responsible for the security of the Yanmen area in northern Shanxi, and Guan Fuan as the Military City Garrison Commander, responsible for the security of eastern Shanxi. As for the allocation of troops, the remnants of Sun Chu, Yang Xiaou, Guan Fuan, and others, who retreated from the Longhai Line, are stationed in Hedong, Linfen, and Yuncheng. The units of the Jinbei faction are mostly stationed in Yanmen, Daizhou, and Datong in northern Shanxi, with Zhang Yinwu, Zhao Chengshou, and Guan Fuan sharing responsibility for the north, south, and east. The rumors that Yan has handed over military power to Xu Yongchang and Shang Zhen are not true. (October 28)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Shandong Provincial Government Vigorously Suppressing Bandits in Jiaodong <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Cao Fulin's troops march east.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuqu recognizes that the bandits in Jiaodong are constantly moving around, causing disturbances everywhere. He believes that pacifying the region requires a thorough suppression. Yesterday, he specifically ordered Cao Fulin, the commander of the 14th Army, to march east immediately to oversee the bandit suppression. All troops in Jiaodong will be under Cao's command. He also ordered one regiment of Zhan Shutang's 73rd Division, stationed in Weixian, to move to Gaomi, and one regiment to move to Jiaozhou and then to Zhucheng. Tang Yaoxun's brigade of Gu Liangmin's division, stationed in Jinan, will reinforce Weixian. One battalion of the 14th Army's pistol regiment, cavalry regiment, engineer battalion, and artillery regiment will depart with Cao Fulin. He ordered the Jinan Station on the Jiaoji Railway to prepare two trains to transport the aforementioned troops east, and the Weixian Station to prepare one train to transport Zhan's division to Gaomi and Jiaozhou. Today, Tang Yaoxun, the commander of the 65th Brigade, has already taken one train to Weixian. The remaining troops are being loaded onto trains. Qiao Lizhi's division, stationed in the Zhoucun area, will also be under Cao Fulin's command. Han Fuqu strictly ordered all troops to fundamentally eliminate the bandits in this operation, unlike ordinary bandit suppression. The Beiping armored train has already departed east today. Cao Fulin himself is scheduled to depart on the evening train today, accompanied by Chief of Staff Wang Shiqi and Chief of the Operations Section Su Erchang, and will establish his headquarters in Jiaozhou. Currently, the most rampant bandits in Jiaodong include Wang Sida's gang in Linqu, Hao Mingzhu's gang south of Fangzi Station, Wang Ziming's gang between Anqiu and Gaomi, and a gang in Pingdu. Each gang consists of 300 to 600 people and engages in arson, murder, kidnapping, and other evils. Telegrams requesting troops are flooding in from various counties, especially from Hongshiya in Pingdu. Therefore, the authorities have made this decision. It is said that after Cao Fulin arrives in Jiaozhou, he will begin suppression operations. In Jinan, only Li Hanzhang's 85th Brigade of the 29th Division of the 14th Army and Lei Taiping's pistol brigade remain to handle defense duties. In addition, Sun Tongxuan, commander of the 22nd Army, is currently overseeing bandit suppression in Wuding, and Rong Guangxing, commander of the 80th Brigade, is suppressing bandits in the Dongchang area. The situation in southern Shandong has been relatively calm recently. (November 1)</p>
<h3 id="e79">The Yanbian Incident Is Becoming Increasingly Serious <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>More than 500 Japanese police officers have invaded.</p>
<p>They carry weapons and roam the streets, causing alarm among merchants and residents.</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: After the Longjingcun incident, the provincial government requested the Yanji Garrison Commander Ji Xing to investigate and report the truth. Recently, due to the expansion of the scope of the negotiations, the provincial government, in accordance with the central government's orders, is unable to respond to the Japanese consulate independently. Therefore, it can only remain calm for the time being. However, the Japanese side is becoming increasingly aggressive. Not only have they refused to withdraw the police officers who invaded Yanbian, but they also dispatched more than 30 additional police officers from Huining, Korea, on the 24th of this month to invade the areas of Toutaogou, Helong, Wangqing, and Baicaogou. Large units of armed Japanese police have also arrived in these areas. In total, more than 500 Japanese police officers have invaded Yanbian, not including those originally stationed in various places. They carry weapons every day and roam the streets, using the pretext of searching for Korean communists to enter civilian homes and shops inside and outside the city. The residents are suffering from the disturbance. In Longjingcun, Japanese police officers patrol the streets all night with weapons. After 8:00 PM, the Chinese all close their doors and remain inside. As a result, the streets are almost empty of people except for the Japanese police officers coming and going. In order to avoid conflicts, Ji Xing's troops have withdrawn the sentries from the streets. Therefore, Yanbian has become the world of the Japanese. In addition to the armed police officers spread along the border, the Japanese side has also dispatched many plainclothes police officers to search the countryside, making it impossible for the villagers to live in peace. Starting on the 25th, the Japanese police in Longjing also implemented a system of inspecting the cleanliness of citizens, overstepping their authority and interfering in our internal affairs. Although the Commercial Port Bureau has protested twice, the Japanese have ignored them. (November 28)</p>

<p>The cases of Lu Shiqiao were tried on the same day. Lu Shiqiao, a citizen from Beishang Township, Wuxi, was arrested by the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau in the past for a counter-revolutionary case, and Lu Genhu, Zhu Aida, Guo Asi, Chen Aditi and others were arrested and sent to the High Court. After trial, Lu Shiqiao was sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment, Lu Genhu was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment, and Guo Asi, Zhu Aida, and Chen Aditi were sentenced to ten months of imprisonment each. All the convicts refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court. After the judgment, the High Court was sent back for a retrial. Lu Shiqiao and others were then accused of instructing the killing of Tan Qixuan and filed a lawsuit with the Wuxi County Government, which was immediately brought back to Wuxi for trial. In July of this year, Lu Shiqiao was sentenced to death, Bao Dayuan was sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment, and Zhu Aida, Guo Asi, and Lu Genhu were each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. Lu and others refused to accept the sentence and hired lawyer Wu Chao to appeal to the High Court. Yesterday (the 3rd) at 3 p.m., Zheng Chi, the presiding judge of the Criminal Second Court of the High Court, opened a court to hear the appeal of the killing of Tan Qixuan, and Zheng Zhiguo, the judge of the Criminal Third Court, opened a court to investigate the retrial of the counter-revolutionary case. Both courts believed that they had to summon witnesses for further trial, so they adjourned the court and ordered the convicts to be returned to prison.</p>

<p>Robbery and Assault in Yaowan Township: Residents of Yaowan Township, which belongs to the 17th district (Fuan Township), had a lavish wedding arranged for his son on the 23rd of last month. Unexpectedly, around 1 a.m. the night before last, seven or eight robbers wielding handguns and flashlights broke into the Bian family's right-side plank wall and barged into the bride's bedroom. They ransacked the room, restrained and severely beat Bian Jimei and others, causing injuries. The robbery lasted about an hour before they fled with their loot, which included a suitcase and a handbag containing newly made silk clothing, miscellaneous items, and cash, totaling over 200 yuan. The 14th branch of the Public Security Bureau was notified and immediately dispatched officers to pursue the robbers, but they had already fled and could not be apprehended.</p>
<p>Embezzlement by Stamp Duty Inspectors: Shao You-tang and Hua Yue-ru, inspectors from the Chengxi branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Duty Bureau, arrived at the Fulong leather shoe and suitcase store at the north end of Shuyuan Lane in the city around 3 p.m. yesterday to inspect for any unpaid stamp duties. The shop owner, Liu Xiyong, handed over all his account books for inspection. Shao and Hua found that four account books had stamps that they deemed illegal. (Note: Each account book should use stamps for two years. The stamps affixed this year are the current stamps, while the stamps affixed last year were those issued after the current situation became public and were previously in general use.) They declared that according to regulations, a fine of 40 to 400 yuan would be imposed. Liu Xiyong argued that there were no violations or unpaid stamps and offered to pay a fine. After some negotiation, Liu agreed to purchase seven yuan worth of stamps. Shao and Hua instructed Liu to send someone to the bureau to collect the stamps, but when the person returned, they only received two yuan worth of stamps. The remaining five yuan had been pocketed by Shao and Hua.</p>
<p>University Student Attempted Suicide and Rescued: Qian Zhexian, 24, the young owner of the Wansheng Pharmacy in Changzhou Yuncun, is a student at Soochow University in Suzhou and comes from a wealthy family. His father passed away early, and his mother is still alive. Qian has suffered from hemorrhoids (also known as anal inflammation) for years and has consulted numerous famous doctors without success. As a result, he dropped out of school last year and became depressed. He recently sought treatment at Baolong Hospital in Shanghai, but it was still ineffective, which further depressed him. He left home a few days ago, wandering around the scenic spots of Hangzhou, and sent a letter home saying that he was stimulated by the environment and would travel all over the country, making it difficult to determine when he would return. Qian's mother was extremely anxious after receiving the letter and immediately asked her relative Xie Nanxie, nephew Qian Jingchun, and friend Shi Xingda to go to Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and other places to look for him. On the 31st of last month, Qian Zhexian arrived in Wuxi from Hangzhou and stayed in Room 55 of the Qitai Inn on Tongyun Road, using the alias Ying Fu. He had already made up his mind to commit suicide. That night, he wrote two wills, one to his family and one to the inn's front desk. Yesterday morning, Qian locked himself in his room and swallowed three bottles of Midingna tranquilizer pills and went to sleep. In the afternoon, the inn's tea server noticed that he had not gotten up and became suspicious. He opened the door and saw Qian lying stiffly on the bed, his face pale. He then saw three empty bottles of tranquilizer pills and two wills on the table, as well as three yuan in cash. Realizing he had taken poison, he immediately reported it to the front desk. At that moment, Xie Nanxie and Shi Xingda happened to be at the Qitai Inn looking for him. They were extremely alarmed and immediately took Qian Zhexian to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. After examination by Dr. Zhu of the hospital, Qian woke up, but he was still unable to speak. However, his life was likely out of danger. In the evening, Shi Xingda took a boat back to report to Qian Zhexian's mother and brother, who came to Wuxi to take care of him.</p>

<p>Widow's Regretful Remarriage Leads to Lawsuit: Jin Chen, a widow from the 41st Tu of Langjia Bridge South, lost her husband early and was unwilling to live alone. She had an affair with her farmhand, Lu Acai, which recently deepened. Seeking a permanent arrangement, Lu offered a "tea gift" of 120 yuan as the cost of becoming her "adopted" husband and officially cohabitated with her on the 20th of last month. Unexpectedly, after the fact, the widow was coerced by her clan uncle, Jin Gou, due to a dispute over the management of her family property, and hastily filed a lawsuit with the county, claiming forced marriage. During the interrogation the day before yesterday, Lu first stated the details of their love affair and claimed that the cohabitation was not of his own volition, providing a signed document as proof. He now regretted it, saying that he was deceived by sweet words and felt ashamed and indignant. The widow gave vague and bizarre statements. After the judge presented evidence and questioned them, Lu revealed the past events, and the widow had no choice but to agree. It is reported that the case was not resolved through mediation, so a summons was issued again yesterday for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Bandits Openly Levying Contributions Door-to-Door: In the Luyang Lake area bordering Jiangdu and Gaoyou, bandit activity has been rampant. According to reports, robberies are frequent. Recently, hundreds of bandits have been entrenched in Chenjia Village, Zhenwu Temple, which belongs to the county. In addition to rifles and Mauser pistols, they are equipped with mortars and hand-held water-cooled machine guns. Yesterday, it was reported that the bandits openly summoned the local township heads, demanding that they raise 20,000 yuan within twelve hours or face the consequences. The bandits sent armed men to accompany the township heads to each household to demand money. If the residents were unable to pay, the bandits initially set fire to their haystacks as a warning, then doused quilts in kerosene and nailed them to the walls of the houses before setting them on fire. Zhenwu Temple is only three miles away from the village, and although there are 30 members of the land and water police stationed at the temple, they dare not come to the rescue due to their weak numbers. As a result, nine out of ten households on the east and west banks of Zhenwu Temple have fled. It is also reported that a large group of 700 to 800 bandits have gathered in the Sanduo Township area of Gaoyou. The extortion of contributions and arson are also occurring there. It is reported that Director Li of the Security Office plans to join forces with the Jiang and Gao counties to launch a large-scale encirclement and suppression operation in the coming days.</p>

<p>The Rising Tide of Rickshaw Rental Fees: There are more than ten rickshaw companies in Jiaxing, with a total of over 280 rickshaws in operation each day. Each rickshaw is subject to a daily rental fee of 4 jiao. Recently, some rickshaw pullers requested that the companies reduce the number of rickshaws in operation and were willing to increase the rental fee accordingly. Some companies were receptive to this idea, and as a result, the daily rental fee per rickshaw was increased by 4 fen to 4 jiao 4 fen from November 1st. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 2nd, the majority of the rickshaw pullers refused to work. A small number, driven by the need to earn a living, continued to pull rickshaws on the streets. The majority of the rickshaw pullers, believing that they were not united, ordered them to return their rickshaws and damaged the rickshaws so that they could not be used again. At the same time, they beat up four rickshaw pullers, including Xia. The incident was reported to the Public Security Bureau, which inquired with the rickshaw companies. The companies, realizing that the situation had become strained, denied that they had increased the rental fee. In the afternoon, they issued a notice stating that the rental fee would not be increased. When Dan Dun-san, a judicial officer from the Public Security Bureau, found the rickshaw foreman and informed the rickshaw pullers, urging them to start working immediately and declaring that the rental fee would not be collected that day, the rickshaw pullers were satisfied and immediately began to work. However, it is reported that Xia and others who were beaten and injured will file a lawsuit in court.</p>

<p>Buque Bridge Township Robbed by Bandits: Xiaque Bridge is a major town in Hangzhou County with a thriving market. At 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, five bandit ships suddenly arrived, carrying about 30 bandits armed with wooden-cased guns. After landing, they fired their guns to intimidate the entire town. The seventh police station, overwhelmed by the number of bandits, did not dare to resist, allowing the bandits to search every house for three hours before leaving. The total loss is estimated to be no less than 100,000 yuan. Before leaving, they also kidnapped the respected gentlemen Gao Ruitang, Gao Xulin, and his daughter. The market was left desolate.</p>
<p>Banditry Resurfaces in Taishun: Banditry in Taishun has repeatedly risen and fallen. Since the resignation of the 4th Regiment Commander Gan, yesterday (the 3rd), according to a telegram from citizens in the county, the Zhou bandit gang, after being attacked by the 1st Battalion, fled to the border area between Taishun, Bianyuan, and Shouning. Recently, He Jinbiao, who was offered amnesty, reassembled his remnant forces, uniting over 600 men. The bandits, numbering about 800, have returned and attacked Zhoubin Village and besieged Ruiyang Township. They have reportedly kidnapped over 20 hostages and occupied Shiyang and Yanshan, and are also burning and looting in four directions. Another contingent is stationed in Nanyang, Shouxian, plotting to attack Taizhou City to control the garrison and extort the people. They are extracting civilian wealth by imposing forced loans of silver dollars, committing all kinds of evil. The villagers are fleeing, leaving the late rice crop abandoned. The occupied towns are in imminent danger. After receiving the report, the provincial government immediately telegraphed Zhu, the acting commander of the 4th Regiment, to quickly deploy heavy troops to suppress the bandits and prevent them from entering Ruian and Pingyang counties. At the same time, the provincial government ordered Liu Xiwen, the commander of the 1st Regiment, to transfer the 2nd Battalion from Qingtian to join the attack, ensuring that the bandits are completely eradicated to protect the residents and restore their livelihoods.</p>

<p>Disputes Over Estimated Rent Collection for Tenant Farms: The agricultural associations of Sihu, Konghu, and other villages in Xiaoshan County have estimated that the average yield of late rice this year is 3.2 shi per mu. Most landowners are dissatisfied because they believe that the harvest this year is abundant and exceeds this amount. The village and neighborhood associations have submitted a report to the county government, based on the farmers' estimated harvest, for record keeping. The county government has rejected the report, stating that the procedure for making a unilateral estimate is not in accordance with regulations. This has led to frequent disputes between farmers and landlords. Recently, both parties have sought guidance from the provincial government, but it is not known how it will be handled.</p>

<p>Students Have Not Yet Returned to Class</p>
<p>Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Investigate Thoroughly</p>
<p>Faculty and Staff Issue Statement</p>
<p>The students of the Second Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural College at Shangjin Bridge outside Tumen protested over food issues around 7:00 a.m. on October 31st, leading to a class strike by the entire student body against Dean of Studies Dai Qixiang. On the previous day (the 1st), the students of the First Agricultural College organized a support association. The students of the Second Agricultural College also went on strike and distributed official statements. If the goal of expelling Dai Qixiang is not achieved, they will not return to class. The strike has therefore expanded. Principal Liao Jianan went to the provincial capital on the morning of the 2nd to meet with the Director of the Education Department to request instructions. Principal Liao returned to Suzhou by car yesterday (the 3rd). After arriving in the provincial capital, Principal Liao went to the provincial government, the provincial party headquarters, and the Education Department to present the entire situation, stating that the student unrest was actually a minor matter that had been amplified by organization. Because Principal Liao reported this way, the provincial government decided to send personnel to Suzhou to conduct a thorough investigation. Yesterday (the 3rd), a special telegram was sent to Huang, the county magistrate of Wuxian County, ordering him to go to investigate the matter and report back for review. (Statement from Faculty and Staff)</p>
<p>The preparatory students of the Second Branch of our school suddenly used throwing bowls at the dining hall during breakfast on October 31st as a signal. They swarmed to the office of Preparatory Dean Dai Qiyang, dragged Dai out, and beat him all the way out of the school with fists and kicks (his arms, knees, face, and waist were bruised and swollen, and he had a high fever). They then closed the school gates and posted slogans, shouting many outrageous slogans. At that time, the principal and dean of studies heard the news and tried to stop them, but they refused to listen. After gathering them for a discussion and earnestly explaining the situation and asking them about the cause of the incident, the students were unable to answer and instead shouted loudly and behaved unreasonably, as if they were drinking mad medicine. The commotion continued until late at night. The next day at dawn, they swarmed to the first branch of the university in an attempt to coerce students into joining them. The undergraduate students were not moved and continued to attend classes as usual. The preparatory students then broke into the classrooms, forcibly dragging the teachers out and demonstrating to the undergraduate students. If anyone tried to reason with them, they would try to beat them. The barbarity of these students is truly heartbreaking. The Second Branch of our school is located near Tumen, and the preparatory students have very little self-control. Dean Dai has always been strict in his management in order to protect the young people, which is also his responsibility, but he did not realize that this would lead to resentment. The cause of the incident lies in this. Their unreasonable behavior is truly lamentable. The students beat Dean Dai for his conscientious management, and they tried to beat the faculty and staff for their advice and guidance. They tried to beat the faculty and students of the First Branch for attending classes. Such acts of violence put everyone in danger. We, the faculty and staff, unanimously urge the principal to investigate the leaders of this riot, punish them severely according to the school regulations, and take effective measures to protect the safety of the faculty and staff. We will temporarily do our best to maintain the school and support the principal. We hereby declare this in the hope that it will be publicly recognized.</p>

<p>Sets a Deadline for All Schools to Submit Reports</p>
<p>Will Prohibit the Teaching of Party Doctrines</p>
<p>The Party Headquarters Has Strongly Opposed It</p>
<p>Riri News states that there are a total of 93 municipal and private primary schools in the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Settlement, according to a survey conducted in May of this year. As of now, the number is even higher. There are also more than ten private primary schools run by foreigners. Previously, the Municipal Education Bureau planned to bring the primary schools run by foreigners under control in order to unify education in the city. After hearing this news, the Municipal Council immediately investigated the Chinese primary schools in the settlement and issued a form to each school, setting a deadline of the end of December for the detailed submission of information about the school, such as the principal, professors, students, funding, and tuition fees. At the same time, the Municipal Council established an Education Department to manage all matters related to schools in the settlement and has planned to ban the teaching of the Three Principles of the People in schools after they are all managed by the Municipal Council's Education Department. It will also increase the number of religious courses. Recently, after receiving this order and the form to be filled out, some weak schools have filled out the form according to the requirements, while others have opposed the foreigners' invasion of our country's educational authority and ignored it. They have also reported the situation to the party headquarters in each district for verification. The party headquarters in the third and fourth districts held meetings to discuss the matter and have decided on the following countermeasures: (1) Order all schools to refuse to fill out the report form; (2) Submit a request to the government to seriously negotiate with the Municipal Council. After receiving this notice, all schools have unanimously complied with the first point, it is said.</p>

<p>The Labor University dispute has not been completely resolved. Outsiders are eager to know the truth. According to a person from the school affairs council, the school has suffered repeated punishments from the education authorities in recent years. Since the dismissal of Principal Yi, the Ministry of Education has repeatedly inspected and reviewed the school in less than two months and has changed its orders regarding the appointment of the principal. Since Chairman Jiang decided on three solutions, they were extremely happy and planned to implement them. On the one hand, they rushed to create inspection forms, and on the other hand, the school affairs council maintained school affairs to wait for the new principal to be appointed. However, after more than ten days, the inspectors have not yet come to the school, and a small number of students instigated by a certain party blamed the new principal for not being appointed. The colleagues at the Labor University can only maintain the status quo with the founders and request the Ministry of Education to quickly implement the solutions proposed by Chairman Jiang. If there are other motives to delay the matter and break the Labor University, who will be responsible? Society will have its own opinion, it is said.</p>

<p>The faculty and staff of Fudan Experimental Middle School held a provisional meeting on the 2nd of this month. The meeting place was in the Tianmin Rong Hall in Yokohama Bridge, North Sichuan Road. The attendees were Tao Xisheng, Huang Naijiao, Xiong Changwan, Xu Xu, Qi Yun, Gui Yu, Chen Kecheng, Jin Zuci, Chen Changde, Yan Rongwei, Zheng Baohua, Gong Miannan, Mu Tonghai, Li Chongpu, Jiang Junchen, Sang Menghen, Wu Qingren, Wu Zulong, Xi Diqing, Xu Yinxi, Jiang Naili, Fang Yiju, Yu Chun, Xie Liuyi, (Yu Chun acting), Ma Sanmei, Wang Peisun, Liu Zhixin. The observers were Ge Jinhui, Yang Tianjue, and Jiang Yimen. The representatives of the student school affairs promotion association of the Experimental Middle School were Deng Ji, Hou Jinghuan, (Lin Zhaoguang), and Jiang Ding. Chairman Tao Xisheng, recorder Wang Peisun. The chairman reported on the outcome of the incident during the summer vacation. Mr. Wang Daofu was reinstated and invited to serve as secretary. He agreed to be responsible for one week, so Mr. Zhou Shixun was acting secretary one week later. Unexpectedly, Mr. Zhou Shixun resigned as acting secretary after one month and made a statement to the director. The director again requested leave and wanted Wang to serve as acting director. For the sake of the students' studies, he reluctantly took responsibility and asked Mr. Wang Peisun to serve as secretary. The school was peaceful and uneventful. The director was angry because the students and a small number of students from the Experimental Middle School opposed him, so he resigned. Lu Tonghai, the director of the school's fundraising committee, requested that all faculty and staff be convened within three days after Mr. Chen's resignation, so he convened this meeting today. However, there is a pressing issue that must be resolved in advance. He plans to no longer be involved in the affairs of the Experimental Middle School after today. Before the new director is appointed, he should ask the conference to discuss how to maintain the Experimental Middle School. He believes that the conference should immediately elect a few people to form a standing committee to maintain school affairs. The matters for discussion are: (1) Whether all faculty and staff temporarily hired by Deputy Director Tao during Principal Li's resignation and Director Chen's leave and resignation should have voting rights. It was resolved that, based on facts and reason and previous examples, they should all have voting rights. (2) Mr. Mu Tongyi proposed to retain Director Chen. It was resolved that Director Chen's resignation was very firm and could not be retained, and a new director should be elected immediately by the conference. (3) How to carry out the election? It was resolved to use a signed ballot method, with each ballot electing three people. Xiong Chang was designated to make the ballots, Huang Naiwen to collect the ballots, Xi Diqing and Jin Zuci to write the ballots, Yu Chun to announce the ballots, and student representatives Deng Ji and Lin Zhaoguang to supervise the ballots. The results of the election were as follows: Tao Xisheng 20 votes, Zhou Weiqun 18 votes, Liu Zhixin 17 votes. At this point in the meeting, Mr. Tao left the meeting and was succeeded by Mr. Liu Zhixin as chairman. (4) How to maintain the school before the director is officially approved by the principal? It was resolved to (1) organize a standing committee, (2) elect three people as standing committee members, and (3) publicly elect Liu Zhixin, Gui Yu, and Xu to be responsible, with Mr. Liu as chairman. (5) A declaration should be issued in the name of the conference to defend Mr. Chen Wangdao and state his past achievements. It was resolved to hand it over to the standing committee for handling.</p>

<p>Attended by over 400 people from more than 30 schools</p>
<p>The Shanghai Southern District Municipal School Teachers' Association held an academic lecture and its general assembly yesterday, the 3rd, at 1:30 PM at the Wuben Girls' School. Over 400 people from more than 30 schools attended. Zhao Luqing, Qian Xuanqing, and Chen Pingyi were publicly elected as chairpersons, and Xu Peihang and Xu Tongqian were selected as recorders. After the salutation, the chairperson reported that today's event was both the Shanghai Southern District Teachers' Association general assembly and an academic lecture. He said, "We, as municipal school teachers in the southern district of Shanghai, bear a heavy responsibility and should constantly study and seek advancement. Today's assembly and lecture can be said to address both aspects."</p>
<p>Academic Lecture: The lecturers, Mr. Cen Dezhang, Mr. Dong Renjian, and Mr. Fang Xun'guang, have been invited. First, please welcome lecturer Mr. Cen. Mr. Cen said, "I dare not call this a problem-solving lecture. Since we are all colleagues, I might as well speak frankly about the hardships. I often have thoughts about the scope of education. Is the teacher's responsibility only to teach students, and does it end there? Regarding those who consider themselves outside the scope of education, the problem with people is their fondness for being teachers. I believe the problem isn't liking to be a teacher, but being unwilling to be a student after becoming a teacher. Educators are busy all day, exhausting their energy, and can only barely fulfill the duties of a teacher. However, the world's knowledge is advancing rapidly. If we remain the same as when we were students, or if we teach for ten years and remain unchanged, what will the result be? It's easy to imagine. Teachers who want to improve themselves face obstacles in their environment, such as their livelihood, the school, and society. Their living conditions are difficult, and their salaries are meager, forcing them to seek self-sufficiency. Schools often focus their resources on students and neglect the teachers' professional development. Even if teachers want to advance themselves, they lack the resources. Society's perception of teachers is weak, and even if they strive for advancement, they are not valued. A perfunctory attitude arises as a result, causing this precious quality to be lost. A teacher should both teach students and pursue knowledge, so that their own knowledge constantly advances and those being taught also improve daily. This would be a blessing for society." Next, Mr. Dong Renjian lectured on the "Life Path of Education" (A) Education (Education is a specialized field), not a temporary job. In primitive times, there was no division of labor. Later, education became established and advanced into a specialized field. However, the level of specialization among teachers is not as high as in fields like medicine and law, with primary school teachers being the most highly valued in terms of professional competence. (B) Specialized Education: Modern education is based on scientific principles, utilizing stable sciences such as psychology, education, sociology, and economics to aid in education. By 1920, primary education had become truly professionalized. After 1920, secondary education gradually became professionalized, and in the future, universities will likely follow suit. (C) (The Life Path of Education) What is the current state of education in China? We can understand this from the number of children attending school, students' academic performance, and the living conditions of teachers. Educators should be educated, but not separated from other areas like politics and economics. However, the focus must always be on education. Therefore, schools can be specialized, but they cannot completely forget their educational purpose. Education is about humanization, which cannot be ignored. In summary, to seek the professionalization of education and a life path: (1) Teachers should act professionally and not forget that education is a profession. (2) Schools are professional institutions. While they may discuss politics and economics, they should fundamentally focus on education. (3) Education is a developing profession, not a tool for personal gain. In the current professional situation, universities are the last to change. Finally, Mr. Fang Xun'guang lectured on (New Standards for Phonetic Symbols and National Pronunciation). After the lecture, the general assembly was held.</p>
<p>General Assembly: The general assembly was still chaired by Qian Xuanqing, Zhao Luqing, and Chen Pingyi. Representatives Zhu Ya'kui from the Municipal Party Department and Li Dachao from the Municipal Education Bureau were invited to provide guidance, limiting the discussion to (1) an amendment to the association's constitution, which was approved; (2) the election of supervisory committee members. Qian Xuanqing, Li Bojun, Xi Anzhai, Xu Peihang, Xu Zhenxia, Zhao Luqing, Xu Tongqian, Wang Weiru, Hu Huaitian, Huang Tieya, Xu Pinren, Xu Zhilin, Qian Cijiu, Xu Liaohua, and Gu Yinqian were elected as executive committee members. Bao Yuxueyao, Hou Zhoujinji, Wang Dingcheng, and Yao Jiji were nominated as alternate executive committee members. Wu Bokang, Ju Xinghong, Wang Beiwu, Yu Jiu, Shi Baihu, Huang Zhuang, Zou Yinlu, Lu Hanqiu, and Cao Junruo were elected as supervisory committee members. Luo Lin, Zhang Qidong, and Huang Shengbai were nominated as alternate supervisory committee members. (3) A request to the Education Bureau to organize an out-of-town tour for teachers and staff was approved and handed over to the executive committee to handle. (4) A request to the Education Bureau to establish a phonetic symbol training institute: Education Bureau representative Li Dachao reported that the bureau had already begun preparations for this. The issue was not discussed. (5) How to handle the remaining funds from the previous Joint Association: Reserved. (6) A request to the Education Bureau to issue a registration certificate for the association was approved and handed over to the executive committee to handle. The meeting adjourned at 5 PM.</p>

<p>The local Bank Club holds a handicap billiards competition for its members every year. The first and second place winners each receive a silver cup, and the name of the first place winner is engraved on the club's large silver cup for commemorative purposes. A total of 32 people participated in this year's competition, and Li Gongying and Xu Junyi have qualified for the finals. Li is the one who participated in the competition organized by foreigners at the Shanghai Municipal Government this year and won the championship. Therefore, it is not easy for him to win the finals even though he has to hit 550 points according to this year's handicap standards. It is reported that the finals will be held at 6:30 PM today in the club's billiard room to determine who will win the championship. It is expected that there will be a fierce competition at that time.</p>

<p>| Review in the Morning Today | Third General Assembly in the Afternoon |</p>
<p>Policies for Developing China's Industry and Commerce - Zhu Tongjiu</p>
<p>Agriculture, industry, and commerce are the foundation of a country's economic organization. The three are equally important and should not be harmed. If a country is rich in natural resources, it should utilize its natural resources to develop agriculture, industry, and commerce simultaneously, as in the United States. If a country is unfortunately limited by its land area, it should develop its unique strengths to compensate for the deficiencies, as in England. This is the principle of applied economics, and no one would dare to deny it.</p>
<p>China has a vast territory and abundant natural resources. In principle, agriculture, industry, and commerce should be developed simultaneously. However, the reality is far from this. Regarding agriculture, grain shortages frequently reach our ears. This year, the import of foreign rice amounted to millions of stones. China, known to the world for its agricultural base, relies on foreign countries for its grain supply. It is both pitiful and ridiculous to say. For now, let us leave agriculture aside and talk about industry and commerce. The stagnation of industry and commerce remains the same. Foreign goods flood the market, while domestic goods are as rare as morning stars. China's market is almost entirely occupied by foreign goods. The economic losses for China each year amount to no less than tens of millions. Regarding commerce, the power of finance is firmly controlled by foreigners. Even in the major trading ports, most of the import and export trade is controlled by foreign merchants. Chinese merchants are only responsible for errands and eat the leftovers. How can we speak of flourishing commerce?</p>
<p>Now that the National Industry and Commerce Conference has convened, I will present some strategies for developing China's industry and commerce, based on what I have seen and heard, for the reference of China's industrial and commercial giants. Please find them detailed below:</p>
<p>1. Protective Tariff Policy: China's tariffs have been unable to be independent for years due to the constraints of unequal treaties. The destruction of China's nascent industries by foreigners is due to this. Although we can now implement tariff autonomy, the tax rates are still determined by agreement and cannot be said to be completely free. Therefore, protecting domestic nascent industries is still not allowed in practice. If we want to develop industry today, it is necessary to implement complete tariff autonomy. This is the first point. In addition to the method of protection, the Chinese government must also encourage the export of domestic goods. The method of encouragement is what Mr. Yu Qiaqing proposed: (Exempting domestic goods from export tax and abolishing the tax exemption and tax payment methods for foreign goods.) This will reduce the cost of domestic goods and make it easier to sell them in foreign markets. Secondly, it will increase the price of foreign goods and reduce their sales in the country. The method is good and beautiful, achieving two benefits with one move. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Increased costs of industrial products lead to higher prices, which affects sales. From the consumer's point of view, foreign goods are well-made and their prices are not much different from domestic goods. Therefore, people tend to buy foreign goods. As a result, domestic goods are not easy to sell due to their high prices. Therefore, the heavy miscellaneous taxes in the interior directly increase the cost of industrial products and indirectly increase prices, resulting in losses due to poor sales. The ruthless miscellaneous taxes in the interior should be reduced as appropriate.</p>
<p>3. Promoting Transportation and Road Construction: It is well known that transportation in China is not very convenient, and transportation infrastructure cannot be called developed. Therefore, inland goods (raw materials) are not easily transported out to supply various factories. As a result, there are complaints about goods being abandoned in the inland, and factories lament the lack of raw materials. Under this kind of indifferent state, how can industry and commerce develop? This is the first point. Since inland raw materials are not easily transported out, the purchasing power of the inland people is low and they naturally cannot afford to buy industrial products from outside. As a result, the sales of domestic goods are affected. This is the second point. Since the transportation industry is not developed, transportation must be very inconvenient and the cost of transportation must be very high. Even if some industries are transported to the inland, their prices will be high. How can the farmers in the inland, who have low living costs, afford to buy them? This is the third point. With these three factors, the industrial products of the industrial and commercial centers cannot be transported into the inland for sale, and the original sales in the inland cannot be transported out to supply factories. This is a real obstacle to the future of industry and commerce. The only way to eliminate this obstacle is to promote transportation and road construction. 4. Improving Labor Treatment and Preventing Labor Strikes: In recent years, labor strikes have surged, and strikes are often heard. The reason is that labor treatment is too low, leading to livelihood problems. I believe that rather than reducing production due to labor strikes, it is better to increase wages to increase production efficiency, so that the industrial sector can do its best to produce, and the commercial sector can also buy and sell. The prosperity of industry and commerce depends on this. 5. Supporting Existing Domestic Industries to Prevent Foreign Merchants' Encroachment and Mergers: Existing domestic industries are often encroached upon or merged by foreign merchants with strong capital due to their small scale and limited capital. For example, in the match industry, Swedish merchants use their strong capital and trust methods to merge with them. The future of China's match industry is in imminent danger. I think that existing industries urgently need to be protected and maintained. The emergency method is that Mr. Liu Hongsheng, a member of the China Industrial and Commercial Management Association, proposed a method of merging and operating similar industries, which can remedy the situation. The China Industrial and Commercial Management Association may announce it soon, so I will not repeat it.</p>
<p>6. Eradicating Banditry: In recent years, there have been many bandits in the interior of China, making travel inconvenient and merchants hesitant. This is a major obstacle to the future of domestic commerce in China. I think that for the sake of developing domestic commerce, the central government should carry out a clearing campaign after the military is over to eradicate bandits and communists in order to remove obstacles. Whether or not this will be implemented is the responsibility of the government, but the responsibility of requesting it lies with the Industry and Commerce Conference.</p>
<p>7. Protection for the Industrial and Commercial Sectors: Since the establishment of the Republic of China, there has not been a year without war in the country, and before and after the war, the source of war funds has mostly come from the industrial and commercial sectors. Before the war broke out, the industrial and commercial sectors shouldered a portion of the military expenses. Winning the war is good, but losing the war would result in local extortion and a complete wipeout. After the new army arrived, it would be necessary to prepare funds to welcome them. Again and again, how can the capital of the industrial and commercial sectors not be exhausted? In addition, after the war ended, the local area suffered and the market was depressed. How can industry and commerce not decline? This is the first point. In recent years, the biggest problem in the country is the large number of soldiers. With many soldiers, it is difficult to raise funds. Therefore, many armies raise funds in their stationed areas. Industrial and commercial enterprises with a larger scale are often patronized by Mr. Qiuba. Therefore, almost all factories and merchants, large and small, are in a state of anxiety. This is the second point. Taking into account the above two situations, both are fatal injuries to the future development of industry and commerce. I think the central government should plan for the aftermath to protect the industrial and commercial sectors. In summary, the above (1), (2), (6), and (7) are the responsibility of the government, and (3), (4), and (5) are the responsibility of the industrial and commercial sectors themselves. I sincerely hope that the Industry and Commerce Conference will find a way to improve the future, so that the future of industry and commerce in our country may have a chance.</p>

<p>After the chairman, Kong Xiangxi, performed the salutation ritual, he reported that the meeting was officially opened, and the Secretariat would first report.</p>
<p>Report from the Secretariat: Secretary-General Zhang Yichou reported four points: (1) Representatives from provincial governments continued to register, including Hebei, Shanxi, and Heilongjiang. All 28 provinces and 5 municipalities had representatives in attendance. (2) The deadline for submitting proposals to the conference was originally October 15th, but proposals are still being submitted one after another. If there are any further proposals, they must be submitted before 12:00 PM on November 4th to be included in the discussion at the 5th general assembly. Proposals submitted after the afternoon of the 4th will not be accepted. If there are any particularly important ones, they can be made as temporary proposals. (3) Premier Tan's state funeral is still being held. The association is scheduled to gather at the Central Hotel at 8:00 AM on Wednesday (the 6th) to attend the public memorial service together. (4) The cotton textile exhibition at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's National Goods Exhibition Hall will open today. Please feel free to visit during the break.</p>
<p>After Zhang's report, the chairman reiterated the above four points, and the Nanjing Guanghua Photography Studio took a photograph on the spot.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Report from the First Group <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The chairman reported that each group could report on those that had been reviewed first. Zhang Xinwu, chairman of the First Group Review Committee, took the stage to report on the review situation. The group had 62 proposals, and the Sixth Group transferred one, for a total of 63 proposals. After review, five cases, including the first, eighteenth, twenty-second, twenty-seventh, and thirty-fifth, were of great importance and should be discussed by the general assembly. The remaining cases were submitted to the Ministry for review and handling, or were selected.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Full Text of the Review Report Attached <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The conference submitted 62 proposals, and the sixth group transferred one proposal.

<p>Discussion of the Situation of Each Case</p>
<h3 id="e113">(Passed) Case 1: Submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for Discussion <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Proposal on Joint Domestic Industry and Commerce Operations (Review Opinion) This case is needed by the times, but it concerns the industrial and commercial circles themselves. It is proposed that the General Assembly discuss it.</p>
<p>The Counselor of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce reported on the content of this case and asked the members to discuss it. (Discussion) Liu Hongsheng reported on the situation of the Swedish merchants' Ruizhong Match Company suppressing Chinese merchants. I once united three match companies to handle the match business, and its performance was better than the three companies handling it separately. It can also concentrate capital and talents to compete with foreign merchants. Therefore, I absolutely agree with this case. Hu Shuhua seconded the motion and asked the chairman to put it to a vote. Wang Jie'an advocated that the Ministry issue an order to the various chambers of commerce for implementation. Wang Yunwu said that the effectiveness of the method requires detailed research and investigation. Germany once established this institution with 6,000 experts. Therefore, this case should be researched by an agency jointly organized by the industrial and commercial circles and the government to make the implementation of this plan more effective. The chairman advocated that after this case is passed, Wang Yunwu should submit another proposal for discussion. (Passed)</p>
<h3 id="e114">Case 18 (Luo Chen's Outline of Industrial and Commercial Policies <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>| Resolved to Merge with Other Cases | Zhang Wu reported on the review situation (Review Report on Case 18) The general outline of industrial and commercial policies mentioned in this case is very important. It is proposed that the General Assembly discuss it. Liu Kuikui and Pan Xulun advocated that this case is very broad and can be merged with other more concrete methods to be more effective. Lu Chengzhang seconded the motion and resolved (this case is merged into other cases) (majority passed). The chairman, seeing that the photographic materials were all foreign goods, invited all the gentlemen attending the meeting to launch a grand company to organize a Chinese photographic materials company to recover our rights and interests. The members agreed.</p>
<h3 id="e115">(Passed) Case 22 (Proposal on Prohibiting the Export of Factory Sand and Waste Iron) <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The original proposer, Hu Shuhua, reported on the content of this case. All principles in the first article, which stated that the government should issue a clear order prohibiting the export of iron, have been reviewed and passed. The second article stated that the competent authorities should set the price method when domestic steel and iron factories purchase iron sand and waste iron. The original proposer withdrew. Shi Ying said that the situation of Hubei mining sand being sold to the Japanese-run Yangtze Machinery Company is very important. I once advocated prohibiting exports. Ding Jingchen said that the prohibition of the export of waste iron and iron sand must be specified in detail. China's current steel and iron needs are all supplied by foreigners. I advocate using tariffs to increase the prohibition of iron exports. Lu Chengzhang said that China's iron ore, first of all, Muye Ping Dazhi and Taiping Mine in Anhui, are all related to Japan. If this case is passed, then those not related to the Japanese will be prohibited from exporting, thus suspending operations. I advocate formulating another method. Wang Ruoxi reported on the situation of the iron ore in Dongshan Province being controlled by the Japanese. Wu Jian said that the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining had long planned to limit the method for this case, but the Ministry of Finance opposed the iron sand export tax increase method. I advocate that the government set up a special agency to set the price. Fang said that I oppose abolishing the iron sand export policy and should stipulate that if there is a surplus of iron needed in the country, it can be exported. Pan Xulun advocated that this case (should be reviewed and handled by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining) (majority passed).</p>
<h3 id="e116">Case No. 27 (Eliminate Foreign Enterprises in China to Resist Economic Aggression) <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>| Resubmit for Detailed Review and Formulation of Measures | Wang Jie’an and Ma Ze Zhao Advocate Restricting Foreigners’ Development of Industries in China. Case No. 27: Eliminate Foreign Enterprises in China to Resist Economic Aggression. First, the original proposer, Zhu Bin Yuan, reported on the intention of the case, but the measures were slightly inadequate. He requested the assembly to discuss. Wang Ruoxi stated that foreign factories could create skilled workers and other benefits for China, but under considerable conditions, foreigners should be encouraged to establish factories in China. When China has sufficient strength, then elimination can be considered. Li Quanshi stated that during the review, the phrase "eliminate" in this case was changed to "restrict," and restrictions were imposed through registration and licensing measures. (Detailed review opinions can be found in yesterday's newspaper). Ma Ze Zhao stated that the Japanese are vigorously developing the textile industry in China, which affects the development of China's cotton yarn industry. Therefore, he advocated that foreign enterprises should be restricted. Xu Ji  stated that the root of the problem can only be resolved after the abolition of unequal treaties. This case can be resubmitted to the review committee for detailed formulation of measures before being resubmitted to the assembly for discussion. The Chairman reported that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce should register and restrict foreign businesses in China at the Chinese government office. Future regulations in the industrial and commercial laws should be detailed to ensure that foreigners adhere to the scope of business. Yang Xingfo stated that the assembly has very little time. To save time, if there are no questions, the original proposer does not need to report. A separate case can be established to thoroughly study and discuss the matter of foreign industries in China. Wang Jie'an stated that foreigners have strong financial resources, which hinders the development of Chinese industries. Therefore, he advocated that restrictions should be imposed appropriately. It was resolved that the case should be submitted to the review committee for detailed formulation of measures. If members have opinions, they can submit them in writing to the review committee or participate in the review committee.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Case No. 35 (Proposed Establishment of Protection Policies to Maintain the Basic Industries of the Northeast) <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>| Difficult and Requires Extended Deliberation |</p>
<p>| Returned to Original Group for Re-examination |</p>
<p>Case No. 35: Proposed Establishment of Protection Policies to Maintain the Basic Industries of the Northeast. Wu Xiang Chen explained that the commercial status of the Northeast is important and should be actively protected. Then, Wei Tingsheng and Chao Jun repeatedly studied the matter. Some suggested that the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance should determine appropriate measures for the exit tax. Others suggested that commercial protection policies should be based on the nation as a whole, not just local areas. As a result, it was determined that this case was of great importance and required extended deliberation. It was generally agreed that the case should be returned to the original review committee members for re-examination, which was supported by all.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Resolution That Each Group's Review Report Must Have an Overall Principle <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>| Each Group Organized Last Night |</p>
<p>The cases submitted to the Forestry Association by the first group have now been concluded. Then, someone requested that Cases No. 36 and No. 40, which the review committee had resolved to send to the ministry for reference and did not need to be presented, should still be presented to the assembly for discussion. Someone also proposed the following motions: 1. Proposals without specific measures should not be discussed. 2. Review reports should be respected and not changed arbitrarily. 3. Review should formulate standards. Vice Chairman Zheng Hongnian reported that based on today's review report, there were many proposals related to the agenda, and some were too broad. The review had few concrete results. Each group chairman and committee member should consult together tonight and formulate several basic principles within their respective groups. All cases with similar characteristics should be grouped under these principles and specific measures should be determined to facilitate resolution and implementation. If there are any outstanding matters, they can only be supplemented during the assembly, which was supported by all.</p>
<p>Chairman Group Nominated by Each Group</p>
<p>| Adjourned at 5 PM |</p>
<p>Subsequently, the issue of the Chairman Group was discussed. It was decided that each group would nominate one person to report at tomorrow's assembly. As for the drafting committee for the assembly declaration, it was decided that the Chairman would select some people to be responsible for drafting. At this point, the bell rang five times, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Today's Third Assembly <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>

<p>Telegram Request from the Overseas Chinese Federation</p>
<h3 id="e120">Amendment to the Chamber of Commerce Law <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Detailed Rules, Article 41</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation sent a telegram to the assembly, stating: "To the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen and all members of the National Industrial and Commercial Conference in Nanjing: We have repeatedly received telegrams and letters from the Overseas Chinese General Chambers of Commerce requesting that you appeal for the amendment of Article 41 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Chamber of Commerce Law (Overseas Chinese General Chambers of Commerce will be renamed Overseas Chinese Chambers of Commerce under this law) during your conference, so that the Overseas Chinese General Chambers of Commerce can continue to use their old names. The reason is that the Overseas Chinese General Chambers of Commerce use the Malay transliteration (TiongHwaTjongSiangHwee) as their name, which has been approved for registration by the residing government. All contracts and properties are handled under the aforementioned (Malay transliteration name). Once the name is changed to Overseas Chinese Chambers of Commerce, it will not only seem different to us, but also appear completely different to the residing government. It will be necessary to revise the foreign articles of association and re-apply to the residing government for examination and registration. The residing government has long witnessed that various Overseas Chinese General Chambers of Commerce are wholeheartedly supporting the motherland and assisting the revolution, which is like a thorn in their side. They have repeatedly considered suppressing them, but because each General Chamber of Commerce has been approved for registration for decades, it is inconvenient to revoke them without cause. If the name is changed and re-registered, they will inevitably be subjected to various criticisms and may not be granted approval. New ones will be difficult to establish, and old ones may be forced to dissolve. Overseas Chinese merchants will have no possibility of unity, and the contracts and properties held under the (Malay transliteration name) will become invalid at the same time, resulting in considerable losses. We believe that the government cherishes overseas Chinese compatriots with utmost care. Previously, the association telegraphed to request aid for the Kunming fire, and the National Government immediately ordered officials to provide comfort and instructed the Ministry of Finance and the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong to telegraph 100,000 yuan, and the Relief Committee telegraphed 10,000 yuan. The overseas Chinese community is deeply grateful. If we allow overseas Chinese Chambers of Commerce to be dissolved due to this insignificant matter of name, it will not only contradict the original intention of the legislation but also be unbearable for all of you at this conference. Therefore, we earnestly implore you to consider that overseas Chinese compatriots have consistently loved the country and the party for a long time. They participated in the Northern Expedition and the Eastern Campaign. Please grant the motion to amend Article 41 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Chamber of Commerce Law (Overseas Chinese General Chambers of Commerce will be renamed Overseas Chinese Chambers of Commerce under this law) so that the Overseas Chinese General Chambers of Commerce can continue to use their old names.

<p>Chambers of Commerce of Various Counties in Jiangsu Request Prompt Discussion of</p>
<h3 id="e121">Commercial Accounting Dates <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>

If it is not resolved soon, it will have a significant impact on national finance and social economy.

<h3 id="e122">Opening of Cotton Industry Exhibition <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM on November 3rd, the opening ceremony of the Cotton Industry Exhibition at the National Products Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce was held. Over two hundred representatives from various government agencies and commercial organizations, as well as guests, attended. The Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce,  Zhou Yue, presided over the ceremony and delivered a speech, stating that he was honored by the presence of all sectors at the opening of today's Cotton Industry Exhibition. The purpose of the exhibition is to promote domestic goods. The Japanese residing in China still use goods dried in the sun, which shows that promoting domestic goods is the most important thing today. It is not that the Chinese do not love domestic goods, but because domestic goods are not refined and pursue luxury, so they prefer to use foreign goods. Now, domestic goods have been improved and progressed, and everyone should emulate the enthusiasm of the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and Japan in loving and using domestic goods to promote and use domestic goods. Only then can there be hope for the recovery of China's economy. One more thing, Indian silk is a product of domestic silk factories, but because Chinese people like to use foreign goods, this silk is named after foreign names. From now on, it is hoped that the society will use domestic silk and that domestic silk factories will not name Chinese silk goods with foreign terms. Next, Li Chongshi, representative of the Central Party Headquarters, and Xu Jianhong, representative of the National Government, delivered speeches. Next, Zhang Wohua, Vice Minister of the Ministry of the Interior, and others also gave speeches.</p>

<p>Glimpses of Proposals</p>
<h3 id="e127">Opinions and Six Proposals on Developing Overseas Chinese Industry and Commerce <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>(Proposal | Chen Anren, Representative of the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission)</p>
<p>The state of China's national economy and production has fallen into an extremely difficult situation urgently awaiting relief. This is something we cannot deny. From the perspective of the significance of the progress of the National Revolution, China will not have the opportunity to improve its national economy and production situation unless it completely eliminates the last remaining warlords in the North as soon as possible. From the perspective of the development of the national organism, China will not have a place for the progress of its national economy and production situation unless it restores social order in the shortest possible time, unifies the divided situation, and pacifies the phenomenon of war and turmoil that has lasted for more than a decade. Therefore, in today's terms, the major premise for improving and advancing the national economy and production situation is how to quickly complete the National Revolution, eliminate the warlords who hinder the economy and production, and how to quickly unify China's situation and eliminate all reactionaries. The simplest expectation is no less. However, China's current national economy and production situation is hindered and oppressed by foreign economic forces, making it even more difficult to rise. Therefore, in developing the national economy and production situation, on the negative side, it is necessary to eliminate the economic status of imperialism in China. According to foreign investment in China, the amount is about 2.5 billion yuan, of which Japan accounts for the largest investment, followed by the United Kingdom, and then the United States. According to a 1924 customs survey, there are 4,278 Japanese commercial firms in China, 726 British firms, and 470 American firms. Except for the United States, British and Japanese investment in China is mostly in commerce. British investment in China, including shipping, the cigarette industry, mining, banking, electricity, and other industries, amounts to approximately 43.7 million pounds, excluding loans for postal administration, railways, and other projects. Japanese investment in China in railways, transportation, warehouses, banks, textiles, agriculture, forestry, manufacturing, electricity, civil engineering, and other industries amounts to approximately 1.89 billion yuan. American investment in China amounts to approximately 147 million yuan, and the purchase of bonds in the Far East amounts to approximately 100 million yuan. Other expropriations of concessions, leased territories, banks, etc., are difficult to calculate. Furthermore, according to 192x statistics, British trade with China amounts to 319,594,403 pounds. Japanese trade with China, such as cotton textiles, cotton yarn, sugar, porcelain, paper, etc., according to 1929 statistics, amounts to 330,820,000 taels. American trade with China has been vigorously increasing in recent years. According to a 1917 survey, American trade with China accounted for 12 percent of China's foreign trade, and it has increased even more in recent years. Among the goods shipped to China, kerosene, tobacco, hardware, machinery, timber, and flour account for the most important positions. German trade with China has also made rapid progress in recent years. The damage to the national economy and national financial resources caused by the decline in foreign trade and the erosion of China by foreign goods is incalculable. Therefore, the development of China's industry and commerce cannot be achieved without eliminating the economic aggressive forces of foreign countries in China. Otherwise, trade with China has become a blood-sucking ghost that will die from exhaustion if not from consumption. Based on the current situation in China and the economic aggression of foreign countries against China, there is a way to save China from danger and recover the hardships of society and people's livelihood. What is this? From us, we further observe the current situation inside China. Due to the barrenness of land and the low yield, the increasing number of disaster areas, and the reduction of farmers, various reasons affect the panic of farmers' associations. The average annual import of agricultural products from the first year of the Republic of China to the ninth year is about 50 million yuan, and it has increased even more in recent years. Due to the decreasing agricultural production, other industrial and commercial industries have fallen into a state of decline. Now, our people feel that if we do not develop industry and commerce, we will not be able to survive in the world. The internal and external situation of China is already like this. Will we procrastinate, perfunctorily, and live in complacency to maintain the remaining situation, or will we rise up and strive for the final effort and struggle? We observe that after Germany's defeat in the war, not only was its politics destroyed, but its economy was even more severely damaged. After the war, reparations of 1.25 billion marks had to be paid out every year. Germany suffered this severe blow and vigorously reformed its domestic industry and commerce. As a result, the strong monopolization and rationalization of the industry came into being, and Germany's economic situation gradually changed, the productivity gradually increased, and the national livelihood gradually improved. After the revolution, Russia's economy fell into</p>

<p>— Zeng Jun</p>
<p>Too much closeness easily breeds rifts. Once affection breaks down and people hate each other, it's better than being strangers. Therefore, the friendship of gentlemen is as light as water.</p>
<p>An honest and sincere person, once misled into evil ways, will be beyond redemption.</p>
<p>Overemphasizing science makes life feel dry and dull; overemphasizing spirituality makes life even more lifeless.</p>
<p>Etiquette is a large curtain. Although one knows that it conceals some ugly things and is not really clean, to remove it would reveal the ugly deeds of society, which would be even more unbearable.</p>
<p>Without flattering, one cannot get food to eat; without boasting, one cannot gain people's trust.</p>
<p>Those who force people into despair and discouragement are as guilty as murderers.</p>
<p>It's not good if a woman is not beautiful because no one will love her; it's also not good if a woman is beautiful because everyone will fight for her.</p>
<p>An ugly person should be dignified to slightly hide their ugliness; a beautiful person can be more beautiful if they are dignified. As for those who wear makeup and make seductive gestures, they are all playthings of the world.</p>
<p>The endpoint of love is carnal desire. There is no pure spiritual love without special circumstances.</p>
<p>Hope with determination is ambition; hope that benefits oneself and harms others is ambition; hoping for something that one knows cannot be achieved is delusion. Ambition is necessary for ambition; there is no harm in having it, but delusion should not be had.</p>
<h3 id="e129">In Memory of Mr. Tian Tong, a Pioneer of the Kuomintang <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Jinguang</p>
<p>Mr. Tian, whose given name was Tong and courtesy name was Ziqin, was a pioneer of the Chinese Kuomintang from Jinchun, Hubei. He was chivalrous by nature and possessed the virtues of ancient gentlemen. His learning was profound, and both Chinese and foreign people who had the opportunity to hear his words and observe his demeanor admired and respected him. He had great ambitions from a young age. At a time when the Qing Dynasty was in danger and the political system was disintegrating, Mr. Tian was indignant at the defeat of the national cause and even more saddened by the suffering of the people. He believed that the world was in turmoil and did not know where it was going. If things continued like this, the country would cease to be a country. Therefore, he advocated reform and revolution and the establishment of a republic. As a result, he was hated by the Qing court, which secretly ordered his arrest, and there was no place for Mr. Tian to stand in the country. So he went to the East to seek further education and met the late Premier in Tokyo. They declared their goals of saving the country and confided in each other. They were overjoyed and inexplicably happy. They discussed revolutionary principles day and night and founded the Alliance to overthrow the Qing court and build a republic. Mr. Tian and the other members of the association traveled around to promote their ideas. Although they suffered repeated failures, they persevered and opened up the stubborn national customs of our country for thousands of years, leading them to the road of revolution. When the Wuchang Uprising broke out and the Republic of China was founded, Mr. Tian was appointed as the Hubei Pacification Commissioner and other positions. His political achievements were remarkable, and his contributions were immense. His moral integrity was especially beyond the reach of ordinary people. Because the two cases of imperial system and bribery in elections were successively multiplied, although there were many councilors at that time, they were hesitant and dared not speak out. Only Mr. Tian resolutely advocated the proposal of the National Assembly in the South. Later, he led the public to the South. Mr. Tian's power was great. Mr. Tian treated people with kindness and generosity, but when it came to the great righteousness, he also argued with his strict teachers and good friends, without any hesitation. When the late Premier proposed the Ronggong plan, Mr. Tian strongly opposed it. Knowing that it could not be reversed, he flicked his sleeves and left, saying to the late Premier, "The two of us are the only confidants. Since our political views are different, it is absolutely difficult to work together again. Private friendship will remain intact. From now on, I will regard you as a lifelong friend." Therefore, he resigned and retired to Songbin. At that time, I looked up to the Yuan Yue and personally received his teachings. The boundless clear waves benefited me infinitely. Mr. Ying told me, "Revolutionary youths should have a particularly calm and determined attitude and an uncompromising spirit. Even if they suffer repeated failures, they must not be pessimistic. This is a necessary situation in the evolution of the revolution. They must cultivate their spirit and learning and wait for the opportunity to rise again, so as not to fail as revolutionary youths." His words were reasonable and will last forever. In recent years, although Mr. has been living in seclusion in Songyun, his heart of worrying about the country has never been able to abandon himself. Therefore, he used his lifelong learning and experience to express his great views and founded the Taiping Magazine for people to refer to. The content is very rich, and the arguments are all bright and grand. Readers have praised and admired him endlessly. To speak for the world is what it means. Alas, I was hoping that Mr. Yuan Yuan would write and feed me new knowledge, and I was especially hoping that he would rise again in Dongshan and plan for development. Why did God not leave him behind and take my teacher away so quickly? Alas, Dao is too great to contain, and talent is difficult to use. I mourn for Mr.'s misfortune and grieve for the future of China.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Cat and Dog Barber Shops in New York <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Shuiqiu</p>
<p>Western women's fondness for raising cats and dogs has become a common practice. Wealthy families even spend huge sums to acquire exotic breeds to show off to relatives and friends. Therefore, the value of cats and dogs in Western society is indeed higher than elsewhere. Speculative merchants and those who raise dogs have opened cat and dog barber shops to specialize in bathing cats and dogs and profit from them. Recently, the opening of such barber shops along Broadway Road in New York has become numerous. There are two ways to bathe cats and dogs, and the prices are also different. One is dry cleaning, which only uses disinfectant mixed with bleaching powder, costing about half a dollar to one and a half dollars each time. The other is wet cleaning, which is the same as washing cats and dogs at home, costing about forty cents to seventy or eighty cents each time. European and American women are afraid of hard work and like leisure. Therefore, those who have cats and dogs all bring them to this kind of barber shop to wash them, and cat and dog barbers make a lot of money. There are also such businesses in Paris, London, and other cities, and dog doctors also operate this business a lot. I know that in the near future, such businesses will also be discovered in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e131">An Investigation Record of Shipu Port in Ermen Bay <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xinfu</p>
<p>Shipu Port is located in the northeast of Sanmen Bay, belonging to Xiangshan County, Zhejiang Province. It is an important fish market. It is 180 miles away from Dinghai, 240 miles away from Zhenhai, 170 miles away from Haimen, and 350 miles away from Wenzhou. The waterway has two gates, east and west. The west Sanmen (Xiaosanmen) is winding and shallow, and the east Tongwa Gate waterway is narrow and winding, with strong currents. Boats must wait for the tide to be level to enter and exit the lower bay. The two ports of Dongmen are narrow and have many reefs, and no one dares to try to travel. The southwest side of the city is deep, four or five to more than ten fathoms, where small ships can dock. The larger ships can also dock on the left and right of Manshan or west of Jinqi Gate, but when encountering the southeast wind, the waves are very large. The tide is high at nine and a quarter during the new and full moon. The high tide can be two fathoms, and the low tide is also more than one fathom. The larger sand reefs are the Laohu Reef at the east entrance of the Shumengang Port, which is hidden when the tide rises. The Linmengang Port has four reefs near the two mountain mouths. The Xiabawan Port also has several reefs at the east entrance. There are many reefs on the southeast side of Danantian Island. The larger islands are Dongmen, Dafu, Daguzhongjie, Yutang, Changkeng, Waidan Shuangshan, Beihezhonghe, Nanhe, Pingfeng, Lianchuitongtou, Huangzhitan, Tontouniluo, Nantian Nanshan, Yancanshan Danshuimen, and other islands. Among them, the Sanmen Mountain Island is located at the mouth of Sanmen Bay, and the terrain is particularly dangerous. The city and town are built on the mountain, and the city is densely populated. The southeast coastal area is named Yancangqian, which is a prosperous fish market. Ten miles to the northeast is Changguo Weiwei, half of which is barren. There are few houses in the north, but the streets are wide, and five horses can enter side by side. It was once an important town on the coast where the commander was stationed. The old school field outside the south gate is quite wide, separated from the Nanhui Mountain on the opposite bank. The east gate of the south side of the city has been dilapidated for a long time and has recently become a gathering place for fishermen. It is actually a fishing village. At the end of the east side of the island, Mentou has a lamp tower built by the Ren Xiaohe brothers. The inscription on the stele in front of the tower was written by Master Yu Changlin. The guest room also has many ink marks by Master Yu. Looking far away, the sea is wide and the sky is clear. It is a summer resort here, even better than Guling and Mogan. The main local products are fish and salt, followed by mountain potatoes, rice, and valleys. However, the mountains are barren and abandoned, which is a pity. If scientific new methods can be adopted to engage in agricultural and forestry industries, the future prospects are immeasurable. Moreover, this port is surrounded by mountains, and the terrain is majestic. The route is tortuous, which is the hub between Shanghai and Hong Kong in Zhejiang. Choosing a place on the north and south banks of the port can build a shipyard, which can be rectified and used as a resting place for naval cruisers. Is it just a fishing port?</p>

<p>— Fengjia</p>
<p>Water caltrop is a fine fruit of autumn, originally written as 蔆. The Shuowen says (蔆 is also called 芰 in Chu, 薢茩 in Qin, also called water chestnut, also called shaguo. The Wulin Record (the four-cornered is called 芰, the two-cornered is called water caltrop, its flowers bloom at night and close during the day, and move with the moon like the sunflower moves with the sun). Most of the products in Wuxia are four-cornered, but they are also commonly called water caltrop, and no one calls them 芰. However, Qu Dao, who loves 芰, was seen early in ancient books, so China has 芕 since ancient times. The different names of 芰 and water caltrop, but in fact of the same kind, can also be seen.</p>
<p>The method of planting water caltrops is to harvest old water caltrops after Chongyang Festival and soak them in the river for two or three months to germinate, then sprinkle them into the pond. The stems and ends emerge with leaves, slightly triangular, exposed to the water surface, with floating sacs on the petioles. When the leaves are abundant, there are duckweeds mixed in, which are removed. In summer, small white flowers bloom with four petals. The fruit has four corners, three corners, and two corners, so it is called water caltrop. It is either green or red, both raw and ripe are suitable. The ripe ones are soft and sweet, and the raw and tender ones are peeled and eaten, crisp like sad pears. Simmering with water caltrop white meat slices is especially delicious as a suocuan.</p>
<p>In my hometown's lakes and ponds, many small water caltrops are planted. The ones with sharp corners are commonly called touch-mouth water caltrops, and the ones with blunt corners are commonly called bald water caltrops. There are also reddish ones with a larger shape, commonly called water red water caltrops. Chen Yaozu's so-called pile of ripe water caltrops with rouge corners is sung about here. Every time the group orders young girls to ride wooden round barrels, stirring the water and flowing into the depths of the water caltrop bushes, their slender hands and green onions pick them one by one, then light songs and beautiful sentences are sent with the wind from a distance. Looking at the waves and figures from afar, it is like a wonderful water caltrop picking picture. Emperor Wu of Liang's poem says (Jiangnan girls' pearl wrists are amazing, cinnamon oars leisurely sing and pick water caltrops). Jiang Hong's water caltrop picking song says (the wind gives birth to green leaves and gathers waves, the purple stems bloom, containing flowers and fruits, waiting for a beautiful woman to come). This scene and this feeling are like paintings.</p>
<p>Between August and September, fresh water caltrops are sold on the market streets. Men, women, old and young, are not one of them, borrowing the opportunity to earn a small profit, which is also a speculative business for ordinary hawkers. Only in Pingwang Town in my town is it a different scene. The little family is beautiful and moving, carrying a basket and weighing scales, tripping through tea houses and taverns, often selling water caltrops in a charming voice and smiling and attracting people again and again. Customers with a drunkard's intention often welcome them. Life is quite bad, and the dragon is also a romance.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the seventh day, I arrived at Namyo and stayed at a Yunnan-owned inn. I asked about the rules. One meal costs half a yuan, and two meals cost one yuan. The room fee is not included. The meat and vegetables are very good, but I don't like them. However, the room is just a shed. There are many people, mountain slopes, forests, streams, waterfalls, and British houses and companies on the top of the mountain. The electric lights illuminate the night. When arriving at the station, the disease is first checked, and the ticket can be entered. Namyo is just a mountain village. There are restaurants in the stations. Its habits are the same as Penang. There are also such hotels in Penang, a large port, which do not count the money but only calculate the food. It is also strange. I once visited a friend whose residence was on Huoche Tou Street. I asked about the price. My friend said, "One night's room is one yuan, and each meal is two and a half jiao." But the room costs one yuan for ten days and one yuan for a month. I was very surprised and saw that the room could accommodate eight people, but in fact it could only accommodate two or three people. I am now traveling everywhere to avoid countless societies that cannot be judged by ordinary theories. Different places have different rights and wrongs.</p>
<p>There are Ban Yi people here, who are a kind of Burmese people with different languages, as well as mountain people and wild people. Men must carry knives when they go out, and women carry a hoe to trade goods. The women's clothes are beautiful, and the men are also handsome and not very black. The girls who are not married have short hair and are lively and strong, but unfortunately they are not educated. Yunnan people who go home pass through the settlements of mountain people. Single people are often imprisoned and sacrificed by them. It is a custom. In the Spring and Autumn Period of our country, Song Xiangtu</p>
<p>Basha still held Zeng Zi to sacrifice to ghosts. It is not easy to discuss the height of culture. How can this small nation be blamed? There are tailor shops run by Kalla people. Kalla people are a kind of Indian people. They hang a large water pipe in front of them, three feet high and four feet long. It is also the largest one I have seen in various places in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The Chinese nation has failed to become the greatest nation. Without the support of politics, its power has spread to five continents. Although it is weak now, it is still conceited and often calls others ghosts. Westerners call them hairy ghosts. Kalla people call them black ghosts. The Ban Yi people call them Ban Yi ghosts. The Burmese call them old Burmese. The old means stupid and dull. To this day, it is still like the heavenly Chinese stomach, which can also be comforting. A certain Liu from Yunnan talked about going to the dog country on the border between India and Myanmar. I cannot say its name. The name in the local language of the dog country is the name added by us Chinese. They do not call it dog, but call it dog country. Its location is in southwestern Myanmar. It takes a total of 23 days to travel. It takes four days by boat from Vancheng to Mengzhua, then four days by boat to Jilairin. Then go southwest for ten days to the mountains on the Indian border, which is the dog country. It is very poor and the food is only half-ripe taro corn. The people have no clothes, but the weather is not cold. The frost is an inch deep. It belongs to the British camp. Liu went to transport goods by horse for the British. The country likes Chinese people very much and hates British people. During the European War, the British levied a tax of two yuan per person, otherwise they had to join the army. They also asked for six animals. The locals hated them and often ambushed in the forest to shoot British people. There are also Chinese people who work as carpenters. Liu could not remember the original name of the country.</p>

<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Italian Tour Diary</p>
<p>(3) Rome, Ten Days (6)</p>
<p>— La ville eternelle, the Immortal City</p>
<p>June 1st, Spanish Masterpiece Exhibition and Sun-Drenched Modern Art Exhibition</p>
<p>Kawai Gyokudo, Komuro Suisho, Yamanouchi Tamon, etc. are students of the Southern School; Araki Mujin, Gen Shunkyo, and Domoto Insho are pure academy styles; Kojori Tomone and Kaburaki Kiyokata can be considered regular Japanese paintings, but they are just thickly applying powder and stealing the end skills of the Tang people. In terms of propaganda skills, their efforts and sincere attitude are worth admiring. From the perspective of the meaning of the content of the work, it is very superficial and annoying. The superficial beauty and frivolous attitude are like butterflies floating on spring wildflowers. It is said that their government allocated a huge sum of money for this meeting in Italy. The rich man Okura Kihachiro also donated 100,000 US dollars and invited the writer Yokoyama Taikan to come to Rome with a dozen of his disciples to respond. It can be seen that this is a major event that the Japanese pay close attention to. They are promoting culture to the outside world and raising their international status, posing as one of the so-called five major powers in the world. Every year they hold meetings in Paris and London, and it is always so exaggerated. Speaking of this, I can't help but imitate the tone of Shirakaba Itoku and say口:</p>
<p>The Japanese always want to show off their art everywhere. However, hasn't there always been no real painting in Japan? Isn't there also no real sculpture? What seems to be painting and what seems to be sculpture are just foreign ideas obtained from the Chinese. In fact, they are borrowings and revisions. To issue thorough efforts and culture, the corresponding vitality and foundation are not enough, so they can only fly out like butterflies, small and agile, and dazzling.</p>
<p>Ah, forgive them a little bit. There is no soil in their flowerpots. However, Europeans are generally deceived. You hear us traveling all over Europe, whether talking about art or literature, we always recommend the Japanese as the representatives of the East. In their minds, there is naturally no shadow of China at all, unless a very small number of specialized scholars know that the source of Eastern culture is in China. Don't say that. How about our Chinese ourselves? Even these small abilities and small agility don't have the basic ability to improve and have no interest. They only know how to sell the glory of their ancestors' legacy and have no reflection at all. They are completely depraved.</p>

<p>Hovering around 80 taels, the past three days coincided with the Western merchant autumn competition period. According to the usual practice, the gold exchange was only open for business for half a day in the morning. Trading began at 8:30 in the morning. As for the bid price, it has tended to fall, but there have been two taels of twists and turns from time to time. From morning to noon, the total is two taels. Looking back, the foreign exchange seems to be trending 折. Banks have mutual entries and exits. Interbank transactions within the market are very strong in sales. If Yuan Mao Yong, Fuyu, Yongfeng, etc. are the same. All buyers are only套頭 in addition to the commodity, and the rest are retail investors. People's hearts are not good here. It can be seen that from the beginning of the morning, the market opened low, probably in response to yesterday's silver price increase. Large investors such as投機followed the idea of selling, and broke the 80 tael mark. However, there were times when it was hovering around 80 taels. The spot market was usually running flat, and the phase标递增 increased by about 13 taels. When the market closed in the afternoon, it was speculated that the 大条 might continue to rise.</p>
<p>The buying sentiment was strong and the落 lowered three taels and sixty. The December bid price opened at 581 taels and three qian, a decrease of one tael and eight qian. 大条勿更 the silver price plus one-quarter (毛盘 initially around 81 taels, then 82 taels, transactions were not prosperous). Later, from 81 taels high to two taels, there were a few buyers. Then, due to the sale of Yuan Mao Yong, Zhifeng Yongyongfeng, etc., it immediately fell to within 80 taels, which was 79 taels, four or five qian at 8:30. And the British Gold Bank in December did a deal of 174,375. After entering,套头 etc. bought in and raised it by one tael. When the shilling was announced, the price was 80 taels and seven qian, and there was no change in the internal three 平. However, the buying sentiment in the market was not fresh. Fuyu, Yuanyong, and retail investors all had to dispose of it. In a moment, it was cut by two taels to 78 taels and eight or nine qian. At that time,套头 etc. entered again, and only after more than ten minutes, it was raised by one tael at 9:20 to 80 taels, and the British gold in January was eaten from Taiwan at 17.5. After the recovery, Yongfeng, Fuyu, Yuan Mao Yong, Yu Da, etc. all had to compete for sales, and the foreign exchange became even more relaxed. Datong once sold 174,275 in December, and the market situation felt even more depressed and fell by one tael. At 9:30, it was 78 taels and four qian. Afterwards, there was a slight turn, but the trend turned upward, so Xinhong, Gu Li, Wanxing, Tong Taichang, and 套头 etc. slightly chased in, so it jumped up by more than two taels. After 10:30, it was counted as 80 taels and seven or eight qian. At this time, Macari et al. bought British gold money of 74,375 in December, and moved back and forth around 80 taels. At 11 o'clock, Chengfeng Yong, etc. bought and rose上一 tael, and the British gold in January was sold at 17.5 or 174,275. At 11:20, it rose to 81 taels. Hengxing, etc. slightly disposed of it, and then the retail multi-heads also spit it out, so it fell by one tael. However, people's hearts were confused and helpless. At 11:30, the market was closed, and it closed at 79 taels and five qian, which was three taels and eight qian lower than last Saturday. Hengxing, Jin'an, and retail investors also dragged in, and it suddenly pulled up to 80 taels.</p>
<p>The price of the照 was revealed by 撳 forty taels Xu Cha. The largest price was 81 taels, and the smallest price was 78 taels and four qian, with a difference of three taels and six qian. The opening price of the first article was one tael and three qian, and the closing price was 80 taels and two qian. The revealed price was still 619 taels and eight qian, which was 撳 about forty taels. After that, the afternoon of thirty-nine taels closed at forty taels.</p>
<p>投机大户 The intention of throwing is very strong. In interbank transactions, Shunli, Chengfeng Yong, Jin'an, Xinhong, and Tong Taichang have bought in. The套头 of goods dragged away a lot. Zhifeng Yong, Da Decheng, Hengxing, etc. went in and out from time to time. Yongfeng, Fuyu, Yuan Mao Yong, Yufa Yong, Yu Da, and Yuanxing Yong sold their positions. Moreover, retail multi-heads all had to sell. The Dalian gang asked more than they supplied, but the number was not large, only 500 条 were sold and more than 100 条 were sold. The Guangdong gang rarely came out and looked like they were robbing hats.</p>

As for the British, American, and Japanese exchange rates, the domestic market initially remained stable, but as the gold market was already showing signs of weakness, breaking through the 80 tael mark, it also tended to loosen. Due to a slight recovery in the auctioned gold price, it managed to hold its ground.

<p>Yesterday's securities market saw active trading in various bond futures, with prices rising sharply and buying and selling being quite lively in both the front and back markets.

The 9-year customs duty was the most sought-after in the market, with the largest price increase. The current month's futures reached a maximum of 71 yuan, and although it retreated slightly afterwards, it was still 2.4 yuan higher than last week. The December futures also rose by 2.1 yuan.

<h3 id="e140">Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Extremely Scattered <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is sluggish and extremely scattered. Most are psychologically expecting a decline because the sales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn are too slow, and the bottom stock is thick, so the market atmosphere is very weak. However, there is still a lack of new sellers, and both the long and short sides are taking a wait-and-see approach to await changes. Therefore, the recent situation has been quite stagnant.</p>
<p>The human-marked clear price opened in the previous market, and the human spirit was scattered because the US cotton was tired for four days, and the near-month fell by one, two, and three cents. The distant month was flat. In the afternoon, Rongxing Company sold the current month alone, falling by three cents, and the distant month rose by one or two cents. The total transaction statistics for the day were 7,500 bales. It was found that Rongxing sold 700 bales, Jifeng 700 bales, and the rest 200-300 bales. Gongtai bought 800 bales, Tianjiang 800 bales, Shenji 500 bales, Yikang 450 bales, and the rest 200-300 bales. The closing price of the human standard is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The spot sales are still active, and the spot yarn sales are still good. It was found that the total number of husbands and helpers bought by all gangs on the day was 1,917 bales, and the market was flat. Among the guest gangs, Sichuan entered 620 bales, the mainland entered 520 bales, Yunnan entered 390 bales, Jiangxi entered 45 bales, Wuhu entered 60 bales, Changsha entered 57 bales, and miscellaneous gangs entered 100 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market is flat. The US cotton rose by 150 pounds when it was lower, and the tone has already returned by 50 pounds. Most of the general shorts have offset it directly. Recently, new shorts are watching the environment is not good, and they do not dare to sell rashly, and the source of Han Road is still lacking, so the market atmosphere is relatively firm, and it is difficult to fall for a while. However, the factories have purchased 350,000 pieces of US and Indian cotton, all of which are absorbed by Japanese factories in December the most. Therefore, the attitude of Japanese factories is calm and there is no search for spot cotton in the market.</p>
<p>The Han Standard is quiet and firm. The opening of the Han Standard's previous market was softer because the US cotton was slightly tired by 5 pounds. It fell by 1, 2, and 3 cents, and the market hardened again. The trading in the field was very clear. The near-month fell by 5 points and the distant month was flat. In the afternoon, each month rose slightly by 5 points. Both the long and short sides took a wait-and-see attitude. The total transaction statistics for the day were 17,600 dan. It was found that Gongtai sold 1,700 dan, Rongxing 2,500 dan, Shenchang 2,100 dan, and Yiyu 1,100 dan. Shenda bought 1,700 dan, Tongxing 1,000 dan, and the rest 6800 dan.

<p>Mumbai stopped the market due to the time, and the business was affected by the slight export of Omra flower and Pingguoer's new flower. The local family had a slight purchase. On the whole, the surface base was not smooth. As of Friday, the daily demand for trade was 24,500 bales, and the Chinese demand was quiet.

<p>Liverpool had very good spot demand last week. Futures initially rose with US cotton, and then fluctuated. The price decline was due to cotton farmers repeating hedging and bulls closing positions. However, mainland trade immediately recovered. The weekend market was slightly calm. The Egyptian cotton market continued to be firm.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Grain, River-Down Rice Market Sales Cheerful and Rising <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province Guest Helper Purchase ··· Yang Xian rises very sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of the inland area of Zhabei turned scarce, only 20. The sales in this street are very cheerful. The price of new grain has risen by 20 cents due to the strong reports from the producing market and the frequent entry of Zhejiang customers. The special top has reached 15 yuan. The remaining ordinary goods have also been raised by 20 cents. The current price of Hangzhou rice is higher than that of this port. Although the harvest in Zhejiang Province this year is abundant, the population is large and it is difficult to offset each other. Therefore, taking advantage of the decline in rice prices in Jiangsu and Anhui, they have slightly increased their accumulation. Therefore, inland rice merchants have recently transported directly to Hangzhou, resulting in a reduction in arrivals at this port and a frequent market. The thin rice opened high at 14 yuan 3 corners, and the source was not much, with a slight improvement of 1 corner. Yang Xian's buying interest was high. The price of the two thin pieces in this question rose sharply by half a yuan, reaching 12 yuan 2 corners, and the trend was very good. Du Jian's sales were also active, but not as good as Yang Xian's. It opened high at 12 yuan 5 corners, and the spectrum was good for 2 corners. The port's guest Xian was tight for 1 corner, and the market transaction was only a small number of retail inquiries. Bian Yuan was good for 2 corners and the appetite was active. The special high price was 15 yuan 7 corners.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than a dozen people arrived from various gangs in South Shanghai, and the market sales tended to be better. Changxi North Japonica rice was very active in going out, and the price was good for 1 corner and a half. The top opened at 14 yuan and a half. The large plate of Su Tong white Japonica rice was the same as the previous day without rising or falling. Tongli did not open at 12 yuan, 5 or 6 corners. Bai Ge, a variety of South Road Jing and Liantang, arrived, although Lian, but it was a small ticket, and the sales were normal. The high goods reported a settlement, and the medium and second grades saw a slight increase. The top opened at 13 yuan, 8 or 9 corners. Du Jian's situation was extremely good, and the store sales were special. Yang Jian had customers inquiring and was also very lively. The prices all rose by 2 or 3 corners. Bian Yuan turned from stable to firm. The special Chang gang opened at 15 yuan, 4 or 5 corners. Yin Yuan wine blanks continued to enter, and the transaction was not much, and the market was firm. The top made 14 yuan and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Guest Xian is only digested in Xiamen <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the guest Xian still did not improve. Although there were no large shipments arriving at the port, the River-Down goods had reached the peak of arrival, and the Benke office's intention was to wait and see the blocking opportunity. Moreover, the townships in this street no longer inquired about the guest Xian because the price of Du Jian was cheap, and the guest helpers only had one helper in Xiamen to digest. The North Gang had been inactive for a long time, and recently they had slightly selected high-body goods to pack and leave. Therefore, the market was very tired after the market, and the price was set at 2 corners. Later, the Xiamen gang bought 3,000 bags of Jiangxi machine early at a small price, and the market began to stabilize. The Jiangxi machine early sold more than 2,000 bags at a price of 10 yuan, 9 cents to 1 corner, and 100 bags of machine late at a price of 11 yuan, 6 corners. However, the Yuan rice was stable because the River-Down Du Yuan did not arrive much, and the rice quality was not as good as the guest Yuan, so the Gan and Xiang machine Yuan were welcomed by this street and customers. Yesterday, 250 bags of Jiangxi machine Yuan were traded at a price of 16 yuan, 3 corners and 7 cents to 16 yuan. 150 bags of Hunan machine Yuan were traded at a price of 15 yuan and 7 corners and 7 cents. It was also slightly softened by the guest Xian.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Powder Market is even more Tired and Unable to Fall <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the powder market in the morning and afternoon, the market in each month was even more tired and unbearable. The size factory is 　in the actual sales is sluggish. It has been more than a month since there was no large-scale sales field, and the reported price of foreign wheat has also seen a low step. Yesterday, the reported price was also small, 2, 3 cents, etc. Therefore, factories such as Fuxin Fufeng have been issuing files in various periods, near and far, in the past few days, between 500,000. In the long-term, foreign short-sellers also frequently add codes, so all of the hearts are consistently rushing out, and the market road has no way to save it. The latter steps are difficult to return and vibrate if the north sales are not smooth. As a result, this month is 2 points and 2 li half smaller than the previous week, December is 2 points and 7 li half smaller, January is 2 points and 7 li half smaller, and February to April are all 2 points and 2 li half smaller.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Period Wheat Market Consistently Sharp Fall <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the period wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market in each month was still falling steadily. The reported price of foreign wheat was already 2, 3 cents smaller, and it was widely rumored in the market that a factory had sold another Australian No. 2 white wheat contract for only 4 liang 4 qian and a half of Shen Yuan. The bulls were increasingly panicked, and the factory's sales were even more 　, resulting in a consistent sharp fall in each period, near and far. After watching the next step, if the foreign 　 is still small, the factory will still sell it, and I am afraid that it will continue to fall. As a result, this month is 5 points smaller than the previous week, December is 4 points smaller, January is 6 points and 2 smaller, February is 5 points and 3 smaller, March is 4 points smaller, and April is 5 points smaller. The spot wheat market is still stagnant, and there are few high-quality goods, and the factory does not handle medium-grade goods, resulting in no opening of the whole market. Fuxin has a new ship of foreign wheat, and there are still 23 batches that can arrive in Japan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market of foreign banks in this port still tended to be tired and quiet. Since the Yokohama Japanese silk market crashed at the end of last week, the overseas market silk sales have not moved. The Shanghai port telegrams did not turn to the Shanghai market yesterday, and the atmosphere was quiet. Only Dachang Jin Yihe and Jinmasi brand top-of-the-line 7 li white dry silk was 30 bags, and the price was 665 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Double Palace Silk Factory Also Announced Closure <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>There are a total of 106 single and double palace silk factories in this port, all of which are members of the Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association. Because the silk sales in Europe and the United States are not good, the silk factory's business has suffered losses. On the 19th of last month, an interim emergency meeting of the industry was held, and it was unanimously decided to suspend business and wait for government relief. As of the 31st of last month, all silk factories in Shanghai have been shut down. There are a total of 7 double palace silk factories in the Shanghai port, all of which have joined the Industry Association General Assembly resolution and must be observed. Therefore, the seven double palace silk factories, including Hongshunlun, Xinlun, Jinglun, Fulun, Ruilun, Jinlun, and Dalun, all 　 stopped working at the end of last month.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market in this port had only half a day of transactions for the English banks because of the Western merchants' autumn racing season, and the market situation was not lively. The Russian Bank Assistance Association saw 　sales of Xingmen black tea and Gongxi green tea smoothly, and the market plate was unchanged from last week. Although the Morocco market had telegrams ordering Jane eyebrow needle eyebrows and other items, the recognized price was too low, and the market was still difficult to turn around.</p>

According to the Xiamen electricity office, the price has risen by 1 yuan again. This 　 has little stock, and the selling price has been heard to follow the rise.

<p>Selling Goods Coarse Sand Market Also Down</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market lacked telegrams from the producing area. The public market drew a plate of Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white.

The new arrival of goods failed to be shipped on Monday and was drawn at 7 liang 8 qian and a half. The market image was also weak.

<p>The Yangtze River Gang Adds Credit Daily</p>
<p>The fine oblique falling wind was very popular yesterday in the cloth factory. The previous rising momentum was too strong, and the actual sales turned sluggish. The spot goods increased sharply, making it difficult to support.

<h3 id="e160">Chen Ying Shi Memorial Tower <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Completion ceremony held at 10:00 AM yesterday, with deeply sorrowful speeches from Mayor Zhang and others. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, the completion ceremony for the memorial tower of the late General Chen Ying Shi, Military Governor of Shanghai, was held at the triangular area between Ximen Fang Xie Road and Zhonghua Road in this city. The streets around Ximen were bustling with traffic, marking a grand occasion. Details of the day are recorded separately below. The memorial tower was built with funds raised by Chairman Chiang, Mayor Zhang, and Mr. Huang Yingbai. The tower's appearance is completely in the Chinese style, with an overall height of eighty feet. The highest point is shaped like a giant cauldron, gilded in gold. The entire structure is constructed of steel and reinforced concrete, with an exterior resembling natural stone, making it exceptionally majestic. Inside, a spiral staircase allows visitors to ascend and admire the surrounding scenery, making it an unprecedented structure in this city.</p>
<p>Attendees and Guests: Those who participated in the ceremony included Mr. Huang Yingbai, representative of National Government Chairman Chiang; Mr. Jiao Yitang, representative of Legislative Yuan President Hu; Mayor Zhang; Central Committee members Li Shizeng and Li Liejun, as well as He Yaozu, Liu Jiwen, Yu Hongjun, Tang Naikang, Zhu Yan, Pan Gongzhan, Shen Yi, Yuan Liang, Hu Hongji, Xu Pei璜, Huang Boqiao, Xi Dingmo, Sun Baorong, Xu Weizhen, Ren Guangyu, Chen Xunyong, Yang Hu, Su Xianyang, Wu Kaixian, Zhu Yingpeng, Wang Yansong, Fan Zhengbo, Tong Xingbai, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Guo Chengen, Chen Shiguang, Wu Zhenxiu, Chu Fucheng, Xu Xiuzhi, Zhou Peizhen, Yin Ru, Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, and foreign guests such as Kikuchi Ryoichi, totaling over a thousand people.</p>
<p>Family Members of Martyr Chen: In addition to the guests, family members of Mr. Chen Yingqi, including Ying Shi's wife Chen Lanshi, Chen Qinshi, Chen Lifu, Chen Ganfu, Chen Zhenfu, Chen Qianfu, Chen Hanfu, and Chen Xizeng, totaling over twenty people, were also present.</p>
<p>Order of the Completion Ceremony: (1) Opening—all stand at attention; (2) Music; (3) Singing of the Party anthem; (4) Bowing three times to the Party flag, national flag, and the portrait of the Leader; (5) Chairman respectfully reads the Leader's will; (6) Silence; (7) Chairman delivers the opening address; (8) Music; (9) Unveiling ceremony; (10) Speeches; (11) Music; (12) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang's Speech: After the opening, Chairman Mayor Zhang delivered a speech, briefly stating: "Today is November 3rd, the nineteenth year of the Republic of China. On this day nineteen years ago, Mr. Chen Ying Shi, following the Leader's plan, led our revolutionary comrades, disregarding the sacrifice of their lives, to bravely restore Shanghai and establish the foundation for the revolution. His great achievements, broadly speaking, are related to the Republic of China; narrowly speaking, they are related to Shanghai. How deeply felt is this relationship since Mr. Ying Shi's martyrdom. Since Mr. Ying Shi's martyrdom, we have wanted to have something in Shanghai to commemorate him, to serve as a reminder. It was not until the nineteenth year of the Republic of China that we were able to build this small memorial tower for Mr. Chen in Shanghai. Looking back now, amidst our joy, there is infinite sorrow and infinite shame. Today, you gentlemen share the same sentiment and have graced us with your presence to participate in the ceremony. Several of you have come from afar, from Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. Your spirit of admiring martyrs is particularly admirable. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek originally planned to attend the ceremony but was unable to come due to pressing matters. He specially requested Mr. Huang Yingbai to deliver a speech on his behalf, so today we will also ask Mr. Huang to share his thoughts. As for the origin of building this memorial tower, Mr. Huang and I reported on it when the groundbreaking ceremony was held on May 18th, so there is no need to repeat it. All the engineering was completely entrusted to Mr. Shen Junjunyi, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, and Mr. Dong Dayou. Mr. Xue Jun Cixin supervised the construction on our behalf. Since the groundbreaking, everything has proceeded according to the scheduled plan, so we were able to complete it today on the scheduled date. The tower is eighty feet tall, and most of it is in the Chinese architectural style, but it also incorporates foreign architectural elements. The materials are almost all domestic goods. Entering the tower door, you can climb to the top along the stairs. If you use a surveying instrument at the top of the tower to test it, you can see that the tower is very straight and has no slight inclination. It can be considered the tallest building among the public buildings in this city, and it cost only over 10,000 yuan. When we ascend this tower, we can not only commemorate the martyrs but also have a clear view of the entire city. It is not without benefit to municipal administration. Among the guests today, there are many old friends or colleagues of Mr. Ying Shi. Seeing this scene, they must have many thoughts. I don't need to say more. Please express your thoughts to commemorate him."</p>
<p>Huang Yingbai's Speech: After Mayor Zhang's speech, Mr. Huang, former mayor, representing Chairman Chiang, delivered a speech, briefly stating: "The greatness of Mr. Ying Shi's character and the hardships of creating the Republic of China were described in detail by me when this memorial tower's foundation stone laying ceremony was held on May 18th. Today, at this opening ceremony, it was originally planned for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to attend and deliver a speech, so I did not prepare to speak. Unexpectedly, yesterday I received a telegram from Chairman Chiang stating that he was unable to arrive as scheduled due to matters and asked me to deliver a speech on his behalf, so I cannot but repeat a few words. However, since I am speaking on behalf of him, then what I say can only be taken as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek speaking here. This memorial tower was selected to have its foundation laid on the day Mr. Ying Shi opposed the imperial system and sacrificed himself for the country. It was also selected to have its opening ceremony on the day Mr. Ying Shi was almost in danger but restored Shanghai. This kind of commemorative method cannot but be said to contain a profound meaning. What is the meaning? It is to let the gloriously dead know that the martyrs did not create the Republic of China easily, to constantly observe things and feel the need to continue to work hard to complete the martyrs' unfulfilled wishes. It is neither to comfort the private feelings of one or two people nor merely to enhance the appearance of Shanghai. However, what are the unfulfilled wishes of Mr. Ying Shi? I dare to give a simple answer: under the Leader's guidance, strive to realize the Three Principles of the People in China. I still remember that Mr. Ying Shi, during the secret work era, once discussed the Three Principles of the People with his comrades. He said that since it is called the Three Principles of the People, we must first understand that the word 'people' refers to all the people. If it does not include all the people, it is not enough to speak of nationalism. If a part of the people occupies a special position and exercises special power, it is not enough to speak of democracy. If a few people live and the majority die or wither, it is not enough to speak of people's livelihood. This is one saying. He also said that nationalism is the ultimate goal of our party, and democracy and people's livelihood are the only ways to achieve the goal. This is another saying. We can know the location of Mr. Ying Shi's unfulfilled wishes based on his two sayings during his lifetime. Before the Xinhai Revolution, the party's ideology was not widely spread in the country, so at the time of the Xinhai Revolution, most people saw that nationalism was listed first in the party's ideology and thought that nationalism was only the solution to the Manchu-Han problem. I do not know that our party's nationalism is by no means so narrow. The Leader's will clearly states: 'To seek freedom and equality for the Chinese nation,' so nationalism is actually the ultimate goal of our party. However, to seek national freedom in the international arena, we must first seek the establishment of democracy and the prosperity of people's livelihood within the country. The establishment of democracy is the cause of political progress, and the prosperity of people's livelihood is the result of economic development. There has never been a nation with chaotic politics and backward economy that can seek freedom and equality in the international arena. Therefore, Mr. Ying Shi said that democracy and people's livelihood are the only ways to achieve the goal. Now, let me explain the three meanings of nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood separately: (1) Nationalism: Mr. Ying Shi said that if it does not include all the people, it is not enough to speak of nationalism. How can all the people be united? From a political and legal point of view, it is necessary to maintain the peace and unity of the country. From a social point of view, it is necessary to cultivate the spirit of love and sincerity. The former is the policy of the current government, and the latter is the late Leader's teachings. Following this teaching and based on this policy, we can proceed, so that in the villages and communities, there will be the beauty of mutual friendship and assistance, watching out for each other, and helping each other in times of illness. In the country, we can achieve the effect of unity from top to bottom, with one heart and one mind, striving together for this ultimate goal. Being able to be friends and help each other will never lead to mutual harm and trouble. To put it in today's common language, it is the theory of mutual assistance. Being able to have the same heart and mind will never lead to diverging paths. To put it in today's common language, it is the theory of cooperation. I deeply hope that the whole country will support the policy of unity and peace with the spirit of love and sincerity. Let the past be like yesterday's death, and let the future be like today's birth. I am willing to encourage all my comrades together. (2) Democracy: Mr. Ying Shi said that it is not enough to speak of democracy if people in special positions exercise special powers. In a country, having special positions and special powers is the greatest misfortune and the greatest danger. This great misfortune and this danger are not only suffered by those who are not special, but those who are special will also personally suffer. The nobles of the former Qing Dynasty and the warlords of the Republic of China are proof of this. The people of the whole country can be roughly divided into four categories. Guanzi said that scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants are the four classes of people in a country. If one of the four is missing, the country cannot stand. It is evident that the ancients had the theory of equality among the four classes of people. If the four classes of people do not have their own foundations and do not have equal opportunities for development, it is not enough to speak of establishing a country. I hope that during the period of political tutelage</p>
<h3 id="e161">Right: Zhang Qun (Center): Ying Shi's Wife (Left): Huang Fu (Our Newspaper) <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>First pay attention to this and gradually cultivate the habit and experience of equal participation in politics among the four classes of people so that the principle of democracy can be fully realized. (3) People's Livelihood: Mr. Ying Shi said that it is not enough to speak of people's livelihood if a few people live and the majority die. To seek the livelihood of the majority, we must ask the majority to move forward together on the path of economic construction. The obstacles to the first step of economic construction are the incitement of the Communist Party, the disturbance of bandits, irregular actions among groups, and the undisciplined behavior of the military and political circles. The government should, of course, bear full responsibility for removing these obstacles. At the same time, the elements of economic construction, the way to work diligently and live frugally, cannot but be expected from the joint efforts of all the people. Those who are diligent are hardworking, and those who live frugally are thrifty. Being hardworking and thrifty is enough to speak of economic construction. Otherwise, if they are lazy at work and compete in luxury, not only will the principle of people's livelihood be far from the topic, but the impact will induce the economic invasion policies of countries around the world to penetrate deeply into the country and cause disharmony in the world. This is most regrettable. Today, taking the opportunity of the completion ceremony of the Chen Ying Shi Memorial Tower, and also at a time when the whole country is rejoicing in peace and the military affairs of the last act of unity, which has suffered the most hardship and made the greatest sacrifices, has completely ended, I do not mind taking the time to tell you all my innermost feelings.</p>
<p>Now that I have finished speaking on behalf of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, I want to return to Huang Yingbai and talk about the previous section of the speech on behalf of him was not because Chairman Chiang had telegrammed me, but it was not a fiction of my own. I know that the history of the combination of Chiang Kai-shek and Ying Shi and my usual discussions with Chiang Kai-shek know that what he wants to say today is roughly the same. Why? The prerequisite for nationalism is that all the people have the spirit of love and sincerity, and Chiang Kai-shek has often inscribed the four characters of 'love and sincerity' when he inscribed words for people in recent years. This proves that it is not my fiction. First, the prerequisite for democracy is that the four classes of people are equal, and there are no special positions and no special powers in the whole country. This was recently said with emotion by Chiang Kai-shek when he returned from the battlefield and held a commemorative week in the capital. This proves that it is not my fiction. Second, the prerequisite for the meaning of people's livelihood is to remove the obstacles to economic construction, and Chiang Kai-shek began to clear the Communists after he established the capital in Nanjing. After returning from the battlefield this time, he also paid attention to suppressing bandits. This also proves that it is not my fiction. Third, I also remember that in the winter of the year of Jiazi, when I was in charge of politics in Beiping, Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram from Guangzhou, briefly stating: 'The political situation in the north has changed suddenly, and your brother expected that your brother must have participated. The telegrams sent in recent days to eliminate the war and clean up the old palace are indeed what your brother did. Hearing this, I was moved to tears. Your brother is now doing his best to train soldiers in Guangzhou, so that the national revolution can be completed and the Leader's ideology can be realized and Ying's brother's unfulfilled wishes can be extended, then our Qi's heart and traces can be made clear to the world.' Therefore, I dare to believe that Chiang Kai-shek's spirit for the party and the country has been the same for decades. When Shanghai people warmly praised the world's talents during the Xinhai Restoration, Ying Shi did a great deal, and he also made great contributions to the country. I have described this in detail on May 18th at the foundation stone laying ceremony. I hope that all the old friends and comrades of Mr. Ying Shi and all the people of Shanghai will not change their original intentions and will support Chiang Kai-shek with the spirit of supporting Mr. Ying Shi in those years to fulfill Mr. Ying Shi's unfulfilled wishes (to follow the Leader's teachings and realize the Three Principles of the People in China). This is the blessing of the country and the fortune of our party. Furthermore, the establishment of this memorial tower has been laborious for the Shanghai Municipal Government to sponsor, so it can be completed as scheduled. Also, today's opening ceremony has been warmly attended by comrades, and there are also those who have come from afar. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone.</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan's Speech: Following that, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, briefly stating that the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters is greatly honored to attend the completion ceremony of the Ying Shi Memorial Tower today. The three gentlemen Chiang, Huang, and Zhang donated funds to build this magnificent memorial tower, and their intention is not simply to commemorate Mr. Ying Shi's past achievements. They also want to take this opportunity to encourage all the comrades who died later in our party and the revolutionary people of the whole country to rise up and emulate Mr. Ying Shi. Mr. Yingbai has already mentioned this, but there are many words and deeds in Mr. Ying Shi's life that can be used as our example. Now, I dare to put forward the two most important points as a warning to all comrades. First, Mr. Ying Shi is the most faithful person to the Leader and obeys the Leader without changing. After the failure of the second revolution in the year of Gui Chou, some comrades in our party doubted the Leader's ideology or policies, not to mention the people. However, Mr. Ying Shi firmly believed that only by believing in Sun Yat-sen's ideology and obeying his leadership can a new China be built. The long letter he wrote to Mr. Huang Keqiang clearly shows that Mr. Ying Shi's ability to struggle for the revolution to the end and achieve something lies entirely in this firm belief. Mr. Dai Jitao said that if there is no mutual trust, there will be no mutual trust. If we want to emulate Mr. Ying Shi, we should first emulate his behavior of firmly believing in ideology and obeying the leader. Second, the Leader's legacy once said that everyone should aim to serve and not to seize. Mr. Ying Shi strictly abides by the discipline of the group and engages in struggle to achieve the goal of serving the people, but he never wants to seize any benefits from the people for his own private possession. This can be proved by his life history and the situation of his family after his death. If we join this party and want to use this combined group to obtain special benefits without intending to serve the people, it is definitely not what we should emulate from Mr. Ying Shi. I hope that in the future, all those who admire this memorial tower will at least learn the two most valuable spirits of Mr. Ying Shi, then the construction of the Three Principles of the People can be successful in the end, and the construction of this memorial tower will not be in vain.</p>
<p>Speeches by Guests: In addition, Central Committee members Li Liejun and Li Shizeng, Legislative Committee member Jiao Yitang and other gentlemen all gave extremely sorrowful speeches, the general meaning of which was that the construction of this tower is to commemorate Mr. Chen Ying Shi's past achievements and to encourage those who died later to take responsibility for realizing the Three Principles of the People. The ceremony was completed after eleven o'clock.</p>
<p>Another message: President of the Judicial Yuan Wang Chonghui was unable to come to Shanghai to participate in the grand ceremony due to matters and sent a telegram to Mayor Zhang to express his apology. The original telegram is as follows: Shanghai Municipal Office, Mayor Zhang Yuejun Brother Xun Jian. Today is the completion ceremony of the Chen Gong Ying Shi Memorial Tower. Your brother was unable to go to Shanghai to participate due to matters and sent a telegram to apologize. Please forgive me. Wang Chonghui Jiang Yin.</p>

<p>The Municipal Government Announced Yesterday</p>
<p>The Municipal Government previously decided to borrow a small amount of rent to raise the short-term tariff treasury bonds for the 19th year in accordance with the order, and since September 30th, it has been borrowing and collecting for two months by the Finance Bureau and various collection offices. However, the total amount of rent in this city in two months is about one million or more, excluding the exchange of tariff treasury bonds, there is a slight balance. Now, after the Municipal Public Bond Solicitation Committee suggested exchanging it for municipal public bonds, the Municipal Construction Discussion Committee decided to pass it. The Municipal Government stated that the above-mentioned method of exchanging for municipal public bonds does not increase the burden on the citizens, and municipal construction can be expected to be realized soon. It has replied and ordered the Finance Bureau to comply with it. (The Municipal Government's announcement can be found in the advertising column)</p>

<p>Recovering Lost Shipping Rights</p>
<p>The port of Weihaiwei has historically had no Chinese ships operating, and shipping rights have long been in foreign hands. Due to the presence of British warships stationed at Liugong Island, and officials and trading houses based in Weihaiwei, Shanghai-based Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire both dispatched formal passenger ships on regular routes. These operated on average thirteen or fourteen times a month. Now that Weihaiwei has been taken over by our country, and the northern coast of China is without any domestic ships, there are plans to launch a shipping service. What we have heard is recorded below.</p>
<p>British Ships Cease Operation of Mail. Correspondence and mail between Shanghai and Weihaiwei have historically been entrusted to British trading companies such as Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire due to the lack of regularly scheduled Chinese ships operating from this port. Now that the British government has returned Weihaiwei, British merchants such as Butterfield &amp; Swire continue to operate ships to Weihaiwei, but they have ceased carrying mail. Currently, the postal authorities are</p>
<p>Temporarily Entrusting Non-Regular Chinese Ships to Transport Mail. Chinese Ships Planning Shipping Routes. Weihaiwei has been taken over by our country. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, being a state-run shipping company, has now assigned the "Xinfeng" and "Xinming" ships of the Northern Shipping Fleet to operate in Weihaiwei. They plan to follow the Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson's northern China routes and add Weihaiwei as an additional port of call. The business department of the company is already planning this. As Weihaiwei lacks a branch office, they plan to set up a management office to handle cargo transport and passenger services. The first step will be to liaise with the postal authorities.</p>
<p>Requesting Subsidies for the China Merchants. For the sake of opening a Shanghai-</p>
<p>Weihaiwei route, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is planning comprehensively. As there are fewer goods and passengers at that location, they will begin by taking over the mail transport formerly handled by British ships. The business department of the company has already sent a letter to the Postal Administration, stating that they will handle the transportation of mail to Weihaiwei and requesting, in addition to transport fees, an annual subsidy of two thousand taels from the postal authorities to support business operations. This letter has been sent, and they will proceed with launching the shipping service as soon as a reply is received.</p>

If this conference can reduce the tax prices of domestic goods as requested by the Joint Association, then the efforts of this conference are valuable. Otherwise, no matter how great it is, it is in vain. Regarding railway administration, the Ministry of Railways, in view of the excessive ferry charges at Pukou (each ton of goods transported from the Coal Port to Pukou requires six yuan), plans to build a ferry so that vehicles do not have to unload goods at the riverside and can be transported across the Pujiang River by ferry. At that time, the ferry fee for each ton of goods will be only six jiao.

<h3 id="e173">Situation of Silk Mill Workers' Unemployment <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai silk mills have suffered a sharp decline in sales of foreign raw silk. Their funds have been depleted and they can no longer maintain operations. There is a consensus to suspend operations. After investigation by Shen Huachen, chairman and committee member of the Shanghai Silk Mill Trade Association, it was found that there are 106 silk mills in Shanghai. If all of them suspend operations, more than 100,000 male and female workers will have no way to make a living, which will have a significant impact on social order. He specially advised the larger mills, such as Ruilun, to continue operations to maintain the status quo. As the overseas silk market is becoming increasingly sluggish and there is no way to maintain support, Ruilun and other mills all suspended operations on the 31st of last month, and the situation is becoming more serious. After reporting the suspension of work by various factories, the standing committee members of the Silk Mill Trade Association, with Chairman Shen and others having gone to Beijing to petition, were unable to determine when government relief funds would be issued and the situation was fraught with danger. They telegraphed Chairman Shen Huachen at the Capital Central Hotel in the capital the day before yesterday, reporting everything. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce also paid special attention to the sudden increase of more than 100,000 unemployed workers in Shanghai due to the closure of all silk mills and sent a special commissioner to Shanghai to investigate the situation.</p>

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Chengdu General Chamber of Commerce yesterday stating: "Regarding the JiangSu Match Industry Joint Association, Chen Jiuru, former associate of the Yingchang Match Company and currently the director of operations of the Great China Match Company, has been dispatched to Yibin, Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places to investigate the match industry. Please send a letter to the local chamber of commerce to introduce him so that he can receive guidance at any time. In view of the fact that the Jiangsu match industry is currently resisting the Swedish match invasion, it has united the Zaichang, Hongsheng, and China companies into a large organization in order to consolidate its strength. This is the origin of the Great China Match Company's initiation. This time, Chen Jiuru is specially dispatched to various places in Sichuan Province to conduct investigations. It is related to the development of domestic products and the resistance to foreign monopolies. His mission is very important. In accordance with the circumstances in the letter, we have prepared a letter to respectfully request your esteemed association to provide assistance at any time so that this trip can achieve its intended goals. We would be grateful. Respectfully, to the Chengdu General Chamber of Commerce Public Security Bureau for investigation."</p>
<h3 id="e176">Obtaining Overseas Passports Through Deception <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Strictly Crack Down to Prevent Being Deceived. Shanghai Public Security Bureau inspectors recently seized passports issued by the Singapore Consulate on a French mail ship from peddlers and merchants from Zhejiang who were going abroad to do business. The ages and circumstances did not match, and there was evidence of photo switching. The four peddlers and merchants were detained and taken to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>The clues for the crackdown originated from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's strict crackdown on passports for peddlers going abroad after the Municipal Government forwarded a strict order from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As a result, various peddlers and merchants had no way to apply for passports, but their desire to go abroad to do business was strong. Therefore, they sought help everywhere, resulting in hundreds of existing "agents" (i.e., those who arranged passports) trying to find ways. Later, they learned that it was easier to apply for passports from the issuing authorities in Guangdong Province, so they flocked to Guangdong to apply. The Guangdong Municipal Government, suspecting that the merchants were from Zhejiang and should apply for passports in Shanghai instead of traveling to Guangdong, inquired with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the truth and suspended issuing passports. However, the "agents" found out that the consulates in Nanyang islands, such as Singapore and Penang, were even more lenient in issuing passports. They purchased many photos of others with upright features and western clothing and went to the consulates in those places to apply, costing only seven yuan per passport (because this type of passport was not issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs but was a temporarily printed sheet of paper). After obtaining the passports, they returned to Shanghai and sold them, requiring only that the age be similar. They tore off the original photos, pasted on photos of the passport buyers, and added a forged round seal, making it difficult to detect even with careful examination. Many people have been able to go abroad through deception. This time, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau acted on a tip-off and went to investigate, successfully cracking down on the scheme.</p>
<p>Thoroughly Investigate the Comprador and Those Hiding Gold Bars. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau has recently received anonymous letters reporting that it has conducted several investigations, but there have been no clues. Furthermore, the peddlers and merchants who were willing to go abroad to do business have remained silent. After taking one of the arrested persons to the bureau and handing him over to the Third Section for interrogation, he confessed the hidden details and revealed who he had bought the passport from, a man surnamed Gao. Detectives were dispatched to arrest him, but he had already fled.</p>
<p>The "Agents" in Shanghai Have All Fled. Since this case occurred, the "agents" fled in fear of being implicated after hearing of Gao's arrest. The peddlers from Zhejiang who came to Shanghai to apply for passports and go abroad usually lived in the houses or exchange shops established by the "agents" (because the peddlers remitted the money they earned abroad to the "agents," who then remitted it back home. They never stayed in other hotels or inns, so they had good access to information). It is now reported that the Shanghai Public Security Bureau is still detaining the four peddlers and merchants and interrogating them closely, intending to thoroughly investigate and eliminate evil.</p>
<p>The Value of Passports and Tickets. Before the crackdown, it cost peddlers at most 220-230 yuan to entrust an "agent" to apply for a passport and purchase a ticket. Now, due to the strictness, the price has risen to 300-400 yuan for applying in other ports, yet people are still scrambling to do so.</p>
<p>Why Not Take a Ship from the Place Where the Passport is Issued? Because buying a ticket in ports such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Penang requires buying a third-class ticket, while buying a through ticket in Shanghai is cheaper than a third-class ticket by 30-40%. It is even cheaper to smuggle gold bars without a passport, but those with sufficient money are unwilling to take the risk.</p>
<p>What Will Happen Next? It is reported that the Shanghai Public Security Bureau is now strictly cracking down on this kind of matter, striving to eliminate it completely so as to prevent ignorant villagers from being deceived and to ensure public safety.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Heartbreaking Sight: Twenty-One Corpses <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Mortality Reached Thirty Percent</p>
<p>Cries Fill the Scene at the Morgue</p>
<p>Insufficient Prevention Beforehand</p>
<p>Authorities Should Seek Proper Handling Afterward</p>
<p>On the chillingly windy Republican Road yesterday, twenty-one corpses were laid out, their charred and disfigured state juxtaposed with the ashes and debris of the burned military uniforms, a heartbreaking sight that filled one with sorrow. Of these twenty-one corpses, fifteen have been identified. Excluding three children aged three and one, the rest were women who made a living through their own labor. Having been burned by the fire, their eyes and ears were indistinguishable, their bodies like charred charcoal. Cries filled the scene at the identification site, echoing each other. Onlookers could not help but feel a pang of grief. The day before yesterday, when the fire broke out, these female workers cried out to escape. Yesterday, the living mourned the corpses. During these twenty-four hours, the sounds of lamentation and weeping near the Fuchang Military Clothing Factory seemed to have been uninterrupted. The factory had a total of over a hundred female workers. About seven died in the hospital in the past two days. Adding the twenty-one corpses found at the fire site yesterday, the number of deaths due to the disaster has reached around twenty-eight. The number of remaining unknown deaths is not included. Therefore, the number of deaths in this incident accounts for at least 30% of the total number of workers, which is truly shocking.</p>
<p>Searching for Corpses in the Rubble. After the fire at the Third Fuchang Military Clothing Factory, the residents of Zhabei, because of the unusual disaster, all had a desire to witness the aftermath to widen their horizons. Therefore, yesterday, from morning to dusk, the number of onlookers on Republican Road was endless. The Fourth District Public Security Bureau specially hired twelve workers to sift through the rubble for corpses. From morning until dusk, a total of twenty-one corpses were found, mostly with incomplete clothing, withered hair, and terrifying faces. The timid dared not approach. When excavating the ashes, bricks, and tiles, there were police officers and members of the security corps directing and supervising. However, the families of the victims had already arrived at the fire site crying, eager to identify the bodies. Therefore, as soon as a corpse was found, the relatives gathered around. Husbands cried for their wives, and children cried for their mothers. Of the twenty-one corpses, except for three or four child corpses, the rest were mostly pitiful women.</p>
<p>Thirty Percent Died in the Fire. Workers moved the corpses one by one, placing them by the roadside for families to identify them. They were separated with lead sheets for identification and arranged in the order they were found. The names of the fifteen identified corpses are as follows: Wang Da Caizi, 18 years old, female, from Yancheng; Wang Yuan Shi, 44 years old, from Taizhou; Zhao Xiao Dangzi, 17 years old, female, from Yancheng; Jiang Liudi, 13 years old, female, from Tongzhou; Wang Cuilian, 12 years old, female; Peng Xiaoyang, 12 years old, female, from Yancheng; Guo Tian Shi, 42 years old, from Tongzhou; Guo Shoeszi, 5 years old; Wang Sun Shi, 26 years old, from Yancheng; Wang Hongzi, 5 years old; Wang Koufuchang, the tragic scene of the military uniform factory being destroyed (taken by Zhonghua); the tragic scene of the military uniform factory being destroyed (taken by Zhonghua); Z, 3 years old; Liu Sun Shi, 27 years old, from Yancheng; Guo Zhu Shi, 23 years old, from Yancheng; Chen Gengcheng, 3 years old; Mao Wang Shi, 23 years old, from Funing. The deceased in the hospital: One from the Red Cross Hospital, Lu Gao Shi. In addition to the two from the day before yesterday, the Pushan Hospital had Yuan Zhu Shi, 46 years old, from Yong, and Yuan Xiao Nu, 5 years old. Baolong Hospital: Chen Xia Shi and Wang Cailin. Currently, the known number of deaths is nearly thirty, which accounts for almost 30% of all the female workers in the factory. Over sixty were burned by the fire. Yesterday, there were still many people going to Pushan Hospital for follow-up examinations. An entire mother and daughter were burned to death. Most of those burned were women and children. Guo Tian Shi and Guo Shoeszi, mentioned above, are mother and daughter. Tian Shi was working and brought her daughter to the factory to play. Even more tragic was the case of Wang Sun Shi, Wang Hongzi, and Wang Kouzi, a mother and her two daughters, who all died in the fire at the same time. Wang Sun Shi's husband, Wang Shanting, a leather worker, lived at No. 3, Lane 2219, Meiyuan Road. Hongzi was five years old and Kouzi was three years old. Of the four members of the family, three have already died, which is no less than the collapse of the entire family in one fire. Mao Wang Shi, Wang Sun Shi, Kouzi, Hongzi, Liu Sun Shi, and Guo Tian Shi of the twenty-one corpses were reported by the 27th Bao, 11th Yuan Dibao to the court, which dispatched Prosecutor Yang accompanied by Examiner Shen to the scene to verify the cause of death and allow the families to collect the bodies separately. The remaining corpses will be verified later.</p>
<p>Lack of Preparedness Caused This Disaster. The magnitude of the disaster caused by this fire is truly rare in recent years. The losses of the Fuchang Military Clothing Factory, such as cotton, military uniforms, and buildings, are worth tens of thousands of yuan, but they are limited. However, the loss of life on the workers' side accounts for 30% of the total number of workers, and the fact that all the dead are women and children is even more tragic. The factory uses cotton to remake military uniforms, and the amount of cotton and clothing materials stored on weekdays is very large. The lack of fire-fighting equipment inevitably led to this disaster. The panic and confusion of the female workers upon seeing the fire was also expected. If more Taiping gates could be opened and there was more emergency training in peacetime, there might not have been so many deaths. It is said that the factory only has one back door staircase, which is very narrow, and a large amount of cotton and military uniforms are piled up. Even in normal times, there is hardly any space to turn around. It is easy to imagine the situation of being crowded and unable to move in a rush. Some workers who escaped said that the cause of the fire was a cigarette. However, after the fire broke out, the factory managers not only did not order the female workers to escape but temporarily closed the doors, as if afraid that the goods would be lost, leading to an uncontrollable situation. If this statement is accurate, then the dead are even more pitiful. There must be many similar factories in the city that are not properly equipped. It is hoped that the authorities can properly plan safety measures and ensure the safety of the workers.</p>

<p>Public Concession Dog Racing Track</p>
<h3 id="e182">Soon to be Completely Prohibited <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>According to the "Great American Evening Post", the British Consulate and the Municipal Council authorities have decided on the fate of Shanghai's dog racing venues. This morning (the 3rd), the British Consul-General, Mr. Brenan, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, and the Chief of Police, Mr. Read, met to decide that their aim is not only to suppress, but to completely prohibit it. All the members of the Municipal Council also agree with this move. This morning, a reporter specifically visited the British Consul-General, who stated that the British authorities do not approve of dog racing in Shanghai. If the Municipal Council takes measures to ban it, they will provide full assistance, as dog racing undoubtedly increases crime in the concession. Those who gamble large sums in dog racing venues often lose huge amounts of money and are driven to commit crimes. Therefore, it is necessary to prohibit dog racing. The decision on this matter was made at a meeting in the Consul-General's office this morning, and the Municipal Council is currently considering the methods. It is expected that the ban will be submitted for discussion at the next Council meeting and will be passed. During this morning's meeting, Mr. Fessenden and Mr. Read both expressed their opinions on dog racing and the position of the Municipal Council, requesting the Consul-General and the British authorities to support the closure of the dog racing venues. Mr. Brenan also explained the position of the British authorities and guaranteed their support. Subsequently, the reporter inquired whether a concrete plan had been agreed upon. Mr. Brenan replied that no plan had been agreed upon yet, and that the matter would be handled by the Municipal Council. He also stated that the two dog racing venues in the Public Concession are operated by British merchants. When they were first established, the British authorities did not expect the gambling craze to be so intense, nor did they expect that those who lost heavily in dog racing venues would engage in embezzlement and theft, leading to an increase in crime to today's level. Finally, when asked whether horse racing would also be banned, the British Consul-General replied that Mr. Fessenden and others did not mention this matter when they met at the consulate today. Subsequently, the reporter met with Mr. Fessenden, who stated that the prohibition of dog racing is inevitable, but the method still needs to be decided in the next Council meeting. Moreover, an official of the Municipal Council said that not only do the consuls oppose dog racing, but all the members of the Municipal Council also believe that dog racing is not in the interest of the citizens. Furthermore, according to Mr. Brenan and Mr. Fessenden, although the British authorities and the Municipal Council have decided to prohibit dog racing, they have no intention of making things difficult for the dog racing venues. Once a plan is decided, they will be given ample time to wind up their business.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Apprentice Beats Owner to Death <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Apprentice Flees in Fear of Punishment</p>
<p>Owner's Wife Cries Madly</p>
<p>Lei Sheng-sheng, a 57-year-old man from Suzhou, had some savings and opened three porcelain shops in the City God Temple inside the Little East Gate. One was named Lei Ren Ji, and another Ren Chang. Lei Ren Ji, located near the old site of Osmanthus Hall, hired an apprentice named Xu De-xiang from Zhenjiang, who was 21 years old and earned nine yuan a month. However, he was rude and often resorted to violence, acting like a hooligan. Lei Sheng-sheng repeatedly reprimanded him but to no avail, and fearing trouble, continued to employ him. It is known that yesterday morning at 8:30, Lei Sheng-sheng went to the shop from his home at No. 2 Hongfu Lane, Fangbang Road, as usual, and Xu De-xiang happened to enter from outside. When asked why he had gone out, he initially did not respond. Lei Sheng-sheng scolded him slightly, and Xu De-xiang dared to roar and jump, directly attacking Lei Sheng-sheng. Lei, being old and weak, was no match for him and immediately fell to the ground. Xu De-xiang forcefully struck Lei Sheng-sheng's head with his palm. The nerves in his head were excessively stimulated, and his complexion became pale, his breathing weak. The area struck was split open, and red blood flowed continuously. Seeing the situation was bad, Xu De-xiang took the opportunity to escape. He shouted loudly to the other shop assistants, opened his feet, and fled towards Yu Garden Road, not knowing where he was going. The injured Lei Sheng-sheng was unconscious and was carried back to Hongfu Lane by his family. Due to the severity of his injuries, he died at 11 a.m. They immediately reported to the police station and the local authorities, requesting an autopsy and the arrest of the murderer to avenge the wrong. It is said that Xu De-xiang's guarantor, a Mr. Xu, has also escaped and his whereabouts are unknown. Lei Sheng-sheng left behind three sons: Wei-xing, 17 years old; Gen-xing, 13 years old; and the youngest, A-san, 9 years old. He also had one daughter who was still in her swaddling clothes. His wife, upon seeing her husband's violent death yesterday, cried uncontrollably, as if she had gone mad. (Shanghai South Society)</p>
<p>In a Kidnapping and Extortion Case</p>

<p>The Remaining Criminals Imprisoned Separately Gu Ziqing and Others Declared Not Guilty</p>
<p>Previously, Chief Detective Xie Shuiquan, Detective Lu Jinshan, and Detective Bao Jin Guanya of the General Patrol Room arrested the criminals Yang Hua and Wang A'er. It was found that Yang and others had committed the crime of attempted kidnapping of Jiang Baozhen. They were handed over to the Special District Court for interrogation, and the hearing was concluded awaiting sentencing. This newspaper has already reported the details. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou Hanting took the seat in the First Criminal Court and announced the judgment. Yang Hua was sentenced to death for the crime of jointly committing extortion. Wang A'er was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment for the crime of assisting in extortion. Shen Caiyi was sentenced to five years imprisonment for the crime of possessing military firearms with the intention of using them for criminal purposes. The remaining defendants were found not guilty of extortion. Gu Ziqing, Qin Heshang, and Hua Jinrui were all found not guilty. The number of days that Wang A'er and Shen Caiyi were detained before the judgment was confirmed will be converted into imprisonment at the rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. One Mauser pistol, 31 bullets, two automatic pistols, and 16 bullets were all confiscated. Mr. Ru Baoyi, the lawyer for the patrol room, declared that he would not appeal the acquittal of the defendants. Mr. Shen Xingxia, the lawyer representing the defendant Hua Jinrui, requested that the acquittal be declared. The court granted the request and the defendants were released immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Director Weidebang Missing <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Went Missing on the "Dalian Maru" Ship Approaching Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the "Great American Evening Post", Mr. Weidebang, the managing director of Biefa Foreign Firm, went to the three northeastern provinces for sightseeing. He took the "Dalian Maru" back to Shanghai a few days ago. On Saturday (the 1st), when the ship was outside the mouth of the Yangtze River, seven hours away from Shanghai, he suddenly went missing. The truth of the matter remains unknown. Initially, it was suspected that he had committed suicide by jumping into the sea, but according to his friends and colleagues in the foreign firm, it was likely an accidental fall into the sea. Although Mr. Wei's health was not very good, he would not have committed suicide for this reason. Moreover, he was always optimistic and had not married, so he had no family worries or financial burdens. Therefore, it is not believed that he had a desire to renounce the world and jump into the sea. It is said that Mr. Wei's disappearance was first discovered by a Chinese gentleman in the same cabin. Mr. Wei got up very early, had breakfast, and then went for a walk on the deck. Later, the gentleman wanted to find Mr. Wei but could not find him anywhere. He reported it to the captain, who searched the entire ship but found no trace of him. After arriving in Shanghai, he reported it to the police station, who inspected his luggage but found no clues. In addition to 422 yuan in cash and a HSBC bank passbook, there were no important items in his suitcase. Mr. Wei was born in England and was 50 years old.</p>

<p>Rushing to Board the Ferry</p>
<h3 id="e186">Twenty to Thirty Female Workers Fall into the River <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Many Rescued</p>
<p>Quite a Few Drowned</p>
<p>The Xinfashun small steamship of Fuxing Company mainly tows barges and ships in the dock. When free, it picks up passengers at the Qichang pier in Pudong and the Weisaigong pier in Hudong. Each fare is four copper coins for male passengers and half for female passengers. The ship is very small and can only hold fifty or sixty people. At about 6 o'clock yesterday morning, it was picking up passengers at the Pudong pier. At that time, there were sixty or seventy female workers who worked in various cigarette factories in Hudong and lived in Pudong. Because the factory opened at 7 o'clock, they were eager to board the ferry to enter the factory. They rushed to board the ferry, ignoring the danger. However, the side of the ship could not withstand the pressure of so many people and tilted slightly inward. The female workers, who had not yet stood firmly, immediately fell into the river, about twenty to thirty of them. The sailors, seeing the disaster, rushed forward to rescue them, rescuing more than ten people on the spot. The Yaofuji dredging ship, which was parked there, also helped to rescue more than ten people. Those rescued were like drowned chickens, and the weather was very cold at that time. The wind blew, and everyone shivered and had no color. However, they had no clothes to change and could only run home to change. Those who were not rescued in time suffered a tragic drowning. Because people did not have time to pay attention to the number of people who fell into the water, the details could not be confirmed. When asked, nearby boatmen said that at least five or six people died. A hunched old woman, about fifty years old, suddenly ran to the pier where the accident occurred and cried loudly, looking at the river. She left in the evening. According to her, she had three daughters, the eldest was 22 years old, the second was 20 years old, and the youngest was 18 years old. The two youngest daughters were rescued and returned home. The eldest daughter was buried in the bottom of the river, etc. It was also said to be tragic. After the accident, Mr. Hu Yufu, the manager of the small steamship, reported the case to the water police station for the record. Chen Ashi, the foreman, was interrogated by the water patrol team to determine the situation and to judge the responsibility. At the same time, the water police station, upon hearing the news, also sent detectives Wang Haiquan and Hu Changqing to rush to the scene and detained the Xinfashun small steamship for investigation.</p>

<p>Since Police Chief Wu of the Capital Police Department took office, he has been actively working on public security matters. He has paid even more attention to firefighting, as the quality of fire administration is closely related to the people. He is seeking to improve it in order to make it complete. Therefore, he commissioned Section Chief Xie Guanyi of the Security Section to come to Shanghai with the members of the districts and bureaus of the capital to inspect the fire brigades in the Chinese districts and visit the concessions to see the police administration and various firefighting equipment. They were very detailed and praised the arrangements and all the measures as being comparable to those in the concessions. Therefore, he felt that only specialists could effectively manage fire administration. Chief Wu expressed great sympathy and immediately ordered Mr. Xie to write a letter to the South and West District Fire Brigades in Shanghai, proposing to hire Director Xia Guoliang to go to the capital to serve as the captain of the team and manage firefighting matters. And if he could not spare the time, he should recommend suitable talents and select two qualified squad leaders to act on his behalf. Director Xia, because he was busy with public and private affairs in Shanghai, could not accept the position and immediately recommended Mr. Wang Haici, a member of the local council, who was experienced and talented and could take on the position. For squad leaders, he recommended Mr. Zhu Zilian, a volunteer member of this district, and Mr. Yang Zhenmin, a clerk in the East District. Therefore, letters and telegrams were exchanged and a compromise was reached. Yesterday afternoon, a letter was received from Section Chief Xie, urging Mr. Wang Haici to go to the capital as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Pirates Land and Occupy Civilian Houses</p>
<p>Water and Land Police Corps Sent to Suppress</p>
<p>Recently, a large group of pirates suddenly sailed three or more pirate ships to the waters outside Wusongkou, such as Fengli Juegang. They surrounded four large and small fishing boats fishing in the waters, looted them successfully, and then set the ships on fire. Most of the crew members fell into the water and died. The pirates then landed at Beixingqiao Port and carried out large-scale looting. The residents of the area knew that they would be harmed if the pirates landed, so they abandoned their homes in haste and fled elsewhere, and sent people to report to the Juegang water and land police team. It is now known that the pirates have occupied civilian houses since landing and have not left yet. Juegang is very close and the situation is extremely urgent.

<p>Searches the Store Owner's Person But Finds Nothing</p>
<p>Opens Fire with Handgun Fortunately No One is Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at about 6 o'clock, a blue-eyed man, whose nationality was unknown, suddenly came to the Ruì Tài Woolen Shop at No. 616 Nanjing Road while it was still open for business. Speaking in English, he rushed upstairs to search the store owner's person, but found nothing. He wanted to rummage through the boxes and cabinets, but the store assistants downstairs, seeing the situation, knew that he must be a thief and shouted loudly. An apprentice went out the back door to call for the police. The Western thief, seeing this, immediately took out a handgun from his sleeve and fired a shot, fortunately without injuring anyone. He then fled out the door. By the time the police arrived, the thief was nowhere to be found. Afterwards, the victim reported the incident to the police station, requesting an investigation.</p>

<p>Life in Danger</p>
<p>Shi A'gen, a 47-year-old man from Chongming, runs a stove shop at No. 979 Huayi Fang, North Sichuan Road. Yesterday afternoon at a little past one o'clock, two men wearing short coats suddenly came and asked Shi if there was anyone upstairs. Before A'gen could answer, one of them pulled out a sharp axe from his arms and struck A'gen's left temple, causing blood to flow profusely. The assailant then ran away wildly. Although Shi was seriously injured, he was very strong and could still track him. However, he collapsed on the ground after walking only a few steps. By the time the police arrived, the assailant had already disappeared. He was immediately sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that his life is in danger. Afterwards, according to Shi, his wife Yu, who is 39 years old, has three children, and although she is middle-aged, she is very flirtatious. The upstairs is rented to a Cantonese who runs a small general association and employs a tea server from Yangzhou named Ayou, who is about 20 years old, looks like Pan An, and is naturally frivolous. He often joked with his wife and has been reprimanded by me several times, so he has not spoken to me for many days. I was ambushed this time, perhaps at the instigation of Ayou.</p>

<p>Villagers Break Superstition The Public Does Not Reincarnate</p>
<p>A hemp sack was hanging on a big tree along the river west of the Catholic Church Street in Xujiahui, Shanghai West, yesterday morning. A villager passing by noticed that the sack was quite heavy and wanted to find out what it was, so he took the sack down and opened it. It was a strange child. The body and limbs were like a normal child, but the head was round, the face was round, the eyes were round and black, the teeth were all bent, and the ears, nose, and mouth were all like a wildcat. The villager thought that if he had a strange child at home, everyone would come to see it, so that he would not be reborn. Therefore, the child must have been abandoned here by a nearby family. A crowd gathered at once, all saying that it was a child with a cat face and a human body. In the evening, someone moved the strange child and buried it in the mud.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese Federation Cables</p>
<h3 id="e197">Qingdao Municipal Government to Arrest Dutch Traffickers <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>To Uphold the Law and Please the People</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation cabled the Qingdao Municipal Government yesterday:</p>
<p>Mayor Hu of Qingdao Municipal Government:</p>
<p>The Min Bao reported that Dutch teacher Shi Wenhua entrusted two girls to bring to Qingdao, one named Ailan and the other Yuxiang, both ten years old and from Suzhou, but were captured and detained by your Municipal Public Security Bureau pending collection. It is admirable to see that you have exposed traitors and suppressed them. The main criminal, the Dutch teacher, has committed the crime of trafficking. Has he also been arrested? If he is still at large, please order an investigation and arrest him. He is a barbarian who falsely pretends to be civilized under his banner. The Zhī bā dé Beast Ship under his banner had a bestial first and second mate who raped Ms. Xiao Xin'an in our country. In Qingdao in our territory, there is a pseudo-missionary who traffics our country's girls, hoping to sell them into slavery. If these crimes were committed by overseas Chinese living in the Dutch colony, what severe punishments would they receive? [ellipsis] It is even more difficult to escape the scene of the neighbor's clothing and escorting them out of the country. Is our country not a country? Are we not human beings? If we do not abandon or despise ourselves, we should punish one to warn a hundred, and treat the Dutch colony as the Dutch government treats our overseas Chinese in return, in order to achieve equality and promote justice. If overseas Chinese commit crimes, let the Dutch government punish them. If Dutch overseas Chinese commit crimes and the Dutch consulate protects them, we will treat them as a super-class country and treat ourselves as a non-class country. We will see the Zhava sailors defile all the women in our country, and the Dutch teachers abduct all the children in our country. If the people's hearts are dead, what is there to wait for? Your government protects human rights without fear of the strong and is willing to order your Municipal Public Security Bureau to quickly arrest the principal offender, the Dutch teacher, and send him to the competent authority for handling in order to maintain the law and please the people. We are extremely anxious.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Federation respectfully</p>

<h3 id="e198">Opposes Water Price Increase <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Asks Water Company to Amend Contract Signed with the Municipal Council</p>
<p>Various groups in this port, such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Taxpayers' Association, and the Real Estate Association, are all adamant in opposing the water price increase and are working together to achieve success. It is learned that the Western Owners Association of this port also unanimously opposes it. The chairman of the association declared that when the association discussed this matter last time, although he was not personally present, the Municipal Council, without considering the interests of the owners and water users, rashly approved the 25% price increase, which has become an undeniable fact. The most important reason for the price increase is to protect the official profits of the company's shareholders. After discussion, it was decided to send another letter to the water company for negotiations. The original letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(To whom it may concern: The directors of this association have continued to discuss the matter of water price increase. At the last meeting, it was resolved to send a letter to your company requesting to know whether Clause 10 of the contract signed between the Municipal Council and your company on March 17, 1928, can be amended based on the 27th amendment, or whether it should be amended by arbitration. Please reply, etc.</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Training Association Is Ordered to Inform</p>
<p>The Public Training Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued a circular to the people's organizations in this city yesterday, stating that the Central Executive Committee issued instruction No. 16746, stating that investigating and starting training the people in the use of the four powers is the party's most important task today. The prerequisite for using the four powers is to make the people familiar with the use of people's rights initiatives. All organs, schools, and groups should first be familiar with people's rights initiatives in order to set an example for the people to use the four powers. Recently, it has been found that many groups affiliated with the party hold various gatherings, and many of them can follow people's rights initiatives, but there are also some who are not familiar with the order and are disordered, which not only wastes time and reduces effectiveness, but also indirectly hinders the completion of the training period. For this reason, in addition to informing the National Government to order its subordinates to implement it, this order specially orders the association to comply and order its affiliated groups to implement people's rights initiatives when holding gatherings in order to train and achieve practical results. This is very important.</p>

<p>Lianhe Steamboat's Carelessness</p>
<p>The Changjiang steamboat Lianhe of Yihua Foreign Company was returning to Shanghai from Mo Xia this time. When the boat was about to arrive in Nanjing, the wires in its fire cabin suddenly short-circuited, and a raging fire broke out. The fire spread to the cargo hold. The shipowner learned about it and immediately stopped the boat and ordered all the crew and sailors to put out the fire with all their might. Only then did the fire extinguish, but the goods in the cabin, except for those burned on the surface, were all water-stained. They were now unloaded at the Shuntai wharf, and public appraisers will be sent today to inspect the loss and notify the customers to pay the water fee. As for the ship, it has been slightly damaged and has been sent for repair. The passengers and crew were not harmed.</p>
<p>Hongyuan Barge Fire</p>
<p>The Changjiang steamboat Hongyuan of Sanbei Company was dragging two barges loaded with 15,100 yards of Texaco kerosene from Shanghai to Hankou this time. When loading at the dock, the kerosene loaded in one of the barges was suddenly ignited by a cigarette butt, and the oil was flammable, so it spread rapidly. Fortunately, the dock was full, so it was easier to put out the fire. As a result, more than 200 boxes were burned, but the ship was not seriously damaged. The cargo owner and the insurance company were immediately notified for inspection.</p>

(3) The pay increase starting from November 1 should be changed to a pay increase starting from September 1. (4) The clause "No further pay increases will be made" should be completely removed. It is determined that a letter will be sent to Taikoo Company today (the 4th) to reply.</p>

<p>Qingdao Railway Cancels Half-Price Freight</p>
<p>Yesterday, the China National Coal Production and Sales Association received a letter from Qingdao coal merchants stating (excerpt omitted): Since the Railway Bureau, under the pretext of relieving the coal shortage in Qingdao, cancelled the half-price export freight, more than a month has passed without restoration. As a result, except for small batches loaded for export by Japanese merchants, no Chinese coal merchant has loaded a single ton. The Railway Bureau declared that it cancelled the half-price to restrict external transport in order to relieve the coal shortage. However, it is not known that this year's export volume is more than half less than in previous years. The reason is that since this spring, either there has been a lack of wagons, or military events have occurred, disrupting transportation. The coal shortage in Qingdao was entirely caused by the interruption of the railway. Now that the coal shortage has become a thing of the past, the coal reserves in various inland stations and Qingdao are very sufficient, so the coal price is falling daily. If the half-price is not restored to allow exports, the coal mines in Zibo and Zhangqiu counties will inevitably have to close completely. The Railway Bureau still stubbornly refuses to restore it, and its ulterior motives are conceivable. Its destruction and oppression of coal merchants are deeply resented. Now, the Chinese authorities advocate industry and protect domestic goods, fearing it is already too late. How can they continue to destroy? This is a brief account, please urge the conference to find a way out for coal merchants (rest omitted).</p>

<h3 id="e218">Arriving in Jinan <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Moye</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence</p>
<p>For two days after arriving in Jinan, the weather has been continuously rainy and depressing. There is no military news to report. As for the suffering of the people, due to the lack of statistical materials, it is difficult to obtain concrete content. I would like to talk about several important issues in Shandong Province.</p>
<p>1.  Banditry: Banditry in Shandong Province did not begin today, but it is especially rampant after the war. The most famous areas are Jiaodong and western and southwestern Shandong. These bandits appear and disappear unpredictably, and they have been formally recognized and used by each other, so their equipment is also very sufficient. The official soldiers' capabilities are not worth mentioning, and the responsibility of suppressing them is not easy. Sometimes, they act as local militias and sometimes win the hearts of the people to resist the government troops, so a fundamental solution is impossible. For example, the troops under Xue Chuanfeng in the southwestern Yangu area have been formally appointed by the Jin side as the commander of the Special Operations Brigade. He is a native of southwestern Shandong and is very familiar with the local situation. In fact, it is very difficult for government troops to open up the area. It is quite difficult to eradicate them due to the lack of troops, and the mobilization of guest troops is also quite difficult. For example, although Liu Zhennian's troops in Jiaodong only have 30,000 soldiers, their combat effectiveness is very high after Liu's strict training. However, it is virtually impossible to obtain Liu's full responsibility for suppressing banditry. As a result, Han's troops suddenly go east and suddenly go west, and the banditry is never defeated. As a result, although Shandong Province has been pacified, banditry is no less weak than military disasters. As for the losses suffered by the people due to banditry, the official authorities have not investigated or assumed responsibility. However, the provincial government must receive reports of bandit alerts every day, which is a fact.</p>
<p>2.  Finance: According to the new budget for Shandong Province in the 19th year, the total annual revenue is 28,887,057 yuan, and the expenditure, according to the published figures, is also the same amount. However, the land tax item in the revenue is 14,847,209 yuan, which is the amount determined previously. Now, this land tax has long been pre-collected by the previous warlords. If the provincial government still needs to maintain this amount, it must emulate the previous successor's preparation. I would like to ask if the people, in the state of being covered in wounds and eyes, have the ability to bear this burden. Moreover, if the various regular and miscellaneous taxes and levies total no less than 2.6 million yuan per year, these taxes and levies mostly involve harsh details. If wise governance begins, the number of annual expenditures maintained in its original state is bound to lose half of its numbers. At present, the area of ​​Shandong Province can actually be divided into three parts: one is the area under Han Fuqu's command in Jinan and central and northern Shandong, one is the area under Liu Zhennian's command in Jiaodong, and one is the area under Ma Hongkui's command in southern Shandong. The systems of these parts of the army are not related to each other, and all administrative matters are managed separately. The tax collection agencies do not need to be mentioned, so the total amount of income mentioned above still needs to be reduced by two parts. It is obvious that the income is not enough to cover the expenditure, and there is no way to deal with the financial situation. The plan to rectify the provincial government has become a pie in the sky.</p>
<p>3.  Aggression: Shandong Province has suffered no less oppression from the Japanese than the two provinces of Jilin and Liaoning, and the most fearful thing is economic aggression. The arrangements in Qingdao are indisputable. In Jinan, the crisis and heartbreaking places are even more numerous. Here are two examples: one is poison. Since Han Fuqu took office as chairman of Shandong Province, he has been strictly enforcing the ban on smoking. It is said that anyone who violates the ban will be shot upon discovery. A 13-year-old child who was found with opium paste was subjected to extreme punishment. It can be seen that the authorities are determined to ban drugs, but the authorities can only prohibit Chinese people from trafficking and smoking privately, but cannot stop the Japanese from selling them. As a result, those who are prohibited from selling privately are only increasing the Japanese's private pockets, and the victims of the Chinese have become even more serious. The second is that according to investigations by Japanese pawnshops, there are more than 50 Japanese-run pawnshops in Shandong Province, taking Jinan as an example. The reason for their development is that, passively, the Chinese government cannot protect Chinese pawnshops and allows soldiers to harass them, which ultimately leads to their closure, leaving the Japanese to rise up and take their place. Actively, the Japanese operate this industry without relying on our country's laws and doing whatever they want. The profits are generous and there is no competition from Chinese people, so their business is booming, and the people of the five countries are subjected to the most vicious exploitation. The usual practice of Japanese pawnshops is that the interest rate is 10%, and they cannot be redeemed after three months, and the pawn price is extremely low, often less than one-tenth of the original price. For example, those who pawn at the end of the month will be charged for two months by Japanese merchants on the first day of the following month, even though it is clearly a two-day period. All disputes are noted on the pawn ticket in accordance with Japanese law, so in the event of litigation, the fault always lies with the pawner. The villagers can only endure the pain of pawning with cash, which is no different from drinking poison to quench their thirst. What has been said above is still a very small matter. If the government can pay attention to the suffering of the people, it is still not impossible to recover. The most fearful thing is that the Japanese have concrete and large-scale economic aggression plans. The details cannot be accommodated in this article and will be reported in another article after investigation.</p>
<p>4.  Party Affairs: The party affairs in Shandong Province are completely isolated from the people. The situation is no different from that in the provinces of Pingjin and Hebei, and its intervention in local judicial administration is excessive. We do not need to specify when this phenomenon began, but it is a fact that Shandong Province has had this weakness in the past. According to reports, there are only three to four thousand registered and qualified party members in Shandong Province, which is less than one-thousandth of the total population of the province. Although the residents are simple and robust, they can still obey orders. If the senior party leaders are well-led, party affairs in Shandong Province are easiest to carry out and will also be a major aid to the party. Unfortunately, those who have handled party affairs in the past have always regarded themselves as another class, and their arrogance has been overwhelming, and their private morals have often not been self-examined, resulting in the loss of the people's faith. The political enemies of the central government often use this to attack Jiang himself or the entire government, but in reality, they are all caused by the party's bad image. Although the current rectification committee has an insufficient number of people, the person in charge still knows to first send inspectors to various places to conduct a thorough investigation of the status of party affairs in preparation for future rectification. The reporter hopes to establish a solid connection with the people in the midst of changing the course and seeking change. The above is only a summary of the four major aspects. Other measures such as the urgent need to rectify river affairs, the effective elimination of miscellaneous troops, the reduction of military quotas, the abolition of miscellaneous taxes and levies, and the cessation of pre-collection of land taxes are all essential measures to save Shandong. The authorities should reflect on this, and the people of Shandong should rise up and urge the government to implement them.</p>

<p>The Odeon Company announced that among the sound films produced by the American First National Film Company this year, there are two sister films: Paris and Lillies of the Field. These two films are not only great productions of the First National Film Company, but also the most honorable works on the American silver screen this year. Paris is the crystallization of the French famous singer and dancer Irene Bordoni's first appearance on the screen. Lillies of the Field is the last masterpiece of the orchid girl Colleen Moore. Ms. Irene is famous for her singing and dancing and is one of the three famous singers and dancers in the world. Some film companies in the United States admired her and offered her a large sum of money to star in the film. At that time, sound films had not yet been invented, but Ms. Irene declined, believing that although the art of dance could be enhanced by film, the beauty of song could not be expressed by silver light. After sound films were invented, the First National Film Company sincerely invited her to star in Paris. The film was shown in a large theater in New York. At the same time, Paramount Company's The Godless Girl was also released. As a result, the audience sighed that it was impossible to have both bear's paw and fish. As a result, both films sold out every day, and the ticket price increased from 2 US dollars to 6 US dollars. It was necessary to purchase them two weeks in advance to get a seat. It can be imagined that they were a sensation at the time and were welcomed by the audience. The Godless Girl has been shown in Shanghai several times, while Paris only arrived in Shanghai last week. It is now scheduled to be shown at the most luxurious and magnificent new Cathay Theater in Shanghai, which is about to open. As for its sister film Lillies of the Field, it has not yet arrived in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Ford Company announces that at the recent International Automobile Competition held by the Polish Automobile Association, Ford cars won the first and third prizes, which is sufficient to prove that the capability of Ford cars is that they can travel at the highest speed on the most rugged roads. The entire race covered approximately 2,000 miles, starting from Warsaw and passing through major cities throughout Poland, such as Radom, Kielce, Czestochowa, Poznan, Inowroclaw, Gniezno, Bydgoszcz, Torun, and Vilnius, before following the Russian border directly to Limburg and then racing back to Warsaw. The time taken was six days, with stops in major Polish cities. The first prize was a standard Ford tourer, which was purchased from the Ford dealership three days before the race. The awards received totaled as many as fifteen, the most important of which was the Gold Victory Cup given by the Polish Automobile Association. Other awards were given for the car's speed, durability, and performance on mountain roads. Another Ford tourer won the third prize.</p>

<h3 id="e224">The Story of the Vest <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Juan</p>
<p>The fallen leaves of the plane trees flutter and fall onto the grass. A dozen or so benches stand quietly, waiting for their masters to arrive.</p>
<p>After the four o'clock dismissal bell, the female students rush into the campus, each holding various kinds of yarn and vests and clothes that they have just started working on or that are already half-finished.</p>
<p>They find their seats and sit down one after another. Those who can't get a bench squeeze in with others, sometimes three people sharing one bench. The clamor and laughter begin.</p>
<p>("Your vest is really nice. The bean paste color matches the trim. Oh, the buttons are sewn on too, also bean paste color. No wonder I couldn't find you after school yesterday. You were matching buttons. Mr. A is really lucky!") Before Ping finishes speaking, someone pinches her leg. She cries out softly ("Ouch!").</p>
<p>A leaf falls on Ping's hair, and a green caterpillar crawls out from under the leaf. Wen, who is sitting next to her, screams. Everyone, not knowing why, leaves their seats to watch.</p>
<p>("What's so scary about this?") Ying, nicknamed "Wild Zhang Fei," reaches out to grab it and even shows off her skills by deliberately letting the worm crawl on her nose.</p>
<p>Wen has already jumped into the middle of the ground and hides her face in her hands.</p>
<p>Those students who were "squatting by the edge of the benches" take the opportunity to occupy other people's spots.</p>
<p>By the time they finish dealing with the "worm case" and return to their original positions, they see those who replaced them smiling proudly.</p>
<p>Seeing that this carousel-like game is too tiring, they propose sitting on the ground. Suddenly, handkerchiefs flutter like butterflies, and a dozen people sit in a circle and start singing.</p>
<p>The singing and the small, crisp sound of knitting needles combine to create a wonderful music. The environment of V University is originally quiet, and the campus is far from the sports field. At this time, all is silent, and the singing reaches the autumn sky. The clear white clouds also crane their necks to listen quietly. The plane trees sway their branches, making a rustling sound that echoes the people's singing.</p>
<p>("You're really having fun!") A dozen or so mouths on the chairs say at the same time, inviting them to join the circle. Their group immediately gets larger and becomes oval-shaped.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Black Vest – New Autumn Outfit <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Bing She</p>
<p>The singing stops for a moment, and the vest debate is declared revived.</p>
<p>("Life is important! People aren't waiting to wear it, so don't rush like this. Take a break before continuing.")</p>
<p>("What do you mean, people aren't waiting? It's for my mother.")</p>
<p>("Haha, the old lady is wearing a green western vest! This is Miss Qin's new fashion invention. Come quickly, everyone, and take a look!") Wild Zhang Fei sings loudly in the style of a shop clerk calling for customers.</p>
<p>Qin's face turns red, and she lowers her head in silence.</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to hit her? This big guy is getting more and more naughty," Qin's neighbor encourages.</p>
<p>Thin-faced Qin and Wild Zhang Fei wrestle into a ball. With a clatter, a knitting needle breaks, and people from both sides come out to pull them apart. The power struggle turns into a verbal battle. Those who joined the battle group want to show off their eloquence and temporarily put down the work in their hands.</p>
<p>("Does knitting a vest necessarily mean it's for a lover? Can't people have older brothers and younger brothers at home who can wear vests?")</p>
<p>("Of course, older brothers and younger brothers can wear them, but this vest will tell me that it's for someone special. I can't lie for the vest.")</p>
<p>("Don't argue. There will be evidence when it's worn.")</p>
<p>("That's right!") A few people agree.</p>
<p>Most people lower their heads and awkwardly pull at the grass.</p>
<p>The red hibiscus flowers by the wall pile up like clouds, which is truly beautiful. The setting sun shines faintly on the branches of the deciduous trees, as if saying good night to people, indicating that it is about to return. Small birds chirp, and a gust of west wind swirls the fallen leaves in the air. The innocent laughter of the girls adds some joy to this twilight hour.</p>
<p>("There's a French test tomorrow! I don't know if you've been reviewing. You've been too busy making trouble. What are you going to do?") The voice of someone resembling a teacher startles everyone. Looking closely, Wild Zhang Fei stands straight, making everyone else bend over with laughter.</p>
<p>("Don't pay attention to her. French is just old T's thing anyway. It doesn't matter.")</p>
<p>("But we should still go look at the books.") Ping, sitting under the tree, says this and stands up at the same time, brushing off the dirt. She grumbles, "I only finished one inch today. It's getting cold. When will I ever finish this? It's so annoying being with you little sparrows." She pretends to be angry.</p>
<p>("You were the one who led the trouble just now, and now you're complaining about others. You're really shameless.")</p>
<p>They both laugh. The circular formation has already dispersed. Everyone stands up one after another. Those who are anxious about tomorrow's exam leave first. The most mischievous ones make trouble for a while longer before slowly walking with gliding steps toward the self-study room.</p>
<p>The air on campus suddenly becomes calm. Only these mute benches will forever keep the secret of their conversation.</p>

<p>(20) At the Chinese Eastern Railway Club</p>
<p>Early in the morning, Ou and Miss Zhu came to find me. I was still asleep. I groggily got up, thinking that they must be going somewhere to play again. However, Ou is about to take his graduation exam, so it doesn't seem like he'll have time to play.</p>
<p>("Oh, you're not up yet? Hurry, hurry... get up, get up! Miss Zhu is waiting outside. Her skin will suffer in the sun.")</p>
<p>("Okay, I'll be quick. Please invite Miss Zhu inside.")</p>
<p>("No, just hurry up and wash, and come out immediately.")</p>
<p>I forgot to ask him what was going on and hurriedly threw on my clothes. I didn't even tie my tie before Ou pulled me out.</p>
<p>("This is Miss Zhu. This is Mister Su—Su, come, come, let's go to the coffee shop in front to have an ice before we go.")</p>
<p>("What's going on? Why are you so busy? Aren't you supposed to be taking the exam?")</p>
<p>("The exam? It's really funny. Miss Zhu and I went to Professor X's house early this morning to take it because we had a makeup exam today.")</p>
<p>We sat at a table in the coffee shop and ordered three ices, which stopped Ou's and Miss Zhu's sweating.</p>
<p>("After we eat, let's go find Ningqiu to ask him for tickets to the Fada Drama. I originally thought that Old Xie would have them, but he didn't. I think Ningqiu will definitely have them. Do you know where he lives?")</p>
<p>("He's still with Changhong.")</p>
<p>We finished our ices and then took the streetcar to find Ningqiu.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Ningqiu had already gone to Fada, leaving Changhong alone in the room smoking. We had no choice but to split up.</p>
<p>……………</p>
<p>In the evening, Ou came again.</p>
<p>("I got the tickets. Let's go. It's at the Chinese Eastern Railway Club. I don't think you've been there before. You should go. There's a large theater inside, and there are also many books.")</p>
<p>This play was originally for disaster relief. It's really inappropriate for us to go see it for free. However, we poor people really can't do anything about disaster relief.</p>
<p>("We're only going to see the play directed by Ningqiu.")</p>
<p>("What play is Ningqiu directing?")</p>
<p>("Father Returns. Ningqiu told me yesterday that it's going well.")</p>
<p>………………………</p>
<p>We arrived at the Chinese Eastern Railway Club. The building of this club is naturally the only one in Harbin. The walls of the theater are decorated with delicate bas-reliefs. There is a delicate lamp in the center of the theater, and everything on the stage is very complete, with very realistic sets, and the lighting changes are also well-equipped.</p>
<p>The curtain opened. At first, these plays were really bad. Sometimes, you would see many performances that made you nauseous. Then Ou led me to the living room to look at books.</p>
<p>There were several reproductions of famous paintings. The technique was very skillful. One of the larger ones was a painting of a Cossack story. Several other landscapes seemed to be copied from the works of an English painter. The painting method was very detailed, but under the light and hung too high, I couldn't see them closely.</p>
<p>We rested on the sofa for a while and then went back to our seats. Then "Father Returns" started.</p>
<p>Before the performance, someone informed the audience of some viewing rules, because in the previous few plays, the audience was chaotically clamoring. This made the audience feel that "Father Returns" might be a very serious play, so after the curtain opened, the audience was silent.</p>
<p>Ningqiu didn't use the original realistic sets in the theater. He only used a few pieces of black cloth to simply line the back. Because of the lighting, it didn't seem inappropriate.</p>
<p>The spirit of the whole play lies in your own appearance on stage. When you, the wandering father, said ("When people get old, they think of home... Alas, I always want to earn a thousand or two thousand yuan to bring home... But fate is teasing me, and even the little house in the circus is burned down"),</p>
<p>and when Xian Yilang angrily shouted at his father ("Father, I've never had a father like you who loved me. I created everything myself... You suddenly broke into someone else's house and want people to call you father..."), some of the audience were actually shedding tears. After the play was over, Ou sighed and said to me:</p>
<p>("I'm afraid Ningqiu himself will become like this father in the future.")</p>
<p>But I myself am terrified that I might become this father.</p>

<p>— Guangmei</p>
<p>Although college students have reached the stage where they should be autonomous, there are many ways in which they are no more advanced than elementary school students. Elementary school students like it when the teacher takes a day off and the school is closed. College students are no different. It seems that I still remember when I was studying in a private school as a child, I often dreamed that the teacher wouldn't come for three out of five days. I simply hoped that our school would face west. Whenever I saw the sun about to cross the stone steps of the study room, we would spontaneously discuss with each other ("The teacher may not come today. The sun is about to reach the doorstep. I didn't see the teacher mention it yesterday either.") ("Maybe he's sick.") ("That's right. I don't want the teacher to die, I don't want the teacher to be dead, I just want the teacher to be sleeping in bed.") Under these circumstances, although we spoke energetically, our hearts were pounding with anxiety, fearing that the teacher would suddenly come in. It was really very childish at that time. We were all young children under the age of ten, so whenever we really had a holiday or the teacher announced ("I won't be here tomorrow."), especially when the teacher didn't give advance notice and didn't come midway, this feeling was the most intense. It was as if birds in a cage had been released and scattered with a bang. Also, every time it was near the Dragon Boat Festival or the Mid-Autumn Festival, and even more so for the New Year, we would spend at least half a month counting down the days. After the holidays were over, we would worry about having to go back to school. At this time, my grandfather and</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>My uncles and fathers would often tease people by saying ("Hey, you have to put on the bridle again. Hurry up and study hard, or you'll get beaten by the teacher.") This scene is as if it happened yesterday. However, looking back, how can one bear it? Alas, where has my childhood innocence disappeared to? Now, I am a college student and should no longer be like before, only willing to study under the strict authority of the teacher. However, bad habits are hard to break. After all, I still like it when the school is closed. There is no way around it.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the school's anniversary. In the morning, we only held a very simple ceremony. In the afternoon, we planned how to spend this holiday. First, Zhen and Xia proposed ("Let's go to Ye Garden in Jiangwan.") ("Second..."). ("I agree..."). So all five of us in the room agreed. We had been coveting Ye Garden for a long time, and now we finally had such an opportunity. While Yu went to get tickets for us, everyone brushed their shoes, slicked their hair, and lightly applied a layer of makeup, except for Xia. ("Everyone, don't wear high-heeled shoes. Wait a minute, you'll suffer and regret it.") ("Who's trying to look good like that? It's not like we're going out as guests.") ("Really, who are you dressing up for?") Everyone took care of each other, saying one thing or another. Although I didn't pay attention, I had it in mind. So I took a piece of white paper, wrapped my white cloth sneakers, and lightly tucked them under my arm in case I needed them.</p>
<p>("How quiet and secluded this is. It's simply a paradise on earth.") As soon as we entered the garden, everyone said these two general sentences in unison. Fortunately, Zhen had been here before, so we chose her as our guide. Wherever we went, we lingered, reluctant to leave. Seeing the clever artificial rocks and the places where we could take photos, I was always extremely annoyed that I hadn't asked someone to come with us to take pictures. However, in a helpless moment, I would comfort myself by saying ("Alas, who could have known there would be such wonderful scenery?")</p>
<p>The garden's novel layout, unique construction, and well-equipped facilities, especially the cleverness of the artificial rocks, are beyond my clumsy pen to describe fully. To tell the truth, foolish me, although I wandered for a long time, still couldn't get a bird's-eye view of it. Ye also said to me ("It's really impossible to write a travelogue. It's too good, the scope is too wide, and every place and every scene is good. How can you bear to part with any of it? Oh, it's too beautiful to take in and too much to remember.")</p>
<p>The garden's special feature is that it seems to be built in the mountains. The elevations rise and fall, no different from Loxia Mountain. The construction of the artificial rocks, with winding paths leading to secluded places, with small holes to enter and exit, is similar to the Twelve Caves of Yan Mountain ("The mountain has a small mouth, as if there is light..."), which coincides unexpectedly. When encountering such a situation, Xia and I always argue about who gets to say ("I want to be a gardener here.") ("After I turn forty and have fulfilled my responsibilities to the country and society, I will definitely come here and discuss with the garden owner about letting me be a gardener here.") We even want to turn into a fish, a bird, even a fly is happy. Although this is inevitably too much like sitting in a well and looking at the sky, being in this sea of ten feet of soft red all the time, it's no wonder we have this kind of greed.</p>
<p>In the depths of a bamboo forest is surrounded a Chinese-style house carved full of gold patterns. The terrain of the house is very low, but it is cleverly recessed in the bamboo forest, so we search for the entrance to the house.</p>
<p>We ascend to that secluded place in the bamboo forest, reluctant to leave it. At the same time, everyone cries out unexpectedly ("Oh, why don't I feel happy in my heart? Instead, I feel sad and just want to cry, but I can't cry for any particular reason. What's the matter? Could it be that happiness to the extreme will make you want to cry?") It's really too difficult to make people feel bad. Whenever we encounter better scenery, we initially shout like crazy, but immediately the feeling in our hearts turns into a sour taste. This kind of sourness caused by happiness is definitely different from what the romantics call melancholy. We simply don't know whether to laugh or cry, and an unknown mixed reaction rises in our hearts. Our mouths also express the same contradictory feelings ("Oh, how poetic, but I just want to cry.") ("Isn't that right? Who doesn't want to cry?") Everyone has this common psychology.</p>
<p>Although the scenery is good, it's not a place to stay for long. We reluctantly harden our hearts and say goodbye to Ye Garden. I'm afraid that even when parting with a lover, we wouldn't be so reluctant as we are now.</p>
<p>It was still early, about half past three. There were no cars when we left, so we walked to the racecourse. Xia proposed that we continue to Wusong. I seconded the proposal, followed by Ye, Cheng, and Zhen. The two of them cried that they were dizzy and their feet hurt, so they took a bus back to school. Xia, Ye, and I took a car to Jiangwan and then took a train. Then I went to Tongji to call Mao. The two of them went to Zhonggong first to look for Old Xuejin and Ms. Meng, and agreed to meet at Zhonggong half an hour later to go to Paotai Bay. Fortunately, we all met, but Miss Jin was uncomfortable and went back to Shanghai, which was regrettable.</p>
<p>Oh, the students nearby are really comfortable. After class and after dinner, they can come to the riverside to stroll at any time. On a moonlit night like today, there is an unspeakable joy, mystery, and taste. It is truly a place for uncivilized people. In the summer evenings, it's nice to come and cool off, and if you're happy, you can play musical instruments such as the flute, clarinet, and violin. It's so great that it's indescribable. It has the atmosphere of a poet's life. At the same time, the rushing waters of the Huangpu River can very much arouse people's upward will, broaden their minds, and even evoke people's revolutionary emotions, bravery, and action. It can also break down the concept of individualism. In that great natural realm, you can feel that the individual is particularly small.</p>
<p>The moon goddess accompanied us so enthusiastically that we were happy and forgot to return.</p>
<p>We were honored by Meng and the others' warm hospitality. They insisted on inviting us to a late dinner. We couldn't refuse their kindness. However, we never expected Meng to be so polite. Even now, when I think about it, I still feel uneasy. We also made noise for a long time, preventing them from studying. I feel even more sorry.</p>
<p>The train seemed to be deliberately making things difficult for us. We waited for a full quarter of an hour. By the time we got to Tiantong'an, it was already half past ten. At this time, the quiet Jiangwan Road was only occupied by the three of us, who were happy to say a witty remark ("Jiangwan Road is for the three of us.") The moonlight shone on the asphalt road, shining brightly. Clearly, the moon goddess was welcoming and protecting us.</p>
