<p>時評</p>
<h3>新國防與新財政</h3>
<p>今日各國有兩種新計劃急待討論者一爲新國防計劃視國際間外交情勢以成立者也一爲新財政計劃視國内外經濟狀况以成立者也以今日國際間外交情勢言减軍會議之結果旣等於零則爲新國防計者當然取充實與擴張主義以今日國内外經濟狀况言工商衰落潮流旣成普徧現象則爲新財政計者當然取節縮與重税政策故此兩種新計劃均可意想而得者也然而有一衝突之點在焉欲充實國防與擴張國防勢不得不增加軍費縱不增加亦必維持其原有之數但爲財政計則無此能力於是此國防新計劃乃感困難矣欲節縮財政勢不能不削减軍費削减軍費則有礙於國防大計欲加稅以補之又爲人民所不許於是此財政新計劃乃感困難矣有此困難之一點若軍事與財政兩當局各欲逕行其已意各欲如其所心願則議會與政府間勢必意見叢生糾紛以起此亦無可逃避者也</p>
<p>今日本之兩種新計劃正在無法解决德國新財長之財政新計劃雖已較前財長之計劃爲稍通融然究能通過與否尚未可知意相雖毅然下令增稅以備擴張新國防之用然究竟有無反響亦未可料總之此兩問題爲今日各政府所不能逃避之問题而其命運亦即繫焉者也</p>

<p>夫人丨這辦不到因爲我的丈夫夜夜在睡夢中總要説許多話把他日間所做的事完全説出來我的右耳恰恰有些重聽一句話也聽不出</p>

<p>乙丨不是只爲他的雪茄模樣兒很好而烟味是惡劣不堪所以擺擺架子就算了</p>
<p>甲丨我那住宅太舊了預備翻造一下</p>

<p>却説當全亞步行團未出發之前二日滬上各團體如商務印書館·申報館·時報館·友聲旅行團·和新近産生的東方圖書出版社等於本月二十六日午刻開歡宴會於滬西赫德路南園是日上午十一時余偕中國圖畫雜誌攝影輯部錫麒先生乘電車前去遍覓發起人黄警頑君不得便同郭先生到園中散步一週緑蔭遍地凉風習習暑氣盡消移時偕來賓二三到中式雄壯的建築物樓上佛敎總會太虛法師禪房清談片刻觀其四壁佈置佛氣盎然令人不禁生清靜無爲觀念忽而黄先生興致勃勃排闥直入怱怱導我們到佛敎會寳殿上舉目看時各團員一律</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<p>果夫小説集　　　秉慧</p>
<p>現代書局出版</p>
<p>諷剌的作品在中國文壇上本不多見有之亦大半是散文隨筆之類的東西來撑持塲面至於小説屬於這方面的那眞難數出幾本現在以這本［果夫小説集］看來到是一本頗含剌戟性的諷剌小説</p>
<p>寫諷剌小説本來是不很容易的事作者首先須要有鋭敏的目光能把一些不調和或不合理的事觀察出來然後還得要合乎小説的條件以這些事情詼諧地表現在作品上而使讀者能了解出諷剌的對象這才算逹到諷剌小説最後的目的而不失其效能在本書裹我覺得作者便具有這種本領能使讀者感着一種悲哀而痛快的滋味</p>
<p>本書共包含小説十二篇除[戰爭利器之大發明][理想中之小發明家]和[男子之乳]三篇序上曾説明原爲兒童讀物外其他九篇所冩的都是舊中國古老社會裹的點暗方面作者是以諷剌的筆調猛力向那行將死去的封建勞力與傳統思想進攻在他的筆下顯出了形形色色的灰色的人們的醜態</p>
<p>最明顯的我們在[大家庭中的故事]裹便可以看出十幾樣的人來他告訴我們在這老大的家庭中有在某大學理科畢業而做了一任縣知事便自命清高非有人來請他不再出云去的三叔叔有留起辫子穿起袍掛處處復古的七老仰爺有外國哲學博士帶回國的[新][舊]哲學有愛財寗可不要命的五哥哥有克勤克儉的做家而甘願爲兒孫作馬牛的三公公有互相玩弄的四叔叔和四嬸嬸有一把眼涙一把鼻滋見人便器的守寡的大伯母有遭兒子怨恨多生了弟兄的三哥哥有一房出了三個專門家的父親是赚錢的專門家兒子是用錢的專門家女兒是美學的專門家有一切疑問都委之於命運註定的靜軒叔有主僕結婚而爲人所不齒的正心哥有掛着慈善家的面具而大發其財的佛生哥有殺人不用力的自命儒醫的九叔叔有升官發財而自稱老革命黨的微生弟更有不把兒子讀書而聽算命瞎子的話靜候點翰林終谥致兒子墮落到自殺的父母總之像這些人醜惡的活動的人都是我們眼前常見慣的像這等事情也都是我們日常耳聞目睹的作者不僅是爲大家庭寫照實際上却是一幅社會人羣的縮影</p>
<p>因其作者是長於替舊中國的灰色的人生冩照所以在[善事]篇中寫的是一個老年紳士爲了想他兒子早一點替他養一個肥肥的孫子出來圖他們夫婦的老來歡喜於是决心加做善事辦了一座育婴堂不到幾個月工夫便斷送了八十幾估婴孫而社會上還認他是做善事的人在[可怕的暗殺]篇中的一個和大家庭中的故事裹的九叔叔一樣殺人不用刀的醫生而社會上却還認他是熱腸細心穩當慈愛種種美德被害者的父母還是感激他在這二篇中充分地懷疑到社會上一般人所謂的善惡標準換言之即就是對於社會的偶像的破壞使的會聯想起易卜生的[社會柱石]來</p>
<p>[不事生産的人]是寫一個老年人一生的大事業便是經營自已的墳墓他死的那天集了兒女們遺囑道[我的墳墓經營了多年爲我一生的大事業你們必須好好的保存····自我死的一天起用和尚道士拜七七四十九天的懺最好擇在蠶忙出殯儀仗要排得十里路長直到墳前必須演七天的好戲···]這足以代表一般年老人的心理[聰明人的生意]是寫一個爲了私利而不顧公衆衛生的所謂聰明人這種聰明人實在是最多不過最普遍的人[敎育之果]的主人公是一個外國農科畢業的留學生作者借一個老年人的口裹有一段絶妙的諷剌是</p>
<p>學問何必爲用像我的乾兒子那樣在外國學農回來難道眞做農夫不成你想他拿惯了棍子還可以拿鐵耙嗎他穿慣了皮鞋難道還可以赤脚耕田嗎像王小姐學師範他是千金小姐難道還願意坐冷板凳敎書過日子嗎老實的説他們有錢的人家的兒女不能不讀書兒女長大又不能不學一種東西放在肚裹免得给人家看上眼···我的大孫子也常向我吵着要出洋···你道他的用意在那裹他無非也要與我的乾兒子一樣寫寫英文情書回國討一個如王女士一樣的老婆</p>
<p>我們旣看見了舊人物的醜態但同時却也看到所謂新人物原也不過如此作者是用輕鬆微妙的筆調寫出來讀來是覺得異常爽快的可是馬上就會使你感着深過的悲哀</p>
<p>[返老還童]是理想的比較滑稽的作品他是側面地諷剌那貧富的苦樂相殊而使人會看出窮人是喪失了一切權利的另一個世界的人[添飯]在本書中是最幽默的一篇却也是最短有一篇在這短短的一篇裹他却把中國士大夫階級的人的思想生活充分地表現了出來從這篇看來我們可以斷定作者確有寫短篇小説的本领</p>
<p>現在我們且看這些灰色的人們所組成的社會是怎樣的作者在[行政]裹便把這種情形告訴了我們其實我們覺得不僅是湖州如此走遍了中國又何處不然</p>
<p>至於拉開褲子便在街頭巷尾小便張開口便隨灶吐痰那黄帝神裔數千年傳下來便是如此所謂小焉者不足爲奇况且笑駡任人笑骂好先生我自爲之本是大國民的大量反正不會介意的説説亦無非是枉然</p>
<p>我們且來看作者寫那些人的娱樂道湖州人娱樂的地方最好是茶館茶館裹茶客談起天來要比上海新世界的灘簧還滑稽（第四十三頁）</p>
<p>湖州有公共運動塲在圖書館的斜對面地是足夠用了也還算平坦不過運動員却難得看見（第四十三頁）</p>
<p>本來娱樂在我們中國人心理是一向不大被人注意的談起娱樂彷彿便是無聊消遣無非是茶樓酒館打牌嫖娼有些自命風雅的亦無非是琴棋書畫而已於是禮敎之邦斯文儒雅之士便越發萎靡不振了談起體育好像並不知道有這回事所以運動塲也就等於虛設眼望着世界上那充滿了强健的力活潑勇敢富於犧牲的精神的民族日飛猛進而自已只好消極地自詡精神文明了這是一種病態一種很重大的病態若這種思想不改變所謂的[消極]思想不改變那便足以爲我們民族的致命傷</p>
<p>作者認清了這點所以他便用一把解剖刀把我們民族的弱點細細地解剖了出來同時他還是一根針這根針是注滿了血清向我們民族的血管裹注射進去</p>
<p>魔鬼的舞蹈　　湯增敭</p>
<p>于廣虞著</p>
<p>具有美底素的散文在中國文藝範疇上比較算是有所收獲成爲一朶美麗而鮮艶的奇花異卉了因爲一篇散文的内容只須叙述作者所經過的零碎的斷想很槪括底把它寫了下來不必像小説一樣的虛構出許多空幻的記事所以它底體裁是屬於簡短精悍一類的文藝寫起來當然是比製作其它的文藝作品易於能夠得到較優的收獲這是必然的事實</p>
<p>不過這美的散文倘若用隨筆的手腕去寫便容易趨於枯燥乏味的境界不能逗引起讀者美底情緒緒猶如鑑賞一幅平凡的繪畫和歌咏一首無意義的詩篇一般因爲所謂美的散文是在乎其中藴蓄着詩意和畫意的如果過分的雕刻超越的描寫則又失支去固有的清韻永雋的情調散文中特具的深摰樸質的美了所以有人説寫散文這步工作最好由天才的詩人或畫家去做這話却有相當的情理而我們是不能否認的了</p>

<p>這裹面包括着二十篇簡短的美底散文首篇是[天使在流雲]末篇是[十字架]這所排的次序雖然我們不能夠夠曉得作者以什麽拿來作標準但在命題上可以推想到是含有象徵的意義的不過在表面上掁看來這種歸宿終不是值得世人企羨的歸宿在流雲中的使終久是被穩藴着國外宗敎意味的釘在[十字架]上這顯然不能代表中國民族底槪念實爲我要批判本書首先須提出的一大缺點　　詩底原質本來是用來調解人們在機械的矛盾的生活中所特具的不快的胸懷另外引起一種奇異的興味從纏綿的柔情裹獲得靈活的生力換一句話説便是在枯燥乏味的境界中突然遇到清秀山水的處所呼吸一下新鮮空氣被乏不振的體軀頃刻即能興奮起來宛如㨗足登上了另個新頴的世界清韻地和舊的魔窟隔絶了散文詩的效用無疑地也具有這樣啓發讀者情感的要素</p>

<p>這樣的詞句這樣的字眼在他每篇作品裹都能夠找尋得到差不多全靠着了疊砌和雕飾的工夫組織成一篇雕刻美的散文任它儘有清雋的名句和奢麗的詞藻任它儘有高超的格調和豪放的氣韻却終不曾表現過極豐富的想橡力自然的情調以及深摯樸質的美了使讀者感覺着異常的戰調</p>
<p>亘克以來詩人底性格完全屬於悲哀的一類所以有許多詩人在極樂的生活網裹也要矯揉造作的寫着感傷的詩句强制的喚發着悲哀情緒必然地于君這集子裹的散文充滿了頽廢的色彩做着詩人的悲哀的慘夢倘若不是爲了環境所迫那麽他這種歌咏是近乎無病呻吟的了</p>

<p>在這兩段文字裹便顯然可以看出作者眞個終日夜臥於［悲幻之境］獨自呻吟着胸懷中具有無限的悲哀有時還要希望人也要與他一樣的［沉淪］下去雖然他在本書裹也寫着幾許未來的企冀希望偉大的光明降臨再看他的丨</p>

<h3>New National Defense and New Finance</h3>
<p>Today, there are two new plans that countries urgently need to discuss: one is a new national defense plan formulated based on the international diplomatic situation, and the other is a new financial plan formulated based on the domestic and international economic conditions. Regarding the current international diplomatic situation, since the outcome of the disarmament conference is equivalent to zero, the new national defense plan will naturally adopt enrichment and expansionism. Regarding the current domestic and international economic conditions, since the trend of industrial and commercial decline has become a common phenomenon, the new financial plan will naturally adopt austerity and heavy taxation policies. Therefore, these two new plans are both conceivable. However, there is a point of conflict. If one wants to enrich and expand national defense, one inevitably has to increase military spending. Even if one does not increase it, one must maintain its original amount. But for the sake of finance, there is no such ability. Thus, this new national defense plan faces difficulties. If one wants to reduce finance, one cannot but cut military spending. Cutting military spending will hinder the grand plan of national defense. If one wants to increase taxes to compensate for it, the people will not allow it. Thus, this new financial plan faces difficulties. If the military and financial authorities each want to pursue their own intentions and wishes in the face of this difficulty, conflicts and disputes will inevitably arise between the parliament and the government. This is also unavoidable.</p>
<p>Japan's two new plans are currently irresolvable. Although the new financial plan of the new German Finance Minister is slightly more accommodating than the plan of the previous Finance Minister, it is still unknown whether it can be passed. The Italian Prime Minister has resolutely ordered tax increases to prepare for the expansion of new national defense, but it is also impossible to predict whether there will be any repercussions. In short, these two issues are questions that all governments cannot escape today, and their fate is tied to them.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<p>Luo Lin's troops blockaded Yangxin bandit gangs</p>
<p>The Peng-Li bandit gangs entrenched in the Ruichang area were defeated by the 18th Brigade's Wang Jiejun and fled to Yangxin, Hubei.

<p>Chu Xichun Hosts the Beijing Press</p>
<p>Recently, Chu Xichun and Wang Xifu hosted more than fifty reporters in Beijing, taking this opportunity to gather with the press. (1) They hoped that party affairs news would be more implicit, as the reorganization faction, Chen-Wang Western Hills faction, and Zou-Xie faction had different opinions, and party departments at all levels were also arguing a lot. In the end, they were all trustworthy to the country and would soon be able to understand each other. Before Wang Jingwei's arrival, all newspapers should be cautious in reporting on party affairs. (2) Communist Party news has been quiet since the summer vacation of various schools. They hoped that the press would not extensively report on crackdowns and discoveries, etc., as such reports would be used by them. (3) Military news should record facts and not over-promote, lest it lead to the folly of the beacon fires of Mount Li. The previous report of the occupation of Jinan was an example of reporting too early. Subsequently, the host and guests exchanged songs, ballads, Beijing opera excerpts, and drum verses before dispersing. (28th) Feng Yuxiang does not want to participate in party affairs.</p>
<p>Wang Faqin, a representative of the Beijing reorganization faction, went to Zhengzhou to visit Feng Yuxiang and asked him for assistance in resolving party affairs issues and convening a congress.

<p>International Important News</p>
<p>German New Financial Plan</p>
<p>Premier and Finance Minister Jointly Propose</p>
<p>Reduce General Expenditure</p>
<p>Reform Unemployment Insurance</p>
<p>Has Been Approved by the Federal Council</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 28th The day after Premier Brüning formally introduced the new Finance Minister, Dr. Dietrich, he personally put forward a new financial plan, the content of which was slightly different from that proposed by the former Finance Minister, Moldenhauer, and followed the demands of the central and left-wing parties to greatly reduce ordinary expenditures. In addition, there has also been a thorough reform of the unemployment insurance and benefit payment system, with the aim of greatly reducing the subsidies allocated by the national treasury. The plan details the new Finance Minister's various proposals for improving finance.</p>
<p>There are many pages, and it is now handed over to the Budget Committee for careful review. It is hoped that the government and the party newspaper will, on this basis, agree and account for a majority in Congress, because it is said that the President does not want to lightly use Article 48 of the Constitution and rely on the Cabinet's extraordinary</p>
<p>power to promulgate laws by administrative order.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 28th The German new financial plan, proposed by the new Finance Minister, which aims to offset the 700 million marks of budget deficit, was passed by the Federal Council today. The most noteworthy thing is the salary tax and the unmarried tax for men and women, which are the most fiercely contested by the parties. It is now proposed to levy 2.5% on all civil servants' salaries, and the income tax of the people has also been slightly increased. For those with higher incomes, a progressive method is adopted, up to 5%. This case applies to all annual salaries exceeding 8,000 marks. In addition, unmarried adult men and women will be charged a surcharge. This case was jointly proposed by the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister. In his speech, he strongly stated that the state finances must be balanced, and even if the burden on the people is slightly increased temporarily, it is inevitable. Premier Brüning stated that today we have escaped from international fetters and redeemed our freedom with great sacrifices, and we must reorganize our finances and no longer increase debts to cultivate this freedom. The Finance Minister said that the current financial exhaustion of the country is partly due to the economic decline of the world and partly due to the evils left over by the war. In addition, in this period of economic decline, the country implements social policies and leaves little room for saving. Although all departments of the government have tried their best to reduce expenditures, the savings do not exceed 100 million marks. However, it is not appropriate to increase indirect taxes at this time, so the government believes that the proposed plan is the only remedy at present, which is enough to encourage industrial activity, expand production, increase employment, and develop domestic resources. It also said that the government is doing its best to suppress the current high prices, and it is expected that the parliament will also pass this case in the current situation, because most of the members seem to have understood that this is the most suitable method at present.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 28th Prime Minister Dr. Brüning announced in Parliament today new taxes to make up for the budget deficit and fund the relief of 1.6 million unemployed people: the unmarried tax for men and women can generate 110,000,000 marks per year, a 5% surcharge on income exceeding £400 can generate 58,000,000 marks, a one-time emergency tax on actual salaries can generate 135,000,000 marks, and budget cuts in various departments can save 100,000,000 marks.</p>

At the same time, the German High Commissioner also laid flowers at the tombs of Allied soldiers who died in the area to show friendship. German police teams have now set off to the border of the occupied areas, and as soon as foreign troops leave the country on Sunday afternoon, they will enter to take over defense.</p>

<p>Prepare to Conquer the Poles</p>
<p>Next Year Will Be the Second [International Polar Year]</p>
<p>World News Agency, Washington The Norwegian polar explorer Sverre announced recently in a speech to the American Geographical Association that the world will cooperate between 1932 and 1933 to conquer the Arctic. Denmark, Germany, Russia, Norway, and Spain have already planned official expeditions as part of the [International Polar Year] program. The United States, Canada, Japan, and other European countries will each set up Arctic observatories, but there have been no formal actions. The first [International Polar Year] was fifty years ago, and so far twelve countries have participated in fourteen expeditions, setting up a circle of observatories around the magnetic poles. It is expected that there will be greater cooperation next year. The program for next year is currently being drafted by an international committee of meteorologists. It is planned to set up two new sets of observatories at the North and South Poles, one surrounding the magnetic poles and the other following the polar peaks. It is also planned to set up a network of aurora observatories, with a station every hundred miles, and to equip exploration balloons to measure meteorology.</p>
<p>Japan-Soviet Fishing Negotiations</p>
<p>Conflicting Views on the Scope of Territorial Waters</p>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 29th The Russian side has been increasing pressure on Japanese fishing boats fishing off the Russian coast, and recently it has become even more blatant. The Showa factory ship Harumi Maru (3,600 tons) was fishing four nautical miles off the coast of Kamchatka when a Russian state-run fishing ground boat demanded that the ship stop fishing and confiscated the nets. Japanese fishermen were greatly angered and immediately dispatched a suicide squad in small boats, avoiding Russian gunfire, and boarded a Russian surveillance ship, capturing five Russian surveillance personnel and handing them over to the Japanese destroyer Hayakaze. It is said that the Japanese fishermen were adhering to the international three-nautical-mile territorial waters theory, while the Russian side still adheres to the twelve-nautical-mile territorial waters theory from the imperial era, so disputes have repeatedly arisen. In order to avoid disputes between the two sides, diplomatic negotiations are necessary. The Japanese government seems to have sent a telegram to Ambassador Tanaka yesterday, stating that if the Russian state-run fisheries authorities do not change their attitude and continue to expel Japanese fishermen, similar disputes will continue to occur.</p>

<p>Reuters, Paris, 28th The first to respond to the French Foreign Minister Briand's suggestion to European countries to organize a European Federation was the Spanish government, which expressed its agreement to the suggestion but with the proviso that the colonial relations of Europe must not be hindered as a result.</p>
<p>International Labor Conference Resolution</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 28th The International Labor Conference today passed the Convention on the Abolition of Forced Labor in Colonies.

<p>Berlin Extremists Demonstrate</p>
<p>In Front of the British Consulate</p>
<p>Clashes with the Police</p>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 28th Extremists gathered in front of the British Consulate today to demonstrate and were dispersed by the police. Although there were many Communists mixed in, the original intention of the demonstration was to oppose British rule in India. Among the crowd were those carrying flags demanding Indian independence. The police first warned the crowd not to approach the British Consulate, but the crowd ignored them, so they clashed, resulting in minor injuries to several people.</p>
<p>US Navy Dismantles Old Submarines</p>

<p>Japanese Train Burial Incident</p>

Most of them have been safely rescued. Three railway staff and two passengers were unfortunately dug out, but they had already died and could not be revived. In addition, there were two seriously injured. In general, this kind of incident is considered fortunate among misfortunes due to the small number of deaths and injuries.</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Hamaguchi's Political Talk</p>
<p>Savings Budget Does Not Include Navy and Army</p>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 29th Prime Minister Hamaguchi went to the Kamakura villa by car from the official residence at half past four yesterday afternoon. Regarding the current situation, he told visiting reporters that the procedures for consulting on the London Treaty are currently being prepared, but a report that preparations are complete has not yet been received. It would be a major problem if the Privy Council's review is delayed until the summer vacation, so special facilitation may be required during the summer vacation. Regarding the new national defense plan, the Minister of the Navy will briefly outline the main points at the Privy Council, but detailed specialized matters do not need to be described in detail. Negotiations on the implementation of the savings budget have not yet received a report, and it is feared that it will be difficult to start implementing them from July 1st. Although the Democratic Party seems to be aiming at sugar, textile consumption tax and other tax reductions and exemptions, the government still needs to conduct a great deal of research. The local public bonds for relieving unemployment are not contradictory to the non-debt-raising doctrine, but the unemployment situation in various places must be studied before strict restrictions can be allowed. Regarding the matter of creating a securities investment company to counter stock price declines, nothing has been heard and it has not been considered. There are various rumors about the government's change of policy. In fact, this has never been mentioned when meeting with industrialists, and there is no need for it now.</p>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 29th Abe, acting Minister of the Army, decided after careful study of the Ministry of Finance's request to reduce the Army's budget by 15 million yuan this year, that a total of 5.8 million yuan could be reduced and deferred. Absolutely no more than the above savings are allowed. The above reply has been given to the Ministry of Finance yesterday. The attitude of the Army is like this, and the Navy also has quite strong opinions. Finance Minister Inoue's political reform policy is gradually becoming pessimistic.

<p>Dukes Aircraft</p>
<p>Preparing to Cross the Atlantic</p>
<p>National News Agency, Frydliv, 28th The Dukes seaplane with twelve engines, built by the Dornier company, is the largest aircraft in the world today. Since its test flight last year, it has been refitted with new motors and is currently preparing to make several flights over the North Sea in preparation for attempting to cross the Atlantic next month. It is said that at that time, it will fly from Cadiz to the Azores, Bermuda, and then to New York, at a speed of 110 to 120 miles per hour, and it will take about nine hours to reach the Azores, another twenty hours to reach Bermuda, and another eight hours to reach New York. However, the aircraft consumes a lot of fuel, more than one ton per hour, so it may land several times on the way to refuel. It can accommodate 170 passengers, but at that time it will still be the first time to make an Atlantic flight, so it is planned not to carry too many passengers. It is now heard that an American millionaire intends to offer £4,000 to buy the right to ride this aircraft alone.</p>

<p>Five stones of wheat nearly caused two deaths. Sun Genhe, a farmer from Sunjia Village, which borders the first and eighth districts, harvested five stones of wheat and negotiated a price with a certain merchant. When he returned home to load and transport it, his wife, Huang, stopped him, saying that the price of wheat should be watched for further increases before selling it, and ordered him to cancel the deal. Sun returned the deposit and was severely scolded. Unexpectedly, the price of wheat has recently plummeted, losing 60-70 cents per stone. Sun attributed this loss to his wife's mistake. He initially scolded her, then beat her. Huang, unable to vent her anger, secretly bought opium, swallowed it, and lay down. Just as Huang's mother came to visit her daughter, she saw her pale face and initially suspected an epidemic. Upon learning of the marital discord, she realized it was poison and urgently invited a certain person named Jia, who specialized in treating poisonings, to administer treatment, causing her to vomit and recover. After Sun noticed that Huang had taken poison, he immediately went out. When Huang's mother saved her daughter's life and sought out her son-in-law to question him, his whereabouts were unknown. Fortunately, a neighbor grazing cattle saw someone floating on the river, seemingly not quite dead, and called for help loudly. After being rescued by the crowd, surgery was performed to force the water out, and she gradually recovered. If Huang's mother had not come to visit her daughter, or had been delayed even a moment, the couple would have perished together, a truly dangerous situation.</p>

They denied possessing any weapons. The two children, Mei Guangzi, also claimed to be employees of the Gongxing Fish Shop, but admitted that the weapons were purchased in Shanghai and brought onto the boat in the Shiliupu area and are now hidden in the house of Dong Qu in Chenmu.

<p>Six County Chambers of Commerce Appeal for Reduction of Yarn Tax Rates. Due to the insufficient supply of yarn from Zhejiang's yarn factories, the raw materials such as factory cloth, native cloth, foreign socks, etc., in the six counties under Jiaxing Prefecture of Zhejiang Province are mostly purchased from Shanghai. The yarn tax was originally a system of contracted merchants, and the factories were responsible for paying the tax, which was more than one yuan per piece. Since June of this year, Zhejiang Province has abolished the contracted merchant system, and the tax rates for factory yarn, foreign yarn, mercerized yarn, single-strand thread, and double-strand thread have increased to between four yuan, eight jiao, nine fen, six li and forty yuan, eight jiao per piece, including surcharges, which is very different from the previously agreed tax rates. Currently, the yarn tax rate in Jiangsu Province is only one liang and nine qian per piece for factory yarn and two liang and five qian for mercerized yarn. Therefore, the factories in the six counties bear a heavier burden than those in Jiangsu Province, and the cost of production is also different from that in Jiangsu Province, resulting in a sharp decline in business.

Cai's son, Amao, heard the noise and came out to investigate and was also shot in the waist and fell to the ground. The bandits robbed the silver dollars on the table and left. After the bandits left, the Cai family took Yin and A Mao to the Puren Hospital in Jiangdong, Ningbo. Amao died of his injuries, and Yin was not in danger after the bullet was removed by the doctor. It is said that the bandits went to Liu Village that night and robbed large and small shops, looting over 60 yuan in cash. Fortunately, no one was injured.</p>

<p>Baby Killed by Petty Thief Case. On the 24th, a shocking case occurred in Dong Street, Shaoxing, where a petty thief, only 12 years old, bit a baby girl who was just over a month old, an unprecedented tragedy in Yuezhou. On that day, a theatrical performance was being held in the public garden. Zhang Aquan and his wife were selling plum blossom cakes at a stall under the stage. They left their baby girl, who was only 40 days old, asleep alone in the boat. Because there was no one guarding the boat, Wang Zhushi's son, Amao (12 years old), got off the boat to steal something and woke the baby, who began to cry. The petty thief, fearing that his parents would notice, actually bit the baby to death. He went ashore to escape, but his face was covered in blood, attracting attention. He was immediately apprehended and sent to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau by the court for questioning. Meanwhile, the court sent personnel to examine the body. It was found that several pieces of skin and flesh had been bitten off from the head, and there were also bite marks on the abdomen. Someone has come forward to mediate the case, ordering Amao's mother to pay 100 yuan as compensation for the baby's life.</p>

<p>The Latest Situation of Low-Priced Rice Sales in the First District. The First District Ping Rice Selling Point of the Food Grain Distribution Association recently received a message from Ningbo stating that the price of Xiaojiao rice has increased by one yuan per stone due to the impact of the high cost of gold and the low value of silver. The selling point calculates that it is losing 3 yuan and 7 jiao per stone based on the current retail price of 14 yuan and 3 jiao. The total loss in the past ten periods has been over 8,000 yuan, and there are over 3,000 yuan left. It is planned to run for five more periods, but the current inventory is empty. The goods ordered from Shanghai and Ningbo are expected to arrive three days after the scheduled date for low-priced rice sales. Unexpectedly, seeing that the high prices are deterring buyers, the rice shops are transporting their stockpiled rice to Dongguan and other places in Shaoxing Prefecture. In order to take care of both the people's food supply and the profits of the Food Grain Distribution Association, the organizers have decided, after discussion, that the price of Dajiao rice sold in the city will remain at the low price of 14 yuan and 3 jiao. The price of Xiaojiao rice sold in Dong, which is more expensive, will increase by 7 jiao to be sold at 15 yuan. On the 27th, it was submitted to the county government for approval to imitate the Ningbo Municipal Government's order to rice merchants to stockpile 200,000 stones of rice for emergency needs to ban grain merchants from exporting rice for relief. The Ping Rice Selling Point in the city is temporarily suspended due to the slow arrival of goods.</p>

Upon receiving the report, Zhang, the commander of the Second Cavalry Division, ordered Ge Wucheng, the commander of the Third Brigade stationed in Chuzhou, to be responsible for the suppression. After receiving the order, Ge ordered the 12th Regiment stationed in Bengbu, the 9th Regiment stationed in Pu, the First Battalion stationed in Chuzhou, and the 7th Regiment stationed in Mingguang to dispatch two companies of soldiers each, led by Ge himself and supervised by the regimental commanders, to launch an operation from Zhangbaling on the 21st of this month.

<h3>Details of Han Fuju's Abandonment of Jinan</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, 24th - After the Jin army arrived at Changqing on the 23rd, Han Fuju decided to abandon Jinan and move east along the Jiaoji Railway due to the thorny diplomatic situation and strategic considerations in Jinan. At 1:00 PM on the 23rd, Han Fuju convened an emergency meeting of important generals at the headquarters of the First Army Corps. Attendees included Chief Advisor Li Shuchun, Chief of Staff Zhang Cheng, Li Zongbi, Commander of the 14th Army Cao Fulin, and Acting Garrison Commander Lei Taiping. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. Although the details are unknown, it is understood that a considerable decision has been made regarding the retreat plan. Generally, the various units under his command will take Jiaoji Railway trains from Jinan to Puj, Zhoucun, Zhangdian, Qingzhou, Fangzi, Qingdao, and other places, and then proceed to the Haizhou area in different directions. The most important routes are roughly divided into four: one route goes from Zhangdian through Boshan, out of Qingshi Pass, towards Laiwu, and south along the mountain road through Xintai and Mengyin; one route goes from Qingzhou through Linqu, taking the road to Yishui and Linyi to the south; one route goes from Fangzi through Anqiu, taking the road to Zhucheng and Rizhao to the south; and one route goes from Qingdao by boat to Haizhou. After the meeting decided on the plan, Han ordered the various armies to prepare for the retreat yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM. Therefore, from last night, the various units of the Han army have been transporting military supplies and luggage to the Jiaoji Railway Station one after another. The sound of automobiles continued all night. Twenty empty trains were prepared by the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways for transporting the army back and forth. The soldiers boarded the trains at the Huangtaiqiao and Jinan stations on the night of the 23rd. This morning (the 24th) at 1:10 AM, the first train began transporting troops to Qingdao, and the remaining trains also departed east one after another. By 7:00 PM, ten trains had departed. Han Fuju's special train is also at the station, with its fires lit, ready to depart. The families of important people and important items are all going south by boat from Qingdao, while the troops are heading to Zhangdian, Fangzi, Qingzhou, and other places, and then marching south on foot. It is estimated that the evacuation can be completed tonight. Han Fuju and his party will take the last train east. This afternoon, the Jin army had reached Duandian, near Jinan, just over ten miles from Jinan. In order to stabilize people's hearts, Han Fuju issued a temporary announcement today, which stated: "Regarding the announcement, Jinan is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, and merchants gather. The current situation is difficult to change, and the responsibility for protection lies with the local authorities. As long as our army is in Jinan, we will fulfill our responsibility every day. Anyone who disturbs the lives and property of Chinese and foreigners will be shot without pardon." After this announcement was posted, people's hearts were slightly calmed. The administrative organs in Jinan also underwent major changes due to the withdrawal of the Han army. Since dawn, personnel from various organs have been moving their luggage out or boarding trains to the east. Chen Tiaoyuan's headquarters, which was still partly stationed in the provincial government, also boarded trains from Huangtaiqiao Station this morning and went east. Today was originally the date for the regular meeting of the provincial government committee, but it was suspended and changed to a discussion meeting to discuss countermeasures. Since the Han army has withdrawn, administrative personnel have no choice but to follow. It was decided that all documents from various organs would not be taken, and a few people would be left to keep them for handover after the Jin army arrives. As for the personnel of various organs, they are free to choose whether to go east or stay in Jinan. However, because the matter occurred suddenly, funds could not be raised, so the salaries for June have not been paid. Personnel from various organs are complaining incessantly. By the afternoon, the various organs had been deserted, with only a few security guards standing guard at the entrances. The various committee members and directors have also hidden or left Jinan. Only Han Fuju and the acting chairman of the government, Zhu Xi, are still in Jinan and plan to go east together tonight. The consuls of various countries stationed in Jinan are extremely concerned about the security of Jinan, as it relates to the lives and property of their respective nationals. At 6:00 PM on the 23rd, the consuls of Britain, the United States, Germany, and Japan visited Han Fuju at the First Army Corps headquarters. Han formally stated to the consuls that Jinan is an area where Chinese and foreigners gather, and that if the war spreads to Jinan, it would be contrary to the original purpose of protecting overseas Chinese. Therefore, it was decided to withdraw voluntarily and leave Jinan completely within three to four days starting from the 24th. The security of Jinan will be fully assumed by the security team and several thousand police officers of the Public Security Bureau, and there will be no unexpected dangers. The consuls immediately telegraphed Han's intentions to the ministers of various countries in Beiping, requesting them to convey them to the important generals of the Jin army and properly protect the lives and property of foreigners when entering Jinan. At 10:00 AM on the 24th, the consuls of various countries went to the provincial government to inquire about everything. The provincial government also stated that the security team and the Public Security Bureau were responsible for maintaining the security of Jinan. In the afternoon, the consuls of various countries discussed temporary measures to maintain security before the arrival of the Jin army.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, 25th - The details of Han Fuju's army withdrawing from Jinan by train were reported yesterday. According to further investigation, the Han army continued to be transported east last night.

<p>departed together from Jinan in a special train at 3:10 AM this morning. The last of Han Fuju's army to withdraw from Jinan was Sun Tongxuan's unit, the Zhan Shutang Brigade, which withdrew from Changqing at dawn today, entered the city along the commercial port, exited the east gate, and marched east along the Jiaoji Railway from Huangtaiqiao. The part stationed at Luokou also retreated east on foot at 5:00 AM this morning. Zhao Yibang, director of the Jinan Arsenal, took the 6th Jiaoji Railway train to Qingdao at 8:30 AM this morning. Around 7:00 AM this morning, a vanguard of plainclothes soldiers from the Jin army crossed the river from Luokou and arrived at Xincheng, Jinan Arsenal. Li Fuying, commander of the 5th Army of the Jin army, had arrived at Baishui Jing near Luokou on the north bank of the Yellow River. Because the arsenal was important, he immediately sent two companies of soldiers to garrison the factory. However, because he had not yet received an order from Fu Zuoyi, he did not immediately march towards Jinan city. At the same time, Feng Pengzhu's 9th Army also arrived at Duandian. The Jinan General Chamber of Commerce sent representatives Liu Zicheng and Zhu Shouqing to Luokou by car at 8:00 AM this morning to make contact with the Jin army. A platoon of the Jin army had already crossed the river. After Liu and Zhu explained their intentions, Li Fuying sent Wang Bingtian, the chief of his communications office, to accompany Zhu, Liu, and others to Jinan by car to discuss everything. At that time, the Chamber of Commerce was convening representatives from the business community and local gentry. Those who attended included Mu Xianglin, the temporary director of the Public Security Bureau, Xin Zhujiu from the Chamber of Commerce, and local gentry He Chunjang and Ma Liang, totaling more than 200 people. Mu Xianglin presided over the meeting and reported the purpose of the meeting, which was to organize a joint association of merchants and civilians, with He Chunjang, Ma Liang, and Mu Xianglin as the president and vice presidents, and Jin Luheng and Sun Xiaofang as the six people responsible for office work. At this time, Wang Bingtian, the representative of Li Fuying, had arrived at the General Chamber of Commerce in the city. According to his statement, he sincerely hoped that no slogans would be posted to avoid disputes, and said that the Jin army was particularly cautious regarding diplomatic matters, so it did not launch a fierce attack on Jinan. The commanders of the Second and Fourth Route Joint Army of the Jin army attacking Shandong were Zhang Yinwu and Fu Zuoyi. The Fourth Route on the Luokou front was the 5th Army of Li Fuying, with the 15th Division of Jia Xueming being the frontline, and the 44th Regiment of Li Lebin being the full regiment. The Ninth Army of Feng Pengzhu, the Tenth Army of Fu Zuoyi, and the Fourth Army of Li Shengda were on the Changqing front. The Third Army of Wang Zhian was on the Qingcheng front. The 26th Division Commander Gao Hongwen's troops arrived at Duandian. It is said that each sector further deliberated and appointed Zhong Boren, Zhu Runtao, Li Ren'an, and Jin Luheng to Luokou to contact Li Fuying, and Wang Mochen and Han Yuanzhang to Duandian to contact Gao Hongwen. At 12:00 noon, Gao Hongwen's troops first entered the commercial port. Gao dismounted and stayed at the former Negotiation Office on Sixth Avenue. According to Gao's conversation, his troops had sent two regiments, the 76th Regiment of Shen Chengchang, stationed in the Civil Affairs Hall in the city, and the 77th Regiment of Wang Benshan, stationed in the commercial port. The 78th Regiment was in the Hongmiao Mashan area.</p>

<h3>Rampant Banditry in Huoshan and Liu'an</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence - Recently, due to the merger with the remnants of Yu Yanong's bandit forces, the number of bandits in Liu'an has increased sharply. A few days ago, they successively harassed Guozhi, Liubo, and Mapu in Huoshan County, and attempted to attack the county seat of Huoshan. Pan Shousan, commander of the 3rd Regiment of the newly编 Fifth Brigade stationed in Huoshan, upon hearing the news, immediately led his troops to Xiabuqiao, 90 miles from Liu'an, to intercept them. The bandits also resisted stubbornly. After a stalemate of about ten hours, Pan's regiment abandoned Xiabuqiao and concentrated its forces in the Shangqingshi area due to its smaller numbers. When more than 100 people from the Huoshan Self-Defense Regiment, the 3rd Regiment, and plainclothes teams rushed to support, the bandits had already directly attacked the county seat. Currently, Pan's regiment is firmly defending Liu'an. The New Fifth Brigade has hired five boats to transport a large amount of military supplies to provide assistance, hoping to annihilate the bandits in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Bandits in the east of Liu'an and communists in the west have been disturbing the area almost every day since last autumn. Although the stationed troops have been dispatched to search and suppress them from time to time, the bandits rely on the towering mountains to hide and are not easily eradicated. A few days ago, they made an all-out effort to directly attack Mapu and Dushan in the western countryside. The military and police were caught off guard and retreated to Sujiapu to defend the river. Unexpectedly, the bandits turned and secretly traveled around the mountains, taking the early road on the southern route to directly attack Liucheng. Fortunately, the troops of Pan's Regiment of the New Fifth Brigade and the Self-Defense Regiment jointly increased their suppression efforts and finally repelled the bandits. As for the Qianshan area, several hundred bandits and communists recently divided into three routes and attempted to attack the county seat. County Magistrate Cui Shulong personally led the regiment and police to resist bravely and dispatched a unit out of the west gate to surround the bandits behind Taoyuan. The bandits were defeated. In this battle, more than ten bandits were killed and several rifles were seized. The Independent 15th Brigade has sent Luo's Regiment to Qianshan to search and suppress them. (27th)</p>

<h3>Beining Railway</h3>
<p>Bandits Discovered at Goubangzi Station</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence - A train robbery occurred on the Beining Railway several months ago. After the Northeast Transportation Authority reported to the military and political authorities, the various garrisons and county police along the railway line were instructed to pay attention to protection and assist in defense in case of bandit alarms. For several months, it has been considered safe. However, the westward passenger train on the 23rd of this month was unexpectedly delayed. After investigating in various directions, it was learned that a group of bandits with fairly complete weaponry had been discovered near Goubangzi Station earlier that morning. Because they had learned that the train was carrying a large sum of money to be distributed along the stations, they attempted to carry out a robbery. The railway police were weak and unable to support them. After the 2nd Brigade of the garrison force in the area was dispatched, the bandits were repelled. The train departed east from Goubangzi at 9:00 AM and arrived in Shenyang as late as 11:00 AM, delayed by four or five hours. According to merchants from Goubangzi who came to Shenyang on the train, bandits have been rampant in the area since summer. The army and railway police are unable to prevent them. On the 14th of this month, a large group of bandits kidnapped Zhang, a wealthy household in Zhangjiawobao, and more than a dozen people in charge of a distillery, as well as soldiers. When the officials and soldiers received the report, they went to pursue them and captured two bandits. Unexpectedly, the bandits were audacious and united with more than 300 bandits to suddenly claim at 12:00 at night on the 22nd outside the foreign flag southwest of the station, demanding the return of the two arrested bandits, otherwise they would use force. The army immediately encircled and suppressed them, and both sides opened fire. Gunshots rang out for a time, causing the Beining express train to stop at the station. Passengers were lying under the train compartments to avoid danger, waiting for about three hours before the train passed and arrived in Shenyang.</p>

<h3>Letter from Lei Jiajun of Songjiang</h3>
<p>To the Editor: The news about a lodger exploring a landlord and theft in the Songjiang Communications column on the 26th of this month is inconsistent with the facts. The theft case is highly suspicious of my landlord Li Zhou and Shen Zhaosheng, so I immediately reported it to the Public Security Bureau. During the trial, Li Zhou suddenly confessed that Jun had borrowed 350 yuan from her and raped her. That is why I was accused of framing her because of suspicion. May I ask, if the loan and rape occurred last year, why not investigate and appeal at that time? It must be waited until Jun reported the theft before it can be raised, and there is no reason to be seen. I am afraid that people from all walks of life do not understand the truth and related to my reputation, so I specifically ask you to post it in the column of people's letters to clarify the truth. Lei Jiajun respectfully</p>

<h3>Casual Notes on Japanese Education</h3>
<p>(10) (Hu Shuyi)</p>
<p>Kyoto is the old capital of Japan. Foreigners who go to Japan for inspection must first arrive in Kyoto. This is because Kyoto is not only an important political and educational city in Japan, but also rich in historical connections. Its beautiful scenery and numerous historical sites are unmatched in the country. During my stay in Kyoto, due to time constraints, I only visited Arashiyama and Mount Hiei. The scenery of Arashiyama is famous for its mountains and rivers. The mountains are full of pine and bamboo, and the water is clear. Walking along the mountain, the winding paths are extremely winding. I went with Jin Qun and others for an evening stroll, hiring a small boat to drift among them. The setting sun shone through the pine forest, reflecting on the water's surface, creating a beautiful color that resembled a natural painting. At the foot of the mountain are hotels and restaurants for tourists to eat and stay. The scenery of Arashiyama is best enjoyed on moonlit nights, so tourists often visit the mountain on moonlit nights. There are many famous scenic spots such as Togetsukyo Bridge, Arashiyama Gorge Ferry, and Arashiyama Hot Springs. The scenery is no less than the "Autumn Moon over the Peaceful Lake" at the West Lake in Hangzhou. Mount Hiei is a famous scenic spot that embraces science. There are mountain climbing trams and aerial trams spanning the tops of the two mountains. Climbing the mountain and looking out over Lake Biwa, the mountain colors and lake scenery are breathtaking. Then, we visited the Shimadzu Corporation Manufacturing Plant. This plant is the largest scientific instrument company in Japan. It has branches in Tokyo, Osaka, Dalian, and Berlin, Germany. It has been in business for fifty years, manufacturing physics and chemistry equipment and various medicines, achieving renowned results in various countries. We were led by the director of the trading department of the plant to visit: (1) the Science Hall, equipped with various scientific equipment for testing and experimentation, including indoor electrical and darkroom equipment; (2) the Physics Equipment Exhibition Hall, displaying metrological measuring instruments, optical, acoustic, thermal, magnetic, and electrical instruments, as well as the layout of school science experiment rooms; (3) the Chemistry Equipment Exhibition Hall, displaying various medicines and chemical experimental application instruments; (4) the Natural History Specimen Exhibition Hall, collecting natural history specimens to perfection; (5) the Psychological Experiment Equipment Exhibition Hall, displaying models of the human nervous system and various sensory organs, as well as performance testing instruments such as stimulators, reaction time measuring instruments, hearing testing instruments, and vision and color blindness testing instruments. In addition, there are X-ray equipment rooms and ultraviolet ray testing rooms to identify the authenticity or quality of objects using fluorescence. The guide used rubies, ivory, and silkworm cocoons for ultraviolet ray testing, which can be used to distinguish the authenticity of rubies and ivory, as well as the quality of silkworm cocoons. It is said that the Shimadzu Corporation Manufacturing Plant was a small shop when it was founded. Decades later, it has developed into the number one scientific instrument manufacturing company in Japan, with a capital of over three million. The speed of its progress can be used to measure the development of the entrepreneurial spirit of the people of that country. I also made an appointment with the Japan-China Society. The next day, I went to Nara to visit, while Jin Qun stayed in Kyoto to continue his investigation. After hurriedly packing, I took an express train from Kyoto to Nara. Nara is the oldest capital of Japan. After traveling for more than an hour, I arrived and stayed at the Daibutsu Temple Hotel. In the afternoon, I visited Nara Women's Higher Normal School. The principal, Eiji Ueyama, came out to meet us and discussed the goal of Japanese women's education, which is to develop women's individuality while developing women's natural talents from the perspective of society, the country, and the world. The school was founded in the 32nd year of the Meiji era and has seven departments: (1) Undergraduate Department, (2) Research Department, (3) Nursery Teacher Training Department, (4) Attached Girls' High School, (5) Attached Vocational Girls' High School, (6) Attached Elementary School, (7) Attached Kindergarten. The three departments of the Undergraduate Department, Research Department, and Nursery Teacher Training Department have 464 students, including 27 Chinese female students. The Attached Girls' High School has 450 students, the Attached Vocational Girls' High School has 215 students, the Attached Elementary School has 424 students, and the Attached Kindergarten has 235 students. The undergraduate department of the Higher Normal School is divided into four departments: Chinese and Literature Department, Geography and History Department, Mathematics and Chemistry Department, and Natural History and Home Economics Department. There have been nine classes of graduates, totaling hundreds of people, all of whom are teaching in secondary schools throughout Japan. The annual recurring expenses are about 238,000 yuan. Then, the principal introduced Ms. Wang Xiuying, a student in the research department of the school, to serve as a translator. Ms. Wang is from Zunyi, Guizhou Province. After graduating from the undergraduate department of the school, she entered the research department to study biology. It is said that she will graduate in one year. Ms. Wang is fluent in language and has abundant abilities. It is undoubtedly clear at first glance that she is a top student of the Women's Higher Normal School. Then, I talked to the director of the attached elementary school about student training issues. There are four points to note: (1) Honesty is the main point, so that students have free will to act; (2) Honesty is practiced in self-discipline and collaborative activities. This is the standard of daily life; (3) Learning and training are one. Cultivation is obtained in learning. In terms of physical education, students are made to exercise voluntarily, so that their bodies develop naturally. This is the basis of physical education. Then, we talked about the learning method. The school is testing work education. The standard is based on (1) automatic learning, (2) voluntary activities, (3) automatic planning for the development of life. In terms of methods, there are two types: independent learning and mutual learning. The former allows children to learn by themselves according to their circumstances, with teachers guiding them by the side. The latter allows children to engage in mutual learning after independent learning. When applying this method, it is most important to organize and provide a suitable environment. On the teacher's side, guidance and demonstration are carried out in parallel. The goal is to enable students to discover problems and solve them themselves. Roughly speaking, this kind of education is quite similar to the design method and whole teaching method prevalent in our country. The director of the school is rich in experience and has profound research on elementary school education. After this reading, I learned a little about the recent trend of new education in Japan, and I was presented with many of my own works and publications of the school. When I go back, I will sort them out in detail and benefit a lot. (In Nara)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>Pay attention to the activities of the Dongwen Observation Group</p>
<p>The Central Executive Committee sent a letter requesting a ban</p>
<p>Divided letters to the interior and foreign ministries to find a way</p>
<p>A group of people from the Japanese education community formed the Dongwen Observation Group. Several people will come to China from Japan to investigate various undertakings in the mainland and the situation in the interior. The Central Executive Committee once received a report from the Beijing Municipal Executive Committee stating that the group, under the name of observation, actually harbored the ambition of cultural aggression. It requested attention and hoped to ban it. The Central Executive Committee forwarded the letter to the Ministry of Education, requesting it to investigate and handle it on its behalf. Now, the Ministry of Education has divided letters to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting the Ministry of Interior to order the civil affairs and public security bureaus of various provinces and cities to pay attention to the activities and movements of the group at any time and take appropriate measures to stop them. At the same time, it requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to suspend the issuance of observation passports to the group in order to prevent its travel and avoid damaging national rights.</p>

<h3>Actively preparing for the establishment of the Boy Scout Council</h3>
<p>Funding is available, and establishment is in sight</p>
<p>There are already 15 Boy Scout troops in this city that have registered with the Central Government. According to the organizational regulations of the Municipal Council, a Municipal Council should be organized as the commanding authority of the city's Boy Scouts. The development of the Boy Scout cause in this city has always been at the forefront of various places. The Boy Scout Association was the highest authority. Since the promulgation of the Party Boy Scout regulations, the association has also been cancelled for some reason. Instead, there are organizations of divisions and military departments. Now, the city is planning to establish regulations for divisions, and there has been a sudden change to the Council. The training department of the city party headquarters believes that the Boy Scout Council is closely related to the past glory and future development of the Boy Scouts in this city, so it is also eager to prepare. The financial aspect alone needs to be prepared early, so the training department, Department Boy Scout, personally requested the Director of the Municipal Education Bureau to allocate funds. Yesterday, it received an official document from the Municipal Education Bureau stating that the council's funding of 200 yuan per month has been confirmed. The original letter from the bureau to the municipal training department is transcribed below: Re: Your previous official letter, I understand that you have been instructed to allocate subsidies. 200 yuan per month will be allocated from the date of the establishment of the council. I hereby reply to this letter in response and hope you will take note of it. Sincerely, the Training Department of the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, Chen Dezheng, Director of the Shanghai Special City Education Bureau. It is heard that the municipal training department has immediately ordered the Party Ideology Education Section to actively prepare.</p>

<h3>Fudan University Representatives Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>Visit the Minister of Education to Approve the Filing of the Law School</p>
<p>Shanghai Private Fudan University filed with the Ministry of Education of the National Government the year before last. Last summer, in accordance with the newly promulgated university regulations, the Department of Social Sciences was reorganized. The original law courses were merged to form the Law Department, along with the original Political Science, Municipal Administration, and Economics departments. It was renamed the School of Law and submitted to the Ministry of Education for filing. It was approved that the Law Department be temporarily suspended from being established, which fundamentally raised the question of the School of Law. The school authorities believed that the Department of Social Sciences had been established long before the filing. The subsequent reorganization was purely to seek legal content and there was no change in content. As for the law department courses, they had been opened successively for five years and had been completed early. According to the law, merging them into a department would increase funding, but it was not comparable to a newly added department. The Ministry of Education did not understand the truth and gave rise to a misunderstanding. The Faculty Council specially recommended three professors, Sun Hanbing, Wu Banggao, and Ying Yicheng, to go to Beijing to explain everything to the education authorities. It is heard that the alumni of the school in Beijing hosted a banquet for the representatives at the China Hotel last night. Sun, Wu, and Ying and the old professors and old alumni of the school, Liu Luyin, Sun Benzhi, Yu Jingtang, Duanmu Kai, Shou Miancheng, Wu Mian, and Lu Rongguang, and others, attended the banquet. There was much laughter and joy during the banquet. Sun Benwen is currently the Director of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education and is extremely familiar with the past situation. He immediately introduced the representatives of the school to Minister Jiang Menglin for a detailed explanation. The representatives were satisfied with the contact and will return to Shanghai to report to the school in the next few days.</p>

<h3>Concerning the Dispute over the School Building of Shanghai College of Law and Politics</h3>
<p>The Shanghai College of Law and Politics was recently approved for registration by the Ministry of Education. However, it is said that the dispute over the school building is still a problem. The creditors of the college, Changsheng Construction Company, Liu Yinsheng, and others, have repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Education because the mortgage right of the school building is not guaranteed. It is learned from inquiries that the Ministry of Education issued an instruction stating: "The Ministry of Education hereby approves the petition from Changsheng Construction Company, Liu Yinsheng, and others regarding the unpaid debts for the school building of the private Shanghai College of Law and Politics. Upon investigation, the private Shanghai College of Law and Politics has been approved for registration by this Ministry. Regarding the school building issue of the said college, the Higher Education Department of this Ministry previously sent a letter, but the Board of Directors of the said college replied that for the sake of peace, the college is extremely willing to be responsible for the settlement. However, the other party has neither come to the college for negotiation nor presented evidence, resulting in a delay in resolving the issue. From now on, the other party should be urged again to come for negotiation as soon as possible to start substantive settlement. In addition to instructing the Shanghai Special Municipality Education Bureau to inform the said college accordingly, this notice is hereby issued for information. June 26th, the 19th year of the Republic of China."</p>

<h3>Women's Table Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>Guangdong Team Champion: Lin Murong</p>
<p>Guest Team Champion: She Xueer</p>
<p>The long-awaited Guangdong Women's Table Tennis Team Individual Annual Tournament and Guest Performance Competition were held at the Zhongshan Association the day before yesterday. First, Chairman Yu Binqi and Zeng Rongzong reported, and Li Ruifen gave a short speech, stating that although there is no lack of advocates for women's sports in our country, it has not yet become widespread among all levels of families and society. Table tennis equipment is simple and most suitable for women to exercise their bodies and minds, so today's event is held in the hope that ladies from all walks of life will promote it together. At eight o'clock, Yu Binqi and Luo Hongsheng took their positions, and Zhong Wuming and Lu Zhongqiu determined their positions. At the sound of the silver horn, there was thunderous applause. The results are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Guangdong Team</p>
<p>Champion: Lin Murong, Runner-up: Lin Muzhao</p>
<p>Third Place: Ma Baokun, Fourth Place: Li Ruifen</p>
<p>Fifth Place: Wei Peiyun, Sixth Place: Zheng Lihua</p>
<p>Guest Team</p>
<p>Champion: She Xueer, Runner-up: Guo Guangji</p>
<p>Third Place: Chen Baojin, Fourth Place: Huang Yimin</p>
<p>Brief Comment on the Skills: The weather was extremely hot that night, and more than 500 guests gathered, leaving no room for those who arrived late. The luxurious prizes made the players strive to fight. Lin Ruyi, Zheng Yuhua, Zhang Runzhu, Li Guiluan, Feng Xiaoji, etc., were eliminated in the first round, among which Zhang Runzhu had the best skills and had the hope of getting fifth place. Unfortunately, she met Zheng Lihua. Although she lost, she was still glorious. In the second elimination, Li Ruifen and Ma Baokun were the most exciting because Li attacked fiercely and Ma defended skillfully, one back and forth, one near and one far, which was greatly admired by the guests. As a result, Li was defeated due to lack of strength. In the third time, the round-robin system was adopted. Lin Murong, Lin Rongzhao, and Ma Baokun competed in the round-robin. As a result, Lin Murong's defensive skills were proper and her changes were endless, which truly qualified her for the championship. In the guest team, She Xueer was proficient in defensive skills. Although Guo Guangji was not weak, his defensive ball was too high, which led to his failure against She. Chen Baojin and Huang Yimin's skills were average and they had been out of practice for a long time. If they can work hard and strive, they are also promising.</p>
<h3>Table Tennis Tournament Held in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Yu Binqi Went to Preside Over</p>
<p>The development of table tennis throughout the country is led by Shanghai, followed by Wuxi and the capital Suzhou. However, Hangzhou, which is great, has rarely promoted it. Yu Binqi, a member of the National Table Tennis Association, has been in contact with players in the area several times to hold an individual championship competition there. Because no one presided over the skills, it could not be done in one fell swoop. It is now heard that Mr. Yu will go to Hangzhou today to contact Zhu Kongyang and Xie Mingyi to arrange the competition. The prizes have been presented by Guo Fuhai, a player attending the Far East Games, with a silver shield for the champion and two medals from the Shanghai Standard Sports Equipment Company.</p>
<h3>Chinese Handball Singles Starts Today</h3>
<p>The All-Shanghai Chinese Handball Singles Competition initiated by the Shanghai YMCA is divided into three groups: A, B, and C. The selection committee of the association decided that because there are more players in Group C, the competition will start at 5:30 PM today at the association's handball court. Groups A and B will compete successively on Wednesday (the 2nd). It is heard that the registration will take two weeks to complete. The association has invited Zhu Kuan, Gu Yongzhao, Xu Changqing, Chen Fuzhang, He Yiling, and Xi Tao to be the referees. Today's competition order is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Lin Lesheng vs. Yu Guanghan</p>
<p>(2) Luo Shunda vs. Le Yusheng</p>

<h3>Small Football Match in City Stadium One</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, there were two small football matches at City Stadium One. At 3:00 PM, Haixing played Huayou in the preliminary round. The scorching sun was in the sky, and sweat poured down like rain. The players' spirits were inevitably perfunctory, and there was little excitement. After a while, Haixing unintentionally scored a goal. Huayou quickly counterattacked, and the battle was fierce, with the ball changing hands constantly. In the end, Huayou lost another goal due to slightly lax defense, resulting in a score of 2-0. Haixing won. At 4:00 PM, City Team A played Yanqun. City Team A is skilled in tactics and has long been famous in the small football world. Unfortunately, in this match, six people were on the field, lacking one strong player, which greatly reduced their strength. However, they still charged forward and tried their best to cope, showing no weakness. Finally, due to fatigue from running, they lost a goal at the end of the first half. At the beginning of the second half, City Team A's Wang Boyong joined the team, making up the full complement, and their momentum increased greatly. They launched continuous attacks and were unstoppable. However, they were too eager and their footwork was inaccurate. They shot more than ten times but did not score once. In the end, Yanqun defeated them with a score of 1-0.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Organizes the Green Light Tennis Team</h3>
<p>Captain: Guo Qida... Vice-Captain: Zhu Qiqing</p>
<p>Yuan Shilong, Hou Shangxiong, and others from Nanshi, in view of the disunity of players in Nanshi, initiated the organization of a tennis team to connect feelings and practice together, and decided to use Green Light to compete with the strong teams in Shanghai after the formation of the team, and planned to join the Shanghai Tennis Association's competition from this season. It is heard that Guo Qida has been appointed as the team captain, Zhu Qiqing as the vice-captain, Xia Yuege as the team leader, Yuan Shilong as the accountant, Wang Wuchen as the secretary, and Gong Zhenyi and Hou Shangxiong as the staff. Players who have joined include Shen Yongnian, Liu Quanzhou, Li Zhongnan, Jiang Tianpeng, Qian Zhongxuan, Lu Weisen, Hu Huaqin, and others.</p>

<p>The China Industrial and Commercial Management Association, which had been in preparation for more than a month, held its opening ceremony at the Bank Association at 4 Hong Kong Road yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce came to Shanghai from Beijing to participate and delivered a speech on the spot, stating that [(1) improving personnel administration to enhance the service ethics and cooperative spirit of managers and those being managed; (2) improving production technology to eliminate various wastes; and (3) developing domestic industries to increase public welfare] should be the guiding principles for the association's future operations. The meeting discussed fifteen articles of the constitution and elected fifteen directors.

<p>Number of Attendees: Those in attendance included Kong Xiangxi, Mu Ouchu, Rong Zongjing, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Jici, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Riping, Qian Xinzhi, Liu Weichi, Li Quanshi, Hu Shu, Hua, Zhang Zhuping, Ma Chonggan, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yansong, Pan Xulun, Lu Feibohong, Zheng Xiaofang, Yang Xingfo, Shou Jingwei, Xu Yongzuo, Zhao Jinqing, Zou Bingwen, Zhu Chengzhang, Zhang Xianglin, Qing Songmao, Pan Yangyao, Ye Huijun, Wu Yun Chu, Liu Congqiang, Sun Ruihuang, Chen Zhiying, Shen Junyi, Wang Taijing, Zhang Zemin, Chen Canglai, and more than one hundred and forty people.</p>
<p>Guests Attending: Dr. Dale Ren, professor of economics at Yenching University, was previously entrusted by the International Industrial and Commercial Management Association to contact Minister Kong to establish a similar organization in China for cooperation. Minister Kong considered this matter to be of great importance and approved it. Mr. Dale is very knowledgeable on management issues and is enthusiastic about this matter, so he came to Shanghai to participate in the opening ceremony of the association.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony: The chairman of the meeting was originally the Minister of Industry and Commerce, Kong Xiangxi, but Minister Kong was slightly late due to important official business, so Vice Minister Mu Ouchu served as the chairman of the meeting. After the formalities, the chairman delivered the opening speech, followed by the preparatory committee reporting on the preparation process (reported by Mu Ouchu, the content of which was seen in yesterday's newspaper, so it is omitted). Then, the constitution, totaling fifteen articles, was discussed. After each article was passed, fifteen directors were elected. After that, proposals were made. All proposals received were divided into two categories: A, those related to the organization of the association, totaling three items; and B, those related to the association's business, totaling twelve items. It was decided to hand them over to the board of directors for consideration. Finally, photos were taken and the meeting adjourned at about 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Opening Speech: The Minister of Industry and Commerce, Kong Xiangxi, attended and delivered a speech, the text of which is as follows: "Since the association was initiated on May 26th, it has been more than a month. I am deeply grateful for the enthusiastic support of the industrial and commercial leaders and the careful planning and smooth progress of the preparatory personnel. Today, I am also honored to have comrades from all walks of life gathered here to contribute their efforts, which is especially gratifying. China's industrial and commercial enterprises have been lagging behind for a long time, and it is imperative to reverse and remedy this situation. However, the national economy is deeply ill, and it is not easy to diagnose and prescribe medicine, and it is even more difficult to restore vitality overnight. If we want to fundamentally reorganize and plan the economy as a whole, we must take the rationalization of economic facilities and the scientific management of industrial and commercial enterprises as the first priority. The establishment of this association is based on the research of scientific management methods, increasing production efficiency, and realizing the people's livelihood. The scope of the business is to collect research materials on scientific management and industrial rationalization issues, discuss and publish, and implement methods to improve industrial and commercial management. Therefore, the guiding principles of this association should pay attention to the following three points: (1) Improving personnel administration to enhance the service ethics and cooperative spirit of managers and those being managed. The philosophers of the past said, 'Being willing to think for others is the highest level of learning.' It is hoped that both labor and management will treat each other with forgiveness, and that talent selection will be based on fairness, so that capital coordination can be fully realized and personnel administration can be thoroughly reformed. (2) Improving production technology to eliminate various wastes. The production efficiency of China's industrial and commercial enterprises is generally very low. The reasons for this are the lack of technological progress and various wastes in transportation and sales. Chinese entrepreneurs should deeply seek the root causes of these problems and find ways to remedy them. What should be noted is that it is not permissible to conceal the disease and avoid treatment, nor is it permissible to use medicine indiscriminately, nor is it permissible to seek wormwood after seven years of illness. This is what I deeply hope for from Chinese entrepreneurs and industrial and commercial management and technical experts. (3) Developing domestic industries to increase public welfare. There is no need to hide the many difficulties in China's economic construction. However, only with sharp tools can we separate entangled roots and knots. If those engaged in industry and commerce can base themselves on the new spirit of serving society and take the revitalization of domestic industries and the consolidation of the economic foundation as a consistent goal, then sincerity will open the golden stone, and there will be no lack of methods to eliminate and overcome all kinds of difficulties in construction. This is what the government and the industrial sector should work together to achieve. The above three points are the mission of this association and are related to the future of China's economic development. Therefore, I would like to discuss them with comrades in the business community and teach them deeply." Kong Xiangxi</p>

<h3>French Business</h3>
<p>Tram Keys Were Robbed</p>
<p>Three People Arrested One After Another</p>
<p>At about 10:30 yesterday morning, a number of people resembling workers simultaneously seized the tram keys from the drivers on trams in the Chinese and French Concessions, causing many trams to stop immediately. However, the police and the Public Security Bureau quickly contained the situation and arrested three people on the spot. The situation was fully restored by 12:00 noon. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Number of People Poured Out and Snatched Keys: At about 10:30 yesterday morning, a French Business Route 6 tram traveling from Xieqiao to Shiliupu was traveling north and south through Fangbang Bridge Station. The driver was stopping the tram to allow passengers to board and alight when a number of people resembling workers poured out of the tram and held the driver down.</p>
<p>One person then snatched the tram key and left. Seeing the fierce situation and being outnumbered, the driver did not dare to speak out and stood still at the front of the tram like a wooden chicken for several minutes.</p>
<p>One Person Arrested by Police Officer: Xu Gongkai, the police officer No. 5 of the 2nd District General Administration of the Public Security Bureau, was standing there directing traffic with a baton when he saw the tram stopped for a long time. Suspecting that the tram had been damaged, he went forward to inquire and understood the situation. As he was about to return to the bureau to report, he saw a person passing by with a key in his hand. Officer Xu immediately arrested him and took him to the general administration.</p>
<p>Many Key-Snatchers Escaped: While Officer Xu was taking the arrested person to the bureau, French Business Route 6 tram No. 32 traveling from north to south arrived at Baiyun Temple, and Route 20 traveling from south to north near Jingjiang Guild Hall were also robbed of their keys in the same way. Although the drivers called for help, they all escaped without a trace. At that time, the ticket buyers and drivers rushed to inform the nearby police officers and reported to the 2nd District General Administration.</p>
<p>Order at All Stations in Chaos: While District Chief Wang was verifying the situation, he received a call from Chief Qian of the 1st Branch of the 2nd District, stating that French Business Route 3 tram No. 4, No. 36, and No. 39 traveling from north to south arrived at Xiaobeimen Station, Route 5 tram No. 14 traveling from north to south arrived at Ximen Station, and Route 6 tram No. 19 and No. 2 traveling from north to south arrived at Fangbang Bridge Station were all robbed of their keys from the drivers in the same way by people resembling workers. At the same time, French Business Route 2 tram No. 25 traveling from south to north arrived at Xinkaihe Station, and Route 2 tram No. 105 traveling from Xujiahui to Shiliupu arrived at Betang Road Station, Route 1 tram No. 7 at Hualong Road Station, Route 5 tram No. 6 at Xixin Bridge Station, Route 6 tram No. 21 at Xiaobeimen Station, and Route 2 trams No. 104 and No. 118 were also robbed. The order at all stations was in chaos, and onlookers blocked the way.</p>
<p>French Concession Police Sent Police to Protect: At that time, the French Concession Police and the 2nd District General Administration and the 1st Branch of the 2nd District of the Public Security Bureau each sent armed police officers to suppress the situation and notified the tram company to first send workers to take the keys and drive the trams back to the Lujiawan parking lot, and then send plainclothes police officers to protect the trams. The situation was fully restored by 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>Three People Arrested and Interrogated Separately: It is heard that when the French Concession Police heard the news, they immediately sent detectives to arrest two people near Shanzhong Road and Yaozhu Cathedral and took them to the police station. After a brief interrogation by the police chief, they confessed that one was Zhou Aliu and the other was Liu Linsheng. One person arrested by the 2nd District General Administration confessed that his name was Song Youxin. District Chief Wang immediately interrogated him and submitted a document to the judicial department for review.</p>

<h3>Mongolian Representatives Departed for Liaoning Yesterday</h3>
<p>A group of more than fifty representatives of various leagues and banners of Mongolia traveled to Hangzhou for sightseeing before returning to Shanghai. After a short rest, they took the Dalian Maru to Liaoning yesterday morning to return to their respective places. There were many people who went to the Huangpu Wharf yesterday morning to see them off.</p>
<h3>Record of Current Personal Activities</h3>
<p>Li Shizeng and Zhang Jingjiang were originally scheduled to leave Beijing for Shanghai the night before last, but were unable to do so due to important official business. They changed to the overnight express train last night and are expected to arrive this morning.</p>
<p>Mu Ouchu and Yang Xingfo took the Beijing-Shanghai overnight express train last night to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Financial and Foreign Affairs Offices Delayed Withdrawal</h3>
<p>The National Government had previously ordered the withdrawal of the offices of various ministries in Shanghai to save public funds and have them handled directly by the ministries. Those that had been merged in accordance with the order included the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines, which were changed to the Minister's Office. As for the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance, due to the need to raise military funds during this military period and to handle other matters, it was convenient to have it located in Shanghai. A request has been submitted to the National Government to allow it to delay its withdrawal. The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is even more important, as various negotiations are now being conveyed through the Shanghai Office, and the embassies of various countries are now preparing to move south and need to be contacted in advance. It is heard that Minister Wang has submitted a request to the National Government to allow it to delay its withdrawal.</p>
<p>Due Recognition and Efforts for the Establishment of the National Government (1) The organization of the National Government was resolved at the First National Congress of our party. At that time, the President also attended and explained the importance of this case. After the death of the President, it was resolved by the Central Political Committee on July 1, 1925, to formally announce its establishment as the political center to drive the progress and completion of the National Revolution.</p>
<p>(2) Since its establishment, the National Government has been in the midst of active and passive sabotage and shaking by counter-revolutionary forces. It has made great progress in struggle and its foundation has become increasingly consolidated. In the past five years, it has successively eliminated the deeply rooted northern and southern warlords and the communist bandits who killed and set fires, so that the preliminary work of the National Revolution could be completed and the construction of the revolution is progressing day by day.</p>
<p>(3) The permanent foundation of the National Government must be built on the will and ability of the people of the whole country to exercise political power, and the will and ability to exercise political power cannot be effective without political training. Therefore, to commemorate the establishment of the National Government, we must earnestly implement political tutelage, build local autonomy, and train the people to exercise political power.</p>
<p>(4) The prerequisite for the National Government to implement political tutelage is the real unity and peace of the whole country. Therefore, to commemorate the establishment of the National Government, we must support the central government and thoroughly eliminate the Feng and Ge traitors who are destroying unity in order to lay the foundation for the National Government to implement construction work.</p>

<h3>City Propaganda Department</h3>
<p>Expanding Cooperation Movement Propaganda</p>
<p>Ordering All Districts to Actively Prepare</p>
<p>The City Party Headquarters Propaganda Department convened the ninth city propaganda meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Chen Dezheng, Bao Rong, Xu Xingchu, and other committee members from each district, including Zhu Shujian, Huang Xianggu, Shen Risheng, Shen Yu, Wu Xikuan, and more than ten others, attended. Department Head Chen De presided over the meeting, and after formal greetings, the chairman's report stated, in brief, that the military situation was optimistic recently. The central army had won a major victory on the Longhai Line, and the rumors spread by external reactionaries had been proven to be false. It was said that Western newspapers were promoting a peace movement, saying that the central government would compromise with a certain party to resolve a certain matter. It should be understood that such rumors are not credible. The central government will never compromise with rebellious party warlords and politicians who harm the country. The central government has ample resources to eliminate all reactionaries. From a strategic perspective, the central government has adopted an offensive posture, while the enemy has adopted a defensive posture. The forces of Yan and Feng are about to collapse. Zhang Xueliang has assumed the position of deputy commander of the sea, land, and air forces and is determined to send troops to suppress the rebels. The end of Yan and Feng is imminent. While entrusting the suppression work to armed comrades, the Party is still making every effort to carry out Party affairs and political work in the rear. Recently, it has issued a circular to all provinces and cities across the country to hold Cooperation Movement Promotion Week uniformly. This city is actively preparing, and the method of how to carry out the promotion of the cooperation movement must be discussed today and tomorrow. Subsequently, Xu Xingchu, the chief secretary of the Guidance Section, reported that the weather was hot today, and the work in each district seemed to be lax, which needed to be revitalized. All the plans for the Cooperation Movement Promotion Week in this city have been drawn up. It must be understood that the benefits of the Cooperation Movement, generally speaking, can eliminate all kinds of cumbersome procedures and deduction. At a time when people's livelihood is declining and everything is expensive, it is even more necessary to promote it. A large-scale promotion of the cooperation movement was held last year, and the results were good, but there were also many shortcomings, such as the number of audience members before and after was less than 200, the upper-level party headquarters carried out the work very well, but the lower-level party headquarters slackened off. Therefore, in this Cooperation Movement promotion plan, the upper-level party headquarters will do more guiding, such as the promotion conference, academic lectures, etc. The rest of the work is assigned to the promotion schedule of each district. It has been stipulated that the lectures or entertainment events in each district will be jointly led by the district party headquarters and the municipal committee members. It is hoped that they will fully accomplish this important task. Secondly, this city plans to organize a drama review committee. The regulations are being drafted, and they will be implemented as soon as they are approved by the city executive committee. Subsequently, the committee members from each district reported successively, and the discussion began: (1) How should each district assist in carrying out the Cooperation Movement Promotion Week to be held in this city? (Resolution) (1) The party headquarters in each district shall convene an emergency propaganda meeting within five days to discuss and comply with the implementation measures and request the city propaganda department to send personnel to guide it. (2) Request the city propaganda department to stipulate that the topics of the lectures in the branch offices of each district within the recent two weeks should focus on the material of the Cooperation Movement. (3) Each district should organize consumer cooperatives as much as possible. (4) The publications in each district should add a special issue on the Cooperation Movement. (5) The detailed measures will be drawn up by the city propaganda department and then circulated to the party headquarters in each district for compliance. (6) It is suggested that the city propaganda department convene the persons in charge of each cooperative in this city and those with experience in the cooperation movement to discuss the difficulties of the cooperatives and their solutions. (Re-determine the meeting time of this meeting. (Resolution) 2:00 PM every week. (3) Whether or not to organize credit cooperatives in this city.

<h3>Waiving Inspection of Books on Labor from the International Labor Office</h3>
<p>The First Batch Has Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>The International Labor Office in Geneva has packed two large boxes of books for reference on labor issues and transported them to the Exchange Branch for storage. Chen Zongcheng learned about this in advance and stated that books for reference on labor issues are sometimes sent to Shanghai. According to the provisions of the Peace Treaty, customs offices at the port of departure and arrival should waive inspection and release these books, provided that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the destination country notifies the customs office in advance to follow suit. He sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct the customs office to be notified. When the first batch of two large boxes of books arrived in Shanghai the other day, Chen Shiguang, the director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, fearing that the customs office had not received the notice due to the short notice, sent a special letter to the Tax Affairs Department to waive inspection and release the books.

In the future, all such books transported to Shanghai will be exempt from inspection.</p>

<h3>Home Ruined and Family Destroyed</h3>
<p>Young Man Attempts Suicide in Huangpu River</p>
<p>Wife No Longer to Be Seen</p>
<p>Travel Expenses Have Been Exhausted</p>
<p>Interest in Life Almost Gone</p>
<p>At 9:00 PM the other night, a young man at the Yangjingbang Wharf suddenly jumped into the Huangpu River to commit suicide when no one was prepared. Fortunately, Chinese Constable No. 11 of the Water Patrol Station saw him and immediately tried to rescue him, bringing him back to life. He was taken to the police station for questioning. He stated that his name was Yang Jinlin, 23 years old, from Songjiang. His parents had passed away, and he had been married to his wife, Gu, for five years. They had one son and one daughter, the daughter being four years old and the son being two years old. Because his family was extremely poor, he rented 15 mu of land in his hometown, and the couple farmed to make a living. Last year, the landlord took back the land, and he had no way to make a living. Therefore, he asked someone to introduce his wife to Shanghai this spring to work as a domestic helper. At that time, the children were all taken away by his wife. Unexpectedly, for several months, his wife had no news and did not return home. Recently, he came to Shanghai alone to look for her, and after exhausting all his efforts, he only found his wife's younger brother, Gu Botian. Gu worked as a teahouse boy in the Hongqiao Pharmaceutical Office in the city. Gu told him that life was difficult now, and it was difficult to support his wife and children, so he wanted to divorce him. He was horrified to hear this and demanded to see his wife, threatening him in every possible way, but he still refused to let the couple meet. He also heard that his son had been sold, and his daughter was being raised in his mother-in-law's home. He was alone in Shanghai, with no one to help him. Thinking that life had become a picture of a ruined home and a destroyed family, he became depressed and ill, and his travel expenses were exhausted. Therefore, he had the thought of ending his life. When he said this, he sobbed incessantly. The police chief verified the confession and ordered the detectives to send him to the District Court for relief yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Seventeen Years of Marriage</h3>
<p>Divorce Lawsuit Filed</p>
<p>Husband Has Changed in the Past Five Years</p>
<p>Beats Her After Heavy Drinking</p>
<p>Judge's Good Intentions Cannot Reconcile Them</p>
<p>Wife Says She Cannot Endure the Suffering</p>
<p>Fan Fei, a woman from Chongming, is 33 years old. She married Fan Shengchu, a fellow villager, in the second year of the Republic of China and had a son named Amao, who is 13 years old. They were initially harmonious, but recently Shengchu suddenly changed his behavior, indulging in heavy drinking and beating her whenever he was drunk. She could not bear the abuse and has now hired attorney Gu Jihong to file a divorce lawsuit with the District Court. The grounds for her lawsuit are that all the household utensils have been sold by the defendant, and the house has been transferred to others. The defendant lives in an inn, so the plaintiff has no home to return to and can only make a living by working as a laborer. Life is becoming increasingly difficult. In the long run, the name of husband and wife exists in name only, and the means of making a living have been cut off. The defendant's intention to abandon her is obvious. Therefore, she requests a divorce. Judge Zhao Zhenhai held a court hearing yesterday to hear the case. The plaintiff, Fan Fei, described the previous situation and said that she is now a cigarette wrapper worker. (Question) Do you want a divorce? (Answer) Yes. (Question) When did you get married? (Answer) I got married when I was 16 years old. (Question) Have you and your husband always been good? (Answer) We used to be good, but in the last five years, the defendant has changed his mind, making friends indiscriminately outside, indulging in smoking and drinking, and causing trouble when he is drunk. So, every night before going to bed, I prepare a pot of strong tea for the defendant to quench his thirst when he comes home late at night. Once, because I was tired from working during the day, I fell asleep and forgot to make tea. The defendant beat and insulted me. Usually, the defendant would go to the restaurant to eat his fill when he had money, ignoring the fact that there was little food and clothing at home. I have no choice but to come to the court to request a divorce, etc. The defendant, Fan Shengchu, 35 years old, from Chongming, currently works as a docker for a living. The plaintiff has been married to me for 17 years and has already given birth to a son. She is good. (Question) Since she is good, why does she want a divorce? (Answer) She says I smoke and drink. I do drink, but only 150 cash per meal, three meals a day. The judge said, now let's reconcile. You drink less, and you must not abuse the plaintiff in the future. The plaintiff replied after hearing the judge's words, I really can't endure the suffering and would rather work for myself. The judge repeatedly tried to persuade her, but the plaintiff insisted on a divorce. Therefore, the reconciliation failed, and prosecutor Yang Wenjun was invited to the court to express his opinion, saying that the plaintiff's lawsuit had no sufficient grounds and should be rejected. After receiving all the plaintiff's attorney's statements, the judge ordered the debate to be concluded and scheduled the verdict for the 30th (today).</p>

<h3>Datong Music Society Gains New Talents</h3>
<p>A Large Number of Ancient Trees Discovered in Nanjing</p>
<p>Transported to Shanghai to Make Ancient and Modern Musical Instruments</p>
<p>The Datong Music Society has been established for ten years and has found that there are still more than 160 kinds of musical instruments that can be imitated today. The society has manufactured 80 kinds over the years, and half of them are suffering from a lack of suitable materials. In recent months, 170 ancient trees were suddenly discovered in a pond in the inner city of Nanjing. They are definitely from the Southern Song Dynasty and have been in the earth for 800 years. The wood is dry and all the dry air has been removed. Making musical instruments with them will have precious value and be treasures of the world's music community. Domestically, they can leave a name for future generations, and externally, they can connect the world's culture. The Ministry of Education has ordered Wei Juxian, the director of the Antiquities Preservation Institute, to issue 2,208 feet (about 100 trees) to the society, as requested by the society. The society has sent the director Zheng Yusun to collect them. About 40 trees (about 600 feet) have been collected and transferred to the transportation company for transport to Shanghai. The rest still need to be collected. However, the manufacturing, labor, and accessories require a lot of expenses. The society's economy is inherently poor. It is heard that famous figures such as Li and Cai are trying to raise funds or hold large-scale concerts to raise funds.</p>
<h3>Fewer Crimes Last Week</h3>

<p>Opening for Treatment on July 5th</p>
<p>No Fees Charged</p>

The number of outpatients reaches more than 300 every day, and there is a shortage of beds for inpatients. It has specially increased the outpatient hours from the 16th of this month. However, the weather has been hot recently, and there have been outbreaks of epidemics. In view of this, the hospital has specially established an epidemic department at the old site of the former City Student Federation on Shangwen Road in Nanshi.

<h3>Applying for</h3>
<p>Method for Obtaining Self-Defense Firearm Licenses</p>
<p>Petitioning Police Officers Limited to Half a Month to Report for Inspection</p>
<p>Self-Defense Firearms Limited to One Month to Obtain Licenses</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau instructed all districts to follow the order. According to the order of the Municipal Government, the office in charge of inspecting and issuing licenses for self-defense firearms has submitted a report stating that the office has been ordered to handle the inspection of self-defense firearms. The opening date and application procedures have been reported and notified in newspapers. However, the time has passed for several months, and the number of people who have come to report for inspection and obtain licenses is still very small. Shanghai is a city where merchants gather and factories are numerous, and there must be many people who own self-defense firearms. According to the investigation, the number of petitioning police officers in each district ranges from more than 100 to more than a dozen. These petitioning police officers are all hired by the petitioning police officers at their own expense. The firearms are purely for self-defense and are different from the weapons of regular police officers. According to Article 1 of the Provisional Regulations for Inspecting Self-Defense Firearms and Issuing Licenses by the Revised National Government, licenses should be applied for without any doubt. It is proposed to instruct the Public Security Bureau to instruct the district offices to instruct each petitioner to make slight changes to the firearms within half a month of receiving the order to avoid sending them directly to the office.</p>
<p>Instead, the firearms should be reported and obtained through the district office in charge to facilitate the process. In addition, those who have self-defense firearms but have not yet obtained licenses should also be ordered by the Public Security Bureau to notify them to come to the office to obtain licenses within one month. If there is any violation or violation of the provisions of Articles 19 to 23 of the regulations, the bureau should order its subordinates to investigate and deal with them at any time to enforce the law and suppress private possession. If this is appropriate, a report will be submitted for your review. Accordingly, the office's report is not inappropriate and should be approved. The office should be instructed to issue the 30 copies of the regulations to each district office for compliance.</p>

<h3>Utilizing Paper Mill Products</h3>
<p>Exemption from Tax for Transport to Foreign Countries</p>
<p>Chen Xuyuan, the representative of Liyong Paper Manufacturing Co., Ltd., previously submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance stating that the paper products produced by the company are purely machine-made Western-style goods.

<h3>German Consul's Beloved Cat Missing</h3>
<p>Cherished Like Children</p>
<p>Greatly Distressed by the Loss</p>
<p>The German Consulate in Shanghai, located on the Suzhou Creek near the Baidu (Garden) Bridge, has always kept a cat. It is about two feet long, quite large, with pure white fur three inches long. Its green eyes are distinctly different from those of ordinary cats, and they are bright as lightning. It is a special product of a certain country and is deeply loved by its owners (i.e., the consul and his wife), who treat it no less than their own children and hire a dedicated person to care for it. However, at 7:00 PM the night before, the cat suddenly went missing. The consul and his wife were extremely distressed. They reported the matter to the River Police, who dispatched detective Huang Songsheng to investigate. According to the consul's wife, the beloved cat never ventures far. It probably went to play on the Bund in the backyard and was taken away by boatmen. Whoever finds the cat, regardless of who they are, they are willing to offer a large reward. The detective, hearing this, returned to report.</p>
<h3>National Photography Exhibition Closed Last Night</h3>

<h3>Improvements to the City Police Bureau Detention Center</h3>
<p>Yuan, the Director of the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau, has shown more consideration for the detainees in the detention center. Because the price of rice has risen, the rations are insufficient. He has submitted a request to Mayor Zhang, which has been approved, to add five cents per person per day and add a breakfast meal. Now that the hot summer has arrived and the weather is extremely hot, most prisoners are crowded into one room, making the heat unbearable. Special funds have been allocated to hire craftsmen to build reed awnings to prevent prisoners from suffering from the extreme heat. A letter has also been sent to the Health Bureau requesting the assignment of a doctor to be stationed in the bureau on a regular basis. Every prisoner entering the center must first be vaccinated to prevent epidemics. Yesterday, the director of the detention center was also instructed to provide more tea for hydration.</p>
<h3>Jingcheng Paper Company Sued</h3>
<p>The Jingcheng Paper Company, located at 1171 North Chengdu Road, has been established for many years. Its general manager is Wang Shuxian. In order to promote business but lacking capital, the company issued bonds in the name of the company on September 1, 1927, named Jingcheng Paper Co., Ltd. Industry Bonds, with a fixed national currency of 200,000 yuan. The face value of the bonds was divided into four types: A, B, C, and D. Type A was 500 yuan per bond, Type B was 100 yuan, Type C was 50 yuan, and Type D was 10 yuan. The bonds stated that the company's assets would be used as collateral, and interest would be paid annually at 1%. Bondholders also had the right to receive 20% of the company's dividends first. The principal would be repaid by drawing lots once a year starting one year after the date of issuance, with 50,000 yuan repaid each time to be cleared in four years. Outsiders did not feel there would be any harm to this method. Those with the ambition to revitalize industry and promote national goods were willing to invest. Liu Ziwei, the grandson of Liu Kunyi, the former Governor-General of Liangjiang, thought the method was appropriate, so on January 1 of the following year, he purchased 16 Type A bonds for 8,000 yuan and 100 Type B bonds for 10,000 yuan from Wang Shuxian, the general manager of the company. But until now, he had only received the official interest issued in January 1929 and nothing else. The so-called drawing of lots once a year has already passed two draw periods since he held the bonds, but it has never been held. Liu repeatedly negotiated with the company, blaming it for violating the regulations and losing credibility, but to no avail. Recently, he heard that Wang Shuxian had mortgaged Jingcheng's assets to others for a large sum of money. If this is true, the rights of bondholders will be even less guaranteed. So, he hired lawyer Yang Guoshu to file a lawsuit with the Special District Local Court, requesting that Wang Shuxian be summoned to court to order the fulfillment of the bond conditions, repayment of the principal and interest due of 10,800 yuan, and to bear all litigation costs. In addition, the entire property of the Jingcheng Company should be provisionally attached to protect the bond rights. The trial was held by Judge Xu Wenrong the morning before yesterday. The defendant did not appear and hired lawyer Lin Yingqing as his representative. First, lawyer Yang stated the case and said that in recent years, due to the high price of gold and the cheap price of silver, very little foreign paper had been imported and the price had doubled. The defendant, Jingcheng Company, was taking advantage of this opportunity to promote business, so its livelihood was now extremely developed and it could earn more than 200,000 yuan a year. But the defendant transferred the profits earned by the company to other uses.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>(Shen Bao, Fourth Sheet)</p>
<p>Instead of paying attention to the proper bonds that should be repaid with principal and interest, it turned a blind eye, willingly losing its good credit and creating an unfavorable impression on profitable industries. It is a pity. Judge Xu then advised both parties to go outside and try to reconcile. The case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Mediation in Zhu Jixing Case</h3>
<p>Hope for Peaceful Resolution</p>
<p>Zhu Jixing, the deputy compradore of the British-owned Jardine Matheson Bank, embezzled 160,000 yuan from the bank. However, since Zhu was arrested by the police, a prominent figure in the business community has come forward to mediate, asking Zhu to repay the embezzled money so that a peaceful resolution can be reached.

<h3>Judgment in Bad Check Fraud Case</h3>
<p>Qingtai Money Shop in Longqing Lane, Beijing Road, closed down on the 4th of this month. The owner of the shop, Zhang Jiyuan, a native of Shaoxing, also fled without a trace. Before that, he used bad checks to defraud various households, including Qinfuchang on Nanjing Road, Ningbowen Kuang on Ningbo Road, and Dong Jingbo on Jiangxi Road, for a total of more than 1,600 taels. Recently, the General Patrol Room discovered the accounts and accountants Mian Maofang and Wang Jisheng, etc., and Wang Jisheng's father, Wang Xutang, was also detained. They were escorted to the Special District Local Court for questioning on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. According to the lawyer of the patrol room, it was found that Zhang Jiyuan had previously opened a store on Nanjing Road and had also fled with bad checks. He was simply engaged in fraud. It should be strictly investigated. When questioned, Zhang confessed that the check was paid by Wang Xutang and denied that he was the owner of Qingtai Shop. Bao's testimony was also very ambiguous. Wang Jisheng completely denied any relationship with the case. Wang Xutang only admitted that he had contacted the shop on behalf of Wang Renji Cosmetics Store, a neighbor.

There was no escape. The court ordered that the hearing be continued after the plaintiff arrived in court.</p>
<h3>Judgment in Ge Luo Divorce Case</h3>
<p>Ge Yufu, who lives on Penglai Road, Laoximen, recently sued his wife Luo Mingjun in the local court for anonymous love letters and for believing that his wife conceived on the night he had sex with his wife, should have been in July last year, and this April his wife gave birth, believing that it was not his seed, and demanded a divorce. Luo Mingjun then filed a counterclaim, saying that Ge had the intention of abandoning her and requested cohabitation and support, and claimed that the anonymous love letter was fabricated by the plaintiff, and that a September pregnancy could also be born. After repeated investigations by the court Zhang Chishiwu, it was found that Ge Yufu's lawsuit was unfounded and Luo Mingjun's reasons were naturally sufficient. Both husband and wife have the obligation to cohabit and the husband has the obligation to support his wife. Therefore, yesterday the judgment was announced and the main text was as follows: Ge Yufu's lawsuit was rejected. Ge Yufu should cohabit with Luo Mingjun and bear the support costs.

But the woman was still unsatisfied and asked someone to draft a statement and filed a lawsuit for separation with the local court. Judge Wang Qufei held a hearing yesterday. The plaintiff Zhao Ge made a statement and demanded separation. Zhao Xingzhai, the defendant, confessed that after the plaintiff ran away in 1923, she had an affair with a man named Li (from Zhenjiang) and rented a house in Lan Nidu, Pudong. On September 13 of last year, Li's legal wife came to Shen. The plaintiff fought with her for favor and cut her throat with a knife. She was once involved in litigation at the Third District Police Station. The plaintiff actually called herself Li Ge. It is fine to ask the judge to investigate and said that she has filed a divorce suit with the Civil Court.

But Luo and his sister-in-law continued to be in secret contact more than once. Yesterday afternoon, Luo made an excuse to go out, and Shen found out and secretly followed her husband. He saw him holding hands with his sister-in-law and entering a hotel near the North Railway Station. Shen invited six or seven colleagues to rush to the hotel and capture the men and women together. Luo and his sister-in-law were not ashamed and returned to the store together. Shen was jealous and hit her husband's chest with her head, saying that she would die together today. She also held a linen rope and intended to hang herself. Later, Bingchen's mother beat him with a stick because her son was indeed wrong, which relieved her daughter-in-law's hatred. Who knew that Shen was determined to die.

<h3>Poor Woman Stabbed by Thugs</h3>
<p>The Inside Story is Unexplainable</p>
<p>Yang Mao, a woman from Taizhou, 49 years old, lives in a thatched shed in the Tianjian field at the east end of the Tianzhutang Street in Qichangzhan, Pudong. Her husband, Yang, returned to Taiwan a few days ago. There are only Mao and her 18-year-old daughter and 8-9-year-old son at home. The area is the intersection of the Third District and the Second Branch of the Third District. It is very desolate and there is no one for one or two miles around. Mao's house is like an isolated island at sea, but the family is very poor and sometimes they do not even have enough to eat. Their poverty is worse than that of beggars, so no villains have evil intentions towards them. But something unexpected happened. At nearly 1:00 AM yesterday morning, three burly men with sharp knives broke into their house. Mao was awakened from her sleep. The people did not ask the reason and immediately raised their knives and stabbed Mao's left cheek near her mouth ten times, and also stabbed her right leg once. After the incident, they rushed to escape through the door. Mao fell to the ground and bled like a fountain, unable to speak. Her daughter immediately reported to the Qichangzhan Third District Police Station. The section chief Shen went to the scene of the incident to investigate. After the investigation, because Mao was old and ugly, there was no fighting over jealousy, and her daughter was also in her youth, but her appearance was ugly, similar to her mother, and it was not similar to the above-mentioned incident. The case was bizarre and was considered worthy of study. Seeing that Mao's injuries were severe and she could not speak, it was even more difficult to find clues. So, after dawn, he ordered someone to take her to Shanghai Hospital for treatment and reported to the Third District to arrest the murderer.</p>
<h3>Soldier Hangs Himself Due to Despair and is Rescued</h3>

They hung themselves on the corner of a low wall with leggings. Fortunately, Jin Yu, a guard from the Gaochangmiao Police Station in the Second District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, saw them and went forward to rescue them. Fortunately, they had not lost their breath and were still alive. The police officer took the district to the police station. According to the confession of Liu Yunxin, a native of Jiangxi, 27 years old, after serving as a soldier in a certain division, he stayed in Shanghai after being discharged from the army.

<h3>Russian Man Driving a Car Kills a Man</h3>
<p>Debate Concludes, Awaiting Verdict</p>
<p>The Russian man Maisgelangge (transliteration), who works as a bodyguard for the Westerner Ai Pixi of the Asia Petroleum Company, was drunk on the evening of the 8th of this month and drove a car to the entrance of the Enpaiya Cinema on Xiafei Road, French Concession. The driver accidentally went the wrong way, causing Gong, the third widow of Qu Guisheng, the owner of the Shengji Bicycle Shop on Aber Road, Pudong, to be killed by the rickshaw she was sitting in. The case was reviewed by the French Court and ordered to conduct an on-site inspection to clarify the situation and then review the case, which has been reported in the past. The patrol room summoned both parties to the French Court again the day before yesterday for further interrogation. Yao Zhaodi, the representative of the plaintiff, stated that it was found that the defendant caused the disaster that evening because he first went to a bar on Xiafei Road and got drunk. Then he drove the car to the corner of Xiafei Road and Maigaobaolu Road. The defendant suddenly took the wrong path and crashed the rickshaw. The patrol room has now confirmed that there is a report that can prove that the defendant was at fault. It is known that according to the regulations of the patrol room, anyone who is drunk is not allowed to drive a car. Now the defendant is driving after drinking and violating the driving regulations. He is guilty of intentional homicide and should be prosecuted. In addition, he is allowed to reserve the right to private civil action. The defendant was represented by lawyer Pulaimei, claiming that the accident was caused by the rickshaw not having lights. Although the defendant drank in the cafe, he was not drunk. I don’t know who is at fault in this matter. Please investigate. The Chinese and Western officials announced the end of the debate and waited for a review.</p>
<h3>Accused of Illegally Collecting Rent and Tips</h3>
<p>Shi Jiqing hired a lawyer to represent him and filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the French Court, stating that the plaintiff rented a house in Tongde Lane, Zilai Street, from Yuan Ziheng a few years ago. It was stated that the monthly rent was 250 taels and a tip of 1,800 taels was paid. At that time, the plaintiff thought that the defendant was a formal agent until now, he learned that the defendant was pretending to be an manager. It was found that the formal agency of the house belonged to lawyer Tibeck. Now a letter from lawyer Ti can prove it. It is known that the defendant took extra rent and collected tips privately and violated the criminal law of the National Government and violated the regulations of the French Consul General. The defendant is guilty of fraud and should be investigated, and the tips and 1,000 taels of rent paid for 20 months should be recovered. The defendant was represented by lawyer Bahe, claiming everything and stating that the plaintiff had made all the evidence. The lawyer has not read it yet. Please allow an adjournment for review. Judge Zhu approved a change of date for the review.</p>
<h3>Those Who Mix Feces with Water are Detained</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Works Bureau built a manure wharf on the Dama Wharf in the South City, the manure workers from various districts clean up the houses every morning and transport the manure to the wharf, where the manure is poured into the ships moored there for transshipment to other places. The manure workers are greedy for profit, so they often use clear water to fill the manure carts and then use bamboo poles to mix it with the manure to make it thinner for profit. As a result, the stench spreads everywhere. The area is a prosperous location and people going to and from the wharf in the morning are very crowded and dislike this behavior. This seriously hinders public health in the summer heat. Businessmen in the area have jointly petitioned the authorities to take strict measures to prohibit it. Unexpectedly, the police officer guarding the third post in the area noticed a manure worker tamping manure on the shore the day before yesterday morning. When he went forward to stop him, the manure worker not only refused to obey but dared to speak disrespectfully. He was immediately taken to the First District General Office under his jurisdiction and ordered to be detained for pre-trial review.</p>

The person looked flustered and the circumstances were suspicious. The patrol officer went forward to inquire and said that his name was Fang Xitang, 26 years old, from Shaoxing. The soybean oil was brought to Shanghai by his uncle from Haizhou and was intended to be sent to Yuanfang Road, etc. When asked if he had any evidence and his uncle's name, he could not answer. He was immediately taken to the office. After questioning by Director Yao, it was clear that the origin of the oil was unknown. He ordered him to be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Record of the Jiangsu Rice Merchants Association Standing Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Ninghu Municipal and County Rice Industry Association held its ninth standing committee meeting yesterday at Cuixiu Hall. The attending committee members included Chen Junyu and Zhu Zixiang, totaling twenty-two individuals. Zhu Zixiang was publicly elected as chairman, and the meeting proceeded with the usual formalities. Subsequently, a proposal was made regarding the Bureau of Social Affairs' approval of the dredging donation, which the Bureau of Finance decided to continue collecting and should still be paid. The resolution was that the collection of this item has never had the name of dredging, and the dredging matter should not be the sole responsibility of the rice industry. A request should be submitted to the provincial government to strive for consistency. A proposal was made regarding the three-month tax exemption case. The provincial government instructed that the Department of Finance should be consulted for verification and reply on how to handle the case. The resolution was that with the rising price of rice, the government only forcibly suppresses the price. However, although there are explicit orders to reduce or exempt rice donations, they have not been implemented. Another request should be made to the provincial government to immediately order compliance to relieve merchants' difficulties and stabilize rice prices. The Wujiang Rice Industry Association proposed that rice merchants in the county are often questioned and detained at the 31st bridge on the Shanghai-Hangzhou road when transporting goods to Shanghai. The resolution was to request the Garrison Headquarters to order the troops stationed there not to detain them without reason to maintain the people's food supply. The Wuxi Rice Milling Association proposed that due to the poor harvest last year, there is also concern about the people's food supply in the interior. It is hoped that the circulation of foreign rice can be maintained. Please bring foreign rice to Shanghai,</p>
<p>Temporarily postpone re-export to avoid soaring prices. The resolution was that foreign rice is different from Du rice. Temporarily postponing re-export will only hinder the source of foreign rice. There is no need to discuss it. Committee member Qian Jingsheng sent a letter requesting resignation. The resolution was to send a letter to retain him.</p>
<h3>Rice Regulation Committee Notice: Rice Shops Collect Rice</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Shop Industry Group Regulation Committee issued a notice to all registered rice shops, stating that it was ordered by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to organize a rice evaluation committee with various rice industry groups to fairly evaluate prices. Meanwhile, the existing rice in the riverboats in Zhabei will be collected by the Bean and Rice Industry Association's Zhabei Office and distributed to various rice shops by our committee. Our committee has temporarily set up a temporary sub-office at the original site of Tongxing Rice Shop on the west side of Xinzha Bridge in Zhabei. Hundreds of rice shops have registered to collect rice in the past few days, and the amount of rice collected has also reached a certain amount. It is the season of the plum rain, and the rice collected may be damp. Therefore, it was decided to distribute the currently collected rice fairly according to the registered shops, about ten dan each. We will notify you again when more rice is collected. Please bring the payment to our committee's Zhabei temporary sub-office at 9:00 am on June 30 to pay for the allocated amount. Please collect the rice on time and do not delay.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Collision</h3>
<p>A barge was sunk</p>
<p>The Fengyang Maru, a Yangtze River steamer of the Nisshin Company, was docked at the pier in front of the Japanese Consulate at 4 pm on the 28th to unload cargo. At that time, the Lever Bros. steamer was passing by. The water at the mouth of the Waibaidu Bridge was extremely turbulent. The Lever Bros. steamer could not stop and was driven by the current, crashing into the Fengyang Maru. With a loud noise, a large hole was smashed in the cabin of the Fengyang Maru. A cargo barge docked on the outside was crushed by the Lever Bros. steamer, and five boatmen fell into the water. The cargo carried in the boat, estimated at 200 bags of sorghum, also flowed into the river. For a time, the river surface was in turmoil. The five boatmen who fell into the water were rescued by other barges and water patrol teams. The damaged Fengyang Maru was immediately repaired and can still operate normally for export.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Lakes</h3>
<p>Silk Merchants Petition for Tax Reduction Shanghai News</p>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Government Decides to Reduce by One-Fourth</p>
<p>Latest Electric Silk Fabrics Completely Exempt from Tax</p>
<p>Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province, is famous for its silk production. There are about 4,000 hand-woven silk looms in the whole territory, mostly using iron jacquard looms to weave plain fabrics. Some silk factories use the latest Swiss electric machines. Its special products are Huzhou crepe, Bi crepe, and Hua silk gauze, which are sold at home and abroad every year and are quite developed. Since the Franco-Japanese exclusive treaties, the import taxes levied by various countries have greatly affected overseas trade. In addition, due to the influx of foreign goods, frequent wars, and overlapping taxes, domestic sales have also become increasingly sluggish. As a result, 70-80% of the scattered looms in the suburbs have stopped working, and 50-60% of the silk factories have closed down. Workers are unemployed and bandits are everywhere. Not only is the silk weaving industry in danger of falling into a desperate situation, but also the local security is in a precarious state. Last year, Hubei merchants initiated the Silk Relief Association in Shanghai, advocating domestic production through written publicity. By this year, the situation has become increasingly deteriorated. They are trying to save the situation by appealing to the government to reduce or exempt taxes. They elected Pan Runsheng, manager of Shanghai Tonghe Crepe Shop, and Feng Zuolan, manager of Huzhou Tonghe Crepe Shop, as representatives. The representatives repeatedly submitted letters to the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government, appealing for reduction or exemption of taxes. The main reason is that the tax rates for silk fabrics in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai are the highest in Zhejiang, followed by Jiangsu, and then Shanghai. The tax rates in Zhejiang Province are also inconsistent, and Huzhou silk bears the heaviest burden. For example, Ning satin is 1.4 yuan per catty, Su Fa is 1.7 yuan per catty, Sheng silk is 2.28 yuan per catty, and Dan crepe is only 1 yuan per catty. Moreover, production and sales are taxed, and sales to Shanghai do not require additional tax payment.</p>
<p>The silk fabrics produced in Shanghai are completely tax-free, not only in the concessions but also in the Chinese areas. Even silk factories in Minhang and other places are exempt from taxes by analogy. Hangzhou-Shaoxing silk in Zhejiang Province pays a production tax of 3.8 yuan per catty and a sales tax of 1.2 yuan per catty when transported to Shanghai. Compared with the tax rate of Suzhou silk, it is already a ratio of one to three. Huzhou silk pays a production tax of 5.4 yuan per catty and a sales tax of 1.1 yuan per catty when transported to Shanghai, which is even more onerous. Shanghai is the concentration point of the silk market, and the competitive strength is obviously different. Even if the cost of labor and materials for Huzhou silk is the same as that of Suzhou and Shanghai, the heavy tax burden is enough to hinder competition. How can it not decline? Therefore, it is necessary to appeal for reduction or exemption of tax rates to save the situation. At the same time, Hangzhou and Shaoxing silk merchants also heard the news and actively supported it. The provincial government also deeply understands the suffering of silk merchants in recent years, and the reasons given by the representatives are also valid. Therefore, it was proposed at the 311th provincial affairs meeting to reduce the silk tax in the whole province by one-fourth. Factories that use the latest European and American electric weaving machines and have been inspected and approved by the Construction Department are completely exempt from taxes. The Finance Department will order the collection agencies to implement it uniformly from June 16. The Huzhou merchants' petition for tax reduction has come to an end. It is said that the two representatives, Pan and Feng, are still planning to petition the National Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government to reduce or exempt the sales tax for transportation to Shanghai, so that the silk fabrics produced in Shanghai are in an equal tax-free position. The satisfactory result of this petition for tax reduction is due to the efforts of Pan and Sao.</p>
<h3>Magistrate Yan Shows Compassion for Patrol Police</h3>
<p>Magistrate Yan of Shanghai County, out of compassion for the patrol police who are on duty in the hot weather and are prone to heatstroke, specially prepared 500 bottles of Jizhong water and instructed the County Public Security Bureau to distribute them to each sub-bureau for the patrol police to use.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Shaanxi Relief</h3>
<p>Report from Jisheng Society</p>
<p>Zhang Junxianqing, director of the Shaanxi Relief of the Chinese Jisheng Society, reported from Xi'an yesterday that county magistrates and telegraph bureau staff have left their posts more than 100 li west of Chang'an. Bandits are everywhere, and travel is difficult. Relief to the east of Chang'an to Tongguan is extremely unsafe, and long-distance buses are often robbed. Therefore, the relief workers of our society in Wugong County have suffered great fright. Xianqing escorted cash three times, and the people of Shaanxi Province were wary and earnestly advised him to stop. However, Xianqing believed that disaster relief was as urgent as fire and could not wait long, so he ventured to go. On June 6, the Wugong relief inspection was completed, and all the relief workers returned to the province safely, which was very fortunate. However, the more soldiers and bandits there are, the greater the disaster. In fact, those who go to do relief can only temporarily stop. Those who can be saved must find a way to save their lives in case of emergency, and avoid the crime of seeing death without saving. Therefore, a comprehensive and essential relief method was carefully planned. Two original shelters in Xi'an were merged into one, and the number of places was increased. There is one disaster relief and education center in Xianyang County, one disaster relief and education center in Xingping County, three disaster relief and education centers in Wugong County, one disaster relief and education center in Fufeng County, and one disaster relief and education center in Qishan County. The number of people sheltered ranges from several hundred to more than a thousand. The above six counties have a total of eight shelters, and a large amount of money is still needed every month before the autumn harvest can be cancelled. The society's economy is difficult, and it is urgent to plan for assistance. Once Xianqing's deployment is proper, he will accompany his relief friends around Shanxi to Pingliang and return to Xiaobin for a brief rest to raise funds and explore the news from the western province. If the disaster areas are slightly stable and able to proceed, he will find a way to rescue them again. The current situation is becoming more and more difficult, and the disasters are becoming more and more widespread. The victims have no way to appeal, and the charitable organizations have the fear of being bound. Alas, these survivors have no tears to shed, so why bother shouting in vain?</p>
<h3>Record of the Standing Committee Meeting of the Anti-Drug Association</h3>

After investigation by the Third District Public Security Bureau, it was found that the deceased was Peng Xiaoliuzi, the mastermind in the assassination of Shen Chunquan in the French Concession. Recently, he committed another crime in the western suburbs of Shanghai and fled to Pudong to avoid disaster. It is unknown how he was killed by his enemies. The case is under investigation. Yesterday, a man named Peng Xueyou from Haizhou went to the district and claimed that the deceased was his cousin, 25 years old, from Haizhou and living on Dalian Bay Road. He has a mother at home and is not married. Before his death, he helped him sell fish. Recently, he had a feud with someone in Yanzi Nest, which led to his death. He also asked to claim the body. The district chief instructed him to go to the hospital with the Baodi today to claim the body.</p>

<h3>Rotation of Police Inspectors on Two Railways</h3>
<p>Since taking office, Rong Yi, the chief inspector of police affairs for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, has spared no effort in rectifying police affairs and often personally inspects the work of various inspectors. Therefore, there have been no theft cases or other accidents in recent months. Now, Shanghai North Station is very important because it is adjacent to the concessions. The two railway inspectors have been rotated and inspectors Zhang Shuping, Zhang Hong, Pan Jinya, and Chen Jingqing have been assigned to serve at the North Station. These inspectors have been in the railway bureau for many years and are usually diligent and cautious in their work. It is said that they have taken office separately.</p>

<p>Letters</p>
<p>Dear Reporter, Recently, the China Photographic Society held a national exhibition and national competition, and invited a Westerner, Deng Tuo, as a reviewer. The organization's organization is based on ordering a pictorial as a member. Many photographers in this city who are familiar with the content do not join the association, but use the name of the country to seek personal business. However, the fact that a Westerner is hired and falsely claims to be an honorary member of the Royal Photographic Society of England to act as a reviewer of the national exhibition is too absurd. There are also many Chinese photographers who are better than Deng Tuo. This kind of action that insults the national art world will be circulated abroad and used as a laughing stock, damaging the national prestige and causing Chinese photographers to lose their international status. The crime is really unforgivable. I would like to raise a question and ask your newspaper to publish the letter in order to draw the attention of the domestic art world. Wang Yasheng respectfully started the editor. Your newspaper's local news column contains the section on "A Weng Raping Nurturing Concubine." After investigating, this matter occurred at No. 35 Xinkangli. The previous report of your newspaper was No. 55. In order to maintain the reputation of this number, please correct it as soon as possible to clarify the truth. I hope that this will be printed safely by the owner of No. 55, Miao Pinsan.</p>
<p>Editor, I respectfully start. On the 24th of this month, your newspaper's local news column contained a report on a husband suing a concubine for smoking opium. After verifying the content, it is completely inconsistent with the facts. It is believed that the information was inaccurate. (1) Jin Sheng has no four concubines. After investigating, the woman was originally an abandoned concubine of a certain surname. She met Jin Sheng and formed an evil fate. At that time, the woman was already thirty-two years old. (2) Since Jin Sheng was sued by the woman, his mind has been unsettled and his business has failed, even leading to bankruptcy. This is known to everyone in the industry. Today, he is living under someone else's roof and his livelihood is difficult. Where did the huge family fortune come from? I jointly submit a letter to request correction. I hope that the letter will be published in the reader's letter column to be grateful. I respectfully ask Zhu Jinsheng to be safe on June 27, the nineteenth year.</p>

<h3>Brief Notes on a Banquet for the China Youth Asia Walk</h3>
<p>Zhao Dingming</p>
<p>Our Chinese group's walking career, from the organization of excursions containing inspections of ancient relics and customs, etc. in order to contribute to society for academic and construction reference, the national walking group realized after this, broke through the dull air of the travel community and began to create new records of pedestrian travel. Now there are Li Mengsheng, Huang Yue, Chen Wu, Wang Xiahou, Feng Binghun, and Qiu Langming from Singapore overseas Chinese, six gentlemen, and Hu Sujuan and Cui Xiaojiong, two ladies (according to team leader Li, there are still two female comrades, Yang Jinxun and Qiu Fang, who are not sure who will go), following the National Walking Group to organize the [China Youth Asia Walking Group] can be said to be [no coincidence], the purpose of these two groups are the same, but now the scope of the Asian Walking Group is compared to the expansion of the National Walking Group especially the addition of two or three female team members is the first characteristic but in fact is half a catty or eight taels is generally valuable</p>
<p>It is said that two days before the departure of the whole Asian walking group, various groups in Shanghai, such as the Commercial Press, Shen Bao, Shi Bao, Yousheng Travel Group, and the newly established Oriental Publishing House, opened a banquet at the Nanyuan on Hard Road in the western suburbs of Shanghai at noon on the 26th of this month. At 11 am that morning, Mr. Xiqilin, a photography editor from the China Pictorial Magazine, and I took a tram to look for the initiator Huang Jingwan, but we couldn't find him. We went to the garden with Mr. Guo for a week's walk. The green shade was everywhere, and the cool breeze was blowing. The heat was gone. After a while, two or three guests came to the Buddhist Association's Taixu Master's Zen room on the upper floor of the magnificent Chinese building for a chat. The Buddhist atmosphere was full of the four walls, which made people feel quiet and inaction. Suddenly, Mr. Huang entered the door with enthusiasm, leading us to the Buddhist Association's treasure hall in a hurry. When we looked up, all the team members were</p>
<h3>Discovery of Gua Lou Dragon</h3>
<p>Old Lake</p>
<p>A guest from Xinyang, Henan, said that Li Zhengtao, commander of the Henan Militia, was building barracks in the wasteland of the former Daoshu Commander's Office for the purpose of training militia cadres. On the 5th of this month, when the craftsmen were cleaning up the weeds, they suddenly found that the roots of the vines could not be pulled out. They dug it and found something like a radish. The diggers felt strange and reported it to Li. Li ordered to add manpower to excavate and finally obtained an object, which was shaped like a dragon, white and fat, like a yam, weighing more than 50 catties. Li was very surprised, but did not know what it was. He asked someone to study it, saying that the new edition of the Materia Medica records it in the vine category, named Gua Lou Dragon, which is the essence of heaven and earth, the essence of plants and trees, a rare treasure that is not encountered in a hundred years. Li did not want to be selfish and has now carefully collected it and is about to send it to the Capital Museum for display for botanists to study.</p>
<p>Wearing yellow cloth scout uniforms, if it weren't for the fact that I had seen their Fengyi in the newspaper and had an impression in my mind, I would have almost been as confused as the ancient saying goes, disguised as Mulan, confused about male and female.</p>
<p>At this time, Huang Jingwan was busy turning east and west, showing off his social skills, and introducing the representatives of various groups and team members to each other in an instant. First, Mr. Ye Gongchuo represented Jiyanan in a speech and gave the team a variety of Nanyang cultural books, and Huang Yue, the representative of the team, gave a speech in response. In addition, two or three visitors were busy with their affairs, so everyone went to the pond pavilion in the garden in advance. Ge Gongzhen from Shen Bao, Zhang Youde from Shi Bao, and Guo Xiqilin and other photographers took photos one after another, and then returned to the very cool Buddhist hall to take a seat. Three tables were arranged, and a total of 20 guests and hosts attended the banquet. Fresh fruits were added after the banquet. Huang Jingwan then represented the various groups to report on the opening of the farewell party, expressing the desire to work together with the various groups and the Asian Walking Group to strive for social causes in the same way. Ge Lin and other gentlemen then gave speeches separately. Chen Binhe from the Japanese Research Society presented the team with several books on Japanese research and planned to provide material assistance to the team. The team pushed the representative Huang Yue to thank him and stated that they did not accept material assistance at the moment and hoped to provide spiritual assistance, which shows the team's spirit of perseverance and determination. After the meeting, they went to Nanyuan to browse carefully together, and the photographers took several reels of film and many photos in the corners of the green willows and the flat grass.</p>
<h3>Capital Pleasure Boat Notes</h3>
<p>Lü Bing</p>
<p>Nanjing has long been a capital for emperors and a gathering place for famous ministers and wealthy merchants. Therefore, it was more prosperous than other places. The songs and music at the Qinhuai Riverhead every night were intoxicating, with the river flowing like grease, all described in poetry. Although times have changed and the world has shifted, and the magnificent atmosphere of the past no longer exists, visitors to Nanjing still linger and reminisce on the edge of the small park, or still buy a boat and slowly enjoy the beauty of the Qinhuai River. The sound of strings and pipes can be heard from afar but not approached closely (the area near the Confucius Temple is full of teahouses with singing girls performing a cappella). However, in the steaming heat, an evening outing is full of cool and refreshing fun, so there is no need to add these vulgar and gaudy women.</p>
<p>The larger Qinhuai pleasure boats are beautifully decorated with carved and painted loose lacquer, while the interior is exquisitely furnished. Six or seven guests can sit or lie down in them, feeling spacious. The smaller boats are narrower and also beautifully decorated. The size varies according to the number of guests. In the prosperous months of May and June, every evening at sunset, when the evening breeze gently blows, the Qinhuai River is already filled with boats, end to end, like swimming dragons. Since the prohibition of prostitution, their livelihood has plummeted. In the past, there were more than two hundred pleasure boats, but now there are no more than one-tenth of that number. Most of those who relied on boats for a living have abandoned their boats and gone ashore to find other ways to make a living. Although the current pleasure boat business is not as good as before, it is still sustainable. Guests who enjoy evening outings often rent them to cool off, and some even have small phonographs to play music by the river to dispel the loneliness, but they cannot bring along heavily made-up young women.</p>
<p>In addition to the Qinhuai River, there are also some pleasure boats in Wuzhou Park in the capital, but the boats are small and the decoration is inferior. They can only be used for a short trip. The park is located near the Central Party Headquarters, commonly known as Houhu (Back Lake). Based on its geographical features, it is divided into Europe, Asia, America, Africa, and Australia. Since Nanjing was designated as the capital, the management and arrangement have gradually become more artistic. Therefore, during holidays, tourists row around, and the cool air is refreshing. The boats are like ordinary rowboats with rattan chairs inside. The boatmen are often village women who sing a song of lotus picking when they are in the mood to please the guests. The rental fee is only about thirty cents per hour.</p>
<h3>Pomona College Confers Honorary Doctorate of Literature on Mei Lanfang</h3>
<p>Report (Part 1) Ji Rushan</p>
<p>Mr. Mei Lanfang's trip to the United States has been met with unparalleled welcome everywhere. The academic community has paid particular attention to him. When he performed in New York, Chicago, and other places, the presidents and teachers of the schools there, after watching the performance, often gave lectures to the students, praising the elegant structure of Chinese opera and Mr. Mei's profound artistry. The professors in music and drama classes all instructed their students to watch Mei's plays, acknowledging the literary value of Chinese opera. When the performances in Los Angeles were about to end, Dr. Charles K. Edmunds, president of Pomona College, and Dr. Kenneth Duncan, were both teachers of Mr. Situ Kuan, a Cantonese friend. One day, they said to Situ Kuan, "The newspapers in New York, Chicago, and other places have praised Chinese opera and Mr. Mei's artistry for their great literary and artistic value. After watching Mr. Mei's performances here several times, we have found them to be even more wonderful. Moreover, there are aspects of Mr. Mei's strengths that the newspapers have not fully covered. His reputation is truly well-deserved. We have discussed the possibility of our school awarding Mr. Mei an honorary doctorate of literature. What do you think?" Situ Kuan came to consult me, and I thought that this was a matter of honor and that it should be acceptable. Situ Kuan immediately informed the president, who then convened a general meeting of all trustees and professors to put forward the proposal, which was unanimously approved. The president said that the graduation ceremony would be held on June 16, and the degree would be awarded to Mr. Mei on that day. Situ Kuan said that Mr. Mei was scheduled to leave for Honolulu around June 6 and would not be able to wait. The president said that the school's degree-awarding ceremony was always very grand, and it would be inconvenient to award the degree if the person was not present. According to school regulations, a few years ago, the school wanted to award Mr. Shi Zhaoji a doctorate of law, but he was unable to attend because he had gone to Europe, so the matter was dropped. It would be difficult if Mr. Mei was not present this time. Situ Kuan said that the departure date was already set and could not be changed. What could be done? The president said, "Let me think about it. Perhaps there is a way to change the arrangements and hold a special meeting in advance, but it still requires the approval of all trustees and professors. This spring, the British Labour Prime Minister MacDonald came to the United States, and a certain university in the east also awarded him a degree in advance because he could not wait long. This is the only example in decades. Now we are imitating this practice, which is usually not easy to pass, but because of Mr. Mei, I am sure that everyone will approve." The next day, another meeting was convened, and the proposal was unanimously approved. It was decided to hold the ceremony on May 28. On that day, at 2:00 PM, Mr. Mei arrived at the president's house first. I, Situ Kuan, and Mei Qiju went together, as Mei Qiju was also assisting in this matter. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Huang went directly from the hotel. Mr. Mei changed into his academic gown at the president's house and was escorted to the university auditorium by Dr. Deng Qin and Dr. Xu Zhang. The auditorium could hold more than a thousand people. There were more than twenty rows of chairs on the stage. The president, Mr. Mei, Dr. Deng Qin, and Dr. Xu Zhang sat in the first row, and the rest of the trustees and professors, more than a hundred people, sat in the remaining rows. I also joined them. Everyone was wearing doctoral gowns, looking elegant and dignified, solemn and respectful. The students were in the auditorium, and the guests were in the corridors. Everyone was very quiet. On the opposite balcony sat more than two hundred senior students, all wearing academic gowns and caps, looking particularly solemn.</p>
<h3>The Grand Master of the Literary World</h3>
<p>Zhenzhong Ge</p>
<p>Literary works change with the times. In ancient times, music and literature were combined, but they have become increasingly separated. The key to their union and separation lies in the ci poetry and northern and southern tunes. During the Song Dynasty, ci poetry was composed according to strict rules. Later, the northern and southern tunes arose, and the rules of ci poetry were abandoned. To this day, many people study ci poetry, but they focus on calligraphy and neglect the rules of rhythm and meter, which have not been passed down. This is no longer the complete form. In the Qing Dynasty, Jiang Kui's "Ci Lü" was considered an outstanding work and a standard to be followed, but it still contained errors. During the Kangxi era, there was an imperially commissioned "Ci Pu" (Ci Poetry Manual), which was kept in the Tianlu Library for scholars to consult. Its excellence goes without saying. Unfortunately, it was not widely circulated, and printed copies could sell for hundreds of gold, making it inaccessible to most scholars. The Medical Bookstore is now publishing a photographic reprint, which is accurate and costs only a little over ten yuan. The "Ci Pu" contains a comprehensive collection of various schools of ci poetry, with each word and tone marked. It also lists the differences between various schools after each ci. Even the smallest details are not neglected. Those who study literature and ci poetry can use this book to understand the mysteries of rhythm and perhaps rediscover the lost art of songwriting that has been dormant for centuries. This is its guiding influence. In recent years, many scholars have favored ci poetry, focusing on rhetoric and neglecting rhythm, or relying on "Shi Yu Tu Pu" (Poetry Remnants and Illustrated Manual) and Jiang Kui's "Ci Lü" as their basis, which is insufficient. With the publication of this book, I hope that it will not be overlooked, and I am happy to promote it.</p>
<p>Heartfelt Warmth (II) (II) (III)</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Farewell Banquet: Plucking Flowers to Leave a Debt of Affection</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen returned to the state he was in before he met Ruiyun on his second visit to Shanghai. He walked aimlessly along the streets and alleys. He was happy to go wherever he wanted, just like an examiner opening examination papers recommended by village officials. There were many papers that were indeed worthy of selection, and many that were not. This cannot be blamed on the blindness of the examiner, but rather on the incompetence of the officials. Each section of the brothel also produces a new batch of girls, just like the flower markets in spring and the fruit markets in autumn, with good and bad harvests. In a good year, many rising stars emerge in response to the times. In addition to the "Little Four Kings," there are also the "Two Hum-Ha Generals." Once promoted, they naturally gain a reputation. A section of the brothel often produces many new girls, just like a field where all the scholars are famous. In a bad year, it is difficult to find any new girls. Even if there are a few new girls, they feel that they are not perfect and have too many flaws. Some people say that a good harvest is always followed by a bad harvest. This saying is not without reason. The time of hide-and-seek at the Mirror Club can be considered a golden age. Now, some have married, some have left the brothel, and some have faded away. The time in the brothel is shortened to a section of the year, and a year's work is as long as three years. The changes are too drastic. For them, a lifetime is only ten years, from the first month of their sixteenth year to the twelfth month of their twenty-fifth year. At the age of twenty-five, they have the same perception as an ordinary person at the age of six. In fact, the life of a beauty is only ten years, but this is especially evident for the girls in the brothel. Zuo Shichen considered this to be a bad time. He collected many recommended papers, but there were no outstanding articles that would satisfy him. They were all mediocre papers. Among them, there was only one that could be considered a "brothel treasure." It could be considered finding gold in the sand. It was Yi Yuanyuan, who lived in Tingyun Lane. She was very young. Although she told all the customers that she was sixteen years old, she was actually only fourteen years old. The person who recommended Yi Yuanyuan was also an old legalist. Although he could not be said to be supremely talented, he could be considered elegant. But unfortunately, Yi Yuanyuan was a clay beauty. She did not open her mouth much when she saw people. It was as if she was an oyster that could not be opened, and she was not willing to call out even when asked to do so. At least you had to ask her two questions before she would answer one. Some customers joked with her, saying that if she did not open her mouth, they would have to use dummy coins to pay the bill. But some people recited poems to console her, saying, "Flowers can understand words, but they are troublesome. Stones cannot speak, but they are most lovable."</p>

<p>The Silver Dollar Market Was Slightly Calm This Week</p>
<p>In previous years, the financial market was usually quiet and uneventful during the peak of summer. However, this year's situation is different. Business is more active than in the spring months, and the market is correspondingly more vibrant, no longer as calm as in the past. Therefore, the market has been quite noteworthy in recent days, only calming down yesterday because it was Sunday. In the market, the spot price of silver dollars in the morning market was 72.35 cents, and in the afternoon market, it was 72.38875 cents. The result was an increase of 0.625 cents compared to the previous day. The situation remains firm and strong, and it is feared that it will continue to rise tomorrow. The transaction volume of outward foreign exchange bills was 260,000 in the morning market and 410,000 in the afternoon market. The transaction volume of banknotes was 25,000 in the morning market and 10,000 in the afternoon market. The over-the-counter transaction volume of banknotes was 43,000 in the morning market and 50,000 in the afternoon market. The transaction volume of new currency was 23,000 in the morning market. The spot price of foreign currency in the afternoon market was 155,000, plus another one million from customer shipments. On the same day, the Silver Public Bureau received over 4.3 million. The interbank lending rate in the morning market was 1.3 cents and in the afternoon market 1.2 cents, which was also more volatile than the previous day. The transaction volume of interbank lending bills was over 7 million. Banks and merchants suspended all silver dollar trading and collections without any news to report. Small money houses traded over 300,000 in foreign exchange. The spot price of Jiangsu small foreign coins in the morning market was 63.6 cents, and in the afternoon market, it was 63.5 cents. The transaction volume was 1,000 jiao in the morning market and 1,500 jiao in the afternoon market. The spot price of Guangdong small foreign coins in the morning market was 60 cents, and in the afternoon market, it was 60.01 cents. The transaction volume was 80,000 jiao in the morning market and 75,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were changed to 396,000 wen for every 3,000 wen.</p>
<h3>Yuan Coins to Disappear from Shanghai</h3>
<p>Recently, the Nanhua Gang has been buying Yuan Head new coins at higher prices, regardless of quantity, for shipment out of the country. As a result, spot Yuan coins have almost disappeared from the market. Now, small money houses are seeking profit (because there is a profit of 7-8 cents per dollar, i.e., 70-80 taels per 10,000 dollars) by scheming to find coins in the market. Since there are no coins to be collected in the market, they are trying to exchange current dollars for current dollars from the warehouses of various banks, targeting the treasurers of the banks and promising to exchange current dollars for current dollars to collect coins. According to industry insiders, each box contains no less than 600-700 dollars, and no less than 100-200 dollars. With this collection of Yuan coins, they are bound to be depleted, and since there are no new coins being minted, it is impossible for them to reappear on the market.</p>
<h3>Banks to Close for Two Days for Semi-Annual Accounting</h3>
<p>Today is the end of the half-year, and all kinds of accounts must be tallied. As usual, businesses will be closed for two days starting the next day (i.e., July 1st) for consolidation of major accounts. Therefore, Chinese and foreign banks (excluding small banks) and customs companies in Shanghai will be closed for two days on July 1st and 2nd, and will resume normal business on July 3rd.</p>

<p>Major Changes in Gold Bids Last Week</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the price was very strong, reaching 622.2 taels.</p>
<p>At the end of the week, the price fell sharply, with a total drop of over 40 taels.</p>
<p>There are still fears of major fluctuations in the future.</p>
<p>The market was chaotic and uncontrollable. Last week, there was a shocking fluctuation in the gold market, with daily differences ranging from 10 to more than 20 taels. The market was extremely chaotic and uncontrollable. The waves were dangerous, and people felt confused. Both long and short positions were in great fear. At the beginning of the week, the price rose very sharply, with good momentum. Then, a new peak was discovered, breaking the previous week's record, reaching 622.2 taels. This was due to the low silver price and tight exchange rates, as well as the strong buying of major players. The long position was surging. Then, signs of a reversal began to appear. At the end of the week, the price suddenly plummeted, with the fall reaching its peak. The reason for this was that a few days ago, when the price was at its highest, rumors spread that the government had a huge amount of settlement funds and that a certain bank was shipping cash out of the country. However, these rumors turned out to be false. Furthermore, due to the summer holidays of banks and the semi-annual settlement, the banks had to close for two days. The general public changed their minds. Major players such as Fuchang, Yuanxingyong, Yuansheng, Xinheng, and Jindayong were selling heavily. Many long positions were turning into short positions, which was shocking and led to deep losses. The total drop was over 40 taels, which suddenly broke below 580 taels. Short positions were turning from worry to joy, but the industry seemed stunned and at a loss. The final result was 584 taels, a sharp drop of 28 taels compared to the end of the previous week, with the settlement falling by 70-80 taels. The weekly overview is described in detail below.</p>
<p>A drop of 28 taels compared to the previous week. From Monday, US and UK silver prices fell frequently, and exchange rates also rose. The internal market turned from tight to loose. The gold market weakened. The opening price in August was as high as 616.5 taels. Then, buyers showed courage and reached 19 taels. Then, as the exchange rate rebounded, sellers were still plentiful. In the afternoon, the price broke the 10-tael mark and closed at 608 taels, down 4.5 taels compared to the end of the previous week. The situation was reversed the next day. The major price and exchange rates both rose, but the internal market turned strong, showing a clear weakening. The opening price was stable, but then slightly declined. The afternoon result was a rise of 10 taels, totaling 19 taels, due to rumors of cash being shipped out of the country. On Wednesday, both silver and exchange rates contracted. The trend was weak in the morning, and sellers were emboldened. In the afternoon, there was a sudden reversal, with a record high of 22.2 taels. The demand exceeded the supply. On Thursday, the major price rose slightly, and the exchange rate remained unchanged. The gold market showed a reversal. The opening price was 617.8 taels, but then fell by more than 4 taels. Then, it rose slightly by more than 1 tael, then plummeted by 8 taels. The afternoon closing price was 613.3 taels, a drop of 8.8 taels. On Friday, the price was stable at first, but then weakened and broke the 600-tael mark. Silver prices contracted slightly, and exchange rates rose slightly. The internal market also weakened. The industry was competing to sell, so the afternoon closing price was 595.5 taels, rebounding by 6-7 cents. On Saturday, there was a sudden shocking drop of more than 20 taels. The major price and exchange rates rose, and the internal market was also loose. The morning price was 604.5 taels, but then there was a violent storm. The industry was frightened, and major players tended to sell, almost causing the collapse of high-rise buildings. The price plummeted by more than 20 taels to 576 taels at noon. Then, it rebounded and broke the 80-tael mark, closing at 584.5 taels. The difference in the mid-day price was 28.5 taels, which was rarely seen. Compared to June 21st, there was a sharp drop of 28 taels on the 28th, and the rebound was also very strong. There are still fears of major fluctuations in the market. The difference between the highest and lowest prices this week was 46.2 taels, which was a giant wave, even more so than in the previous week. The high and low points of the UK and US silver markets and exchange rates are listed below:</p>

<h3>Sharp Fluctuations Still Dominated the Bond Market Last Week</h3>
<p>Customs, Reorganization, Disarmament Fell Sharply</p>
<p>Total Weekly Turnover Exceeded 4.7 Million</p>
<p>During the past week, the bond market in the local securities market experienced fluctuations. Although the market atmosphere was not dull due to the time being around settlements, the total turnover was far less than the previous week. Spot transactions totaled 97,800 yuan. As for futures, excluding Friday when the market was closed for the June futures settlement, Monday was the most active day with a turnover of over 1.3 million yuan. Tuesday and Wednesday each saw 9 million yuan, while Thursday was the quietest with just over 5.6 million yuan. The weekend rebounded with over 10 million yuan. The total was 4,739,500 yuan, a decrease of over 3.01 million yuan compared to the previous week. Bond prices fluctuated significantly. The beginning of the week was calm, and buying interest was strong. Market conditions were still good, with prices continuing to rise from the previous week. Customs, Reorganization, and other bonds each rose by 1.3 to 4 jiao. Tuesday started strong but then uniformly weakened. On Wednesday, news suddenly spread about the deteriorating situation and the tension in Hunan and Shandong, causing widespread panic. Selling surged, while buying sentiment felt scattered. Reorganization and Customs futures fell by two jiao, and Disarmament even fell by three yuan. The trend stabilized on Thursday, but on the weekend, the bond market environment turned unfavorable again. Furthermore, the exchange reopened for the 19th-year Customs and Continued Bonds, significantly increasing the amount of circulating bonds in the market. As a result, market sentiment turned weak, and selling was very active. Supply and demand were severely imbalanced, and bond prices plummeted across the board. Disarmament fell to nearly a standstill. Reorganization, Customs, Rehabilitation, Integrated 6, and other bonds also fell sharply. As a result, compared to the previous week, the July Disarmament bond fell sharply by 5.7 yuan. The July Customs, Reorganization, and other July futures each fell by two to three yuan. Furthermore, the June futures were only active for the first two days of the week, and the August futures only started trading on Thursday. The following is a statistical list of the high, low, and price changes of the local securities market bonds last week (in units of yuan): Bond type, Current/Futures, Highest week, Lowest week, Change</p>

<p>The Cotton Yarn Market, Feeble and Breathless Last Week</p>
<p>The current situation is such that purchasing power from all parties has greatly declined.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton is failing, and future progress is being further suppressed.</p>
<p>The yarn market was rather unstable at the beginning of the week, but a certain manufacturer's bullish sentiment remained firm and refused to loosen, so the situation was able to maintain itself for a while. Soon after, the price of Japanese Three-Product Yarn plummeted because of the turbulent political situation in India and the intensifying anti-foreign movement. The sales of Three-Product Yarn were cut off, and inventory grew thicker daily. It is said that there are about 300,000 pieces in bottom inventory. The market will be greatly affected by this huge volume of bottom stock. It happened to be the settlement period at the end of June, and the bulls were unable to support the price, so the market price saw a sharp drop, with the lowest price once reaching 98 yuan. There were also twenty-Wen Sanma Baolai and other [yarns].</p>
<p>Thousands of pieces of yarn were shipped to Shanghai, and the local market was drawn into the whirlpool. Ruida early on threw out a huge amount of parcels, about 20,000 parcels. Later, with the exposure of the flaws of Three-Product Yarn, many retail bulls became uneasy. Short sellers saw the activities of the bulls and took the opportunity to put heavy pressure on the market, and the market fell sharply. The situation was particularly weak, but the Hengda manufacturer's ambition was still strong, and they bought more at every dip. Only Lichang, Tianlong, and Tianchang, seeing the bad general trend, painfully liquidated and settled two or three ten thousand parcels in two days. Lichang went short on six or seven thousand pieces. In short, the current situation is unstable, the price of rice is high, and purchasing power from all parties is greatly weakened. Inventory of yarn is gradually increasing, and it is quite difficult for the market to recover. As for the decline of the world cotton industry, it is another major pressure. Changes in the future may be even more drastic. The prices of standard yarns for each month fell by three to four liang compared to the previous week. Total weekly turnover was counted at 194,100 parcels. Of these, merchants bought 5,720 parcels of spot yarn. Colleagues advanced 3,900 parcels. The market price of 16-count Japanese yarn fell by two to three liang, and other [yarns] fell by about two liang. Factories are opening very little. The purchase volume of each group is recorded below:</p>
<p>Group Amount Group Amount Group Amount</p>
<p>Newchwang 425 Changsha 20 Yantai 75</p>
<p>Inland 1170 Hankou 260 Tianjin 620</p>

<h3>A Week of Cotton Market Reversal</h3>
<p>The world cotton industry has repeatedly suffered disastrous falls.</p>
<p>Cheap Indian Cotton Invades Current Sales</p>
<p>The cotton market fell sharply last week, mainly because American cotton consumption decreased, bottom inventory increased, and new cotton weather reports were favorable. The world cotton industry is declining, and there are more layoffs. Raw materials are oversupplied, and at the same time, foreign exchange is easing. Indian cotton is collapsing wildly, falling as much as 32 rupees in one day. Such a disastrous collapse is rare in history. The current price of Indian cotton is very cheap, so people are excited, and most buyers must rely on the strength of the gold market. They now see prices falling sharply and bills of exchange lingering, and small investors are in a panic. Furthermore, Ruida Hao is selling aggressively for twenty or thirty thousand piculs, which is putting even more pressure on the market. Japanese merchants are also frequently selling short, so the market is collapsing greatly and the decline is becoming more and more extreme. Judging from the situation in the world, it is difficult to see a turnaround at present. The price of standard flowers for each month fell by one liang six, seven, or eight qian compared to the previous week. Total weekly turnover was counted at 352,000 piculs. The current price of Indian cotton is very cheap, and Shenxin has exclusively purchased a lot. The more native cotton transactions fall, the source calculates Yao cotton 3,900 bales, Tong cotton 500 bales, factory advance 33,250 piculs, colleagues advance 2,400 piculs. American cotton fell by ten pounds compared to the previous week. Yesterday, India fell by over twenty rupees. The amount of cotton purchased by each manufacturer and colleague is recorded below:</p>
<p>Manufacturer Advance Highest Price Lowest Price Turnover</p>
<p>Agra 30.75 ······ 3,000 pieces Shipped to factory</p>
<p>Amra 54.50 ······ 2,000 pieces Again Again</p>
<p>Xingheng Flower 35.25 ······ 3,000 pieces Again Again</p>
<p>Shaanxi Flower 38.75 36.50 750 pieces Spot again</p>
<p>Company Advance</p>
<p>American Flower 48.25 47.50 500 pieces Spot warehouse delivery</p>
<h3>American Cotton Rises Strongly, Indian Cotton Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton rose because the drought area lacked rain and news from Liverpool was good. The market was calm and firm. Futures rose by seven to nine pounds, and spot rose by ten pounds. British cotton futures rose by six to eight points, and spot fell by two points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by ten points. The Indian cotton market was stable. Pingle fell by four rupees, and forward fell by two rupees. Aumla fell by four rupees, and forward fell by three rupees. Bairaoqi fell by six rupees, and forward fell by three rupees. Original telegram recorded left (telegram of the 27th and 29th):</p>

<p>Silk Tea New Factory Director's Opening Price Falls More</p>
<p>French Sales Immobile···Factory Goods Only Open at 180 Liang</p>
<p>Since the new Changtu silk came on the market, French merchants once actively handled it. Chinese merchants, because the price of cocoons this year is not cheap, opened at a higher price. The Changtu silk factory would open at 186 or 187 liang. Recently, French sales are immobile and the opening price is getting lower and lower. The current market is only opening at 180 liang. It is also difficult to be optimistic about the future of Ju Li Jiao Silk Tou.</p>
<h3>News from the Wuyuan Tea Market</h3>
<p>Spring tea sales are slightly active. New spring tea from the Northeast of this county has been received by various companies. After the Russian Association sent a telegram to Shanghai, they discussed the price and started sales very actively. The market price also rose slightly. In recent days, the spring tea from various villages in Dawei and Miaoyuan has been bought up completely. The market price is from 48 yuan to 57 yuan, but the capacity of each company is still not strong. It is estimated that five or six tenths of the tea in the Northeast has not been sold yet. In the past ten days, each company has only purchased two or three tenths. Fangtang, Zicha</p>
<p>and Wangcun, the mountain households in various places, because no one is interested in the stored tea, the price has fallen below cost. They have now initiated a proposal to organize a company to manufacture boxed tea themselves and transport it to Shanghai for sale. This is also a good way to help the mountain households sell their stored tea.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Boxed Tea are Transported from Tun to Shanghai. After the First Character-shaped Eyebrows of each company were made, in addition to the early ones that have been transported to Shanghai for opening, the second batch will arrive in Shanghai soon. Recently, it was reported from the warehouse in Tunxi that the opening price of Zhenmei was higher than that of the seventh year. The Xingmei, Gongxi, and Zhenmei boxed tea that each company has in storage and is waiting to be transported are all hiring sedan bearers to transport them to Tunxi to load and transport them to Shanghai by land. In recent days, no less than two or three thousand boxes of tea have been exported from Tunxi. The Mazi-shaped Eyebrows and Gongxi of each company can be transported completely in recent days. The Erzi Zhenmei is being made and is expected to be piled up for shipment in about a week.</p>
<p>Zicha Flourishes, Sales are Smooth and Prices are Firm. The Zicha of each summer village in this county has flourished due to the weather. The fragrance and thickness of the leaves are no less than the first tea. The mountain households do not want to pick and manufacture Zicha because they still have a lot of spring tea to sell. However, this year's Zicha has fine and tender products and there are many Zhenmei materials, so the tea companies are in great need. Recently, Zicha from various villages is being produced very vigorously. Tea merchants are searching and buying day and night. The market price is from four jiao to five jiao per catty. The tea companies are receiving it at 60 yuan to 48 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>The Tunxi Tea Market is Gradually Becoming Active</h3>
<p>After the Tunxi new tea was stopped from being received by the companies because they were pressing the price, the market declined. The tea houses accumulated a mountain of tea. Up until last week, there were no less than five or six thousand dans. Recently, because the opening price of Xingmei in Shanghai has been firm, it has become very active again. In recent days, the negotiation and transactions of tea stored in various tea houses have gradually become active. The market price is from 30 yuan to more than 50 yuan. If the Shanghai market is firm and does not decline, new companies may temporarily increase the number of tea merchants in each tea house, because the tea market is gradually turning around and there is hope without fear, and worries have been slightly relieved.</p>

<p>Giant Sea Market</p>
<p>Zhabei Will Have a Printing Vocational School</p>
<p>Since the Hanli Company in Shanghai put the newly invented Zhongling Printing Machine on sale, printing has been very convenient, and all sectors are happy to purchase it. The business is developing. According to statistics, no less than several thousand of these printing machines have been sold in this city. Although the writing and printing procedures are extremely simple and can be learned by practicing according to the instructions, wealthy merchants each have duties. After purchasing the machine, all printing must be done by hiring someone to do it. The company, seeing this, must first teach this talent to meet the needs of all sectors' employment and can introduce occupations, with the spirit of mutual aid, to seek social relief. It is planned to set up a printing vocational school at 51 Jiangwan Road, Zhabei, specializing in teaching chemical knowledge and the surgery of using printed documents. Graduates in one month do not pay tuition. The factory director of the company's manufacturing plant, French engineer Mr. Gao Muhong, serves concurrently as the president and professor. It is heard that the enrollment regulations have been drafted by Mr. Zhongling, taking advantage of this summer vacation to open the school.</p>
<h3>Business News</h3>
<p>The China Camel Wool Factory Issuing Office, originally organized by We Lun, Xian Da, Sheng Da, Tian Xiang, and Wei Yi five factories, temporarily dissolved last year due to the expiration of their contract. It is now heard that it has been reorganized into the China Woolen Fabric Factory Trade Association. Due to various difficult problems, Wei Yi Factory requested fellow businesses to voluntarily have all of its products collectively sold by We Lun, Xian Da, Sheng Da, and other factories. It is heard that a contract was being drafted yesterday. After the establishment of this association, market prices will be unified, benefiting both customers and manufacturers. This is truly good news for the Chinese goods industry amidst the precious metal and cheap silver situation.</p>
<p>The American company Hengda Foreign Firm announces that the German Pengbo Lun Factory specializes in providing the world's finest weaving materials. Pengbo Lun silk products from this factory have long been popular in the weaving machinery industries of Europe, America, and Japan. This firm, located at No. 3 Museum Road, is the agent for the factory's products. The Jiufu Company on Ningbo Road, Shanghai, has been appointed as the general manager of this silk, all due to recognizing that Shanghai ladies often purchase Hua Er silk yarn, Qiao Qi silk yarn, and other winter Pengbo Lun silk clothing materials, with most of the raw materials being woven from Pengbo Lun silk. Shanghai's major silk weaving factories, wanting to imitate this, have been unable to find technicians to guide them. This firm has repeatedly telegraphed the German factory's technician, Tian Ji, to come to China. It is now known that Mr. Tian Ji arrived in Dalian on the 26th and will soon arrive in Shanghai. It is believed that after Mr. Tian Ji arrives in Shanghai to guide weaving techniques, Shanghai's major silk weaving factories will certainly develop new features day by day.</p>
<p>The Shanghai dealer of the German old-brand Lion Strength beef juice, Huada Foreign Firm, announces that Lion Strength beef juice is produced by the German Martha Pharmaceutical Factory, with the main factory located in Berlin and the general manager being Dr. Heller, a medical doctor. During the European War, he served as the captain of the hygiene corps. During the Battle of Verdun, the German army fought fiercely for over forty days with food supplies cut off. Each person consumed only a quarter of an ounce of Lion Strength beef juice daily, ultimately achieving victory. As a result, it became popular throughout Europe and sold extremely well. This beef juice is of pure quality, mild in nature, and functions to enhance essence, benefit marrow, strengthen the brain and nerves, generate blood, grow muscle, nourish congenital deficiencies, and nurture postnatal nourishment. It can also nourish stomach strength and prevent seasonal epidemics, and is unaffected by any weather. For patients and those with weak constitutions, it is an unparalleled treasure during this summer period. The three companies' western medicine departments, canned goods departments, and major pharmacies in Shanghai all sell it.</p>
<p>The New Universal Grand Circus at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Route Cardinal, has brought a large group of male and female performers from Europe to Shanghai to perform various astonishing stunts. The circus is highly praised by the people of Shanghai and features trained tigers, elephants, orangutans, and monkeys performing. In addition, the famous French Parisian acrobat Fa Lin Si is performing on stage. Audiences have been very enthusiastic for days. It is heard that starting today, the program will be changed to a newer and even more moving show than before.</p>

<p>Book Reviews</p>
<p>A Collection of Guo Fu's Novels　　　Bing Hui</p>
<p>Published by Modern Bookstore</p>
<p>Satirical works are not abundant in the Chinese literary scene. Those that exist are mostly essays and casual notes to support the facade. As for novels in this genre, it's truly hard to count a few. Now, looking at this [Collection of Guo Fu's Novels], it appears to be a rather stimulating satirical novel.</p>
<p>Writing satirical novels is inherently not an easy task. The author must first possess sharp eyes to observe some disharmonious or unreasonable matters. Then, they must adhere to the conditions of a novel, presenting these matters humorously in the work so that readers can understand the target of the satire. Only then can they achieve the ultimate goal of a satirical novel without losing its effectiveness. In this book, I feel that the author possesses this ability, enabling readers to feel a sense of sorrow and delight.</p>
<p>This book contains twelve novels. Except for [The Great Invention of War Weapons], [The Ideal Small Inventor], and [A Man's Breast], which were originally intended as children's literature as stated in the preface, the other nine describe the dark aspects of the old Chinese society. The author uses a satirical tone to vigorously attack the dying feudal labor and traditional thinking, revealing the ugliness of various gray characters under his pen.</p>
<p>Most obviously, we can see over a dozen types of people in [A Story in a Big Family]. He tells us that in this large family, there's the third uncle who graduated from a science department at a certain university and served as a county magistrate for one term, considering himself noble and refusing to come out unless someone invites him; there's the seventh old master who keeps a queue, wears a robe, and advocates restoring everything ancient; there's the foreign philosophy PhD who brought back [new] and [old] philosophies; there's the fifth brother who loves money more than life; there's the third grandfather who is diligent and frugal, willing to be a beast of burden for his children and grandchildren; there are the fourth uncle and fourth aunt who play with each other; there's the widowed eldest aunt who cries constantly and acts like a chamber pot to whoever she sees; there's the third brother who is resented by his sons for having too many siblings; there's the father of a family who has produced three specialists—the father is a specialist in earning money, the son is a specialist in spending money, and the daughter is a specialist in aesthetics; there's the Quiet Studio uncle who attributes everything to fate; there's the Zheng Xin brother who married a servant but is despised; there's the Fo Sheng brother who wears the mask of a philanthropist but amasses wealth; there's the ninth uncle who is a self-proclaimed Confucian doctor who kills without lifting a finger; there's the Wei Sheng brother who gets promoted and becomes rich, calling himself an old revolutionary; and there are the parents who don't let their son study but listen to the fortune-telling blind man, waiting for the emperor to appoint him to the Hanlin Academy, ultimately causing their son to commit suicide. In short, the activities of these ugly people are commonly seen and heard by us daily. The author is not only portraying a big family but is actually creating a microcosm of society.</p>
<p>Because the author excels at portraying the gray lives of old China, in the chapter [Good Deeds], he writes about an elderly gentleman who wants his son to have a fat grandson soon so he and his wife can be happy in their old age. Therefore, he decides to do more good deeds and establishes an orphanage. In just a few months, he ends up killing over eighty infants, yet society still considers him to be doing good deeds. In the chapter [Terrible Assassination], there's a doctor who kills without a knife, just like the ninth uncle in the story of the big family, yet society still considers him to be virtuous and attentive. The parents of the victim are still grateful to him. In these two chapters, the author fully questions the standards of good and evil in society, in other words, destroying the idols of society, which reminds us of Ibsen's [Pillars of Society].</p>
<p>[People Who Don't Produce] is about an elderly man whose life's work is to manage his own tomb. On the day of his death, he gathered his children and left a will, saying, [My tomb has been managed for many years and is my life's work. You must preserve it well... Starting from the day I die, hire monks and Taoists to perform repentance ceremonies for forty-nine days. It's best to choose a day when the silkworms are busy, and the funeral procession should be ten miles long, with a good show performed for seven days in front of the tomb...] This is enough to represent the psychology of the average old person. [A Clever Person's Business] is about a so-called clever person who disregards public health for personal gain. These types of clever people are the most common. The protagonist of [The Fruit of Education] is a returned student who graduated in agriculture from abroad. The author borrows an elderly person's words to deliver an excellent satire:</p>
<p>What's the point of learning? Like my godson, who studied agriculture abroad, is he really going to be a farmer? Do you think he can hold a hoe after getting used to holding a cane? Can he plow the fields barefoot after getting used to wearing leather shoes? Like Miss Wang, who studies to be a teacher, is she a rich lady who wants to sit on a cold bench and teach all day? Frankly speaking, the children of wealthy families have to study, and when they grow up, they have to learn something to put in their belly so people won't look down on them... My eldest grandson is always clamoring to go abroad... Do you know what his purpose is? He just wants to write English love letters like my godson and marry a wife like Miss Wang when he returns home.</p>
<p>We have seen the ugliness of the old characters, but at the same time, we also see that the so-called new characters are no different. The author uses a light and subtle tone to write, which feels exceptionally refreshing to read, but immediately makes you feel deep sorrow.</p>
<p>[Rejuvenation] is an idealistic and rather comical work. It satirizes the disparity between the rich and poor, making people realize that the poor have lost all rights and live in another world. [Adding Rice] is the most humorous chapter in this book, but it is also the shortest. In this short chapter, he fully expresses the thoughts and lives of the Chinese scholar-official class. From this chapter, we can conclude that the author certainly has the ability to write short stories.</p>
<p>Now, let's see what kind of society these gray people form. The author tells us this situation in [Administration]. In fact, we feel that it's not just Huzhou that is like this; it's like this all over China.</p>
<p>As for unzipping your pants and urinating on the streets and spitting phlegm wherever you open your mouth, this is how the descendants of the Yellow Emperor have been for thousands of years, so it's not surprising. Moreover, being scolded and laughed at is fine; I'll do what I want anyway. This is the magnanimity of a great citizen, and I certainly won't care about it. Talking about it is just futile.</p>
<p>Let's see how the author writes about those people's entertainment. The best place for Huzhou people to be entertained is the teahouse. The conversations of the tea drinkers in the teahouse are even more humorous than the Shanghai New World's storytelling (page 43).</p>
<p>Huzhou has a public sports field diagonally opposite the library. The land is sufficient and relatively flat, but it's rare to see athletes (page 43).</p>
<p>Originally, entertainment has never been given much attention in the minds of the Chinese. Talking about entertainment seems like nothing more than idle pastime, just teahouses, restaurants, playing cards, and whoring. Some who consider themselves elegant are just interested in playing the qin, chess, calligraphy, and painting. Thus, the land of etiquette and the refined scholars become even more decadent. Talking about physical education is like not knowing it exists, so the sports field is equal to a formality. Watching the world's nations filled with strong strength, vitality, bravery, and a spirit of sacrifice progressing rapidly, one can only passively boast about spiritual civilization. This is a morbid state, a very serious morbid state. If this kind of thinking doesn't change, the so-called [passive] thinking doesn't change, then it will be enough to be the fatal wound of our nation.</p>
<p>The author recognizes this point, so he uses a scalpel to dissect the weaknesses of our nation in detail. At the same time, he is also a needle. This needle is filled with serum and injected into the blood vessels of our nation.</p>
<p>The Devil's Dance　　Tang Zengyang</p>
<p>By Yu Guangyu</p>
<p>Beautiful prose has been relatively successful in the Chinese literary category, becoming a beautiful and colorful exotic flower. Because the content of an essay only needs to describe the author's fragmented thoughts and summarize them in writing, it does not need to fabricate many illusory events like a novel. Therefore, its style belongs to the category of concise and pithy literature. Writing it is naturally easier than creating other literary works and more likely to achieve better results. This is an inevitable fact.</p>
<p>However, if this beautiful prose is written using the style of casual notes, it easily tends towards a dry and dull state, unable to arouse the reader's beautiful emotions, just like appreciating an ordinary painting and singing a meaningless poem. This is because so-called beautiful prose relies on the poetry and imagery it contains. If it is excessively sculpted and excessively described, it loses its inherent purity and eternal charm, as well as the deep and simple beauty that is unique to prose. Therefore, some say that writing prose is best done by talented poets or painters. This statement has considerable reason, and we cannot deny it.</p>
<p>The author of The Devil's Dance, Mr. Yu Gengyu, has the qualities of a poet. He has already published a collection of poems called [Before Dawn], which has gained the attention of people who have some love for literature. Now, I will not make any judgments about his poetry but will only make a fragmented examination of this collection of essays.</p>
<p>This includes twenty short, beautiful essays. The first chapter is [Angel in the Flowing Clouds], and the last chapter is [The Cross]. Although we cannot know the standard the author used to arrange them in this order, we can infer from the titles that they contain symbolic meaning. However, on the surface, this ending is ultimately not an ending worthy of people's envy. The angel in the flowing clouds is always filled with foreign religious overtones, and being nailed to [The Cross] clearly cannot represent the concept of the Chinese nation. This is a major flaw that I must first raise in my criticism of this book. The original quality of poetry is used to reconcile the unpleasant feelings that people have in the mechanical and contradictory lives, and to arouse a strange interest from lingering tenderness to gain flexible vitality. In other words, it is to suddenly encounter a place of clear waters and green mountains in a dry and boring realm, breathe in fresh air, and the exhausted body can be instantly excited, as if stepping into another novel world, with the pure rhyme separated from the old demon cave. The effect of prose poetry undoubtedly has the element of inspiring the reader's emotions.</p>
<p>The author, Mr. Yu, has a strong writing technique. Unfortunately, the universe in his eyes is really too small. Besides [The Tomb of the Remains of Heroes], [The Stiff Corpse], [Crimson Flowing Clouds], [Miserable Black Abyss], [Ugly Tombstones], [Withered Roses], [Devils and Angels], [Decaying Wastes], [Exhausted Lean Shadows], and [Rusted Real Swords], which are deeply imprinted in his mind, it can be said that there is nothing else.</p>
<p>Such phrases and such words can be found in every one of his works. He relies almost entirely on the skill of stacking and decorating to organize a sculpted and beautiful essay. No matter how many pure and beautiful sentences and luxurious words there are, no matter how superior the style and bold the aura, he has never expressed extremely rich imagination, natural mood, or deep and simple beauty, making the reader feel an extraordinary sense of battle.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the personality of poets has belonged entirely to the category of sadness. Therefore, many poets in the web of extremely happy life must also artificially write sentimental poems, forcefully evoking sad emotions. Inevitably, the essays in Mr. Yu's collection are full of decadent colors, dreaming the sad dreams of a poet. If it were not for environmental constraints, then his kind of singing is almost a moaning without illness.</p>
<p>I am trapped in a deep, incurable world of sad illusion, weeping and groaning. How does my God let me waste away my life?</p>
<p>Where is the bell in the deep mountains?</p>
<p>Sending you to wander to the ends of the earth on this dark and desolate night, girl, please don't be sad. I am also a wanderer in the miserable hell, shedding tears of wandering.</p>
<p>The fire of sad fate is burning, illuminating the world of you and me.</p>
<p>Sending you to wander to the ends of the earth</p>
<p>In these two passages, it can be clearly seen that the author truly lies in the [realm of sad illusion] day and night, groaning alone, with infinite sorrow in his heart, sometimes wanting people to [sink] with him. Although he also writes some future aspirations in this book, hoping for the arrival of great light, let's look at his 丨</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>Alas, such is the rhythm of life, forever immersed in a dream that cannot be touched. The banquet is over, and from the drunken stupor, I glimpse this peaceful life...</p>
<p>This is truly the great world of night.</p>
<p>丨The Devil's Dance</p>
<p>Everything is making the final victorious dance in the dim shadows.</p>
<p>丨Long Sword</p>
<p>I am tired of running for my life, like a tired old crow on a cold branch, waiting silently for the hunter in the vague light in the frost and fog 丨My Fate</p>
<p>丨Empty Dream</p>
<p>The author's hopeful elements are really less than the sentimental elements. Apart from the few passages quoted above that contain a slight attempt at light and victory, I cannot find a more upward ideology in the entire book. Finally, [everything, everything is reduced to the emptiness of disillusionment...] shadow.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, it is really the author's greatest flaw. You must know that now is the era of promoting national spirit. The color of sadness has become the [remains] of the past, and there is no need to use the supreme artistic skill to excessively express it. If the author can expand his vision and pay attention to the entire nation, changing from singing about his personal sadness to singing about the sadness of the entire nation, from singing about his personal aspirations to singing about the aspirations of the entire nation, then the publication of this collection of essays will be more meaningful. The Second Issue of the Vanguard Weekly is Published</p>
<p>The Vanguard Weekly, published by the Vanguard Society, has been enthusiastically purchased since the publication of its inaugural issue. Its second issue was published on the 29th. The main points include (1) Declaration of the Nationalist Literary Movement (2) Melee (one-act play). The characters in the play include Lu Xun, Mao Dun, Li Chuli, Yu Dafu, Liang Shiqiu, etc. (3) Clearing the Lines (poem) (4) Revealing Mirror, etc. The article Melee is especially eye-catching. All major bookstores are selling it on consignment.</p>
<p>The Story of World Literature (1) (7) (2) Translated by Hu Zhongchi, written by John Macy of the United States</p>
<p>Chapter 45: Dutch and Flemish Literature</p>
<p>An important medieval mystic who wrote the religious articles that have come down to us is the fourteenth-century monk of Brussels, Ruysbroeck. The Belgian poet Maeterlinck wrote about him in [The Treasure of the Humble] and also translated (into French) one of his works, [The Adornment of Spiritual Marriage].</p>
<p>An example of the international exchange of ideas is the Dutch morality play Elckerlijc, which is undoubtedly the blueprint for the greatest of English morality plays, Everyman.</p>
<p>Another instance of the international exchange of ideas that is of particular interest to English readers is the relationship between the first poet of the Dutch Renaissance, Jan van der Noot, and Spenser. That relationship is as unclear as many biographical accounts of the Elizabethan era. However, the Dutch poet seems to have served as a medium introducing the works of Ronsard and Petrarch to the young English poet.</p>
<p>German Romanticism, despite Bilderdijk's opposition to it, largely entered Holland due to Goethe's universal influence, which no country could avoid, and the temporary influence of English Romanticism, mainly in Scott's novels. However, the new era was not very bright, and Dutch literature fell into imitation. The rigidity of the poetic form was broken by the young poet Ryk, who died at the age of twenty-one. His posthumous poems had original talent and deep emotion, arousing the youthful enthusiasm of a school that formed around his memory.</p>
<p>An extremely outstanding figure in modern Dutch literature is Louis Couperus. His poems show sympathy for the Young School, but he is more important as a novelist than as a poet. His widely translated novels can be said to have put Holland back on the literary map of Europe. His best-known work in English, which has been translated very well, is a series of four novels called [The Small Souls].</p>
<p>Related to Dutch literature is Flemish literature. This has a special vitality due to the political situation. When Belgium separated from Holland in 1839, the Flemings opposed anything with a Dutch flavor and developed things with a French and Flemish flavor. The government made</p>
<h3>Mr. Pang Xunqin's Artwork upon Returning from France (Photographed by Xu Weinan)</h3>
<p>efforts to suppress the Flemish language as the official language. This resulted in authors and scholars promoting the development of the same language. The first fruit of this movement was the novel by Hendrik Conscience. His first novel, which describes the Dutch War of Independence, [In the Year of Wonder], aroused the patriotism of his countrymen and established the literary status of modern Flemings. He wrote many stories of Flemish family life and became a national hero. Because of his faithfulness to life, he occupies not only the position of leading novelist in Flemish literature but also the position of an important figure in European literature. However, that faithfulness is extremely idealistic. The naturalist novelist Sleukus adopted a completely different method. He achieved his effects through precise observation and the accumulation of detailed matters.</p>
<p>Flemish authors are praised in Holland at least as much as in Belgium. This is one of the ironies of history. Intellectually speaking, Flemings and Dutch are no longer separated, while in Belgium as a whole, which has a dual culture, what dominates is not the Flemish style but the French style.</p>
