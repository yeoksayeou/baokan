<h3 id="c7">日本財政之蕭條景象 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>日本因商業衰落之故。影響及於證劵而致暴落。又影響及於海運業而致不振。影響及於鐵路而致裁汰職員。影響及於公家。而致東京方之捉襟見肘。博物院之環堵蕭然。然余以爲此尚第一步也。商業之不振僅數月間事。而後此之不振。尚不知何年何月而有恢復之望。則今後之因窮而蕭索。更不知何若。余又以爲若日本者。工商國遇此情况之第一國也。若商業長此不振。則凡以工商業立國者。將無一面不繼日本之後也。</p>
<p>質直言之。今日之所謂强國者。類皆由富以致强。今日之所謂富國者。類皆由工商業而致富。工業振興。自然商業發達。今以工業振興過甚之故。世界市塲。不能銷納此所産之貨。因之商業反因工業而致衰落。此其事實。非一時一地地所造成。故今後商業衰敗之命運。亦非一時一地所能補救。故以今日商業衰敗所受之厄運。决非今日所能即止。更非如今日之厄運而能即止。曠觀斯世。今後或將因此而漸趨於均平。或將因此漸成混亂。皆未可知也。</p>

<p>（續）</p>
<p>丙、關於礦業各事項</p>
<p>（一）維持停工煤礦（理由）中國煤業約分外資國資兩種、民國十七年、外資各煤礦産額約一千三百萬噸、以每工産煤率○·四五○計之、共用礦工約八萬人、國資各煤礦産額約一千二百萬噸、以每工産煤率○·二一○計之、共需礦工約十五萬七千人、是國資煤礦産額不及外資煤礦産額之半、而工人則倍之、蓋機廠少而土窰多也、又外資主要礦廠、如撫順開　等礦、均在東北數省、地方較爲安靜、且有外力保護、故能循序發展、而國資各礦多在中國腹地、時受軍事匪共及交通之影響、致礦業日就凋殘、一二年來附近平漢津浦膠濟各路煤礦、均因交通不便、或兵匪擾亂、次第停工、而江西兩湖各煤礦亦告停歇、如照民國十七年國資煤礦工人數目、以七成失業之人數計算、已達十一萬人、今欲救濟此項失業工人、則維持國資煤礦、實爲先務之急、（辦法）一·由政府準備銀三百萬元、分别補助或貸予各煤礦公司、督令從速開工、二·對於萍鄕煤礦特别籌撥銀八十萬元、暫由政府維持、三·令行鐵道部、從速增加各路車輛、並减輕運費、剔除漏規、以利運輸、</p>
<p>（二）整理東省金礦（理由）我國産金多由於砂金礦、而砂金礦之最旺者、在東北首推黑龍江、吉林次之、如觀都庫瑪漠河奇乾河餘慶溝及依蘭樺川等處、從前曾由政府設局採金、産額甚旺、至民國五年以後、忽因歐戰影響、銀漲金跌、開採不能獲利、遂致礦業中停、失業者幾達十數萬人、爾後雖有金礦公司三十餘家、繼續開採、多屬投機性質、資本旣不充足、技術復欠精良、東掘西挖、難期發達、而其餘之數萬工人永無復業之望、亟應設法恢復該地金礦事業、以救濟失業之工人、）辦法）由政府籌撥銀一百萬元、暫於黑龍江之黑河室韋兩處、及吉林之依蘭、設立採金局、招集工人擇地開採徐謀發展、（三）整理贛南鎢礦（理由）我國鎢礦出産、以贛南各縣爲最盛、湖南廣西次之、民國十七年全國鎢砂産量七千三百餘噸、約值銀二百五十餘萬元、實佔世界産額百分之六十、而江西一省所産、則占全國産額百分之九十、故贛南人民倚開採鎢砂爲生活者、凡數萬人、前由商人組織公司、包收包銷、現在此項公司業經明令取銷、亟應由政府自行籌辦、以維數萬失業人民之生計、（辦法）由中央政府與江西省政府合籌銀一百萬元、設局招工開採、暫用收砂辦法、一面採辦機械、爲有規模之設備、</p>
<p>（四）恢復貴州汞礦（理由）中國水銀原砂、多産於貴州、如省溪銅仁八寨紫江修文南籠黔西等縣、均産汞擴、尤以省溪八寨爲最著、他如湖南之鳳凰、四川之酉陽、亦皆以産汞著稱、從前汞礦産額、僅貴州一省年達一千噸、當歐戰時期、除本國自用外、出口之汞年達二百噸、爾來地方不靖、採運兩難、各地礦業因而衰落、數年前尚聞有少數出産、今則概行停採、馴致國内所用之原砂銀原、胥仰給於外洋、每年損失甚鉅、而各該省此項失業礦工約數萬人、殊爲可慮、（辦法）由政府暫撥銀二十萬元、於貴州之銅仁黃平兩縣、設局採運、藉資調劑、而謀發展、</p>
<p>以上關於礦業之四項辦法、係就實地狀况急切可行者言之、共計需欵六百萬元、可救濟失業礦工約三十萬人、此外未經開發之煤鐵礦、雲南之銅礦、陜甘之石油礦、漢冶龍烟之鐵廠、或因交通不便、或因成本過高、或因經費過鉅、一時不易舉辦、容俟另案計畫、兹不費列、（完）</p>

<p>沿革該校係宣統年間、由張季直唐蔚芝盛杏蓀諸公之發起、奏准清廷撥給吳淞砲台灣營地六十畝、自建校舍、脫離南洋大學之船政科、獨立成校、直隸於北京交通部、聘海軍耆宿薩鼎銘上將軍任校長、設備之周、敎員人選之盛、一時學校無出其右、宣統三年、假南洋大學初次招生、報名者三千餘人、甄陶妙選、類皆謹飭好學之士、其後各生服務商船、打破外人壟斷航海職業之勢力、開國人自任船長之先聲、迄今華輪船長曁主持航界重要職務者、仍以昔日學生佔居多數、惜乎民四、因故停辦、校舍由海軍部改辦海軍軍官學校、以致後起無人造成、今日國内船員供不敷求之現象、不然外人船員、早已絶跡於華輪、此豈始料所及哉、迨國民政府成立交通部長王伯羣氏鑒於航業爲當務之急、培植航材、不容稍援、毅然提議、經中央政治會議决准予重辦十八年秋恢復開學、公推王部長任校長、而以昔日同學楊志雄君副之、蓋船校恢復籌備奔走楊君之力爲多、在此十四年停辦期中時移事變一任摧殘、所有十餘萬元之儀器圖書機器校具藥品、一切雜物、蕩然無存、今以刦後餘灰規復舊觀、雖一草一木之微、莫不有待於手、自經營將與樹人樹木同一栽成、彼世人之輕言破壞者、又庸知建設之艱難、呈可慨矣、</p>
<p>敎旨該校敎學主旨、非僅使學生明嘹書本中之理論、而又兼重實地工作之嫺熟、蓋現在之習駕駛者、每有不明帆纜運用與夫水手技術之概要、而習輪機者工匠學徒之輩、對於機械原理管理構造、稍有心得者、更屬鳳毛麟、角、絶無僅有、故補弊救偏、矯正學生、自視清高不屑從事勞働工作之積習、所以平日敎育、若工廠實習、若操艇、若結繩、能油漆冲刷、以及體育運動、莫不與敎室功課、同一並重、最後再在該校自造之練艦中、受課二年、養成全才、始予畢業、</p>

<p>學級該校設駕駛科輪機科船員補習班三門十八年先招駕駛科二班、十九年招駕駛科一班、輪機科二班、以後每年續招駕駛輪機各一班、至民國二十二年駕駛科初次畢業、即分派各船充任船員、循序漸進、不須十年、必可廓清外籍船員而代以華人矣、</p>
<p>待遇該校待遇學生力從優厚船員職業、本屬艱苦、苟非習於勤勞甘於澹泊、縱使學成、亦未能委身致用、而富家子弟素耽暇逸詎肯以自命、高貴之驅騖、此艱苦辛勞之業、其果樂此不疲、負笈而來、殆必超越、凡流見有獨到或則有志好學之士、痛心航業之受制於人、奮發爲雄、而冀挽回於將來者、是皆一時俊彦、該校抱樂育英才之旨、所以優待學生、竭力减輕其負担、全年僅收膳費五十元、制服書籍自備、其餘費用、一概不收、更爲寛籌出身畢業之後、由部發給船員證書、即可充任船員、</p>

<p>在結婚以前。女子們是閉上了眼睛給男子們接吻。到了結婚以後。當伊的男子忘記和伊接吻的時候。才閉上了眼睛。</p>
<p>人生至五十五。萬事全休。并且是一個可以自悟的時代了。一個男子在五十五歲以後。假使要得少年女子的歡心。只有扮一個聖誕老人。而决無自居於「唐柔安」（古美男子）之可能了。</p>
<p>死。是一個大的險遇。可呈「結婚」却是一個最大的險遇。因爲結婚是一條新生活的路徑。一個新生活的開始。一個和素不相知的人同居的奇事。</p>
<p>「成功」殺人之烈。勝於砲火。而戀愛之殺人。又甚於「成功」。</p>
<p>一個有清明的頭腦的人。其所遭遇的事故。常與愚人們一樣的不以爲意。</p>
<p>當一個女子的地址。已不爲任何男子們所牢記。而伊的舊綽號則又常爲他們所提及時。這個女子已無絲毫幸福可言。而其綽號則與電話號碼一樣的不足爲奇了。</p>
<p>現代的女子。有從容的態度。有精審的計劃。何以知之。因爲伊在結婚以前。常會把伊以前所接受的定婚戒一一交還於原主而無誤。</p>
<p>戀愛是盲目的。可是「結婚」却是醫盲目的好方藥。所以要男女雙方互知其心。最好是結婚。</p>

<p>如臯僻居江蘇長江北岸。自民國十六年春。孫軍倚長江作困獸之鬭。如城經其蹂躪。然西南沿江之石莊·盧港·鎭濤·車馬湖·磨頭·江安·等六區。遭其荼毒尤甚。後經國軍擊潰。流落地方者殊屬不少。游手好閒。無從謀食。遂成羣結黨。攔路搶刦。繼則擄人勒贖。騷擾三四載於兹。雖經軍警剿捕。而剿此竄彼。未能肅清。向恃農爲生者。農不敢耕種。工商輟業。市面蕭條。糧食供給幾絶。以致稍富者均逃亡城垣及他埠。强暴者挺而走險。與匪徒爲伍。此六區之中。石莊鎭最爲重要。（俗稱石莊巷）距江岸約二里。通揚輪往返。均停泊該岸。裝卸貨物。自盜匪猖獗以來。該鎭增駐軍警、保護商旅居民。并時往四郊逮捕盜匪。重者立即梟首示衆。輕則具保釋放。該鎭軍警。前日又往某處捕得四盜。二名確係要犯。立即梟首懸於石橋上。二名拘於獄中。以便究訊。盜方聞訊。旋於十一日下午四時許。嘯聚千餘人。由西北兩方圍攻而來。該鎭北梢駐有軍警六名。不及防禦。遂被衝入街市。縱火焚屋。該鎭保衛團·公安局·及駐軍縣警察第三中隊聞訊。立即前往抗禦。槍聲大作。連續不絶。相持旣久。軍警槍彈將罄。有倡退却者。駐軍唐中隊長（車如）諭各軍曰。駐東西兩港分隊聞訊</p>

<p>時屆霉令。氣候不正。吾人對於霉令常識。不可不稍知一二。兹將管現所見。摭拾如後。</p>
<p>霉令中爲百物潮蒸之時。人體亦何獨不然。故每日須沐浴一次。則汗孔舒暢。排洩自易。忌食各種醬品。如霉腐乳醬黃瓜以及臭豆腐乾之類。</p>
<p>衣服須常換。被毯須常晒。窗户須常開。地板須常洗。</p>
<p>溝渠中須多澆臭藥水。可免穢氣。室内常焚盤香。得增芬芳。庭中能植花奔尤佳。</p>
<p>衣服經霪雨浸濕。切勿摺疊。須懸在透風處。</p>
<p>酒能助濕。霉令尤甚。須戒絶勿飲。</p>
<p>能綜上法行之。可免疾病。而保健康。</p>
<p>必來援救。吾守而不攻。彈勿狂發。（東新陞港距二里西張黃港距八里三中分隊駐該兩港）否則該鎭房屋盡成焦士。未幾兩港分隊果來援助。唐隊長乃指揮軍警猛攻。先後歷五小時。匪始不支而退。時已深夜。翌日拂曉。又有匪黨六名。濳往該鎭之中市。持草縱火。被軍警察破。擊斃一名。餘被遁去。是役被洗刦者。大小甚多。無從調查。房屋被燬者。共一百餘家。受傷者唐中隊長臂部。警士四名各受微傷。徐復盛糖坊店主徐萬承臂腿兩處。亡者第七分隊長劉煥。警士黃可文。其餘居民被流彈傷斃者約十餘人。并有某姓病故未幾。正備舉殯之際。亦遭縱火焚燒。死屍盡成焦炭。亦云慘矣。兹聞如邑當局有組織西南六區賑災委員會之說。然匪未肅清。農廢於野。工商輟業。縱有賑糧發放。而杯水車薪。何濟於事乎。（却酬）</p>

<p>滁州之游滁州爲津浦南段大站之一。自浦口至此計程爲一百○五華里。津浦線全長一千九百里。自浦至徐州爲南段。自徐州至濟南爲中段。自濟南至天津爲北段。各長六七百里。在昔全線祇需二十一小時便達。今則每段需二十一小時。車價亦昻於前者幾一倍。蓋除加價約三成外。尚有修理費名目。亦須旅客負擔。而路政之窳敗。車輛之殘缺。及旅客之不舒適。恰與車價之繼長增高成爲一背道而馳之正比便。目今在軍事期中。無票乘車者十有七八。路員祗有摇首嘆息不置耳。</p>
<p>滁州以歐陽公醉翁亭一記。其名乃大著。讀書人幾無不知「環滁皆山也」一語。而「醉翁之意不在酒。」尤爲一普遍之故典。但一審實際上情形。竟不然。以滁地並無衆山環抱情形。祗城南小有崗巒起伏。北方多平原。小小崗阜。出於歐陽公之筆底。便成環抱重疊之大山峯。主觀之不同有如斯者。</p>
<p>醉翁亭早已圮廢。今爲重建者。離車站十里在瑯琊山麓。稍具風景。下有瑯琊溪。一名釀泉。古今地理却無幾許變遷。滁西有清流關。爲宋太祖以周兵破李景兵十萬生擒其將姚鳳皇甫暉處。此外有豐樂亭茶仙亭等勝蹟。聞其名非不清麗典雅。而一至其地。祗見蔓草荒烟頽垣斷井而已。名勝大抵如斯。</p>

<p>三十日。是日余印一名片。索一元半。計在國内不過四角。而一元半按兌換國幣。已值二元半。蓋可知此地生活費用。與國内之差。即此一端。可推想其餘。小工每日一二元。坐人力車一點鐘須八九角。惟剃頭甚賤。本來須四角。面現減價至二角。小舖或角半。惟此地人情較國内老成。盜匪横行之事尚少。政府保護好。尚可安業。各資本冢之大門。仍然外户不閉。不甚慮盜賊。不若上海之白晝叩門而掠刧。則此地所無也。</p>
<p>共産黨問題。間亦有之。街上亦偶發現其標語。但聞此地防範之法。亦與吾國不同。聞荷屬防範之法最好。則毫無苦痛。果查出主張共産者。不加責罰。惟請其於一定地點實現其主義。此地點在孤懸海中一荒島中。無船隻來往。事爲流放共産者之所。有田可耕。令其永在此經營。聞亦有女人。想甚少也。此法較吾國内殺戮爲好。似亦無妨仿行也。</p>
<p>此間電車規矩尚好。大半係馬來人。亦有華人。人均規矩。其招待之殷勤。似日本風。而北平天津電車亦尚好。惟上海最壞。在馬來人以下也。嗚呼。</p>
<p>三十一日參觀一印度人之敎堂。大致是婆羅門。中置各種花。余恭敬脫鞋而入。從堂中望其所供之神。在黑如漆之燈中。面呈黑色。疑人疑鬼。殆似城隍。印度者。一多神敎幻想之民族也。此間有許多印度式佛像及名　。皆表示其幻想。大致皆如千手千眼觀音之類。多以象爲王。余在安南。知彼地以虎爲王。到處崇拜虎。印度則崇拜象也。觀印度畫可發生人之幻覺。亦馳騁思想之一法也。余買印度最寄回家中。與小兒玩之。至各地所畫之佛像。日本盡似日本人。北方畫似北人。西洋畫似西人。印度畫之佛像似印度人。印度式之佛像爲眞佛像也南洋一帶馬來人。雖崇回敎。而回敎人則受印度化之支配。此間僧人多遊印度。聞不過百元可往返矣。國内佛徒何不遊印度乎。日本人遊印度者。踵相接也。至本地印度人則營小販業。吉能人賣販。罕有大商。近印度領袖甘地被捕。印人漸有趨於剛强之勢。聞泰戈爾不在印度而在英倫。蓋太戈爾乃和平者。不若甘地爲抵抗派也。</p>
<p>要之南洋各地綜國其趨勢。斐利賓獨立。暹羅强盛。緬甸安南均起革命。印度亦然。則將來趨勢必歸於組南洋聯邦有必然之勢。只時間問題耳。</p>
<p>穢俱相稱。聞在往年。收成豐稔之際。市集頗熱閙。今則連年荒旱農民十九俱呈菜色。市集大衰。蓋與軍事不無連帶關係也。</p>
<p>滁城有吾皖省立第九師範。校址在城西。頗富風景。校園内林木蒼鬱。淺草平蕪。惜絃誦久停。生徒星散。今則祗乘洋房數幢之殘骸耳。</p>
<p>愚一度至滁城區小學參觀。祗見學童俱俊秀可愛。惜現已改爲傷兵醫院矣。噫</p>

<p>法國秋季沙龍丨一九二九年ＳalondAutomne1929</p>
<p>（二）秋季沙龍的略史</p>
<p>只是幾年以後。秋季沙龍是已經風靡了當時大部分的歐人了的。竟將秋季沙龍的出品者當作偶像看的人們也很多。能夠出品秋季沙龍就是非常的榮譽。這是歐洲藝人的純正的憧憬。尤其是其中的許多大人物從不同的方面。各替新趨向開了公同的道路。絶不狹隘地淺薄地預立了派别來限制出品。只要你有好的東西清新的創作就得並列其間。它旣不是以篷挪Ｂonnaid或瑪諦斯Ｍatisse的畫做標準。又不是將梵鈍根ＶanDangen或瑪格Ｍarguai做主導。也不是指特朗Ｄerain蓋朗Ｇuerin任何一個人算重隨。乃是同時合起一切不相調和而有新生命的作家以反對那死的無聊的沉靡的藝術就是說對於官府的傳統的藝術的反叛。</p>
<p>從這裏說。是藝術上的轉變。整個的觀察起來。是思想上的轉變。現代人的生活終是向着「動」「活」的方面進行我們雖然自已不懂得。但我們終是向新的方面而活動。這是的確的、我們生着。我們終是向着未來的清新的希望進行。我們希望着前途的榮光的時代。所以我們就拚命要向「生」的方面走。默守傳統、安於不動的死的生活而相信維持現狀的人。已經是時代的落伍者。他是徒具軀殼而没有精神的了。也就等於已死的死人。所以現代的。眞的。有深味的藝術。必定是向关「動」的「活的」那裏進行。由創造的方面建立一種人生。不過在於藝術知識極端幼稚的中國。一輩鄙陋的人。他們何能懂得色的美。形的美。藝術内存生命和深奥的節奏。他們是以描頭畫角爲美的。以描寫歷史。傳說。或愛國的畫道德的畫算高尚的畫題。他們只知淺薄的外形。全不明白藝術的眞義。就是一般自命爲畫家的人也充滿着這般俗見。而以描寫死的外形崇拜官學派的末技而自以爲得意的。這等人替富人畫幾個肖像賺些錢也許可以。實在談不到現代的有價值的藝術、因爲他已經是徒具軀殼而無心靈的死人了。這種情形在法國自也不免。這樣俗陋的藝匠也很多。不過已經是棄入下流。拼於現代的藝壇之外了。</p>
<p>說話已稍越本題、現在言歸正傳罷。秋季沙龍是已經成爲現代藝壇的總組了。但是仍有那些鄙陋的俗見的人存着反對的態度。</p>
<p>秋季沙龍之能有如此的權威是受一位迪克推多之賜。他是以法蘭西共和國的那般嚴密的組織來組神聖的秋季沙龍。這位迭克推多就是一個狂人夏丹ＦrantzＪourdain</p>
<p>最奇怪的是兩個最顯著而取的權威的沙龍。都在迭克推多統馭之下、在歐洲没有人不知道夏丹把列寗和慕沙里泥的精神合於一身。來從事藝術的革命運動做新藝術的保護者。夏丹之爲秋季沙龍之會長也和西湼克ＰaulSignae之爲獨立展覽會ＳocietedeArtistesIndependato之會長一樣。他們的性格雖然不同。有時甚至極端相反。但是每人盡力保護一個沙龍的權威則是一樣的偉大。</p>
<p>秋季沙龍的歷史可以說是與它的迭克推多的歷史互相維繫。秋季沙龍之有今日以及將來的發展實以他的方量居多。</p>

<p>老乳傭居心叵測</p>
<p>馬戲園中美人計</p>
<p>王昌言被禁東廂</p>
<p>攫手槍嚇退羣匪</p>
<p>古鄞王懋賞、武夫也、王占元督鄂時、充十八師師長、王敗、解甲歸田、優游林下、儼然封翁、次子昌言、已婚、現年二十三、在滬研讀法學有年、今夏卒業、歸有期矣、顧以偶不謹愼、竟至失身匪窟、幾遭不測、而誘而綁之者、又爲服役多年之乳媪王於前晚十時遭綁、昨日下午二時出險、在匪手雖未及二十小時、然跡其前後遭遇、殊屬奇幻、實爲滬上綁匪案中之饒有興趣者、分述如次、</p>
<p>大少爺與乳媪相遇王昌言就讀於本埠法政大學、係通學生、自賃宿舍於金神父路新新里二百七十號、四星期前、游大世界、忽與乳媪潘金梅相遇、主僕相遇、均出不意、潘氏引身與王禮並口呼大小爺、今在滬上作何生活、王答在校讀書、現已畢業、即日返甬、潘氏唯唯者再、臨行告少主、以現居山海關路四百零七號、如有差遣、自當樂於奔命也、</p>
<p>時相過從識一男子王自遇潘媪後、即時以衣衫等送往洗滌、前後已有三四次之多、每往輙遇一男子、自稱姓高、名少谷、據媪言、係其近親、實則姘夫耳、王以媪故、不時假以詞色、前日傍晚王又前去、謂潘氏曰、在滬已無所事、摒擋行裝、即當返甬、明日行矣、汝亦願往一面舊東耶、潘答稱老身憚海行、不能侍少主行也、時高亦在旁、忽語王曰、如能於星期一（即今日）就程者、事諧矣、因余亦欲返鄕省親也、高慈谿人、王聆此言、即首肯、以爲多留滬上祗一二日、亦無妨也、</p>
<p>三人相將赴馬戲園高聞王言、延期啓行、若不勝其忻喜者、揚言多留上海兩日、正不妨暢遊一番、報載唯環馬戲園表演驚人、大有足觀、惜余終日碌碌、無福消受耳、所爲唯環馬戲者、正在卡德路口開演、王至潘媪處、輙經其地、心亦嚮往久矣、聞高言、不覺怦怦然、即言若媪與足下願往者、行耳於是三人相將而出赴馬戲園、</p>
<p>園中遇一倩裝女子王及潘媪與高三人入塲覓坐、忽覩一粲者在旁、潘氏忽顧女曰、汝亦在是耶、詞氣之間、似不期而遇者、實則餌耳、因亦引王與之介見、而潘則時以女事告王、且繩其美、戲畢且出、潘氏忽引裾謂王曰、伊寓離此不遠時未云宴、曷不一詣其居、高亦慫恿其行王無言、亦不置可否、乃同出僱人力車而往新閘路賡慶里、</p>
<p>入室後見形勢緊張至賡慶里時、已十時左右、視其居爲六八九號、衖衢修潔、不類鄙夫所居、王亦安之、且泰然焉、無何、相將登樓、進東廂、王忽見室中有糾糾者三四人、而陳設亦弗類善者居、王至是生疑、及聆室中人開口、不禁股標欲狂喊、而槍口已直抵胸脯、王知出聲、必且無悻、極力鎭靜、以覘其變、顧亦並無下文、祇令其安居勿聲耳、</p>
<p>彪形男子四人伴寢王居宿舍、獨睡已久、是夕室中忽多男子四人、爲之伴寢、殊覺弗慣、展轉返側、終夜未交睫、偶聞守視者言語、多不可領會、心知此身已爲潘媪所賣、幸旦四人、有倦意、更易兩人來、亦彪形大漢、王即身揷雙翅、亦不能飛去、且視其腰際、均有武器、益不敢作此想、</p>
<p>心生一計忽作假睡晌午進餐所陳飯菜、尚弗惡劣、飯後王倚榻作假寐、一匪亦下樓而去、室中乃祗有一人、繞榻蹀　、戒備甚嚴、王忽心生一計、作歸去想、因堅閉雙目、作沉睡狀、喉際呼呼然、一若熟睡、匪以爲飯後午睡、亦常事耳、意似稍弛忽小便甚急、亦弗暇離室、即以王所臥小榻旁之痰罐受洩、其動作雖似甚輕、而王固熟聞之、</p>
<p>眼明手快奪槍開發、匪因解洩、去腰間手槍、置之床沿、王眼明手快、一躍而起、顧骨碌間已爲匪驚覺、急棄痰罐奪門而出、王執槍在手、向之射擊、彈發凡三、而樓下之匪、已聞警奔返、樓頭對之開槍、幸倉猝間不能卒中、王終無恙、且大呼救命、聲巨而急、匪胆寒氣懾、急奔下樓、偕一女匪而遁、或云即王家乳媪潘金梅、</p>
<p>綁匪還擊彈傷婦人王呼警之聲及槍響、均聲聞户外、看衖之印捕、立即關閉栅門、往捕房告急、惟未知内情祗以盜警告捕頭、戈登路捕房立派中西幹探前去、爲時極速、然綁匪已乘此極短促之機會、從六八九號對面後户竄去並開槍示威、一婦人中流彈受傷、匪均安去無踪、</p>
<p>梯級上有血跡可尋戈登路捕房中西探捕趕到出事地點時、檢得彈壳數枚、散落地上、而梯級上又有血跡可尋、恐一匪受傷後始脫險也、旣入東廂、王已舉雙手待命、擊匪之槍、已横置案上、探等視王年約二十上下、身穿藍綢長袍、貌癯而神形間略帶驚惶之色、叩之、一書生耳、諸探聆其自述始末及擊匪圖逃、爲之嘆異、</p>
<p>二房東談租屋經過綁王之匪、雖兎脫一空、然捕房方面、正極力偵緝、據稱匪於十九日前往租屋、翌晨即遷入、且有眷屬、家用器具、亦弗過儉、屋主因未之疑、所略有不同者、即男子出入較多、旣非會親、亦非訪友、且登樓入室、不無啓疑之處、王昌言之被禁東廂、除匪外無知之者、其術亦過人哉、</p>

<h3 id="c185">文藝運動 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>發表之宣言</p>
<p>在本月初旬、有民族主義文藝運動者、在本埠某處集會並發表了宣言、引起文藝界的注意、兹覓得宣言原文刋錄如下、</p>
<p>中國民族主義文藝運動者於民國十九年六月一日、集會於上海、發表宣言如下、</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>中國的文藝界近來深深地陷入於畸形的病態的發展進程中、這種現象在稍稍留意於我國今日的藝壇及文壇的人必不會否認、在今日、當前的現象、正是中國文藝的危機、</p>
<p>我們試一看我們今日的文壇藝壇、我們便可以發現這種混雜的局面、我們會看見在這新文藝時代下、還竟有人在保持殘餘的封建思想、中國新文藝運動底歷史還不甚悠久其被一般所接受、雖已不能否認、但從新文藝運動發生以後、至於今日、因爲從事於新文藝運動的人對於文藝的中心意識底缺乏努力於形式的改革而忽略於内容的充實、致一切殘餘的封建思想、仍在那裏無形地支配一切這是無可諱言的、</p>
<p>同時我們看見那自名左翼的所謂無産階級的文藝運動、他們將藝術「呈獻給「勝利不然就死」的血腥的鬥爭」而以「……藝術不能不以無産階級在這黑暗的階級社會之「中世紀」裏面所感覺的感覺爲内容、……」同時、我們又看見那所謂左翼畫家結合底運動、在他們的宣言裏是、「諸君、請看那些拜金主義的畫家們、他們除了爲自已的名譽和黃金、除了爲自已的地盤與奢華的生活以外、從没有爲了我們謀利益吧、……青年美術家諸君、諸君應該認清他們的欺瞞和榨取是他們壓迫階級一貫的政策……」因此、在我們中國的舊文藝已傾圯、而新文藝建設底過程中却産生這類意識的階級的藝術運動、</p>
<p>在這樣的兩個極端的思想中、我們還可以看見許多形形式式的局面、每一個小組織、各擁有一個主觀的見解、因之、今日中國的新文壇藝壇上滿呈着零碎的殘局、在這樣的局面下、對文藝的中心意識遂致不能形成、所以自有新文藝運動以至今日、我們在新文藝上甚少成就、假如這種多型的文藝意識、各就其所意識到的去路而進展、則這種文藝上、紛擾的殘局永不會消失、其結果將致我們的新文藝運動永無發揮之日、而陷於必然的傾圮、當前的現象正是我們新文藝的危機、</p>
<p>但我們又如何而突破這個危機、使我們的新文藝運動演進至於燦爛輝煌之域、在前、我們認爲現下中國文藝底危機是由於多型的對於文藝底見解、而在整個新文藝發展底進程中缺乏中心的意識、因此突破這個當前的危機底唯一方法、是在努力於新文藝演進進程中底中心意識底形成、</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>藝術、從它的最初的歷史的紀錄上、已經明示了我們它所負的使命、我們很明瞭、藝術作品在原始狀態裏、不是從個人的意識裏産生而是從民族的立塲所形成的生活意識裏産生的、在藝術作品内所顯示的不僅是那藝術家的才能、技術、風格、和形式、同時、在藝術作品内顯示的也正是那藝術家所屬的民族底産物、這在藝術名上是很明顯地千訴了我們了</p>
<p>從那遼遠的古代藝術上、我們便可以看出藝術之民族的基礎、金字塔及人面獸之所以發現在埃及、因爲這種藝術是埃及的民族精神底展露、他們所顯示的正是埃及的民族意識、金字塔是墳墓建築、它之所以勃興、足以映示埃及人對於死人觀念的宗敎信仰、人面獸及其他的藝術形態、均是埃及民族宗敎底表示、希臘留下來的偉大的建築和彫刻、也正是希臘民族性底表示、因爲希臘民族有勇猛活潑的精神、有美麗强健的身體、有興奮熱烈的感情、有物質享樂的要求、有現世思想而非出世思想的宗敎觀與人生觀、有愛好運動的興趣、故在希臘藝術上所表現的正是希臘的民族精神、一般人所最易見到的維娜絲像、正足以反映希臘民族象徵人生底宗敎觀念、較普遍的鐵餅技手、也很明顯希臘人愛好運動底精神、在希臘藝術上、我們們看見希臘民族底充分展布、即使就是在中古世、在那政治不安定、充滿了地方的封建主義而缺乏民族意識的中古世紀、在當時所流行的建築彫刻和繪畫、也多少各有其民族底色彩、</p>
<p>藝術之民族色彩、益趨明顯、當中古的封建制度底漸漸傾圯之時、民族的意識愈見勃長、文藝復興的熱烈運動、其所以爲近代藝術開了端倪、便是它之從中古的峨特藝術底覊絆中、爲民族藝術底創造、由於它、我們看見文藝復興及其後的白羅克並羅哥哥藝術、都是新興的民族意識底顯露、</p>
<p>在文學上、文學之民族的要素、也和藝術一樣地存在着、文學的原始形態、我們現在雖則很難斷定其爲何如、但可以深信的、它必基於民族底一般的意識、這我們在希臘的伊里亞特和奥德中賽、日耳曼的尼貝龍根、英吉利的皮華而夫、法蘭西的羅蘭歌及我國的詩經國風上、很可以明瞭的、在西洋、民族文學底發展、必須有賴於支配拉丁語文底毁覆、及民族語文底行用、文藝復興時代之所以爲近代文學開了端倪、是因但丁及却塞各努力於把他們所屬民族底民族語文爲他們文學表現底手段、在英國、由於却塞底努力、我們看見有以利沙伯朝及其後底燦爛的文學時代、</p>
<p>以此我們很可以從這些藝術的紀錄上明瞭文藝的起源丨丨也就是藝術底最高的使命、是發揮它所屬的民族精神和意識、換一句說、文藝的最高意義、就是民族主義、</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>民族主義文藝底充分發展、一方面須賴於政治上的民族意識底確立一方面也直接影響於政治上民族主義的確立</p>
<p>就前者言民族文藝底充分發展必須有待於政治上的民族國家的建立、民族文藝底發展必伴隨以民族國家底産生所以我們在近代、看見民族文藝有充分的發皇、</p>
<p>自從一八一五年的維也納會議以後、歐州各處都充滿着民族主義的思想那個時候在歐州的地圖上還没有獨立的有德意志、意大利·匈牙利·波蘭·捷克斯拉夫·巨哥斯拉夫·及芬蘭等民族國家、所以在當時、民族主義的運動是非常澎湃、民族主義底目的、是在形成獨立的民族國家、匈牙利是在海斯堡鐵蹄之下、德意志充滿了封建制度的遺風、在同一民族之下、有許多小小的封建的郡主、意大利僅僅是一個地理上的名詞」、施綿尼ＳZechinye之流的匈牙利民族運動終於被海斯堡所征服、海斯堡帝國是當時歐州政局底覇主在他的主宰之下、有匈牙利有、神聖羅馬帝國所遺留下來的許多封建的郡主、所謂意大利的許多政治組織底單位、這種情形之下、努力於民族主義最烈的要推並魯士及薩丁尼亞、我們在這裏無須重復說明他們如何的奮鬥、至少自維也納會議以後、歐洲的民族已經認明他們唯一的出路是民族主義、他們開始向這個方向跑、這條路不是康莊大道、當然是崎嶇異常、</p>
<p>一八七一年是很可紀念的一年、在那一年不但是法國被德國打敗得狼狽不堪、他之所以以可紀念、是歐洲民族主義運動底成功德意志自一八一五年以後、就認明這條民族主義的道路、因爲小的那主太多、不能不推出普魯士來做他們民族主義運動的首領結果便是德意志民族國家底建立、</p>
<p>一八七一年之所以值得紀念還有意大利民族底産生、雖則意大利在這年前已經有民族國家底産生、但那時羅馬還在法國的佔領之下、普法戰爭底結果、便是在羅馬佔領中的法國軍隊底召回、使民族的意大利國、得以奠都於羅馬丨意大利的必然的首都、</p>
<p>自一八七一年以後、日耳曼人及意大利人雖則實現了他們的民族運動、但歐洲的民族運動便不因此而停止、巴爾斡問題自柏林會議以後、一直到現在不曾有滿意各方的解决、而爲戰爭醖釀的原因、便是在該處的民族運動、同時、屈伏於海斯堡下的斯拉夫民族、自一八七一年後便開始有政治的民族運動一直到一九一四丨一九一八年以後的歐戰、才現實了他們的企圖、歐戰底結果、我們看見有更多民族國家底産生、和兩大帝國底崩圮在海斯堡鐵蹄下的斯拉夫民族實現了他們的企望、我們看見有巨哥斯拉夫、捷克斯洛夫基亞等民族國家底建立、</p>
<p>一九一七年十一月俄羅斯革命的結果、我們不但看見羅門諾夫帝國主義底傾覆、並且同時看見民族主義更多的成功、不但是芬蘭·波蘭·拉維亞·立陶宛及愛松尼亞等民族、都已挣開了俄羅斯的覊絆而建立獨立的民族國家、並且、我們看見烏克蘭白俄羅斯南高加索、突厥和烏兹貝克各民族、都建立自主的民族國家、即俄羅斯社會主義蘇維埃聯邦共和國、也是由十一個自主國和十二個自主州所組成、於此足見民族主義的力量是恒久的偉大、</p>
<p>最近像中國的國民革命土耳其共和國的建立、愛爾蘭的自由運動、菲律賓獨立的運動、朝鮮·印度·越南的獨立運動、更充滿了民族運動的紀錄故近代文藝因此也滿呈着民族主義底運動誠如政治上的出路的民族主義、故文藝發展底出路也集中於民族主義、</p>
<p>現代法蘭西的藝術、最初的一名運動員是塞尚奈、他將當時流行於法國的各派藝術底主張、如印象派光的現象的注重、殷格萊Ｉngres底畫的萬有說、和柯爾貝Ｃourbert底實際論、總合起來而加添了他自已獨創的主張丨所謂自我的表現和綫的形式的注重、演成所謂後來的立體主義、及野獸運動Ｆauves及最後演進於所謂「純粹主義」在這多種多樣的藝術界中、中心意識、却還只是一個就是法蘭西的民族意識</p>
<p>在德國、德國人另有他的民族藝術、他們的運動集中於表演主義底旗幟之下、所謂表現主義、是日耳曼民族底民族精神、及民族意識底表露、故表現主義尤其富於濃厚的民族特徵、誠如的令頓敎授ＰrofBrinton所言「日耳曼人的現代藝術是所謂表現主義、滿呈了日耳曼的民族特徵、」</p>
<p>此外、意大利人對於民族藝術的努力是集中於未來主義、俄羅斯人對於民族藝術底努力是集中於原始主義、這種主義都是他們民族精神及民族意識底表露、如前所述、我們很可以明瞭、文藝底進展隨着政治底進展、故民族文藝底確立、必有待於民族國家底建立、</p>
<p>就後者言、文藝上的民族運動直接影響及於政治上民族主義底確立、這我們在巨哥斯拉夫底發展上是很明瞭的、巨哥斯拉夫底民族藝術運動較巨哥斯拉夫民族國家底誕生爲先、巨哥斯拉夫底民族藝術運動集中於麥司屈洛維克Ｍestnovic、一九零五年成立底南斯拉夫藝術家聯盟、是巨哥斯拉夫民族藝術具體的組織的活動底開端、他們集中他們表現於南斯拉夫民族底歷史的烈風和其民族的意志、由於巨哥斯拉夫民族藝術的確立、我們在歐戰後就看見有巨哥斯拉夫民族國家底出現、</p>
<p>藝術和文學、因之必須以民族爲其基礎、這事實是不容否認的了、但是民族主義的文藝所包含的内容又是什麽呢、</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>民族是一種人種的集團、這種人種的集團底形成、决定於文化的、歷史的、體質的及心理的共同點、過去的共同奮鬥、是民族形成唯一的先决條件、繼續的共同奮鬥、是民族生存進化唯一的先决條件、因之、民族主義的目的、不僅消極地在乎維繫那一羣人種底生存、並積極地發揮那一羣人底力量和增長那一羣人底光輝、</p>
<p>藝術和文學是屬於某一民族的、爲了某一民族的、並由某一個民族産生的、其目的不僅在表現那所屬民族底民間思想、民間宗敎、及民族的情趣、同時在排除一切阻礙民族進展的思想、在促進民族的向上發展底意志、在表現民族在增長自已的光輝底進程中一切奮鬥的歷史、因之、民族主義的文藝、不僅在表現那已經形成的民族意識、同時、並創造那民族底新生命、</p>
<p>屬於第一義的民族藝術、表現民族的情趣、我們看見有現代德意志的表現主義、俄羅斯的原始主義、及法蘭西的純粹主義、</p>
<p>屬於第二義的民族藝術、我們看見有意大利的未來主義及巨哥斯拉夫的現代藝術、未來主義的中心意識、在物質或機械文明的贊楊、我們看到意大利在西洋是物質文明落後的國家、唯其如此、所以未來主義出現於意大利、以創造意大利民族對于物質文明底意識、巨哥斯拉夫的民族藝術、在麥司屈洛維克ＩvanＭestrovic領導之下、不僅表現了他們民族的過去的奮鬥、並努力於南斯拉夫人民族國家底意識底建立、</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>現今我們中國文壇藝壇底當前的危機是在對於文藝缺乏中心意識、那末、我們要突破這個危機、並促進我們的文藝底開展、勢必在形成一個對於文藝底中心意識、從歷史的敎訓、我們須集中我們此後的努力於民族主義的文學與藝術底創造、我們此後的文藝活動、應以我們的喚起民族意識爲中心、同時、爲促進我們民族的繁榮、我們須促進民族的向上發展的意志、創造民族的新生命、我們現在所負的、正是建立我們的民族主義文學與藝術重要偉大的使命、</p>

<p>這個好消息、已徧載六月十八日、本埠各大報的敎育新聞欄内、現在爲本文得一根據起見、照錄報載消息於後、</p>
<p>「上海金神父路上海法政學院、（原名上海法政大學）自鄭毓秀朱佛定兩博士主持辦理後、竭力規劃、日見發展、最近經國府敎育部批准立案、現該校爲培植人才起見、在本屆畢業生中、挑選成績優異者五人、留學法國、内女生三名、男生二名、下屆則擬增加至十名、或十五名云」不差、這並不是法政學院的擴大宣傳、事實確是如此、我們眞好幸福、前途重要關係的立案問題、經鄭朱兩博士多方努力的結果、終於是由敎育部核准了、不但學校立了案、同學們似乎得了光明的出路、而且當局還要派送學生赴法留學、這尤其使同學們有了特殊的希望、可是據傳出來的消息說、這次派送留法的五人、不須經過考試甄拔的手續、早已由當局内定了、於是同學們都在紛紛議論着、有的說法政學院本屆畢業的二百人、女生不過佔十之二、而派送留法者、男二而女三、非學校當局之重女輕男、即女同學之成績、特别優異於男同學、於是、長了女同學的志氣、滅了男同學的威風、有的說、派送留學生、而不組織考試委員會、鄭重考選眞才、恐生樹植私黨之流弊、而違培植人才之目的、於是對這問題、不免懷疑起來、</p>
<p>而且事實又是這樣、據確知内幕者說、此次派送留法之三女士、一爲張師竹、一爲章粹吾、於是、同學們的議論更多了、有的說、張、章兩女士、都係本屆法律系專門部畢業、論資格、論學識、難道四五十個本科畢業生、都比不上她倆麽、有的說她倆成績優異與否、姑且不論、不過她倆因爲入了專門部、照章不讀外國語、所以都不懂法文、學校當局不派送照章必修過四年法文的本科畢業生、而偏派送不懂法文的張章兩女士、這好似和她倆在開頑笑了、</p>
<p>以上各方的議論、雖似言之成理、然而、終究書生之見、不切時務、我想同學們不應如此健忘吧、本年春間、學校發生逐長風潮、大勢岌岌、不可終日、如天之幸、賴有張師竹女士、出任學生全體大會的臨時主席、並由章粹吾女士担任大會紀錄、這樣一來、學生的勢力、對立起來、少數把持學生會的分子、就形軟化了、而逐長風潮、就得安然而過、使當時設有張章兩女士的努力、恐法政學院、早已物是人非、那裏還有今日的立案功成、慶祝昇平呢、論功行賞、張章兩女士的被派送留學、實屬當之無愧的了、而且、現在張章兩女土、不是天天早晚在「啊、盤、衰、檯」的念着法文麽、（劍）</p>

<p>Chen Cheng's Troops Capture Pinggang and Guoba</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Military News: After Liu Zhi's troops captured Qixian, they combined forces and advanced. The vanguard is closing in on Chenliu, and Kaifeng is wavering. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Xuzhou Headquarters News: Received a telegram from Chen Cheng dated the 16th, stating that his troops advanced this morning. The newly organized First Division of the enemy Sun Liangcheng's force resisted along the Pinggang-Guoba line. His troops attacked in two directions: the left route captured Pinggang, and the right route captured Guoba, completely resolving the enemy. They captured enemy Brigade Commander Guo Qingyuan, who was disguised as a woman, and seized a large number of enemy soldiers and weapons. They are continuing their advance. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Capital Garrison Command announced, according to reports: (1) The enemy on the Longhai Railway front, after being repeatedly struck hard by our army, built more fortifications and stubbornly resisted, hoping to conserve strength to strike later. Unexpectedly, our army changed its strategy and began maneuvering, advancing rapidly and steadily. Our army fiercely fought the rebel forces of Sun Liangcheng and Zhang Ge's divisions at Xiaozai, Yougang, Changgang, Huaigang, and Qixian for two days and nights. The enemy ran out of ammunition and had no reinforcements, suffering heavy casualties and retreating in disarray. In this battle, over 10,000 enemy officers and soldiers were captured, along with over 7,000 rifles, 15 field guns, 27 heavy mortars, and 38 machine guns. Both rebels, Sun and Ji, were severely wounded, and rebel Ji died en route from a bullet wound to the chest. Currently, our army's vanguard has surpassed the north of Tongxu County and is advancing straight towards the main road to Kaifeng. The rebel enemy, hearing the news, wavered along the entire line and collapsed. Recapturing Kaifeng is imminent. Rebels Feng and Lu, seeing that the situation was hopeless, secretly met in Kaifeng at night, weeping together. (2) At 3 AM, the rebel enemy under Ma launched a fierce attack on our army at Lujiazhuang, northwest of Guide Town in Changqing, but were bravely repulsed by our army.

<p>Foreign Ministry Has Not Yet Received British Minister's Reply</p>
<p>Tianjin Consular Body to Hold Further Meeting Today</p>
<p>Symons Maintains Customs Operations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Tianjin Customs incident, the Tianjin consular body jointly telegraphed Inspector General of Customs Maze, proposing that during this period, all foreign merchant ships exporting from or importing into Tianjin should have their customs procedures handled temporarily by the consulates. Maze found it difficult to immediately accept or reject this proposal and stated that he must at least consult with British Minister Lampson before making a decision. The Chinese side considers the measures proposed by the Tianjin consular body to be strange and believes that this incident can test whether Britain can handle the actions of its nationals who are attached to rebel friendly countries in accordance with public law and whether various countries intend to undermine the system of the National Government. Because the Chinese Maritime Customs has more responsibility shouldered by the British, they are directly responsible to the Chinese government, and because customs duties bear foreign debt, the United Kingdom also bears considerable responsibility to the relevant countries. Since the Foreign Ministry issued a note, Lampson has returned to Peiping from Beidaihe and is consulting with the envoys of various countries to China. As of now, there has been no response to the Foreign Ministry's note. However, the Chinese authorities, considering this matter to be of great importance, have telegraphed Lampson, requesting him to come south immediately to discuss the matter. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This newspaper's reporter met with a Foreign Ministry official on the evening of the 22nd and inquired about: (1) Reports that various countries will implement acting on behalf of the Tianjin Customs affairs, and Japan has already done so. How will China respond? He replied that there was no such thing. (2) Has China received a response to its note to the British Minister? He replied that there was no response yet. (3) Is it true that the Foreign Ministry has telegraphed the British Minister to come south to discuss the Tianjin Customs matter? He replied that it had not. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Tianjin consular body is scheduled to hold another meeting on the 23rd to discuss how to deal with the customs issue. The French and Italian consuls advocate that since the Tianjin Customs is closed, goods should be imported duty-free as a free port or registered by the consuls for future payment. Britain and Japan have received instructions from their governments that taxes must be paid as usual, regardless of who they are paid to, as decided by the consuls. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Tianjin authorities plan to arrest Belles as an opportunity to punish those who disrupt public order. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) British Minister Lampson has not yet received official documents regarding the Foreign Ministry's request to exile Symons. He will consider it after the documents arrive. Lampson only said that Symons's excessive talking invited trouble. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Su Tiren returned to Peiping this afternoon because Tianjin Customs has started operations, and the customs matter has come to a small conclusion. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is heard that the consular corps convened a meeting yesterday, and only discussed the Tianjin Customs issue without making any important resolutions. The current situation is that each consulate has agreed with the customs that for all ships exporting, the ship's manifest will be issued by the consulate of its respective country. Symons declared that he intends to complete the reorganization of customs affairs today and place the new customs officers. His first purpose is to facilitate merchants and make it easier to transport goods. As for the collection of customs duties, it is still secondary. Symons also said that he intends to hire some foreign employees who have previously been involved with customs to serve as department heads, calling them emergency personnel. He has already received many letters of application. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e7">The Desolate Scene of Japan's Finances <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Japan, due to the decline of commerce, has seen its securities plummet, affecting the shipping industry and causing it to stagnate. It has affected the railways, leading to the dismissal of staff. It has affected the public sector, causing Tokyo to be stretched thin, and the museum to be bleak and empty. However, I believe that this is only the first step. The stagnation of commerce is only a matter of a few months, and the stagnation that follows, it is unknown when it will be restored. The desolation due to poverty in the future is unknown. I also believe that Japan is the first industrial and commercial nation to encounter this situation. If commerce remains stagnant for a long time, then all countries established on industry and commerce will follow Japan's lead in every aspect.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, the so-called strong countries of today are all strong because of wealth. The so-called wealthy countries of today are all wealthy because of industry and commerce. When industry flourishes, commerce naturally flourishes. Now, because industry has flourished excessively, the world market cannot absorb the goods produced, and as a result, commerce declines due to industry. This is a fact, not created by any one time or place. Therefore, the fate of commercial decline in the future is not something that can be remedied by any one time or place. Therefore, the misfortune suffered by commercial decline today cannot be stopped today. Nor can it be stopped as easily as today's misfortune. Looking at the world broadly, it is not known whether it will gradually move towards equality or gradually become chaotic because of this.</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The new customs superintendent of Tianjin Customs, Symons, told reporters on the 22nd that the shipping companies do not recognize the new seal, and that the old seal has now been found by opening the safe. In the future, customs declarations and tax payments will be based on this seal. The Tanggu Port Authority has also gone on strike, and ships cannot enter the port. The Kailuan Mining Bureau has been asked to send personnel to hang lights and flags. The Chinese employees will be given three days to reconsider starting from the 23rd, and their salaries will be paid on the 23rd. It is expected that they will return. The foreign employees intend to sabotage, and I have decided not to use any of them. I have now promoted Zhu Lianju, a second-class patrolman, to chief inspector and assigned Englishman Karl and Japanese Nakke to handle accounting and paperwork. The postal parcels are expected to return to normal in another week. The Tianjin Customs Superintendent, Ge Jingyou, received a telegram from Yan on the 22nd, assigning him to concurrently handle the affairs of the Chang Customs. Bi Luo, the director of the Chang Customs, has handed over the seals and keys. Ge is scheduled to take office on the 23rd, but it is not yet known whether the old employees will return to work.

<p>Shuang Qing's Negotiations in Germany Successfully Completed</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The contract between the Ministry of Communications and the German Lufthansa for the development of Sino-European aviation was originally scheduled to be held in February, but because Lufthansa's headquarters had to study the contents of the contract, they were still hesitant. Previously, Shuang Qing, a counsellor dispatched by the Ministry of Communications, explained everything during his inspection tour of Europe. When the German industrial delegation was in Beijing, they inquired about everything and promised to fully assist, so that China and Germany would benefit. Now that Shuang Qing has arrived in Germany, the negotiations have been successful, and Lufthansa will send personnel to China to inspect the routes and flight facilities. It is expected that the original contract will be fulfilled or revised soon. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Most of the Sino-American aviation contract has been completed.

The arrangements for personnel administration and the organization of the board of directors are all based on this percentage, and the reorganization is based on our company's regulations. As for the bonds that our side previously signed and paid to the United States each month due to the restrictions of the previous contract, which was a key point of contention in the negotiations between the two sides, it is now heard that a principle has been agreed upon: the bonds signed and paid by our side will be used as our country's new capital, and the bonds received by the US side will also be used as US capital. In the future, they may be offset against each other, or one of them may be chosen. The signing can be decided this week. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Xu Shiying said that the recent disaster relief is divided into two aspects: short-term and long-term. For the short-term, it is planned to levy 5 million yuan from customs duties, but later the foreigners used the customs agreement as an excuse and refused to follow it. He then went to Peiping in person and negotiated with the diplomatic corps. As a result, the diplomatic corps believed that if proper procedures were used, it could be levied. It is currently being negotiated. For the long-term, it is planned to ask the Ministry of Finance to allocate 5 million yuan annually to serve as a disaster prevention fund. Except for emergency relief, no funds may be used at all. This case should be made so that there will never be any changes. It has been submitted to the National Government and approved for review by the Legislative Yuan. It can be passed this week. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>

The remaining ones were escorted back to the Chinese boundary by the British soldiers. The Foshan ship was delayed for one hour because of this. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd -- The Finance Minister attended the People's Government Standing Headquarters Party Political Affairs Research Council yesterday afternoon, and gave a general speech on the current financial situation and countermeasures as follows: Providing stopgap relief for the decline of the financial and business worlds will only leave behind the seeds of disaster. Therefore, there is only one path: fundamental reorganization. In this autumn of worldwide decline, neither the government nor the people should panic. They should strive to enrich the content, which is most essential. One cannot depart from concrete facts and merely be terrified and helpless. The government is currently determined to reorganize industries and businesses. Once the reorganization is complete, this terror and agitation will naturally disappear. Those involved in such reorganization should first awaken themselves. The government has no other choice but to resolutely intervene in private businesses and reorganize them. Tightening policy is one of the important platforms of the cabinet. The government has not considered changing its tightening policy in the slightest.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 21st -- A group of Japanese financial giants, including Dan and Go, planned to request the government to enrich measures to relieve the recession, stop submitting the Labor Union Law, and ease the tightening policy. They went to the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 AM today to request a meeting with Prime Minister Hamaguchi. For some reason, they were refused by Hamaguchi. Dan and Go requested to visit again the day after tomorrow, but Hamaguchi did not allow it. The general public criticized Hamaguchi for putting on a show of "bright politics" while displaying such bureaucratic airs.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd -- Due to the impact of the global shipping industry's decline, the Japanese Mail Steamship Company has already implemented measures such as changing the vessels in service and suspending services. Eight vessels have already been suspended.</p>

It has already requested a loan of 4 million yen from a banking syndicate. ▲ Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd -- The new museum built in Ueno Park at a cost of 2 million yen has no money to purchase curtains due to the impact of the government's tightening policy. Although exhibits have been transported there, there are no shelves to display them. The surroundings are bare and desolate. There is no certainty when it can be opened to the public.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 22nd -- On Tuesday, Conservative members of Parliament and candidates will meet at the Carlton Club. Baldwin will speak on the Conservative Party's policies. After the speech, the meeting will be asked to decide whether Baldwin or Beaverbrook should be the leader of the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd -- Leaders of the Imperial Free Trade Movement within the Conservative Party are now making critical remarks about Baldwin's appointment as party leader. Therefore, the Conservative Party has scheduled a meeting for Tuesday to discuss the party leader issue. It has been seven years since such a meeting was held. Today's main point of contention is Baldwin's attitude toward the Imperial Free Trade Party platform, and the food tax issue is particularly the focus. A few days ago, in order to reconcile, Baldwin accommodated the suggestion of Lord Beaverbrook, leader of the Imperial Free Trade Party, and was willing to submit any contractual issues related to food taxes agreed upon by the special imperial conference to a national referendum. At the same time, he repeatedly stated that the food tax would not be included in the Conservative Party platform in the upcoming general election. The Imperial Free Trade Party believes this statement contains hostility. Therefore, Lord Beaverbrook disclosed a letter in the Daily Mail on Tuesday, stating that the Imperial Free Trade Movement could not expect the support of the Conservative Party's leading figures, and requested Conservative Party members to donate funds so that candidates could be recommended separately in constituencies that do not actively support Imperial Free Trade.</p>
<h3 id="e46">The Misfortune of the Nanyang Chinese Newspaper <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Three Ordered to Cease Publication</p>
<p>June 7, Penang -- May is a month of national humiliation that our country can lament and sing about, and also a commemorative month for the surging tide of our country's national revolution. Who would have thought that in this month of May, the Chinese newspapers of the Malay Peninsula would be ordered to cease publication by the local government in as many as three cases due to textual issues? The Singapore Republic Daily was only published on New Year's Day of this year, but it was able to do its best to promote the party and the country. During the commemoration of the "May Third" massacre, the newspaper published a bloody article on Jinan, which the Nanyang Daily News, published by the Japanese in Nanyang, regarded as "extremely thick with anti-Japanese agitation." It raised a rebuttal, ending with "a request for the authorities to take action and a request for the consul to lodge a protest." As expected, the Republic Daily was heard to be ceasing publication for two months within a few days. After the news of the Republic Daily's cessation of publication spread, the Nanyang newspaper industry was saddened and encouraged. Therefore, on various commemorative days in May, there was propaganda similar to that of the Republic Daily. As a result, the Guanghua Daily and the Nanyang Times in Penang also ceased publication following the Republic Daily. The misfortune suffered by the Nanyang newspaper industry has never been greater than this. The Guanghua Daily has a considerable history in Penang. This time, the order limited its cessation of publication to three months starting from May 29th. The Nanyang Times did not state a deadline for its cessation of publication. If it is an indefinite cessation of publication, then one less Chinese newspaper in Penang. The reasons for the cessation of publication have not been announced. The procedures for ceasing publication here are very easy and simple. All Nanyang printing businesses, regardless of size, must report to the government, which issues licenses before operations can begin. Therefore, to stop a newspaper's publication, all that is needed is to take back the license, and naturally it cannot be published.</p>

<p>Important News: Hubei Finance Department Requests</p>
<h3 id="e54">Central Government to Allocate Funds to Offset Land Tax Losses <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Before Secure Guarantees are Obtained</p>
<p>Unified Tax Not Yet Ready to be Under Central Government Jurisdiction</p>
<p>The Hubei Finance Department presented to the Ministry of Finance: Upon review, the total expenditure budget of Hubei Province for the 18th year is 30,087,000 yuan, and the total revenue budget is 17,940,000 yuan. The difference between income and expenditure is a shortfall of 12,920,000 yuan. Even based on the situation in the current year, the actual expenditure requires more than 1,700,000 yuan per month, and the actual income averages around 1,200,000 yuan per month. The actual shortfall is more than 500,000 yuan per month. The unified tax revenue in the 17th year was 11,350,000 yuan, averaging more than 940,000 yuan per month, accounting for more than 73% of the total tax revenue. In the nine months of the 19th year, it was more than 7,200,000 yuan, averaging 800,000 yuan per month, also accounting for 70% of the total. Other tax revenues average only 300,000 yuan per month, accounting for only about 30% of the total. Recently, due to the establishment of district offices in various counties, the raising of security corps, and the increase in temporary expenses for suppressing bandits, the increase has been quite large. Together with the original expenses, the total monthly expenditure is more than 1,990,000 yuan. All of these are necessary expenditures, and all rely on the unified tax revenue to supplement them. Therefore, all expenditures in Hubei Province are closely related to the unified tax revenue. However, the abolition of inland tax is a well-established policy of the central government and should be actively pursued. Since receiving the order to abolish inland tax on October 10, the Finance Department has organized a Committee for Deliberating on Offsetting Inland Tax Losses to specifically discuss the issue of offsetting. We should follow the two plans that the Ministry of Finance had established when preparing to abolish inland tax in the 17th year. One was to establish a special consumption tax to directly compensate for the loss of inland tax. The other was to formulate a general outline for business tax for each province to implement, which implicitly intended to compensate for the loss of local inland tax after its abolition. However, there are some questions about these two plans. Regarding the special consumption tax, although the resolution of the central inland tax abolition conference has the meaning that it can be handled by the Finance Department on behalf of the Ministry, Hubei's unified tax revenue is mainly derived from transit goods, and local production is extremely limited. The items for which a special consumption tax can be implemented are limited. Although there is no detailed prediction at present, the general situation is that only cotton can be considered. The amounts of miscellaneous grains and tea are already small, and there is nothing else to list. The low amount of tax revenue in the future can be foreseen, and there is no ability to offset the unified tax. Regarding the business tax, the essence of Hubei Province is only the town of Hankou. Hankou has now established a special municipal government. If it is to be implemented, the collection and jurisdiction must first be determined by the central government before it can proceed, otherwise there will be no result. Other places are small rural gatherings, and how much income can there be, and it is very difficult to proceed, and it cannot be started in the shortest period of time. Using it to offset the unified tax is truly slim. In addition, regarding the land tax, Hubei's land tax revenue in recent years has been only 800,000 to 900,000 yuan, and it has value for reorganization. The fundamental solution in the future is none other than this. However, Hubei's land tax registers were destroyed without remainder after the Hong Yang Rebellion. To reorganize, a thorough land survey is necessary. However, a land survey cannot be completed in a few years or even ten years. During its implementation, not only will there be no increase in tax revenue, but there will also be a large amount of expenditure. It is even more insufficient to talk about offsetting. Even if other miscellaneous taxes and public assets are reorganized to the best of their ability, they cannot obtain one-tenth of the unified tax revenue. For months, after repeated research and deliberation, it is impossible to obtain a good strategy for offsetting in Hubei Province. Although inland tax is a bad tax system, the proposal to abolish inland tax arose from seeking an increase in tariffs. Since the implementation of the seven-level transitional tariff system on February 1 of the 18th year, which is the period of preparing to abolish inland tax, the revenue in one year was more than 152.76 million taels, an increase of more than 70 million taels compared to the revenue of more than 82.33 million taels in the 17th year. This increase is the result of preparing to abolish inland tax. In the future, when inland tax is abolished and the autonomous new tariff is implemented at the same time, its increase can be predicted. Therefore, there is an extremely direct cause-and-effect relationship between abolishing inland tax and increasing tariffs. The loss of inland tax should be allocated from the increased tariff revenue, which is an immutable request in principle. Therefore, the resolution of the first inland tax abolition conference stated that when inland tax, which was originally collected by local authorities, is transferred to the central government, the central government should allocate it in full amount to offset it. From this, it can be seen that while the central government is determined to abolish inland tax and transfer it to the central government for convenience, it also takes into account local realities and acknowledges providing full assistance. The Finance Department's research results, based on the above two reasons and the meaning of the central government assisting local deficiencies in the Party platform, specifically request that the Ministry of Finance provide secure allocation within the scope of national taxes according to the amount of unified tax revenue listed in the telegram for the 18th year, and propose three plans for adoption: (1) Transfer the salt tax surcharge to Hubei Province for collection. The salt tax surcharge was originally provincial revenue, but was later transferred to the central government due to military expenses. Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hunan, and other provinces all have salt tax surcharges. Hubei plans to follow the example and request that it still be transferred to the province for collection, which can obtain more than 6 million yuan per year. (2) The Finance Department will try to implement a special consumption tax. The Finance Department has absolutely no preconceived notions about handling the consumption tax, but in order to facilitate the change, it can also try to implement it on behalf of the Ministry. The amount of revenue cannot be predicted and should be the actual revenue used as the offsetting amount. (3) If the above two items are insufficient to offset the original unified tax revenue, the central government should allocate the full amount from the increased tariff revenue. Hubei's financial expenses are so closely related to the unified tax. Before the Ministry of Finance has clearly designated offsetting tax funds and obtained guarantees, this unified tax seems impossible to transfer to the Ministry of Finance. The matter concerns the overall interests of the country and the local area. I have specially presented the detailed situation to Your Excellency. I request that you consider and implement it.</p>

<p>Chen Shaokuan's Report to the Executive Yuan and General Headquarters</p>
<p>Chen Shaokuan, acting Minister of the Navy, directed the Hunan support fleet to attack Zhang Gui, successively recovering the areas along Chang and Yue. Chen has now reported the circumstances of the successive battles to the Executive Yuan and the General Headquarters. The following is a transcript of the report: "I received reports from various sources in late May that the remnants of Meng Gui had fled to Hunan, spying on Wuhan, intending to disrupt the rear. I immediately dispatched the Chu Tai, Shun Sheng ships to cruise around Changsha and Yuezhou, creating a sound to deter the enemy from attacking by water, and to prevent them from daring to fight along the river, so that our Fourth Route Army could calmly cross the river to the west. On the 3rd of this month, according to the Chu Tai ship report, the Fourth Route Army plans to temporarily abandon Changyue and others. Shaokuan rushed to transfer the Xian Ning, which was stationed in Yichang, and the Gong Sheng, which was stationed in Jianli, to the Dongting Lake Xiangjiang area. Along with the Chu Tai, Shun Sheng, and other ships, they guarded the Fourth Route Army team, which was crossing the river at Yuezhou, Chenglingji, and Linxiang, and blocked the enemy from tailing in the upper reaches. Shaokuan also rushed to the front line to command on the 4th at 9:00 PM, leading the Chu You ship from Ning to the upper reaches. He dispatched the Wei Sheng and Jiang Kun ships to guard the Jiujiang, Wuxue, Qichun, and Huangshigang areas, to suppress the communists to prevent the interruption of Jiangji traffic. The Jiang Yuan, Min Quan, and De Sheng ships protected Wuhan to reassure the people. Yi Sheng shuttled between Wuhan and Chengyue to take care of transportation. Shaokuan arrived in Han on the 6th at 7:00 PM and contacted Director He of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Headquarters to discuss everything. On the 7th, he traveled to Xindou to patrol and defend along the way, and learned that the enemy had fled from Changsha towards Yuezhou Chenglu Ji. Shaokuan then led the Chu You ship to Yuezhou at dawn on the 8th to prepare to meet the enemy. Earlier, the Gong Sheng ship cruised around the Lulinze area of Xiangyin on the 7th and guarded the Fourth Route Army team across Dongting Lake from the Deer Horn Crossing. Returning to Yue on the evening of the 8th, and dispatched the Shun Sheng ship into Changsha on the same day, using artillery to sweep and attack the enemy. The enemy was greatly shocked to see our ship suddenly appear on the Changsha River. The ship severely swept the enemy along the way in Tongguan Jinggang Xiangyin and other places, and captured twenty rebels crossing the river, and one squad leader. The Xian Ning ship arrived from the downstream at 9:00 AM on the 9th, and launched a second attack on Changsha. The enemy had now deployed troops and artillery positions along the coast of Yingtian. As the ship passed this place, it engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy for about an hour, destroying its positions and artillery positions. The enemy then fled. The ship returned to Yuezhou in the evening. Shaokuan led the Chu You ship to Xindi at 7:00 PM to deploy defenses, and dispatched the Yi Sheng ship to Linxiang and the Cheng Sheng ship to Chenglingji, guarding our army across the river. The Gong Sheng ship was stationed in Xindi. At dawn on the 10th, Shaokuan led the Chu You ship to patrol Jiayu Jinkou and other places, and went to Han to discuss the combat plan with Director He. On the same day, the Fourth Route Army had completely crossed the river. After the ships completed their guarding tasks, they went to Xindi Linxiang to prevent the enemy from crossing the river, and to add coal and food. At dawn on the 11th, Shaokuan led the Chu You ship on patrol from Han, and dispatched the Min Quan ship to guard Jinkou, the Xian Ning ship to Xiaojiazhou, the Shun Sheng ship to Jiayu, to prevent the enemy from fleeing across the river from Pingjiang to Han. The Yi Sheng ship attacked the enemy fiercely all day long in the Chenglingji Yuezhou area. When the ship patrolled to the Nanjin Port in the upper reaches of Yuezhou, it saw the rebels advancing in formation on the railway bridge, so it opened fire. The enemy had no place to escape in a hurry. They were severely hit head-on, and many were killed or injured. Shaokuan patrolled back to Xindi in the evening. On the 12th, the Chu Tai and Cheng Sheng ships went to Chengyue to continue attacking the enemy. The Chu You and Gong Sheng ships remained in Linxiang Xindi, while the Xian Ning and Shun Sheng ships patrolled the Jiayu Xiaojiazhou area. On the 13th, Shaokuan attacked the enemy fiercely in the Linxiang Chengyue area, still leading the Chu You and Yi Sheng ships, at dawn. Although the enemy fought back with guns and artillery, their ferocity was frustrated, and they gradually became unsustainable. On that night, the rebels retreated from Chenglingji. By dawn on the 14th, the area was occupied by our ships, and continued to advance towards Yuezhou. At noon, Yueyang was recaptured. Shaokuan led the Chu You, Chu Tai, Yi Sheng ships to Chengyue to guard and maintain order on that evening, restoring local order. After the Cheng Sheng ship arrived in Yuezhou, it pursued the enemy along Dongting Lake. The Shun Sheng ship also patrolled from Jiayu overnight. At dawn on the 15th, Shaokuan led the Chu You and Shun Sheng ships towards Changsha, successively recovering Yingtian Lulin Tan Xiangyin Jinggang and other places along the way. On that evening, the Shun Sheng and Cheng Sheng ships rushed to Sanyouji near Changsha to observe the enemy's situation. On the morning of the 16th, Shaokuan led the Chu You, Shun Sheng, and Cheng Sheng ships to attack the Changsha Railway Bridge Xinhou area. They happened to meet the enemy stationed in Chengyue who had just retreated there, so they severely suppressed them. The enemy was greatly disheartened by the daily sweeping of our ships and dared not advance in formation, so they fled in confusion, escaping into the fields, and fled far away under the cover of darkness. The Hu J隼 ship also arrived at this time. On the 17th, the enemy in Changsha suddenly increased the number of returnees from Chengyue, and the artillery positions were also encrypted. Shaokuan was afraid that it would spread, so at dawn on that day, he led the Chu You, Shun Sheng, and Cheng Sheng ships to continue attacking. The enemy's artillery shells were dense, and the Shun Sheng chimney parts were damaged. The ships increased their fierce attacks. In the evening, the Xian Ning ship escorted the troops of the Third Education Division to Yuezhou and also rushed to fight. Until ten o'clock in the night, the enemy could not support it, Changsha was captured, and the remnants of the rebels fled in confusion. Public safety and order were restored successively. In the early morning of the 18th, the Shun Sheng and Cheng Sheng ships went to the ports upstream and downstream of Changsha to search for the fleeing rebels, and pursued and swept Xiangtan. Now that the army's campaign against the rebels in the waterway has come to an end, I should report the entire process of the Hunan support fleet's campaign against the Zhang Gui rebels.</p>

<h3 id="e57">The Situation of Both Sides After the End of the War in Fujian <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Commander Lu Still Plans a Counterattack from the West Route</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since Commander Liu He-ding completely defeated Commander Lu Xing-bang's troops in the northwestern suburbs of Fuzhou on the morning of the 13th, there are no enemy traces on the northern route. Commander Lu's troops on the western route have retreated to Baisha, eighty li from the provincial capital, but it is still reported that two regiments will be transferred from Yanping Shuikou to Commander Lu's troops, preparing for a counterattack. Commander Liu's troops have only advanced to Tongkou, thirty li from the provincial capital. However, the key passes of Ma'anshan Dafuling on the northern route and Baishalun Wanshoushan on the western route are still guarded by about two regiments of troops, and the defenses are very strict. In the Nangang area, after Commander Lu's troops retreated into Yongtai County, they contacted local bandits Wu Da-ang and Huang Qi-lan, and fought fiercely with the two units of the provincial police team, Liang Ji-chuan and Huang Bing-wu. The fighting has not stopped for three days. Liang and Huang telegraphed the province the day before yesterday to request that troops be sent to assist them. In addition, Liu He-ding hosted a banquet at Hanyuan outside the Shuibu Gate a few days ago, inviting members of the Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Government, the General Chamber of Commerce, and the General Federation of Trade Unions to express his gratitude for their support this time. Yesterday, he hosted a banquet at the division headquarters to entertain the regimental, battalion, and company commanders who participated in the battle, to reward their achievements. At the same time, the Special Party Department printed various leaflets advising Commander Lu's troops and handed them to the naval seaplane Haiyan to distribute them to Baisha Shuikou, urging them to become enlightened. According to a conversation with a military officer of Commander Liu's troops, based on the experience of this battle, although Commander Lu's troops have many soldiers, they lack training; although they have enough weapons, they are not sophisticated. Therefore, there is not much concern about the counterattack, and so on.</p>
<p>Regarding news about Commander Lu's troops, it is rumored that this battle was entirely presided over by Lu Xing-rong, the commander of the Fifth Brigade, and Yang Yu-gu, the chief staff officer of the division headquarters. Lu Xing-bang himself and Lu Xing-ming, the commander of the Fourth Brigade, did not have any preconceived ideas. Therefore, the soldiers fighting were all troops under the jurisdiction of Lu Xing-rong. After this defeat, internal opinions were quite inconsistent. The Minqing faction (Commander Lu's troops are divided into three factions internally, with most of the strategists being from the Fuzhou faction, and the strongmen being divided into the Minqing and Youxi factions) is quite close to southern Fujian due to their hometown relationship with Xu Xian-shi (i.e., the arrested provincial committee member) and Huang Bing-wu, and mostly advocate peace talks. The Fuzhou faction mostly advocates fighting again in order to enter the provincial capital. The Youxi faction advocates shortening the defense line and retreating to Shuikou, temporarily severing relations with the province to wait and see what happens. Observing the trends in Commander Lu's actions in recent days, it is possible that they will follow the Youxi faction's proposal. However, since the outbreak of the war, the province's financial resources have gradually become strained because Commander Lu's troops have intercepted taxes from more than 20 counties in northern Fujian. In terms of commerce, the export of large quantities of paper, wood, bamboo, tea, bamboo shoots, and charcoal, all of which come from upstream, has been cut off, and it has also been suspended. Therefore, the scourge of war has had a particularly significant impact on commerce. (June 19)</p>

<h3 id="e58">Trouble at the Minghua Bank <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Caused by Rumors Spread by the Japanese</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Minghua Savings Bank on Zhongshan Road in this city has a solid foundation and its business is divided into three departments: commercial, savings, and trust. The bank has about 3,000 depositors and deposits of about 2 million yuan. It has always had a good reputation and annual profits. This time, due to rumors spread by the Japanese, a run on the bank occurred yesterday (the 18th). Today, many depositors are still crowding to withdraw their deposits. The Public Security Bureau, fearing disturbances, has dispatched dozens of police officers to maintain order at the front and back doors of the bank. Anyone who withdraws money must first obtain a number from the nearby police station and enter to withdraw money according to the number. Therefore, the order is still not chaotic. The banking community and the General Chamber of Commerce of this city held an emergency meeting last night to maintain the market and discuss maintenance measures, and selected personnel to go to the bank to check the accounts. The results of the investigation showed that there were no deficits and tens of thousands of yuan in surplus. However, because the bank has handled trusts and has dozens of real estate properties, the existing cash is not enough to cope with the situation. The banks decided that from the 19th, they would provide 200,000 yuan per day, including 60,000 yuan from the Bank of China, 60,000 yuan from the Bank of Communications, 40,000 yuan from the Shanzuo Bank, and 20,000 yuan each from the Dalu Bank and the Zhonglu Bank. In addition to the above funds, the bank also remitted a large amount of cash from Shanghai to provide assistance. It is estimated that about 200,000 yuan was withdrawn on the 18th and more than 600,000 yuan was withdrawn today (the 19th). The bank still has a lot of deposits and can cope with the situation without being affected. The municipal government also issued a notice today to refute the rumors for the bank. The notice is as follows: "According to reports, on the 18th of this month, depositors of the Minghua Bank in this city have been withdrawing their deposits one after another, and there have been some disturbances. The reason for the investigation is that there are rumors that the Shanghai head office has gone bankrupt, causing panic. The bank has been established in this city for a long time and has a good reputation. Its Shanghai head office has no unstable news. Depositors can fully trust the bank and not believe rumors, so as not to cause disturbances." (June 19)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Liaoning Destroys Heroin for the Second Time by Burning <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: A large batch of heroin, totaling 239 packages, was seized by the postal bureau from Germany via Siberia to a Japanese person in Changchun. Together with a package of heroin seized earlier from Switzerland, it was publicly destroyed by the provincial government in Xiaohaiyan Public Stadium on the 16th in accordance with the scheduled method. The heroin sent from Germany this time is worth about one million yuan in total. In order to deceive people, the traffickers dyed it in various colors such as red, blue, pink, brown, and yellow to pretend to be dyes. Each box weighs about twenty taels, and is packed in a tin box of about three inches square with a round lid. On the lid is a white round piece of paper with different words. The outer packaging is a yellow paper box, and the cover is thick yellow paper with a square of white paper pasted on it, printed with the address of the package, etc. In addition, there is a package of heroin (white) previously sent from Switzerland, which is contained in a flat and long iron box, weighing about two pounds. It was previously sent to Yingkou for chemical inspection and was destroyed together this time. On that day, two mat sheds were set up in the stadium, and pictures, slogans, charts, etc. of the Anti-Drug Association were pasted inside and outside. The central one was used for inspection and unpacking, and the north one was used for entertaining guests. Before 11:00 a.m., representatives of various agencies arrived one after another. Foreigners included consuls from Britain, France, Germany, Austria, and the Soviet Union, as well as Baltic, the Liaoning Postmaster, Xiao, the Customs Commissioner, and others. At about 11:20 a.m., all the heroin was transported by car and immediately followed the previous procedure, first inspecting the cover, then opening the package and retaining samples (half a spoonful was taken from each box and placed in an envelope, and each envelope was sealed with sealing wax and signed by Yan Yu-heng for preservation). It was not until about 1:00 p.m. that all 240 packages were opened. Because the square box with a round opening was not easy to empty, it was placed together with the tin box in the prepared four large pots, and kerosene was used to light the firewood up and down. The stove built with bricks was lit, and black waves rose up. All the visitors left their seats and hurriedly avoided the wind to avoid poisoning. The photography and filming activities of the Cultural Society and the Guangming Photography Studio were very busy. After a while, the smoke and fire gradually subsided, and it was gradually burned completely. All the people who came to the stadium then dispersed one after another. (June 16)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Harbin City to Build a Waterworks <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Harbin City Council Ordered to Reorganize</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Harbin City waterworks construction plan has been going on for three years. The authorities, in view of the failure of the Jilin waterworks construction, are extremely cautious in order to avoid wasting huge sums of money and achieving no results. First, a waterworks construction committee was established in the Special City Bureau the year before last, with specialized personnel from the Governor's Office, the Special City Council, the City Bureau, and other agencies responsible for the design. Recently, it was learned that the waterworks in Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, and other ports are all old-style constructions, and there is no need to imitate them. Only the Zhabei waterworks in Shanghai is a new-style construction. Therefore, it was decided to send technicians to inspect it immediately, so as to learn from it. When construction begins in the future, bidding will be invited in batches. Items such as machines and water pipes will be contracted separately to avoid being deceived by intermediaries. Bidding will begin on July 1, and construction is expected to begin in the middle of August. The city is divided into five districts, starting with Daoli, and then extending to Daowai, Majiagou, Xiangfang, and Bazhan. It is expected to be completed in two years. The construction cost is set at 3 million yuan. It has been decided to issue municipal bonds worth 2 million yuan in late July, specifically for this project. As for the city's improvement of sewers, four-fifths have been completed, and it will be completed by the end of next month. While the city's construction is underway, the city council suddenly heard of reorganization. The reason is that the Harbin City Council was established after it was recovered in 1926. The charter was drafted, imitating Pingjin, and incorporating the board of directors situation of the old British and Russian agreements. The Municipal Bureau, the executive agency, has one officially appointed mayor and one assistant officer each. The other assistant officer and two section chiefs are recommended by the citizens and appointed by the government. The opinions of the officially appointed and citizen-recommended parties are often in opposite positions, resulting in occasional disputes. At the same time, the number of city self-government councilors is as high as 40. At each meeting, there are many people and mixed opinions, which often leads to disputes. As a result, the Municipal Bureau, the executive agency, often does not know what to do. In the newly elected third session of city councilors this year, there are some who were illegally elected, resulting in lawsuits in court. The supervisory agency cannot handle it. The current mayor, He Yu-fang, specially reported it to the Northeast Road Committee, which ordered the Administrative Governor's Office to reorganize the city council, abolish the third session of councilors, and conduct elections. The city's organizational charter and the systems of assistant officers and councilors will be revised. The election will be held around next month, and the new council will be convened around September. Before the new council is convened, all construction in the city will be submitted to the Administrative Governor's Office for approval and implementation, and will be sent to the City Council for retroactive approval in the future to comply with the procedures.

<h3 id="e61">The Ministry of Agriculture and Mining's Views on Relief for the Unemployed <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>C. Matters Concerning the Mining Industry</p>
<p>(1) Maintaining Shutdown Coal Mines (Reasons) China's coal industry is roughly divided into foreign-funded and state-owned. In 1928, the output of foreign-funded coal mines was about 13 million tons. Calculated at a coal production rate of 0.450 per worker, a total of about 80,000 miners were employed. The output of state-owned coal mines was about 12 million tons. Calculated at a coal production rate of 0.210 per worker, a total of 157,000 miners were needed. This means that the output of state-owned coal mines is less than half that of foreign-funded coal mines, while the number of workers is twice as high. This is because there are fewer machine plants and more native kilns. In addition, the main foreign-funded mines, such as the Fushun and Kailuan mines, are all located in the northeastern provinces, where the area is relatively peaceful and there is foreign protection, so they can develop in an orderly manner. State-owned mines are mostly located in the interior of China and are subject to military, bandit, communist, and transportation influences, which have led to the decline of the mining industry. In the past one or two years, coal mines near the Pinghan, Jinpu, and Jiaoji railways have been shut down one after another due to inconvenient transportation or disturbances by soldiers and bandits. Coal mines in Jiangxi and Hunan have also ceased operations. If the number of workers in state-owned coal mines in 1928 is calculated with 70% unemployed, it has reached 110,000 people. If we want to relieve these unemployed workers, maintaining state-owned coal mines is the first priority. (Measures) 1. The government should prepare 3 million yuan to subsidize or lend to various coal mining companies to supervise and order them to start work as soon as possible. 2. A special allocation of 800,000 yuan should be made to the Pingxiang Coal Mine, which will be temporarily maintained by the government. 3. The Ministry of Railways should be ordered to increase the number of vehicles on each route as soon as possible, reduce freight rates, and eliminate loopholes to facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>(2) Reorganizing Gold Mines in the Eastern Provinces (Reasons) Most of China's gold production comes from placer gold mines, and the most prosperous placer gold mines are in the northeast, with Heilongjiang being the first and Jilin being the second. For example, in Duoku, Mohe, Qiqian River, Yuqinggou, and Yilan Huachuan, the government used to set up bureaus to mine gold, and the output was very high. After 1916, due to the impact of the European War, silver rose and gold fell, and mining could not make a profit, so the mining industry was suspended, and the number of unemployed reached tens of thousands. Although there are more than 30 gold mining companies that continue to mine, most of them are speculative in nature. The capital is not sufficient, and the technology is not good enough. It is difficult to develop by digging here and there, and the remaining tens of thousands of workers have no hope of resuming their careers. We should find ways to restore the gold mining industry in the area to relieve the unemployed workers. ) (Measures) The government should allocate 1 million yuan to temporarily establish gold mining bureaus in Heihe and Shiwei in Heilongjiang and Yilan in Jilin, recruit workers to select sites for mining, and plan for development. (3) Reorganizing Tungsten Mines in Southern Jiangxi (Reasons) The most abundant tungsten mines in China are in the counties of southern Jiangxi, followed by Hunan and Guangxi. In 1928, the national output of tungsten sand was more than 7,300 tons, worth about 2.5 million yuan, accounting for 60% of the world's output. The output of Jiangxi province alone accounts for 90% of the national output. Therefore, tens of thousands of people in southern Jiangxi rely on mining tungsten sand for a living. In the past, merchants organized companies to contract for collection and sales. Now this company has been expressly ordered to be abolished. The government should run it itself to maintain the livelihood of tens of thousands of unemployed people. (Measures) The central government and the Jiangxi provincial government should jointly raise 1 million yuan to establish a bureau to recruit workers for mining, temporarily using the sand collection method, while purchasing machinery for large-scale equipment.</p>
<p>(4) Restoring Mercury Mines in Guizhou (Reasons) China's mercury ore is mostly produced in Guizhou, such as the counties of Shengxi, Tongren, Bazhai, Zijiang, Xiuwen, Nanlong, and Qianxi. Shengxi and Bazhai are the most famous. Others, such as Fenghuang in Hunan and Youyang in Sichuan, are also known for producing mercury. In the past, the mercury ore production of Guizhou province alone reached 1,000 tons per year. During the European War, in addition to domestic use, the export of mercury reached 200 tons per year. Since then, the local area has been unstable, and mining and transportation have been difficult. The mining industry in various places has therefore declined. A few years ago, there was still a small amount of production, but now it has been completely stopped. As a result, all the raw sand silver used in the country relies on foreign countries, and the annual losses are very large. The unemployed miners in these provinces, about tens of thousands, are very worrying. (Measures) The government should temporarily allocate 200,000 yuan to establish bureaus for mining and transportation in Tongren and Huangping counties in Guizhou to make adjustments and seek development.</p>
<p>The above four measures concerning the mining industry are based on the actual situation and are urgent and feasible. A total of 6 million yuan is needed, and about 300,000 unemployed miners can be relieved. In addition, undeveloped coal and iron mines, copper mines in Yunnan, oil mines in Shaanxi and Gansu, and iron plants in Hanyelongyan are difficult to implement due to inconvenient transportation, high costs, or excessive expenses. They will be planned separately, so they will not be listed. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Wuhu Quick Report <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>All sectors held a meeting at the General Chamber of Commerce this afternoon. Because the foreign rice purchased by the low-priced rice sales office has been sold out, it was decided that the General Chamber of Commerce would borrow 30,000 yuan from the banking community and various money shops to continue purchasing foreign rice from Shanghai to provide assistance. The Municipal Administration Office is also requested to collect additional donations for the transportation of rice by wheelbarrow and sailing boats, one cent for each purchase and sale, to compensate for the losses of low-priced sales. It was decided that the three rice mills of Hunhouchang, Huangyuankang, etc., which were found to be smuggling and storing rice for export, would be fined 30,000 yuan and used for low-priced sales expenses.</p>
<p>The Capital Garrison Headquarters recently sent an inspector to Wuhu to secretly arrest a wanted criminal surnamed Dong. Dong was captured near the Lefuhui yesterday morning, and three men, one woman, and one child were detained and immediately escorted to Beijing for interrogation.</p>
<p>Sun Sheng-wu, the Director of the Department of Finance, came to Wuhu to raise funds from the banking community, and then went to Beijing on official business. Yesterday, he and Shui Zi, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, passed through Wuhu on the Anfeng ship and returned to the province.</p>
<p>Yuan Shou-jun, the magistrate of Hexian County, was previously dismissed by the provincial government and replaced by Zhang Jing-zhou. The local people from all walks of life in Hexian County organized a "Retain Yuan and Reject Zhang" movement. The provincial government, believing that this move was related to its prestige, specially sent Li Wan-shi from the Department of Civil Affairs to thoroughly investigate. Li and the newly appointed Zhang arrived in Wuhu today and are scheduled to go to He tomorrow. (June 21)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Zhenjiang Quick Report <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Provincial Party Rectification Committee sent Zhang Hong-en as the Party Rectification Committee of Picheng County, Wang Ji as the Party Rectification Committee of Haimen County, Wang En-rong and Huang Ming-xian as the Party Rectification Committee of Yizheng County, and Wu Xiang as the Party Rectification Committee of the Dongtai District directly under it. ▲ The Jiangsu Finance Special Commissioner's Office yesterday appointed Wang Yi-sun, Zhong Nian, and Tong Huai-sheng as members of the silk cocoon tax inspection committee in various districts. In addition, Zong Shou-yu, the director of the Yancheng Tax Office, and Zhu Xu-fu, the deputy director, were transferred to the province after their terms expired, and Shen Kui-long and Yao were appointed to replace them. Mo Liang, the director of the Fankong Tax Office, was assigned to another position, and Yuan Qing-xuan was appointed to replace him. Wang Qi-jie, the director of the Suku Micro-Tax Office, was relatively short of funds, and Xu Zhen was appointed to replace him.</p>
<p>The Department of Finance, due to the shortage of provincial treasury funds, urgently needs funds. All pig, fish, rice, and paddy taxes collected by the tax bureaus and offices, as well as the 10% and 20% surcharges, are related to the necessary needs for disbursement. Yesterday, it specially ordered the tax offices and financial bureaus in various counties to clear and remit funds every ten days without delay.</p>
<p>The Qingjiang long-distance passenger ships of various small shipping companies in Zhenjiang used to operate jointly. Only one long-distance passenger ship from upstream and downstream was opened every day, and eight companies, including Shenji, took turns on duty. The ticket revenue earned each day was divided equally among the eight companies, so the boat fare was unusually expensive. Now the eight companies have suddenly changed from joint to separate operation, and each company is opening Qingzhen routes separately, competing with each other, and the ticket price for smoking sheds has been reduced to two corners, passenger cabins to four corners, and cabin rooms to eight corners, which is several times lower than the previous ticket price.</p>

<p>Actively Preparing for the Jiangsu Rehabilitation Center: Lin Biao, the President of the Jiangsu High Court, was previously ordered by the Ministry of Justice and Administration to survey a suitable site and build a rehabilitation center for criminals. After receiving the order, President Lin designated the old silk weaving factory, the original site of the old copper coin bureau, inside Panmen, as a suitable site for building a rehabilitation center or a sub-prison. He sent a letter to the provincial government a few days ago to request an allocation of funds, and the provincial government ordered the Department of Construction to review it. The Construction Bureau of Wuxian County, together with Wei Bang-zhen, the Chief Secretary of the High Court, and Shi Ze-chen, the Chief of the Prison Section, went to inspect and report to the Construction Department, which submitted it to the provincial government for suggestions. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Department also believes that anti-revolutionary cases in various parts of the province have been emerging one after another, and the arrested reactionaries are all tried and handled by the High Court. However, the defendants who have not yet been decided are detained in prisons, and there is inevitably reactionary behavior. If a rehabilitation center is not actively prepared and given appropriate education, it will inevitably affect ignorant criminals. Therefore, it has formulated measures and submitted them to the central government for approval and implementation. The central government sent a letter to the Ministry of Justice and Administration, ordering its subordinate departments to handle it. Now, Ye Xiu-feng, a Standing Committee member of the Provincial Party Department, saw the active progress of the High Court, so he came to Suzhou in person on the 21st to meet President Lin. Wei Bang-zhen, the Chief Secretary, came out to negotiate and discuss the measures, and then left, deciding to return to the province today.</p>

It then submitted a report to the Department of Agriculture and Mining regarding the Huinong and other eight breeding farms, which were found to have substandard breeding practices. The department approved the report and ordered the respective counties to suppress and stop spring breeding at these farms. As the summer silkworm second sleep period is approaching, the office needs to continue dispatching personnel to supervise various districts.

<p>Various Parties Deliberate on Adjusting the Rice Shortage: The price of rice in Wuxi is soaring, and the rice reserves are dwindling daily. Various parties are devising ways to prepare for relief. Tang Weizhi sent a letter to various sectors a few days ago, advocating for the rapid organization of a relief association and hoping that farmers' banks in various places would emulate social methods of purchasing rice and lending it to farmers. However, Gu Shuzhi, the director of the Fourth District Office of the Provincial Farmers' Bank, stated that the Wuxi Farmers' Bank was newly established and is currently actively preparing for agricultural credit lending. However, its funds are limited, making it difficult to purchase rice and lend it to the people. Various districts are currently preparing for price controls and will provide assistance to the best of their ability. The Millstone Industry Association also held an urgent temporary meeting yesterday to vigorously seek ways to adjust the situation. It was decided to send a letter to the Joint Association of Rice Industry Associations of Shanghai, Jiangsu Province, and the Ninghu Municipal and County, informing the rice industry in both the north and south that imported foreign rice should first be circulated in the province's interior to alleviate the people's hardships. At the same time, a request was submitted to the county government to expedite price controls to temporarily maintain the current situation.</p>

They were handed over to the county for interrogation the day before yesterday. Yesterday late at night, County Magistrate Sun Zuji personally conducted the interrogation, prohibiting bystanders from listening, so the details of the testimony are unknown. However, it was heard that the testimonies of Lü and Hang were largely the same as their testimonies at the Public Security Bureau, while Deng was still being evasive. As a result, County Magistrate Sun ordered all of them to be shackled and sent to prison to await further interrogation and judgment.</p>
<p>Yang Zhongtian Sued Again: Yang Zhongtian, from Yangtie Lane, Yangming Township, Wuxi County, was originally a vagrant. Later, he became a silk cocoon broker and now operates the Wanfeng Silk Cocoon Company along the river at the Labor Movement Bridge. In recent years, he has also been heavily involved in the silkworm egg trade, making substantial profits. As a result, Yang is in a very wealthy situation and spends his days gambling and smoking opium. Last year, he was sued once for selling inferior silkworm eggs. Recently, Yang Zhongtian was accused of attempting to default on more than a thousand yuan in dried cocoon payments. Nineteen cocoon households, including Shao Sisheng, Yu Ruzhou, and Zhang Maoqing, jointly filed a civil lawsuit with the county government to pursue the debt. The day before yesterday, the households took Yang into custody and collectively interrogated him. Zhou, the trial officer, opened a court to conduct the trial. Yang claimed that the debt had already been paid. Zhou asked why, if the debt had been paid, he did not collect and cancel the joint receipt, allowing others to keep it. At this point, Yang had no response. After the interrogation, he was ordered to post bail and await further summons.</p>

A departmental order has now been received, provisionally allowing this handling fee to be stopped after the current 2 million yuan loan is repaid. Regardless of whether there is a loan in the future, this cannot be used as an example again. The merchants will now provide a detailed list of the number of tickets paid, as well as the date of exchange, and submit it to the audit branch for verification and clarification to receive a refund.</p>

<p>Operational Expenses Should Account for Thirty Percent</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, in order to review and distribute the key points for social education facilities in various counties for the 19th year, orders the Education Bureaus of various counties to comply and implement them. The order states that, although efforts have been made to promote social education in various counties over the past three years, and a considerable foundation has been established, due to the fact that all facilities are mostly of a pioneering and experimental nature, they have not yet been fully perfected in practice. Now that the 19th year is about to begin, it is necessary to show the target and clearly indicate the path, so that the counties know where to turn for social education facilities, which is not enough to provide a model and facilitate promotion. The department, in view of this, has specially formulated twenty-two key points for social education facilities in various counties for the 19th year. In addition to distribution, a copy will be sent to the Bureau Directors, who are ordered to immediately comply and implement them. This is of utmost importance. This order.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Key Points for Attention Regarding Social Education Facilities <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>(1) The most important principle for social education facilities this year is to improve the lives of the people, promote local autonomy, and advance the work of political tutelage. (2) All facilities should focus on the widespread promotion of rural areas, and concentrate the majority of material and spiritual resources on adult literacy education. (3) All facilities should develop comprehensive plans for the entire county, create specific programs, and individual implementation procedures, and submit them to the Department of Education for approval before implementing them earnestly.</p>
<p>(4) Based on appropriate objective standards, divide the entire county into several public education districts, and designate public education centers or farmers' education centers as the central institutions for implementing urban and rural public education within the district. The aforementioned central institutions for implementing public education should coordinate with other administrative and educational institutions.</p>
<p>(5) The establishment of central institutions for implementing public education should be phased in, but within this year, at least two to four institutions should be established in the most needed areas, based on economic capacity and the number of districts. The organization should be as simple as possible, aiming to use fewer personnel and accomplish more. (6) To implement adult literacy education, the following committees should be organized, first following the provincial methods: (1) Literacy Movement Committee, (2) Phonetic Symbols Promotion Committee, (3) Public School Promotion Committee. When necessary, items (2) and (3) may be combined into item (1) for handling.</p>
<p>(7) Public schools, in addition to establishing specialized schools as much as possible, all agencies and schools should uniformly establish them as annexes. Detailed regulations for the annexes will be issued separately.</p>
<p>(8) Public schools should hold two terms each year, and complete graduation within the prescribed time limit for each term. Teaching hours do not necessarily have to be at night, and should be based on the convenience of the learners.</p>
<p>(9) In places where public schools cannot be established, or where class-based teaching is not applicable, literacy centers and inquiry centers should be widely established, and mobile teaching methods should be adopted as a substitute.</p>
<p>(10) In places where literacy education is developed, or where there is group living, higher-level public schools and vocational supplementary schools for farmers, workers, and businesses should be piloted. Their organizational structure should be flexible, and they should all equally emphasize civic training. (11) Libraries and gymnasiums should be established uniformly in counties where they have not yet been established. In counties where they have already been established, they should be promoted appropriately, with the goal of balanced development with the central institutions implementing public education.</p>
<p>(12) Various social education institutions other than libraries and gymnasiums should be promoted appropriately according to the actual needs and economic conditions of each county.</p>
<p>(13) All existing social education institutions should uniformly streamline their organizations, and find ways to enrich their content and increase efficiency. Their industrial expenditures should account for at least 30% of the total funding of the institution.</p>
<p>(14) Regarding the improvement of customs and the promotion of public entertainment, appropriate methods should be carefully formulated based on local conditions and actively implemented.</p>
<p>(16) Various public education movements, such as the literacy movement and the hygiene movement, should be earnestly held.</p>
<p>(17) The responsible personnel of all agencies and enterprises should give priority to hiring personnel who have received specialized training in social education.</p>
<p>(18) The performance of all agencies should be strictly evaluated, and the bureau should establish social education supervisors to supervise and urge.</p>
<p>(19) The original and newly added social education funds should be absolutely guaranteed to be independent and should not be diverted to other undertakings outside of social education. If this provision is violated, the funds diverted should be compensated by the director of the bureau privately, and the department will give appropriate administrative sanctions.</p>
<p>(20) Social education funds that have been approved in the budget, and the funds that social education should receive from the reserve funds, may be approved for use due to the definite needs of social education undertakings.</p>
<p>(21) If a farmers' education center has indeed achieved considerable success in expanding its operations, it may be approved to use civil affairs and educational funds specifically designated for this purpose, in addition to the tax on paper.</p>
<p>(22) Accumulated social education funds from before the 18th year, and various social education expenditures for the 19th year, shall not be used without approval. In addition, social education funds that were diverted before the 18th year, after being investigated and recovered, should be used exclusively to compensate for the accumulated deficits in social education funds. If there is a surplus, it should be stored as a social education accumulation fund, and all should be submitted for approval before being disbursed and stored separately.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Summer School Credit Not Counted <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education instructs the Departments of Education of all provinces and municipalities to avoid instructing all schools above the secondary level to run summer schools, originally for the purpose of supplementary studies and advanced study for faculty and staff, and not to immediately calculate summer school grades as credits.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Ministry Order: Yanjing University to Abolish Religious Department <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education believes that the advertisement for new students at Peking Yanjing University includes a specialized department for religious undertakings and social service, which clearly has a propaganda role for religion. It will immediately instruct the Peking Municipal Bureau of Education to order the school to abolish the subject immediately, and the Bureau will check from time to time whether the subject has stopped proceeding.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Xiamen Jimei School Aiding Ye's Trend <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Principal and Director Resign</p>
<p>Students Strike and Petition</p>
<p>Jimei School Because the summer vacation has arrived, and School Director Ye Cai Zhen was detained by the Siming District Court in the Xu case, and has repeatedly requested bail, but has not achieved the purpose, faculty, staff and students are very accustomed and excited. One is that the budget meeting has not been held, and the progress plan for the next semester has not been approved. In fact, there is a trend that it cannot start school. The other is that the central government is headless, and there is an uneasy phenomenon in the school. Teachers have no intention, and scholars are boring. Therefore, the overall resignation and strike occurred. The following is an excerpt from the general resignation telegram of the principals and directors: Singapore Chen Jiageng, the principal of the school, Ye School Director has no evidence to constitute suspicion. The court does not allow bail and does not quickly investigate and pronounce judgment. Human rights are obstructed. What is the benefit of running a school? Please allow me to resign. Jimei Middle School, Fisheries and Commerce, Agriculture and Forestry, Girls' Middle School, Kindergarten Teacher, Male and Female Elementary School Principals, Secretariat General Affairs Office, Accounting Office, Science Museum, Library, Hospital, and Education Promotion Department. Yuan, I heard that after this telegram was sent, the situation was also notified to the overseas Chinese in various ports of Nanyang and newspapers and communities across the country. If the school stops running, the responsibility for the loss of more than 2,000 students in the middle of the road is very important, and southern Fujian education will also go bankrupt from now on.</p>
<p>On the student side, due to their own interests, they convened a general meeting on May 12 and proposed to organize a human rights protection association. Some said that the name of this association was inappropriate and had been banned in various places and could not be used. Others proposed to organize a freedom liberation association, but because the scope was too broad, it was not passed. Later, it was decided to organize a joint federation of student self-government associations of various schools. The representative of fisheries wanted to add the words "temporary", while the representative of the middle school wanted to set it as a permanent organization. There was a lot of discussion and each insisted on his own opinion. Fearing that it would delay the opportunity, the middle school continued to meet separately on the 13th and resolved to strike. At dawn on the 14th, each group elected five representatives to take a motorboat to Xiamen to petition. A total of 65 representatives, led by the sports director Zhuang, arrived at the Siming Court, with tight security, as if facing a formidable enemy. The representatives went straight up to the small building without any joy, and were personally received by the president Deng Ji'an. After talking for a long time, President Deng said that the case was handled by prosecutor Ouyang Han. Ouyang Han was away on official business and would convey the feelings to the representatives when he returned. The representatives strongly requested the release of School Director Ye on bail. President Deng said that according to legal procedures, the prosecutor should make the final decision. The final appointment was made for further discussion, and dispersed." The representatives returned to the school, and the results were incomplete. The methods of dredging are other schools. Seeing the enthusiasm of the middle school, they are also eager to try the kindergarten normal school students with only a hundred people. They will continue to petition on the day of their return. It is said that the school is designing a large-scale petition, knowing that it is difficult for all 2,000 people to go to Xiamen at the same time, they will go by boat and car in stages in advance. After all of them arrive, they will gather in Gulangyu, Xiamen to march and petition until they achieve their goal.</p>
<p>The students of the school have been busy traveling back and forth for several days, and the cost of boats and cars is considerable. The method of raising money is also very new. According to the school's regulations, breakfast is porridge, and lunch and dinner are rice. Since May 13, the student self-government association has announced that all meals will be porridge, and the surplus meal expenses will be used to pay for petition travel expenses.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Request Overseas Party Departments to Encourage Overseas Chinese Schools to Register <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education wrote to the Propaganda Department of the Central Executive Committee, requesting that the overseas general branches and branches be informed separately. When promoting education, the overseas Chinese schools should be registered as soon as possible. A slightly abbreviated publicity letter was attached, stating that the department approved the overseas education promotion publicity outline sent by your department and checked it in the department. The outline is well-prepared. If the overseas general branches and branches can earnestly abide by it, it will be very beneficial to education in China. However, according to the regulations on the registration of overseas Chinese schools, the overseas Chinese schools should follow the amended regulations on the registration of overseas Chinese schools and submit them for registration. The ministry has previously ordered consuls stationed abroad to transfer to local overseas Chinese schools, and has repeatedly issued orders urging them to handle the matter. However, for several months, only a few overseas Chinese schools have followed the regulations to register. The overseas Chinese are far away from their motherland, and they may not be able to understand the central government's emphasis on overseas Chinese education. Moreover, places where consulates are not set up are even more indifferent to these regulations, orders, and regulations. To make overseas Chinese understand the importance of registering overseas Chinese schools, it seems that it is necessary to widely publicize them. It is now planned to consult with your department to send separate letters to the overseas general branches and branches. When promoting education, the overseas Chinese schools should be registered as soon as possible. It is attached as publicity, so that overseas Chinese can deeply understand the importance of registering overseas Chinese schools, and can enthusiastically come to the ministry to register, so that they can start to organize and protect them.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Recent News from the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Education Center <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Investigation and Improvement of Wheat Harvest Results</p>
<p>Editing the Overview of the Provincial Agricultural Education Center</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Education Center sold twelve stones, nine dou, seven liters, and five he of improved wheat seeds last year to 69 households, and guided the planting methods by household. Now that the harvest season has arrived, the center has investigated the harvest results and found that the number of acres planted is 259 acres and 5 fen, the total harvest is 196 stones, two dou, nine liters, and nine he, the average yield per acre is seven dou and five liters and six he, the best yield per acre is one stone and three dou, and the minimum yield per acre is six dou. The average harvest per acre is two dou more than the local variety, it is said. The center recently adopted the principle of publishing cooperation and sent a circular to solicit the overview of the agricultural education centers in various counties, and compiled and printed it to promote it. The main points in the circular said that the cost will be shared based on the number of books taken. This method has several advantages: (1) If each center publishes and exchanges them separately, the printing cost will be more expensive due to the small number of copies, and more postage will be used. (2) If they are compiled into one book, the centers in other provinces and counties can send them to various provinces locally, and the provincial centers can send them separately. Each center only needs to order dozens of copies and donate them for reading in the territory. The publicity effect has reached the whole country. (3) Compilation is simpler and more comprehensive than separate publications, and it is easier to attract attention and be valued. (4) The center can compile statistics from the overview of each center and attach them to the book for research, and also plans 14 simple rules, stipulating that the collection period is until June 25, and the book will be published at the end of July. Those who order 25 copies will pay six yuan, those who order 50 copies will pay ten yuan, those who order 75 copies will pay fourteen yuan, and those who order 100 copies will pay eighteen yuan. The provincial agricultural education center and the agricultural education centers in various counties will share the book fees. The surplus will be returned, and the shortage will be supplemented by the provincial agricultural education center. After receiving the circular, the centers responded and submitted manuscripts, which was quite enthusiastic, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Summary of Summer Educational Administration in Guangdong Education Department (1) Yi Lu <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Formulating work plans for junior high school and specialized fields</p>
<p>Submitted to the Ministry of Education for inspection, verification, and record for implementation</p>
<p>The Guangdong Province Summer Junior High School and Educational Administration have been carefully planned by the Department of Education, including elementary education, secondary education, and higher education. According to the situation and the urgency of the matters to be handled, the outline will be implemented. There are nine items in the outline and dozens of detailed items. The implementation period is from April to June. The following is the detailed work plan for the three months: First, (Elementary Education) (A) Preparation for the implementation of compulsory education. Checking and parallel education are recorded in the party program. However, the popularization of education is based on the promotion of compulsory education. During this period of political tutelage, it is even more important to organize it. We have received Instruction No. 529 from the University Council, ordering us to vigorously implement compulsory education, etc. The Guangdong Provincial Compulsory Education Committee has been organized, and the counties and cities have been ordered to follow it. Due to military influence, the Provincial Compulsory Education Committee has not yet been established, and only a few Compulsory Education Committees have been established in the counties and cities. Now that the overall situation is gradually stable, the Provincial Compulsory Education Committee plans to be established soon, and at the same time, it urges the counties and cities to organize soon. During this period, a thorough investigation of school-age children will be conducted, and the counties will be ordered to establish at least one rural normal school in each county before August of the 19th year in order to store teachers and facilitate progress, so that the plan to reduce the number of out-of-school children year by year can be realized. (B) Urge the counties and cities to increase the number of elementary schools in stages to reduce the number of out-of-school children. The plan has been promulgated by the Ministry of Education and has been distributed for compliance. The elementary schools in the counties and cities of the province are not enough to accommodate out-of-school children according to the survey statistics. It is planned to issue another order urging the counties and cities to make a comprehensive plan, raise funds widely, increase the number of elementary schools in districts, and ban private schools, advocate or subsidize private elementary schools, and draw up a complete plan before the beginning of the 19th year and submit it to the department for approval and implementation. (C) Urge private elementary schools to register. The regulations on the registration of private schools have been promulgated for a long time, and the elementary schools in each prefecture must all register anew, and have been followed in accordance with the Ministry's orders. Now, the elementary schools in each county and city have previously applied for registration, but have not reorganized and reported in accordance with the regulations, and have reported to the counties and cities for approval and established them rashly. It is planned to issue an order separately to report and register as soon as possible in order to follow the unified standard and comply with the regulations. (D) Register various normal school graduates. To promote elementary schools, it is necessary to cultivate teachers first. According to the survey, most of the elementary school teachers in each prefecture are not normal school graduates. In the future, the lack of teachers in the newly established elementary schools will be even more serious. The current remedial measures are to first register various normal school graduates and distribute them to the counties and cities as soon as possible for employment. Moreover, after registration and statistics, the number of existing normal school graduates in various places can be known, and there will be a basis for planning the training of teachers in the future. It is planned that the department will formulate measures and issue an order to the counties and cities to extend the registration period. (E) Formulate measures for summer training courses for elementary school teachers in various counties and cities. Educational trends are constantly changing, and teaching methods are constantly improving. Then, the teachers' cultivation is still there. However, most of the elementary school teachers are class teachers, and there is very little time left outside of the homework. It is planned to use the summer vacation to hold meetings and lectures, so that elementary school teachers can cultivate themselves in time and directly improve the teachers' knowledge, that is, indirectly improve the teaching of elementary schools. The detailed measures for the lectures will be formulated by the department and uniformly implemented by the counties and cities before the summer vacation of the 19th year. (F) Formulate measures for summer vacation schools in elementary schools. Summer vacation schools in elementary schools mean that elementary school students still have to go to school for a certain amount of time every day during the summer vacation to make up for their studies, or be guided by faculty and staff to work, or for various games and sports, or for study tours. Some counties and cities have already run this kind of summer vacation school, and there are some achievements. It is planned that the department will formulate measures and uniformly hold them in the counties and cities during the summer vacation of the 19th year, and the implementation will be called for by the department for assessment.</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Call for the Promotion of Overseas Chinese Education Association <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Education Design Committee Will Hold a Plenary Committee</p>
<p>Liu Shimu and Li Denghui Propose the Formulation of Regulations for the Overseas Chinese Education Association. The Ministry of Education, in order to improve and promote Overseas Chinese education, has specially established the Overseas Chinese Education Design Committee, which has already announced its establishment. It is scheduled to hold its second plenary committee meeting in Beijing on June 25th to discuss various important issues. Committee members Liu Shimu and Li Denghui have submitted a proposal to formulate regulations for the Overseas Chinese Education Association. The original text is now transcribed below:</p>
<p>Since the Central Party Headquarters and Jinan University successively convened Overseas Chinese education conferences to resolve various Overseas Chinese education issues, and then the Second National Education Conference also passed a comprehensive plan to improve Overseas Chinese education, the plan for Overseas Chinese affairs can be said to be well-prepared. However, the resolutions are valuable in their implementation, and the method of implementation must be defined by regulations and detailed rules for compliance. This is a necessary procedure in administration. According to the resolutions on Overseas Chinese education at the Second National Education Conference, the most important and detailed measure is to establish the Overseas Chinese Education Association as the first step. This proposal was previously discussed at the Overseas Chinese education conference convened by the Central Training Department and a decision was made to formulate organizational regulations to be promulgated by the Ministry of Education. However, it has not yet been promulgated, and it is not known which agency is drafting these regulations or where they are being reviewed and approved. This committee is responsible for design, and cannot ignore this matter. A draft should first be prepared and submitted to the Central Party Headquarters for review, and then submitted to the Ministry of Education for promulgation. Now, several principles for the regulations of the Overseas Chinese Education Association are proposed, and the election of drafters is requested to be done immediately. Is this appropriate? We await public decision.</p>
<p>Principles for Formulating Regulations for the Overseas Chinese Education Association</p>
<p>1. The purpose of this Association is to research and develop Overseas Chinese education and assist in Overseas Chinese education administration. 2. Members of this Association include all current and former Overseas Chinese school teachers and staff, and those who are enthusiastic about Overseas Chinese affairs and have contributed to Overseas Chinese education. 3. This Association adopts a committee system. The General Association has nine to eleven committee members, with five or three standing members. Overseas branches have five to seven committee members, with three or one standing member. Committee members are elected by the general membership meeting. However, in the initial stage of the establishment of branches, the General Association may send personnel to prepare. 4. The headquarters of the General Association is located in the capital. The location of overseas branches shall be decided by the General Association Committee through overall planning. It is also possible to establish branches in important ports first. 5. Membership fees are two yuan per person per year. Other expenses are covered by the Ministry of Education from the Overseas Chinese education fund. Branches may receive subsidies from the General Association or raise funds locally. 6. After the establishment of this Association, all existing overseas education associations must reorganize into branches. If there are differences in powers and organizations, they must be reviewed and approved by the General Association.</p>

<p>The Patriotic Girls' School on Hainining Road, Tianbaoli, this city, has a long history and enjoys a well-deserved reputation. The recent graduates of the physical education, senior high school liberal arts, and junior high school departments, having completed their examinations, cherish each other and are holding farewell parties for three consecutive days.

<h3 id="e99">The Content of the Wusong Merchant Marine School <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Today, our country's shipping materials are extremely depleted. It is not only the merchant ships that are like this, but also the navy is in short supply, and there is a sigh of difficulty in finding talent. The Wusong Merchant Marine School of the Ministry of Communications, since its restoration last year, is the only place in our country that cultivates shipping materials. Recently, someone went to visit and had a two-hour conversation with the school's executives. I recorded what they said and summarized it into five items: history, doctrine, equipment, grades, and treatment. It is also what those who care about shipping affairs are happy to hear.</p>
<p>History The school was initiated by Zhang Ji, Tang Weizhi, Sheng Xingcun and other gentlemen during the Xuantong period. They requested the Qing court to allocate 60 mu of the military camp site in Paotai Bay, Wusong, to build school buildings, break away from the naval administration department of Nanyang University, and become an independent school directly under the Ministry of Communications in Beijing. General Sa Dingming, a veteran of the navy, was hired as the principal. The comprehensiveness of the equipment and the excellence of the faculty were unparalleled in the school for a time. In the third year of Xuantong, the first enrollment was held at Nanyang University, and more than 3,000 people registered. The selection was meticulous, and they were all cautious and studious. Later, the students served on merchant ships, breaking the foreign monopoly on the shipping profession, and pioneering the Chinese to serve as captains. To this day, most of the Chinese ship captains and those who preside over important positions in the shipping industry are still former students. Unfortunately, it was closed down in the fourth year of the Republic due to some reason. The school buildings were changed by the Navy Department to run a naval officer school, which resulted in no one rising up later, creating the phenomenon that there is an insufficient supply of crew members in the country today. Otherwise, foreign crew members would have disappeared from Chinese ships long ago. How could this have been expected? When the National Government was established, Minister of Communications Wang Boqun, in view of the fact that the shipping industry was a top priority and that the cultivation of shipping materials could not be delayed, resolutely proposed it. After the Central Political Conference approved the re-establishment of the school, it reopened in the autumn of the 18th year. Minister Wang was publicly elected as the principal, and Yang Zhixiong, a former classmate, was appointed as the deputy. Yang Jun made great efforts to prepare for the restoration of the school. During the 14 years of closure, time and circumstances changed and everything was destroyed. All the instruments, books, machines, school equipment, medicines, and all kinds of sundries worth more than 100,000 yuan disappeared. Now, we are trying to restore the old appearance from the ashes of the robbery. Even the slightest of grass and trees has to be done by hand. The management will be the same as planting trees and nurturing people. Those who lightly destroy the world, how can they know the difficulty of construction? It is regrettable.</p>
<p>Doctrine The school's teaching doctrine is not only to enable students to understand the theory in the textbooks, but also to emphasize the familiarity with practical work. Nowadays, those who practice driving often do not understand the outline of the use of sails and the skills of sailors, and those who practice the engine are craftsmen and apprentices. Those who have a little understanding of the principles of machinery management and construction are even rarer. Therefore, to remedy the shortcomings and correct the students' habit of looking down on themselves and disdaining to engage in labor, the usual education, such as factory practice, boat handling, and rope tying, can be painting, scrubbing, and physical exercise, all of which are equally important to the classroom work. Finally, they will take classes for two years in the school's self-built training ship to cultivate all-round talents before graduating.</p>
<p>Equipment The school's past equipment is as described above. Now, let me describe its current equipment. The equipment that has been purchased includes a basic compass, a small boat compass, a bearing mirror, a depth sounder, a meridian instrument, a sextant, a rangefinder, a positioning instrument, a self-counting barometer, a silver barometer, a depth gauge, a steering wheel, a nautical chart, a wireless radio, and a generator key. There are also a rotating compass, a wireless radio positioning instrument, and an echo depth sounder, all of which are installed in the practice board. The library focuses on nautical books, and there are already more than 1,000 books. There are also thousands of books that have been ordered from various countries in the East and West but have not yet arrived. There are two sampans, each of which can accommodate 20 people, and 50 life jackets are provided. Practice rowing in the Wusong River estuary at a specified time. There are two large and small drill grounds with an area of more than 230,000 square feet. Basketball, football, tennis, billiards, table tennis, and running tracks are all complete. There is one indoor and one outdoor swimming pool. The indoor pool uses邦浦打水, and the outdoor pool is 360 feet long and 75 feet wide. The volume is large. It takes time to use邦浦, so a 500-foot iron pipe will be installed in the pool to connect to the river and use the tide to change the water in the pool. However, it is necessary to obtain the consent of the Public Works Bureau and the 濬浦 Bureau after passing through the road outside the school and the land along the shore before the reconstruction can be carried out. It is already in progress. The machine factory will start construction during the summer vacation this year and will be completed in four months. It will be equipped with a 100-horsepower boiler, generator, machine tool, sand turning field, and other mechanical parts. In addition, a school ship will be built for students to practice on from 1931. It is estimated to be 300 feet long, with a speed of 14 knots, a full-load draft of 16 feet 6 inches, a double-bottom steel plate, a load of 3,000 tons, and will sail to the northern and southern ports of China and various places in Japan and Nanyang. The estimated cost is 1 million yuan. As soon as the government approves it, bids will be invited for construction.</p>
<p>Grades The school has three departments: driving, engine, and crew training courses. In 1929, two driving classes were recruited first. In 1930, one driving class and two engine classes were recruited. After that, one driving and one engine class will be recruited every year. By 1933, the first graduates of the driving department will be assigned to various ships to serve as crew members. Step by step, it will not take ten years to clear out foreign crew members and replace them with Chinese.</p>
<p>Treatment The school treats students with the best possible conditions. The crew profession is inherently difficult. If they are not accustomed to hard work and content with simple living, even if they graduate, they will not be able to devote themselves to it. And the sons of wealthy families are usually fond of leisure. How can they be willing to work hard in this noble profession? Those who are happy to do this and come to study must be outstanding, unique, or have aspirations to learn, and are heartbroken that the shipping industry is controlled by others, strive to be strong, and hope to restore it in the future. These are all outstanding people of the time. The school upholds the purpose of cultivating talents, so it treats students well and tries its best to reduce their burden. It only charges 50 yuan for food expenses for the whole year. Uniforms and books are self-provided, and all other expenses are not charged. It is also working hard to plan for their future after graduation. The Ministry will issue crew certificates, and they can be employed as crew members.</p>

<p>All the faculty and staff of Shanghai College of Political Science and Law, because the school has recently been approved and registered by the Ministry of Education, gathered together to celebrate. They held a meal at the Hua'an Building on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday (22nd) at 12 noon, hosting President Zheng Yuxiu, Chief Chen Qun, and Dean Zhu Wenfu of the school. More than 50 people attended. After the rounds of wine, the faculty and staff publicly elected Yang Gongda to deliver a speech on behalf of the faculty and staff, saying that this banquet was held for three reasons: 1. To express the sadness of temporary separation; 2. To publicly congratulate the successful registration of the school; 3. To request improved and better treatment; 4. To wish the school authorities a smooth implementation of their grand plan. President Zheng responded, saying that the school's registration today is due to the professors' daily efforts in teaching, and expressed his deep gratitude. He also reported on the Ministry of Education's registration situation and the major issues of planning the school's future construction, hoping that the professors would provide assistance. Next, Chief Chen responded, reporting on the general affairs that the general affairs office should handle in the future, and especially taking positive measures in the area of books, hoping that the professors will provide guidance at any time in the future. Dean Zhu responded again, saying that the salary issue raised by the professors can be solved adequately. For a while, the toasts were exchanged, and the hosts and guests dispersed happily at 3 o'clock. It was also heard that President Zheng and others invited all the faculty and staff to a banquet at the World College on Fookaisen Road on the 24th.</p>

<p>Municipal No. 1 Wins Qinghua Two to One</p>
<p>Municipal No. 1 and Qinghua are both among the best of the small football teams. Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, they met at the Municipal No. 1 Public Sports Ground. In the hot sun, they charged and broke through, and they were quite heroic. There were no less than 500 or 600 spectators standing to watch. At the beginning, both sides were very calm and responded to the situation, without any disorder. They went on expeditions to the south and north, and there was no gap to take advantage of, only gaining a lot of sweat. Until 20 minutes, Xiao Rangtian, the center forward of Municipal No. 1, received assistance from Jia Jiliang, the left forward, turned around and kicked the ball into the net. The momentum was extremely fierce and rapid, and the Qinghua goalkeeper could not save it. The trend of losing one goal was already divided, and the morale of the soldiers was even stronger. Qinghua tried even harder to retaliate and approached step by step. Finally, within five minutes, they completed one goal. The first half ended in a tie of one to one. In the second half, Jia Jiliang, the left forward of Municipal No. 1, created a goal again with a blitzkrieg tactic and defeated Qinghua with a score of two to one.</p>

<p>Before marriage, women close their eyes to be kissed by men. After marriage, when their men forget to kiss them, they close their eyes.</p>
<p>Life reaches fifty-five, all things are over, and it is an era when one can realize oneself. After the age of fifty-five, if a man wants to win the favor of young women, he can only play the role of Santa Claus, and there is no possibility of being "Tang Rouan" (a beautiful man of ancient times).</p>
<p>Death is a great adventure, but "marriage" is the greatest adventure, because marriage is a path to a new life, a beginning of a new life, a strange thing of living with someone who is completely unknown.</p>
<p>"Success" kills people more fiercely than artillery fire, and love kills people even more than "success."</p>
<p>A person with a clear mind often encounters accidents that are not taken seriously by fools.</p>
<p>When a woman's address is no longer remembered by any men, and her old nickname is often mentioned by them, this woman has no happiness to speak of, and her nickname is as unremarkable as a phone number.</p>
<p>Modern women have a calm attitude and precise plans. How do I know this? Because before marriage, they often return all the engagement rings they have received to their original owners without error.</p>
<p>Love is blind, but "marriage" is a good medicine for curing blindness. Therefore, the best way for men and women to know each other's hearts is to get married.</p>

<p>Rugao is remotely located on the north bank of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu. Since the spring of the 16th year of the Republic of China, Sun Jun relied on the Yangtze River as a trapped beast to fight. The city of Rugao was ravaged by it, but the six districts of Shizhuang, Lugang, Zhuntao, Chema Lake, Motou, and Jiang'an in the southwest along the river suffered even more. After the national army defeated them, many of them wandered to the local area. They were idle and had no way to make a living, so they formed gangs and robbed people on the road. Then, they kidnapped people for ransom, harassing them for three or four years. Although the military police have been suppressing and arresting them, they have not been able to eliminate them. Those who used to rely on farming for a living did not dare to cultivate, industry and commerce were suspended, the market was depressed, and the food supply was almost cut off. As a result, the slightly wealthy fled to the city walls and other ports. The violent people took risks and joined the bandits. Among these six districts, Shizhuang Town is the most important (commonly known as Shizhuang Lane). It is about 2 miles away from the river bank. The Tongyang wheel sails back and forth, and docks on the bank to load and unload goods. Since the rampant of bandits, the town has increased the number of military police to protect merchants and residents, and also goes to the suburbs to arrest bandits from time to time. Those who are serious offenders are immediately beheaded and displayed to the public. Those who are minor offenders are released on bail. The military police in the town went to a certain place a few days ago and arrested four bandits. Two of them were indeed wanted criminals. They were immediately beheaded and hung on the stone bridge. The other two were detained in prison for interrogation. The bandits heard the news and gathered more than a thousand people at about 4 pm on the 11th to attack from the northwest. There were six military police stationed at the north end of the town. They could not defend themselves and were rushed into the streets. They set fire to the houses. The town's security corps, the Public Security Bureau, and the 3rd squadron of the county police stationed there heard the news and immediately went to resist. Gunshots rang out, one after another. After holding on for a long time, the military police were about to run out of ammunition. Some advocated retreating. Captain Tang (Che Ru) of the garrison unit told the soldiers, "The units stationed in the east and west ports heard the news</p>
<h3 id="e106">Mould Season Musings · Soup · Brush Flower <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>It's the season of mould. The weather is erratic. We must know a thing or two about common sense regarding the mould season. Here, I will gather what I have seen and set it down as follows.</p>
<p>The mould season is the time when all things are damp and steaming. The human body is no exception. Therefore, one must bathe once every day so that the sweat pores are open and unobstructed, and excretion is easy. Avoid eating various pickled foods, such as mouldy fermented bean curd, soy paste, pickled cucumbers, and stinky dried tofu.</p>
<p>Clothes must be changed frequently, quilts and blankets must be aired frequently, windows must be opened frequently, and floors must be washed frequently.</p>
<p>Pour plenty of disinfectant water into the ditches to avoid foul odours. Regularly burn incense coils indoors to add fragrance. It is especially good to plant flowering plants in the courtyard.</p>
<p>Do not fold clothes that have been soaked by continuous rain. They must be hung in a ventilated place.</p>
<p>Alcohol can aggravate dampness, especially during the mould season. You must abstain from drinking it.</p>
<p>If you can follow the above methods, you can avoid illness and maintain good health.</p>
<p>Must come to the rescue. We defend but do not attack. Bullets must not be fired wildly. (Dongxin Rising Port is two li west, Zhang Huang Port is eight li away, the Third Detachment is stationed at these two ports.) Otherwise, all the houses in the town will be reduced to scorched earth. Before long, the detachments from both ports came to assist. Captain Tang then commanded the military police to attack fiercely. After five hours, the bandits could not hold out and retreated. It was already late at night. The next day at dawn, six more bandits sneaked into the central market of the town, setting fires with straw. They were discovered by the military police. One was shot and killed, and the rest escaped. Many large and small households were looted in this battle, making it impossible to investigate. More than one hundred houses were destroyed. Captain Tang of the Central Detachment was wounded in the arm, and four police officers suffered minor injuries. Xu Wan Cheng, the owner of the Xu Fu Sheng Sugar Shop, was wounded in both his arm and legs. The dead were Liu Huan, the captain of the Seventh Detachment, and police officer Huang Ke Wen. About ten other residents were killed by stray bullets. Also, a certain family was preparing for a funeral after someone had died of illness not long before, but the body was also burned to charcoal in the arson. It was truly tragic. It is now said that the local authorities in Ru Yi are planning to organize a disaster relief committee for the six southwestern districts. However, the bandits have not been cleared, agriculture is abandoned in the fields, and industry and commerce have ceased. Even if relief grain is distributed, it will be a drop in the bucket. What good will it do? (Qu Que)</p>
<h3 id="e107">Travel Miscellany - Oh, the Habit <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>A Trip to Chuzhou. Chuzhou is one of the major stations on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway. The distance from Pukou to here is 105 li. The total length of the Jinpu Line is 1,900 li. From Pukou to Xuzhou is the southern section, from Xuzhou to Jinan is the central section, and from Jinan to Tianjin is the northern section, each being six or seven hundred li long. In the past, it only took 21 hours to complete the entire line. Now, each section takes 21 hours. The fare is also almost doubled. This is because, in addition to a price increase of about 30%, there is also a "repair fee" that passengers must bear. However, the deterioration of road administration, the dilapidation of vehicles, and the discomfort of passengers are in direct opposition to the continuous increase in fares. Currently, during the military period, seven or eight out of ten passengers ride without tickets. Railway workers can only shake their heads and sigh.</p>
<p>Chuzhou is famous for Ouyang Xiu's "Record of the Pavilion of the Old Drunkard." Almost all scholars know the phrase "Mountains surround Chuzhou." And "The Old Drunkard's intention is not in the wine" is an even more common allusion. However, an examination of the actual situation reveals that this is not the case. The Chuzhou area is not surrounded by many mountains. There are only small hills in the south of the city, and the north is mostly plains. Small hills, under Ouyang Xiu's pen, become large mountain peaks that encircle and overlap. The difference in perspective is like this.</p>
<p>The Pavilion of the Old Drunkard has long been dilapidated. The rebuilt version is located ten li from the station at the foot of Mount Langya. It has some scenery. Below is the Langya Stream, also known as Brewing Spring. The geography of ancient and modern times has not changed much. To the west of Chuzhou is Qingliu Pass, where Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty defeated Li Jing's army of 100,000 soldiers and captured his generals Yao Feng and Huangfu Hui. In addition, there are scenic spots such as Fengle Pavilion and Tea Immortal Pavilion. Their names are certainly beautiful and elegant, but once you get there, you only see weeds, desolate smoke, dilapidated walls, and broken wells. Famous scenic spots are mostly like this.</p>
<p>Chuzhou relies on old-fashioned iron-wheeled rickshaws for transportation. These are all things that have been eliminated in the cities and have survived in the countryside. The wheels are made of wood instead of iron. Coupled with the dilapidated condition of the car body and the accumulation of roads</p>

<p>30th. Today I printed a name card. It cost one and a half yuan. It would cost no more than forty cents at home. One and a half yuan, when exchanged for national currency, is worth two and a half yuan. You can know the difference in living expenses here from home from this one aspect. Small workers earn one or two yuan a day. A rickshaw ride costs eight or nine cents an hour. Only haircuts are very cheap. It used to cost forty cents, but now it has been reduced to twenty cents. Small shops charge a dime and a half. Only the people here are more mature than those at home. There are fewer incidents of rampant bandits. The government provides good protection, and you can live and work in peace. The gates of the large mansions of the capitalists are still open, and they are not very worried about thieves. It is not like Shanghai, where people knock on doors and rob in broad daylight. This is not something you see here.</p>
<p>The Communist Party problem also exists occasionally. Slogans are occasionally found on the streets. But I heard that the method of prevention here is also different from that of our country. I heard that the Dutch method of prevention is the best. There is no pain at all. If someone is found to be advocating communism, they are not punished. They are only asked to realize their ideology in a certain place. This place is a desolate island in the middle of the sea. There are no ships coming and going. It is a place for exiled communists. There is land to cultivate. They are ordered to operate there forever. I heard that there are also women, but probably very few. This method is better than killing in our country. It seems that it is okay to imitate it.</p>
<p>The tram rules here are still good. Most of the drivers are Malays, and there are also Chinese. People are generally well-behaved. Their hospitality seems to be like the Japanese style. The trams in Beijing and Tianjin are also good. Only Shanghai is the worst, even below the Malays. Alas.</p>
<p>On the 31st, I visited an Indian church. It is roughly Brahmin. Various flowers are placed in the middle. I respectfully took off my shoes and entered. From the hall, I looked at the god they worshiped. In the pitch-black lamp, its face was black. It was suspicious and frightening, almost like the City God. India is a nation of polytheistic fantasies. There are many Indian-style Buddha statues and famous ones here. All show their fantasies. Most are like the Thousand-Handed Guanyin. They mostly regard the elephant as king. I know in Annam that they regard the tiger as king. They worship the tiger everywhere. India worships the elephant. Watching Indian paintings can cause people to hallucinate. It is also a way to unleash thoughts. I bought the most famous Indian painting to take home for my children to play with. The Buddha statues painted in various places in Japan are all like Japanese people. Northern paintings are like northern people. Western paintings are like western people. Indian paintings of Buddha statues are like Indian people. The Indian style of Buddha statues is the true Buddha statue. The Malays in the Nanyang region, although they worship Islam, are dominated by Indianization. Many monks here travel to India. I heard that it only costs one hundred yuan to go back and forth. Why don't the Buddhists in our country travel to India? Japanese people travel to India one after another. The local Indians, however, engage in petty trading. Those from Ji Ling sell. There are few big merchants. Recently, the Indian leader Gandhi was arrested. The Indians are gradually becoming more assertive. I heard that Tagore is not in India but in the UK. Tagore is a peaceful person, unlike Gandhi, who is a resistance faction.</p>
<p>In short, the trend in various parts of Nanyang is that the Philippines is independent, Siam is strong, and Burma and Annam are all starting revolutions. India is also the same. The future trend will inevitably lead to the establishment of a Nanyang federation. It is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>The dirt matched. I heard that in previous years, during bountiful harvests, the market was quite lively. Now, however, years of drought have made farmers appear emaciated. The market has greatly declined. This is no doubt related to the military situation.</p>
<p>Chuzhou has the Ninth Normal School of Anhui Province. The school is located in the west of the city. It has a lot of scenery. The campus is full of lush trees and shallow grass. It is a pity that the sounds of reading have stopped for a long time, and the students are scattered. Now, only a few fragments of Western-style buildings remain.</p>
<p>I once visited a small primary school in Chuzhou City. I only saw that the students were all handsome and lovely. Unfortunately, it has now been converted into a hospital for wounded soldiers. Alas.</p>

<p>French Autumn Salon 丨 1929 SalondAutomne1929</p>
<p>(2) A brief history of the Autumn Salon</p>
<p>Only a few years later, the Autumn Salon had already swept through most of the Europeans of the time. There were even many people who regarded the producers of the Autumn Salon as idols. Being able to produce the Autumn Salon was a great honour. This was the pure aspiration of European artists. Especially many of the big shots opened up public roads for new trends from different aspects. Without narrowly or superficially establishing factions to limit production. As long as you have good things and fresh creations, you can be included in the list. It is not based on paintings by Bonnard or Matisse as the standard. Nor is it dominated by Van Dangen or Marguai. Nor does it mean that Trang Derain Guerlain or anyone else is considered a follower. It is a simultaneous combination of all writers who are incompatible but have new life to oppose that dead, boring, and decadent art, that is, to rebel against the traditional art of the government.</p>
<p>From this point of view, it is a transformation in art. Looking at the whole thing, it is a transformation in thought. Modern people's lives are always moving towards the "dynamic" and "active" aspects. Although we don't understand it ourselves, we are always moving towards new aspects. This is indeed the case. We are living. We are always moving towards the fresh hope of the future. We hope for a glorious era in the future. So we desperately want to move towards the "living" side. Those who silently abide by tradition, are content with a static, dead life, and believe in maintaining the status quo are already lagging behind the times. They are merely possessing a body without a spirit. They are equivalent to the already dead. Therefore, modern, true, and profound art must move towards the "dynamic" and "active." It establishes a kind of life from the creative aspect. However, in China, where art knowledge is extremely naive, a generation of vulgar people, how can they understand the beauty of colour, the beauty of form, the internal life and profound rhythm of art? They take drawing the head and painting the corners as beautiful. They consider painting history, legends, or patriotic paintings to be noble subjects. They only know the superficial outer form. They do not understand the true meaning of art at all. Even ordinary people who claim to be painters are full of such vulgar views. They regard describing the dead outer form and worshiping the end skills of the official school as something to be proud of. These people can paint a few portraits for the rich and earn some money, but they cannot really talk about modern valuable art, because he is already a dead person with only a body and no soul. This situation is also unavoidable in France. There are also many vulgar artisans like this. But they have already been abandoned to the lower classes and excluded from the modern art scene.</p>
<p>I have already digressed slightly from the topic. Now let's get back to the point. The Autumn Salon has already become the general organization of the modern art scene. But there are still those vulgar people who hold opposing attitudes.</p>
<p>The reason why the Autumn Salon can have such authority is thanks to a dictator. He used the strict organization of the French Republic to organize the sacred Autumn Salon. This dictator is the madman Frantz Jourdain</p>
<p>The strangest thing is that the two most prominent and authoritative salons are both under the rule of a dictator. No one in Europe doesn't know that Shardan combined the spirit of Lenin and Mussolini into one to engage in the artistic revolution movement and be the protector of new art. Shardan is the chairman of the Autumn Salon, just like Paul Signae is the chairman of the Independent Exhibition SsocietedeArtistesIndependato. Although their personalities are different, sometimes even extremely opposite. But each one tries his best to protect the authority of a salon is equally great.</p>
<p>The history of the Autumn Salon can be said to be intertwined with the history of its dictator. The Autumn Salon's current and future development is mostly due to his capacity.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Gold Market Soars Last Week <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Large Amounts of Remittances Frequently Shrink…Gold Price Reaches the Summit</p>
<p>Short Sellers Heavily Hit…Future Prospects Still Fear Further Rise</p>
<p>The Peak Reaches 615 Taels. The gold market was extremely rampant last week, with the peak rising daily. The degree of ascent was unusually rapid, almost reaching the summit. However, the daily changes were very severe, with fluctuations of more than ten taels. The market atmosphere was chaotic, and the momentum was unstoppable. The storm was turbulent, and people were extremely panicked. Since the beginning of the week (the 16th), it coincided with the rollover period. The bulls posted two or three taels. Because of the abundance of spot goods, the market price in August was higher. On this day, it suddenly broke through the 600-tael mark. Afterwards, it hovered around 600 taels. As for the British and American silver markets, the latent low trend and the exchange rate tightened first and then挫, and finally turned to a firm trend. Chinese speculators occasionally made intake and outflow of hedges, and it seemed to be approaching. However, the gold market was incomparably excited at the weekend and suddenly burst out more than 610 taels, repeatedly breaking new records and even discovering the unprecedented peak of 615 taels. The future prospects still fear further rise. However, although the buying and selling in the market are lively every day, there is no request for a large amount of supply. The real reason is that the market price changes are uncertain. The exchange has already limited the amount of closing positions. The general short sellers are dumbfounded and heavily hit. Compared with the previous weekend, the August issue is about 34 or 5 taels higher than the July issue (excluding the rollover of two or three taels). As for the price quoted by the gold traders, it was initially suppressed by 90 taels, but later only 50 taels. Now, the general situation in the past six days will be described in detail below.</p>
<p>In the middle of the week, it rose 37 taels. Since Monday coincided with the rollover period, the buyers initially posted two or three taels, then more than four taels. The lowest dropped to a few cents, and finally about three taels. The opening price in August was 592 taels and a half. It then returned to 89 taels and a half. Afterwards, it stepped onto the clouds and exceeded the 600-tael mark. In the afternoon, it reached 603 taels and 2 cents. As a result, it retreated to within 599 taels. As for large amounts, they trended lower, and drafts suddenly shrank by as many as four levels. The shrinkage of the internal market was even more severe. Chinese merchants were more eager to sell than to buy, and the quoted price was suppressed by 90 taels to 84 or 5 taels. The next day, the silver market continued to be low, the drafts were clearly fixed but secretly loose, and the gold price was chaotic. There were ten taels of twists and turns. The market situation was already latent萎挫. It was always at 95 taels and a half. Before noon, it once reached 604 taels and a half. On Wednesday, the silver market and drafts rose together. However, the gold market had already increased by three taels. In the morning, it once fell to 88 taels and 6 cents. In the end, it returned to 98 or 9 taels. The next day, the silver market and foreign exchange had both shrunk back. However, the industry sold, and the gold price was turbulent. There were as many as 15 taels of ups and downs. The early count reached 606 taels. In the afternoon, due to the争售 of 福昌·天裕永·永康·泰興·元興永, the trend of the internal market was first松折 and suddenly降 to 91 taels. As a result, 95 taels still fell by 3 taels. On Friday, the old条回长, and the drafts were放长 by one level. The gold market once again游·复以先令等转挺不啻明萎暗坚. In the afternoon, it suddenly jumped up by seven or eight taels. It was rumoured that a certain bank was shipping cash for export, so it suddenly rushed out of 600 taels. As a result, 604 taels and 4 cents were already暗船 raised to 606 or 7 taels. By Saturday, the silver market had slightly shrunk, and the drafts had not changed. However, the internal market saw an advantage. The gold market soared. The industry was求过于供, and the short sellers were eager to advance. There was a great sign of飞黄腾达. In half a day, there was a change of twelve or thirteen taels. The amount was quite枯, and the unprecedented奇价 of 615 taels was suddenly discovered. In the end, it锐落 by more than two taels. The after-market price of 612 taels and a half was 37 taels stronger than on the 14th (the previous Saturday). The difference between the highest and lowest prices in this week was 26 taels and 4 cents, and the storms were fiercer than in the previous week. Now, the high and low prices of the British and American silver markets, drafts, and gold prices are listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Securities, Bond Market Prosperous Last Week <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Transactions Reach Over 77.7 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Bond Prices Change Greatly, Resulting in Mutual Rises and Falls</p>
<p>Last week, the public debt market in this port, the futures market was extremely prosperous from beginning to end. The liveliness of buying and selling was unprecedented this year. It is estimated that the turnover on Thursday was over 14.1 million, and on Friday it was over 10.8 million. The remaining days averaged around 13 million yuan, totaling over 77.7 million yuan, which is over 34.4 million yuan more than the previous week. Among them, large amounts of customs duty reorganisation were entering and leaving every day, and troop cuts were also far better than before. Even the consolidation of the Sixth and other items was quite lively. The spot market felt even more deserted, with the whole week only trading 73,600 yuan. Although the spot market for Sino-French US dollar bonds has been opened, there is not much spot circulation, and the market has no interest. As for the changing situation, at the beginning of the week, due to the tense situation and the unfavourable military situation in Hunan and Shandong, and at the same time, the Jin side suddenly implemented the takeover of the Tianjin Customs, the people were greatly shocked for a time, and speculators dumped and those who were timid to sell were very prevalent. Each bond price fell sharply one after another. Among them, reorganisation fell to as low as 478 yuan, and customs duty once fell to 58 yuan. Although it once rose in the middle, the trend was inclined and tired, and there was very little chance of reversal. At the end of the week, the market situation changed greatly. The situation in Hunan Province was optimistic, and there was no problem in northern Shandong. In addition, the central government also had considerable measures for the Tianjin Customs matter. The number of investors buying into the market increased sharply, and empty accounts were also engaged in补进. The bond prices rose sharply. As a result, customs duty reorganization and troop cuts each had about 6 yuan of change, and others also had ups and downs of two or three yuan. Compared with the previous week, only the spot prices of customs duty reorganization fell greatly, and the rest had mutual ups and downs. The ups and downs were very small. Now, the statistics of the highs and lows of each bond price last week are listed below (unit: yuan)</p>

<h3 id="e114">Weekly Yarn Market Summary of Yarn Flowers <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Unsettled Times Indeed Need Unblocking, Giving a Big Blow</p>
<p>Exchange Rates Extremely Tight, All Goods Skyrocket, Buyers' Foundation Also Strong</p>
<p>Long and Short Positions Hold Each Other, Resulting in a Brewing Situation</p>
<p>The yarn market was still relatively stable at the beginning of the week, with a slightly softer trend, mainly due to the sharp drop in Three White brand American cotton. The internal warfare caused transportation blockages, and actual sales stagnated, resulting in a bleak market. However, buyers, because of the extreme reduction in exchange rates and the skyrocketing prices of all goods, did not let go of the amount they absorbed. Therefore, there was no major change in the market situation, and both sides presented a stalemate. In general, the unsettled times and the lack of smooth actual demand inevitably affect the yarn market. At the beginning of the week, Ruida &amp; Co. found flaws in American cotton for standard yarn. The prices for all months were at their lowest, and about 20,000 bales of standard yarn were thrown out. However, the market price was not affected much. Most of them were bought by retail investors. As a result, the prices for all months fell by 3, 6, and 7 mace compared with the previous week. According to statistics, the total turnover for the week was 85,050 bales. Spot yarn was sluggish and stagnant. According to the statistics of purchases made by various groups throughout the week, 6,345 bales were bought, and 1,750 bales were purchased by the same industry. The market was trending weaker. The lowest price for Three White yarn reached 111 yuan. The purchase amounts of various groups are recorded below:</p>
<p>Group 　Bale Amount 　Group 　Bale Amount 　Group 　Bale Amount</p>
<p>Xuzhou 　155 　Fujian 　120 　Nanyang 　200</p>

<p>American Cotton Plummets, Weakened by the Damage</p>
<p>Gold Prices Jump Wildly, Slightly Elated</p>
<p>Major Players Dump, Again Encountering Obstruction</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Recovers Slightly</p>
<p>The Northern Situation is Complex and Chaotic, and Future Circumstances are Difficult to Predict. The cotton market was relatively weak due to the sharp drop in American cotton. Helplessly, the price of gold rose sharply again, which helped the buyers. The market situation was slightly stronger. Before long, the downward trend of American cotton was still fierce, and the 13.3-cent line in October was broken. At the same time, speculative major players vigorously dumped, with a huge amount of bales. For a time, they were overwhelmed and fell, greatly panicked. Soon, those who profited from American cotton covered their short positions and returned for three consecutive days, rising 50 points. Retail investors took the opportunity to snatch up short positions, and the market situation trended higher, but the cotton market was not as strong as it was before. As for the future, the situation is complicated and increasingly difficult to predict. The prices of forward cotton for each month fell by 1.5 to 5 mace compared with the previous week. The total turnover for the week was 238,600 piculs. According to the source at the pier, there were 3,200 piculs of Tong cotton and 4,710 piculs of Yao cotton. American cotton fell by 25 points compared with the previous week. Manufacturers imported 16,484 piculs, and firms imported 2,860 piculs. The amount purchased by manufacturers and firms is recorded below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, only ten or so Chang group boats arrived at the riverbank in Zhabei. No boats from the Xi group arrived. It is said that the boat has been on the way for a long time. Sales in this market are slightly weak. The authorities continue to investigate the market conditions of each stall. After the crazy jumps in the previous two markets, it has temporarily returned to stability. There is only mid-grade rice available for viewing from the riverbank for Northern Japonica rice. Top-grade rice is out of stock. The market price is generally 23 yuan, and the lowest is 21 yuan. The trend is still rising, not falling. The current situation is gradually stabilizing, and there is no chaos as in the previous two markets. There is very little thin rice in stock, and the liquidation price is holding firm. Yuan Rice has a slight amount arriving at the port. Top-grade rice still requires 20 yuan. The mid-grade price has increased by one or two jiao. The situation is very good. Pointed rice is still out of stock, and foreign rice sacks continue to arrive at the port. The general market sentiment is extremely firm since the settlement of foreign rice. Inlanders are also paying attention to it. There is no hope for the Japonica rice market to relax.</p>
<p>A small amount of various stalls arrived at the riverbank in South Shanghai, and the market is unusually stable. Top-grade Northern Japonica rice is still lacking. Although mid-grade rice is available on the market, it seems that merchants are hoarding it. The situation here is more peaceful than in Zhabei, but the market price is no less than that in the North City. Ordinary Japonica rice requires more than 21 yuan. All Japonica rice transactions are unremarkable. Goods from Chang, Xi, Su, and Tong are slightly visible for the thin rice in the South Road. Early rice is out of stock, and the price is higher than before. According to this, goods may be received later, and the market is fairly stable. Tong Bian and Yin Hua are both declining, and sales are extremely brisk. Therefore, the standard price of Yuan Rice has also reached between 19 yuan and 45 jiao. Indica rice is almost non-existent. The market is completely based on foreign rice. The situation is very brisk.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Reasons for the Stagnation of Silk Sales Last Week <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Sluggish Sales of British and French Silk Fabrics, Artificial Silk Floods the Market and Competes for Sales</p>
<p>New York's Silk Sales Are Weak After the Implementation of the New Tariff Act</p>
<p>The Summer Silkworm Crop in the Mainland Is Not Good, and the Cost of Silk for Chinese Merchants Is Difficult to Relax</p>
<p>The transaction of Chinese silk last week almost came to a standstill. In previous years, after the new silk came on the market, European and American merchants would throw and purchase forward silk for each month, and the market would have a smooth period. This year, it is dying, and there is a tendency to be unable to recover. Since the surge in the gold market, the exchange rate of the shilling has changed repeatedly. The sales of British and French silk fabrics are sluggish. Silk factories have to use artificial silk to reduce costs due to concerns about the unemployment of workers. As a result, artificial silk floods the market and competes for sales. Last week, there were only sporadic spot transactions of Chinese and Japanese raw silk. Since the implementation of the new tariff act in New York, the stock market has plummeted, and a major panic has occurred in the economic world. Raw silk factories cannot sell, and silk prices fall frequently. Overseas silk cables are not transferred. Chinese silk merchants believe that the summer silkworm crop in the mainland has suffered damage due to the weather. The Zhejiang cocoons are in short supply, and the price of cocoons is increasingly high. Silkworm diseases are rampant in Jiangsu Province, and a bumper harvest is unlikely. In the future, the raw materials will be scarce, and the cost of silk will still be difficult to lower. Selling at a loss is impossible due to the situation, and European and American merchants are also watching from the sidelines. This is the general reason for the stagnation of silk sales last week. Last week, more than one hundred bales of spot silk were traded, and more than one thousand bales of old silk were sold. Western firms cleared their old silk, and 400 pieces of new silk were shipped to France. Overseas Chinese silk is uniformly sold at a low price.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Southern and Northern Goods and Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber Arrivals Are Blocked, and the Trend Is Brisk <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the source of Sichuan pickled mustard tuber has been cut off due to traffic obstructions there. The goods stored here have been opened to 31 or 32 yuan by merchants. However, now they want to increase the price under the pretext of the temporary interruption of the source. The trend is particularly tight. As for sales destinations such as Guangdong and Shantou, digestion is quite smooth. Secondly, inland markets are also continuous. The firms sell at 28 or 29 yuan, and the secondary firms sell at 25 or 26 yuan. Good-quality goods from special firms are also sold for more than 30 yuan. The market situation will also tend to rise afterward, as the merchants' market is tight.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Sugar Market Is Experiencing a Sharp Rise in Dutch Red Sugar <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Coarse Sand and White Sugar See Slight Stability</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market happened to be Sunday, and there were no telegrams from the production area as usual. The coarse sand and white sugar atmosphere of the guild was slightly stable. Initially, the sellers asked for eight taels, but the buyers were unusually quiet. Only retail investors had a slight intention to buy, and the transaction price was seven taels and nine and a half qian, with no rise or fall compared to the previous day. No. 20 medium sand white sugar was seven taels and eight and a half qian, and the transaction was very balanced. Dutch red sugar transactions were quite brisk, and the market saw a gradual increase. No. 10 goods were priced at six taels six qian to six qian and a half, and No. 12 goods were six taels and seven and a half qian, up to eight qian. The market was also very beautiful. Japan Sugar Minghua YRO mark was one tael and one qian and a half, YT mark was eight taels and three qian and a half, and YP mark was eight taels and five qian and a half. Transactions were active. Later, the sellers called for five points higher, and the buyers were few. Only YP mark was traded at eight taels and six qian. The market image was firm and stable. The whole Cuban Ocean was quoted at seven taels and two qian, and there was no transaction. There is a rumor that the factory ice has risen in price. There is a lot of water in the slag ice market, and the price of the market stock has followed the increase, with some calling for up to twelve taels, but there is little hope of a transaction. Ju Delong &amp; Co. sold more than 6,400 bags of No. 2 Xiao Lüqing, priced at seven taels and one qian, which was also quite firm.</p>

<h3 id="e126">News of the Labor Strike of French Concession Water and Electricity Workers Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Labor's Attitude Is Resolute, Requesting Assistance from All Sectors</p>
<p>The Employer Still Has No Response, and the Strike Is Difficult to End Immediately</p>
<p>The labor strike of the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Union has been recorded in this newspaper. In recent days, the employer still has no response, and the attitude of all workers is extremely resolute. They hold meetings every day to discuss the negotiation policy. The news from yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The police maintain order. Initially, the Public Security Bureau, not understanding the ins and outs of the case, often ordered the Second District and Liyuan Road police stations to prevent the meeting before receiving a notice from the Municipal Party Department. It has been heard that the Social Bureau has notified the Public Security Bureau that the union workers have a labor dispute, and the Social Bureau has summoned both parties for mediation, but the employer refused to attend and did not accept the mediation. Now they can only listen to the union meeting to discuss the method. Therefore, the police station in charge received this notice yesterday and sent police to the union to maintain order at any time. It is also learned that the union, in view of the strike period, is deeply afraid that reactionary elements will take the opportunity to incite workers and disrupt and sabotage the labor movement. It specifically sent a letter to the local Public Security Bureau police station to order the police chief to go to the union to strictly prevent this.</p>
<p>Re-requesting the mutual assistance of Chinese staff. The union previously sent a letter to all Chinese staff in the factory requesting unanimous assistance to the workers. For several days, the Chinese staff has not expressed anything. Yesterday, they sent another letter of persuasion, the original letter said: (Abbreviated above) Our union previously sent a letter requesting that you assist our union workers. I hope you can see clearly. However, for three days, there has been no clear indication, which is a loss of the spirit of love and mutual assistance among our Chinese compatriots. I still remember that you had intended to negotiate with the employer on a certain matter and had instructed our union workers to express mutual assistance. Although the matter was not carried out, the words are still in my ears. Then you and our union workers are not only in the same situation, but also have a considerable relationship of alliance in the historical process. How can you bear to sit idly by while our seven hundred workers are rejected by the employer and not lend a hand? Therefore, I send another letter requesting that you express your attitude immediately to assist our compatriots. The workers will be very fortunate, and our union will be very fortunate.</p>
<p>Requesting solidarity from all sectors. Yesterday, the union issued a letter requesting solidarity from party departments and unions at all levels in the city, as follows: All party departments and unions at all levels in the Shanghai Special Municipality are aware that imperialists are using all means to carry out economic aggression in China. They set up factories in China and let them fish for profits, hire our Chinese workers as their slaves, and exploit the meager wages earned by seven people's sweat and blood, leaving nothing behind and allowing them to be destroyed. The groans and pains of the workers are not taken care of. The workers of our union have recently been unable to maintain their lives due to the soaring rice prices, so they had to ask the employer to increase their wages to maintain their poor lives every day. The conditions put forward are all within the scope and have been announced in the newspaper long ago, and have been approved by the higher-level party department, and the Social Bureau has been approved to convene labor and management to mediate. However, on the day the Social Bureau convened mediation, the employer intentionally absented, and there is no doubt that they are oppressing the workers, despising the government, and despising the union. In anger, the workers of our union convened a members' meeting at any time and resolved to go on strike, hoping to promote the employer's awakening. Who knew that the capitalists of the imperialists would become even more intensified. When the workers entered the factory on the second day, a few workers were expelled and the iron gate was closed, refusing to allow them to enter the factory, regarding the workers as meat on the chopping block or worse. The workers of our union are in this environment of oppression. In fact, there is no need to strike, and it has become a strike phenomenon. It is necessary to know that this strike is purely the creation of the imperialist employers. Our seven hundred workers are already like walking on thin ice, like being on the edge of a deep abyss, in extreme danger. I hope that party departments and unions at all levels will unanimously support us, so that the imperialist capitalists can finally realize their mistakes and save our seven hundred workers from fire and water. I am deeply and urgently praying for this.</p>

<p>The steamboat and timber industry workers in this city, totaling more than 2,000 people, have recently demanded an increase in rice subsidies of six yuan per person per month due to high rice prices and expensive firewood, but the steamboat companies and contractors have not responded. Therefore, they have gone on strike one after another since yesterday and have submitted a petition to the higher-level authorities, waiting for mediation.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Soldiers Must Have Car Passes to Take the Train <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force issued a notice yesterday and posted it at various stations, saying: For the sake of issuing a notice, it has been found that soldiers taking the train on official business have always been issued Type A and B car passes by the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs to show preferential treatment. However, recently, soldiers taking the train often do not use these car passes, but instead use passports or notes to force their way onto the train. If this is not strictly prohibited, it will not only affect the income of the Railway Bureau, but also greatly hinder military discipline. In the future, soldiers taking the train on official business must uniformly hold Type A and B car passes and may not use passports or notes instead. If anyone dares to violate this deliberately, once found, in addition to being ordered to make up the ticket according to the railway regulations, they shall also be severely punished. This notice is hereby issued. All soldiers taking the train must comply and not violate it. Sincerely, sincerely.</p>

<p>Imported Goods Plummet</p>
<p>Exported Goods Show Minimal Increase</p>
<p>Recently, the foreign trade of this port, both imports and exports, has been greatly affected by the gold and silver market, with imports experiencing the most significant decline. According to investigations, the total value of imported goods in this port for May was 42,000,000 Haikwan Taels, while exports amounted to 36,000,000 Taels. The total figures from January to May show imports at 247,000,000 Taels and exports at 197,000,000 Taels. In comparison, the total value of imported goods during the same period last year was 274,000,000 Haikwan Taels, and exports totaled 190,000,000 Taels. Comparing the two periods, imports have decreased by as much as 27,000,000 Taels.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Memorial Service for Fan ZhengLuo <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Held Yesterday at the City Party Headquarters</p>
<p>The late Kuomintang member, Martyr Fan ZhengLuo, was murdered along with his relatives and friends at his residence in the Hehefang area of Avenue Joffre last November 11th, causing a great stir at the time. All parties expressed their grief. Subsequently, Liu Jiwu, Zhu Jiarang, Yi Zuanren, Cai Zhiqing, Wang Doyan, Chen Kecheng, Zhu Yingpeng, Fan Ningshu, Wang Xingyong, Xiao Jinfan, Chen Baolian, Feng Zhiyou, Gao Yunlu, Gu Zhenzhong, and Liu Tianpeng, friends and relatives of the deceased during his lifetime, initiated a memorial service, which was held yesterday on the third floor of the City Party Headquarters. Over 500 people attended. The preparatory committee, consisting of Zhu Yingpeng, Chen Kecheng, and Xiao Jinfan, presided over the meeting, with Zhu Jiarang as the recorder and Yi Zuanren as the master of ceremonies. Other members of the preparatory committee served as ushers. Chairman Chen Kecheng reported, stating briefly, "Comrade Fan ZhengLuo was murdered last November 11th, causing great grief to comrades throughout the city and compatriots from all walks of life. Today, as we commemorate Comrade Fan ZhengLuo, we should consider three aspects: first, recall the situation during Comrade Fan's lifetime; second, recall the circumstances of his death; and third, express our feelings of grief. Because I, as a brother, worked with the deceased for a long time, I am more familiar with the various circumstances and can report a few points. Comrade Fan was very brave from a young age. Since leaving school, he followed Comrade Zhengbo in the revolution, demonstrating his brave spirit everywhere. When he was in the investigation section of the city's training department, where I was also in charge, the reactionary forces of the communists outside the party were very rampant. Other comrades with less courage were often intimidated by this, but Comrade Fan often said to me that the responsibility of our investigation section was to investigate corruption within the party.</p>
<p>Deterioration, and to resolutely restrain anti-party forces outside the party. Therefore, whenever the reactionaries took any action, Comrade Fan would report it to other comrades or make his own determination. However, Comrade Fan later felt that although his work within the party was very active, his inability to take direct action to restrain the reactionaries was a regret. Therefore, he resolutely transferred to the Public Security Bureau, thinking to do more practical work. Since joining the bureau, he, of course, fulfilled his long-cherished aspirations, and he went forward bravely and freely, eliminating reactionaries, always expressing his brave spirit, resolute and decisive attitude, and determination to struggle and sacrifice. But very sadly, at a time when society and the country needed this kind of talent, his strong suppression in peacetime provoked the jealousy of the reactionaries. Of course, the reactionaries' plan was not directed at him alone, but Comrade Fan ZhengLuo was eventually sacrificed, and this is how painful it is for us. Secondly, we think about the circumstances of Comrade Fan's death. Although I was not at the scene at the time, I heard from Comrade Zhengbo and others afterwards that a guest had come to his house that night, and just as the guest was about to leave and Comrade Zhengbo was about to see him off, the communist bandits had already ambushed at the door. At that time, Comrade ZhengLuo was behind, just leaving the door, when he suddenly heard two loud bangs. Knowing there was a change, he rushed out to resist the reactionaries, but in the end, he was killed by the enemy's malicious bullets, groaning in the middle of a pool of blood and died. We think if he was not brave, this would not have happened, because he was very brave and sacrificed himself. We are very sad about the death of Comrade Fan, but we have not had the opportunity to vent to the public since last November 12th. Although everyone often talks about it among friends, everyone is saddened, and even when eating and sleeping, we often remember Comrade Fan's life, the happy situation of gathering together. Comrade Fan took the revolution as his second life. He never talked about boring things or did boring things. He not only preached revolution, but also practiced it. His revolution has had real achievements, but he also did not always publicize or exaggerate to everyone, which is his virtue and what we, the surviving revolutionary comrades, should strive to do. Comrade Fan ZhengLuo sacrificed for the revolution. We, the surviving comrades, are gathered here today, feeling very sad. On the one hand, we mourn the misfortune of the party, the country, and society, the loss of such a revolutionary activist, and on the other hand, we feel that our responsibility is even greater. We should not shirk this responsibility. We should find an opportunity to avenge Comrade Fan and complete the unfinished business of Comrade Fan," and so on. The following is a summary of the speeches of the attendees: (1) Chen Dezheng, Executive Committee Member of the City, said, "It is comforting from the perspective of the deceased that he sacrificed his life for righteousness, because Comrade ZhengLuo's strength lies in his spirited, courageous, and uncompromising spirit, and his fearlessness of death. Therefore, sacrificing his life for righteousness was almost within his expectations. We who are his friends cannot avoid being saddened in terms of human feelings, but at this time of rampant reaction, we should rise up and take it as our responsibility to eliminate the reactionaries." (2) Yu Hongjun, representative of the mayor, said, "Comrade Fan was a capable and intelligent talent of our party, and especially his uncompromising, resolute, and brave spirit has always been admired. Now that he has given his life for the party, we have a hundred feelings and are extremely saddened. Fortunately, all comrades will continue his spirit from now on to complete his unfinished will." (3) Yuan Liang, Director of the Public Security Bureau, said, "Comrade Fan came to the Public Security Bureau to handle affairs. I saw his brave spirit at his home and asked him to come. Not long after he started, his spirit was fully expressed. Everyone is very sad today at the memorial service, but I feel that the Public Security Bureau has lost a good helper in the future and feels more responsible. In the future, I will work harder under the leadership of the party to eliminate the rebels to repay the party and the country and to comfort Comrade Fan's spirit under the spring." (4) Tao Baichuan, Executive Committee Member of the City, said, "Today, Comrade Fan's friends are holding a memorial service, but in a few days, the City Party Headquarters will also hold a larger memorial service to express their condolences. Comrade Fan has many strengths, and his brave spirit is most admirable. Today, the voices of reaction outside the party have not subsided, and it is even sadder to come to commemorate Comrade Fan." (5) Wei Bokuan, Executive Committee Member of the City, said, "We learn two lessons from Comrade Fan's murder: First, the concession has no guarantee for the lives of Chinese people, and it should be taken back as soon as possible. Second, we must not be lenient with the reactionaries' ruthless methods." (6) Pan Gongzhan, Executive Committee Member of the City, said, "The Communist Party's reactionaries never talk about benevolence and righteousness. They have no motherland or race, only class. They are so ruthless to people of the same race, which is hateful. We should deeply recognize this in the future and must not be lenient when dealing with them. We must know that the Prime Minister's spirit of generosity and fraternity must not be thrown at them." (7) Liu Tianpeng, a member of the preparatory committee, said in his speech, "To commemorate Comrade Fan, we should recognize his spirit from his words and deeds and continue his will." The French police have not arrested the murderer yet, and we should urge them to solve the case as soon as possible. Fan Zhengbo, a member of the family, gave a reply, stating briefly, "I am too sad today to report, please forgive me," and said with tears in her voice, and the whole audience was silent. The attached eulogy said, "You lived as a hero of the party and died as a martyr of the party. You struggled for the revolution throughout your life and were attacked by villains. You have no regrets in becoming a martyr. The hot blood of a man can be seen by the Prime Minister's spirit in heaven and can inspire those who die after. Thinking of the stealth of the murderers, knowing the stubbornness and cunning of the imperialists, and now the thieves of the marshes are raising the mausoleums and stealing the treasures. The vast Central Plains is covered by haze. If you have knowledge underground, you should not close your eyes and believe in the ultimate victory of the doctrine, destroy all the remnants of reaction, and store the great flag of Qingbai to lay the party and the country on a solid rock, so that the heroic spirits should be in Jiuyuan. I hereby announce its arrival, Shangxiang."</p>
<h3 id="e132">Liu Zuhan's Talk <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zuhan, the newly appointed commander of the Jiangbei Guerrilla Forces by the Central Government, was sworn in at the Pingjiang Public Office in Zhabei on the 19th. The reporter specially visited Liu at his residence on Luban Road in the French Concession the day before yesterday, asking when he would go to Jiangbei in person, where the headquarters would be set up, and what the organizational structure would be. Liu answered one by one (the following are all in Liu's words): "I originally intended to set off immediately after taking office this time, but the deployment of tickets has not been fully prepared, and it will be delayed by about one star before I can set off. The headquarters will be temporarily set up in Yangzhou. As for all the organizational structures, I cannot predict them at the moment, because the army in Jiangbei is extremely complex, and there are many gangs of bandits. I intend to use both suppression and appeasement. Therefore, since the announcement of my appointment, there must be several people a day who have returned to allegiance. However, in order to prevent someone from making a statement in disguise outside, I absolutely do not appoint a single person in Shanghai. After I arrive in Jiangbei, I must conduct a detailed and careful review one by one, and then engage in compilation, before I can have a concrete grasp." After speaking, visitors came in an endless stream, and the reporter resigned.</p>
<p>Ninth District Party Headquarters</p>
<h3 id="e133">Opposing the Violation of Treaty Rights by Western Consuls <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The National Society said, "The Ninth District Party Headquarters of this city, in order to oppose the destruction of treaties and infringement of legal rights by the Spanish Consul, issued a declaration, the original text of which reads, "Yesterday, it was reported in the newspapers that the Russian merchant Robin Foreign Company of this city accused the Spanish Wangdetang Mayor of a case. When the court summoned him in the special district court, the defendant deliberately failed to appear, which was obviously contemptuous of Chinese laws and regulations. He should have been summoned and detained. Originally, in order to uphold the relationship between the two countries, he was treated with leniency, but he did not realize it and was protested by the Spanish Consul, which suspended the trial. It was found that Article 2 of the Sino-Spanish Treaty of Amity and Commerce, signed in Nanjing on December 27, 17th year of the Republic of China, detailed, "The people of this contracting state shall be subject to the laws and courts of the other contracting state within the territory of the other contracting state, but for the exercise and defense of their rights, they shall have the freedom and convenience to petition the courts." There is also an official statement from Spanish country China Minister Youlide to our country at the same time, stating that the Spanish government fully agrees to all of Article 2 of the Sino-Spanish Treaty of Amity and Commerce signed and will take effect on January 1, 19th year of the Republic of China, which is on file. Now, suddenly, in accordance with the abolished consular jurisdiction, it obstructs the progress of the court's trial, violates the treaty, and damages the country's reputation and credit. Especially, it infringes on our country's exercise of legal rights and jurisdiction. The court can legally reject its unreasonable protest and dispose of the default judgment to show the majesty of our country's laws and prevent future occurrences. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should make a serious protest and warn it to abide by the credit of the treaty in order to maintain the friendship between China and Spain. If the court believes that a diplomatic incident has occurred and considers it important, and the case is suspended invisibly, it will not only lose the exercise of legal rights within the territory, but also leave foreigners saying that we are weak and incompetent, and the future of the judiciary will have one more hidden reef. The people of the country should pay attention together, not be taken advantage of by foreigners, and urge the party authorities to resist according to law, so as not to fall into an irrecoverable situation. This is a declaration."</p>

<p>County Consolidation Committee Petition</p>
<h3 id="e136">Denying Yan Feng's Private Foreign Debt <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Affairs Consolidation Committee submitted a document to the Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee yesterday, requesting that the central government be requested to deny Yan Feng's private foreign debt in order to maintain national rights. The Jiangning County Chamber of Commerce Association Consolidation Committee replied by telegram, saying that the Tongshan County Chamber of Commerce Association and the entire members of various industry district associations had replied by telegram (abridged): "The country will never hold national debt unless it is absolutely necessary to give the country a burden and repeat the people's burden. Even if it is held, the use of the debt, the method of repayment, and the agreement on the interest rate must be carefully studied in advance so as not to lose sovereignty, not to harm the people, and to be resolved by high-level meetings and executed by the National Government before proceeding. Only in this way can the malpractices be eliminated and not be allowed by anyone. For the sake of their own self-interest, they can arbitrarily hold them regardless of the country's gains and losses and the people's well-being. Now Yan Feng and the two traitors sacrifice the lives and property of tens of millions of people in the northwest to betray the party and the country, and make a last-ditch effort. Their ferocious and evil ugliness is fully exposed. Recently, because the butcher knife is not working and the military salary is being eaten away, they know that the road to death is not far away and they are unable to cover up. They have restarted the old tricks of the warlords, using national rights as collateral and the lives of the people as collateral, colluding with imperialism, and privately borrowing foreign debt to prolong internal strife, and plunder the people's wealth, poison the people. Our association is a leader in the business community, and how dare we lag behind in patriotism. We are determined to oppose the private national debt of the rebellious and other people to the death. In addition to leading thousands of revolutionary businessmen in Tongshan to make a thorough struggle, we would like to send a telegram to express our support. We hope that our comrades throughout the country will unite to oppose it and vow not to recognize it so that the rebels can be wiped out as soon as possible and peace can be realized soon. etc. It should be checked that Yan Feng and the two rebels are in chaos and disturbing the country, and the people are angry. Now they are going against the tide, colluding with imperialism, privately borrowing foreign debt, and making our people suffer. We should unite to oppose it and vow not to recognize it, and hope that everyone will unite to advocate it, in the hope that the association's 23rd meeting put forward the discussion, and it was resolved that everyone advocated that it be filed for the record. For this reason, we have prepared a document to submit to your association, hoping to be transferred to the Central Government, and inform all countries to declare that they will not recognize it in order to maintain national rights, and the expectation is extremely high."</p>

<h3 id="e148">Escaping from a Bandit Den by Shooting <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>An Old Wet Nurse with Sinister Intentions</p>
<p>A Honey Trap in a Circus</p>
<p>Wang Changyan Imprisoned in the East Wing</p>
<p>Seizing a Gun and Frightening Away a Gang of Bandits</p>
<p>Gu Yin Wang Mao, a military man. When Wang Zhanyuan was Governor of Hubei, he served as the commander of the 18th Division. After Wang's defeat, he retired to his hometown, enjoying his life in seclusion, like a feudal lord. His second son, Changyan, is married and 23 years old. He has been studying law in Shanghai for many years and will graduate this summer and return home. However, due to an occasional indiscretion, he ended up in a bandit den and narrowly escaped disaster. The one who lured and kidnapped him was the wet nurse, Wang, who had served him for many years. Wang was kidnapped at 10:00 PM the night before last night and escaped at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Although he was in the hands of the bandits for less than 20 hours, his experiences before and after were fantastic, making it an interesting case among the kidnapping cases in Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Young Master Meets the Wet Nurse. Wang Changyan studies at the local School of Political Science and Law, commuting from his rented dormitory at No. 270, Xinxin Lane, Jin Shenfu Road. Four weeks ago, while strolling in the Great World, he suddenly met his wet nurse, Pan Jinmei. The master and servant met unexpectedly. Pan introduced herself to Wang, calling him Young Master and asking how he was living in Shanghai. Wang replied that he was studying at school and would graduate soon and return to Ningbo. Pan repeatedly agreed and said that she now lived at No. 407, Shanhai Guan Road, and would be happy to be at his service if needed.</p>
<p>Occasional Visits Lead to Meeting a Man. After meeting Aunt Pan, Wang often sent clothes to her for washing, about three or four times. Each time, he met a man who claimed to be Gao Shaogu, a close relative according to Aunt Pan, but actually her lover. Because of his relationship with the wet nurse, Wang often used gentle language. The day before yesterday evening, Wang went again and told Pan that he had nothing to do in Shanghai and was packing his luggage to return to Ningbo the next day. He asked if she would like to visit the old house again. Pan replied that she was afraid of traveling by sea and could not serve the young master. Gao, who was also present, suddenly said to Wang that if he could set off on Monday (today), the matter would be settled because he also wanted to return to his hometown to visit relatives. Gao was from Cixi. Wang nodded, thinking that staying in Shanghai for another day or two would not hurt.</p>
<p>The Three Go to the Circus. Gao heard Wang's words and postponed his departure, seemingly overjoyed, saying that staying in Shanghai for two more days would be a great opportunity for sightseeing. He said that the circus performance in the newspaper was amazing and worth seeing, but he was always busy and had no time to enjoy it. The circus was performing at the intersection of Carter Road. Wang had often passed by Pan's house and had long wanted to go. Hearing Gao's words, he was immediately excited and said that if the wet nurse and Gao were willing, they should go. So the three of them went to the circus.</p>
<p>A Beautifully Dressed Woman Is Met in the Circus. Wang, Aunt Pan, and Gao entered the circus and found seats. Suddenly, they saw a smiling woman nearby. Pan greeted her, saying, "You are here too?" Her tone suggested that it was an unexpected encounter, but it was actually a lure. She introduced Wang to the woman, and Pan told Wang about the woman and praised her beauty. After the show, as they were leaving, Pan tugged at Wang's sleeve and said that the woman's residence was not far away and it was not yet late, so why not visit her house. Gao also encouraged him to go. Wang did not say anything, nor did he refuse. So they hired rickshaws and went to Gengqing Lane, Xinzha Road.</p>
<p>Upon Entering the Room, the Situation Becomes Tense. When they arrived at Gengqing Lane, it was around 10:00 PM. The residence was at No. 689, and the alley was clean, not like a place where vulgar people would live, so Wang felt at ease and was calm. Then, they went upstairs into the east wing. Wang suddenly saw three or four burly men in the room, and the furnishings did not seem like those of good people. Wang began to suspect something. When he heard the people in the room speak, he almost screamed in panic, but a gun was already pointed at his chest. Wang knew that if he made a sound, he would be in danger, so he tried to stay calm and observe the situation, but nothing happened. They only told him to stay put and be quiet.</p>
<p>Four Burly Men Share the Bed. Wang had been sleeping alone in his dormitory for a long time. That night, there were suddenly four men in the room, sharing the bed with him, which made him uncomfortable. He tossed and turned all night and could not fall asleep. He occasionally heard the guards talking, but he could not understand much. He knew that he had been sold by Aunt Pan. Fortunately, the four men were tired in the morning, and two other burly men replaced them. Wang knew that even if he had wings, he could not fly away, and he saw that they all had weapons on their waists, so he dared not even think about it.</p>
<p>A Plan Is Conceived When Feigning Sleep. The food served at noon was not bad. After the meal, Wang leaned on the couch and pretended to be asleep. One of the bandits went downstairs, leaving only one person in the room, pacing around the bed, guarding him closely. Wang suddenly had an idea and pretended to go to sleep. He closed his eyes tightly, pretending to be fast asleep, and snoring in his throat, as if he were sleeping soundly. The bandit thought that it was normal to take a nap after a meal and seemed to relax a bit. Suddenly, Wang felt a strong urge to urinate. He did not have time to leave the room, so he used the spittoon next to the small couch Wang was lying on. Although his movements were very light, Wang heard it clearly.</p>
<p>Eyes Quickly Seize Gun and Fire. Because of his need to relieve himself, the bandit took the gun from his waist and placed it on the edge of the bed. Wang quickly jumped up, but the bandit was immediately alerted. He quickly abandoned the spittoon and rushed out the door. Wang held the gun in his hand and shot at him, firing three shots. The bandits downstairs heard the alarm and ran back upstairs, firing at Wang. Fortunately, they could not hit him in their haste, and Wang was unharmed. He shouted for help loudly and urgently. The bandits were terrified and ran downstairs, escaping with a female bandit, said to be Wang's wet nurse, Pan Jinmei.</p>
<p>Bandits Return Fire and Wound a Woman. Wang's cries for help and the sound of gunfire were heard outside. The Indian police guarding the alley immediately closed the gate and rushed to the police station to report the emergency. However, they did not know the details and only reported a theft. The Gordon Road Police Station immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives, who arrived very quickly. However, the bandits had already taken advantage of this very short opportunity to escape from the back door opposite No. 689, firing their guns as a warning. A woman was wounded by a stray bullet, and the bandits escaped without a trace.</p>
<p>Traces of Blood on the Stairs. When the Chinese and foreign detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station arrived at the scene, they found several shell casings scattered on the ground, and there were also traces of blood on the stairs, suggesting that one of the bandits had been injured before escaping. When they entered the east wing, Wang had already raised his hands in surrender, and the gun he used to shoot the bandits was lying on the table. The detectives saw that Wang was about twenty years old, wearing a blue silk gown, looking thin with a hint of panic on his face. When they questioned him, they found that he was a student. The detectives were amazed when they heard his story of how he had escaped by shooting the bandits.</p>
<p>The Landlord Talks About Renting the House. Although the bandits who kidnapped Wang had escaped, the police were making every effort to investigate. It was said that the bandits had gone to rent the house on the 19th and moved in the next morning with their family and household items, which were not too frugal. The landlord did not suspect anything. The only slightly different thing was that more men came and went, but they were not visiting relatives or friends, and there were some suspicious things when they went upstairs. No one but the bandits knew that Wang Changyan was imprisoned in the east wing. Their tactics were extraordinary.</p>
<p>First Five Months of the Year</p>
<h3 id="e149">Shanghai's Foreign Trade <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Pessimistic Information Predominates</p>
<p>Both Imports and Exports Are Sluggish</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Deputy Consul in Shanghai, Kato, the total foreign trade volume of Shanghai from January to May this year, imports were about 247 million Haikwan taels, and exports were about 197 million Haikwan taels, compared with the import volume of 274 million taels and the export volume of 190 million taels in the same period last year. Imports decreased by 27 million taels, and exports increased by 7 million taels. It is worth noting that the import of rice this year is much higher than in previous years, indicating that the import of general goods is much less than last year. The decrease in imports after April is due to the implementation of gold import duties starting from February 1st, especially the increase in the conversion rate starting from March 16th. More imports were made in the first two or three months, which led to a decrease in imports in April and May. In addition, poor harvests, deteriorating political situation, interrupted inland transportation, rampant bandits, and the concentration of silver dollars in Shanghai led to financial obstruction in the interior, drastic changes in exchange rates, and the impact of low prices in Japan. These are also the reasons for the sluggish imports. On the export side, due to the low silver price, operations are profitable, and there has been a slight increase since March and April. However, major items such as raw silk, tea, and cotton, although operations are profitable due to drastic changes in the silver price, the actual transactions are not as expected. However, the export of raw silk is less due to seasonal factors and scarce inventory. The export of fertilizers is also not prosperous due to the weak market conditions in Japan. As for other ports, Dalian and Qingdao are as usual, while Hankou and Tianjin are extremely sluggish due to the impact of the political situation. In short, China's foreign trade in the first half of this year is expected to decrease by 10% to 15% in imports compared with last year, and exports will increase slightly. The total imports and exports will decrease by about 10%.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Fewer Criminal Cases Last Week <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the number of criminals arrested by the Public Concession police last week was greatly reduced compared with the previous week, and the number of criminal cases was also less. There were only a few major cases. However, after several weeks of peace, armed robbery resumed its activities. There were reports of shops, residents, and pedestrians being robbed from time to time. A total of six robbery suspects were arrested this week. All of them were found to have guns when they were arrested. Two of them have been identified as repeat offenders. A total of seven pickpockets were arrested, all of whom were repeat offenders. Twelve robbers were arrested, eight of whom were also repeat offenders.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Timber Boat Lost at Sea <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Investigation Reveals It Was Dismantled by Nanhui Residents</p>
<p>The timber boat Jin Wanfeng, loaded with various timber worth more than 10,000 taels from Fujian, arrived at the Lihong pier in Wusong last month. The boat suddenly leaked and could not move forward. The crew members, fearing that the boat would sink, took small boats to escape ashore and reported to the boat owner, who hired a tugboat to tow the boat, but the boat had disappeared. After investigation, the boat owner found out that the timber boat had drifted to the Wutuan sea area in Nanhui County due to the wind. The nearby residents saw that it was a drifting timber boat and no one came to claim it, so they robbed all the timber and completely dismantled the boat. The Fuzhou Liangzhe Timber Merchants Association learned that the boat had encountered danger and, according to the law, anyone must protect it. Now, both the boat and the goods have been robbed and dismantled, with a loss of about 20,000 gold. The residents of that area have no regard for the law. A letter was sent to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce a few days ago to investigate the truth and provide assistance. After receiving the letter, the Wusong Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Nanhui County Government yesterday, requesting a thorough investigation, strict punishment according to the law, and compensation for the goods to protect shipping merchants and warn against similar acts.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Tenants of Chungeng Lane Oppose Rent Increase <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The houses in the Chungeng Lane area of the Public Concession's West Chessboard Street, east to Henan Road, west to Shandong Road, south to Avenue Edward VII, and north to Jinlong Street, including municipal houses, number in the hundreds and are owned by Zhou Weishi. Recently, a notice was suddenly issued requiring a 30% rent increase. The tenants were alarmed because the houses were newly built and the rent had already doubled. Now that the economy is sluggish and the cost of living is high, it is impossible to bear the additional burden. They are now preparing to organize the Chungeng Lane Tenants' Union to resist the increase.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Zhabei Health Movement Conference <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>To be held on Qiujiang Road on the 28th and 29th</p>
<p>The China Children's Welfare Association, in view of the fact that the Zhabei area has rarely had health movement activities, and the general residents lack health knowledge, resulting in frequent diseases and numerous deaths, has joined forces with the Party Department, the Health Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, the Public Works Bureau Health Department, the Health Education Association, and hospitals, schools, and businesses to hold a conference on June 28th and 29th at Chang'anli, East End of Qiujiang Road, Gonghe Xin Road, with the association's Children's Health Care Clinic and Children's Education and Welfare Institute as the venues. The program is as follows: (1) Exhibition, (2) Student parade, (3) Distribution of health leaflets, (4) Opening of free clinics, (5) Examination of children's health, (6) Children's bathing, (7) Vaccination, (8) Injection of cholera vaccine, (9) Lectures, (10) Slide show and movie.

<h3 id="e154">As Director of the Wusong Injured Soldiers Hospital <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Wusong Zhang Huabang Naval Hospital's old site was converted into an injured soldiers hospital, as reported in this newspaper. It is learned that the old building of the Naval Hospital has been hired by Major Adjutant Jin Yuxi, dispatched by the Garrison Command to Song, to repair the building together with the Wusong Chamber of Commerce. The construction will be completed gradually. It is said that the position of the director of the injured soldiers hospital has been internally decided to be taken by Mrs. Gu Zhujun, the wife of Garrison Commander Xiong Shihui. All the equipment in the hospital is striving for perfection. According to reliable sources, Commander Xiong intends to go to Zhang Huabang with his wife, Mrs. Gu Zhujun, by car today or tomorrow to inspect the hospital in order to be cautious.</p>
<p>Labor Hospital</p>
<h3 id="e155">Planning to Establish Two Branch Hospitals <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Nanshi and Pudong</p>
<p>The Shanghai Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road in this city recently limited all its wards to accommodate ordinary patients. As the summer season is approaching, the number of epidemic patients will inevitably increase. If preventive measures are not widely planned, how can we achieve the effect of rescuing and returning to life? Therefore, it is planned to select a convenient location with many workers in Nanshi and Pudong, and set up an epidemic prevention department in each location, with special isolation wards for treatment. It is heard that the Nanshi location has been approved by the Civil Training Association to borrow the former site of the Student Union for processing, and is currently being repaired. It will be opened soon. As for the site of the Pudong branch, it is still under inspection.</p>
<p>Rice Boat</p>
<h3 id="e156">Dispute Over Mid-Journey Inspections <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Rice boat owners from the South Bund, including Ding Jisheng and others, recently transported rice to Shanghai. While passing Bridge No. 34 on the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line, they were suddenly ordered to stop by the stationed troops for inspection. After the inspection, they were forced to dock and were not allowed to proceed immediately. Ding argued, leading to him being beaten and injured. After the rice boats arrived in Shanghai and unloaded, most were unwilling to return to the interior for more cargo. The South Bund Rice Merchants Association sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, requesting them to forward the message to the relevant military authorities, ordering the troops stationed there to cancel inspections of rice boats passing through. Now, the rice merchants in the interior have loaded rice onto boats, but hearing that the rice boats are unwilling to transport it, they have sent representatives to Shanghai to request the Chamber of Commerce to petition the government to promptly cancel the inspections, so that rice boats can resume normal transport. At yesterday's Chamber of Commerce meeting, Chairman Yan reported that Ding Jisheng's boats and others were transporting rice to Shanghai when, while passing Bridge No. 34, they were suddenly ordered to stop by the stationed troops, who insisted on inspecting the boats. Ding argued, leading to him being beaten and injured. The boats were detained for a day before being released. Rice boats in Shanghai, hearing this, were alarmed and dared not return to load cargo. Consequently, many rice boats behind Ding's were turned back to the interior, afraid to pass through. The Chamber of Commerce had sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, requesting them to forward the message to the relevant military authorities, ordering the troops stationed there to cancel inspections of rice boats passing through. However, rice boats recently arriving in Shanghai reported that although they saw stationed troops while passing Bridge No. 34, they were not ordered to stop for inspection. It is believed that this matter arose from a misunderstanding. Currently, rice boats are passing through as usual. Please inform the rice businesses in the interior so that the rice boats will no longer be alarmed. Also, inform the rice boats in Shanghai to return to the interior to load cargo as soon as possible, and ask rice dealers to inform the rice businesses in the interior.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 22nd) was the eighth day after the opening of the first Public Art Exhibition in this city. The weather was sunny, and it was also Sunday, so the number of visitors was unprecedented since the opening. All day long, the area in front of the inner garden gate of the City God Temple was as crowded as Shanyin Road. The signing area was almost overwhelmed. There were over 28,000 people throughout the day. Many expatriates from countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and Japan also brought their companions to appreciate the art. Male and female writers such as Li Zuhan, Yan Ganyuan, He Mingzhai, Liang Yunqing, and Li Qiujun also attended, and painted several fan faces on the spot to leave their marks. The Wen Hua Monthly selected more than 50 pieces of work, intending to make copper plates and print them in various pictorial publications for publicity after the closing. Today (the 23rd) is the third day before the closing of the exhibition. If the weather is sunny, it is determined to close on schedule and not extend the exhibition.</p>

<p>Zhu Jixing, the deputy comprador of Yu Li Bank, embezzled a large sum of money from the bank and fled his post. Xie Tonghou and Yu Xiling, from the bank's private accounts, were accused of being involved in collusion and fraud and were detained for interrogation until Zhu was arrested. Xie and Yu were then released on bail, and Zhu was detained pending trial. This matter has been reported in the previous newspapers. The case was originally scheduled to be heard on Saturday morning by Judge Xu Jiashi of the Special District Court. The police brought Zhu to the court on the appointed date, and Xie and Yu, who were on bail, also appeared in court. However, Judge Xu took leave that day, and Judge Feng Shide took his place. Judge Feng stated that he was not in charge of the case and was not very clear about it, so he ordered a postponement until Judge Xu returned from leave. Zhu was taken back to the police station for detention.</p>

<p>Chen Gengming, a native of Taixing residing at No. 35 Dawang Temple Street in the South City, married the widow Ge Dai eight years ago. Ge brought with her a stepson, Ge Bingsi, who is now eighteen years old. Bingsi believed that his stepfather had ruined his mother's chastity and that his deceased father would not be happy about it, and he himself was unwilling to endure such humiliation. Therefore, he often clashed with his stepfather. Chen, suffering from this, discussed it with his wife, asking her to discipline the boy. However, she doted on her son and argued with Chen. Yesterday, another major conflict arose over this matter. Bingsi threw several rice bowls at his stepfather's head, causing a bloody mess. Chen, in unbearable pain, regretted raising a tiger that harmed him. He reported the incident to the police, who detained Ge and her son at the First District Police Station and transferred them to the District Court for investigation.</p>

<p>Ye A'san Destroys Property</p>
<p>Zhou Zhao Reports to the Police for Detention</p>
<p>Zhou Zhao, a woman from Nanjing, is 43 years old. She runs the Yongxianglou teahouse in Xuejia浜 in the South City. Because her husband died early, she was not used to sleeping alone, so she became involved with Ye A'san from Pudong for many years. Later, due to disagreements, she refused to associate with him, which made Ye very suspicious. He then discovered that she had found another lover. In August of last year, he carried a flashlight and sneaked into the back room, shining the flashlight inside, allowing him to see that she was indeed sleeping intimately with a certain Ge. He was filled with jealous rage and broke into the room, taking both the man and woman to the district office, where they were ordered to reconcile. After Zhou was released, fearing that Ye would come back to pester her, she closed the teahouse. Recently, she reopened the business at Qiu Xin Bridge outside Xiaonanmen. As she was preparing to choose an auspicious day to open, Ye, who had been unemployed for a long time and was struggling to make a living, learned of the news. Yesterday, at around 7:00 AM, he went to the teahouse to request to manage the business so he could have a place to live. Zhou firmly refused, leading to another conflict. Ye, unable to vent his anger, destroyed the soup pots and other items in the shop. Zhou, not to be outdone, immediately ran out and reported to Sun Shaozhen, a watchman at the 26th post, who arrived and detained Ye, taking him back to the First Section of the First District. After a preliminary hearing by the station chief, Ye was ordered to be detained as a warning.</p>

<p>The Russian-style wine shops, cafes, and Japanese brothels along Qiujiang Road in northern Shanghai are all illegitimate businesses. They harm public morals and hinder municipal development. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has been ordered to order the district offices under its jurisdiction to relocate them within a limited time or change to legitimate businesses. Several of them have complied with the order and closed down, but some Japanese brothels have been delaying. It is reported that Director Yuan has ordered the relevant district offices to order them to relocate and has dispatched inspectors to supervise the implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Arrest of Robbers Who Stole Gravel Boats <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The China-France Stone Company, located in Tonghe Lane on Maigen Road, sent partners to Changzhou to purchase seven boats of gravel for transport to Shanghai.

The company reported this to the relevant police district and the First Water Police District in Minhang, requesting a strict investigation. It is now learned that the case has been investigated by Zhang Quanzhou and Ren Xiangyun, detectives of the First Water Police District, who obtained clues and arrested Cao Jiagui, a key suspect in the case, at Beixinjing at 7:00 AM on the 19th.

<h3 id="e163">The Thief Shi Yuting Has Committed Many Crimes <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Public Security Bureau previously dispatched detective Gu, along with the Huishi police, to arrest the notorious thief Shi Yuting and his concubine Jin Shen, and delivered them to the Special District Court, requesting a transfer of the case. This has been briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, detective Gu has discovered that the thief has committed numerous crimes. According to reliable evidence, in 1927, he robbed property in the Public Concession of this city. After the crime, detective Bai Chongqi arrested him at the Daguan Garden on Erma Road. However, the thief was cunning and pretended to be a nobleman from Ningbo, and was released after being deceived, escaping to Chongming. In less than two months in Chongming, he gathered accomplices and robbed a family in a village in Chongming, and was arrested by the Chongming County and sentenced to one year and six months in prison. After his release, he returned to Shanghai. In the French Concession, he gathered a crowd to rob hundreds of boxes of red pills. After the crime, he was arrested and sentenced by the French court to six months in the Western Prison. He has been out for only a few months and has committed several robbery cases in the French Concession. The French Concession detective Jin Jiuxiang verified the facts and issued an arrest warrant. However, the thief, fearing strict arrest, hid in Qipu Road in the British Concession. In April of this year, he gathered accomplices and robbed the family of Huang Zhiting, a farmer in Chenjia浜, Sanlintang. As a result, arrest warrants for the strict arrest of the suspect were issued everywhere. Today, the net of justice is wide, and he was finally captured.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Luggage of a Guangdong Woman Robbed <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Involving a Movie Actor</p>
<p>Some of Which is Untrue and Incomplete</p>
<p>Yang Baozhen, a woman from Guangdong, filed a complaint with the First Section of the Fifth District, stating that she lived at No. 28 Houde Lane, North Sichuan Road. Because she wanted to visit her sister in Hangzhou, she learned that her friend Yu Xia lived in the Yuegong Hotel, so she brought her suitcase and luggage to Yu's place, asking her to accompany her to Hangzhou. However, she did not meet Yu. In Room 3, she met Lu Lele, a movie actor. She intended to ask him to accompany her to Hangzhou, but Lu colluded with Yu Zongxian, a Cantonese, pretending to be a detective, and tried to extort $70 without success, and took her luggage away. Therefore, she went to Yu Xia's place to borrow money to redeem her belongings. Yu, feeling unjust, accompanied her to file the complaint. Yu Xia testified that she worked at the Lehua Film Company. Yang Baozhen came to her place to borrow money. She inquired about the situation and accompanied her to file the complaint. The police station immediately dispatched police officers. In the evening, Yu Zongxian was arrested at the front desk and confessed that he lived in Derui Lane on Haining Road and was the head of documents at a certain lawyer's office. He went to the Yuegong Hotel to discuss Zheng's case with the parties involved and saw Lu Lele and the plaintiff arguing in the neighboring room, talking about room fees, etc. Then, the plaintiff took out $3, which Lu took. The plaintiff told him that she had a suitcase and luggage but had no place to store them, so she asked him to keep them at his house, not wanting to leave them with Lu Lele, whom she saw as a con artist. Unexpectedly, now she says he embezzled her luggage and wants him to pay her $300 to settle the matter, which is completely an act. Because the case was disjointed and the content was problematic, the police station transferred it to the District Court for investigation yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Yesterday's Car Accident Resulted in Death <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Three Cases in One Day</p>
<p>Totaling Two Deaths and One Injury</p>
<p>Zhu Hongliang Died: Zhu Hongliang, a native of Suzhou, was 20 years old. He was an apprentice at Yichengxiang Glasses in Xinbeimenkou. Yesterday afternoon, he was invited by a friend to Bansongyuan in the South City. At that time, a rental car with license plate number 7554 from the Concession was speeding from north to south. Zhu was unable to avoid it in time and was run over, suffering a head injury and bleeding profusely. A police officer from the Second Section of the First District Public Security Bureau witnessed this and detained the car. The injured person was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment but died at 5:30 PM due to the severity of his injuries.</p>
<p>Luo Baoyuan Died: Luo Baoyuan, a native of Yong, was 58 years old and worked as a doorman at Xiangtai Timber Company. Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, while walking along Manzhou Road, he was suddenly hit by a cargo truck with license plate number 16553. He suffered severe injuries to his head and left arm and lost consciousness. Afterwards, a police officer arrived and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, his injuries were too severe, and he died shortly after being admitted.</p>
<p>Yuan Zhicheng Injured: Yuan Zhicheng, a 17-year-old youth, worked as an accountant and bill collector at Quandeli Rice Store at No. 190 Baini Mengmalang Road in the French Concession. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, he was riding his bicycle to Yulin Road in Tilangi to collect bills. After finishing his business, he detoured to Pei Kai'er Road. The road was being repaired, so he was traveling slowly, following a cargo truck with license plate number 9370. Unexpectedly, another car of some number sped up and knocked Yuan to the ground, causing a head injury and profuse bleeding. A police officer with number 185 saw this and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Smuggling Soldiers Sell Smuggled Salt <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Knowingly Commit the Crime, Sentenced to Six Months in Prison</p>
<p>Chen Deguang, a soldier of the current rank in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces' Anti-Smuggling Team, from northern Jiangsu, would hide the smuggled salt he seized without reporting it to the authorities and sell it privately. This kind of private profit-seeking behavior is more harmful than that of smugglers because it allows smuggled salt to flood the market, causing official sales to decline. At 2:00 PM on Friday, the 5th, Chen carried a load of smuggled salt, weighing 130 catties, produced in Pudong, and sold it in the Yangshupu area. While passing Linqing Road, he was spotted by a Chinese police officer from the 218th Third Pier. Because the salt bags were black and light and did not have the whiteness of official salt, he questioned him. Chen's answer was evasive. The police officer arrested the man and the salt and notified the Gongmao Salt Shop to send someone to the police station to confirm that it was indeed smuggled salt. The next morning, he was sent to the Special District Court. Jiang Baoli, a lawyer from the salt shop, argued in court that the defendant was a soldier in the Anti-Smuggling Team who sold smuggled salt, knowingly committing the crime, and should be severely punished. According to Chen, the salt was transported from Yuyao. After questioning, Judge Ge sentenced Chen Deguang to six months in prison and confiscated the smuggled salt.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Investigation of Suspects in a Theft Case <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Yangshupu police successively arrested suspects in a theft case, including Xu Xiaoniu, Zhang Yuzhu, Mao Jiake, Long Xishan, and the woman Zhang Zhang. They found a pistol and four bullets. The day before, they were transferred to the Special District Court for trial. According to reports from Chinese and Western detectives, Xu and others were arrested at No. 1010 Yangshupu Road and Qiwupu Road in Yangzhou Road. The guns and bullets were found at the bottom of the staircase in Zhang Yuzhu's residence on Yangshupu Road. However, the case still needs to be investigated, and a postponement is requested. Judge Ge then questioned the defendant Xu Xiaoniu, who confessed that he had twice gathered a gang to rob shops and property this month, and the stolen goods were distributed at Zhang's house. However, the amount stolen was very small, only seven yuan and four jiao, two Xiangyun gauze trousers, two towels, and three bars of soap. After pawning the items, he received three yuan and four jiao, Mao Jiake and Long Xishan each received one yuan. When going to rob, Zhang provided the pistol, and the gun was returned to Zhang after the robbery and has now been confiscated. Zhang Yuzhu confessed that the pistol was brought by Xu Xiaoniu, wrapped in paper, and asked his wife Zhang Zhang to hide it. As soon as it was placed, detectives came to search. Xu's confession is purely slanderous. Zhang Zhang's statement was similar to that of her husband, except that she said that when Xu brought the gun, her husband was not at home. Xu said that he wanted to visit her husband and went with her to the vegetable market to look for him. They met on the way home and were arrested. Mao and Long did not know each other. This time, they were framed by those people. Mao and Long also denied being bandits, saying that they had a feud with Xu and were being falsely accused. Judge Ge ordered the defendants to be detained separately pending further investigation.</p>

<p>A Robbery of Marriage... or a Kidnapping?</p>
<p>Cao Sanmei, daughter of Cao Fuxiang, a native of Yancheng residing at No. 222 Tanzhiwan, Zhabei, is only sixteen years old. She was betrothed to Ma Wensheng, the younger brother of Ma Wenlin from the same village (however, Cao claimed that there was no marriage contract with the Ma family). Yesterday, when Sanmei was returning home from work, she was suddenly intercepted and hijacked by Ma Wenlin and others, including Liu Jinliang, Zhang Xihua, and Peng Yubin. However, Cao had a young son who happened to be going to Tokyo Road to pawn something. Seeing his older sister being hijacked, he cried and returned home. Cao Fuxiang filed a complaint with the Fourth District Police Station, stating that Ma Wenlin was a well-known braggart. His daughter was only sixteen years old, while his younger brother was twenty-nine years old. There was no marriage to speak of. He claimed it was a robbery of marriage, but in reality, it was a kidnapping. The station immediately dispatched detectives to arrest Ma Wenlin, Liu Jinliang, Zhang Xihua, Peng Yubin, and others. However, they could not find Ma Wensheng and Cao Sanmei. They were escorted to the station and, as the case involved robbery and abduction, they were ordered to be transferred to the District Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e169">The Tragic Farce of Misunderstanding and Insulting a 'B瘪三' (Good-For-Nothing) <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Zhixian, a 27-year-old partner at Zhonghe Rice Shop at No. 197 Lime Kiln, Xiaoshadu, West Shanghai, was a native of Baoying. At around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, he was playing outside the door after work. Yao Jifu, a well-known person who lived nearby at No. 167, came to talk. Zhang held Yao's hand and told him that a 'b瘪三' had come to the shop to steal just now, but he caught him, and because he had not stolen anything, he released him. In fact, this had happened. Yao mistakenly thought that Zhang was calling him a 'b瘪三' and harbored resentment. He left immediately. In a short time, Yao invited Zhou Fusheng, armed with sharp knives, to come back to confront Zhang. After a disagreement, they knocked Zhang to the ground and stabbed him three times in the thighs, kicking and punching him, causing a bloody mess. Police officers arrived and forcefully detained the two assailants, Yao and Zhou, but the knives had been discarded and could not be found. They were taken back to the Sixth District Police Station along with the injured person. Director Ren immediately dispatched police officers to take Zhang Zhixian to the hospital for treatment. Yao Jifu confessed that he was 28 years old, a native of Baoying, and lived at No. 167 Lime Kiln. He worked at the Rihua Factory. Zhou Fusheng confessed that he was 26 years old, a native of Baoying, and lived at No. 70 Lime Kiln. He worked at a factory. After obtaining the confession, Director Ren believed that the case involved assault and battery and sent a document yesterday to the court for investigation.</p>

<p>Zhang Lianying, daughter of Zhang Chen, a woman residing at No. 36 Pi Shao Nai Road in the French Concession, is 23 years old this year. Last year, she fell in love with Wu A'gen. Suddenly, in April of this year, she left her mother and eloped with Wu, hiding in the Jiangwan area. Her mother reported the incident to the police, requesting an arrest. A detective learned of the situation and went with the local police to arrest Wu and Zhang and take them back to the French police station. The day before yesterday, they were sent to the French Court for investigation. First, Zhang Chen filed a complaint about the situation. Wu A'gen confessed that he had been involved with Zhang Lianying for a long time. This time, Zhang Lianying voluntarily went with him to live in his hometown of Jiangwan, and he did not abduct her. Zhang Lianying's testimony was the same. The Chinese and Western officials sentenced Wu A'gen and Zhang Lianying each to two months in prison, suspended for three years.</p>

<p>Wang Wanhe and Wang Wanyin, natives of Jiancheng, had a verbal argument with a woman surnamed Liu from the same village on Guangxin Road. Wang Wanhe slapped her in the face, knocking her to the ground, and Wang Wanyin stabbed her hands and legs with a knife. Fortunately, the injuries were minor, and she recovered the next day. The two Wangs fled at the time but were later arrested by the police. At first, they denied the assault.

The day before yesterday, they were sent to the French Court for investigation. First, the plaintiffs filed a complaint about the robbery. The two robbers, Ren and Wang, confessed to organizing the robbery with accomplices.

<p>Zhang Weizu, residing at No. 648 Xiafei Road in the French Concession and working as an accountant at Huiyuan Trust Company, filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the French Court the day before yesterday, stating that the businessman was returning home from the company yesterday and took a tram on the Bund. At the intersection of Dama Road, a Russian named Pang Deng and his friend boarded the tram and sat with the businessman. They pretended to read the newspaper, covering his face. He then felt someone probing his pocket. The businessman had five hundred dollars in his pocket. He immediately checked the money and found that one hundred dollars was missing. Pang's friend got off the tram and left. The businessman reported to the police officer on duty and arrested Pang, requesting an investigation. The defendant, Pang Deng, was represented by lawyer Puleimei, who stated that the defendant was in the jewelry business and had a good reputation. He was also taking the tram home that day and was falsely accused of theft by the plaintiff. The accusation was without evidence and requested that it be dismissed and that he be allowed to file a counterclaim for damages to his reputation. Judge Zhu ruled that the plaintiff's accusation was without evidence and should be dismissed.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, which forwarded instructions from the Ministry of Interior, stating that it has recently been found that in various places, villagers still use the dragon flag of the former Qing Dynasty during deity worship gatherings, waving them conspicuously in parades, acting as if they were not doing anything wrong. Although this is due to the ignorance and lack of knowledge of the villagers, it forms a reactionary movement. Under the clear sky and white sun, such imperial dragon flags should not be allowed to exist. The county magistrate was instructed to strictly prohibit the use of dragon flags and destroy them to maintain the system. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Yan yesterday forwarded the order to the County Public Security Bureau, instructing all branch offices to comply and strictly prohibit and destroy dragon flags at any time to maintain the system.</p>

<p>To the esteemed Chief Editor,</p>
<p>Greetings. On May 20th, a dead body was found floating on the East China Sea. The face was no longer clear. The person was approximately fifty years old, had a jade bracelet on his hand, and had nearly twenty yuan in cash in his clothing (this amount has been used). There were also five or six cards bearing the name Chen Shanfu, a native of Nanhai, Guangdong. We previously sent a letter to the Guangdong Guild Hall, but we have now heard that there is no such guild hall in Shanghai, or perhaps the name is slightly different. We respectfully request that your newspaper publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section so that his family can claim the body. This would be a truly virtuous act. With this, I wish you peace.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted by villager Zhu Jinqi on June 17th.</p>
<p>Regarding the news item in your newspaper's local news column, "Mother and Son Dispute Property," which stated that Ningbo native Yu Longzhang recently claimed that after the death of his father, Yu Jinlin, the entire estate was seized by his father's concubine, Yu Cai, etc. (details omitted), we are extremely shocked. According to our client, Yu Cai, she is Yu Jinlin's second wife, and her memorial tablet has already been placed in the Yu clan's ancestral hall and recorded in the genealogy, with conclusive evidence. Furthermore, when Yu Cai married Yu Jinlin in 1915, Yu Longzhang was only five years old and was raised by Yu Cai. From childhood to adulthood and marriage, he always called Yu Cai "Mother." Even in the recent reports, Yu Longzhang claimed to be in mourning at the behest of his late mother, clearly acknowledging Yu Cai as his mother. Unexpectedly, Yu Longzhang falsely accused Yu Cai of being Yu Jinlin's mistress from his early years and not his second wife. Yu Cai has filed a criminal lawsuit with the local court against him for intentionally damaging her reputation, and the case is currently under review. We request that this letter be published. Respectfully submitted by Lawyer Dai Chengxiang on June 22, 1930.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Tang Weizhi Urges Immediate Action to Relieve the Rice Shortage <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Whenever I hear about the suffering of the people in recent times, I feel heartbroken and cannot restrain myself. Today, the rice shortage is an urgent problem. The more expensive rice becomes, the more difficult life becomes for the people. The more difficult life becomes for the people, the more bandits there will be. In recent years, various provinces have experienced famine, and most of the relief has been provided by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. However, in the near future, the counties north of the Yangtze River will likely become like Shaanxi and Gansu. If the essence of southeastern Zhejiang is exhausted, the national economy and the people's livelihood will also be exhausted with it. Moreover, with continuous rain, if we encounter a disaster this year, there will inevitably be starving people everywhere. How can we, the poor people, bear this? Thinking of this, I want to cry but have no tears.</p>
<p>The most urgent measure to address the root cause of the problem is to request that the Shanghai public-spirited merchants and the public-spirited merchants in the interior, as well as the public-spirited rice merchants in various places, jointly organize a Rice Shortage Relief Association. All the public funds accumulated in various counties should be investigated and allocated. Those without cash should be asked to donate as much as possible and purchase indica rice and flour in full quantities. They should be prepared for flat-rate sales and timed circulation until the new rice is harvested. If the above measures cannot be cooperated on for the time being, please ask each county to prepare separately and gradually promote them. All farmers' banks in various places are intended to facilitate farmers. The method is good, and the intention is beautiful. This matter should also imitate the community granary method, purchase rice and grain, and lend it to farmers, who will repay the principal later. This will further benefit the feelings of farmers. As for the rice merchants in various counties, if there are any goods in storage, please show great compassion and sell them quickly so that the market can circulate funds. If more rice is imported in this way, even those in various provinces who are begging for relief can also benefit from the surplus. (Yesterday, I saw a newspaper report about Jiangxi Province begging for relief, and the text was extremely painful.) If the rain does not stop and the new crops are submerged, farmers should be notified immediately to prepare to plant late rice and various grains as appropriate (they should be planted according to the products suitable for the local soil, and the priority should be given to those that are resistant to hunger) to make up for the losses.</p>
<p>The Book of Documents says, "They hold their wives and children in their arms and appeal to Heaven with sorrow." Mencius said, "If people suddenly see a child about to fall into a well, they will all feel alarmed and compassionate." Today, the rice shortage is so severe that many villagers are living on bean dregs and chaff. How can we bear to sit idly by and do nothing? As the saying goes, "It is difficult to buy poverty in times of difficulty with money." We urge benevolent gentlemen to quickly join forces to plan and maintain. At this time, being able to raise a few bushels of rice can extend the lives of several poor people. With tears streaming down my face, I present these words, hoping for your kind consideration.</p>

<p>Declaration of Publication</p>
<p>At the beginning of this month, those involved in the Nationalistic Literary and Art Movement gathered somewhere in this city and issued a declaration, attracting the attention of the literary and art circles. We have obtained the original text of the declaration and publish it below.</p>
<p>The Chinese Nationalist Literary and Art Movement held a meeting in Shanghai on June 1, 1930, and issued the following declaration:</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>China's literary and art circles have recently fallen deeply into a deformed and morbid developmental process. This phenomenon will not be denied by anyone who pays even slight attention to China's art and literary scene today. Today's current situation is precisely the crisis of Chinese literature and art.</p>
<p>If we take a look at our literary and art scene today, we can discover this mixed situation. We will see that in this new literary and artistic era, there are still people who maintain residual feudal thoughts. The history of China's New Literary and Art Movement is not very long. Although its acceptance by the general public cannot be denied, from the time the New Literary and Art Movement occurred until today, because those engaged in the New Literary and Art Movement lacked a central consciousness of literature and art, and focused on formal reforms while neglecting the enrichment of content, all residual feudal thoughts are still invisibly dominating everything. This is undeniable.</p>
<p>At the same time, we see the so-called proletarian literary and art movement that calls itself the left wing. They "present" art "to the bloody struggle of 'victory or death'" and "...art cannot but take as its content the feelings felt by the proletariat in this dark class society of the 'Middle Ages'..." At the same time, we also see the movement of the so-called left-wing painter association. In their declaration, they say, "Gentlemen, please look at those gold-worshipping painters. Apart from their own fame and gold, apart from their own territory and luxurious lives, they have never worked for our benefit... Young artists, you should recognize that their deception and exploitation are their consistent policies of oppression..." Therefore, in our China, the old literature and art have collapsed, but in the process of building new literature and art, this kind of conscious class art movement has emerged.</p>
<p>In such two extremes of thought, we can still see many forms of situations. Each small organization possesses a subjective view. Therefore, today's new literary and art scene in China is filled with fragmented remnants. In such a situation, a central consciousness of literature and art cannot be formed. Therefore, from the time of the New Literary and Art Movement until today, we have achieved very little in new literature and art. If this multi-faceted literary and artistic consciousness develops along its respective perceived path, then this chaotic remnant of literature and art will never disappear. The result will be that our New Literary and Art Movement will never have a chance to develop and will inevitably collapse. The current phenomenon is precisely the crisis of our new literature and art.</p>
<p>But how can we break through this crisis and allow our New Literary and Art Movement to evolve to a bright and glorious realm? First, we believe that the current crisis of Chinese literature and art is due to the multifaceted views on literature and art, and the lack of a central consciousness in the entire developmental process of new literature and art. Therefore, the only way to break through this current crisis is to strive for the formation of a central consciousness in the evolutionary process of new literature and art.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Art, from its earliest historical records, has clearly shown us the mission it bears. We understand very clearly that works of art in their original state are not produced from individual consciousness but from the consciousness of life formed from the standpoint of the nation. What is displayed in a work of art is not only the artist's talent, technique, style, and form. At the same time, what is displayed in a work of art is also the product of the nation to which the artist belongs. This is very clearly told to us in the name of art.</p>
<p>From the distant ancient art, we can see the national foundation of art. The reason why pyramids and human-faced beasts were discovered in Egypt is because this art is a manifestation of the Egyptian national spirit. What they display is precisely the Egyptian national consciousness. The pyramid is a tomb building. Its rise is sufficient to reflect the religious beliefs of Egyptians regarding the concept of the dead. Human-faced beasts and other art forms are all expressions of Egyptian national religion. The great buildings and sculptures left by Greece are also expressions of the Greek national character. Because the Greek nation has a brave and lively spirit, a beautiful and strong body, excited and enthusiastic emotions, a demand for material enjoyment, a this-worldly thought rather than a transcendent religious view of life, and an interest in sports, what is expressed in Greek art is precisely the Greek national spirit. The Venus statue, which is most easily seen by the general public, is enough to reflect the Greek nation's religious concept symbolizing life. The more common discus thrower also clearly shows the spirit of the Greeks' love of sports. In Greek art, we see the full expression of the Greek nation. Even in the Middle Ages, in that politically unstable, medieval century filled with local feudalism and lacking national consciousness, the architecture, sculpture, and painting that were popular at the time each had its national color to some extent.</p>
<p>The national color of art became increasingly obvious. When the feudal system of the Middle Ages gradually collapsed, national consciousness grew more and more. The enthusiastic movement of the Renaissance, which opened the way for modern art, was its creation of national art from the constraints of medieval Gothic art. Because of it, we see that the Renaissance and the Baroque and Rococo art that followed are all manifestations of emerging national consciousness.</p>
<p>In literature, the national element of literature exists in the same way as art. Although we cannot now determine its original form, we can be deeply convinced that it must be based on the general consciousness of the nation. This can be clearly understood in the Iliad and Odyssey of Greece, the Nibelungenlied of Germany, the Beowulf of England, the Song of Roland of France, and the Book of Songs, Airs of the States in our country. In the West, the development of national literature must rely on the destruction of the dominance of Latin and the use of national languages. The reason why the Renaissance opened the way for modern literature is that Dante and Chaucer each worked hard to use the national language of their respective nations as a means of their literary expression. In England, due to Chaucer's efforts, we see the brilliant literary era of the Elizabethan era and later.</p>
<p>From these art records, we can understand the origin of literature and art 丨丨 that is, the highest mission of art is to express the national spirit and consciousness to which it belongs. In other words, the highest meaning of literature and art is nationalism.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The full development of nationalistic literature and art, on the one hand, depends on the establishment of national consciousness in politics, and on the other hand, directly affects the establishment of nationalism in politics.</p>
<p>Regarding the former, the full development of national literature and art must await the establishment of a national state in politics. The development of national literature and art must be accompanied by the emergence of a national state. Therefore, in modern times, we see the full development of national literature and art.</p>
<p>Since the Congress of Vienna in 1815, all parts of Europe have been filled with nationalistic ideas. At that time, there were no independent national states of Germany, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Finland on the map of Europe. Therefore, at that time, the nationalistic movement was very turbulent. The purpose of nationalism was to form independent national states. Hungary was under the iron heel of the Habsburgs, and Germany was full of the remnants of the feudal system. Under the same nation, there were many small feudal princes. "Italy is only a geographical term." The Hungarian nationalist movement of people like Szechinye was finally conquered by the Habsburgs. The Habsburg Empire was the hegemon of the European political situation at that time. Under its rule, there were many feudal princes left by the Holy Roman Empire and many political organizations of the so-called Italy. Under this situation, Prussia and Sardinia were the most active in striving for nationalism. We do not need to repeat here how they struggled. At least since the Congress of Vienna, the European nations have recognized that their only way out is nationalism. They began to run in this direction. This road is not a broad road, of course, it is exceptionally rugged.</p>
<p>1871 is a very memorable year. In that year, not only was France defeated miserably by Germany, but it is also memorable because of the success of the European nationalist movement. Since 1815, Germany has recognized this road of nationalism. Because there were too many small princes, Prussia had to be pushed out to be the leader of their nationalist movement. The result was the establishment of the German national state.</p>
<p>1871 is also worth commemorating for the emergence of the Italian nation. Although Italy already had a national state before this year, Rome was still under French occupation. The result of the Franco-Prussian War was the recall of the French troops in the occupation of Rome, allowing the national Italian state to establish its capital in Rome丨Italy's inevitable capital.</p>
<p>Since 1871, although the Germans and Italians have realized their national movements, the European national movement has not stopped because of this. The Balkan issue, from the Berlin Conference to the present, has never been resolved satisfactorily by all parties, and the reason for the brewing of war is the national movement there. At the same time, the Slavic nations subjugated under the Habsburgs began their political national movement after 1871. It was not until the European War after 1914丨1918 that their attempt was realized. As a result of the European War, we saw the emergence of more national states and the collapse of the two major empires. The Slavic nations under the iron heel of the Habsburgs realized their hopes. We saw the establishment of national states such as Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>As a result of the Russian Revolution in November 1917, we not only saw the collapse of Romanov imperialism, but also saw more successes of nationalism at the same time. Not only have nations such as Finland, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia all broken free from the shackles of Russia and established independent national states, but we have also seen the Ukrainian, Belarusian, South Caucasian, Turkic, and Uzbek nations all establish autonomous national states. Even the Russian Socialist Soviet Federal Republic is composed of eleven autonomous states and twelve autonomous regions. This shows that the power of nationalism is enduring and great.</p>
<p>Recently, the National Revolution of China, the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, the free movement of Ireland, the independence movement of the Philippines, and the independence movements of Korea, India, and Vietnam are even more filled with records of the national movement. Therefore, modern literature and art are also filled with the nationalistic movement. Just as the way out in politics is nationalism, the way out for the development of literature and art is also concentrated on nationalism.</p>
<p>The first mover of modern French art was Cézanne. He combined the propositions of various schools of art popular in France at the time, such as the Impressionist focus on the phenomenon of light, Ingres' theory of the universe in painting, and Courbet's realism, and added his own original propositions 丨 the so-called self-expression and emphasis on the form of lines, evolving into the so-called later Cubism and Fauvism, and finally evolving into the so-called "Purism". In this diverse art world, the central consciousness is still one: the French national consciousness.</p>
<p>In Germany, the Germans have their own national art. Their movement is concentrated under the banner of Expressionism. The so-called Expressionism is the expression of the German national spirit and national consciousness. Therefore, Expressionism is particularly rich in strong national characteristics. As Professor Brinton said, "German modern art is the so-called Expressionism, full of German national characteristics."</p>
<p>In addition, the Italians' efforts in national art are concentrated on Futurism, and the Russians' efforts in national art are concentrated on Primitivism. These -isms are all expressions of their national spirit and national consciousness. As mentioned earlier, we can understand very well that the progress of literature and art follows the progress of politics. Therefore, the establishment of national literature and art must await the establishment of a national state.</p>
<p>Regarding the latter, the national movement in literature and art directly affects the establishment of nationalism in politics. This is very clear in the development of Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav national art movement preceded the birth of the Yugoslav nation-state. The Yugoslav Artists' Association, established in 1905 by Mestnovic, was the beginning of the concrete organizational activities of Yugoslav national art. They focused their expression on the historical storms and the national will of the South Slavic nation. Due to the establishment of Yugoslav national art, we saw the emergence of the Yugoslav nation-state after the European War.</p>
<p>Therefore, art and literature must be based on the nation. This fact cannot be denied. But what is the content contained in nationalistic literature and art?</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>A nation is a group of races. The formation of this group of races is determined by common cultural, historical, physical, and psychological points. The common struggle of the past is the only prerequisite for the formation of a nation. The continuous common struggle is the only prerequisite for the survival and evolution of a nation. Therefore, the purpose of nationalism is not only passively to maintain the survival of that group of races, but also to actively exert the strength of that group of people and increase the glory of that group of people.</p>
<p>Art and literature belong to a certain nation, are for a certain nation, and are produced by a certain nation. Their purpose is not only to express the folk thoughts, folk religions, and national sentiments of the nation to which they belong, but also to eliminate all thoughts that hinder national progress, to promote the will of national upward development, and to express the history of all struggles in the process of the nation increasing its own glory. Therefore, nationalistic literature and art not only express the already formed national consciousness, but also create the new life of the nation.</p>
<p>Belonging to the primary national art, expressing national sentiments, we see modern German Expressionism, Russian Primitivism, and French Purism.</p>
<p>Belonging to the secondary national art, we see Italian Futurism and Yugoslav modern art. The central consciousness of Futurism lies in the praise of material or mechanical civilization. We see that Italy is a country lagging behind in material civilization in the West. Precisely because of this, Futurism appeared in Italy to create the Italian nation's awareness of material civilization. Yugoslav national art, under the leadership of Ivan Mestrovic, not only expresses the past struggles of their nation, but also strives to establish the national consciousness of the people of the South Slavic nation.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>The current crisis in our Chinese literary and art scene is the lack of a central consciousness of literature and art. Then, if we want to break through this crisis and promote the development of our literature and art, we must form a central consciousness of literature and art. From the lessons of history, we must concentrate our future efforts on the creation of nationalistic literature and art. Our future literary and artistic activities should be centered on awakening our national consciousness. At the same time, in order to promote the prosperity of our nation, we must promote the will of the nation to develop upward and create a new life for the nation. What we are now bearing is the important and great mission of establishing our nationalistic literature and art.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Sending Students to France by the College of Law and Politics <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>This good news has already been widely reported in the education news columns of the major newspapers in this city on June 18th. Now, for the sake of having a basis for this article, I will transcribe the news report as follows:</p>
<p>"The Shanghai College of Law and Politics (formerly Shanghai University of Law and Politics) on Jin Shenfu Road, Shanghai, since being managed by Dr. Zheng Yuxiu and Dr. Zhu Foding, has been striving to plan and develop, and is developing day by day. Recently, it has been approved and registered by the Ministry of Education of the National Government. Now, in order to cultivate talents, the school has selected five outstanding graduates from this year's graduating class to study in France, including three female students and two male students. It is planned to increase the number to ten or fifteen in the next session," which is not wrong. This is not an exaggerated publicity stunt by the College of Law and Politics. The fact is indeed so. We are so happy that the registration issue, which is of great importance to the future, has finally been approved by the Ministry of Education as a result of the efforts of Dr. Zheng and Dr. Zhu. Not only has the school been registered, but the students seem to have gained a bright future, and the authorities are also sending students to France to study, which especially gives the students special hope. However, according to the news that has been circulating, the five people sent to France this time do not need to go through the examination and selection process, but have already been decided internally by the authorities. Therefore, the students are discussing it one after another. Some say that of the 200 graduates of the College of Law and Politics this year, female students only account for two-tenths, but of those sent to France, two are male and three are female. It is not that the school authorities value women over men, but that the female students' grades are particularly superior to the male students'. Therefore, it has increased the ambition of the female students and extinguished the prestige of the male students. Some say that sending students to study abroad without organizing an examination committee to solemnly select true talents may lead to the abuse of planting private parties and violate the purpose of cultivating talents. Therefore, they cannot help but have doubts about this issue.</p>
<p>Moreover, the fact is like this. According to people who know the inside story, the three ladies sent to France this time are Zhang Shizhu and Zhang Cuiwu. Therefore, there are more discussions among the students. Some say that both Ms. Zhang and Ms. Zhang graduated from the specialized department of the law department this year. In terms of qualifications and knowledge, can it be that the forty or fifty undergraduates are not as good as them? Some say that whether their grades are excellent or not is not to be discussed for the time being, but because they have entered the specialized department, they do not study foreign languages according to the regulations, so they do not understand French. The school authorities do not send undergraduates who have studied French for four years according to the regulations, but prefer to send Ms. Zhang and Ms. Zhang who do not understand French, which seems to be making fun of them.</p>
<p>The above discussions from all sides seem to be reasonable, but they are still the views of scholars and do not fit the current situation. I think the students should not be so forgetful. In the spring of this year, a movement to expel the president occurred at the school. The situation was precarious and could not last. Fortunately, Ms. Zhang Shizhu served as the interim chairman of the students' general assembly, and Ms. Zhang Cuiwu served as the record of the general assembly. In this way, the students' forces stood against each other, and the few elements who controlled the student union were softened, and the movement to expel the president was able to pass safely. If there had been no efforts from Ms. Zhang and Ms. Zhang at that time, I am afraid that the College of Law and Politics would have long been unrecognizable, and there would be no success in registration and celebration of peace today. According to the merits and rewards, Ms. Zhang and Ms. Zhang's being sent to study abroad is well deserved. Moreover, aren't Ms. Zhang and Ms. Zhang reciting French every day, morning and night, with "A, Pan, Shuai, Tai"? (Sword)</p>
