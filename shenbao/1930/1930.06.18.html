<h3 id="c97">四次比賽情形 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>第一次對日本上塲者爲唐寶堃姚恩漢劉建常李國琛王錫良開賽後日隊一躍而得六分由此中　華隊遂現混亂之象有招架而無還擊之能直至最後十分鐘時魏蓬雲加入姚恩漢退出全隊仍無起色至最後三分鐘時敎練以余代王錫良此時吾隊已負十七分（原不必更換球員）作戰後余適逢良機由籃下投入一球銀笛方鳴槍聲遂之而起中華遂以十五分之差敗於日本（遠東新紀錄）是役也我隊劉姚二鋒未見出色各球員動作甚爲遲笨日隊則勇敢非凡二前鋒得有三十分之多一出一進無怪我隊吃一敗仗</p>
<p>第二次戰菲列濱陣線爲唐寶堃姚恩漢劉建常李國琛與余我隊較第一次比賽已進步多多惜唐被人無得者竟三分罰球監住無得分機會苟唐能奏其所長則我隊勝利可卜</p>
<p>第三次又逢日本開始比賽者爲唐寶堃魏逢雲劉建常李國琛與余依敎練之命用個人防衛法ＭantomanDefence惜平時素無此種練習於是反不成體統不十分鐘王錫良代余上半時告終我軍已失有十分之多下半時另易五人余復加入另有陳臣魁姚恩漢王玉增劉冠軍四人開賽後我軍極告奮勇陳姚王各中一球日隊遂要求定戰續戰後日軍命中二球於是我隊要求定戰不知正在商議戰策之際敎練忽更換全班人馬此時距終賽尚餘十分鐘大有反身之望豈知人後竟一蹶不振又以十七分之差二敗於日人痛哉</p>
<p>第四次與菲作第二次之比寶上塲者爲唐寶堃陳盛魁王玉增劉冠軍與余銀角一嗚雙方開始接觸我軍奮不顧身與菲死戰分數板上高懸十與二之比我軍佔先至比數二十與九之時李國琛代余姚恩漢代陳劉建常代王上半時我軍以三十與十五之比佔先下半時開賽後菲隊忽顯其絶技大施攻擊分數漸漸追上至尚存五分時余再入塲而劉冠軍即告退我隊軍勢又見起色李劉與余各中一球歡呼聲起我隊表演極形精彩與菲相持不相上下豈知禍從天來倖忽因四次犯規而被取消資格劉又進塲人後我隊軍心忽而大亂匪隊遂大施其威反擊不止結果我軍以四分之差又敗於菲列濱造成四戰四北之戰續</p>
<h3 id="c98">概論 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>此次敗北之因實非技術之不良只因缺乏應有之籃球智識而受挫然而除余所提及者之外尚有一二點可令人注意</p>
<p>（一）此次籃球隊員之遵守紀律實非他隊所能及除赴會外各人皆終日於宿舍内休息絶不越雷池一步於是各球員對於比賽竟早思夜想將視籃球一項勝如已命致上塲比賽得球後便有不知所措之慨</p>
<p>（二）每次比賽無一人指揮全隊之動作而爲全隊之主將（與本屆足球犯同一之病）以致一人慌忙全隊皆亂演成不可收拾之慘劇</p>
<h3 id="c99">公證人究竟如何 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>對於公證人各報又有極詳細之評論然以余之眼光看來此次之公證人對於執行裁判一事絶對無一點經騐對於規則亦不明晰余尚憶於第一次上塲時與之論及新規則（如跳球與罰球之規定等）約有二分鐘之久彼竟一無所答於是證人處罰之不得當而引起觀衆不平之表示當然公證人與比賽原有密切之關係然以此次之成績而論我隊之敗不可完全歸罪於公證人我軍能將原有之本能沉靜之態度以敵日菲余可斷言勝利一事定可操左劵試觀菲之敗日公證人亦何尚不若是之不合度而菲軍能始終保持其鎭定態度出奇制勝以智敵勇而獲錦標總之三隊實力以歴次之標準比寶而論是當以菲爲最佳中華最劣然以余之眼光看來設我軍能各顯其素有之長鎭定應戰錦標二字非我莫屬</p>
<p>善哉已往之事可不再提下届大會尚有四年之準備余其望國人之勢心體育者能以公正之態度不遺餘力時時加以提倡與鼓勵人人皆有拔劍而起挺身而鬭之氣慨於下屆大會中一雪本届之恥俟日後有暇當再與讀者討論至於如何提倡如何鼓勵余本於未出發前曾想以此次練習之經過與奪得錦標之種種可能與不可能刋諸報上但因恐發生誤會故未敢一試</p>

<p>朱旣醒被逮經過　日下午二時四十分狄思威路捕房華探張桂生接得線人報告謂朱現匿跡西華德路祥安里一千二百八十一號門牌樓上亭子間内張探遂會同西探携帶通緝單前往拘拿時朱正臥床上探等察閱與通緝單上之面貌無異遂將逮捕帶回捕房因此案係總巡捕房調查者轉送該捕房收押</p>
<p>捕房控其犯兩罪昨晨九時由華探費克倫將朱解至特院第一刑庭由刑庭長許家栻君與首席檢察官周先覺升座提訊據捕房代表律師甘鏡先起稱捕房現根據刑律三五七條侵佔罪二二四條僞造文書罪起訴</p>
<p>更改數目之方法緣朱將他人存入之欵史改數目其方法係將保豐錢莊存入銀二萬元於收條改作二千持至西人處簽字再將洋文２０００元後多加一○則仍變爲二萬元付諸錢莊夥友而已則將一萬八千元侵佔三萬元者則改爲三千元總計該項存欵收條被改者現有八紙之多惟未逃之前各錢莊前來兌欵則朱設法將欵如數付還但未還者銀行祇得照付受虧甚鉅今日有利銀行亦有代表到案請訊</p>
<p>有利代表之陳述而朱旣醒之代理律師蔣保釐起稱本案敝律師與江一平律師共同代表被告昨日據捕房言此案須與謝桐候案併訊今日必須改期以故敝律師等對當事人尚未接見以故請爲改期許庭長以對於僞造文書一點須略加訊問遂傳有利銀行代表赫司脫至案陳述改票情形大致與甘律師相同並稱被告所僞造莊票共有三十九紙之多計其數爲十六萬一千七百十三兩七錢九分遂將該項莊票呈案</p>
<p>朱旣醒供辭紀錄許庭長察閱一過即將各莊票日期數目逐一讀出朱頻頻點首稱並無錯誤並供稱伊在有利已十五年初爲副跑街旋升正再升充現職伊之侵佔鉅欵實因糖行虧蝕及任保人賠累鉅欵所致去年伊曾用空欵達達廿五六萬本年五月廿號我曾付銀行中銀三萬七千兩洋一萬元廿一號又交銀四千兩洋四千元我濳逸後本擬於十日内清償不料爲各報將事刋載致信用完全喪失周轉無能至改收條係用商務印書館所售一種藥水云云</p>
<p>正買辦到庭陳述又據有利銀行正買辦凌鵬基投稱當時朱旣醒交銀行中一萬元我曾看見其餘則不知悉許庭長核供遂諭本案改期與謝案併訊朱旣醒還押</p>
<p>僞莊票案之經過繼訊與朱案有連帶關係之鄭和康行使僞莊票案鄭本朱旣醒所開德記糖行之夥友上月廿一號朱旣醒及其兄旣梅囑鄭將益豐錢莊五萬二千一百十六兩七錢六分之莊票一紙至四明銀行存行不料爲該行察覺該票係僞造者遂報告總巡捕房飭探目周孝治將鄭扣留解送特區法院鄭延范剛律師代辯以被告係受主人之命實不知爲僞票庭諭改期再訊鄭交三百元保各情已誌本報</p>
<p>鄭和康准予開釋昨晨許庭長向鄭詰問據供朱旣醒交彼者許君遂令朱旣醒站入證箱朱一口承認范剛律師即起稱今朱旣醒已供認則可以證明被告鄭和康實不知情故請求開釋而捕房甘鏡先律師亦稱被告旣不知情請爲釋放捕房當對朱旣醒另行起訴云云許庭長遂宣告無罪保狀取銷</p>

<p>看了辛酉劇社「關於難劇運動的來函」使我更認識了辛酉劇社的努力和本身的一切他們的「舉行難劇運動底動機」「預定底劇目」「運動期中底種種困難」「運動底結果」」我們的以後」都全部忠實的摯誠的昭示給我們了尤其使我同情的他們在這次難劇運動期中不幸而發生的種種困難而因着困難所追跡來的其他問題更是必然的結果但也因此愈使外界明晰他們在新藝術戲助運動中奮門的精神與毅力這次運動底結果他們自已對於自已是「我們自已却都很抱憾各人的臉上都有頗不自滿的神色因爲缺點是只有自已最清楚的我們都没有做到我們的理想」是的桃花源中桃仙的話猶縈繞在我耳邊「高還有更高的好還有更好的一切的事都無止境的即使我們盡畢生的精力亦是幹不了的」那末努力吧正如袁牧之先生所早告訴了我們的」在拿破崙的字典上没有「難」在我們的字典上也没有「難」我們的字典上只有「幹」努力吧同志們前途不是黑暗」我們願以愛好的熱情來作爲一種棉力的贊助而相鼓勵企圖我們的戲劇運動之進展承辛酉諸先生「我們總像奏姑娘一般含辛茹苦像桃仙一般堅忍不拔不使他失望」見惠這不僅在我有說不出的感謝欣悅凡是愛好的朋友們都會致相當的敬禮現在對於他們的「我們的「我們的以後」略致數語以爲小小的貢獻</p>
<p>的確在這次運動期中觀衆底稀少眞會使我們懷疑起來要嚴格的脫在這民族精神不健全的現代「文舅舅」「狗底跳舞」「桃花源」三劇都是對準下藥的興奮劑它們便眞眞的給與了我們戲劇特質功能的力量所以根據劇本立論辛酉選這三齣戲是有價值的而且在辛酉的演出術和舞台技巧雖然未臻盡善盡美之境但已有相當的成功</p>
<p>袁牧之先生的表演相化裝我敢說他是中國目前唯一的演劇家其他向演員也都有相當的訓練和修養這裏不是我特别恭維袁牧之先生凡是看過他演劇的朋友們都同聲這樣說的那末雖然觀衆是稀少了經濟的窘迫或會使他們到不堪設想的地步可是在十九年的戲劇史上如果編戲劇史的先生不帶着色眼鏡的話那必留下一個光榮的歷史吧所以辛酉底難劇運動在表面是失敗了在實際却大大的成功了何况「失敗是成功之母」那末辛酉底難劇運是應當努力繼續下去的而我們更是熱烈屬望辛酉完成難劇運動的工程由局部而整個地引起社會的信仰觀衆的同情辛酉的戲劇是没有離開了喚醒民族精神這一條路的每齣戲裏都有喚醒民族的寓意他們走的是絶對正當的方向以我的想像民衆對於有價值的戲劇的認識未必就那樣一直淺薄下去要是我們不放鬆宣傳的工作在不久的將來他們一定會有進一步的認識的我們很感傷我們的戲劇界有的是墮入錯誤簡直侮辱戲劇的本來功能祇知當作鬥爭宣傳的武器忘却戲劇藝術的使命有的依然不免於低級趣味的看了這次辛酉的三齣戲深刻的印象使我們感動使我們了解人生的眞諦使我們放開胸懷有胆量地在先明的人生之旅途上大踏步行走總之要喚醒激勵我們的惰性民族性這種宗旨是值得佩服的辛酉社如果變更演劇的方法使觀衆有普遍的了解這層意見當然甚好但是今後選擇劇本要和「文舅舅」「狗底跳舞」「桃花源」一樣注重劇的内容集中在「民族意識」上這是我期望辛酉繼續擔任下去的工程</p>
<p>旣朱穗丞先生有此計劃則可早日施行最後我期待辛酉劇社努力的成績</p>
<p>願辛酉諸先生加以指正</p>
<p>（附通訊）袁牧之先生是我太愛好先生的演劇了眞的當欣賞領會着先生表演的時候我的情緒便隨着奔放我雖没有機會晤先生但我信仰於先生的甚深現在特冒昧要請先生惠賜通信地址俾得趨前領敎這會是奢望吧我期望給我的不是失望請寄申報青年地園編輯部轉可也椿森敬啓</p>

<p>那森嚴而沈寂的門診部裏面只有一位醫生和我並且有一位佈滿了恐慌的情緒的求治者坐在椅子上因爲懂得些少粤語的一位醫生出診去了所以我能夠到門診部去也是爲得着醫生的命令呌我前去暫作翻譯員爲她們雙方面傳達意見</p>
<p>醫生照例的問了姓名年齡住址後就問到旣往症了原來她是個新從鄕中出來的人爲了她的丈夫與好意見不合時常互相齟齬因此决定嘗那離婚的生活不幸她在上海住在朋友家裏兩個月來而知道自已身體上起了變化了又感着食慾不振噁心嘔吐倦怠的種種現象有了這顯然的證明她也更爲這小生命憂慮同時也爲着她自已的前途設想起見就决意想將這小生命犧牲了</p>
<p>但是這是法律上不許的事情我們怎可爲了憐憫她而背了人道主義的信條呢那醫生只是很尊嚴的拒絶那求治者却極端的哀求在這進退兩難的光景我也感着困難了不得已用些慰安的言詞聊作暫時的救濟不料他却用了弱小者的口頭禪說若是辦不到她寗死以滌清她的一切說着眼涙滴下來了終於放聲的抽咽</p>
<p>「不要哭吧據醫生檢查的結果還未能確定你是受孕的因爲在好的回去吧不要把自已急病了倒不濟事過一二月後你再到這裏來檢查我爲你祝福希望上天不至於不至公希望失意者能得意吧」我鼓着勇氣安慰她一番結果她也好好的冋去了我在校門前目送這失意人的歸程而幻想到人生的神秘和崎嶇（碧零）</p>

<h3 id="e3">Unemployment and Precious Metals <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>In today's world, there are two extremely significant crises brewing concerning the livelihood of the people: one is the increasing unemployment, and the other is the rising price of precious metals. Both of these are caused by global trends. The reasons are not singular, nor have they accumulated in a day. Lloyd George, the leader of the British Liberal Party, discussed the issue of unemployment relief, stating that the nation should regard it as the most urgent matter and should mobilize the nation's strength as it did during the Great War to cope with it. I believe that the issue of precious metals relief should also be addressed in the same way as during the Great War, with all countries jointly mobilizing their full strength to deal with it. Otherwise, the consequences will be even more devastating than the European War.</p>
<p>However, the handling of these two issues is different. Although the tide of precious metals is very turbulent at the moment and seems uncontrollable, if it can be treated calmly and without rash action, and if all countries can openly study and plan from all aspects to determine a relief policy, then the temporary disturbances in the market can be calmed down. Handling it well is not without a chance of improvement. As for the unemployment issue, although it seems to be only a domestic matter on the surface, because it is deeply related, has many complexities, and is constrained by financial resources, it is indeed impossible to solve. The British Labour Cabinet has devoted all its efforts to this matter since the beginning of its administration, but to this day, criticisms have arisen and there is no good way to solve it. This also shows that the unemployment issue is more difficult to deal with. In short, these two issues, viewed separately by country, differ in the impact received, economic situation, and labor history, so the ease or difficulty of dealing with them cannot be generalized. If we discuss them together from the perspective of all countries in the world, the trends are very dangerous and are becoming more critical due to mutual influence. It is indeed impossible to distinguish their ease or difficulty. Today, the strife of various countries over armaments is indeed a crisis of peace, but the economic crisis is even greater than the military one. Lloyd George's belief that the full strength used to cope with the European War should be mobilized to deal with it is no exaggeration.</p>

<p>Tianjin Customs Issue</p>

<p>Simonsen and Billet's comments</p>
<p>Beiping: According to the British Consul in Tianjin's report and the Shanghai Chief Tax Commissioner's telegram, Oudendijk, the head of the mission, is worried that various localities will follow suit in the Tianjin Customs takeover issue, turning the customs system into something like the salt tax, which will be detrimental to both China and foreign countries. Oudendijk is now inviting embassies of relevant countries to discuss solutions and exchange views. (Special telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Simonsen still has a portion of the Tianjin Customs case files that he has not received. Simonsen served as an assistant to the Customs Commissioner in the Gengzi year and received great meritorious service. He was transferred back to his country by Hart. This time, as Customs Commissioner, he is already proficient. It is planned that he will be promoted to Chief Tax Commissioner in the future. (Special telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: This afternoon, a Reuters reporter met with Simonsen, who said that yesterday's action was out of necessity, because if the Tianjin Customs was allowed to hand over its income to Nanjing to be used for military expenses, it would be unacceptable. For the past six weeks, the authorities have exhausted all means to have Tianjin Customs reach a reasonable agreement, but all proposals have been rejected with harsh words. Billet, the Tianjin Customs Commissioner, also told the Reuters reporter that everything is now awaiting instructions from the Chief Tax Commissioner. Yesterday's severe actions by the warlords were unexpected, as it was initially believed that negotiations could reach a satisfactory agreement and that customs could be completely free from interference. It should be known that customs is the only solid thread in China's financial organization today. If today's precedent is not corrected, then the only hope for China's financial recovery seems to be completely deteriorated. His views are not from a political point of view, but purely from the standpoint of customs. This issue now depends on the Chief Tax Commissioner's reply regarding the resignation of Tianjin Customs staff. All staff are currently serving normally under Simonsen's management. (Reuters telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Former Postal Commissioner Arnhold is now assisting Simonsen in handling Tianjin customs duties. All staff are temporarily serving as usual and everything is calm. (Special telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese government authorities regard the Yan Xishan's seizure of Tianjin Customs as a major event. They are now studying countermeasures based on telegrams from the Japanese Embassy in Beiping. There are still doubts about Yan's intentions. After careful study, they plan to take a consistent approach with other countries. (Associated Press telegram, 17th)</p>

The pursuit is still underway. (5) The rebel army stationed in Zhengzhou recently levied military coupons worth six million from Zhengzhou shops, causing public resentment and a sluggish market. Various shops are preparing to abandon their businesses. (6) Fan Zhongxiu's coffin was transported back to Zhengzhou on the 7th and stopped at the Tongren Society outside Xiaoximen. Staff in the Zhengzhou office are wearing black纱 armbands. (7) About two divisions of Yan's rebel troops have recently passed through Zhengzhou to the north.

<p>Nanjing: Minister to Germany and Representative to the League of Nations, Jiang Zuobin, telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that the League is discussing an increasing number of issues, and because China is too far from Europe, domestic specialists are unable to attend meetings, which is not a prudent way to conduct diplomacy. To remedy this shortcoming, it is proposed to send four specialists familiar with politics, law, economics, finance, military affairs, society, and opium suppression to be stationed there permanently as specialized committee members. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has forwarded the telegram to the Executive Yuan, stating that the proposal is well-intentioned and can be considered. The ministry also stated that in the past, the embassies of important countries had military attaches for the army and navy, as well as financial and commercial commissioners.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>These positions were abolished due to recent financial constraints, and isolation is unavoidable when something happens. If these positions can be restored at this time, then the relevant commissioners can be selected from them to serve concurrently, otherwise, specialized committee members can be established as proposed by the minister to provide assistance. It is reported that the Executive Yuan has ordered the five ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Industry, Military Affairs, and Navy to deliberate and respond. (Special telegram, 17th)</p>

If you desperately defend Kaifeng and Xuchang, you will eventually perish together. As long as the fathers can correct their mistakes, they will never be held accountable in the past and will be treated equally. Now is the moment of survival, and you must not be deceived by Feng Yuxiang again. (2) To the officers and soldiers of the Jianyuan Army, stating that in the past, you helped the revolutionary army to fight the Northern Warlord Wu Peifu, but now you suddenly help the Northern Warlord Feng Yuxiang to make things difficult for the revolutionary army, which is self-contradictory. Now Fan Zhongxiu has been killed by bombs, Zhang Xueliang has sent troops to suppress the rebellion, and Shi Yousan has also turned against the Jin army. The Jin army in the Beiping and Tianjin area will soon be completely wiped out. If you do not wake up in time, once the army encircles and suppresses you, everything will be destroyed and you will perish together with Feng Yuxiang. Not only will you sacrifice your own lives and the glory of your past history, but you will also be labeled as traitors, which is a pity. (Special telegram, 17th)</p>

The committee also does not favor fixing the value of Hong Kong currency, fearing that it will separate from Chinese silver coinage. The committee intends that if China suddenly adopts the gold standard in the future, Hong Kong should prepare in advance and have experts examine various theories so that a proper plan can be devised to safely convert Hong Kong silver coinage to the gold standard while avoiding difficulties and excessive expenses.

<p>Fighting for Forty Years</p>
<p>Always Optimistic</p>
<p>Large Gathering of Parsees in Bombay</p>
<p>Bomb Explosions in Dhaka</p>
<p>London dispatch. Mr. Schrockombe, the India correspondent for the Daily Herald (Labour Party organ), visited Gandhi at the prison in Pune and asked him if he had considered the dangers of the non-cooperation movement. Gandhi replied that he had, of course, considered them. He also said, "Some people point to my actions as a crazy adventure, but this is a legitimate adventure. The achievement of any great goal is not without danger." Mr. Schrockombe asked if he thought the government would admit defeat in the struggle between those trying to break the salt laws and the government. Gandhi smiled and said, "I am an optimist. I have fought for forty years and have repeatedly been laughed at for being futile, but I have repeatedly proven that this is not the case." Gandhi finally stated that he was prepared to advise the All-India National Congress to suspend the non-cooperation movement and support the Round Table Conference on the following conditions: (1) The draft of a constitution granting India independence in reality must be included in the Round Table Conference's agenda. (2) The demands of the Indian people must be satisfied, and foreign cloth must be banned. (3) Amnesty for political prisoners who support the non-cooperation movement. As for the remaining items in his letter to the Governor-General before the march, namely (1) abolishing the Criminal Investigation Department's sedition conditions and accusations against political prisoners, (2) issuing licenses for weapons for self-defense, (3) passing the laws for coastal reclamation, (4) halving land taxes, military expenditures, and salaries of senior officials, and (5) reducing the rupee exchange rate from one shilling and six pence to one shilling and four pence, will all be discussed later. Mr. Schrockombe stated at the end of his telegram that, in his opinion, "If the British Indian government recognizes Gandhi and the National Congress as negligible political forces, it will suffer. I believe only by cooperating with Gandhi can the Round Table Conference be realized." (World)</p>

<p>Sharp Decline in Exports to China and India</p>
<p>Falling Silk Prices Affect Cocoon Market</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Rengo) - The Japanese domestic cotton industry is encountering unprecedented difficulties and is in a state of extreme operational hardship. China, a major customer in the past, is developing rapidly due to the sharp drop in silver prices and low wages. The number of spindles in yarn factories operated by Chinese and foreigners has increased by 430,000 compared to the previous year, gradually putting great pressure on Japanese domestic yarn factories. Therefore, the dividends of various yarn factories have all decreased this period. The important reason is that imports to China and India have sharply declined. Exports to India in mid-May decreased by 33% compared to March, and exports to China decreased by 44%.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Rengo) - The price of spring cocoons has plummeted due to the fall in silk prices. One "kan" (approximately 3.75 kilograms) is only 4 yuan and 67 jiao, about half of last year's price. The production cost of one "kan" is 6 yuan, 1 jiao, and 3 fen. Silkworm farmers must suffer a loss of 1 yuan and 56 jiao. The national loss is estimated to be over 100 million.</p>

<p>Zhu Qinglan pleads for the Shaanxi people. To Mr. Shi Liangcai of Shen Bao. Qinglan has repeatedly visited Shaanxi Province and personally experienced the severe disaster in various counties, witnessing the tragedy of death. The current population in a village is two-fifths or three-fifths less than before the disaster. The surviving people are mostly starving and dying of illness. Young women are being sold to exhaustion, and houses are being dismantled and sold, leaving only ruins. The sounds of chickens and dogs are not heard all day long, as if walking through a tomb. The area for planting wheat is less than one-tenth of what it should be. Shaanxi Province received rain last winter and this spring, which is truly a glimmer of hope. However, the lack of seeds is too great. We are currently raising funds for distribution, but even if the late autumn crop is not planted, the disaster victims will have no food to eat until the autumn harvest. The North China Charity Federation is currently established in Dabaoji Alley in the provincial capital to oversee the distribution of emergency relief. However, the amount of grain and funds raised in Pingjin and Dong Provinces is limited and is only a drop in the bucket. I deeply worry that it will not be enough. You, sir, are concerned about your fellow citizens and share their pain. The southeast has always had many generous benefactors. I respectfully request that you vigorously promote and widely solicit donations, either by sending personnel to distribute or by remitting funds to our association for joint distribution. Please also publish in the newspapers to encourage more people to rise up and raise more funds to save more lives. I cannot express my expectations enough. Zhu Qinglan.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Case of French Sailors Shooting and Wounding Chinese Police in Hankou <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: A case of French sailors shooting and wounding Chinese police occurred at 9:50 PM on the 14th on Eryao Road in Special District One of this city. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Incident: At 9:50 PM on the night of the 14th, three French sailors had an argument with a rickshaw puller in front of the Bu Na Mao Foreign Firm on Eryao Road because they did not pay the full fare. Police Officer Zhang Guangyu, who was on duty in the area, went to mediate and waved the rickshaw puller away. Unexpectedly, the sailors beat the rickshaw puller. Not satisfied with that, they turned their anger on the police officer and punched him repeatedly. The police officer had no choice but to blow his whistle for assistance. The sailors then took out their pistols and fired three shots in a row, wounding police officers Liu Jinshan and Xia Jinshan. They then fired three more shots, and an American military policeman who was passing by was hit and injured in the limbs. He was admitted to the hospital. Police Officer Liu Jinshan suffered a severe injury to his right ankle bone, and Xia Jinshan was injured in the leg. Both were ordered by the head of the police station to be taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Zhang Guangyu's injuries were relatively minor because he was punched.</p>
<p>Arrest of Suspects: After the gunshots erupted, the area was in an uproar. Nearby shops closed their doors one after another. Chen Shiyong, the head of the police station, immediately telegraphed the Public Security Bureau and personally led a translator and chief police officer to the scene of the incident to investigate. Just then, Captain Jiang of the Public Security Bureau Security Team also led armed police officers to the scene and searched separately. They apprehended a French military officer, Head Keqin, and one sailor, and found a pistol and many bullets. They were immediately taken to the police station for custody. It was already 1:00 AM.</p>
<p>Demands of the French Consul: After the incident occurred, the French Consul, Bodes, personally went to Mayor Liu's residence late at night with Secretary You to negotiate. According to them, Head Keqin was the captain of a ship and was ordered to go to the scene to investigate after hearing that sailors were causing trouble on shore. He was not the perpetrator. They also said that the bullets that wounded the Chinese police were different from Head's bullets, indicating that Head was not the perpetrator. Mayor Liu carefully examined the bullets with Chief Chen and confirmed that the bullets were different, as the French Consul had said. The French Consul was then asked to write a letter of guarantee stating two points: (1) Head Keqin was the captain of a capital warship sent to investigate the case; (2) Head Keqin's bullets were different from the bullets that wounded the Chinese police. Finally, he requested their release. Mayor Liu, believing that the real perpetrator had escaped and that there was no need to detain the suspects for long, telegraphed Chief Chen at 8:00 AM on the 15th to release them and to vigorously pursue the real perpetrator.

<h3 id="e56">Central Army Blockades Bozhou <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Sun Dianying Asks Lu Zhonglin for Relief</p>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: The Central Army's Wang Jun division has been besieging Bozhou for over a month. Sun Dianying had built three strong lines of moats and densely laid obstacles outside Bozhou, which were all broken through by the Central Army. Now, Sun's troops are relying on the defenses within the city to hold out desperately. The Central Army, wishing to completely annihilate Sun's forces but also considering that Bozhou is a prosperous area in northern Anhui, is reluctant to use heavy artillery to bombard it, so it is strictly blockading it to achieve a complete resolution. According to the Yun Ri Bao, Sun's show of sincerity to the Central Government is entirely a tactic to ease our side's vigilance so that he can seize the opportunity to seek aid from the Northwest. The General Headquarters' field headquarters has announced for days that it has intercepted many telegrams from Sun Dianying in Bozhou seeking aid from Feng Yuxiang, Yan Xishan, Lu Zhonglin, and Sun Liangcheng. The following two excerpts can show that he has reached a state of desperation: (1) Sun Dianying's telegram to Lu Zhonglin in Zhengzhou stated: "My troops have been besieged for over a month, and our supplies of food and ammunition have long been exhausted. Since the 20th of last month, I have ordered the troops to seize the new wheat within our defense area to勉資維持 (勉資維持). Now, the new wheat is also depleted, and the enemy's siege is increasingly urgent. Our ammunition is exhausted, so I have ordered our troops to hold with white blades. Bozhou is in imminent danger. Please send a large force to reinforce us quickly and provide us with financial and ammunition assistance." (2) Sun Dianying's telegram to Sun Liangcheng stated: "General Commander Sun, Shao Yun, your distinguished seal. Since troops were drawn to aid Lucheng on the 6th, the enemy's 3rd Army, 7th Division has sent another brigade to besiege Bozhou, attacking fiercely day and night. I led the troops to charge three times but failed to break through. Last night's bloody battle was the fiercest. We have no more bullets for our guns and cannons. Although the officers and soldiers are brave, it is truly difficult to resist the enemy with bare hands. Ammunition transported from Qixian could not be delivered because Bozhou is in heavy encirclement and remains in Zhecheng. Bozhou's crisis is imminent. Even if we wanted to retreat, we cannot fly out of this heavy encirclement. Now the enemy is approaching the West Gate. If we lose it, we can only be slaughtered to repay your kindness. What else is there to say? If I fail in my duties, I earnestly request that you order a strong force to come to our aid day and night; otherwise, we will be waiting to die. My mind and strength are exhausted, and I cannot say all that I wish. Sun Kuiyuan bows respectfully (June 16th)."</p>
<h3 id="e57">Anhui Finance and Education Commissioners Arrive in Wuhu <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Sun Shengwu's Talk on Anhui's Finances</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: Anhui's Finance Commissioner Sun Shengwu recently stated that the province's financial situation has reached a critical point, with resources exhausted and coping becoming extremely difficult. Wuhu, being the financial center of Anhui, has long been considered a place to negotiate loans with the banking community. During his previous trip to Shanghai, he telegraphed the heads of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Wuhu to go to Shanghai for preliminary talks. Now, with the end of the 18th accounting year approaching, all government expenses must be cleared and paid as a conclusion. Due to the urgent need for funds, he arrived in Wuhu yesterday (the 14th) from Anqing on the Anfeng military vessel for further talks. Upon arrival at the port, officials from various agencies welcomed him. He then lodged at the Bank of China. This morning, I paid him a visit and asked about the recent financial situation in Anhui. Mr. Sun's remarks were as follows: "Anhui's finances were originally very difficult, but not as dire as they are now. This is because the northern part of Anhui has suffered from war and banditry this year, resulting in no tax revenue. Although there is tax revenue in southern and central Anhui, the amount is meager and insufficient to cover expenses. The only item with relatively high revenue is salt tax, followed by wheat tax. As for rice levies, there is almost no tax revenue to speak of because there is no rice export, which is a huge loss. When I took office in May, the province's government and temporary expenses owed totaled over 800,000 yuan. After repeated efforts, I managed to allocate 600,000 yuan, but there is still an outstanding debt of over 200,000 yuan. The province's finances are almost in a state of collapse. After reorganization, things began to show some progress. There are over 400 cases of county magistrates owing public funds, amounting to a substantial sum. We are now drafting ten measures to reorganize the collection of funds by county magistrates, which will be submitted to the provincial government for deliberation and implementation this Tuesday. The time limit for the allocation of funds to various counties is also strictly set. Those who fail to collect 40% to 50% of the allocated funds will be given demerits or dismissed. Currently, the province's monthly revenue is only over 400,000 yuan. Regarding the outstanding debts from the old budget, we will definitely clear them by the end of this fiscal year so that the new budget for the 19th year can begin, ensuring that Anhui's finances do not encounter difficulties again. My visit here is for this matter and to have talks with the banking community in Wuhu. I plan to return to the province tonight, or I may need to make a trip to Beijing temporarily."</p>
<p>Education Commissioner Cheng Tianfang previously went to northern Anhui for inspection and was scheduled to arrive in Wuhu from Beijing the day before yesterday afternoon. Officials from various agencies here waited at the riverfront to welcome him, but he did not arrive after the scheduled time. Everyone assumed that he had gone directly back to Anqing and did not disembark in Wuhu, so they all dispersed and returned home. Unexpectedly, Mr. Cheng arrived in the port from Beijing in the evening and disembarked, lodging at the Zhonghua Hotel by the river. The next morning, various sectors learned the news that Cheng had gone with Provincial Inspector Wang Dexi to inspect Provincial No. 7 Middle School, No. 2 Vocational School for Girls, and other schools. At 1:00 PM, the Education Funding Management Office, the Popular Education Center, and various middle schools held a welcome meeting at the Opera Stage, attended by over a thousand people. The chairman, Principal Ke Defa of No. 7 Middle School, delivered a welcoming speech, saying that since Commissioner Cheng came to Anhui, the province's education funding has increased by 300,000 yuan, and three more middle schools have been established, which is truly worth welcoming. Then Mr. Cheng took the stage to give a speech, briefly saying that there are several things he wants to tell the students today. The province's population totals 30 million, but there are only over 20 middle schools, with fewer than 10,000 students. This means that on average, only one person out of 3,000 receives middle school education. You must know that those who should bear major responsibilities for the country and society are not the uneducated people, nor are they the small number of university students who have received specialized education; they are entirely dependent on middle school students. China's international status is extremely dangerous. Political aggression is already alarming, and economic aggression is even more painful. For example, in the past, industrial and commercial goods mostly relied on foreign countries, but in recent years, even agricultural products such as rice and wheat, which are needed for people's food, are all seeking help from foreigners. The danger of national extinction and racial annihilation is imminent. The biggest common ills of the Chinese people are two: one is laziness, only thinking of enjoying the fruits of others' labor and unwilling to work hard; the other is disunity, unwilling to cooperate wholeheartedly and only knowing how to undermine each other. I deeply hope that we can get rid of these bad habits, work hard, and bear major responsibilities for the country and society. After the meeting, Mr. Cheng took the Jiang'an ship back to the province (the 15th).</p>

<p>Contact Also Made on Yongtai Side</p>
<p>Fuzhou Maintained by Marine Corps</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The Liu He Ding and Lu Xingbang divisions engaged in battle in the northwestern suburbs of Fuzhou. At 10:00 PM on the 9th, the Lu division's Qian Yu Guang and Chen Rong Biao regiments again engaged in fierce fighting with the Liu division's Jiang Yan and Yan Xi Min regiments at Ling Tou on the northern route and Wen Shan on the western route. The artillery fire was even heavier than on the 7th and 8th. By 6:00 AM on the 10th, the Lu division had suffered heavy casualties due to the Liu division's artillery bombardment. The Qian regiment, which was responsible for the northern route, completely collapsed, and regimental commander Qian Yu Guang disappeared (or it was rumored that he was shot by brigade commander Lu Xing Rong). The Chen regiment, which was responsible for the western route, also suffered heavy casualties, with one battalion commander captured and one battalion commander also retreating. The Liu division then cleared the battlefield on the 10th morning and afternoon and exchanged the troops in the front and rear to rest. From 10:00 PM on the 10th, the two sides again engaged in battle at Xiang Ling Creek on the northern route and Miao Feng Wen Shan on the western route. Because it was farther from the city, no gunfire was heard in the city. However, because the Lu division had been repeatedly defeated on the northwestern routes, it specially transferred over a thousand troops from Sun Guo Zhen's division's supplementary team, intending to invade Fuzhou's southern route from Yongtai County. From the morning of the 11th, they had already engaged in battle with the rear team of Chen Wan Tai's brigade of the Liu division. According to the Liu division's battle report, the enemy suffered over 1,000 casualties and abandoned over 800 rifles. The Second Brigade, which had been specially transferred and reorganized from the province's defense forces, led by brigade commander Lu Xin Ming, was dispatched from Yan Ping to the western countryside of Min Hou to join Lu Xing Rong and the two independent regiments of Chen Rong Biao and Wang Tian Rui. The Liu division also added Chen Wan Tai's brigade to the front line to join the two brigades of Gui Zhen Yuan and Liu Shang Zhi. It is estimated that the front-line troops of both sides numbered over 20,000. As for the defense of the rear in Fuzhou, it is now being maintained by the Marine Corps. The Third Regiment of the 22nd Brigade of the Marine Corps, led by Lin Bing Zhou, entered the city from Nantai Xiadu yesterday and is stationed at the former site of the Army Primary School in front of the Governor's Office. It is also heard that the Central Government may send two airplanes to Fujian within days to assist in the battle, and the South Parade Ground has been designated as the airfield (June 11th).</p>
<p>Another Dispatch: Lu He Ding specially transferred Chen's Brigade and its various regiments stationed in Quanzhou back to the province to support the defense. The brigade arrived yesterday (the 13th) at noon on eight ships, including the Zhenbo, and twelve洋駁 (洋駁), and was assigned to the front line that evening, changing from defense to offense. The previous battle news was slightly more intense from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM yesterday morning and from 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM today. According to investigations, yesterday morning, the Liu division's troops attacked the Lu side's position from Tong Pan Shan, the northern gate, and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Lu troops several times, occupying the position of the Shrine of Soldiers Killed in Action from the Li Hou Ji era. The Lu Xing Rong troops have retreated to Baisha, but the two sides are still in a stalemate. As for those in the provincial agencies who are related to the enemy, they have been severely investigated and arrested in recent days. For example, the Second Division's liaison office in the province, the dare-to-be detective's office, the Zhonghe Pharmacy in the city, and Deng's residence in Fushi Lane were sealed off and inspected. This afternoon, a Lu division scout named Chen Qing and others were temporarily arrested. However, this battle has lasted for a week, and the merchants and residents of the Fuzhou walls and the villages along the northwestern battle lines are all complaining endlessly. Therefore, rumors of naval mediation are rampant, and the people also have this hope so that they can be spared from the scourge of war as soon as possible (June 14th).</p>
<h3 id="e59">Zhejiang Province Implements Reduction of Silk Levy <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Levy Rate Reduced by One Quarter</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, in order to fundamentally remedy the declining silk industry in Zhejiang, has resolved two measures: (1) To encourage the use of machines to weave silk, the product will be completely tax-free. (2) The silk levy rate will be reduced by one quarter. The first measure of encouraging machine-woven silk has already been communicated to various counties for compliance. The second measure was delayed until yesterday due to the complicated procedures involved in tax revenue. It was communicated to various统捐局 (统捐局) for compliance, to be implemented from June 16th of the 19th year. All silk levy rates will be reduced by one quarter based on the original levy rates. The original annual payment of 400,000 yuan for silk levies collected by the Hangzhou Guancheng Hall and the silk levy office will also be reduced by one quarter from the 16th, totaling an annual amount of 300,000 yuan. However, the levy on rayon will be appropriately increased because the import of this item has increased sharply in recent years. After several negotiations between the Finance Department and the rayon levy office, it was decided to increase the original amount of 140,000 yuan by 10%, totaling an annual payment of 155,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Provincial Party Department Agrees to New Businessmen's Association's Demands</p>
<p>Guidance Committee Members All Elected</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Guangdong Provincial Party Department, in order to unify the businessmen's movement throughout the province, revoked the All-Province Businessmen's Association Reorganization Committee previously appointed to form an organization. It re-established methods for the organization of the Guangdong All-Province Businessmen's Organization Guidance Committee. The regulations stipulated that the committee would have nine members, with the old and new businessmen's associations each recommending three members from the thirteen people who attended the previous meeting, and the Party Department would add three members from the former Provincial Businessmen's Association to jointly form the committee. The old businessmen's association had already elected Liu Yin Xun, Chen Zan Chen, and Zhou Run Zhi. However, the new businessmen's association did not have enough members to meet the legal requirements, and they believed that the organization method of the Party Department adding three members from the former Provincial Businessmen's Association was not in accordance with the requirements. The Provincial Party Department's Training Department changed the proposal to have the Party Department appoint three members to avoid setting a precedent for the reorganization of business associations in various counties in the future. At that time, the Provincial Training Department did not express any opinions, which led to the new businessmen's association firmly opposing the election of committee members, causing twists and turns. On the morning of the 11th, the Provincial Training Department again urged the new businessmen's association members to go to the Party Department to elect three attending committee members. Liang Yucai and others then reiterated their reasons, requesting that the proposal of the Party Department adding three members from the Provincial Businessmen's Association be revoked and changed to the Party Department appointing three members instead of using the name of the Provincial Businessmen's Association, which had already been dissolved, before they would agree to the election. The attitude was extremely resolute. At that time, the Provincial Party Department Executive Committee was holding a meeting, and the Secretary of the Provincial Training Department, Lin, reported the matter to the Director of the Training Department, Chen Mingshu. Chen then explained to the new businessmen's association members that the Party Department was well aware of the content of the province's businessmen's groups and would never take sides. As for the addition of the three members from the former Provincial Businessmen's Association causing disputes, it could also be changed to accept the new businessmen's association's opinion of having the Party Department appoint three members instead of using the name of the Provincial Businessmen's Association. After listening, the seven members of the new businessmen's association, Hu Song Tang, Peng Chu Li, Liang Yu Cai, Zhi Zi Qing, Liang Jing Yun, Zhang Song Xian, and Liu Wei Wen, felt satisfied and, as the number of people had exceeded half of the thirteen, they immediately elected Zou Dian Bang, Peng Chu Li, and Liang Yu Cai as the result. Subsequently, the Provincial Party Department also appointed Cheng Shao Jie, Pan Qi Yuan, and Huo Jiong Tang to join the Liu Yin Xun, Chen Zan Chen, and Zhou Run Zhi, who had already been elected by the old businessmen's association, totaling nine people. At this point, the members of the Guangdong All-Province Businessmen's Organization Guidance Committee were all elected. Once a meeting is convened, they will immediately elect officers and draft regulations and take over the old and new business associations to intensify their work (the 12th).</p>

<p>The Sheng Zi Temple Robbery Case Solved:顧杏泉 (顧杏泉), the main bandit in the Sheng Zi Temple robbery case in Song territory, about two miles from Zhuanghang, was apprehended by Yang Xing Sheng, the police captain stationed in Zhuanghang County, on the 17th, together with Wang Jing Chuan of the Second Water Public Security Team, leading ship captain Shen Peng Tu disguised as前往 (前往) Xiaobazi Bridge in Shiyitu, Yexie, where Song and Feng join. He was immediately taken to Zhuanghang for interrogation. At first, he was extremely cunning and only admitted to being involved in the robbery case at Yu Min Qing's house in Zhangjia Tang. Later, after six interrogations by Yang, he confessed that the ringleader was Yin De Liang, who had fled to Gu Punan in Song territory and recruited twelve accomplices, including three from Shanghai. They set off at 7:00 PM that afternoon. Except for two people holding wooden sticks, each of the others had four匣子砲 (匣子砲), rifles, and pistols. When they arrived in the town, they guarded the bridges on the roads to and from the town, and four people went to the police station to劫械 (劫械). Then they began robbing separately.

<p>The Urgent Progress of Widening Er Xia Tang Street: At the beginning of its establishment, the Wuxi Municipal Preparatory Office first proposed opening the Park Avenue and the North-South main roads, advocating first widening theZhenying道菴 (Zhenying道菴) and San Xia Qing. However, it failed to realize this due to obstacles. When the Municipal Preparatory Office was ordered to be dissolved, the Municipal Engineering was expanded and taken over by the Construction Bureau, which determined that organizing road traffic was the key to municipal construction. It decided to continue the plan of the former Municipal Preparatory Office and continue to carry it out. At the same time, Yu Zhong Huan, a native of the city who was traveling in Beijing, suggested that the widening of roads should start from the San Xia Qing Straight Street and the Zhenyingdao Alley. The Municipal Engineering Office has decided to follow the planned program and first measure San Xia Tang for the first widening. Surveyors Zhang Zai Qu and Gu Yu Cheng have been dispatched to start measuring yesterday and are limited to completing the measurement within three days. The street there is about fifteen feet wide, and it has now been decided to widen it to thirty feet in one step, from He Bridge in the south to Beisheng Alley in the north.</p>
<p>The Zheng犯 (郑犯) in the Mu Bin Extortion Case is Apprehended: In the case of the former Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Mu Bin, being extorted by bandits, the police detectives of the Public Security Bureau successively arrested the main criminals in the case, Hang Bing Kui and Lu Xue Li. After two interrogations by Director Huang, Hang and others confessed that the Zheng犯 (郑犯) in the case was actually Deng A San and the accomplice Zhou Lv Dong, who are now hiding in Xicun Li. Based on the confession, Director Huang immediately dispatched police detectives to arrest the two suspects, Deng and Zhou, at the address. Zhou refused to admit his guilt and said his surname was Jiang. After being escorted to the bureau, Director Huang interrogated him severely for a long time, but he still claimed his surname was Jiang and refused to change his mind. When Hang Bing Kui was brought to the court to confront him, Deng finally bowed his head and said nothing. Director Huang then ordered Hang Bing Kui to silently write down the first two of the threatening letters he had sent to Mu Bin. After comparing them, the handwriting was the same as the original letters, and the content was also quite similar. Hang further confessed that the sending of the threatening letter was Deng's idea, and he was just being foolish by Deng. Based on the confession, Director Huang ordered that the criminals be transferred to the county government prison. The case lasted half a month from the day it occurred to the day it was solved. The bandits sent a total of five threatening letters, and they had agreed to reply in the Ta Kung Pao. Before the day of the arrest, Mu Bin received three telephone calls from the bandits urging him to pay the money. There were more than twenty police detectives who participated in the arrest, all disguised as waiters in hotels, fishmongers, street cleaners, boatmen, vendors, gate watchers, or cab drivers, each carrying pistols and芭斗 (芭斗) by their side. The shops in the Bali area were initially surprised by the sudden arrival of many volunteer waiters who volunteered to work. The variety of disguises was truly a wonderful detective novel.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Establishes Department of Chinese Studies <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Appoints Jiang Kanghu as Department Head</p>
<p>Since the Great War, educators in various European and American countries with a global perspective have been interested in bridging Eastern and Western cultures to create a basis for world harmony. Therefore, they have collected Chinese classics without reservation. For example, the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., and the library of McGill University (transliteration) in Canada each hold more than 100,000 volumes of Chinese books and continue to add to them without slackening. Their attention to our country's culture can be imagined. According to a recent report in the San Francisco Times, McGill University in Montreal, Canada, has decided to establish a Department of Chinese Studies starting this autumn and has appointed Dr. Jiang Kanghu of our country as the department head and chief lecturer. At the same time, Collie University has specially invited Mr. Jiang to teach Eastern philosophy and art. This is truly the beginning of the practical integration of Eastern and Western cultures and will have a positive impact on our country's international standing.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Important Issues Concerning Libraries <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Education's Instructions to the China Library Association</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously received a report from the China Library Association based on the resolutions of the first annual meeting, requesting adoption. The Ministry of Education recently replied to the association, stating that the report and proposals were noted and that some of the points were worthy of adoption. The replies are as follows: (1) "Regarding the promulgation of laws and regulations for establishing library standards": The library regulations were promulgated on May 10. As for the establishment standards, the Ministry is currently conducting a survey of the situation of libraries nationwide and plans to solicit opinions from library experts before compiling them. (2) "Regarding increasing library funding": The funds for social education should be temporarily set at 10% to 20% of the total education funding. This was previously approved by the former University Council and reported to the National Government, and orders were issued to comply with it. However, the scope of social education is very broad, and libraries are one of the social education endeavors. It is difficult to use all the social education funds exclusively for this one endeavor. Therefore, the proportion of direct funding will be temporarily postponed to allow for flexibility. As for the book purchasing expenses for schools at all levels, orders should be issued to pay special attention to it and determine it appropriately. (3) "Regarding encouraging the establishment of libraries": The Second National Education Conference resolved to prepare for the establishment of a central library within eighteen years. The Ministry is currently planning to carry it out. Before the central library is established, a library department will be established within the Central Education Center this year to collect and display Chinese and foreign books related to education. As for various specialized and general public and children's libraries, the Ministry plans to order the education departments of various provinces and the education bureaus of various special municipalities to actively increase their establishment starting this year. (4) "Regarding the need for experts to guide the development of library services": Permission is granted to instruct the education departments of various provinces and the education bureaus of various special municipalities to handle this matter appropriately. (5) "Regarding the importance of specialized library personnel": (1) The establishment of specialized library schools should be temporarily postponed. Subsidies for already established library schools should be handled in accordance with the regulations for private schools. (2) Permission is granted to instruct universities to add library science courses or library science departments to their faculties of arts or education. (3) Permission is granted to instruct the education departments of various provinces, the education bureaus of various special municipalities, and Tsinghua University to appropriately determine the number of library science students to be sent abroad each year. (4) The Ministry's interim standards for primary and secondary school curricula are currently being tested. When they are revised in the future, library science can be appropriately added. Guidance on the use of systematic books and publications in schools at all levels is temporarily not required to be specified by the Ministry. (6) "Regarding the implementation of the resolutions of the First National Education Conference": The former University Council has already selected and issued orders to comply with the main points. (7) "Regarding the implementation of the Publishing Law": The formulation of copyright and publishing laws falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior. The regulations for submitting newly published books promulgated by the former University Council have now been revised by the Ministry. The regulations for submitting books by various bookstores stipulate that each bookstore must submit four copies of newly published books to the provincial education department or special municipal education bureau where the publisher is located. One copy will be kept by the provincial or municipal education administrative agency, and the remaining three copies will be forwarded to the Ministry for distribution to the Ministry's library, the Central Education Center, and the Central Library. Requiring more copies to be submitted is clearly inconsistent with the provisions of the case and cannot be followed. Furthermore, although the National Romanization has been promulgated, it is only the second method for promoting the national language and can be used by scholars for reference and research. Its promotion has not yet become widespread, and it is not appropriate to force its immediate implementation. (8) "Regarding reducing the price of educational books and newspapers": Permission is granted for the Ministry to instruct various educational institutions to comply with this. (9) "Regarding rewarding those who wholeheartedly engage in library work": "Permission is granted to handle this in accordance with the regulations on donating funds to establish schools." (10) "Regarding stipulating independent administrative control of school libraries": Due to many practical difficulties, there is no need to discuss this. (11) "Regarding the transfer of the official book bureaus of various provinces to the management of provincial libraries": The situations of the official book bureaus in various provinces are different. If it is necessary and possible to merge the official book bureaus in various provinces and regions, a request should be submitted to the competent authorities of the province for investigation and approval. (12) "Regarding the stipulation to hold a Library Movement Week": This can be promoted incidentally during literacy campaigns or public education lectures in various provinces or special municipalities, without holding it separately. Please take note of the above points separately.</p>

<p>Totaling 2.07 Million Yuan</p>
<p>An Increase of 370,000 Yuan Compared to the Previous Year</p>
<p>The new budget (for the 19th year) for Anhui Province's education funds has been compiled and is currently awaiting review by the provincial government. The total amount of this budget is 2.07 million yuan, an increase of 370,000 yuan compared to the previous year. This is because one new middle school (Chuxian Middle School), three vernacular education halls (one each in Datong, Tunxi, and Zhengyang), one public sports field (converted from the Huazhong venue), and one rural normal school (converted from the private rural normal school in Bengbu) should be added this year, requiring a total of 80,000 yuan for establishment and recurring expenses. The cost of studying abroad has increased significantly due to changes in the price of gold and increased subsidies for domestic universities, totaling more than 40,000 yuan. In addition, the number of classes in the original primary and secondary schools has increased, the food expenses for normal school students have increased (from 5 yuan per person to 6 yuan), and the labor and food expenses for servants and workers have increased (from 8 yuan per person to 9 yuan). Therefore, the increase is as described above and will be reviewed by the provincial government.</p>

It is estimated that a total of approximately 200,000 yuan is needed for establishment expenses and approximately 240,000 yuan for annual recurring expenses. It is proposed that a portion of the recurring expenses be discussed and allocated by the committee in consultation with the relevant provinces, and that the remaining portion and the establishment expenses be requested by the committee to the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds. The proposal was discussed and resolved at the conference to consult with the Ministry of Education before jointly submitting a request to the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds so that it could be established as soon as possible.</p>

All of the Jiaozhou Road school buildings will be transferred to the school for use as school buildings. The buildings are spacious, the transportation is convenient, and there is a large playground of more than ten acres. It is a good place for young students to study and exercise. It is reported that the school will implement the relocation starting on July 1. All matters such as the summer school for the seventeenth and nineteenth years and the autumn recruitment of new students will be handled at the Jiaozhou Road school building.</p>

<h3 id="e94">My Opinion on the Failure of the Chinese Basketball Team (Member Lu Zhongen) <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>I am one of the members of the Chinese basketball team that attended the Far Eastern Games. I should not have any discussion about the entire team, but since Mr. Xu's commentary was published in this column on Sunday, I cannot bear not to briefly share my humble opinions with the readers for a study.</p>
<p>The players representing our country this time are all first-class talents. Therefore, the people of the country have a 12-point belief in this year's team. Victory is not worth mentioning. How can one know that there are unexpected things in the world? Unemotional news came, turning the championship that the public thought we had into a castle in the air. Depressed and frustrated, there is no end to it. However, my concept is the opposite of the public. Before departure, I repeatedly discussed with friends the possible dangers of this year's championship. The main points that I expected are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e95">Intellectual Aspects <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>(1) In terms of individual temperament, our team members generally lack self-restraint. Each person's character seems too fervent. Every time they step onto the field, they inevitably become overly eager to win and lose control of themselves. There are two main reasons for this: first, a lack of experience; second, the overwhelming cheers of our countrymen cause a sense of bewilderment among the young players. They feel nervous and anxious. During the first match against Japan, I observed from the sidelines that after our players got the ball, they seemed at a loss, unsure whether to advance, retreat, shoot, or pass. They either failed to act when they should have, or acted inappropriately, resulting in no success.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Technical Aspects <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>(1) During regular practice, there is insufficient preparation in both offense and defense. The only offensive tactics emphasized are the center jump and out-of-bounds plays from the defensive area. There is no practice for out-of-bounds plays on the sidelines, rebounding under the basket, or offensive plays during free throws. In defense, only one tactic is emphasized: the five-man revolve system. From what I've seen in basketball games, there are six types of offensive and defensive strategies (I won't go into detail now, but I can discuss them further when I have time). Within these six types, each team should have at least two: one for dealing with brave and reckless teams, and another for dealing with agile and skillful teams. The Philippines team is like Shanghai’s Hujiang and Xiqing, always setting traps. If our team only has one tactic, the chances of winning a complete victory are slim. The first and second matches should not use the same strategy, because the opponent will be prepared for the second match. A ball game is like a battle: the best strategy is to attack when the enemy is unprepared. Japan is certainly brave, but if China can outsmart them (like the Philippines did against Japan), victory will not be difficult. As for the Philippines, our Chinese team has a very good chance of winning. Unfortunately, bad luck and unexpected changes led to defeat. These points are sufficient to prove that my predictions for this championship were not unfounded, but the extent of our defeats in each match was beyond my expectations.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Four Matches <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The lineup for the first match against Japan was: Tang Baokun, Yao Enhan, Liu Jianchang, Li Guochen, and Wang Xiliang. After the start, the Japanese team quickly scored six points, causing confusion in the Chinese team. We could only parry but not counterattack. It wasn't until the last ten minutes when Wei Pengyun replaced Yao Enhan that the team showed any improvement. With three minutes remaining, the coach replaced Wang Xiliang with me (which wasn't necessary). After entering the game, I seized a good opportunity to score a basket from under the hoop. The whistle blew and the buzzer sounded. China lost to Japan by fifteen points (a new Far Eastern record). In this match, our two forwards, Liu and Yao, did not perform well, and the players' movements were very sluggish. The Japanese team, on the other hand, were incredibly brave, with their two forwards scoring more than thirty points. With such effective offense and defense, it's no wonder we suffered a defeat.</p>
<p>The lineup for the second match against the Philippines was: Tang Baokun, Yao Enhan, Liu Jianchang, Li Guochen, and me. Our team showed much more progress compared to the first match. Unfortunately, Tang was closely guarded and had no scoring opportunities during his three free throws. If Tang could have played to his strengths, our team's victory would have been predictable.</p>
<p>The lineup for the third match against Japan was: Tang Baokun, Wei Pengyun, Liu Jianchang, Li Guochen, and me. According to the coach's instructions, we used a man-to-man defense. Unfortunately, we had no practice with this strategy, so it was disorganized. After ten minutes, Wang Xiliang replaced me. By the end of the first half, we were down by ten points. In the second half, the lineup was changed again, with Chen Chenkui, Yao Enhan, Wang Yuzeng, and Liu Guanjun joining me. After the start, our team played very bravely, with Chen, Yao, and Wang each scoring a basket. The Japanese team then called a timeout. After the restart, the Japanese scored two more baskets, and our team called a timeout. While we were discussing strategy, the coach suddenly replaced the entire lineup. At this point, there were still ten minutes left in the game, and there was hope for a comeback. Who knew that after this substitution, we would collapse completely and lose to the Japanese by another seventeen points. What a tragedy!</p>
<p>The lineup for the fourth match against the Philippines was: Tang Baokun, Chen Shengkui, Wang Yuzeng, Liu Guanjun, and me. As soon as the whistle blew, the two sides engaged in a fierce contest. Our team fought desperately, and the score was ten to two in our favor. When the score reached twenty to nine, Li Guochen replaced me, Yao Enhan replaced Chen, and Liu Jianchang replaced Wang. By the end of the first half, our team was ahead by thirty to fifteen. After the start of the second half, the Philippines team suddenly displayed their ultimate skills and launched a strong attack. The score gradually narrowed. With only five points separating the teams, I re-entered the game and Liu Guanjun left. Our team's momentum picked up again, with Li, Liu, and I each scoring a basket. The crowd cheered. Our team's performance was excellent, and we were evenly matched with the Philippines. But disaster struck from the sky! Xing suddenly fouled for the fourth time and was disqualified. Liu re-entered the game. After this substitution, our team's morale suddenly collapsed, and the Philippines team launched a fierce counterattack. As a result, our team lost to the Philippines by four points, resulting in four losses in four matches.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Overview <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The reason for these defeats was not due to a lack of technical skill, but rather a lack of essential basketball knowledge. In addition to what I've mentioned, there are a couple of other points worth noting:</p>
<p>(1) The discipline of our basketball team members was unmatched by other teams. Apart from attending meetings, everyone rested in the dormitory all day and never stepped out of line. As a result, the players were constantly thinking about the games. They regarded basketball as more important than their own lives, which led to bewilderment and confusion when they got the ball during the matches.</p>
<p>(2) In each match, there was no one to command the team's movements and serve as the team's leader (the same problem as the soccer team this year). As a result, when one person panicked, the entire team was thrown into chaos, leading to an unrecoverable disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e99">What About the Referees? <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Various newspapers have offered very detailed commentary on the referees. But from my perspective, the referees in this competition had absolutely no experience in officiating, and they were also unfamiliar with the rules. I recall that during the first match, I discussed the new rules with them (such as the regulations for jump balls and free throws) for about two minutes, and they had no answers. As a result, the referee's inappropriate rulings sparked discontent among the spectators. Of course, the referees have a close relationship with the competition, but in light of the results of this competition, our team's defeat cannot be entirely blamed on the referees. If our team could have calmly faced Japan and the Philippines with our inherent abilities, I can confidently say that victory would have been within our grasp. Look at the Philippines' victory over Japan. Were the referees any less incompetent? Yet, the Philippines team maintained their composure throughout, outmaneuvering their opponents with ingenuity and winning the championship. In conclusion, based on the standard of the previous matches, the Philippines team was the best and the Chinese team was the worst. But from my perspective, if our team could have all played to their strengths and remained calm, the championship would have been ours.</p>
<p>Well, there's no point in dwelling on the past. The next tournament is four years away. I hope that our countrymen who are passionate about sports can promote and encourage them tirelessly and impartially. Everyone should have the spirit of drawing their swords and fighting bravely, so that we can wash away the shame of this year in the next tournament. I will discuss how to promote and encourage this when I have time. Before departing, I had intended to publish the training process and the possibilities and impossibilities of winning the championship in the newspapers, but I was afraid of causing misunderstandings, so I dared not try.</p>

<p>Liangjiang No. 27 News, No. 26</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 17th) at 4 p.m., the Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team, at the invitation of the News Team, competed at the China Basketball Hall. They used men's rules. The News Team is composed of people from the local news and sports circles, and their strength is exceptionally strong. But since the Liangjiang team has been practicing men's rules, their progress in basketball skills has been significant. It can be seen from their victory yesterday. As soon as the whistle blew, both sides started chasing after each other. In less than a minute, Liangjiang's Zhuang Shuyu scored the first point, followed by Shao Jinying with another, making it 4-0, taking the lead. Seeing the fierce attack, the News Team fought back hard, and Pei Xiyuan, Zhuang Huaiqing and others scored successively. At the end of the first quarter, the News Team was ahead with 6-4. In the second quarter, Liangjiang tried to recover, and the defense gradually became more stable, while the forwards were exceptionally agile. Shao Jinying and Xi Jun scored points one after another, and the score increased steadily. At the end of the first half, Liangjiang turned the tables and won with 18-14. At the beginning of the second half, the two teams were close in score, so the competition was even more intense. The News Team was gradually running out of stamina, while the Liangjiang team was more flexible. So at the end of the third quarter, Liangjiang won again with 24-18. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, the News Team was in a bad situation and had to try hard to save the situation, so the competition was unprecedentedly fierce. In the News Team, Lu Xiangqian ran the entire court and was the most outstanding player. As expected, the score gradually caught up, becoming a tie at 26. At this time, the score was equal, and both teams were in a critical situation, making the audience restless. Then, the News Team was penalized for a foul, and Liangjiang scored a point. Before the timekeeper announced the end, Liangjiang won with 27-26 and returned in triumph.</p>

<p>The Citibank Club's table tennis team was established not long ago, but its achievements have been outstanding. They have played against various groups and have seen wins and losses. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., they played a friendly match against the Guangdong Women's Table Tennis Team at the bank's clubhouse. Zhou Jianwen and Lu Zhongqiu were invited to be the referees, and Zhou temporarily asked Luo Hongsheng to replace him. More than a hundred people from all walks of life attended the match. A total of nine matches were played, and Citibank won with 6-3. The team won because Liang Hankan, Bao Sheng, Chen Linsheng and others defended well. The Guangdong team was ultimately weaker because the players were women, so although they fought hard, they lost. However, the skills of Lin Murong and Li Ruifen were enough to shock the Chinese and Western audiences in the entire venue. After the match, Citibank provided exquisite Western refreshments for the team. The team leader, Mai Zhaohua, and the secretaries, Zhao Shuhai and He Xinghua (a Westerner), were responsible for the reception. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and took photos before dispersing. It is said that Citibank plans to invite various groups in Shanghai to play friendly matches to learn from each other.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Random Notes on Studying Japanese Education (3) <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>(Hu Shuyi)</p>
<p>In Tokyo, in addition to the Municipal Education Bureau, there is the Tokyo Prefectural Education Department. After our visit, we felt that the organization and uniformity and practicality were the strengths of Japanese educational administration; however, it seemed to pay relatively little attention to research and guidance. In our discussions of educational systems, we learned that Japan's secondary education section is extremely complex, with seven-year-system high schools, middle schools, higher girls' schools, higher primary schools, normal schools, vocational schools, and vocational supplementary schools all distinct. As for normal school education, it has an independent system. Normal schools require graduation from higher elementary school and then entry into higher normal schools above vocational schools, their status on par with universities. This is the biggest difference from our country's school system. Perhaps the spirit of Japanese education lies in this point. On the afternoon of the 20th, at 1:00 PM, we went to the municipal Hisamatsu Normal Elementary School for a tour. The school is located in Hisamatsu-cho, Nihonbashi Ward, Tokyo. The school was founded in Meiji 6. It was rebuilt after the Tokyo Great Earthquake into a modern Western-style building made of steel and reinforced concrete. The cost of the building and equipment totaled 530,000 yen. Its perfection in architecture and equipment cannot be compared even with our country’s universities. We heard that the Tokyo City Government plans to build all elementary schools in the future in this style, showing their emphasis on elementary education. We were very impressed. After talking with the principal, we learned that the school grounds are about 60,175 square feet, with 1,250 students and 28 teachers. The highest salary is 180 yen per month, and the lowest is 55 yen. The total annual expenditure is more than 35,000 yen. In addition to educational administrative organs, school development matters are helped by the alumni association and the family support association, and the latter's enthusiasm for education is particularly admirable. They often donate to the school for economic construction, so the school's undertakings are thriving. Looking back at our country's schools at all levels, there are many families who do not interact with the school, let alone others. On May 21st, we visited the Tokyo School for the Deaf. The principal told us that the school was founded in Meiji 8. The teaching method initially used the finger-spelling method, but recently adopted the face-shape and mouth-shape teaching method, that is, pronunciation teaching, which is more effective. There are currently 122 students and 45 teachers. Most of the students are boarders and do not pay tuition. There are also normal school classes and research classes as teacher training institutions for deaf schools. As for the student graduation exit problem, we learned that the school has vocational subjects such as woodworking and various crafts, as well as tailoring, painting, and other skills. Being literate and having vocational skills means that those who would have been useless have, through the school's cultivation, become useful talents to society. The method is excellent. The teachers then led us to visit the school's various facilities and teaching methods, all of which were worthwhile. The students' handicrafts were exquisite and lovely, and there were also electric motors available for students to use in metalworking and woodworking. We heard that this school is a famous special education school in Tokyo. In the afternoon, we visited the private Takimien Girls' School. After talking with the principal for a week, we learned that the school is representative of the old-fashioned girls' schools in Tokyo. Its educational purpose is limited to literacy and further education. There are more than 800 students and more than 30 teachers. The annual cost is about 50,000 yen. After graduation, most of them go to women's universities. Teacher salaries range from 60 to 200 yen. The school buildings are not very spacious, but they are clean and tidy. The students are simple and polite. These are roughly the two major characteristics of the school. (May 23, Tokyo)</p>

<h3 id="e105">Request from the Business Reorganization Committee <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>To Restrict Gold Futures Trading</p>
<p>The Business Reorganization Committee sent letters yesterday to organizations such as the Gold Exchange, the Bankers Association, and the Foreign Banks Association regarding the restriction of gold futures trading. The letter stated: "We previously reported that the sharp rise in gold prices has greatly affected commerce and people's livelihoods. Various business organizations have repeatedly requested that appropriate measures be discussed and submitted to the authorities for remedy. The committee, mindful of the importance of its duties and aware of the complexity of the issue, has repeatedly held serious discussions with the financial sector and various organizations. It has consulted with representatives of the Bankers Association and the Money Exchange Association and agreed on four measures, which have been submitted to the Ministries of Finance and Industry for adoption and implementation. At the same time, letters have been sent to the relevant Chinese and foreign commercial firms for consideration. Currently, there are many opinions that the sharp rise in gold prices is due to speculation and manipulation, and there are proposals to suspend trading on the gold exchange as a remedy. This complex issue is not easy to resolve rashly. Moreover, futures trading actually has the effect of averaging commodity prices, so it would be wrong to ban it outright. However, the ratio of world prices to gold prices should be around two shillings, but it has now risen to around one shilling and five pence, which is clearly affected by large-scale speculative trading. Therefore, it seems that the opinions are not without merit. The committee believes that in order to prevent manipulation by speculators, any non-import/export businesses engaged in gold futures trading or foreign exchange that is not required for their business and is only aimed at gaining unexpected windfall profits should be restricted. This restriction will not hinder legitimate commercial activities and will reduce market turmoil. Therefore, Item 3 of the proposed remedial measures restricts non-import/export businesses from engaging in gold futures trading or purchasing foreign exchange. Banks' foreign exchange transactions are also limited to transactions with import/export businesses. After the implementation of this measure, the business of some of the relevant commercial firms may be reduced, but it can consolidate the overall situation of the Chinese and foreign commercial markets. When weighing the pros and cons, we hope to receive your support. We are sending this letter specifically to inform you and request that you take note and circulate it to your colleagues for handling."</p>

<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Reiterated the Prohibition</p>
<p>Recently, a small number of rice shops and rice merchants in this city have colluded to disrupt public order and secretly purchased white rice at discounted prices. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau issued an order to the Rice Trade Organization's Reorganization Committee, stating: "We have received a report from the committee stating that rice prices in the northern market have become chaotic again. Merchants are demanding prices that exceed the limited prices and refuse to sell at lower prices. The market is being controlled by the merchants. If this situation continues, the committee will be unable to maintain the limited prices. According to this, if there is evidence that merchants are disrupting the limited prices, they should be severely punished to maintain the rice market. The industry should name and report these merchants instead of using ambiguous language to evade responsibility. We hereby order the Reorganization Committee to inform the industry to strictly abide by the limited prices and not to disrupt the market. If any merchants are found to be refusing to sell or are secretly discounting prices, they should be reported to the bureau immediately for investigation. Any rice shops or merchants who fail to report and are secretly discounting prices will be punished together."</p>

He is expected to return south around the end of the month.</p>
<p>Mongolian Conference Delegation</p>
<h3 id="e110">Passed Through Shanghai Yesterday for Sightseeing in Hangzhou <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Inner Mongolian Representatives Talk About the Conference</p>
<p>A delegation of more than 70 representatives to the Mongolian Conference arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing at 4:30 PM yesterday. With the exception of a few representatives from Rehe who stayed in Shanghai, the rest took the 5:55 PM train to Hangzhou for sightseeing. The Zhejiang Provincial Government sent representatives to Shanghai to welcome them. Wu Heling and Anhui Provincial Chairman Yan Fuxiang did not come due to illness. Our reporter interviewed Tong Jizhong, a representative of the Zosutu League of Rehe, at the train station yesterday and asked about the conference. He replied that the decisions regarding Mongolian education were made in accordance with the resolutions of the Second National Education Conference. Regarding administrative organizations, the Mongolian representatives initially proposed that each league organize a League Government with a Banner Government under it. However, the terminology was deemed inappropriate, so it was changed to a League Public Office with one League Chief and one Deputy League Chief, one Assistant Officer, and one Military Officer. Each League is completely independent and directly under the Central Government. Under the League Public Office is the Banner Public Office, which is headed by one Banner Chief with powers similar to those of an administrative officer. Under him are a number of Banner Affairs Officers, the number of which depends on the size of the banner: six for large banners, four for medium banners, and two for small banners. As for military affairs, it was decided to organize a security team on a banner basis, with ten to twenty men from each company. Large banners have about twenty companies, so the number of security team members is about 200 to 400. The weapons and equipment will be subsidized by the Central Government. In general, this conference was not entirely satisfactory, but everything cannot be accomplished overnight. Therefore, we hope for gradual improvement. Our delegation plans to take a boat to Tianjin in a few days and then return to Suiyuan by land. One more thing that is noteworthy from the conference is that the Zhangjia Living Buddha's office in Beijing submitted a document to the Executive Yuan denying the Inner Mongolian representatives and the resolutions. The representatives issued a declaration opposing this. Since the Zhangjia Living Buddha is the head of Lamaism, he has no right to interfere in administrative matters. Therefore, the conference has decided to abolish the Lama Temple Printing Office organization to prevent administrative chaos.</p>

<p>The Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission recently decided that since Shanghai is the distribution center for most overseas Chinese who return home for sightseeing, business, or education, it has requested and received approval from the Central Government to set up a liaison office in Shanghai to facilitate guidance and promote overseas Chinese affairs. The office will handle the reception and inquiries of overseas Chinese arriving in Shanghai. The location has been selected as Building 2, 58 Laobazi Road, North Sichuan Road, Shanghai. In the future, if overseas Chinese comrades return home and are introduced by the local general branch, Overseas Chinese Guidance Committee, or local party branch, the office will send personnel to the ship to receive them and provide guidance after they disembark.</p>

<p>Greatest Impact on Chinese Goods</p>
<p>According to sources from the US Commercial Office in Shanghai, the new tariff rates, which were last revised by the US government, will be announced and implemented this week.

The tariffs on most Chinese goods exported to the United States have been increased significantly. Therefore, the implementation of the new tariff rates will have the greatest impact on Chinese exporters. The details of the tariff rates will be known after they are announced.</p>
<p>Anqing Public Wharf Case</p>
<h3 id="e116">Open Letter from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to the People of Anhui <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Opposing Economic Invasion by Foreign Merchants</p>
<p>Upholding the Development of National Shipping Rights</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of setting up a public wharf in Anqing, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company believes that the Anhui Provincial Government's reply has not fundamentally revoked or prohibited foreign ships from docking. The company considers this matter to be of great importance and yesterday issued a declaration urging the people of Anhui to support the development of Chinese shipping rights. The declaration stated: Our company has always attached importance to river transport and wharf facilities. We have both superior and newer, faster ships. Recently, the nation has taken over the foundation of the domestic shipping industry, and we observe the ardent expectations of the people. We strive to strengthen ourselves and dare not slacken, hoping to recover shipping rights and reduce losses. However, the economic invasion by foreign merchants is not a matter of a single day. We must rely on everyone's collective efforts to achieve success. The Yangtze River shipping rights are gradually declining, and the Chinese people are working hard to recover them. Fortunately, the port of Anqing remains intact, and foreign ships cannot dock according to the treaty. This is a rare achievement. How should the Chinese people cherish it? Our company deeply feels the importance of its responsibilities and has never imitated foreign ships in hoarding and monopolizing. We are working hard to rectify ourselves to benefit the people of Anhui (omitted middle section). The water freight prices have increased significantly in various ports, but Anqing is the only port with lower freight for the largest volume of exports, and passenger ticket prices remain at the old rates of ten years ago. Our company's special-class ships are significantly cheaper than ordinary foreign ships by 20%. We do everything in our power to reduce the burden on the Chinese people. Our company has moved the newly renovated Wuhu wharf, which cost tens of thousands of dollars, to Anqing for use. Passengers going up and down the river are not charged any fees. We have eight ships running on the Yangtze River, which are sufficient for cargo and passenger needs. If there is a cargo backlog, we can add more seagoing ships at any time. All these facts are known to the world. If there are any shortcomings, they are inevitable. We express our sincere intentions to seek guidance from our fellow countrymen. The prosperity or decline of our company's affairs is related to the nation's shipping rights and the honor and disgrace of the people of Anhui.</p>
<p>The Chinese Cigarette Industry</p>
<h3 id="e117">Yesterday's Petition to Party and Government Organs <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Stating the Painful Situation</p>
<p>Requesting Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Manufacturers Association has recently decided to send representatives to Beijing to petition for relief due to the deteriorating environment and the imminent collapse of their businesses. It was also decided that before this, each factory, together with representatives of their workers, would make a preliminary request for relief from the city's party, government, and tax authorities to strengthen their efforts. This was previously reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the city's petition event took place yesterday. At 8:00 AM, no less than two hundred male and female workers from various cigarette factories gathered before and behind the association's premises. More than ten cars were prepared. Around 9:00 AM, they proceeded one after another to the City Party Headquarters at Baiyun Temple. Each person held a white flag with various slogans written on them, such as "Implement the Principle of People's Livelihood to relieve factory and worker life," "Break economic aggression," "Implement equal treatment, abolish narrow tax revenues," and "Demand a box flower system and promote domestic goods." They chanted slogans, and the order was excellent. At the gate of the Party Headquarters, they got out of the cars together and lined up. The petition representatives, Lao Jingxiu, Yao Jixian, Bao Gengsheng, etc., went to see the City Executive Committee, where they were received by Committee Member Tao Baichuan, who inquired in detail about the various painful situations of the Chinese factories. He agreed to discuss the matter properly and forward it to the Central Party Headquarters for consideration and relief. He also agreed to request the tax rules files from the Cigarette Unified Tax Office for research. The representatives were very satisfied and expressed their gratitude before leaving. They then went to the City Government at Fenglin Bridge to petition. They were received by Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, where the chief representative, Lao Jingxiu, etc., reiterated the painful situation and requested relief. They were promised that methods of relief would be discussed and urgently submitted to the National Government for approval. They then went to the Social Affairs Bureau at Xiaonanmen, where they expressed their pain as before. It was already lunchtime, and the office was closed. Chen Zeyi accepted the petition and promised to convey it to the director and urgently seek relief. They then led the team to the Chamber of Commerce and had a brief rest in the assembly hall. The representatives stated the reasons for the petition, and committee members Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaolai, and Yu Zhihao received them and discussed the matter for a long time. They promised to do their best to help. Then, the team went to the Cigarette Unified Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance on Sanma Road at the Customs House, where Secretary Dong Zhongding received them. In addition to promising to forward the request to the Ministry of Finance to relieve the pain of the Chinese factories, he also resolved two local issues: (1) It is proposed that Hebei flower stamps be exempted from export tax by analogy with the sales in the Jin-Sui area. (2) All officials and subordinates are notified that they must protect cigarette merchants in tax administration and must not be overly punitive. During these six hours, the hundreds of people acted appropriately and did not cause any accidents. The energy spent by the leaders of the various teams and the leading representatives was truly remarkable. The petition submitted to the City Party Headquarters and the City Government is recorded below (omitting titles): The Chinese cigarette industry relies heavily on American tobacco as raw material to cater to the needs of society. Three years ago, the exchange rate of US dollars to Shanghai taels was about 70 taels per 100 US dollars. Recently, it has plummeted to between 34 and 35 taels. The surge in gold prices has broken all previous records. The cost has increased more than doubled compared to before. If we want to increase prices, we are restricted by tax levels, and the price increase is not enough to offset the cigarette tax of the sixth grade. If we want to close down, it will hinder the livelihoods of workers. Worker unemployment is related to social stability. Therefore, the situation of Chinese cigarette merchants today is that they cannot make a living by advancing, and they cannot close down by retreating. They have reached a dead end. On the 6th of this month, the association convened an emergency meeting and resolved three relief measures, which were telegraphed to the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry for review. So far, we have not received any approval. Assuming the government agrees to provide relief, there is still hope of coming back to life. Otherwise, it can be said with certainty that the dozens of remaining cigarette factories and tens of thousands of cigarette factory workers will all become successors to Nanyang within a year. Now, representatives have been jointly elected by various factories to petition together. We humbly request that our Ministry (City) Chiefs provide unified assistance, forward the same-day telegram and request to the Yuan and Ministry for approval of the three relief measures, and sincerely accept it, so that our Chinese cigarette industry can continue to survive for a while and leave a glimmer of hope. The pain of being captured is a matter of life and death, and we do not choose our words urgently. We sincerely hope that you will understand.</p>

The establishment of a special committee to take full responsibility and submit the organizational regulations of the special committee to the central government for approval was approved. In order to facilitate supervision, the special committee requested and was approved to move to Shanghai to facilitate progress. Previously, personnel were sent to Shanghai to rent a Western-style house at No. 8 Museum Road in the Public Concession as the committee's address, and a meeting was held last Friday. Two representatives from the Shanghai Special Municipality attended the meeting. The Shanghai Dredging Bureau has sent foreign engineers to submit the regulations and drawings of the Suzhou River dredging project to the special committee for discussion.

<p>The Shanghai County Government received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs, stating that in order to comply with the law, the Provincial Government's Order No. 3368 stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued a consultation stating that foreigners traveling to the Chinese mainland should obtain passports. According to reports from various provinces, there are foreigners who travel without passports, which is very inappropriate. The Ministry has notified various embassies in China to stop this. In the future, in non-treaty ports, if there are foreigners arriving, the passport should be checked first. If there is no passport, the transit should be refused, and they should be escorted out of the country to avoid further complications. In addition to issuing separate consultations, it is appropriate to consult and request that all subordinates comply with the order. This order is hereby issued to the county magistrate to instruct his subordinates to comply with the order.</p>

<p>On the 15th, eighty-one students from the Japanese Fukuoka student tour group had a dispute with wounded soldiers in Suzhou over the competition for donkeys. The next day, Chinese and foreign newspapers reported on it. Yesterday, it was learned that after the Japanese Embassy Office and the Japanese Consulate received reports from the Japanese Consul Kawaminami stationed in Suzhou, they sent Vice-Consul Tanaka to investigate the truth. Yesterday, all the Japanese students had returned to Shanghai. The cause of the incident has also been clarified. Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu believes that this matter is only a local issue and there is no need to raise it through diplomatic channels. Yesterday, only Acting Consul-General Miura telegraphed the Japanese Consul Kawaminami stationed in Suzhou to contact the local county government to moderately compensate the injured students for medical expenses and lost items to resolve the matter. The tour group is scheduled to return to Japan from Shanghai on the 23rd.</p>

<p>The Sichuan Shipping Delegation Comes to Shanghai to Visit. The Sichuan River shipping industry is now planning to refresh its business and strive to compete with foreign ships. Therefore, the first step is to start with unity. Last year, there was a proposal for the joint operation of eleven companies in the upper reaches of the river. As a result, due to changes in the situation and multiple accidents, it was delayed. Now, the Sichuan River shipping merchants have organized a visiting delegation from Chongqing, led by Lu Zuofu. They have arrived in Shanghai. The purpose of this visit is to investigate the organization of various shipping companies in Shanghai in order to reform after returning to Chongqing. They are scheduled to start visiting the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other bureaus next week.</p>

<p>The situation of the China National Products United Department Store has been reported in this newspaper many times. It is now known that since the department store announced its opening in the newspaper, domestic manufacturers from this port and other ports have sent representatives to Shanghai to negotiate, and some have requested to reserve locations. However, the department store has limited space, and more than 100 manufacturers have already registered. Therefore, it is difficult to meet the requests of all parties. Experts have also been contacted regarding the entertainment and other departments to lease the space. As for the layout of the factory and the interior and exterior of the department store, Sun Xueni, who has experience, has been asked to design the layout to ensure that it is both beautiful and dignified. Therefore, the preparatory staff has been extremely busy these days to ensure that it can open as scheduled on July 1st.</p>

<p>First Meeting Today</p>
<p>The first preparatory meeting for the construction of the Lin Zexu Memorial Hall has been scheduled for the 12th of this month, and the following notice has been issued: In the past hundred years, imperialists have taken the means of plundering and annexing to attack weak nations in order to gain economic advantages, not hesitating to shed blood and destroy people. The most ruthless and cruel act is the opium trade. Since the import of opium, our country has become weak, the people have become poor, and the people's lives are not guaranteed. The poison has increased. On this Sixth Third Commemoration Day, how can we not shed tears when we remember the legacy of Lin Zexu? To continue the spirit of Lin Gong, there must be a permanent memorial. Shanghai is the place where China and foreign countries look forward to each other, and it is necessary to take the lead in promoting it. The Shanghai Sixth Third Commemoration Conference decided to build the Lin Gong Memorial Hall to commemorate the sages and encourage the future. The conference publicly elected the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Department, the Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Government, the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce, the China National Anti-Drug Association, the Lin Gong family, Mayor Zhang Yuejun, Comrade Chen Dezheng, Mr. Ma Xiangbo, Mr. Lin Xiang, Mr. Li Denghui, Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Dr. Zheng Yuxiu, Mr. Ye Huijun, and Mr. Wang Jingqi as preparatory members, and Wang Jingqi was appointed as the convener.

It is hereby decided to hold the first preparatory meeting at 3:00 PM on the 18th of this month (Wednesday) at the China National Anti-Drug Association Hall, No. 4 Hong Kong Road, Shanghai. Please be on time. The future of anti-drug is very promising. It is heard that all parties are extremely supportive of the construction of the Lin Gong Memorial Hall.</p>

<p>The Twenty-Sixth Committee Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangsu Temporary Relief Association held its twenty-sixth committee meeting in the rear building of Renji Hall. More than ten members attended, including Huang Boyu, Huang Hanzhi, Huang Ruisheng, Jiao Leshan, Zhu Bianchen, and Lu Shao Liu. Chairman Huang Boyu reported on the following items: (1) This week, we received 2,400 yuan in relief funds from Muyang and Liyang, respectively, and 500 yuan was designated to assist the porridge relief in Yancheng. (2) Director Zhu sent a letter forwarding two red silk plaques presented by the people of districts 1, 2, 3, and 6 of Xinghua. (3) 10,000 yuan in relief funds from Dongtai was previously requested from the Department of Finance, but no reply has been received. A telegram has been sent to expedite the allocation. (4) Number of relief funds received this week. Matters for discussion: (1) The flood disaster in Suqian is serious, and the bandit disaster is even more tragic. Mr. Hua Shulun has replied with a survey of the situation. Please provide relief as soon as possible. Recently, Mr. Xu Zhifu was publicly recommended by the county to come to the association to request relief. The association plans to allocate some relief funds and discuss with the Jisheng Association how to jointly handle the matter. The motion was approved that the relief work in Suqian be jointly handled with the Jisheng Association. As for the joint handling method, Chairman Huang Han will go to the Jisheng Association for negotiation. (2) Magistrate of Yixing County and Mr. Zhu Yueting telegraphed that 2,400 yuan in relief funds has been handed over in rice prices. If the association and the Jisheng Association send staff to check on the distribution of the funds, permission will be granted to return the funds immediately. A telegram has now been sent to urge Mr. Zhang Zhongkuan to come to the association as soon as possible and arrange to visit with friends today. The association and the Jisheng Association will each raise some relief funds. The motion was approved that the association will add 2,600 yuan to the 2,400 yuan, totaling 5,000 yuan, to jointly handle the matter with the Jisheng Association. The method will also be negotiated by Chairman Huang. (3) The disaster situation in Huangxu Town, Zhenjiang, is very serious. According to the Chamber of Commerce, the town only received 100 yuan from the province, which is far from enough. In addition to raising funds separately by Mr. Leng Yuqiu, it is proposed that the association allocate 500 yuan to provide some relief. The motion was approved to allocate the funds.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Tragic Situation of the Bandit Disaster in Boxian County <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Report from the Jisheng Association</p>
<p>The China Jisheng Association has recently received a telegram from Guo Wenche, Zhang Yingtao, Li Xiangding, and Li Xianyi, representatives of the disaster victims in Hao County, stating that in the winter of the Republic of China year 14, tens of thousands of bandits attacked Hao County and occupied it for more than twenty days, burning, killing, looting, and seizing without any humanity. Your association generously donated huge sums of money, and Mr. Liu Lingsheng, Mr. Wang Yixian, and others personally went to the disaster area to distribute relief and save countless lives. Last year, Huang Hui in Hao South incited chaos and looted houses, turning them into ruins. The people were half buried in ditches. This spring, the bandits returned to Hao and stationed tens of thousands of people, imposing exorbitant taxes and levies, leaving ten houses empty out of ten. Livestock was used for military purposes, farmers stopped farming, and the livelihood was cut off. As the war started, Hao City was besieged, firewood and food were exhausted, and bombs were flying, causing more horrific deaths and injuries than in the past. Now, the bandits in Hao County are besieged in the city, and the hungry soldiers are seizing food from the people. The people cannot escape and can only sit and wait for death. The tragedy of exchanging children and dissecting corpses is happening again. We beg you to generously donate huge sums of money to save lives, and we will not be able to await your orders. Since there is no clean land in Anhui Province, in addition to the association's previous relief efforts in Wu, Xuan, Chu and other counties, the association is now short of manpower and financial resources and is at a loss.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Pronouncement of Verdict in the Case of Serial Matricide <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Four Convicts, Zhang Wenqing and Others, Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>The Funds for Zhang Su's Coffin and Burial Are All Outstanding</p>
<p>Official Order to Recover and Manage the Confiscated Money</p>
<p>Zhang Wenqing, a woman from Huzhou residing at No. 762 Bian'de Road, colluded with Chen Hengcai, Yao Yonggui, and Gao Jintang to murder her stepmother, Zhang Su, aged 34, with a knife in her residence at approximately 6 p.m. on January 25th of this year, due to a dispute over inheritance. The case was investigated by Chinese Detective Lang Jintang and Western Detective Chief MacWhirter of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, who apprehended the four male and female suspects and handed them over to the court. After more than ten interrogations, the debate concluded last Tuesday, and the date for the verdict announcement was set. As reported in this newspaper yesterday, at 2:30 p.m. the police escorted the male and female convicts to the Third Criminal Division of the Special Court. Police lawyers Ru Baoyi and Wang Yaotang, as well as defense lawyers for the accused, were present in court awaiting instructions. At 2:30 p.m., Judge Wu Tingqi, the original trial judge, took the bench and began reading the main text: "Defendants Zhang Wenqing and Chen Hengcai, each found guilty of instigating murder, are each sentenced to death and deprived of civil rights indefinitely. Yao Yonggui and Gao Jintang, each found guilty of jointly conspiring to murder, are each sentenced to death and deprived of civil rights indefinitely. If dissatisfied, they may file an appeal within ten days. Witness Gong Chunfu's bail of 200 yuan is approved for return." The plaintiff's lawyer, Fan, stated that several hundred yuan had already been spent on funeral expenses for Zhang Su after her death, and all were outstanding. Therefore, he requested that the recovered banknotes and bank draft of 400 yuan be released first to settle the debts. There was also a bank draft for 2,000 taels, which could be transferred to the civil court for processing. Judge Wu then replied, "The case file contains Shanghai Day and Night Bank deposit slips for 400 yuan and banknotes totaling 45 yuan, which are approved to be handed over to Zhang Wenheng (i.e., the deceased's son) along with her uncle, Su Yaoting (i.e., Su Xiaoting), to obtain reliable shopkeepers as guarantors and temporarily collect the funds to cover the coffin and burial expenses of the late Zhang Su. A detailed list of the expenses should be submitted and attached to the file." After the verdict was announced, the four convicts were separately detained by the police pending execution after confirmation. This heinous case of familial betrayal is the first of its kind since Zhang Xin Sheng and is highly regarded by society. The police investigation was also very thorough, solving the case quickly without missing a single suspect. Prosecutor Ru Baoyi was particularly able to base his arguments on legal principles, repeatedly debating in each court hearing. Now that the perpetrators have been punished according to the law, the grievance of the deceased has been redressed. Therefore, the bereaved family is very grateful to the police for fulfilling their duties and upholding the law.</p>
<p>Huzhou Small Steamer</p>
<h3 id="e135">Robbery on the Yong'an Steamer <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Old Helmsman Dies a Tragic Death</p>
<p>All Passengers Robbed Clean</p>
<p>The Xin Yong'an steamer, a Huzhou-bound steamer of the Yong'an Steamship Company's Shanghai branch, located at No. 150 Shanxi Road, South Bank of the Pot Soup Alley Bridge in this city, was en route from Huzhou to Shanghai at around 3 p.m. the day before yesterday. As it was sailing in the Suzhou Creek, passing the Lihui area east of Luxu, it was suddenly surrounded by over a hundred bandits on both banks and in the water on three sides. They fired shots and ordered the ship to stop. The old helmsman, Huang Genxiang, seeing the bandits swarming like ants and being very fierce, dared not confront them. He immediately rang the bell to stop the engine and await orders. However, the bandits were very impatient and fired shots like rain. Huang Genxiang was suddenly struck in the head by a bullet while on the side of the ship. He immediately fell to the ground and died due to his injuries. The bandits then swarmed onto the ship and wantonly robbed all the passengers, over a hundred in total, without exception. The losses were estimated at around 6,000 gold yuan.</p>
<p>The Xin Yong'an steamer departed from Huzhou at 7 a.m. the day before yesterday, traveling slowly and arriving in Shanghai. At around 3 p.m., after passing Luxu and traveling east for about three li, the place was named Lihui. The distance from Huzhou to here was about 160 li. The distance from Lihui to Shanghai was also the same. This was about halfway. The waterway was very narrow, and the banks were close enough to call out to each other. Villagers were engaged in fishing, and many large nets were placed in the water. Small steamers passing through this area had to slow down for fear of obstructing the fishing nets. At that time, the Yong'an steamer was proceeding slowly when suddenly gunshots were heard from the shore, first sparse and then dense. The old helmsman, Huang Genxiang, was on the side of the ship, directing the steering. Hearing the sound, he knew something was wrong and quickly ordered the helmsman to stop the engine. However, in the rush, although the engine stopped, the forward momentum did not cease, and the ship continued to move forward with the remaining momentum. Moreover, the rattling sound of the engine came from the middle cabin, as if the ship was steaming forward. The bandits misunderstood and fired even more urgently, aiming their guns at the wheelhouse. A bullet flew and struck the old helmsman Huang Genxiang in the temple. He immediately fell to the ground with a thud, blood flowing from his forehead. He fainted and did not move, and the ship came to an abrupt stop.</p>
<p>The bandits, numbering over a hundred, swarmed onto the ship from small boats. They were armed with fierce weapons and quick-firing guns, and their voices sounded as if they came from Shandong province. The bandits wore various clothing, including blue cloth shirts and pants, and tattered military uniforms. Those who appeared to be leaders directed the crowd to rob in separate directions. Passengers on the Huzhou steamer were mostly wealthy merchants from various classes along the Suzhou Creek. The bandits targeted everyone, from first class to the canopy, and no one escaped. Everything, including money, clothes, jewelry, and luggage, was robbed by the bandits. Even the fruits carried by the passengers, such as peaches, were taken. If passengers were wearing silk shirts and pants, the bandits would exchange them for short blue cloth jackets and pants. The ship was robbed clean from bow to stern, and the commotion lasted for about an hour before the bandits carried away their loot and fled with a shout. The old helmsman, Huang Genxiang, was already barely breathing. He closed his eyes and died shortly after the bandits left the ship. He was sixty-three years old and an old helmsman.</p>
<p>The Yong'an steamer usually arrived in Shanghai at around 8 p.m. That night, it arrived about an hour and a half late. The company officials were worried and anxious. When the steamer docked, they learned the whole story of the ordeal. The passengers disembarked, all in a state of disarray, with incomplete clothing and without hats and shoes. Some even disembarked barefoot because the bandits had taken their satin shoes and leather boots. They searched everything, even the grass hats and felt hats. The purser on the ship temporarily claimed to be a tea servant to avoid disaster. After arriving in Shanghai, the passengers discussed how to deal with the aftermath. They did not return to their hometowns until yesterday, instead staying temporarily with relatives and friends in Shanghai. The damage to the ship itself was small, but there were three or four bullet holes in the wheelhouse, which was terrifying to see. According to those who traveled on the ship, the Yong'an steamer had been targeted by bandits three days earlier when it departed from Shanghai to Luxu, but fortunately, it steamed away and was not detained. Perhaps the bandits knew that Huzhou was a wealthy area and that merchants traveling to Shanghai would carry a lot of money, so robbing them would be profitable. However, it is tragic that an old helmsman in his sixties died a violent death.</p>
<p>Zhu Jixing Arrested</p>
<h3 id="e136">Yesterday's Court Interrogation <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Admits to Embezzling Huge Sums</p>
<p>Due to Losses in the Sugar Trade</p>
<p>Intended to Repay After Fleeing</p>
<p>But Credit Was Lost</p>
<p>Zhu Jixing from Zhenhai was a deputy comprador at the British-owned Jardine Matheson Bank and also opened the Yuan Xingde Sugar Firm, incurring significant losses in the sterling exchange business. He engaged in various fraudulent activities, embezzling over 160,000 yuan from the bank. Unable to cover the losses, he absconded without a trace. The bank reported the matter to the police station, which issued a warrant for his arrest and offered a reward of 2,000 yuan. Since Zhu's escape, two Ningbo natives, Xie Tonghou and Yu Xilin, who were accountants at Jardine Matheson Bank, were suspected by the bank's Western staff of colluding in the fraud. The bank filed a lawsuit against them, and Chief Judge Xu Jiashi of the Special District Court opened the trial several times, ordering Xie and Yu to each post a bail of 30,000 yuan. The case was rescheduled for further hearing on the morning of the 21st of this month.</p>
<p>Circumstances of Zhu Jixing's Arrest At 2:40 p.m. on the afternoon of the day, Chinese detective Zhang Guisheng of the Avenue Foch Police Station received a tip that Zhu was hiding in the attic room of No. 1281 Xiang'an Lane, Seward Road. Detective Zhang, together with a Western detective, took the arrest warrant and proceeded to arrest him. Zhu was lying in bed when the detectives arrived. After examining him and confirming that his appearance matched the description on the arrest warrant, they arrested him and took him back to the police station. Because the case was being investigated by the General Police Station, he was transferred to that station for detention.</p>
<p>The police charged him with two crimes. Yesterday morning at 9 a.m., Chinese detective Fei Kelun escorted Zhu to the First Criminal Division of the Special Court, where Chief Judge Xu Jiashi and Chief Prosecutor Zhou Xianjue took the bench for interrogation. Gan Jingxian, the lawyer representing the police, stated that the police were prosecuting him under Articles 357 (embezzlement) and 224 (forgery) of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>The Method of Altering Numbers Zhu altered the numbers on deposit slips made by others. His method was to change a deposit of 20,000 silver dollars made by Bao Feng Qian Zhuang into 2,000 on the receipt, get it signed by the Western staff, and then add a "0" after the "2000" in the English text, making it 20,000 again, and give it to the Qian Zhuang's partner. In this way, he embezzled 18,000 yuan. Similarly, 30,000 yuan was changed to 3,000 yuan. In total, there were eight deposit slips with altered numbers. However, before fleeing, when the Qian Zhuang came to redeem the deposits, Zhu managed to pay them back in full. The bank had to pay what was not repaid, incurring significant losses. Today, a representative from Jardine Matheson Bank is also present to testify.</p>
<p>Statement of Jardine Matheson's Representative Zhu Jixing's lawyer, Jiang Baoli, stated that he and lawyer Jiang Yiping jointly represented the defendant. According to the police, this case should be combined with the case of Xie Tonghou, so today's hearing must be postponed because they have not yet met with the client. Judge Xu stated that he needed to ask about the forgery of documents and summoned Hesituo, the representative of Jardine Matheson Bank, to the stand. Hesituo's statement about the alteration of tickets was largely the same as that of lawyer Gan, and he stated that the defendant had forged a total of 39 bank drafts, totaling 161,713 taels and 7 qian and 9 fen, and submitted the bank drafts as evidence.</p>
<p>Record of Zhu Jixing's Testimony Judge Xu reviewed the bank drafts and read out each date and amount, one by one. Zhu nodded repeatedly, saying that there were no errors. He also confessed that he had been with Jardine Matheson for fifteen years, starting as a deputy runner, then promoted to full runner, and then to his current position. His embezzlement of large sums was due to losses in the sugar trade and the large sums he had to pay as a guarantor. Last year, he used empty money for up to 256,000 yuan. On May 20th of this year, he paid the bank 37,000 taels of silver and 10,000 yuan in foreign currency. On the 21st, he paid another 4,000 taels of silver and 4,000 yuan in foreign currency. After his escape, he intended to repay within ten days, but the matter was published in various newspapers, causing his credit to be completely lost and making it impossible to raise funds. The alteration of the receipts was done using a type of medicine sold by the Commercial Press.</p>
<p>Chief Comprador Testifies Ling Pengji, the chief comprador of Jardine Matheson Bank, testified that he saw Zhu Jixing hand over 10,000 yuan to the bank at the time, but did not know the details of the rest. After reviewing the testimony, Judge Xu adjourned the case to be combined with the Xie case, and Zhu Jixing was remanded in custody.</p>
<p>The Forged Bank Draft Case Continuing the hearing on the case related to Zhu, Zheng Hekang, a partner in Zhu Jixing's Deji Sugar Firm, was accused of using forged bank drafts. On the 21st of last month, Zhu Jixing and his brother, Jiming, instructed Zheng to deposit a bank draft from Yifeng Qian Zhuang for 52,116 taels, 7 qian, and 6 fen into the Siming Bank. However, the bank discovered that the draft was forged and reported it to the General Police Station, which ordered detective Zhou Xiaozhi to detain Zheng and hand him over to the Special District Court. Zheng hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him, arguing that the defendant was acting on the orders of his employer and did not know that the draft was forged. The court adjourned the hearing and ordered Zheng to post a bail of 300 yuan. The details of this case were reported in this newspaper.</p>
<p>Zheng Hekang Granted Release Yesterday morning, Judge Xu questioned Zheng, who testified that Zhu Jixing gave him the draft. Judge Xu then ordered Zhu Jixing to stand in the witness box. Zhu readily admitted it. Lawyer Fan Gang immediately stated that Zhu Jixing's confession proved that the defendant Zheng Hekang was unaware of the forgery, and requested his release. The police lawyer Gan Jingxian also stated that since the defendant was unaware of the forgery, he should be released and the police should file a separate charge against Zhu Jixing. Judge Xu then declared him not guilty and cancelled his bail.</p>
<p>Haunted by His Former Wife</p>

<p>Wife's Solicitude for Her Children at the Time of Death</p>
<p>Insistent Instructions Never to Remarry</p>
<p>Breach of Promise by Remarrying Only Six Mornings</p>
<p>Causing Painful Abdominal Rupture</p>
<p>Zhang Guisheng, a 43-year-old man from Jiangbei, worked as a laborer at the Samsung Yarn Factory in Yangshupu and rented a room near Workshop No. 88. At around 5 a.m. yesterday morning, he used a razor to cut open his abdomen, removing his internal organs and causing blood to flow into a stream. Initially, his wife suspected that he was wetting the bed, but then she smelled blood and knew something was wrong. She rushed forward and saw Zhang's abdomen covered in blood, a horrific sight. She was shocked and immediately ordered her daughter to report to the police station. The Chinese police from No. 226 arrived and transported him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, according to Zhang, his first wife had passed away six years ago and had given birth to a son and a daughter. The eldest daughter, named Gendi, is now fifteen years old, and the son, named Liusesizi, is eleven years old. When his deceased wife was seriously ill, she had said to Zhang, "If I die, you don't need to remarry. I have already given you children. If you remarry, my children will undoubtedly suffer abuse from your stepmother. If you break this promise, I will make you uneasy in the afterlife." At that time, he had promised her wholeheartedly, and his wife had passed away with a smile. For six years, all was well. Last month, through the kindness of a friend, he introduced Zheng, a young woman from his hometown, to be his wife. She was 32 years old. Only six mornings after she entered the door, this tragic incident occurred. In reality, it was caused by his former wife in a dream. He did not feel any pain when he cut open his abdomen.</p>

<p>Japanese Person Leaves Behind Banknotes</p>
<p>Amounting to Approximately Two Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>At approximately 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, a Japanese person from a certain yarn factory was carrying a package of banknotes, approximately 2,000 yuan in foreign currency, intended for paying wages. Due to a hurried exit from the public bus on the Jing'an Temple to Bazichang route of the Public Bus Company of the Public Concession, he left the banknotes in the vehicle. A certain ticket seller noticed the large sum of cash and immediately reported it to the ticket inspector. The ticket inspector sent the banknotes to the company. Before long, the Japanese person went to the company to report the loss, and after verifying that the amount matched, he completed the procedures and retrieved it. Subsequently, the Japanese person gave the ticket inspector and the ticket seller several yuan in foreign currency as a reward. Such a ticket seller can be said to be honest.</p>

<p>Farewell Banquet for Mr. Grien Departing for His Home Country</p>
<p>Welcome Reception for Mr. Harvard Arriving in China</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Mr. Grien, editor of the North-China Daily News, will return to England on the 21st of this month. Feng Bingnan gathered prominent figures from the business and media sectors at his private residence last night at 7 p.m. to hold a farewell banquet for him, while also welcoming Mr. Harvard, the successor to the newspaper's editorship, to attend. Among those present were Yu Qiaqing, Rong Desheng, Lu Bohong, Qin Runqing, Zhang Zhuping, Wang Yingbin, Xiong Shaohao, Li Haoran, Wang Zhongwei, Yan Duhe, as well as Western merchants, totaling more than thirty people. During the event, Mr. Feng rose to deliver a farewell speech, stating that Mr. Grien had been in charge of the North-China Daily News for more than ten years. Although his views and opinions on various Chinese issues may not have been entirely agreed upon, his intentions were quite sincere. In the past, there were many misunderstandings between China and the West. In recent years, they have gradually approached each other and there is a growing understanding. The world advocates mutual assistance between China and foreign countries, which is easy to talk about but difficult to implement. To achieve true mutual assistance, it is necessary to seek mutual understanding. To seek understanding, it is necessary to meet and exchange opinions with each other from time to time. Tonight, we have specially invited Chinese and Western media to gather together. On the one hand, we bid farewell to Mr. Grien, hoping that he will share his experiences in China over the past ten years with his countrymen, which will not only benefit his countrymen but also promote the glory of China. On the other hand, we welcome Mr. Harvard to succeed Mr. Grien as editor of the newspaper. He will surely promote the goodwill between Chinese and foreign people with a spirit of mutual assistance. Mr. Harvard has been running newspapers in India for more than twenty years. Two years ago, he was summoned back to England to serve in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This year, he is in charge of the North-China Daily News in China. He will surely use the skills of a statesman to benefit the friendship between China and foreign countries. Mr. Feng also composed a poem to present to Mr. Grien: "Who can carry the large pen? A literary giant holds a strong talent. The work is troublesome and difficult, but he can master it. The dangerous and suspicious shocks the demons. The opinions of the people are numerous and immeasurable. His electric eyes brightly illuminate the walls. He uses a model to first enclose the world. All things follow the round and square. Weighing wisdom is unparalleled. He can expand his duties and expand his words loudly. He can also evaluate people's shortcomings, whether beautiful or derogatory, it should be. Your opinion and my opinion may differ. What does it matter? The purpose is magnificent to each other. You are always busy for the public, seeking their welfare and auspiciousness. We lived together in Shanghai like duckweed, exhausting our efforts to protect and shield, ensuring that the fragile and precarious reaches Kangzhuang. Sometimes the path is dark and confused, and there are no lights to guide or mislead. But I believe you will never forget to be single-minded and not blind. Why do I trust you firmly? Because I wrote an article for you at that time. You can have confidence and sincerity. I hope you can still help my country. I hope you can still express your heart. You board the ship high and float across the ocean. The good feelings of friends are carried along. Just like the setting sun, the infinite good scenery is beyond the morning light. Your writing is fast and sincere. You can seek peace and prosperity for our country. You can seek welfare for our country. The benefits are great, and I will always hope for it."</p>
<p>Mr. Grien's reply mainly stated that the weekly publication of the North-China Daily News has been established for eighty years, and the North-China Daily News has a history of sixty years. He has only been in charge of the editorship for nineteen and a half years. Speaking of the long history of the North-China Daily News, nineteen years is just a blink of an eye. As Mr. Feng said, not everyone necessarily agrees with my opinions and propositions, and everyone has faults, how can I not? But I deeply believe that what I have written has all been sincere. A Western proverb says that sincerity is most likely to lead people to hell. As for this saying, I believe that my opinion will not lead people to prison and I deeply believe that it will not lead its readers to hell. He also said that he also had a penchant for poetry when he was young, but no one gave him poetry throughout his life. Now that he has received Mr. Feng's poem, he will cherish it as a treasure.

<h3 id="e140">Inspecting Licensed Rickshaws <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, in order to rectify the city's transportation vehicles, regularly inspects and urges the repair of the licensed rickshaws, which are the most numerous and frequently used. Originally, the plan was to inspect them in rotation four times a year, but after the Municipal Government approved, it was changed to three times. The first phase of inspection, which began in March of this year and lasted until the end of June, has already been completed. The second phase of inspection is scheduled to begin on July 1st and last until the end of September, which is not far away. It is now learned that the Bureau has, as usual, sent the vehicle inspection notification forms to the Shanghai Commercial Association Rickshaw Industry Branch and the North Shanghai Rickshaw Merchants Association, ordering them to properly allocate the inspection dates for each vehicle, fill them out, and forward them to the respective donation payers, informing the car dealers to go for inspection on time.</p>

<p>Visitors Still Very Crowded</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third day after the opening of the Public Art Exhibition. Because the inner garden was not open to the public, visitors often could not find a shortcut, so starting yesterday, in addition to the markers set around the City God Temple, bamboo cloths were also placed on the front and rear thoroughfares to draw attention. Yesterday, there were still more than 1,600 visitors, including ordinary people as well as collectors and artists, but there were fewer students, presumably because they were taking exams during the day. Director Pan of the Social Bureau also visited the exhibition in the afternoon. Before leaving, Mr. Chen, the resident promoter of Hanli Company, asked him to inscribe a few words for the Zhongling printing machine. Director Pan immediately wrote "A Good Tool for Popularizing Art" and presented it. The company completed the plate making and printing completely within five minutes, and the font was very similar to ink and the color was uniform. The viewers were amazed by the speed and even placed orders on the spot.</p>

<p>Film Advertisements Must Indicate "Inspected"</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Film Inspection Committee, it has been closely reviewing films in this city. Film merchants have also learned from the experience of the Great Light Cinema, so any new film must be submitted to the committee for inspection in advance to avoid disputes. Last week, there was news of a temporary suspension of inspections, and theaters in the concessions inquired about the matter with the committee. After the committee published a correction in the newspaper, they finally understood the truth. However, most of the film advertisements in Shen Xin two newspapers in recent days have not indicated "Inspected." The committee also made no indication. Yesterday, a reporter from Guomin News visited Chen Duanzhi, a member of the committee. According to him, the failure of the theaters' advertisements to indicate "Inspected" in recent days may be due to a misprint in a certain newspaper last week about a temporary suspension of inspections. However, the work of the committee has not stopped. It is now separately notifying the theaters to correct the error immediately. If there is any intentional delay, it should still be dealt with according to the regulations. It is also learned that the committee plans to compile and publish the details of the past year's work and the inspection catalog at the end of the year.</p>

<p>In the New Shanghai Hotel</p>
<p>Eight Robbers Apprehended One After Another</p>
<p>At 2:30 p.m. yesterday, the Huishi Police Station of the Public Concession received a confidential report that a large number of bandits who had committed major crimes were hiding in Room 33 of the New Shanghai Hotel, No. 249 Jiu'an Lane, Wuma Road. After receiving the report, the police chief immediately ordered six Chinese and Western detectives to secretly proceed to the hideout with weapons. When the detectives entered the room, they saw four or five people inside talking and laughing enthusiastically. Upon seeing the detectives arrive, they panicked. One of the detectives told them to raise their hands. However, one person was slow to raise his hands and tried to reach into his pocket as if to retrieve something. To preemptively strike, the detectives fired two shots, hitting the robber in the right waist, causing him to fall to the ground. The other robbers were also apprehended and taken to the police station. The injured robber was sent to the Municipal Council Hospital by a Western police vehicle for treatment. To eliminate the bandits, the police chief dispatched several detectives to guard the hotel for several hours, and three or four more people were apprehended one after another, totaling eight people. Among them was a female bandit named Zhou, who was about twenty years old. She was transferred to the Special District Court for investigation this morning. According to reports, on the 11th, a local person named Xia Jinsheng, 32 years old, brought Zhou to open Room 33.

<p>Wang Shifu and Su Shenggao, the Zhabei leaders of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's detective team, and Wan Shengri suddenly received a confidential report that the robbers who robbed Zhang Changfa's home at No. 13 Lu Family Zhai, Zhongxing Road, in the fifth district's jurisdiction on March 27th of this year were hiding in the Wang Family Zhai area of Zhabei. They were asked to send personnel to arrest them as soon as possible. After hearing the report, Wang and Su immediately took detectives Ying Defa, Liu Yongfu, Wang Yaogao, Ju Chuan, Lü Xingchun, and Mai Yulin. They originally intended to go together with the district police chief in charge, but just as the detectives arrived at Wang Family Zhai, they received another report that the robbers were currently eating tea at the Dexin Tea House on Mind Road. The detectives, in light of the urgency of the situation, deeply concerned that the robbers might escape upon hearing the news, immediately joined forces with the nearby patrol police to apprehend Song Yongsen and Ma Afu. They then continued to apprehend Chen Aming, Zhang Ada, and Zhang Guixing on Qiujiang Road, bringing them all to the Second Sub-Bureau of the Fifth District for direct transfer to the bureau. They were then transferred to the Judicial Section for investigation by the detective team. Ma Afu and Zhang Ada both directly admitted to the robbery of the Zhang family without hesitation. Zhang Guixing, Song Yongsen, and Chen Aming all denied the robbery slyly. Just as they were being interrogated, detectives Ying Defa and Liu Yongfu discovered that an accomplice, Sun Xingyao, was hiding in a western-style house at No. 3 opposite the Yong'an Company warehouse on Yongxing Road. They joined forces with the chief police officer of the Second Sub-Bureau of the Fifth District to rush to arrest him. However, Sun attempted to escape by jumping out of the window, causing him to injure his left foot and be captured on the spot. They took him to the police station for strict interrogation and also seized stolen goods such as gray squirrel and cat fur robes from the Xingchang Pawnshop on Haining Road, ordering the victims to identify them without error.

Their marriage had lasted four years, but they were constantly at odds, their quarrels a common sound.  Zhuang had recently been working at the Hengchangxiang Machinery Factory in Pudong. Yesterday, at 5 p.m. after work, he took a ferry back to Shanghai. As the boat approached the China Merchants Bureau wharf, Zhuang, eager to disembark, jumped onto the pier.  However, due to the height difference, he lost his footing and fell into the river. At that moment, the Jiangtian steamship passed by, its waves violently churning the water, sweeping Zhuang away without a trace.

<p>Zhou Wanzhen, a woman from Changzhou who resides at number 80, south of Haichao Temple, Lujiabang, Shanghai, is a beautiful, fashionably dressed woman in her early twenties. In March of last year, through a matchmaker, she was betrothed to Shen Wenbin. A betrothal gift of one thousand yuan was received.  Their wedding date was set for the 9th day of the 9th lunar month of this year. Shen, a native of this place, is 24 years old and studying medicine under the famous doctor Shen Zhuoru. Recently, Zhou hired a lawyer and filed a petition with the Special District Court, requesting permission to dissolve her marriage with Shen Wenbin.  Her reason was that at the time of the engagement, she was in her hometown of Wujin and the decision was made entirely by her parents without her consent.  When she returned to Shanghai and learned of the matter, she immediately stated her unwillingness. However, the Shen family deliberately advanced the wedding date, which was not her desire.  The court accepted the petition and issued a summons for both parties. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Yi presided over the hearing in the Tenth Civil Court. The defendant, Shen Wenbin, was represented by lawyer Shen Qi.  The plaintiff, Zhou Wanzhen, submitted her complaint, stating the aforementioned circumstances and requesting permission to dissolve the marriage. Then, the defendant's lawyer, Shen, stated that the case began with the plaintiff's lawyer sending a letter to his client requesting dissolution.  The defendant then commissioned this lawyer to reply, agreeing to the dissolution but requiring the return of the one thousand yuan betrothal gift.  The plaintiff's side stated that the betrothal gift was received by her parents and should be recovered from them.  Later, last month, another letter was received from the plaintiff's lawyer agreeing to return the betrothal gift but requesting a slight delay.  How could they send a letter on one hand and then file a lawsuit in the court on the other? This is truly strange.  Now, the defendant's side, due to the plaintiff's actions, must file a counterclaim requesting confirmation of the validity of the marriage.  Judge Yang, after reviewing the evidence and questioning the defendant Shen Wenbin, stated that both parties had an early intention to reconcile and there was no need for litigation.  Since the plaintiff wished to dissolve the marriage, the betrothal gift should be returned. The plaintiff's lawyer then requested to withdraw the lawsuit, which the court granted.</p>

<p>Gu Yin Feng, a woman from Suzhou, is currently 21 years old.  Previously, she was a prostitute in a brothel on East Xinqiao, French Concession.  In July of the year before last, Xin Chunli, a tailor from Ningbo and the owner of Fachang Hongbang Tailor Shop at 931 and a half Broadway Road, frequented the brothel. He fell in love with Gu at first sight, and after much affection, they made a promise to be together forever. Xin paid to redeem Gu from prostitution and took her as his concubine.  They lived together for two years.  Recently, disagreements arose, and Gu hired lawyer E Sen to file a petition with the District Court, requesting to dissolve her relationship with Xin and demanding the return of her clothing and belongings.  Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Yi presided over the Tenth Civil Court. The plaintiff, Gu Yin Feng, stated that after marrying the defendant as a concubine, she lived with his first wife and suffered abuse. Therefore, in November of last year, she left. The defendant then invited many gangsters to come and cause trouble.  She does not want to return and requests permission to leave and to recover her clothing and belongings.  The defendant, Xin Chunli, stated that when the plaintiff was a prostitute, she was being abused by the evil madam, so he paid to redeem her and they lived together. Now that the plaintiff wants to leave, he is willing, but the clothing and belongings belong to him and cannot be returned. Judge Yang, with both parties willing to separate, suggested trying to reconcile and advised the defendant to return several items of the plaintiff's clothing.  The defendant agreed, and a reconciliation was reached. The court clerk prepared a settlement document, which was signed by both parties and their lawyers, concluding the case.</p>

<p>Dai Zhaodi Leaves Father to Find Husband</p>
<p>Dai Zhaodi (20 years old), a Ningbo woman residing at 1143 Zhengzhou Road, Hongkou, is of good appearance and works in a spinning factory. She has not yet been married. She fell in love with Wang Ayou, a copper worker from Shaoxing who works at the same factory (25 years old, residing at No. 8, Chengan Lane, Dalian Bay Road). Their secret affair has happened more than once. They secretly made a promise to be together forever. Wang had asked a matchmaker to propose to the girl's father, but the girl's father disliked that Wang had no property and did not want his beloved daughter to marry a poor man, so he sternly refused. Zhaodi, hot with love, secretly arranged to elope with her lover to Pudong and rent a house to live together. Within a few days, she was found by her father. At that time, Wang had gone out to work. Her father only took Zhaodi back and severely rebuked her. But Zhaodi ran away again after four days at home. She found Wang Ayou on Xinmin Road in Zhabei and asked him to find another place for them to live. Wang, timid and afraid of trouble, was evasive. Zhaodi was furious when she heard this, accusing Wang of being unfaithful and forgetting their love. She then dragged him to the Fourth District, First Precinct, requesting their help to fulfill her wishes. Director Yao, regarding the case as concerning marriage and the girl's father living in the concession, transferred it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation yesterday after repeated mediation.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local Chinese Telegraph Bureau learned that a telegraph line had broken between Baoshan Road and the North Railway Station. At that time, the bureau only had two craftsmen, which was insufficient. They urgently used the telephone to notify the South City Telephone Bureau to dispatch two workers. At around 1 p.m., the four met at the destination to carry out repairs. A worker surnamed He took down a bottle of methylated spirit and placed it into a spray can, but the opening was small and it was difficult to pour into the can, causing a lot of the methylated spirit to spill onto the ground. Afterwards, someone threw a cigarette butt on the ground. The methylated spirit was highly flammable, causing a fire. The four workers were all burned. One worker surnamed Sheng had his head and face burned and was seriously injured. The others suffered minor skin burns on their hands and faces. They were all taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment by ambulance. Their names are listed below: Sheng Yuru, 31 years old, from Pudong. Xu Renkai, 22 years old, same as above. The above two are workers from the South City Telephone Bureau. He Xiangfa, 30 years old, from Jiaxing. Tan Mingsheng, 53 years old, from Jiangwan.

<p>Xiao Zhihe Sued for Loan</p>
<p>Xiao Chaoshi Implicated as Guarantor</p>
<p>Du Runsheng, represented by a lawyer, filed a lawsuit in the French Court, stating that in 1925, Xiao Zhihe borrowed 800 taels of silver from the plaintiff. At that time, Xiao Chaoshi, the owner of Yuanshun Pawnshop, guaranteed the loan. The loan agreement stated a term of six months. Afterwards, upon the expiration of the term, the debtor Xiao Zhihe was unable to repay the loan. The plaintiff has been giving him time to repay the loan until now, for six years, without receiving any payment. Moreover, the debtor has disappeared. The plaintiff requests permission to seek recovery from the guarantor. The defendant guarantor, Xiao Chaoshi, was also represented by a lawyer who argued that the loan agreement stated that the guarantor guaranteed the loan for a term of six months. Afterwards, the debtor repeatedly extended the term to the plaintiff, without notifying the guarantor. Now, six years have passed. According to civil law, since the term has expired, the guarantor is relieved of the responsibility of guaranteeing the loan. Furthermore, recently, the lawyer has also had a similar case representing a guarantor who was sued in the District Court and was dismissed by the court. He presented the judgment to the court for review. The plaintiff's lawyer argued for a long time. Judge Gong ordered that a date be set for the judgment to be announced.</p>

<p>After the collapse of Renhe and Hongyu Huiyu Hardware Stores on Catholic Church Street in the French Concession, the owner, He Gengxing, fled without a trace. Afterwards, it was found that the two stores owed more than one million yuan in debt. Banks and qianzhuang were owed more than 200,000 taels. Creditors such as Renheng, Henglai, Hengli, and Zhengda reported to the Qianye Gonghui, requesting that it forward a letter to the French Concession to oppose the appointment of a liquidator. The Shanghai Qianye Gonghui's letter to French Court Judge Gong yesterday is recorded below: Respectfully informing you that we recently received a joint letter from our fellow Qianzhuang, Renheng, Henglai, Yichang, Zhicheng, Henglong, Chengyu, Xinfu, Tongyu, Hengyu, Jiufeng, and Hengli and Zhengda Banks, stating that they had dealings with the Renhe and Hongyu Huiyu Hardware Stores on Catholic Church Street in the French Concession, amounting to more than 200,000 taels. The owner of the two stores, He Gengxing, recently absconded with the funds, and the two stores collapsed simultaneously. The direct losses suffered by the Qianzhuang are already so great, and the indirect impacts are even greater. Unexpectedly, after absconding with the funds, He Gengxing instigated others to falsely request the French Concession to order an accountant to carry out liquidation, which is obviously an illegal act to infringe upon the rights of the Qianzhuang creditors. As the Qianzhuang industry relates to Shanghai's finances, it should be protected according to law. The sudden collapse of Renhe and Hongyu Huiyu is a special circumstance and must be given special attention. We respectfully request that your court revoke the illegal liquidation procedures and strictly arrest He Gengxing, the owner of Renhe and Hongyu Huiyu, to investigate him and maintain financial security. The Qianzhuang Association has received this request and has determined that our fellow Qianzhuang, Renheng, and others have suffered greatly from the collapse of Renhe and Hongyu Huiyu. If their rights are harmed again, the impact will inevitably affect the overall financial situation. Therefore, we report this matter to you and request that your court immediately revoke the liquidation procedures for Renhe and Hongyu Huiyu and strictly arrest He Gengxing, the owner of the two stores, to investigate him and maintain financial security. This is a matter of public interest. Respectfully addressed to Judge Gong, French Concession. Shanghai Qianye Gonghui.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday morning, a fashionable woman intended to commit suicide near the Jinliyuan Wharf. She was rescued by a Chinese police officer from the water patrol and taken to the police station. The woman did not want to reveal the truth. Later, the police chief discovered that the woman had stayed overnight at the Shenzhou Hotel and had deposited all her luggage there, obtaining a luggage receipt which she had mailed to her brother to collect it from the hotel. She was then transferred to the District Court for disposition. Yesterday's report carried the story. It is now known that the prosecutor of the court has examined the case. She initially claimed to be named Zhu Yi Wu, 21 years old, from Nanjing, and unmarried. She then denied the truth of the name she had given. As for her language, the judge believed she had a Sichuan accent, so he asked her if her hometown was Sichuan. She said that she had lived in Sichuan for several years. She had also been to major commercial ports such as Nanjing, Beijing, and Shanghai. The judge, unable to elicit the truth after repeated questioning, ordered that she be temporarily detained in the nursing home pending investigation to allow relatives to identify her and reunite them.</p>

I and my wife then lived in the defendant's house. The money I earned was also given to the defendant, as he is no different from my own son. Now, he suddenly wants to force me to move out, so I demand that he be punished for despising his elders." The defendant, 31 years old and from Changzhou, who works as a tailor, stated, "The plaintiff is my father-in-law. Today, he drank too much and falsely accused me of having an affair with my mother-in-law and beat me severely. I am truly wronged." Director Zhang, with the father-in-law and son-in-law being at odds, ordered them to live separately to avoid quarrels.</p>

After being questioned by District Officer Xu, the girl, Dong Dongmei, 15 years old and from Xiashi, living near the Guandi Temple in the West Gate of Shanghai, stated, "The night before last, I was standing in front of my house, looking around, when the man who was arrested walked up to me and patted me on the back several times. I immediately became dizzy and lost consciousness. I followed him to a small inn on Adora Road and stayed overnight. The day before yesterday afternoon, I took the train to Wusong and stood on the shore, waiting for the Chongming ship to arrive so I could take it to..."

<p>At around 12 p.m. yesterday, a young man of about 20 years old in a Western suit, extremely handsome, went to the Southeast Medical University near the Shanghai Military Camp in the South Wharf and claimed to be visiting Liu Yumei, a Taiwanese student at the school. At that time, all the students in the school were at lunch. The school employee asked him to wait and went inside to notify her. The young man took the opportunity to sneak into the dormitory room of Zhang Xingru, a student from Jiangyin, and secretly took a fountain pen and a Western-style tie hanging on the wall that were placed on the desk. Fearing that he would be discovered, he immediately walked out. However, Zhang had finished his meal and returned, encountering a stranger hurrying out of his dormitory room. Knowing that he was not a good person, he shouted "Thief!" and all the students in the dining hall stopped eating and rushed forward to investigate. Zhang had already grabbed the man and found the stolen goods on his body. He immediately reported it to the security guard Tian Weiqing of the 21st Post and took him back to the First District First Precinct where he was apprehended by the precinct officer. The young man gave his name as Cao, 19 years old, from Suzhou, currently residing on Avenue du Père Robert in the French Concession and working as a clerk in a porcelain factory. He also stated, "My father is currently a teacher in a famous university in Shanghai," and admitted that he had stolen out of petty greed. Regarding the matter as a theft case, he was ordered to prepare a document and send it to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>At around 10 a.m. yesterday, four thugs came to 589 Yunnan Road, Public Concession, Yunnan Road. Three of them took out pistols and threatened the owner, confining him to a room. One thief stood guard outside the door, while the others went upstairs and rummaged through boxes and chests, stealing gold jewelry, clothing, and cash totaling 1,038 yuan.</p>
<p>At around 10:50 a.m. yesterday, a passerby was walking along a lane on Hubei Road when two thugs stopped him and stole 55 yuan from his pocket. The robbers then fled with the stolen goods. The victim reported the incident to the police station, requesting that they be apprehended.</p>
<p>At around 11 p.m. last night, three thieves came to the Yongchangxiang South Goods Store at 866 and 868 Boulevard Freluchon in the French Concession under the pretext of shopping. They forced open the gate and broke in. Two of them held pistols and prevented anyone from making noise. They stole 31-32 yuan from the cashier's counter and fled.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Datong Music Society Adds Summer Classes <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Datong Music Society on Songshan Road in the French Concession has initiated the study of the highest national music (Zhonghe Shaoyue). Last Sunday, the society formally practiced the music, and the results were excellent. The music has six movements: (1) Taihe Chapter, promoting the harmony of heaven and earth; (2) Xiehe Chapter, promoting the meaning of peace; (3) Tonghe Chapter, promoting the meaning of common peace; (4) Baohe Chapter, maintaining the meaning of peace; (5) Jihe Chapter, the meaning of permanent peace; (6) Xianghe Chapter, the meaning of being full of happiness. The musical instruments used are complete in all eight tones, and each team member can earnestly study. They will be able to give a public performance in about a month, making the highest national music of five thousand years come alive in the world. Isn't this a great event? It is also heard that because the summer vacation is approaching, many students from various schools are coming to the society to learn various national musical instruments, so the society has decided to open summer classes, divided into Qin, Se, Pipa, Silk Bamboo, and Beijing Opera systems. Using the simplest teaching methods, they will strive to ensure that each student gains something during the summer vacation (50 days). After the summer vacation, those with appropriate qualifications can join the society's large orchestra as formal members, and they can learn any musical instrument or piece of music for free, as a way to provide preferential treatment and cultivate more talent for national music.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Recent News of Miss Yeh Hua, Detained by the Fujian Authorities <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Originally, joy and sorrow, separation and reunion, occurred on the evening of January 6th. Lin Zhiyuan, Chen Naiyuan, Zheng Baojing, Cheng Shigui, Xu Xianshi, members of the Fujian Provincial Government, and Wu Shu, head of the Water Police Bureau, were detained by Lu's troops under the charge of being reactionary. The first three were sent to Yanping, and the latter three were escorted to Youxi. Great officials, who previously gathered day and night to discuss provincial affairs intimately, were thus forced to sing a farewell song. On April 6th, the six reunited, all confined in Hongshan Bridge, only eight miles away from the provincial capital. Soon, Commander Liu's troops arrived in Fuzhou, and the six were again imprisoned in Youxi. News of fortune and misfortune arrived frequently, and everyone was constantly surprised and delighted. It is said that comrades seek each other out, and those suffering from the same ailment sympathize with each other. However, comrades may sometimes not seek each other out, but those suffering from the same ailment always sympathize. These six individuals were both comrades and suffering from the same ailment; outsiders cannot know the feelings they experienced.</p>
<p>Lin and the others' meals and expenses are all the responsibility of Lu's troops. It is said they are treated well. The day after their detention, each was given one hundred yuan for visiting bamboo forests and smoking cigarettes. Meals cost three yuan per person per day, and although Fujian goods are expensive, this is enough for two meals of major dishes. However, it is not known how the Lin party felt when eating. According to those who know, Chen and Xu spend their days reading and practicing calligraphy, feeling quite at ease. They once said to others, "Gaining adversity in life can be beneficial for self-cultivation and career, so we are broad-minded." Hearing this is comforting, but thinking about it is very painful.</p>
<p>The news of life and death is certain. On the 9th of this month, various newspapers reported the news of Lin, Chen, and Cheng being killed. In fact, Lin Zhiyuan, Chen Naiyuan, and Xu Xianshi were beheaded in Yanping, while Cheng Shigui is still safe and sound. This was transmitted in a private telegram. Cheng's nephew, Ganhou, who returned from Fujian yesterday, also confirmed this. In a letter Cheng sent to a friend, a poem was attached, indicating that the author's report was not false. The poem is similar to the one by Luo Binwang of the Tang Dynasty when he was in prison. The poem says: "All day long I hear the sound of rain on the tower, spring comes and goes without sentiment.</p>
<p>Red Bean Anecdotes by Li Shuping</p>
<p>The red bean is originally a product of Lingnan. Unexpectedly, it also exists in Hunan. My friend, Mr. Yang Quansun, lives in Hengyang, and there are two red bean trees in his garden. Initially, he did not know about them. It was because a certain lady frequently visited the Yang family, and this lady was an advocate of homosexual love. Her lover suddenly went far away and sent a bean in a letter, calling it a "red bean rained down from heaven." The lady was extremely happy and showed it to Mr. Yang, considering it a rare treasure. Not long after, one day Yang was walking in his garden and found countless smooth red particles in the grass. He picked them up and saw that they were no different from the one the lady had shown him. He suspected that there might be a tree in the garden and searched everywhere, finally finding two trees. The branches and trunks were light green, like a parasol tree, and could be ten feet tall. The beans all grew like broad beans. As a result, people from far and near came to explore the curiosity, and for a time, the household was crowded. Recently, I received many pieces from Mr. Yang, red and beautiful. I still remember Chengzhai's notes, which said, "Red beans are bright red and never change for a thousand years." So I had them inlaid into rings and earrings as gifts for my wife, Di Hua, with unique beauty. Thus, I recorded the beginning and end of the story.</p>
<p>The Flower Festival has passed, and so has Qingming. Sending a lonely boat against the current, the dawn breeze blows through ten thousand mountains. In my dreams, I still talk of returning home." The title is "Song of Washing Stream Sand." His poem to his three friends says, "All laws should be abandoned, alas! People at crossroads, where to put this heart without joy or sorrow? Listen to the rain in the deep mountains, still singing of the spring of the earth. Diamond is originally indestructible, cherish this body in the water."</p>
<h3 id="e169">Mr. Cheng as I Know Him (Part 1) by Shen Zhuoran <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Cheng's surname is Cheng, his given name is Ne, his style name is Dihua. He was originally from Anhui. He only lived in Shanghai since his grandfather's generation. In his youth, he focused on books and immersed himself in learning. Later, he studied the techniques of Shen Buhai and Han Fei, thus abandoning his original profession, but he did not achieve anything and soon gave it up and did something else. Later, he worked at the Progressive Bookstore and the New Shenbao Newspaper Office. When he was over fifty years old, the Datong Bookstore recruited him with courtesy to be the chief proofreader, and he ended his career there.</p>
<p>On the 8th of this month, which was a weekend, he returned home after a late-night drink and went to bed. His residence was a small three-room building with a cloth ladder outside the door. Mr. Cheng accidentally forgot about it and suddenly fell, seriously injured, and then died. Alas, how tragic! He usually did not reveal his age and only knew that he was just over sixty years old. Mr. Cheng's family was not wealthy, but rather poor. Since his father's time, Mr. Cheng did not know much about household finances. After his father died, he became the eldest brother, so he took care of family affairs a little, but he had lofty aspirations and did not engage in production. In a few years, the family became poorer, so he entrusted everything to his wife and stopped asking about it. It is said that his wife, Wu, was gentle and virtuous. Mr. Cheng initially admired the unrestrained style of Du Sijun, and often visited brothels and spent a lot of money. His wife heard about it slightly and tried to persuade him with subtle words. Mr. Cheng suddenly became angry and turned against her, but then regretted it. After his wife's death, he deeply blamed himself and from then on disappeared from the brothels.</p>
<p>He has two younger brothers. The second brother's right hand has been disabled since childhood, so he stays at home and lives off the family. The youngest brother is engaged in business, and the brothers are very affectionate and do not separate the property. He has four daughters, three of whom died young. The eldest daughter married a Tang from the same town. Her husband died early, leaving her a widow. Fortunately, she has a granddaughter, so she is determined to raise her orphan. Mr. Cheng used his income from writing to help her. When Mr. Cheng passed away, his daughter cried very sadly. The father-daughter relationship was indeed innate, and the suffering of the widow from now on will be unspeakable, which is especially sad.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng was good at proofreading and had been engaged in this field for no less than twenty years. His writing style followed the Shuowen Jiezi. He regarded vulgar and broken characters as enemies and took pleasure in replacing them with true characters. If there were errors or questionable points in the manuscripts, he would definitely examine them carefully and then repair the gaps and correct the mistakes. He once said that modern education does not emphasize elementary studies, so even contemporary literary giants write carelessly and do not study them thoroughly, so shallow people are even less to blame. He was knowledgeable and had a strong memory. People with doubts would come to him for clarification, and Mr. Cheng would explain the origin without being impatient. Therefore, those who asked were all able to understand and were all happy to leave. When I first came to assist in proofreading, Mr. Cheng ignored me very much. Gradually, we became familiar, and he knew that I was not reckless and destructive, so he analyzed doubts and appreciated wonders with me, discussing the merits and demerits of ancient and modern literary figures. When our opinions differed, we argued with each other for days. When there was agreement, we admired each other.</p>
<p>A strange story overheard</p>
<h3 id="e170">Travel Notes from Nanyang (31) <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>26. I wanted to investigate the situation of squatters in this area. Their poverty is similar to the shacks outside Shanghai, or they live on a small boat. The top is steamed and the bottom is humid. They still put up door couplets, from which I know they are Chinese. The boatmen mostly travel in extremely dirty small rivers. The rickshaw pullers are mostly from Fujian. There is no place to shower or shelter from the rain. It is not as good as Shanghai, where Western missionaries have built small shelters from the rain. They do not know a single word of social education. I believe that since Nanyang relies on the labor of workers to develop, it should at least consider the lives and health of the lower classes. Places for workers to shower and shelter from the rain should be established everywhere. Japan even has drinking places for cattle and horses established throughout the streets. Does the wealth of Nanyang not match this? The greater the difference between the rich and poor classes, the more the feeling of class conflict will arise. We should reconcile them well, so as to eliminate the seeds of killing before they sprout. If we do not know how to seek social welfare and pursue the way of coexistence, it will be dangerous. Nanyang is gradually entering a Western capitalist lifestyle. The gap between rich and poor is too great. We should use Dr. Sun Yat-sen's plan for local autonomy and the Principle of People's Livelihood to make some adjustments. However, in the current schools, the British still restrict the Three Principles of the People and often send supervisors to check and prohibit them. However, the supervisors are still Chinese, covering their ears and stealing bells, just like the Manchus in the Qing Dynasty sent Han Chinese to investigate Han Chinese cases.</p>
<p>I once visited Nantong. Nantong has a worker education institution, worker residences, and nursing homes, homes for the blind and deaf, and orphanages. Although there are classes, there is still compassion and pity, which is more comforting than nothing. Now Nanyang is known for its capital wealth, but the lives of the lower-class workers are like this. How can we talk about autonomy, education, and health? There are often beggars and blind people begging for money on the streets.</p>
<p>27. I visited the Guanghui Zhao Hospital, which is run by the three counties of Guangzhou, Huizhou, and Zhaoqing. Staying means being hospitalized. The content and scale are quite impressive. There are three hundred men and women. It is clean with many trees. Those who die are provided with coffins and buried. But there is one drawback: because staying in the hospital is free, some people stay for as long as ten years. It is not a hospital but a nursing home. The name does not match the reality. The people in the hospital cannot remove them because they are kind-hearted and unwilling to kick them out. It is limited to people from the three counties, and people from other counties are not allowed. There is also a charge of one yuan per room per day to ensure special treatment. The long-term residents have no work to do and sit and wait for death. Is it not economical? We should use religion and art to purify their minds. Otherwise, eating and waiting for death is too bitter. Is it life? In short, it is difficult to talk about the middle way in the world. Competing will kill people. Talking about mercy and joy makes the hospital a nursing home, which is too good. I had a minor illness and received medicine as a gift, for which I am very grateful.</p>
<p>Today, science is prosperous, and superstition has long been broken. The story of foxes and ghosts is even less talked about. However, sometimes it also shows people strange news and events that make people half-believe and half-doubt. The following is a very detailed statement from a friend from the countryside. I will record it below:</p>
<p>In Yan Family Building in Liuzhao Bay, Nanyi Township, there is a famous "Little Granny" who has been working as a baby bather and midwife for more than thirty years. Late one night last month, she suddenly heard a knock on the door. She opened the door and saw two young girls who said they came from Er Tuan (about four or five miles away from Yan Family Building) and specially invited the old woman to deliver a baby. The woman did not suspect anything because of her profession and put on her clothes and went out. She saw a small boat waiting on the riverbank and went on the boat. The two young girls paddled and arrived in a moment. When she went ashore, she saw broken walls and scattered steps covered with fine grass. She entered a courtyard behind, and the stone road was smooth and no longer overgrown. She then arrived at the inner room and saw crystal curtains and embroidered screens with fragrant mist spraying people. When she asked the surname, they said it was Qu. The pregnant woman wore a red jacket and an embroidered skirt around her waist. She was in increasing pain and about to give birth. Soon she gave birth to a son. The woman bathed the baby and wrapped it up. She examined the dressing table and furnishings, which were extremely luxurious, knowing that it was a noble family. However, the lights in the room were the old oil lamps, and the light was unusually dim. Looking back at the pregnant woman, her face was like dust, and her pupils opened and closed from time to time, and her spirits seemed extremely tired. She exchanged pleasantries with the woman and ordered the two young girls to prepare dishes and entertain her. While she was staring, she suddenly saw a pair of red shoes on the head of the bed, each with a gold ingot attached, and she immediately became suspicious. Then she followed the girl and turned into the outer room, where dishes were lined up, which were quite delicious to eat. After the meal, she was given ten taels of gold as a reward and left. The two girls still sent her back on the original boat. In a moment, it was dawn. Her husband had already gotten up to cook and told her what he had seen and examined the money he had paid, which were all paper money for the dead. He couldn't help but be horrified. Her husband then ran to the riverbank, but the boat had disappeared. Afterwards, she told the neighbors, who were all amazed and said that the woman would not live long.</p>
<p>Short News The first Achievement Exhibition of the Changming Art School opened the day before yesterday. There were a total of more than 500 works, divided into six rooms for Chinese painting, calligraphy, seal carving, and Western painting. Overall, the works of the whole school can express special personalities, which is admirable. In the morning, there was drizzle, and fewer guests came. In the afternoon, it cleared up, and there was a steady stream of visitors. Many painting pieces were decided to be sold.</p>

<p>Chapter 12: Farewell Banquet, Leaving Wine, Picking Flowers, Leaving a Pretty Shadow, Famous Garden Gathering, Tea Fight, Viewing Fragrant Posture</p>
<p>The towel has also been wiped, and the lemonade has also been delivered. The waiters know that Mr. Zuo is coming to book the room, and he can't be coming alone for a big meal. Then a small waiter came with a plate of snacks in a glass basin. It was a stick of homemade almond biscuits for the guests to fill their hunger while waiting. At this time, Zuo Shichen had already asked them to bring over a Dou Sheng plate. Inside the Dou Sheng plate were two broken pens, an ink ball, and a square, chipped inkstone. In addition, there were two kinds of light red tickets, one was a guest ticket and the other was a gambling ticket. Zuo Shichen first held a pen in his hand. A clever waiter came over and ground the broken ink on the broken inkstone. Zuo Shichen suddenly remembered the spirit of Li Taibai in the Kunqu Opera grinding ink for Gao Lishi, like a shadow passing through his heart. Looking at the pen in his hand, the tip of the pen seemed to be glued firmly with raw lacquer. He seemed to press it hard on the inkstone, and the tip of the pen shrank into the pen tube. He hid inside and refused to come out again. Poor Zuo Shichen was short-sighted. He thought he had already dipped it in ink and was about to wave his pen and write, but it was just a bare stick, a headless ghost. He wondered, "Hey, where did his head go?" In fact, the waiter grinding the ink saw it clearly and just bent over laughing, and said, "Mr. Zuo, change one." Then he handed over another pen. This one was also like a small broom. He thought that on ordinary days he would naturally write gambling tickets to summon Ruiyun. Today, he wanted to change his method and write a guest ticket to invite her. Ajin was her adjutant and would naturally also be invited. The guest ticket arrived in the hands of the waiters, and they took a look first and happily took it down. At the same time, they said to their patron, "Go right away, Mr. Zuo. Go right away. Our shop also knows Little Ruiyun. I'll tell them to give her the guest ticket if they run into her on the road." Zuo Shichen thought that writing the guest ticket was just a formality. He had already agreed to invite her without writing the guest ticket, and she would naturally come. At that time, he took out his watch and looked at it. It was already 7:30. But Ruiyun hadn't come yet. He thought that she would definitely come within this half hour anyway. Didn't Ajin just say on the phone that she would definitely arrive by 8 o'clock at the latest? A moment later, the person who sent the guest ticket came back and said that the guest ticket was sent to Qingfang, and they said that the person was not at home. She had gone to sing. But Zuo Shizhan felt that this half hour was longer than any other time. The waiters came to flatter him and said, "Mr. Zuo, do you want cigarettes?" One of the waiters said, "Zuo Xingkuang doesn't smoke cigarettes." Although Zuo Shichen didn't smoke cigarettes, he wanted to smoke one in this loneliness. He also remembered that Ruiyun often smoked cigarettes secretly to avoid her aunt's eyes. Today, for the sake of the dinner, he should also prepare some cigarettes.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Gold Standard Changes Greatly <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Fluctuations of More Than Ten Taels Have Seen New Peaks</p>
<p>Decline of Three Taels and Three Cents Lacks Huge Transactions</p>
<p>The 600-Tael Mark Fluctuates. Yesterday, the 17th, the attitude of the gold standard was very chaotic, turning from weakness to sharpness, and finally tending to weaken, fluctuating around 600 taels, sometimes changing by three or four taels. It was difficult to predict the changes in an instant. After all the storms, the entire market had a difference of ten taels, and people's hearts were unsettled. The foreign exchange was still tight. There were no large numbers of interbank notes bought or sold by the banks. Hengxing Zhifeng, Yuanyuan Chengyong, Fuchang, and others had no fixed pattern of inflow and outflow, and most of them were generally balanced. The real reason was that the rise and fall were too great, so we should be cautious to avoid danger. From the early market, the opening was low because the large notes were slightly reduced and unmoved. Afterwards, it fell within 595 taels. Later, buyers seemed to be active, and the banks absorbed spot goods, which had already risen sharply by eight or nine taels, breaking yesterday's new peak, reaching 604 taels and 5 cents. However, sellers were unremitting, and the foreign exchange was weakening again. However, the rise and fall were uncertain, advancing and retreating at the 600-tael mark. The large companies were balanced in and out. Zhifeng Yunda Decheng slightly increased. Xiangyu Chunyuan Shunli and others sold out. However, the market situation turned from strong to weak, with fluctuations of six or seven taels. The foreign exchange was especially loose. Finally, it was between 595 taels. Yesterday, the British silver fell 1875, and the silver price also decreased 375.</p>
<p>A Spot Price of 604 Taels and a Half. The price of gold for August opened and fell by 3 taels and 3 cents, calculated as 595 taels and a half. The gross price ranged from 94 taels and 3 cents to 7 taels and 8 cents, but each number came out and was re-included. The exchange rate was average. In the near future, the British gold bank did 5 pence 75 to 8125 shillings. The announcement did not move people's hearts. A setback then retreated to 95 taels 34 cents. Later, the domestic market showed a slightly better picture. In July, the British gold did 5 pence 75, and Citibank and Mitsui did 35 yuan 9375 with each other, so the gold price plus 4 taels was 999 taels 89 cents. At about 10 o'clock, it returned to 7 taels and a half. Suddenly, the bank's buying price for spot goods was 96 taels and a half, so it jumped up by four or five taels in a moment, breaking through the 600-tael mark. However, there were two taels of ups and downs. By 10:30, it suddenly rose to 604 taels and 5 cents. Afterwards, the market was extremely chaotic, with three or four taels of fluctuations. The exchange rate was still average. By 11 o'clock, it had fallen to 98 taels and 5 cents. There were many sellers. At noon, it returned to 602 taels and a half, making it unpredictable. By the time the market closed at noon, the price of 600 taels 008 cents was still calculated as 683 taels and 4 cents, with a small difference of more than 80 taels.</p>
<p>95 Taels and a Half Closed the Market. The market started at 602 taels. Hengxing and others bought in. In a moment, it fell by five or six taels. Hengxing Chunyuan Yongxiangyu and others sold out in succession. The exchange rate also collapsed. In September, the British gold did 6 pence 1875. HSBC absorbed 6 pence 125 in August. Then Sumitomo bought 1875 in August. People's hearts were very weak. At 2:30, it was 95 taels and 5 cents. Later, there were slight buyers, but the sellers retreated, so it returned to a high of three taels. At 3:30, it was 98 taels and a half. After 4 o'clock, it returned to a tired state. There was no one to consult on the table. The big companies wanted to sell, but it was not easy to trade. So it fell sharply again, shedding three taels, calculated as 95 taels. By 4:30, the market was 595 taels and 5 cents, down 3 taels and 3 cents from the previous day.</p>
<p>The Industry is Generally Balanced. An investigation of the maximum price of 604 taels and 5 cents and the minimum price of 594 taels and 3 cents in one day shows a difference of 10 taels 02 cents. The price still needs to be suppressed by 87 or 88 taels. The goods opened at 95 taels and a half in the morning, closed at 600 taels 007 cents at noon, and closed at 601 taels and 94 taels in the afternoon. According to industry transactions, Zhifeng Yongwanxing Shunli Jiutai Yuancheng Yongfuchang Yu Dahengxing and others have no fixed pattern of inflow and outflow. Xiangyu Yiyu and retail customers have all come out. Yuanmao Yonda Decheng Yuanxing Yongyong Chengcang Yu Yuanyong and others have all paid in. In the afternoon, Decheng Fuchang slightly increased. Xiangyu Chunyuan Yuanyuan Kangxiang Yu Da and others sold out. Shunli Wanxing Hengxing came out and went in again, roughly evenly. However, each number has no overnight notes. The big companies had 1,200 to 1,300 entries and exits in the previous market, and more than 1,600 entries and exits in the later market, which are generally balanced. The Guang companies totaled about 1,000 entries and exits, and most of them were balanced.</p>

<p>The Further the Hedge, the Quieter the Transaction</p>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC listed exchange rates. Except for Hong Kong, which added one tael to 85 taels, the rest did not change. However, the internal exchange rates seemed to be tight, but there were ups and downs from time to time. In the morning, it was average. Then it rose. In the afternoon, it weakened again. The gold standard also had ten taels of change and finally fell. People's hearts were dazed and unsettled.

The banks mutually did 100,000 pounds and did more than 100,000 US dollars. Chinese merchants rarely came in or out. The Japanese gold only traded a small number of old ones with Sumitomo and Dalian. Because the hedging was not smooth in the gold industry, they watched and did not move forward. People's hearts seemed to be weak, and the market atmosphere tended to be loose.</p>

<p>Exchange Rate Unmoved While Foreign Yarn, Raw Cotton Fall Sharply</p>
<p>Retail Investors Liquidate, Short Positions Continue to Increase</p>
<p>The yarn market is relatively weak. With the exchange rate unmoved, U.S. cotton of three grades still fell. Most people expect that U.S. cotton will be difficult to stabilize. Retail investors are therefore bearish, but the buyers' attitude is also tough, based on the exchange relationship. In short, the situation is extremely complicated and difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Rebounds Slightly. Before the opening of the foreign marked yarn market, the drop in the three grades of yarn and raw cotton was too severe. Sellers continued to increase their short positions, and retail investors liquidated, each falling by 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 yuan. In the afternoon, the situation became more and more weak due to the drop in raw cotton. However, a check of the accounts showed that large households rarely sold, and in fact, although the environment felt unfavorable, it was due to retail investors' panic. Each fell by 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 yuan to 1.23 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was estimated at 14,450 bales. The closing prices are listed on the left.</p>

<p>U.S. Cotton Falls for Nine Consecutive Days, Hankou Marked Cotton Drops 0.45 Yuan</p>
<p>The cotton market is weak again, and the decline is sharp. This is because U.S. cotton has fallen for nine consecutive days, and the 12.03-cent level in October has already been broken. Retail investors are panicked and liquidating, and there is a temporary unease in the market. Moreover, the yarn market has deteriorated again, and the actual demand is also weak. Therefore, at the beginning of the morning, people's hearts felt more and more dejected.</p>
<p>Japanese Firm Yu Da Throws 3,000+ Dan of Futures Cotton Each. The opening of the futures cotton market saw a sharp decline in U.S. cotton, and the selling pressure intensified. Each month fell by 0.02 yuan, and the market fell by another 0.05 yuan. It was found that the buyers were all from the Jinzi firm, thrown out by retail investors. In the afternoon, Japanese firms threw out 2,000-3,000 dan in July and August, and Yu Da threw out 3,200 dan. The situation in the market eased again, and each month fell by 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was estimated at 43,500 dan.

<p>Rayon Price Drops, Raw Cotton Affected</p>
<p>New York Telegraph on the 16th: The cotton fabric market is currently not very good, even worse than any period in the past two years. The only thing that excites the market is the slight increase in clothing sales. Cotton mills have been hearing about production cuts since early spring, but supply still far exceeds demand. Various cotton fabrics and many popular fabrics that have undergone finishing processes are now weak. This is proof that supply exceeds demand. Cotton manufacturers are now paying close attention to the price reductions of natural silk and rayon. Many people expect that lower silk prices will make cotton mills more inclined to produce rayon fabrics, as these fabrics are easier to sell and more profitable than cotton fabrics. Speakers are concerned about tariff issues, believing that tariffs will not only increase domestic competition but also cause other countries to take retaliatory actions, which will be detrimental to U.S. exports. The recent drop in the stock market and the continued downward trend in the prices of major commodities have caused a bleak atmosphere in the Wall Street market. The future outlook is currently uncertain.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Food Rice Market Continues to Rise <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>White Geng Rice Changes to Yuan, Rising Steadily</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of river rice in Zhabei was scarce, and the stock was gradually thinning. The street market was quite brisk, and white geng rice rose by about 0.2 yuan again. The highest-grade top-quality geng rice requires 22 yuan, and the middle-quality geng rice from outside the customs is all around 21 yuan. However, the Social Affairs Bureau, in view of the recent rising rice prices, has strict restrictions. According to the white geng rice limit plate last month, it was relaxed to 21 yuan as the highest price limit. Now it has exceeded the price limit again. However, the stock of geng rice is exhausted, which is due to the fact that the market price of production and sales is not cost-effective. Transportation merchants and cargo customers are wary of the restrictions of the authorities and the cost of losses, so they are waiting and seeing without loading. This is the main reason for the recent scarcity of arrivals in this port. The fundamental solution is to first dredge the rice situation in the mainland, so that the source of supply in this port is uninterrupted, or it may be helpful. Thin rice is rising step by step, and all incoming goods are sold out. The top-quality goods require 21 yuan. It is seen that the corner and half of the sheep's horn tip have a few factory warehouses, and the ship goods are scarce. The sales are brisk, and the high-quality goods reach 20 yuan and change. The rising trend of Yuan has accelerated, because the market sales of customer firms are brisk, and the arrival of goods is scarce. The sellers have raised the price for sale, so the price has risen by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. At present, the top-quality change Yuan requires 18.8 yuan.</p>
<p>In South Shanghai, the number of river boats arriving is less than ten. The market is surprisingly brisk. The arrival of Changzhou-Wuxi northern geng rice is very rare, and most of the stock has also been sold out, so there is no standard market price. The route for Suzhou-Tongji machine-grown rice is extremely active, and the big market has risen by another 0.2 yuan, and the high-quality goods are gradually reaching the 20 yuan mark. However, the transaction prices in the market are different, and the restrictions of the Social Affairs Bureau are extremely strict. The sellers seem to be extremely worried, so the prices of top-quality goods from both the north and the south are not very accurate in recent days. The arrival of southern thin early rice is becoming less and less. The Ningbo and Tongzhou firms in this street are all concerned. The market is extremely brisk, and the market price is rising by the corner. The high-quality goods have already opened at more than 20 yuan. The stock of Tongbian rice is also scarce, and the price of guest Yuan also requires 18 yuan. The sales of Yin Yuan are especially brisk, and the price is also rising by the corner. Although the rice market is seeing continuous upward movement at the moment, the trend is still rising and not falling.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Vermicelli Market Plummets <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Each Month Falls by More Than 0.04 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the prices of vermicelli in the market fell sharply like mercury pouring onto the ground, with no restraint. The prices of each month fell by 0.045 to 0.056 yuan, and the far-term prices were especially weak, attracting the attention of new short sellers. Manufacturers and bulls alike believed that the prices were already high and had satisfied their desires, so they also sought to sell, resulting in such a sharp decline. In the afternoon, short sellers slightly entered the market, and the market turned stable again. In the end, the sunny weather and the fear of people's hearts still resulted in weakness. It is estimated that June fell by 0.045 yuan, July, August, and October fell by 0.0425 yuan, September fell by 0.0375 yuan, and November fell by 0.0475 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Wheat Market Suddenly Reverses <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>High Prices Prevent Changes, Bulls Release Continuously</p>
<p>At the Same Time, New Shorts Discovered, Falling by a Few Coins</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market yesterday, because of the continuous rainy weather, the price rose sharply, and people's hearts were brought high. With the good weather, the bulls were wary of high prices and sold off one after another. In addition, new shorts were concerned, and the market immediately saw a slump, which was the opposite of the sharp rise in the previous day. However, its crazy and evil aura was similar. As a result, each recovered slightly by about 0.01 yuan, and the closing market was slightly stable. It is estimated that June fell by 0.011 yuan, July and August each fell by 0.009 yuan, September fell by 0.006 yuan, October fell by 0.01 yuan, and November fell by 0.008 yuan. The arrival of spot wheat is extremely rapid. The total market opened at around 20,000, and the price also suddenly fell by about 0.01 yuan. It is estimated that Dongtai wheat is at 5.07 taels, Weiting wheat is at 5.056 taels, Shaoxing, Gaoyou, Yangzhou, Jiangbei Sha City, etc. wheat is at 5.023 taels, Zhenjiang, Liuhe, Nanjing, etc. wheat is at 4.95 taels, Kunshan wheat is at 5 taels, Wusong wheat is at 4.9 taels, and Pudong wheat is at 4.75 taels, with different prices for medium and low quality.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Arrival of Foreign Rice, Price Drops <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the arrival of too much foreign rice, some cargo owners sought to sell after the morning inquiry rose, and the importers turned to wait and see. The price immediately fell by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. The total market opened at 12,000 to 13,000 bags. If the local and customer imports become weaker again today and tomorrow, the market price may continue to fall, which is not surprising. It is estimated that 1,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon opened at 16.55 to 16.95 yuan, 100 bags of No. 2 opened at 16.05 yuan, 2,000 bags of small silk opened at 15.78 yuan, 2,000 bags of large silk opened at 15.23 yuan, and 2,500 bags of Min Dang opened at 16.25 to 16.20 yuan. Also, 5,000 bags of various colored rough rice also followed the decline.</p>

<p>Yesterday, due to the lack of progress in overseas silk telegraphs, the stomach was still stagnant. Although the American firms had new factories going through, the selection of goods was too strict. The uniformity had to be at least 80 points, and the opening price was not high. The cost of the factories was not enough, and there were few undertakers. Yesterday, only Qianli entered 40 packages of new factory medium body B-grade silk in July and August, and the price was still flat and weak.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Jinhua Summer Cocoons Have Appeared <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The silkworm season in the Jinhua Prefecture of Zhejiang Province is earlier than in other counties. This year, farmers have joyfully harvested spring cocoons and supplemented them with summer silkworms. However, the weather is not right, and the summer is behaving like autumn. The climate is cold and there is excessive rainfall, resulting in the discovery of white muscardine disease in silkworm ants, causing a lot of losses. Early silkworms have fallen off, and cocoon production is decreasing. It is heard that only one or two cocoon shops have opened. The estimated price of cocoons will not exceed 40 yuan. It is expected that they will officially open in the coming days.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were still no large-scale sales of red and green box teas from various sources. European firms were taking a wait-and-see attitude in view of the soaring gold prices and chaotic exchange rates. Yesterday, only 1,180 boxes of red and green tea were traded in the entire market, and the market price fell by another 0.02 to 0.03 taels.</p>

<p>Recently, with the activity of the sales market, the market price of black melon seeds has rebounded, rising by about 0.07 to 0.08 yuan compared to the previous price. Yesterday, 100 packages of mid-range goods opened at 100,000. It was found that the stock in the market is still thick, with a total of about 100,000 pieces. The current market price is as follows: high-grade Jikui seeds 13 taels, medium-grade Jizhong seeds 12.5 taels, Yangshan seeds 11.56 taels, Dalian seeds (no stock) about 9.5 taels, and the remaining middle and low grades range from 10.02 to 9.4 taels.

<h3 id="e191">Regarding "Xinyou" Chunsen <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>After reading the Xinyou Drama Society's "Letter Regarding the Difficult Drama Movement," I have a better understanding of the efforts of the Xinyou Drama Society and everything about them. Their "Motives for Holding the Difficult Drama Movement," "Planned Repertoire," "Various Difficulties During the Movement," "Results of the Movement," and "Our Future" are all faithfully and sincerely shown to us. I especially sympathize with the various difficulties that unfortunately occurred during this Difficult Drama Movement, and the other problems that followed from the difficulties were even more inevitable. However, this also made the outside world clearer about their spirit and perseverance in the New Art Drama Movement. Regarding the results of this movement, they themselves said, "We ourselves are very regretful, and everyone has a quite dissatisfied look on their faces, because we know our shortcomings best, and we have not achieved our ideals." Yes, the words of the Taoist immortal in Peach Blossom Spring still linger in my ears: "There is always higher than high, and better than better. Everything is endless. Even if we exhaust our life's energy, we cannot do it all." Then work hard, just as Mr. Yuan Muzhi has long told us, "In Napoleon's dictionary, there is no 'difficult.' In our dictionary, there is also no 'difficult.' In our dictionary, there is only 'do.'" Work hard, comrades, the future is not dark. We are willing to use our passionate enthusiasm as a kind of cotton force to assist and encourage each other, in an attempt to advance our drama movement. We thank the gentlemen of Xinyou for "We are always as hardworking as Miss Zou, as persevering as the Taoist immortal, and we will not disappoint him." This not only fills me with unspeakable gratitude and joy, but also inspires considerable respect from all friends who love drama. Now, I will briefly address their "Our Future" as a small contribution.</p>
<p>Indeed, during this movement, the small number of spectators made us doubt. In this modern era of unsound national spirit, "Uncle Vanya," "Dog's Dance," and "Peach Blossom Spring" are all targeted excitants. They truly gave us the power of the special functions of drama. Therefore, based on the script, Xinyou's selection of these three plays is valuable. Moreover, although Xinyou's performance art and stage skills have not yet reached perfection, they have already achieved considerable success.</p>
<p>I dare say that Mr. Yuan Muzhi's performance and makeup make him the only actor in China today. Other actors also have considerable training and cultivation. Here, I am not especially praising Mr. Yuan Muzhi. All friends who have seen him act say the same thing. Then, although the number of spectators is small and the economic distress may bring them to an unimaginable point, in the history of drama in the 19th year of the Republic, if the gentlemen who compile the history of drama do not wear colored glasses, they will surely leave a glorious history. Therefore, Xinyou's Difficult Drama Movement failed on the surface, but it greatly succeeded in reality. Moreover, "failure is the mother of success." Then, Xinyou's Difficult Drama Movement should be continued with effort. We are even more enthusiastically looking forward to Xinyou completing the Difficult Drama Movement project, arousing social belief and the sympathy of the audience from the partial to the whole. Xinyou's drama has not left the path of awakening the national spirit. Every play has a metaphor for awakening the nation. They are taking an absolutely correct direction. In my imagination, the public's understanding of valuable drama may not always be so superficial. If we do not relax our publicity efforts, they will definitely have a further understanding in the near future. We are very saddened that our drama circles are either falling into errors, simply insulting the original function of drama, only knowing to use it as a weapon for struggle and propaganda, and forgetting the mission of dramatic art, or they are still inevitably stuck in low-level tastes. Seeing Xinyou's three plays this time, the deep impression moved us, made us understand the true meaning of life, and made us open our minds and boldly take big strides on the journey of the enlightened life. In short, it is commendable to awaken and inspire our lazy national character. If the Xinyou Society changes the way of performing drama to make the audience have a general understanding, this opinion is of course very good. However, in the future, the selection of plays should be like "Uncle Vanya," "Dog's Dance," and "Peach Blossom Spring," focusing on the content of the play and concentrating on "national consciousness." This is the project that I hope Xinyou will continue to undertake.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Zhu Suicheng has this plan, it can be implemented as soon as possible. Finally, I look forward to the hard work of the Xinyou Drama Society.</p>
<p>May the gentlemen of Xinyou correct me.</p>
<p>(Attached Communication) Mr. Yuan Muzhi is the actor I love too much. When I truly appreciate and comprehend Mr. Yuan's performance, my emotions will flow with it. Although I have no opportunity to meet Mr. Yuan, I deeply believe in him. Now, I venture to ask Mr. Yuan to bestow his communication address so that I can go forward and ask for advice. Would this be a luxury? I hope that what you give me is not disappointment. Please send it to the Youth Garden Editorial Department of Shen Bao for forwarding. Respectfully, Chunsen.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Fudan Drama Society Public Performance <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Fudan Drama Society publicly performed "Cyrano de Bergerac" at the New Central Theater. The audience was extremely crowded. That evening, because Mr. Ma Junyanxiang was temporarily sick and unable to perform on stage, the role of Cyrano was played by Mr. Hong Shen. Although he lacked practice and was not proficient in the lines, Mr. Hong's portrayal of Cyrano's personality and identity was very appropriate. Those who knew him said that he was like the French Coquelin, which was not a false statement. However, because the society suddenly had this major change, it was inevitable that there were omissions in the affairs, especially since the advertising was completely entrusted to others and could not be taken care of. It is now known that the society will continue to perform at the New Central Theater tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e193">"The Merchant of Venice" Will Be Revived <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the drama movement in Shanghai has been surging and unstoppable. The Xinyou Drama Association and the Fudan Drama Society have successively given public performances in Shanghai. Among them, the Xinyou Drama Association's "The Merchant of Venice" has been the most praised by society. It is now known that it will be revived on the 21st and 22nd of this month at the Dangui First Stage. Preparations have been underway for nearly a month. It is heard that any parts of the script and scenery that are not satisfactory will be revised and rehearsed repeatedly. Even the slightest smile or gesture must be perfect before they are done. Their efforts are also bitter. (Gong Zhuo)</p>
<h3 id="e194">Disappointed Person <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Inside that solemn and silent clinic, there was only one doctor and me, and a patient filled with panic sat on a chair. Because a doctor who understood a little Cantonese had gone out to see a patient, I was able to go to the clinic because I had received the doctor's order to go and temporarily act as an interpreter to convey opinions between the two parties.</p>
<p>As usual, the doctor asked her name, age, and address, and then asked about her past medical history. It turned out that she was a person who had just come out of the countryside. Because her husband often disagreed with her opinions, they often quarreled with each other. Therefore, she decided to try the life of a divorcee. Unfortunately, she lived in a friend's house in Shanghai for two months and learned that her body had changed. She also felt various phenomena such as loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. With this obvious proof, she was even more worried about this little life. At the same time, thinking about her own future, she decided to sacrifice this little life.</p>
<p>However, this is not allowed by law. How can we violate the creed of humanitarianism for the sake of pitying her? The doctor simply and solemnly rejected the patient, but the patient begged extremely earnestly. In this dilemma, I also felt extremely difficult. I had no choice but to use some comforting words as a temporary relief. Unexpectedly, she used the catchphrase of the weak, saying that if it could not be done, she would rather die to cleanse everything about her. As she spoke, tears dripped down and finally she sobbed loudly.</p>
<p>"Don't cry. According to the doctor's examination results, it has not yet been determined that you are pregnant. Go back well, and don't make yourself seriously ill. After a month or two, you can come back here for an examination. I will pray for you, hoping that heaven will not be unfair, and hoping that the disappointed can be satisfied." I mustered up the courage to comfort her, and as a result, she also went back well. I watched the disappointed person's return journey in front of the school gate, and I fantasized about the mystery and ruggedness of life. (Bi Ling)</p>

<h3 id="e195">Incomparably Precious, Exquisitely Unparalleled <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Persian King's Royal Car Arrives</p>
<p>Commissioned from Studebaker's Pierce-Arrow Factory</p>
<p>King Reza Khan of Persia, in anticipation of the upcoming national celebrations, specifically commissioned a royal car from the Studebaker and Pierce-Arrow joint automobile factory in White Plains, New York, USA, to participate in parades and share joy with the people. Since accepting the commission, the factory, with its more than seventy years of automotive manufacturing experience, carefully designed and worked day and night to complete the car. It has now been fully completed and solemnly loaded for transport to Persia.</p>
<p>This car, gilded with gold, decorated with silver, inlaid with pearls and jade, is dazzling and incomparably luxurious. Although the time was pressing after its completion, and it was rushed for shipment without being displayed in America for an extended period, the two-day exhibition in New York already caused a sensation. It is estimated that more than 25,000 people visited, praising it and acknowledging its value.</p>
<p>According to a report by Ms. Della Meng published in World Travel Magazine, King of Persia is committed to reforms and striving for progress. His choice of Studebaker automobile for his use is enough to remind people of Persia's continuous renewal and eventual success. Although this custom-made royal car is one of the most luxurious and precious royal cars ever made, it is hardly representative of the daily life of the King of Persia. Although the King is the heir to all rights and wealth, he lives frugally. He always shares meals with the Queen, and the dishes are not delicacies and rarely exceed three bowls. He drinks moderately, smokes occasionally, and laughter fills the room, a truly exemplary family. The King is diligent in his duties and a model for his subjects. He rises at dawn every morning, exercises until six o'clock, and arrives at the office at eight o'clock. From eight to eleven-thirty, he receives his ministers and handles government affairs with utmost care, decisiveness, and solemnity. Afterwards, he retires for rest, either eating alone or with the Prince. At two o'clock, he continues to govern without interruption, year-round. He rarely hosts banquets for guests or officials, and even when he does, they are always filled with distinguished guests, never just one or two people, so as to save on expenses. Formal attire and all precious ornaments are never worn except at formal banquets. The King has no concubines but regards the Queen and children as his only companions. The King's new car is large and beautiful. The chassis is a standard Pierce-Arrow product with a wheelbase of 144 inches. The engine is a straight-eight cylinder type with 132 horsepower. The body construction is unprecedentedly luxurious. The exterior of the car is immaculate white, adding to its grandeur, and the gold trim makes it even more radiant and luxurious. The metal parts of the car, such as the mudguards, headlights, door panels, water tank, screen frame, bumper, and metal strips on the thick rubber running board, are all gilded, making them extremely luxurious. The double-sided car doors are engraved with artistic sculptures of the Persian royal crown, shining with golden light. The base of the crown is made of emerald green gemstones, complementing each other perfectly. The interior padding is made of light incense-colored silk fabric, embroidered with family crests and flower crowns, edged with gold and lined with white leather. The car window curtains are also made of silk fabric, decorated with lively patterns. The carpet on the floor of the car is made of wolfhound wool, specially selected from Russia. The cigarette holder and lighter are made of pure gold and inlaid with diamonds. The glass used in the car is all shatterproof. The front of the car, where the driver sits, is also splendid and exquisite. The dashboard and other parts are also plated with precious metals. The reason why the King of Persia specifically commissioned this car from the Studebaker and Pierce-Arrow joint automobile factory is that the factory's rich experience, high reputation, and the large number of high-end and luxurious cars it produces are recognized as leaders in the American automobile industry.</p>
<h3 id="e196">British Six-Wheeled Automobiles are Excellent and Abundantly Used by <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Payne's Exploration and Land Reclamation</p>
<p>On June 6th of last year, the Australian government organized a desert expedition to find the bodies of two aviators. The purpose of these two aviators was to seek the Southern Cross constellation from Australia to London, but tragically, they went missing a few days after departure. Searching for the bodies of these two people in the wilderness is no easy task, as it requires crossing the barren northern land. It was finally decided to use a Thornycroft six-wheeled automobile with a three-ton payload as a means of transportation for this mission. The vehicle was loaded with three and a half tons of fuel, drinking water, food, personnel, and other supplies and set off from the inland station of Newcastle Waters directly into the vast desert. At the beginning, the vehicle traveled in low gear due to the loose soil. Later, encountering thickets of trees and grass, and due to tire damage, progress was delayed. On June 13th, they reached their destination, and the bodies of the two aviators were recovered at the same time. The return trip was much easier because there were existing tracks to follow, taking only two and a half days to return to the original starting point of Newcastle Waters. They then proceeded to Alice Springs Railway Station, and the remains of the two men were transported by train. In total, apart from some tire punctures and damages, there were no other difficulties along the way.</p>
<p>The above is just a glimpse of the use of British six-wheeled automobiles. This type of six-wheeled automobile is widely used and extremely important for road finding and exploration. It has long demonstrated its special functions in South America, South Africa, Canada, Iraq, and other places. In Australia, another six-wheeled automobile with a four-ton payload, named Albion, regularly travels between Sydney and Forbes in New South Wales, a distance of 300 miles. This journey is slightly different from others, as it must cross Mount Brolo, which is 4,000 feet above the ground. The entire round trip takes four days. Morris commercial six-wheeled automobiles, after completing tests in the tropical region of Quito, were tested on the old trails between Riobamba and Guaranda in the Andes Mountains. It has now been widened, but its slope remains the same as it has been for centuries, with only mules and horses traveling this road, carrying passengers and cargo. Now, Morris commercial automobiles regularly travel between the two cities, carrying twelve passengers and a half-ton of cargo, crossing the Andes' La Cumbre Pass, which is 4,200 meters above the ground, with slopes reaching about 30%.</p>
<p>In Canada, Thornycroft six-wheeled automobiles were tested in the northern Ontario mines, which were once icy and snowy lands. Previously, the only means of transportation were sleds and dog sleds. The entire journey was over 2,000 miles and took two weeks, progressing smoothly even when the temperature sometimes dropped to thirty degrees below zero. No mechanical adjustments were needed during the entire trip. For the companies involved in this test, it means that there can now be year-round automobile transportation to replace the American four-wheeled automobiles that can only operate for four months. When surveying the railway line between Rothsay and Walvis Bay in South Africa, Thornycroft six-wheeled automobiles were also used to cross the Kalahari Desert.</p>

<p>Thieves are not interested in cars but in clothing, jewelry, luggage, baseball bats, etc. If the car owner forgets to lock the car, it is easy to lose these items. This is a case of the drunkard's heart not being in the wine.</p>
<p>According to police investigations, there are very few cases of breaking windows to steal things because the sound of breaking is too loud, so car thieves prefer to wait for unlocked or easily opened cars to carry out their mysterious means. This picture shows a traffic patrol officer demonstrating the Fly-wheel safety door handle installed on the Fly-wheel car body.</p>
<p>The entire journey was 600 miles long, and there was no opportunity to add water or fuel along the way. Extreme care was taken to keep the engine cool. The temperature at midnight was below zero, while the daytime was unbearably hot. Except for a few tire punctures that caused slight stops, there were no other accidents during the entire journey.</p>
<p>The South African railway's automobile route is 10,000 miles long, with 400 Thornycroft automobiles, most of which are three-</p>

<p>ton or five-ton six-wheeled automobiles. These automobiles sometimes have to travel 200 miles off the railway, where there was previously no road transport and only mules and horses were relied upon. In addition, Graham five-ton six-wheeled automobiles also play an important role in South Africa. Some of the trips were difficult but were completed safely. Albion six-wheeled automobiles have received excellent praise in India. Last year, the Indian government ordered 222 automobiles for a price of £250,000. These automobiles are also heavily used on the Abyssinian border, where the terrain is rugged and difficult to navigate, but they can perform satisfactorily. Therefore, the six-wheeled automobiles manufactured by Broughton are used for land reclamation in various places and can demonstrate their outstanding performance.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Advantages of the Marmon Eight-Cylinder Car, Good People <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The ratio of engine power to weight is related to the agility and sluggishness of a car's movements. Most vehicles must increase power with weight to perform adequately, but not Marmon automobiles. Increasing weight does not reduce power. These characteristics are the result of years of dedicated research and improvement by Marmon car engineers.</p>
<p>An engine with 50 horsepower driving a 2,000-pound car will be stronger than driving a 4,000-pound car. Driving a light car requires only one horsepower for every 40 pounds, while driving 80 pounds also uses one horsepower, so the difference in performance must be half as weak. The power-to-weight ratio of the 1930 Marmon automobiles is extremely remarkable, able to drive twice the weight without reducing power, adding comfort, luxury, and agility, which are the advantages of this new type of car.</p>
<p>The Marmon Big Eight-Cylinder car has an engine power of 125 horsepower, and each horsepower can tow 34.09 pounds of weight. The Marmon No. 79 Big Eight-Cylinder car has 107 horsepower, and each horsepower can tow 36.06 pounds of weight. The power-to-weight ratio of the Marmon No. 69 is one horsepower for every 36.09 pounds of weight. The Marmon R-Type engine has 77 horsepower, each horsepower for every 36.08 pounds of weight. The Marmon No. 69 engine also has great horsepower, with 84 horsepower.</p>
<p>The Marmon automobile engine is suitable for large cylinders. Marmon engineers have carefully modified it through years of field testing, resulting in today's most exquisite mechanical movement, excellent power-to-weight ratio, high speed, and quiet operation. The new Marmon four types of automobiles in 1930 are inexpensive and of good quality, and have now arrived in Shanghai. You are welcome to visit and test drive the car, which is currently managed by the Shanghai Haifeng Automobile Company.</p>

<p>The Number of Automobiles in Various Countries is Increasing, and the Automobile Industry in the United States is Advancing Rapidly. The United States has always ranked first in the world for the number of automobiles domestically. In recent years, the number of automobiles in other countries has also been increasing. According to last year's statistics, excluding the United States, the total number of licensed automobiles in the world has increased by 16.5% compared to the previous year. There are now four countries with more than one million automobiles. The total number of automobiles, trucks, and long-distance automobiles in the world is an astonishing 32 million. The place with the fewest automobiles in the world is the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific, with only two automobiles. In terms of population ratio, excluding the United States, New York ranks second, with an average of one automobile for every nine people. Canada ranks third, with a maximum of one car for every nine people. As for the large number of automobiles in the United States, it accounts for 77% of the world's total, and its production accounts for 83.5% of the world's output because Europe only produced 600,000 automobiles last year.</p>
<p>Five Commissioners Go to the United States to Investigate Road Administration. Recently, more and more countries have sent commissioners to the United States to investigate road administration. Commissioners from Manila, Germany, Austria, Japan, and Finland have successively come to the United States to investigate road construction systems and automobile development plans in order to improve transportation. In addition, the United States' road administration tax, automobile donations, and vehicle management methods are also complete and unparalleled, and are what commissioners from various countries want to study.</p>
<p>News of Road Construction in South America. Mr. Rice, Associate of the American General Motors Company, recently returned from investigating road administration in various South American countries. According to him, the roads in major cities have mostly become accessible in all directions in the past four years, and there are also roads in the deep forests. Last year, South American countries convened a road administration conference to discuss methods of connecting main roads.</p>
<p>Long-Distance Automobile Travel in Chile. Three Chilean automobile enthusiasts traveled by car from Lima for 1,800 miles. Only a small part of the area they passed through had roads, and the rest were high mountains or wilderness. It took 35 days to reach their destination.</p>
