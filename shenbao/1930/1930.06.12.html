<p>窮礦工之子師範大學出身的勞倫斯在脱離了枯燥的教師生活從事於文學創作之後發表了他的處女作（白孔雀）（ＴheＷhiteＰeacrck）立刻引起了文藝界底贊賞和讀書界底注意個是隨着這本書有一個流言説作者是生着肺癆病没有多少時候可以活的因此在那時候勞倫斯底最引人注意的特點就是他的肺癆病和他的短促的生命這二者不必説是引起了無數讀者對於作者的同情的但這據説不久於人世的病弱的少年天才却居然竭力和死神肉搏經過了十八九年的鬥爭方才屈服這實在是當時對他不勝憫惜的人所萬没有料到的了不過勞倫斯始終不是一個健康的人他的病不但使他的肉體受苦而且使他的精神受影響這種影響在他的作品裏很可以看得出來肺癆病者所有的特殊的敏感苦悶冀望和熱情在他的作品裏都可以看到像他那樣的異常的精神和心理感覺和情緒是使我們不能不想到肺癆病患者的　　文學家之與肺癆病爲緣的自來很多即在英國如基茨（Ｋeots）司蒂芬生（Ｒ·Ｌ·Ｓtevenson）等都是很出名的肺癆病文學家但勞倫斯却和他們不同基茨司蒂芬生等是竭力把他們的病患和著作分開的換句話説他們是竭力不使他們的病在他們的著作裏露出痕跡來的勞倫斯則不然他的病和他的著作是混而爲一無從分析他所寫的人物所寫的心理所寫的世界都是他在肺癆病者底心情用了肺癆病者底眼光寫了出來的　　勞倫斯在去世以前的幾年之内因爲身體底關係大多住在暖和的南歐和南美｜意大利法蘭西墨西哥等日光的影響在他後期的作品裏很容易發現他身體中的</p>

<p>似乎響應了南國底日光而且是猛烈地熱情地響應因此他彷彿把日光看作人生應走之路的象徴在他看來日光就是光明底象徴壯健底象徴自由底象徴享樂底象徴這是因爲他這幾年來日漸覺得西方人底現代生活太灰色太（違反日光）了而没有日光的生活就是衰敗和死亡所以他在去年出版的詩集（思想集）（Ｐansies不幸這是他最後的一部作品）裏曾説過過這樣的話（良心者就是承認日光之存在的感覺和不違反日光的本能）這狂放乖特的勞倫斯到了晚年無疑地是成了（歸向自然）的主唱者他悲悼着原始生活之消逝物質文明之猖獗和禮教束縛之嚴酷而人類生活之日漸灰色和機械化人類情慾之日漸銷沉和被壓抑是使他看了覺得無限抑鬱的因此他對於那種自由自在的光明快樂的本能的與原始的生活是不禁要不勝悵望了　　勞倫斯底這種心情精看似很突兀但我們如果知道了他的歷史和境地就不會覺得詫異了勞倫斯早年的生活是在英國度去的他生於英國南部工業區域的Ｍidland他周圍的世界是陰森的煤礦貪狠的人物灰色的天空他的父親是一個窮苦的礦工他讀不了幾年書就脱離學校也做礦工去但這聰明好學的青年是不甘於過這種生活的後來因了鄉間教師西蒙先生底介紹到一個師範大學去做免費生畢業後在倫敦教了三年書但但這也不是他所願幹的事業於</p>

<p>即獸性的方面了我們把肉體底慾求附屬於心靈的品性尊靈而卑肉却不知道靈是不配坐第一把交椅的他旣有這種哲學思想他的作品對於性心理和性慾當然是有不少的描寫了這樣的事情在紳士氣和道學氣很濃重的英國社會裏當然是新奇而且大胆的但雖然是引起了不少的輕蔑和斥責這無名的青年作家到底是一鳴驚人了第二部作品接踵出版題名（違犯者）（ＴheＴrespasser）格調思想是和第一部完全一樣的但是這部書很少有人談起不過從風格底完美和形式底盡善上看來這却可以算是勞倫斯作品中技巧最好的一部他的第三部長篇小説（兒子們與戀人們）（ＳonsandLovers是被許多批評家認爲他的最好的作品其中有幾段寫得很優美很有力這部作品底發表使他的聲譽增高了許多（虹）（TheRaiubow）是他的第四部小説也是他的第一部被禁的作品到現在這本小説還不能在英國公然出賣（虹）一出版就被官廳禁止這是勞倫斯第一次和法律衝突但這時候的勞倫斯還不是一個有顯明意識的反抗現代文明的叛徒因爲他自己作品之被禁似乎是出于他的意料之外而使他大吃一驚的因此他竟沉默了一些時候不敢發表什麽直到四年以後他才發表了第五部小説（失去的女郎）（ＴheＬostＧirl）這時在叙述上是謹愼了許多但在宣傳他的見解上却激烈了許多尤其是很大胆地推崇肉慾觀念他以爲戀愛應以肉慾爲本位假使我們大家都明白這一層我們就可以得救了從這一部小説起他到了他的第二時期他在第二時期所發表的小説都是些大胆猛烈的東西如（戀愛中的女人）（ＷameninＬove）（亞倫底杖）（Ａaron'sＲod）（騎馬而去的女人）（ＴheWomanWhoRodeＡway）以及那在巴黎私自出版的（却脱萊夫人底情人）（ＬadyoＣhatteiley'sＬover）等　　勞倫斯底作品是愈到後期愈傾向於宣傳他的思想因此也愈疏忽了藝術所以他的藝術最完美的小説還是他早年所作的兒子们與戀愛人们他的詩也是如此前期所寫的詩集（鳥獸花卉）（ＢirdsＢeastsandＦlowers）何等優美敏鋭而最後所發表的（思想集）却又何等粗率枯躁所以從思想上看雖然是後者有價值而從藝術上看時却是前者佔勝了（思想傳）與其説是一卷詩不如説是一本雜感錄　　我們如果純從詩的觀點來看（思想集）是没有什麽價值時但我們如果撇開了詩底外形而注意内中的思想那這本東西就不但有價值而且極有意味了至於其中的思想當然是十足地（勞倫斯的）的大致可以説是如此｜世界是已經陳腐了混亂了腥臭了祗有鷄零狗碎的淫蕩没有長篇大幅有熱情祗有徒然的空談没有積極的行爲總而言之這個世界是没有條理没有精神没有情慾的了</p>

<p>學桃戲劇運動的意義與效能簡單的説是要使生活戲劇化起來在我們中國的學校生活那是誰都感覺到的太呆板·枯澀·單調·無意義了死沉沉的氣壓只見到民族性的一天一天萎靡下去或趕上墮落的路所以我們不得不借文藝的力量作爲喚醒他們意志的材料興奮振作認識人生光明的大道努力追求事業的成就毁滅一切的世紀病態　　自從新藝術形態的戲劇在中國估定了牠的地位以後學校戲劇運動便有了一個特殊的進展以前是幼稚的文明戲式的感情衝動的表現現在是形而上學的改進生活的新的藝術的探求尤其最近二年來的開拓我們看了學校戲劇運動史值得我們驚奇各學校的劇社雨後春筍地標幟起來不但大學連中學都在紛紛組織女同學們也解放了閨秀的尊貴犧牲着一同跑向藝術之宫有能力的便單獨舉行公演力量單薄的參加在游藝會内他們的精神與毅力我們當致相當的敬禮　　這是於事實上的考察而關於理論的探討與宣傳也夠十分努力不能抺殺了的因此我們更可知道學校戲劇運動是益深進了一個階段在敎育上獲得相當的讚譽本來戲劇的力量是給人以力給人以教育給人以娱樂給人以生活的方法的青年時期正是一朶青春之花開放得鮮麗的時候我們要是使好完美起來站在時代的前驅積極的奮鬥的前進的把他們的熱情與沸血運用在正當的地方這便是戲劇所要感化他們的戲劇的步驟可分爲三個段落一是選擇脚本二是排演三是搬上舞台旣然我們最大的對象是要給予青年人以活的動力那末我們第一步所要注意的便該是劇本了我們所要應用的劇本絶對須避免低級趣味的陳型和階級意思的錯誤觀念而適合怎樣來我們民族以新的生命換句話説我們所要求的是怎樣來健全（民族底意識）有了好的劇本才能表現出好的戲求予人深刻的印象｜同情感動彷彿這些事是我自己的經歷似的　　現在各學校的劇團雖則有不少是了解了的然而也是不少没有抓住了新藝術形態的戲劇甚至淪落於錯誤的路上這點我們但觀各劇團公演所公佈的脚本已可知道固然在中國尚缺少好的劇本但譯自外國的好的劇本也屢不少最大的毛病是專爲某一種思想的宣傳而失却戲劇的價值我以爲大不爲然的因此我對於學校戲劇底劇本的選擇發表一點意見　　（一）戲劇在民族運動中佔有很大的力量牠鼓勵民族的獨立精神的現在正是我們自求民族獨立的時代過去我們的民族精神太消沈了現在我們要重新發揚振作起來在思想情感志趣風俗人情環境都須注着使青年不忘其未來的使命　　（二）是推進的教育的使他們體騐人生認識世間以豐富的内容使他們了然於人生各種不同的外像及人性中的典型性也是解説的指引的使他們忘去所謂難與易不作無謂的怒吼不作無謂的哀吟勇敢地大踏步向光明的大道上行走向上前進　　這是學校劇所需要的劇本希望努力學校戲劇運動的同學們共同起來討論和指導各學校劇團對劇本之選擇這是件不可疏忽的工程要是我們的學校戲劇普遍地開展（李椿森）</p>

<p>Nanjing: Chiang issued a proclamation to the citizens of Hunan Province, stating that Zhang Fkui, Bai Chongxi, Tang Zhiming, and other rebels, leading their defeated remnants, have once again invaded your Hunan Province. The Central Army is temporarily luring the enemy deep for strategic reasons, in order to wipe them out in one fell swoop. The crimes of Zhang Gui and other rebels are numerous and they are walking right into a trap. They still do not know that their end is near and are still trying to requisition supplies and extort money from you, doing their utmost to indulge their bestial desires. Now, the 4th, 6th, 8th, and 9th Route Armies have already advanced towards Changsha by separate routes, and warships and planes will also converge to surround and capture the enemy one by one. The order in Hunan Province will definitely be restored within ten days, and the remnants of the Zhang Gui rebellion that are causing disturbances in Hunan will definitely be completely annihilated. Compatriots, Hunan compatriots under the banner of the revolution, I advise you to endure the temporary pain and not to panic or be afraid, and never submit to Zhang Gui's tyrannical power. Do not use the money and food earned with your blood and sweat to supply the rebel army and prolong their life of evil. If you supply the rebel army with money and food, it is tantamount to inviting the enemy to provide for the bandits, and the Central Army will punish you according to the law. Compatriots, your savior is at hand! Endure some pain and unite to annihilate the remnants of the rebellion and complete the National Revolution! (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e6">Opening of the International Labour Conference <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The International Labour Conference is established to seek the improvement of various labour causes internationally. With respect to this year's labour conditions, it is even more imperative to pay attention to one specific point. All countries today are in a situation of commercial depression; the factories' business power is unable to maintain, then the labour sector will naturally suffer a blow. Industrial nations' governments and their capitalists would want to revitalise their industry to reverse the decline, yet the policies they take are often only beneficial to the capital side and do not spare a moment for the labour cause. The current restructuring, such as rationalisation in various countries, all contain such meaning. The result is that the capitalists may certainly gain profits, but the labour sector has not really been able to rest, then it is not a long-term plan. At this time of world trade difficulty, the capital side certainly receives impact, but the suffering felt by labour is even greater. If the capital side wants to cast off the crisis in order to maintain its interests, it must also maintain the interests of the labourer. If the labour side wants to maintain one line of life in this crisis, it cannot rely solely on the capital side for help, but also must work with them with one mind in order to seek a way of co-existence. This is what the conference should pay attention to today. The mining work problem is certainly very important, but viewing the current situation, every industry is in an important time. As the government representatives, they must weigh between labour and capital, pay attention to one side of the methods of protecting labour and one side of maintaining industry. As the labour and employer representatives, they must think about how to be in the same boat together in order to cross this urgent trend. Today's conference is already set up for the labourer, then in name and in fact it should urgently seek happiness for labour and cannot solely plan for the capital side in order to deprive the labourer's interests. This is what all representatives deeply know and does not need to be troubled by words. Furthermore, I have more to say, the International Labour Conference has already opened fourteen times, the achievements have not been particularly remarkable. Our nation's representatives only began to join recently the past two years, they must certainly strive to seek the improvement of national treatment, so that our nation's labourers abroad receive actual equal treatment, so that they do not betray the nation's expectations.

<h3 id="e10">Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Declaration <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Should Be Recalled by Government Funding</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a declaration on the 11th, stating that it had received reports that the Shanghai Concession authorities planned to solicit bids for the concession's telephone service, with the winning bidder taking over and operating it, granting them a monopoly for 40 years and allowing them to increase telephone charges until the annual net profit equals a certain percentage of the invested capital. Recently, there has also been news that the International Telephone and Telegraph Company has already won the bid. The Ministry found that the Shanghai China Foreign Telephone Company has always been a Chinese-foreign joint venture, with Chinese shares accounting for about 60 percent. This time, the Concession authorities wanted to hand over the existing equity of Chinese businessmen to foreign businessmen for purchase, disregarding the seizure of Chinese businessmen's enterprises and granting them to foreign businessmen, which is unfair. Furthermore, granting the purchasing company a monopoly period of up to 40 years is even more unknown on what basis. The Chinese government should therefore specifically declare that any method of selling the China Foreign Telephone Company to foreign businessmen cannot be recognized. As for this issue and subsequent solutions, the only way is to recall it with government funding, because telephone services in all parts of China, whether in Chinese or Concession areas, should be operated by China itself. For example, the telephone services in the Tianjin and Hankou Concessions were initially founded by foreign businessmen, but were later recalled and operated, and their performance is far better than the Shanghai Concession's telephone service. If the telephone service is operated by the government, it can take into account the interests of all the people and will not be operated by merchants solely for profit. According to the International Telephone and Telegraph Company's budget, the annual net profit is calculated at 12.5 percent of the invested capital. Therefore, the telephone charges will be increased by 35 percent, which will only increase the burden on the people and is not a fair way. In addition to sending telegrams to the relevant ministers to instruct the consuls in Shanghai to accept the Chinese side's proposals for sincere consultation in order to reach a quick conclusion, this declaration is hereby issued.

<p>The Ministry of Communications in Nanjing states that postage rates for parcels mailed from China to the United States are handled according to the Sino-U.S. parcel exchange agreement.  The collected postage, after direct payment of transportation costs, involves mutual forwarding between China and the U.S. without any handling fees. However, due to the high value of gold and low value of silver, the national currency postage collected for parcels sent to the U.S. is only two-thirds of the original rate when converted to gold dollars, or even less, resulting in significant losses. Therefore, the rates are being revised. The postage for parcels from China to the United States and the Philippines will be 36 cents in national currency per pound or fraction thereof, and 75 cents for parcels to U.S. territories, to alleviate the losses. The changes take effect on July 1st. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese Navy Ministry Announces</p>
<h3 id="e44">Minister of Military Command Dismissed <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The post is succeeded by Tanimoto Naoshin. The Privy Council is dissatisfied with the Minister of Navy's actions.  Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 11th: Minister of Military Command Kato entered the palace yesterday morning to meet with the Japanese Emperor. He detailed the results of the Military Council meeting, the contents of the memorandum drafted by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Navy, and the uneasiness felt regarding the national defense plan due to the London Treaty, saying that he had failed in his duty to assist and requested to resign from his post. Therefore, Minister Kato's resignation was quickly realized. Minister of Finance visited the Japanese Emperor at 4:00 pm in response to the Emperor's summoning. After Kato's request to resign was submitted in detail, Kato's intention to resign was also stated, so the question of the resignation of the Minister of Military Command will be approved by the Japanese Emperor in the next day or two. His successor will be General Tanimoto Naoshin, the current commander of the Wu Naval Base, and Vice Admiral Nomura Yoshi Saburo, the commander of the Training Fleet, will succeed the commander of the Wu Naval Base. The reason why the resignation issue of the Minister of Military Command took a sharp turn for the worse is directly related to the government's desire to resolve the matter before the ratification of the military reduction treaty. Although the national defense replenishment plan is currently being drafted by Minister of Military Command Kato, the cost is huge and cannot be recognized by the current financial status. If the government and the military department were to have a head-on collision over the plan, it would be inevitable. If the Minister of Military Command is replaced and a new plan is drafted under the new Minister of Military Command, it would be even more difficult. Therefore, in order to smooth the approval procedures and financial relations, the Minister of Military Command was quickly replaced. The Minister of Finance visited the Prime Minister's official residence yesterday afternoon to explain to Prime Minister Hamaguchi, Bihara, Adachi, Ek, and other cabinet members that he himself, as the signatory of the London Treaty, had made various efforts to avoid disputes between the government and the military department, and the ins and outs of the replacement of the Minister of Military Command. The government regards the replacement of the Minister of Military Command as entirely an internal matter of the navy in order to avoid rumors that there is a political understanding behind the issue and decided to leave the matter to the Minister of Navy. Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 11th: Regarding the resignation of the Minister of Military Command Kato, Minister of Finance summoned Matsushita, the director of the Personnel Bureau, to his private residence at 7:30 this morning to discuss the result for a period of time and decided to submit it to the Japanese Emperor for approval. Immediately afterwards, the Navy Ministry announced that Navy General Kato Kanji, Minister of Military Command, was dismissed from his post and appointed military aide. Navy General Tanimoto Naoshin, commander of the Wu Naval Base, was dismissed from his post and appointed Minister of Military Command. The Navy changes accompanying the Minister of Military Command's replacement will be held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 1:00 pm by Prime Minister Hamaguchi as Tanimoto is not in the palace at his current post. In addition, Vice Admiral Nomura Yoshi Saburo of the Navy Ministry of Military Command was dismissed from his post and appointed Commander of the Wu Naval Base. Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 11th: Due to the replacement of the Minister of Military Command, various parties are paying close attention to the actions of the Minister of Finance himself. The Navy believes that the Minister of Finance will not resign to take responsibility because of the resignation of the Minister of Military Command and is currently determined to remain in his post and work hard to eliminate the barriers between the government and the military department and seek to adequately supplement the deficiencies in national defense. However, the Privy Council is mostly dissatisfied with the actions of the Minister of Navy since the Military Council, especially the advance and retreat of the Minister of Military Command, who is in charge of the tent agency, has troubled the Emperor. The responsibilities of assisting in the responsibility are extremely important, and the Screening Committee has decided to seriously correct the situation.</p>

<p>The steel industry has been approved, and the coal mining industry will follow. It is widely believed that this move will enable the industry to return to prosperity. Reuters, Berlin, 10th: The German Minister of Labor today implemented the first step to reduce wages in order to suppress prices. In response to the employer's request, the Minister announced that the wage dispute ruling, which is beneficial to the West German steel company and not recognized by the labor union, is enforceable. The ruling reduces wages by just over 7%. The industry is responsible for reducing the sales price of its products accordingly, that is, the price of iron is reduced by about 3 to 4 marks per ton. It is heard that the Ruhr coal industry is also preparing to adopt a price reduction policy when miners' wages are reduced. It is widely believed that this policy can enable general industries at home and abroad to return to prosperity. It is also reported that on May 30, the Minister of Labor stated that the parliament needs to raise 200 million marks to subsidize the existing 2 million unemployed workers in Germany.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 10th: The German Minister of Labor has approved a 7.25% wage cut in the steel industry today. Although the labor union strongly opposed it, it was ineffective. However, there is also an understanding on the employer's side that the steel price must be reduced by the equivalent amount one month before implementation in exchange. The outside world welcomes the Labor Department's move as the first step in lowering prices and promoting industry. It is now reported that if the mining industry can reach a compromise, wages and prices will also be reduced accordingly.  Luo Xinwang</p>

<p>The Minister to France did not dare to return to the country after being dismissed. French newspapers comment on the new political situation in Romania. Guomin News Agency, Budapest, 10th: After the capital of Romania has been shrouded in a curtain of silence since Monday, it has not yet been lifted, but according to news from the border, the new king has ordered former Prime Minister Maineau to form a cabinet. Mr. Maineau intends to form a cabinet of talented people, but there are many obstacles and he may still use his own party to govern. The Liberal Party is strongly advocating that the new king dissolve the parliament and hold new elections to see the public opinion, but it is heard that the king does not seem to approve of this move. Guomin News Agency, Paris, 10th: The Romanian Minister to France, Daya Mendeti, was immediately dismissed and recalled after the new King Carol took office, but in recent days, there have been rumors in political circles that Mr. Mendeti fears that the new king will revive old grievances and will stay in France and not comply with the order to return to the country. When Mr. Carol was deposed and exiled as crown prince, Mr. Mendeti often sent people to tail and monitor him, and his expulsion from Britain was also due to Mr. Mendeti's activities, so there is a deep-seated feud between the two. At present, French newspapers still have lengthy comments on the Romanian political situation, and they all expect that the new king's policy of appeasement has eliminated the difficulties of division and that many difficulties have arisen, and they are also speculating about the new dynasty's foreign policy. The free press of the Radical Party claims that there are already many political vortexes in Europe, and the return of Carol has added another one. The French Line News, the organ of the royalist party, goes even further, claiming that Europe is now tumultuous on all sides, and treaty vows are insufficient to restrain it. The humanitarian newspaper of the Communist Party claims that the French government and generals are actually secretly helping Mr. Carol to return to the country to become one of the main figures in the anti-communist movement. Also, a Swiss newspaper reported that the plan for the new Romanian king to return to the country was actually planned in Switzerland. On April 24, after Mr. Carol went from Zurich to Bain Chalena, he secretly discussed with famous Romanian politicians all night long. Afterwards, the politicians hurriedly left the country, and Mr. Carol also returned to Zurich. Indian newspapers still hold</p>

<p>Expresses dissatisfaction with the Simon Commission report. Resolutions of the Kuomintang Standing Committee. Reuters, Bombay, 10th: Indian independent newspapers still take a rejecting attitude towards the report of the Simon Commission. The Bombay Exchange Newspaper refers to this report as insulting to India, and the Indian Daily Mail compares this report to undercooked rice flour cake, which has a very radical ginger and cinnamon flavor. Even the so-called moderate Indians criticize it a lot. Sir Sezina, a member of the Executive Council of the Indian government, predicts that the recommendations given to India by the commission will be the minimum and will keep India in the hands of the British forever. In addition, Sir Sethalfa, a lawyer at the Bombay High Court, also predicts that the Simon Commission's recommendations will not be able to satisfy India's national aspirations. However, European newspapers said that the investigation committee unanimously agreed to this report, which is a good omen, and praised the report for its comprehensiveness. Reuters, 10th: The Indian Governor Owen will deliver a speech to the Indian Legislative Council on July 9. Reuters, Allahabad, 10th: The Standing Committee of the Kuomintang met for four days and decided to ask the people of the country to cope with the situation created by the decrees issued by the Indian Governor prohibiting boycott picketing, prohibiting refusal to pay taxes, and prohibiting inciting government personnel. The Standing Committee believes that government officials have participated in unreasonable attacks, and the people of the country should reject them in society, and the local scope of the non-payment of taxes movement should also be expanded. The Standing Committee stated that newspapers that voluntarily undertake to draft articles refuting the above-mentioned decrees and disseminate the views of the Kuomintang Congress may be allowed to continue publishing; otherwise, their publication will be suspended.

Guomin News Agency, Washington, 10th: The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee passed a proposal today to state to the State Department that the President does have the right to refuse to hand over secret documents regarding the London Naval Conference negotiations, but stated that most members of the committee could not express sympathy for this move, so in this situation, according to the committee's opinion, the committee can review all documents regarding the Naval Treaty. Finally, it was said that this proposal is only a statement of opinion on one side of the committee and should be submitted to the Senate for any action to be taken. According to Mr. Bora, the chairman of the committee, the only way to force the President to hand over the documents is to propose impeachment, and he also said that based on the trend in the Senate, the Naval Treaty can be passed without major obstacles. Given such a powerful force, it seems that the move to force Mr. Stimson to hand over all secret documents is no longer a problem.</p>

<p>From now on, the Russians will be able to devote all their efforts to managing Central Asia. World News Agency: The recently opened Turkestan-Siberian Railway (abbreviated as Turbsib in Western languages) in the Soviet Union has attracted great attention internationally and is especially important to the defense of our country's northwest border. The American reporter Mr. Yun Yong wrote a brief article, saying that after the completion of the Turkestan-Siberian Railway (hereinafter referred to as the Turkish-Siberian Railway), the Soviet government's situation and position in Asia have been greatly enhanced. The entire line extends from Samipalatinsk to Lugovaya, not far from Tashkent, for a total length of 1,442 kilometers, of which about 1,000 kilometers run parallel to China's western border. In the future, branch lines will be built between the north of this line and the Ural Mountains, and between the south of the line and the cities and towns on the Chinese border to facilitate transportation. From then on, the Soviet Union will be able to apply all its economic and military strength to Turkestan when necessary. There is no doubt that the Soviet authorities built this road with military purposes in mind, and they are constantly concerned about the outbreak of war. The last civil war in Afghanistan made the Soviet Union even more uneasy in this regard, and economic purposes are also obviously in an important position outside of military affairs, because the development of Central Asia is extremely important to Central Asia itself and the entire Soviet Union, so it is a fundamental part of the Five-Year Industrial Plan, and this plan is the goal of all Soviet policies at present. It is estimated that by next year, the Turkish-Siberian Railway will transport 1.225 million tons of goods between Siberia and Turkestan. By the fifth year, the amount of freight can be doubled. The main commodities will be bread and timber. The soil of Turkestan is suitable for growing cotton, which is urgently needed by the Soviet Union, but at present, due to inconvenient transportation, food from other places cannot be transported into Turkestan, and local farmland mostly grows miscellaneous grains. In the future, bread can be imported, and farmland can be converted to growing cotton. In addition, no less than millions of bushels of grains are currently imported into Turkestan from the Caucasus, Ukraine, and the Volga River region, and in the future, they can all be transferred to the European market. The timber imported from Siberia to Turkestan can promote various construction projects in the local area and reduce their expenses. In short, the completion of the Turkish-Siberian Railway is the first important step in making Central Asia industrialized.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Information on the Liu-Lu Conflict in Fuzhou <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The panic in the city on the 6th led to the declaration of temporary martial law starting on the 7th. Recent communications from Fuzhou indicate that the Lu Xingbang and Liu Heding divisions have dispatched troops to reinforce defenses in the northwest areas of the provincial capital, with strict deployments in place. Those unaware of the true situation in society are speculating, and rumors are spreading as if war is imminent, causing considerable unrest. Unexpectedly, at noon on the 6th of this month, a platoon of Liu's troops chased two young men in short clothes from Gulou Street towards Ximen Street, capturing them in front of the Dingyuan Bridge at the Xiaoyoutian Restaurant. They were then escorted towards the North Gate. During the chase, pedestrians scattered, and shops on both sides closed. The impact led to a complete market shutdown in the southwest streets. Personnel from various agencies, suspecting a disturbance, also dispersed in a frenzy, causing temporary chaos in the local order. Upon hearing the news, the Municipal Public Security Bureau urgently dispatched security police to maintain order and persuaded shops to reopen. By around 1:00 PM, the situation had returned to normal. Regarding the captured individuals, some say they were deserters, others say they were spies, and there are reports that they were detained by the division headquarters or executed, but the actual situation remains unclear. However, since this incident, society has become somewhat uneasy, with residents in the northwest particularly panicked. Starting in the afternoon, people began to relocate, carrying boxes and bundles, helping the elderly and children, in a continuous stream. Those who did not relocate heavily purchased firewood and rice and exchanged silver dollars in preparation for emergencies, causing the price of rice to suddenly increase by more than one yuan per stone and the price of silver dollars to rise by two copper coins per dime. To maintain local order, the provincial government convened a joint military-political meeting at 3:00 PM on the 6th, attended by provincial government members Chen Peikun, Jiang Pingfan, Lin Jinan, Marine Corps Headquarters Chief of Staff Yang Tingying, 56th Division Chief of Staff Wang Jicheng, Provincial Defense Commander Lin Zhong, Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief Guo Yongrong, Water Police Bureau Chief Shen Ke, and others. It was decided to declare temporary martial law starting on the 7th, with traffic halted from 11:00 PM at night (but military and security areas such as Hongshan Bridge outside Ximen and Ma'anshan Township outside Beimen would have traffic halted from 9:00 PM at night). Tea houses, restaurants, theaters, brothels, and other public places would cease operations from 10:00 PM at night. Inspections of ships, hotels, mail, and telegrams would be conducted, and gatherings and associations would be prohibited, with the aim of apprehending rumor-mongers, agitators, reactionary spies, and troublemakers to suppress public anxiety. At the same time, fearing that rumors would confuse right and wrong, Chen Jiliang telegraphed Lu Xingbang, the commander of the Yanping division, requesting his cooperation in maintaining the overall situation. The recent deployments of the Liu and Lu divisions seem to be particularly focused on the Hongshan Bridge outside Ximen, with Wang Tianrui's regiment of the Lu division stationed west of the bridge and Yan Ximin's regiment of the Liu division stationed east of the bridge.

<h3 id="e60">Recent Developments in the Battle on the Longhai Railway Line <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: After the Longhai Railway line battle transitioned from mobile warfare to trench warfare, the two sides have been deadlocked for over ten days. The enemy army has focused on night attacks on both flanks. Recently, on the evening of the 8th, the enemy army again launched a surprise attack from the side towards the Central Army's position but was repelled. The Central Army has broken through the enemy's defenses in sections. According to news from the front, the enemy forces north and south of the Longhai Railway line are deployed on the left and right sides. The left side, led by the Jin Army as the main force, extends from the south bank of the Yellow River to the south of Lanfeng, under the command of Xu Yongchang and Sun Chu at the front line. The right side, led by the Feng Army as the main force, extends from the south of the Longhai Railway line to the south of Qi County, under the command of Lu Zhonglin and Sun Liangcheng at the front line. On the outer side of the Jin Army on the left is Sun Guangqian's division and Liu Chunrong's division under Shi Yousan, while on the outer side of the Feng Army on the right is Zheng Dazhang and Zhang Deshun's cavalry and a part of Song Zheyuan's force. However, they are experiencing extreme supply shortages, and the Central Army is encircling them. He Yaozu told reporters yesterday that Lanfeng and Kaifeng would be resolved within about a week. Currently, enemy generals Lu Zhonglin is in Kaifeng, Xu Yongchang in Lanfeng, and Sun Liangcheng in Qi County, attempting a final struggle (June 9th).</p>
<p>Guide Correspondence: The intensity of the current battle on the Longhai Railway line is unprecedented. The area around Lanfeng is littered with corpses, and the situation is no less tragic than the Battle of Longtan. On the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th, the enemy army launched full-scale attacks, but the Central Army responded calmly. Initially, they did not fire a single shot, waiting until the enemy forces charged to within about ten steps before machine guns and mortars unleashed a barrage, causing the enemy forces to fall like dominoes without a single survivor. Therefore, in the past four or five days, the Central Army suffered only over a thousand casualties, while the enemy army lost almost all of its elite troops, with countless killed and wounded. In terms of corpses alone, there are over 20,000. Since the start of the battle, the Central Army has only advanced and has never retreated a single step. The battle line is about five miles from Lanfeng, and the two sides are currently in a stalemate, but our left and right wings have completely encircled Lanfeng, trapping the enemy like turtles in a jar. According to reliable sources, the Central Army's fatalities from the start of the operation until now are less than 2,000, but there are more wounded, especially those with minor injuries. These wounded soldiers are being handled at the front by the wounded soldier inspection teams, so there are no problems, but once they are transported to the rear, management becomes a problem. The day before yesterday (7th), Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally returned to Xuzhou to inspect the wounded soldier hospitals at Jiulishan and other locations specifically for this matter. He immediately issued an order to the logistics director, Yu Feipeng, and the wounded soldier inspectors to have all wounded soldiers transported from the front disembark in Guide for inspection to distinguish between severe and minor injuries before arranging for their resettlement. It is reported that yesterday, logistics director Yu Feipeng, chief of the commander-in-chief's guard Wang Shihe, wounded soldier inspector Xue Jihong from the commander-in-chief's headquarters, director Shen of the field medical office, and the heads of various wounded soldier hospitals met at the field headquarters to discuss the arrangements. They decided to establish a field law enforcement office, mobilizing the guard brigade and military police regiment to organize it. From now on, all wounded soldiers will disembark in Guide, where medical officers from various hospitals will inspect them. Those with severe injuries will be given passes to notify the transportation command to prepare vehicles for transportation to the rear, while those with minor injuries will no longer be transported to the rear. A team will be dispatched to strictly inspect each departure, and anyone without a pass will not be allowed to board to prevent difficulties in the rear. This matter is now being implemented by the wounded soldier inspection team in conjunction with the relevant agencies (June 9th).</p>

<h3 id="e62">Opposition to the Restoration of the Zhalan Coal Mine <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Restoration Must Wait Until Next Year. Harbin Correspondence, 4th. Regarding the restoration of the Zhalanor coal mine, the board of directors of the Chinese Eastern Railway, jointly instructed the Railway Bureau, to expedite the matter. The Railway Bureau, after receiving the order, delayed its implementation and recently submitted a response to the board of directors stating that there were various difficulties in restoring the mine and that it would not be possible until next year. The board of directors is currently treating this as an outstanding issue that must await the return of Mo Dehui for a formal meeting to resolve. The general contents of the Russian Bureau's original report are as follows: (The work of restoring operations, which began in January of this year, involved extracting and transporting new coal from trenches. The pre-prepared coal reserve of 20,000 tons was completed on May 15th of this year. During the work period, the remaining paving, property, buildings, and technical documents and mining plans in the mining area were examined for research material. Most importantly, mining in the tunnels is not necessary and has very little benefit. It is not because the No. 9 coal tunnel was flooded. If underground work is to be restored, all equipment will not only take time but also cost money, which is equivalent to reopening a new tunnel. It is better to work from open trenches, which is more convenient for transportation. For future underground work, new coal tunnels will have to be opened. Because this involves large sums of money, it is better to mine from open coal trenches. Last year's experiment with coal mined from open coal trenches was quite suitable. As for the planning and restoration work funds, the coal mining period and the coal produced must be thoroughly assessed. For now, only the No. 2 coal mining area of the new coal tunnel is delineated, divided into two sections. The first section is estimated to contain about 700,000 tons of mineable coal, and the second section is estimated to contain about 2 million tons of reserve coal. These estimated quantities are based on reports from the mine's technical personnel and have no accurate data for reference. After the mine was burned, all the boundaries of coal production, the edges of the coal area, the calculation of the amount of coal mined, and the coal quality of each area were completely lost, with no records available. If implemented based on speculation, the water in each flooded coal area must be treated first. Before work can begin, a power plant must be built and pumps purchased, requiring approximately 250,000 rubles. In addition to the cost of laying track and removing soil from the open trenches, the cost of the first 64,000 tons of coal mined has exceeded 919,000 rubles. In summary, the Railway Bureau should allocate this huge sum of money based on the possibility of exploring and mining the coal seams. It must have a clear grasp before allocating the funds for equipment such as power plants and pumps; otherwise, there may be changes that contradict the plan. Furthermore, the area of the coalfield and the thickness of the coal seams should be thoroughly reviewed. Therefore, the Railway Bureau intends to handle the following plan: (1) A report on all the costs of mining approximately 20,000 tons of coal from the open trench will be submitted shortly. (2) During the period when the coal mine is not in operation, all vacant houses will be preserved, and old and broken parts such as boilers and machines will be dismantled. Technical buildings and other useless items will be inventoried. This work will require 32,000 rubles, with 27,000 yuan for dismantling old machines and 4,000 rubles for preservation, from June to December 1930, a total of seven months. It is also found that all the old machines and materials of the mine are valued at approximately 48,000 rubles. This expense will be listed under the item of the severance of diplomatic relations between China and Russia and will be undertaken to explore and mine the coal blocks in the first and second sections listed above. Exploring the coal seams is costly. Because future coal mining will be based on the planned coal seams, the timing of this work will depend on when the mining beds and all equipment are purchased abroad. It takes several months for such tools to be shipped from abroad. If there are no goods in stock abroad and pre-orders are made, it will take even longer. Based on this, the earliest that exploration and mining of coal seams can be carried out is before July of next year, and it will take until the end of the year to complete. 150 coal mining drills will be needed. After the coal seams have been explored, the amount of reserve coal in the first and second coal areas and its coal quality will be studied based on the exploration data. During the exploration period, attention should be paid to measuring the area of the coal seams and the thickness of the coal seam. If the work of exploring the coal seams is actively carried out, it will not be officially started until the beginning of 1931 at the earliest. In order to conserve public funds, it is planned to finalize the above work and then determine the setting up of a power plant and the installation of pumps. The purchase of this paving must be arranged by the end of the summer of 1931, and water can be pumped in early autumn, because the work procedures are too cumbersome and coal cannot be mined until the end of 1931)." The above is the report of the Russian Bureau Director. According to the document from Hua Yupu, the chief of the materials section of the Railway Bureau, to the Directorate of the Chinese Eastern Railway, it states that all old coal tunnels except for No. 9, which is too severely damaged to be easily restored, can be restored, and underground mining saves labor and money. If, as reported by the Russian Bureau Director, open trenches are opened, new beds are purchased, and new stoves are set up, the statement that excavation will begin next year is also a mere formality. The fact is that it is difficult to handle, so why bother with these extra steps? It is reported that the board of directors has also requested this report for reference at future meetings.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Trial Opens in the Case of Shenyang Postal Workers Transporting Opium <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: There were originally three cases of personnel from the Liaoning Postal Administration using postal vehicles to transport opium and narcotics. The first case involved the seizure of opium on a postal vehicle, with the offenders being Ma Cheng, Xu Zhenwu, Chen Xingqiao, and others. The second case involved the discovery of empty bags used for transporting opium, with the offenders being Shen Tianjue, Han Shuren, Zhao Guofeng, and others. The third case involved a contract to sell opium that was reported, with the offenders being Du Shichang, Zhang Fengchi, Xu Jingyi, and others. The case of Ma Cheng and others has already been legally sentenced by the local court. The cases of Shen Tianjue and Du Shichang were also opened for trial yesterday by Tang Yinfen, the presiding judge of the criminal court of the local court. As a result, since evidence still needs to be investigated, the defendants were remanded in custody pending a scheduled retrial. The following is a summary of the discovery and interrogation of the two cases:</p>
<p>Shen Tianjue Case: Shen Tianjue was the director of the second branch of the South Manchuria Station. Han Shuren and Zhao Guofeng were bag transfer personnel. The branch has always been a bag transfer point and does not send out postal bags. Shen and other staff who did not know the details used the convenience of mail not being inspected to transport opium from Rehe, Changchun, and Harbin to sell in this port for profit. On February 4, twenty-five postal bags sent from Harbin to Beiping arrived at the South Manchuria Station, and the empty bags were loaded inside. The person in charge was negligent and forgot to take them out. Shen Tianjue urgently telegraphed the Tianjin Bureau to receive the postal bags. The Tianjin Bureau found a dozen empty bags in the postal bags, which were bags used for transporting opium, and could not return them, so they packed them into other bags and transported them back for reuse. Unexpectedly, they were found by the bureau. According to Shen Tianjue's statement on the same day, he had been working at the bureau for more than three years, and the opium transportation was purely done by the bag transfer personnel, and he knew nothing about it. It was only when the postal bags were sent wrong that Zhao Guofeng and Han Shuren reported to him. He was afraid of being suspected and reported to the Deputy Postmaster and later reported to the General Bureau. He also stated that the escaped Yan Zian had no relatives or friends with him, and he did not let him go. Zhao Guofeng stated that he did not know that the postal bags were sent wrong that day, because the person in charge of the bags was Yan Zian, and he was responsible for inspection and receipt, so he could not be held responsible.</p>
<p>Du Shichang Case: Du Shichang and Zhang Fengchi both received and sent mail at the post office outside the Daxi Bianmen. Xu Jingyi was in the receiving and dispatching office of the Yingkou Post Office. The three of them used the opportunity that mail was not inspected and had a contract to transport opium, with a total of seven articles, all of which were transportation methods. The contract was exposed in 1927, and the former Postmaster questioned them but could not find any loopholes. At the end of December of the same year, someone sent an anonymous letter in English to the Postmaster, and Du Shichang was detained at the former Commercial Bureau Police Station. After a joint investigation by the Post Office and the Police Bureau, no secrets were obtained. The Post Office then leniently transferred Du Shichang and others to the Sipingjie Post Office to work. This year, due to the involvement in the Ma case, Du and others were summoned again. Du only admitted that the contract was for transporting fruits and vegetables, but looking at the wording, such as the fourth article, which states that the goods transported each time must be packed in bags, with the weight clearly marked and sealed with lead. If the weight is insufficient or the lead seal is broken, it will be returned immediately; otherwise, it will be considered complete. This proves that it was indeed a contract to transport opium. According to Du Shichang's statement on the same day, in April 1927, Hou Yaohuan in Changchun was related to his colleague Lu Shuyou and said that goods in Fengtian were very cheap and that each person could return to Changchun with a capital of 200 yuan to make a profit. Lu Shuyou, Hou Yaohuan, Du Shichang, Zhang Fengchi, and Xu Jingyi cooperated. Later, the business failed, and someone sent a black letter to the General Bureau in English, which must have been written by someone inside the bureau, or they may have seen the contract language and thought it was similar to an opium transportation contract, so they took this action. It should be known that as a postal worker, I can absolutely not transport opium. If there was opium transportation, the General Bureau would have sent someone to investigate long ago and would not have delayed it until today. Zhang Fengchi stated that the goods to be sold in the contract were vegetables, and he was the representative in charge of the contract, which was written by Du Shichang, and he did not know about it. Xu Jingyi stated that he had been working at the post office for nine years and one month. This contract was for transporting fresh goods, and he signed his name on it. The contract was signed by Du Shichang, and he had never seen it before (June 6th).</p>
<h3 id="e64">Wuhu Quick Dispatch <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Suddenly, 400 to 500 bandits were discovered in the northwest of Lujiang County. Representatives from all sectors in the local area have specially come to Wuhu to request the garrison regiment stationed in Wuhu to send troops to suppress them and have petitioned the ten-county joint defense office to take measures to prevent and stop them.</p>
<p>The Price Stabilization Committee held a meeting at the General Chamber of Commerce this afternoon. Municipal Director Shao Yizhou, County Magistrate Sun Gongming, Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief, and others attended. They resolved to purchase 20,000 piculs of foreign rice from Shanghai to supplement the people's food supply. In the future, rice sales would be limited to 100 piculs per day, and the price would be raised to 44 copper coins per liter. Furthermore, the three rice mills of Shihuangyuan, Guangbao, Tongxing, and Hunchangyuan were found to be secretly transporting rice out of Wuhu, which was intended to supplement the people's food supply in Wuhu, causing panic among the people. It was decided to immediately seal off the three rice mills and fine them for the loss of 10,000 piculs of flat-priced rice that had already been sold. Additionally, 180 piculs of rice stored in Hunchangyuan were confiscated and the owners of the rice mills were detained and sent to the Public Security Bureau. The Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation recently stated that the bandit situation in various counties is very serious, and the Anhui province has very few stationed troops. The Wuhu garrison regiment, led by Lu Xueshu, has made great efforts to suppress bandits and has maintained strict discipline. A telegram was specially sent to the Commander-in-Chief and the Nanjing Garrison Commander Gu Zhenglun, requesting permission to allow Lu's regiment to be stationed in Anhui permanently to maintain local order (10th).

<p>Long-distance Telephone Rate Reduction: The Construction Bureau announced that since the opening of the long-distance telephone service from Songjiang to Tinglin and Hougang, the fees have been too high, and the public has not been enthusiastic about using it. In order to develop business, it is announced that all long-distance calls will be reduced by five cents, effective from the 11th. County Government Follow-up: Kidnapping Bandits. The kidnapper, Pan Jingqing, a former petty bailiff in Xiaozhengdi, has repeatedly confessed in interrogation. After exposing the chief culprit Zhan, five more accomplices, including Zhu Zilong from Wujingshan, were captured. The county government specifically continued to interrogate the Pan bandit today (11th). He still gave many evasive answers and denied knowing the arrested kidnappers Liu Xiaomei and others, only admitting to hiding a box gun. He denied knowing anything about the circumstances of other local bandits using weapons to rob and provide relief to bandits. It is reported that further interrogations will be conducted in the evening, and a meeting to clear the countryside will be convened on schedule. In this county, robberies have been frequent, and those in rural areas with some wealth have moved to Songjiang to avoid disaster. The county government previously received instructions from higher authorities to organize a countryside clearing bureau to pacify the area. The county government has scheduled the 17th to convene a meeting of various agencies and impartial gentry to discuss organizational methods. It is reported that a countryside clearing general bureau will be established in the county seat, and sub-bureaus will be established in each district.</p>

<p>Chen Yiyi's Sentencing Issue: Chen Yiyi, the former Mexican consul, was sentenced by the Jiangning District Court to one year and two months in prison for fraud in connection with the falsification of passports. The charge of falsifying passports was not established. Chen appealed to the High Court, and the trial ended with the fraud charge being dropped and the charge of falsifying passports being upheld, with a sentence of one year and two months in prison. Chen again refused to accept the verdict and has filed another appeal with the Supreme Court. Suddenly, he was involved in a bribery case, and the Jiangning District Court withdrew the case for retrial. The trial ended with a sentence of six months in prison. After the verdict was delivered, Chen accepted the bribery charge without further appeal because the previous case had not yet concluded. However, he claimed that there was an error in the number of days of the sentence and submitted a written statement of reasons to the High Court. Yesterday (10th) afternoon, the High Court Procuratorate sent Prosecutor Sun Xiyan to open a hearing to investigate and calculate the number of days of detention. Jiangdu County Magistrate Accused: Jiangdu County Magistrate Chen Zhao was accused by local figures Xie Jie and others of dereliction of duty due to unfair handling of cases. They submitted a petition to the Procuratorate of the High Court requesting that personnel be dispatched to conduct a thorough investigation. After receiving the petition, the High Court Procuratorate issued an order yesterday (11th) to the Jiangdu County Court Prosecutor to investigate whether the allegations in the case were true and then review it. Third Branch Prison Chief Replaced: Since the Jiangsu Third Branch Prison on Simaqian Street has experienced repeated prison riots, the prison chief and detention center director, Shao Runfen, submitted a resignation request due to the difficulty in handling affairs. High Court President Lin has approved the request and reassigned Ding Lei, the former chief of the county Public Security Bureau Inspectorate, to succeed him. After receiving the appointment, Ding arrived at the post yesterday to assume his duties. Old Copper Coin Factory to Be Rebuilt as Branch Prison: The High Court decided to rebuild the old copper coin factory as a branch prison and sent a letter to the county government yesterday (11th) to investigate the history of the factory's buildings and land.

<p>Refugees Causing Disturbances in Rural Areas: In the past two days, a large number of refugees, six to seven hundred people, arrived in the western countryside of this county. Although the Public Security Bureaus of various places dispatched police to suppress them, they caused disturbances wherever they went, and their actions were strange and unusual theft cases occurred. For example, in the 13th district, the Xu family was robbed of decorations and money, and in the 5th district, the Hu residence was robbed of hidden items. The doors and windows were not opened, and the chests and cages were intact. No one knows how they entered. Second Agricultural Education Center Established: The Second Farmers' Education Center of this county has been established. The Education Bureau originally appointed the Preparatory Committee member Qu to serve as the director, but before the announcement could be made, Qu suddenly fell ill and died, preventing the center from opening on schedule. It is now learned that the Education Bureau has reassigned Pei Mian, a graduate of the People's College, to succeed him.</p>

<p>Water Police District Captures Notorious Robbers: Mao Mujun, the commander of the Second District of the Wuxi Water Provincial Public Security Team, recently dispatched detectives Zhou Yi and Huang Zhifang to capture two notorious robbers, Zhang Daoyin and Zhang Daochang, at 17 Xia Street, Guangfu Town, Suzhou. They were escorted to Wuxi by train yesterday for interrogation. It is reported that the two criminals were the robbers of the Renchangyuan store in Dongzhu Town, Wuxian County.</p>
<p>Extension of Time Limit for Clearing Accumulated Cases: The county government of this county previously decided that there was a large number of civil and criminal litigation cases, so County Magistrate Sun requested and was approved by the High Court to dispatch a special commissioner, Tang Yiqin, to clear the cases in Wuxi within a time limit of three months. Now, three months have expired, and a total of 170 to 80 cases have been cleared. However, a small portion of the accumulated cases has not yet been adjudicated. Yesterday, County Magistrate Sun submitted a request to the High Court to extend the time limit by one month to allow for complete clearance. Robbery Case Solved, Thieves Escorted Back to Wuxi: Xue Furui, the captain of the detective team of the Public Security Bureau of this county, reported the day before yesterday that informants Wang Bingsheng and others had reported that the leaders of the fugitives who robbed the Bashi Bridge West, Jiaoshan, and Yuxiang Bridge, Zhu Boqing, Tao Jingui, Xu Yibao, and Xu Gengsheng, had recently been surrounded and captured by the Jiangyin County Changshou Township Security. Captain Xue immediately reported to Chief Huang and forwarded the report to County Magistrate Sun of the County Government. County Magistrate Sun immediately prepared a document and ordered Captain Xue to dispatch detectives Dai Shouquan and Chen Erbo to escort the captives back to Cheng.

The police station chief sent a telegram requesting corrections to two errors of the Construction Bureau: There are many errors in the recent facilities of the Jiaxing County Construction Bureau. For example, the demolition of the southern city has been going on for two years. All the surrounding open space and the land around Nanguo have been approved by the former urban district engineering office and the demolition and construction association to separately grade and set prices for uniform marking and sale. However, the county Construction Bureau has not yet issued licenses with the county seal for the land that has been sold, so the buyers dare not build houses. Moreover, the Construction Bureau handles all the steps of local construction, from planning to facilities to completion acceptance. Outsiders dare not criticize the quality of the project. It seems that there is an element of monopoly. Zhou Guoxun, a county resident, has telegraphed the provincial government requesting a thorough review and strict order to the Jiaxing County government to pay attention to the construction.</p>

<p>Cocoon Donation Bureau Chief Accused of Overcharging: The Haining Cocoon Industry Association accused Qiu Zhenglun, the director of the Haining Cocoon Donation Bureau, of abusing his powers and using administrative penalties such as ordering the Chang'an Silk Factory to suspend work and arbitrarily fining He Tai Cocoon Bank a large sum of money, and even levying the cost of each cocoon package stamp issued by the Finance Department at five cents, creating new loopholes. Recently, it was found that cocoons transported and sold within the territory were not exempted from the donations of the three provincial public offices as in the past. His methods of collecting money can be described as meticulous. It is found that there are a total of 109 cocoon firms in Haining this year, and the dry cocoons sold to Shuangshan and Chang'an silk factories are not in the minority, and those sold to silk factories in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou also have. Although the donations of the three provincial public offices are only one angle for every hundred catties of cocoon, the total amount has reached several hundred yuan. Such private malpractice violates the party members' oath. A telegram was sent to the Zhejiang Provincial Government requesting that the Director of the Bureau be strictly ordered to return the overcharged donations of the three provincial public offices for cocoons transported and sold within the territory to the cocoon firms in order to comply with the practice and prevent embezzlement.</p>

<p>The Municipal Government has approved the registration for Fudan University's plan to expand its campus and will soon begin surveying. The existing campus of Fudan University, covering over 70 acres, has already been developed with buildings such as the Psychology Institute, Library, Gymnasium, Classrooms, Dormitories, Dining Hall, Bathhouse, and Power Room. Due to the lack of available space for additional construction, the Board of Directors resolved on January 10th of this year to acquire an additional 70+ acres of land to the east and north of the campus. An application was submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government for registration in accordance with the Land Expropriation Law. The university authorities have now received Directive No. 5647 from the Municipal Government, approving the matter to be handled in accordance with the Land Expropriation Law. Should landowners be unwilling to cooperate, they may be notified by nearby district offices according to the law. The university is now actively investigating land ownership and acreage, convening talks with local bailiffs, and commencing surveying work to proceed with land acquisition.</p>

<p>Zhang Boling requests a stipulation that every elementary school establish a sports field. Minister Jiang believes that the political situation is unstable and that there are no economic resources at this time, but he will strive to promote physical education universally within feasible limits. On the afternoon of the 10th, the reporter met Minister of Education Jiang Menglin at the Ministry. During a brief conversation, they discussed the reasons for China's disastrous defeat at the Far Eastern Games. The gist of the conversation is recorded below: Mr. Zhang Boling, the Chief Representative of China at the previous Far Eastern Games, visited the Ministry to discuss the situation of the Far Eastern Games held in Japan. The conversation was quick. Mr. Zhang suggested that physical education should be made a compulsory subject starting from elementary school, and that necessary equipment for physical education should be stipulated. Every elementary school must have a sports field, etc., which should be implemented uniformly by all schools nationwide through an order from the Ministry of Education. Mr. Zhang's proposition is undoubtedly the best way to promote physical education. However, China is now impoverished and financially strained. It is impossible to fully realize this in a short period of time. Therefore, in my view, the reasons for the failure of Chinese athletes in this Far Eastern Games are numerous, but they are all minor details. The only fundamental reason is the overall political problem in China. Without political stability in the country, nothing can be discussed. In our current situation, reactionary elements are causing disturbances everywhere, disasters are rampant, and the people are impoverished and in extreme distress. The difficulty of making a living for the people leaves no time to promote physical education. Furthermore, the lack of adequate nutrition in ordinary diets, the poor social environment, the lack of medical hygiene, and the weak productivity of the people are all directly and indirectly related to the cultivation of athletes. All these things can only be gradually improved after China's political situation stabilizes as soon as possible. At present, financial resources are stretched thin, and land prices in cities are quite high. Recently, the Ministry of Education planned to buy a piece of land nearby to build housing, which is already proving difficult. The financial capacity of each school to purchase a sports field is even more conceivable. Therefore, to hope that every elementary school is equipped with a sports field, one must first hope that the country's political situation will stabilize as soon as possible and that the social economy will develop as soon as possible. However, as long as I am in office, I will always take an active attitude and strive to promote the universality of physical education training nationwide within the possible range. The day will eventually come when China will avenge its failure in sports.

Mr. Kniř will award a first prize of a Third 52015 Ai San Ke Si brand automobile. The car will be displayed in Yiyuan for public viewing. According to Mr. Kniř, this tour is an unprecedented event in Shanghai. In addition to the Summer Play Competition, there will also be competitions in calisthenics, as follows: (1) Parallel bars, (2) Horizontal bar, (3) Gymnastics floor. The most skilled in the above skills will be awarded three silver cups, one for each item, by Mr. Kniř. Currently, Mr. Kniř has about a hundred athletes. According to the rules of this Summer Play Competition, anyone can join.

<h3 id="e99">The Youthful Life of Mussolini by Wu Pingzhong <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, who holds numerous positions, whose words are decrees, whose actions change the world, and who does not hesitate to make enemies of the world to restore Italy's former glory, is regarded by the world with astonishment as a strange character. Some of his youthful life is worth recording, so I note it below: Mussolini came from a poor background. His father was a blacksmith, and he learned the trade from him from a young age. If he made even a slight mistake, his father would not be lenient with his fists. However, Mussolini initially had no resentment and was grateful for his father's strict supervision. At the age of nine, he entered the village elementary school. He was both a student and an apprentice. Although the class divisions between rich and poor students were obvious and teachers inevitably showed prejudice, Mussolini was diligent and cheerful and did not care at all. Later, he transferred to a normal school. At that time, he was highly regarded by teachers and friends, as his literary and oratorical talents had gradually emerged. After graduating, he worked as a teacher in a small school, spending every day from morning to night with dozens of naughty children. Whenever he felt extremely bored, he would concentrate and play a few pieces of violin music to entertain himself. This man, as fierce as a tiger and with a spirit that overwhelms mountains and rivers, has a unique interest in heart-stirring music. Is this not a strange thing? Later, he lost his teaching position and joined an immigration group to seek a living far away. When he arrived in Switzerland, he ran around all day looking for work but could not find any. He was penniless, suffered from hunger and cold, and could not get enough to eat. At night, he slept in parks or broken boat cabins on the lake, and was often driven away and humiliated by the police. His difficult, wandering, and helpless life was probably what tempered his indomitable personality. Mussolini once enlisted in the army and became an Italian infantryman. He also served as the chief writer for newspapers several times, writing articles attacking the government and vigorously advocating patriotism. His sentiments were passionate and deeply moving, but his writing was too sharp and he was repeatedly arrested for being too radical. However, little did people know that the disheveled prisoner of that day would be the prime minister who would later take control of the entire country. Mussolini's heart is devoted to the country, but his ferocity and tyranny have both praise and criticism. It is difficult for us to make a judgment for a while, but his courage and perseverance are truly admirable. Compared to those in our country who are decadent and unmotivated and do not take responsibility for their actions, how far apart is his virtue?</p>

<p>I went to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 4th of this month for school matters. I returned to Shanghai by the Shanghai-Nanjing train yesterday morning. There are some things worth recording during my two days in Nanjing. The capital was originally the old capital of the Six Dynasties. In the early Ming Dynasty, it was also established as the capital.</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Big Rats of Jingdezhen · Die · Hua <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Jingdezhen, located in Jiangxi, is a famous region for porcelain production. Residents there have never paid attention to hygiene. The abundance of rats there is rare in the world. The rats not only jump and run around in broad daylight, but also walk on the streets without any fear. Recently, Jingdezhen has been plagued by rice shortages, and porcelain factories have successively stopped production. The rats have also suffered from food shortages and are becoming increasingly disturbed. A certain porcelain merchant, unable to bear the rat infestation, bought several cats in the hope of suppressing them. Unexpectedly, the cats not only failed to catch the rats, but were instead bitten by them. The owner of the shop, at his wit's end, devised a trap to catch rats in rice jars and caught a large rat more than a foot long, with black fur with a golden hue and teeth as sharp as blades. It weighed more than three pounds. It is said that the owner of the shop, seeing the rampant rats and the ineffectiveness of the cats, will offer a reward for rat-catching devices to eliminate this problem. This is after the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied it as its capital during the mid-Qing Dynasty. It was later destroyed by the Qing army. After the devastation of war, the beautiful prosperity turned to ashes. After nearly a hundred years, its vitality has not been restored. Since the National Government established its capital here, a new atmosphere has emerged. The former palace of weeds and millet now has towering summer houses. The former streets lined with people's houses now have vermilion gates facing each other or have been leveled into Zhongshan Avenue. On the streets of the past, only horse-drawn carriages and chartered cars bumped and galloped. Now, cars are racing in succession. From the perspective of material construction, it has gradually transformed from a dilapidated classical city into a modern city. Also, people in the capital now call Xiushan Park "Blood Flower Park" or "Zhongshan Park," and visiting the imperial tomb or Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum is now called "visiting Zhongshan Mausoleum." The singing girls along the Qinhuai River have been replaced by performing artists, and fortune-tellers have been replaced by document writers. Advertisements for imperialist goods on the walls have also been largely overthrown by revolutionary slogans. Other examples include the transformation of the military governor's office into the National Government, Southeast University into Central University, the police department into the public security bureau, and the magistrate into the county head. All these reflect the new face of revolution. During the two days, I visited the Gulin Temple and the ancient woods and bamboo forests around Qingliang Mountain, admired the new lotus and tender reeds of Mochou Lake, and paddled the small oars and clear waves of Xuanwu Lake, as well as visited the crops of the university's farm and caressed the ancient pines of the Mei Nunnery. Revisiting the old places evoked new feelings. I deeply felt that the green hills, clear waters, abundant grass, and long forests here were full of life, pleasing my ears and eyes and benefiting my mind and spirit.</p>
<h3 id="e102">At the Commemoration Meeting of the School for the Blind by Wang Yanjin <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>In the afternoon of the 8th, the School for the Blind on Yidingpan Road held its 16th-anniversary celebration. In addition to a public exhibition of the works of blind children, there were also recreational activities to add to the fun. I went to visit and gained a lot of knowledge, which I record in this essay. Keeping a piece of paper as a souvenir. As soon as I entered the door, many male and female attendants led me in for a visit and first gave me a small white paper as a souvenir. The paper was marked with raised dots in twenty-six types, which represent the twenty-six letters of the English alphabet. The letters were combined to form words. What was written on the paper was the twenty-six letters of the English alphabet and "We hope you have enjoy yourself this afternoon" in English. At the bottom of the English text were Chinese letters, which read, "Thank you for coming today. This paper is presented as a souvenir." The blind children could understand the meaning of the raised dots with a touch, just like we read books. The exhibition room contained four displays of various works by blind children, such as rattan-woven chairs and tables that were exceptionally smooth. The toys made by elementary school students, such as tangrams, paper folding, and stringed lanterns, were extremely clever. The visitors praised them in unison. At that time, three blind children were drawing rattan and weaving nets, dividing the work and cooperating exceptionally well. Their dexterity in scraping rattan skin with knives was enough to shame those with slow hands and feet. The blind also have a library. The school is very well-equipped and has a library with hundreds of volumes of books in Braille, mostly common-sense books for general use, followed by books on religion. Translations of the Three Principles of the People and other party doctrines are also available, which is truly rare. The blind conquer the sighted. In the visiting recreation room, there were</p>
<h3 id="e103">Travel Notes from Southeast Asia (27) Linghua <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>On the 12th, my feet suffered from dampness. The temple monk turned martial arts master gave me a prescription, and many friends gave me many medicines. I didn't know which to choose, which shows how difficult it is to choose a prescription. Therefore, in the Avatamsaka Sutra, Sudhana's fifty-three visits all say that he has made up his mind but does not know how to practice the Dharma. Regarding the problem of feet suffering from dampness in Southeast Asia, it is also a question for those who come here. The original words vary from person to person, and it is difficult for me to judge. Some told me not to take too many showers, once a day is enough, or said that I must take many showers, or said that the way to take a shower must be to shower from the top and down, and it is best to open your eyes so that people can hear the sound of the water flowing, and you should never take a bath like in China. While showering, you must vigorously rub the heat out of your body, and the most important thing is to wipe your feet dry after the heat flows down to your feet to avoid moisture, which is the cause of the disease. I have read all kinds of things and it is difficult for me to follow them one by one. Or some said that you must take a shower at dawn, so you will not be tired all day, and even if you don't take a shower during the day, it is okay. I used to take a shower at 11 o'clock when I felt hot, but now I take a shower every morning, and the disease really gets better. Maybe it's effective. In short, the climate in Southeast Asia is hot and unsuitable for guests. Those who grow up here don't have to worry, but those who come here must pay attention. The only important thing to resist the heat is to use the coldness of the water to reduce the heat on the body, which is more important than food and drink. Those who come here should pay attention to it. On the 13th, I had a minor illness. I had been paying attention for a long time to the question of the people of Southeast Asia and studying what kind of people the black fruits of black people belong to and where their blackness comes from. I couldn't get the point for a long time. Some said that this is a member of the Indian people called the Ji Neng people or the Ji Ning people, or said that their race is black and born like this, or some people said that it is black from sea bathing, or said that it is black because of applying a kind of oil, or said that their children are not black, or said that they are black because of sea bathing and oil. I thought that the sea is not sure to make people black, why are sea fish scales white and not black. One day, Zhang Xuanjun explained it and said, "Why are you doubting? Chickens have black chickens, red chickens, and white chickens. Horses have black horses, white horses, and yellow horses. Cattle, dogs, pigs, and sheep all have five colors and are born naturally. Why must there be a reason? Aren't people animals with five colors? Why must you test where they come from one by one?" I suddenly realized that I had been studying zoology for a long time, but it was Zhang Jun who revealed that the five races are just like the five-colored animals. Then how can you say that white is good-looking and the rest are not good-looking? How can you say that yellow is superior and black is inferior? Color is equal. It is true equality. Although this is said, even our yellow people are afraid of the blackness of black people. Their color is like molten iron and cannot be washed away. They are really like black chickens, and their bodies are hairy and their skin is not clean. Their curly hair is straight like black ghosts. I often look at them closely. The blackness is like human bones. If I meet them in our country in the middle of the night, no one will doubt that they are people. People will definitely doubt that they are ghosts. No doubt, children and women are really scary. Black people are honest and mostly stay outside the doors of Chinese people, wearing two pieces of cloth to cover their upper and lower bodies. They have nothing else. Those who work for the British are given a standing star by the government. This is the kindness of the ruler. Black people like to wrap their heads and wear floral skirts. The colors are bright in the Malay area, but the colors are lighter in Java. Some young black people also imitate European dress, and white clothes make them even blacker. (The number 27 marked under yesterday's title was a mistake for 26.) There are all kinds of musical instruments, such as organs, pianos, and violins. In addition to musical instruments, there are Go, Chinese chess, and military chess. When playing chess, a blind child and a sighted student were fighting hard. I watched carefully from the side. After a while, all the chariots and horses east of the Honggou were taken by the blind child, and then he killed his Chu commander and won a great victory. It is said that blind people have a calm mind and often win chess games. I think that if you can focus on one thing, you can definitely make progress. The value of blind people playing chess lies in their concentration. Blind people's special skills are amazing. After a while, I suddenly heard the military music and went to the large playground in front of the school building to watch the recreational activities. Men and women sat together and watched around like a wall. The programs included blind children singing party songs and playing military flutes, which were sad and passionate like the cold reed pipes outside the Great Wall. The acrobats stacked pyramids and human mountains quickly and skillfully. The instructor clapped his hands as a signal, but the audience who witnessed the stunt could not applaud for fear of disturbing the blind people's movements, which was also interesting.

She even said yesterday that she wanted to treat me to a big meal!" Ah Jin said this, and Ruiyun did not deny it, so it was decided. Zuo Shichen said, "Tomorrow around seven or eight o'clock, I'll write a note at Yizhixiang to invite you." Yizhixiang is very close to Qinghefang, and you pass by there seventeen or eight times every day after your performance, Ruiyun suddenly said. "Don't you invite me. I'll invite you tomorrow," Shichen said. "What's the reason for that?" Ruiyun said, "Then what's the reason for your inviting me?" Shichen said, "Haven't I invited you before? This time, inviting you is just like you're going on a long journey, and I'm here to see you off." Ruiyun said, "I didn't invite you specifically. I've told Ah Jin several times that we should also have a comfortable big meal. I've promised her several times, but the damn performances are always three, four, fourteen, fifty every day. Where do I have the time for that? Now that there are fewer performances, I'm inviting Ah Jin to invite you to be the guest of honor." Shichen quickly agreed, "Okay, okay, I'll be the guest of honor." On this day, the head madam was going back and forth between the front and back rooms, looking like she was very proud of herself. She also wanted to hear what you were talking about. She didn't know whether Ruiyun was happy or worried. As usual, those in the brothel who were getting someone from the madam's hands to marry couldn't get the person's consent. Even if a guest in the brothel wanted someone, they would only discuss it with their fake mother and never seek the person's consent. Therefore, those who made a living in the brothel had no personal freedom at all. Whoever she wants you to marry, you marry. You have no choice but to obey. There is no possibility of resistance. Even if there is someone you are happy to marry, but your fake mother, your owner, refuses to allow it, there is nothing you can do. Under this kind of situation, those poor things that are delicate and graceful cannot be considered a person. They can only be considered a kind of animal, and a kind of animal that is kept and imprisoned. Just like livestock, sometimes they use your strength, and sometimes they sell you out. Until now, this system of selling people is still prevalent, and I don't know how many good daughters have been killed. Someone like Ruiyun is still someone that the head madam usually loves, but this unwritten law that getting someone to marry in the brothel requires the person's consent cannot be broken. She just kept telling Ruiyun how good the Zhang family was, and also said that on that day, I would teach them to use a carriage to pick you up, just like people welcoming a bride. The windows of the carriage should also be covered with red silk. Although you are becoming a concubine, you don't need to have a wedding ceremony, but you have to look good when you go out. Now, which of your girlfriends doesn't envy you? It's just like the moth's own Zhang Lang's brush. The mother is diligent in doing makeup for the daughter. I don't know what will happen in the future, so listen to the next chapter.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Gold Market Resumes Its Ascent <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Market Fluctuations and Uncertainty Result in a Gain of 4.9 Taels; Transition from Weakness to Peak</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was quite chaotic, with sudden and unpredictable changes. Fluctuations of several taels were common and difficult to grasp. Throughout the day, the price difference reached as much as fifteen or sixteen taels, but the overall trend shifted from weakness to a peak. Foreign exchange rates had been rising, but internal conditions improved. Among brokers, transactions involving promissory notes were frequent, with varying demand and supply. However, the market sentiment was uncertain. Firms such as Zhifeng, Yongcheng, Fengyong, and Yong Shengchang, as well as speculators, were generally selling off. Fuchang, Wanxing, and Kunhe, among others, were buying. Early in the day, large transactions pushed the market slightly higher, but the overall trend was flat. Later, major players leaned towards selling, fueled by rumors that Ministers Kong and Song were considering measures to address the gold price surge and silver depreciation, including a proposal to the national government to temporarily suspend operations of the Gold Exchange. This sparked widespread fear, causing a sharp drop in market prices, with a fall of ten taels, resembling a rapid collapse, breaking through the 560-tael mark. With the subsequent improvement in exchange rates, buyers regained momentum, and the market stabilized. After a period of calm, the price surged upward, jumping over ten taels and breaking through the 70-tael barrier. In the later market, Fuchang, Wanxing, Shunli, and others aggressively bought, while Zhifeng, Yong Bingxing, and smaller investors sold. Exchange rates remained inactive due to Wednesday's holiday, and the gold price hovered around the 570-tael mark. The volatility of the market left participants disoriented.</p>
<p>After the opening, there was a sharp drop. Yesterday, the British pound had risen by sixteen points, and the silver price by a quarter. The opening price for July was 567.5 taels, an increase of eight qian. It then rose to 68 taels, with small investors buying in. Subsequently, a rush to sell by various firms led to a negative sentiment, causing a sharp drop of ten taels, ultimately falling to 57 taels and one qian. The initial assessment was that the market should be bullish. When more buying followed, the British pound rose by two or three points. When it opened at 57 taels and two qian, June British gold transactions between banks were at 7 pence 625. Then, British gold rose by half a penny, the U.S. dollar by one yuan, and Japanese gold fell by three and a half points. At that time, the gold price was still around 58 taels, which was mainly due to small transactions in the morning. Suddenly, there was a rush upward, as the foreign exchange market showed signs of tightening. August settlement was at 7 pence 625. Korean demand for July Japanese gold was 1 tael, 1 qian, 4 fen, 7.5. A grain merchant offered August at 7 pence 3225. As a result, the gold price surged, jumping up ten taels, reaching 67 taels by 10:30 AM, then falling back three or four taels, reaching 62 taels, three or four qian around 11:00 AM. Later, it rallied, with eager buyers, causing another surge of ten taels, albeit with fluctuations of one or two taels at times. By noon, it was at 72 taels, closing at 71 taels and eight qian.</p>
<p>The highest price in the later market reached 73 taels. The later market opened at 70 taels and 0.8 qian, then rose from 1 tael and 4 qian to 69 taels and 6 qian. Seeing strong buying, the price rose by more than three taels, reaching 73 taels. Subsequently, there was a sudden drop of four or five taels. Zhifeng Yong and others were selling. Around 2:30 PM, the price was at 67 taels and eight qian. Afterwards, the market gradually rallied, with Fuchang, Shunli, and Wanxing aggressively buying, leading to a steady rise. By 3:45 PM, it had broken through the 70-tael mark again. As the foreign exchange market was inactive, the price rose by five taels after 4:00 PM, reaching 572 taels and seven qian. There was a slight dip momentarily, and the market closed at 4:30 PM at 71 taels and six qian, an increase of 4 taels and nine qian compared to the 10th.</p>
<p>Small transactions amounted to forty or fifty taels. The largest price difference in one day was 73 taels, and the smallest was 57 taels and one qian, a difference of 15 taels and nine qian. The announced price was changed to 611 taels and four qian, a reduction of fifty taels, down to forty taels. In the afternoon, there was a reduction of forty taels. Registered account replenishment was at 72 taels. Physical goods opened at 67 taels and five qian in the morning, closing at 70 taels at noon, and closing in the afternoon at 70 taels and five qian.</p>
<p>The market was bustling with activity. Firms involved in transactions included Fuchang, Bingxing, Yuankangxiang, Wanxing, who were buying; Zhifeng Yong, Yu Da, Chengfeng Yong, Yong Chengchang, Xiangyu, Yuancheng, Yuanxing Yongfu Yu, who were selling. Taixing and Hengxing had fluctuating positions. In the afternoon, Fuchang, Wanxing, Shunli, Hengxing, and Yufa Yong were generally buying, while Dadecheng, Yuancheng, Yuanyu Yong, and Fuyu were generally selling. Firms were frequently buying and selling. The Dalian firms had a total of over 4,000 transactions in the morning, with balanced buying and selling after consolidation. In the later market, there were over 1,000 buying transactions and three or four hundred selling transactions. The Guangdong firms had a total of over 1,000 transactions.</p>

The gold price continued to fluctuate, with a difference of sixteen taels, largely influenced by sentiment. Chinese merchants and speculators were somewhat active, but market sentiment was unclear.

<h3 id="e109">While Silver Interest Rates Rise, the Market Remains Stable <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>General Market Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the silver interest rate market was robust, the lack of collateral among those in need was less severe than in previous days, with adequate funds available for withdrawals. However, as silver remained tight, interest rates were unlikely to increase, leading to a weak market and an overall decline in interest rates.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices (Foreign Interest Rates)</p>
<p>Due to the rising silver prices, interest rates were suppressed. The sale of silver by banks and foreign firms further weakened the market. The morning rate was 7 qian 1 fen 6 li, and the noon rate was 7 qian 1 fen 5 li half, a decrease of 1 li 1 hao 2 hu half compared to the previous noon rate.</p>
<p>(Silver Interest Rates)</p>
<p>Silver tightening led to rising silver interest rates. The morning rate was 2 qian 5 fen, and the noon rate was 2 qian 3 fen, an increase of three to four fen compared to the previous noon rate. Bank posted rate was 1 qian, plus five to six fen of "water".</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Market</p>
<p>The morning rate for Jiangnan small silver dollars was 6 qian 3 fen, and the noon rate was 6 qian 2 fen 9 li. The morning transaction volume was 2,000 jiao, and the noon volume was 1,000 jiao. The morning rate for Guangdong small silver dollars was 5 qian 9 fen 4 li half, and the price remained the same at noon due to limited transactions. The morning transaction volume was 135,000 jiao, and the noon volume was 35,000 jiao. Copper coins rose by 2,000 to 410,000.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver Funds)</p>
<p>Yesterday, banks saw limited silver inflow and outflow. Chinese merchants had inflows of 1.4 to 1.5 million, foreign firms had inflows of 1.2 to 1.3 million, and various goods and exchange inflows totaled over 7 million. Inflows to warehouses were 500,000, and outflows were 600,000. Japanese banks had total inflows of over 4.5 million and outflows of 300,000. Silver houses and public firms had inflows of over 39 million and over 3.5 million in "water" funds. Inflows from various remittances totaled over 800,000.</p>
<p>Inflow and Outflow (Foreign Funds)</p>
<p>Exchange transactions were 1.17 million in the morning and 1.181 million at noon. There were no banknote transactions in either session. Off-market banknote transactions were 165,000 in the morning and 145,000 at noon. Interbank transactions were 550,000 in the morning and 600,000 at noon. Foreign firms and banks had transactions totaling 2.3 to 2.4 million, with banknote inflows and outflows exceeding 1 million. Silver houses and public firms had transactions totaling over 4.2 million, with over 2.4 million in "water" funds. Over 1 million in foreign loans were borrowed.</p>

<p>Limited to only 300,000. Small silver houses had transactions of 500,000 to 600,000.</p>

<p>Reorganization Bonds Decline Sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday's public bond market saw a wide variety of instruments traded in the spot market, but transaction volume remained low. Trading in forward contracts was slightly lighter than the previous day, with only Reorganization and Customs bonds remaining relatively active. Bond prices were firm in the morning but fell later as buyers turned hesitant. Reorganization and Demobilization bonds saw the largest price swings, with the July Demobilization bonds falling by 1.8 yuan compared to the previous day.

<p>The yarn market has somewhat stabilized, but the overall sentiment remains soft. The sharp decline in the previous day led to profit-taking, causing the market to rebound slightly. However, actual sales remain sluggish. The Osaka Sanpin yarn market has seen a significant decline, dampening market sentiment. Major buyers remain hesitant to release their holdings. The yarn market is temporarily stabilizing. Overall, weak current demand will prevent any significant price increases. The price of human-made yarn within the 160 tael range is likely to fluctuate. Human-made yarn prices are gradually increasing. The opening price for forward contracts in the morning was steady, with limited sellers and more small investors covering their short positions, leading to a strengthening market. Prices for all months rose by three, four, or five qian. Prices continued to rise throughout the afternoon. However, Sanpin yarn remains soft, and actual sales remain slow. The market is still strong, with prices for all months rising by another three, four, or six qian. Total transaction volume for the day was 13,750 bales. The closing prices for human-made yarn are listed below:</p>
<p>Human-Made Yarn Closing Prices, Change, Open Account Balances</p>
<p>September: 159.8, up 2, 20.900</p>

<p>November: 160.3, 910.000</p>
<p>August: 158.2, 728.050</p>
<p>Current Sales Slow Down</p>
<p>Current yarn sales are slow. Various firms purchased 570 bales, and inter-firm sales were 300 bales. Market conditions are stable.

In addition, Shantou purchased 45 bales, Tianjin purchased 80 bales, Xiamen purchased 20 bales, Hankou purchased 50 bales, Sichuan purchased 110 bales, Niuzhuang purchased 10 bales, and other firms purchased 30 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Cotton Market Rebounds <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The gold market is stable, and bulls are not selling. Han firms are covering their shorts, selling into rallies. The cotton market is calm, and the sentiment is still strong. However, the overseas cotton market is weak, and Han firms are considering covering their shorts, selling into any rally. Actual sales in the market are slightly active. Buyers are hesitant to release their holdings due to high gold prices and relatively expensive foreign cotton. Bulls and bears are evenly matched. Unless there are significant exchange rate fluctuations, there is unlikely to be a sharp decline. However, Han firms are selling aggressively, putting significant downward pressure on prices.</p>
<p>Han labels: Shenchang sold over 4,000 dan. The opening price in the morning was firm due to the stable gold market and small investors covering their shorts. Prices for all months rebounded by five fen to one qian. The market sentiment remained firm in the afternoon, and prices rose again by one qian to two qian half. However, Shenchang sold 4,200 dan of No. 33 cotton, and No. 10 cotton also sold 2,000 dan. Total transaction volume for the day was 29,600 dan. The closing prices for Han cotton are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e115">Grain: River Down Rice Market Trends Higher <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Shabei</p>
<p>Yesterday, over ten ships arrived from various routes, with good sales. Northern japonica rice had sales to other provinces, so medium and lower-grade rice rose by half a jiao. Market sentiment was positive. General prices were around 20 yuan. The afternoon situation indicated continued upward momentum. Thin rice sales along the main street were also active. Sources were drying up, and the market was tightening. Cash transactions had become the norm, with quick sales. Prices were stable. Top-grade rice required 18 yuan and change. Yin yuan rice was scarce and stable.</p>
<p>Shanghai South River Down</p>
<p>Limited arrivals. Sales were slightly better. Changxi Northern japonica rice had brisk buying, and prices rose by one jiao, opening high at 20 yuan 6 or 7 jiao. Su Tong machine rice was sluggish due to the cloudy weather. There were no significant fluctuations in the overall market. Sellers were only slightly more bullish.</p>
<p>Southern Firms: Sijing, Liantang, etc.</p>
<p>Thin early rice arrivals were not strong, and inventory was also drying up. The market had upward potential, but overall sales were slow for the day, so prices remained stable. Yang xian and Duzi xian inventories were normal. Yin Yuan Hua Diao Huai continued to arrive. Street sales were sluggish, and prices were stable.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Origins of the Downturn in Forward Flour <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Bulls rushed to sell, and factories secretly unloaded.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market experienced a period of sluggishness in the morning, down by about one fen compared to the previous day's closing. Subsequently, short covering revitalized the market, with near-term contracts rebounding by two fen and forward contracts rebounding by about one fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, the current month remained tight, reaching a high of 2 taels, 5 qian, 7 fen half. However, starting from July, as major bull positions rushed to sell, or had already entirely reversed course, factories also softened their stance and secretly unloaded forward contracts. As a result, buying momentum weakened, and the market showed signs of loosening.</p>
<p>Observation: As spot prices opened at 2 taels, 6 qian, 5 fen, the current month ultimately remained firm. With forward contracts considered to be far off, and factories continuing to unload, prices were likely to fluctuate. The current month rose by 2 li half compared to the previous day, while July fell by 7 li half, August fell by 1 fen, and September fell by 5 li. October and November fell by 7 li half.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Near-Term Wheat Surges Seven Fen <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>New wheat is being acquired by various factories, totaling 10,000 bags.</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the wheat futures market opened, prices for all months were generally flat and sluggish. However, subsequent trading saw an increase in momentum. Although the current month involved new wheat, recent deliveries to Shanghai were truly limited. The Jiangbei region would not begin full shipments until after the Grain in Ear festival. Furthermore, current inland prices were more expensive than the standard price. As a result, factories and industry insiders generally agreed to accumulate inventory, leading to aggressive price increases. Forward contracts also rebounded due to strong factory buying intentions. The market is expected to remain stable if inland prices do not decline.</p>
<p>The current month surged by seven fen compared to the previous day, August rose by three fen, September rose by four fen, and July, October, and November each rose by two fen. Factories are eager to acquire new wheat at high prices, with asking prices increasing by six to seven fen. Nanjing wheat: 4 taels 8 qian 7 fen. Kunshan wheat: 4 taels 9 qian 4 fen. Wusong wheat: 4 taels 8 qian 2 fen. Pudong wheat: 4 taels 7 qian 3 fen. Penglai Town wheat: 4 taels 9 qian 2 fen. Jiading wheat: 4 taels 8 qian 7 fen. A total of 10,000 bags were opened. Old wheat prices also increased by four fen due to depleted inventories. Xu Zhou and Bengbu wheat were quoted at 5 taels 2 qian half, totaling 2,000 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday, more foreign rice arrived, and sales were slightly slow. Although there were purchases from Changjiang Main Street and Dalian firms, the total sales volume was only slightly over 10,000 bags. With large arrivals and slow sales, prices fell slightly. Opening prices included: No. 1 Saigon: 2,000 bags, price 16 yuan to 15 yuan 9 jiao. No. 2: 2,500 bags, price 15 yuan 2 jiao half to 0.5 fen. Small jiaozhi: 2,500 bags, price 15 yuan 2 jiao 7 fen to 1 jiao. Mindang: 1,000 bags, price 15 yuan 1 jiao half. Extra Gao: 15 yuan half. Also, Subendi and various brown rice types: over 2,000 bags, prices were slightly soft.</p>

<p>Xiushui and Wuning black tea markets had gradually improved this year, with dozens of firms setting up shops to procure tea. First-grade boxed teas were already packaged and awaiting shipment. However, on the 16th of last month, bandit Peng Dehuai invaded and captured the Xiushui county seat. Most of the tea shops in Baishang, west of the city, were burned down, and the tea stored in the shops was burned and looted, resulting in significant losses. The tea market was completely halted. Military forces were encircling and attacking, pushing them towards the Hunan border. However, the local losses were severe, and it is uncertain whether the tea shops can rebuild and resume operations.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Tunxi Tea Market Plummets <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The high-grade Zhenmei tea from Tunxi tea firms that rushed to Shanghai failed to obtain favorable prices. Concerns are unusually high. No one inquired about the new tea arriving from various routes, and even tea from Wuyuan's high-quality farms was priced low. As of recently, Tunxi tea firms still had over 4,000 dan of unsold tea. High-quality tea was priced at 40 yuan, while lower-quality tea was only 20 yuan. The tea market is plummeting.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Transportation Issues for Wuyuan Boxed Tea <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The first-grade Zhenmei teas from Wuyuan's various villages have been gradually boxed. Aside from the west route (Fuchun, Huchuan, Dayoushan), the north route (Fengshan, Hongguan Ridge Foot), the south route (Zhongyun, Kengtou Kongcun), and the east route (Daban, Jiangwan, Xitou) being exported via Jingde and Tunxi, the middle, lower, north, and city area boxed teas have relied on the Lehe waterway for transportation. However, the Lehe River has been blocked due to the rampant banditry. As a result, most of the boxed Zhenmei teas have been stockpiled in the shops and cannot be transported.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Zhangcun Jixianglong and other firms, seeking to avoid losses, hired porters to transport teas through the drought road to Shangxikou, and then via Tunxi and Hangzhou to Shanghai. Each porter carried six dan of boxed tea. Firms are now planning to transport tea through this route. However, as the farming season is in full swing, it is difficult to find so many porters. Thus, transporting boxed tea to Shanghai has become a major issue for the tea market. Firms are hesitant. The new tea markets in various villages have been affected by these issues, and prices have declined again. Yesterday, tea from Yanshan, Tuochuan, and Liyuan was priced from 54 yuan to 58 yuan, while tea from Zhuangtian and Shatan was priced at 51 yuan, 15 yuan lower than in mid-June. The remaining routes saw little trading, and the market was unusually quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Foreign Firm Silk Market Remains Stagnant <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The local foreign firm silk market is nearly collapsing. European sales remain stagnant. Although the silk exchange rate continued to rise yesterday, overseas silk prices were reported to be falling again. Shanghai's new silk telegrams did not indicate a rebound. Chinese silk merchants are losing too much due to the silk capital relationship, so it is difficult to sell at a lower price. The silk market is helpless, and manufacturers are unable to mediate.</p>

<p>Fine cloth and plain silk fabrics sold extremely well.</p>
<p>The cloth market recovered its calm, but prices rose too quickly, causing actual sales to hesitate. In addition, the money market was unusually tight, and those selling off goods also announced a halt. Yesterday, merchants in the eastern market subtly signaled movement, and a rebound is possible. White crepe and Yuan Yang yarn remained firm and expensive due to shortages. Yuan Zhi Gong Ni and Zhi Gong Duan gradually stabilized. There was an increasing amount of fine broadcloth in stock. Huxinting was priced at 2 qian 4 fen 7 li 5 hao, Lie Yan Mu Qiu at 2 qian 4 fen 2 li 5 hao, and Gucheng Hui at 2 qian 8 fen 5 hao, a drop of 2 li 5 hao from before. Hua Biao frequently appeared at new lows, having already fallen below the 3 liang 9 qian mark. The lesser quality patterns were only about 6 qian. The extreme cheapness of the price has never been seen before, so Shanghai goods have also slightly declined. Among Western goods, plain silk fabrics were the most popular. More than ten boxes a day were sold in the Xiaodongmen area, leading to a sharp rise in prices. De Ji Jin Gongzi was priced at 6 qian 7 fen 5 hao, Feng Yu Da Fugui at 6 qian 2 fen 5 hao, Kang Fu goods at 6 qian, and Li Xin goods at 5 qian 2 fen 5 hao, an increase of 1 qian to 5 fen.</p>

<p>Ministry of Communications' Determination</p>

<p>To Recover Telephone Concessions</p>
<p>The Process of Consulting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: The issue of the Ministry of Communications taking back and self-managing telephone services in the Shanghai Concession has not yet materialized. Here are the letters from the Ministry of Communications to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated September 4th, November 8th, and December 11th of last year, as well as the consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 30th of this year, to show the Ministry of Communications' determination.</p>
<p>(1) September 4th, Public Letter from the Ministry of Communications to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs:</p>
<p>It has been heard that the Shanghai Public Concession Board of Works believes that the telephone services provided by the China and Foreign Telephone Company are performing poorly, and there is talk of canceling its contract rights and soliciting bids from other merchants. In the Tianjin and Hankou concessions, telephone services were initially run by foreigners, but were later taken back and managed by the Ministry of Communications. After repeated improvements, their performance is far superior to that of the Shanghai Concession's telephone services. Now that the Shanghai Public Concession Board of Works believes that the China and Foreign Telephone Company is performing poorly and intends to change the contractor for telephone services, this Ministry, responsible for improving and developing the national telecommunications industry, should seize this opportunity to nationalize the Shanghai Concession's telephone services in order to restore national sovereignty and facilitate public communication. Accordingly, this Ministry requests your Ministry to negotiate with the Shanghai Public Concession Board of Works to transfer the contract rights for telephone services in the concession to this Ministry, so that it can fundamentally improve them according to the spirit and experience of this Ministry in managing telephone services in the Tianjin and Hankou concessions. As for the original assets of the China and Foreign Telephone Company, their current value can be estimated and reimbursed by this Ministry. Your consideration and handling of this matter is requested, and the progress of the negotiations should be reported from time to time. Sincerely, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>(2) November 8th, Public Letter from the Ministry of Communications to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs:</p>
<p>Your Ministry's letter was approved, stating that in response to the letter stating that the Shanghai Public Concession's telephone services are performing poorly, it is heard that the Board of Works intends to solicit bids from other merchants. This Ministry intends to seize this opportunity to nationalize the telephone services and requests your Ministry to investigate and negotiate with the Board of Works to transfer the contract rights for telephone services in the concession to this Ministry. After the Ministry ordered the Jiangsu Negotiator to investigate and negotiate, the Negotiator reported back, stating that the case has been handled in accordance with the instructions, and that the poor performance of the concession's telephone services has caused complaints from both Chinese and foreigners. The Ministry of Communications has the responsibility to improve and develop the national telecommunications industry, and it is right to take over the management at its own expense for the convenience of public communication, etc. A letter was sent to the Shanghai Consular Corps requesting them to forward it for handling. The reply stated that after verification, the Chairman of the Board of Works replied that the current telephone services are indeed performing poorly, and that someone familiar with the matter will arrive in Shanghai on October 18th to investigate the current situation and prepare for consultation with the Board of Works, so it is hoped that all improvements will be made thereafter, etc. It is appropriate to reply for review, etc. In this regard, the poor management of the Shanghai Concession's telephone services is recognized by both Chinese and foreigners. However, the biggest reason is that the concession's telephone services are operated independently by foreign merchants with the aim of making profits. Therefore, telephone equipment is not replaced with new equipment until it is broken and unusable. Otherwise, the original old equipment will have no place to be disposed of, which is contrary to economic principles. The fact that most of the Shanghai Concession's telephone services, except for a few that have been converted to automatic, are still old magneto-type equipment is clear evidence of this. Therefore, the Chairman of the Board of Works' hope for improvement may be difficult to achieve. Furthermore, this Ministry is in charge of the national telephone system, which is very broad. If the Shanghai Concession's telephone services are taken back and managed, the situation can be assessed and improved at any time. The old equipment can also be moved and installed elsewhere for utilization, so that both construction and economy can be taken care of at the same time. Moreover, for the sake of restoring national sovereignty and facilitating public communication, it is imperative to take back the Shanghai Concession's telephone services. In accordance with the previous letter, this Ministry requests your Ministry to investigate the previous letter again and instruct the Jiangsu Negotiator to argue with the Shanghai Consular Corps to take back the Shanghai telephone services. Sincerely, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>(3) December 11th, Public Letter from the Ministry of Communications to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs:</p>
<p>Regarding the case of taking back the Shanghai Concession's telephone services, your Ministry previously stated that the Board of Works claimed that personnel familiar with the concession's telephone services would arrive in Shanghai to investigate and improve them, etc. A reply was sent to the Ministry, and the Ministry immediately sent a letter to your Ministry requesting you to instruct the Jiangsu Negotiator to argue with the Shanghai Consular Corps. Recently, it was reported that the Shanghai Concession's telephone services had been inspected by experts specially hired by the Board of Works and that foreign merchants would jointly purchase them. If this happens, not only will this Ministry's plan to reorganize and develop the Shanghai Concession's telephone services be shattered, but the contract rights for the telephone services will be lost to foreigners for a long time. Whether for national rights or for public use, it is necessary to take them back immediately. This Ministry, in charge of the national telephone industry, believes that if this opportunity is lost, it will be difficult to find a remedy. Accordingly, this Ministry requests your Ministry to investigate and handle the case as usual, and still hopes to receive a reply. Sincerely. May 30th, Consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Regarding the matter of consultation, this Ministry previously heard that the Shanghai Concession authorities had the intention of changing contractors due to the poor performance of the Concession authorities' telephone services. This Ministry believed that telephone services belong to the communication industry and are a type of national right. This Ministry, in charge of the national telecommunications administration, should seize this opportunity to seek to take them back in order to restore national rights and benefit the people. On September 4th of last year, this Ministry sent a letter to your Ministry requesting that negotiations be initiated to prepare for the repurchase. Subsequently, your Ministry replied on October 22nd without any results. On November 8th, this Ministry sent a letter to your Ministry requesting that the Jiangsu Negotiator be instructed again to argue with the Shanghai Consular Corps. In recent months, it has been repeatedly reported that the Concession authorities have been continuing to solicit bids, and the general method is that the winning bidder will use the funds to repurchase the original shares of the China and Foreign Telephone Company, take over the contract, and convert all the telephone services to automatic within the shortest possible time. The Concession authorities will grant them exclusive rights for 40 years and allow them to increase telephone rentals so that the annual net profit equals a certain percentage of the invested capital. The three bidding companies are all purely foreign merchants, and recently there has been news that the International Telegraph and Telephone Company is about to win the bid. The other two companies have objections to the China and Foreign Telephone Company's Advisory Committee's recommendation to accept the International Company's bid. Telephones are a public communication service, which is quite different from the business of ordinary buying and selling goods. In order to protect the rights of Chinese merchants, encourage investment, plan for a smooth takeover of the Concession, and reduce the burden on the Chinese people in the Concession, and for the convenience of communication between residents in the Concession and those outside the Concession, this Ministry cannot remain silent. Accordingly, a brief statement of reasons is attached and sent to your Ministry, requesting that you make a serious protest to the Consular Corps of various countries in Shanghai, urging them to make a decision as soon as possible to hand over the Shanghai Concession's telephone services to this Ministry for management, and declare to them that the Chinese government will not recognize any method of selling the China and Foreign Telephone Company to foreign merchants. At the same time, please appoint a special commissioner to work with the committee appointed by this Ministry to properly discuss and prepare the takeover methods to facilitate the process. Your consideration and handling of this matter is requested, and a reply is hoped for. This consultation is sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>Yang Shuzhuang Talks About the Fujian Incident</p>
<p>The War Will Not Be Prolonged - Return to Fujian via Beijing is Not Confirmed. The Mainland News Agency reported that Lu Xingbang's troops in Fujian Province attacked the provincial capital, leading to a fierce battle with Liu Heding's forces. Yang Shuzhuang, the chairman of the province, was on vacation in Moganshan. After hearing the news, he immediately returned to Shanghai. There were rumors that he would go to Beijing and then return to Fujian. Yesterday, a reporter from the Mainland News Agency visited Yang's residence on Avenue Dubail and presented his card to inquire about the truth of the Fujian Incident and the current measures being taken. Because Yang was not fully recovered, his adjutant, Lin Zhijin, received the reporter on his behalf. The following is a record of the questions and answers between the reporter and Lin Zhijin:</p>
<p>(Reporter) When did Chairman Yang arrive in Shanghai?</p>
<p>(Lin) He arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 9th) by express train from Hangzhou at 1:30 PM.</p>
<p>(Reporter) Has his health recovered?</p>
<p>(Lin) Not yet. Because of the tiring journey, all visiting guests are received by me on his behalf.</p>
<p>(Reporter) What is the truth of this Fujian Incident?</p>
<p>(Lin) I will not go into details. Everything is similar to what has been reported.</p>
<p>(Reporter) Can the battle between Liu and Lu be resolved in a short period of time?</p>
<p>(Lin) According to Chairman Yang's prediction, it will not be prolonged and may end within a few days. The central government has paid close attention to the matter since it started, and Yang also attaches great importance to it. Yesterday, he received telegrams from Acting Provincial Chairman Chen Peikun and Commander Chen Jiliang, both saying that the war will not be prolonged.</p>
<p>(Reporter) Can we know about Chairman Yang's current measures?</p>
<p>(Lin) After arriving in Shanghai, he has dispatched the Yongjian and Tongji warships and four seaplanes to Fujian to assist. He has also telegraphed Acting Chairman Chen and Commander Chen to take appropriate measures.</p>
<p>(Reporter) Is it true that Chairman Yang will return to Fujian in the next few days?</p>
<p>(Lin) He has not yet recovered and has no intention of returning to Fujian for the time being. He may have to go if necessary.</p>
<p>(Reporter) Is the rumor about going to Beijing true?</p>
<p>(Lin) There is no intention of going to Beijing either.</p>
<p>(Reporter) So Chairman Yang will stay in Shanghai for convalescence?</p>
<p>(Lin) That is the plan for now, but his whereabouts will ultimately depend on the situation in Fujian.</p>
<p>At this point, another guest arrived, and the reporter excused himself.</p>

<p>Naval Aircraft Transported to Fujian</p>
<p>Yesterday, they were transported by the Tongji warship and exported to Fujian Province. Lu Xingbang clashed with Liu Heding, and Lu used communists to disturb the provincial capital. Now, Liu's Chen Brigade has taken the Puan warship from Guangdong to Fujian to join the navy in attacking Lu's army. Yesterday, it was heard that Lu's army had been defeated by Liu Heding. The Naval Department, in order to assist in suppressing the rebel enemy, ordered the local naval aircraft station to send aircraft. Commander Shen Dexie奉令ordered pilots Peng Xi and Chen Chuancheng to take a Jiangluan seaplane and transport it to Fujian by the Tongji training ship. The ship set sail yesterday (11th) at noon. The Yongjian gunboat, which was transferred from the capital to Fujian, passed through Song yesterday morning. It is estimated that both ships will arrive in Mawei tomorrow.

<p>Prohibition of Foreign Silver Imports</p>
<p>Crackdown on Smuggling of Foreign Silver - Unification of Trading Rights. Since the National Government issued an order prohibiting the import of raw silver, Shanghai's silver reserves decreased temporarily. However, recently they have increased greatly again. The reason is that many people are smuggling in silver, and some are trying to transport it through other places. As a result, the amount of foreign silver in Shanghai is increasing day by day, and the silver market is becoming more and more difficult to control. Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance has instructed the Jianghai Customs to strengthen inspections to prevent smuggling. In addition, because several foreign banks in the local area have been engaged in the trading of raw silver, Minister Song has decided to unify the import and export of raw silver under the management of the Central Bank alone in order to centralize authority and avoid abuses. This order will be announced within a few days.</p>

Director Zheng Lai of the Public Debt Department was specifically ordered to come to Shanghai to assist in handling the matter. It is now learned that Director Zheng, after Minister Song returned to Beijing, negotiated with the board of directors of the Securities Exchange for several days to determine the plan to maintain the bond market.

<p>Social Affairs Bureau Promotes Sanitary Rice</p>
<p>The 12th Standing Committee Meeting of the Municipal Food Committee resolved to promote sanitary rice in order to reform bad habits. After approval by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Xinchang Rice Milling Factory took the responsibility of producing and selling a trial run. The Hongsheng Rice Shop in Hongmiao Lane, the Hengxingsheng Rice Shop at Laolaji Bridge, and the Hesheng Rice Shop at Sanmaoguan Bridge on Nanjing Road were selected as sales locations. The Social Affairs Bureau was requested to file a record and announce the promotion. The Bureau believed that high rice prices, insufficient production, and restricting waste were urgent tasks. In addition to approving the filing, a notice was issued for posting to facilitate promotion. The notice is copied below:</p>
<p>(Notice Regarding Sanitary Rice: According to the Xinchang Rice Milling Factory, in order to promote public health and reduce food consumption, it is requesting that it be announced that top-quality sanitary rice is being sold, along with an advertisement stating that rice is an essential nutrient for the human body, and that nutrients such as protein and fat are contained in the rice bran. People in Shanghai only seek refined white rice for the sake of their appetite, without regard to nutrition, resulting in diseases such as beriberi, heart disease, and indigestion. Sanitary rice is properly matched, not sticky, rich in nutrients, easy to digest, and beneficial to health. It is also priced low, reducing one yuan per stone, etc. According to this investigation, the top-quality white rice sold in the market lacks nutritious raw materials and wastes food. After investigation and verification by this Bureau, it is true that bad habits should be reformed to emphasize hygiene. Therefore, this notice is issued.)</p>

<p>Encouraging the Development of Public Works</p>
<p>The Central Area Construction Committee, in order to encourage citizens to develop public works in the area, has drafted ten articles of measures, which have been submitted to the Municipal Government and passed by the Municipal Council. The text of the articles is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Shanghai Special Municipality's Measures for Encouraging the Development of Public Works in the Central Area:</p>
<p>(1) Any private individual or organization that develops public works in the central area, such as libraries, museums, and other public facilities that do not conflict with the nature of the central area and are not for profit, may request the Municipal Government to borrow public land for the construction of houses for the project.</p>
<p>(2) When requesting to borrow public land, the project plan and construction period should be submitted to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>
<p>(3) The area of public land borrowed for each public work shall not exceed fifty mu.</p>
<p>(4) The location, term of loan, rent, or amount of rent for the public land shall be determined by the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>(5) The public land shall not be sublet or changed in use. If such circumstances occur, the Municipal Government may take back the land and confiscate the buildings and all equipment on the land.</p>
<p>(6) The public works shall comply with all laws and regulations of the city and shall be subject to the supervision of the competent authorities of the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>(7) If the construction of the public works is not started within one year after the approval of the plan, or if it cannot be completed within the prescribed time limit, the Municipal Government may take back the land and recover the corresponding rent, unless there are special circumstances that have been permitted.</p>
<p>(8) When the public works are discontinued, it must be approved by the Municipal Government, and the borrowed public land shall be returned. All buildings and equipment on the land shall be taken back by the Municipal Government at a price to be determined, or demolished within a time limit.</p>
<p>(9) When the term of the loan expires, an application may be submitted to the Municipal Government for extension. If the Municipal Government deems it necessary, it may take back the public land or increase or decrease the rent. When the loan is taken back upon expiration, it shall be handled in accordance with Article 8.</p>
<p>(10) The provisions of these measures shall also apply to government agencies borrowing public land for the development of public works.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Arsenal Ammunition Loading Room to Be Rebuilt <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>An Interview with Director Zhang: After the explosion at the ammunition loading room of the Gaochang Temple Arsenal in this city on the 3rd, it is heard that the building there will be rebuilt. Yesterday, a reporter from the Kwok Man News Agency met with Director Zhang of the arsenal inside Gaochang Temple, who was surveying the foundation at the old site. The following is a record of Director Zhang's remarks:</p>
<p>Bidding for the Building Has Been Finalized: Zhang stated that there was a renovation plan for the building before it was destroyed, but it was postponed due to financial difficulties. Now, with the urgent need for military supplies, work cannot be stopped for even a day. Therefore, the building will be actively reconstructed. The bidding process was completed on Monday, with the bid price reportedly being 6,000 yuan. The plan is to still build three single-story buildings, but the area will be twice as large as before. The location is problematic because it is further west and closer to Longhua Road and the naval aircraft factory. If the old site is used, the obstacles of the armory make it difficult to design. Therefore, the site is still under survey, but a decision will be made soon. Once construction begins, the building can be completed in a little over a month.</p>
<p>Priming Powder Will Be Combined in One Place: The priming powder room was originally at the west end of the factory. However, because the priming powder and ammunition loading were close to each other, it was easy to cause danger, so they were separated. Now that the building is being rebuilt, it is planned to move the priming powder room back to one place, separated by an earthen wall to avoid danger.</p>
<p>Equipment Must Be Greatly Improved: In the future, the building will still be made of wood, not cement, because the stronger the ammunition loading factory, the greater the explosive force, which is the same principle as making bombs. Therefore, in the future, the roof and windows on all sides will be made of wood, but the inside will be divided into compartments with earthen walls. Each room will have a maximum of two or three workers. If an accident occurs, there will be no major sacrifices. The tools used during work must also be greatly improved to prevent danger.</p>

<p>Great Loss from Fire Burning Indian Cotton: The Japanese ship "Yangnan Maru" transported a large batch of cotton from India to Shanghai this time. A fire broke out when the ship reached the South Pacific Islands. Most of the cotton in the ship was burned, and the loss is estimated to be over 100,000 yuan. Yesterday, the ship arrived in Shanghai, and a large batch of burned Indian cotton was also loaded onto the shore. The following is a report on the damage and follow-up measures:</p>
<p>Situation of the Fire: The Japanese ship "Yangnan Maru" was chartered by the Osaka Company, a Japanese merchant in this city, and sent to Bombay to transport a large amount of cotton to Shanghai. This time, a total of 8,150 bales of machine cotton and 6,000 to 7,000 other miscellaneous goods were loaded in India. The cotton in the ship was divided into six holds. On May 15th, when the ship was approaching Singapore, a fire suddenly broke out in the fourth hold. Cotton is easily flammable, and once it catches fire, it spreads very quickly. Later, the fire spread to four holds, and the fire was extremely fierce. The crew used all the water to put out the fire, and the fire was extinguished by filling the four holds with seawater, thus preserving more than 2,000 bales of cotton in the front holds.</p>
<p>Transport to Shanghai for Unloading and Inspection: After the fire was extinguished, the ship arrived in Singapore, stopped briefly for some repairs, and then quickly sailed to Shanghai for unloading. Yesterday, the ship entered the port and unloaded at the Linghua Warehouse in Zhangjiabang. Out of the total of 8,150 bales of cotton, 65% were burned or heavily water-damaged, with a total loss of 5,322 bales of cotton.</p>
<p>Handling Average Adjustment: When unloading the fire-damaged cotton and water-damaged goods, the Osaka Company notified the various firms in this city to send representatives to the site to supervise. At the same time, the public adjuster Haiming's Acheson was invited to the dock for inspection. It was estimated that out of 2,215 pieces of Shanghai goods, 624 pieces were burned. The remaining 4,000 pieces that were burned were purchased by Japanese merchants and reportedly resold to Chinese merchants. Currently, the company is handling the average adjustment as usual, requiring the firms to pay a portion of the average adjustment fee, which will be returned after the compensation issue is resolved.</p>
<p>Ship Repair: The ship "Yangnan Maru" was damaged by the fire, and the hull and nets were burned. It cannot sail on the high seas without major repairs. Yesterday, after unloading the cargo at the Linghua Wharf, the ship was scheduled to leave Shanghai today and return to Japan for dry docking. It is reported that the fire damage to the cargo alone amounted to over 100,000 yuan, not including the damage to the ship's hull. The firms and insurance companies have agreed to sell the water-damaged and burned cotton at the original dock in this city.</p>

<p>Tunan Collides with Japanese Ship: The Tunan of the China Merchants Bureau returned from Hankou to Shanghai. It first berthed at the Yangjiadu Wharf, and after the passengers disembarked, it sailed to Puxi. When the ship was in the middle of the Huangpu River, it had to turn around as usual. At that time, the river was very turbulent, and the Japanese ship "Shimizu Maru" happened to be there. The Tunan was impacted by the turbulent current and collided with the front of the Japanese ship. Fortunately, the captain tried his best to reverse, resulting in only a light collision. The deck canopy and other items on the Japanese ship "Shimizu Maru" were damaged. After the Japanese ship claimed compensation, the China Merchants Bureau immediately sent engineers with materials to repair the Japanese ship "Shimizu Maru" yesterday. Fortunately, the Tunan was not damaged.</p>
<p>Piece Goods Can Be Transported to Ningbo: Last month, Ningbo increased taxes on imported piece goods. The piece goods merchants in Shanghai had agreed to unanimously refuse transportation. After this incident occurred, it was closely related to the market. After mediation by various parties, it was determined that the tax increase was a regulation set by the Ministry and could not be easily withdrawn. As a result, the piece goods merchants in Shanghai canceled the refusal to transport the goods, and they are now being transported to Ningbo as usual.</p>

<p>Costing a Total of 2.4 Million Yuan: Merchant ships sailing between Shanghai and Yichang have long been dominated by British and Japanese companies. This is because there are many reefs in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and the river ships sailing in the lower reaches cannot sail between Hankou and Yichang. Zhao Tieqiao, the supervisor of the China Merchants Bureau, saw that the shipping rights were being taken over by foreign countries, so he requested approval from the Ministry of Communications to build four Sichuan ships, using gasoline engines, which are faster and more stable than coal-fired engines. The four Sichuan ships have already been built by a certain shipyard in this city, with an estimated total value of 2.4 million yuan (Continental News Agency). Gold Industry.</p>

<p>Tragedy in the New Puyutang Women's Hospital:</p>
<p>The Madwoman First Hits Her Head with a Porridge Bowl:</p>
<p>Then She Actually Took Out a Kitchen Knife and Chopped Two People to Death: Jiang Xu, a madwoman sent by the Second District Office to the New Puyutang in Nanshi on the 10th of last month, was kept in the women's asylum. Her madness had healed three days after entering the hospital, but the wound on the front of her head had not healed. At the request of her family, she was transferred to the women's hospital for medical treatment for more than 20 days, and there was nothing unusual. She even went to the door to buy things from time to time. Unexpectedly, her old illness recurred at 10:00 PM on the evening of the 10th. She first hit her head with a porridge bowl. When the female nurse saw this, she tried to stop her but was ineffective, so she went out and called a male servant to help. Then the woman actually took out a kitchen knife from the hospital's canteen. The patients in the same hospital were all terrified and fled. However, Gao Cailan (from Shandong) and Zhou Jinzhu (from Guangdong) were unable to escape in time and were dragged out and chopped randomly with the knife. When the female nurse summoned the male servants to come, the two had already been chopped to death. When the madwoman saw the crowd coming, she hid in the toilet pit in the patio, covered in feces. She was dragged out and her wrists were handcuffed to prevent another tragedy. On the other hand, the court was asked to inspect the scene. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Yang arrived at the scene to inspect the scene and ordered the bodies to be collected. It is reported that the City Social Affairs Bureau received the news yesterday morning and Feng Section Chief and Rao Staff Member, together with Gong Staff Member of the Public Security Bureau, rushed to investigate and properly plan for the aftermath. All madmen in the asylum and other madmen's institutions will be strictly ordered to be isolated and seriously cared for, whether they are cured or not, to avoid unexpected events. Yesterday afternoon, at Xiaomuqiao Road</p>

<p>Robbed of a handgun and over 300 yuan　　Was it for money or revenge?</p>
<p>Yesterday (12th) at 11:20 AM, a shooting occurred suddenly in the Sanjia Li area near Longhua Road Xiaomu Bridge in southern Shanghai. The deceased was shot five times and died on the spot. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e153">Zhang Ziyan's Background <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Ziyan, 46 years old, was a local of this area. He resided in Zhangjiazhai, west of Xiaomu Bridge on Longhua Road, southern Shanghai. He worked as an accountant at the Rihui Port Warehouse Wharf, Beipiao Coal Mine Company, and Xingji Accounting Firm. He was currently the executive member and standing committee member of the 5th District Organizing Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Wharf Workers' Union and also served as a volunteer guard in the 2nd Defense Section of the 11th Team of the Xiaomu Bridge Guards.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Family Depends on His Livelihood <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Zhang had a large family. His elderly mother, Liu, was still alive at 67 years old. His wife, Zhou, was the same age as Zhang. They had a son and three daughters. The son, Erchun, was 20 years old and studying in the third year of high school at Junyi Middle School on Guohuo Road, Puyudong Road in the southern city. The eldest daughter, Lianying, was 23 years old and still unmarried. The second daughter, Jingying, was 12 years old, and the third daughter, Yuying, was only 7 years old. The whole family lived in Zhangjiazhai in the countryside. Besides two self-built bungalows, they only had about two to three mu of inherited farmland. The whole family depended on Zhang for a living.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Suddenly, Thugs Jump Out <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Because of his position as a union committee member, Zhang feared being envied, so he specially prepared a No. 11451 self-defense handgun, which he carried with him. Yesterday at around 11:10 AM, after finishing lunch at home, Zhang first went to the Guards for a short rest and then planned to go to Xingji Company for work. Unexpectedly, when he passed the Sanjia Li area, about one li south of Xiaomu Bridge, the place was extremely desolate, and the road was very narrow, only allowing one person to pass. Suddenly, two thugs jumped out from the side of the river.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Five Bullets Hit His Body <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Zhang was walking slowly along the river when two thugs suddenly jumped out from behind, drawing guns and firing at Zhang. Five bullets hit Zhang's body, all in vital areas. He immediately fell to the ground, blood gushing out. By the time nearby villagers heard the sound and rushed over, the murderers had already escaped. They immediately rushed to report to the nearby Xinxiqu Second District Police Station. Officer Wang, upon receiving the report, immediately led the chief constable to the scene to investigate. At the same time, someone familiar with Zhang rushed to inform Zhang's family.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Died from Severe Injuries <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Zhang's family rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. At that time, Zhang was still alive, so people carried him to his home, but he died from his injuries upon arrival. Officer Wang immediately telegraphed the headquarters and ordered the head of the local security, Sun Yongzhang, to report to the local court for an autopsy. The deceased's younger brother, Peiqing, accompanied Sun to the court to report. The deceased's brother, Zhang Peiqing, requested an exemption from the autopsy, but the prosecutor did not approve the request due to the seriousness of the shooting. He will send someone to perform the autopsy today. According to the family, the deceased also had over 300 yuan in cash and a self-defense handgun with him, which were all taken away by the thugs. The knife hole on his pants and</p>

<p>Zhao Yunqing's cleverness backfires. Falsely reported robbery to embezzle money. The ruse was ultimately ineffective. The original banknotes were found on top of the bed.</p>
<p>Zhao Yunqing, 21 years old, from Hankou, was a shop assistant in Yongji Duck Feather Shop on Guohuo Road, outside Xiaoximen in the southern city. Yesterday morning around 9 AM, Zhao was ordered by the shop manager, Liao Zhifang, to take 200 yuan in cash to Yuancheng Money Exchange on Dou Street for deposit. Unexpectedly, after Zhao took a China Merchants No. 1 tram to the New Wharf and went into Lixiang, he suddenly encountered two robbers who stopped Zhao and robbed him of all 200 yuan in cash. Knowing he was being robbed, Zhao quickly grabbed one of the robber's hands and shouted for help. The robber then took out a sharp knife from his pocket and stabbed Zhao in the right leg. Zhao, in extreme pain, immediately let go, and the two robbers fled with the stolen goods. Afterwards, Zhao reported the above situation to the first district headquarters. After preliminary interrogation by the district chief, the case was handed over to squad leader Dong Mingde and detectives Yuan Haishan and Ren Shouzhi for detailed investigation. Then, Dong and others observed that the knife hole on Zhao's pants did not match the shape of the knife wound on his leg. The distance was also greater, which was suspicious. After repeated questioning, Zhao initially hesitated to answer. Finally, he confessed that when the manager instructed him to take the money to the money exchange today, he went upstairs and hid the money on top of his bed and then went out, took a tram to the New Wharf, picked up a piece of broken bowl from the roadside, and slashed his thigh, then used a knife to cut a hole in his pants, and then falsely reported to the district that he had encountered a robbery. He said that he had resorted to this trick because he was in financial difficulty. After the confession, the original banknotes were immediately taken from Zhao's bed and brought back. After the district chief's review, the matter will be handled further.</p>

<p>Implemented according to the construction committee's rules for inspecting electricity theft. The Special Municipality's rules prohibiting users from stealing electricity have been abolished.</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau issued a notice yesterday stating: Regarding the matter of the notice, the city's electric companies previously drafted rules prohibiting users from stealing electricity, which were submitted to the bureau for review and forwarded to the municipal government for approval and implementation. Now, according to the municipal government's order, the Construction Committee inquired and found that the electric power industry in our country has gradually developed in recent years, and the matter of users stealing electricity has also increased. There has been no uniform standard for the inspection of electricity theft and the recovery of losses. Most of the measures are independently determined by electric power operators, resulting in discrepancies in strictness and leniency, which greatly hinders the progress of the entire electric power industry. Therefore, twelve rules for the inspection of electricity theft and the recovery of electricity fees by electric power operators have been established to serve as guidelines. They have been reviewed and ordered to be promulgated and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. In addition to issuing notices to various provincial construction departments, ten copies of the rules are attached for your government to forward to the public and private electric companies registered with the committee for compliance. Accordingly, eight copies of the original rules are attached and ordered to be forwarded to the electric companies for compliance. In addition to ordering the Chinese electric company, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, Pudong Electric Company, and Baoming Electric Company, which have been registered by the Construction Committee, to comply, the previously established rules prohibiting users from stealing electricity are abolished from today. This notice is hereby promulgated for general knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Attempt at Reconciliation in the Huashen Temple Lawsuit <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Lu Shiquan, the manager of the Huashen Temple in Ximen Xieqiao, was sued by the Fresh Flower Industry Association, which was organized by the flower industry, for not allowing Lu to reside in the temple. Therefore, Lu filed a lawsuit in the local court against Wang Heyuan, a standing committee member of the association, for obstructing his rights and demanding compensation for damages. Yesterday morning, the judge opened the trial. Lu Shiquan stated that the position of manager of the Huashen Temple had been inherited for three generations. Since the establishment of the temple, it was originally a thatched hut built by the flower industry people for the purpose of worshiping the flower god, and there were no funds. The plaintiff's three generations managed and expanded it into eight flower sheds, making it the grand sight it is today. Since the defendant and others forcibly seized it, they have demolished five of the flower sheds, leaving only three. Only after the industry organized the Flower Industry Association, the plaintiff was commissioned as a receiving and dispatching person, with a monthly salary of ten yuan. Up to this year, he has not received a single cent for thirteen months. Now they are expelling the plaintiff, so he demands the recovery of losses: the three flower sheds in the temple are worth 600 yuan, and the remaining flower pots are worth 200 yuan, plus 130 yuan in salary, totaling 930 yuan. Defendant Wang Heyuan stated that because the plaintiff (1) harbored bandits while managing the temple, (2) often lost objects, and (3) was unclean and unhygienic, he was suspended. The official asked if the court could attempt reconciliation for you, provided that the plaintiff does not harbor outsiders in the future, is careful not to lose objects, and cleans the house every day to make it clean, then your expectations can be satisfied. The defendant said that although I am a standing committee member, I cannot make the decision. I should convene a meeting of the executive committee to have the right to make an agreement. The official then instructed that the executive committee should be convened within a week to report the decision to the court for review, otherwise a judgment will be made according to law. The court then adjourned.</p>

<p>Wang Lushi is extremely shameless. Wang Dianhuai is close to being a rogue.</p>
<p>Wang Lushi, a woman from Yangzhou, 43 years old, who lives in a flat in Wangjia Lane, north of Caojiadu, Shanghai, has a son and a daughter. The son, Guilin, is 23 years old, and the daughter, Aer, is also 20 years old. Although the woman is old, she is extremely flirtatious. She had a relationship with Pu A'gen, a blacksmith, last spring. The affair was discovered by her daughter, Aer, who became jealous. Then, the woman used a trick and married her daughter Aer to Pu as his wife to prevent her daughter from spreading the news. For Pu, it was killing two birds with one stone. In the spring, Pu married the daughter. So, the lover became the son-in-law. However, they still had an affair and secretly went to the woman's house to continue their old relationship. The neighbors all paid attention and were shocked. The other night, Pu went to sleep with the woman again. While they were having fun, Wang Dianhuai, a man from Shandong, broke into the house with two or three accomplices and caught the couple in the act. They tied them up with ropes. Pu saw that he had been exposed and repeatedly begged Wang for mercy. Wang demanded 50 yuan from him. Then, Luo Yingbao, an accomplice, mediated and persuaded the woman to pay 15 yuan. The woman agreed. The next morning (yesterday), Wang went to collect the money. The woman took the opportunity to run to the Guangfu Road Police Station and reported the incident. The police dispatched officers to arrest Wang and the other defendants, totaling five people, and sent them to the Sixth District Police Station.

<p>The wife once accused the husband and mother-in-law of abuse. The husband then filed for divorce.</p>
<p>Lu Yingquan, a local resident who lives in Miaotou, Zhabei, married a woman surnamed Jin from a nearby residence in 1919 through a matchmaker. At the beginning of their marriage, the relationship between the couple was still harmonious. In recent years, the relationship has become cold. Since then, there have been quarrels and even assaults. Because Lu Jinshi was repeatedly abused by her husband and mother-in-law, she felt resentful and filed a complaint with the local court this spring. After being summoned, the case was dismissed in court. Now, Lu Yingquan has also filed a personal lawsuit in the local court seeking a divorce. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Keqian opened the trial. First, Lu Yingquan stated that the defendant Lu Jinshi had repeatedly quarreled with my mother and even associated with hooligans, even colluding with hooligans to come to my house to cause trouble. My mother was afraid and hid in the bedroom. Those people smashed the door open and beat my mother, even smearing feces on my mother's head and face, causing her eyes to be injured. When I returned home and tried to dissuade her, the defendant was unreasonable and tore my clothes to shreds. At this point, he presented the torn woolen shirt and asked for inspection. The defendant Lu Jinshi stated that she was 27 years old, a resident of Miaotou, currently living in her mother's home. She married the plaintiff at the age of 16. At the age of 18, she gave birth to a child who died prematurely. She has no children now. On November 28th of last year, her husband and mother-in-law beat and expelled her. She had no choice but to return to her mother's home temporarily. Her husband had an affair this year and beat her on the 16th and 17th of January. I really had nowhere to complain. I was instructed to dismiss the case and returned to my mother's home. On March 21st, I returned to my husband's home, but my husband and his lover ate white rice while I ate wheat flour and was still beaten, told to marry someone else. On April 16th, the rice was cooked, but they didn't give me any. My husband's mistress runs a teahouse and hotel called Sanmei, surnamed Qu, and she is now living with my husband. On February 28th, the mistress gave birth to a daughter, so on the night of May 1st, the mistress entered the house. The official asked the plaintiff if he had an affair. He replied no. The official said that according to your statement, he beat the mother-in-law and still filed a complaint? He replied yes, because he went out to work and made sisters and worshiped the old man. The official asked if women also have old men? He replied that the old man is a disguise for the mother. The official asked how many households are in the same house. He replied five or six, such as Lu Baorong, Lu Xingsheng, Lu Houshi, etc. The official asked the defendant if she had beaten or insulted the mother-in-law. She replied to please ask the court to investigate the clan chief Lu Zhangquan and Lu Xingsheng, etc. I have not made any mistakes. He wants a divorce, I don't want it. Now, whether divorced or not, the plaintiff will pay 30 yuan per month until I am 60 years old. The official then attempted reconciliation for both parties, ordering the plaintiff to compensate the defendant 500 yuan for living expenses. The plaintiff replied that he had no money and could not comply. The official then instructed the two parties to reconcile outside the court for one week. If reconciliation is not possible, the court will schedule another hearing to summon witnesses and continue the trial. The court then adjourned.</p>

<p>Testifying Frankly in Court Regarding the Assault on Her Cousin – Wang Yueqin, a private prostitute residing at No. 882 Hongxing Lane, Beijing Road, coerced 14-year-old Wang Yueying into receiving clients. Yueying, unable to bear the abuse, pleaded in vain, resulting in a severe beating by Yueqin, leaving her body covered in injuries. Neighbors, motivated by humanitarian concerns, spoke out against the injustice. The Lao Zha division of the police arrested Yueqin. It was reported yesterday that Yueying, originally surnamed Wu, was lured from Hangzhou to Shanghai along with her younger sister Yuegu under the pretext of finding work in a cloth factory. Yuegu, only ten years old, was spared complete corruption, while Yueying suffered not only from beatings with a stick on her legs and buttocks but also severe injuries to her private parts. Yesterday morning, the police escorted the two girls and Yueqin to the Special District Local Court, charging her with violating Article 249 of the criminal law. Presiding Judge Zhou Hanting conducted the trial, with Chief Prosecutor Zhou also present to perform his duties. Yueying first recounted her ordeal of being forced to receive clients and the beatings she endured. Wang Yueqin confessed that her cousin Yueying could not endure the hardship of working in the factory and willingly followed her into prostitution. She had recently received a Cantonese man who initially desired her but, upon arriving at her house, agreed to pay ten yuan for a night with Yueying. Because Yueying was young, she still acted on her behalf, sharing the earnings equally. Later, she beat Yueying for stealing money, not for refusing clients. The woman spoke frankly about her prostitution, seemingly unaware of any shame. After the trial, Judge Zhou sentenced Wang Yueqin to one year and two months of imprisonment. Yueying and Yuegu were temporarily placed in the Jiliang Institute, awaiting their family to claim them.</p>

<p>At about 7:00 PM yesterday, a fire broke out at the Ruiji Hat Factory distribution office at No. 73 Taiping Lane, 16th Embankment, Nanshi, when a burning alcohol stove overturned on a bed while heating food. The smoke and fire quickly ignited the bed curtains. The fire department was notified and immediately dispatched a fire engine to the scene. The fire was extinguished shortly after. Fortunately, the fire was detected early and did not cause a major disaster. Only the bed curtains, bedding, plank walls, and miscellaneous items were burned, with very little loss. Thank You: We would like to thank the Commercial Press for donating one copy each of the English Weekly No. 753 and Children's World Volume 25, Nos. 14 and 15. Thank you.</p>

<p>Yesterday, at 4:30 PM, the Zikawei Observatory issued a weather forecast stating that the sky would be overcast with intermittent rain.

<p>To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao: I am writing to address the report of a strike at the Meiya Silk Factory in the local news column of your newspaper on June 11, which does not correspond to the facts. The factory workers did indeed stage a strike, which the Shanghai Municipal Training Council and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau jointly denounced, ordering them to resume work immediately. The workers who were dismissed—Lu Xiancheng, Wei Jiequan, and Zhang Fangyi—were illegal strike leaders who defied party and government orders and undermined the factory's operations. They were not four in number. The case has been submitted to the Shanghai Labor Arbitration Committee for arbitration. The Meiya Silk Factory has not changed its compliance with the terms of the Labor Agreement of 1927, as confirmed by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. The workers' request to revoke the temporary employment contracts is also unfeasible because the factory is required by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to have workers sign employment contracts. All disputes are being mediated by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. No workers attended the first arbitration and mediation meetings, so the matter was not resolved. The workers staged a second strike during the arbitration and mediation period, which is illegal. I urge you to correct the inaccurate report immediately to prevent the spread of misinformation. I request that this letter be published in the local news column of your newspaper. Sincerely, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, June 11.</p>

<h3 id="e192">D.H. Lawrence Dies <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>D.H. Lawrence, the British novelist known for his shocking portrayals of sexual psychology, has died. He passed away in March of this year in Provence, Italy, but news of his death has only recently reached us. Last month, Reuters news agency solemnly reported the serious illness of William J. Locke, a second- or third-rate British novelist in France, to the world. However, Reuters made no mention of the death of Lawrence, whose status and value far surpassed Locke. This may seem like a small matter, but it illustrates the lack of importance placed on Lawrence by his contemporaries and the cold treatment he received from his own countrymen. Lawrence has now become a figure in literary history, and his status and value will be determined by literary historians of this generation. We cannot know for sure at this time. However, because Lawrence was also a key figure in the modern literary world, one of the few important modern writers in Britain, we feel compelled to discuss this writer briefly now that we know of his death.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Nineteen Years Ago <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Lawrence, the son of a poor miner and a graduate of a teachers college, published his debut novel, The White Peacock, after leaving the dreary life of a teacher to pursue literary creation. It immediately garnered praise from the artistic community and attention from readers. A rumor accompanied the book, claiming that the author suffered from tuberculosis and did not have much time to live. As a result, Lawrence's most notable traits at the time were his tuberculosis and his short life. These two qualities undoubtedly aroused sympathy for the author among countless readers. However, the weak young genius, who was said to be nearing death, actually fought tirelessly against death, only succumbing after eighteen or nineteen years of struggle. This was something that those who deeply pitied him at the time never expected. Nevertheless, Lawrence was never a healthy man. His illness not only caused him physical suffering but also affected his spirit. This influence is evident in his works. The unique sensitivity, anguish, hope, and passion of tuberculosis sufferers can be seen in his works. His extraordinary mental and psychological sensations and emotions inevitably make us think of tuberculosis patients. Many writers have been associated with tuberculosis throughout history. In Britain, Keats and Stevenson are two well-known examples. However, Lawrence was different from them. Keats, Stevenson, and others tried to separate their illnesses from their writings, meaning they tried not to let their illnesses show in their works. Lawrence, on the other hand, was not like that. His illness and his writings were intertwined, making them impossible to analyze. The characters he wrote about, the psychology he portrayed, and the world he described were all written with the heart of a tuberculosis sufferer and through the eyes of a tuberculosis sufferer. In the years leading up to his death, Lawrence lived primarily in warm Southern Europe and South America (Italy, France, Mexico, etc.) due to his health. The influence of sunlight can easily be found in his later works.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Pagan Blood <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Seemingly in response to the sunshine of the south, and responding with intense passion, he seemed to see sunlight as a symbol of the path life should take. In his view, sunlight was a symbol of light, strength, freedom, and enjoyment. This was because, in recent years, he had increasingly felt that modern Western life was too gray and (against sunlight), and a life without sunlight meant decay and death. Therefore, in his collection of poems published last year, Pansies (unfortunately, this was his last work), he said something like this: (Conscience is the feeling of acknowledging the existence of sunlight and the instinct not to go against sunlight). This wild and eccentric Lawrence undoubtedly became a proponent of "returning to nature" in his later years. He lamented the disappearance of primitive life, the rampant materialism, and the harsh restraints of morality and etiquette. The increasingly gray and mechanized nature of human life and the gradual decline and suppression of human desire made him feel endlessly depressed. Therefore, he could not help but long for that free, bright, happy, instinctive, and primitive life. Lawrence's mood seemed abrupt at first glance, but we would not be surprised if we knew his history and circumstances. Lawrence spent his early life in England. He was born in the industrial area of the Midlands in southern England. The world around him was filled with gloomy coal mines, greedy people, and gray skies. His father was a poor miner. He dropped out of school after a few years and also became a miner. However, this intelligent and eager-to-learn young man was unwilling to live this kind of life. Later, through the introduction of Mr. Simon, a local teacher, he went to a teachers college as a scholarship student. After graduating, he taught in London for three years. However, this was also not the career he desired.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Ms. Guan Zilan's Solo Exhibition <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Painter Guan Zilan will hold a solo exhibition at the Hua An Building from the 13th to the 16th. The image above is of her work (Portrait of a Lady). He began to pursue creative work. In 1914, just before the outbreak of the European war, his debut novel, The White Peacock, was published. Although it was only his first novel, his central ideas and philosophy were already evident in that work. If we were to summarize his philosophy in one sentence, it would be that we do not pay enough attention to our</p>
<h3 id="e196">On the Matter of the Flesh <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>That is, the aspect of bestiality. We subordinate the desires of the flesh to the qualities of the spirit, honoring the spirit and debasing the flesh, yet we do not know that the spirit is unworthy of occupying the highest position. Since he had this kind of philosophical thought, his works naturally contained many descriptions of sexual psychology and sexual desire. Such things were, of course, novel and bold in the British society, which was thick with gentlemanly air and moralistic sentiment. Although it aroused a lot of contempt and condemnation, this unknown young writer made a splash after all. His second work, titled (The Trespasser), was published in quick succession. The style and thought were completely the same as the first, but this book was rarely talked about. However, from the perfection of its style and the excellence of its form, it can be regarded as the best of Lawrence's works in terms of technique. His third full-length novel, (Sons and Lovers), is considered by many critics to be his best work. Some passages are written very beautifully and powerfully. The publication of this work increased his reputation greatly. (The Rainbow) is his fourth novel and also his first work to be banned. Even now, this novel cannot be openly sold in England. (The Rainbow) was banned by the authorities as soon as it was published. This was Lawrence's first conflict with the law, but at this time Lawrence was not yet a rebel with a clear awareness of opposing modern civilization. It seemed that the banning of his own works was beyond his expectation and greatly surprised him. Therefore, he remained silent for some time and dared not publish anything until four years later, when he published his fifth novel, (The Lost Girl). At this time, he was much more cautious in narration, but much more intense in propagating his views, especially in boldly advocating the concept of carnal desire. He believed that love should be based on carnal desire. If we all understood this point, we could be saved. From this novel on, he entered his second period. The novels he published in his second period were all bold and fierce, such as (Women in Love), (Aaron's Rod), (The Woman Who Rode Away), and (Lady Chatterley's Lover), which was privately published in Paris.</p>
<p>The later Lawrence's works became, the more they tended to promote his ideas, and therefore the more they neglected art. Therefore, his most artistically perfect novel is still (Sons and Lovers), which he wrote in his early years. His poems are also like this. The poetry collection (Birds, Beasts and Flowers), written in the early period, is so beautiful and keen, while (Thoughts), published at the end, is so crude and dry. Therefore, from the point of view of thought, the latter is valuable, but from the point of view of art, the former prevails. (Thoughts) is less like a volume of poetry than a book of random thoughts.</p>
<p>If we look at (Thoughts) purely from the perspective of poetry, it has no value. But if we put aside the outer form of poetry and pay attention to the thoughts within, then this thing is not only valuable but also extremely meaningful. As for the thoughts contained therein, they are of course completely (Lawrence's). Roughly speaking, it can be said that the world is already old, chaotic, and stinking. There is only fragmented licentiousness, no grand scale. There is passion, but only futile empty talk. There is no positive action. In short, this world has no order, no spirit, and no passion.</p>
<h3 id="e197">The World Is No Longer Masculine <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>All the dissatisfaction, instability, and culture and art in the world are the result of feminization. Women have destroyed us with unimpeded gentleness. We pretend to need us, but in fact, we are exhausted.</p>
<p>Because he felt that everything was feminized, he rejected all beauty. His meaning seems to be that before we can completely become free and masculine, we must remove all beautiful, gentle, and artificial things. For example, syllables, rhymes, diction, etc. are also in the category to be abolished. Therefore, we see Lawrence trying his best to write poetry (un-elegantly), seemingly deliberately writing his poems (masculine). As a result, the poems in (Thoughts) are of course very different from the poems we are accustomed to seeing. But this is not Lawrence's failure. This is really a concretization and centralization of Lawrence's thought.</p>
<p>Now Lawrence is dead. If we want to appreciate his art and thought, in addition to his several famous novels, (Thoughts), which has become his posthumous work, cannot be ignored. (Tiran)</p>

<p>London News: The old literary giant Shaw recently received a letter from a woman saying that she had newly organized a women's group and asked Shaw to give away a free copy of his (An Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism) so that she could read it. Shaw wrote at the end of the letter, "(Tut, a women's group that cannot afford fifteen shillings to buy my book has no right to exist)." and returned the letter. Not long after, he received another letter from the woman saying that she had shown the previous letter to a bookseller, who accepted it and paid her with a copy of Shaw's book. Shaw replied, "(Foolish woman, if you had taken the letter to the appropriate place, you could have been paid fifty pounds)." and sent it back as well. Shaw also told people that he hoped the woman could exchange the second letter for fifty pounds.</p>

<p>The large and small hanging, oscillating, and shaking head fans made by the Huasheng Electrical Manufacturing Factory on Zhoujiazui Road are of excellent material and solid workmanship, surpassing imported goods. The sales volume has been very large over the years. This year, due to the relationship between the high price of gold and the low price of silver, the prices of imported fans are too high. Even foreigners in Shanghai are happy to buy Huasheng fans. Chinese people who purchase fans should naturally target Huasheng products. Therefore, this year, the sales of Huasheng fans are even better than in previous years, and there is a great trend of supply falling short of demand. However, in order to promote domestic goods, the price is still extremely low. CAC underwear is greatly reduced in price. Zhenya Factory declares that various underwear with the CAC trademark and the Ya character trademark produced by this factory are tough, durable, refreshing, and sweat-absorbent, and have long been praised by the society. Now, from the 1st of this month, there will be a major price reduction for four weeks. The cheap price is unprecedented and is really an excellent opportunity for those who love and promote domestic goods. All department stores in this city and other cities sell it. The preferential wholesale regulations are unparalleled. The place of issue is No. 194, Beixiangfen Lane, Beishi Road. A temporary price list for the major price reduction is available and will be sent upon request. Tian'e Bookstore near the National Medical College on Xiahfei Road declares that this store was created to meet the needs of students in several schools in the area. Currently, it does not publish books but only sells publications and various stationery from bookstores in this city. Universal Printing Company, No. 460, Aierjin Road, declares that the advertising beauty group fan issued by this company this summer has reached a sales volume of 300,000 in just one month, which is a rare achievement in the printing industry and a good phenomenon of the booming business community in recent years. Now, in order to promote the fan, the company has specially added 100,000 more to make up 400,000. The price is still a cheap two and a half points per fan. After this amount is reached, no more will be added. Regardless of whether it is a business or factory, if you want to entrust printing, just notify us and we will come to negotiate. The phone number is 41730. Yanhua Lou Restaurant, opposite Dangui No. 1 Stage on Fourth Road, declares that the Cao Bai salted fish in this restaurant are selected by special commissioners from Guangdong every year. The goods are fresh, delicious, and palatable, and have always enjoyed a good reputation. Therefore, the annual sales reach several thousand fish. Now, at the time when new goods are on the market, the goods arrive every day and pile up like mountains. The goods are fresher and more delicious than last year, and the prices are also very reasonable. In addition, more than a thousand jars of spiced fermented bean curd have been transported, and the selling price remains the same: six corners for a large jar and two corners and five points for a small jar. Qingyise Restaurant on Sanma Road also sells it.</p>

Wuchang Grand Theater declares that this theater will screen the tragic film (Princess Drifting) and the adventure film (African Hunting Monster) from today. One is tragic and glamorous, lingering and poignant, and the other is hot, tense, and shocking. The film is a total of twelve major episodes, and the price will not be increased after one film is shown. A pack of new Zhizun cigarettes will be given away with the ticket.</p>

<p>School Drama's</p>
<h3 id="e204">Selection of Scripts <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The meaning and effectiveness of the school drama movement, simply put, is to make life dramatized. In our Chinese school life, everyone feels that it is too dull, dry, monotonous, and meaningless. The dead and heavy air pressure only sees the nation's one day of weakness and decline, or catches up with the road of depravity. Therefore, we have to borrow the power of literature and art as a material to awaken their will, excite and invigorate, recognize the bright road of life, strive to pursue the achievement of career, and destroy all the century's morbidities.</p>
<p>Since the new art form of drama has established its position in China, the school drama movement has had a special progress. In the past, it was a naive expression of emotional impulses in the style of civilized drama. Now it is a metaphysical improvement, a new artistic exploration of life. Especially in the past two years of development, we looked at the history of the school drama movement and it is worth our surprise. The drama clubs of various schools have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Not only universities but also middle schools are organizing one after another. Female students have also liberated the dignity of the boudoir and sacrificed themselves to run to the palace of art together. Those who are capable hold public performances independently, and those who are weak participate in the recreational activities. We should pay considerable respect to their spirit and perseverance.</p>
<p>This is the investigation of facts, and the theoretical exploration and publicity are also quite effortful and cannot be erased. Therefore, we can know more that the school drama movement has deepened a stage and gained considerable praise in education. Originally, the power of drama is to give people strength, to give people education, to give people entertainment, and to give people the method of life. Youth is just a youth When the flower is blooming beautifully, we must make it perfect, stand at the forefront of the times, actively struggle forward, and use their enthusiasm and boiling blood in the right place. This is what drama wants to influence them. The steps of drama can be divided into three paragraphs: one is selecting scripts, two is rehearsing, and three is bringing it to the stage. Since our biggest object is to give young people the power of life, then the first step we need to pay attention to should be the script. The scripts we want to apply must absolutely avoid low-level tastes, old-fashioned patterns, and erroneous concepts of class meaning, and be suitable for how to give our nation a new life. In other words, what we require is how to make (the national consciousness) sound. With a good script, we can express a good play and give people a deep impression | sympathy and emotion, as if these things were my own experiences.</p>
<p>Now, although many drama groups in various schools understand it, there are also many who have not grasped the new art form of drama, and even fallen into the wrong path. We can know this by observing the scripts announced by the public performances of various drama groups. Of course, there is still a lack of good scripts in China, but there are also not a few good scripts translated from foreign countries. The biggest problem is that the value of drama is lost for the sake of propaganda of a certain kind of thought. I think it is very wrong. Therefore, I express a little opinion on the selection of scripts for school dramas.</p>
<p>(1) Drama occupies a great power in the national movement. It encourages the national spirit of independence. Now is the era when we are seeking national independence. In the past, our national spirit was too depressed. Now we must re-promote and invigorate it. In thoughts, emotions, interests, customs, human feelings, and environment, we must pay attention to not letting young people forget their future mission.</p>
<p>(2) It is to promote education and make them experience life and recognize the world. Use rich content to make them understand the various different appearances of life and the typicality of human nature. It is also to explain and guide, so that they forget the so-called difficulty and ease, do not make meaningless roars, do not make meaningless lamentations, and bravely stride forward on the bright road of walking upward.</p>
<p>This is the script required by school dramas. I hope that the students who are working hard in the school drama movement will jointly discuss and guide the selection of scripts for various school drama groups. This is a project that cannot be neglected. If our school drama develops universally (Li Chunsen)</p>
