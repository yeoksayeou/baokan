<p>時評</p>
<h3>各國之選舉潮</h3>
<p>以前各國當選舉之期雖競爭劇烈然至大之不幸不過時聞違反選舉法被人控告而已今則不然每當選舉之時各極端派之相爭宛如交戰故常有傷人死人之舉動前次德國之大選舉所演之慘劇不一而足今茲印度孟買議會之選舉又因阻撓選舉而致拘捕女子五十人男子十一自後又因警察警告無效致為警棍所傷者百人被拘者三百五十人是每一選舉必犧牲多少人之生命與身體選舉固無異乎爭戰矣</p>
<p>原夫選舉之意舍去武力之爭鬥而用和平爭之謂也今不幸選舉之時亦用武力是已失去選舉本意矣由是以推選舉之一方法亦有盛極而衰之兆何也和平之選舉尚不足以壓奮興之人心也世界之潮流無一不提倡人心之奮興此世事之爭所以愈形劇烈而不平之氣積於人間者愈甚也雖有提倡和平之聲寗有效哉</p>

<h3>富記紙號經理　　　劉彤雲被綁</h3>
<p>方入汽車返家</p>
<p>綁匪一躍而上</p>
<p>車夫被逐跌傷</p>
<p>事前有函索詐</p>
<p>昨晚八時十分愛多亞路大自鳴鐘捕房對過公共租界打狗橋春耕里口忽然發生綁票案被綁者為該里四十五號富記洋紙號之經理劉彤雲當時匪共開槍六七響示威幸未傷人汽車夫中途被逐頭部跌傷甚重茲將詳情分錄於次</p>
<p>借汽車代步　劉彤雲年五十四歲甬籍現任愛多亞路山東路口春耕里四十五號富記洋紙號經理該號創立已十餘載營業雖稱發達然僅屬一日商富士造紙公司之掮客所獲佣金亦頗微末不過劉天性勤愼深得日人之信仰邇來富士公司因劉勤勞逾常故暫假與汽車一輛以次代步該汽車為轎式號碼六二三三號（巿二二一六號）</p>
<p>忽然有槍聲　劉闔宅關庽於法租界浦柏路四三四號昨日下午劉自家中外出先往廣東路十四號富士公司然後至春耕里直至晚間八時十分劉自富記由友人三五伴同至弄口擬乘車返寓詎甫入車中方與友人點首示別汽車夫楊阿福（四十四歲通州人）正擬踏動引擎時忽聞馬路對過大自嗚鐘捕房後門相近發一槍聲一響</p>
<p>車夫難抵抗　槍聲起處路旁突竄出綁匪五人各執手槍一躍登車一匪將槍指定汽車夫之口禁勿聲張三匪將劉挾於中央迫令開車汽車夫最初尚擬抵抗繼恐蹈前日金神父路范東山之覆轍遂撥動機紐向西開駛此時又突然槍聲五六響均皆向天開放故未傷及一人蓋附近四面皆有匪預伏惟恐訪處隣近捕房以便臨時拒捕也</p>
<p>友呆若木鷄　當時送劉諸友均皆佇立弄口呆若木鷄目送汽車西去而春耕里口之兩守門捕亦皆畏縮不前退入弄內以防流彈車抵鄭家木橋實裕里口一匪將汽車夫楊阿福逐下頭部跌傷甚重車仍向西駛去阿福當被該處崗捕查見詢明原委立即帶至大自嗚鐘捕房報告捕頭亟令探捕駕車緊追匪車已遠颺無踪汽車夫由探送仁濟醫院醫治</p>
<p>曾接嚇詐信　肇事後中央捕房聞訊立派中西探趕往查勘據該號職員云兩月前曾接到匪方嚇詐函一封圖索鉅欵函內措詞異常激烈但劉君亦未報告捕房日久遂亦漠然置之今竟遭綁實出意外現捕房已嚴密偵查但汽車截至今晨尚未發現</p>
<h3>十七歲少女　　　匪窟險遭槍斃</h3>
<p>王象義以三十元贖出</p>
<p>女感激涕零以身相許</p>
<p>鄰人尋獲竟不願回家</p>
<p>王品貌奇惡似非非類</p>
<p>面貌姣好　女子吳文龍年十七歲通州人面貌姣好世居原籍東門城外金沙鎭附近父母均全家道尚稱小康年來江北一帶匪共充斥殺人放火擄人勒贖無所不為居民稍有積蓄者一經若輩偵悉非搶刦即綁票文龍一家早為匪所垂涎得悉文龍已許字於人尚未過門乃父愛之如掌珠先則投函嚇許文龍之父榮連置諸不理匪等遂以最後手段於廢曆本年四月十一日黑夜前往吳家敲門榮連不察逕行開門出迎匪黨一哄而入將文龍由床上擄去臨行並令其父備金往贖</p>
<p>準備槍斃　文龍被擄後伊父以四鄉匪共擄人之事已司空見慣若即備價往贖匪等反以奇貨可居勒索鉅金不如暫且不理使匪黨認為無力回贖或有放還之希望故匪雖迭次來函催贖榮連莫不視為無聞而文龍以嬌艷之軀陷落匪窰難免不為匪等所蹂躪事逾一月匪黨以女父仍未前來接洽故於五月十二日將文龍提出意圖撕票放槍擊斃</p>
<p>贖得一命　有王象義者年二十六歲亦通州人當時將文龍由匪共槍下領出藏諸家中並對伊聲稱渠以不忍見無辜良女死於槍下故化洋三十元將汝贖出汝今後願何所歸文龍聆言認為絕大恩人感極而涕自願以身相許當時二人同居數日即遷來滬上住於楊樹浦平凉路附近王以拉黃包車為業但滬地生活程度高昂所入難以餬口勉强維持兩月早已吃盡當光遂有回籍之舉</p>
<p>來滬找尋　文龍父榮連探悉愛女已脫離匪窟為人領往上海故托鄰居季小麻皮來滬找尋季到滬後賃居於公共租界西藏路亦賴拉黃包車度日乘暇四出探訪文龍蹤跡無如地廣人密終無音信不得已仍返故鄉復命而王亦帶文龍離滬回籍私將家產變贖若干手頭經濟稍有寬裕於是摒擋一切再度來滬謀生</p>
<p>輪中相遇　前日男女二人由原籍輪埠搭乘通滬班寶華輪船來滬初不知季小麻皮仍啣女父之托二度到申探尋文龍事果遂願竟與文龍及王二人同舟來滬輪次彼此互相晤面遂囑文龍趕速歸去以免一家盻望不料文龍隨王日久宗旨改變當即表示願隨王同居回家之舉將有待之異日季聞言不與計較昨晨二時輪已抵滬王與文龍同雇一划船渡浦季亦雇舟尾隨同在爛泥渡口上岸季即嗚報崗警將王與女一併帶至三區</p>
<p>解官審訊　昨經張區長將三人提案預審先據季供稱因受隣居吳榮連之託兩度來申找尋其女今目的已達請准將文龍給領返籍等語詰據文龍供稱自在家被匪共擄去後初住鄉下居處東遷西移一無定址有時一日數遷以避官廳耳目匪黨莫不面目猙獰狀極可怖若輩秘密會議時將吾藏於密室自由盡被拘束任之所為蓋稍有掃抗恐送性命之故五月十二日匪等忽欲將吾槍斃眼見回生無望詎知救星驟臨由王象義仗義出洋三十元將我贖出得以死裏逃生王寶吾之救命恩人故此身願隨王處置家中雖極盻望將來終有團圓�</p>
<p>之一日惟暫不歸去云云</p>
<p>似非善類　又據王象義供述如何將文龍備價救出之情形與文龍所述大致相同區長以王品貌奇惡似非善類且是否將三十元贖出文龍尚難憑信或係掩飾之計亦未可知而其言詞之間似與匪共相熟故不特藏匿未滿二十歲之女子罪也已發更有牽涉反動嫌疑判將一干人併解公安局訊究</p>

<h3>愛的革命</h3>
<p>— 楊紹志</p>
<p>一個五幕劇　胡春冰著</p>
<p>一時代有一時代的文藝一個民族亦有一個民族的文藝一個民族進化到了這一個時代在這個當兒被急流啓示着自然就要顯露出這個民族在這個時代中的文藝的物質[一國的國民性為人認識與否與其國之文學有莫大之關係一時代之為人瞭解與否亦與其時代之文學有關]這是小泉八雲（Lafcadio　Hearn)嘗經鄭重地說過到了現在中國是怎樣的一個情形中國所需要的是那一種意識爽快地說出吧中國早已走上苦難的時期大部份的民衆也就因遭受着苦難而悲哀而趨於頹廢消沉的狀態之中了目下有一綫的期望就是最近在文藝壇中發現了一枝猛烈的生力軍在陰霾密佈的太空中放射出異樣的光芒標明挽救中華民族厄難的旗幟這是値得我們歡忻雀躍的</p>
<p>我們知道文藝是民族的火把燃燒着就能激發民族的思想加緊民族的情緒在苦難時代的中國在墮落頹廢的中華民族的病態中我們自然更應抖擻起精神來燃燒民族的火把來激發民族的思想來加緊民族的情緒文藝界看中了這個癥結的所在知道搖尾乞憐痛哭流淚的時期已經過去了我們要救中國我們要救中華民族唯一的方法就應把我們自己健全起來[愛的革命]就是含著這樣一個使命的文藝作品</p>
<p>「愛的革命」是一本五幕劇它完全以現時代為背景描寫革命情緒起伏期中反動勢力囂張的情形所謂帝國主義者眼中的中國人連　也不會哼的一種觀念寫得是都麼細膩深刻喲但它並不乾枯地完全描寫這種全武行的革命劇它是以此做本劇的中心意識攻訐帝國主義者欺騙和卑鄙的行為以外它更攻訐舊社會中的舊觀念更從情愛的事實攻訐得舊觀念舊勢力均體無完膚絕無茍延殘喘的餘地</p>
<p>劇本中的本事是以鍾三民做主角的鍾三民是個理智感情都很豐富的青年他的性情極剛毅而又勇敗心思極精密而又深切兼有革命的情緒可是他的父親却是個很馴服的洋奴當着洋行裏的買辦拿總經理洋大人奉着如太上皇一樣的看待而鍾家全部的人物除了三民以外都是同這位家主人一樣的頭腦甚至他的戚屬亦然這也可算是中國婚俗中所謂門當戶對的結果的吧</p>
<p>劇中的人物共有二三十人之多但各有特殊的格調也各能代表新舊社會交替期中的特徵雲松雲桂的輕佻潑辣雷媽朱二的老誠忠實愛華的活潑芳子的瀟洒更襯着自由之神的華自由處處逼露出眞情時時急流着勇敢熱烈的氣慨這樣一齣有聲有色的劇本在吾國創作劇中實難多得</p>
<p>在第一幕中的情節三民絕對不為利和色蠱惑了他的氣節他知道潮流已到了這個時期他正可以和帝國主義者的代表作一個殊死之戰看三民為祗求革命的成功不顧到父親的飯碗所在全家的收入所繋而竟然大罵着洋總經理阿迭生這樣的說我知道你這又作過官僚又作過軍閥的資本家是帝國主義者的代表你要知道我們要自由不是向你們搖尾乞憐的求你們恩惠我們是你們的錯誤收回我們應當有的權利如果我們應當有的權利你們也要把持靳而不與那我們就認清了帝國主義總是帝國主義只有打倒你們]這種勇敢的精神自然是値得宣揚的在二幕中他又這樣熱烈地高喊着[我深感覺到打倒帝国主義和洋奴階級必須從事國民革命先打倒軍閥和官僚於是我便毅然加入革命軍從事最前線的革命工作]同時在這劇本中又處處反照出帝國主義者代表的卑污行為如是自然更能相得益彰易於提醒一般人的觀念了</p>
<p>但是這個劇本亦可說是戀愛的紀實不過並不像一般描寫戀愛的作品着重在頹廢的一類腔調而本劇固然每篇中都有關於愛情的情節但他仍舊處處記住主要的中心意識他要求戀愛永久的勝利他覺得[我想我若愛自由我應該脫離我的家庭我若愛自由我應該剷除軍閥的勢力我若愛自由我應該打倒帝國主義者我正在繼續的努力自由呵」</p>
<p>— （華攝）</p>
<p>本劇的好處還多呌我這枝不慣介紹的筆墨來介紹實在會埋沒它原來的精彩還是請研究文藝的人們自去鑑賞吧總之我覺得這是一本時代的劇本這是完全以中國現時代來做背景以正當的意識來做中心的一個革命的劇本在鬧着現代劇本荒的中國所看到的祗有泊來品自然不會得迎合中國觀衆們的心理尤其是泊來品更不會得燃燒起中華民族的火把激發起民族的情緒為民族而奮鬥所以本劇之可取者在此本書之値得介紹者也在此我們知道今年是戲劇的年頭就上海話劇的公演總算是不少但每次給我們的感想多半是失望而回其中稍能差強人意的也袛有辛酉的難劇運動尚能付於觀衆們一種力使其相信自己是有希望的假使肯努力的向上但我還總覺得缺少明白而正當的意識根本的問題自然就因為缺乏劇本緣故現在旣開墾到了這樣的一個劇本就希望熱心文藝運動人們來努力地嘗試吧</p>

<h3>夜</h3>
<p>— 漱英</p>
<p>夜裏無論怎麼樣暗的夜總是有一種光采的夜的光采是極其柔和沉厚的有如沉默的好友他來了在無言相對中給你以溫煦的友情夜不僅給人以休息他給你以慰安</p>
<p>當白盡的餘影已經完全消滅你的心不想到過去的事故也不忖度將來只怛素地容納着一切眼前的印像—而誰不曾有過這樣的情境呢無論你是一個忙碌的商場中人是個藝術家是個為勞苦的的工人是個官吏或者是剛剛不曾聽到槍彈吼聲的兵士你這時候正彷佛在好天氣裏初醒過來有太陽暖柔的光線同着鳥聲一起融你身旁你的精神新鮮敏銳對於一切都好似第一次才感覺到但是沒有驚奇也沒有特殊的愛與憎而純然以內的心情去接受他們這時候你可以認識夜底一切了</p>
<p>在桌前有一盞燈這或許是電燈或許是煤油燈或許是古老時代的油燈都一樣總而言之是一種小力的光明的東西無論燈怎麼亮說是在你屋子裏懸上一盞兩百燭光的輕氣電燈泡罷但光明總不會足夠的你總覺得在窗子外面不他的臉正緊貼着玻璃窗呢有夜的眼睢閃着溫柔沉厚的光彩就在屋子裏面也是的燈光不過是一個生客到不熟識的渠厦裏來了無論他心裏怎麼樣想都跑遍一下但遺漏的總是太多太多呢在屋角落裏在桌子椅子旁邊在一切家俱器皿側面在你的手底下你的鼻子和耳朶附近你的睫毛中間夜靜靜地等在的兒一到他可以出來的時候立刻無聲走出來了正像一個太馴順了的妻子永遠輕輕伺在你旁邊看有沒有可以需要她的地方就是阿格棉家凱旋時的烽火是臨安元夜的春燈也絕不能把夜趕開去他絕不會遠離總總留在你的身邊</p>
<p>各種燈光自有其特殊的情調電燈當然是最明亮最便利的電燈給你一種熱鬧溫暖的情緒激動你的感情增加你的興趣但有時候使你感到空漠平板灰黃黯淡的電燈譬如說是街燈和廚房裏的燈則引起非常的冷落和恐怖煤氣燈大槪是最壞的了刺激似地動着你一種商業廣告之類的東西假如你要讀一點書不是消遣也不是學者似地旁徵博引而是聞靜地去領略書中意味或者你在寫一點文字雖沒有著述成家的意思而想要眞摯地表現出你的心情來那麼你最好是用一盞煤油燈煤油燈决沒有刺激你的光明僅僅在你的周圍緊緊貼住你身伴的周圍撤布一層光圈洽如你所需要那外面是一些親切的黑暗會撫慰着你的思想的煤油燈又在各處散布着活潑輕巧的影子作你沉思時的伴侶至於你在和良友深談愛人情話則一枝燭是最好的那些跳動的美麗的火燄燭光有着豐富的生命牠所投給物體的光影比之白熱的電光是顯然不同的臘燭我們古式的紅燭現在除掉敬神以外不再作別的用了但我總愛那一對閃爍的小火燄以非常親切的又帶有頑皮的樣子向你笑着就像你所熟識的那一對眼睛</p>
<p>關於燈光的事不要再講了罷燈光雖然可愛但夜的本身並不在此夜的無窮的誘惑也還不在於此呢我不是一個詩人不能夠把夜的神秘和他所有的星星都寫出來然而那裏面的東西是如此覺　就是像我這樣可憐的採集者也不會得不到一點收獲的</p>
<p>你把燈熄了暫時凝望着窗子若你不是與夜熟識的那你最先的驚該會是從窗戶外流進琮的不是黑暗反而是一種溫柔的光采如一陣輕麗的音樂洞簫提琴或者是小小的花園裏面少年婦人的歌聲燈光從你眼前消去並不是滅去了光明乃如從你眼前落了一層　幕代之的是一種更深的光明他們起先是輕輕地走進來有如怕驚動了主人隨後看出他們是可以被接待的立刻以一種溫雅的動作走遍了各處他們和一切物類是那樣熟識（因為夜和衆生萬物之間的感情是比之對於人要深厚得多的）立刻都融混在一起了夜正是一切物類的母親撫摩着他們慰藉着他們給他們加上美麗的顏色消滅了他們在生活中所受的一切傷痕打扮着他們使成為非常好看的東西在夜的柔和的光采中間醜惡已經沒有了你屋子裏尋常的傢俱破的桌子生了鏽斑的墻壁如今都成為圖畫而出現了現在他們都是有生命的東西了</p>
<p>你暫時凝望着窗戶夜的光采流進了你的眼睛流進了你的心這會使你忘記了日間一切所經過無論是歡樂或愛愁忘記了那些迫切地緾繞在你週圍的譬如社交業務應付日常生活之經營等等你暫時什麼也不想到使你的心純白無疵可以容受那些更其深入更其基本與你的靈魂接近的東西於是你便想起許多許多曾經深印在你的靈魂上但是為日常業務所掩蓋了的情緒你會想長那些大的小的事件在心靈上都有同等</p>

<p>印記的——一個曾經以全心身愛過的人一句落在你心頭的語言一道和你眼晴接觸過的眼波或者你曾在清晨偷偷地去探望過一朶含露半放的花蕊你的心禁不住躍動正如你躊躇於向一個小姑娘說（我愛你）的時候或者你在路傍所偶然看見的一個背影寂寞愉快頹唐美麗的一個背影以後却在你的想像你的靈魂裏生長交涉成了你熟識的朋友（夢裏和想像裏的人物也和生活中的一樣會變化成長消逝死滅的）或者你曾經激烈馳蕩拿你的血和生命去完成你的理想時所寫成的故事這些許是你久已忘記了的不沒有忘記誰能忘記那些已經在心靈上打了印記的東西無論是如何細微的呢他們不過休息在心的深處等得好的情境才再現出來這些者被靜夜的溫柔所引出在你臉上寫出微笑或寂寞但無論是微笑或寂寞罷那都是美麗的因為涵育在夜的美魔中</p>
<p>但是不要老坐在桌前不要老沉在深思裏你再去看看夜去投到夜的懷抱裏先走到窗前罷立刻會有一陳清鮮的氣息吹到你面上無論是夏天的凉爽或冬天的寒冽這於你都是適合的縱然是寒冷的冬天夜氣决不會使你難受那是一種非常清澈的東西有如雪花落到你掌上寒冷的刺激立刻可以使你精神興奮起來你開始向外面望你看見顏色和輪廓都融化了結成神秘的詩的顫動是的在夜的光采裏你可以覺到一種顫動如在發出美聲的琴絃上所覺到的一樣你所看見的形體在夜裏都是活動的他們靜靜地游行歌唱而且舞蹈幻化出無窮的美麗而這是一個黑暗的夜沒有月出沒有繁星（你在月和繁星的夜裏將感到更多的美）有很稀少的星星在天上𥅴眼這會引動你的眼睛抬向天上正遇到星星的光波有如你遇到了熟識的期待着的眼睛底光波一樣狗在遠處呌着平靜溫和蟋蟀在你近邊在窗子底下作着一種你所不知過的歌曲遠處的窗戶有燈光流出來如寶石的光彩在夏天流着清凉在冬天流着溫暖那些燈光正在和你密語告訴你一些輕密的美麗的言詞這時候醜惡苦難窘迫嫉妒仇恨人間的罪惡都暫時消滅了你的情緒是美的如夜的本身一樣美麗人類是兄弟人類和處生萬物都是兄弟呢</p>
<p>但是你不會在窗前久留的夜誘引着你跑到他完全的懷抱裏去去我也要了去呼吸夜的清新投身到含着微笑的草木中間那麼暫時中止了這篇短文等我轉來的時候再寫罷我相信那時會比現在寫得較好一點的</p>

<h3>The Election Tide in Various Countries</h3>
<p>In the past, during election periods in various countries, although competition was fierce, the greatest misfortune was only the occasional report of violations of election law leading to accusations. Now, it is not so. Whenever an election occurs, the contention between extreme factions is like warfare, and there are often acts of injury and death. The tragedies that unfolded during the recent German general election were countless. Now, in the election for the Mumbai Assembly in India, the obstruction of elections has led to the arrest of fifty women and eleven men. Furthermore, because police warnings were ineffective, one hundred people were injured by police batons, and three hundred and fifty were arrested. Every election inevitably sacrifices the lives and bodies of many people, and elections are no different from warfare.</p>
<p>Originally, the intent of elections was to abandon armed struggle and use peaceful competition. Unfortunately, the use of force also occurs during elections, which is to lose the original intent of elections. From this, we can infer that the method of elections also shows signs of reaching its peak and declining. Why? Peaceful elections are no longer sufficient to suppress the hearts of people who are rising up. The trend of the world is to promote the hearts of people rising up. The struggles of worldly affairs are becoming more intense, and the resentment accumulating among people is becoming greater. Even the advocacy of peace is ineffective.</p>

<h3>Sino-US Juridical Rights Issue</h3>
<p>The US will Gradually Give Up Extraterritoriality</p>
<p>The State Department has Drafted Measures</p>
<p>A Notification was Delivered to the Chinese Legation</p>
<p>Washington, 18th (National News Agency) - The US State Department announced today that the implementation measures for the abolition of consular jurisdiction have been drafted and are expected to be presented to China in mid-October. Although Chinese Minister Dr. Wu Chaoshu is away from the US, the State Department's notification regarding the above has been delivered to the Chinese Legation. It is reported that the content of the draft, although not a copy of the British proposal to China on September 11, is roughly similar. The purpose of this draft is for the US to gradually give up consular jurisdiction. The State Department also requested China to propose measures it has drafted for this matter.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Executive Council Holds Open Meeting</h3>
<p>Discussing Various Proposals</p>
<p>Geneva, 18th (National News Agency) - The new Executive Council of the League of Nations held its first open meeting today to discuss various proposals. One proposal is an agreement with the Swiss government for the use of radio stations in emergencies, with the League of Nations guaranteeing that no messages that undermine Swiss neutrality will be sent at that time. In addition, in the Disarmament Committee, a dispute between British and French opinions regarding the draft of a financial convention to support countries that have been invaded was resolved by the Dutch representative, who proposed a compromise stipulating that the Executive Council is authorized to provide financial assistance not only to countries that have already been invaded but also to those at risk of being invaded, as long as peaceful resolution has failed. It is now believed that after this difficult obstacle has been overcome, the case should proceed smoothly. However, in the Legal Committee, another wave of opposition has arisen regarding the drafting of new regulations for the Hague International Court. Led by Cuba, the Latin American republics of South America are vigorously opposing this move, insisting that the current regulations are working well and that the time to revise the regulations has not yet come until all issues related to the court have been fully resolved. The chairman's attempts at persuasion were ineffective, and as a result, it was decided to postpone this issue until next year. In addition, the Political Committee, due to the Greek representative's claim that there are still 30,000 Armenian refugees in the country requiring relief, resolved to organize an international refugee committee to handle the refugee problem. Geneva, 18th (Reuters) - The League of Nations Executive Council decided to convene a preliminary meeting on narcotics in London on October 27, which all countries producing narcotics will attend to discuss the allowable production quotas for each country. A full conference will be held next April for those who have signed the Geneva and Hague conventions.</p>
<p>Geneva, 19th (Reuters) - The League of Nations budget for the next fiscal year totals 29,966,000 gold francs, compared to 28,210,000 gold francs this year. The categorized budget is as follows: Secretariat and League of Nations special agencies, 16,505,000 gold francs; International Labour Office, 8,573,000 gold francs; International Court of Justice, 2,717,000 gold francs; Geneva construction, including the establishment of a radio station, 2,170,000 gold francs.</p>
<p>Geneva, 19th (Reuters) - The Graf Zeppelin airship suddenly arrived here this morning. When it flew at low altitude over the League of Nations Secretariat building, three committees were in session. The loud engine noise drowned out the voice of a certain translator in the committee room, so the meeting was adjourned. All representatives, the public, and journalists looked up to watch the airship soar.</p>
<p>Geneva, 18th (Pacific Press) - When the League of Nations Committee on Legal Issues discussed the organization of the International Court of Justice, the Greek representative argued with the Cuban representative because the amendment to the Court's organizational law had been approved by the entire body but had not been put into practice due to Cuba's opposition. The Cuban representative responded harshly and stated that his country might ratify the protocol on this matter. The committee then decided to deal with the matter on its merits and not to look back on the past.</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Sympathetic to China's Views</h3>
<p>It is Regrettable that China Failed to be Elected to the League of Nations Council</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (National News Agency) - The Deutsche Tageszeitung commented on the recent affairs of the League of Nations and the election of council members, saying that it was regrettable that China had not achieved its grand aspiration to be elected to the council, because China's large population, vast land, and important position did not result in election, so that only one country in Asia had a representative on the League of Nations Executive Council. This election result is extremely regrettable. It then solemnly stated that the German representative had voted for China and said that in next year's election, China's candidacy would no longer need to be restricted by a two-thirds majority vote, and it was confident that China's wishes would be fulfilled. The Diplomatic and Political News also had the same view.</p>

<p>Detained Women Have Been Released</p>
<p>Bombay, 18th (Reuters) - Although fifty women and twelve men were arrested today for obstructing the Bombay Council elections, the obstruction of election activities has not diminished slightly. The Home Rule Party shouted and laughed all day long without ceasing. The police warned them in vain and repeatedly used batons to disperse them, resulting in a hundred injuries and 350 arrests. There are three seats to be filled in the by-elections, and four are contesting them. Now, one of the four has announced his voluntary withdrawal in order to avoid clashes between the police and the demonstrators. As a result, voting and picketing have ceased naturally. The police have released all fifty detained women, but thirty men remain in custody. It has been found that there are 60,000 eligible voters in the Bombay district, but only 1,500 voted.</p>
<p>London, 18th (Reuters) - The chairman of the Round Table Conference on Indian issues has not yet been determined, but it is expected that British McDonald will chair the plenary session and observe the nature of the events discussed at the meeting.

<h3>Labor Unrest in Spain</h3>
<p>The Government Concentrates Large Forces to Suppress It</p>
<p>Madrid, 18th (National News Agency) - The labor unrest in Barcelona has not subsided. The Spanish government has concentrated large forces to suppress it.

<h3>France Discusses New Budget</h3>
<p>Expenses of Various Ministries Will Be Reduced</p>
<p>Paris, 18th (National News Agency) - Today, the French government held a cabinet meeting in front of President Doumer to announce the new budget for the coming year in order to submit it to the parliament. The estimated income and expenses are 503 billion francs each, a decrease of 30 billion francs compared to this year's budget. Except for the expenses of the army and navy, which cannot be reduced due to national security reasons, the expenses of other ministries have been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Paris, 18th (Reuters) - The French Cabinet meeting proposed to limit the budget for 1931-1932 to 50,000,000,000 francs, deciding not to increase the burden on taxpayers and to save spending by 300,000,000 francs compared to the existing budget. This is the first time France has cut government spending since 1926.</p>
<h3>Accident of Japanese Naval Aircraft</h3>
<p>Seven Crew Members Rescued</p>
<p>Nagasaki, 19th (Telecommunications Agency) - On the 18th, the Omura Naval Air Corps, under the command of Lieutenant Miyazaki, led three attack aircraft to the Kagoshima area. Due to excessive wind and rain, they repeatedly touched down in the water between the Kosiki and Kume Islands, letting them drift. The seven crew members on board sent out an SOS. A search plane team discovered them. The Air Corps immediately dispatched aircraft to transport food. Sasebo also dispatched five destroyers to search all night. At dawn this morning, Sasebo and Omura dispatched six more aircraft to conduct a major search by sea and air, but they have not yet been found. It was assumed that the seven crew members had shared their fate with the aircraft. However, at 11:00 this morning, an aircraft discovered seven crew members on a life raft in the sea south of Kosiki Island and immediately rushed to rescue them. All seven were extremely exhausted due to hunger and cold after a day and night, but fortunately, they were all unharmed. The aircraft seems to have sunk, and it has not been found nearby.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Movement in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Advocating for Restrictions on Japanese Immigration</p>
<p>Manila (World News Agency) - Recently, the anti-Japanese movement in the Philippines has been quite intense, causing the Japanese expatriates there to feel distressed. The reason for the anti-Japanese movement is due to the expansion of the power of Japanese expatriates on Davao Island. There are about 16,000 Japanese expatriates on the island, all of whom are engaged in agriculture and are firmly united. 120,000 acres of the most fertile farmland on the island are now under their control, and the commercially important port of Davao is almost entirely controlled by the Japanese. Almost all imports and exports are to Japan and the Japanese South Sea Islands. Therefore, Philippine government officials believe that the expansion of Japanese expatriate power on the island is enough to threaten the political integrity of the Philippines. To correct this problem, it is necessary to restrict Japanese expatriates. In the future, immigration to the Philippines will be limited, and the power of Japanese will be reduced by using the United States' national rights over the Philippines. To maintain their inherent rights and interests, the Japanese are prepared to resist. Philippine Governor-General Davis considered this matter important and personally sailed to the island last month to inspect it in order to clarify the truth and determine the government's policy.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Trotsky May Return to Russia</h3>
<p>Soviet Russian Officials Consider it a Rumor</p>
<p>Vienna (World News Agency) - It was recently reported in Central Europe that Trotsky, the former leader of the Russian Communist Party, suddenly left the Turkish island of Prinkipo and went to Czechoslovakia. All parties were shocked upon hearing this news. This report was first reported from Budapest, the capital of Hungary, claiming that Trotsky also intends to return to Russia and is currently planning to meet with former Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Chicherin and Education Minister Lunacharsky in Franzensbad, Czech Republic. According to officials at the Czech Embassy in Vienna, Lunacharsky has gone there. According to Trotsky, who has been living on Prinkipo Island for a year and a half, those who visited him last year said that he would not leave Turkey immediately. If there is indeed a plan to return to Russia this time, its significance must be very great. However, Soviet Russian diplomats stationed in Vienna strongly stated that this statement is purely a rumor.</p>
<h3>Netherlands Tests Secret Telephone</h3>

<h3>Ninety-Fourth State Council Meeting</h3>
<p>The National Government held its ninety-fourth State Council meeting from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM on the 19th. The attending members were Lin Sen, Hu Hanmin, Wang Chonghui, Chen Guofu, Sun Ke, Zhu Peide, and Tan Yankai, chaired by Tan Yankai. The resolutions were as follows: (1) The Executive Yuan presented a request from Niu, the acting minister of the Ministry of the Interior, to allocate funds to provide relief to overseas Chinese who were victims of the fire in Pontianak, the capital of the western district of Dutch Borneo, Nanyang. It was found that the overseas Chinese in that city had a long-standing enthusiasm for supporting the revolution and suffered greatly from the fire. It is proposed that the government issue a clear order instructing the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send consuls stationed there to investigate the disaster and express condolences to the victims, and to allocate funds for relief. The resolution was approved. (2) The resolution to approve the resignation of Cai Yuanpei, the president of National Peking University. Chen Daqi was appointed to act as president in his place. (3) The resolution to approve the resignation of Sun Ke, the president of National Chiao Tung University, from his concurrent post. Li Zhaohuan was appointed as the president. (4) The resolution to remove Yi Peiji from his concurrent post as president of National Labour University. (5) Yan Zhuang, a counselor of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, was transferred to serve as the director of the Labour Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Zhu Maocheng, the original director of the Labour Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, was transferred to serve as a counselor of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. (6) It was resolved to appoint Zhang Qun, Li Zhonggong, Chen Xizeng, Guo Le, Huang Hanliang, Li Guojie, and Wang Yansong as members of the Committee for the Management of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company of the National Government, designating Zhang Qun as the chairman and Li Zhonggong as the commissioner of the general management office of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company.</p>
<h3>Central Propaganda Department Hosts the Press</h3>
<p>Fang Juehui Reports on Impressions of Traveling in Europe</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon (the 18th) at 2:00 PM, the Central Propaganda Department hosted the press, inviting over twenty reporters from various Beijing and local Beijing-based news agencies. Secretary Zhang Tingxi presided, extending greetings before introducing Central Committee member Fang Juehui, who reported briefly, stating that all report materials from the trip to Europe were entrusted to a forwarding company and have not yet arrived. Today, he will simply offer a brief report on his impressions from visiting various countries, consisting of five points: (1) The intense patriotism in each country. Every country he visited universally avoids foreign goods. Even the American mail ship from Shanghai to the United States does not purchase foreign goods because all the food</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>supplies used are prepared in their own country. Taking one piece of fruit from Kobe to the United States will incur a fine of fifteen yuan because the American continent is abundant with fruit and does not allow foreign goods to encroach. When switching to a German ship in the Atlantic, all the supplies used on board are German goods. Continental Europe has many small countries, and one can travel through several countries in a day. Everywhere he went, only their own national goods were used. Their methods of resisting foreign goods are all extreme. There are also no foreign goods in the markets of each country. If there are any, they are all subject to heavy protective taxes to show resistance. However, the Chinese stores seen along the way are full of foreign goods; otherwise, they would not be considered stores. What is even stranger is that Chinese silver dollars, copper coins, and banknotes are all printed with English characters. Although this matter is small, its implications are significant and we must pay attention to it. (2) The consistency of diplomatic administration in each country. Traditional diplomats are not used because the political parties and countries in Europe and America each have their own party policies and functions. For example, once U.S. President Hoover takes office, all foreign envoys and consuls are replaced to implement his party's agenda, so he must use the talents of his own party. Mussolini in Italy also uses this method. As for revolutionary countries, such as Turkey, its ambassadors to France and Germany are all wounded senior military officers. This is also a method of implementing their consistent policy. Their revolutionary diplomacy has a specific policy, with not losing national rights as the principle. (3) The restrictions on sending students abroad in each country. European and American countries send students abroad based on the needs of diplomacy, commerce, and various technologies, unlike China, which has no restrictions. Mr. Dai Jitao’s book "On Japan" includes statistics showing that China has sent over 100,000 students to Japan and over 17,000 to Europe and America, totaling over 117,000 people. Provinces and localities all have dispatching offices, and most of the students sent are around twenty years old, with no basic knowledge. After studying abroad for several years, they almost forget their own country and only learn a little superficial knowledge from others. Now China should unify the system of studying abroad, and the central government should decide on dispatching based on the needs of talent. Those dispatched must have basic knowledge before they can study abroad. The state should also be responsible for employing them after they return; otherwise, wouldn't the 30 million yuan that China sends out each year to support students be wasted on foreign countries? The methods used by foreign countries to send students abroad are that the ages are all over thirty or forty, and only after graduating from university and serving for several years with experience can they be sent abroad to study. After completing their studies, they must undergo a training period before they can be officially employed. This is very different from China. (4) The strictness with which each country levies taxes on foreign travelers. European and American countries levy a population tax on foreigners entering and leaving the country. The United States charges eight U.S. dollars per person, Germany six marks per person, and France twenty francs per person. This income is already considerable. There are also passport taxes and freight value certification taxes. For example, if Germany ships goods to Japan, it must be thoroughly investigated by the Japanese ambassador to Germany and a freight value certificate issued, with a tax of one or two percent deducted. China is completely different. There is no population tax. The passport tax has been drafted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is being planned for implementation. The freight value certification tax has never been implemented. If these three things can be implemented, it can generate more than 100 million yuan in revenue per year. Why worry about insufficient diplomatic expenses? This is a sovereign right that our country should have, and there are no unequal treaty provisions, so why worry about not being able to implement it? This is also one of the differences between China and foreign countries. (5) Observations of Soviet Russia. He passed through Russia for more than ten days, but the markets in various places were bleak and desolate. The people on the streets are workers wearing old clothes. Their exclusion of foreign goods is extreme nationalism. Russian workers are absolutely subject to the method of allocating food and clothing to the people. It is said that in 1918, the Communist Party nationalized the land of the large Russian landlords. The land of small and medium-sized farmers was not confiscated. The new economic policy was not determined until 1922. The current five-year economic plan is based on this principle. After the land of the large landlords was confiscated, private serfs became national serfs. All production belongs to the state, and then the state issues small booklets to receive bread and other items. For small and medium-sized farmers, the state collects part of their surplus, just like the method of allocating food between landlords and tenants in China. Food is issued once a day. Everywhere we went, we saw that clothes for receiving bread were issued twice a year. Everyone has extremely little freedom in all aspects of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. All rights are deprived. There are about 50,000 to 60,000 Chinese workers in Russia. These people will never be able to escape for the rest of their lives. To sum up, the above five items are completely opposite between China and foreign countries. This is something we must pay twelve points of attention to. Moreover, as the ancient Chinese books say, "Shame not to be like others is great," and "Cultivate shame." These words are not wrong at all. When I arrived in Sweden from Norway, the money for selling newspapers was left on the street, but no one picked it up because foreigners regard it as a great shame to take what is not earned by their own labor, unlike China today, where everyone picks up money and ignores shame, like robbers. This matter is very important to the national culture, and the education of cultivating shame in a nation is also urgently needed. The meeting was adjourned after the report.</p>
<h3>He Jian Will Go to Zhuzhou and Liling to Supervise the Troops</h3>
<p>Pursuing the Remnants of Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang</p>
<p>Changsha correspondence: After the communist bandits Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, etc. secretly left the Changsha area on the 14th and fled towards the Hunan-Jiangxi border, most of their armed soldiers fled from Datuo Shop, Yijiawan, Zhuzhou, and Liling near Changsha to Pingxiang. Only a small portion of Peng and Huang's armed soldiers and tens of thousands of the Liuping Red Guards (all spear teams) fled from Tiaomajian and Yongan City to the Liuping lair. After receiving the report, He Jian immediately convened a military meeting at the headquarters on the 15th to discuss the pursuit plan. Wang Dongyuan, Peng Weiren, Li Jue, Tao Guang, Gong Bingfan, Luo Lin, and others all attended. It was decided to pursue and intercept them separately, and a deadline of the 16th was set for mobilization and departure for separate suppression. In addition to ordering other units to be on alert in southern Hunan and deploying the reserve and reserve teams separately, a telegram was sent to the Jiangxi army to block them. Once the plan was set, Chen Guang's central unit crossed the river on the 16th to Yijiawan and pursued Liling. That night, they camped in Zhuzhou. Luo Lin's unit also departed from the province to Liling early on the 16th and camped in Yijiawan that night. Li Jue's unit reached Tiaomajian on the 16th and decided to pursue Yongan City on the 17th. He Jian, because most of the bandits fled to Liling and Pingxiang, anticipated a fierce battle above Liling and below Pingxiang, so he decided to personally go to Zhuzhou and Liling to supervise the troops the day after tomorrow. As for the whereabouts of the communist bandits after their escape, at 7:00 AM on the 16th, Zhang Yuheng, leader of the 5th Aviation Team, accompanied pilot Yang Xialin on the Dallas No. 2 aircraft to inspect Chen's territory. According to the report to the authorities: (1) About 20,000 to 30,000 bandits have fled from Liling along the railway line to Chudong Bridge in Yidong, and then divided into three routes to Pingxiang: one along the railway line, one from Jinhanchong in the north of the road via Lingguan, and one from Dingjiafang in the south of the road via Fenshui'ao. Their vanguard has crossed Laoguan, and the tail is still in Chuan Chongpu. Their actions are hurried and their order is very chaotic. (2) On the railway at Yingtao Ridge in eastern Liling, there are hundreds of female bandits carrying luggage, following the bandit team. Upon closer inspection, they appear to be cement bags, about 2,000 to 3,000 bags. Several 120-pound bombs were dropped on the densely packed bandit troops, killing hundreds of them. The survivors fled in panic. (2) Two to three hundred bandits in Zhuzhou City fled to Liling in two routes: one along the railway and one from the small road east of Zhutianpu, Shufangchong, and Wen Yijiawan. There are about one hundred bandits heading towards Longtoupu. There are about one hundred bandits heading towards Youmachong on the main road of Tianxinpu and Liumuqiu. The above scattered bandits are all in groups of three to five, in a very embarrassed state. (4) The troops on our southeastern front have advanced with flags, and Laomiao and Langli City have also been occupied by our army. The remaining pursuing troops have all reached their designated locations. Their actions are extremely excited, and the bandit troops are already surrounded. (September 17th)</p>
<h3>A Tragic Village Burning Incident by Bandits in Anqiu, Shandong</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Jiaodong bandits north of the railway currently still include a force led by Liu Yongquan in Guangrao. Liu's unit was originally the Guangrao Garrison Team and is currently negotiating reorganization. The bandit leader Wang Ziming, south of the railway, was originally a remnant of Zhang Zongchang. Gathering over a thousand people, he suddenly attacked Jingzhi Town in the southeastern township of Anqiu on the night of the 12th, setting fires and killing people. For a time, the firelight illuminated the sky, and the sounds of shouting, killing, and weeping could be heard for dozens of miles. This town is famous for producing white wine and is ten times richer than Anqiu City. It has over two hundred militia members, all equipped with firearms. Only sixty people escaped that night, and the fate of the rest is unknown. The villagers came to the province the other day to appeal. The general headquarters immediately telegraphed the 58th Brigade of the 20th Division of the 12th Army stationed in Jiaoxian to suppress them. Yesterday, Zhan's brigade had a fierce battle with the bandits near Songguantuan Village near Jingzhi. The details are unknown. Gao Guizi's Gao Jianbai Brigade, which broke through from Zhucheng, has now fled to the southeastern coast of the city and is being recruited by Shen Honglie, who is sending warships. Gao's unit has not caused any disturbance to the local area. As for Zhang Huizhao's Jin army unit in Wenshang, it is still surrounded by Chen Xiaosi's 2nd Police Brigade. There are no Jin troops south of the Yellow River. (September 16th)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Banquet Merchants Still Suspended Awaiting Decision</h3>
<p>Banquet Merchants Request to Self-Manage Banquet Donations</p>
<p>Provincial Government Agrees to Improve Joint Order Penalties</p>
<p>Three Chambers of Commerce to Mediate</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the Guangzhou Restaurant Association opposed the implementation of joint orders for donation merchants and suspended business, ten days have passed. The banquet merchants have repeatedly petitioned various agencies, but no results have been achieved. The banquet merchants are very determined to oppose joint orders. On the 11th, they again petitioned the provincial and municipal party departments. The party department only agreed to forward the letter to the provincial government for early resolution. In the afternoon, they went to the Finance Department to petition. The Finance Department sent Yang, the third section chief, to receive them on their behalf. On this day, the attitude of the banquet merchants changed slightly, and they requested that if the authorities could not abolish the joint order case, they should return the banquet donation to the Restaurant Association for self-management. Finance Minister Fan Qiwu immediately replied as follows: (1) Explain how the joint order hinders progress so that it can be improved. (2) After the joint order is implemented, more than 800,000 yuan in banquet donations can be collected each year. If the self-management is taken back, an annual quota of 800,000 yuan should be recognized. Afterwards, the banquet merchants returned to convene a meeting. Whether the merchants can pay 800,000 yuan is still under investigation before self-management can be taken back. Now it seems that the banquet merchants have no choice but to rest and await a decision. As for the official government, they do not want to withdraw the order on using joint orders for donation merchants because the funds are involved. They still insist on implementing the original plan and will only make some revisions to the joint order penalties to comply with emotions. This method has already been seen in yesterday's provincial government instructions. The provincial government's statement said (District Jingming and others from the restaurant and tea room association have requested the release of three detained colleagues and the cancellation of the joint order, and the details are known. The Nanjing Municipal Government also has this method of banquet donation joint orders for restaurants to comply with, which is no different. This time, the province's finances should approve the use of the two joint orders, which is not very different. The petition only says that the joint order is difficult to implement and does not clearly point out the difficult facts. How can they dare to suspend business and gather crowds to coerce? The Finance Department has been instructed to reduce the penalties. If there are errors in the procedures and disputes arise, fairness must be maintained. Each of the merchants has assets and capital, and they should all continue to operate as usual and not suffer losses from being incited by others. The government has high hopes. As for Lin Ji and others, they have already been released by the department and returned to business. Let everyone know.) After the provincial government's reply, the City Business and Civilian Association, the General Chamber of Commerce, and the City Chamber of Commerce, three organizations, believed that the unresolved suspension of business by the banquet merchants was affecting the commerce of all industries. Yesterday, they specially sent a letter to the Restaurant and Tea Room Association, instructing them to send people to the Chamber of Commerce to state the situation in order to mediate.

<h3>Plague Discovered on the Siping-Taonan Railway</h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The news that the plague has been discovered along the Siping-Taonan Railway is spreading. According to a telephone call received by the Eastern Railway Medical Office from Qiqihar on the 12th, the Taonan Railway Bureau received a confirmed report that twelve people have died of the plague in a place eight kilometers from Taonan in the past two days. Also, several people with suspected plague have been discovered in a certain village. Five people have died not far from the South Manchuria Railway along the Sipingjie Railway. The government has now banned people from traveling to the area. The Taonan Railway Bureau has sent doctors to investigate the truth. After receiving the report, the Eastern Railway immediately sent four specialized members of the Medical Office to investigate on the 13th. At the same time, the South Manchuria Railway also issued a notice to rectify the epidemic prevention team and prepare to depart for the three northeastern provinces if necessary. Yesterday, it urgently telegraphed Wu Liande, an epidemic prevention expert residing in Shanghai, to return quickly in order to find ways to prevent the Harbin epidemic. Harbin has experienced two outbreaks of pneumonic plague in 1910 and 1920, and tens of thousands of people died from the epidemic, which is still talked about today. Dr. Burke, a representative of the Health Department of the League of Nations, came to Harbin and talked about how people around the world know that the Manchurian plague occurs every ten years based on past experience. This year is 1930, and I am afraid that the ten-year revival period is approaching. Although his words are not entirely believable, if the plague has recently been discovered, perhaps this saying will come true. Regarding this matter, according to Shi Jiliang, a medical officer from the Epidemic Prevention Office of the Three Northeastern Provinces, the two plagues in 1910 and 1920 were both pneumonic plague, which is easily transmitted through the air and is very fierce, and the area is quite large. This time, the bubonic plague has been discovered near Sitai Road, Pujia Town, Taipingchuan, Kaitong, and Tongliao, where Mongolian villages are located. Fortunately, it is all bubonic plague and will not be as fierce as pneumonic plague. However, more than twenty people have died. The cause is due to the transmission of rat fleas. Rats become infected, and fleas suck their blood and absorb the plague toxin, and then transmit it by biting people, causing the plague. However, after the bubonic plague becomes septicemic in severe cold weather, it turns into pneumonic plague. The Epidemic Prevention Office has sent medical officer Wang Yizhen, along with the Sitai Road medical officer, to do their best to fight the epidemic, and has taken a large amount of serum and plague antibody. If necessary, the epidemic prevention team will also continue to depart. (September 13th)</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Tobacco Planting in Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>Wei Lihuang Orders All Counties</p>
<p>Violators Will Be Subject to Military Law</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Northern Anhui is the most famous area for tobacco production. Over the years, the authorities have mostly adopted a policy of concealing the prohibition through taxation, which has only helped to increase drug abuse. This summer, Wei Lihuang, the commander of the Northern Anhui Garrison, was ordered to collect a tobacco seedling tax, which was originally intended to supply military needs for a time. Now that the tobacco seedling tax is about to be completed, it is time to strictly prohibit planting of the poisonous crop. Yesterday, he specially telegraphed the twenty-six counties in northern Anhui to strictly prohibit planting. Violators will be subject to military law. The original telegram reads: Urgent. To the magistrates of the twenty-six counties in northern Anhui: I have learned that opium and drugs harm the country and the people, and this is extremely serious. I have repeatedly received strict orders from the central government to suspend and strictly prohibit this. However, I have found that the counties in northern Anhui have not completely prohibited it. The reason is either that the county magistrates have not made enough effort to prohibit planting or that ignorant and foolish people are greedy for profit. If this is not reduced, production will increase and become a hotbed for bandits, causing great harm and endless poison. This commander is in charge of the military in northern Anhui and is heartbroken by what he sees. Now that the planting season is approaching, it is imperative to solemnly announce and strictly enforce military law. The following items are listed separately: (1) If any county magistrate or township or district chief violates the order or conceals the truth, they will be deemed to have failed to implement the order and will be sentenced to death. (2) If the people disobey the prohibition and still dare to plant, those who plant will be shot and the land will be confiscated. (3) If county magistrates or district chiefs are transferred in the future, they must also be prosecuted according to the law and will not be allowed to escape the law. (4) You are hereby ordered to immediately print 500 copies of the announcement in each county and post them in various townships and districts so that the public is aware of the strict prohibition. You are also ordered to report within one month for record. Wei Lihuang, Commander of the Northern Anhui Garrison and Commander of the Provincial Bandit Suppression. (September 16th)</p>
<h3>There is Hope for a Turnaround in the Zhenjiang Market</h3>
<p>Jiangbei Station Will Be Moved to Beigushan</p>
<p>Water and Land Trade Can Restore Its Former Glory</p>
<p>Zhenjiang is one of the treaty ports, and its commerce has always been prosperous. After the Jinpu Railway opened to traffic, the situation shifted and trade gradually declined. Furthermore, because the Jiangtan beach was silted up, Jiangbei cargo ships could not connect with Jiangbei Station to load and unload goods. Goods were transferred directly at Huojia Bridge in Yangzhou. The commerce of this port plummeted. Local people discussed relief at the time and agreed on two methods: palliative and fundamental. The former would extend Jiangbei Station to Zhenjiang Customs, and the latter would extend it from Nanmen Station to Beigushan. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce presented the proposal to the central government for adoption. This spring, Liu Weichi, director of the Railway Bureau, was sent by the Ministry of Railways to Zhenjiang to survey the situation. He believed that extending Jiangbei Station to the front of the Customs was completely a temporary solution and not a fundamental method. The plan to extend it from Nanmen to Beigushan was limited to economics and could not be implemented immediately. Later, Gao Zifang sought another way to extend it from Gaozi Station to Jiangbei Station for loading and unloading goods, because the route was short and it was easier to handle through the province. The Railway Bureau already had the intention of prioritizing the easier option. When the business community in Zhenjiang heard about this, they actively fought for it. The Railway Bureau, in view of the decline of the Zhenjiang market, decided that it could no longer withstand the blow and decided to extend the route to Beigushan. However, the funding issue was still difficult to resolve. At the time, the Railway Bureau requested that all construction costs be borrowed from the Zhenjiang merchants at interest and repaid from railway revenue. The Zhenjiang business community believed that the amount was too large and difficult to answer immediately. The matter was shelved for several months without a solution. Now, because the Ma Route from the Provincial Capital of Zhongzheng to Beigushan directly passes through Nanmen, Nanmen Station was expanded on the 15th of this month, and express trains stop at the station day and night to pick up and drop off passengers. Extending the route to Beigushan is likely to be realized. On the afternoon of the 18th, Liu Chengshi, Director of the Car Management Office, Xu Chaoyuan, Director of the Beijing Resident Section, and Tang Bingnan, Director of the Resident Office Section, were specially dispatched to Zhenjiang to meet with Yin Zhiluo, a Zhenjiang-based engineer. (The drawings for setting up a station at Beigushan were drawn by Engineer Yin four years ago.) Chen Zhongying, the director of the Zhenjiang-based section, contacted the Chamber of Commerce. Lu Yu and Liang, both standing committee members, accompanied him to inspect the area around Nanmen Station. They then took a car to Beijing at 7:30 PM. It is reported that Director Liu came to Zhenjiang this time specifically to contact the business community for borrowing construction funds. It is estimated that the total cost will be 700,000 yuan (four years ago it only cost 400,000 yuan). The Railway Bureau can raise up to 200,000 yuan, and the rest must be borrowed from Zhenjiang. If the loan negotiations are successful, construction can begin. In the future, the station will be located east of Beigushan. The collection of freight and all other plans must wait until the Railway Bureau has thoroughly investigated the total amount of trade in customs import and export station transportation and Jiangbei Yangzhou's Cuijia Bridge Tax Office in the last three years before a decision can be made. The Railway Bureau also plans to build a shipyard at Beigushan at the same time to facilitate the berthing of ships. Once this matter is realized, the Daxiaochang area will become the most prosperous commercial area in Zhenjiang.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Xin Song Min Bao is Ordered to Cease Publication. The Xin Song Min Bao in this city has not been published for long. The external reporter, Chen Chaozhi, has been swindling and cheating, which has greatly damaged the credibility of society. The county party department previously sent a letter of warning, but the reporter even impersonated a public security bureau official and committed fraud. He has been accused and is on the run. The county party department has repeatedly received reports from the public and has decided on the following measures in a standing committee meeting: (1) Transfer the case to the Public Security Bureau to quickly arrest and prosecute Chen Chao. (2) The newspaper's employment of unqualified personnel who swindle and cheat and fabricate news to confuse the public should be ordered to cease publication. If they disobey, they will be sealed up.</p>
<p>Zhelin's Poor Harvest and Autumn Survey Situation. The county government and the finance bureau have both received reports from Zhelin and other places stating that the autumn harvest has been poor and requesting verification. They ordered Clerk Hou to go for inspection. Now, it is reported that Zhelin's second, third, fourth, and fifth districts have experienced hail, and the replanted kapok trees have grown more slowly and only yielded a third of the harvest compared to previous years. Also, Yang Mugen and Xu Guixiang reported that the tenth and sixteenth districts were barren. According to the district chiefs, this was not the case. It is known that Zhelin's poor harvest should be notified to the district chiefs to instruct the township police to create a roster and notify the business owners for re-examination to ensure verification.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Accusation of Corruption in Pingzhen. Chen Zhiwen, the district chief of the ninth district of the county, is a graduate of the second training session. He was impeached for corruption in Pingzhen shortly after taking office. The Pingzhen General Bureau has decided to transfer the case to the county government for severe punishment. Now, Tang Xiuyu and others, representatives of the poor people's group in the tenth district of Cao Yanbang, have telegraphed the provincial and county authorities, stating that Chen Zhiwen, the district chief of the ninth district, has embezzled the poor's grain. They have already telegraphed to accuse him. Now, because the district colluded with local tyrants to divide the remaining grain in order to destroy the evidence, they immediately requested the county party department to send personnel to seize 18 packages in the Zhu family's home and 5 packages sold to the rice shop. It is found that the district chief dared to embezzle the poor's grain and colluded with local tyrants such as Sun and Zhu to divide and occupy the grain, disregarding the hunger of the poor people. He has no conscience at all and should be handed over to the Songjiang County Court to be arrested and severely investigated in order to punish corruption. The case has attracted considerable attention from society.</p>

<p>Telegraphic Request to Pursue the Nanmacun Robbery Case. Nanmacun in Yanmu District of Wujiang County was robbed by bandits from Daguan Lake on the 10th of this month. The case of 24 robbed shops losing more than 10,000 yuan has not yet been solved. Yesterday (19th), Wu Zhong, the county magistrate of Wujiang, telegraphed the Third District of the Water Public Security Bureau again, requesting that a team be sent to pursue the bandits. After approving the telegram, the district chief immediately telegraphed the fourteenth and fifteenth teams to dispatch teams in separate routes to encircle and suppress the bandits.</p>
<p>Bandits in Dianshan Lake are on the Run. Yesterday, about 400 to 500 bandits from Pudong Gang also fled to the vicinity of Chefang Chenmu in the county, intending to cause trouble. Nie Ziyang, the director of the 12th Public Security Bureau of Chefang, reported to the County Public Security Bureau and reported to the County Government for arrest. After receiving the report, County Chief Huang, in addition to ordering the police chief to lead the police to encircle and suppress the bandits, also telegraphed the Third District of the Water Public Security Bureau to order the team to assist in the pursuit. The district chief immediately ordered Xu Boying, the captain of the eleventh team, to lead the team to rush there. However, when the police team arrived at the location, the bandits fled towards Dianshan Lake.</p>

After receiving the report, the county government was preparing to send police to the village to make the arrest. However, the Public Security Bureau also suddenly received a secret tip that Yu Lunzhi was involved in opium trafficking. Upon receiving the report, Director Xu secretly dispatched Detective Team Leader Shen Minhua and Detective Tang Yaoting to the village at about 7 a.m. yesterday to arrest him at the address provided.

<p>Private Salt Ship Seized at Wutang Gate: Wutang Gate in Kaihua Township is an important passage to Taihu Lake. The waterway is complex and notoriously dangerous. The other day, dozens of private salt ships were suddenly discovered there, arriving in a large group. At that time, the patrol boats of the Third Squadron of the Seventh Anti-Smuggling Brigade and the Gao Patrol Team were passing through the area. They immediately reported to headquarters and gathered more than 50 patrol boats to surround the smugglers. Under the command of Dong Songyuan, Deputy Squadron Leader of the Third Squadron, and Huang Zhenou, Captain of the Gao Patrol Team, the patrol boats bravely launched an encirclement and suppression operation. After an exchange of gunfire, the private salt ships could not resist and threw their salt into the lake, scattering in all directions. As a result, two salt ships and dozens of bags of private salt were seized near Daijia Village and have been escorted to the city for Director Wu Hanzhuang of the brigade to handle according to the law.</p>
<p>Opposition to Taking Over the Labor Hospital: The Ministries of Industry and Commerce and Health, recognizing Wuxi as a region with developed factories, have specially designated it as an industrial and health zone, dispatching personnel to organize a Health Promotion Association to specifically handle workers' health matters.

The night before last, he hired a boat to transport 12 stones of brown rice to Changshu for sale. Unexpectedly, at about 4 a.m. the next morning (the 18th), as dawn was breaking and the boat was passing the Panjiazhakou area of Kuncheng Lake outside Xiaodongmen, it was suddenly encountered by a bandit boat with six or seven strong men. They boarded Qian's boat and searched it thoroughly, finding nothing. As a result, they robbed half of the brown rice on the boat and abducted Qian Dingyuan. However, when they realized that Qian had no money to be redeemed, they released him and then disappeared into the lake. By then, it was already broad daylight.

(2) The position of the bullet was incorrect. (3) The wounds were different. If it was suicide in bed, there would be no bullet holes in the wall or curtains behind the bed. (4) The bleeding was incorrect. In short, Wencai was shot to death in his sleep, and the gun was placed beside him. Fu Xueni and others claimed that Wencai committed suicide. Miao Yougang also presented several points of view. After the interrogation, County Magistrate Li instructed Ma Yiyong that the case was currently under investigation.

<p>Record of the Interrogation of the District Chief's Extortion Case: Wu Kai, the former chief of the Eighth District of Gaoyou, was jointly accused by Zou Chang Shen Maonian, a village head from Yufu Township, Shen Dejiu, a village guard, and Wu Yucheng, the head of Manyang Township, of extortion and intimidation in a complaint filed with the county government. Yesterday (the 16th), Hu Chengren opened a court session to summon the plaintiffs, defendants, and witnesses for the plaintiffs, Chen Shuchun, and the witness for the defendant, Xu Tinggui, to appear in court for interrogation. According to Shen Dejiu, on August 10th, the district chief summoned me and asked me who was posting the "Yellow Oriole" notices. I said I didn't know. Finally, he gave me three days to hand over the person who posted the "Yellow Oriole" notices. On the night of August 14th, the district chief ordered the district guard to call me and said that the district chief wanted to talk to me. Because it was late, I said to the district guard, "It's late tonight, I'll see the district chief tomorrow." After the district guard left, three or four district guards came again and arrested me and took me to the district office to ask if I had found the person who posted the "Yellow Oriole" notices. I said I hadn't found him. He said I was disobedient and inefficient, so he ordered the district guards to tie me up and take me to the Zhenwu Temple in Fan [unclear] for detention. Later, my uncle Shen Xingyuan and the heads of Yufu Township, Shen Maonian, and Manyang Township, Wu Yucheng, negotiated with him and settled the matter with 50 yuan. When he was released, District Chief Wu opened a court session and had me sign a statement. According to Shen Xingyuan, Wu Yucheng, Shen Maonian, and the witness Chen Shuchun, when we went to Fan [unclear] to negotiate with District Chief, the district chief wanted 100 yuan to release Dejiu. Later, Xu Tinggui, the uncle of the district chief, mediated and reduced it to 50 yuan, which was handed over to the district chief at the counter of Xu Tinggui's shop. According to the defendant Wu Kai, Shen Dejiu was in collusion with the bandit Chen Xuemeng, who was wanted in Xinghua County, so I ordered the district guards to arrest him and send him to Fan [unclear], intending to send him to the county government from Fan [unclear]. Later, Zhang Qixin, a police officer from the Fan [unclear] Public Security Bureau, mediated and told me to release him first and give him 20 days to hand over Chen Xuemeng. As for them saying that the money was handed over to me at my uncle Xu Tinggui's house, that was not the case. I only spent one night alone at my uncle's house that night, and they did not go there. According to the witness Xu Tinggui, no money was handed over at my house, and I don't know any of the plaintiffs. Wu Kai did not come to my house that day either. According to Chen Xuemeng, I am 59 years old, a farmer from the Seventh District. I am really a good citizen. I have relatives with Wu Kai. He falsely accused me of being wanted in Xinghua County. I request the court to send a document to Xinghua County to investigate. If there is a case in which I am wanted, I am willing to be shot. I have no enmity with him. Why did he pull me in when he was sued by others? I don't know any of the people in the plaintiff's group, and I have never been to Yufu Village in my life. After the interrogation, the judge ordered both parties and witnesses to sign a statement. Wu Kai and Chen Xuemeng were released on bail with reliable commercial guarantors pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Resolutions of the County Construction Committee: The Jiaxing County Construction Committee convened an important meeting of various committee members the day before yesterday, and the following resolutions were made: (1) To prepare a budget for the collection and expenditure of public welfare donations from residents along both sides of Xinma Road, and to formulate collection methods, as ordered. It was resolved that official agencies such as the Fire Brigade should also donate funds for public welfare, and that the County Party Department, County Government, County Court, etc., which are all located on Xinma Road in front of the county, should also be subject to the same collection in order to promote it. The remaining residents and shops should be sorted separately to ensure that the burden is evenly distributed and not biased. (2) To establish a memorial tower for the seven martyrs, the names of those who have not yet returned the previously issued donation booklets should be verified, and the booklet numbers should be handed over to members Lu and Wu to collect them.

<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from Lu ChengZhang and Wang Shushen in Pudong</h3>
<p>Regarding the item in the Suzhou Communications column of the local news section of your newspaper on September 18th, titled (Investigation of the Two Hui Collusion and False Accusation Case). The case of Wu Hansheng, the owner of the Hengmian Tongsheng Paper Shop, being a reactionary, was reported by Shao Kangjun, the principal of the Minyi Elementary School near our town, to the local Fourth District Second Branch on August 11th, claiming that he was suspected of being a reactionary. The Fourth District Second Branch immediately forwarded the request to the Public Security Bureau for strict attention. The Public Security Bureau believed that he was indeed suspicious and ordered a chief police officer to go to the store at 8 p.m. on the 12th to search for and find reactionary publications, which were sent to the county and then to the High Court for handling. This is completely inconsistent with what was stated in your newspaper (Luchang Zhang and Wang Shushen, etc., from the Hengmian Town Tongsheng Paper Mill in Nanhui County, owed the store several tens of yuan for paper materials. The store owner Wu Hansheng asked Lu Wang and others to collect them, and Lu and others claimed that they had misrecorded the accounts, causing a conflict). It should be corrected. Lu Cheng Zhang and Wang Shushen, September 19, 19</p>

<h3>Jinan University Emphasizes Moral Education</h3>

<h3>Junyi Middle School Plans to Build New School Buildings</h3>
<p>Junyi Middle School, founded by Wu Kaixian, an executive committee member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, and others, has been keen to manage its internal facilities and administration since Shen Gongzhan became the principal last semester. In the joint examinations organized by the Municipal Bureau of Education, the school's performance surpassed previous results. As a result, the school became overcrowded in the following semester. This was partly due to the inadequacy of the school's buildings, but also partly due to the strict discipline of the school. It is reported that the school, recognizing that many applicants for admission this semester were turned away, has found it necessary to actively prepare to build its own school buildings. Preparations are currently underway, and it is expected that the school will have a new look by this time next year.</p>

<h3>Various Schools Exempt Shaanxi Students from Tuition and Fees</h3>
<p>The Shaanxi Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, due to the severe disaster situation in their home province, felt that the students studying outside were greatly affected, and their daily lives were also difficult. Last month, they organized a petition delegation to go to the capital to petition the Ministry of Education, requesting that the Ministry order various schools to exempt tuition fees to maintain their studies. This was previously reported. It is now known that the various schools have received orders from the Ministry to exempt this year's tuition and miscellaneous fees. After receiving the order, the various schools have also tried their best to show compassion. The current Law and Politics, Guanghua, and Minzhong schools have exempted tuition fees and a small number of miscellaneous fees. Law, Fudan, Chizhi, and Zhonggong schools have completely exempted tuition fees. Daxia, the Academy of Fine Arts, Dongya, the Physical Education Academy, and other schools need to have their school affairs meetings resolve the matter. It is heard that these schools have always been committed to nurturing talent, and with the severity of the Shaanxi disaster, there should be no problem with exempting tuition fees.</p>
<h3>Japanese Bridge Requests Educational Funding</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Public Works Cannot Agree in Practice</p>
<p>The Education Society said that the Japanese expatriates in this city are striving to develop Japanese expatriate education. Previously, the union of various roads jointly submitted a petition to the Bureau of Public Works, requesting that it provide subsidies to the schools and education enterprises established by the Japanese to promote development. It is now heard that the Bureau of Public Works has frequently expressed sympathy in principle, but it is not easy to do so in practice. Because if the Bureau of Public Works grants the Japanese expatriates' request and subsidizes Japanese expatriate education, the Chinese, who account for the majority of the population and taxpayers in the concession, will inevitably rise up and demand that the Bureau of Public Works will have no way to cope. Therefore, although the Bureau of Public Works is sympathetic to the Japanese expatriates' request to develop education, it is actually very difficult to provide subsidies.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Expedition Football Team is Scheduled to Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Due to Procedural Errors, the Expedition Was Suspended</p>
<p>Expected to Arrive Here on the 29th</p>
<p>The Chinese expedition football team's ambition to conquer Europe and America with their strong players is commendable. However, due to procedural errors, the expedition was unfortunately suspended, and the team is now planning to return to Shanghai. Before leaving the country, the expedition team should have submitted their amateur status certificates to the Chinese National Sports Advancement Association, and then the association should have consulted with the South China and other sports associations to invite strong players, so that the team would have strong strength and legitimate status. Other problems could also be easily solved. However, this was not done, resulting in the British side inquiring about the matter with various sports associations in Shanghai and Hong Kong without receiving a satisfactory reply. As a result, the British side refused the team's entry. The Chinese expedition football team's grand plan has become a pie in the sky. Yesterday, someone received a telegram from a player on the team, saying that the team will leave Singapore in a few days and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 29th of this month.</p>

The previous senior champion, Mr. Lindsay Hua, did not participate in this year's competition, which inevitably reduces the excitement. However, the Japanese player Mr. Hyosu is a former Japanese Davis Cup player and has excellent skills, enough to compete with Qiu Feihai. Shi Guiya is a rising star, but it is unfortunate that he will meet Qiu Feihai in the first round. Qiu Feihai is expected to be the most promising winner of this year's championship. There are many talented players in the junior group. The previous runner-up, Mr. Wyatt, continues to participate and has a good chance of winning the championship. The young Chinese star Zheng Zhaojia has just recovered from his leg injury and is expected to perform well and show his talent. The schedule for the first week is listed below:</p>

<h3>All-Japan Middle School Sports</h3>

<h3>Two Organizations Echo Liao Zhang Qiaodian</h3>
<p>Promote Peace and Complete Unification</p>
<p>Urge Yan and Feng to Relieve Military Power</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegram The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued two important telegrams on the current situation, which are recorded as follows: (1) To Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, National Government Chairman Chiang, Shenyang Commander Chen, all Headquarters, all Commands, all Military Divisions, all Brigades - We have read Commander Zhang's clever telegram advocating for an immediate ceasefire to alleviate the people's suffering. All follow-up matters will be under the Central Government's direction, etc. The benevolent words benefit all. Peace is precious, as the ancients said. Since the military campaign began, the people have been displaced and the soldiers have died in the fields. All these sacrifices are our people. The Central Government's campaign to quell the rebellion was not originally intended. If all parties have regrets, the Central Government must be benevolent. It is hoped that after Commander Zhang's clever telegram is issued, the Northwest and Jin-Ji generals will repent their past mistakes and work together for peace. They should immediately send a telegram expressing their sincerity. All measures and methods will await the Central Government's decision. Rescuing this turbulent situation and maintaining unification is of utmost importance. We must rely on the people's will to achieve good governance. We await orders.

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sincerely hopes that abundant harvests will bring prosperity, and that ending the war will bring peace to the people.

The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Union.</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Song Continued Meetings Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reportedly Planning a System-Wide Tax Consolidation Issue</p>
<p>The Meeting May Not Conclude in One or Two Days</p>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen convened a meeting at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance the day before yesterday to discuss important financial matters. According to financial sources, the meeting continued yesterday and may not conclude in one or two days. Minister Song personally attended. Participants included Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration, Jia Shiyi, Director of the Taxation Department, and Li Kihong, the current Special Commissioner of Finance for Hubei, who is in charge of tax consolidation. Since being summoned to Shanghai by the Minister, Mr. Li has been going to the Tax Consolidation Committee of the Central Bank every morning. It is rumored that the series of meetings are systematically planning the national tax consolidation issue. Because the National Government previously ordered the tax consolidation to be completed before Double Ten Day, they cannot postpone the deadline unless absolutely necessary. Therefore, they are actively preparing. It was previously rumored that after Li Kihong was transferred to the position of Special Commissioner of Finance for Hubei, Jia Shiyi would take over the Tax Consolidation Committee. It is now known that Mr. Li will still be in charge, drawing on his expertise.</p>
<h3>The Case of Recovering Concession Telephones Is Transferred to the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Communications for Planning</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications Replied to the Chinese Users' Association Telegram</p>
<p>The Chinese Users' Association of the Shanghai China and Foreign Telephone Company received a clever telegram from the Ministry of Communications yesterday stating that the Ministry has learned of the Association's presentation on September 10, in which the Association pledged to defend the recovery of concession telephones to the end, demonstrating its support for national rights and respect for laws. The Shanghai Public Concession Bureau has already signed a franchise agreement with the newly organized Shanghai Telephone Company. The Ministry believes that the clauses contained in the agreement all infringe on rights and violate the contract. The Ministry has submitted a detailed description of the negotiations, listing the points where the contract is not in compliance, and has requested that the Executive Yuan review the matter and determine the method. The Executive Yuan then resolved at its 83rd meeting to hand over the matter to the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Communications for joint consultation. The Secretariat transferred the letter to the Ministry, and the Ministry sent personnel to consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs many times. The government decided to proceed from a practical perspective, first recovering the telephone assets of the former China and Foreign Company in Pudong, South Market, Zhabei, and other Chinese areas. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate the issue of police power in road construction beyond the boundaries. Once resolved, the Ministry will take over the telephone assets in those areas. As for the telephones in the concession, other appropriate methods will be developed to continue negotiations. This plan has been jointly submitted by the Ministry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Executive Yuan for approval and gradual implementation. The Ministry has ordered the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to estimate the materials needed to convert the users in the Chinese areas of Pudong, etc., so as to purchase and distribute materials and commence construction to take over as soon as possible. The Association is a Chinese users' organization, and it is hoped that the Association will inform the users of the above plan and assist in its implementation. In addition, if there are other effective methods that the users themselves can implement, it is hoped that everyone will work together.</p>
<h3>The Water Price Increase Case</h3>
<p>News from the Bureau of Public Works</p>
<p>Expresses the Need to Maintain the Original Proposal Yesterday's newspaper reported that Mr. MacNaghten, Chairman of the Bureau of Public Works, replied to the Real Estate Association regarding the water price increase, saying that the Bureau of Public Works will reconsider the matter soon. The reporter of this newspaper visited the Bureau of Public Works yesterday. According to the authorities, the proposal to increase the water price by 40% due to the impact of the gold standard on silver prices was originally passed by the Bureau of Public Works. Although the opposition from all sectors is rampant, the Bureau of Public Works is well aware of the difficulties of the water company, so it has decided to allow it to increase the price. The Bureau of Public Works' current attitude is to maintain the original proposal, and the price increase will be implemented starting this month.</p>
<p>Letter Requesting Inspection of Net Profit Numbers The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association and the Shanghai Real Estate Association both received letters from the Shanghai Waterworks Company yesterday, stating that (we respectfully request your association to select members and organize a delegation to inspect the net profit numbers on which this company's proposed increase in water surcharges is based) (the Ratepayers' Association) (the Real Estate Association) has also been invited separately in another letter. For the convenience of inspection, we would like to request your delegation to visit our company's office and inform us in advance of the names of the representatives and the date and time of the inspection.

<h3>Foreign Shipping Companies in Shanghai Adopt an Austerity Policy</h3>
<p>Dull Business, Layoffs</p>
<p>Chinese Employees Laid Off, Unemployed</p>
<p>The shipping industry this year has been the most sluggish due to the turbulent situation. Suspensions of operations and layoffs are becoming increasingly common. The unfavorable phenomena in the foreign shipping industry are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Dara The American Dara Shipping Company is a king in the Pacific shipping industry, with 17 giant ships in operation. This year, due to excessive competition with British and Japanese shipping companies, business has been dull. Recently, ships weighing 10,000 tons often import and export only 300 to 500 tons of cargo. Mr. Dara, the owner of the company, is scheduled to come to China on October 3 for inspection. To reduce expenses, a layoff was held yesterday in the Shanghai office.</p>
<p>Five people belonging to the ship's head office have been laid off, and 20 people have been laid off at the Balianjing Wharf. The previous practice of two people managing one warehouse has now been changed to one person managing two warehouses. Twenty-five Chinese people lost their jobs and livelihoods in one day. Each of those laid off was paid three months' salary.</p>
<p>Dalian The Shanghai branch of the Dalian Steamship Company has received a telegram from the head office stating that due to poor business in various locations, austerity measures must be implemented. It has been agreed that a total of 100 employees will be laid off from the branches in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Japan. The president of the Shanghai branch has discretionarily decided to lay off five Chinese employees, and two Chinese employees have also been laid off at the Huangpu Wharf. Only one Japanese employee has been laid off.</p>
<p>NYK After nine new ships were built this year by the Japan Mail Steamship Company, the business was not good, resulting in 140,000 tons of empty ships being docked. The Chinese sailors on each ship were dismissed and sent back to Shanghai and Hong Kong. It is now proposed to reduce the number of land-based office personnel. It is heard that the Shanghai branch plans to lay off ten Chinese employees. The president of the branch has gone to Japan for consultation, and there is also news that the Chinese employees of the wharf police station will be laid off. The implementation will be announced after the president returns to Shanghai. The Osaka Shosen Kaisha has also proposed layoffs.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow Is the Memorial Day of Zhu Zhixin's Martyrdom</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters Will Hold a Memorial Meeting</p>
<p>All Sectors Must Send Representatives to Participate</p>
<p>Tomorrow (the 20th) is the tenth anniversary of the martyrdom of our party's martyr Zhu Zhixin. The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters has specifically scheduled a memorial meeting to be held at the Republican Theater on Minquan Road in the South City at 9:00 AM. All levels of party headquarters, organizations, and groups in the city must send four representatives to participate. The five districts of Pudong, Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhenru, and Meilong are far from the city and will hold memorial meetings nearby.</p>
<h3>Public Security Organs Must Not Handle Opium Cases Arbitrarily</h3>
<p>Notice from the County Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued a notice yesterday, stating that the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs had instructed the Opium Prohibition Committee to investigate. Since the promulgation of the new opium prohibition law, the penalties for opium offenders have become more severe. As a result, opium offenders often prefer to bribe the public security organs to settle the case rather than being transferred to the court after being arrested. Although investigators have found no conclusive evidence, the opium offenders are afraid of further offenses and remain silent, and the public security personnel are even more reluctant to disclose the illegality. This situation will not only hinder the opium prohibition efforts but also give the public security organs an opportunity to accumulate wealth. Therefore, it is proposed that in the future, if people intentionally offer bribes to escape the law, once the investigation confirms the facts, the bribe-givers and bribe-takers will be punished according to the law, and the bribes will be recovered and confiscated. If anyone misunderstands the provisions of the opium prohibition law, mistakenly believes that the penalty is for a minor offense, and does not intentionally offer a bribe, they may not be punished according to the law if they truthfully state the facts to the authorities and provide supporting evidence. If people come forward to report bribery and the investigation confirms the facts, the bribe-givers and bribe-takers will be punished according to the law, and the bribes will be recovered and a portion of the recovered bribes will be awarded to the informants in accordance with the regulations for rewarding opium prohibition fines, so as to prevent abuses and emphasize opium prohibition. The committee discussed and resolved to adopt the above proposal, and the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Judicial Administration have successively replied with their approval and suggestions. In addition to notifying the relevant parties separately, we hereby request you to investigate and instruct your subordinates to comply with and publicize the matter. It is hereby ordered that the director of the department instruct the county bureaus to comply with and implement the order strictly and issue a public notice. If public security personnel handle opium cases arbitrarily again, they will be subject to dismissal and punishment according to the law, without any leniency. This is the order. In addition to distributing this notice, we hereby order the county magistrate to instruct the director of the Public Security Bureau to comply and issue a public notice to inform the public and conduct inspections at all times without any leniency. This is the order. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to comply, we hereby issue a public notice to inform the people of the county. This is the notice.</p>

<h3>Silk Factories Urge Suspension of Public Weight Inspection</h3>
<p>The decline of the silk market in this port has reached its extreme. In addition, the spun silk is piled up in foreign warehouses and is difficult to sell. Since April 1st, the Silk Inspection Bureau has adopted public weight measurement for export factory silk, and the manufacturers have suffered losses. They appealed to the trade association to find a way to provide relief. Therefore, the Shanghai Silk Factory Association convened a temporary general meeting of all manufacturers at 4 pm the day before yesterday (18th). More than 90 people attended, chaired by Shen Huachen. At the meeting, the representatives respectively expressed the losses suffered by the export factory silk since the implementation of the public weight inspection. According to past facts, it is estimated that the annual cost of each factory is more than 10,000 yuan or at least 1,000 yuan. The silk industry is in a critical situation, how can it withstand this heavy burden? Moreover, the public weight inspection is only implemented in Japan among the silk-producing countries. Its situation is completely different from that of Chinese silk. The reason why Japan implements public weight measurement is that silk is spun with new-style silk reeling machines and spun by sinking reeling method, and then undergoes re-reeling (commonly known as Yang Fan). Cocoons are cooked thoroughly with cocoon cooking machines and drawn with warm water. Not only do they not use water heaters to dry, but also take water again after re-reeling, so the moisture content is relatively heavy. At that time, the export merchants stationed in Japan suffered a lot of losses because Japanese silk contained too much moisture, so they proposed public weight trading to show fairness, and the government of Japan knew that if Japanese silk was not corrected for moisture, it might not be able to stand in the American market in the silk-selling country, so it agreed to the public weight system to maintain the original position of international trade with the United States and then expand it. This is the fact that Japan implements public weight in the sale and purchase of raw silk to the United States. The reeling method of our country's raw silk exports has always been boiled water floating reeling, that is, the Italian-style mechanical reeling method. Not only is boiling water used for reeling, but also there is a close water heater to promote drying when the silk is sent to the silk box. The silk is moved to the silk room and has a larger water heater to make it completely dry, so except for the climate, it is not as moist as Japanese silk. The two are completely different, and it is obvious that Chinese silk is not suitable for public weight. Moreover, in the past 60 years of China's raw silk trade with foreign countries, European and American buyers have never had any disputes with Chinese silk due to moisture content. Now the trial implementation of this public weight has been nearly six months. The advantages and disadvantages are obvious. If the public weight system is not abolished by the end of this month, the factories will have to close down and wait to avoid being sacrificed in vain. The public is extremely angry, so the committee of the trade association agreed to print the records and send a letter to the Inspection Bureau to explain the unsuitability of the trial implementation of public weight in order to comply with public opinion and stop it as scheduled before October 1 to avoid accidents. The meeting adjourned at 7 pm.</p>
<h3>County Consolidation Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>Forty-Eighth Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Consolidation Committee held its 48th committee meeting yesterday afternoon. Chairman Wang Liping performed the formalities and reported on the following items: Discussion items: (1) The Provincial Organization Department sent a letter requesting correction of the case where the first, second, and third district branches of the fifth district jointly requested the county party headquarters to revoke the order to suspend activities. It was decided to severely reprimand the district branch and prohibit it from making such requests in the future. (2) The Provincial Consolidation Committee issued a notice that in places where wounded soldiers and prisoners are accommodated, if there are more than 50 people, the local party headquarters should send personnel to lecture on party principles to inspire them and instruct the subordinate organizations to comply. It was decided to comply. (3) How to deal with the case where Jin Yongxin, the former secretary of the office, had unclear accounts in August and owed public funds, which had been repeatedly recovered but not yet cleared? It was decided to give him two days to come to the meeting to clear the accounts, and if he failed to do so, the Public Security Bureau would be asked to arrest him. The meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Executive Committee Meeting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Third Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce held its third standing meeting of the executive committee at 4 p.m. yesterday. Committee members Wang Xiaolai, Ye Huijun, Wang Yansong, Gu Xinyi, Yuan Ludeng, Lao Jingxiu, Chen Songyuan, Lu Qisheng, Cheng Xiechun, Xu Qilu, Wu Zhihao, Li Jiaobo, Lu Wenshao and other twenty people attended. Chairman Wang Xiaolai performed the formalities. After the secretary reported on the chamber's affairs, the following cases were discussed: (1) Discussing the consolidation of various public bonds of the former chamber of commerce. It was found that the public bonds issued by the former chambers of commerce were directly raised by the chamber of commerce itself and should be treated differently from other debts. The consolidation should be carried out as soon as possible and the method of repayment and the independent management of the fund should be determined to maintain the chamber's credibility. The total debt of the General Chamber of Commerce's construction bonds is more than 138,000 taels of silver, and more than 15,800 taels of silver is mortgaged. The total debt of the County Chamber of Commerce's construction bonds is more than 60,500 taels of silver. The total debt of the three is more than 230,000 taels of silver. If a method is not determined quickly, the interest on the debt will increase and the burden will become heavier. A comprehensive plan should be made to determine a concrete main case based on 30% of the annual membership fees and the income from rent so that it can be fundamentally consolidated and implemented. (Resolution) To organize an examination committee, Xu Jiluo, Gu Xinyi, Pei Yunqing and others were elected as the committee together with the original proposer to conduct a detailed examination. (2) Discussing the urging of stores that have not yet formed trade associations to prepare for establishment. It was found that Article 2 of the revised implementation rules of the Trade Association Law stipulates that if there are more than seven companies in the same region, they must organize an association in accordance with this law so that they can unify business operations. The association should officially announce and set a deadline for them to prepare for establishment and conduct investigations to list and prepare for reference as a basis for urging. (Resolution) Passed. (3) Discussing the standardization of the names of important employees of companies and stores. It was found that the affairs of commercial companies and stores currently represented by shop owners are very complicated in this city. Their names include general manager, assistant manager, manager, deputy manager, chief manager, and deputy manager. The varieties are different. They generally choose one of the titles they have always used arbitrarily and do not have a certain standard. Outsiders who have dealings with the company may suddenly hear this name, and it is almost impossible to distinguish whether they can represent the company for all rights and limits. It was found that the titles of general manager and assistant manager of commercial companies were stipulated in the company regulations of the previous Qing Dynasty, and there is no basis for them today, so it is difficult to apply them again. The titles of chief manager and deputy manager are only used by companies organized by Cantonese merchants. There is no other basis for them, and the names are not popular. Moreover, the commercial laws and regulations promulgated recently, such as the company registration regulations and the implementation rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law, all refer to the person in charge of the affairs of the company or store as the manager. It seems that the name of manager has a legal basis and is more common and popular in commercial habits. In order to determine the responsibilities and make it easier for the general public to understand, it is said that this name must be standardized. It is proposed that all important employees of commercial companies and stores who are currently called general manager, chief manager, or other similar names should be uniformly changed to manager. Those who are called assistant manager, deputy manager, deputy chief manager, or other similar names should be uniformly changed to deputy manager. Those who are managers serving in the head office or head store should be changed to general manager to distinguish them. If the resolution is passed, it is proposed to submit it to the Bureau of Social Affairs for approval and announcement. (Resolution) Submit to the Bureau of Social Affairs. (4) Discussing the draft rules for the Chamber of Commerce to accept events. (Resolution) Revised and passed. These rules will be implemented temporarily for one year. (5) Discussing the Chamber of Commerce's announcement of the current situation. (Resolution) Passed and sent immediately.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Meeting of the Municipal People's Federation</h3>
<p>Resolved to Telegraph Yan and Feng to Resign</p>
<p>The Municipal People's Federation held a plenary meeting of the committee at 4 p.m. yesterday. Nineteen committee members attended. After performing the formalities, the secretary reported on eight official letters, including the instructions of the Municipal Party Headquarters, the case of rental disputes, the case of insurance, and the case of the price increase of tap water. It was decided to hand them over to the special committees of each group for handling. Next, the cases were discussed: (1) The case of organizing district branches. The secretary reported that citizens in Nanjing Road and Broadway Road have jointly initiated the organization and submitted it for registration. It was decided that there are still doubts about the district branch organization law, and the association should submit it to the Municipal Party Headquarters for clarification before organizing it according to law. Two committee members were recommended to represent the Municipal Party Headquarters to request that the documents of Nanjing Road and Broadway Road be temporarily suspended for registration and reserved for further discussion. (2) The New Sassoon Foreign Firm refused to accept the warning letter from the Association. It was decided to translate it into English and send it again. (3) Temporary motion: Chen Tingfu proposed that the Association send a letter to the Bureau of Works, urging the five Chinese directors to solve the disputes between Chinese citizens in the city as soon as possible, strive to regain rights, reduce the suffering of Chinese citizens, and do their best to engage in construction projects. The motion to benefit the public interests of Chinese citizens within the border was passed and handed over to the secretariat to draft and urge immediately. Next, Lu Qisheng proposed that Vice Commander-in-Chief Zhang telegraphed in favor of peace. The association should telegraph and also telegraph Yan and Feng to resign. It was decided to pass it and hand it over to the secretariat to draft and send it. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Seventh National Anti-Drug Week Preparation News</h3>
<p>Preparations are Being Made Everywhere</p>
<p>The seventh National Anti-Drug Week is scheduled to be held from October 1st to 7th. The Party and government organs and organizations of all provinces, cities, and counties have sent letters from the Anti-Drug Association of the Republic of China to prepare in advance and send the notice of this Anti-Drug Week to various organs and organizations. The local anti-drug branches and anti-drug propaganda associations have also been notified by the association to contact local enthusiastic organizations to prepare for the event. The details have been reported in the previous newspaper. It is said that since receiving the notice of Anti-Drug Week, various places have already started preparations. Provinces such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Xiliao, Ningjiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian have sent letters and telegrams to contact them. Other provinces will definitely report soon. The association sees that overseas Chinese have paid considerable attention to the domestic opium problem in recent years. This year, Huang Jiahuai, the executive director of the association, once promoted the organization of anti-drug branches in the Chinese communities of Nanyang. The association has promoted this Anti-Drug Week overseas. There are many kinds of propaganda products for this Anti-Drug Week, including slides, pictures, slogans, special issues, books, and exhibits. Each category is divided into dozens to dozens of species. In order to facilitate the needs of various places, the association has divided all propaganda materials into Category A for 100 yuan, Category B for 50 yuan, Category C for 20 yuan, Category D for 10 yuan, and Category E for 5 yuan. The number of places that have placed orders is very large, and the Nanyang region is the most enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Petition for Relief from Various Counties in Western Liaoning</h3>
<p>The Jisheng Society and He Fenglin, Zhang Jixin Communicate Via Telegram: The Chinese Jisheng Society recently received telegrams from members of the Liaoning Society, He Fenglin and Zhang Jixin, addressed to Wang Yiting and others of the Chinese Jisheng Society. The telegrams stated: "The counties along the west of our province are located in the lower reaches of various rivers. Since July 3rd, heavy rains have fallen continuously, causing mountain floods. In just a few days, more than ten counties in the western region have become a watery expanse. The most severely affected are Suizhong, Jin County, Panshan, and Xinmin. Jixin, on official business, passed through Yuguan and witnessed the devastation firsthand. It is estimated that the area covered by the floods along the Beining Railway is six to seven hundred li long and two to three hundred li wide, a vast expanse of water. Over ten thousand people have drowned, hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland have been submerged, and countless houses have been washed away. Although officials and gentry of this province have cooperated in planning urgent relief efforts and have set up porridge kitchens in various counties, the disaster area is too large and the disaster situation is too severe. At present, there are no fewer than several hundred thousand disaster victims awaiting relief, without clothing or food, a truly unbearable sight. Urgent relief is currently underway, but autumn, winter, and spring relief will follow in succession. Where the water has receded, sand and silt have been deposited to a height of one or two zhang, making cultivation impossible for two to three years. Relief efforts cannot be delayed even for a moment. Over the years, our society's righteous porridge and benevolent grains have reached nearly the entire country. We will certainly be deeply concerned about the disaster situation in the Northeast this time. We are making a life-saving appeal on behalf of our elders and brothers, seeking assistance. We also know that our society has been providing relief to the provinces of Henan and Shaanxi for years, and our resources are becoming depleted. However, Shanghai has abundant goodwill and numerous charitable organizations. A single call will elicit a response from all quarters. We respectfully request that you, elders, unite various charitable organizations to cooperate in appealing for donations to continuously provide relief and save these dying disaster victims. The people of Liaoning Province will be eternally grateful. Our society's benevolent influence is widespread, and we are especially grateful for your extraordinary assistance. Because of our official duties, we are unable to come in person. We respectfully recommend Mr. Shan Zhongfan as our representative to discuss and handle matters nearby. In addition to separate telegrams from various senior officials of our province, we hereby submit this telegram to report the situation." Regarding the urgent relief and winter relief for the Liaoning Province flood, the society has entrusted Mr. She Guisheng, the director of relief efforts in Tianjin, to handle the matter at his discretion. In response to the telegram mentioned above, a reply was immediately sent stating: "To Mr. Zhang Shuzhun, Chief of the General Affairs Department of the Northeastern Political Affairs Committee in Fengtian, and forwarded to Mr. He Maoru, and addressed to Chairman Wang and Mr. Xiao: We have received your telegram and are fully aware of the situation. We previously received a telegram from Mr. She Guisheng, the director of relief efforts in Tianjin, reporting the severity of the disaster in Liaoning Province. Our society has entrusted Mr. She Guisheng to handle the matter at his discretion. As you mentioned in your telegram, our society has been stretched thin due to the widespread disasters in the provinces of Shaanxi, Henan, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. We have exhausted all our resources, and telegrams and letters requesting relief are pouring in like snowflakes, leaving us at a loss as to how to cope. However, given the severity of the disaster in your region, our colleagues will do everything possible to provide winter relief, which will still be handled by Mr. She Guisheng. As for your request for Chairman Wang, Huang, and Xu to contact charitable organizations and appeal for donations, we will discuss the matter and do our best to assist. We hereby reply to your telegram. We hope you will take this into consideration." Disasters are widespread, and the disaster areas are expanding daily. Relief efforts are difficult to provide comprehensively. Where can we find thousands of spacious mansions and hundreds of zhang of fur coats to help these orphans and prevent them from filling ditches?</p>
<h3>Revival Movement of Domestic Films</h3>
<p>Domestic films were once a sensation several years ago. Since the opening of American talkies in various cinemas in this city, they were initially very prosperous. However, audiences dwindled daily because talkies mostly focused on singing and dancing, and the plots were often far-fetched. Moreover, language barriers greatly reduced audience interest. Luo Mingyou, a famous movie star in North China, was aware of this and recently united domestic celebrities and colleagues to organize the China Film Industry Company. It is reported that the Great China, Lily, and Minxin Film Companies in this city have all joined. It is also reported that Mrs. Zhang Yu Fengzhi from the Northeast and Sir He Dong from the South are both directors of the company. If the company determines its purpose and strives to arrange and produce diligently in the future, the revival of domestic films can be realized, and it will not be a problem to compete with foreign films.</p>

<h3>Liu Tongyun, Manager of Fu Ji Paper Store, Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Just Entered Car to Return Home</p>
<p>Bandits Jumped Aboard</p>
<p>Driver Expelled and Injured</p>
<p>Extortion Letter Received Beforehand</p>
<p>At 8:10 last night, a kidnapping occurred suddenly at the Chun Geng Lane entrance of Da Gou Bridge across from the Big Ben patrol station on Eduya Road, Public Concession. The kidnapped victim was Liu Tongyun, manager of Fu Ji Foreign Paper Store at No. 45 Chun Geng Lane. At the time, the bandits fired six or seven shots as a warning, fortunately without injuring anyone. The car driver was expelled midway and sustained a serious head injury. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Borrowing a Car as Transport: Liu Tongyun, 54 years old, from Ningbo, is currently the manager of Fu Ji Foreign Paper Store at No. 45 Chun Geng Lane, Shandong Road entrance of Eduya Road. The store was established more than ten years ago, and although the business is thriving, it is merely a broker for the Fuji Paper Manufacturing Company, a Japanese company. The commissions earned are also very small. However, Liu's natural diligence has won the trust of the Japanese. Recently, the Fuji Company temporarily lent him a car to use as transportation because of his exceptional hard work. The car is a sedan, license number 6233 (City 2216).</p>
<p>Sudden Gunshots: Liu's residence is located at No. 434 Pu Bai Road in the French Concession. Yesterday afternoon, Liu went out from his home, first to the Fuji Company at No. 14 Guangdong Road, and then to Chun Geng Lane. At 8:10 in the evening, Liu was accompanied by three or five friends from Fu Ji, intending to return to his residence by car. Just as he entered the car and nodded goodbye to his friends, the car driver, Yang Afu (44 years old, from Tongzhou), was about to start the engine when suddenly a gunshot was heard near the back door of the Big Ben patrol station across the road.</p>
<p>Driver Unable to Resist: At the sound of the gunshot, five bandits suddenly rushed out from the roadside, each holding a handgun, and jumped into the car. One bandit pointed a gun at the car driver's mouth, forbidding him to make a sound. Three bandits held Liu in the center, forcing him to drive. The car driver initially attempted to resist, but fearing a repeat of the Fan Dongshan incident on the Jin Shenfu Road the other day, he started the engine and drove west. At this time, another five or six gunshots were fired suddenly, all into the sky, so no one was injured. It is assumed that bandits were lying in ambush on all four sides nearby, fearing that the neighboring patrol stations would be alerted, in order to temporarily resist arrest.</p>
<p>Friends Stood Like Wooden Chickens: At that time, the friends who were seeing Liu off all stood at the entrance of the alley, standing like wooden chickens, watching the car drive west. The two guards at the Chun Geng Lane entrance also cowered and retreated into the alley to avoid stray bullets. When the car reached the Shi Yu Lane entrance of Zhengjia Wood Bridge, one bandit expelled the car driver, Yang Afu, who sustained a serious head injury. The car continued to drive west. Afu was seen by the patrol officer at that location, who, after inquiring about the details, immediately took him to the Big Ben patrol station to report. The patrol chief immediately ordered detectives to drive and pursue the bandit car, but it had already disappeared without a trace. The car driver was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by the detectives.</p>
<p>Received Extortion Letter: After the incident, the Central Patrol Station heard the news and immediately sent Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. According to a staff member of the store, they had received an extortion letter from the bandits two months ago, demanding a large sum of money. The wording in the letter was extremely aggressive, but Mr. Liu did not report it to the patrol station, and over time, he forgot about it. It was truly unexpected that he would be kidnapped now. The patrol station is conducting a thorough investigation, but the car has not been found as of this morning.</p>
<h3>Seventeen-Year-Old Girl Narrowly Escapes Execution in Bandit Den</h3>
<p>Wang Xiangyi Redeems Her for Thirty Yuan</p>
<p>Girl Overjoyed and Willing to Offer Herself</p>
<p>Neighbor Finds Her But She Is Unwilling to Go Home</p>
<p>Wang's Appearance is Strange and Evil, Seemingly Non-Human</p>
<p>Beautiful Girl: Wu Wenlong, a 17-year-old girl from Tongzhou, is beautiful in appearance. Her family has lived near Jinsha Town outside the East Gate of her hometown. Her parents are both alive, and the family's financial situation is considered to be fairly well-off. In recent years, bandits have infested the area north of the Yangtze River, committing murder, arson, kidnapping, and extortion. Any resident with slight savings is targeted by these individuals, either for robbery or kidnapping. Wu Wenlong's family had long been coveted by the bandits. After learning that Wenlong was betrothed to someone but had not yet married, her father cherished her like the apple of his eye. First, they sent a threatening letter to Wu Wenlong's father, Ronglian, but he ignored it. The bandits then resorted to a final measure: on the dark night of April 11th of the old calendar year, they went to Wu's house and knocked on the door. Ronglian, unaware, opened the door to greet them. The bandits rushed in and abducted Wenlong from her bed. Before leaving, they ordered her father to prepare money for ransom.</p>
<p>Prepared for Execution: After Wenlong was abducted, her father thought that the kidnapping of people by bandits in the countryside was commonplace. If he prepared a ransom immediately, the bandits would consider her a valuable asset and demand a huge sum. It would be better to ignore them temporarily so that the bandits would think they had no ability to redeem her and might release her. Therefore, Ronglian ignored the bandits' repeated letters urging him to pay the ransom. Wenlong, with her delicate beauty, fell into the bandit's lair and was inevitably ravaged by the bandits. After a month, the bandits, seeing that the girl's father had not yet come to negotiate, took Wenlong out on May 12th, intending to tear up the ticket and shoot her.</p>
<p>Redeemed for Her Life: Wang Xiangyi, 26 years old, also from Tongzhou, at that time led Wenlong out from under the bandits' guns, hid her in his home, and told her that he could not bear to see an innocent girl die by gunshot, so he spent 30 yuan to redeem her. He asked her where she wanted to go in the future. Wenlong, hearing this, considered him a great benefactor, was extremely grateful and tearful, and voluntarily offered herself to him. The two lived together for several days, then moved to Shanghai, living near Pingliang Road in Yangshupu. Wang made a living by pulling a rickshaw, but the cost of living in Shanghai was high, and his income was barely enough to make ends meet. They managed to survive for two months before running out of money. They then decided to return to their hometown.</p>
<p>Came to Shanghai to Search: Wenlong's father, Ronglian, learned that his beloved daughter had escaped from the bandit's lair and had been taken to Shanghai by someone. He entrusted his neighbor, Ji Xiaomapi, to come to Shanghai to search for her. After arriving in Shanghai, Ji rented a place to live on Xizang Road in the Public Concession and also made a living by pulling a rickshaw. During his free time, he searched for Wenlong's whereabouts, but the city was vast and the population was dense, and he never found any trace of her. He had no choice but to return to his hometown and report back. Wang also took Wenlong and left Shanghai to return to their hometown. He secretly sold some of the family property, and his finances were slightly improved. So, he arranged everything and came to Shanghai again to make a living.</p>
<p>Met on a Boat: The other day, the man and woman took the Baohua steamer from their hometown port to Shanghai. Initially, they did not know that Ji Xiaomapi was still entrusted by the girl's father to search for Wenlong in Shanghai for the second time. As fate would have it, he actually came to Shanghai on the same boat with Wenlong and Wang. They recognized each other on the boat, and Ji urged Wenlong to quickly return home to avoid her family's expectations. Unexpectedly, Wenlong had been with Wang for a long time and changed her mind. She immediately expressed her willingness to live with Wang and that the matter of returning home would have to wait for another day. Ji, hearing this, did not argue with her. Yesterday morning at 2:00 a.m., the boat arrived in Shanghai. Wang and Wenlong hired a sampan to cross the river, and Ji also hired a boat to follow them. Ji immediately reported to the patrol police at the Muddy Beach Ferry, and Wang and the girl were taken to the Third District.</p>
<p>Sent to Court for Trial: Zhang District Chief interrogated the three people. Ji claimed that he was entrusted by his neighbor, Wu Ronglian, to come to Shanghai twice to search for his daughter. Now that his goal has been achieved, he requests permission to take Wenlong back to her hometown. Wenlong stated that after being abducted from her home by the bandits, she initially lived in the countryside, moving east and west, and there was no fixed address. Sometimes they moved several times a day to avoid the eyes and ears of the authorities. The bandits all had ferocious faces and looked extremely terrifying. When these individuals held secret meetings, they hid me in a secret room, and my freedom was completely restricted. I was at their mercy, and if I resisted even slightly, I feared for my life. On May 12th, the bandits suddenly wanted to shoot me. I saw no hope of survival, but unexpectedly, a savior suddenly appeared. Wang Xiangyi spent 30 yuan to redeem me and save me from death. Wang is my savior, so I am willing to be at his disposal. Although my family is extremely expectant, there will eventually be a day of reunion, but I will not go back for the time being.</p>
<p>Seemingly Not a Good Person: Wang Xiangyi's account of how he spent money to save Wenlong was largely the same as Wenlong's account. The District Chief considered Wang's appearance to be strange and evil, seemingly non-human, and it was difficult to believe whether he had spent 30 yuan to redeem Wenlong. It might be a cover-up. It was also possible that he was familiar with the bandits, so not only was he guilty of hiding a girl under the age of 20, but he was also suspected of being involved in reactionary activities. He ordered that all the people be sent to the Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Under Family Pressure, a Young Man Attempts to Drown Himself in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Spitting Blood...Quitting His Job</p>
<p>Mother...No Food to Eat</p>
<p>Extremely Angry...Jumps into the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Fortunately...Rescued</p>
<p>At 9:30 yesterday morning, Yu Rongzhai's son, Deng'ao, 18 years old, a handsome young man residing at No. 99 Nanshi Nanqu Street, boarded the Dongjiadu ferry. When the boat reached the middle of the river, he suddenly took out a card from his pocket, on which was written his address and house number in detail, and placed it on the bow of the boat. He then attempted to jump into the river. Fortunately, a passenger on the boat saw his strange behavior and grabbed him, preventing him from falling into the river. When asked about the reason, he said that he had initially studied at the Black Moon Printing Ink Company, but because he was weak and sickly and the company's duties were extremely tedious, he contracted hemoptysis. He had no choice but to resign and return home to recuperate, but unexpectedly, his mother was unreasonable and often beat and scolded him. He was responsible for all the chores in the house, even washing clothes, cooking, and washing dishes. His mother was often dissatisfied. Because he currently had no job, he had to endure it and remain calm. However, yesterday morning, he was cleaning up in his room when his mother cursed him again and said that he would not be allowed to eat at home from now on. He thought to himself that he had resigned because he was sick, but his mother was forcing him like this, which was really meaningless. He had a small conflict with his mother and angrily left the house. But the world was vast and he had nowhere to go, and he unconsciously had a thought of seeking death, and so on. The boatman, Mr. Li, comforted him with kind words and escorted him back to his home, instructing his mother not to abuse him again in the future.</p>

<h3>Inside the New New Hotel, Obscene Films Screened and Busted</h3>
<p>While the Second Reel Was Playing</p>
<p>Detectives Suddenly Rushed In</p>
<p>Arrested Lin and Wang</p>
<p>Each Released on 500 Yuan Bail</p>
<p>Film is now the most popular entertainment, but films that corrupt social morals are rarely shown in major cinemas. However, recently, general hotels often rent out obscene films that are too terrible to look at for guests' temporary viewing. Screening them late at night in the room may relieve the loneliness of the guest's residence, but it is no different from encouraging prostitution. The Public Works Bureau has decided to strictly prohibit such films and has ordered the Chief Inspector to take charge of the matter. Detective Zhang Shaoqi of the Bureau discovered that a guest in Room 37 of the New New Hotel on Guizhou Road had ordered the hotel to rent out the obscene film. The tea boy demanded a rental fee of 50 yuan to screen six reels, later reduced to 45 yuan. On the night before last, the tea boy led local residents Lin Bingsheng and Wang Changsheng to carry the film equipment, etc., to the room. While the second reel was playing, Chinese and foreign detectives suddenly rushed into the room and took Lin and Wang, along with the items, to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Special District Local Court, and the police station prosecuted them for violating social morals. The defendant hired lawyer Ye Fukan for defense. After questioning by Judge Luo, the defendants were ordered to pay 500 yuan each for bail, and the hearing was adjourned.</p>
<h3>In the Hundred Thousand Yuan Robbery Case, Two Robbers Once Kidnapped in Longjing</h3>
<p>Two Robbers Approved for Transfer to Hangzhou for Trial</p>
<p>Wang E and Wang Yang, two robbers involved in the massive robbery case at the Zhejiang Provincial Bank, were also involved in a kidnapping case in Zhejiang Province. Huan Guanlin, the detective chief of the Jiaxing County Government, came to Shanghai to request their transfer. The Special District Local Court had instructed that the county government prepare an official document for the transfer, as previously reported. It is now learned that the Jiaxing County Government has not yet sent a formal document to the court, but the Zhejiang Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau has sent a detective chief to Shanghai to handle the case and requested the transfer from the police station. A wealthy household, Li, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits in Longjing, not far from Hangzhou, in April of this year. Subsequently, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau successively arrested more than ten suspects, but the hostage's whereabouts were still unknown. After Wang and Wang were arrested by the police station, they confessed to the Li case. Therefore, the Provincial Public Security Bureau came to request their transfer to investigate the hostage's whereabouts from the two robbers, and to have them identify whether the more than ten suspects arrested were all accomplices, to avoid implicating innocent people. The police station authorities, as the court had already approved Jiaxing's request for transfer for investigation with a two-week limit, and Hangzhou also wanted to transfer them but dared not act without authorization. Therefore, yesterday morning, Wang and Wang were transferred to the Special Court again. After questioning by Judge Zhou, it was clarified that Hangzhou wanted to transfer them for the Longjing kidnapping case. Wang and Wang also confessed to kidnapping in Longjing. Therefore, it was ordered that Wang E and Wang Yang be handed over to the detectives to be taken away, with a one-week limit. They must be returned after the expiration.</p>

After Zhou died of illness two years ago, Zhou Yu returned to her parents' home and became acquainted with Qian Xingsheng, a local resident. However, Qian did not engage in proper work and was a vagrant, unable to make a living. Later, Zhou Yu's father, Ba Ahua, remarried her to Zhang Shengrong. After Zhou Yu married into the Zhang family, she still longed for Qian Xingsheng, but she could not get in contact with him to renew their old relationship. Qian Xingsheng was extremely resentful and pretended to be a relative of Zhou Yu's and visited Zhou Yu, and conspired this deadly scheme with her. Zhang Shengrong was stabbed in the throat with a knife, and the wound penetrated from the back of his neck. He was killed instantly. Qian Xingsheng, seeing that his goal had been achieved, abandoned the knife and fled. Zhou Yu was taken into custody by the third branch of the Luodian Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, she was sent to the Baoshan County Government, and County Government Examiner Huang went to inspect and fill out the death certificate, ordering the father of the deceased, Zhang Dongsheng, to prepare a coffin for burial.

<p>A scene at Weile Garden, a proper autumn chill in the air for an outdoor competition. Though it seems a little late in the season, there are still a few weeks left to sit comfortably and watch the race without being bothered by the wind and dew. The ladies and gentlemen of Shanghai should take advantage of this opportunity, as the amazing performances at Weile Garden are unprecedented in Shanghai and have already earned a good reputation. At the beginning of the season, only ordinary bicycle and motorcycle-paced races were planned. However, when a team of motorcycle experts arrived in Shanghai, they encountered rain, and the dirt track could not be used as desired. They then considered building another track. Once the wooden track at Weile Garden was completed, they immediately held three trial performances, and the audience was amazed and praised it endlessly. The motorcycle races are now at a minimum speed of fifty miles per hour and can easily be increased to sixty or seventy miles per hour. The tracks are only supported by a few uprights, and the rest are almost level with the ground at a 45 degree angle, as if to break the law of gravity. Is this not a spectacle to behold? Not only is the audience shocked and amazed, but even the racers, known as daredevils, are extremely excited. After the guests left on Thursday night, they were still racing to get better results. Ordinary amateur athletes, having seen what the experts can do, are also practicing diligently in the hopes of showing off their skills. As for the ordinary bicycle racers, their results are also excellent. Whether it is a long or short distance race, the speed is extremely fast. However, only a few people have gained a good reputation so far, with the Annam team being the most prominent. Others still need to learn racing techniques and how to win unexpectedly. The Annam team, under the guidance of the French, has more experience and has benefited greatly. However, there are also Chinese teams that can compete with them and go head-to-head. The consultants only point out what needs to be done. At the meeting held on Thursday night, it was announced that the next social race would be held on Saturday (tonight) starting at 9:00 PM. There will be three motorcycle races, as well as amateur races between the McLins team and the Russian team.

At 11:30 AM, military police fully armed suddenly arrived on the ship, declaring they were there to arrest Liu Fu Lai, creating a very serious situation. However, Liu Fu Lai had already disembarked at that time. After an unsuccessful search, they tied up cargo supervisor Wang Shou Kang and held him hostage. Subsequently, they accompanied soldiers to Liu Fu Lai's home to search, but found no evidence. They then detained Liu's wife at the Public Security Bureau and Wang at the military headquarters, stating that they would not release him until Liu Fu Lai was apprehended. Following this, eleven cargo handlers from the ship appealed to the Wenzhou branch for assistance. Thanks to the efforts of Committee Members Lin and Yang, and Director He of the China Merchants branch office, they were able to secure Wang's release on bail at the regiment headquarters, but with the condition that if Liu Fu Lai did not appear within a month, Wang would still be summoned for questioning. The reason for Wang's detention and the crime Liu Fu Lai was accused of were not verified, and the authorities did not clearly state the charges at the time, which is baffling and alarming. We are submitting this urgent letter to your newspaper for clarification and assurance. We remain grateful. Respectfully submitted to the esteemed editor of the Shen Bao newspaper, and best wishes for your well-being. Shanghai Branch of the General Association of the Seamen's Industrial Union of China, September 19th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: Regarding the report in your newspaper this morning that the Second Anniversary Garden Party of this association will be attended by 700 people, whereas in truth it will only host a few dozen attendees made up of our own members and specialized committee members, these are not facts. We fear misunderstandings may easily arise. We hope you can immediately issue a correction. Respectfully submitted to the local news editing department of the Shen Bao newspaper, the Diplomatic Discussion Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, September 19th.</p>

<h3>Snippets of News from the North</h3>
<p>— Yu Yang Zhou</p>
<p>A certain gentleman, a relief worker from the Ji Sheng Association, has returned from Shaanxi and Henan and described what he saw and heard, enough to satisfy the desire of the people of Jiangsu to know the truth about that area.</p>
<p>The frequent famines and starvation in Shaanxi and Henan are well-known to people in the South. According to this gentleman, although the area is occupied by Feng Yuxiang's troops, who have established officials and governments, it is essentially a lawless world. Feng's army relies on the land to support hundreds of thousands of starving soldiers, and the amount of requisitioning is extreme. To protect themselves, most of the people in the area have joined the Red Spear Society. Their power is so great that it is frightening. No commoner, nor even a formal military unit of less than a battalion, dares to travel openly, or they will have their weapons confiscated by the Red Spears. Even in areas where the army is stationed, the troops remain in the city, with the gates closed, while the area outside the city is entirely under the control of the Red Spear Society. There is a clear dividing line, and neither side crosses it. If there is an alarm outside the city, the troops inside the city will say, "Our troops are stationed inside the city, and the area outside the city is not our responsibility," and ignore it. In reality, if the city gates are opened, even the defensive perimeter of the city cannot be guaranteed. The Red Spear Society is mostly composed of starving people, so they are very careful to protect relief workers. One day, this gentleman encountered a villager on the road who looked emaciated, with a sallow complexion and ragged clothes. He was carrying a basket, and the gentleman did not pay much attention. Suddenly, he felt the man grab his arm. When he looked back, the tattered clothes in the basket had been lifted, revealing a box of ammunition. The gentleman realized that he was being kidnapped. He said to the man, "I am a relief worker here to save the starving people. Instead of being thanked, I am being detained. How can you be so heartless?" The man immediately apologized and released him. Later, he saw a young man in Western clothes being robbed by several people. He inquired and learned that he was a member of Feng's military headquarters and was being held for ransom. The gentleman was very surprised, but the locals thought it was a normal occurrence and nothing to be alarmed about. It was later learned that a large sum of money was used to redeem him. This was truly a strange affair.</p>
<p>The gentleman also said that after several months of war, wounded soldiers were everywhere in the South, but he had never seen any in the North, nor were there any military hospitals. He was surprised by this, and when he asked the locals, he learned that wounded soldiers in the North, regardless of the extent of their injuries, were simply abandoned to their fate. The reason was that there were so many disaster victims in the area that it was easy to recruit soldiers. Moreover, there were no talented people or medical supplies, so there was no need to provide medical care. The gentleman was shocked to hear this. He also heard that Northerners often considered Southerners to be weak and often used them as servants, and they always had the idea that Northerners should rule the South. Therefore, they concealed news of defeats and did not allow people to see wounded soldiers, in order to project an image of strength. The gentleman was speechless.</p>
<h3>The Inventor of 606</h3>
<p>— Tian De</p>
<p>The discovery of the syphilis spirochete was made in 1905 by Hofmann and Schaudinn. The discovery of 606 was made in 1907 by Ehrlich. These are all masters of German medicine. Thanks to the efforts of the entire country of Germany in in-depth natural science research over the past hundred years, such outstanding philosophers have been cultivated, achieving such groundbreaking and forward-looking feats. I would like to describe the report by Ehrlich, the inventor of 606, on the successful experiment of 606 at the German Medical and Pharmaceutical Congress in Kahnberg, Germany in 1910. Although the event has passed and become history, the joy and excitement of the time still seems to be present today. Writing about it can inspire future generations to be excited.</p>
<p>Ehrlich said: "606 is the latest invention, and it is generally recognized that it can fundamentally cure syphilis. There are several reasons for this. First, 606 can search for and destroy syphilis spirochetes in the blood cells, eliminating them completely. Second, 606 can stimulate the body's own syphilis-fighting antibodies, enabling the body to eliminate syphilis on its own. This is most evident when treating infantile syphilis. For infants with congenital syphilis who cannot be injected, injecting their mother or wet nurse with 606 is sufficient to transmit the immunity generated in the adult's body to the child through breast milk, achieving a cure. In addition, 606 has another, most difficult-to-explain function. As reported by a professor earlier, a syphilis patient suffered from severe syphilitic ulcers on the upper jaw, causing extreme pain to the point that they could not eat solid food. Therefore, at 2:00 PM, they were injected with 606. By 7:00 PM that day (five hours later), the pain had completely disappeared, and they were able to eat sausage and bread without stopping. The person was overjoyed and hugged the doctor, expressing their gratitude and calling 606 a 'miracle drug.' The reason for such rapid effects is most difficult to explain, so it is impossible not to call it a miracle drug. Other examples include the complete disappearance of systemic secondary syphilis rashes three days after injection with 606, and the self-healing of throat pain or tongue itching in syphilis patients a few hours or even an hour after injection with 606. Even more gratifying news is that 606 is not only an effective drug for treating syphilis, but also for treating diseases other than syphilis, such as relapsing fever, malaria, and yaws. "When he finished speaking, the applause was like a thunderclap. Since then, the name of 606 has spread around the world, especially the new 606 (registered name: Neosalvarsan), which was obtained by Ehrlich after painstakingly researching and experimenting for the 914th time from the derivatives of 606. The injection procedure is even simpler, and the effect is even more rapid. This is truly one of the most exciting pages in the history of medical evolution." (End of Essay)</p>
<h3>A Record of Being Deceived into Divorce</h3>
<p>— Chen Bo Ying</p>
<p>Zhou Dehou, from Songjiang, Suzhou, married Liu Zhiyun, also from the same village. Liu had studied at a primary school and was quite capable of keeping track of household affairs and writing short notes. Initially, the couple got along very well. After a while, Zhou became acquainted with a woman named Li, and their love grew strong, and they discussed marriage. However, Zhou was cunning. He remained intimate with Liu, even more so than before. Liu's relatives told her what they had heard, but Liu dismissed it as nonsense. One day, Zhou said to Liu, "My dear, although the love between us is steadfast, something has changed. There is a woman in the west of the city who is infatuated with me, but I have rejected her. Now she is seriously ill, and if she could get a letter from you, she might recover. Just let her read it once and then burn it. Heaven is above, and it will see everything. Will you agree to this?" Liu asked what she should write in the letter. Zhou said, "You can write that we are considering divorce because we have disagreements." Liu wrote the letter as requested. Zhou left and did not return for three days. Liu became suspicious, and then a lawyer's letter arrived, stating that since the couple had already divorced, they were free to marry whoever they wanted. Liu fainted upon receiving the letter. When she woke up, she cried bitterly, realizing that all the love in the world was false and that men's hearts are easily changed. However, it was too late for regrets. Liu had a son named Zhou Sui. Zhou said to Liu, "This little baby belongs to me to raise. I cannot let anyone else take care of him." Zhou also said that it was inconvenient for him to breastfeed, so he allowed Liu to raise him. After separating from Zhou, Liu's family's financial situation became difficult. She made a living by sewing and washing clothes for others. When her son grew up a little, she sent him to school. The son studied diligently and always ranked first in his class. He went from primary school to middle school, and from middle school to university. After graduating from university, he became a teacher and lived with his mother. At this time, Zhou Dehou and the woman Li had also divorced. Zhou had some thoughts of getting back together with Liu. He summoned his son and told him, "I feel very guilty about what happened years ago. Now I want to reconcile. I hope you can gently persuade your mother not to disappoint me. Since you have already graduated from university, you should study abroad. If you return with a doctorate, you will be more respected by society. If things go well, I can pay for your studies abroad." The son said, "Since I was young, I have only known my mother, not my father. This matter should be decided by my mother. But if you try to lure me with studying abroad, do you think I would be swayed by a doctorate? Stop dreaming." The son returned and told his mother everything. Neither of them wanted to reconcile with Dehou. Zhou could only sigh deeply.</p>

<h3>Travel Notes from Southeast Asia (52)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>On the 30th, Abbot Shiling, who had recently bought a car, invited me to visit Qingyun Rock to see the Snake Temple, about twenty miles south of Penang. The temple is dedicated to the Qingshui Grand Master. When we arrived, there were many Western and Chinese visitors. I asked where the snakes were, and he pointed to the altar and said, "Haven't you seen them?" I looked up and saw five-colored, mottled objects that looked like flower branches. Those near my body were all flower snakes. Some coiled around the flower branches offered to Buddha, intertwined with the flowers. Others coiled around mirrors on the high places, resembling flower borders. The trays and Buddha boxes were filled with snakes, like grapes, with about three to five, or even seven to eight, intertwined in a ball. If you lifted them with your hand, they would raise their heads. When you let go, they would coil back down. The colors were bright and vibrant, mostly green and flowered. There could be seventy to eighty, or even a hundred, snakes in a room, each one to two feet long. Near the altar, they seemed to be addicted to the smell of incense smoke and didn't want to move. It is said that the snakes come and go on their own, without bothering humans. They have never bitten anyone, just like domesticated animals. People also place chicken eggs for them to eat. I found this very strange, thinking that snakes could also cooperate with humans. Is it really like the old saying, "The wolf and the lamb shall feed together?" It is recorded that a Zen master named Song (whose name I have forgotten) lived in the mountains, and a high-ranking official visited him (also forgetting his name). The official asked if the master had any attendants. The master called out, "Da Kong, Xiao Kong!" Two tigers appeared. The guest was terrified, but the master comforted him, and the tigers retreated. It is indeed true that "high virtue tames dragons and tigers." To the east of the temple was a square pond where a large snake, over ten feet long, was kept and fed chickens. Another monk told me that tens of miles away, in Ipoh, there was a cave with a large snake that could be two miles long. I did not believe it. Another monk said that Snake Mountain in the South Sea also had many snakes that did not harm people, just like the snakes in this temple. It is also said that many people who go to Siam (Thailand) see snakes. The king believes in Buddhism, so people do not harm snakes, and snakes do not harm people. Could this really be true? I will visit Siam soon to investigate.</p>
<p>From the Snake Temple, we went to Penang Hill. The hill was named because the British used it to signal to ships. The mountain is very high, and there is a railway to the top, similar to the Peak Tram in Hong Kong, but the engineering is more solid. There is a waterfall flowing from the top. You have to change cars once in the middle to reach the top. It costs one dollar for a round trip. There is a tea shop at the top and books for sale. There are many red leaves, which look like flowers. Looking closely, you can see that they are actually leaves that have changed color. There are only yellow flowers and green leaves, and the red ones are leaves, not flowers. Standing on the high mountain, you can see that Penang Island is only a small spot. Looking out, you can see the mountains emerging from the clouds, and the clouds merging into the sea. The scenery is excellent. The Kek Lok Si Pagoda can also be seen in the distance. There are Western-style houses on the mountain that can be rented to escape the heat. There is a hotel where each night costs nine dollars. Workers work on the railway on both sides, earning eight jiao to one dollar a day. We visited the machine room, where one or two people turn a large flywheel. The railway is a very large project, and it is quite impressive.</p>
<p>Penang has magnificent mountains and rivers, and the climate is pleasant, making it suitable for health. There are many large trees, so it is very cool outside the bustling city.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Children's Dental Problems</h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Health Bureau began inspecting the teeth of students in various primary schools in January of this year. According to the reports from dentists, as of June 24th, a total of 5,664 students were examined, and the total number of cavities was 30,110. Only 185 teeth were completely healthy. From this, it can be seen that the number of dental problems accounts for as much as 97%! This is terrible! Humans rely on teeth to chew food. If the teeth are not healthy, chewing will be impaired, leading to indigestion and stomach problems. Humans only get one set of permanent teeth. Girls grow teeth at seven months, lose their milk teeth at seven years, grow their permanent teeth at twenty-one, and lose their teeth at forty-nine. Boys grow teeth at eight months, lose their milk teeth at eight years, grow their permanent teeth at twenty-four, and lose their teeth at sixty-four. If they are not protected during childhood, when the old teeth are being replaced, the old ones will already be decayed, easily trapping food and creating lactic acid. The new ones are like tender shoots that are easily eroded by lactic acid, causing damage. Therefore, damaged teeth should be extracted to prevent them from harming other teeth. In daily life, it is especially important to pay attention to cleanliness. After each meal, children should be instructed to brush their teeth once to rinse away food residue and avoid the bad habit of picking their teeth. The habit of picking teeth can loosen the gums and widen the gaps between teeth, making it easier for food to get trapped, allowing lactic acid to penetrate deep into the tooth chamber. All kinds of dental problems arise from this. The ability of lactic acid to erode tooth enamel is easily proven. Try soaking an eggshell in vinegar overnight, and it will soften, and the lime layer will peel off layer by layer, until only the egg membrane remains. This is because teeth are mostly made up of lime. The outer layer of enamel protects the lime, just like the enamel on porcelainware protects the iron underneath. If the enamel is damaged, the iron will rust, the same principle applies. Therefore, when brushing teeth, never use coarse, hard toothpaste, as it will damage the enamel. The 19th chapter, section 1 of the second publication of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association of Science Professors and Researchers discusses the use of toothpaste to prevent tooth decay and strengthen the gums. If food residue remains in the gaps between teeth, it can turn into lactic acid and corrode the enamel surface. Therefore, it is necessary to brush teeth with toothpaste every morning and after meals. It also says that the raw materials for making toothpaste must be carefully selected. If it contains excessively coarse powder, the enamel will be damaged. Therefore, the finer the toothpaste, the better. It also says that the best raw material for making toothpaste is magnesium carbonate, because this substance has a pure alkaline nature that can eliminate lactic acid and remove plaque without damaging the enamel. However, this material is very expensive, so calcium carbonate and gypsum powder are often mixed in. From this, it can be seen that it is necessary to choose toothpaste carefully, and making toothpaste for human use is a matter of ethics. If the buyer buys inferior toothpaste and uses it every day, they are destroying their own teeth. Ask yourself, how many times in life can teeth be replaced? If people are careless during childhood and let things take their natural course, irregular teeth will arise, slanting outward, growing horizontally, forming a rake shape, or resembling webbed fingers, all due to the failure to correct them. If brushing teeth is done every morning and before going to bed, it can not only keep the mouth clean but also correct the alignment of the teeth, making them neat. Just like planting tree seedlings, you must support them when they are growing to make them stand straight. In this way, there will be no crooked or bent branches. If you wait until they are grown, you cannot straighten them, even with an ax. Therefore, during the time when children are losing their milk teeth, from the age of seven or eight, their parents, elder siblings, teachers, and guardians should teach them to brush their teeth and develop the habit. The toothbrush should have soft bristles, and the handle should be small and smooth to fit their mouth. If you use hard, coarse brushes, the gums will often be scratched and hurt, and the tender skin of the mouth will be easily damaged. Some rough people like to use hard, coarse toothbrushes and take pleasure in making their gums bleed. This is like the habit of liking scabs and should not be taught. Also, the toothpaste used by children should have less mint and more fruit flavor to appeal to their preferences. Experience shows that most children at the age of seven or eight like banana or lemon flavors, while those from nine to twenty-three like spearmint and fennel flavors. However, sugar is very easy to turn into acid. Try holding any candy in your mouth overnight, and you will definitely have a strange acidic taste in your mouth the next morning. Therefore, sucrose or glucose are not suitable as sugar flavors in toothpaste, and lactose is even worse. Only glycerin should be used, and it should be diluted with a large amount of water so that its taste is appropriately sweet and not too strong. In this way, it will be pleasant and not acidic in the mouth. Diabetics are forbidden to eat sugar, but they are allowed to eat glycerin. This is clear proof. Therefore, I have done in-depth research and feel that there is a need to specially formulate a children's toothpaste that meets the needs of children's dental health. Therefore, I have specialized in manufacturing a children's toothbrush. Its special advantages will be explained in the advertisement, so I will not repeat them here. As for washing products, Wudi brand tooth powder and red mouthwash, as well as the recently improved whitening toothpaste that has a spearmint flavor, are already quite suitable. Now, I have also produced a soft toothpaste with a lemon-banana flavor, packaged in a mirror box so that they can look in the mirror and correct their bad habits while brushing their teeth. This will make protecting their teeth a regular habit and prevent them from stopping and starting inconsistently. Then, according to what is recorded in the old books, women lose their teeth at the age of forty-nine, and men lose their teeth at the age of sixty-four. Before this time of teeth loss, just like trees before late autumn, they should be free from decay. Those who have the responsibility of guiding and managing children should realize that children's dental health is related to their lifelong happiness and should have the same thoughts. They should not regard my words as unimportant.</p>

<h3>The Gold Market's Decline Has Stabilized</h3>
<p>Fluctuations throughout the day reached 9.3 taels - Yesterday, the gold market situation was exceptionally chaotic, rising and falling with extreme volatility. The fluctuations at certain points reached two or three taels, with a total difference of nine taels between the high and low prices. Initially, dealers anticipated a downward trend, but unexpectedly, large players aggressively bought, reversing the market's direction. Eventually, the market trended upward, almost breaking the 40 tael mark. Simultaneously, foreign exchange unexpectedly strengthened, and banks showed strong buying interest, albeit with a widened ask price of half a point, subtly indicating strength rather than weakness. Early trading saw Yi Yu, Cui Tai, and the Dalian Gang actively bidding, while speculators also covered their short positions. Sellers, such as Yi Feng, Yong Yuan Xing, and Yong Zhi Feng, remained unfazed by the slight increase in prices, maintaining their short positions. Later, while buyers were active, hopes for a swift end to the war and a potential rise in silver prices to recover from its depressed state fueled expectations of a gold price decline. As a result, gold prices plummeted rapidly, falling by five to six taels, briefly dipping below 30 taels. However, around noon, the market unexpectedly surged upwards. Various firms resumed buying, causing prices to jump by over seven taels, a phenomenon that was difficult to comprehend. In the afternoon, demand exceeded supply, and prices continued to climb, soaring from around 35 taels to approximately 40 taels. Exchange rates appeared firm. The final price was around 39 taels. - At the opening of trading this morning, prices slightly declined by four fen. The November opening price was 536 taels and 1 qian, a slight decrease of four fen. Meanwhile, silver prices in the UK and the US each increased by one-eighth. With exchange rates unchanged, market sentiment remained weak. Zhi Feng, Yong, and others began selling, causing prices to drop by four taels, reaching 32 taels and 23 qian. Prices then recovered slightly, gaining two taels. Subsequently, upon the announcement of the first market price at 34 taels, followed by a widening ask of 1.25 US dollars, the decline in gold prices was limited to 0.75, reducing the decline to 33 taels and 12 qian. However, banks maintained a strong appetite for UK gold. Sumitomo purchased eight lots of January gold at 31.25, while Huabao Bank engaged in interbank trading for the same number of lots in the following month, boosting prices to 34 taels and 4 qian. Shortly after, sellers appeared to be plentiful, with volumes reaching 1.23 taels at 10:00 AM. Mitsui sold Dalian gold for the following month at 1.21625 taels. Subsequently, prices rebounded, prompting Yi Yu and other firms to continue buying. Additionally, Mitsui absorbed eight lots of November UK gold at 8.25, reaching 3.4 taels by 10:30 AM. The exchange market weakened, and Mitsui only sold Japanese gold for the current month at 1.21625 taels. Yi Da and others sold, causing prices to plummet by three taels, reaching 30 taels at 10:45 AM. However, prices immediately rebounded, with Sumitomo and Huabi trading January US dollars at 41.25 yuan and Datong and HSBC trading December UK gold at 8.3125. Moreover, firms such as Zhi Feng, Yong Cheng Feng, Yong and Yi Yu continued to buy. Large players absorbed the supply, causing prices to rise again, exceeding 7 taels. The price reached 37 taels and 9 qian at noon. The noon closing price was 7 taels and 6 qian. The official first market price was revised to 599 taels and 4 qian, with a widening ask of 0.75 initially, followed by 0.62 and 3 taels, and then 65 taels. The noon closing price was 58 taels.</p>
<p>Evening closing prices rebound by 2.4 taels - The afternoon market opened at 37.5 taels, and then rose from 7.2 qian to 8.7 qian, due to speculative buying. Subsequently, Indian remittances increased, and sellers such as Yong Cheng, Chang Xie Yu, Zhi Feng Yong, and others actively sold, causing prices to fall to 35.12 taels at 2:50 PM. Furthermore, the sale of UK gold from India dampened market sentiment. After 3:00 PM, prices gradually increased as Yi Da, Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Yu, Yuan Da Yong, and others competed to buy. The exchange market also stabilized, causing prices to increase by over 4 taels. At 2:45 PM, prices reached 39.8 taels. Afterwards, prices fluctuated by just over one tael. After 4:00 PM, prices were at 37.89 taels. The closing price at 4:30 PM was 38.9 taels, an increase of 2.4 taels compared to the previous day. The highest price of the day was 39.8 taels, and the lowest price was 30.05 taels, a difference of 9.3 taels. The official price was listed as 578 taels, and then 57 taels. The registered prices were: September, 50 taels; October, 42 taels; November, 38 taels; water compensation 50 taels; afternoon, 51 taels. The early market for goods was 6 taels; noon closing was 8 taels; afternoon closing was 7.6 qian, and the closing price was 8.3 qian. - Demand exceeded supply. The following firms engaged in transactions: Yi Yu, Shun Li, Wan Xing, Bing Xing, Sheng Da, Cui Tai, Tai Kang Run - all bought. Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Da De Cheng, Yi Da - had varying degrees of buying and selling. Yi Feng Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, Tong Tai Chang - all sold. In the afternoon, Yi Yu, Cui Tai, Yuan Da Yong, Cheng Feng Yong, Fu Yu - all bought. Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Yi Da, Yong Cheng Chang - remained in fluctuating buying and selling positions. Xie Yu, Bing Xing, Yuan Cheng Yong, Yi Feng Yong, Heng Xing - all sold, hedging positions, and alternately entered and exited the market. The Dalian Gang bought 1400 to 1500 pounds and sold over 1000. The Guangzhou Gang alternately bought and sold, but in small amounts.</p>
<h3>Wide Disparity Between Official and Unofficial Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed exchange rates for various currencies had already increased by half a point, likely due to continued rises in overseas silver markets, prompting purchases from China. The exchange rates for British and American currencies were slightly firmer. The rates for Japanese and American currencies remained unchanged. The London shilling also increased by 0.025, with the British exchange rate rising by 0.125 to one shilling, seven pence, and seventy-five U.S. cents. Adding 0.025, the calculation is 40 yuan. The Indian rupee increased by 0.075, totaling 111 rupees. The German mark increased by half a yuan, totaling 167 marks. The French franc increased by six yuan, totaling 1018 yuan. The Japanese yen increased by 0.075, totaling 99 shields and 0.25. The Singapore dollar decreased by 0.05 yuan, totaling 141.5 taels. The Japanese gold decreased by 0.075, totaling 1.235 taels. The Hong Kong dollar remained at 81 taels. As for the domestic market, it was initially flat, then weakened, stabilized at noon, and strengthened in the afternoon. The spot gold market weakened, then improved, and finally trended upward. However, people were unsettled due to the sudden changes in the atmosphere, causing prices to fluctuate constantly. Chinese merchants and speculators had previously purchased spot gold, while companies like Zhongfu Chang sold over 100,000 pounds of British gold in the morning. Banks such as Shanghai, Sumitomo, Mitsui, Taiwan, and Dongya absorbed it. In the afternoon, tens of thousands of pounds were traded in and out. Sumitomo and Mitsui in Shanghai also sold and absorbed. Telegrams from India instructed bankers to sell. Furthermore, various banks traded 60,000 to 70,000 pounds among themselves and traded over 100,000 U.S. dollars. Chinese merchants sold a small amount. As for Japanese gold, the Dalian gang and others bought in over 1 million yuan, mostly sold by Mitsui. Sanlin and Korea also sold. However, the market situation remained stable, showing a wide disparity between official and unofficial rates. Comparing the closing prices with the previous day, the shilling decreased by 0.0625, the U.S. dollar decreased by 0.125, and Japanese gold increased by half a point.</p>
<h3>Overseas Silver Markets Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>China Buys… Sellers Raise Prices</p>
<p>According to yesterday's London telegram, the silver market continued to rise due to Chinese purchases. The market was flat. At the closing, there were buyers, but sellers were only willing to sell at an increase of 0.0625.

<p>Market Overview: The market atmosphere has been greatly invigorated in recent days, making the market exceptionally prosperous. Speculators are afraid to try shorting foreign interest rate rates rashly.

<h3>Securities: Bond Price Increases Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for various public bonds still opened for multiple types in the morning, but only the Disbandment Bond saw some transactions in the afternoon, with no other activity. The futures market remained very active, with trading between the morning sessions becoming increasingly lively, reaching 1.2 million yuan. Although it was slightly calmer in the afternoon, it still reached 0.7 million yuan. As for the changes in bond prices, they had already risen significantly in succession in recent days, making selling more active. At the initial opening in the morning, buying interest still dominated, with a significant increase compared to the previous day. Subsequently, competition between buyers and sellers was intense, with prices fluctuating up and down, causing supply and demand to stabilize slightly. Although the fluctuations continued to be moderate in the two afternoon sessions, prices continued to decrease slightly compared to the previous day. As a result, the average of the "Whole Six Finance" and "Nine Six" bonds continued to rise in the futures market, while spot prices for Customs, Disbandment, and Readjustment Bonds rose significantly. The market prices of Disbandment, Readjustment, Customs, and 19th Year Tobacco Bonds fell by about one yuan. The relaxation of market prices is a natural trend after a large increase. The total trading volume for spot goods throughout the day was 26,800 yuan, while the total trading volume for futures reached 19.8 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Optimistic Situation in the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Long Positions Adding... Short Positions Covering... Japanese Yarn Rebounding</p>
<p>Upward... Market Very Tight</p>
<p>The sharp rise in the yarn market and the tight situation are due to optimism about the current situation. Therefore, people's hearts are suddenly strengthened, and the upward trend is fierce. Scattered short sellers are again showing panic, so buyers seize the opportunity to purchase and add to their positions, making the market extremely tight for a time. There is a lack of sellers in the market. In the afternoon, due to exchange rates, third-grade yarn also rose by two or three yuan. There are also large accounts covering their positions, but it is said that British factories are also selling short a lot. The subsequent developments still depend on the actual situation for advance and retreat. The current market situation is chaotic and inconsistent, and the market is fluctuating between ups and downs.</p>
<h3>Human Label (Ren Biao) and Other Marks Rise by More Than Two Taels</h3>
<p>The market opened with positive military news and the expectation that the situation would stabilize. Scattered short sellers flocked in, and there was a lack of sellers. The atmosphere tightened, and prices rose by 1.7-1.8 taels to 2.2-2.3 taels in each month. The market then fell back by 0.3-0.4 taels. In the afternoon, the demand for third-grade yarn increased, and there were still many buyers in the market. Xiesheng (a company name) also heavily squeezed short sellers, but some yarn factories sold short. As a result, prices rose again by 1.8-1.1 taels in each month. The total trading volume for the day was 35,000 bales. Public Tai sold 2,600 bales, Tianlong 2,600 bales, Shenchang 1,350 bales, Yiyu 3,100 bales, Changji 1,200 bales, Xingyuan 850 bales, and Yuantai 950 bales. The remaining amounts were between 300 and 550 bales. Xiesheng bought 3,100 bales, Yuda 2,100 bales, Daji 1,450 bales, Rongxing 2,000 bales, Lichang 2,000 bales, Hanfeng 1,250 bales, and Yiyu 900 bales. The other amounts were between 500 and 650 bales. The closing prices of Human Label (Ren Biao) are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Human Label Price Increase/Decrease and Inventory | Closing Price | Increase/Decrease | Inventory</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>September 1524, Up 2.4 | 16.350 | December 1518, Up 2.1 | 44.550</p>
<p>October 2519, Up 2.6 | 37.700 | January 1522, Up 2.3 | 30.900</p>
<p>November 1519, Up 2.5 | 42.640 | February 1526, Up 2.4 | 15.850</p>
<h3>Spot Sales Active, Price Increases of Two to Three Taels</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales are gradually becoming more active. Statistics show that various groups bought a total of 2,450 bales throughout the day. Those within the same trade group purchased 515 bales. Prices increased by two to three taels. Customers from Luzhou purchased 465 bales, Hankou purchased 100 bales, the interior purchased 365 bales, Shantou purchased 210 bales, Niuzhuang purchased 130 bales, Xuzhou purchased 260 bales, Sichuan purchased 345 bales, Guangdong purchased 90 bales, Qingdao purchased 225 bales, and various groups purchased 90 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Shows Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>The cotton market is calm. The American cotton market is also stable, but with exchange rates loosening, foreign cotton is becoming secretly cheaper. Therefore, Japanese factories have made large-scale orders, and new cotton prices are very low. It is said that in these few days, various Chinese and foreign factories in Shanghai have pre-ordered about 30,000 to 40,000 pieces of Indian and American cotton. Domestic cotton business is relatively scarce, but factories are purchasing to adjust the color and blend of local cotton, though the quantity of bales is very small. Therefore, although the yarn market has suddenly risen due to optimism about the situation, the cotton market is still flat. The Japanese Dongmian and Han groups are still selling in the standard market. However, with recent spot activity, people's hearts are more stable.</p>
<p>Han Biao (Han Label) Continues to Rise by 0.01-0.02 Taels: The Han Biao market opened with a flat situation. Because the yarn market rose, it was pulled up, and prices rose by 0.005-0.015. The market was still flat in the afternoon. Because Indian cotton prices were cheap, there were still few buyers, and prices rose by 0.01 in each month. The total trading volume for the day was 47,100 dan. Ruidi sold 5,000 dan, Hehua 2,100 dan, Public Tai 2,900 dan, Yuanda 2,500 dan, Yiyu 2,400 dan, Yichang 1,600 dan, and Shenchang 2,600 dan. The remaining amounts were between 900 and 1,000 dan. Lichang bought 4,200 dan, Tianchang 2,200 dan, and Hengde 2,500 dan. Other amounts were between 1,000 and 1,100 dan. The closing prices of Han Biao are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Han Biao Closing Price | Increase/Decrease | Inventory | December | 3250 | Up 0.025 | 103.700</p>

<h3>Spot Cotton Mill Demand Active</h3>
<p>The spot cotton business is improving as the yarn market progresses and the mill demand gradually strengthens. The situation is greatly improving. The source at the wharf is 2,910 bales of Yao cotton and 130 bales of Tongzhou cotton. The sales prices are listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Overseas Cotton and Yarn Prices Rise More Than Fall</h3>
<p>American Cotton Situation Slightly Firmer Yesterday, American cotton was firm at first due to purchases by the same trade group, then weakened due to selling in the South, and finally firmed again due to some short sellers covering their positions. The change in futures was recorded at 1 pound. Spot was unchanged. British cotton futures were unchanged. Spot rose by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 20 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 18th):</p>

<h3>Hexia Rice Market Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>New Xian Rice Declines Sharply</p>
<p>Zhabei Yesterday, No. 13 and 14 boats arrived at Hexia. Sales were not very good. Although broken Geng rice was dull, there were still some scattered goods being resisted. Therefore, the situation was stable. The price for West New Geng rice opened at 20 yuan and 8.5 jiao. The price for East New Geng rice was also 20 yuan and 5.6 jiao. Central Guan goods gradually softened slightly. However, the market for New Geng rice will be difficult to maintain if the weather continues to be sunny. The market has already turned, and it would not be surprising if it falls back. New Yangjian rice suddenly declined sharply, falling by 0.5 yuan. It is necessary to top it up specially at 15 yuan. The left-hand side of Guan's new Duzi Xian rice fell by 0.6-0.7 jiao. At noon, the particularly high price only opened at 16 yuan. Over 30 truckloads of new Kejian rice arrived from Yuanda. Although sales were still active, the trend was to shorten it by 0.3-0.4 jiao. The highest topping price was only around 14 yuan. The Jiaobaijian market was also sluggish, with the price勉强开 opening at 17 yuan. At the moment, various new Jian rices have all reported fatigue, and the source is increasingly being transported by merchants who are very eager to sell, which is the opposite of the situation when it was sold at a high price in the past. Therefore, Geng rice will be more affected in the future because the inventory is weak and all parties have great intentions to enter. Therefore, high-priced goods hovered between 19 yuan. However, medium-grade goods are inevitably slightly softer.</p>
<p>South Shanghai The source from Hexia is still not surging. Sales on this street are also flat. The focus of transactions depends entirely on the situation in the Zhabei market. Therefore, the arrival and sales here are both weak. For example, it is impossible to see the receipt of broken Geng rice, and only medium-grade Su Tong goods are available. The market has consistently hovered between 19 yuan and 8-9 jiao. The situation is extremely sluggish. Although the new Geng rice and Xiang rice from the city and countryside of this port have not arrived in large quantities, they can already be seen sporadically. Particularly high prices are 20 yuan, and ordinary prices are between 19.5 and 19 yuan. The overall situation is flat. The New Dujian rice market reported poor performance, with the high-priced goods on this surface only opening at 14 yuan and 3-4 jiao. The new Yangjian rice is only 14 yuan, and the selling is sluggish. The market has a continued weakening trend. The factory's new Jian rice has little rise and fall due to cost considerations. The price opened at 13.5 yuan. There are times when it changes and times when it stops. The market lacks standards. High-priced goods are at the 19-yuan mark.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Amid Peace</h3>
<p>North Sales Hopeful... Market Slightly Rebounds Firm... However, Foreign Atmosphere Still Poor</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices of various months generally showed a hovering state. In the morning, foreign wheat only had a slight drop of 0.1-0.2 jiao. The selling pressure from the short side stopped slightly or even engaged in covering, so the market felt slightly settled amid the weakness. However, the lowest-end distant months had a slight rebound of about 0.01. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was very optimistic about the situation, and the sales in the north may be able to turn around from this point. Therefore, people's hearts were relatively stable in fact, and the distant months also rebounded slightly. However, the subsequent rise and fall will ultimately depend on changes in foreign exchange. If the exchange rate rises daily, the order of foreign wheat will inevitably be cheaper. This is the most noteworthy thing. As a result, this month was unchanged, October was better by 0.01, November was better by 0.0025, December was unmoved, January was better by 0.005, and February was unmoved.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Amid Rising Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Factory Selling Pressure... Subsequent Steps Still Depend on the Weight</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat market opened in the morning, the atmosphere of declining prices in various months remained unabated. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat also slightly dropped, the comparison of exchange rates also gradually increased. According to the pricing of foreign spot wheat, the settlement with 41 yuan of U.S. dollars only totals 4.7 taels of Shanghai yuan. Therefore, inland factories and small and medium-sized factories in this port still consistently put selling pressure, and the quantities were very large. For example, November saw the lowest price of 4 taels and 6 jiao, and December saw 4 taels, 6 jiao, and 0.01. It seemed that domestic wheat was perhaps not worth much because of foreign wheat. Later, because part of the shorts covered, the market turned stable. Until the afternoon, all plates were set with the situation in the north. Powder sales were set and active, so people's hearts turned more stable. As a result, the difference was small. It is estimated that this month was better by 0.01, October was weaker by 0.02, November was weaker by 0.02, and December was weaker by 0.01. January and February were weaker by 0.02. The attitude of each factory in the spot wheat market seemed to turn active. The high-end goods in each grade did not rise or fall. Medium-grade goods were about 0.01-0.02 yuan weaker. It is estimated that 12,000 bags of Yaowan white and red wheat, Niuzhuang wheat, Shan wheat, and white wheat were opened. Fufeng and Fuxin handled 7,000 bags of Niuzhuang wheat.</p>
<p>North and South Goods</p>
<h3>New Quan Pao Longan Second Batch Arrived</h3>
<p>The first batch of the New Quanzhou dried longan opened in the market as scheduled due to the large number and moist condition, but the loss was very high based on the cost. However, it was also unavoidable. It was heard yesterday that the second batch had arrived on the Yuanan ship. The amount was greatly reduced, with only 1,200 boxes, which was less than half of the previous batch. If the condition is dry, there should be hope for a recovery. It was also heard that subsequent batches will temporarily stop shipping to Shanghai to promote a turnaround in the market.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Hangzhou's New Cocoon Trial Reeling Results</h3>
<p>Reeling Loss is High... General Pull Requires 800-900 Catties</p>
<p>The autumn cocoons in Hangzhou this year have suffered from weather damage, resulting in a poor harvest and poor cocoon quality. New cocoon samples from Linping, Yuhang, and other places have been shipped to Shanghai Dingyuan and other factories for trial reeling. The results show that a general pull requires 800-900 catties of dry cocoons to reel one dan of silk.</p>
<h3>Zhenmei Green Tea Sales Slightly Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Lu Zhuang and Tu Zhuang's Zhenmei and Xiumei green teas were started to be handled by Jinlong, Xiehe, Yihuo, Tongfu, and other firms. However, the selling prices were still low. Zhenmei green tea still showed a tendency to increase and then lower prices. Large group teas have become increasingly sluggish in recent days. The current inventory is no less than dozens of groups, making it difficult to sell. Only Yihuo Foreign Firm bought more than 100 boxes of Qimen black tea. The selling price also fell by more than 10 taels.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Market Amid Progress in the Current Situation</h3>
<p>North Group Handling Appetite Improves Suddenly... Over 500 Pieces of Coarse Cloth Transacted</p>
<p>Local Cotton Cloth Yesterday, the market trend turned hard, because the times had developed greatly and peoples hearts were suddenly upheld. The first north was formed into movement. Groups in Tianjin, Niuzhuang, Dalian, and other regions, transacted over 500 pieces of coarse cloth yesterday. The Hubei Tianzi brand rose to eight taels, and sixteen pound double elephants and five old men were also being handled. The searching vigor of small inclined brands from Ningbo and Wenzhou and other regions were rekindled, so they became even more firm. The demand for only fine cloth and coarse cloth was the strongest. Over 100 pieces were received yesterday. White flannel was also purchased daily.</p>
<p>East and West Piece Goods The market situation rose again. The demand from Tianjin groups was very large. The fine serge of East goods rose by 0.025 to 0.05. Huxinting was resold at 0.02675 taels, Hanshan Temple at 0.0265 taels, and Dingfacai at 0.02625 taels. Jian Gongduan rose by 0.025. Feima Tong Queqiao Hui was also sold at 0.02825 taels. Tianjin groups purchased in large quantities. The Han group transported over 200 pieces of Moganshan Jian Gong Ni at 0.03125 taels, Tianci Caiyuan at 6.4 taels, and Four Scholars Jian Gongduan at 0.03 taels. The price of goods seen on this street rose again, and they were added one after another, which was a great difference from the market air of the previous day.</p>

<h3>The Revolution of Love</h3>
<p>— Yang Shaozhi</p>
<p>A Five-Act Play, Written by Hu Chunbing</p>
<p>An era has its own literature, and a nation also has its own literature. When a nation evolves to this era and is inspired by the torrent, it will naturally reveal the material of this nation's literature in this era. [Whether a country's national character is understood is greatly related to its country's literature; whether an era is understood is also related to its era's literature.] This is what Lafcadio Hearn once solemnly said. What is the situation in China now? What kind of consciousness does China need? To put it bluntly, China has long embarked on a period of suffering, and most of the people are saddened by suffering and tend to be decadent and depressed. At present, there is a glimmer of hope, which is the recent discovery of a fierce new force in the literary world, radiating an unusual light in the cloudy and dense sky, marking the banner of saving the Chinese nation from disaster. This is something worthy of our joy and elation.</p>
<p>We know that literature is the torch of the nation. Burning it can stimulate national thought and intensify national emotion. In China in an era of suffering, in the morbid state of the decadent and degenerate Chinese nation, we should naturally shake ourselves up, burn the torch of the nation, stimulate national thought, and intensify national emotion. The literary world has seen the crux of the problem, knowing that the era of wagging our tails, begging, wailing, and weeping has passed. If we want to save China, if we want to save the Chinese nation, the only way is to make ourselves healthy. "The Revolution of Love" is a literary work containing such a mission.</p>
<p>"The Revolution of Love" is a five-act play. It is entirely set against the backdrop of the current era, depicting the rampant reactionary forces during the rise and fall of revolutionary emotions. The idea that the Chinese in the eyes of so-called imperialists cannot even hum a tune is written so delicately and profoundly. But it does not dryly and completely depict this kind of all-out revolutionary drama. It takes this as the central consciousness of the play. In addition to attacking the deceptive and despicable behavior of imperialists, it also attacks the old concepts in the old society, and even more so attacks the old concepts and old forces from the reality of love, leaving them completely scarred and without any room for lingering.</p>
<p>The story in the play takes Zhong Sanmin as the protagonist. Zhong Sanmin is a young man with rich reason and emotion. He is extremely firm and courageous, and his mind is extremely precise and profound. He also has revolutionary emotions. However, his father is a very docile foreign slave, taking the comprador in the foreign firm and the foreign manager as emperors. All the characters in the Zhong family, except for Sanmin, have the same mindset as this head of the family, even his relatives. This can be regarded as the result of so-called "matching social status" in Chinese marriage customs.</p>
<p>There are twenty or thirty characters in the play, but each has a special style and can represent the characteristics of the transition period between the old and new societies. Yun Song and Yun Gui's frivolity and boldness, Lei Ma and Zhu Er's prudence and loyalty, Ai Hua's liveliness, and Fang Zi's unrestrainedness further set off the freedom of the Goddess of Liberty. Liberty everywhere forces out the truth and rushes with bravery and enthusiasm. Such a colorful play is really rare in our country's original plays.</p>
<p>In the plot of the first act, Sanmin is absolutely not tempted by profit and lust, betraying his integrity. He knows that the trend has reached this point, and he can fight a desperate battle with the representatives of imperialism. Seeing that Sanmin, in order to seek the success of the revolution, disregards his father's job and the family's income, he even scolds the foreign manager, Addison, saying, "I know that you capitalists who have been officials and warlords are representatives of imperialism. You must know that if we want freedom, we are not wagging our tails and begging for your favors. We are taking back our due rights from your mistakes. If you hold on to our due rights and refuse to give them to us, then we will recognize that imperialism is always imperialism and can only be overthrown!" Such a brave spirit is naturally worthy of promotion. In the second act, he also passionately shouted, "I deeply feel that to overthrow imperialism and the comprador class, we must engage in national revolution and first overthrow the warlords and bureaucrats, so I resolutely joined the revolutionary army to engage in the most front-line revolutionary work." At the same time, in this play, the despicable behavior of the representatives of imperialism is reflected everywhere, which can naturally complement each other and easily remind people's ideas.</p>
<p>However, this play can also be said to be a record of love, but it is not like general works depicting love, focusing on the decadent kind of tune. Although this play has plots about love in every chapter, it still keeps in mind the main central consciousness everywhere. He demands the permanent victory of love. He feels that "I think if I love freedom, I should break away from my family. If I love freedom, I should eliminate the power of the warlords. If I love freedom, I should overthrow the imperialists. I am continuing to work hard for freedom!"</p>
<p>— (Hua Photography)</p>
<p>There are many more good points about this play. Asking my pen, which is not accustomed to introductions, to introduce it would really bury its original brilliance. Please let the people who study literature appreciate it for themselves. In short, I think this is a play of the era. It is completely set against the backdrop of the current Chinese era and takes a proper consciousness as the center. The only thing we see in China, which is suffering from a shortage of modern plays, is imported goods, which naturally cannot cater to the psychology of Chinese audiences. Especially imported goods cannot ignite the torch of the Chinese nation, stimulate national emotion, and fight for the nation. Therefore, the value of this play lies here, and the value of this book being introduced lies here. We know that this year is the year of drama. The public performances of Shanghai spoken dramas are considered to be numerous, but most of the time, our feelings are disappointment. Among them, only the Xin You's Difficult Drama Movement can barely give the audience a kind of strength, making them believe that they have hope if they are willing to work hard to improve. But I still feel that there is a lack of clear and proper consciousness, and the fundamental problem is naturally because of the lack of plays. Now that we have developed such a play, I hope that people who are enthusiastic about the literary movement will work hard to try it.</p>

<h3>Night</h3>
<p>— Shuying</p>
<p>In the night, no matter how dark it is, there is always a kind of radiance. The radiance of the night is extremely gentle and profound, like a silent friend. He comes and gives you warm friendship in silent opposition. Night not only gives people rest, but also gives you comfort.</p>
<p>When the afterglow of daylight has completely disappeared, your heart does not think about past events, nor does it ponder the future, but simply accommodates all the impressions before your eyes—and who has not had such a situation? Whether you are a busy businessman, an artist, a hard-working worker, an official, or a soldier who has just not heard the roar of gunfire, at this time you are as if you have just woken up in good weather, with the warm and gentle rays of the sun and the sound of birds blending together by your side. Your spirit is fresh and keen, and you seem to feel everything for the first time, but without surprise or special love and hatred, you purely accept them with inner feelings. At this time, you can recognize everything at the bottom of the night.</p>
<p>There is a lamp on the table. This may be an electric lamp, a kerosene lamp, or an oil lamp from ancient times. In any case, it is a kind of small-powered bright thing. No matter how bright the lamp is, let's say you hang a 200-candlepower gas-filled electric light bulb in your room, but the light will never be enough. You always feel that outside the window, his face is tightly贴贴against the glass window, with the eyes of the night闪闪shining with gentle and profound light. Even inside the room, the lamplight is just a stranger who has come to an unfamiliar house. No matter what he thinks in his heart, he will run around, but there are always too many omissions. In the corner of the room, beside the table and chairs, on the sides of all the furniture and utensils, near your hands, nose, and ears, and between your eyelashes, the night quietly waits there. As soon as he can come out, he immediately walks out silently, just like a wife who is too docile, always gently serving you beside you, seeing if there is anything you need her to do. Even the beacon fire when Agamemnon triumphed and the spring lanterns of the Lantern Festival in Lin'an can never drive the night away. He will never leave and will always stay by your side.</p>
<p>Different lights have their own special mood. Electric lights are of course the brightest and most convenient. Electric lights give you a lively and warm mood, stimulate your emotions, and increase your interest, but sometimes they make you feel empty, flat, gray, and dim. Electric lights, such as street lights and lights in the kitchen, evoke extreme loneliness and horror. Gas lights are probably the worst. They stimulate you like a commercial advertisement. If you want to read a book, not for entertainment, nor like a scholar quoting extensively, but to quietly appreciate the meaning of the book, or if you are writing something, not with the intention of becoming a writer, but wanting to sincerely express your feelings, then you should use a kerosene lamp. The kerosene lamp never stimulates your light, but only tightly adheres to the circle of light that surrounds you, just as you need it. Outside are some kind darkness that will soothe your thoughts. The kerosene lamp also scatters lively and light shadows everywhere to accompany you in your meditation. As for when you are talking deeply with good friends and lovers, a candle is the best. Those dancing beautiful flames of candlelight have a rich life. The light and shadow it casts on objects are obviously different from the white-hot electric light. We no longer use candles, our ancient red candles, for anything other than worshiping gods, but I always love those two flickering little flames, smiling at you in a very kind and playful way, just like a pair of eyes that you are familiar with.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about the things about lamplight anymore. Although lamplight is lovely, the essence of night is not here. The infinite temptation of night is also not here. I am not a poet and cannot write out the mystery of night and all his stars, but the things inside are so 觉觉that even a poor collector like me will not be able to get any harvest.</p>
<p>You turn off the lamp and temporarily gaze at the window. If you are not familiar with the night, then your first surprise should be that what flows in from outside the window is not darkness, but a kind of gentle radiance, like a burst of light music, a洞洞箫xiao, a violin, or the singing of young women in a small garden. The lamplight disappears from your eyes, not extinguishing the light, but like falling a layer of curtain from your eyes, replaced by a deeper light. They first walk in lightly, as if afraid of disturbing the host, and then see that they can be received, and immediately walk all over the place with a gentle movement. They are so familiar with all things (because the emotion between the night and all living things is much deeper than that for people) that they immediately blend together. Night is the mother of all things, stroking them, comforting them, adding beautiful colors to them, eliminating all the scars they have suffered in life, and dressing them up to make them very beautiful things. In the gentle radiance of the night, ugliness is gone. The ordinary furniture in your room, the broken table, and the rusted wall are now appearing as pictures. Now they are all living things.</p>
<p>You temporarily gaze at the window. The radiance of the night flows into your eyes and into your heart. This will make you forget everything that happened during the day, whether it is joy or sorrow, and forget those things that urgently缠绕缠绕around you, such as social interaction, business, coping with the operation of daily life, etc. You temporarily think of nothing, making your heart pure white and flawless, capable of accommodating things that are deeper, more basic, and closer to your soul. Then, you will think of many, many emotions that have been deeply imprinted on your soul but have been covered by daily business. You will think of those big and small events that have equal印印</p>
<h3>Autumn</h3>
<p>— (Hua Photography)</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>mark on the heart——a person who has loved with all their heart and soul, a sentence that falls on your heart, a gaze that has made contact with your eyes, or a flower bud with dew that you have secretly visited in the early morning, your heart can't help but throb, just like when you hesitate to say (I love you) to a little girl, or a silhouette that you have accidentally seen on the roadside, a lonely, happy,颓颓唐tang, beautiful silhouette, but later in your imagination, your soul裏裏grows and negotiates and becomes a familiar friend (the characters in dreams and imagination, like those in life, will change, grow, disappear, and die), or the story you wrote when you violently馳驰荡dang and used your blood and life to complete your ideals. These are things that you have long forgotten, but have not forgotten. Who can forget those things that have already made a mark on the soul, no matter how subtle they are? They are just resting in the depths of the heart, waiting for the right situation to reappear. These are led out by the tenderness of the quiet night, writing a smile or loneliness on your face, but whether it is a smile or loneliness, it is beautiful because it is涵涵育yu in the beauty of the night.</p>
<p>But don't always sit at the table, don't always沉沉in deep thought. Go and see the night again, throw yourself into the embrace of the night. First, go to the window, and a陈陈fresh breath will immediately blow on your face. Whether it is the coolness of summer or the cold of winter, it is suitable for you. Even in the cold winter, the night air will never make you uncomfortable. It is a very clear thing, like snowflakes falling on your palm. The cold stimulation can immediately make your spirit excited. You start to look outside, and you see that the colors and contours are melted together, forming a mysterious poetic tremor. Yes, in the radiance of the night, you can feel a kind of tremor, like what you feel on a琴琴弦xian that is emitting beautiful sounds. The shapes you see in the night are all active. They quietly travel, sing, and dance, transforming into infinite beauty, and this is a dark night without the moon, without the stars (you will feel more beauty in the night of the moon and stars). There are very few stars twinkle in the sky, which will move your eyes to raise to the sky, just encountering the light waves of the stars, just like you have encountered the light waves at the bottom of the eyes of a familiar and expectant eye. Dogs are叫叫calling in the distance, peaceful and gentle, crickets are singing a kind of song you have never known before near you, under the window. Light flows out of the distant windows like the radiance of gemstones, flowing coolness in summer and warmth in winter. Those lights are密密talking to you, telling you some light and beautiful words. At this time, ugliness, suffering, embarrassment, jealousy, hatred, and the sins of the world are temporarily eliminated. Your mood is beautiful, as beautiful as the night itself. Human beings are brothers, and human beings and all living things are brothers.</p>
<p>But you won't stay at the window for long. The night entices you to run into his complete embrace, to go to breathe the freshness of the night and throw yourself into the草草plants containing smiles. Then temporarily suspend this short article and wait for me to return to write it again. I believe it will be written better than it is now.</p>
