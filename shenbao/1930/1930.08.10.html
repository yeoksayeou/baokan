<p>工商部前爲救濟金貴銀賤起見擬具便利運輸方案咨請交通鐵道兩部會同辦理兹探錄全文如下</p>
<h3 id="c120">（一）水運之整理 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>（甲）航海航江船隻之整理及添設我國江海航運公司本屬寥寥年來船隻因軍事截留多有損壞政府應先儘量補助俾得整理添設以暢國内之運輸然後徐圖國際航行之準備直輸國産於外洋旣可挽回航權復能促進外輸一舉兼得其利至溥（乙）運河大港之疏浚及溝通水運載重而價廉故歐美諸國雖鐵道如網猶不惜勞費開闢運河以謀國内大川之聯絡我國雖未能言此然直魯蘇浙及湘桂之間運河皆有巳往之成績倘能疏浚溝通則本部三大流域南北數千里貨物可一水通航各國無此天然之利也又沿海各省寫遠貨物出口常不免迂道除原有各港外如蘇之臨洪口崇明港浙之三門灣等均宜設法浚治以便就近出口質言之對於運河大港淤者浚之絶者續之俾脈絡貫通運輸自暢此項工程或實施兵工或就地以工代賑用費無多收效實宏（丙）小輪拖駁之應用用小輪拖駁所以濟帆船之窮仍可借帆輪之用今各大江帆船林立實能裝運大宗物品惟航行迂緩遇風雨則程期尤難預測如提倡小輪拖駁之法必能收事半功倍之效各省内河帆船之裝運求其迅速者似應亦適用此法如能利用内河淺水巡艇尤足收保護之效</p>
<h3 id="c121">（二）陸運之整理 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>（甲）擴充運輸設備邇來商貨阻滯輸出减退原因雖有多端而機車缺乏車輛不敷實爲其中之主要者故主管機關務宜多方設法積極擴充以期根本救濟藉蘇商困（乙）增加行駛次數現在車輛缺乏補充未能完備以致行駛班次過少竊查南滿行車辦法每逾時無幾即有一列之客車貨車開出在我國近况固難語此但一方爲便利商旅而同時復爲鐵路經濟計除擴充運輸設備以應支配外似宜於可能範圍内將車運班次儘力增加至車輛停站時間之久暫爲防抑留情事亦應嚴厲稽核訂立限制專章（丙）嚴禁扣留車輛近年來因戰事關係軍運倥偬扣留車輛原屬一時不得巳之舉方今國事初定建設開始各路客貨列車亟待恢復關於軍運應由主管部嚴密訂定軍運條例飭令軍隊切實遵行不得藉故扣車所有各軍以前扣留之車輛應立即如數發還庶幾路政不致阻梗商貨遂得暢流（丁）採用汽車運輸凡水道不通鐵道未設之處有大宗物産出運須與水道或鐵道聯絡者應築大道利用汽車以供運儎在歐美各國汽車運輸久占有重要之位置且其成本較輕築路之後功效亦廣較之軌道僅能行駛機車尤爲便利也</p>
<h3 id="c122">（三）國内外聯運之改善 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>貨物往往因時間不能銜接屯積中途必多損失故國内貿易重在水陸聯運國外貿易重在國際聯運時間銜接手續簡捷均爲必要條件是宜由關係各部派員會同研究并准商會推定代表與議以期易於實行</p>
<h3 id="c123">（四）嚴禁運費額外之苛索 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>運輸旣有定額額外苛索必徒供中飽商人益受留難之苦苛索者巧立名目如加快費軍事捐護運費等不一而足亟應查明由政府明令一律禁止</p>
<h3 id="c124">（五）特殊品運輸之優待 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>物品之性質不同運輸之標準即異徵費之多寡提倡之先後胥應分别輕重而爲相當規定甲）酌減運費一國貨原料及燃料製造必須原料機械工業必須燃料爲獎進國貨計應分别减等收費以輕成本而示鼓勵二國貨製造品之與舶來品有競爭趨勢者减輕運費俾物價較賤方得暢銷巿塲（乙）提先運輸一有時間性之商品如果品類蛋類家畜類過時或腐或斃故宜提先運輸以便商民二有關民食之米糧爲接濟民食故宜提先運輸以便民食三關於工業應用原料燃料及製造品國貨旣與舶來品競爭於巿塲則其原料燃料及製造品運輸遲早影響亦巨故宜提先運輸以便工業</p>
<h3 id="c125">（六）起駁偷漏之取締 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>各地以運輸爲業者往往廣肆結納或私解包裹或攙和水泥偷漏之事時所不免應由交通主管機關嚴定罰規以資取締</p>
<h3 id="c126">（七）沿途盜匪之防禦 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>頻年兵燹各地盜賊蠭起殺人越貨時有所聞以致商旅裹足不前設法保護亟爲要圖故除大舉清鄉外應由國家就編餘軍隊酌量改組作運輸保安隊之用隨同載貨車船沿途警衛以策安全</p>
<h3 id="c127">（八）轉運堆積之改善 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>貨品起卸轉運暫時堆積勢所必有關於此項堆積之建築設備及其管理均應由交通主管機關詳定規程嚴加取締以杜損失</p>

<p>丨昨日複賽丨卡塔與余劉失敗上海華人公開網球雙打複賽於昨日下午二時半起在中華網球場舉行觀者十分踴躍精神極爲興奮結果林寳華鄭兆佳組與邱飛海江道章組得决賽權結果林鄭組以二比六·六比四·六比四勝卡那凡洛與塔佛爾斯邱江以六比二·七比五·六比三勝余田光劉鏗組兹記詳情於下</p>
<h3 id="c204">（一）林寳華鄭兆佳二丨六六丨四六丨四六丨四卡那凡洛塔佛爾斯 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>林鄭與卡塔於下午二時半開賽林寳華跚跚來遲怱怱登塲頗現慌張之態第一盤無精打彩平平過去卡塔以六比二勝頗見容易自此以後雙方愈戰愈烈競爭形勢十分吃緊與首盤判若霄壤鄭兆佳身手大顯林寳華工夫硬動打得卡塔二人措置爲難疲於奔命結果連勝三盤得最後勝利裁判員徐振東</p>
<h3 id="c205">第一盤…二比六 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>登場交鋒雙方互有疏忽精彩全無惟卡那凡洛穩健如故不稍减色林寳華開球進攻對方還擊得法先勝一局士氣稍振林鄭連遭不測加以失誤頗多又連負四局乃急起直追再上兩局無如惡運臨頭力不從心結果卡那以六比二勝是盤中裁判員亦頗多疏忽之處塔佛爾斯之發球其脚常跳動占得不少便宜幾由裁判員警告後稍改</p>
<h3 id="c206">第二盤…六比四 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>第二盤起形勢轉劇林鄭頗有聯絡　位得當頗能應付裕如惟對方實力未見稍懈第一局勝利仍屬卡塔嗣後塔佛爾斯大施妙　林寳華雖猛力抽擊均被塔氏截回球如砲　一來一往煞是好看林鄭連勝兩局對方亦　一局成二比二之局數旋又至三比三相持並進精彩迭見博及觀者彩聲不少少年英雄鄭兆佳屢試好手與老師林寳華配合得法或用攔殺或用抽擊不多時以五比二占先造成優越局勢而以六比四勝回此盤</p>
<h3 id="c207">第三盤丨六比四 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>是盤中雙方競爭愈烈戒備森嚴痴點極少形勢緊張各有建樹卡塔先聲奪人屢占上風但自二比二後林鄭一躍登先以三比二居勝卡塔不落人後緊隨於後自四比四後輪與林寳華發球連牢四記重如砲彈對方乏力招架遂又以五比四占優一於是聲勢一振至此緊要關頭豈肯放鬆如餓虎撲羊勇猛非凡不數回合又全勝一局乃又以六比四勝第三盤</p>
<h3 id="c208">第四盤…六比四 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>三盤之後略事休息列陣再戰林鄭旣以二比一占優如再加一盤即竟全功而卡塔趨此嚴重時期不得不振作精神背水决戰冀圖挽回危局而達第五盤决賽之目的自開戰以後林鄭奪得第一局後對方以敏銳之攔殺斷林鄭之抽擊竟被連下三局以三比一居勝未幾又成四比二卡塔聲勢凶凶林鄭岌岌可危乃抖擻神威努力奮鬥鄭兆佳發球得勁全勝四記局勢略轉戰劇益見激烈林鄭再接再勵卒再以六比四得勝取得决賽權</p>

<p>邱江與余劉於五時起賽余劉在第一盤中形勢惡劣幾全爲邱江所控制第二盤余劉改變戰略把守網旁應付裕如處置得當觀衆至此精神一振雖終爲邱江屈服然實乃三盤中最有可觀之一盤也第三盤余劉仍有相當之表示乃以邱江緊緊壓迫不能如第二盤之從横自在也故仍遭敗挫邱江乃以三對零得决賽權裁判員胡慮生</p>
<h3 id="c211">第一盤…六比二 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>交戰令下邱江老將軍畢竟不凡一路打去有聲有色余劉神色慌張手法大亂於是開始四局乃在奄然無生氣中被人奪取而去幸而余劉當其本人發球時各爭回一局得以二比六比數失放吾則全軍覆滅矣</p>
<h3 id="c212">第二盤…七比五 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>四卒觀衆鑒於雙方程級相差殊懸興趣大减如入半睡狀態之中乃少英雄余劉及時努力奮發有爲乃改變策略之故立見奇效斯時二人咸身旁網邊隨機欄擊兩老將初本不欲過於苛求以失誘掖後進之原意繼見對方身手矯健亦不無驚異回顧紀錄板上余劉巳以三比零占先嗣後邱江手法一變大局立轉不久反以五比三領導余劉東山再起善用欄網取勝又造成五五相等乃功虧一簣卒爲鄭江以七比五獲勝</p>
<h3 id="c213">第三盤…六比三 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>第三盤空氣緊張形勢嚴重前途燦爛光明之兩青年網球家在進攻程中每占先着而邱江老將雖勝利在握亦以全神對付不稍苟且余劉初以一比零占前邱江平之余劉又以二比一及三比二兩度領先至三三之後邱江全身本領方見盡量發揮未幾以六比二獲勝結果邱江三對零獲决賽權</p>

<p>A telegram from the staff office of the 9th Division, commanded by Jiang Dingwen, stated that the enemy, pressured by our army on the Jinpu Road for several days, collapsed step by step, so they poured all their strength into the Longhai area, hoping to succeed. On the 6th and 7th, Sun Chu attacked our position with three divisions and with the cover of armored trains. Our division waited patiently and fired calmly. The enemy suffered losses, advanced repeatedly, and retreated repeatedly. In the evening, they attacked again, one after another. Our defenders waited until they approached the position to about 100 meters, then used machine guns to fire. The enemy could not resist and fled in disarray. Our front-line troops took the opportunity to flank the enemy's left side. The enemy suffered even greater casualties as a result. In this battle, the corpses piled up like pillows in front of the position, and were innumerable. 400-500 rifles and countless ammunition and tools were found among the enemy corpses. According to wounded prisoners, their regimental and battalion commanders were injured when advancing, and company and platoon commanders were killed. (9th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>The drought in the United States has affected one million households, accounting for 12% of all households. It is estimated that 250,000 horses, six million cattle, and twelve million pigs and sheep have been affected. This is indeed a huge number. The U.S. population statistics have exceeded 100 million, which accounts for more than a quarter compared to China which is long known to have 400 million. Japan's naval budget for next year will break through 300 million yuan. The results of the naval reduction conference are also visible. The number of unemployed in the UK has recently exceeded two million. According to a Berlin telegram, there were a total of 2,757,000 unemployed in Germany at the end of July, an increase of one million people compared to the previous year. The daily increase in the number of unemployed shows that the recession in the world's industrial sector is evident. The total of the UK and Germany alone is nearly five million people. If other countries are added, the number would be even more alarming. In the recent general strike in France, the number of people reached over 100,000. In recent years, whenever a strike occurs, tens of thousands of people are involved. If there were global strike statistics, the staggering number would be incomparable to the number of unemployed. In short, modern popular methods, whether capital or business, are all aimed at centralization. Therefore, the calculated numbers become larger and larger. Success lies in this, and failure is also the same. Looking at the numbers mentioned above, failures outweigh successes. It is appropriate that the world is disturbed and has an uneasy appearance.</p>

<p>Determined to Break Away from Turkish Shackles</p>
<p>Declared Independence Two Years Ago</p>
<p>Relations between Turkey and Persia have suddenly become tense recently. Turkey has deployed a large army to the border to be on guard. The most recent reason is that, according to border reports, rebellious Kurdish tribes have re-entered Turkish territory from Persia to attack Turkish troops. The following is a brief account of the relationship between the Kurdish people and Turkey:</p>
<p>The Kurdish people are of Caucasian origin and have practiced Islam since the 8th century. In the mid-16th century, they developed political relations with Turkey, and in the mid-19th century, they were annexed by Turkey. Before the Great War, there were approximately 2.2 million Kurds within Turkish territory. Nearly a quarter of them died during the war, leaving 650,000 currently residing in Mesor and Northern Syria. In addition, there are another 700,000 living in Persia and 60,000 within the Caucasus. The Treaty of Sèvres in 1920 allowed for the creation of an autonomous Kurdish state, completely independent of Turkish rule, but this plan was not realized. After the Lausanne Conference in 1923, Turkish President Kemal resumed oppressive measures in Kurdistan, aiming to assimilate the Kurdish people. In the same year, the Kurds launched a major rebellion, engaging in fierce battles with 10,000 Turkish troops for five months before being quelled. After this, the Kurds retreated into the Kurdish-Aiva region at the foot of Mount Ararat and established their own government, declaring independence in October 1927. Since then, war with Turkey has not ceased. In November and December of that year, and in January, February, March, and September of 1928, the Kurds repeatedly clashed with Turkish troops. The Turkish army increased to nine divisions, but still struggled to gain the upper hand. Currently, the Turkish government has stationed over 60,000 troops in the area, confronting 20,000 Kurds. The terrain is mountainous and the roads are rugged. The Turkish troops are surrounded by enemies on all sides, and the rear is far away. The soldiers lack morale, and desertions are frequent. The Kurds are brave and skilled in combat, but lack organization and their weaponry is crude. Kemal may eventually be able to overcome the Kurds again, but the Kurdistan region produces little and cannot replenish the Turkish treasury. The Kurds are determined to be independent and difficult to restrain. The sacrifices of the Turkish government may ultimately be in vain. (World)</p>

<p>Recent Population Production Rates in Europe (Continued from the 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e103">Spain <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The country has done little to encourage production. The former dictator Rivera provided a small amount of money to families with eight children who depended on their parents, but this was only limited to poor families unable to provide for them. Spain is a Catholic country, and any promotion of birth control is prohibited. In 1887, its production rate was 35.7 per 1,000 people, but in 1928 it was 29.6.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Portugal <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The country has a high infant mortality rate. Severe penalties are imposed on those who practice birth control. The number of births is equal to the number of deaths and people emigrating. In 1918, the production rate was 34.6 per thousand, and in 1928, it was 31 per thousand.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Czechoslovakia <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The country is overpopulated, and details of birth control are unknown. In 1926, there were 344,000 births and 219,149 deaths. The government does not charge for maternity medical care, but the government is currently considering reducing penalties for those who teach birth control, which contradicts the promotion of production.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Austria <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The country's production exceeds mortality. Although the government does not promote birth control, it does not prevent the sale of contraceptives. Many small shops also sell these drugs. In Vienna alone, there are as many as 200 maternity care centers. Every day, these centers send nurses to inspect the medical care of new mothers. After giving birth, mothers receive social insurance benefits and can obtain a free basket of baby clothes. When the mother is working, the children are provided with food and care in kindergartens, and when the children reach the age of six, they can spend their summers on a health farm, part of the cost of which is provided by the state.</p>
<p>The Scandinavian Peninsula Countries</p>
<p>The countries have traditionally paid little attention to the production rate. As a result, Sweden had 23.1 per thousand in 1913, which decreased to 16.0 per thousand in 1928. Denmark was 25.6 per thousand in 1913, decreasing to 19.6 per thousand in 1928. Finland decreased from 27.1 per thousand to 23.2 per thousand, and Norway decreased from 24.9 per thousand to 17.7 per thousand. (End)</p>

However, it is heard that the King will visit the German President or attend an informal military review again. Regarding the King's purpose in going to Germany, German and French newspapers have speculated. Paris newspapers said that the King's trip is related to accelerating the development of the Mesopotamian oil field. Berlin newspapers said that the motivation for this action is mostly economic, especially because the King is eager to obtain German technical cooperation to develop domestic resources.</p>

<p>President Hoover stated today that, according to initial reports, approximately one million households are affected by the drought, accounting for 12% of the nation's households. He has instructed the Red Cross to prepare to provide relief to the victims. The President also said that the situation is very worrying, but most of the damaged agricultural products are fodder, and there is still sufficient food supply. However, the people in the disaster area are poor due to a large reduction in income and the increased burden of livestock farming in winter. It is estimated that 250,000 horses, 6 million cattle, and 12 million pigs and sheep have been affected. The President is now calling a meeting of the governors of the disaster areas to discuss disaster relief measures.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Plans to Formulate a Plan to Facilitate Transportation</p>
<p>Requests Joint Handling by the Ministries of Communications and Railways</p>
<p>In order to alleviate the issue of cheap gold and expensive silver, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce previously formulated a plan to facilitate transportation and requested joint handling by the Ministries of Communications and Railways. The full text is extracted below:</p>
<h3 id="e120">(1) Reorganization of Water Transport <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>(A) Reorganization of Sailing and River Vessels and Establishment of Our Own Domestic Shipping Company. The number of shipping vessels is few, and many have been damaged due to military requisition over the years. The government should first provide as much subsidies as possible to allow for reorganization and addition of vessels in order to facilitate domestic transportation, and then gradually prepare for international navigation, directly exporting domestic products to foreign countries. This can both recover shipping rights and promote exports, achieving both benefits. (B) Dredging and Connecting Canals and Major Ports. Water transport is heavy and inexpensive, so European and American countries, despite having railway networks, still spare no effort to develop canals to connect major rivers within the country. Although our country cannot say this, there have been successful canals in the past between Zhili, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and between Hunan and Guangxi. If they can be dredged and connected, then the goods of the three major basins of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stretching thousands of miles north and south, can be transported by water. No other country has this natural advantage. In addition to the existing ports, such as Linhongkou in Jiangsu, Chongming Port, and Sanmen Bay in Zhejiang, efforts should be made to dredge and manage them to facilitate export nearby. In short, for canals and major ports, dredge those that are silted up and continue those that are interrupted, so that the veins are connected and transportation is naturally smooth. This project can be implemented by military engineers or through work-for-food locally. The cost is not much, but the results are significant. (C) Application of Small Wheel Tugboats and Barges. Using small wheel tugboats and barges can supplement the limitations of sailing ships and still make use of sailing vessels. Currently, sailing vessels line the major rivers, and they can indeed transport large quantities of goods, but navigation is slow, and it is difficult to predict the schedule in the event of wind and rain. If the method of promoting small wheel tugboats and barges is adopted, it will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort. The transportation of sailing vessels in the inland rivers of the provinces should also be subject to this method. If inland river shallow water patrol boats can be used, it will be even more effective in providing protection.</p>
<h3 id="e121">(2) Reorganization of Land Transport <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>(A) Expanding Transportation Equipment. Although there are many reasons for the recent obstruction and reduction of the export of goods, the lack of locomotives and insufficient vehicles are the main reasons. Therefore, the competent authorities should actively expand in various ways in order to fundamentally alleviate the problem and relieve the merchants. (B) Increasing the Number of Trips. Currently, vehicles are lacking and replenishment is not complete, resulting in too few trips. I have investigated the methods of the South Manchurian Railway, where there is a passenger or freight train every few moments. It is difficult to talk about this in our current situation, but both to facilitate merchants and travelers and for the sake of railway economics, it seems appropriate to increase the number of train trips as much as possible within a possible range, in addition to expanding transportation equipment to meet the needs. Also, the duration of time that vehicles stop at stations should be strictly audited to prevent the withholding of supplies. (C) Strict Prohibition of Withholding Vehicles. In recent years, due to the war, military transportation has been busy and withholding vehicles was a temporary necessity. Now that the country is initially stabilized and construction has begun, passenger and freight trains on each route urgently need to be restored. The competent authorities should strictly formulate military transport regulations, ordering the troops to strictly comply and not withhold vehicles under any pretext. All vehicles previously withheld by various armies should be returned in full immediately, so that road administration will not be obstructed and goods can flow smoothly. (D) Use of Automobile Transportation. Wherever waterways are impassable and railways are not installed, if there is a large output of goods that needs to be linked to waterways or railways, a highway should be built and automobiles should be used for transportation. In European and American countries, automobile transportation has long occupied an important position, and its cost is lower. The effectiveness of the road is also wider, which is more convenient than railways, which can only be operated by locomotives.</p>
<h3 id="e122">(3) Improving Domestic and International Combined Transportation <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Goods are often stockpiled in transit due to the failure of time to connect, which often results in losses. Therefore, domestic trade focuses on combined water and land transport, and foreign trade focuses on international combined transport. Timely connection and simple procedures are both necessary conditions. Relevant departments should send personnel to jointly study with representatives elected by the chambers of commerce in order to facilitate implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e123">(4) Strict Prohibition of Extra Exorbitant Tolls on Freight <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Transportation has a fixed amount, and extra exorbitant tolls will only enrich corrupt officials and make it more difficult for merchants. Those who demand exorbitant tolls create various pretexts, such as expedited fees, military donations, and escort fees, which are endless. An investigation should be conducted and the government should issue a clear order to prohibit them all.</p>
<h3 id="e124">(5) Preferential Treatment for Transportation of Special Products <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The nature of items differs, and the standards of transportation differ. The amount of fees charged and the priority of promotion should be specified according to the importance of each item and be reasonably regulated. (A) Reduce Freight Rates. 1. The raw materials and fuels necessary for domestic goods manufacturing and the fuels necessary for machinery industry should be charged at a reduced rate to reduce costs and encourage the promotion of domestic goods. 2. For domestic manufactured goods that compete with imported goods, reduce freight rates so that prices are cheaper and they can be sold in the market. (B) Prioritize Transportation. 1. For goods that are time-sensitive, such as fruits, eggs, and livestock, they may spoil or die if they are delayed, so transportation should be prioritized to benefit merchants. 2. For food grains related to people's livelihood, transportation should be prioritized to benefit people's livelihood. 3. For raw materials, fuels, and manufactured goods used in industry, because domestic goods compete with imported goods in the market, the timing of transporting raw materials, fuels, and manufactured goods also has a huge impact, so transportation should be prioritized to benefit industry.</p>

<p>Those engaged in transportation in various places often collude widely, or privately unpack packages, or mix in cement and steal. This is inevitable. The transportation authorities should strictly stipulate penalties to crack down on such activities.</p>

<p>In recent years, due to frequent wars, bandits have arisen in various places, killing and robbing, which has caused merchants and travelers to stop moving forward. Measures should be taken to protect them. Therefore, in addition to a large-scale clearing of villages, the state should consider reorganizing the surplus troops into transportation security teams to accompany cargo vehicles and ships along the way for security.</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After Zhu Mao abandoned Gaoan and invaded Anyi from Fengxin, they had the potential to flee along the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway and Jiujiang. It is now heard that the bandits have fled to the Xinqizhou area of the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway. All circles in Jiujiang and Li Liejun, who lives in Mount Lu, are concerned that Zhu Mao will disrupt the Nanchang-Jiujiang area and that the bandits from the Hubei border will attempt to attack Jiujiang from Ruichang. The situation is very critical, so they successively sent telegrams to Director Tan, Chief of General Staff Zhu, and Commander-in-Chief Liu to report the emergency. Commander-in-Chief Lu has now sent four regiments of troops to defend the Tujiapu and Jianchang areas of the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway. Tan, Zhu, and Liu have also sent telegrams to Xún saying that they have added several warships and two regiments of troops to Xún to suppress the situation. The telegrams are as follows:</p>

<p>Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway Operating as Usual</p>
<p>No Bandit Traces Seen Near Nanchang</p>
<p>Wuhan Correspondence: Director He Yingqin of the Wuhan Headquarters believes that the Communist bandits of Zhu Mao in Jiangxi Province are like roving bandits, who often cause disturbances and greatly hinder local security. In order to understand the true situation of the Communist bandits in order to send troops to suppress them, yesterday evening (7th), he specially ordered the squadron leaders Zhang Yougu and Ye Zhijian of the 1st and 5th Aviation Squadrons stationed in Wuhan to each fly two new-style fighter planes to reconnoiter the bandit traces in the vicinity of Nanchang, Fengxin, De'an, and Tianjiazhen in Jiujiang, and to carry a large number of bombs to bomb when necessary. At 7:00 a.m. today (8th), squadron leader Zhang Yougu of the 1st Aviation Squadron, accompanied by pilot Yuan Liren, and deputy squadron leader Ye Zhijian of the 5th Squadron, accompanied by observer Zhang Weifan, each flew a new plane at 6:00 a.m. At the time when the red sun was rising and the morning clouds were hazy, they flew off. They flew east along the Yangtze River through Qishui, Qichun, Jiujiang, and Tianjiazhen, and then inspected along Fengxin, Anyi, Yongxiu, and De'an. From 10:00 to 11:00 a.m., the two planes returned to Wuhan after completing their mission. The two squadron leaders, Zhang and Ye, went to the headquarters to report the situation to Director He. They said that there were many passengers at the stations of the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway, and the trains were operating as usual. All the important stations were guarded by troops. The vicinity of Nanchang was peaceful as usual. Merchants in Fengxin, Anyi, Yongxiu, De'an, and other places came and went. No bandit traces were found. There were no large Communist bandits in Qishui, Qichun, Jiujiang, and Tianjiazhen, and there were no special circumstances. The travelers along the way were also calm and unhurried, and the atmosphere was calm.</p>
<p>According to news from the headquarters, in order to suppress the local bandits in Yunmeng and Luoshan, Director He has, in addition to sending strong troops to suppress them, also ordered the Aviation Squadron to send three or four Tekroce and Kessay fighter planes to bomb at any opportunity to assist the army in suppressing them in order to eliminate them in one fell swoop.

<p>Feng Ying, the commander of the 3rd Battalion of the Garrison Regiment, previously led two companies of soldiers to Nanling to suppress bandits. When the bandits saw the government troops arrive, they fled to the Xinningpu area. They are currently being pursued. Feng led a platoon of soldiers back to Wuhu today due to an incident and brought the captured bandit leaders Ding Tangming and Zhao Jingwu to Wuhu for interrogation.</p>
<p>The wounded soldiers caused trouble in the brothel the night before last, gathering two to three hundred people. The 3rd Battalion of the Wuhu Garrison Regiment and the Public Security Bureau's Security Team, for the sake of local security, shot and killed one wounded soldier and injured several others on the spot. Afterwards, they telegraphed the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters and the 9th Division Headquarters of the Anhui Provincial Government to report the incident and requested instructions from the headquarters. The wounded soldiers have now put forward conditions such as punishing the murderers and providing compensation. The soldier who was killed was buried today, and the Public Security Bureau sent a team to pay their respects. The injured have also requested a court examination.</p>

<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Zhou Zhiqun's Brigade under Lu Xingbang's command in the northern route recently took advantage of a stormy night to attack the Xiaobeiling position of Liu's division and engaged in battle with Chen Wantai's brigade. The two sides held each other for the entire night until dawn, when Zhou's brigade finally retreated. Chen's brigade also held the original defense and did not pursue. The battle then ceased again. However, after Zhou's brigade retreated, they vented their anger on Lu Xingrong's brigade and Lu Xinghui's battalion for observing and not advancing, resulting in no support in the rear. They telegraphed Lu Xingbang, who then transferred Lu Xinghui's battalion back to Yanping and detained them. As for the provincial military affairs, they are now awaiting the completion of the deployment in southern Fujian before launching a general offensive at the same time.</p>
<p>The provincial government had previously advised the Lu Xingbang and Xingrong brothers to relinquish their military power and leave Fujian to preserve their lives and property. However, the Lu brothers not only did not reply but accepted the order of the commander of the 19th Army in the north and actively mobilized troops and deployed defenses to prolong the war. Therefore, the provincial government specially compiled their illegal acts over the years into a list of crimes and reprinted leaflets to be distributed by aircraft to inform the officers and soldiers of Lu's troops and the people of northern Fujian. The contents of the printed matter are divided into fourteen items: 1. Betraying the Central Government and kidnapping the Provincial Committee; 2. Disobeying orders and not complying with demobilization; 3. Accepting false orders and raising troops in Fuzhou; 4. Destroying party affairs and arresting assigned committee members; 5. Privately manufacturing guns and ammunition to plot against the party and the country; 6. Privately setting up taxes to suck the people's fat; 7. Plotting to control salt transportation and monopolize salt prices; 8. Establishing casinos and publicly selling opium; 9. Selling guns to bandits to poison the people; 10. Abusing power and employing private individuals; 11. Kidnapping people for ransom and raping women; 12. Harboring local bullies and planting henchmen; 13. Buying off Zhou Wei and prolonging the disaster together; 14. Intercepting tax money and extorting military expenses. The full text is no less than two thousand words. (August 5)</p>
<h3 id="e135">Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau Will Be Under the Direct Jurisdiction of the Provincial Government <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>After the reorganization of the municipal government, it will be renamed the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Investigation of the Internal Organization of the Municipal Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Guangzhou Municipal Government originally had six bureaus, with the Public Security Bureau being one of them. Because the bureau holds police power and is responsible for the security of the provincial capital, its position is particularly important compared to other bureaus. Recently, the provincial government intends to expand the bureau into a police department to unify police power throughout the province. Since the police department is an old name, it was decided to rename the Municipal Public Security Bureau as the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau and expand its power to be under the provincial government. The organizational law of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau has been drafted by the Department of Civil Affairs. The reorganization of the bureau will have to wait until the reorganization of the Guangzhou Special Municipal Government is completed, because the bureau is still under the Special Municipal Government. As long as the words "Special Municipal" are not removed, the bureau will not be able to be reorganized by order of the provincial government. As for the recent internal organization of the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau and its strength, those who are concerned about Guangdong politics want to know. The following is a brief record of the findings of the investigation. The Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, as the name suggests, has jurisdiction over the Guangzhou city area, which covers an area of approximately 75 square miles. The area has a population of 185,535 households and 854,335 people (based on statistics from April 19). The city has 29 public security sub-bureaus, one directly under the sub-bureau, and ten police teams. There are four types of police teams: guard posts, traffic, special service, and fire brigade. There are also four security brigades. There are 398 police officers, 276 of whom graduated from the police academy. There are 524 employees, 274 police chiefs, and 5,061 police officers. 917 police officers graduated from the police training school. There are a total of 1,978 servants, of whom 1,279 are sanitation workers. The bureau also has a fire brigade with eight fire engines and dozens of team members. In addition, the bureau also has a detective section with at least 100 detectives and political detectives. Each police officer is equipped with a short gun, and special police and armed police are equipped with long guns. In total, the police have 5,020 guns, and the security brigade has 944 long guns. The bureau's expenses are mostly dependent on the house rent police fee, which has now been changed to a public security fee, which is collected at a rate of 2% of the house rental amount. The funds are considered sufficient. In its current state, the bureau's fixed monthly expenses are approximately 200,000 yuan. (August 5)</p>
<h3 id="e136">Singapore Restricts the Import of Chinese Labor <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Monthly Limit of More Than 4,400 People</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: The British government of Singapore in the Nanyang region, due to the suspension of tin mines, the drop in rubber prices, and the impact of expensive gold on the decline in local products, and the large number of unemployed Chinese laborers, has issued an order restricting the import of Chinese laborers starting on August 1. Among the overseas Chinese in Nanyang, the number of people from southern Fujian is the largest, followed by Chaozhou and Shantou. As a result of the order, the British consulates in Xiamen and Shantou restricted the export of Chinese laborers, and the Hong Kong government also restricted the export of Chinese laborers from Guangzhou. GarnJlones, the British consul in Xiamen, notified the shipping companies that operate between Singapore and Xiamen or via Xiamen to Singapore to limit the number of passengers they carry. The Java Company's two ships have a monthly limit of 800 people, the Yaja Company's five ships have a monthly limit of 500 people, the Jardine Matheson Company's six ships have a monthly limit of 460 people, the Taikoo Yanghang's five ships have a monthly limit of 1,610 people, the Hetong Company's three ships have a monthly limit of 810 people, and the Hesheng Company's one ship has a monthly limit of 220 people, for a total of 4,430 people on 32 ships of six companies per month, or 53,160 people per year. Compared to the 84,500 people who went to Nanyang from Xiamen last year, this is a decrease of more than 30,000 people. As for the British government's reason for restricting the import of Chinese laborers this time: (1) The tin mines in Malaya have been suspended, and there is no need for foreign workers. (2) In recent years, the prices of rubber, coffee, coconuts, pepper, and dried honey produced in the Malay Peninsula have fallen sharply, especially rubber. Recently, the impact of expensive gold has further reduced the prices of products, resulting in slow sales and a sharp increase in worker unemployment. According to a survey by the local government, there are more than 1,578,000 Chinese laborers in various ports of the Malay Peninsula, and more than 148,600 people are currently unemployed. Although there are many unemployed Chinese laborers, there is still a growing number of people continuing to come to Malaya to make a living. These newly arrived Chinese laborers are all affected by the internal banditry and are forced to make a living overseas. Their wages are lower than those of the native Malay workers. Malay workers are also suffering from this blow and unemployment is also increasing. In order to maintain the lives of Malay workers, the British government has adopted a policy of restricting the import of Chinese laborers to reduce the unemployment of colonial people. It is said that the British government's restriction on the import of Chinese laborers is a trial period of three months. If there are no adverse effects at that time, it will continue to be implemented. During the restriction period, if Chinese laborers are still unemployed, they will be returned at any time. Also, this time, Shantou and Hong Kong simultaneously restricted imports, and the three ports will reduce the export volume of Chinese laborers by 20% compared to last year. There are many overseas Chinese from Shantou and Chaozhou entering British territories (overseas Chinese from southern Fujian are mostly in Dutch territories), so the restrictions are also strict. It is estimated that the combined number of people from Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangdong will decrease by more than 100,000 people per year. However, first and second class passengers who are not laborers and women and children are not restricted. The Nanyang passenger ticket companies in Xiamen have temporarily followed the regulations due to the shipping companies' compliance with the order to restrict passengers. It is said that they will petition the Siming County Government for negotiation, but the price of third-class tickets to Singapore has already risen from 20 yuan to 32 yuan. (5th)</p>
<h3 id="e137">The Forests of Northern Manchuria Are Almost Completely Destroyed <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Mountains Above Yimianpo Are Barren</p>
<p>They Will Be Completely Felled in Another Ten Years</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The forests of northern Manchuria are the best in the country. In the past, the forests of Manchuria were connected for hundreds of miles. The firewood produced was not only sold in the eastern provinces, but also transported by sea to the south of the Yangtze River and by the Yalu River to Japan. A significant amount was also transported to Europe every year. Since the construction of the Eastern Railway, the right to cut down forests along the railway was granted, and the areas of Jidong with abundant timber were owned by Russia. For the past thirty years, Chinese were almost not allowed to interfere with the forest harvesting rights, and most of the timber harvested was used as fuel for locomotives, resulting in repeated felling and barren mountains. Now, the famous forests in the eastern mountains of Jilin are becoming increasingly scarce. All the mountains below Yimianpo have no trees left. Forests can be found occasionally above Hengdaohezi, but the timber produced is not as lush as in the past. The old pines and giant cypresses of hundreds of feet and the dark and vast forest spectacles are also gone. According to a foreign survey, the forests along the Eastern Railway have been severely damaged and there is no artificial cultivation method. Once the forests are completely felled, the land will be reclaimed as barren mountains and the young trees will not grow up before the old trees are cut down. It is feared that in another ten years, the eastern provinces will have a shortage of timber. This shows that the forests in northern Manchuria have been excessively felled. Currently, those who hold forest felling rights in northern Manchuria, in addition to the Eastern Railway Forestry Bureau, include two individuals who operate privately: Russians "Ge Walinski" and "Xie Jiesi". The forest area of these two individuals is more than 200 square miles. The state-owned operators include Tongyuan Timber Company and the Sino-Japanese joint venture Zhalan Timber Company and Hailin Timber Company. These forest farms are operated by Russian individuals who have no intention of supporting young trees or cultivating forests. They only know how to cut down trees day and night with sharp tools, fearing that the output will be small. The authorities do not know how to develop forestry. In the future, after the foreign businessmen leave fully loaded, they will only leave behind a barren mountain. This is the current situation of forestry in northern Manchuria. Foreigners who do not know the situation still mistakenly believe that the forests of northern Manchuria are as prosperous as they used to be. (August 4)</p>
<h3 id="e138">Security Conference of Military and Police in Anhui <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Six Measures to Maintain Security Were Decided</p>
<p>Anqing Dispatch: Tang Yunshan, commander of the Independent 15th Brigade stationed in Anhui, led his troops to Qianshan to suppress bandits in Qianshan, Taihu, and Ying counties in accordance with the resolution of the joint meeting of the Security Department. The defense of Anhui City was taken over by the Security Department and the 15th Route Army. Therefore, a portion of the security team under the Security Department has been transferred from Dajiang Ferry to various places in the province for defense. The training regiment of the 15th Route Army, the engineer battalion, and various merchant groups have also stepped up their defenses. Lei Guangwen, the commander of the 15th Route Army's garrison and the director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, convened a temporary meeting yesterday with the military police inspection office and the captains of the Public Security Bureau's sub-bureaus and decided on the following six cases: (1) Starting from the 6th of this month, the military police inspection office will dispatch four shifts to cooperate with the officers and police of the Public Security Bureau's sub-bureaus to strictly enforce the regulations on the management of travelers in inns inside and outside the city. Travelers coming to the province must obtain a guarantor from the store on the same day, otherwise they will not be allowed to stay. If there is any violation, the owner of the inn will be held responsible. (2) The military police inspection office will cooperate with the police officers of the water patrol to strictly inspect the travelers and luggage coming and going from the wharves and affix a stamped certificate before allowing them to pass. If there are any reactionary publications or any suspicious signs, they will be arrested immediately to prevent chaos. (3) It has been repeatedly reported in secret that the Communist Party has sent vagrant refugees from Hankou and other places to various places in an attempt to incite disturbances and disrupt security. If strict precautions are not taken, it will be insufficient to maintain local security. Starting from the 10th of this month, all refugees who have already come to the province must obtain a guarantor from the store within a certain period, otherwise they will be expelled from the country. Refugees who are about to arrive will not be allowed to land. (4) The security of the provincial capital is extremely important. The sub-bureaus and detective teams will select disguised police officers to be dispatched to various places for strict investigation. If they encounter reactionary elements or communist party members, they will be arrested immediately. (5) The guards at each city gate will inspect travelers coming and going who have suspicious signs. (6) Every day from 12:00 midnight to 4:00 the next morning, the military and police will implement a password system. Those who do not know the password will not be allowed to pass and will be arrested immediately. (August 8)</p>

<p>Since the robbery case in Hougang, residents in nearby areas such as Mapeng and Xin Street have been receiving threatening letters from bandits every day. It is said that at the end of last month, the Jin Yuelou teahouse in Tinglin received a bandit letter instructing them to forward 2,000 yuan to Gu Xiaoxiang and 3,000 yuan to a Mr. Jin, and a letter to Liu Jia, Liu Baoxiang, demanding 1,500 yuan. After receiving the letter, Gu Jin fled elsewhere. Liu Baoxiang still lived in the countryside. On the evening of the fourth day, at dusk, a loud knock was suddenly heard on the door. Liu quickly jumped up and instructed his family to hide temporarily, throwing a roll of 20 yuan of banknotes out of the window in the hope of avoiding the bandits' trampling. However, the knocking continued as before. Liu had no choice but to shout for help inside. Neighbors heard the alarm and shouted together to catch the thieves. The thieves did not dare to stay and fired two shots before leaving. The neighbors saw that there were five or six bandits, all with guns. They probably fled because there were many villagers. However, the victim did not dare to live in his hometown anymore.</p>

The case has been tried several times, and it was originally intended to be sentenced to death. Fortunately, Chen's mother-in-law repeatedly pleaded for leniency, so he was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment with shackles on the 8th of this month.</p>

<p>In the past two months, all those with slight assets in Wujiaqiao Town have received bandit letters demanding loans of three to four hundred yuan. It is said that at the time, because they did not dare to expect punishment, most of them prepared the money and paid it in order to avoid trouble. However, the town suddenly received a threatening letter from the Shanghai Post Office the day before yesterday, stating that it had been reported that the First Army of Taihu would come to the town to loot within ten days and would be detrimental to certain families. The letter said that the army knew that the merchants in the town were quite righteous and could not bear to sit idly by, so it was specially sent to inform them to prepare in advance and that certain families should leave quickly to avoid harm. The people in the town were panicked upon receiving this news, and some even moved their entire families to avoid it. In order to maintain order, the town office decided to immediately implement special martial law and specially sent Wang Daoming to the county today to request the stationing of troops to assist in maintaining order.</p>

<p>Wei Zumo, director of the Wuxian Construction Bureau, in order to renovate Guanqian Street and expand the street area, ordered the shops in Guanqian to move and rebuild by July 15 and complete the work by September 15. Therefore, the road surface and ditches have been excavated. However, although the shops on both sides of Zhengshanmen have been vacated, the merchants of each shop intend to rebuild the houses there into three-story buildings to increase the view. However, the county government decided in a meeting that only flat houses would be allowed to be built. Therefore, the merchants have been holding a wait-and-see attitude and have not hired workers to demolish the buildings. Wei Zumo, director of the Construction Bureau, was deeply concerned that the shops were delaying and that the deadline would be exceeded. Therefore, yesterday, he specially hired a large number of Jiangbei workers to forcibly demolish the buildings and ordered the landlords to build them within a time limit.</p>

In addition to Captain Wang Wusheng and Zheng Xin, a member of the Dongshan Defense Corps, who escaped danger on the same day, the following people escaped danger the previous day: Inspector Huang Wangmin, Pu Minghua, the accountant of the Dalu Small Ferry, Yu Bokang, the accountant of the Feihu Small Ferry, passengers Zhu Rongsheng, Zhou Zhaoqi, Zhou Fan, Xi Yichun, Qian Ziqin, Ge Shousheng, Song Yu, Li Xu, Yang Wanlun, Wang Asheng, Yang Han, and his 14-year-old son, for a total of sixteen people.

<p>The Deshiji Kerosene Company on Hengma Road outside Guanmen purchased 600 boxes of Happiness brand kerosene from the Shanghai head office last month, worth about 5,000 yuan. Hai Gu, a ship bureau, hired the shipowner Wu Fuyuan to transport it to Suzhou on the 26th of last month. The local branch has not seen it arrive for many days, so it sent a letter to the ship bureau for inquiries. The bureau found that Wu's ship had not returned to Shanghai. After investigation, it was learned that Wu had a shipmate named Ji who was in Wuxi. Therefore, on the 6th of this month, they sent someone to report to the Wuxi County Police Team, who arrested Ji. Ji confessed that after the ship arrived at the Damaji Bridge outside Loumen, Suzhou on the 2nd of this month, Wu Fuyuan brought people to the ship the next day and transported 200 boxes of goods away. On the third day, they transported the remaining 400 boxes completely. Yesterday, Xie Fengtai learned the news and found that Xiangxing Leji, located at No. 2 Taohuawu, had purchased the stolen goods. Therefore, he reported the information to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, and Patrol Officer Xu Boying went to arrest Shi Jinquan, the manager of the store. Shi Jinquan confessed that Zhang Jiantang (also known as Zhang Bin, the owner of the Minsheng Firecracker Factory) from outside the Gate of the Gods introduced him to buy the kerosene. There were a total of 573 boxes, 100 boxes were sold to Dalongsheng Rice Shop on Heyan Street, 100 boxes were sold to Tongfu outside Loumen, and he bought 350 boxes for himself, each box costing 5 yuan and 6 jiao. There were also 23 boxes that Zhang Jiantang bought himself. He took three boxes home for use and stored the remaining boxes in his shop. As a result, Patrol Officer Xu and the detective team arrested Zhang Jiantang outside Nantongzimen, brought him to the bureau, and also arrested Wu Fuyuan for questioning.</p>

<p>The First Squadron of the 14th Water Police Team and the Second Squadron of the Guerrilla Team searched for the remnants of the bandits in the area of Laotaimiao in Miaoqian Xigang. The gunboats were stopped near the temple, and small fishing boats were hired in disguise to investigate Laotaimiao. Two plainclothes police officers were sent to disguise themselves as redemption negotiators of the kidnapped victims in Dongshan and patrol back and forth. At 11:00 pm on the 8th, several bandits disguised as farmers came to negotiate the redemption of the tickets. They asked what kind of boat the small fishing boat was. The water police replied that it was the one who came to receive the redemption tickets. The bandits said that it was not right and opened fire. The two plainclothes police officers also opened fire with their box cannons. The main force of the gunboats immediately advanced and opened fire for one hour. Four Taihu bandits were killed on the spot, a box cannon and dozens of rounds of ammunition were seized, and the head of the small bandit leader of Taihu was taken down and hung in front of the temple for public display. Currently, the remnants of the Taihu bandits are divided into two groups: Zhong Zhaokui and Zhou A'si and Wang Zhongyi, who are still hiding in the reeds of Yangcheng Lake.</p>

<h3 id="e157">River-Sedimented Bandits of Jiangyin Escorted Back to Face Trial <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The Eighth Branch of the Xiyi Public Security Bureau previously apprehended seven bandits, namely Zhang Xuetang, Wang Baochuan, Chen A'da, Huang Dabao, Wang A'er, Sun Guanshi, and Gong Zhangshi, along with a suspect named Miao Xianglin, at the Huishang Inn outside the North Gate of Tantou Lane in Xiyi. They also seized seven homemade bombs and a quantity of stolen goods, which were all escorted to the county for interrogation. It has now been learned that the captured criminals often used aliases and committed multiple crimes in Jiangyin. For example, Zhang Xuetang's real name is Gong Baogen, Wang Baochuan's real name is Zhang A'ba, Chen A'da's real name is Zhang Fuqing, Huang Dabao's real name is Zhang Enbao, and Wang A'er's real name is Zhang A'er. All are long-time bandits in Jiangyin who have used aliases. Gong Chenshi is Gong Baogen's wife. Furthermore, Gong Baogen sent a letter to Zhu Dabao, a resident of Gongjiatan in Jiangyin County, on July 16th, demanding 2,000 silver dollars under threat. Recently, the Jiangyin authorities learned that Gong and his accomplices had been arrested in Xiyi. Yesterday, they dispatched Zhu, the head of the Fifth Jia Protective Corps of the Fourteenth District of Jiangyin County, to Xiyi by boat to identify the bandits. Confirming that they were indeed the river-sedimented bandits of Jiangyin, the county government prepared a document ordering the police to escort the bandits back to Jiangyin for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Clues to the Sun Lane Robbery Case <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Sun family of Sun Leikui (also known as Jin Kui) in Sun Lane, Yinqiao Township, the Sixteenth District of Xiyi (i.e., Wan'an City), was robbed and the head of the household was injured the other night. In addition to robbing silver dollars and land deeds, the bandits burned all the IOUs. Furthermore, on the morning of the robbery, Sun Leikui's son, Deqing (an acupuncturist), had treated someone for a fright at Yu Fulin's house. Therefore, when the bandits entered the Sun family's home, they impersonated Fulin, falsely claiming to be there for medical assistance. When the bandits left, they said that if Sun wanted the land deeds back, he could entrust Yang Peicheng to bring money to redeem them. However, Yang Peicheng used to be a teacher in the Sun family and is known to be upright, thus making it a clear attempt to frame him. Judging from the bandits' burning of IOUs and their words, they must be familiar with the family. The clues are plentiful, and it should not be difficult to solve the case. Currently, both the Yang and Yu families, as well as local gentry, have issued statements to avoid being implicated. Sun Leikui came to the city the day before yesterday to report the injuries to the county and request the arrest of the bandits.</p>

Seeing that he had caused a disaster, the squad leader gathered his subordinates, defense soldiers, and nearby bandits to carry out a large-scale robbery. It is said that pawnshops and money shops suffered the greatest losses. The squad leader also took all the guns in the town and fled.</p>

<p>In Qiujiagang, the southeastern village of Sixian, some bandits with guns have asked for money and guns in villages since several months ago, frequently causing disturbance. On July 28th, they gathered five or six hundred local ruffians, hooligans, beggars and bandits, and surrounded Shangtangji in the fourth district, very aggressively. However, the public officials of the district office and all the officers and soldiers of the Self-Defense Corps, using various excuses, ignored the defense. The public were in a hurry. The local militia in the market area implemented self-defense. While the fight was going on, the officers and soldiers of the self-defense corps suddenly mutinied and threw themselves into the communist party, opening fire on the militia. The militia suffered heavy casualties from internal and external attacks. The Southeast was extremely chaotic. Later, Ma Hanzhang, Zhang Wenbo and others of the second district personally led the Self-Defense Corps and the local militia to rush to aid the villagers at night, and finally repelled the bandits. It is said that they are still entrenched in the southern part of the city, gathering more and more, and their momentum is huge. The residents of the city and countryside are extremely alarmed.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Construction Public Debt was allocated to Pinghu this time, with an amount of 280,000 yuan. After receiving the order, County Head Fang Li convened a meeting of wealthy people in the county, but due to the famine years, there were no concrete results. After several meetings, only a few people attended, and there was no real progress. County Head Fang, due to his responsibilities, reported the difficulties in raising funds to the province and also ran to Beijing and Shanghai to solicit donations from fellow villagers abroad. He repeatedly tried to arrange for the allocation of the Zhao Highway Public Debt (according to the highway public debt, Pingyi was allocated 100,000 yuan). While the matter was in progress, Chairman Zhang of this province sent separate letters to various wealthy households, designating allocations, totaling 486,000 yuan. The original quota for the general wealthy households was already difficult to allocate, but now it has exceeded more than half, which is unbearable. Therefore, they have jointly stated their difficulty in meeting the quota.</p>

<p>Recently, a new Shaoxing speedboat has been operating on the Xitang to Xiadianmiao Taozhuang route. It travels very quickly, and passengers are crowded. Yesterday, near Xiadianmiao, a bandit ship sailed head-on and fired a gun to force it to stop. Passengers already had bandits mixed inside, who forced the driver to kill the engine and searched each passenger. No one was spared. The total loss was more than 600 yuan. A Mr. Gong, a bill collector, had more than 300 yuan stolen. Some say that Gong's funds were exposed, which led to the bandits' covetousness and the occurrence of this robbery.</p>

<p>The home of Miao Heshang, who lives in Baishuitang outside the South Gate, was attacked by many bandits at 8:00 PM on the 3rd. Fortunately, the neighbors noticed and came out to arrest them, and the bandits fled. However, his son was shot and killed by the bandits in Jiashan Hospital. Afterwards, the volunteer defense regiment reported the incident and went to Wangjia Wall inside Dali Port outside the South Gate, where they arrested Han Qijin and his wife, as well as the wife of the bandit Han Achen and several others. They also recovered a six-year-old boy hostage who spoke with a Songhu accent. Han Achen escaped and has not been apprehended. Han Qijin and others were transferred to the county for investigation.

<p>Rice prices in Jiaxing have always been manipulated by rice merchants, so the prices sold are always more expensive than other ports. After social figures appealed to the party and government for relief, a joint party and government meeting was held five days ago, and members of the Rice Price Evaluation Committee were invited to participate. It was resolved that various rice prices would be appropriately reduced from the 6th to benefit the people. However, the agreed prices were still more expensive than those in Jiashan, Pinghu, Xiashi, and other places, so the citizens were not very satisfied. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 6th, Yushui Rice Shop outside the North City of this port sold Dongmi to Yu Yongchang's Line Workshop for 17 yuan and 6 jiao (exceeding the resolution by 7 jiao), and Dajiao was still sold for 15 yuan (exceeding the resolution by 3 yuan). Someone held a statement and reported the matter to the party headquarters for investigation. It is learned that the party headquarters has decided to send a letter to the county for severe punishment of the case and to designate the funds collected from the fine to supplement the construction costs of the Seven Martyrs Memorial Pagoda and the Zhongshan Park construction to serve as a warning to others.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Letter from Jingjiang County Public Security Bureau <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>We were surprised to read in the Jingjiang Communication column of your newspaper on July 31st that the county police team and the public security bureau had a conflict over a soil inspection, which is not in line with the facts. Upon investigation, County Chief Wang of our county secretly dispatched Captain Wang of the County Police Team to lead more than ten plainclothes officers in batches to the 8th District based on the report that a large amount of opium would be unloaded at the docks of the 6th, 7th, and 8th Districts. The officers dispatched to the 8th District did not have any official documents or symbols with them. When they arrived at the port, they were spotted by the public security bureau's patrol officers, who reported to Bureau Chief Chen of the bureau that two people wearing plainclothes and carrying box guns were at the Yidu Pier as if waiting for the ferry. Bureau Chief Chen went to investigate and found three people there. Upon questioning, they claimed to be officers of the police team. Because it was a time of martial law and there was no way to prove that they were officers, he had to temporarily disarm them. Later, Captain Wang arrived and provided proof for them, and Bureau Chief Chen immediately returned their weapons and sent police to assist in their work. During the inspection of passengers, a certain officer of the team had a conflict with the head of the security group of the port over the right of way. The head of the group's clothes were torn by the officer, and they were immediately brought to the Public Security Bureau. While they were arguing over the merits of the case, the officers of the 6th District had arrived and saw their colleagues arguing with others, and without asking the facts, they started arguing with Bureau Chief Chen, starting with insults and then with beatings. After Captain Wang stopped them, both sides reported to County Chief Wang, who punished the troublemaking group police separately. There was no incident of soil conflict as reported in your newspaper. It is assumed that your newspaper's interviewer did not get the true facts of the matter when interviewing. Fearing that the rumors would be inaccurate, we dare to send you this letter detailing the situation and requesting that it be published in the Letters section for correction. We eagerly await your response. Jingjiang County Public Security Bureau, Water Police Security Group, Third Detachment, August 7th.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Overview of Education in Britain and America <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>According to the survey of the International Bureau of Education in Geneva, the recent situation of education in Britain and the United States is summarized below:</p>
<h3 id="e193">Schools in Various Regions of Wales, UK <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>According to the recent statistics report of the British Ministry of Education, the number of students in elementary schools in various places in Wales last year was decreasing, while the number of students in secondary schools increased by 1,563. The number of students in elementary schools decreased by 5,482. The reason for the decrease in the number of students in elementary schools is that most unemployed labor families have moved to other places, and the national birth rate has decreased by more than 33% in the past ten years. With the decrease in the number of students, the number of students in each class has also decreased. The largest number of classes had 16 classes, each with more than 60 students. The next largest number had more than 400 classes, each with 50 students. The ratio of students to teachers is 38 teachers for every 1,000 elementary school students, of which 24 have been registered and licensed as teachers by local educational institutions, 12 have not gone through this procedure, and the remaining 2 are supplementary teachers. The number of secondary school students in 1928 totaled 36,804, of which 19,277 were males and 17,527 were females. According to the survey last year, the total number had increased to 38,367, of which 20,145 were males and more than 18,000 were females, an increase of 868 males and 695 females, for a total increase of 1,563 male and female students. The ratio of students to the population is 14 secondary school students per 1,000 people. The average cost of education is 23 pounds, 9 shillings, and 6 pence per year for each secondary school student. The highest cost of living is 27 pounds and 7 shillings per year, and the lowest cost of living is only 19 pounds and 14 shillings.</p>

<p>The total number of primary and secondary school students in Chicago, USA, is now more than 464,800, and the total number of primary and secondary school students in New York City is now more than 1,018,800. According to the proportional number, the ratio should be 100 to 46, but the actual school expenses of the two cities are 100 to 34. The total annual salary of primary and secondary school teachers in New York is more than US$106 million, while the annual salary in Chicago is only more than US$36.7 million. This is because the salaries of teachers in the two cities are different, and the living standards in the two places are also different.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Budget and Recurring Expenses of Private New York University <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The total budget for private New York University this year is US$7,530,000, an increase of more than US$950,000 compared to last year, and an increase of 18 times compared to 1911. It is found that the school's expenses in that year were 420,000 yuan, which increased to 820,000 yuan in 1916, 1.78 million yuan in 1920, and 3.05 million yuan in 1925. This is the approximate increase in expenses in the past 20 years. Among them, the salaries of faculty and staff were 3.58 million yuan last year, and the new budget has increased to 4.02 million yuan. The expenses for scientific instruments and utensils and expenses are 500,000 yuan. The expenses for purchasing and binding books in the library are 75,000 yuan. The management and repair of school buildings are 900,000 yuan. The distribution of expenses is as follows: 1.8 million yuan for the College of Arts and Sciences, 1.02 million yuan for the College of Commerce, 770,000 yuan for the College of Engineering and Science, 890,000 yuan for the College of Education, 500,000 yuan for the College of Medicine, 410,000 yuan for the College of Dentistry, 250,000 yuan for the College of Law, 250,000 yuan for the Graduate School, and 200,000 yuan for the Summer School.</p>

<p>American newspapers reported that the American federal government's parliament has approved the case of education for the children of the Red Indians, who have struggled and improved their treatment over the years. Starting from July 1st of this year, the annual education fees for the children of the Red Indians will be increased by more than US$660,000 from the federal government. A standard will be formulated according to the minimum daily needs of each child's food and clothing specified by President Hoover, which is estimated to be US$0.378 per student per day for food and US$42.22 per student per year for clothing.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Schools' Receipts and Certificates Should Have Revenue Stamps Affixed <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, upon approval from the Ministry of Finance, issued a circular to national, specialized, and higher education institutions, as well as to provincial and municipal education departments, stating that all kinds of money receipts and certificates of completion and transfer should uniformly bear revenue stamps. It was noted that the Ministry of Finance had previously requested that all schools affix revenue stamps to all kinds of money receipts, which was published in the Ministry's Gazette, Volume 2, No. 8, and circulated for compliance. Now, the Ministry of Finance has again advised: "It has been found that various schools still do not uniformly affix revenue stamps to all kinds of money receipts as required. Furthermore, specialized schools and higher institutions' certificates of completion and transfer should each bear a revenue stamp of one dime, while middle schools and schools of equal standing should each bear a revenue stamp of four cents, as stipulated in the regulations. Many schools have not complied, resulting not only in losses to the national treasury but also hindering the inculcation of revenue stamp awareness and the development of widespread habits. It is requested that all schools be instructed to uniformly affix revenue stamps to all kinds of receipts and certificates as per regulations, to maintain the national treasury and comply with the law in its entirety." The Ministry, in addition to forwarding copies, urgently orders that the aforementioned departments instruct all schools to comply uniformly.</p>
<h3 id="e198">The Calamity of the Qixia Rural Normal School <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The Nanjing Middle School's Qixia Mountain Rural Normal School is one of the most renowned rural experimental normal schools in the country. The school's director, Huang Zhifu, has painstakingly managed it for years, achieving its current success. During this summer vacation, aside from Huang and a few staff members remaining at the school, there were also three students from distant places who stayed and did not return home. Unexpectedly, this has caused a major upheaval. Several days ago, the Capital Garrison Headquarters notified the Ministry of Education, stating that according to detective reports, students from several schools in the capital, including certain ones, were found to have communist elements within them, and requested that the affiliated schools be instructed to pay attention. The Qixia Rural Normal School was also on the list of schools to be watched. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Education informed Nanjing Middle School Principal Zhang Tong. Upon hearing this, Zhang made a mountain out of a molehill. In addition to immediately hiring Wu as the new director of the rural normal school, he also sent three staff members to Qixia on the 5th to take over from the rural normal school director, Huang. Huang had just received his renewal contract for the position of rural normal school director for the next academic year the day before. The sudden takeover was only permitted on the condition that it would be transferred after the handover was completed. Huang himself deeply knew that the teachers, staff, and students in the school were pure in their words and actions and that, apart from focusing on rural education research, they had never participated in external affairs. Now, encountering this unexpected blow, he was deeply shocked and bewildered. Therefore, yesterday morning (the 7th), he went to the Ministry of Education to meet with Vice Minister Zhu to inquire about the truth of the matter. It was reported that the Capital Garrison Headquarters' report was of a general nature and not specifically targeted at the Qixia Rural Normal School. Its intention was merely to hope that all schools would take precautions against possible troubles and did not carry any special meaning. The Ministry's notification to Principal Zhang was only to ask him to pay attention, not to instruct him to remove Director Huang. Moreover, the Ministry of Education has always highly praised Huang's performance in running the school over the years and would never use vague rumors to incriminate someone and endanger the protection of human rights in the education field. It was also heard that Zhang has rehired Huang as the director of the normal science department in the high school, but Huang believes that rural education is his lifelong career and hopes that the Qixia Rural Normal School will not be affected by his personal departure in the promotion of the rural normal school cause.</p>

Due to the narrowness of the original location on Maigen Road, which was insufficient for its needs, it has moved to the intersection of Gordon Road and Haifang Road, where the buildings are spacious and the air is good. It is now scheduled to hold new student entrance exams on the 20th of this month, and the number of people from near and far applying to the school is exceptionally large. It is reported that the school will also establish an affiliated complete elementary school starting next semester to expand its operations.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Public Tennis Doubles Final at 4 PM Today <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia vs. Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang</p>
<p>丨Yesterday's Semifinals丨 Kata and Yu Liu Fail. The Shanghai Chinese Open Tennis Doubles Semifinals were held at the Chinese Tennis Court yesterday afternoon starting at 2:30 PM. The audience was very enthusiastic and spirited. As a result, the Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia team and the Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang team won the right to compete in the final. The Lin-Zheng team defeated the Canavero and Tafels team by scores of 2-6, 6-4, and 6-4. The Qiu-Jiang team defeated the Yu Tianguang and Liu Keng team by scores of 6-2, 7-5, and 6-3. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e204">(1) Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 Defeat Canavero and Tafels <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The match between Lin-Zheng and Kata started at 2:30 PM. Lin Baohua arrived late and rushed onto the court, appearing quite flustered. The first set was lackluster and uneventful. Kata won easily with a score of 6-2. From then on, both sides fought harder and the competition became very intense, completely different from the first set. Zheng Zhaojia showed great skill and Lin Baohua's solid technique made it difficult for Kata to cope, exhausting them. As a result, they won three sets in a row and achieved the final victory. The referee was Xu Zhendong.</p>
<h3 id="e205">First Set... 2-6 <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Both sides were negligent at the start of the match, and there were no highlights. However, Canavero remained steady as always and did not diminish his performance. Lin Baohua served and attacked, but the opponent's counterattack was effective, winning the first game and boosting their morale slightly. Lin-Zheng suffered repeated setbacks and made many mistakes, losing four games in a row. They then quickly tried to catch up and scored two more games. However, bad luck struck, and they were unable to do as they wished. As a result, Canavero won the set with a score of 6-2. The referee made many oversights in this set. Tafels often jumped his foot when serving, gaining a lot of advantage, and only changed slightly after being warned by the referee.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Second Set... 6-4 <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>The situation became more intense starting from the second set. Lin-Zheng had good coordination and proper positioning, and were able to cope with ease. However, the opponent's strength did not seem to slacken. The first game victory still belonged to Kata. Subsequently, Tafels made great use of his wonderful shots. Although Lin Baohua smashed hard, all the shots were intercepted by Tafels. The ball was like cannon fire, making for a spectacular back-and-forth. Lin-Zheng won two consecutive games, and the opponent also scored a game, making the score 2-2. It then went to 3-3, with both sides holding their ground. Brilliant shots were frequently seen, eliciting cheers from the audience. The young hero Zheng Zhaojia repeatedly showed off his skills, cooperating effectively with his teacher Lin Baohua. Using either interceptions or smashes, he soon took the lead with a score of 5-2, creating a superior situation and winning this set with a score of 6-4.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Third Set... 6-4 <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>In this set, the competition between the two sides became more intense, with strict defenses and very few mistakes. The situation was tense and each side had its own achievements. Kata took the lead and repeatedly gained the upper hand. However, after the score was 2-2, Lin-Zheng suddenly took the lead with a score of 3-2. Kata did not fall behind and closely followed. After the score was 4-4, it was Lin Baohua's turn to serve, and he continuously landed four heavy, cannonball-like serves. The opponent was unable to resist, and they took the lead again with a score of 5-4. As a result, their momentum surged. At this critical moment, they were unwilling to let go, like hungry tigers pouncing on sheep, brave and extraordinary. In a few rounds, they won another game and won the third set with a score of 6-4.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Fourth Set... 6-4 <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>After a short break after the three sets, they lined up and fought again. Lin-Zheng, having taken the lead with a score of 2-1, would have achieved a complete victory if they had won one more set. However, Kata had to boost their spirits and fight to the death in this serious situation, hoping to reverse the situation and reach the fifth set final. Since the start of the battle, after Lin-Zheng had won the first game, the opponent used sharp interceptions to break Lin-Zheng's smashes, losing three consecutive games and taking the lead with a score of 3-1. Before long, it became 4-2, and Kata's momentum was fierce, with Lin-Zheng in a precarious situation. Then, they shook off their spirits and worked hard. Zheng Zhaojia served with great force, winning all four serves, and the situation slightly changed. The battle became more intense. Lin-Zheng continued to work hard and finally won again with a score of 6-4, securing the right to advance to the final.</p>

<p>(Right) Lin Baohua (Left) Zheng Zhaojia</p>
<p>(Right) Qiu Feihai (Left) Jiang Daozhang</p>
<h3 id="e210">(2) Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang 6-2, 7-5, 6-3 Defeat Yu Tianguang and Liu Keng <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>The match between Qiu-Jiang and Yu-Liu started at 5 PM. Yu-Liu was in a bad situation in the first set and was almost entirely controlled by Qiu-Jiang. Yu-Liu changed their strategy in the second set, guarding the side of the net and responding appropriately. The audience's spirits were greatly boosted at this point. Although they were ultimately defeated by Qiu-Jiang, it was indeed the most impressive set of the three. Yu-Liu still showed considerable effort in the third set, but because they were tightly pressed by Qiu-Jiang, they could not move as freely as in the second set. Therefore, they still suffered defeat. Qiu-Jiang won the right to compete in the final with a score of three to zero. The referee was Hu Lusheng.</p>
<h3 id="e211">First Set... 6-2 <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>At the start of the match, the veteran Qiu-Jiang was indeed extraordinary, playing with great verve. Yu-Liu looked flustered and made a big mess. Therefore, they lost the first four games without showing any sign of vitality. Fortunately, Yu-Liu each won a game when it was their turn to serve, allowing them to avoid a complete defeat and lose with a score of two to six.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Second Set... 7-5 <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Seeing that the skill levels of the two teams were significantly different, the audience's interest greatly decreased, and they entered a state of semi-sleep. Then, the young heroes Yu-Liu made a timely effort to strive for success, which was due to the change in strategy. At this time, the two were stationed at the side of the net, intercepting at every opportunity. The two veterans initially did not want to be too harsh, intending to use their losses to encourage the younger generation. Seeing the opponent's agile skills, they were also surprised. Looking back at the scoreboard, Yu-Liu had already taken the lead with a score of three to zero. Subsequently, Qiu-Jiang changed their tactics, and the situation immediately reversed. Before long, they took the lead with a score of five to three. Yu-Liu made a comeback, using the net to win and creating a five-to-five tie. However, they failed at the last moment, and Zheng-Jiang won with a score of seven to five.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Third Set... 6-3 <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>The atmosphere in the third set was tense, the situation was serious, and the future was bright for the two young tennis players. They took the lead in every attack, and the veteran Qiu-Jiang, although victory was in their grasp, faced them with full concentration and did not slack off. Yu-Liu initially took the lead with a score of one to zero. Qiu-Jiang tied it. Yu-Liu then took the lead twice with scores of two to one and three to two. After three to three, Qiu-Jiang fully demonstrated their abilities and soon won with a score of six to two. As a result, Qiu-Jiang won the right to compete in the final with a score of three to zero.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Championship Match... 4 PM Today <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Since Lin-Zheng and Qiu-Jiang won the right to compete in the final yesterday, they will determine the ultimate winner today at 4 PM to decide the championship. The location will still be the Chinese Tennis Court. The two sides are evenly matched with sufficient strength. A fierce battle is expected, which can be said to be an unprecedented event in the history of tennis in Shanghai. Moreover, a large silver cup has been donated by the Weixin Trust Company Limited. The name of the winner will be engraved on it and preserved for one year as a memento. The National Sports Association will award two small silver cups at this event.

<p>Japan and other countries did not protest the Hunan Incident</p>
<p>They only verbally asked for an explanation</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting met with Japanese Acting Minister Shighemitsu yesterday morning at the Foreign Affairs Discussion Meeting for about an hour and a half before Shighemitsu departed. Later, Finnish Chargé d'Affaires Wei Meiji visited to discuss the rescue of missionaries in Jiangxi Province. Wang told reporters yesterday that Shighemitsu discussed various incidents during his visit. Japan and other countries have not formally protested to the Foreign Ministry about the Changsha incident. They only verbally asked for an explanation. The government has not yet received detailed reports, so it has not been able to give any feedback to various countries. Regarding the Sino-Japanese Ningbo case, the Japanese side's claimed losses are too high and there is not enough evidence, so the investigation is still ongoing.</p>

<p>Not Forwarded by the Shanghai Office</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of reclaiming the French Concession's Municipal Council, the Foreign Ministry's Shanghai office denied yesterday that a note had been sent to the French Consul in Shanghai for forwarding to the French Ambassador.

<p>A telegram from Liuhe on the 9th stated: "Commander Xiong, Shanghai, our anti-rebellion forces on the Jinpu Railway line are working hard to kill the enemy. The enemy's corpses are strewn about north and south of Wenshui. The number of prisoners and spoils of war is evident in the previous telegrams. Since the right-wing army captured Tai'an at the hour of 5 PM on the day of Yu, they have continued to pursue. Over the past two days, all left, central, and right routes have advanced separately. After retreating from Tai'an, the enemy has fled to Jinan along the railway line, abandoning military supplies and equipment beyond count. Our right-wing army has approached Jinan. Our central army, after defeating the enemy at Gushan and Taoshan north of Feicheng, will also join forces at Jinan. The left-wing is also approaching its rear via Pingyin and Changqing. Looking at the progress of the armies in the past two days, Jinan can be taken at any moment, and the enemy's retreat on the Jiaoji Railway has been cut off. The main force is blocking its front, and the long river is blocking its rear. The enemy forces entering Shandong have become turtles in a jar, and the time to annihilate them is imminent. A telegram is sent to announce the victory. General Commander's Train Staff Office."</p>
<h3 id="e228">Hunanese in Shanghai Launch a Campaign to Save Hunan <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Fourteen Measures Decided at Yesterday's Meeting</p>
<p>Hunanese in Shanghai Hosted the Press Yesterday</p>
<p>Hunanese in Shanghai held a meeting at the Great China Hotel yesterday afternoon at 1 PM to discuss the Hunan incident. More than one hundred people attended. After two hours of discussion, fourteen measures were decided regarding the Hunan incident: (1) Request the authorities to quickly send elite troops to thoroughly suppress the bandit communists in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. (2) Punish He Jian, the Hunan Chairman who abandoned his post, and the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government Committee, etc. (3) Reorganize the Party and government organizations. (4) Investigate the situation of the burning, killing, and looting in Changsha and the damages in Pingliu. (5) Request the authorities and compatriots across the country to raise huge sums of money to relieve the refugees. (6) Request the establishment of refugee shelters in various places. (7) Restore mass organizations to directly combat communism. (8) Organize Party member volunteer teams. (9) Organize people's anti-communist self-defense corps. (10) Each of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi should station five divisions of troops to maintain law and order. (11) Resolutely restore political training in the army. (12) Eradicate corruption and build a clean government. (13) Publish anti-communist and save-Hunan publications, declarations, and circular telegrams. (14) Organize the Shanghai Hunanese Save-Hunan Association and send representatives to petition.</p>
<p>Moreover, yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, more than ten Hunanese refugee representatives, including Wei Jie Fu, hosted the press at the China Western Restaurant to report on the tragic situation of the communist bandits' disaster in Hunan. They criticized He Jian for his negligence in prevention beforehand and for abandoning his post without a fight after the incident. When Changsha had not yet fallen, he had told the people that he would vow to perish with the city and not to lightly believe in rumors and move their families. Unexpectedly, on the 27th, when the situation became tense, He's family was the first to flee, carrying as many as two hundred pieces of luggage. This threw Changsha into an irrecoverable abyss. How can this not be punished according to national law? It was said that there are about four thousand Hunanese refugees in Hankou, the most, and about several hundred in Shanghai. When they fled, they had nothing but the clothes on their backs and have been living with relatives and friends, experiencing much suffering. It is hoped that the media will provide assistance to promote the government to quickly find a way to thoroughly suppress the communist bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. The meeting adjourned at around 5 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Ministry of Transportation Announces Process of Preparing Facsimile Telegraph <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>The facsimile telegraph service between China and Germany has been declared a success. Yesterday, the Ministry of Transportation announced the process of preparing for this service to the outside world, stating that facsimile telegraph is one of the modern new industries. It transmits original documents without using codes for sending and receiving, and the procedures are quite complex. The well-known systems include the Belrds system in France, the Karaluss system in Germany, and the Arcours system in the United Kingdom and the United States. Their effectiveness is gradually increasing. For example, even though airplanes in the air can communicate with the ground via wireless telegraphy, the noise of the engine often disturbs the sound waves of the messages, making them difficult to receive. Therefore, facsimile telegraph machines are used for communication. Moreover, Chinese characters are numerous, and telegraph transmission requires translation into codes before sending and receiving. With this machine, translation can be avoided, and the original text can be sent directly, and the meaning of the received telegram can be immediately understood. Now that the number of aircraft in China is increasing daily, air communication urgently needs to be prepared. Furthermore, this machine is most convenient for transmitting Chinese characters. Therefore, in order to develop China's telecommunications and facilitate public communication, the Ministry has requested the French Long-Distance Telephone Company and Siemens to transport facsimile telegraph machines to China for trial communication. The French company uses long-distance telephone lines to transmit facsimile telegrams, while Siemens uses one-way wireless reception to receive facsimile telegrams from Germany. They have already been installed and tested. Recently, the American Wireless Radio Victory Combined Company also intends to transport its machines to China for testing. The Ministry will determine the method after each company completes its testing, based on the results. The general situation of the two companies' trials is described below: (1) Last July, the French Long-Distance Telephone Company installed wired facsimile telegraph machines in the Beijing and Shanghai translation bureaus using long-distance telephone lines. The machine was invented by the French engineer裴灵氏. In the past, it was tested in post offices in the Pingjin and Northeast areas. The communication method uses contact transmission. After writing with ink, the sender needs to apply powder before transmitting, which is a tedious procedure, and the results are mediocre. Now, the machine has been replaced with a photocell, i.e., a neon gas lamp, so no powder is required for transmission, which is more perfect than the old machine. Since its trial use, the results have been good. (2) The Siemens machine is the 卡魯祿斯氏 type, produced by the German Telefunken Wireless Telegraph Company. It uses wireless communication to communicate with the Berlin 腦思 radio station. Preparation began in March of this year, using the remaining house of the 小營 instructor as a testing site. The company specially dispatched engineer 卢克思氏 from Germany to China to install it. Because the transmitting machine requires huge power to send over long distances, and the cost is too high, it is not easy to complete at once. Therefore, a receiving machine was first set up, using a directional antenna to receive reports from Germany. This machine was installed in June and began testing on June 26. At that time, a test telegram sent by colleagues from the embassy in Germany was received, taking only four and a half minutes. A few days later, three telegrams from Director 雙 of the Ministry from Germany were received, and the handwriting was very clear. The transmission of wireless facsimile telegrams between Europe and Asia was declared a success.</p>

<p>If You See Destruction of the Railroad Tracks</p>
<p>Report Immediately and Arrest the Perpetrators</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received an order from the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, forwarded from the Ministry of Railways, stating that the military situation at the front is currently urgent, and that some reactionary elements are lurking behind the lines, secretly destroying railway tracks and hindering safe driving. In addition to issuing orders to all military and police units to strengthen protection, it is hereby ordered that all subordinates comply. The County Public Security Bureau received the order from the County Government and forwarded it to the bureau. Therefore, yesterday, the bureau has forwarded an order to each branch bureau to inform the public that if they see any bandits destroying the railroad tracks, they should immediately report and arrest them to maintain safety and security.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Social Affairs Bureau Asks Jianghai Customs to Strictly Investigate the Large-Scale Transport of Flour to the North <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>It is rumored that a certain foreign firm in this port has commissioned the Flour Exchange to purchase a large quantity of flour, which is about to be loaded onto ships and transported to the north. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, after receiving the report, believes that in this time of scarcity, flour is an essential commodity for regulating people's food supply. If grain is allowed to be supplied to the north, the people's food supply in this city will inevitably feel panic, and the market price may rise immediately. Moreover, the Ministry of Finance also has a prohibition on the export of rice and flour to the north. Therefore, it has sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs Supervision Office yesterday, asking it to strictly investigate to prevent smuggling.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Social Affairs Bureau Bans Rice Market "Net Settlement" <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau recently investigated that the shipping rice of the shipping companies has been sold in "net settlement" which is regarded as a disguised form of discount, and specially ordered Zhu Zixiang, chairman of the Rice Merchants Association, to ban it. The order is as follows: It is hereby ordered to investigate the matter. Previously, each rice shop in Nanshi pledged and was guaranteed by the chairman to apply for exemption from evaluation of the shipping rice. If the limited price is exceeded, heavy penalties will be imposed. The Bureau took into consideration the merchants' difficulties and temporarily approved it, and ordered the chairman to secretly investigate and report at any time, otherwise the penalty would be doubled. It is now found that the opening price of the shipping rice has reached 21 yuan, and commissions are posted outside the "net settlement" which is a disguised form of discount. The chairman's failure to prohibit it is inappropriate and should have been punished immediately, but he is given another pardon. The industry should be notified that there should be no more "net settlement" and other matters. If there is another violation, punishment will be imposed. It is also found that the rice market in Nanshi has recently been manipulated. If immediate correction is not made, the Bureau will have to take corresponding measures to prevent abuses and maintain the people's food supply. You are hereby informed.</p>

<p>Each Committee Member is Responsible for Conducting the Investigation</p>
<p>Recently, the arrival of foreign rice has been smooth, and the Rice Price Adjustment Committee has tried to transport and sell ordinary rice. As a result, the rice price has been maintained in its current state and has not seen a rise. However, although there are many arrivals, there is still a severe shortage of spot goods on the market, and the rice price has not been able to decline. This is indeed because someone is hoarding in the middle. After receiving reports from members of the Rice and Grain Special Committee of the Municipal People's Joint Association, the association has specially formulated several investigation methods and requested each member to be responsible for conducting them: (1) Investigate and advise rice stores along all roads to hang up rice and grain price signs, publicly displaying the prices of various rice varieties every day, and not to secretly mix in inferior goods or deduct the quantity; (2) Secretly investigate rice merchants hoarding rice and grain and privately mortgaging current funds to silver and money industries, waiting for the price to sell; (3) Secretly investigate rice merchants controlling rice and grain sources and manipulating rice prices; (4) Investigate rice merchants speculating and competing, buying and selling empty, and raising rice prices.</p>

It was decided to appoint Yu Qiaqing, Zhao Jinqing, Chu　　, Zheng Yanxi, Lin Kanghou and five committee members, together with two expert members, to formulate detailed solutions and recommend them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for adoption.</p>
<h3 id="e237">County Will Increase Housing Donations <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>To Offset Public Security Expenses</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government, due to the financial constraints of the county's public security expenses, found that the housing donations in each district were all set in the past, and the current market price of rent is different from the past. Therefore, it proposed a county administration meeting to resolve the housing donations investigation and adjustment to compensate. Now, County Magistrate Yan believes that although the public security expenses have a monthly subsidy of 1,800 yuan from the Municipal Government and the official police have been greatly reduced, the shortage is still huge. Therefore, after consulting the proposal, he issued an order to each district yesterday to cooperate with each public security bureau to quickly ascertain the housing donations of each household within its territory, and increase them uniformly within this month to offset the public security expenses.</p>

<p>Cotton crops account for 70% of the farmland in the Pudong area of Shanghai. There were slightly too many rainy days after planting this year, and only two or three rainy days during the moldy rain season. The weather cleared up quickly, and weeds in the fields could be weeded in time. The temperature was very high, and the cotton seedlings grew very quickly. According to the records of the Zhoupu Jiangsu Provincial Cotton 南汇 Branch Farm, the average daily growth of cotton plants in July was 1.8CM. The cotton fields were slightly damaged by the two typhoons on July 14 and 27 and 28, but there was no major problem. Recently, the buds on the cotton plants have been growing vigorously, and the green bells are accumulating. They can be spun into floss in mid-August. If the weather does not change unexpectedly after autumn, it is predicted that a bumper harvest of 150 jin per mu can be obtained.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Announcement from the Transportation Department Regarding the Approval of Rice Subsidies <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Limited to Two Months for the Time Being</p>
<p>The workers and craftsmen of the General Factory of the Shanghai-Ningbo and Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, whose monthly salary is below 50 yuan, nominated representatives Cai Jinhai and Tang Ziliang to request additional rice subsidies. The request has been approved by order. The announcement is recorded below. Announcement No. 3 from the Transportation Department of the Two-Roads Administration is for the purpose of announcing the matter. In accordance with the instructions of the Administration's No. 793, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Railways' No. 6919, the General Administration's No. 440, the road intends to ask for the discretion to give rice subsidies to the workers of the two roads. It is difficult to approve the request, but it is true that the current price of rice is high and the workers' monthly income is insufficient to support themselves. The Ministry, in order to take care of the workers, temporarily approves a monthly rice subsidy of one yuan for those whose monthly income is less than 30 yuan, limited to two months. The time will be based on the price of rice. Apart from the order, the stationmaster shall forward the announcement to all units for notification and implementation.

<h3 id="e242">New Equipment Added to Inland Water Plant <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Building a New Filtration Pool</p>
<p>Adding Electric Pumps</p>
<p>Investment of 500,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Among the water industry institutions operating in the city, the water supply of the Inland Water Company is the largest. The highest daily water supply in previous years was 18 million US gallons. The water plant is located on Bansongyuan Road in Nanshi, covering an area of 100 acres on the waterfront. The original water production equipment included two raw water pools, seven alum water pools, six slow sand filtration pools, seven rapid sand filtration pools, three clean water pools, and a pump room for inlet and outlet water. The scale was grand, but since its establishment 30 years ago, various equipment has inevitably become old and incomplete, affecting the water supply. This has long been criticized by the citizens of Nanshi. In recent years, under the supervision of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, the company has been determined to innovate, and the results have been remarkable. In the second half of the 18th year, the water pools and mechanical equipment were completely improved and six rapid filtration pools were added in accordance with the plan set by the Public Works Bureau. The filtration area is a total of 5,025 square feet, and the maximum water output is about 14 million Imperial gallons every 24 hours. The normal water output is about 12 million Imperial gallons. There are two concrete sedimentation pools with a total capacity of 1.8 million Imperial gallons. The longest flow time is about three and a half hours, and the shortest is about three hours. There is a water tower to store water for rinsing the sand and gravel in the rapid filtration pools, and its water tank capacity is 63,000 Imperial gallons. The layout of each part mostly uses the old pool site. It is planned to demolish the old slow sand pools Nos. 2 and 3 to rebuild the concrete sedimentation pools and transform the old raw water pool No. 2 into a new clean water pool. A new rapid filtration pool was rebuilt on its west end. Construction started on September 20 of last year and was originally scheduled to be completed in five months. However, it was extremely cold in winter and there was a lot of rain in spring. When the concrete pool was put into water for testing in early May of this year, the bottom of the old wall was leaking. The repairs took a lot of time. A reporter went to visit yesterday and saw that one of the concrete pools was already discharging water, and the sound of the clear stream pouring down was like a waterfall. It is said that this pool supplies 6 million gallons of water per day, accounting for about half of the total. Only because the remaining one has not yet been completed, the water cannot be diverted. The water in the new rapid filtration pool is still inevitably slightly muddy, but after chlorine gas disinfection, it is harmless to health. In the future, when all the old pools are completed, they will be shut down, and all the water from the concrete pool will be filtered through the new rapid filtration pool. The cleanliness of the water quality at that time will definitely be comparable to that of Zhabei. In addition, the new water pipes, water intake wells, and water intake and outlet engine rooms of the affiliated water pools are also under construction. The progress of the intake pipe can be buried. The river mud filled as soon as it was dug during the two recent typhoons, thus delaying the construction. The water intake well has been excavated. Both water intake and outlet machine rooms have been completed and are being installed. All the machinery is a new type of electric pump that can pump 48 million gallons of water every 24 hours. With this, it is really more than enough to cope with the current daily water consumption of about 12 million gallons. It seems that the 500,000 residents of Nanshi will soon be able to enjoy clean and abundant drinking water.</p>
<p>French Business Water and Electricity Strike Yesterday's News</p>
<h3 id="e243">Warning to the Manager <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>The French business water and electricity strike has been difficult to resolve for a long time. According to the person in charge of the union, the strike was purely caused by the capital side. However, the person in charge of the capital side is the manager孟梭郎. During the first mediation by Du Yuesheng, the workers immediately agreed to resume work, but when the team went to resume work, the manager suddenly closed the iron gate to indicate rejection. The second time, after Du Yuesheng and others tried their best to mediate, the workers still resumed work, but the manager made temporary changes and refused to let the new workers withdraw, causing the workers to be unable to resume work and prolonging the strike. Recently, the sound of mediation of the strike seems to have the hope of being resolved. However, the conditions promised by the manager to the workers have not been able to give the workers satisfaction, and he has proposed to dismiss a large number of workers. How can the workers accept it? Looking at the above, the right and wrong of this strike cannot be shirked by the manager孟梭郎. Recently, the union will issue a written warning.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Requesting Instructions from the Party Headquarters <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>The French Business Water and Electricity Union, in view of the fact that the strike has been difficult to resolve, specially convened the riot police yesterday to discuss various methods. As a result, five representatives, Zhang Qixiang, Zheng Ruisheng, Lu Guanhong, Yan Baoshu, and Wang Jun, were sent to the Party Headquarters at Jin at 2 pm yesterday to report the strike and request instructions for resolution. The secretary of the Civil Training Association received them and said that the association has recently telegraphed the central government for instructions on the French Water and Electricity Strike. When the reply is received, there will be a solution. He said that the Party Headquarters has paid special attention to the French Electricity Strike. Since the strike occurred, the Party Headquarters has always accommodated the opinions of the union and hopes that the workers will wait quietly for the solution and walk on the right track so that no accidents will occur.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Discussion Meeting <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>After the representatives saw that the Party Headquarters expressed its great assistance, they convened a discussion meeting of workers to report on the progress of the liaison with the Party Headquarters. Then, Chairman Xu A'mei reported the news of today and said that the association is now planning a plan in order to resolve the strike so as not to prolong it. It is said that the reason why this strike cannot be resolved quickly is entirely due to the manager's tough attitude and lack of sincerity in accepting mediation. The association should issue a written warning.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Advising Citizens <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>The union issued a letter of advice yesterday to the citizens of the French Concession not to pay electricity and water bills. The original text is as follows: To the citizens of the French Concession: The strike that has occurred in our union is entirely caused by the coercion of the French Business Water and Electricity Company. Mediators have repeatedly come forward to mediate, but the manager has no sincerity, which has led to the prolongation of the strike and will make more than a thousand of our entire strike fall into a desperate situation. The compatriots of all walks of life are indignant about this wolfish and poisonous intention. However, the residents of the French Concession use the electricity and tap water fees of the French business. This time, it is true that there is no one to collect the accounts due to the entire strike. We still hope that our beloved residents and citizens will embrace the purpose of helping each other and the spirit of loving each other, and do not pay the bills before the strike of our union is resolved in order to show assistance, so as to promote their awakening. All the workers and friends are very grateful.</p>

<p>The Support Association has recently paid great attention to the support matters of the association in terms of strength. Yesterday, the South Goods Industry Union has begun to follow the resolutions of the General Assembly of the City's Labor Industry to raise funds from shops, companies and factories in the Chinese community. It is said that the results are very good. Today, it plans to raise funds in the British and French Concessions, and then continue in the American Concession the day after tomorrow. The Pharmaceutical Industry Union has also decided to set off today to raise as much funds as possible from the unions and shops as a practical support for the strike of the French business water and electricity workers.</p>

<p>It is presented to the Civil Training Association for Strict Handling of the Disturbance of the Labor Movement and the Conspiracy of Misconduct. On the 7th of the month, Zhou Fusheng, Yuan Ziqing, Shen Quanfu, Wang Wenjie, Wu Qinsheng, Tang Zhihe and other six people were suspiciously spying around the left and right of the association. A secret report said that a reactionary group had gathered thousands of people in Longhua and hoped to come back to work at the union. The six people came to inquire about the news. The association immediately detained the six people on the spot. After inquiring about the situation, it was true. In addition to sending the six people to the Second District General Office of the Public Security Bureau in custody yesterday (8th), it is presented to the鈞Association for the Public Security Bureau to handle the matter strictly. Before the union's strike is resolved, it is hoped that it will not be released lightly so as to avoid accidents. Presented to the Municipal Party Headquarters, Civil Training Association.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Preparatory Committee of the Cigarette Industry Trade Union Federation <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Letter to Comrades of the Industry</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Cigarette Industry Trade Union Federation issued a letter to the comrades of the industry yesterday. The original text said: Dear comrades, the mission and wishes of the federation have been roughly stated in the founding declaration. However, the first and foremost thing is of course to prevent the aggression of imperialists, to remove the yoke on us, to soothe the wounds, to seek our future, and to actively do our joint, united revolutionary work. Although the Nanyang Changxing of the past belongs to the past, its image and state of decline are still worth our fear, and the Nanyang labor and capital are sleeping in the same bed with different dreams and cannot cooperate. Therefore, if we want to seek development, the federation believes that the good feelings between labor and capital in our cigarette industry must be heated up to the boiling point. This is also the main component contained in the mission of the federation. Only in this way can we unite, organize, and unify our will, and first create a powerful and complete buffer group, which is a necessary condition. Dear comrades, this is our glorious starting point, and it is also the creator of our new life. Everyone actively rises up and concentrates our strength. Everything can be solved easily. Our future will, of course, take into account the concrete industry and economic state of the country. On the other hand, our livelihood must at least be solved appropriately. Crying and hunger is directly our misfortune, but indirect capital is not a good phenomenon. Moreover, this matter is a production issue of the entire country. We firmly believe that our capital side will definitely be able to thoroughly realize and deeply understand, and have also considered that we will definitely be able to discuss it calmly and at length. Considering that the British and American tobacco factory workers have recently requested an increase in wages, the result is an increase of 15%, which is to meet the requirements of the level of life. Needless to say, the power generated by unity can overcome everything. This is also like telling us that unity and mutual assistance are the natural duties of mankind. If you abandon yourself, you are an out-of-date person who digs your own pit. Furthermore, the workers in the past were mostly accustomed to clamoring and were easily used. Now, in this time of national crisis, our workers should regard any reactionaries and communists as snakes and scorpions, take the party's ideas as their return, and take the association's will as their business. Strive to create a life that strives for the final glory for the country and fulfills the duties of the people. Dear comrades, everyone, let's work together with the association to complete all our expectations.</p>

<h3 id="e252">Petition from Brush and Ink Industry for Tax Exemption on Books and Documents <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>Letter from the Trade Association to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Brush and Ink Trade Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on August 6th, stating: "Respectfully, we note that the Ministry of Finance has issued instructions that brushes, inks, and paper are not solely limited to educational purposes and should be distinguished from purely educational materials. We believe that while schools may also teach Western learning, they invariably begin with Chinese. Since Chinese is the foundation, all citizens, whether farmers, laborers, merchants, students, or soldiers, begin their education by learning to read and write, using brushes and inks. Therefore, brushes and inks are essential for education. Fortunately, the government is promoting education, aiming to ensure that all 400 million people can read and write. Hence, it has exempted books related to the 5,000-year-old national essence from customs duties, intending to facilitate the free circulation of books nationwide. Books rely on text, and text relies on brushes and inks. Brushes and inks are indeed essential educational supplies. Currently, the promotion of domestic goods includes brushes and inks, and the revitalization of industry also encompasses them. Moreover, brushes and inks are used to explain the meaning of books and to copy them. Should their free circulation nationwide be impeded? Our association has repeatedly considered that the raw materials for books are paper. Paper is taxed at half the rate before it becomes a book, and books are tax-exempt. However, the raw materials needed for brushes and inks, such as wool, bamboo, weasel hair, rabbit skin, wooden boards, glue, borneol, and musk, are sourced from distant provinces and overseas. Within the country, they are subject to transit duties and consolidated taxes. At customs, they are subject to import and export duties, totaling over 20%. This is similar to the customs duties on paper, the raw material for books. While books are exempt from taxes, the raw materials for brushes and inks, which support education, should also be considered for exemption. Furthermore, after the materials are made into brushes and inks, their transport from Shanghai for export incurs significant customs duties, estimated at over 10% of their value. The double taxation has reached an extreme. Since 1927, the cost of brush and ink production, along with food and miscellaneous expenses, has doubled. Consequently, sales have been sluggish, with domestic and international sales totaling only around 500,000 yuan. The brush and ink business is declining daily. We believe that apart from public and private organizations and shops, schools are the primary consumers of brushes and inks. If the government could benefit students and alleviate the difficulties of merchants by exempting customs duties on brushes and inks, facilitating their unimpeded transport, not only would brush and ink merchants benefit, but the entire nation, which uses brushes and inks to study books and writing, would also be blessed. Our association estimates that brush and ink tax revenue, based on 10% of annual sales, amounts to about 50,000 yuan. Converted to customs taels, this is likely no more than 30,000 taels. The total annual customs revenue of Jianghai Customs is over 20 million taels. Exempting 30,000 taels for brushes and inks is like losing a hair from an ox or a grain from a granary. Therefore, we request that you consider the example of tax exemption for books and documents and exempt customs duties on brushes and inks, benefiting students and alleviating the difficulties of merchants. This is truly a matter of public convenience."</p>

<p>Yang Zicong's Desire for Comfort</p>
<p>The Traffic Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways issued a notice to all employees yesterday morning, stating: "According to instructions from the Administration Bureau, which were relayed from the General Affairs Department, the Chief Medical Officer of the two railways, Xie Yingrui, reported that Gu Puquan, a physician at the Beizhan Clinic in Shanghai, had reported that Yang Zicong, an accountant, had visited the clinic on June 27th complaining of headache, fever, and loss of appetite. The physician diagnosed the condition, provided treatment, and granted two days of sick leave for rest. On July 1st, Yang requested an extension of three days. The physician determined that the illness had not fully resolved and approved the extension. However, on July 4th, when the leave expired, Yang again requested an extension. The physician found that the illness had fully recovered and denied the request. Yang then became agitated and left in anger. On July 7th, Yang sent a certificate from the accounting department stating that he was too ill to get out of bed and requesting a home visit from a physician. The physician immediately visited Yang's home and found him not only not ill but in good spirits. When asked why he required a home visit despite not being ill, Yang claimed to feel unwell only at night and requested another week of leave. The physician, assuming this might be true, asked Yang to visit the clinic for a certificate. On July 10th, the accounting department sent another notice stating that Yang was too ill to get out of bed and requesting a home visit. The physician immediately visited and found Yang physically and mentally healthy, with no signs of illness. When Yang requested another week of leave, the physician refused, stating that he was not ill and should be hospitalized if he felt unwell at night. Yang said he was ill because he wanted comfort. Since he needed hospitalization, why was he requesting leave? The physician firmly refused the request and returned. The physician reported that Yang, having been denied leave, reported for duty on July 11th. It is clear that Yang Zicong intentionally feigned illness to obtain leave and make things difficult for the physician. Article 5 of the temporary regulations for sick leave for employees of the two railways states that if an employee is unable to visit the railway clinic or hospital due to illness, a physician may visit the home to issue a certificate. Yang, being able to move freely, feigned illness and requested a home visit, violating these regulations. It is respectfully requested that the Director issue an appropriate punishment to deter others."</p>
<p>The report stated: "Accountant Yang Zicong repeatedly feigned illness to request leave, intentionally violating regulations and neglecting duties. If not severely punished, others may follow suit, undermining discipline and railway operations. The Ministry of Railways has ordered that Yang be dismissed as a warning to others." Therefore, it is ordered that the accounting department comply and that all employees adhere to regulations, refraining from requesting leave without reason to avoid investigation.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese have accumulated substantial wealth, facilitating frequent remittances. To prevent the loss of financial rights, they must establish their own banks in their places of residence. Among the overseas Chinese banks, the most successful is the one in Manila, Philippines. The Chinese community there comprises over 100,000 people and manages about 70-80% of the city's business. According to recent surveys, there are three banks founded with purely Chinese capital: Zhongxing, Huaxing, and Minxing. Among these, Zhongxing Bank is the most developed. Key founders and directors include Huang Yizhu, Li Qingquan, Xue Minlao, Qiu Yunheng, and other prominent figures in the Chinese community. It is reported that the bank, due to its expanding business, has established branches in Shanghai and Xiamen, and its Vice-Chairman, Dr. Xue Minlao, will be stationed in the Shanghai branch to oversee operations. Dr. Xue, a senior member of the Chinese community and a Doctor of Law, is highly respected in the Philippines. His service to Zhongxing Bank is expected to lead to significant business development.</p>

<p>Following the Municipal Council's crackdown on pharmacies selling aphrodisiacs, which garnered some sympathy, the Police Commissioner received a letter from a concerned citizen, Zhang Linsheng, stating: "I am compelled to speak out because I see reports of the Zhongnan Pharmacy selling aphrodisiacs, but I doubt all such sales are being discovered. There are other locations where they are hidden. I am reporting the Shen Yehe Venereal Disease Clinic at 45 Qinghefang, Zhengfeng Street, Wuma Road. Shen Yehe claims to be a doctor but secretly</p>

<p>The abortion drugs he uses are all from Zhongnan Pharmacy. Some of these drugs cost only a few cents but are sold for tens or hundreds of yuan, with the profits shared. They disregard human life. Alas, many women have died as a result. If you doubt my words, look at the advertisements in the newspaper, such as</p>

<p>These are disguised advertisements. Such people are devoid of conscience, motivated only by profit, and treat human life like a game. If this continues, the harm will be unimaginable. I am speaking on behalf of the victims and implore you to investigate and punish them severely, not only to rid the female community of evil but also to benefit society as a whole. We would be grateful."</p>

Xu told Shen that his girlfriend was several months pregnant and could not give birth and asked if there was a secret method to end the pregnancy early. Shen,</p>

He stated that regardless of the stage of pregnancy, the fetus could be aborted with certainty. He showed off letters of thanks from various places, adding to his credibility. Finally, he instructed Xu to bring the girl the next morning for the procedure. The next morning, Xu and</p>

<p>One, named Li Ruiying, was pregnant, and the other was Li Abao. They paid a registration fee of $1.20. Shen Yehe personally examined Ruiying's pulse and placed a stethoscope on her abdomen. He then asked about the duration of the pregnancy. Xu said it was about three or four months. Shen shook his head and said that, based on his examination, the pregnancy was six months.

<p>The number of injections needed is determined by the number of months of the pregnancy. Five injections should be taken orally, and one should be inserted into the uterus, followed by surgery.

The prosecutor also attended. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, stated that the defendant was being prosecuted under Articles 30 and 308 of the Criminal Code and that the police had started the investigation on August 1st after receiving a letter from the outside. The arrest was made without a search warrant. Therefore, the police were not able to seize the drugs but had discovered items related to abortion in plain view.</p>

<p>It shows that the defendant has been doing this for a long time, he added. Today, Li Ruiying was unable to attend due to illness. If the case cannot be concluded today, a search warrant will have to be requested, to search the clinic thoroughly to potentially find abortion drugs and sent letters. Detective Xu reported the events. Judge Xu questioned the defendant, Shen Yehe, who claimed to be 25 years old and a doctor specializing in venereal diseases and internal medicine. He denied any experience in abortion. He stated that Xu came to the clinic and asked for help. He said he did know that "Animal Blood Essence" was a blood replenishing drug and approved it for those that seeked it. Since the court saw that the information had to deal with abortion, they made it clear that they would continue investigating, so the court ordered that Defendant was remanded to custody for further investigation.</p>

<p>Boat from Changsha to Hankou</p>
<p>A Charge of 900 Yuan Per Seat</p>
<p>The American Evening Post reports that the Swire Shipping Company's steamship Suiding departed Changsha as the city fell. Desperate to escape to Hankou, Changsha residents crowded onto the ship. The crew took the opportunity to overcharge passengers, demanding 300 yuan for a first-class cabin that normally costs 45 yuan from Changsha to Hankou. Similarly, they charged 900 yuan per seat in the captain's cabin and 200 yuan per seat in the crew's cabins. It is estimated that the 500 passengers paid at least 20,000 yuan in excessive fares. Most refugees emptied their pockets to pay, and when some begged to keep one yuan to buy food upon arrival in Hankou, the crew refused without pity. After arriving in Hankou, the ship left for an unknown destination. Its whereabouts have not been determined.</p>

<p>Butcher Turns to Butchering People</p>
<p>Motivated by Professional Jealousy</p>
<p>Butcher Zhu Ada and Wang Caibao had a long-standing feud due to competition in the same trade. Zhu was known for his violent temper and had often threatened Wang. Due to the summer heat and the cramped quarters of Wang's residence on Yuezhou Road, Wang moved outside to sleep on a mat in the alleyway. The previous night, Wang and his friend Zhu Shunbao were sleeping in the open air when, around 3:00 AM, Zhu Ada arrived with several accomplices, some carrying guns, others axes. At that time, the crescent moon and cool breeze were present, so Wang and Zhu were in deep slumber. Their dreams were shattered when Zhu Ada arrived and attacked them with axes. Wang was hit in the hands and feet, screaming in pain, and fell to the ground bleeding. Zhu Shunbao was terrified by the attack and threat and did not interfere. The attackers fled with their weapons. Nearby police, hearing reports from passersby, arrived and captured Zhu Ada. The injured Wang was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment, and Zhu Ada was taken to the Harbin Police Station for detention. However, Zhu suddenly developed cholera, a serious condition, and the police sent him to the hospital. Yesterday morning, only the witness, Zhu Shunbao, was brought to the Special District Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Dayin, explained the cause of the conflict. Both the victim and the attacker were in the hospital, so the case was adjourned.</p>

<p>Thanks to the Metering System</p>
<p>The American Evening Post reports that after the Shanghai Waterworks Company in the International Settlement was authorized by the Municipal Council to increase prices, rumors spread that the French Concession Water Company would also raise prices. This morning (the 9th), a reporter visited an official of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company, who claimed that these rumors were unfounded. The French Concession uses a metering system, so customers conserve water. Therefore, the current prices can be maintained unless the company's financial situation worsens significantly. Even if a price increase becomes necessary in the future, it will be minimal to avoid unnecessary hardship for the public. In their opinion, the Shanghai Waterworks Company could have avoided the 25% price increase if it had adopted a metering system years ago. Metering is the only effective way to eliminate waste.</p>

<p>Inaugural Meeting Today</p>
<p>Shanghai citizens Yu Hualong and Zhang Yichen, concerned about rising rents in the city, initiated the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Rental Dispute Mediation Committee. After several days of preparation, the inaugural meeting was held today at 2:00 PM at the Tianhou Temple Shuji School. Yesterday, a notice was issued stating: "We have found that land prices in Shanghai are increasing daily, and housing rents continue to rise. This makes it difficult for businesses to afford the rent and for workers to afford housing. In short, millions of Shanghai residents are slaves to a small number of landlords. If we can reduce housing costs, both employers and employees can improve their living conditions. However, landlords are insatiable, seeking to profit from tenants, renovating buildings, and raising rents. Those who are employed can barely afford the rent, but those who are unemployed face great hardship. The high cost of rent contributes to social instability and crime. We believe that we must intervene to prevent this situation from worsening. Therefore, we have initiated the Shanghai Municipal Rental Dispute Mediation Committee to seek a fair balance between rents and land prices. We invite you to join us in this effort to help millions of Shanghai residents. The inaugural meeting will be held at 2:00 PM on the 10th of this month at the Tianhou Temple Shuji School Auditorium. We hope you will attend and join us in this effort."</p>

<p>Today Inaugurates Maiden Voyage to Canada</p>
<p>The newly built Japanese Empress vessel of Changxing Company, having sailed from England for the first time, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. As the vessel's displacement is 39,000 tons, its length is 666 feet 5 inches, its width is 83 feet 5 inches, and its draft is even deeper, it was anchored at the Wusong mouth without entering the Huangpu River. The vessel's first arrival in Shanghai saw the company issue a large number of invitations to various circles to visit. Three small steamers were specially dispatched to welcome visitors at the Customs Wharf to board the vessel. At 2:00 PM, it left Shanghai, and at 3:30 PM, there were over a thousand people visiting the ship, including many Westerners. The vessel's construction is excellent, divided into seven decks with four types of passenger accommodations: first, second, third, and steerage. Inside the ship, there are gardens, swimming pools, smoking rooms, dining halls, grand lounges, dance halls, and more. The beauty of the arrangement is almost comparable to palace halls. The structure is made of granite paired with colored carvings. The floors are covered with colored rubber carpets. Radio, music, movies, and other facilities are all available. Upon entering the ship, passengers feel as if they are entering a grand hotel in a bustling city, without feeling the hardships of sea travel. The first-class cabins are very sophisticated, with double and single rooms, some attached with bathrooms. The ship also has a ticket office of the Canadian Railway Company to facilitate passengers' train connections. The vessel's speed is extremely high, usually capable of traveling over 21 nautical miles per hour. The engine is extremely powerful, using the latest type of fuel oil. With three smokestacks, it takes only twelve days to reach Vancouver from Shanghai, including stops in Japan. Crossing the Pacific to North America in a direct route would only take nine days. Yesterday, those who visited the vessel all expressed admiration, confirming it as the fastest and largest excellent mail steamer in the Pacific, worthy of the name "Empress." However, when tea and refreshments were served to the visitors after boarding the ship yesterday afternoon, the order was very chaotic, almost turning into a scramble for food. If guests could be entertained according to their status, it would be more universal and the spectacle would be slightly more organized, without the situation of Western guests receiving special treatment while many Chinese guests did not receive refreshments, as happened yesterday. This reporter returned by steamer.</p>

<p>Liu Jin, a Hunanese who served as a junior officer in the military, has been living in seclusion in Changsha since his retirement. He, along with his mother, sister-in-law, wife, children, and others, totaling nine people, are extremely impoverished. At the end of last month, the Communist Party ravaged Changsha, causing an unprecedented catastrophe. Liu, supporting the elderly and leading the young, fled with his family, enduring countless hardships before arriving at Pukou. His elderly mother died en route, and his elder sister-in-law committed suicide in Pukou. Beset by disasters, Liu sought help everywhere, but ultimately, due to being unfamiliar with the people and the place, his appeals went unanswered. In desperation, he attempted suicide by throwing himself into the Huangpu River. Fortunately, he was rescued and sent to the Water Police Station. A suicide note was found on his person, its words so mournful as to be unbearable to read. The original text was published in yesterday's newspaper. After questioning by the police station, it was learned that a fellow townsman, Liu Jusheng, runs the Liu Ju Ji Paper Shop at No. 44 Chungi Lane, Qipan Street, Shanghai. That evening, a detective accompanied Liu to search for him. Upon arriving at the shop, Liu was not present. A clerk, He Meisheng, came out and, upon learning the purpose, made excuses that the owner was away and declined to take responsibility for providing relief. Detective Cheng Yongnian and others, aware that Liu's younger sister-in-law, wife, and children, totaling six people, were still stranded in Pukou without anyone to provide for them, and that Liu was bearing a heavy burden, decided that abruptly releasing him would inevitably lead him to attempt suicide again due to lack of money to return to Pukou. Therefore, they immediately hired a car to send him to the Hunan Guild Relief Center at Xieqiao, where he was taken in and provided with funds to be sent back to Pukou for further planning.</p>

The wording was initially gentle, but gradually became intense, even threatening to use a gun if payment was not made, potentially leading to bloodshed. Ge ignored the threats. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, Ye brought a group of gangsters to Ge's home, forcing Ge to go to a "tea meeting" (a form of forced negotiation). Ge refused to go. The day before yesterday, Ye returned with an even more menacing demeanor. Ge, no longer considering their friendship, reported the matter to the police, who arrested Ye and detained him at the Xinzha Police Station overnight. Yesterday morning, he was brought to the Special District Court. Ge presented the letters from Ye as evidence, explaining the situation. Judge Sun questioned Ye, whose answers were evasive. He then ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for seven days for further investigation.</p>

<p>Zhang Yuting Identifies the Indian From Among The Crowd</p>
<p>Monk Singh Cannot Deny The Crime And Finally Confesses</p>
<p>On the fourth day of this month, Zhang Yuting, a detective from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's water patrol team, discovered that an Indian man named Monk Singh was carrying 302 restricted bullets near the Wanyu Wharf in the South City. He was immediately taken back to the team. After a preliminary trial by Chief Xu, the person and evidence were submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning and investigation. After the case occurred, the public security bureau of the public concession learned that the case was related to Indian. They immediately sent detective to the bureau to request that the Indian be brought back for interrogation. The bureau approved to let the Indian be taken away and later sent to the British Consulate General. It was heard that the British consul took the case seriously, so the court was opened some days ago to trial the case. The court first summoned more than twenty Indians to mix Monk Singh with them, make them to line up at the court and ordered the detective Zhang Yuting to identify Monk Singh. Many of the Indians were in the public gallery, so when Zhang was asked to identify Monk Singh in public, Zhang was able to identify Monk Singh. Zhang said that on the day he patrolled Wanyu Wharf, he saw an Indian Monk Singh carrying a red cloth package which looked suspicious so he went forward to check him out, but Monk Singh wanted to resist. Then he saw that he had a gun, so Monk Singh dare not to resist. When he checked his package, he found 302 bullets. Then Zhang brought Monk Singh back to the police team. Monk Singh’s initial testimony was denial, but after repeated questioning, he confessed that the bullets were being taken somewhere to be sold. He said that there was a man named A Si who lived in Qichang Zhai, Pudong. A Si runs a used goods business and sells bullets with him. The court sent Officer Ross and Zhang Yuting to Qichang Zhai to arrest A Si. However, A Si had already heard about this and ran away. It was found that Monk Singh had worked as a guard at the Jianghai Customs Ammunition Depot, resulting in the theft of over 20,000 bullets from the depot. Therefore, the bullets found were from the depot. At 10am of yesterday, the court was opened to trial the case. Monk Singh bowed his head and said nothing when he was asked questions. The court declared that there were solid evidences to prove that Monk Singh trafficked illegal goods and ordered that Monk Singh be detained and the verdict would be announced some day.</p>

<p>Yan Chen, an old woman from Suzhou who lived at No. 376 Changbang Road, had a daughter-in-law named Yan Wu, only 21 years old. She had been married for not long and had a son whom both the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law cherished. Unexpectedly, the son did not live long and died on the 27th of last month. One was heartbroken over the grandson, and the other felt a deep maternal love, crying incessantly. Wu was even more grief-stricken and developed thoughts of ending her life, exhibiting suicidal tendencies. Her mother-in-law gently dissuaded her, so she remained alive. At 6:00 AM the day before yesterday, Wu went out in tears. When her mother-in-law asked where she was going, she replied that she was going to the market to buy vegetables, so her mother-in-law did not suspect anything. However, Wu took the opportunity to purchase opium paste and returned home, secretly consuming it. Before long, the poison took effect, causing abdominal pain. Chen still thought it was indigestion and sent her to Baolong Hospital. The diagnosis was poisoning, and it was beyond salvation. She died at 8:00 AM. The Xinzha Police Station, upon receiving the report, dispatched detectives to carry the body to the forensic examination office on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo from the Special District Court arrived at the office to conduct the examination and ruled that Chen, her mother-in-law, should take the body back for burial.</p>

<p>Chen Huang Dies of Stomach Disease</p>
<p>Chen Huang, a young woman from Ningbo, was 24 years old. This spring, due to the poor living conditions in her hometown, she came to Shanghai intending to find work as a female worker. After a long time, she was introduced by a fellow townsman, Mr. A, to work as a servant in the Lin residence in Wusong, where she was considered diligent and frugal. However, she had a history of stomach problems that recurred intermittently, causing severe pain, insomnia, and vomiting. She suffered greatly. The day before yesterday, her old illness recurred, causing severe stomach pain. Upon hearing someone say that taking a small amount of opium could relieve the pain, she went to a certain place to purchase a few coins' worth of opium. Lacking a lamp and pipe, she swallowed the raw opium. Unexpectedly, within a few hours, the poison took effect, causing her to groan in bed. The employer immediately took her to the hospital twice for treatment, but the poison had entered her intestines, making it impossible to save her. She gradually died. The local police station has ordered a guarantor to report the matter to the local court for examination. One version states that she intentionally took the poison.</p>

<p>Xu Longsheng, a villager from the 30th Bao 3rd Tu of this county, has hired lawyer Chen Wenxiang to sue his wife, Xu Zhang, in the local court for insulting his elders and requesting a divorce. After repeated summonses, no resolution was reached, and he was instructed to reconcile outside of court. The day before yesterday, Judge Tong Shengli opened the court again to hear the case. As the witnesses were not complete, he was instructed to invite Yao Zixiang for a retrial. Yesterday morning, Judge Tong again opened the court. After both parties briefly presented their cases, the official ordered Yao Zixiang to be brought to the case to provide testimony. Yao Zixiang, age 34, farmer, stated: "I am the maternal uncle of the plaintiff. Xu Longsheng came to me to say that the husband and wife were quarreling, and I advised him to be more tolerant. I don't know the specifics." The interrogator understood the situation and invited Prosecutor Zhao to the court to present his opinion. The interrogator then ruled that the case's arguments were concluded and that the verdict would be announced on the 12th. He then adjourned the court.</p>

<p>Claims to Be Unloved by Husband for Being "Too Big"</p>
<p>A woman named Lu Fubao has filed a petition with the local court requesting the annulment of her marriage contract. The main points of her petition are that, due to having no one to rely on after her husband's death, she remarried Wu Caizhang through an introduction. A marriage contract was drawn up. However, after living together, Wu Caizhang pawned her clothes and jewelry and subjected her to abuse. The defendant, Wu Caizhang, also submitted a defense, stating that due to a lack of someone to take care of the household, he had only married the plaintiff on March 6th of this year through a matchmaker, paying a dowry of 200 yuan. Barely a month after she entered the home, he noticed that her actions were strange, often going out and not returning. He advised her to stay home, but she ignored him. Now she suddenly petitions for the annulment of the marriage contract. However, the defendant requests that the losses he has suffered not be compensated and that they continue living together. This case was publicly heard the day before yesterday without resolution, and was adjourned for further testimony. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Tong Shengli specially opened the eighth court for a retrial. Both the plaintiff, defendant, and the defendant's witnesses - Wu Chen (defendant's mother), Wang Wu (defendant's sister), Wang Erkang (defendant's brother-in-law, i.e., Wang Wu's husband) - and the plaintiff's lawyer, Chen Jinrong, all arrived at the court as summoned. First, Wang Erkang testified, stating that he was 28 years old, from Yuyao, residing at No. 39 Shengsheng Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, and working on the Ningbo train in Shanghai. "The defendant, Wu Caizhang, is my brother-in-law." (Question) "What kind of business does the defendant do, and how much does he earn per month?" (Answer) "He (referring to Wu Caizhang) works at a dance hall on Sichuan Road, earning a monthly salary of over 30 yuan." (Question) "How can he make ends meet with such a small salary?" (Answer) "My mother-in-law, Wu Chen, is supported by me. Moreover, he has income from small side jobs, which is enough to manage." (Question) "Do you know why they want to separate?" (Answer) "The defendant's business usually ends around 2:00 AM, after which he returns home. Now, because foreign sailors and others go there to have fun, he often has to stay until dawn to close up and go home. The plaintiff does not understand this and mistakenly suspects that the defendant has a lover or is smoking opium, which leads to arguments." Next, Wu Chen testified, stating that she was 55 years old, from Zhenhai, and currently living at her son-in-law's home. (Question) "Why don't you live with your son and daughter-in-law, but instead live with your son-in-law?" (Answer) "Because my son-in-law has no parents, I often live with him." (Question) "Are your son and daughter-in-law harmonious with each other?" (Answer) "They are harmonious." Wang Wu testified, stating that she was 19 years old. (Question) "Have you ever been to your brother's house?" (Answer) "No, I have never been there because I was sick after giving birth." (Question) "Can you mediate to prevent them from separating?" (Answer) "I cannot persuade them. I have tried to persuade them before, but they would not listen." Lu Fubao testified, requesting permission to dissolve the marriage contract. She also stated that after living with the defendant, she exchanged her gold bracelet for 57.40 yuan and pawned her pearl bracelet for 50 yuan, all to pay off the defendant's debts. She also pawned her pearl circle to buy a Western suit for the defendant. Initially, they treated me very well, but now that they see that my jewelry has been tricked away, the three of them (referring to the defendant and his mother and sister) are of one mind in abusing me. I really cannot bear the hardship." The official said, "You are not a child of three or two years old, it cannot be so easy." (Answer) "Everything is true. Moreover, the defendant has never liked big women." (Note: The plaintiff was wearing a short white summer cloth shirt with blue flower trim around the cuffs, trousers of roasted fragrance cloud gauze, flesh-colored silk stockings, and sky-blue flower satin shoes. She had short hair and a very obese body, but her appearance was quite good and her speech was eloquent. The defendant was wearing a white glued cloth Zhongshan suit.) The official ordered the defendant, Wu Caizhang, to be brought to the case and testified that he did not want to separate. The plaintiff's statements were all false. The official then invited Prosecutor Xu Heling to the court to express his opinion. After deliberation, he considered the arguments concluded and scheduled the sentencing for the 12th of this month.</p>

<p>Zhu Jinsheng and Sun Meiyu</p>
<p>Zhu Jinsheng, a bean and wheat merchant residing in Dou City Street in the South City, took a Suzhou woman named Sun Meiyu as his concubine several years ago. She was 35 years old. He rented a house for her in the South City and provided all expenses on a monthly basis. For several years, they lived in peace. Recently, however, Meiyu developed liver disease, which led to her smoking opium. As a result, her expenses increased significantly, and disagreements arose repeatedly over the use of money. Jinsheng, finding his repeated advice ineffective, filed a complaint with the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office, accusing Sun Meiyu of smoking opium. The court arrested Meiyu and sentenced her to a fine of 60 yuan and two months of detention. However, Meiyu appealed and requested to be released on bail. While Meiyu was in detention, Jinsheng went to Meiyu's room to collect all her belongings and found 19 pawn tickets, some for 160 yuan and others for over 10 yuan. After Meiyu was released on bail, she repeatedly negotiated with Jinsheng. After repeated mediation by friends of both parties, they agreed to sever their family relationship. The agreed conditions were: (1) Jinsheng would pay Meiyu 1,500 yuan as future living expenses; (2) all items in the room would be taken away by Meiyu; (3) all utensils in the parlor would belong to Jinsheng. After the above conditions were agreed upon, an agreement was drawn up at lawyer Jin Yu's office, proving that they would forever sever their family relationship. However, the court appeal was scheduled to be heard yesterday, and the plaintiff has requested permission to withdraw the self-accusation portion. The husband-concubine lawsuit has thus come to an end.</p>

<h3 id="e290">Flower Gambling in the French Concession Repeatedly Raided <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>The French police have recently been strictly cracking down on flower gambling in the concession. The day before yesterday, it was discovered that Wang Changsheng at No. 4 Xingchang Lane, Zilaihuo Street, Wang Zhang, a woman at No. 2 Ruifu Lane on the same street, and Wang A'er at No. 45 Yuxing Street, Xiaodongmen, were privately setting up flower gambling parlors to entice people to gamble, violating the prohibition. The police were ordered to raid the premises, confiscating flower gambling evidence and silver coins, and bring them to the police station. Yesterday, they were brought to court for investigation. First, the head of the police reported the situation to the court and presented the evidence. The defendants admitted to privately setting up flower gambling parlors, violating the prohibition. Chinese and Western officials sentenced the three defendants to a fine of 80 yuan each and confiscated the flower gambling documents for destruction. According to the French court's precedent, the first offense of flower gambling is punishable by a fine of 50 yuan.

<p>Lin Houzhen Detained for Two Weeks</p>
<p>Wang A'da, residing on the fourth floor of No. 8 Hongyun Lane, Huage Road in the French Concession, reported to the French police the day before yesterday that he had left home on business some days ago and that thieves had broken into his room and stolen twenty pieces of clothing. When the merchant returned home and learned of the theft, he knew that the stolen goods were in the home of Lin Houzhen, a Chinese police officer No. 388 who lives at No. 222 on the same road, and immediately went to demand them back. However, Lin arbitrarily demanded a bribe. The police chief, upon receiving the report, was furious that a police officer would dare to engage in such illegal activities. He immediately dismissed him and ordered detectives to arrest Lin and his relatives - Lin's wife, Jiang; and Lin's brother, Tiecai - and detain them, and to recover the stolen goods, which were missing five pieces of clothing. Yesterday, they were sent to the French court for investigation. First, the plaintiff complained about the theft and stated that he had already agreed to give a reward of 80 yuan, but the defendant refused, so he reported the matter to the police for investigation. Lin Houzhen testified that some days ago, a citizen was returning home when he passed the entrance of Hongyun Lane No. 8 and saw a thief carrying clothes trying to escape. When he saw the citizen coming, he abandoned the stolen goods and fled. At that time, the citizen asked if anyone knew who the clothes belonged to, but everyone said they didn't know, so the citizen temporarily took them home and informed the lane manager to let the owner know that they could come and retrieve them. Later, when the plaintiff came to retrieve them, the citizen was not at home and did not dare to demand a bribe. The rest of his testimony was evasive. Lin Jiang testified that some days ago, her husband brought a package of clothes home. When she asked where they came from, he said he had found them and told her to send them to Lin Tiecai for safekeeping. That was the truth. Lin Tiecai testified that the stolen goods were sent by his sister-in-law for safekeeping and that he did not know they were stolen. Judge Zhu sentenced Lin Houzhen to two weeks of detention as a warning and Lin Jiang and Lin Tiecai to seven days of detention with a one-year suspended sentence. The stolen goods were returned to the plaintiff.</p>

<p>Examination Confirms Death Due to Cerebral Anemia</p>
<p>Zhong Tiao, a Japanese national in Shanghai, runs a Japanese restaurant at No. 471 Zhaopu Road and employs a Chinese worker named Teng Fuming to assist with everything. Around 7:00 PM the day before yesterday, Teng rode a bicycle to deliver meals to a customer's home. After finishing the delivery, he rode his bicycle back to the restaurant. When he reached Wusong Road, he suddenly fell off the bicycle. He got up and tried to get back on, but he fell again and his face turned pale. He suddenly died. A rickshaw puller, Chen Bingyuan from Haimen, passed by and, seeing the situation, immediately reported it to the police. The police arrived and carried the deceased to the forensic examination office. Yesterday, Prosecutor Guo Wei of the Special District Court, along with a clerk and bailiffs, arrived to examine the body. According to the forensic examination, the deceased suffered from cerebral anemia, which could cause death in severe cases. Zhong Tiao stated that the deceased was delivering meals that day and that he did not know the cause of death. Prosecutor Guo asked if he could take care of the body on behalf of the family until his family arrived, but Zhong Tiao, disregarding the relationship between employer and worker, refused, saying that the family had been notified by telegram and would arrive in Shanghai today or tomorrow to claim the body. Helpless, Guo ordered that the body be temporarily kept at the forensic examination office. If his family had not arrived to claim the body by 2:00 PM that afternoon, it would be handed over to the Pushan Villa for safekeeping until the family claimed it.</p>

<p>Trafficked to Xiamen</p>
<p>Then Rescued to Shanghai</p>
<p>Gu Gendao, an eleven-year-old boy from Gaohang Township, Pudong, had a father named Fo Fo. His father passed away when he was seven, and his mother died when he was nine. Orphaned and alone, his uncle, a Buddhist monk named Lu Heshang, took pity on him and, out of familial kindness, took him in. Unexpectedly, Lu also passed away the following year (last year). Consequently, the aunt saw the boy as an omen of bad luck and mistreated him severely, often depriving him of food. Dissatisfied, one day she put Gu on the Donggou ferry to Shanghai, abandoning him on the Nanjing Road wharf. After purchasing her ticket, she returned on the same ferry. Friendless, Gu's cries were in vain. However, being resourceful, he wandered along the docks of Pudong, begging for food from Chinese and foreign merchant ships during the day, and sleeping on ships docked in Shanghai at night, becoming a dockside beggar (commonly known as "Xiao San"). His hardships are self-evident. When the Taikoo Company's Xiamen-bound "Nanchang" ship docked at the Taikoo Wharf overnight on its last trip to Shanghai, Gu, exhausted, was again sleeping on the ship. A certain Second Steward of the ship, seeing an opportunity to make a huge profit by luring young boys and girls to Xiamen for sale, saw Gu alone on the ship and conceived an illegal scheme. He lured Gu into a cabin and confined him. After the ship set sail, Xin Rongquan, the ship's oiling foreman, and his deputy, Luo Xingfa, discovered the plan and realized what the Second Steward was up to. However, being out at sea, they refrained from confronting him. They planned to hand over the Second Steward and Gu to the local police in Xiamen for investigation. Unexpectedly, before the ship docked in Xiamen, the Second Steward escaped alone on a sampan towards the mountains, evading punishment. Unable to do anything, Xin and Luo left the boy on the ship and returned to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, after arriving in Shanghai, Luo took Gu to the Water Police Station. After learning the details, the station telegraphed the General Women and Children's Relief Association, and investigator Lin was dispatched to take Gu into the association's care and education.</p>

<p>The host of the Zhejiang-Shaoxing Guild Hall in Houjia Bang, Lao Beimen (Old North Gate) of this city, has always loved growing lotuses. Every summer, the courtyards inside and outside the main hall (housing the Xuan Tan deity) of the guild hall are filled with lotus flowers. This year, two unusual lotus flowers bloomed, one bright red and the other snow-white. The red one lacks lotus seeds in its heart and has multiple layers of petals, called a "Thousand-Layer Lotus." The white one has lotus seeds in the center, but its petals differ from ordinary lotuses. The most remarkable thing is that ordinary lotus flowers drop their petals within one to four days of blooming, but these thousand-layer lotus flowers have been blooming for three weeks and remain fresh and lovely. As a result, many people have been visiting to admire them daily, and many have approached the host of the guild hall with cameras, seeking to photograph these lotus flowers.</p>

The French police, upon discovering this, considered Chen to have violated Article 293 of the Criminal Law for abusing an apprentice. Therefore, they dispatched detectives to arrest Chen and bring him to the French court for investigation yesterday. Wang Yinlin first complained to the court, stating that he had an argument with a fellow apprentice over a trivial matter. Chen, without investigating the situation, tied him up and beat him severely, demanding justice. Chen Xinbiao admitted that Wang Yinlin had quarreled with another apprentice, so he had slightly reprimanded him. His testimony was evasive. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Chen to three weeks of imprisonment as a warning.</p>

Its eastern mouth connects to the Huangpu River, passing through towns such as Tangwan, Beiqiao, and Maqiao. Transportation and irrigation depend on this river. In recent years, it has become increasingly silted, causing inconvenience to farmers, merchants, and industrialists. Therefore, dredging the river cannot be delayed. The associations in each district along the river have formed a dredging committee to raise funds. The proposed method of collecting funds from farmland was not approved by the county government. Now, the chairman of the committee, Yang Fulin, believing that this matter concerns the county's waterway transportation, has scheduled a meeting on the twelfth of this month to discuss funding solutions, hoping to resolve the issue. It is said that the estimated cost is approximately ten thousand yuan.</p>

Angered, the woman returned home and reported it to her father. Outraged, her father led four family members and gathered over ten neighbors, including Qian Jinfu, and confronted Guan severely. When they could not agree, they seized Guan and beat him severely, causing head and waist injuries with profuse bleeding. The patrol police arrived, arrested six men and women, and confiscated a cobbler's knife, taking them all to the Sixth District Police Station.

<h3 id="e310">Anecdotes of Mr. Sheng Shengfu <a href="#e310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Song Ju Shi</p>
<p>Mr. Sheng Shengfu Bingwei, a superintendent of education in Jiangxi and Sichuan, enjoyed a reputation for his accomplishments. After the revolution, he retired to the mountains and forests, maintaining a leisurely life for twenty years. Now, he has suddenly passed away. The passing of an elder statesman is deeply regrettable. My friend, whose relative is married to Mr. Sheng's son, knows much about Mr. Sheng's childhood and later life. Here are some of the highlights:</p>
<p>A Famous Teacher in Distress; A Successful Father's Rise. The father of Sheng Shengfu had meager savings from his business in the market, but he hoped his son would become famous, a sentiment rare in the world. He hired a famous scholar as a teacher and personally attended to the scholar's needs with great sincerity. The scholar was grateful for the hospitality and taught with all his heart. One day, the scholar took leave for some reason, and the young Sheng played truant. He had forgotten much of his lessons. The teacher, with a sincere desire to help, threw the teaching stick at Sheng, hitting him between the eyebrows. Sheng felt great pain and fainted. The scholar was deeply embarrassed and fled during the confusion. He met Sheng's father on the way, who was carrying a teapot and asked what had happened. The scholar was flustered and ashamed, unable to speak. Only after the father repeatedly insisted did he stammer and tell the whole story, weeping, "I have no face to meet my host now." The father, upon hearing this, looked relieved and urged the scholar to return, saying, "My son is unworthy and cannot listen to the teacher's instructions and fulfill his father's wishes. He should be punished. I will never hold any resentment." The scholar was touched by his sincerity and cried, promising to repay him. He agreed to return with him. From then on, Sheng, after enduring the pain, resolved to study diligently.</p>
<p>A Heroic Woman. Sheng passed the imperial examinations at a young age, earning a great reputation for his literary talent. The people in his hometown competed to choose him as their son-in-law. He married a daughter of a scholar named XX, who was bright-eyed and beautiful. The young couple was so deeply in love that they could not bear to be separated for even a moment. During the year when he was to take the imperial examinations in the capital, he returned home several times. His parents, seeing his infatuation, persuaded his wife to feign a quarrel to break his heart and strengthen his resolve. Sheng remained calm and wished to spend his life in the gentle embrace of his wife. The wife, unable to do otherwise, comforted him earnestly, "With your prime years, you should not abandon your ambition. I would be ashamed to be friends with a common man. Now that you have passed the exam and are starting on a journey of ten thousand miles, you should not be trapped by sentimental feelings. How can you fulfill the painstaking efforts of your parents who wish for their son's success? Strive hard and do not be reluctant to leave." Upon hearing this, Sheng shook off his sleeves and set off for the capital. In the gengchen year, he and Zhu Fuxuan from Haiyan and Huang Shao from Rui'an passed the palace examination and were admitted to the Hanlin Academy, known as the three famous scholars of eastern Zhejiang, admired by the literary world. This was based on the enlightenment of a famous teacher. When drinking water, we should remember the source. It was due to the father's respect for the teacher, but it was also due to the wife's influence.</p>
<h3 id="e311">News of Lightning Strike <a href="#e311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Xiao</p>
<p>Last month, there was a case of lightning striking a person to death during a storm in this city. A daughter died and her mother was injured. Superstitious people tried to combine the story, inventing a rumor that the daughter had evil intentions to harm her mother, so she was struck by lightning. Furthermore, since the mother did not see the tragedy of her daughter being struck by lightning, the thunder deity sent another bolt of lightning, suspending the mother in mid-air, so that she would not witness it. This far-fetched story has been published in various newspapers, and many people know about it. It is not necessary to repeat it. Now, let me tell you a more certain case of a lightning strike as retribution, so that those who invented the story of the mother being injured and the daughter dying may be shocked and speechless. The event took place in Yangxiang Town, Liyang. There were two Zhang brothers, Fukang and Fulin, who were farmers. Their family was wealthy, and the two brothers were very close. They had not yet divided the family property. Fukang had no heir, while Fulin had a son who was already twenty years old. Therefore, he was passive, but he never stopped yearning for an heir to the family. Last fall, his wife, Wang, miraculously became pregnant. Fukang was overjoyed, but Fulin's wife was very angry, worrying that if Wang had a son, her son would not be able to inherit the entire family property. When winter came, Fukang suddenly fell ill and died. Wang was grief-stricken, but she was happy that she had a child in her womb. However, Fulin's wife was relieved. Time passed quickly. In May of this year, Wang gave birth. Fulin's wife had long planned to poison her. She didn't call a midwife and volunteered to deliver the baby. If it was a girl, she would accept it, but if it was a boy, she would find a way to kill it. Wang was unaware and thought her sister-in-law cared for her. Unexpectedly, when the baby was born, it was a boy. Fulin's wife, without hesitation, ripped off the baby's genitals while Wang was asleep. The baby died and was buried in the suburbs. Wang was old and weak. She woke up the next day and thought everything was normal. Fulin's wife falsely claimed that the baby was born weak and died immediately. Wang didn't suspect anything and blamed herself for being unlucky. A month later, disaster struck. On the sixth day of the sixth month (the date may be incorrect), the weather was clear and people were suffering from the heat. Suddenly, the wind and clouds changed, and it rained heavily with thunder and lightning. Fulin's wife was struck by lightning and killed in the storm. Her death was gruesome. After the rain stopped, people from far and near came to see. Her entire body was charred and contracted. There seemed to be words on her back, but no one could recognize them. Everyone was amazed. Fulin was so frightened that he was pale. He thought it must be because his wife had murdered his brother's son and offended the gods. He was afraid that he would not be spared, so he confessed his wife's crime to reduce his guilt. The people then realized that the deceased must have done evil in her life, and they believed that there were gods. I have heard many stories of people being struck by lightning, but none have been as clear as this. Is there really a thunder deity? In reality, lightning is caused by the friction of electricity and air. The truth is clear. The old legend of the thunder deity is nonsense. Wang Chong of the Han Dynasty refuted its fallacy. There is a saying in Lunheng: "The image of thunder drawn by painters is like a series of drums. They also draw a person like a strong man, calling him the thunder god, with a drum in his left hand and a hammer in his right hand. The people believe it, and none doubt it." Even the false image of Fuyuan. Although the incident of the daughter's death and the mother's injury is not worth inventing, how could the death of Fulin's wife be so miraculous?</p>
<h3 id="e312">Little Experience on Taking the Train <a href="#e312" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c312" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">312</a></h3>
<p>— VB</p>
<p>If it is not early when you arrive at the station, after buying your ticket, you can go directly to the front carriage, where there must still be empty seats waiting for you. With the psychology of a traveler, everyone is greedy for convenience, and everyone likes to squeeze into the carriages at the back. They are unwilling to walk a few more steps to find a spacious place. If we know this trick, we will naturally not be afraid of not having a good place.</p>
<p>When taking the train, you should not be polite. Don't be afraid that the carriages are full of people. I should take a seat on other people with a fearless spirit. Those who are sleeping will naturally be restless and will have to get up and let me take it. If you ask politely and carefully for a long time, the result is that people ignore you and get bored.</p>
<p>Also, if you already have a seat, don't give it to others. Don't feel sorry for others who can't find a seat. If you give people a little space, they will take advantage of you. Even your own space will be squeezed out. This is practical experience.</p>
<p>You can't take the Shanghai-Nanjing night train now, because in this hot weather, everyone is greedy for coolness and has switched to taking the night train, so the night train is very crowded. There is not even a place to stand. There are fewer passengers on the day train. The quietest is the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou train at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. It is the most comfortable.</p>
<p>Buying newspapers on the train is twice as expensive as outside the station. If we are preparing to take a train far away, we can buy several copies of newspapers and cigarettes and food before entering the station.</p>
<p>The price of tea on the train now has an unwritten price. Regardless of the distance, Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou are two jiao and two fen for third class, four jiao or six jiao for second class, and one yuan for first class. The sleeping car is charged separately, about two yuan is enough. Also, the third class on the Jinpu Line does not have tea, so you must bring your own thermos. The price of tea in the first and second classes is about the same as on the Shanghai-Nanjing Line.</p>
<p>If the porters at the station carry things below Nanjing, they will still follow the station rules and charge a few cents per piece. If you arrive at the Nanjing station, the porters will charge you an indefinite amount. Three jiao is also one piece, two jiao is also one piece. Moreover, according to the porters' rules, even a small hatbox must be counted as one piece of luggage. The Jinpu Line is about the same. The porters in Tianjin and the dockworkers in Tianjin are very skilled at charging. They dare to ask you for one yuan to carry a piece of luggage from the shore to the ship. If you don't give him six or seven mao, you won't be able to leave. People who go out should know this.</p>

<p>— Qian Hua</p>
<p>(24) The Ryuta Maru's Return Voyage</p>
<p>The three most popular things in modern Japanese society are: firstly, mahjong; secondly, Chinese cuisine; and thirdly, dancing. The most famous Chinese restaurants in Tokyo include a few establishments such as the China First Building, the Beijing Pavilion, and the Shanghai Pavilion. The China First Building, specializing in Cantonese cuisine, has been established for decades and enjoys an excellent reputation. It has built its own five-story building with painted rafters and carved beams, decorated in an extremely luxurious manner, resembling a palace in Beijing. Ordinary swallow's nest dishes range from 35 to 60 Japanese yen per table. Japanese people often use Chinese cuisine for grand banquets, and women, in particular, consider it an honor to taste its flavors. The initial capital of the China First Building was only a few hundred yen, but it has now accumulated to hundreds of thousands. The restaurant business definitely occupies a considerable position among overseas Chinese. Mahjong became popular two years ago and has flourished especially this summer. The mahjong tiles are all imported from China, exquisitely carved, and sell for 30 to 40 Japanese yen per set in Japan. There are over a thousand mahjong clubs in Tokyo, each with several exquisitely decorated small rooms serving as mahjong parlors. After joining a game, each player pays one Japanese yen per four rounds, using chips to count wins and losses, not money. Its nature is entirely a game, distinct from gambling. As for the fee distribution method, the biggest loser pays six "jiao" (tenths of a yen), followed by three "jiao," then two "jiao," and the biggest winner plays for free. The clubs provide some fruit and refreshments for the guests, so the clubs' earnings are actually minimal. The owner's purpose is not to make petty profits but to gather like-minded individuals to study. Chinese students often go to the mahjong clubs with four or five friends on weekends and holidays for mahjong battles, still secretly calculating wins and losses in money. This trend has recently spread to upper-middle-class Japanese families as well, with significant sums changing hands in a mahjong game. Japanese people devote great effort to mahjong research, using scientific methods to create various strategies, with multiple mahjong magazines as the crystallization of their research. Society also distinguishes mahjong skill levels into nine grades, similar to the grading system in Go, with the first grade being the most basic and the ninth grade being the highest. Even mahjong terminology is now being changed to use Chinese pronunciation. It is predicted that after a few more years of research by the Japanese, they may be able to compete with Chinese mahjong masters. After the closing ceremony of the Games, the reporter originally planned to do some sightseeing in famous Japanese scenic spots, but because the Nippon Yusen Kaisha's newly built giant ship, the Ryuta Maru, happened to be sailing from Kobe to Shanghai on June 4th, this was a rare maiden voyage opportunity. Moreover, the Chinese athletes' delegation was also returning home on the same ship, so I wouldn't feel lonely during the journey. Thus, I left Tokyo hurriedly on the evening of June 3rd and arrived in Kobe on the morning of the 4th, immediately boarding the ship to rest. Zeng Junyanhua came to bid farewell. After spending ten days together, we parted ways, and I couldn't help but feel melancholy. At exactly 12 noon, the Ryuta Maru cast off from the port. The Ryuta Maru, with a displacement of over 10,000 tons, is perfectly equipped and even better than the Shanghai Maru. The journey was smooth and the sailing was extremely comfortable. I repeatedly met and talked with Zhang Boling, Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou, and others. Zhao said that the Japanese people's construction capabilities are indeed admirable, but they imitate Europe and America in everything, which feels excessive. For example, if someone can eat two bowls of rice, they insist on eating three, which leads to indigestion and is detrimental to health. Japan's current situation is similar, while our country suffers from being either excessive or insufficient, both being detrimental, he said. I also discussed the issue of Japanese women cutting their hair with Japanese friends on the ship. Japan imitates Europe and America in everything else, but it uniquely resists the worldwide trend of women cutting their hair. During my twenty days in Tokyo, I only saw a dozen or so women with short hair on the streets, which is quite remarkable. It is said that Japanese society spares no effort in maintaining the old morality of women, so even with the development of women's professions today and the ability of women to live independently, women's rights have made no progress. Preserving hair is one way to maintain the old morality, and they vigorously promote the beauty of long hair while attacking women who cut their hair, even regarding them as being on par with prostitutes. Thus, among Japanese women, you can hardly find one or two out of a hundred who cut their hair. Due to financial reasons, most of the athletes' delegation stayed in third-class cabins, but they ate meals from the second-class menu. Returning home after defeat, they no longer had the courage they once possessed. On the morning of the 6th, at 10 am, amidst the sound of firecrackers, we safely arrived at the Waibaidu Bridge wharf. The reporter's rambling notes also come to an end. I sincerely tell our Chinese athletes that failure is the mother of success, and we should encourage ourselves even more and continue to work hard. We will see the flag of the Republic of China flying high in the tenth Games, achieving great victories in all fields.</p>

<p>Gold Market Continues to Decline</p>
<h3 id="e315">Fluctuations Not Large, Continuing to Show Weakness <a href="#e315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market continued its sluggish trend, but the movement was moderate, with only minor ups and downs of three to two taels. The exchange rate was tight, with banks slightly taking in, and brokers uncertain about supply and demand. Firms like Hengxing, Zhifengyong, and Yong were eager to buy, while Yifengyong, Taikangrun, and others were selling. Large bars remained unchanged, with more sellers appearing each day. The opening price was low, but Hengxing and others scrambled to buy, pushing the price up to the 80 tael mark. However, when the exchange rate eased at noon, firms were inclined to sell, and the price was pushed down by two or three taels. Disappointing results led to weakening sentiment. The final price was 77 taels plus some change.</p>
<h3 id="e316">Market Trend Unsatisfactory, Declining by 2.6 Taels <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>The opening price was slightly down by one "qian" (hundredth of a tael) at 570 taels. The raw market's fluctuations were uncertain, varying by two taels. Initially, it was 78 taels, then rose to 79 taels and 7 "qian." However, Taikangrun and others were eager to sell, causing it to fall to 77 taels and 4 "qian." The exchange rate was flat. The September U.S. dollar and silver were mutually traded at 37.9375 yuan. When the shilling price was announced, Zhifengyong and others bought in, so the listed price was 79 taels and 1 "qian." The domestic market stabilized. Maijia Li bought September U.S. dollars at 38 yuan, and industry bought forward contracts at 38.3125 yuan. Hengxing and others followed, adding 1 tael and some change, totaling 80.03 taels. However, sellers persisted, making it difficult to support the price. After 10 o'clock, it fell to 77.67 taels. Later, China Bank absorbed September British pounds at 6 pence 6875 to 75, and various firms slightly supplemented their positions, raising it by two taels. After 11 o'clock, it totaled 80 taels. Then Taichang, Taikangrun, Fuchang, and others collectively sold, and the price weakened again, fluctuating by one tael. Until 11:50, it had fallen by three taels, suddenly becoming 77 taels. The forward shilling could be settled at 6 pence 6875. At the noon close, it was 77.5 taels, down 1.6 "qian" compared to the previous day.</p>

Xiangyu, Taikangrun, Yifengyong, Tongfengyong Fuxingyong all sold out.

<p>Yesterday, due to the weekend, the foreign exchange market was only open for half a day in the morning. HSBC's listed price had not changed for several days, as the large bar silver also showed no changes. As for the transaction prices among banks, the British, American, and Japanese exchanges were initially stable but then showed signs of easing, mainly because the gold market had already weakened. At the noon close, compared to the previous day, the British pound rose by 0.0625, while the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen decreased. Chinese merchants were calm and did not engage in large-scale buying and selling, only following the fluctuating gold market, which made people uncertain. Several tens of thousands of British pounds were sold, with Zhejiang Industrial and Taiwan slightly absorbing them. Banks also traded several tens of thousands of pounds among themselves. About 200,000 yuan worth of U.S. dollars were sold by the gold industry, with Maijia Li and Zhejiang buying generously. The Japanese yen was very sluggish, and arbitrage trading was quiet.</p>

The number of remittance drafts was slightly higher in the morning market, totaling 1.78 million, but less than one-third of that in the noon market, at only 596,000.

<h3 id="e325">Securities and Bond Prices Fluctuate Irregularly <a href="#e325" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c325" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">325</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the spot market for various public bonds was quiet, the futures market was still lively. The fluctuations in various bonds were due to the large rebound in recent days, and sellers were selling heavily, resulting in fluctuating bond prices and a confusing trend. The opening trend was still firm, but then the selling pressure caused a sharp decline. Bonds like the Reorganization Surtax and Disbandment Reduction fell significantly compared to the previous day. Later in the market, buyers seemed to be more dominant, and bonds like the Disbandment Reduction rebounded. The result was that only the Customs Surtax futures fell by one yuan and several jiao compared to the previous day, and the Reorganization Surtax also fell slightly by seven or eight jiao. Other bonds showed mixed gains and losses, with the amounts being small. The Customs Surtax spot market had been inactive for a long time. Yesterday's price rose by as much as five yuan and six jiao compared to the beginning of the week. The total spot market transaction volume was only 10,000 yuan, while the futures market reached over 12.1 million yuan, with Disbandment accounting for 3.61 million, Customs Surtax for 3.4 million, Disbandment Reduction for 2.6 million, Reorganization Surtax for 1.6 million, and other bonds remaining quiet.</p>

<h3 id="e326">Yarn Market Weakened Due to Multiple Blows <a href="#e326" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c326" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">326</a></h3>
<p>No Significant Impact on Actual Sales</p>
<p>The decline in the yarn market was due to a consistent sharp drop in overseas cotton yarn markets, leading to weakened sentiment. However, actual sales were not significantly impacted. The Guangdong brokers were still strong, and the Niuzhuang brokers were also active, so the market could still maintain its current state temporarily. The situation was still stable, but some, seeing the unfavorable global situation, slightly sold short. The yarn market is currently relatively strong due to good demand for existing yarn and is unlikely to experience a sharp fall. The future is unpredictable.</p>
<h3 id="e327">Moderate Decline in Man-Made Fiber Market <a href="#e327" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c327" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">327</a></h3>
<p>The man-made fiber market opened lower in the morning, following the decline in overseas cotton, and sentiment was fearful, with long positions closing out. The price for each month fell by eight or nine "qian" to one tael. In the afternoon, hearing that actual sales were good, the market slightly stabilized, and the price for each month fell by two or three "qian." The total transaction volume for the day was 16,050 bales. Shenxin sold the most at 2,200 bales, followed by Lichang at 1,000 bales. Gongtai, Yu Kang, Shenchang, Hengyi, Dachang, Chengtian, Changmao, Shenji, and Yuantai Changfeng sold between 350 bales and 1,500 bales. Yiyu bought the most at 1,150 bales, followed by Heshen, Yu Da, Daji, Taisheng, Kang Hanfeng, Xiesheng, Tianlong, Yongfeng, and Senkang, selling between 350 bales and 1,200 bales. The closing prices for the man-made fiber market are recorded below:</p>

<p>The sales of existing yarn remained strong. The total amount of spot and futures bought by various groups for the day was 3,435 bales, with 75 bales bought by counterparts. The market fell by five "qian." The Niuzhuang group bought the most at 915 bales, followed by Guangdong at 880 bales, the interior at 325 bales, Xuzhou at 170 bales, Shantou at 510 bales, Sichuan at 40 bales, Wuhu at 45 bales, Yunnan at 120 bales, Tianjin at 355 bales, and miscellaneous groups at 80 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e329">Cotton Market Plunged by Six "Qian" <a href="#e329" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c329" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">329</a></h3>
<p>Devastated by Sharp Fall in American Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton market plunged because the American cotton government's estimates favored short positions, and the price fell by more than 60 pounds, which was unexpected by most people. Furthermore, the sharp rise in long positions the day before had led to expectations of rising American cotton prices, but the opposite happened, resulting in a more violent reaction. Selling pressure was significant, and the market was in a state of great panic. Retail investors and the Ningbo group closed out their long positions, and sellers took the opportunity to exert downward pressure. If American cotton production is over 14 million bales, the price of 12 cents is difficult to maintain. The world cotton industry is declining, and consumption has decreased sharply. 1.4 million bales from last year have not yet been sold off, so Japanese merchants have long been aiming for 11 cents. However, the local cotton market can still be temporarily stabilized due to various tightening measures.</p>
<h3 id="e330">Many Long Positions in the Domestic Cotton Market <a href="#e330" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c330" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">330</a></h3>
<p>The domestic cotton market opened lower in the morning, following the sharp fall in American cotton, and selling pressure increased, causing the market to decline. Many long positions closed out, falling by five "qian" each. In the afternoon, due to reports that American cotton had received rain, Ruida liquidated its holdings from the previous day, selling 14,000 bales, causing each contract month to fall by another one "qian." The total transaction volume for the day was 75,400 bales. Meiji sold the most at 10,500 bales, followed by Maoji at 9,800 bales, Ruida at 14,000 bales, Yu Da, Gongtai, Shenchang, Yongfeng, Yicheng, and Daji at between 2,500 and 1,100 bales. Yichang bought the most at 4,900 bales, followed by Yiyu at 3,500 bales, Dachang, Chengtail, Xingda, Daji, Yuan Da, Taichang, Yu Chang, Dafu, Hengyi, and Tianchang at between 2,700 and 1,100 bales. The closing prices for the domestic cotton market are recorded below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to a government report favoring sellers. Later, due to weakness in Wall Street and long position liquidations, the market weakened further. Futures fell by 62 to 68 points, and spot prices fell by 60 points. British cotton futures fell by 29 to 31 points, and spot prices rose by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. Indian cotton market closed. The original telegraph is recorded below (August 8th telegram):</p>

<p>Unfavorable Weather… New Cotton Marketed More Smoothly… Demand Not Strong</p>
<p>New York, 8th—A telegram reports on the cotton market conditions for the past week, stating that before the government's cotton production estimate was released today, market prices soared due to prolonged drought and heat in the central and western cotton belts. After the government report was released, sentiment became uncertain as the estimated cotton production differed greatly from private reports. Without this report, the buying trend would have been even stronger. After the rise in grain prices, there was some cotton purchasing in the west, and banks have paid more attention to various commodities, including cotton, than before. Some sources say that timely rainfall can help cotton crops, but if the drought continues for another half month, the important cotton-growing areas in the central and western regions will have no hope of recovery. Unfavorable weather in August should stimulate active demand among traders, as it is heard that traders have not made sufficient advance preparations for the cotton they will need this season, as they did in the past.</p>
<p>Another report says the government's cotton production report was higher than expected, which is seen as favorable for shorts. New cotton is being marketed more smoothly, but demand is not strong. The situation in the spinning and cotton goods industries remains poor. It is heard that there has been some rain in several places in the southwest. Weekend statistics are as follows (unit: thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Yesterday, the supply from inland areas was very scarce, but sales in this area were extremely sluggish. The North Japonica market is increasingly weak because the factory and warehouse stocks are eager to sell Japonica rice, and the prices in the inland market are also trending downward. New goods are becoming increasingly available on the market, so sentiment in this area is quite soft and buying interest is very weak. Prices for high-grade, mid-grade, and low-grade rice have all fallen by 30 to 40 cents, totaling a drop of about one yuan in the past three days. However, the price of top-grade Japonica rice remains at 21 yuan. East New Japonica rice has also fallen by half a yuan, with an opening price of 20 yuan. The market outlook appears weak and thin. Stocks of late-season rice are still scarce, and there is no clear standard for the market. Sales are slow and changing, and the market trend is weakening, with transactions limited to small amounts. The situation in all sectors of the market was consistently poor throughout the day, and the overall trend may be downward.</p>
<h3 id="e338">South Shanghai <a href="#e338" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c338" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">338</a></h3>
<p>Very few boats arrived from the river bottoms, and sales were flat. High-priced Changshu and Wuxi machine-milled Japonica rice was rare, and medium-grade rice was also not abundant. The market was slightly weak, by a few cents. The situation in the Suzhou and Tongzhou Japonica rice market was similar, with flat and weak prices, and sellers had no possibility of raising prices. At a time when the market is declining, how could prices rise? However, fresh goods are in better demand because they are more palatable to buyers, so prices are stable. The market for late-season early rice is quiet. The price of new Japonica rice is still the same as in the Zhabei market, opening at 20 yuan. The state of sales for both white and glutinous rice is unremarkable.</p>
<h3 id="e339">Soybean Market Sentiment is Firm and Stable <a href="#e339" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c339" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">339</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the soybean market has been quite firm. Shipments from Dalian have been scarce. Only new soybeans from Jiujiang have been arriving continuously. Both sales in this area and purchases by customer groups are focused on high-quality goods. The market sentiment for medium-grade and lower-quality soybeans is dull, and there is a strong tendency to raise prices for higher grades. Yesterday, 4,300 packages of Jiujiang Jiqing City and other goods opened at a high price of 5 taels and 6 qian.</p>

<p>Small Broken Rice Rises Alone by 10 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice continued to show signs of activity, with inland brokers taking over 3,000 bags. Brokers from Hubei Province were also inquiring about small broken rice for rural villages, and prices immediately rose by 10 cents. Although the prices of other types of rice did not rise, they felt more active compared to the sluggishness of the previous days. The total market opened with over 2,000 bags of small broken rice at a price of 14 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen, 1,000 bags of large broken rice at 13 yuan and 7 jiao and 13 yuan per bag, and 200 bags of Min Dang rice at a price of 15 yuan and 5 fen. 500 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice were priced at 17 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen, and 400 bags of No. 2 rice were priced at 13 yuan and 8 jiao. 100 bags of Cover rice were priced at 14 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen, and 1,000 bags of Xu Ye Place brown rice were priced at 13 yuan and 5 jiao. 500 bags of small broken brown rice were priced at 11 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen. Brown rice and large broken rice were more active because they were being taken by inland brokers.</p>
<h3 id="e341">Reasons for the Decline in Flour Prices <a href="#e341" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c341" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">341</a></h3>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday, prices for all near and distant months fell consistently. The main reason is that actual sales have been hampered by bans and foreign flour. Customer groups dare not inquire, and hoarders have no intention of inquiring because rice prices are flat and the new rice harvest is approaching. Moreover, the price of foreign flour has fallen, and smaller factories are secretly selling off their stocks, all of which are sufficient to realize the decline in the flour market. In the afternoon, there were slight improvements as some customers inquired, but in the end, this month still fell by 25 cents, September by 75 cents, October and November were unchanged, December fell by 1 cent, and January fell by 75 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e342">Futures Wheat Comes Out of the Cage and Immediately Drops by 20 to 30 Cents <a href="#e342" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c342" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">342</a></h3>
<p>Spot Market Appetite Turns Sluggish… More Arriving Than Being Consumed</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the futures wheat market opened, it was rumored that foreign flour would be discounted and a large number of Japanese and American flour shipments would arrive in China, causing the market to become flooded and prices to immediately fall by 20 to 30 cents. Although the rumor of foreign flour arriving in China could not be confirmed for Shanghai or Tianjin, the actual sales of flour were sluggish, and factories' appetite for wheat waned. The futures wheat market was ultimately unable to recover. As a result, this month fell by 2 cents, September and November fell by 1 cent, October was unchanged, and December and January each fell by 2 cents. The spot wheat market appetite turned sluggish, and more wheat was arriving than being consumed. Owners reduced prices to sell off their stocks, with 5,000 bags offered at an opening price of 4 taels and 9 qian and 7 fen for old cart wheat, 4 taels and 9 qian and 2 fen for new cart wheat, 4 taels and 6 qian and 5 fen for Shashi wheat, and 4 taels and 4 qian for Zhenjiang wheat. All prices were 30 to 50 cents lower than the previous market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, both the Road and Indigenous Districts were buying needle eyebrow green tea from Yihe, Jinlong, Xiehe, and other firms without leaving any behind, and transactions were very active. Although the path for Precious Eyebrow Green Tea sales was lively, the selling prices were seen to be low by 10 to 20 taels, and the market was still difficult to consider optimistic. The Gongxi brand of White Head Tea was very scarce in the indigenous districts, and the Russian Cooperative Society's acceptance prices were especially harsh. Chinese tea merchants insisted on not selling because the quantity was not large.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in this area continued to be firm and prosperous. New York silk mills' futures demand has not waned, and French firms have also continued to make purchases. The current futures market sentiment is thriving. Yesterday, 150 packages of Shangzhong Shanghai white fabric were purchased by Qianli and others, and prices have generally risen.</p>

<p>Before the establishment of ice plants, sales in Shanghai were sluggish, and Xiamen factories have recently stopped production one after another, so the supply has often been unavailable. However, because the demand for Five Blessings ice is relatively broad, Xiamen factories have already prepared to start boiling, and the inventory here is also gradually becoming scarce. Yesterday, the Number Square also opened with over 100 boxes at a price of 6 taels and 7 qian per block. Few other brands opened, and as autumn sales approach, the market conditions should gradually become active.</p>

<h3 id="e374">The Question of Sovereignty over New Antarctic Land <a href="#e374" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c374" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">374</a></h3>
<p>Antarctic exploration initially stemmed from the curiosity of scientists, but recently it has gradually become a matter of political interest. Since 1774, through the efforts of Cook, Weddell, Bellingshausen, Ross, Shackleton, and most recently Wilkins and Ellsworth, successive discoveries have revealed the Antarctic continent. It is known to be rich in valuable minerals such as gold, copper, coal, and diamonds. The Southern Ocean is also abundant in whales. Furthermore, it is understood that these locations can serve as air bases for global aviation. Consequently, there is no shortage of those seeking sovereignty, particularly the United Kingdom and the United States. Each claims prior discovery and names the locations after their own people, drawing worldwide attention. However, with the initial completion of naval reduction treaties, the United Kingdom is unwilling to create further disputes at this time and adopts a temporarily tolerant attitude. Nevertheless, it is foreseeable that this will become a major international issue in the future.</p>

<p>The Antarctic continent... Much of the land within the ice is yet to be determined. The coastline is approximately 14,000 [li] in length. Currently, only 5,000 [li] have been discovered. Present-day explorers are focused on whether the Antarctic region is a single continent, two major islands, or multiple fragmented landmasses connected by ice. The graphic indicates the location of what is called Little America.</p>
