<p>使中華民國國家、在世界上立於平等地位、致力於斯者四十年如一日、閻馮之亂、可說是反對中國之自由平等、希冀與外力勾結、以保存其割據勢力與權利、依世界大勢言、以一四分五裂之國家、百欲與其他統一國家立於平等地位、不啻緣木求魚、數月以來、因閻馮叛亂、致國家與人民所受之痛夺損失、我前方將士所</p>

<p>上之榮譽、國家欲圖强盛所應取之途徑、在能運用外交上之良好方針、尤在能認</p>
<p>識世界大勢之所在、及何國對我有良好態度、能以平等待我、何國對我取侵略政策、不以平等待我、其能以平等待我者、我當視爲良友、其不以平等待我者、我當謀正當對付、試以俄國而言、該國與我國疆域毘連、國内境况、一切與我相等、似應與我國比較有極良好的友誼、用爲何情感不佳、國家交至今尙未恢復、因爲他採用第三國際主義、欲推翻全世界政治及人類幸福、要使中國與他同化、效其殺人放火造成恐怖世界之行動、並時常向中國肆意搗亂、此尙有何友誼之可言、此外有一二國家、對中國並無侵略土地野心、惟以商戰方策、奪取中國經濟權、致利害上汪免衝突、其對於領事裁判權、如終不肯放棄者、在利用此不平等制度、使在華</p>

<p>本屆大會、又有一重要事件、應加以研究者、則爲修改盟約、以求適合巴黎非戰公約是也、該公約與法外長白利安·美前國務卿凱洛格之名、有固結不解之關係、自盟約生效十年以來、各會員國認爲應將並須將盟約關於戰爭各點、盡行删去、和平之進步、於此可見、予深信此舉甚爲重要、並認爲吾人可彼此互相欣質、中國曾參預修改盟約委員會所造報告之工作、該報告現列諸君之前、中國對於修改之舉、當然贊同、吾人且望修改案能從速實行、若果實行、默觀盟約與巴黎公約、彼此互相爲用、誠饒興趣、而有所啓迪、蓋公約對於盟約則予以道德上之鼓勵、盟約對於公約、則予以實體上之力量與後盾也、</p>
<p>最終余請論歐洲聨合會之計劃、此計劃固又與法外長白利安之甸相依附也、余爲非歐洲人、余代表國家其面積人口及問題之複雜、復與全歐洲相等、以此地步立言中國代表團、以爲歐洲聨合會之計劃與國際聨合會兩者、不必有天然不相容之點、蓋歐洲聨合、若果告成、僅可爲地方局部之協定、仍在國際聨合會之内也、</p>

<p>潘局長致辭今日上海市第三屆國貨運動大會、假座市商會、舉行國産綢緞展覽會、承諸位惠臨參觀、非常歡欣榮幸、此欠國貨運動大會、自七日開幕起、迄今一週以來、用盡種種方法、宣傳我國自製貨品切於實用、尤特别注意於衣服材料、衣食住行、爲人生四大需要、此次大會、故特别致力宣傳用中國材料做衣服、我們知道、洋貨入超到中國來、年逹四萬萬元、亦即每人每年大約有一元貢獻於外國人、此數至少有一半或三分之一用於穿衣、可知國人醉心洋貨服裝材料、固然穿西將的没有中國貨的材料、就是穿中裝的、也不知中國綢緞布疋的好處、都趨向於洋貨、我們曾於十月九日、在大華飯店舉行國貨時裝展覽會、其時參加表演的、許多閨閣名媛、都穿的國貨材料製咸的各種服裝、覺得質魁顔色花紋樣樣都好、而且高尙名貴、絕不讓美於洋貨、這是參與該會的人、有目共暏的、不過該會偏重於女界、又因門票限制、未能廣延來賓、深覺宣傳未周、故特商同國貨綢緞業同業公會、於本日大會閉幕之前、舉行國産綢緞展覽會、請各位前來參觀、須知各廠出品很多、今日陳列的、不過選擇數種、分爲等級、以備各人按照生活程度及需要知所取材、並且可以與外國貨一加比較、因爲中國人往往有崇拜洋貨輕視中貨的心理、見市上所售衣料、如查精緻、即以爲洋貨、商人迎合心理、亦將錯就錯、當洋貨出售、這個錯誤觀念、自參觀今日的陳列品後、當可一掃而空、希望諸位從此購用國貨衣服、如做綢衣務必購中國綢緞、倘仍展絕中國已有的好綢緞、而買外國綢緞、這樣洋奴成性、我信諸位絕不至此、並且希望諸位不僅以身作則、還要勸導别人、一致起來、購用中國貨的衣料、</p>

<p>交涉經過海員公會派員與太古怡和等交涉增加海員工薪、太古屢次表示、對於增薪原則、並不反對、而以本年生意清淡、要求展緩增加、因之未有結果、在上星期二、海員代表與太古談判此事、太古祗允將米貼移作增薪、爲海員所反對、迨至雙十節、太古公司爲求增薪案之早日解决、乃自動的請虞洽卿、與航業公會主会陳伯剛、出任調解、</p>

<p>今願讓去一元、改爲一次加五元、决定後、立即公函虞氏、請其轉逹、茲因虞氏晉京、須俟其返滬時、方可解决、</p>

<p>— 王劍侯</p>
<p>八月中旬間。本報國際電訊。載有美國普渡大學中國學生C.　K.　Shun覆車慘死之消息一則。按普渡大學位於美國安第那省之西辣斐德。係美國素負盛名之私立大學。至戚陳樹桂君。上海交通大學學生。於去夏負笈赴美。亦轉入該校肄業。與上述慘死之C.　K.　Shun即孫家珂君。及同車畢命之許包泉君。同校同學。且極友善。而二君之慘劇。又正發生於駕車躬迎陳君於美德勝之途中。我雖不殺伯仁。伯仁實由我而死。陳君悲痛之忱。逹於極點。爰將其來函所述慘劇之始</p>
<p>末。轉告於讀者。</p>
<p>普渡大學上年度有中國學生三十餘人。分攻電機機械等科。陳君於本屆畢業後。即乘暑假期往美德勝某工廠實習。期且滿矣。忽許孫二君自西辣斐德以書抵陳。約日駕駛新車來美德勝迎歸。陳君俟之屆日許孫二人果駕車自辣斐德向美德勝出發。車廂中後坐中國同學四人。沿途流覽風景。載遊載行。興致勃發。惟美德勝距辣斐德有十一小時之汽車路程。許等出發時已在下午。預計非午夜不能逹目的地。因於中途開足馬力。飛越前進。祇覺風馳電掣。絕塵而逝。速率已逹六十哩以外。不意斯時迎面駛來一車。許車欲避不及。急捩機殺停。詎知行勢太急。車身忽離地躍起一丈許。覆而復起者凡三次。車身全燬。許孫二君死焉。慘哉。當車第一次顚覆時。車篷受震破裂。坐車廂中之四人。全被　出。得免於難。蓋亦幸矣。</p>
<p>許君閩候人。其先爲美國威省大學學生。孫君津沽人。其先爲吾國南開大學學生。二君年纔弱冠。長體育。精音樂。擅攝影。駕車游泳。尤所特嗜。最可惜者。二君家固豪於資。而本人又賦性獨優。對於所修學課。勤奮研求。成績超羣。以是合校師生。交相穳贊頌。在本屆數百畢業生中。授優異生學位者凡四十二人。我中國學生獲得此項榮譽者。僅三人。即陳樹桂君與死者二君是也。三人年相若。志相若。出八相偕。同學僅一載。親密逾手足。課餘之睱。輙又合力規劃關於工業救國之大計。滿期以學成歸來。爲祖國謀建設。爲社會謀幸福。孰意飛來横禍。慘死異邦。深可傷已。先是孫君姊氏在美邦亦置有汽車一輛。今夏離美赴歐時。弟欲得之。姊靳而未與曰。吾弟性好冒險。恐肇禍端。又孰知其竟以身殉哉。而許君則去國已久。家尙有七十三歲之老父。正日夕倚閭盼愛子歸來。噩耗傳到。老涙縱横。悲慟欲絕矣。</p>
<p>當日陳君得訊由美德勝趕回。揣心泣血。哀傷自不待言。當與許君十年好友柯忠正君爲料理身後各事。並於九月五日在辣斐德爲二君治喪。屆日中外親友。及普校師生。全來致祭。並由敎授在日報上爲文以悼之。想見二君平日之學問道德見重於儕輩也。</p>
<p>乃者柯君及縣姊等護送二君遺骸於本月三日搭亞細亞皇后輪歸國。先期並託由家兄接洽一切轉運事宜。以期早日安骨於故土。魂兮有知。其速來歸。我撫此三尺銅棺。不禁重有所感焉。因爲之記。</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>錢韻珊女士者。名畫家雲鹤老友之女公子也。淵源家學。擅畫工詩。曾作一箑。爲南田花卉。清芬妍秀。不染時趨。輾轉爲李幼竹君所見。幼竹。六合佳士也。竺嗜丹青。展翫之餘。愛不忍釋。知韻珊尙待字閨中。乃委友執柯以聘焉。好事旣成。迺於今歲雙十節。爲合卷之喜。新嫁娘調鉛殺粉。期前勤事藻染。成四屏一軸。爲洞房之點綴。畫各有詩。均清新可誦。如梅竹壽帶云。紅梅綠竹滿園春。又見詔華閱歲新。自喜圖成名益壽。携來可祝養年人。荷塘翠羽云。池塘十里雨初收。點水蜻蜓葉上留。掠過翠禽詩意遠。畫船載酒晚凉游。秋葵黃鳥云。秋葵大麗鬥芬芳。海外移來種異常。小鳥高飛如錯認。居然魏紫與姚黃。山茶雙雀云。圍爐小閣下重簾。祇愛長吟酒數添。記得雪融花徑暖。一雙凍雀噪晴檐。軸繫以五律云。繪事學名賢。繁華到眼前。錦堂新富貴。瑶島小神仙。幸得花常好。欣逢月正圓。高齏懸粉壁。如意祝年年。作吉羊語。尤爲得體。書法亦娟逸。三絕之才。求諸巾幗。不易覯也。想見閨房之樂。不啻趙松雪之與管夫人。搏泥雅謔。爾我不分。美滿良緣。在温柔史上添一楮葉矣。</p>

<p>— 爽秋</p>
<p>能仁寺爲八本兒女英雄傳之一。艷秋飾張金鳳。薄施淡掃。布衣荆釵。絕肖小家碧玉。艷秋之濃妝淡妝。並皆美覯而欲領略其天然之美。自以此劇爲最合宜。唱工極多。音律段段佳妙。十三妹提親時。其神情含羞佯笑。嬌艷欲滴。配以芙蓉草之十三妹。舉止落落。言論侃侃。相得益彰。</p>
<p>鴛鴦塜爲最高尙最純潔用情深至之哀情佳劇。以婚烟之不自由。屈於舊道德之裁制。又不敢衝决家庭之範圍。雙方之用情。一往不返。遂决以生命殉之。是亦痴情男女之最可哀者也。艷秋飾王五姐。有四平調。有七字二簧。有反二簧。其唱工之繁難吃力。腔調之新穎圓轉。在一切唱工覻之上。其表情之棲慘。音調之悲切。能令觀者聽者悲哀涙落。而不能自制。可謂神乎其技矣。　歲蜚聲京滬。有品皆碑。此次配以姜妙香之謝招郎。芙蓉草之王嫂。錦上添花。洵哀感頑艷之傑構也。</p>

<p>庚午之秋。將開個人畫展於海上。終日揮灑。手不釋筆。精神爲之罷恭。遂於中秋之午。偕愛國女校友生十餘人出游。及抵砲台灣。乃獨與四五人赴寳山。寳山瀕江依海。且當揚子黃浦交流之衝。而又密邇上海。宜爲一大巨鎭。而乃城小人稀。若不勝其幽　荒凉者。入南門。下車於鼓樓。全城之中心也。西行觀小學。樹木掩映。有台池之勝。南行爲民衆敎育館。城隍廟所改建也。客歲城隍以失頭聞於遐邇。今且一掃而空。而上海之城隍則仍巍然於香烟繚繞之中。受世人之膜拜。然則神亦有幸有不幸耶。觀師範學校。校枕城垣。雄堞之上。聳一台曰望江。烟波浩渺。風帆三五。出没其間。天邊横亙一線。崇明島也。出西門。至公園。園頗隘。循江隄。深草没脛。隄邊木椿。相比如長櫛。入北門。御車歸砲台灣。食於廢隄大石之上。微風習習。江水衝擊。𥒐然而躍。同游陳生大驚而逃。挽之始怯然而立。觀者皆大笑樂。日旣夕乃步行至吴淞。乘車回校。晚餐畢。以游興未闌。乃糾合學生數十百人。相率作賞月之舉。出校沿江灣路。載笑載言。載馳載奔。直至北四川路始返。時月明如鏡。夜凉似水微雲片片。似依戀月光而不忍遽去。路旁樹影婆娑。時聞人家拇戰之聲。及歸校。夜已深。取未成之畫。加以點染。月光自窗隙射入。似慰余之寂寞焉。</p>

<p>繼而細視。始知皆以油色繪成之佈景。佈景上部。直透圓形建築之天窗。取光與野外相合。下面築成泥溝。部佈置當年滑鐵盧地方之景物。横於泥土中者。皆傷兵死馬。血肉模糊。。慘不忍暏。畫中各部。皆有說明。此圖係比國學院派畫家狄珊司所製。用寫實之筆法及印象之色彩而成者。稱圖偉大。畫風亦新頴。非尋常佈景畫所能比擬也。觀畢出館。復前行。參觀各國所立之紀念碑。行五里許。又見一碑。碑傍雕刻垂　一雙。亦係紀念拿破嵛之物也。今日之滑鐵盧。田連阡陌。嚝闊數十里。僅存幾處紀念之物。惟該地名聞世界。凡到比國之外人。莫不爭先往游。余在該處游四小時。僅喚起暦史上之慨念而已。</p>
<p>三比京市政廳歐洲各國首都之市政廳。大半皆歷史上著名之建築。比京之市政廳。用谷底克Gothic式所建。（昔日羅馬之式樣）莊麗雄偉及其雕刻之精細。可與巴黎之聖母堂並美。相對者。有舊白王宫。中有一廣塲。塲中設賣花攤數十處。名花爛漫。襯以崇高古雅之建築。分外可觀。經廣塲入市政廳之内。參觀須購券。進内近視建築。無處不美。壁間陳列名人肖像數十幀。皆和蘭畫家之手筆。向右再人一廳。四邊壁上。懸織物之肖像十六幀。織工極精。光暗與色彩配合相宜。遠視之。宛如名繪。幾不能辨其爲織物也。由此進議事廳。中置古式之桌椅。四壁皆嵌以名畫。其餘用器。亦皆精緻異常。自議事廳向右。入市政廳之辦公室數間。壁間亦有名畫。末後參觀敎堂一間。爲廳中人作新禱而設。堂之中央。置一耶穌之像。下置蠟臺數具。如吾國廟字彷彿。堂内光線不亮。陳設整然。令人頓起嚴肅之感。出市政廳。復乘電車至離比京附近之郊外。地名臘功。該處有一公園。園廣僅十餘畝奇葩竸放。綠樹遮空。園之背後。一片森林。中隔一湖。不渡游人。人工美與自然美。遥遥相對。誠游人休憇之勝地也。再由園外向右沿大道行二十分鐘。又抵一公園。此園有中國塔一座。高數十丈。並有日本式之亭榭數處。聞此係昔日從巴拿馬賽會塲運來之物。尙有東方美術館一所。陳列中國及日本之古物。參觀怱促。不及記憶。臘功一帶。有王族别邸。路極清潔。道傍植樹整齊。兼有樹林。可通行人。夕陽影裡。尤覺可愛。在深林中流連忘返。直至黃昏。始歸旅舍。</p>

<p>巡游意大利日記</p>
<p>（三）羅馬十日（一）</p>
<p>—不死之城—La　Vile　eternelle—</p>
<p>六月一日—西班牙名作展與日本現代畫展</p>
<p>六月一日的清早便到了羅馬了。當結束三十六小時長途的行程。走進這不死的古城的時候我們都感到非常的愉快。對於羅馬的事物懷着熱烈的仰慕的我。尤其覺得十二分得意。</p>
<p>走出車站。就由一位操着半生不熟的法語的引導者。引我們到離車站不遠的一家旅店裏面住下。他說這是法蘭西人。本人慣住的旅店。每人每天十二個利耳。房間亦高大亦清雅。大家很滿意。這一條路呌做Via　Principe　Vmberto距火車站十分鐘便到。無論到那一方面去。終是很便捷。這算是羅馬的適中地點。</p>
<p>憧憬了多年的羅馬。終於是如願相償了。我們都有急於要走進那美的大的神秘的寳庫的好奇心。所以在旅店盥洗過。就怱怱走出去了。在羅馬街上走的時候。完全像脫離了現代的光景到處目暏廢墟。石柱。那些古羅馬的人文的遺跡。在悠久的二三千年風雨暴露中。傳到我們的目中。不覺就看得自身變做一種渺小短促無常的幻影。適然過其前而已。不但是古跡。就是沿途無論是家屋是商店是牆垣。都是灰暗的茶黃色。在明快的日光之下。顯着蒼然古氣。但在這一切顯着古老之中。凡是房屋的窗和門都塗滿了翡翠那般剌目的鮮綠。正與走在北京的胡同裏。到處看見那滿塗朱红的大門。有相類的剌戟。</p>
<p>走到車站前的石舗的廣塲中央。於是就坐了MP號的公共摩托車到新美術館去看西班牙傑作展覽會。這是我們在路上閒步計劃今天觀覽程序那時候就詢問過。探聽過。知道今天正是意大利的統一紀念日。一切博物院美術院都是關門的。因此。就預定上午看西班牙名畫展下午去看日本現代美展。在今天意大利人熱烈慶祝他們的建國紀念。市街之中滿颺着赤白綠三色的意大利國旗。瀰漫於羅馬全市的天眞爛漫的樂天的市民。唱着他們的國歌。一陣拍手。一陣狂呼。歡躍從他們的心流水似的湧出。我很少見過這樣的氣分。摩托車幾經曲折高低。到處的廣塲上的石柱噴水池畔的雕刻。終是使人吃驚的。</p>

<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>（十三）夜醉</p>
<p>每天很早就要被同學們催醒、往野外寫生去、</p>
<p>到夜裏、大家都閒着了、數小時的茶話會後便就寢、這回、馮君和廖君來邀我出去吃點東西、或飲點酒、</p>
<p>我們離開客棧穿過一些黑暗的路、尋覓一家比較清潔的飯館、</p>
<p>『在北門外、白天我寫生回來時看到、那是一家天津館、很好而且便宜、』廖說、</p>
<p>『呌什麽名字呢？』</p>
<p>『名字我忘記了、但我們走到那裏就會知道的、在一個高屋子的對門、是的、一家照相館的對門、』</p>
<p>『很遠吧、現在已經九點鐘了、』我說、</p>
<p>『反正没有事、有什麽關係呢、』</p>
<p>於是我們尋覓着走、</p>
<p>那是一家小小的天津食堂、我們走進去占了一方桌子、</p>
<p>二十分後、我們在飲着了、</p>
<p>『這種北方的菜味如何、徐先生吃得來嗎？』</p>
<p>『哦、很好、很好、』我挾着一塊辣子雞、『這個、我覺得這個很好吃、但那魚也不差、』</p>
<p>『喝酒、喝酒、』</p>
<p>於是大家乾了幾杯、茶房送上第二壼、第是三壼酒來、</p>
<p>『我們今夜喝醉了、非要喝醉了纔停止、』</p>
<p>『爲什麽呢、醉了很討厭、』</p>
<p>我本來很能喝點、因爲在一年新年的時候大醉了一次、我不願意喝酒了、近幾年來、雖然也常常和幾個朋友到一家小小的酒家去喝一兩杯、但總不敢多喝下去、今夜的酒量、恐怕是幾年來没有有過的呢、我很怕要暈眩、竭力鎭靜着、可是馮已經有些興奮得暈亂了、</p>
<p>『不要再喝了吧、時候也不早了、不是十二點鐘後要戒嚴嗎、』</p>
<p>於是我們離開了菜館、醉迷迷地尋着黑暗的小街差亂地走着、只有廖比較清明些、因爲他喝得少、馮是眞的醉了、顚沛着步法、興奮地講話、酒氣蕩漾在夜空、</p>

<p>— 南蓀攝</p>
<p>『哈哈、徐先生、我、我說給你、我的』女人是你的同鄉、她愛我、不過她太不了解我了、她不了解我研究藝術……</p>
<p>「人們都是一樣、我受了人們的欺騙…有過轟轟烈烈的過去、如今我沈默了、不、我的心並没有因沈默而冷淡、……我爲什麽從事藝術…但是我的女人不了解了我……」</p>
<p>摸索着黑的街道、我們顚亂地回到客棧、馮没有停止他的說話。</p>
<p>（十四）爬山</p>
<p>兩三年來我没有爬過山了、雖然人没有老、好像行爲已經老了似的、可是這一回我和着這羣青年（其實我也是青年）爬山、我感到非常的興奮、</p>
<p>在未爬山之前、大家都買了一根木杖、</p>
<p>這是一個没有人又没有廟的山雖然不十分高、但他是筆立的、所以上去很不十分容易、</p>
<p>於是大家開始上進了、</p>
<p>我没有上去到三分之一、我已經很乏力了、攀援着樹枝、差不多兩隻手也當做了脚的爬着、喘着氣、心劇烈的跳動、倒在土上休息、但還有落在我後面的呢、胖的馮和着高跟鞋的蜜絲子、眞累死他們了、</p>
<p>於是我想起兩年前在南京由玄武湖走到紫金山、再爬上最高的頂巔、仍又下來走路到城門口的那種勇氣和力量民我眞感覺到現在的我是老了、我的青春已經逝去了啊、</p>
<p>不、我仍要繼續的爬上去、我要恢復我青春的熱烈與勇敢、我要爬上去、我要誇耀给青年們看、雖然我是做着你們的敎師—斷傷了天眞的敎師—但我的精神、肉體仍和你們一樣的活潑、熱情、勇敢……</p>
<p>終於、大家都達到了頂巔、</p>
<p>天風吹拂我們汗濕的衣衫、撫慰這一羣孩子的勇敢的但疲乏的精力的森林在呼嘨着、糢糊的景色展開在我們眼底</p>
<p>我們都躺下身體休息、仰望空廊的天、太陽晒在我們的身上、</p>
<p>楊是最先爬上來的、握着小旗在舞動、宋是總不會知道疲乏的、他帶着畫具、熱水壼、和充飢的糧食、他到了頂巔就支開架子作畫、但我眞希奇密斯于穿着高跟鞋也爬上到山頂來的勇氣、</p>
<p>在休息的疲倦稍稍减輕之後、太陽已經漸漸西斜了、我們都整理衣服、准備下山、但宋的畫還没有作完、</p>
<p>『徐先生、不要急、來改一改畫、讓走得慢的人先走吧、』</p>
<p>於是我給他很快的改了一下、他收拾起東西、很大一堆背在自身上、尋着一條筆立直的山道、跑下去、在先走的人還有到山麓的時候、他早已在下面呌喊了、</p>
<p>下山比上山容易、但疲乏得恐怕比上山還甚、口裏又過分的燥渴、於是我們向一個村家討凉水喝、</p>
<p>鄉下的婦女們都很羞怕而希奇的偷看我們、幾隻大狗狂亂的吠呌、</p>

<p>在這學期開始不到兩星期、我就聽着同學中的互相談論復旦又加入江大運動载的事情、這個好消息的傳來、眞使我驚喜並至、以前复旦不是江大會裏的一份子麽、爲了一些小事而萌退志的、現在居然又肯重新加入了、雙方並没有什麽。足見以前的私見、大家都能諒解、消失、而注重在國際的地位上去、不禁爲中國體育前途之幸、固然、並不是因復旦一加入中國的體育前途就可以慶幸起來、爲的是個個能自覺、大家肯同舟共濟呀、</p>
<p>現在讓我來談談近來復旦的體育情形吧、</p>
<p>此地我先得要聲明一句、以前的復旦並不是不注重體育、爲了退出江大運動會少個參加和表演的塲所、英雄無用武之地、對於各種運動方面興致上比較要疏淡些、</p>
<p>這次加入之後、開學不到二週、校内關於體育的佈告、已到處可見、學校方面和私人所組織的什麽球隊械正在那裏招兵、挑選手、開大會……五花八門、鬧個不休、其中有幾個還特設女子部呢、</p>
<p>近來學校方面爲普及學生運動起見、舉行各學院錦標比賽、正在開始進行、私人所組織的團體、亦在互相挑戰中、</p>
<p>越野跑在滬上的聲譽用不着我再來多講、大家都知道的、每於傍晚清晨的時候、翔殷路上跑馬廳畔、只見一班勇糾糾的健兒在那裏競逐奔走、造他們的紀錄、</p>
<p>校内是不必說、課餘的時候、運動塲上一簇簇的男女同學時在練習他們（或她們）的球藝呢、似乎是讀書非有强健的體魄不可、（青）</p>

<h3 id="c226">畢加梭論藝術書 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 陳德明譯</p>
<p>現代法蘭西藝壇怪傑畢加梭（Picasso）是後期印象派大畫家、是立體派的領袖、又是野獸派的創闢者、眞是一個多才多藝的人、人們稱之爲藝術界中的唐裘安（ＤonJuan大詩人拜倫詩中所歌詠的多才多藝的美男子·）是最確當不過的、不過因爲他的藝術是變化無窮的、他的態度也就極難捉摸、他的周身常常園繞着一種神秘的霧氣、令人不易覩其眞相、大原因是因爲他素來只作畫不而不開口、近來他忽然一時興起、操筆作了一篇洋洋灑灑的論藝術書、轉載於法國著名藝術雜誌造形（Formes）中、氏在此信把他的藝術見角盡情披露、而於現時一般虚僞的藝術尤極盡嘻笑怒駡之能事、此信之重要與可貴、自不待言、因亟譯出、以餉讀者、（下面是畢氏的信）　　譯者附誌</p>
<p>人們通常以爲我是一個鑽尋家、</p>
<p>我不鑽尋、我只偶然發見、</p>
<p>有幾個人把立體主義弄成了一種體育上的功課、我們每天看見嬴弱不堪的人装出體格强健的神氣、他們以爲把東西化成立方形、就能獲得『力』的效果、我的最合邏輯的用全力製作着的作品給他們拿去用了製作了些機械式的毫無現實性的東西出來、</p>
<p>譬如你們看『一位著名的立體主義畫家、』他是一個『達到目的』的人、</p>
<p>在一九○○年左右的時候、他的父親對他說、『我兒、我送你到　巴黎去學新藝術、』他唯唯服從、他一到巴黎、就製作新藝術作品起來、這種新藝術作品是可與『春季雜誌』（按係法國低級藝術、畢氏引之以譏該新藝術作家）中的藝術作品媲美的、</p>
<p>你們可以意想得到這般效顰我的藝術與我的作品甚至於效顰我的方法的人使我頭痛到何等地步呢、</p>
<p>一天、幾個聰明的寫實主義（Surroalisme）的青年作家在我的速寫簿中看見幾張只有幾個點子和幾根綫條的速寫和鉛筆畫、事實如下—我對於天文圖極加嘆賞、我在它們的科學上的表意之外發現一種美感、因此一天我就動手構一張圖、圖上是許多的點子、中間用綫條接連、還有些點子是不用綫接起來的、表示天上的星點、我的意思是預備日後用這張構圖放進一張寫實作品裏面去作爲一部份的、可是這些超寫實主義者啊、哦、他們眞是聰明、他們一致用着堅决的口吻說、這些構圖恰合他們的抽象底觀念、</p>
<p>我記趙一件發生於一九二五年的事情、那時幾個友人堅邀我去參觀那巟謬的代表低級趣味的雖然在敎育上是有少許價値的展覽——國際装飾藝術展覽、他們對我說、『畢加梭、你會看出那裏全部的出品是受你的影響的、你會在那裏面發現你自已、你會認出那些作品是你的手筆、』他們這樣說、大槪是想討我歡喜、</p>
<p>設想米啓安琪羅（Michael　Angelo）應幾個友人之邀、前去赴宴、那幾個友人起來歡迎他說、『我們剛才呌人送來了—』</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>只受你的摩西像的感興而造的文藝復興時期的碟架、『你想在這種情形之下米啓』安琪羅的面部上當作何種表情、</p>
<p>一個人從他的同時代人的作品中去求感興、是愚不可及的一件事、我每次發見我自已被人倣效、幾乎覺得有一種身體的不適、</p>
<p>装飾藝術與畫架上的繪畫毫無相似之處、前者是功利主義的東西、後者是一種高尙的玩藝、一只靠背椅的含意是一個人可以把背上靠在上面、這是一件用品、不是藝術、</p>
<p>在一九○六年之中、塞尙（Cezanne）的影響到處都深入進去、構圖的藝術對稱的藝術和色調的藝術一時大爲盛行、這其間就起了兩個問題、我看到繪畫有一種與事物的忠實底再現分離而獨立的内在價値、我問我自已、一個人還是應當表現他所知道的事實呢、還是表現他所看見的事實、繪畫旣然有它的獨立的一種美、那末一個人就有創造一種抽象的美的可能、只要這種美不失掉繪畫性就是了、在許多年數之中、立體主義者别無目的、只有繪畫的目的、爲繪畫而繪畫、他們拒絕那些不是繪畫藝術的主要原素的東西、</p>
<p>數學家伯賴塞（Princet）常時同我們在一塊討論美學上的問題、他有一個理想、想創造一種特别供給畫家應用的幾何學、這個理想並不新奇、因爲一些官立學院本來用着文西（Leonarpo　da　Vinci）的幾何學、</p>
<p>顔色的用途並不廣大、它只代表着體積中的構造的原素、人人知道一個白色的面比一個面積同樣大小的黑色的面爲大、這種理論非但是淺近、而且是有些幼稚、可是一般庸人不遺餘力的在那個淺近的理論之中去挿出了許多的繪畫原理和公律來、跑到我這裏來對我大講其繪畫藝術、</p>
<p>在我的眼光中看來、一幅畫决不是一個目的、倒是一種偶遇的快事、亦可稱之爲經騐、在造形的領域裏面、色彩是度量的標準、我們不願把我們自已封鎖在科學的幾何學内、可是世間儘有許多人費了一生的心力在這個方向裏面搜索結果一無所獲、而藝術日壞、</p>
<p>立體主義畫家自已都看不懂了他們自已的作品、便設法發明種種虚玄的理論出來爲他們自已的作品辯護、可是立體主義確是一片自由的藝術園地、没有一種武斷的敎條、同是立體主義的畫、一幅表現物的觀念、一幅儘可以表現物的外觀、獨立並存、不相妨礙、</p>
<p>事實上、人們决不抄襲自然、也不摹倣自然、人們不過把意想的東西加上實際形態的衣冠而已、我們决不因爲要恢復自然而棄絕繪畫、反之、我們是要從自然移動到繪畫上去、有許多畫家把太陽化作了一個黃點子、同時却已有一般畫家得了他們的藝術與智巧之助把一個黃點子化作一個太陽、　　從自然裏面抽出來的幾種原素能使一幅畫有變化、惟其如此、所以我們與那些受本人自已的槪念的指導而再現物的自然外觀的古來大師們的理想接近、</p>
<p>我深信在一切繪畫的根源裏面、我們都能發現一種主觀地組織着的幻象、或者一種像蘭博（Rimband現代法蘭西大畫家）所有的那種心靈感悟、</p>
<p>我絲毫不以主體爲重要、却以全力擁護客體、你們須尊重客體、</p>
<p>你們勿把你們那些最慣熟底思想的要點或次序混亂顚倒了、</p>
<p>我們知道近今的藝術不是眞理、</p>
<p>藝術是謊言、這謊言引導我們趨近眞理、至少能夠使我們趨近那些我們所能想到的眞理、一個畫家應該想些方法出來牑啓羣衆、使他看到他的謊言是眞理、</p>
<p>我覺得『鑽尋』兩字實在是難解、我相信這兩個字是没有意義的、人們决不會去學一個走路時俛倒了頭希望命運之神在他面前掉着一袋金錢的人、一個人即無鑽尋的意思而偶然有所發見、結果即不爲羣衆所崇拜、亦足以引起他們的注意了、</p>
<p>我所繪緢的不是我所鑽尋的東西、而是我所偶然發現的東西、意向在結果上並無影響、西班牙人有一句成語說、一一個人要證明他自已的愛情之眞僞、是須用行爲來證明、而在於言辭一、鑽尋一這一種思想把我們的許多畫家引入虚玄之境去、那可以說是現代藝術最大的一個錯誤、『鑽尋』的精神毒害了許多人、他們因爲不現代藝術的積極方面、便想畫那肉眼所不能見的東西、—肉眼所不能見的東西是藝術所表現不出的、</p>
<p>一張畫作成以後所表現出來的東西往往比作畫者所想表現的東西爲多、作者驚呆了、便把那些初不自料的結果加以猜想附會、</p>
<p>我們常常可以看到一幅繪畫的製成是自然的、没有預算的、</p>
<p>人們高談着自然主義、以與現代藝術相抗、可是誰曾看見一件『自然的』作品、</p>
<p>自然與藝術是兩種絕對不同的現象</p>
<p>藝術使我們有了表現我們的槪念與智慧的可能、自然却不曾給我們這種可能、從原人—他們的藝術是與自然相去甚離的—起一直下來到大衛（Kavid）安格爾（Ingres）和蒲格羅（Bouguerean）這中間的一切把自然再現着的畫家都深知藝術永遠是藝術而非自然、從藝術的觀點看來民無論什麽抽象的形象和什麽實在的形象、都是不存在的、存在的只是形象的宗法化表現而已、</p>
<p>立體主義與其他一切畫派無異、同樣的質素和同樣的原則統治着一切不同的畫派、立體主義始終不爲人所了解、這個事實是没有重要的意義在裏面的、也並不證明了羣衆的意見是對的、我不識德文、一本德文書在我的眼中只是白與黑、可是我不武斷說德文是不存在的、</p>
<p>立體主義不是一種新藝術的種子、也不是一個新藝術的萌芽、它不過代表原存的繪畫形式發展的一個時期而已、這些形式實現以後、就有獨立存在之權、</p>
<p>如果說目前的立體主義尙在幼稚時代、那末一種新立體主義的形式將來是會産生的、數幾何學心理變態學等等科學都曾給人們用來解釋立體主義、那些解釋都只是文學、立體主義追求造形的目的、這些目的本身可以令人滿足、我們可以解釋這些目的爲一種表現我們的理知和眼睛在形象與色彩所允許的可能範圍内所能看到的一切、這是何等樣的一個取之不竭的快樂與發現的源泉啊、</p>
<p>享利盧梭（Henri　Rousseau按盧氏爲現代法國大畫家、其畫富於原始性、）不是奇特、只是心力發達到了完全的程度、我第一次買到他的一幅油畫、可算是一椿厅遇、一天我在　殉道街上徜徉、看見一個玩具商在他的店舖外的牆壁上整理油畫、·一幅肖像畫引起着我的注意、那肖像是一個婦人的面孔、狀貎冷酷堅决完全是一個法國婦女的狀貎、那幅油畫面積龐大、我問着價錢、那個商人說、一五個法郎、如果你把畫面上的東西刮去了、你還可以在那畫布重畫一張畫呢、</p>
<p>那幅畫是法國派中最眞實的一幅心理底肖像畫、</p>
<p>人們常常用『進化』一個名詞、而都把它誤用、這事使我詫異不置、</p>
<p>藝術無過去、亦無將來、不能在現在時候占地位的藝術將來亦必無地位、希臘的藝術與埃及的藝術不屬於過去、它們在今日比它們在昨日更有生意、變化不是進化、一個藝術家在他的表現力面上加以變化、那不是改變了他的心地、人人都有變化之權、甚至於畫家也有這種權能、</p>
<p>我永遠依照我自已的方針而製作、我不耐煩講什麽鑽尋的精神、我表現我所目見的東西、</p>
<p>我不從事『默想、』我也不把光陰費在『嘗試』上、</p>
<p>我遇有什麽意思要表白、就用那在我看來以爲最自然的方法和態度表白着</p>
<p>世界上没有過渡藝術這樣東西、世界上只有好的與壞的兩種畫家、好問的新聞記者與愛好藝術的人到我們這裏來、逼着我們把藝術上的信條與定義告訴他們、你們是畫家、他們豈是要我們製造定義與格言不成、</p>
<p>不錯、安格爾（法國古典畫派鉅子）與德臘克洛（Delaoroix　法國浪漫畫派大師）的思想集是刊印行世的、可是請問德臘克洛的那一種思想可與他的『薩逹那潑勒斯』Sardananapalusg一畫相比呢、</p>
<p>藝術是甚麽、如果我知道藝術是怎麽、我還得謹守秘密、</p>
<p>我不鑽尋、我只偶然發見、</p>

<h3 id="e12">German Social Democratic Party Demonstration <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Since the rise of the left and right extremist parties in the new German elections, the world has paid attention to the attitude of the so-called middle party, the Social Democratic Party. The victory, defeat, growth, and decline of these three parties not only relate to the future of the German political situation but also affect the overall world situation. Now, the Social Democratic Party has held a large-scale demonstration of more than 80,000 people and declared that it is willing to use force to protect democratic politics when necessary. This shows that the democratic faction is also unwilling to show weakness, and the situation of confrontation between the left, middle, and right parties has been formed. The future of the German political situation has become even more unpredictable from now on.</p>
<p>Today, there are three types of political systems competing in Europe: democracy, fascism, and proletarianism. Since the decline of the monarchical system, democracy has flourished, and people's hearts have turned to republicanism, and parliamentary politics has become popular for a time. Later, Italian fascism and Soviet proletarianism rose up and competed with it, forming a tripartite situation. Now, many countries with parliamentary politics are in turmoil, and people are gradually disgusted with it. Therefore, the two ideologies of fascism and proletarianism are attacking it more urgently, and their power is growing. Parliamentary politics is in a precarious situation. The situation of competition among political systems in Europe is generally nothing more than this, and Germany today has become a microcosm of Europe. The so-called left, middle, and right factions are the three ideologies mentioned above. Since Germany became a republic from an empire, democratic politics has been slightly established after ten years of operation. Now that the left and right extremist parties have gained an advantage in vying for political power, how easy is it for the democratic faction to support it in the middle and rise up to protect democratic politics with the strength of a weak union? This is indeed a problem worthy of attention in the world.</p>

<p>Ewart, an 18-year-old Englishman, went to China to visit his relatives because his parents lived in Beiping. He took the route through Siberia. Unexpectedly, his passport was stolen between Chita and Manchuria. Therefore, he was detained at the border on September 25th due to the lack of a passport and sent to Chita, imprisoned in a dirty room. There were no bedding, and he had to buy his own food. Russian law states that anyone who is not a member of the Red Party must buy their own food, which is very expensive and of very poor quality. Therefore, the money he brought is likely to run out, and the weather is getting colder, and there is no day for release. The physical and mental suffering he has endured can be imagined. The British Minister in Beiping, the British Minister in Moscow, and the British Consul in Harbin have worked together to rescue him, but to no avail. Usually, this type of case can be resolved within a week, but not now. Ewart's uncle is a member of the British Labour Party and has served twice as the chairman of the Independent Labour Party. In 1924, he joined the Labour Party cabinet as a Minister of Works. He usually handled party affairs and strongly advocated excluding communist elements. It is thought that Soviet Russia hates him, so they are treating his nephew harshly. (Reuters telegram on the 13th)</p>

<p>Death by Suffocation After Being Overcome with Anesthetic - Confession of a Former Soviet Official</p>
<p>Paris, December 12 (Pacific Telegram) - General Kutepov, former Chief of Staff of the Imperial Russian Army and a leader recognized by the White Russians since the revolution, was kidnapped here on January 26th.  His whereabouts have remained unknown.  Various evening newspapers have now obtained shocking news and are revisiting the old case.  According to reports, a former counselor at the Soviet Russian Embassy in Berlin, named Fiknair, who had long since left his post, has confessed that he served as the head of the White Russian Affairs Section of the Soviet State Security Bureau (commonly known as the Defense Bureau). He impersonated the chairman of the Central European Anti-Soviet Russian Association to send a telegram to General Kutepov, inviting him to a meeting.  He also dispatched a rented car to wait in front of Kutepov's residence. Unsuspecting, Kutepov boarded the car. At that moment, Soviet Russian secret agents hiding nearby rushed forward and covered his face with a cloth soaked in anesthetic.  Kutepov, suffering from a weak heart, died immediately.</p>
<p>Thus, the unofficial methods prepared by the Soviet Russian personnel were rendered useless.  Kutepov's body was apparently buried near Paris.</p>

<p>The Left and Right Factions are Incompatible, and the Current Cabinet's Lifespan is Unlikely to be Long - 80,000 Social Democrats Hold an Anti-Thuggery Demonstration</p>
<p>Berlin, December 12 (Guomin News Agency) - The political situation in Germany remains chaotic before the opening of the new parliament. The economic situation is very serious. However, given the current circumstances, the government should be able to withstand the initial attacks during the first few days of the parliament's opening. This is because the Social Democratic Party is deeply concerned that if the current cabinet falls, the right wing will gain even more power, inevitably threatening the party's advantage in the Prussian cabinet. Therefore, on important issues, they are unlikely to vote against the government, and the government is unlikely to be overthrown immediately. It is expected that the parliament will soon adjourn after its opening and reconvene in December after the various financial plans of the government's financial program have been carefully formulated. However, the cabinet will ultimately be unstable. Currently, the left and right wings of the German political parties have become absolutely incompatible. The right-wing parties that previously supported the government, even including the Nationalist Party, have claimed that the government's support from the Social Democratic Party is indirect, such as benevolent neutrality. This faction will no longer support the government. This kind of statement is tantamount to indirectly demanding the rejection of the Center Party and the alliance of the right-wing parties, including the National Socialist Party, to form a right-wing coalition cabinet. In addition, National Party leader Hugenberg also declared today that he would fight the current cabinet to the death and that there would be no room for reconciliation. The National Socialist Party and the Communist Party, as extreme factions, naturally hold the same attitude. Therefore, out of the 577 seats in the new parliament, 224 will permanently oppose the government. Only two groups, with 104 and 143 seats respectively, can support the current cabinet, and of these, only 106 seats are absolutely reliable.</p>
<p>Berlin, December 12 (Guomin News Agency) - Eighty thousand Social Democrats gathered this afternoon in Lustgarten in front of the Old Royal Palace to stage a large demonstration against the National Socialist Party. Former Speaker of the Parliament Löbe gave a speech, denouncing the evils of the National Socialist Party's attempt to establish a thuggery government and urging Social Democrats to use force to protect democratic politics when necessary and to take the opportunity to complete the unfinished business of the 1918 revolution. At that time, National Socialist Party members repeatedly tried to disrupt the demonstration, causing disturbances in the streets. Fortunately, the police had strong defenses and quickly restored order, preventing a bloody tragedy. Some people were arrested on the spot, but all but twelve were soon released. The police are currently on high alert because tomorrow is the opening day of the new parliament, and there are rumors that the National Socialist Party has plans for a large demonstration. There are also claims that the party's parliamentarians will violate previous bans by wearing Thug Party uniforms to attend.</p>

<p>Simla, December 12 (Reuters) - The Gazette reports that the Northwest Frontier tribes have been quiet for several weeks, but the Afridis have not yet been subdued. Although the commissioner of the Frontier Province convened a meeting of tribal chiefs, the tribe has not indicated their intention to attend. Furthermore, peaceable civilians traveling to North Waziristan have been driven back by armed insurgents. Therefore, in order to maintain order in the Kohat plain and protect North Waziristan and other border defenses, the Indian government has decided to build several military roads to eliminate the tribes' reliance on the roadless area between North Waziristan and the foothills.</p>

<p>Centered in Cochinchina and Annam</p>
<p>The Authorities Find Suppression Extremely Difficult</p>
<p>Hanoi, September 30 (Pacific Special Dispatch) - The revolt of the Vietnamese Communist Party first occurred in Annam this spring, especially in northern Annam. In Cochinchina, it initially took the form of a peaceful demonstration to make various demands, but later clashed with public security personnel, resulting in a bloody tragedy. Therefore, from Cochinchina to Annam, the revolutionary nature became increasingly clear. There were no longer any so-called demands, only disturbances. Government offices and police barracks were besieged by crowds.</p>
<p>Public places, schools, and bridges were destroyed. The residences of local gentry were burned and looted. What was particularly egregious was that the residents of Tonkin, who were deeply devoted to Buddhism, actually burned temples, killed monks, or abused them, and extorted money from them, showing that the theory of retribution was not credible. This was the plan originally set by the Communist Party leaders, which was gradually implemented by the ignorant people. Since August 31st, on September 1st, 8th, 9th, 12th, 13th, and up to the present, disturbances have occurred from time to time. The</p>
<p>duped villagers would drink until they were drunk, and then gather crowds of five hundred to one thousand people, sometimes as many as eight thousand, holding hoes, spears, rattan whips, and other items, led by Soviet Russian red flags, and commanded by their leaders, engaging in rebellion. The so-called leaders were all Vietnamese who had committed crimes, some of whom had returned from China or Siam, and some from Moscow. Coupled with the remote terrain and blocked transportation, these people acted recklessly, and the suppression was extremely difficult. Currently, the Vietnamese government and the Vietnamese royal family have decided to deal with the situation strictly. Whenever there is a mass riot, they will issue a warning by firing their guns as a matter of course. If they do not listen and disperse, they will follow with rifle fire. When necessary, they will even drop bombs from airplanes. At the same time, Annam and Cochinchina will seal off the areas where the rebels are gathered, and another</p>
<p>contingent of military police will be dispatched to investigate each village and town one by one. This is currently in progress.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Chairman Chiang's Thesis <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Consolidate Unity and Ensure Peace</p>
<p>Revealing the Two Meanings for the Whole Country to Abide By</p>
<p>Nanjing Telegram - Chairman Chiang published an article on the 13th entitled "Consolidating Unity and Ensuring Peace." It reads as follows:</p>
<p>The purpose of the National Revolution is to eliminate the warlords who bring disaster to the country, establish national unity, and implement the Three Principles of the People to advance China toward freedom and equality. This meaning is clear and known to everyone. Since the completion of the Northern Expedition, the National Government has proclaimed peaceful unification as an unchangeable policy. The people of the whole country, fearful of the war disasters that have followed since the founding of the Republic of China, are all looking forward to and supporting its realization. However, as the demobilization resolutions were just beginning to be implemented, the rebellious traces of ambitious military men were immediately revealed. From the Gui Clique's rebellion to the recent rebellions of Yan and Feng, they arose one after another, successively and fiercely, noisy and disturbing, lasting for two years. The government had no choice but to suppress the chaos to stop the chaos, and the people had no choice but to sacrifice the price to seek peace. Fortunately, the great righteousness has penetrated deep into the hearts of the people, and the soldiers are all bravely serving their lives. An unprecedented turmoil was finally quelled, and the sea and land were reunited, and peace reappeared. This war has, on the one hand, proved that our party's ideological policy truly conforms to the requirements of the whole country and that all those who seize military power and undermine unity, no matter how stubbornly they combine, will inevitably be defeated. On the other hand, it has made us aware that peace and unity are not two separate things, but are actually interconnected. Therefore, without consolidating unity, it is impossible to ensure peace, and without the whole country unanimously understanding the true meaning of peace, it is impossible to consolidate the unity of the country. In view of the eagerness of the people of the whole country for good governance, I would like to take this opportunity, at the end of this war, to first clarify this meaning to our compatriots. In modern countries, only international relations can speak of war and peace. If a country's organization is sound, there will only be the suppression of rebellions and no civil wars of mutual conflict. The so-called domestic peace is characterized by clear discipline and strong public opinion, which can use the power of the state to suppress rebellions before they take shape. Otherwise, the name of peace will have no foundation. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the people's pursuit of peace and the incomplete elimination of the revolution have allowed the warlords to flourish, each possessing their own army and territory, competing for power, and plunging the country into fragmentation. In addition, with the public opinion not being expressed, unscrupulous politicians were able to act arbitrarily and cause confusion, which allowed the struggles between groups to become a recurring story. Losing their way and forgetting to return, they regarded it as normal. Even in recent years, after the completion of unification, this absurd misconception is still deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Even in the past two years, the central government's conquest to ensure peaceful unification has been regarded by domestic intellectuals as no different from struggles between factions. Unable to distinguish between obedience and rebellion, between good and evil, if this is not corrected, when will the national policy be determined, and how can the guarantee of peace be achieved? I deeply believe in the urgency of the people's desire for peace and seek a way to ensure peace, and I believe that the following two meanings must be deeply understood and observed by all compatriots. What are the two meanings? First, in political measures, the central government must accommodate the opinions of the people as much as possible within the scope of not violating the party's Three Principles of the People's founding principles, but it must not allow the use of force under the guise of name. Second, the foundation of unity must be maintained by the state with all its strength, and no army should be allowed to cause any slight damage. Unity is the element of a country, and the army is the force of a country. The National Revolutionary Army sacrificed countless soldiers, and its most significant achievement was to destroy individual forces and establish national forces to complete the foundation of unity. Since it is the force of the state, it should only be used for the benefit of the state. Violating this meaning is an act of rebellion. This is a very simple truth that even a three-year-old child can understand. However, the bad habits of the warlords have spread and followed each other, like toxic bacteria lurking, and they will erupt with a touch. As in the current war to suppress rebellion, all parties participating in the rebellion have actually followed the old habits of usurpation and territorial division, with unspeakable ulterior motives. They falsely accuse the country, exaggerate and embellish their words, and at the beginning of the war, they relied on the beautiful name of military remonstrance to coerce the central government. Common, fickle politicians and traitors of the party and state then took advantage of this. The people failed to see through their conspiracies early and only blamed the central government for undue tolerance, believing that peace should not be easily broken. The disaster broke out and almost became irrecoverable. In fact, whether the rebels usurp power or not, they do not have the interests of the country in mind. Even if they have genuine views on national affairs, but they use the form of armed forces, the discipline is destroyed, and the losses are great. Where can the foundation of unity be entrusted? If the people are ignorant of this meaning and only pray for peace day and night, it is like climbing a tree to catch fish, and only see their pitifulness. Furthermore, our party follows the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, implementing political tutelage on the one hand to cultivate a strong democracy and consolidate the foundation of the Republic of China. At the same time, for the important national policies, it has always been with a public-spirited mind toward the world and praying for the cooperation of the people of the whole country. Public and private documents are available for inspection. There has never been any intention to shut the door and refuse participation of the people or refuse to accept public opinion. What it firmly believes and insists on for the people to abide by together is only the fundamental principles of the Three People's Principles and the strategies and steps shown in the teachings of the Premier, which are considered essential for nation-building and are not allowed to be discussed. Freedom of speech cannot involve the national system. This is a common rule in modern countries and should also be understood and sympathized with by all discerning scholars in the country. I believe that the biggest obstacle to domestic unrest is the elimination of traditional concepts and the failure to establish the center of thought. If it is believed that rebels can confront the central government, then the foundation of unity will be shaken. If it is believed that harming the foundation of the country is a kind of political struggle, then permanent peace will not be guaranteed. Now that the bitter experience has been vast, the people are in distress and the country is in crisis, waiting to be saved. At the beginning of this great suppression of the rebellion, there should be a thought of treading on frost and ice. Therefore, I have fully discussed the great reason why unity and peace are interconnected and the necessary conditions for its realization and have earnestly stated it to my compatriots. My compatriots should know that the people are all related to the joys and sorrows of the country. If they regard it as a matter of indifference, they will be evading their heavenly duty. From now on, regarding national political measures, as long as they do not violate the principles of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings, I hope that they will change from private discussions on the sidelines to honest criticisms. Whether it is to correct shortcomings or elaborate on opinions, the central government will be open to suggestions, choose the good and follow it. If they contribute their talents and efforts and are willing to share difficulties, then selection of talented and capable people will not be restricted by any one rule. For national unity, it is even more necessary for the whole country to be united and to use the pure public opinion of the people to provide strong support. If there are politicians who harm the country with their deceptive words and incite the military to gradually rebel, seize the central government, and undermine unity, regardless of the size of the matter, they must be punished by the strictest laws and regulations and not be treated with leniency.</p>
<p>To accept the strengths of all to achieve a common will, and to reform the rules to prevent the use of force is the only way to guarantee peace. I believe that the most important thing at present is to consolidate the unity of the country. Therefore, everything that can be treated with leniency, and the actions that undermine unity cannot be forgiven. Everything can be tolerated, and the path to endangering the foundation of the country must not be opened. This is what I have always cherished, and what I will continue to strive for in the future is nothing more than this. In the past, I did not care about any sacrifices to consolidate unity, and in the future, I will not make any sacrifices to guarantee peace.</p>
<p>I only believe that consolidating unity is the only mission to complete the National Revolution, and ensuring peace is the greatest responsibility of the National Government. Therefore, I will devote all my efforts to achieve this goal of consolidating unity and ensuring peace. Zhuge Liang said, "I will exhaust myself to the utmost, even to my death." I am the same, and I am willing to offer my foolish loyalty to repay the party and the country. However, because this matter is so important, I have taken the liberty of explaining it to my compatriots in detail.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Memorial Week at the Central Government and National Government <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held its 81st weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 AM on October 13th in the auditorium. In attendance were Central Committee members Li Shizeng, Cai Yuanpei, Wu Jingheng, Hu Hanmin, Wang Zhengting, Li Wenfan, Chen Lifu, Chen Bulei, Kexinge, and approximately five to six hundred staff members from various ministries and departments, as well as guests. Wu Jingheng presided over the ceremony. After the formalities, Wang Zhengting delivered a report, stating briefly: The rebellion of Yan and Feng this time is a misunderstanding of the Three People's Principles. The Premier's sole principle lies in</p>
<p>enabling the Republic of China to stand on equal footing in the world. He dedicated himself to this for forty years as if it were one day. The Yan-Feng rebellion can be said to be against China's freedom and equality, hoping to collude with foreign powers to preserve their separatist forces and rights. In terms of global trends, for a country that is divided into four or five parts to stand on equal footing with other unified countries is like trying to find fish in trees. For several months, due to the Yan-Feng rebellion, the pain and losses suffered by the country and the people, and the</p>
<p>sacrifices made by our front-line soldiers, are truly distressing. Fortunately, Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek led extremely loyal armed comrades to quell the great disaster. The heads of various branches of government have worked hard in the rear to maintain the interdependent relationship between politics and the military, enabling smooth progress. Peaceful unification has already been 80 or 90 percent successful, which is a great blessing for the future of the Republic of China. From the perspective of diplomacy, to achieve national freedom and equality, it is necessary to first achieve the consolidation and unification of the government. Now that the opportunity for unification has arrived, it depends on the united efforts of all the people to assist the government. As citizens, they must know that the strength of a country does not only rely on the vastness of its land and the multitude of its people. Because if the land is large, there will be people coveting its resources, easily provoking aggressive intentions. If there is no strong government to protect it, the dangers are many. In the past hundred years, China's diplomatic failures have put it in a state of constant panic. Therefore, the Premier loudly appealed to awaken the people and arouse their patriotism to preserve the legacy of our ancestors for more than four thousand years, as well as the historical and cultural</p>
<p>glory. The path that a country should take to achieve strength lies in being able to apply good diplomatic policies, especially in being able to</p>
<p>recognize the direction of world trends, and which countries treat us well and can treat us equally, and which countries adopt aggressive policies towards us and do not treat us equally. Those who can treat us equally, we should regard as good friends. Those who do not treat us equally, we should plan appropriate countermeasures. Take Russia, for example. That country shares a border with our country, and its domestic situation is similar to ours. It seems that it should have very good friendship with our country. Why is the relationship not good and diplomatic relations have not been restored to this day? Because it adopts the Third International ideology, trying to overthrow politics and human happiness around the world, wanting to assimilate China with it, imitating its actions of killing, arson, and creating a world of terror, and constantly causing trouble in China. What friendship is there to speak of? In addition, there are one or two countries that have no ambition to invade China's territory, but use commercial warfare tactics to seize China's economic power, leading to inevitable conflicts of interest. Regarding consular jurisdiction, if they are unwilling to give it up, they are using this unequal system to allow</p>
<p>businesses operating in China to pay less or not pay all the taxes owed to China, giving them a superior position in trade with China. Also, a country that shares our language and ethnicity seems to have better friendship with our country, but conflicts are still inevitable. Because their domestic politicians and newspaper writers are ignorant of world trends, thinking that once China becomes strong, they will be in danger. They often use our warlords to fuel our internal strife, making it impossible for the country to unify. This is a huge mistake on their part. It is hoped that they can realize this soon, improve their attitude, and join hands to advance towards the realm of strength. The most important key to diplomacy now is to recover our country's consular jurisdiction. If this can be achieved, then the work of abolishing unequal treaties will have been largely successful. Some people once</p>
<p>thought that tariff autonomy and the abolition of consular jurisdiction are equally</p>
<p>difficult. In fact, with tariff autonomy, although import goods slightly increase the burden, the ultimate bearers are the Chinese people. As the saying goes, "the wool comes from the sheep's back," the increased burden is still on the Chinese. Therefore, there is no strong opposition. However, consular jurisdiction is related to their commercial interests in China, so they are unwilling to give it up easily. The government is currently researching methods and actively proceeding, hoping that the people will unite as the government's backing to achieve this goal as soon as possible. As for the embassies of various countries, their failure to move to the capital not only causes various inconveniences in diplomacy, but also shows that various countries do not have sufficient respect for our government. No country in the world has a foreign embassy located a thousand miles away from the capital. Recently, the bogus government in Beiping (Beijing) dared to form, and they cannot help but think that having the embassies in Beiping can be used for help. The embassies may also think that the political situation in Beiping is more convenient. It is hoped that the government will conduct research and preparation so that the embassies can be moved south as soon as possible. The report concluded, and the meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>On the same morning at 10:00 AM, the National Government held its weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. In attendance were Chiang Kai-shek, Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Wang Boqun, Wang Xiling, He Yaozu, Jiang Menglin, Wang Zhengting, Yi Peiji, Zhang Nanxian, Zhu Lühe, Lin Xiang, Wei Daoming, Liu Ruiheng, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Yu, Zhang Wohua, Zhu Jingnong, Wang Jiazhen, Zhou Yawei, Wu Siyu, and all staff members from the two offices of the National Government, totaling over three hundred people. After President Chiang performed the rituals, he gave a political report: "Today, I will briefly report on the past military situation and the future policy direction of the government. The progress of the suppression of the rebellion over the past six months has already been reported in detail. The number of deaths and injuries in this suppression of the rebellion is approximately 95,000. Countless others whose numbers cannot be verified are not included. As for the rebel army, the number of deaths and injuries must be increased by at least one-third. The total number should be above 150,000. Approximately one-third of our side died, and approximately two-thirds were injured. The rebel side had about half deaths and half injuries. According to investigations, there are already over 80,000 wounded rebel soldiers in Zhengzhou, Zhangde, and Luoyang. Other locations are not included. At the beginning of the war, we thought that Feng said he had 270,000 troops, and Yan said he had 150,000 troops, which were exaggerations. But after investigation, Feng's army was indeed more than 270,000. Because Feng recruited more than 100,000 soldiers when the war started. Feng's total army was about 400,000, and Yan's total army was about 200,000. Although Feng's and Yan's armies were numerous, they did not have enough firearms. Therefore, only one-fourth of their troops used guns, and most of the rest used broadswords and spears. Therefore, the rebel army had more casualties than us. Therefore, the total number of deaths and injuries in this battle should be over 300,000. Such a great sacrifice, whether it is our army or the enemy army, all belong to Chinese soldiers. And the enemy officers and soldiers all understand that these deaths and injuries are</p>
<p>extremely unjustified. Therefore, they are unwilling to fight in the future. As for the people in the war zone, countless people starved to death or came close to death, and the losses of houses and food are incalculable. The great sacrifice this time, in short, is to seek China's unification and truly achieve lasting peace. Now that the military has ended, the government's responsibility is only to consolidate unification and ensure peace</p>
<p>to fulfill the government's mission and responsibility. From now on, we will strive for leniency in politics. No matter what political views anyone has, as long as they do not violate the Three People's Principles and the Outline of National Reconstruction, they are free. We should try to accommodate public opinion as much as possible. Even those who previously had different political views from the government, if they do not use the military to undermine unification and peace, and have correct views, can also be accommodated as much as possible. As for the military aspect, we must strive for organization. If anyone provokes the military and causes domestic war, whether they are politicians or warlords, they will be punished as counter-revolutionaries and will not be forgiven. It is hoped that government colleagues will understand that the price paid for this sacrifice is to consolidate unification and ensure peace, and everyone should follow this intention to accomplish the mission and achieve the goal." The report concluded, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e68">The Situation in Henan After the Zhengzhou Conference <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>He Yingqin Appointed to Preside Over the Zhengzhou Headquarters</p>
<p>70,000 Feng Troops Disarmed and Will Be Reorganized Urgent dispatch from Hankou: After the recapture of Zhengzhou, Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek moved his headquarters from Kaifeng to Zhengzhou in order to quickly resolve the situation in Henan. He convened a meeting of various generals, including the director of the Wuhan Headquarters, He Yingqin; the commander of the Second Army Corps, Liu Zhi; the commander of the Third Army Corps, He Chengjun; the commander of the Sixteenth Route Army, Xu Yuanquan; the commander of the Twenty-first Route Army, Xia Douyin; as well as Shangguan Yunxiang, Hao Mengling, and Xiao Zhichu, and other senior generals. They held consecutive meetings on the 7th and 8th. It is heard that the main decisions were: (1) To thoroughly resolve the remnants of the Feng army besieged near Xinzheng, and to eliminate the remaining enemies and miscellaneous troops in Henan; (2) To appoint He Yingqin as the director of the Zhengzhou Headquarters, with He Guoguang as the chief of staff, responsible for handling the situation in Henan; (3) To transfer He Chengjun to the director of the Wuhan Headquarters, drawing troops to engage in bandit suppression in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi; (4) To order Liu Zhi to quickly organize the Henan Provincial Government, investigate the disaster victims, provide effective relief, and handle the aftermath; (5) To transfer heavy troops to assist General Commander Yang Hucheng in attacking Luoyang. At that time, the divisions of Xu Yuanquan and Xiao Zhichu had been reassigned to the left wing. Xiao's division recaptured Dengfeng on the 6th, and Xu's division recaptured Luoyang on the 9th. Yang's army also occupied Xin'an. The area south of the Yellow River is completely under the control of the Central Army. As for the Feng army near Xinzheng, led by Zhang Weixi, Tian Jinkai, Feng Zhi'an, Ren Yingqi, Deng Baoshan, Shi Zhenqing, Tian Chunjie, Wang Hemin, Ni Yusheng, Zhao Fenglin, and others, numbering no less than eighty or ninety thousand, since their retreat route had been cut off, they were fully disarmed by the Central Army at dawn on the 8th. By the completion of the disarmament on the 9th, more than eight thousand people had been captured, along with approximately seven thousand guns, more than two hundred artillery pieces, and more than a thousand machine guns. The remaining Jin army on the south bank of the Yellow River, estimated to be about two regiments, was also disarmed. Others, such as Ji Hongchang, Liang Guanying, and Zhang Yinxiang, all led their troops to surrender and resumed their military positions. In summary, the Feng army suffered extremely heavy losses in this campaign and had no ability to re-enter Henan. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek returned to Nanjing by plane on the 9th, leaving He Yingqin to be stationed in Zhengzhou. He Chengjun also approached Hubei on the 11th. Except for a portion remaining in Hankou, the staff of the headquarters are scheduled to go north in batches on the 12th and 13th. Regarding the troops transferred back to suppress bandits, He Chengjun said in Hankou that it would be six divisions and three brigades, but the exact number is unknown. (October 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">He Chengjun Returns to Hankou from Zhengzhou <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Dingwen Arrives Together and Returns Home for Mourning</p>
<p>He Appointed Concurrently as Director of the Wuhan Headquarters</p>
<p>Six Divisions and One Brigade Head South to Undertake Bandit Suppression Urgent dispatch from Hankou: He Chengjun, the commander of the Third Army Corps, was ordered to take charge of the Pinghan Railway line operations. After several months of hard work, he repeatedly achieved successes. Now that the task of handling the situation in Henan has been assigned to He Yingqin stationed in Zhengzhou, he was specifically transferred back to Hubei to take charge of provincial affairs and concurrently serve as the director of the Wuhan Headquarters, commanding the bandit suppression affairs in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. He set off from Zhengzhou at 10:00 AM on the 11th with Jiang Dingwen, the commander of the Second Army, by plane. They arrived in Hankou at 2:00 PM that afternoon. Representatives from various agencies and organizations welcomed them at the Wangjiadun Airport, including the acting chairman of the provincial government, Wu Xingya; the director of the Finance Department, Zhang Guanshi; the director of the Construction Department, Fang Dazhi; the director of the Education Department, Huang Jianzhong; committee members Xie Lü, Peng Jieshi, and Xiong Bingkun; the mayor of Hankou City, Liu Wendao; the counselors of the Headquarters, Leng Xin and Wang Shi; the committee members of the provincial party headquarters, Zuo Duo and Yu Yuzhi; the committee members of the municipal party headquarters, Liu Yun and Bi Ruoxu; as well as the commander of the Twenty-first Route Army, Xia Douyin; the commander of the Fifty-first Division, Fan Shisheng; the commander of the Thirteenth Division, Zhu Huaibing; the chief of staff of the Garrison Command, Ye Peng; the fortress commander, Yin Zusheng, and other students from various schools, totaling more than five thousand people. The Guerrilla Brigade of the Garrison Command, the Water Police Bureau, and the Third Security Brigade were responsible for security. At 2:00 PM, the plane arrived and landed. After He and Jiang disembarked, they greeted the welcomers one by one. He went to the Third Army Corps' garrison office, and Jiang went to Liu Qiyan's private residence, where they separately met with guests. They immediately telegraphed Nanjing to Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek and Shenyang to Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang, as well as telegraphing the director of the Zhengzhou Headquarters, He Yingqin, reporting their arrival in Hankou. When He and Jiang disembarked, the reporters immediately presented their cards to pay their respects and had brief talks with them, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>He Chengjun said briefly: "I have been ordered to suppress the rebellion, operating on the Pinghan and Longhai lines for seven months. Fortunately, with the prestige of the Central Government, the remaining enemies have been gradually eliminated. The Longhai front has reached Lanfeng and Kaifeng, and the right wing of the Pinghan line has fortunately been successful. The left wing has also successively occupied Luoyang and Xin'an. The central route has recaptured Zhengzhou and Xinzheng. The Feng army in Henan has been completely annihilated. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek returned to Nanjing on the 9th and entrusted the responsibility of handling the situation in Henan and ending the war to Director He Yingqin, establishing the Zhengzhou Headquarters to handle military aftermath. The position of director of the Wuhan Headquarters is entrusted to my brothers to temporarily take charge. After returning to Hankou, my first task is to continue after Director He to handle the pacification of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, with the aim of completely eliminating bandits and communists within three months, so that the people can live and work in peace. As for the troops responsible for pacification, in addition to the original garrison troops, Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek has approved the transfer of large forces from the front lines to the south. As for the Hubei Provincial Government, because I have been serving on the front lines, I have been unable to take care of it. Fortunately, with the acting chairmanship of Director Wu Xingya and the efforts of various committee members, there have been no shortcomings. In the future, I will continue to work with Director Wu and the committee members to achieve the goal of political prosperity and the happiness of the people."</p>
<p>Jiang Dingwen said briefly: "I was previously stationed in Wuhan and received the support of all sectors. The relationship between the military and the people was extremely harmonious. When Yan and Feng rebelled, and the Central Government used Zhang for punishment, my troops were ordered to participate in the war, first opening the Pinghan line, and then transferred to the Longhai line. After dozens of battles, large and small, we repeatedly defeated stubborn enemies. When the fighting was fierce, my father died of illness in my hometown. Military affairs detained me, and I was unable to return home. Now, most of the Yan rebel army has been eliminated. A part of the Feng rebel army has been disarmed by our army, and a part has surrendered to our army. Units such as Ji Hongchang and Liang Guanying have all been reorganized in accordance with orders and transferred to the Guangshan and Gushi areas to undertake bandit suppression. From then on, domestic warlords can be expected to be eliminated, and the Central Government's policy of peaceful unification can be realized. I took this opportunity to present a request to Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek to return home for mourning. I will stay in Hankou for one day and tomorrow morning (the 12th) will</p>
<p>take a plane to Nanjing and then to Zhejiang." (October 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Han Fuqu Sends Representatives to Pan <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Dispatch from Jinan: Shandong Province Chairman Han Fuqu has now sent Director of the Agriculture and Mines Department Wang Fangting as his representative to Shenyang to negotiate important matters with the Northeast Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xueliang. Wang has already taken several attendants and soldiers and gone north. The reporter visited Wang on the train. Wang said that Chairman Han immediately wanted to send a representative to Shenyang after responding to Commander Zhang's clever telegram to exchange views. Recently, Commander-in-Chief Wang Xiangting (Wang Changyu) was ordered by Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek to be a representative to Pan. Han Wang had a very close relationship with Wang and had invited him by telegram to pass through Jinan on the way, but Commander Wang passed through Qingdao due to time constraints, so he went directly to Dalian and then to Shenyang. Recently, a telegram came from Shenyang saying that they were waiting in Shenyang and asked to send a representative to meet and talk. The chairman appointed me as a representative because I am an old friend of Wang. It is expected that I will stay in Shenyang for two weeks. When the reporter asked about the mission of this trip, Wang said that it was a normal reciprocation and that there was</p>
<p>no so-called mission. However, according to other sources, Shandong and the Northeast need to exchange views with the Northeast authorities and make practical connections on the issue of the Qingdao naval defense area and the joint defense between Dezhou and Sangyuan in northern Shandong. This is one of the missions Wang is responsible for. Also, Shi Yousan's troops have surrendered to the Central Government. Shi recently sent a telegram to Han, expressing deep regret for the past and expressing his willingness to listen to Han's command and asking him to intercede with the Central Government. In terms of Han's friendship with Shi, Han cannot but make an effort. However, Shi's troops have now retreated to Hebei Province and have entered the Northeast defense area. In the future, if the Central Government allows the request and Shi's troops are transferred, it is necessary to contact the Northeast to avoid misunderstandings. This is also one of Wang's missions.</p>
<h3 id="e71">The Tragedy of the "Da Guangdong" Steamer in Shantou <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>One Chinese Worker Killed and Six Injured</p>
<p>All Sectors Resolve on Five Negotiation Methods Dispatch from Shantou: The French steamer "Da Guangdong" arrived in Shantou Port from Saigon on the 3rd. While anchoring, the partners of various inns in Shantou City boarded boats one after another to greet merchants, using bamboo hooks to climb onto the side of the steamer. The French owner of the "Da Guangdong" steamer initially ordered Annamese sailors to open water hoses to spray the inn partners, and then directed the sailors to beat Cai Yuqin, a partner of the Yi Hua Inn, to death and throw the body into the sea, and beat worker Deng Diangui and six others, who are now receiving treatment at the Municipal Hospital. Fortunately, when the incident occurred, the water police immediately boarded the ship to mediate, rescued the injured Chinese workers, and detained the Chinese comprador Chen Xianghe. According to Chen Xianghe's confession at the police station, the above-mentioned incident did occur on the day the ship arrived, but it had nothing to do with him personally. After this case occurred, the French Consul stationed in Shantou, Ouren, repeatedly asked the municipal government to release Chen Xianghe, but the municipal government refused to release him temporarily until the case was properly resolved. The Shantou branch of the Guangdong General Labor Union telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 5th, requesting that a serious negotiation be proposed to France and ordering all workers to stop working on the ship to avoid danger. Therefore, the ship repeatedly raised flags in Shantou to ask for fresh water and unload goods, but no Chinese workers responded. On the 4th, French Consul Ouren again negotiated with the municipal government, claiming that Cai Yuqin's death was due to his accidental hooking of the iron handle, injuring his head and falling into the sea, and that the workers were also injured by being sprayed by water hoses. The municipal government then sent Secretary Rao Shiyi to invite Ouren to personally visit the Municipal Hospital to examine the injured, proving that they were indeed injured by iron bars, and the bruises had not faded. The French Consul instructed the injured to take good care of themselves, and all medical expenses would be borne by him. Yesterday, a joint meeting of various labor unions in Shantou resolved on five items: (1) Punish the murderer; (2) Formally apologize to our government; (3) Compensate the injured for medical expenses; (4) Compensate the families of the deceased for pensions; (5) The French Consul should guarantee that this will not happen again in the future. After the resolution, the municipal government was requested to negotiate with the French Consul. Also, before this case is resolved, the "Da Guangdong" steamer cannot leave Shantou. French Consul Ouren sent a letter to the municipal government, stating that the "Da Guangdong" steamer suffered heavy losses due to its stay in Shantou, and specifically asked the municipal government to release the ship first, and he was willing to be responsible for a clear settlement. The "Da Guangdong" steamer then left Shantou for Hong Kong on the 5th. On the 6th, Cai Yuqin's body floated up on the opposite bank of Mashiyu at the Shantou port mouth. The body has been recovered and examined by the authorities before being submitted for negotiation. Currently, all sectors in Shantou are extremely indignant. The Shantou branch of the Guangdong General Labor Union is scheduled to convene a representative conference of all labor unions in the city at the Municipal Party Department Auditorium on the 7th to discuss everything in order to achieve the above-mentioned five requirements.

<h3 id="e72">Wu Chao-shu's Speech at the League of Nations <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Geneva Dispatch: During the Eleventh International League Assembly this year, Mr. Wu Chao-shu, the Chinese envoy, delivered a lengthy speech at the Assembly on September 16. The original text is recorded below.</p>
<p>As the time for concluding the discussion of the report draws near, I shall speak briefly. However, before discussing the League's work report for the past year, I must fulfill my duty of expressing grief. China deeply regrets the passing of Lord Balfour (former British Prime Minister), Mr. Stresemann (former German Foreign Minister), and Mr. Nansen (former Norwegian explorer). These three were great figures of the League, dedicated to the cause of peace, the aims of the League of Nations, and humanitarianism. Their contributions were immense. Now that these wise men have passed away, it is not only a loss to their nations but also a misfortune for the League and the world.</p>
<p>In the past year, cooperation between China and the League in matters of public health has been realized, with particular attention to port sanitation, ship inspection, and medical education. This cooperation has gradually shown good results. The personnel dispatched to China by the League have been very helpful. Regarding the mutual reporting of information on various diseases, China has also cooperated with the Far Eastern Health Bureau established by the League's Health Section in Singapore. All of this represents the initial tangible cooperation between our government and the League, which is sufficient to arouse China's attention to the League and increase China's confidence that the League can assist its member states with sincerity and integrity.</p>
<p>This year's Assembly should discuss the important issue of reorganizing the Secretariat. I take this opportunity to express my admiration for Sir Eric Drummond, the Secretary-General, for his outstanding talent and diligence in serving the League since its establishment. The loyalty and achievements of other officials in the Secretariat are also commendable. Since the founding of the League, its work has greatly increased, as has the work of the Secretariat. However, the organization of the Secretariat has not progressed in tandem with the expansion of its work. Therefore, if criticisms of the Secretariat's organization from various quarters, both inside and outside the Secretariat, are justified, the Chinese delegation will consider them together with the delegations of other countries to ensure that its organization is as efficient as its staff.</p>
<p>Another important matter to be studied by this Assembly is the amendment of the Covenant to align it with the Pact of Paris (Kellogg-Briand Pact). This pact is inextricably linked to the names of French Foreign Minister Briand and former U.S. Secretary of State Kellogg. Ten years since the Covenant came into effect, member states believe that all clauses related to war in the Covenant should and must be deleted. This demonstrates the progress of peace. I firmly believe that this move is very important, and I believe we can congratulate each other. China participated in the work of the committee to amend the Covenant, and its report is now before you. China naturally approves of the amendment. We also hope that the amendment can be implemented as soon as possible. If implemented, observing the Covenant and the Pact of Paris working in concert is truly interesting and enlightening. The Pact provides moral encouragement to the Covenant, while the Covenant provides substantive force and backing to the Pact.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to discuss the plan for a European Union. This plan is also closely linked to French Foreign Minister Briand. As a non-European and representing a country whose area, population, and complexity of problems are equal to those of all of Europe, speaking from this position, the Chinese delegation believes that the plan for a European Union and the League of Nations need not be inherently incompatible. If a European Union is successfully established, it can only be a local or regional agreement within the framework of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The Chinese delegation also believes that a European Union does not inherently conflict with non-European countries or groups of non-European countries. I was very interested in the speech given by Austrian Chancellor Schober some days ago on the issue of a European Union. Chancellor Schober proposed that this plan should first be implemented in groups of European countries, and then the groups should merge to achieve the goal of a pan-European Union. If this idea is ultimately adopted, I would like to extrapolate on future developments. Countries can combine themselves into groups, as Chancellor Schober argued, and these groups can then be united again in due course. The reasons for this are generally geographical, ethnic, cultural, and economic. Their organization may be for relief purposes, political purposes, or both. I dare not predict the number or names of these unions at this time. However, a European Union would certainly be one of them. Furthermore, if these unions were to solidify into an all-encompassing entity, a great world federation, would that be a fantasy? I would like to translate and recite a chapter from a Chinese classic for you. This chapter expresses the ideal of Confucius 2,400 years ago, which is still relevant to our discussion today. Confucius said: "When the Great Way prevails, the world is for all. The virtuous and capable are selected. Sincerity is cultivated, and harmony is promoted. People do not cherish only their own parents, nor do they love only their own children. The elderly are provided for until their end, the strong are employed, the young are nurtured to grow, and the widowed, orphaned, lonely, and disabled are all cared for. Men have spouses, and women have homes. People despise the waste of resources but do not hoard them for themselves. They detest the lack of effort but do not exert it solely for their own benefit. Therefore, conspiracies are suppressed and do not arise, and theft and banditry do not occur, so outer doors are not closed. This is called the Great Unity." This chapter was written in the sixth century B.C. Up to the present, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China, has repeatedly emphasized it. This is not a utopian ideal. Consider, twenty years ago, who could have dreamed that more than fifty countries would have a permanent meeting in Geneva, with a permanent Secretariat? Two years ago, how many people could have foreseen that responsible politicians from twenty-seven countries would be discussing the plan for a European Union, not the question of whether it was possible, but how to realize it? However, please do not be alarmed. I am not proposing a plan for a world federation. I merely wish to suggest something to you. Among our friends, one person may build a house with one floor for his own use. Later, as his circumstances improve and his family grows, he plans to add several more floors to it. He consults an architect, who says that the foundation of the original house is too weak to support the added building and must be completely rebuilt from the ground up. I now suggest to you, who are the architects of the European Union, do not repeat this mistake. When you build the European Union, do not only consider today's needs, but also plan for future use. Lay a foundation that is deep, broad, and solid so that future builders can continue to add floors, not only to accommodate the European Union but also the unions of other continents. Then the principle of the Great Unity of humankind will be within reach.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Fast Mail from Hangzhou <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, businesses are settling accounts. The Hangzhou silver and banking industries have reached an agreement to comply with this, and have sent notices to various industries.

<p>Robberies in Lüxiang and Langxia (1) On the evening of the 11th of this month, around 8 PM, about fifty to sixty bandits suddenly arrived in Lüxiang, all armed with guns. After arriving in the town, they immediately divided into sections to guard the area and successively robbed shops.

(2) On the same evening, about twenty bandits arrived in Langxia. The biggest loss was suffered by Tongtai Rice Shop, and one apprentice (from Songyin) was killed.

<p>Telephone Price Increase Resolved The Suzhou Telephone Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Communications to increase the monthly telephone rental fee by two yuan starting in September. After receiving the order, Director Zhao immediately notified the General Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce then convened a meeting of representatives from various industries to discuss the matter and submitted a request to the Ministry to temporarily waive the increase. After repeated visits to the Ministry of Communications, the approval was denied. Therefore, the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Director Zhao Chuanyu to discuss the matter, assuming that they would be allowed to increase the fee by one yuan per month. However, the Ministry disapproved again. Director Zhao then went to Beijing recently to meet with Minister Wang in person, explaining the difficult situation of the business community. Minister Wang then approved a temporary increase of one yuan. Starting from January of the 20th year [of the Republic], the original agreement to increase the fee by two yuan must be followed. Currently, the Suzhou Telephone Bureau has received orders to issue receipts and collect fees from users.</p>

<p>Bandits Harassing the Northern Township The Shangyan Village in the first district of the northern township of Wujin has more than eighty households and is equipped with two self-defense rifles and one pistol. At about 6 PM on the evening of the 10th, Lu Dahai and Zhou Gensheng, the bandit leaders from Tianguo Village and Zhoujiatou (Jiangyin border) near the village, joined forces with Gao Xiaosheng and Yang Xiaoda, the bandit leaders from the northern section, and led more than sixty bandits, each carrying guns, to Shang District Town, divided up the looting and also forcibly took away the hidden guns. At that time, Ge Qingda, the son of Ge Qingda, the head of Fucheng Township, was kidnapped. Before leaving, he instructed Ge Qingda to send four quick guns from the village to Guo Village at 6 AM on the 12th, and then his son would be released. During the robbery, villagers reported to the County Public Security Bureau. County Magistrate Wu immediately asked Regiment Commander Wu of the Military Police to send the Eighth Company of the Second Battalion and the Police Business Corps Patrol Team to pursue and suppress the bandits. When they arrived, the bandits had already retreated. Company Commander Fang Yongxiuquan immediately divided the teams into two branches, the first branch searched Guo Village, and the second branch searched Zhoujiatou. They set out at 5 AM on the 12th. In Guo Village, they captured eleven people with suspicious behavior, including Li Ronglin. In Zhoujiatou, the second branch captured five bandits, including Li Guochuan. During the search, gunshots were suddenly heard in the rice fields, and many bandits were seen crossing the river and fleeing. The soldiers and police immediately opened fire, and several bandits were hit. One bandit was shot in the head and fell into the river and died. The villagers fished him out, cut off his head, and asked Company Commander Fang to order the city to lead the way. Then, they also picked up a Mauser rifle left behind by the bandits and a large pile of clothes left behind when crossing the river, and all of them, together with the head, were sent to the city. After the bandits retreated, they invaded Pan City Town again at 12 PM on the 12th. Li Zongfan, the captain of the police detachment stationed in the town, immediately opened fire with them. Due to the disparity in numbers, squad leader Wang Baosheng was shot and killed, and squad member Wang Zhenhua was also injured. The team's bed tents, clothes, and other items were all burned down. A rifle was looted. Captain Li retreated to Longhutang and used the telephone to report to the county government.

<p>Electricity Please Investigate School Corporal Punishment Because the Jiaxing County Primary and Secondary Schools have ordered by the Education Bureau to hold joint sports events on October 16th and 17th, the schools have recently increased physical training and temporarily suspended self-study writing and other subjects to facilitate practice. However, most of the primary school students are not yet adults and cannot bear the hard work, so they have symptoms. The physical education teachers of the schools did not observe the physical strength of the students and drove them to do various sports. For example, Zhang Bingchu, the physical education teacher of Jianqiao County Primary School in the city, used rattan sticks to whip the students, causing the students to cry out in pain and the misery to be unbearable. Now, the family of the student who has been victimized has learned that the teacher's actions violate the principles of education and are too insulting to the students. They have telegraphed the Director of Education and Civil Affairs to investigate thoroughly. If Director Shen has no effective measures, Jiang will telegraph the Education Department to investigate thoroughly to emphasize humanity and maintain education.</p>

<p>The accounts will be checked together with the Audit Court. Teachers and staff telegraphed to request the speedy appointment of a president. Nanjing, 13th. The Ministry of Education is currently planning what method to use to receive the Labor University. However, it has asked the Audit Court to send personnel to jointly investigate the school's accounts.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the newspapers reported that the Ministry of Education would send people to receive and directly manage the Labor University for one year without appointing a president. The teachers and staff of the school believe that this kind of method is not the attitude that the educational authorities should take, so they telegraphed the Central Government and the founder of the school to express their opinions. The full text of the telegram is as follows: To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education, it is reported that the Ministry of Education will send people to receive and directly manage the Labor University for one year without appointing a president. This method has no precedent to follow and is easy to cause misunderstandings from the outside world. It does not seem to be the attitude that the educational administration authorities should have towards a national university. The teachers and students of Labor University feel uneasy and should cancel the receiving method and appoint a successor president immediately to take responsibility and avoid problems. The future of Labor Education is deeply beneficial. Cheng Ganyun, Peng Xiang, Ma Shouzhen, Li Wenying, Gong Xianming, Peng Jinyun, Hu Bin, and other teachers and staff of the Labor University, one hundred and fifty-one people, kowtowed together.</p>

However, because Mr. Chen's physical constitution is inherently weak and it is difficult for him to concurrently handle such busy duties for a long time, he has repeatedly requested Minister Jiang to allow him to resign from his concurrent position as director of the Department of Social Affairs so that he can concentrate on his duties as a counselor and fulfill his previous agreement (Mr. Chen, when taking on the concurrent position, expressed that he would temporarily act for two months and asked the minister to take his time to find a dedicated person to take on the position). Recently, it has been heard that Minister Jiang, considering Mr. Chen's sincere intention to resign, has internally decided to approve his resignation from his concurrent position as director of the Department of Social Affairs. As for the successor, it has also been internally decided that Yang Lian, who is currently inspecting education in Europe, will succeed to this position. He will soon submit a request to the Executive Yuan to be forwarded to the National Government for appointment. According to reports, Yang Lian is a graduate of Peking University and has served as the director of academic affairs at Zhejiang Provincial First Middle School. At the First National Education Conference, Mr. Yang represented Zhejiang Province and strongly advocated for the merger of normal schools, co-education, and the abolition of classical Chinese in elementary schools. Last winter, Zhejiang Province sent him to Europe and the United States to study education. After arriving in the United States, Mr. Yang majored in educational administration at Columbia University. He has now arrived in Europe for inspection and recently sent a telegram to the capital stating that he is expected to return to China in one or two months.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Fudan University 25th Anniversary Celebration <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>To be Held for Three Days Starting from the 16th Fudan University in Shanghai will hold its 25th anniversary celebration for three days starting on the 16th of this month. On the second day (the 17th), guests and alumni will be received at the university in Jiangwan in the morning, followed by a lunch. A ceremony will be held at 2 p.m. in the afternoon. The past history and current situation of the university are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>——Past History—— Seven years before the founding of the Republic of China, some teachers and students of the Aurora College, feeling that religious academics should not be confused, resolutely left the school and created Fudan Public School.</p>
<p>Zhou Fu, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, allocated the former Wusong Navy Commander's Office as the school site. The school was established in accordance with the regulations of the Qing Dynasty's higher schools, and Ma Liang was publicly appointed as the president. A middle school was also attached, and many scholars and Confucian scholars came to study at the time. Two years later, Yan Fu succeeded him. He then asked Governor-General Duanfang to approve the establishment of the school and allocate 2,000 yuan per month for official expenses. Later, Zhang Renjun succeeded as Governor-General of Liangjiang and reallocated more than 70 mu of official land in Wusong to prepare for the construction of school buildings, with Xia Jingguan as the president. After more than a year, Xia left and Gao Guqian, the Jiangsu Education Commissioner, succeeded him. A year later, Gao left and Ma Liang became president again. During this period, four classes graduated from the higher regular program, with a total of 57 graduates. During the Xinhai Revolution, the school buildings were borrowed by the Songhu Military Headquarters, and the students were scattered and the music stopped. In the first year of the Republic of China, Yu Youren, Hu Dunfu, and others from the alumni association traveled to Shanghai and Nanjing to jointly plan the restoration of the school. They submitted a request to the Nanjing Provisional Government to approve a subsidy of 10,000 yuan, and Cai Yuanpei, the Minister of Education, approved the establishment of the school. They also submitted a request to the authorities in Jiangsu and Shanghai to allocate the Li Gong Ancestral Hall in Xujiahui as the school site. Many people, including school directors Sun Yat-sen, Wang Liangchou, Chen Ying, and Cheng Xuelou, wholeheartedly supported the school. Ma Liang was still publicly appointed as the president. Later, Ma was summoned to Beijing, and Li Denghui, the former Dean of Academic Affairs, succeeded him. Renowned figures in Shanghai were then gathered to form a board of directors to provide assistance in various ways, which helped to maintain the school. Later, as the number of students increased day by day, it was decided to build school buildings and start a university. Since the official land in Wusong was not entirely suitable, more than 70 mu of land were successively purchased in Jiangwan, and enthusiastic supporters of education at home and abroad actively donated money. More than 300,000 yuan was collected successively. Several people independently donated money to build school buildings, such as Guo Zibin, who independently built the Zibin Yuan, worth more than 70,000 yuan, and the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, which independently built the Jian Gong Hall, worth more than 50,000 yuan. Huang Yizhu independently built a school building, worth more than 15,000 yuan. From June 9th to October 19th, dormitories, gymnasiums, libraries, sanatoriums, and other facilities were successively built, and all equipment was modeled after Europe and America. In the spring of 11th, the university department was first moved in, and the middle school department was still operated at the original site in Xujiahui. In 13th, President Li requested a leave of absence to travel south, and Guo Renyuan acted as the president, opening the College of Psychology and attaching the Experimental Middle School. In the spring of 14th, President Li returned to China, and the board of directors elected Guo Renyuan as the vice president. He resigned in the summer of 16th. From the 8th year of the Republic of China to the summer of the 19th year, a total of 1,189 students graduated from various departments of the university.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Large Quantities of Japanese Rice Shipped to Shanghai <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Mitsukeyama Maru Will Arrive in a Day or Two</p>
<p>The Azumayama Maru Will Continue to Transport Rice After a bumper autumn harvest in Japan this year, the Japanese government's stored rice has reached more than 2.2 million shi due to years of accumulation. After Japan's efforts to improve agriculture, not only is there no need for foreign rice, but the domestic production is suffering from excess. Recently, the rice market has plummeted by more than one yuan per dou. Also, due to the bumper autumn harvest, the Japanese government, considering that the stored rice is old and unsaleable in the country, is trying to sell it overseas. The price of rice in Shanghai is actually more expensive than Japanese rice, so the Japanese government has decided to ship a large quantity to Shanghai for trial sale. The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has now sent Mr. Katayama and Mr. Sawada to supervise this matter. They have leased two transport ships from Mitsui &amp; Co., one named the Mitsukeyama Maru and the other the Azumayama Maru. The Mitsukeyama Maru will load 5,000 tons of Japanese rice in Kobe on the 11th of this month and ship it to Shanghai, which is expected to arrive around the 15th or 16th of this month. After that, the Azumayama Maru will set sail with 7,000 tons, all of which will be sold in our country. It is heard that each shi will be sold for ten yuan to test the sales in our country. It is hoped that all sectors of our country will pay attention. The Japanese rice shipped to Shanghai is all old. If it can be sold well in Shanghai, then 2.2 million shi of old rice will be shipped to our country, with a total value of 22 million yuan.</p>

<p>Director Pan's Speech Today, the Third National Products Sports Meet of Shanghai City is holding a national products silk and satin exhibition at the City General Chamber of Commerce. I am very happy and honored to have you all come to visit. Since the opening of this National Products Sports Meet on the 7th, we have used various methods to promote the practicality of our country's self-made goods, and especially pay attention to clothing materials. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four major needs of life. Therefore, this conference has specially devoted itself to promoting the use of Chinese materials to make clothes. We know that the trade deficit of foreign goods coming to China reaches 400 million yuan per year, that is, each person contributes about one yuan to foreigners every year. At least half or one-third of this amount is used for clothing. It can be seen that the Chinese people are obsessed with foreign clothing materials. Of course, there is no Chinese material for wearing Western clothes, and even those who wear Chinese clothes do not know the benefits of Chinese silk and satin, and they all tend to use foreign goods. We held a national products fashion exhibition at the Dahua Hotel on October 9th. At that time, many famous ladies who participated in the performance wore various costumes made of national product materials. They felt that the quality, color, pattern, and style were all good, and they were noble and precious, and they were by no means inferior to foreign goods. This is witnessed by those who participated in the meeting. However, the conference was biased towards the female community, and due to ticket restrictions, it was unable to extend the invitation to guests, and it was deeply felt that the publicity was not sufficient. Therefore, we specially consulted with the National Products Silk and Satin Industry Association to hold a national products silk and satin exhibition before the closing of today's conference. Please come and visit. You must know that there are many products from various factories. Today's display is only a selection of several types, divided into grades, so that everyone can choose materials according to their living standards and needs, and can also compare them with foreign goods. Because Chinese people often have the psychology of worshiping foreign goods and despising Chinese goods, when they see clothing materials sold on the market, if they are exquisite, they think they are foreign goods. Merchants cater to this psychology and sell them as foreign goods. This erroneous concept can be swept away after visiting today's exhibits. I hope that you will buy national product clothing from now on. If you make silk clothes, you must buy Chinese silk and satin. If you still reject the good silk and satin that China already has and buy foreign silk and satin, such slave-like behavior, I believe you will never do. And I hope that you will not only set an example, but also persuade others to buy Chinese clothing materials together.</p>
<p>Wang Yansong Reports Wang Yansong, representative of the silk and satin industry, reported that today is the Third National Products Sports Meet of the Shanghai Social Bureau, holding a national products silk and satin exhibition, because the conference feels that promoting national products is not limited to silk and satin, but China is based on silk and tea, and large-scale exports. In recent years, the silk and satin industry has declined and is in urgent need of relief. Therefore, we have designated a day for large-scale publicity. In the future, the benefits of revitalization will not only be limited to the silk and satin industry, but all industrial and commercial people who raise silkworms, reel silk, and weave satin will depend on it for survival, which is really related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Our industry should be very grateful for the enthusiastic promotion of the Social Bureau. However, the promotion of national products cannot be achieved by empty words. Everyone must enthusiastically purchase and love national products, which is patriotism. For example, in a family, parents love their children, and no one abandons their own children and turns to love other people's children. Therefore, loving compatriots is to cherish domestic products. In the future, our industry will work hard to improve the quality of our products to compete with foreign goods, but you must promote and be happy to purchase them in order to achieve practical results, so as not to fail the enthusiasm of the Social Bureau's promotion.</p>
<p>Fan Zhengbo's Speech Fan Zhengbo, representative of the Municipal Party Department, said that Mr. Wang Yansong has already said very frankly the reason why national products should be used for making clothes. This is still limited to purchasing national products. What I want to report to you is the responsibility of merchants in selling national products. We know that in poor rural areas with inconvenient transportation, the clothes and food are all national products. Once you get to the city, foreign goods are everywhere. For example, in the prosperous areas of this city, if you go to various shops, most of them sell foreign goods. Even if you want national products, there is no way to get them. What's more, the patriotism and discernment of ordinary people are not sufficient at all. Therefore, I hope that merchants will take the responsibility of promoting national products, and after selling all the foreign goods in their shops, they will no longer purchase them. If every family does this, even if someone wants to use foreign goods, there will be no place to buy them. Otherwise, if the sellers sell and the buyers buy, then it will be useless to hold this meeting dozens of times.</p>
<p>Other Speeches Finally, Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the City General Chamber of Commerce, gave a speech, exhorting the guests to resolve to purchase national products and develop industries from now on. If they continue to be perfunctory, the country will not be a country. His words were extremely sincere. Mr. Ye Huijun also gave a speech, exhorting everyone to be of one heart and one mind, to arouse their conscience, to supervise each other, and to reject foreign goods and buy national products from now on. He also used the example of Japanese people not using Chinese goods as a comparison. His words were extremely painful, and the audience was moved.</p>
<p>Sale of Tickets and Gifts Everyone received many daily necessities donated by national product manufacturers, such as towels, butterfly cream, soap, toothbrushes, scented soap, lace, wine, cigarettes, woven pillows, silk, and clothing materials. Special tickets were sold to draw lots and distribute gifts to the guests. Each ticket was half a yuan, and each person was limited to one ticket. A total of 430 tickets were sold. At least two pieces of silk oil worth one yuan can be obtained, and at most silk clothing materials worth 50 to 60 yuan can be obtained. Those who bought tickets were very crowded. All the funds from the sale of tickets were allocated to the Women's Promotion of Goods Association for expenses.</p>

<p>A Public Notice from the Exhibition Everyone knows that silk and satin are special products of China, with excellent quality, firmness, and durability. Not only are they recognized by the Chinese people as superior clothing materials, but they are also popular all over the world and are a major export of our country. Since Japan, Vietnam, and other countries have imposed harsh taxes on Chinese silk, the foreign trade of Chinese silk has been almost completely blocked. And the ignorant compatriots in the country are plagiarizing the fur of Europeans, wearing Western leather shoes, and desperately acting as salesmen for imperialists. Generally, people are full of foreign goods, wool and flannel, especially in the women's community. There is a feeling that it is not fashionable to wear foreign goods. As this trend grows, the whole country, from top to bottom, is full of foreign air. Therefore, giant ships loaded with foreign goods are about to squeeze through the Wusongkou. The sales of domestic silk and satin have been almost completely plundered. Silk factories have closed down, and farmers and workers have lost their jobs, creating a terrible social situation. The outflow of profits is increasing year by year. The cream and blood of the Chinese Republic flag is almost exhausted. The ambition of imperialist economic aggression is getting higher and higher day by day. This dangerous situation is all caused by the Chinese people's love of using foreign goods and abandoning Chinese silk. Now we can wake up, because since the National Government promulgated the clothing regulations, we know that the national dress is a blue robe and a black mandarin jacket, and the material is limited to domestic silk. Recently, Wang Wu, a diplomatic leader, wore a robe and mandarin jacket to attend international banquets, and all countries praised it very much, which shows that our country's clothing is graceful and worthy of praise all over the world. People who love to wear Western clothes, if they don't know the true beauty and goodness, they must be inferior by nature and act as foreign slaves. Foreign wool and flannel are most likely to hide dirt, and if they are not stored carefully, they will be eaten by frogs and insects, resulting in large holes. Moreover, at this time when gold is expensive and silver is cheap, the value is even more noble. It is far inferior to the cheap and good quality of domestic silk and satin, which are durable and can be washed, dyed, and remade when they are old. Therefore, when it comes to personal economy, we must reject foreign goods and use domestic silk and satin. Women's love of beauty is even greater than that of men. But those who have been to the Dahua Hotel National Products Fashion Exhibition have seen the famous ladies wearing new national silk costumes on that day, how graceful and luxurious, and wealthy. Can foreign clothing materials match it? In order to obtain true beauty and goodness and true economy, we should use domestic silk and satin. In order to resist economic aggression and solve the difficult problems of the national economy and the people's livelihood, we should reject foreign wool and flannel silk and satin, and all imported goods. Compatriots, quickly unite and overthrow foreign wool and flannel, overthrow imported silk fabrics, overthrow imperialist economic aggression, and use domestic silk and satin.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Wage Increase Movement for Chinese Seamen on Foreign Ships Nearing Resolution <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yu and Chen to Mediate</p>
<p>Seamen Show Flexibility. The case of seamen demanding wage increases from six foreign shipping companies has been repeatedly negotiated by the Seamen's Union with Swire Shipping and other companies without success, as previously reported in this newspaper. It has been learned that Yu Qiaqing and Chen Bogang are mediating in this matter, and both sides are gradually approaching an agreement. Yesterday, this reporter contacted Mr. Wang Yongsheng, the guiding committee member of the union, to learn about the progress of the negotiations and the mediation efforts. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiation Process. The Seamen's Union sent representatives to negotiate wage increases with Swire, Jardine, and other companies. Swire repeatedly stated that it did not oppose the principle of wage increases but requested a postponement due to poor business this year. As a result, no agreement was reached. On Tuesday of last week, seamen's representatives negotiated this matter with Swire. Swire only agreed to transfer the rice allowance to the wage increase, which was opposed by the seamen. By Double Ten Day, Swire Company, in order to resolve the wage increase case as soon as possible, voluntarily invited Yu Qiaqing and Chen Bogang, the chairman of the Shipping Association, to mediate.</p>
<p>Yu and Chen's Mediation. Entrusted by the British companies, Yu and Chen mediated between labor and management. At 6 PM on the 10th, they went to the Seamen's Union on Qiu Jiang Road to discuss mediation methods with labor representatives. Yu and Chen explained to the representatives that the wages of Swire ships' seamen were slightly higher than other companies and requested some concessions, while Chinese ships would definitely not follow suit. They also hoped for a response that day to facilitate mediation. Yu and Chen then left to await the seamen's reply.</p>
<p>New Plan Resolved. The Seamen's Union convened an emergency meeting of all members on the 11th to discuss how to respond to Yu and Chen's mediation. All members voted to (1) increase the monthly salary of Swire ships, which was already 28.8 yuan, by six yuan after canceling the rice allowance (currently increasing by four yuan, with another two yuan in March of next year).</p>
<p>Now, they are willing to concede one yuan and change it to a one-time increase of five yuan. After the decision was made, a formal letter was immediately sent to Mr. Yu, requesting him to convey it. Since Mr. Yu has gone to Beijing, the matter must wait until his return to Shanghai to be resolved.</p>
<p>Jardine Handles Separately. Regarding the wage increase case for Jardine Matheson's ships, the seamen decided to deal with it separately because the company had hired non-union members and undermined the labor movement during the May 30th Massacre and had also reduced seamen's wages by two yuan (currently only 26.8 yuan). The resolved plan is: (1) The rice allowance should be canceled and six yuan should be added. (2) The two yuan monthly salary deducted during the May 30th incident must be compensated and recalculated to the present. Furthermore, regarding the Nissin Company's ships, because they have not been sincere in their dealings regarding the wage increase issue, it is necessary to negotiate seriously. Therefore, it is necessary to add a full six yuan and absolutely no concessions can be made. This demand has also been put forward.</p>
<p>Hope for Resolution. Yu Qiaqing can forward the seamen's new demands to Swire upon his return to Shanghai from Beijing. According to Wang Yongsheng, the opinions of both sides are close to an agreement regarding the wage increase case for Swire ships. With Yu and Chen mediating, a satisfactory resolution can be expected soon.</p>
<p>Wage Increase for Stewards. The stewards of various ships are also included in this wage increase request. However, for the monthly salaries of stewards, most shipping companies delegate the responsibility to the compradors, which is different from the direct payment of salaries to stokers and sailors. Now that a wage increase has been proposed, the Chinese shipping companies have agreed to increase the salary portion of each ship's steward by 20% starting in August and then by another 10% in March of next year. This matter has been decided by the companies and has already been notified to the ship compradors for implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Active Improvement Plan for the Beijing-Shanghai Railway <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>New-Style Locomotives Ordered for Passenger Trains</p>
<p>Regulations Issued for Compliance. The Traffic Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, in view of the increased passenger and freight traffic compared to the past, has increased the number of trains this year to strive for passenger convenience. However, the current locomotives used by the railway are old, and their horsepower is somewhat insufficient, resulting in slightly weaker towing power. Therefore, delays occur immediately when affected by adverse weather conditions. In view of this, the railway ordered six new-style locomotives from the Pacific Company last month. Their towing power is half that of the older ones and are intended for use on passenger trains. The railway is also cooperating with the Railway Affairs Department to actively improve all train operations to ensure that all trains scheduled to depart daily arrive at their stations on time. All stations along the route have also been issued train operation regulations and ordered to comply to avoid unnecessary delays. Stations with incomplete facilities will be immediately set up to ensure that there will be no difficulties in train operations in the future. All of the above plans are being implemented separately. Other improvements will also continue to be implemented in sequence according to the original plan.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Wuhan Opens Wireless Telegraph <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Receiving and Sending Begins Immediately. Wuhan is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The Ministry of Communications originally set up a long-wave radio station there to communicate with ships sailing up and down the Yangtze River. However, because it was not connected with short-wave stations in various parts of the country, it could not communicate with each other. Radio stations in various places, except for telegrams to Wuhan requested by the sender to be forwarded by post from Hankou, did not accept them. Now, the Radio Management Bureau, in response to requests from merchants and residents in various places, has submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to open wireless telegraph service in Wuhan, add equipment to the Wuhan Radio Station, and has notified radio stations nationwide to start receiving and sending commercial telegrams there immediately. From now on, telegrams to Wuhan can be transmitted by radio, which will also be welcomed by merchants in the upper Yangtze River area.</p>
<h3 id="e128">County Public Security Funds Not Available <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County received an instruction from the Department of Civil Affairs yesterday, stating: "Regarding compliance matters, we have approved a consultation from the Department of Finance stating that, according to a submission from Shanghai County stating that public security salaries are in arrears and there are no funds available, we request a loan to provide relief. This is to be reviewed and responded to for compliance, etc. We have approved this. The Shanghai County Public Security Bureau's police salaries have been in arrears because the Municipal Government has withheld the subsidies that should be provided, and this office has already borrowed 4,000 yuan twice from the provincial funds to maintain the status quo. This loan is intended as a temporary relief measure and cannot be relied upon as a regular occurrence. Moreover, the current provincial treasury is facing even greater difficulties than local governments, and the budget for the 19th year has already been determined, making it impossible to allocate funds. The county's public security funds should be immediately instructed to urge the Finance Bureau to follow the office's order and quickly calculate the accounts with the Municipal Finance Bureau to find a fundamental solution, and temporarily use local funds or find other ways to supplement the funds before a solution is found. In response to the previous consultation, we hereby consult back for your information and compliance, etc. We have approved this. We have already sent separate consultations regarding the previous report from the County Magistrate. In response to the previous consultation, we hereby instruct the County Magistrate to comply with and handle the matter immediately. This instruction."</p>
<h3 id="e129">Pan Peide's Opinion on Borrowing and Levying Rent <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Requests Publication of Borrowing and Levying Amounts</p>
<p>And Set Limit at One Million Yuan. Pan Peide, a Shanghai Chinese property owner, submitted a document to the Municipal Government, stating: "Regarding the case of borrowing and levying rent to raise customs treasury bonds, in accordance with the announcement, the main priority is to ensure timely and full amounts. I humbly request that you instruct the micro-collection agencies to announce the amounts at any time, and once the coupon is fully subscribed, immediately stop the micro-levy to show great faith and alleviate the people's hardship. I have investigated that the Central Government issued short-term customs treasury bonds for the 19th year, and this city was ordered to raise one million yuan. After deliberation by your bureau, it was announced that rent would be borrowed and levied for two months, and twelve articles of regulations were stipulated and announced for implementation. Previously, due to military affairs and wars, the Chinese properties in this city had already sacrificed rent and fulfilled their obligations repeatedly. Now, the market is sluggish, property prices have plummeted, and rent arrears are consistently more than half a year. The monthly rental income for those who invest in property is often insufficient to cover the interest on mortgages, and for the elderly, widowed, and weak who rely on rental income for their livelihood, it is not enough to support their families. There are real examples to prove this kind of hardship, and it is deeply heartbreaking to talk about. However, considering that this customs treasury bond is related to the country's military needs, although it is beyond our capabilities, we should reluctantly bear the burden to fulfill our obligations as citizens. However, public opinion believes that since the customs treasury bond is fixed at one million yuan, the rent should also be limited to one million yuan. The regulations stipulate that rent will be borrowed and levied for two months, which is excessive and will inevitably increase the burden. Therefore, property owners do not avoid expressing their opinions to you. I have investigated that in the Republic of China's 16th year, this city levied patriotic donations for two months, also using rent to offset the cost, collecting approximately 1.25 million yuan per month, totaling 2.5 million yuan for two months. Old donation records are available for verification. Based on this, levying rent for one month to offset one million yuan of treasury bonds is sufficient. Furthermore, it is heard that the collection area includes not only the concessions but also all properties in the towns and cities within this city's jurisdiction and the roads built across borders. In addition, rental income has slightly increased in recent years, so levying rent for one month is estimated to be more than one million yuan. Furthermore, I have investigated that this city collects property donations every month, with housing at 10% of the rent and stores at 40% of the rent. The Finance Bureau must have statistics on property donation income and can find out how much monthly rental income is, so it is impossible to be without any certainty. If the numbers are close to the above figures, then levying rent for one month is enough to offset one million yuan of treasury bonds, which is even more credible. For the sake of raising customs treasury bonds, borrowing and levying rent for two months will inevitably result in more than double the quota, and property owners have no extra capacity to bear such a heavy burden. At this time, we only seek to ensure the quota of one million yuan for customs treasury bonds. If levying rent for one month is already sufficient, then the second month can be stopped. Taking a step back, if levying rent for one month is still 200,000 yuan short of the quota, then levying rent for one week in the second month will be sufficient. In short, the amount and time should be calculated proportionally to raise the full quota, and then the micro-levy should be stopped. Therefore, the stipulated two-month period should be considered as a hypothetical period with some room for adjustment. Therefore, we jointly appeal and request that you examine and verify this matter and order the collection agencies to announce the amount of rent collected at any time, and once the quota for customs treasury bonds is raised, immediately stop the micro-levy. In this way, we can maintain faith from top to bottom, which would be beneficial to the overall situation and the property owners. Respectfully submitted."</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Hankou Preparatory Headquarters yesterday, stating: "Urgent. To the esteemed Commander of the Hankou Preparatory Headquarters: We have recently received a statement from the headquarters of Guangyi Bookstore stating that its Yichang branch was sealed by the Yichang Preparatory Headquarters on the 8th, and the manager, Tu Ruiqing, was summoned. It was discovered that 34 packages of books were sent by Shanghai Huatong Bookstore, and the Yichang branch sent the original documents back to Shanghai. The headquarters in Hankou ordered the seizure and sealing of the branch. Please provide a telegram to prove that this matter has nothing to do with the Yichang branch. If there is any falsehood, we are willing to accept severe punishment. Our Chamber has verified that this bookstore has been established in Shanghai for more than 30 years and has always been law-abiding. The Yichang branch has never had any dealings with Huatong Bookstore, and it immediately refused to accept the books and returned them to Shanghai. There is an original letter from the branch refusing to sell on consignment, which was sent to the Chamber for verification, and the original packages seized this time can prove that it was a misunderstanding. We respectfully request that you investigate the facts and issue a telegram to the Yichang Garrison Commander to lift the seal and release the staff to maintain commerce. We are eagerly awaiting your reply. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully bows."</p>

<p>The Child Research Department of the Chinese Child Welfare Association, in addition to having a committee of experts dedicated to research and publishing a series of books, has repeatedly invited foreign child welfare experts to China to lecture to promote discussion and planning.

<p>Chen Jinjiang Angrily Jumps into the Sea</p>
<p>Floats in Water for Five Hours</p>
<p>Catches a Big Fish to Appease Hunger</p>
<p>Rescued by the Huan Ya Steamer. Yesterday, the Huan Ya steamer arrived in port, bringing a novel news story of a Chinese man jumping into the sea in the Red Sea. The story is quite interesting and is described as follows: A man named Chen Jinjiang, from Dinghai, Ningbo, 24 years old, worked as a stoker on the Blue Funnel Line's mail ship Deucalion. The ship sailed from Shanghai to Liverpool, England, on August 18th. In mid-September, while sailing through the Red Sea, Chen Jinjiang asked Wang Fa, the head stoker, for two days of leave due to illness. Wang Fa not only refused to grant him leave but also beat Chen Jinjiang with a rattan stick, forcing him to work while ill. Chen Jinjiang had no choice at the time and, in despair, jumped into the Red Sea to end his life on the morning of September 16th at 10 AM. Surprisingly, he did not drown for five hours and even caught a two-pound fish to appease his hunger. At 4 PM that afternoon, the Huan Ya steamer happened to pass through the Red Sea, and the crew saw Chen Jinjiang floating on the sea surface and quickly rescued him, taking him to Bombay and then to Shanghai yesterday. According to Chen Jinjiang, he plans to return to Ningbo in the coming days and says that he is not good at swimming. As for why he did not drown in the sea for five hours, he does not know either.</p>

<p>Hsing Ting-ch'eng, the Chinese manager of the New Sassoon Company, owner of Qingyun Lane in Hongkou, Shanghai, forcibly ordered tenants to move out unsuccessfully. At 10 AM on September 10th, he used violent and unreasonable means to hire more than 300 Russian hooligans to demolish the roofs and injure people. The tenants' association of Qingyun Lane, considering that the owner was relying on force to bully the weak, which is unpardonable by law, in addition to appealing to various levels of agencies in this city and the highest agencies in Nanjing, specially hired lawyers Wang Zuxun and Xue Jiaqi to file a public lawsuit according to law, accusing Chinese manager Hsing Ting-ch'eng in the Shanghai Special District Court. After receiving the complaint, the court decided to hear the case in the second criminal court of the court at 2 PM on October 14th (today).</p>

<p>Attended by a Sea of People</p>
<p>Variety Show Was Excellent in Every Way. The masquerade ball and variety show held by Dr. Zheng Yuxiu to benefit the victims of the Liaoxi flood started at 9 PM on the evening before last (the 12th) at the Dahua Hotel on Gordon Road. Before 8 PM, the area around Jing'an Temple Road was already filled with cars, and the guests were like a surging tide. By 9 PM, there was no room to stand in the venue. The military band of the Municipal Public Security Bureau played national music to open the event amid applause from the crowd. Then, various programs continued to be performed. Famous ladies in costume danced, some dressed in palace attire, others in theatrical costumes, and they danced gracefully to melodious music, which was quite interesting. The male and female guests in the audience also joined in, and their enthusiasm was very high. Then, students from the Liangjiang Women's Sports School performed dances, which were extremely wonderful. The Datong Music Society, led by Mr. Zheng Qinwen, led the entire group of members to play five pieces of ancient music, and Chinese and foreign guests alike praised them unanimously. This was followed by male and female movie stars jointly performing The Great Grape Fairy, with excellent singing and dancing. After the performance, the association presented Ms. Hu Die with a silver cup and the Mingxing Company with a silver shield to express their gratitude. However, Ms. Hu and the company were willing to auction off the silver shield and silver cup on the spot to help the disaster victims. Mr. Hong Shen raised his glass and called out, and as a result, the silver cup was won by Mr. Zhang Xiaolin for 200 yuan, and the silver shield was won by Mr. Du Yuesheng for 300 yuan. However, after paying, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Du returned the silver cup and silver shield to Ms. Hu and the Mingxing Company to keep as souvenirs. At 1 AM yesterday morning, famous actor Cheng Yanqiu arrived and performed the sword dance from the Red Whisk Girl, which drew thunderous applause. Mr. Cheng also sang a section of "Willow Greets Spring" from Fenhe Bay at the request of the audience, and almost every word was perfect. Mr. Cheng was enthusiastic about helping the disaster relief efforts, and all of his staff did not take any fees, which was especially commendable. It was not until 2:30 AM yesterday morning that the various performances ended, and the audience gradually dispersed, and it was already after 3 AM. It can be said that it was a grand occasion for a time. Also, Dr. Zheng worked extremely hard to organize this event and has suffered a minor illness. She entrusted various parties to sell a large number of tickets, and the ticket money continued to be sent yesterday. Once all the money is collected, it will be remitted to Liaoning to help the disaster victims.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Died While Watching Airplanes <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Only Cared About Looking Up at the Sky</p>
<p>Did Not Prevent Cars Underground. On Double Ten National Day, airplanes flew in the sky over this city to celebrate. At 11:15 AM on the morning of that day, a countryman named Zhang Ahe, about 42 or 43 years old, was walking on Edward Road, at the intersection of the British and French concessions, when he heard the sound of airplanes in the sky. He looked up while walking in the middle of the road. At that moment, a car No. 161, owned and driven by a British man Huier Sen, residing at No. 78 Albert Road, was driving from the French Concession from east to west. The countryman only cared about looking up at the airplanes in the sky and did not pay attention to the vehicles on the road. The British man's car could not avoid him in time and knocked him down, injuring the back of his head. The British concession police saw this, took down the license plate number, and sent the injured person and car to Renji Hospital for treatment, and reported to the French police for verification. After Zhang was admitted to the hospital, the doctor asked his name and surname, but he could not answer due to coughing. He died at 6:15 PM the following afternoon due to serious injuries and ineffective treatment. The hospital notified the police, who took the body to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for an autopsy. There were no relatives to be found. Yesterday, the Car Affairs Office of the French police summoned the defendant to the station and reported to Judge Zhu Cheng of the French Concession Court, who confirmed that the deceased had been injured by a car and died. He ordered that photos be taken and that the court provide a coffin for burial and placement in the ancestral hall. The defendant was released on bail, and if no relatives come forward within six months, the case will be dismissed. The deceased had a monk's hairstyle, wore a new white twill short shirt and trousers, a new blue cloth shirt, coffee-colored thread socks, and a straight-woven white leather-soled shoe, resembling a rural farmer.</p>

<p>Six Robbers Arrested in Succession</p>
<p>A Lot of Military Arms Seized. Detective Xie Shuiquan of the General Police Department learned that a kidnapping gang was organizing a kidnapping plot inside No. 29 Shaoqing Lane on Lafayette Road in the French Concession, holding secret meetings and plotting illegal activities. On the morning of the 11th at 9 AM, he, together with detectives Ma Xiaozhi, Bao Wen, Ding Huaguo, West Detective Mayson, and others, went to the house upstairs with Chinese and Western detectives from the French Police Department and arrested Yang Hua, a resident of Pudong, Monk Hua Quanrui, and Shen Laiyi, four robbers. They seized a pistol, eight live rounds, and eight Mauser bullets in a drawer. They also seized a Mauser pistol and 23 bullets under a wardrobe and brought them to the police station. Later, Yang confessed that his accomplices, Hu Shaoqing from Suzhou and Wang A'er from Shanghai, were at a certain teahouse on Haikou Road. The detectives went again and arrested Hu and Wang. They also seized 200 yuan in cash, 100 yuan in counterfeit money, and gold jewelry and other valuables at Wang's home at No. 871 Dongsheng Lane on Zhejiang Road. They were taken to the police station and sent to the first criminal court of the Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi explained the arrest situation and said that the police had not yet investigated the defendants' crimes, so they were temporarily prosecuting them under Article 161 of the Criminal Law for organizing a criminal gang with the purpose of committing crimes, and also charged the four defendants, Yang, Qin, Hua, and Shen, with violating Article 1 of the Regulations for the Suppression of Military Firearms and requested a 14-day extension for investigation. Yang and Hua confessed that they had previously organized the kidnapping of Jiang from Chunzai Lane on Xinzha Road. The other people gave evasive testimony. Wang A'er even hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Yuan Yangan to defend him. After reviewing the confessions, Judge Sun Yuan ordered all defendants to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e139">City National Arts Hall Opens Welcoming New Members Conference <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Simultaneously Distributing Solicited Prizes</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zhijiang Attends and Delivers a Speech: The Shanghai City National Arts Hall held a conference yesterday in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce assembly hall to welcome new members and distribute solicited prizes. Over two thousand male and female members attended. Mr. Zhang Zhijiang, Director of the Central National Arts Hall, was invited to give a speech. Mr. Zhang Yuejun, Director of the hall (represented by Secretary Cen of the Municipal Government), presided over the meeting. The meeting began at 2:30 p.m. with the ringing of a bell. The chairman delivered a welcome address, stating that the hall was holding a conference to welcome new members and distribute solicited prizes. Seeing such a large number of attendees indicates the excellent results of this solicitation and demonstrates that society is gradually beginning to believe in the value of national arts. This is very gratifying. We know that the efficacy of national arts can strengthen the body and the race, defend the country and protect the people. We hope that the members and guests present today will not only study and practice themselves, but also work hard to promote national arts so that they become widespread throughout the city. Mr. Zhang Zhijiang then gave a speech, stating that he was very pleased to participate in today's grand welcoming event. The Shanghai City National Arts Hall was established shortly after the Central National Arts Hall. There are now nine training grounds and nearly two thousand members, and significant achievements have already been made. I greatly admire and am very happy about this. National arts are the only way to strengthen physical fitness and are of great importance to the country. I attended the Far Eastern Games held in Japan and the results were the worst for our country. In some events, we did not even have a single participant. The weakness of the physical constitution of our citizens and the lack of attention to physical education were evident. This highlights the importance of practicing national arts. We know that to achieve construction, it must start from a spiritual foundation. Without a healthy body and an enthusiastic spirit, nothing can be accomplished. Therefore, national arts are the foundation of the Party and the country. Currently, bandits are rampant in provinces such as Henan, committing murder, kidnapping, and all sorts of evils. The people, lacking the ability to resist, are forced to submit and suffer their ravages. In this kind of situation, unless military police are stationed everywhere to protect them, which is not practically possible, our Premier said that individuals, groups, and countries must have the ability to defend themselves in order to survive. Conversely, without the ability to defend oneself, one cannot survive. We must have the ability to defend ourselves, and the only way to do this is for everyone to practice national arts. When I went to Japan, I saw that the country placed great emphasis on physical education, regardless of whether they were farmers, workers, or merchants. Our national arts are unique in the world. This is our national essence, our treasure. We must promote and develop this national essence and treasure. The meaning of today's conference is not only to welcome you all, but also to hope that you will go back and encourage your brothers, children, sisters, relatives, and friends to practice national arts. Mr. Chen Jiaxuan, a director, then reported on the solicitation process, stating that the hall has been established for almost three years. The second solicitation increased by 20% compared to the first, and the third solicitation increased by 30% compared to the second. This is a very good sign. However, considering the population of Shanghai, it is still less than one-thousandth of the population. Therefore, we must continue to work hard to make national arts more and more popular every day. After the report, the chairman distributed the solicited prizes. The first prize for each team went to the Unity Team, the second to the Freedom Team, and the third to the People's Rights Team. The individuals with the best performance were Zhu Jiangguang, Tong Zhongyi, and Du Yuesheng. Those with excellent performance were Ye Qichang. Following this, the hall's instructors and students from various training grounds performed national arts. The Magic Spirit Illusion Society's Liang Tian magic troupe performed magic, and the Art and Music Dance Society's sister dance troupe and the New China Music and Dance Society performed dances, all of which were exceptionally wonderful and met with thunderous applause. The meeting adjourned around 7:00 p.m.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Department Executive Committee recently noted that pharmacies in this city still offer discounts of 10% or 20% on the days of the new and full moon according to the abolished lunar calendar, which is contrary to the principle of promoting the Gregorian calendar. Therefore, it specifically submitted a request to the Central Party Department to forward it to the National Government, requesting instructions to the Executive Yuan to order the Shanghai Municipal Government to order all pharmacies in the city to no longer use the abolished lunar calendar for discounts in the future, but to uniformly use the Gregorian calendar for the new and full moon each month, so that the people's psychology of adhering to the Gregorian calendar can be positively influenced. Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Government received instructions from the Executive Yuan and has transferred the order to the Social Affairs Bureau to forward it to the Pharmaceutical Industry Association for distribution to all colleagues to comply with.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Repair of the Yantai-Dalian Submarine Cable <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Unimpeded Communication between Shanghai and Dalian: Dalian is an important town in the Northeast, and its commercial prosperity is the crown of Northeast China. Therefore, telegraphic communication is very important. Telegrams sent from this city to Dalian have always been transmitted by the China Telegraph Administration. Because the Administration's line between Yantai and Shanghai is a new submarine duplex line, and the Yantai-Dalian line is also a duplex line, telegrams sent to Dalian only take about ten minutes. Third-class urgent telegrams can arrive in a few minutes. The Administration receives and sends over a thousand telegrams to Dalian every day. However, since the Yantai-Dalian submarine cable broke on the 27th of last month, telegrams to Dalian have been rerouted through Tianjin, Liaoning, and other bureaus. The roundabout transmission has inevitably been delayed, which has inconvenienced merchants and residents. According to news from the China Telegraph General Administration yesterday, the submarine cable between Yantai and Dalian was repaired yesterday (the 13th) morning. Telegrams to Dalian can now be delivered within ten minutes as usual. Anyone wishing to send telegrams can directly contact the China Telegraph General Administration on Sichuan Road in this city, the Shanghai Telegraph North Bureau behind the Jiande Savings Society on Fusheng Road in Zhabei, the Shanghai Telegraph South Bureau at Xiaodongmen in Nanshi, the China Telegraph General Administration sub-receiving office inside the Shanghai Bank at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road, or the China Telegraph General Administration sub-receiving and sending office inside the Shanghai Bank in Tilanqiao.</p>

<p>Former Lovers Now Bitter Enemies - Twice Gathering Crowds to Splash Caustic Soda</p>
<p>Ah Zhen, the eldest daughter of the Shen Zhu family, a Shaoxing woman residing at No. 2018 Xinzha Road, is 29 years old and beautiful. In the spring of this year, she formed an inseparable bond with Zhu Zhongrong, and they rented a house to live together. Zhu provided Shen Zhu with forty yuan per month. Later, Zhu's business closed down, and he became financially strained, unable to afford the monthly payment of forty yuan. Ah Zhen was taken back by her mother, who forbade her from associating with Zhu. Zhu harbored resentment and sought to harm them. On June 6th of this year, at around 7:00 a.m., he gathered a crowd of people and suddenly went to their house, splashing nitric acid indiscriminately, causing injuries to the mother and Ah Zhen. Zhu then fled. However, his heart was still not satisfied. On the 5th of this month, at around 2:00 p.m., Zhu gathered over twenty hooligans and stormed into the Shen Zhu family's house. One person hit the mother's body with an iron bar, and another held Ah Zhen's head, while Zhu poured caustic soda on her, causing severe injuries to Ah Zhen. The mother's face was also affected. Zhu and the others then fled in the chaos. Someone reported this to the Xinzha Police Station, who sent the mother and Ah Zhen to the hospital for treatment. The police then ordered Chinese and Western detectives to arrest the suspects Xu Liansheng, Wang Weixiang, Zhang Huangguang, Li Zigang, Chen Ruilin, and Yang Liubao in room 43 of the Pacific Hotel on Guangxi Road on the day before yesterday afternoon. The main criminal, Zhu Zhongrong, was still at large. They were all taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the case, claiming that Shen Ah Zhen had been severely injured and was still in the hospital for treatment, requesting an extension. The plaintiff, Shen Zhu, also filed a complaint, explaining the previous situation and identifying the defendants Xu Liansheng and Wang Weixiang as having come with Zhu both times. This time, Xu hit me with an iron bar, Wang held my daughter's head, and Zhu poured caustic soda. Shen Baozhen, Shen Zhu's adopted daughter, testified that she was fourteen years old and sick at home on the 5th of this month, and witnessed Xu, Wang, and the fifth defendant Chen Ruilin being present. When questioned, the defendants all denied the charges. Only Wang Weixiang confessed that Zhu Zhongrong was his friend, and that Zhu and three others went together that day. The caustic soda was poured by someone else, and his arm was also burned. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confessions and ordered the six defendants to be detained for further questioning in seven days.</p>

His younger brother and others heard the news and rushed forward to help him, carrying him onto a car and sending him to Baolong Hospital for treatment.

<p>Recently, the market prices of copper coins in various ports have differed. For example, in Jiangbei, one silver dollar can be exchanged for many copper coins.

Therefore, it has been ordered that strict prohibition be enforced. However, there are still many people who smuggle them at risk.

<p>Market Closed for One Day</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Wenbin, a native of Shaoxing, who initiated the establishment of the Flour Exchange and served as its Vice Chairman for many years, passed away. In the eighth year of the Republic [1919], he founded the exchange. At that time, China had no such enterprise. The Flour Exchange's establishment and flourishing business led to a wave of imitations, creating a significant trend. The fact that only the Flour Exchange survived is attributed to Mr. Xu's efforts. Mr. Xu also held key positions in Shen Da Flour Company and various banks, causing him great anxiety and exhaustion. Last autumn, he lost his eyesight. He stayed home for treatment, but it was to little avail. Last Saturday, he suddenly suffered a stroke, leading to his death yesterday morning at the age of fifty-two. The Flour Exchange, in recognition of his great contributions, has decided to close the market for one day today as a tribute to his memory.</p>

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3 id="e175">A Thank You to the Gentlemen Who Sponsored the National Goods Movement (Third Continuation) Pan Gongzhan <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>It is even clearer that the trend in the industrial and commercial sectors has reached a critical point. Of the cases in the 17th year [1928], those arising from wage issues numbered 27, three more than those related to layoffs. Cases related to working hours numbered 8. In the 18th year [1929], wage cases still numbered 26, but disputes over employment or layoffs had increased to 36, while working hours cases had decreased to only one. This shows that after the labor struggles in the 16th and 17th years, the increase in wages and the reduction in working hours had reached a considerable level. Beyond this limit, the capitalists were truly unable to cope and had no choice but to reduce the scope of their operations or simply close down. As a result, cases of disputes and strikes arising from layoffs naturally increased. In the 17th year, the percentage of cases where labor's demands were fully accepted as a result of strikes and shutdowns reached 38.47%, but this decreased to 28.83% in the 18th year. On the other hand, the percentage of cases where labor's demands were not recognized was only 10.25% in the 17th year, but this increased to 28.83% in the 18th year. This is certainly due to the gradual improvement in the capitalists' negotiating abilities, but the capitalists' business situation was truly on the verge of collapse, and the situation had reached a point where it could not be further aggravated. Therefore, there was this phenomenon. In other words, the industrial and commercial sectors of Shanghai, after the wave of labor unrest in the 16th and 17th years, had almost reached a dead end in the 18th year, with no room for maneuver. The capitalists had no choice but to do their best to contend with labor in the last moments of breath in order to survive, or simply resign themselves to fate and allow their businesses to shut down. Since the 14th year of the Republic [1925], national goods factories had been gradually gaining momentum for two or three years, but this setback was an undeniable disaster. Fifth, the pain felt by the industrial and commercial sectors is naturally due to the heavy and complex taxes. For example, the cocoon tax in the 2nd year of the Republic [1913] was only six yuan per load of dried cocoons, but recently it has increased to 13.5 yuan per load in Zhejiang, 12.5 yuan per load in Jiangsu, and 10.5 yuan per load in Anhui, an increase of about 100%. Another example is tea. Taking Huizhou tea as an example, the freight cost for transporting raw tea to Shanghai is 3.4 yuan per load, in addition to the manufacturing cost of 21.5 yuan, and the tax is 6.81 yuan. For boxed tea, the manufacturing cost is 10.84 yuan per load, and the freight is 2.8 yuan, with a tax of 2.36 yuan. The heavy production costs can be imagined. Another example is cigarettes. Chinese merchants feel the pain of the cigarette tax scale very deeply. According to the scale, there are seven grades. The sixth grade, with a selling price of over 128.81 yuan per case, has a tax of 53.625 yuan. The seventh grade, with a selling price of under 128.81 yuan per case, has a tax of 29.250 yuan. Most of the products produced by Chinese merchants only pay taxes at the sixth and seventh grades, with lower selling prices, and very few pay taxes at the fourth and fifth grades. The most painful thing is that the cost of raw materials has increased and expenses have increased, making the cost already high. But if the selling price is slightly increased by several yuan per case, the tax must change from the seventh grade to the sixth grade, requiring an additional tax of more than 20 yuan. If the market price is increased, sales will inevitably decrease significantly. Another example is silk fabrics. When exporting overseas, foreign governments levy heavy taxes. Without even considering that, in the country alone, the Guancheng Hall in Hangzhou donated 120,000 yuan annually before the 16th year of the Republic [1927], for a total of 160,000 yuan including water conservancy donations. Now it has increased to 480,000 yuan annually, a threefold increase. There is no need to continue the recitation. Another example is cotton textiles. In the 15th year of the Republic [1926], the import tax on yarn was 5%, and the import tax on cloth was 5.75%. In the 18th year [1929], it was uniformly 7.5%. The average estimated price of taxable goods also increased by 20% to 30%, which is equivalent to a tax increase. In addition, there is the likin tax. Each load of yarn had to pay 56 cents in the 15th year [1926] and 74 cents in the 18th year [1929], which also increased costs. Another example is the nitrate ore used in matches. Chinese merchants must pay a bill of lading fee of 6.5 yuan for every 5,000 catties, while foreign merchants are exempt. When their finished products leave the factory, national goods must pay likin and miscellaneous taxes. For example, in provinces such as Fujian and Sichuan, the miscellaneous taxes (excluding the regular tax) must be paid at more than half of the goods' price per case, while foreign matches do not require this. All of these are just a few examples that are commonly seen. The heavy and complex taxes are obviously evident, and the unequal treatment between Chinese and foreign merchants simply promotes the suicide of national goods factories. Sixth, we should naturally consider the blows that military disasters and bandits have given to the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors. China, a country based on agriculture, has a sad trend of relying on foreign countries for large agricultural products, which has been thoroughly discussed by Mr. Zhu Yinong, Tao Xisheng, Feng Ziming, and others. Due to the decline of agricultural products and the bankruptcy of rural areas, there are more soldiers and bandits. Due to the increase in soldiers and bandits, transportation is more obstructed and industries are more weakened. Looking around the country, thanks to the gifts of warlords and communists, there is almost no quiet place to live, let alone work happily. The losses that these military disasters and bandits have given to the industrial and commercial sectors cannot be calculated in numbers. If there is no way to effectively achieve unity and peace, the industrial and commercial sectors have absolutely no way to survive. Seventh, we must talk about the weaknesses of national goods factories themselves. The lack of capital concentration and the lack of cooperation between labor and capital have already been mentioned. In addition, most of the leaders have outdated minds and lack of knowledge. They neither know how to find talent nor do they know how to manage scientifically. They neither respect business ethics nor do they know how to cooperate. Except for a few with new ideas who can cope with this difficult environment, they are either acting impulsively or sighing helplessly, so that they are struggling to break out of this oppressive atmosphere (to be continued).</p>

<p>A—You were carousing at the brothel last night and didn’t get back until late into the night. Did your wife scold you?</p>
<p>B—No, no. The fact that I married a teacher is my great advantage. I was late coming home last night, and she was very civilized about it.

<h3 id="e178">Tragic Death of Chinese Student at Purdue University in America <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jianhou</p>
<p>In mid-August, this newspaper's international telegraph carried a news item about the tragic death of Chinese student C. K. Shun in a car accident at Purdue University in the United States. Purdue University is located in West Lafayette, Indiana, in the United States, and is a well-known private university. Chen Shugui, a relative and a student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, went to America last summer to study at that school. He and the aforementioned C. K. Shun, i.e., Sun Jiake, and Xu Baoquan, who died in the same car accident, were classmates and very good friends. The tragedy involving the two of them occurred while they were driving to Midesheng to welcome Chen. Although I did not kill Boren, Boren died because of me. Mr. Chen’s grief has reached its peak. He has entrusted me to tell readers about the beginning and end of the tragedy in the letter he sent to me.</p>
<p>Last year, there were more than 30 Chinese students at Purdue University, majoring in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and other subjects. After graduating this session, Mr. Chen went to an American factory in Midesheng for an internship during the summer vacation. As the internship was about to end, Mr. Xu and Mr. Sun wrote to Mr. Chen from West Lafayette, asking to drive their new car to Midesheng to welcome him back on a certain day. Mr. Chen waited for that day. Mr. Xu and Mr. Sun did drive from Lafayette toward Midesheng. Four Chinese classmates were sitting in the back seat of the car. They looked at the scenery along the way, sightseeing as they drove. They were in high spirits. However, Midesheng is an eleven-hour drive from Lafayette. Mr. Xu and his group left in the afternoon and estimated that they would not be able to reach their destination until midnight. Therefore, they stepped on the gas and drove quickly. They felt like they were flying, leaving the dust behind. Their speed had reached over sixty miles per hour. Unexpectedly, a car was driving towards them. Mr. Xu's car tried to avoid it, but it was too late to turn the engine off. Unexpectedly, the momentum was too fast, and the car suddenly lifted off the ground by a height of about ten feet. It overturned and rose up three times. The car was completely destroyed. Mr. Xu and Mr. Sun died tragically. When the car first overturned, the car’s awning was shattered by the impact. The four people sitting in the car were all thrown out, escaping with their lives. They were lucky.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu was from Minhou. He was previously a student at William Penn University in America. Mr. Sun was from Tianjin. He was previously a student at Nankai University in our country. The two men were only just over twenty years old. They were good at sports, proficient in music, skilled at photography, driving, and swimming. It is most regrettable that both men’s families were rich, and they themselves had exceptional talents. They studied diligently in their courses and their grades were outstanding. As a result, the teachers and students in the entire school praised them. Among the hundreds of graduates this session, forty-two students were awarded honors degrees. Only three of the Chinese students won this honor. Namely, Mr. Chen Shugui and the two deceased men. The three men were the same age, had the same ambitions, and went out together. They had only been classmates for a year, but they were as close as brothers. In their spare time after class, they often worked together to plan major projects for industrial salvation. They looked forward to returning home after completing their studies, building their motherland, and bringing happiness to society. Who would have thought that a sudden misfortune would strike and they would die tragically in a foreign country? It is heartbreaking. First, Mr. Sun's sister also had a car in America. When she left America to go to Europe this summer, her younger brother wanted it. His sister refused to give it to him, saying, “My brother likes to take risks, I’m afraid it will cause trouble.” How would she know that he would die because of it? Mr. Xu had been away from the country for a long time, and his 73-year-old father was looking forward to his beloved son’s return day and night. When the bad news came, he shed tears of grief and was heartbroken.</p>
<p>That day, Mr. Chen received the news and rushed back from Midesheng, weeping with grief. He helped Mr. Ke Zhongzheng, a ten-year friend of Mr. Xu, to take care of the funeral arrangements. On September 5, he held a funeral for the two men in Lafayette. On that day, Chinese and foreign relatives and friends, as well as teachers and students from Purdue, all came to pay their respects. The professors also wrote articles in the newspaper to mourn them, imagining that the two men's learning and morals were valued by their peers.</p>
<p>Mr. Ke and Mr. Xu’s sister escorted the remains of the two men back to China on the Queen of Asia on the 3rd of this month. They had previously entrusted my elder brother to arrange all the transfer matters, so that the bones could be buried in their homeland as soon as possible. If their souls are aware, may they return soon. I can’t help but feel a sense of sorrow when I touch this three-foot bronze coffin. Therefore, I wrote this account.</p>

<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Miss Qian Yunshan, the daughter of the renowned painter, Cloud Crane, possessed a deep-seated family artistic background. She excelled in painting and composing poetry. She once created a fan painted with flowers in the style of Nantian, exuding pure fragrance and elegance, untouched by contemporary trends. This fan eventually came to the attention of Li Youzhu. Youzhu, a distinguished gentleman from Luhe, deeply loved painting and calligraphy. After appreciating the fan, he was reluctant to part with it. Learning that Yunshan was still unmarried, he entrusted a friend to act as a matchmaker and propose marriage. The auspicious event was successfully arranged, and on the Double Tenth Festival this year, they celebrated the joy of their union. The new bride, carefully applying makeup, diligently prepared decorations before the wedding, creating four painted screens and a hanging scroll to adorn the bridal chamber. Each painting was accompanied by a poem, all fresh and delightful. For example, on the plum blossom, bamboo, and longevity belt painting, it was written: "Red plum blossoms and green bamboo fill the garden with spring; again, the Zhaohua blooms, witnessing the new year. Glad that the painting enhances longevity, bring it to wish health to the elders." On the lotus pond and kingfisher painting: "Ten miles of lotus pond after the rain; a dragonfly stays on a leaf. A kingfisher flies past, bringing poetic imagery; a painted boat carries wine for an evening cool stroll." On the autumn sunflowers and yellow bird painting: "Autumn sunflowers and dahlias compete in fragrance; brought from overseas, they are unusually beautiful. The small bird flies high, seemingly mistaking them for peonies, the Wei Purple and Yao Yellow." On the camellia and pair of sparrows painting: "Secluded in a small pavilion with heavy curtains, I only love to chant and drink. I remember the snow melting on the flower path, a pair of frozen sparrows chirping on the sunny eaves." The hanging scroll was inscribed with a five-character律 poem: "Painting learned from famous masters; prosperity appears before my eyes. The brocade hall is newly rich and noble; the Yao Island is a small paradise. Fortunately, the flowers are always beautiful; happily, we meet when the moon is full. Hanging high on the powder wall, may it wish for longevity." The auspicious language is particularly appropriate. Her calligraphy is also elegant and free. Such talent in a woman is rare. One can imagine the joy in the bridal chamber, no less than Zhao Songxue and Lady Guan, playfully working with clay, without distinction between "you" and "I." Such a beautiful and harmonious marriage adds another brilliant page to the history of tenderness.</p>

<p>— Shuangqiu</p>
<p>Nengren Temple is one of the Eight Heroic Daughters and Sons stories. Yiqiu plays Zhang Jinfeng. With light makeup and simple clothing, she perfectly embodies the charm of a young lady from a modest family. Both with heavy and light makeup, Yiqiu is beautiful, but this play is the most suitable for appreciating her natural beauty. She has many singing parts and her melodies are beautiful. When Thirteenth Sister proposes marriage, her expression is shy, pretending to laugh, and enchantingly beautiful. Paired with Furongcao's Thirteenth Sister, whose demeanor is poised and whose words are candid, they complement each other perfectly.</p>
<p>Mandarin Duck Tomb is a tragic play of the noblest, purest, and deepest love. Due to the lack of freedom in marriage and the constraints of old morality, yet without the courage to break free from the family, both sides devote themselves to love without return, and ultimately decide to sacrifice their lives for it. They are the most pitiful of infatuated lovers. Yiqiu plays Wang Wujie, with *Siping Diao*, seven-character *Erhuang*, and *Fan Erhuang*. The complexity and effort of her singing, and the novelty and mellowness of her melodies, surpass all other singing. Her tragic expression and sorrowful tone can cause viewers and listeners to grieve and shed tears uncontrollably. One can say her skills are divine. Having gained fame in Beijing and Shanghai, her performances are widely praised. This time, paired with Jiang Miaoxiang's Xie Zhaolang and Furongcao's Wang Sao, it is the perfect addition to perfection, truly a masterpiece of sorrow and beauty.</p>

<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>In the autumn of the year of Gengwu, I was about to open a personal painting exhibition in Shanghai. I spent my days painting and never put down my brush, which exhausted my spirit. Therefore, on the afternoon of the Mid-Autumn Festival, I went on a trip with more than ten female alumni from the Patriotic Girls' School. When we arrived at Paotaiwan, I went to Baoshan alone with four or five people. Baoshan borders the river and the sea, and is located at the intersection of the Yangtze and Huangpu Rivers. It is also close to Shanghai, so it should be a major town. However, the city is small and sparsely populated, seemingly unable to bear its desolation. We entered through the South Gate and got off the bus at the Drum Tower, which is the center of the city. To the west, we visited the elementary school, where the trees cast shadows and there was a beautiful terrace pond. To the south was the Public Education Center, which was converted from the City God Temple. Last year, the City God was said to have lost his head, which was widely rumored. Now, it has been completely swept away, while the City God in Shanghai remains majestic amidst the incense smoke, receiving the worship of the world. So, even gods can be fortunate or unfortunate. We visited the Normal School, which bordered the city wall. On top of the majestic battlements, there was a tower called Wangjiang (Looking at the River). The misty waves stretched as far as the eye could see, with three or five sailboats rising and falling in between. A line stretched across the horizon, which was Chongming Island. We exited through the West Gate and went to the park. The park was quite small. We followed the river embankment, where the deep grass reached our shins. The wooden stakes along the embankment resembled long combs. We entered through the North Gate and took a carriage back to Paotaiwan. We ate on a large rock on the abandoned embankment. A gentle breeze blew and the river water surged, leaping with a "xiong" sound. My fellow traveler, Chen Sheng, was startled and fled, but I stopped him and he stood there timidly. Everyone watching laughed joyously. As dusk fell, we walked to Wusong and took a bus back to school. After dinner, as the fun of the trip had not yet subsided, I gathered dozens of students and went out to admire the moon. We left the school and walked along Jiangwan Road, laughing and talking, running and galloping, until we returned from North Sichuan Road. At that time, the moon was as bright as a mirror, and the night was as cool as water, with wisps of clouds reluctant to leave the moonlight. The shadows of the trees swayed along the road, and we could occasionally hear the sounds of finger-guessing games from people's homes. When I returned to school, it was already late. I took out my unfinished painting and added some finishing touches. The moonlight shone in through the cracks in the window, as if comforting my loneliness.</p>

<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>Continuing to look closer, I realized that all were oil painted scenes. The upper part of the scenery directly reaches the skylight of the circular building, taking light to match the outdoors. A mud ditch is built below, arranging the scenes of the Waterloo area of that year. Lying horizontally in the soil were all wounded soldiers and dead horses, with blurred blood and flesh...too gruesome to look at. Each part of the painting has an explanation. This picture was made by the Belgian academic painter Di Sansi, using realistic brushwork and impressionistic colors. It is praised as a great picture, and the painting style is also novel. It cannot be compared with ordinary scene paintings. After finishing the visit, we went forward to see the monuments erected by various countries. After walking about five miles, we saw another monument. Beside the monument were carved drooping..., also objects commemorating Napoleon. Today's Waterloo, fields connected by ridges, is wide and open for dozens of miles. Only a few monuments remain. Only the place name is known to the world. All foreigners who come to Belgium are eager to visit. I visited there for four hours, only arousing a sense of history.</p>
<p>The city hall of the three capitals of Belgium. The city halls of most European countries are famous buildings in history. The city hall of Beijing, Belgium, was built in Gothic style (the style of ancient Rome). The solemn grandeur and the exquisite details of its carvings can be compared with the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Opposite is the old White Palace, with a square in the middle. There are dozens of flower stalls in the square. The famous flowers are blooming, set off by the lofty and elegant architecture, which is particularly spectacular. Entering the city hall through the square, you need to buy a ticket to visit. Entering the interior, no matter where you look, it is beautiful. Dozens of portraits of celebrities are displayed on the walls, all painted by Dutch painters. To the right, there is another hall. Sixteen woven portraits are hung on the four walls. The weaving is extremely exquisite, and the combination of light and color is appropriate. Looking at it from a distance, it is like a famous painting. It is almost impossible to distinguish it as a woven object. From here, enter the council hall. Antique tables and chairs are placed in the middle. The four walls are inlaid with famous paintings. The remaining utensils are also extremely delicate. From the council hall to the right, enter several offices in the city hall. There are also famous paintings on the walls. Finally, visit a chapel, which is set up for the people in the hall to offer new prayers. In the center of the hall, there is an image of Jesus, and several candlestick holders are placed below, like the temples in our country. The light in the hall is not bright, and the furnishings are neat, which makes people feel solemn. After leaving the city hall, take a tram to the suburbs near Beijing, Belgium. The place name is Lagu. There is a park there. The garden is only a little more than ten acres, with exotic flowers competing to bloom and green trees covering the sky. Behind the park is a forest, separated by a lake, which does not allow visitors to pass. Artificial beauty and natural beauty are far away from each other. It is truly a great place for tourists to rest. Then, walk along the avenue to the right outside the park for twenty minutes and arrive at another park. This park has a Chinese pagoda, which is dozens of feet high, and several Japanese-style pavilions. It is said that this was transported from the Panama Fair in the past. There is also an Oriental Art Museum, which displays Chinese and Japanese antiques. The visit was hurried, and I did not remember it. The Lagu area has royal residences. The road is extremely clean, and the trees planted along the road are neat. There are also woods for pedestrians to pass through. In the shadows of the setting sun, it is especially lovely. I lingered in the deep forest and forgot to return until dusk before returning to the hostel.</p>

<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Diary of a Tour of Italy</p>
<p>(3) Ten Days in Rome (1)</p>
<p>— The Immortal City — La Vile eternelle —</p>
<p>June 1st — Exhibition of Spanish Masterpieces and Exhibition of Modern Japanese Paintings</p>
<p>We arrived in Rome early in the morning of June 1st. When we finished the 36-hour long journey and walked into this immortal ancient city, we all felt very happy. Especially I, who had a passionate admiration for the things in Rome, felt very proud.</p>
<p>Leaving the station, we were led by a guide who spoke broken French to a hotel not far from the station to stay. He said that this was a hotel where French people used to live. It cost twelve lire per person per day. The rooms were also tall and elegant. Everyone was very satisfied. This road is called Via Principe Vmberto, which is a ten-minute walk from the train station. It is very convenient to go anywhere. This is considered a suitable location in Rome.</p>
<p>Rome, which I had been looking forward to for many years, was finally realized. We were all eager to walk into that beautiful, grand, and mysterious treasure house. So, after washing up at the hotel, we hurried out. When walking on the streets of Rome, it was like being completely separated from the modern world. Everywhere we saw ruins and stone pillars. Those ancient Roman cultural relics, exposed to the wind and rain for a long two to three thousand years, were transmitted to our eyes. We couldn't help but see ourselves as a small, short, and impermanent illusion, just passing by in front of it. Not only the ancient relics, but also the houses, shops, and walls along the way were all dark tea-yellow. Under the bright sunlight, they showed a desolate and ancient atmosphere. However, in all this ancient appearance, the windows and doors of all the houses were painted with jade-like eye-piercing bright green. Just like walking in the alleys of Beijing and seeing the big red doors everywhere, there was a similar sting.</p>
<p>Walking to the center of the stone-paved square in front of the station, we took the No. MP public motorcycle to the New Art Museum to see the Spanish masterpiece exhibition. This was what we had inquired and learned about when we were leisurely planning today's itinerary on the road. We knew that today was Italy's Unification Day, and all museums and art galleries were closed. Therefore, we planned to see the Spanish famous painting exhibition in the morning and the Japanese modern art exhibition in the afternoon. Today, the Italians are enthusiastically celebrating their National Founding Day. The Italian flag with red, white, and green colors is flying all over the streets. The naive and optimistic citizens who permeate the entire city of Rome are singing their national anthem. A burst of applause and a burst of shouts, joy poured out from their hearts like flowing water. I have rarely seen such an atmosphere. The motorcycle twisted and turned up and down. The stone pillars, fountains, and sculptures in the squares everywhere were always surprising.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Gold Market in a Hesitant State <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Market conditions contain a lazy component</p>
<p>Silver prices may rebound</p>
<p>A glance at the gold market situation yesterday, the 13th, showed a hesitant trend, with ups and downs. There were fluctuations of one or two taels, with a difference of more than six taels throughout the day. Foreign exchange seemed to be secretly easing, with banks initially selling and then paying back, and listed prices remained unchanged. As for the psychology of the industry, it was strong on the surface but soft inside. The market was mixed with buying and selling. In the morning, Yongkang, Yuancheng, Yongyuanxingyong, etc., made some purchases, while Hengxing, Yuansheng, Fuchang, etc., all sold out. The market opened high in the morning, once reaching 569 taels, because the overseas silver market had reported a decline the day before. Afterwards, as large households sold off, especially with the easing of exchange rates, the market turned downward, falling by more than three taels. Later, Yuansheng, Dadecheng, and others sold off, while Shunli, Hengxing, Shengda, etc., bought. However, the market was weak and suddenly fell below 63 taels. Exchange rates felt even more sluggish. Finally, there seemed to be a sign of easing. In short, with the swap period approaching, there may not be any major changes. The front and back market situations are listed below:</p>
<p>A tense start: The opening price for November was 568.5 taels, an increase of 2.8 qian compared to last Saturday. This was because the large silver strip returned to a low of 1/16, and the silver price actually fell by 3%. However, there was no special news in the European market. Afterwards, there were fluctuations of one or two taels. The gross profit rose from 67.6 qian to 68.8 qian. This was because the banks' payment and receipt were different. Soon afterwards, Fuchang, Hengxing, and Taichang all sold out. Selling twelve-month British gold at 7.5 pence was advantageous. The Huashang Bank could sell November at the same price, so it fell again. The shilling was revealed but did not move, so it dropped to 66.78 qian. Soon after, there was a fluctuation of two taels. At 10 o'clock, it was raised to 7.5 qian. Yuan Yue, Yingjin, Xingye, and Datong traded at 7.5625 pence. People continued to sell after that. The Huabi once sold twelve-month Donghui for 1.26 qian. However, people's hearts were downstream, so it was cut back by two taels. At 10:30, it was 65.67 qian. After the forward trades came in, it seemed to be rising. After 11 o'clock, it rose by one tael, calculated as 66.9 qian. But the sellers were still not lazy, and the exchange rate finally eased. This month, British gold could settle at 7.4375 pence, and the forward price was 625 pence. At noon, the market closed at 65.3 qian. Yuancheng and others chased sales, continuing to do small amounts in the 5 tael range. The revealed price was still 615 taels, a discount of 48 to 50 taels.</p>
<p>A loose and stagnant ending: The back market opened at 64.7 qian. Then, it rose from 4.6 qian to 5.3 qian. The market was flat. However, the Indian exchange saw a small change. Soon after, Yuancheng and others tended to sell, falling by more than one tael, calculated as 63.78 qian. Then, banks traded recent British gold at 7.5 pence. Afterwards, the Huabi entered January at 625 pence. At around 3 o'clock, it rose to 64.45 qian. The selling positions moved, and British gold weakened. January must be calculated at 6875 pence. Some of the same industry sold to the Huabi and others, so the gold price had secretly declined. At about 3:30, it ended at 62.4 qian. In an instant, someone paid in and returned to a high of about two taels, calculated as 3.4 qian. Until 4 o'clock, it fell back to 2.5 qian. Afterwards, Hengxing entered the market and bought, so it was raised by more than one tael. It soared to 64.12 qian. At about 4:30, the market closed at 63.9 qian, a decrease of 1.8 qian compared to last Saturday. It has been falling for many days, totaling 8 taels. The highest price in one day was 68.8 qian, and the lowest price was 62.4 qian, a difference of 6.4 qian. The revealed price was still pressing down by a small 51 taels. The logged prices were 69 taels in October, 65 taels in November, and 59 taels for the water. In the afternoon, 68 taels of goods opened at 8 taels in the morning, 5 taels at noon, 4.6 qian in the afternoon, and 3.5 qian at the close.</p>
<p>Complex buying and selling: The transactions and receipts of each firm were different. Yongfeng, Yongkang, Yuanxingyong, Yuancheng Yong, and forward trades all entered. Hengxing, Shengda, Chunyuanyong, Zhifengyong, Yuancheng, and Xinheng all exited. Yuanmaoyong, Hengli, Dadecheng, Wanxing, and others had erratic entries and exits. In the afternoon, Hengxing, Fuchang, and Shunli all entered. Yuancheng, Xuchang, and retail all exited. Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, and others had occasional entries and exits. The Dalian gang bought 500 bars and sold more than 300. The Guangdong gang sold more than 1,000 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Foreign Exchange Listings are Close to and Far From Shortening <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Internal trading turned loose from firm... Transaction amounts vary. Yesterday, the HSBC listings, the near-term each exchange except Hong Kong reduced by two-five, calculated at eighty-two taels three-five outside, the rest were not changed. However, the bank bought four-month terms, British gold reduced by one-two-five, to one shilling eight pence one-two-five to three-seven-five, US dollars reduced by two-five, calculated at forty yuan zero-five to forty-one yuan. Francs were lowered by five yuan, calculated at one thousand fifty yuan. As for overseas silver markets, due to the fact that it was Monday, there was no telegram, and Kobe exchange rates were flat. As for the domestic trading of British, American, and Japanese exchanges, they were firm in the morning and then loose, and in the afternoon the volume shrank, because the gold market turned from a boom to a slump. Comparing the results with last Saturday (the 11th), British gold was slightly longer by zero-six-two-five, forward price was recommended longer by one-two-five, US dollars were longer by one-two-five to two-five, Japanese gold was lowered by six-two-five but the gold market fell by two taels. Chinese merchants, speculators, and gold businesses generally closed with the British gold trades. It is estimated that about 200,000 pounds were traded. In the morning, banks such as Anda, Youli, Sumitomo, and Xingye all sold out. In the afternoon, Huabi, Taiwan. Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Youli all entered. The banks traded tens of thousands of pounds with each other. Also, the US dollars were settled by various banks in the morning, with more than 100,000 yuan sold by Anda, Yuntong, etc., and more than 100,000 yuan was resold in the afternoon, which was absorbed by Mitsubishi. Only, the trading of the East Exchange was less shallow. The Dalian gang had no intention of entering or exiting, and the exchange rate seemed to be secretly easing. The overseas silver market may have hopes of rising.</p>
<p>British exchange internal trade prices ranged by 1,875, and trading was still active. The bid prices for October and November were one shilling seven pence three-one-two-five, December was three-seven-five, and January was four-three-seven-five, and the buying prices were all increased by zero-six-two-five.

<h3 id="e187">Securities, 1929 Customs Duties Dropped Sharply by Three Yuan <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were few spot transactions for various bonds, and the futures market was also leisurely. The buyers and sellers were quite calm. The front market had few entries and exits, and the supply and demand were very flat. Except for the 1929 customs duties, which fell by five or six jiao when they opened, the other fluctuated and had little change. Compared with the end of last week, there was a change of only a few jiao. In the afternoon, a certain merchant had a huge amount of sales of the 1929 customs duties, while the buyers waited and watched, and the decline was very strong. Each market trended lower. As a result, it fell by a huge 3.2 yuan. The others also carried lower, but the trend was still peaceful. Compared with last week's reduction in military strength, the November futures for 1929 cigarettes and the customs duties and demobilization were all down by about one jiao.

<p>The yarn market is slightly firm, but the overall situation remains calm. The price of American cotton’s Three Grades of yarn has risen, leading some people to become bullish. However, the current yarn sales have not seen a significant increase, and the price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn has recently fallen sharply due to accumulated inventory. The previous purchases by Sichuan and Gaoyang groups are now being sold off, making the current yarn market extremely weak. There is a risk of further price declines in the future, as prices are too high and business could stop at any moment. However, forward contracts are relatively tight due to a lack of sellers, although most people are bearish. It is said that one manufacturer's attitude remains firm and unchanged.</p>
<p>In recent months, the "Ren Biao" market has rebounded slightly. At the opening of the "Ren Biao" market, due to the continuous rise of American cotton, there were not many sellers in the market, and the atmosphere was relatively tight. Prices rose by three, four, five, and nine "qian" respectively. In the afternoon, it was reported that the price of Three Grades of yarn had risen slightly, with prices rising by two, three, and five "qian" for each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 11,950 bales. It was found that Dafeng sold 700 bales, Daji 400 bales, Taichang 400 bales, Shenchang 400 bales, Yiyu 450 bales, and the rest 200 bales. Yuande bought 800 bales, Yichang 550 bales, Yuda 400 bales, and Yijun 450 bales. The closing prices of "Ren Biao" are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Ren Biao Closing Price - Price Change - Inventory</p>
<p>October: 1525, up 1027, 1501</p>
<p>November: 1517, 938, 401</p>
<p>December: 1516, 958, 200</p>
<p>January: 1315, up 733, 800</p>
<p>January: 1517, 721, 150</p>
<p>March: 1520, 54, 400</p>
<p>Current yarn sales are 1,200 bales. Current yarn sales are still good. It was found that the total purchase volume of various groups throughout the day was 1,200 bales. Fellow merchants took in 545 bales, with daily yarn prices falling by one or two "liang." Among the customer groups, the mainland took in 250 bales, Guangdong 300 bales, Luzhou 60 bales, Changsha 75 bales, Sichuan 40 bales, Shantou 120 bales, Yunnan 90 bales, Hankou 55 bales, and miscellaneous groups 140 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Cotton Market Shows Signs of Rebound <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending upward, with a sudden rebound. This is because the American cotton situation has stabilized, and the declining trend has subsided. Therefore, Japanese merchants are taking the opportunity to buy up large quantities, about 20,000 "dan" in two days. With such a large volume of purchases, the market has been emptied, and the atmosphere is relatively tight. In addition, some people believe that the American cotton rescue organization and the Japanese merchants' buying spree are temporarily a positive sign, with prices possibly reaching 32 "liang" for each month. However, current cotton transactions are still light. Future steps will still depend on the American flower situation and actual sales.</p>
<p>The "Han Biao" market rebounded by four "qian." At the opening of the "Han Biao" market, due to the continuous rise of American cotton, there were few sellers in the market, and the atmosphere was relatively tight. Prices rose by 0.25 "qian" for each month. In the afternoon, Japanese merchants and some others bought up large quantities, and the market atmosphere became even stronger, with prices rising by 0.15 to 0.2 "qian" respectively. The total transaction volume for the day was 61,900 "dan."

<h3 id="e191">Indian Cotton Purchases by Japanese Merchants Remain Strong <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Due to political reasons, the Bombay market was closed for three days last week, with little business. Prices followed the weakness of American cotton, but brokers and exporters bought when prices fell, which hindered the downward trend. Export demand remains good, with transactions in Oomra and Pingul cotton. There have also been inquiries from Europe. It is reported that as of October 3rd, Japan has purchased 800 bales of new cotton and 7,500 bales of old cotton. The statistics for the past week are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1929 | 1930</p>
<p>Accumulated receipts since September 1st | 77 | 78</p>
<p>Existing at the end of the week | 68 | 64</p>
<p>Accumulated exports since September 1st | 16 | 62</p>
<p>Exports to Europe | 26 | 3</p>
<p>Exports to China | 6 | 48</p>
<p>Exports to Japan | 72 | 125</p>
<p>Exports to other regions | 6 | 2</p>
<p>The spot market in Liverpool was quiet last week. Futures were not affected by the US government's cotton report, which was not beyond general expectations. Short selling was slight, but buying on dips was also not weak. The market situation throughout the week was unremarkable. Egyptian cotton prices fell slightly due to a cotton harvest report favorable to sellers.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Grain and Rice Market Remains Weak <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>In Zhabei, over a hundred boats arrived over the past few days, causing congestion due to abundant supply, and prices fell accordingly. New japonica rice has been gradually declining since the Double Tenth Festival, with a total drop of one yuan. Yesterday, it weakened by another 0.20 to 0.30 yuan. Top-grade rice has already entered the inner city at 17 yuan, opening at around 16.80 yuan.</p>
<p>The general trend for average grades stabilized during the evening session due to slightly improved demand. New indica rice turned flat yesterday, with no price movement. However, in the previous two sessions, it fell by 0.80 to 0.90 yuan following the trend of western japonica rice. Currently, special top-grade rice opens at 14.60 to 14.70 yuan, with a mediocre market situation. The supply of "Du Jian" rice is not abundant, and existing inventory has not been selling well, leaving room for further price adjustments. Special high-grade rice barely opens at 13 yuan. The market for "Yang Xian" rice has settled after the price decline. Inquiries are still strong in this street, with prices opening at 12.40 to 12.50 yuan. It is found that this year's harvest in Zhejiang province is very abundant. There is no prospect of strong sales of this "Yang Du Jian" rice in Zhejiang province, so it would not be surprising if it continues to soften in the future. Special customer-grade rice opens at 11 yuan, while medium-grade rice is only around 9.50 yuan. The overall situation is still weak, with a decline of about 0.20 yuan yesterday. Shipments of "Bu Jian" rice are slightly scarce, and small lots are still being sold. The high price is 11.50 yuan, with a weary outlook. "Bai Yuan" rice is stagnant, with sluggish sales, and has declined by as much as one yuan since the festival. Currently, the high price is 16.30 to 16.40 yuan. New "Yin Yuan" rice only has sporadic supply, which is maintaining demand, so the market has remained stable throughout. Top-grade rice is at 15.60 yuan.</p>
<p>In Shanghai South, over thirty boats arrived yesterday. Sales in this street are extremely weak. "Chang Bang" new rice continued to fall by 0.30 yuan, opening at 16.30 to 16.40 yuan. "Su Tong Bang" rice is also softening, with high-grade rice returning to the 15 yuan range. Transactions are few, and the market trend is poor. "Nan Bang Qing Jiao" and other kiln varieties of indica rice are arriving in increasing quantities, with sluggish sales. Merchants are eager to sell off their inventory, so prices have been continuously cut. Yesterday, it fell by another 0.30 to 0.40 yuan. The general price here is 13.50 to 13.60 yuan. As for "Ting Lin" and other white rice, although demand is weak, prices have only softened slightly due to low supply. "Yang Jian" rice mostly opens at 10.08 to 10.09 yuan, while high-grade "Du Jian" rice is at 12.00 yuan, with a drop of 0.20 to 0.30 yuan. The overall trend is extremely weak. High-grade rice from factory machines is priced at around 10 yuan. There is some demand from rural areas, and the market is also softening.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Distant Futures for Flour Enter the 3 Qian Range <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw a consistent and sharp decline in all months. The recent months were particularly hard hit by factory sell-offs. Distant future contracts, particularly those for January and February, saw a gradual decline, falling to as low as 2 taels 2 qian 9.5 fen, entering the 2 taels 3 qian range. Contracts for December to February all approached the 2 taels 3 qian level. This was due to renewed reports of falling prices for imported foreign wheat, and the market sentiment was already bearish. In addition to foreign wheat already arrived at port, factories were expecting two more shipments to arrive soon, prompting widespread sell-offs. Customer demand stalled, and the market consensus was for further declines, leading to a general weakness. At the close, the contracts for October and November each fell by 3 fen, December by 2 fen, January by 2.25 fen, February by 1.75 fen, and March by 2.5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Recent Wheat Prices Plummet by 5-6 Fen <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The wheat market yesterday opened with a weak price. Continuing reports of arriving foreign wheat and further discounts on foreign wheat prompted Shanghai merchants to continue to place orders at attractive prices. Some factories immediately hedged by selling futures, further depressing the market. In the afternoon, market sentiment turned even more bearish, and prices continued to fall. At the close, October contracts were down by 6 fen, November by 5 fen, December by 3 fen, January by 2 fen, February by 3 fen, and March by 4 fen. While the supply of domestic bran and wheat is limited, existing stockpiles are sufficient. The arrival of more foreign wheat is further dampening the market. Yesterday, Fufeng Factory purchased nearly 10,000 packages of wheat from Niuzhuang, Yaowan, Shashi, and Jiangbei, causing prices to fall by another 1 qian.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Silk and Tea Processing in Shanghai Still Struggling to Improve <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's raw silk market in Shanghai continued to show some firmness. European firms are reportedly buying Shanghai white raw silk futures, but factory silk costs are still high, and they are unwilling to sell at a loss. Furthermore, raw material supplies are dwindling, making transactions increasingly difficult. Yesterday, only Dachang and others halted trades for 30 packages of Shanghai white raw silk futures. Kechang purchased 8 packages of yellow coarse silk, and prices remained firm.</p>
<h3 id="e196">High-Grade Zhenmei Tea from Gaozhuang Sees Slight Movement in Sales to France <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sales of high-grade Zhenmei green tea from Gaozhuang, Wuyuan, to French firms showed slight improvement. Top-quality "Chouxin" tea opened at 200 taels, unchanged from last week. However, tea from Tunxi and Suian areas fell by another 2-3 taels. Jinlong Foreign Firm also slightly increased its purchases of "Fengmei" and "Zhucha" teas from larger wholesalers, but prices were extremely low. Tongfu has already begun processing Qimen black tea, and the Russian Aid Association began sampling tea yesterday, suggesting a potential for business. However, tea market prices are currently at extremely low levels. The overall trend has already reached its limits.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Melton Cloth, Used for Western Suits and Uniforms, is Scarce and Pricey <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Melton cloth, specifically used for Western suits and uniform tops, comes in both plain and patterned varieties, with varying quality. Lower-grade cloths sell for only 1.1-1.2 taels per yard, while higher-grade cloths, such as those from Deke and Dulanxiang, can sell for 2.25 taels. Current market sales are exceptionally strong, and the Cloth Guild's sales prices have also increased sharply. Large transactions are currently difficult to secure, as existing inventories are low, and sellers are raising prices in anticipation of higher profits. Compared to last year, prices have increased by over 3 qian per yard. Those seeking "Changqing" fabric must also add a few fen. Plain-colored cloths are also extremely firm. Yesterday, Hwa Kee, Hwa Po, and An Lee brands were sold at 1.9 taels net, while Taihe's top-grade "Flower" brand was at 2.05 taels, and the second-grade was at 1.55 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Mixed Fortunes for Domestic and Foreign Piece Goods <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>There have been no significant changes for locally produced fabrics recently. However, Hubei "Tian Zi Zu" cloth is in short supply, selling for 8.35 taels yesterday. Coarse twill from Tianjin and Henan is seeing increased activity. "Mao Ying" suddenly faces demand exceeding supply, opening at 5.05 taels. Fine cloth remains sluggish, with "Lan Shuang Yu" opening at 6.85 taels, "Yang He Cai Qiu" at 6.825 taels, and "Lan Ji" at 6.65 taels, with extremely poor sales. Bleached cloth has recently become slightly more active, with merchants from this street and Ningbo and Tianjin purchasing. "Jin San Ta" is selling for 7.4 taels, and "Yun Wai Piao Xiang" for 7.6 taels, though velvet is slightly soft.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western piece goods softened yesterday. The previous sharp increase in prices led to sluggish actual sales, causing market sentiment to suddenly become bearish. Yesterday, "Zhi Gong Ni" fell by 2.5 li, with "Mo Qian Shan" opening at 3 qian 1 fen 7 li 5 hao, "La Yan" at 3 qian 2 fen 2 li 5 hao, and "Shuang Tong Lu" at 2 qian 9 fen. Fine broadcloth remains firm, with "Hu Xin Ting" still opening at 2 qian 9 fen 5 hao, and "Zi Jin Shan" at 2 qian 9 fen 2 li 5 hao. However, "Tu Lan Hui" fell by 7.5 li to 1 fen due to abundant supply. "Zhi Gong Duan" saw a sharp decline, with lower-quality goods falling by 2.5 li to 5 li, while higher-quality goods remained unchanged. Among all goods, only the "Four Gentlemen" "Zhi Gong Ni" from both domestic and foreign factories stands out, opening at 2 qian 8 fen yesterday. Western goods remain sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Southern and Northern Goods: Black Dates and Walnuts Available <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Since the new crop of black dates became available, the volume of recent arrivals has increased sharply. It is estimated that the Shandong cargo ship delivered thousands of packages that have yet to be released. Yesterday, southern market businesses released over seventy packages of previous crop dates, priced at eleven taels, a slight easing compared to before. Yesterday, more than one hundred packages of new Jinan walnuts were sold for ten taels and two qian. The market was still active and the trend remained flat.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Metals and Bamboo Products: "Jie Gang" Steel Continues to Fall <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Since the arrival of "Zhu Jie Gang" steel resulted in sluggish inventory, prices have been declining. Recently, the downward trend has not stopped, with prices continuing to fall. The current market price for standard patterns is 85 taels, and even better-quality patterns are only valued at 90 taels. It is reported that construction companies such as Xin Jin Ji and Feng Tai Xing have been receiving shipments in recent days, resulting in limited demand. The market is reporting daily sales of only 70 to 80 tons.</p>

However, Buping overhears this and comes to her rescue alone. The henchmen are terrified at the sight of him because they have all been defeated by him in the past.

Although there are dozens of henchmen, none can get close to him. Zhou Long is extremely anxious and orders Huang Yong to help. However, Huang Yong is soon knocked down by Buping. In the end, Buping accidentally triggers a mechanism and is captured. This scene is tightly paced, the mechanism is ingenious, and the performances are realistic.

<p>— Su Ling</p>
<p>(13) Drunken Night</p>
<p>Every day, I am woken up very early by my classmates to go sketching in the countryside.</p>
<p>At night, everyone is idle. After several hours of chatting, we go to bed. This time, Mr. Feng and Mr. Liao invited me out for a bite to eat or a drink.</p>
<p>We left the inn and walked through some dark streets, looking for a relatively clean restaurant.</p>
<p>"Outside the North Gate, when I came back from sketching during the day, I saw a Tianjin-style restaurant. It's good and cheap," Liao said.</p>
<p>"What's it called?"</p>
<p>"I forgot the name, but we'll know when we get there. It's opposite a tall building, yes, opposite a photo studio."</p>
<p>"Is it far? It's already nine o'clock," I said.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, what does it matter?"</p>
<p>So we went looking.</p>
<p>It was a small Tianjin canteen. We went in and took a table.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, we were drinking.</p>
<p>"How is this northern cuisine, Mr. Xu, can you get used to it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's very good, very good," I said, picking up a piece of spicy chicken. "This, I think this is very delicious, but that fish is not bad either."</p>
<p>"Drink, drink."</p>
<p>So everyone drank a few glasses. The waiter brought a second pot, then a third pot of wine.</p>
<p>"Let's get drunk tonight, we won't stop until we're drunk."</p>
<p>"Why? Getting drunk is annoying."</p>
<p>I used to be able to drink a bit, but after getting very drunk once during the Lunar New Year, I didn't want to drink anymore. In recent years, although I often went to a small restaurant with a few friends for a glass or two, I never dared to drink too much. Tonight's amount of alcohol is probably the most I've had in years. I was very afraid of getting dizzy, and tried hard to stay calm, but Feng was already a bit excitedly confused.</p>
<p>"Let's not drink anymore, it's getting late. Isn't there a curfew after twelve o'clock?"</p>
<p>So we left the restaurant, and stumbled drunkenly through the dark alleys, only Liao was relatively sober, because he drank less. Feng was really drunk, staggering, talking excitedly, his drunken breath wafting in the night air.</p>

<p>"Haha, Mr. Xu, I, I tell you, my" woman is from your hometown, she loves me, but she doesn't understand me at all, she doesn't understand my art..."</p>
<p>"People are all the same, I have been deceived by people...I had a glorious past, now I am silent, no, my heart has not been cold because of silence...Why do I engage in art...But my woman doesn't understand me..."</p>
<p>Groping along the dark street, we stumbled back to the inn, Feng not stopping his talking.</p>
<p>(14) Mountain Climbing</p>
<p>I haven't climbed a mountain in two or three years. Although I am not old, my behavior seems to have aged. But this time, climbing a mountain with this group of young people (actually, I am also young), I felt very excited.</p>
<p>Before climbing the mountain, everyone bought a wooden staff.</p>
<p>This is a mountain with no people and no temples. Although it is not very high, it is steep, so going up is not very easy.</p>
<p>So everyone started to climb.</p>
<p>I hadn't reached a third of the way, and I was already very weak, clinging to branches, climbing with almost both hands as feet, panting, my heart pounding violently, and resting on the ground. But there were still people behind me. Fat Feng and Miss Zi in her high heels were really exhausted.</p>
<p>So I remembered the courage and strength I had two years ago in Nanjing, walking from Xuanwu Lake to Zijin Mountain, climbing to the highest peak, and then walking back to the city gate. I really felt that I am old now, my youth has passed.</p>
<p>No, I must continue to climb up. I want to restore my youthful enthusiasm and courage. I want to climb up, I want to boast to the young people, although I am your teacher—a teacher who has broken his innocence—but my spirit and body are still as lively, passionate, and brave as yours...</p>
<p>Finally, everyone reached the summit.</p>
<p>The wind blew our sweat-soaked clothes, soothing the brave but exhausted energy of this group of children. The forest was howling, and the blurred scenery unfolded before our eyes.</p>
<p>We all lay down to rest, looking up at the sky, the sun shining on us.</p>
<p>Yang was the first to climb up, waving a small flag. Song never seemed to know fatigue. He brought his painting gear, a thermos of hot water, and food to satisfy his hunger. When he reached the summit, he set up his easel and started painting. But I really admired Miss Yu's courage in climbing to the top of the mountain in high heels.</p>
<p>After the fatigue of resting subsided slightly, the sun was gradually setting in the west. We all tidied up our clothes and prepared to descend the mountain, but Song's painting was not yet finished.</p>
<p>"Mr. Xu, don't rush, come and revise the painting. Let those who walk slowly go first."</p>
<p>So I quickly revised it for him. He packed up his things, a large pile on his back, and ran down a steep, straight mountain path. When the people who left first were still at the foot of the mountain, he was already shouting down below.</p>
<p>Going down the mountain was easier than going up, but the fatigue was probably even greater than going up, and our mouths were excessively parched. So we asked a village family for cool water to drink.</p>
<p>The village women were very shy and curious, peeking at us. Several large dogs barked wildly.</p>

<h3 id="e225">Fudan Re-Joins Jiangda Movement <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Less than two weeks after the start of this semester, I heard students talking about Fudan re-joining the Jiangda Movement. The arrival of this good news really surprised and delighted me. Wasn't Fudan a member of the Jiangda Association before? Due to some small matters, they developed the intention to withdraw. Now they are willing to re-join. There is nothing between the two sides. It shows that everyone can understand and eliminate previous private opinions, and focus on the international position. I can't help but feel fortunate for the future of Chinese sports. Of course, it is not because Fudan joins that the future of Chinese sports can be celebrated, it is because everyone can be self-aware and willing to work together.</p>
<p>Now let me talk about the recent sports situation at Fudan.</p>
<p>Here I must first make a statement. Fudan was not unconcerned with sports before. Due to the withdrawal from the Jiangda Games, there were fewer places to participate and perform, and heroes had no place to use their talents. Interest in various sports was relatively diluted.</p>
<p>After this re-joining, less than two weeks after the start of school, notices about sports on campus were visible everywhere. The school and private organizations were recruiting soldiers and selecting players, holding meetings... in a variety of ways, making a lot of noise. Some of them even set up women's sections.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to popularize student sports, the school held a championship competition for various colleges, which is currently underway. Private organizations are also challenging each other.</p>
<p>There is no need for me to say more about the reputation of cross-country running in Shanghai. Everyone knows it. Every evening and morning, on Xiangyin Road and by the racetrack, you can see a group of brave and vigorous athletes competing and running to create their records.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that on campus, during extracurricular time, clusters of male and female students are practicing their ball skills on the sports field. It seems that one must have a strong physique to study. (Qing)</p>

<h3 id="e226">Picasso on Art Books <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Chen Deming</p>
<p>Picasso, a strange talent in the modern French art world, is a great painter of the Post-Impressionist school, the leader of Cubism, and the founder of Fauvism. He is truly a versatile person. It is most appropriate to call him the Don Juan (a versatile and handsome man praised in the poems of Byron, the great poet) in the art world. However, because his art is infinitely changeable, his attitude is extremely elusive. A mysterious mist often surrounds him, making it difficult for people to see his true face. The main reason is that he usually only paints and does not speak. Recently, he suddenly became interested and wrote a long book on art, which was reprinted in the famous French art magazine Formes. In this letter, he fully revealed his artistic views, and made every effort to ridicule and scold the current general hypocrisy in art. The importance and value of this letter goes without saying. Therefore, I urgently translated it to share with readers. (The following is Picasso's letter) Translator's note.</p>
<p>People usually think of me as an explorer.</p>
<p>I don't explore, I just discover occasionally.</p>
<p>Some people have turned Cubism into a physical exercise. We see weak people pretending to be physically strong every day. They think that by turning things into squares, they can obtain the effect of "strength". My most logical works, made with all my strength, are taken by them to produce mechanical things devoid of reality.</p>
<p>For example, you see "a famous Cubist painter", he is a person who "achieved his goal".</p>
<p>Around 1900, his father said to him, "My son, I will send you to Paris to learn new art." He obeyed. As soon as he arrived in Paris, he began to produce new art works. These new art works are comparable to the art works in "Spring Magazine" (referring to low-level French art, which Picasso cites to ridicule the new art writer).</p>
<p>You can imagine how much it pains me to see people imitating my art, my works, and even my methods.</p>
<p>One day, several clever Surrealist writers saw several sketches and pencil drawings in my sketchbook with only a few dots and lines. The facts are as follows - I greatly admired astronomical charts. I discovered a sense of beauty in them beyond their scientific representation. Therefore, one day I started to draw a picture with many dots connected by lines, and some dots not connected by lines, representing the stars in the sky. My intention was to use this composition in a realistic work in the future as part of it. But these Surrealists, oh, they are really smart, they all said in a firm tone that these compositions fit their abstract ideas.</p>
<p>I remember an event that happened in 1925, when several friends insisted on inviting me to visit that absurd exhibition representing low-level taste, although it had some educational value - the International Exhibition of Decorative Arts. They said to me, "Picasso, you will see that all the products there are influenced by you. You will find yourself in it. You will recognize that those works are your handiwork." They said this probably to please me.</p>
<p>Imagine Michael Angelo being invited to a banquet by several friends, and those friends standing up to welcome him and saying, "We have just had someone send over -</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>a Renaissance-era dish rack made only under the inspiration of your Moses statue." What kind of expression should Michael Angelo have on his face in this situation?</p>
<p>It is foolish for a person to seek inspiration from the works of his contemporaries. Every time I find myself being imitated, I almost feel a physical discomfort.</p>
<p>Decorative art has nothing in common with easel painting. The former is a utilitarian thing, and the latter is a noble pastime. The meaning of a chair is that a person can lean their back on it. This is a product, not art.</p>
<p>In 1906, Cezanne's influence penetrated everywhere. The art of composition, the art of symmetry, and the art of color were very popular for a while. During this period, two questions arose. I saw that painting had an inherent value independent of the faithful reproduction of things. I asked myself, should a person express what he knows or what he sees? Since painting has its own independent beauty, then a person has the possibility of creating an abstract beauty, as long as this beauty does not lose its painterly quality. For many years, the Cubists had no other purpose than the purpose of painting, painting for the sake of painting. They rejected those things that were not the main elements of painting art.</p>
<p>The mathematician Princet often discussed aesthetic problems with us. He had an ideal, wanting to create a geometry specifically for painters to use. This ideal is not new, because some official academies originally used Leonarpo da Vinci's geometry.</p>
<p>The use of color is not extensive, it only represents the elements of the structure in the volume. Everyone knows that a white surface is larger than a black surface of the same size. This theory is not only superficial, but also somewhat naive, but ordinary people spare no effort to insert many painting principles and laws into that superficial theory, and come to me to talk about their painting art.</p>
<p>In my eyes, a painting is by no means a goal, but an occasional pleasure, or an experience. In the field of modeling, color is the standard of measurement. We do not want to confine ourselves to scientific geometry, but there are many people in the world who spend their entire lives searching in this direction with no results, and art is deteriorating.</p>
<p>Cubist painters themselves cannot understand their own works, so they try to invent all kinds of mysterious theories to defend their own works. But Cubism is indeed a free art garden, without any arbitrary dogma. Paintings that are the same Cubist can express the concept of things, or they can express the appearance of things. They can coexist independently without hindering each other.</p>
<p>In fact, people never copy nature, nor do they imitate nature. People only add the clothes of practical form to imagined things. We never abandon painting in order to restore nature. On the contrary, we want to move from nature to painting. Many painters have turned the sun into a yellow dot, but at the same time, some painters, with the help of their art and ingenuity, have turned a yellow dot into a sun. Several elements drawn from nature can make a painting change. Only in this way can we approach the ideals of the great masters of the past who reproduced the natural appearance of things under the guidance of their own concepts.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that in the root of all painting, we can find a subjectively organized illusion, or a spiritual perception like that of Rimband (a modern French painter).</p>
<p>I do not consider the subject matter to be important, but I fully support the object. You must respect the object.</p>
<p>Do not confuse or reverse the key points or order of your most familiar thoughts.</p>
<p>We know that modern art is not the truth.</p>
<p>Art is a lie, this lie guides us closer to the truth, at least it can make us closer to the truths we can think of. A painter should think of ways to enlighten the masses, so that he sees that his lie is the truth.</p>
<p>I think the word "exploration" is really difficult to understand. I believe this word has no meaning. People will never learn from a person who bows his head when walking, hoping that the god of fate will drop a bag of money in front of him. A person who has no intention of exploring but discovers something occasionally will not be admired by the masses, but will be enough to attract their attention.</p>
<p>What I paint is not what I explore, but what I accidentally discover. Intention has no impact on the result. There is a Spanish saying that a person must prove the truth of his love with actions, not with words. The idea of exploring has led many of our painters into a state of emptiness, which can be said to be the biggest mistake of modern art. The spirit of exploring has poisoned many people. Because they do not have the positive aspects of modern art, they want to paint what the naked eye cannot see. What the naked eye cannot see cannot be expressed by art.</p>
<p>What a painting expresses after it is completed is often more than what the painter wants to express. The author is stunned and speculates about the results that were not expected at first.</p>
<p>We can often see that the creation of a painting is natural and unplanned.</p>
<p>People talk about naturalism to resist modern art, but who has ever seen a "natural" work?</p>
<p>Nature and art are two absolutely different phenomena.</p>
<p>Art gives us the possibility to express our concepts and wisdom, but nature has not given us this possibility. From the primitives - their art is far from nature - all the way down to David, Ingres, and Bouguerean, all the painters who reproduced nature deeply knew that art is always art and not nature. From the point of view of art, there is no such thing as an abstract image or a real image. What exists is only the patriarchal expression of the image.</p>
<p>Cubism, like all other schools of painting, is the same in quality and the same principles govern all different schools of painting. Cubism has never been understood, this fact has no important meaning in it, and it does not prove that the opinion of the masses is correct. I do not know German, and a German book is just black and white in my eyes, but I do not arbitrarily say that German does not exist.</p>
<p>Cubism is not a seed of new art, nor is it a sprout of new art, it only represents a period of development of existing painting forms. After these forms are realized, they have the right to exist independently.</p>
<p>If it is said that the current Cubism is still in its infancy, then a new form of Cubism will be produced in the future. Mathematics, geometry, psychopathology and other sciences have been used by people to explain Cubism, those explanations are just literature. Cubism pursues the purpose of modeling, and these purposes themselves can be satisfying. We can explain these purposes as a way to express everything that our intellect and eyes can see within the possible range allowed by images and colors. What an inexhaustible source of pleasure and discovery this is.</p>
<p>Henri Rousseau (Rousseau is a great modern French painter, his paintings are rich in originality) is not strange, but his mental power has developed to a complete degree. The first time I bought one of his oil paintings can be considered a chance encounter. One day I was wandering on Martyr Street and saw a toymaker arranging oil paintings on the wall outside his shop. A portrait caught my attention, the portrait was of a woman's face, with a cold and determined look, completely the look of a French woman. The oil painting was huge. I asked the price, and the merchant said, "Five francs, if you scrape off the things on the canvas, you can repaint a picture on it."</p>
<p>That painting is the most real psychological portrait in the French school.</p>
<p>People often use the term "evolution" and misuse it, which surprises me.</p>
<p>Art has no past and no future. Art that cannot occupy a place in the present will have no place in the future. The art of Greece and the art of Egypt do not belong to the past. They have more vitality today than they had yesterday. Change is not evolution. An artist who changes his expressive power has not changed his heart. Everyone has the right to change, and even painters have this power.</p>
<p>I will always create according to my own policy. I am impatient with the spirit of exploration. I express what I see with my own eyes.</p>
<p>I do not engage in contemplation, nor do I waste time on trying.</p>
<p>When I have something to express, I express it in the way and attitude that I think is most natural.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as transitional art in the world. There are only good and bad painters in the world. Inquisitive journalists and art lovers come to us and force us to tell them our artistic creeds and definitions. You are painters, do they want us to create definitions and maxims?</p>
<p>Yes, the collections of thoughts of Ingres (the giant of the French classical school) and Delaoroix (the master of the French romantic school) have been printed and published, but please ask which of Delaoroix's thoughts can be compared with his painting "Sardananapalusg"?</p>
<p>What is art? If I knew what art was, I would have to keep it a secret.</p>
<p>I don't explore, I just discover occasionally.</p>
