<p>國家之基本產業何物乎。兒童是已。商店以金錢爲基本產業。店主人及經理者。能愛護金錢。善於運用而不浪費。則商業自然發達。國家以兒童爲基本產業。撫有兒童者。能愛護兒童。善於敎育而皆成爲有用之材。則國家自然發達。蓋國家之根本在敎育。敎育之根本在兒童。世未有敎育不良而能成良國家者。亦未有敎育兒童不良。而能成良敎育者。故覘人國之强弱者。不必他求。祇覘其國之兒童。有敎育與無敎育而可已。</p>
<p>世界各國之兒童敎育。日有進步。所以鼓勵而維護之方法。谱日新而月異。美國向有兒童節。是日兒童得遊白宫。與總統握手笑談。總統則賜糖果以示親愛。惟其日由總統自擇。並不一定。今則胡佛總統已下令全國。定五月一日爲兒童日矣。此爲美國重視兒童之一事也。</p>
<p>歐洲各國。本有交換兒童遊學之舉。一以使兒童明瞭國情。一以增國際睦誼。今日本敎育會。爲兒童敎育計。擬以兒童介紹於各國。藉將國情向外貫輸。並增進兒童國際間知識與感情。業已决定特派少年全權。前赴歐美。此實爲訓練兒童之新辦法。亦即爲日本重視兒童之一證也。</p>
<p>各國之兒童敎育。蓬蓬勃勃。努力猛進如是。而返觀我。國之兒童。受敎育者幾何。失學者幾何。各國所視爲基本產業者。我國皆毁棄狼籍而不稍顧惜。其能與人爭一日之勝負耶。國家之經濟困乏非眞貧。兒童無敎育則眞貧。破產且將立至矣。</p>

<p>路透社十一日倫敦電英海軍大臣亞歷山大今日在攝匪爾演說、謂三强海軍協定、可使英國在九三六年以前節省六七千萬鎊、比較一九二七年日内瓦會議時所提議之數字、則目前協定使三國共减巡艦驅逐艦潛艇五十二萬一千噸、且使早日拆毁大戰艦九艘、計英國五艘、美國三艘、日本一艘、並限制三國最大巡艦之艦數、計美國十八艘、日本十五艘、日本十二艘、英國依此協定、可將其驅逐艦之噸數由十九萬噸、减爲十五萬噸、但若他國增造潛艇則驅逐艦噸數之减少、或將有變化耳、英美日三國根據協定、可按照他國不加入協定者之造艦程序而調節其地位云、</p>

<p>倫敦海軍會議</p>
<p>方法上之爭執與數　上之爭執</p>
<p>海軍會議之兩大暗礁</p>
<p>法意兩國衝突無法解决</p>
<p>地中海與太平洋未來影響</p>
<p>巴黎特訊、倫敦五大國海軍會議、開會已歷二月、初因討論限制方法、引起爭執、繼因法國内閣更迭停頓多時、今則會議前途、愈呈暗淡之象、列强意見衝突、幾已無轉圜餘地、雖向來最抱樂觀之人、亦不免垂頭喪氣、記者此信發表時、倫敦會議、是否有一種最後覺悟、而能挽回於萬一、未可知也、</p>
<p>倫敦會議之表面目的、乃以謀海軍軍備之裁减、裁减如不可能、則加以限制、然希望列强裁减軍備、實等於與虎謀皮、五强代表口頭所樂道之（和平誠意、）一充其量亦不過希望於五六年之短期内、暫時停止大規模之海軍擴張、藉以補救各國財政危機於一時、換言之、即欲以比較低廉之代價、準備未來大戰而已、但僅此粉飾太平苟且一時之舉、亦不易求得列强之一致、於此次會議中、可以見之、</p>
<p>海軍限制問題之爭爭執要點、果何在乎、此可就兩方面來說、第一爲方法上之爭執、第二爲數量上之爭執、</p>
<p>吾人皆知海軍艦隊之構成、極爲複雜、戰船之等級、有主力艦（即鐵甲戰艦、）飛機運送艦、大巡洋艦、小巡洋艦、驅逐艦、潛水艦、魚雷艇、掃水雷艇、及其他零星之船隻等、華盛頓會議所已限制者、僅主力艦與飛機運送艦、其他各級補助艦之限制、均有待於此次會議之解决、補助艦之限制、又有種種不同之方法第一、補助艦總噸數之限制、第二、每級戰船總噸數之限制、第三、每級戰船艘數之限制、第四、每級戰船中每艘之最大噸數、及砲徑之限制、第五、戰艦使用年齡之最少限制、（即每一戰艦造成後、至少須經若干年方能換造新艦）由此可見海軍軍備之限制方法、甚爲複雜、大抵各國均然望對於自國所特别需要之戰艦、輕减限制、别國所特别需要之戰艦、則嚴格限制、例如英美兩國因主力艦及巡洋艦、均佔優勢、故主張廢除或裁减潛水艇、反之法日、因缺少巡洋艦、故反對裁减潛水艇、就限制之方法、英國之提案、主張各級總噸數及每級戰艦之噸數、均分别限制、法國提案、則相反、主張僅限制補助艦之全體噸數、每級之噸數、則可由各國自由支配、此種方法上之爭執、於會議初開時、成爲一時難關、其後乃採用法國所提出之妥協案、即一方面限制總噸數、一方面規定各級戰船噸數之最大限制及最小限制、如是則於分級限制之中、仍予各國以自由伸縮之餘地、因此限制之方法、大體已無爭執、惟就細則上、則各國爭點仍甚多、技術委員會、雖討論至數星期之久、於各級分類之詳細方法、仍未完全决定也、</p>
<p>但方法上之爭執、雖勉强獲得一致、而一提及限制之數量、則圖窮而七首見矣、各國開列數字、多絕對衝突、雖欲力求妥協、亦不可得、原來華盛頓會議規定五强之主力艦噸數比例、爲英五、美五、日三、法一·七五、意一·七五、此次倫敦會議中、英國委曲求全、對美竭力讓步、對於補助艦維持英美均等之原則、故在表面上、英美間尚無重大衝突、但日法意三國、則均不願以華盛頓會議之比例、施之於補助艦之限制、日本要求巡洋艦之噸數、佔美國百分之七十、即由華會所定美日兩國五對三之比例、增至五對三五之比例、就此點美國不允讓步、其次法國、則尤爲强硬、法國以世界第二殖民帝國爲理由要求有充分之海軍力、以保護其大西洋與地中海兩海岸之防線、及法本國與殖民地間之聯絡、就法國所提出之要求、法國將成爲英美以外世界最大海軍國、此則英意報紙攻擊之所由來也、復次則意大利、要求其海軍力與大陸最大海軍國之軍力相等、即與法國之海軍力相等、蓋華會對於主力艦、旣與法意兩國以同等之比例、則對於補助艦、意國自亦有理由以作同樣之要求、</p>
<p>由此可見美日之數量爭執、法意之數量爭執、爲倫敦會議之兩大暗礁、會議一觸及此暗礁、立時有破裂之危險、美國已對日本之提案、提出對案、願對驅逐艦及潛水艇、與日本以相當之優勢、同時要求日本不堅持百分之七十之比例、但至今已歷二星期、日本尚未有答覆、傳聞日本海軍大臣以辭職相要挾、反對接受美國之對案、可見日美之衝突、目前能否圓滿解决、尚未可知也、至法意之爭執、近日似益緊張、法意兩國報紙、互相排斥甚烈、在事實上、就意國財政能力、實不能與法國從事軍備競爭、然慕沙里尼爲維持其國家權威起見、堅不讓步、必爭得法意同等而後已、英相麥唐納、雖竭力作調人、亦仍無轉圜餘地、至在法國方面、表示對於海軍造艦可以讓步、但必須與英美等國、合訂地中海保安公約、遇法國在地中海沿岸受侵略時、英美海軍、應與以援助英美不願參加大陸各國間之糾紛、先後加以拒絕、因此法意之爭執、遂成爲會議中之最大難關、至今仍無解决之希望、法意兩國旣因數量引起爭執、遂有人以爲可以屏除法意、締結英美日三國間之海軍協定、以事實論、似亦不易辦到者、蓋海軍問題、五大國實互相牽連而不可分離、英國一方面、宣稱英美海軍均等、甘心放棄其百餘年來一手獨攬之海上覇權、但在他方面、仍不願放棄其在歐洲方面丨北海及地中海丨之絕對優勢、英國之海軍計畫、在使其海軍力與歐洲大陸兩大海軍國丨法意丨之合併軍力相等、因此法意兩國間之限制數量未决定、則英國之海軍限制、亦不能决定、英國不能决定、則要求與英國同等之美國、亦不能决定其海軍限制、同時視英美爲進退之日本海軍限制、亦更無由决定、一部牽動全局、此倫敦會議之所以束手無策也海軍會議之失敗、在現在幾成爲已定之事實、即使會議至最後、能產出若干之結果、亦不過爲保全各國政府之面子、未必能有重要之决議、然此次會議之本身、雖不足重視、而其失敗後之影響、則大足引起吾人之注意、蓋各强國之利害衝突、向來賴外交家之和平辭令、隠而不宣、此次會議如果宛全失敗、則内容必將洩露、列强軍備擴張、將加速度進行、武弉和平、必有一日衝破之虞、就此次會議所顯示之事實以觀、則此後地中海太平洋之風　、更見險惡、地中海方面、法意兩拉丁姊妹國之互爭歐陸覇權、由來已久、最近法意報紙、評論海軍事件、互出惡言、各不相遜、同時德國右黨及已爾幹半島諸國之法西斯黨、活動甚烈、在此嚴重之局勢下、而謂國際聯盟開洛公約之能保障歐洲和平、其誰信之、太平洋方面、日美之競爭、勢亦無可倖免、蓋近來各資本主義國之工商業繁榮、已漸超越頂點、工業品之銷塲、資本之輸出、各國無不感到困難、美日兩大新興工業國爲尤甚爲爭奪東方之商業利益、固可從利用政治外交金融各種方法、以互爭雄長、但此種方法用盡以後、則不能不訴之於最後之武力、吾人愼勿以遠在數萬里外少許外交家軍事家之談判、爲無關吾人之痛癢也、（三月二十二日化魯自巴黎寄）</p>

<p>水脚損失十分之八上海至漢口、現有中英日六家輪公司、此六公司中、華商占三家、雖有二十船、但在此一年中、行駛者不足三分之一、而英日輪之常行往來者、有二十六輪、故平均每一星期、外輪可開十八或十九班、華輪祗三四次、漢口一埠、裝貨來滬之水脚、茲因華商查明、計有四百萬兩一年、計上年統年營業、中國輪公司、祇收得百分之二十五、而百分之七十五、（即三百萬兩）之下水運費、乃爲太古怡和日清三家外輪所得、</p>
<p>棉花盡被洋商攬運漢口運滬貨之最大者爲棉花、蓋豫陜湘鄂各省、年可產九百萬担、除運他埠得外、其純粹裝到上海者、有一百六十萬包、刻下漢口紗廠、有第一·震環·裕華·申新·楚安等六家、而棉行有三十餘家、多係咸寗帮人所辦、每年打包裝滬者、有三廠、長江船下水貨、以此爲大宗、華輪上年停班以後、英日商輪爭運棉花甚激、去歲太古公司之運棉額、由十五萬包驟增至四十萬包、日清公司亦由二十三萬包增至四十萬包、怡和增至三十萬包祥泰輪亦裝得不少、而我華輪、僅得一尾數耳、</p>
<p>裝卸工人來滬求援重慶領江工潮發生後、英日外輪置之不理、將上游船陸續調滬、行駛滬宜綫、對於加薪案决不接受、而宜昌之裝卸工會、自四一要求增工罷業後、在上游之各外輪、亦如對付領江者、以對付裝卸工人、惟各工人須做一日活一日、一旦停業、有妨生計、洋商更堅决無通融之餘地、昨得確訊、宜昌裝卸工會、爲求保障生計、免受外商壓逼起見、已决定推舉代表、由宜來滬、向上海總工會要求援助、並至滬後、與各輪公司協議加工辦法矣、</p>

<p>— 杜少梅</p>
<p>海上春三。士女多喜作龍華游。以桃華灼灼而春光明媚也。本月五日。家君舊部材官房某。適自龍華來。云路上天桃已盛。余欣然携弱小妹小梅幼梅同往。並邀王夫子梅璩。夫子以他事。不能同行。甚爲悵悵。乃於二時命車出。房願鄉導。由西摩路至謹記橋。約一刻鐘。而橋邊游人已漸多矣。</p>
<p>道中之風景距謹記橋半里曰計家灣。房之宅也。房謂不如在此停車。不然無異花間喝道矣。余然之。遂停車。房又恐余等不良于行。蓋余年十六。小梅十一。幼梅僅七齡也。至其家。出茶以餉。須臾步出計家灣。爲龍華大路。沿途坟童放紙鳶。而老幼挑青。黄髮垂髫。並怡然自樂。桃源勝地。不圖於蜃市得之。</p>
<p>塔上之偉觀龍華有塔。在講經寺側。寺不大。香火甚盛。游人如織。寺僧一年之計。皆在此時。幼梅欲登塔。拾級而上。高七層。階甚狹。上易而下難。凭欄遥矚。房曰。塔之東爲浦東。南爲水泥廠等處。西則新龍華。北則上海市也。小梅曰。是何異超然臺耶。下搭時。客有孺子哭者。以梯無欄。恐一落千丈也。</p>
<p>魏家花園之花木游旣倦。欲歸。房曰。此處有魏家花園者。風景甚佳。乃由小橋而入羊腸曲徑。至該園。園大七十畝。環以小溪。花草甚茂。松樹尤多。仰天兀地者。其種不一。園有墳數壟。松舖其上。勢尤奇。又有丹楓數十株。高如岑樓。誠不可多得也。</p>
<p>鄉父老之欲望園中芍藥甚多。余等入園時。有鄉人年五十外。貿然引導。效毛遂之自薦。及見芍藥。指爲香椿頭。又有洋水仙。房因謔曰。此莫非大葱乎。聞者軒渠。而鄉人呶呶。意别有在。如杭人所謂刨黄瓜。滬所謂敲竹槓也。余贈以銀角四枚。稱謝去。可憐亦可笑已。</p>
<p>夕陽中之歸詠少焉。日在西山。將歸休。步至計家灣。登車過謹記橋。游人更多。與古昔高梁橋景象略同。因紀以七律一首。詩曰。（小註鋒車謹記橋。紙鳶飛舞酒帘飄。爐香燃盡金千炷。塔影高騫玉一條。柳色青青春色透。桃華灼灼日華嬌。無言穠艶皆含笑。似送游人歸路遥。）小梅亦有詩曰。（碧柳依依弱縷垂。桃腮爛漫逞芳姿。浮圖七級干霄上。默與龍華訂後期。）</p>

<p>藝苑名家王濟遠氏。自民十五辭上海美專敎職後。埋頭研究。兼事游歷。曾東游四次。並涉足國内名勝。搜羅畫材。藝益猛晉。舉凡油繪。紛繪。水墨。水粉各畫之人體。風景。靜物。無不精微而雄厚。吾人在全國美展及藝苑第一届美展已見之矣。</p>
<p>今度王氏將自費出國赴歐。將其一年來之近作。於本月十一日至十四日。在西藏路寧波同鄉會舉行歐游誌别紀念展。余於開幕之前一日驅車先覩。大足驚人。蓋王氏之作風。逈異疇昔。組細兼備。其豪邁處如萬馬之奔騰。其動人處如杜鵑之夜啼。令人留戀會場。不忍遽去。足見藝術感人之深。歸而紀之。</p>
<p>去年四月十日。爲全國美展開幕之期。今年四月十日。爲王氏個展公開之日。雖值雷電交作。時雨傾盆。而觀衆仍冐雨而往。余最喜其水彩速寫。及新賴的國畫。多半爲其友人如畫家陳抱一、潘玉良·陳澄波·金啓靜·柳演仁·汪荻浪·鄧芬·張辰伯。中委李石曾·浙敎陳布雷·鄭萼邨·名流葉譽虎等。皆已標定王氏之作品聞會中辦事人云。事前曾發售預約券。以故爭先購定。實亦倡導新藝術之好現象也。</p>
<p>油繪巨製。如（悔）（假面具）（重見光明）諸幅。尤含深意。（悔）是寫一披綢袍之裸女。裏其額。掉首向上返顧。肌肉緊張。具有難言之隠。實爲塲中最大之作。亦最動人。（假面具）一幅。是描寫人類之貪性。好虚榮。爲物質所役。綠色面套蒙其眼。手纏金飾。與背影二男子。互相交接。實爲黑暗社會之縮影。諒爲作者有感而發。（重見光明）一幅。似爲聯續（假面具）之作。繪一裸婦。側坐窗前。俯首悔悟。滿地抛棄面具。重見大地光明。背襯青紫色。含着無限希望。亦可見畫家用心之苦矣。</p>
<p>餘如小品。在蘇杭。之寫生。更見精采。聞王氏在短旅中。每日朝暮能作畫二十幅。可謂神乎其技。值此個展期内。一般愛好美術者。幸勿交臂失之。</p>

<p>— 朱兆莘</p>
<p>履南洋之所見。熙來攘往者什七八皆華人。苟不問統治　之誰屬。未有不誤認爲故鄉者也。僑暹華人。較他處尤衆。蓋暹地廣人稀。欲招移民實之。美吾華種。故獨喜華人之至。安其居。樂其俗。優游生息。華族之在暹。於是乎滋大矣。爲農多。爲工多。爲商何莫非至多。而商業團體之偉大。亦莫與京焉。去年夏。余辭官南遊。至暹京。見新建中華總商會。輪焉奐焉。黄會長慶修。伸紙　管。請唋書額。臨别贈言。更題母忘祖國四字勗之。余歸國半載。黄會長函告落成典禮。將發特刋爲紀念。請余作序。余聞禮之成。至隆重。暹王暹后與當地聞人各國駐使皆蒞止。餘事之盛可想。華商地位之隆亦可喻。然此皆不必詞費。余所欲言者。國籍條約兩端而己。國籍。最易得。亦最難得者也。以土著之人。有所出。若盧仝生子名添丁。取爲國添一丁役義。此取得國籍。自然之結果也。有父母非其國人。而子女生斯土者。亦得編籍爲氓。此屬地主義之結果也。有雖生在國外。從血統而歸化。仍取得父母之國籍者。此屬人主義之結果也。有居住其地。多歷年所。得依本人之請求。而取得旅居地之國籍者。此從其意志之結果也。若夫旣非出生其地。又非隨血統以歸化。更非居住如干年而上。經法定程序之許可。而自然取得國籍得。此誠世界所罕聞。有之。惟暹之待華人耳。華人一入暹境。暹即以籍民視焉。在彼固自有因。在我則得失之數。或成疑問。以爲失耶。則如華人之往美也。入境己難。遑論入籍。蓋黄種人除土生外。不得享籍民權利也。乃籍暹之易。如拾草芥。以彼例此。安可不順受之乎。以爲得耶。則多一籍暹之人。即失一華籍之氓矣。惟吾國國籍法。對於國民之他往者。及其子女之生長他方者。未經正式脫籍。則隨時來歸。仍是中國之民也。日本人民出外謀生。其政府爲之保護。且有爲營業便利起見。助其取得他國國籍者。誠以一國生齒太繁。不可無安插之尾　。國籍出入。其得失不能一槪論也。是故。吾民入暹籍。暫聽之可也。歸來則華籍矣。惟中暹條約未成。我國無駐暹便領。僑民不得相當保護。斯可憾耳。論地理。則暹與我同洲。論歷史。則暹爲我舊藩。論種族。則華人在暹莩乳。同冶一爐。論商務。則全暹貿易。華僑莫不與焉。中暹之間。如是其密切也。何可一日無約。暹與同洲之日本有約。與同洲之白種殖民地有約。而與同洲最大之獨立國反無約。果何爲哉。中暹訂約。迄無成謠。同彼以我國内頻年多故爲口實。豈知我正與各國爲改訂平等條約之進行。而彼反故作推延也。揣其意。非輕中國。剔懼中國耳。由前之說。堂堂大邦。詎能容許。由後之說。華族和平。奚庸過慮。吾信訂約以後。中暹親善有加。面華僑在暹所發生難題。亦迎刄而解。此正兩國政府。所同祈嚮者也。國之於民。猶父母之於兒女。陟　而知其子思親之切。倚　而知其親念子之殷。國之不遣其民。與民之不忘其國。無異致也。凡寄身愈遠者。其向心力愈强。僑民愛國之誠。可騐矣。旅暹華商建會所。稱中華。不忘本也。一舉而敬業樂羣愛國之心畢露。處無約保護之境。尤微自治精神能力爲不可及。吁。可敬也己。中華民國十九年春。花縣朱兆莘序。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十回赤燄騰天勾欄欽孝女　紅毹貼地即席晤名伶</p>
<p>蕊雲等回到家裏。大阿姨說道。阿呀。你們到那裏去看戲的呀。有幾張的票。寫出要你親自去的。我敎相帮來轉局。他們都說没有尋處。什麽謀得利賣脫俚。在那種隠僻的地方。開了什麽戲館。我們住在上海。也有比十年了。只聽得丹桂、天仙、等茶園。並没有那種戲館呢。一個相帮。在大馬路兜了好幾個圈子。也没有尋着。我正在駡他們那班飯桶。爲什麽剛纔阿囡去時。你們不跟一個人去。他們都是貪懶罷了。左詩晨聽了暗暗好笑。想幸虧我們去的時候。不曾呌蕊雲坐了包車去。不然。他們轉堂唱。也會轉到謀得利來。可是即使我得着地方。看門的巡捕。也不讓他們進來。現在事已過去。不必說穿了。蕊雲那天很是高興。居然得有一天。舒舒服服的從頭上看到末尾的全齣戲看完。中間不曾打了一個扯。十分得意。這時房間裏幾個小姊妹。都要敎伊把看過的戲。一一講給他們聽。蕊雲擺出架子來道。這種戲不是老戲館裏敲着鑼鼓的那種戲。也不是現在那種流行的文明戲。是一班留學東洋的留學生。他們高興起來自己編成的那種戲。要他們高興纔做。他們不高興。出他們幾萬塊錢。他們也不高興做咧。鳳雲道。這也不過是一種新戲罷了。那及老戲。老戲是有唱的。要是我就喜歡聽唱。有幾個老生。唱得眞好。那時鳳雲便（我本是。臥龍岡）的哼起來。含雲正要聽戲中情節。說你不要吵嘘。曉得你會唱兩句。你要高興。明天你到了檯面上。多唱幾隻就是了。爲什麽搁胡琴先生。又說你唱得不入調呢。蕊雲這時便告訴他們這一齣戲的名兒。喚做不如歸。是一齣苦戲。到了後來的幾幕。二少說我要出眼涙了。我說我向來不會出眼滬的。有許多人看看小說書。看到了苦的地方。便出眼捩了。我是不會的。但到了後來。做到苦的地方。我眞的也出眼涙了。一戲院子的人。凡是妇人。没有一個不出眼涙的。含雲道。旣然要出眼涙。那就不要看下去了。蕊雲道。二少也這樣說。我們回去吧。但是他越做得苦。我們越要看。好像是越苦越有滋味。這也不獨是我們。合戲院子的人。也没有一個肯走的。正說到那裏。只聽樓下人聲喧雜。左詩晨同蕊雲道。什麽事。樓下許多人聲嘈雜。</p>

<p>Chen Gongbo Expresses Willingness to Compromise</p>
<p>Zou Xie and Others to Go to Taiyuan to Persuade</p>
<p>(Peiping) Wang telegraphed to the Peiping Party Liaison, saying, "I deeply admire all comrades for fighting for the Party. I believe it is appropriate to sacrifice prejudices and not let the selfishness of one or two individuals affect the future of the Party. It must be known that the pain of the Party's demise is greater than the loss of personal position. I only seek what is beneficial to the Party; everything can be discussed. As for fabricated accusations, they are not worth considering." 11th Dispatch</p>
<p>(Peiping) Wang telegraphed to Peiping, "The opinions of the Party and government published in newspapers in the North, South, and abroad vary considerably. I am not responsible for anything that has not been signed by me from now on." 12th Dispatch</p>
<p>(Peiping) Official sources say that Chen Gongbo has compromised and abandoned the "sacrificing the Party Constitution" argument, agreeing to the "facts" argument. He requested that a military government be formed first and intends to have Wu Chaoshu be responsible for foreign affairs. 12th Dispatch</p>
<p>(Peiping) Today, Guan Xuding, who was arrested for tearing up slogans, confessed that he was ordered by Committee Member Li of the joint office of the district branch. He was then sent to the Public Security Bureau for strict handling. 12th Dispatch</p>
<p>(Peiping) The joint office of the Party departments of various provinces and regions issued a statement saying that since some people have recently advocated replacing Party authority with civil rights and reorganizing the Party, they have decided to declare that the Party cannot be reorganized until there is true civil rights. 12th Dispatch</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Peiping-Tianjin Executive Department of the Party... Party... Party, originally on Chang'an Street, has now moved to Xin Temple Hutong. (12th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zou Lu and Xie Chi of the Western Hills Conference faction left here tonight for Taiyuan, where they will meet with Yan Xishan and Chen Gongbo to discuss Party affairs. This long-unresolved issue is expected to be resolved satisfactorily soon due to concessions from the Shanxi side. (12th City Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Peiping's telegram on the 12th said: (1) Chen Gongbo and others were extremely indignant after returning to Peiping. They immediately telegraphed Wang Jingwei, reporting the situation of the meeting in Taiyuan and all their proposals, none of which were adopted by Yan Xishan, and that Yan still wanted to taste the presidency. According to a certain gentleman close to Chen Gongbo, he has received a reply from Wang Jingwei, stating that Wang is determined not to come north. Therefore, forming a government in Peiping will be difficult to achieve. (2) The reorganization faction in Peiping and Tianjin deeply believes that Yan Xishan does not recognize the Party's principles, does not understand the ideology, is completely a feudal warlord in mind, and is not a true revolutionary. Therefore, an atmosphere of opposing Yan and allying with Feng is prevalent in Peiping and Tianjin. 12th Dispatch</p>

<h3 id="e11">Yesterday's Party Purification Commemoration <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Today is the third anniversary of the Kuomintang's Party purification. The Central Party Headquarters held a commemorative meeting at 2:00 PM on this day. Central Committee members Wang Chonghui, Chen Guofu, Liu Luyin, Shao Yuanchong, Jiao Yitang, Yu Jingtang, Li Wenfan, and approximately 400 staff members and guests attended. Wang Chonghui presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, Liu Luyin gave a report, stating that today is the anniversary of saving the Party from the encirclement of northern warlords and communists three years ago. We know that the old imperialism uses the stubbornness of our country's warlords to resist the new trend, and the new imperialism deceives the young people of our country and deceives the national masses to resist the old imperialism. At that time, the Party was under this kind of pressure, which was very dangerous. Therefore, we had to use the method of Party purification to reorganize it, and then we saved the Party. However, although Party purification has been going on for three years now, the northern warlords and southern deceptive elements still exist, and even collude with each other to plot a resurgence. The deceptive elements have completely exposed their original false revolutionary faces. In this way, the Party's spirit of constantly striving for the national revolution can be better proven. Now that the reactionary elements have not been completely eliminated, the Party should continue the work of Party purification. All comrades should unite and pay attention to the behavior of reactionary elements at any time, so as to avoid being buried inside the Party and seeking a resurgence from the ashes. In this time of widespread rumors, we must remain calm with an indomitable spirit. Those who disturb each other are helping the rebels and helping the Soviet Russian imperialism. Their crimes are even worse than the rebels. Chen Guofu and Shao Yuanchong then delivered speeches and the meeting adjourned. 12th Dispatch</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain source, regarding the China-Japan legal rights issue, the Japanese government has fully accepted it in principle after our country submitted a draft. What remains to be considered is the detailed method after the abolition of consular jurisdiction. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is paying great attention to this. Recently, it has not only observed the attitudes of various countries for reference, but also instructed Shigemitsu to investigate from our country in many ways. During Shigemitsu's visit to Nanjing, he had informal contacts with Wang Chonghui, Wang Zhengting, and important Party and government figures, and indeed deliberated on the follow-up methods of legal rights. However, the Japanese parliament will soon convene a meeting for three weeks. During this period, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs may not have time to study the legal rights counter-proposal.

<h3 id="e22">America's Children's Day and Japan's Youth Ambassador <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>What is the basic industry of a nation? It is its children. A store's basic industry is money. If the store owner and manager can love money, use it well, and not waste it, then the business will naturally thrive. A nation's basic industry is its children. If those who nurture children can love children, educate them well, and all become useful talents, then the nation will naturally thrive. The foundation of a nation lies in education, and the foundation of education lies in children. There has never been a good nation that has been built on poor education, nor has there ever been good education that has been built on poorly educated children. Therefore, to observe the strength or weakness of a nation, there is no need to look elsewhere; simply observe whether its children are educated or uneducated.</p>
<p>The education of children in all countries of the world is progressing day by day. The methods of encouraging and maintaining it are constantly being renewed. The United States has always had Children's Day. On this day, children can visit the White House, shake hands and chat with the President, and the President gives candy to show his love. However, the day is chosen by the President himself and is not fixed. Now, President Hoover has ordered the entire country to designate May 1st as Children's Day. This is one of the ways that the United States attaches importance to children.</p>
<p>European countries have already exchanged children for study tours. One is to enable children to understand national conditions, and the other is to increase international friendship. Now, the Japan Education Association, for the sake of children's education, plans to introduce children to various countries, so as to convey national conditions to the outside world and enhance children's international knowledge and feelings. It has already decided to send a special youth ambassador to Europe and the United States. This is indeed a new way to train children and is also a proof that Japan attaches importance to children.</p>
<p>The education of children in various countries is booming and making rapid progress. When we look back at the children in our country, how many are educated and how many are out of school? The industry that other countries regard as fundamental is being destroyed and abandoned in our country without any regard. How can we compete with others for a day's victory? A nation's economic poverty is not true poverty; the lack of education for children is true poverty. Bankruptcy is imminent.</p>

<p>A General Meeting to be Held Tomorrow Afternoon</p>
<p>A Five-Power Agreement is Being Drafted</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th - The plenary session of the Naval Conference is scheduled to be held on Monday, only to receive the report of the First Committee. If the work of the Drafting Committee is completed early, the plenary session for signing the agreement will be held on Thursday.</p>
<p>Japanese League, London, 11th - Wakatuki, the plenipotentiary, said regarding the drafting of the treaty, "This treaty is divided into three parts. The first two parts are effective for the five countries, and the third part is effective for the three countries: Britain, Japan, and the United States. The atmosphere among the five plenipotentiaries is quite good now. The general meeting is scheduled to be held on the 17th to sign the five-power agreement." The Organizing Committee has decided to rush the drafting of the treaty.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th - The British Naval Minister Alexander said in a speech in Sheffield today that the Three-Power Naval Agreement could save Britain 60 to 70 million pounds before 1936. Compared with the figures proposed at the Geneva Conference in 1927, the current agreement reduces the total tonnage of cruisers, destroyers, and submarines of the three countries by 521,000 tons, and will lead to the early demolition of nine battleships: five British, three American, and one Japanese, and limits the number of the largest cruisers of the three countries, namely 18 for the United States, 15 for Japan, and 12 for Britain. According to this agreement, Britain can reduce its destroyer tonnage from 190,000 tons to 150,000 tons, but if other countries increase the construction of submarines, the reduction in destroyer tonnage may change. The United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan can adjust their positions according to the shipbuilding program of countries that do not join the agreement.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th - Except for the Morning Post, which lamented that the Naval Conference failed to establish a five-power agreement and worried that the three-power agreement would cause disturbances, all the newspapers this morning expressed their satisfaction, believing that the Naval Conference had achieved a partial success. The Times stated that the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan have expanded the work of the Washington Conference and completed it, abolishing the competition for naval armaments. In addition to saving expenses, this conference can eliminate the sources of mutual suspicion, misunderstanding, and conflict, and pave the way for future disarmament. The gap between the three-power agreement and the five-power agreement is not as large as before. The Daily Express stated that the politicians involved should not be satisfied with this success, as the world expects more than this. Other newspapers praised the British Prime Minister's efforts in the Naval Conference.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 12th - Newspapers mostly praised the achievements of British Prime Minister MacDonald at the Naval Conference, but the New York World stated that the terms of the three-power agreement may cause countries to compete in shipbuilding in groups and may be seen as a disguised alliance of the three naval powers, putting the United States in the whirlpool of European intrigue.</p>

<h3 id="e61">The Nature of the Indian Salt Tax <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The Tax Rate is 24 Times Greater Than the Selling Price</p>
<p>An Invisible Slaughter of Indian Civilians</p>
<p>Translated and abridged from the India Report by the World Society: Among Gandhi's anti-British movements, destroying the salt tax is one of its key items, which is also the first round of the battle between Gandhi and the British Governor. However, the nature of this salt tax is rarely known to the world. According to the British side, India's exports are ten times greater than its imports, so most of the imported ships are empty. Empty ships cannot sail on the sea and must have ballast, and salt is the best ballast. Therefore, a large amount of Liverpool salt is loaded into India. This statement is debatable, but India originally produces a large amount of salt, enough for people to eat. Why is it necessary to load this ship salt and dump it into India, facilitating British shipping and making the Indian economy exhausted? According to the salt affairs records published by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce, this bundle of Liverpool salt dumped in India is directly killing Indian salt producers and enabling the government to extract surprisingly heavy taxes from the poorest people. Salt is the only seasoning for Indian civilians. They are almost always on the verge of starvation in their lives. What they eat every day is only salt and rice. The government's heavy taxation is shocking. The wholesale price of salt is ten pies (currency name, about two cents in gold) per maund (unit of measurement, equivalent to 82 pounds), while the tax is 20 annas, or 240 pies, which is 24 times the price of salt. What does this mean for the Indian poor? It is difficult for the world to imagine. In order to maintain this inhumane monopoly, the British have taken the salt production business into the hands of the government. Is this moral, just, or fair? Or, is Gandhi's move to destroy a recognized source of tax revenue, that is, to break the law? Alas, is not the prostitution industry protected by the state also a recognized source of tax revenue? Why is it that all men and women with noble thoughts are willing to abolish it? Moreover, Gandhi has repeatedly advised the authorities with reason, but the authorities did not listen, so he used this means of destruction, which was really unavoidable.</p>

<p>Strikes Implemented in Japanese Textile Mills</p>
<p>The Proletarian Alliance Established</p>
<p>Telegram from the Telegraphic Communication Society, Osaka, 12th - The Kanebo Takasago textile factory began a strike today after the request to withdraw the pay cut proposal was rejected.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Telegraphic Communication Society, Tokyo, 12th - The Kanebo Yodogawa factory officially announced a temporary shutdown yesterday due to the deterioration of the dispute. The Kanebo factories in Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe have all caused the problem of illegal detention by the company authorities, which has become more unstable. The workers have decided to fight the company under the support of the Joint Struggle Committee for a protracted war. Representatives of the Hyogo factory and employee representatives are scheduled to meet with President Wakao today, but since the company's attitude has been made clear, it has been decided to obtain the support of some labor unions and go on strike resolutely. Six hundred male and female workers in the factory have spent the night in the factory staff canteen.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Telegraphic Communication Society, Tokyo, 11th - The implementation of the Kanebo pay cut finally prompted the rise of various proletarian factions, forming a national struggle alliance. The Social Masses Party has declared its formal participation in the alliance, and various groups supporting the proletariat will mobilize to create an unprecedented momentum. The joint agreement conference of the Japanese Masses Party, the Social Masses Party, and various labor support groups held a meeting yesterday, and as a result, decided to cooperate with the Joint Struggle Committee to start an opposition movement. On the one hand, the Social Masses Party and the labor group agreement meeting supporting the party decided to propose outdoor rally demonstrations and nationwide fundraising for dispute funds, and issued a statement saying that it would resolutely wage a decisive struggle for survival against the oppression of brutal capitalists. At the same time, Katsuma Akamatsu and Komakichi Matsuoka were appointed as members of the Struggle Alliance. In addition, the Japanese Masses Party specially established a countermeasures committee and telegraphed proletarian groups in the location of the Kanebo factory, stating that they would cooperate with other labor groups and stand on a common front. At the same time, Kanebo was cutting pay before the Labor Union Law was promulgated, and it requested the Ministry of Internal Affairs to quickly formulate the Labor Union Law.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Telegraphic Communication Society, Tokyo, 12th - Due to the rising tide of opinions from various factories and the world, the company showed a willingness to compromise. The Hyogo Prefectural Police Authority visited President Nagao yesterday to inquire about the company's intentions, intending to come out and mediate. In addition, Legislator Nishio also traveled around to investigate the company's intentions and the workers' actual situation, and returned to Osaka this morning, saying that the company has a somewhat yielding attitude and that there is a dawn of resolution.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 12th - This morning, major newspaper companies commented on the cotton mill strike caused by the 30% pay cut at Kanebo, and unanimously attached importance to this matter, saying that the weakness of the current social situation in the country can be seen from this. Although the newspapers said that mutual concessions are necessary, they expressed sympathy to the workers.</p>

<p>National Society, Paris, 12th - The French Thédore Cabinet suffered another defeat in the parliament today. Republican Socialist Party members moved to restore the Special Committee for Reviewing Government Contracts, which was abolished in 1928. Thédore came out to oppose it, saying that the contracts signed by the government are already the responsibility of the cabinet members, and the parliament has also been able to control them, so there is already sufficient guarantee. He also said that he did not want to treat it as a matter of confidence, but asked the members to make a judgment based on common sense and deny the motion. However, as a result of the vote, it was passed by 308 votes to 260. However, because it was stated that it did not involve a matter of confidence, it did not affect the cabinet.</p>

<p>London Naval Conference</p>
<p>Disputes on Methods and Disputes on Numbers</p>
<p>Two Major Reefs of the Naval Conference</p>
<p>Franco-Italian Conflict Unresolved</p>
<p>Future Impact on the Mediterranean and Pacific</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Paris: The London Five-Power Naval Conference, having been in session for two months, initially sparked disputes over the methods of limitation, followed by a lengthy hiatus due to the change of the French cabinet. Now, the prospects of the conference are becoming increasingly bleak. The conflicts in opinions among the powers have left little room for compromise. Even those who were most optimistic cannot help but feel dejected. At the time of this dispatch, it is unknown whether the London Conference will have a final moment of enlightenment and be able to salvage the situation in the slightest.</p>
<p>The ostensible purpose of the London Conference is to seek reductions in naval armaments, or, if reductions are impossible, to impose limitations. However, hoping that the powers will reduce their armaments is tantamount to seeking skin from a tiger. The "sincere desire for peace" that the representatives of the five powers so readily profess is, at best, nothing more than a desire to temporarily halt large-scale naval expansion for a short period of five or six years, in order to alleviate the financial crises of various countries for a time. In other words, it is an attempt to prepare for a future war at a relatively low cost. However, even this superficial attempt to maintain peace and muddle through for the time being is not easy to achieve unanimous agreement among the powers, as can be seen in this conference.</p>
<p>What are the key points of contention in the naval limitation issue? This can be discussed from two perspectives: first, disputes on methods; second, disputes on numbers.</p>
<p>As we all know, the composition of a naval fleet is extremely complex. The classes of warships include battleships (i.e., ironclad warships), aircraft carriers, heavy cruisers, light cruisers, destroyers, submarines, torpedo boats, minesweepers, and other miscellaneous vessels. The Washington Conference only limited battleships and aircraft carriers. The limitation of other classes of auxiliary vessels remains to be resolved at this conference. The limitation of auxiliary vessels also involves various different methods: first, limitation of the total tonnage of auxiliary vessels; second, limitation of the total tonnage of each class of warship; third, limitation of the number of warships in each class; fourth, limitation of the maximum tonnage and gun caliber of each ship in each class; fifth, minimum age limit for warships (i.e., each warship must be in service for at least a certain number of years before a new ship can be built to replace it). From this, it can be seen that the methods of limiting naval armaments are very complex. Generally, each country hopes to reduce the limitations on warships that it particularly needs, and to strictly limit warships that other countries particularly need. For example, since Great Britain and the United States have an advantage in battleships and cruisers, they advocate abolishing or reducing submarines. Conversely, France and Japan, lacking cruisers, oppose reducing submarines. Regarding the methods of limitation, the British proposal advocates limiting the total tonnage of each class and the tonnage of each warship in each class separately. The French proposal, on the other hand, advocates only limiting the overall tonnage of auxiliary vessels, with each country free to allocate the tonnage of each class. This dispute over methods became a temporary obstacle at the beginning of the conference. Later, a compromise proposal put forward by France was adopted, which limited the total tonnage on the one hand, and stipulated the maximum and minimum limits on the tonnage of each class of warship on the other. In this way, some room for flexibility was still given to each country within the graded limitations. Therefore, there are no major disputes over the methods of limitation in general, but there are still many points of contention among the countries regarding the details. The technical committee has been discussing for several weeks, but has not yet fully determined the detailed methods of classification for each class.</p>
<p>However, although a consensus was勉强 achieved on the methods, the mentioning of the number of limitations revealed the true difficulties. The figures put forward by each country are mostly in absolute conflict, making it impossible to seek compromise even with great effort. Originally, the Washington Conference stipulated the tonnage ratio of battleships for the five powers as: Britain 5, the United States 5, Japan 3, France 1.75, Italy 1.75. At this London Conference, Great Britain, in order to seek overall peace, made every effort to concede to the United States, maintaining the principle of equality between Britain and the United States for auxiliary vessels. Therefore, on the surface, there are no major conflicts between Britain and the United States. However, Japan, France, and Italy are unwilling to apply the Washington Conference ratio to the limitation of auxiliary vessels. Japan demands that the tonnage of cruisers account for 70% of that of the United States, that is, increasing the ratio between the United States and Japan from 5:3 set by the Washington Conference to 5:3.5. The United States refuses to concede on this point. Secondly, France is particularly adamant. France, on the grounds of being the world's second largest colonial empire, demands to have sufficient naval power to protect its Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines, and the connections between France proper and its colonies. According to the demands put forward by France, France will become the world's largest naval power outside of Britain and the United States, which is the origin of the attacks by the British and Italian newspapers. Furthermore, Italy demands that its naval power be equal to that of the largest naval power on the continent, that is, equal to the naval power of France. Since the Washington Conference gave France and Italy the same ratio for battleships, Italy naturally has reason to make the same demand for auxiliary vessels.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the quantitative disputes between the United States and Japan, and the quantitative disputes between France and Italy, are the two major reefs of the London Conference. As soon as the conference touches these reefs, there is an immediate danger of rupture. The United States has already put forward a counter-proposal to Japan's proposal, willing to give Japan a considerable advantage in destroyers and submarines, while demanding that Japan not insist on the 70% ratio. However, two weeks have passed and Japan has not yet responded. It is rumored that the Japanese Minister of the Navy is threatening to resign, opposing the acceptance of the American counter-proposal. It is evident that it is still unknown whether the conflict between Japan and the United States can be resolved satisfactorily at present. As for the dispute between France and Italy, it seems to be increasingly tense recently. The newspapers of France and Italy are fiercely repelling each other. In fact, given Italy's financial capabilities, it is unable to engage in an arms race with France. However, in order to maintain his national authority, Mussolini is firmly unwilling to concede, and will certainly strive for equality between France and Italy. Although British Prime Minister MacDonald is doing his best to act as a mediator, there is still no room for compromise. As for France, it has indicated that it can concede on naval shipbuilding, but it must jointly conclude a Mediterranean Security Pact with countries such as Britain and the United States, so that when France is invaded along the Mediterranean coast, the British and American navies should provide assistance. Britain and the United States are unwilling to participate in the disputes between the continental countries and have refused one after another. Therefore, the dispute between France and Italy has become the biggest obstacle in the conference, and there is still no hope of resolution. Since France and Italy have caused disputes over numbers, some people think that France and Italy can be excluded and a naval agreement can be concluded between Britain, the United States, and Japan. In fact, it seems difficult to do so. The naval issue, the five major powers are mutually involved and inseparable. On the one hand, Britain claims that the British and American navies are equal, willingly giving up its maritime hegemony that it has monopolized for more than a hundred years, but on the other hand, it is still unwilling to give up its absolute advantage in Europe, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean. The British naval plan is to make its naval power equal to the combined military power of the two major naval powers in continental Europe (France and Italy). Therefore, if the limited quantities between France and Italy are not determined, then the British naval limitation cannot be determined either. If Britain cannot determine, then the United States, which demands equality with Britain, cannot determine its naval limitation. At the same time, the Japanese naval limitation, which regards Britain and the United States as the basis for its advance and retreat, is even more impossible to determine. One part affects the whole situation, which is why the London Conference is at a loss. The failure of the naval conference is now almost a foregone conclusion. Even if the conference can produce some results in the end, it will only be to preserve the face of the governments of various countries, and it may not be able to make any important decisions. However, although the conference itself is not worth much attention, the impact after its failure is enough to attract our attention. The conflicts of interest of the major powers have always relied on the peaceful rhetoric of diplomats to hide without declaring. If this conference fails completely, then the content will inevitably be revealed, the expansion of armaments by the powers will proceed at an accelerated pace, and there is a risk that military force will break through one day. Judging from the facts shown at this conference, the situation in the Mediterranean and the Pacific will be even more dangerous. In the Mediterranean, the rivalry between France and Italy, two Latin sisters, for hegemony in Europe has a long history. Recently, the newspapers of France and Italy have been commenting on naval events, uttering harsh words and not yielding to each other. At the same time, the German right-wing party and the fascist parties in the Balkan Peninsula are very active. In this serious situation, who believes that the League of Nations' Kellogg-Briand Pact can guarantee European peace? In the Pacific, the competition between Japan and the United States is also inevitable. Recently, the industrial and commercial prosperity of various capitalist countries has gradually surpassed its peak. All countries feel difficulties in the sales of industrial products and the export of capital, especially the two major emerging industrial countries, the United States and Japan. In order to compete for commercial interests in the East, they can use various methods such as politics, diplomacy, and finance to compete for leadership. But after these methods are exhausted, they cannot but resort to the final force. Let us not think that the negotiations of a few diplomats and military experts tens of thousands of miles away are irrelevant to our pain. (Sent from Paris by Hua Lu on March 22)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Chairman Chiang Passes Through Xuzhou and Bengbu on His Return to Nanjing <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Assembled Military Officers in Xuzhou on the Morning of the 10th for a Lecture</p>
<p>Inspected Barracks in Bengbu After Departing Xuzhou at Noon</p>
<p>Dispatch from Xuzhou: Commander-in-Chief Chiang arrived in Xuzhou yesterday morning. Due to rain, he was unable to review the troops. Today (the 10th), the weather is still not clear. He ordered all officers above the rank of company commander stationed in Xuzhou to assemble at Yunlong Stage outside Dongguan at 8:00 a.m. to listen to his lecture. Attendees included personnel from the Second Route Army and the Sixteenth Route Army headquarters, officers from the 1st and 3rd Divisions stationed in Xuzhou, personnel from the Third Aviation Team, and personnel from the Taiping and Huguang armored car teams, as well as the Beiping Team that had arrived from Jinan, totaling approximately 700 to 800 people. Liu Zhi, Gu Zhutong, Xu Tingyao, Chen Jicheng, and others were also present. Chiang arrived by car and began his lecture, with the main points as follows: (1) The Yan-Feng rebel party betrayed the country and can be said to have brought about their own destruction, and their internal divisions can be resolved without military force. (2) The Party's army has no enemies, as long as it always stands on the Party's position, obeys doctrine, and truly understands and practices it, it can naturally overcome everything. (3) The most important thing for revolutionary soldiers is to rectify discipline and clearly define rewards and punishments, so as to preserve their personal integrity and the reputation of the revolutionary army. The lecture ended at approximately 10:00 a.m. Liu Zhi then delivered a speech, explaining Commander-in-Chief Chiang's lecture and adding admonitions. During the lecture, additional guards were temporarily dispatched to the left and right of Yunlong Stage, and security was very tight. After Chiang returned to his car, he summoned more than ten regimental and battalion commanders from the 1st and 3rd Divisions who were due for promotion, including Yang Deliang, Li Yongzhang, Li Zhengxian, Li Wen, and Yu Jin Yuan, and gave them instructions. At 12:10 p.m., Chiang left Xuzhou by the original car to return to Nanjing. The Huguang armored car, still under the command of Qiu Pingsan, commander of the Second Battalion, led the way. Ma Hongkui, Chen Jicheng, Xu Tingyao, Liu Zhi, Gu Zhutong, Qian Zongze, and others came to the station to see him off. Chiang spoke with the generals in the car before departing south. According to Shao Lizi, Chiang met with Chen, Han, Ma, and others, so he did not go to Shandong. At present, the Central Government is still taking a defensive stance in the front, and will not attack unless the rebel army invades. In addition to Envoy Yao and Councilor Zhan, who went north last night, all those who came with Chiang returned, and so on.</p>
<p>Chiang Chu'ou, commander of the armored car forces, arrived in Xuzhou last night by the Taiping armored car and immediately paid his respects to Commander-in-Chief Chiang. He is currently staying briefly at the Xuzhou station. It is said that Chiang came to inspect the armored car teams. Sun Shengzhi, commander of the Beiping armored car team, was ordered last night to lead his team back to Xuzhou from Jinan. The Changcheng and Guizhou armored cars, which are on patrol, have not yet returned. Commander Sun told reporters that his team was ordered to wait for orders in Xuzhou and listen to the command of the Second Route Army. The defense of Jinan is being carried out by the Beiping, Taishan, and Shandong armored cars. As for the defense of the Tianjin-Pukou railway line, it is extremely solid, and the situation in the front is also very quiet, and so on. (April 10)</p>
<p>Dispatch from Bengbu: Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing by train from Xuzhou at 10:00 a.m. on the 10th. The Huguang armored car led the way.

In the afternoon, military and police units, mass organizations, officials of various organs, and representatives from all walks of life flocked to the station to greet him. Military police were deployed inside and outside the station and along the main roads, and security was tightened. At 4:30 p.m., the leading armored car arrived. At 5:00 p.m., Chiang's special train arrived from the north.

<h3 id="e73">Airplane Inspects Situation in Northern Shandong <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Dispatch from Jinan: The situation in northern Shandong recently has been the focus of attention from all sides. Shi Bangfan, deputy captain of the Second Aviation Team, flew north the day before yesterday to inspect along the railway line as far as Tianjin. He returned to Jinan safely after five hours. According to him, from north of Jinan to north of Pingyuan, only a small number of Jin army cavalry were seen moving back and forth. North of the Yellow River Cliff station, the Jin army had defensive works, but the number of people was very small. There was only one trainload of soldiers and one armored train in Dezhou, with no more than two battalions of people. From north of Dezhou, although there were defensive works in the Sangyuan, Zhuanhe, and Cangzhou areas, there were very few troops. In summary, there were less than one brigade of Jin army south of Cangzhou. North of Cangzhou, near Machang, along the embankment of the Hai River and the Grand Canal, the Jin army had built extremely strong defensive works, seemingly to defend against the south and the northeast. There were two trainloads of soldiers at Tianjin East Station. Overall, there were very few Jin troops along the road, and they immediately lay down in the trenches when they saw the airplane, showing extreme panic and no preparation for a southern attack.

<h3 id="e74">Situation of the Japanese Mine Warfare Fleet Arriving in Hankou <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Dispatch from Hankou: The First Mine Warfare Flotilla of Japan, consisting of fifteen destroyers, led by Rear Admiral Goto, commander of the Japanese Navy, aboard the flagship Naka, arrived in Hankou one after another at 12:00 noon on the 9th, and were berthed in the Japanese Concession on the river. The fleet, in addition to the flagship Naka, commanded by Goto, was divided into four squadrons. The first squadron consisted of four ships: the Kuretake, Wakatake, Sanae, and Sawarabi. The second squadron consisted of four ships: the Tsuta, Ogi, Susuki, and Fuji. The third squadron consisted of four ships: the Fuyou, Asagao, Bungei, and Karukaya. The fourth squadron consisted of three ships: the Hishi, Ashi, and Kawa. Each destroyer had one lieutenant commander, one ensign, one engineer ensign, one engineer, one mechanic, and a number of sailors, totaling more than 1,420 officers and sailors on all ships. When the fleet arrived in Hankou, it fired salutes to the Chinese Navy, and the Chinese warships stationed in Hankou returned the salutes to show their welcome. Japanese consuls and merchants were waiting on the riverbank, and all Japanese stores were flying flags.

This time, Rear Admiral Goto has come to China for sightseeing, and has come to Wuhan on the way. He will soon return to his country. The people of Wuhan hope that Rear Admiral Goto will make further progress in promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and further consolidate Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations after returning to his country. On behalf of the people of Wuhan, I would like to toast you and wish you good health), and so on. After the speech, Goto gave a reply. The banquet ended at 9:00 p.m. It is said that Goto has scheduled a banquet on the flagship Naka for Director He and others on the evening of the 10th, and will lead the fleet eastward to Wusong on the 11th.

<h3 id="e75">Qingdao British American Tobacco Company Labor Strike Escalates <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Dispatch from Qingdao: The British American Tobacco Company in this port, citing the presence of troublemakers among the workers, unilaterally suspended work last month, leaving more than 2,000 workers unemployed. The party and government authorities, concerned that too many unemployed workers would affect Qingdao's security, tasked the municipal government with negotiating with the manager of the British American Tobacco Company, requesting that it resume work as soon as possible. The company immediately put forward conditions such as stopping the labor movement and dismissing bad workers. The municipal government has accommodated them separately. As a result, both sides agreed to resume work on April 4. However, the workers, on the grounds that their living standards had increased in recent years but their wages had not, demanded that the company slightly increase their wages to maintain their livelihood. However, the company only agreed to take two dimes from each box of cigarettes to distribute to the workers, averaging less than one cent per worker. As a result, the workers were very dissatisfied and uniformly refused to resume work on that day, and petitioned the municipal government. The municipal government, believing that the workers were close to blackmail and were obviously being exploited by reactionary elements, immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest all nine of their representatives when the workers gathered for a meeting, and they were detained in the Public Security Bureau. On the 9th, the workers again planned to gather a crowd to petition the municipal government to release the arrested representatives. The Public Security Bureau received the news and sent a team to stop them. As a result, a conflict broke out between the workers and the police, injuring dozens of workers and arresting approximately 30 people. (April 9)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Two Major Projects on the Yellow River in Shandong <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Plugging the Breach at Hutantan Repairing the Spring Embankment</p>
<p>Dispatch from Jinan: This year, there are two major important projects on the Yellow River in this province: (1) plugging the breach at Hujiatan in Lijin; (2) the spring embankment project for the entire river. The former has already been estimated by the River Affairs Bureau to cost 119,000 yuan to plug the breach, while the latter has been requested by the River Affairs Bureau to cost 460,000 yuan. Although the projects are urgent, the Finance Department must wait for the approval of the River Affairs Bureau's higher-level agency before it can issue the funds. Therefore, as of now, not a single penny has been issued. The counties downstream of Lijin believe that if the breach at Hujiatan is not plugged as soon as possible, then the peach blossom flood will rise in an instant, making construction impossible. The people of several counties will suffer from fish floods. Therefore, they sent representatives to Jinan to appeal to the provincial government, the Finance Department, and the River Works Committee. At the last meeting of the provincial government committee, it was resolved to order the River Works Committee to review and issue the funds. This afternoon, the River Works Committee held its fifth regular meeting and resolved: (1) The 119,000 yuan for plugging the breach at Hujiatan will be sent to the provincial government to order the Finance Department to allocate the funds as soon as possible so that construction can begin. (2) The 460,000 yuan for the spring embankment requested by the River Affairs Bureau will first be submitted to the provincial government to order the Finance Department to allocate 190,000 yuan for materials within the budget in three installments: 80,000 yuan in the first installment, 60,000 yuan in the second installment, and 50,000 yuan in the third installment, so that materials can be purchased. The remaining 260,000 yuan will be submitted to the provincial government to order the Finance Department to allocate the funds after this committee sends personnel to survey and estimate. The disaster-stricken representatives from Lijin and other counties were all overjoyed to hear that plugging the breach at Hujiatan was scheduled and that the funds for the spring embankment were available, but it is not known whether the Finance Department will be able to allocate the funds as scheduled.

<h3 id="e77">Shandong Finance Department Returns Military Expenses Requested by Sun Liangcheng <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Dispatch from Jinan: Since the establishment of the Shandong Provincial Government in Tai'an, the military expenses requisitioned by former Chairman Sun Liangcheng in various counties amounted to a huge sum of more than 8 million yuan. After the provincial government moved to Jinan, the Finance Department believed that the military expenses requisitioned were all local public funds, and immediately ordered Li Hui, the chief of the Second Section of the department, to appoint specialists to actively sort out the matter. It took several months to complete the task. Subsequently, it was submitted to the provincial political conference for consideration of ways to repay the funds. The provincial government then issued the matter to the Economic and Financial Reorganization Committee for careful review and formulation of repayment standards, which were divided into three categories: (1) For those requisitioned by the provincial government and the Finance Department with printed receipts, it will be classified as the first category and will be repaid in installments over three years starting from the 19th year. (2) For the formal army units and supply stations that requisitioned funds with printed receipts, it will be repaid in installments over three years starting from the fourth year after the first category of funds has been approved for repayment. If there are no funds in the first category, it will be repaid in installments starting from the 19th year. (3) For the miscellaneous army that requisitioned funds freely and was supplied by the local government, and for the self-defense corps of the people that requisitioned funds, without orders from the provincial government and the department, it will be classified as the third category and will be cleared and repaid through special surcharges by the local government starting from the 19th year. This method has been reported to the provincial government and submitted to the conference for resolution, ordering the department to comply. Upon receiving this, the Finance Department immediately notified various counties, and printed four types of military expense repayment vouchers. Every day at 4:00 p.m., the department chief, Yuan Jiapu, convened the heads of the first, second, and third sections and the personnel in charge of the treasury in the office to review and fill out the vouchers. (Note: These military expense repayment vouchers are designated for offsetting local land tax and grain tax, and have the same effect as payment notices.) The department chief ordered the vouchers to be handed over to the finance bureaus of the respective counties for safekeeping, and they will be submitted for offsetting at the expiration date. Military expenses requisitioned from the miscellaneous tax items of various counties may be submitted for offsetting at any time. Yesterday (the 4th), for the new Second Brigade's military expenses advanced by Zouping County, which belonged to the treasury funds, totaling 90,661.94 yuan, 12 vouchers were issued in accordance with the first and second categories' method of repaying in installments over six years. The handling of military expense cases requisitioned by other counties is still under discussion. (April 9)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Completion of the Chang-Heng Highway in Hunan Province <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>He Jian Personally Attends the Ceremony and Visits Mount Heng, Changsha Correspondence: Mount Heng, Hengshan, is one of China's famous Five Sacred Mountains. The mountain is located in Hengshan County, Hunan. The Changsha to Hengzhou highway has now been completed. Liu Yuehou, the director of the Provincial Highway Bureau, specifically submitted a request to the Provincial Government for approval to hold the opening ceremony in Hengzhou on April 10th. He Jian, the chairman of the Provincial Government, invited all members of the Provincial Government, all members of the Provincial Party Department, consuls of various countries stationed in Hunan, the president of the High Court, and others to go to Hengzhou to attend the opening ceremony and visit Mount Heng. It is planned that they will depart from Changsha by car at 7:00 AM on the 10th and arrive in Hengzhou at 1:00 PM. The opening ceremony will be held in Hengzhou at 2:00 PM. At 6:00 AM on the 11th, they will travel by car from Hengzhou to Hengshan to visit Mount Heng, and will stay overnight in Hengshan that evening. At 6:00 AM on the 12th, they will return to the province by car from Hengshan, arriving in Changsha around 12:00 PM. All matters concerning meals and accommodation in Hengzhou will be the responsibility of the Highway Bureau. Su Yongqing, a section chief from the Fourth Route Headquarters, and Adjutant Wang Fu have been dispatched to Hengshan by steamer on the 9th to arrange all matters concerning meals and accommodation on Mount Heng. The Highway Bureau has prepared five cars for transportation. After He Jian leaves the province, the affairs of the Fourth Route Headquarters will be handled by Chief of Staff Guo Chiping. The affairs of the Anti-Banditry Headquarters will be handled by Chief of Staff Liu Qingchu, and the affairs of the 15th Division Headquarters will be handled by Chief of Staff Liu Yinggu. The duties of the Provincial Government will be handled by Secretary-General Yi Shuzhu, who will issue orders and then depart. (9th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Abnormal Movements of Yan Zhongru's Troops in Baoqing <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The troops of Yan Zhongru, the commander of the Independent 5th Brigade, were originally reorganized from the 156th Brigade of Wu Shang's former 52nd Division. Last year, a small part of Wang Pei's brigade of the Wu Division mutinied in Changde, and the name of the 52nd Division was abolished. The Yan Brigade was reorganized into the Training Brigade of the Newly Organized 8th Division. Unexpectedly, Zhou Lan's troops of the New 8th Division mutinied again in Baoqing and were led into Guangxi by Tang Shengming. The Yan Brigade then had no affiliation and was approved by He Jian to the General Headquarters to be reorganized into the Independent 5th Brigade, still under the control of He Jian. The Yan Brigade consisted of two regiments. The first regiment commander was Li Xuan, and the second regiment commander was Wan Fangzhi. Both had already been transferred from western Hunan to Baoqing for training. Recently, due to the rampant banditry in Jiangxi and the emergency situation in Pingxiang and Liuyang, He Jian ordered the entire Yan Brigade to move to Changsha and Xiangtan, intending to send them to Liuyang to suppress the bandits. Yan Zhongru himself moved from Baoqing to Changsha last week, and the headquarters was set up outside Xiaowumen at the Military Officer Training Institute. The Second Regiment, Wan Fangzhi, has also complied with the order and arrived in the Yijiawan area of Xiangtan to await orders. The First Regiment, Li Xuan, was originally scheduled to arrive in Changsha from Baoqing on the 8th, and the provincial capital had prepared accommodation. Unexpectedly, on the 7th, Li's regiment had an incident in Baoqing. First, they cut the telegraph lines, cutting off traffic between Baoqing and Changsha. The Chang-Bao bus service also stopped on the 8th. As for the actions of Li's regiment, because the telegraph lines were down and transportation was cut off, the provincial authorities have not yet received accurate reports. However, Tian Jifeng, the magistrate of Xiangxiang County, sent a telegram early on the 8th, saying that the troops in Baoqing had mutinied and that Li's army sentries had been posted to Wenzishan, which belongs to Yongfeng in Xiangxiang County, to guard against the provincial army. He Jian was very surprised to receive the report. In addition to sending personnel to investigate the truth for processing, he has also ordered Yan Zhongru to go to Xiangtan and Xiangxiang to handle matters as appropriate. (April 9)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Narrowing Down of Subsidiary Businesses of the Eastern Railway <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>A Committee Has Been Established to Conduct Reviews</p>
<p>Printing House and Publishing Department to Be Abolished</p>
<p>Harbin Communication, 6th: Regarding the case of using both Chinese and Russian languages passed by the Eastern Railway Board of Directors on the 25th of last month, the Board of Directors recently ordered the Railway Bureau to organize a committee to study implementation methods. It is heard that in the future, when implemented, the translation departments of various offices under the Railway Bureau will be removed and a separate compilation or translation office will be established. All documents promulgated by the Railway Bureau will be translated by this office, and the official documents submitted by the stations along the line to the Bureau will also be translated by it and then distributed. This method can not only supervise the abuse of power by Russian Bureau chiefs on our side, but also unify the official document format on the Bureau side. Regarding the Railway Bureau's reduction of subsidiary businesses, a committee has also been established by the Railway Bureau to begin reviewing. The scope of the reduction is approximately: (1) Pine Oil Manufacturing Plant, (2) Climate Sanatorium, (3) Restaurant, (4) Hotel, (5) Travel Agency, (6) Agricultural Experiment Field, (7) Milk Plant, (8) Milk Manufacturing Plant, (9) Cheese Manufacturing Plant, (10) Unimportant Business Agency, (11) Printing House, (12) Publishing Department, (13) Sawmill, (14) Sleeper Impregnation Plant, (15) Soda Factory. Among them, the business agency is particularly focused on by the Chinese side for reduction, because the business agency established by the Eastern Railway in major ports in Shanghai and Tianjin is not sufficient to offset expenditures in terms of income, and there is no need for such long-distance transportation in terms of transportation. In order to prevent the Russian side from using false pretenses to promote communism, at a minimum, it has also been decided to strive to reduce staff and streamline administration. As for the vehicles detained by the Ukrainian Railway, even after being handed over once, they are still not dispatched. The reason given is that during the time of Old Russia, 2,700 vehicles were detained by the Eastern Railway, and the Eastern Railway vehicles detained now can just offset this. The Chinese Director of the Eastern Railway believes that it concerns the property of the Qing Railway, so he urges the Railway Bureau to continue negotiations. Before Mo Dehui goes to Russia, it is planned to resolve all road cases related to affairs. It has also been decided to convene a board meeting next Wednesday (i.e., the 9th), with a total of eight agenda items, mostly for purchasing materials, houses, and construction projects. In terms of nature, they should be easily passed.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Jiangsu Provincial Government Distributes Saigon Rice <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The First Batch Is Distributed to Twenty Counties Including Jiangning</p>
<p>Each County Receives a Maximum of 105,000 Catties</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously received a letter from Committee Member Lu of the Food Regulation Committee regarding the purchase of Saigon rice (specifically to relieve the food shortage panic in various counties), which is about to arrive in Zhenjiang. He requested that various measures be planned in advance. After the 281st Provincial Committee meeting, it was decided that Committee Member He Yushu should liaise with the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce to handle the distribution of rice. Now, after repeated consultations between He and the Chamber of Commerce, a distribution plan has been drafted and approved by the Provincial Government's 283rd meeting yesterday. The plan is as follows:</p>
<p>Distribution Area: According to the autumn survey report of the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Agriculture Committee last year, the following nineteen counties with more than 30% disaster severity are designated as the distribution area for this batch of rice: Jiangning, Jiangpu, Liuhe, Xinghua, Dongtai, Baoying, Gaoyou, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Liyang, Funing, Yancheng, Kunshan, Lianshui, Tongshan, Fengxian, Xiaoxian, Suining, and Ganyu. However, the Department of Agriculture and Mines previously purchased a large batch of rice seeds in Taixian and transported them to Yancheng, Funing, Xinghua, and Baoying for lending. At that time, it was stated that when this batch of Saigon rice arrived, it would be appropriately returned for relief. Therefore, although the disaster situation in these counties is below 30%, they are still included in the distribution area to fulfill the previous agreement.</p>
<p>Distribution Quantity: The Saigon rice purchased this time totals 1,500 tons. The Provincial Government will order the Department of Agriculture and Mines to telegraph the county governments of Jiangning and the other twenty counties, consult with the chambers of commerce of each county, consider the needs, and send personnel to Zhenjiang to pick up the rice with funds before April 20th. However, each county shall not exceed 105,000 catties.</p>
<p>Rice Price: The price of this batch of Saigon rice, including transportation costs, is approximately 15.5 yuan per 150 catties. Compared to the current market price, each bag is approximately two yuan cheaper. The government's purchase of foreign rice is originally intended to regulate the people's food supply, and it does not seem necessary to strictly comply with the market price, let alone make money from it. Therefore, the price will be fixed at 15.5 yuan per 150 catties and distributed to the counties. The counties will then add the cost of water and deduct the actual amount for distribution and sale to poor households to benefit the poor.</p>

<p>Six Kidnapped Victims from Zhangyan Town Rescued</p>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The gangs of Zhang Zhaohua and Taibao Ashu from Yangcheng Lake, after being defeated by the anti-bandit army, navy, police in Shengjiabang of Fenghu and Da Yao of Chefang this month, the Zhang Zhaohua gang from Haizhou sneaked back to Yangcheng Lake on the 9th. After the anti-bandit army found out, they secretly reported to the General Command. Commander Hu then ordered the troops and Director Gong of the Third District of the Water Police to supervise the patrol boats of the Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Squadrons of the Water Police to arrive at the beach along Yangcheng Lake by the morning of the 11th to encircle the bandit boats of the Zhang Zhaohua gang and cooperate in suppressing them. Yesterday morning (11th) at about 6:00 AM, Xu Boying, the captain of the Eleventh Squadron of the Water Police, personally led his squadron of fourteen patrol boats to Louzitou near Weijingtang Town on the shore of Yangcheng Lake and anchored. He immediately sent out detectives to scout for bandit tracks. He learned that the Zhang gang had a total of twenty-two bandit boats with more than 300 bandits. The boats were hiding more than 20 kidnapped victims from Zhangyan Town, Jinshan. They sailed to Yangcheng Lake on the 10th and arrived at Taiping Bridge on the morning of the 11th. Captain Xu received the report and led his squadron to Taiping Bridge. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at Taiping Bridge, the bandits had turned to Weijingtang. Captain Xu had no choice but to return to Weijingtang. At that time, it was about 1:00 PM. Captain Xu also learned from scouts that the bandits were staying in Louzitou. Captain Xu then ordered the first, second, and third squads to encircle and advance in three routes. At about 3:00 PM, they finally encircled the bandit boats. The bandits, seeing the arrival of the government troops and running out of ammunition, tried to find a way out but could not. Zhang Zhaohua then ordered the bandits to open fire and resist arrest. Captain Xu also ordered his squadron to counterattack and opened fire for four hours until about 7:00 PM when it ceased. The bandits, seeing the situation was not good, fled for their lives. In this battle, Captain Xu shot down three bandit boats, seized four rifles, and rescued six kidnapped victims, male and female, from Zhangyan Town, as well as a boatman and his wife. This morning (12th), he led the team back to Suzhou to report to the district headquarters. Director Gong immediately interrogated the kidnapped victims one by one. It was learned that the female victim, Zhang Xiumei, was 29 years old and from Zhangyan Town. She was kidnapped by the Haizhou gang when they looted the town on the 1st of this month. Her father's name is Zhang Qifeng, who runs the Zhang Jisheng Pharmacy, and her brother's name is Xuenian, who is a doctor. When the bandits looted the town, Xiumei's parents were not at home, only her brother and sister were in the store. It was heard that when the bandits looted, she and her brother hid on the roof of a neighbor's house, but were seen by the bandits, who threatened them with guns and kidnapped Zhang Xiumei and her brother together and put them on a boat. Then they robbed a small steamer and sailed to Guanwang Temple to distribute the spoils. On the 5th, Zhang Xuenian was released first and ordered to go back and prepare 10,000 yuan to redeem his sister at the Yangcheng Lake. The next day (6th), the bandits burned incense at Guanwang Temple and were repelled by the anti-bandit army at about 6:00 PM. The bandits then fled with the kidnapped victims. The other five kidnapped victims, (1) Huang Gongshou, 11 years old, (2) Huang Quqing, 14 years old, (3) Huang Wenjun, 13 years old, (4) Yao Shuping, 14 years old, (5) Yao Jiping, 13 years old, are all from Zhangyan and were kidnapped from the Second Primary School in Jinshan County. The boatmen Chen Abing and his wife Ru were shot and injured by the bandits at the time. After Director Gong's questioning, he sent personnel to the Tiancizhuang Bo Xi Hospital to treat the injured boatmen Chen Abing and his wife. The other six kidnapped victims were ordered to be escorted by Inspector Ma Lumei to the General Command to request instructions. Commander Hu, after confirming that they were indeed kidnapped victims, appointed Inspector Hong of the Sixth Branch of the Yan District to send Zhang Xiumei and the other six to a hotel to live in and notified their families to come to Suzhou to pick them up. It is heard that the bandit gangs of Zhang Zhaohua and Taibao Ashu have fled to Yuanjiahuling in Qingpu New Town and Yangsanta Temple in Yangcheng Lake.</p>
<p>Another Correspondence: Xu Boying, the captain of the Eleventh Squadron of the Third District of the Water Police, was ordered by Director Gong the night before to lead his squadron's first squad leader Yu Hongxun, second squad leader Wang Qi, third squad leader Gu Dingkui with fourteen boats to depart from Suzhou to Yangcheng Village (this village is a small island in the middle of Yangcheng Lake, surrounded by water, with an area of about ten square li) to search, but found no trace of bandits. So they returned to Weijingtang. When the boats were traveling, they hired many civilian boats to sail in front, and the gunboats were hidden behind the civilian boats to avoid the target of the bandits. At 2:30 PM yesterday (11th), it was learned that the bandits were in Louzitou (this place is two li south of Taiping Bridge and five or six li north of Weijingtang), with twenty-two boats and about 300 bandits. It was a merger of the Mao Zilong and Zhang Zhaohua gangs from Haizhou. They then drummed the boats forward, and after seeing the bandit tracks, they landed and dispersed at a distance of 1,500 meters, ordering the second squad leader Wang Qi to take charge of the right wing, the third squad Gu Dingkui to take charge of the left wing, and Captain Xu himself led the squadron leader Yu to take charge of the middle road to bombard the bandits. The bandits also landed and attacked. The bandits were all wearing black short clothes and had four mobile machine guns, more than forty Mauser pistols, and more than one hundred rifles. During the fierce battle, the bandit leader blew the horn to direct the battle. The water police also blew the horn, because the water police had four bugles, they blew them all together, using the sound of the bugles to create chaos. From 3:00 PM, the fierce battle continued until 8:00 PM, killing five or sixty bandits. The bandits then collapsed and fled towards Yangyi Lake. The water police then bravely pursued. The road was muddy after the rain, and the policemen fell and got up. They crossed three river surfaces and chased for five or six li. As a result, they seized three bandit boats, four firearms, and rescued six kidnapped victims. On the water police side, squadron leader Yu fell and coughed up blood. Zhang Maosheng, a policeman from the second patrol boat of the first squadron (18 years old, from Lili), was shot in the lower jaw and had three front teeth knocked out (now sent to the Gospel Hospital). About six or seventy water police were on the front line in this battle. The rescued kidnapped victims were (1) Huang Wenjun (13 years old, style name Shuping, lives at the junction of Zhangyan and Hengpu), (2) Huang Gongshou (11 years old, style name Lianfang, brother of Wenjun), (3) Huang Quqing (14 years old, brother of Gongshou), (4) Yao Shuping (14 years old, lives in Yaojiawan, Zhangyan, father's name is Hongfei), (5) Yao Jiping (13 years old, brother of Shuping), the above five are all boarders at the Second Higher Primary School in Jinshan County, (6) Zhang Xiumei (29 years old, lives east of the Zhangyan Town Banqiao, father's name is Zhang Qifeng, 66 years old, mother's name is Pan, 62 years old, brother's name is Yaonian, 40 years old, one older sister and one younger sister, both married, I am unmarried because there are few people in my family.)</p>
<p>According to Zhang Xiumei, on the third day of the third lunar month (April 1st), when a large gang of lake bandits looted Zhangyan, there were more than thirty boats. Four bandits went to her house to rob and kidnapped her and her brother together. They disembarked north of the river. The bandit boat where her brother and sister were staying was larger and had five bandits. Among the five bandits, there were three bandit leaders, one named Boss Yan, one named Boss Cao, and one was called Old Old Man by the crowd, but his name was unknown. Initially, after the bandits distributed the spoils at Guanwang Temple, they sailed to a temple. After arriving there, the bandits drove all the kidnapped victims ashore, and the bandit leader Zhang Zhaohua interrogated them one by one. The bandit leader was about forty years old, wearing a small hat and a camel-hair robe, with small blisters on his face and a fierce appearance. Seeing that the kidnapped victims at this time were all men, women, old, and young, some women were holding babies, and some couples were crying together, it was extremely miserable. The bandit leader was very strict during the interrogation and took notes while asking questions to determine the ransom price. The amount of the price depended on how much family property each person answered. In addition to the students being kidnapped from the Jinshan Second High School, there were also the principal Wang Chenchu and teachers Zhang (sports), Lin Mingjian, and Zhou Gengxin. Now one person, Lin Zhou, has escaped danger, but Principal Wang and Teacher Zhang are still trapped by the bandits. When the bandit leader asked a partner from a certain bowl shop, because he replied that he had no money, he was shot and killed and his body was abandoned in the lake. Then the bandits ordered her brother Yaonian to go back to negotiate and send letters to the families to prepare the ransom tickets. She wanted to go back with him, but the bandit leader did not allow it. So she asked her brother to consult with the bandit leader Boss Yan about what to do if there was any indecency. She was allowed to be responsible for protection, and Yaonian also negotiated with the bandit to move the five students Huang Wenjun and others from Ergao to her boat to accompany her. These five students are very innocent and cheerful, and the bandits all call them (Five Gods of Wealth). After her brother returned on the 5th, the bandits once tricked the five students Huang Wenjun and others to leave the boat to commit indecency, but the bandit shouted and stopped them. Fortunately, they were not insulted. When she was kidnapped and disembarked, she was wearing leather clothes because it was cold. She remembered that on one of the hottest days, the bandits ordered the female victims on other boats to go ashore for a walk and changed the clothes they had robbed for them, but she did not receive this preferential treatment. She also said that the bandit boat was sailing day and night, never stopping. The bandit leader had a password to transmit to each boat every day. The bandits on her boat did not know how to read much, so the five students Huang Wenjun and others read it for them. It roughly consisted of (love), (compatriot), (agreement), (peace), (consensus) and other words, written in pencil. From the 6th, they fought with the government troops four times. The first time was the most intense, and the firing lasted for two and a half hours. The old old man on her boat was shot and killed by the government troops, and the body was dragged back by the bandits, placed at the bow of the boat, and abandoned at night. Later, there were two more fights. When the fire was opened, the five young students Huang and others were lying beside her. When the bandits were robbing, they wrapped red and green cloth strips around their arms as a sign. Usually, they used passwords. This time, the water police opened fire, and bullets were flying everywhere. Her boat was also hit by many bullets. It is expected that the two boats seized by the other water police also had kidnapped victims, but they had already escaped. Zhang, a manager of a pawnshop in Zhangyan, was beaten the worst among the kidnapped victims.</p>
<p>Now the Eleventh Squadron has returned to the city today, and the seized firearms, boats, and kidnapped victims have been sent to the district headquarters. Among the four firearms seized, two have the Lushui imprint. Also, the boatmen Chen Abing and Chen Ru were rescued at the same time, and their feet have been shot by bandit bullets.</p>
<p>In the southeast area of ​​Yunzi Mountain in Yangcheng Lake, the military and police opened fire with bandits from 9:00 AM today, stopping for about an hour. They made contact again from 2:00 PM, and had not stopped as of 6:00 PM. The sound of rifles and machine guns was heard very clearly at the Waitangkou Station. The location seemed to be in the Maota area, seven miles away from Waitangkou Station.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Yesterday, Both Chinese and Concession Areas Were Heavily Guarded <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>City Order Remained Normal</p>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the Party Purification. The British and French Concession authorities both ordered discreet security measures. Yuan, Director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Public Security Bureau, was particularly strict about defense within the concessions and had previously consulted with the concession authorities to coordinate defense and provide mutual assistance in case of incidents. From 10:00 AM yesterday, the Bureau ordered all supervisors and male and female investigators to go to various district offices in shifts to supervise the police chiefs and conduct large-scale inspections in key areas. After 5:00 PM, preparations were even more stringent. Therefore, the city's order remained normal and peaceful.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Foreign Minister Wang Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting arrived at the North Station at around 7:00 AM yesterday by overnight express train from Beijing and returned to his residence on Guba Road. He went to the Foreign Affairs Discussion Meeting on Shanzhong Road at around 10:00 AM to review important official documents from the Shanghai office. He telephoned Zhang Weihan, the former Yunnan negotiator, to discuss the Sino-French commercial treaty. However, when Zhang arrived at the discussion meeting with the special envoy to Yunnan from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang had already left for a banquet and they did not meet.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Motives for Signing the Sino-French Commercial Treaty <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Received Note from French Envoy on the 9th</p>
<p>Telegraphed Shanghai to Retain Zhang Weihan, Temporarily Prevent Return to Yunnan</p>
<p>Zhendan News Agency reports: The Sino-French commercial treaty was once suspended due to the issue of new taxes in Yunnan. After Hu Shize, secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, went to Beijing, he contacted the French envoy, but the French side delayed and the French envoy did not go south as scheduled and did not reply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' telegrams. Zhang Weihan, our Yunnan negotiator attending the meeting, had also purchased a boat ticket and was preparing to return to Yunnan on the 15th of this month. However, recently, the atmosphere of Sino-French negotiations has become active again. On the 9th of this month, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a note from French envoy Madé, stating that he would go south soon to sign the Sino-French commercial treaty. Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting also telegraphed Shanghai to retain Zhang Weihan and suspend his return to Yunnan, waiting for the French envoy to go south. It is reported that Zhang will meet Foreign Minister Wang in Shanghai for instructions before deciding on his next steps.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Commercial Reorganization Council Requests Speedy Conclusion of Egyptian Commercial Treaty <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Commercial Reorganization Council submitted a document to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating: "The increase in import taxes on tobacco leaves in Egypt has caused significant losses to our country due to the lack of a commercial treaty with that country, almost leading to a complete halt in exports. Please forward this request to the Ministry, requesting a speedy negotiation of a commercial treaty to save the situation." On the 8th of this month, a letter was received from the Shanghai Tobacco Leaf Association, stating: "Our country's tobacco leaves have always been exported to Egypt, with a large volume exported annually. Between 1918 and 1919, our country's exported tobacco leaves paid an import tax of 25 to 30 piastres per kilo (Egyptian currency). Later, our country's exported tobacco leaves were specially improved and exports greatly increased. Egypt's import tax also increased accordingly, from 30 piastres to 70 piastres per kilo. As a result, tobacco merchants stopped exporting, and exports gradually decreased, eventually falling to several dozen items per year. In recent years, the country has been levying 90 piastres per kilo on tobacco leaf imports, causing our country's exports to become even scarcer. This is the situation of Egypt's increased tobacco leaf import taxes, with our country's tobacco leaf exports decreasing year by year, almost coming to a complete halt in recent years. Tobacco leaves have been hit hard, with business plummeting. There are more than tens of millions of planting households in the producing areas. Maritime transportation has stopped, and livelihoods are being threatened. Tobacco merchants in Shanghai have accumulated a mountain of goods purchased in previous years, suffering huge losses. The goods have no market, and finance is stagnant, greatly affecting the tobacco leaf industry. It is also heard that the country's new regulations provide extra preferential treatment for countries with treaties. Our country does not have a commercial treaty, so there is no hope of reducing the import tax on our country's tobacco leaves, but instead it has been doubled, starting from March 17th, to 180 piastres per kilo (calculated at 17 shillings and 1 pence per piastre, totaling approximately 1.9 yuan in Shanghai currency per kilo, which is 2.25 pounds). If no rescue measures are taken quickly, our country's tobacco leaves will no longer be able to be exported to Egypt, tobacco merchants and planting households will suffer greatly, and the impact on commerce and people's livelihood will be profound and huge. In order to save past losses and plan for future development, the association hereby requests your esteemed association to forward this request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to quickly negotiate a treaty with Egypt to reduce the import tax on tobacco leaves, etc. The tobacco merchants will be very grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs." It was noted that this matter was thoroughly stated by the former General Chamber of Commerce in 1927, detailing the different tax rates for countries with and without treaties for imported tobacco leaves, and requesting the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce in Beijing to forward this request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for speedy negotiation of a commercial treaty to save the situation, and the association also elected representatives to go to the capital to petition. However, three years have passed and the commercial treaty has not been completed, and the country's tobacco leaf import tax has been further increased. Our Chinese tobacco leaves will no longer be able to be imported into that country. In desperation, the association reiterates its previous request and respectfully requests your esteemed Ministry to review and approve the previous case, quickly negotiate a commercial treaty with that country, and strive to remedy the situation. The tobacco merchants will be most grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>The German Industrial Mission, invited by the National Government to visit China, is scheduled to enter Beijing tonight. The Shanghai Special Municipality Government, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Commercial Reorganization Council, the Academia Sinica, and 48 other organizations hosted a public banquet at the Commercial Reorganization Council last night, with more than 80 people attending. Mayor Zhang presided over the banquet and delivered a welcoming speech. Cai Yuanpei, Yu Qiaqing, and others delivered speeches. Mr. Retzmann, the general representative of the German Industrial Mission, delivered a reply. The Municipal Public Bureau military band played music.

<p>Yang Wenjun Temporarily Serves as Chief Prosecutor</p>
<p>The position of President of the Shanghai District Court, left vacant after Yang Zhaosun was transferred to the Special District Court, has been filled by Shen Bingqian, the Chief Prosecutor of the Court, who has been promoted to Acting President by the Ministry of Justice. The order was received several days ago, but because Shen's position as Chief Prosecutor was still awaiting the arrival and handover of the new appointee, Liu Maochu, both were to be sworn in together. However, Liu has not yet arrived. Therefore, Shen formally took office as President of the Court yesterday morning, to be followed by a swearing-in ceremony later. At 9:00 AM, Shen held a simple seal-receiving ceremony in the first courtroom of the court. Therefore, no invitations were sent to various circles. After receiving the seal, a Yuanhao notice was issued, stating: "For the matter of the notice, it is hereby proclaimed that Shen Bingqian has been appointed Acting President of the Jiangsu Shanghai District Court by Order No. 645 of the Ministry of Justice. He assumed office on April 12, 1930, and a supplementary swearing-in ceremony will be held on another date, and the relevant reports will be submitted separately. This notice is hereby issued to inform all litigants and others under the jurisdiction of the court." Because the position of Chief Prosecutor has not yet been filled by a new appointee, President Shen has temporarily appointed Yang Wenjun, a prosecutor of the court, to act as Chief Prosecutor.</p>

<p>Unable to Meet Police Expenses</p>
<p>Shen Jinghua, Director of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, is currently unable to cope with the police expenses. Although the Jiangsu Department of Finance has provided a subsidy of 2,000 yuan, the accumulated debt is already huge, making it a drop in the bucket. The directors of various sub-bureaus have already pawned almost everything. In recent days, they have been coming to the city to demand back pay. Shen himself lacks the Midas touch and is unable to cope. Currently, the food supply for the police officers is unsustainable, and he is deeply concerned that they may be driven to desperate measures, with dire consequences. Rather than delaying the matter, it is better to resign early. Therefore, he submitted a report to the county government yesterday, requesting that someone be appointed to replace him.</p>

<p>After eighteen warships from the Japanese First Torpedo Squadron came to China, they freely sailed to Nanjing, Hankou, and other places along the Yangtze River. Despite unanimous opposition from various circles, the squadron not only failed to restrain themselves and retreat but will also sail from Wusong to the vicinity of Zhoushan on the 16th to conduct large-scale spring maneuvers with all the warships. This is a disregard for our national sovereignty. Upon hearing the news, various community groups and party branches in this city have protested. The Coal Industry Reorganization Committee, the Fifth District Party Headquarters, the Third District Party Headquarters, the Ninth Branch of the Third District, the Twenty-First Branch of the Second District, and the Tenth Branch of the Fifth District have all sent telegrams to express their opposition, with extremely strong language.</p>

<p>Those Without 100 Yuan and With Calloused Hands Are Not Allowed to Disembark</p>
<p>Chinese traveling to Japan for tourism or business have been repeatedly denied disembarkation and deported back to China. Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has negotiated with the Japanese authorities, Japanese officials have declared that there is no such thing as excluding Chinese from traveling to Japan. However, according to Mr. Wu, a restaurant merchant who was deported from Japan, Chinese traveling to Japan, except for wealthy merchants, are welcomed to disembark. Other businessmen or workers (such as those in the kimono, restaurant, chef, barber, and other craft industries) must have their hands examined by Japanese customs officers and police detectives for callouses, and their luggage checked for at least 100 yuan in cash. Those without cash and calloused hands are not allowed to disembark.</p>

<p>Purge Commemoration Meeting The meeting was held in the auditorium at 9:00 AM yesterday. The chairman reported on the original intention of the Party's accommodation of the Communists in the thirteenth year, and the reasons for purging the Communists in the sixteenth year. He also mentioned the domestic situation in recent years, hoping that all party members would strengthen their faith, continue to strive, urge the government to work hard on construction, reduce the suffering of the people, and not create opportunities for the Communists again. This, he argued, is the true meaning of commemorating the purge of the Communists. Qian Danquan then reported on the atrocities of the Communists in Wuhan, the process of purging the Communists in Wuhan, and the reasons why the Communists were able to steal party power within the party, providing a detailed analysis of the responsibilities of party members in the future. Lu Juefei, Tao Yishan, and others gave speeches successively, and the meeting adjourned after shouting slogans.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Notes on Shipping Accidents <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>"Ningshao" Damages a Pontoon The Old Ningshao steamboat of the Ningshao Company, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Hankou, ran into an accident. On the afternoon of the 10th, at 5:30, when the ship arrived at Pukou, it was docking at the China Merchants Wharf in that port. At that time, the Jiangtian steamboat was also docked there in preparation for He Yingqin's trip to Hankou. The Ningshao steamboat had to change its course to the Sanbei Wharf. At this moment, the tide was strong. When the Ningshao steamboat was turning around, it had to avoid a warship and collided with the Wuxiang and Jiangtian steamboats, causing the ship's hull to crash into the pontoon bridge of the Jinpu Railway. The outer hull of the pontoon was damaged by the Ningshao. The shipowner, Eddie Gren, reported the incident upon returning to Shanghai yesterday, and the Ningshao has sent a letter to the Jinpu Railway Bureau stating that it will be responsible for the repairs if the accident is found to be the fault of the Ningshao.</p>
<p>British Ship Runs Aground Shanghai News The Beijing City, a ship managed by the Shanghai British trading firm Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Ltd., which specializes in the Shanghai-London route, has a load capacity of 6,700 tons and was built in 1920.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>This time, the ship was coming to Shanghai from Europe. It first went to Vladivostok to load groceries, then to Dalian to transport soybeans. Unexpectedly, when sailing in the Korean Sea near Geomun Island on the morning of the 10th, at 5:00 AM, there was heavy fog. The ship ran aground on a reef about fifteen nautical miles northeast of Geomun Island. The bottom of the front cabin was pierced by the reef, and seawater rushed into the ship, causing it to sink immediately. Eighty-one passengers on board gathered on the deck. The crew gave them life jackets, and they were preparing to abandon ship when the captain urgently sent out an SOS distress signal. At that time, a fishing boat from the Hayashi Gumi Company in Shimonoseki, Japan, happened to be in the area and received the alert. Spotting a flare, it came to the rescue and evacuated the eighty-one passengers and part of the crew to Geomun Island for temporary shelter. Later, the management office of the Ellerman Lines in Japan received a telegram about the Beijing City's accident and dispatched the Japanese ship Ocean Maru to the rescue, transporting the passengers and crew to Japan first. The Beijing City's hull, with cargo in each cabin, gradually sank into the sea after taking on water, and there is little hope of salvage. There were also goods from Shanghai on board. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on May 3rd and depart for England and Germany on May 5th. Now, the local branch of the company has received a telegram and canceled the export schedule. It is reported that none of the crew or passengers were injured.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Record of Foreign Merchants Seizing Yangtze River Shipping <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai shipping merchants are planning to salvage Yangtze River shipping, and more ships have recently resumed service. Since Chinese ships reduced their services last year, foreign merchants have seized most of the freight transport on the Yangtze River ports. It will take a lot of effort to recover this business. Shanghai shipping merchants consider the Yangtze River shipping as the most important inland route in China. If this route cannot be salvaged, Chinese ships will never have a chance to expand. A recent investigation into the business seized by foreign merchants has yielded shocking results, which are detailed below.</p>
<p>Loss of 80% of Freight Charges There are currently six shipping companies operating between Shanghai and Hankou, including Chinese, British, and Japanese companies. Chinese merchants own three of these companies. Although they have twenty ships, less than one-third of them have been operating during the past year. British and Japanese ships, on the other hand, have twenty-six ships that regularly travel between the two ports. On average, foreign ships can make eighteen or nineteen trips per week, while Chinese ships only make three or four trips. Chinese merchants have found that the freight charges for goods shipped from Hankou to Shanghai amount to 4 million taels per year. Last year, Chinese shipping companies only received 25% of the total annual revenue, while foreign companies such as Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nisshin received 75% (3 million taels) of the freight revenue.</p>
<p>Cotton Transportation Dominated by Foreign Merchants The largest cargo shipped from Hankou to Shanghai is cotton. The provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, Hunan, and Hubei can produce 9 million dan of cotton per year. After deducting the cotton transported to other ports, about 1.6 million bales are shipped to Shanghai. Currently, there are six cotton mills in Hankou, including the First, Zhenhuan, Yuhua, Shenxin, and Chu'an mills, and more than thirty cotton firms, mostly operated by people from Xianning. Three of these mills pack and ship cotton to Shanghai every year, making it a major source of cargo for ships on the Yangtze River. After Chinese ships suspended their services last year, British and Japanese ships competed fiercely for cotton transportation. Last year, Taikoo Company's cotton transport volume increased sharply from 150,000 bales to 400,000 bales. Nisshin Company also increased its volume from 230,000 bales to 400,000 bales. Jardine Matheson increased its volume to 300,000 bales, and Xiangtai Lines also transported a significant amount. Chinese ships, however, only got a small fraction of the business.</p>
<p>Dockworkers Come to Shanghai for Assistance After the labor unrest at the Lingjiang Company in Chongqing, British and Japanese ships ignored the issue and continued to transfer ships from the upper reaches to Shanghai to operate on the Shanghai-Yichang route, refusing to accept any wage increases. After the Yichang Dockworkers' Union demanded wage increases and went on strike in April, the foreign ships in the upper reaches treated the dockworkers in the same way as they treated the Lingjiang workers. However, the workers had to work to make a living, and any work stoppage would harm their livelihood. Foreign merchants were determined not to compromise. It has been confirmed that the Yichang Dockworkers' Union has decided to send representatives from Yichang to Shanghai to seek assistance from the Shanghai General Labor Union and negotiate wage increases with the shipping companies in order to protect their livelihood and avoid being oppressed by foreign merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Record of Shipping Representatives Petitioning in the Province <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Revocation of River Management Fees</p>
<p>Former Director Wang of the Jiangsu Construction Department proposed in July last year to collect 5% of the revenue from both passenger and cargo tickets of inland small steamships as river management fees. He also issued collection rules and set a deadline for mandatory collection, which led to shipping merchants in various ports requesting their respective shipping associations to appeal for exemption. The Shanghai Shipping Association convened a joint meeting of various associations and stated that commercial ships were burdened with numerous taxes. They sent telegrams to the central party headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry and Commerce, as well as the provincial party headquarters and the provincial government, requesting revocation. The Ministry of Transportation approved the request, but the provincial government replied that it had been approved through meetings and was not easy to approve. The Chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Association, Yu Qiaqing, telegraphed President Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government, requesting him to sympathize with the merchants and order the provincial government to revoke the fees. Representatives have gone to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Transportation and the Executive Yuan, but the issue has not been resolved. It is now heard that the representatives went to the province the day before yesterday, at the beginning of the reorganization of the provincial government and the beginning of the renovation of politics. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Shanghai representative Zha Hongbin, Suzhou representative He Shaotang, Wuxi representatives Zhang Jianmen and Shen Xijun, Wujin representative Shao Boan, Nanjing representative Pan Xieting, and Zhenjiang representative Tao Shoubai went to the provincial government to petition. Secretary-General Jin of the provincial government met with them and was well aware of the shipping merchants' suffering. He promised to forward their intention to the chairman for review. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, they went to the Construction Department to petition. Director Sun met with them personally. The representatives described the various burdens of the shipping merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, as well as the decline in business and the bandit situation.

The representatives were satisfied and bid farewell.</p>

<p>The China National Products Maintenance Association and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association held a grand welcome meeting for Korean Consul General Zhang Weicheng at 3:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Wang Jie presided over the meeting and invited Mr. Zhang to report on the situation. Mr. Zhang stood up and reported that after arriving in Korea, he inspected Zhennampo, Pyongyang, Wonsan, and other places, and found that many shops established by overseas Chinese were flourishing. Not only were the overseas Chinese fond of using national products, but the Korean people were also happy to buy them. Nearly three million pieces of Chinese grass cloth are exported to Korea every year, but the import of domestic silk products is very small due to the jealousy of the Japanese and the heavy taxes imposed. He has negotiated with the Japanese side, but has not yet reached an agreement, and he feels very ashamed. He hoped that everyone present would give him advice so that he could have a guideline to follow. Then, Mr. Wang and others spoke successively to discuss solutions. The meeting adjourned until the evening. Cao Puchang, the representative of the Korean grass cloth industry, also hosted a banquet for Zhang Weicheng at the Pacific Western Restaurant at 7:00 PM last night. During the banquet, in addition to Mr. Zhang's report on the position of national products in Korea, they also discussed issues such as increasing trade with Korea.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Another Surge in Chinese Silk Exports to the US <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Due to Expected Increase in Import Tariffs by the US Government</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a surge in Chinese silk exports to the United States. Two company ships exported more than 4,000 bales of raw silk, worth about 5 million yuan, in the past two days. A large number of shipments to the United States are expected in the next few days. This is because there are rumors that the US government will increase import tariffs on Chinese silk starting next month. Therefore, Chinese silk merchants are taking advantage of this opportunity to export as much as possible. However, if the US government actually implements the increase in import tariffs, the sales of Chinese silk in the US will be greatly affected in the future.</p>

<p>The wages of the employees hired by the rope makers are calculated on a monthly basis. In recent years, due to the rising cost of living, the wages earned by the employees have not been enough to cover their expenses. They have been requesting wage increases from their respective shops. Since last year, the shop owners have made some wage increases. Now, the employees of the shops that have not made any wage increases are making requests to their shop owners and informing them of the wage increases made by other shops. The shop owners are not pleased and have suspended more than ten employees. The employees discussed the matter and decided that the wages in their industry are too low, with the highest wages being only ten yuan per month. In the face of rising prices, they should be increased. They must seek uniform implementation, starting with an investigation of the wage levels in each shop and increasing them according to the highest wage. After the investigation is completed, they will hold another meeting to discuss the amount of the increase.</p>

<p>The Nationalist Society reports that the Shanghai Labor Unions' Support Association for Pharmaceutical Workers has warned the employees of Hu Qingyu and Cai Tongde drugstores: The employees of the two drugstores, in this case, the pharmaceutical capitalists have unreasonably refused to make accommodations, defied government orders, incited labor unrest, disregarded the lives of the people, colluded with imperialism, arrested workers, and undermined the labor movement. They have no regard for the law. All those with blood and spirit are filled with righteous indignation and will use all their strength to assist the pharmaceutical workers and fight to the end with the evil capitalists. The Association has just been established, and it has heard that the employees of the two drugstores, Hu Qingyu and Cai Tongde, have been used by the capitalists. During the general strike, they suddenly declared their separation from the labor union and worked on their own, even trying their best to disrupt the strike. They have been enticed by the capitalists and do not hesitate to assist the evildoers. They only care about their own wealth and disregard the unemployed workers who have no food or clothing, as well as the suffering workers in the store. They are insane and cannot be more so. Such harmful horses, faithless and shameless people, are not tolerated by the labor community. In order to assist the pharmaceutical workers and for the sake of the future of the labor movement, the Association hereby solemnly warns these employees and hopes that the employees of the two drugstores will carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages and turn back to their senses. Otherwise, the tens of thousands of workers in Shanghai will vow not to coexist with these labor traitors. Do not blame us for not warning you in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Five Labor Unions Oppose Foreign Soldiers' Atrocities <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Willing to Be the Backup of the Business Workers' Union</p>
<p>The Shanghai Zhabei Water and Electricity and other five labor unions issued a declaration in support of the Business Workers' Union's protest against the atrocities of French sailors: We read the report on April 2nd that the Business Workers' Union has filed a complaint with all sectors of society regarding the French sailors' willful atrocities and harm to compatriots, and we are shocked. In the past few days, we have repeatedly seen declarations from party departments at all levels and groups at all levels, listing vows to be the backup of the Business Workers' Union and vows to fight against imperialism, which shows that the blood of our people has not died out. Since modern times, the people have been deeply engraved in their minds the severity of the iron heel of imperialism. Since this case occurred, all sectors of society have spoken about it in detail. The reason why imperialists dare to kill and injure arbitrarily and without scruples is nothing more than relying on the concessions. Therefore, if the people of the country want to live and work in peace and have a thorough solution to the glory of the national system, they must assist the government in recovering the concessions. Otherwise, it is true that the declaration of the seven labor unions wants the chance to avoid tragedy, such as climbing a tree to catch fish. The imperialists have been so arrogant that they are like chewing wax. If you want to correct it, you must destroy the power of the overbearing. Extraterritoriality is also a tool for inverting right and wrong. Read the records of the 13th Pacific Conference on the Recovery and Abolition of Concessions, etc. The representatives at the meeting expressed their sympathy, but the main point of their attention was that the judiciary should focus on the safety of foreigners. I am glad that the sacred justice still exists in the world. However, before the ink of the records of the world conference was dry, the French sailors suddenly murdered people for no reason. Are foreigners with good justice, the safety of our Chinese people, even if they are not worth taking care of? Or is the safety of foreigners more valuable? Now that an over-the-boundary scope has been created, those who go will be warned. After this, it will be unimaginable. I hope that all our compatriots will rise up together and not stop until the purpose of recovering the concessions is achieved. In addition to leading all the workers to be the backup of the Business Workers' Union, these associations hereby declare: Zhabei Water and Electricity Labor Union, China and Foreign Cloth Industry Workers' Union, Steamboat Wood Industry Workers' Union, Su Ning Tea and Food Workers' Union, Zhabei District Cotton Weaving Industry Workers' Union.</p>

<p>Trial Procedure Issues Arise</p>
<p>Resolution Needed Before Proceeding</p>
<p>On the morning of the 8th, Chinese and Western detectives from the Laozao Police Station arrested four students from other provinces, Liu Zhiye, Wang Kuo-chih, Yan Jen-min, and Chen Ho-ching, at the Ningpo Native Place Association on Tibet Road for possessing reactionary leaflets. Subsequently, more people tried to enter the Beijing Grand Theater on Beijing Road and were arrested, including three workers, Tan Chen-chang, Cheng Lu-hsi, and Chen San-tai. At the time, Chang Chen-cheng was arrested for taking pictures of Liu Yi-ching, who was shot and killed during the disturbance. In the afternoon of the same day, Chen Mo-ke, also known as Chen Chung-hao, was found in possession of reactionary leaflets on Metherest Road by the Gordon Road Police Station and was arrested. All were transferred to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for preliminary interrogation the next day, and an order was issued to detain them for further interrogation. The case was originally scheduled to continue yesterday morning, so the Laozao and Gordon Road Police Stations summoned witnesses and escorted Liu Zhiye and the other nine people to the waiting room of the Second Court of the High Court at around 9:00 AM. The Chinese and Western detectives in charge of the case also brought all the leaflets they had seized. The leaflets were almost all colors, red and green, and were quite eye-catching. Half an hour later, Criminal Judge Song Yuan appeared and ordered the defendants to be brought forward. Lawyer Bo Liang, who represented the police station in the prosecution, was about to stand up and make a statement when Judge Song declared that the case had been scheduled for trial today, but a trial procedure issue has now arisen, so it cannot proceed today. It must be resolved before the trial can begin. After the announcement, he amended the case docket to postpone the trial and ordered the police to escort the defendants back to the police station for detention.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Young Man Hurrying with Paper <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Searched Because He Was Suspicious</p>
<p>Turned Out to Be Reactionary Propaganda</p>
<p>Hua Sheng, a Western detective from the Gordon Road Police Station, was passing Haifang Road at 6:30 AM on the morning of the previous day when he saw a young man carrying a bundle of paper, hurrying from east to west. Hua Sheng suspected something was wrong and stopped him for inspection. It turned out that the paper he was carrying was all reactionary propaganda. He was taken back to the police station. Under questioning, he said his name was Wan Chun-yu, 26 years old, from Wuhu, Anhui, and lived in a straw hut on Singapore Road. The detective immediately ordered a Chinese detective to accompany Wan to his residence to search it. Although they searched according to the address provided, they could not find anything. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, he was prosecuted in the High Court for counter-revolutionary crimes. Judge Song opened a court for preliminary hearing. Police lawyer Bo Liang stated the case, and Detective Hua Sheng reported the circumstances of the defendant's arrest. Judge Song first asked him his name, age, and place of origin, and then asked him about the origin of the leaflets. Wan Chun-yu confessed that the leaflets were given to him by a fellow villager, Hu Ming-xing, the day before yesterday afternoon and instructed him to send them to the entrance of the Cade Road Cinema at 6:00 AM yesterday morning and hand them over to a person wearing a velvet hat and holding a silk handkerchief. Therefore, he sent them yesterday morning, but when he arrived at the entrance of the cinema, there was no one like Hu said, so he had to carry the leaflets back and was arrested on the way. He met Hu Ming-xing at Qunzhi University last year. After obtaining the confession, Judge Song ordered the defendant to be detained for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Ended inconclusively</p>
<p>All Not Accepted</p>
<p>Novelist Xiang Kairan (i.e., the Unworthy Student) was rumored to have died last year, so the Masses Bookstore printed the words "Posthumous Works of the Unworthy Student" on the advertisement of the National Skills Grand View book published by the company. Xiang Kairan then hired a lawyer to sue Fang Dongliang and Jiang Xia-hun of the Masses Bookstore. The former Provisional Court once held a hearing, which has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, it was time for another hearing. Judge Sun Yuan of the Special Zone District Court took the seat. The plaintiff Xiang Kairan and his lawyer did not appear in court. Defendant lawyer Zhang Chongding then presented Xiang Kairan's original manuscript, bills, advertisements, etc., proving that the National Skills Grand View book was indeed written by Xiang Kairan and was not a fake. As for the rumor that Xiang Kairan had died, all the tabloids at the time had records. At this point, he submitted the Crystal News, etc. for inspection. After inspecting it, Judge Sun said that Lawyer Zhang had raised a counterclaim in the previous court hearing, suing Xiang Kairan for fraud and false accusation. Now that the part of the lawsuit has been clarified, whether to continue pursuing the counterclaim. Lawyer Zhang listened and consulted with the defendant. At first, he did not agree to close the case, but after Lawyer Zhang's persuasion, he agreed to withdraw the counterclaim. Judge Sun then ruled that the plaintiff in this case had not appeared in court after being formally summoned, nor had he appointed a lawyer to appear on his behalf. According to the Criminal Procedure Law, it should be regarded as a withdrawal of the lawsuit. It is announced that this case will not be accepted. Regarding the counterclaim, according to the lawyer's application to withdraw it in the presence of the defendant, and the defendant has no objection, it should also be approved and announced that it will not be accepted.</p>

<p>The Shandong Native Place Association previously hired a lawyer as a representative to sue the Shandong Guild Hall in the French Concession court for refusing to allow the use of the guild hall building. The court approved the plaintiff's use of the guild hall building. Yesterday, the plaintiff's lawyer was summoned again, stating that after the court order, the defendants still refused to allow the plaintiff to move in and work, and requested the court to enforce the order. The defendant, the Shandong Guild Hall, also had a lawyer defending, stating that there were regulations for borrowing the guild hall premises. The regulations were presented for review, stating that if the plaintiff wanted to borrow the guild hall premises, they must abide by the rules before borrowing. The plaintiff's lawyer also stated that the use and borrowing were different. The current court order was for use, not borrowing, and requested clarification.

<p>French Concession Tram Self-Combusts</p>
<p>电箱冒烟延烧木板 (Electrical Box Smokes, Flames Spread to Wooden Planks)</p>
<p>三十余辆四十分钟 (More Than Thirty Vehicles for Forty Minutes)</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 12:30, French Concession tram F-112 on Route 10 from Lujiawan, while passing in front of the Enpaiya Cinema at Eight Immortals Bridge, suddenly had faint smoke coming from the electrical box under the first-class section in the rear. The driver initially did not notice and continued to drive forward. However, when passing the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Amiral Bayle, the smoke became thick and with a loud bang, flames erupted, instantly spreading to the wooden planks inside the tram, turning them to ashes. The driver quickly stopped the tram, turned off the electricity, and pulled down the conductive iron rod on the roof. However, the fire continued to burn, so he telegraphed the company, which immediately dispatched several Chinese and foreign workers to remove the burning electrical box and douse it with cold water. The fire was extinguished after an hour. Tram F-117 on Route 2 from Xujiahui was then ordered to use the tracks on either side to tow the damaged tram back to the Lujiawan company for repairs. Fortunately, when the fire broke out, there were few passengers in the first-class section, and they all jumped out of the windows. There were more passengers in the third-class section, and they scrambled to escape, causing a great commotion and disorder. More than thirty trams were blocked and stopped, stretching from Rue du Consulat and Xinxiao Bridge to Avenue Joffre and Rue Tenant de la Tour, causing traffic to stop for forty minutes before resuming.</p>

<p>在汉又提回一盗 (Another Thief Brought Back from Hankou)</p>
<p>Fu A-Quan from Suzhou was also one of the thieves involved in the robbery of the Four Banks Reserve Vault of a large amount of currency. The Detective Feng Zhiming, Patrolman Bao Chengyu, Pang Yutang, and others from the Zhabei Police Station learned that the thief had fled to Hankou. They applied to the Special District Local Court, prepared an official letter, and went to Hanzhao to work with the local Public Security Bureau to arrest Fu A-Quan in Room 101 of the Pacific Hotel on Zhongshan Road in Hankou City. Of the stolen silver dollars the thief received, after spending some, there were still 1,170 yuan in banknotes from the Commercial Bank of China. The detectives boarded a riverboat and brought him back to Shanghai, arriving at the pier at 9:30 the night before. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Special District Court, where Judge Xu Jiashi opened the court for interrogation, and Chief Prosecutor Zhou also attended to perform his duties. First, Detective Feng reported the situation of the extradition from Hankou and the recovered stolen money. The Hankou Public Security Bureau temporarily detained the money because the documents from this side did not mention it, and planned to offer a reward from the money because of the 300 yuan reward for the arrest of the defendant. The remaining money was requested to be transferred to the case by writing another letter. Fu A-Quan confessed that he conspired with his brother Chen Ziqing to rob the bank's remittance, but he did not personally go to rob. Afterwards, Chen gave him 1,200 yuan, and when he heard that Yuan Genfa and others had been arrested, he fled to Hankou. Judge Xu approved the police station's request, ordered the defendant to be detained, and rescheduled the hearing to be combined with other cases.</p>

<p>郑良斌盗卖轮船被扣 (Zheng Liangbin Detained for Stealing and Selling a Steamer)</p>
<p>Shanghai Hengping Company purchased the Fusheng steamer from Jardine Matheson in May of last year, renamed it Dazhen, and entrusted Jiaoyi Shipping Company to handle cargo solicitation and customs declaration matters. Recently, Zheng Liangbin, the shipping director of Jiaoyi Company, falsely claimed to be the owner of the steamer, stole and sold the steamer to someone named Gao, renamed it Antong, and planned to apply to the Ministry of Transportation for a license. Hengping Company discovered this, reported it to the Shanghai Shipping Association, and the chairman of the association, Yu Qiaqing, telegraphed the Ministry of Transportation to stop issuing the license and wrote to the Jianghai Customs Supervision Office to stop issuing the ship's license. At the same time, Ossen and Shan Yuhua, two lawyers, were hired to sue Zheng for stealing and selling the steamer in the Special District Local Court. However, after Hengping purchased the steamer, it was mortgaged to Yixing Qianzhuang, and the Qianzhuang had creditor rights to the Dazhen. Now that Zheng had stolen and sold it, Yixing also jointly sued with Hengping. They learned that the ship was currently docked outside the dock of the Hefeng Shipyard in Pudong and requested the court to issue a warrant to arrest the defendant and bring him to court for interrogation, and to impose a provisional attachment on the ship. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge Zhitan opened the court. Because the defendant Zheng Liangbin had not yet been arrested, the plaintiff's lawyer briefly stated the facts of the case. Judge Ge then ordered the defendant to be arrested for further questioning.</p>

<p>砖船撞坏垃圾船 (Brick Boat Damages Garbage Boat)</p>
<p>Wu Erxizi, a garbage boat owner, after unloading two boats of garbage at Longhua Mouth around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, hired the Yongde steamboat of Futai Company to tow the two empty boats north. When they reached the Pudong Bailianjing area, they encountered Wang Cai, a woman from Yancheng, sailing a boat loaded with green bricks from the Pudong side, veering towards Puxi and sailing horizontally. Zhao A-di, the captain of the steamboat, quickly pulled the horn and instructed them to give way, but the brick boat still sped straight ahead, causing a large hole in the empty garbage boat towed behind the steamboat. The boat immediately started leaking water. Xue Jinzhong, a member of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's water patrol team, encountered this while patrolling the river. Recognizing it as a boat collision, he arrested Wang. Just as he was about to take her back to the team, her crew members, Wang Jinyin and others, came out and acted barbarically, refusing to obey and attempting to flee. Xu, the team leader, heard about it and immediately dispatched Inspector Li Chenghua, leading Patrolman Wu Minshen, Team Member Zhang Maosen, and others on a speedboat to intercept and detain the cargo ship, along with Wang, her crew members Wang Jinyin and Wang Yuanfu, and the victim Wu Erxizi, and brought them back together. The team leader ordered them to be brought to a preliminary hearing, and then ordered them to be temporarily detained separately, instructing them to investigate and then review the matter.</p>

<p>啜粥奇遇失踪妻 (An Unexpected Encounter with a Missing Wife While Sipping Porridge)</p>
<p>徐光来之一忧一喜 (One Worry and One Joy of Xu Guanglai)</p>
<p>Xu Guanglai, a Yancheng native living at No. 16 Tongji Road, Zhabei, makes a living by pushing a cart. His wife, Sun, is 23 years old and still quite beautiful. They have been married for several years and she has always been well-behaved. However, recently, she felt that her husband's income was too meager and she was often short of food. Unwilling to live in poverty, she became intimately acquainted with Xing Baoyu, a Funing native who trades in used goods. Xing has no wife and finds her young and beautiful, so he wants to take her as his wife. He gives her all the money he earns every day and coaxes her with sweet words, wanting to persuade her to run away with him. Sun is indecisive and her relationship with Xing is extremely close. When Xu is on the night shift, she often summons Xing to their home for secret meetings. Initially, Xu did not know. Last month, Xu passed by his home while pulling his cart and stopped by to see her, only to find his wife sleeping with a man in an intimate embrace. However, due to financial constraints, he pretended to be deaf and dumb and gently advised her, hoping that she would improve. But Sun did not repent. On the 18th of last month, Xu planned to take her back to their hometown. Unexpectedly, while passing the North Railway Station, she suddenly went missing. It turned out that Xing was waiting in the middle, and taking advantage of Xu's unpreparedness, she hired a rickshaw and went elsewhere. By the time Xu noticed, his wife was gone. He returned to his original place, crestfallen, and searched for her every day. Yesterday, he happened to pass Tongji Road, and because he was hungry, he went to a porridge shop to eat. Unexpectedly, his wife and Xing were also eating porridge there. He secretly reported it to the police, who arrested them and took them to the Second Precinct of the Fourth District. The case involves adultery and abduction, and they were ordered to be sent to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>沈元生米船遭湖匪劫 (Shen Yuansheng's Rice Boat Robbed by Lake Bandits)</p>
<p>Shen Yuansheng, a boatman, was hired by a Shanghai rice merchant, Wu, to load 180 piculs of white rice in Wujiang and transport it to Shanghai. On the 8th of this month, Shen's boat sailed near the Guanyin Temple in Dianshan Lake. There, three or four bandit boats were anchored. Seeing Shen's boat approaching, they forced it to stop about a mile away. They fired several shots, injuring the crew and piercing the hull. The crew members panicked and had to stop. The bandits, carrying weapons, boarded the boat, extremely angry. They beat Shen and looted everything. They opened the cargo hold, saw the rice, and ordered Shen's boat to sail, with two bandit boats escorting it behind, heading towards Dianshan Lake. In the evening, they docked on the shore of Tai Lake, with Shen's boat in the middle, monitored by two bandit boats on either side. At midnight, they forced the crew to row on the bandit boats. The crew took advantage of the bandits' sleep, jumped ashore, and fled to safety. The next day, they took a small boat to Wujiang to report the incident. Yesterday, Shen's crew came to Shanghai and told Wu about the bandit robbery. Wu is trying to rescue the ship and has asked the water police to suppress the bandits. It is reported that several boats have been robbed by bandits and their ships have been looted in the Dianshan Lake and Tai Lake area recently, so everyone is vigilant and dare not transport goods through Tai Lake alone.</p>

<p>兄弟捉将官裏去 (Brothers Arrested and Taken to the Authorities)</p>
<p>Wang Shuming, a Yangzhou native living at No. 20 Chongfu Lane, Taiyangmiao Road, Zhabei, makes a living by pulling a rickshaw. His wife, Zhou, is 28 years old and works in a silk factory. The couple's relationship is not good and they often quarrel. Wang resentfully abandoned her. Zhou, relying on her own labor, had an affair with Li Changlin, a clothing maker from Funing, and often did not return home for days. Wang's older brother, Shugao, believed that his brother's wife's adultery was a disgrace to the family, so he confined Zhou in a room the day before, locked her with iron chains, did not provide her with food and drink, and often whipped her. Zhou could not bear it and shouted for help in the street. The police officer on duty heard it, went upstairs to check, and found her mentally exhausted and haggard. He immediately took her to the General Office of the Fourth District, learned the details, and ordered the police to arrest Wang Shugao and Li Changlin. After questioning them, he determined that the case involved criminal matters and sent them to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Guo Xiaofu, an apprentice at the Huaming Mirror Factory on the Jilu Neighborly Lane in Shanghai County, which is owned by Huang Shengxiang and uses electricity to manufacture mirrors, died tragically. The factory is equipped with a motor engine and the business is thriving. The day before yesterday afternoon, Guo Xiaofu, also known as Guo Gaozi, a Jiangbei native who is 17 years old, was working on the machine, and carelessly crushed his head into the belt while transporting mirrors. He cried for help. Those in the factory saw this and immediately stopped the machine, but his skull had already been crushed, with blood and flesh all over the place, a terrible sight to behold. Guo was dying. The factory owner hired a car to take him to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment, but it was too late. He died on the way. The body was taken to the Xiying Public Office in Niumudi. The police from the Second Precinct of the First District summoned factory owner Huang Shengxiang. After questioning, the station chief ordered him to wait for review. He also ordered the local headman to report to the local court for an autopsy.</p>

Yesterday, Tao Jinren, an employee of the post office, found out and reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Wang and Xu and put them in the police station to await investigation.</p>
<p>海味行加派会计师清理 (Seafood Store Appoints Additional Accountant for Liquidation)</p>
<p>Shareholders of the Yiji Seafood Store on Yanghang Street, Xiaodongmen in the French Concession, Liu Mingshan, Liu Dusheng, Liu Yusheng, and Liu Qingchu, jointly hired a lawyer to announce liquidation. Fang Shunyuan, a shareholder and manager of the store, came out to object and hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the French Concession Court. Yesterday, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that due to internal disputes in the Yiji Store, shareholders Liu Mingshan and others declared self-liquidation through a lawyer without the plaintiff's consent. The plaintiff did not object to the liquidation, but insisted that the court appoint another accountant to liquidate the store. The plaintiff strongly opposed the defendant's lawyer conducting the liquidation. The lawyer representing the defendant stated that the plaintiff was a shareholder and manager of the Yiji Store and that the store was completely used by the plaintiff alone to engage in speculative activities outside the store, resulting in losses of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, which made it impossible to maintain the store. The defendants held a meeting to discuss, but the plaintiff refused to attend. Therefore, they had no choice but to temporarily appoint Liu Qingchu as the manager and hire their lawyer to liquidate the accounts, which was not inappropriate. Judge Gong Cheng approved the appointment of accountant Wu Ji to liquidate the accounts together with the lawyers from both parties and then review the matter for a decision.</p>
<p>船伙无辜被累 (Crew Members Unjustly Implicated)</p>
<p>吴淞商会设法营救 (Wusong Chamber of Commerce Seeks Rescue)</p>
<p>Zhang Xuezhi, a 43-year-old native of Xuzhou, has been working as a boat driver in the Su-affiliated anti-smuggling camp for more than ten years. His wife, Zhang, is 35 years old and has two young sons and a daughter, all living in the Li family's residence in Wusong for more than ten years. In recent years, the political situation has changed and Zhang has retired. He used his money to buy a customs boat, hired four crew members, and specialized in transporting firewood, selling it to various ports along the Yangtze River to make a small profit to support his family. Unexpectedly, at the end of October last year, Zhang's boat docked at the Liuhe Liumenjing port. Because the area is under the jurisdiction of Taicang County and theft cases have occurred repeatedly, the Floating Bridge Defense Corps mistakenly identified them as bandits. The boat and Zhang and the four crew members were sent to the Taicang County Government for questioning. Crew members Sun Shouhong and Wang Yulan were found to have committed crimes in the mainland and were sentenced to imprisonment by the county government. Zhang and the other two crew members have not yet been questioned clearly and have been detained in the county detention center for several months. After the incident, Zhang's family did not know the truth and, seeing that Zhang's boat had not returned for a long time, initially suspected that the boat had been overturned by the wind or robbed on the way. They sent people to search in all directions, but found nothing. Until the day before yesterday, they learned the truth. The Xuzhou-affiliated Shi Hu Native Place Association believed that they were indeed operating commercial ships and were law-abiding citizens. Because they mistakenly hired criminals as crew members, they were implicated and their families were helpless and extremely distressed. The association sent representatives, along with Zhang's wife and children, to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning to appeal, requesting the chamber to send a letter to the Taicang County Government to prove Zhang's innocence and release him to reunite with his family. Zheng Shushan, the chairman of the chamber, sent staff to investigate with various merchants in Wusong who had dealings with Zhang, and confirmed that he was a law-abiding citizen. He has already provided proof to the Taicang County Government and is seeking rescue.</p>

<p>Shen Sujing (also known as Suqin), a 17-year-old local woman, lives at No. 85 Zixia Road, outside Dadongmen in Nanshi. Because of her fair complexion, people call her "White Girl." She has a romantic nature and was once a movie star, so the nickname "White Girl" is well-known in the area. Last year, she met Shi Axing, a 20-year-old Ningbo native who makes clothing at No. 33 Matianxing Lane, and they fell in love. Shi is poor, but because he loves Suqin, he gives all his wages and even pawns his fur coat to buy her clothes and various ornaments to please her. The couple's love is growing stronger. However, the woman is fickle and soon has other lovers, neglecting Shi. Yesterday afternoon at around 2:00 PM, Shi happened to see her at the Popular Cinema in Xiaonanmen. He called out her nickname, "White Girl," but she ignored him and glared at him. Shi was unable to vent his anger, so he dragged the White Girl out and punched her, knocking her to the ground. The woman's face was covered in mud. In an instant, the White Girl became a Black Girl. During the commotion, Sun Yunhe, the police officer on duty at the Second Post of the District, heard about it and came to arrest the man and woman, taking them to the Third Precinct of the First District for interrogation.</p>

I was pleased to visit your esteemed hospital last week and was graciously shown around by you and your colleagues, which brought me great joy. I learned that you have built a great new institution with limited financial resources. Your superior intelligence is admirable. Although the hospital buildings are mostly old, they are well-arranged and coordinated. Your hard work is commendable. Furthermore, I observed that the organization of each department is precise, the examinations are thorough, and the treatments are complete, which greatly benefits the people. This would not have been possible without your careful planning. I have reported the advantages of your hospital to the Municipal Council. I wish you a bright future and spring prosperity. Davis, Head of the Health Department of the Municipal Council, April 8."

While the two women were choosing new women's shoes, their arms were half-exposed, and Ms. Qian's slender fingers were adorned with a diamond ring, its brilliance dazzling. Ms. Chen's fingers were adorned with two diamond rings, which were even more glittering, attracting the attention of thieves. When the two women were leaving, two thieves suddenly approached them, both wearing blue cloth short shirts, speaking with Shanghai accents, and looking like local hooligans. They pointed two guns at the two young women's chests and ordered them to take off their diamond rings. The two women, forced to protect their lives, let them take away the three diamond rings, valued at 1,200 silver dollars.

The day before yesterday, the owner ordered him to clean the room. After finishing, the owner suddenly claimed that 40 silver dollars hidden in the room were lost and accused Ye of stealing it. He fired Ye from his job and ordered him to pack his bedding and leave. Yesterday, the owner asked Ye's original recommender to order Ye to go to the teahouse to discuss the matter. Ye was furious and did not know what to do. He went to Tianjin Road to find his friend Cai Zilin, a waiter at the Red Cross, to discuss how to deal with it. After learning about it, Cai took Ye on the Taikoo Company's shift ferry to Pudong, intending to inter</p>
<h3 id="e125">Further News on Wang Xiaoda's Kidnapping <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The circumstances of Wang Binyan's son, Xiaoda, being kidnapped on Xinmin Road in Zhabei were detailed in yesterday's newspaper. It is reported that Mr. Wang has been managing the Zhabei Defense Corps and military supplies since the Jiazi year (1924), as well as various local public welfare projects, having advanced over 100,000 yuan. Besides mortgaging his residence and private property in Tongde Lane to the National Bank, Guangdong Bank, Cunde Money Exchange, etc., for six to seventy thousand yuan, he still owes several tens of thousands of yuan to private lenders, paying no less than 10,000 yuan in interest annually. Over the years, due to raising funds for interest payments, the directors of various charitable organizations sold part of the Pei Jiaqiao property, originally purchased with the advanced funds, to offset the debt. Last year, as there were no more assets to offset, the banks and money exchanges intended to sue in court. However, Chen Bingqian and others, mindful of Mr. Wang's financial losses due to public service, intervened to mediate, thus preventing the lawsuit. His enthusiasm for charity and public welfare is deeply appreciated in the local community. Currently, besides Mr. Wang requesting the authorities to conduct a thorough investigation, there is no further news on the case.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Municipal Public Works Bureau Focuses on Rectifying Traffic <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau believes that traffic conditions in the city are becoming increasingly complex.

<p>The Municipal Public Security and Health Bureaus, recognizing that indoor coffins are scattered in open fields within the city, have been exposed for a long time, inevitably spreading foul air and posing a threat of epidemics. They have jointly discussed and decided on measures to ban such placements, notifying coffin owners to relocate the burials. They have also convened a meeting of charitable organizations to discuss ways to bury ownerless coffins on behalf of the deceased. After considering the situation, it was decided to start with the densely populated and commercially prosperous areas of the North and South Municipalities. The Tongren Fuyuan Hall and Pushan Villa charitable organizations were tasked with selecting burial sites. Other districts will be handled in sequence. It is now known that these organizations have already buried ownerless coffins, totaling 204 in the South Municipality and 290 in the North Municipality, for a total of 494. The remaining coffins that have not been relocated by their owners will continue to be the responsibility of these organizations for burial.</p>

<p>Zheng Hongnian Delivers a Welcoming Speech</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Yong, the owner and president of Feng Yong University in Liaoning, has led his students to participate in the National Games. Jinan University in this city, recognizing that both universities are renowned domestically for their excellence in sports, and also remembering that Jinan University’s student marching team was well received by Feng University during their visit to Liaoning last year, welcomed Mr. Feng and his students yesterday at 10:30 AM. The meeting was presided over by Mr. Zheng Hongnian, the president of Jinan University. In his welcoming speech, he stated that since the reform of Jinan University three years ago, there have been few welcoming events. This time, welcoming Mr. Feng is of great significance. Firstly, because of Mr. Feng's personality and family background, he could have occupied a very important position in local politics, or at least lived a life of wealth and honor. However, Mr. Feng focused on the most promising young people, painstakingly founding Feng Yong University. The eastern provinces are located between two major powers, and can only stand firm by restoring the national spirit. The fundamental way to restore the national spirit is through education. The Russian Kropotkin, a large landowner, diligently studied and wrote books, creating the philosophy of mutual aid, but Kropotkin's realization came after the age of fifty. Mr. Feng, at such a young age, already has such a thorough understanding. Secondly, because of Mr. Feng's arduous and outstanding spirit of running the school. Ten years ago, Yang Sisheng ran the Pudong Middle School in Shanghai, achieving excellent results. As for private universities, there was Chen Jiageng's Xiamen University, but even with Chen's vast wealth, he has recently requested government assistance. Only Mr. Feng, with his personal financial resources and energy, founded Feng Yong University, which has achieved the most success. Thirdly, because of Mr. Feng's spirit of armed defense of the country. When the Northeast Incident occurred last year, Mr. Feng led his students to organize an expeditionary army to resist the tyrannical Russians, personally going to the front line. His patriotic act was especially unique. Finally, he said that based on the sports achievements of the two universities, it can be jokingly said that in today's world, the only heroes are Gong and Cao. He hoped that the students of both universities would move from formal connections to a great spiritual unity. Then, Mr. Feng gave a speech, stating that he had many feelings about coming south this time. Today, he would only talk about the current situation and difficult circumstances in the Northeast. Few people in the country pay attention to the Northeast. The Northeast can be said to be in a state of sorrow and suffering. There is inevitably a gap between the central government and the local government, but in reality, the blame cannot be placed on the central government, nor can it be attributed to the local government. The ultimate responsibility still falls on the youth. If their thoughts, knowledge, physique are not sound, they cannot supervise internally or resist externally, and they are ashamed of the three Chinese characters. He hoped that all students would cultivate their character, work hard in science, and develop a true spirit, so as not to be left behind or corrupted, in order to consolidate the Northeast's frontier. His tone was extremely impassioned. He also said that after visiting Jinan University's various construction projects and teaching achievements, he would have a very good example to learn from when he returned to school. Later, teachers and students from both universities gave speeches and took photos in succession, ending with great joy. After the meeting, President Zheng Hongnian, in his private capacity, invited Mr. Feng and his students to a dinner at Hua'an. The basketball teams of the two universities also held a friendly match at the Sports Association.</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>A: Why did you take off your hat to that girl? Do you know her?</p>
<p>B: I don't know her. It's just that the hat I'm wearing is my brother's, and my brother is very friendly with her.</p>
<p>Teacher: Children, do you know what wind is?</p>
<p>All the elementary school students could not answer.</p>
<p>Teacher: What? Doesn't anyone know?</p>
<p>Student: I know. Wind is air running urgently because it has important business to attend to.</p>
<p>A: You come back late every night. What does your wife say?</p>
<p>B: The difficulty is not knowing what to say. Because I have to think of new tricks every day, creating something out of nothing. I'm really running out of ideas.</p>
<p>A: Your son is so naughty. Why don't you beat him up?</p>
<p>B: It's just that my radio often breaks down, and he's the only one who can fix it.</p>
<p>Wife A: My husband always rests comfortably every night when he gets home, I always tell him to lean in the armchair and put his feet on the fireplace.</p>
<p>Wife B: You clever devil. You must have something up your sleeve.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Scattered Notes Welcoming Special Envoy Chu <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Zi</p>
<p>Mr. Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, is skilled in boxing and has been working for the revolution for nearly thirty years. He is indeed an important figure in the party and the nation. This time, he was ordered to go to Belgium to attend the World Expo. He set sail on the fifth of this month. The weather was clear and calm at the start, and those who saw him off were a sea of people, making it quite a grand occasion. Therefore, I will record what I saw that day with my pen.</p>
<p>Parting Words from Important Figures and Fellow Townsmen: Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Industry and Commerce, Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, and Wang Xiaolai and more than ten others, as well as the Huzhou Fellow Townsmen Association, such as Qiu Shengnong, Lu Liankui, and Pan Yisheng, and dozens more, as well as Shao Rugong, the Secretary-General of the World Peace Association, gathered at the Baique Temple on Alabastine Road before dawn. There were more than twenty cars. Chen Shaolan, Su Xingheng, and others each held a send-off flag, hundreds of them, fluttering in the wind, tailing each other. The viewers along the way caused ten thousand people to empty their lanes. It was truly a grand sight.</p>
<p>Five-Colored Leaflets in the Flames Flew Across the Sky: Mr. Shao Rugong has a good relationship with Mr. Chu. He specially asked the art experts Sang Dongchen and Dai Jinsheng to make five hundred fireworks that produced light, which were lit along the way and soared into the clouds. The exploding Chinese and Western five-colored leaflets fluttered across the sky. Some fell into foreign warships, and the sailors picked them up and cheered. Because the leaflets contained phrases such as welcoming the Belgian Expo and long live all countries, they felt deep sympathy.</p>
<p>Mutual Responses Between a Million-Crack Firecracker and Military Bands: The Fellow Townsmen Association pre-purchased a million-crack firecracker, attached with a thousand skyrockets. When set off, the sound was like a string of pearls. The melodious military music enhanced the excitement.</p>
<p>The Default of the Pre-Chartered Launch: Shao Rugong sent Zhou Baozhi and Li Bingcheng, the staff of the Peace Association, to pre-charter two launches in order to tow the barges and carry the well-wishers to escort the departure. Unexpectedly, the pre-chartered launches did not arrive. It was already noon, and they were anxious. Just then, a Huzhou launch arrived at the port. Shao Rugong immediately called the launch boss and asked them not to turn off the engine temporarily, so they could tow the company boat of well-wishers and manage to catch up. Amidst the military music and flag shadows, they escorted Mr. Chu to board the boat and set sail. Mr. Chu took off his hat to say goodbye on the ship's rail. The waving of handkerchiefs and hats on the shore, as well as the applause, expressed a strong sincerity. It was truly an unprecedented event.</p>
<h3 id="e132">A Trip to Longhua <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Du Shaomei</p>
<p>In the third month of spring in Shanghai, men and women like to take trips to Longhua, for the peach blossoms are bright and the spring light is beautiful. On the fifth of this month, a former subordinate of my father, a certain Fang from the Material and Official Department, happened to come from Longhua, saying that the peach blossoms on the road were in full bloom. I happily took my younger sisters, Xiaomei and Youmei, to go with me. I also invited Mr. Wang Meiju, but he was unable to go due to other matters, which was a great pity. So, at two o'clock, I ordered the car to set off, with Fang as our guide. We went from Seymour Road to Jinji Bridge. In about a quarter of an hour, there were already many tourists by the bridge.</p>
<p>The Scenery Along the Way: Half a li away from Jinji Bridge is Jijiawan, Fang's house. Fang said that it would be better to stop here, otherwise it would be no different from clearing the way among the flowers. I agreed. So, we stopped the car. Fang was also worried that it would be difficult for us to walk, as I am sixteen years old, Xiaomei is eleven, and Youmei is only seven. We went to his house, and he served us tea. After a while, we walked out of Jijiawan onto Longhua Avenue. Along the way, children flew kites, and old and young picked wild greens. The elderly with yellow hair and the young with drooping hair were all enjoying themselves. Unexpectedly, we found a paradise in this bustling city.</p>
<p>The Great View from the Pagoda: There is a pagoda in Longhua, next to the Jingjing Temple. The temple is not large, but the incense is very popular. There are many tourists. The monks in the temple rely on this time of year. Youmei wanted to climb the pagoda. We climbed up the steps, which are very narrow. It is easy to go up, but difficult to go down. Leaning on the railing and looking into the distance, Fang said that the east of the pagoda is Pudong, the south is the Cement Factory, the west is New Longhua, and the north is the city of Shanghai. Xiaomei said that it is no different from the Chaoran Terrace. When we went down the pagoda, there was a child crying, because there were no railings on the stairs, and he was afraid of falling to his death.</p>
<p>The Flowers and Trees in the Wei Family Garden: After we were tired of visiting, we wanted to go home. Fang said that there is the Wei Family Garden here, which has very beautiful scenery. So, we entered a small bridge and went through a winding path to the garden. The garden is seventy acres in size, surrounded by a small stream. The flowers and grass are very lush, especially the pine trees, towering into the sky. There are many kinds of them. There are several graves in the garden, covered with pine trees, which is especially peculiar. There are also dozens of red maple trees, as tall as the buildings. It is truly a rare sight.</p>
<p>The Desires of the Local Elders: There are many peonies in the garden. When we entered the garden, a local villager in his fifties suddenly offered to guide us, emulating Mao Sui's self-recommendation. When he saw the peonies, he pointed to them as Chinese toon heads. There were also daffodils. Fang joked, "Is this leek?" Those who heard it laughed, and the villagers grumbled, meaning something else, like what the people of Hangzhou call peeling cucumbers, or what the people of Shanghai call knocking on the bamboo pole. I gave him four silver coins, and he thanked us and left. It was both pitiful and laughable.</p>
<p>Returning with Poems in the Setting Sun: After a while, the sun was setting in the west, and we were about to go home. We walked to Jijiawan, got into the car, and crossed the Jinji Bridge. There were even more tourists, similar to the scene at the ancient Gaoliang Bridge. So, I recorded it in a seven-character律詩 poem. The poem says: (Small note: car at Jinji Bridge, kites flying, wine flags fluttering. The incense has burned to the end, costing thousands of gold. The pagoda shadow soars high, like a jade strip. The willow color is green, and the spring color is transparent. The peach blossoms are bright, and the sun is beautiful. The silent lushness all contains smiles, as if sending the tourists home.) Xiaomei also has a poem: (The green willows are gentle, and the soft strands hang down. The peach blossoms are bright and beautiful. The seven levels of the pagoda reach the sky, silently making an appointment with Longhua for a later date.)</p>
<h3 id="e133">Wang Jiyuan's European Tour Farewell Painting Exhibition <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Qingkou</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jiyuan, a well-known artist in the art world, resigned from his teaching position at the Shanghai Art College in 1926, immersed himself in research, and traveled extensively. He has traveled to the East four times and visited scenic spots in the country, collecting painting materials. His art has made rapid progress. All kinds of oil paintings, crayon paintings, ink paintings, and watercolor paintings of human bodies, landscapes, and still life are exquisite and profound. We have already seen them at the National Art Exhibition and the first Art Garden Art Exhibition.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Wang will go to Europe at his own expense. His recent works from the past year will be on display at the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association on Tibet Road from the 11th to the 14th of this month as a memorial exhibition for his European tour. I drove over to see it one day before the opening, and I was greatly amazed. Mr. Wang's style is very different from the past, combining fineness and boldness. His boldness is like the galloping of ten thousand horses, and his movingness is like the night cry of a cuckoo, making people reluctant to leave the venue. This shows the depth of the art's appeal. I will record it when I return.</p>
<p>April 10th last year was the opening day of the National Art Exhibition. April 10th this year is the opening day of Mr. Wang's solo exhibition. Although there was thunder and lightning and heavy rain, the audience still went in the rain. I like his watercolor sketches and new country paintings of Lai the most. Most of them are his friends, such as the painters Chen Baoyi, Pan Yuliang, Chen Chengbo, Jin Qijing, Liu Yanren, Wang Dilang, Deng Fen, and Zhang Chenbo, as well as Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, Chen Bulei, a professor from Zhejiang, Zheng Echun, and celebrities such as Ye Yuhu. They have all marked Wang's works. The person in charge of the exhibition heard that pre-sale tickets had been sold in advance, so people competed to buy them, which is a good phenomenon for promoting new art.</p>
<p>Large-scale oil paintings, such as "Regret", "Mask", and "Seeing the Light Again", contain profound meaning. "Regret" depicts a naked woman wearing a silk robe, covering her forehead, turning her head upwards and looking back. The muscles are tense, with unspeakable secrets. It is indeed the largest and most moving work in the venue. "Mask" depicts the greed and vanity of human beings, who are enslaved by material things. A green mask covers their eyes, and their hands are wrapped in gold ornaments. They are interacting with two men in the background, which is a miniature of the dark society. It is probably the author's feelings. "Seeing the Light Again" seems to be a continuation of "Mask". It depicts a naked woman sitting by the window, bowing her head in repentance. Masks are discarded all over the ground, and she sees the light of the earth again. The purple-blue background contains infinite hope, which also shows the painter's hard work.</p>
<p>The small works, such as the sketches in Suzhou and Hangzhou, are even more brilliant. It is said that Mr. Wang can paint twenty paintings every morning and evening during his short journey, which can be said to be a divine skill. During this solo exhibition, art lovers should not miss it.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Preface to the Special Issue of the Completion Ceremony of the New Building of the Thai Chinese General Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Zhaoxin</p>
<p>What I saw in the South Seas: seven or eight out of ten people coming and going are Chinese. If you don't ask who the rulers are, you won't mistakenly think it's your hometown. The Chinese in Thailand are more numerous than elsewhere. The land in Thailand is vast and the population is sparse, so they want to recruit immigrants to fill it. They love the Chinese race, so they especially like the Chinese to come, settle down, enjoy their customs, and live and prosper. The Chinese in Thailand are therefore growing in size. Many are farmers, many are workers, and many are merchants. The greatness of the commercial organizations is also unmatched. Last summer, I resigned from my official position and traveled south. When I arrived in Bangkok, I saw the newly built Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. It was magnificent and beautiful. President Huang Qingxiu extended a piece of paper and a pen and asked me to write a plaque. When I said goodbye, I wrote the four characters "Never Forget the Motherland" to encourage him. Half a year after I returned to China, President Huang sent a letter to inform me of the completion ceremony and that a special issue would be published as a memorial. He asked me to write a preface. I heard that the ceremony was very grand. The King and Queen of Thailand and local celebrities and envoys from various countries all attended. The grandeur of the event can be imagined, and the elevated position of Chinese merchants can also be understood. However, these things are not necessary to say. What I want to say is the two ends of the nationality treaty. Nationality is the easiest to obtain and the most difficult to obtain. For the natives, there is a reason to go out. For example, Lu Tong had a son named Tianding, which means to add one ding to the country. This is the natural result of obtaining nationality. There are parents who are not citizens of the country, but their children are born in this land, and they can also be registered as citizens. This is the result of the principle of jus soli. There are those who are born abroad, but naturalize according to bloodline, and still obtain the nationality of their parents. This is the result of the principle of jus sanguinis. There are those who live in a certain place for many years, and obtain the nationality of their place of residence at their own request. This is the result of their will. As for those who are neither born in the land, nor naturalized according to bloodline, nor have lived there for many years, they naturally obtain nationality after the permission of legal procedures. This is truly rare in the world. It only exists in Thailand's treatment of Chinese people. Once a Chinese person enters Thailand, Thailand regards them as citizens. There are inherent reasons for this, but the number of gains and losses for us may be questionable. If we think it is a loss, it is like when Chinese people go to the United States. It is already difficult to enter the country, let alone become a citizen. Because people of the yellow race, except for those born in the country, cannot enjoy the rights of citizens. It is as easy to obtain Thai nationality as picking up grass. If we compare this example with theirs, how can we not accept it? If we think it is a gain, then one more Thai citizen is one less Chinese citizen. However, our country's nationality law states that for citizens who go to other countries and their children who are born elsewhere, if they have not formally renounced their nationality, they are still citizens of China if they return at any time. When Japanese people go abroad to make a living, their government protects them, and even helps them obtain the nationality of other countries for the convenience of business. It is true that a country's population is too large, so there must be a place to settle them. The gains and losses of nationality cannot be discussed in general. Therefore, it is permissible for our people to temporarily obtain Thai nationality. When they return, they will be Chinese citizens. However, it is a pity that the Sino-Thai treaty has not been concluded, our country has no permanent consul in Thailand, and overseas Chinese cannot receive adequate protection. In terms of geography, Thailand is in the same continent as us. In terms of history, Thailand was our former vassal. In terms of race, the Chinese in Thailand have grown and merged into one. In terms of commerce, Chinese overseas in the whole Thailand involved. There is a close relationship between China and Thailand. How can there be no treaty for a day? Thailand has treaties with Japan, which is in the same continent, and with the white colonial territories that are in the same continent, but it has no treaty with the largest independent country in the same continent. What is the reason? The conclusion of the Sino-Thai treaty has not been realized. They say that the reason is that there have been many accidents in China for many years. How can we know that we are negotiating to revise the equal treaties with various countries? However, they deliberately postpone it. What they mean is not to despise China, but to fear China. According to the previous saying, the great power cannot tolerate it. According to the latter saying, the Chinese race is peaceful, why bother too much? We believe that after the treaty is signed, the friendly relations between China and Thailand will be strengthened, and the difficult problems faced by overseas Chinese in Thailand will be solved easily. This is what the governments of both countries are praying for. The country is to the people as parents are to their children. Ascending high, we know the longing of the son for his parents. Leaning on the gate, we know the concern of the parents for their son. The country does not abandon its people, and the people do not forget their country. They are no different from each other. The further away they are, the stronger their centripetal force. The sincerity of overseas Chinese to love their country is evident. Chinese merchants in Thailand built a guild hall and call it "Chinese", not forgetting their roots. In one fell swoop, the spirit of respecting work, enjoying the community, and loving the country is revealed. In the absence of a treaty to protect them, the spirit and ability of self-government are especially unattainable. Alas, how admirable it is! Spring of the 19th year of the Republic of China. Zhu Zhaoxin of Huaxian prefaced.</p>

<p>Chapter Ten: Crimson Flames Soar, a Courtesan is Praised for Filial Piety; Red Carpet on the Ground, Meeting Famous Actors</p>
<p>Ruiyun and the others returned home. The eldest aunt said, "Oh dear, where did you go to see the play? There were several tickets with your name on them, requiring your personal presence. I asked the servants to help return them. They all said they couldn't find the place. What's this 'Moudeli' or whatever, opened in such an obscure location? We've lived in Shanghai for more than ten years, and we've only heard of Dan Gui, Tian Xian, and other teahouses. There's no such theater. One of the servants circled the main road several times but couldn't find it. I was scolding those good-for-nothings, wondering why they didn't send someone with you when you left earlier. They're just lazy. " Zuo Shichen secretly laughed upon hearing this, thinking, "Luckily, when we went, we didn't have Ruiyun take a chartered car. Otherwise, they would have been circling around trying to find Moudeli." But even if they had found the place, the doorkeeper wouldn't have let them in. Now that it's all over, there's no need to reveal it. Ruiyun was very happy that day. She actually got to comfortably watch the entire play from beginning to end without any interruptions, feeling very satisfied. At this moment, several younger sisters in the room wanted her to tell them everything about the play she had seen. Ruiyun put on airs and said, "This kind of play isn't like the old plays with gongs and drums in the old theaters, nor is it like the popular 'civilized plays' of today. It's a play that a group of students who studied in Japan wrote themselves when they felt like it. They only perform when they're in the mood. Even if you offered them tens of thousands of dollars, they wouldn't perform if they didn't feel like it." Fengyun said, "This is just another new play. It's not as good as the old plays. Old plays have singing. I like listening to the singing. Some of the old men sing really well." Then Fengyun began to hum "(I was originally) Wolonggang." Hanyun was about to listen to the story of the play and said, "Don't make noise. I know you can sing a few lines. If you want to be happy, you can sing a few more songs on stage tomorrow. Why did you argue with the huqin player and say he wasn't playing in tune?" Ruiyun then told them the name of the play, called "不如歸" (不如归; Buru Gui or "Better to Return Home"), which was a tragic play. In the later scenes, the Second Young Master said, "I'm going to cry." I said, "I never cry." Many people cry when they read novels and reach a sad part. I don't. But in the end, when it got to the sad part, I really did cry. Everyone in the theater, all the women, cried. Hanyun said, "If you're going to cry, then don't watch it." Ruiyun said, "The Second Young Master said the same thing, 'Let's go back.' But the more tragic it became, the more we wanted to watch it. It seemed like the more tragic it was, the more flavorful it became. It wasn't just us; no one in the whole theater wanted to leave." Just as she said that, they heard a lot of noise downstairs. Zuo Shichen said to Ruiyun, "What's going on? There's a lot of noise downstairs."</p>

<h3 id="e136">Finance: Gold Market Scene Confusing <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The trend showed strength but then weakened. Yesterday, the 12th, the gold market was confusing, with good mixed with bad, already showing chaos. Highs and lows changed suddenly, with a difference of three taels. The exchange rate continued to narrow by half a notch. The domestic market was slightly loose. The buying and selling among dealers varied greatly. Some firms, such as Yu Dafuchang Zhifengyong, etc., made purchases, while Yuan Mao, Yongsheng, Da, etc., all sold. Other firms were requesting and supplying intermittently. From the time the large amount of silver shrank in the morning market, it opened high, once exceeding 500 taels. However, due to strong selling pressure and an unstable situation, with reports of the Tokyo stock market closing, people became uneasy and the momentum turned weak. It quickly broke through the 500 tael mark, with a slight remaining reserve of one or two taels. At noon, the atmosphere was even worse and sellers were even more aggressive, falling to below 498 taels. The exchange rate weakened again. The Bank of Japan only bought a mere one tael and three and a half fen in forward gold. In the end, the trend seemed to ease, lingering around 99 taels. Later, because it was Saturday, the market closed as usual. British silver bars all shrank by .1875, and silver prices were also half lower.</p>
<p>Rising and falling intermittently, the May gold market finally closed flat. The opening price immediately increased by one tael and two mace to 500 taels and .005 qian. The gross price reached 500 taels and .006 qian. However, Wanxing, Shunli, Yuanmao, Yong, and others sold off, and although buyers were not negligent, the low exchange rates between Japan and the United States made people feel uneasy. When the first official rate was announced, it was around 98 taels, and the sale of 11 pence and .375 of British gold in Zhejiang in June caused it to fall to 7 taels and .89 qian. However, the official rate had already shrunk by .125, the US dollar by .25, and the Japanese yen added half a fen, then returned to several qian higher. The domestic market also stabilized. In June, banks mutually traded 11 pence and .375. Sumitomo bought forward Japanese yen at 103.5625, and recently at 104.5625. Also, the Bank of China and Zhengjin mutually traded recent British gold at 11 pence and .25, so the gold price continued to rise by five or six qian, amounting to 99 taels and 1 qian. After 10 o'clock, it turned lower again, due to the activity of various selling accounts. The supply on the floor exceeded the demand and the Japanese yen loosened. Mitsui bought one tael and .035 fen of August gold, people were quite uneasy, and it gradually dropped by one tael and several qian. At 11 o'clock, it suddenly fell to 97 taels and .4 qian. After this, the short sellers took advantage of this to purchase, adding up to 8 taels and .12 qian, and retreating to 7 taels and .78 qian at 11:30. Later, Zhifengyong and retail investors and others chased after it, and the Mitsui Bank absorbed the spot goods, with the price at 98 taels and a half, and then saw the peak again, reaching 99 taels and two or three qian at noon. Banks absorbed 11 pence and .4375 of July British gold, so July Japanese yen could be sold at one tael and .04 fen. By the time the market closed at noon, it was suppressed to 98 taels and 9 qian, only falling four qian compared to yesterday.</p>
<p>The closing price was 13 taels with half a qian. The largest price during the half day was 500 taels and .006 qian, and the smallest price was 497 taels and .4 qian, with a difference of three taels and two qian. The posted price had been changed to 511 taels and 8 qian. However, the official Japanese yen rate had already added half a fen. After initially pressing down to 13 taels and more in the morning, it was actually suppressed to more than 14 taels. The noon closing price was 13 taels, and the book entry was supplemented with 99 taels. The opening price of goods was 500 taels and .004 qian, and the noon closing price was 498 taels and .8 qian.</p>
<p>Transactions varied. Transactions from firms such as Yuanmao Yong, Sheng Da, Tianyu Yong, Jin Da Yong, Tai Xing, and Yuan Mao, Wan Xing, etc., all had sales. Heng Xing, Taifeng Cheng, Yuan Tai, Yuan Cheng Yong, Shun Li, and Yuan Yu Yong, etc., were in and out from time to time. Fuchang, Yuan Heng, Yu Da, Fu Yu, Tong Chang, and Fu Xing Yong, etc., had purchases. There were more hedging strips sold than bought, and few retail investors were in and out. The Dalian gang sold 1,000 strips and bought more than 700 strips. The other firms were like scalping traders, so it was rare to see over 1,000 strips.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Foreign Exchange Tight but Loosening <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Overseas silver prices contracted… HSBC's listed prices also narrowed by half a notch.</p>
<p>Transactions were not very smooth… Chinese merchants sold over one million Japanese yen. Yesterday, as usual on Saturday mornings, the British and American silver markets contracted, so HSBC's listed exchange rates were also narrowed by half a notch. British gold shrank by .125, to one shilling and eleven pence. The US dollar was reduced by .25, to 46 yuan and .625. The Indian rupee fell by .75, to 128 rupees flat. The French franc was slightly less than 7 yuan, to 1,190 yuan. The German mark was reduced by 1 yuan, to 195 marks. The Dutch guilder was slightly less than half a yuan, to 115 guilders and .75. The Singapore dollar added .75, to 121 taels. The Japanese yen added half a fen, to one tael and .06 fen. Hong Kong did not change, remaining at 80 taels. Also, the overseas market conditions: the Indian rupee remained at 54 rupees and .25. Yokohama and Kobe were slightly lower, and the market appeared soft. The domestic market for various exchanges in this port initially strengthened but later declined, appearing stable at noon. However, compared to the previous day, the shilling was longer by .0625, the US dollar added .125, and the Japanese yen decreased by .25, indicating a situation of apparent firmness but hidden weakness. This was due to the influence of the gold market turning from sharp to weak, hovering around 500 taels. People's hearts were unsettled, and Chinese speculators made some sales, but there were no large transactions. It was estimated that tens of thousands of pounds of British gold were sold, absorbed by Huabi and others, and Zhejiang Industrial also sold a small amount. Banks mutually traded 60,000 to 70,000 pounds. Also, only slightly over 100,000 yuan of US dollars were sold. As for the Japanese exchange, over one million yuan was sold, absorbed by Datong, Mitsui, Korea, Sumitomo, and Zhengjin. The market situation was still in a state of circling.</p>

<p>New York, April 11, reports on the cotton market situation for the week, stating that the recent market conditions are still the focus of attention for the cotton exchange. The weekly market tension shows slight signs of loosening, and selling often increases, as if there is not much confidence in the market price. However, it is rumored that the futures held by the cooperative in May and July are gradually decreasing, and the price differences between the months fluctuate greatly. However, the old cotton remains quite high. Many believe that the main long side is currently holding quite firmly, intending to take delivery. This matter is not yet determined, so the mood is uncertain, and general transactions are also slightly sluggish, as they are waiting for the development of the new cotton scene. The estimated decrease in cotton acreage ranges from 3% to 8%. Recently, the weather has been cloudy and the temperature has been low, causing the agricultural work in the eastern and central parts of the cotton belt to be delayed.

<p>Scarce Arrivals from the River... Local Sales Extremely Stagnant</p>
<p>White粳 Rice Falls Short by Two Jiao... 秈元 Rice Also Turns Weak</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, very few boats arrived from the river, practically none, and local sales were very sluggish, almost stagnant. However, accumulated stock is substantial, and sentiment is poor. Merchants, seeing the market's sluggishness, are eager to sell, but buyers are few. Though anxious, it's no use. Therefore, although Northern 粳 Rice fell short by two jiao on the market, transactions still didn't pick up. The sluggish sales are the real problem. Furthermore, the Social Bureau sent personnel to investigate and strictly limit the highest price to eighteen yuan. Later, because inland prices were high, and sales were inverted, a merchant association representative, Mr. Ye, mediated and presented the difficulties of the shippers, temporarily maintaining the status quo. Merchants are looking for other solutions. However, foreign rice frequently arrives in this area, and stores have abundant stock. Although no river boats have arrived in recent days, accumulated stock is still seventy or eighty percent. Therefore, 粳 Rice prices cannot rise again. 羊秈 Rice and 杜秈 Rice are also slightly lower now. Buying interest is quiet, and the situation is slack. Prices feel unstable. 白元 Rice, affected by the overall trend, has become weak.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: About ten boats arrived from the river. Sales in the market are still acceptable. 常錫 Northern 粳 Rice is stabilizing because high-quality rice is very scarce. Medium-grade rice is also not selling well. Buyers are selective, and the situation has become stable. 苏同粳 Rice is gradually decreasing because the route to market is similar to Northern Shanghai, but the base stock is thinner, so the price is slightly lower by a few jiao. 南帮 薄稻 Early Rice and 寗帮 Rice are slightly active. Street sales are also picking up. The morning is very active, but the afternoon turns sluggish due to the poor situation in Northern Shanghai. The top price is eighteen yuan, one or two jiao. Various 羊埠 秈 Rice varieties are stable because foreign rice is steadily performing well, and special sales are active in the overall market. 變元 Rice sales are weak. 陰元 Rice is scarce and sales are flat. The market has generally softened, and the situation feels lifeless.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Foreign Rice Sales Continue to Be Strong <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, sales of foreign rice were very good. The total market sold 13,000 to 14,000 bales, especially 小絞 Rice, which best suits customer tastes, accounting for sixty or seventy percent. The main routes are still to various gangs in Zhejiang Province and inland areas of this area. Small, very high-quality 小絞 Rice is priced at fourteen yuan, eight jiao, six fen. Second-grade Saigon Rice is fourteen yuan, eight jiao, seven fen. Large 絞 Rice is fourteen yuan, six jiao. First-grade Saigon Rice is fifteen yuan, five jiao. The rice market is generally in good shape. Only first-grade Saigon Rice, of which there are abundant arrivals and stocks, is selling less and the market is slightly slack. Futures trading totaled 2,600 tons, with more 小絞 Rice. Market prices are similar to previous market prices, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e149">The Flour Market is Unstable and Shaky <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was unstable for all months, especially April and May, where sentiment was even more weak. For this month, actual sales are not picking up, and the market has been sluggish for a long time. Daily sales from Tianjin are less than 30,000, and the current stock is still 1.5 to 1.6 million. There are also foreign flour orders yet to arrive, totaling over 2 million bales. Therefore, during the transition period, Tianjin will naturally not inquire. As for May, because the difference with June is too great, it can be maintained when sales are strong. However, people now seem to be considering this, believing that the inverted situation will be difficult to sustain for long. The lack of confidence and the dumping of stock are due to this. However, because manufacturers of far-term new flour are unwilling to try dumping and inland gangs are still firm in their thinking, the price drop is still small. Based on this situation, it is predicted that later steps will likely lead to near-term suppression and far-term equalization. As a result, this month fell by one fen compared to the previous day, June fell by one fen, two li, five hao, June small five li, July small two li, five hao, August small five li, September unchanged, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Wheat Spot and Futures Markets Are Both Flat <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market generally showed signs of stability for all months. For this month, the bulls and bears have largely reached an understanding, so there were few fluctuations. After the daily rise of new wheat in far-term months, sentiment has turned stable. However, this kind of new wheat price is already considered unusually expensive. If it were to be raised further, it would be too unrealistic. As a result, this month was higher by one fen compared to the previous day, June and July had no change, August was lower by one fen, and September was higher by one fen. The spot wheat market has become stable. There were rumors of a sudden and widespread surge a few days ago. Because local factories, seeing the purchasing by inland factories, intentionally raised prices to show resistance. Therefore, inland areas did not purchase, and the market became flat. Xuzhou wheat opened at five taels, one mace, eight fen. Nansuzhou wheat opened at five taels, one mace, eight fen. Bengbu wheat opened at five taels, one mace, eight fen. Shashi wheat opened at four taels, nine mace, two fen. Jiangxi wheat opened at four taels, nine mace, four or five fen, four taels, nine mace, two fen, four taels, nine mace, and four taels, eight mace, seven fen, for a total of 5,600 bales, purchased by local factories, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the soybean market was flat. Prices were slightly weak, and Shanghai sales were not strong. Spot prices were the same as the near-term standard, both opening at five taels, four mace, five fen. Local interest was not good, and inland gangs were especially ordinary. The situation is temporarily settled. There were customer inquiries for futures bean cakes. Far-term cakes were perceived to be slightly firm. June was lower, opening at one tael, eight mace, four fen.</p>

<p>Exchange Rate Turns Tight</p>
<p>Recently, the exchange rate has become firmer, and the US dollar has strengthened. At this time, the sale of Chinese silk to America has suddenly become smoother, and exports are increasingly smooth. Various American firms are very interested in the Shanghai factory products. However, the Shanghai stock of dried cocoons is limited, insufficient for silk reeling, and supply cannot meet demand. The attitude of the manufacturers is becoming firmer, and the market is becoming more attractive. Yesterday, 乾利 and others imported eighty bales of white factory silk into Shanghai. 伯興 imported eighteen bales of yellow reeling silk. Prices are becoming more firm, it is said.</p>
