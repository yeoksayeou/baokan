<h3 id="c3">各國證劵暴跌 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>美國之證劵。已有兩次之暴跌。德國市場因而亦受影響。今日本證劵。又以暴跌聞矣。繼之而起者。凡世界之大商業國。恐均不能免。蓋以今日商業之日益衰落。爲全世界事。而非一洲一國間事也。商業衰落證劵自然暴跌。其所以有先有後者。經濟組織之感覺。有靈敏與否。維持經濟之力量。有久暫之不同耳。而終則無一不普及也。</p>
<p>故以今日之世界情形言。無論其國之强與弱。皆有自顧不暇之勢。而其自顧不暇之原因。非自外來。皆由其自身成之。如欲補救。旣非可以用强力以相强。又非可以一朝一夕所能成功。商業之衰落。無法可以强人購買。失業工人之多。又無法可以强爲容納。因商業衰落而失業之人愈多。因商業衰落而國家之財政愈困。因國家之財政困。而失業之人更無從救濟。因此三種原因輾轉相生。而處置之道益窮。故曰今日世界各國。咸有自顧不暇之情形。也假使因失業問題無法救濟。而生擾亂。則商業之衰落益不能免。而世界亦因兹更多事矣。</p>

<p>主席演詞主席王曉籟致開會詞云、本會今天召集同業公會代表大會的理由、已在聲請市黨部市社會局許可内容詳細說了一遍、登在本埠報紙上、想各位都已見過了、但是今天開會秩序上、照例規定有開會辭一項、所以再來簡單地說一下、原來本會是去年五月奉令組織、照中央規定的組織大綱第十五條、有「商整會俟統一團體法令頒布後、統一團體組織成立時、即行撤銷、」等語、所以從這一點看來、本會就是統一商人團體的籌、備會、再簡單的說、就是「上海市商會」的籌備會、但是本會預定的整理期問、本來以爲幾個月或者半年、就可結束、爲什麽籌備到一年多久呢、這其中有幾個原因、第一點、中央頒布的法令、要經過多少的審查考慮的功夫、商會法於十八年八月十五日頒布、商會法施行細則、於十一月十三日頒布、工商同業公會法施行細則、於十九年一月七日頒布、而結束各地商民恊會之中央執行委員會命令、十九年二月十日、方始頒布、在中央未有統一商人團體的法令以前本會是無從著手進行的、第二點、要統一組織、先要把從前不統一的商人團體變更組織整理起來、整理的初步、就是登記、本市商人團體的登記、原來是一個創舉、所以初辦的時候、有些團體、簡直没有注意、把他當不一回事、有些團體呢、簡直隔膜誤會、所以不得已、就所登記的截止期限到十月底、第二步、就是整理、整理的意義、就是要把組織不合法變爲合法的組織、性質相同、依法應當歸併的、把地歸併起來、但是各業組織、都有其攸久的歷史、邦别的關係、從前是放任慣的、一旦依據中央頒布的法令、認眞實行起來、就不免有多少困難、所以儘有因爲改正一個公會的名稱、而各公會請求復議的公文、竟接續至三次四次、其餘應變更組織的、應依法歸併的、所經過的困難、自然更不消說了、幸賴中央曁本市黨政機關、主持提挈於上、而各業團體、亦能漸漸了解本會整理之眞實的意義、所以尚能於一年之内、完成籌備市商會的手續、一方面使本會有以仰副中央的使命、一方面依法爲商人團體的組織、把全國計算起來、上海仍舊是第一個成功、總算不辜負上海向來萬事先進的地位、本席應當代表本會全體委員、致其十分感謝的誠意、這一點就是本日開會的意思、</p>

<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>話、實使這四個字、係商人没有國家觀念的謬論、我們希望、將來商會成立後、起來多謀商人福利、發展工商事業、不過要謀工商業發展、第一點、應先維持原有工商業、現在皮皂火柴航業絲業綢緞業等、日漸凋敝、原有工商業、尚不能維持、那裏可以謀發展、所以要發展工商業、須先維持原有的事業、所以希望商會方面、應先注重、第二點、失業問題、今年藥業風潮、就是失業問題影響到各藥店不能開市營業、所以要發展工商業、應先解决失業問題、第三點、我國貧苦人占其多數、每年不到一百三十元的進欵者、至少有一萬萬人、因貧民生計關係、貨物不能儘量銷售、工商業即欲發展、亦無澈底解决辦法、第四點、時局不能和平統一、工商事業、也是不能發展、第五點、洋商經濟侵略、洋商在華發展商業、如銀行航業紗廠等、佔有上海最大勢力、中國商業、金融僅六萬萬元、洋商佔其半數、有以上五重原因、所以要打破工商業之難關、應有健全的組織、來協助政府、設法補救、如這五個問題、不能解决、我國工商業、問直是一條死路、從前商會一味接交官塲、置商業之發展於不顧、現在商會最重要的責任、在使能謀工商業之發展爲先决、</p>
<h3 id="c115">國府工商部市政府代表訓詞 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>方才、工商部代表趙晉卿先生去了、託兄弟代表、所以兄弟今天代表市政府、同時代表工商部、今天參加這個大會的、有各黨政機關、已經將很好高論說得很詳細、兄弟本可以不說話了、不過要怎樣發展中國工商業、陶同志已經說過的、兄弟尚有一點補充意思、貢獻諸位先生、要請諸位注意、陶同志說、中國的出路、只有發展工商業、要發展工商業、非把所舉的五個難關、完全打破不可、這種難關、怎樣能夠打破、就要曉得、天下事情、不用力下去、是没有結果、貪天之功、靠運氣的思想、今後完全要革去、要做到一種什麽事情、是要有一種什麽力量的、從前上海商會、負不起這個使命、最重大的原因、就是組織法不行、因爲從前商會、是以個人爲單位、某人入了商會、就是體面商人、大家只有個人、没有工商業、所以不能做事情、現在是以同業爲重心、商會是各個工商同業聯合的機關、是以工商業爲基礎的、這一點、應請大家明瞭、大家本身、都是會員代表、不是會員、剛才主席報告、上海所有團體一百七十個、現在合併爲商會、已經解决、此後共同去發展中國工商業、只要大家肯努力、全國的工商業、總可挽救、因爲上海是工商業最重要的地方、最有力量的地方、如果上海工商業者、能負起這個責任、全國自有辦法、陶同志所說不統一和平、也是發展工商業的障礙、這種障礙不解决、工商業也是不能發展、試問這樣打仗、怎麽樣去發展工商業呢、諸位知道、英國的工商業發達、是在什麽時候呢、是在「衣利沙伯」統一英國之後、英國在統一政府之下、工商事業、才能發達、他如德國是在普魯士成立了日爾曼聯邦之後、日本是在明治即位覆幕廢藩之後、可見世界各國、没有在一個不統一政府之下、能夠發展工商業的、現在天津的海關、被閻錫山弄了一個外國的流氓、去做稅務司國民政府對付的方法、是下令把天津海關封起來、這樣辦法、我們商家、就受了痛苦了、裝到天津去出口的貧、現在又要運轉來了、商家受了這個痛苦、不明事理的、必定埋怨南京政府、實在呢、是吃閻錫山的虧、又如内地土匪滋事、在國府範圍之内的、尚有辦法、倘在逆軍勢力範圍之内、就没有辦法了、所以我們要發展全國工商業、是要以整個力量去謀國家和平統一、不可如頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚、做敷衍苟且的工作、譬如現在閻馮逆軍、搗亂是靠錢、我們至少要斷絶他們的經濟供給、統一才有希望、統一有希望、才可以謀發展工商業、兄弟所補充陶同志的意思、就是要先統一政局、然後才可以發展工商業、所以要希望大家一致努力、促成統一、去發展工商業、同時並向到會諸君、有一報告、是商整會今日接國府文官處來電、派張市長代表國民政府到會致詞、張市長因公無暇、派兄弟前來出席、合併聲明、</p>
<p>全國商聯會代表致詞略謂、康侯今天、代表全國商會聯合會、出席參加、不勝榮幸、過去總商會是有甚光榮歷史於過去、且爲中國有商會之始、成立於前清光緒十七年、至今適爲三十年、但此卅年中、經過許多風潮、今日市商會成立、鄙人希望到會諸君、善爲振作精神、爲商業謀福利、最後一句話、即有上海商會、然後有全國商會聯合會、有全國商會聯合會、然後有商會法、應請各位注意云云</p>
<p>主席致閉會詞主席徐寄廎致閉會詞云、在黨的指導之下、商人有統一的組織、爲盛大的集會、不要說在本市是創舉、恐怕在全國亦是創舉、所以本日的大會、雖已終了、而其價值不可磨滅的、永遠值得吾們回憶的、更從另一方面觀察、今日會員大會的集會、即是商人新生命的開始、所以本席於現在將要散會的時候、一方面代表全體大會會員謹謝今日黨政機關及諸位來賓光臨指導的盛意、一方面還希望自今日起、全體會員、爲不斷的努力、時間匆促、不及多談、諸希鑒原、</p>

<p>駐紐約總領事館之報告</p>
<p>桐油爲我國特物、每年運銷國外、爲數甚巨、而以運銷美國者、其數尤多、但美國近對此業、提倡種植、努力宣傳鼓吹、期挽回其本國之利權、影響所及、實足危害我國桐油業之前途、工商部兹據駐紐約總領事館報告、我國桐油在美之現狀及前途、足資參考、已由部令上海商品檢騐局知照、並轉行本國桐油商人一體知照、兹節錄其原報告如左、甚願我國之營桐油業者、加以深切之注意也、</p>
<p>桐油銷美之情形桐油爲我國特産、近年運銷國外數額甚巨其大宗銷流之地實爲美國、每年居出口總數三分之二、按美國商部報告、最近三年來、我國桐油輸美之額每年約計增加一千餘萬磅、價值每年計增一百五十餘萬金元、實爲極可注意之事、</p>
<p>桐油在美之用途桐油在美國之用途、以製油漆爲最多、美國所製之地漆布油布等物、全恃桐油爲唯一之原料、美國之日用傢具無線電機汽車汽船上、無不需用桐油者、即種植之肥料、有時亦用之、而各工廠欲利賴之者尤要且巨也、</p>
<p>美國試植之成效美國鑒於桐油用途之廣大、與在實業上地位之重要、近年來在南部福勞利達省、試種桐樹成效頗著、且所産者質地較優、實足與我國桐油相抗、惟美國適於種植桐油之土地、僅該省一區所産亦僅能供給美東各省需要之一部份、美中美西各省所需求者、仍由我國供給、故近年我國桐油、輸美之數、仍有增無減、因此惹起該省種植家之注意、擬竭力推廣桐樹之種植、希望增中出産以抵制我國桐油之輸人、</p>
<p>商人提倡之熱心美國人有名柏蘭者、在該省米亞米城、組織一公司、專售桐子於該省居民、並在公司内設電影演講、指導種植桐樹之法、及獲利之方、在該埠報紙遍登廣告、作奇異之宣傳、以喚起美人之注意、柏蘭公司、近在該埠太陽報刋登廣告一頁、題爲「君欲使中國之夢想實現乎、」内容歷述中國五十年來壟斷世界桐油之出産與供給操縱美國實業、國人亟應打破中國之壟斷、努力種植桐樹、每晚七時半、有免費之電影、請聽關於桐油之特異演講云云用意至爲深切、</p>
<p>我國桐油在美之前途美國近數年來、在福勞利達省種植桐油、成績旣卓著、而油質又遠勝我國、益以商人愛國宣傳之烈、則今後美國桐油之出産、必更可驚人、現在美國尚以供給不足、勢不能不取求於我、將來遍植桐樹一旦得大宗之供給我國桐油、必難與之相競、爲預防計、我國應速從事改良桐油、增進質地、勸令油商從事大規模之製造、使其减輕成本、俾與美産競爭、</p>

<p>妻（和伊的丈夫反目）丨你這人簡直是世界只最無意識的人。我懊悔嫁給你的。</p>
<p>夫丨一些兒也不錯。但看我娶你爲妻。就是一個無意識的明證。</p>
<p>衣店顧客丨昨晚我來買這衫子時。你明明對我說是青色的。像一個青梅子的顔色一樣。怎麽今天一看。却是帶着黃色了。衣店夥友丨過了一夜。青梅子自然要漸漸地變黃了。</p>
<p>妻丨我自從嫁了你以後。從没有好好的吃過飯。只吃飽了一半。一半是挨着餓夫丨我們旣結爲夫婦。兩人就并爲一人了。我旣吃了一半。你自然也只能吃一半啊。</p>
<p>甲丨你怎麽把絲襪反穿了。</p>
<p>乙丨因爲那一面穿破了。開了一個窟窿。</p>
<p>甲丨昨天你在宴會中。怎麽老是和那面目可憎的婦人同在一起。始終没有分開。你這耐性兒。眞可使人佩服。乙丨只爲伊是我的妻子。</p>

<p>君試臨規模較大之工廠中去參觀。則每見有十指俱無。兩手如椎者。有僅具一臂者。有眇一目者。有跛一足者。此輩殘廢之徒。其工作能力。實不逮壯健者遠甚。然皆得任事其間。君若不知其底藴。將謂廠主具佛心腸。發大慈悲。而收容此輩。殊不知彼等之所以搆成此殘廢者。亦猶前敵健兒。效命疆塲。帶花歸來。旣罹斷肢折脰之慘。主其事者。乃不得不設法棲息之。以苟延其殘喘耳。士兵之於軍閥。小工之於廠主。志趣雖殊。其爲主而犧牲則一也。下走役於工廠有年。歷見斷指折臂之事。不下數十起。然從未有如日前所見者之慘也。爰紀其厓略。以告讀者。</p>
<p>有陳錦龍者。湘人。年已不惑。出身行伍。比以年老被黜。挈妻女來滬謀生。丐其鄕人介紹入紗廠工作。女十二歲。亦與之俱。父女二人。胼手胝足。月得工資。可念餘元。妻司炊洗。三人苦度。凍餒固無憂也。如是約歷二月。詎一昨之夕。值夜工時。錦龍偕其女進午夜膳後。其所值之打皮棍花機。機上皮帶落下。彼乃貿然取一扶梯。靠於原動處之地軸上。手攀皮帶。欲圖轉上於皮輪。詎用力過猛。梯又無人扶助。遂致梯一滑傾。手乃齊臂軋入皮輪然而斷。其人墮地而暈。手則掛於皮帶盤上。隨地軸而轉。血花四濺、慘不忍覩。同工者聞聲趨視。莫不驚呼。迨管理人至。急畀下。送之於滬東醫院。途次忽蘇。慘謂送者曰。請若速以手槍擊吾腦而死。此痛澈心骨之傷。實難再忍也。抵院經醫診視則謂傷已垂危矣。延至侵晨五時許遂畢命於院。其妻固尚在夢中也。余於六時進廠。同事舉以告余如上。並見軋下之臂以報紙裹之。血肉糢糊。不忍逼視。爲之不怡者累日。旣爲捕房所知。乃舁屍於斐倫路檢騐。經法官判令廠方。撫恤三百元了案。翌日見其妻與女兒。科頭麻服。來廠領恤欵。雙目腫脹。乃如胡桃。聞死者鄕中。尚有七旬之老母</p>

<p>數日前。客有詢吾近日内金價最高須至幾許者。時吾方披閱報紙。見有免費注射六○六一節。即信口答以六百○六兩。不意翌晨開市後。最高竟至六百○六兩。價格即疾趨下游。客亦於斯時左右售出十四條。午刻并餉我大菜一頓。飽餐之後。稱吾爲神。比吾告以所以。始啞然失笑。斯眞觸機之靈者矣。紀文達公所謂氣機偶動。鬼神憑之者觀乎此而益信。（却酬）</p>
<p>云。嗚乎。禍生不測。可謂極人間之慘矣。可知機械之學。非習之有素。知其搆造者。不可貿然動手。否則。殘廢喪生之事。終難免也。余嘗以此理詔示工人。然無知之徒。猶不時演其慘劇。誠無可如何也。</p>
<h3 id="c171">異軍突起的關紫蘭女士個展世琯 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>最近上海藝術界中。似乎很少有西畫展覽會出現。而個展却是更不一見。藝術的空氣。幾乎冷靜得非常了。突然間在華安八樓。其一個很值得注目的個人展覽會舉行。便是關紫蘭女士對於社會人士的一度供獻。女士對於畫的取材。實在有特殊的意味。在他人以爲是一個平淡而注意不到的地方。而伊却很能大膽地描寫起來。使人會感到驚奇。如何把這平淡的地方成了那樣美麗的去處了。在關女士的每一幅畫裏。部充滿了情感。幽冷如「西泠橋風景」「湖影」「池畔」等。也有豐富的情感在流露。正如一個小孩子靜靜地追思他慈和的姊姊。「後園」「亭外竹籬」二幅。更覺得深刻了。伊純用滿腔的情感。從腕下傳到畫上。使觀者一觸到眼簾。便會覺到一種輕快而蓬勃的生機。</p>
<p>朝門懸掛在第二室裏一幅大畫。題曰「聽琴」。我感到這是最有情感表現力最充足的作品。一個幼女張大着一雙晶瑩的眼。全神似乎在欣賞那彈琴的聲調。一隻狗。也仰起了脖子。表示它的主人微妙的心理。又有一個紅衣的孩子。也被這琴聲似睡歌般的使他天眞的小生命。得到無上的安慰。畫中的一切都被陶醉了。觀畫的彷彿聽到有美妙的琴聲。從弦上指上而發揚。因之也一同的被陶醉了。</p>
<p>但是有一點。我微微覺得有些不滿意。就是關女士對於光線没有顯著的分别。衣服和花瓶花樹幹等。都好像一個平面的東西。不過這並不能妨害伊那偉大的描寫力的表現。也不能因了不分光暗。便說伊的畫面有了缺陷。或者這在伊是有一種特殊的意味的。</p>
<p>總之僅在這六七十幅的作品中。我們很可以明瞭關女士的藝術天才是如何的偉大。又當驚異伊會那樣顯示伊内心埋藏的情感。衝破了海上最近藝術界的沉寂。</p>

<p>博士掃地之說。愚謂不能罪之梅氏。愚足跡不出國門。未知西洋學府之湛深。然知孜孜卒業。論文及第之人。亦未必盡有造於邦國。至名譽贈送。在施者不過致傾倒之私。在受者寗必有名器之分。必欲程其實學。則自徐菊人以及上海約翰大學所致贈之諸公。其造詣如何。當亦胡盧而自哂。又何必咎之梅氏。且梅氏本不因此以致名。社會上之反感。知愚日困闤　。尚未有聞。左右以多少爲疑似之詞。必亦無確證可知。結論謂瞎捧與受捧者之感想。令人神往。然捧者即如愚之所陳。與左右爲公開之辨論。瞎否懸諸尊評。不敢肊斷。而被捧之人。則本非素心。得之非出干求。受之何必愧色。以藝行道。不伐不矜。愚尚信梅氏有此涵養。敢爲左右告者也。關於大作。已盡鄙懷。更有欲盡者。一中國人好藐視成功之人。以自鳴其高介。二過於重視大學之學位。以折節於西洋。三輕視伶工之積習。亟宜蕩滌。夫梅氏以研究攻錯而赴美。幸而成功。亦其二十年來研精之所致。美人傾倒亦出於其自動之忱。以盡其至誠之意。固非鳴砲遣价之具文。則又何必以藐視倖竊之人。等量齊觀。且音樂戲劇。源出同途。國人赴美治音樂者。每得學位以歸。未聞當時涉及尊論。則戲劇家二十年舞臺上之經騐。與學問家五六年學校之課程。何嘗不可嫓美。博士之名。得之不足矜式。然必予之此而靳之彼。左右亦軒輊過甚矣。積習相沿。伶非高業。此爲專制時代之陋習。當非左右所樂承。今兹所謂戲劇文學。通俗敎育。又不廢斯道。左右必欲以伶工得膺博士爲誚。無乃近於思想之落伍若試律以英國莎士比。以集中英人之思想。榮裦綽楔。爲其有著作有學問。則梅氏舞臺上之經騐。及劇本。初未必遜於莎氏。何獨責於此而恕於彼。抑有陳者。前此意大利名伶卡羅沙氏。Ｃaruso在美演劇。於其病篤之時。意王以電文相慰。謂請爲意國珍重。蓋時意僑與美著。輙不相容。旣而美人感於卡氏之戲劇。少少泯其意見、意圖拓殖。將以此收濳移默化之功。特加重視。今梅氏出洋。賓筵致語。輙謂美人得更認識中國。且增加其親善云。國際酬酢之虚文。不必爲梅氏增重。然以今日之中國。出諸路透電所傳宣。左右苟易地爲美人。將視爲如何之國家。得一梅氏。使人知東方古國。尚有齊之以樂之一途。亦殊差强人意之事。願爲左右。浮一大白者也。（下略）</p>
<p>徐德輿。沈學謙。楊效曾諸君。而沈君更爲人材中之傑出者。當時每一演劇。若劇中有隂險派之角色。輙請沈君擔任。良以其表演深刻發音清晣。而更生成一副隂險面孔。一經化裝。神氣活現。實則沈君秉性和藹。絶無絲毫隂險思想。乃竟生成此一副隂險之面孔。以貌而相人。則沈君當爲例外者也。</p>
<p>戲劇協社公演莎翁名劇「威尼斯商人」其他角色。有十分稱職者。有稍見生疏者。我皆不論。獨沈君之猶太人夏洛克。其表演貪鄙卑劣之狀。竟無懈可擊。四五年前之威風。至今猶在。而在法庭上之一副上媚法官。下層平民。苟在舊式戲院中演此劇。則沈君當免不了吃許多香蕉皮。甘蔗渣也。</p>
<p>劇終。愚因沈君之表演。較前益精。因偕允修同趨後台訪之。所以誌我欽佩。而沈君撝謙不自滿。謂將力自奮勉。愚因沈君爲藝術界難得之人材。爰退而誌之。</p>

<p>第十二回别宴離筵拈花留倩影名園嘉會鬭茗覩芳姿</p>
<p>左詩晨暗暗地想。不但是頭髮要軟熟一些。便是性情也似頭髮一樣。須得軟熟一些。蕊雲雖然是出身孤苦。歷經患難。伊的脾氣却有時不大軟熟。和客氣的人還好。一和伊熟了。給人家釘子碰。不算一回事。左詩晨握筆在手。催促伊道。吃什麽菜。說出來。蕊雲道。你給我想吧。清爽點。牛肉弗喫。左詩晨給伊寫了一樣鷄絨鴿蛋湯。又道我想着了。你是喜歡吃冷鮑魚的。蕊雲也不否認。以下又點了三樣。一共是五樣。阿金說伊自已只要三樣就夠了。左詩晨道。大菜是容易飽又容易餓的。吃飽了肚子再說。左詩晨想。今天這一頓飯。在平日間是了無意義。吃吃白相相。他們也吃過好幾回的。這一回。可以算得是餞别。不見得再有請伊吃第二頓飯的餘暇了。這們一想。似手有一點小小的意味。而伊此去的前途。是進了天堂呢。還是入了地獄。是走上了幸福之門呢。還是闖到了憂患之宫。那末這個筵席。一面是好像歡送一位知已朋友。榮任了大官。正要走馬上任。一面却又像一個親屬。被人誣陷着。生生地送進了監獄。作臨歧的一别。可是這都是書獃子的一種痴想。本人是漠然無所感覺的。那時便問道。今天不再出堂唱了。那可以舒服一點。蕊雲道。不但今天不出。從明天起。也預備不出了。左詩晨還没有問原故。阿金便補充着說道。他們來關照不要出了。左詩晨問。什麽他們。阿金道。就是那章大少那裏。他們的意思是横豎到了節邊了。不出堂唱。也没有什麽大損失的。大阿姨意思。頂好出堂唱一直出到過門的那一天。伊自然只想堂唱多出一個。就多一塊錢。但是人家可答應伊嗎。外面阿囡嫁人的消息。客人中知道的已經不少了。伊還在出堂唱。閑話聽了無其數。搠壁脚。打破句。不曉得有多少人。我們自然只說没有這事。可是「瓶口紮得緊。人口紮弗緊。」那裏瞞得過人家呢。昨天就是章大少的媒人。典當裏的孫先生。他到生意上來。和大阿姨交涉。叫阿囡弗要再出堂唱了。横豎現在離節也不過兩三天了。左詩晨道。這是對的。已經確定了的。何必再出來奔波呢。樂得休息幾天了。過了節。不知幾時他們來接。</p>

<p>棉貨交易清淡新棉良好</p>
<p>二十日紐約電告一週間棉市狀况云、本週原棉之賣風、爲糧食與證劵市價之疲弱所激起、新棉作進行順利之說、與棉貨貿易不佳之報告、使原棉價格落至本棉季之新低底、新棉遠期一角二分半至一角三分之市價、已引起較多之注意、此乃徵諸國内外棉廠對於遠期之訊問而可知者、此種訊問、加以棉價現達於投資地位之見解、已有經紀商家更注意之結果、但大半係賣方補進、蓋聞棉帶夜間温度頗低、棉作近訊不甚良好也、惟據一般意見、棉作尚堪滿意、不過現需晴暖天氣耳、</p>
<p>又訊棉市繼續了結、其原因爲氣候良好、而證劵市塲及其他貨品又跌價也、以目前言、跌落或過甚、不過棉貨交易清淡、現棉需求疲弱、銷費不大、而新棉景象頗售云、附週末統計如左、（單位千包）</p>

<p>閘北昨市益覺罕見、河下非惟無貨抵埠、反將前日所停之米船、開去大半、一說因限價太嚴、開回内地、一說尚在滬西曹家渡、因此河中存底、連半載等船、共計不足二十號、全日雖大雨、買方祗得購買、防貨斷檔、北粳遂見飛漲、頂粳暗盤盤竟達二十四元左右、總計高次各粳、又跳一元之多、此種盤面、可稱破天荒之紀錄、薄稻變元一律隨升、各價並無準盤、頂變元已喊出二十元、全日祗有成交、因天雨未能開解、市中空氣極靜、表面上宛然無交、</p>

<p>的確、一個學校的精神、全省那個學校裏所出學東西怎樣而定、中央大學的半月刋出來以後這整個的學府頓時發出一絲有生命的光、在從前死氣沈沈的「學府中、」此刻已被這一點「學府的偉大的氣息」所温熱轉來了、</p>
<p>記得她（指半月刋）未産生的當兒、有人來參觀吾校說、「貴大學的死的方面、倒有中央大學一覽、貴大學活的方面、只有樹「止於至善」的銀牌的未來學土、其餘什麽都没有」、當時我聽了這段語、心中隱隱的作痛着、</p>
<p>現在、好在半月刋已霹一聲、而宣告産生了、這固然是我們應在開頭慶賀的、但同時外人批評我們學校的話、此刻也漸漸地消失牠的眞實性了、</p>
<p>可是中央大學的半月刋内容怎樣、這急是外人所欲聞的、雖然牠本身的内容、可以替牠說明、但我不妨在此要說二三句、就是她的内容分論著、研究、譯述、週查、文藝、雜著、消息七項、至牠的宗旨爲介紹世界學術、發展中大師大研究之結果、傳播中大進行的狀况爲宗旨、在客年十二月的時候、學校當局曾將出版文藝專號、增加篇幅、充實内容、結果甚深一般讀者之讚許呢、</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e3">Stock Market Crash in Various Countries <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>American stocks have already experienced two crashes. The German market has also been affected. Today, Japanese stocks have also been reported to have crashed. What follows will likely affect all major commercial nations in the world. This is because the increasing decline of commerce today is a global issue, not just a matter for one continent or one nation. As commerce declines, stocks naturally crash. The reason for the sequence is the varying sensitivity of economic organizations and the varying duration of the power to maintain the economy. But ultimately, none will be spared.</p>
<p>Therefore, given the current state of the world, regardless of the strength or weakness of a nation, all are struggling to take care of themselves. And the reason for this is not external, but originates from within. If they wish to remedy this, they cannot use force against each other, nor can they succeed overnight. There is no way to force people to buy to reverse the decline of commerce. The high number of unemployed workers cannot be forcibly accommodated. As commerce declines, more people become unemployed, and as commerce declines, the nation's finances become more strained. As the nation's finances become strained, there is no way to help the unemployed. Because of these three reasons, which feed on each other, the ways to deal with the situation become increasingly limited. Therefore, it is said that all nations in the world today are struggling to take care of themselves. If the unemployment problem cannot be resolved and disturbances arise, the decline of commerce will become even more unavoidable, and the world will become even more troubled.</p>

(2) On the evening of the 20th, Xu Yuanquan personally interrogated Wang Wenqing, the regimental commander of Zhang Zijiu's troops, who had been captured in Luohe.

They are currently constructing solid fortifications in the northwest. The soldiers, aside from casualties, have only five or sixty men per company, with thirty or forty bullets each. Their morale is low and they have decided to construct fortifications and hold out. (3) After Fan Zhongxiu's death in battle, his troops were led by Deng Baoshan and are still stationed in Xuchang. Feng arrived in Xuchang for sure on the afternoon of the 19th. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>Zhu Hexiang Issues Statement</p>
<p>Zhang Yinwu Requests Arrest of Meizubeile</p>
<p>Diplomatic Corps Remains in Wait-and-See Attitude</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the matter of the Tianjin Customs blockade, the Ministry of Finance received an order from the National Government on the afternoon of the 20th. On the 21st, the Customs Administration instructed Meilehe, the Shanghai Commissioner of Customs, to the effect that they were ordered to implement the Tianjin Customs blockade. All goods destined for Tianjin would be required to pay taxes equivalent to those levied at the nearby Jianghai, Yuehai, Xiamen, Qingdao, Dalian, Andong, Qinhuangdao, and Yingkou customs stations before being released. It was instructed that this be notified. The Tianjin Customs revenue is responsible for two parts: first, the old taxes are responsible for repaying the Boxer indemnity, which is designated to be remitted to the Shanghai HSBC Bank every week. Second, the new taxes are responsible for the mortgage of the two issues of the 2.5 treasury bills and demobilization public bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance. Originally, it was designated to be stored in the Central Bank, but because the Tianjin Central Bank has not yet been established, it has been changed to be stored in the Bank of Communications. The remaining amount of the customs' entire revenue, after paying for the above-mentioned mortgages, is small. It is now reported that the personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Finance have left Tianjin and gone south one after another. (21st)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Tianjin telephone: Simpson brought a new batch of Chinese and foreign staff to the customs to work, but how the tax revenue is, has not yet been calculated. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Zhu Hexiang's statement regarding the reinstatement of Tianjin Customs personnel stated that the customs personnel had resumed their duties this morning. Vacancies of those who had not arrived had been filled by transferring personnel from local agencies. The entire administration of the customs could be restored smoothly within a day or two. Beile's actions this time were extremely inappropriate. He should not have disrupted the work of the customs. Yan has repeatedly stated that there is no intention to use customs revenue. All parties will surely understand and assist. I dare to declare that Meizubeile should bear full responsibility for the regrettable events that occurred in Tianjin. In the future, if the administration of Tianjin Customs is disrupted, they will still be held accountable. It has been found that Meizubeile has been issuing orders every day, using the concession as a shield to obstruct the work of the customs and disrupt local public order. Therefore, a protest must be lodged, and it is hoped that the responsible officials of the countries stationed in Tianjin will no longer allow him to act. I have obtained evidence that these two have harbored political intentions for five weeks and request that they be deported and punished. It has also been found that a customs officer of Norwegian nationality directed the blockade of the customs and stole many important customs documents. This is undoubtedly instigated by Beile. I will take strict measures to punish this act of theft. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The Dutch envoy Oudendijk told reporters today that the diplomatic corps has not yet discussed the two cases of the Tianjin Customs takeover and blockade, nor has it received a formal report from the Tianjin Consular Body. Therefore, the diplomatic corps remains in a wait-and-see attitude. The discussions among the countries involved in recent days have been solely about the issues of tax reporting and the passage of goods, not meetings of the diplomatic corps. I know Simpson very well, but Simpson's excessive talking has attracted the attention of various countries. I hope that Mr. Simpson can use his swift skills to ease the concerns of all parties and resolve the Tianjin Customs issue as soon as possible. He also said that the diplomatic corps did not raise the issue of the detention of customs revenue in Guangzhou in 1925. However, the countries involved may have inquired about it. This should not be considered as originating from the diplomatic corps. Moreover, China's customs duties are already autonomous, and other countries cannot interfere in customs administration, but they may consider and pay attention to matters within the scope of trade and creditor's rights. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Simpson telegraphed Beijing that there is no need to worry about customs officers going on strike. There are many unemployed people everywhere, so it would be better to reorganize separately. If the regular customs personnel go on strike, the consolidated tax bureau can collect taxes on their behalf, which would be more convenient. Yan replied with great praise. Today, the diplomatic corps discussed having the consular body act on behalf of customs and collect taxes to avoid losses for merchants. The tax money will be transferred to the customs in the future. Japan has already done this first. Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Sweden, and Denmark are continuing to implement it. Germany is more cautious, saying that the passage of German goods may have to wait a few days, and the losses will have to be attributed to the merchants' fortune, so as not to offend China or order them to pay taxes at the Tianjin Customs in conjunction. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Negotiations on the Tianjin Customs issue did not make progress last night. The Foreign Affairs Department asked Yan for instructions to request the British envoy to punish Beile and expel him from China. Today, Xin sent a telegram to the Foreign Affairs Department, stating that since personnel are on strike, people from Beijing and Tianjin who want to work at the customs are flocking to offer their services. If the old customs officers do not return to work by 9:00 AM on the 23rd, I will establish a new team of customs officers on that day. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin Customs resumed operations on the 21st. The old Chinese staff all signed in, but because the foreign staff had not arrived, the documents were locked in iron cabinets, and there was no official business to conduct. Newly appointed customs officers are providing service. On the 21st, six merchant ships paid taxes and exited. Regular Customs also sent personnel to resume work on the 21st. Simpson telegraphed Zhu Hexiang on the afternoon of the 21st, asking the British Minister to order the British Consul in Tianjin to expel Beile. There were rumors that the Japanese Consulate had sent personnel to take over a part of the customs, which is not true. Simpson's attitude is calm. The 22nd is a Sunday, and internal personnel will still work as usual (21st)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Reuters interviewed Simpson this morning. Simpson said that he is currently working hard to handle customs affairs with a number of Chinese staff. These staff are mostly transferred from other government offices. By Monday, things will be at least orderly, and a foreign customs officer has been hired to manage the parcel department of the post office. The customs was quite lively today, with people coming to seek employment, others coming to inquire, and cargo owners coming to probe for news. The crowd numbered about several hundred people. However, judging from the current situation, customs work cannot proceed yet. The Tianjin Consular Body convened a meeting this morning to discuss how to deal with the overall situation. (Reuters report on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After Regular Customs closed, the BeiNing Railway refused to load and unload goods, which greatly hindered the business community. If no temporary measures are taken for the luggage of passengers passing through, it seems that foreign residents of Tianjin who go out for vacation will also be greatly inconvenienced. (Reuters report on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Zhu Hexiang issued a statement tonight, stating that Tianjin Customs had resumed operations this morning, and most of the staff had returned. Those who had not arrived were replaced by transferring personnel from various government offices. Furthermore, customs duties are now being collected as usual. (Reuters report on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Xin Boshen, the head of Tianjin Customs, led the tax collectors from the Bank of Communications and temporary customs personnel to the customs office at 9:00 AM this morning to begin formal office work. (Japan News Agency report on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the Tianjin Customs closure issue, as a result of the Consular Body's meeting, the United Kingdom and Japan advocated that the customs affairs be handled on behalf of the consular body by shipping companies and customs brokers. The consuls of the United States and France advocated that Tianjin be a free port, with no need for foreign consuls to handle customs affairs on their behalf. Ships from various countries could enter and exit freely, and goods could pass through freely. Therefore, opinions were inconsistent. It was decided to hold another meeting on the 23rd (Japan News Agency report on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The closure of Tianjin Customs gave the countries involved a big shock. They had no choice but to have the Consular Body continue to conduct Customs affairs. Xin Boshen announced today the hiring of twenty new customs officers. Formally, Tianjin Customs has started operations again. Countries have not yet decided on their attitude toward this. (Electric Communication News on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Mayor of Tianjin, Zhang Yinwu, requested the British Consul-General today to arrest the former Customs Director, Pi'er, for leading the entire Tianjin Customs staff to cease operations. (Electric Communication News on the 21st</p>
<p>(Beijing) The leader of the diplomatic corps, Envoy Oudendijk, told a reporter who visited him today that no matter how the Tianjin Customs issue unfolds, if it does not directly affect the guarantee of foreign debt, the diplomatic corps will regard it as China's internal affair and will not interfere in any way. Therefore, the diplomatic corps has no plans to hold a meeting at present. (Electric Communication News on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The Japanese Consulate-General in Tianjin had begun to handle customs affairs as an expedient measure for the customs closure, but the Japanese Embassy in Beijing telegraphed the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin yesterday, ordering him to temporarily suspend operations until instructions were received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The embassy also urgently dispatched Foreign Affairs official Gendao to the Tianjin Consulate-General to assist in everything. (Electric Communication News on the 21st)</p>

<p>(Beijing) Yesterday, dozens of representatives and politicians left Beijing for Taiyuan to urge the speedy formation of a government, saying that this trip would surely be successful. However, key figures in Shanxi said that the government must be produced by the Party. Yan has repeatedly stated that the government must do things, not accommodate idlers, and cannot be hastily cobbled together. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>(Beijing) Li Shucheng, Nie Xiangxi, Hu Jiesan, and over twenty others urged Yan to form a government quickly so that financial affairs could be handled. Yan said that it was not about the name, but about doing practical things, and thanked them with a smile.

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 21st, specially appointing Zhang Xueliang as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This order is issued. (21st)</p>
<h3 id="e10">Compilation of Military Reports from Various Sources <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Capital Garrison Headquarters announced on the 21st, compiling reports from various telegraphs: (1) According to confirmed reports, the enemy suffered significant losses in the battle of Yu City and Luan River Estuary. On the 8th of this month, the enemy requisitioned over 700 civilian houses in Cang County for use as rear hospitals. On the 11th, seven trainloads of wounded soldiers departed from Dezhou for Cang County, each train carrying approximately 300 soldiers, totaling over 2,000 across the seven trains. This indicates that the enemy suffered substantial losses in this battle. (2) The enemy's rear is very vulnerable. Aside from approximately two divisions of newly arrived Shaanxi troops in Cang County, no troops were seen along the route from Cangzhou to Tianjin. (3) The enemy soldiers are in tattered uniforms, appearing like beggars, and march with heads hanging low, lacking any semblance of bravery. Six or seven out of ten soldiers are thin and weak, hardly fit for battle. (4) During the battle of Yu City, many enemy soldiers deserted, forming groups of three or five, hiding in the countryside, extorting and robbing, incidents of which occur frequently, causing great suffering to the villagers. (5) The rebel enemies in the Jinan area of Hebei Province strictly ordered each village to raise funds of up to 60 yuan, with a three-day deadline. Those who exceed the deadline will have the village head dealt with under military law, so the villagers dare to be angry but dare not speak out. (6) According to fleeing rebel soldiers, the enemy's supplies are severely lacking, and they cannot get a full meal all day long. The rebel soldiers cannot endure the hunger and are deserting in droves. (7) The rebel enemies in northern Shandong and southern Hebei are ordering local counties to supply white flour, with a deadline for delivery, so villages are grinding wheat all night long, fearing punishment for missing the deadline. (8) The remaining enemy troops in Qing City are extremely frightened by our army's encirclement and attacks and are eager to surrender. Furthermore, according to captured wounded soldiers, Huo Yuanbi, the division commander who engaged in fierce fighting with us near Qing City, and more than a dozen regimental commanders have indeed been killed by our artillery fire, causing a great shaking of the rebel army's morale. (9) Our army advanced from Maguanji to the Tiefo Temple-Huzhuang line in the morning. The newly formed 1st Division of rebel Sun Liangcheng's troops resisted along the Pinggang-Guoba line. After we launched a multi-pronged attack, our left wing broke through the Pinggang line and pursued the fleeing enemy westward. At the same time, the right wing also captured Guoba, completely defeating the enemy. In this battle, we captured one rebel brigade commander, Guo Qingyuan, disguised in women's clothing, more than ten regimental commanders, and over 500 soldiers, intercepted five or six mortars, and more than ten boxes of assorted infantry and cavalry firearms and ammunition. (10) According to a report from party members sent from Xuchang, after the bandit Fan Zhongxiu was killed by our bombing, the rebel Feng feared that the bandit army would be difficult to command. Over the past two days, Feng disarmed part of Fan's army in Xuchang and transferred another part to Zhengzhou for reorganization. Fan's army refused to comply and rose up in resistance, engaging in fierce battles with Feng's troops for several days and nights. Feng's forces suffered heavy losses, and the situation has not yet been resolved. (11) Sun's rebel 4th Division of Jin Wanhua's two brigades and his 10th Division of Ma Xiren's troops, along with a rebel cavalry regiment, launched a pincer attack on our army from three locations: Grandma Temple, Lizhuang, and Xiaoqing River in Xiànchǒu. They selected over 800 dare-to-die troops, who arrived at Weigang from the Zheluo Avenue, agreeing with the enemy besieged in Bozhou to signal with fire. The enemy in Bozhou then broke out from the northwest, launching a fierce counterattack and engaging in close combat. They were eventually repelled by our army. After a night of intense fighting, by dawn, we had begun to disperse the rebel enemy, which collapsed in disarray. In this battle, we killed rebel brigade commander Cui Bangjie, chief of staff Wang Fuchang, and one regimental commander and several company and platoon commanders, totaling over thirty, as well as over a hundred soldiers. We captured over 1,000 soldiers, over 20 horses, over 800 rifles and pistols, and countless military supplies. We are currently searching for the remaining enemy, who have no fighting spirit left and will be annihilated soon. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e11">The Rumor of International Intervention <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>An Expression from a Certain Important Person in the National Government</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, there has been a sudden rumor that a certain country will interfere in China's internal affairs. A visit was made to a certain important person in the National Government to inquire about the origin of this peculiar rumor. The reply was as follows: The rumor circulating in Shanghai that a certain country might interfere in China's internal affairs is entirely a fabrication by Henry, the chief correspondent in China for the New York Times. Henry is the New York Times correspondent in Peiping and is known for creating an atmosphere unfavorable to China. Last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the US Minister to China requesting his expulsion, and at the same time notified the Ministry of Communications to suspend his telegrams. Henry then returned to the United States in March of this year. Now he has returned to China again and still has not changed his original attitude, which is regrettable. The government will take appropriate measures against him when necessary. Currently, the United States is experiencing a large decrease in foreign trade, a sharp drop in securities, and an unusually depressed market. Countries such as England, France, and Germany are all suffering from trade stagnation and increased unemployment. Therefore, they are paying close attention to the Chinese market, and they are concerned that the Chinese civil war is affecting trade in China. Therefore, the rumor of a joint intervention in China's internal conflicts has arisen in response to the times. Henry's statement is not entirely without cause, but as for interfering in China's internal affairs, a few ambitious industrialists and businessmen may inevitably have such proposals, but the vast majority would never dare to commit such an injustice. It is said that the reason why various countries want to interfere in China's internal turmoil is actually to seek to increase their commerce in China, but the success or failure of commerce must depend on how the people of the host country feel about the friendship with their own country. In the past, boycotts of British goods severely hurt British merchants, and boycotts of Japanese goods brought Japanese merchants to the brink of bankruptcy, which can serve as precedents. National psychology is extremely important. If we interfere in China's internal conflicts to expand commerce, the result may be counterproductive. Various countries are planning to expand their markets in China and should first gain the goodwill of the Chinese people, which cannot be achieved by force. The so-called international intervention is a matter of atmosphere and is not likely to be realized. However, the Chinese people should be aware that various countries are plotting against us. Our people should sincerely support the central government, overthrow all reactionary warlords, and build a new China, so that foreigners will have no excuse. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

As for the quantity of silver produced and sold in various countries, in addition to requesting the Chinese ambassadors and consuls stationed abroad to investigate on their behalf, it has also been instructed that the customs houses send letters to the statistical offices of foreign customs houses to investigate. Once the investigation is completed, it will be reported to the Executive Yuan and then submitted to the Central Political Council. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Qian Chairman Mao Dingxiang telegraphed the Central National Government, stating: "I recently heard reports that Liu, an official dispatched by me, is in contact with Jin, and that Yan is being summoned to Dezhou, which has greatly surprised me. I have never had any representative contact with any provinces in the north. Previously, cases of impostors were discovered, which were denied through telegraphic announcements and repeated solemn declarations. It is not known whether the so-called Liu is an impostor or a propaganda tactic from the reactionary side. Since there is no name, further investigation is needed. However, since I was entrusted with the administration of Qian Province by your order, all measures have been taken to support the central government and obey the orders of your government. Considering the environment and location of Qian Province, it has long become a situation of relying on the central government for self-consolidation. To seek stability in Qian Province, there is no other way than to promote the unification of the central government. This calculation has also been thoroughly determined. Moreover, the north is a den of reactionary fugitives and has no direct interest in Qian Province. Although I am unworthy, I would never dare to go against reason and seek afar, only to throw myself into a dead end. I swear to your Excellency to support you to the end with the utmost sincerity. My character is at stake, and Heaven and Earth can bear witness. In addition to thoroughly investigating the name of Liu and issuing a telegraphic announcement, I hereby state my position in advance, and I beg you to take note." (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Mausoleum Management Committee received a report on the 20th from the Biyun Temple General Manager's Office, which maintains the Clothing Mound: "On the 11th, Wang Zixuan, adjutant of Fan's Eighth Route Army, claimed that Fan's coffin would be transported to Peiping soon and designated the General Manager's Memorial Hall as the place to place the coffin. Because the portrait and crystal coffin of the General Manager are located there, we politely refused. However, the adjutant insisted on borrowing it and only agreed not to move the portrait and crystal coffin, but to place the coffin on the left side of the Memorial Hall when it arrived. We are now conducting strict negotiations. We will report further developments." Lin Sen, Standing Committee Member of the Mausoleum Management Committee, sent a private telegram on the 21st to Xie Zou to prevent this, stating: "The people of the north respect the General Manager, so after the removal, a memorial hall was established in Biyun Temple, leaving this historical site for eternal admiration. There are many famous places in Peiping, and it is not difficult to find another location. Why insist on using the General Manager's Memorial Hall, which is shocking to hear. Moreover, Xing Min followed the General Manager for many years during his life. If the deceased had knowledge, he would not be comfortable receiving such honors. It is hoped that you will find a way to prevent this." (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 20th: After the British Colonial Office published a white paper announcing its plan to unify the administration of the three provinces of the former German East Africa under mandate, to establish a High Commissioner to manage postal, telegraph, customs, and local defense affairs, German newspapers, regardless of their faction, have made fierce discussions. The conservative Paulsen newspaper said, "It is clear that the preparatory period has ended, and the British government can now openly violate the Treaty of Versailles and establish a large autonomous territory in the former German East Africa colonies. The German government should make efforts to stop the British merger of the former German colonies." The democratic Fortschritt newspaper and the monarchist Kreuz newspaper both stated that when British Foreign Secretary Henderson replied to former Foreign Minister Stresemann, he guaranteed that the British government would submit this matter to the Mandates Commission of the League of Nations. Its publication of the white paper is a violation of past understandings.

<p>Market Suddenly Seized by Panic</p>
<p>Trade Deficits Accumulate Monthly</p>
<p>Reuter's Tokyo dispatch, 21st: The stock market has been plunging for days, with stockholders desperately selling their shares. Banks and insurance companies are also disposing of their stocks and selling them off one after another, creating a situation where the entire market seems to be selling. Yesterday afternoon, trade figures for the middle of the month, contrary to expectations, showed a deficit of 11 million yen. The market took this as a trigger, and a panic-driven plunge ensued, causing the Tokyo stock index to fall below 100 yen, the lowest price in 25 years. Even first-class stocks are mostly below par.</p>
<p>Reuter's Tokyo dispatch, 21st: The trade deficit for the middle of June is 11 million yen, bringing the cumulative deficit since January of this year to 216 million yen.

<p>A Grand Celebration Will Be Held</p>
<p>The World News Agency reports that Iceland is the oldest country in the world to have a parliament. The island founded a parliament in the year 930 AD, and this year marks its one-thousandth anniversary. The Danish government (Iceland is part of Denmark) has scheduled a grand celebration from the 22nd to the 29th of this month. King Christian and Queen Alexandrine will personally attend the ceremony on the 24th. Countries from around the world will send representatives. Norway will be represented by Crown Prince Olav and his wife, and Sweden by Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf and his wife. U.S. President Hoover will send Senator Norbeck and Representative Bernays, along with three others, as representatives. The United Kingdom plans to send a member of the royal family, and Canada will send its two federal prime ministers. The entire island of Iceland only has shrubs and no large trees, so the New York Arboretum Club will donate several tree species. The celebration will be held in Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, and in Thingvellir, where the parliament first convened one thousand years ago. The parliamentary site is surrounded by mountains on three sides and bordered by a river on one side. The Icelanders call it the "Plain of Parliament," which extends for three miles. Iceland is an isolated county in the North Atlantic, 700 miles from Denmark. It is the second largest island in Europe and has a very cold climate with many volcanoes.

<h3 id="e63">Reporting on Recent Diplomatic Situation <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 20th), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dispatched Bao Jingan of the Intelligence Department to the Central Broadcasting Station to report on the recent diplomatic situation as follows: "The most important diplomatic news of the past week is summarized as follows: (1) The Sino-Soviet issue is currently a major diplomatic event. Not only is the entire Chinese population paying attention to it, but other countries are also paying close attention to it. Therefore, I will first report on the Sino-Soviet issue. Currently, our representative, Mo Dehui, is still in Moscow conducting informal exchanges of views with the Soviet plenipotentiary representative, Karakhan, in order to seek common ground. This will save many difficulties when the formal meeting opens. The date of the formal meeting has not yet been fully determined. It is regrettable that the Soviet Union is still unwilling to completely release the detained overseas Chinese as the Sino-Soviet conference is about to open. The ministry recently received a telegram from the Consul-General stationed in Vladivostok stating that there are still more than 100 detainees in the Vladivostok area. Most of them have been forcibly charged by the Russian side with disrupting finance, espionage, and counter-revolution, and do not acknowledge that they were arrested because of the Sino-Soviet conflict. In addition, property worth about 200,000 Russian rubles was confiscated during the arrest, and most of it has not been returned. We are currently continuing to strive for their release. After receiving the telegram, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed the Consul-General instructing him to continue negotiations. At the same time, it telegraphed the Special Envoy Zhong stationed in Harbin to lodge a serious protest with the Soviet Consul-General stationed in Harbin. In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report from Ju Zengqi, an attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Moscow, stating that many overseas Chinese were arrested after the outbreak of the Sino-Soviet issue and sent to lumber yards in the mountains near Khabarovsk. There are more than 300 Chinese in the mountains who are subjected to various forms of abuse and cannot bear the hardship. More than 200 people were released from Chita after the Sino-Soviet issue was resolved, but more than 100 people have not yet been released. More than 100 overseas Chinese arrested in western Siberia have now been sent to the Mariinsk lumber yard to cut timber. This matter is inconsistent with the previous agreement. Both sides promised that overseas Chinese citizens of both sides arrested for the Sino-Soviet incident after May 1, 1929, would not be categorized and would be released unconditionally. Subsequently, the Chinese authorities immediately released all arrested Russians near Harbin. At the same time, in January of this year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also received a telegram from the Chinese Embassy in Germany stating that the German government had received formal notification from the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs that all Chinese citizens arrested throughout the Soviet Union for the Sino-Soviet dispute had been released. According to reports from various sources, the Soviet Union has not fully fulfilled the release of all arrested overseas Chinese, which shows its lack of sincerity. In addition to telegraphing the Special Envoy Zhong stationed in Harbin to lodge a serious protest with the Soviet Consul-General stationed in Harbin, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed Representative Mo to quickly question the Soviet representative and ensure the prompt release of all detained overseas Chinese. (2) Protecting overseas Chinese and party affairs. Regarding the protection of overseas Chinese citizens and the elimination of various unequal treatments, the ministry is currently comprehensively planning and proceeding step by step according to a predetermined plan. For countries with treaties, we are striving to negotiate the abolition of old and harsh practices. For countries without treaties, we are conducting separate negotiations to conclude commercial treaties based on the principle of equality and reciprocity to seek fundamental improvement. Regarding the mistreatment of Chinese workers, difficulties in entry, and the levying of exorbitant taxes, we are actively negotiating separately with the countries concerned and are also negotiating revisions to the immigration regulations of various countries, with a view to abolishing discriminatory regulations against overseas Chinese in various countries. Once China's newly concluded treaties of friendship and commerce with various countries are established in order, the treatment of overseas Chinese can gradually be improved. Regarding the British Governor of Singapore's forced dissolution of the party headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is still actively negotiating. Recently, according to a telegram from Minister Shi stationed in the United Kingdom, the British Foreign Office previously replied that it had not received a report from the British Governor of Singapore and therefore could not handle it. Later, it stated that although the report from the Governor of Singapore had been received, the content was not clear enough and the Colonial Office needed to investigate it in detail before it could reply. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed the Minister stationed in the United Kingdom and the Consul-General stationed in Singapore to continue active negotiations. As for the previous report from the South African General Branch stating that the South African Parliament had passed a bill limiting all Chinese merchants operating in South Africa after 1919 to closing their businesses within five years and requesting negotiations, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, upon receiving the news, considered that this matter was of great importance to the lives and property of overseas Chinese and immediately telegraphed the Consul-General stationed in South Africa to inquire. According to reports, the South African Parliament did not discuss this matter during this session, and the report from the South African General Branch may be a misunderstanding. (3) Treaty issues. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received a telegram from Minister Gao Lu stationed in France stating that the instruments of ratification of the Sino-Greek Treaty of Friendship and Commerce were exchanged with the Greek representative at the Chinese Embassy in Paris on the 14th of this month. The original instrument of ratification was sent by mail. The Sino-American Arbitration Treaty was delayed in signing because our country had made some amendments to Article 3 of the treaty. The United States has now accepted our opinion, and the treaty is being translated into French. Once the translation is completed, it can be formally signed. The purpose of this treaty is that if disputes arise between the two contracting countries that cannot be resolved through diplomatic methods, they will be submitted to arbitration, but issues involving the internal affairs of the contracting countries cannot be cited in this treaty. The Sino-Turkish Commercial Treaty has been negotiated several times, and the views of both sides are quite close. The Turkish Chargé d'Affaires Forde will come to Beijing next Monday to continue consultations, and a draft treaty can probably be signed soon. (4) Election of Council Members to the League of Nations. The 11th General Assembly of the League of Nations is scheduled to open in Geneva on September 10. The Council, which presides over the affairs of the conference, is divided into permanent and non-permanent members. The election of non-permanent members is based on the principle of continental representation and is held at each General Assembly. Our country was previously elected as a non-permanent member, but we failed to be re-elected last year. The former Beijing government did not pay much attention to this matter. Since the establishment of the National Government, it has attached great importance to China's position in the international community. Therefore, it is actively seeking to be elected in this year's re-election. To this end, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed Ministers Wu, Jiang, and Gao, instructing them to contact the governments of various countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now received telegrams from various ministers reporting on the contact situation. According to a telegram from Minister Gao stationed in France, France has always expressed sympathy for our country and a satisfactory result can be obtained in this re-election. The United Kingdom and Spain have expressed their support. Other countries, such as Czechoslovakia, Siam, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Yugoslavia, Uruguay, Paraguay, Haiti, and Nicaragua, have also expressed their intention to support China's election. Therefore, China has a good chance of being elected to the Council of the League of Nations this year."</p>
<h3 id="e64">He Yingqin Goes to Hunan to Comfort the Troops <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states that after receiving He Jian's report on the recapture of Changsha on the 17th, He Yingqin, Director of the Wuhan Headquarters, immediately telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chiang to report the victory and planned to personally go to Hunan to comfort the troops and give instructions. On the afternoon of the 18th, he ordered personnel from the Staff Department, Adjutant Department, and Secretariat of the headquarters to prepare to depart with him. At 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 19th, all important personnel and guards boarded the Wanhua steamer of the Sanbei Company at the riverside wharf. The streets from the headquarters on Huashang Street to the left side of the Sanbei Wharf were guarded by soldiers of the 3rd Regiment of the Military Police with guns. The roads on the right side were guarded by armed soldiers of the Wuhan Garrison Command. The road from the riverbank to the Sanbei pier was patrolled by the Military Police Regiment and the Investigation Team of the Garrison Command, providing strict protection. French Consul Bosde also ordered French sailors stationed in Hankou to land and protect the French Concession, which was extremely thorough. At 6:05 PM, He arrived at the wharf by car from the headquarters. Those accompanying him included Leng Xin, Advisor to the Ministry of Military Affairs; Zhou Weigang, Chief of the Staff Department of the Headquarters; Wang Wenyan, Chief of the Adjutant Department; Liu Jianqun, Director of the Secretariat; Xie Boyuan, Chief of the Confidential Section; Wang Shi, Counselor; and important officers from the Transportation Department, Medical Department, and Accounting Department, as well as a company of guards and all staff of the 9th Radio Station. After shaking hands with the people who came to see him off, He boarded the Wanhua steamer, weighed anchor, and departed. The Desheng warship escorted the steamer. It is reported that after He went to Hunan, the Director of the Wuhan Headquarters will be temporarily replaced by Qian Dajun, Commander of the 3rd Training Division. The duties of the Chief of Staff will be performed by Wang Lun, Deputy Chief of Staff. He is expected to return to Hankou in about a week. (June 20)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Situation of the 4th Route Army Recapturing Changsha <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Changsha states that the five routes of the Central Army encircled Changsha, and Li Zongren and others abandoned Changsha and retreated to Youxian and Liling, as detailed in previous communications. Early in the morning of the 17th, Wei Suzhong, Deputy Commander of the 15th Division of the 4th Route Army under He Jian, personally led the two regiments of Hou Pengfei and Tian Yingtang, departing from Bairuo Township in Ningxiang County and arriving at the opposite bank of the provincial capital, near Yuelu Mountain, Yingwan City, and the water and land of Shuiluzhou. Li Zongren deployed the Tang Shengming's troops along the riverbank of the province, from Houzi Stone in the upper reaches to Nanhugang in the lower reaches, digging trenches and preparing to defend to the death. The Changsha General Chamber of Commerce sent representatives Zhou Anhan and Wang Zhengshi to negotiate with Tang again and again, asking him to consider the local people and retreat with the Guangxi army and not fight in the provincial capital.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Tang initially refused, and then said that his army was mostly composed of Hunan natives and would never be willing to go with the Guangxi army again. He asked representatives Zhou and Wang to convey to Deputy Commander Wei and Regiment Commander Hou, requesting that Commander-in-Chief He allow him to be incorporated and asking the Chamber of Commerce to honor the army's promissory notes of 50,000 yuan in full before he would not fight in Changsha, otherwise he would never withdraw. Zhou and Wang agreed to telegraph the Chamber of Commerce immediately to find a way to raise the money for the promissory notes and stated that the issue of surrender would have to be referred to the authorities. They then consulted Deputy Commander Wei and Regiment Commander Hou on the opposite bank by telephone. Wei and Hou replied at the time that this matter would have to be submitted to Commander-in-Chief He for approval and that Tang's troops must withdraw from Changsha before there could be room for negotiation, and they gave Tang's troops a deadline of 7:00 PM on the 17th to withdraw, and the army decided to cross the river at 8:00 PM. Zhou and Wang negotiated with Tang Shengming again, asking him to withdraw from Changsha temporarily and then discuss it further, but Tang refused. Until 6:00 PM, the Chamber of Commerce had only raised 5,000 yuan for the promissory notes of 50,000 yuan, so Tang Shengming absolutely refused to withdraw. Zhou and Wang were exhausted, but to no avail, and negotiations broke down. At 10:00 PM on the 17th, Deputy Commander Wei, knowing that Tang had no intention of withdrawing, divided his forces into three routes and forced a crossing of the river simultaneously by rowing. Tang Shengming also resisted along the way. The two sides made contact and held each other for about an hour. Regiment Commander Hou had crossed the river and landed from the South Gate. Tang's troops could not hold and fled en masse from Xiaowumen along the Zhuping Road. One part of them was surrounded and disarmed outside Xiaowumen because they could not retreat in time. At 12:00 AM that night, Deputy Commander Wei and Regiment Commanders Hou and Tian entered the city one after another. Tang Shengming frequently told people on the road that his troops were unwilling to cooperate with the Guangxi faction and that he would retreat to Baowu and await reorganization. Early in the morning of the 18th, all stores opened for business and operated as usual, and the city was peaceful as usual. People from all walks of life went to visit Generals Wei, Hou, and Tian to express their condolences and inquire about the military situation. According to Wei and others, his army (Wei Brigade) had encountered only about one enemy camp on its way from Yiyang to the province and had routed it immediately, and there were no traces of the enemy along the way until they made contact when crossing the river in the provincial capital. Commander-in-Chief He is currently in Yiyang and has dispatched a car to welcome him today (the 18th), and he will arrive in the province within days. All circles in the province are now preparing to welcome him. (June 18)</p>

<p>A dispatch from Guangzhou states that the armies from Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Hubei have launched a major encirclement against Zhang and Gui's armies. The Guangdong army's division under Jiang Guangnai has advanced from Hengshan towards the front, and the division under Cai Tingkai has also arrived in Youxian County. The rear division under Li Yangjing has also stationed in Hengshan from Hengyang. Once the Jiangxi's Lu Division arrives at its destination, the order for a general offensive can be issued. Commander-in-Chief of the 8th Route Army Chen Jitang, in order to personally supervise the troops, departed from Guangzhou on the Yuehan train to Shaoguan at 8:00 AM on the 15th and then transferred to Chenzhou. It is understood that those who departed with Chen on that day included Brigade Commander Huang Renhuan, Secretary-General Chen Yukun, and dozens of officers from the headquarters of the 8th Route Army. They arrived in Shaoguan at about 5:00 PM that afternoon. Military and political circles in Shaoguan, having received the telegram in advance, were waiting at the station to greet them. After Chen Jitang got off the train, he rested briefly at the station and was hosted by He Luo, Director of the Military Station; Regiment Commander Fan Dexing; and the Magistrate of Qujiang County. He then went to the headquarters for a rest. It is reported that Chen plans to rest in Shaoguan for one day and depart from Shaoguan for Hunan this morning (the 17th). It is estimated that he will arrive in Chenzhou after the 20th. The First Air Squadron also departed from Shaoguan under the leadership of Huang Guangrui on the 16th. (June 17)</p>

<p>Jin Yun'e Talks About the Situation of Sun's Army in Bozhou</p>
<p>A dispatch from Xuzhou states that, according to reports from the front, in addition to defending the trenches with most of its forces, the enemy on the Longhai Line has also launched attacks on our side with a small number of troops, which have been repelled. Currently, the front-line positions of the two armies are about 40 li apart, and the flanks are about 30 li apart. The two sides on the front line sometimes exchange artillery fire. The deployment of the Central Army has now been finalized, and a general offensive was launched against the enemy on the evening of the 17th. According to news from the railway, after the enemy's defeat, they often use plainclothes teams to gather bandits in an attempt to destroy our line. The railway bureau, in order to prevent this, has long organized an engineering train, led by He Xianhua, Chief of the Engineering Section, to depart for the front. The Jinpu Railway is now also following suit and has sent Deputy Engineer Zhu Weibin to Xuzhou to contact the Transportation Command and establish an engineering train for mobile repairs of the railway line. Currently, the traffic is smooth on the western route from Xuzhou to Minquan, and the rails on the northern route of Dawenkou have also been repaired by the armored train "Beiping" sent by Director He of the Headquarters. Regarding the situation of Sun Dianying's army in Bozhou, Jin Yun'e said that when he arrived near Bozhou City, he saw that the Central Army's forces under Wang and Yang were still besieging the city and could not enter. He had to write a letter himself and send it by plane to the city, advising Sun to pledge his allegiance to the Central Government. The Central Army's forces besieging Bozhou were only a few miles away, and Sun's army was cut off from supplies. Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan often used planes to drop flour, cigarettes, and other items into Bozhou from the air, but there were few. Jin has gone to the front this morning (the 19th) to report everything to Chiang. (June 19)</p>
<p>Wuhan Headquarters</p>
<h3 id="e68">Arrest Warrants for Zhao Hengti and Zhang Yinghua <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Former Hunan Military Governor Zhao Hengti, Minister of Finance Zhang Yinghua, and over ten others have recently secretly arrived in Hankou. They are believed to be residing within the Japanese concession. There are also rumors that Zhao is about to assume the spurious position of Two-Lakes Circuit Commissioner, spreading rumors and creating a tense atmosphere. This matter was discovered by the Hankou municipal Party headquarters. On the 18th, a letter was sent to the military headquarters requesting negotiations with the Japanese consulate for their extradition. In response to the letter, the military headquarters issued an order on the 19th to the Wuhan Garrison Command and the Hankou Municipal Public Security Bureau to issue arrest warrants with rewards. The letter from the municipal Party headquarters and the order from the military headquarters are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter from the Municipal Party Headquarters: It has been secretly reported that over ten individuals, including the remnants of the warlord Zhao Hengti and Zhang Yinghua, recently arrived in Hankou aboard a Japanese ship. They are secretly hiding in the Japanese concession, colluding with reactionary elements, and plotting disturbances. All levels of the municipal Party headquarters and various people's organizations in this city are extremely indignant about this. They have come to the headquarters one after another, requesting serious negotiations with the Japanese consulate and the secret arrest and severe punishment of the traitor Zhao Hengti and others to quell their treacherous schemes. Hankou is located in a vital strategic position, and reactionary elements should not be allowed to disrupt its security. However, the Japanese consulate disregards diplomatic relations and protects the traitorous party, which is deeply regrettable. In addition to sending a letter to the Hankou Special Municipal Government requesting them to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese consulate, we are also sending this letter to your esteemed military headquarters. Please investigate, promptly dispatch a team to secretly arrest Zhao Hengti and his accomplices, and ensure they are severely punished to curb the burgeoning unrest and maintain security. This is a matter of great public importance.</p>
<p>Order from the Military Headquarters Regarding the Issuance of Arrest Warrants with Rewards: It has been found that the two major bandits Zhao Hengti and Zhang Yinghua have long been a scourge to the people. Their crimes are obvious. They have now secretly arrived in Hankou, colluding with vagrants, intending to disrupt social stability and tranquility. Multiple pieces of evidence have been found through repeated investigations, proving their extreme culpability. They must be apprehended immediately to eliminate the traitors. Therefore, this order is issued to the commander, directing all subordinates to conduct strict investigations and arrests. Once they are apprehended, they are authorized to be executed on the spot, without any leniency. Regardless of whether Zhao and Zhang are captured alive or shot dead, a reward of ten thousand yuan will be given for each person apprehended to show encouragement. This order is urgent.

<h3 id="e69">Plan for Developing Mineral Resources Throughout the Province <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Establishment of a Mineral Resources Survey Team</p>
<p>Dividing the Province into Seven Major Regions</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: Since the merger of the Agricultural and Mining Department into the Hubei Construction Department, a specialized department has been added to manage agricultural and mining affairs. There are also active plans for development. Hubei Province is rich in mineral resources. In addition to the Daye Iron Mine, which has long been famous both domestically and internationally, coal mines in Yangda, Gui, Yi, and other counties are also being developed by numerous operators. In order to promote the development of the mining industry throughout the province, the department plans to establish a mineral resources survey team, following the example of other provinces, to conduct surveys. The survey area, survey methods, and budget have all been decided, as detailed below:</p>

<p>Refugees Disturb An Ting Town: On the 17th, a large number of refugees entered the county from Qingpu. The town's defense corps came forward to suppress them, providing relief in the form of over ten yuan in cash and some firewood and rice, which maintained relative stability. The next morning, they marched towards Wangxian Bridge, breaking into farmers' homes along the way and seizing firewood, chickens, ducks, and the like, causing great disturbance to the residents. After arriving in the town, they forcibly occupied schools and temples to live in. The Waigang Public Security Branch and the police team rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, and together with the local defense corps, ordered them to leave the territory. When they refused, after repeated negotiations, the police team hired boats to transport them out of the territory, which was finally completed on the 20th.</p>
<p>Credit Cooperative Provides Agricultural Loans: Because it is now the planting season and members are in great need of funds, the Wucun Credit Cooperative decided at a meeting to borrow 600 yuan from the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank to lend to farmers to provide relief. Loans have already begun to be issued, and members are crowding to borrow due to the convenient procedures and low interest rates.</p>

<p>Farmers Bank to Be Established: The county's Farmers Bank fund, which had been levied with the land tax long ago, has accumulated a considerable sum of money. It is currently renting premises on County Front Street to prepare for all aspects of the establishment, and it will soon open. It is rumored that Dai will be the manager.</p>
<p>Complaint Against Standing Committee Member of the Agricultural Consolidation Committee: Zhang Dehua, the former Standing Committee member of the County Agricultural Consolidation Committee, has been reported to the former Provincial Executive Committee by Wang Keming and other staff members of the committee because of his strong personality and near obstinacy.

<p>Application for Recusal in the Yang Case: In the case of Yang Chen Yunyu, who was previously abused by her husband's sister Yang Ruilan and hid and destroyed her dowry, causing her husband to file for divorce, the case has now been settled by the High Court, and they have reconciled.

Two hearings have been held, and Yang Ruilan was ordered to hand over the original items. Now it is known that Yang Ruilan, while in custody, hired a lawyer to draft an application for recusal and suspension of the case. The county government's ruling stated, "The petition is understood.

<p>Murderer of Her Own Husband Executed by Hanging: At 7:00 AM yesterday (the 21st), the High Court Prosecutor's Office executed the female prisoner Hu Li by hanging at the Third Sub-Prison. She was 26 years old and from Shengjiazhuang, Xinghua County. She and her husband, Hu Gaoqing, made a living by rowing a boat and collecting grass. The incident occurred on the night of March 21st, 1927, when she and her neighbor, Sheng Qifu (29 years old), were passionately in love and conspired to stab Hu to death with an iron fork and scissors and dumped the body in the river. After the case was uncovered, she was arrested and sent to the county government of that county, where she was sentenced to death. Hu Li and others were not convinced and appealed to the High Court here. After the second instance was rejected, they appealed again. After the third instance, the Supreme Court also ruled that she should be sentenced to death for premeditated murder. The High Court received the execution order and sent Prosecutor Zhu Wenzhuo, accompanied by Clerk Pang Shufeng, to verify her identity and carry out the execution according to law yesterday.</p>

<p>Provincial Mobile Lecture Team Arrives in Wuxi: The Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters organized a mobile lecture team, dividing it into two teams. The first team departed for the 28 counties in Jiangnan to conduct public propaganda. After departing on the 28th of last month, it has been warmly welcomed by the people everywhere.

The county propaganda department has actively prepared to hold a meeting in the auditorium of the Provincial Wuxi High School, and various schools will participate in recreational activities to increase audience interest. A notice has been sent to all sectors of society, inviting them to participate enthusiastically at that time.</p>
<p>Request to Investigate the Arsonist: Xu, a farmer from Xuxiang, near Zhangjing Bridge, Seventh District, Huai Township, is a carpenter by trade. He recently had a quarrel with his aunt, Guo.

<p>Black-Clad Bandits Rob Solitary Traveler: Xu Jinshu, the village deputy of Sujiacun, near Beizhu Town on the border of Wuxi and Cheng, was returning home from a wedding banquet in Beizhu Town at about 9:00 PM the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, when he reached the Huluduantou area less than ten steps from the town, he was suddenly stopped by several bandits dressed in black, speaking with a northern accent. They brandished weapons, forbade him to speak, and searched his entire body. He was robbed of seven yuan in cash, but the thirty-six yuan in banknotes were not taken, which can be considered fortunate.</p>
<p>Organization of a Rice Scarcity Relief Association: Since the beginning of spring, the price of rice in this county has gradually soared, causing panic among the general public. In recent days, due to the small amount of goods arriving and the depletion of stocks, the price of rice has increased sharply. However, unscrupulous merchants who seek profit are still secretly smuggling large quantities of rice out of the country in the hope of making huge profits. The price of high-quality white rice was 18 yuan the day before yesterday, and it rose sharply by seven corners yesterday. Tang Weizhi, a local resident, advocated organizing a rice scarcity relief association to properly plan emergency measures to address the root causes, given the daily rise in rice prices and the hardship of people's lives. He requested that fair merchants from Shanghai, together with fair merchants from the mainland and fair rice merchants from various places, organize it. All public funds accumulated from grain in various counties should be investigated and allocated, and those without cash should be handled separately for fair price sales and rotated on time until the new rice is harvested. If the above methods cannot be implemented in cooperation for the time being, please organize them separately in each county and gradually promote them. All farmers' banks in various places are established to facilitate farmers, and this matter should also imitate the social granary law, purchasing rice and lending it to farmers, and then repaying it at cost. It is hoped that people from all places will quickly join forces to plan and maintain, so that both people's food and security will benefit.</p>

<p>Kidnapping Case Occurs at Zhanwen Bridge: Miao Shouzheng of Zhanwen Bridge, Danan Township, twenty miles outside the east gate, was playing mahjong with friends on the night before last (the 19th) during a heavy rain when four bandits suddenly broke in over the wall and demanded 2,000 yuan in silver. Unsatisfied with what they received, they kidnapped Miao. Someone wanted to report to the defense corps, but there were more than ten bandits outside the door, so they dared not go out and listened as they went west. Afterwards, the defense corps pursued them to the south of Zhangqi Mountain, but found no trace of the bandits. This is the second kidnapping case in Jiangyin since the case at Wangjia Dai to Renji.</p>
<p>Judge Yang Interrogates Harboring Bandits: The Zhouzhuang Defense Corps went to Xiaobaifeng Village the day before yesterday to search for the notorious bandit Lu Zhanglin but failed to find him. They arrested the bandit Zhu Ruikun and Li Ruren, who was harboring the bandit and whose own daughter Li Zhangdi was raped. They were sent to the county the night before last, and yesterday (the 20th) afternoon, Judge Yang interrogated them in the inner court. According to Li Ruren, Lu Zhanglin had come several times from April to the present, and I was forced by his power, so I dared not report him. Li Zhangdi, 23 years old, testified that she had been betrothed to Xu Yongjiang of Zhongjia Alley two years ago. After entering the door, she divorced last year. In April of this year, Xiaogufu Liu Laowu came to my house with Lu Zhanglin and took a fancy to me. On the 20th of this month, Lu came with Qin Qirong and Wang Ziming and forced me to sleep with him. Because I was afraid of his gun, I was raped against my will, and I did not want to. Lu said to my father that he could take me as a concubine and promised my father 1,000 yuan, but my father did not want it either. On the day the defense corps came to arrest him, Lu heard the dogs barking and climbed up to the attic and fired a gun. After the corps members retreated, Lu escaped from the back door, etc. Zhu Ruikun testified that he was from Sanguanxinjing Bridge, a tailor by trade, making clothes in Yi's house and not a bandit. The rest of his testimony was evasive. After the interrogation, he ordered them to be taken into custody together for investigation and handling.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang Hears of Banditry in Yancheng: According to those who came to the province from Yancheng, the bandit situation in Yancheng has become increasingly rampant in recent days. Various towns and villages along the Binda Longitudinal Lake, such as Shajiazhuang, Linshangzhuang, Shuchengzhuang, Jiangying Town, Feijia Tuan, Anfeng Town, Luohubao, Meisongzhuang, Jianhekou, and Sheyang Town bordering Baoying, and Majiadang Qinggou and other places bordering Funing, have been repeatedly occupied, plundered, burned, killed, and raped by bandits, who have done everything imaginable. Nearly a hundred people have been kidnapped for ransom one after another. Civilian guns have been almost completely seized. In other areas such as Dagang Town in the south of the county, Nanbeiyang in the east of the county, Xinhe Temple Zhenggou in the west of the county, and Genkou in the north of the county, the situation of being robbed and plundered is no less than that of Xidang. There is almost no intact land in the entire county. At this time of busy farming, people cannot make a living, and inland rivers such as Wantai and other ferries have all stopped operating, traffic is cut off, and travel is difficult. If the province does not send heavy troops to thoroughly suppress them, the situation will inevitably spread to Jiangbei. It is hoped that the authorities will plan for this as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Another Banditry Incident in Gaozi: The First Regiment of the National Government Guard Brigade stationed in Zhenjiang received a telegram from Hu Yuanbo, the platoon leader of the Gaozi Station, stating that a gang of bandits had been discovered near the Gaozi Station, and gunfire had been incessant all night. He requested that troops be sent to assist in the defense and suppression. The First Battalion of the Regiment immediately dispatched the machine gun company commander Yuan Zhensheng, leading Platoon Leader Pan Yucheng and a platoon of box soldiers, to the area by small train at about 10:00 AM yesterday to assist in the suppression.</p>

<p>Provincial Order on Doorplate Fees: The Huaiyin Public Security Bureau previously planned to order city and rural doorplates and collect fees to raise funds for guns and ammunition, and submitted a document to the county government for review and approval. However, the various district offices in this county also needed funds for personnel registration, household census, and other matters, and had similar actions, making it difficult for the county government to handle. Therefore, the matter was forwarded to the Civil Affairs Department for instructions. A provincial order was received, allowing it to be handled within the territory of the First District, while other districts would be handled later. However, before the First District handles it, it should be appraised in accordance with the facts, and the collection procedures, compilation methods, income and expenditure budget, and future protection, relief, construction, and revision should be planned in detail and reported for verification and approval before being implemented. After receiving the order, the county government immediately issued a sub-order to each district office and the Public Security Bureau to comply with the provincial order regarding the reporting and verification. The Public Security Bureau was further instructed to plan in detail beforehand, formulate appropriate measures, and then discuss them at the upcoming district chief meeting before reporting them to the government for verification and approval.</p>

<p>Important News: Ministry of Education Order</p>
<h3 id="e85">Submit Rosters of Graduates from All Schools <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to all provincial education departments to submit rosters of graduates from all schools. The order reads:</p>
<p>The rosters of graduates from schools at all levels are of utmost importance for examining student qualifications. Students' admission to higher education, lawyer qualifications, doctor certifications, civil service examinations, and other matters often encounter difficulties due to qualification issues. Although the Ministry retains archives from the former Qing Dynasty Ministry of Education and the former Beijing Ministry of Education, which are sufficient for reference, the numerous volumes may have omissions. Therefore, a separate investigation should be conducted for verification purposes. In addition to issuing separate instructions, this order directs your department to investigate and submit rosters of graduates from all public and registered private secondary and higher education institutions within your jurisdiction, according to the format provided below. Alternatively, you may instruct each school to report in detail and submit the information to your department for compilation and forwarding to the Ministry for verification. This order includes the following nine items: (1) Name; (2) Gender; (3) Native place; (4) Department; (5) Class; (6) Graduation performance; (7) Graduation date; (8) Approving authority and date; (9) Remarks.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Guangdong Construction Department Promotes Waterborne Education <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>To Obtain Excellent Seamen and Sailors,</p>
<p>Attention Must First Be Paid to the Education of Tankas</p>
<p>(Guangzhou Correspondent) Deng Yanhua, Director of the Guangdong Construction Department, recently stated that the Tankas (boat people) living along the water are fellow citizens, yet they are almost like foreigners. Moreover, many drivers and sailors come from Tanka families. If they do not receive proper education, it will greatly affect the future of the nation. Yesterday (the 10th), he submitted a memorial to the provincial government requesting that the Education Department be instructed to pay attention to Tanka education. The original memorial reads: "Regarding the matter of submitting a petition, it is noted that Guangdong Province has numerous rivers and ports, and the shipping business is increasing daily. Consequently, the number of Tankas is also growing. Those of lower quality are familiar with water and skilled in handling boats. Those of average quality have some knowledge of shipping routes and specialize in piloting. Generally, they are crude by nature, live by the sea, and are difficult to manage and educate. Therefore, government agencies often let them be, resulting in the waterfront being almost like a foreign land. However, it is crucial to recognize that Guangdong Province is both a major trading area and a naval base. Many ship drivers and naval sailors come from Tanka families. If the foundation is poor, the results will be greatly affected. Seamen cannot compete with foreigners at sea, and sailors cannot serve the country effectively. Therefore, to obtain excellent seamen and sailors, attention must first be paid to the education of the Tanka people. However, navigation affairs are under the jurisdiction of the Construction Department, while education is the responsibility of the Education Department. To implement waterborne education, this document is submitted to your office, requesting that the Education Department be instructed to pay attention to the education of the Tanka people, so that they are not left out. Furthermore, please investigate the situation and promote waterborne schools to achieve universal education and cultivate talent. Whether this is appropriate is left for your wise decision. (June 12th)"</p>

<h3 id="e90">Jiangsu Teacher Certification for Party Principles Overwhelmed with Applications <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Provincial Teacher Certification Committee for Party Principles published its first announcement in the newspapers of Nanjing and Shanghai, the number of applicants has been overwhelming, almost too much to handle. It is understood that the committee is handling certification matters on a broad scale this time. In addition to directly certifying teachers of Party principles and deans of discipline in secondary schools throughout the province, provincial experimental primary schools, and individuals from various localities who are interested in teaching Party principles, it has also entrusted the training departments of the Party in various counties to jointly handle the certification of teachers of Party principles in primary schools with the education bureaus. In response to requests from various localities, the application period has been extended by one week to July 7. It is expected that the results of this certification will be more numerous than the previous one. The committee is also working on a solution for the future career paths of those who pass this certification as teachers of Party principles and deans of discipline.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Ministry of Education Strictly Orders Destruction of Classical Chinese Textbook Plates <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education is sparing no effort in banning textbooks in classical Chinese. Previously, the Shanghai Special Municipal Education Bureau reported the results of its investigation into the issuance of elementary school textbooks in classical Chinese by various bookstores and instructed the bureau that, despite the bookstores claiming to have no remaining stock and having ceased distribution, books in classical Chinese from Zhonghua, Shijie, Shangwu, and Guomin bookstores could still be purchased when the Ministry sent people to Beijing. This showed that the bookstores' claims of having no remaining stock and having voluntarily stopped selling were lies. The bureau should be instructed to warn them. As for the printing aspect, since all the bookstores claimed to have stopped printing, all the stone printing templates and paper boards for various elementary school textbooks in classical Chinese have become waste. To prevent further unauthorized printing, the education bureau should promptly send personnel to inspect them one by one, seal them all up, and submit a detailed list to the Ministry so that it can send personnel to supervise their destruction or transport them to designated museums, educational halls, and other places for display. The above points should be complied with and a report submitted promptly. Subsequently, the bureau requested a change to the method of banning elementary school textbooks in classical Chinese for the Shanghai Shangwu Library, and a temporary delay in the destruction of paper molds and printing plates was approved. The Ministry instructed that this should not be discussed and simultaneously instructed the education departments of the three northeastern provinces, Guangdong, and Fujian to instruct primary schools not to use textbooks in classical Chinese thereafter. The two orders are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Instructions to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Your report has been noted. This Ministry, in order to ban elementary school textbooks in classical Chinese, issued a circular to seal up the paper molds and printing plates of these books. All bookstores have complied. The library should not be unique. The vernacular textbooks for elementary schools in the three northeastern provinces and Guangdong and Fujian provinces are also widely used. If a small number of schools still use elementary school textbooks in classical Chinese privately, the local education authorities have not provided sufficient guidance and should be instructed by this Ministry to earnestly provide guidance and prohibit them. Although the situation in Nanyang (Southeast Asia) is different, most important locations such as Singapore, the Philippines, and Java use vernacular textbooks. For those who stubbornly insist on using elementary school textbooks in classical Chinese, the Ministry should still instruct the consuls and consult with the Central Propaganda Department to instruct the Party branches at all levels overseas to provide guidance and prohibit them, so as to thoroughly implement this Ministry's plan to ban elementary school textbooks in classical Chinese. The Shanghai Library's request for a temporary postponement of the sealing up of paper molds and printing plates for elementary school textbooks in classical Chinese should not be discussed. In addition to instructing the education departments of the three northeastern provinces, Fujian, and Guangdong, and the consuls stationed abroad, and consulting with the Central Propaganda Department, this order directs your bureau to instruct the library to acknowledge this.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Order to the Education Departments of the Three Northeastern Provinces, Guangdong, and Fujian <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>This Ministry, in order to ban elementary school textbooks in classical Chinese, previously issued a circular to all provincial and municipal education administrative organs, instructing all bookstores to seal up all paper molds and printing plates of these books. Now, the Shanghai bookstores report that the three northeastern provinces and Fujian and Guangdong provinces still use elementary school textbooks in classical Chinese and request permission to temporarily postpone the sealing up of these paper molds and printing plates to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants. This Ministry has found that vernacular textbooks for elementary schools have long been in circulation in these provinces. Why are there still schools using classical Chinese textbooks? If this is the case, it is due to lax enforcement and insufficient guidance. This order directs you to instruct all primary schools under your jurisdiction not to use classical Chinese textbooks thereafter in order to promote education and emphasize decrees. In addition to instructing the bookstores that their request should not be discussed and issuing separate instructions, this order directs you to comply and not delay.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Teacher Certification Committee for Party Principles, considering that the two-year validity period of the previously certified teachers of Party principles is about to expire, and in order to alleviate the shortage of talent, submitted a request to the central government and the Ministry of Education to extend the validity period. The Ministry of Education also requested instructions from the central government. It is heard that the central government is currently drafting new measures for certifying teachers of Party principles and will announce them soon.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Subsidizing the High School Expenses of Zhejiang University <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Provincial Funds to Be Allocated from 1930 Onward for Maintenance</p>
<p>Five Articles Establishing Methods for Subsidizing Expenses</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department believes that the establishment of high schools affiliated with the Agricultural and Engineering Colleges of Zhejiang University hinders the university's own development. It has decided to cease enrollment starting in 1930 and close them down gradually. The department believes that this reduces the opportunity to cultivate practical talents, which is contrary to the needs of industrial education in the province and the resolutions of the National Education Conference. Therefore, it has drafted a proposal and established five articles for subsidizing expenses, which were submitted to the provincial government for review. The proposal was approved by the 319th committee meeting yesterday. The original text of the proposal is as follows: The chairman has successively received a document from Gu Yuxiu, professor of the Engineering College of National Zhejiang University, stating four reasons why the industrial program of the high school affiliated with the Engineering College should not be stopped immediately, and requesting that a way be found to maintain it. Also received was a document from Liu Dexiang, a graduate of the former Zhejiang Provincial Class A Industrial School, stating that the industrial school has been operating successfully and requesting that a way be found to maintain it if it is to be closed down. The chairman instructed the Education Department to review and respond. Zhejiang University also sent a letter stating that the high-level industrial high school affiliated with the Engineering College and the high-level agricultural high school affiliated with the Agricultural College have been operating for many years with considerable success. However, the university's funding is insufficient, and the affiliated high schools require significant expenses, which hinder the university's own development. The colleges have been instructed to cease enrollment and close down gradually starting in 1930. The Engineering College has submitted a report stating that it has complied with the order to cease enrollment and close down gradually, and has submitted five Su Miqian's leveling instruments, which were transferred by the former principal of the Engineering College, for verification and cancellation. Please verify and respond. The high-level agricultural and industrial high schools affiliated with the Agricultural and Engineering Colleges of Zhejiang University were originally vocational schools affiliated with the Zhejiang Provincial Public Agricultural and Industrial Specialized Schools. When the agricultural and industrial specialized schools were reorganized into the Agricultural and Engineering Colleges of National Zhejiang University, the affiliated vocational schools were also reorganized into affiliated high-level high schools. Now, Zhejiang University, due to funding issues, will stop enrolling new students in the affiliated high schools in 1930, which means that Zhejiang will have one less institution for cultivating practical talents. Industrial education in Zhejiang is not well-developed. There are still no provincial agricultural and industrial schools. There are only Ningbo Municipal Industrial High School and Qu County and Jiangshan Private Agricultural Vocational Schools among the city and county private vocational schools. Agricultural and industrial schools cannot be compared to ordinary schools. Their farms, factories, and laboratories require various equipment that cannot be set up and perfected overnight. The former provincial agricultural and industrial schools have been operating for more than ten years before they can achieve some success. The society has a great need for agricultural and industrial talents, as evidenced by the situation of graduates from these schools in the past. If the high schools affiliated with the Agricultural and Engineering Colleges of Zhejiang University are closed down, there will be a sudden shortage of such talents, which will not be enough to meet the actual needs of society. Furthermore, the "Improvement Plan for National Education," resolved at the Second National Education Conference, called for the separate establishment of more agricultural and industrial high schools during the period of political tutelage, or the conversion of ordinary high schools. Due to financial constraints, this province has not been able to plan for this this year. However, it is necessary to continue to maintain the existing agricultural and industrial high schools affiliated with the Agricultural and Engineering Colleges of Zhejiang University. Based on the above reasons, five articles for subsidizing the expenses of the high schools affiliated with the Agricultural and Engineering Colleges of Zhejiang University are proposed as follows: (1) It is requested that the high schools affiliated with the Agricultural and Engineering Colleges of Zhejiang University continue to enroll new students starting in 1930. (2) The high schools affiliated with the Agricultural and Engineering Colleges of Zhejiang University will be subsidized by the Zhejiang Provincial Government at a rate of 4,000 silver dollars per class per year for the new students enrolled after 1930, based on the number of classes, and paid monthly from the provincial treasury. However, each class of new students must have at least 20 students. Those with fewer than 20 students will be placed in other departments and will not be opened as separate classes. (3) The Agricultural and Engineering Colleges of Zhejiang University should report the number of new students and new classes established in each affiliated high school to the Zhejiang Provincial Education Department at the beginning of each academic year. (4) The Agricultural and Engineering Colleges of Zhejiang University should report the income and expenditure of the regular and temporary expenses of the affiliated high schools to the Zhejiang Provincial Education Department for reference at the end of each semester. (5) The Zhejiang Provincial Education Department should send personnel to inspect the high schools affiliated with the Agricultural and Engineering Colleges of Zhejiang University at least twice each semester and report the results of the inspection to the provincial government. Whether the above measures are feasible is submitted for public deliberation.</p>

<p>Each county government in Zhejiang Province has a radio receiver for transmitting urgent official business and various news. However, because most of the operators lack technical expertise, the effectiveness is weak. The Zhejiang Construction Department previously ordered each county to send qualified personnel to Hangzhou in batches for training and instructed the construction personnel training institute to open a radio class to teach practical subjects and skills so that they can competently handle radio reception and repair. The first batch of students completed their training course last week. Those who passed the rigorous examination were given certificates and assigned to work at radio stations in various counties. It is also heard that the institute plans to recruit another 120 engineering students to be assigned to various affiliated construction agencies after graduation.</p>

<p>The entire faculty and staff of the National Labor University are extremely indignant at the Ministry of Education's sudden order to halt enrollment at the university and undermine labor education, which is a bizarre event. They have repeatedly elected representatives to host members of the press from Beijing and Shanghai to announce the true facts and oppose the Ministry of Education, as previously reported. Last night, they also hosted a banquet for prominent members of the Shanghai academic community at the Hua An Building. Attendees included He Bingsong, Jiang Wenyu, Zheng Hongnian, Dong Renjian, Zheng Tonghe, and Jin Wensi. During the banquet, the guests and hosts exchanged opinions. Xiong Renan and others from the faculty and staff of Labor University put forward four key points: (1) The Ministry of Education has always specialized in undermining university education institutions without providing assistance. The order to halt enrollment at Labor University without cause is just one example. (2) Labor University is the highest institution of labor education in the country and has the mission of cultivating specialized talents and developing agricultural and industrial education. The Ministry of Education has not only never provided guidance but has also blamed the university for "labor not being associated with universities," showing that the Ministry of Education does not understand the meaning of labor education. (3) Labor University currently has more than a thousand students, mostly from poor classes who are hardworking, resilient, diligent, and eager to learn. The Ministry of Education's action is tantamount to depriving these young people of the opportunity to study and treating university education as the exclusive property of the capitalist class. (4) The Ministry of Education's personnel sent to inspect the school had preconceived notions. Therefore, they did not hesitate to fabricate charges to achieve their plan to destroy Labor University. All the guests believed that the Ministry of Education's handling was inappropriate and expressed deep sympathy for the school. They also expressed their willingness to uphold justice and provide appropriate assistance.</p>

Finally, the proposals submitted by various industry associations were discussed. Xu Jilu of the presidium delivered the closing remarks, and the meeting adjourned at 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered the opening remarks, saying: The reasons for convening this general meeting of trade association representatives today have already been stated in detail in the application to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and have been published in the local newspapers. I believe everyone has already seen it. However, according to the usual meeting order, there is an item for opening remarks, so I will briefly reiterate. Originally, this committee was ordered to be established in May of last year. According to Article 15 of the organizational outline prescribed by the central government, "The Commercial Consolidation Committee shall be abolished when the unified organization is established after the promulgation of the unified organization laws and regulations." Therefore, from this point of view, this committee is a preparatory committee for unifying merchant organizations, or, to put it simply, a preparatory committee for the "Shanghai Chamber of Commerce." However, the planned consolidation period of this committee was originally thought to be a few months or half a year. Why has it taken more than a year to prepare? There are several reasons for this. First, the laws and regulations promulgated by the central government require a great deal of review and consideration. The Chamber of Commerce Law was promulgated on August 15, 1929, the implementing regulations for the Chamber of Commerce Law were promulgated on November 13, and the implementing regulations for the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law were promulgated on January 7, 1930. The order of the Central Executive Committee to end the various local merchant-civilian associations was not promulgated until February 10, 1930. Before the central government had unified merchant organization laws and regulations, this committee could not start work. Second, to unify the organization, it was necessary to change and reorganize the previously ununified merchant organizations first. The initial step in the reorganization was registration. The registration of merchant organizations in this city was originally a pioneering undertaking, so at the beginning, some organizations simply did not pay attention to it and did not take it seriously. Some organizations simply had misunderstandings, so it was necessary to extend the deadline for registration to the end of October. The second step was reorganization. The meaning of reorganization is to transform illegal organizations into legal organizations, and to merge organizations of the same nature that should be merged according to law. However, each industry organization has its own long history and separate relationships. In the past, they were used to being left alone. Once the laws and regulations promulgated by the central government were seriously implemented, there were bound to be many difficulties. Therefore, there were even cases where public documents requesting reconsideration of the change of name of a trade association were received three or four times in a row. The difficulties encountered in reorganizing and merging organizations according to law were naturally even greater. Fortunately, the central government and the municipal party and government organs presided over and guided from above, and the various industry organizations gradually understood the true meaning of the reorganization by this committee, so they were still able to complete the procedures for preparing the municipal chamber of commerce within a year. On the one hand, this allowed this committee to live up to the mission of the central government, and on the other hand, it organized merchant organizations according to law. When the whole country is calculated, Shanghai is still the first success, and it is considered not to have failed Shanghai's consistently advanced status in all matters. On behalf of all the members of this committee, I should express my sincere gratitude. This is the meaning of today's meeting.</p>
<p>Report of the General Meeting The Chairman reported, "The meaning of today's meeting has just been explained by Chairman Yu. Now, I will report on the results of the registration and reorganization handled by this committee. The tasks of this committee, in accordance with Article 3 of the organizational outline of this committee, which was revised and approved by the 14th Standing Committee meeting of the Central Committee on May 23, 1929, are stipulated as (1) registering the members of the former Shanghai Merchant-Civilian Association, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Zhabei Chamber of Commerce, and Nanshi Chamber of Commerce; (2) drafting the charter of the unified organization according to laws and regulations; (3) preparing all organizational procedures for the unified organization. Article 5 of the same outline stipulates that other local merchant organization matters may be guided by this committee in accordance with laws and regulations. Now, on behalf of this committee, I will report the progress of various matters to all representatives. First, is the registration issue. The organizational outline of this committee stipulates that the registration method shall be determined separately, so after the establishment of this committee, it drafted registration regulations and submitted them to the central government for approval and implemented the registration. For the final deadline, this committee also issued a notice in conjunction with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters Public Education Committee, stating that registration is an indispensable procedure for all commercial organizations in the city. If it is not done by the deadline, not only will requests submitted thereafter not be accepted, but there will also be grounds for banning and dissolving them. In total, 261 organizations were registered throughout the city. By analysis, 71 previously belonged to the Merchant-Civilian Association, 77 belonged to the General Chamber of Commerce, 3 belonged to the Zhabei Chamber of Commerce, 32 belonged to the Nanshi Chamber of Commerce, 56 had not previously joined the four merchant organizations, and 18 were special organizations (i.e., hometown organizations and national goods united organizations, etc.). This is the first item of this committee's task regarding the handling of registration matters that can be reported. Second, is drafting the charter of the unified organization according to laws and regulations. Since the promulgation of the Chamber of Commerce Law, this committee, at its 7th plenary meeting on August 28, 1929, appointed Wang Xiaolai, Lu Fengzhu, Xu Jilu, Fang Jiaobo, Yan Esheng, Lu Qisheng, Qin Runqing, and others as members of the Chamber of Commerce charter drafting committee. After the Ministry of Industry and Commerce promulgated the implementing regulations for the Chamber of Commerce Law, they immediately started drafting. At the same time, the committee repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to promptly promulgate the implementing regulations for the Chamber of Commerce Law. It was not until January of this year that the implementing regulations for the Chamber of Commerce Law were issued by the Ministry. The drafting committee then drafted the full text of the draft, totaling 11 chapters and 60 articles. It was passed by the 10th plenary meeting on February 22 of this year and sent to the Social Affairs Bureau for submission to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. On May 16, the Social Affairs Bureau replied, stating that the draft charter had been revised and submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval. Except for the proportional method of collecting membership fees, which was drafted in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce Law, all other cases were handled in accordance with the revised draft. It was further resolved at the 51st Standing Committee meeting on May 19 that the proportional method of collecting membership fees would be discussed and decided at the general meeting of members' representatives, and all other items would be revised and sent to the Social Affairs Bureau for record. This charter, which has been submitted for approval and record, will be read out article by article, except for the article on membership fees, which will be discussed as a separate proposal. This is the second item of this committee's task regarding drafting the charter of the unified organization that can be reported. Third, is preparing all organizational procedures for the unified organization. To complete the organization of the unified organization, it is necessary to thoroughly reorganize the registered organizations. As the name suggests, this is also the most important part of the responsibility borne by this committee. However, the premise of reorganization is "according to law." This committee can use the following to guide various organizations in reorganization: (1) the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law promulgated by the National Government; (2) the implementing regulations for the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law promulgated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; (3) the reorganization rules submitted by this committee for approval; (4) the reorganization and organizational procedures submitted by this committee for approval; and the approval orders of the Central Executive Committee, the Central Training Department, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Municipal Government for various organizational and reorganization issues. The most important aspects of the reorganization method are two points: A. All organizations in the city that do not have the same organization, regardless of whether they previously used the names guild hall, association, public association, branch, or joint association, shall change their names to a certain industry trade association of the Shanghai Special Municipality or a certain industry trade association of the Shanghai Special Municipality in accordance with Article 1 of the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law. B. If there are more than one organization in the city in the same industry, the number of reorganization committee members that each organization should recommend shall be determined by this committee according to the proportion of the number of members of each organization. These organizations should organize an industry organization reorganization committee to carry out the reorganization and establish the industry trade association within a time limit. If the organization cannot recommend reorganization committee members, this committee will investigate the central figures of the organization and appoint them. In addition to the above-mentioned reorganized and merged organizations, there are also organizations that request new organization. This committee has also followed the organizational plan of people's organizations promulgated by the National Government and the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law to guide their legal organization. In total, the number of reorganized, merged, and newly organized industry trade associations is 170. By analysis, 140 were reorganized, 58 were merged into 23, and 7 were newly organized. In addition to the above-mentioned various organizations, there are also (1) 17 organizations with fluidity; (2) 8 stallholder organizations; (3) 3 joint organizations of more than one industry; (4) 12 joint organizations above the regional level; (5) 10 organizations with a regional scope; (6) 5 national goods united organizations; (7) 7 hometown organizations; (8) 5 organizations with stallholder organizations and regional characteristics; (9) 1 organization that requested cancellation; (10) 1 organization that the Social Affairs Bureau instructed not to reorganize; and (11) 1 organization that was virtually suspended. The above total of 66 organizations are not in the reorganization list. Except for the three organizations that requested cancellation, were virtually suspended, and were instructed by the Social Affairs Bureau not to reorganize, the reasons for not reorganizing all other organizations are: A. Although this committee has stated the reasons for the organizations of fluid stallholders to organize, the Central Training Department and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce have replied that they believe that they cannot organize industry trade associations according to law and should be dissolved immediately. B. Joint organizations of more than one industry and national goods united organizations should be sent to the Legislative Yuan to formulate separate regulations in accordance with the resolution of the 55th meeting of the Executive Yuan this year and are not within the scope of the Chamber of Commerce Law. C. Joint organizations above the regional level, organizations with a regional scope, and hometown organizations all have the characteristics of being based on local units and do not meet the qualifications of members of the Chamber of Commerce in Article 9 of the Chamber of Commerce Law. According to the instructions of the Central Training Department No. 2255, they should join various industry trade associations according to their nature and do not need to be stipulated separately. Of course, they cannot join the Chamber of Commerce. In addition, there is another issue that should be reported incidentally, that is, since the National Government promulgated the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law, should the industry trade associations in this city that were organized according to the separate charters promulgated by the competent ministries in the past be reorganized according to law? The Standing Committee of this committee also resolved to submit it to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for verification. Subsequently, it received the approval of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce No. 8929, stating that all industrial and commercial enterprises in the Republic of China should abide by the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law promulgated by the National Government. Separate charters should be judged by whether they conflict with this law, etc. This committee has followed this approval order and has notified various associations organized according to separate charters to reorganize according to law. The above points are the third item of this committee's task, preparing all organizational procedures for the unified organization, that can be reported. The third task of this committee has now been reported. There are still two things that should be reported. The first is the number of member representatives who reported to the general meeting. It has been reported above that there are 170 industry trade associations with a common law. At this session of the general meeting of members' representatives, the number of industry trade associations that have recommended representatives is currently 142, which is calculated to be more than two-thirds. The total number of representatives recommended by the organizations is 346. In addition, shop members, according to the Chamber of Commerce Law, are limited to those in the city who do not have the same industry or who have the same industry but do not have an industry trade association. However, the so-called those who have the same industry but do not have an industry trade association, does the interpretation refer to those who have can legally organize an industry trade association (i.e., must have seven or more firms in the same industry) but do not want to organize or have not yet organized, or is it limited to those who have less than seven firms in the same industry and cannot legally organize an industry trade association? There are no clear provisions in the laws and regulations, so the first representative qualification review committee of this committee, when it met on the 17th of this month, used the first type, those who have can legally organize an industry trade association but do not want to organize or have not yet organized, as the review standard. On the morning of the 18th, it received the approval order of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce No. 10894, which stated that the so-called those who have the same industry but do not have an industry trade association mentioned in Article 6 of the Chamber of Commerce Law refers to those who have less than seven firms in the same industry in the same area. If there are seven or more firms, they should immediately organize an industry trade association according to law, and the association should send representatives to join the Chamber of Commerce. The provisions of shop members in that article cannot be applied to conform to the legal system and avoid disputes, etc. In accordance with this approval order, there are clear restrictions on shop members. This committee then convened the second meeting of the member qualification review committee on the 19th to review again. As a result of the review, there were 19 shop members who were deemed qualified by the first review committee meeting but conflicted with the approval order of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. They were immediately informed to withdraw from membership and the prepaid attendance fee was returned. Now, there are 10 shop members who have been re-examined and qualified, totaling 23 representatives. Together with the organization member representatives, the total is 369 member representatives. This should be reported as one. The second item, Article 49 of the Chamber of Commerce charter stipulates that the fund for the public bonds issued by this committee should be increased by 30% according to the amount of membership fees until the public bonds are repaid. This fund should be kept by a separate custody committee. The collection of attendance fees at this session of the general meeting of representatives is also based on this charter, with an increase of 30%, which is 15 yuan for organization member representatives and 9 yuan for shop member representatives. Except for the public bond fund custody committee, which should be organized separately after the executive and supervisory committee members of the Chamber of Commerce are elected, all public bonds that should be repaid should be reported separately below: (A) The former General Chamber of Commerce construction public bonds. According to the 23rd meeting of the board of directors of the General Chamber of Commerce on November 28, 1916, the construction of the meeting hall and office buildings of this association has been completed successively. The construction cost is still huge in addition to donations and fundraising, and it has all been borrowed. It is urgent to raise funds to repay the debt. In addition, the case of preparing for the product exhibition hall was unanimously advocated for construction, but there was no way to prepare for the construction. It was resolved that the insufficient funds for the construction of the meeting hall and the construction funds for the exhibition hall should be raised by issuing public bonds to offset the debt. For the repayment of principal and interest, 30% should be added to the membership fees as a fund. Subsequently, at the 24th meeting of the board of directors on December 2 of the same year, it was resolved to raise 80,000 taels of debt, print 1,600 bonds, each worth 50 taels, and repay the principal and interest in twelve years. In addition to those that have been repaid, there is currently an outstanding debt of 17,576 taels, 1 mace, and 6 candareens. (B) The former General Chamber of Commerce reorganization public bonds. According to the first meeting of the board of directors on January 4, 1926, during the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War in 1925, troops gathered, supplying grain and fodder, supporting scattered soldiers, and taking over the Shanghai Arsenal, which cost a lot. In addition, after the May 30th Massacre occurred, the stalemate lasted for a long time, donations from all parties gradually dried up, and the expenses for the Yarn Factory workers to start work subsidies and seafarer relief were all temporarily borrowed and gathered by the association. Except for those borrowed from the government with evidence, the remaining short-term borrowings have no collateral. The lunar New Year is approaching in an instant, and all must be repaid to maintain credit. The precedent of the former construction public bonds was followed to issue reorganization public bonds of 100,000 taels, each worth 100 taels. The construction public bonds will be deducted until the end of the 17th year, and the 30% fund after the construction public bonds are repaid will still be used to pay the principal and interest of this public bond, which will be repaid in twelve years. The current outstanding debt on this bond is 138,209 taels. (C) The former Shanghai South Chamber of Commerce construction public bonds. In 1924, the old meeting hall in Maojia Lane was not sufficient for office work, so the board of directors resolved to build a new meeting hall. The former chairman Yao Ziruo and vice chairman Yao Mulian were responsible for preparing. First, more than 40,000 taels were accumulated to purchase more than four acres of open space on Zhonghua Road, Xiaonanmen. Drawings were made and construction was estimated, and it was estimated that at least 150,000 yuan would be needed. The board of directors also discussed in detail and decided to follow the example of the General Chamber of Commerce construction public bonds to issue former Shanghai County Chamber of Commerce construction public bonds worth 60,000 taels of standard silver, with each ticket worth 100 taels, totaling 600 tickets, with an annual interest rate of 9%, to be repaid in ten years. The interest was paid only in the first period, and the principal and interest were paid from the second period. The end of June in the Gregorian calendar each year was the date for repaying the principal and interest. It was supposed to be repaid in full by 1935. Since being ordered to merge in May of the 18th year, the repayment of principal and interest has been delayed by two periods. The current outstanding debt on this bond is 60,576 taels, 6 mace, and 3 candareens. The total outstanding debt on the above three public bonds is 216,361 taels, 7 mace, and 9 candareens. Except for the former Shanghai South Chamber of Commerce construction public bonds, which still have rental income to offset the bonds, the remaining former General Chamber of Commerce construction public bonds and reorganization public bonds should all be repaid in installments from the 30% fee attached. This should be reported as two. The above reports total five items, but they only cover the most important ones. As for the detailed report of this committee's work, it will be compiled into a special book after the committee's work is completed and distributed to all members and representatives for review.</p>
<p>Admonitory Speech by the Central Representative Everyone, Shanghai is a commercial center, and the organization of commercial organizations has always been complex and uneconomical. This time, the Consolidation Committee was ordered to reorganize the commercial organizations in this city. It took a year to complete the reorganization. Although it has not been completed for all industries and organizations in the city, the spirit has already been unified. Shanghai is the most important commercial port in the country. To develop the national industrial and commercial undertakings, it is natural to start from Shanghai. Therefore, the establishment of a unified organization today is a very good thing. I am very honored to participate in this general meeting of representatives. The Chamber of Commerce is the leading organization of commercial organizations in the city and bears a great mission. I hope that everyone will work together to promote the development of industry and commerce and realize it. The Premier also had a plan to develop industrial and commercial undertakings. The Third National Congress has a resolution to implement it. Measures to improve products, promote domestic goods, and inspect products are all aimed at breaking down obstacles to industry and commerce and seeking their development. Today, the Chamber of Commerce is established. I still hope that everyone will work together to assist in the completion of a good commercial organization to serve as an example and provide great assistance to the government.</p>
<p>Admonitory Speech by the Representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters Everyone, today all the representatives are here to participate. I think everyone understands that they bear a heavy responsibility. Why does Shanghai have such an organization to reorganize merchant organizations? Because the central government hopes that Shanghai will have a sound merchant organization to help the government develop industry and commerce. In the past, merchants had a saying "in business, speak of business."</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>In fact, these four words are a fallacy that merchants have no national concept. We hope that after the Chamber of Commerce is established in the future, it will rise up to seek more welfare for merchants and develop industrial and commercial undertakings. However, to seek industrial and commercial development, the first point should be to maintain the original industrial and commercial enterprises. Now, the leather, soap, match, shipping, silk, and satin industries are gradually declining. The original industrial and commercial enterprises cannot be maintained, so how can we seek development? Therefore, to develop industrial and commercial enterprises, we must first maintain the original enterprises. Therefore, we hope that the Chamber of Commerce should pay attention to this first. The second point is the unemployment problem. The pharmaceutical industry turmoil this year is that the unemployment problem has affected various drugstores and prevented them from opening for business. Therefore, to develop industrial and commercial enterprises, we must first solve the unemployment problem. The third point is that the majority of our country's people are poor. At least 100 million people have an income of less than 130 yuan per year. Due to the livelihood of the poor, goods cannot be sold as much as possible. Even if industrial and commercial enterprises want to develop, there is no way to solve the problem thoroughly. The fourth point is that industrial and commercial undertakings cannot develop if the situation cannot be peaceful and unified. The fifth point is the economic aggression of foreign merchants. Foreign merchants have developed commerce in China, such as banks, shipping, and yarn factories, occupying the largest force in Shanghai. Chinese commerce and finance are only 600 million yuan, and foreign merchants account for half of it. There are the above five reasons, so to break through the difficulties of industrial and commercial enterprises, there should be a sound organization to assist the government and find ways to remedy the situation. If these five problems cannot be solved, our country's industrial and commercial enterprises are a dead end. In the past, the Chamber of Commerce only focused on dealing with officialdom and neglected the development of commerce. Now, the most important responsibility of the Chamber of Commerce is to make the development of industrial and commercial enterprises the first priority.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Official Instructions from the National Government's Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and the Municipal Government Representative <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Just now, the representative from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Mr. Zhao Jinqing, has left, entrusting me to represent him. Therefore, today I represent the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Today, those participating in this conference include representatives from various party and government organs, who have already delivered excellent and detailed speeches. I could have remained silent, but regarding how to develop China's industry and commerce, Comrade Tao has already spoken, and I have some supplementary ideas to offer to you all. I ask for your attention. Comrade Tao said that China's only way out is to develop industry and commerce, and to develop industry and commerce, the five obstacles he mentioned must be completely overcome. To overcome these obstacles, one must understand that nothing in the world can be achieved without effort. The mentality of attributing success to luck and relying on fate must be completely eradicated. To achieve something, one must have the necessary strength. In the past, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce could not shoulder this mission. The most significant reason was the flawed organizational structure. Because the previous Chamber of Commerce was based on individuals. Someone joining the Chamber of Commerce meant they were a respectable merchant. Everyone was focused on themselves, not on industry and commerce. Therefore, they could not accomplish anything. Now, the focus is on the industry itself. The Chamber of Commerce is a united organization of various industrial and commercial guilds, based on industry and commerce. This point should be clear to everyone. Everyone here is a representative of the members, not just a member. Just now, the chairman reported that the merger of all 170 organizations in Shanghai into the Chamber of Commerce has been resolved. From now on, we will jointly develop China's industry and commerce. As long as everyone is willing to work hard, the country's industry and commerce can be saved. Because Shanghai is the most important place for industry and commerce, the place with the most power. If Shanghai's industrialists and merchants can shoulder this responsibility, the whole country will have a solution. The disunity and lack of peace that Comrade Tao mentioned are also obstacles to the development of industry and commerce. If these obstacles are not resolved, industry and commerce cannot develop. How can industry and commerce develop when there is fighting? Everyone knows, when did England's industry and commerce flourish? It was after Elizabeth unified England. Under a unified government, England's industrial and commercial enterprises could flourish. Similarly, Germany did so after Prussia established the German Confederation, and Japan did so after the Meiji Restoration. It can be seen that no country in the world has been able to develop industry and commerce under a disunified government. Now, in Tianjin, Yan Xishan has put a foreign rogue in charge of the customs as a customs commissioner. The National Government's response is to order the closure of Tianjin Customs. This approach causes suffering for our merchants. Goods that were shipped to Tianjin for export now have to be transported back. Merchants suffer from this, and those who do not understand the situation will surely blame the Nanjing government. In reality, they are suffering because of Yan Xishan. Similarly, if bandits cause trouble inland, there are still solutions within the National Government's territory. However, if it is within the territory controlled by the rebellious army, there is no solution. Therefore, to develop the country's industry and commerce, we must use our entire strength to seek national peace and unification, and not just treat the symptoms without addressing the root cause. For example, the rebels of Yan and Feng rely on money to cause chaos. We must at least cut off their economic supply so that unification can be hoped for. Only when unification is in sight can we plan for the development of industry and commerce. My supplementary idea to Comrade Tao is that we must first unify the political situation before we can develop industry and commerce. Therefore, I hope that everyone will work together to promote unification and develop industry and commerce. At the same time, I would like to report to everyone present that the Chamber of Commerce Preparatory Committee received a telegram from the National Government's Secretariat today, appointing Mayor Zhang to represent the National Government to address the meeting. Mayor Zhang is too busy with official duties, so he sent me to attend. This is a combined statement.</p>
<p>The representative of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce said briefly, "I am honored to attend and participate today on behalf of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce. In the past, the General Chamber of Commerce had a glorious history, and it was the beginning of the Chamber of Commerce in China, established in the seventeenth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, which is now thirty years ago. However, these thirty years have been through many storms. Today, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is established. I hope that all of you present will be able to invigorate your spirits and seek benefits for commerce. The last sentence is that there is the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, then the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and then the Chamber of Commerce Law. Please pay attention to this."</p>
<p>Chairman's Closing Remarks: Chairman Xu Jiqing said in his closing remarks, "Under the guidance of the Party, the merchants have a unified organization for a grand gathering. Not to mention that it is a groundbreaking event in this city, I am afraid it is also a groundbreaking event in the whole country. Therefore, although today's conference has ended, its value is indelible and will always be worth remembering. From another perspective, today's gathering of members is the beginning of a new life for merchants. Therefore, when I am about to conclude this meeting, on the one hand, I would like to thank the party and government organs and all the guests for their presence and guidance on behalf of all the members of the general assembly. On the other hand, I also hope that from today onwards, all members will make unremitting efforts. Time is short, and I cannot say more. I hope you will understand."</p>

<p>Mayor Zhang's</p>
<h3 id="e117">Important Remarks on the Current Situation <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, reporters from various newspapers went to the Municipal Government to meet Mayor Zhang and inquire about the current situation. Mayor Zhang graciously received them. The following is the conversation between the reporters and Mayor Zhang. Reporter asked (hereinafter referred to as ask): Japanese newspapers reported that Mayor Zhang visited Mr. Yu Youren to conduct peace talks. Is this true? Mr. Zhang replied (hereinafter referred to as reply): Mr. Yu has been ill recently, so I don't see him often. When we do meet, we just have casual conversations. The reports are completely unfounded. (Ask): Japanese newspapers have been spreading similar rumors recently. What is the reason for this? (Reply): This kind of provocative, divisive, and schadenfreude behavior does not seem like the national character of the Japanese people. However, the reason why they must do this must be related to other factors. They have to act as propaganda for the reactionaries. For example, Japanese newspapers have twice reported that Mr. Zhang Jingjiang is working for peace, and recently they said that Yang Hucheng and Xu Yuanquan have rebelled. In fact, all of these are unfounded. Everyone knows this. Such dishonest behavior is just deceiving themselves. There is no need for me to say anything more. I remember that Mr. Yamada, the Japanese Minister to China during the late Qing Dynasty, once said that what harms the friendly relations between China and Japan is the frivolousness of newspaper reporters' remarks. Duke Ito also said that newspaper reporters should be responsible for the order and chaos of the world. These unconscious newspaper reporters cannot comprehend the famous sayings of the sages. I really think this is the biggest flaw of mankind and should be despised by the discerning. We should jointly correct this and sanction it so that the few people with ulterior motives will disappear from now on, in order to enhance the friendly relations between China and Japan. (Ask): Japanese newspapers reported from Beiping that Yan Xishan has returned to Taiyuan with important officials, and that the headquarters will also be moved from Shijiazhuang. When the war is urgent, why doesn't he go to the front to supervise the army, but instead retreats? (Reply): Yan's rebellion this time was forced by the environment and may not have been his original intention. When the war began, Yan had a total of 64 regiments, about 90,000 men. Because Feng was responsible for military affairs and Yan himself was responsible for political affairs, Yan gave 50,000 men to Feng to command. Unfortunately, they lost more than half in the battle across the river. The remaining small number of more than ten regiments on the Jinpu Railway attempted to cross the river and occupy Jinan, but the plan also failed. The remaining troops in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway and in the rear could not be mobilized. Therefore, he is in a military dead end. And the political responsibility he bears is not only that the government cannot be organized and established, but also that the foreign affairs and financial plans have failed. Even the recent seizure of the Tianjin Customs shows his boredom. As for party affairs, there is no history to speak of. Now that military and political affairs are in a dead end, and the propaganda of the Fengtian troops being sent is in full swing, we can conclude that Yan's return to Taiyuan will be a consideration of his own position and a discussion of his aftermath plans. (Ask): What is Mayor Zhang's observation on the future of the war situation? (Reply): Yan's current situation is already like this, and Zhang Gui in Hunan is also surrounded and easily annihilated. The Central Army completely dominates the battlefields of Longhai and Pinghan. The future of the war does not need to be known by those with military knowledge. (Ask): Since the future is so optimistic, why was there news of the retreat of the Pinghan Central Army a few days ago? (Reply): This is not something that outsiders can know. The movement of the Pinghan Central Army is called repairing the front line in military terms. It is a tactic that must be adopted to change positional warfare into mobile warfare. The rebel army does not know this and regards it as a forced retreat, which is a big mistake. This is the main reason why they are dominated by the Central Army on the battlefield. Nothing in the world can be won if you do not know yourself and know your enemy. (Ask): How many days will it take to end the war? (Reply): According to my estimation, it will take at most one month to end. At this point, Mayor Zhang's pre-arranged foreign guests arrived, and the reporters excused themselves and left.</p>
<p>Foreign Nationals in Jinan</p>
<h3 id="e118">National Government Responsible for Protection <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a notice to the consulates:</p>
<p>After the punitive expedition against the rebels began, rumors in Shanghai spread rampantly, and foreign nationals were particularly prone to believe reactionary propaganda. All those with relatives and friends residing in Jinan have requested their respective consulates to inquire with our authorities about whether the Chinese government will be responsible for protecting foreign nationals outside of the foreign concessions in the Jinan and Qingdao areas. The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had previously submitted a report to the Ministry, requesting instructions to inform the consulates to relay to foreign nationals that the civilians within the area of the Central Army are of course under its protection and should not be alarmed. Yesterday, the Office again received instructions from the Ministry, stating roughly: "Upon the order of Chairman Chiang, the Central Army is well-equipped in the Jinan area and there is no danger of it falling to the rebel army. The National Government is fully responsible for the lives and property of all foreign nationals in Jinan. This is to be communicated to the consulates for them to notify all foreign nationals." This has been communicated to the consulates of various countries in Shanghai for their information.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Gold Price Rose Again Yesterday <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Highest at 615 Taels</p>
<p>The price of gold soared again yesterday. The price of gold had been rising continuously for several days, but it was always within 610 taels. Unexpectedly, it broke the unprecedented new record yesterday. The highest price on the exchange was 615 taels, and it closed at 612.5 taels. The price of gold jewelry at Dahang was 84 yuan. The market is chaotic and people are panicking. No one knows where this will end.</p>
<p>American Silver Still Arriving in Shanghai: The mail ships from San Francisco to Shanghai still arrive once a week, carrying silver bars each time of about one million taels to Shanghai. However, because the customs prohibits landing, when the last two mail ships arrived in Shanghai, only 198 bars out of 828 on the first ship were allowed to be unloaded in Shanghai. Of the 925 bars on the second ship, only 175 were allowed to land. The rest were diverted to Hong Kong for unloading.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Bans Silver Imports: With the Shanghai ban on silver imports, large bars that should have been unloaded in Shanghai are mostly going to Hong Kong, resulting in a large increase in Hong Kong's silver reserves. Shanghai also often has large shipments of Mexican dollars going there. Yesterday, we received a telegram from Hong Kong that the Hong Kong government has also issued a ban on the import of silver and Mexican dollars. Shanghai's silver coins can no longer be shipped in large quantities.</p>

<h3 id="e121">The Japanese Rumor of <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Pacific Illegal Immigration Group</p>
<p>Scamming Money</p>
<p>Killing Lives</p>
<p>According to Japanese sources, an extremely terrifying secret illegal immigration conspiracy has occurred in the Pacific shipping industry. The discovery of this matter was still in the autumn of last year. It seems that there is an illegal immigration group on the Eastern coast (including Shanghai, Hong Kong, Japan, and other places), and the person in charge seems to be a certain national. The method is to send members to major ports to contact travelers who are not qualified to go to the United States but are determined to go. The group will take responsibility for bringing passengers on board so that they can cross the ocean to reach the United States without being hindered. The price for guaranteeing illegal immigration is divided into about three categories: the largest is 1200 yuan, the second is 700 yuan, and the smallest is 500 yuan. It is said that many people have been fooled and have smuggled overseas. Most of them pay half the amount first, and the rest is paid after arriving. However, after this case occurred, those who set off disappeared. In August and September of last autumn, the Japanese authorities conducted strict inspections of this matter and prohibited newspapers from publishing it. At that time, a fooled Japanese person risked his life to escape halfway, and the secret of the illegal immigration group was gradually known to the world. The other day, a certain ship came to Shanghai from the United States, and another Japanese person who was fooled but not harmed was found out and sent back to Shanghai. It is said that after the group tricked half of the money from the smuggled passengers, they would agree to board the ship together. When the ship sailed into the Pacific Ocean, they would use poison, lure the passengers to the deck, and have their accomplices tie them up and throw them into the ocean. This would not only silence them, but also get a huge amount of money. It is said that the number of people who have been lured to their deaths and thrown into the ocean by these people is unknown. Now that this matter has been exposed, the ship inspectors are also extra strict.</p>

<p>Daughter Cries and Refuses</p>
<p>Mother Whips Her</p>
<p>Finally Swallows Opium and Commits Suicide</p>
<p>The Yangzhou girl Yan Yue'e, who lives at No. 5 Anren Lane, Fuyou Road in the city, is a beautiful young woman of fourteen years old. She once studied at a nearby elementary school and knows a little bit of literacy. Later, she assisted her mother in managing the household affairs, so she dropped out of school and worked as a needlewoman at home. Unexpectedly, her father, who had been out of work for a long time and had a difficult life, planned to sell his beloved daughter to a brothel to make a living by selling her smiles. However, the plan was not kept secret, and the girl heard about it. She tearfully pleaded with her mother, saying that she did not want to fall into the world of prostitution and begged her mother to help her. Unexpectedly, her mother was ashamed and angry and whipped her. Under the pain, Yue'e knew that her parents' will was firm and could not be reversed. It would be better to leave this world early and avoid a life of selling her flesh. So she decided to commit suicide. Yesterday afternoon, she secretly swallowed opium paste behind people's backs. After being discovered by her family, she was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, the medicine was ineffective, and she died at around 6 PM.</p>

<p>Collecting Deeds of Martyred Martyrs</p>
<p>For the sake of commemorating the martyrs who sacrificed their lives, the Shanghai Special Municipality South Shanghai and Zhabei Defense Corps has appointed a preparatory committee to decide to build a martyrs' memorial pagoda and build a martyrs' public cemetery. The preparatory committee for the construction of the martyrs' memorial pagoda and the martyrs' public cemetery has sent an official letter to the captains of each team, requesting them to send a copy of the names and deeds of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in each team to the meeting so that they can be collected and submitted. The original letter is copied below: "Respectfully, this preparatory office is building a memorial pagoda and a public cemetery for the members of the Defense Corps who have sacrificed their lives in the past in order to commemorate them forever. However, it is necessary to collect the deeds before starting work. Since so-and-so member of your team is one of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives, please send a detailed copy of the deeds for reference, and please send all photos and copper plates together.</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Murderer Jiang Jigui Sentenced to Death <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Committed Two Murder Cases</p>
<p>The bandit Jiang Jigui (also known as Zhang Jigui) shot and killed Cao Buhua, the owner of a teahouse on Jungong Road, in August of the 16th year of the Republic of China. On January 30th of the 18th year of the Republic of China, Wu Tingyao, a patrol officer of the fourth precinct of the fifth district, was searching pedestrians on the road, and Jiang opened fire and killed the patrol officer. An accomplice, Liu Zilin, was captured by the police and handed over by the local court. Because he was an accomplice, he was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment. Now the principal offender Jiang Jigui has also been arrested. After investigation by Yang Wenxun, the prosecutor of the local court, he filed a public prosecution on the grounds that the criminal had committed multiple major murder cases. Judge Wu Zhen opened the court for trial. After the debate was over, the judge and prosecutor opened the court yesterday to pronounce the verdict. Jiang Jigui persisted in evil and could not be forgiven by the law and was abandoned by society. Therefore, Jiang was sentenced to death and deprived of public rights for life. After the sentence was pronounced, he was ordered to be returned to prison to await reporting to the superior for review and execution.</p>

<p>Opening Set for July 1st</p>
<p>Wang Hanli, Zhu Ziyun, Zhu Jiansheng, and others believe that the summer season has arrived, and many plagues are breaking out. Jiangwan is densely populated, and most of the poor live there. If there is no temporary hospital to provide relief, if a plague breaks out, it will spread rapidly, and the faithful will be in danger. So they each donated large sums of money to establish the Jiangwan Plague Hospital and build a new house. The opening is scheduled for July 1st. Yesterday afternoon, the colleagues of the hospital held an inauguration meeting at the Gongdelin Vegetable Society. More than 20 people attended, including Lu Qi, Tao Jianhua, Xu Kesheng, Shen Zihou, and Dai Hongen. Cai Xiangxun was elected as the chairman. After reporting on the progress of the preparations, it was decided to provide treatment and medicine for three months.</p>

<p>The Tianjin Road Plague Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society is the first institution in Shanghai to treat plague. Many poor and sick people benefit greatly every summer. Over the years, its achievements have been the best in Shanghai. According to the report of the Public Concession Health Department last year, the Red Cross has the highest cure rate for plague. This year, it was originally planned to open earlier, but due to the relief of the famine in the northern provinces and the rescue of soldiers and civilians in the war zone, the funds are quite difficult. Recently, Wang Zhenchuan, a member of the society and a doctor, has asked Chang Yunheng and Shen Lansong, the owners of the Shanghai stage, to hold a charity performance for one day. It is said that Chang Shen and the entire cast have agreed to enthusiastically support it. It is also said that Du Yuesheng, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Xiaolai, and Wang Peiyuan, the chairman of the society, and Dr. Wang Zhenchuan have joined the performance.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the seventh day of the People's Art Exhibition held in the Yimiao Inner Garden after the opening. Although it was raining all day, the number of visitors was not reduced. The oil paintings of Pang Tongqin, the pastel paintings of Pan Liangyu, and the watercolor paintings of Zhang Meisun in the Western Painting Department can all attract the attention of visitors. Pang and Pan are both female writers, which is especially commendable. Various picture newspaper companies have contacted the association to take film footage after the closing, and to borrow some of the works with the consent of the exhibitors for making plates for the benefit of fellow enthusiasts. Today (the 22nd) is Sunday, and the visitors will inevitably be crowded. In addition to tidying up the exhibits of each department, the staff of the association will be on duty at the venue, and the Zhongling printing machine produced by Hanli Company will print and distribute calligraphy and paintings of celebrities on the spot.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Lawsuit Regarding Inheritance between Mother and Son <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Mother Says Son Slanders</p>
<p>Son Says Mother Occupies</p>
<p>Yu Longzhang of Ningbo, residing at No. 17 Dong Street, Xiaodongmen, has recently stated that after the death of his father, Yu Jinlin, all the inherited property was seized and occupied by his father's concubine, Yu Cai, and his requests were ignored. Therefore, he entrusted lawyer Chen Wenzhao to publish a statement in the newspaper, roughly stating that any transfer or disposal of the property would not be valid unless Longzhang personally signed it. Yu Cai also hired a lawyer to publish a rebuttal in the newspaper, stating that Yu Cai was Yu Jinlin's successor wife, and should not be deliberately slandered and her reputation damaged. She then filed a self-accusation with the Criminal Court of the District Court, stating that Yu Longzhang had committed two counts of slander. Yu Longzhang, still represented by lawyer Chen, filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the District Court, stating that the defendant Yu Cai was occupying the inheritance and concealing the receipts, requesting a judgment to return the property for management. He also stated that during his late father Jinlin's lifetime, he formally married Jin, who bore three children. The plaintiff is the only son, the elder sister is married, and the younger sister is not yet married. His late mother, Jin, died in the fourth year of the Republic of China. His late father had an affair with the defendant while he was away. Although they lived together later, she never obtained a formal status. Unfortunately, his late father passed away on May 2nd of this year. All the inheritance should naturally be legally inherited by the plaintiff. Unexpectedly, the defendant seized all the partnership shares and all the property that his late father had with others during his lifetime. She also published an obituary, claiming to be the successor wife, and referred to the distant cousin Yu Longbin as a mourning nephew. She regards the plaintiff as an enemy, while maintaining close contact with her daughter from her previous marriage. These actions clearly indicate an intention to endanger the property. Considering that his late father's lifetime of hard work resulted in various properties worth tens of thousands of dollars, the plaintiff married the year before last and has a son. Household expenses require money everywhere. Now that the defendant has seized everything, his livelihood is cut off. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit requesting a judgment to order the defendant to hand over all the property for management. Yesterday, the Criminal Court first summoned the case at 11:00 AM, presided over by Judge Deng Peiyi, who specially opened the eighth courtroom for the trial. The plaintiff and his lawyer, Dai, arrived in court, but the defendant was absent, represented by lawyer Chen Wenzhao. According to the plaintiff Yu Cai's testimony, she is 46 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 5 Yuyou Lane, Changsheng Bridge, Xiaodongmen. (Question) What is your relationship with Yu Jinlin? (Answer) He is my husband, and I am his concubine who became the legal wife, married in the fourth year of the Republic of China. (Question) When did Jinlin pass away? (Answer) May 2nd of this year. (Question) What is your relationship with Longzhang? (Answer) He is the son of his first wife. (Question) Why did you sue him? (Answer) He drove me out and ordered me to hand over the property, not acknowledging me as his mother, and saying that I was his father's mistress, damaging my reputation, so I sued him. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer presented the marriage certificate, family tree, obituary, and other documents for the court to examine. After reviewing them, the defendant's lawyer stated that the defendant had returned to Ningbo for business and had submitted a letter. He then described the defendant's age and origin, stating that Yu Longzhang, the defendant, is 20 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 17 Dong Street, Xiaodongmen. The plaintiff is accusing him of slander, but according to Article 339 of the Criminal Procedure Law, it does not apply between direct relatives, spouses, or family members living under the same roof. Therefore, the self-accusation is not legally valid. Furthermore, there is no crime of slander in fact, and the defendant has already had a son and should legally inherit the property. He requested the court to reject the self-accusation. He also submitted four copies of the newspaper articles published by both parties. The judge told the lawyers of both parties that this case is very clear and is entirely a civil dispute. Since the defendant is absent today, the hearing will be adjourned for further investigation. The court then adjourned.</p>

<p>Secretaries Ma and Wang Unable to Handle the Situation</p>
<p>Zhou Wanzhen, a woman from Changzhou residing at No. 80, Xishou Lane, South of Haichao Temple, Lujiabang, Nanshi, requested to dissolve her engagement with her fiancé, Shen Wenbin, a local. She had previously entrusted a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Special District Court. After a hearing, Shen also agreed to dissolve the engagement, but demanded the return of the 1,000 yuan engagement gift, as detailed in this newspaper (18th). It is now known that after the court hearing, when Zhou Wanzhen stepped out of the court, her mother had pre-arranged for several people to drag Wanzhen into a car and drive her home, where she was severely beaten and forced to marry, or else she would be put to death. Fearing for her life, the woman asked a friend to submit a request to the Shanghai Women's Association for assistance. Yesterday, the association dispatched secretaries Ms. Ma and Ms. Wang to Zhou's home to investigate the truth. Unexpectedly, as they knocked on the door, her mother went crazy, attacking anyone she saw and tearing the two secretaries' umbrellas to shreds. Fearing an incident, the two secretaries went to the local Public Security Bureau and, together with the police, went to inquire. Her mother continued to act wildly, and the two secretaries, seeing the dangerous situation, were unable to reason with her and returned to the association to report and discuss a solution.</p>
<p>Women's Report</p>
<h3 id="e130">Whereabouts of Robbers in Pudong <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Woman's Testimony Suspicious</p>
<p>Robbers Deny Everything</p>
<p>The home of a resident with a certain surname in Sanlintang, Pudong, was robbed by armed bandits on the 28th of last month. Although the local police and militia were notified to investigate, there has been no progress. Until the day before yesterday, a woman from Jurong named Chuan Li, residing at No. 140, Route Lafayette, French Concession, reported to the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau that she knew the whereabouts of Shi Yuting, one of the robbers from Haimen, at No. 854, Qipu Road, Public Concession. The Bureau Chief, upon receiving the report, dispatched four detectives to the Huishi Police Station to request assistance. Detective Chief added Bao Detective Peng Guangfu, who went to ambush the suspect at 5:00 AM yesterday. They found Shi and his mistress, Jin Shen, still in bed and arrested them both. They were then taken to the Special District Court. Detectives from the County Public Security Bureau brought the woman who reported the case to the court, along with an official document requesting transfer of custody. Judge Sun Yuan opened the court for a preliminary hearing. According to Fu Li's testimony, Shi Yuting also lived at No. 140, Route Lafayette, so she knew him. Since he moved to Qipu Road, the two families still visited each other frequently. On the 8th of this month, I went to Shi's home to gamble at mahjong and saw many people gathered there, with gold and silver jewelry, clothing, and bags scattered in the room. I paid close attention and later learned that they had been robbed from Pudong. At that time, they gathered to divide the spoils, so I reported it to the Public Security Bureau. My family runs a barbershop. On the 23rd of last month, an apprentice in the shop went missing, and we immediately searched for him. We happened to encounter the police searching, and I was carrying a package. The police, suspecting my behavior, took me to the Third Branch of the Third District. After I provided conclusive proof that the clothes in the package belonged to me, I was released. At the same time, Shi Yuting was also detained by the branch for carrying a package containing five leather garments. However, I do not know how he was released. Judge Sun found that the woman's testimony was full of discrepancies and difficult to understand. He ordered her to provide detailed information on how she knew Shi was one of the robbers in the case. The woman's answers were evasive and self-contradictory. Realizing that there must be another reason behind this, the court dismissed the woman and turned to Shi Yuting for questioning. Shi denied being a robber, saying that he was indeed acquainted with Chuan Li when he lived on Route Lafayette, but they separated due to some reason. I moved to Qipu Road, and I did not expect that she would hold a grudge and falsely accuse me of being a robber. Jin Shen testified that she was originally from Suzhou and came to Shanghai in March to work as a maid. She met Shi Yuting, and they fell in love and lived together. She knew nothing about the robbery. Judge Sun reviewed the testimony and ordered Shi Yuting and Jin Shen to be detained separately. Fu Li was asked to provide a shop address and a guarantor to ensure that she could be summoned at any time. The police were ordered to send detectives to the Third Branch of the Third District to inquire about whether they had intercepted the five leather garments and await further investigation.</p>

<p>Four Men and Women Arrested in Succession</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, Hongkou Police Detective Mao Yiwen received a report that robbers were planning to go to Zhaojiadu to rob. He and detective Zhang Bingcheng, officer Yang Zhaoqing, and others armed themselves and waited at Jiangjiaqiao, Route Connaught, because it was a necessary route. Soon, Jin Zhongyi and Wu Ziming from Pudong came along, and their behavior seemed suspicious. Upon questioning, Wu became nervous and fled. They first arrested Jin and then chased after Wu and brought him back to the police station. Upon searching Jin, they found two loaded pistols on him, which were confiscated. Then, based on the information provided by the two men, they went to No. 25, Route Edward VII, and arrested another accomplice, Li Chengui, from Songjiang, in Swallow Nest. They found four bullets on him. Along with Li Su, a woman from Pudong who sold cigarettes, they were taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were jointly taken to the Special District Court and interrogated by Judge Ge. According to Jin Zhongyi's testimony, yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, a friend, Secretary Wang, gave me two loaded pistols and ordered me to take them to Zhaojiadu. I refused to carry them because I knew they were prohibited items. Wang said it was not for robbery and that there was no harm in carrying them. I was fooled and carried them for him. Wu Ziming was not traveling with me, and I do not know who he is. Wu testified that he was going to Zhaojiadu to borrow money from a friend. He was passing through the area and was arrested along with them. Li Chengui testified that the bullets on me were given to me by a friend surnamed Pan. The rest of his testimony was evasive. Li Su testified that Li Chengui often came to buy cigarettes, so I know him. I have never met Jin and Wu. Judge Ge, believing that the police still needed to investigate, ordered the defendants to be detained separately for further hearing.</p>

<p>The office hours of the local procuratorate in this port are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

He now intends to follow the foreign system and change the daily office hours from July 1st to the end of August to 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, with no office hours in the afternoon. In necessary circumstances, office hours may be extended at any time.

<p>American Court Orders Chauffeur to Pay Compensation</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, Ms. Hopu, a typist at Deutsche Asiatische Bank, hired a car from the Park Motor Company with a friend on the night of March 10th after attending a banquet in Hongkou. When the car drove to the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, the chauffeur crashed into a pole in the center of the road, causing Ms. Hopu to fall in the car and injure her foot and knee. She recovered after a month of treatment. Afterwards, she filed a complaint with the American Court against the motor company, demanding 2,000 US dollars in damages and 300 taels in medical expenses. Yesterday (20th), the American judge opened the court for trial. First, the doctor testified about the injuries, and then the plaintiff recounted the cause of the accident, saying that the chauffeur, Zhu A Long, seemed to be dozing off while driving. He drove from North Sichuan Road to Nanjing Road very well, but when turning onto Nanjing Road westbound, there were no pedestrians in the street, so there seemed to be no reason for the accident. The chauffeur, Zhu A Long, claimed that he was not dozing off while driving, but saw a child two feet in front of the car and turned the car to the right, causing it to collide with the lamppost. The judge said that no one else saw the alleged child, so it was difficult to believe, and ordered the defendant to pay 750 US dollars in compensation.</p>

Because they have been abroad for a long time, they miss their homeland. Therefore, in late May, they boarded the Franken, a ship of the North German Lloyd (Norddeutscher Lloyd), and set off from Geneva to return home. They will arrive in Shanghai on the 24th. Madame Jiang's younger brother, Zhang Shutong, came to Shanghai from Beijing in advance, and will take her children to the Gonghexing Wharf in Yangshupu to welcome her upon arrival.

<p>Those Who Claimed Her Were Two Young Women</p>
<p>The Details Remain Unknown</p>
<p>The strange woman who checked into Room 218 of Shenzhou Hotel on the evening of the 15th of this month attempted suicide by jumping into the Huangpu River near the Jinliyuan Wharf in the Sixteenth Section the next day (16th). She was rescued by Chinese police officers from a Water Patrol Police Station. She cried and laughed from time to time, but refused to reveal why she tried to kill herself or her real name, only saying that her father was a prominent figure in society. This was reported in the 17th edition of this newspaper. Afterwards, the police station ordered a detective to transfer her to the District Court. She initially claimed to be Zhu Yiwu, 21 years old, from Nanjing, but her accent did not sound like Nanjing dialect, so the judge became suspicious and interrogated her severely. Unexpectedly, she not only refused to reveal the truth but also denied that the name Zhu Yiwu was her real name. The judge had no choice but to order her to be temporarily detained in a nursing home, waiting for relatives to claim her. It has now been reported that recently two young women came to the home requesting that the woman be allowed to be taken away. After the prosecutor secretly questioned them, he allowed the two women to take the woman away. However, because the case was kept strictly confidential and closed to the public, outsiders could not find out the truth.</p>

<p>Japanese Collecting Taxes at Tianjin Customs on Behalf</p>
<p>After the northern forces forcibly seized the Tianjin Customs, the National Government has made a serious statement and ordered the blockade of the Tianjin Customs. All countries are paying close attention due to the relationship between customs duties and foreign debt guarantee funds. The Japanese Embassy received a telegram from Secretary Yano in Beiping yesterday, reporting the detailed situation. Acting Minister Shigemitsu telegraphed the Japanese government for instructions, but there is currently no concrete expression. However, according to a telegram from the Japanese Consul in Tianjin, Japanese merchant ships continue to import goods every day. Currently, because the customs officers of Tianjin Customs have been ordered to stop working, the Japanese Consulate has sent staff to the Customs to act as customs officers, performing duties, unloading goods from Japanese ships ashore, and collecting taxes as usual. However, the collected taxes are kept in the care of the Japanese Consul and will be returned to the legitimate Customs in the future. This special action of the Japanese has attracted the attention of various countries. The offices of the embassies of various countries in Shanghai have all considered it a major incident and have telegraphed their respective governments to report and request instructions.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Crisis of China's Tung Oil Industry in the United States <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Report from the Consulate General in New York</p>
<p>Tung oil is a unique product of China, and the amount exported annually is enormous, especially to the United States. However, the United States has recently been promoting the cultivation and advocating for it in an effort to regain its own rights and interests. The impact of this is sufficient to harm the future of China's tung oil industry. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has received a report from the Consulate General in New York regarding the current situation and future prospects of Chinese tung oil in the United States, which is worthy of reference. The Ministry has instructed the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to inform them and to pass it on to Chinese tung oil merchants. An excerpt of the original report is as follows. It is hoped that tung oil operators in our country will pay close attention to it.</p>
<p>The Situation of Tung Oil Sales to the United States: Tung oil is a unique product of China. In recent years, the amount exported abroad has been enormous. The main destination for these sales is the United States, accounting for two-thirds of the total exports each year. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, the amount of Chinese tung oil exported to the United States has been increasing by more than 10 million pounds per year, with a value increase of more than 1.5 million gold yuan per year, which is a noteworthy matter.</p>
<p>The Uses of Tung Oil in the United States: Tung oil is mainly used for making paints in the United States. The American-made oilcloth, linoleum, and other items rely entirely on tung oil as their sole raw material. American daily furniture, radios, automobiles, and steamships all require tung oil. Even fertilizers sometimes use it. Factories in the US rely on Tung Oil heavily.</p>
<p>The Success of American Trials: In view of the extensive uses of tung oil and its important position in industry, the United States has achieved remarkable results in recent years in trying to grow tung trees in Florida. The quality of the tung oil produced is superior, which is sufficient to compete with Chinese tung oil. However, the land suitable for planting tung oil in the United States is only in one area of Florida. The production can only supply a portion of the needs of the eastern United States. The needs of the central and western United States are still supplied by China. Therefore, the number of Chinese tung oil exports to the United States has continued to increase in recent years, which has attracted the attention of planters in the US. They plan to vigorously promote the planting of tung trees in the hope of increasing production to resist the import of Chinese tung oil.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm of Merchants for Promotion: An American named Berlin has organized a company in Miami, Florida, specializing in selling tung seeds to residents of the state. The company also has film lectures to guide the planting of tung trees and the ways to make profits. Advertisements are published in the local newspapers to make strange publicity to arouse the attention of Americans. Berlin Company recently published a full-page advertisement in the local newspaper, the Sun, titled "Do you want to make China's dream come true?" The content describes how China has monopolized the production and supply of tung oil to the world for fifty years, manipulating American industry. The people of the United States should break China's monopoly and work hard to plant tung trees. There is a free movie every night at 7:30 PM. Please listen to a special lecture on tung oil. The intention is very profound.</p>
<p>The Future of Chinese Tung Oil in the United States: In recent years, the United States has planted tung oil in Florida, achieving remarkable results, and the oil quality is far better than that of China. With the enthusiasm of merchants for patriotic publicity, the production of American tung oil in the future will be even more alarming. At present, the United States is still unable to supply enough, and it has no choice but to seek it from China. Once tung trees are planted everywhere and a large amount of tung oil is supplied, it will be difficult for Chinese tung oil to compete with it. As a precaution, China should quickly improve tung oil, improve quality, and persuade oil merchants to engage in large-scale manufacturing to reduce costs so as to compete with American products.</p>

<p>The 57th issuance of Central Bank's reserve inspection report states, "According to the regulations in Article 15 of the Central Bank's articles, this committee is responsible for inspecting the reserves for the convertible notes issued by this bank. We have conducted the 57th inspection on the 20th of June, 1920 at the bank's issuance bureau. The results are announced as follows. The total amount of convertible notes issued is 15,971,501 silver yuan. 14,825,810 of that is in silver yuan notes and 1,145,691 is in supplementary coin notes. The total amount of the reserve for the convertible notes is 15,971,501 silver yuan. It is composed of 11,200,496.2 silver yuan in cash reserves. The cash reserves are 8,131,800.0032 yuan in the bank's issuance vault, 1,272,135.14 yuan in the branches of various cities, and 1,800,0560.07 yuan in other banks. The guaranteed reserve is 4,767,004.8 silver yuan. According to Article 2 of the Central Bank's convertible note regulations, 60% should be in cash reserve and 40% in guaranteed reserves. The cash exceeds the 60% and the guarantee falls below the 40%, therefore it is in agreement with the regulations." This report is made on the 20th of June, 1920 by the chairman of the supervisory committee of the Central Bank, Li Fuxun, supervisors Wang Jingli, Bei Songsun, Qin Runqing, Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, and Xu Jiqing.</p>

<p>A woman from Jiangbei, Huang Xia, arrested Chen Keji and turned him in to the third precinct of the first district yesterday, claiming that she lived at No. 6 Lushuxi Street, Dananmen. Chen owed her husband 55 yuan. She went to him on New Year's Eve last year to demand payment, but he refused. Then, on the sixth day of the new year, Chen came to her house with Zhang Zhaoming. However, Zhang had previously injured her husband and was sentenced to 40 days of prohibition by the local court, so there was a feud. At that time, Chen said that the money was prepared and asked to borrow a voucher from a friend to get the money outside. Unexpectedly, after her husband went out, he never returned. His whereabouts are unknown. She had been searching for him. Chen and others also disappeared suddenly. She arrested Chen in a teahouse in Xiaonanmen and asked for an investigation. If he was already dead, she asked for justice. Chen Keji firmly denied everything. The director of the police station considered the matter to be of great importance and immediately sent him to the local court for thorough investigation.</p>

<p>If you were to visit a larger factory, you would often see workers without all ten fingers, with hands like mallets, some with only one arm, others blind in one eye, and some with a limp. The working ability of these disabled people is far inferior to that of healthy individuals. Yet, they are all employed there. If you do not know the underlying reason, you might think that the factory owner has a heart of Buddha, full of compassion, and is taking in these people. Little do you know that the reason they became disabled is similar to brave soldiers on the front lines, risking their lives on the battlefield, returning with flowers. Having suffered the tragedy of severed limbs and broken necks, those in charge have no choice but to find ways to accommodate them so they can eke out a living. The soldier's relation to the warlord and the worker's to the factory owner may differ in purpose, but their sacrifice for their superiors is the same. Having worked in factories for many years, I have witnessed dozens of cases of severed fingers and broken arms. However, I have never seen anything as tragic as what I saw the other day. I am writing down a brief account of it to tell the readers.</p>
<p>There was a man named Chen Jinlong, from Hunan Province, who was already in his forties. He came from a military background and was dismissed due to old age. He brought his wife and daughter to Shanghai to make a living. Through the introduction of his fellow villagers, he got a job at a cotton mill. His daughter, who was twelve years old, also worked with him. The father and daughter worked hard and earned just over ten yuan a month. His wife was in charge of cooking and washing. The three of them lived frugally, and they did not have to worry about starvation. This went on for about two months. However, one night, during the night shift, Jinlong and his daughter had just finished their midnight meal. The leather belt on the cotton-carding machine he was operating fell off. He rashly grabbed a ladder and leaned it against the ground shaft of the power source. He reached for the belt, trying to put it back on the pulley. Unfortunately, he used too much force, and no one was holding the ladder. As a result, the ladder slipped, and his hand was crushed by the pulley up to his arm. He fell to the ground unconscious, his hand still caught on the pulley, spinning with the shaft. Blood splattered everywhere, a gruesome sight. Co-workers heard the noise and rushed to see what happened, all crying out in alarm. When the manager arrived, he quickly ordered people to send him to the Shanghai East Hospital. On the way, he suddenly regained consciousness and said to those who were taking him, "Please, quickly shoot me in the head and kill me. This pain that pierces to the bone is unbearable." Upon arriving at the hospital, the doctor examined him and said his condition was critical. He finally died in the hospital around 5 AM. His wife was still asleep at the time. I entered the factory at 6 AM. Colleagues told me everything that had happened, as I described above. I also saw his severed arm wrapped in newspaper, a bloody mess. I couldn't bear to look at it. I was disturbed for days. The police were informed and took the body to Fellen Road for examination. The judge ruled that the factory should pay 300 yuan in compensation to settle the case. The next day, I saw his wife and daughter, with their heads uncovered and wearing mourning clothes, coming to the factory to receive the compensation. Their eyes were swollen like walnuts. I heard that the deceased had an elderly mother in her seventies back in his hometown.</p>

<p>A few days ago, a guest asked me what the highest gold price would be recently. I was reading the newspaper at the time and saw a section about free 606 injections. I casually answered, "606 taels." Unexpectedly, the next morning after the market opened, the highest price reached 606 taels. The price then quickly declined. The guest sold 14 gold bars around that time and treated me to a lavish meal at noon. After the feast, he called me a genius. When I told him how I arrived at the number, he smiled in embarrassment. This is a true example of seizing the moment! Ji Yun, also known as Ji Xiaolan, said, "When the opportunity arises, even ghosts and gods will seize it." Observing this event, I believe this more than ever. (Thank you)</p>
<p>Alas! Disaster can strike unexpectedly. It is truly a tragic occurrence. It shows that those who are not well-versed in mechanics and familiar with the structure of machines should not rashly handle them. Otherwise, accidents leading to disability or death are unavoidable. I have often advised workers of this principle, but ignorant people still create such tragedies from time to time. There is truly nothing that can be done.</p>
<h3 id="e172">The Emergence of Ms. Guan Zilan's Exhibition: Shiguang <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Recently in Shanghai's art world, it seems there have been few Western painting exhibitions. Individual exhibitions are even rarer. The artistic atmosphere has been almost completely lifeless. Suddenly, on the eighth floor of the Hua'an Building, a noteworthy solo exhibition opened. It was Ms. Guan Zilan's contribution to society. Ms. Guan has a special sense for her subject matter. Where others find something ordinary and unnoticeable, she boldly paints it, surprising people by transforming these mundane scenes into beautiful places. Each of Ms. Guan's paintings is filled with emotion. Some are melancholic, like "Scenery of Xiling Bridge," "Lake Shadow," and "By the Pond." Others reveal a rich emotional outpouring, like a child quietly reminiscing about a loving sister. "Back Garden" and "Bamboo Fence Outside the Pavilion" feel even more profound. She transmits her emotions from her heart, through her wrist, and onto the canvas, allowing viewers to immediately perceive a sense of lightness and vibrant vitality.</p>
<p>Hanging in the second room is a large painting titled "Listening to Music." I find it to be her most emotionally expressive and fulfilling work. A young girl, with wide, clear eyes, seems completely absorbed in appreciating the sound of the music. Even a dog raises its neck, expressing its master's subtle feelings. A child in red clothing is also soothed by the lullaby-like music, bringing comfort to their innocent young life. Everything in the painting is entranced. The viewer seems to hear the beautiful music emanating from the strings and fingers, and is thus also entranced.</p>
<p>However, there is one point with which I am slightly dissatisfied: Ms. Guan does not distinctly differentiate light. Clothes, vases, and tree trunks all appear flat. However, this does not detract from the expression of her great descriptive power, nor does it mean that her paintings are flawed because of the lack of chiaroscuro. Perhaps this is her own special artistic choice.</p>
<p>In short, from these sixty or seventy works, we can clearly understand the greatness of Ms. Guan's artistic talent and be amazed at how she reveals her hidden emotions, breaking through the recent artistic silence in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Shen Tongqian in "The Merchant of Venice" <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The play "The Merchant of Venice" is now being performed at the Danggui First Stage. One of the actors, Shen Tong, plays the greedy and hateful Shylock.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen is an old classmate of mine from Nanyang University. I recall that three or four years ago, when I was studying at Nanyang University, the student union had a drama group. They would put on a performance once or twice a semester. The talented individuals at that time included Tao Tianxing, Jia Cunjian, Xu Chuyun, and Yang Jiuquan.</p>
<h3 id="e174">A Letter Concerning Criticism of Mei Lanfang (Part 2) <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>As for the notion of a doctorate sweeping the floor, I believe Mr. Mei should not be blamed. My own footsteps have never left the country, and I am unaware of the depths of Western academia. However, I do know that those who diligently graduate, write theses, and obtain degrees are not necessarily beneficial to the nation. As for honorary degrees, the giver is merely expressing their admiration, and the recipient does not necessarily deserve the honor. If we were to measure their true learning, then those conferred upon by Xu Jurong and the various figures at Shanghai St. John's University, how would their scholarship compare? They would likely smile wryly to themselves. Why blame Mr. Mei alone? Moreover, Mr. Mei did not gain his reputation because of this. The public's aversion is something I, confined to the marketplace, have not yet heard of. Any dissenting opinions are mere speculation, lacking any verifiable evidence. The conclusion regarding the feelings of the adulators and the adulated is fascinating. However, those who offer praise, as I have presented, are engaged in open debate, and whether they are blindly praising is up to your esteemed judgment. I dare not presume. As for the person being praised, they are not originally seeking such accolades. They did not beg for it, so why should they feel ashamed? To promote virtue through art, without boasting or arrogance, I still believe Mr. Mei possesses such cultivation. This is what I dare to convey to you. Regarding your work, I have expressed my humble thoughts to the fullest extent. There are more things I wish to say: First, the Chinese tend to look down on successful people to make themselves feel superior. Second, they overvalue university degrees, especially those from the West. Third, the ingrained habit of belittling actors should be eradicated. Mr. Mei went to the United States to study and improve his craft, and fortunately, he succeeded. This is the result of his 20 years of dedicated study. The admiration of the Americans is also a result of their sincere appreciation and his utmost effort. It is not a mere formality. Therefore, why treat him as someone who is simply lucky? Moreover, music and drama share the same origins. When Chinese people go to America to study music, they often return with degrees, and I have not heard any controversy at that time. Therefore, the 20 years of stage experience of a dramatist can be compared to the five or six years of coursework of a scholar. The title of doctor may not be something to boast about, but to grant it to one and deny it to the other is excessive partiality. The ingrained habit that actors are not a respectable profession is a relic of the autocratic era, which you would not endorse. Today, so-called dramatic literature and popular education cannot do without this art form. If you insist on criticizing an actor for receiving a doctorate, it is akin to backward thinking. If we consider Shakespeare in England as an example, his writings and scholarship were concentrated upon by the English people. He was honored and praised because of his works and scholarship. Mr. Mei's stage experience and scripts are not necessarily inferior to Shakespeare's. Why are you critical of one and lenient towards the other? Furthermore, in the past, the famous Italian actor Caruso was performing in America when he fell seriously ill. The Italian king sent him a telegram of comfort, urging him to take care of himself for the sake of Italy. At that time, Italian immigrants and Americans were often at odds. However, the Americans were moved by Caruso's plays and gradually lessened their prejudice. Italy intended to expand its influence through subtle cultural influence and thus valued him highly. Today, when Mr. Mei goes abroad, he often states in his speeches that Americans can gain a better understanding of China and increase their goodwill. I am not suggesting that international formalities should add weight to Mr. Mei's significance. However, given the current state of China, as reported by Reuters, how would you, if you were an American, view such a nation? To have a Mei Lanfang who allows people to know that the ancient country of the East still has the path of music and art to offer is a remarkable achievement. I would like to offer you a toast for this. (The rest is omitted)</p>
<p>Xu Deyu, Shen Xueqian, and Yang Xiaozeng, among others. Mr. Shen is the most outstanding. Every time there was a play, Mr. Shen was always asked to play the villainous role. This is because his performance was profound, his pronunciation was clear, and he had a naturally villainous face. Once he put on makeup, he looked remarkably lifelike. In reality, Mr. Shen is of a gentle nature and has no villainous thoughts at all. However, he has such a villainous face. To judge a person by their appearance, Mr. Shen would be an exception.</p>
<p>The Shakespeare Drama Society performed the famous play "The Merchant of Venice." Some actors were perfectly suited to their roles, while others seemed a bit clumsy. I will not discuss them all. However, Mr. Shen's portrayal of the Jewish character Shylock, in his greed and wretchedness, was flawless. The grandeur of four or five years ago is still present today. If this play were performed in an old-style theater, Mr. Shen would undoubtedly be pelted with banana peels and sugarcane dregs.</p>
<p>After the play, because Mr. Shen's performance was even better than before, Yunxiu and I went backstage to visit him to express our admiration. Mr. Shen was modest and not complacent, saying that he would continue to work hard. I believe that Mr. Shen is a rare talent in the art world, so I retired and wrote this down.</p>

<p>Chapter 12: Farewell Banquet, Plucking Flowers to Preserve a Beautiful Image, Elegant Gathering in a Famous Garden, Tea Tasting to Appreciate Beauty</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen thought secretly, "It's not just that the hair should be soft and docile, but the temperament should also be like the hair, soft and docile." Although Ruiyun came from a poor background and experienced hardships, her temper was sometimes not very soft and docile. She was fine with polite people, but once people got close to her, they would inevitably get pricked. It was no big deal to her. Zuo Shichen, holding a pen, urged her, "What dishes do you want to eat? Tell me." Ruiyun said, "You decide for me. Something refreshing. No beef." Zuo Shichen wrote down "Chicken Velvet Pigeon Egg Soup." Then he said, "I remember, you like to eat cold abalone." Ruiyun didn't deny it. He then ordered three more dishes, making a total of five. A Jin said that she only needed three dishes for herself. Zuo Shichen said, "These large dishes are easy to fill up but also easy to get hungry again. Eat your fill first." Zuo Shichen thought, "This meal would be meaningless on ordinary days. They have eaten together several times just for fun. But this time, it can be considered a farewell meal. There won't be another opportunity to treat her to a second meal." Thinking this way, it seemed to have a small meaning. Would her future lead her to heaven or hell? Would she step onto the path of happiness or stumble into the palace of sorrow? This banquet, on the one hand, was like sending off a close friend who had been appointed to a high-ranking official position and was about to take office. On the other hand, it was like a relative being falsely accused and sent to prison, a farewell at the crossroads. But these were all just the fanciful thoughts of a bookworm. The person herself felt nothing. Then, she asked, "Are we not going to perform on stage today? That would be more comfortable." Ruiyun said, "Not only today, but I'm not planning to perform from tomorrow onwards." Before Zuo Shichen could ask the reason, A Jin added, "They came to tell us not to perform." Zuo Shichen asked, "Who is 'they'?" A Jin said, "It's that young master Zhang over there. Their meaning is that it's almost the holiday, so not performing on stage won't be a big loss. The Big Aunt thinks it's best to perform on stage until the day she gets married. Naturally, she just wants to make more money for each performance. But can people agree to her? The news of A Nan getting married has already spread among the guests. She's still performing on stage, and countless rumors are flying around. There are countless people gossiping. We naturally say that there's no such thing, but 'a tightly sealed bottle mouth can't stop the flow of gossip.' How can we hide it from people? Yesterday, the matchmaker of the young master Zhang, Mr. Sun from the pawnshop, came to discuss with the Big Aunt at the business, telling A Nan not to perform on stage anymore. Anyway, it's only two or three days until the holiday." Zuo Shichen said, "That's right. It's already been decided, so why bother with all the work? It's better to rest for a few days. I don't know when they'll come to pick her up after the holiday."</p>

<p>Unprecedented Price of 615 Taels</p>
<p>Another Surge of 8 Taels and 1 Mace to Crush Speculators</p>
<p>Unending Record Peaks Yesterday, the gold price surge was unusually vigorous, hitting a historical high of over 610 taels, causing great fear. The process was smooth, gradually rising with unstoppable momentum. Exchange rates remained unchanged, and domestic rates rose slightly without special progress. Market trading was vigorous, with buyers dominating, leaving speculators speechless. Companies like Yuan Mao Yong, Cheng Feng Yong, and Zhi Feng Yong were among those following. Fu Chang, Yong Feng, and Yuan Cheng Yong had sold, but the transaction volume was not large. The market opened high in the morning and initially fell due to large orders, then softened slightly due to some sales. Later, exchange rates improved and looked upward, jumping to 607 or 608 taels. There was a brief period of consolidation, fluctuating by 3 or 4 taels, but at noon, everything changed. The surge was indescribable, skyrocketing by 10 taels to reach a peak of 615 taels. The possibility of a further decline in silver prices and expensive exchange rates led to large-scale purchases. The recent sales price of Japanese gold by the Japanese bank reached 1 tael 3 mace 7 fen 5 li, and British gold settled at only 5 pence 8125. In the end, the gold price settled at 612 or 613 taels.</p>
<p>The Market Opens With 2 Taels Rise; British Silver Telegraph Declines One-Eighth in Spot, and One-Sixteenth in Forward; Silver Price Decreases Three-Eighths. Gold price for August opened at 606 taels 5 mace, with an increase of 2 taels 1 mace. Spot market had fluctuations of 2 taels. Sellers were active with a soft undercurrent. Japanese gold prices were loose, with Mitsui offering 1 tael 3 mace 5. British gold also advanced to 6 pence 1875. Thus, when the official gold price was announced, it was only 602 taels 2 mace. Also, exchange rates remained unchanged. Soon, smaller dealers took profits and settled their short positions, while Fu Yu and arbitrageurs were also buying. Forward British gold for next month could be done at 6 pence 0625. Hua Bank then sold forward British gold at 6 pence, causing a jump of 5-6 taels, reaching 608 taels 6-7 mace after 10 o'clock.</p>
<p>Momentum Increases Significantly At Noon; News of Exchange Rate Retreat Caused Concern; Spot US Dollar Settled at 36.5 Yuan; British Gold at 5 Pence 9375. With limited buyers on the floor, and with some sellers, price declined over 4 taels, reaching 604 taels after 11 o'clock. Outsiders were coming in to buy, pushing prices up. British Gold was absorbed by banks at 6 pence 0625, buyer interest increased without any selling. The market atmosphere was sharp, breaking through the 610 tael mark. When closing the market it reached 15 taels with most short positions under heavy pressure. Price dropped back 2 taels, then closed at 612 taels 5 mace, with an increase of 8 taels 1 mace compared with the previous day.</p>

<p>Various Brokers Did Not See Substantial Inflows/Outflows. Trading Among Brokers Remained Active. Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Fuchang, Hengxing, Shunli and Wanxing saw some activity. Yuanmaoyong, Chengfengyong, Yifengyong, Fuyu, Shunmao, Yuancheng and speculators bought. Tianyuyong, Yongchengchang, Yuancheng, Yuankangxiang, Taixing and Yongfeng sold.

<p>Yesterday, being Saturday, the foreign exchange market was only open for half a day as usual. The exchange rates posted by HSBC remained unchanged. However, the silver market showed a slight decline. The domestic rates for the three currencies (British, American, and Japanese) were all tense, but not as sharply as the surge in gold prices. The current prices were not far from the posted rates, and arbitrage opportunities became closer. However, the rampant surge in gold prices broke through the 610-tael mark, breaking records repeatedly, even reaching 615 taels. There were fears that prices would continue to rise, with an irresistible momentum. Chinese speculators sold 100,000 pounds sterling to Mitsui Zhengjin Shanghai, and then sold several tens of thousands of pounds more. The rest was bought in by Mitsui. Banks also traded 40,000-50,000 pounds among themselves. Around 100,000 US dollars were traded, with American Bank initially buying and then selling. Various brokers bought several hundred thousand dollars worth of Japanese gold, which was sold by Mitsubishi Mitsui. At the noon closing, the exchange rate for British money decreased by 0.25 compared to the 20th, and US money decreased by half a dollar. Japanese money increased by 1.875. There will be large-scale military equipment settlements in the near future, giving people more peace of mind, making the market more auspicious.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Powerful Rise in Foreign Exchange Rate <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Continued Rise of 1.75 Cents… Listed Price Once Reached Six Cents</p>
<p>Market Overview: This unexpected surge in the foreign exchange rate has taken everyone by surprise. The continuous upward movement has never retreated. Not only are outsiders astonished, but even those in the industry did not initially anticipate such a sudden surge. It is said that the possibility of foreign exchange rates soaring during this period of abundant banknotes this year was indeed unlikely. However, unforeseen circumstances occurred because banknotes were not issued in large quantities, nor were they shipped to other areas, leading to the widespread use of silver dollars and resulting in this adverse outcome.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate (Foreign Exchange): The market opened with bullish sentiment, and the exchange rate remained strong, closing at 7.22625 cents, up half a cent from the previous morning. Unexpectedly, buying interest surged in the afternoon, and head-end funds became even scarcer. Consequently, the opening price was immediately listed at six cents, but there were no sellers. After a prolonged period of adjustment, the market eventually closed at 7.24 cents, which was 1.375 cents higher than the morning session, resulting in a total increase of about two cents between the two sessions. (Silver Exchange): Dull and unremarkable. The morning session was at 1.2 cents, and the afternoon session was only at 0.6 cents. Head-end withdrawals continued to be high, resulting in a flat market throughout. Bank listings opened at a market rate of five cents.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: The trend of Jiangnan small silver dollars is set. The morning session was at 6.38 cents, and the afternoon session was at 6.37 cents. Fluctuations compared to the previous day were similar. Transactions amounted to 2,000 units in the morning and 1,500 units in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver dollars opened at 5.98 cents, slightly better than the previous afternoon by 0.25 cents. The afternoon session rose with the increase in the exchange rate to 5.9925 cents, up 1.125 cents from the morning. Transactions amounted to 115,000 units in the morning and 15,000 units in the afternoon. Copper coins retracted by 3,000 units, with a wholesale volume of 400,000.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver): Yesterday was Saturday, and banks closed in the afternoon as usual, resulting in lighter receipts and disbursements. Chinese merchants received and disbursed over 1.8 million, while foreign merchants received and disbursed over 1.5 million, with special disbursements of 1.89 million. Total receipts and disbursements for various goods, foreign exchange taxes, and mortgages amounted to 7.67 million, with 1.3 million withdrawn from warehouses. Japanese banks received and disbursed 2.89 million, with 300,000 deposited in warehouses. Money shops and silver firms received and disbursed over 32 million, with over 3.3 million in head-end receipts and disbursements. Foreign exchange remittances amounted to over 800,000, with about 1 million received in cash. (Foreign Exchange): Foreign exchange drafts amounted to 1.405 million in the morning and 850,000 in the afternoon. There were no banknote transactions in either session. Over-the-counter transactions amounted to 112,000 in the morning and 70,000 in the afternoon. Spot foreign exchange transactions amounted to 320,000 in the morning and 265,000 in the afternoon. Interbank trading amounted to 550,000 in the morning and 600,000 in the afternoon. Foreign exchange receipts and disbursements by various bank accounts were particularly high, totaling over 3 million. Banknote inflows and outflows were only around 1 million. Money shops and foreign exchange firms received and disbursed 6 to 7 million. Head-end foreign exchange receipts and disbursements also increased due to the rising exchange rate, totaling over 5.2 million. Foreign exchange borrowing and lending reached over 2 million. Small money shops traded 400,000 to 500,000.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Miscellaneous Tales of Foreign Exchange Shortage and Rising Rates <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>According to financial circles, rumors of rising exchange rates had already surfaced at the beginning of this week. Therefore, influential financial circles sent letters to the Hangzhou Mint requesting them to start smelting and minting coins. At that time, there was even concern about excessive silver, so large bars of raw silver were shipped to expedite the minting of silver coins. However, recent exports of raw silver from Shanghai have been substantial, resulting in a sudden depletion of reserves. The mint is also experiencing a shortage of raw materials and may have to cease minting. On the other hand, the use of miscellaneous grains is increasing daily. In addition to the shipments made in previous days, another 1.2 million was shipped to the north, 600,000 to Shantou and Xiamen, over 800,000 to the interior, and 1 million to Hankou, totaling over 3.7 to 3.8 million. Furthermore, banks, fearing that the current reserves would be depleted by these large-scale withdrawals, are also trying to collect cash and store it in their vaults as a reserve for banknotes to prevent shortages. This has led to a sudden decrease in the circulating cash supply in the market, creating concerns about insufficient funds for distribution. Moreover, most firms in the industry, believing that silver funds are abundant, have large head-end funds and hold foreign exchange accounts, unwilling to readily sell them off. As a result, a shortage of foreign exchange has been created, and there are fears that there may be significant upward surges in the future.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the spot market for bonds was very quiet. Except for a transaction of 6,500 yuan for the entire Sixth Disbandment Bond, there were no other transactions. The futures market was very active, with about 7.7 million yuan in the morning and over 4.8 million yuan in the afternoon. The situation is showing slight improvements, and the market is optimistic. Buyers are enthusiastic. The opening prices in the morning rose significantly, and the trend in each subsequent session was peaceful. As a result, the Disbandment Bond rose by about 1.5 yuan, the Customs and Troop Reduction Bonds also rose by one yuan and several cents, and the entire Sixth Rehabilitation Bond continued to rise by 0.8 to 0.9 cents. However, the 96 Bond showed a slight decline.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Cotton Yarn Market in a Brewing State <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat and uninteresting, with both sides in a stalemate. Actual sales are sluggish, and the brokers are lifeless due to the impact of the war. Sales are quiet, and the amount of inventory is increasing. Some are already expecting prices to fall, but many are holding tight due to the sharp reduction in exchange rates and the high cost of goods. The price of third-grade yarn is fluctuating sharply, making it increasingly difficult to predict the future of the yarn market.</p>
<p>The market for marked yarn is dull. The market opened with steady foreign cotton prices, but due to the high gold price, retail investors were short, pushing prices up by three to four cents. Litchang bought over 1,000 bales, with other scattered transactions. In the afternoon, there were reports of a sharp drop in third-grade yarn prices, which had reached 111 yuan this month. Sentiment softened slightly, but Maoji bought 1,600 bales, and Dafeng bought 550 bales. Prices for each month fell by 0.1 to 0.2 cents, while this month rose sharply by 0.4 cents. Total transactions for the day were 9,850 bales. The closing prices for marked yarn are recorded below:</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Closing Prices　Change　Inventory　September 15.84…　25,900</p>
<p>June 15.55　Up 0.03　17,050　October 15.89 Up 0.01　25,150</p>

<p>August 15.73…　28,350</p>
<p>Spot Demand is Quiet: Sales of spot yarn are still quiet. Statistics show that all brokers bought a total of 970 bales of forward and spot goods, with fellow traders buying 175 bales. Market conditions are flat. Among the brokers, Sichuan bought 700 bales, the interior 100 bales, Shantou 65 bales, Hankou 25 bales, Xiamen 35 bales, Ningbo 30 bales, and miscellaneous brokers 25 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Cotton Market Appears Stable <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is stable and trending firmer, mainly because the situation of American cotton has stabilized, strengthening sentiment. Selling pressure has eased slightly, and Japanese merchants have not taken any action. Furthermore, the gold price has risen, making buyers more stable, so the market is strong. However, spot cotton transactions are still quiet. The future of the cotton market still has great changes, with more fluctuations than the yarn market.</p>
<p>Hankou Marked Cotton Buying Interest Prevails: Hankou marked cotton opened in the morning, firm following foreign cotton. There was a lack of sellers in the market, and prices for each month rose by 0.1 to 0.15 cents. In the afternoon, the gold market saw higher prices again, and buying interest in the market was stronger. However, large accounts traded very little. Prices rose by 0.05 to 0.1 cents for each month. Total transactions for the day were 30,300 dan. The closing prices for Hankou marked cotton are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hankou Marked Cotton Closing Prices Change Inventory August 37.40 Up 0.20 79,900</p>
<p>June 36.15 Up 0.10 41,100 October 36.85 0.25 72,100</p>
<p>July 36.85 0.15 65,300 November 36.75 0.25 65,500</p>
<p>Cotton Sales are Sluggish and Stagnant: Spot cotton business is still quiet. The source includes 1,100 bales of Yao cotton and 50 bales of Tong cotton. Sales records are listed below:</p>

<p>American Cotton Short Covering Shows Slight Firmness: Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to purchases by fellow traders, then weakened due to good weather, and finally firmed again due to short covering. Futures prices rose by 10 to 16 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. British cotton futures rose by 6 to 8 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 15 points. Indian cotton market closed. The original telegram is recorded below: (Telegraph from the 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e186">Weekly Report on American Cotton Amidst the Sharp Decline <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Stimulated by Falling Grain and Securities Prices</p>
<p>Cotton Goods Transactions Quiet, New Cotton Good</p>
<p>New York telegram from the 20th reports the cotton market conditions for the past week: The selling pressure on raw cotton this week was stimulated by the weakness of grain and securities market prices. Reports of smooth progress in new cotton production and poor cotton goods trade caused raw cotton prices to fall to new lows for this cotton season. The market price of 12.5 to 13 cents for new cotton futures has attracted more attention, which is evident from inquiries about futures from domestic and foreign cotton mills. These inquiries, coupled with the view that cotton prices have now reached investment levels, have resulted in more attention from brokerage firms. However, most of it is short covering, as it is reported that nighttime temperatures in the cotton belt are quite low, and recent news about cotton production is not very good. However, according to general opinion, cotton production is still satisfactory, but warm and sunny weather is needed now.</p>
<p>Another report says that the cotton market continues to unwind, the reason being good weather, and the securities market and other commodities are also falling in price. At present, the drop may be excessive. However, cotton goods transactions are quiet, spot cotton demand is weak, consumption is not large, and the prospects for new cotton are quite marketable. Attached are the weekend statistics as follows (in thousands of bales):</p>

<h3 id="e187">The Black Market for Japonica Rice is Soaring Uncontrollably <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Less Than Twenty Vessels in the River</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai North market felt unprecedented scarcity. Not only were there no goods arriving from the river, but most of the rice boats that had been moored the previous day were turned back. It is said that this was because the price limit was too strict, so they returned to the interior. Another explanation is that they are still at Caojiadu in western Shanghai. As a result, the inventory in the river, including vessels that have been there for more than half a year, is less than twenty. Despite the heavy rain all day, buyers had to purchase to prevent the goods from running out. The price of northern japonica rice soared, and the black market price for top-quality japonica reached around 24 yuan. In total, the price of various grades of japonica rice jumped by more than one yuan. This kind of market is making a record for an unprecedented event. Thin-skinned rice followed suit and rose across the board. There is no accurate market price for each grade. The price for top-quality thin-skinned rice has already been quoted at 20 yuan. All day, there were only transactions, but because of the rain, shipments could not be cleared. The atmosphere in the market was extremely quiet, with no trading on the surface.</p>
<p>In Shanghai South, because of the rain, no goods arrived from the river. Each merchant mainly traded in public association foreign rice. The river rice market here was quiet, and the inventory in the docks was exhausted. Due to the rainy weather, merchants with goods in the warehouses were watching and waiting, with no sales. This situation is unprecedented.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Bean Noodle Market Rose in the Morning, Fell Back in the Afternoon <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bean noodle market was active in the morning. Due to the sudden heavy rain, the buying interest of general interior merchants rose again, and the quiet situation of each month returned. Until the market opened in the afternoon, this month carried on the remaining sentiment of the morning. At the highest time, it was again raised to 2 taels, 6 mace, and 1 cent. However, due to factory owners putting more stock on the market, long positions inevitably became wary. In addition, the exchange still strictly limits the date of payment for the certificate, so long positions did not dare to raise prices again, and the market fell back. This month fell by 0.2 cents from the opening price. The forward market fell slightly by 0.1 cents. This month was up by 0.1 cents compared to the previous month. July and August were up by 0.025 cents each. September and October were up by 0.075 cents each. November was unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Wheat Market Changes Three Times in One Day <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market showed weakness in the morning for each month. Due to factory owners intending to squeeze small long positions, they took the opportunity to sell back, so this month fell to 4 taels, 9 mace, and 6 cents at the lowest, July to 4 taels, 9 mace, and 9 cents. The remaining months had fewer ups and downs. Until the market opened in the afternoon, the bean noodle market turned bullish, and interior merchants purchased very smoothly, so the near and forward market became bullish significantly. However, later, because long positions sold back, the market turned soft again. Looking ahead, if the weather clears up and the arrival of goods becomes smooth, the market may loosen up a little. As a result, this month was down 0.02 cents compared to the previous day, July was up 0.1 cents, August was up 0.2 cents, September was up 0.3 cents, and October was up 0.4 cents, November was up 0.3 cents. Now, Fuxin is unchanged, and the market situation is slightly flat. Opening prices: Hankou wheat 4 taels, 9 mace, 2 cents to 8.7 cents, Gaoyou wheat 4 taels, 9 mace, 5 cents, Shashi wheat 5 taels, 1 mace, 5 taels, 7 cents, Jiangyan wheat 4 taels, 9 mace, 5 cents, Taizhou wheat 4 taels, 9 mace, 2 cents, Penglai wheat 4 taels, 9 mace, 6.7 cents to 9 cents, Shuangfeng wheat 5 taels, 0 mace, 2 cents to 5 taels, Pudong wheat 4 taels, 6 cents to 7 cents, Kunshan wheat 5 taels, 0 mace, 3 cents, Yuepu wheat 4 taels, 8 mace, 7 cents, a total of 7,300 bags, Xuzhou old wheat 5 taels, 4 mace, Yaowan wheat 5 taels, 4 mace, a total of 452 yuan, which was purchased by various Fufeng factories.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Sugar Market New Cargo of Dutch Brown Sugar Opened for Sale at 10,000 Bags <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Coarse and White Sugar Suddenly Rose Above the 8 Taels Mark</p>
<p>Mortgaged Dutch Sugar Sold for Over 60,000</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the sugar market, communications from production areas reported: Cuban spot sugar prices were unchanged. New York sugar futures rose by one point. Java spot sugar was at 8.875, down 0.125. July sugar futures were at 8.625, also down 0.25. August had no change. Because the Dutch exchange rate contracted again, the public association’s coarse and white sugar market was firmer. Brokers sharply raised prices, and buyers showed slight activity. The initial transaction price was 7 taels, 8 mace, 7.5 cents, which then rose to 9 cents, with high-quality sugar reaching 9.5 cents. The market situation was quite bullish, suddenly rising more than 1 cent compared to the previous day. Medium white sugar and other markets also followed suit and rose, but there were no transactions. Japanese sugar transactions were also scarce. YRO grade was at 8 taels, 1 mace, 5 cents, and YP grade was at 8 taels, 5 cents. The market called for higher prices in the afternoon, but there were few takers. Likisoon, Tsuen Lung, and other foreign firms opened for sale for July, August, and September delivery, with 10-grade Dutch brown sugar at 5 guilders in Dutch currency and 8-grade at 4 guilders and 8 jiao, totaling nearly 10,000 bags. Demand was not strong. Several banks sold over 40,000 bags of overdue mortgaged spot coarse white sugar, priced under Yuanxing, at 7 taels, 6 mace, and Huaxin goods at 7 taels, 7 mace. Another 20,000 bags of Dutch brown sugar were priced at 6 taels, 3 mace, and 6 taels, 4 mace, which were purchased by a certain six sugar firms. Compared to the market discount, they were extremely popular, with a sense of getting there first. Maochenghao opened for bidding on 8,200 bags of Grade 2 Small Lüqing, priced at 7 taels, 1 mace, and the market was also very firm and bullish.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Seafood: New Dried Shrimp Rose by More Than 3 Taels <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Due to the sudden cold weather, the output of new dried shrimp has been greatly reduced. According to reports from water brokers in Ningbo, the most that fishing boats have caught near the shore recently is only 2,000 to 3,000 catties, and as little as 1,000 to 700 catties. Therefore, fishermen are unwilling to sell cheaply, leading to a gradual increase in the market price to 33 yuan. Because the production price has risen in Shanghai, and the Shantou brokers have been actively selling recently, the previous goods have been sold out, and the cost of future purchases will be around 28 taels. Therefore, the sales price of the firms has also risen in unison, with the market price yesterday being 26 taels, which is very bullish.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Metals: Metals Affected by the Plum Rain <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The plum rain season is affecting the metal market. Although export brokers have recently added a lot of goods, they are afraid of getting wet and mildew, so they are waiting for the weather to clear before loading ships and sending cars. The purchasers are therefore stopping purchases due to this relationship. The market transaction is greatly reduced, and the trend is extremely calm. Yesterday, in addition to a few kinds of transactions such as French West nails, cement, bamboo steel, new lead wire, etc., there is nothing to record for large transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Miscellaneous News: <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>

<h3 id="e195">Central University's Bi-Monthly Publication <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Indeed, the spirit of a school and the way it studies and develops depends on what comes out of that school. Since the publication of Central University's bi-monthly publication, the entire university suddenly emitted a life-giving light. In the previously stagnant "academic institution," this point of "the great atmosphere of academic institution" has now been warmed and transformed.</p>
<p>I remember when it (referring to the bi-monthly publication) was not yet born, someone came to visit our school and said, "The dead aspects of your university have a clear overview in the Central University, but the living aspects of your university only have future scholars with silver medals inscribed with 'Striving for Perfection,' and nothing else." At that time, I felt a subtle pain in my heart when I heard these words.</p>
<p>Now, thankfully, the bi-monthly publication has been declared to have come into existence with a clap of thunder. This is certainly something we should celebrate at the beginning, but at the same time, the words of outsiders criticizing our school have gradually lost their authenticity.</p>
<p>But what is the content of Central University's bi-monthly publication like? This is what outsiders want to hear most. Although the content itself can explain it, I would like to say a few words here. Its content is divided into seven sections: dissertations, research, translation, weekly review, literature and art, miscellaneous works, and news. Its purpose is to introduce world scholarship, develop the research results of teachers and students at Central University, and spread the progress of Central University. In December of last year, the school authorities published a special literary issue, increased the number of pages, and enriched the content, resulting in deep praise from general readers.</p>
<p>The 16th issue has recently been published. (Xian Rong)</p>

<h3 id="e196">Preparing to Publish the Journal of Engineering <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The Central Institute of Technology, which is responsible for leading the nation's engineering academic affairs, has long thought of publishing a journal of engineering to publish discussions and works, and to introduce new knowledge, so as to promote construction and improve academic standards. However, due to the lack of funding for publishing, it has not been possible to proceed. Recently, seeing that the Department of Earth Sciences has published a journal of geography, its influence has not only made students specializing in the study of geography feel a deep interest in this subject, but also many students from other departments have increased their common knowledge of geography due to the introduction of the journal. Therefore, the teachers and students of the Institute of Technology feel that the previous publishing requirement is even more urgent, and have specifically requested the school to allocate funds for the publication of the Journal of Engineering. The content of the journal is divided into seven sections: illustrations, commentaries, writings, translations, investigations, industrial news, and appendices. (Xian Rong)</p>

<p>The Qingyise Restaurant at the intersection of Third Road and Zhejiang Road announces that the newly hired chef, Mr. Luo, has been studying Cantonese cuisine for more than thirty years. His cooking is excellent, and the flavor is exquisite, truly possessing the legacy of Yi Ya. Therefore, since he took office, the restaurant has been packed every day, with no empty seats in the evening. Business is once again booming. As the weather is getting warmer, more attention is being paid to food. All utensils used are washed with boiling water before use, striving for cleanliness and hygiene. Various summer cold drinks are also available, such as American ice cream in three flavors: vanilla, cream, and fruit, as well as frozen fruits such as lychees, pineapples, cherries, and loquats.

The company also sells plate-making chemicals and materials, such as Luo Dian red powder, yellow powder, black powder, anthracite, copper plates, and zinc plates.

<p>The Dajicheng Leather Goods Bureau at the corner of Henan Road and Jiujiang Road announces that since its rise in Shanghai the year before last, it has gathered fox furs of beautiful quality and exquisite craftsmanship, constantly innovating and establishing a unique style, which has long been praised by people in Shanghai as the king of the fur industry. Recently, the bureau has taken advantage of the summer slack season to establish a summer cloth and straw hat department, procuring the latest 1930s styles of men's and women's gold silk straw hats from overseas, as well as summer cloth, a famous product of Liuyang, Sichuan. The straw hats are fashionable in style and elegant in decoration, and this is the first time they have arrived in Shanghai, exclusively sold by the bureau. The summer cloth is soft and does not wrinkle easily. There is also a kind of mosquito net summer cloth, which is cool and breathable, and more durable than gauze or bamboo cloth. To give preferential treatment to customers, the bureau is partially fulfilling its obligations, selling both retail and wholesale at the same price, which is uniformly low, unlike those who specialize in this business.</p>

<p>The Haixing Film Company announces that the company was founded by prominent Shanghai merchants Li Zhongyue, Tang Weiyu, Zhu Mingqian, Dong Tianduo, and others. The first film produced is "Times and Heroes," written by the author Huang Tianduo. It is Dong's most powerful masterpiece. The plot is tragic and tortuous, passionate and慷慨, and full of the intense emotions of a stormy sea, and the courageous spirit of lightning劈雷. The story of romance between men and women, and the world of bandits and beauties, is even more moving. The company, appreciating the preciousness of this drama, has spared no effort and financial resources to produce a martial arts love epic that is melancholy and glamorous, and worthy of song and tears. Currently, costumes and props are being custom-made, and actors with artistic talent in the country are being selected to play the main roles. A huge filming location is being built in western Shanghai. As soon as everything is ready, filming will begin. It is heard that they will first go to Langshan, Tongzhou to take exterior shots. The success of this film will undoubtedly add color to the screen and is truly unprecedented good news in domestic films, it says.</p>
