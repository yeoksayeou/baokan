<h3 id="c82">日人對我國籃球隊戰術的批評 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>敵方論調願我隊員注意　　（勞）</p>
<p>臥薪嘗膽期以四年</p>
<p>此次我國出席遠東大會的籃球隊係羅致南北第一流健將合組而成向有常勝軍之稱因之　以爲大會錦標非我莫屬詎料結果出人意表竟造成四戰四北之遠東新記錄國人痛憤之餘對於失敗之由不憚苦心研究爲我隊在第十届大會中雪恥之準備許陸二君前後在本報之批評皆有獨到之之處予我國籃球界以莫大之貢獻日方對於我隊之批評甚多且苛茲擇兩君所未及者譯之藉供國人之參考</p>
<p>東京早稻田大學籃球</p>
<p>隊監督李想白的論調</p>
<p>中國隊投籃傳球帶球的技術都在日隊之下聯絡工夫最不高明而紊亂異常體魄高强是其唯一的優點換言之一天才球隊而已　　中國隊的戰法極爲笨滯仍居籃球練習程序中最簡單的階級其最得意的戰策爲縱式進攻法即由一前鋒走中路衝入敵境迎接後方之傳球而投籃千篇一律極易爲敵方所知及被敵人監視後又無他種戰略以代之宜夫一敗塗地也</p>
<p>而且日軍後衛大庭小林二氏對於此種攻法之防衛又具有天才絶技故中華隊在使用此種戰法時除唐寶堃有一二例我的成效或其他人利用身長在籃下投入或用遠投而獲黠外對於日籃幾無缘問津在日方前鋒退歸取守勢時更不必説了此中國窮於攻略而致敗也</p>
<p>關於防衛之不善不獨中國隊如此日菲亦然恃着迅快天才視注意攻而不問守是中比歷來的舊弊在五人連衛法未熟用時尙可對付現在就簡直非敗不可了各以日隊攻守兩技的實力來相較防守尙欠完備但較之中隊已高一等故中隊必敗簡言之今次大會勝敗之分全以各隊防衛力爲標準此固一般人所忽視著要知攻即是最好的防衛法想投籃而老立籃下待球是不可能的　若時時想到敵人來攻而注意防衛之始有攻敵之機會此點似夫三隊都未大注意</p>
<p>中國隊不能論全隊作戰計劃或個人進退在局外人眼中認爲不妥的實在太多茲不一一列舉惟唐寶堃君靈敏的技術與李國琛君鎭靜的打法確是不可多得之才個人技術在大會中當以兩君爲最</p>
<p>大會裁判員東城氏的</p>
<p>批評</p>
<p>中華隊進攻專用直攻法無人在兩側活動是最大的弱的每次進攻時使唐君直入敵陣毫不顧及兩邊敵方後衛奪球後退居兩旁彼此互傳以進唐君雖往返奔撲亦全無效中鋒劉建常君後衛李國琛君神速而持重不惶不忙實爲軍中異彩</p>
<p>吾人對中隊戰術上有最費解之一點當中菲第二回戰上半時唐寶堃君陳盛魁君在塲戰門力甚强以十五對三十勝蘇軍正可一鼓作氣繼續奪門詎知敎練員董守義君忽以姚恩漢君代陳成魁君華隊遂無起色即謂此次華軍之敗即此一換之代價亦非過甚之批評</p>
<p>中菲兩隊此次因日本之審判而十分狼狽自是該兩隊平日缺少嚴格審判之故但菲軍在不利情况之下尙能極力鎭定應戰獲得最後之勝利而中華則全隊竟全瓦解有如一盤散沙個人精神錯亂莫之所措此無他缺少經騐而已而唯一補救方法則多多與較强的球隊比賽</p>
<p>日本籃球界鼻祖青年會體育幹事白朗氏的話</p>
<p>中國隧在個人技術方面有良好的表演但全憑天才而少科學的訓練現在籃球成了一種科學敎練須用科學的分晣方法最要緊的初步是基本敎練包括（一）接球或捉球（二）傳球（三）投籃（四）步的動作然後逐步前進這是不容否認的中華隊有以下幾件較著的弱點</p>
<p>（一）本隊隊員投籃後本人或同隊隊員不追隨而上（Followup)故不中的球均爲敵人所得（一）中鋒拍球雖佳但拍的地位太固定因前鋒矮小拍出之球屢爲敵方搜得在此種情况之下中鋒竟不能改換拍球的方向</p>
<p>（一）從界外發球時陣綫太紊亂無一定的進攻方式故接球者常無人可傳坐失機宜</p>
<p>（一）在接球堅穩與傳球準確上須多加工夫長距離的傳球法應少用</p>
<p>（一）在敵用五人聯防法時中隊專集重中路進攻而不知向敵區兩旁之弱點施攻擊此係慣用縱線式進攻之弊此後至少應多習横線式的進攻法</p>
<p>記者按以上三氏均日本籃球界第一流威權者所作載諸日本最有價値之雜誌諸氏對於日菲兩隊亦有很詳細的批評繼日再譯出</p>

<p>Inspecting the Situation Along the Longhai Railway Line</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek Expresses Confidence in the Military Situation Nanjing: A group of foreign correspondents returned to Beijing from the front at 8:30 AM on the 6th, and then visited the Lizi Society and the Central Military Academy. After lunch at the Diplomatic Guesthouse at noon, the rest returned to Shanghai except for those stationed in Beijing. (Dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<p>Xuzhou: The group of foreign correspondents finished their visit to the front and returned to Xuzhou on the morning of the 5th, and then headed south to return to Beijing that evening. (Dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>Liu River: Departing from Guide at 9 AM, Yu Feipeng, the Director-General of the Rear Services, led the way to Liu River. In the car, Mr. Yu said that the Central Army needs 100,000 bags of rice (170 catties per bag) and 320,000 bags of flour (38 catties per bag) for food each month. The soldiers are also given soup. The soldiers' monthly income ranges from a minimum of 10.6 yuan to 18 yuan. From these figures, it can be inferred that the Central Army has about 700,000 troops. The train arrived at Liu River at 11 AM. The weather was extremely hot. An airplane made a low-altitude flight and dropped a report tube. (Military News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Liu River: At 1 PM, Chiang Kai-shek was met at the front. Because the headquarters in the train was too stuffy, the meeting was changed to under the white poplar forest near the station. After waiting for about ten minutes in the shade, Chiang Kai-shek arrived with Shao Lizi, Song Zi'an, and others. Chiang was wearing a dark Zhongshan military uniform, with a smile on his face. He greeted the reporters and invited them to sit down. He talked with the reporter group for about an hour, saying that the rebels would definitely be eliminated within a month, showing determination between his eyebrows. He also said that after sweeping away the rebellious enemy, he would follow the Prime Minister's Founding Program and work hard to complete the revolution. (Electric News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The National Government entertained a group of Shanghai and Nanjing foreign reporters who had observed the war on the Longhai Line and returned to Pukou this morning. The group met with Chiang Kai-shek at 1 PM on the 4th. Chiang was wearing a dark Zhongshan uniform and talked for about an hour. Then they proceeded to the vicinity of Li Ba Ji, west of Liu River, and heard the heavy artillery fire from the front line from a distance. After carefully inspecting the war situation in the vicinity, they returned from there. On the way back, they visited the situation in Guide City and the Central Army Airport. When Chief of Staff Yang Jie met with the reporter group this morning, he had a very frank and detailed discussion on the war situation between the two armies. Among them, regarding the situation in Shandong Province on the Jinpu Railway, he said that the Central Army's policy of suppressing the bandits this time was not to drive away the bandit army, but to annihilate them in order to avoid leaving behind troubles. Therefore, it will lure the enemy closer and then launch a fierce attack from land and air to destroy them. Han Fuqu's passing through Jinan was also intended to lure the Jin army south of the Yellow River. If the Jin army goes south from Jinan, the Central Army can crush it to pieces within 48 hours. If they plan to defend Jinan, it will be necessary to besiege it, but there are many foreigners there, which may cause diplomatic problems, so there is no plan to attack Jinan at present. However, if the bandit army thinks of thoroughly holding on, it will be necessary to attack. At that time, foreigners may be warned in advance to take refuge in a safe place. (Electric News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Guide: The train carrying the group of reporters from the Xuzhou Station on the Jinpu Line to the Guide Station on the Longhai Line departed at 3:30 PM on the 3rd. (Electric News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Guide: When I was awakened by the sound of airplanes bombing, our train had arrived in Guide for several hours. This is a large commercial port in eastern Henan Province. Since then, the annual transportation of goods has been 200,000 tons, so the station is very large and there are many lines, which can be called the first on the Longhai Line. Today I will meet with Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek. It is scheduled to depart from Guide to Liu River at 9 AM. (Electric News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Liu River: On the afternoon of the 4th, Chiang Kai-shek said to the reporters under the shade of a large tree in the field near Liuhe Station: "This is the first time I have met with reporters since the expedition." He smiled slightly as he spoke. He also said, "The Central Army on the Longhai Line has occupied strategically important locations and is in a stable position for combat, and the situation is extremely favorable. Since the start of the war, our army has defeated three-quarters of the Northern Army. The Northern Army has long lost its fighting power, and only hopes to hold on to a solid position to delay the time. If it leaves the position, it will undoubtedly be completely destroyed. There is no question that the southward advance of the Shanxi Army proceeding from the Jinpu Line will not succeed. Abandoning Jinan is because the number of Shanxi troops crossing the Yellow River is large, which is a predetermined operation. If the Shanxi Army occupies Qingdao or goes south again and occupies Xuzhou, there is nothing to fear, because our army's plan to lure the enemy is very eager for it to cross the river and go deep. They have no hope of returning alive. The day Yan Xishan arrives in Jinan is the day his fate ends. This can be predicted to you in advance. The protracted indecision of the situation and the sharp drop in silver prices have brought the people's suffering to the extreme. I deeply understand the hope for an early peace, and I also earnestly hope for peace. However, the realization of this goal is almost hopeless. There is no other way but to quickly eliminate the rebel army and end the war as soon as possible. At this time, taking a compromising peaceful solution would only leave future troubles, which we will never adopt. When the Northern Army is exhausted and comes to surrender in the future, how will we deal with it? This matter has not yet been considered, but generally everything will follow the government's opinion. This war is completely different in nature from ordinary meaningless internal strife, because Yan and Feng betrayed the central government and undermined unification, while the central government is aiming to complete the national revolution. This is the final struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, so it must be thoroughly insisted on to the end. A month later, the blue sky and white sun flag of the Central Army will be hung over more than 400 prefectures, and 400 million people will be elated to celebrate the success of the revolution. From then on, China can concentrate on construction without any hindrance. We know nothing but to follow the teachings of the late Prime Minister and advance bravely. Zhang Xueliang has recently assumed the position of Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy and Air Force. Because the central government has sufficient military strength, there is no need to borrow Zhang Xueliang's military strength, so Zhang Fa Liang has not sent troops so far, and there is no other reason. The claim by the Wang Jingwei faction that the central government is an illegal government is completely unfounded nonsense. They are actually rebellious traitors who betrayed the central government." Chiang's face was slightly thin, his eyes were sunken, and his hair was already turning white. The reporters asked Chiang to write a number as a souvenir. Chiang used a fountain pen to write on the back of the reporter's business card: "Final victory, Chiang Kai-shek." (Japan Union News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Xuzhou: In order to accommodate the wounded soldiers, Xuzhou has established 22 wounded soldier hospitals and 5 army hospitals. After these wounded soldiers undergo emergency surgery in Xuzhou, they are sent to various hospitals in the rear. All of them invite actors to perform dramas to comfort the wounded soldiers.

<h3 id="e9">The Portuguese Revolutionary Conspiracy and the Hungarian Restoration Rumor <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>When the world is in a commercial panic, it is appropriate for all non-industrial countries to be able to live in peace. Now, according to what I have heard, a Portuguese revolutionary conspiracy has been discovered, and there is a Hungarian restoration rumor. Why is the world so troubled? In addition, Yugoslavia has publicity about reforming its political system, the Rhine region has German extremist violence, the United States has black and white racial conflict, and the colonies of India and other countries are constantly striving for freedom, not to mention other issues. Therefore, it can be seen that the world's injustice, once triggered, cannot end on its own. If economic pressure and the difficulty of life are added, everyone will want to overthrow the present or find another way in the future, or recall the past and restore the old. This is why the world is in turmoil and has no end.</p>
<p>In short, the source of the world's chaos is nothing more than two things: one is injustice, and the other is a means of living. Only when the two are combined will people be willing to be born into life and death to cause chaos. In the past, those who were oppressed, because of the transmission of history, either recognized oppression as something they deserved and did not think it was unjust. In recent years, this range has been broken by the trend of the times, so injustice can be triggered at any time, and once triggered, it is impossible to eliminate. Moreover, the poverty of life compels it, so no matter how stable a country is, few are not stirred up by these two sources of chaos. It is not easy to hope for world peace and tranquility today.</p>

Then he returned on the same train with the reporter group. Mr. Liu said to the Union News Agency reporter that his mission to the south was to report the truth and process of Zhang Xueliang's past mediation efforts for Yan Feng and others, and to inquire about Chiang Kai-shek's opinions on future issues and to examine the current situation of the war. Zhang Xueliang's opinion on rectifying the situation advocated that Yan Feng should step down first, and the Jin army should be temporarily supervised by Chuan Zuoyi and Zhao Daiwen, and the Feng army should be temporarily supervised by Lu Zhonglin. On the one hand, a national defense conference should be convened to establish regulations regarding the command authority of the national army, so as to prevent troops from being mobilized according to personal will in the future and permanently eliminate the cause of internal strife. Chiang Kai-shek also agreed with this proposal and replied that if Yan Feng stepped down, all other conditions could be agreed to. Therefore, pending the report, the central government will have a concrete statement on the current situation. Furthermore, depending on the development of the situation, there will be a possibility of armed mediation.

<p>Stalin on the Current Situation</p>
<p>Economic Decline of Capitalist Countries</p>
<p>The Danger of War Between Powers is Increasingly Urgent</p>
<p>Moscow - Stalin reported on the international situation at the Congress of the Russian Communist Party, stating that the recent period in the world is not only a turning point for the Soviet Union, but also a turning point for capitalist countries. In the Soviet Union, the economy continues to develop, while in capitalist countries, the economy is declining. The crisis faced by capitalist countries is due to overproduction, which is the first economic crisis that occurred after the war. This crisis has hit various countries at different times with different forces. Industrial countries and agricultural countries cannot escape it, and the United States, the world's largest capitalist country, is particularly affected. The internal antagonism of the capitalist world has therefore become acute, especially between the United States and Britain. The United States and Britain are now fiercely competing to export their goods and capital to South America, China, and various colonies and dependencies as battlefields, and the United States currently enjoys a superior position. Secondly, there is antagonism between the United States and Japan, Germany and France, France and Italy, and Britain and France. This kind of competition for markets, sources of raw materials, and export capital will increase day by day, which means that the danger of war is becoming more and more urgent. The antagonism between the victorious countries and Germany is like a beautiful French hero sitting on the upper seat, holding up the Young Plan with the word "pay" written on it, while Germany is crawling below, bleeding and groaning, reluctantly obeying orders. This is the so-called "Spirit of Locarno." Unless we are crazy, we can imagine that Germany will pay 20,000,000,000,000 marks in the next ten years without causing a serious social and economic crisis. Those French and German politicians may believe in this miracle, but we Bolsheviks do not believe it.</p>

Police from Frankfurt and Kassel have been dispatched, but they have not been able to maintain order. Extremist nationalist groups in Wiesbaden and Flörsheim have echoed the former Rhine separatist movement, attacking those who supported it, causing several serious injuries and countless minor injuries. There are now police standing guard every twenty yards in the streets of Wiesbaden, as if martial law is in effect. The authorities are doing their best to ban the exposure of this kind of violence. Republican newspapers throughout the country also condemned it, saying that it only damages the reputation of the nation. French Foreign Minister Briand has expressed to the German Ambassador to France that this kind of repeated behavior violates the treaties signed between France and Germany. The German ambassador replied that the German government also deeply regrets this and is now doing its best to crack down on it.</p>

<p>Minister of Finance Taniguchi Runs Around for Understanding</p>
<p>Former Minister of the Army Opposes</p>
<p>It is Likely to be Revised Again</p>
<p>Tokyo, Electric News, 6th - Minister of the Navy Takarabe and Chief of the Military Command Taniguchi went to the residence of Prince Fushimi yesterday to wait, and then visited Marshal Togo, seeking understanding for the new national defense plan and the memorial to the Yuan Shuai Fu meeting. According to Marshal Togo and others, since the Chief of the Military Command is confident in the supplementary proposal he has compiled, there is no need to run around and ask for understanding. It is okay to convene an informal meeting of councilors and openly state his beliefs. Minister of the Navy Takarabe was greatly troubled by this. At 4 p.m. yesterday, he invited former Minister Kato and General Okada to his residence, and also invited Chief of the Military Command Taniguchi to hold a four-headed naval meeting until 7:30 p.m., doing his best to request recognition of the Taniguchi plan. However, former Minister Kato had previously opposed it, using his resignation as a bet, so it was not easy to agree. Instead, he said that the Minister of the Navy should not avoid convening a meeting of military councilors, expressing that he could not feel relieved. Later, General Okada mediated, saying that it would be postponed until 10 a.m. today to continue the discussion, and then dispersed.</p>

<p>Silk Prices Fall, Agreement to Maintain</p>
<p>Tokyo, Electric News, 6th - According to a survey by the Spinning Federation, the amount of cotton imported in the first half of the year was 1,975,000 bales, a decrease of 87,000 bales compared with the same period last year, mainly due to reduced labor and other factors that reduced demand. However, due to the fall in silver prices, the import of Chinese cotton increased by more than 20% compared with the same period last year.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Electric News, 6th - The Japanese national silk industry and related parties held a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss maintaining silk prices. Mr. Imai proposed limiting the collection of silkworm eggs and requested approval. The silk association chairman and silkworm breeding association chairman and others agreed to wait for the general meeting to discuss this proposal again. However, it is difficult to realize the price of buying egg paper, and it is advocated that it is better for the silk manufacturing industry to form an alliance not to purchase summer and autumn cocoons. The general opinion is that only silkworm farmers can be persuaded to automatically limit silkworm eggs. The rural provincial authorities also believe that it is impossible to buy egg paper.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Military News on the Jinpu and Longhai Lines <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>He Yaozu Takes Office as Commander-in-Chief of the Jinpu Railway</p>
<p>Central Army on the Longhai Line Also Advances</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence - He Yaozu, Director of the Xuzhou Headquarters, was stationed in Yanzhou. On the 3rd, he received an appointment order issued by Commander-in-Chief Chiang on the 2nd. He Yaozu also serves as Commander-in-Chief of the Jinpu Railway. He has taken office in Yanzhou to command the Jinpu line military affairs. At the moment, the two armies are only in local contact, not in formal fierce battles. According to exploration, the Jin army's southward advance focuses on the west of the Jinpu line on the right wing, but the defense line has not been deployed. It is beneficial to launch a quick attack. The Central Army's setup is complete. Large troops have been added on the Jinpu line and are also connected to the right wing of the Longhai line. He will order a general offensive after the deployment is completed. The generals are also flocking north to visit He to discuss the Jinpu line military affairs.</p>
<p>The war on the Longhai line is now gradually becoming silent again. However, according to military news: (1) The remnants of Liang Guanying's troops in Qixian have been surrounded by the Second Route Army. Liu Zhi is commanding in front of Qixian and Qixian can be captured. (2) A unit of Shi Yousan's troops has bypassed from the north of the Longhai Line to the south of the Longhai Line and has been intercepted by the Central Army. A regiment of troops has been disarmed. Also, the center of gravity of the war is gradually shifting to the Jinpu Line. As the Central Army advances on the Jinpu Line, the Longhai Road will also advance accordingly.</p>
<p>The rear security camp in Xubu dispatched Chief of Staff Tang Zhi to preside over, and it is extremely calm. The banditry in the west of Xuzhou is most rampant in Xiaoxian County. The provincial security office has now appointed Fan Zichun as the commander of bandit suppression in Feng, Dang, and Xiao counties. Fan has come to Xuzhou to go to Xiao to make arrangements for commanding bandit suppression affairs. Early in the morning (the 2nd), a group of bandits suddenly broke into Huangjiwei, 50 miles northwest of Xucheng, and surrounded Huangji Elementary School, taking away students Wu Shibao, Luo Wenwei, Shang Aisong, Wang Shouliang, Yang Qingtai, Wang Yancheng, Mr. Huang, etc. There was also a school employee and two students from a certain middle school in this city. After the guards surrounded and suppressed them, there was a fierce battle. The bandits seized 11 rifles, and shot and killed Zhang Lehua, a student at Huangji Elementary School. The guards Geng Kelin and Li Dewang were wounded by the bandits and have been transported to the city for medical treatment. The county government dispatched a police battalion attached to Shi Lizhai to lead a team to suppress them, but the bandits had already fled, so they are currently being pursued.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Recent Military and Political News from Fujian Province <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence - Lin Zhong, commander of the 1st Brigade of the Marine Corps stationed in Fujian and commander of the provincial defense, resigned from his concurrent positions because he was responsible for the political change on January 6 this year. The general headquarters of the Marine Corps stationed in Fujian transferred him to a senior advisor, and promoted Jin Zhenzhong, commander of the 1st Regiment of the brigade, to brigade commander, and Liu Gangde, commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment, to regimental commander. All of this has been recorded in this newspaper. According to investigation, in addition to Lin Zhong, other naval generals involved in the January 6 political change include Sa Fuchou, commander of the Fujian Port Fortress, and Yu Bangyan, commander of the Ningfu Garrison. Now Sa Fuchou has also resigned, and the Marine Corps headquarters has approved the appointment of Mao Zhencai, chief of the headquarters' staff office, to succeed him. Sa was transferred to an advisor. Yu Bangyan has not yet made any expression as of the most recent time. After Lin and Sa left office, they both secretly lived at home. They did not take up the positions of advisor or counselor. Lin also plans to travel to Taiwan in the next few days. However, recently, there have been rumors that Chen Jiliang, the commander-in-chief of the Marine Corps, has also been very passive since Lin and Sa left. He has indicated that he intends to resign to Yang Shuzhuang. The chiefs of the various departments of the headquarters and the battalion commanders of the 1st Brigade said that Yang Shuzhuang has not been able to return to Fujian during this military period, and the affairs of Fujian province all depend on Chen. If Chen resigns again, no one in the naval agencies and troops in Fujian will be in charge, and actions will inevitably be chaotic. Therefore, they jointly retained him, saying that if Chen is determined to resign, they will all resign together. However, this statement has not been realized. Chen is still going to the headquarters every day as usual to work. Jin Zhenzhong also arrived in the province from Sandu Defense a few days ago and took office at the brigade headquarters in Majiang on the 2nd of this month.</p>
<p>Of the current members of the provincial government, Chen Peikun, Jiang Pingfan, and Lin Jinan, three people were previously appointed by the National Government. Chen Peikun was appointed as the acting chairman of the provincial government and concurrently acting director of the civil affairs and finance departments. Jiang Pingfan was acting director of the construction department, and Lin Jinan was acting director of the education department, temporarily maintaining the transitional period. Now Jiang and Lin have taken office successively, but Chen Peikun has repeatedly declined to take office, but still goes to the government office as usual. It is now becoming increasingly difficult to deal with civil and financial affairs, and he is extremely distressed. He telegraphed Yang Shuzhuang the other day, asking to be dismissed from his original position as a member of the committee and planned to go away for recuperation. Yang said that because he was unable to return to Fujian for a while, he relied entirely on Chen to preside over the affairs of the province and could not allow him to leave. He has replied by telegram to comfort him. However, Chen's attitude is still very passive. (July 2)</p>

<p>A Fuzhou dispatch reports that after the battle of Baisha Ridge, Commander Lu's troops retreated beyond Baisha, and Commander Liu's forces are about to converge. Supervising Commander Fang Shengtao is advancing. Furthermore, Chen Wenlin has twice flown airplanes to Youxikou and Damuxi to drop bombs, all of which hit their targets.

The requisitioned automobiles continue to shuttle back and forth day and night without stopping. On June 30th, Liu Heding again traveled by car to Hongshan Bridge, where he transferred to a steamboat to go to the arsenal and then to the front line in the area of Pulidongkou for inspection. On the morning of the 1st of this month, at 4:00 AM, he again led officers and more than thirty horses to inspect the area between the Big and Small North Ridges outside the North Gate. He returned to the headquarters via the West Gate at around 10:00 AM. More than a thousand northwest prisoners transported from Shanghai have been undergoing training and replenishment in recent days.</p>
<h3 id="e74">True Situation of the Western Fujian Militia Suppressing Communists <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Recapturing Longyan and Bangyang</p>
<p>A Xiamen dispatch from the 4th reports that in western Fujian, communist bandits, led by Deng Zihui of the Longyan Soviet, gathered the First Red Guard Team under Deng Gangyi and the Second Team under Fu Bocui, planning to assist Wu Zhonghe's communist forces under Zhu De in Shanghang to harass Guangdong. They repeatedly attacked Dapu but were repelled by the Guangdong army, suffering heavy losses. They then recruited and replenished forces in Yongding. As a result, the communist forces in the Longyan area are very weak, with only a small number of untrained soldiers from various villages left to guard the counties of western Fujian. Since the local militias in western Fujian have been reorganized and replenished, they have launched attacks on the communist bandits. On the 18th of last month, they recaptured Longyan County. Furthermore, the Zhongmin Militia recaptured Bangyang, Pingtou, and Tiandi on the 23rd. However, the communist disaster in western Fujian has been going on for a long time, and the telegraph lines have all been cut, with bandits everywhere and traffic blocked. As a result, the true situation is difficult to ascertain. One report says that the militia withdrew from Yan City on the 20th due to being isolated, but this has not been confirmed by official reports. Now, we have received a telegram from western Fujian about suppressing bandits, detailing the recapture of Longyan and Bangyang. We are recording the original telegram as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Liu Liebo, Head of the Yanshi Militia, telegram to Lin, Magistrate of Longyan: "Communist bandits are rampant, and the people of Yan are not at peace. Today, my troops departed from Subang to Yanshi to suppress the communist bandits. Our army attacked the enemy at dawn. More than 500 enemy rebels relied on dangerous terrain to resist stubbornly. After our army advanced bravely, the enemy could not withstand and fled in disarray towards Dongping Pass. In this battle, about 70 to 80 enemy soldiers were killed, more than 50 rifles were seized, and more than 20 enemy soldiers were captured. In addition to dispatching teams to search and pursue, this is reported to you and please forward to the superiors to quickly allocate ammunition to facilitate military operations." "Another telegram" Today, Zhi led more than 300 troops to depart from Yanshi and advance towards Yan City. The vanguard met the enemy at Dongping Pass and exchanged fire. Our army charged forward, and the enemy began to collapse. The enemy rebels employed many tricks and laid many ambushes along the way. Fortunately, our army was familiar with the terrain and attacked step by step, and were not trapped. At 2:00 PM, the enemy collapsed towards Longmen, and our army occupied Yan City. In this battle, about 50 to 60 enemy soldiers were killed, and more than 20 rifles and many military items were seized. However, my troops have fought the enemy repeatedly, and ammunition is very scarce, with each soldier having less than ten rounds. Although Yan City has been obtained, the enemy rebels are stirring up trouble on all sides. My troops are weak and cannot hold out for long. I am forced to telegraph to you, my lord, requesting you to send troops to reinforce and provide ammunition to boost morale and solidify our defense. I await your orders with trepidation."</p>
<p>(2) Magistrate of Longyan's reply to Head of the Liu Militia (titles omitted): "I have received your telegram. Your militia has braved the summer heat and launched attacks to suppress the communist bandits, winning many victories and capturing many prisoners, which has deterred the bandits in the city. Your martial labor is worthy of admiration. After receiving the news, this magistrate immediately telegraphed the Fujian Bandit Suppression Headquarters and the Provincial Government, and also discussed with the stationed army and the First Security Detachment to attack Yangbang and advance towards the county seat, and informed the Longtan and Fushi militias to launch guerrilla attacks towards Kanshi and Tiandi as reinforcements. Yangbang, Lantian, Shanpingtou and other places have been recaptured one after another, and are now advancing towards the Makeng area. The food for the officers and soldiers of the troops and the first district militia has been prepared and maintained nearby. As for the lack of ammunition, I have telegraphed the Provincial Government, the Fujian Bandit Suppression Headquarters, and General Sa to provide assistance. I hope you will continue to report the situation there by telegram to Magistrate Lin Kan Yin."</p>
<p>(3) The First Security Detachment reports the capture of Yangbang in a telegram: "Our Guo Battalion arrived in Yang on a certain day and went to the front to observe the situation for several days. Today, we attacked Yangbang together. Our Guo Battalion was responsible for the right wing, and our engineering battalion was responsible for the left wing. Our troops and the militias of various villages surrounded from the rear. We departed at 6:00 AM. The bandits were divided, half defending the towers stubbornly, and half relying on the mountains for support. After our army arrived, we fired seven and five shells at the Keto Tower, hitting four shells. More than ten mortar shells were fired, most of which also hit. At 10:00 AM, we broke through the tower and the bandits fled behind the mountain. We immediately divided our forces to pursue them. There were still two towers where the bandits were resisting stubbornly. Our army braved death and charged to the front of the tower, destroyed the gate, and the entire tower burned, and the bandits were burned to death. We heard their cries, which were estimated to be about thirty bandits inside. Our troops surrounded from the rear and engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits in Lixing Mountain. The bandits could not withstand and collapsed to the rear. Our troops followed and pursued them, and the bandits stationed in Tiandi, Shanpingtou, Lantian, Shimenlu and other places came to reinforce separately. Our troops fought them separately. After about an hour, the bandits suffered dozens of casualties and collapsed to the rear. Our troops pursued them to Shanpingtou, and another group pursued them to Lantian. These two places were also recovered one after another." End of telegram.</p>

I am very grateful to Minister Sun of the Ministry of Railways for his enthusiastic leadership in this port construction, and grateful to the central government for resolutely approving the port construction contract, and grateful to Mr. Hughes, the British engineer who initially selected Huludao Port, for the achievements of today. I have mediocre talents and dared not shoulder this important task, but I have been forced to do my best due to my duties. Fortunately, the entire project will still take five or six years, and perhaps outstanding talents will emerge to manage it in the future. I am also happy to fulfill my national duty by making a slight effort at the beginning of this project. (To be continued)</p>

It has been suggested for several years and resolved to build a public sports ground in Guangdong Province.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Summary of Important News <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>To reclaim the wasteland of the East Parade Ground that has been sold by the government to merchants and civilians by paying for it. In addition, a preparatory committee for the public sports ground was established, and Xu Chongqing, Jin Zencheng, Lin Yungai, Chen Ce, Qiu Jixiang and other nine people were appointed as preparatory committee members. This matter was interrupted for a long time due to political and military influences. The committee members recently felt the urgency of promoting sports in eastern Guangdong and brought up the old matter again. A meeting was specially convened by the committee on the first of this month to discuss and decide on specific methods for construction of the sports ground. The results of the meeting that day were: (1) Land Acquisition Methods: (A) Determining the land to be acquired: The committee proposed to acquire a plot of land totaling approximately 9,645 Hua Jing and 20 square feet. (B) Establishing Boundaries: According to the original blueprint of the Department of Finance, a red line will be used as the boundary line, and boundary stones will be erected every ten zhang.

<p>The Zhejiang Relief Association purchased 50,000 shi of cheap rice to provide relief to various counties. Since May, nearly 40,000 shi of cheap rice have been distributed to various counties. The remaining rice, approximately 10,000 shi, has been approved for distribution by the end of this month and will not be continued. This is because the new grain (early rice) in various counties will be harvested in early August. It is also reported that the cheap rice purchased this time was issued according to the purchase price, and the depreciation loss was quite large, requiring more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Department of Construction found that construction projects in the southern part of the province were relatively few, so it organized an inspection team, hiring experts or assigning professionals from affiliated agencies to serve as inspectors. The inspection area is divided into three zones: the Oujiang River Basin as the first zone, the coastal counties as the second zone, and the upper reaches of the Qiantang River as the third zone. The inspection items are transportation, agriculture, geology, mining, water conservancy, and industry and commerce. The inspection period is tentatively set for three months.</p>
<p>The Provincial Highway Bureau submitted a request to the Department of Construction to establish a temporary repair shop, requiring approximately 23,000 yuan. It asked whether it could be approved to allocate funds for establishment and designated as a purely business organization. The proposal has been submitted to the Provincial Government Committee for deliberation and included in the budget for the 19th year. The Department of Finance has been notified to begin organization.</p>
<p>In May, Cantonese merchant Li Jiyun was kidnapped by bandits at the Yinma Bridge in Longjing, West Lake. The provincial government has issued an order to arrest and rescue the hostage, but two months have passed and the case has not been solved. Now, the Shanghai Cantonese Overseas Chinese Business Federation has telegraphed the provincial government again, requesting urgent arrest and resolution.</p>
<p>The Department of Finance found that the public expenditure budgets collected by various counties in Zhejiang Province were inconsistent due to their complexity. It has drafted a unified collection and expenditure method proposal and submitted it to the Provincial Government Committee for review and approval. It will be implemented after revision and passage.

<p>Robbed after being Forced to Lend: Yao Ahai, a farmer from Shanlu River West, north of the Kong Family Shrine, received a threatening letter from Tai Bao Ashu on the morning of May 23rd, sent by his subordinates Xi Daoming and Dai Kechang (more than a dozen households near the Kong Family Shrine received threatening letters on the same day). The letter clearly stated that they were borrowing 2,000 yuan in military pay and demanded that it be prepared within three days and paid at the Jiang Family Tea House in Henan, Wanchun Bridge. Ahai could not raise the money in time and failed to comply with the request. On the 30th, those people came again with many people to demand payment, all wearing box cannons and carrying several boxes of kerosene, claiming that if the money was not paid, they would burn down the house. Ahai was terrified and begged repeatedly, and finally agreed to pay 800 yuan to settle the matter. Unexpectedly, not long after, on the night of the 2nd of this month, three bandit ships came with more than 20 bandits, all carrying guns and weapons. They rushed in and tied up the family members one by one, severely tortured and beat them, and forced them to hand over silver dollars. Ahai was the most seriously injured and his life was in danger. Dozens of shi of soybeans, wheat, rapeseed, etc., as well as silver dollars, ornaments, clothes, quilts, and all utensils were robbed, causing great losses. Then they boarded the ship fully loaded and left.</p>

<p>Change of Funding for the County Labor and Agricultural Farm: The funding for the county labor farm has been stagnant since the budget was revised last year. Now that the 19th year has begun, the funding for the farm should be discussed and decided to maintain it. At the county administrative meeting the other day, there were discussions on the funding for the county labor farm and agricultural farm. Should the existing 3,040 yuan of county tax funding for the county labor farm, 846 yuan for the former agricultural farm nursery, and 440 yuan for the former farmers' association be stopped uniformly according to the order of the department, and all funding for the labor farm and agricultural farm be changed to be paid from the special construction fund and the agricultural improvement mu loss item, so as to free up 4,326 yuan of county tax to make up for the insufficient expenditure of other county funds? The discussion resulted in a resolution that the construction bureau's funding that originally had provincial subsidies had been ordered to stop, and the county's revenue from the county construction fee was also insufficient to allocate. The funding for the county labor farm should be reduced in scope and still subsidized by 100 yuan per month under the county tax item to maintain it. The original allocation of 1,286 yuan for the agricultural farm under the county tax item should be stopped entirely. The funding for the farm should be paid from the agricultural improvement mu loss item in accordance with the order of the department. The county will compile a transformation budget and submit it to the county for compilation.</p>
<p>Hunan Refugees Leave Song Today: The other day, approximately 300 Hunanese refugees came to Song from Xinqiao along the railway and stayed in the Huayang Bridge area outside the East Gate, occupying places such as Ziyang Palace and Dongchan Temple. The so-called refugee leaders were all dressed in luxurious clothes and used expensive items. Huayang Town Chief Xu Chunbo gathered 40 to 50 yuan and 3 shi of rice to provide food, but it was still not enough to satisfy their desires. Town Chief Xu personally requested the county government to send a police team to drive them away. This morning, they left Song on foot towards Jiashan.</p>

<p>Detailed Account of the Solved Kidnapping Case: Details of the case in which Yang Shusen, the captain of the second police squad of the county, solved the kidnapping case and rescued the hostages. Captain Yang of the squad was investigating very carefully since the kidnapping case of the Lu family in Zhuangxing occurred. On the 3rd of this month, a scout reported that the house of Su Agui at No. 29, Zhugang Dongtan, four li away from the town, had seen many pieces of washed children's clothes every morning. When asked, the neighbors said that the house had no children. Thinking that traces could be found, he led 20 police officers at 3:30 AM that night, braving the rain to rush to the location. He first surrounded the residence, and then ordered the squad leader wearing a steel wire vest and six police officers to rush into the inner bedroom. The bandit Wang Ahe, who was guarding the hostages, had already heard the noise and got up to resist with a gun. Fortunately, the squad leader was quick and captured him. At the same time, the other two bandits were also captured by the police one after another, and no one escaped. All five hostages were hidden in the side room in the east, in the pit house firewood room. Captain Yang personally rescued them and escorted them to Zhuangxing before dawn on the 4th, and then transferred them to the Nanhua Brigade headquarters to await interrogation. It is now known that the county magistrate Shen has sent Ding Zhiyan from the brigade to hold a preliminary hearing yesterday afternoon. Su Agui confessed that he was 22 years old and a native of the county. Last month, he and 17 others formed a partnership, called for two ships, had five handguns, went to Liuzhi Town, Kunshan County to kidnap two Zhou family members, and then kidnapped three Chen family members in Zhangpu Town. Ten days ago, they secretly transported them to the countryside and hid them. He just returned from Shanghai yesterday and was completely unprepared. Wang A'er (the monk), who was watching the ticket, confessed that he lived in Nanhui and worked in a yarn factory in Caojiadu, Shanghai. This time, Su Agui and Su A'mei called him on the first day of this month, gave him a handgun to watch the tickets. He heard that the old class of Agui belonged to Cao Amu of Caoging. Shen Youdi confessed that he lived in Xuejiaqiao Town, Qingpu, met Su and others in Yaodabang, and invited him to come and watch the three little tickets. It was agreed that he would be paid 100 yuan for the job. As for the two tickets of the Zhou family, they were watched by Wang Ahe. There was also a female bandit, who initially confessed to He Aizhen, but later changed her name to Xu A'mei. Her words were disjointed. She said that she was from Songjiang and was lured by Su Agui. After interrogating the hostages, Zhou Jinqing confessed that he lived in the countryside of Liuzhi Town, Kunshan County, was 68 years old, and his mailing address was at Hongfu Teagarden in the town. His family was not rich and made a living by farming. He had only one son named Yongkang. This time, the bandits kidnapped his grandson Wenwei. Because he resisted desperately, he was kidnapped here together for about ten days. The bandits told him that his family had entrusted someone to negotiate the price, but no agreement had been reached. Chen Kechang, Chen Keliang, and Chen Keyan confessed that they lived in Zhangpu Town, Kunshan County, about ten li away from the city, and were brothers of the same clan. They were fourteen or nine years old. Their father was named Chen Zhengbao and made a living by farming. When they were kidnapped, the bandits used handguns to force them to board the ship. At first, they were hidden in the bow of the ship and were not allowed to make any noise or visit. They shook for four or five days before arriving at Su's house and were imprisoned in the bedroom in the back house for ten days. Usually the bandits came and went a lot, and at night they were accompanied by bandits for surveillance. He still remembered that the Su bandit said when he went to Shanghai a few days ago that if his family did not redeem them, he would tear up the ticket, and ordered me to take off my clothes and be beaten. Now, please notify Kong Dayuan Nanhua store in Zhangpu Town to inform their family to come and collect them. After interrogation, Ding, the captain of the brigade, in addition to detaining the three bandits Su, Wang, and Shen in the county, asked the Kunshan County Government and each family to prepare documentary evidence to await identification and return. As for the female bandit, after an interrogation, it was found that she had nothing to do with the kidnapping case and could have been released. However, because her confessions were inconsistent, the Songjiang County Government was asked to investigate the woman's family before verifying the facts. Captain Yang was commended by County Magistrate Shen Qingkang for solving the major case repeatedly and for his hard work.</p>

<p>Record of Interrogation in the Gunning Down of Tan Qixuan Case: Tan Qixuan, the former head of the Beishang Township Administrative Bureau in Xiyi, was tragically shot and killed by bandits on April 1st of last year. Subsequently, the county authorities arrested Bao Dayuan, Lü Genhu, Guo Asi, Guo Ada, and Sun Junxi, the former head of the county party headquarters' propaganda department, and Lü Shiqiao, a clerk, who were all involved in the case. They were interrogated and detained by the county. A few days ago, police officers were dispatched to the township to arrest Chen Yangong and Yu Yaocheng, two people related to the case, and brought them to the county. Tang Yiqin, a member of the committee for clearing accumulated cases, opened a court session and summoned them for interrogation. Chen Yangong was found to be unrelated and was released on bail in court. Yesterday afternoon, at about 1 p.m., Tan Zhongying (Tan Qixuan's father), the plaintiff, and Pu Xiehan, a witness, were summoned, and the defendants in custody were brought in for questioning. First, Tan Zhongying testified, "My son Qixuan went out with Lü Shiqiao on April 1st to collect donations. After lunch at Lü's house, he said goodbye and returned.</p>
<p>On the way, he was shot by bandits with a pistol.</p>
<p>After falling to the ground, he was carried to the administrative bureau, where he told me, 'I fell into Lü Shiqiao's trap.' He also said that there were four bandits, and he only recognized Bao Dayuan," and then he was sent to the hospital by boat, but he died before he could be rescued. Next, Bao Dayuan, Lü Genhu, Guo Asi, and Zhu Ada were interrogated. Except for Bao Dayuan, who still claimed that after the meeting in Songshan, Lü Shiqiao met him on the road and ordered him to shoot and kill Tan Qixuan, which he refused to do, the others were vague and unwilling to tell the truth. Next, Sun Junxi testified that he had applied to the High Court for a change of jurisdiction and therefore refused to make a statement. Next, Lü Shiqiao testified that he and Qixuan had always been on good terms and that he had no intention of seizing his position as director or murdering him. Then, the witness Pu Xiehan was questioned. Next, Yu Yaocheng testified that he was detained in the detention center for a case when Tan Qixuan was killed, so he did not know anything about it. After the interrogation, Tan Zhongying and Pu Xiehan were ordered to return home, and Yu Yaocheng was released on bail. Bao Dayuan, Lü Shiqiao, Sun Junxi, Lü Genhu, Guo Asi, Zhu Ada, and others were all returned to custody to await further interrogation and judgment.</p>
<p>Chen Lunkui Declared Not Guilty: Chen Lunkui, a native of Anzhen, Xiyi, once served as an instructor in the Huaixia urban district party headquarters in the 16th year of the Republic of China. Because of his upright words and deeds, he aroused jealousy from certain parties and was falsely accused of being a counter-revolutionary suspect. He was wanted by the authorities. At the end of last year, Chen Lunkui was arrested in Rugao by the rural cleanup bureau and sent to the Suzhou High Court for trial. Recently, after investigation by the Procuratorate of the High Court, it was confirmed that there was no suspicion of counter-revolution, and it was decided not to prosecute him and release him in court. He has already returned to Xiyi.</p>
<p>Pheasant Prostitutes Detained for Interrogation: More than ten houses along the city wall outside the Guangfu Gate of Xiyi are inhabited by wild chickens (i.e., pheasant prostitutes). It is common to see them soliciting customers along the way. The Second Public Security Branch is nearby, but it has not been heard that they have been cracked down on. Recently, a large number of people from other places have come to the town, and some of them spend all day there for pleasure, which is related to the local public order. County Magistrate Sun Zuji and Public Security Bureau Chief Huang Zhenbai were aware of this situation and, on the afternoon of the 5th, ordered Sun Rongding, the chief of the Second Public Security Branch in charge, to send police officers to arrest ten people, including the old pimp Luo Fagen, the pheasant prostitutes Wang Lanzhen, Luo Pengshi, Zhu Jinmei, Shi Qiaoyun, Jin'e, Wang Yuehong, and Yu Xiaomei, Zhu Xiaomei. They were taken to the County Public Security Bureau to await orders.</p>

<p>False Accusation Against the Head of the Defense Corps: County Magistrate Li Leng received an express letter from Changzhou on June 6th, sent by Ligang Township, in which Wang Jie, who gave his name, filed a complaint accusing Ling Hesheng, the head of the Ding Taosha Defense Corps, and squad leader Huan Da of colluding with bandits north of the Yangtze River. County Magistrate Li then ordered Cao Weihan, the chief of the Houmei Sixth Public Security Branch, to investigate. It turned out that there was no such person as the plaintiff Wang Jie, and Ling Hesheng and others had no suspicion of colluding with bandits. The case was reported to the general bureau and then to the county for handling. On the same day, Corps Leader Ling also went to the county to explain the situation. The clerk Shen Jizhou met him and, since there was no relation to the case, ordered him to return.</p>
<p>Bureau Chief Slaps Subordinate, Who Commits Suicide Out of Resentment: Yang Xueying, the chief of the Second Public Security Branch of Houtang, has been incompatible with the patrol officers since taking office due to his stubborn personality. The other day, he slapped the patrol officer Li Ali six three times over a trivial matter. Li committed suicide out of resentment. Yesterday (the 5th), his younger brother filed a complaint with the county government accusing Chief Yang of coercion and requesting that someone be sent to the countryside to conduct an autopsy. After County Magistrate Li received the complaint, he immediately sent judicial secretary Lu Baoguang and coroner Cao to the countryside to conduct an autopsy.</p>
<p>Opening of Rice Sales to Relieve the Poor: The county government held a meeting on maintaining food supplies for the people on the 5th and resolved: (1) The deficit of 20,000 yuan for grain reserves must be paid by 9 a.m. on the 10th by Director Shen of the Finance Bureau and the director of the Xia Kuanshan Office, who shall be fully responsible for this. (2) The price of rice sold should be 2 yuan per picul. (3) The date for the opening of rice sales in urban and rural areas will be the 20th. (4) Donations from each district must be submitted to the association before July 20th.</p>
<p>The Truth of the Zhu Tingyu Case Is Difficult to Ascertain: On the 30th of last month, the investigation team arrested Zhu Tingyu, Zhu Ronggui, Xiao Yunzhang, and three other suspicious persons in the Lu Family Garden in the city. After interrogation by the county bureau, no definite confession was obtained. Yesterday (the 5th), Wu Shanbao, who was sent to Shanghai by the investigation team to investigate, returned to Cheng and reported that there was no Yufeng Lumber Company or Hong Baosheng in Xiaojiadu, and no Kang Shuitian in Huile Lane. The telegram from Zhu Tingyu, Zhu Kongwen, has denied sending a letter, which shows that Zhu and others are definitely not good people. After seeing the report in the newspaper, the Shanghai General Patrol House sent Chief Inspector Feng Shuofu of the General Investigation Department to Cheng yesterday to investigate whether Zhu Tingyu and others were related to the tragic murder of seven lives in the Guo residence on Avenue Edward VII. After confirming that there was no connection, he returned to Shanghai to report. However, the nature of Zhu Tingyu's crimes is now being investigated in detail by the investigation team, which has been transferred to the judiciary.</p>

<p>Banditry Rampant at the Junction of Tonghai: In recent days, a large number of bandits have gathered and rioted in the Erzhen area at the junction of Nantong and Haimen counties, killing defense corps police officers and forcing villagers to join the pseudo-Red Army. The Anti-Bandit Command Headquarters of the Nine Counties in the North has mobilized a large detachment of Yu Shimei's troops to suppress them. The Trial of the Tragic Death of the Owner of the Automobile Company: Jiang Chuntang, the owner of the Lu Shun Automobile Company in the new market south of the city, was beaten to death by the county police team due to a conflict over the sealing of hired vehicles. The case was opened for trial by the Criminal Court of the County Court on the 5th. Jiang Chen, the wife of the deceased, stated the circumstances of her husband's tragic death. The defendants Liang Qinghai and Wang Hongchen gave very cunning confessions. Special Affairs Chief Zhao Changyi was present in court and ordered Liang and Wang to be detained pending further summons.</p>
<p>Police Officers Oppose Misappropriation of Public Security Land Tax: The police officers of the entire county of Tongyi unanimously opposed the allocation and use of the collected public security land tax for other agencies and requested the County Political Affairs Conference to reconsider and correct the situation so that no agency could misappropriate the funds. Rugao</p>
<p>Memorial Service for Fallen Police Officers in Shizhuang: Yesterday, all sectors of Shizhuang held a memorial service at Shizhuang Elementary School to commemorate the county police officers who died in Shizhuang. After the police public sacrifice, the team marched out and sent the memorial tablets of the martyrs to the City God Temple for placement. Along the way, they shouted slogans. Guests freely donated 400 yuan, and it was decided to provide 200 yuan in consolation to the family of squad leader Liu Han and 100 yuan to the police officers, which have now been distributed to their families.</p>
<p>Frequent Bandit Disasters in the Southwest: Zhang Wansheng, a resident of Guandi Temple in Hedong Township, opened a butcher shop. Last night, forty or fifty bandits came and severely beat his wife, killing her by hitting her head with a box cannon. His younger brother, Wanxuan, was dragged out and killed with knives, sticks, and gunshots. Cheng Jiasheng, who lived nearby and collected eggs, and Zhang Laocha of Shaojia Village, who worked as a matchmaker, were both suspected of being spies by the bandits and shot to death.

<p>Collapse of the Liuyi Riverbank Injures People: Liuyi (i.e., Jiaxing Bridge) on the opposite bank of Zhenjiang is an important junction for ferries and automobiles. Yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m., the Puji Ferry was carrying dozens of passengers and was sailing across the river, heading straight for the north bank. When it was about ten feet away from the dock, the riverbank suddenly collapsed with a loud noise. A section of the bank two feet wide and ten feet long collapsed, and the waves rose high, overtopping the ship's mast and causing the Puji Ferry to capsize and lie sideways in the river. The bow of the ship had already sunk, and the situation was extremely dangerous. Fortunately, the driver had foresight and used full reverse gear to turn the ship upright. However, seven or eight passengers standing by the side of the ship preparing to disembark were swept away by the waves, and Wang Xiaokouzi, the ship's tea attendant, also disappeared at the same time. The seats in the ship's large dining room were broken, the decorations were damaged, and the railings on the second floor deck were broken and destroyed. It will require major repairs. After escaping danger, the ship limped back to the Liujiyuan Wharf and reported the incident to the manager's office. Automobile ferry services have also been suspended pending the restoration of the ship. Chief Zhu, the Jiaxing Bridge water police officer, is currently hiring people to salvage objects and asking people to claim them.</p>

<p>Two Bandit Cases: The family of Chen Changshan, a farmer in Guangfeng Township under the county's jurisdiction, had a boy kidnapped by bandits last month. Due to the difficulty of raising a large sum of money, he has not been redeemed to this day. The night before last, five bandits armed with guns broke into his house and demanded that he quickly prepare 5,000 yuan to redeem the boy, threatening to tear up the ticket if he was late. After saying this, they fired their guns and left. The night before last, seven or eight bandits suddenly came to the Three Hundred and Sixth Village under the county's jurisdiction and searched every house, and no one was spared. It is said that the losses were huge.</p>
<p>Tragic News Amidst Rising Rice Prices: A Jin woman in Jinjia Township under the county's jurisdiction has been widowed for many years. She has elderly parents-in-law above her and five children below. The entire family of eight depends on meager property for a living. However, in recent times, rice and firewood have become increasingly expensive, and life has become increasingly difficult. The Jin woman suddenly had a pessimistic thought and went to a noodle shop to buy several catties of flour. She secretly mixed arsenic into the flour and made cakes, which they ate together. After a while, they all died from the poison. It is indeed tragic.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>Expansion of the Hezhou Security Team: Jiang Zhaozhou, the battalion commander of the Third Battalion of the Seventh Regiment of the Hezhou Security Team, has now received orders from his superiors to expand into a four-company system. The original Seventh and Ninth Companies of the Third Battalion have been incorporated into the First Battalion. However, the Eighth Company has been changed to the Tenth Company of the Third Battalion. The remaining Ninth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Companies have been reassigned from the directly subordinate companies of the First Battalion and the regimental headquarters. The reorganization has been completed. The Third Battalion headquarters and the Tenth Company under its jurisdiction are stationed at the Xuanmiao Temple in Jiaxing. The Ninth Company is stationed at the Jingyan Temple. The Eleventh Company has been sent to Jiashan to take over the defense. The Twelfth Company will be transferred from Hangzhou to Hezhou in the near future to strengthen the defense.</p>
<p>Problems with District Office Expenses: The expenses of the district offices in Jiaxing cannot be carried out due to the lack of funds. It is learned that the 15th County Political Affairs Conference has resolved to use two jiao per liang of the local surtax and three jiao per shi of the surtax on the Jin as compensation from the 19th year onwards. It is said that the matter has been submitted to the Civil and Financial Departments for approval and will be announced soon. However, the owners of various businesses believe that the surtax on the local compensation Jin has exceeded the positive number, and there have always been funds for handling autonomy. Now, instead of reclaiming the original autonomous items, five jiao is added to the land tax compensation Jin, which increases the burden on the people and is not in line with the intention of cherishing the people's difficulties. Therefore, they plan to jointly telegraph the province to request that the county be ordered to exempt the additional surtax and, on the one hand, recover the original district funds for distribution to benefit autonomy.</p>
<p>A Case of Murdering Her Husband Discovered in the Tanghui District: Zheng Aisheng, 30 years old, from Niaoqiao Village, Tanghui, west of the ferry crossing (i.e., across the river from the Tanghui Public Security Branch), has a wife named Shen Youlan who has been unfaithful by nature and has had an affair with Peng Xiaomei from Taizhou for many years. The neighbors all know about it. Because Zheng is there, it is very inconvenient. The other night, the adulterous couple took advantage of Zun's sound sleep and stabbed Zheng's throat and chest twice with a knife, killing him. The Tanghui Public Security Branch heard about it and immediately ordered the police to go to the scene for an inspection. Shen Youlan was arrested, but Peng Xiaomei had already fled without a trace. The matter was immediately reported to the local branch court for an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that the deceased had a knife wound on his chest and throat, and there were also toxic substances in his abdomen. The adulterous woman Shen Youlan has been taken back to the court for strict interrogation, and Peng Xiaomei, the adulterous man, is being strictly hunted down and brought to justice for interrogation.</p>

<p>The List of the Third Construction Committee Has Been Determined: The term of the second county construction committee has expired, and the county government convened all fixed committee members on the 30th of last month to elect the members of the third appointment. As a result, Chen Songhe, Ding Pengling, Xu Guoren, Yao Jiafu, and Chen Yixin were elected. The county has now issued letters of appointment urging them to take office.</p>
<p>Provincial Order to Dismiss the Sixth District Chief: Chen Baichuan, the sixth district chief, was repeatedly accused by the village chiefs, neighborhood chiefs, deputies, and fellow villagers in Shanghai of being incompatible with the local situation. The county forwarded the accusations to the provincial department, and yesterday it received instructions from the Department of Civil Affairs to dismiss the district chief because his unconstrained actions were a major obstacle to the future of autonomy. Wang Youguang, the district chief of Kaihua County, will replace him. In addition, he will be expelled from the school and the fees for books and supplies will be recovered. The county government has commissioned Zhu Shaoguang, the former autonomous committee member of Hengtang District, to temporarily take over the position. The Problem of Candidates for the Southern Unification Association: The candidates for the county and city merchants' unified organization committee must be recommended by the highest-level party headquarters of each city and county in accordance with the organization law. It is learned that the county executive committee has received the recommendation methods issued by the provincial merchants' organization unification committee, which contains 15 articles. The selection of candidates in this county will be discussed and decided after the provincial special commissioner Zheng Wei arrives in Yu.</p>

<p>He Runzhang Serves as Acting Head of the Social Affairs Section: Chen Xuan, the head of the Social Affairs Section of the Ningbo Municipal Government, went to Hankou with former Mayor Luo some time ago to serve as an important position in the Management Bureau. The vacancy has not been filled. Since Mayor Yang believes that the position of head of the Social Affairs Section is important, and Chen has not formally requested to resign, the lack of a permanent person in charge will inevitably delay important public affairs. Therefore, yesterday he specially appointed He Runzhang as a clerk in the Social Affairs Section and served as the acting head of the section.</p>
<p>Standard for Rickshaw Prices Determined: The Municipal Unified Rickshaw Price Committee held its second meeting on May 3rd. Zhang Cizhuang and four others discussed and stipulated that the rickshaw price per li should be temporarily set at (1) ten copper coins per municipal li; (2) even if it is less than one municipal li, it should be calculated as one municipal li; (3) in special circumstances, it may be adjusted according to the situation.

<p>Ministry of Education Stipulates the Length of Medical Studies</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has stipulated the length of study and practice for the pre-medical and undergraduate programs of medical colleges. In addition to issuing notices and instructions to various universities and special municipalities, it has also ordered the education departments of various provinces to investigate medical education matters, which are of utmost importance. It is necessary to determine the study procedures to be followed. The ministry has now stipulated that students of university medical colleges must have a high school diploma before entering the two-year pre-medical program before entering the undergraduate program. This type of pre-medical program is managed by the university's college of science. This is an independent medical college or in special circumstances (such as the university does not have a college of science or the college of science and the medical college are far apart), its pre-medical program may be requested to be affiliated with other university colleges of science. When it is unavoidable, it may also be set up in the college. During the five years of undergraduate studies, there is one year of internship. All university medical colleges and independent medical colleges should follow these regulations. In addition to issuing notices and distributing them, it is hereby ordered that the relevant department forward this order to all provincial and private universities and independent medical colleges in the province for compliance.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Moves Up Summer Office Hours</p>
<p>Various ministries and departments under the government, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have already moved up their office hours last week.

<p>Students of University-Affiliated High Schools Must Not Be Exempt from Entrance Exams</p>

In addition to issuing instructions to various universities, it has also notified the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to investigate the abolition of preparatory courses in universities. When it is unavoidable, they are allowed to run affiliated senior high schools, which were originally established to help students enter higher education. However, after graduation, students must not be exempt from examinations and directly enter their respective universities. They must still be treated the same as other high school graduates, and go through the entrance examination to select the best candidates to ensure fairness and prevent abuse. In addition to issuing notices and distributing them, it is hereby ordered that the relevant department forward this order to all provincial and private universities in the province for compliance.</p>

<p>Zhejiang Province Reappoints Two Middle School Principals</p>
<p>The principal of Zhejiang Provincial Senior High School has always been concurrently held by Chiang Menglin, the president of Zhejiang University. Because of his heavy duties, Chiang is unable to take care of both positions and plans to resign soon. It is heard that the Department of Education believes that Lin Xiao, the director of academic affairs of the school, is a graduate of Peking University and has served as the magistrate of Cixi County. Once approved by the provincial government, he will be appointed to take over the position to achieve familiarity with the work. It is also said that since Jiang Yingchu took over Zhejiang Provincial Fifth High School, the teaching affairs and training have been put in order. Recently, due to a strike by the teachers and staff of the school's affiliated elementary school, he suddenly had the intention of resigning and submitted a request to resign. It is said that the Department of Education intends to appoint Qian Xinai to succeed him.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Department of Education has additionally appointed Zhu Wenzhi as the department's supervisor.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Education Department Reorganizes Joint County Middle Schools</p>
<p>The joint county-run secondary schools in the former Jinhua, Wenzhou, and Taizhou prefectures in Zhejiang Province are mostly in financial straits and difficult to manage. Except for the former Jinhua County-run Bawai Women's Middle School, which has a board of directors responsible for maintaining operations and is achieving good results, the other joint schools in the former Wenzhou and Taizhou prefectures have found it particularly difficult to maintain operations because the board of directors has not yet been organized. In order to reorganize these schools, the Education Department issued orders to the counties yesterday, requiring them to follow the measures for establishing secondary schools in cities and counties during the summer vacation to organize a board of directors to assist and seek development.</p>
<p>List of Students to Study Abroad in Hubei Province Announced</p>
<p>Five Students Officially Selected, Four Students as Alternates</p>
<p>The examination for students to study abroad in Hubei Province was held in early June of this year. It is learned that the Provincial Department of Education has completed the evaluation of the examination papers and selected five students for official admission and four students as alternates. The list is as follows: (Five Officially Selected) Chen Li, British Education; Jin Guozhen, Japanese Municipal Administration; Huo Bingquan, British Physics; Tu Changwang, British Geography; Li Jiaguang, Belgian Applied Chemistry; (Four Alternates) Zhang Zhongjun, British Geography; Tu Yuncheng, British Water Conservancy Engineering; Zhao British Shipbuilding; Ye Jiahui, British Physics.</p>

<p>Situation of Change of Principal at Zhenjiang Middle School</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Middle School was reorganized after the revolution and hired Xue Deyi as the principal. For the past three years, the school's performance has been quite good among provincial schools. The principal was elected as the standing committee member of the Secondary School Joint Association. Because the joint association represents public opinion, many of its proposals for reforming education have angered the educational administrative authorities. Last time, when the middle school principals hosted a banquet for the Director of Education at the Xinxin Restaurant in Zhenjiang, Principal Xue said in his speech that he was not afraid of amateurs doing things, but that he should humbly study and recruit talents. He cited the example of the Director of Agriculture and Mining, who claimed to be an amateur but was able to recruit specialized talents and achieve outstanding results. The Department of Education received a subtle lesson. Now that Principal Xue's term of appointment has expired, a new principal has been appointed. The telegram of welcome from Principal Xue of Zhenzhong to the new principal is recorded below.</p>
<p>Telegram from Principal Xue of Zhenzhong to the new principal: "Mr. Zhongmin, transferred from the Nanjing Legislative Yuan, I have been in charge of Zhenzhong for three years and am exhausted. I am eager to rest. I have read the provincial government meeting records and am pleased to see that you have been appointed to succeed me. I am currently rushing to complete the handover procedures and plan to hand over on the of this month. The scale of Zhenzhong has been roughly established and the academic atmosphere is orderly. I believe that your succession will lead to further progress. However, the current urgent task is the management of school property. I have thought about it exhaustively. When will you arrive? Please telegraph me in advance. Xue Deyi."</p>

<p>New Measures for Enrollment of Private Universities in Shanghai Municipal Area</p>
<p>Approved by the Ministry of Education and Implemented by the Municipal Education Bureau</p>
<p>Since the new academic year is about to begin, the Shanghai Special Municipal Education Bureau is concerned that the qualifications of new students admitted by various private universities in the city will vary, which will make teaching difficult and make it difficult to improve the university level. Therefore, it has drafted six provisional measures for the enrollment of new students by private universities in the Shanghai Special Municipal Area and submitted them to the Ministry of Education for approval. After receiving the submission, the Ministry of Education believed that the measures drafted by the bureau were well-intentioned, made slight revisions to the original measures, and ordered the bureau to comply with them. The following is a summary of the provisional measures: (1) When private universities in the Shanghai Special Municipal Area enroll new students, the committee's established plan shall be reported to the Municipal Education Bureau and forwarded to the Ministry of Education in advance. (2) When private universities hold entrance examinations for new students, the examination methods and procedures shall be reported to the Municipal Education Bureau and forwarded to the Ministry of Education in advance. (3) When private universities hold entrance examinations for new students, the Ministry of Education or the Municipal Education Bureau may send personnel to investigate at any time. (4) If private universities exempt new students from all or part of the examination subjects, the reasons for the exemption shall be reported to the Municipal Education Bureau and forwarded to the Ministry of Education for approval in advance. If necessary, inspections may be carried out at any time. (5) The Municipal Education Bureau shall check the graduation certificates of the applicants when private universities hold entrance examinations. If the applicants have graduation certificates from unaccredited university preparatory courses and senior high schools, or have no certificates, they shall be ordered to stop the examination. (6) If private universities do not comply with the above measures, the Municipal Education Bureau may submit a request to the Ministry of Education to impose penalties in accordance with Article 6 of the Private School Regulations.</p>

<p>County Education Bureau Plans to Establish a</p>
<p>Mass Education Experiment Zone</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau is actively proceeding with the Mass Education Experiment Zone it is planning to establish. All the plans have been drafted and approved for implementation at a meeting. The plan is summarized as follows: (1) Name: The area is named the Shanghai County Mass Education Experiment Zone. (2) Purpose: The purpose of this zone is to experiment with socialized mass schools suitable for the conditions in this county and to implement the results of the experiments throughout the county. (3) Area: The mass education institutions run by the bureau, except for mass schools, are biased towards the west bank of the Huangpu River. For the sake of equal distribution of educational institutions, the zone should be located in Sanlin, Pudong. This matter has already been approved by the current Education Administrative Committee. However, if the entire Sanlin area is taken as the scope, the area is over 60 li in size, making it difficult to experiment with socialized mass schools. Therefore, one township in that autonomous region will be temporarily used as the area. Over the past month, the bureau has been in contact with the administrative authorities of the district several times, and it has been tentatively decided that Ruilong Township in the east of the district will be the area, and the Ruilong Temple in the township will be used as the temporary office. The east of the township is about one li away from Yangsi District in the special municipality, and six li away from Sanlin Town in the west. The transportation is convenient. The township has more than 100 households, and there is a trend of concentration. The residents are mostly engaged in agriculture, which is suitable for use as a mass education experiment zone. (4) Equipment: Since the purpose of this zone is to experiment with socialized mass schools suitable for the conditions in various parts of the county, if the selected area is not representative of the conditions in various parts of the county or is otherwise unsuitable as an experiment zone, it should be moved at any time. Therefore, all the equipment in the zone should be as simple as possible during the trial period, and it should be added after it is considered possible to continue the experiment. Moreover, during the preparation period, the forms of education needed by the masses are not yet known, and the living conditions of the masses are still unclear. If equipment is prematurely and presumptuously procured, it will be difficult to avoid the regret of cutting one's feet to fit the shoes. Therefore, the equipment in this zone must not be arbitrarily purchased during the trial period. At present, during the trial period, it is only necessary to rent three thatched houses and make some repairs to serve as the office for the staff of the zone and for trial use. As for the desks, chairs, and teaching aids needed by the mass school, they should also be purchased according to the urgency of the needs. (5) Staff: A. Staff Types: (1) Director-General (Concurrently held by the Director of the County Education Bureau or the Director of the Social Education Section, temporarily without pay. The zone's officer may be requested to serve as an agent at ordinary times.) (2) One officer for the Literacy Education Section, Investigation Section, and Readings Editing Section. (3) One officer for the Livelihood Education Section and Recreation Education Section. (4) One officer for the Political Education Section and Health Education Section. B. Staff Recruitment Standards: (1) General Standards: (1) High moral character, obedience to the Party. (2) Must have the spirit of researching and experimenting with mass education. (3) Must have a strong interest in rural life and the spirit of hard work and endurance. (4) Be kind and simple, able to approach the masses, and worthy of being a model for the masses. (2)</p>
<p>(1) The officer for the Literacy Education Section, Investigation Section, and Readings Editing Section must have in-depth research on education and considerable experience in reading material editing, social investigation, and editing. (2) The officer for the Livelihood Education and Recreation Education must have considerable experience and knowledge in agricultural science and experience in cooperative undertakings, and must have the skills to guide the masses in noble recreational methods. The officer for Political Education and Health Education must have considerable knowledge and experience in political education and health education. Clerical staff, accountants, and clerks will be concurrently held by the staff of each section and will not be hired separately for the time being. (6) Organization: Director-General of the Shanghai County Mass Education Experiment (1)) General Affairs Department: divided into three sections: document, affairs, and accounting. (2) Instruction Department: divided into seven sections: health, livelihood, household affairs, political, literacy, social interaction, and recreation education. (3) Research Department: divided into two sections: investigation and editing. (7) Phased Implementation: (1) Trial Period: Conduct social surveys, statistics, and planning and facility matters, and in accordance with the Mass Education Implementation Regulations promulgated by the Education Department, one mass school (i.e., classroom teaching) or one central tea garden may be tried first (tentatively for three months). (2) Implementation Period: Engage in research and experimentation on new theories and methods in mass education. (3) Implementation and Promotion Period: Continue to implement as in the previous period, but the results of the experiment must first be promoted in the entire Sanlin area, and then gradually promoted throughout the county. (8) Regulations of the Preparatory Committee: omitted.</p>
<p>Disturbance at Fudan Experimental Middle School</p>
<p>The issue of the director of Jiangwan Fudan Experimental Middle School has always been resolved by the general assembly of all faculty and staff of the school. At the end of this semester, the director of the school, Chen Wangdao, submitted his resignation. The general assembly decided to retain him and only allowed him to take leave, and elected three people for Chen Wangdao to designate one of them as an acting director. As a result, Li Baochen received the most votes with nineteen votes and was designated as the acting director. Afterwards,</p>
<p>many faculty and staff believed that it was a contempt for public opinion and a destruction of the spirit of the conference. Therefore, yesterday (July 6), they organized a school protection association and resolved on the spot to absolutely safeguard the resolutions of the faculty and staff conference, issued a declaration refusing to accept the illegal acting director's appointment letter, and many other important matters. They elected Kuai Shixun, Liu Zhixin, and Gui Yu Zhou as chairmen, and Di Xichen, Feng Lisan, Li Weinong, Jue Jiabin, Ma Shigang and others, nine people, to organize an executive committee to carry out all affairs.</p>
<p>Parent-Teacher Association at Chengdong Girls' School</p>

The most interesting ones included the "Little Painters" of the elementary school department and the "Moving Puppets" of the kindergarten, all of which were light-hearted and hilarious. There were five or six hundred spectators that day, which was quite a spectacle. The school will add a junior high school section next semester, and it is said that the number of applicants is already very large. The school's future development is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Global Day and Night School Graduation Ceremony</p>
<p>The Global China Students' Association Day School, Complete Elementary School, and Night School English Department at 95 Carter Road held a graduation ceremony and closing ceremony at 10 a.m. yesterday.

<h3 id="e85">Japanese Criticism of Our Country's Basketball Team Tactics <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Enemy Opinions, May Our Team Members Pay Attention (Lao)</p>
<p>Bearing Hardship with Patience for Four Years</p>
<p>The basketball team representing our country at this Far Eastern Games was composed of first-class players from both the North and the South, and was known as an ever-victorious army. Therefore, it was believed that the championship of the Games would be ours. Unexpectedly, the result was beyond expectations and created a new Far Eastern record of four defeats in four games. In addition to the pain and anger of the Chinese people, they have spared no effort to study the reasons for the failure in preparation for our team to avenge its shame in the 10th Games. The criticisms of Mr. Xu and Mr. Lu in this newspaper are unique and have made great contributions to the basketball community in our country. The Japanese have a lot of harsh criticisms of our team. Here are two of them that have not been mentioned by the two gentlemen, which are translated for the reference of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The Opinion of Li Xiangbai, Supervisor of the Basketball Team at Waseda University in Tokyo</p>
<p>The Chinese team's shooting, passing, and dribbling skills are all below those of the Japanese team, and their coordination is the least skilled and extremely chaotic. Their strong physique is their only advantage. In other words, they are just a team of talented players. The Chinese team's tactics are extremely clumsy and still in the simplest stage of basketball practice. Their most successful tactic is the vertical offense, that is, a forward goes to the middle and rushes into enemy territory to receive the pass from the rear and shoot. It is always the same and is very easy for the enemy to know and be watched by the enemy. There are no other strategies to replace it, which is why they were completely defeated.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Japanese team's guards, Ooba and Kobayashi, have genius skills in defending against this offensive method. Therefore, when the Chinese team used this tactic, except for Tang Baokun, who had one or two examples of success, or others who used their height to shoot under the basket or use long shots to gain cunning, they were almost unable to enter the Japanese basket. When the Japanese forwards retreated to take a defensive posture, it goes without saying that the Chinese team was exhausted and defeated.</p>
<p>The poor defense is not unique to the Chinese team. Japan and the Philippines are also like this. Relying on speed and talent, they pay attention to offense and do not care about defense. This is a chronic problem in China and the Philippines. When the five-man defensive method is not skillfully used, it can still be dealt with. Now, it is simply impossible not to be defeated. Comparing the strengths of the Japanese team's offense and defense, the defense is still incomplete, but it is still higher than the Chinese team. Therefore, the Chinese team will definitely be defeated. In short, the outcome of this Games depends entirely on the defensive strength of each team. This is often overlooked by people, but you must know that offense is the best defense. It is impossible to shoot if you always stand under the basket waiting for the ball. If you always think of the enemy coming to attack and pay attention to defense, you will have the opportunity to attack the enemy. It seems that none of the three teams paid much attention to this point.</p>
<p>The Chinese team cannot discuss the team's overall tactical plan or individual advances and retreats. In the eyes of outsiders, there are too many things that are inappropriate. I will not list them one by one. However, Mr. Tang Baokun's agile skills and Mr. Li Guochen's calm playing style are indeed rare talents. Individual skills in the Games should be the best of the two.</p>
<p>Criticism from the Games Referee, Mr. Higashijo</p>
<p>The Chinese team's offensive is exclusively using the straight attack method, and no one is active on both sides, which is the biggest weakness. Every time they attack, they send Mr. Tang straight into enemy territory without regard to the guards on both sides of the enemy. After the enemy's guards steal the ball, they retreat to the two sides and pass the ball to each other to advance. Although Mr. Tang runs back and forth, it is all in vain. Center Liu Jianchang and guard Li Guochen are fast and steady, and they are not flustered or hurried. They are truly outstanding in the army.</p>
<p>One of the most incomprehensible points in our tactics of the Chinese team is that in the second half of the second game between China and the Philippines, Mr. Tang Baokun and Mr. Chen Shengkui were on the court and their fighting power was very strong. They defeated the Soviet army with a score of 15 to 30 and could have taken advantage of the situation to continue scoring. However, coach Dong Shouyi suddenly replaced Chen Chengkui with Yao Enhan, and the Chinese team had no improvement. It can be said that the failure of the Chinese army this time was at the cost of this one substitution, which is not an excessive criticism.</p>
<p>The Chinese and Philippine teams were very embarrassed this time due to the Japanese refereeing. This is because the two teams lacked strict refereeing on weekdays. However, the Philippine army was still able to stabilize and fight back under unfavorable circumstances and win the final victory, while the Chinese team completely collapsed like a plate of loose sand. The individual spirit was confused and at a loss. This is nothing but a lack of experience. The only remedy is to play more games with stronger teams.</p>
<p>Words of Mr. Shiraro, the pioneer of the Japanese basketball community and sports director of the YMCA</p>
<p>The Chinese team has good performances in terms of individual skills, but it relies entirely on talent and lacks scientific training. Now basketball has become a science, and coaches must use scientific analysis methods. The most important first step is basic training, including (1) receiving or catching the ball, (2) passing the ball, (3) shooting, (4) step movements, and then gradually moving forward. This is undeniable. The Chinese team has the following obvious weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) After the team members shoot, the team members themselves or teammates do not follow up, so the unmade shots are obtained by the enemy. (1) Although the center's rebounding is good, the rebounding position is too fixed, and because the forwards are short, the rebounded balls are repeatedly searched by the enemy. Under this circumstance, the center cannot change the direction of the rebound.</p>
<p>(1) When serving the ball from the boundary, the formation is too chaotic and there is no fixed offensive method, so the receiver often has no one to pass to and misses the opportunity.</p>
<p>(1) More effort must be put into firm receiving and accurate passing. The long-distance passing method should be used less.</p>
<p>(1) When the enemy uses the five-man defense method, the Chinese team specializes in concentrating the attack in the middle and does not know how to attack the weak points on both sides of the enemy area. This is a disadvantage of the accustomed vertical line attack method. In the future, at least more practice should be done with the horizontal line attack method.</p>
<p>Editor's note: The above three gentlemen are all first-class authorities in the Japanese basketball community. The articles are published in the most valuable magazines in Japan. The three gentlemen also have very detailed criticisms of the Japanese and Philippine teams. I will translate them again after Japan.</p>

<p>Yesterday the weather was very hot, and the members were sweating like beads under the scorching sun, but they did not show any signs of fatigue. Their spirit is commendable. Here are a few of the more exciting games:</p>
<p>Hu Huaqin wins He Erkun: Mr. He's smashing power is sufficient, and his shots are as fast as falling stars, while Mr. Hu welcomes the shots from the front and back, and is able to save the situation with his wonderful and unexpected saves, which cannot help but make people shout in admiration. When encountering good materials, the fog of war becomes more intense. In the first game, Mr. He won two sets first, and Mr. Hu immediately returned the favor with two sets to maintain the balance. He continued to fight hard, and Mr. Hu won two sets first. Mr. He also caught up with two sets. The strength was equal and it was difficult to distinguish the winner. In the end, Mr. Hu advanced two more sets and took the lead. In the second game, Mr. He was eager to retaliate, and his smashes were too fierce, and the ball often flew out of bounds, which Mr. Hu took advantage of to make the score 6-1. However, the ball skills were also very impressive.</p>
<p>Yuan Shilong wins Mao Hongfa: Mr. Yuan is an old hand in this field, with both backhand shots and forehand hits, and is all-around in both offense and defense. Mr. Mao is a 17-year-old newcomer, and his combat is also very clever. Therefore, although he was defeated by Mr. Yuan with two sets of 6-1, the scores of each set were all 3-5, and the results were not weak. If he continues to improve day by day, he will definitely reach the top level.</p>
<p>Shen Yongnian wins Fu Shengxin: Both Shen and Fu are strong players in the Law Group. Mr. Shen's serving and returning posture are both good, and his strength is also thick. Mr. Fu's movements are light and the ball's landing position is close to the sideline, making it extremely difficult for the opponent to cope. The two were wonderful in their back and forth, and later Mr. Shen took the victory with his strong physical strength, with scores of 6-3 and 6-4.</p>

<p>The Decline in English and American Silver Prices Reverses Again</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and as usual, all domestic and foreign banks were closed, so there were no reports on financial or foreign exchange markets.

<p>A Weekly Summary of the Gold Market</p>
<p>Market Trend... The Ending Was Extremely Charming</p>
<p>Increase... A Sum of Twenty-Three Taels</p>
<p>Difference... Thirty-Eight Taels and Change</p>
<p>A Bird's-Eye View of the Entire Week: The past week coincided with the end of the banks' semi-annual closing of accounts, with two days of holidays. Therefore, the gold exchange was also closed. Thus, only four days of market conditions were observed. The attitude towards the gold standard turned from weak to strong, but the waves were very turbulent, and people felt quite confused. Prices fluctuated by three or four taels to ten taels. As the silver market continued to decline and foreign exchange rates went from increasing to decreasing, the internal rate was looser than the listed rate, so arbitrage gradually became more appealing. At the beginning of the week, the price of gold once fell to 571 taels, as there were rumors that silver bullion had been shipped for export, and the large bars and drafts had increased in value, which had an impact. Towards the end of the week, it suddenly surged again, breaking through the 600-tael mark, as foreign merchants and British and American tobacco companies settled their accounts, and it was rumored that cash was being transported to Tianjin.</p>
<p>As a result, people's confidence greatly increased, and there was a rapid upward trend, reaching 609.3 taels. There was a difference of 38 taels and change in these few days, but the industry was confused and disoriented. The closing price was just over 607 taels, which was an increase of 23 taels compared to the end of the previous week. The initial bid price was more than 70 taels, and later it was 55 or 56 taels. The events that occurred during these four days, from June 30 (Monday) to July 5 (Saturday), are described in detail below.</p>
<p>Detailed Account of the Process: Since the beginning of the week (end of June), both British and American silver prices have increased, and foreign exchange rates have also increased. However, the internal market has turned tense, which can be described as seemingly loose but actually tight. The initial opening price for the August gold standard was 581 taels. Then, a large dealer sold off, and as the exchange rate had already increased by one and a half tiers, it suddenly fell to 571 taels. Then, buyers prevailed, and the rumor of government settlement resurfaced, so it turned upward again. In the afternoon, it reached 91 or 92 taels, so it actually increased by six or seven taels. However, the wind and waves were turbulent, and the market held a double settlement price. There were a total of 21 taels of twists and turns throughout the day. The next day, July 1 and 2, there was no market because of the bank holidays. By Thursday (the 3rd), the silver market had declined for three consecutive days, and the exchange rate had also decreased by two tiers. The internal market was also tight, causing the price of gold to break out of the 600-tael mark. Furthermore, large dealers such as Fuchang, Yuancheng, and Yongzheng competed to buy in the morning, with the gross price reaching 606 taels. In the afternoon, as the major dealers sold off, the 600-tael mark was broken. In the afternoon, it returned to its peak, but the total increase for the day was just over 11 taels. The final price increased by 10 taels and 7 mace. The market on the following day (Friday) seemed to be stable, with fluctuations of only five or six taels, and the price seemed to be reversing. Then, the large bars suddenly increased in value, and the exchange rate and other internal factors weakened. As a result, it returned to 597.3 taels, a sharp drop of 4 taels and 6 mace. By Saturday (the 5th), the British silver was unchanged, and the American silver was not traded. The exchange rate did not move, and the internal market became tight again. Thus, the price of gold once again broke out of the 600-tael mark. However, the various firms had different inflows and outflows, and the price level was still good. However, there were 11 taels of twists and turns in half a day, and the exchange rate and other factors suggested that settlements were being made and that cash was being shipped to Tianjin. The market atmosphere suddenly became sharp, but the drafts were only slightly firm, not as sharp as the price of gold, and arbitrage was approaching. The opening price in the morning was the lowest, at 98.2 taels. At noon, it jumped by 10 taels, reaching 609.3 taels. The closing price was 607.5 taels, an increase of 10 taels and 2 mace compared to the previous day. The spot price was especially high and should have been increased by seven or eight taels, as the outflow seemed to be active. Compared to June 28 (the previous Saturday), it had increased by 23 taels, which was a significant change. The difference between the highest and lowest prices this week was 38 taels and 3 mace. The following table lists the high and low peaks for British and American silver markets and drafts:</p>
<p>Type  Highest Lowest  Compared to Last Saturday</p>
<p>Large Bar (Spot)  16 pence 15.5625 pence Decreased by 0.3125</p>
<p>Large Bar (Forward) 15.875 pence 15.4375 pence Decreased by 0.2</p>
<p>American Silver Price $0.34375 $0.335  Decreased by 0.0375</p>
<p>Bombay Price 46 rupees 0.03 45 rupees 0.10  Decreased by 0.03</p>
<p>British Exchange Rate 1 shilling 6.25 pence 1 shilling 5.75 pence Decreased by 0.125</p>
<p>American Exchange Rate 37 yuan 36 yuan  Decreased by 1.25</p>
<p>Japanese Exchange Rate 1 tael 3 mace 7.5 fen 1 tael 3 mace 4 fen Increased by 0.075</p>

<p>Weekly Review of the Bond Market Before and After the Account Settlement</p>
<p>Bond Prices Continue to Fall Sharply, Transactions Approach 40 Million</p>
<p>Due to the timing of the semi-annual account settlement, the bond market in Shanghai experienced significant price fluctuations, but the market appeared calm as major players remained on the sidelines. Except for Tuesday and Wednesday, when the market was closed for account settlement, futures trading amounted to over 12.4 million on Monday and over 11.1 million on Saturday. On Thursday and Friday, it was approximately 8 million each, totaling 39.52 million. Among them, Customs bonds, Reorganization bonds, and Disbandment bonds were the most active. Customs bonds for July totaled 6,665,000 yuan, and for August, 4,070,000 yuan. Reorganization bonds for July totaled 7,915,000 yuan, and for August, 3,965,000 yuan. Disbandment bonds for July totaled 7,600,500 yuan, and for August, 2,080,000 yuan. Rehabilitation bonds were also good, with 2,745,000 yuan for July and 1,490,000 yuan for August. Other bonds were quiet, such as the Sixth Year bonds, with 920,000 yuan for July and 980,000 yuan for August; Continued bonds, with 815,000 yuan for July and 20,000 yuan for August; Continued Second Five bonds, with only 500,000 yuan for July; Seventh Year bonds, with 100,000 yuan for July and 30,000 yuan for August; and the Ninety-Sixth Year bonds, with 90,000 yuan for July and 10,000 yuan for August. Financial bonds only opened with 20,000 yuan for July. Spot trading amounted to only 57,600 yuan, with Reorganization bonds accounting for 25,100 yuan and others only a few thousand yuan. In addition, the Nineteenth Year Customs bonds and Cigarette bonds have been opened for spot trading, but the circulation in the market is limited, and there will not be a large volume of transactions for the time being. The trend of bond prices is becoming increasingly tense due to the political situation. The market is feeling uneasy, and sellers are dominating. Although the price has fallen sharply, there are still many people taking the opportunity to buy in the market, but the supply and demand situation is still very different. Regarding the changes, except for Thursday, when the market sentiment stabilized slightly and the price rebounded, with Customs bonds, Reorganization bonds, Rehabilitation bonds, and other futures each rising by about 1.5 yuan, the rest continued to fall step by step, with a very consistent trend. On the last day of the weekend, the decline was particularly severe. The Disbandment bond futures were almost suspended due to excessive declines. As a result, compared to the previous week, Reorganization bond spot prices fell by more than 6 yuan, and Disbandment bond futures continued to fall by about 4.56 yuan. Customs and Reorganization bond futures also fell by more than 23 yuan. Except for the Ninety-Sixth Year bonds, which remained stable, other bonds also generally continued to fall. The current situation in the bond market is such that unless the political situation improves temporarily, bond prices will not easily return to firmness in the short term. The following is a statistical table of the high and low prices and rises and falls of bonds during the week (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>The Rice Market in Hexia is Calm and Relaxed</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, no goods were seen arriving. The registered white japonica rice in Hexia has mostly been purchased, and the remaining stock is less than 1,000 shi. The Price Evaluation Bureau continues to limit the price to 21 yuan. The number of shi purchased throughout the day is estimated to be several hundred. At the latest, it can be completed today, so after the settlement, it is necessary to see the source before proceeding. The indica rice here is also mainly Saigon small rice. The number of customers ordering and arriving at the port every day is two or three ships, and they are all sold to the retailers on this street. The price is the same as the Miscellaneous Grains Association. Although there are some factory-made goods such as Yangdujian, there is a lack of top-quality goods, so buyers are not greedy, and the market is calm and relaxed. The arrival of Bianyuan is scarce, and sales are sluggish. The price remains stable at 19.34 yuan for top-quality Bianyuan.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: The arrival of goods in Hexia is extremely scarce. The buying sentiment on this street is flat. The price of medium-quality japonica rice presents a sluggish situation because people are holding a wait-and-see attitude. The arrival and stock of Yangjian are both depleted, and the market is neither prosperous nor declining. The arrival of Baiyuan is very scarce, and the sales market is flat, with a tendency towards stagnation. The large wholesale price of Bianyuan is around 19 yuan, similar to the previous day.</p>

<p>The Silk Market Last Week Was on the Brink of Collapse</p>
<p>New York Silk Market Plunges to New Low Since the Start of the Great War</p>
<p>English and French Prices Open with Small Differences, Factory Cost 200 Taels</p>
<p>Last week, the Shanghai foreign firm silk market was the first week after the account settlement period for various foreign firms. In previous years, there was usually new transaction development at this time. This year, drastic changes have occurred in the Chinese and foreign silk markets, making it almost impossible to salvage the situation. The reason is that Chinese silk has always relied on American sales as its center, and the United States is currently the largest consumer of raw silk in the world. However, since the announcement and implementation of the new tariff bill, the economy has suddenly changed. In addition, silk fabrics are sluggish and inventories are piled up, so silk mills have had to reduce work, stop machines, and switch to using rayon to maintain the current situation. Silk prices have plunged, with a drop of two, three, to seven, eight dimes in US dollars per pound. Silk mills in England and France are also focusing on rayon in order to maintain workers' jobs, and there are only sporadic transactions in raw silk, and the opening prices are surprisingly small, with a difference of 200 taels from the cost of Shanghai factories. Chinese silk merchants are all concerned that the spring and summer cocoons have been poor, and the cost of silk is not cheap, and the loss is too great, making it difficult to sell. The silk market was almost stagnant last week. The low prices of overseas silk have set a new record since the start of the European War. The prospects for the silk market are increasingly pessimistic. Last week was the first week after the British and French postal ship companies increased the freight rates for Chinese silk. There are only 300 pieces of raw silk shipped to the United States. The following table lists the prices of Chinese silk in overseas markets last week (New York: price per pound in US dollars; Lyon: price per kilo in French francs):</p>

<p>A: Because the two of them are married, and Mr. C always goes to the small vegetable market every morning.</p>
<p>Man: Oh my!</p>
<p>Woman: Madam, long time no see, I've forgotten your name.</p>
<p>Woman: When we saw each other day and night, you had my name on your lips. No wonder you want to forget, but I've already married.</p>
<p>Husband: When you see Mr. Wang next door, you must be more serious. If I see you acting frivolous like today, I won't allow it.</p>
<p>Wife: I know, you've seen it today and yesterday, so I'll definitely change it up tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Advocating Barley Rice <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Hu Shuofu</p>
<p>Since the rice price problem occurred, many parties have been trying to find a solution, and especially those who advocate eating wheat are the most numerous. It is also said that northerners like wheat and are strong, while southerners like rice and are weak. Wheat prices are cheap, and rice prices are expensive, so it should be possible to implement reforms immediately. Unfortunately, flour is also expensive, so the so-called eating wheat should be to grind barley and naked barley to remove their skin and cook them with a little rice to make rice, or even without any rice at all. This is what the ancients called barley rice. Now, not being familiar with it, I will briefly describe the barley rice recorded in ancient books as follows, so that everyone knows that advocating eating barley rice is not a new invention:</p>
<p>Wu Yue Chunqiu: Wu Yuan arrived at the Jiang River, and a fisherman in the river ferried him across the Qianxun Ferry, holding barley rice, abalone soup, and a jar of wine, and singing and calling, "A person in the reeds, a person in the reeds, isn't he a poor scholar?"</p>
<p>Ji Jiu Pian: Pancakes, wheat rice, sweet bean soup</p>
<p>Hou Hanshu, Biography of Feng Yi: Wang Lang raised up, and Guangwu rushed southeast from Ji to Nangong. He encountered a great wind and rain. Guangwu led the chariot into a vacant house by the side of the road. Yi offered wheat rice and rabbit shoulder.</p>
<p>Hou Hanshu, Biography of Jing Dan: Marquis Yinyang, Yin Jiu, robbed and brought Dan. Having no choice, he set up a meal of barley rice and scallions.</p>
<p>Qi Shu, Biography of Liu Huaiwei: A civilian offered a dou of new rice. Huaiwei brought out the barley rice he was eating and showed it to him, saying, "I have more than enough to eat in the morning, so I don't need to bother with this."</p>
<p>Bei Shi, Wei Xiaowu Emperor Ji: The emperor whipped his horse and galloped to Hucheng. He was very hungry and thirsty. A villager from Sansi Village offered barley rice and a jug of wine. The emperor enjoyed it and rewarded the village for ten years.</p>
<p>Su Shi's poem: The west of the city suddenly reports the arrival of an old friend, so I quickly sweep the wind porch and cook barley rice.</p>
<p>Fang Yue's poem: The aroma of barley rice from the east family is strong, the west family sells silk and trades new grain.</p>
<p>Briefly listing historical events and poems by poets, it can be seen that eating barley rice has been around for a long time. Today, to solve the problem of expensive rice, eating barley rice is the most appropriate. It is hoped that someone will advocate it.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Random Talk about Wuhu <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Qian Qian</p>
<p>It has been ten days since I left Shanghai and arrived in Wuhu. I have carefully observed the customs and human sentiments of Wuhu, and I still don't see how closed-off it is. This is probably due to the convenience of transportation and the development of commerce. I have heard and seen a lot in these ten days, so I write it down randomly.</p>
<p>It can be said that Wuhu today is not impossible.</p>
<p>Silver Horns Are Not Current: Double mill silver coins are not very current here. Those who must exchange them at exchange shops must determine the price based on the silver coin. Generally, those from the eighth and eleventh years of the Republic of China are not current. Those from the ninth and tenth years can only be exchanged for 38 to 40 copper coins per coin. The silver coins I brought this time are still placed in a box, as I would rather leave them for use when I return to Shanghai. The current ones are all silver dollar bills and copper coins, with each silver dollar exchangeable for 320 copper coins.</p>
<p>Shops Have Two Prices: Most shops have a bargaining price. Those with marked prices, like Sincere and Wing On in Shanghai, are only four or five. Those who first arrive in Wuhu from Shanghai are greatly taken advantage of by the shops. The custom in shops is like this. Although it is clear that this is a weakness, the psychology of the buyer seems to require bargaining, so it is difficult to change it immediately.</p>
<p>It Is Difficult to Enjoy the Cool in Wuhu: Wuhu has a lake called Wuhu, but it is only a few miles around. There are also small boats in the middle that are enough to sail on. However, the lake is a dead water and does not connect to rivers. Recently, the water has turned green and has a strange odor. Small restaurants such as the First Spring, Yile Spring, and Second Western Restaurants on Zhongshan Road, as well as Yipin Xuan and Yipin Xiang Second Chinese Restaurants, all have water pavilions built, where people gather to drink in the evening, and the cool breeze is gentle. However, sometimes the wind and odor come together, and it is truly unbearable to approach.</p>
<p>Discussion of the National Goods Company: Recently, Mr. Hong Wenbin has newly joined forces to set up a National Goods Company to sell department store goods on a large scale, like the Sanyou Industrial Society in Shanghai. The roof item has a drink ice room, and the goods are sold at a fixed price and are all domestic goods, which shows patriotism and enthusiasm. The Wuhu Wanjiang Daily's attached column "Jungle Talk" has recently published many articles discussing the arrogance of the company's employees and the issue of the female employees' limelight, and Mr. Hong has also answered them one by one, which has attracted the attention of the general public. I think if there is indeed such a thing, it may be reformed. The newspaper industry should only fulfill its responsibility of guiding and correcting, and should not be too demanding. I think Mr. Hong will also agree with my opinion.</p>

<p>After leaving the United States, Mei Lanfang's troupe arrived in Honolulu on June 18 and performed for a week starting on the 23rd, with excellent results. It is reported that they boarded the Chichibu Maru at 5 pm on July 4 to return to China, and are expected to arrive in Yokohama on the 12th and in Shanghai on the 18th. The farewell to Honolulu was extremely grand, with many people sending off flowers.</p>

<p>Bi Ren</p>
<p>Sound films can be said to be popular today. However, I have never heard of them being shown in trains. It started with the Union Pacific train. When the train crossed the vast Colorado Desert, the small theater in the train showed sound films, allowing the dreary and boring passengers to enjoy the pleasure of viewing and listening.</p>
<p>This mobile cinema is attached to the Union Pacific train and is a trial run by Paramount Pictures, in conjunction with General Electric Production Research Company and Union Pacific Company.</p>
<p>The contents of the theater are all planned and configured by Paramount's professional technicians in Hollywood, and the decoration is very luxurious and beautiful. The seats are comfortable. All the machines that should be available for showing sound films are available. The first film to be shown is "The Virginian," starring Gary Cooper.</p>
<p>When the train with the cinema car arrives in New Mexico and Las Vegas, it separates from the original train and changes to another car to return to Los Angeles. Passengers can still enjoy the novel entertainment. I heard that the planning period lasted almost a year before such success was achieved.</p>

<p>(44) Spiritual Flower</p>
<p>On the 14th, I visited a Mr. Someone from the Overseas Chinese Middle School to discuss the New Villages in Nanyang. He had operated in the eastern provinces and failed due to the unrest. He had also seen my New Village Covenant. I told him that the New Village sites within the country were in the north in Suiyuan and Hetao. There were none in the south like Guangxi. Guangxi could establish a New Village for thousands of people. With thousands of people, land could be obtained from the government. It would be best to establish a New Village after the unrest subsided. He said his home was in Hunan, close to Guangxi. In the past, Liu Zihou's writings greatly praised the beauty of Hunan's mountains and rivers, saying they were rarely found anywhere else in the world. People who lived there would think they were immortals. I asked him about it, but he was a writer and likely embellished too much. However, Tao Yuanming's Record of the Peach Blossom Spring was also attributed to Wuling in Hunan and is still a mystery today. He said that New Villages in Nanyang could be found, and funds could be raised. The future looks promising.</p>
<p>On the 15th, I visited the botanical gardens. There were many plants in the garden that ordinary people could not name. Moreover, tropical plants are completely different from northern plants, and their properties are also different. The garden was established in 1874 and covers approximately 350 acres. The garden has a slightly elevated slope with a pond below, but Singapore has no mountains, only flat land everywhere, so there is not much difference in elevation. There is a Mango tree. This fruit is quite expensive in Shanghai, costing two dimes each. At first, its taste can be intoxicating. Tropical fruits often have a wine-like flavor, and I am not used to eating them. There is also a Durian tree. Durian is a very large and expensive fruit. It is covered with thorns. Each one costs four or five dimes or more here. It is not produced on this island but comes from the countryside. It is as big as a watermelon, so if one of these fruits fell from above in the garden, it could kill someone. The same is true for coconuts. Although they are not as big as durians, if one hit you on the head, it could break your skull. The durian is named Durian. When we first eat it, we can't stand its smell. But once you get used to it, you have to eat it, as if you were addicted. I then thought that everything in the world is a matter of habit. Perfume and stench are reversed. Only in food and drink is there no fixed taste. Zhuangzi said, "Deer eat reeds, people eat grain-fed meat, and dung beetles eat dung. Who knows the true taste?" This is like saltwater fish in the sea die in freshwater, and freshwater fish cannot survive in saltwater. There is an Asoka tree SorrowLesstree, which, like the Bodhi tree, is treasured in Buddhist countries. There are also Guanyin bamboo and bamboo forests. Although there are not many bamboo forests here, they are often seen. I saw very lush and beautiful bamboo forests in Guangxi. I heard that in Quanzhou, north of Guilin, there are hundreds of varieties in forests stretching for several miles. There is not much bamboo in Nanyang, but it would be good to plant more to create beautiful scenery. I wrote a poem on the aesthetics of bamboo in Guilin, which I am very proud of. The ancients compared bamboo to virtue. The clarity and beauty of bamboo is essential among plants. Nanyang, a hot place, should be planted with bamboo to dissipate the blazing heat.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Discussion of Electric Lights in Western Plays <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Qi Rushan</p>
<p>Before fully describing the use of electric lights in Western plays, I must solemnly declare that I am a layman in optics, and I have no in-depth research on the use of light in drama. I am only reporting what I have seen to my fellow comrades. Zhang Pengchun and Yu Jiu, two gentlemen, said that Mr. Zhao Taimou has done extensive research on this topic, but unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to learn from him. Twenty years ago, when I traveled in Europe, I paid close attention to the lighting methods used in theaters in various countries. However, at that time, the research in various countries was limited to describing the scenes of the sun and moon, day and night, water, fire, smoke, clouds, wind, rain, darkness and light, distance, strength, and weakness. There was no deep study of how light could move the audience. I have not been to Europe in the past ten years. I imagine there has been rapid progress. This year, when I came to the United States with Mr. Mei Lanfang, I saw that the lighting methods used in the theaters were different. Some used direct light, some used reflected light, some used dim light, and some used curved light. In some theaters, you could not see a single light, but there was still enough light. The audience was immersed in it as if sitting outdoors under the open sky. The color coordination could be described as ever-changing. When I entered the backstage organization, I saw that the research and equipment for lighting were given an important position. Many of the raw materials came from Germany, and there were also many machines invented in America. I heard that there was a newly invented machine that could change over ninety colors in one minute. The entire machine was worth over ten thousand US dollars. The research and evolution are truly advancing by leaps and bounds. One day, Mr. Bel Geddes, a master of optics and architecture, came to visit. He greatly admired Mr. Mei. We had a very pleasant conversation. I inquired about his lighting methods, so he invited me to see his work and enter his studio the next day. I saw it was full of optical architecture drawings. The equipment for the scenery and the effect of emotions were all changed by light. There were also two latest theater design blueprints, one for the architecture of the 1933 Chicago Art Exhibition and one built on the lake. There were seats and boxes, and the audience could row boats freely. The lighting equipment was different from that of ordinary theaters. One was built at the bottom of the lake. The entrance path was shallow and gradually deepened. The sides of the path were decorated with glass to prevent water from entering, and various colors of electric lights were arranged so that the audience felt like they were entering the bottom of the sea when they entered the theater. The various lights in the theater imitated the scenery of the seabed. The audience sat as if they were in a crystal palace. Although the use of light in theaters has reached its peak, it is still only used in the performance itself. Here, the lighting of the audience area is also being carefully researched. What I have discussed above is still using light as an aid to the performance. Recently, Mr. Wilford, a master of optics, invented a machine specifically to move people's psychology with light. One day, he invited Mei Lanfang, Zhang Pengchun, and me to see his machine. When I entered his room, I saw many machines and various designs were displayed everywhere. The newest machine had six light heads. The machine was like a square disk, five or six feet in length and width. Small mechanisms were arranged like a star chart on the disk surface, all with very precise scales. By pushing and pressing with both hands, the light projected from the lamps onto the screen changed endlessly. First, he tried with triangular light, then he tried with light similar to landscape, and the light had a meaning. In short, it was sometimes like still water at the bottom of a well, sometimes like boiling soup in a cauldron, sometimes like a pile of brocade, sometimes like a group of beauties playing in the waves, sometimes like drizzle, sometimes like a gentle breeze, sometimes like endless falling leaves, sometimes like the endless Yangtze River, sometimes like an old monk in meditation, sometimes like an angry lion roaring, sometimes white waves surging, sometimes auspicious clouds gathering, sometimes thunder and lightning, sometimes the wind stops and the clouds clear, sometimes like ten thousand miles of plains, sometimes like a thousand-foot cliff, sometimes like clouds and horses flying in the sky, sometimes like a group of swans playing in the sea, sometimes like deep mountains and great swamps, sometimes like a secluded spring in an empty valley, sometimes the earth shakes and the mountains sway, sometimes the wind is calm and the waves are still, sometimes like being in the clouds, sometimes like being hidden at the bottom of the sea, sometimes the mind is relaxed and happy, and sometimes it is thrilling. The light on the screen changed repeatedly, and the audience's mind also changed with it. It was truly a spectacle of optics. According to Mr. Wilford, the research is not yet precise, and the psychology of ordinary people has not yet been moved, so he dares not put it on the market. After further research, he will undoubtedly achieve his goal. The perseverance of Western scholars in scientific research is admirable. Outside the room, there were also several small machines that could be carried around, which could also change several kinds of light, but not as many changes as the large machine. When asked how much they cost, he replied that they were not yet complete, so they were not for sale at the moment. In the future, each machine would cost about two or three thousand gold. The research of light has reached a point where it is completely separate from the drama. The more various sciences are researched, the more specialization is needed. This is inevitable. Overall, the research on electric light can be described as leaving no stone unturned. The viewers also felt relaxed and happy. It is an important invention. Unfortunately, Chinese opera cannot use it at the moment. When Mr. Mei was in New York, there were two great directors, Mr. Earl Corrv. They also had extensive research on light. Before Mr. Mei performed, he said that drama must be equipped with electric light here. I will help especially. I have a good relationship with each theater, and if I suggest it, the theater will be happy to do so. He was very sincere and touching. He was immediately asked to take care of the arrangement of the theater. Mr. Kuo first went to each play site to carefully study the distribution of electric lights. The ten kinds of light changes pointed out by his fingers resulted in using white light from beginning to end without changing. Because Chinese dramas are symbolic. Whether day or night, darkness or light, are all expressed through movements and expressions. If supplemented by light, it will not only be useless but also harm the plot. Take various objects, such as door curtains, hall curtains, table skirts, chairs, costumes, decorations, etc., they are all in very dark colors. No matter what kind of electric light is projected onto them, it will lose its effect. Therefore, the current Western set designs are mostly lightly sketched, relying entirely on light to change the color. As for dance, acrobatics, etc., most of the scenes are monochrome curtains, and the costumes are only one or two kinds of very light colors. At that time, electric light is used to transform and change many colors, which is very beautiful. If you use heavy colors of dark red and green, electric light will be useless. This is also the current situation of the use of electric light in Western plays. Therefore, if Chinese dramas also adopt electric light in the future, there must be a completely different type of organization method to be able to control it.</p>

<h3 id="e100">City Government Allocates 1,000 Yuan for Locust Control <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau believes that locusts have been causing disasters and damaging crops recently. According to the investigation report of the Insect Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces, the loss in Jiangsu Province in the 18th year of the Republic was 10 million yuan. The loss in Zhejiang Province was 10 million yuan in the 17th year and nearly 40 million yuan in the 18th year. The total loss in Jiangxi Province in the 17th and 18th years was 19 million yuan. Although this city has not conducted a detailed investigation, according to the report of the Zhenru Agricultural Experiment Field of the Chinese Agricultural Society, the yield per mu in the 17th year must be reduced by 25%. If the area occupied by rice in the urban area accounts for two-tenths of the total area, which is about 140,000 mu, and the average yield is reduced by 80 catties per mu, the loss due to locusts should be more than 700,000 yuan. The degree of locust damage in the 18th year was increased by 50% compared with the 17th year, and the estimated loss was more than 1 million yuan. The harm of locusts is evident. The bureau approved the city government's allocation of funds for locust control last year and compiled and printed various locust control illustrations and slogans, purchased specimen equipment and sent personnel to various districts to carry out propaganda, and selected the more severely affected districts to conduct a pilot locust control cooperation experiment area. The entire process of handling the matter has been reported to the city government for filing. It is now approved by the Baoshan County Government to forward the letter from the Secretariat of the Agricultural College of the National Labor University, stating that locust eggs were found in the four agricultural areas. They are transferring the search and capture of locust moths and burning locust eggs in order to prevent rice disasters and save farmers. The bureau sent personnel to various districts with various propaganda materials to conduct extensive persuasion. At the same time, the Labor University Agricultural College was requested to assign experts to assist. According to the report of the returning personnel, when they went to various districts to conduct propaganda, very few farmers came to listen to the lectures. If the goal of eliminating locust damage and enriching people's welfare is to be achieved, it is feared that there will be no hope if another way is not sought. The bureau reported to the city government for review. The extermination of locusts is the only good way to save people's food. If farmers are not urged to work hard to eliminate the hidden dangers, it is unbearable to imagine. In order to fundamentally save agriculture the bureau intends to purchase locust moths and locust eggs in various districts of the city in order to extinguish and save the people. It specially requests the city government to approve the allocation of 1,000 yuan for locust control in accordance with the case. It is proposed to cooperate with the Labor University Academy to purchase extensively in Wusong Jiangwan and other districts first. The temporarily determined purchase price is one copper coin for each locust egg block and two copper coins for each two locust moths. It is heard that the city government, after receiving the report, specifically ordered the approval of the matter relating to the prevention of rice disasters and at the same time, ordered the Finance Bureau to allocate 1,000 yuan for expenses.</p>

<p>The book collection of the Qu family's Tieqin Bronze Sword Building in Changshu is known as one of the four major book collectors along with the Yang family's Haiyuan Pavilion, the Lu family's Song Tower, and the Ding family's Rare Book Room. Later, the Lu books went to the Iwasaki Library in Japan, and the Ding books went to the Nanjing Library. Although the Yang books were recently banned from being transported out by the Shandong Provincial Government, they have been inevitably scattered. Only Qu Diyiye's collection has not been scattered. The entire collection has been stored in Yu County. After the Qi Lu War in the year of Ji Chou, fearing that they would suffer from war again, he specifically moved them to a refined residence in Shanghai. Yesterday, the owner, Qu Liangshi, specially invited literary figures Cai Yuanpei, Hu Shi, Dong Zuobin, Zhang Yuanji, and others to visit. All the Song and Yuan editions listed in the original catalog were present, and they were all surprised by the far-reaching nature of the collection. Rumors in the outside world saying that he was trying to sell them to foreign countries for profit are completely unfounded.</p>
<h3 id="e103">The Second Day of the Joint Movement Propaganda Week <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Academic Lectures in the Morning, Recreational Activities in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Recreational Gathering Will Continue at the Youth League Tonight</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Cooperative Movement Propaganda Week in the city. The organizing committee sent letters to various sectors beforehand to notify them that an academic lecture on cooperation would be held at Daxia University on Jiaozhou Road, Shanghai, at 9:00 am, and a recreational gathering would be held at the City Chamber of Commerce on Tianhou Palace Bridge in the afternoon. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>The academic lecture was held in the auditorium of Daxia University in the morning. The organizing committee invited cooperation experts Hou Houpei and others to give lectures. More than 200 people attended the meeting. First, Chairman Xu Xingchu gave a report, stating briefly that today is the second day of the Cooperative Movement Propaganda Week in the city. Holding an academic lecture here makes the urgency of the cooperative movement needed in our country is known to all. However, in order to promote the cooperative business effectively, we must first know and then act, otherwise, it will fail. Since the beginning of the cooperative movement in various countries around the world, there have been many cases of failure due to this mistake. The organizing committee, in view of Ster, invited cooperation experts to give lectures so that the city's cooperative business can be promoted without hindrance. Then, Hou Houpei gave a lecture on the needs of the cooperative movement in China, elaborating in detail and thoroughly discussing it. Finally, Mr. Wang, who had just returned from Japan, gave a lecture. Mr. Wang worked at the Japan Industrial Union Central Association. He has extensive theoretical and practical experience in the cooperative business. After the lecture, he discussed the difficulties of the cooperative society with the audience. Finally, the association distributed various cooperative books and dispersed.</p>
<p>The recreational gathering was held at the City Chamber of Commerce at 7:00 pm last night. It was hosted by the organizing committee and the three district party headquarters. More than 1,000 people attended the meeting. First, Chairman Chen Dezheng gave a report, stating briefly that when the national economic situation is so dire, and all the rebellions, warlords, bandits, and communists are so rampant, the people's lives are extremely difficult. This year, with the rise of the gold and silver trend, the people have fallen into dire straits. At a time when the country and the nation have suffered several major blows, in addition to working hard to eliminate all the warlords, bandits, and communists who endanger the party and the country, we should also actively seek a remedy for the people's livelihood problems. The central government has issued an order to all provinces and cities across the country to hold a cooperative movement propaganda week. The significance of this is to save China's dying people's livelihood. The city's cooperative movement propaganda week is jointly prepared by party and government agencies. Holding a recreational gathering here today is to promote the theory and methods of organizing cooperative societies in the minds of the general public in order to achieve great progress in the city's cooperative business after the end of the party's propaganda week.

<h3 id="e107">Yu Tang Funding <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Requesting Additional Tax on Fields</p>
<p>Yang Fulin, Chairman of the Yu Tang Dredging Preparatory Committee, presented a document to the Shanghai County Government and the Construction Bureau yesterday, stating that it was a report on the decision to dredge the Yu Tang and carry out additional tax on the fields, requesting review and forwarding. The dredging of the Yu Tang was organized on September 10 of the 18th year by the district chiefs of the second, third, and sixth districts and the director of the Construction Bureau to organize a preparatory committee to discuss the dredging methods. The charter of the preparatory committee and the list of members have been reported for filing. However, the river is the main river in the east and west of the county, receiving the Xiepu River in the east and reaching the Yueerjing in the Songjiang boundary to reach the Mao River, which is more than 4,700 feet long. In particular, the East Huangpu River receives the incoming tide and turbid outflow, and sediment is easily deposited, which is becoming increasingly blocked. The dredging project this time is huge, and the funding is even greater. Therefore, the fourth and fifth preparatory committee meetings decided to implement the project, referring to the Xiecheng case of the dredging of the Yu Tang in the Tongzhi period, reducing the amount of Xie dredging by half, issuing the river rice to the owners, and halving the Xie dredging according to the large dredging example of five liters per mu. The dredging funds, excluding the survey fee borne by the Construction Bureau, are fixed at 10,000 yuan, estimated as follows: (1) Bridge repair fee of 3,000 yuan (2) Fill fee of 2,500 yuan (3) Water fee of 2,000 yuan (4) Level pile fee of 500 yuan (5) Office fee of 1,000 yuan (6) Reserve fee of 1,000 yuan is generally collected from the fields and taxes. The association separately submits it to the county bureau and forwards it to the financial and construction departments for review, etc. With the approval of this, it should be copied and submitted to the above-mentioned resolution for review and approval to forward and approve the additional tax on the fields in order to seek water conservancy and benefit the people, which is convenient for the public.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Ministry of Industry and Commerce Explains the Labor Dispute Resolution Law <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial Press trade unions requested a general wage increase, resulting in a labor dispute. The Shanghai Municipal Government's arbitration was ineffective and difficult to handle. The Shanghai Municipal Government's detailed rules for the implementation of the Labor Dispute Resolution Law and the separate regulations and interpretations on the meaning and scope of employment conditions of worker groups, as well as how to remedy the special circumstances where arbitration committee members refuse to attend and cannot arbitrate, have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and approval, which was consulted by the Judicial Yuan and ordered the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to reply. It is learned that the department has submitted the meaning interpretation for review, stating briefly that the issue of whether the absence of members of the Labor Arbitration Committee can open the arbitration has been presented by the Shanghai Municipal Government to the Executive Yuan, instructing the Judicial Yuan to interpret that if the members of the arbitration committee are unable to perform their duties, a separate meeting should be held depending on which item of Article 13 the member represents. The same shall be followed and replaced. However, if the special circumstances mentioned in the original application are not remedied, not only will the parties to the dispute suffer, but the original intention of the legislation will be lost. It is believed that since the representatives of the fourth item of Article 13 of the Labor Dispute Resolution Law have been recommended by the worker groups and employer groups, they must have considerable qualifications in the worker groups or employer groups, and the task of the arbitration committee is to be fair and seek the interests of both labor and management, which is the responsibility that should be fulfilled after being recommended and approved. Therefore, if an arbitration committee member cannot perform their duties due to some reason before the meeting, they should state the reasons and be permitted by the original convening agency to appoint a representative with the same qualifications to fill the vacancy. If they do not declare an obstacle and do not attend, it will be deemed that the representative has voluntarily given up, and the original convening agency will report it to the government to remove their qualifications as an arbitration committee member from the list of arbitration committee members and report it to the department for filing as a reputational punishment so that they can be warned and maintain the law. Although there is no clear provision in the labor dispute law for this method, it can be clearly stipulated in the implementation rules prepared by each province and city to remedy it.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Representatives Go to Beijing to Petition <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Restore the Boundaries of Traditional Business Sectors</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Trade Association, the Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Workers' Union, and the Shanghai Cotton and Cloth Dyeing Workers' Union, representing both labor and management, have been jointly discussing the disruption of their business by outsiders and the resulting threat to labor and management. They have resolved to send representatives, including Zhu Boying, to Beijing with a petition last night by train to appeal to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government's Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. They request the implementation of relief measures. The petition reads as follows:</p>
<p>A Petition for the Implementation of Relief Measures to Address Business Disruption and Harm to Labor and Management, in order to Maintain Industry and Commerce and Benefit the People.</p>
<p>It is respectfully stated that Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce, and our dyeing industry is one of the material cultures related to silk and cotton weaving. It has a considerable history in the industrial sector, and its prosperity or decline is crucial to the national industrial economy and the people's livelihood. In recent years, with the eastward spread of Westernization, various imperialist powers have been using every means to carry out economic aggression, which has had a particularly significant impact on our dyeing industry. Furthermore, due to the lack of unity among businesses and the abandonment of industry regulations, dyeing prices have been excessively reduced, and the cost of dyes has suddenly increased, eroding capital. The inherent business is on the verge of decline, factories are closing one after another, unemployment among workers is increasing daily, and social security is precarious.</p>
<p>In view of this, the associations, in the spirit of labor-management cooperation, jointly organized the "Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Labor-Management Joint Price Regulation Committee" in the winter. At the cost of material and spiritual sacrifices, they actively reorganized, unified dyeing prices, restored industry regulations, and properly arranged for unemployed workers. Past achievements have been fairly good, and the pitfalls of disputes in the second-hand clothing and pharmaceutical industries in Shanghai can be avoided. The recovery of business is just around the corner. However, recently, a group of red dye shops specializing in dyeing red, foreign yuan dye shops specializing in dyeing black, pre-refining shops specializing in primary refining, paddle shaft shops specializing in paddle shafts, and silk and satin stores that were not originally in the dyeing industry have taken the opportunity to carry out aggression, disrupting boundaries. They have openly accepted the dyeing of silk fabrics that were originally dyed by our silk and satin dyeing industry, reducing dyeing prices, cutting alcohol costs, and engaging in various disruptive and chaotic behaviors. If no measures are taken to stop and correct this, silk and satin dyeing factories will inevitably go bankrupt, and thousands of workers will become unemployed. What will become of our industry's future?</p>
<p>Although there are no explicit legal provisions regarding the scope of business in our commercial sector, established customs should not be abolished. Moreover, the Civil Code states, "Where there is no provision in the law, customs may be followed." The associations have repeatedly considered and negotiated, but to no avail. Although we have recently appealed to the local authorities in this city for relief, we fear that it may not be resolved in a timely manner. In order to protect the business and to liberate thousands of unemployed workers, in addition to separately submitting petitions to various agencies in this city for immediate and effective relief, we have dispatched representatives, including Zhu Boying, to present a written petition. We humbly request that you grant us an audience and promptly conduct comprehensive planning to implement relief measures. We also request that you instruct the responsible authorities in Shanghai to strictly prohibit and effectively correct the situation, restoring the boundaries of traditional business sectors in the shortest possible time, in order to protect industry and commerce and benefit the people. We await your instructions with utmost urgency.</p>

It is now learned that there is hope for a satisfactory resolution, and all workers are scheduled to resume work this morning (the 7th) at 8:00 AM. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mediators Shuttle Back and Forth: After the news of the resumption of work encountered obstacles, the mediators, considering the complexity of the situation, were initially reluctant to intervene further. However, due to persistent requests from all parties, they dispatched representatives to shuttle back and forth, ultimately securing hope for a satisfactory resolution and a resumption of work at 8:00 AM today.</p>
<p>All Detained Workers Released: In addition to Zhou A'liu and Liu Linsheng, who have already been released, Song Youxing remains detained because he was transferred to the court by the Public Security Bureau and could not be released immediately. It is now learned that the mediators have taken responsibility for Song's release, and he is expected to regain his freedom today. Zhou A'long and two other workers, who were detained by the French police on the afternoon of the previous day, were also bailed out by the mediators at 3:00 PM yesterday and sent to the labor union.</p>
<p>Resumption of Work Plan Approved: At 3:00 PM yesterday, the workers convened a meeting of representatives to discuss the resumption of work plan, which included the following points: (1) The factory's agreement to the three conditions should be signed and implemented by the mediators in conjunction with the city party headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau. (2) Song Youxing should be released by tonight (the 7th). (3) The factory should completely remove the new workers and White Russians. (4) If disruptive elements continue to act as they did the day before, the French police should detain them. (5) The factory should open the gates when the workers resume work. It is reported that if the above plan cannot be achieved, the union will continue the strike. It is also reported that the strike committee and picket team organized by the union will not be disbanded for the time being and will only be dissolved after all the conditions have been met and work has officially resumed.</p>

Fortunately, the cars did not derail. The stationmaster telegraphed the engineering department to dispatch track workers and mechanics to repair the damage. The freight train was backed up to the original track to await repairs. After about five hours, the repairs were completed and traffic was restored, causing the freight train to arrive at the Shanghai station behind schedule.</p>
<p>On the night before last, freight train No. 27 from Zhapu to Shanghai was held up at Xieshi around 8:50 PM because workers from the road engineering department were repairing a bridge. The train was detained at the station until 4:40 PM the next day, arriving at the Shanghai station ten hours behind schedule.</p>

<p>Defense Corps to Conclude Operations Immediately</p>
<p>Awaiting Reorganization</p>
<p>The team leaders of the Southern District of Shanghai Defense Corps received Instruction No. 124 from the Corps headquarters, "Order to Cease Operations and Await Reorganization, and Report the Completed Situation Within a Deadline." Team Leader Feng Runsheng of Team 3 considered the matter to be of great importance and notified all executive committee members, who convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. It was resolved to comply with the order, cease operations immediately, await reorganization, and all committee members expressed their intention to resign. The original order is attached below:</p>
<p>Regarding Compliance: Instruction No. 90 from the Shanghai South District Office states, "In response to Instruction No. 250 from the Reorganization Committee, it is stated: 'Regarding the Instruction, it is paramount for all organizations to prioritize organization. The nature of the Defense Corps is similar to that of the military police, and its organization is particularly important. In the past, the Corps in various districts were established at different times and operated independently. There were no unified methods for funding and organization, and the content was disorganized and unclear. The number of people in the same team varied greatly, and the teams in the same Corps differed significantly. There were no standards for the number of teams to be established in each Corps or the number of people in each team, which had a significant impact on Corps affairs. Since this Committee was ordered to reorganize, the various points that needed to be rectified have been carried out in order, and the funding for the Corps in various districts has also been comprehensively planned and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. In response to the organization level, repeated inquiries and deliberations have been made, and it has been decided that 108 people should be organized into one team, with each team having three squads and each squad having three shifts. The number of teams to be established in each district Corps should be based on the current number of Corps members and determined separately in consideration of local conditions, as resolved at the eleventh standing meeting. After this determination, the Corps in each district should immediately comply with the reorganization, and the number of personnel in each team must meet the prescribed quota and may not be deficient or excessive. Those who are currently insufficient should immediately recruit enough personnel, and those who have surplus personnel should be reassigned to the reserves. The allocation and combination of the Corps in each district and the distribution of defensive positions should still be considered and handled by the Corps chiefs based on local conditions. In addition to sending instructions, it is ordered that the chief immediately instruct the affiliated Corps in each district to comply uniformly and report the compliance situation within ten days from the date of this document so that personnel can be dispatched to verify the situation without any delay. This is extremely important.' In addition to issuing copies to various places, it is ordered that you immediately comply with the instructions and complete the handling of each item within ten days from the date of this document and report the compliance situation so that it can be forwarded for review without any delay. This is extremely important.' In response to this, it is ordered that each team should immediately cease operations and await reorganization, and that the team leader should immediately handle the conclusion and report it within three days from the date of this document to await transfer. This is extremely important."</p>

Although there have been occasional disputes from those who do not understand the situation, the staff has explained things to them and resolved the disputes. The union has also announced that members must not be blinded by greed and sell reactionary tabloids. If they do, their new bags will be confiscated and they will not be allowed to operate.

<p>The Shanghai Mercerized Cotton Weaving Trade Association was officially established on April 26th of this year and has been approved by the Municipal Civil Training Committee and registered with the Social Affairs Bureau. Subsequently, representatives from the cloth factory industry, including Shen Yaoqing and fifty others, jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Civil Training Committee requesting permission to establish a trade association. After receiving the petition, the Civil Training Committee dispatched personnel to inspect and review the matter. They determined that the business operated by the petitioners is similar to the business of the Mercerized Cotton Weaving Trade Association and should join the association in accordance with Article 5 of the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law, which stipulates that only one trade association may be established for the same industry in the same area. It is learned that the petitioners have been instructed to comply and that the Mercerized Cotton Weaving Trade Association has been instructed to accept their membership and work together for the benefit of the industry.</p>

<p>Plumbing contractors, electrical supply stores, and electrical installers in the city are registering with the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, which issues licenses allowing them to operate. According to the Regulations for Registering Plumbing Contractors, plumbing contractor licenses are valid for one year and must be renewed upon expiration, with a renewal fee of two yuan. Those who continue to operate in the city with an expired license for more than fifteen days will be penalized if discovered. The Regulations for Managing Electrical Supply Stores and Electrical Installers also stipulate that electrical supply store or electrical installer licenses must be renewed annually. The bureau, recognizing that licensees often do not remember the expiration date and that there are too many to notify individually, has submitted a request to the Municipal Government to change the system so that plumbing contractor, electrical supply store, and electrical installer licenses must be renewed annually from July 1st to July 15th. Those whose licenses have been valid for less than six months will have their licenses renewed free of charge, while those whose licenses have been valid for more than six months but less than one year will pay half the fee. The new system will be implemented starting today.</p>

<p>An Egg with a Small Hole</p>
<p>A Black Tail in the Hole</p>
<p>Can Move at Any Time</p>
<p>The Lei Ting Teahouse inside the West Gate of Baoshan is opened by the wife of the Mai family, Wang Lu. Mrs. Wang raises three hens. At 6:00 PM on the 5th of this month, the smallest hen laid a strange egg that was no different from ordinary eggs, except that the upper end of the egg had a dark shadow the size of a cash coin with a hole in the middle. A black tail, about an inch long and shaped like a rat's tail, protruded from the hole and could move on its own. This caused a sensation in the neighborhood, and onlookers flocked to see it. The incident was reported to the County Public Security Bureau, which ordered the patrol leader to borrow the egg from Mrs. Wang and place it in the City God Temple (i.e., the People's Assembly Hall) for the public to view. What is inside the egg will be reported after the eggshell is broken.</p>

<p>Needle Injectors Themselves Do Not Have This Addiction</p>

<p>Shao Changsheng Sentenced to Two Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>Seventeen People Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment Each</p>
<p>Shanghai is an area where red and black poisons gather. The red one is the smoke cessation pill on the gun, commonly known as the "red bead," which is more than ten times more poisonous than black opium. It was not initially noticed by the world, and a large number of people from the mainland came to sell it. This is because the wholesale price in Shanghai is only seven or eight yuan per thousand, while it can be sold for eighteen or nineteen yuan or even more than twenty yuan in the mainland. Because of the profit, everyone is vying for it. Recently, military and police agencies have begun to strictly investigate and ban it at railway and wharf terminals, and there have been seizures from time to time. However, many Shanghai people with opium habits have changed to red pills because they are slightly cheaper than opium and the procedure is simple. However, ordinary coolies find that injecting morphine is even faster than red pills. According to insiders, a morphine injection worth one corner is enough to抵抵抵抵the effect of smoking opium worth three corners. Therefore, these people have abandoned opium and even red pills and only pursue injections. As a result, some people cater to the psychology of these people and set up a place for injections, specializing in passing golden needles to people all day long. The day before yesterday morning, Huishan Patrol Room Chinese detective Shi Baoying arrested seventeen coolies who were seeking morphine injections in a house at No. 29 Hua Ji Road. Observing their limbs, red and black spots were all over their skin, and there were many injection marks, shaped like honeycombs. From this, it can be seen that these seventeen people have been injecting not just for a day or two. Shao Changsheng, a native of Jiangbei who administered the injections, alone did not have this addiction. Considering the principle of "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself," Shao is indeed guilty and cannot escape punishment. Subsequently, the patrol room sent them all to the Special District Local Court. Judge Ge Zhiqin interrogated them. Judge Ge sighed when he saw that they were emaciated and covered with scars. He warned them to quit as soon as possible, otherwise their death was not far off. Later, Shao Changsheng was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and fined four hundred yuan for engaging in this illegal act, and the other seventeen were each sentenced to six months of imprisonment, so that doctors could help them quit in prison. The morphine and injection equipment involved in the case were all confiscated.</p>

<p>Avoiding Mosquitoes Leads to Disaster</p>
<p>Yang Yongyu Dies Strangely</p>
<p>Yang Yongyu, a 48-year-old machine worker from Zhenjiang, lived at No. 8, Tongkang Lane, Gaochang Temple, South Shanghai. Because the weather has been hot recently, and Gaochang Temple is a low-lying and humid area, mosquitoes buzzed and it was difficult to sleep at night. Yang and his wife, Yang Ma, were troubled by this. Therefore, after dinner the day before yesterday, Yang Ma discussed with her husband that it would be better to sleep elsewhere to avoid mosquitoes. So Yang Ma first went to her sister's house at No. 5 Zaopi Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, to stay overnight, and made an appointment for Yang to go as well. Because Yang had other matters, he told his wife to go first and he would come later. After Yang Ma arrived at her sister's house, she asked to stay for a few nights, and her sister agreed. However, Yang Ma waited for her husband for a long time and had nothing to do to pass the long night. Her sister had two gambling tickets for the amusement park, so she went to play with her. When she returned home at midnight, Yang Yongyu was already lying on the bed, unconscious. When she pushed him, his body was stiff and his breath had stopped early on. She was greatly shocked and cried loudly. The police arrived and asked about the cause, and took Yang Ma to the 5th District Police Station. There were no clues, but the death of the deceased was strange and there were suspicious circumstances. Therefore, yesterday, Ge Yitu, the local保甲, was ordered to report to the local court for examination.</p>

<p>To Build Autopsy and Tai Hospital</p>
<p>Since the Judicial Administration Department established the Forensic Preparation Office in the Special District Local Court, its most important work has been to prepare for the construction of an examination institute and the establishment of a hospital. In the past, autopsy examinations in the Public Concession were all conducted at the Autopsy Examination Institute on Fielun Road, and the examination was undertaken by the 工部局 Hospital next to the institute. Both places were under the jurisdiction of the 工部局. Now that our country has recovered the legal rights of the concession, the important task of examination should no longer be entrusted to foreigners. Therefore, the Forensic Preparation Office decided to build its own autopsy examination institute and hospital. It is said that the location has been surveyed along the Zhenru Town Railway and 民地 has been requisitioned. The drawings of the autopsy examination institute and hospital have been submitted to the Ministry of Justice for approval, and construction will begin immediately. The preparation office is now inviting contractors to bid, requiring completion within six months from the date of winning the bid.</p>

<p>Forced to Relocate and File a Lawsuit</p>
<p>The Old Lu Gao Jian Meat Shop at No. 312-4, Pintang Lane, Nanjing Road, has been open for more than ten years. The landlord is Zhang Hengshan, who has always been leased by the Gao Yi Mansion. On the 26th of last month, he suddenly received a notice from the agent,限 him to move out of the house the next day. The shop thought that the owner's forced relocation for no reason was wrong, and that the time limit was only one day, which was even more absurd. Moreover, the custom in Shanghai is that the landlord must give the tenant a month's notice of eviction. Now the landlord is forcing people too much, which is difficult to accept. He immediately hired lawyer E Sen to request the Special District Local Court to issue an edict prohibiting the landlord from forcing the relocation. However, the prohibition edict had not been issued by the 27th, and the landlord then ordered masons to remove the tiles from the shop, making it impossible to operate in the open air. The shop had to move. At the same time, it asked lawyer E to file a lawsuit against Zhang Hengshan for damages. It is said that the case will soon be summoned by the Special District Court for both parties to appear in court for trial.</p>

Huang Changji Pig Farm in the area paid for the coffin and collected the body. The patrol boat has returned to Song. Patrol Officer Guan Kekong, in addition to reporting the situation to the district department, because the policeman died in the line of duty, his parents are above and his children are below, and they are very poor, resulting in the destruction of the old and the young, who are completely dependent on him.

<p>Shanghai Leprosy Association Agrees to Donate 5,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The construction of the Xiamen Leprosy Hospital is about to begin, as reported previously. According to news from the Shanghai Chinese Leprosy Relief Association, its Nanchang branch also plans to establish a leprosy hospital. However, due to frequent impact from the current situation and harassment by the Communist Party, it has been delayed. In view of the actual needs, it is difficult to delay any longer. Therefore, the entire board of directors of the branch recently decided to build a part of it first, with four houses, each of which can accommodate ten people, as well as an office and a bathhouse, in order to meet the urgent need. In terms of funding, in addition to the 3,000 yuan raised locally and the land donated by former Mayor Wu, the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association has previously agreed to provide 5,000 yuan to cover the construction costs. However, once the hospital is established, the annual recurring expenses will be at least 5,000 yuan or more. At present, in addition to the subsidy from the provincial government of more than 1,800 yuan for the old leprosy hospital, which can be transferred, there is no funding for all the insufficient funds. The head office in Shanghai and the branch are now trying their best to raise funds separately to achieve the goal.</p>

<p>Responsibility Issues for Speculative Business</p>
<p>Manager Fang Shunyuan Accused</p>
<p>Liu Yusheng and others jointly hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint in the French Concession Court, stating that the plaintiffs and defendant Fang Shunyuan jointly opened the Yiji Seafood Store in the administration a few years ago and elected the defendant as the manager. Unexpectedly, it closed down in March this year, after being open for one year and four months, with a total capital of 48,000 양. Now the loss is 70,000 양. It was found that the contract stipulated that only seafood business could be done and no speculative business could be done. Unexpectedly, the defendant Fang Shunyuan privately engaged in speculative business, resulting in such a huge loss. Rumors are rife, saying that Yiji has suffered huge losses, so the shareholders had no choice but to declare liquidation. In this situation, the defendant clearly violated the crime of breach of trust and requested a trial, and should also bear civil liability. The defendant also pleaded through a lawyer that the plaintiff's accusation was unfounded. It should be known whether the 日金 transaction was proposed by the defendant personally or agreed by the shareholders. The Yiji seal was fully stamped on the transaction order. The seal has always been managed by the plaintiff Liu Qingcong, indicating that the 日金 transaction was actually made with the consent of the shareholders. Moreover, the red list at the end of the year clearly stated the speculative losses and was registered in the account book by the plaintiff, which can prove that this transaction was actually agreed by the shareholders. How can the defendant be held responsible?</p>
<p>The request is for a detailed investigation to dismiss the case. Judge Zhu instructed the defendant to pay a deposit and wait outside. Accountant Wu will investigate the accounts to determine whether the defendant should be held responsible and report back for verification.</p>

She relied on what she earned to raise her son. Now that Fuyuan is twenty-two years old, he is甘趨下流, refuses to work, and spends his days idle and addicted to gambling. He has repeatedly been warned but refuses to mend his ways. Recently, he has pawned his clothes and is almost exhausted, and still wants to ask for money to use. I am nearly sixty years old and my health is deteriorating day by day. How can I continue to support him? Therefore, I summoned relatives to beat him and filled他滿with repentance and self-renewal. Unexpectedly, after the relatives left, he pushed me to the ground and crossed his feet. I shouted in pain and was persuaded to leave by neighbors. Only such an unruly child should be strictly investigated. Chen Fuyuan confessed that the plaintiff was indeed his biological mother, but after his father died, she had an affair with a hooligan surnamed Chen. The relationship was extremely intimate. At first, it was 明來暗往, but now they live together and regard me as a thorn in their side. I was very angry and gave a little advice. Unexpectedly, my mother became angry and instigated many people to beat me and injure my whole body. I was angry for a while and also punched a few times.

<p>Zhao Jintang Nearly Suffered Injustice</p>
<p>Lin Lanying, a woman from Danyang, is 21 years old and of good looks. She came to Shanghai to work in April of this year. The day before yesterday, she went to the porridge shop opened by Lao Niu in Menggu Road, Zhabei, to look for her fellow countryman Zhao Jintang (who works in the porridge shop). Zhao immediately 款待 Lanying to eat porridge. Unexpectedly, Yue Agui, a fellow countryman who claimed to be a committee member in the 1st Division and 2nd Regiment of the 教導, entered and forcefully accused Zhao of abducting Lanying and turned him over to the 1st Precinct of the 4th District. According to Yao the precinct chief's interrogation, Yue Agui confessed that he is 26 years old and is now a committee member of the 教導團. Lanying escaped from home and her mother asked me to look for her. Today I met her and urged her to go home, but she refused, which is obviously an affair with Zhao. When asked about this, Lin Lanying confessed that I informed my parents that I came to Shanghai to work and now I plan to go home. Today I asked Zhao if there were any family letters to bring back and there was nothing else. Yue Agui does not know me and intends to extort money from me, but he failed, so he turned me over to the police. When Zhao Jintang was interrogated, he confessed that he was 25 years old and that he and Lanying were fellow countrymen. Yao the precinct chief 核供 that Yue claimed that Lanying's mother asked him to look for Lanying, but there was no evidence. Lanying now wants to go home and bring back family letters for her fellow countrymen, which is a reasonable thing. Observing the situation between Lanying and Zhao, there is obviously no affair. Yue, who is now a recruiter, should not interfere in personnel matters. He was immediately severely reprimanded and ordered to be released together to close the case.</p>

<p>He Stole from Neighbors at the Age of Ten</p>
<p>He Recently Stole Gold Rings and Silver Hairpins</p>
<p>Wen Qiyu, a boy from Tianjin, also known as Xiao Gouzi, is 14 years old and lives at No. 38 Luxi Street, Dongjiadu, Nanshi. The boy has always been bad-natured. He learned to be down-and-out at the age of ten and specialized in privately taking miscellaneous items and money from neighbors for use. The year before last, he went straight to Zhabei and privately牽了 a mule raised by someone and was arrested after being discovered. Because he was still young, he was not investigated in depth and was released back home. As a result, he became more daring. The nearby area all knew that Xiao Gouzi's behavior was improper and had long been suspicious of him. The day before yesterday, the Wang family on Qinglong Bridge celebrated their birthday and specially summoned Jiang Fuchen from Wuxi to their home to chant the scriptures. While he was 복星拜斗, Xiao Gouzi took the opportunity to sneak in and secretly stole a gold ring and a silver hairpin placed on the plate and took the loot to a certain pawnshop on Wangjiajiaozui to pawn them. He pawned the gold ring for seven yuan and then went to the Big World in Beishi to游覧. He caught a glimpse of the machine gun horse gambling game in the venue and entered the game to gamble. In a short while, the seven yuan he brought was completely lost. He did not return to the Wang family until around 12 pm. After the gold ring and silver hairpin were lost, they were anxious.

They waited until late at night to see him return and immediately called Gao Xiangzhou, the guard police of the 10th Post in the area, to arrest him and take him to the 1st Sub-Precinct of the管一區 for preliminary interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Declarations from Various Unions in Zhabei <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Assisting the Fengtang Porcelain Union</p>
<p>To the Shanghai newspaper offices and all compatriots in the city: Please be aware that we remember last year on this day, the Shanghai Fengtang Porcelain Factory Union once initiated a labor strike to demand improvements in living conditions and the signing of employment contracts. Unexpectedly, the factory owners, relying on personal connections with the Hong case, used the excuse of a strike to cut off the livelihood of the workers. We and other organizations, located in Zhabei, having heard of this, believe that under party rule, our workers should strive to escape from inhuman living conditions.</p>
<p>As our compatriots at the Fengtang factory face this kind of threat and oppression and appeal for help, how can we stand idly by? Moreover, the success or failure of the Fengtang factory owners’ methods is truly a test for all factory owners in Shanghai. If they succeed in implementing it, others will follow suit, and the entire labor movement in Shanghai will gradually be wiped out. For the sake of others, for our own sake, and for the sake of the future of the revolution, in addition to jointly submitting a petition to the party and government authorities to severely punish the Fengtang factory owners, we also hope that all workers and compatriots from all walks of life in Shanghai will extend their sympathy and assistance. This is not only the fortune of the Fengtang Union but also the fortune of the entire Shanghai labor movement. This is our declaration.</p>
<p>The Entire Committee of the Commercial Press Union, The Staff and Workers Union of the General Affairs Department of the Commercial Press, The Staff and Workers Union of the Compilation and Translation Department of the Commercial Press, The Staff and Workers Union of the Distribution Department of the Commercial Press, The British-Owned Water and Fire Company Union, The Huazhuang Binding Zhabei District Union, The Renhe Cigar Factory Union, The Yongtai Cigar Factory Union, The Jingyi Leather Factory Union, The Pig Bristle Union, The Organ Industry Union, The Mirror Wood Union, The Tattoo Workers Union, The China Merchant Public Bus Workers Union, The Preparatory Committee of the Yunfei Automobile Union, The Yifeng Porcelain Factory Union, The Coal and Firewood Industry Union, The Qingde Rubber Factory Union, The Seventh Silk Factory Workers Union, The Eighth Silk Factory Workers Union, The Tiancheng Silk Weaving Union, The Auto Painting Union, The Sino-Foreign Printing Union, and more than thirty other unions.</p>
<h3 id="e157">County Magistrate Yan's Report on Budget Preparation <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>At the Shanghai County Government's weekly memorial service this morning, County Magistrate Yan reported on the preparation of the 19th year's budget, saying that today is June 30th, the end of the 18th year, and tomorrow is July 1st, the beginning of the 19th year. The things the local government should do in the future all depend on whether the 19th year's budget can be prepared and finalized. If the budget cannot be finalized, the progress of various undertakings will face difficulties. Therefore, the county government has paid great attention to the preparation of the 19th year's budget. First, it notified all county-affiliated agencies to submit their budget proposals to the county for compilation before June 15th. Subsequently, the county-affiliated agencies submitted their budgets one after another. After review, it was found that the County Education Bureau had more income, and the budget could barely be established. The Construction Bureau had a slight surplus in the 18th year, but starting from the 19th year, the provincial subsidies were canceled, and the administrative expenses were felt to be difficult. The surplus funds for undertakings were exhausted, and there were also concerns about future shortages. The public security expenses were originally allocated by the city government, which seemed unrelated to the county funds. However, currently, only half of the allocation has been made, which is still insufficient. It is necessary to reduce administrative expenses and police salaries as much as possible. In addition, the replenishment of clothing and firearms requires funds at any time, and it is difficult to raise them. The current budgets of various districts are insufficient. The first district is relatively better, while the second and third districts and below are very difficult. The expenses of the County Party Headquarters and the Agricultural Field are completely without funding. The county government previously received a request from the director of the County Agricultural Field to reassess the land price in order to levy agricultural improvement donations based on the acreage to allocate to the field's expenses. Therefore, it convened several meetings to discuss the reassessment of the land price. As a result, the proposal of the County Agricultural Field has been rejected. The intention of the county government is to work together to establish the 19th year's budget and bring the Shanghai local government onto the right track. However, the people's capacity to bear it is limited, and the county government has no intention of forcing its passage. However, the representatives of various agencies who participate in the budget meeting must broaden their horizons and consider the entire county, not just the agency they represent, and also consider the agencies that have no funding. No matter how difficult it is, we should strive to prepare the 19th year's budget and ensure that the county administration in the 19th year is a little more advanced than in the 18th year.</p>

When questioned, Wangshi stated that she had only been working as a maid at the plaintiff's house for a short time and would not dare to commit theft. She was being falsely accused. She asked the judge to rule that the evidence presented by the plaintiff was insufficient and to dismiss the case.</p>

<p>Shao Jingzhi, the director of the Dadong News Agency in this city and a native of Nanhui, recently observed that the area is vast and many incidents occur daily. However, due to transportation limitations, it is difficult to know the truth even between places ten miles apart, which is truly regrettable. Furthermore, many fellow villagers are working in other places and want to know the details of their hometown news, but there is no suitable newspaper to meet their needs, which is also regrettable. As for grand pronouncements and reform plans, they cannot be fully announced. Shao believes that this phenomenon is hindering the development of Nanhui, especially in this era where public opinion represents the will of the people and is a precursor to industrial development. Therefore, he hosted a banquet in Nanhui the other day, inviting people from the Party, government, business, academic, and military circles to organize the Xin Nanhui Bao. Preparations are now complete, and the inaugural issue will be published on the 15th of this month. After that, a large broadsheet will be published every six days. The newspaper is a local newspaper that does not discuss politics and economics. Shao will be in charge, and Zhu Wenyuan has been invited to be the editor-in-chief. The office is temporarily located in Nanhui City. It is said that all newspaper vendors in this city will sell it.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Record of the Sino-Foreign Rickshaw Merchant Association Meeting <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Rickshaw Merchant Association of this city convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon. The meeting proceeded as usual. The meeting items were: (1) Proposal to set up public tea pavilions. (2) Proposal to distribute Summer Heat Relief Water. (3) Proposal to find ways to maintain business in light of the skyrocketing prices of rubber, hardware, and vehicle materials. (4) Proposal to prepare the iron sheets for the summonses by the association itself. The public unanimously elected Bao Guoxiang as the chairman. He reported to the public on the purpose of the meeting and the matters to be discussed, stating that the association should, as an example, set up more tea pavilions at the entrances of various roads in the summer to provide coolies with tea to drink, and also distribute Summer Heat Relief Water from various companies to provide emergency relief to coolie rickshaw pullers suffering from heatstroke. However, these two proposals have already been implemented, but they must be reported to everyone. Gu Songfa and Xi Yingchuan then spoke in succession, all saying that the current skyrocketing prices of rubber, hardware, vehicle materials, etc., are due to the influence of gold prices, and the meager rickshaw rents collected by the various companies are insufficient to cover costs. The rubber and hardware material industry has also declared price increases. If our fellow members continue to collect rents as before, it will be difficult to make ends meet. If we allow the prices of rubber and hardware vehicle materials to rise without falling, our business losses will be impossible to make up. We should find ways to maintain and subsidize them. After discussion by the members, the only way is to slightly increase the rickshaw rents to subsidize them, otherwise, there is no other way to save this situation. The motion was then passed immediately. Finally, it was agreed that the iron sheets for the summonses on the rickshaws should be handled by the association itself in accordance with Zhu Lawyer's letter, and will be handled after a letter to the Finance Bureau. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Xi Chenshi Asks the Pharmaceutical Industry Association for Assistance <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Chen, the wife of Xi Shaofeng, the owner of the Xi Changsheng Tang pharmacy in Zhabei, submitted a petition to the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association yesterday, stating: "With tears, the petitioner Xi Chenshi respectfully presents this petition to the executive committee members of the Shanghai National Pharmaceutical Industry Association: The clerk of the store, Luo Xishun, has a habitual addiction and is out all day long. Therefore, he has no accomplishments in the store's work, and after returning to the store, he quarrels with the friends and the store owner. In short, his sins are too numerous to mention. My husband, Shaofeng, has repeatedly wanted to dismiss him, but because he has the union to protect him, he has never been able to do so, causing my husband, Shaofeng, to become depressed and mentally disordered. A few days ago, he went out of his mind and lost his slippers, causing my family to cry and panic. Everyone thought that if there were any accidents, the whole store would be like a ship without a rudder, losing its master, and how would we live in the future? After searching through the newspapers, fortunately, the second branch of the second district of the Public Security Bureau sent him back, but only his breath remained. Currently, he is being treated by a doctor, and he has slightly recovered, but he is still constantly calling for Luo Xishun to harm him. In this situation, I have no choice but to submit this petition to the association for assistance, praying that it will be forwarded to the Social Affairs Bureau and consulted with the union to allow the store to dismiss Luo Xishun so that my husband's heart disease can still be cured with a heart medicine. Otherwise, if my husband becomes more depressed or suffers an accident, not only will my family lose its livelihood, but the livelihoods of the friends in the store will also be unable to be preserved, which is not the way of people's livelihood. In short, if Luo Xishun can be dismissed, it will not only be the good fortune of my family but also the good fortune of the friends, and it will be the good fortune of the people's livelihood of society. I cannot express my hope enough. I respectfully submit this petition, etc." It is heard that the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association has forwarded the petition to the Social Affairs Bureau for review.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Letter Received <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor: With utmost respect, yesterday I read in your newspaper's local news section a report on the Health Bureau's conscientious epidemic prevention work, in which my company and the Zu'an Company were reprimanded for preventing workers from receiving injections, etc. At the same time, I received a letter from the Health Bureau to my company with the same content. I believe that the Health Bureau's move to protect workers and prevent cholera is beneficial to the working population and protects manufacturers. Manufacturers generally deeply appreciate this and see no need to prevent it. However, the doctor at the time did not follow hygiene procedures, causing a reaction from the workers. After your newspaper published the report, I fear that those who do not know the truth will cause misunderstandings between labor and capital, which is greatly related to the future of the factory. In addition to replying to the Health Bureau with the facts, I am sending the original manuscript to be published, and I would be grateful. I wish you peace and prosperity. From Lin Zhetong, July 6th, with the Xiangya Company's seal.</p>
<p>Attached is the original letter to the Health Bureau: Responding with respect, I have just received your bureau's letter, which states that according to reports, the bureau sent a doctor to your factory on the 2nd of this month to provide free cholera vaccinations to the workers. The workers were about to ask for the vaccinations, but the executives of your factory not only did not enthusiastically supervise and encourage the acceptance of the vaccinations but also added to the obstruction. This unintentional move is nothing more than thinking that the workers' vaccinations will inevitably cost one or two minutes of work time. It can be seen that your factory values private profits more than workers' health, and your vision is short-sighted and your love for the community is weak, which is regrettable. Now, we will still send doctors to your factory to provide free cholera vaccinations to the workers. We hope that the executives of your factory can accept good advice and not obstruct the workers from enjoying the benefits of free prevention. That is the most important thing. After reading this, I was deeply surprised. After the manager was not notified of the doctor sent by your bureau to the factory on July 2, and when the doctor from your bureau arrived at the factory, the factory workers Xu Liangfa, Zhou Debao, and Fang Ermei received the injections. Later, when it came to the pharmacist Huang Zao to start the injections, Huang Zao said that the workers' bodies were mostly unclean and the doctor did not first wipe the skin with alcohol, and the needles used by the doctor were not washed with disinfectant after three injections. He was deeply afraid that he would not be able to prevent cholera but would be infected, so he asked the doctor to disinfect according to hygiene laws before injecting. The doctor did not allow it, so he stopped. I think that the original intention of your bureau chief in sending personnel to give injections was to prevent cholera and benefit the people. However, if the needles used by the doctor were not disinfected at all, the savior would be harming people. It both betrays your bureau chief's love for workers and love for the community and cannot match the trust of the workers in their lives. The doctor did not blame himself for his negligence but added the crime of disregarding workers' health, short-sightedness, and lack of love for the community to the factory executives. I don't know that the factory executives' request for the doctor to disinfect is to protect the workers' lives and show love for the community. The former by letter responded to the correspondence and asked for a change to inform your doctor must follow hygienic laws when performing injections and disinfect the tools and skin at the time of the injection to prevent infection. This pays respect to the Shanghai City Health Bureau Chief.</p>
