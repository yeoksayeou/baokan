<p>英國工黨政府下之煤礦案</p>

<p>接要聞　　自已已無辦法、對全國信用完全失去、在革命立場上、已無人能再相信他了、他就騙出馮玉祥、向中央搗亂、當馮未離晉以前、趙院長還來電説是閻錫山不但是願下野、並要出洋、因爲閻只下野而不出洋、就無法可使馮玉祥不回陜西、如此山西就是很危險了、不如閻馮偕同出洋、就可轉移國人目光、真有和平希望、這是趙院長來電、並謂困求實現和平、要變換國民的目光、所以閻錫山不但下野、且要出洋、所以中央就答應他的要求、山西方面就由趙院長維持、後接趙電、謂爲國家和平起見、極願犧牲其個人、暫維一切、及十日馮玉祥到了潼關、我們才知道閻錫山的所謂下野出洋、皆是假的、他説和平統一云云、完全不是這回事、他想擾亂黨國、自已的力量不够、又要馮玉祥來代他擾亂、由此一來、閻錫山在革命的歷史上革命的立塲上更加喪失無餘了、我們從前還希望閻錫山果能出洋、必可增長學識、變易目光、將來回國、還可敎他爲國家担任點事情、現在看他的行爲、確是隂險奸詐的封建軍閥、他以爲封建思想還可存在、實則他的所爲、他的政治生命早已破産了、以後他是再不能和十八年以前一様的在革命上可以敷衍過去的了、現在閻錫山在北方又大造空氣、説中央軍於十五日在滄州彰德集中、要直取河北、所以他又不出洋了、這真是笑話、那有這回事呢、我們知道、德州距天津是很近的、幾小時就可到達、上次晋軍擅自開兵到德州、而中央軍隊即令後退、以後并未調一兵一卒到那裏、并且此次中央軍隊始終未過黄河、這様看來、究竟那一個是和平、那一個是破壞和平·自有公論的、這次他又説中央出兵攻他、這又是完全揑造事實、現在望各位同志全國同胞大家要趕緊準備起來、這次反動派的聯合、我認爲對革命前途有無窮樂觀、因爲反動派不聯合、革命是不會成功的、所以反動勢力越大、就是消滅得越快、現在政府是確有消滅反動的力量、收拾全局的把握、並非説什麽大話、各位可以切實相信的、所以我們深怕反動派不聯合、反動不明顯、我聽説西北軍已於十五日發出反叛通電、並且奉他們中華民國軍總司令閻錫山副司令馮玉祥的命令、集中兵力、出了潼關來進攻我們了、但是中央宗旨、總是和平、抱着很堅忍的意志、很穏健的態度、我們待反動勢力暴露殆盡、再不能不用兵的時候、然後方起來去消滅他、所以中央此時决取守勢、待國民皆知道他們叛跡顯著、中央再加討伐、他是不能不屈伏的、深望全國同胞與各位同志知道中央是絶對希望和平的、絶對取着守勢、不單是不去進攻他們、並且要本和平初衷、還要向後撤退、以待叛軍來攻的時候、再同他們决一死戰達到我們掃除障碍完成革命的目的」、報告畢散會、中央第七十九次常會　　十七日下午、第七十九次中央常務會議、</p>

<p>行者六人。一攝影家。兩音樂家。各携所愛之工具以往。午後二時附淞滬車起程。於砲台灣下車。甫出站門。即見江光潑眼。氣味爽俊。呼吸皆爲之大快。是日雖妍日當空。曝背頗含暖意。而風勢殊峻烈。以近海故。風力益强。吾輩遵水濱前進。至一灣角。遂緣堤而下。共坐石間談話。潮水時侵及足際。寒意甚深。風又劈面如割。第皆忍受之。無一示怯意者。携樂器之友。以風盛不能作樂。携攝影箱之友。因冒險據一石上。爲吾輩留影。時適有一日本商輪。鼓浪而過。潮來愈疾。此石竟爲水所没。友急躍回岸際。腿部以下已全濕矣。坐談約半小時。始離此同赴吳淞。　　自砲台灣缘堤至吳淞鎭。路程約三里弱。吾輩淹留上海。故鄉况味。久已未嘗。環游淞市一匝。覺其境味之簡樸淡永。别有風趣。共擇江濱一茶樓小坐休息。攝影之友則往碼頭上攝取社會上之各種活動事態。如船户修理破船。税關人員查艙。賣菜傭聚坐着象棋。均被其一一攝入。此君洵善於選材也。淞市市面似尙不惡。特除一二家綢緞店外。較大之商店甚少。有一洋貨店且高揭召盤字様。殆因去上海過近。經營不易。歸時仍附乘淞滬車。見路畔楊柳。多已抽芽。覺吾輩長日居滬。於潮霧烟煤中討生活。偶作效游。生命亦似經一度洗浴。精神上覺愉快非凡也。胡石予先生鑒頃有朱君瘦桐欲與先生通信請以地址逕函商務印書館編譯所胡寄塵君轉致朱君爲荷自由談部敬啓錫山梅園探梅兼覽蠡湖諸勝偕默君  邵元冲　　碧玉渟泓一鑑開。寒香萬本費栽培。水村處處輞川畫。可有花光人夢來。香雪無邊破碧寥。諸峯聳翠壓春潮。江臯冷艷年年發。野鶴無心未可招。香沁詩脾洗醉紅。高樓寒翠挹天風。繁花如雪春如海。萬頃湖光旭照中。鬱鬱天馨發古枝。不隨凡艷鬥新姿。湖山留得春長在。林下風流有所思。十九年春梁谿探梅偕翼如  張默君　　嫩晴如畫媚芳辰。一葉蠡湖破曉春。香海蒼茫空翠合。萬梅低首拜詩人。一鏡澄涵千嶂開。暗香深處儘低徊。翛然人影和天碧。風挾松濤捲地來。屏開山色落湖光。雲水遥洄玉照堂。耿此幽懷坐寥廓。與君天外聽寒香。絶憐風骨太嶙峋。合共癯僊住上清。鶴自無心招未得。千秋水月定同盟。夕陽紅瘦雨餘天。呼艇還參緑萼僊。一片冰心無著處。春迴太古總孤妍。婀娜東風散玉塵。迴谿十里柳條新。山泉不管滄桑換。獨抱疎林瀉古春。海外茶話  天朋自東京寄　　電話式之結婚美國德琪沙司州哇可市娜西侣女士。與呵合育司州里巫市何馬君舉行電話結婚式。市判事與證婚人及新郎新娘。同時均用電話通告六分鐘即已成禮電話所費尙未及十金。而終身大事告成。此實爲世界最廉最速之結婚新紀録。　　紐約市之空氣　紐約爲世界四大城市之一。人烟稠密。烟囱轟立。空氣極劣。當局力謀救濟、據最近塵汚測量器之結果。全市空氣以午前四時之間。最爲清潔無塵。午前九時許最汚濁齷齪。市民養生者以早起爲宜。前有人測東方紐約之上海空氣。以天將曉時爲最佳。午後爲最劣。惟時表尙難確定耳。　　胡佛之垂釣癮　胡佛總統於公餘每以垂釣爲樂。時於房餌尼亞山莊臨流效太公望之逸興。近際禁漁時期。胡氏守法遂罷釣遊。州當道。因此擬將禁律修正。凡有特殊资格者得特准垂釣。不在禁止之列。胡氏雅不願開此特例。故堅决辭絶。　　美人之新迷信　新大陸之美國。科學夙稱發達。而迷信却依然盛行。近莫沙州第一著名墓地。陀多立其牧師之新墳落成。有一跛足婦人往展拜竟而足完好如初。此奇蹟遂轟動遠近善男信女。紛往祈求福澤。且各携墓士少許歸去。主敎乃出令禁止否則不久勢必士盡見棺矣。雲蒸霞蔚之蜜蜂畫展  賀天健　　蜜蜂畫展自開幕以來。倐已數日。參觀之人甚形踴躍。而社員加入者亦　　如雨後春笋。可見社會之注重藝術。而藝術亦爲人生之急需也。　　名收藏家除曾農髯閻甘園許修直許小南洋游記（十）  靈花　　返女校晚餐。夜返舟中。西貢有蚊。夜熱不寐。又未帶蚊帳。頗困。十七年上午訪民國日報彭勝天君談。彭爲黨員。論甚平實。余希望在海外注重自治團體并約有志研究自治學術。蓋此爲專門之學。又爲盎格沙遜民族特有之性。其殖民全球。並非專賴政府之力。大半由人民自治團體積漸發展形成之舉。其事實英滅印度在一八六一年。乃一家印度商會。ＴheEastIndeaTradingCompany初只一數百鎊之探險會社。後乃赢印度之利。練其兵而執其政。旣收印度。乃報英王。英王大驚。久乃允之。然主持其事者。乃一商會書記克雷非其人也。由此可證西人殖民能力。不全靠政府。猶之班超以三十六人横行收服西域數十國。並非真正時時有政府爲後盾也。此精神須遠研希拉及中世基爾特制。與漢沙同盟Ｈansa中世各地村市政府之聯合。以重舊羅馬之能。延長。哥侖布新大陸之探險。達爾文之航海之動物采集。均商人帮助成之。非呆靠政府者。今我國革命政府之創造原動力。中山先生實憑華僑之力以首創之。此後仍須繼續努力。内完成建設。外發展自治經濟文化之事。比較東西長短。而圖進化成功。惟僑胞自治團體是賴矣。　　與陳開清君過三山會館。陳云。此爲吾閩數縣之團體。乃一天后宫。供水母觀音。搆造華好。聯語均甚合易經地水之義。與佛家禪語。爲有學之人所書。内有二僧。一通官話。名明妙。曾到上海。問有佛經否。乃取金剛經阿彌陀經來。問其義稍明白。蓋有心之和尙。問以安南佛敎。曰詎此一天路有丁定山。爲一大觀音廟。有僧人住之。但本地僧人不定吃素。而中國僧人尙禁酒肉。本寺内貼禁條。不許一切人飲酒。尙可觀也。余乃贈以金陵刻經處之飄海觀音像。并觀音卍緣會章程。。彼甚喜。仙丁輔之張善孖李祖韓項松茂吳幼潛諸君外。又加入哈少甫秦清曾諸君。所出之品。皆爲藝苑精英。平時不易得見。諸君於該社肯如此熱心贊助。自可見該社此次藝術運動之鄭重矣。　　社員作品除本刋上次所紀外。又有汪英賓之山水。熊松泉之走獸。陳寳廉之山水。張雪揚之山水。陳小蝶之山水。商笙伯唐吉生之歲朝圖。秦清曾之山水。閻甘園之字。馬孟容之花鳥。王箇簃之花卉。黄曉汀之山水。陳倚石之人物。鄭曼青之花卉。沈子丞之仕女。吳子鼎之仕女。王季眉之山水。沈立民之人物。吳青霞之花鳥。吳雪瑶之花卉。皆爲一時精到之作。海上藝術之花。將由以上諸君而狂放矣。　　昨日爲社員聚餐會之期。即就會場舉行。酒後興酣落筆。合作畫作甚多。間有老詩人奚燕子題詩。小子射逢盛會。不能自已。爰作小詩以紀其事。儻逢盛會。不能佳話乎。詩云。海上題襟幾刧灰。風流頓歇亦哀哉。豈知一隊丹青客。又作負香汲水來。　　今日社友謝公展所畫之合景屏條四幅。先有林君定購一條。旋又有楊君爭購全</p>

<p>緊。東西却是要好。他於名伎中。從前過去的人物。却已經搜集了不少。但是不過聊備一格而已。自然是新人物占多數。這三四百幀小影中。果然也有一個人不止一影。但是姿勢必定全不同。也有許多人攝在一起的。也有兩三個人合攝的。一個人的單獨照片。當然是尤其多了。他正在搜集之中。所以極歡迎他們去照相。今天來的姑娘中。有幾個就是前天捉迷藏之日來的。也有幾位是那天没有來的。一半是來補拍照相。一半却是來看跑馬。像陳絳雲。花蕊雲輩都没有來。前天没有來的。今天却來了一位喚做麗春的。肌膚皎如霜雪。身軀農若柳枝。也是和鄭彥修最相熟。還有一位喚做碧犀館。也是海士名伎之一。這一人倜儻風流。好比紅樓夢中的史湘雲一般。。喜歡大説大笑的。人家也就喜歡伊的没有兒女羞澀之態。還有一位喚做么王文桂枝。那時不是説上海堂子裏有兩位大王嗎。一位是野雞大王素君。前書中已經説過。一位便是么二大王文桂枝了。大槪伊是出身於么二妓院的。所以有此名稱。可見從前的階級主義是到處都有的。一個妓院中。也分了好幾種階級。么二就比長三低了一級。長三妓院的視么二。便有些兒蔑視態度。因爲文桂枝是么二妓院裏出身。所以現在雖是已經和他們平等。也是升到了長三了。這么二兩字。好像終身洗不去的了。宛如出身低微的官僚。或是他的祖若父。是做過一種什麽低微的職業的。便一輩子做了談柄。又像那種士豪巨神。出身是低微的。直到做了當地的聞人以後。人家還忘不了他的舊職業。在他名字之上。冠以舊時的職業一股。文桂枝</p>
<p>也是如此。因爲伊是么二中崛起的人物。所以稱之爲么二大王。簡稱則爲么王。。</p>

<p>Signs of Movement in the Northwest Army</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang Arrives in Shaanzhou, Troops Gather Between Shaanxi and Tongguan</p>
<p>Taiyuan Military Conference Decides on War Preparations</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Road News: Feng Yuxiang has now arrived in Shaanzhou.</p>
<p>(Exclusive Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Beiping, 17th Telegram: (1) Yan [Xishan] has used Ju Qin’s northwest [forces] to urge them to advance east; it is heard that 2 million yuan in cash has been issued. (2) The Jin army's Sun Chu and Feng Pengzhu's two divisions have retreated to areas behind Shunde, Zhanghe, Cizhou, and Shizhuang, where they are concentrating their troops, preparing for two possible actions. (3) The majority of the Northwest Army is still concentrated between Shaanzhou and Tongguan. (4) It is heard that the results of the Taiyuan military conference on the 13th include: 1. The Jin side's generals jointly sent a telegram requesting Yan to cease going abroad; 2. Actively prepare for war; 3. Pre-allocate military expenses; 4. Levy grain and fodder; 5. Send politicians to agitate; 6. Buy off miscellaneous troops for sacrificial purposes; 7. Attack the Pinghan and Jinpu lines with all strength; 8. Purchase a large batch of military supplies from a certain country and order the Taiyuan Arsenal to rush the manufacture of munitions. (Exclusive Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today's Zhengzhou telegram from the Pinghan Railway Bureau states that traffic between Han [Hankou] and Zheng [Zhengzhou] is normal. Wan Xuancai's troops are still in Luo [Luoyang], Han [Fuju] is in Zheng [Zhengzhou], and Shi [Yousan] is in Xinxiang. The troops stationed in the Hebei-Henan border area are still in harmony. (Exclusive Dispatch, 17th) (Beiping) Feng Pengzhu arrived in Taiyuan today. The Fourth Security Command Headquarters is established in Zhangjiakou, with the 10th Brigade stationed in Datong, the 11th stationed in Zhangjiakou, and the 12th Brigade stationed in Suiyuan. Qin Shaoguan will go to Zhang [Zhangjiakou] within days. (Exclusive Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jian Youwen said that the report of Feng's arrival in Tongguan still needs to be confirmed. When I left Taiyuan a few days ago, Mr. Feng had a plan to return to Tongguan for discussion, but Taiyuan has no telegram reporting whether Feng has gone to Tongguan or not. (Exclusive Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The long-distance passenger train on the Pinghan Line has already reached Handan directly on the 16th. The Railway Bureau is recovering the carriages seized by various armies and restoring commercial transportation. (Exclusive Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yuan Jiasheng, the former Jinbei Division Commander, has come to Beiping and will go to Jin [Shanxi] to visit Yan [Xishan] and Feng [Yuxiang] within days. (Exclusive Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Pinghan Railway Bureau received a telegram from Zheng [Zhengzhou] stating that the situation here is not as serious as reported. People in Tianjin-Beiping and Europe and America judge the current situation to be unlikely to lead to war, because a certain country hopes that China will continue to be in internal chaos in order to resolve the Manchuria and Mongolia issues, so it is carrying out all kinds of instigation and propaganda, and entrusting Europeans and Americans to forward this news to various countries. After verification, some of it is false, so it was not approved for forwarding. In addition, the Belgian and Dutch technical advisors of the Longhai Railway recently telegraphed that the situation in Henan is not as serious as reported. Judging from the situation from all sides, the psychological state of all parties waiting for economic and power-based opportunities is still sufficient, so war seems avoidable. (Exclusive Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Generals such as Shang Zhen issued a joint telegram on the 15th, earnestly requesting Yan Xishan to assume the post of Commander-in-Chief. (Jiji News Agency Telegram, 17th) (Beiping) For several days, the 37th Division has begun to move towards the Jinpu Railway line, the 38th Division has begun to move towards the Pinghan Railway line, and the 44th and 41st Divisions have moved from Shijiazhuang to Taiyuan. A certain number of garrison troops were transported from Taiyuan to the south, and all of Shi Yousan's troops moved to the north bank of the Yellow River. Zhengzhou currently only has one brigade of Han Fuju's forces.</p>

<p>(Beiping) A portion of the Jin army's 43rd Division on the Jinpu Line destroyed the railway near the town north of Dezhou. (Dentsu News Agency Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang [Kai-shek] held a memorial week at the National Government on the morning of the 17th. Afterwards, in the chairman's reception room, he summoned Fan Xiangli, Political Vice-Minister of the Interior, Li Tongsheng, Director of the General Affairs Department, Wang Tingyang, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Cai Guanghui, Director of the Police Affairs Department, Xi Chulin, Director of the Rites and Customs Department, and others to consult on everything.

<p>The Coal Mine Issue Under the British Labour Government</p>
<p>The spokesman of the British Miners' Federation said that miners in various coal regions are asking the Federation to convene a national miners' conference, saying that the government may fail in Congress because of this. This is truly wise. Generally speaking, after a kind of power is established in the world, its failure is rarely due to external forces, but mostly due to internal forces. Therefore, the failure of the British Labour Government will not be due to the opposition Conservative Party and Liberal Party, nor to the newly established United Party, but to the workers' issue within the Labour Party itself. Why? Although other parties attack every day, they are still easy to deal with because of different party doctrines. If under the Labour government, workers' groups express dissatisfaction, it is like using one's own spear to attack one's own shield, and the foothold has already shaken, making it difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>Therefore, much internal strife in a country gives foreign countries an opportunity for aggression; much internal strife within a party gives outside parties an opportunity for attack; much internal strife within a group gives outside groups an opportunity for elimination; much internal strife within an army gives the enemy an opportunity for victory. This is a definite and irresistible opportunity. Even the able are powerless. Therefore, internal opposition is greatly to be feared. The ancients said that victory in war depends on harmony, not on numbers. Harmony means no internal strife. This is true in all things, not only in warfare.</p>
<p>Today, people's minds are becoming more and more developed, knowledge is becoming more and more advanced, things are becoming more and more complex, interests are becoming more and more intense, and the hearts of suspicion and speculation are becoming more and more intricate. It is not easy to avoid internal strife in every internal group.</p>

<p>Reports That He [Yingqin] Will Command the Pinghan Line Is Not Accurate</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin reported at the military affairs memorial week on the morning of the 17th that since Yan [Xishan] published his fallacious theories, he has been secretly transferring troops and generals, blocking transportation on the Jinpu, Longhai, and Pinghan lines, causing social order to relapse into turmoil. Recently, Yan has superficially telegraphed his resignation and retirement to go abroad, but on the one hand he is still in Taiyuan, convening military conferences, and on the other hand he released Feng [Yuxiang] back to Tongguan. The so-called going abroad and retiring is completely because internal opinions could not be unified, so he proposed this relaxed atmosphere to deceive the people. Since the founding of the Republic of China, Yan has occupied Shanxi for more than ten years, specializing in using other people's sacrifices and reaping the benefits of the fisherman. This time, he still wants to use the Northwest Army, but the Northwest Army was greatly fooled by Yan last year. Although they still cooperate superficially, they are actually still at odds. If Yan can stop in time and wake up early, and return military and political power to the central government, he may be able to win people's forgiveness and leniency. If he still obstinately persists and willingly colludes with all reactionary elements, painstakingly plotting to undermine national peace and unity, the result will only be to perish together with the reactionary elements. (Exclusive Dispatch, 17th) (Nanjing) Visited He Yingqin on the evening of the 17th. He was busy, so Wang Shuyun met on his behalf. When asked whether He would go to Hankou, Wang replied that it was not yet determined whether to go to Hankou or not, and said that the Central Government would resort to military force against Yan as a last resort. At that time, He may depart for the front, but it is not yet determined which of the Pinghan, Longhai, and Jinpu lines to go to. Therefore, the report that He will serve as the commander-in-chief of the Pinghan Line is not factual. (Exclusive Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e46">要聞P]Central and National Government Memorial Week <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: The Central Party Headquarters of the Chinese Nationalist Party held its 51st weekly memorial service for the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 AM on the 17th in the auditorium.  Approximately 600 people attended, including members of the Central Committee, representatives attending the National Training Conference, officials from various ministries and departments, and guests. After Chairman Ma Chao-chun led the ceremony, Chen Guofu delivered a political report.  He comprehensively explained the main points and significance of the resolutions passed at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, including (1) the proposal to promote Party affairs work, (2) the proposal to train Party members, (3) the plan to train Party members during the period of political tutelage, (4) the plan to train the masses during the period of political tutelage, and (5) the proposal to integrate military political training into the special Party headquarters for the military. He encouraged the representatives attending the Training Conference to pay special attention to these resolutions and use them as a basis for discussing training plans. He also stated that Party affairs work should be carried out based on the plans established by the Third Plenary Session and that the effectiveness of the work lies not only in verbal propaganda but also in practical efforts. Difficulties should not lead to negligence, nor should progress be delayed until economic conditions improve. Ways to compensate for economic shortcomings must be found, or economic development must be pursued, so that the people can truly benefit in their lives.  This is essential for promoting Party affairs and building politics, he said. The ceremony concluded at 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>National Government: At 10:00 AM on the same day, the National Government held its weekly memorial service for the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen.  Those in attendance included Chiang Kai-shek, Tan Yankai, Zhu Peide, He Yingqin, Gu Yingfen, He Yaozu, Shao Yuanchong, Liu Jiwen, Chen Shaokuan, Yi Peiji, Zheng Hongnian, as well as heads of various ministries and departments under the National Government, directors, and officials from the civil affairs and military affairs departments, totaling more than 300 people. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the ceremony, he delivered the following report: "Fellow comrades, the political changes of the past week are of great significance, and I am reporting on them today. On the 8th of this month, Yan Xishan secretly allowed Feng Yuxiang to return to Tongguan. At that time, I telegraphed Director Zhao to inquire about the matter. Zhao replied that on the afternoon of the 8th, Yan Xishan visited Feng Yuxiang, but Feng declined to see him due to illness and left without saying goodbye in the evening. Now that he has fled, there is no way to stop him. According to people from the Northwest Army, on the evening of the 7th, Yan Xishan knelt before Feng Yuxiang and pleaded, 'The officials and soldiers of Shanxi and the Third Group Army all depend on you, brother. Only you can save Shanxi and the officers and soldiers of the Third Group Army. We will do whatever you say.' Thus, Feng Yuxiang left Taiyuan the next day. We are still not clear about the inside story of this matter. However, we can see from this that Yan Xishan knows that</p>
<p>Page 9</p>
<p>[Continued from News] he has no way out and has completely lost credibility nationwide. No one on the revolutionary side can trust him anymore. He tricked Feng Yuxiang into creating chaos for the Central Government. Because his own strength was insufficient, he wanted Feng Yuxiang to create chaos on his behalf. As a result, Yan Xishan has lost everything in the history of the revolution and on the revolutionary front. We previously hoped that Yan Xishan could go abroad to increase his knowledge and change his perspective so that he could return to China in the future and be entrusted with some responsibilities for the country. Now, looking at his actions, he is indeed a treacherous and cunning feudal warlord. He believes that feudal ideology can still exist. In fact, his actions have already bankrupted his political life. In the future, he will no longer be able to muddle through the revolution as he did before 1918. Now, Yan Xishan is also creating a great stir in the North, saying that the Central Army is concentrating in Cangzhou and Zhangde on the 15th to directly attack Hebei. So he is not going abroad after all. This is truly a joke. How can there be such a thing? We know that Dezhou is very close to Tianjin, only a few hours away. The last time the Jin Army arbitrarily moved troops to Dezhou, the Central Army was immediately ordered to retreat, and no soldiers were subsequently sent there. Furthermore, the Central Army has never crossed the Yellow River this time. In this way, it is obvious who wants peace and who is undermining peace. Now he is saying again that the Central Government is sending troops to attack him. This is again a complete fabrication of facts. Now, I hope that all comrades and fellow citizens nationwide will quickly prepare. I believe that the union of these reactionaries is infinitely optimistic for the future of the revolution, because the revolution cannot succeed if the reactionaries do not unite. Therefore, the greater the reactionary forces, the faster they will be eliminated. Now, the government is truly confident in eliminating the reactionaries and taking control of the overall situation. We are not just talking big. You can believe it. Therefore, we are deeply afraid that the reactionaries will not unite and that their reaction will not be obvious. I have heard that the Northwest Army issued a rebellious telegram on the 15th and, under the command of their Commander-in-Chief of the Republic of China Army, Yan Xishan, and Deputy Commander-in-Chief, Feng Yuxiang, are concentrating their forces and leaving Tongguan to attack us. However, the Central Government's policy is always peace, with a very firm will and a very stable attitude. We will wait until the reactionary forces are completely exposed and it is impossible not to use force before we rise up to eliminate them. Therefore, the Central Government is currently taking a defensive position, waiting for the people to know that their rebellion is obvious, and then the Central Government will launch a campaign to suppress them. They will not be able to resist. I deeply hope that all fellow citizens and comrades know that the Central Government absolutely hopes for peace, absolutely takes a defensive position, not only not attacking them but also retreating to maintain the initial intention of peace, waiting for the rebel army to attack before engaging in a decisive battle to achieve our goal of removing obstacles and completing the revolution." The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<p>The 79th Regular Meeting of the Central Committee: The 79th regular meeting of the Central Committee was held on the afternoon of the 17th. Hu Hanmin, Ye Chucang, Tan Yankai, Sun Ke, Chen Guofu attended.

(2) As Committee Member Ye Chucang has been newly appointed as the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and cannot be in Nanjing often, Deputy Minister Liu Luyin will be allowed to act as the head of the Propaganda Department. (3) Committee Member Dai Chuanxian submitted a request to resign from the position of Minister of Training, stating that his old illness was recurring and he was unable to concentrate his spirit. It was resolved to persuade him to stay. (4) Regarding the suggestion from the Jiangsu Provincial Party Rectification Committee submitted by the Third Plenary Session, it was requested that matters that have been resolved to be completed within a limited time must be completed within that time; otherwise, they should be punished. It was resolved to send the proposal to the Supervisory Committee.</p>

<p>Reasons for Chen Naiyuan and Others' Delayed Arrival in Fuzhou: Yang Shuzhuang Enters Beijing to Seek Instructions. Fuzhou Correspondence: The three members of the Provincial Government Committee, Cheng Shih-kuei, Hsu Hsien-shih, and Wu Shu, Director of the Water Police Bureau, who were detained in Yenping, arrived in the province at 5:00 PM on the 10th. The three members of the Provincial Government Committee, Chen Nai-yuan, Cheng Pao-ching, and Lin Chih-yuan, who were detained in Yuci, were originally scheduled to arrive in the province at 7:00 AM on the 11th. Family members and representatives from various departments gathered at the Hungshan Bridge to wait for them, but as of the afternoon of the 12th, there was still no sign of Chen and the others. Moreover, these three individuals had closer ties to the Min (Fujian) Bureau than Cheng, Hsu, and Wu, and the location of Yuci was more dangerous than Yenping. Therefore, on the 11th and 12th, various speculations and rumors arose in society. After investigation, it was found that Chen and the others were sent from Yuci County to Yuci Estuary on the afternoon of the 10th, but due to strong winds upstream on the Min River, boat traffic was difficult. It was not until 5:00 PM on the 12th that the Zhenxing steamboat, specially prepared by Lu's department, transported them to the province. They arrived at Hungshan Bridge at 2:00 AM on the 13th and were sent to the old ordnance factory in Huangdian, where they resided with Cheng Shih-kuei and the others. Yang Shuzhuang in Majiang was notified by telephone, and he awaited instructions from the central government. At 10:00 AM this morning, Yang Shuzhuang traveled to Beijing on the Puan transport ship from Majiang. Those accompanying him included Shen Guansheng, Secretary of the Minister of the Navy, Wu Shan, Secretary-General of the Navy Headquarters, and Chiang Chih-chuang, Adjutant-General. Before leaving, he also summoned Chen Chi-liang, Commander of the First Fleet of the Navy, and Chen Pei-kun, Member of the Provincial Government, for discussions. How to settle the five provincial committee members, Chen, Cheng, Hsu, Zheng, and Lin, and how to deal with the three generals, Lin, Lu, and Sa, all depends on Yang's arrival in Beijing to meet with Chairman Chiang before a decision can be made. However, according to political circles today, Yang's conversation with Chen Chi-liang and Chen Pei-kun before his departure concerned the reorganization of the Navy Headquarters into the General Command of the Marine Corps stationed in Fujian, with Chen Chi-liang as the General Commander, and the reorganization of the Provincial Defense Command into the Provincial Garrison Command, with Lin Shou-kuo as the Commander. However, this also depends on Yang's reaching Beijing and consulting with the National Government and the Ministry of the Navy before a decision can be announced. (March 14)</p>
<p>Ganzhou's Anfu County Sacked by Bandits: The County Magistrate and Bureau Director Killed, Thousands Dead. Report by the Brigade Commander: County Seat Recaptured on the 12th. Nanchang Communication on the 14th: Anfu in Western Jiangxi, located between Ji'an, Yongxin, and Lianhua Gorges, is mountainous and has long been a region frequented by bandits and communists. This time, Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, Yuan, and Wang's bandit gangs, failing to capture Ji'shui and Ji'an, then harassed Anfu via the Gorge between Ji'an. County Magistrate Ji Gongquan, believing that the county government had two machine guns and a water and drought contingency response team, hundreds of guards and rural clearing squad members, decided to close the city gates and defend it firmly when the bandit communists attacked. Initially, he repelled Peng and Huang's bandit gangs and remained safe. The Civil Affairs Department commended his bravery and resourcefulness, and Magistrate Ji became even more motivated. However, Peng's bandits and part of Zhu's bandits, totaling about 2,000-3,000 men, re-besieged the county seat at the beginning of this month. Magistrate Ji still closed the city and resisted the enemy. After several days and nights of fierce fighting, the 148th Brigade of Ji'an heard the alarm and sent the Huang regiment to assist. However, due to the long and difficult road, they could not arrive in time. The county seat was eventually captured by the communist bandits due to a lack of ammunition and reinforcements. County Magistrate Ji Gongquan, Inspector Xiong, Public Security Bureau Director Zou, Party Steering Committee Team Leader Wu, and Team Leader Liu were all hacked to death by the bandits. The bandits resented the citizens who helped the troops defend the city, killing anyone they encountered. Approximately 3,000 people were killed, truly a great catastrophe. Ji'an County Magistrate Peng Xueyou reported the tragic situation in Anfu in a telegram yesterday, stating, "After the fall of Anfu, there was a massive massacre. County Magistrate Ji, Inspector Xiong, Public Security Bureau Director Zhao, Steering Committee Member Zou, Guangfu, Team Leader Wu Naikui, Team Leader Liu Zhonghou, and the entire Zhou Bomo family were killed. Public group members were arrested. Deaths and captures amount to thousands. Details await investigation. The Guard Corps was completely disarmed. This catastrophe was caused by a lack of ammunition and reinforcements. Public sentiment is indignant and difficult to express. Please, Your Excellency, have pity on the disaster victims, allocate funds for relief, and order the defense forces to recapture the city quickly. Also, please quickly allocate guns and ammunition to restore the police force; otherwise, Anfu will never recover." Signed, Peng Xueyou, Ji'an County Magistrate. At the same time, a telegram was received from Cheng Guangyao, Brigade Commander of the 148th Brigade in Ji'an, stating that the city had been recaptured by the Huang Regiment. The telegram stated, "(1) I have just received a phone call from Huang Regiment Commander from Anfu, reporting that he made contact with the bandits at Guanqiao this afternoon at 3:00 PM, killing dozens of bandits. The bandits retreated towards Caihua. He recaptured Anfu at dusk and plans to continue pursuing them on New Year's Day. (2) County Magistrate Ji was killed. The people were not injured. Please, Commissioner, preside over county administration."</p>
<p>Trial of Yang Jingchun Bribery Case: Jinan Correspondence: The case of Yang Jingchun, Section Chief of the Ziyang County Government, bribing Ning Kun, Secretary-General of the Civil Affairs Department, to buy the position of county magistrate, which caused a sensation at the time, was sentenced by the Jinan District Court to three months' imprisonment for Yang Jingchun. Wang Shihao, Director of the Shanghe County Public Security Bureau, who introduced Yang for bribery, was found not guilty. The District Court Prosecutor appealed to the Shandong High Court. Today (the 14th) at 2:00 PM, the High Court held a hearing in Criminal Court One. Those present were Zhao Zhiwu, Criminal Court President; Judges Li Faxian and Pan Huaiguo; Prosecutor Li Qinhe; Clerk Sun Youquan; and Hao Fengcheng, the lawyer hired by Wang Shihao. The Court President first asked Yang Jingchun about his background. Yang replied that he was from Shaanxi and was originally the First Section Chief of the Ziyang County Government. He arrived in the county in May 1918. Asked when he came to Ji'nan, what he came to Ji'nan for, and where he lived, he replied that he came to Ji'nan in July because he passed the county magistrate examination in 1916 and was recommended to Ji'nan by the Ziyang County Magistrate last year. He lives in the Xinhua Company. Asked why he met with Director Zhu of the Civil Affairs Department, he replied that he had met with Chairman Chen after coming to Ji'nan, and Chairman Chen asked the Civil Affairs Department to keep his name on file as a county magistrate, so he went to see Director Zhu. Asked if he later met with Ning Kun, Secretary-General of the Civil Affairs Department, and whether he asked to be given a position, he replied that there was such a thing. Asked if it was true that he wrote a letter to Secretary Ning to offer a bribe, he replied that although he had written a letter to Ning before, it was not necessarily written by him. Asked if the receipt in the letter was written by him, he replied that he had admitted it before. Asked if Wang Shihao gave him the idea to buy a county position, he should tell the truth, he replied that he originally had a brain disease and felt extremely difficult after coming to Ji'nan. At this time, he received a letter from his father, saying that there was a major drought in his hometown in Shaanxi. Asked if he wanted to bribe to buy a county position because of this, so he wrote the letter, he replied that his brain was temporarily confused and he did not know what he was writing. Asked what Secretary Ning said to him when he met Secretary Ning, he replied that he did not remember clearly. Asked if Ning taught him to prepare, and he did not understand what it meant, and he asked Wang Shihao, and Wang said that preparing meant preparing money, and he said one thousand yuan, and Wang said it was too little, it must be three thousand, he replied that he did not know. Asked why he did not offer three thousand or two thousand, but offered two thousand seven hundred, he replied that he did not have so much money. Asked if he had no money, then he could not write a withdrawal slip. If he encountered a greedy person who was not willing to report it like Secretary Ning and gave him a position, asked what he would do if he wanted money, he replied that if he had two thousand seven hundred yuan, he would definitely not come to the province to suffer. At that time, he went to the Bank of Communications and could not withdraw the money, which proved that he had no money. Asked if he had admitted in the District Court and the Civil Affairs Department that he had written this letter, and he could not say that he had not offered a bribe just because he had not withdrawn the money from the Bank of Communications, and now his original letter was here, with his business card and withdrawal slip attached, which could be used as ironclad evidence, so he took the letter and showed it to Yang. Yang said that this letter was not necessarily his letter. Asked if the facts were all there and could not be overturned, and when he and Jia Ziyu sold opium, he had admitted it when the Provincial Government Committee asked him, Yang sighed deeply. Asked if the facts of bribery and opium selling were all there, and if he admitted it, he could still be forgiven, but he absolutely could not if he did not admit it, he replied that he had only been in Ziyang County for more than a month, and he really had no money. Because he received a letter from his father saying that his hometown was in chaos, his brain was greatly stimulated, and he heard people say that there were officials selling positions, so he was willing to come to the province and sacrifice his personal future. Asked if this was inconsistent with the facts, he should go down, and Yang left the court. Then Wang Shihao was summoned. The court asked Wang about his background. Wang replied that he was twenty-nine years old, from Hengyang County, Hunan, and came to work in the Secretary's Office of the Civil Affairs Department last March, introduced by Secretary Ning. Asked where Secretary Ning was from, he replied that he was also from Hengyang. Asked when he met Yang Jingchun, Wang replied that it was in July last year. The first time, Yang asked him to speak well of Secretary Ning, and the second time, Yang asked him if he had seen the Secretary, and he replied that he had not seen him for many days. The third time, Yang saw him and said that he was having difficulties in the province, and he said that Secretary Ning did not tell you to go back? Asked if Secretary Ning told him to prepare, and he did not understand, and he said that preparing meant preparing money, and later he wrote a letter to Secretary Ning, saying that he had entrusted someone to express his sincerity, and that person was him. Wang replied that he did not know what his motive was for writing this letter. Asked if he entrusted him to engage in monetary activities, he replied no. Asked if there was none, why did Yang have a letter of bribery, he replied that he did not know. Asked why he only repeatedly looked for him when there were so many people in the Civil Affairs Department, and whether he entrusted him to engage in monetary activities, he replied no, and the dignified Secretary would never openly ask for money in public. Asked if preparing was not necessarily wanting money, or perhaps others had misinterpreted it, Wang replied that he did not know. At this point, Wang was ordered to step down. Then Yang and Wang were summoned to the court together, and Hao Fengcheng, Wang Shihao's defense lawyer, was ordered to express his opinion. Hao started speaking, saying that in this case, the lawyer would express his opinion on Wang Shihao's part. The original trial found Wang Shihao not guilty, which was not inappropriate, because the prosecutor's appeal was based on Article 44, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, and Wang Shihao was suspected of helping others commit crimes. But even if Yang Jingchun's bribery was true, Wang Shihao had already gone to Shanghe to take office as the Director of the Public Security Bureau when Yang was bribing. Shanghe was far from Ji'nan, and he could not help Zheng Jingchun bribe. The prosecutor's reasons for appealing were nothing more than three: (1) Secretary Ning told Yang to prepare, and Yang did not understand, so Wang Shihao explained it for him. Regardless, the dignified Secretary of the Civil Affairs Department cannot solicit bribes in public. Even if there was one, no one saw Wang Shihao explain the word "prepare." If it was only based on Yang Jingchun's confession in the Provincial Government, it would be inappropriate, because the court must base its decision on its own investigation. Moreover, Yang did not admit this confession later. (2) Because Yang entrusted Wang to speak well of him, regardless, Wang did not speak well of him.</p>
<p>Page 10</p>
<p>It is also a common human emotion. Moreover, it was still far from the time of bribery, and it cannot be asserted that he helped with bribery. (3) There was a phrase in Yang's letter to Secretary Ning that said "entrust someone to express my sincerity," and "someone" did not necessarily refer to Wang. Even if it did refer to Wang, Wang was no longer in Ji'nan at this time. And examining the full text of the letter, there was a phrase "from beginning to end, I have not received a proper introduction," and it also said that "I entrusted someone to express my sincerity but received no reply," which proved that Wang did not introduce Yang. If he had introduced him, there would have been no reason not to reply. The prosecutor filed a lawsuit according to Article 44, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, but the reason was not valid. Please, Your Honor, uphold the original judgment and declare Wang Shihao not guilty. The court then asked the prosecutor to express his opinion. Prosecutor Li Qinhe stood up and said that the prosecutor's reasons for appealing were (1) that Yang Jingchun's original sentence was too light; (2) that Wang Shihao was suspected of helping with bribery and could not be found not guilty. Moreover, Wang's assistance with bribery and Yang's selling of opium had both been confessed by Yang before. Please, Your Honor, make a judgment according to the law. The clerk then read out the confessions of Yang and Wang, and the two of them signed them. The court then asked Yang if he had anything else to say. Yang replied that in short (1) he wrote the letter because he was stimulated; (2) he did not offer a bribe. Then Wang was asked if he had anything to say. Wang replied that he had a clear conscience about this matter, and today Yang had not confessed that he helped him bribe, which proved that he still had a conscience. The court then announced that the debate in this case was over and scheduled a date for sentencing. Yang Jingchun was remanded in custody, and Wang Shihao was released on his original bail, and then left the court.</p>
<p>A Brief Account of Liang Zhongjia's Life and His Family: Liang Died After More Than Ten Years in Office Without Accumulating Any Property, and His Family Still Does Not Know About His Death. Harbin Correspondence on the 10th: At 6:00 PM tonight, I went to Liang Zhongjia's residence at No. 4 Jilin Street to inquire about the situation of his family and Liang's life. I met Liang's relative, Mr. Chang, who told me, "Liang's courtesy name was Zixin, and he was 43 years old this year. His ancestral home was Lishu County, Liaoning, and he later moved to Zhengjiatun (Taonan). His family is very large, with close relatives numbering in the thousands. When Liang was young, his family was very poor. He was the second of five brothers. Liang was fond of martial arts and diligent in his studies since childhood. As a child, he often compared himself to Han Xin. His father admired his ambition and gave him special care in his education. At the age of 20, he worked in the border defense camp in Zhengjiatun, and all his monthly income was used to support his father and to encourage his fourth and fifth brothers to attend school. When Liang was in the border defense camp, all his actions were better than his peers, so he was valued by his superiors. In the second year of the Qing Dynasty's Xuantong period, Fengtian recommended students to the Beiyang Military Academy, and Liang was among them. After two years of study, Wu Junsheng was serving as the commander of the Second Cavalry Brigade of the Central Army, so he appointed Liang as the major adjutant of the Third Regiment of that brigade. He was 26 years old at the time. Later, he was repeatedly promoted due to his merits, but he always stayed by Wu's side. In the third year of the Republic of China, Wu Junsheng served as the Zhenshou Envoy of Taoliao, and Liang was appointed as the second-class staff officer of that office. In the sixth year, the Second Cavalry Brigade of the Central Army was merged with the Fengtian Rear Route Patrol Camp and reorganized into the Twenty-ninth Division. Wu served as the division commander, and Liang served as the artillery battalion commander. In the tenth year, he was promoted to the commander of the Fourteenth Regiment of the Fifty-first Brigade of the Border Defense Army. In the twelfth year, the commander of the Fifth Cavalry Brigade of the Black Army, Shi Deshan, died of illness, and Liang was promoted to the commander of the Fifth Brigade. In the thirteenth year, Wu Junsheng served as the Black Governor, and Liang served as the commander of the Fifteenth Brigade and the commander of the Harbin-Manchuria Railway Protection Army, as well as the commander of the Manzhouli Garrison. During the Second Zhili-Fengtian War in the twelfth year, Liang served as the commander of the Fifth Brigade and followed Wu Junsheng to attack Xifengkou. The Fifth Brigade was at the forefront, and all battles were victorious, so Wu Junsheng relied on him. In the fourteenth year, during Guo Songling's rebellion, Wu Junsheng led Liang's brigade to aid Fengtian and intercepted Guo's army at Xinmin. The Fifth Brigade was trapped, and Liang resisted desperately, and finally reinforcements arrived, defeating Guo's army. Last year, when the Sino-Russian incident occurred, Liang defended against 40,000 Red Army troops with his lone army for half a year. The general public began to pay attention to him. Since Liang took office, he has always been committed to integrity and self-restraint. He donated funds to establish the Manzhouli Ordnance Factory of the Fifth Brigade. His family has not added an acre of land or built a house. Liang's father is still alive (still living in his hometown). His eldest brother, Zhongyong, works for the Feng-Hai Railway. His second brother died early. His fourth brother, Zhonglu, manages the family affairs. His fifth brother, Zhongwu, is currently serving as an adjutant in a certain army corps in Liaoning. Liang's family moved from Manzhouli to Harbin last year and resided at No. 4 Jilin Street. He has five sons and one daughter. The eldest, Kunshan, is 18 years old and attends the Second Secondary School of the Special Region. The second, Baoshan, is 12 years old. The third, Junshan, is 8 years old. All are studying in a certain elementary school. The fourth, Xizi, is 5 years old. The youngest son, Wufu, is 2 years old. The daughter, Shudong, is 16 years old and learns needlework at home. She has been betrothed to Zhao Zhongren, the head of the Hailar Municipal Preparatory Office. Liang has no concubines besides his wife. His family gathers together and is harmonious and happy. When I went to inquire, his family only knew that Liang was seriously ill and did not know that he was dead. His grandmother and aunt also lived in the Harbin residence. His grandmother is over 80 years old and misses him all day, hoping to see him. Because Liang has been guarding the Manchurian border since last year, it has been half a year. His family has been away for a long time. I expect that when the bad news arrives, they will cry non-stop.</p>
<p>Local Correspondence: Songjiang. A Committee Meeting for the Reorganization of Police Fees in District One: The District One Committee for the Reorganization of Housing and Police Fees in this county held a regular meeting at the District Office on the 18th. The following matters were resolved: The committee's charter was revised and passed. The county government ordered that a subsidy be allocated from the housing police donation to Weng Shuming, the substitute member of the County Public Security Bureau. It was resolved that the district police funds were in urgent need, and the candidate members dispatched by the provincial government should be subsidized by the Public Security Bureau. The issue of police salaries at the South Gate was also resolved. The salaries of the police at the East and West Gates are paid by the Public Security Bureau. The police at the South Gate, who serve the same function, should be treated the same as those at the East and West Gates. The police force at the branch offices in the four districts of this city is weak. Residents in each district have requested additional personnel, and the request is very strong. There is indeed a need to add personnel. However, over the years, this has been impossible due to financial constraints. After reorganizing the housing police donations, there is a slight surplus, which should be used immediately. It was decided to add ten police officers, two in Districts One and Four and three in Districts Two and Three. Start-up funds will be raised by each district, and police salaries will be disbursed by the District Office according to the budgeted amount.</p>
<p>Last Year's Tax Surplus Carried Over to the New Tax: The Finance Bureau received a telegram from the Finance Department stating that the county's farmland and the silver tax for 1918 would still be collected according to the original plan, and the amount overpaid should be allowed to be carried over to the new tax for this year. The bureau issued a notice to this effect. The bureau requested instructions on this case, because the tax for the winter of 1918 had already been raised, while the silver tax had been collected earlier and could not be reduced. As a result it would be carried over to the new tax for 1919. The above was issued to make it known to all.</p>

Tang Aqi and others were each sentenced to two years of imprisonment.</p>

<p>It is said that etiquette and courtesy vary across time and geography, but grand ceremonies and gatherings have always emphasized neat, orderly attire and a dignified, solemn atmosphere, showcasing the splendor of the era. Only in our nation today have old customs been deemed outdated and abandoned, while new systems have yet to be established, causing the people to feel uncertain about proper decorum. Although dress codes were promulgated long ago, they have remained mere regulations of the government, with public servants not fully complying. It is difficult to convince the people to follow suit. Therefore, to uphold the dignity of the law and transform the people through moral influence, the implementation of formal attire should begin with government personnel leading by example. The silk weaving industry has suffered from the pressure of foreign goods in recent years. If each person were to have a set of blue robes and black jackets, it would greatly boost the silk weaving industry. Even without substantial loans, it may not be difficult to sustain. Considering this from the perspective of our nation’s remaining industries, it is imperative to promote formal attire made from domestic goods. From a personal economic perspective, the materials for formal attire are not limited to silk. Aside from wool, for which we lack domestic products, linen and cotton fabrics are all suitable, and the cost of a set should not be too high. It is proposed that all public servants, regardless of gender or season, wear formal attire made from domestic goods when attending celebrations, grand assemblies, first meetings with superiors, or the weddings and funerals of relatives and friends, as a means of promoting such attire. It is respectfully requested that the Governor issue an order to all bureaus within the government, requiring all personnel above the appointed rank to prepare their attire within a short period. Once all personnel within the government have complied, a public announcement should be made, requiring that guests and hosts alike wear formal attire made from domestic goods at weddings and funerals to show respect. It is also requested that a letter be sent to the Municipal Party Committee to jointly promote this initiative. This proposal was submitted by the Mayor and passed at the 151st Municipal Administration Meeting. The Municipal Government then sent a letter to the Municipal Party Committee to jointly promote this initiative and issued an order to all subordinate agencies to comply accordingly. It is said that the quality of the materials is of great importance, and the bureau is considering selecting several types of silk and cloth for use in formal attire. The shades of blue also vary, and the most appropriate shade is currently under study. It is planned to collect samples from silk and cloth manufacturers for selection.</p>
<p>Hu Shih-tse Returned to Beijing Yesterday After Passing Through Shanghai:</p>
<p>The Entire Sino-French-Vietnamese Treaty Has No Problems; The French Envoy Awaits Instructions Before Heading South</p>
<p>Hu Shih-tse, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was previously ordered to go to Peiping to negotiate and sign the Sino-French-Vietnamese commercial treaty. Mr. Hu arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin on the "Tianjin Maru" at 2:00 PM yesterday. He immediately took a car with the Foreign Minister to Beijing that evening. According to Mr. Hu, speaking to our newspaper reporter, the entire Vietnamese treaty has been properly settled. However, due to the recent change of cabinet in France, and because important members of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs are attending a meeting in London, the new cabinet does not wish to present difficult issues to the parliament for approval to avoid complications. Therefore, the Vietnamese treaty has been put on hold. The French envoy expressed to me that he would set off south to sign the treaty as soon as he received instructions from the French government. Currently, the French envoy has left Peiping for a tour of Liaoning.</p>

<p>Delegates Attending the Northeastern Provinces Memorial Service Depart Today</p>

<p>Concession Telephone Issues</p>
<p>The Two Municipal Councils Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Patent Rights and Other Issues</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council’s joint advisory committee is drafting improvement principles for the concession telephone system, since the conditions of the three bidders for the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company were not accepted. The three bidding companies will revise their bids accordingly for further discussion. It is now known that the two Municipal Councils resumed an informal discussion in the board room of the Shanghai Municipal Council at 4:00 PM yesterday. Those present were all board members of the two Municipal Councils and were not related to the advisory committee formed by the two Municipal Councils. According to Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, speaking to our reporter, the content of the meeting was quite complex and simple publication would have little meaning. The discussion concerned the financial issues of improving the concession telephone system. According to Mr. Jones, Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, after the Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company is reorganized into a new company, assuming its capital is ten million taels, the operating patent period for the contractor will vary in length. A longer patent period will mean lower costs for telephone users, and vice versa. For example, if the new company’s operating patent period is tentatively set at forty years, the various costs of improving the telephone system can be gradually recovered within forty years. If it is set at ten or twenty years, the same costs must be recovered within ten or twenty years. Therefore, for the sake of telephone users, a longer operating patent period for the new company is beneficial. The issue being discussed by the two Municipal Councils today is this. In addition, financial aspects must also be discussed.</p>

<p>Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine Community’s "March 17th Memorial Meeting":</p>
<p>Over a Thousand People Attended the Memorial</p>
<p>Last year, March 17th was the date of the "Anti-Abolition of Traditional Chinese Medicine Movement" in the Chinese medical community, when a national representative assembly was convened in Shanghai. Through the concerted efforts of the entire nation, the original proposal of the Health Conference was fundamentally denied. Subsequently, Chairman Chiang issued a clear directive to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education to rescind all laws and regulations restricting and hindering the development of traditional Chinese medicine. The National Federation of Traditional Chinese Medicine Associations was established at this time. The General Assembly decided that March 17th would be a memorial day, and memorial meetings would be held in various provinces, cities, counties, districts, and by overseas Chinese communities. Yesterday in Shanghai, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association, the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Shenzhou Chinese Medicine Associations of various districts, and other medical and pharmaceutical organizations jointly held a memorial meeting at the Chamber of Commerce. Over a thousand people attended. The meeting was adjourned at 1:30 PM, and Cai Jiping (medical community), Ding Zhongying (schools), Zhang Shisheng (pharmaceutical industry), Xue Wenyuan (charitable organizations), and Zhang Zanchen (medical newspaper) were elected as the presidium, with Xia Chongguang as the master of ceremonies and Cheng Diren and Chen Cunren as the recorders. The ceremony was conducted as prescribed. Jiang Wenfang reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that March 17th was a memorial day for the national medical community to receive a major stimulus and unanimously resist oppression. A year has passed in the blink of an eye, and the construction plan is being prepared by the General Federation. Holding this grand meeting today is truly an optimistic sign. Next, Jiang Jizi from the Sixth District Party Department gave a speech, stating that there should be no distinction between Chinese and Western medicine in our country, and Chinese medicine should maintain its leading position and be called national medicine, in order to resist the academic invasion of imperialism, seek self-preservation, and improve itself. Currently, 30-40% of Japanese medical techniques were originally Chinese medical techniques, and they have established the Imperial Chinese Medical Research Association, which tests Chinese medicines and confirms their therapeutic effects that Western medicines cannot achieve. Therefore, the Japanese are very enthusiastic about studying Chinese medicine. If the Chinese want to destroy Chinese medicine, is this not a policy of self-destruction? I believe there is no reason to destroy Chinese medicine, but rather a need to promote it. Next, Mr. Ye Huijun gave a speech, first stating that national medicine is the only health guarantee for the Chinese nation, and then述 the origins of the March 17th memorial. He then述 the hope that the medical community would forever uphold the spirit of March 17th last year and continue to struggle to the end, and that the annual March 17th memorial would continue forever. Finally述 that the national medical community must always pay attention to improvement during the struggle, especially to advocate practicality and start from practical aspects. Next, Mr. Zhu Weiju, from the medical community, gave a speech, briefly stating the united situation and feelings of March 17th last year, and述 the value of the March 17th memorial, hoping to never forget the enthusiasm of all sectors for their unanimous assistance on March 17th last year, and the response of the health authorities. He did not述 hope that all medical colleagues would from now on assume the responsibility of rushing forward on the road to light. Then, all the students of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Specialized School performed the new play "Conscience," and the Student Union and Wang Ziping performed martial arts, and all the students of the Chinese Medical College performed the new play "Mandarin Duck Robbery," and other recreational activities, all of which were very exciting, to entertain the guests. Until the clock struck seven, the photography was disbanded.</p>

<p>The Concession Police Request the Death Penalty in the Case of Two Brothers Killing Their Stepmother</p>
<p>The Death of the Deceased Was Extremely Tragic; The Accused Cannot Be Tolerated by Society; The Police Lawyer Asks for Strict Punishment; The Debate Will Reopen Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>Zhang Wenqing, the daughter of the late official Zhang Fusheng of Huzhou, who is of marriageable age but has not yet married, colluded with her lover Chen Hengcai and others to kill her stepmother, Zhang Su. The case was discovered and arrested by the police. This newspaper has reported on the interrogation and other matters by Judge Wei Renji of the Provisional Court in the Fifth Court. Yesterday afternoon, the debate was opened to the public, and the audience was still very crowded. However, the witness Gao Ma, who was additionally summoned, could not be summoned because her address was unknown. The attorney representing the deceased's family stated that the charges against Zhang Wenqing's sister, Zhang Wenpei, and brother-in-law, Yin Rongyuan, were withdrawn, but the part of the property that had been taken away was still requested to be retained. Judge Luo then ordered the debate to begin.</p>
<p>Statement by the Police Lawyer</p>
<p>First, the police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, gave a statement lasting more than an hour. His statement was roughly as follows: The police are prosecuting this case under Article 284 of the Criminal Code for premeditated murder. The first defendant, Zhang Wenqing, and the second defendant, Chen Hengcai, are instigators, and the third defendant, Yao Yonggui, and the fourth defendant, Gao Jintang, are the actual murderers. As for the details of the case, after several investigations, it has become clear that there is no doubt. Zhang Wenqing's father, Zhang Fusheng, married one wife and one concubine. The wife gave birth to two daughters, the eldest being the defendant and the second named Wenpei. The concubine, the deceased, also gave birth to two sons, named Wenquan and Wenjie. After Zhang Fusheng's death, the estate of over 27,000 yuan was originally managed by the wife, Mrs. Su. The said Mrs. Su fell ill the year before last, and the family affairs were then managed by the concubine, Mrs. Su, and disputes arose. Although the case was settled in court through reconciliation, the suspicion was difficult to dispel. Chen Hengcai is the son of a servant of the Zhang family. The servant has now died in his hometown of Zhenjiang. Hengcai came to Shanghai in November of last year and lived in the Zhang family. On January 25th of this year, at 6:00 PM, Zhang's friends, Yao Yonggui and Gao Jintang, etc., entered through the back door of the Zhang family and stabbed Zhang Su with a knife. After the incident, Zhang Wenqing and the neighbor, Mrs. Wang Qian, sent the injured to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. The doctor found five stab wounds on the arms and other parts of the body, and she died on the 27th. At the time of the incident, there was a Chinese police post at No. 451 Carter Road near Zhang's house. Zhang Wenqing reported to the Chinese police that her house had been robbed and the homeowner had been injured. The police immediately reported to the police station, and the patrol sent a detective to the scene. By this time, the injured person had already been sent to the hospital, and the detective went to the hospital and questioned the injured person, only to find that Zhang Wenqing was highly suspicious, so she was arrested. She then confessed to Chen Hengcai. After Chen was arrested, he confessed that Yao and Gao were the murderers, and he went to Zhenjiang to arrest Yao and Gao. They all admitted knowing the details, so he filed charges against the four. The most important evidence in this case is the defendant's confession to the police and the court's testimony. Other than that, there is no evidence. During the first interrogation, Chen Hengcai fully admitted to the confession submitted by the police and said that Zhang had entrusted him to buy a handgun, but because he could not buy it, he changed to a knife and ordered Yao and Gao to do it, promising to pay a reward of 500 yuan, with a deposit of 20 yuan paid in advance. The deposit was paid in front of Xu Rentang on Xinzha Road, and at the same time, the murder weapon was given. Zhang Wenqing is not illiterate, and she personally read her confession at the time, only saying that there were two points in the confession that did not match, namely the phrases "nineteenth night" and "that night", and the rest were admitted. Zhang also said that she and Chen Hengcai met three times on Jing'an Temple Road and the Carter Road hot water shop, etc. Chen told her that he had hired Yao and Gao to kill the aunt, etc. When Judge Sun interrogated Yao and Gao on February 6, Yao admitted that he went with Gao and said that he could get 350 yuan after the event. The murder weapon was given to Gao by Zhang Wenqing before entering the house. According to this situation, Gao is indeed the murderer, but Gao's供 is full of cunning. However, after the deceased entered the hospital, the hospital staff heard the deceased say that the eldest young lady (i.e., Zhang Wenqing) knew very well about this matter. Based on various circumstances, it is nothing more than adultery and conspiracy to obtain property. Gao Jintang has no hatred with the deceased, so his purpose is only to obtain monetary reward after the murder. Yao Yonggui's purpose is also to obtain a reward of 350 yuan. However, Chen Hengcai has three points: (1) Because his mother was bullied, Zhang claimed that Chen wanted to avenge his mother, but it is feared that there is no such filial son in the world, and his mother has been dead for many years. If he wanted to avenge her, why didn't he report it earlier? (2) Even if he was avenging his mother, he would be a true filial son. Now that the great revenge has been avenged, it can be a happy event, and he must not involve the innocent Zhang Wenqing in the whirlpool. (3) Because Chen and the deceased discussed borrowing 1,500 yuan to open a bookstore, but Zhang objected and encouraged the deceased to refuse to borrow the money, causing Chen to resent and want to kill the deceased. This kind of statement is not reliable. If this were the case, Chen should resent Zhang Wenqing rather than the deceased. Therefore, Chen's purpose is also money, because after the deceased is killed, the management rights of her property will naturally be entrusted to Wenqing, and Chen can also share in the profits. Therefore, he instructed Yao and Gao to kill. As for Zhang Wenqing, her purpose is also money. Looking at her repeated confessions, they all involve lawsuits and the issue of dividing money. Now the police are prosecuting under Article 284 of the Criminal Code, which is indeed because it was premeditated. Premeditated murder is different from ordinary murder, so the punishment also varies. This case should be sentenced to death because the death of the deceased was extremely tragic, and she was a young and weak woman who was entered and killed by a strong man. According to this situation, the defendant does not need to exist in society. It is requested that all be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Argument by Zhang Wenqing's Lawyer</p>
<p>Zhang Wenqing's lawyers, Jiang Baoli and Yuan Hanyun, successively argued, stating that the only basis for the plaintiff's accusation that the defendant Zhang Wenqing is suspected of murder is the defendant's confession and the confessions of the co-defendants Chen, Yao, and others. Although the defendant has confessed, necessary evidence should still be investigated to see whether it is consistent with the facts. It can be seen that relying solely on a confession cannot be considered evidence of a crime. The confession must be freely given by the defendant and must be consistent with the facts before it can be adopted. Now, after detailed investigation of the confessions of Zhang, Chen, and others and the records of repeated court hearings, not only is there a great difference from the facts, but there are also many points of contradiction. How can it be rashly adopted as evidence of Zhang Wenqing's crime? Chen Encai's confession to the police stated that "I was in Zhang's house, and she entrusted me to remove the aunt, and after it was done, she would give me 500 yuan." However, this is obviously contradictory to the facts. For example, the confession stated that "When I lived in Zhang's house, Gao and Yao often came to visit, and I told them about the eldest young lady entrusting me to remove her stepmother." However, the confessions of Gao and Yao during the court hearing stated that they did not know anything about it beforehand until Chen invited us on the day of the incident. It can be seen that Chen did not tell Gao and Yao about it when he lived in Zhang's house. It can also be seen that Chen's statement is completely fictitious. After examining various circumstances of this case, Wenqing did not commit any crime, and she should be declared innocent. The lawyers representing the victim, Fan Ming, Wang Xiangu, and Wei Wenhan, successively stood up to argue. The arguments are omitted.</p>
<p>Error in Criminal Intent</p>
<p>Finally, the lawyer appointed to defend the defendant Yao Yonggui, Chao Kun, stood up and stated that according to Yao, he was actually invited to fight at the time, and he did not know about the murder, so he should only be responsible for fighting, which is actually an error in criminal intent, and he should be punished according to this crime.</p>
<p>Debate Will Continue Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>The appointed lawyers for the two defendants, Chen and Gao, did not arrive, so the debate in this case could not be concluded. Judge Luo then ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody separately and await rescheduling. The court was adjourned after the clock struck six.</p>
<p>A Disturbance Under the Extraterritorial Road Construction</p>
<p>Japanese Police Illegally Block Chinese Territory and Commit Assault; Workers Understand Justice and Reason Seriously and Negotiate</p>
<p>The right to govern the land on both sides of North Sichuan Road, which was built by foreigners beyond the boundary, originally belonged to Chinese territory. All houses, buildings, water, and electrical installations should be approved by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works before construction can begin. Recently, the landowner Li Jingmai, who owns land at the corner of North Sichuan Road and Changchun Road, has been building a seven-story co-op and a three-story foreign-style house at the north end of the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Doulean Road for some time. The construction is nearing completion. A few days ago, because the water pipes and electrical wires in one of the three-story houses had not been approved by the Chinese authorities, but were connected by the concession side, they were ordered to stop work by the Public Security Bureau of the Fifth District, Third Precinct in order to emphasize sovereignty. At around 9:30 yesterday morning, the police officer on duty at Changchun Road of the Public Security Bureau saw workers installing water pipes and immediately went to inspect them. Unexpectedly, they were stopped by a Western police officer from the Dessaway Road police station when they walked on the sidewalk. The Chinese police officer explained the situation, but it was ineffective, so he reported to the patrol leader and requested instructions from Director Qu.</p>
<p>Illegally Blocking Chinese Territory</p>
<p>At that time, the director had already received a report from Patrol Leader Cui of the Sixth Police Station in Lane 189, Changchun Road, stating that the rear doors of the seven-story and three-story foreign-style houses built by the owner Li Jingmai of Yuqingfang and near the Changchun Road intersection on North Sichuan Road were illegally blocked with wooden planks and pillars, cutting off traffic. Before long, he received news of the dispute between the Chinese police and the Western police, so he used the telephone to ask Director Yuan for instructions so that he could negotiate with the police station. Soon, Director Yuan sent Qu Sunyi, a staff member of the Second Section, to the scene to investigate, and after arriving at the First Police Station in the Fifth District, he went with Director Qu and the patrol officer. It was about 11:30 AM at that time.</p>
<p>Japanese Police Illegally Commit Assault</p>
<p>A group of Public Security Bureau personnel went via Changchun Road on Chinese territory. Unexpectedly, when they reached the sidewalk along the road, several Japanese police officers pushed and beat the Chinese police officers without asking the reason, committing assault and making rude gestures that were unreasonable. Fortunately, the Chinese police were prepared and retreated in order to avoid trouble. However, Section Member Qu, Patrol Officer Tang, and the police officers were beaten by the Japanese police and suffered minor injuries. Soon, the director negotiated with the police chief, who said that the Japanese police who committed the assault would be identified and punished, but because the power over the houses was in the hands of the Chinese authorities, he would not interfere. Director Qu then led the police through Yuqingfang Second Lane to the back of the seven-story foreign-style house and ordered the craftsmen to remove all the obstacles, one by one. The craftsmen also understood the importance of justice and immediately opened a road directly to North Sichuan Road. The disturbance was finally resolved around 1:00 PM. From today onwards, two more posts will be added to Changchun Road to maintain Chinese police power. On the one hand, serious negotiations will be conducted with the concession authorities based on reason.</p>

Foreign Li Sales Stagnated and Softened  Market Overview This year, because there were no foreign exchange transactions, the market atmosphere was stagnant and people were idle and motionless. The appetite of banks was weak, and the market was on the verge of collapse. It is predicted that there will be no recovery in the near future. As for the silver market, although it feels loose on the surface, in reality, peers rarely trust each other. Generally speaking, there is no ability to raise prices.

The situation seems to be still tending toward fatigue. The reason is that the current situation is full of troubles, sales have decreased, resulting in a sharp increase in inventory. According to the survey at the end of February, it has reached 125,800 packages, and American Indian cotton and the three-item yarn are again pushing the boat along. Looking back at the wind shape last year, I can't help but feel that it is making order.  At that time, it was the peak spring sales season, but the changes in current affairs caused passenger sales to stagnate. Transactions of one or two thousand packages a week cannot be called light, and at this time of spring sales, it is particularly unsatisfactory. Although the overseas market is now relatively flat, there are still few signs of development. The Northwest problem has recently become more complicated, and the future of actual sales is rarely optimistic, so the large amount of inventory may be difficult to eliminate in the short term. Furthermore, each factory, when business was smooth last year, added spinning waves. According to the investigation, the increase that can be transferred in Shanghai alone is more than 180,000 pieces. The increase rate of inland factories is similar, so the increase in the amount of production is a matter of course. Since production has increased and sales have progressed, and the inland increase in production is also enough to affect the local actual sales, how to make sales brisk and eliminate this huge amount of inventory is the important key to future progress.   There Are Many Bidders for Standard Yarn Opening in the pre-market market, due to changes in the current situation and chaotic hearts, retail investors threw out, and the market was tired. Each month fell by three nine towns to one tael and one qian. Although the actual needs in the afternoon were good, the popularity was still declining. Each month fell by four, five, six, or seven qian, but some profit-takers bought back. The total daily transaction statistics were 19,100 packages. The closing prices are listed on the left.

It is found that the statistics of each gang buying the whole day is 1,750 packages, and the progress in the same industry is 610 packages. The market is slightly tired. Among the passenger gangs, the Qingdao gang has the strongest appetite, estimating 390 packages. In addition, the mainland has 270 packages, Tianjin 155 packages, Sichuan 230 packages, Guangdong 135 packages, Fujian 80 packages, Qinhuangdao 85 packages, Niuzhuang 40 packages, Shantou 65 packages, Xiamen 150 packages, Jiangxi 30 packages, Yantai 35 packages, Wuhu 50 packages, and Xuzhou 30 packages. The Cotton Market Is Difficult to Share Honor and Disgrace  The cotton market is calm, the general trend is neither prosperous nor disgraced, but the foreign cotton market is stable, the spot cotton sales are sluggish, and the amount of appetite of each factory has stalled, but the attitude of the Han gang is tough, and they are still unwilling to relax. The situation in the cotton market is extremely complicated, it is said.   The Han Standard Is Calm Itself The Han Standard and Cloth opened. Following the foreign cotton, it was strong and rising. Each month rose by five fen to one qian two or three discs. The yarn price was not high, resulting in a rise or fall of five fen. The afternoon market was still tired, falling by one qian five fen. The total daily transaction statistics were 23,400 dan. The Han Standard closing prices are recorded below.

British and Indian Cotton Industry News Weekly  Bombay Last week, the market seemed to be active and trending upward. Although American cotton was soft at the beginning of the week, local market prices were very firm. The Bairoxi price was six rupees better than American cotton, because the statistical situation of Indian cotton was favorable to the long side, and exporters and local manufacturers needed more value. Those with spot goods on hand remained firm, and spot demand continued to be good, with a large number of transactions.   Liverpool Spot sales improved last week, and although futures were uncertain, the trend has been firm. American cotton trended upward at the weekend, and particularly outstanding. Egyptian cotton also showed a firm trend, but confidence was still lacking. Food   Rice and Cloth Gradually Turning to a Settled Trend   Zhabei Yesterday, more than thirty rice boats arrived at each gang, and the market sales were smooth and sluggish. Common gang white japonica and high grades have all turned to a settled trend. Northern tin and other japonica shops have a slightly greedy appetite, and the market is slightly better. There are also buyers who are sluggish, so the market surface still has a batch reduction on the goods. The whole day, the japonica price has a rise or fall of one jiao. The accumulation of goods under the Bo Dahe River is not strong, the digestion is active, and the price is announced to be stable. Yang Du and Xianchu are initially poor, then turn active, and the arrival of goods is very thin, and the hearts of the people are extremely stable, so it is not easy to continue to soften. Passenger port Xian retail sales are also light, because the quoted price of foreign rice is short, and Saigon small twist futures are quite soft in the morning, which affects the local Xian. Glutinous rice wine shops have a slightly refreshing appetite, but street sales are sluggish again, and prices are still stable.   South Shanghai The arrival of goods under the river is continuous, and sales are still possible. The high goods Northern Japonica Linshi buying atmosphere morning is lonely and afternoon is prosperous. Su Tong middle and lower Japonica has Chongtong Yong customers asking for prices, but the market limit is extremely strict, and at the beginning it inherited the sluggish leftover wind of the Zhabei side the previous day, so it feels slightly soft.

The Bo Early Rice suddenly became firm and strong, because the remaining goods in the river were selected and purchased by retail sales and became scarce. Moreover, there were not many boats arriving, and carriers sold the goods to recover the cost, so the market atmosphere turned from stagnant wood to firm and stable. Yang Duzi tip has several numbers open, and the market is flat. Only foreign rice is tight at the time of closing, so the opening of this Xian today will probably follow it to be good. There are yin Yuan Du passengers arriving, and sales are still light, and it is difficult to turn the situation temporarily.

According to the meaning of the passenger letter, because Cheng Cheng is expensive, the market will inevitably be increased, but the banks want to reduce the price, and the two sides are in opposite positions, and it is difficult to become a market for a while.

Yesterday, such as Qichang New Taikoo Osaka South Manchuria Railway and other stacks, a total of 15,000 to 16,000 dan of metal products arrived, such as American white iron, new iron, cigarette skin iron French nails, and new lead wire, all of which had 1,000 to 2,000 dan, and the old iron of foreign board heads foreign yuan heads and white lead wire was also said to be quite a lot.

<p>Reuters, Paris, 16th. The crucial talks between British and French representatives concerning the fate of the naval conference, hinged on this, were held at the British Prime Minister's villa today, lasting for four hours. The French Public Gazette only stated that both parties were striving to find a suitable method to ensure the success of the negotiations. French Prime Minister Tardieu and Foreign Minister Briand, upon returning to London from the British Prime Minister's villa, wore smiles. Tardieu then issued a statement saying, "I am confident that we will achieve satisfactory results." He also stated, "We believe that the results we seek are extremely important, and we will not allow any unwise haste." Tardieu further stated that he would return to Paris.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th. French Prime Minister Tardieu returned to Paris today and will return to London later this week to continue discussions on naval conference matters.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th. Although the stalemate between France and Italy showed no signs of easing after French Prime Minister Tardieu met separately with U.S. Chief Delegate Stimson and British Prime Minister MacDonald before departing for Paris, there was a slight glimmer of hope among those involved in the naval conference. It is rumored that the naval conference is currently considering a plan to allow France to agree to station the stipulated number of warships in the Mediterranean. Britain, having control of the Strait of Gibraltar, should be France's guarantor.</p>
<p>Dentsu, London, 16th. As a result of today's meeting between Britain and France, the French side stated that although they could not concede even a single ton on the 100,000-ton submarine proposal, if this proposal is compared with the Japanese quota in the American proposal, France has about twice as much. Furthermore, if France adheres to its original proposal for auxiliary ships, it is equivalent to France maintaining the status quo. According to the American proposal, Japan's auxiliary ship holdings are greater than France's. Also, Tardieu plans to return to Paris from London at 11:30 AM on the 17th and will come to London every weekend thereafter. Dentsu, Tokyo, 17th. Due to a partial concession by the United States, the negotiations between Japan and the United States have taken a slight turn for the better and are gradually reaching a crossroads of success or failure. It is rumored that the Japanese government's instructions, which can be issued today, will contain the following, including the three major principles of Japan's 70% demand, the so-called non-threatening military preparedness that is defensive rather than offensive, leaving no room for compromise. In particular, among the three major principles, Japan regards the 70% holding of eight-inch cruisers and the maintenance of the existing strength of 78,000 tons of submarines as the most important. Since it is not completely under consideration by the United States, greater efforts must be made in the future to implement the ultimate goal on this major principle.</p>

<p>Rivera Dies of Heart Failure The Republican Party's Anti-King Plan Suffers a Blow Reuters, Baffin, 16th. Former Spanish dictator General Rivera passed away in a hotel here today. Rivera had been suffering from diabetes for a long time and died suddenly due to heart failure. At the time, his children were attending Mass in a church. His body is now being preserved with embalming so that it can be transported back to the Spanish capital.</p>

<p>Reuters, Madrid, 17th. The death of General Rivera has greatly simplified the political situation. The Republican Party's most powerful network planned to investigate King Alfonso's involvement in the 1923 coup, when Rivera seized the opportunity to become dictator. If the investigation had been carried out, it was expected that Rivera would not have spared the King, as he hated the King for abruptly dismissing him after seven years of service. Now that Rivera is dead, the Republican Party's anti-King plan has suffered a blow.</p>

<p>Gandhi's Stirring Speech</p>
<p>Reuters, Ahmedabad, 17th. The Nationalist University, founded by Gandhi during his non-cooperation era, had been closed down to allow students to serve as volunteers for non-violent resistance. However, it has now been decided to reopen it, revise the curriculum, and actively train students in the principles and methods of non-violent resistance. Gandhi arrived in Boriavi today. Gandhi stated that from tomorrow onwards, the party members will rest every Sunday, and he himself will observe a day of silence on that day, not speaking at all. It is rumored that the Indian provinces will unanimously begin a non-violent resistance movement when Gandhi issues an order or is arrested. Gandhi will stay overnight in Anand village within the Kheda district of Bombay Province tonight and tomorrow. Gandhi addressed the crowd in Boriavi village today, saying that money alone cannot buy independence. If money could buy it, he would have already obtained it. Therefore, what is needed to exchange for independence is your blood. Gandhi also acknowledged that volunteers who refuse to pay salt tax cannot achieve independence. His action is merely intended to draw the attention of India and the world to other injustices upon which British imperialism is based.</p>

<p>Central Executive Committee Passes Three Motions</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 16th. The Soviet Russian Central Executive Committee recently passed three motions: (1) Stop using coercive methods to force landowners to join national cooperative farming movements; (2) Reopen all public trade markets; (3) Stop closing churches, except for priests and parishioners who volunteer, and do not ridicule those who believe in religion, with severe punishment for violators. The newspapers are now making every effort to explain that the government has not changed its policy, especially that there is no intention of abandoning individual economic policies. For example, Pravda stated that the first motion only intends to slow down the cooperative farming movement slightly, because the transportation of seeds cannot make expected progress, so the national cooperative farm movement has to be gradually implemented. As for the motion to stop closing churches, it is only aimed at some radical elements, because their actions are too enthusiastic, resulting in more harm than good. After all, Soviet Russia has never had the intention of vigorously abolishing religion, but some radical elements have been too hasty, causing international outrage, and so on. However, although the Russian newspapers say so, the general opinion is that it is quite similar to a reversal of previous policies.</p>

<p>Reuters, Riga, 16th. Soviet Russia began a special two-month propaganda campaign across the country yesterday against the celebration of Easter. The propaganda methods include anti-religious dramas, banquets, juggling, award competitions, field trips, lectures, etc., to entertain children and workers. The Anti-God Society hopes to recruit 100,000 new members.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th. Churches throughout England and Wales held gatherings today to pray for the Christian victims in Russia. Catholic churches are scheduled to hold similar prayer services on Wednesday. Military camps did not hold them due to government prohibitions. Some churches did not hold them because this type of prayer service formed anti-Russian propaganda. A delegation of British Jews met in London today and passed a motion opposing Russia's anti-religious policy, saying that it will wipe out Russian Judaism.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 17th.

<p>No Longer Asia but Switzerland, Claims US Narcotics Commissioner United Press, Washington, 16th. U.S. Narcotics Commissioner Anslinger claimed today that Asia is no longer the largest source of imported narcotics. Today, the world's largest source of narcotics has become the major factories in Switzerland, which specialize in manufacturing and supplying cocaine, heroin, morphine, and other narcotics. A significant amount of manufactured and unprocessed narcotics are smuggled into the U.S. from Turkey. The smuggling route is from the West Indies to Central American countries, and then by waterway to San Francisco and the Gulf Coast. The U.S. law enforcement agency confiscated narcotics worth US$2 million, awaiting destruction. However, organizations that specialize in smuggling narcotics have assets of tens of millions. How can a law enforcement agency with a budget of only 1.5 million resist them? It is like hitting a rock with an egg. Although the seizure of narcotics is often heard of, it is self-deceptive to say that smuggling can be cleared as a result.</p>

<p>Approximately 250 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 16th. The Ministry of Finance is investigating the Sumitomo family's assets in order to collect inheritance tax. The Sumitomo family is a major tycoon in Japan, second only to Mitsui and Mitsubishi. Their assets are spread throughout the country and are diverse. The valuation of assets such as mines is extremely difficult. Therefore, an accurate investigation of total assets is not easy. It has recently been assessed at approximately 250 million yuan. With an inheritance tax of ninety per thousand, it amounts to 22.5 million yuan. It has now been decided to pay it into the national treasury over five years. The Ministry of Finance, which is currently facing a shortage of funds, will use a portion of this large income to relieve unemployment expenses.</p>
