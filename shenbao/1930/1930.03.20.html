<h3>昨晚招待</h3>
<p>鈕主席以此次大會各裁判員及各報記者、極爲出力、特於昨（十九）晚、假教育廳設宴欵待、</p>
<h3>中華籌備參加逺東運動會</h3>
<p>籌募出發費八萬成績頗佳</p>
<p>日華僑及林珠光均願招待</p>
<p>審查運動新規則以便練習</p>
<p>全國運動閉幕後從事訓練</p>
<p>本届逺東大會、定於五月二十四日在日本東京舉行、我國各省各市莫不積極籌備、選拔英才、組成勁旅、預備與三島羣英及菲地好手、一見高下、故近日各處運動會之聲浪、震盡全國、蓬勃興奮、開我中華民國未有之盛况、實我國體育前途之好現象也、至籌備參加逺東大會情形、經過已數報端、今將最近籌備情形、探錄於後、</p>
<h3>經濟方面</h3>
<p>參加逺東運動會最重要問題、厥維經濟、負此重責之中華全國體育協進會、籌備之初、即注意及此、曾作一度精密之預算、爲數至少在八萬以上、雖經國民政府蔣主席慨助四萬元、（現已撥二萬元、交恊會主幹郝伯陽、）然缺數尚巨、故恊進會方面曾函電敦請國内偉人及海外僑胞之熱心體育者但任籌備、經濟董事分國内外各界人士捐募、以便集腋成裘襄斯盛舉、聞已得各處函復、成績頗佳、</p>
<h3>招待方面</h3>
<p>我國同胞之旅日經商者、爲數極多、每届逺東運動會在日本舉行時、莫不慷慨解囊組織規模宏大之招待會所、歡迎同胞選手隊、其愛國之熱忱誠使人欽感無己、本届大會又將在東京舉行、恊會方面已函請駐日大使汪榮寳氏以及東京神户大阪等處之中華會館担任招待事宜、聞在日僑胞中之富商大賈莫不慨然負責、現已組織招待委員會、預備届時作劇烈之歡迎云、</p>
<p>又聞小吕宋富商林珠光氏　亦是該會經濟董事重要之一、刻下正在海外指募大宗巨欵、以資挹注、按林氏於第七届大會在菲律濱開會、曾費去招待我華選手費達數萬之多、爲國增光、萬丈此番亦將盡量設法資助恊進會、襄斯盛舉、將於四日中返國、偕同選手赴日、</p>
<h3>規則方面</h3>
<p>逺東大會各項運動規則因潮流所趨、難免更改、故恊進會己函聘國内體育大家担任審查各項運動規則之是否合用、而作將來各選手練習時之標準、爲臨塲競賽時之準備</p>
<h3>訓練方面</h3>
<p>杭州全國運動會結束之日、即我中華逺東運動會代表產生之時、該時距大會開幕期日、尚存一月之多、大可使各選手作充分練習　故對於各選手在未出發以前之指導及管理二問題、非常出發以前之指導及管理二問題、非常重要、聞恊會當局刻正進行、尋租相當房屋以備選手住宿届時聘請學識深博經騐豐富之專門人才担任指導之責、對於管理事宜、則主張嚴格辦理、藉以養精蓄銳、以提國光</p>

<h3>一得之言</h3>
<p>— 維</p>
<p>如果世界上没有脂粉。至少要拯救出全世界之青年男女三分之一以上。</p>
<p>以男女兩情間用情之心。都放在救國救黨上面。則革命成功可立待。</p>
<p>如果女子絶對不會生產。則世界上的女權必高於一切。</p>
<p>男子看女子自上而下。女子看男子自下而上。</p>
<p>男子對新婚的妻子。似一襲新製的西裝。</p>
<p>等待情人約會的心。宛如火線的哨兵的心一樣。</p>
<p>處女的心是一張蛛網。男子是一隻蜻蜓。</p>
<p>倘情人在地上所走的足印。可以想法收藏。則必有人伏在地上一步一步的拾起。　　聽情人是音的耳覺。比聽螞蟻在地上爬行的聲音還子細。</p>
<p>男子以爲伊已被我作玩物。正如女子以爲他已被我作玩物一般。一樣彼此不知不覺地誰玩弄誰。而誰以爲誰是勝利者。</p>
<h3>誌體育家魏旭東</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>魏旭東先生。湘人也。初列戎行。以驍勇善戰名。旋解甲歸。笠屐游山水以爲樂。慕吳中虎阜靈巖之奇。不覺盤桓者多時。大有樂不思蜀之概。吳中最高學府東吳大學。及草橋中學。遂聘之授軍事學。兼體育教員。先生以出身行伍。識字不多。其授軍事學也。讀講義往往有别字。然說理殊暢達。經騐殊豐富。加之妙語如環。證引雋趣。不之病也。先生善鐵槓。槓上舉大鼎。一而再三。卒之身上下圜盪。鐵槓粗如兒臂。爲之屈曲。而先生不稍喘汗也。授兵式操。輒喜率隊至郊外。時遇大雨。生徒有畏縮欲躱避者。先生立斥之曰。男兒不先鍜鳏鍊軀體。將來何以爲國家干城。生徒聞言。爲之氣壯。抖擻精神。與雨師奮鬥。徧體沾濕。習以爲常。吳士素多懦弱。風俗因之丕變。先生又善射。星期之暇。常挾獵槍四出。禽雖高翔。先生發無不中。斜陽影裏。有斑鳩雉雀纍纍掛槍端者。則先生歸矣。先生又好控驢。當疾行如飛時。或一躍而下鞍。一任驢之脫覊逸走。然後再追踪之。驢方奔突。而先生已控坐於上矣。然驢力有所不勝。常以此而疲瘏。驢夫不之許。先生乃倍其酬值焉。一日。先生偕生徒作虎林之游。見捕蛇丐。先生以資以釋蛇。蛇行草萊間絶迅。先生又出資囑丐追之。旣獲再釋。釋而再追。先生以爲笑樂。其好弄有如此。一日有先徒挾箋對請國文教員某名宿書寫者。先生見之。奪之去。爲毛遂之自薦。生徒等莫不以爲箋對之無幸。塗鴉充字簏資料耳。不料先生濡墨揮毫。頃刻而就。筆勢崛挺。宛然北魏。生徒遂大驚服。蓋先生潛臨碑帖。功候已深。惟秘默不先宣示也。從此來書者日多。先生不暇應。乃定潤例以限止之。先生又任商團總司令者若干年。故雖婦孺亦無不知其大名。自予就食滬瀆。久不悉先生况狀。一昨學友王子慶來談。謂先生前因某事。大爲鬱怫。乃藉醇酒婦人以自遺。抱病歸湘。兹已物化矣。惜哉。</p>
<h3>劉章婚禮參觀記</h3>
<p>— 王梅璩</p>
<p>三月十六日耆宿章一山先生之女公子師伊女士。與名畫家劉海粟之介弟今美專教員劉海若君假五馬路中央大旅社行結婚禮。梅璩於一山先生有師事之心。而師仇女士之妹師昭。又曾問字於不佞。是以得往賀因參觀盛典焉。竊以今日之婚禮。純舊式者已不復見。文明式或半文明式時時而錯見。今劉章之婚。亦不能自外於文明。而蹌濟一堂。宜新宜舊一對璧人。尤爲盡美。故樂得而記之。</p>
<p>盡美之眞相　師仇女士。美專之高才生也。海若君聞與師仇由同學而爲師生。更由師生而爲伉儷。此盡美之源也。海若雄姿英發。絶無世俗輕薄子弟之狀。師仇則端莊流麗。與海若駢肩行禮。從容不迫。而剛健婀娜。相映成彩。謂非盡美之眞相乎。</p>
<p>夫人之知禮　章夫人兒女成行。佐一山先生襄理家政教育諸子。久有令譽。是日因一山先生小極初痊。未能躬親訓禮。夫人於來賓前陳述歉謝措詞謙畏。聞者動容。我女弟子師昭。躑躅往來。無事不審愼料量。孝友之忱。溢於眉宇。有如是之父母。宜其有是女也。</p>
<p>來賓之色采　是日男女來賓。五光十色。蓋一山先生。耆宿也。故有齒德皆尊之碩彥。師仇女士。美專高才生也。故有冠履特異之青年。男賢中如余公肇康年最高。杖履而來。鬚眉間隱隱有道氣。屈先生文六則又民國之有名人。特以鄉誼而至者。女賓多舊家庭人物。笑語之中。咸有彬彬之致。惜梅璩不新不舊。羼於其間。不免顏汗。</p>
<p>賓筵之趣語　六時入席。女賓在東隅。男賓西列。客有笑者曰。女界蓋不止與男界平權。語已趣甚。少頃。兩新人翩　而來。按席進酒。皆承命而飲。無敢違者。西第二席。似爲海若之同學。海若尋又一人者。向此席周旋。座中一客。强海若拇戰。海若辭。請客作代表。客曰。指戰而可代也。君今日之種種。亦可由我代乎。皆大笑。而海若竟不敢復辭。趣哉斯語也。</p>
<p>少見之多怪　喜幛有用「宜其州家」四字者。問於人皆謝不知。問師昭。師昭曰。金字有匣。匣上大書如此也。迨將入席。梅璩終爲此四字如骨鯁之在喉。趨而欲問王氏及門粲然允中冀獲有所得。而二惠方招待女賓。不果問。海内不乏鴻博。必笑我少見而多怪也。</p>
<h3>騙術新談</h3>
<p>— 政</p>
<p>上海地方。因爲五方雜處。所以離奇的事情也特别來得多最近我的朋友遇到一件騙案。也着實有些趣味。寫出來給諸君看看。也可以免得上當啦。</p>
<p>一天的晚上。朋友Ｃ君正坐在書室裏。突然來了一個中年男子。衣冠楚楚。不類下流中人。而且執禮狠恭。Ｃ君雖因不相識而有些驚異。但不得不和他寒暄幾句。聽他的口音。分明是同鄉。他也承認住在和Ｃ君家裏不逺的地方。並且說。他出外已多年了。在從前一直到現在都在軍隊中過生活。此刻在某軍長手下做營長。不久就要去了。從前在南方的時候。和Ｃ君的父親最熟識。並且把Ｃ君父親的當時情形。家庭情形。甚至于個性一一說出來。Ｃ君以爲是父親的老友。當然不敢怠慢。竭誠招待。那知談到後來。忽然拿出兩張當票。一張七元的。一張十三元的。說。現在因爲留滬日久。所以生活很困難。天一睛。我的袍子放在典當裏。如何可以短衣見人呢。（按來時穿的雨衣）。所以現在願將七元當票一紙。向你質九元。以備贖袍子。這七元當票是一身。簇新的洋服。至少值三十元。你去贖好了。Ｃ君以爲人在急難中。又是父親昔年的朋友。當然借給他呀。于是就給他九元。並且立刻去寫信告訴他父親。豈知三天以後。父親回信來了。說。這人是個無賴。專門以撞騙爲事。以前也曾向他騙過二元。Ｃ君纔知上了一個大當。但是追悔已不及了。後來Ｃ君遇到許多親戚朋友。都說被這人騙過。而且是借Ｃ君之名的。至于那張當票呢。Ｃ君恐怕再引起什麽糾紛。所以不願意去贖了。</p>
<p>我聽了這件事。不覺就有些感想。試想這班騙子。有很好的外表。有很好的口才做。反墮落到做如此地步。誰爲爲之田孰令致之。眞使我有無限感慨呢。</p>

<p>可見得那玩笑游戲的舉動。也是隨着國體走的。在那中國的國體。還没有改革爲民主的當兒。花國中也是用的帝王制度。所以便有了雉王么王等名目出現。到了後來團體共和以後。那班開玩笑弄筆頭的先生們。開什麽花國選舉。到那時候。不再有大王的雌風。於是便選舉什麽花國大總統了。上海一時有好幾届花國大總統。都出過風頭。甚而至於杭州蘇州的妓院。也尤而效之。此是後話。我今且說除么王以外。還有一位長身玉立。有碩人頎頎之風的。你道何人。伊的名字喚做紅冰小榭。這是時觀平很賞識的。原來凡是女人。都是短小的居多。尤其是所謂美人。譽之者稱伊輩爲嬌小玲瓏。果然大塊頭就不合美人資格。可是矮東瓜的樣子。也使人增厭。長身玉立的確有可取。只要伊不要太瘦。瘦而長却似竹竿一般。要能骨肉停匀。便似寫字一個樣了。但見得豐腴朗潤了。紅冰小榭便是豐腴朗潤的一路。總之是一個身體發育健全的美人。今天也是來看跑馬連帶拍小照的。這個明鏡俱樂部。有了這一班人。也夠熱閙的了。加着嚴一塵·鄭彥修·時觀平·左詩晨這幾位。也常常到這裏來的。今天的看跑馬。這四位便做了特别招待員。自然比了馬霍路那邊的看台上。要舒服而寫意。那時靜安寺路沿跑馬塲周圍。不知道從那裏來的這許多人。都用長凳木板。搭了台。台上要設了椅子。倘然有人要在他們的台上看跑馬的。須收相當的看資。大凡上流社會中人出來看跑馬的。都是包了馬車。馬車上還紥了彩。因爲那時候汽車還很少咧。也有的包了大餐間如一品香之類。携帶了家中太太·小姐·姨太太等。可以憑欄逺眺。那坐在他們木板所搭的台上的。都是些上海周圍的鄉下人。如浦東·江灣·閔行·引翔港等。也有的是小家碧玉。因爲跑馬汛裏。各廠放工。海關封關。那班湖絲阿姐·摇紗阿姐·以及許多開店娘娘。呼姨喚姊。也要及時行樂。有時那搭的台上。人擠得太多了。鬨然一聲。那台坍下來了。引得大家拍手歡呼。好在那台搭的不高。便是坍下來了。也不至於有傷人之事。不過有弄得元寳翻身。却也常有之事。無足爲奇。</p>
<h3>南洋游記（十二）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>廣東各家。亦多奉關公。今則多改掛中山像。蓋民族主義之擴大也。</p>
<p>統觀吾僑在安南各自治團體。大致如下。</p>
<p>（一）各帮。閩帮、廣肇帮、客帮、潮帮、其餘、</p>
<p>總商會（二）職業。米商、藥材、農、工、教育、報社、</p>
<p>（三）社交團體。一報社、二書店、三學校、四書塾、五宗教、佛、耶、六體育、七美術、八音樂以上就忽忽聞見者記其一斑耳、然雖如此。吾甚望其聯絡互助。并研究自治甚深學術。以圖生存而進化也。</p>
<p>連日各報載北圻安南兵叛兩營法軍官受傷事。法政府亦許登載。蓋皆譯自法文報者。今東方之日本旣勃興。暹羅儼爲獨立國。非列賓獨立將成功。印度緬甸安南均要自治。則南洋前途不難推想其將來。去年吾在廣西南寗。有曾與前清中法戰役之老人。述其戰勝法人之功。猶慷慨摩掌。以安南之接近廣西雲南。苟國内統一。華僑之交涉亦甚易辦耳。噫。甚盼國内之和平統一。</p>
<p>西貢氣候。以華氏八十度爲常。今正食西瓜其瓜不甚大。亦甜。</p>
<p>安南地居北緯七度至二十三度之間。南北長三千里。東西寛一二千里。與廣東之欽廉。廣西之龍州。雲南之蒙自。唇齒相連。與海南島隔一帶水相望。地平沃而民淳厚。稻一歳再熟。於中國相接之密廣東猶奉天。而廣西交趾猶吉林黑龍江耳。其歷史關係自唐虞之世。越裳已重譯而來。朝獻白雉。秦置林邑郡徙民焉。漢置交趾九眞日南等郡。蓋非外藩而郡縣也。</p>
<p>光緒十一年中法條約。中國承認越南爲法之保護國。兩國政治關係遂絶。</p>
<h3>常識拾零</h3>
<p>— 湯筆花</p>
<p>拿衣服到洗衣作裏去洗滌。先要在袋裏摸索一下。有無錢鈔。和緊要用品。這雖是極平常的事。但是我却上過幾次當。</p>
<p>買東西最好到同樣的店家去探問價目。所謂貨比三家不吃虧。就是這個意思。</p>
<p>踏上黄包車。先要把磁牌上的號碼記在腦中。萬一在車上遺失了物件。可以向捕房報告。一查即得。没有不珠還合浦的。　　到理髮店裏裏理髮。切勿叫理髮匠挖耳。做眼。搥背。非但有碍衛生。而且還要你多破費些小帳</p>

<h3>現洋客銷仍有厘價疲滯</h3>
<p>市塲概况　連日洋需縱不旺盛、而客銷尚不寂寞故市氣不致有重大之低降昨日形勢雖疲、而人心尚侍、銀根供需懸殊趨勢作摸稜兩可間當此進退維谷之候、欲其高抬、固所不能求其低縮、要亦未能如願總之錢業自受同行裕大之影響後、將來營業上之進展、斷非往年所可同日語焉</p>
<p>厘拆價格　（洋厘）早午兩市因人心寛緊合度、價格無競爭之必要結果同爲七錢二分０一毫二忽半、較前日午市微降一毫二忽半、（銀拆）拆票交易、雖然目下己有做開、好在獨日開發乃漸而不久之舉故銀拆終無抬昂之可能、昨日早市做開五分、午市四分、較前日略小一二分之譜、劃頭加水、則做過二三分、</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋、形勢滯弱、早午兩市皆爲六錢一分六厘、較前日午市跌小二厘做出易交早市四千角、午市一千角廣東小洋、早午兩市亦復相同、計爲五錢九分六厘七毫半、做出交易早市十五萬角午市三萬角銅元又復縮短二千文、爲三百九千文、做出交易二萬八九千串</p>
<p>銀洋進出　（銀欵）昨值星期三、銀行國外匯兌照例淡漠、故各種收解、亦稍簡單、華商收解票欵二百萬左右、外商一百餘萬、各種貨匯稅什電匯各欵收解八百萬光景、另絲出欵五十餘萬進倉一百十萬、日商收解各欵三百餘萬、出倉七十萬、錢莊銀公單收解二千六百餘萬、劃頭欵收解二百五六十萬、各路匯欵收解一百二十餘萬解現四五十萬、（洋欵）匯劃票欵、早市做出七十三萬五千、午市做出八十八萬五千、鈔票早市三萬午市五千塲外鈔票早市九萬七千、午市十一萬三千現洋兩市十萬０五千、銀行交易早市互市六十萬、午市互市五十萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百十餘萬、鈔票進出二百萬强弱、錢莊洋公單收解三百四五十萬洋劃頭欵收解九十餘萬拆借洋欵九十餘萬、小錢莊交易四五十萬客帮購裝現洋新幣三四十萬、來源毫無見聞</p>
<h3>今年期洋之新消息</h3>
<p>往年例有之三月底及四月半之抛盤期洋、交易繁盛進出鉅大溯自受上年停交以來、有時暗盤做開、今年則並暗盤而無之、據該業消息、日前絲商某洋行、欲向錢莊預購國曆五月半（即約往例三月底四月半前後）之期洋、有數百萬胃口、願出七錢二分二厘半之昂價、結果供方靳而勿與卒不成交、聞錢莊方而預算、此項價格届期必超出其上頗不合算如果購方能出七錢二分五厘左右、或可成交一二百萬然亦不能儘量供給、就此可知今年期洋暗盤之難做、而决斷其無重大交易者也</p>

<h3>糧食白粳高達二十元</h3>
<p>閘北　昨日各路來船祗十餘號、市銷極活、常帮白粳陡漲兩角左右、中次北粳亦提角半至兩角半、市上做所特别高粳十九元九角半、已達二十元關口、此價可稱破天荒之新紀錄、倘天宮轉隂、或將步昂未奇、薄稻到稀銷平、隨好角外、羊杜秈因洋未頻昂、店胃目光轉注、大盤均升一兩角不等、客埠各秈尤形秀色、緣裏路客帮暢進、滬埠到貨大枯、零銷競進、貨客扳售、行情續緊、變元隂化本街亦覺爽化、趨勢活潑、價漲近角、</p>
<p>滬南　河下到貨不旺、銷塲續暢、常帮蘇同等機粳、均因内地產區省特殊客户採購及囤運、以致來源日少、報價日增、申地貨主、以往後搬運、成本加重、遂堅守抬售、行情節節向上、昨又緊起角半、此間普通高粳亦在十九元關外、南帮青角等薄早稻、各店户漸告注意、緣稻價尚在抵廉地位、進胃因此見爽、大盤好起一角許、羊杜秈存到兩淡、鄉銷甚旺、以致求過以供、兼西貢小絞頻提之故、本秈亦乃隨升角半、白元微見續挺、走銷殊不開展</p>
<h3>粉價近期五錢進關</h3>
<p>某廠抛出四五萬包</p>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤時、以洋麥報價微好、人心頗見鎭定、惟時局又有不安之象、客帮未免轉趨觀望、其時又因某廠、對三四月份、逐有佳抛、估計在四五萬包之間、因之近期各月份人心甚軟四月份又五錢進關、及下午開盤、本月份亦曾低到二兩五錢、旋以津帮略有抽進、漢空亦稍抵補、遂疲而復定、其餘月份、則大致盤旋、觀後步如北方不靖、恐粉市前途、不免受一度之打擊也、結果三四五月份較前日各小七厘半、六月份不動、七八月份各小二厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥漲落互見</h3>

Han and Shi, knowing Feng's tricks, have decided that thorough cooperation is difficult, and because they were formerly subordinates, once they become brothers, they would be constrained by Feng in everything. Therefore, they all unanimously refused and entrusted Li to take the name cards back. (Nineteenth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Serious Unemployment Problem in Japan</h3>
<p>The number of unemployed people in Japan is increasing daily. The government will make the people thoroughly use domestic goods as a remedy. I have said before that countries with developed industry and commerce will be the first to suffer the panic of industrial and commercial decline. The situation in Japan today will certainly not be limited to Japan alone in the future. Japan is now using the promotion of domestic goods as a remedy, but it is feared that it may not be effective. Why? Japan's need for foreign goods, apart from necessities, is not very large in the first place. Even if all of the country's goods are used and all foreign goods are rejected, it will certainly not be able to prevent the decline of industry and commerce. This is one reason. If Japan used all of its own goods and did not allow the import of foreign goods, other countries would certainly follow suit, causing Japanese goods to be rejected in their own country and colonies. Then the decline of Japanese industry and commerce would inevitably be even more severe. This is another reason. In short, the seriousness of Japan's unemployment problem is due to the sluggishness of the world market, the overabundance of goods, and the lack of purchasing power, not due to the inability of goods to compete or the import of foreign goods causing the elimination of domestic goods. Countries where industry and commerce are not very developed, so promoting domestic goods is effective. The gains are very small and do not compensate for the decline of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>In conclusion, after the development of machinery and the concentration of capital, the world's goods are overproduced and there is no way to sell them. The decline of industry and commerce is an inevitable trend. If the industrialists of the world do not change their methods and strive for a fundamental shift, but still use the old methods of competition to benefit themselves and suppress others, they will ultimately not be able to reverse this global trend, and the unemployment problem will inevitably increase day by day without end. Domestic Key Telegrams 2</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihui and Feng Yuxiang's Correspondence</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central News Agency released three telegrams of correspondence between Wu Zhihui and Feng Yuxiang on the 19th. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Wu Zhihui's original telegram to Feng Yuxiang reads: Xian, Mr. Feng Huanzhang, in remembrance. At the Tangshan meeting in Beiping the year before last, I thought that there would be peace from then on, because you, Mr. Feng, and Generals Chiang and Yan all highly regarded Mr. Zeng Disheng as a person. The world believed that Mr. Zeng was cautious and fearful, only deeply understanding the ways of Huang Lao. His ability to protect himself and stay away from harm was considered the wisdom of the ancient Lü Pu, not something to be discussed in today's democratic era. I secretly think that this is not the case. Cautious and fearful, judging the times and acting accordingly, not ruining the overall situation due to small mistakes, saying that he has the wisdom of Lü Pu, using his way to save the people from suffering, is not impossible. Mr. Feng is upright and resolute, admired by all, but seems to be slightly lacking in fear. Therefore, when Mr. Bai Chuan was about to issue his plan for yielding and deference, I once telegraphed him, jokingly criticizing Mr. Feng for not being perfectly comparable to Zeng. This was also a satire on him. Later, I realized that Yan was even further away from Zeng. Mr. Feng's shortcoming is that he disdains the wisdom of Lü Pu, and even weakens the fear of saving the people from suffering, resulting in the saying in Jian'an Village that Yan controls me, using others as puppets, providing them as sacrifices to come and go, like a nineteen-year-old tumbler. He is too clever, and people are too foolish and loyal. However, he also has one thing to admire, which is that he does not dare to exhaust his strength to appear cunning, but rather uses the opportunity to give the people a rest. The people who are living in misery can still escape death for a moment, which is also fortunate for saving the people from suffering. Therefore, the reputation of opposing force is often attributed to him. I have heard that Mr. Feng has returned to Qin, and I am very glad that he has broken free from his shackles and is able to continue Mr. Feng's own aspirations. However, in my madness and foolishness, I feel that if Mr. Feng can overcome what the world deeply despises and only seeks the benefit of the nation for ten thousand generations, then he can still take on the role of a worker, and success will certainly not be inferior to Yu. This is the highest principle. If he cannot forget the current situation, then wisdom is not for oneself, but only for saving the people, and there is a need for fear, and he should also endure the suffering of the people and give them a strong rest, not rushing for short-term gains and losses. Then Mr. Feng's difficult and extraordinary actions will be used for construction, and the people will only receive his great foolishness. This will also not violate his original wishes. If he just rolls up his sleeves and gets out of the car, then the fisherman will benefit, and the villains will be pleased. Those who are gentlemen will not bear to cry, but will also have no words to solve the problem, because nineteen years of continuous warfare have only caused suffering to the dying people. His past events, Mr. Feng, have also been in the north, south, east, and west, and he has suspended his love to solve the problem. I am deeply grateful for his knowledge and love, and dare to offer my humble opinions. I also inquire about his health. I hope to hear good news. Your junior Wu Jingheng kowtows.</p>
<p>(2) Feng Yuxiang's reply to Wu Zhihui's cold telegram reads: Most urgent, Nanjing, Mr. Wu Zhihui, in remembrance. I have just received Mr. Feng's telegram. After reading it back and forth, I couldn't help but laugh. If Yuxiang doesn't measure himself and wants to reply to Mr. Feng with a telegram, the text reads: Wu Zhihui, an old teenager of sixty years of revolution, no longer talks about the party, nor about the revolution, nor about truth and right and wrong. An old rascal with a grizzled beard, a commoner with a white head, turning against the revolution to become a running dog of one person, determined not to ask about the suffering of the masses. With such behavior, how will he face the late Premier underground? Isn't that too unsightly? Please forgive me, Mr. Feng Yuxiang kowtows. (Nineteenth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(3) Wu Zhihui's telegram to Feng Yuxiang reads: Tongguan, Mr. Feng Huanzhang, in remembrance. I received your reply to my cold telegram. I am extremely grateful for your stern lesson. I think that in your great anger, you could not restrain the writing of your secretary, so you allowed him to use any words he chose. Mr. Feng thinks it is unsightly, but in fact, your colleagues Guo Chuntao, Huang Shaogu, and others are even more than ten times as unsightly when they interrogate people with their pens. How can there be right and wrong when distinguishing red and green through tinted glasses? Whether it is unsightly or not will be distinguished when we are underground. The party that Mr. Feng mentioned probably refers to the Third Plenary Session. Last year, Mr. Li Zongren and others in Wuhan used this to blame people. Mr. Feng, on the other hand, in Zhengzhou, supported the Central Government and criticized it, and was resentful of his personal relationships. Where is Mr. Feng coming from today, talking so much about not being partisan? How dare I follow Mr. Feng's words and be such a fickle party? I have always admired Mr. Feng because I thought he was able to love the country and the people with his hard work and extraordinary actions. This is the true essence of the revolution. Therefore, my previous telegram earnestly asked you to be cautious and fearful, to cease hostilities, and to save the people from suffering. This is following Mr. Feng's words about the true essence of the revolution. If, because of this, he is called an old rascal because of his grizzled beard, and a commoner because of his white head, then it seems that Mr. Feng does not like people to be argumentative friends, but only likes people to be running dogs. How dare I follow Mr. Feng's words and be such a revolutionary running dog? Therefore, I temporarily did not want to talk to Mr. Feng about the party or the revolution, because I wanted to avoid making mistakes. I still want to talk to Mr. Feng about the suffering of the masses, because Mr. Feng does not want to kill and set fires, and vows to be separate from the Communist Party and its tools. I will never believe that Mr. Feng Huanzhang is not concerned about the suffering of the masses. Mr. Feng, on the contrary, said that I was determined not to ask about the suffering of the masses. What are you referring to? Could it be that Mr. Feng mistakenly thinks that starting a war is caring for the suffering of the masses? I am advising Mr. Feng to stop starting a war, is that not asking about the suffering of the masses? May I ask, where does the suffering of the masses come from? Mr. Feng confidently thinks that he is right and that others are wrong, as if the truth all belongs to Mr. Feng. This refers to the question of the sharp increase in taxes and the confusion in politics, which is not very clear. This is a fact, but this is due to the aftermath of the Northern Expedition, which has not yet had time to be reorganized. A year ago, I earnestly hoped that Mr. Feng would firmly work hard and not allow the war to start again. Naturally, it would be stable and clear. In ancient and modern times, in China and abroad, this is the way to start a country. Mr. Feng verbally approved of this, but then he telegraphed a rebuttal in Shandong. I almost suspected that Mr. Feng only liked to be angry and boss people around, and did not want to truly understand the suffering of the masses. Recalling the past year, at first, he wanted all the founding heroes to gather in the capital to maintain permanent peace. But Mr. Feng was in the Lixingshe, showing the Northwest Army's active film, greatly showing off his martial prowess. During the planning for reorganization, letting go of the cattle and sending the horses home, mixing in this strange phenomenon, how can he ban the other party's preparations, thus increasing Mr. Feng's dissatisfaction? Last January, Mr. Feng left without saying goodbye, and unfortunately made a secret agreement with others, so people were greatly taken advantage of, and the Wuhan March battle was formed. Although we cried bitterly, we could not stop the recurrence of war, until now, like malaria that occurs every other day. It will not suit the wishes of Mr. Feng and others until the people are all dead. Mr. Zhao Cilong's telegram said that the most suitable thing is for Mr. Feng and Mr. Bai Chuan to go abroad together. If so, the war can be brought to an end. Unexpectedly, Mr. Bai Chuan claimed to go abroad, but only like a boxer lying on the ground, wanting to suddenly rise up with a flying kick. Mr. Feng was able to be free in Tongguan and also wanted to do a flying kick. It is pitiful that the Central Government is suffering from repeated rebellions, and there is no way to improve the financial situation, which is enough for Mr. Feng and others to criticize. But in fact, Mr. Feng and others are constantly starting wars, to the point where they see things within their borders that cannot be seen by others. The people of Shaanxi and Gansu, bark and grass roots, are not easy to get. Mr. Feng's troops even take the bark and grass roots from them. Mr. Feng's flag of benefiting the people has long been dropped into the toilet by others. The people of Shaanxi and Henan want to eat the flesh of Mr. Feng by the thousands. It is unfortunate that Mr. Feng wants to make his friends proud and oppose the Central Government, but they all have inner shame in their hearts. There is no other reason, it is because of starting wars. However, there have been no wars in Jin and Yan in recent years. But why has the Jin banknote plummeted, and the field tax has been borrowed until after four years? Even in Tongzhou, a small county attached to Ping, the loss of livestock requisition is more than one hundred thousand gold. The financial and political affairs are also in such chaos. There is no other reason, it is all because of preparing to start wars. Therefore, at the mention of the suffering of the masses, if Mr. Feng and others slightly know the way of self-reflection, they will never blame others for no reason and hate those who advise against starting wars. It is time for the prayers of the situation to be changed into illusions. Those who oppose communism and those who tolerate communism are forced to join hands. Those who were previously inferior are suddenly promoted to be deputies. How clumsy the tactics are, and how different the dreams in the same bed are. Today, they point to the sky and draw on the ground, and tomorrow they will fight each other. Everyone has a party, and everyone talks about revolution. I think they will not care about the great chaos for a hundred years, and they will only end after they have completely overthrown the lives of the masses. I humbly hope that you will accept the meaning of the previous telegram and give it another reading. If those around you have lost their reason and are still in a state of shock and anger, then if I were Mr. Feng's subordinate, I would be beaten three hundred times with a board, nailed with shackles and imprisoned. Mr. Feng would also regard it as a common occurrence in the family, and it would be fortunate to be scolded as a running dog and an old rascal. I cannot express my gratitude. Your junior Wu Jingheng kowtows.</p>

<h3>London Conference Deteriorating Again</h3>
<p>Italy Firmly Refuses to Specify Tonnage</p>
<p>Japan Insists on 70% Claim</p>
<p>Reuter's Dispatch from London, 17th: This afternoon the British Prime Minister visited the Italian Plenipotentiary Grandi and reported the results of the Anglo-French negotiations of the 16th, and asked Italy to clearly state the tonnage required. Grandi sternly refused to give a numerical statement, only saying that Italy's requested tonnage was determined by the balance of power of the countries. He only required to maintain the same tonnage as the most dominant country in the European continent. The atmosphere of harmony that had been softened by the Anglo-French meeting has now deteriorated again, returning to the state before Theotoku stepped forward, and France's only requirement has been completely trampled on. The British Prime Minister was forced to take the last resort, ordering the British Ambassador to Italy to visit Premier Mussolini and persuade Italy to clearly state the required tonnage, but the result can be predicted to be desperate. The atmosphere in Europe is deteriorating again, and pessimistic observations on the future of the conference are becoming more and more powerful.</p>
<p>Reuter's Dispatch from London, 18th: During the Anglo-French negotiations, France had already agreed to concede the new demands to 630,000 tons, but Italy had to withdraw its demand for Franco-Italian parity. Now, Theotoku has communicated this intention to the British Prime Minister, but Italy has consistently insisted on Franco-Italian parity, so Anglo-French negotiations are extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Reuter's Dispatch from Tokyo, 19th: The Japanese government will send back its instructions to Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki regarding the new US proposal this weekend or early next week. The content is generally as follows: The US proposal only recognizes Japan's claim of 70% to the US for large cruisers during the temporary period up to 1936. However, the US has only completed four large warships, and plans to have 15 in the future, which is only a plan on paper. It is unreasonable to regard this as existing power. If the conference hereafter recognizes the 10,000-ton cruiser with slightly greater power as 70% to the US, then Japan's proposal will be completely restricted. Therefore, Japan must absolutely adhere to its claim of 70% against the US, and submarines must also be considered defensive weapons, the same as France, and insist on maintaining existing power. Since the United States fears the progress of Japanese shipbuilding technology, it unreasonably lowers the tonnage held. From the point of view of Far East operations, it expresses a tough attitude, and Japan must never give in.</p>
<h3>Customs Truce Conference, Various Countries Agree to Covenant</h3>
<p>Existing Trade Agreements Extended Two Years</p>
<p>Austria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia All Sign</p>

<h3>German President Approves Polish Clearing Agreement</h3>
<p>Greatly Benefits Agricultural Policy</p>
<p>Government Expresses Satisfaction</p>
<p>The National News Agency's dispatch from Berlin, 18th: After careful consideration, President Hindenburg finally approved the Polish Clearing Agreement this afternoon. Thus, the final case regarding the Young Plan and related agreements was approved. Hindenburg wrote to the Prime Minister, saying that his legal advisor initially believed that the Polish Agreement needed to be approved by a two-thirds majority vote, but later changed his mind, saying that a majority of one vote was sufficient. This is why he decided to sign the agreement. His decision was made with consideration of the protests of the powerful minority faction in the parliament. Those who opposed the agreement and the German-Polish trade agreement were understandable, because in the past, the eastern frontier was invaded and the people suffered deeply. In remembrance of past pain, it is no wonder that they feel this way. The main purpose of the agreement is to protect the housing and livelihood of foreigners outside the border, and it is hoped that this wish can be achieved. The book then said that he would urge the government to quickly determine procedures for revitalizing agriculture and industry in the eastern frontier to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>
<p>The National News Agency's dispatch from Berlin, 18th: The government recently issued a communiqué, expressing satisfaction with President Hindenburg's letter to the Prime Minister, believing that it would greatly assist the government's agricultural policy. The communiqué also stated that the mixed faction completely agreed with the agricultural procedure.</p>
<h3>German Parliament Passes Third Reading of New Bill to Defend the Republic</h3>

It is noteworthy that the bill does not restrict actions to abolish the emperor like the old bill, so the abolished emperor can now return to Germany.</p>
<h3>Britain Increases Aviation Budget</h3>

He said that the sky military power of France, Italy, and the United States are all above Britain, but Britain does not want to be involved in the competition of sky military equipment. The total aviation expenditure for 1930 is £17,850,000. The 1929 budget, including a supplementary budget of £760,000, totaled £16,960,000. Therefore, 1930 increased by £890,000 compared to 1929.</p>
<h3>British Coal Mine Crisis Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>Reuter's dispatch from London, 18th: The Liberal Party Members of Parliament met and decided not to support the Conservative Party's vote on important amendments, so as not to embarrass the government when the Five Power [Naval Treaty] has not ended. Therefore, the government's concerns about the coal mine crisis have been greatly reduced. However, this decision of the Liberal Party only refers to today's vote. The Liberal Party reserves its freedom of action when this case is in its third reading.</p>

<p>Reuter's dispatch from Tokyo, 19th: Various factions in the House of Peers, with the recent unemployed people increasing endlessly, have gradually condemned the government's incompetence.

<h3>219th Central Political Conference</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 19th, the 319th Central Political Conference was held. Committee members present: Lin Sen, Gu Yingfen, Tan Yankai, Hu Hanmin, Wang Chonghui, He Yingqin, Yu Youren, Chen Guofu, Sun Ke, Song Ziwen, Ye Chucang, Shao Lizi. Observers present: Shao Yuanchong, Wang Zhengting, Kong Xiangxi, Li Wenfan, Liu Jiwen. Chairman: Tan Yankai. Matters discussed were as follows: (1) Various proposals submitted by the Third Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee were resolved to be distributed by the Secretariat according to their nature, first to various groups for review and submission of opinions, and then to be submitted to the meeting for discussion in batches. (2) Committee member Wang Chonghui reported on the case submitted for review on whether the debt settlement standards applied by the Wuhan Provisional Commercial Court should continue to be effective. It was found that the debt settlement standards were originally formulated to resolve disputes over debts and credits caused by the concentration of cash in Wuhan merchants. The establishment of the Wuhan Commercial Court was to deal with debt disputes in accordance with these standards. Although the court has now ended, the dispute about this kind of debts and credits has not been cleared, and it is still necessary for ordinary courts to continue the clearing. After examining the content of the debt settlement standard, it seems that it can be allowed to continue to be effective for application. It is appropriate to do so, and it is still waiting for public decision. The resolution was passed according to the review opinion. (3) It was resolved to approve Committee member Ye Chucang's request to resign from his concurrent position as Secretary-General of the Political Conference, and to promote Committee member Chen Lifu to concurrently serve as Secretary-General of the Political Conference.</p>

The gist of the note is that since the agreement on the Chinese Court in the Shanghai Public Concession has been signed, the Public Concession and the French Concession should be treated equally, and consultations should be held to resolve the matter. According to sources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Shanghai French Concession Court has no basis in the treaty. Initially, the French Consulate only established a court within the consulate to hear cases occurring within the concession. During the Qing Dynasty, Chinese Daotai also often sent personnel to the French Consulate for joint trials. At the beginning of the Republic of China, the court in the Shanghai International Settlement was vacant, and its affairs were abandoned along with it. When the treaty was concluded in 1914 for the expansion of the French Concession, it was stipulated that a special court should be established within the Concession for Chinese judges to hear cases. Later, without the consent of the Chinese government, the French Consul automatically began construction of the courthouse and moved in on October 21, 1915 to hear cases. Although the Jiangsu negotiator protested, there was no result. However, there is no doubt that the sovereignty of the French Court of the French Concession should be returned to China. This time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a note based on China's inherent sovereignty, requesting that it be recovered and converted into a Chinese court, which is a most appropriate method. The French side has no reason to refuse the recovery.</p>
<h3>Provinces and Cities Establish Opium Suppression Committees</h3>
<p>The Central Opium Suppression Committee Has Passed Organizational Regulations</p>
<p>The Central Opium Suppression Committee stipulates in Article 20 of the new Opium Suppression Implementation Regulations promulgated by the National Government that all provincial and municipal opium suppression committees should be established in places where senior local governments are located. Under the orders of the Central Opium Suppression Committee and the supervision of senior local governments of the province, the whole province or the whole city is responsible for the suppression of opium. The Committee believes that the supervision or implementation of opium suppression in various provinces and cities are within the scope of the provincial and municipal governments. With the complexity of the government affairs in one province or city, it is inevitable to attend to one thing and lose sight of another. Considering the situation, it is necessary to set up opium suppression committees in the places where the senior local governments are located. The responsibilities are specifically assigned and it is expected that the opium disaster can be eliminated sooner. A draft of the organization regulations for the provincial and municipal opium suppression committees has been proposed and amended and passed at the 29th regular meeting. The draft is recorded as follows: (Article 1) The provincial and municipal opium suppression committees are organized in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the Opium Suppression Implementation Regulations. (Article 2) The provincial and municipal opium suppression committees are named after the province or special municipality where they are located, such as the Opium Suppression Committee of a certain province or special municipality. (Article 3) The provincial and municipal opium suppression committees, under the order of the Central Opium Suppression Committee and the supervision of the senior local government, shall supervise the suppression of opium throughout the province or the entire special municipality. (Article 4) The provincial and municipal opium suppression committees have the power to directly command the water and land public security organs to carry out opium suppression affairs in the province and city. (Article 5) The provincial and municipal opium suppression committees shall have three to five members, who shall be appointed by the Central Opium Suppression Committee and designate one person as the chairman. (Article 6) The following officials shall be ex officio members of the provincial and municipal opium suppression committees: A. The heads of the departments of civil affairs and education of the provincial government, and the president of the High Court; B. The heads of the bureaus of social affairs, public security, health, and education of the special municipality, and the president of the District Court. (Article 7) The provincial and municipal opium suppression committees shall hold a regular meeting once a week. The events resolved shall be implemented by the chairman. (Article 8) The provincial and municipal opium suppression committees shall have one secretary, who shall handle all confidential meeting affairs under the orders of the chairman and members. (Article 9) The provincial and municipal opium suppression committees shall have two section chiefs and six to twelve staff members, who shall be responsible for the affairs of each section under the orders of the chairman. (Article 10) The provincial and municipal opium suppression committees may employ employees for writing documents and handling other affairs. (Article 11) The detailed rules for the provincial and municipal opium suppression committees shall be determined separately. (Article 12) These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Appeal for Disaster Relief in Henan Province by the Henan Provincial Committee</h3>
<p>To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters Executive and Supervisory Committees, National Government Chairman Chiang, the Presidents of all Yuan (branches of government), all Ministers, and the Relief Committee Chairman Xu Junjian:</p>
<p>Henan Province has suffered from frequent disasters and crop failures for years, and has now been afflicted by war. The deaths and displacements, and the devastation are heartbreaking. The Relief Committee has reported these dire circumstances in detail via telegram. However, at present, disaster victims are gathering in Shaanxi, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, and Kaifeng, filling the streets and alleys. The Longhai Railway is crowded with those coming from the east, numbering several thousand each day. There is no money for relief, and insufficient capacity to accommodate them. The dozens of counties, including Linbao, Jiaxian, Luyi, Lu's Gate, Lingbao Town, and Xi, are plagued by soldiers and bandits everywhere. Taking a step is like walking through thorns. To stay means waiting for death; to flee means there is nowhere to go. For example, Shiling Town in Yiyang, originally a bustling market, had over two thousand households. After being burned and looted by bandits, only a few dilapidated temples remain. Within a radius of fifty li, everyone has fled. Now is the time for spring plowing, but not only are plowing tools and seeds completely gone, even the houses that sheltered them have long been reduced to ashes. And this situation is not limited to Shiling alone. Zhenping County was devastated by bandits and razed to the ground. Linru Town was turned into scorched earth by fierce battles between two armies. Similar catastrophic conditions are too numerous to list. Last year, central Henan suffered two military calamities. South of the Yellow River, north of Wan and Shen, over forty counties were engulfed in the war zone. The planting of winter wheat was less than twenty percent of what it should have been. If the planting of early autumn crops is also missed, there will be no hope for next year's wheat crop either. Disaster following disaster, it seems there will be no end. Zhen Zuan and others, shamefully guarding this land, are powerless to rescue them. Witnessing these tragic scenes, we cannot bear to remain silent. We earnestly request a strict order to all armies to suppress the bandits in their respective areas to pacify the residents. Swiftly allocate substantial funds for disaster relief to sustain the lives of the survivors, so that the millions of disaster victims may have hope for recovery. This urgent telegram is sent with utmost anxiety.</p>
<p>Wu Zhenzuan, President of the Henan Higher Court; Li Shuchun, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs; Wang Xiangrong, Director of the Department of Finance; Zhang Honglie, Director of the Department of Education; Zhang Fang, Director of the Department of Construction, respectfully submit this appeal.</p>

<p>Important News 2</p>
<h3>Zhang Huizan Appointed Commander-in-Chief for Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>Zhang to Immediately Depart for Jiangxi to Suppress Communists</p>
<p>Jin Handing's Entire Division to Return to Jiangxi to Assist in Suppression</p>
<p>Provincial Government Establishes Four Police Training Regiments</p>
<p>Nanchang dispatch, 18th. Besides the local defense forces in each county, the bandit suppression forces in this province include six brigades under Dai Yue, Zhu Yaohua, Cheng Guangyao, Tang Yunshan, Deng Ying, and Zhang Yuren, as well as two regiments under Chen Lei and Zeng Zhenxiang. The military strength is not weak. However, without a unified commander, the forces are difficult to concentrate, so Zhu Mao's bandits can still flee from one place to another. Chairman Lu therefore submitted a request some days ago, and Commander-in-Chief Chiang appointed Zhang Huizan, the commander of the 18th Division, concurrently as the Bandit Suppression Commander for the entire province of Jiangxi, entrusting him with full responsibility. Zhang telegraphed his acceptance of the position today and established the Bandit Suppression Headquarters for the entire province of Jiangxi. It is divided into four sections: Staff, Adjutant, Secretariat, and Military Law. The Chief of Staff of the division, Staff Officer Xiao, will serve concurrently as the Chief of the General Staff. The Chief of the Garrison Headquarters, Staff Officer Huang, will serve concurrently as the Chief of the Staff Section. The Chief of the Enforcement Office of the division, Xu, will serve concurrently as the Chief of Military Law. Huang Xingyi will be appointed as the Chief of the Secretariat. With the internal organization in place, Zhang plans to lead the headquarters to Ji'an in western Jiangxi tomorrow to command everything. The Provincial Government's Bandit Suppression Propaganda Office will also follow along. However, at a time when bandits and communists are as numerous as hemp and the red flames are high, Commander-in-Chief Zhang is still concerned that the military strength is insufficient. In addition to urging the Luo Lin division and the Yan Zhongru brigade, which have been ordered to Jiangxi for bandit suppression, to set off quickly, he has also telegraphed Chairman Chiang to order Jin Handing's entire division to return to Jiangxi to assist in the suppression. It is said that Commander-in-Chief Chiang has approved Jin's entire division to return to Jiangxi via telegram. Therefore, Division Commander Zhang telegraphed Jin yesterday, saying, "Commander-in-Chief Jin, secret. Your younger brother previously received an order to command the Jiangxi campaign against Zhu Mao's troops. Because the strength was weak, I did not dare to take office rashly. Now I have received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang, asking me to request your honorable division to return to Jiangxi to suppress the Jiangxi bandits. I was overjoyed to hear this. I will immediately rush to the front to supervise the troops. I await your telegram for the plan and will work hard to advance the campaign, hoping to follow in your honorable footsteps to clear the Jiangxi bandits, relieve the Central Government's internal worries, and eliminate the local scourge of many years. I am inspired and eager to serve. I send this sincere message. Your brother, Zhang Huizan, stamped at dawn." As for the Provincial Government, regarding the bandit disaster as the most serious issue at present, it has devoted all its efforts to the suppression work. In addition to drafting a bandit suppression plan and establishing a Bandit Suppression Committee, it has also set a deadline of April 1st to establish four police training regiments to establish self-defense forces to fundamentally eradicate the bandits and communists.</p>
<h3>He Chengjun Returns to Hankou by Plane</h3>
<p>He Issues Statement to the Press</p>
<p>Hankou dispatch. He Chengjun, Acting Director of the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters, was summoned by Commander-in-Chief Chiang via telegram. He took a commercial airline flight to Nanjing on the 15th of this month, arriving at noon. Regarding the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, the defense of northern Hubei, the pacification of the entire province, and the Wuhan garrison, he separately requested instructions when he met with Commander-in-Chief Chiang. He only returned to Hankou on the original flight at 8:00 AM on the 17th, arriving at the airport at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Those who came to the airport to welcome him included the Second Army Commander Jiang Dingwen, the Tenth Army Commander Xu Yuanquan, the Thirteenth Army Commander Xia Douyin, and the Chief of Staff of the Fifth Route Army, Chen Guangzu. After He got off the plane, he and Jiang Dingwen and others took separate cars to the Provisional Headquarters for a tea talk meeting. First, He reported on his visit to the Commander-in-Chief in Nanjing and the Commander-in-Chief's future military measures in this area. Then, Jiang Dingwen and others separately reported on the defense situation and requested instructions on everything. It is said that there was also a brief discussion on the current situation. The meeting lasted two hours. He then received the press and issued the following statement, "I was summoned to Nanjing on the 15th and met with the Commander-in-Chief that evening to request instructions on military matters. In order to implement the policy of peaceful unification, the Central Government has been lenient with all reactionary soldiers, hoping they will repent. If they continue to be unrepentant and launch large-scale attacks again, we will launch another major campaign. Now, Yan Xishan is surrounded by reactionaries and is using retreat as a way to advance. His conspiracies are becoming increasingly exposed. If he destroys peaceful unification, he will be digging his own grave. The Central Government has its own methods to eliminate reactionaries when the time comes. As for the rumors that Feng Yuxiang has arrived at Tongguan, this is true. However, Feng's troops were previously defeated by the Central Government, and their elite troops have been exhausted. Moreover, there are great internal divisions, so it is difficult for them to cooperate with Yan. Currently, Henan Province Chairman Han Fuju and Commander-in-Chief Shi Yousan are wholeheartedly supporting the Central Government, and their troops have advanced to the Daokou Zhangde area in Hebei. Even if Yan and Feng want to launch an attack, it is impossible. As for all matters here, I have requested instructions from the Commander-in-Chief on essential points. All the troops in northern Hubei have also been assigned by Commander-in-Chief Chiang to be under the command of Tenth Army Commander Xu Yuanquan. Regarding the pacification issue, the establishment of four Provincial Defense Regiments has been approved, and the guns will be allocated by the Central Government. After the soldiers are recruited, we will submit a request to the Central Government to receive them." (March 18th)</p>
<h3>News of the Reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Government</h3>
<p>There has been talk of reorganizing the Jiangsu Provincial Government for a long time, but it has only been realized recently due to the many changes in the situation. It is said that the members announced by the National Government this time were all carefully considered before a decision was made. However, most of the members are scattered in Nanjing and Shanghai, so the date of their assumption of office has not yet been determined. It was originally decided that Hu Puan, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, would come to Zhenjiang after receiving the appointment letter from the National Government. Now, because of a letter urging from Ye Chucang, he plans to go to Nanjing first. After everything is negotiated, he will come to the province. Sun Hongzhe, the Director of the Department of Construction, plans to come to Zhenjiang before the 20th. As for the three members who are leaving the Provincial Government, Niu Miaozhang, Zhang Shouyong originally served concurrently as the Director of the Jiangsu Department of Finance while serving as the Vice Minister of Finance. From now on, he will be stationed in Nanjing permanently, serving only as the Vice Minister of Finance. It was initially said that Chairman Niu would be reassigned as the Chief of Civil Officials of the National Government, but this has now been proven inaccurate. It is said that the Ministry of Interior will be reorganized, and Niu may be promoted to Minister. Miao Bin went to Nanjing in a hurry the day before yesterday and returned to the province yesterday. He has ordered the staff of the Department of Civil Affairs to rush to handle the handover. It is expected that the affairs of the Department will be handed over completely within a week, and then he will go to Nanjing. According to reports, the authorities intend to give him a military position.</p>
<p>After the reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, new plans will be made for the command and organization of police affairs. The general situation is that the affairs of water and land public security will be separated from the Department of Civil Affairs and established as an independent agency, with the new Provincial Committee member Li Mingyang responsible for overseeing it. It is said that the National Government previously decided that each province could establish a police department. When Chairman Niu was the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs in the Jiangsu Provincial Government, he also established a Water and Land Public Security Administration Office. It is said that the new Provincial Government's organization of the police department will be directly under the Provincial Government. As for the suppression of lake bandits, the Department of Civil Affairs previously planned to establish a Pacification Office in a suitable location in the Taihu Lake area to be responsible for pacification. It is now planned that after the new members take office, they will discuss with the Zhejiang Provincial Government to establish the Taihu Lake Pacification Office as soon as possible in order to eliminate the lake bandits.</p>
<h3>Su Bingwen Succeeds Liang Zhongjia's Position</h3>
<p>Russian Troops Still Provoking on the Border</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch, 14th. On the evening of the 13th, over one hundred Russian cavalrymen secretly entered Tuolannor and looted two steel cannons, over thirty cannonballs, and twenty-six Type 38 rifles from our army. At the time, our army raised their guns to pursue, but were stopped by their superiors, so they were allowed to loot as they pleased. That night at 10:00 PM, thunderous artillery fire occurred between the Xiaozhan train station at the 18th milepost and the main station, lasting for half an hour before stopping. Merchants and residents were startled from their sleep, and many were panicked and did not know what to do. Fortunately, the artillery fire soon stopped, and they calmed down. Now that Liang Zhongjia has passed away in Manzhouli, merchants and residents have lost their security, and many have moved back to the mainland. Although the troops have formed a joint defense and are under martial law, it is not enough to calm people's hearts. As for Liang's vacant position (commander of the 15th Brigade, Pacification Commissioner of Hulunbuir, and commander of the Harbin-Manchuria Railway Protection Army), the province has announced that Su Bingwen, the Chief of Staff of the Border Defense Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Office, will succeed him. He will go to take over the duties within days. Liang's coffin has not yet been transported back to his hometown. In addition to the three thousand yuan allocated by Zhang Xueliang for funeral expenses, Wan Fulin of Heilongjiang also gave two thousand yuan and sent Dou Lianfang, the Director of the Public Security Administration Office, to Hailar to represent him in paying respects.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Construction Department Presents a Report on the Process of Banning Artificial Fertilizers</h3>
<p>Lists Seven Suggestions for Banning</p>
<p>Requests the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining to Take Charge</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Construction Department believes that in recent years, artificial fertilizers have flooded the market with varying qualities. Farmers blindly believe in advertisements and do not distinguish between good and bad. They casually purchase and use them, often leading to the deterioration of the soil and damage to crops, which is extremely important for the future of agriculture. Natural fertilizers, such as soybean cakes, rapeseed cakes, and cottonseed cakes, are instead sold abroad at low prices. Previously, they jointly proposed with the Department of Finance to reduce and exempt natural fertilizer taxes and ban exports in order to provide relief. The proposal has been approved and implemented by the Provincial Government Committee. An agricultural chemistry laboratory has also been attached to the Mineral Resources Survey Institute to collect samples of artificial fertilizers for precise chemical testing at any time in order to find ways to ban them. At the same time, a booklet advising farmers to use more natural fertilizers has been printed and distributed to various counties to widely encourage them. Now, they have received an instruction from the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, stating that the Shanghai Ellis Foreign Firm has submitted a request to instruct the firm's fertilizer powder sold in Zhejiang Province to be slightly promoted. The original submission was copied and ordered to be observed and handled. The situation of Zhejiang Province's promotion of natural fertilizers and banning of artificial fertilizers has been reported to the Ministry of Agriculture, and the following suggestions for banning are listed: (1) Please issue a general order to the agricultural agencies under the Ministry's jurisdiction and across the country to conduct more tests and widely publicize the large quantities of natural fertilizers produced in various places so that farmers will be happy to use them. (2) Please consult with the Ministry of Finance and consult with the provincial and municipal governments to issue a general order to exempt taxes and fees on natural fertilizers produced in their respective areas and prohibit their export in order to avoid sales abroad so that domestic farmers can purchase and use them at low prices. (3) Please consult with the three ministries of Finance, Transportation, and Railways, and the provincial and municipal governments to increase tariff taxes and transportation costs on imported artificial fertilizers in order to restrict them. (4) Please plan to establish a government-business joint-stock fertilizer factory to promote them in practice. (5) Those who manufacture high-quality artificial fertilizers in our country should be clearly defined in regulations and given special awards. (6) The mineral fertilizers produced in various provinces should be consulted with the provincial and municipal governments to find ways to explore and extract them for use in the common manufacture of fertilizers. (7) Please order the agricultural product inspection institutes under the Ministry's jurisdiction to strictly define standards and issue certificates carefully for imported artificial fertilizers. The unqualified fertilizers must be widely announced and strictly prohibited from sale in order to prevent farmers from being deceived.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Record of a Trial Involving a Litigation Settlement: Shen Anfu, a wealthy man from Yaojiajiao in Xinzhuang Township, passed away on December 26th of last year. Because he had no children during his lifetime, he adopted his sister-in-law's son, Wang Zuoliang, as his son, giving him the surname Shen, and adopted Ou Hong as his daughter. Wang Zuoliang was adopted at the age of six and is now seventeen years old. In December of last year, when Anfu was seriously ill, he invited relatives Liu Jianzhang, Liu Shoujian, Wang Baoxian, and his nephew Shen Jiajun to sign a will, giving 300 mu of land to his nephew Jiajun and the rest to Xu Zuoliang. However, although the will was made at that time, it was not signed by Jiajun. Recently, Jiajun filed a lawsuit against Shen Liu (Anfu's wife) for adopting a different surname and disrupting the family order. The county government held a hearing today. The plaintiff Shen Jiajun hired lawyer Qu Yue as his assistant, and Shen Zuoliang hired lawyer Zhang Enhao as his agent due to illness. Shen Liu personally appeared in court. After the judge Du summoned the plaintiff and defendant to state their cases, the plaintiff did not recognize the will, saying that it was fundamentally illegal and could not take effect. The defendant presented Liu Shoujian and Wang Baoxian as witnesses, proving that Jiajun was indeed present when the will was made. Then, Zhang Enhao stated that the plaintiff's lawsuit for adopting a child required the consent of both parties. Now, the person being inherited does not want the plaintiff to be the heir, which has been proven in the will. Therefore, whether there is a dispute over the right to sue in this case is still a question. The plaintiff's assistant, Qu Yue, stated that according to our country's customs, a fox dies with its head facing its hill. After Anfu died, the plaintiff did hold the head during the encoffining, which is not difficult to investigate. The judge, seeing that both parties were wealthy, tried to mediate, instructing them to mediate within twenty days. Both lawyers were very supportive, and the court adjourned.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Rogue Soldiers Kill Villagers While Robbing Gambling: Jinghui Temple, located in the 326th Tu of Xin'an Township, is one of the eight major temples in Wuyi. Incense is very popular. Every year on the nineteenth day of the second month of the lunar calendar, it is the birthday of Guanyin. The temple holds a warm-up ceremony the day before, chanting incense and chanting scriptures all night. The day before yesterday was the day of the warm-up ceremony, so the temple was extremely lively. Some villagers took the opportunity to open a gambling den near the temple at the Zhou Shen family's house, shouting and drinking, and the winnings and losses were quite large. Unexpectedly, at about 11:00 PM, more than ten rogue soldiers suddenly came, holding long guns, and crowded into the Zhou Shen family's house. The gamblers fled in panic. The rogue soldiers opened fire and fired into the crowd. At that time, a villager named Xu Aquan, nicknamed "Puluotou" Aquan, was fat and unable to run away, so he was shot in the abdomen and fell to the mulberry field outside the wall, dying instantly. Another villager, Yuan Aquan, was shot in the left leg, and blood flowed like a torrent, kicking the ground in extreme pain. The rogue soldiers, seeing that they had caused trouble, left swaggeringly. Afterwards, the injured Yuan Aquan was sent to the Western doctor at Hua Dafang Zhuang for treatment. It is said that the injury was quite serious and may become a disability. Yesterday, Zhou Puzhai, the deputy head of Jinghui Township, and Xu Asan, the younger brother of the deceased Xu Aquan, came to the city to report to the county for an inquest. This morning, Judge Yu took a steamboat to the countryside for an inquest.</p>

They opened Shen's daughter's door, tied up Shen's daughter and Er's young son with ropes, and beat them severely, causing Shen's daughter to be covered in wounds. The bandits then ransacked the boxes and chests at will, searching and looting. After an hour, they left with the stolen goods. After checking, it was reported that they stole twelve yuan in silver dollars, four jiao in small silver dollars, four thousand copper coins, over two shi of white rice, and clothing, jewelry, etc., totaling a loss of over one hundred yuan.</p>

<p>Old Guqiao Kills Two Bandits: Liu Baorun, the chief of the fourth district of Wuyi, received a secret report on the evening of the 16th of this month that the die-hard followers of the executed bandit leaders Bao Laohu and Wan Gouda intended to gather bandits that night to loot Xiaoxinqiao Town and kill the staff of the district office in retaliation for the deaths of Wan Gouda and Bao Laohu. District Chief Liu immediately instructed the public security station to stay in the town for defense and secretly sent the security regiment to Laoguqiao to investigate and arrest them. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at the place, the bandits opened fire to resist arrest. The security regiment immediately returned fire, killing two bandits on the spot. The remaining bandits fled. District Chief Liu went to investigate the killing of the two bandits on the 17th. One was Guo Jida and the other was Chen Ronggen. According to the villagers, they were indeed die-hard followers of the executed bandit leaders Bao Laohu and Wan Gouda and were the main culprits in this planned looting and retaliation. He immediately prepared a document to report to the county and went to conduct an inquest today (the 19th).</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Transfers the Chief of the Dong Sub-Bureau: Li Leng, the director of the Wuyi County Public Security Bureau, in order to implement the internal and external duties handled by police officers of the same rank, has transferred Yu Baoying, the chief of inspectors of the bureau, to serve as the chief of the sixth sub-bureau. The original chief of the sixth sub-bureau, Wang Sidan, was transferred to serve as the chief of the third sub-bureau. The original chief of the third sub-bureau, Pu Zhengshu, was transferred to serve as the chief of inspectors. On the 18th, he separately reported to the county for filing and informed the officers to comply with the transfer and appointment.</p>

<p>The Western Doctor's Autopsy of the Liu Daughter-in-Law Case: After the autopsy of Cai Lianbao, the daughter-in-law of the Liu family in Shanxiang Lane, Dr. Gu Yuanhao of Jishan Hospital disagreed with the other nine doctors because he had not co-signed the report. The nine doctors had sent a letter to Dr. Gu requesting a response. Before receiving the letter, Dr. Gu responded to several points based on newspaper reports as follows: (1) Whether the section of the intestine removed was indeed the duodenum was uncertain as he had not examined it and thus could not say for sure. For the sake of caution, a re-examination was necessary. If, as Dr. Zhou stated, the section removed was part of the jejunum, about three inches from the stomach, then he believes that there was no need to leave these three inches, causing the important parts (the openings of the bile and pancreatic ducts) to be left in the abdominal cavity, while removing a more distant and difficult segment. (2) Methods of death by poisoning include arsenic, phosphorus, mercury, and acid, all of which are effective. Since the gentlemen suspected opium poisoning, was the testing and determination recorded in the examination report? (3) Before any autopsy, one must determine what illness caused the death of the deceased. Only if no signs of death are found can one suspect poison. During the autopsy, one should be thorough in every aspect, such as examining the brain, large and small intestines, gallbladder, bile ducts, reproductive organs, etc. During the county government meeting, he stated that the brain should be dissected, but the gentlemen said it was not important and cancelled the idea. If important parts can be cancelled, then there seems to be no possibility of further suggestions. (4) There are regulations for dissecting corpses. He originally wanted to state at the scene, but Dr. Zhou suddenly split the middle of the abdominal cavity. If a correction was to be made, there were many doctors involved, which was awkward. Unexpectedly, a sincere effort turned into an opinion, which is deeply regrettable. In short, we cannot shirk responsibility for the negligence of this autopsy. After the publication of this article, Chen Shitao, the trial officer of the county government, convened nine doctors who had dissected and chemically examined Cai's corpse, including Zhou Mansun, Gu Jianshan, Shao Yufan, Xue Baoshan, Xie Tang, Gu Zhiru, Wu Juncheng, Zhou Tianlai, and Zhou Guanwen, along with Huang Chengxi, the president of Jishan Hospital, and Dr. Gu Yuanhao, at 4:00 PM on the 15th to discuss the autopsy. The meeting was chaired by Chen Shitao. On that day, Gu Jianshan, Zhou Mansheng, Shao Yufan, and Gu Yuanhao engaged in a major debate. The Qin Bao reporter also testified that Gu Yuanhao did say he had cultivated cerebrospinal fluid after the autopsy. Therefore, this newspaper reported the facts. The chairman said to Gu that since he had denied it, the newspaper should be asked to correct it. The Qin Bao reporter said that Dr. Gu did say this and it was not convenient to correct it. The chairman then said that the reporters from each newspaper could publish the discussions at the meeting and then adjourned the meeting. The day after the meeting, Huang Chengxi, the president of Jishan Hospital, raised the issue of the dissection instruments. All the knives, pliers, and instruments used to dissect Cai's corpse were newly purchased by Jishan Hospital. Gu Yuanhao brought these instruments to the autopsy site and Zhou Mansun performed the abdominal procedure. Afterwards, it was discovered that these instruments were contaminated with cadaveric poison and could no longer be used for dissecting live people. Sterilization requires 120 pounds of firepower, but the hospital's sterilizer only has 100 pounds of firepower. Therefore, these instruments are now useless except for dissecting corpses. Fortunately, only a portion of the instruments were used in this case. If all were used, the value would be around a thousand gold. It is heard that President Huang will inquire with Gu Yuanhao whether he mentioned the disposal of the instruments during the autopsy before deciding on a solution.</p>
<p>Scheduled Demolition of the Outer Walls of the Big and Small East Gates: The Construction Bureau presented a request to the Construction Department to use the bricks and stones from the demolition of the outer walls of the Big and Small East Gates to build bridges and culverts on the Xichang section of the Yichang Road. This time, only the demolition labor and transportation costs were put out to tender. Wang Rongji, a foreman from outside the South Gate of this county, won the bid and went to the Construction Bureau on the 16th to sign the contract, pay the deposit, and schedule the start of demolition for the outer wall of the Small East Gate on the 28th of this month and the outer wall of the Big East Gate on April 8th.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>Coastal Bandits Harassing Various Fields in Tongtai: The coastal fields of Tongtai in Jiangbei are now experiencing the spring tide. Bandit ships are taking advantage of the tide to invade inland ports, forcing fishing boats to pay fees and raise flags. In the Lvsi and Juegang areas, bandits burned the boats of Ji Lianru and others who refused to pay. They also frequently kidnap people from nearby towns and demand ransoms. Wealthy households such as Pan Zhibu have been kidnapped for over ten days and their whereabouts are still unknown. Investigation of the Handover of Previous County Magistrates: The handover of previous county magistrates in Nantong over the past ten years has not been completed. The Finance Bureau, under the order of the Finance Department, is conducting a thorough investigation and has notified each former magistrate to come to Tong to settle the accounts and complete the handover.</p>
<p>Joint Suppression of the Zhen Tao Bandit Gang: A large bandit gang is entrenched in Zhen Tao Township in Rugao County, causing great harm. The Provincial Government has ordered the county magistrates of Nantong and Rugao to lead police teams and cooperate with Li Changjiang, the captain of the Provincial Police Corps, to be responsible for suppressing the bandits and clearing them within half a month.</p>
<p>Remedy for the County's Financial Deficit: Nantong's local finances have recently suffered a deficit of over 63,300 yuan, which cannot be made up. The Finance Bureau is urgently awaiting allocations for administrative and police expenses. Currently, it has temporarily borrowed 50,000 yuan from the financial sector at interest, using surtaxes as collateral.</p>
<p>Catholic Church's Land Purchase Case: The Nantong Catholic Church has recently been purchasing civilian land near the church. The county government has already investigated the matter. However, whether this is feasible or should be stopped has been reported to the province for referral to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for interpretation.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The Finance Bureau's Debt is Difficult for the County Magistrate to Approve: The Finance Bureau, due to the dire financial situation of the locality, drafted relief measures, first raising a short-term loan of 40,000 yuan, and then soliciting local public bonds of 100,000 yuan, submitting them to the county for approval. Yesterday, an instruction was received stating that the local expenses not collected under the busy transport item in previous years amounted to more than 150,000 yuan. The reason for the difficulty in the expenses of various agencies is not that there is no money to collect, but that there is money that is not collected. The bureau's responsibility lies in not devising ways to collect and promote prosperity, but in advocating ways to borrow money. Regardless of the large number of bonds, the people find it difficult to bear, and they ignore the money that should be collected, and willingly borrow with heavy interest, causing losses to the locality, which is also contrary to reason. It was found that at the 49th county political meeting on January 6, a resolution was made regarding the problem of insufficient income and expenditure of various agencies, and the bureau was asked to formulate a method and convene various agencies that use money to discuss it together. The bureau shirks its responsibility, which is not appropriate. The example of raising money in the locality when military affairs occur is used in the submission, but there is no indication of money in the budget. It is a fallacy to cite the previous example, cutting flesh to mend sores. If this continues, the locality will inevitably have more than 100,000 yuan of debt forever, which is difficult to approve.</p>
<p>Reprimand for Joint Recommendation of Head Teachers by Rural School Joint Council: Wu Baotong, Executive Committee of the Rural School Principals Joint Council, and others, specially selected and recommended Yang Qinghong as the Director of the Education Bureau because Lin Youming, the Director of the Education Bureau, was transferred to the province, and submitted it to the county for transfer. County Magistrate Shen believed that the Joint Council was illegal, and the Executive Committee submitted a presentation in the name of recommending Yang Qinghong to succeed as the Director of the Education Bureau, which shows that the establishment of the Council is solely for the purpose of attacking and recommending the Director. It is a clever way to establish a name and call on groups, which is a deliberate violation of the law and should be reprimanded and cancelled immediately.</p>
<p>Rice Seized for Discrepancies in Cargo Documents: Rice merchant Chen Jingui, representing Dada Company, went to Wuxi to purchase 500 shi of rice. When passing through Jiangyin, he was detained by the first branch of the Public Security Bureau. The passport was delivered, but because the passport stated 500 shi and the tax bill only stated 300 shi, there was a discrepancy in the cargo documents and it was immediately detained. Now the county government has ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate and reply together with the Chamber of Commerce. Also, Zou Guozhen, owner of Gong Sheng Rice Shop in the Central Justice Township of the Third District, purchased 400 shi of Xiang rice from Wuxi because of the limited rice in the district. Now he first loaded and transported 120 shi of the rice and exported it through Huangtian Port. Yesterday, he presented it to the first branch of the Public Security Bureau and transferred it to the General Bureau for presentation to the county for verification. The General Bureau believed that the matter concerned the people's food and had presented it to the county for instructions.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>Liu Changyan Removed from Office and Investigated: Liu Changyan, the magistrate of Rufou County, was removed from office and investigated for improper measures and boiling public resentment less than five months after taking office, and was repeatedly accused to the province. Recently, an order was received from the province stating that the county magistrate was ineffective in suppressing bandits and abused his powers. After receiving the order, Liu led two squads of county police and dozens of subordinates (county government and Qingxiang Bureau officials were all brought by Liu) on a wheel from Ru at about 8:00 PM on the 14th. The successor is Zhang Ze, the magistrate of Danyang County.</p>
<p>Candidates for Executive Committee and Section Chiefs Arrested One After Another: Xue Chengzong, Alternate Executive Committee Member of the Rugao County Party Department, Xue Fengluan, former General Affairs Section Chief of the County Public Security Bureau, Ji Zhanbei, former Executive Committee Member of the County Party Department, Chen Dufu, a teacher at the County Middle School, and Zhong Jieyuan and other six officials of the Agricultural Consolidation Association were arrested by former County Magistrate Liu Changyan the day before yesterday and sent to the local prison. Representatives from all walks of life went to bail them out, but they were not approved. The reason for the arrest has not yet been announced. Although Liu has left Ru, Xue and others have not yet been released. It is said that it will be resolved after the new leader comes to Ru.</p>
<p>Danyang</p>
<p>National Walking Group Arrives: Xie Fensheng and other six members of the National Walking Group arrived in the territory at 10:00 AM yesterday. The county government made proper arrangements to receive them and sent them to Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Zhang Schedules Inauguration: County Magistrate Zhang of this county was transferred to Rugao. He has now received an order from the department urging him to take up his new post. It is heard that County Magistrate Zhang has scheduled to take office on Friday, and all duties will be temporarily delegated to Secretary Yang.</p>
<p>River Dredging Committee Raises Funds: The dredging of the city river in this county is scheduled to start on the 15th. However, in terms of funding, in addition to the supplementary survey under the provincial water conservancy mu tax item, it is estimated that there is still a shortage of more than 20,000 yuan. The river dredging committee is now sending people to raise funds separately.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>Construction Bureau Officials Beaten: Regarding the case of officials of the Jiangdu Construction Bureau being beaten by road workers, it was recently heard that County Magistrate Chen plans to go to the countryside tomorrow to conduct an on-site investigation of everything, and plans to convene the general and sub-section chiefs of each section of the Yanghuo Road to instruct the workers to start work immediately. Regarding the food and accommodation level, according to the resolutions of the Second County Administrative Conference, each person will be issued a food and accommodation subsidy of one dime per day, and the Construction Bureau has long announced that it can be issued as soon as the department approves it. It is also heard that Director Wang of the Construction Department will return to Yangzhou today (the 18th) to visit his relatives and investigate the case. As for the injuries of the beaten personnel, it is heard that Director Wang and technician Zhou are not in serious condition, but technician Shen has not yet escaped danger.</p>
<p>Brothers Fighting Over Wife Leads to Cracking of Robbery Case: In Fanchuan Town, which borders the county and Gaoyou Tai County, there is a watchman, Chen Longzi. Half a year ago, a mother and daughter from Yancheng avoiding famine had nowhere to rely, and they begged from door to door during the day and stayed at Chen Longzi's house at night. Over time, Chen fell in love with the daughter of a refugee (18 years old). This spring, the mother wanted to take her daughter back to Yancheng, and Longzi agreed. Later, the girl's mother found out and demanded a lot of money. So Longzi made an appointment for ten days and agreed to find a way to marry her. Unexpectedly, after Longzi left, his daughter had an affair with Longzi's brother. When Longzi returned with the money, his lover was already owned by his brother. Longzi was furious, but Longzi not only refused to give in, but also sued the local merchants' association because his younger brother's money came from an unknown source. When Longzi heard the news, he disappeared. Later, Chen Mapi, who was an accomplice of Longzi in doing evil outside, was arrested and confessed that in the past six months, he had robbed Da Da Tong Yang Xiaolun and wealthy families in Taizhou Gaoyou, with more than 20 accomplices. The day before yesterday, Chen and Longzi robbed a family in Ximen, Tai County, and Chen Longzi divided more than 100 yuan to use for marrying a wife. In Chen Mapi's house, a pistol was found, along with 100 yuan and several pawn tickets. The water police team used a boat to send the above two people to Tai County. When the boat arrived at Laoyutao, bandit Zhou, was arrested and sent to the county together. Recently, it was heard that more than ten criminals have been arrested in this case. This can also be said to be the broad and inescapable net of heaven.</p>
<p>Qingjiang</p>
<p>Lianshui Plans Long-Distance Buses: Since the Jiangbei Highway Bureau stopped operating long-distance buses from Huaiyin to Lianshui, people in Lianshui felt that transportation was inconvenient and built two long-distance bus routes, Lianguan and Lianhuai. All the roads and bridges on the two routes have been repaired. It is heard that the vehicles were also approved by Gu Zhutong, commander of the Second Army of the Army, who donated two cars due to his relationship with his hometown, one for the south line and one for the north line, both on alternate days. As soon as the vehicles arrive in Lian, they will start business.</p>
<p>Huai'an Middle School Suspends Classes: Wang Zhongqi, principal of Jiangsu Provincial Huai'an Middle School, had resigned to the Education Department, and the department approved it. The department also appointed a new principal Chen to Huai to take over, scheduled for today (the 16th). However, the students and faculty of the school have a very close relationship with Wang, and they unanimously decided to suspend classes from the 15th. Representatives from both the faculty and students went to the province to petition that the handover could not be temporarily completed. If the petition is effective, of course there will be no problem, otherwise it is heard that all faculty members are prepared to resign en masse, vowing not to cooperate with Chen.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Removed and Loan Recalled: Wang Guodong, the magistrate of Huai'an County, was removed from office by the provincial government and officially handed over today, replaced by the new County Magistrate Wang Zhenyu. However, when Wang was the head of Huai'an, he lent a large sum of money to Huaiyin, 10,000 yuan for the military pay of the forty-ninth division. Now that he has left office, he has no choice but to urge Huaiyin to repay the debt. On the 15th, he sent his staff member Wei to guard and collect the money. The Huaiyin County Government and various agencies found it difficult to raise the huge amount of money in a short time. Yesterday, the county government convened representatives from various agencies to discuss ways to repay the money. As a result, three methods were agreed upon: (1) The representatives of various agencies present on the day jointly telegraphed the provincial government, ordering the Huai'an Customs and the Yangzhou Vehicle Tax Office to allocate the tax money collected to repay the military pay previously borrowed by the forty-ninth division from the local area; (2) The personnel who went to Huai'an to borrow money will still go to Huai'an to declare their responsibility to the various banks for raising the repayment; (3) Continue to collect the money from the households who have recognized but not yet paid the money, and the Huaiyin County Government will issue a receipt to avoid the abuses of floating collection. It is expected that if these steps are followed, the money will be paid off soon.</p>
<p>Jiashan</p>
<p>Detailed Account of the Yangjia Beach Robbery: Regarding the robbery in Yangjia Beach, Xiangfu Dang East, Xitang, yesterday, it is learned that most of the bandits are from Punan, with a total of more than 500 people and more than 30 bandit ships, flying flags embroidered with slogans. This time, a total of six civilian guns and silver and valuables were robbed from Yangjia Beach, and twelve meat tickets, including Xu Sanguan, were taken away. Among those who have not returned are Zhou Longsheng and five or six others. A woman surnamed Xu was forced to offer silver but failed, and a huge stone was added to her body, dying. Xu Yunzhen was also hung and beaten several times until he fainted. A young soybean curd shop girl from a certain surname in Yaozhuang Bridge, about to marry, was taken away by the bandits as the wife of the village. The girl's family is willing to redeem her with silver coins, but the bandits refuse. Yangjia Beach Village was shaken to a total loss of more than 20 civilian boats, with no exact report yet. Zhao Tingyu, the second district chief of the water police, happened to be on a shallow water ship to Xitang for inspection. When he got the news, he led the team to rush there, and the bandits fled to Henggang in the east, causing some disturbances. One branch fled to the Tiantian and Shangxiayun area, hoping to invade Xitang. Last night, there was news that a combined bandit ship from the three villages of the North Gang was heading to Fanbin New Town.</p>
<p>Pinghu</p>
<p>The Prelude to the Automobile Trip from Hangzhou to Zhapu: The Hangzhou-Zhapu Highway is scheduled to open to traffic on April 1. On the 16th, Su, the director of the Works Section of the Provincial Highway Bureau, Li, the director of the Design Section, and Shen Kuiliang, the engineer of the Hangping Section, and other eight people drove two sedan cars and arrived in Zhapu at 3:00 PM to inspect the bridges, and returned to the provincial capital at 5:00 PM, which took only three hours. The test drive ceremony is now scheduled for the 23rd.</p>
<p>Shanghai Class Ships Temporarily Suspended: Yesterday, all kinds of rumors suddenly broke out in the city, saying that the gang of bandits who robbed Xincang had the news of a large-scale robbery. The county government then announced special martial law. In order to avoid danger, all ships to Shanghai temporarily suspended sailing today. It is heard that one ship has already sailed and returned. Because Jinshan is adjacent to the countryside in Pinghu, it seems that bandits have been found. There was a small contact in Maokou last night, and the city is on high alert. Most of the military police were transferred to guard the east gate.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan</p>
<p>Director of the Finance Bureau and Staff Taken to Province: Regarding the arrest of Shen Changyi, Director of the Finance Bureau of Xiaoshan County, and staff members Miao Baoshan and Yu Huixian, the county government received a telegram from the province on the 15th, ordering Shen Changyi, Miao Baoshan, and Yu Huixian to be taken to the province immediately for verification and seizure. After receiving the telegram, the county government sent several police officers in the afternoon to take the three people to the province.</p>
<p>Former County Magistrate Zhao Pays Up the Outstanding Case Money: Zhao Qiang, the former magistrate of Xiaoshan County, still owed 5,020.98 yuan in the handover case and stated that there was still 2,632.674 yuan of silver to be submitted for the case. Yesterday, the Provincial Department of Finance ordered the former County Magistrate Zhao to pay 3,600 yuan.</p>
<p>Night Sailing Overturns and Two Drown: In Xixiao River in Xiaoshan, on the night of the 16th, a night boat from Shaocheng to Linpu overturned due to the rapid current and the rope breaking. All the goods were completely lost, and two boatmen drowned. The next morning, another boat salvaged the bodies, but there was no news yet.</p>
<p>Shangyu</p>
<p>Continued News of the Kidnapping Cases in Tangpu: Wu Yunting in Tangpu Street and Chen Guanshu's six-year-old son in Zhengyan Village, both in Shao, were kidnapped by five or six armed bandits at the same time a few days ago. It is now learned that residents of villages such as Xiaowu and Miaowan, in view of the previous incidents of Chen Guanshu's family, are planning to defend themselves and send strong men to guard strictly until late at night. At first, Wu Yunting was kidnapped on the way home from watching the opera in the town, but his family did not know. Later, when he did not return for several days, he suspected that he had quarreled at home because of trivial matters and ran away to Qi's house to avoid it. It was not until he received a letter from the bandits urging him to go to a certain place in Hangzhou to negotiate the ransom that he knew he had been kidnapped. It was also learned that Chen Guanshu received a letter from the bandits the day before yesterday, demanding 60,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Automobile Highway Expansion Route: Shao Cao Sheng Automobile Company recently plans to extend the route from Haoba to Shangpu. A board meeting was held a few days ago and it was decided to start surveying and measuring next month. After the surveying and measuring is completed, the bidding will start. The route is more than ten miles long and passes through Changshan, Zhangting, Hutou Temple, Meiwu, Qiutanling, Kunlun, and Dashan villages, and reaches Shangpu, where a station will be set up.</p>
<p>Ningbo</p>
<p>Young Woman Dies for Her Fiancé: Lu's eldest daughter, A Ming, 22 years old, at No. 4, Daifu, Lujia Fentou, Jiangbei Bank of Ningbo, is intelligent and has studied since childhood. She dropped out of school two years ago and learned needlework at home, working very diligently and loved by her parents. In January of this year, she was betrothed to Fu Jiemao of Wojia Lane, Jiangbei Bank, to be his second wife. The engagement was completed on the 18th of last month, and the wedding was scheduled for July of this year. Zhang was a staff member of the Bank of China in Hankou, but resigned last year and entered a certain gold shop in Shanghai. He returned to Ningbo three months ago to recuperate due to ill health. Unexpectedly, after arriving home, he passed away suddenly the day before yesterday (the 16th). A Ming cried all night after hearing the bad news, and was so sad that she wanted to die. After her parents, brothers and sisters tried to comfort her in every way, she pretended to restrain her grief. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 17th) at about 5:00 AM, she went out on the pretext of something and ran to Yongxing Liangmao Hang Lane, jumped into the river, and died. Her body floated to the Jiangmian of Fushiting, where it was spotted by someone and rescued by boat. She was already gasping for breath. Her parents, brothers and sisters rushed to the scene after hearing the news and took her to Huamei Hospital for treatment, but it was too late and she had died. A Ming's parents, because their daughter had died for her husband, planned to carry the coffin to the Qian house and bury it with her fiancé Zhang Jiemao to fulfill the wishes of the deceased.</p>

<h3>International Women's Basketball</h3>
<p>Federal Wins Against England... 34 to 23</p>
<p>United States Wins Against China... 34 to 12</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Women's Basketball Championship held two games yesterday starting at 6 PM in the Chinese Basketball Hall. As a result, the Federal team won against England 34 to 23, and the United States won against China 34 to 12.</p>
<h3>(1) Federal Wins Against the United States</h3>
<p>Both Teams Performed Well</p>
<p>Starting at six o'clock, Miss. Jie Hansheng of the Federal team was brave and skilled, a rare talent. At the start of the game, Miss Jie scored four consecutive goals, and the Federal team took an 8-0 lead. Afterwards, although England tried its best to attack, it was difficult to catch up. The first quarter was 9 to 5, the second quarter was even with 8 points each, the third quarter was 5 to 2, and the fourth quarter was 12 to 8, all in favor of the Federal team. The overall result was that the Federal team won 34 to 23. The referee was Mr. Smith. The performance of both teams was very agile and excellent.</p>
<h3>(2) United States Wins Against China</h3>
<p>The Chinese Team's Formation Was Disorganized</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese team's formation was disorganized, with no sense of cooperation. Moreover, each player was short and weak. Facing the tall and large American team was truly like striking a stone with an egg. The skill gap was vast. Shi Fuyi and Chen Xinyuan were the central defensive pillars, but their performance last night was also less agile than expected. The forwards, who usually pride themselves on their courage, became flustered when faced with such a strong opponent. Grabbing, dodging, and avoiding shots lacked their usual ease and experience. In addition, the entire team frequently committed fouls, giving the opponent counterattack opportunities. Compared to the initial games, their skills not only did not improve but seemed to have regressed. The American team's talent was evenly distributed, and their teamwork was far superior to China's. They were often able to seize opportunities and attack China's weaknesses, leading to a clear victory. In the initial exchanges, the United States took a high lead of 10 to 3 in the first quarter. They continued to lead in the second quarter with 10 to 2. In the third quarter, Chen Xinyuan was reassigned to center, scoring two goals in succession. However, Crier scored three consecutive goals for the opposing team. The fourth quarter was particularly intense. Three points were briefly scored, and Ms. Chen and Ms. Guo advanced together. In a short time, the opposing team scored another seven points, resulting in a final score of 34 to 12. The international team won. In the battle between England and the Federal team, both sides were evenly matched. However, in the last quarter, the agile English women reversed the situation and won with a score of 34 to 23.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Reception</h3>
<p>Chairman Niu hosted a banquet at the Education Bureau yesterday (19th) evening to entertain the referees and reporters of various newspapers for their hard work during this conference.</p>
<h3>China Prepares to Participate in the Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>Raising Departure Funds of 80,000, Excellent Results</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Japan and Lin Zhuguang Are Willing to Host</p>
<p>Reviewing New Sports Rules for Training</p>
<p>Training After the National Games Concludes</p>
<p>The upcoming Far Eastern Games, scheduled to be held in Tokyo, Japan, on May 24th, have prompted active preparations in various provinces and cities across China. Outstanding talents are being selected and strong teams are being formed, ready to compete against the heroes of the three islands and the skilled athletes of the Philippines. Consequently, the buzz surrounding sports events has been shaking the nation, filled with vigor and excitement, marking an unprecedented prosperous scene in the Republic of China's history. It is indeed a good omen for the future of sports in our country. The progress of preparations to participate in the Far Eastern Games has been reported in several newspapers. Now, the most recent updates are explored below:</p>
<h3>Economic Aspects</h3>
<p>The most crucial issue for participating in the Far Eastern Games is finance. The China National Amateur Athletic Federation, responsible for this task, focused on this matter from the beginning. A detailed budget was prepared, totaling at least 80,000 or more. Although Chairman Jiang of the National Government generously donated 40,000 yuan (20,000 yuan has been allocated to Hao Boyang, a key member of the Federation), a significant shortfall remains. Therefore, the Federation has sent letters and telegrams to prominent figures in the country and enthusiastic sports supporters among overseas Chinese, inviting them to assist with fundraising. Economic directors from various sectors both domestically and abroad were appointed to solicit donations, hoping to gather enough to support this grand undertaking. It is reported that favorable responses have been received from various locations, with quite good results.</p>
<h3>Hospitality</h3>
<p>There are numerous Chinese compatriots traveling to Japan for business. At each Far Eastern Games held in Japan, they generously contribute funds to organize large-scale reception venues to welcome fellow athletes, showing their patriotic enthusiasm that truly inspires endless admiration. The upcoming games will again be held in Tokyo. The Federation has sent letters requesting Ambassador Wang Rongbao in Japan, as well as the Chinese Associations in Tokyo, Kobe, Osaka, and other locations, to handle hospitality matters. It is reported that wealthy merchants among overseas Chinese have readily assumed responsibility, forming reception committees to prepare for a grand welcome at the time.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Mr. Lin Zhuguang, a wealthy businessman from Luzon, Philippines, is one of the key economic directors of the Federation. He is currently overseas, soliciting substantial donations to provide financial support. During the 7th Far Eastern Games held in the Philippines, Mr. Lin spent tens of thousands on hosting the Chinese athletes, bringing glory to the country. This time, he will also do his best to assist the Federation and support this grand event, planning to return to China on the 4th to accompany the athletes to Japan.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>The rules of various sports in the Far Eastern Games inevitably change with trends. Therefore, the Federation has hired top domestic sports experts to review the suitability of various sports rules and establish standards for future athlete training, in preparation for on-site competitions.</p>
<h3>Training Aspects</h3>
<p>The day the Hangzhou National Games conclude will be the time when the representatives for our China Far Eastern Games are selected. There will still be more than a month until the opening of the Games, allowing ample time for the athletes to practice thoroughly. Therefore, the issues of guidance and management for the athletes before their departure are extremely important. It is heard that the Association authorities are currently in the process of finding suitable housing for the athletes to stay in. At that time, they will hire specialized personnel with profound knowledge and rich experience to take on the responsibility of providing guidance. Regarding management matters, they advocate for strict enforcement in order to conserve energy and build strength, and to enhance national glory.</p>

<h3>One Man's Opinion</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>If there were no cosmetics in the world, at least one-third of the young men and women worldwide would be saved.</p>
<p>If the emotional energy spent between men and women were instead focused on saving the nation and the party, then revolutionary success could be achieved imminently.</p>
<p>If women absolutely could not reproduce, then women's rights in the world would be higher than anything else.</p>
<p>Men look down on women, while women look up to men.</p>
<p>A man views his newlywed wife like a newly tailored Western suit.</p>
<p>The heart awaiting a lover's rendezvous is like the heart of a sentry on the front lines.</p>
<p>A virgin's heart is a spiderweb. A man is a dragonfly.</p>
<p>If the footprints a lover leaves on the ground could be collected, then someone would surely lie on the ground and pick them up step by step. Listening to a lover's voice is more attentive than hearing the sound of an ant crawling on the ground.</p>
<p>A man thinks he has made her his plaything, just as a woman thinks she has made him her plaything. In the same way, they unknowingly play with each other, and each believes themselves to be the victor.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Physical Educationist Wei Xudong</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Mr. Wei Xudong was a native of Hunan. He initially served in the military, earning a reputation for his bravery and skill in battle. Later, he retired from the army and enjoyed traveling through mountains and rivers in straw sandals. He admired the wonders of Tiger Hill and Lingyan Temple in Suzhou, lingering for a long time, seemingly forgetting his home. Dongwu University, the highest institution of learning in Suzhou, and Caoqiao Middle School then hired him to teach military science and physical education. Mr. Wei, having come from a military background, was not highly literate. When teaching military science, he often mispronounced words in the lecture notes. However, his reasoning was exceptionally clear, his experience exceptionally rich, and his witty remarks were constant. His mistakes were overlooked. Mr. Wei was skilled in the use of the iron bar. He could lift a large cauldron on the bar, again and again, eventually swinging his body around it. The iron bar, as thick as a child's arm, would bend, yet Mr. Wei would not even pant or sweat. When teaching military drills, he often led the team to the suburbs. When it rained heavily, some students would hesitate and try to avoid it. Mr. Wei would immediately scold them, saying, "If a man does not first forge and temper his body, how will he become a pillar of the nation in the future?" The students, hearing this, would feel emboldened, braced themselves, and battled the rain. Their bodies would be drenched, but they became accustomed to it. The people of Suzhou were generally weak, and the customs changed as a result. Mr. Wei was also skilled in shooting. During his free time on Sundays, he often went out with a hunting gun. Even if the birds flew high, Mr. Wei never missed. In the slanting rays of the setting sun, one could see spotted doves and pheasants hanging on the end of his gun. Then, Mr. Wei would return home. Mr. Wei also enjoyed riding donkeys. When riding swiftly, he would leap off the saddle in a single bound, leaving the donkey to wander freely. Then, he would chase after it and, just as the donkey was running, Mr. Wei would already be sitting on top of it again. However, the donkey's strength was limited and it often became exhausted as a result. The donkey driver would not allow it, so Mr. Wei would double his payment. One day, Mr. Wei went to Tiger Hill with his students. He saw a beggar catching snakes. Mr. Wei gave him money to release the snake. The snake quickly disappeared into the grass. Mr. Wei then paid the beggar to chase after it again. After it was caught, he released it again. Releasing it and chasing it again, Mr. Wei found it amusing. He enjoyed playing around in this way. One day, a former student asked a famous calligrapher who taught Chinese to write a couplet. Mr. Wei saw it, snatched it away, and offered himself instead. The students thought that the couplet was doomed, that it would just be scribbled on and used as scrap paper. Unexpectedly, Mr. Wei dipped his brush in ink and completed it in a moment. The strokes were bold and upright, resembling the Northern Wei style. The students were greatly surprised and impressed. It turned out that Mr. Wei had been secretly studying calligraphy from stone tablets for a long time, but he had kept it a secret and had not revealed it before. From then on, he received more and more requests for his calligraphy. Mr. Wei was unable to respond to them all, so he set a fee to limit the requests. Mr. Wei also served as the commander of the merchant militia for several years. Therefore, even women and children knew his great name. Since I took up residence in Shanghai, I have not heard about Mr. Wei's condition for a long time. Yesterday, my schoolmate Wang Ziqing came to visit and said that Mr. Wei had become very depressed due to some event. He indulged in alcohol and women to distract himself, fell ill, and returned to Hunan. He has now passed away. It is a pity.</p>
<h3>A Visit to Liu and Zhang's Wedding</h3>
<p>— Wang Meiju</p>
<p>On March 16th, Ms. Zhang Shiyi, the daughter of the respected elder Mr. Zhang Yishan, and Mr. Liu Hairuo, the younger brother of the famous painter Liu Haisu and a teacher at the Shanghai Fine Arts School, held their wedding ceremony at the Central Hotel on Wuma Road. Meiju has always admired Mr. Zhang Yishan as a teacher, and Ms. Zhang Shiqiu's younger sister, Shizhao, once sought calligraphy lessons from me. Therefore, I was able to attend and observe the grand ceremony. In my opinion, purely old-style weddings are no longer seen today. Civilized or semi-civilized styles are seen intermittently. Today's Liu-Zhang wedding cannot be separated from civilization, and the harmony in the hall, with both new and old elements, made the couple even more beautiful. Therefore, I am happy to record it.</p>
<p>The Truth of Perfect Beauty Ms. Zhang Shiqiu is a talented student at the Shanghai Fine Arts School. It is said that Mr. Hairuo and Ms. Shiqiu were classmates who became teachers and students, and then went from teachers and students to becoming husband and wife. This is the source of perfect beauty. Hairuo's appearance is majestic and spirited, with none of the frivolousness of worldly young men. Shiqiu, on the other hand, is dignified and graceful. They walked side by side during the ceremony, calm and composed, and their strength and gracefulness complemented each other. Can this not be called the truth of perfect beauty?</p>
<p>The Lady's Knowledge of Propriety Mrs. Zhang has many children. She has assisted Mr. Yishan in managing the household affairs and educating the children for a long time, and has a long-standing reputation. On this day, Mr. Yishan had just recovered from a minor illness and was unable to personally preside over the ceremony. Mrs. Zhang expressed her apologies and gratitude to the guests in a humble and respectful manner, which moved those who heard it. My female disciple, Zhang Shizhao, walked back and forth, carefully considering everything. Her filial piety was evident in her eyebrows. With parents like these, it is fitting that they have such a daughter.</p>
<p>The Variety of Guests On this day, the male and female guests were diverse and colorful. Mr. Yishan is a respected elder, so there were scholars with both age and virtue. Ms. Zhang Shiqiu is a talented student at the Shanghai Fine Arts School, so there were young people with unique attire. Among the virtuous men, Mr. Yu Zhaokang was the oldest, arriving with a cane, his beard and eyebrows faintly exuding a Taoist aura. Mr. Qu Wenliu is also a famous figure of the Republic of China, attending because of local friendship. Many of the female guests were from old-fashioned families, and their conversations were elegant. It is a pity that Meiju is neither new nor old, and felt a bit out of place among them.</p>
<p>The Amusing Words at the Feast The guests entered the banquet at six o'clock. The female guests were seated in the east corner, and the male guests were seated in the west. One guest joked, "The women's circle is not just seeking equality with the men's circle." The words were quite amusing. A moment later, the newlywed couple gracefully arrived and offered wine to each table. Everyone accepted and drank, daring not to refuse. The second table on the west seemed to be occupied by Hairuo's classmates. Hairuo then went to another person and socialized with this table. One guest at the table forced Hairuo to play the finger-guessing game. Hairuo declined, asking the guest to represent him. The guest said, "Can finger-guessing be represented? Can everything you are doing today also be represented by me?" Everyone laughed, and Hairuo dared not refuse again. What amusing words!</p>
<p>Seeing Little and Wondering Much A congratulatory banner had the four characters "Yi Qi Zhou Jia" (宜其州家). I asked people but they all said they did not know. I asked Shizhao, and Shizhao said, "The gold characters are in a box, and that's what's written on the box." As I was about to enter the banquet, Meiju was still troubled by these four characters, like a bone stuck in my throat. I hurried to ask Mr. Wang and his well-spoken wife, hoping to gain some insight, but the two were busy hosting the female guests, so I did not ask. There is no shortage of erudite people in the world, and they must laugh at my seeing little and wondering much.</p>
<h3>New Talk on Swindling</h3>
<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place where people from all directions gather, so there are especially many bizarre things. Recently, my friend encountered a swindling case, which was also quite interesting. I'm writing it out for you all to see, so you can avoid being deceived.</p>
<p>One night, my friend Mr. C was sitting in his study. Suddenly, a middle-aged man came in, dressed neatly and not resembling a low-class person. He was also very respectful. Although Mr. C was surprised because he didn't know him, he had to exchange a few pleasantries with him. Listening to his accent, it was clearly from the same hometown. He also admitted that he lived not far from Mr. C's house. He said that he had been away for many years and had always been living in the army. He was currently a battalion commander under a certain military commander and would be leaving soon. He used to be very familiar with Mr. C's father in the South, and he even described Mr. C's father's situation at the time, the family situation, and even his personality in detail. Mr. C thought that he was an old friend of his father, so of course he didn't dare to neglect him and treated him sincerely. Who knew that after talking for a while, he suddenly took out two pawn tickets, one for seven yuan and one for thirteen yuan. He said that because he had been staying in Shanghai for a long time, life was very difficult. As soon as the weather cleared up, he had to put his robe in the pawn shop. How could he meet people in short clothes (he was wearing a raincoat when he came)? So now he was willing to pledge one seven-yuan pawn ticket to you for nine yuan, so that he could redeem his robe. This seven-yuan pawn ticket was for a brand new Western suit, worth at least thirty yuan. You can redeem it. Mr. C thought that he was in dire straits and was also a friend of his father in the past, so of course he lent him the money. So he gave him nine yuan and immediately wrote a letter to tell his father. Who knew that three days later, his father replied, saying that this person was a rascal, specializing in swindling. He had previously swindled him out of two yuan. Only then did Mr. C realize that he had been scammed. But it was too late to regret. Later, Mr. C met many relatives and friends, who all said that they had been scammed by this person, and that he had borrowed in Mr. C's name. As for that pawn ticket, Mr. C was afraid of causing more trouble, so he didn't want to redeem it.</p>
<p>After hearing this, I couldn't help but have some thoughts. Just imagine these swindlers, who have a good appearance and good eloquence. Why do they fall to such a state? Who is to blame? What led to this? It really makes me feel infinitely emotional.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (152)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 9: The Celebrities Make a Racket Playing Hide-and-Seek, A Beautiful Woman Willfully Provides Support</p>
<p>It can be seen that the playful games also followed the national system. In that Chinese national system, before the reforms to democracy, the flower world also used the imperial system. Therefore, there were titles like Pheasant King and Me King. Later, after the group republic, those gentlemen who joked and wrote started what they called the Flower World Election. At that time, there was no longer the feminine air of the Great King, so they elected what they called the Flower World President. For a time, Shanghai had several Flower World Presidents, all of whom were in the limelight. Even the brothels in Hangzhou and Suzhou followed suit. This is a later story. Now, let me say that in addition to the Me King, there was also a tall and elegant woman, with the air of a tall and beautiful woman. Do you know who she is? Her name was Hongbing Xiaoxie. This was highly appreciated by Shi Guanping. Originally, most women were short and small, especially the so-called beauties. Those who praised them called them petite and exquisite. Indeed, large women did not qualify as beauties. But the appearance of a short, fat person was also disgusting. Tall and elegant was indeed desirable. As long as she was not too thin. Thin and tall was like a bamboo pole. It had to be well-proportioned. It was like writing characters. It was just that being plump and smooth was better. Hongbing Xiaoxie was one of those who were plump and smooth. In short, she was a beautiful woman with a healthy body. Today, she also came to see the horse races and take pictures. The Mingjing Club was lively enough with this group of people. With the addition of Yan Yichen, Zheng Yanxiu, Shi Guanping, and Zuo Shichen, who often came here, the horse races were naturally more comfortable and pleasant than the stands on the racecourse side of Ma Huo Road. At that time, along Jing'an Temple Road around the racetrack, I don't know where all these people came from. They used long benches and wooden planks to build platforms. Chairs were set up on the platforms. If someone wanted to watch the horse races from their platforms, they had to pay a certain fee. Generally, people from the upper classes who came to watch the horse races hired carriages. The carriages were also decorated with ribbons. Because there were still very few cars at that time. Some also booked large dining rooms, such as Yipinxiang, and brought their wives, daughters, and concubines to enjoy the distant view. Those who sat on the wooden platforms were some villagers from the surrounding areas of Shanghai, such as Pudong, Jiangwan, Minhang, and Yinxiang Port. There were also some small family daughters. Because during the horse racing season, factories were closed and customs were sealed. Those silk factory workers and yarn workers, as well as many shopkeepers, called their aunts and sisters, also had to enjoy themselves in time. Sometimes, there were too many people on the platforms. With a loud crash, the platform collapsed, causing everyone to applaud and cheer. Fortunately, the platform was not built high, so it was not enough to injure people. However, it was common for people to fall down. It was nothing to be surprised about.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Nanyang (12)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Many families in Guangdong also worship Guan Gong. Now, most of them have changed to hanging portraits of Sun Yat-sen. This is because of the expansion of nationalism.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the self-governing organizations of our overseas Chinese in Annam are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Associations: Fujian Association, Guangzhou Zhao Association, Hakka Association, Chaozhou Association, others,</p>
<p>General Chamber of Commerce (2) Occupation: Rice Merchants, Medicine Merchants, Agriculture, Industry, Education, Newspaper Offices,</p>
<p>(3) Social Organizations: 1. Newspaper Offices, 2. Bookstores, 3. Schools, 4. Private Schools, 5. Religions (Buddhism, Christianity), 6. Sports, 7. Fine Arts, 8. Music. The above are just a few things I have heard and seen. However, I sincerely hope that they will connect and help each other, and study in depth the academic knowledge of self-government, in order to seek survival and evolution.</p>
<p>In recent days, various newspapers have reported that Annamese soldiers in the Northern Territory rebelled and injured two French military officers. The French government has also allowed the publication. These are all translated from French newspapers. Now that Japan in the East has risen, and Siam is an independent country, the independence of the Philippines will soon be successful. India, Burma, and Annam all want autonomy. It is not difficult to imagine the future of Nanyang. Last year, when I was in Nanning, Guangxi, there was an old man who had fought in the Sino-French War in the late Qing Dynasty. He still spoke with enthusiasm and stroked his palms about his success in defeating the French. Annam is close to Guangxi and Yunnan. If the country is unified, the communication between overseas Chinese will also be very easy to handle. Alas, I earnestly hope for peace and unification within the country.</p>
<p>The climate in Saigon is usually 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Now is the time to eat watermelons, which are not very large, but are sweet.</p>
<p>Annam is located between 7 degrees and 23 degrees north latitude. It is 3,000 miles long from north to south and 1,200 miles wide from east to west. It is closely connected to Qinlian in Guangdong, Longzhou in Guangxi, and Mengzi in Yunnan. It faces Hainan Island across a stretch of water. The land is fertile and the people are simple and honest. Rice is harvested twice a year. The relationship between China and Annam is close. Guangdong is like Fengtian, while Guangxi and Cochin are like Jilin and Heilongjiang. Its historical relationship dates back to the time of Tang and Yu, when Yuechang had already translated and came to pay tribute to the white pheasant. The Qin Dynasty established the Lin Yi Prefecture and moved people there. The Han Dynasty established the Jiaozhi, Jiuzhen, and Rinan Prefectures. It was not a foreign vassal state, but a prefecture and county.</p>
<p>In the Sino-French Treaty of Guangxu Eleventh Year, China recognized Vietnam as a French protectorate. The political relationship between the two countries was severed.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Gleanings</h3>
<p>— Tang Bihua</p>
<p>When taking clothes to the laundry for washing, first search the pockets for money and important items. This is a very ordinary thing, but I have been tricked several times.</p>
<p>It is best to go to the same store to inquire about prices. The so-called "compare goods from three stores and you won't suffer a loss" is what this means.</p>
<p>When getting into a rickshaw, first memorize the number on the magnetic plate. In case you lose something in the car, you can report it to the police. It can be found immediately, and there is no case of it not being returned. When getting a haircut at the barbershop, do not ask the barber to clean your ears, do your eyes, or massage your back. Not only is it unhygienic, but it will also cost you more in tips.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Market Price Increase Weakens Slightly</h3>
<p>Previously, it rose and fell, hovering around the 500 mark. Yesterday, the gold market saw initial gains followed by declines. Dealers' sentiments were unsettled, with varying demands and supplies. Market prices fluctuated by about four taels compared to the previous session. Trading within the market was still relatively active. Companies like Yuan Mao Yong and Chang Sheng Yong were actively buying, while Wan Xing, Shun Li, Yu Da, and Yu Fa Yong had strong selling pressure. The foreign exchange market initially strengthened but later eased, with the "big bars" (large silver ingots) slightly contracting. Consequently, prices initially rose slightly, but due to a surge in buyers, prices soared, briefly exceeding the 505 tael mark. Later, buying interest waned, and bulls took the opportunity to sell, leading to a sharp drop of four taels. However, there were occasional undercurrents, with fluctuations of one or two taels. The market ended with only slight fluctuations of two taels. Yu Da, Yuan Mao Yong, and Xie Yu all sold, while buyers were scarce, leading to a break below 500 taels, followed by a rebound of one or two taels, hovering around 501 taels. There were no significant booms or busts. Due to it being Wednesday, the foreign exchange market was sluggish.</p>
<p>Morning Surge, Sudden Drop Before Closing. Yesterday, the recent British silver bar slightly decreased by 1/16, the forward price remained unchanged, and the silver price decreased by 1/8. The May gold standard opened at 501 taels and 8 mace, a 3 mace increase compared to the day before. The gross price jumped to 504 taels and 9 mace, due to large buyers, tightening the exchange rate. Transactions included the sale of next month's Japanese gold at 1 tael and 5.75 fen, and Sumitomo and Tsutsumi mutually trading May British gold at 11 pence and 1.125 farthings. The initial price listed did not change but then there was selling pressure, declining to 503 taels and 1 mace, with subsequent increases of 5-6 mace. Some speculators sold and Mitsui sold May British gold at 11 pence and 1.125 farthings, while industrial and commercial firms bought July British gold at 11 pence and 2.25 farthings. Shanghai sold June Japanese gold at 1 tael, 4.875 fen, causing prices to fall to 501 taels and 4.5 mace. Afterwards, Mitsui and Shanghai mutually traded next month British gold at 11 pence and 1.1875 farthings. Mitsui bought recent Japanese gold at 1 tael and 5 fen. Retail investors and hedgers bought gradually pushing the price up by 1 tael. By 10:30 it was 3 taels and 6.7 mace. Afterwards, Yu Da, Fu Yong, Wan Xing, and Yi Yu and others actively sold, weakening the exchange rate. Banks bought forward Japanese gold at 1 tael and 4.375 fen, and British gold at 11 pence and 2.125 farthings, shifting the market from strong to weak, with a sudden drop of 1 tael. By 11:30 it was at 500 taels and 0.09 mace, with a slight rise of a few mace, eventually closing at 501 taels and 7 mace by noon.</p>
<p>Xu Market, Only Slight Fluctuation of One Taels. The market opened in the afternoon at 501 taels and 1 mace. Afterwards, large firms inclined to sell, reducing the price by about 2 taels at one point, reaching only 499 taels and a half. After that, hedgers and Yuan Heng and others bought, pushing the price back up by over 2 taels, reaching 502 taels at 3:00. Again retail investors sold, suppressing the price again slightly over 1 tael, reaching 500 taels and 0.03 mace at 4:00. The exchange rate market was quiet because it was Tuesday. The market closed at 4:30 at 500 taels and 0.09 mace, a decrease of 6 mace compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Lower than the Huai Bank by 15-16 Taels. The highest price on the 1st was 504 taels and 9 mace, and the lowest price was 499 taels and 5 mace, a difference of 5 taels and 4 mace. The listed price was 517 taels and 8 mace, smaller by 14-15 taels. The noon price and water compensation totaled 502 taels, and the afternoon water compensation was 501 taels.

<h3>Current Silver Dollar Sales Still Have Lizi Price Stagnation</h3>
<p>Market Overview: For days the silver dollar need has not been strong, and client sales are not lonely, and so market momentum is not facing major price decreases. Yesterday's situation was tired, but people are still waiting, and the supply and need of silver is in a difficult and uncertain trend. At this point of difficulty, it is not possible to seek for prices to be raised, nor is it possible to achieve lower prices. In short, since the Qian industry was affected by the Yuda firm, the future development of business will definitely not be the same as in previous years.</p>
<p>Lizi Split Prices: (Silver Dollar Lizi) Because people were keeping a reasonable, not competitive level of demand on the market, the result was that the price was the same: seven qian, two fen, zero hao, one hu, and two si and a half for the noon market. This was a tiny decrease of one hao, two hu, and a half when compared to the noon market of the previous day. (Silver Split) Although split notes transactions have started, the good news is that only the Japanese are slowly developing this market. As such, the possibility that the Silver Split will raise and be expensive does not exist. Yesterday, the early market started at five fen, and the noon market at four fen, a little less than the one or two fen that the previous day was doing. The heads were raised, and the waters were added, and transactions of two and three fen were happening.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: Southern small silver dollars, market situation stagnant and weak. Both the early and noon market prices are six qian, one fen, and six li. This is a two li decrease when compared to the noon price of the previous day. Early transactions of 4000 jiao, and noon of 1000 jiao. The Guandong small silver dollar, the early and noon price was five qian, nine fen, six li, and seven hao and a half, and made 150,000 jiao in early market and 30,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins fell another 2,000 wen to 390,000 wen and made 28-29,000 strings of transactions.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar In and Out: (Silver money) Because yesterday was Wednesday, bank foreign exchanges were normally weak, and as such, various receipts and releases were simple. Chinese merchants had roughly 2 million in receipts and releases. Foreign merchants had more than 1 million. There were roughly 8 million in various goods, exchange tax, and telegram exchange receipts and releases. There were 500,000+ in raw silk being released, and 1.1 million being stored. Japanese merchants had 3 million in receipts and releases and 700,000 being released. Silver money firms and the gongs had more than 26 million in receipts and releases, 2.5-6 million in extra-charge receipts and releases, and more than 1.2 million in receipts and releases from various roads. Roughly 450,000 in cash money released. (Foreign Money) Early market had 735,000 made in drafts and money transfers and a made of 885,000 in the noon market. The morning paper money was 30,000, and 5,000 in the afternoon. Outside the market there was 97,000 in the morning and 113,000 in the noon market. 105,000 in cash dollar for both markets. Bank transactions were inter-firm trades of 600,000 in the morning and 500,000 in the noon market. 1.1 million in bank foreign accounts receipt and release and 2 million in paper money receipts and releases.

Out of town firms purchased and裝 cash foreign dollars and new money of 3-400,000 and there are no heard of sources for this.</p>
<h3>New News of this Year's Foreign Dollar</h3>
<p>There is normally a period of selling for late March and mid-April in which the deals and amounts are very large. But since the stop deals of last year, sometimes secret deals were made. But this year, there is no secret deal. According to news from industry, a raw silk foreign firm wished to pre-purchase late-April (around the end of March and the beginning of April) of the Gregorian calendar from a Qian firm. There were several millions of potential purchases and they wanted to pay a high price of 7 qian, 2 fen, and 2 li and a half. As a result, the supplier didn't want to, and no deal was made. It's heard that the Qian firm side guessed that that the price would go above that at the time and so it didn't want to. If the purchasing party was willing to pay 7 qian, 2 fen and 5 li, then possibly 1-2 million could be traded. However, even this cannot be fully supplied. From this it can be known how hard it is to do secret deals this year and it is determined that there are no major deals.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Fails to Recover</h3>
<p>Actual Sales Stagnant, Turning Quiet</p>
<p>Sellers' Suppression Particularly Strong</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. The overall trend remains sluggish, and most people are psychologically tired, searching the market for spot yarn for delivery. With this phenomenon, people's confidence weakens. However, overseas cotton yarn market conditions have consistently risen. The yarn market is currently difficult to predict due to the poor situation and sellers' suppression.</p>
<p>People's Standard Initially Rises, Ends Weakly: The people's standard market opened in the morning with a sudden increase of 50 points in US cotton, leading to good sentiment. Retail investors actively covered short positions, with large order volumes, resulting in a favorable situation. Each month increased by 7-8 qian, with slight retracements in February and March. In the end, each month increased by 3, 4, and 5 qian. In the afternoon, rumors about the situation spread, actual sales were weak, and sellers suppressed the market, causing a sudden drop of nearly 53 qian in the near term and 56 qian in the long term. The total transaction volume for the day was 13,150 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>People's Standard Closing Price Changes and Open Interest: Closing Price Changes and Open Interest</p>
<p>March 1545 down 2, 28,950 June 1520 up 2, 24,000</p>

<p>May 1523 up 1, 32,600 August 1519 up 2, 15,500</p>
<p>Spot Demand Even Quieter: Spot yarn sales were slightly quieter. Statistics show that each guild purchased a total of 830 bales, and fellow traders entered 1,360 bales. Market conditions were flat. Qingdao had the strongest interest in importing, accounting for 150 bales. In addition, Wuhu had 100 bales, Niuzhuang 45 bales, Sichuan 20 bales, Shantou 110 bales, Luzhou 45 bales, Anqing 45 bales, Tianjin 55 bales, inland areas 150 bales, Yantai 30 bales, Xuzhou 20 bales, and miscellaneous guilds 60 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Will Follow Overseas Markets and Rise</h3>
<p>US Cotton Recovers by 50 Pounds</p>
<p>Chinese Standard Short Covering Suddenly Becomes Popular</p>
<p>The cotton market is experiencing a sharp rise, mainly because the US cotton market is increasingly bullish, and retail investors are covering short positions, resulting in a sudden surge in popularity. Chinese guilds are also tightening their grip and refusing to release supply. Delivery for this month is particularly scarce, so the market is very firm. The future of the cotton market is still bullish with no signs of a decline.</p>
<p>Futures Cotton Rises Sharply by 4 Qian: The Chinese standard market opened in the morning with an increase in both US and Indian cotton, leading to active buying in the market and a particularly firm situation. Each month increased by 2.5 to 4.5 qian. The market remained firm in the afternoon, with near-term prices remaining flat and mid-term prices fluctuating between 0.05. 36,300 dan were traded in March. The closing prices for the Chinese standard market are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>Grain: White Rice Reaches 20 Yuan</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, only a dozen ships arrived from various routes. The market was extremely active. Common white rice from Changbang rose sharply by about two jiao. Medium-grade northern rice also increased by 1.5 to 2.5 jiao. The market price for specially high-grade rice was 19 yuan and 9.5 jiao, reaching the 20 yuan mark. This price can be called a groundbreaking new record. If the weather turns overcast, prices may continue to rise. Thin rice arrivals were scarce and sales were flat. Yangdu indica rice, due to frequent increases in foreign prices, attracted attention from shopkeepers, and prices rose by one to two jiao. Various indica rice from other ports were particularly attractive because customers from inland routes were actively purchasing, and arrivals at Shanghai port were scarce. Retail sales were competitive, and merchants were bartering and selling, keeping the market tight. Changing to cash made the local market feel refreshed, and the trend was lively, with prices rising nearly a jiao.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Arrivals from the river area were not strong, and the sales market continued to be active. Common japonica rice from Suzhou, Tongcheng, and other areas was experiencing fewer sources due to special customers in inland production areas purchasing and hoarding, leading to daily increases in quoted prices. Shanghai merchants, who had to transport the rice from further away, faced increased costs and firmly held onto higher prices, pushing the market higher and higher. Yesterday, prices rose sharply by another 1.5 jiao. Ordinary high-grade rice in this area was also above the 19 yuan mark. Thin early rice such as Qingjiao from southern areas gradually gained attention from shops, as rice prices were still at a relatively low level, making purchases attractive. Prices rose by about a jiao. Arrivals of Yangdu indica rice were light, and rural sales were very strong, leading to demand exceeding supply. In addition, frequent increases in Saigon small rice also contributed to the rise of local indica rice by 1.5 jiao. White rice showed slight continued strength, but sales were not active.</p>
<h3>Flour Price: Recently 5 Qian Entering Customs</h3>
<p>A Certain Factory Sells 40-50 Thousand Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the flour market opened in the morning, the quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly better, and people's sentiment was quite stable. However, there were signs of unrest in the situation, and merchants inevitably became cautious. At that time, a certain factory was selling well for March and April, estimated to be between 40-50 thousand bags. As a result, people's sentiment was very weak in the near-term months, and April was entering customs at 5 qian. When the market opened in the afternoon, the price for this month once fell to 2 taels and 5 qian. Later, Tianjin merchants slightly increased their purchases, and Hankou also slightly covered their short positions, so the market recovered and stabilized. The prices for other months were generally hovering. Considering the future steps, if the north is not stable, the future of the flour market may be impacted. As a result, the prices for March, April, and May were each 7.5 li lower than the previous day, the price for June was unchanged, and the prices for July and August were each 2.5 li lower.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat: Mixed Increases and Decreases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, there were mixed increases and decreases in the prices for various months. The price for this month was high because the delivery date was approaching, and although short sellers had physical goods, only half of them met the standards of the exchange. Therefore, sellers who did not meet the standards had to cover their positions, which is why the market price increased. The sentiment for new wheat in various months was very good, and buying was strong, leading to a sudden surge in the market. As a result, the price for this month was 4 fen higher than the previous month, the price for April was 1 fen lower, the price for June was 2 fen higher, the price for July was 1 fen higher, and the price for August was 2 fen higher. In the spot market, high-quality goods were rarely seen for delivery, and medium and low-quality wheat dominated. Wheat from Kainan and Suxiu was 5 taels and 7 fen, and wheat from Jiangxi was 4 taels, 6 qian, 3 fen to 4 qian, with a total of 1,200 bags purchased by Fufeng.</p>
<h3>Futures Foreign Rice Soars Unceasingly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, futures foreign rice was even more remarkably popular, rising more than 1 qian compared to the previous day. Rice from the Lu route rose by nearly 2 jiao, and spot prices also rose by 1 jiao. The reason for the increase was that foreign firms were still selling, and there were rumors of an incident in the Raikong area, making it impossible to pre-sell in the future. Another part of the foreign firms settled prices with Shanghai merchants, and people unanimously expected the market to improve, leading to a surge in futures prices. The market sold 3,000 bags of number 1 Saigon rice, 2,000 bags of number 3 rice, and 1,000 bags of Qiafo rice in total, and more than 30,000 bags of futures were sold, all of which were covering positions.</p>
<h3>Broadcloth Fine Serge Sales Suddenly Active</h3>
<p>This Factory's Cotton Cloth: The trend is softening, because the situation is tense, actual sales are waiting to see, and inventories are gradually increasing, leading to weak sentiment. The price of coarse cloth is falling more sharply because the routes to various ports in the north have suddenly stopped, and there is no sign of excitement in the Yangtze River basin. Yesterday, 13, 11, and 9-pound goods all fell by 2 fen. Yihuo bleached cloth also fell by 2.5 fen. Coarse twill from Shaanxi has stopped being purchased. However, because the routes for dyed cloth are smooth, the demand for fine cloth is still greater than the supply, but there are more spot goods, so the price has not changed. Among the foreign merchants' sales routes, Xiamen merchants purchased 50 pieces of double eagle coarse cloth, and Ningbo merchants sold more than 100 pieces of 9-pound coarse cloth and Blue Chicken fine cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Broadcloth: The market situation is chaotic. Fine serge from the east, which has been falling for a long time, showed signs of a turnaround yesterday. Fellow traders on this street sold more than 500 pieces, because the prices of all brands have fallen to the bottom, and the prices must be 1 fen higher, attracting the attention of buyers. Yesterday, all of the colored and gray goods from the Huxinting were sold out, and the market price suddenly rose by 2.5 li. Colorful goods from Tucai were 2 qian, 3 fen, and colorful goods were 2 qian, 2 fen, and 7.5 li, the same price as Joy. The price of printed cloth is trending downward. The color of the blue strip dingle went on the peaceful wheel and运去 100 more items to Chuan state. Previously out of stock white thickness 法绒 has arrived in Hu. 达磨lion is sold at 2 qian, 3 fen, and 7 li, and 富华 is sold at 2 qian and 3 fen. There are many 西货 seven serge in the market. The abundance and wealth of goods</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Three Cars of Red Dates Unloaded</h3>
<p>Prices Range from 6.5 to 7.3 Taels</p>
<p>Recently, various shipments of mixed-grade red dates have been arriving. Yesterday, it was reported that a merchant from Zhenbang opened a batch of 600 packages of Hao red dates. The quality of the dates is still good, and the price is 7.02 to 7.3 taels. There were also 290 packages of Chicken Heart red dates, which were of lesser quality and priced at 6.5 taels. Each merchant is expected to make this known. It was also reported that merchants from Guangbang had received over ten more cars. The market is said to be stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Taiyuan Crystal Sugar Opening Still Popular</h3>
<p>Coarse Sand White Sugar Market Even More Silent</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market production department received a telegram stating that the current price of Cuban sugar is still 2.00. New York futures sugar prices were: March 1.72 (down 1 point), May 1.74, September 1.81 (both down 2 points), and December 1.88 (down 3 points). The current price of Javanese sugar and the April futures price are both 10.375, and the May price is 10.625, each down 0.125 compared to the previous telegram. The public association market opened with Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white sugar. Trading was slow, and the market was chaotic. After an asking price of 7.225 taels, a few transactions were made, with the price still at 7.2 taels. No. 20 medium sand white sugar was 7.05 taels. Japanese sugar transactions were also scarce: YP mark 7.8 taels, N mark 7.825 to 7.85 taels. The market is generally stable. The Taiyuan crystal sugar market has been closed for a long time, and yesterday, over a hundred boxes opened at a price of 6.7 taels. They were all sold out and felt quite popular. At the same time, Wufu crystal sugar was also slightly sold at the same price. The market situation is said to be relatively stable.</p>

<h3>Chinese Ships Suspend Service to Northern Ports</h3>
<p>Foreign Ships' Business Improves</p>
<h3>Chinese Ships Stop Going to Tianjin</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese shipping company's resumption of service to northern ports lasted only ten days. The first outbound ship has not yet returned to Shanghai, and there is already news of suspension. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company originally scheduled the Tai Shun ship to go to Yantai and Tianjin today, but yesterday suddenly changed the route, ordering the Tai Shun ship not to go to Tianjin, but only to Yantai to load salt. All cargo and passengers bound for Tianjin were stopped from boarding yesterday. Furthermore, the Tu Nan ship, originally scheduled to depart tomorrow, was also ordered yesterday to cancel its northern voyages.</p>
<h3>Key Points for Promoting Shanghai Local Commemoration Day</h3>
<p>(1) Since our party launched the Northern Expedition from Guangdong in July of the 15th year of the Republic of China, the military strength has been sharp and swift, like a bamboo shoot, and successively occupied Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Jiangxi, and directly pointed to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shandong. The Communist Party harbored evil intentions, obstructed from the middle, and did everything to provoke discord. Fortunately, our General Commander Chiang Kai-shek was loyal and unwavering in his opposition to the Communist Party. He temporarily settled in Wuhan and personally led armed comrades to seize Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Shanghai is the most important city in the country, and its economic, situational, and public opinion influence is sufficient to affect the overall situation. Therefore, it is a battleground for revolutionary and counter-revolutionary forces. At that time, the Shanghai Communists, under the orders of their cadres, vigorously opposed the advance into Jiangsu and Zhejiang and squeezed out responsible comrades of our party in Shanghai everywhere. Furthermore, they secretly plotted to sabotage. Fortunately, the spirit of the Premier in heaven and the unity of the people allowed us to avoid being swayed by conspiracies. On March 20 of the 16th year of the Republic of China (i.e., 1927), the National Revolutionary Army arrived at Longhua, and the rebel army began to retreat. Our army completely occupied Shanghai. All secret work came to an end. We should know that when our party launched the Northern Expedition, the Communist Party initially opposed it. When opposition failed, they obstructed it. When obstruction failed, they ultimately destroyed it. Their conspiracy was aimed at overthrowing our party and only then would they be satisfied. Therefore, today, for the sake of consolidating our party and realizing the Three People's Principles, we must eliminate the Communist Party members and all quasi-communist remnants, such as the reorganization faction, so that we will not betray the past sacrifices of the Northern Expedition soldiers of our party, and the Three People's Principles will have a day to be realized.</p>
<p>(2) The recovery of Shanghai relied half on military victory and half on the struggle of the revolutionary masses. Looking back, the rebel army relied on the ports of Shanghai and stubbornly resisted. However, due to the efforts of our party comrades to destroy and repeatedly seek to respond from the rear, the rebel army suddenly faced worries and had no intention of fighting and was defeated. Therefore, the struggle of our revolutionary masses has made great contributions. Now that the Northern Expedition has been completed and the country is unified, all our people and comrades should remember the difficulty of the success of the National Revolution and the difficulty of recovering Shanghai, continue their fighting spirit, remain unwavering, support the central government, preserve this glorious and successful history, and complete the entire work of the National Revolution.</p>
<p>(3) The purpose of our party's Northern Expedition was not only to eliminate Cao Wu, but also to ensure that no one like Cao Wu would arise again after Cao Wu was eliminated. Since establishing the capital in Nanjing, we have strived forward with this purpose and completed the Northern Expedition in a year. The sacrifices of the party and the country and the hardships of our comrades are beyond description. All our compatriots and comrades should recuperate and work hard on construction. However, Gui, Feng, Zhang, and Tang successively rebelled. Fortunately, the spirit of the Premier and the efforts of our comrades succeeded in eliminating them. Only then can it be said that the revolutionary foundation is solid. Unexpectedly, the remnants of the Northern Warlords, Yan Xishan, took advantage of the central government's efforts to carry out construction, colluded with all the rebels, and brazenly issued the fallacy of "Lirang as the basis of the country." Furthermore, they secretly instigated their subordinates to raise troops and rebel, betraying the central government. They are truly the scourges of the party and the country. We, at this time, must support the central government and urge the authorities to resolutely issue an order to suppress and destroy these monsters to lay the foundation for the glory of the party and the country's recovery of Shanghai, which is an integral part of the entire revolution. If the skin does not exist, what will the fur adhere to? For the sake of safeguarding today's glory, we must only develop the spirit of eliminating the rebel army in those years and continue our efforts.</p>
<p>(4) The awareness that should be had in order to commemorate the glorious history of March 22 is as described above. Therefore, we still have work that must be done, that is, actively building a new Shanghai to complete the entire work of March 22. March 22 is only the work of destructively eliminating the remaining rebel army, and its purpose is to build a new Shanghai based on the party's doctrine, policies, and political programs. Therefore, we should, from now on, urge the municipal authorities to work hard to realize a new Shanghai in the shortest possible time, and only then can the work of March 22 be considered complete.</p>
<p>(5) Our awareness and efforts should be: 1. March 22 is the most glorious anniversary for the citizens of Shanghai. 2. To commemorate March 22, we must support the central government and consolidate the party and the country. 3. To commemorate March 22, we must accept the leadership of the party and eliminate the Communist bandits. 4. Continue the spirit of March 22 and overthrow Yan Xishan, the remnant of the Northern Warlords. 5. Continue the spirit of March 22 and overthrow all reactionary forces. 6. Work hard to build a new Shanghai and complete the work of March 22. 7. Long live the Chinese Kuomintang! 8. Long live the Republic of China!</p>

<h3>Xin Ming to Open to Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Shanghai was rife with rumors that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Ming ship had been seized by the Northern authorities. Northern passengers were quite worried, and many went to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to inquire. Yesterday afternoon, the company received a telegram from the Xin Ming ship, stating that it is currently at the Zizhulin Pier and plans to sail south tomorrow morning (i.e., the 20th), first to Yantai and then to Shanghai. The company has notified each passenger accordingly.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Shipping Cargo Extremely Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>Regarding the northern route, various shipping companies in Shanghai have agreed to increase freight rates on April 1st. Recently, various merchants have planned to take advantage of the price increase to rush the export of goods stored in Shanghai. Therefore, in recent days, the shipping of goods to the north has been extremely enthusiastic. Unexpectedly, the Chinese merchant ships have stopped running again. The export cargo of various merchants in Tianjin has to be reloaded onto British and Japanese foreign ships. The Taikoo Company has added a Yantai-Tianjin run, and five ships can be opened each week. The outbound cargo of the Tianjin Maru, Tangshan Maru, Hanyang Hao, Yusheng Hao, etc., on the northern foreign ships today and tomorrow are all full, and there are also many passengers.</p>

The flower baskets presented to the Crown Princess by Chairman Chiang and Foreign Minister Wang were custom-made by the Huamei Garden on Avenue Joffre. The flags of all nations and the uniforms for the Beijing errand boys were specially made by Xingshunxiang of Zhoujiazui.

<h3>British Postal Service Sticks Stamps on Each Letter</h3>
<p>Crackdown on Private Postal Agencies' Consolidated Packages</p>
<p>To be Implemented on April 1</p>
<p>Regarding the British-controlled Kuala Lumpur Postal Service's crackdown on private postal agencies' consolidated package method, it was previously reported that overseas Chinese representatives stated that this was initiated by the Chinese postal service. The Chinese postal service sent a telegram to inquire, and its reply was recorded in the previous report. It is now learned that the British-controlled Kuala Lumpur Postal Service has sent a letter to the Chinese postal service stating that after March 31st, all consolidated package letters from private postal agencies must be fully charged at the rate of the Universal Postal Union for each item. All overseas Chinese have been notified. The letter from the British-controlled Kuala Lumpur Postal Service and its notice are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter: The British-controlled Kuala Lumpur Postal Service letter dated March 5 (No. 1984.1929) states: "We received your postal service's telegram dated March 1st, stating: 'Regarding the consolidated package method of private postal agencies, our government has received a petition from the All-Overseas Chinese Congress, strongly opposing it, and claiming that the Governor of Singapore, the Superintendent of Chinese Affairs, and the postal authorities issued letters proving that this proposal was initiated by our government. Please reply with details of the situation at the time.'" After receiving the telegram, a reply was sent on the same day as follows: "We have received your telegram. Regarding the private postal agency case, when the Chinese representatives were received at the Singapore Governor's Office on January 20th, our office did not say that the proposal to abolish the special preferential treatment of consolidated packages from private postal agencies was initiated by the Chinese government." When the Chinese representatives were received, the Governor clearly notified the representatives that the government's decision on the case of cracking down on the consolidated package system of private postal agencies was to be implemented as soon as possible after the preparations were completed. The representatives reversed the facts and claimed that the Governor told them that this crackdown was initiated by your government, which is regrettable. The representatives reversed the facts in order to retain the preferential treatment of private postal agencies, which is deeply regrettable. It is now decided that after March 31st of this year, all postage must be fully charged at the rate of the Universal Postal Union for each item. The governments of the Nanyang Islands and the Malay Peninsula have issued two notices to inform the public. Two copies of the notices are enclosed for your reference."</p>
<p>Notice: (1) Government Gazette No. 10 of the Nanyang Islands Government, February 7, 1930, Postal Notice No. 236 of the Nanyang Islands Postal Service, for notice: Consolidated package letters from private postal agencies sent from the post offices of the Nanyang Islands to China for delivery shall be affixed with stamps for each item after March 31st of this year. The charge for the first ounce is 12 cents, and an additional 6 cents for each additional ounce or fraction thereof. Notice No. 844 published in the Gazette of April 30, 1924, shall be cancelled immediately. Please take note. (2) Government Gazette No. 1256 of the Federated Malay States Government, February 14, 1930, Postal Notice No. 25 of the Federated Malay States Postal Service, for notice: Consolidated package letters from private postal agencies sent from the Federated Malay States to China for delivery shall be affixed with stamps for each item after March 31st of this year. The charge for the first ounce is 12 cents, and an additional 6 cents for each additional ounce or fraction thereof. Please take note.</p>

<h3>French Concession Implements Sales Stamp Tax</h3>
<p>Huang Weisong and Others Hosted a Banquet for French Concession Authorities Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the matters of the French Concession's sales stamp tax, which were not finalized after negotiations between the former Bureau of Foreign Affairs and the French Concession authorities, after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered Chen Shiguang, Director of the Shanghai Office, to continue negotiations with the French Consul General and the French Concession authorities, it has now been completely resolved and implemented. Yesterday at 8:00 PM, Huang Weisong, Director of the French Concession Stamp Tax Bureau, Guan Tongzhi, Deputy Director, and Chen Shiguang, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office, hosted a banquet for the French Consul General and the French Concession authorities at the Diplomatic Discussion Society for this matter. Those present included French Consul General Cochrane, French Consul Ju Lan, French Consul Li, French Deputy Director Fu Teibaik (lawyer), Chairman Yu Qiaqing of the Chamber of Commerce, President Xu of the Provisional Court, Chinese Assessor Zhu of the French Municipality, Chinese Assessor Gong of the French Municipality, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Li Yingsheng, Liu Chunpu, Shen Rulin, Cheng Zhusun, Shang Mujang, Liu Yunfang, Wang Qinze, and Wu Shixing.

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Urges Shanghai Gas Company to Sign a Contract</h3>
<p>The British-owned Shanghai Gas Company has enjoyed the right to operate in the Chinese territory for many years but has not fulfilled its responsibilities. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, as the competent authority, has repeatedly negotiated with the company to sign a contract to determine its rights and obligations. Unexpectedly, the company has remained evasive, and the case has been suspended for more than a year. On January 29th of this year, the two sides once again continued negotiations and largely agreed on the contract terms. The bureau then drafted a Chinese contract based on the results of the talks and instructed the company to decide before February 15th. It then repeatedly urged the company by letter, but the company never gave a concrete reply. The bureau, considering its deliberate delay, had to resort to a decisive course of action. However, for the sake of prudence, it reported to the municipal government for consideration and sent a letter to the company yesterday solemnly declaring that three weeks from the date of the letter would be the final consideration period. The signing procedures must be completed within this period (i.e., before April 9th), otherwise, it will be considered that there is absolutely no sincerity, and decisive action will be taken, and all responsibilities will still be borne by the company.</p>

<h3>County Government Announces Abolition of Land Guards</h3>
<p>To Be Implemented on April 1</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued a notice yesterday, stating that it had previously received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, stating that it had received instructions from the Provincial Government, stating that the Department had submitted a memorial to the Provincial Government on whether the Land Guard system should be abolished, including a clear memorial on the opinions of each county, and that the original duties of the Land Guards should be managed by the Township Public Offices, and that this malpractice should be abolished quickly and resolutely by ordering its abolition, so as to avoid disturbing the people and hindering the instruction and training of government affairs.

<h3>Zhao Tieqiao's Suggestions Regarding the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>The Best Plan: Nationalize it.</p>
<p>The Middle Plan: National Management.</p>
<p>The Worst Plan: Joint Public-Private Management.</p>
<p>Zhao Tieqiao suggested to the Third Plenary Session: "In order to fundamentally resolve the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company issue, I earnestly request your consideration and adoption of the following suggestions for implementation. This will promote the spirit of the Party, revitalize national shipping, facilitate significant construction, and enrich the lives of the people. Our nation's shipping rights have been lost, industries have declined, and the people's livelihoods are withering. The construction of a shipping industry is truly a matter of utmost urgency. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen thoroughly reviewed global trends and deeply understood the major ailments within the country. With mature deliberation and meticulous planning, he included comprehensive elaborations of the path to shipping industry construction in the Three Principles of the People, the Nation-Building Program, the Industrial Plan, and other key documents for establishing the Party and the nation. He explicitly indicated the strategies, determined the methods, and repeatedly emphasized these points tirelessly. He provided us, his revolutionary comrades, with a perfect and precise blueprint. Therefore, for Party comrades today, in discussing shipping industry construction, our research and plans cannot surpass those of the late Premier. Besides following his teachings and the political program, there is no more convenient, better, or complete path. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the largest and oldest shipping organization in our country and the sole foundation for the Party and the nation to revitalize shipping and save the nation in the future. How it should be managed is undoubtedly a matter that must adhere to the late Premier's instructions as a prerequisite. Therefore, the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in June of last year to place it under the direct management of the National Government was indeed a diligent adherence to the late Premier's will. However, due to the unclearly defined boundaries between state and private enterprise, the situation has become increasingly entangled, leading to incessant disputes. Many proposals deviate from the Party's principles of consolidation, hindering progress. This has significant implications, potentially shaking the faith in our ideology and the implementation of our political program. I, Tieqiao, have been entrusted with government orders and have had the guidance and supervision to manage the company's affairs for over two years. I have upheld the mission of the Party and the nation, and I have examined the internal situation of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Based on two years of observation and experience, I believe that the most fundamental solution, the best strategy, is to follow the political program established by the late Premier and nationalize it. Only then can past disputes and difficulties be resolved, and future consolidation and development become attainable. The next best option, the alternative middle plan, is to emulate Japan's successful model of revitalizing its shipping industry by having the nation manage the Nippon Yusen Kaisha. Setting a period for national management can also prevent the corruption of shareholding cliques and their destructive influence, thereby achieving significant progress. If we abandon these top two strategies and choose a different path, it would lack a basis in both Party principles and precedents, leading us down a wrong road. Whether we choose to return it to private management or transform it into a joint public-private venture, our experiences in the past and our assessment of the current situation indicate that we would merely repeat past mistakes and fall into a dead end. This would undermine the Party and the nation's credibility and is undoubtedly a doomed, inferior strategy. The benefits and losses in this matter are as different as a hair's breadth and a thousand miles. As a Party member and fulfilling my duty, I dare not remain silent. I will now roughly explain the three strategies - the best, middle, and worst - for your consideration and deliberation. The Party and the nation's shipping industry depend on it.</p>
<p>(1) The Best Plan: Nationalization based on the Three Principles and the political program.</p>
<p>(A) Method: Based on the current situation of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, nationalization only requires the government's leadership and support by providing economic credit. It does not require raising a large amount of cash upfront, which would cause unnecessary doubts and hesitation.</p>
<p>(First) Methods for Compensating Share Capital can be divided into three types:</p>
<p>(A) Purchase entirely according to the current market price of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's shares. (Omission) The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company itself has the capacity to raise this amount without requiring the government to exert effort.</p>
<p>(B) Compensate according to the nominal value of all actual shares and newly issued shares (according to the new shipping shares and property shares issued by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company with remaining profits, totaling 4.4 million taels and 4.4 million yuan, which have not been formally approved by government authorities and have no legal basis). Shareholders would already benefit greatly from compensation at face value, but to show the Party's magnanimity, it can still be done. It can be guaranteed by using the customs tonnage dues collected from ship revenue as a guarantee fund, issuing shareholder bonds in installments with 3% interest, and expecting to clear it in fifteen years. Among this, the number of Sheng shares (i.e., 28,400 shipping shares and 14,200 property shares) should be further deducted. The actual amount only requires issuing public bonds of 8 million taels.</p>
<p>(C) To take an even more lenient step, compensate according to the calculated value of the property. Calculate the total property, after deducting debts, with a remaining amount of slightly over 20 million taels. It is proposed to issue public bonds with the aforementioned tonnage dues as a guarantee fund, extending the repayment period to twenty-five years. However, this method seems to be too disadvantageous for the government. According to the above three methods, whether repaying in cash or issuing public bonds, and with the public bonds having a guaranteed fund for interest, the bonds are reliable for purchase. This is vastly different from previously owning shares in name only, with no official dividends or interest. Shareholders will undoubtedly be willing to comply. The government only provides tonnage dues as a guarantee, and it only requires sixty to seventy million taels annually to be repaid in fifteen or twenty-five years. According to current gold standard tariffs, an additional 600,000 taels can be collected annually, which would not affect the national treasury in the slightest.</p>
<p>(Second) Raising Funds for Consolidation: The total funds required for consolidation are approximately 20 million yuan. Ten million yuan will be used to repay the large debt to HSBC, and ten million yuan will be taken from the total property for construction purposes such as shipbuilding and dock construction. The property withdrawn from HSBC will serve as collateral (valued at slightly over 30 million). Alternatively, the government can transfer the collateral to the Central Bank for mortgage or have it mortgaged by major domestic banks. With verified property, the banking syndicate will certainly accept it.</p>
<p>(Third) Organization of Personnel: Once nationalized, the organization of personnel should consider the execution, supervision, and oversight aspects. I believe that there should be one Director-General and seven Directors and seven Supervisors, all specially appointed by the National Government. The Directors should include representatives from the industrial and banking sectors, each responsible for design, innovation, and supervision. Three Standing Directors should be designated, and the Supervisors should be selected from among the Standing Directors, including representatives from the National Government's Auditing Department, Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Industrial Bank, and shipping industry. The term of office for all personnel should be three years.</p>
<p>As for the reasons for this nationalization, from the Party's standpoint, all of our comrades are well aware. Secondly, it relates to national defense, military transportation, culture, industry, foreign trade, and other matters, all of which should be nationalized. Furthermore, the establishment and development of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company relied entirely on official capital and resources. The corruption and transformation to private management by greedy officials are also well-known facts. It should be nationalized without any doubt.</p>
<p>(2) The Middle Plan: National Management.</p>
<p>The policy of national management was already resolved by the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, so there is no need to reiterate the reasons. However, there are four prerequisites that must be confirmed by the Plenary Session to resolve the company's disputes and prevent destructive conflicts.</p>
<p>(First) The term of national management should be specified as fifteen years, so that national policies can be implemented according to the schedule and the managing personnel can achieve success within a set time. This is based on Japan's successful national management model of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha and is highly worthy of reference.</p>
<p>(Second) National management also requires debt restructuring and fund raising to have a hopeful future. The method is the same as raising funds for national consolidation, except that there is no need to repay the share capital. A portion of the tonnage dues can be reallocated as a fund for issuing consolidation bonds, making it more flexible.</p>
<p>(Third) The government should provide a guaranteed interest rate, which only costs three to four hundred thousand annually. This demonstrates the Party and the nation's sincerity in revitalizing shipping, reinforces shareholders' faith, and increases the fluidity of funds and the speed of consolidation. If there is a surplus, official dividends and bonuses will be formally distributed, then there will be no need for guaranteed interest. The government may only be nominally responsible for it or may not spend anything at all.</p>
<p>(Fourth) For the organization of national management personnel, I believe that the original proposal of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee can be maintained, with both committees and specialists working together. However, one person each from the industrial, banking, and shipping sectors should be added to the committee, one to promote industry and economic development through mutual coordination and another to achieve the effect of uncovering hidden issues through mutual supervision.</p>
<p>(3) The Worst Plan: Joint Public-Private Management and Returning to Private Management.</p>
<p>Joint public-private management is illogical and will inevitably fail. Firstly, if the government engages in joint management, it would be equivalent to repealing the provisions of the Party's political program, thereby losing the faith of the national masses in the Party's ideology. Secondly, the government emphasizes national policies, while businesses emphasize profitability, and their goals are fundamentally different, making cooperation difficult. Thirdly, with government and business in the same boat, there will be power struggles and mutual constraints. We are already suffering under this system, so how can we repeat the same mistake? Fourthly, with the main entity of government and business not clearly defined, external doubts will increase, and it will be difficult to establish credibility. With such conflicting phenomena everywhere, how can there be any possibility of mutual assistance? (Omission)</p>

<h3>Crew Members of the Flying Tiger Ship Describe the Circumstances of the Collision and Sinking</h3>
<p>The accident of the Sanbei Flying Tiger Wheel has been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday, the crew members of the ship returned to Shanghai on the bureau's Chang'an Wheel, including the chief mate, Yan Zurui, and 44 others. When they met with reporters yesterday, they gave a very detailed account of the truth about the Flying Tiger accident. The following is a brief record:</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Collision: The Flying Tiger Wheel, the Yongxing Jiangxin, and the Jiangzhen warship were all docked at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company wharf in Hankou. At noon on the 24th of last month, the Flying Tiger was ordered to move to the commercial port. During the turning of the ship, its stern compartment collided violently with the bow of the Jiangzhen warship. A large hole was immediately punched in the stern of the Flying Tiger, and the river water rushed in, making it impossible to save. Therefore, the ship sank in only twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Boatmen Seize Property: There were small sampans in the river. When the Flying Tiger had an accident, forty or fifty small sampans, under the pretext of rescue, swarmed onto the ship. They used axes to chop open the doors of the cabins where the crew members and sailors lived, and then entered to rob. They looted all public and private items, crew members' luggage, money, etc., seeing everything they could grab. Several sailors stepped forward to try to take it back, but when they refused to let them enter the room, the sampan men used axes to chop at them. Two sailors were injured on the spot. There were no water police present at the time, so they had to be robbed clean. The crew members' personal belongings alone suffered losses of nearly 10,000 yuan. Everyone barely escaped with their lives.</p>
<p>Ship Damage: The Flying Tiger Wheel sank completely at 12 o'clock that night, leaving only the chimney. The total loss reached more than 200,000 yuan. The company is currently planning to salvage it, but it is said that the salvage fee is extremely high, so work has not yet begun.</p>
<p>Negotiations in Progress: After the Flying Tiger accident, Sanbei Company reported it to the insurance company. It is now heard that the insurance company said that this ship was sunk by a warship, which does not comply with ordinary insurance regulations, and there is news that it will not be compensated. The company has now submitted a report to the headquarters, detailing that the collision was the fault of the warship and requesting the Navy Department to recognize and compensate for the loss.</p>
<h3>Shipping News</h3>
<p>New Taikoo Ship Coming: To expand its coastal shipping business in China, British Taikoo Company specially built the Taiyuan and Jinan wheels. The Taiyuan wheel has been completed first and has been assigned to run on the Shanghai-Guangdong line. The Jinan new wheel, which was built in the company's Hong Kong factory, has also been completed. With a load of more than 3,000 tons, it is scheduled to open its maiden voyage to Shanghai on the 23rd of this month, and it will also be ordered to run the Nanyang class. After the completion of these two ships, the company has a total of 71 large and small sea-going ships, totaling 165,000 net tons.</p>
<p>Chichibu and Ryuta Start Classes: The second ship Shichibu Maru and the third ship Ryuda Maru of the three Pacific Ocean giants built by the Japanese Post Office have been completed and the passenger seats have also been installed. The style is the same as that of Asami Maru. Chichibu is scheduled to start the first class on April 1st, and Asami is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on April 18th.</p>
<h3>Record of the Annual Meeting of the Waiming Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Criticism of Current Affairs in Our Country</p>
<p>Electing the President and Directors</p>
<p>The Waiming Chamber of Commerce, composed of foreign firms in this port, held its annual meeting the other day. President Laiman was unable to attend due to illness, and Vice President Mr. McMeekan presided over the meeting. He reported on the chamber's work over the past year, briefly stating that the radio signal station established by the Chinese government on North Saddle Island has been established for several months and has benefited shipping greatly. If the experiment is effective, it is also planned to add another one somewhere in the future so that ships passing the Amherst Reef will not encounter danger even in fog. He then said that the ambassadors of various countries to China recently negotiated with the Chinese authorities on the agreement on the Shanghai Provisional Court without consulting the Public Works Bureau and foreign firms in Shanghai. This kind of arbitrary action is very disappointing. He then said that the sharp drop in silver prices has greatly harmed foreign firms engaged in the import trade, especially the weaving industry. Recently, the Chamber of Commerce has discussed setting up a piece goods association to stipulate the standard for trading in Shanghai's general yuan currency as one of its main purposes, which has been approved by chambers of commerce in various countries. After passing the account briefly, Mr. McMeekan and Mr. Saito were elected as the president and vice president of this year, and 12 new directors including Poolson were elected and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Leng Juan Returned to Shanghai from the Province Yesterday</h3>
<p>The County Public Security Fund Ended Satisfactorily</p>
<p>Shanghai County Magistrate Leng went to the province by car on the 12th of this month to discuss and determine the method with the Department of Civil Affairs due to the difficulty of the county's public security funding. He has now completed his official business and returned to Shanghai yesterday to take office. According to Leng, the result of this trip to the province was quite satisfactory. The provincial government has agreed to instruct the Department of Finance to provide subsidies before the Shanghai County Public Security Fund is prepared, in order to maintain local public security. The officials and police of the County Public Security Bureau all showed joy at this news.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute in the Pharmaceutical Industry Yesterday</h3>
<p>The pharmaceutical workers' strike has lasted for a week. Yesterday, the trade association convened a general meeting of members and issued a declaration. The workers' union also held a meeting in the afternoon, the content of which is unknown. The Social Affairs Bureau is convening the third mediation period, which will be held in the next two days, so the resumption of work will have to wait until after the mediation at the earliest. The Commercial Press Workers' Union issued a declaration yesterday to support the pharmaceutical workers. The Chinese Medicine Association has also received approval from the municipal government.</p>
<h3>Jade Import Tax Rate Reduced</h3>
<p>The Municipal Commercial Consolidation Association received an approval order from the Ministry of Finance yesterday regarding the reduction of import taxes on jade, and specially sent a letter to notify the two jade industry groups. The original letter said, "We are writing to inform you that we have received a letter stating that the increase in import taxes on rough jade has affected business, please review and reduce the amount. We have presented the matter to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has issued an order stating that the case has been reviewed and noted. On March 17, we received the Ministry of Finance's Order Guan Zi No. 993, stating, "We have learned of the matter. We have investigated the request to reduce the import tax rate on rough jade. According to the Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce, the raw materials of jade are made into utensils in Guangdong Province and are still sold overseas. Not only are there more impurities and waste when they are made, but before they are dissected, their true value is difficult to determine, which is not the same as agate and gemstones that have not been polished and retain their valuable properties. Therefore, this item of rough jade should be classified in the current tax rules. Item No. 718, not listed, is taxed at 35% of the value to maintain craftsmanship." In addition to the instructions, we have also ordered the Customs Service to order the General Customs Office to order all customs offices to comply. We are sending this letter to you accordingly and hope that you will check and comply. This is addressed to Shen Pu Jade Bang Kun He Tang Guang Yun Jade Bang Kun Yu Tang."</p>

<h3>County Organization Department Changes the Names of Party Headquarters in Various Districts</h3>
<p>The names and numbers of the party headquarters in each district of Shanghai County are different from the names and numbers of the administrative districts, resulting in many misunderstandings. The previous Executive Committee had a proposal to change the names of the district party headquarters, which was approved by the Provincial Organization Department. However, it was not implemented because it was ordered to stop activities. After that, the Provincial Consolidation Committee sent Jiang Wenbao and five others as consolidation members of Shanghai County, and telegraphed to appoint member Wu Jingqing as the Minister of Organization. After receiving the order, Minister Wu immediately began to change the names of the party headquarters in various districts in the takeover volumes and announced them in accordance with the current administrative regions, as follows:</p>
<p>Party Member Name Administrative Region Address</p>
<p>First District Party Headquarters First District Office Xing</p>
<p>Second District Party Headquarters Second District Office Caotang</p>
<p>Third District Party Headquarters Third District Office Zhuanbei</p>
<p>Fourth District Party Headquarters Fourth District Office Sanlin Chenhang</p>
<p>Fifth District Party Headquarters Sixth District Office Maqiao</p>

<h3>Zhou Zenyi Escapes Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Athlete Uses Fists to Repel Bandits</p>
<p>Hawker Suffers Innocent Disaster, Zhou Also Injured in Thigh</p>
<p>Police Arrive in Response to Alarm</p>
<p>Bandits Flee Empty-Handed</p>
<p>Zhou Fujiou, a wealthy merchant from the old Jiangxi, started his career in the salt industry and is well-known in Shanghai. His three sons, Zitain, inherited the legacy of their ancestors and associated with many wealthy merchants. In the past, he built his own residence at No. 1 Xiaoshadu Road and had a good reputation in the business community. However, in recent years, he moved to No. 672 Jing'an Lane, Jing'an Temple Road. Zitain had four sons, and Zenyi is the eldest. At the age of 19, he studied at the Shanghai Municipal Council's Gezhi Public School on Beihai Road. He is tall and sturdy, has the appearance of a martial artist, and is fond of sports and ball games. He is proficient in kicking and striking, so he is praised by his classmates in the school. Yesterday afternoon, he suddenly encountered bandits outside the school gate who intended to kidnap him. Fortunately, he relied on his agile skills to avoid a major disaster. There were three bandits in total. They first rented a car No. 17532 from Jiujiang Automobile Company on Jiujiang Road and waited outside the school for two hours. At about 5:10 pm, Zhou Zenyi went out with three or four classmates. Before they had walked ten steps, the bandits greeted them and demanded that they get in the car. Zhou took advantage of the bandits' unpreparedness to repel the enemy with his fists. In the rush, a gunshot was fired, injuring a hawker. He immediately ran back to school. The bandits were unwilling to give up and fired another shot, hitting his left thigh. He entered the gate injured and told the principal. The bandits also took the opportunity to drive away. Zhou was fortunate to avoid this disaster when the bandits were already close.</p>
<p>Using Fists to Repel Bandits: Zhou Zenyi went out of the school gate with two friends at about 5:10 pm, which was long after the class was over. He had finished playing ball games with his friends. The bandits had been waiting on the road for a long time. When they saw Zhou coming, two bandits greeted him on the road. When they were close to him, they showed him their guns and ordered him not to move. Zhou's friends had already walked several steps ahead, so he was isolated and unable to call for help. One bandit held him in his hand, gradually rising from below, intending to point at Zhou's chest and force him into the car. However, Zhou suddenly came up with a clever idea in his extreme fear, signaling to the two bandits that he would obey, and in an instant, he suddenly waved his arm and punched the bandit's arm straight. The bandit retreated in pain and still held his gun firmly, staggering backwards.</p>
<p>Hawker Injured by Bullet: Although the bandit retreated, he still held the pistol in his hand. He immediately pulled the trigger and fired in the direction of where Zhou was standing. Zhou Zenyi, before he could catch his breath, saw the muzzle of the gun pointing at him and knew that things were not good, so he bowed his body to dodge. The bullet went off to the side and hit the right arm of Zhu Xicai, a hawker diagonally opposite the school gate. Zhou immediately turned around and ran wildly towards the school gate in the smoke. Fortunately, the place was not far away, and he arrived in an instant. The injured hawker was later sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by the police.</p>
<p>Shot in the Thigh: Zhou Zenyi ran back to school with great speed, waving his arms and moving his thighs, which was the result of practicing racing in sports. However, the bandits saw the fat meat that seemed to be in their mouths, but lost it again, and were immediately disgusted. They fired a shot at him. A bullet flew and hit Zhou's left thigh. When he entered the gate with his injuries, the police had already gathered in response to the alarm and were chasing the bandits with whistles. The bandits took advantage of the commotion to drive back in the original car. Zhou Zenyi told Deputy Director Zeng Xiaojun what he had encountered and was immediately sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injury was not critical. After applying the medicine, he immediately went out and was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment by his family in a car.</p>
<p>Bandits Rent a Car: Afterwards, someone reported to the Laoza Police Station that the license plate number of the bandits' car was White Plate 17532. This car belonged to Jiujiang Automobile Company on Jiujiang Road. At about 2:40 pm yesterday, a young customer with a mustache came to rent it. The driver was Chen Luosheng. The car was a Panqi sedan. The license plate number was Concession 17532 and Chinese Area 4218. The car went out of the gate and first went to the New World Company to wait briefly, picked up two customers, and then drove to Beihai Road to wait. After the incident, the driver Chen Luosheng saw that the situation was not good and jumped out. The bandits drove away. Later in the evening, the car was found near Xiaoshadu in western Shanghai and was not damaged.</p>
<h3>A Thief Shot Dead in Front of Boyong Hospital Last Night</h3>
<p>Robbery at a Yunnan Road Native Goods Store</p>
<p>A Robbery also Occurred on Avenue Edward VII</p>
<p>The Two Cases Happened About Ten Minutes Apart</p>
<p>Shanghai Teeming with Bandits</p>
<p>Last night at 8:40 PM, four bandits, dressed in blue cloth shirts and trousers and speaking with local accents, suddenly entered the Sheng Dingchang Native Goods Store, No. 601-602 Yunnan Road, owned by Sheng Huaiyu from Suzhou. Two bandits, one with a gun, stood guard at the door, while another stood in front of the counter to watch. The two bandits who were empty-handed jumped into the store and robbed about four hundred and forty-odd yuan in cash from the counter. They then carried the stolen goods and fled towards the second alley of Yudeli across the street and north, disappearing without a trace. The owner immediately reported the loss to the police station, requesting an investigation. However, before even ten minutes had passed, another robbery occurred at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Tibet Road. One thief was immediately pursued and caught by patrol officers and shot dead in front of Boyong Hospital. This led to the mistaken belief that it was the same incident as the store robbery. Upon further investigation, it was found that they were two separate cases.</p>
<p>Diamond Ring Robbed: Last night around 8:30 PM, a certain Mr. A, of advanced age and dressed in fine clothes, was wearing a diamond ring on his hand. He was suddenly stopped by three or more thugs on the western section of Avenue Edward VII. The diamond ring was robbed, and twenty-seven yuan in silver in his pocket was also taken. The robbers then fled. Afterwards, the victim followed the robbers, tailing them to the Yunnan Road intersection opposite the Great World. He reported to the police post, saying that the person in the black shirt ahead was not a good person. The police, upon receiving the information, immediately drew their guns and gave chase.</p>
<p>Ten Shots Fired: A detective from the Old North Gate Police Station also joined the pursuit. The robbers, seeing the police, resisted with their guns. The police opened fire, firing about ten shots in total. The robbers were no match and were hit four times, falling to the ground and dying. The deceased was about twenty-four or twenty-five years old, wearing a black Chinese silk gown. The original stolen diamond ring was found in his pocket, but the silver coins were gone.</p>
<h3>All Perpetrators in the Stepmother Slaying Case Requested to be Sentenced to Death by the Police</h3>
<p>Chen Hengcai is of Short Stature</p>
<p>The Lawyer Asked How Could He Commit Murder</p>
<p>Closing Arguments Were Declared Yesterday</p>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the 28th</p>
<p>The case of Zhang Wenqing from Huzhou, along with her lover Chen Hengcai, conspiring with Yao Yonggui and Gao Jintang to kill the stepmother Zhang Su, continued in the Second Provisional Court yesterday morning for closing arguments. The audience of men and women was as crowded as in previous sessions, indicating the public's great interest in this case. First, the lawyer for the victim's family presented the settlement agreement from the previous lawsuit between Zhang Wenqing's legal mother, Zhang Su, and the concubine Zhang Su regarding the management of the late husband Zhang Fusheng's property. Judge Ren Ji reviewed the document and then handed it to Zhang Wenqing to read. According to Zhang Wenqing, the written amount of seven thousand taels of silver was actually a mistake for eight thousand four hundred taels, and she was not present when the document was written. Next, lawyer Fan Gang defended Chen Hengcai, arguing that Chen was accused of conspiring with the other defendants. He asked the court to consider Chen's short stature and lack of knowledge, asking how could he conspire to commit murder. Furthermore, the testimonies of the defendants were full of contradictions. Yao Yonggui testified that Chen invited him to fight and intimidate the deceased, but Yao and Gao acted impulsively and killed the person. Chen was acting on his master's orders and should not be considered a co-conspirator. He should be treated leniently. Next, Gao Jintang's lawyer defended Gao, saying that Gao did not know the Zhang family and had no animosity towards them. He was merely being used as a tool. The police's charge of Article 284 against Gao was too severe and should be treated leniently. Zhang Wenqing's lawyer, Wang Fushang, also offered supplementary arguments, stating that Zhang's confession at the police station may have been coerced and should not be adopted. Furthermore, the murder weapon could not be proven to have been given by Zhang. Although the Zhang family had lost a knife, it was questionable whether the knife wounds on the deceased were inflicted by that knife. The missing knife from the Zhang family had not been found. Finally, the police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, rebutted each point made by Wang, saying that this case was unprecedented. The four defendants had premeditated and committed the crime together and should be sentenced to death to serve as a warning to others. At this point, the arguments from all sides concluded. Judge Luo announced that sentencing would be on the morning of March 28th, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Trial Opens for Sun Xunqu's Married Daughter's Property Dispute</h3>
<p>Sun's Inheritance Already Divided Twice</p>
<p>Sun Zhongyao Emits a Sigh in Court</p>
<p>The Distribution of Property in the Fourteenth Year Was Not Formal</p>
<p>Plaintiff Jinghua Was Absent from Court Yesterday</p>
<p>After the death of Sun Xunqu, a wealthy businessman from Wuxi, his estate of over 500,000 yuan was divided into six shares by his sons Sun Zhongwei, Zhongyao, Zhongying, Zhongchu, Zhonghu, and Zhongju several years ago. Sun also had two daughters, the eldest named Jinghua, who married Hu Disheng. Recently, Jinghua cited the 181st resolution of the Central Executive Committee and the declaration of the Second National Congress, stating that women, whether married or unmarried, have the right to inherit property. She hired lawyer Song Mingxun and filed a lawsuit against Zhongwei et al. in the Provisional Court, requesting that the estate be divided into eight shares so that her sister could also receive a share. A summary of her complaint has already been published in the newspapers. The case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Feng Shide in the Tenth Court. The plaintiff, Hu Sun Jinghua, was absent and represented by lawyer Song. According to the lawyer, the defendants stated that the property was divided in 1925, but this was not accurate. The defendants divided the estate in March 1928. The agreement stated that all real estate was distributed according to the will. The will conflicts with current laws and is therefore invalid. Furthermore, it is questionable whether this will is genuine. Therefore, he requested that the property be divided according to the law. The defendants Zhongwei, Zhongyao, and Zhongying, accompanied by their lawyers, Wang Fushang et al., appeared in court. The others were absent and had no legal representation. Sun Zhongwei testified that he was 48 years old. His father's estate was indeed divided in 1925, and there was a will as proof. In February 1928, the estate was re-divided because the younger brothers were young, and their shares were managed by the elders. The shares of myself, Zhongyao, and Zhongying were kept in the Shanghai Industrial Bank's vault and could only be withdrawn with the joint signatures of the depositors. If the court wanted to inspect the deeds of the property, they could be produced next time. Lawyer Wang Fushang stated that the defendants divided the property once in 1925 and again in 1928. The plaintiff requested a re-division, but it was unclear which distribution she was referring to. Lawyer Song replied that since the division agreement mentioned distribution according to the will, Xunqu must have already passed away at the time of the distribution. Therefore, the plaintiff was referring to the 1928 distribution. The agreement also stated that the family division was strictly according to the will and equally divided, meaning each person received one share. Defendant Sun Zhongyao, a 29-year-old accountant, testified that the plaintiff was his older sister and that the estate was actually divided in 1925. The lawyer for defendant Zhongying stated that Zhongying had been adopted into the eldest branch, Wangjiao Gong, and the inheritance he received was from Wangjiao Gong, not from Xunqu. Therefore, Zhongying should not be listed as a defendant in this case. Zhongying testified that Wangjiao Gong had a large estate, which Xunqu managed on his behalf after Wangjiao died early. After Xunqu passed away, Wangjiao's branch was inherited by me, but his estate was not entirely mine. What I received was one-sixth of the combined property of Wang and Xunqu, which was far from what I should have received. I did not value the estate and did not object at the time. Now, I am being sued. If I had known there would be a lawsuit, I would have insisted on taking sole possession of Wangjiao's estate so that I would not be involved today. His words expressed a sense of regret. Witness Hu Disheng testified that the distribution did occur in 1928, and he was present at the time. The distribution in 1925 was not formal. Judge Feng ordered both parties to withdraw and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>The Thieves Had Leisurely Interests</h3>
<p>The Robbers of the Four Banks' Reserve</p>
<p>Watched a Soccer Match at the Baseball Field</p>
<p>Six Men and Women Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>2,000 Yuan in Stolen Goods Recovered from the Thieves' Den</p>
<p>The reserve of the four banks, namely, China &amp; South Sea Bank, Yieh Commercial Bank, The Continental Bank, and Jincheng Bank, sent an old clerk to deliver banknotes and coins worth 46,000 yuan accompanied by armed police escorts, at 2:00 pm on the 13th of this month, to the banks on the Bund, such as, The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China and The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, when passing Guangdong Road, they were robbed by bandits wielding weapons. First the armed police were disarmed, then the bank notes and coins were robbed and they escaped in a car. The next day, the car was found in the city. The car owner was ordered to take it back and the police were ordered to arrest the fleeing robbers. It was already in the previous newspapers. It wasn't until the day before yesterday that Liang Chengyu, a private detective of the Old North Gate Police Station, received a report that the robbers in this case were hiding at the baseball field on Observatory Road in the French Concession. Detective Liang, along with detectives Feng Zhiming and Heden, and detectives from the French Concession Police Station, rushed to the baseball field at 3:00 pm. At that time, Jinan and Huale were holding a soccer championship match. Six robbers, Yuan Genfa, Yu Ziyi, Qian Amao, Xia Zhanchun, from Suzhou and women Li Wang and Zhou MeiMei, were arrested from the audience and taken back to the police station. After investigation, it was learned that accomplices were living at No. 54 Mintini Road. When they went to arrest them again, but they had already fled after hearing the news. Only the original stolen goods of 2,000 yuan in banknotes and silver were seized in the robbers' den. Yesterday morning, the six men and women, including Yuan, were taken to the First Provisional Court, where Judge Gao Junxiang interrogated them.

Yesterday morning, Zhang went out for business, and his wife went out to buy vegetables, leaving only Xiaomei alone to guard the house. Ma Afu, 24 years old, from Tongzhou, who used to pull rickshaws and lives at No. 30 of the alley, (his wife, Wang, is working outside,) broke into the house and, seeing that there was no one in the room, began to play with her. Xiaomei was very innocent, and since Ma was also acquainted with her, she stayed by Ma's side and did not leave. Who knew that Ma would suddenly become animalistic and have lustful thoughts. He pushed Xiaomei to the ground, took off her pants, and raped her. Xiaomei was young and weak and could not resist, allowing him to ravage her, causing serious injuries to her lower body, with blood flowing all over the ground, and the pain was unbearable. Ma, seeing that his wish had been fulfilled, was about to escape, but Chen happened to return and, seeing this situation, was filled with uncontrollable anger. She called her husband together and led her daughter to twist Ma to the Fifth District Headquarters. The director believed that Ma's rape of a young girl was extremely illegal, and he observed that the girl's wounds were quite severe and she could not walk, so he sentenced her to the judicial department for strict investigation.</p>

<p>Transferred to the Local Court</p>
<p>Mrs. Wei Zhang, wife of Wei Jia-nian, residing at No. 4, Fu'an Lane, Caiyang Wharf, Nanshi, aged thirty-eight, suddenly quarreled yesterday because her thirteen-year-old son was beaten by Ji Tianrong, a leather craftsman living nearby. During the argument, Ji allegedly claimed to have had a previous intimate relationship with Mrs. Wei, implying that she shouldn't make such a fuss. Mr. Wei, upon hearing this, and confident in his wife's propriety and chastity, accused Ji of groundlessly defaming her reputation. He took Ji into custody and brought him to the First Precinct, First Division, requesting an investigation. When questioned, Ji confessed that he had indeed been having a private affair with Mrs. Wei for many years. The police station summoned Mrs. Wei for questioning, but she denied the allegations.

<h3>Lake Chow Chamber of Commerce Plans Reorganization</h3>
<p>Wang Yiting Has Not Yet Convened a Meeting</p>
<p>The Lake Chow Chamber of Commerce has not held a meeting for six years. The previous directors have long been out of date. The Social Affairs Bureau appointed Wang Yiting and seven others as reorganization committee members, designating Wang as chairman to convene meetings. It is reported that all committee members have received official letters of appointment from the Social Affairs Bureau. Chen Aishi, Yang Kuihou, Zhu Bangsheng, and Shen Tianxin, four committee members, jointly sent a letter to Chairman Wang, requesting that he convene a meeting as soon as possible to comply with the order. Wang Yiting replied, stating that he had received the official letter and understood. The charter of the Lake Chow Chamber of Commerce does not comply with current regulations, and the qualifications of the directors are outdated. Former directors stated that the chamber has been occupied by troops for a long time, making it impossible to hold meetings, elect new members, or revise the charter. A previous notice was issued to convene at the Cocoon Industry Association, but the Social Affairs Bureau stopped the meeting that day, and it was not successful. The former directors may not agree to the reorganization. It is proposed that the Social Affairs Bureau draft the charter, which Director Pan has agreed to do. It is expected to be issued within a few days. Once the charter is received, the chamber can hold a meeting. The temporary reorganization can be delayed to avoid misunderstandings among the townspeople. However, it is reported that the Social Affairs Bureau will strictly order the former directors of the chamber, who were elected six years ago, to hand over control to the reorganization committee to facilitate the reorganization, and will not allow them to delay any further.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Visits Promotes Bamboo Carving</h3>
<p>Personnel Sent to Fenghua First, Then to Jiading for Investigation</p>
<p>The Bureau of Visits of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce believes that the bamboo carvings of Jiading are excellent in production and have a long-standing reputation. They are highly artistic. Not only do Chinese people like to buy and use them, but foreigners also treasure them. Therefore, these utensils are exported overseas every year. However, this industry has recently been declining, resulting in sluggish sales. Although Fenghua, Zhejiang, also produces bamboo carvings, the production is slightly inferior, and sales are also not strong. In order to promote the industry, the Bureau of Visits has sent staff member Yang Zhuojun to Fenghua first to investigate. After completion, he will go to Jiading for investigation in order to design promotion plans. It is reported that Mr. Yang, after receiving the order, has scheduled to take a boat to Ningbo and then to Fenghua tomorrow (the 21st) to conduct an investigation with the local Construction Bureau on the latest situation of the industry.</p>
<h3>Record of the Public Banquet of Representatives of Public Organizations in Wusong</h3>
<p>Requesting Various Agencies to Protect Merchant Ships</p>
<p>Zheng Shushan, Chairman of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, Lu Damin, representative of shipping merchants from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and others held a public banquet yesterday afternoon at the Ningbo Merchant Fire Brigade building on Wusong Outer Ma Road, honoring Tax Commissioner Yang and representatives from various agencies. They also presented them with plaques and silver articles in recognition of their virtuous governance. Among those present were Deng Zhenquan, Commander of the Wusong Fortress, Wu Zhennan, Director of the National River Patrol, Jiang Bin, Naval Commander, Zhu Bingzheng, Chief of the Fourth District of Water Police, Chen Youhua, Chief of the Seventh District of Water Police, Chief Zhang of the Seventh District, First Division, Team Leader Wu of the Salt Smuggling Bureau, Wu Jia, Magistrate of Baoshan County, Shen Jing, Police Chief of the Public Security Bureau, Shen Fusheng, Director of the Shipping Bureau, and Tang Zuanzhi, Commander of the Security Corps. First, Zheng Shushan, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, delivered a eulogy, followed by a response from Tax Commissioner Yang. Then, a joint meeting was held, during which Chairman Zheng proposed that the fishing season is approaching, and there will be more ships traveling to and fro. However, piracy is rampant, making shipowners fearful. If strict defense is not implemented, there will be three negative consequences: (1) National tax revenue cannot be fully collected; (2) The livelihood of shipowners depends entirely on the income from the fishing season; (3) The prosperity or decline of Wusong's commerce depends on the number of ships arriving at Wusong. Therefore, it is requested that the Coastal Patrol, the Naval Command, and the Fourth District of Water Police jointly dispatch warships for strict patrols to ensure public safety and increase revenue. In case of emergencies, it is requested that the fortress command pay special attention to the various sailing ships and be especially accommodating, as sailing ships must travel with the wind and tide. If they are prevented from entering the port during evening high tide due to martial law, and are subsequently attacked by bandits, it would be a death sentence. It is hoped that the military and police authorities will show understanding and provide protection. After deliberation, the authorities agreed to take responsibility and order their subordinates to comply. Chairman Zheng further stated that ships entering the Yangtze River have traditionally paid taxes according to regulations at the Fishing Boat Bureau, and the Customs had no tax collection relationship. Now, detailed inspections are being imposed, which inevitably delays time and causes losses. Therefore, he requested Tax Commissioner Yang to show understanding and order that the previous procedures be followed without causing difficulties. With just a few words, the shipowners received real benefits and invisible convenience, which is truly significant. Furthermore, the transportation of coal and charcoal is done by small cargo ships from the Yangtze River to supply the residents of the town. Although violations of the cargo handling procedures should be punished according to regulations, he hopes that Tax Commissioner Yang will consider their initial ignorance and grant leniency. People are not plants or trees, how can they not be grateful? In the past, the Customs sovereignty belonged to foreign management, and customs officials often extorted, delayed, levied arbitrary fines, and accepted bribes to release ships. Such abuses were ignored. Tax Commissioner Yang is well aware of these malpractices and seeks to eliminate them completely, so that state revenue will increase, and the people's hardships will be alleviated. The benefits received by the merchant ships are beyond description. The banquet and presentation of the plaques are not meant as repayment, but merely to express our gratitude and serve as a lasting memorial. After the discussions, the banquet began and everyone enjoyed themselves before dispersing.</p>
<h3>Record of the Meeting of the Chinese and Foreign Charity Association</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Charity Association held a board meeting at 5:00 PM on the 18th. The Chinese and foreign general secretaries reported on the charity work carried out, stating that since last year, grain funds had been released to Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces, totaling 381,923.88 silver dollars. This year, another 74,500 silver dollars have been allocated to Henan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces for disaster relief. It was reported that Shaanxi has poor transportation, a complete lack of food, and the disaster victims' livelihoods have been cut off. Over two million people have died of starvation, and over 500,000 have fled the famine. It was decided to quickly allocate another 16,000 silver dollars. Next, Gansu, including Gaolan, Yuzhong, Dingxi, Tongwei, and Hongshui counties, has not received rain or snow since last autumn. Taohe, Lintao, Hezheng, Ningding, Yongjing, Wushan, Longxi, Taomin and other counties have been plagued by bandits, resulting in widespread displacement. There is no seed grain. It was decided to allocate another 10,000 silver dollars to provide assistance. Additionally, the previous 5,000 silver dollars for disaster relief in Yancheng, Jiangsu, and 4,000 silver dollars each for Xinghua, Funing, and Baoying were insufficient. The situation is dire, with starvation widespread and people waiting for death. Baoying is particularly severe, with the eastern townships being the hardest hit. Over 1,600 villages need urgent relief, and another 1,000 villages are in serious condition. Disaster victims are eating wild grass and wheat bran to survive, and many are unable to walk and are on the verge of death. If they are not rescued quickly, they will all starve to death. However, the disaster area is too wide and funding is difficult. It was decided to raise 10,000 silver dollars and allocate an additional 2,000 silver dollars each to Yancheng, Funing, and Xinghua, actually needing 4,000 silver dollars each, to alleviate the spring famine. It was also reported that western Henan has suffered repeated disasters, and northern Anhui has suffered repeated droughts, affecting as many as 21 counties. In addition, northern Jiangsu has suffered from consecutive years of famine, with no harvests. The people are in imminent danger of starvation. It was decided that unless donations are solicited from all sectors of society, it will be impossible to save these remaining people.</p>
<h3>Anti-Opium Society Announces Statistics on Opium and Morphine Offenders in Jilin Province</h3>
<p>Over 12,000 People Detained and Imprisoned in Three Years</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society has been collecting various anti-opium achievements for years, and the materials are very comprehensive. Reports have been received successively from Jianghai Customs, national courts, and provincial and county governments. Apart from Jianghai Customs, which has submitted complete lists, national courts have submitted 70% and county governments 20%. All materials have been sorted and will be statistically released by the society's statistics department as a reference for future anti-opium measures. Among the reports, the most detailed are from the civil affairs departments of Zhejiang and Shanxi provinces, which have seriously handled this matter and obtained complete reports. The reports from Jilin province are also relatively concrete, as the provincial government and the High Court pay close attention to opium prohibition. Therefore, the reports from the counties under the province are also more detailed. The total number of opium and morphine offenders detained and imprisoned by courts and county governments, prisons, and detention centers in Jilin province in the three years of the Republic of China's 15th, 16th, and 17th years has been reported by the relevant authorities and compiled by the High Court and Civil Affairs Department, and has been analyzed and statistically completed by the Anti-Opium Society's statistics department. The total number of opium and morphine offenders detained and imprisoned in three prisons, eight courts, and twenty-five county prisons or detention centers in the three years of the Republic of China's 15th, 16th, and 17th years is 12,303, of which 10,407 are opium offenders, accounting for 84.6% of the total, and 1,896 are morphine offenders, accounting for 25.4% of the total. The breakdown is as follows:</p>

<h3>National Goods Factory Association Concerned About Donations in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association telegraphed Qian, Director of the Zhejiang Finance Department, stating that the purpose of machine-made imitations of foreign goods is to benefit the people and prevent leakage of wealth. In order to encourage industry and recover rights and interests, the government has issued orders to exempt them from donations to encourage them. The Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Jinhua, Quzhou and Yan Prefectures, foreign cloth, woolen and down donation headquarters collect taxes and levies on machine-made imitations of woven products equal to those on foreign goods, and cause many difficulties. This prevents these woven goods from being sold extensively in Zhejiang Province, which is contrary to the government's intention to promote national goods. It is reported that the headquarters is contracted by a small number of merchants. The term will expire at the end of April this year. It is not known whether there will be open bidding, what the security deposit will be, and how much the annual contracted amount will be. It is requested that details be provided. It is proposed that relevant factories pool funds to bid, which will not affect the department's revenue, and will enable national goods to be sold as much as possible, avoiding long-term monopolies, which is the best of both worlds. This is specially telegraphed for consideration, and a reply is eagerly awaited.</p>

The resolution was that (1) doctors of various departments be solicited, (2) a longevity fund committee be formed, (3) designated member stores be made the association's medicine dispensing locations, and (4) required items be purchased. Finally, the chairman reported that for the winter relief last year, Chairman Yao, Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin, three great philanthropists, warmly supported.
