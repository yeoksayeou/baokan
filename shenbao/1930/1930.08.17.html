<p>自馬立師法實行以後工商交獲其利其法至妙然百妙中尙有一憾厥憾爲何工商之資本須大爲加增也蓋貨物暢銷則出貨須多分期付欵則時日延長出貨旣多時日雙須延長設使資本不足則週轉又不靈便矣</p>
<p>感此困苦後經濟家又細加斟酌欲設法可使工商之資本不須增加而同時又能收分期付欵之效其法旣成咸稱盡善盡美此即銀公司營業之宗旨也</p>
<p>銀公司本爲調劑工商之資本而設使購貨者先出貨值百之卅餘者以期所購爲抵押</p>
<p>品而向銀公司借貸按月攤還誠一舉而三得也</p>
<p>銀公司成立以後商賈售貨可得現銀復</p>
<p>３</p>
<p>以現銀而定現貨輪轉如流是工商之金融均受銀公司調劑之惠也</p>
<p>更有進者銀公司係有組織之機體負完全收賬之責任耳目旣長欠賬者又有欠據可憑當然按月照付逈非欠店賬所可比擬商賈旣得現銀又免去收賬之手續購貨者旣先收用貨物之便利又可分期還本毫無籌撒旦大宗欵項之必要工商興盛國本鞏固其有裨益於社會豈淺鮮哉匯衆銀公司本斯宗旨專爲調劑滬上工商之金融而設惜乎知之者鮮工商未獲用盡其長其始也本爲美國人之組織去年加入大宗華股改爲中美合辦華人方面之營業歸富有商業經騐之華人負責辦理　　滬上貨品之銷售儘可倣效歐美用馬立師</p>

<p>之辦法先付百分之三十餘者以所購爲抵押品向匯衆銀公司借貸以付商賈果如是則貨可暢銷又無收賬之紛繁誠一舉而兩得也</p>
<h3>購物分期付欵法其利益共有十七種</h3>
<p>（１）今日米珠薪桂社會上鉅富者居少數中下資產者實居多數是以高貴物品購者甚少惟行分期付欵法則可推廣其銷路</p>
<p>５</p>
<p>（２）行分期付欵之法營業必可擴張其不行此法者必難與競爭優勝劣敗無待龜下</p>
<p>（３）高貴品物中下資產者未嘗不欲得而利用之但恨無躉欵心有餘而力不足</p>
<p>若許以分期付欵則足以動其購買之念社會上此等人實居多數倘可得其樂於購買自必求超乎供銷路暢旺　　（４）利用期法則顧客必多</p>
<p>（５）人非富有頗難儲蓄能之者百不得一故高貴物品頗難售現分期付欵法則不然蓋利用其將來之進欵也自歐美之商情觀之此法一行則購之者衆造之者疾物旣多矣價目亦因而低廉大約可减百之十至廿五不等</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>（６）歐美各國照此法行之其結果迺增加工價减輕貨值地方興盛尤易得其滿意</p>
<p>（７）利用此法則銷路廣定貨多于是則大宗製造方可產生方可獲利</p>
<p>（８）細查美國於此法未行之先汽車之事業本居第九行後一躍而爲第三今茲所售之汽車百之六十咸賴分期法以惟銷之也</p>
<p>（９）分期付欵法頗可迎合顧客心理故較售現爲易</p>
<p>（１０）考諸歐美各國分期付欵法能使物品廣製廣銷故失業者能得業因而人民康樂地方安寗</p>
<p>（１１）銀公司之殷實及辦理得法者頗能調劑社會上金融故爲商界上重要之機關　　（１２）銀公司之責任重大利息至爲適當有貨皆可抵押童叟均不相欺</p>
<p>（１３）利用此法能補救市面蕭條實爲商業之保障</p>
<p>（１４）分期付欵法無大危險蓋于一年中可期其淸結也</p>
<p>（１５）銀公司之在歐美試有成效銀行界公認其在銀業內實居重要之位置</p>
<p>（１６）售現之商店於市面淸淡之日所發生之危險實大而分期付欵之法則可减輕此種危險</p>

<h3>洋商擴張長江航業</h3>
<p>長江航業歷來以英輪勢力最巨國府雖有收向內河航權之主張而洋商之擴充競爭依然積極進行不稍懈怠近頃英商輪在揚子江內造船跌費爭奪運輸尤不遺餘力此事關係我國航權消長至巨亟爲分誌如下</p>
<p>英商增船近來航運界趨重於快輪熱長江綫內太古怡和率先造强速度輪而原有燃煤江輪將次淘汰太古新建之蕪湖武穴兩船均用柴油引擎速力各在每小時十八里今武穴輪亦將出廠而將長江班之中游下游合成一綫其在滬漢</p>
<p>之下游綫內派定重慶安慶黃浦温州武昌盛京吳淞等七船而於中游綫之滬宜班派定蕪湖武穴大通鄱陽等輪又有漢宜班派定長沙吉安沙市及湘潭等共計十五輪新造船之行期往來一次可快二天至三天而上游之川河內則派定八船至於怡和洋行自今次新江輪寳和落成後計下游派六輪中游派十船上上游派三船從下月起揚子江內太古怡和兩公司擴充至四十二輪行駛</p>
<p>跌費爭業太古公司之長江營業今春進出口貨均有衰退之勢該公司在半月以前力圖挽救始將上游下水貨之運費特別放盤客家貪圖便宜貨運乃頓增該行復又將上海運往長江各埠之出口貨水脚亦援例暗放運率近一星期來該公司之出口貨乃大增在未放盤前每船去貨至多三四千件邇日已增多一倍以上甚有一萬餘件者且上運米糧原由中國江輪裝載者此次因華論停班悉被其奪去該公司之江輪營業頓形起色</p>
<p>添加躉船長江各埠除碼頭以外最重要者爲躉船本年太古公司以十餘萬元之巨資在鎭江漢口等埠又更換容量巨大新躉船多艘均已開云爲爭上下水貨之堆存茲又得聞該公司擬新輪武穴號落成後即將原行之盛京輪改建躉船矣邇來漢口方面因地方戒嚴來貨較少而沿途有該國軍艦保護</p>
<p>綏定復航太古之綏定輪上次在共黨入湘時曾勒索搭客巨額票值十四小時中其買辦楊某收入達三萬餘元後經漢同鄉會控訴昨得確訊楊某已委人四出疎通將勒心票價時所取得女客之金飾等作抵押者已經交回並表示認錯該輪現仍復行湘鄂綫矣</p>

<p>車至西藏路機器已熱灣朝北後始開快車到靜安寺路向西至馬霍路命黃脫眼鏡更命黃脫去白洋紗衫着匪備之藍布衫白洋衫中之開汽車照兩張及洋二十餘元及鑰匙等一併取去黃因無眼鏡不辨路徑惟悉匪恐後有追者走曲折路兩轉將達下車地點前又命脫去皮鞋着拖鞋黃問至何處答至船上到一廠之右下車由二匪挾黃行過廠門灣轉沿河至船船匪未醒匪罵船不傍碼頭而在泥灘之外黃問匪有無跳板匪曰吾背你乃背黃下船船中有一匪（即被捕者）以手槍指黃黃問匪首何人答不知問爾曾當兵否答是問何部答前在馬玉仁部談約三四分鐘年長之匪來其人較年輕者爲黠黃問貴鄉答揚州問船要開否是否往揚州答等潮開杭州問今日陰曆何日答二十一（查二十一日吳淞江三時漲潮）此匪云請放心七日必可自由黃更問匪首何人曰天津人黃謂請渠來匪曰不能來明日派人來請你照稿寫信匪問明日要吃何菜黃答船中地小易病只須粥問要何小菜答無須白粥可飲問鹹蛋要否答要船中陳設極陋黃臥於蓆上有新買之洋磁面盆一新手巾一黃用此面盆爲枕船中空氣甚暢匪婦先煑一盆熱水黃用以揩面揩身後又以開水一杯盛於新蓋碗內黃恐不得出船小解不便未飲至潮來船不開而匪漸慌長者戒少者曰切不可睡極要留心隔半時二人商議僅聞曰二十歲五百歲（其聲甚慌）過卡子（周大僕廟在北新涇東）難極危險其時船屢停屢開及天明匪婦曰他們本要開出去吾勸他們傍在附近以期便於了事其實匪等見岸上到處有六區巡士故不敢開又不敢不動且知卡子之更不易渡耳最後水巡第二分隊用二舢舨來遁者遁捕者捕黃乃出蘇州河畔之匪船有者</p>
<p>小花園警笛初鳴之際時報館樓上辦事員推窗下視以爲汽車撞傷行人乃屬常事更不料有被綁一事迨汽車開出守門者奔上樓報告始大驚駭於是本埠記者或汽車或電話立即分投出發於十五分鐘內遍報華租界公安局捕房一體注意攔緝</p>
<p>車去約半點餘鐘又出不意被汽車帶去之童子兪炳芳忽坐黃包車自南回來時報辦事員立即截住詢其故童曰我始終不明睡熟車上迨至半途被顚簸醒見有五人塞擠車中黃先生在前兩人夾坐左右至新嘉坡路小沙渡路口車停在後之兩人挾黃先生下車向北行前面荒索無人居隱約有船隻幌動車又開四五分鐘又停一人出小洋四角代我雇黃包車回轉我始終不明何事時報辦事員當以此童子甚有嫌疑遂連黃包車夫拘入老閘捕房</p>
<p>老閘捕房對車童二人重詢一過立派探捕西行尋覓久之在新嘉坡路小沙渡路角發見汽車由西探將車開至捕房</p>
<p>在天未明三點鐘時時報辦事員已得悉汽車發見地點按之童子所述料定綁匪必向滬西或滬北匿避將黃君藏於船上乘夜開往他處乃再派六人急駛汽車往四六二區公安局及沿蘇州河閘北水巡第二分隊曹家渡北新涇水巡隊二派出所要求立刻分派水陸巡警出發巡查</p>
<p>最後時報辦事員等料定匪踪必在六區轄境即於四點一刻時再赴六區公安局時區長任履平並巡官徐濤等方自外間搜查一度回署上床均僅二三十分鐘者投以刺立出接見互談之下區長亦認爲匪踪必在小沙渡河中或沿岸草棚內乃命巡官等全體立刻準備各官警聞命盡從床上躍起莫不精神抖擻一轉瞬間準備已畢有一警士束帶略遲立被區長訓斥其辦案精神於此可見五時許武裝官警即躍登時報開往之汽車疾馳逕往蘇州河一帶施其搜查之工作正晨光熹微時也出發時區長復授巡官等以機宜並囑先往水巡分隊報請協助</p>
<p>又當六區官警第一次偵查時署中人盡數出發僅留一門崗一聽差任署長亦親出指揮至四時許始返一夜中所睡不足半小時勤奮殊屬少見</p>
<p>市公安局水巡隊閘北第二分隊巡官李文漢於出事後三小時半許得訊即督率長警乘汽船由新閘橋西光復路出發向西查抄同時曹家渡浜北該隊派出所及周家橋江蘇省水上公安隊亦各派警乘劃子向東出發無論停泊開行之船隻一律搜檢李巡官搜至潭子灣地方時天已黎明而水巡隊曹家渡派出所經六區官警之咨照亦已出發至七時半許巡長馬獻庭率警郝萬欽劉通元謝長金袁景隆等五人趕至小沙渡東首福新麵粉第三廠碼等頭（南岸）附近見有江北小船一艘前面平板後有小棚上有一拖髪辮上身赤膊下身着藍布袴之男子急急解纜馬巡長等遂料定爲匪船無疑即疾馳追逐該匪知不能脫乃將船復靠岸邊率一七八歲之孩童上岸飛奔而逸時匪船上又有一婦人上岸圖遁被水警亟趨登船拘獲另一男匪跳出船篷身穿藍布衫袴面多麻點狀甚凶惡適六區公安局巡官及大隊長警在岸上搜查已至將其拘獲並在身上搜得子彈一排子彈夾二隻連同船板上實彈手槍二支恐艙中尙有餘黨水警乃向水中開槍三響示威孰知艙中並無餘黨而黃君果在其內蓋此時水陸巡警羣集匪已着慌不敢拒捕也</p>
<p>據黃君言當水巡近匪船時年長之赤膊匪徒及匪婦早已在船面由年少者（即被獲之周五看守而是時見少者忽將手槍藏匿衣堆中走上艙面黃君本擬將此手槍擊斃此匪後恐爲查者誤會又因未明年長之匪究已逃走抑尙在船頭中恐拒捕時或中流彈故靜伏平臥於艙中後於船隙中見匪等已捕乃大聲聲明爲被綁者某人登船搜捕者之巡士郝萬欽劉通元袁景隆謝長金四人及巡長馬獻庭因問是否時報總理答是乃扶之出船坐舢板而出險巡士巡長等當時頗出力黃親見彼等額汗如雨也</p>
<p>十時許曹家渡水巡派出所乃用小汽船護送黃伯惠君至新閘橋西閘北第二水巡分隊轉送南市關橋公安局水巡總隊拘獲之二匪同時解送汽船從蘇州河東行折入黃浦因逆風逆水進行殊難而時報辦事員等均趨水巡總隊候接徐季奭隊長得訊招待甚周到時黃君上身穿黑香雲紗短衫白洋布袴子赤足穿皮鞋而黑香雲紗短衫乃借自水巡隊隊員者蓋本身所穿衣襪已被綁匪脫去且眼鏡亦被取去與徐隊長等會晤並述被綁與脫險之經過後水巡隊船上之電話連續而至蓋皆係探詢黃君之安全也</p>
<p>十二部半黃君易新衣偕同徐隊長時報辦事員等坐汽車至公安總局晤偵緝隊長第三科長等相談甚久至下午三時許方始返寓拘獲之二匪由偵緝隊盤詰一過男匪供稱周五二十四歲揚州人對於綁架並看守黃伯惠之事直認不諱尙有同夥在逃不知去向詰之女匪供李王氏在三十八歲阜寗人祗稱由匪雇用專爲搖船每月得洋二百元已守候二月有餘等語隊長盧英當命連同起出證物一併申解市公安局訊究聞市公安局以事出租界此項人犯明後日須轉解公共租界特區地方法院辦理容再續誌此事發生有一點頗滋疑慮即童子兪炳芳見汽車空時即來橫臥車內若使無此童子則當時黃君汽車可立即開出綁匪决不能下手此童子在捕房供因天熱貪圖風凉故此童子憶先釋出將來仍須傳詢也</p>
<p>發見汽車後捕房探捕在車上拾得一元之中國銀行鈔票已撕去其半推測綁匪意在恐嚇事主不圖反爲水巡等拘獲二匪</p>
<p>此次破案之迅速閘北第二水巡隊曹家渡派出所巡長馬獻庭巡士郝萬欽劉通元袁景隆謝長金等與六區公安局任署長巡官徐濤合署長警等趕夜搜捕出力殊多而老閘捕房中西探推納惠爾考克司華探長尤阿根探目崔誠克梁成玉邱思九等諸君亦極勤勞附誌於此</p>
<p>記者按黃君家道平庸以報紙對國民社會有密切之關係故不惜四處借移欵項維持時報迄已六年心力交瘁凡稍知公益者無不敬佩其爲人乃竟有此匪徒之謀巡捕之縱幾乎遇險可爲一歎</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>一得之言</h3>
<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>現代的婚姻市塲也像標金市塲一樣發生極大的變化靑年男女們以其一身的幸福作孤注之一擲失敗者眞不知多少　　　　結婚的女人可分爲兩大類一種是妻子一種是單純的已婚女子妻子以家庭雜務爲己任躬親操作把丈夫當作丈夫單純的已婚女子天天在外面外不知烹飪爲何物把丈夫當作伊的消遣品</p>
<p>未來的女子和未來的男子結婚起來一定要訂立一個與商業上相同的合同去保障他倆一身或暫時的幸福</p>
<p>假使男子們能把他妻子看得像女友一般而妻子也把丈夫看得像上司一樣那末家庭之間可不聞勃谿之聲</p>
<p>有人說兩個人假使同愛一樣東西那末他們倆就會互相愛慕但是這句話只能應用於男女二人間一男與一男之間或是一女與一女之間是辦不到的</p>
<p>男子的一生至少須有二個女子一個是妻子一個是愛人一個是普通的同伴一個是假期內的消遣</p>
<p>無妻的男子可以分爲三大類別第一類是良心上的無妻者他想他不應該娶妻第二類是天生的無妻者他沒有這心腸去娶妻第三類是自制的無妻者他决定不想娶妻的</p>
<p>買一匹馬要看它的樣子皮色年齡和大小但是娶一個妻子决沒有這般容易外貌以外尙須看穿伊的心腸</p>
<p>結婚好像是一面鏡子從這裏面可以看到妻子或是丈夫對於你的眞正面目</p>

<h3>西瓜趣記</h3>
<p>— 顏也</p>
<p>如焚天氣啖西瓜一樂也連日剖瓜大嚼憶及西瓜之趣事種種錄付本刊以供讀者談資</p>
<p>吾常習慣客來餉以瓜必取其半中揷金屬之叉或匙任客掘食苟分成小塊以餉之則不敬也有陳姓子去春取滬上某氏女婦暑中某日有客蒞臨陳命女取瓜女細切置盤中捧出陳見之大恚以客在欲言而止客去急告女敬客須取瓜之半不可細切也女頷之翌日陳之公司中同事來者十餘人女以前日之失敬將家中所有西瓜悉剖而爲二細計客數猶不足急遣僕役由篤篤戶購取之旣而捧瓜出以爲今日當夫意矣詎陳又大恚暗嘆其愚不可及迨後衆客一一去召女責之謂瓜固不可細切但事有經權客衆而需瓜多或不足則剖瓜取瓤盛瓤於碗可矣又安可視客少時人必半瓜也且今日之瓜咸大如斗客多不能盡狼藉滿桌客必不感汝之敬且將笑汝之愚爲不可及也女曰吾固不識此鄉習俗汝曷不先告我而今責人也且今日之事正承汝昨日之敎耳陳曰入門問俗新婦所應爾類此者正多汝其識之女猶欲語適其姑出乃罷</p>
<p>曩在飛虹學校冬日大雪紛紛如飛絮有王生桂英忽携來半個西瓜笑置余案頭曰今日天寒西瓜性冷正應時品余以爲手製品不之顧生曰非　鼎特洋貨耳略一移目果覺非僞肉紅子黑試取小塊入口其冷若冰與常瓜無異也笑向何從來生謂乃一日人由彼國携來以其二贈吾父故吾曰東洋貨也同事問知咸集各取嘗之大爲笑樂冬日大啖西瓜一趣事也</p>
<p>憶小學敎育家楊聘漁先生曾謂西瓜乃動物非植物也問其故則曰西瓜中有娘（瓤諧音）有子娘且有名曰紅娘曰雪娘曰黃娘俱香艷無匹西瓜旣有母子則非動物而何聞者軒渠</p>
<p>今歲吾校工藝敎師令某級生各製一西瓜法以敗紙揉之爲球外粘以紙甚厚更取色繪之儼然瓜矣纍纍滿桌幼稚生見之皆大觀喜而垂涎欲滴師告以紙製不信圍觀如故乃令捧取則質輕若球始各悟焉然去時猶屢屢返顧雖已知其不可食而仍覺其可愛可玩也</p>
<h3>正潤君藥名瑣談</h3>

<h3>法國近事</h3>
<p>— 六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>自倫敦海軍會議意大利堅持法意海軍勢力均等以來法意國交日益險惡且自後兩國新聞互相攻擊兩國政府各走極端地中海大戰眞有爆發即在目前之槪現在此嚴重之形勢雖如暴風雨之倐然馳過但其中情形有可資紀述者茲略爲言之</p>
<p>當倫敦海會閉幕之後未久法外交總長白里安及英外相安得生意外相格朗地等因出席國際聯盟之便曾相聚於日內瓦於意法海軍問題有所談議當時决定以後巴黎羅馬兩政府先用書面討論俟有頭緒再開會議不料事過不久意首相慕沙利尼即在Livourne　Folrence　Milan等處演說發表示威言論對於法國爲露督的攻擊法外長白里安因當即聲明處此情勢之下討論礙難進行於是法意談判宣布無期停頓此時國際間空氣嚴重已達極點法意兩國報紙雜誌已有研究彼此戰鬥力之軍事方面之文字發表其情形險惡可以想見</p>
<p>不獨此也慕沙尼又於United　Press報刊布一文對於法外長白里安發表之歐洲聯盟創議大加指摘且揚言歐洲聯盟之實現非俟現在各國條約先經一番嚴密之審核與改訂不可一時輿論大譁竟有謂意德間之有相當結合者幸其後意外部送達法外部關於歐洲聯盟創議之覆文措辭較慕沙利尼之言論爲婉於是人心稍安</p>
<p>至七月十日法外長白里安在衆議員外交委員會表示法政府對於意法問題之態度空氣乃更和緩蓋白里安聲明法政府當以全力維持和平現在歐洲無戰爭之可能云</p>
<p>最近更由法國提議法意兩國相約至本年底止實行海軍休假停止建造新艦於是數月來之種種謠言暫歸平靜現在問題乃在法意兩國有無和平誠意能否相讓步法意問題前途蓋全恃此半年內兩國外交家之努力矣</p>

<h3>漢花市轉趨强勢</h3>
<p>三品紗轉高美棉有回勢</p>
<p>美棉一角二分陣綫業已跌破實以南方農業套賣測其形勢仍在續跌中然本埠多數買方心理因美棉連跌六日或有轉漲之望仍購進加碼且天氣較爲惡劣始終不肯放鬆但照美棉狀况論之仍難立定實以四兩關口一破有一部獲利者抵補市勢由此而緊廠商態度甚冷對於新棉毫無問津因陳花存底充足故云</p>

<p>紐約十五日來電報告一週中之棉市云旱災所影響於中西兩棉帶之程度至微棉貨市面又形不振就政府之估計報告再加以陳花之滾存即此已足表示供給之豐厚故上週棉花交易所之市價逐步下落旱區一部分業獲暴雨足令原棉受益但大部分則仍未得救也據聞合作公會已定以現價之百分之七十五作貸債之基本而棉花維持會則已購進八十萬包並將於上季之䞉餘額中再進一百三十萬包購進之後均將爲合作公會所囤持也目前棉廠對於其未來之需要購進較薄棉價業到一九二六年大豐收之最低紀錄但市上對於秋季之套賣價在一角二分或以上之時是否能吸收則猶須待證也附週末統計如左（單位千包）</p>

<h3>米市微轉堅穩</h3>

<p>滬南河下計到來船八九號市銷尙可常帮白粳凋零市與北市相仿祇交易寥寥耳蘇同白粳略有抵申買胃因貨次不甚爽化價格暫守原盤南帮薄稻到三四號本街進進意不弱行情挺定變元由緊而平到貨少而消貨淡價無榮辱全日各檔一律呈堅定之勢</p>
<h3>洋米銷活價平</h3>

<h3>粉市已呈僵局</h3>
<p>多空均難下手</p>
<p>昨日粉市又見挺住以洋麥報價又好五六角不等致業內外人心帶緊觀目下市場之局勢彷彿已呈僵局因實銷不暢小麥亦未見廉致大部分已交易均無形擱起而廠與廠之間心思又未一致看小者利用實銷之呆滯不願補空看大者則依據小麥昂貴依然遇機吸收雙方均以勢力相抗爭市面自少途徑可尋也惟以情勢言此後如銷塲一活實有漲則速跌則微之可能也結果八十二正月份較前日各奸七厘半九月份好二厘半十月份不動十一月份好一分</p>
<h3>麥市近俏遠定</h3>
<p>昨日期麥轉趨堅勁之象以洋麥報價又好一般空戶自又不得不補本月份以不久又須交割凡無現貨之客戶祗好隨時補進遠期曾有幾盤亦呈俏利惟後以內地多頭回出故堅而復定結果本月份較前日漲四分九十月份漲二分十一月份漲一分十二月一月份漲二分現貨祗貨豐辦進四千餘包餘均擯住不辦故各檔開價似較短一二二分開台兒莊瑤灣信陽州漢口麥共四千餘包云</p>

<h3>歌謠論集</h3>
<p>— 增敭</p>
<p>鍾敬文編</p>
<p>在素所忽視民間文藝的中國於不久之前竟能在混亂的出版界中突現出這樣一本專門研究歌謠的論文集委實值得我們異外的驚喜與注意要曉得所謂最珍貴的民間文藝除了民間所遺留下來的故事之外其次占了重要位置的當然要推崇於最古代就發生了的民間歌謠了近代從文人手裏所創製出來的詩歌實際它底形成是影響於古代的歌謠這是誰也不能有所疑義即使相洋的詩歌也是導源於最古代的文學原形民謠舞這是上古人民歡聚慶祝或是降神時間的一種娛樂其中包含着言語音樂動作三個要素隨了這三個要素的發展便形成了所謂現代文藝範圍上佔着重要地位的詩照這樣看來詩歌旣是文藝上最典型的藝術那麼最單純最沉摯的感情表現的民間歌謠它所有的價值由此可知一斑的了</p>
<p>原來民間歌謠即是蘊蓄着美的成分而以言語表現的在原始時代尙沒有文字的發生所以這些美的情緒祇有一般平民由口頭互相的傳述因爲它充滿了靈活的生命而具有眞正不朽的價值故能遺留到這樣的永久在這些偉大的古代民謠中可以顯然地看出有的是驚異自然的偉大有的是讚美神紙的顯赫有的是述戰鬥的遺蹟有的是詠士女的嬌艷有的是悲嘆婦女的被壓迫有的是暴露貴族的作威作福有的是民族個性的表現這都是美底情感的要求當然是很明白澈然的但是關於上述的表現各式各樣的民間歌謠在少數愛好民俗文學的人大都有所蒐集這項歌謠的專坊間時常可以發現一兩本或是吳歌或是粵謳這當然也是一種好的現象不過專門精心研究的關於歌謠的論文據我個人所知道要算是這本歌謠集爲最初本了內容又這樣的豐富而完美委實值得我們愼重的介紹於讀者之前的</p>
<p>這裏面收集的每篇論著大都是專門研究民俗文學的學者的心血結晶也可以說是集各民俗學專家之大成它底價值實不是普通的言辭能夠形容盡緻據編者自己在序文中述這裏所收入的討論談述推究的文章首先是發表於北京大學的歌謠研究會所刊行的歌謠週刊斷續兩年共出版九十六期終於因了要改成國學門週刊之故把它宣告停止了在九十六期的週刊中除了兩三千首以上的歌謠外關於此項論文共登載了一二百篇這樣專一的研究而獲得如此洋洋大觀的成績眞個值得我們引起無上的企羨可是因爲經濟的關係該刊每期祇印了五百份附在北大日刊送發所以流傳在外邊者絕少就是當時參預這個運動最力的幾位學者手頭也很少的保存着它而沒有完整無缺的篇章了這的確是一椿最大的憾事現在好了鍾君犧牲了幾許的精力在百忙中勉強偷一點空把它挑選出數十篇編彙成這個厚厚的一本集子使未曾見到那歌謠週刊的人都能夠一飽眼福補足他們自己所認爲憾事的缺陷這的確含有重大的意義鍾君這樣熱心於民俗文學的研究與提倡更使我們底佩服之至了</p>
<p>編者對於此項文章總共劃分了三類第一緝是研究與討論第二輯是各地歌謠叙述第三輯是書評與書序因爲文章的分類實在是一件怪不容易的事在編者雖然很謙虛的認爲是粗略地給安劃分一下但已使我們翻檢起來便利得許多並不覺得發現有所不大妥當之處</p>
<p>這裏實在篇篇都是很可寳貴的珠玉但多數的執筆者又是對於此道頗有探討或富有熱愛的人如嘉白的童謠底藝術的價值所持之論點實是異常透澈他底見解更是針針見血扼要備至的了</p>
<p>世界各國從古以來沒有一國無國民獨特的民謠與童謠一國的音樂畢竟都用童謠民謠作基礎而發達這就表現出各國音樂上的特徵來童謠民謠可以說是創作一表現國民性的音樂底原素民謠童謠的產出大槪不是成於一個樂匠之手也不是在何代何時誰創出來這是經過許多人底適當改訂並得萬人的贊同才能傳世也就是一些無虛僞的國民性的流露這才是時代的反映假使民謠之中除了國民性那便不能認爲有何等的價值了童謠也是如此不過從歌章上講民謠多少是大人唱而童謠則適合於兒童生活所唱這就是兩者的差異點</p>
<p>我們看了上面徵引的一段話可以知道作者研究的入微論童的藝術的價值他先把勢必研究到民謠的一點詳細的叙述一下這是因爲童謠與謠不能絕對分離在學問上也難嚴密劃定兩者的區域照其兩者底形態和結構並沒有十分不同的地方作者在這種劃分的困難之中居然將自己研究的心得把這兩者的形成與關係略有發揮這就是說一論到童謠當然要牽連着民謠的了同昌作者也是爲了所以要研究童謠實際是要發揚一國的國民性爲研究的起點這富有民族意識的論斷更形使我們要拍案讚嘆了</p>
<p>其次要說到王肇鼎的那篇怎樣去研究和整理歌謠巨論實在具有偉大的價值其中關於歌謠的性質很適當的分爲四段來論及一歌謠是眞正民間的自然文學二歌謠是一處民族思想的結晶三歌謠沒有一定的記載四歌謠沒有一定的作者同時作者雙把研究一地方的歌謠應先具爲常識也分着三段來儘其量的發揮一關於地理方面的二關於人文方面的三關於社會方面的尤其是這第三節持論非常精密實爲難能可貴的潛心之作</p>
<p>歌謠的產生社會現象所負的影響最大我們都知道歌謠的產生是以民族的同性爲立足點以外界的刺激爲發動機那麼外界的刺激是什麼不是現社會現象麼再進一層說同性是由於自然的環境地勢所釀成的刺激是由於人爲的環境社會現象所造成的你要追究源首尾都不應有所偏廢所以爲澈底的研究歌謠起見你又不得不把牠所處的社會現象仔細地審查一下子在審查社會現象的中間我以爲又應該分做兩部一部是過去的一部是現在的這兩部中都含有政敎風化等不過要你把過去的和現在的合成一有系統的審查就罷了</p>
<p>因爲社會現象是歌謠的引點或生點所以上面的一段話確實非常的重要對於最初研究歌謠的人更有許多的帮助是很精密的參考資料並且作者在最後將怎樣研究和整理它的方法也有深切的指示這是個中心的問題然當應該分外的注意第一是解釋字句關於這一層方言便要佔着最重要的位置第二窺發眞意關於這一層民性便可給吾們十二分助力字句明白眞意發見之後第三步手續便是分類作者對於分類的標準更是精密異常是從政治上歷史上敎育上風俗上娛樂上表情上與及其它的種種方面來確定這一地方民族的情性是如何過去精神上的成績是如何現在精神上的景象是如何並且又述及我們應當用什麼方法去改造啓發指引和扶助他們再從政治上的敎育上的就可以明白他們所惡何在所喜何在他們的長處何在短處何在給治理這地方的人和敎育這地方人一個極好的借鑑因源導流事自易爲而有功了所以作者理想中研究和整理歌謠的給果竟把中國各地民族的特性精細的從上列的分類中區別的申述出來較以往一般民俗學的歌謠分類詳盡許多又把歌謠對於社會和國家都有極密切的關係也很切實的論斷着這步工作非對歌謠有深刻研究的人實不能做我們的作者王君竟能這樣的做到了</p>
<p>常惠譯的那篇北京的歌謠序也是一篇重要的文字在本文的開端就把作者自己深信讀者能從本書可以得到的益處先明白的指示第一是能得別處不易見的文或短語第二明白懂得中國人日常生活的狀况詳情第三覺得眞的詩歌可以從中國平民的歌找出由此也可以使們看出研究歌謠的重要而且這些歌謠是樸實而可感動人的在對於中國人</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>的憂樂祇有一點知識的人更可看作爲詩的作者曾道樣的說我也要引讀者的注意於這些歌謠所用的詩法因爲他們乃是不懂文言的不學的所作的現出一種與歐洲諸國相類的詩法與意大利的詩幾乎完全相合根於這種歌謠和民族的感情新的一種民族的詩或者可以發生出來作者這種偉大的希望實在要賴現在一般研究民俗學的學者加鞭的努力尤其在我們中華人民有如一盤散沙的中國否則這希望是不會實現的</p>
<p>本集所包括的研究與討論計三十篇每篇都是洋洋大觀的巨文如周作人的中國民歌的價值鍾敬文的歌謠的一種表現法黃樸的歌謠與政治楊世淸的從歌謠看我國婦女的地位劉達九的從搜集歌謠得來的經騐和佛偈子的介紹家斌譯的英國搜集歌謠的運動諸文都是篇篇有再三細閱的文章各地歌謠叙述計六篇書評與書序計五篇有的關於海外民歌的介紹尤爲珍貴旣可使我們知道國外的民歌與中國的民歌底共同點又可以明白其它國家的民族性與人情風俗等等實堪使我們注意的</p>
<p>其中還引用着許多首不易多得的情歌在讀者看了這些似乎枯燥的論文再來一讀這些美麗的情歌不覺思想爲之煥然一新總之這裏面所收彙的文字篇篇都是很可寳貴的珠寶各個執筆者所研究的心血結晶對於這本偉大的歌謠論集希望讀者尤其是愛好民間文學者不要忽視才好</p>

<h3>Payment by Installments for Purchases: Seventeen Benefits</h3>
<p>(1) Today, rice is like pearls and firewood like cinnamon. The wealthy are few in society, while those with middle and lower assets are the majority. Therefore, few purchase expensive goods. However, implementing installment payments can expand sales.</p>

<p>(2) Implementing installment payments will undoubtedly expand business. Those who do not adopt this method will inevitably struggle to compete. Superiority and inferiority are obvious.</p>
<p>(3) Among expensive goods, those with middle and lower assets invariably desire to obtain and utilize them, but they regret lacking the funds for a lump sum payment.</p>
<p>If installment payments are permitted, it will be enough to motivate their purchasing intentions. This type of person is the majority in society. If their willingness to purchase can be obtained, it will surely surpass supply and demand, leading to thriving sales. (4) Utilizing installment payments will definitely attract many customers.</p>

Installment payments are different because they utilize future income. Judging from the business conditions in Europe and America, once this method is implemented, many will buy, and manufacturers will produce quickly. As goods increase, prices will also decrease accordingly, roughly by 10 to 25 percent.</p>

<p>(7) Utilizing this method expands sales and secures many orders, enabling large-scale manufacturing and profit.</p>
<p>(8) Upon careful examination, before this method was implemented in the United States, the automobile industry was ninth. After implementation, it jumped to third. Currently, 60 percent of the automobiles sold rely on installment payments to facilitate sales.</p>
<p>(9) Installment payments can cater to customer psychology, making sales easier than cash sales.</p>
<p>(10) According to observations in European and American countries, installment payments enable widespread production and sales of goods, allowing the unemployed to find work, resulting in happy people and peaceful localities.</p>

<p>Jinan. The Central Army occupied Jinan with swiftness and thunder, and the process is as follows: Initially, the Jin army held a military meeting on the afternoon of the 14th, and the result of the meeting decided on a total retreat and the construction of a retreat protection array at the location of Eight Kier south of Jinan to protect the main forces retreating to the north bank of the Yellow River. The tactic was to both defend and prevent. On the morning of the 15th, the important left-wing array had been shattered by the Central Army, and the Jin army had completely collapsed, only defending Jinan for a short time before retreating. The Jin army had originally decided to retreat completely by the 15th and hand over Jinan City on the 16th. Unexpectedly, the Central Army entered the city in the afternoon of the 15th. The Jin army was cut off before half of it had retreated. This was the greatest loss suffered since the start of the war.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The German-Polish Negotiation</h3>
<p>Recently, the two biggest international disputes are between Turkey and Persia, and between Germany and Poland. I have already briefly discussed the dispute between Turkey and Persia. Today, the dispute between Germany and Poland also has some value to discuss.</p>
<p>After Poland's restoration, the most difficult problem to solve was the border issue, and among the border negotiations, the eastern border with Russia and the western border with Germany were the most difficult to solve. Therefore, the issue of the Russian-Polish border in the Paris Peace Conference did not result in a conclusion until the Treaty of Riga was signed, which only barely decided the matter. Although the German-Polish border issue was agreed upon at the Paris Peace Conference and stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles, the Germans already expressed dissatisfaction at that time. Various indignant remarks were repeatedly seen in the newspapers at that time because many of the regions in eastern Germany that were assigned to Poland were important. Therefore, the Germans believed that the sacrifice was too great and expressed dissatisfaction. However, at that time, the Paris Peace Conference really had no way to satisfy the Germans. Recently, the Germans have repeatedly revealed their desire to revise the treaty, and Italy, which is on good terms with them, has also echoed this, indicating that this problem is likely to cause unrest again. Furthermore, as evidenced by the facts, the Germans recently protested to the Polish government by sending a note regarding the Polish guards invading German territory and alleging that the investigation by the joint committee was unfair. Now, the Poles are also protesting to the German government due to the remarks made by high-ranking officials in the former German-occupied territories regarding the eastern border issue, which contain hostile intent. Germany, in turn, rejected the protest, stating that the official's remarks did not violate the treaty. In short, the Germans are constantly thinking about restoring their old territories, while Poland is constantly thinking about preventing German aggression. Therefore, although this kind of negotiation may seem to be just a sudden clash of words, the hidden resentment can easily erupt at any time. If nothing happens, that's fine, but if something does happen, this kind of disagreement will be one end of the fuse.</p>

Yan and Feng, facing intellectual and physical exhaustion, are colluding with the traitor Wang Jingwei, attempting to lure the communist bandits in Hunan and Jiangxi to carry out massacres in order to disrupt the rear of our righteous army. Now, the communist bandits are fleeing Hunan and Jiangxi, and Yan's treacherous plot has become an empty promise. At this time, Yan and Feng's last hope is that the Northeast will not send troops. Otherwise, they will be like fish in a boiling pot, barely surviving. Sir, you bear the heavy responsibility of the Party and the nation, and your patriotic zeal will not allow the traitors to grow stronger, leaving the people in dire straits. Therefore, we urgently request you to expedite the dispatch of troops to suppress the rebellion in order to secure the Party and the nation and to live up to public expectations."

<h3>Crisis in Northwestern India</h3>
<p>The Authorities Deploy Heavy Troops, Temporarily Announce Martial Law</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 15th - One British battalion and three Indian battalions have been transferred from Jalandhar to Rawalpindi, north of Shah-i-Sharif, to maintain order. Today, the authorities issued a communique stating that the situation is extremely critical. The enemy is using tall crops to conceal their movements. A crowd of approximately 1,200 enemies, divided into small groups, are advancing rapidly along mountain passes and walled gardens. British troops are engaging them, but the obstacles posed by the crops are making it difficult to achieve success. Villagers are greedy for looting and are apparently supplying the enemy with food and shelter. However, the garrisons stationed in Shah-i-Sharif and Kohat are adequately dealing with the enemy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 15th - Two air squadrons joined the offensive yesterday to occupy several caves on the edge of the Bin Khalil plain held by the Afridi people. The offensive is still ongoing. Aircraft also cooperated with Indian cavalry to clear the enemy from caves and the southern region of Shah-i-Sharif. It is reported that the number of enemies has been greatly reduced. On Tuesday and Wednesday, British troops conducted aerial attacks over the Kuran Valley to drive out the tribes of the Masozai and Warakzai, causing heavy casualties. The tribes that attacked the supply depots and villages in the Kuran Valley have now retreated into the mountains.</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 15th - Martial law has been declared in Shah-i-Sharif and neighboring areas.

He also stated that he declared martial law at the request of local authorities. The order includes provisions for the establishment of special courts, but he hopes that there will be no need to establish such courts. As soon as the situation stabilizes, he will immediately revoke martial law.</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 16th - The martial law order in Shah-i-Sharif stipulates that anyone who communicates with the enemy or obstructs the actions of government troops will be punished according to Indian criminal law, and those who harbor or protect the enemy will be subject to imprisonment for more than ten years or a fine.</p>

<h3>Details of the Japanese Air Force Expansion Plan</h3>
<p>China News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - The Navy is urgently seeking to expand and improve its air force. The specifics of the plan are as follows: [T13]1[/T] Establishment of 23 new squadrons, one of which will be equipped with Zeppelins. The total cost is 72 million yuan, and the annual maintenance cost is 36 million yuan. [T13]2[/T] Tripling the number of aircraft carried on aircraft carriers to maximize their loading capacity. The number of carrier-based aircraft will also be tripled.

<h3>He Yingqin Presides Over Communist Suppression Affairs in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>To Launch a Large-Scale Suppression Campaign After Troops are Assembled</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence - The three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi have long been plagued by bandits. Zhu and Mao disturbed Jiangxi, He Long disturbed Hubei, and Peng Dehuai and Huang Gonglue disturbed Hunan. Suppressing them in one place only caused them to flee to another. Recently, Peng, Huang, and other factions captured Changsha, although it was soon recovered. The local loss was significant, and the vitality of the region was severely damaged. Peng and others then occupied Pingfu, remotely linked to the communist forces of Zhu and Mao in Wanzai, constituting an organized and planned action. The authorities are paying close attention to this, and the National Government has clearly ordered He Yingqin, Director of the Wuhan Pacification Headquarters, to be fully responsible for the Communist suppression affairs in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. After receiving the order, He immediately prepared a plan and telegraphed it to the National Government and Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek for review, setting a deadline of one month for complete suppression. Initially, it was planned to establish an agency, but to save expenses, this was temporarily not established. Only an office attached to the Pacification Headquarters will be responsible for everything. As for the troops assigned to suppress the Communists, Hubei will provide approximately six divisions, Hunan approximately five divisions, and Jiangxi approximately four divisions, all under the command and dispatch of He. He has now telegraphed to various places to report on his assumption of office. The original telegram is as follows: "I have just received a telegram from the Civil Affairs Department of the National Government conveying an order from the National Government stating that Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi have long been areas where communist bandits emerge. The country has been troubled and troop deployments have been frequent. While suppressing the rebellion, the Communists have not been eliminated. Recently, the rebellious Yan, Feng, and others occupied territory and sent party members to various places to incite unrest, making the Communist bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi spread like wildfire. Every city that is captured is subjected to burning, killing, and extermination, which is inhumane. The recent disaster in Changsha is particularly heartbreaking. The government is concerned about the peace and tranquility of the three provinces and hopes to save our people from suffering. It is urgent to eliminate all these ugly elements. Therefore, He Yingqin, Director of the Pacification Headquarters, is specially appointed to be responsible for all Communist suppression affairs in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. The troops stationed in each province will be under the control and command of the Director, and all Communists in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi must be quickly suppressed to show the Party's and the country's determination to quell the chaos and protect the people. This order, and other matters, should be reported back. I will respectfully obey the order, carefully plan, and implement it step by step once the troops are assembled, hoping to eliminate the bandit scourge and live up to expectations. Only through talent and heavy responsibility can we achieve quick results. The country and the local areas will benefit greatly. I, He Yingqin, bow (August 15th)."</p>
<h3>Metropolitan Citizens' Anti-Communist Rally</h3>
<p>The Nanjing City Party Headquarters convened representatives from all levels of party headquarters and citizens of the capital at 9:00 AM on the 16th in the First Park to hold an anti-communist citizens' rally. More than 2,000 people attended. Huang Zhongxiang, Chairman of the Municipal Executive Committee, reported on the various crimes committed by the Communist Party in poisoning the people and the significance of the meeting. Zhou Aoshan, a representative from Hunan, reported that the Communist Party was rampant in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, using these three provinces as the base of the Soviet government. The suffering of the people was beyond description. The catastrophe in Changsha, Liuyang, Pingjiang, Liling, Yueyang and other places in Hunan was unprecedented. The methods of the Communist Party are nothing more than burning, killing, kidnapping, and looting. All government offices, large and small institutions, schools, churches, and brick and tile houses in the countryside must be burned to the ground. People are killed in four categories: (1) those who are relatively fat; (2) those who wear long gowns; (3) those who have beards; and (4) those who wear glasses. After the massacre in Changsha, there were more than 1,100 corpses lying on the streets. Many of the kidnapped people are still fleeing and dare not return to Hunan, so it is difficult to count the number of people who have been kidnapped. The method of looting is to tie up and carry away gold, silver, and soft goods. The heavy objects are forced to be looted by the poor. It is even more shocking that the bandit army forces anyone over the age of eight to join the party as a probationary member wherever they go, and tattoos them with indelible symbols so that they cannot escape for the rest of their lives, making it impossible to distinguish between good and bad. There is also the so-called Black Army, which is the reserve team of the Communist Party. The inspectors check the degree of burning and killing as the level of qualification. Those who can kill their fathers, brothers, and elders can get a higher position. When the Communist Party was about to retreat from Changsha on August 5, they collected all the public and private water dragons and store kerosene in one place, preparing to pour the kerosene into the water dragons and spray it all over the city, and then set it on fire to turn the provincial capital into ashes. If the central army had entered the city two or three hours later, the people would have been wiped out. Fang Zhizhen, a representative of the British branch, reported that the Communist Party regards China as the first base in the Far East and Singapore in Nanyang as the second base. The reason why it can operate overseas is that the propaganda of the imperialists against our party is overly suppressed and cannot be made public, which makes it difficult to proceed. Therefore, the Communist Party has room for activities. Chen Yiyun, a representative of women's organizations, finished her speech. The chairman announced the proposals of the conference: (1) Request the central government to send a general to thoroughly suppress the communist bandits in Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces, and severely arrest the rebellious elements such as Wang Jingwei, Yan Xishan, and Feng Yuxiang who collude with the communist bandits and harm Hunan. (2) Send a telegram to the whole country to expose the crimes of rebellious elements such as Wang Jingwei, Yan Xishan, and Feng Yuxiang who collude with communist bandits to harm the country and the people. (3) Request the central government to send a letter to the National Government ordering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inform the governments of all countries of the situation in Hunan where rebellious elements such as Wang Jingwei, Yan Xishan, and Feng Yuxiang collude with communist bandits. (4) Request the central government to send a letter to the National Government requesting the governments of all countries to recognize the brutality of the Communist Party as the public enemy of mankind, and to quickly order their diplomatic officials stationed in China not to have any relations with the rebellious elements, etc., and not to treat them as political prisoners. (5) Send a telegram of condolences to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and the generals and soldiers fighting against the rebellion in the front. (6) Send a telegram to Commander Zhang of the Northeast urging him to send troops to fight against the rebellion as soon as possible. (7) Send a telegram to the public opinion circles across the country to uphold justice, denounce the rebellion, eliminate the communist bandits, support the central government, and promote unification to save China. The above seven cases were unanimously passed on the spot. Then the representative of the Hunan Fellow Villagers Association proposed that the disaster in Hunan Province was due to He Jian's improper measures and should be punished by the National Government, which was also passed. Then they shouted slogans and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Aircraft to Jiangxi and Hunan Border to Bomb Bandits</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The communist bandits Zhu De and Mao Zedong are retreating towards the border of Hunan in two routes from Fengxin and Gao'an. According to news from the fellow villagers associations in various counties in western Jiangxi, the Zhu-Mao bandit troops number approximately 20,000, with thousands of guns and extremely short ammunition. Their fake 3rd, 4th, and 42nd armies, one along the Rui River via Shanggao towards Wanzai, and the other from Fengxin and Jing'an towards Yifeng, on the 8th captured Shanggao and on the 9th captured Yifeng. Both left and right wings are concentrating towards Wanzai. According to military intelligence yesterday, the fake 3rd Army of the Zhu-Mao bandits is in Wanzai, and the fake 4th Army and 12th Army are in Yifeng. Zhu De, Mao Zedong and the main force are all in Wanzai. It seems that their actions are intended to support the Peng bandits in Liuyang and disrupt in an unknown direction. However, Commander-in-Chief Lu presented successive requests to the National Government's General Headquarters for the allocation of aircraft to Jiangxi to assist in the suppression, because the actions of the communist bandits are erratic and their whereabouts are uncertain. Yesterday, the Aviation Administration sent a newly purchased Mos 103 fighter plane to Jiangxi. The pilots of the plane were Hu Yuhe and Tang Zuqing. When they arrived in Nanchang, they flew around the city for a week and then landed at the aircraft field of Daxiao Factory outside Shunhua Gate. The plane is a biplane, white in color, with machine guns and a guard team carrying a large number of bombs for bombing the enemy. This morning around 8:00 AM, the two pilots Hu and Tang, carrying a large number of colored leaflets from the Bandit Suppression Propaganda Office, flew to Gao'an, Shanggao, Yifeng, Wanzai, and the Pingjiang and Liuyang areas of Hunan Province to distribute them and scout out the bandit situation. After reconnaissance is completed, they will carry heavy bombs and fly to the bandit areas to bomb. It is expected that the Zhu-Mao bandit crowds will not be difficult to annihilate in one fell swoop. (August 14th)</p>
<h3>Organizational Content of the Wuchang Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Since the Wuchang Municipality was separated from the Hankou Municipality, it has been taken over and managed by the Provincial Government, and all facilities are determined by the Municipal Council. However, Wuchang is the area where the first uprising took place and is located in a strategic location. In fact, it is necessary to establish a municipal government. The Hubei Provincial Government's Political Affairs Conference has decided to implement the establishment and recommended Councilor Xiong Bingkun to concurrently serve as the mayor. After many days of preparation, it has taken shape and will be announced in the shortest time. Its organizational content fully follows the Municipal Organization Law promulgated by the National Government and takes into account the situation of the entire Wuchang city. The Finance Bureau and the Public Works Bureau will be established first, along with one Secretariat, two Social and Health Sections, and two independent organizations: the Accounting Office and the Treasury. In addition to the establishment of various sections in the Public Works Bureau and the Finance Bureau as usual, the Secretariat is divided into four units: Document, Compilation, Statistics, and General Affairs. The Social Affairs Section is divided into four units: Agriculture, Commerce, Industry Registration, Public Utility, and Education. The Health Section will not be established for the time being. The Accounting Office will be established as the Compilation and Review Unit, and the Treasury will be established as the Revenue and Expenditure Unit. The Finance Bureau and the Public Works Bureau will each have one Director. The Secretariat will have one Secretary and one Assistant Secretary. Each Section will have one Section Chief. The Accounting Office and the Municipal Treasury will each have one Director. The Municipal Council will be organized by the Mayor, Councilors, and Section Chiefs. The Secretary and the Director will also attend the meeting. Because the Public Security Bureau is directly under the Provincial Government and not under the Municipal Government, it is not within the scope of the Municipal Government, but it can be ordered to provide assistance if necessary. It is heard that the Mayor of the city is very cautious about the selection of the Directors of the above-mentioned bureaus, sections, chiefs, directors, councilors, and other personnel. Only a few people have been determined, and the rest are being sought. After the selection of personnel is completely determined, it will be submitted to the Provincial Government for appointment. However, before the Municipal Government is established, a total of four issues that need to be resolved first have been submitted by the Mayor of the city to the 50th Political Affairs Conference of the Provincial Government this month, and it has been decided to hand them over to the Secretariat for handling separately. The Wuchang Municipal Government can be announced within a few days. (August 13th)</p>
<h3>Two Proclamations Under Martial Law in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>The investigation and special affairs teams have determined and promulgated the method for registering civilian guns and cannons within a definite time limit. Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fuzhou Provisional Martial Law Headquarters issued a proclamation yesterday, saying that since the establishment of the headquarters, the investigation team originally organized by the 56th Division and the special affairs teams one and two have been transferred to the headquarters for dispatch, and the power has been unified. After separate receptions, the name of the investigation team was changed to the inspection team, and the special affairs teams one and two were reduced to one team. New badges were made and distributed to the personnel, who wore them during normal service and reported them to the provincial government. However, the investigation and special affairs teams are specifically set up to investigate bandits and reactionaries in order to maintain local security and protect the interests of the people. When bandits or reactionaries are discovered, they must first report for approval before the headquarters sends troops or the team members and police go to arrest them. If there is an urgent need to arrest them immediately because the report is too late, they should also secretly request the nearby military police to assist in the arrest and send them to the headquarters for interrogation. They must not use public office for private gain to frame good people, nor are they allowed to arbitrarily detain and release them, resulting in those who maintain the local area turning to disturb the local area, and those who protect our people turning to burden our people. If the commander and deputy commander lose their original intention of eradicating evil and protecting the people, in addition to ordering all team members to strictly abide by the rules and not to violate them in any way, this proclamation is hereby issued for general knowledge. If the headquarters' special affairs and inspection teams are found to be spreading rumors, extorting money, and arbitrarily detaining and releasing people outside, no matter who it is, they are allowed to be twisted and reported to the headquarters, and they will be punished according to military law without any leniency. All should abide by this proclamation.</p>
<p>The Provisional Martial Law Headquarters previously received an order from the Provincial Government to register guns and cannons for the people's own use in order to prevent abuses. Now, the headquarters has drafted a method for registering and issuing licenses for various guns and cannons for the people's own use and submitted it to the Provincial Government for approval and implementation. The following is a transcript: (Article 1) This method is in accordance with the instructions of the Fujian Provincial Government on July 30 and is based on the regulations on the inspection and licensing of self-defense guns and cannons promulgated and revised by the National Government on December 31, 18. (Article 2) All people, legal entities, and public agency personnel who own various guns and cannons within the Fuzhou city limits must follow this method and the temporary regulations on the inspection and licensing of self-defense guns and cannons. (Article 3) People, legal entities, public agency personnel, etc. who submit guns and cannons for inspection and registration may first obtain an application form and a guarantee form from the headquarters and fill them out according to the format and affix a seal, and then follow the procedures stipulated in Article 4 of this method. (Article 4) All people, legal entities, public agency personnel who own various guns and cannons, whether or not they have obtained a license, must submit the application form, the guarantee form, two half-length photos, and the license fee (legal entities do not need to submit a guarantee form or photos) along with the guns and cannons to the headquarters for inspection and verification before August 31. The guns and cannons will be taken back by the original applicant, and at the same time, the headquarters will issue a receipt for the license fee, etc., and then wait for the periodic branding and issuance of the certificate. (Article 5) The time for submitting guns and cannons for registration is set from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day, and will be handled separately by the General Staff Office of the headquarters. (Article 6) The self-defense gun and cannon certificate is set as three copies, one copy will be issued to the licensee, one copy will be kept by the headquarters, and one copy will be kept by the provincial government for record. (Article 7) The self-defense gun and cannon certificate is a temporary certificate. Once the citywide registration is completed, the headquarters will compile the case and submit it to the provincial government for transfer to the Ministry of Military Affairs for the issuance of a license, and then the headquarters will exchange the license for the licensee to keep and cancel the certificate at the same time. (Article 8) All Grade A guns and cannons submitted for inspection and registration will be compiled by the headquarters and submitted to the provincial government for valuation and recovery by the government, but they may not be resold, abandoned, or destroyed after registration. If such a situation occurs, they will be punished according to military law. Grade B and C guns and cannons will be licensed in accordance with the regulations for self-defense. (Article 9) After the registration period expires, if it is reported that a certain place or a certain house has privately stored military supplies and is suspected of communicating with bandits, and the headquarters verifies that the facts are true, they may go to inspect with the military police at any time and place. (Article 10) When conducting a random inspection of a certain street or a certain lane, the traffic in the street or lane and the entry and exit of the front and back doors of the people's residences will be immediately cut off, and the military police will be divided into groups to conduct a strict search. Those who resist will be arrested and punished according to law. (Article 11) The time and date for conducting a random inspection of a certain street or a certain lane may be determined at will by the headquarters in consultation with the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau, but the people will not be informed in advance. (Article 12) No matter what kind of guns and cannons are not submitted for inspection after the deadline, or are secretly transported to other places, buried, hidden, resold to bandits during the registration period, once discovered or reported and verified, they will be punished according to military law. (Article 13) These regulations will be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Fujian Government Supervises the Collection of Salt Surtax</h3>
<p>And Negotiates Loans with the General Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The salt tax surtax is designated as a special fund for provincial education. The provincial government has also appointed Chen Peikun and He Gonggan as supervisors. However, the auditing institute stated that it was detrimental to its powers. The provincial government replied that the surtax is not a regular tax and must be implemented. It has also been reported to the Ministry of Finance. Recently, the Ministry of Finance sent a telegram stating that the salt tax revenue should give first priority to the expenses of various salt affairs agencies and second priority to the repayment of foreign debt. If the regular tax is insufficient, it should be drawn from the surtax. The provincial government seems to have misunderstood the meaning of the telegram and has replied with a clear explanation that this surtax belongs to the local surtax and was previously designated by the Executive Yuan as a special fund for education. In recent months, the auditing sub-office has not allocated any of this surtax, and education in the province is on the verge of bankruptcy. In order to respect the central government's clear order that education funds should not be misappropriated, the provincial government has implemented the supervision of the collection of this fund, but the supervision is only within the scope of the surtax and does not infringe on the regular tax and the authority of the sub-office. Please understand and maintain the education fund and forward the telegram to the sub-office for compliance.</p>
<p>The provincial government's downsizing of various agencies can be described as extremely drastic, but the tax revenue has been sharply reduced and military expenses have increased. The Finance Department still feels that it has exhausted all its resources. At this critical juncture, it has to seek ways to replenish funds. Yesterday, it sent a letter to the Fuzhou General Chamber of Commerce to borrow 500,000 yuan from the merchant guilds and sent personnel to negotiate. However, the sales in the commercial field rely entirely on the upper reaches. Since the outbreak of the war, river transportation has been cut off and is on the verge of collapse. Moreover, the damage has been great and the need for relief is urgent. Therefore, it also sent a letter to various merchant guilds to hold a meeting to discuss the matter. The original letter stated that the Finance Department had sent a letter stating that military and political expenses were as urgent as a burning house and requested a temporary loan of 500,000 yuan from various merchant guilds. The specific methods will be discussed in person by the Director of the Finance Department at your association, or personnel will be sent to negotiate in detail to achieve a thorough solution. It is hereby decided to hold a meeting at 2:00 PM on August 12 to discuss the loan and request the authorities to open up river transportation so that goods from upstream and downstream can be circulated as soon as possible. At that time, it is hoped that you will be able to attend the meeting without delay. It is not known what attitude the various merchant guilds will take.</p>

<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Morning: [T13]1[/T] Modern History, Chinese and Foreign, for the Past Century: 1. The French Revolution broke political inequality and established democracy. The Russian Revolution broke economic inequality and implemented communism. The Turkish Revolution broke international inequality and revised treaties. Are their goals the same as those of our National Revolution? Please explain separately. 2. Both Soviet Russia and Italy are countries with one-party rule. Although their party ideologies are contradictory, they are both reactions against democracy. Is the trend of the development of democracy in the past century, which has been repeatedly hindered by the Allied forces and the Holy Alliance in various European countries, affected by this reaction and stalled? 3. Since the Opium War, imperialist countries have used all means to bind us with treaties. What kind of ideology should our people uphold to wash away this unprecedented shame in diplomatic history? [T13]2[/T] Chinese Human Geography: 1. In European countries, since the separation of politics and religion, thought has been free. Today, freedom of belief is enshrined in the constitution and is still regarded as one of the basic rights of the people. Buddhism is prevalent in the southeast of our country, Lamaism is practiced in Mongolia and Tibet, Islam has flowed into the northwest, and various new and old sects of Christianity have invaded the interior from the coast. All of them are compatible and inclusive, and the people have extremely free beliefs. Why is the intellectual development of our people different from that of Europeans? Can you briefly explain the reason? 2. China is known as a country with a vast territory, abundant resources, and a large population. In reality, the territory is vast but barren, the resources are abundant but wasted, and the population is large but idle. What kind of policies should be adopted to make the land as useful as possible, the resources as useful as possible, and the people as talented as possible? 3. In ancient times, culture spread from the Yellow River basin to the south, and in modern times, it spread from the Pearl River basin to the north. The geography is the same, but the direction of cultural transmission is reversed. What is the reason?</p>
<p>Afternoon: Overview of Current Laws and Regulations: 1. How does the Central Government regulate the relationship between governments and party departments at the same level? Is this regulation applicable to provinces and counties other than these two levels? Please explain your reasons for whether it is or is not applicable. 2. Please list the procedures for appointing directors of various bureaus in the County Organization Law and the current practices in this province, and explain them. 3. A review of the municipal administrative system over the past four years and a criticism of Jiangsu's cancellation of the cities of Suzhou and Wuxi.</p>

<p>Meeting to Allocate Yuecheng Base: The Yuecheng in this county was previously approved by the Construction Department to recruit workers to dismantle it.

<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>The two counties, Fengxian and Shanghai, held a joint defense. County Magistrate Shen Qingchen recently considered that the border with Shanghai County is adjacent and the ports and rivers are intertwined. During this time of rampant bandits and busy military affairs, it is necessary to establish a joint defense. Therefore, he specially sent a letter to Shanghai County to solicit their consent in accordance with the Wudan and Wucheng joint defense methods. It is reported that the reply has been received and indicates approval. The two magistrates, Yan and Shen, will convene gentry from the two counties to hold a meeting to discuss the matter in the near future.</p>
<p>The former prison warden escorted to the Shanghai Court: The former prison warden of this county is currently involved in an escape case. The High Court ordered the county to guard him and hand him over to the High Procuratorate for investigation. It is now learned that the High Court has transferred this case to the Shanghai District Court for trial. Therefore, the prison warden has been escorted to Shanghai by the county government police for detention.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Private Salt Case Appealed: The Minsheng Match Factory outside the Liumen Nantongzi Road was found to be manufacturing private salt by the 6th Anti-Smuggling Brigade stationed in Suzhou, and more than 1,000 catties of private salt were seized. The factory owner, Zhang Xia, was taken to the District Court for trial and acquitted. Because the prosecutor was not satisfied, he filed an appeal. Yesterday (the 16th), the Chief of the First Criminal Division of the High Court, Lin Dawen, opened the trial and summoned the factory owner, Zhang Bin, and his wife, Zhang Xia, to appear in court. Zhang also hired lawyer Zhang Ding to appear in court for defense. The court ordered the conclusion and set the sentence to be pronounced on the 21st of this month.</p>
<p>Taihu Bandits Lingering and Not Dispersing: After the Taihu bandits were persuaded to disband by Gong, the director of the 3rd Water Public Security District, who supervised the team, the Henan gang bandits have indeed disbanded, but the Haizhou gang is still lingering in the Nanshe Temple and other places. Because the Taihu port is closed, they cannot escape. After Gong received the report, he specially ordered the blocking and prevention teams to go to persuade and arrest them.</p>
<p>The Reformatory is About to Be Built: After the Preparatory Committee for the Reformatory of Jiangsu Province was established, committee members Wei Bangzhen, Yao Guozhang, and others actively prepared the plan.

It is said that the amount of opium was about 500 taels, but the report to the General Bureau only stated that 40 packages of opium were seized. On the night of the 10th, Tang left a note with a seal in the bureau and abandoned his post with Lu Hanqing and Wang Zhangyuan. It is now known that Police Chief Wang received a report from Inspector Zhu Huayan of the bureau and immediately sent personnel to investigate thoroughly. He also submitted the case to the county for instructions.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>A dispute involving a soldier at the South Station: At 9:50 AM on the 6th of this month, a passenger train from Shanghai to Wuxi at the Jinghu Railway Wuxi Flag Station had a passenger without a ticket disembark. The passenger carried a straw bag, which a porter found to be filled with opium, totaling more than a dozen red cakes. He immediately took it to the station master's office. While they were examining it, seven or eight soldiers from the County Police Team stationed at nearby Shepu Temple rushed over and seized both the suspect and the opium. Afterwards, the Wuxi Railway Police Section sent a letter to the County Police Team to thoroughly investigate the truth. They received a reply stating that the matter had been submitted to the local court for investigation. However, Police Section Chief Ma felt that the Police Team's actions were procedurally inappropriate and their response was vague and almost farcical. He reported the details of the incident to the Police Chief and sent a letter to the County Government requesting the names of the suspects and the quantity of opium seized by the County Police Team that day, so that he could submit a report for verification.</p>
<p>Japanese Silkworm Eggs Transported to Wuxi Were Confiscated: Wuxi is the central hub of the Jinghu Railway, with numerous factories and flourishing commerce. The silk industry is also quite developed. Unscrupulous merchants manufacture inferior silkworm eggs and sell them widely, causing countless losses to silk farmers. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines, recognizing this problem, established a Sericulture Control Office in Wuxi to eliminate these malpractices. They dispatched personnel to inspect train stations, wharves, and other locations. Yesterday morning at 10:30 AM, a Japanese man named Kakuda Yoshimura arrived in Wuxi by train from Shanghai, carrying over 1,500 sheets of inferior autumn silkworm eggs (branded "Fuji Foreign Firm"). He was intercepted by inspectors from the Sericulture Control Office and taken to the office along with the evidence for questioning. The Japanese man claimed that the inferior eggs were purchased by Fu Ruide of Fulun Sock Factory at Ximen Chengjiao and Meicun in Nanqiao and that he had come to Wuxi to deliver the goods and collect payment. Simultaneously, another traveler named Peng was also found to be transporting over 500 sheets of inferior "Parrot Brand" eggs to Wuxi for sale and was also intercepted by the inspectors and taken to the office to await disposition.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>A Closure Spree Among Inns at the South Gate: There are over ten inns and hostels on Zhenjiang's South Gate Street. Recently, due to the constant harassment by Platoon Leader Pan Tao of the Military Police Inspection Team, who used inspections as a pretext for causing trouble every night, he detained the mother and son of the Zhonghua Inn owner and a tea server from the Zhenyang Inn at the Public Security Bureau's Third Sub-bureau yesterday. As a result, the inns became anxious and unanimously closed their businesses yesterday. The inns jointly submitted a petition to the military and police authorities, requesting that they be allowed to make a living. The Zhonghua and Zhenyang Inns, because Platoon Leader Pan had allegedly said that the three people detained at the Third Sub-bureau would be shot, specially prepared three thin coffins and carried them to the entrance of the Third Sub-bureau to await the corpses, causing a widespread uproar. After Director Shi of the Third Sub-bureau made great efforts to persuade them and released the detained three, the three coffins were finally carried back. The public has submitted a report to the Civil Affairs Department to await a resolution regarding the disposition of Platoon Leader Pan.</p>
<p>Order to Demolish All Spirit Walls: The Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee recently sent a letter to the Provincial Government ordering all government agencies to demolish all spirit walls in the provincial capital. The Provincial Government immediately instructed the Department of Construction to comply. It is reported that the Department of Construction has ordered the Engineering Office to follow suit and will demolish the spirit wall in front of its building first.</p>
<p>The Thirty-third Hospital Received More Wounded Soldiers: The rear area Third Thirty-third Hospital of the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force received another 500 wounded and sick soldiers yesterday.

<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The Education Budget Was Rejected by the Department: Although the education budget for this county's nineteenth year has been repeatedly cut back by the Education Bureau before being submitted to the department, the general teaching staff already feel extremely dissatisfied. After receiving the budget, the department believes that it exceeds the standard by too much. Even after Education Director Chen Jin went to the provincial capital to explain the reasons why it could not be reduced further, the department believes it cannot be approved. It is said that the original budget book was ordered to be forwarded to the bureau through the county government yesterday, still requiring a major reduction. Director Chen has no solution and his decision to resign has been strengthened as a result.</p>
<p>The Women's Relief Center Is About to Run Out of Food: The Women's Relief Center affiliated with this county's relief institute has been established for ten months. Because it has no fixed funding, it has been in a state of economic panic every day. Initially, there were few women in the center, and the difficulties felt were still small. But as the number of people has been increasing day by day, there is no solution to the economic situation and it is about to run out of food.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Rampant Bandits in the Third District: On the evening of the previous day, more than a dozen bandits, each holding guns, suddenly swarmed into the Zhou Xiexian village behind the Dragon King Temple in the ninth village of the fifth district of this county. The villagers were unable to resist and allowed the bandits to search and loot. It is said that the village suffered significant losses. Unexpectedly, the bandits, not satisfied with their gains, went to the Chen Lianzhen lumber store in the eighth village of the fifth district to search and loot, and then went to Lianzhen's house to search, tying up and beating Lianzhen's wife, forcing her to reveal where the money was hidden. The neighbors immediately beat gongs and burned straw piles to alert neighboring villages. The bandits were not afraid and opened fire to intimidate them, and captured Wang Hongduo's son, who was putting out the fire on the scene, and beat him severely. His mother stepped forward to rescue him, and the bandits snatched a pair of gold earrings and a gold hairpin from her head. When the bandits left, they fired several shots, wounding a farmer, Lü Xiaosan's son, in the leg. Finally, the bandits went to the Qi family's house to search and loot, taking the spoils away with Zhang Anran.</p>
<p>An Imposter Military Officer Arrested and Sent to the Province: The previous night, a young man wearing a uniform and leather shoes was whispering with a young woman in the city park when he was spotted by Zhu Xiaoyangzi's son. They started fighting, and Police Officer Wang from the Public Security Bureau took him to the bureau. Yesterday morning, Director Zhou held a preliminary hearing. The young man claimed to be Li Hongxiang, an adjutant of the Zhengzhou Garrison Command, and presented his passport and the Anhui Provincial Party Department Executive Committee badge to verify his identity. He said that he was returning home on official business. Director Zhou examined the passport and saw that it was written as "clerk," clearly indicating that he was impersonating a military officer. He immediately prepared a document to send him to the County Government for interrogation, and he was sent to the province for interrogation at eight o'clock this summer.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The Joint Defense of the Eight Counties of Tongtai: The Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and the Provincial Security Department ordered Li Changjiang, the third regiment commander of the Joint Defense Committee of the Eight Counties of Tongtai, to take charge of the command. In addition to carrying out the planned suppression, Li came to Tong from the province and simultaneously carried out a clean-up campaign. Five bandits were executed in Dongxiang. The anti-bandit military police arrested five bandits in Dongxiang: Zhang Guodong, Zi Junfeng, Ji Jinrong, Mao Tao San, and Tang Jinxiang. They were taken to the anti-bandit command for interrogation and confessed to robbery and murder of police officers. They were escorted to Sijiaba to be executed by firing squad.</p>
<p>Reorganization of the District Defense Corps: Previously, due to the rampant banditry in various districts of Nantong, the method of conscripting people into the defense corps was difficult to implement. Therefore, temporary soldiers were recruited locally. Now, the County Government, upon the order of the Provincial Government, notified all districts that those in bandit-affected and neighboring areas could temporarily use the recruitment system, while non-bandit areas should all be reorganized into formal defense corps.</p>
<p>Joint Suppression of Sea Bandits by the Army and Navy: The bandit gang led by Shen Guanxi and Chen Asan in the waters of the four counties of Tong, Ru, Hai, and Qi has gathered a thousand people. In addition to robbing merchant ships and demanding ransoms, they also collect flag fees from fishermen. The military and police of the four counties have joined forces with naval gunboats to suppress them at Sanjia Town's Da'an Port.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>A Young Child Was Kidnapped by Bandits: The family of Lu Huasheng, a farmer in Dong Shen village in the Nanhengzhao area of Xinmiao Town, is relatively well-off. A few days ago, they received a letter from bandits demanding 2,200 yuan, with the deadline for delivery at Luwan Temple. Lu thought the amount was too large and did not ask anyone to negotiate. Several days after the deadline, there was no movement. On the afternoon of the 12th, suddenly five or six armed bandits rushed into Lu's house and kidnapped Huasheng's grandson, a young child of only four years old. The matter has not been resolved yet.</p>
<p>Brown Planthopper Eggs Found in Old Xiwufang: The Old Xiwufang Public Security Bureau Substation purchased 8,000 brown planthopper egg masses on the morning of the 12th. In the afternoon, they continued to receive a total of 58,400 egg masses. The two days before and after that also saw incoming reports. The most common breeding grounds were in Qingyun, Zhao Jing, and Zhu Port villages bordering Haiyan.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Xu Jinong of Hexi Was Kidnapped: Xu Jinong's family in Daxianli, Hexi Town, in the west of Changxing, is quite wealthy and has long been coveted by bandits. Because his house is sturdy, they could not break in for a while. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the previous day, Xu was returning home from the coal mine bureau when he suddenly encountered four bandits holding pistols and speaking with a Kejia accent. They stopped him, tied him up, and took him away. Afterwards, the bandits sent a letter to Xu's family demanding 60,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Special Curfew in the City: The military authorities in this city suddenly announced a special curfew last night. From 10:00 PM, all shops and public places were closed. Pedestrians were not allowed to travel without a password. All military police were armed with live ammunition and deployed on key roads. It is said that the reason for the curfew was that the communists were planning a nationwide demonstration on August 15th. Therefore, the central government ordered all provinces to instruct their military authorities to conduct strict investigations.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>A Large Number of Sick and Wounded Continue to Arrive in Jiashan: Since this county organized the Thirty-fourth Rear Hospital, over 190 wounded soldiers arrived on the afternoon of the 14th. On the morning of the 15th, over 900 wounded soldiers were sent from the front, resulting in insufficient barracks and beds that had been prepared. It is said that there are still wounded soldiers coming to Jiashan one after another, but the number is unknown. Therefore, County Magistrate Liang specially ordered the staff of the Thirty-fourth Rear Hospital Liaison Office to quickly find suitable houses for them to stay in.</p>
<p>The Sunken Ship at Desheng Port Has Been Salvaged: The Xikuang Jiaxing Company and Shi Wansheng Company hired Li Qiutao's boat to transport fifty bags of Lion and Horse brand fertilizer powder and fifteen tons of coal dust. The boat sank at Desheng Port, as reported in this newspaper. Now, the sunken ship has been salvaged. The remaining cargo was loaded onto another Shen ship and taken to Xikuang. The fertilizer powder was washed away by the water, leaving only twenty-three empty bags. About nine tons of coal dust remain. The total loss is over a thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Establishment of the County National Arts Hall: The Jiaxing County National Arts Hall has been in preparation for a long time and was officially established on the 16th.

<p>Latest News on the Case of Plotting to Kill Platoon Leader Li: Li Jinsheng, the platoon leader of the Second Battalion of the former Jiaxing garrison, was plotted to be killed when he came to He on official business last month. The case was exposed and the people involved in the case, Xu Kun, Wu Zhuqing, and Cao Xiuying, were successively apprehended in He and sent to the Songhu Garrison Command for interrogation, and then transferred to the Military Law Office of the Army, Navy, and Air Force General Headquarters for trial. The case has now been clearly investigated by the Military Law Office. Cao Xiuying has been granted bail by the court. A Large Number of Refugees Arrived in Caozhuang Town: Since Caozhuang Town in Jiaxing County was looted by bandits at the end of last month, the aftermath has not yet been handled properly, and the business of the stores has not returned to its original state. Unexpectedly, a large number of four or five hundred refugees arrived in the town yesterday. The people in the town feared that it would cause an incident, and someone reported it to the Yuxian Branch Bureau, which went to the town to suppress it. Later, the County Public Security Bureau of this city also received a report and sent a patrol team to assist in suppressing and expelling them.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Ningbo City Imposes Martial Law: The Ningbo City Public Security Bureau, in order to strengthen its defenses, issued a notice to all its teams and stations that a special state of martial law was declared starting last night (the 14th). Anyone with suspicious behavior should be carefully questioned and detained in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Questions Arise Regarding the Reorganization of the Chamber of Commerce: After the Zhejiang Provincial Chamber of Commerce Consolidation Committee sent personnel to Ningbo and the Yin County Party Department recommended nine people, including Lin Qinxiang and Yuan Duanfu, to be members of the Ningbo Municipal Chamber of Commerce Consolidation Committee, the Chamber of Commerce had already received an order to execute the takeover. But yesterday, it received an order from the Municipal Government stating that it should be reorganized according to the current Chamber of Commerce Law before August 15 to comply with the regulations. The Chamber of Commerce was at a loss after receiving the order and is preparing to request an explanation.</p>
<p>Appointment of the Director of the Municipal Bureau of Finance: It has been many days since the Director of the Ningbo Municipal Bureau of Finance, Zhang Xilin, resigned. The position of Finance Director has been vacant until yesterday, when Zhang Sichuan was recommended by gentlemen and merchants Lin Qinxiang and Yu Zuoting to succeed him. Mayor Yang has agreed and officially appointed him. Mr. Zhang is a native of this county, only twenty-six years old, and graduated from the Department of Economics of Guanghua University in Shanghai. He is currently the Director of the Finance Bureau of Jurong County, Jiangsu. His father is Zhang Pofu, the current Deputy Director of the Siming Bank in this city. It is said that the date of his arrival is around the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Salt Merchants Go to Shanghai to Discuss Loans: The salt merchants of Eastern Zhejiang previously sent representatives Yu Xiangzhou, Bao Meibo, and Song Yixuan to the province to jointly discuss with Hangzhou and Anhui merchants at a meeting of the Transportation Office about borrowing 400,000 yuan from Liben Hall. The Department Director ordered all salt merchants to follow the previous precedent and allocate the required funds in cash. The representatives were unable to comply because they had no funds and intended to borrow from banks, but the banks also had no funds to lend and could not resolve the issue. Now, because the Ministry has been urgently urging them to pay quickly, it is difficult to delay. The merchants have appointed representatives Bao Xianggu, Bao Yuchen, and Bao Xuanchen to go to Hangzhou on the 15th to work with the representatives in the province to jointly discuss the progress. They intend to further elect representatives to go to Shanghai for a meeting.</p>
<p>Gamblers Plot to Lure the Police into an Ambush and Beat Them: The Fifth Station of the Second Public Security Bureau, stationed at the Wuyun Gate, suddenly received a report in the middle of the night on the 14th that someone was gambling behind the Shaocao bus station. The station dispatched over ten police officers to make an arrest. Unexpectedly, when they reached the T-junction of the bus road, dozens of people with weapons suddenly emerged and surrounded and beat the police officers. No one was spared until all the police officers fell to the ground, and then they went west in a line. The Public Security Bureau dispatched teams overnight to investigate, but found no trace of them. All the police officers were injured. The most seriously injured was Liu Sencheng, who may be in danger of his life. The next most seriously injured were Zhang Guoying and Zhang Mao, who were carried to the hospital by workers for treatment. Director Gao of the Public Security Bureau then sent personnel to investigate and found that the food vendors in front of the bus station were related to the case. The vendors, Jin Ajiang and another person, were detained and interrogated. They confessed that the incident occurred because the Public Security Bureau had arrested and fined people for gambling in Wuyunmen the previous night. The fined people were workers from a certain place, so they gathered a large number of workers to plan a fake report of gambling to lure the police into an ambush to retaliate. The bureau has transferred the two vendors and the injured police officers to the court for examination and investigation.</p>
<p>Handling Losses from Suspended Grain Price Control: Since the decision to suspend grain price control in Shaoxing, there has been much criticism from all sides. Now, the Supervisory Committee held its ninth meeting on the afternoon of the 14th. Upon temporary proposal, the previous purchase of expensive grain by the County Grain Maintenance Committee has resulted in a significant loss of public funds, and the subsequent decision to suspend grain price control has further undermined the faith of the poor. The committee believes that the improper actions of the Grain Maintenance Committee should be seriously corrected, and the responsible personnel of the committee should be responsible for selling off the purchased grain and the losses should be compensated by the responsible personnel of the committee in order to protect public funds. It was resolved to hand this over to the Executive Committee for handling. In addition, the joint association of various villages in the city area has sent a letter to the Party and government agencies requesting that grain be released quickly to provide relief to the poor. The County Executive Committee also resolved yesterday that the previously purchased controlled grain should be sold by the members of the Grain Maintenance Committee, and the loss of public funds should be made up by the committee. On the other hand, new grain should be purchased to quickly carry out grain price control. A letter has been sent to the county government yesterday for handling.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Drafted Police Donation Rates for Provincial Approval: The Xiaoshan County Government believes that the existing and newly added police donations are insufficient to cover expenses. It is now proposing five levels of donation rates: Special Grade, donating four to ten yuan per month; First Grade, three yuan; Second Grade, two yuan; Third Grade, one yuan; Fourth Grade, five jiao, and ordering tea shops, taverns, and restaurants to bear the burden. It has submitted a request to the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments for approval.</p>
<p>The Accidental Shooting Case Has Been Pronounced: Chen Xijiu, an investigator in the Public Security Bureau of Xiaoshan County, was previously investigated by the County Court for accidentally shooting and killing guard Guo Yongxiang. Yesterday (the 12th), Judge Luo re-examined the case in the public trial court and confirmed that it was indeed an accident. Judge Luo asked Prosecutor Feng to appear in court and sentenced Chen Xijiu to a fine of 200 yuan for negligent homicide. If he is unable to pay, his failure to pay will be offset by one day of detention for every two yuan of the fine.</p>

<h3>Tax Revenue Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Finance Minister Song continued to meet with representatives from various provincial salt tax bureaus, official property bureaus, and wheat flour tax bureaus, as well as various special commissioners who had reported their arrival, at the Central Bank's third-floor office. These included Shen Shizhong, Chief of the Tax Section of the Suzhou Customs Superintendent's Office, Wu Shi, Director of the Hubei Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau, and Bi Yunchou, Director of the Anhui Stamp Tax Bureau, totaling dozens of people. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM. It was originally scheduled to continue in the afternoon, but because all the provincial representatives had finished meeting, the discussion did not continue in the afternoon. The conference has concluded. According to Secretary Chen of the Ministry of Finance, Minister Song convened the representatives of various provinces purely to solicit their opinions on local tax regulations to prepare for the future promulgation of various new tax regulations, what should be promoted and what should be abolished. When meeting with the provincial representatives, he mostly consulted a few words. It was not a conference to discuss national tax regulations. Now that it has ended, the minister will take the opinions of the provinces and representatives back to the Ministry of Finance for careful review. The minister is expected to return to Beijing tomorrow. The results of this convocation of personnel from various provinces and the timing of implementation are not matters that can be completed in a short period.</p>
<h3>Chen Xizeng Succeeds as General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>Chen Expresses Intention to Thoroughly Reform, Cai Peisays Handover Has Been Made.</p>
<p>The State Council meeting on the 15th approved the appointment of Chen Xizeng as the General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The official order was issued yesterday. Mr. Chen, the current Director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, told reporters that he had only learned about it through the newspaper and had not yet received the official order, so he had nothing to say. All matters of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company followed established methods and lacked reforms. All aspects of personnel administration were extremely uneconomical, and the financial crisis was the primary problem for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company today. Therefore, the first thing to do in the future is to thoroughly reform the organization and inject new life, then expand. Mr. Chen also said that Mr. Zhao was his old friend of ten years and had devoted himself to the reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. It is a pity that there have been dishonest criticisms of him after his death. The reporter of this newspaper met with Cai Pei yesterday. According to him, he had been temporarily maintaining the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for the past ten days. He was exhausted, but fortunately, someone had taken over and he could return to his initial position. He was overjoyed.</p>
<h3>Wang Jiazhen Is Not Coming to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mayor Zhang Remains in Shenyang Temporarily</p>
<p>Wang Jiazhen, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, went to Liaoning to participate in the second anniversary of Zhang Zuolin's death and to report everything to Zhang Xueliang. He has now completed his public duties and took the Dayunfan from Dalian on the 15th to return to Shanghai. He is expected to arrive at Huishan Wharf at 3:00 PM today. The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a telegram from the ministry informing it to send someone to the wharf to take care of him. Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun is temporarily staying in Liaoning due to important public duties to negotiate with Zhang Xueliang and will not return south for the time being. A Qingdao telegram from the Japan News Agency on the 16th said that Wang Jiazhen, who was going to Nanjing to resume his duties, arrived here this morning on the Dalianfan but suddenly changed his plans and will stay here temporarily.</p>
<h3>Jin Liyuan Wharf Case</h3>
<p>Hopes for a Peaceful Resolution Within Days, Cai Pei to Meet with the French Consul Tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Jin Liyuan Wharf incident of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been resolved through diplomatic means. Yesterday morning, Cai Pei, the acting General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office to contact Liu Yunfang about everything. Liu forwarded it to the French Consul. According to the French Consul, he has notified the French Catholic Church of the Three Virtues Church to not insist on their views and seek a peaceful resolution as soon as possible. He has also scheduled a meeting with Cai Pei tomorrow (the 18th) at 4:00 PM to resolve the dispute in person. Therefore, it is expected that this matter will not become a problem. Yesterday, the reporter of this newspaper interviewed Mr. Cai. According to him, the Jin Liyuan Wharf is the lifeline of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. This time, the Three Virtues Church took advantage of the situation to terminate the lease agreement, and the French Public Concession Court made a biased judgment. Now, diplomatic means have been adopted to seek a just resolution. The French Consul has repeatedly told the diplomatic authorities that he has ordered the Three Virtues Church to seek a peaceful resolution as soon as possible, and the French Public Concession Court has been prevented from executing the judgment. Ma Xiangbo, Lu Bohong, and others have been mediating. The French Consul has scheduled a meeting with him on Monday, so the continuation or renewal of the lease agreement is no longer a problem. If the land price increases and the rent is slightly increased, it is also reasonable, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will be happy to discuss it at length.</p>

<h3>Postal Workers' Representatives Go to Beijing Today</h3>
<p>Regarding the Cancellation of the Separate Savings and Remittance Bureau.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Employees' Union previously proposed ten outstanding issues, which have been satisfactorily resolved.

<h3>Additional Agencies for Issuing Passports for Going Abroad</h3>
<p>Official Letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation of the Republic of China believes that there are many people going abroad for business from Shantou, but there is no agency there to issue passports. It sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting that the Shantou Municipal Government be designated as the agency for issuing passports for going abroad. Yesterday, the federation received an official letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating: "Regarding the request to continue to allow the Shantou Municipal Government to be the agency for issuing passports for going abroad, our ministry has issued a letter on July 14th to the Shantou, Yantai, Yili, Aershan, Tacheng, and other city and county governments to add agencies for issuing passports for going abroad and has filed it with the Executive Yuan for record. We hereby inform you for your information."</p>
<h3>American Court in Shanghai Hears Case of Chinese Merchants Suing for Passport Denial</h3>
<p>The "Da Mei Evening News" reports that in April of last year, two merchants from Guangdong sought to travel to the United States and twice applied to the American Consul General in Guangzhou, Mr. Hinkes, for passport visas and the sixth-section certificate. Both applications were rejected. Subsequently, they filed a lawsuit with the American Court in Shanghai against the Consul General, accusing him of violating laws and the Sino-American treaty by acting arbitrarily. They requested a writ of mandamus to compel the proper execution of his duties. The hearing took place yesterday (the 15th) in Shanghai. The American prosecutor, Mr. Saleird, argued that the case was not under the jurisdiction of the court and that the defendant had given fair consideration to the plaintiffs' requests and could not be accused of acting arbitrarily. The American judge stated that the case was a diplomatic matter and not under the court's jurisdiction. Even if the defendant had acted arbitrarily, the plaintiffs' remedy was to negotiate with the U.S. State Department through diplomatic channels. Furthermore, the defendant had determined that the plaintiffs were not traveling to the United States for business purposes but intended to reside there for other reasons; therefore, the visa was denied. According to the laws cited by the plaintiffs, they must first obtain proof of identity and permission to travel to the U.S. from their own government, which was not mentioned in their petition.</p>
<h3>Preparing to Host Canadian Trade Delegation</h3>
<p>A Canadian trade delegation will arrive in Shanghai in November. Shanghai organizations believe that the visit will be of great importance for international relations and plan to host a welcome.

More than ten people attended, including Dong Keren from the Social Affairs Bureau and Zheng Chengqing from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The meeting decided to invite related organizations to participate and set the next preparatory meeting for Wednesday next week.</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants Expand Shipping on the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>British ships have historically dominated the Yangtze River shipping industry. Despite the national government's advocacy for reclaiming inland waterway rights, foreign merchants continue to actively expand and compete, without any slackening. Recently, British shipping companies have spared no effort in building ships and competing for transport along the Yangtze River. This matter is of great importance to the rise and fall of China's shipping rights and is detailed below:</p>
<p>British Companies Increase Ships</p>
<p>Recently, the shipping industry has focused on express ships. On the Yangtze River, Butterfield &amp; Swire (太古) and Jardine Matheson (怡和) have taken the lead in building powerful, high-speed vessels, while older coal-fired river steamers will gradually be phased out. Butterfield &amp; Swire's newly built Wuhu and Wuxue ships use diesel engines and can travel at 18 li per hour. The Wuxue ship is also about to be launched, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River routes will be merged into one line. Seven ships, including the Chongqing, Anqing, Huangpu, Wenzhou, Wuchang, Shengjing, and Wusong, have been assigned to the downstream routes of Shanghai and Hankou. The Wuhu, Wuxue, Datong, and Poyang ships have been assigned to the Shanghai-Yichang route in the middle reaches. The Changsha, Ji'an, Shashi, and Xiangtan ships have been assigned to the Hankou-Yichang route, totaling fifteen ships. The round trip of the newly built ships will be two to three days faster. Eight ships have been assigned to the Sichuan river in the upper reaches. Since Jardine Matheson's new Jianglun Baohua was completed, a total of six ships have been assigned to the lower reaches, ten ships to the middle reaches, and three ships to the upper reaches. From next month, Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson will have a total of forty-two ships operating on the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Cutting Prices to Compete</p>
<p>Butterfield &amp; Swire's Yangtze River business has seen a decline in import and export goods this spring. To reverse the situation, the company began to drastically cut freight rates for upstream and downstream goods two weeks ago. Customers took advantage of the lower prices, and cargo volume increased sharply. The company also secretly cut freight rates for Shanghai's export goods to various Yangtze River ports. In the past week, the company's export cargo has increased significantly. Before the price cuts, each ship carried at most three to four thousand pieces of cargo. Now, the number has increased to more than double, even exceeding ten thousand pieces. The company has also taken over the transportation of rice, which was originally carried by Chinese river steamers. This is because the Chinese vessels have stopped operating. The company's river steamer business has improved significantly.</p>
<p>Adding Lighters</p>
<p>In addition to wharves, lighters are the most important facilities in various Yangtze River ports. This year, Butterfield &amp; Swire has spent more than 100,000 yuan to replace several large-capacity new lighters in Zhenjiang, Hankou, and other ports. These lighters have already been put into use for storing upstream and downstream goods. It has also been reported that after the company's new Wuxue ship is completed, the existing Shengjing ship will be converted into a lighter. Recently, due to martial law in Hankou, there have been fewer goods arriving. However, British warships protect the ships along the way.</p>
<p>Sui Ding Resumes Service</p>
<p>Butterfield &amp; Swire's Sui Ding ship previously extorted exorbitant ticket prices from passengers when the Communist Party entered Hunan. In fourteen hours, the comprador, Mr. Yang, collected more than 30,000 yuan. After a complaint from the Hankou fellow villagers association, it was confirmed yesterday that Mr. Yang had commissioned someone to smooth things over and returned the gold jewelry and other items that had been used as collateral for the extorted ticket prices. He also expressed remorse. The ship has now resumed service on the Hunan-Hubei line.</p>
<h3>Rice Stem Borer Eggs Found Again in Wusong Fields</h3>
<p>Government Authorities Responsible for Purchasing</p>
<p>A large number of rice pests, known as black stink bugs, were recently discovered in the fields around Wusong. They were scattered by the hurricane. A small number of surviving insects hid deep in the rice roots. Farmers released ducks into the fields to freely prey on them, and the pests have gradually been eliminated. The farmers were delighted, saying that this year would surely bring a bumper harvest. However, before one wave subsided, another arose. In the fields between Wusong and Yinhang, countless rice stem borer eggs have suddenly been discovered in recent days. The rice leaves are almost entirely covered and scorched black. The larvae will hatch into moths and cause even greater damage. Reporters learned that the areas with the most rice stem borer eggs are in plots 25, 32, and 22 of Gang. The local Baojia have reported the situation to the Wusong Municipal Committee. Two members of the committee, Tang and Liu, immediately sent people to investigate and set up a purchasing station. On the first day, they collected more than 60,000 rice stem borer eggs, paying a total of more than 400,000 copper coins. Purchasing continued yesterday. The funds are temporarily advanced by the municipal committee members, who have reported to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and requested an allocation.</p>
<h3>Fundraising Method for Dredging the Wusong River</h3>
<p>Designated Funds for Issuing Public Bonds</p>
<p>The Construction Bank believes that dredging the Wusong River is a matter of urgency, but fundraising is difficult. The preparatory committee previously asked the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to draft fundraising methods. The bank has now received a letter from the chamber outlining the fundraising methods as follows:</p>
<p>When the Wusong River was dredged in the 13th year of the Republic of China (1924), the fundraising methods were divided into two parts: 1. The eight counties collected a surcharge on land taxes. 2. Merchants and organizations donated voluntarily. The first was a mandatory levy, while the second was a voluntary contribution, with no mandatory power. The eight counties each made their own decisions based on the resolutions of their respective county councils. The decision-makers to levy taxes were also the custodians of the funds, which easily led to misappropriation. Furthermore, there was no supervisory body to ensure compliance. As a result, fundraising did not meet expectations, and the project was interrupted. These were all past failures. The proposed fundraising method should learn from past mistakes and improve them. It should also refer to past fundraising methods and expand them. Once the premise has been determined, the methods are described below:</p>
<p>1. The merchant donation method should be changed to a surcharge on goods. This method follows the precedent of the Junpu surcharge and the Jiangbei Canal project surcharge and is not an innovation. All ships carrying merchant goods traveling on the Wusong River will have the surcharge collected by the customs or tax office when customs duties and commodity taxes are paid. The tax rate per item and the duration of the surcharge should be considered after the construction cost estimate and budget have been prepared.</p>
<p>2. The unpaid portion of the levies from the counties that have not fully paid should be investigated. Those who have embezzled funds should be held accountable and ordered to compensate the funds in installments. Those who have not collected the full amount should continue to collect according to the previous plan. In addition, if counties such as Taicang have not yet implemented the surcharge and the current land tax already exceeds the limits set by the Ministry of Finance, they should allocate a certain amount from their respective construction funds each year to supplement the original quota of 300,000 yuan for the eight counties.</p>
<p>3. This dredging project is being undertaken jointly by the province and the city. The municipal government should also allocate public funds to support it. The Shanghai Municipal Wharf Dues are approximately 600,000 to 700,000 taels of silver, which has always been monopolized by the Public Works Department, with the Chinese side receiving only one-tenth of it. This distribution issue has long been a point of contention. There is now a proposal to allocate the wharf dues collected in Pudong and Nanshi entirely to the Chinese side. If this is achieved, the municipal government's revenue will naturally increase compared to before. It is proposed to allocate a portion of these funds to the Wusong River dredging project. The specific amount to be allocated each year should be discussed at the next meeting or by a public body in the future.</p>
<p>4. The Department of Construction has repeatedly proposed levying funds for river management. It is uncertain whether this proposal has been suspended. If this proposal can be implemented, the Wusong River is also one of the rivers in Jiangsu Province. It is proposed to allocate a portion of the river management funds to this project.</p>
<p>5. The above four fundraising methods involve annual collections, which may not be sufficient to meet the needs of the construction. It is proposed that after the construction estimate is finalized, a budget should be prepared first, paying attention to two aspects: (a) The revenue side should determine the actual amount of funds that can be collected from the four items each year. (b) The expenditure side should be divided into the Wusong River dredging cost and the repayment of the 120,000 yuan previously borrowed for the eastern section project. After the budget is prepared, a type of Wusong River public bond should be issued based on the estimated tax amount. The four sources of funds should be allocated as a public bond fund, and a fundraising committee should be organized to conduct fundraising. The bond funds should be used to clear the previous advance in one lump sum to avoid the government paying more interest. The remaining funds should be deposited in a bank designated by the management committee and withdrawn according to procedures when public funds are needed. The revenue from the four surcharges should also be transferred to the management committee at any time. The management committee can audit all receipts and expenditures at any time to prevent misappropriation.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Requests Instructions on the Freedom to Organize Trade Associations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday presented a document to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting instructions regarding the discrepancy between the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's interpretation of the law on organizing trade associations and the principles of the Chamber of Commerce Law passed by the Central Political Council. The document stated:</p>
<p>It is hereby submitted that the issue of whether stores can freely organize trade associations should be clarified. The principles determined by the Central Political Council and the opinions interpreted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce are divergent. Please forward this document for verification and instructions to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>In the past, the Commercial Rectification Committee submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce requesting instructions on whether banks could join the Chamber of Commerce independently. On June 18, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued a reply No. 10894 stating, "I have received your telegram No. 30. After investigation, the phrase 'although there is the same industry, there is no organization of a trade association' in Article 6 of the Chamber of Commerce Law refers to cases where there are fewer than seven businesses in the same industry in the same area. If there are more than seven banks in the city, they should still organize a trade association in accordance with the Law on Trade Associations of Industry and Commerce, and the association should send representatives to join the Chamber of Commerce. The provisions for store members cannot be applied to join the Chamber of Commerce independently in order to comply with the legal system and avoid disputes." The Ministry's approval indicates that if there are more than seven stores in the same city, they should organize a trade association in accordance with the Law on Trade Associations of Industry and Commerce. Otherwise, they should not be allowed to join the Chamber of Commerce independently. This means that organizing an association has a mandatory nature and is not a matter of free will for stores. This is undoubtedly clear. However, Article 1 of the Law on Trade Associations states that "all those engaged in legitimate industry or commerce in the same area may establish a trade association in accordance with this law." According to the style of writing used in the law, the word "may" in the article indicates an optional provision rather than a mandatory provision. This type of wording is too numerous to list. Since the law states that a trade association "may be established in accordance with this law," whether or not to establish a trade association is purely a matter of free will for industrial and commercial businesses. Article 3 states that the initiation by "seven or more businesses" is a condition for obtaining establishment permission. Its nature is the same as the requirement that a limited liability company be limited to a certain number of initiators. The only reason is that if the legal number is not met, the conditions for organization are not met. It does not seem that it can be interpreted as an obligation to organize once the organizational conditions are met. The so-called freedom of assembly and association for the people in legal theory inherently contains two meanings: one is that if the establishment of an organization by the people meets the statutory conditions, the government cannot arbitrarily obstruct its establishment; the other is that if the people believe that there is no need to establish an organization, even if the statutory conditions are met, the law does not force its establishment. It is also noted that at the 183rd meeting of the Central Political Council on June 9 of the previous year, the review opinions on the interpretation of the organizational units of the Chamber of Commerce in the principles of the Chamber of Commerce Law, as reported by Wang Chonghui and Hu Hanmin, were resolved to be passed in accordance with the review report. Item 3 of the report stated that "commercial legal entities are not required to organize trade associations if they meet the conditions of the principles," and the reasons are attached, stating that "whether commercial legal entities that meet the conditions of the principles wish to organize trade associations is entirely a matter of free will and cannot be forced." Therefore, the original intention of Article 6 of the Chamber of Commerce Law at the time of its formulation did not contain the meaning that stores must be forced to organize associations if they reach more than seven businesses. The Chamber of Commerce Law was formulated based on principles, and the meaning contained in its wording cannot violate the principles and be established. As far as the industrial and commercial situation in this city is concerned, stores that have more than seven businesses but cannot organize associations all have their own compelling reasons. Therefore, limiting them from joining the Chamber of Commerce independently as a punishment for not organizing an association does not seem fair in light of the facts. However, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is the highest administrative organ, and its interpretation of the law is divergent from the claims of the Central Political Council. The department feels difficult to handle in practice. For the sake of clarity, this document is submitted to your office for review and instructions to ensure compliance. This is for public use.</p>
<h3>International Labor Office Letter to Seamen's Union</h3>
<p>Restoring the Hong Kong Branch and Issuing Strike Compensation</p>
<p>Zhao Zhizhi, Director of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial Union, received a reply from Mr. Thomas, Director of the International Labor Office, stating that he had received and was very grateful for the documents sent by your office on February 18 and January 8 regarding the restoration of the Hong Kong branch and the implementation of the agreement to resolve the 1922 strike. However, he was sorry that he could not reply immediately. Mr. Chen, who is in charge of Chinese affairs, has returned home to organize the Chinese branch of the International Labor Office. He was very pleased to read the description of the situation regarding the restoration of the Hong Kong branch and the resolution of the 1922 strike. He will do his best to promote the resolution of various specific difficulties. However, at the present time, he did not think it would be useful to interfere directly from Geneva. As you know, my interference must take a personal form, and as Director of the International Labor Office, I have no right to implement this matter. Unfortunately, Sir Kimwong, with whom I corresponded privately last year, has retired as Governor of Hong Kong, and I have not met his successor. Therefore, I can only suggest that the consultations between the Chinese government representatives and the British side, as indicated in your letter of November 1 last year, should continue. I feel that this is the best method and I am confident that this direct consultation will eventually reach an agreement that will satisfy all parties. July 29, 1930</p>

<h3>Long-Distance Telephone Charges Between Chinese and Foreign Lines</h3>
<p>Over 10,000 Yuan in Accumulated Arrears, Telephone Bureau Negotiates Recovery</p>
<p>The China Eastern News Agency reports that an important official of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications told reporters yesterday that since May of the 15th year of the Republic of China (1926), the bureau and the China and Foreign Telephone Company have had a contract for telephone calls. Users in the concession must pay an additional handling fee of five cents for each call to the inland bureau, and 15 cents for express calls. In addition to the handling fee, long-distance calls are charged at the inland bureau's standard rate, with express calls costing three times the standard rate. The China and Foreign Telephone Company deducts the handling fee from the monthly payment and remits the balance to the Telephone Bureau. However, over the years, the China and Foreign Telephone Company has often omitted the express call fees. Since Director Zhao took office, he immediately discovered that the China and Foreign Telephone Company's payments had omitted unremitted express call fees over the years, totaling a loss of about 10,000 yuan. He immediately sent someone to negotiate. Although the China and Foreign Telephone Company acknowledged the need to make up the payment, it has not yet made a definite statement. It is rumored that the China and Foreign Telephone Company's arrears are actually a mistake regarding long-distance telephone charges.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Steamer Stewards Extort Liquor Fees</h3>
<p>Three Companies Unable to Rectify</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Shipping Association received instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate the extortion of liquor fees from passengers by stewards on Shanghai-Ningbo steamers, it convened a meeting of key officials from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, San Bei Steamship Company, Ning Shao Steamship Company and other three companies the day before yesterday (the 14th). After discussions involving Qia Qing, Hu Yongqi, Feng Biren, and others, it was agreed that the companies themselves had no ability to rectify the situation. The Shipping Association decided to prepare a document and submit it to the Social Affairs Bureau for review and handling.</p>
<h3>Organizational Procedures for Anti-Drug Propaganda Associations</h3>
<p>Distinction Between Original Branches and Fellow Societies of Anti-Drug Groups in Various Places</p>
<p>The former is a systematic organization of the China National Anti-Drug Association, while the latter is a friendship organization led by the association. In recent years, more than 400 fellow societies have been established in various places. Previously, in order to centralize the affairs of anti-drug groups in various places and increase the number of organizational locations, the association changed all fellow societies to anti-drug propaganda associations to be solely responsible for anti-drug propaganda. At the same time, former branches were also reorganized into local anti-drug associations. Organizational locations are limited to provinces, cities, and overseas locations, while propaganda associations have no limited area. The organizational procedures are now announced as follows:</p>

<h3>Medical Care Provided in the Fourth District of Shanghai County</h3>
<p>Bi Huanxian, the district chief of the fourth district of Shanghai County (Pudong Yilin), has noted that the autumn season has arrived, and the population is more susceptible to diseases than usual. The poor and sick are unable to afford medical treatment, which is deeply regrettable. Therefore, he has ordered the second district of Puxi to issue medical care certificates. The medical care certificates have been printed and distributed to the townships and towns. The poor and sick can go to the townships and towns to obtain the certificates and go directly to the doctor's clinic for treatment. This is more convenient than setting up a medical clinic. He has already sent invitations to well-known doctors of various specialties inside and outside the district to gather at the district office on the 17th (today) to discuss the direction of the program.</p>
<h3>Sijing Fellows Association to Hold Meeting Tomorrow</h3>

Please instruct the finance departments of all provinces to reiterate the previous order to avoid repeated collection of taxes and maintain national products. The telegram has been noted. It is verified that this case was previously submitted by the factory, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce was requested to handle it. The Ministry has successively issued orders to the finance departments of Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and other provinces to investigate and instruct their subordinate tax bureaus to abide by the regulations when the factory reports the transportation of products.

<h3>Detailed Account of the Safe Escape of Huang Bohui, General Manager of the Shih Pao, After Being Kidnapped</h3>
<p>The bandits only managed to act against Mr. Huang after four months. Huang was confined in a small boat for eight hours. The two Chinese constables on the Fourth Road were derelict in their duties. The courageous rescue by the river and land police is commendable.</p>
<p>The kidnapping of Huang Bohui, general manager of the Shih Pao, was originally intended to be announced immediately to make clear to the readers of this newspaper how precarious Shanghai's security is. Due to the Public Security Bureau's pursuit of the bandits, it is only published today. At half past noon on the 15th, Mr. Huang was in front of the gate of the Shih Pao (25 Zhejiang Road) and was about to enter his own car (a convertible car with seating for five people in the front and rear) to go home. The car had not yet started when the gatekeeper suddenly said, "Wait, there is a child in the car." The gatekeeper repeatedly called, but the child did not wake up. Mr. Huang intended to drive home and then have a servant send the child back. Unexpectedly, a person suddenly came from the right and pointed a gun at Huang. Huang immediately knew that he was a kidnapper. This kidnapper ordered Huang to sit on the left side, and another bandit came from the left and sandwiched Huang in the middle. Three more people sat in the carriage behind. All five bandits held guns. The bandit on the rear right (hereinafter referred to as the rear right) said to Huang, "We have been waiting for you for four months, and we finally met you today. Please be nice and cooperative. We are all communists and lack military pay." Huang asked, "What gang are you from?" He replied, "The Tianjin Gang." At this time, although the car was started, the driver-bandit stepped on the accelerator too hard, and the car stopped horizontally on the road and could not be started again. The rear right bandit ordered Huang to find a way. Huang ignored him. The rear right repeatedly said, "If you don't find a way, I will shoot." Huang then stepped on the accelerator for him. The bandits then used second gear to drive slowly forward. The police whistle behind was loud, and people were shouting. The bandits could not drive fast (this car was bought many years ago, and the carburetor happened to have problems that day. It would stop as soon as it drove fast. Also, because the bandits were in a hurry, they did not turn on the headlights.) They drove slowly south. On the Fourth Road, two Chinese constables were standing in the middle of the road facing north (if it were peacetime, without the loud blowing of the police whistle, the constables would definitely stop and scold the car without headlights and copy the license plate). But at this time, the two constables pointed the bandits to turn on the headlights and go west. Huang thought that if he saw these two Chinese constables and asked for help, he would definitely become the second Ye Daming. At this time, after the police whistle sounded continuously, the bold ones followed. Seeing the two Chinese constables at the corner, they thought they could rescue him. Unexpectedly, the two Chinese constables stopped those who were chasing and did not allow them to chase forward. Since those who were chasing could not reach the Fourth Road, the car going west drove safely and quickly away.</p>
<p>When the car reached Xizang Road, the engine was hot. It turned north and then started driving fast. When it reached Jing'an Temple Road and went west to Mahou Road, Huang was ordered to take off his glasses and change into the blue cloth shirt prepared by the bandits. The two photos of him in the car in his white foreign gauze shirt, as well as more than twenty yuan in foreign currency and the keys, were all taken away. Because Huang had no glasses, he could not recognize the route. He only knew that the bandits were afraid of being chased and took a winding road. Before reaching the disembarkation point, he was ordered to take off his leather shoes and put on slippers. Huang asked where he was going. He replied, "To the boat." They got off at the right side of a factory and were carried by two bandits through the factory gate and turned along the river to the boat. The bandits on the boat were not awake. The bandits scolded the boat for not being alongside the dock but outside on the mudflat. Huang asked the bandits if there was a gangplank. The bandits said, "I'll carry you." He carried Huang down to the boat. A bandit in the boat (that is, the arrested one) pointed a gun at Huang. Huang asked, "Who is the leader of the bandits?" He replied, "I don't know." He asked, "Have you ever been a soldier?" He replied, "Yes." He asked, "What unit?" He replied, "Formerly in Ma Yuren's unit." They talked for about three or four minutes. An older bandit came. He was more cunning than the younger one. Huang asked, "What is your hometown?" He replied, "Yangzhou." He asked, "Is the boat going to leave? Are we going to Yangzhou?" He replied, "Waiting for the tide to go to Hangzhou." He asked, "What is the lunar date today?" He replied, "The 21st." (It was found that the tide in the Wusong River was rising at 3 o'clock on the 21st.) This bandit said, "Please rest assured, you will be free in seven days." Huang further asked, "Who is the leader of the bandits?" He said, "A Tianjin person." Huang said, "Please ask him to come." The bandit said, "He can't come. He will send someone tomorrow to ask you to write a letter according to the draft." The bandit asked, "What dishes do you want to eat tomorrow?" Huang replied, "The boat is small and easy to get sick. I only need porridge." He asked, "Do you want any side dishes?" He replied, "I don't need anything, just white porridge to drink." He asked, "Do you want salted duck eggs?" He replied, "Yes." The furnishings in the boat were extremely crude. Huang lay on a mat with a newly bought foreign porcelain washbasin and a new hand towel. Huang used this washbasin as a pillow. The air in the boat was very good. The bandit's wife first boiled a pot of hot water. Huang used it to wipe his face and body. Then she put a cup of boiling water in a new covered bowl. Huang was afraid that he would not be able to get out of the boat to urinate, so he did not drink it. When the tide came, the boat did not leave, and the bandits gradually panicked. The older one warned the younger one, "Never fall asleep. You must be careful." After half an hour, the two discussed, and only heard them say, "Twenty years old, five hundred years old (their voices were panicked). It is extremely dangerous to pass the card (Zhou Da Temple is east of Beixinjing)." At that time, the boat stopped and started repeatedly. At dawn, the bandit's wife said, "They originally wanted to go out, but I advised them to stay nearby in order to facilitate the matter." In fact, the bandits saw that there were Sixth District constables everywhere on the shore, so they did not dare to leave, nor did they dare not move. They also knew that it was not easy to pass the card. Finally, the second squadron of the water patrol came with two sampans. Those who escaped escaped, and those who arrested arrested. Huang then left the Suzhou River Bandit boat.</p>
<p>When the police whistle in the Small Garden first sounded, the staff upstairs at the Shih Pao looked out the window and thought that a car had hit a pedestrian, which was a common occurrence. They did not expect a kidnapping. When the car drove away, the gatekeeper ran upstairs to report, and they were greatly shocked. Therefore, the reporters of this newspaper immediately set out by car or telephone to report to the Public Security Bureau of the Chinese Concession and the police force to pay attention to intercepting.</p>
<p>About half an hour after the car left, the boy Yu Bingfang, who had been unexpectedly taken away by the car, suddenly returned from the south in a rickshaw. The staff of the Shih Pao immediately stopped him and asked him why. The boy said, "I was asleep on the car all the time. When I was jolted awake halfway, I saw five people crowded in the car. Mr. Huang was sitting in the front with two people sitting on either side. At the intersection of Singapore Road and Small Sandu Road, the car stopped, and the two people in the back took Mr. Huang out of the car and walked north. The front was desolate and uninhabited, and there were vague boats swaying. The car drove for another four or five minutes and stopped again. A person took out a small foreign coin to hire a rickshaw for me to return. I never understood what was happening." The Shih Pao staff thought that this boy was very suspicious, so they detained the boy and the rickshaw puller in the Laoza Gate police station.</p>
<p>After repeatedly questioning the two car boys, the Laoza Gate police station immediately sent detectives west to search. After a long time, the car was found at the corner of Singapore Road and Small Sandu Road. The detectives took the car to the police station.</p>
<p>Before dawn, at 3 o'clock, the staff of the Shih Pao had learned the location of the car. According to what the boy said, they concluded that the bandits must have hidden in the west or north of Shanghai and hid Mr. Huang on a boat to sail to other places at night. Therefore, they sent six more people in a hurry to drive to the Public Security Bureau of the 462 District and the two outposts of the Water Patrol Second Squadron of the Suzhou River and the Caogaodu Beixinjing Water Patrol Team, requesting that land and water police be immediately dispatched to patrol.</p>
<p>Finally, the staff of the Shih Pao concluded that the bandits must be in the jurisdiction of the Sixth District. At 4:15, they went to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau again. The District Chief Ren Liping and Inspector Xu Tao had just returned to the office from an external search and had only been in bed for twenty or thirty minutes. They immediately came out to meet them. After talking to each other, the District Chief also believed that the bandits must be in the Small Sandu River or in the grass sheds along the bank. Therefore, he ordered all the inspectors and police officers to prepare immediately. All the police officers jumped out of bed and were full of energy. In a blink of an eye, they were ready. One police officer was slightly late in buckling his belt and was immediately reprimanded by the District Chief. This shows his spirit of handling cases. At about 5 o'clock, armed police officers jumped onto the Shih Pao's car and drove quickly to the Suzhou River area to carry out their search. It was just dawn. When they set off, the District Chief instructed the inspectors and asked them to first go to the Water Patrol Squadron to ask for assistance.</p>
<p>Also, when the officers and police of the Sixth District first investigated, all the people in the office were dispatched, leaving only a gate guard and a servant. Director Ren also personally went out to direct the search and only returned at about 4 o'clock. He had slept for less than half an hour all night, which is very rare for his diligence.</p>
<p>Li Wenhan, the patrol officer of the Zhabei Second Squadron of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Water Patrol Team, received the news three and a half hours after the incident and immediately supervised the chief police officers to take a motorboat from Xinguangfu Road, west of the Xinzha Bridge, to search west. At the same time, the Caogaodu port in the north of the Suzhou River and the Jiangsu Provincial Water Public Security Team in Zhoujiaqiao also sent police officers on boats to search east. All ships, whether docked or sailing, were searched. When Inspector Li searched to the Tanziwan area, it was already dawn, and the Caogaodu port of the Water Patrol Team had also set out to the location of the Sixth District police officers and the police and detectives of the captain in the search of the shore had to 7:30 to the east end of the small sand and the head of the third flour factory Fuxin (south bank) near a small Jiangbei boat with a flat in front of a small shed, there was a man with his hair braided and wearing blue pants and on his body and who was hurriedly unfastening the mooring rope. Patrol Captain Ma and others was confident that the suspect's boat had no choice but to pursue it and catch it. Since the bandit knew that he could not escape, he tied the boat to the shore and led a seven- or eight-year-old child ashore and fled. There was also a woman on the bandit boat who got ashore to escape. The water police quickly stepped on the boat to arrest her. Another male bandit jumped out of the boat shed wearing blue cloth trousers with many freckles on his face. He was very fierce. The Sixth District Public Security Bureau patrol officer and the large team of police officers had arrived on the shore to search and had arrested him. A row of bullets and two bullet clips were found on his body, along with two loaded pistols on the boat board. Fearing that there were still accomplices in the cabin, the water police fired three shots into the water to show off. Who knew that there were no accomplices in the cabin, and Mr. Huang was indeed inside. At this time, the water and land police gathered, and the bandits were panicked and did not dare to resist arrest.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Huang, when the water patrol was near the bandit boat, the older, bare-chested bandit and the bandit's wife were already on the boat. The younger one (that is, the captured Zhou Wu) suddenly hid the pistol in a pile of clothes and walked onto the deck. Mr. Huang originally wanted to shoot this bandit to death with this pistol, but he was afraid that the investigators would misunderstand him. Also, because it was not clear whether the older bandit had escaped or was still in the bow of the boat, he was afraid of being hit by stray bullets during the resistance, so he lay quietly in the cabin. Later, through the gap in the boat, he saw that the bandits had been arrested, so he loudly announced that he was Mr. Huang, the kidnapped person. The patrol officers Hao Wanqin, Liu Tongyuan, Yuan Jinglong, and Xie Changjin and the patrol captain Ma Xianting asked if he was the general manager of the Shih Pao. He replied yes, so they helped him out of the boat and into a sampan. The patrol officers and patrol captain put in a lot of effort at the time, and Huang personally saw the sweat pouring down their foreheads.</p>
<p>At about 10 o'clock, the Caogaodu water patrol outpost used a small motorboat to escort Mr. Huang Bohui to the Zhabei Second Water Patrol Squadron west of the Xinzha Bridge and transferred him to the Nanshi Guanqiao Public Security Bureau Water Patrol Headquarters. The two arrested bandits were also escorted by motorboat from the Suzhou River east to the Huangpu River. Because it was against the wind and against the water, it was difficult to proceed. The staff of the Shih Pao went to the Water Patrol Headquarters to wait for him. Team Captain Xu Jishi received the news and treated him very warmly. At that time, Mr. Huang was wearing a black Xiangyun gauze short shirt and white foreign cloth trousers and was barefoot in leather shoes. The black Xiangyun gauze short shirt was borrowed from a member of the Water Patrol Team. The clothes and socks he was wearing had been taken off by the kidnappers, and his glasses had also been taken. He met with Team Captain Xu and others and recounted the kidnapping and escape. The telephones on the Water Patrol Team's boat rang continuously. They were all inquiring about Mr. Huang's safety.</p>
<p>At twelve and a half, Mr. Huang changed into new clothes and accompanied Team Captain Xu and the Shih Pao staff in a car to the Public Security Bureau to meet with the Detective Team Captain and the Third Section Chief. They talked for a long time. At about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, they returned to their residence. The two arrested bandits were interrogated by the Detective Team. The male bandit confessed that Zhou Wu, 24 years old, from Yangzhou, directly admitted to the kidnapping and guarding of Huang Bohui. He did not know where the other accomplices had fled. The female bandit, Li Wangshi, 38 years old, from Funing, only said that she was hired by the bandits to row the boat and received 200 yuan a month. She had been waiting for more than two months. Team Captain Lu Ying ordered that the seized evidence be submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning. It is heard that the Municipal Public Security Bureau will transfer the criminals to the Public Concession Special District Court for handling tomorrow or the day after tomorrow because the incident occurred in the Concession. This matter that has occurred has one point that gives rise to suspicion. When the boy Yu Bingfang saw that the car was empty, he lay down in the car. If there had been no such boy, then Mr. Huang's car could have been driven out immediately, and the kidnappers would not have been able to take action. The boy confessed at the police station that he was greedy for the cool breeze because it was hot. It is recalled that the boy was released first and will still need to be summoned in the future.</p>
<p>After the car was found, the detectives at the police station picked up a one-yuan banknote from the Bank of China in the car that had been torn in half. It is speculated that the bandits intended to intimidate the victim, but they were unexpectedly arrested by the Water Patrol.</p>
<p>The Zhabei Second Water Patrol Team Caogaodu port patrol captain Ma Xianting, patrol officers Hao Wanqin, Liu Tongyuan, Yuan Jinglong, Xie Changjin, and others, and the Sixth District Public Security Bureau Director Ren, patrol officer Xu Tao, and the police officers of the office worked very hard to search and arrest the bandits at night. The Chinese and Western detectives of the Laoza Gate police station, including Nelson, Yu Argen, Cui Chengke, Liang Chengyu, and Qiu Sijiu, were also very diligent. This is recorded here.</p>
<p>The reporter noted that Mr. Huang's family is of modest means. Because the newspaper has a close relationship with the national society, he has spared no effort to borrow money to maintain the Shih Pao for six years, and his mind and body have been exhausted. Anyone who knows a little about public welfare cannot but admire his character. But there are even bandits who plan to hurt him, and the connivance of the police almost put him in danger. It is a sigh.</p>
<h3>The Situation of Pirates Outside the Wusong Estuary is Serious</h3>
<p>Two vertical rivers in Shenjia Town were plundered. Twenty-seven residents were taken away by the pirates.</p>
<p>Recently, piracy has become increasingly rampant in the waters outside the Wusong Estuary. Major cases of robbery and kidnapping occur daily. Various details have been recorded in this newspaper. According to reports from various sources, most of these pirates wear gray uniforms and are fully armed. They also have symbols, just like a regular army. However, the water police force is weak, so the suppression has been unsuccessful, and there is no corresponding solution. At about 9 p.m. the night before, seven large five-masted sailing ships suddenly appeared in the waters outside Chongqi Outer Sand. There were more than a hundred pirates on the ships, all of whom had firearms. They sailed to the port of Shenjia Town, west of the city, and docked. Most of the pirates immediately landed and quickly surrounded the entire town, carrying out a large-scale robbery for about two hours before blowing the horn to gather. They left with the loot, shouting and whistling down the ship. Before leaving, they also took fourteen shopkeepers and residents away. At first, the people who were taken away refused to get off the ship. After resisting slightly, the bandits fired more than ten shots to show off. The people who were taken away did not dare to resist, and the bandit ships sailed towards the outer sea and escaped. After the robbery of Shenjia Town, at dawn yesterday morning, four or five more bandit ships with eighty-odd pirates sailed to the Er Tiao Shu River in the east of the city and landed to rob. Finally, they also took twelve residents away and sailed away. The locations of the two incidents were very remote, so when the bandits landed to rob and kidnap, the residents had no resistance and could not immediately report to the city.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Therefore, the bandits escaped leisurely. The losses suffered in the two places were huge. A total of twenty-seven residents were kidnapped. After the incident, the entire city was greatly shocked. The authorities were deeply afraid that the bandits would come again and have transferred a large team of land police to strictly guard along the coast. On the other hand, Gong Mianqin, the captain of the Wusong Fourth District Seventeenth Team of the Provincial Water Public Security Team, personally led the Pingyang gunboat and the patrol boats of the 123 Team to search the outer sea to encircle and suppress the bandits.</p>
<h3>Li Jialou Sings Flower Drum and Villagers Gather to Beat the Police</h3>
<p>Patrol Chief Zhu Fengyuan was injured. The leader has been arrested.</p>
<p>Li Jialou, a large village with a total of 300 households, mostly surnamed Zhao and Li, is located three miles from the Dongshi Town of Baoyi Dachang Township. The villagers all make a living by fishing, and their families are quite wealthy. The local customs are fond of practicing martial arts, and the people are strong and united. Liu Linxiang, a guest resident (formerly a retired soldier from the artillery fort garrison), initiated the singing of flower drums. Liu Maoxiang was sent to Shanghai to hire Yu Yonglin's men's and women's flower drum troupe from the Small World, agreeing on 80 yuan for two days of performance. The troupe came to the countryside on the 13th to set up a stage and perform, and the audience was exceptionally enthusiastic, with more than 2,000 people. While they were in high spirits, the branch bureau of Dachang Public Security Bureau in the city learned of it. The branch chief Gu Rixuan immediately led police officers, township district members, and the security regiment to the countryside at more than 12 o'clock in the evening to prohibit the performance. Then Chief Gu and others went on stage to give a speech, roughly stating that the current situation was unstable, the military affairs in the front were not settled, and it was not appropriate to have such activities in the rear. If our township could sing flower drums, other townships might follow suit. If bandits took the opportunity to cause trouble, it would be a major matter. At that time, the villagers agreed to stop singing immediately. Chief Gu saw that they had agreed and did not detain anyone and immediately returned to the bureau. However, the villagers resumed the performance after the regiment police left. Chief Gu and others went to the countryside for the second time at more than 2 o'clock to prohibit the performance and planned to detain the performers, which aroused the anger of the audience and caused a conflict. Because of the disparity in the number of police officers and the crowd, two blank shots were fired as a demonstration. The crowd thought that the police should not fire, so they surrounded and beat them, causing Patrol Chief Zhu Fengyuan to be injured. Chief Gu immediately ordered the arrest of Yu Yonglin, who sang the opera, and Liu Maoxiang, who hired him, and brought them to the bureau. The next day, he reported the situation to Shen Jing, the director of the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau, who forwarded it to the county government. Qiu Mingjiu, the county chief, appointed police officer Wang Dechen to supervise the inspection officer and the political police officer Wang Qing and others to the Dachang Branch Bureau to verify that Patrol Chief Zhu had several injuries on his arms, head, back, and other parts caused by fists and feet. While they were inspecting, Liu Linxiang, the initiator, relying on his reputation, accompanied a certain active-duty military officer to the bureau to request a peaceful solution. Police Chief Wang inquired about the situation and learned that Liu was the initiator and the culprit of this case. He immediately detained Liu on the spot. After the investigation was completed, Liu Linxiang, Liu Maoxiang, Yu Yonglin, and the injured Patrol Chief Zhu were taken back to the county government. After a brief interrogation by the adjudicator Huang Jian, he ordered that Liu Linxiang and the other three be detained, while Patrol Chief Zhu was sent to the hospital for treatment to await further inquiry so as to thoroughly investigate the cause of the trouble and then handle it accordingly.</p>
<h3>A Counterfeit Silver Dollar Factory Was Cracked Down on in Caishi Road</h3>
<p>Because of the mixed use of counterfeit coins, it was exposed. The criminals were interrogated and sentenced to imprisonment separately.</p>
<p>Recently, the rogue Qian Yinfang secretly set up a counterfeit silver dollar factory at No. 4 Hongning Lane, Caishi Road, in the French Concession. After making the counterfeit coins, he instigated Zhu A'er and Yao Minggao to use them outside. A few days ago, Zhu took three yuan of counterfeit coins to Ji Hongquan's grocery store at No. 5 Qianjiatang, Xiahui Road, to buy something. The store owner saw through him. Coincidentally, Bao Detective Hong Chunxiang and Guo Bingquan came to investigate and arrested Zhu. Zhu confessed to the private manufacturing of the factory. The detectives went to the house and arrested Qian Yinfang and Yao Minggao. They seized the manufacturing equipment and dozens of counterfeit coins and brought them to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the French court. The detective first reported the previous situation to the court. When Qian Yinfang was questioned, he confessed that Ye Afu, who was at large, had initiated the manufacturing. The rest of the confessions were ambiguous. Zhu and Yao both confessed that they had helped to use the coins. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Qian to one and a half years in the Western prison, Zhu to one year, and Yao to nine months to serve as a warning. The seized counterfeit coins were destroyed.</p>
<h3>Litigation Involving a Fierce Wife and Cowardly Husband</h3>
<p>The Aim Was to Seek Divorce, but the Stance Changed Suddenly in Court; Although the Judge Attempted Reconciliation, the Woman's Ferocity Made Reason Impossible</p>
<p>Chen Daorong, a 21-year-old man from Yancheng, residing at No. 1 Xinyi Lane, Changan Road, Zhabei, works diligently as a laborer at the Daishengchang steamboat wharf. Last September, through matchmakers, he married Shen Caibao (i.e., Chen Shen), a woman from the same hometown. The woman, 22 years old, works as a forewoman at the Yong'an Yarn Factory in Chadaijiao. She earns a good income and has a wide social circle, often dressing in luxurious clothes and silk stockings, unlike a woman from a modest family. Her behavior is quite frivolous, leading to much gossip. However, Chen Daorong is naturally timid and, although aware of his wife's improper conduct, could do nothing about it. As a result, the woman's arrogance increased, often beating her husband. Her mother not only did not mediate but even helped her daughter slap her son-in-law. The woman then hired lawyer Wang Chengkuan to file a divorce lawsuit with the district court, stating that she suffered abuse and could not live together, requesting a divorce judgment. She stated that when she was ten years old, her father arranged a marriage with the defendant, Chen Daorong, through a matchmaker. They married in September of last year according to the lunar calendar. Unexpectedly, after only three days, they ran out of food. The plaintiff had to borrow money to buy firewood and rice, accumulating a debt of over twenty yuan. Because of this, the plaintiff worked in a factory, hoping to maintain the household. However, the defendant dedicated himself to gambling and, besides having the plaintiff pay for the rent, insisted on the plaintiff providing financial assistance daily. When she refused, he would resort to physical violence. At the end of the twelfth lunar month of last year, the defendant even took all the plaintiff's bedding, brass basin, teapot, and mosquito net to pawn them, which the plaintiff redeemed at a price. In July of this year, he secretly took the plaintiff's clothes and belongings to a neighbor's house and relapsed into his old ways. After discovering this, she recovered the items. The defendant became angry and resumed his beatings. In March of this year, he was reported to the Public Security Bureau of the Fourth District, First Sub-Bureau twice for forcing money out of her and beating her. Although husband and wife have a mutual obligation to support each other, the defendant does not engage in honest work, forces money out of her, and resorts to beatings. The way of husband and wife is greatly suffering, and his frequent violence and infringement on the plaintiff's private property are grounds for separation. She had no choice but to request permission to grant a divorce, etc. After the defendant, Chen Daorong, received a copy of the complaint, the neighbors were outraged. The plaintiff's claims were completely unfounded. All the clothes were taken out by the woman herself, witnessed by those living in the same residence. If he was said to be dedicated to drinking and gambling and did not engage in honest work, then the foreman could provide proof. The neighbors felt indignant on his behalf and collectively elected representatives Yang Jinchen (who lived in the same residence), Liu Shiqi, and Feng Youcai, foreman of the Daishengchang steamboat wharf, who were all willing to testify in court. Chen Daorong hired lawyer Wang Xianhu to file a defense against the plaintiff Chen Shen's various improper behaviors. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Yang Keqian specially opened the Second Court to hear the case. Both parties arrived in court with their lawyers, and witnesses such as Feng Youcai, Liu Shiqi, and Yang Jinchen were present in the gallery to be called for questioning. After the judge took his seat, the plaintiff, seeing that all the witnesses were present to testify, and fearing that it would be detrimental to her divorce proceedings, immediately changed her request. The judge first asked the woman about her age and other personal information. Then asked, "Are you requesting a divorce?" She replied, "No." The judge, greatly surprised, said, "Your complaint clearly states that you are seeking a divorce. How can you say you are not seeking a divorce?" She replied, "He beats me. Now I am willing to support myself." The judge asked, "Are you ultimately requesting a divorce or requesting to live together?" She replied, "I want him to support me." The judge said, "Then you are requesting to live together." At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer, Wang Chengkuan, stood up and said, "The plaintiff initially insisted on a divorce, but now she has suddenly changed her request in court. Therefore, this lawyer has nothing to present. Please allow me to leave the court first." The judge instructed, "There is no need to leave the court." Lawyer Wang resumed his seat. According to the defendant, Chen Daorong's statement, "All the wages I earn are given to the plaintiff. The day before yesterday, she took away her clothes, etc. I argued with her slightly. Unexpectedly, my wife's mother slapped me in the face." The judge asked, "How much do you earn each month?" He replied, "About twenty-one or twenty-two yuan." The judge, upon hearing this, attempted to mediate in court, ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff eighteen yuan per month for rent and food. Any expenses for pocket money and new clothes would be borne by the plaintiff. After the reconciliation was reached, both parties signed and left the court. Unexpectedly, after leaving the court, Chen Shen stayed in the lawyers' lounge, refusing to go home with the defendant. Everyone felt indignant, believing that since she wanted to live together, she should go home with her husband and not be difficult. They urged her husband to step forward and pull her away. Unexpectedly, the woman punched her husband hard in the chest and repeatedly said, "You're hitting me! You're hitting me!" Everyone witnessed the situation and said that this woman was terrifying. As a result, the woman, seeing that she had incurred public anger, resentfully followed her husband out of the court.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hankou Aviation Suspended Every Monday</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Postal Authorities, starting from August 18th, the Shanghai-Hankou airmail route will be suspended every Monday.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Public Bus Suspends Operation on Zhaojiabang Road in the City</h3>
<p>The Public Utilities Bureau Approves Trial Operation</p>
<p>The first Shanghai South Public Bus route starts from Laoximen, passes Xiaoximen, takes the road behind the station, Guohuo Road, Wai Malu, then enters the city through Xiaodongmen and Dadongmen, circulates along Zhaojiabang Road, and returns to Laoximen. Recently, the company stated that there are few passengers on this route, and the business is sluggish, especially on Zhaojiabang Road. It plans to completely cancel this route and change the turnaround point to Xiaodongmen. Before the operation of the third route, it will drive back to Laoximen via Dadongmen and Xiaoximen, and add a railway station stop between Difangting and Hujunying to connect. The Public Utilities Bureau, according to the report, after consulting with the Public Works Bureau and sending personnel to investigate, found that the route is generally unobtrusive. However, the road surface before and after the station and Bansongyuan Road is not very firm and must be repaired selectively before traffic can pass. The company was ordered to postpone the rerouting, and the suspension of Zhaojiabang Road was approved for trial operation. However, if traffic is obstructed due to this road in the future, the original route must be restored. On one hand, the Public Works Bureau will rush to repair the road surface before and after the station and Bansongyuan Road to facilitate traffic. It is reported that the fare has been revised, starting at six cents, adding two cents at the third stop, and adding three cents at each stop thereafter, for a total fare of thirty-two cents for the entire line.</p>
<h3>Wusong Fish Market Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Wusong Fish Market, which started operating after Qingming by the Cuisheng, Baofeng, and Shengtai fish firms, has been open for four months. Because the fish season has passed, the three firms planned to hold a Xieyang (closing period) ceremony yesterday. After the Xieyang period, the various helpers will gradually return to their respective ports. The partners and staff of the three firms will also return to the Shanghai South headquarters to serve. However, the business situation of the three firms in Song this year has decreased by 30-40% compared to last year due to the impact of pirates. The total number of yellow croakers is less than 100,000 yuan. The total number of fish is more than 140,000, and dried freshwater fish is 200,000 yuan. The three firms have only done 440,000 yuan in business. According to fish industry sources, the total amount of goods is less than half of that of previous years. Because everything is expensive and funds are tight, this is the reason for the amount. Therefore, Cuisheng still has to lose money, while Baofeng and Shengtai are barely able to maintain operations. The reason for the poor business is that pirates outside the port are rampant and extremely rampant. Ship merchants are reluctant to come to Song. Not only is the fish industry greatly affected, but also the associated relations of customs duties and ship donations are not insignificant.</p>
<h3>Change of Timetable for Special Express Train between Pukou and Yanzhou</h3>
<p>The Traffic Departments of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways yesterday sent a circular to the staff of all stations under their jurisdiction, stating that they had received a telegram from the Jinpu Railway, stating that the special express trains No. 201 and No. 202, which run daily from Pukou to Yanzhou, are running slowly en route, causing occasional delays. Therefore, the departure time of the special express train from Pukou to Yanzhou has been slightly changed to 6:30 AM every day, and passengers with connecting tickets to the north on the two railways should be informed to facilitate their travel.</p>
<h3>Old Woman Commits Suicide Due to Loss of Support</h3>
<p>Gu, the wife of Lu Jia, Zheng of No. 4 Dexing Lane, behind Daxing Street, outside Xiaoximen, is over sixty years old. Although she has several sons, none of them are able to support her. Usually, her maternal nephew provides financial support, treating her very well. Because her nephew fell ill and died, she lost her support and became world-weary, hanging herself in secret yesterday. The Second District ordered a guarantee to report to the court for inspection and coffin encoffining.</p>
<h3>Patrol Officer Commits Adultery and Abduction</h3>
<p>Li Shaoshan is full of evil</p>
<p>Li Shaoshan, currently a fourth-class police officer at the First Sub-Bureau of the Fourth District in Zhabei, has been having an affair with Liu, the wife of Dong Fuhai, a person from Funing who resides at No. 819 Suian Lane, Xinjiang Road. The affair has been going on for some time. Although her husband has heard something about it, because Li is a police officer in service, he did not dare to compare himself with him. He could only often quarrel with his wife, Liu, and beat her. Unable to bear the suffering, she fled with the police officer Li without a trace. Although Dong knew that he was abducted by the police officer Li, he was angry but dared not speak because there was no evidence. The other day, the police officer Li and Liu were walking hand in hand on Kaifeng Road in the American Concession, whispering along the way, looking very intimate. Dong saw this and was filled with jealousy. He immediately twisted Li and Liu together to the Huishi police station. The head of the police station found out that the matter occurred in the Chinese boundary and sent it to the First Sub-Bureau of the Fourth District. After the director Yao interrogated and learned that the case involved a police officer committing adultery and abducting a married woman, he immediately prepared a document to explain to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Bather Dies of Stroke</h3>
<p>At the Longxingyuan bathhouse on Fangbang Road in the city, at around 10 PM the night before last, a bather, over 30 years old, wearing a white cloth short shirt and Xiangyun gauze pants, suddenly suffered a stroke and fell unconscious. The bathhouse reported to the patrol officer, who sent him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment by car. He never spoke until 9 AM yesterday morning, and the result was still incurable and he died. The First Sub-Bureau of the First District ordered Qin Defang, the head of the 23rd Shop, to report to the local court for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Woman Administers Morphine for People</h3>
<p>Sentenced to a Fine of 300 Yuan or Imprisonment for Six Months</p>
<p>A woman, Yin Wang, recently administered morphine injections for people at No. 6 Hualun Mill Street in the French Concession, charging two cents per injection. It was discovered by a detective from the French Concession Police. Wang was found to be violating the ban. The previous day, the police raided her home, confiscating twenty packets of morphine and four morphine needles, and brought them to the police station. Yesterday, they brought her to the French court for investigation. The head of the police first reported the previous situation and questioned Wang. Wang admitted that she privately administered morphine injections. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Wang to a fine of 300 yuan. If she was unable to pay the fine, she would be imprisoned for six months. The confiscated morphine needles and other items will be destroyed.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Detectives Rob 500 Yuan</h3>
<p>Wu Ziying, residing at No. 24 Jiangxi Road, was robbed of 500 yuan in cash on the morning of the 28th of last month at 9 AM while walking past Sanyangjing Bridge on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. The criminals Wang Afu, Ji Afu, and Chen Xiaoshuangzi, etc., impersonated detectives, blocked the way, and searched him under the pretext of searching for something. Afterwards, the victim reported to the police station, who ordered detectives to arrest Wang and the other three. Yesterday, they were brought to the French court for investigation. The plaintiff first complained about the situation of being robbed. Wang and others confessed that it was Chen Arer who was at large who initiated the invitation to the people to rob the earth. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Wang Afu to three months in the Western prison, and Ji and Chen each to two months as a warning.</p>
<h3>Borrowing Usurious Loans, Debts Too Heavy</h3>
<p>Woman Commits Suicide by Swallowing Opium</p>
<p>Wang Yue, a woman from Ningbo, 34 years old, formerly lived in Wenyuanfang on Pishao Nai Road. Four days ago, she moved to No. 21 Bing'an Lane, Aige Road. The day before yesterday, due to heavy debts from borrowing usurious loans, she quarreled with her lover, a certain Jia, and suddenly had a short-sighted idea. On the 15th, she swallowed raw opium and committed suicide. Unexpectedly, her lover fled the scene. It was not until the poison took effect that the cohabitant noticed and sent her to Renji Hospital.

<h3>Youth Throws Himself into the River</h3>
<p>Boatman's Rescue Ineffective</p>
<p>The Yingmei Tobacco Factory (Xi Haideng) No. 1 small wheel on Lujiazui, Pudong, loaded passengers at the Nanjing Road Wharf at 4 PM the day before yesterday and sailed to Pudong. Among the passengers, there was a young man wearing a blue striped cloth short shirt and black cloth pants, about eighteen or nineteen years old, who suddenly left a suicide note and jumped into the river to commit suicide while people were unprepared. After being discovered by the old sailors, they immediately stopped and tried to rescue him, but it was too late and the body sank without a trace. The suicide note was opened and only contained the words "(Wang Changjin, Hangzhou. Mr. Wang Jilin of No. 26 Bridge, Unfilial Son Bites Navel)," etc. The old man sent the letter to the patrol station for filing that night.</p>
<h3>Suspicious Youth Found in Pudong</h3>
<p>No Contraband Found on Body, but Words are Suspicious</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the members of the Pudong Yangjing District Defense Team patrolled through Qichangzhan Township and discovered a suspicious youth named Huang Nianzu. The next morning, they sent a letter to the Third District of the Public Security Bureau. According to Huang's confession, he was 21 years old, from Pinghu. He was studying in a school in his original hometown, but dropped out this year and came to Shanghai to seek a job, but failed. He stayed at the Risheng Inn on Wuma Road. Then he said he stayed at Shuntai and Xinquanxing Inns. His words were contradictory. He also claimed that he had an uncle, Huang Jieli, working as a clerk in the accountant's office of Pan Xulun in this port. Recently, due to economic difficulties, he came to Pudong to seek a loan from a friend, etc. Then they checked his body and found no contraband. The district used the telephone to inquire about the Pan Accountant's Office and replied that there was no Huang Jieli. It was clear that the youth's confession was false and the situation was extremely suspicious. He was sentenced to be sent to the General Bureau for disposal.</p>
<h3>Three People Died from Electric Shock</h3>
<p>Chen Ruiqing, a young worker at the Zhabei Hydroelectric Plant, Chen Ruiqing, was still a child at heart. The other day, he saw a butterfly flying into the factory. Chen was happy to see it, and jumped and caught it, waving his hands randomly. But as a result, the butterfly was not caught, and his hand climbed on the electric wire, sacrificing a life for the butterfly. Yesterday, Jin Hanzhai, an employee of the factory, reported to the local court. Prosecutor Xu and others came to the scene to verify the matter and ordered the body to be collected.</p>
<p>Jin Adong, a truck driver for Renfeng Lumber Company at the Zhuhang Wharf in the South City, Jin Adong, was 23 years old, from Nanxiang. The night before last, because the truck was damaged, he repaired it. Because he connected the electric lights, he unexpectedly touched the electric current and fell to the ground unconscious. He was sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, but was ineffective and died yesterday. The First Sub-Bureau of the First District ordered Qin Defang, the head of the 23rd Shop, to report to the local court for an autopsy and ordered to wait for an autopsy today.</p>
<p>Li Yingfa, a 22-year-old apprentice from Shaoxing at the Zhuang Mingji Electric Repair Shop at No. 576 Beijing Road, Zhejiang Road, was repairing an electric fan at about 9:45 PM last night when he accidentally touched the electric current and fainted to the ground unconscious. Someone flew to report to the patrol at Post No. 1576 and arrived and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment by car. However, he was unable to be rescued and died on the way. He was immediately transferred to the autopsy station to wait for the autopsy.</p>
<h3>Suicide by Taking Poison Due to Unemployment</h3>
<p>Huang Changxian, a 19-year-old Zhejiang native living at No. 6 Ping'an Lane, outside Laobeimen, suddenly felt economic hardship at home due to unemployment and had a short-sighted idea. At about 6 PM yesterday evening, he swallowed opium paste in an attempt to die. Before long, he vomited and groaned incessantly. His brother noticed and hurriedly sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, the medicine was ineffective and he died at 8:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Yan Shibao Never Went to Wenzhou</h3>
<p>How Could He Have Committed a Crime in Wenzhou?</p>
<p>The Yongjia County Government of Zhejiang Province transferred a document to the Special District Local Court, stating that Yan Shibao, a Shanghai resident residing at No. 131 Xinji Bang Road, had committed an important case in Wenzhou and requested that he be arrested and transferred to the court for trial. The court immediately issued a ticket to arrest Yan, but Yan hired a lawyer to oppose the transfer. The merchants and residents of Xinji Bang Road jointly guaranteed that he would be tried after verification. This newspaper has reported that Judge Ge Zitan of the Special District Court opened a court yesterday morning for continued hearing. Lawyer Zhang Dayin of the patrol station still claimed that the defendant had lived in the concession for many years. If the inland official wanted to transfer him, there should be sufficient evidence to prove the alleged crime, etc. Questioning Yan, he confessed that he used to work on the Yangtze River ships of the Taikoo Company and now works in the fire brigade. He has never been to Wenzhou. A friend, Zhu Abao, obtained a position in a steamboat rice contract and needed to deposit 4,000 yuan. He borrowed from a Cantonese man named Qiu, introduced by him. Later, Zhu was defrauded and lost all the money. Qiu stayed at the Dongya Hotel of Sincere Company and asked him for compensation, but he was not a guarantor and did not want to bear this unwarranted responsibility. Qiu was furious and said that if he did not compensate, he would show him. At that time, he was afraid of not being able to escape and started arguing. Now there is indeed this method to show me, etc. He also hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him, saying that no one from Yongjia County has come to court, which shows that the so-called report from the secret agent is false. The defendant has been detained for a long time and requested permission to be released on bail. More than ten merchants who were willing to guarantee Yan also sent people to court to provide guarantee. Judge Ge instructed the defendant to remain in custody for the time being and wait for a letter from the Yongjia County Government to provide a detailed account of the case and whether there is any evidence before making a further decision.</p>
<h3>Autopsy of Yu Zhao's Death by Taking Poison</h3>
<p>Zhao, the wife of Yu, who lived at No. 129 Hongfu Lane, Xinzha Road, suddenly swallowed opium paste on the morning of the day before yesterday. The rescue was ineffective and she died on the same day. The responsible patrol station reported the incident and sent a detective to Renji Hospital to carry the body to the autopsy station on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo, commissioned by the Special District Local Court, came to the scene to determine the cause of death. According to the head of the patrol, the deceased took poison out of anger after quarreling with her husband. However, according to the deceased's mother, Zhao Yue, her daughter had a history of heart pain and took opium paste for treatment whenever it occurred. Yesterday morning, the old illness relapsed and she took too much opium paste, which led to her death. Mr. Guo had Zhao Yue sign a statement to claim the body for coffin burial.</p>
<h3>Origin of Hemp Bags Unknown</h3>
<p>Guo Zhaokun, a Zhenjiang native who opened a secondhand shop at No. 336 Yangzhou Road, was found to have purchased 27 hemp bags of unknown origin worth 4 yuan by Shen Yuzhou, a Chinese detective of the Yangshupu Patrol Station. Yesterday afternoon, he secretly went to the address to arrest Guo and brought the original stolen goods back to the police station. The head of the patrol ordered him to be detained and sent to the Special District Court for interrogation.</p>

When the train passed over the bridge, the old woman panicked and failed to avoid it in time, resulting in her being crushed to death by the locomotive. The conductor reported to the head of Jiashan Station to send police to take care of the matter and inform the local guarantor to summon the corpse relatives to come to the station to identify the body and prepare a coffin for collection. Because the deceased was poor, the railway bureau provided 20 yuan to the local guarantor to prepare a coffin for collection.</p>
<h3>Woman Involved in Abduction Case Sentenced</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment, Suspended for Two Years</p>
<p>Ni You, a woman from Haimen, went to Suzhou the previous month to abduct a 15-year-old girl, Yang Amei, to Shanghai. She was arrested and handed over to the Special District Local Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, the date for sentencing arrived. The patrol station brought the woman and the girl to court. Judge Feng opened the court and sentenced Ni You to six months imprisonment for abducting a woman under the age of 20. Amei was sent to the Jiliang Institute for custody. The defendant's lawyer, Lin Yingqing, requested that the court consider the woman's ignorance and unintentional violation of the criminal law and exercise extrajudicial benevolence to enable her to repent. After reviewing the case, Judge Feng found that the woman did not intentionally abduct the girl and was somewhat excusable, so he immediately announced a two-year suspended sentence.</p>

He used to be in the medicinal material business, but Diao loved to drink alcohol. He then suffered economic stimulation and developed a nervous illness, which led to unemployment. Although he sought medical treatment, it stopped and started over time. Later, his aunt paid for his marriage and he had a son and two daughters. He depended on his aunt and nephews for a living. Whenever Diao's dementia occurred, he would run away in all directions and not return all night. On the 9th of this month, Diao suddenly got up in the middle of the night due to the hot weather and said that the fourth prince of the Sea Dragon King was marrying Miss Zhao Zilong today and that he wanted to go to congratulate them. Then he walked out. It has been a week since the incident, and he has not returned home. His wife and aunt are afraid that there will be an accident and have asked the British and French police stations, all police districts, and the Water Patrol Bureau and Lifeboat Bureau to pay attention.

<h3>The Fudan Experimental High School Uproar Has Reached a Stalemate</h3>
<p>The teacher-student conflict at Fudan Experimental High School over the replacement of the principal has not been resolved for over a month. According to Mr. So-and-So, a senior Fudan alumnus, Fudan Experimental High School was established many years ago. The position of principal was initially held concurrently by Guo Renyuan, the former director of the Fudan Psychology Institute. After Guo resigned, Liu Dabai and Chen Wangdao successively held the position. During Chen's tenure, Fudan Experimental High School and the university department signed a regulation that clearly stipulated that the president of Fudan University would serve as the principal of the experimental high school, and the principal would be selected by the faculty and staff congress from a list of three candidates chosen by the president. Regarding the hiring and firing of faculty and staff, the principal would decide after consulting with the president. This time, Principal Li Denghui hired Wang Shiying as principal after Chen Wangdao resigned for personal reasons. The procedure cannot be said to be wrong. However, some old faculty and staff at the experimental high school misunderstood the situation at the time, believing that the principal selected by Principal Li should be Li Baochen, who received the most votes at the faculty and staff congress. In fact, the number of votes received by the candidates for principal has nothing to do with the selection criteria for the principal. Since Principal Li is the highest administrative leader of the experimental high school, he has the right to decide on the candidate. Unfortunately, those who are ignorant of the original meaning of the regulations organized a school protection committee and issued a declaration attacking the principal. Later, three Fudan students, Jiang Yiping, Zhou Yueran, and Zhang Tinghao, acted as mediators in a personal capacity. The conditions they proposed were: [T13]1[/T] The school protection committee apologizes to Principal Li; [T13]2[/T] Chen Wangdao returns to the school as acting principal and Wang resigns; [T13]3[/T] The appointment letters issued by Principal Li to the faculty and staff are naturally valid. Principal Li and the school protection committee agreed to the above three points. However, Chen stated that he could not return to his post unless Principal Li canceled the issued appointment letter, which led to the failure of the mediation. According to the mediators, if all parties could sincerely accept the three proposed conditions, whether they were reasonable or not, this incident might have come to an end. However, on August 5, new complications arose, and the disputes increased, making it impossible to resolve the conflict. Principal Li instructed Principal Wang to take over the position, but the important documents of the experimental high school were suddenly taken away. At the same time, Principal Li went to the school to work, but the takeover was obstructed. The conflict has escalated. It is hoped that the president and board of directors of Fudan University will take action.</p>

<h3>A Word of Advice</h3>
<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>The modern marriage market is undergoing drastic changes, much like the stock market. Young men and women are betting their entire happiness on a single throw of the dice, and countless are failing.</p>
<p>Married women can be divided into two main categories: wives and merely married women. Wives take household chores as their responsibility, personally handling everything and treating their husbands as husbands. Merely married women spend their days outside, clueless about cooking, and treat their husbands as their entertainment.</p>
<p>When future women marry future men, they should establish a contract similar to those in business, to safeguard their lifelong or temporary happiness.</p>
<p>If men could see their wives as girlfriends, and wives could see their husbands as superiors, then there would be no quarrels in the home.</p>
<p>Some say that if two people love the same thing, they will admire each other. However, this only applies between a man and a woman; it doesn't work between two men or two women.</p>
<p>A man needs at least two women in his life: a wife and a lover, an ordinary companion and a vacation pastime.</p>
<p>Unmarried men can be divided into three categories: the unmarried by conscience, who believe they shouldn't marry; the unmarried by nature, who have no desire to marry; and the unmarried by self-control, who decide they don't want to marry.</p>
<p>When buying a horse, you look at its appearance, coat color, age, and size. But marrying a wife is not so easy. Beyond appearance, you also need to see through her heart.</p>
<p>Marriage is like a mirror, from which you can see the true face of your wife or husband.</p>
<h3>Lantern Festival Competition at the Seashore</h3>
<p>— A Mandala Studio Dispatch from Qingdao</p>
<p>Qingdao is located on the coast of the East Sea and is particularly known as a summer resort. The Huiquan Seaside Bathing Beach is famous throughout the world. This year, bathers organized a lantern competition scheduled for the night of August 9th. As scheduled, the lanterns were lit, and the seaside was filled with the fragrance of clothing and hair, and the sounds of carriages and horses. The bustling scene was like entering the streets of Shanyin during the Lantern Festival of ancient times, when the city was open all night. Although war raged, and the battle clouds of the Jiaoji Railway were pressing, the splendor and music temporarily adorned the scene. In the competition, each bathing room displayed colorful electric lights, each vying for ingenuity, as bright as day. One room was covered with a canopy of branches and green leaves, with red electric bulbs hanging inside, creating a dreamlike atmosphere. They even captured textile-weaving insects and placed them on top of the canopy, adding to the novelty. Many room owners erected high platforms on the roofs, laid out mats and tables, and invited guests. The lanterns were mostly made of electric bulbs, with some paper lanterns purchased from Japanese markets. Several small boats floated on the sea, decorated with electric torches arranged in patterns. One boat used white electric bulbs to form a square, surrounded by red electric bulbs to form a circle, erected on the boat to represent the Japanese national emblem. The Japanese express their national ideology wherever they go. The lantern flag was probably intended to outdo others in ingenuity, but the design was too simple to be truly astonishing. A wooden frame several meters high was erected on the beach to launch fireworks. First, new and exotic fireworks from China and abroad were set off, some soaring into the clouds and exploding into shooting stars with a loud bang, others spiraling upwards and shooting out sparks, and others displaying a myriad of flowers, with smoke trailing in the shape of tree branches. The performers, bare-chested and bare-armed, held the explosives and danced, and hid them in paper-mâché lions and horses, sending sparks flying as they chased back and forth, eliciting cheers. Finally, the Guangdong fireworks were launched. With a bang, the lantern flowers bloomed brilliantly, with lotus platforms and pagodas, brocade screens with flowers and birds, figures of people and horses moving back and forth, and lanterns arranged in various shapes. People in the audience said that these were specially transported from Guangdong and cost hundreds of gold coins. The bathing event had a lantern competition with prizes and publicly elected Mrs. Afrek, Mrs. Zhang Jiongbo, Mrs. Powell, Mrs. Takahashi, and Mr. Lingna as judges and notaries. When the event was held, nearly ten thousand people came. The navy and public security teams sent many people to the scene to maintain order. The public security bureau had designated routes for carriages and parking places in advance. Returning near midnight, I still saw shoulders rubbing and people pushing, an endless stream. Looking at the scene from near and far, the shadows of people and the lights created a magnificent spectacle, truly a grand event.</p>
<h3>A Bride Price of 1.2 Million Pounds</h3>
<p>— Ji Jin</p>
<p>Virginia in the United States is famous for its tobacco. A businessman named Shi Gaodeng operated his business with very little capital and made a great profit in more than ten years, earning him the title of millionaire. He has now retired and is living a wealthy life. Last month, his second son, Frank, married Miss Descartes. Before the marriage, Shi had said that he wanted to give a small portion of his family property as a bride price, but the amount was unknown even to his family. On the day of the wedding, after the new couple met in the hall, Shi, with a smiling face, personally gave an envelope to his new daughter-in-law without saying what it was. The guests were surprised and urged her to open it, revealing a check for 1.2 million pounds from a bank. The enormous bride price was astonishing. It is said that the new couple will travel around the world for a week for their honeymoon with this large sum of money.</p>
<h3>Amusing Anecdotes About Watermelons</h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>Eating watermelon in the scorching weather is a pleasure. The past few days have been filled with slicing and devouring watermelons, and I recall various amusing anecdotes about them, which I am recording for this publication to entertain readers.</p>
<p>I have always been accustomed to serving guests watermelon, always taking half and inserting a metal fork or spoon for them to dig in and eat. To serve it in small slices would be disrespectful. A Mr. Chen last spring married a woman from Shanghai. One hot summer day, a guest came to visit, and Chen instructed his wife to get a watermelon. The wife sliced it carefully, placed it on a plate, and presented it. Chen was furious when he saw it, but stopped himself from speaking because the guest was present. After the guest left, he urgently told his wife that to show respect, she should take half a watermelon, not slice it into small pieces. The wife nodded in agreement. The next day, more than a dozen colleagues from Chen's company came to visit. Remembering the previous day's disrespect, the wife sliced all the watermelons in the house in half. Calculating that it was still not enough, she quickly sent a servant to buy more from the "Tuk Tuk" (a type of rickshaw puller) household. After that, she brought out the watermelons, thinking that she would please her husband today. Unexpectedly, Chen was even more furious, secretly lamenting her incorrigible foolishness. After the guests had left, he summoned his wife and scolded her, saying that watermelon should not be sliced into small pieces, but matters require discretion. If there are many guests and not enough watermelon, then slice the watermelon and put the pulp in bowls. How can you give each guest half a watermelon? If there are few guests, people will only get half a watermelon. Moreover, the watermelons today were all as big as a dou (a unit of measurement), and many guests could not finish them, leaving a mess on the table. The guests would not feel your respect and would only laugh at your foolishness. The wife said, "I didn't know this local custom. Why didn't you tell me earlier instead of blaming me now? Besides, today's matter is exactly what you taught me yesterday." Chen said, "Entering a new place, ask about the local customs. That's what a new bride should do. There are many things like this that you should learn." The wife wanted to say more, but her mother-in-law came out, so she stopped.</p>
<p>Long ago, at the Feihong School, there was heavy snowfall in winter, like flying catkins. Wang Guiying suddenly brought half a watermelon and placed it on my desk with a smile, saying, "Today is cold, and watermelon is cold in nature, so it's the perfect seasonal treat." I thought it was handmade and didn't pay attention. The student said, "It's genuine imported goods!" I glanced at it and indeed felt it wasn't fake. The flesh was red, and the seeds were black. I took a small piece and tasted it, and it was as cold as ice, just like a regular watermelon. I asked with a smile where it came from. The student said that a Japanese person had brought it from his country and gave two to his father, so he said it was an "Eastern Ocean" (Japanese) product. Colleagues asked and learned about it and gathered around to taste it, and everyone laughed and enjoyed themselves. Eating watermelon in the winter is an amusing anecdote.</p>
<p>I remember the educator Yang Pingyu once said that watermelon is an animal, not a plant. When asked why, he said that watermelon has a "niang" (瓤, pulp, which sounds like "mother" in Chinese) and children. The "niang" even has names like "Red Niang," "Snow Niang," and "Yellow Niang," all incomparably fragrant and beautiful. Since watermelon has a mother and children, then how can it not be an animal? Those who heard this roared with laughter.</p>
<p>This year, the crafts teacher in our school instructed the students to each make a watermelon, shaping crumpled paper into a ball, covering it with thick paper, and painting it with colors, making it look like a real watermelon. Piles of them were on the table, and the young students were delighted and drooled. The teacher told them it was made of paper, but they didn't believe him and stood around watching. Then he had them pick it up, and they realized it was as light as a ball, and they finally understood. But when they left, they still looked back again and again, even though they knew it was inedible, they still felt it was cute and fun.</p>
<h3>Trivial Notes on Mr. Zheng Run's Medicine Names</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw Mr. Run's "Trivial Notes on Medicine Names," which said that on the front eaves of a public bus, there was a glass plate with the words "Bu Er Duo" (補爾多) formed, indicating a new medicine made by the Jiufu Company, with "Zha Ju Er" (軋局爾), extracted from cod liver oil, as the main ingredient, divided into pure and compound types, with many tonic effects, and so on. This differs from what I recently saw. I previously saw in the newspaper that the new medicine from Jiufu Company was "Bu Li Duo" (補力多), not "Bu Er Duo," but the fact that "Zha Ju Er" was the main ingredient was as Mr. Run said. This is a new type of modified tonic, so it is divided into pure and compound types, one for ordinary weak people who want to be stronger, and one for treating lung diseases, coughs, and other deficiency conditions. The effects are different, as those with some medical knowledge will know. As for what was seen on the front eaves of the bus, it was also the words "Bu Li Duo," and it was a recently popular red advertisement made of glass tubes, neither egg-yellow nor on the front eaves of the public bus. It was actually on the front eaves of the company's cargo truck, and no second truck has been found to have this red glass tube advertisement, which is likely another innovation by the company.</p>
<h3>Recent Events in France</h3>
<p>— Liu Zeng, from Paris</p>
<p>Since the London Naval Conference, where Italy insisted on naval parity between France and Italy, relations between the two countries have become increasingly strained. The news media of both countries have attacked each other, and both governments have taken extreme positions. A major war in the Mediterranean seems imminent. Although this serious situation is like a sudden storm, there are some circumstances worth noting, which I will briefly describe below.</p>
<p>Not long after the close of the London Naval Conference, French Foreign Minister Briand, British Foreign Secretary Henderson, and Italian Foreign Minister Grandi met in Geneva during a League of Nations meeting and discussed the Franco-Italian naval issue. At that time, it was decided that the governments in Paris and Rome would first discuss the issue in writing, and then hold a meeting when there was some progress. Unexpectedly, not long after, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini gave speeches in Livorno, Florence, Milan, and other places, expressing provocative remarks and launching fierce attacks on France. French Foreign Minister Briand immediately declared that discussions were difficult to proceed under these circumstances, and the Franco-Italian negotiations were announced to be suspended indefinitely. At this time, the international atmosphere had reached a critical point. Newspapers and magazines in France and Italy had already published articles analyzing each other's military strength, and the situation was extremely dangerous, as one can imagine.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Mussolini also published an article in the United Press, criticizing French Foreign Minister Briand's proposed European Union and declaring that the realization of the European Union could not be achieved until the existing treaties of various countries had undergone a thorough review and revision. Public opinion was in an uproar, and some even said that there was a considerable alliance between Italy and Germany. Fortunately, the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a reply to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the proposed European Union, with wording more conciliatory than Mussolini's remarks, and thus people's minds were somewhat at ease.</p>
<p>On July 10, French Foreign Minister Briand expressed the French government's attitude towards the Franco-Italian issue to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, and the atmosphere was even more moderate. Briand declared that the French government should make every effort to maintain peace, and there was no possibility of war in Europe now.</p>
<p>Recently, France proposed that France and Italy agree to a naval holiday until the end of the year, stopping the construction of new ships. Thus, the various rumors of recent months have temporarily calmed down. The question now is whether France and Italy have sincere intentions for peace and can compromise. The future of the Franco-Italian issue depends entirely on the efforts of the diplomats of the two countries in the next six months.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (256)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen: Who Unintentionally Plants Good Fortune and Receives a Diamond Ring? Only This One Sings of the Golden Tower with Heart</p>
<p>Since Zuo Shichen's beloved son died, he was inevitably depressed. Ling Zhixiang, Long Ziyun, and other old friends said that he should borrow wine to dispel his sorrow and look at flowers to relieve his mood, so they often dragged him along on outings. One day, Ling Zhixiang wanted to host a dinner party at Yi Yuanyuan's house in Tingjun Lane. Knowing that Zuo Shichen also knew Yi Yuanyuan's stage name, he came to join his partnership company. It turned out that what Ling Zhixiang was doing was not with Yi Yuanyuan but with Yi Yuanyuan's older sister, Lao Liu. This time, it was unknown which of their sisters' birthday it was, but Ling Zhixiang suddenly had a grand idea to host ten tables of wine for her on the same night. Celebrating birthdays in the entertainment district was not a fixed thing, but it was a way to knock on their guests, to create a spectacle for them, using the excuse of celebrating a birthday to collect money. This trend of using birthdays to collect money has not changed to this day. In the late Qing Dynasty, there was a type of local security guard in some places called a "dibaofang." That kind of place was good at celebrating birthdays, holding two birthdays every year, often assigning a small red note door-to-door to the households under their jurisdiction. People would send him one hundred cash, or two hundred cash, the amount was not much. This was a behavior of the lower classes, leeching off others. Secondly, we should talk about prostitutes celebrating their birthdays. If their business was good, or they felt that several guests were qualified or likely to host a dinner party, they would initiate a birthday celebration, gathering many guests who could host a dinner party, like the introductory examination of the late Qing Dynasty or the examination of the National Government, setting a date for you to serve on time. After initiating a birthday celebration, those with deep pockets would continue for more than ten days, and those with fewer guests would stop after three or five days. Ling Zhixiang was a friend who liked to make a big splash. He proposed that five friends from Tingjun Lane should each invite a double table, which would be ten tables of wine. Even if each table had eight guests, there would be eighty guests. Wouldn't that be a grand event? Zuo Shichen didn't quite believe it at the time, saying that the smaller entertainment venues in Shanghai didn't have more than one or two rooms, and the larger ones like Cai's in Rixin Lane didn't have more than three or four rooms. How could they accommodate ten tables of wine at the same time? Ling Zhixiang said, "Have you ever been to the tea house in Tingjun Lane? Then you naturally don't know. However, you have already called Yi Yuanyuan's stage name twice, so I say you have the necessity to host a dinner party. Go and see their house that day. Don't say ten tables of wine, even if you add a few more tables, they can accommodate it. Fortunately, Yi Yuanyuan's father runs a restaurant, so they will handle the wine. Because they have too many sisters, and the more sisters there are, the more rooms there are. They are the only ones in Tingjun Lane, so when you mention Tingjun Lane, you know it's their place. Many of their sisters have adopted the open-door policy, not the closed-door policy. At that time, in whose room can we not eat wine and gamble?"</p>

<h3>Gold Market View on Rollover Day</h3>
<p>Bulls Paying Forward at Most Ten Taels Beyond October, Market Sentiment Extremely Volatile</p>
<p>The gold market situation on the 16th, yesterday, was quite volatile. The morning saw strength, but the afternoon weakened. There were hidden undercurrents at times, and there was even a tortuous fluctuation of ten taels, making people's hearts uneasy and difficult to predict. As the exchange began its rollover period, the October term entered the market. The bulls were paying forward, and the closing price had already dropped slightly beyond sixty taels. In the morning, it was three or four taels, but there were very few transactions. Afterwards, the bulls were unwilling to rollover easily, so it gradually increased to five or six taels. If calculated according to the listed price, it was six taels and some change. Then, it suddenly surged to more than ten taels, and finally returned to eight or nine taels, which is a rare phenomenon in recent years. It is said that most of the bulls intended to take delivery and were willing to pay the interest to preserve cash. However, the shorts were panicked because they had sold too many amounts. (According to the regulations of the exchange, those who do not take delivery should add three taels to the Donghui listed price.) As a result, the rollover period caused a sharp rise. As for the September term, it was not traded as usual and was generally changed to the October term. The opening price was 570 taels and 0.07 yuan, the maximum price was 580 taels and 0.06 yuan, the minimum price was 569 taels, and the closing price at noon was 572 taels and 0.08 yuan, which was 6.01 taels higher than the previous day. This is based on the listed price for October. In the afternoon, the market closed as usual due to Saturday.</p>
<p>The Trend of Initial Strength and Subsequent Decline in the October Term Market, Initial Rise and Subsequent Fall, With Public Transactions Not Prosperous, With Complex Supply and Demand Among Various Firms, and With Exchange Notes Initially Tight and Subsequently Deficient. The market opened at 8:00 AM, initially at 564.5 taels. Large silver, both near and far terms, shrank by 0.08 yuan. The fixed silver price was 0.083 yuan lower, so people's hearts were shaken, and the buying side also became active. It rose from 563.5 taels to 571 taels. The foreign exchange was firm. English gold absorbed over 7 pence 0.125 at the Bank of England. However, when the announcement that the listed price should not be moved was made, it immediately returned to a little over one tael, calculated at 569.5 taels. Afterwards, the exchange notes turned loose, and the selling pressure from Taikang, Run Yongcheng, Changyuancheng, and Yongdeng was fierce, so the price turned sharply downward, falling violently by as much as 8 or 9 taels. However, there were not many foreign exchange transactions. The An Da bought English gold at 7 pence 0.1875 in October, Datong and Mitsubishi did September for 38.875 yuan at Citibank. However, people's hearts were not stable. Until after 11:00 AM, it suddenly fell to 560.5 taels. Then, it was bought by Chengfeng, Yongdeng, and others, and it went up again by more than 4 taels. After 11:30 AM, the sellers continued to sell, dropping 2 or 3 taels. At noon, it was 562 taels. Finally, it closed at 563.8 taels, and then it was raised by Tai Chang and others to buy 100 or 200 taels.</p>

<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Continue to Rise Significantly</h3>
<p>The entire Sixth Series and Second Issue, along with Continuations, have reached a transaction volume of over 15.5 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the securities market saw scattered spot trading of various public bonds, while the futures market was even more active than before. However, besides a few types such as Customs Tax, Reorganization, Troop Reduction, and Post-Disaster Relief, which saw significant activity, other bonds remained calm. The trend of various bonds was positive due to the favorable current situation, and buyers were increasingly active in investing and acquiring. Although some were actively selling to realize profits, buying power was very strong. In the morning, Customs Tax, Reorganization, Troop Reduction, and other Continuations rose by one to one and a half yuan. The second round turned slightly looser, but the transactions from the market as a whole were still brisk, with various Continuations rising by several jiao to two yuan compared to the previous day. Among the rest, the Post-Disaster Relief rose by about eight jiao, which was relatively large. Others only saw fluctuations of one or two jiao. It is estimated that spot transactions for the whole day only reached 9,000 yuan, while futures reached a total of over 15.5 million. The Securities Exchange announced that due to the still hot weather, the afternoon closing auction would remain suspended for two weeks.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn and Flower Market Slightly Shows Improvement</h3>
<p>Spot sales of cotton yarn are still sluggish, and all syndicates lack vitality. However, sentiment remains firm, and buying pressure is strong. Some are cautiously observing, and trading is stagnant. Sixteen-count and twenty-count yarn are accumulating daily in various factories, and they are sold off when prices rise. Japanese merchants have a pessimistic outlook. It is found that Japanese factories have opened up contracts for August, September, October, November, December to January, February, and March of next year, totaling about 150,000 to 160,000 bales, all purchased by fellow traders and customer syndicates to await resale. After these are sold, the market should undergo a change.</p>
<p>Man-Marked Yarn: Buyers are determined. The opening of the Man-Marked Yarn market was met with strong enthusiasm, with many anticipating a rebound in American cotton prices, leading to aggressive buying. Most months rose by five to six qian. In the second and third rounds, the market slightly fell as large traders sold off, resulting in a three qian increase across all months. In the afternoon, the market situation remained firm, with three-grade yarn rebounding by two to three yuan, further bolstering sentiment. Monthly increases and decreases were one qian. The total transaction volume for the day was estimated at 14,550 bales. It was found that Līchāng sold 2,600 bales, Dáfēng 1,000 bales, Tiānlóng 1,600 bales, Dàchāngchéng 1,850 bales, Méijì 1,000 bales, and Yílóng, Hénchāng, Déjì, Màojì, Sēnkāng, and Shēngtài sold 350 to 600 bales. Hànfēng bought 1,050 bales, Tàixīng 650 bales, and Shēnxīn, Dájì, Tàichāng, Xiéshēng, Dàfú, Héshèn, Héngyì, Tóngyú, Tàishēng, Kāngguǎng, Fēngshèn, and Yǒngchāng bought 200 to 600 bales. The closing prices of Man-Marked Yarn are recorded below:</p>
<p>Man-Marked Yarn Closing Prices: Increase/Decrease - Balance</p>
<p>November: 15.02 - Rise 0.03 - 323,008</p>
<p>August: 15.81 - Fall 0.01 - 150,500</p>

<p>September: 15.79 - Rise 0.02 - 234,000</p>
<p>January: 15.72 - 488,000</p>
<p>October: 15.74 - Rise 0.02 - 363,000</p>
<p>Spot demand is scattered, so sales of spot yarn remain sluggish. It is found that the total purchases by various syndicates for the day were estimated at 453 bales, with fellow traders taking in 250 bales. Prices were flat. Among customer syndicates, Yunnan took in 108 bales, inland areas 55 bales, Fujian 45 bales, Wuhu 30 bales, Niuzhuang 30 bales, Southeast Asia 20 bales, Hankou 40 bales, and miscellaneous syndicates 70 bales.</p>
<h3>Hankou Cotton Market Turns Bullish</h3>
<p>Three-Grade Yarn Rises, American Cotton Shows Signs of Rebound</p>
<p>The 12.25 cent level for American cotton has already been broken, and judging from the over-selling in Southern agriculture, the situation is likely to continue to decline. However, the majority of buyers in the local market believe that American cotton, after falling for six consecutive days, may rebound and continue to buy more. Furthermore, the weather is relatively bad, and they are unwilling to relax. But judging from the state of American cotton, it is difficult to establish a firm position, and with the four-liang (half a pound) barrier broken, some who have profited are using it to offset the market, making the situation tighter. Manufacturers' attitudes are very cold, and they are not inquiring about new cotton because there are ample stocks of old cotton.</p>
<p>Hankou Marked Yarn: Multiple parties are increasing their positions. The opening of the Hankou Marked Yarn market saw a sudden surge in enthusiasm, with buyers adding to their positions because of signs of a reversal in symptoms for cotton. However, sellers are also increasing their positions, with prices rising by one qian across all months. The market atmosphere remained calm at the opening of the afternoon session. At closing, the anticipated rise in the majority of foreign cotton due to the rebound in three-grade yarn led to a further increase of five fen to one qian across all months. The total transaction volume for the day was estimated at 46,600 dan. It was found that Yùdà sold 2,300 dan, Yuándà 1,800 dan, Lìchāng 3,500 dan, Tiānchāng 2,600 dan, Dàchāngchéng 2,200 dan, Yìchéng 2,200 dan, Lónghú, Méijì, Héngdà, Héngchāng, Xīnhuá, Shēnxīn, Yǒngfēng, Déjì, and Héshèn sold 1,000 to 1,200 dan each. Màojì bought 1,600 dan, Gōngtài 1,200 dan, Tàixīng 2,200 dan, Guǎngfēng 2,400 dan, Yǒngchāng 2,700 dan, and Dájì, Yìyú, Xiéshēng, and Tàichāng bought 900 to 1,400 dan each. The closing prices of Hankou Marked Yarn are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hankou Marked Yarn Closing Prices: Increase/Decrease - Balance</p>
<p>November: 34.00 - Rise 0.01 - 596,000</p>
<p>August: 34.90 - Rise 0.02 - 582,700</p>

<p>October: 34.10 - 088,800</p>
<p>January: 34.05 - 064,600</p>
<p>The path for spot cotton is blocked, and there is absolutely no spot cotton business. Various factories see excellent production of new cotton from various routes, and new Hankou cotton may also appear on the market soon. Few inquire about it. The source estimates Yao cotton at 888 bales. The sales list is on the left: Yao cotton is sold at 34.00 to 34.2, and customer syndicates took in 600 pieces for bonded warehouse delivery.</p>

<h3>World Cotton Market Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Has Reached the Lowest Record of the 1926 Bumper Harvest</p>
<p>New York, 15th Telegraph Report on the cotton market during the week: The impact of the drought on the Central and Western cotton belts is minimal. The cotton market is weak again. The government's estimated report, coupled with the carryover of old cotton, is sufficient to indicate the abundance of supply. Therefore, the market price of the cotton exchange has gradually fallen this week. A portion of the drought-stricken area has received torrential rain, enough to benefit the raw cotton, but most of it has not been rescued. It is reported that the cooperative association has set the basis for lending debts at 75% of the current price, and the Cotton Maintenance Association has purchased 800,000 bales and will purchase another 1.3 million bales from the previous season's surplus. After the purchases, they will all be stockpiled by the cooperative association. Currently, cotton mills are purchasing thinly for their future needs. Cotton prices have reached the lowest record of the 1926 bumper harvest, but whether the market can absorb the autumn hedging price at 12.25 cents or higher remains to be seen. The weekend statistics are attached on the left (unit: thousand bales).</p>

<h3>Rice Market Slightly Turns Firm</h3>
<p>The shipment of source number ten rice from Zhabei yesterday went well on the market. Premium white glutinous rice is 21 yuan, and Zhongguan has added one or two jiao. Currently, there is no distinction between the top two grades. Although there is supervision from the authorities, its effectiveness is still equal to nothing. The arrival of early rice is scarce, and the price is also 21 yuan. The arrival of Dongxin glutinous rice is slightly connected, and the price is still opened at 19 yuan and 5 jiao. The general trend is stable. Newly arrived Xian rice suddenly has premium goods, so the price is opened at 15 yuan and a half, but ordinary ones are 15 yuan. This goods seems soft. The yuan market continues to tighten. The actual reason is that the arrival is small and the inventory is dry. Large traders have raised jiao again. Ordinary opening price is high at 19 yuan, 4 jiao and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Eight or nine ships arrived at the South Shanghai River, and sales are still acceptable. Regular syndicate white glutinous rice is dwindling. The market is similar to the north, and only a few transactions are taking place. Su Tong white glutinous rice has slightly arrived in Shanghai, but demand is not very refreshing, so the price temporarily holds the original plate. Three or four of the southern syndicate's early rice have arrived, and the intention of this street is not weak. The price is firm. The yuan changes from tight to flat. There are few arrivals and sales are weak. Prices have no ups and downs. The whole day, all stalls uniformly present a firm trend.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Sales Are Active, and Prices Are Flat</h3>
<p>Foreign Unpolished Rice Is Sold Out</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market conditions were that mid-grade goods were sold by inland areas, local streets, and loose syndicates, and the market was flat and fair. High-grade goods were sold in a sluggish manner and continued to be soft. Number One Saigon was slightly tired, and then the Dalian Syndicate handled 200 bags. The local street also followed suit, and the market was able to turn steady. The appetite of the inland syndicates is still good, but the eating price is very tight, so the prices of all the Zhongguan rice they handled were flat. The unified market opened 1,000 bags of Number One Saigon at a price of 16 yuan, 6 jiao and a half to 4 jiao and a half. Number Two 1,000 bags 15 yuan, 2 jiao. Small Twist 500 bags at a price of 15 yuan, 4 jiao. Large Twist 1,000 bags, high 14 yuan, 2 jiao. Ordinary 13 yuan, 2 jiao. Min Dang 1,000 bags, priced at 15 yuan, 2 jiao and 3 jiao. Ke Gan rice 200 bags, priced at 15 yuan and 0.05 yuan. Since foreign unpolished rice was smoothly handled by the local inland streets, the number of arrivals gradually increased. The market situation suddenly rose and fell, with ups and downs of one yuan in one day. After that, because the source was cut off and the appetite in the inland area was strong, the price gradually improved. As of yesterday, all kinds of foreign unpolished rice have been sold out.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market Has Reached a Stalemate</h3>
<p>It Is Difficult for Both Bulls and Bears to Take Action</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw another stand-up. Foreign wheat quotations were also good by five or six jiao, which made people inside and outside the industry feel tight. Looking at the current market situation, it seems to have reached a stalemate. Because actual sales are not smooth and wheat has not been cheap, most of the transactions have been shelved. And the minds between factories are not consistent. Those who are bearish use the sluggish actual sales and are unwilling to cover their shorts. Those who are bullish rely on the high price of wheat and still take advantage of the opportunity to absorb. Both sides are competing with strength. The market has few avenues to find. However, in terms of the situation, if the sales market is active in the future, there is a possibility of a rapid rise and a slight fall. As a result, eighty-two in January are up seven li and a half from the previous day, September is up two and a half li, October is unchanged, and November is up one fen.</p>
<h3>The Wheat Market is Lively in the Near Term and Settled in the Long Term</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market turned to a firm trend. Foreign wheat quotations were also good. Generally, short sellers had to cover their shorts again. Since the current month will soon be delivered, customers without spot goods had to cover their shorts at any time. There were also several rounds of good profits in the long term, but later, because bulls in the inland areas returned, they were firm and settled again. As a result, the current month rose by four fen from the previous day, September rose by two fen, November rose by one fen, and December and January rose by two fen. Only Huofeng handled more than 4,000 bags of spot goods, and the rest were rejected, so the prices quoted by the stalls seemed to be one or two and two fen shorter. A total of more than 4,000 bags of Taierzhuang, Yaowan, Xinyangzhou, and Hankou wheat were opened.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Factory Sales to Europe and the United States Have Both Decreased</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firms silk market in the local area was even more difficult to progress. The New York telegram reported that the demand for green, yellow, and white factory silk was thin, and the French demand was also clear. All manufacturers also have low intentions to sell because of a shortage of raw materials. Yesterday, there were only slight short covering transactions. It is estimated that Ganli and others imported 60 bags of Shanghai white factory silk, and Xinfu imported 20 bags of Sichuan yellow factory silk. The prices were all firm.</p>
<h3>New York Raw Silk Prices Changed from Firm to Weak</h3>
<p>Imports are Prosperous, Factory Sales are Weak, and Prices Fall by About One Jiao</p>
<p>Since the silk weaving factories in the New York market started work after the summer vacation, silk sales have progressed quite well. However, drought has occurred in various parts of the United States, and raw silk factories have slowed down imports. Yokohama's raw silk inventories are abundant and actively exported. Imports are prosperous, and raw silk prices have turned weak. On Friday, the opening price of A-grade Japanese silk fell by 8 cents, B-grade fell by 1 jiao, and C-grade fell by 1 jiao and 4 fen.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants Lower Prices to Seek Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, green teas such as Zhenmei, Zhenmei, Fengmei, and Xiumei, etc., from the incoming road villages, continued to have sporadic intake from British and French villages, but the market has been sluggish for a long time, and the stocks are abundant. Chinese tea merchants are eager to sell, and they reluctantly lower prices for the market price and sell them off. The goods opened on the market yesterday fell another two or three taels, and there were no transactions for Gongxi green tea throughout the city. Black teas from the Qining and other routes were also not inquired about.</p>

<h3>Shanghai South</h3>
<p>Recently, boats arriving in Shanghai South from the Huangpu River have become increasingly rare. Those that do arrive are only from the Jiaoli Gang and Tongli Gang. However, sales are slightly improved. The remaining goods from Yangjian, referring to the triangular area, are similar to the original prices. Jiaoli late rice is 2100, and the best early rice is 2050. Regular grades vary from 1910 to 1880. Chefang white glutinous rice is 1900, Tongli white glutinous rice is 1850, and Zhongguan goods are 1800. Northern Di Yangjian is 1700.</p>
<h3>Zhabei</h3>
<p>Yesterday, five boats arrived from the river. Although the price of high-quality white glutinous rice on the market has not exceeded the limit, the arrival of Zhongguan white glutinous rice is scarce, and the price has increased by one yuan within a few days. Other varieties are also seeing upward movement, and there are instances of pushing prices up. Yesterday, the price of fresh goods on the market rose sharply, while the prices of other goods remained firm. White Glutinous Rice</p>

<h3>Anthology of Ballads</h3>
<p>— Zeng Yang</p>
<p>Edited by Zhong Jingwen</p>
<p>In China, where folk literature is usually overlooked, it is truly a surprising and noteworthy event that such a collection of essays specifically studying ballads could emerge from the chaotic publishing world not long ago. One must understand that, among the most precious of folk literatures, besides the stories passed down, the folk ballads that originated in ancient times naturally hold an important place. The poetry created by scholars in modern times is actually influenced by ancient ballads, which is undeniable. Even Western poetry originates from the prototype of ancient literature – folk songs and dances. This was a form of entertainment for ancient people during gatherings, celebrations, or when invoking deities, encompassing three elements: language, music, and movement. With the development of these three elements, what we call modern literature, especially poetry, which occupies an important position, was formed. Thus, if poetry is the most typical art form in literature, then the value of folk ballads, which express the most simple and sincere emotions, can be understood.</p>
<p>Originally, folk ballads contain beautiful elements expressed through language. In the primitive era, before the invention of writing, these beautiful emotions were passed down orally among ordinary people. Because they are full of vibrant life and possess truly immortal value, they have been preserved to this day. In these great ancient folk songs, one can clearly see some that marvel at the greatness of nature, some that praise the magnificence of deities, some that recount the legacy of battles, some that sing of the beauty of young men and women, some that lament the oppression of women, some that expose the power and oppression of the aristocracy, and some that express national character. These are all demands of beautiful emotions, which are of course very clear. However, regarding the various expressions of the folk songs mentioned above, many people who love folklore have collected them. Occasionally, one or two books of these ballads, such as Wu songs or Cantonese ballads, can be found in bookstores, which is certainly a good phenomenon. However, as far as I know, this collection of ballads is the first of its kind, being a meticulously researched scholarly work on ballads. With such rich and perfect content, it truly deserves our careful introduction to readers.</p>
<p>Each essay collected here is the result of the hard work of scholars specializing in folk literature and can be said to be a compilation of the achievements of various folklore experts. Its value cannot be fully described by ordinary words. According to the editor himself in the preface, the articles of discussion and investigation included here were first published in the "Ballad Weekly" published by the Ballad Research Society of Peking University. The weekly was published intermittently for two years, totaling ninety-six issues, and was eventually discontinued because it was to be changed into the "National Studies Weekly." In the ninety-six issues of the weekly, in addition to more than two or three thousand ballads, there were about one or two hundred articles on this subject. Such dedicated research and the achievement of such a magnificent result truly deserve our utmost admiration. However, due to financial constraints, each issue of the journal was only printed in five hundred copies and distributed as an attachment to the Peking University Daily, so very few copies circulated outside. Even the scholars who were most actively involved in this movement had very few copies in their possession, and there were no complete articles. This is indeed a great regret. Now, fortunately, Mr. Zhong has sacrificed much of his energy, managing to find some time in his busy schedule to select dozens of articles and compile them into this thick collection, so that those who have not seen the "Ballad Weekly" can feast their eyes and make up for what they consider a regrettable deficiency. This indeed has great significance, and Mr. Zhong's enthusiasm for the research and promotion of folk literature makes us admire him even more.</p>
<p>The editor has divided these articles into three categories: the first series is research and discussion, the second series is descriptions of ballads from various regions, and the third series is book reviews and prefaces. Because the classification of articles is a very difficult task, although the editor humbly believes that he has only roughly divided them, it has made it much easier for us to search through them, and we do not find any significant discrepancies.</p>
<p>In reality, every article here is a precious jewel, and most of the authors are people who have explored or are passionate about this field. For example, Jia Bai's arguments on the artistic value of nursery rhymes are exceptionally insightful, and his views are sharp, concise, and comprehensive.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, no country in the world has been without its own unique folk songs and nursery rhymes. After all, a country's music develops based on nursery rhymes and folk songs, which expresses the characteristics of each country's music. Nursery rhymes and folk songs can be said to be the original elements for creating and expressing national music. The production of folk songs and nursery rhymes is generally not the work of a single musician, nor is it created by anyone at any time. It is only after many people have appropriately revised them and with the approval of ten thousand people that they can be passed down through the generations, which is a genuine expression of national character. Only in this way can they reflect the times. If there is nothing but national character in folk songs, then they cannot be considered to have any value. The same is true of nursery rhymes, but in terms of lyrics, folk songs are mostly sung by adults, while nursery rhymes are suitable for children's lives. This is the difference between the two.</p>
<p>From the passage quoted above, we can see that the author's research is meticulous, and when discussing the artistic value of nursery rhymes, he first details the point that one must study folk songs, because nursery rhymes and folk songs cannot be absolutely separated, and it is difficult to strictly define the two areas in scholarship. There is not much difference between the two in terms of their form and structure. In this difficulty of division, the author has actually elaborated on the formation and relationship between the two based on his own research experience. That is to say, when discussing nursery rhymes, one must inevitably involve folk songs. Similarly, the author also starts with the point that the actual purpose of studying nursery rhymes is to promote a country's national character. This argument, which is rich in national consciousness, makes us want to applaud and praise it even more.</p>
<p>Next, we must mention Wang Zhaoding's essay "How to Research and Organize Ballads," which is truly of great value. In it, the nature of ballads is appropriately divided into four sections: 1. Ballads are genuine and natural folk literature; 2. Ballads are the crystallization of a nation's thought; 3. Ballads have no fixed records; 4. Ballads have no fixed author. At the same time, the author divides the knowledge that should be possessed before studying the ballads of a place into three sections, giving full play to them: 1. Regarding geographical aspects; 2. Regarding humanistic aspects; 3. Regarding social aspects. Especially this third section, the argument is very precise and is truly a commendable work of deep thought.</p>
<p>The social phenomena that produce ballads have the greatest impact. We all know that the production of ballads is based on the commonality of the nation, with external stimuli as the engine. Then what is external stimuli? Is it not current social phenomena? Going a step further, commonality is caused by the natural environment and terrain, and stimuli are caused by the artificial environment and social phenomena. If you want to trace the source, you should not be biased in any way. Therefore, in order to thoroughly study ballads, you have to carefully examine the social phenomena in which they are situated. In the process of examining social phenomena, I think it should be divided into two parts, one is the past and the other is the present. Both parts contain politics, education, customs, and morality, but you should combine the past and the present into a systematic examination.</p>
<p>Because social phenomena are the starting point or birth point of ballads, the passage above is indeed very important. It provides a great deal of help to those who are studying ballads for the first time and is a very detailed reference material. Moreover, the author also provides deep guidance on how to research and organize them at the end. This is a central issue that should be given extra attention. First is the explanation of words and phrases, in which dialect occupies the most important position. Second is to discover the true meaning, in which national character can give us twelve points of assistance. After the words and phrases are understood and the true meaning is discovered, the third step is classification. The author's criteria for classification are extremely precise, determined from various aspects such as politics, history, education, customs, entertainment, expression, and other aspects, to determine the national character of this place, the past spiritual achievements, and the current spiritual situation. He also describes what methods we should use to transform, enlighten, guide, and support them. From the political and educational aspects, we can understand what they hate and what they like, what their strengths and weaknesses are, giving those who govern and educate the people of this place an excellent reference. It is easy to guide the source and flow, and it will be easy to make achievements. Therefore, the result of the author's ideal research and organization of ballads is that he has precisely distinguished and stated the characteristics of various ethnic groups in China from the above classification, which is much more detailed than the general folklore ballad classifications in the past. He also earnestly argues that ballads have a very close relationship with society and the country. Only those who have a deep understanding of ballads can do this work. Our author, Mr. Wang, has actually done it.</p>
<p>Chang Hui's translation of the preface to Beijing's ballads is also an important piece of writing. At the beginning of the article, the author clearly points out the benefits that he firmly believes readers can gain from this book: first, to obtain texts or phrases that are not easily seen elsewhere; second, to understand the details of the daily life of the Chinese people; third, to realize that true poetry can be found in the songs of the Chinese common people. From this, we can also see the importance of studying ballads. Moreover, these ballads are simple and moving. For those who have only a little knowledge of the joys and sorrows of the Chinese people, they can be regarded as authors of poetry. The author once said, "I would also like to draw the reader's attention to the poetic methods used in these ballads, because they are made by the illiterate who do not understand classical Chinese, revealing a poetic method similar to that of European countries, almost completely in line with Italian poetry. Based on this kind of ballad and national sentiment, a new kind of national poetry may arise." The author's great hope relies on the efforts of current scholars of folklore. Especially in China, where the Chinese people are like a sheet of loose sand, otherwise this hope will not be realized.</p>
<p>This collection includes a total of thirty research and discussion articles, each of which is a magnificent work, such as Zhou Zuoren's "The Value of Chinese Folk Songs," Zhong Jingwen's "A Method of Expression of Ballads," Huang Pu's "Ballads and Politics," Yang Shiqing's "Looking at the Status of Chinese Women from Ballads," Liu Dajiu's "Experience Gained from Collecting Ballads and Introduction to Buddhist Gathas," and Jia Bin's translation of "The Movement to Collect Ballads in England." Each article is worth reading carefully again and again. There are six descriptions of ballads from various regions and five book reviews and prefaces. Some introductions to overseas folk songs are particularly valuable, allowing us to know the common points between foreign folk songs and Chinese folk songs, and also allowing us to understand the national character and customs of other countries, etc., which deserve our attention.</p>
<p>Among them, many rare love songs are also quoted. After readers have read these seemingly boring essays, they can read these beautiful love songs again, and they will feel refreshed. In short, every text collected here is a precious jewel, the crystallization of the hard work of each author. For this great anthology of ballads, it is hoped that readers, especially those who love folk literature, will not overlook it.</p>

<h3>Modern Fixtures in Houses</h3>
<p>Some people believe that the great freedom of people under government in a great country can be transformed into an environment of human sentiment. If effort is put into every aspect, it will naturally lead to a life free from worries about food and clothing. Therefore, labor on a grand scale is a great revolution. Since 1919, labor has been carried out. Some consider it too large, while others consider it too small, but it has already attracted the attention of the world. In 1925, a world labor exhibition was held. With that, a new era has been established. Among the styles, there are Spanish styles and styles of Louis XIV, each with its own characteristics. The advantage lies in paying attention to the light. The gathering of society and culture leads to a transformation of life, which is very beneficial to the spirit. This kind of labor entered Shanghai from the French Concession in 1923. Now, industrial banks, hotels, and dance halls have taken the lead in adopting it publicly or partially. It has already become a trend. Among Chinese who study this kind of industrial art, those who have studied in France are the majority. The gatherings and events are organized by individuals such as Mr. and Ms. Jiang Xiaozan. The reader can see from the following examples the interior of the aforementioned buildings.</p>
