<p>世界之貨物過多則增加他國之貨稅以自行保護此第一步各國自行救濟之方法亦即第一步無可如何之方策也他國對之無可如何則亦擇其國之貨物銷行之多者增加其稅以爲報復於是各國問之銷貨愈難而貨物之　餘愈多商業日形衰落而竸爭乃益加烈雖日求和平親善之策乃以利害切身之故遂不得不交相爲惡矣。</p>
<p>我嘗言之人生最不可少之貨物於衣食住行之中以衣爲最有關係衣之貨物爲棉類故印日間增稅與反對增稅之風雲以起此乃世界最後一步經濟竸爭之開始。自後將逐漸而至肉搏也。</p>

<p>（再）（續）</p>
<p>無担保品之内外債政府年來雖值軍　旁午、</p>
<p>日不睱給之際、但爲維持國家信用計、會派行政院長財政及關係各部長曁重要人員、组織特别委員會、研究討論清償無担保品内外債方案、結果已有顯著之進步、本年大致可定確切辦法、其初步擬由政府年撥五百萬元、爲將案清理之凖備、</p>
<p>國中時有人提議、財部欲得經濟上之援助、應設法借貸外債、然財部政策、必須外債條件相當、並無傷於國家經濟主權、方可接受、舍此則絶對不予接洽、一年來財部對於内外債問題、已將由部負責之債務通盤籌畫、擬定一妥善清償之辦法、務使一方對於國權無損、一方對於一般債權人均能愜意、</p>
<p>同時財部切盼政府各機關予以充分之諒解及認識、夫恢復國家信用、煞費周章、事非易舉、端资羣力、尤願無論何方、勿以貿然舉債爲無足重輕之事、要知政府局部失信、即足影響全體、各國對我之信譽、亦有相當之損失、换言之、國家之信用、與政府整個實胡關連、牽一髮即可動全身也、</p>
<p>公債庫劵　年來政府爲統一用兵、及實施編遣遂不得不一再發行公債庫劵、卒以事與願違、所期編遣之目的、每難達到、惟所發行之債劵、係以極可靠之收入指充担保、同時明令召集各銀行各團體代表组織基金保管委員會、因此債劵遂成爲一大市面、除銀行外、即普通人民買賣債劵、亦甚踴躍、一方面固由商業不動、資金過剩、一方面亦可證明政府債劵之價值、足使一般人民信仰也、</p>
<p>長此發行債劵、用以應軍政之急需、實爲權宜之辦法、决非理財之正道、財政當局知之最審、惟以和平未能恢復、通盤之政策無從施行、因應付目前之環境、不得已而出此、是根本上仍須和平實現、方有整理之可能也、</p>
<p>中央銀行本黨在廣東漢口先後創辦中央銀行、備歷艱難、但並不因此灰阻、组織此行之政策、亦始終未經變更、惟在北伐未成功前、若率行濫發纸幣、以充軍用、前途金融危險、何堪設想、故對於中央銀行之設立、遲廻未果、迨北伐完成、始於十七年十一月一日成立、同時即經财部規定章制、對於業務之管理、格外嚴密、對於纸幣之舉行、尤格外審　、並由政府及各公共團體　　理事會監事會、共同努力、處理行務、用昭大信、因此成立年餘、雖屢經政治上軍事上種種震據、尚能平稳渡過、一年來之發展、不無可觀、若時局承平、其前途殊難限量也、</p>
<p>中央銀行成立後、凡百持以妥愼、政府財政上之信用、亦賴以無形增高、且每遇時局緊張、利率騰漲時、即以警欵用較低利率、貸予同業、市面以　平靜、</p>
<p>内債基金、向存外國銀行、現已改存中央銀行、如大局平定、政府各項大計實施、中央銀行以地位之關係、當可爲整理金融维持市面之中心機關、茲將該行成立一年後之资産負債總表、附列於後、（附表從略）</p>
<p>專家委員會財部在近兩年間、延聘多數專家委員、計設財政改良、十七年夏召集經濟會議以徵求全國銀行家商業家對於經濟建設之意見鹽務烟酒、亦各延派委員、集會研究改良、其最著要者、要爲設計委員會、該委員會爲財部所延聘美國經濟財政專家所组織、主任委員爲凱末爾博士、凱氏學問經騐、均極豐富、該委員會責任、爲研究國内幣財政各大方案、犖犖大者如改良幣制、整理稅收、及全國收支預算、會計管理、及恢復國信方法、其所得結果、均已編成各種報告書、預備提出國務會議、其中有關於民生國計問題、爲民衆所應注意者、將來亦擬刊行流傅、凱末爾博士任務已畢、業經返國、惟尚有委員會專家委員數人、仍行繼續延聘、以資集思廣益之助、</p>
<p>職員考試制財部用人、與政府各機關相同、因當北伐軍事時代、事實與需要上之關係、急不睱擇、惟有就現有人員量才器使、欲確有行政經騐人才、實不多觏、現當考試院成立、當有完善之方法改良登進之制度、</p>
<p>文官考試制、目前尚未實行、但財部仍保持部屬各機關原有之考試規程、例如海關服務人員向須經過考試此種良好制度殊有维持價值、因有此制度及秩序、故現定辦法、不僅屬於海關、即内地常關如蕪湖揚由鳳陽等、現亦歸併海關辦理、以期仿行此制</p>
<p>鹽務稽核所亦操同樣之政策、在財部恢復各地稽核所之最要理由亦因該所具有優良之考試制所中人員、均有經騐及訓練之故、財部所轄稅收機關、以捲烟稅處爲第三重要現雖未盡適用考試制、但一部分人員之任免遷擢、亦已仿效考試制、將來處長人選或有更動、處員確可不聯帶更動、</p>
<p>釐金收入、年額在七千萬元之巨、名雖國稅、其辦理人員率由各地當局派充、局卡林立、徵收方法旣極煩苛、人員品類尤極龐雜、弊端百出、勢所必然此種機關殊無根本改良辦法、雖有良好之考試制亦屬無補、惟有毅然决然於預定時期澈底裁廢而已</p>
<p>釐金裁撤後、關鹽捲烟稅收、佔本部十分之九、其考試制大部分旣經採用、則財部所屬一切機關、將來普遍採用考試制度、應非難事、惟海關及　核所人員之薪給比較各機關爲　故待遇標準問題、稍有困難耳、</p>
<p>養成一般人員廉潔的操守、與良　的風氣非厲行考試制及保障法不爲功、蓋此制實爲解决用人惟一之根本方法也、</p>
<p>預算國内雖值軍事匪患饑荒諸端、層見迭出、銀價跌落、金融恐慌之際、然財政問題、並非絶對無法解决、祇在時局稍見和平、預算能使確立、用途不至如前之散漫無稽、施政不至如前之急不睱擇則財政前途始可有望、</p>
<p>本黨早認預算之需要、以預算確立、政府工作、始可有一定之範圍及步驟、預算公開亦可得一般民衆之信仰、是以主張於最短期間成立預算、財部當每次中執委開全會時及開經濟會議財政會議裁兵會議編遣會議時、亦每請政府對此問題特别注意施行、因政府而無預算、必至東來西去、左支右絀、澈底之財政計劃、無可實行、政府僅有徵收稅項之權能、而無公開收支之報告、實爲政府與人民合作上一大阻礙、</p>
<p>成立預算最大之困難、爲不能預知軍費之需要及限制、政府亦屢次竭力主張、减少軍費至最低限度例如十八年二月第一次編遣會議時、各方重要將領見政府收支總表、因一致議决軍費預算除編遣費外、每年限定一萬九千二百萬元、詎桂馮軍閥相繼倡亂議案遂同虚設、迨桂馮次第解决、政府復以整理之機又至續開編遣會議、略將軍費提高、定爲每年二萬一千六百萬元、男加編遣費三千萬元、但不旋踵問内亂又復頻作、致政府不得不用盡方法、籌供軍實重渡東挪西凑之難關矣、</p>
<p>表中所列軍費、自十七年七月至十八年六月、共數爲二萬零九百五十三萬六千九百六十九元、但此數並非全國之軍費總數、所有東三省熱察綏泰隴晋川滇黔粤桂所支、尚不在内、（以上諸省軍費、間有非法强制借欵、預徵錢糧捐稅、用以應付者）若併此數省合計、則超過兩次編遣會議所定之數、尚不知凡幾、</p>
<p>究竟吾國軍費應如何限制、俾財部不致日事羅掘又如何得使財部得有餘力、以顧建設事業、及償還内外債務、此中關鍵、實在全國和平一問題、决非財部本身所能爲力苟此問題得有圓满解决、則將來之憲政實施、經濟建設、國際地位及財政整理各問題、必可迎刄而解、自非黨國人民眞切合作、共濟艱難、不能爲功也、（完）</p>

<p>國民社云、三月六日、字林西報登載、安徽鴉片情形、以及九日登載遠東調查團意見、國内人士一大部份、非常注意、去年在國際聯盟禁烟委員會奮鬥之王公使景岐、現適在滬、記者因特趨訪詢問、前後實在情形、據王公使公、遠東調查團稱、當初國際聯盟會、不能承受中國代表團提案理由、第一點、是因中國要求派員參加調查團、聯盟會不能照辦、因爲若許中國參加、則　鴉片關係之各國、亦不同樣要求參加、第二點因爲中國要求同時調查嗎啡、此層應由國際聯盟新設之中央監察部辦理、所以不能允許云云、此兩點於事實上不無多少出入、第一點、當初國際聯盟行政院開會時、我固曾提出中國人參加調查團之議、隨後會中意思、要無鴉片　係國籍民從事調查、當時我方聲稱、倘調查團能擴充調查的區域與物品的範圍、本代表可向中國政府建議、取消中國人參加之議、第二點、中央監察部、當時尚未成立、即使已經成立、該部係根據日來復一九二五年公約第七章第十九欵所産生的、我們受外來毒物最深之中國·以及美國、并未曾簽字、而且調查嗎啡、與該約付予監察部之職務、井無衡突也、井不重復、譬如該團現在專門調查鴉片、與按照公約二十三欵付與監察部搜羅鴉片的統計之職務、也并無衝突、或是重復、所以根據這種理由、就放棄嗎啡而不調查、中國人實在不能满意、當初他們反對我們、只提說、是因爲費錢太多、經濟有問題、所以我十月十五日、在杭州與國民通訊社談話時、曾說『經費不能成爲問題、因製造毒品、亦多在歐洲、交通便利、朝發夕至、不至破費多數金錢、歐洲以外製造毒品者爲日本、今遠東調查團旣到遠東、若就會中所定範圍而調查日本之烟苗、似乎明知日本不産烟苗、而姑作一種形式上觀察、至於日本出産多量毒品之情形、反置不問、實使中國熱心拒毒人士、百思不得其解、』但是我們盼望大家、明瞭中國人於原則上、與國際聯盟、實是相符、惟辦法上不同而已、好在一年以來、各方愈瞭然於嗎啡各品之害、限制辦法、不日草定、這是很可喜歡的至於案徽字林西報訪員謂中國代表在日來復禁烟會席上說了許多遮掩面子的話眞不值　者一笑云云這種譏誚的話語出、於在中國之外報訪員、使我們聽見實在惋惜得很我們中國、在國際禁烟會的代表有兩重立塲一是國内的一是國際的他本人也知道、國内因内爭的種種關係到了如今烟禍尚未肅清抱無限之悲憤所以對國内也說過了無數苦口的意見了、可是無論烟禍如何也不過中國人害中國自已而已我們並未殘殺他國的人、我們應該自已去幹Feran</p>
<p>dese是在國際上、中國受了外來毒物的害、是有憑有據的、中國代表、當然不能不起來反對嗎啡溢量的製造我所以從前說過『國内如不能用　密誠懇之手段立行禁烟則吾人祇覺對不住自已再不能怨恨他人此乃中國自已一方面之事另一方面說法外人如不限制毒品工廠不遵守海牙公約在中國又尚依賴不平等條約之勢力以毒品遺害我海内海外之人民則是外人對不住中國人處則亦不能怪今日之中國人民及明日之中國人民永遠痛心疾首』中國之外交官愛國愛眞理愛公道之心並不下於任何國之人、無論何國人、在禁烟會内、若居中國之代表地位不能再有第二個態度從前時代往往中國新的外交官要　保護中國主權的時候他個人不受外人種種攻擊、想不到今日中國禁烟委員會代表所持的態度、又有旅華外人的挪　直接的損害個人尊嚴間接的損害他所代表的國家的威信但是中國代表所持的態度若是能引起世界覺悟外來毒物有害於我中國、有害於我亞西亞民族如此地步、我們自已也是非常榮幸的以上所說係我個人意見但是我想中國政府與全國人民看法也不致相岐</p>

<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>自來文明各國對於毒物之運輸交易。靡不出其全力以禁止之。然而禁止之法彌嚴。而偷漏者日窮其巧思。發明種種偷漏之方法。毒物之運輸也乃日盛。嘗差聞人言。文明日甚。佞巧之徒亦日多。而犯法之事亦益衆。洵哉。偷漏之法。有用夾板之箱。埋藏毒物於夾層内。以逃海關稽查者之目者。然而此法行之旣久。秘密公開。法無可施。於是有利用馬驢犬畜先飼以鋁質包裹之毒物再運之之目的地剖其腹而取其毒者。然而法雖巧矣。馬驢犬畜經一次之利用。即須喪其性命。手續旣煩。得利不厚。美國繁華之邦。雖曾有上項事件之發見。然竟未多見於他國。吾國海關口岸則另有别種巧妙之方法。利用獸畜之事。更無聞矣。最近在某西報上見有一驚人之消息。則在美國竟有用白鴿以輸送毒物者矣。鴿飛天空。高入雲際。速率旣大。擊射爲難。爲利一也。鴿識舊家。去而能還。不費人力。不虞走失。爲利二也。飛翔天際。不致爲國家稽查者所見。爲利三也。一次輸送。無害於鴿。且愈用愈精。可至無盡數次。直至鴿老而死爲止。爲利四也。有此四利。聰明之美利堅人。於是羣起倣效。國家禁毒雖嚴。稽查雖密。然亦無之如何也。然則輸運之法又如何。則先將鴿自舊家遷之新地。以預以鋁製之小罐。藏毒物如馬非雅片海洛英等於其中。繫於鴿之兩足。縱之使遁。鴿識舊家。翱翔而還。據調查所得。每次每鴿所携之毒物。依時價計算。可自五元（美金）至十元之譜。善飛之鴿。能飛千里。每次所携。則以路途之遠近。鴿之能力高下。以爲判。此種秘法。行之已久。其最初爲政府所發見者。則爲SanAntonio</p>
<p>一鴿商所報告。緣該鴿商。曾賣數十對白　鴿於某人。未及二月。忽有飛還至該鴿商家者。察視之下。見其雙足均繫有小鋁罐部而視之。則赫然Cocaine也。（注——一種毒藥價極貫。爲美國政府所禁止賣買者）鴿商異之遂以報告於警署。此事之洩漏。大致爲買鴿之人。携回飼養。使識其新巢。便其利用。二月之後。成績極佳。乃以上法使之運毒物。不意其中有數老鴿。不服新巢。猶憶舊主。仍復飛回也。今則美國政府中人。日從事於討論此項問題。聞已着手調查各地鴿商。命其記錄買鴿人之住址名。以便詳查。然而至今運毒之人。多自養鴿。因鴿之飼養易而生殖蕃。且生長於一處。不致中途迷失。爲人破獲也。政府中人。亦徒嘆技窮而已。噫思亦巧矣。爰濡筆記之。用懲奸佞。</p>

<p>夜讀希拉史。因思希化長于細奴自由。然因缺政治統一。雖能抗波斯。终爲大羅馬所呑食。此偏于小之弊也。元朝能统一亞歐非三洲。而不能持久。此偏于大之弊也。今英美殖民。旣有大有細。所以凌厲萬國矣。而我三代王制及周初地官分民任職之法。亦有大細。漢後　　徒有大而無細。成一老大徒傷悲之民族。眞可哀矣。幸近民族主義經孫先生倡起。再須大倡自治團。實現地方自治。開始實行法。則得矣。但行易知難。知者少。究竟行之無效力。若求其知。則周官分民孟子制産之制度精神。與今職工聯合會之法。與希拉人自治自由之文化。非精研不可。思至此。我欲编一希拉自治文化與齊魯。惜無睱耳。試略述其義。</p>
<p>西方文化之父爲希拉。希小國十數而有兩小市府。國家代一爲雅典。一爲斯巴逹。斯巴逹尚武。似乎齊。雅典尚文。似乎魯。其結果斯巴逹戰勝波斯九十餘萬大軍。猶齊之覇中國。攘夷狄　典文弱而出三哲索格拉底拍拉圖及亞理斯多德。猶魯之有孔孟矣。武功宜於一時。文化傅於　　後世。中國三代文化制度。齊魯爲代表。西國傅於今之文化制度。雅度斯巴逹爲其父母。中國之管子孟子周宫亦我民族政敎自治之命脈矣。但若不研希拉。此精神無從比較。而出。故余欲編希　　拉自治文化與齊魯一書。爲普通自治課本。而今若在僑民爲尤急矣。世有能通希拉文明者。其代我爲之。所甚盼也。</p>

<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>野獸羣Fauve（下）</p>
<p>在一九○六年前後。因瑪諦斯Matisse勒拉格　Braque梵鈍根　VanDongen</p>
<p>佛拉孟克Vlaminck度翡　Dufy傅力士　Friesz等的刺激。産生了野獸主義　Faurismeo這是對學院派的陳腐以及印象派新印象所起的以規律爲本的反動。那備受嘲笑慣的『野獸羣』的人們。如同後來立體派一樣。很明白地　　　　看透新印象派的科學化不惟技術上顯得侷促。而且在美術的趣味上也暴露其貧　　乏的弱點。這種缺少高超和深味的新印象派。很顯然走到裝飾的時髦和純粹學院主義一樣討厭的新學院主義上面去。因此『野獸羣』感到了有開闢一個比較高超的理想之必要。他們傾向於自然的印象的傅統以外的東西。這種觀點是根據視官的混合的對象。就是從那已纂集已成就的對象來研究的。换言之。以前藝術家是看了自然的表面的形。而從其中描出所謂宏大。優美來作畫。『野獸羣』的人們　　　　就不同了。他們是要捉取在於自然的奥處或他們認爲在於自然的奥處的一種不可思議的情緒或情調。</p>
<p>『野獸羣』對於輕視個性而描寫自然的表面的形的畫是反對的。他們以爲性格和意想不應爲自然束縛。而當應用自然以激起本人的靈感。繪畫的目的不是要爲自然現象的敏銳的發明者。還有旁的奥妙的目的在。因爲專是那樣。將如雷南Renan批評歷史一樣。只變了一種可憐的臆度的小科學罷了。於是『野獸羣』的人　　　　們利用觀察的官能就更接近科學的分析的目上。這種觀察的官能是從印象主義遺傅下來的。他們聲言在特拉克窪Delacroix所介紹的『自然辭典』中。選擇了不消說是活的那種意欲。而且選擇了藉着色彩的最纎密的修積的能力。受了擴大的形式的某種概念力的轉變而來的意欲。以結構他們的作品。從這裏看來。他們要在他們的前輩的實行的獲得物中再擇求一個前輩們所没有發見的美術上的新獲得物之必要。所以他們時時顧慮到應該努力充實這種作風而使他們的作品足以超過正式被承認了的諸大師的作品之上。</p>
<p>總之『野獸羣』的畫家是要設法把塞尚Cezanue修刺　seurnt雷諾亞的敎訓實施在畫面上去。主張有一個『構造的』時代。將印象主義者的技術變爲一種美術。　　　　使其基礎建立於印象主義的傅統的新古典主義之的一種特新而特富的探求之上。</p>
<p>『野獸羣』的第一次試作是以歸返傅统而表現的。這所謂傅統。不是僅在字面。而在其精神。因爲一件作品。不能單以其外表而存在。尤在以其靈魂而永生。我們　　　　探訪一切博物館。我們就可以發現最富于新的研究和技術的原理。混辭時代的作品。如克雷托亞Cretois矣及。希臘。比讓汀　Byzantins的古代藝術。再有原始人。羅馬。摩西伊Mosatns的藝術。以至於黑人的藝術。都可以從中找出當時的特性。『野獸羣』傾向於體的新精神化。專心創造建築風的結構。訓練着節約着一切方法。而認這種方法可以把繪畫從它的原先的感覺性而截然地變爲快感性的了。至其所走的這路。乃藉着這構造的興味與缐條的分離。色彩的團塊的意胎而來的變形與再造形。末了從造型。深度。嚴謹。省約等價值的意義上而論。他們主　　張的是一種强而顯的『以少道多』的東西。而反對印象派的散辭。冗贅和重複　野獸主義之對於自然。棄其外形。而接受其精神。他們不攝影。却组織成一種由情緒張起的景色。它們不模倣自然的外形。却能奥妙地撥動世界窮的大諧和</p>

<p>（六）窠裏生活</p>
<p>海上勞燕有一個棲止的塲所、簡稱呌做『窠』、窠裏面的生活、很實得研究、有的說是神仙窟、有的說像活地獄不問他是窟還是獄、反正事實告訴我們兩者多有些相像、這種地方、在見慣的人看起來、原没有什麽希罕、提起『窠』字、就像提起『家』字一樣的平淡無奇、不過在另一方面看起來、這窠的賣買究竟是秘寗的、窠裏的生活、也免不掉帶神秘的色彩、總之窠裏所給我們的印象、就是都市間的一種病態罷了、</p>
<p>『窠』的名詞本不十分名譽、在三四十年前、他的父他的祖用『間』和『館』、來代表他們的賣買、那時候聲勢喧嚇、所謂逹官顯人、都和他結交、到了『窠　生手裏、一蹶不振、大非昔比、不但不能光大門楣、反而處處要受指摘和監視了、</p>
<p>沿街找不到窠、好像樹根裏不做鳥巢一樣、上窠免不掉登高、幾乎是一個定例、而且路途又必異常典折、高等的窠比較的道路平坦、中下等的間實是羊腸鳥道、曲經生幽、譬如一個弄堂裏的窠、照例從後門進出、一乘寛不過尺餘的扶梯、從地面上彎彎曲曲通到二樓三樓、進門的時候、大家伸手不見五指、走了四五層梯、纔有燈光從板壁裏漏走來、同時有呼呼作響的聲音、似臭非臭的氣味、送到你的耳朶裏鼻頭裏、因之初步進窠所碰到的、就有這光·聲·味·三件東西、</p>
<p>即使大家都是驀生而不相識的、在窠裏總是大家『互相的默契』在樓梯間上下、洞門裏出入、不一定互相用形色來表示、而自然之中自有一種『默契』的心理所以走在小梯上、個個人都是從容不迫、徐疾中節、尤其是從樓上走下來的人、一步一步都踏得着着實實、眼睛也不花了、四肢也有力了、看見下面有人上去、無論識與不識、他嘴裏常常叫下面的人『走好當心、』在哼氣·微嗽的中間、流露着十二分的同情心、一經到了窠裏、最不好踟蹰不前、或者探頭探腦、至於　蹌直前一鼓作勇的飛奔上去、那更外不合於『窠』的邏輯了、</p>
<p>窠中一瞥、最初的印象怎樣、大凡第一次進窠的人、首觸於眼廉的是一股繚繞的雲霧、中間浸着許多蠟人、仿佛纔走進澡堂子一樣、再向左右一望、又好像踏在人家的床舖上、四面八方的長腿短脚、直抵到自已身上來、其實這些床都叫做榻、打橫在榻上的、個個側轉了身體、在燈頭上做工夫、呑進去·吐出來·左邊一口、右邊兩口、越抽越有勁、黃豆樣的一盞燈上、將人間所有的煩惱、燒得乾乾凈凈、大概第一抽最有勁道、嘴不住的吸雙肩也陪着不住的住上聳、往後便漸漸的慢起來、最不忍看的一種欲罷不能的情狀、憔悴的臉、薄薄的唇、縮緊了嘴拚命的吸、結果是有氣無聲、可憐人比黃花瘦、</p>
<p>窠裏的陳設、都是簡捷了當、可省即省、除了壁上懸着的一只時鐘、結構最爲繁複以外、别的東西、了無足述、所以室中的空氣、分明是冷淡欲絶的、要不是榻上的先生們拚命呑吐其間、來造成一室濃厚而富有色彩的氣味、誰還願意留戀其間、不過在這晝夜不分、太陽光永遠照不進的仙窟裏、也常有『仙女』光降、造成了不少的香火因緣、她們橫在榻上、舒臂輕挑、脫手成珠、同樣的亨受一切、所麻煩的、事後未免要重施一次口脂罷了、</p>
<p>不夜城的中間、自有不夜的工作、『窠』是興奮的泉源、興奮之下所産生的、便上都市間的種種罪惡、因窠而發生連帶關係的就當推賭了、所以在窠一帶的範圍裏、常常有許多賭博的塲子、甚至於樓上是窠、樓下就有賭、客堂樓裏搖　、亭子間裏做窠、更不算希奇、所奇怪的、用筆寫在纸上就變了『新聞』哩、常年不收市的點心店、早夜做賣買的水果攤、都和窠有直接或者間接的關係、所不同的那接近窠的水菓攤出售的梨橘蘋果等類、似乎汁水少些、外形要乾枯些、或許是都市的生活程度一天高似一天、窠裏的朋友們受了生活的壓迫、就連帶影響到水菓攤上去哩、</p>

<p>He Yingqin and Others Sworn into Office</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Conferred the Seal, Hu Hanmin Witnessed the Oath</p>
<p>He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs of the Nanjing National Government, He Yaozu, Chief of Staff of the National Government, Li Shijia, Yang Qingzhen, Lin Xianxin, Tang Dexin, Xu Jixiang, Luo Xuhe, and other Department Directors of the Ministry of Navy held a swearing-in ceremony at the auditorium of the National Government at 10:00 AM on the 10th. Chiang Kai-shek, Tan Yankai, Hu Hanmin, Gu Yingfen, Chen Shaokuan, Yi Peiji, Liu Jiwen, Chen Yi, Wu Siyu, representatives from various agencies, and over 300 National Government officials attended. After the ceremony, Chairman Chiang personally conferred the seals. He Yingqin and He Yaozu received the seals separately and then proceeded with the swearing-in ceremony, witnessed by Central Committee member Hu Hanmin. He, He, and the department directors of the Ministry of Navy all raised their right hands and took the oath. After the oath, Central Committee member Hu Hanmin delivered an address, stating that it has been more than two years since the national unification, but the national military and political affairs, as well as the military, have not been fully organized. This is due to the lack of a good minister, but the biggest reason is that the military does not recognize itself as the army of the state. Comrade He has been involved in the revolution within the party for many years and recognizes that the military is the army of the state. He will definitely be able to handle his new position as Minister of Military Affairs competently and happily. Comrade He has also served in the military before and has a clear understanding of the military. Both He and He are good role models for soldiers. As for the Chinese navy, although its scale is not large, it has made great contributions in suppressing rebellion and restoring order. What we hope for now is to find ways to expand it to meet the needs of our country's extremely long coastline. It is hoped that the department directors will plan these things carefully to ensure success. Chiang then gave an address, stating that what he contributes to everyone today is the need for responsibility. The corruption of Chinese politics and the failure of the revolution are due to the fact that although there are many institutions, there are few who are responsible. He hoped that everyone would take responsibility and work hard after taking office, so that the revolution would surely succeed one day. Finally, He Yingqin, He Yaozu, and Li Shijia gave separate replies, and the ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>After He Yingqin took the oath of office at the National Government in Nanjing on the morning of the 10th, he went to the Ministry of Military Affairs and convened all officers of the rank of major or above from various departments to give a speech, outlining the key points of reforming military affairs: (1) Emphasize the selection of personnel so that everyone can use their talents to the fullest. (2) Handle military affairs according to legal codes. (3) Military supplies must be issued economically and transparently. (4) Eliminate redundant personnel and weak soldiers to cultivate elite troops. (5) Implement a frugality campaign. After the speech, the resignation of Wang Fengqing, Director of the General Affairs Department, was approved. Pan Jing, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Training and Supervision Department, was concurrently appointed. Hu Shoumin, a Counselor, had been on leave for a long time and was dismissed from his position, replaced by Liu Jianqun. Wang Zengshu, Chief Secretary, was dismissed and replaced by Tan Keming.

<p>The national financial strength is already inadequate, and all parties want to be satisfied but cannot, which is why the chaos in China is endless. The world's financial strength is only this number, and it also appears inadequate today, and each country wants to seek its own satisfaction, which is why true peace and goodwill between nations is impossible.</p>
<p>If there are too many goods in the world, increase the goods tax of other countries to protect oneself. This is the first step, and it is also the first step of each country's self-help method, which is helpless. If other countries can do nothing about it, they will also choose the goods that are sold the most in their country and increase their taxes in retaliation. As a result, it is more difficult for each country to sell goods, and the surplus of goods is more. Commerce is declining, and competition is becoming more fierce. Although peace and goodwill are sought every day, they have to become evil because of their own interests.</p>
<p>I have often said that the most indispensable goods in life are clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and clothing is the most related. The goods for clothing are cotton, so the storm of increasing and opposing taxes between India and Japan has risen. This is the beginning of the last step of economic competition in the world. From then on, it will gradually turn into hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>In short, the world's purchasing power today is not enough to match the goods manufactured in the world. Therefore, no matter what methods the manufacturers use to seek that the goods will not be surplus, the trend of decline is inevitable.</p>

<p>International Telegraph: MacDonald Declares</p>
<h3 id="e48">Optimism Still Maintained for the Naval Conference <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The Nature of Discussions Between British and French Representatives</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th. British Prime Minister MacDonald sent a wireless message from his villa to the United States today, stating that those involved in the Naval Conference do not harbor the idea that the Five-Power Conference has failed and still maintain optimism and confidence. He hopes that the people of the United States will not be disappointed prematurely. Currently, the procedures of various countries are being discussed, and there are indeed difficulties in organizing them. However, the final word of the London Naval Conference rests with the ruling figures, and none of these figures are not determined to sign a Five-Power Agreement. In October of last year, he and US President Hoover jointly declared, 'The efforts of the British and American governments in promoting world peace are not entirely the same. One does not want to participate in European diplomacy, while the other is determined to engage in cooperative policies with its European neighbors. However, both governments will use their ideas and influence to seek and maintain world peace.' This declaration will not be changed. Any treaty arising from the Naval Conference that is based on military alliances is not something we can agree to, as war alliances cannot guarantee peace.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th. The nature of the discussions between British and French representatives at the British Prime Minister's villa at the end of this week can be inferred from the statements of London legal entities. The French said that the five major naval powers hold 80% of the world's naval tonnage. If they all agree to take consistent action to deal with the war crisis, then peace should not be disturbed. Even if France cannot persuade Britain and the United States to support a security pact in the coming weeks, France does not believe that the Naval Conference will necessarily fail, because an agreement on disarmament methods will eventually be reached. When all countries are willing to guarantee the status of their warships, it can facilitate the work of the Geneva Disarmament Conference. France does not object to Britain, the United States, and Japan concluding a Three-Power or larger agreement, but judging from the British Prime Minister's wireless message to the United States, this move may not be realized. A telegram from Berlin on the 9th stated that the German Foreign Minister,</p>
<p>Dr. Curtius, when discussing the issue of communist propaganda with the Russian envoy, stated that the German government would henceforth regard the statements of the Third International as the statements of the Russian government, without distinction.</p>

French Premier Tardieu personally inspected the disaster area and, upon his return, told guests that the situation in the disaster area was similar to the devastation after the war. Before houses can be rebuilt, temporary accommodations must be provided to settle the farmers. In the future, when restoring viticulture, forests should be replanted to reduce the possibility of recurring floods.</p>

Suddenly, at 2:40 PM, there was a loud explosion, and a gas explosion occurred simultaneously, instantly burning down the theater. 104 elementary school students watching the film inside could not escape and were tragically burned to death. Another four were seriously injured. The cause of the gas explosion was that because there were no electric lights, gasoline was used to light gas lamps, leading to this tragic event.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Busan, 10th. The number of casualties in the fire at the Jinhae naval base theater is as follows: 1 female student from Jinhae, 23 elementary school students from Gyeongsang, 81 elementary school students from Jinhae, and 1 film technician, for a total of 104 deaths. Detailed investigations are still underway. The fire was caused by the film catching fire, leading to the tragic event.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Japan Wireless Radio Exhibition <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, 10th. The 5th-anniversary Wireless Radio Exhibition will open at the Tokyo Municipal Hall on the 20th of this month. Many of Japan's national inventions and new wireless radio equipment will be on display. There are also plans to experiment with the world's inventions, such as the "Telebex" artificial human (i.e., robot). The Ministry of the Army has decided to experiment with the wireless motorcycle control method invented by Major Nagayama et al., and display it to the general public. Tomorrow (the 11th), an experiment will be conducted inside the Tokyo Artillery Arsenal to control military tanks with wireless radio. At that time, officials from the Ministry of the Army and news reporters will be invited to observe. Major Nagayama, Lieutenant Hisamatsu, and Technician Haritani will be responsible for the experiment. In early April, during the Wireless Radio Exhibition, the military tanks will be controlled by wireless radio in Hibiya Park, and experiments will be conducted on forward movement, stopping, turning left and right, sounding sirens, and firing machine guns and releasing balloons. A small squad of soldiers will be deployed to test combat operations, allowing general attendees to observe.</p>

<h3 id="e59">American Circles Pay Attention to the Silver Market <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>National Press, Washington, 9th. The situation in the silver market remains the focus of attention in all circles. Senator Pittman has proposed a tax on the import of silver bullion, and representatives from mountain states are advocating for measures to encourage the production of cash. There is much debate in the Senate about this matter, and the representative from Colorado attributes the slump in silver prices to Britain's promotion of a unified gold standard for all countries. Leaders of the mining areas in that state now advocate that gold and silver should be treated equally in the settlement of international debts, saying that bimetallism is the best monetary system. Senator Pittman recently said in a speech that the reason for the sharp drop in silver prices is that Britain is selling Indian silver bullion indiscriminately on the market. This move has greatly affected cargo carriers from various states in the United States to China. The United States produces a total of 59 million ounces of silver annually, and another 11.5 million ounces are shipped from South America and other places. It is found that the annual domestic demand for silver bullion in the United States is only 40 million ounces, so the remaining 13.4 million ounces are generally exported and sold in the markets of various countries, thus causing a chaotic situation. Pittman predicts that in a considerable period of time, the demand for silver will match the production volume. The concern is that Britain does not want to keep silver bullion in India and arbitrarily sells it.</p>

<p>National Press, Port-au-Prince (Haiti), 9th. The United Press of America has received reliable information that the US presidential commission sent to inspect Haiti has approved the abolition of the US High Commissioner in Haiti and its replacement with a formal envoy. The United States and Haiti will also negotiate a new treaty. It is also reported that the US government has expressed its agreement with this plan. The commission also issued a communiqué today, recommending that after Haitian President Borno's term expires on May 15 of this year, a temporary neutral president be elected to succeed him. It is said that Presidents Borno and Hoover have both approved this proposal.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Japanese Cotton Fabric Industry Urges the Indian Parliament <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Dentsu, Osaka, 10th. The Japan National Cotton and Silk Fabric Association held a meeting in Osaka at 5:00 PM today. Regarding the Indian Parliament's decision to increase cotton fabric tariffs this time, the following resolutions were made: This time, the Indian Parliament, in disregard of the recommendations of the International Economic Conference, has made differential increases in tariffs on imported cotton yarn and fabric from countries other than Britain. In addition to increasing by 5%, it also imposes a minimum weight tax of 3.5 annas. The purpose is clearly aimed at Japan, which consumes the most Indian cotton, and it is a major threat to Japan. This kind of protectionist tax increase not only violates the spirit of the Japan-India trade treaty but will also lead the friendly relations between the two countries toward a dangerous situation. Therefore, it is hoped that the Indian Parliament will quickly withdraw the discriminatory tax increase proposal as mentioned above.</p>
<p>Reuters, Osaka, 10th. Major cotton industry associations held a meeting at the City Hall today to discuss India's imposition of a 5% protective tax on non-British cotton goods. About a thousand people attended the meeting. Speakers included the president of the Chamber of Commerce, leaders of the free trade movement, and journalists. They all spoke about the importance of unity among various sectors of the cotton industry and other matters. The meeting unanimously decided to request the Indian government to cancel this proposal. This meeting is particularly noteworthy because it is the first time that Japanese cotton importers, cotton spinners, cotton fabric manufacturers and sellers, and exporters have gathered to hold a large-scale meeting, indicating the seriousness of the situation.</p>

<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 10th. The industrial world is extremely depressed and cannot be saved by mere palliative measures such as production restrictions. Therefore, common sales proposals from all sides are gradually becoming concrete. Recently established are the Joban Smokeless Coal Association, the Nissin Flour Milling and Nippon Flour Milling agreement, the Kanto Steel Material Common Sales Association, etc. These associations also plan to persuade colleagues in the Kansai region to promote them. Only two companies currently participate in the national ammonium sulfate association. There are plans to expand the scope and include all other companies. Sakhalin Industries is negotiating a joint sales plan with both the Oji and Fuji Paper Companies. Mitsubishi Mining is planning a nationwide common sale of lump coal, with the Iwaki Coal Mine as the center. At present, common sales of bituminous coal in various places are expected to be implemented. In the kerosene industry, there is competition between Standard Oil and Rising Sun Oil, and the situation of the industry is quite difficult. However, various opinions say that in terms of Japan's fuel policy, active relief measures should be sought.</p>

The family of the late US President Taft, after consulting with the President's aide-de-camp, Colonel Hodges, today announced that Taft's remains will be given a state funeral on Tuesday and will lie in state in the Capitol for several hours. A state funeral is a special honor in the United States. In the past, only Presidents Lincoln, Garfield, and Harding, and the Unknown Soldier of the European War have received it. As for the burial site, Taft's son has selected a site on the hillside of Arlington National Cemetery, which has excellent scenery. The entire country is observing mourning, and newspapers are publishing detailed accounts of Taft's life.</p>

As for the prohibition law, there will be no additions or subtractions in this session of Congress. The Hoover administration's proposal to transfer the enforcement of prohibition laws from the Treasury Department to the Department of Justice is unlikely to face any obstacles in the Senate. There are too many opponents to the other proposals, and it is feared that they will not be successful.</p>

With my limited talent, I am deeply concerned that I will not be able to fulfill this heavy responsibility. However, with the country in turmoil and reactionaries emerging one after another, Hongkui, as a member of the military, has an inescapable duty to save the Party and the country.

<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e69">The Central Party Department and the National Government's Memorial Week <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The Central Party Department held the 50th Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the auditorium at 9:00 AM on the 10th. 500 people attended including central committee members, staff of various departments and commissions, and guests. Ye Chucang chaired the meeting. After the ceremony, the chairman reported, saying, "Recently, there have been two important events in the Party. One is the completion of the Third Plenary Session, and the other is that the Yan Xishan issue has come to an end. Since Yan issued his telegram, the public generally believed that his reasons were untenable. He also realized his mistake. Party comrades, under serious circumstances, were able to demonstrate justice, preventing all reactionaries from succeeding in their ambition to betray the Central Government and from deceiving the people with inexplicable fallacies. During this period, we have indeed been tested. The armed comrades listed in Yan's telegram, except for a few notoriously rebellious elements, have recently telegraphed to deny this, requesting the Central Government to use force to punish Yan, and are willing to be the vanguard in the punitive expedition. Party comrades at home and abroad have telegraphed to request the punitive expedition and are willing to be the rear guard, which is countless. Comrades in Peiping, Tianjin, and Shanxi, despite being subjected to heavy pressure, were able to work hard with a fearless spirit, and finally regained their freedom and completed their mission. This shows that the Party's doctrine has given the people a deep understanding, and all comrades can use the correct concept to distinguish between right and wrong, on the one hand expressing the claim of unyielding, on the other hand, carrying forward the spirit of peaceful reunification, so that the Party can achieve the final victory, which is the most comforting and most gratifying thing. On the central side, there were available troops, but they were not used out of love for peace. On the reactionary side, although there were no available troops, they wanted to use them for betrayal. The facts have been obvious. Those with simple minds want to repeat the old tricks of warlords, thinking that the method of scaring Li Yuanhong and Xu Shichang with a piece of telegram can be used again. This is due to a lack of understanding of the revolutionary spirit and the meaning of the revolution. Revolutionary comrades are never scared or deceived. The more intense the reaction, the greater the spirit of the Party. At this time when the situation is about to be resolved, a few people observe that it is the resolution of the central government's problems with the Northwest and the problems between Chiang and Yan, which is a mistake. In an independent and unified country, there must not be an object to stand against it. In the organization of a country, there cannot be a central government. There cannot be a representative in the government. For example, in a school, students of all levels should be led by the principal. The principal exercises leadership duties in a proper capacity, not managing the school in a personal capacity, which cannot be called running the school single-handedly. For example, newly appointed ambassadors to China must present their credentials to the National Government, and must present them to the representative of the Republic of China, and must not be respected in a personal capacity or any other force. This is clear. Chairman Chiang is the Marshal of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, entrusted by the Republic of China, and controls the national military with the entire central name, commanding the national army. His response to all reactions is by no means a problem between someone and someone. If this point cannot be understood thoroughly, then right and wrong, merits and demerits, cannot be judged, and the future of the country will be even more hopeless." After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>The National Government held the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at 10:00 AM on the same day. Chiang Kai-shek, Tan Yankai, Hu Hanmin, Gu Yingfen, He Yingqin, He Yaozu, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Yi, Yi Peiji, Liu Jiwen, and more than 300 officials from the National Government's Civil Affairs and Military Affairs departments attended. Chiang Kai-shek chaired the meeting. After the ceremony, Qian Changzhao, Secretary of the National Government, gave a political report, followed by a speech by Chiang, urging officials of various departments to implement the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session. The meeting adjourned. The report and speech are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Qian Changzhao reported that the Third Plenary Session closed last Thursday. Many resolutions were made at this plenary session. On the positive side, such as local self-government, economic construction, and popular education, most of the implementation methods and steps have been decided. On the negative side, such as eliminating bandits, etc., the implementation methods and steps have also been decided. From now on, the Party Department and the government can implement them practically. Regarding local self-government, we know that this kind of work is the foundation of other works during the tutelage period. Only when local self-government is successful can social undertakings be fully developed. However, local self-government focuses on the county, and there are two very important points in the conduct of party affairs and politics in each county. One is to have a sound Party Department and a competent and ethical magistrate, and the other is to have everyone understand the boundaries between the Party Department and the government, so as to ensure that there are no disputes and conflicts between the Party and the government. These two points have been taken into account in the plenary session. Regarding economic construction, there are now many constructions, which are difficult to carry out at the same time. Therefore, among various undertakings, we must distinguish between urgency and priority, and even in one undertaking, the work of each part must be distinguished between urgency and priority. When our country's human and financial resources are very scarce and very difficult, the most taboo is to support empty shows. At this moment, let me give an example. The so-called construction in Shanxi before the eleventh year of the Republic of China (let alone after the eleventh year) committed the problem of supporting empty shows. Without any preparation of human and financial resources, many agencies were set up. It looks as if everything is being done, but in fact, nothing is done or there is nothing to do. However, a few signs are hung up. The failure of Shanxi is a small example, and if the whole country engages in construction undertakings in this uneconomical way, it will surely fail. The tutelage period is very short, and we should work down-to-earth. All plans must be carefully considered, and we must not try them lightly. This point was also discussed in detail at the plenary session, and the construction from now on will be carried out in accordance with the needs of the people, based on human and financial resources, and in sequence. Regarding education, its importance is known to all. The plenary session declaration also stated that "from now on, our efforts must not only build a society of the Three Principles of the People through education but also enrich the country of the Three Principles of the People through education." I think there is one thing that brooks no delay, which is the determination of education funding. A clever woman cannot cook without rice. If there is no definite funding, education cannot be done well. Just look at the capital special municipality, with a population of more than 500,000 and more than 50,000 school-age children, but the city's elementary school funding is only more than 30,000 yuan per month. There are 34 elementary schools, with more than 11,000 students. As a result, there are more than 700 private schools, with more than 18,000 students. Because of funding, the City Education Bureau cannot add elementary schools or classrooms. Recently, there have been more than 3,000 children who have registered but cannot be admitted. Even parents and brothers surround the school and ask why their children are not allowed to enroll. This phenomenon is extremely pitiful. If the capital is like this,</p>

<h3 id="e70">News Highlights <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>This is the case everywhere else. It is the case in elementary schools, middle schools, and universities alike. There is indeed a pressing need to seek remedies. The education funds for each province, city, and county nationwide should be earnestly determined. The above is the focus on the positive aspects of the Third Plenary Session. The elimination of bandits, from a negative perspective, is comparatively more important. Currently, bandits are everywhere, and the general populace cannot live and work in peace. Some are dead, others are displaced. Some people with assets dare not live in the countryside, and some even dare not live in small towns. As a result, the countryside becomes poorer and poorer every day, turning into a world of thieves. If this continues, the vitality of the people will be almost exhausted, and future recovery will be extremely difficult. The Plenary Session specifically put forward a special project for this reason. In any case, bandits must be eradicated in the shortest possible time. Orders must be carried out, otherwise all social undertakings will be impossible to carry out. In short, the significance of this meeting is very great. All the resolutions are suitable for China's current needs. As long as we earnestly work hard, the implementation of political tutelage will definitely be very smooth. Mr. Yan Xishan telegraphed his resignation. Mr. Zhao Daiwen telegraphed, mentioning that Mr. Yan had a great awakening and was willing to go abroad. Mr. Yan's remarks before his resignation were like a bolt from the blue, while this resignation was like the sudden clearing of the clouds to reveal the sun when a storm is about to break. It may not be a blessing for the Party and the country. What Mr. Zhao meant by Mr. Yan's great awakening must have been partly a feeling that his previous words and deeds towards the Central Government were not loyal to the Party, and partly a regret for falling into the trap of the reactionaries. If Mr. Yan has truly awakened, his resignation is natural, and his willingness to go abroad is also a very smart move. Because the general public, after several civil wars, are like birds startled by the twang of a bow. They see Mr. Yan's bizarre attitude, and if there is no action now to show his sincerity, their suspicions and fears will still exist. Mr. Yan's departure abroad can somewhat show his sincerity, and society can be stabilized. Moreover, the reactionaries are ubiquitous. Even if Mr. Yan has a great awakening, they will still try to maintain ties with him, and may even go to surround him. Since the bad environment cannot be changed immediately, it is better to leave, so that both body and mind can find peace. Therefore, for the sake of the Party and the country, and for the sake of Mr. Yan's personal interests, going abroad is the best policy. As for the Central Government, it has always been broad-minded. As long as peace and unification are achieved, it will still try to help Mr. Yan in any way that does not compromise the overall situation and can enhance his personal reputation. Chairman Chiang's speech: The Third Plenary Session has concluded. It has been found that at the Second Plenary Session, many important cases were resolved. By the time the Third Plenary Session was convened, the audit of what had been implemented in accordance with the resolutions in the past eight months was only about one-tenth or two-tenths of what was decided. This was because the various departments below the government failed to pay attention, and this phenomenon occurred. Although the Party headquarters and the government repeatedly urged at that time, some departments simply ignored it. The Chinese people's problem is that they can talk but cannot act. Foreigners have also criticized our country for this. In the future, it is hoped that the various departments will pay close attention to the various resolutions of the Third Plenary Session and the declarations of the Congress, and strive to realize them, so as to avoid criticism from foreigners. In addition, during the revolutionary era, Party and government colleagues were concerned about relying on personal conscience and working hard. For this resolution, do not use the excuse of lack of economic resources and talent, and strive to do it. Also, regarding the issue of thrift and reducing government spending, the various departments must improve at any time. The chief officer in charge must conduct on-site inspections of the department members, and must use their mouths, eyes, hands, and hearts. Do not be greedy and insatiable. Redundant personnel must be reduced, so that useful funds can be freed up to engage in construction.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Ministry of Finance's Financial Report for the 17th Year <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>(Continued) (Continued)</p>
<p>Although the government has been facing military affairs and has been busy in recent years with domestic and foreign debts without collateral, in order to maintain national credit, it has appointed the President of the Executive Yuan, the Minister of Finance, and relevant ministers and important personnel to form a special committee to study and discuss the plan for repaying domestic and foreign debts without collateral. As a result, significant progress has been made. This year, a definite method can be determined. The initial plan is for the government to allocate 5 million yuan annually as preparation for clearing the case.</p>
<p>Someone in the country once suggested that if the Ministry of Finance wants to obtain economic assistance, it should find ways to borrow foreign debt. However, the policy of the Ministry of Finance is that foreign debt can only be accepted if the conditions are appropriate and do not harm the country's economic sovereignty. Otherwise, it will never be contacted. In the past year, the Ministry of Finance has comprehensively planned the debts for which the ministry is responsible for the domestic and foreign debt issues, and formulated a proper repayment plan, so that one party will not harm national rights, and the other party will be satisfied with the general creditors.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Ministry of Finance earnestly hopes that the various government agencies will give full understanding and recognition. It takes a lot of effort to restore national credit, and it is not easy. It relies on the strength of the group. In particular, it is hoped that no matter where, do not regard rash borrowing as a trivial matter. It is important to know that partial default of the government is enough to affect the whole, and the credibility of all countries to us will also have considerable losses. In other words, the country's credit is closely related to the government as a whole, and a slight movement can affect the whole body.</p>
<p>Government bonds and treasury bills: In recent years, the government has had to issue government bonds and treasury bills again and again in order to unify the military and implement demobilization. However, things went against expectations, and the purpose of demobilization was difficult to achieve. However, the issued bonds are guaranteed by extremely reliable income, and at the same time, representatives of various banks and groups are ordered to convene to form a fund custody committee. Therefore, the bonds have become a major market. In addition to banks, ordinary people are also very enthusiastic about buying and selling bonds. On the one hand, it is due to the stagnant business and surplus funds. On the other hand, it can also prove the value of government bonds, which is enough to make the general public believe in them.</p>
<p>Issuing bonds for a long time to meet the urgent needs of the military and political affairs is indeed an expedient measure, and it is by no means the right way to manage finances. The financial authorities know this best. However, because peace has not been restored, a comprehensive policy cannot be implemented. In order to cope with the current environment, this is a last resort. The fundamental solution is still to achieve peace before it is possible to reorganize.</p>
<p>Central Bank: Our party successively established the Central Bank in Guangzhou and Hankou, and experienced hardships. However, it was not discouraged by this, and the policy of organizing this bank has never been changed. However, before the Northern Expedition was successful, if paper money was issued indiscriminately to fill the military needs, the future financial risks would be unimaginable. Therefore, the establishment of the Central Bank was delayed. It was not until the completion of the Northern Expedition that it was established on November 1, 17th year. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance formulated regulations and systems, and the management of business was particularly strict. The handling of paper money was particularly cautious, and the government and various public groups, the board of directors and the board of supervisors, worked together to handle the bank's affairs, in order to show great trust. Therefore, after more than a year of establishment, although it has repeatedly experienced various shocks in politics and military affairs, it has been able to pass through smoothly. The development in the past year is not without its spectacle. If the situation is peaceful, its future is difficult to limit.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Central Bank, everything is held with prudence, and the government's financial credit is also implicitly increased. Moreover, whenever the situation is tense and interest rates soar, it uses police funds to lend to peers at lower interest rates, and the market is calm.</p>
<p>The domestic debt fund, which was previously deposited in foreign banks, has now been deposited in the Central Bank. If the overall situation is stable and the government's major plans are implemented, the Central Bank, due to its position, can be the central agency for reorganizing finance and maintaining the market. The asset and liability summary table of the bank one year after its establishment is attached below. (Attachment omitted)</p>
<p>Expert Committee: In the past two years, the Ministry of Finance has hired a number of expert committee members to plan financial improvements. In the summer of the 17th year, an economic conference was convened to solicit the opinions of bankers and businessmen across the country on economic construction. Salt affairs and tobacco and alcohol have also been assigned committee members to hold meetings to study improvements. The most important thing is the Design Committee. The committee is organized by American economic and financial experts hired by the Ministry of Finance. The chairman is Dr. Kemmerer. Dr. Kemmerer has extensive knowledge and experience. The committee's responsibility is to study major domestic currency and financial plans, such as improving the monetary system, reorganizing tax revenue, and national revenue and expenditure budgets, accounting management, and methods for restoring national credit. The results obtained have been compiled into various reports, ready to be submitted to the State Council. Among them, there are issues related to people's livelihood and national economy, which the public should pay attention to. In the future, it is also planned to publish and disseminate them. Dr. Kemmerer has completed his mission and has returned to his country. However, there are still several expert committee members who are continuing to be hired to help gather ideas.</p>
<p>Civil Service Examination System: The Ministry of Finance uses personnel in the same way as other government agencies. Due to the relationship between facts and needs during the Northern Expedition military era, there was no time to choose. However, there are not many talents with administrative experience. Now that the Examination Yuan has been established, there should be a perfect method to improve the system of registration and advancement.</p>
<p>The civil service examination system has not yet been implemented, but the Ministry of Finance still maintains the original examination procedures of the various agencies under its jurisdiction. For example, customs service personnel must pass an examination. This good system is worth maintaining. Because there is this system and order, the current method is not only for customs, but also for inland regular customs such as Wuhu Yangyou Fengyang, etc., which are now merged into the customs for handling, in order to imitate this system.</p>
<p>The Salt Affairs Audit Office also adopts the same policy. The most important reason for the Ministry of Finance to restore the audit offices in various places is that the office has an excellent examination system. The personnel in the office are experienced and trained. The Tobacco Tax Office under the Ministry of Finance is the third most important. Although the examination system is not fully applicable, the appointment, removal, and promotion of some personnel have also imitated the examination system. In the future, the candidates for the director of the office may change, but the staff can definitely not be changed in conjunction.</p>
<p>The annual amount of Likin revenue is as high as 70 million yuan. Although it is nominally a national tax, the personnel who handle it are dispatched by the local authorities. There are numerous bureaus and cards. The collection method is extremely cumbersome, and the personnel are extremely mixed. There are hundreds of malpractices, which is inevitable. This kind of agency has no fundamental improvement method. Even if there is a good examination system, it will not help. The only thing is to resolutely abolish it at the scheduled time.</p>
<p>After the abolition of Likin, customs, salt, and cigarette tax revenue accounts for nine-tenths of the ministry's revenue. Since the examination system has been adopted for most of it, it should not be difficult for all agencies under the Ministry of Finance to adopt the examination system in the future. However, the salaries of customs and audit personnel are relatively high compared to other agencies, so the issue of treatment standards is slightly difficult.</p>
<p>Cultivating the integrity of the general staff and a good atmosphere cannot be achieved without strictly implementing the examination system and guaranteeing the law. This system is the only fundamental way to solve the problem of personnel.</p>
<p>Budget: Although there are military bandits and famines in the country, the price of silver has fallen, and there is financial panic, the financial problem is not absolutely impossible to solve. It is only when the situation is slightly peaceful, the budget can be established, the use will not be as scattered and unfounded as before, and the administration will not be as hurried as before, then the financial future can be hoped for.</p>
<p>Our party recognized the need for a budget early on. With the establishment of a budget, the government's work can have a certain scope and steps. Public budget can also gain the belief of the general public. Therefore, it advocates the establishment of a budget in the shortest possible time. When the Ministry of Finance holds the plenary session of the Central Executive Committee, and when it holds economic conferences, financial conferences, disarmament conferences, and demobilization conferences, it also asks the government to pay special attention to the implementation of this issue. Because the government has no budget, it will inevitably come and go from the east to the west, and support itself from the left and the right. A thorough financial plan cannot be implemented. The government only has the power to levy taxes, but has no public report on revenue and expenditure, which is a major obstacle to cooperation between the government and the people.</p>
<p>The biggest difficulty in establishing a budget is the inability to predict the need for and restriction of military spending. The government has also repeatedly tried its best to reduce military spending to the minimum. For example, at the first demobilization conference in February of the 18th year, the major generals of all parties saw the government's revenue and expenditure summary table, and unanimously decided that the military budget, in addition to the demobilization expenses, should be limited to 19.2 million yuan per year. However, the Guifeng warlords successively initiated turmoil, and the resolution was in vain. When Guifeng was gradually resolved, the government renewed the demobilization conference with the opportunity of reorganization, and slightly increased the military spending, setting it at 21.6 million yuan per year, plus 30 million yuan for demobilization expenses. However, the civil strife frequently occurred again in a short period of time, which forced the government to use all means to raise military supplies and overcome the difficult hurdle of borrowing from the east to the west.</p>
<p>The military spending listed in the table, from July of the 17th year to June of the 18th year, totaled 209,536,969 yuan. However, this number is not the total amount of military spending in the country. All expenditures in the three northeastern provinces, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Xikang, Gansu, Shanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Guangxi are not included. (The military spending in the above provinces sometimes illegally forces loans, pre-levies money, grain, and donations, and uses them to cope with it.) If the total number of these provinces is combined, it exceeds the number set by the two demobilization conferences, and I don't know how many.</p>
<p>In the end, how should our country's military spending be limited, so that the Ministry of Finance will not have to dig everywhere, and how can the Ministry of Finance have surplus funds to take care of construction projects and repay domestic and foreign debts? The key to this is the issue of national peace. The Ministry of Finance itself cannot do anything. If this problem can be solved satisfactorily, then the future implementation of constitutional government, economic construction, international status, and financial reorganization can be easily solved. It is only through the sincere cooperation of the party, the country, and the people, and overcoming difficulties together, that success can be achieved. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e74">National Meteorological Conference to Open <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Convened by the Central Meteorological Research Institute</p>
<p>To be Held in Nanjing on April 16</p>
<p>The Meteorological Research Institute of the National Central Research Institute, in view of the increasing number of meteorological institutions in our country recently, while weather reports are still lacking in coordination, has decided to convene a national meteorological conference on April 16 of this year, gathering various institutions related to meteorological undertakings, to discuss important matters such as codes and signals, in order to achieve unified effectiveness. Letters have recently been sent to various institutions to discuss the original letter as follows: "Dear Sir, in recent years, our country's meteorological undertakings have gradually shown signs of booming, and the number of weather observation institutions is increasing day by day. However, observation and verification rely on cooperation, and the language and signals are especially important for unification. For example, meteorological codes, transmission reports, etc., all need to be standardized. Our institute has now approved the letter from the Meteorological Society of China, requesting to notify all weather observation institutions and various associations related to meteorology across the country to hold a national meteorological conference on a regular basis to consolidate and so on. It is very necessary. It is now scheduled to be held at the Meteorological Research Institute of the Arctic Pavilion in the capital on April 16 of this year. The National Meteorological Conference will discuss meteorological codes, observation time, transmission methods, meteorological signals, etc., in order to seek unity. Please prepare proposals and send representatives to attend the meeting accordingly. Please check and handle it. Please also reply if you can send representatives to attend at that time. I sincerely appreciate your friendship."</p>
<h3 id="e75">Jin Army Withdraws North and Tianjin-Pukou Railway Traffic <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: This time, the provincial army's withdrawal from Dezhou and the Jin army's advance into Dezhou are actions to avoid conflict. In fact, there is no war. Now that the situation has eased, it is not difficult to resolve it with political means. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway runs through the north and south. Since the railway bridge over the Yellow River Cliff in northern Shandong was destroyed, traffic has been interrupted for a week, and goods have been piled up, and travelers have sighed. Everyone is eager for traffic to resume as soon as possible. According to news received today, Fu Zuoyi has telegraphed, stating that the troops under his command will never cross the northern border of Hebei, and asked to repair the bridge and resume traffic as soon as possible. It is said that Chen Tiaoyuan is currently discussing with the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau, and the date of resumption of traffic may not be far away. As for the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Yellow River Iron Bridge, which was blown up on the evening of the 2nd, the section in Jinjin should be repaired by Tianjin, but due to the interruption of the railway, Tianjin cannot come south. Therefore, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau telegraphed the Jinan-Han section to survey and repair in order to restore traffic. Engineer Hu Shenghong has followed the order to go to Jinbei for a survey. It is reported that the location of the iron bridge is 35 miles north of Pingyuan Station and 4 miles south of Yellow River Cliff Station. The Yellow River's old channel belongs to Lijiamiao. The place that was blown up is the eighth hole from north to south. The blown-off length is 25 meters, and two steel beams for installing sleepers are damaged. Because the steel beams are German goods, they still need to be purchased from Germany, and about 2,000 yuan is needed. If it is necessary to repair and resume traffic urgently, only sleepers can be used to support the roof first to lay railway tracks. It is estimated that 5,000 sleepers are needed. All available sleepers in Jinan have been collected, but it is still difficult to meet this number. Although there are many sleepers stored in Pukou, about 100,000, there are no vehicles and they cannot be transported. Therefore, there is currently no way. Engineer Hu has drawn a picture and submitted it to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau for review. (8th)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Zhang Huizan Appointed Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>A Nanchang dispatch from the 7th reports that bandit-communists in Jiangxi Province are rampant, ravaging over twenty counties, and have not been completely eradicated for a long time. It is now heard that General Commander Chiang Kai-shek has discussed suppression methods with Division Commanders Jin Handing and Zhang Huizan, and with Zhang's agreement, has appointed Zhang as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Jiangxi Province. The 18th Division Headquarters received a telegram from the General Headquarters yesterday: "To the 18th Division Headquarters in Nanchang: Division Commander Zhang Huizan of the 18th Division is hereby appointed as Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Jiangxi Province. All troops stationed in Jiangxi Province shall be under his command. A separate telegram and commission order will be issued. You are to comply accordingly. [Signed] Zhong Zheng, [Stamped] Wei Can." It has just been learned from a telegram from Zhang in Beijing to Chief of Staff Xiao of the 18th Division that Zhang is scheduled to depart on the 5th to return to the province, inspecting the defenses of northern Jiangxi and the Nanxun Railway along the way. He should arrive in the province today or tomorrow. After Zhang arrives in the province, he will go to western Jiangxi to command the various brigades to eradicate Zhu De and Mao Zedong. As for the situation of the Jiangxi bandits, a report has just been received from Cheng Brigade in Ji'an that the main force of Zhu De has retreated to Donggu, at the junction of Xingguo, Yongfeng, Ningdu, and Ji'an. This is Zhu's old nest (when Zhu retreated from Fujian, Li Shaojiu and Duan Yuequan used this as their base). In the area of Pitou and Chikou, government troops are still pursuing them. The incoming telegram is recorded below: (1) According to a phone report from Regiment Commander Peng, the main force of Zhu De and Mao Zedong has now retreated to Donggu, Fukou, and Pitou. Only a few robbers are present in Zhangjiadu and Futan. Furthermore, the bandits who previously crossed the Yinxia River were defeated by Zeng Battalion and retreated to the east bank. (2) According to a phone call from Regiment Commander Huang, the Independent 23rd Regiment of the bandit army, which attacked Anfu County the day before yesterday, was defeated by the two battalions led by Zhi and Wen. The bandits then fled to Longzhou Xiaochikou. Wei has dispatched Guan Battalion, the Sanqutan Guerrilla Team led by Wang Mingde, and the Yongxin Peacekeeping Team led by Gu Chonghan to suppress them. Furthermore, a visitor from Jishui said that when Zhu's bandits attacked Jishui City, Tang Brigade firmly defended the city. Zhu De then led a large force to cross the river and besiege the city. Coincidentally, Zhu Brigade and Yi Regiment arrived and saw the bandits crossing the river in civilian boats, so they took the opportunity to attack. Gunfire and artillery shells rained down, sinking many bandit boats. About a thousand bandits were either hit by stray bullets or drowned. The siege of Jishui has now been lifted. The newly appointed County Magistrate Cheng Daozhou, because order has been restored in the county, took a boat to Jishui on the 6th to take office.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Taiwanese Ice Fish Flood Quanzhou <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>A Xiamen dispatch reports that most coastal residents in Fujian Province engage in fishing. Their methods still use old-fashioned nets, which require a lot of labor but yield little fish. Furthermore, they lack ice storage facilities, so the abundance of fish depends on the tides or the weather. The market often feels that supply cannot meet demand, or supply exceeds demand, resulting in the highest and lowest value fluctuations. Fishermen also feel that if they catch little, it is not enough to make a living, and if they catch a lot, they must sell it immediately. Last year, a Japanese fishing company planned to develop the South China Sea fishing grounds, which it later implemented, using machine trawlers to fish in the Taiwan Strait and between Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Xiamen. Wherever the trawlers went, the fish schools were emptied. Our country's old-style manual fishing cannot compete. As a result, the coastal fishing industry has been greatly affected. The Japanese fishing company is very large. After catching fish, it immediately places them in ice storage ships, carries them back to Taiwan, stores them in ice cellars, and then transports them to other ports for sale according to market needs. Last August, Quanzhou fish merchant Chen Longqing went to Taiwan by steamship to sell large quantities of frozen fresh fish in Quanzhou. The value was cheaper than that obtained by local methods, and there was an adequate supply of various types of fish. As a result, everyone bought Taiwanese ice fish. Recently, the Quanzhou market has been flooded with Taiwanese ice fish, and the local fishing industry is declining rapidly. According to people in the fishing industry, the losses to the domestic fishing industry in Quanzhou during the past six or seven months are no less than hundreds of thousands of yuan. This month, the Jinjiang fishermen felt that foreign aggression was increasing daily, and they had to seek resistance to survive. Kang Sirui and others promoted the organization of a fishing industry union to unite the fishermen of Quanzhou and Hui'an into a large-scale organization and to establish a cooperative to resist Japanese fish. It has been reported to the local party headquarters and the government for record. (March 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e78">The Arrogance of Russians in Manzhouli <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Galloping Through the Streets, Singing and Shouting Late at Night</p>
<p>Forming Teams to Patrol and Transport Contraband</p>
<p>Beating Our Military Police and Lodging Protests</p>
<p>A Harbin dispatch from the 4th reports that at 10:40 PM on February 28th, two teams of Soviet infantry, about 300 officers and soldiers, 100 cavalrymen, and over 100 artillerymen and special forces, along with two aircraft, 13 automobiles, and armored vehicles, arrived on the main road from Dauri to Abagaitu on the Manchurian border. On the morning of March 1st, more infantry and cavalry arrived, and military transport vehicles continued to come and go. According to our investigation, there are already more than two regiments of Russian cavalry stationed in Abagaitu, with approximately one battalion each of artillery and infantry. This place is only a short distance from our border. What is the purpose? It is unknown. However, according to the Soviet international reception staff stationed in Manzhouli, it is because White Russian warfare was discovered in Sanhe within our territory, and heavy troops are stationed on the border to prevent the White Party. But this does not match the situation at the Russian consulate in Manzhouli. Because on the 26th of last month, 31 soldiers from the Russian State Defense Political Bureau, in several military vehicles, drove directly into Manzhouli Station and stopped in front of the Russian consulate. The vehicles were loaded with 68 huge boxes. Judging from the difficulty of moving them, it can be determined that they must contain military supplies. When Manzhouli Customs attempted to inspect, they were forcibly refused. In recent days, many young Russians have been entering and exiting the Russian consulate, all wearing plain clothes and carrying handguns, rampaging through the streets and causing trouble everywhere. Merchants and residents close their shops in succession after 5:00 PM. In the Tolan-nor area, Soviet Russian plainclothes propaganda teams have appeared, spreading leaflets and promoting communism in groups of three or five. The Chinese merchants in the coal mine area, who had gradually returned after the war, are now unable to live in peace and are panicking and fleeing to the interior. It is also rumored that Russian plainclothes soldiers are densely stationed around the Manzhouli area. Each Red Russian worker at each station has received handguns and bombs. If the Sino-Russian official conference can see the dawn, there may be no trouble on the border. Otherwise, once it breaks down, a major chaos could erupt at any moment. As for the ferocity and disorder of the Russian Red Party in Manzhouli Station, it is beyond the control of the police force. One day, at 11:30 PM, three policemen from the Russian consulate clashed with a special police patrol leader named Shang at the corner of Wudao Street in Manzhouli Station because they did not know the password and broke through the sentry post. The three Russian policemen actually snatched Shang's handgun. At around 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, more than 30 members of the Red Party galloped through the streets, with bare arms, singing loudly, causing pedestrians to avoid them. When passing Erdao Street, they encountered Chen Zhende, a soldier from the Sixth Company of the 51st Regiment under Liang Zhongjia. The Russians called together workers from the electric light factory and over 100 members of the youth party and surrounded Chen, attacking him. Over ten special police officers, including Liu Baoxin, Zhao Delong, and road patrolman Ren Fayou, arrived to mediate and were also beaten, and Liu Baoxin's handgun was taken. Later, a large team of military police came to rescue Chen Zhende and sent him to the hospital for treatment. He was seriously injured. The military police then arrested five Red Party members who committed the crime and sent them to the police station. In the evening, the Russian side protested and demanded the release of the people from the police station. Shao Qinghuai, the chief of the Third Special Police Headquarters, came to Harbin today to request instructions. The arrogance of the Russians is becoming increasingly evident.</p>

<p>Because of financial constraints, Governor Zhang Jingjiang of the Provincial Government is urgently seeking solutions, and the construction expenses to be paid are very large. Today (the 10th) at 9:00 PM, a banquet was held at the Laiyin Xiaozhu on West Lake (Zhang's mansion) to discuss loan matters with Chairman Wang of the General Chamber of Commerce and over twenty people from the banking and money industries, including Jin Runquan and Mi Tingfang. Shen Ming and others, members of the Provincial Capital Three Granaries Committee, believe that the porridge factory at Qiyu is being extended by one month until the end of this month, and rice prices are soaring, making life difficult for the common people. They have decided to petition the Department of Civil Affairs to start selling grain at subsidized prices ahead of schedule. However, the current stock of 5,000 stones of grain is only enough for one month. It is proposed to request the Department of Civil Affairs to allocate 60,000 yuan of subsidized grain funds approved last year in order to rush to buy grain.</p>
<p>Qian Wenxuan, the director of the Liangzhe Audit Branch, went to Yushao Changchan on the 2nd of this month to inspect the production area and summoned the chiefs of the weighing and releasing bureau and the field magistrate to discuss measures to rectify production and sales and expand tax revenue. He then went from Yao to Ningbo and Shanghai to present the proposed rectification measures to Chief Supervisor Zhu of the Audit General Office for review. He returned to Hangzhou yesterday.

<p>Military prisoners transferred to military prison. The military prisoners held in the Caohejing Jiangsu Second Prison have been transferred. Fifty prisoners were escorted by troops from the Garrison Command to Suzhou in January and transferred to the Second Army Prison. Yesterday (the 10th), a platoon of troops from the Garrison Command, led by Platoon Leader Qiu, arrived at the Caohejing Second Prison at 3:00 PM to pick up 100 military prisoners and escorted them to the Army Prison for detention.</p>
<p>The High Court will recruit prison staff. Lin, the president of the Jiangsu High Court, recently investigated the escape of prisoners from county detention centers. This is due to the poor management of the prison staff. Although there have been frequent transfers, there is a lack of competent personnel. Therefore, he specially petitioned the Ministry of Justice to formulate regulations to recruit prison staff. Once the Ministry approves the order, the recruitment will begin and personnel will be dispatched to various detention centers to take office. Counter-revolutionary prisoners from Taixian are escorted to Suzhou.

<p>Standing Committee of the Property Department. The County Property Management Office held a standing committee meeting on the 10th. Zhang Xiaomei presided over the meeting. The agenda included the repair of the Confucian Temple and the allocation of funds for dredging the river. There were resolutions to reply to the County Government.

<p>Verdict in an extortion case. The case of Wu Bogeng, a gentry in the town, who received a threatening letter last winter demanding a large sum of money, was investigated by the Public Security Bureau after Wu reported it. Yin Bohua, a patrol officer from the First District Branch, arrested two suspicious men and women, including Shen Shiqing, in a certain place. Because that place was the agreed place for the extortion and it was a place that Shen and others did not usually go to, their actions were very suspicious. After being arrested and sent to the county, they were interrogated repeatedly. The case was proposed and sentenced today. Shen Shiqing was sentenced to two months in prison, and his wife was released on bail.</p>
<p>A woman lost her gold bracelet on her way to Shanghai. Yesterday (the 10th), a mother and daughter named Li and a maid from outside the West Gate of Songjiang planned to take the 1:09 PM express train to Shanghai. When the train arrived at Songjiang Station, it was extremely crowded. After the three of them boarded the train one after another, Mrs. Li took money out of her cheongsam pocket to give to the porters. Unexpectedly, a gold bracelet (weighing about nine qian and five fen) and forty yuan in banknotes wrapped in silk were exposed and stolen by a pickpocket. When Mrs. Li was seated, the train had already started, and she realized what had happened. She immediately called the train police to investigate, but there was no trace. However, according to Mrs. Li, when I sat down, it seemed to be still by my side, so a certain young man next to me was highly suspected. Later, when the train arrived at Shanghai Station, after inspection, nothing was found. It seems that the fate of losing money cannot be reversed. It is heard that Mrs. Li is the sister of Li Zuchun. This trip to Shanghai is for her son to marry someone in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Lu Shen was falsely accused and detained. Lu Linzhu, the director of the County Public Education Center, was walking home from the center at about 5:00 PM on the 8th when he was arrested by the Public Security Bureau detective team and sent to the County Government. For a time, the reason was unknown, and the people were shocked. Jin Boqin from the Chamber of Commerce and Lu Shunxiang from the Education Association, along with seven or eight others, visited County Magistrate Chen to inquire about the truth and request bail. It was then learned that it was a secret order from the Department of Civil Affairs to arrest and monitor the case. The reason was that Zhuge Zhongwen, who lived in the eastern township of this county, had mailed a report to the Department of Civil Affairs accusing Lu Linxun, Shen Zhongxuan, the head of Lianxi Elementary School, Pan Zhijiu, the director of academic affairs, Ji Hanjun, Zhang Naizhang, Zhang Changjiao, the former county executive committee members, and Yu Guanli and Xia Menghuan, the workers, of having solid evidence of reaction. After visiting the people involved, investigating the evidence, it was all false. Moreover, no one named Zhuge has been heard of in the entire county. It is obviously a false accusation. They immediately requested bail, but it was not allowed. At about 3:00 AM that night, Shen Zhongxuan was also arrested by detectives in Nanxiang and sent to Jiading to be detained in the police team with Lu. The people in the education community were greatly dissatisfied when they heard the news and went to the Education Bureau to ask Director Yang to negotiate with the county and meet with the county magistrate.

<p>Recent Rice Prices Continue to Rise: Zhenjiang rice prices have been gradually increasing due to the shortage of supply caused by the disasters in Jiangbei. Recently, continuous rainfall has further reduced supply from the countryside around Heshia, causing market prices to rise by another four or five jiao per shi (unit of dry measure) compared to the previous two days.

However, in recent years, due to repeated banditry, the collection has been sold off. It is heard that if no measures are taken to preserve this treasure, it will inevitably continue to be dispersed. The Provincial Department of Education, seeing this, has submitted a request to the Provincial Government to order Wang Xiantang, the director of the Provincial Library, to work with the Liaocheng County Head and local organizations to investigate the Yang family collection. The investigation has been completed. In addition to the books that have already been lost, there are still more than 200,000 volumes. Wang and others have registered them one by one. The 43rd standing meeting of the Provincial Government has decided to order the Departments of Civil Affairs and Education to jointly build the Haiyuan Pavilion in the Zhongshan Hall of the Provincial Library to preserve the collection. They have also jointly drafted temporary preservation measures to temporarily move out a suitable location in the library to purchase book boxes and shelves. Once the collection arrives, it will be stored immediately, and a detailed plan for the construction of the Haiyuan Pavilion will be actively drafted for permanent preservation.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Victory Over Soochow University</p>
<p>55 to 27</p>
<p>The East China Intercollegiate Athletic Association basketball championship has concluded yesterday. Shanghai University first lost to Ginling, then defeated Soochow yesterday to win the championship. Ginling lost to Shanghai University but defeated Soochow, ranking second.

<p>The game between Shanghai University and Soochow University yesterday began at 4 PM. Referee: Smith. Shanghai University started strong, scoring ten consecutive points. Soochow University did not score until a few minutes before the end of the first half when Soochow’s momentum suddenly increased, achieving several points, but it was fleeting and did not last. At the end of the first half, Shanghai University led with a score of 24 to 12.</p>
<p>After the break, Shanghai University took advantage of their momentum, and their performance became even stronger. Not only did the substitution of players not diminish their strength, but it intensified their efforts. Sun Zemin repeatedly made great contributions, and A Liang's long shots were effective. Soochow’s defense was flawed, and their shots were inaccurate, making the situation increasingly dire. As a result, Shanghai University won with a score of 55 to 27.</p>

<p>(1) Confidence in Winning Championships</p>
<p>Japan has long been preparing for the 9th Far Eastern Games. Athletes for various competitions will be selected successively. Japan has always been inferior to China and the Philippines in volleyball and basketball tactics. Therefore, athletes for these two sports have been specially announced in advance and are currently undergoing intense training in the hope of winning and ending China and the Philippines' dominance in the Far Eastern Games. The enthusiasm of the Japanese is truly astonishing. According to general speculation, Japan will still be the winner of this year's games because Japan is sure to win in four out of the eight sports, namely track and field (five and ten events), baseball, and tennis. As for volleyball and basketball, Japan also has the hope of winning. Only in soccer may they not be able to defeat China, and in swimming, they may not be as good as the Philippines. But for the rest, they have a great chance of winning. The championship of each track and field competition always belongs to Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e117">(2) Track and Field Athletes <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Track and field is the most important of the eight sports, and strong countries and races pay attention to track and field because it represents the spirit of a strong country. Victory can greatly show the strength of the nation. The Japan Athletic Association recently surveyed dozens of elite athletes in Japan and selected them as representatives of the Japanese track and field team for the Far Eastern Games. Their names and results are recorded below. It is hoped that the people of our country will quickly rise up and strive for improvement.</p>

<p>The Two-Roads Bureau also held a public memorial ceremony and tree planting in Nanxiang.</p>
<p>The 12th of this month is the fifth anniversary of the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Chinese Nationalist Party, and also the Arbor Day stipulated by the central government. In addition to holding a memorial meeting at the Shanghai Business Association at 9 AM, the Municipal Executive Committee has also issued a notice specifying that a tree planting ceremony will be held at 1 PM at the civilian residences on Quanjia'an Road, about two li east of the park shooting range on North Sichuan Road, and designating this location as the tree planting site for each district branch. Seedlings have been obtained from the tree planting ceremony preparation committee. It is reported that the Municipal Executive Committee has ordered each district party department to instruct their respective branches to send three representatives to plant trees, expressing the Premier's intention to benefit the people.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Fundraising for Premier Sun's Bronze Statue <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department Orders District Branches to Undertake</p>
<p>The case of constructing a bronze statue of the Premier in this city was proposed by the former Municipal Steering Committee in the 17th year, and was unanimously approved by all sectors of society. However, it could not be implemented due to funding issues. Now, the sixth citywide representative assembly has resolved to order all district branches to undertake fundraising. The assembly secretariat issued an order to each district branch yesterday, starting fundraising, with the original order stating: "In order to comply with the matter, it was proposed by the former municipal steering committee in this city during the celebration of Premier Sun's birthday in the 17th year to construct a bronze statue of Premier Sun in Zhabei for people to admire. It was unanimously approved by all sectors of society at the time. However, the construction funds have not yet been raised in full, so it could not be implemented. Now, the sixth citywide representative assembly has resolved that the assembly secretariat order each district party department to instruct its respective district branches to start fundraising from March 10th to the end of March. Each district branch must remit funds to the municipal party department every ten days and send them to the Shanghai Bank. The amount donated by each district branch must be at least ten yuan. Those who undertake to donate are not limited to comrades in one branch. In addition to the separate orders, two copies of the official receipts from each district party department and one copy of the temporary receipts from each district branch are hereby issued, so that each district branch can comply with them. Furthermore, if the donors are comrades of this party, the district branch will issue a temporary receipt and not issue a separate official receipt. The district party department will issue a general receipt. If they are not comrades of this party, they should apply to the district party department for an official receipt to be issued, in order to be cautious."</p>

Since the conclusion of the Sino-Danish trade treaty last year, the friendly relations between the two countries have further progressed. However, the revolution in our country has not yet succeeded, and the construction of various aspects is extremely simple and crude. We are deeply sorry that Your Highness's visit has not been able to make any contributions. Crown Prince Danish's reply was also extremely humble, repeatedly mentioning that the diplomatic relations between the two countries are becoming closer day by day. After talking for about half an hour, Zhang and others shook hands and said goodbye.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special City Executive Committee resolved at its 99th regular meeting to reply to Yan Xishan by telegram, urging him to go abroad soon. This telegram was sent out yesterday. The original telegram stated: "Urgent National Affairs, Taiyuan, Mr. Yan Baichuan: Since you sent your telegram, the whole country has been in turmoil. Our Committee has sent telegrams, offering earnest advice and devising three strategies on your behalf. Today, after reading your two telegrams from Jiangge, in which you stated your willingness to resign and go abroad, if you can truly retreat bravely, pull back from the brink, and put your words into practice to avoid causing chaos, we cannot help but celebrate the peace and unity for the Party, the country, and the people. The original intention of peace and unity is the basis for all work during the period of political tutelage. Without lasting peace, it is not enough to restore the vitality of society. Without true unity, it is not enough to promote national peace. Under this principle, the resurgence of feudal warlords must not be allowed. Since you have awakened, you have reopened the dawn for the situation. You must know that the earlier you step down, the sooner peace will be realized. The earlier you go abroad, the sooner unity will be established. This is why this Committee is sending another telegram to urge you, hoping that you will pack your bags and set off soon, without further hesitation. Parting words, please consider carefully. Shanghai Special City Executive Committee, Gray, Seal."</p>
<h3 id="e125">Steel Factory Director Zhou Zhihong Took Office Yesterday <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Factory is Scheduled to Resume Work on the 13th</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Military Affairs appointed Zhou Zhihong, Assistant Commissioner of the Ordnance Bureau, as the Director of the Shanghai Steel Factory, Zhou arrived in Shanghai and took office on the 9th. Yesterday morning, he handled the handover with various departments. At 2 PM, the entire factory's workers held a grand meeting to welcome and bid farewell to Directors Zhou and Hu. Among all the staff, only General Affairs Section Chief Yi Xiang and Engineering Section Chief Hu Sihong resigned on their own request; the others were not changed. Replacements have not yet been decided due to the reorganization period. It has now been decided that the factory will resume work first on the 13th. All 400+ employees will hold a welcome and farewell meeting at 2 PM this afternoon. Former Director Hu Shuhua and new Director Zhou Zhihong will both attend the meeting on time. After the ceremony, Chairman Chen Deheng will deliver a welcome and farewell speech, followed by speeches by Zhang Genbao, the representative of the Ordnance Factory Workers' Union, and Wang Fusheng, the representative of the 29th Branch of the First District. The meeting adjourned around 4 PM. The details of the process are recorded below:</p>
<p>Director Hu Shuhua's Address: Former Director Hu Shuhua's speech briefly stated, "I have been in charge of the steel factory twice, and now, due to financial difficulties and thorny issues, I am resigning halfway, which means that the planned expansion has not been implemented. As a result, some people say that the products of this factory are not as good as foreign goods, and the price is also expensive, so it is not worth running it. In the midst of this precarious situation, this factory is barely surviving. In the future, I hope that all employees, under the guidance of Director Zhou, will work harder and not give people cause for criticism. I am committed to the steel industry and aim to develop domestic production. Although I am leaving without achieving results this time, my spirit is always with this factory."</p>
<p>Director Zhou Zhihong's Address: The next speech was by the new Director Zhou Zhihong, who said, "The current situation of this factory is like a lonely boat on the ocean. Director Hu is the helmsman. Even in the midst of storms, he can still move forward. Now, I will continue to take up this helm, and I will proceed according to the plan originally set by Director Hu to reach the other shore. Only if all employees have the same spirit of sharing weal and woe and work diligently together can we achieve good results and live up to Director Hu's previous painstaking efforts."</p>

<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>wants to implement stamp tax in the French Concession. The problem has not been resolved between the two sides for a long time. It is reported that Director Huang Weiyue has commissioned Mr. Liu Chunpu and Mr. Shen Rulin as special commissioners for sales in the French Concession. Zheng Qimiao and other salesmen sent by the General Bureau will still be employed by Liu and Shen. After being commissioned, Liu and Shen set up an office in Zhenping Lane, Xiafei Road yesterday. At the same time, they sent a letter to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, specially informing French Consul General Gangerlin and the General Superintendent of the French Concession's Public Works Department.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Central Prison Delegation Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Afternoon Visit to the Detention Center of the Concession Court</p>
<p>Starting Today, Visit to the Public Concession Prison</p>
<p>An eighty-member delegation from the Central Army, Navy, and Air Force Prison Training Class, led by Director of Education Hu Zhikang, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 7:00 AM yesterday and stayed at the North Station Hotel. Around 10:00 AM, Director Hu Zhikang went to the Shanghai Office outside Fenglin Bridge to meet Director Chen Shiguang and Clerk Wang Lianzhai to discuss the details of the visit. After consultation between Director Chen and Xu Weizhen, President of the Provisional Court, it was decided that the entire detention center of the court would be visited first yesterday afternoon, and Clerk Miao Weny was assigned to accompany them. At 1:00 PM, the entire delegation arrived at the court and was received by representatives sent by President Xu to lead the tour, which ended at 4:00 PM. Starting today, they will visit the Public Concession Prison. Director Hu believed that since a large number of people were visiting Shanghai this time, if they followed the regulations of the Public Works Department, which only allowed two people to visit each day, the process would take too long. Therefore, he asked Director Chen to consult President Xu and forward the request to the Concession authorities for a more flexible arrangement, allowing visits in two shifts, morning and afternoon. The original letter stated: "We received a letter from the Central Army, Navy, and Air Force Prison Training Class, stating that the Headquarters Military Law Department approved a public letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the visit of your class's students to foreign prisons in Shanghai. We have already copied the original letter and sent it to you for your reference. Now, we have received another letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the Shanghai Office, based on information from the Provisional Court, will allow students to visit in shifts of six. We are responding accordingly and sending the original documents for your review. Please reply so that we can forward the response and inform them. The students of our class are scheduled to travel from Nanjing to Suzhou on the 6th of this month, and from Suzhou to Shanghai on the 8th. On the 10th and 11th, they will visit the foreign prisons and detention center of the Public Works Department in Shanghai. In addition to reporting this, we are writing to your office to request your assistance in making arrangements in advance and sending someone to guide them. We have previously received a reply from your court stating that students will be allowed to visit in shifts of six. This has been reported to the Ministry and forwarded. Now, Director Hu Zhikang of the training class is leading eighty students to Shanghai. If only six people are allowed to visit each day, it will take more than ten days to complete the visits for eighty people. Moreover, the visitors have other work in Nanjing and cannot stay for a long time, and staying in a hotel would be very costly. Could it be possible to arrange for visits in two shifts, morning and afternoon, with six people in each shift? In addition to our office assigning Clerk Miao Weny to accompany them, we are writing to request that you forward this request to the Public Works Department Prison and Detention Center for their consideration, to foster public goodwill."</p>

<p>Telegrams from All Parties Express Obedience to Central Government Orders</p>
<p>Our reporter visited Mayor Zhang Qun at the Municipal Government at 3:00 PM yesterday to inquire about the details of the central government's handling of the Fujian situation. Zhang stated that the central government's handling of the Fujian situation was entirely based on the measures he had telegraphed from Fujian earlier. On the 6th, the central government directly telegraphed Yang Shuzhuang, Lu Xingbang, and others, ordering them to release the arrested provincial committee members immediately and transfer them to Nanjing for interrogation. The Municipal Government recently received telegrams from Chairman Yang, Lu Xingbang, Lin Zhong, and others on the 8th, all stating that they would resolutely comply with the central government's orders and release the arrested provincial committee members to the provincial capital immediately. Secretary Guo Shihui also sent a telegram today reporting that the provincial committee members, including Lin Zhiyuan, would definitely be released to the province within a day or two. Zhang added that his negotiations in Fujian had been successful and that he would return to Shanghai within a few days. Therefore, the Fujian affair can be considered to have come to an end. He (Zhang referred to himself) was ordered to go to Fujian to investigate, and although Deputy Officer Li sacrificed his life, it was exchanged for the peace of Fujian and the maintenance of the central government's prestige. He stated that he was innocent both publicly and privately. Zhang's expression was joyful as he spoke, and he also said that he had reported the telegrams from all parties to Chairman Chiang.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Wang Jingqi's Opinions on the Far East Investigation Team <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>According to the Kuomin News Agency, the China Press published on March 6th about the opium situation in Anhui, and on March 9th, it published the opinions of the Far East Investigation Team, which has drawn great attention from people in the country. Minister Wang Jingqi, who struggled in the League of Nations Opium Prohibition Committee last year, is now in Shanghai. The reporter specially visited him to inquire about the real situation. According to Minister Wang, the Far East Investigation Team stated that the League of Nations could not accept the proposals of the Chinese delegation for two reasons. The first point was that China's request to send personnel to participate in the investigation team could not be accommodated by the League of Nations because if China was allowed to participate, other countries related to opium would also demand to participate. The second point was that China's request to investigate morphine at the same time should be handled by the newly established Central Supervisory Department of the League of Nations, so it could not be allowed. These two points are somewhat different from the facts. First, when the Council of the League of Nations was meeting, I did propose the idea of Chinese participation in the investigation team. Later, the general consensus was that personnel from countries not involved in opium should be engaged in the investigation. At that time, we stated that if the investigation team could expand the scope of investigation to other regions and items, our representative could suggest to the Chinese government to cancel the proposal of Chinese participation. Second, the Central Supervisory Department was not yet established at that time. Even if it had been established, the department was produced according to Chapter 7, Article 19 of the 1925 Geneva Convention, which China and the United States, who have suffered the most from foreign toxins, have not signed. Moreover, investigating morphine does not conflict with the duties entrusted to the Supervisory Department by the Convention, nor is it repetitive. For example, the team is now specifically investigating opium, which does not conflict with or repeat the Supervisory Department's duty to collect opium statistics according to Article 23 of the Convention. Therefore, based on this reason, abandoning morphine without investigation is really unsatisfactory to the Chinese people. At first, they opposed us, only saying that it was because it cost too much money and there were economic problems. That's why I said in Hangzhou on October 15th in a conversation with the Kuomin News Agency that "funding cannot be a problem, because the production of drugs is mostly in Europe, and transportation is convenient, arriving in the evening after departing in the morning, without spending too much money. Japan is the producer of drugs outside of Europe. Now that the Far East Investigation Team has arrived in the Far East, if they investigate the opium seedlings in Japan within the scope set by the meeting, it seems that they are clearly aware that Japan does not produce opium seedlings, and are just making a formal observation. As for the situation in which Japan produces a large amount of drugs, they are ignoring it, which really puzzles Chinese people who are enthusiastic about resisting drugs." But we hope that everyone understands that the Chinese people are in principle consistent with the League of Nations, only the methods are different. Fortunately, over the past year, all parties have become more aware of the harm of morphine and other products, and restriction measures will be drafted soon, which is very gratifying. As for the China Press reporter's statement that Chinese representatives said many face-saving words at the Geneva Opium Prohibition Conference, it is really not worth a smile. Such ridicule from reporters outside of China is really regrettable for us to hear. Chinese representatives at the International Opium Prohibition Conference have two roles: one domestic and one international. They themselves also know that due to various reasons of internal strife in the country, the disaster of opium has not yet been eradicated, which is a cause of infinite grief. Therefore, they have also expressed countless sincere opinions domestically. But no matter how severe the opium disaster is, it is only the Chinese harming themselves. We have not massacred people from other countries. We should do it ourselves. In the international arena, China has suffered harm from foreign toxins, which is evidenced. Chinese representatives, of course, cannot but rise up against the excessive production of morphine. That's why I said before that "if the country cannot use honest and sincere means to immediately prohibit opium, then we will only feel sorry for ourselves and can no longer resent others. This is a matter of China's own side. On the other hand, if foreigners do not restrict drug factories, do not comply with the Hague Convention, and still rely on the power of unequal treaties to harm our people at home and abroad with drugs, then foreigners are sorry to the Chinese people, and we cannot blame the Chinese people of today and tomorrow for being eternally heartbroken." Chinese diplomats' love for the country, truth, and justice is no less than that of any country. No matter what country a person is from, if they are in the position of representing China at the Opium Prohibition Conference, they cannot have a second attitude. In the past, when new Chinese diplomats wanted to protect China's sovereignty, they were not subjected to various attacks from foreigners. Unexpectedly, today, the attitude of the Chinese representative to the Opium Prohibition Committee has been directly damaging the personal dignity and indirectly damaging the prestige of the country he represents. But if the attitude of the Chinese representative can awaken the world to the harm of foreign toxins to China and to our Asian nations, we ourselves are also very honored. The above is my personal opinion, but I think the views of the Chinese government and the people of the whole country will not differ much.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Silk Industry Improves Silk Packaging and Silk Unpacking Procedures <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Effective April 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Mill Association has discussed and finalized measures to improve silk packaging and silk unpacking procedures. Yesterday, it sent letters to various silk mills, requesting them to take note and implement the measures. The letter stated: "Our silk mill colleagues have traditionally used oil paper and white sheets to wrap silk packages, with a thin hemp bag as the outer layer, tied with ropes. This method is not only wasteful but also fails to show proper respect. Based on the meeting of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Mill Industry Association, we have formulated improved measures for silk unpacking procedures and silk packaging. Starting from April 1st, all silk packages will be replaced with new-style canvas bags. All hemp bags, ropes, oil paper, etc., should be abolished immediately. To prevent theft along the way, German steel pliers will be used to crimp lead seals. In the future, when silk is sent to the raw silk inspection office for inspection, only silk packages with intact lead seals will be accepted. Therefore, the improvement of silk packaging and silk unpacking procedures is essential. All our colleagues should prepare early to avoid being caught unprepared. If colleagues are unsure about the style of the canvas bags or where to purchase steel pliers and lead seals, the association has samples available for viewing. We can also assist with purchasing. German lead-sealing steel pliers, including engraving of Chinese and Western factory names, cost $8.50 each, and canvas bags cost $5.00 each. When entrusting us with purchasing, please send a list of the factory name and the number of canvas bags needed as soon as possible. As for the silk unpacking procedures, we would like to reiterate the following points, and we hope you will take note: Silk unpacking procedures: (1) When packing silk, first pack fifteen bundles of silk into the usual cloth bag, then place it into a standard canvas bag. (2) After packing, fasten the two straps of the canvas bag and insert lead wool through the holes under the copper fastener, then crimp the lead seal. (3) When unpacking silk, factory staff and the godown staff should send the silk to the foreign firm's godown and remove the lead seal on the spot to wait. After the samples are drawn, refasten and crimp the seal. (4) After the silk has passed the foreign firm's inspection, the foreign firm will notify the factory by telephone to send staff to the firm to open the seal for inspection. If there are no errors, refasten and crimp the seal according to the previous method, and allow the foreign firm to transfer it to the raw silk inspection office for public measurement. The procedures will be handled by the foreign firm. (5) The raw silk inspection office will inspect the silk packages sent by the foreign firm to see if the lead seals of the manufacturer are intact. If they are, they will be accepted; otherwise, they will be rejected. (6) After the public measurement is completed, the silk will be sent back to the foreign firm by the raw silk inspection office. The canvas bag and the samples will be retrieved by the factory's staff from the foreign firm. Since raw silk is inspected and publicly measured by both the foreign firm and the raw silk inspection office, to and from, to avoid danger in transit, all have theft insurance in accordance with the insurance regulations. If the silk package is not intact and the seal is not complete, the insurance company will not be responsible. Therefore, improving the silk package and adding a lead seal are necessary procedures after the implementation of public measurement. Please pay attention. Shanghai Silk Mill Association Committee."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday regarding the urgent resolution of the Jiangsu Province post-war public debt: "In the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), the former General Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers Association, and the Money Shops Association jointly presented to the government that the Jiangsu Province post-war public debt had been in arrears for a long time. They requested that the increased price of salt in the five Huainan prefectures, which was changed to donations in the 15th year of the Republic of China (1926), be used as the fund for guaranteeing the principal and interest of the debt. After the loans borrowed by the financial circles of Yangzi and Shanghai are repaid, a new list of extended repayment periods will be created, and the doubled revenue will be stored separately in a special account. Following the example of treasury bonds, a committee will be established to manage the funds, so as to gradually repay the outstanding principal and interest, so as to demonstrate creditworthiness. On March 23rd of that year, the government issued Directive No. 413, stating that the matter had been noted and requested that the Finance Department review and forward it for further examination. To date, two years have passed, and no further instructions have been received. Bondholders have repeatedly questioned the matter at the association, and they believe that the debt with a specified fund and the debt without security should be included in the scope of resolution. Since the issuance of the debt, interest has only been paid once, and bondholders have suffered significant losses. Public debt issued in Zhejiang Province has been paid in full, principal and interest, in proportion to the amount of the debt. Jiangsu and Zhejiang are adjacent, and the measures should not be different. Please forward the request for a method to maintain the creditworthiness and avoid prolonged delays. The Shanghai Special Municipality Business Organization Rectification Committee humbly requests your consideration."</p>

<p>Demanding Compensation of One Million Yuan in Losses</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's New Kang ship was sunk by the Japanese Mail Steamship Company's Ryuno Maru in Shandong last year. After repeated negotiations, no progress was made. The company has now obtained approval from the Ministry of Communications to file a lawsuit demanding compensation of one million yuan in losses. The venue for the lawsuit has also been approved by the ministry to be the Shanghai Provisional Court. The Ministry of Communications has sent a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, notifying the Japanese side to appear in court for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Compilation of Merchant Ship Accidents <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>He Lun Collides with Japanese Ship. Recently, Shanghai's cargo volume has been abnormally congested, and the shipping companies in Shanghai are competing to dispatch ships for loading. The Japanese ship Shimizu Maru of the American-owned Meishun Foreign Company in Shanghai loaded a large number of goods and was transporting them to Tianjin. On the morning of the previous day, when it was sailing near Gaoqiao Sand on the Huangpu River, a Dutch merchant ship, the Qimi, which was transporting goods from Europe to Shanghai, suddenly came head-on and entered the same line as the Japanese ship. At this time, the tide was rushing, and the Japanese ship Shimizu Maru tried to avoid it, but it was too late, causing the Shimizu Maru's bow cabin to be violently hit by the Dutch ship. A hole was knocked into the cargo hold of the Japanese ship, and seawater immediately rushed into the cabin. The ship's bow sank. The shipowner was shocked and, fearing that the entire ship would sink, immediately ordered the driver to drive fast and ground the Shimizu Maru on a shoal. He then urgently hired barges to unload all the ship's cargo ashore, and then repaired the damaged area. As for the Dutch ship, only the bow suffered minor damage.</p>
<p>Salvage of the Feichu Ship. The Feichu ship of the Sanbei Company was violently hit by the Jiangzhen military cabin ship, which was going downstream from Turtle Mountain, at noon on the 24th of last month at the Hankou riverfront. The Feichu ship was immediately broken and sank into the river. The Shanghai headquarters sent Chief Shipowner Paos to Hankou to inspect whether it could be salvaged. Yesterday, Paos returned to Shanghai and reported to the company that the Feichu could be salvaged. Therefore, yesterday, the Sanbei Company sent six technicians and a batch of workers, along with water pumps, etc., from Shanghai to Beijing, and then transferred to Hankou to carry out salvage work.</p>
<p>Rescue of the Baling Maru. The Baling Maru, a direct north-south liner of the Nisshin Company, encountered a reef in the waters off Nanao Island, east of Shantou, on February 28th while traveling from Guangdong to Shanghai. The Japanese warship Kaki, stationed in Shantou, immediately sailed to Nanao and sent a platoon of navy to protect the Baling Maru. The area near Nanao is a den of pirates. On the third day of the Baling's accident, a group of pirates plotted to rob the ship but were repelled by the Japanese navy. The passengers inside the ship have been transferred by the company's Lushan Maru to the shores of Shantou and Guangdong. The cargo is still trapped in the cabins. According to a telegram from the chief shipowner who went to the rescue, the seabed reef is fortunately flat, so the ship's hull has not been broken. The holes in the first and second cabins have been patched with cement, and water is currently being pumped out. Once the accumulated water is pumped out and the cement dries, it can be towed back. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai within about three weeks.</p>

<p>Effective from the 17th</p>
<p>The shipping companies on the Yangtze River and along the coast, including China Merchants, Sanbei, Hongan, Jardine Matheson, Taikoo, and Nisshin, have unanimously decided to increase freight rates on all Yangtze River routes by 15% starting from the 17th of this month due to the soaring gold prices affecting costs. For other routes to Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangdong, the increase varies by company, but it is approximately 10%. Merchants have been notified of this yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Notification of Increased Insurance Premiums for Merchant Ships During Military Use <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Shipping Association sent a letter to its member shipping companies yesterday, stating: "Regarding the issue of increased insurance premiums for ships during military use, the Insurance Association has repeatedly sent letters to inform us, and this association has replied with amendments in accordance with the resolutions of the previous executive and supervisory committee meetings. The issue has been basically resolved. Here is a summary of the correspondence between the Insurance Association and this association: (1) The Insurance Association's letter on January 16 stated that if ships do not increase insurance premiums according to the newly set rate (0.35% per month, 0.50% for three months, 0.75% for six months, 1% per year) during military use, the insurance policy will be suspended. If no notification was given at the time, the premium cannot be refunded. (2) This association replied on January 23 in accordance with the resolution of the second joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, stating that the annual premium should be calculated at 1%, with each month as a unit. For example, if military use is less than one month, it will also be calculated as one month, and if it is more than one month, it will be calculated on a daily basis. (3) The Insurance Association's letter on February 22 stated that the proposed increase in insurance premiums was indeed necessary due to the excessive risks of military chartering and requisition, and the increase was necessary to compensate for the risks. They could not agree with the annual increase of 1%. (4) On March 3, this association replied in accordance with the resolution of the third executive committee meeting, agreeing to change the insurance period to units of three months (i.e., additional insurance must be for three months at a time, and if the period expires and continued insurance is needed, it must still be for three months, and so on). The premium will be fixed at 2.5 yuan per hundred taels. (5) The Insurance Association's letter on March 7 stated that the measures described in this association's letter of March 3 had been submitted to the meeting on March 6, and it was resolved to temporarily follow the procedures. We hope that you will understand the past and know the results, and that in the future, if your company's ships are requisitioned for military use, you should declare the military use to the original insurance company of the ship in accordance with the measures resolved by the third executive and supervisory committee meeting of this association and pay the additional insurance premium on time to be prepared. We hope that you will pay attention to this matter."</p>

Notices have been sent to the established provincial and regional federations of commerce, special municipality chambers of commerce, and overseas Chinese chambers of commerce for their information and implementation.

However, since there are still more than three months before the date of the members' general meeting, if the federation of commerce in your province and the chamber of commerce in your special municipality are formally organized and established before the general meeting, they can select member representatives to attend the meeting in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce Law and the rules of the members' general meeting. We are enclosing the original telegram and rules for your reference. We hope that you will immediately convene the members' general meeting in your respective provinces and cities to organize and establish the federation of commerce in your respective provinces and the chamber of commerce in your respective special municipalities in accordance with the law, and submit a letter for filing separately. At the same time, select member representatives in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce Law and the rules of the members' general meeting to attend the meeting on time.

<h3 id="e141">Yesterday Morning, Robbery and Gunfire in the Eight Immortals Bridge Area <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Ma Hongji's Residence on Wehrman Road</p>
<p>Eight Robbers Suddenly Arrived Early in the Morning</p>
<p>The Owner Was Handsome, and the Robbers Coveted Riches</p>
<p>One Robber Killed, One Wounded, One Policeman Wounded</p>
<p>At 7:30 yesterday morning, a major robbery suddenly occurred at the residence of the late Ma Fuqi, a native of Chuansha, at No. 183 Wehrman Road in the French Concession. Two robbers opened fire to resist arrest and were killed on the spot. A policeman was seriously wounded. Both sides fired over thirty shots, and a stray bullet grazed an old woman. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Eight robbers came to the residence of the late Ma Fuqi, a native of Chuansha, at No. 183 Wehrman Road in the French Concession. Ma was formerly a contractor for the cleaning department of the Chinese and foreign concessions. His business, named Ma Hongji, was quite wealthy and owned a great deal of real estate, making him a target for robbers for a long time. At 7:30 yesterday morning, while the maidservant went out to fetch water, eight robbers suddenly rushed in through the front door. They were all around thirty years old, of medium build, and spoke with a northern accent. Four of the robbers were armed with pistols and threatened everyone into silence. After entering the house, they stationed themselves at the door and in the reception hall to keep watch. The other four robbers hurriedly went upstairs, first taking the key to pry open the door of Ma's wife's (also known as Sister Agui) room. Upon opening it, they found the room empty (because Ma's wife had moved out and lived with her second son).</p>
<p>The robbers searched recklessly, and seeing that Ma's wife's room was empty, they then broke into the bedroom of Ma's eldest son, Ma Hongkui. They told the owner that they were short of funds and asked to borrow 500 yuan from him. Ma Hongkui replied, "Okay, but you must not lay a hand on me." After saying this, he took the key and retrieved the silver dollars from the iron safe as requested, handing them over to the robbers. Unexpectedly, the robbers were still not satisfied and began rummaging through the boxes and chests. They stole 1,500 yuan in silver dollars and 750 yuan in banknotes from the iron safe. They also stole a fox-trimmed fur robe, a white sheepskin robe, a gray satin-backed leather vest, and a copper basin hat from the clothes chest. They also snatched a gold watch and chain from Ma. Ma said to the robbers, "Since you have taken the silver dollars, you cannot take any more items." Upon hearing this, the robbers threw the gold watch back and snatched 35 yuan in banknotes and silver dollars from Ma's servant. Each robber hid the loot on their person and took off their own clothes, putting on the stolen fox-trimmed fur robes and other items before rushing out the door and fleeing.</p>
<p>The robbers resisted arrest along the way, fully laden with loot, and fled out the door. Six robbers ran south, while two robbers with guns covered their retreat. One robber wore a fox fur robe over a long gray-white cloth gown and a dark-colored vest, while the other wore a gray cloth robe. Unexpectedly, a servant named Qiao had already escaped and secretly reported the robbery to the police station at No. 309 nearby. When the robbers fled, Qiao and the police officer quietly followed behind. The two robbers with guns initially fled north into Kédì Road and headed straight east. When they looked back and saw someone following them, they immediately opened fire and fled. When they reached the intersection of Mintini Road, the two robbers fled north again. At this time, police officers from Nos. 398, 314, and other police stations rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and joined in the pursuit.</p>
<p>One robber was killed on the spot when the police sirens blared and the detectives gathered. One robber seized the opportunity to run into the YMCA building opposite Shou'an Lane on Mintini Road. The robber wearing the fox fur coat hid inside the construction site. Police officers from Nos. 398 and 31 followed in pursuit and fired a shot at the robber upon entering the site, but missed. The robber quickly ran around a pile of soil and fled to the base of the south short wall. As he was about to climb over the wall after removing his fox fur coat, the two police officers fired three shots in a row, but still missed. The robber, feeling hopeless, stood still, raised both hands, and at the same time, another bullet arrived, hitting his left chest fatally. He fell to the ground and died. A six-inch Browning pistol and 400 yuan in stolen money (all Zhejiang Industrial Bank banknotes) were found on the ground. The dead robber was then dragged out by the construction workers on the site and taken to the morgue by the staff of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to await examination. During the resistance, there were more than a dozen construction workers on the site, all of whom heard the sound and fled to avoid being hurt. Fortunately, no innocent people were injured.</p>
<p>One robber committed suicide at the same time. Another robber, armed and wearing a gray robe, fled west into Wagner Road. The police officer from No. 309 relentlessly pursued him. When he reached the entrance of the Weimei Sauce Garden at No. 29, the robber suddenly fell to the ground. The police officer from No. 309 was already very close. The robber quickly raised his hand and fired a shot, hitting the police officer in the left shoulder, causing him to fall to the ground in pain. The robber, knowing that he could not escape, turned the gun and fired a shot at his own head, piercing the back of his head. Blood flowed like a river, and he fell to the ground unconscious. The detectives who arrived at the scene checked and found that he was not yet dead. They immediately sent him and the police officer to the Guangci Hospital on Kim Shenfu Road for treatment. It was reported that the robber's injuries were very serious and he was in critical condition. The police officer, although seriously injured, was not in life-threatening danger.</p>
<p>Bullet marks were everywhere. During the resistance along the way, both sides fired over thirty shots, leaving bullet marks everywhere they passed. According to a detailed investigation, a piece of glass was broken on the south-facing window of No. 44 Mintini Road, and a hole was created on the cement floor in front of No. 46. A piece of glass was destroyed on the west-facing window of the Hengfaxiang Rice Store at No. 7 Wagner Road. A stray bullet grazed the forehead of Bao Chenshi, an old woman from Ningbo (75 years old) in front of the Lishunxing Cotton Store on the second floor at No. 44, who was later sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It was reported that the injury was very minor. As for the south side of the YMCA, there were many bullet holes and obvious bullet marks.</p>
<p>A detailed investigation was conducted after the incident. The police station learned that the patrol chief immediately ordered detectives to investigate the owner's house and the construction site of the YMCA. In the owner's house, they found the long clothes that the robbers had taken off. They also found the stolen fox fur coat on the road. Two pistols were also found near the robber's body. They took everything back to the police station. On the one hand, the police station ordered detectives to send the injured police officer and Bao to the hospital for treatment separately. On the other hand, the robber's body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall morgue. In the afternoon, the Criminal Division of the French Police Station reported to the French Court. At 2:30, Judge Zhu of the court came to the morgue to examine the body of the unnamed robber and confirmed that he had died from gunshot wounds while resisting arrest. He ordered that photos be taken and the body be collected by the court. On the one hand, the patrol chief ordered all patrolmen to pay close attention and strictly investigate the robbers to bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Wang, a Sixty-Year-Old Unmarried Woman</p>
<p>Said to the Judge, "Have the Virtue of Preserving Life"</p>
<p>The Judge Said, "It's Too Late to Regret"</p>
<p>"It's Difficult to Avoid Punishment Even if You Say Good Things"</p>
<p>The Bao Patrolman of the Laozha Police Station in the Public Concession, after arresting counterfeit banknote criminals, discovered that the organization was located in the Shenjiahang and Zhaojiahang areas of Jiangwan. He then joined detectives from the Public Security Bureau to go to Jiangwan, where they separately cracked the cases. They found four machines in the cellars, as well as printing plates and 30,000 to 40,000 yuan in counterfeit banknotes. They immediately arrested the landlords Shen Ada, Shen Lu, Wang, Wang Zhao, and others, and brought them to the Provisional Court. The Municipal Public Security Bureau then sent detectives to escort them back and transferred them to the Local Court. The prosecutor has filed a public prosecution, citing the crime of counterfeiting currency. Yesterday morning at 10:00, Judge Shen Bingle opened the court to hear the case. The statements of each person are as follows:</p>
<p>Shen Ada The defendant Shen Ada testified that he was from Baoshan, lived in Shenjiahang, Jiangwan, and made a living selling vegetables. "I rent out my house, and I don't know anything about it. My wife, Shen, is in charge." (Asked) "Does the local security chief Shen Maoqing know?" (Answered) "I don't know." (Asked) "Have you received the rent?" (Answered) "Not yet." (Asked) "After it was printed, how much money did you make?" (Answered) "I don't know." (Asked) "How far is Zhaojiahang from your house?" (Answered) "About ten miles." (Asked) "Does the Wang family know? Is it the first time or the second time?" (Answered) "The second time." (Asked) "Have you ever used the counterfeit banknotes?" (Answered) "I haven't."</p>
<p>Shen Lu Shen Lu testified that she was 47 years old, lived in Shenjiahang, Jiangwan, and made a living farming. "I have seven children at home and ask for leniency. Duan Rongsheng and Shi Xingsheng rented my house. At that time, they said they were opening a machine noodle shop. Later, after three days, I asked them why they didn't make noodles. They said they were printing card posts. They came to me to rent the house on the fourth day of the twelfth month. They came again after three or four days." (Asked) "Do you recognize Duan Rongsheng?" (Answered) "He sells firewood in Jiangwan." (Asked) "How much rent is it per room?" (Answered) "Ten yuan a month.

(Answered) "Shen Taosheng talked about it first, but later Shen didn't come." (Asked) "Is your house in the countryside?" (Answered) "It's north of Jiangwan." (Asked) "Do you think a house north of Jiangwan would cost 20 yuan a month? Wouldn't it be a loss to open a shop? When were you arrested?" (Answered) "December 23. Shi Xingsheng himself led the Bao Patrolman to arrest people. I explained the situation at that time, saying that I wanted to go to the court and go with Shi together, and not let him go.

(Asked) "Who rented the house?" (Answered) "Zhou Jinfu rented it. Zhou has been released by the Public Security Bureau. We are suffering." (Asked) "Did Zhou come alone, or did several people come?"

(Answered) "These two people were released by the master (referring to the prosecutor) below. Please, sir, let me go. I won't rent it to anyone in the future. You have the virtue of preserving life." The official said, "It's too late to regret. I can't exempt you from punishment just because you said a few good words. It's your own fault."</p>

(Asked) "Country people only live a few miles away from their mothers' house. Even if there is nothing to do at home, how could you live there for three or four days? This kind of testimony is unreasonable. How did the banknotes in your room come about?" (Answered) "The Bao Patrolman bit me." (Asked) "There are 28,000 yuan in banknotes in your room. They were made outside and hidden in your room. How many children do you have?" (Answered) "Two." (Asked) "What about the child you gave birth to?" (Answered) "I was arrested nineteen days after I gave birth to him. I don't know what's going on now." The official said, "You were arrested on December 23. The child was already nineteen days old, which clearly means that you were not at your mother's house. It is clear that you are talking nonsense, seeking only small profits and not considering the harm."</p>
<p>Han Jinxiang At this point, Han Jin, a detective from the Public Security Bureau, testified that he was 28 years old and from Anhui. "This case was entrusted to us by You A'gen, the head of the Laozha Police Station. On the first day, we arrested a machine at Shenjiahang.

(Answered) "Yes." (Asked) "How did you release him?" (Answered) "We didn't release him. After we arrested him at that time, we buried him in the fifth section of the fifth district. The police station took him away. Then we went to Zhaojiahang and found a machine in No. 25. Then we found two machines in the cellar at No. 22. The cellar was covered with straw. Because the grass was really moving, we opened it up. It was a total of 14 feet deep and as wide as a room. We copied out more than 30,000 banknotes and also some silver coins. They were copied from Wang Zhao's room." (Asked) "Then Duan Rongsheng, Shi Xingsheng, etc., have been released?" (Answered) "It was handled by the concession." The interrogating official, in order to clarify the situation, instructed that he would personally conduct an on-site inspection and investigation before proceeding with the trial. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the March 8th Women's Day, the youths arrested by the Public Concession police at Nanjing Road, Fujian Road, and North Shanxi Road Bridge were all sent to the Provisional Court yesterday morning, and the police lawyers filed separate charges. Among them were Lu Jinchu from Hubei, Zeng Baideng from Anhui, and Sun Shuguang from Fujian, all of whom were charged with distributing reactionary flyers and shouting reactionary slogans. After questioning by Judge Gao, Lu and Cao were each sentenced to three months in prison. Sun was acquitted due to insufficient evidence of the crime. In addition, Fan Mingsheng from Guizhou was charged with carrying reactionary flyers with the intention of distributing them. After the trial was concluded, he was sentenced to six months in prison. Furthermore, Ye Ying from Fujian was charged with smashing a piece of glass on the No. 216 trolleybus of the British-American Tramway Company on Fujian Road with a stone, worth 5 yuan and 5 jiao. As a result, Judge Gao sentenced him to one year and six months in prison. Wang Wu from Guangxi was also charged with hiding reactionary flyers with the intention of distributing them. After questioning by Judge Tan, he was leniently sentenced to three months in prison. When Ye Ying was brought to the court, everyone paid attention. The buttons of his long gown were usually on the right side of the gown, but Ye's were on the left side. Therefore, the police lawyer requested the judge to pay attention to his clothing, saying that Ye's wearing such an abnormal dress actually contained the meaning that he was a leftist.</p>

<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has been conducting registration of well-drilling companies in accordance with the city's water supply rules since September of last year. It was found that the Zhonghua Well-Drilling Bureau has been operating in the urban area. The registration notice was sent to them, and a letter was also sent urging them to register. However, the company delayed and ignored the notice. The registration deadline has long passed, but they still have not complied with the regulations. Recently, the bureau sent personnel to investigate and found that the company was still operating with a county license. The accountant of the company, Ma Shunong, personally endorsed the company's articles of association with the address of the previous workplace. The police from the Second Sub-District of the First District of the Public Security Bureau were requested to detain the accountant. The bureau believes that the company's refusal to register and its unauthorized operation in the city are deliberate violations of the regulations. Therefore, it sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau requesting that it be dealt with in accordance with the regulations. If the company wants to continue operating in the city after paying the fine, it must be ordered to pay a deposit to the Bureau of Public Utilities to complete the registration and then be refunded.</p>

<p>Han Fengjiang from Shandong, 41 years old, moved to No. 2 in the vicinity of the Qichang Stack Foundry in Pudong around July or August last year. He had no wife, and the four people living with him at home were his brothers and nephews. Han had no permanent occupation. His daily life depended on lending money at high interest. The night before last, Han's four family members were playing at the neighbor's house and had not returned. Han was left alone at home. At 11:00 p.m., three robbers suddenly came. One robber was armed with a pistol. At that time, Han's door was not bolted. The robbers rushed in, pulled out their pistols, and forbade Han from making any noise. They then searched for loot and stole a total of 52 yuan in cash, 26,000 copper coins, a fake wool crepe mandarin jacket, a felt hat, and a pair of straight wool crepe shoes. They fled out with the loot. Han, witnessing the scene, was heartbroken and shouted "Catch the robbers!" This angered the robbers, who raised their guns at Han's body and said, "I'll send you off!" After saying this, he pulled the trigger and fired. There was a loud bang, and Han's left leg was hit. The bullet was deeply embedded and did not come out. Han fell to the ground after being injured, bleeding profusely. When his family members heard the gunshots and rushed over, they saw what had happened and immediately reported the matter to the Third District Police Station and requested an arrest. Patrol Chief Shen of the police station supervised the police to rush to the scene to pursue the robbers, but the robbers had already gone far away. He then helped Han's family members carry him to the Pudong Hospital for treatment. However, because the bullet had not penetrated and the hospital was not equipped with bullet-extraction instruments, he was transferred to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Zhou Qinzhen, a woman from No. 3 Zhongxing Lane, Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, recently hired lawyer Yuan Jingtang to file a divorce lawsuit with the Local Court. She stated that she had married Xi Zhongfang and had four children. However, her husband neglected to provide for her, so she had no choice but to request a divorce and to request the return of the clothes and accessories taken by the defendant. She also stated that after marrying into the family in the past, she learned that the defendant was addicted to wandering and did not engage in proper business. He stayed in brothels and gambling dens all day long, neglecting his family affairs. He also smoked opium and violated the prohibited regulations. After living together for several years, she suffered all kinds of hardships and blamed her fate for meeting the wrong person. She could only endure the pain and bitterness and hope that he would change his ways and start anew. Therefore, she worked to provide for the family. Recently, he became even more excessive, secretly cohabiting with a prostitute and producing an illegitimate child. He pawned all her clothes and accessories to provide for his mistress. Such a family was no different from hell. On October 21 of last year, the defendant was willing to vow to repent, but before the ink was dry, he became even more absurd than before, wanting to push the plaintiff into an abyss of suffering from which she could never recover. Knowing that the defendant would never repent, she would never escape the sea of ​​suffering. Having such a husband, how could she grow old together? Therefore, she pleaded to be granted a divorce in order to save herself from the dire situation. A court hearing was held, and the official ordered an out-of-court settlement. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu held another court hearing. The plaintiff briefly stated the previous situation and also stated that the defendant was willing to pay 30 yuan per month, but that was just talk. The defendant Xi Zhongfang testified that he was 31 years old, from Shanghai, and engaged in the cotton yarn business, living at No. 64 Qipu Road. He stated that he was willing to pay 30 yuan per month. The defendant's father, Xi Renzhang, testified that Xi Zhongfang was his son and that he and his daughter-in-law had always been on good terms. The son and daughter-in-law had moved out to live separately for several years. The interrogating official then asked prosecutor Li to come to the court to express his opinion. The interrogating official then instructed that the debate be concluded and that a verdict be issued on the 14th. The court was then adjourned.</p>

<p>Shi Dianchun, a native of Jianxinghua, 34 years old, made a living by farming in his hometown. He had a daughter named Long Yingzi, 15 years old, who was quite beautiful. Having long heard of the prosperity of Shanghai, he planned to visit. On the 20th of last month, he took his daughter by boat to Shanghai and stayed at the home of his friend Luo Tianbang. Luo was also from Xinghua and ran a pancake shop at No. 41 Xin Street in the Nanshi area. Luo had a younger brother named San Daizi (Three-Stupid), who was 32 years old and worked as a porter on the docks. Seeing Long Yingzi's beauty, San Daizi suggested to Shi that he marry her off to a friend. Shi refused. On the 2nd of this month, Luo and his brother San Daizi suddenly invited Shi Dianchun to go sightseeing along the Huangpu River. They said that it was inconvenient to bring Long Yingzi along because she was a young girl, so they should leave her there. Shi agreed. After the three of them left, San Daizi suddenly said he had urgent business and had to go to a friend's house, so they parted ways. Around 5 p.m., Luo Tianbang and Shi Dianchun returned from their outing, only to find San Daizi sitting at home alone. Long Yingzi was nowhere to be found. They urgently asked San Daizi, who feigned ignorance. Shi was extremely anxious about his missing daughter and searched everywhere for days without success. Until yesterday, someone told him that the Luo brothers had deliberately deceived him because he was a naive villager. They had tricked him into leaving first, then San Daizi returned home under the pretext of having an errand, lured his daughter out, and sold her off. Shi was furious upon hearing this and immediately turned the Luo brothers over to police officer Cheng Jie at the 31st guard post. They were taken back to the 1st Precinct, 1st Substation, and temporarily detained to await a clear investigation and further handling.</p>

<p>Chen Zhongkang, 19 years old, a local, runs a Lukaochien meat shop in Dongjiadu, Nanshi. Yesterday around 5 p.m., a girl, about 10 years old, came to the shop and said that the Wang family at Dashenchang Cigarette Paper Shop at the corner asked her to invite him over for lunch. Chen, hearing this, remembered that Dashenchang was indeed an acquaintance, but he had never seen this young girl before, so he was suspicious and politely declined. The girl lingered in the shop for a good while before leaving without saying goodbye. Chen noticed that eight silver dollars on the counter had disappeared. Knowing that the young girl had stolen them while he was distracted, he immediately chased after her and grabbed her. He searched her and found the stolen money. Considering her young age, he let her go. When Chen returned to the shop and counted the money, he found that one dollar was missing. He chased after her again, but the girl had already taken a rickshaw heading north. When she reached near Wangjia Wharf, the girl looked back and saw someone chasing her. Realizing something was wrong, she got out of the rickshaw and reported to police officer Chen Kesui at the 5th guard post that someone was stalking her. The police officer, acting on the report, detained Chen Zhongkang. After learning the facts, the girl took out the remaining stolen dollar from her shoe and gave it to the police officer, begging him to let her go. The officer refused and took both of them to the 1st Precinct, 1st Substation. During preliminary questioning by the station chief, the girl identified herself as Wu A'mei, 15 years old, from Tongzhou. Her father's name was Zengfu, and he ran the Wansheng Teahouse outside the Ximen (West Gate) of Shanghai. She said, "My father loves me very much and sent me to school for many years. However, in recent years, my father suddenly began to mistreat me. Two years ago, I lost two gold earrings, and he ended up kicking me out. I had no choice but to stay with my aunt in Yangsi Bridge, Pudong. Today, I crossed the river to Puxi for a walk. I met a local named Shen Rurong in Xiaonanmen. He was an acquaintance because he often drank tea at my family's teahouse. Shen instructed me to use this method to steal silver dollars from the meat shop." The station chief ordered that she be temporarily detained for investigation and further handling.</p>

Ye, hating Jiang for having an affair with his wife Chen, broke into house number 1107 on Yangzhou Road with a knife at noon on the 20th of this month and slashed Jiang's head. Jiang reported this to the Yangshupu Police Station, who detained Ye and sent him to the Provisional Court. Ye also accused Jiang of adultery with his wife Chen.

Now that Jiang had recovered and was present, he was in the defendant's position regarding the adultery case. The court instructed Jiang Youde to stand in the defendant's box. Jiang testified that he had begun an affair with Chen last summer. At that time, Chen had repeatedly told him that she had been abused by her husband and was about to be killed. She wanted to return to her mother's home but had no one to support her. Therefore, she decided to choose an honest person to maintain her livelihood. Since he was having an affair with her, on the 2nd of this month, Ye came to his house. He was having lunch when Ye, without saying a word, pulled out a kitchen knife and slashed his head.

<p>Brother's Widow Flees to Shanghai and Lives with Another Man</p>
<p>Major Conflict Ensues En Route</p>
<p>Li Ruzhang from Yancheng was nearly thirty but still unmarried. He farmed in his hometown and made a sufficient living. His younger brother Rubing met a woman with the surname He, a fellow native, last winter. She was twenty-nine years old and quite beautiful. Their love reached a boiling point, and they wished to spend their lives together. They married this spring and were extremely affectionate after their union. However, beauty is fleeting. Rubing soon fell ill and died. His wife, widowed at a young age, was devastated and considered remarrying after the mourning period. Unexpectedly, Ruzhang had evil intentions and wanted to take his brother's widow as his own wife. He arranged a hasty marriage ceremony. He swore she would not follow, seized an opportunity, and fled to Shanghai overnight. She soon met a rickshaw puller named Dong and rented a thatched house behind Guangzhao Road in Zhabei, living together as husband and wife. However, Li Ruzhang, unable to fulfill his desire, was extremely resentful. He took a car to Shanghai a few days ago, intending to find his brother's widow and take her back to his hometown to force her to be his wife. Yesterday, he visited the end of Hengtong Road and caught sight of Ms. He shopping in a nearby store. Overjoyed, he stepped forward, grabbed her, and forced her to return home. Unexpectedly, Ms. He shouted for help. A patrol officer heard the commotion and came to investigate. After learning the facts, he took them to the 4th District, 2nd Substation. The director questioned them. Li Ruzhang stated that the woman was his wedded wife and that she had eloped to Shanghai with another man. He asked for permission to take her back to his hometown. Ms. He stated that the older brother of her deceased husband wanted her to be his wife, but she refused and ran away. She was now living with Dong and would rather die than go with him. The judge ordered them to be sent to the Judicial Section for review.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Embezzlement of Silver Dollars Through Forged Accounts <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Initial Trial Verdict: Suspended Sentence</p>
<p>Plaintiff Appeals</p>
<p>Xiong Yuanchou from Jiangbei, who worked as an accounting clerk at the Securities and Goods Exchange at No. 1 Sichuan Road, falsely created accounts from January to December last year. Using fraudulent means, he had the managing director sign them, then withdrew money from the bank for his own use. The head of the department, Chen Gongbo, discovered this and hired lawyer Zhu Sifu to sue him in the Provisional Court. The presiding judge, after investigation, sentenced Xiong to six months in prison, suspended for three years, and ordered him to repay the plaintiff 4,982 taels and 95 cents of silver and 3,869 yuan and 70 cents in silver dollars. The plaintiff was dissatisfied with the verdict and hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file an appeal. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiu of the Court of Appeals, along with judges Shen and Li, held a joint hearing. First, the appellant's representative, lawyer Chen, stated the grounds for the appeal, saying that embezzlement was easier than theft and that leniency would not serve as a warning. Therefore, the suspended sentence was inappropriate. The defendant, Xiong Yuanchou, admitted to forging accounts, issuing checks, and taking silver dollars for his own use. Judge Qiu, considering the need for a detailed investigation of the case, ordered the defendant to post a 5,000-yuan bond to be released and to assist the plaintiff in investigating the accounts. The case was postponed for further hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e185">The Amazing Skill of an Apprentice at a Money Shop <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Holding Buddha</p>
<p>I once read "Supplemental Notes on Martial Arts" by Qian Jibo of Liangxi. It said that a tutor hung a sandbag in his doorway and pushed it every time he passed. Later, he used his palm to push people, and they would fall several feet away. This was the result of long practice. A guest told me about an apprentice at a money shop in Yuhang, which was quite similar to the tutor's story. This shows that learning martial arts does not necessarily require guidance from a master. A Daoist priest came to a certain money shop in Yuhang City. He was tall and sturdy, with a thick beard and an aquiline nose. His voice was like a bell, and his eyes were bright as lightning. He carried a shovel at his side and placed his alms bowl on the counter. When given copper coins, he closed his eyes and shook his head, not even glancing at them. He demanded more, doubling the amount, but still he was not satisfied. He stubbornly argued and clamored endlessly. At that moment, there happened to be an apprentice who had gathered tens of thousands of copper coins on a wooden board to prepare for storage. Hearing the commotion, he became angry. He suddenly lifted the large number of copper coins with one hand, raising them above his head as if holding a pagoda. The Daoist priest was stunned and stared intently for a long time. He then slowly said, "Tomorrow at dawn, I will wait for you outside the city for a friendly match. Do not break your promise." He then carried his shovel and alms bowl and slowly walked away. An interested observer secretly followed him for more than ten miles outside the city to a remote place. He never stopped walking. The observer noticed that the iron shovel he carried weighed no less than ten pounds, and he never switched hands. It was clear that he had great strength in his arms, wrists, and fingers. The observer returned and told the manager of the money shop about this. They were both shocked and immediately ordered the apprentice to quickly return to his hometown to avoid trouble. The next day, the Daoist priest did arrive and demanded to see the apprentice. The crowd told him that the apprentice had left early and would not be returning. The Daoist priest angrily replied, "Coward! Coward!" and then left. The apprentice had no knowledge of martial arts. He simply used to pile coins on the board every day after finishing his work. At first, there were only a few thousand coins, which he would lift with his hands. Gradually, the number increased day by day, reaching dozens of pounds, which he could lift as easily as picking up a mustard seed. He never realized how strong he had become. Unexpectedly, his one lift had startled the Daoist priest and caused him to flee.</p>

<p>— Dai Xiaozhong</p>
<p>During a moment of leisure after work, I happened to read the recent Sunday supplement of the "Times" newspaper and found an article that the people of Shanghai should definitely read. Therefore, despite my limited knowledge, I have translated it as follows:</p>
<p>The famous Hollywood movie magnate Van Buren and his wife once visited Shanghai, causing a sensation. Upon their return to their country, as soon as they had settled down, Hollywood reporters became very active, seeking every possible detail about Van Buren's experiences in Shanghai, leaving no stone unturned. As a result, the city's newspapers devoted considerable space to the topic. However, upon examination, the content was mostly fabricated by reporters, without any basis, simply to create sensational stories. I will cite a few examples to illustrate the absurdity.</p>
<h3 id="e187">1+1=3 The Evolution of Nature <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>When lawyer Xu Guowei first moved into his lane residence, his friend Zhang Zhenlu sent him a silver shield as a congratulatory gift. The inscription read: "1+1=3." The inscription below stated: "To brother Guowei, from your brother Zhenlu, congratulating you with mathematical calculations." Using a mathematical equation as a congratulatory message can be considered a novel approach. The literary man is playful, and Zhang's planning of auspicious occasions and mastery of mathematics are also evident here. As for the inscription being in rhyme, it is no different from a chapter heading in a novel, showing that Zhang has not abandoned his storyteller's nature. Someone asked lawyer Xu, "Regarding the phrase 'based on law, obtaining a son,' I don't know which law or clause it is based on." Xu smiled and said, "According to Zhang, the common saying of 'Grandmother's Sutra' is the law of the women's quarters. Grandmother's Sutra says that one person becomes difficult, and two people become easy."</p>

<p>Patient: I actually feel much better.</p>
<p>Girl A: He said I sing very well. I'm the best among his girlfriends.</p>
<p>Girl B: He probably doesn't have many girlfriends.</p>
<p>Doctor (examining a patient): Your body is in very bad shape. You have at least six illnesses. If you want me to treat them, the medical fees will be very high, with no discounts.</p>
<p>Patient: Then would it be possible to wait until I have twelve illnesses before asking you to treat me, so you can give me a discount?</p>
<p>Woman: You're proposing to me now, and I must explain to you that my uncle is in legal trouble due to debt.</p>
<p>Man: It doesn't matter. Fortunately, my father has also been arrested and taken to court because his bank went bankrupt yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Record of Using Pigeons to Transport Drugs <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>Since the beginning, civilized countries have been exerting all their efforts to prohibit the transportation and trade of narcotics. However, the stricter the prohibition, the more ingenious the methods used by smugglers, inventing various ways to evade the law. As a result, the transportation of narcotics is becoming increasingly prevalent. I have often heard people say that as civilization advances, so do the number of cunning individuals, and the number of illegal activities also increases. Indeed, some smuggling methods involve using double-layered boxes, concealing narcotics within the layers to evade customs inspections. However, this method has been used for a long time, and the secret has become widely known, rendering it ineffective. Therefore, some people use horses, donkeys, and dogs, first feeding them narcotics wrapped in aluminum foil and then transporting them to their destination, where they are cut open to retrieve the narcotics. However, although this method is clever, the horses, donkeys, and dogs must sacrifice their lives after being used once. The procedure is cumbersome, and the profit is not high. Although such incidents have been discovered in the prosperous land of America, they are rarely seen in other countries. Chinese customs ports have other ingenious methods, and the use of animals is unheard of. Recently, I saw a shocking news item in a Western newspaper, revealing that white pigeons are being used to transport narcotics in America! Pigeons fly in the sky, high into the clouds, at great speed, making them difficult to shoot down, which is one advantage. Pigeons recognize their old homes and can return, saving manpower and eliminating the risk of getting lost, which is another advantage. Flying in the sky, they are not easily seen by state inspectors, which is a third advantage. Each transport does not harm the pigeons, and they can be used more and more efficiently, even countless times, until the pigeons die of old age, which is a fourth advantage. With these four advantages, the clever Americans have begun to imitate each other. Although the state's prohibition of narcotics is strict and the inspection is meticulous, there is nothing that can be done about it. So how is the transportation carried out? First, the pigeons are moved from their old home to a new location. Small aluminum cans are prepared, containing narcotics such as morphine, opium, and heroin. They are attached to the pigeons' legs and then released. The pigeons recognize their old homes and fly back. According to investigations, each pigeon carries narcotics worth from five to ten US dollars at the current market price. The amount carried each time depends on the distance of the journey and the pigeon's ability. This secret method has been used for a long time. It was first discovered by the government when a pigeon merchant in San Antonio reported it. The pigeon merchant had sold dozens of pairs of white homing pigeons to someone. Less than two months later, some of them flew back to the pigeon merchant's home. Upon inspection, it was found that small aluminum cans were attached to their legs, and upon closer examination, it was discovered that they contained cocaine (Note: a type of narcotic that is extremely expensive and prohibited from sale by the US government). The pigeon merchant was surprised and reported it to the police. The leak occurred because the buyer of the pigeons brought them back to raise and taught them to recognize their new nests for future use. After two months, the results were excellent, and they began using them to transport narcotics in the above-mentioned manner. Unexpectedly, some of the older pigeons did not adapt to the new nest and still remembered their old master, so they flew back. Now, the US government is discussing this issue and has begun investigating pigeon merchants everywhere, ordering them to record the addresses and names of pigeon buyers for detailed investigation. However, most of the people transporting narcotics now raise their own pigeons because pigeons are easy to raise and reproduce rapidly, and they grow up in one place, preventing them from getting lost along the way or being caught. Government officials can only lament their lack of ingenuity. Alas, the scheme is ingenious indeed! Therefore, I have written this down to warn against those who are cunning and evil.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Reading Ferrero's "Greatness and Decline of Rome" at night, I thought about how Greece excelled in the freedom of its city-states, but due to a lack of political unity, although it was able to resist Persia, it was eventually swallowed by the great Roman Empire. This is the drawback of being too small. The Yuan Dynasty was able to unify three continents—Asia, Europe, and Africa—but it could not last long. This is the drawback of being too large. Today, British and American colonialism have both the large and the small, which is why they are so powerful among the nations. In our Three Dynasties and the early Zhou Dynasty, the system of kings and officials dividing the people and assigning them duties also had both the large and small aspects. After the Han Dynasty, there was only the large without the small, resulting in an old and grieving nation. It is truly lamentable. Fortunately, Mr. Sun Yat-sen recently initiated nationalism, and we must also greatly advocate for self-governing groups, realize local autonomy, and begin to implement the rule of law. Then we will succeed. However, it is easy to act but difficult to know. Few people know, so ultimately the actions are ineffective. If we seek knowledge, then the spirit of the Zhou Dynasty's officials dividing the people and Mencius's system of regulating property, as well as the current laws of trade unions and the culture of self-governance and freedom of the Greeks, must be carefully studied. Thinking about this, I wanted to compile a comparison of Greek self-governance culture and Qilu culture, but I don't have the time. I will try to briefly describe its meaning.</p>
<p>The father of Western culture is Greece. Greece had dozens of small countries and two small city-states. The main states were Athens and Sparta. Sparta valued martial arts, similar to Qi. Athens valued literature, similar to Lu. As a result, Sparta defeated the Persian army of over 900,000, just as Qi dominated China and repelled foreign tribes. The literary Athens produced the three philosophers Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, just as Lu had Confucius and Mencius. Military achievements are suitable for a time, while culture is passed on to future generations. The representative of the culture and system of the Chinese Three Dynasties was Qilu. The parents of the culture and system passed on to today's Western countries are Athens and Sparta. The Zhou officials, Mencius, and the systems of the Zhou Dynasty are also the lifeline of our nation's politics, education, and self-governance. However, if one does not study Greece, there is no way to compare and bring out this spirit. Therefore, I want to compile a book comparing Greek self-governance culture and Qilu culture as a textbook for general self-governance courses, which is especially urgent for overseas Chinese. If there is someone who understands Greek civilization, I hope they will do it for me. I eagerly await it.</p>

<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>The Fauves (Continued)</p>
<p>Around 1906, the Fauvist movement arose from the inspiration of Matisse, Braque, Van Dongen, Vlaminck, Dufy, Friesz, and others. Fauvism was a reaction against the stagnation of the academic style and the reliance on rules of Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism. The ridiculed "Fauves," like the Cubists who followed, clearly saw that the scientific approach of Neo-Impressionism not only appeared technically limited but also exposed its poverty in artistic taste. This Neo-Impressionism, lacking excellence and depth, was clearly heading towards the fashionable decoration and the same boring neo-academicism as pure academicism. Therefore, the "Fauves" felt the need to open up a more profound ideal. They leaned towards something beyond the traditional impressions of nature. This view was based on the mixed objects of vision, that is, studying the objects from the already assembled and achieved objects. In other words, previous artists looked at the surface shapes of nature and depicted the so-called grandeur and beauty from them to create paintings. The "Fauves" were different. They wanted to capture an incredible emotion or mood in the depths of nature, or what they thought was in the depths of nature.</p>
<p>The "Fauves" opposed paintings that belittled individuality and depicted the surface shapes of nature. They believed that character and intention should not be bound by nature, but should use nature to stimulate personal inspiration. The purpose of painting was not to be a keen inventor of natural phenomena, but had other profound purposes. Because if it were only that, it would become a pitifully speculative little science, just as Renan criticized history. Therefore, the "Fauves" used their observational faculties to approach the goal of scientific analysis more closely. This observational faculty was inherited from Impressionism. They declared that in the "natural dictionary" introduced by Delacroix, they chose, needless to say, the kind of intention that was alive, and they chose the intention that came from a certain conceptual transformation of the enlarged form through the most delicate accumulation of color, to structure their works. From this point of view, they wanted to seek a new artistic achievement in the practical gains of their predecessors, which the predecessors had not discovered. Therefore, they were always concerned about striving to enrich this style so that their works would surpass those of the formally recognized masters.</p>
<p>In short, the "Fauve" painters wanted to find ways to implement the teachings of Cézanne, Seurat, and Renoir on the canvas. They advocated a "constructive" era, transforming the techniques of the Impressionists into an art, establishing its foundation on a new, particularly rich exploration of Neo-Classicism based on the tradition of Impressionism.</p>
<p>The first attempts of the "Fauves" were expressed by returning to tradition. This so-called tradition was not only in its literal sense but also in its spirit, because a work cannot exist solely on its appearance, but must also be immortalized by its soul. We can visit all the museums and discover the most abundant new research and technical principles. The works of the mixed-language era, such as the Cretan and ancient art of Greece and Byzantium, as well as the art of primitive people, Romans, and Mosatns, and even black art, can all be used to find the characteristics of that time. The "Fauves" tended towards a new spiritualization of the body, focusing on creating architectural structures, training and economizing all methods, and recognizing that this method could completely transform painting from its original sensuality into pleasurable. As for the path they took, it was through this constructive interest and the separation of lines, the transformation and reconstruction of the ideas of color masses, and finally, from the perspective of the values of form, depth, rigor, and economy, they advocated a strong and obvious "doing more with less," and opposed the rambling, redundant, and repetitive nature of Impressionism. Fauvism, with regard to nature, abandoned its external form and accepted its spirit. They did not take photographs but organized a landscape that was aroused by emotion. They did not imitate the external form of nature but were able to subtly stir the great harmony of the world.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Financial and Gold Market Experiences Sudden Ups and Downs <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Different Objectives for Insiders Entering and Exiting</p>
<p>The Confused State is Still Difficult to Break</p>
<p>The Unsettled Situation Leads to More Changes</p>
<p>Closing Price Drops by Two Taels and Nine Mace</p>
<p>The Issue of Taxing Spot Silver Remains Undecided. Yesterday (Monday), the Gold Exchange operated as usual, and the gold market trended downward. However, there were sudden ups and downs, and there was no certainty. The atmosphere sometimes contained positive and negative news. There was a deficit in foreign exchange, and speculators and industry insiders sold off. The forward gold price hovered around four taels. It was still difficult for those in the industry to break the confused state. Moreover, the buying and selling objectives were different. For example, Hengxing, Shengda, Yili, and Wanxing were all pursuing gains, while Yuanmaoyong, Fuchang, Yuancheng Yong, Dadesheng, Yu Zai, and others were selling. The early market saw large bars continuing to increase, but the price contracted instead, so it was still stable, with just over 500 taels. Later, sellers rushed in, immediately breaking the 500-tael mark. By noon, the price had fallen by more than four taels. The market changes became even more intense in the afternoon, with fluctuations of as much as six taels. Initially, due to the lingering effects of the weak noon closing, it was suspected that the issue of taxing spot silver, or its implementation, had caused a psychological vacuum among the various firms, who tended to sell, causing a sharp drop to within 492 taels. The foreign exchange also showed weakness, and the market almost fell off a cliff. Afterwards, it gradually looked up again, and the momentum turned to moderation. Then, suddenly, news came that the silver tax case was difficult to resolve due to various relationships. Buyers in the market suddenly became agile, and the price rose rapidly, continuing to rise by three or four taels, finally reaching between 97 taels. Fuchang, Yu Da, Hengxing, and others all started buying, but Yuanmaoyong, Yuansheng, Bingxing, and others were still selling. As for British silver bars, the telegrams the day before yesterday had increased by eight points of a penny, but the silver price had contracted by three-eighths of a penny. The morning opening was still outside the 500-tael mark. The April benchmark gold opened with an increase of four mace, at 500 taels and 004 mace, followed by five mace. In an instant, sellers were very active, and the price dropped by three taels, calculated as 97 taels, 67 mace. Then it added more than one tael. The exchange rate was flat. Forward British gold could be settled at 11 pence, 375. Japanese gold was only 1 tael, 04 fen, 0625. When the first telegraphic transfer was announced, it was suppressed by a small amount of money, at 98 taels, 6 mace. The listed price did not move, calculated as 98 taels, 23 mace. Later, because Zhengjin bought June Japanese gold at 1 tael, 03 fen, 9375, and Fuchang and others had a strong desire to sell, it fell to 97 taels, 12 mace. After 10 o'clock, Zhengjin bought forward Eastern exchange at 1 tael, 04 fen, 0625, and banks did interbank transactions on next month's Citibank at 47 yuan, 25, so it jumped up another two taels, reaching 99 taels, 23 mace around 11 o'clock. However, the situation suddenly turned weak afterwards, and the exchange rate followed with decline, and it was said that the implementation of the silver import tax had occurred, and people were terrified, so the price plummeted by two or three taels. The noon closing was 96 taels.</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM, the Lowest Point Reached 91 Taels and 6 Mace. The afternoon market opened at 494 taels and a half, then only 3 taels and 9 mace. Sellers were very active, and suddenly it went up by one tael, zero, to 95 taels. Banks absorbed June Japanese gold at 1 tael, 03 fen, 25. In an instant, sellers in the market surged, and the exchange rate was especially weak. June British gold was bought by Huabi for 11 pence, 625, and even 6875 was difficult to sell. The recent US dollar bank settlement price was as high as 47 yuan, 9375 to 875. People became more and more frightened and the price plummeted by more than three taels. At 2:30 PM, it suddenly dropped to 91 taels and 6 mace. Afterwards, it gradually turned upward, adding one or two taels. Finally, it was heard that the silver tax was unlikely to be implemented, so the atmosphere turned from bad to good, and Datong absorbed April US dollars at 47 yuan, 75, and the Bank of China entered June British gold at 11 pence, 625, which could be sold for 11 pence and a half. It continued to rise by three taels, totaling seven taels and four mace. At 4:20 PM, the closing price was 497 taels and 1 mace, down 2 taels and 9 mace compared to the 8th.</p>
<p>There Was a High-Low Range of Eight Taels and Nine Mace Throughout the Day. It was found that the highest price during the day was 500 taels and 005 mace, and the lowest price was 491 taels and 6 mace. In short, people were wavering and uncertain. The total difference throughout the day was 8 taels and 9 mace. The announced price was still 522 taels and 6 mace. The initial transaction was small, 24 or 5 taels, and the noon closing was more than 26 taels. The account registration for this month was 95 taels, and the next month was 96 taels. The water top-up was 95 taels, and the afternoon water top-up was 96 taels. The initial announced price was suppressed by 26 or 7 taels, and the lowest time was outside 30 taels. The closing price was still suppressed by more than 25 taels. The opening price of goods in the morning was 500 taels and 002 mace, the noon closing was 95 taels and 3 mace, the afternoon was 2 taels and 9 mace, and the closing price was 7 taels, it is said.</p>
<p>Dalian Banks Demand Exceeds Supply. The Yuanmaoyong, Fuchang, Dadesheng, Yuansheng, Taixing, Yuantai, Yu Da, and others have all sold. Yongcheng Chang, Wanxing, Shunli, Hengxing, Shengda, and others have all bought. Dalian banks' demand exceeds supply, buying more than 3,000 bars and selling 600 or 700 bars. In the afternoon, interbank transactions included Yuanmaoyong, Yuansheng, Yu Da, and others selling, while Wanxing, Shunli, Shengda, Hengxing, Yuancheng Yong, Fuchang, and others bought. Chengfeng Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Dadesheng, Yuantai, Yichang, Kunhe, Hengchang Yong, and others had inconsistent entries and exits. Dalian banks bought more than 1,000 bars and sold hundreds of bars. Shengda and Hengxing jointly bought about 1,400 or 1,500 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Foreign Exchange Experiences Initial Strength Followed By Weakness <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants All Threw Out</p>
<p>Yesterday, the large silver bars had no telegraphic transfers as usual, but the telegrams the day before yesterday (9th) continued to increase, but the silver price contracted instead. British and Japanese exchange rates rose slightly, Indian exchange rates had no market. Yokohama and Kobe had no gains or losses. As for the listed foreign exchange rates in this port, except for Hong Kong, which decreased by five mace, to 79 taels and 5 mace, the others did not fluctuate. The internal bank prices were initially strong and then weak, with good and bad times in the morning and afternoon. In the end, compared with last Saturday, the British pound increased by 1875, the US dollar increased by 4375, and the Japanese gold decreased by half a point. In fact, the benchmark gold had slight waves, resulting in fluctuations of nine taels. People were uneasy and uncertain, making it difficult to guess. Yesterday, the price broke into the 500-tael mark, and most Chinese merchants and speculators threw out their holdings. It is said that about 100,000 pounds were sold. Banks such as HSBC, Huabi, Mitsui, and Datong absorbed the sales, while Yufa Xiang slightly made agreements. Banks made interbank transactions of 10,000 to 20,000 pounds. More than ten thousand yuan of US dollars have also been sold, which were bought by Mitsui, Sumitomo, and Datong, while Hefeng slightly sold. More than one million yuan of Japanese gold was thrown out by the gold industry. Zhengjin, Taiwan, Sumitomo, and Mitsui all absorbed the sales. However, Guangbang Shengda bought tens of thousands of yuan, which was sold by Xingye. Most of them were hedging the benchmark gold.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Decline in Wheat Market <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening prices for the wheat market in the morning and afternoon presented a mixed picture. There were no transactions for the current month due to differing intentions between buyers and sellers. However, the April market suddenly plummeted. It is rumored that both buyers and sellers were prepared, with buyers reluctantly preparing to take delivery and sellers purchasing existing wheat from production areas along the Yangtze River to resist. As a result, market sentiment fluctuated, with prices declining gradually. However, if the drop becomes too severe, factories may potentially cause a shift in the future direction of the wheat market. Futures prices declined due to improved weather and waning investor interest, with April contracts falling by 6 points compared to the previous week, June by 2 points, July by 1 point, and August by 1 point. Spot wheat prices remained strong for factory purchases, with high-quality wheat commanding premiums of 1 to 2 points. Medium-quality wheat remained unchanged. 2,200 bags were opened, with Qingjiang wheat at 5 taels, 1 mace, and 7 fen to 2 qian, Huangqiao wheat at 5 taels, 1 mace, and 5 fen, and Zhenjiang wheat at 5 taels and 7 fen to 5 fen. These were reportedly purchased by factories such as Fufeng and Zhonghua.</p>
<p>Heavy Inventory of Tea in England</p>
<p>According to British dispatches, the British tea market has recently shown a declining trend. Inventory of black tea from India, Ceylon, and Java exceeds 300,000 chests. Since Russian buyers announced the cancellation of their previous large purchases of black tea, the market has become even more sluggish, with prices falling. While the highest quality Chinese Keemun and Ningzhou black tea are still selling well due to scarcity, mid-to-low grade tea has been greatly affected by Indian and Ceylon tea and is completely ignored.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Decline of Qifu Tea Firms <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Due to Heavy Losses Last Year</p>
<p>Production of Keemun and Fuliang red tea has increased daily, and exports have been smooth and frequent. In recent years, domestic red tea operators have been tending towards these two areas, resulting in increasing mountain prices and labor costs. Since the Association for Cooperative Advancement declared its closure last year, the red tea sales market has declined greatly, with many firms closing and incurring losses. This year, most of the original tea firms in Keemun and Fuliang are taking a wait-and-see approach due to last year's setback. According to surveys by tea industry insiders in the area, Keemun tea firms have been less affected and have sufficient capital, and are preparing to open the market. Fuliang tea firms have suffered greater losses, and it is still unclear whether they will reopen. Six Huizhou tea firms have decided to enter the mountains and have leased addresses in Keemun and Fuliang. As of recently, Keemun tea firms have decreased by approximately 30% compared to the past, and Fuliang by approximately 50%. In addition, due to the sluggishness of silver in Jingdezhen and inland areas, tea firms are adopting a cautious approach and reducing the amount of financing they provide, unlike the past when they competed to provide excessive financing.</p>
<p>Sharp Rise in Price of 18-Gauge Black Iron Sheet</p>
<p>Sales of 18-gauge black iron sheet are usually greatly reduced at this time of year, and there are no special circumstances to record in the market. However, due to high prices last year, few firms ordered it, resulting in very limited imports. Recently, however, demand in the market has surged, and existing inventory has been sold out. As a result, standard prices have been rising steadily. Buyers have been actively purchasing in the past two days, with prices rising sharply from 9 taels per dan to 9 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen. Demand from Tianjin and Qingdao is strong, and local enameling factories are also taking the opportunity to snap up existing inventory. The strong trading volume is the highest among all hardware products. It is expected that the market may face shortages in a day or two. In addition, 3-foot 6-inch iron sheet has also risen to 9 taels, but trading is not as active as 18-gauge.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News</p>
<p>Yesterday, various hardware goods totaling 11,500 to 11,600 dan arrived at the Gonghexiang Osaka Huangpu wharf warehouses.</p>
<p>It is reported that most of the goods are Japanese white iron, and there are also a considerable amount of French-made and Spanish-made nails, tacks, and sheet iron.</p>

<p>(6) Life in the Nest</p>
<p>The Shanghai swallow has a place to perch, simply called a "nest." Life inside the nest is worth studying. Some say it's a fairyland, others say it's like a living hell. Regardless of whether it's a fairyland or a hell, the facts tell us that the two are somewhat similar. To those who are used to seeing it, this kind of place is nothing new. Mentioning the word "nest" is as plain as mentioning the word "home." However, from another perspective, the business of this nest is ultimately secretive, and life in the nest inevitably carries a mysterious color. In short, the impression that the nest gives us is a kind of morbid state in the city.</p>
<p>The term "nest" is not very honorable. Thirty or forty years ago, their fathers and grandfathers used "rooms" and "halls" to represent their business. At that time, the momentum was clamorous, and so-called dignitaries made friends with them. When it came to the hands of the "nest" generation, it fell into decline, very different from the past. Not only could it not glorify the family, but it had to be pointed out and monitored everywhere.</p>
<p>You can't find nests along the street, just like birds don't build nests in tree roots. Going up to the nest inevitably involves climbing high, almost a fixed rule, and the road is bound to be unusually circuitous. High-end nests have relatively flat roads, while mid-to-low-end nests are really narrow paths. Seclusion arises from winding paths. For example, a nest in a lane usually enters and exits from the back door. A staircase, no more than a foot wide, leads from the ground to the second and third floors in a winding manner. When entering the door, everyone can't see their fingers. After walking four or five flights of stairs, there is light leaking from the wall. At the same time, there is a whirring sound and a smell that is neither foul nor fragrant sent to your ears and nose. Therefore, the first things you encounter when entering the nest are these three things: light, sound, and smell.</p>
<p>Even if everyone is unfamiliar and doesn't know each other, in the nest everyone "tacitly understands each other." Going up and down the stairs and entering and exiting the doorways, they don't necessarily use gestures to express themselves, but there is naturally a kind of "tacit understanding" in their psychology. Therefore, walking on the small ladder, everyone is calm and unhurried, moving with moderate speed. Especially those who come down from the upper floors, take every step firmly. Their eyes are not blurred, and their limbs are also strong. Seeing someone going up below, whether they know them or not, they often tell the person below "walk carefully." In the midst of humming and coughing, they reveal twelve points of sympathy. Once you get to the nest, it's best not to hesitate or look around. As for rushing forward and running up in one breath, that's even more inconsistent with the logic of the "nest."</p>
<p>What is the first impression of a glimpse into the nest? Generally, the first thing that enters the eyes of people who enter the nest for the first time is a swirling cloud of mist, in the middle of which are immersed many wax figures, as if they have just walked into a bathhouse. Looking to the left and right again, it is as if they are stepping on someone else's bed, with long legs and short feet in all directions, reaching their own bodies. In fact, these beds are called tatami mats. Those lying horizontally on the tatami mats all turn their bodies sideways and work hard on the lamplight, swallowing and spitting out, one puff on the left and two puffs on the right, the more they smoke, the more energetic they become. On a lamp the size of a soybean, all the troubles of the world are burned clean. Presumably the first puff is the most powerful, the mouth keeps sucking, and the shoulders also follow suit. Afterwards, it gradually slows down. The most unbearable is the situation where they want to stop but can't. A haggard face, thin lips, and a tightened mouth desperately sucking, the result is that there is only air and no sound. Poor people are thinner than yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The furnishings in the nest are simple and straightforward, saving as much as possible. Except for a clock hanging on the wall, which has the most complicated structure, there is nothing else worth mentioning. Therefore, the air in the room is clearly cold and lifeless. If it weren't for the gentlemen on the tatami mats desperately swallowing and spitting out, creating a rich and colorful atmosphere in the room, who would want to linger there? However, in this fairyland, where day and night are indistinguishable and sunlight never shines, "fairies" often descend, creating many karmic connections. They lie across the tatami mats, stretch their arms lightly, and produce pearls with a flick of the hand, enjoying everything in the same way. The only trouble is that they have to reapply their lipstick afterwards.</p>
<p>In the middle of the city that never sleeps, there is work that never sleeps. The "nest" is a source of excitement, and what is produced under the excitement is the various evils of the city. Gambling should be the first thing that has a related relationship because of the nest. Therefore, in the area around the nest, there are often many gambling places, and even the upper floor is a nest and the lower floor has gambling. It's not surprising that the parlor is shaking the dice and the small room is making a nest. What is strange is that what is written on paper becomes "news." Snack shops that are open all year round and fruit stalls that do business day and night all have a direct or indirect relationship with the nest. The only difference is that the pears, oranges, apples, and other fruits sold by the fruit stalls near the nest seem to have less juice and a drier appearance. Perhaps it is because the living standards in the city are getting higher and higher every day, and the friends in the nest are oppressed by life, which has a knock-on effect on the fruit stalls.</p>

<p>Beauty of Male Peacock Not Reflected in Female Eyes</p>
<p>Overturning Darwin's Theory</p>
<p>Yokohama dispatch: Mr. Grave, a German doctor practicing medicine in Yokohama, recently submitted a German academic dissertation entitled "A Study on the Color Biology of Pupillary Response to Short Wavelength Light" to the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Tokyo, Japan. After being approved by them, it will be recognized by the Japanese Ministry of Education and awarded the title of Doctor. The content of his research is the theory of the Darwinian school, which has always recognized the beauty of the feathers and body colors of lower animals such as black carp, identified the species' own gender, and cited it as a condition for natural selection. This theory is explained from a purely subjective standpoint. In response to this theory, Dr. Hess, Professor of the University of Munich in Germany and Mr. Grave's teacher, first studied the color recognition ability of chickens from an objective standpoint based on experiments, saying that chickens also have color vision for long-wavelength light such as red and yellow, the same as humans, but they are dull in distinguishing blue and other short-wavelength colors, or it is difficult to distinguish each color as grayscale with brightness. Mr. Grave further used experimental methods to photograph the changes in the pupil size of chickens and other lower animals when they saw various colors, and compared their sizes. For the situation described by Dr. Hess that the beauty of the male peacock is not felt by women, he further proved it with scientific experiments, saying that the beauty of the male peacock is not caused by the special beauty for the purpose of attracting females, but is the inevitable result of the physiological internal secretion and metabolism.</p>

<p>Chapter 38: Nineteenth-Century French Prose</p>
<p>As that shoulder gradually grew, that head became many heads with all sorts of power. In the early years of the same century—plus or minus a few years—novelists such as Balzac, Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, and George Sand, and the critic and essayist Sainte-Beuve, were born. Balzac, the most prolific and powerful of French novelists, though he did not understand or announce his purpose until he had written many works, attempted to depict all aspects of life and called his complete works of novels 'The Human Comedy.' He did not live to complete his plan; he died at the age of fifty. 'The Human Comedy' transcends the scope of any one person, one country, or one era. However, no novelist before or after Balzac has had more right to such a universal title. He created a multitude of people who readers of any country—most of his books have been translated into all European languages—recognize as themselves and their friends and enemies, regardless of local or worldly circumstances. Balzac studied all types of Parisians, farmers, and the petty bourgeois society of small towns. Because most of his life was spent at his desk, and he was involved in the toil of undertakings that would exhaust the energy of ordinary people, it is inconceivable how he found the time to directly know so many kinds of society. The answer is that he had an unparalleled innate talent as a novelist: insight. To understand, absorb scenes and characters, make them part of himself, and give accurate details—sometimes too many details—it only took one look. His insight was strengthened by his great intellectual honesty and courage. In this respect, he resembled Scott, whom he greatly admired. Like Scott, he had to write too much to maintain a troubled life. However, he never evaded the responsibility of a writer, often working superhumanly for sixteen hours in a row, revising and polishing his works, and imbuing most of them, even extremely lengthy pages, with the inexhaustible power of immortal life. Balzac's works could practically resolve the long-standing theoretical dispute between romance and realism, which is still being conducted somewhat meaninglessly, before it even arose. For critics and novelists who investigate theories about their art, that is an interesting specialized question. Doesn't the fact that any long fictional work, regardless of its content or source material, is called a 'Roman' in the precise language of the French themselves answer that question for them? Moreover, doesn't the place practiced by the greatest French novelist, who viewed all or most of life as a romantic adventure of souls and events and spared no pain to give a true impression of facts, also answer that question? In Balzac, literal interpretation and imaginative fantasy do not conflict. Readers may see conflicts, but Balzac did not feel them. His greatness lies in the scope of his sympathy. In 'Eugenie Grandet,' he depicts a simple country girl in a narrow environment. In other books, he writes of the 'splendors and miseries' of other types of women. He was the first to incorporate the base romance of business and money into novels. In 'César Birotteau,' he used his own experiences in the world of commerce. In many, almost all, of his novels, such as 'Cousin Pons,' 'Cousin Bette,' and 'Old Goriot,' various forms of greed, miserliness, selfishness, and other hateful motives flow. Balzac is not a person who loves life in an affectionate, sentimental way. His view of life is proper and often harsh, but when it comes to young girls, it is often gentle. His attitude towards youth is generally stern. He had described 'egoists' several times long before Meredith wrote about them. He pushed the emotional life far beyond the sounds of happy couples' weddings. Marriage is just an interlude. People live on, into old age—Balzac's depictions of delusional, unpleasant, and pathetic old people are strikingly skillful. This observer of men and women has a sense of scene and circumstance, and although he is usually not a poet in style, he can approach the realm of prose poetry in 'Séraphîta,' which can be regarded as a Swedenborgian experiment in mysticism. This aspect is also thought-provoking. He is indeed a Colossus or Colosseum (Note 1), because later novelists have quarried stone from his great structure to build smaller-scale buildings.</p>
