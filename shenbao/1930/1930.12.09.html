<p>對留日學務糾紛問題</p>
<p>留日學務發生糾紛早誌各報兹悉駐日留學生監督王克仁氏業於前日乘日輪長崎丸抵滬新聲社記者當即走訪王氏於大中華飯店據王氏談留日學務至爲難辦無論何省學生遇經濟困難時即到監督處借貸均以爲監督處爲政府機關豈有甘聴本國學生困難異國不加援手之理甚至各省經理員於本省官費未能區到之際亦常到監督處設法其意亦謂監督處爲管理全國留學生機關今某省學生困難監督處斷不易卸責不問也有此種之情形應付非常困難此次發生糾紛實基於此兹略别爲三個問題</p>
<p>第一日華學會借欵問題查日華學會本爲一種私人團體專門辦理日華關係敎育事件本年六月間湘贛官費不能按期匯到於是贛省經理員鄧天民往日華學會交涉借欵五千元由贛經理員分借三千元湘經理員分借一千二百元皆自立借據自往取欵本人不過在借據上簽字保證除此四千二百元外監督處亦往借八百元原意是應桂鄂官費學生之急後以接敎部電令允撥欵作湘桂各省官費學生歸國旅費遂以桂生需欵可在此欵中活用鄂省已得本省官費本可不再借欵不料廣東經理員羅翼羣亦來借欵遂不得不向日華學會仍借該欵以應羅氏之急就中經過有湘贛經理員親筆信件可證且進行借欵時鄧天明曾在學務會議中報告有學務會議錄可查並非詭鄙行爲本人自問並無錯誤更無弊端不明此種經過者竟以爲監督處受日本文化事業部之補助竟以爲文化事業部以五千元託日華學會轉監督處救濟留學生本人對此曾正式致函文化事業部質詢經該部部長坪上貞二正式答覆並無此事均有文件可憑至日華學會借岀之欵暗中是否由文化事業部而來抑或與文化事業部有若何關係當湘贛兩省經理員以及監督處前往借欵時毫無所知直至最近發生糾紛本人質詢日本文化事業部部長乃有當初日華學會借岀之欵係從地方移借而來深恐未能按期歸還致日華學會窮於應付因而指定五千元以爲日華學會擔保之言然此種情形當初文化事業部及日華學會皆未對湘贛兩省經理員及監督處道及雙字本人於得悉之後曾質詢坪上部長當初何不爲監督一言而坪上堅持爲文化事業部與日華學會間事無通告監督處之必要本人對此曾深致不滿好在湖南經理員向該會所借之一千二百元及監督處借來轉借廣東經理員之八百元皆已償清僅鄧天民一案尙未償還然不久亦當由該員如數還清此爲正式借貸固不能認爲接受日人補助也</p>
<p>第二中央撥欵救濟學生問題今年四五月間金價高漲國内政局不寗湘桂等省學生無論官費自費俱感困難本人據情陳明公使轉行政院請撥發鉅欵以便資遣回國並直接電陳敎部同様請求後據公使接行政院覆電謂已議决飭財部照撥但財部始終未撥分文至議决資遣回國學生亦未確定限於官費或自費僅敎部覆電謂可撥崇欵國幣萬元作湘桂諸生官費生回國旅費以與行政院議决原案稍有不同監督處接此電後認爲官自費學生待遇不平易滋糾紛故就近呈准公使暫不發表滿擬親自回國向敎部詳陳困難查接電時在六月二十八本人七月三日即返國於七月十日見蔣部長詳陳官自費生必須同様救濟理由蔣部長當已面許後又晤高等敎育司孫司長彼初爲部令限於官費係根據監督處電呈後將原電翻閲又知原電對於官自費生俱已提到因對本人面呈並無異議本人以爲蔣部長及孫司長皆敎部負責人員旣經面允當可照辦返日後對留學生經濟困難者無論官費自費歸國與否均在敎部允撥欵項中分别酌借以資救濟此種處置一面係職責所在不能坐視實亦因已得蔣部長及高司長之面允也不料近接敎部指令對於此項借支學生各欵竟有未允核銷者殊岀意外查借與學生各欵如有不實本人自當受嚴厲之處分如無不實則旣經部司長面許而不予核銷其中似有誤會本人自當再行呈明</p>
<p>第三序補庚欵學生問題就敎部指令不明眞相者以爲監督序補庚欵不合者乃多至十餘人實則敎部所指爲不合之十八人中四名係敎部認爲專門學校畢業生再進大學不應續領庚欵然而歷年之以專門學校卒業人大學繼續給費者實不乏人一名列爲前任錯呈早已由本人呈明改正部中未查原案誤指不合現已查明准予給費矣又一名則爲上年已在大學給費學生敎部查岀當年核准原案係在專攻科研究今仍在大學給費亦指爲本人錯誤實則監督處固不料一年前之舊案中有此一椿公案也此外尙有十二人係　繼續研究或實習者六月底接部奉令命其再繳成績候核雖七月中旬敎部有令停補庚欵但未便將前令餘　成績候核者亦包刮在内至序補韓靜媛及戴良謨庚欵亦有多少曲折本人總有手續欠缺周到之處然實際並無絲毫弊端亦敢亦信者王氏談畢並將寄敎部公使館呈及政黨部各方面原函以及日本文化事業部部長坪上貞二湘贛兩省經理員等信件一一岀示可見留日學務之難辦實非筆墨可以形容後之爲監督者亦難矣（新聲社）</p>

<p>雙方所繋爭之點</p>
<p>爲契約有效與否</p>
<p>法官諭定期宣判</p>
<p>仍希望兩造和解</p>
<p>貽尊公司主葉山濤夏間命其經租人英商通和洋行通知山西路集益里之房客岀屋遷讓以便翻造房客組織聯合會與業主交涉議定加租及延長租賃年期之條件詎業主旋復悔約並將該項房產以代價一百十萬售與合興公司爲業致房客迭經新舊房東之催告逐客之令頻仍等契約於廢紙該房客等乃聯絡十七户同延陳霆鋭律師向特區地方法院提起訴訟請求判令貽尊公司葉山濤確認</p>
<p>所訂租約爲有效並着合興公司應受該項契約之拘束貽尊亦延陸仲良律師除辯訴否認契約已經成立外並提反訴追償該房客等所積欠租金八千餘兩而合興公司則延蔡·李·兩律師亦</p>
<p>對房客提起反訴要求判令遷移業由許文鎔推事一度開庭集訊曾記前報昨晨傳有人證繼續審理首由房客新民旅館訴述該項租賃合同係由通和洋行置備並按份塡寫房客之門牌姓名分送各房客簽字蓋章乃通和嗣則不來取去新民處集益里弄内</p>
<p>照所議加租等級弄内之屋加三成而被告對於新民初欲照市房之五成加租辦法幾經磋商彼堅持須加三成半故新民未即於租約上蓋章並非對全部條件不贊同也次傳盧少棠訊問與房東談判之經過據盧稱我係由房聯會派代表來</p>
<p>挽我與房東磋商遂赴通和洋行徵取業主意見據云房東主張市房加五成里内加三成將來如五年期内發生坍屋情事房東不負責任且須房客在此五年期内不許頂替房客如俱認可則緩期五年拆造嗣房客中有三數家</p>
<p>對條件不盡同意而通和則須全體一致否則不簽租約我因衆意不一遂告辭調停由張星齋繼續與房東交涉云云而房客墨華軒主即聲明挽盧與房東交涉係由收租人應先生所指示因應謂盧與葉山濤最爲接近嗣盧之告退則由於通和九月十九日致房聯會聲明撤銷所定租約所致蓋其覺此已成之議而忽取消無以對房客遂告退也繼由張星齋陳述彼繼盧後與房東談判情形謂房客嗣見</p>
<p>房東不允展五年取消前議之信後曾减至一年而此一年内不拆造不加租不料斯時發生里内之屋兩次倒坍之事房東益不允爲須臾之緩矣當有數房客聞張述坍屋事即加以聲明謂所坍者乃房客自蓋之披屋且祇損一橡片堵而非棟折榱崩隨即開始辯論先由原告律師陳霆鋭發言歷時最久大致謂第一被告貽尊公司之反訴欠租殊無理由緣各原告非不抗租且願</p>
<p>照新加租額照付因彼自不來收現猶存儲銀行以待是其反訴當不成立而第二被告合興公司之反訴遷移應屬初級審理况其反訴之目的與本訴不同自無抗辯之必要至原告請求確認契約爲有效及着第二被告須受此契約拘束之理由則甚充分蓋此契約已成立且有三數家已照新加租額付租是已發生效力即通和九月十九之信亦承認有此契約而要求撤銷口血未乾言猶在耳何能反悔其要求撤銷之原因復多與原告不涉至謂彼方未簽字可以推翻雖似近理然一考此約之性質則無取消之餘地緣契約旣由通和備妥實無殊通和</p>
<p>對於房客之要約依法被要約人無拒絶要約之表示則要約方面應受拘束本案原告不但未嘗拒絶且即遵命蓋章接受被告烏得不受拘束爲特請求判决確認租約爲有效並責令第二被告同受拘束云云次由貽尊之律師答辯謂繫爭之契約被告旣未簽字且尙在原告手顯未成立自可撤銷至謂要約一層則原告對被告有五年不加租五年不拆造之要約而通和所提岀者爲不頂替乃各房客對此意見不一不啻表示拒絶而被告亦可取消前議且已</p>
<p>兩次發生坍屋事足見屋已陳舊總之原告旣不能提岀雙方簽字之契約應請駁斥其訴被告反訴欠租今審各原告提岀之存欵摺旣未齊全且内有數扣未書户名及所存之欵不足所欠者可見各原告欲藉訟案拖欠租金欠之旣鉅倘潛自遷移被告必大受損失請求即予判决並宣示假執行云云末由合興公司之律師辯稱合興之反訴與本訴有因果關係</p>
<p>原告之審級主張殊屬錯誤請予駁斥茲合興因體諒遷移者起見特再展寛一月至明年二月底止於法律人情盡之已極矣許推事乃諭辯論終結定期十六日宣判並勸雙方在此期内岀外和解</p>

<p>— 妍盲</p>
<p>在美國第一成功劇　美報對此劇評論之一斑</p>
<p>梅蘭芳前次游美聲譽極盛已著簡册而藝術上成功之最大力量厥惟剌虎一劇此劇係述明代亡國時李自成迫近京師公主逃亡猶恐爲賊追索有費宮人貞娥佯飾公主匿於枯井中後爲李賊部下搜得獻於自成自成以之妻將軍李過李饒勇善戰所往無敵人皆譽之曰一隻虎在成婚之夕貞娥乘其酒醉而殺之貞娥初意本在剌殺自成至是雖誤中副車猶自悔大才小用奮慨之餘亦自剄而死全劇名鐵冠圖剌虎爲其中最精采之一節也梅氏在美每演此劇輒傾動城市觀者如堵續演一月之久而抱向隅之嘆者猶不知凡幾其價値可知矣此劇結搆固佳義意亦極深刻再加以梅氏之表演細膩動人絲毫不苟盛譽之來良有自也昨日友人惠以所集梅氏在美各報評論一册茲將關於剌虎數節簡譯如下</p>
<p>紐約晚報稱梅氏所演剌虎云「剌虎是給人有深刻意味的戲劇因爲是復仇與犠牲」</p>
<p>紐約早報云「剌虎是説一個宮女復仇的事像這齣戲的意思近代的Juditb　of　Betbulia同The　Road　to　Rome兩劇裏面意頗模仿近之」</p>
<p>紐約電報云「剌虎這齣戲比其他的幾齣戲更使我們容易明白我們對於這齣戲更感覺得無窮興味梅君所飾之宮女狠像沙翁劇裏的Lady　Macbeth麥克白司」</p>
<p>美國劇壇評論家楊史德云「中國戲處處像眞而同時離眞處處是日常生活的表現而表現岀來的並不是日常生活很使我們的驚奇中國的戲是一種極高深的程式將整個的藝術表現岀來」</p>
<p>又云「對於中國戲最使我得到非常深刻的印象的就是剌虎這齣戲」</p>
<p>紐約日報云「梅君是「舞」「做」「歌」三種集合而成的一個人從來没有看見過手勢表演得如此之美的於舞台上」</p>
<p>紐約太晤士報上云「梅君表演極純凈如森林裏面的一池清水」</p>
<p>又説「梅君的姿勢莊嚴之中而含美麗不可以言語形容之」</p>
<p>楊史德云「梅君的動作表情無論休止的Repose驚動的Shock是最完美純凈化藝術的精華恐懼Fear憐惜Pity謀殺决心Murderous　Reoolution失望Despair種種的狀態都能現示在他的面部全身無處不是藝術的流露而没有片時離開了美」</p>
<p>以上所舉觀之梅君前次在美所得之美滿批評可見一斑矣</p>

<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>巡禮意大利日記</p>
<p>（三）羅馬十日（十一）</p>
<p>第三日—德拉亞圓柱—聖彼得梵訶里敎堂—</p>
<p>旅行意大利而涉足羅馬市街的人不論是誰總是感到其間充滿着羅馬時代和文藝復興的遺構之不同的滋味看了許多浴塲凱旋門紀念碑或伽藍和宮殿的大建築更升堂入室而觀摩其中的雕刻和繪畫尤其可以認岀它那主要使命和藝術的因素之不同點羅馬時代忙於發展國力其特質爲軍國的策略的專重實利實益所以那時的藝術品只有「必然」與「實用」缺少了純粹的藝術創作慾因此就成了眞的實現主義這所以當時的建築和雕刻大都是會堂大浴塲圓劇塲凱旋門紀念柱橋樑水道至今遺跡遍於羅馬各處自十四世紀爲始之文藝復興雖曰追蹤古典藝術但是它那精神所在仍舊是千年以來隨基督敎文化而演化的在建築方面從地下塋窖而巴西里加式Basilica而羅馬式Romanesque而峨特式Gothic而比讓庭Byzantium一直發揮到文藝復興式文藝復興式的建築自意大利而遍於歐士當時他們并把古時代的遺物破壞了取了那些石材成雕刻來装飾墳墓敎堂—例如羅馬聖彼得大敎堂的大理石柱即有自海特倫Hadrianus墳墓者聖約翰拉得來敎堂的銅門即移自加拉浴塲—羅馬的大建築世界第一大伽藍的聖彼得敎堂也是在這個時期完成的</p>
<p>從德拉亞圓柱廣塲徐徐繞道而過鬥獸塲忽然走上幾十級石階的一個高原聖彼得梵訶里San　Pietroin　Vincoli寺雄偉的奇構就聳在廣塲的前面這是四世紀所建築的巴西里加式的主要的遺構是與文藝復興的建築的式様不同的自從君士坦丁帝把基督敎定爲國敎以後基督敎徒就從地下塋窖Catacombs走岀在地上建築巴西里加敎堂後來巴西里加的建築直接傳統於羅馬式建築另一方面又因君士坦丁大帝之東遷而移到比讓庭去而演進爲比讓庭藝術</p>
<p>聖彼得梵訶里寺是一所長方形的建築内部有華麗的磨石綺克Mosaico一千五百六年的那時候敎皇徐洛第二Julius　II委託米克朗琪羅Michelangelo在此建造他的陵墓本來米氏預定要作摩西那様的巨像凡數十座之多應用西施庭Sixtine天頂那般威力莊嚴所具有的壯美的理想之具象不幸開始工作不久就以建築家勃拉曼特Bramante的讒嫉竟就中止了他那驚人的大計劃這是羅曼羅蘭所悽惶歎息而引爲人類無窮的大損失的</p>
<p>摩西Moies巨像現在祭壇之右面我們一看去就覺得那雕像憤怒到了不可遏抑臉上筋肉隆起表白崇嚴偉大的精神簡直具有阿爾卑斯山嶺的偉力呢</p>

<h3 id="c203">近東回敎國底婦女運動 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 易康</p>
<p>近東回敎國内的婦女們在早日也和舊時代的中國婦女們一様的關閉在深閨裏但是自從土耳其埃及波斯和阿富汗等國相繼的民族革命成功後婦女們也伴着革命而被解放了在她們自覺中婦女運動已經在近東的各國内起來了</p>
<p>所以現在她們從家庭裏岀來走向公立學校公立法庭跳舞廳甚至於進入到商業的世界這已經成了從土耳其到亞拉伯從埃及到阿富汗的普通現象西方的女子來與她們作國際友誼的結合她們到歐洲去參與國際婦女會議我們從近東各國内婦女界的現象觀察在土耳其顯着歐洲的趨勢在埃及顯着一種穏健的進展在叙利有一種决定論在婦女中爭論着在波斯亞拉伯和阿富汗中呈顯着舊禮敎與新思想的衝突然而無論在何處一種覺悟的狂潮已經伴著近東各國的革命運動而興起了</p>
<p>最近在叙利亞底逹瑪斯卡斯舉行的近東婦女會議是近東各國空前的盛舉從近東各國派來了代表講演使用着在亞洲語言以外的文字歐洲國際婦女聯合會底代表使用着法語波斯代表使用着英語土耳其代表使用着流利的亞拉伯語這次會議議决了很多的議案而最重要的三個目的是實行一夫一妻制廢除蓄女女子有選擇丈夫底權利遁世主義底廢絶</p>
<p>回敎女子底面紗在土耳其已先完全取消了她們已不復戴著面紗長長的困守在男子們爲她們造就的黑欄Haerem中了這種廢除女子面紗的運動自從一九一二年在康士坦丁堡有一個女子廢除面紗在街上行走而且向婦女們講演以後婦女在伴着土耳其民族革命而起的婦女運動已經做到了婦女面紗的全部廢絶而在婦女運動中實地的在政治上給於婦女們以自由的土耳其國民黨的領袖凱末爾是有着不少的力量所以近代土耳其底婦女是竭力地去接受歐洲的經騐她們不僅僅是要去到學校求得知識而且要去作工來獲得經濟的獨立她們要尋覓自已心願底丈夫她們要獨立起來籌劃她們一切底計劃她們去到咖啡店和跳舞塲去實行社交公開她們讀着綠蒂羅素蕭伯納等的著作她們在雜誌或報紙的賽美評判者之前穿着歐化的装束她們獻身去作戲劇及其他的藝術運動她們破壞了土爾其舊有的典型幾乎完全仿效着美國僑寓的姑娘們土耳其姑娘們在回敎徒姊妹中算是最幸福的自由而獨立的人了</p>
<p>埃及的回敎女子的前途是没有土耳其那様的順利而她們底解放道路上時常發現荊棘正宗派的回敎徒認爲在「可蘭經」上没有明明的記載着女子應戴帽子所以在民族運動首領圭斯阿明（Zasimin　Amin）「婦女解放」（The　Emanciation　of　Woman）一岀版後立刻便引起了十幾本書來反抗他但是圭斯阿明已經握住了許多人底心甚至在開難城底亞薩耳大學也有他底學生他主張改良婚姻改良離婚與多妻的法律主張女子平等主張女子廢除面紗在當時引起了很大的反對但是以後就連在女子中那爲何沁巴洗(Rushdi　Pasha)第一個妻子的女也著了兩本書來和着圭新阿明底主張了</p>
<p>經過了許多婦女運動先驅者的努力在今日埃及開羅城内的幾種著名的雜誌都有婦女們在充任編緝最著名的女作家便要算惹德（Nary　Ziade）了她是從叙利亞利巴嫩山來的一位基督敎姑娘她在開羅底家是全城各種宗敎的男女智識份子的磁她使用筆名Ｍary來發表她底關於婦女問題和文學作品的文字不久間她便成了婦女運動中的一個有力的權威不僅是在埃及而她底作品已經成了亞拉伯文國家内讀者底唯一讀物</p>
<p>在叙利亞回敎的婦女們也參加到社會事務和文學與藝術的紀念但是關於廢絶面紗的事使没有土耳其婦女那様勇敢雖然她們反對舊的傳統但是終久没有獲得她們所期望的自由所以她們連揭下面紗的勇氣都没有時要如土耳其的姑娘那様的獲得經濟的地位便更難了只有在衣服上叙利亞婦女已經採取了巴黎Boulevord底様式在街上行走時常常引起人們的注意不過近來一批好慕歐洲時装的婦女們也企圖打倒一切的舊禮敎在那禮敎壁壘的逹瑪卡斯已經有人樹起反抗的旗幟更是最近在逹瑪卡斯舉行的婦女會議在議案上已行步伍着土耳其婦女們的一切壯舉將來一定是可以獲得光明的</p>
<p>所以今日在叙利亞和巴力斯坦與伊拉苦（Iraq）的婦女們都已從事各種事業的努力無論是基督敎徒回敎徒或者利巴嫩山底朱色（Iruse敎徒們都在一處工作着來培植他們底經濟地位雖然在宗敎信仰上不同但是她們都同意於經濟與政治之組織與獲得對於敎育她們都公認爲是走向成功的唯一好工具因此在耶路撒冷逹瑪卡斯柏依洛提（Beriut）巴格逹德（Begdad）四個大城中所興起的敎育運動是比巴黎時装運動强烈得多在二十年以前在柏依洛提城只有二十個回敎姑娘從事讀者但是據今日敎育委員所發表的統計單是這一城已經超過一千人以上了</p>
<p>柏依洛提城是近來敎育底領導中心有許多本地的外國的學校與學院和大學而且式式是勝過於世界上一切城市所有的花様但是在歐戰前的女子學校完全是由外國敎會所設立的回敎徒的父母們反對把他們底女兒送到異敎徒的敎會學校内讀書在歐戰後一切外國敎會的學校關閉了叙利亞婦人瑪麗加撒布（Marv　Kassab）在英國人底敎會内開了一所本地學校在數年開學生由二十人而逹到三百人使鄰國發生了對於女子敎育的熱忱直到今日巴力斯坦依拉苦逹瑪卡斯以及一切亞拉伯語國家内的往事於各種事業的回敎徒們基督敎徒和巴嫩山的朱色敎徒的婦女們都到瑪麗加撒布底安里亞學校（Ahlyah　School）來讀書了她並没有甚麽成功的秘密雖然智識與熱心爲别人嘉詡但是由叙利亞人主持却是秘密的第一要點</p>

<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>星期日的夜裏和志任從一家小影戲院裏走岀因爲片中悲劇的故事所引岀的眼涙還滋濕在眼匡内而内心也湧潮着無限憂鬱於是都感覺到想弄點酒喝喝</p>
<p>我的意思是想找一家小西洋Bar去但志任却想吃點中國菜這様在走盡了一條冷靜的街頭後我們便進了一家舊式的中國餐館這是同歐洲的Cafe一様在裏面有各式各様的人囂聚着所以各種的新聞我們都能在裏面聽得像這様的地方他都有相當歷史一切装飾與餐具都仍是舊世紀的風味正因此牠也才得有那些顧客那些顧客也都是和牠有歷史的</p>
<p>我和志任在這様塵囂中噪雜的談論聲爭執聲賽拳的咆哮聲茶役的呼應聲箸聲酒杯的掽撀聲……與酒氣肉耆及各種的菜味的混合氣味……尋找到半張餐桌據坐着</p>
<p>於是我們慢慢地啜飲杯中的白玫瑰</p>
<p>「啊我是自從南歸來到今天差不多二個多月了只一次夜裏在一個親戚的寓所裏和幾個老先生們喝了兩玻璃杯陳酒這次覺第二次喝酒奇怪我一個人决没有興致喝酒志任這你該可以想到我生活的孤寂了」</p>
<p>「然而我的孤寂簡直要把我弄成像一個空寂的大廳堂裏的鐘一様呢」</p>
<p>「但你還有一羣羣的小學生和你談天呢由這些小小者的靈魂中你將不會再孤寂」</p>
<p>「啊你何嘗體騐到那種生活的機械式之可怕」</p>
<p>「唉我正想有如此規律的生活否則我的神經衰弱症是再没有法子醫治了這病使我痛苦」</p>
<p>於是我舉起杯來我明知杯裏的流汁對於我的病將更有壞的影響然我没有權力阻止牠不傾入肚裏去</p>
<p>這様因爲嘴裏被東西塞住得持續了一會沉默</p>
<p>「生活的苦痛屢屢令我回憶起過去的歡樂而趨於悲觀」志任説</p>
<p>「這是青年最大的危機志任我生活的痛苦更甚於你關於往事的回憶也是難免的不過我自信我没有悲觀一切我仍然是追求着你看自我離了學校以後我的熱情仍就保持着」</p>
<p>「這我非常相信你」</p>
<p>「如摰居在四川的止厂他屢次來信都是往事不堪回首的句子我的回信都是呌他重加上熱力但是没有法子生活的重担是給青年以最大的戕煞像我們没有老婆兒女的人總還算是幸福的呢」</p>
<p>志任只一聲唉嘆</p>
<p>「有時候想起些往事確也是有趣的事呢志任你記得不我們最初認識是在南京」</p>
<p>「是呢當年南京的友人如今一個消息也没有了」</p>
<p>「那時你起先和鄒小瀛他們同住在花牌樓裱晝舗裏後來搬到漢西門」</p>
<p>「唉不知道到那裏去了」</p>
<p>「他完全是個小孩子」</p>
<p>「我們從漢西門又搬到體育塲」</p>
<p>「總之那一年是糊裏糊塗過去了」</p>
<p>「我們説算有緣的後來又同來了上海」</p>
<p>「到上海因此又遇到止厂他們呢」</p>
<p>「呵那年冬天止厂對開追求得很熱烈」</p>
<p>「像止厂總是很幸運的人一般朋友們都這様説「只有止厂對Ｋ是維持得很平安地」不過因爲時間的不長止厂是老於逢迎女人的但愛情像這様平平淡淡地度過去的確也可以省得日後的追悔」</p>
<p>「所以呢止厂回四川了像你這様瘋瘋癲癲的人怎様去談愛情」</p>
<p>「愛情的失敗與成功並没有什麽但我却因此結了多少仇敵起初是老黎末了還有老關我非常否認他們這態度」</p>
<p>「止厂雖然和開好始好終然而你和開的感情確是有過一度熱烈的過程恐怕止厂决不能和你比擬」</p>
<p>「正因此愛情逹到最高潮便早遲要形成破裂的可能其實一切事物都是如此」</p>
<p>「據一般談説那都是由於你的太使女人對愛情失望呢雖然去年後半年我離開了上海没有看到你們的結局」</p>
<p>「我全然承認我的不是我曾發誓過如果可能的話我要對她懺悔啊」</p>
<p>「是呢如今你生活與態度的由動而變爲靜由不住的跳躍而變爲沈默那多少由於她的影響」</p>
<p>「固然但這次北游也經了我不少剌激不過外表是靜了然内心也許更動些你相信不」</p>
<p>「是你的北行也由於她的影響呢」</p>
<p>「在北地生活的没有秩序使我感受了極度的痛苦所以我急急地南歸了」</p>
<p>「啊想起來如果你不在新世界門口遇到老徐恐怕到今天也不會知道我也在上海而我一様也不會知道你會從北方回來當我離開上海回到家鄉去了半年半年中給於我極大的敎訓以前我總自信若在外面没法生活時總可以回家誰知如今知道現實正於此想法相反回家是再不會有我吃飯的位置了所以我只有來上海就這機械的事幸虧老范他給我留着」</p>
<p>「想起老范也不幸官塲的夢在他又實現過了」</p>
<p>「他來信説損失了三千多元呢僅僅做了一兩個月的官不久就要來上海了」</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>「啊這些往事這些往事……」</p>
<p>於是我啜下最後一滴酒志任笑着説</p>

<p>「如果我們幻想一下未來的話在一年後十年後我們又是什麽様子呢」</p>
<p>「不是兒女滿堂就是光棍一做總之我一定是光棍一個」</p>

<p>— 矢勇</p>
<p>一向是被沉悶的空氣充塞的同濟這學期來學術的組織是異常的活躍往昔平凡而沉鬱的學校生活頓呈生氣蓬勃的氣勢最近更有新生社的產生這實是沉悶空氣中的警鐘學生組織的新現象</p>
<p>「新生社」原名「青社」這是在未開正式成立大會以前暫襲的名稱後來經全體社員的通過所以將「青社」改名爲「新生社」這命名的用意是「遺棄沉悶的舊的生活創造未來的新的生命」</p>
<p>該社社員雖則不多而團結和堅毅的精神刼并未因人少而稍减對於社務的進展猶不遺餘力故該社的前途實未可限量并且在功課百忙中仍然很努力的岀壁報第一期已於上星期三岀版在該報上有這様幾句的話</p>
<p>我們因爲不滿於這生活的平凡單調空氣的沉悶窒塞更不願就這様的消沉下去所以我們就組織了這「新生社」以謀同學間的感情的連絡精神的團結使這平凡而苦悶的學校生活可以改善同時更進一步的希望在將來我們能對於全體同學有所貢獻對於學校有所建樹對於社會有所盡責對於時代的使命有所担任」</p>
<p>於此很可以見其精神的一般了</p>
<p>聞第二期將盡登短小精悍而富趣味的文字以饗讀者現已預定本星期五岀版云</p>
<h3 id="c206">湘贛兩省靑年的危機 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 羅業鴻</p>
<p>湖南江西兩省自從國民革命軍興師以來幾百萬的蒼黎無日不在砲火之中加之最近以來土匪的掠奪弄得兩省十室九空每天岀外逃難的以及餓死的凍死的不下數百萬長沙吉安兩處的事實就可以想見這兩省人民所受的痛苦</p>
<p>兩省的財政不待言是很困難的每月收什麽屠捐·牙税·善後捐等供給政費軍費敎育經費呢每月僅發了四五成已開辦的學校已岌岌可危被土匪已燒毀的學校當然不能開辦好點的敎授他們都跑至天津上海來了社會上經濟旣破產一班痛苦的人民自已求衣食尙不可得怎様還有錢給子弟讀書呢這幾萬的靑年讀書的途徑就走不通了</p>
<p>靑年讀書的途徑旣不通讀了些書認識幾個字只好跑到政界上來鑽一個位置那知現在的政界做事没有人介紹是不能得到的並且現在赤化份子多半是靑年加以政府又不信認靑年謀事的這條路又行不通了</p>
<p>靑年没有書讀没有事謀家中稍爲有點錢的只好到城市中開個小店子借以避難和弄飯吃現在南昌長沙的小舗店天天增加的但是市上人口蕭條除掉買點日常用品外那還有人買零碎東西並且店子一多生意就分散靑年又没有經騐所以虧本居多數加以小小的房間持籌握算的生活没有一點樂趣這條路又不願意走了</p>
<p>靑年從學校中岀來的敎育界多半有師生關係的只好去弄一個小學敎員或者中學辦事員的位置城市中的小學僅二三十校鄕村中小學堂多半燒掉了幾萬的靑年來爭二三十個位置那裏夠分配呢敎育上的路又行不通了</p>
<p>在四邊高牆關着的靑年他們没有謀生活的途徑只好走兩條下落的路</p>
<p>第一條路自殺</p>
<p>第二條路當土匪</p>
<p>最近在湘贛兩省中常常可以看報紙記載靑年自殺的事現在兩省的土匪不都是三十歲以下的靑年被人利用的嗎這幾萬有勇有爲的國民如斯的斷送了實在可惜</p>
<p>我們現在要救濟這兩省的靑年的第一步就要政府從根本上設法救濟救濟的方法很多如設</p>
<p>（一）學生貸欵所眞正没有錢讀書的學生或者因天災而没有錢的學生可以由地方政府證明借與學費</p>
<p>（二）學生職業介紹所剛岀學校門的學生社會一切的門徑渺茫無知政府要就其學校的成續個性介紹工作免得流亡</p>
<p>（三）實行工讀敎育學校一切日常工作顧役使的可以由學生擔任將那筆費用給學生讀書或者在學校中設印刷所製造所以學生課餘的時間來作工</p>
<p>除此以外尙有許多的事可以救濟靑年的只要政府籌劃實行於國家社會則有莫大利益的否則長此以往將來是不堪設想了</p>

<p>Urges Shang Zhen and Others to Come to Tianjin to Discuss Matters</p>
<p>Meeting Between Zhang and Yan Unlikely to Materialize</p>
<p>Tianjin: Zhang Xueliang sent Liu Yi Fei to visit Yan at 4 PM on the 8th, advising him to go abroad early and assuring him that there would be comprehensive arrangements for military and political aftermaths, so he could rest assured. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Zhang Xueliang originally planned to return to Shenyang on the evening of the 8th or the 9th, but due to consecutive lunches and dinners, he has not yet completed his instructions to Wang Shouchang, Liu Yifei, Yu Xuezhong, Shi Yousan, and other generals. In addition, Shang Zhen and Xu Yongchang telegraphed asking if they could come to Tianjin to receive instructions in person. Zhang replied by telegram urging them to come quickly. It is expected that Shang and Xu will arrive in Tianjin within three or two days, so Zhang's return to Shenyang will have to be postponed for up to five days. If Shang and Xu cannot come immediately, Zhang plans to return to Shenyang on the 10th or 11th. On the night of the 7th, Zhang sent Bao Yulin back to Shenyang to report to Zhang Zuoxiang and Rong Zhen the reasons for staying in Tianjin. Shang Lingbai and Liu Guang originally planned to see Zhang off to Beiping, but Zhang decided to send them off to Shenyang. After delaying for three or two days, they will return to Beijing. Liu must represent the Ministry of Military Affairs to issue certificates and deliver a speech since he is about to graduate from the Beiping Army University, so he will not see Zhang off back to Shenyang. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin: A meeting between Yan and Zhang is unlikely to materialize because Yan considers himself to be the commander-in-chief and the leader of Shanxi, unwilling to condescend to visit Zhang. Zhang, on the other hand, believes that Yan has already stepped down and is now a commoner. He himself is currently the Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and is authorized by the Central Government to handle the aftermath of Shanxi and Suiyuan with full authority, so it is difficult for him to move his position to accommodate Yan. However, out of personal friendship, he sent Wang Shuhan as a representative to express his condolences to Yan on the afternoon of the 7th. Yan sent Jia Jingde and Liang Ruzhou as representatives to express his gratitude on the evening of the 7th. Yan's family members are escorted by Wen Shouquan and Su Tiren and are expected to arrive in Tianjin on the 9th. Zhang ordered the Second Army to send Adjutant Jin Weisan and two military policemen to Shijiazhuang on a special train on the evening of the 7th to greet and protect them. It is rumored that Yan plans to cross the sea to the east on the 14th or 15th. (8th Special Telegram)</p>

He does not see visitors, and only five or six close associates such as Liang and Zhao know his address. Wang Shuhan saw Yan at Cui's house on the 7th, guided by Cui beforehand. Zhang and Yan themselves now admit that a meeting is unnecessary. (8th Special Telegram)</p>

When Yan left Tianjin, he disbanded his headquarters and gave each employee two months' salary, and gave Gu Renfa and others 10,000 yuan each, but only 30% of the money was in cash, and the rest was in paper money. Gu and others said that after following Yan for ten years, this is the result, and they have no future, so they complained a lot. (8th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e10">Loans and Diplomatic Relations between France and Italy <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The New York Times reports that the French government will grant Italy the large sums of money it urgently needs in exchange for Italy abandoning its pro-Russian policy and equal naval requirements for France and Italy. According to a Paris telegram, financial circles here have also confirmed part of this news and said that the two governments are now proceeding in this direction. However, political and official circles are still keeping silent. If this news is true, it can be said that Italy's policy is a major change, and the situation in Europe will also change again.</p>
<p>Recent news from Europe includes the new alliance of seven European countries, led by Italy, Russia, and Germany, with France as its enemy. The main connection is the desire to change the reparations in the European war peace treaty. Germany, as the country paying reparations, need not be said. Russia, on the other hand, gets nothing from the reparations. Italy, although it gets something from the reparations, gets relatively little, so their alliance is to deal with France, which gets the most from the reparations. Italy's demonstrations against France and France's military preparations against Italy make the relations between the two countries uneasy. The key lies in this. Now France is using its diplomatic skills to lend large sums of money to Italy to dissolve its alliance with Russia and Germany and to reverse its isolation in Europe in order to maintain its rights gained from victory. If this news can become a reality, it can truly be said to be a major diplomatic success for France in recent times, and its relationship is far from superficial.</p>

<p>One Theory: Baldu is Passive</p>
<p>国民社 (Kuomintang News Agency), Paris, 7th - Senator Baldu's organization of a new cabinet is progressing quite rapidly. Former Prime Minister Taidiou has expressed his willingness to head an important ministry, and former Foreign Minister Briand has also agreed to cooperate. Mr. Baldu paid a visit to the president tonight to report on the progress of the negotiations. It is widely rumored in political circles that former Prime Minister Poincaré told Mr. Baldu that he felt that serving in a ministry in Baldu's cabinet would be physically more suitable than personally serving as prime minister. It is also heard that Mr. Baldu has tried to persuade former cabinet members Helio, Dalai Di'er Xu Dan, Roche, Sal Lau, and Lai Fan'er to join the cabinet. Mr. Helio declined because he was busy dealing with the Lyon earthquake disaster and did not have time to head a ministry. The other two leaders of the Radical Party have not yet responded, but the Radical Party's attitude is generally very sympathetic and seems willing to cooperate with Mr. Baldu. Therefore, the list of the new cabinet members</p>

<p>国民社 (Kuomintang News Agency), Paris, 7th - The French newspapers mostly express satisfaction with the victory of the Brüning cabinet, believing it is another clear demonstration of the rationality of the German Republican parties, showing that their responsible figures are determined to follow a policy of internal stability and external harmony, which is sufficient to safeguard European stability.</p>
<p>国民社 (Kuomintang News Agency), Berlin, 7th - The victory of the Brüning cabinet in the parliament yesterday has been enthusiastically commented on by newspapers across the country today. The German newspaper, the organ of the German National People's Party, juxtaposed the Social Democratic Party's declaration to maintain the cabinet and emergency orders this time with its declaration against the cabinet and emergency orders during the recent election campaign, contrasting them oppositely. The Red Flag newspaper, the organ of the Communist Party, denounced the Social Democratic Party for betraying the workers and its party voters. The Forward newspaper, the organ of the Social Democratic Party, said that of the two evils, it is better to choose the lesser one. Today, it is better to maintain the Brüning cabinet than to open the way for the National Socialist Party to seize power. It seems that it wants to defend the contradiction between the party's previous and subsequent attitudes and dispel the criticism of betraying the workers. As for the newspapers of the government party, they all exaggerated and expressed great satisfaction.</p>

<p>The Minseito Party Decides to Maintain the Status Quo with Hara</p>
<p>電通社 (Dentsu News Agency), Tokyo, 8th - Minseito Party advisor Yamamoto Tatsuo visited Saionji Kinmochi at the Okitsu villa at 6:00 PM on the 6th for a confidential discussion of more than three hours. He returned to Tokyo at 1:00 PM on the 7th. The content of the earnest discussion between Saionji and Yamamoto is of great importance to the political situation. Yamamoto believed that Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition made it difficult to guarantee that he would be able to attend parliament, and the debate about the successor president and the establishment of a vice-president was intensifying. Some of the younger members of the party supported Interior Minister Adachi, while others supported Army Minister Ugaki. If Foreign Minister Hara were to act as prime minister and attend parliament, it would not be a good plan, so he felt uneasy. At this time, in order to consolidate the party's end-of-term stability and the stability of the situation, he reported the opinions of Yamamoto himself and the Minseito Party executives to Saionji Kinmochi, and brought back Saionji's opinions. It is heard that Saionji and Yamamoto unanimously advocated that in order to avoid various campaigns and party turmoil at this time, a vice-president should not be established. Even if Prime Minister Hamaguchi cannot attend parliament, maintaining the status quo is the best policy. Therefore, it was decided to have the neutral Foreign Minister Hara act as prime minister and respond to parliament. After returning to Tokyo yesterday, Yamamoto told people that although it was at night, because they had not met for a long time, the conversation lasted for three hours. The prime minister's condition was as stated by Doctors Manabe and Shiota. Therefore, before he fully recovers, it is still necessary to have a deputy prime minister. Hara will act as prime minister until the parliament meeting. However, there is no reason why he would act as prime minister before the parliament meeting but not act as prime minister after the parliament meeting. Judging from foreign examples, it is extremely common and appropriate for the foreign minister, an important cabinet member, to act as prime minister. I think there will be no other changes after this.</p>

<p>国民社 (Kuomintang News Agency), Washington, 7th - The Department of Commerce released a report today stating that U.S.-China trade has improved. The Chinese civil war has ended, and the world is working to consolidate silver prices. General optimism is based on this. According to today's report, the silk industry has seen a slight improvement due to improved market conditions. U.S. exports are also gradually increasing. According to qualified observers here, unofficially, China's tax rules are also beneficial to general commerce because higher tax rates are sufficient to consolidate the financial position of the Nanjing government, so the Nanjing government will not crack down on imported goods. People here have been paying more attention to China's commercial situation recently because the subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, chaired by Pittman, investigated the reasons for the decline in U.S.-China trade this summer and also addressed the silver market.</p>

<p>Inspection Team Members Returning from China</p>
<p>Express Opinions on Chinese Industry</p>
<p>国民社 (Kuomintang News Agency), Berlin Special Correspondence - The Association of Chinese Electrical and Mechanical Engineers in Germany held its annual meeting here. In addition to the presence of Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zuobin, German industrialists, financiers, scholars, and people from all walks of life, the German inspection team members who recently returned from China made their first public presentation on the results of their inspection. After the opening of the meeting, Jiang Zuobin delivered a speech, followed by Mr. Liu reading the annual report for the past year. Then, Mr. Schroeder, a member of the inspection team, expressed his observations on Chinese industry, saying that China has indeed made considerable progress in recent years. If the planned steps can be implemented one by one, China's economic prosperity can be expected soon. The most urgent reforms and expansions in China are railways, shipping administration, transportation, communications, and general industries. However, as long as those in power can do their best, the necessary funds can be raised without difficulty. I firmly believe that when your country is engaged in development, there will be no shortage of domestic professionals who are knowledgeable and capable of running large-scale factories, and there will also be many foreign engineering talents willing to contribute their efforts to assist in this great transformation. Mr. Schroeder also said that although China is known as a rice-producing country, the food it imports every year is still continuous, with a value exceeding several million. China is the richest country in the world in coal production, but most of the coal it uses is imported from abroad. This phenomenon is very regrettable. After Mr. Schroeder finished speaking, Professor Dietmo, a member of the committee, gave a speech entitled "China's Electrical Industry." The professor brought many prepared diagrams showing the disparity in power supply in various cities in China after sunrise and after sunset, proving that most of the electricity in China is focused on lighting purposes. Except for the Shanghai Power Company, the other power stations are not worth adopting. I predict that one day, power lines will crisscross the sky and connect the entire China into one. At that time, the use of electricity will be widespread in various industries. At present, the wages of Chinese workers, whether skilled or unskilled, are relatively low, but they are showing an upward trend. As a result, various workshops will need more and more electricity. However, China's own establishment of large-scale power stations may not be possible in a short period of time, so most of the current supply of electrical equipment still needs to be transported from other countries. Finally, Dr. Windell, the chairman of the committee, expressed his observations on the Chinese steel industry, saying that to discuss China's steel industry, it is enough to cite the example of the Hanyeping Iron Works, which has now been shut down, to see the history of China's steel industry. There are several reasons for the failure of the factory. Those who start steel industries not only need huge amounts of funds, but also need to be familiar with the sources of steel ore and the supply of coal for fuel, as well as the transportation location of these raw materials. When starting operations, they must have sufficient financial resources as a backup. If financial resources are exhausted, there will inevitably be many thorny problems, and eventually it will be shut down. There are a total of seven steelmaking furnaces in China, but none of them are currently idle. However, it should be known that past failures cannot be an obstacle to the future. If those who are interested in this endeavor can have a comprehensive and precise plan and sufficient financial resources in advance, then this industry will eventually have a bright future. According to Zhong Hongde, the president of the association, although the association is organized by Chinese engineering students and Chinese engineers serving in factories in Germany, and currently has only more than 50 members, he expects that the number of members next year will increase significantly. It is currently considering merging with other Chinese engineering associations in Germany. Also, the number of Chinese students coming to Germany to practice urban design, sanitation administration, and other architectural technicians is increasing day by day. In the future, they may join the association, and at that time the number of members will be ten times the current number. All the inspection reports of the German industrial inspection team are now being translated into Chinese by Mr. Li, the former president of the association who works at Siemens, and Mr. Zhong, the current president, and will be published in the Chinese Engineering Magazine, which will be launched in January next year.

Thirty-two workers in the Tanna Tunnel were frightened and ran out. Only forty workers entered the tunnel yesterday, and restoration work is unlikely to progress.</p>

<p>All Newspaper Offices are Aware - The disaster in Henan is extremely serious, and the people are in dire straits. I have telegraphed asking you to issue a large amount of money to quickly release emergency relief. I am grateful for your attention. Yesterday, Zhenhua returned to Henan from Beijing and personally visited the disaster area. Most of the people were displaced, and half of the villages were in ruins. Mournful cries were everywhere, and starving corpses filled the roads. All kinds of tragic scenes were heartbreaking. Now it is winter, and the survivors after the snowy disaster are suffering from cold and hunger. If we do not provide emergency relief, they will all fill the ditches. Therefore, I am appealing again, requesting that you quickly raise a large amount of money and allocate it quickly. This is what the 30 million people of Henan Province are crying out for day and night. I sincerely request that you understand. Liu Zhenhua kowtows in Yang.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Central Party and National Government Memorial Week <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 8th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 89th Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the Great Hall. Central Committee members Ye Chuqiang, Ma Chaojun, Yu Jingtang, Miao Peicheng, and other officials and guests from various departments and offices, totaling about 560 people, attended. Chairman Ye Chuqiang presided over the ceremony. After the ceremony, the chairman reported briefly that, according to the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session, the political report will be changed to a speech on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and work report every Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. The chairman believes that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings are the only basis for all the work of party members. In the party's doctrines he revealed, we must study with the most sincere spirit at all times and cannot leave it for a day, and we must not abandon our research efforts after the measurement is completed and become lazy. Now, during the period of political tutelage, all government facilities are based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. Once verified, all questions can be answered without much explanation. I have selected several recent matters to briefly report to my comrades: (1) The Executive Yuan issued an order to rectify the academic atmosphere. The main purpose is to enable students to cultivate their character, work hard in their studies, and enable teachers to cultivate their character and encourage their behavior. The deterioration of the school spirit in recent times is due to the background of the reactionaries, who often create rumors that the Kuomintang does not want students to confuse students with weak minds who are easily affected and cannot help but doubt. It must be known that the reactionaries' need for students is very different from what our party wants. The reactionaries want to use students to blindly follow and echo as their tools for reaction, while our party wants students to concentrate on learning and become useful talents for the country, so that they can take on major undertakings in the future. Looking back thirteen years ago, Dr. Sun Yat-sen gave speeches to encourage students in Lingnan, emphasizing that students should concentrate on their studies during their studies and lay the foundation from the root, and his words were extremely earnest. Therefore, this order of the Executive Yuan can also be said to be in memory of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. (2) The local administration is very inconsistent. There is often a property committee organized in a county, which includes representatives of the county party headquarters, representatives of various district chiefs, representatives of various bureau chiefs, and the county government. The powers are complex and incomprehensible. The party headquarters has the position of supervising the government and has a guiding nature over local administration. The nature of each district and bureau is also different, but they all participate in the organization, which is not in line with the system. Also, there have been cases where the county chief has gathered several county chiefs to hold a meeting to solve a part of the political problems. This method is even more bizarre. When a county's government affairs encounter problems that cannot be solved on its own, it should be submitted to the superior agency for handling. However, they are acting on their own, and the administrative system will be broken by them, which will have a small impact on politics. The central government is rigorously implementing unified politics, and this kind of thing that violates unity must be curbed. The chairman also feels that the central government uses all necessary policies internally and externally and adopts various effective methods to issue orders and decrees. All measures are well-rounded without being confined to formality. In each province and county, local administration must follow a formality, neatly implement the central government's laws and decrees. Even if there are extraordinary talents, they should also be subject to the constraints of laws and decrees and should not go beyond the laws and decrees. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said in his teachings that all state organs must obey discipline and respect the system, so that politics can have good results. According to this, the above-mentioned organizations that are not in line with the system should undoubtedly be corrected. (3) The lower-level party headquarters feel that it is very difficult to deal with the workers' movement. The workers have always regarded the capitalists as their targets. If the handling is slightly ahead, the workers will leave the party. If lower-level people have problems with the party headquarters, it may lead to labor-capital disputes. Recently, a certain place has a small rope-making industry that is employed by shopkeepers. This kind of industry is very bitter. Although the shopkeepers are slightly more well-off, they are not worth mentioning among the capitalists. However, after the trade union was organized, the first step was to ask for an increase in wages. The shopkeepers thought that this method would force them into bankruptcy, so they would rather let the workers be the shopkeepers and change themselves to be workers. This is really difficult to solve. However, a considerable method can be obtained by examining Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. 1. The party headquarters should adopt an objective position in the face of the mass movement, assess the situation, and seek a good understanding of the changing situation, without deciding according to its own ideas, resulting in haste. 2. The reason why domestic industry and commerce cannot develop is actually due to the invasion of imperialists. We should broaden our horizons and try to lead the workers to increase domestic production, and we should not simply target domestic capitalists and forget the enemies who are hindering the development of our industry and commerce, etc. After the report, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>On the same morning, at 10:00 AM, the National Government held Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Dai Chuanxian, Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, Wang Boqun, Wang Zhengting, Ma Fuxiang, Liu Ruiheng, Lin Xiang, Zhu Luhe, Chen Yi, Zhou Yawei, Zhang Wohua, Chen Yu, and other officials and staff from the National Government's civil service and military departments, totaling more than 200 people, attended. Chairman Dai Chuanxian presided over the ceremony, and Dai gave a speech until 11:00 AM, when the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Kong Xiangxi Resigns as Minister of Industry <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The newly appointed Minister of Industry, Kong Xiangxi, submitted to the National Government, saying that he, Xiangxi, had humbly accepted the important task with his humble talent, but was worried about the limitations of his abilities. In the summer of the 17th year, he was ordered to go to Ping Province to see Dr. Sun Yat-sen's coffin and negotiate the post-war affairs in the North. He suffered from enteritis after running around. After the operation, the doctor originally asked him to rest quietly, but because of the responsibilities of his position, he could not relax at all. He continued to work, but unexpectedly, he felt uncomfortable from then on and felt that the arduous task was beyond his capabilities. He repeatedly thought about asking to resign to seek recuperation, but because of repeated rebellions, the party and the country were in trouble, and there was no opportunity to speak out. Since the summer of this year, he has been thinking about the dangerous situation and has suffered from stomach and heart problems. Although he has been repeatedly granted leave to seek treatment, he still recovers and relapses from time to time. According to the doctor, he cannot recover without several months of recuperation. Recently, the military has been pacified and peace has reappeared. The Fourth Plenary Session of this year has been held, and it has been decided to merge the two ministries of agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce into one Ministry of Industry in accordance with the times. Fortunately, from then on, the responsibilities will be lifted and there will be an opportunity to recuperate. It was unexpected that the Central Committee would assign Xiangxi to the Ministry of Industry because he had previously served as Minister of Industry in Guangdong. Upon hearing the order, he was deeply terrified. Thinking back to the beginning of Xiangxi's leadership of industry and commerce, he once followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and the party's policies to formulate administrative guidelines as the standard for measures. Unfortunately, the country has experienced many misfortunes, and the economy is in difficulty. Not only are there many large projects that require funds and are still pending, but even the simple projects have not been fully realized. This is not the intention of the government to set up officials, nor does it violate Xiangxi's devotion to his duties. Every time I think about it, I can't help but walk around the room anxiously and can't sleep. If I were to take on the responsibilities of the entire Ministry of Industry again with my body that has not recovered from a long illness, I would only become more involved in trivial matters and cause more mistakes, and I am afraid that I would fail the Central Committee's intention to work hard for construction. Moreover, at this time when the Central Committee has completed the unification and concentrated talents, it is even more appropriate to give way to wait for the virtuous and capable. Therefore, after thinking again and again, it is better to resign today than to struggle in the future. I humbly and sincerely submit to you, hoping that you will understand my sincerity and withdraw the order, so that I can recuperate with peace of mind. Once I recover, I will still make plans to repay you. I am extremely sincere and awaiting orders.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Zhang Fang's Proposals for Henan Disaster Relief <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Request to the Central Government for Continued Issuance of Disaster Relief Bonds of Ten Million</p>
<p>Henan's natural disasters are extremely severe, compounded by the ravages of war this summer. The people are displaced and dying, and the Central Plains are almost turned into barren land. Zhang Fang, Chairman of the Henan Disaster Relief Association, has come to Beijing this time to appeal for relief from all parties. He has also drafted five relief proposals to petition the central government. The following is a transcript of the document presented to the National Government: "It is found that Henan Province is located in the Central Plains, connecting several provinces and is known as a region of four battles. It has repeatedly suffered from the scourge of war. Since the ninth year of the Republic, droughts, floods, locust plagues, and hailstorms have occurred frequently. Heavy taxes and levies have exhausted the people's resources, and production has declined daily. The hardship situation in recent years is difficult to describe in words. Just when we were expecting the success of the revolution to free the people from the sea of suffering, unexpected disasters followed one after another, gathering in the Central Plains. The fierceness of this war and the magnitude of the losses are unprecedented catastrophes. All the war zones have been described in detail by the Henan Provincial Disaster Relief Association and Henan people. Now, focusing on the counties most severely affected by the disaster, such as Kaifeng, Chenliu, Qi County, Tongxu, Weishi, Weichuan, Yanling, Zhongmu, Lanfeng, Yu County, Mi County, Shangqiu, Ningling, Sui County, Luyi, Zhecheng, Xihua, Taikang, Kaocheng, Xuchang, Fugou, Linying, Yancheng, Zheng County, Changge, Xiang County, Xingyang, Xingze, Sishui, Tangyin, Xinzheng, Minquan, Luoyang, Yanshi, Gong County, Mengjin, Dengfeng, Linru, Xinan, Mianchi, Baofeng, Yiyang, Pingdengziyou, Shan County, Lingbao, Wenxiang, and other forty-eight counties, a relief plan and estimated funding requirements are formulated as follows, and are hereby submitted for review and speedy implementation to secure the displaced and save the survivors: (1) It is appropriate to establish porridge kitchens and women and children shelters in the above-mentioned counties. It is found that the villages in the war-stricken counties have been reduced to ruins, and the people are displaced. Now, in the severe winter, they are suffering from hunger and cold and are on the verge of death. It is urgent to provide emergency relief to recruit the displaced and extend their lives. It is proposed to set up four shelters and porridge kitchens in each county to accommodate the elderly, weak, women, and children to eat porridge at the factories until the wheat harvest in June next year. A total of forty-eight counties will need 3,000 yuan per month per factory, totaling 4,032,000 yuan. The provision of cotton clothing is not yet included. (2) Fill in war trenches, repair motor roads and the Yellow River dikes to replace relief with labor. It is found that trenches and fortifications within the war zone extend for hundreds of miles, with depths and widths of more than ten feet, destroying tens of thousands of acres of fertile land. It is proposed to investigate separately and retain those that can be used to create ditches for water conservancy. The rest should be filled in using labor as relief within a specified period to restore fertile land, requiring approximately 1,500,000 yuan. At the same time, the motor roads in the war zone should be repaired, from Kaifeng east to Guide and south to Zhoukou, requiring approximately 600,000 yuan. In recent years, the Yellow River dike projects, such as the Liuyuankou and Ligangkou areas, are in imminent danger. It is also necessary to plan for 2,000,000 yuan for major repairs to strengthen the river defenses and relieve the disaster victims. (3) Establish price equalization bureaus to stabilize grain prices. It is found that the soaring grain prices are a cause for concern, especially in the western Henan area. It is proposed to establish price equalization bureaus in multiple locations to purchase large quantities of rice and wheat from Jiangsu, Hubei, and Anhui and set up price equalization to relieve the people's food shortage, requiring approximately 500,000 yuan. (4) Plan to lend cattle, tools, and seeds. It is found that in this war, whether in the front line or in the rear defense counties, cattle and tools have been requisitioned without exception, and food has been completely searched. The sowing season for wheat has already passed. In the blink of an eye, the spring sowing season is approaching, and there is a lack of spring grain seeds, which is also a cause for concern. It is urgent to prepare seeds and cattle tools and lend them to poor farmers so that they can resume farming, requiring approximately 600,000 yuan. (5) Plan to continue to transfer disaster victims to Shandong Province for food. It is found that Henan Province has transferred more than 70,000 disaster victims in recent years. Henan people have obtained food in Shandong Province, which benefits both border defense and people's livelihood. It is still appropriate to prepare large amounts of funds to transfer a large number of people during this disaster, which is a fundamental and essential plan, requiring approximately 1,500,000 yuan. The above-mentioned urgent projects and relief measures are all essential measures at present, and the relief for this winter and next spring has also been taken into consideration. The relief funds required will not be separately raised again. The required relief funds are calculated at the lowest limit, totaling 10,733,000 yuan. I earnestly request that you consider the disaster victims and approve the appropriation or follow the example of issuing public bonds to relieve the Shaanxi disaster and continue to issue public bonds of 10,000,000 yuan specifically for Henan relief. If 5,000,000 yuan can be issued first within the next three months, it can also maintain the proposed plan. Whether it is appropriate or not is respectfully submitted for your decision."</p>
<h3 id="e76">Zhang Xueliang's Situation Passing Through Jinan <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang stayed in Beijing this time due to consultations on the aftermath of Northern military affairs, until he left Beijing on the afternoon of the 4th. He crossed the Yangtze River in Pukou and boarded the train, which departed at 8:20 pm. Today (the 5th), he arrived in Jinan at 7:15 pm. Zhang's special train had a total of four carriages. The first carriage was a pilot car, the "Great Wall" armored car, which opened first. The second carriage was a guard car. Zhang's carriage was the third, and the attendant car was the fourth. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Jinan at 5:30 pm today, but the engine was delayed by two hours due to coal loading in Bengbu, so it did not arrive in Jinan until 7:15 pm. The pilot "Great Wall" armored car arrived in Jinan at 6:15 pm, the guard car arrived at 6:45 pm, and the attendant car arrived at 7:45 pm. The provincial government had been informed of Zhang's arrival in Jinan in advance and dispatched military police to guard the station inside and outside. From the station along Pulimen, Daxi Gate, to the provincial government, the posts were densely arranged, and pedestrians were prohibited from passing. Welcoming personnel were required to wear the symbols issued by the provincial government, and even cars passing through were subject to inspection. Around 6 o'clock, the welcoming personnel arrived at the station one after another, including Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu, Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun, Finance Director Wang Xiangrong, Agriculture and Mining Director Wang Fangting, Construction Director Zhang Honglie, High Court President Wu Zhenzan, 14th Army Commander Cao Fulin, 12th Army Commander Sun Tongxuan, 22nd Division Commander Gu Liangmin, Provincial Committee Zhang Yue, General Headquarters Chief of Staff Li Zongbi, and others, totaling about a hundred people. At 7:15 pm, Zhang's special train entered the station, and the military music played loudly. After the car stopped, Bao Wenwei, the Chief of Staff of the Staff Office, first invited the welcomers to the living room car. Bao said that the Deputy Commander was slightly suffering from stomach problems due to acclimatization in Beijing. Han Fuqu said that he planned to invite the Deputy Commander to rest in Jinan for a few days. Bao said that the Deputy Commander was anxious to return to Liaoning and was afraid that he could not get off the car. Then Zhang immediately went to the living room car from the 15th chartered car and exchanged greetings with the welcomers one by one. Han Fuqu first asked the Deputy Commander if his health was good in Beijing. Zhang replied that it was very good, but he was slightly suffering from stomach problems due to acclimatization. The climate in the central government was excellent, and the various agencies were also working very hard. Han then asked Zhang to get off the car for a rest. Zhang replied that he had stayed in Beijing for too long. Marshal Zhang has been in Liaoning for two months, and Marshal Zhang cannot return to Jilin without my return to Liaoning, so I must hurry back to Liaoning and cannot get off the car. Even in Tianjin, I will only stay for half a day. Today, I saw Ma Shaoyun in Tai'an and wanted to get off the car to climb Mount Tai, but I could not fulfill my wish due to the pursuit of the schedule. I have been to Jinan once before, but I have passed by Tai'an and Qufu twice and did not have time to get off the car. I plan to go to Beijing again in March or April, and I will definitely stay in Shandong for a few days to fulfill my long-cherished wish to climb Mount Tai and visit the Confucius Temple. I heard that the Confucius Temple, Mencius Temple, and Confucius Forest were damaged by artillery fire this time, which is related to the culture of our country and is watched by both Chinese and foreigners, so we should raise funds to repair it as soon as possible. Han asked if Commander-in-Chief Jiang had left. Zhang replied that he was scheduled to go to Jiujiang this morning. Han asked how the aftermath of Shanxi was. Zhang replied that Yan had arrived in Tianjin and lived in the Japanese concession. Although Feng knew that he had left Jin, he still did not know where he was going. He had already telegraphed Shang Qiyu to entrust him to inquire about Feng's intentions. Originally, I had already agreed with Commander-in-Chief Jiang to earnestly telegraph Yan Feng to guarantee his safety for his resignation and going abroad. Han said that Shi Hanzhang is now waiting in Tianjin for the Deputy Commander. In the future, Mr. Feng (Yuxiang) and Hanzhang will rely on the Deputy Commander's great efforts to mediate. Zhang replied that he would do his best to protect their safety. He also asked about the situation in Shandong. Han replied that it was still calm, but there were local bandits in southern Shandong, and the Third Route Army had sent a brigade to encircle them together with Ma Shaoyun's troops. Zhang asked if Sun Lianzhong's troops had arrived. Han replied that the troops arrived in Caozhou on the 2nd and Jining on the 3rd. Zhang nodded again and again. Han said that Shandong affairs all rely on the Deputy Commander's guidance. Zhang said that there was no need to be polite. At this point in the conversation, the welcomers got off the car, leaving only Han in the car. After another five minutes of conversation, Han got off the car. At 7:15 pm, the guard car headed north first (the pilot "Great Wall" armored car stayed in Jinan and did not go north with it). At 7:45 pm, Zhang's special train headed north amidst the music and farewell. Zhang stood outside the car door and nodded to the welcomers as a courtesy. The attendant car headed north at 8:15 pm. Those who escorted the car included She Xu, Director of the Jinpu Railway Car Affairs Office, Li Guozhou, Director of the Locomotive General Section, Gu Qiwen, Zhang Yuanhe, etc. (Evening of December 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Feng and Yan's Whereabouts After Leaving Shanxi <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Feng Secretly Arrives in Suiyuan and Enters Kulun</p>
<p>Yan Disguised Passes Through Datong and Goes to Tianjin</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The news of Feng's departure from Shanxi has been rumored for a long time. Feng secretly left Jin on the 25th of last month. It is reported that Feng arrived in Suiyuan the day after he left Jin and made some arrangements there. On the 28th, he took two cars with two Russian translators and two followers and went north to Russia via Kulun. Due to the difficulty of the journey, the followers he brought were also simplified. As for whether he will recuperate in Russia or transfer to Europe, there is no news at this time. According to a friend who returned from Suiyuan, Feng's whereabouts were extremely secret this time. After arriving in Suiyuan, he ordered all the followers to change into plain clothes. Although he stayed in Suiyuan for two days, no one outside knew about it. Only after he left did the outside world know a little about it. It is conceivable how secret his whereabouts were.</p>
<p>After Yan received Zhang Xueliang's telegram guaranteeing his safety along the way, he was determined to leave Jin. However, at that time, for Yan's safety, the official kept secret the exact time of Yan's departure. Some said that he had indeed left on the 30th of last month, and some said that he only left yesterday. According to reliable news, Yan did indeed leave on the night of the 29th of last month in disguise (wearing a Western suit) with three followers in two cars and secretly went north to Datong. He then took a passenger car on the PingSui Railway to Ping and transferred to Tianjin. Zhao Daiwen received a telegram in Wutai that Yan had safely arrived in Tianjin, and only then did he telegraph Shang Zhen yesterday to ask him to telegraph the Central Government and Deputy Commander Zhang to report and notify all agencies in the city. At the same time, he also sent a special commissioner to Shijiazhuang to ask Wang Shuchang's Chen Chief of Staff and Yu Xuezhong's Chief of Staff, who had been sent by Pingjin to meet Yan, not to come to Jin. After Shang received the telegram, he immediately complied, and the news of Yan Feng's departure from Jin, which had been rumored for many days, came to an end.</p>
<p>Since Yan and Feng have left Jin one after another, the most important issue after that is naturally to handle the aftermath. It is reported that Shang Zhen, Xu Yongchang, and others are currently deliberating on the distribution of military pay, the reorganization of finance, the reorganization of troops, and the division of defense areas in order to discuss them with Deputy Commander Zhang one by one (December 2nd).</p>
<h3 id="e78">Communist Party Organizations Repeatedly Crushed in Hunan Province <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Many Important Figures Captured</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Although the Communist bandits in various parts of Hunan Province have been defeated separately, the Communist Party members are still lurking and thinking of acting, secretly forming organizations in an attempt to sabotage the Changsha Fortress, electric light yarn factories, and instigate students, workers, soldiers to organize reactionary groups to expand the riot plan. After strict investigation by the Rural Clearing Headquarters, several pseudo-provincial, county, and municipal organizations were recently cracked down in the provincial capital and Matang Jinggang and other places in Changsha County, and many important figures were captured. Yesterday, He Jian telegraphed to the Central Government to report the situation of cracking down on the Communist Party organizations as follows: "The Communist bandits who previously invaded the province were severely suppressed by the troops and various armies, and although they fled in different directions, the Communist Party members still tried to make trouble and secretly formed organizations. After strict investigation by the sent teams, several pseudo-provincial, county, and municipal organizations were recently cracked down in the provincial capital and Matang Jinggang and other places in Changsha County, and Liu Shaoqing, the wife of Wang Shoudao, the pseudo-provincial committee member, Liu Huilan, the wife of Yu Muming, the pseudo-provincial committee member, and Ou Zhenfan, Lin Youxin, Peng Daosheng and other key criminals, the pseudo-municipal and county committee members, were captured, and many pseudo-central, provincial, municipal, and county notices and reactionary publications were seized. The contents of the pseudo-notices are extremely cunning for sabotaging the Changsha Fortress, electric light yarn factories, and instigating students, workers, soldiers to organize reactionary groups to expand the riot plan. After interrogation, the responsible key bandits also confessed that they were ordered to set up organizations in secret organizations in an attempt to directly attack Changsha and invade Wuhan. In addition to handling the captured Communist bandits in accordance with the law, we have also sent letters to the military and political organs to strictly guard against them. He Jian, Commander of Hunan Rural Clearing, kowtows and thanks the seal."</p>
<h3 id="e79">Liaoning Province Decides to Issue Prize-Winning Bonds <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Establishment of the Six-Percent Bond Committee</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: In recent years, the financial situation in the Northeast has been tight, and local industries have seen depression. As a result, many merchants and farmers from various counties have come to the province to request loans for turnover. There are as many as forty county groups making this request. Among them, some have petitioned the provincial government's Finance Department, and some have contacted the Chamber of Commerce and various banks. The Liaoning legal groups previously planned to issue prize-winning bonds to relieve merchants and farmers, which was approved by the chairman of the province, Zang Shiyi. A meeting was held in the provincial government to discuss this matter. In addition to Chairman Zang, Chen Wenxue, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Liu Heling, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Mining, Peng Xiangting, President of the Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces, Lu Muting, General Manager, Wang Huayi, President of the Education Association, Ji Jinsheng, President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Jin Zhechen, and Huang Heng Hao, representatives from the Department of Finance, etc. After a long discussion on the importance of the matter, the following resolutions were made: (1) It is proposed to issue bonds of 20,000,000 yuan with a monthly interest rate of six percent, paid every four months and recovered in three years. (2) First, a Liaoning Six-Percent Bond Committee will be organized by various agencies and legal groups to carry out various matters. Zang Shiyi, the chairman of the province, was elected as the chairman of the committee. (3) There are many difficulties in printing bonds. Due to time constraints, it was decided to use the 100-yuan Feng banknotes of the official bank that were not signed as 2-yuan bonds, signed and stamped for identification. (4) The various conditions will be telegraphed by Chairman Zang to Deputy Commander Zhang for approval and submitted to the Northeast Political Committee for approval before implementation. (5) The loan method will be handled by the official banks in each county, with one supervisor in each county to prevent local tyrants and evil gentry from profiting from it. If there is any usury or exploitation, they will be severely punished. (6) These bonds are universally applicable to officials, merchants, and farmers. The Finance Department and various tax bureaus will also accept them for tax collection (December 2nd).</p>
<h3 id="e80">Trend of Timber Merchants in Chuzhou Resisting Levies <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Department of Finance Increases Timber Levies Threefold</p>
<p>All Timber Merchants Go on Strike for Two Months</p>
<p>More Than Ten Thousand Workers Lose Their Jobs</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Chuzhou in eastern Zhejiang is located in the mountains and is a hub for the production of timber. Among the ten subordinate counties, Longquan, Qingyuan, and Jingning are the most famous. The annual sales to Ouhang and the Yangtze River Basin are worth about six to seven million gold. The people rely on this income to exchange cloth and rice to support their lives. However, in recent years, due to the impact of war and Communist bandits, they have suffered huge losses, both tangible and intangible, and their livelihoods have become increasingly difficult. Local business groups are planning to provide relief to alleviate the people's difficulties. Unexpectedly, the Department of Finance ordered the United Taxation Bureaus of Qingtian, Lishui, and Longquan to increase the timber levy in order to increase tax revenue. When the timber merchants heard this, they were all alarmed and at a loss. For this reason, they stopped transporting timber to seek resistance. So far, it has been nearly two months, and more than ten thousand workers have lost their jobs. The source of economic income is about to be cut off, and the cash shops and commercial shops have shown signs of poor turnover. If a solution is not found quickly, the social security and people's livelihood will be a cause for concern. The process is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Increasing the Levy: It is found that the United Taxation Bureaus of Longquan, Lishui, and Qingtian rely entirely on timber as the main source of tax collection. The Department of Finance needs funds urgently and has increased the quota of each bureau every year.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>The former Director of the Qingtian United Taxation Bureau, Guo, resigned on the pretext of a tax revenue shortfall. The vacant position was taken over by Qu Dasan. Director Qu realized that the previous director's collection was not strong, so he increased the timber levy, completely overturning the established case of extracting five per thousand for more than ten years and 3.9 li per piece. He submitted a request to the Department of Finance to increase the levy rate. The Department of Finance immediately instructed to approve it, and the same was true for the Longquan and Lishui Bureaus, which inevitably had a knock-on effect. As a result, the announcement of the increased levy was posted all over the streets.</p>
<p>The Situation of Stopping Transportation: Timber merchants in Longquan, Qingyuan, and Jingning believe that at this time when the cut in the likin is about to be realized, there is suddenly an increase in the levy. Regardless of the cost of the timber, the original tax of 3 fen for white timber has been increased by 9 fen, and the original tax of 4.5 li for pine timber and miscellaneous wood has been increased by 1 jiao and 2 fen. The levy rate has been increased by three times according to the original tax, becoming a levy rate of 15 or 20 per thousand, which is considered to be in great conflict with the payment of inland tax regulations and is difficult to accept. Therefore, they unanimously stopped transporting timber as a passive resistance. The timber stacked along the river is increasing by tens of thousands every day, and the loss is conceivable.</p>
<p>The Process of Petitioning: In addition to implementing the stop of transportation, the timber merchants also demanded that the chambers of commerce in the respective places discuss countermeasures. After the chambers of commerce and timber merchants described their various hardships, they separately petitioned the Ministry of Finance and the Department of Finance to allow the electricity to be ordered to collect taxes as before in order to maintain the established case. On the one hand, they elected representatives Liu Yucheng, Li Zhongxian, etc. to go to the province to petition. As a result, the Department of Finance only allowed personnel to thoroughly investigate and deliberate on the matter again. The representatives believed that the purpose had not been achieved and planned to go to Beijing to continue petitioning.</p>
<p>Now the Department of Finance has specially appointed Yao Chong to conduct a thorough investigation due to the firm opposition of the timber merchants and promised to have the power to mediate according to the situation. Therefore, when Yao arrived in Qingtian, he deeply understood the inside story of various kinds, and then formulated a compromise plan. The timber merchants could not afford to bear the increase of 9 fen of tax, and it would be detrimental to the government's prestige if no increase was made at all. Approximately, at least 2 fen must be added as a transitional step. He has sought the opinions of the timber merchants' representatives on this matter, but the representatives insisted that the order must be completely revoked, so Yao is still lingering in Qingtian, engaged in dredging.</p>

<p>Changsha Year-End Closure Extended: Changsha has been repeatedly looted by the Guizhou rebels and the communist bandits, and commerce has been sluggish. With the government promoting the Gregorian calendar, it is particularly difficult to close the year-end accounts on time. It is reported that various commercial groups have mostly resolved to extend the closure period to the day before the Beginning of Spring.</p>
<p>Correction: It was incorrectly stated yesterday in the Jiangyin communication that the rear hospital was about to close. Wu Handuo, an adjutant sent by the Headquarters' Committee for the Management of Wounded and Sick Officers and Soldiers to Cheng, was handling the discharge of wounded soldiers and not the closure of the rear hospital. An urgent correction is made. Important Educational News</p>
<h3 id="e93">Statement of Wang Keren, Supervisor of Students Studying in Japan <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Disputes Over Student Affairs in Japan</p>
<p>The disputes over student affairs in Japan have long been reported in various newspapers. It is now known that Wang Keren, the supervisor of students studying in Japan, arrived in Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru the day before yesterday. A reporter from the New Sound Society immediately visited Mr. Wang at the Great China Hotel. According to Mr. Wang, student affairs in Japan are extremely difficult to handle. Whenever students from any province encounter financial difficulties, they go to the supervisor's office for loans, all assuming that the supervisor's office is a government agency. How could it be that they would turn a deaf ear to the difficulties of their own country's students in a foreign land without offering assistance? Even provincial managers, when their province's public funds fail to arrive on time, often come to the supervisor's office to find a solution, also believing that the supervisor's office is an agency that manages all students studying abroad. Now that students from a certain province are in difficulty, the supervisor's office cannot easily shirk responsibility and ignore them. Such situations are very difficult to deal with. The current dispute is based on this. Here, I will briefly address three issues:</p>
<p>First, the issue of loans from the Nichi-Ka Gakkai (Japan-China Society). The Nichi-Ka Gakkai is essentially a private organization specializing in Japan-China educational affairs. In June of this year, Hunan and Jiangxi's public funds failed to arrive on schedule. Therefore, Deng Tianmin, the manager of Jiangxi Province, negotiated with the Nichi-Ka Gakkai for a loan of 5,000 yuan. The Jiangxi manager borrowed 3,000 yuan, and the Hunan manager borrowed 1,200 yuan, each writing their own promissory notes to collect the money themselves. I only signed the promissory notes as a guarantor. In addition to these 4,200 yuan, the supervisor's office also borrowed 800 yuan, originally intended to meet the urgent needs of Guangxi and Hubei's government-funded students. Later, upon receiving a telegram from the Ministry of Education approving the allocation of funds for the return travel expenses of government-funded students from Hunan, Guangxi, and other provinces, it was decided that the funds could be used flexibly for Guangxi students. Hubei Province had already received its own provincial funds, so there was no need to borrow further. Unexpectedly, Luo Yiqun, the manager of Guangdong Province, also came to borrow money, so I had no choice but to borrow the funds from the Nichi-Ka Gakkai again to meet Mr. Luo's urgent needs. The process included handwritten letters from the Hunan and Jiangxi managers, which can be verified. Moreover, Deng Tianming reported the loan progress at the student affairs meeting, which can be verified in the meeting minutes. This was not a deceitful act. I believe that I have made no mistakes and that there are no irregularities. Those who are unaware of this process have assumed that the supervisor's office received subsidies from the Japanese Cultural Affairs Department and that the Cultural Affairs Department entrusted the Nichi-Ka Gakkai with 5,000 yuan to help students studying abroad. I formally wrote to the Cultural Affairs Department to inquire about this. Mr. Tsuboue Teiji, the director of the department, officially replied that there was no such thing. All documents can be provided as evidence. As for whether the funds lent by the Nichi-Ka Gakkai came secretly from the Cultural Affairs Department, or whether there was any relationship with the Cultural Affairs Department, the Hunan and Jiangxi provincial managers and the supervisor's office were completely unaware when they went to borrow the funds. It was not until the recent dispute that I inquired with the director of the Japanese Cultural Affairs Department and learned that the funds lent by the Nichi-Ka Gakkai were borrowed from local sources, fearing that they would not be repaid on time, causing the Nichi-Ka Gakkai to struggle to cope. Therefore, they designated 5,000 yuan as a guarantee for the Nichi-Ka Gakkai. However, neither the Cultural Affairs Department nor the Nichi-Ka Gakkai mentioned this situation to the Hunan and Jiangxi provincial managers or the supervisor's office at the time. After learning about this, I questioned Director Tsuboue why he did not say a word to the supervisor at the beginning. Mr. Tsuboue insisted that it was a matter between the Cultural Affairs Department and the Nichi-Ka Gakkai and that there was no need to inform the supervisor's office. I expressed my deep dissatisfaction with this. Fortunately, the 1,200 yuan borrowed by the Hunan manager from the society and the 800 yuan borrowed by the supervisor's office and then lent to the Guangdong manager have all been repaid. Only Deng Tianmin's case has not yet been repaid, but the manager should repay the full amount soon. This is a formal loan and cannot be considered as accepting Japanese subsidies.</p>
<p>Second, the issue of central government funding to assist students. In April and May of this year, gold prices soared, and the domestic political situation was unstable. Students from Hunan, Guangxi, and other provinces, whether government-funded or self-funded, felt financial hardship. I reported the situation to the minister, who forwarded it to the Executive Yuan, requesting the allocation of large sums of money to facilitate their return home. I also telegraphed the Ministry of Education directly with the same request. Later, according to the minister's reply from the Executive Yuan, it was decided to instruct the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds, but the Ministry of Finance never allocated a single penny. Even the decision to assist students returning home was not limited to government-funded or self-funded students. Only the Ministry of Education replied in a telegram, stating that it could allocate 10,000 yuan in national currency from the Chong fund as travel expenses for government-funded students from Hunan and Guangxi, which was slightly different from the original plan decided by the Executive Yuan. After receiving this telegram, the supervisor's office believed that unequal treatment of government-funded and self-funded students would easily cause disputes. Therefore, it presented the situation to the minister nearby for approval, temporarily not publishing the telegram, hoping to personally return to China to explain the difficulties to the Ministry of Education in detail. I received the telegram on June 28, and I returned to China on July 3. On July 10, I met Minister Jiang and explained in detail the reasons why both government-funded and self-funded students must receive the same assistance. Minister Jiang agreed in person. Later, I met Director Sun of the Higher Education Department. He initially believed that the Ministry's order was limited to government-funded students based on the telegram presented by the supervisor's office. After rereading the original telegram, he knew that the original telegram had mentioned both government-funded and self-funded students. Therefore, he had no objection to my personal presentation. I believed that both Minister Jiang and Director Sun were responsible personnel of the Ministry of Education. Since they had agreed in person, it should be implemented accordingly. After returning to Japan, I selectively lent funds to students in financial difficulty, whether government-funded or self-funded, returning home or not, from the funds approved by the Ministry of Education to provide assistance. This approach was partly my duty and I could not sit idly by, and partly because I had already obtained the personal approval of Minister Jiang and Director Sun. Unexpectedly, I recently received instructions from the Ministry of Education stating that some of the expenses borrowed by these students would not be approved, which was completely unexpected. If the expenses borrowed by the students are untrue, I will of course be severely punished. If they are true, then since they have been approved by the Minister and Director in person but are not approved, there seems to be a misunderstanding. I will submit another report.</p>
<p>Third, the issue of students receiving the Boxer Indemnity funds. Those who are unaware of the truth in the instructions from the Ministry of Education believe that there are more than ten people who are not eligible to receive the Boxer Indemnity funds. In fact, among the eighteen people deemed ineligible by the Ministry of Education, four are deemed by the Ministry of Education to be graduates of specialized schools who should not continue to receive the Boxer Indemnity funds after entering university. However, over the years, there have been many cases where graduates of specialized schools have continued to receive funding for university studies. One person was mistakenly reported by the previous supervisor, which I had already reported and corrected. The Ministry did not check the original case and mistakenly deemed it ineligible. It has now been verified and approved for funding. Another person was a student who had already received funding at the university last year. The Ministry of Education found that the original case approved that year was for research in a specialized subject, but they are still receiving funding at the university. This was also deemed to be my mistake. In fact, the supervisor's office did not expect there to be such a case in the old case from a year ago. In addition, there are twelve people who are continuing their studies or internships. At the end of June, I received an order from the Ministry to submit their grades for review. Although the Ministry of Education issued an order in mid-July to suspend the Boxer Indemnity funds, it was not appropriate to include those whose grades were still pending review under the previous order. As for the approval of the Boxer Indemnity funds for Han Jingyuan and Dai Liangmo, there were also some twists and turns. I admit that I have some shortcomings in the procedures, but in reality, there is no irregularity at all. I dare to say and believe that. After Mr. Wang finished speaking, he showed all the original letters sent to the Ministry of Education, the embassy, political party departments, and the Japanese Cultural Affairs Department, as well as letters from Director Tsuboue Teiji of the Japanese Cultural Affairs Department and the managers of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. It can be seen that student affairs in Japan are difficult to handle and cannot be described in words. It will also be difficult for those who become supervisors in the future.

<p>Jian De Refuses the Second Place Prize</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>We, the staff of the Champagne Cup Ping Pong Tournament of the Shanghai Race Club, humbly submit this letter. The primary aim of our organization in initiating the Champagne Cup tournament is to promote the sport of ping pong. Therefore, we have striven for perfection in all our measures. This year, we were honored by the enthusiastic participation of various teams, reaching a total of twenty-four. While some may attribute this to our organization's promotional efforts, we dare not take undue credit. The members of our organization have been diligently working to ensure the success of the event, especially given the increased number of participating teams. Fortunately, thanks to the understanding of the various teams, we were able to complete the event smoothly. We were greatly surprised by the sudden withdrawal of the Jian De team before the finals.</p>
<p>We have treated all teams equally, without any intention of discrimination. Therefore, we regret Jian De's unexpected action, both for the sake of their reputation and for the sake of the spirit of sportsmanship. We are compelled to record the details of the situation and submit them to your esteemed newspaper for publication, so that the public can understand the truth.</p>
<p>The number of seats for this final match was limited. To maintain order, all admission tickets were regulated. In addition to the ten complimentary tickets given to each team participating in the tournament, a certain number of tickets were also distributed to staff, referees, recorders, reporters, and so on. Therefore, the four hundred complimentary tickets prepared were quickly exhausted. The number of tickets for sale was also limited and equal to the number of complimentary tickets. Unexpectedly, the Jian De team requested as many as one hundred tickets. We immediately explained our predicament and were unable to grant them more than the ten tickets stipulated in the regulations. To our surprise, Lu Zhongqiu, a member of the Jian De team, tore up all the complimentary tickets, and the team captain, Lu Xiulu, did not prevent him. Such contempt for our organization and such a loss of personal integrity were rarely seen. However, we tried to handle it leniently, hoping that they would reflect on their actions. However, even after questioning, they did not realize their mistake and insisted that their team had cheerleaders, staff, advisors, etc. who required one hundred tickets. Such an unreasonable request is truly laughable, as we have never heard of cheerleaders, etc. needing to be given tickets.</p>
<p>In the interest of resolving the matter, our organization sent a letter to the team stating that during the competition, the players would be received on the field by our staff, and the torn tickets would not be investigated. However, the team did not understand and forgot their own actions. Until the day before the final (the 6th), they suddenly sent a letter requesting a postponement. As everything was already in place and the time was short, it was difficult to accommodate their request. Therefore, we immediately sent a reply and published a statement in the newspaper. As a result, the Jian De team was absent from the final match, and our organization's enthusiasm for promoting the sport was somewhat diminished, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Now that the past is over, let us speak for Jian De. Is it worth it to withdraw because the request for tickets was not granted and the request for a postponement was denied? Alas, although ping pong is a minor sport, it has its own inherent value that cannot be taken lightly. We cannot help but lament this setback.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted,</p>
<p>The Staff of the Champagne Cup Ping Pong Tournament of the Shanghai Race Club</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ping Pong Association Expresses Its Opinion</p>
<p>The Secretariat of the Shanghai Ping Pong Association issued an opinion regarding the Jian De team being ruled as having forfeited the match, stating that in yesterday's Champagne Cup final, Jian De and Tianma were evenly matched, and the outcome was difficult to predict. However, considering past performance and the talents of both sides, Jian De was actually superior to Tianma. Players of Jian De team such as Lu Xiulu, Lu Zhongqiu, Zhou Jianwen, Wang Bohong, Li Chuanshu, Guo Hai, etc. are all renowned Far Eastern players and rare talents in the ping pong world. Unexpectedly, news came that, due to a ticket dispute and correspondence with the Race Club, four days were spent without a resolution. It is said that when the Jian De team requested tickets from the association on Tuesday of last week, they had already stated that if the ticket issue was not resolved, the final on the 7th could not be held, and a postponement was requested. Unexpectedly, the association took a tough stance and used the championship as a constraint against the Jian De team. Because Jian De had won the championship in the previous competition by defeating Tianma six matches to one, Jian De believed that the club had lost the true spirit of promoting sports and wished to uphold the principle that athletes should not be driven by the concept of championships. Therefore, they decided to propose a postponement to the club so that the public could judge the matter. It is now reported that Jian De has been judged to have forfeited. The Tianma team has gained the championship without any effort, which is gratifying for Tianma, but also unfair to Jian De. Moreover, according to the competition rules, postponement of matches one day in advance was permitted by the club, as evidenced by the matches between Guangdong and Post A, and Japan and Jian De. Furthermore, the Jian De team had already informed the association on Tuesday that they would not compete if the issue was not resolved, and in their letter on Saturday, they informed the newspaper and the association of the reasons for requesting a postponement. Now, such an absurd and irrational judgment has been made. Is this not acting on impulse? Or is it favoring Guangdong and Japan while being unfair to Jian De? Or is there some other motive? It is regrettable that the public will not be able to see the skills of the Jian De team, and Tianma will not be able to display its power to avenge the defeat of six matches to one in the past. This championship seems to have been won in a shameful manner. If Tianma wishes to maintain its past glory, it should rise up and reject this type of appointed championship. If it does so, the reputation of the ping pong world will be greatly enhanced, adding luster to the sports world. It is heard that the Jian De team has decided to reject the second place prize offered by the club and is seeking public opinion.</p>

<p>The Sino-Russian negotiations resumed in Moscow on the 4th of this month. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a report from Representative Mo Dehui. Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper interviewed Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Jiazhen for details.

<p>Hankou...The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Not Yet Received a Reply from Japan</p>
<p>Suzhou and Hangzhou...The Japanese Government Is Willing to Return Them Voluntarily</p>
<p>Wang Jiazhen's Remarks to Reporters Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of recovering the Japanese concession in Hankou, the Japanese side has not yet made a formal statement after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a note. Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper interviewed Wang Jiazhen, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai, for details. According to Wang, he had not yet discussed the recovery of the Japanese concession in Hankou with Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu. It is said that the Japanese side's formal reply has been telegraphed to Shigemitsu, but the Ministry has not yet received it. In recent years, Japan has made many verbal commitments but few concrete actions regarding matters concerning China. This time, regarding the recovery of the concession, it is hoped that Japan can realize the importance of sincerely expressing Sino-Japanese friendship. Of the Japanese concessions in China, Tianjin and Hankou are the most important. The remaining concessions, such as those in Suzhou and Hangzhou, are of little significance. Shigemitsu had informally indicated to Wang that the Japanese government was willing to voluntarily return the concessions in Suzhou and Hangzhou. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently awaiting their voluntary relinquishment. The rumor that the Japanese concession in Hangzhou will be recovered on New Year's Day next year is not true. Wang returned to Beijing on the 11:00 PM night train last night.</p>

<p>Assumed Concurrent Post at the Shipyard Yesterday</p>
<p>Summoned Officials in the Morning for Instructions</p>
<p>Vice Director Chen Is Still Being Retained</p>
<p>Ma Deji, Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, and Chen Zaofan, Vice Director, submitted requests to the Ministry of the Navy last month, asking for approval to resign due to the heavy losses incurred by the sharp rise in gold prices in recent years, which hindered operations. The vacant position was temporarily filled by Chen Shaokuan, Vice Minister of Naval Affairs. After arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, Chen received the shipyard's documents and assumed his duties at the shipyard at 8:00 AM yesterday (the 8th). At 9:00 AM, he summoned all officials for instructions, stating that he did not bring anyone or any money with him, and that although the economic situation of the Jiangnan Shipyard was extremely difficult, the shipyard was closely related to the navy and indirectly related to the country. When the Premier was in Japan, he had a grand plan for the construction of the navy in his Outline of National Reconstruction. The original intention of the state to have the Jiangnan Shipyard was to make money and expand the economy. Unfortunately, in recent years, it has suffered heavy losses due to various reasons. He was very pleased to be able to meet with everyone at this difficult time, when foreign shipyards in Shanghai are competing fiercely. He hoped that everyone would continue to work diligently and carefully, and that any ideas for reform could be communicated to him in person or in writing, and he would adopt them as much as possible. He would not cause panic due to the change of leadership. In the future, if the shipbuilding industry gradually prospers and develops, and the Premier's construction plan is realized, it would be beneficial not only to the country but also to everyone. At 9:30 AM, Chen was greeted by the former Vice Director Chen Zaofan and the foreign staff of the shipyard. In the afternoon, he began work without any ceremony. Chen is scheduled to return to Beijing tonight (the 9th). It is heard that Vice Director Chen Zaofan is still being retained.</p>

<p>Meeting Today to Discuss Draft Letter</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association issued a notice yesterday, stating "Notice to all users of the Public Concession's tap water": Regarding the British Shanghai Waterworks Company's imposition of a 25% surcharge beginning September 1 of this year, the Association's representative meeting has resolved, based on the review of the company's account report, not to recognize the surcharge and has seriously negotiated with the Public Works Department. The Executive Committee has resolved to publish a notice to all users that all water prices should be paid at the old price (i.e., the price before August) before the negotiations are resolved. If water is cut off due to non-payment of the surcharge, please report it to the Association immediately. This notice is hereby issued on December 8, the 19th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Another notice was sent to all executive committee members yesterday, stating: "We are scheduled to hold the seventh meeting of the Executive Committee at 2:30 PM on December 9 (Tuesday) at the Association's building to discuss the draft letter to the Public Works Department regarding the non-recognition of the water company's surcharge, etc. Please attend the meeting at that time."</p>
<h3 id="e116">China Merchants Bureau Suggests Transferring Previous Equity <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Total Share Capital of 12.8 Million Taels</p>
<p>Takeover by the National Government with Funds Based on a Compromise</p>
<p>The Nichinichi Shimbun states that after the China Merchants Bureau was taken over and nationalized, special administrator Li Zhonggong was appointed to actively reorganize the bureau's internal and external affairs. However, the primary issue is how to transfer the equity of previous merchants to government control. Only after this issue is resolved can the remaining reorganization be carried out smoothly. The Design Committee of the China Merchants Bureau discussed this issue, stating that the China Merchants Bureau has a total share capital of 8.4 million taels, and the Jiyu Company has a total share capital of 4.4 million taels. The combined share capital of the two companies is 12.8 million taels. Each share originally cost 3 sets of silver, or 270 taels of silver. The current market value of each share is approximately 50 taels. If the government uses a compromise method of funding the takeover based on the original share value and the current market value, then a thorough reorganization after nationalization can be achieved in the near future, and expansion and construction can be carried out step by step. It is also speculated that most shareholders would be willing to have the National Government take over the equity using a compromise method, as the current market price of each share is only about 50 taels. It is difficult to determine whether the price can rise to 130 or 140 taels in a short period of time. The Design Committee has discussed this issue and made a sincere suggestion to the National Government, but it is not yet known whether the National Government will adopt it.</p>
<h3 id="e117">The Diplomatic Support Association for Chinese Citizens in the Netherlands Telegraphs the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Negotiate the Xiao Case <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Diplomatic Support Association for Chinese Citizens in the Netherlands held its first general meeting at the Chinese Overseas Association yesterday, electing the Chinese Overseas Association and 50 other groups as executive committee members, and the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and 20 other groups as supervisory committee members. After the election, the association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the name of the general meeting, requesting serious negotiations on the Xiao case. The text of the telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>"To the esteemed Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing: According to reports, the Dutch ambassador stated in his conversation that the Dutch embassy has received letters from various parties regarding the Xiao Xin'an defamation case, but has not received a protest from your ministry. The Dutch ambassador witnessed your ministry's submission and therefore concluded that 'the matter will be resolved by the parties involved and will not become an international issue.' These few words, contrasting the heat of 'various parties' with the coldness of 'your ministry,' are enough to describe the shortcomings of your ministry. Because it is said that 'various parties' indicate that it is public outrage. If it is 'public outrage,' then your ministry should protest. However, your ministry likes what the people hate and hates what the people like, not only violating the nature of the people but also making the world laugh. Does your ministry, which is far removed from the people, know the enthusiasm of the whole country against the Netherlands? Last month, the Shanghai Anti-Dutch Assembly was attended by more than 100 groups and thousands of representatives. The highest academic institution was the Academia Sinica. The leaders of the mass movement were the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee. The national public opinion center was the Shanghai press. The famous mass organization was the Ningbo Native Place Association. The venue was the 'stable' Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. The crowd had no 'irregularity.' Looking around, party and legal groups condemned the crime, not neglecting the distant. Magazines and newspapers attacked and satirized, not differing by factions. Literary scholars either cried in long songs or wrote tragedies. Workers and merchants either patrolled and boycotted or stopped work with generosity. Only your ministry was deaf and blind, indifferent and unconcerned. Are people all fools and your ministry alone wise? Are people all stupid and your ministry alone intelligent? If your ministry has no intention of flattering foreigners, the association deeply hopes that it will not be far before it restores its honor. Based on the resolutions of the Shanghai Anti-Dutch Assembly, the minimum requirements for the Xiao case are five: (1) The Dutch government must formally apologize to our government and guarantee that similar incidents will never happen again. (2) The Java Company must publish in Chinese and Western newspapers throughout China and all places where overseas Chinese reside, apologizing to our nation and Ms. Xiao, and guaranteeing that similar incidents will never happen again. (3) The first mate of the Chibad ship, Lan Anqi (H.W.L.vang), and the second mate, Lei Dima Kai (T.C. Rademakue), must be severely punished and not merely dismissed or demoted. (4) The shipowner, Yales (D.P. Als), and the ship's doctor, Bailing Gu (G.H. Bringow), must be permanently dismissed and not merely demoted or transferred. (5) Compensate Ms. Xiao for the loss of 100,000 taels. The Dutch side should be formally negotiated to relieve the doubts of all parties and clear the national shame. If they are attached to the Dutch court, despise public opinion, and sit on the opportunity to negotiate, further increasing the history of failure, our people, though weak, cannot forgive your ministry. Respectfully, the Diplomatic Support Association for Chinese Citizens in the Netherlands."</p>
<h3 id="e118">Supplementary Record of Mayor Zhang's Speech at the International Radio Station <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The International Wireless Radio Station in Zhenru held an opening ceremony on the 6th. Mayor Zhang was ordered by the National Government and the Executive Yuan to attend as a representative. His speech was recorded in the previous newspaper. Now we have found the original manuscript and are re-publishing it below:</p>
<p>"Today, the International Wireless Radio Station is holding its opening ceremony. Yesterday, I received a telegram from the Civilian Affairs Office of the National Government, stating that Minister Wang requested that a representative be sent to guide the ceremony, and the Chairman instructed to send Mayor Zhang. I also received a telegram from the Executive Yuan, instructing me to attend as a representative. I am honored to attend this grand ceremony. Our country's telegraph began in the eighth year of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, and has a history of more than 50 years. However, in the Qing Dynasty, we focused on wired telegraph and did not pay attention to wireless telegraph. Although in the early years of the Republic of China, wireless stations were established in Shanghai, Wusong, Chongming, Wuchang, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Beiping, and Zhangjiakou, domestic communication was still not smooth, let alone international communication. Therefore, our country relied on land lines and submarine cables for international telegrams. Land lines include the Sino-Russian line, such as from Hailanpao through Siberia to Moscow, or from Qiaaktu through Siberia to Moscow and then to various European countries. There is also the Sino-French line, such as from Yunnan through French Vietnam to various European countries, etc. All of these have lost their rights due to the impact of unequal treaties. Submarine cables include the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific companies, and Japan's Qingzu Yan, Da Hu Qi, and Kawashi Yamu to Tamsui four lines. The unequal treaties signed with our country, such as those concerning landing rights, transmission and reception rights, and apportionment fees, have severely infringed upon our country's telecommunications rights, which is well known to the people. The state's telecommunications are like the blood vessels of the human body. If it is held upside down and controlled by others, not only will rights flow out, but it will also be a hub for international political and economic aggression, which is extremely dangerous. In recent years, the people have paid attention to this. Therefore, the three northeastern provinces already have a large-scale international wireless telegraph station. Since the success of the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army and the establishment of the capital in Nanjing, it has been our responsibility to abolish unequal treaties. The contracts signed between telecommunications and international affairs are all naturally in the list of negotiating to abolish unequal treaties and revising equal treaties. On the one hand, we pay attention to establishing our own large-scale wireless station for international communication to maintain the independence of telecommunications and facilitate the transportation of telecommunications, so as not to be manipulated by foreigners. The Construction Committee established a large-scale wireless station in Shanghai the year before last, communicating with the United States via Little Luzon. Later, it was transferred to the Ministry of Communications. The Ministry of Communications also planned to establish a large wireless station in Shanghai to directly communicate with the United States, and after taking over, it immediately merged the plan, making the scale larger and the transmission faster. This is the current Zhenru International Wireless Radio Station. Since its preparation, it has been carefully managed, and all construction and layout are very complete. The excellent results of future international communication can be predicted. Today's opening ceremony is a celebration for the future of telecommunications. The efforts of Minister Wang and all those involved are evident. However, I also have something to add. Our country's telecommunications have been bound by unequal treaties for decades. After the pain, we have established this large-scale international wireless station. Not only will international communication be convenient from now on, but it will also promote the negotiation of abolishing unequal treaties, revising equal treaties, and recovering lost rights. I deeply hope that everyone will work hard, strive for perfection, and add a bright color to telecommunications and transportation. This is the long-term expectation that I, representing the National Government, representing Chairman Jiang, and representing the Executive Yuan, extend to you."</p>
<h3 id="e119">International Telecommunications Negotiations <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Director Zhuang's Speech at the Telecommunications School</p>
<p>Zhuang Zhihuan, Director of the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications, inspected the Telecommunications School at 3:00 PM yesterday. He was guided to various places by Principal Wang Yuxiang and Dean Yu Bingjian. Wang and Yu requested that he give a speech on the progress of international telecommunications negotiations so that his colleagues could understand the truth. He immediately agreed, and all teachers and students attended the speech. Director Zhuang briefly stated that there have been many misunderstandings among colleagues regarding the recent international telecommunications negotiations, and even blame has been placed on individuals, which is deeply regrettable. The construction of submarine cables was agreed to by our former Qing government. On the one hand, there are legal restrictions, and on the other hand, there are economic benefits. In the past, Qing diplomacy was handled by the Prime Minister's Office for Foreign Affairs, and the contracts signed were full of jokes and many shortcomings. Legally, national rights were damaged, and the so-called economic benefits were only a kind of sovereignty tax. It is painful to say this. The old contract will expire at the end of this year. The content focuses on debt relations, such as the Shanghai-Yantai-Fuzhou submarine cable loan and the prepaid overseas reporting fees, totaling 4.4 million yuan in Chinese silver. Initially, the other party believed that our country's domestic political situation was unstable and there was no sincerity in the negotiations. Then, they used our economic constraints as a means of coercion. Moreover, the contracts of the Great Eastern, Great Northern, Pacific, and Japan's four companies will all expire at the end of this year. These companies are using international encirclement as a means, and their interests are all aimed at mutual observation, containment, and hindrance to the progress of negotiations. The issue of the loan has now been resolved by Minister Wang in consultation with the Shanghai banking community, who have temporarily advanced 5 million yuan. As for the issue of international communication, the international wireless station, which has been prepared for a long time, was officially opened on the 6th, and the results were extremely satisfactory. In the future, the signing of new contracts, such as patent rights, landing rights, transmission and reception rights, and reporting fees, will be within the scope of not hindering our national sovereignty, in order to seek the most favorable path. Progress is being made actively. The outcome is unknown, and it is impossible to guarantee satisfaction, but the abolition of the old contract should not be a problem. I deeply hope that my colleagues will work hard in their studies and do their best to improve telecommunications. Once the negotiations are over, the details will be announced.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Internal Debt Creditor Group to Convene General Meeting Soon <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Office Has Been Found</p>
<p>Tianjin Representative Ding Wencha Has Arrived</p>
<p>The internal debt creditor group organized by the banking community of Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, since its establishment, has the important task of establishing an office to handle internal debt registration and hiring experts to study and sort out methods. It is heard that the group has borrowed a room from the Shanghai Banking Association Club to set up the office. The chief personnel that the group is looking for have also replied to Shanghai that they will come to Shanghai soon to discuss everything in person. Ding Wencha, the representative of the Tianjin Banking Association, has already reported to Shanghai. The group will convene a general meeting soon, but the date has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3 id="e121">An Overview of Internal and External Debt <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Internal Debt Group Has Not Yet Held a Meeting</p>
<p>The Hua Dong News Agency states that the Ministry of Finance of the National Government has preparations for reorganizing internal and external debt, and the domestic banking community is organizing a creditor group and has appointed Zhang Gongquan of the Bank of China and four others as representatives of the creditor group. However, although these representatives have been appointed, they have not yet begun to carry out their work. Tan Danya of the Continental Bank and Zhou Zuomin of the Jin City Bank are currently going to Wuhan and returning to Beijing, respectively. Therefore, a formal meeting of the representatives is difficult to decide at this moment. However, according to Lin Kanghou, Standing Committee Member of the Banking Association, the two representatives' trip to the north is to attend to personal matters and they will come to Shanghai soon. All preparations for the creditor group are currently underway. According to a gentleman from the banking community speaking to a reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency, it is difficult to calculate the exact amount of internal and external debt. However, the only reliable source is the report of the Beijing government's financial reorganization meeting before the 16th year of the Republic of China. As of the end of the 14th year, the debt under the Ministry of Finance was 486,646,630.38 yuan for external debt and 266,150,800.38 yuan for internal debt, totaling 752,796,800.76 yuan. The debt under the Ministry of Communications was 561,967,765.37 yuan for external debt and 87,358,621.93 yuan for internal debt, totaling 649,326,387.30 yuan. The above calculation of external debt was based on the standard of 1 pound of British gold equaling 12 yuan of national currency and 1 US dollar equaling 2.4 yuan of national currency at that time. The total amount above is more than 140,000 yuan, and with the addition of interest from the 15th to 19th years and the current exchange rate of gold, it is feared that it is more than 200,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The crafting of mahjong tiles and the gambling associated with them are prevalent in the islands [of Japan]. Most of the tiles used are produced in Shanghai, then shipped for export. Recently, several Chinese workers involved in mahjong tile manufacturing, including Shi Huacui, Ju Jinbo, and Wang Xingchang, traveled from Shanghai to Japan with the intention of establishing mahjong tile shops and manufacturing tiles for sale. When Shi and the others arrived in Kobe by ship, they were detained by the Japanese Water Police, who feared they would encroach upon Japanese industry and livelihoods. They were not allowed to land and were deported back to Shanghai on the same ship. They returned to Shanghai yesterday in a very distressed state.</p>
<p>Among the Chinese from various trades who went to Kobe were Lin Shengji and Lin Yao, who were engaged in the kimono business. Upon arrival, they were immediately denied landing and were forced to return to Shanghai on the same ship. Also, Yang Rongqing and Lin Qingyu, who were from Fujian and were traveling to Tokyo, were also prevented from landing. Furthermore, Wei Jintao, Pan Yingen, Zhou Rengen, Lin Qihao, and six other workers in the catering and labor industries, who were traveling to the Shitaya district, Asakusa, and Fukushima Prefecture in Japan, were also deported back to Shanghai yesterday on the Tsukuba Maru. These Chinese, after arriving in Shanghai, are now reportedly residing in the Hongkou and Nanshi districts.</p>

A total of sixty-three children qualified for the final competition. According to Zhuang Weizhong, the center’s health instructor, the children’s health levels were more uniform than in the previous competition, making it extremely difficult to judge their merits. Therefore, the judging panel decided to relax the quota and determine the final results during the final competition.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Baoshan County Plans to Dredge the Meipu River <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Meipu River in Meipu Township, Baoshan First District, has been severely silted up due to years of neglect.桂屢中, the township head, recognizing that transportation is quite inconvenient, submitted a request to the First District Office in mid-June to forward it to the Baoshan County Government for dredging to facilitate transportation. The County Government then instructed Sun, the former district chief of the First District, to work with Huang, the former director of the Construction Bureau, to make an overall estimate. However, District Chief Sun and Director Huang left their positions one after another, and the project was not realized. Now, District Chief Wang of the First District, together with Qian, Director of the Construction Bureau, have carefully planned and estimated that it will cost over 12,000 silver dollars. However, the district only has over 9,000 yuan of water conservancy funds, which is insufficient. Township Head Gui has been negotiating with farmers along the river to borrow the shortfall, and it is said that an agreement has been reached. Construction is expected to begin soon.</p>
<h3 id="e128">This Year's Wheat Production in the City is Relatively High <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Survey by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs previously formulated survey forms on the production status of large and small wheat, instructing each district committee in the city to diligently complete and report them. The statistics have now been compiled. The total production volume for the entire city this year is estimated to be over 350,000 dan. The varieties in each district are broadly divided into two types: awned and awnless, with red and white skin colors and good powder quality. However, the average yield is higher than in other regions. The reason for this is attributed to the suitability of the soil and climate, as well as the proximity to the city, which allows for a more adequate application of fertilizer. Therefore, the average yield per mu is over three shi for the highest and at least one and a half shi for the lowest.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Mishaps on the Upper Yangtze River Shipping Routes <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Xiushan Steamer Sinks: The water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, especially in central Hunan, is the shallowest. Above Chenglingji, it is only six to seven feet deep. The Jardine Matheson Company's Hunan liners have changed to using shallow-draft vessels like the Xiushan. Last week, the Xiushan set off from Hankou carrying cargo and passengers. When it reached Chenglingji, the ship ran aground. The shipowner issued a distress signal. The Hankou branch of Jardine Matheson immediately dispatched a tug to rescue it. However, the water level receded daily, and the Xiushan, due to carrying a lot of cargo, ran aground very deeply. The riverbed is full of reefs. Multiple small vessels tried to tow it for days without success. Yesterday, news reached Shanghai that the bottom of the Xiushan had been breached, and river water was entering the hold. The ship was sinking. The passengers on board have already been transferred to small boats to Changsha. It is not yet known if there were any injuries. However, only a small portion of the cargo has been unloaded, and the rest has sunk with the ship, resulting in a huge loss. The Xiushan is one of the four new shallow-draft vessels of Jardine Matheson's Upper Yangtze fleet. The ship's hull is very good and can carry over 180 tons of cargo.</p>
<p>The Jintang Steamer Escapes Danger: The company's Chongqing shallow-draft vessel, the Jintang, replaced the 1,000-ton Wantong to sail to Yichang and Chongqing, carrying a large amount of cotton yarn and piece goods. When the ship reached Shishou, it encountered bandit boats. To avoid the bandits' guns and artillery, the shipowner deliberately ran aground on the Shishou River, making it impossible to sail. Fearing that the bandits would board the ship to rob and kidnap the crew and passengers, the shipowner, to protect the lives of everyone on board and avoid being kidnapped, ordered the sailors to throw 130 pieces of cotton yarn and some piece goods, worth over 60,000 yuan, into the Yangtze River to reduce the weight. After the goods were discarded, the Jintang was able to move. The bandits were about to board the ship on small boats to rob when a warship arrived, saving the Jintang from danger. It was heard yesterday that the ship has been towed out and is heading to Chongqing, but the loss of goods is estimated to be about 70,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Xinyunnan Steamer is Robbed: Yesterday, a British ship arrived in Shanghai from Yichang. The crew members told reporters that the Xinyunnan, which was transporting special tax goods, was robbed by bandits at Tiaoguan. The ship also ran aground to avoid the bandits' gunfire. There were over a hundred bandits who boarded the ship and looted not only the cargo but even the ship's accessories, such as anchors and chains, leaving nothing behind. The twelve soldiers escorting the ship and the crew members were all kidnapped by the bandits and are still missing. The rivers in Sichuan are full of bandits, making it extremely difficult to navigate.</p>

<p>Chinese businessmen Bao Dating and others raised 500,000 yuan to establish Kaili Company to open new shipping routes from Shanghai to Xiangshan, passing through Ninghai, Huanglong, Sizhou, Shengshan, Jushan, Daishan, and Shenjiamen Gaoting. They have purchased a Japanese ship, rebuilt it into a passenger ship, and named it Kaiyuan. It is expected to start operating within three weeks. For now, there will be only one class of cabins. The fare from Shanghai to Huanglong, Sizhou, and Shengshan is 3 yuan per person. The fare to Jushan and Daishan is 2 yuan, and the remaining stops are 1.5 yuan. The freight rate for cargo and water is 5 to 8 yuan per ton. During the incense season, it will also travel to Shantuan. In the future, another ship will be added as the business develops.</p>

<p>Rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession are protesting against the increase in rent by the rickshaw owners to 0.13 yuan per day, as it is an excessive burden. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., 51 rickshaw puller representatives, including Liu Fuqing and Meng Jinchen, held a second meeting to discuss opposing the rent increase at Zhengan Lane, Gonghe Road, Zhabei. Xia Renqi, a representative from the district party department, also attended to provide guidance. Liu Buqing was elected chairman, and Liu Ruian was the recorder. The chairman reported on the suffering of the rickshaw pullers and the rent increase by the rickshaw owners in the Public Concession. Meng Jinchen then reported that the rickshaw owners are planning to open a rickshaw puller training school to numb the rickshaw pullers and prevent them from opposing the rent increase. They discussed how to respond and decided to publish a statement denying the training school, advising the rickshaw pullers not to be deceived by the rickshaw owners, and adding six preparatory committee members for each road. He Zhengcheng, Zhao Yisheng, Shen Weimin, Ge Zhengui, Yuan Zhejiang, and Xu Fukang were elected to participate. Finally, it was decided to actively carry out the opposition to the rent increase and hand over all accounts to Liu Leshan, the director of the preparatory committee, for compilation and settlement. The meeting adjourned at around 6 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Gonghe Steamer's Comprador Drives Workers Ashore <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs Cables the Hankou Bureau of Social Affairs for Mediation</p>
<p>The Jardine Matheson Company's Gonghe steamer, which operates on the Yangtze River, has replaced its comprador. Shen Huating has resigned, leading to a dispute with the 40 existing workers on the ship. The details have been reported in this newspaper. At that time, Director Pan of the Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs sent staff member Wang Bin to mediate. He warned Shen not to dismiss the workers without cause and publicly instructed all the workers to remain on the ship and continue working as usual, pending a resolution of the matter. However, the next day (the 5th) in the evening, as the ship was about to set sail for Hankou, Comprador Shen suddenly ordered a certain Gu to gather over a hundred armed thugs and tightly guard the Zhuang Yuanda Shuntai pier, as if facing a major enemy. He forcibly drove all 40 workers ashore. The workers were unable to resist and disembarked. The next day (the 6th), they all petitioned the Bureau of Social Affairs. Director Pan was furious upon hearing this and immediately telegraphed the Hankou Bureau of Social Affairs, asking them to mediate nearby to avoid conflict. The original text is copied below: "To Director Yang of the Hankou Bureau of Social Affairs: Shen Huating, the new comprador of the Jardine Matheson Company's Gonghe steamer, disregarded mediation and relied on the concession as a shield. On the evening of [blank], he gathered armed thugs to force over forty workers ashore and set sail. Shanghai workers have telegraphed representatives in Hankou to negotiate, fearing conflict. Please mediate nearby, otherwise, there will be direct action after the ship returns to Shanghai. [Signed] Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs [Official Seal]"</p>

<p>Shanghai's Third and Fourth Ferry Boats</p>
<p>Speed of 12 Nautical Miles Per Hour</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities took over the Pukou Ferry (i.e., from the Bund on Nanjing Road to Donggou), it has been determined to make improvements and to facilitate transportation without the goal of profit. Last year, the newly built Ferry Boats No. 1 and 2 were put into service, with beautiful, comfortable, and sturdy equipment. Their high speed made travel very convenient for passengers. Recently, Ferry Boats No. 3 and 4 were added to expand the routes and operate to Gaoqiao. They were built by the He Xing Factory and have now been completed. The supervisors and technicians from the Bureau of Public Utilities conducted trial runs in the Tangwan area, and the highest speed reached 12 nautical miles per hour. The fastest ships on the Huangpu River in the past were those of the Da Lai Company and the Dredging Bureau, but none could reach 12 nautical miles per hour. The municipal ferries are the first to set this record. These ferries usually only need 10 nautical miles per hour, but in the lower reaches of the Huangpu River, when the wind and waves are high, they can operate at full power without being affected and without any delays. It is said that the Bureau has scheduled an official trial run on December 15th and has invited representatives from relevant organizations to visit the ship.</p>
<h3 id="e135">The Songhu Railway Branch Station is Scheduled to Relocate to the East End of Baoshan Road <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Track Change on the Night of the 12th</p>
<p>Traffic Stopped for Six Hours</p>
<p>The Songhu Railway crosses Zhabei Baoshan Road with a gate. Since the introduction of steam trains this year, there are more than 70 round trips per day. The gate is frequently opened and closed, which not only obstructs traffic but also affects municipal development. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and the Bureau of Public Works, in view of this, suggested relocating the Songhu branch station to the east end of Baoshan Road. The proposal was submitted by the Municipal Government to the Ministry of Railways for instructions. It is learned that the railway authorities have received the Ministry of Railways' approval for the relocation and have scheduled the track change and laying work to begin from 12 midnight on the 12th to 6 a.m. on the 13th of this month. During this six-hour period, vehicles traveling to and from the Baoshan Road gate must stop. The Bureau of Public Utilities has sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau to inform the relevant district police stations to pay attention.</p>

<p>Chinese and Foreign Authorities to Discuss Solutions</p>
<p>The "Da Mei Evening News" reports that the Public Concession police dispatched special car teams to patrol the roads built beyond the concession today (the 8th). Regarding the issue of police authority on these roads, the opinion of Chief Inspector Quirke is that the Shanghai Municipal Government is also very willing to cooperate with the concession to permanently resolve the disputes. The Municipal Council has already mentioned this matter to Mayor Zhang, but the date for sending personnel to discuss the matter has not yet been set. It is expected that the date will not be too far off. Currently, both the police and the Municipal Council hope to reach a complete understanding with the Chinese authorities and agree on effective solutions. At present, the Public Security Bureau has set up two police stations next to the Municipal Council's roads, and its police officers patrol the Municipal Council's roads from time to time, but there have been no reports of interference with foreigners.</p>

<p>Japanese Ships of Nisshin Company frequently assault passengers. Last time, a servant in the Xiangyang Maru beat a passenger from Anqing to Wuhu to death because he didn’t have a ticket. The Wuhu Local Court already sentenced the assailant to six months imprisonment. The Comprador of the Xiangyang Maru already spent over 2,000 yuan to try to settle with the family, but a settlement has not been reached and compensations have not been paid. Before that case could be settled, another incident happened: the chef of the Dali Maru assaulted a vendor. The ship already arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is claimed that a vendor, Chen Wenfa, boarded the ship in Datong and went into the kitchen to warm himself by the fire. Chef Yu Azhang and others saw him and drove him away. But because he didn’t leave, Yu and others beat and hung him for a whole night. The vendor suffered grave injuries. When the ship arrived in Wuhu, the passengers, unhappy, turned Yu Azhang and two other suspects over to the Public Security Bureau to be sent to the court. The court immediately decided that the injured would be treated in the hospital and the head of the kitchen, Fan, would be responsible for the four yuan medical fee per day until the vendor was discharged from the hospital. The three suspects would be imprisoned in the courthouse and released when the vendor’s injuries were healed. The Ship’s Management will take responsibility for all costs. The ship left as scheduled this morning.</p>

<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Works, in view of the fact that there are many ordinary houses in the city that have been converted into temporary factories, and that public safety equipment is often lacking, making them unable to withstand unexpected dangers, invited representatives from the Public Security Bureau and the Bureau of Social Affairs to a meeting on the 18th of last month to discuss the matter. It was decided at the meeting to send personnel to conduct investigations and stipulate three rectification measures: (1) All rear doors must be kept open at all times during working hours and must not be locked. Factories without rear doors must add them within a time limit. (2) The factory staircases must be sturdy, and each house must have at least two staircases. If several houses are connected to form a single factory, the number of staircases should be increased according to the situation. If it is necessary to add fire escapes due to the large number of people, they should be ordered to be added. (3) If it is possible to install fire hydrants, they should be ordered to install them. Otherwise, they should be ordered to equip a certain number of fire buckets. It is said that these measures are only temporary solutions. Currently, personnel are being sent to start inspections in the jurisdiction of the four districts of Zhabei, while other thorough rectification measures are being drafted. Once they are finalized, the city's factories will be divided into areas for sequential investigation. The factories that have already been inspected are as follows: Changji Oil Cake Factory in Panjiawan, Xiangfeng Flower Shop on Guangfu Road, Changxing Dali Military Uniform Factory on Baoshan Road, Dahua Military Uniform Factory on Zhongxing Road, Dachang Military Uniform Factory on Xinmin Road, Huafeng Military Uniform Factory on Jinling Road, Rongchangxiang Military Uniform Factory in Wanan Lane, Baotong Road, and Fuchang Military Uniform Factory in Sanyang Lane, Sanyang Road.</p>

<p>It has been found that foreigners have always collected Chinese medicinal materials, and as such, imported from inland, up to 50 million yuan. It is shocking in number. However, our country does not have specialized medicinal material exporter, therefore, allows benefits outside and is deploring. It was recently heard that Du Wenchuan and Lin Daoyong initiated fundraising for 100,000 yuan by gathering medicinal merchants and prominent figures to establish the Zhifa National Medicine Export Trading Company at 183 Henan Road. It specializes in exporting medicinal materials to develop foreign trade. It has already been established and is applying to the government for registration, tax exemption, and patent promotion. This may not be a ray of dawn for foreign trade.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Fifth District Public Security Bureau Cracks Down on Reactionary Organization <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Multiple Bandits Arrested</p>
<p>Reactionary Publications Seized</p>
<p>Yu Bolu, the district director of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei Baoshan Road, received a report from detective Chen Keqing at approximately 1:00 PM the day before yesterday. The report stated that the Renji Printing Company at No. 9 Linban Road, within the jurisdiction of the Third Section of the Fifth District, was printing communist reactionary publications. He requested that police be dispatched for investigation. Director Yu immediately ordered patrol officers Gu Wentao, Niu Kaiping, Jia Wenbin, and others to lead armed police officers and detectives to the scene. Working together with Zhou, a patrol officer from the Third Section of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, they discovered various reactionary publications, including the Red Flag Daily, as well as lead plates, within the Renji Printing Company. Wang Zhenghan and others who submitted the manuscripts were taken to the bureau for questioning. Subsequently, a member of the same gang, Zhang Yunfu, went to deliver plates but was noticed by the police, who apprehended him. Zhang attempted to bribe the officers, but they refused. Two communist badges were found on his person, and he was sent to the bureau along with the others. After investigation and interrogation by Director Yu, it was learned that accomplices were hiding at No. 149 Taihua Lane, North Jiangxi Road. He immediately ordered the same group of officers to go to the address, along with detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Police. Yu Lin and Yang Xi were arrested and temporarily held in police custody. They were extradited to the Public Security Bureau yesterday afternoon. Including the suspects, a total of thirteen people were arrested. All have been handed over to the Judicial Section for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Lawsuit Involving Residents and Landlord in Jiyi Lane <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Point of Contention</p>
<p>Is the Validity of the Lease</p>
<p>The Judge Adjourns for Pronouncement of Judgement</p>
<p>Hoping That Both Parties Reconcile</p>
<p>During the summer, Ye Shantao, the owner of the Yizun Company, instructed its manager, the British firm Tonghe Yanghang, to notify the residents of Jiyi Lane on Shanxi Road to move out in order to rebuild. The residents formed an association to negotiate with the owner regarding rent increases and lease extensions. However, the owner later regretted the agreement and sold the property to the Hexing Company for 1.1 million yuan, causing the tenants to receive repeated eviction notices from both the old and new landlords, treating the lease as waste paper. The residents, numbering seventeen households, jointly hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a lawsuit with the Special District Court, requesting a judgment to confirm that the lease agreement with Yizun Company and Ye Shantao was valid and binding on Hexing Company. Yizun also hired lawyer Lu Zhongliang, who, in addition to denying the establishment of the lease agreement, filed a counterclaim to recover over 8,000 taels of rent owed by the tenants. Hexing Company also hired lawyers Cai and Li to file a counterclaim against the tenants, demanding they move out. Judge Xu Wenrong held a hearing. As reported previously, testimony was heard yesterday morning. Xinmin Hotel, a tenant, stated that the lease contract was prepared by Tonghe Yanghang and distributed to each tenant with the door number and name filled in. The tenants signed and stamped the contracts. Tonghe never came to pick up the contracts from Xinmin. Inside Jiyi Lane, according to the agreed-upon rent increase level, houses inside the lane were to have a 30% increase. The defendant initially wanted to increase the rent for Xinmin by 50%, similar to the increase for houses facing the street. After several discussions, the defendant insisted on a 35% increase, so Xinmin did not immediately stamp the contract. This does not mean that they disagreed with all the terms. Lu Shaotang was then questioned about the negotiation process with the landlord. Lu stated that he was sent by the tenant association as a representative to assist the landlord to negotiate. He went to Tonghe Yanghang to seek the owner's opinion. According to them, the owner insisted that street-facing houses be increased by 50% and houses inside the lane by 30%. If a house collapsed within five years, the owner would not be responsible. Furthermore, the tenants were not allowed to sublet during these five years. If all tenants agreed, the demolition would be delayed for five years. Some three or four tenants did not fully agree with the terms, but Tonghe insisted that all tenants agree, or they would not sign the lease. Because of the disagreement among the tenants, he resigned from mediation, and Zhang Xingzhai continued to negotiate with the landlord, he said. The owner of Mohuaxuan, a tenant, stated that the rent collector, Mr. Ying, instructed them to ask Lu to negotiate with the landlord because Ying said Lu was closest to Ye Shantao. Lu's resignation was due to Tonghe's statement to the tenant association on September 19th, announcing the cancellation of the agreed-upon lease. Because they felt that they could not face the tenants if they suddenly canceled the agreement, he resigned. Zhang Xingzhai then described his negotiation with the landlord after Lu's resignation. The tenants saw the landlord's letter canceling the previous agreement, in which he did not agree to extend the lease for five years. They then reduced the request to one year, during which time there would be no demolition or rent increase. Unexpectedly, two collapses occurred in houses inside the lane, and the landlord was even more unwilling to delay the demolition even for a moment. Several tenants who heard Zhang mention the collapse of the houses immediately clarified that what collapsed was a shed built by the tenants themselves, and only one rubber sheet was damaged, not the main beams or rafters. The arguments then began. Lawyer Chen Tingrui, representing the plaintiff, spoke for the longest time, stating that the first defendant, Yizun Company's, counterclaim for rent arrears was unreasonable. The plaintiffs were not refusing to pay rent and were willing to pay according to the new rent increase. The money was stored in the bank because they did not come to collect it. Therefore, their counterclaim should not stand. The second defendant, Hexing Company's, counterclaim for eviction should be a preliminary hearing. Moreover, the purpose of their counterclaim was different from the main suit, so there was no need to argue it. The reasons for the plaintiff's request for confirmation of the lease agreement and the binding of the second defendant to the contract were sufficient. The contract had been established, and some tenants had already paid rent at the new rate, so it had already taken effect. Tonghe's letter on September 19th also acknowledged the existence of this contract and requested its cancellation. The ink was not yet dry, and the words were still in the air, so how could they go back on their word? The reasons for their request for cancellation were not related to the plaintiff. Although it seemed reasonable to say that they could overturn the contract because they had not signed it, a review of the nature of the contract showed that there was no room for cancellation. Since the contract was prepared by Tonghe, it was no different from Tonghe making an offer to the tenants. According to the law, if the offeree did not express refusal of the offer, the offeror should be bound by the offer. In this case, the plaintiffs had not only not refused but had also obeyed the order to stamp the contract, so the defendant could not be exempt. Therefore, he specifically requested that the court confirm the validity of the lease and order the second defendant to be bound by it, he said. Lawyer representing Yizun replied that the disputed contract had not been signed by the defendant and was still in the hands of the plaintiff, so it had not been established and could be revoked. As for the offer, the plaintiff had offered the defendant a five-year no-rent-increase and five-year no-demolition, while Tonghe had proposed no subletting. The tenants had different opinions on this, which was tantamount to expressing refusal, and the defendant could also cancel the previous agreement. Furthermore, two collapses had occurred, indicating that the house was old. In short, since the plaintiff could not produce a contract signed by both parties, he should request the dismissal of his claim. The defendant's counterclaim for rent arrears. The deposit slips presented by the plaintiffs in this hearing were incomplete, and some had no name or the amount was insufficient to cover the arrears. It was clear that the plaintiffs wanted to use the lawsuit to delay the payment of rent. If they secretly moved away after owing so much, the defendant would suffer greatly. He requested an immediate judgment and a declaration of provisional execution, he said. Lawyer for Hexing Company argued that Hexing's counterclaim was related to the main suit. The plaintiff's argument regarding the level of jurisdiction was wrong and should be rejected. Hexing was being considerate of those who had to move and was extending the deadline by one month to the end of February next year. Xu, the judge, adjourned the debate, scheduled the pronouncement of judgment for the 16th, and advised both parties to reconcile outside of court during this period.</p>

<p>A Diversion Tactic in Action</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at about 6:00 AM, the Watson Motors company located in the Bofford apartment complex of Broadway Road received a call from a guest at the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road, requesting to rent a car. The accounting department instructed driver Lu Shuishan to drive car Shanghai Municipal #4579, Concession #17644 to the location. Once he arrived at the entrance of the Far East Hotel, he saw two men standing and waiting. Seeing the car pull up, they immediately stopped it and told the driver that the guest upstairs had been waiting for a long time and to go upstairs quickly to get the luggage. The driver believed them and went upstairs to notify the guest. However, after inquiring everywhere, he could not find him. He went downstairs to ask about it, but the car was gone, and the two men were nowhere to be found. In a panic, he ran to the police station to report the incident. At around 9:00 AM, a patrolling officer from the Daxi Road police substation in the Second Section of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau in Xujiahui saw a police officer pushing a car on Daxi Road near Columbia Road. He saw that the car number was white plate 17644. He immediately returned to the station to report it. Chief Liu instructed a patrol officer to investigate. Because the incident occurred in the concession, the car was handed over to the police station to be taken away.</p>

<p>Fan Shengcai Files a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Zheng Liangzhen, who is over thirty years old, works at the Baoshan Paper Mill in Bajiaqiao, east of the Yokohama Bridge in Zhabei. He is a friend of Fan Shengcai, who lives at No. 34 Yida Lane, Huade Road. Zheng married a woman named Hu in his hometown of Nantong in the past, but because the cost of living in Shanghai was too high, and his monthly income was not enough, he did not bring his family to live with him in Shanghai. Zheng saw that Fan's younger sister, Deyi, was beautiful and only twenty-two years old and could not help but salivate. Therefore, his interactions with them became increasingly close, as the drunkard's intention was not in the wine. This summer, Zheng falsely claimed that his wife had died of illness and asked a matchmaker to propose marriage to the Fan family. At that time, they were deceived and believed it to be true. On the eleventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, they formally became engaged. Unexpectedly, after the engagement, rumors spread that Zheng's wife was alive and had not died. After the Fan family learned of this, the whole family was surprised and spent months finding out that Zheng's wife, Hu, was indeed in his hometown. On September 14, he went to Nantong with Zheng's wife, Hu, to see her husband. Zheng was speechless and ashamed. The Fan family believed that it was illegal for a married man to dare to get engaged to another person and immediately demanded the termination of the engagement. However, Zheng outwardly agreed but secretly delayed. Recently, he became angry and spread rumors that Fan had incited many gangsters with guns to harass him at the Tilanqiao and extort money from him. Fan Shengcai could not bear it any longer and hired lawyer Tian Heming to file a criminal lawsuit in the local court yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Startling News: An Eleven-Year-Old Child Acts as a Kidnapper <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Actually Kidnaps Two Children</p>
<p>Both are Arrested with the Adult Kidnapper</p>
<p>The day before yesterday evening, a man carrying three boys hired two rickshaws at the Chunjiang Wharf in Pudong. The man sat alone in one car in front, and the three children sat together in the other car behind, heading south. When they passed the Yingkang Timber Company on the Three Wan Factory, they were seen by Liu Dezhong, the patrol chief of the Third District. Seeing that the man looked anxious, he immediately stepped forward to question him. The man claimed that the three children were his relatives. Chief Liu asked him what kind of relatives they were. Unexpectedly, the man was unable to answer after this interrogation. He then asked the patrol chief not to make it difficult for him and that he was willing to offer 30 yuan as a reward. Chief Liu knew that this was not right and detained all four people, large and small, and took them to the Third District Public Security Bureau. After interrogation by the district chief, the man confessed that his name was Liu Maolang, 24 years old, from Chongming. He lived in a hemp rope shop in Xuejiabang, Nanshi, and that two of the three children were actually kidnapped, while the other was an accomplice. The district chief thought, how could a child of about ten years old act as a kidnapper? Upon further questioning, Liu confessed that the young kidnapper's name was Zhao Gengsheng, only eleven years old. His brother, Zhao Xiuzhai, had the initial idea to open a room in the Southern Hotel on Ermalu Road to recruit me to design. He ordered me to wait at Guanqiao in Nanshi at 9:00 PM, and Xiuzhai would take Gengsheng to the entrance of No. 16 Xiaojiu Hua, Xiaonanmen. Gengsheng would go up and lure out the two children (the ones who were kidnapped), and Xiuzhai would take them to Guanqiao and call me to lead them back to the hotel. He had agreed with Lin Zhongyu from Minhou, Fujian, to sell the two children to Lin for 40 yuan each, a total of 80 yuan. I was paid when the people arrived. Today, Xiuzhai ordered me and his younger brother to take the two children by boat from the Xinguang Wharf to Pudong, then take rickshaws back to the old Baidu and hand them over to Lin for export to Fujian to avoid the eyes and ears of others. Unexpectedly, the case was suddenly solved, etc. According to Zhao Gengsheng, he was eleven years old, from Taizhou, and lived at No. 111, Xiaocaitang, Sanjiaojie, Nanshi. Because my brother Xiuzhai saw that the two children who were kidnapped were handsome, he intended to order me to lure them to the entrance of the two children's residence, and the two children were indeed fooled and followed me, etc. After questioning, the two kidnapped children confessed that one named Jin Gen was eight years old, from Pudong, and his father's name was Jisheng, a coppersmith. The other was Wang Xiaogou, eight years old, from Nanjing, and his father's name was Wenyi, a foreman. They lived together at No. 16 Xiaojiu Hua, Xiaonanmen. They were playing at the entrance last Saturday, and he (referring to Zhao Gengsheng) suddenly came up to us and said that there was a living monkey performance nearby and told us to go and watch it quickly, etc. We believed it to be true and followed him. After turning several corners, an adult came and then met another adult (referring to Liu Maolang), who forcibly pulled us into a rickshaw and took us to a hotel to live in. We had no relatives and cried loudly. Today, these people brought us here again, and we don't know why, etc. After obtaining the confession, the district chief sent detective Zhang Yong to arrest Zhao Xiuzhai and Lin Zhongyu, who planned to sell the two children, both had fled. He also went to the homes of the two children to inquire.</p>

<p>At that time, the parents of the two children were crying. Zhang immediately told them about the solution of the case, and they were overjoyed and smiled through their tears. They then followed the detective to the Third District. After questioning by the district chief, Liu and others not only separated people and flesh but also enticed them to kidnap them for export. After that, it was difficult for the two children to return to their hometowns. This kind of behavior was even more harmful than kidnapping and was contrary to human nature. Zhao Gengsheng was so young and dared to commit this illegal act. Therefore, a document was prepared and sent to the general bureau yesterday to request that the two criminals, large and small, be sent for strict handling.</p>

<p>The Zhang Nai bigamy case, which caused a sensation, has been resolved, and it is said that Zhang Nai subsidized You's loss of 5,000 yuan and stipulated monthly living expenses. Yesterday, Ms. You said that she was respecting the wishes of the mediator and her father in resolving the case. After all, the swaddling baby was Zhang's flesh and blood, so how could Zhang not be responsible for raising him? She was weak and sick, and she had to personally breastfeed the child, so she could not go out to make a living. Even if she did not reconcile and waited for the police to file a public prosecution, You did not know how long it would be delayed. Moreover, the former mediator once said that this was a family matter and did not need outsiders to participate, so reconciliation was the right thing to do. Zhang Nai had made two previous attempts to reconcile without success. She was sincerely afraid that the reconciliation would change, so the lawsuit had not been withdrawn. After the reconciliation, Zhang's brother, Yu Baoyuan, came to her to inquire about cohabitation and rental arrangements. She meant that Zhang Nai must come here himself to discuss the arrangements and meet the nursling. Zhang had not yet seen her. Yu Baoyuan said that Zhang was currently suffering from typhoid fever in a hospital in Zhabei but did not clearly state the exact address. If he was sincere in reconciling, why was he avoiding her? When the mediator came to reconcile, she asked how to deal with Yang in the future. The answer was that this was another question that was not related to the scope of the reconciliation and should not be mentioned. After the news of the reconciliation spread, there was criticism from the outside world that she was prioritizing money. They did not know her suffering. If that were not the case, the newborn infant would be entirely borne by her. Could his father not care about anything? The small amount of living expenses was also insufficient, and even the monthly milk powder item was quite expensive, not to mention other items. How could she maintain it? But Zhang Nai had not yet fulfilled the conditions, and she did not know if he was sincere. Her relatives in her hometown heard of this and came to Shanghai to mediate. After her father fell ill and returned home, Zhang Nai did not come to visit. She planned to wait for her younger brother (at Jiaotong University) to return to her hometown for the New Year's holiday before making any decisions.</p>

<p>Totaling Three Thousand Seven Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>In recent years, the business of the Commercial Press factory on Baoshan Road in Zhabei has been thriving. A second factory was specially set up across from the Guangdong Merchants Hospital on Tiantong An Road. All employees' wages were sent there monthly by a staff member. The day before yesterday at 3:00 PM, a staff member was carrying paper money totaling 3,700 yuan in a private car to distribute it at the factory. When he reached the corner of Zhongxing Road and Baotong Road, four robbers suddenly appeared, each holding a handgun, blocking the way. Two robbers held their guns to the staff member's chest, ordering him to hand over the money. The two robbers searched and robbed all the 3,700 yuan in paper money and fled. The staff member reported the incident to the Fifth District Police Station, requesting an investigation. The district chief inquired in detail about the robbery and the robbers' faces and clothing. The car driver claimed that he seemed to recognize the robbers or that they were laid-off workers. The district chief felt that the car driver seemed suspicious and ordered him to be detained for investigation. The car driver is currently being held at the Fifth District Police Station.</p>

<p>Cheng Deyu Kicks Open the Door</p>
<p>Shameless Man and Woman Both Captured</p>
<p>Cheng Deyu, a 34-year-old native of Jiangdu, currently resides at No. 93 Daxing Back Street in the South City and works in the silk industry. He married a Miss Xu from his hometown many years ago. However, Miss Xu developed a promiscuous nature and was restless at home. Recently, she engaged in secret affairs with Jin Zhongyang, a fortune-teller from Yuyao residing nearby at No. 116 Chezhan Road. Although Cheng had heard rumors for some time, he tolerated it repeatedly due to concerns about his reputation. However, Miss Xu remained unsatisfied and, a few days ago, used the excuse to urge Cheng to take their young son back to Yangzhou first. Cheng, unable to endure any longer, secretly hid the child at a relative's house and pretended to return home. In reality, Cheng remained to investigate. Unexpectedly, Jin went to Cheng's house that very night to secretly meet with Miss Xu. Cheng then kicked open the door and caught them both naked. He immediately called for the patrol officer from No. 29 Jiangyin Street, who arrested them and took them to the Second District Police Headquarters. Chief Wang of the district initially interrogated Miss Xu, who confessed that she was 36 years old. She claimed that Jin Zhongyang owed her money, and she had repeatedly demanded repayment. Last night, he asked her to spend one night with him in exchange for clearing the debt. She said that because her husband had already returned home, she agreed to his request. When questioned, Jin Zhongyang, admitting to being 55 years old, directly confessed to having illicit relations with Miss Xu. Chief Wang, based on the confession, considered the case to involve adultery and immediately prepared documents to transfer the case to the court for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e165">French Merchant Van Lenna Fraudulently Obtains Huge Sums <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>French Consulate Sentences to Five Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that French merchant Van Lenna repeatedly created false invoices and bad checks to fraudulently obtain huge sums of money from major banks in Shanghai through the practice of document against acceptance. He successively defrauded them of a total of 15,000 pounds. The French Consulate has now sentenced him to five years imprisonment and a fine of 3,000 francs, but suspended the sentence. His accomplice, Arnault, was sentenced to six months imprisonment and a fine of 1,000 francs, also with a suspended sentence of five years. The defendant was charged with fifteen counts in total. Three of these counts involved repeatedly defrauding the Bank of India and the Banque Franco-Chinoise of a total of 7,730 pounds of money obtained against bills amounting to 5,065 pounds. The other twelve counts involved inciting and assisting his employee, Arnault, to repeatedly defraud the Banque Franco-Chinoise, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China, of 25,000 pounds of money obtained against bills amounting to 10,000 pounds. After the court hearing, the representative of the Banque Franco-Chinoise stated that between March and April of this year, the defendant repeatedly used invoices, bills of lading, and bills of exchange for shipments of European raw silk to obtain advances from the bank. By July, the defendant's company had gone bankrupt, and the drafts he issued were rejected by the drawees. Investigations revealed that the weight and packing dimensions of the European raw silk were completely inconsistent with the invoices and bills of lading. As a result, the plaintiff bank could only sell one-quarter of the advanced money. Subsequently, the liquidator of the defendant's company, accountant B. Weill, testified that 1.6 million francs were missing from the accounts and had been remitted to the defendant's brothers in Lyon, with almost no assets remaining in Shanghai. Later, representatives from the Bank of India, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and the Mercantile Bank of India successively described their experiences of being defrauded, which were largely similar. Finally, the defendant confessed to the fraud. He claimed that he initially created false invoices to obtain advances to cover debts of 100,000 francs owed in France in May of last year, and this gradually became a habit that he could no longer remedy, stating that he did not intend to defraud. The judge considered that this behavior damaged commercial ethics and undermined the foundation of credit instruments, and should be severely punished. He sentenced the defendant as described above, but suspended the sentence. The accomplice, Arnault, was also charged with twelve counts, but had previously fled Shanghai and failed to appear in court. He was tried in absentia and also had his sentence suspended.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Counterfeiting Discount Coupons for a Soy Sauce Store <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Defrauding Away a Lot of Soybean Oil, Several Brothers Arrested Together</p>
<p>The newly opened Dingfeng Soy Sauce Store at the intersection of Zhoujiazui Road and Zhoushan Road in the Zhabei district, to attract customers, held a discount event and printed a type of special coupon, each coupon worth one yuan. Holding this coupon to purchase oil could obtain cheaper goods. The store clerk, Lu Bosheng from Suzhou, related this matter to his younger brother, Fusheng, thinking that they could take the opportunity to counterfeit the coupons to sell as imitations, thereby greatly profiting. They decided on the plan and carried it out. At first, they were not detected, and they grew bolder, issuing more and more counterfeit coupons. On the day before yesterday, from morning to noon, the soy sauce store successively received over twenty counterfeit coupons, causing them great suspicion. In the late afternoon, Wang Rensheng from Changshu, carrying two oil boxes on his shoulders, brought eleven coupons to exchange for soybean oil. Examining the coupons, the store owner, Li Qinzhou, found that none of them were genuine, so he detained Wang and reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Wang for questioning. Wang then confessed that the coupons were made by Lu Bosheng, an employee of Dingfeng, and his younger brother, Fusheng. They then arrested Lu. Since Fusheng lived in the territory of the Second Precinct of the First District in the Chinese area, they coordinated with detectives and rushed to Fusheng's home to search it. They confiscated counterfeit coupons, stamps, and several boxes of soybean oil obtained through fraud and took them back to the police station. Fusheng was temporarily detained at the police station, awaiting a formal request from the Special District Local Court to transfer him for interrogation. The morning before yesterday, Lu Bosheng was escorted to the Special Court, where Judge Feng interrogated him and ordered him to be detained, awaiting a letter to the Municipal Security Bureau to transfer Lu Fusheng to be interrogated together.</p>

<p>To the Editors of the *Shen Bao*:</p>
<p>With regards, in your newspaper yesterday, in the "Local News" section, a report was published that detectives rescued two female meat ticket kidnap victims from Wuxi in the western suburbs of Minhang, which does not correspond with the facts. The victims in question were recovered in the Punam [Pu Southern] area which is in the territory of Fengxian County, and the nearby Desheng Port also belongs to Songjiang, and is not in Minhang Town in our district. The Police force is well-manned and there have been no kidnapping cases or meat tickets discovered in the territory of our district, so you see the winter defences are in an active state. We have deep concerns that this news will confuse the audience. We respectfully write this letter to request that you investigate and correct it as appropriate.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>— Long</p>
<p>Don't simply envy other people's wives for being fashionable and beautiful. They are likely anxious that they can't satisfy their loved one's desire for money.</p>
<p>Giving up a seat to a female passenger on the tram is indeed a virtue. However, from the perspective of new people, men may be underestimating women as weaklings.</p>
<p>A person who can still cry is not yet completely heartbroken. A truly heartbroken person will never let others know.</p>
<p>The joy obtained in favorable circumstances is not true joy. The joy obtained in adverse circumstances is true joy.</p>
<p>Beautiful women need money just as flowers and plants need rainwater; both are indispensable. Therefore, beautiful women and famous flowers can be said to be the exclusive property of the wealthy, and poor scholars cannot inquire.</p>
<p>The ancients said that it is best to drink wine until half-intoxicated, and flowers are most beautiful when they are half-bloomed. Everything in life should be viewed in this way to be interesting.</p>
<p>A man who truly understands equality and liberalism will never blame a woman for falling in love with someone else. Because a woman is not a toy, she has her freedom. If she doesn't love you and goes to love someone else, can you force her to love you and not love someone else?</p>
<p>Money obtained through schemes is difficult to accumulate. Money obtained through hard work is easy to keep.</p>
<p>It is not difficult for us to find a lover, but it is difficult to find a confidant.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Old Man Su Kan's Talk on Health Preservation <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Gongyu</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng Sukan is seventy-one years old this year, but his body is strong and his spirit is vigorous. He looks like someone in their fifties. He has not suffered from illness for decades. When he traveled to Japan, he walked across steep mountains and climbed dangerous rocks with the agility of a young man, which was admired by people in that country. I once suspected that he had a secret recipe for health preservation, so I asked him. Mr. Zheng smiled and said, "There is no other way to preserve health than to eat less, sleep less, and work more." I sleep at 9:00 PM every night and get up at 3:00 AM, so I call myself "Night Riser." After getting up, I exercise for about five minutes, drink a little tea, and write from 4:00 AM to 6:00 AM. I eat congee for breakfast, half a bread roll for lunch, and congee for dinner. Other than that, I don't eat anything else. I work all day without feeling hungry or tired. I have been doing this for more than twenty years. I never eat any tonics. I don't like comfort in ordinary times. I have never been afraid to go out even on cold, snowy days. Sometimes, because I get up too early, the servants are not awake, so I get water, wash my face, and brew tea myself without feeling tired, and my body becomes stronger every day because of it. When night comes at the hours of Zi and Chou [11:00 PM - 3:00 AM], the subtle Yang energy begins to move, which is the time when heaven and earth generate life. People's thoughts are clearest at this time (this is Mencius's theory of night energy). If one can escape the dark slumber at this time, one's physical strength and spirit will naturally be full, and evil Qi will not easily invade. This is why I get up at night. People only know to eat more to nourish the body and indulge in leisure to nourish strength, but they don't know that nourishing the body doesn't entirely depend on food, and exercise is even more sufficient to ward off illness. This is why I eat sparingly and like to work." These famous words are enough to exhaust the ancient and modern methods of health preservation. Mr. Zheng's calligraphy is famous all over the world, and he never stops learning calligraphy every day, becoming more and more skilled as he gets older. Recently, he has also liked to write Qin seal script and cursive script, with his brush strokes surpassing his predecessors. However, Mr. Zheng himself says that he needs more time to be admired. He is so humble. Mr. Zheng commented that my seal script is the most energetic and flawless, and he also kindly wrote a preface to my clumsy engraved seal collection, praising it excessively, which makes me feel ashamed. Mr. Zheng especially praised my elder brother Mengrong's paintings as being both heavenly and man-made, praising them incessantly. His sincere encouragement of later generations is beyond what others can achieve.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Mei Lanfang's Talk on Stabbing the Tiger <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Mang</p>
<p>In America, the first successful play, the American newspapers comment on this play</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang's previous visit to the United States was extremely successful and was recorded in the annals. The greatest power of artistic success was the play *Stabbing the Tiger*. This play tells the story of the late Ming Dynasty when Li Zicheng was approaching the capital. A princess, fearing pursuit by the bandits, had a palace maid, Zhen'e, pretend to be the princess and hide in a dry well. Later, she was found by Li Zicheng's subordinates and presented to Zicheng. Zicheng married her to General Li Guo. Li was brave and good at fighting, and everyone praised him as a "tiger." On the night of the wedding, Zhen'e took advantage of his drunkenness and killed him. Zhen'e's original intention was to assassinate Zicheng, but even though she accidentally hit the wrong target, she still regretted her wasted talent. In a fit of anger, she also committed suicide. The entire play is called *Iron Crown Picture*, and *Stabbing the Tiger* is the most exciting part of it. Mei performed this play in the United States, and it moved cities. The audience was as crowded as a wall, and there were still countless people who could not get tickets after it had been performed for a month. Its value can be known. The structure of this play is excellent, and its meaning is very profound. Furthermore, Mei's performance is delicate and moving, without any carelessness. The great praise comes with good reason. Yesterday, a friend sent me a collection of Mei's reviews in American newspapers, and I have translated a few sections about *Stabbing the Tiger* below:</p>
<p>The *New York Evening Post* said that Mei's performance of *Stabbing the Tiger* said, "Stabbing the Tiger is a drama with profound meaning because it is about revenge and sacrifice."</p>
<p>The *New York Morning Post* said, "Stabbing the Tiger is about a palace maid's revenge. The meaning of this play is similar to the modern plays *Judith of Bethulia* and *The Road to Rome*, which are quite imitative of it."</p>
<p>The *New York Telegraph* said, "This play, *Stabbing the Tiger*, makes it easier for us to understand and feel endless interest in it compared to other plays. The palace maid played by Mei Jun is very much like Lady Macbeth in Shakespeare's play Macbeth."</p>
<p>American drama critic Yang Shide said, "Chinese opera is like reality everywhere, but at the same time, it is far from reality. It is a manifestation of daily life everywhere, but what is expressed is not daily life, which is very surprising to us. Chinese opera is a very profound program that expresses the entire art."</p>
<p>He also said, "The thing that impressed me most about Chinese opera is the play *Stabbing the Tiger*."</p>
<p>The *New York Daily News* said, "Mei Jun is a person who combines 'dance,' 'acting,' and 'singing.' I have never seen hand gestures performed so beautifully on stage."</p>
<p>The *New York Times* said, "Mei Jun's performance is extremely pure, like a pool of clear water in the forest."</p>
<p>It also said, "Mei Jun's posture is solemn and beautiful, which cannot be described in words."</p>
<p>Yang Shide said, "Mei Jun's movements and expressions, whether it is the rest of Repose or the shocking Shock, are the essence of the most perfect and pure art.

<h3 id="e181">Factory Visit to the Buliduoli [Supplement Power Lots] Manufacturing Plant <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Lie</p>
<p>Since the spread of modern medical theories in our country, the need for new medicines has been increasing day by day, and the price of medicines flowing into foreign countries every year is astonishing. Recently, the voice of promoting domestic products can be heard everywhere, but due to the limitations of economy and talent, the majority of new medicines have not been able to be manufactured domestically. The Jiufu Company created various exquisite and perfect medicines that can replace imported goods. This year, two new drugs, pure Buliduoli and Hanjiguai Buliduoli [Supplement Power Lots], are aimed at imported goods that economically invade foreign countries, so since their release, they have won the sympathy of all sectors of society. The company succeeded in producing these drugs only after much research, and previously invited the medical and pharmaceutical communities to openly visit the factory, which was highly praised and considered to be the only great pharmaceutical factory in our country. On the day before yesterday (December 6), they invited the press and people from all walks of life to visit the factory. I drove to the company's factory site on Baker Road at around 3:00 PM and saw that the visitors were already extremely crowded. I immediately signed my name and entered, and was led into the Buliduoli manufacturing workshop by a company employee. Various manufacturing machines were running, making non-stop grinding noises. Each machine was arranged in a large manufacturing room. Starting with extracting the essence of cod liver oil, various medicines and procedures were successively added. The process was transmitted from machine A to machine B, and then from machine B to machine C, passing through more than twenty times until Buliduoli was manufactured. The entire process did not use manual labor and relied entirely on the latest scientific methods and new-style machines. It can also be seen that the progress of our country's pharmaceutical industry is very different from what it was a few years ago. All kinds of machines were labeled with their names, including a total of more than ten kinds of machines, such as a fully automatic mixer, a lifting machine, a centrifugal separation clarifying machine, a vacuum distillation machine, a cooling machine, a suction machine, a washing machine, a finishing machine, a filter press, an emulsifying machine, a combining machine, and a mixing machine. After visiting the Buliduoli manufacturing workshop, we turned to the second room and saw the machines for manufacturing Bailingji [hundred spirits base] tonic pills and for manufacturing Shengdan [birth pill] pills were all working. It was heard that working eight hours a day could produce 1,200 bottles of pure Buliduoli, 1,200 bottles of Hanjiguai Buliduoli, 500,000 pieces of Bailingji, and 2 million Shengdan pills. On that day, about 3,000 people from all walks of life came to visit. Fortunately, they came and went continuously, so it did not feel too crowded. There were also sixty or seventy people from the press. At around 5:00 PM, the company prepared Muscat tea and refreshments in the tea room on the second floor for a brief chat with the press. During the conversation, I heard people talk about how, since the drug stores refused to sell foreign goods, the demand for the company's Buliduoli had increased even more. Also, at the turn of autumn and winter, there were many patients with coughs and lung diseases, so the sales of Hanjiguai Buliduoli were especially smooth. It was heard that foreign merchants were very alarmed by this situation and planned to contact our country's drug merchants with huge sums of money, hoping to continue selling foreign goods. However, we take patriotism as the premise and should not be tempted by meager money. After the tea and refreshments were finished, I returned and recorded it.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>I was happy to ask for directions, but I was struggling to find someone to translate Hindi. From five o'clock until eight o'clock, I began to sit again, and I repeated various styles of worship in the four directions, muttering with my head prostrating to the fire. His whole body was covered in ash. How strange. I asked someone to translate and asked him, and he replied that there were books. When I asked again, he did not answer directly, but spoke in various languages and told me to come closer. He put a few pieces of fruit pulp in my hand and gave me a lotus flower that was about to bloom. Then he ordered me to take a pinch of ash from the fire with my hand and follow him. He also ordered me to put the ash on my face and smear it on. I realized that he was going to use magic to make me believe in his religion. I told him directly that I was unwilling. He still had words, so I said goodbye. The ash-throwing heretics can practice austerities, not wear clothes, and worship fire as their teacher. The Kasyapa brothers, disciples of the Buddha, had a total of 1,250 disciples, all of whom were heretics who worshipped fire. The reason why they were conquered by the Buddha was that people in ancient times had to keep the fire burning day and night because it was difficult to continue the fire if it was extinguished, so they thought it was a god of light and guarded it. This eventually became a kind of belief. Evolved people changed it to lighting lamps and candles. This school is not progressive and still adheres to ancient methods, evolving into religion. The Book of Changes says that Li is fire. India has earth, water, fire, and wind. Various heretics explain the origin of all things, and the early philosophers of Greece also used water, fire, wind, etc. to explain it. The basis of heretics who worship fire is not without reason, but they can practice austerities. But it is also not economical. They eat one catty of milk a day, which is very expensive. Their consumption of firewood must be at least two yuan. Their daily life must cost at least three yuan. Then, what is the point of this asceticism? The income of a worker is not enough to pay for it. No wonder their bodies are very fat and plump. In short, it is not appropriate to eat without plowing. In today's enlightened world of economics, all gods and ghosts should reduce their powers to engage in work. Tolstoy often said that he laughed at the missionaries of the religious family, saying that the head can work and should be able to eat. He placed the priests in the upstairs for several days without giving them food, so they cried loudly and fell down, saying that this was Xu Xing and Geng Ying's group mocking the Confucians.</p>

<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Pilgrimage to Italy Diary</p>
<p>(3) Ten Days in Rome (11)</p>
<p>Day Three — Trajan's Column — San Pietro in Vincoli Basilica —</p>
<p>Anyone who travels to Italy and sets foot in the streets of Rome will always feel the different flavors of the remains of the Roman era and the Renaissance. After seeing many bathhouses, triumphal arches, monuments, or large buildings of temples and palaces, and further entering the halls and rooms to observe the sculptures and paintings, one can especially recognize the differences in their primary mission and artistic elements. The Roman era was busy developing national power, and its characteristic was the military-state strategy of emphasizing practicality and real benefits. Therefore, the artworks of that time only had "necessity" and "utility," lacking pure artistic creative desire, thus becoming true realism. This is why the architecture and sculpture of that time were mostly assembly halls, large bathhouses, circular theaters, triumphal arches, memorial columns, bridges, and aqueducts, the remains of which are still found throughout Rome. Although the Renaissance, which began in the fourteenth century, claimed to trace classical art, its spiritual essence still lay in the evolution of Christian culture over thousands of years. In terms of architecture, from underground tombs to Basilica, to Romanesque, to Gothic, to Byzantium, it has been developed all the way to the Renaissance style. Renaissance architecture spread from Italy to Europe at that time. They also destroyed the relics of ancient times and took those stone materials and sculptures to decorate tombs and churches — for example, the marble columns of the Roman St. Peter's Basilica came from the tomb of Hadrianus, and the bronze doors of the Lateran Basilica were moved from the Baths of Caracalla — Rome's largest building, St. Peter's Basilica, the world's largest cathedral, was also completed during this period.</p>
<p>Slowly bypass Trajan's Column Square and the Colosseum, and suddenly ascend a few dozen stone steps to a plateau. The majestic and extraordinary structure of the San Pietro in Vincoli temple stands in front of the square. This is the main relic of the Basilica style built in the fourth century, which is different from the style of Renaissance architecture. Since Emperor Constantine designated Christianity as the state religion, Christians walked out of the underground Catacombs and built Basilica churches on the ground. Later, Basilica architecture was directly inherited by Romanesque architecture. On the other hand, it moved to Byzantium due to the eastward migration of Emperor Constantine the Great, and evolved into Byzantine art.</p>
<p>San Pietro in Vincoli temple is a rectangular building with gorgeous mosaic floors inside. In 1506, Pope Julius II commissioned Michelangelo to build his tomb here. Originally, Michelangelo planned to create dozens of statues like Moses, using the majestic ideal possessed by the power and solemnity of the Sistine Chapel ceiling. Unfortunately, not long after the work began, it was terminated due to the slander of the architect Bramante, which is a huge loss to humanity that Romain Rolland lamented in distress.</p>
<p>The Moses statue is now on the right side of the altar. When we look at it, we feel that the statue is filled with irrepressible anger, with bulging muscles on the face, expressing a sublime and great spirit, simply possessing the might of the Alps.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Financial Gold Prices Open Unprecedented Record <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The rising trend is out of the ordinary</p>
<p>It is also difficult to get new positions</p>
<p>New High of 624 Taels and 3 Mace. Yesterday, gold prices repeatedly saw a strong rising trend, charging straight and unstoppable, once exceeding the usual and reaching a high of more than 622 taels. It was due to the repeated declines in overseas silver markets that caused turbulent waves, rising and falling rapidly, with twists and turns of two or three taels, which is not surprising. The total market rose by six taels. Looking back, the industry's intentions were hesitant and difficult to handle, and the demands for supply were different. For example, Yifeng, Yongyuanheng, and Dalian Gang all had purchases, while Xieyu, Fuchang, Yuanmaoyong, etc., were all selling short positions, but the quantities were not large. As early as the morning, it was heard that it had already reached its peak, jumping sharply by seven or eight taels. Later, the exchange rate was even tighter, and the listing price was reduced by another level. As a result, the market atmosphere was extremely sharp, and it suddenly rushed out to 624 taels, setting a new record that had never been seen before, even exceeding the peak in June of this year. Afterwards, rapid winds and torrential rains rose and fell uncertainly, hovering between 624 taels and 21 taels. The future market is still chaotic. At first, it was 21 or 22 taels, and then sellers excitedly broke through the 620-tael mark. It once retreated to 18 taels. Almost all new long positions were reluctant to be made, because the bottom price was too high, fearing a reaction. It is said that the morning market may fall again.</p>
<p>Spot market chaos rises to 25 taels. The opening price for the spot gold in January morning was 622 taels and 8 mace, an increase of 7 taels and 4 mace (the spot market was chaotic, initially 23 taels to 5 taels, but there were few transactions, and then it was around 21 taels, and then it rose to 23 taels). As for the major silver bars, yesterday's telegram fell by one-quarter, the forward price fell by three-sixteenths, the silver price fell by three-eighths, and the transactions of various firms varied. Suddenly, sellers seemed to be more, falling to 21 taels, 3 or 4 mace. Suddenly, the buying momentum increased, and Yifeng, Yongtong, Taichang, etc., took action and went in, immediately rising to 24 taels and 1 mace. Afterwards, Cuitai and other outsiders sold, reducing one tael or so. The exchange rate was very firm. The three-month British gold rate was initially 6 pence ○625, and later 6 pence, which was absorbed by HSBC. When the first order was announced, it was 22 taels, 6 or 7 mace, and the listing price was reduced by 25 US dollars and 50 cents, and the Japanese gold rate increased by 2 cents. However, the gold price did not rise but fell, because Xieyu sold a large batch, and Huayi and Dongya hedged the three-month British gold rate at 160625. Dalian Mitsui bought only 1 tael, 3 mace and 6 fen, and then sold it. The one- and two-month British gold rate was 160625. Banks could do business in and out, so the rate fell from 10:00 to 20 taels ○02 mace. Afterwards, the exchange rate improved, and Maihang and Sumitomo sold to British for January 16, and Zhongfu and Feng mutually hedged 160625. Zhifengyong, Yuanchengyong, Dadesheng, Tongtaichang, etc., all bought in the market, so the price gradually rose until 11:15, reaching a high of 24 taels and 2 mace. The three-month US dollar rate of 160625 was bought, and Mitsubishi appeared in Dalian, calculated as 1 tael, 3 mace, 6 fen and 5 li, but Zhifengyong sold it again, and Xieyu sold it again, only falling by more than 2 taels in just over ten minutes. At 11:30, it was 21 taels and 6 mace. Yuantai articles, etc., chased in. At 11:45, it was 24 taels and 1 mace again. Then, due to the continuous sellers, it fell sharply by 3 taels to 20 taels ○08 mace. The market closed at noon at 21 taels and 8 mace. The announced price was changed to 663 taels and 4 mace. The Japanese gold rate was increased by 2 cents, initially pressing 41 taels inside and outside, and later 39 taels, and then around 42 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The evening closing result rose again by 4 taels and 9 mace. The after-market opened at 22 taels and 8 mace (spot market 22 taels, 3 or 4 mace to 7 or 8 mace). Then it was 2 taels and 9 mace. The Indian exchange report was small, but Jiu'an was not moved by it. Afterwards, the trend tended to soften. Yongfeng, Juchang, Fuchang, etc., sold a lot, but it hovered at a few cents from time to time. After 2:45, it had fallen to 20 taels and 8 mace. The three-month British gold rate was absorbed by Mitsui, etc., at 16125, and North Korea sold the January rate of Dalian at 1 tael, 3 mace, 5 fen, and 875, so people's hearts were frustrated. After a short time, it rose again by 1 tael, 7 or 8 mace. Zhifengyong, etc., bought in. At 3:00, it was 22 taels and 6 mace, but the exchange rate loosened, and Yuda, Yongfeng, and retail investors tended to sell. Moreover, the one-month British gold rate could be settled at 16025. In a short time, there were turbulent waves, and it suddenly broke the 20-tael mark. At about 4:00, it was 18 taels and 3 mace. In an instant, articles, etc., came in, and Datong absorbed the one-month US dollar rate at 36 yuan and 6875, so it jumped up 4 taels, but it was wandering and elusive, making it difficult to handle. At 4:10, it was 22 taels and 4 mace. In an instant, Fuxingyong, Yuancheng, etc., came to sell, and it plummeted by 2 taels to 20 taels and 1 mace. At 4:30, the market closed at 20 taels and 5 mace, an increase of 4 taels and 9 mace compared to last Saturday (a cumulative increase of more than 21 taels in the past three or four days). It was done again to 21 taels, so the articles were raised by 5 mace. The highest price of the day was 24 taels and 3 mace, and the lowest price was 18 taels and 3 mace, a difference of 6 taels. The articles opened at 23 taels in the morning, closed at 22 taels at noon, and closed at 2 taels and 6 mace in the afternoon. The announced price was reduced by more than 40 taels, and later it was 44 or 45 taels. The result was 43 taels on the account, 25 taels, 22 taels, and a water supplement of 25 taels, and 24 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The intention of the peers is hesitant and difficult to handle. The transactions of the peers vary. It is estimated that Yifengyong, Yuanheng, Tongtaichang, Shunli, Wanxing, Yuanchengyong, and Bingxing all entered. Taikangrun and Yongfeng, Dadesheng, Zhifengyong have no fixed intake and outflow. Fuchang, Xieyu, Yuanmaoyong, Shengda, and Hengxing all entered. The articles came out and then entered. In the afternoon, Fuchang, Yongfeng, Yuda, Xuchang, Taikangrun, Yuancheng, etc., all came out. Dadesheng, Zhifengyong, and Fuxingyong have no constant intake and outflow. Shunli has few outflows and many people enter. Wanxing then exits. Yuanmaoyong and Yuanchengyong articles all enter. Dalian Gang entered a total of 3,200 or 300 pieces and exited 2,200 or 300 pieces. Guang Gang exited hundreds of pieces.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Foreign Exchange Exceeds Qualification, Tightly Delicate <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listing prices for each exchange rate were reduced by one level, because the overseas silver market fell again the day before. The British gold rate was reduced by 25, calculated as one shilling, five pence, and eight seventy-five. The US dollar rate was reduced by half a yuan, calculated as 36 yuan and 125. The Indian exchange rate was reduced by one and a half yuan, calculated as one hundred rupees, 0025. The French franc was reduced by thirteen yuan, calculated as nine hundred and twenty yuan. The German exchange rate was reduced by 2 yuan and 25 cents, calculated as one hundred and fifty-one marks and five. The ocean currency was reduced by 1 yuan and 25 cents, calculated as eighty-nine shields and seventy-five. The Po exchange rate was increased by 2 taels and 25 cents, calculated as one hundred and fifty-five taels and a half. The Hong Kong exchange rate was not changed, calculated as eighty taels and 075. The Japanese gold rate was increased by 2 cents, calculated as 1 tael, 3 mace, 7 fen, and 375. The trend of the internal market in the bank is also tight, but there are occasional hidden opportunities. It is because the gold market is turbulent, and an unprecedented new peak has been discovered, exceeding the 622 taels and 2 mace in June, reaching 624 taels and some change. The rising trend is charging straight and unstoppable, with a swing of 6 taels throughout the day. As a result, the rates have been increased cumulatively by about 5 taels. It is estimated that each increase in the closing price compared to last Saturday is 0.625 for the British gold rate, 0.125 for the US dollar rate, and 1.375 for the Japanese gold rate. Chinese merchants have thrown out. Banks have absorbed some, such as Mitsui, Dongya, and HSBC. There is still some activity in interbank hedging. It is estimated that the British gold rate has been traded for a total of more than 200,000 pieces, and the US dollar rate has been settled for more than 20,000 yuan, and more than 100,000 yuan has been sold. Dongya and Mackary have sold out, and Datong has entered. The Japanese gold rate has been hedged by the Dalian Gang for 200 to 300 million yuan. North Korea, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Huabi, etc., have sold out. The Dalian market has risen more, so purchases are made in Shanghai and sold in Dalian, which can make a profit. It is estimated that the market in this port is also improving.</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Silver and Money Market is Still Considered Safe and Sound <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, the momentum of the silver and money industry is becoming weaker, and there is almost no market worth recording. Although there are various market prices every day, the transactions are sparse and the competition is weak. It is expected that there will be no major changes. However, the auxiliary coin market price seemed to stabilize yesterday and slightly decline, and it is difficult to predict how it will rise and fall in the future. However, according to mutual rumors among people in the industry, if there is assistance from outside ports, it may be possible to continue to decline, otherwise, it may have to be raised again.</p>
<p>The discount rate still declines after rising (Foreign Discount) There are few transactions in the morning market, and people's hearts are weak. As a result, the discount rate falls by 3 hao and 7 hu and a half to 7 mace, 2 fen, and 5 li. The noon market drops by 1 hao and 2 hu and a half to 7 mace, 2 fen, 4 li, 8 hao, and 7 hu and a half. The statistics still fall by half a li, and the situation is still in the process of stabilizing. (Silver Discount) The morning market is 1 mace and 5 fen, which is 3 fen better than the previous day. The noon market then falls by 4 fen to 1 mace and 1 fen. The bank's listing price is 6 fen, with a water addition of 3 or 4 fen.</p>
<p>The prices of single and double hao are similar The Jiangjiao and Guangjiao markets are proceeding side by side in the morning and noon. The morning market is 6 mace, 6 fen, and 4 li, and the noon market is 6 mace, 6 fen, and 3 li. The situation is slightly more stable than the rising trend of the previous day. The transactions made Jiangjiao 5,000 jiao in the morning market and 3,500 jiao in the noon market. Guangjiao 65,000 jiao in the morning market and 20,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins returned to a length of 2,000 wen for 367,000 wen, with transactions of more than 30,000 strings. It is reported that the market atmosphere is still considered safe and sound, not as crazy as in the past.</p>
<p>The receipt and delivery of silver dollars seems to be slightly more complicated (Silver Funds) Yesterday, the bank's receipt and delivery seemed to be slightly more complicated because it was the beginning of the week. Chinese merchants received and delivered 2.5 to 2.6 million yuan, and foreign merchants received and delivered 3.1 million yuan. The settlement of funds received and delivered 4.6 to 4.7 million yuan, special funds received and delivered more than 2 million yuan, and various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous funds received and delivered 1.0 million yuan. Mortgage funds were settled at 70 to 800,000 yuan, 1 million yuan was released from the warehouse, and 800,000 yuan entered the warehouse. Japanese banks received and delivered various funds of 570 to 80,000 yuan, settled more than 100,000 yuan, and released 600,000 yuan from the warehouse. Qianzhuang and Yinging companies received and delivered 43 million yuan individually, and the watermark funds received and delivered more than 5.3 million yuan. Various exchange funds received and delivered more than 1.6 million yuan, and received cash of several hundred thousand yuan. (Foreign Funds) Exchange funds were made out at 835,000 in the morning market and 1.12 million in the noon market. There were no transactions in the morning market of banknotes. 15,000 banknotes in the morning market and 75,000 bank checks. Banknotes were made out at 160,000 in the morning market and 115,000 in the noon market. Banks bought and sold 400,000 in the morning market and 650,000 in the inter-market in the noon market. Various bank foreign accounts received and delivered more than 2.2 million yuan, and banknotes entered and exited more than 200,000 yuan. Qianzhuang Yanggong companies received and delivered 6.3 million yuan individually, and the watermark funds received and delivered more than 2.1 million yuan. Short-term foreign funds entered and exited more than 1.2 million yuan, and small Qianzhuang transactions were more than 500,000 yuan. Customer sources and destinations were omitted because there was no formal need and the market was not important.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Securities and Bond Market are Leisurely, with Mutual Rises and Falls <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for public bonds was extremely clear. 7,000 yuan was offered for the 19-volume and 19-customs demobilization, and there were no other transactions. The futures market was also deserted, and large market participants were waiting and watching, and the sentiment was very cold. It is estimated that more than 4.1 million was traded in the morning, and 60 to 700,000 each for demobilization, disarmament, 96, Zheng 6, and 19 customs, and other items were even more scarce. It is because each industry is about to carry out the lunar calendar settlement, and the deadline is approaching, so they have to engage in the ending. As for the rise and fall of bond prices, because the supply and demand are balanced, it is even more stable than the end of last week. The rise and fall in the front and back markets is extremely slight. In the first market in the morning, almost nothing moved. Later, the sellers slightly took the advantage, so they turned slightly lower. As a result, there were mutual rises and falls, and the numbers were all around 3 or 4 corners. The situation in the bond market is unlikely to have major rises and falls for a while.</p>

<p>The Market Plate Shows An Urgent Downward Trend</p>
<p>The Yarn Market Has A Sharp Decline, The Surrounding Environment Is Unfavorable, and The Actual Demand Is Not Smooth. The Sales of 20-Count Wufu Shepherd Stale Goods Have Stalled. Therefore, The Long Side Has Discovered Terror, and A Certain Manufacturer With The Strongest Power Has Adopted A Negative Attitude. The Han Gang Has Reluctantly Cut And Closed, Selling More Than 10,000 Packages Of The Yarn It Has Entered. Therefore, The Market Plate Has Taken A Sharp Turn Downward. However, The General Profit-Takers Take The Opportunity To Clear The Air. Judging From The General Trend, There May Be A Spin At Present.</p>
<p>The Human Mark Is Greatly Weakened The Human Mark Opened The Market With Mixed Ups And Downs In American Cotton. People's Hearts Were Calm. Later, Yudah And Shenxin Hao Sold A Large Number Of Them In The Recent Month, And The Market Shook And The Situation Greatly Weakened. Each Fell By More Than One Or Two. In The Afternoon, It Was Heard That The Han Gang Had Ended More Than 10,000 Packages. The Market Trend Was Still Loose, And Although There Were More Than 1,000 Packages Of Yunnan Gang's Coarse Yarn Transactions, People's Hearts Were Still Tired.

<p>The Cotton Market Is Slightly Tired And The Downward Trend Is Gradually Rising. In Fact, Overseas Cotton Is Mixed With Ups And Downs, and The Current Price Is Becoming More And More Depressed. The Factories Have No Intention To Do Anything, and The Yarn Market Is In A State Of Irreversibility. Therefore, There Is No Intention To Buy Raw Materials, and Indian Cotton Has Already Absorbed Various Sources. Although The Receiving Factories Are Scarce, The People's Hearts Are Tending Downstream. However, Ningbo Gang's Promised Amount Is Still Not Relaxing. Judging From The General Trend, The Future Is Still Difficult To Be Optimistic.</p>

<p>Factory and Warehouse Goods Have Slight Transactions... Riverboat Goods Are Mostly Stopped</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 20 sources arrived in Zhabei, and the market transaction was extremely quiet due to the continuous rain and the difficulty in opening the river dikes. There was no change in the high-priced goods of northern japonica. The general situation was that it was difficult to examine the riverboats. The ordinary Zhongguan in the warehouse barely opened a few copies, and the price was raised by about 2 corners. The market trend was based on the fact that the rainy weather improved people's hearts, so it was quite firm and rising. Japonica and Du Japonica also rose by 1 corner and a half. Transactions were also limited to warehouse goods, and the remaining low-grade japonica rice and white yuan and other goods all tended to be depressed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were 20 boats on the way to South Shanghai, and the sales were bleak due to the overcast and rainy weather, but the market atmosphere was very good. White japonica opened slightly, and the market price rose by about 2 corners. The top-quality goods of Changxi were rare, and the ordinary goods of Su and Tong were the majority. Although the unified market had transactions, the opening of the dikes was extremely small. There were turns in the market for low-grade japonica rice and early rice in South Shanghai. The market was generally firm by 1 corner. The stock of japonica rice in the river was not prosperous, and the factory and warehouse had a slight amount of Du japonica, which was more abundant. The market prices were also tight by 1 corner and a half. After each party reached a decision, the opening of the dikes changed slightly, except for the riverboats. The situation was flat, and the transactions were few.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Passenger Japonica's Street Sales Market Turned Active <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The inventory is less than 10,000 packages... There is a gradual flow</p>
<p>Yesterday, passenger japonica was still active, because the number of boats arriving downstream decreased after the rain. The street was paying attention to the passenger japonica. More than 2,000 packages were traded, and the market was also slightly stronger than the previous day. However, the arrival of South Rice was gradually increasing, and there were many goods on the way. The various rice in Nanjing were rushing to be in the city within the year. Although the market was active, the arrival of goods affected the market, making it difficult to rise step by step. However, the inventory in Shanghai was less than 10,000 packages. Xiang Rice, Nanjing, and Wuhu rice were all gradually arriving and flowing, and there was not much accumulation. Therefore, the market price within the year was not easy to fall. Yesterday, the unified market opened 200 packages of early Jiangxi rice, with a price of 10 yuan and 02 corners, 100 packages of late Jiangxi rice, with a price of 11 yuan and 2 corners and 2 fen, and 50 packages of Jiangxi rice, with a price of 13 yuan and a half. More than 1,000 packages of Nanjing brown rice, with a price of 8 yuan and 7 corners and 3 fen to 8 yuan and 4 corners. 250 packages of Hunan machine oil rice, with a price of 11 yuan and 2 corners and a half, and more than 300 packages of machine Jing rice, with a price of 11 yuan and 3 corners to 11 yuan. The oil rice was more than 100 packages, with a price of 9 yuan and 8 corners.</p>
<h3 id="e196">The Flour Market Re-enters a Sluggish State <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the prices for various months showed an initial stability followed by a continued sluggishness. At the initial opening, due to the lingering effect of the previous week's sharp rise in monopolized goods, although the current month opened at 2 taels, 1 qian, 6 fen, and 2.5 li, it quickly retreated as those holding a lot of stock released it. The local sales network also adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the market appeared quiet. When the market opened in the afternoon, because those holding a lot of stock continued to release it and factories did not increase their purchases, the quoted prices for various months became sluggish again. However, the weakening of the market is probably a necessary correction. As for the future, people are gradually realizing that there is not a lot of flour in stock, and when it reaches a certain level, it will still show a positive outlook. As a result, the current month fell 1.5 fen compared to the previous weekend, the first month fell 1.5 fen, the second month fell 1 fen and 2.5 li, the third month fell 1.5 fen, the fourth month fell 7.5 li, and the fifth month fell 1 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Forward Wheat Recovers Due to Short Covering <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the forward wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market for various months generally showed stability. The initial opening for the current month was soft due to the reported price of Canadian wheat at 3 to 4 jiao, while Chicago showed little change. However, a large amount of short covering occurred. It is speculated that the reason is related to the fact that this year's Canadian wheat has been tested repeatedly, and its body and weight are shorter than in previous years. In addition, the exchange rate has shrunk significantly, and the pricing is not favorable, so those shorting the market are not as inclined to do so as before. On the other hand, those engaged in short covering are also quite enthusiastic, so the market for various months has shown a good trend. As a result, the current month rose 4 fen compared to the previous weekend, the first, second, and third months remained unchanged, and the fourth and fifth months rose 2 fen. The current wheat factory remains quiet and has not started operations yet.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Forward Bean Cake Turns Upward, Forward Soybeans Slightly Firm <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The forward bean cake market saw a good performance yesterday, originating from the extremely active trading of the May contract, especially attracting attention from inland buyers. Currently, continuous good news reports and rising margins have boosted confidence, resulting in a strong market in the afternoon. The April contract opened at 1 tael, 5 qian, and 4 fen, up 1.5 fen. The May contract opened at 1 tael, 5 qian, 5 fen, and 7.5 li, also up 1.75 li.</p>
<p>The forward soybean market turned slightly firm because inland buyers believe that the harvest in Anhui province along the Yangtze River this year will be very good, so they are mostly bearish. However, local trading houses are shifting their focus to Dalian, so the market outlook is good. Because observations differ, there is not much trading between the two sides. The market is only slightly better by one or two fen compared to the previous weekend.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Break the 8-Tael Barrier <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Factory's white ice sugar price rises by 2 qian.</p>
<p>Taikoo Sugar releases 4,000 bags.</p>
<p>Raw sugar and white sugar are offered at 800 tons.</p>
<p>The market is quite good, and the upward trend continues unabated.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received no news from producing areas regarding Cuban raw sugar and New York and Javanese futures sugar. The public association market division panel took into account the surge in margins, the higher exchange rate, and stronger sentiment. In addition, the market inventory is not large, and sales in various places are becoming more active. Merchants are tightening their positions and unwilling to sell, so prices are rising sharply. The initial market price for Dutch sugar raw sugar and white sugar was 8 taels, and the sentiment was still strong, rising to 8 taels and 5 fen, an increase of 1 qian compared to the previous day. The market was also strong. Medium white sugar No. 20 reached a high of 7 taels and 2 qian from 7 taels and 1 qian. Fine sugar No. 8 was priced at 8 taels, 1 qian, and 2.5 fen, and Dutch red sugar No. 8 was priced at 6 taels and 6 qian. No. 9 was priced at 6 taels and 7 qian, and No. 10 was priced at 6 taels and 8 qian to 8.5 qian. The market was also quite firm. Japanese sugar imports and exports were chaotic and unusual. N mark reached 8 taels and 3 qian. TK mark ranged from 8 taels, 1 qian and 5 fen to 2 qian and 5 fen. YT mark ranged from 8 taels, 1 qian to 1 qian and 7.5 fen. UTO mark ranged from 7 taels and 5.5 qian to 6.5 qian. H mark ranged from 7 taels and 8 qian to 9 qian. YP mark ranged from 8 taels and 5.5 qian to 6 qian. Meiji goods were priced at 7 taels and 6 qian. J mark was offered at 8 taels. Although transactions were not very active, the market sentiment was extremely good, and the confidence was firm, with a strong sense of continued growth. Taikoo Sugar continued to release spot goods. B mark was priced at 8 taels and 5 qian. The Shanghai Gang had purchased three truckloads. TK mark, etc., were also fully available. In addition, 4,000 bags of ready-to-load goods were released, with B mark accounting for 70%, 2,800 bags priced at 6 taels and 5.5 qian, and CW mark accounting for 30%, 1,200 bags priced at 6 taels and 4 qian. The new tax increase still feels attractive. Raw sugar and white sugar for sale include 800 tons of Dutch sugar offered by Hua Xin Company, arriving at the end of the month, priced at 5 yuan and 8 jiao in Dutch currency. The Shanghai factory's white ice sugar offered 300 to 500 bags, with a price increase of 2 qian, with Ren mark priced at 10 taels and 8 qian and Qian mark priced at 10 taels and 7 qian. At the same time, the China factory also followed the market and offered sales, and the market was also firm. According to Shantou news, the new green sugar of the national product has already appeared in Chenghai, with a price of 13 yuan in Shantou, equivalent to about 7 taels and 5 qian in Shanghai. Because the price of Binghua green sugar is high, there are few inquiries. Therefore, it is not cost-effective for trading houses to transport it to Shanghai, so it cannot be delivered immediately to meet the needs.</p>
<h3 id="e200">There is Talk of a Price Increase for Wufu White Ice <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Wufu White Ice has seen strong sales recently, with each shipment selling out quickly. Currently, due to rising raw material prices and the upcoming tax increase on January 1 next year, the cost will inevitably increase. Based on the current market price of raw materials, it is difficult to make a profit. Therefore, the factory sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday, instructing the manager to hold firm and not to exchange at the original price. It is estimated that it will open at 2 qian higher than the previous market. The goods in transit should arrive in Shanghai today.</p>

<p>According to reliable sources, Russian tea purchasing agencies have recently purchased no less than 90,000 dan of Japanese tea in Vladivostok, with a price of about 25 taels per dan in Chinese silver. The most important condition of the negotiated result is a one-year grace period for payment. This move has greatly impacted the sales of Chinese tea. However, the quality of Japanese tea is not good, and it must be combined with purchased Chinese tea before it can be transported to Russia for sale.</p>

<h3 id="e203">The Women's Movement in Near Eastern Islamic Countries <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Kang</p>
<p>In the past, women in Near Eastern Islamic countries were confined to their homes, much like women in old China. However, since the successive national revolutions in countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Persia, and Afghanistan, women have been liberated along with the revolutions. With their self-awareness, the women's movement has risen in various countries in the Near East.</p>
<p>Therefore, they are now coming out of their homes and going to public schools, public courts, dance halls, and even entering the world of business. This has become a common phenomenon from Turkey to Arabia, from Egypt to Afghanistan. Western women are joining them in international friendships, and they are going to Europe to participate in international women's conferences. From observing the phenomena in women's circles in various Near Eastern countries, the trend of Europe is evident in Turkey, a steady progress is evident in Egypt, a determinism is evident in Syria where women are debating, and a clash between old etiquette and new ideas is evident in Persia, Arabia, and Afghanistan. However, everywhere a surge of awakening has arisen along with the revolutionary movements in various Near Eastern countries.</p>
<p>The recent Near East Women's Conference held in Damascus, Syria, was an unprecedented grand event in the Near East. Representatives from various Near Eastern countries delivered speeches using languages other than Asian languages. Representatives from the European International Women's Federation used French, the Persian representative used English, and the Turkish representative used fluent Arabic. The conference resolved many proposals, and the three most important goals were to implement monogamy, abolish concubinage, give women the right to choose their husbands, and abolish asceticism.</p>
<p>The veils of Islamic women have been completely abolished in Turkey. They no longer wear veils and are no longer confined to the black bars (Haerem) created for them by men. This movement to abolish women's veils began in 1912 when a woman in Constantinople abolished her veil, walked on the street, and gave speeches to women. The women's movement that arose along with the Turkish national revolution has achieved the complete abolition of women's veils. Kemal, the leader of the Turkish Nationalist Party, who practically gave women freedom in politics during the women's movement, had a great deal of influence. Therefore, modern Turkish women are striving to accept European experience. They not only want to go to school to gain knowledge, but also to work to gain economic independence. They want to find husbands who are of their own will. They want to stand alone and plan all their plans. They go to coffee shops and dance halls to practice social interaction publicly. They read the works of Lottie Russell, Shaw, and others. They wear Europeanized costumes in front of magazine or newspaper beauty judges. They devote themselves to drama and other art movements. They have broken the old Turkish model and almost completely imitated the American expatriate girls. Turkish girls are considered the happiest, freest, and most independent people among their Muslim sisters.</p>
<p>The future of Egyptian Islamic women is not as smooth as that of Turkish women, and thorns are often found on their road to liberation. Orthodox Muslims believe that there is no clear record in the "Quran" that women should wear hats. Therefore, after the publication of "The Emancipation of Woman" by the leader of the national movement, Gui Si Amin (Zasimin Amin), more than a dozen books were immediately published to resist him. However, Gui Si Amin had already grasped the hearts of many people, and even at Al-Azhar University in Cairo, he had his students. He advocated reforming marriage, reforming divorce and polygamy laws, advocating equality for women, and advocating the abolition of women's veils, which caused great opposition at the time. However, later even Rushdi Pasha's first wife also wrote two books in support of Gui Xin Amin's claims.</p>
<p>After the efforts of many pioneers of the women's movement, today several famous magazines in Cairo, Egypt, have women serving as editors. The most famous female writer is Nary Ziade. She is a Christian girl from Mount Lebanon in Syria. Her home in Cairo is a magnet for men and women of various religions in the city. She uses the pen name Mary to publish her articles on women's issues and literary works. Before long, she became a powerful authority in the women's movement, not only in Egypt, but her works have become the only reading material for readers in the Arabic-speaking world.</p>
<p>In Syria, Muslim women also participate in social affairs and literary and artistic celebrations. However, the abolition of veils is not as courageous as that of Turkish women. Although they oppose the old traditions, they ultimately do not obtain the freedom they expect. Therefore, they do not even have the courage to take off their veils. It is even more difficult to obtain economic status like Turkish girls. Only in clothing have Syrian women adopted the style of the Paris Boulevord. When walking on the street, they often attract people's attention. However, recently a group of women who admire European fashion have also attempted to overthrow all the old etiquettes. In Damascus, that bastion of etiquette, someone has already raised the banner of resistance. Moreover, the women's conference held in Damascus recently has taken steps to follow all the great achievements of Turkish women in its proposals, and they will surely be able to obtain a bright future.</p>
<p>Therefore, today women in Syria, Palestine, and Iraq (Iraq) are all engaged in various business endeavors. Whether they are Christians, Muslims, or Druze (Iruse) from Mount Lebanon, they are all working together to cultivate their economic status. Although they differ in religious beliefs, they all agree on economic and political organization and acquisition. They all recognize education as the only good tool for success. Therefore, the education movement that has risen in the four major cities of Jerusalem, Damascus, Beirut, and Baghdad is much stronger than the Paris fashion movement. Twenty years ago, there were only twenty Muslim girls engaged in reading in Beirut. However, according to statistics released by the Education Committee today, this city alone has exceeded one thousand people.</p>
<p>Beirut is the leading center of education in recent times. There are many local and foreign schools, colleges, and universities, and the style is better than any city in the world. However, before the European War, women's schools were entirely established by foreign churches. Muslim parents opposed sending their daughters to heretical church schools. After the European War, all foreign church schools were closed. Syrian woman Mary Kassab (Marv Kassab) opened a local school in an English church. In a few years, the number of students increased from twenty to three hundred, causing a passion for women's education in neighboring countries. Until today, in Palestine, Iraq, Damascus, and all Arabic-speaking countries, Muslim, Christian, and Bannon mountain Druze women who are engaged in various businesses all come to Mary Kassab's Ahlyah School to study. She has no secret of success. Although knowledge and enthusiasm are praised by others, the fact that it is run by Syrians is the first key secret.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Before the Wine Vessel <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Su Ling</p>
<p>On Sunday night, Zhi Ren and I walked out of a small movie theater. The tears brought on by the tragic story in the film were still moistening our eyes, and our hearts were surging with endless melancholy. So we both felt like having some wine.</p>
<p>I meant to find a small Western bar, but Zhi Ren wanted to eat some Chinese food. After walking to the end of a quiet street, we entered an old-fashioned Chinese restaurant. Like the European Cafe, it was filled with all kinds of people, so we could hear all kinds of news inside. Places like this have a considerable history, and all the decorations and tableware are still in the style of the old century. This is precisely why it has those customers, and those customers also have a history with it.</p>
<p>Amidst the clamorous talking, arguing, fist-fighting roars, waiter responses, chopstick clatter, glass clinks… and the mixed smell of wine, meat, and various dishes… Zhi Ren and I found half a table to sit at.</p>
<p>So we slowly sipped the white rose in our glasses.</p>
<p>"Ah, since I came back from the south, it's been almost two months, and I've only had wine once, at a relative's house with some old gentlemen, two glasses of aged wine. This is the second time I've had wine. It's strange, I never have the mood to drink alone. Zhi Ren, you can imagine how lonely my life has been."</p>
<p>"But my loneliness is simply turning me into a bell in an empty hall."</p>
<p>"But you still have groups of young students to talk to. From the souls of these little ones, you will no longer be lonely."</p>
<p>"Ah, have you ever experienced the terrible mechanical nature of that kind of life?"</p>
<p>"Alas, I'm just hoping to have such a regular life, otherwise my neurasthenia will have no way to be cured. This illness makes me suffer."</p>
<p>So I raised my glass. I knew very well that the liquid in the glass would have a worse effect on my illness, but I had no right to stop it from pouring into my stomach.</p>
<p>Silence lasted for a while because our mouths were stuffed.</p>
<p>"The pain of life often makes me recall the joys of the past and become pessimistic," Zhi Ren said.</p>
<p>"This is the greatest crisis for young people. Zhi Ren, the pain of my life is even greater than yours. Memories of the past are unavoidable, but I am confident that I am not pessimistic at all. I am still pursuing things. You see, since I left school, my passion has remained."</p>
<p>"I believe that very much."</p>
<p>"Like Zhi Chang, who lives in Sichuan, his letters are always full of sentences saying that the past is unbearable to look back on. My replies are all urging him to rekindle his passion, but there is no way. The burdens of life are the greatest scourge for young people. People like us who have no wives and children are still considered lucky."</p>
<p>Zhi Ren only sighed.</p>
<p>"Sometimes thinking about the past is indeed interesting. Zhi Ren, do you remember when we first met in Nanjing?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the friends in Nanjing back then, there's no news from them now."</p>
<p>"At that time, you first lived with Zou Xiaoying and the others in the picture mounting shop on Huapai Lou, and later moved to Hanximen."</p>
<p>"Alas, I don't know where they went."</p>
<p>"He was completely a child."</p>
<p>"We moved from Hanximen to the sports field again."</p>
<p>"In short, that year passed by in a daze."</p>
<p>"We can say we were destined to be together. Later, we came to Shanghai together again."</p>
<p>"Coming to Shanghai, we met Zhi Chang and the others again."</p>
<p>"Ha, that winter, Zhi Chang pursued Kai very enthusiastically."</p>
<p>"Like Zhi Chang, he is always a lucky person. Friends generally say that. 'Only Zhi Chang is maintaining his relationship with K very peacefully.' But because the time is not long, Zhi Chang is good at flattering women, but if love passes by like this, peacefully, it can indeed save regret in the future."</p>
<p>"So, Zhi Chang returned to Sichuan. How can a crazy person like you talk about love?"</p>
<p>"The failure or success of love doesn't matter, but I made so many enemies because of it. At first, it was Lao Li, and finally, there was Lao Guan. I strongly deny their attitude."</p>
<p>"Although Zhi Chang had a good beginning and a good end with Kai, your relationship with Kai did have a passionate process at one point. I'm afraid Zhi Chang can't compare to you."</p>
<p>"Precisely because of this, once love reaches its climax, it will sooner or later lead to a possible rupture. In fact, everything is like that."</p>
<p>"According to general talk, that's all because you make women too disappointed in love. Although I left Shanghai in the latter half of last year and didn't see your ending."</p>
<p>"I fully admit my faults. I once swore that if possible, I would repent to her, ah."</p>
<p>"Yes, now your life and attitude have changed from movement to stillness, from constant jumping to silence. That's largely due to her influence."</p>
<p>"Of course, but this trip to the north also gave me a lot of stimulation. However, the surface is still, but perhaps the heart is even more turbulent. Do you believe it?"</p>
<p>"Your trip to the north was also due to her influence."</p>
<p>"The lack of order in life in the north made me feel extreme pain, so I hurriedly returned to the south."</p>
<p>"Ah, thinking about it, if you hadn't met Lao Xu at the entrance of the New World, I'm afraid you wouldn't have known that I was also in Shanghai, and I wouldn't have known that you would be back from the north. When I left Shanghai and returned to my hometown for half a year, I was given a great lesson. Before, I always believed that if I couldn't make a living outside, I could always go home. Who knew that reality is the opposite of this idea. There will be no place for me to eat at home anymore. So I can only come to Shanghai and do this mechanical thing. Fortunately, Lao Fan kept it for me."</p>
<p>"Thinking about Lao Fan, it's also unfortunate that his dream of being an official has been realized again."</p>
<p>"He wrote in a letter that he lost more than 3,000 yuan. He only did a month or two of being an official and will soon come to Shanghai."</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>"Ah, these past events, these past events..."</p>
<p>So I sipped the last drop of wine. Zhi Ren smiled and said,</p>

<p>"If we imagine the future, what will we be like in a year or ten years?"</p>
<p>"Either surrounded by children or remaining a bachelor forever. In short, I will definitely be a bachelor."</p>
<h3 id="e205">The Freshman Society at Tongji <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yong</p>
<p>Tongji, which has always been filled with a dull atmosphere, has seen an unusual level of activity in academic organizations this semester. The ordinary and gloomy school life of the past has suddenly taken on a vibrant momentum. Recently, the emergence of the Freshman Society is truly an alarm bell in the dull atmosphere, a new phenomenon in student organization.</p>
<p>The "Freshman Society" was originally named "Green Society." This was the temporary name used before the official establishment of the general meeting. Later, it was changed to "Freshman Society" after being passed by all members. The intention of this naming is to "abandon the dull old life and create a new life for the future."</p>
<p>Although the society has few members, the spirit of unity and perseverance has not diminished slightly due to the small number of people. They are still sparing no effort in promoting the society's affairs, so the society's future is truly immeasurable. Moreover, even in the midst of busy coursework, they are still working hard to publish the first issue of the wall newspaper, which was published last Wednesday. The newspaper contained the following words:</p>
<p>"Because we are dissatisfied with the ordinariness and monotony of this life, the dull and suffocating atmosphere, and even more unwilling to decline in this way, we have organized this 'Freshman Society' to seek the connection of feelings and the unity of spirit among students so that this ordinary and boring school life can be improved. At the same time, we further hope that in the future, we can contribute to all students, build for the school, fulfill our responsibilities to society, and assume the mission of the times."</p>
<p>From this, the general spirit can be seen.</p>
<p>It is heard that the second issue will be full of short, concise, and interesting texts to entertain readers and is now scheduled to be published this Friday.</p>
<h3 id="e206">The Crisis of Youth in Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Yehong</p>
<p>Since the National Revolutionary Army launched its campaign, the millions of civilians in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces have been in the midst of artillery fire every day. In addition, due to the recent looting by bandits, the two provinces have become desolate, with millions of people fleeing and starving to death or freezing to death every day. The facts in Changsha and Ji'an can be imagined from the suffering of the people in these two provinces.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the finances of the two provinces are very difficult. What slaughter tax, brokerage tax, and post-disaster donation are collected every month to supply government expenses, military expenses, and education expenses? Only four or five percent is paid out each month. The schools that have already been opened are in jeopardy. Schools that have been burned down by bandits, of course, cannot be opened. Better professors have run to Tianjin and Shanghai. The economy of the society is bankrupt, and a group of suffering people cannot even seek food and clothing for themselves. How can they have money to send their children to school? The path of reading for these tens of thousands of young people is blocked.</p>
<p>Since the path of reading for young people is blocked, having read some books and knowing a few words, they can only run to the political world to seek a position. Who knew that in the current political world, one cannot get a job without an introduction? Moreover, there are mostly youth who have become Red and the government does not recognize youth seeking jobs. This road is also unworkable.</p>
<p>Young people who have no books to read and no jobs to seek can only open a small shop in the city to escape disaster and make a living if their families have a little money. The number of small shops in Nanchang and Changsha is increasing every day, but the population in the market is declining. Apart from buying daily necessities, who else buys odds and ends? Moreover, with so many shops, business is scattered. Young people have no experience, so most of them lose money. In addition, the life of holding a small room and managing the accounts has no fun at all. They are unwilling to take this road.</p>
<p>Young people coming out of schools mostly have teacher-student relationships in the education field and can only try to get a position as an elementary school teacher or a middle school clerk. There are only twenty or thirty elementary schools in the city, and most of the rural elementary schools have been burned down. Tens of thousands of young people are competing for twenty or thirty positions. Where is there enough to distribute? The road of education is also unworkable.</p>
<p>Young people closed in by high walls have no way to make a living and can only take two downward roads:</p>
<p>The first road: Suicide</p>
<p>The second road: Becoming a bandit</p>
<p>Recently, newspaper reports of youth suicide can often be seen in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. Aren't the bandits in these two provinces now mostly young people under the age of thirty being used by others? It is truly a pity that these tens of thousands of brave and promising citizens are being sacrificed in this way.</p>
<p>If we want to rescue the youth in these two provinces now, the first step is for the government to fundamentally find ways to provide relief. There are many methods of relief, such as establishing:</p>
<p>(1) Student Loan Offices: Students who truly have no money to study or students who have no money due to natural disasters can be proven by the local government and given a loan for tuition.</p>
<p>(2) Student Job Placement Offices: Students who have just come out of school have vague and ignorant knowledge of all the paths in society. The government should introduce jobs based on their school performance and personality to avoid wandering.</p>
<p>(3) Implementing work-study education: All the daily work and employees in the school can be handled by students, and the money can be given to students to study, or printing plants and manufacturing plants can be set up in the school for students to work in their spare time.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there are many things that can be done to provide relief to young people, as long as the government plans and implements them, it will be of great benefit to the country and society. Otherwise, if this continues, the future is unimaginable.</p>
