<p>各隊須合作····由全國體育協進會主持</p>
<p>（八月三十星洲通訊）最近二月内、國内著名足球隊、如中華遠征足球隊·南華·中華先後來坡、僑胞本愛國觀念、每予熱烈之歡迎、而本坡永安堂主人胡文虎尤盡地主之誼、蓋胡君提倡體育之熱誠、國内外不可多得之人物也、惟胡君鑒於南來球隊、因不能集中人才、致實力未臻堅强、深爲憾事、特作『爲南征各足球隊進一言』一文、以忠告各球隊、並盼全國體育協進會起而主持其事、當收事半功倍之效也、茲將胡君原文錄下、此次南華·樂華（即中華遠征足球隊）·中華·三足球隊相繼南征、各隊隊員自身、獲得藝術土觀摩之益、於南僑體育界則無形中給予激勵促進之力、而我大多數之父老兄弟、亦因以博得鑒賞各健兒藝術表演之限福、其事甚盛、顧三隊健兒之藝術、雖大致不差、而攻守之必具優點、則各有長短、未能盡善、因此獲勝固多、有時亦不免爲敵隊所算、此則甚可惜者也、夫足球隊遠征異國、在中外觀瞻之下、勝負之道雖微、國體之榮辰　焉、吾人深信合三華之健兒、成一隊之勁旅、不特橫行南邦、可以戰無不勝、攻無不克、即遠征歐美、與碧眼紫髥之徒、競一日之長短、亦未必多讓、惟其分而力弱、甲隊長於攻、而後衛空虚、敵兵叩關、每開門而揖盜、乙隊後防雖强、而前線太弱、不能戰者亦不易以守、兩對攻守各有所長、而全隊偶有弱點、有時牽一髪而全身遂動、球戰之日、軍行不和、全場　然、垂頭喪氣、壁上觀者且如是度各隊健兒、處處局中、必極今烈後之感惠、</p>

<p>— 天涯淪落者</p>
<p>曦社歌劇部第一次公演『王昭君』。在北四川路横浜橋新東方劇塲。事前承該社職員桂公創君相邀。於九月四日晚七時許往觀一過。所見頗多可誌。爰誌之。</p>
<p>劇中的主角是李麗蓮女士。扮演昭君。據某君說。伊是很富於感情的。所以演來極哀夗致。第三幕昭君獨唱一闋。由李女士用『粤謳調』歌曲。聲音嘹亮。令人想見嶺南民歌的情調的一斑。而起愛好的美感。張君爕君扮的元帝。古衣古裝。用歐洲調歌出。誠如該守劇本首頁朱應鵬先生所說。『戲劇雖則表現人生。不過有空間性。也要有時間性。牠所表現的應該是時代的反應。『舊瓶子裝新酒』。雖則是近於滑稽。但實在也含有眞新』。又云『有意義的新劇。在題材上不妨取之於古代。但古代的戲劇應該給予一種新的解釋。賦予一種新的生命』。這樣說來。張君把漢代的事實用歐西調歌出。或者是含有新的生命的成分嗎。再像胡曼倩女士扮的宫人。態度自然。表白清晰。李化君的呼韓邪。和扮番騎的四五位。化裝、表情、聲調。粗豪叱咤。令人想見當年横蠻的胡兒的狀態。其餘像周鵑紅君鞠躬如也的御史。和黃惶君老態龍鍾的掌典。以及幾位小妹妹裝的活潑潑的長安小兒。都很佳妙。演員旣是這樣。佈景劇情又還灯稱最難能可貴者。是演員有粤人。但操標準的國語。很是是流利。這天是該社公演的第二天。成績已斐然可觀。聴說一直要演到月底。十天換一個節目。那麽以後當然更是熟練可觀了。愛好戲劇的諸君。何妨去實地觀察一下呢。</p>

<p>因此。法者最初努力之標。乃在使有關公衆秩序及商業活動等之法律。漸歸一致。其最初公佈通行全國之法律爲一刑事訴訟法。嘻數種關於國籍之規定及一關於公司條例之規定。此外並公佈一法令改正發梭微區域對於女權之規定。因該項煊束縛已婚婦女之才能。與波蘭其他各地通行之法制相抵觸也。至其餘各項。則以前通用之數種法律大都認爲有效。不過新立一法令以便解决此同時存在之各種法制所發生之司法糾紛而已。</p>

<p>本報篇幅有限。記者不能於此將波蘭内政統一上之種種困難。一一縷舉。作更專門之研究。但即上所述。已可見波蘭政府於萬難之中對於行政與司法兩方面力謀統一之一斑。現在成績雖未能盡滿人意。然而有可原諒之點。其前途雖充滿困難。但以波蘭全國一致希望内政統一之故。政府工作較易進行。可無疑也。</p>
<p>抑有進者。波蘭内政之能統一與否。不止關係波蘭人并利害已也。實與全歐和平有極大影響。倘波蘭徒有統一之名。而全國各地司法行政等制度此與彼異。一仍瓜分時代之舊貫。是波蘭之危。亦歐洲和平之危也。反之。倘波蘭能铝實一致。整個結合。則國勢日增。可爲中歐諸强之一緩衝地帶。與和平前途關係非小矣。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　翠竹斑們伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女塊離</p>
<p>因爲有了這個印象。翠筠心目中。以爲寗波老人如此的可怕。對於寗波人未免談虎色變。以爲寗波女人人都是雌老虎了。基實中呢也不盡然。他們的男人有一種敢作敢爲的性質。女人當然也有這敢作敢爲的勇氣了。翠筠對於章乙青。雖然年紀覺得大一些。倒也還好。就怕寗波老人的威勢。有點吃不消。不免有些兒躊躇。可是章乙青再三的要求。甚而至於跪下來求伊應的事也做到了。翠筠又向他的知已朋友。常常同他一淘來的人。細細打聽。章乙青所說的話。確没有一句誑話。確是有一個老婆。住在寗波鄉下。没有到過旧海來。確是章乙青一年回寗波去一趟。而且有時連一趟也不回去。這個老婆。可以算得有若無。除了高興寄幾個錢到鄉下去以外。姨像一點没有關係了。那位朋友又告訴伊。章乙青的老人。完全是一個粗笨而難看的鄉下女人。給你三小姐比起來。只好做你的粗做娘姨。翠筠道。那也不能如此說。常言道。先進門三日爲大。無論如何。伊總是『横闊豎。』我總是『七大八。』那朋友道。我們這位乙青哥。有了你三小姐這樣的人。自然也心滿意足了。你又不到寗波去。住在上海。誰不呌你太呢。翠筠又在他的朋友那裏。探聽章乙青的身世。據那位朋友說。章乙青從小是很苦的。初來上海時。在小錢店裏學生意。連先生的夜壺也要倒的。但是他很喫苦。因爲他的一位爺叔。在後馬路一家錢莊裏做老司務。他靠了他爺叔的這點勢力。纔薦到這個生意。倘然歇了出來。就没人能薦了。後來因爲自已刻苦能幹。纔升到了這個局面。不是有眞本事的人。怎能到此地位。現在上海商界中。總算有他這個人了。外國人也相信他了。那是眞不容易的事呀。這些朋友。都是和章乙青的調的。都是所謂鑲邊客人。每天跟着他的轡頭。供他奔走。那裏有什麽眞話。一陣胡吹亂拍。翠筠却信以爲眞。以爲博諮周詢。朋友都是異口同聲。當然靠得住的了。寗波老人旣然在鄉下。不見得會到上海來。在上海自然惟我獨尊了。再加以章乙青的迷功也好。嘴頭也活絡。排塲也富麗堂皇。不到幾天。翠筠便答應收塲嫁他了。伊以爲從此脫離火坑。走上了幸福之路。總算自已的身體。有了歸不了。</p>

<h3 id="e5">Two Problems in the Midst of Commercial Depression <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the overproduction of various countries around the world has been impossible to contain. As a result, the business world has brewed a slump. The most obvious manifestation of this is the repeated stock price declines in the United States and the increasingly intense rubber price declines in various parts of Southeast Asia. The only way to maintain it is to find ways to prevent it from falling further. Therefore, the United States mostly advocates fixing market prices for maintaining securities. Various parts of Southeast Asia mostly advocate restricting production for maintaining rubber. However, fixing the market price will inevitably be a blow to other areas and provoke other types of trends. This is why Witner, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, does not advocate fixing the market price. Limiting production will inevitably affect factories first, and the number of unemployed people will also increase. This is why the governor of the Dutch East Indies does not advocate restricting production.</p>
<p>The fact that the president of the US Stock Exchange does not advocate fixing stock prices and the governor of the Dutch East Indies does not advocate restricting rubber production does have solid reasons. However, apart from these methods of fixing and restricting, there are no other methods that can maintain their business. This is why their advocacy has been refuted by opponents and will inevitably fail. However, if the opponents argue against fixing the market price and restricting production, the business price may be temporarily maintained or may not fall as much for a while. But what measures will be taken to remedy the disputes caused by fixing the market price and the increase in unemployment caused by restriction? I am afraid that they have no grasp of it. In this tide of commercial depression, there are many such problems. Is it easy to benefit all parties without harming them? Only by weighing the pros and cons and not allowing it to be too biased can it be a good strategy. Today's words of maintenance are only like this. Furthermore, according to a Washington dispatch, in order to reduce unemployment, the United States is tightening restrictions on foreign immigration and instructing consuls abroad to carefully issue entry passports. Are these measures suitable for the current era? Maintaining unemployment in this way only harms foreigners and only increases international resentment.

Daily passenger and freight revenue of 25,000 yuan is insufficient to cover expenses, and the monthly interest of 200,000 yuan on Japanese debt in the second half of the year will be quite difficult. 4,000 tons of freight cars were purchased from Belgium and are expected to arrive in October.

<p>Decision to convene an international conference next year.</p>
<p>The sudden departure of the Foreign Minister from Geneva</p>
<p>has aroused much speculation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 9th: The League of Nations Administrative Council decided to convene an international conference here in 1931 to curb counterfeit currency.</p>
<p>National News, Geneva, 9th: The International League of Nations Administrative Council convened at 11:00 AM on Tuesday. Among the more important items on the agenda are the reorganization of the cultural cooperation agency, issues related to ethnic minorities, and France's request for the withdrawal of the Franco-Belgian garrison from the Saar region. Regarding the withdrawal of troops from the Saar, Briand and Curtis had already reached an understanding during their morning meeting, awaiting only the approval of the Administrative Council. Former US Minister to China, Mark Mou, arrived here yesterday. Although Mr. Mou is a university professor, it is widely believed that he is an unofficial observer sent by the US government, and therefore attracts much attention.</p>
<p>National News, Geneva, 9th: At today's meeting of the International League of Nations Administrative Council, the former Foreign Minister reported on the work of the Mandates Commission, mentioning Britain's plan to merge the mandated territory of East Africa with the British colonies of Kenya and Uganda, stating that Britain had guaranteed to consult the Mandates Commission before making a decision, and therefore hoped that the commission could discuss the matter at its meeting in October. Subsequently, the German Foreign Minister rose to declare his reservation of the right to raise the discussion again in the future. The meeting then passed the Commission's report. In addition, two other cases were discussed: one concerning the Free City of Danzig, and one concerning the railway protection force in the Saar region. When the second case was discussed, the Foreign Minister unexpectedly read out his report, and the French Foreign Minister immediately proposed to postpone the discussion so that the German and French representatives could have the opportunity to study the report. The German Foreign Minister rose to second the proposal, and at the same time stated Germany's opinion that since the Rhineland had been evacuated, there was no need to place an armed protection force on the railway in the Saar. The unexpected departure of the Foreign Minister from Geneva this evening has aroused much speculation. The Japanese League of Nations, Geneva, 9th: The British Foreign Minister Henderson, who is attending the International League of Nations Council, met with journalists from various countries today and expressed his views on the Franco-Italian naval negotiations after the London Conference, saying that French and Italian Foreign Ministers Briand and Grandi will meet in Geneva to discuss this issue.</p>

<p>The European Union Plan Lacks Vitality in Geneva; The Result of Submitting it to the General Assembly for Discussion is Unlikely to be Satisfactory; National News, Geneva, 9th: Those who oppose Briand's European Union Plan are satisfied with the results of yesterday's meeting of representatives from various countries, and expect that the plan will be shelved after it is submitted to the League of Nations Parliament. Those close to the British delegation used the phrase "Mother lives while son dies" to describe the decision of the meeting. However, the German delegation expressed regret, repeating the words spoken by German Foreign Minister Curtius to visitors on Monday night, stating that the idea of a European Union Plan is progressing slowly but is underway, and Germany is very grateful to Briand for initiating this proposal and will sincerely cooperate.</p>
<p>National News, Geneva, 9th: French newspapers have varying comments on the results of the secret meeting on the European Union Plan in Geneva. For example, Le Matin claims that it is expected that there will be a discussion of significant issues on Thursday. The Petit Journal solemnly declares that the League of Nations Parliament is a sovereign body, and we have no intention of attacking its power, but we should advise it to allow European countries to consider for themselves whether this plan can be implemented. L'Echo de Paris claims that Briand has managed to save the broken boat and keep it afloat for the time being, but its success or failure will depend on what happens after Thursday. In addition, most newspapers expressed regret that the discussion on Monday failed to revitalize the plan, which was unexpected.</p>
<p>Indian Women Organize to Welcome</p>

<p>Thirty People Arrested</p>
<p>Heavy Rain in Bombay Waist-Deep</p>
<p>Border Tribes Still Active</p>
<p>Reuters, Calcutta, 9th: When Gandhi's female student, the Englishwoman Miss Slade, arrived here today from Madras, Indian women organized to welcome her. The police ordered them to disperse, but the crowd threw stones, injuring one police chief and two European policemen. The police arrested thirty women and searched the Asutosh building adjacent to Calcutta University. Ten students and ten non-students were injured.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 10th: There were eighteen hours of rainfall here in eight hours, and the streets have become rivers. Cars are stuck in the water, resembling small islands. Trains and trams have stopped running. Merchants are wearing bathrobes and wading to their offices. The water is waist-deep. The Legislative Assembly election must therefore be postponed.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: The Indian government幸 reported on the Indian situation up to September 6, saying that the northern Xia Wah border is quiet, but anti-British activities on the Guan Lan border are still worrying. On September 4, the Kara Ji village and the militia sentry post were attacked fiercely by the enemy, but they were repulsed with losses. Seven villagers were killed and nine injured, and one soldier was killed and three injured. The enemy suffered more casualties. The situation is now calm. There are signs that the enemy is regrouping in the northern Xia Wah area. The authorities have taken all necessary defensive measures. Reports from various provinces are mostly reassuring. The non-violent resistance movement in Madras has failed. The heat of resistance in the United Provinces is gradually decreasing. Progress has been made in Asan and other places. The report from Ben Zhebu is especially comforting, saying that the non-violent resistance movement has now almost stopped except for two or three areas. The labor situation in Bombay is now worsening, and there are now more than 45,000 unemployed cotton mill workers. The report also mentions the failure of the peace talks, saying that the negotiations failed due to unreasonable and inapplicable demands that were contrary to actual politics, as if they were only for propaganda purposes. However, some people suspect that the government is eager to make peace. The failure of the negotiations may temporarily increase the excitement of the non-violent resistance movement, but it can dispel the public's suspicion of the government's desire for peace. It is expected that the moderate elements will acknowledge that the responsibility for the failure of the negotiations must be borne by the National Congress because of its arrogant attitude.</p>

<p>Confusion in the Night Fight Due to Misunderstanding Reuters, Buenos Aires, 9th: Authorities deny that former President Irigoyen has been detained, saying that the government has approved his request to temporarily stay in the barracks. Today, the new government showed its military strength, with infantry, cavalry, artillery, and aircraft performing exercises. Pedestrian traffic on the streets was stopped, and all transportation was under government control. Anyone who violates martial law will be killed without mercy. Fifteen people have already been executed for looting.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 10th: A telegram from the capital of Uruguay says that former Argentine President Irigoyen and several of his important party members have been taken to a warship and are being closely guarded. The Argentine capital is now peaceful. The provisional government has dissolved the city council.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th: A telegram from the Argentine capital says that last night's bombardment was entirely due to an unfortunate misunderstanding by the subordinates of You Liebolu. As a result, seven people were killed and fifty-six injured. Initially, soldiers of the new government thought that the former president's old subordinates were preparing to attack the city, so they fired artillery as a show of force. At the time, thousands of people were excitedly celebrating General You Liebolu's successful coup. Suddenly, the guards at the post office heard the sound of artillery and turned off all the lights around the post office. The guards at the government headquarters thought that the enemy was firing from the post office, so they fired machine guns at the post office. The crowd in the street fled in panic, and thousands of busybodies quickly took up arms to prepare to fight the enemy. During the turmoil, there was a rumor that naval guns were bombarding the capital, so land artillery fired at the warships. The confused fighting lasted all night until dawn, when it was discovered that it was a misunderstanding. Everything is now calm, but the capital will be managed as an armed fortress until the danger is completely gone. Four clerks from the post office have been executed for shooting at the guards, and fifteen others have been sentenced to death for looting.</p>

<p>The government tries to avoid explaining the figures in the national defense plan.</p>
<p>Japanese Allied News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The ninth detailed examination committee of the London Treaty met at 1:00 PM today. The Privy Council members and the three government ministers attended as usual to continue discussing the issue of supplementing the military strength plan and the issue of reducing the burden. The Privy Council side has understood the issue of military strength. However, although the government refused to explain the financial figures in the national defense supplementary plan, the outline of the meeting was already decided at that time. Therefore, the Privy Council strongly demanded that the government explain the figures.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Agency, Tokyo, 10th: Since the Privy Council began its detailed examination, the position of the Minister of the Navy has been extremely difficult, caught between the Privy Council and former Chief of the Naval General Staff Kato. There are also very few supporters of the Minister of the Navy within the Navy Ministry. The Marshals seem to be putting considerable pressure on the Minister of the Navy. Under the current circumstances, the Minister of the Navy may not be in his position for long.</p>

<p>The Maritime Department showcases the ships and traffic of the mother country and colonies, and demonstrates the progress of nautical technology and equipment over the past 100 years. Various shipping companies display ship models and panoramic views, etc. The naval departments and manufacturers of various countries display nautical instruments, models and charts of seaports and docks. The Angvers Pavilion displays charts, models, and statistics of Angport docks, and compares them with docks in various countries, which is quite detailed. In addition to seagoing ships and docks, the Transportation Department also displays the latest models of trains, automobiles, airships, and dirigibles, all arranged according to the development and progress of each year. In addition, there are also displays of colonial products and machines used in the colonies. For example, in the diamond section of the Belgian Pavilion, everything from mining to polishing diamonds until they are ready to be purchased is displayed with models or real objects. Next to the Angvers Exhibition Hall, there are old Belgian streets, houses, shops, churches, police, etc., all preserving the conditions of the 1830s for comparison, which is quite interesting to tour around.</p>
<p>The exhibition hall in Liège is divided into northern and southern parts, covering a total area of ​​150 acres. The southern part is about agriculture and education, and the northern part is mainly about science and industry, covering an area of ​​more than 120 acres, forming a rectangle, which is the essence of the Liège Exhibition. Its exhibits are divided into science groups (metal science, chemical science, physical science, mineral science, medicine, science education, vocational education, etc.), industrial groups (mining industry, metal industry, machinery industry, military industry, electrical industry, chemical industry, glass and porcelain industry, textile industry, etc.), transportation groups (cars, trains, etc.), civil engineering groups, agricultural groups, etc. The metal, mining, metallurgical, machinery and electrical pavilions are the largest (the transportation and chemical pavilions are also very detailed). Among the pavilions of various countries, the French pavilion is the most perfectly arranged. Our Chinese pavilion occupies a part of the electrical pavilion and also displays as much as we can. Some criticize that the exhibits in the Chinese Pavilion are not enough to represent China's scientific and industrial progress. I ask the critics to open a list of Chinese items that should be displayed in each group according to the above-mentioned grouping methods of exhibits. Then the critics can be a positive and responsible critic. I cannot describe each exhibit in detail. However, after staying in Liège for a week and visiting it in detail, I have a lot of feelings. I will describe it and discuss it with the Chinese people. Liège is the industrial area of ​​Belgium. Its annual output reaches 12 million francs (12,000,000,000,000 francs), which is approximately equal to our country's 1,200 trillion yuan, compared to Shanghai's 300 factories, 300,000 workers, and 400 trillion yuan in investment.</p>

<h3 id="e69">An Inspection of the Jinpu Railway Line After the War <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>From Xuzhou to Jinan by Xuzhou Journalists</p>
<p>A communication from Jinan regarding the battlefield conditions along the line. After the Central Army defeated the main force of the Jin Army on the Jinpu Railway Line, the results of battles at various points along the line are sufficient for our observation. Therefore, the Xuzhou press formed a post-war inspection group for the Jinpu Railway Line to inspect the north. At the same time, the Xuzhou headquarters also dispatched Kuang Jingyou and Zhang Jichun to inspect various situations along the Jinpu Railway Line. Consequently, they jointly boarded the train northward on August 29th. The sights and sounds observed are described below:</p>
<p>Passing Through the Defense of Qufu and Yanzhou. The journalists and others departed from Xuzhou by military train at 4:30 PM on the 29th. The train was heavily congested with military vehicles and moved slowly. On the morning of the 30th, the train passed Tengxian and they immediately saw the war trenches built by Ma Hongda's troops north of Tengxian. There were also earthen bags piled up at the Liangxiadian station. At 5:00 PM, they crossed Zou County and arrived at Yanzhou. The journalists and others stayed at the Zhongxing Company. According to various circles, Ziyang suffered heavily from the war, especially the northern and eastern areas. Ershilipu Village north of the city was the site of a fierce battle when the Jin Army attacked Yanzhou. The eastern area was where the Jin Army divided its forces to launch a side attack on Yanzhou when besieging Qufu. Investigations revealed that the war zone covered more than a hundred villages, with over forty people killed, over a hundred injured, and five or six hundred houses destroyed. Much of the grain was requisitioned by the Jin Army, and the number of civilian laborers and vehicles requisitioned was considerable. The wooden doors of the residents in the city were dismantled by the defending troops to provide materials for fortifications. On the morning of the 31st, they took rickshaws to Qufu, where traces of war were visible everywhere. On the way from Yanzhou to Qufu, they saw two war trenches, one built by Ma Baolin's troops to defend Yanzhou against the Jin Army, located more than ten miles east of Yanzhou, and the other built by the Jin Army to attack Qufu, located about half a mile west of Qufu. Beside the trenches, there were still many coffins abandoned by the Jin Army, marked with the words "Deceased officers and soldiers of a certain division and regiment of the Third Route Army." After entering the city, they first went to the Duke Yansheng's Mansion. Duke Yansheng, Kong Decheng, was only eleven years old. His relative, Kong Lianfang, accompanied him to respond. Kong was too young to speak fluently. Kong Lianfang said that the sacred sites of Qufu should never have been bombarded indiscriminately. When the Jin Army's Chuan Zuo-yi division besieged the city, they fired six or seven thousand shells into the city. How could a small city like Qufu withstand so many shells? Therefore, the Kong Temple, the Yan Temple, the city towers, and the people's houses were all severely damaged. Then they visited the Kong Temple, which was grand in scale. The Hall of Great Achievement, the Sleeping Hall, the walls, and the side halls all had shell marks. In the Sleeping Hall, a shell even hit the roof ridge, broke through the ceiling, and fell down, fortunately without exploding, otherwise the hall would have been reduced to rubble. After visiting the Yan Temple, many pine and cypress trees inside the gate were withered, and the destruction was particularly severe. Half of the Xiaoxiang Hall was destroyed by shells, and the statue of Yan was exposed to the sky. The Enjoyment Hall and the Sleeping Hall were all damaged, with bullet marks everywhere. After coming out, they inspected the city towers, all four gates of which had been destroyed by shells, and many houses had also been knocked down by shells. West of Kong Forest, there were also Jin Army trenches, directly connected to the war trenches outside the west gate, showing the Jin Army's determination to attack Qufu. In the evening, they took rickshaws back to Yanzhou. One morning, they accompanied Magistrate Shi of Ziyang to inspect the war situation in Yanzhou. They climbed the city tower and looked around. All around the city wall were war trenches, interspersed with machine gun positions. The city tower was equipped with cannon positions. The parapets of Yanzhou had been demolished the year before, and now they were rebuilt with bricks. Bags were requisitioned from the people in the city and filled with earth for cover. The wooden doors of the residents were also dismantled to cover the trenches. The houses of the residents near the city, which could have provided cover for the Jin Army attacking the city, were all demolished. Although the Jin Army only surrounded the north and east sides and did not reach the city walls, the losses to the people were already huge. According to Shi, these fortifications were initially built by Ma Baolin's troops. After Chief Commander Liu arrived in Yanzhou, he ordered further construction and sent staff to guide the work. The circumference of Yanzhou was twenty-eight li, with a covered trench every thirty paces, four cannon positions at the four gates, and a total of more than 70,000 bags requisitioned. All the wooden doors in the city were dismantled and used, so there was a saying in Yanzhou that the doors were not closed at night, which was actually because there were no doors to close. Only 600 yuan was allocated to compensate for the demolished houses near the city. Other requisitions and war zones were still awaiting compensation. It was estimated that 50 million catties of firewood were requisitioned, as well as more than 3,000 civilian laborers, more than 1,000 ox carts, and more than 2,000 hand carts. The firearms of the Ziyang police force were confiscated by Ma's brigade during the defense of the city and have not yet been returned. The local area has no possibility of self-defense. They have already sent a representative to meet with Chief Commander Ma to negotiate. If the firearms are not returned soon, the local area will have no way to cope. At noon that day, they left Yanzhou and headed north. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Execution of Liu Yun by the Wuhan Garrison Command <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>And the Publication of Liu's Confession. A communication from Hankou. The Wuhan Garrison Command recently captured Liu Yun, a member of the Communist Party and the Military Commission of the Five Provinces along the Yangtze River, in Hankou. After detailed interrogation, he was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on the 7th. However, Liu's confession to the Garrison Command revealed the internal situation of Soviet Russia, the organization of the Communist Party in the Yangtze River region, and the tasks he was responsible for. Today (the 8th), the Garrison Command specifically published his confession so that the people of Wuhan could understand the crimes of the Communist Party. The following is a verbatim record: (Question) What is your name? How old are you? Where are you from? (Answer) My name is Liu Yun, pseudonym Suiwu. I am currently twenty-six years old and from Yizhang County, Hunan Province. Because I am engaged in secret work, I cannot use one name exclusively, so I also have three names: Liu Zhiming, Li Zhihao, and Song Tui. (Question) Who are the members of your family? What is their situation? (Answer) My family has always been small farmers. My mother passed away long ago, and my father is still alive, but I have not heard from him for several years, and the relationship has been severed. I heard that he is now bankrupt and in a bad state. (Question) What schools have you attended? (Answer) I have attended many schools, and my thinking has changed accordingly. It should be divided into two points: (1) The schools I attended. Before the age of seventeen, I studied at a higher primary school in my county. At the age of seventeen, I joined the Franco-Chinese Work-Study Society and worked in a factory in Paris. Later, I entered aviation school. In the twelfth year, I returned to Guangzhou, transferred from the Jiangxi Army Lecture Hall to the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy, briefly served as a trainee in the teaching regiment, and was assigned to work in the Aviation Bureau. Later, I served as the director of education and the party representative of the air squadron in the aviation school. I participated in the Eastern Expedition. In September of the fourteenth year, I was sent to Soviet Russia by the National Government to study aircraft and military affairs. I transferred to the Army University after a year in the military aviation school, focusing on military research for more than three years. I graduated and returned to China in May of this year. (2) The changes in my thinking. When I was in high primary school in my county, I was inspired by the patriotic enthusiasm of the May Fourth Movement. I believed that the crisis of saving China could only be solved by strengthening the military, so I decided to go abroad to study military affairs. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Paris, because I had no government introduction, I could not enter any military schools. This was a blow to me. At the same time, I saw that the sophistication of European and American weapons was something that the Chinese had never dreamed of, and that aircraft were particularly necessary for combat, so I joined an aircraft factory to study the structure and principles of aircraft in practice. In 1922 (i.e., the eleventh year), I saw through the changes in material civilization and the treacherous competition among the imperialists. I realized that the narrow idea of enriching the country and strengthening the military was ultimately not feasible, so I joined the Socialist Youth League in Paris. In 1923, I returned to China and joined the Chinese Communist Party. At the same time, I also joined the Kuomintang. After arriving in the Soviet Union, my spirit was absolutely entrusted to the Third International. (Question) Did you receive any mission from the Third International when you returned to China this time? Who did you contact? (Answer) My return to China this time was a mission from the Third International to have me return to specialize in military work and reorganize the Red Army in China. When I set off in Moscow, Qu Qiubai told me to stay in Harbin and wait. Someone would naturally come to contact me. After staying in Harbin for three or four days, someone came and told me to stay at the Xinmin Hotel in Shanghai and someone would come to find you. After I arrived, I stayed for two weeks. Someone surnamed Wang came to contact me and moved to another hotel for a week. I was sent to Wuhan by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, so my arrival at that place and my contact with that person were all designated in advance by the Central Committee of the Communist Party. That is, when we met, we only asked each other's names. The truth or falsehood of the names and the place of residence were not investigated. If we wanted to investigate, not only would there be no result, but it would also cause suspicion among comrades. These are all the secrets of our party that should be absolutely observed. (Question) What is your position? (Answer) I am a member of the Military Commission of the Five Provinces in the Yangtze River region, and concurrently the chief of general staff. Four or five days ago, the Central Committee also entrusted me with the responsibility of organizing the 25th Red Army. (Question) How many people are in charge of the Military Commission? Where is the organization located? (Answer) There are three responsible members of the Military Commission. In addition to me, there is one called Zhang Jun and one called Wang Yuan, but our names are always changing, and we never use real names. They tell me false names, and I only tell you what they say. Please do not investigate further. However, if you insist on me saying it, I will just say it for what it is worth. As for our organization, it has not really been established yet. I wanted to build it earlier, but because renting a house in Hankou required a wife, I lost my deposit three or four times and was unable to rent a house. If I had rented a house, it would not have been so easy to catch me this time. As for the military plan for the five provinces, because I have not been in Hankou for long and the situation in various places has not been investigated clearly, it has not yet been drafted. (Question) According to people in your party, the Yangtze River Military Commission has been established for a long time. How could there be no organization? (Answer) The Military Commission has been in operation for more than two months, but the person in charge before was Cai Zhongxi, the commander of the 7th Red Army. His attitude was very passive and he did not actively organize, so the Central Committee was deeply dissatisfied and called me to take over. I have only been here for two weeks. Since I cannot rent a house, I cannot establish an organization. (Question) Where are the basic troops of your 15th Army? (Answer) I was arrested only three or four days after receiving the mission to organize, and I have not yet started planning. However, the basic troops referred to by the Central Committee are the peasants in various counties in southern Hubei. (Question) What have you been doing since you came to Wuhan? You must be familiar with the activities of the Communist Party here and the various organizations in the Yangtze River region. Tell us about it. (Answer) I am specifically responsible for military affairs and have no connection with the party affairs of various provinces, so I do not know the members and their activities at all. As for the organization in the Yangtze River region, it is divided into two types: one is the Political Committee, which is divided into guidance and adjudication departments, and the other is the Military Commission, which is divided into staff, worker-peasant armed forces, and reporting departments, all of which are concurrently held by the members. As for what I have been doing since I came to Hankou, there is nothing much because I have not completed the investigation and do not understand the situation. However, in the military aspect, I have actually been to Snake Mountain and stayed in the alarm clock tower for two nights. I have also been to Tortoise Mountain. I know the situation in these two places. (Question) Who is in charge of the Political Committee? (Answer) I have only met with someone surnamed Zhang twice, and I do not know the others. (Question) What is the recent organizational system of the Communist Party? (Answer) It is roughly divided into three departments: party affairs, politics, and military affairs, which are roughly the same at all levels. (Question) Who are the people in charge of the Central Committee of the Communist Party? (Answer) There are five members: Xiang Zhongfa, Li Lisan, Liu Changqun, and two peasants. Xiang Zhongfa also serves as the secretary. (Question) Recently, I heard that the Central Committee of the Communist Party has plans to move to Wuhan, Yuezhou, or Honghu. Is this true? (Answer) We have not received any notification or news of this. I do not know yet. However, based on my personal speculation, many people who know Li Lisan and Xiang Zhongfa are recognized here. Under these circumstances, they will definitely not move here casually. As for other places, there are more inconveniences for commanding work, and there is no possibility of establishing a foothold. (Question) You have been in Soviet Russia for a long time. What is the situation in that country? (Answer) Inside Soviet Russia, the cadre faction and the Trotsky faction have been in fierce conflict over the past year. As a result, Trotsky failed and was expelled. The brewing has continued to this day, and the disaster is still lurking, causing all facilities to be suspended. In terms of economics, there is often a bread panic. However, the cadre faction still advocates external development and encourages the Communist Parties of various countries to actively agitate, sparing no effort. Therefore, the money to support foreign Communist Parties is also spared no effort. However, in the military aspect, the progress is extremely rapid, and aviation tactics are particularly special. (Question) Have the people of Soviet Russia actually broken the concept of the state in practice? (Answer) Although the political appearance of Soviet Russia is called the World Cannon, the concept of the state still remains in the minds of the general public. That is, the actions of overseas Chinese from various countries are ultimately not as free as those of their own nationals. However, the cadre faction is working hard to correct this. (Question) Do you sympathize with murder and arson? (Answer) Murder and arson are certainly the immaturity of party members, but usually the local tyrants and bullies oppress the peasants and workers too much. Once this is reversed, it will evolve into revenge involving murder and arson, which is an inevitable part of the process. (Question) Looking at your situation, you certainly cannot be called talented, but you are not a waste either. However, you have been away from the country for too long, and you are not familiar with the situation in the country at all. You have also been too anesthetized by the Moscow Communist Party, so Director He and our Chief of Staff Ye are very sympathetic to you. If you can not violate the teachings of our Premier, the Director and the Chief of Staff may be able to help you. Think about it carefully. (Answer) I am not a talented person, and there is no need to be sympathetic. I am a firm believer in my doctrine. Please do not say any more. I only ask to be killed as soon as possible. However, the Communist Party has lost one person like me, although it will suffer some losses, but if I had been caught two or three weeks later, and my plans had been drafted successfully, then the credit of the Investigation Department, I believe, would have been much greater than it is now.</p>
<h3 id="e71">A Bizarre Drama During Li Jihong's Inauguration Ceremony <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Xie Wugang Insults Zhang Guanshi. A communication from Hankou. Li Jihong, the special commissioner of finance in Hubei, held his oath-taking ceremony at the special commissioner's office on the 8th of this month. Many dignitaries from various circles attended, making it a grand occasion for a time. Unexpectedly, during this solemn ceremony, Zhang Guanshi, the director of the Hubei Finance Department, was suddenly slapped in the face by Xie Wugang, a guest, with the sound reverberating throughout the room. A bizarre drama thus occurred. The following is a record of the event:</p>
<p>The Bizarreness of the Speech. At 10:00 AM on the 8th, Li Jihong held a supplementary oath-taking ceremony. First, Xi Debing, the supervisory commissioner of the Ministry of Finance, delivered an instruction speech. Then, Chen Huren, the representative of the Provincial Government, and Li Shaoyang, the representative of the Acting Headquarters, successively delivered speeches, mainly stating that Special Commissioner Li was rich in financial management experience and would surely achieve good results in organizing the national taxes of Hubei in the future. They hoped that he would carry forward the revolutionary spirit and move forward. Then, Xie Wugang also stood up and gave a speech, roughly saying that comrades of the Party engaged in political work should act in accordance with the oath. Financial personnel should be especially clean and self-disciplined, and abide by the law. Zhang Nanxian and Li Jihong, the former directors of the Hubei Finance Department, could not be said to have been law-abiding. Now that Comrade Li is once again appointed as the special commissioner of finance, it is hoped that he will vigorously change his past mistakes and not be corrupt. After the speech, the onlookers were greatly surprised and suspected that Xie had a mental illness.</p>
<p>The Circumstances of the Instigation. After the oath-taking ceremony, Li invited the guests to the garden for a photo to commemorate the occasion. As Zhang Guanshi stood up to leave, Xie immediately followed closely behind him, loudly asking how much opium he had smoked this morning. Zhang replied that he had eaten a catty, using this to scold him. Xie also said that he had sent a gift to the director, but why had he not received a reply? Zhang replied that he had not received it. Xie said that he had sent it to the director's wife. Zhang said that he was being too shameless in his provocation. Before he could finish speaking, Xie's right palm had already landed on Zhang's left cheek. After the incident, Xie left with his head held high, while Zhang maintained his calm attitude and took pictures with the guests. Only after taking the pictures did he return to his private residence in anger.</p>
<p>Post-Incident Telegrams and Letters. After returning to his private residence, Zhang telegraphed He Chengjun in Luohe to report the incident, roughly saying that at 10:00 AM today, Hubei Special Commissioner Li held his inaugural ceremony, and he was invited to attend. Suddenly, someone who had represented the guests and delivered a speech ambushed him in public during the photography session and almost injured him. He asked that the person be arrested on the spot, but he was allowed to wander away. Although he himself was irrelevant, as a representative of both the military and political sides, he had no legal protection. Therefore, the government's prestige and local discipline would be completely swept away. Looking to the future, he could not help but feel cold and hoped that the reactionaries would be severely punished to rectify discipline. At the same time, the Special Commissioner of Finance's office also sent a letter to the Municipal Government and the Wuchang Public Security Bureau, requesting that Xie Wugang be arrested and brought to justice. The letter said that our Special Commissioner held a supplementary oath-taking ceremony on the second floor of the Bank of China in Hankou at 10:00 AM today. After the ceremony, he invited the guests to the photography session to take pictures as a souvenir. Suddenly, a thug named Xie Wugang insulted Director Zhang in the photography session, disrupted the order, and fled in a hurry, failing to be captured on the spot. The Director of your Municipality is requested to quickly order a search for his arrest and handle the matter in accordance with the law and report back.</p>
<p>Condolences from Dignitaries. Li Jihong and Liu Wendao took a car to Zhang Xuguan's private residence at No. 35 New Paris Street that evening to offer their condolences repeatedly. At the same time, many people came to offer their condolences, and the threshold was worn through. Today (the 9th), Zhang did not attend the 56th Provincial Government meeting and submitted his resignation. Although the Provincial Committee meeting decided to retain him, Zhang's anger seemed to not have subsided.</p>
<p>Xie Wugang Strikes Back. Xie Wugang had served in the military and had a violent temperament, but he was also quite straightforward. After this incident occurred, not only did he not try to escape, but he also went to court to accuse Zhang of dereliction of duty. Furthermore, on the 9th, he issued a declaration, stating his residential address in detail and hiring people to distribute it in Wuhan. The people of Wuhan, hearing of this strange event, all wanted to see what was going on and rushed to read it. The distributors temporarily set the price at four copper coins per copy, but the buyers were still very enthusiastic, and they quickly sold out. All the workers hired made three times their profit, which was also an interesting anecdote in this storm. (September 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">The Breach of the Yellow River Civil Embankment in Shandong <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>A communication from Jinan. The Liaoqiao civil embankment on the upper reaches of the Yellow River was breached due to continuous rising water. The civil embankment was supposed to be repaired under the supervision of the government and by the people, but the area happened to be at the intersection of Fan County, Shouzhang County, and Yanggu County, so the people of the three counties shirked responsibility to each other and refused to repair it, causing the breach to widen and the situation to become dangerous. The following is a record of the telegram from the dike defense committee: To the Director of the River Affairs Bureau, The mouth of the Liao embankment has widened to more than 130 zhang in recent days, with a water depth of 1.5 to 1.6 zhang, and the flow is three points, gradually expanding. The dike defense officer and section chief Zi Qian have repeatedly urged the county magistrates of Fan, Shou, and Yang to convene gentry and directors to discuss solutions. On the 17th of this month, the gentry and directors of Shou and Yang met in Fan County. The dike defense officers and others tried their best to mediate, almost to the point of exhaustion, but the gentry and directors of the three counties still looked at each other and there was no result or solution. At this time, the autumn flood is growing, and the river water is surging. The breach location is also at the top of a bend. If the main current moves into the adjacent river, not only will the villages along the river become a swamp, but the entire embankment of more than 100 li will also be filled with dangerous works. It is fortunate that the current has not yet completely shifted, and we should immediately start by lining the upper and lower parts of the mouth to prevent further expansion, so as to wait for the breach to be closed after the autumn. This should be more effective with less effort. However, the gentry and directors of each county do not care about the overall situation and are looking ahead without action. The dike defense officers and others are unable to reach them, and the situation has become helpless. We can only earnestly request that you quickly telegraph the county magistrates of Fan, Shou, and Yang to strictly urge the gentry and directors of each county to hold another emergency meeting to facilitate action and protect the people. [signed] Dike Defense Officer Zheng Jitai, Section Chief Zhou Ziqian, bowing, (September 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e73">An Overview of the Fisheries Administration in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The administrative measures for the fisheries industry in Jiangsu Province have been specified in the policy guidelines for the nineteenth year of the agricultural temple, such as the establishment of provincial fisheries experimental farms, marine research institutes, and preliminary fisheries facilities in Haizhou, Xinyang Port, Lusi Port, Hupu, Shengshan (representing Shanghai), etc. Although it is not easy to proceed due to the province's financial difficulties, the department is still actively planning and has not slackened. The following is a brief description of the progress:</p>
<p>Investigation of Coastal Fisheries and Patrol Vessels. The Department of Agriculture believed that the existing fisheries in the coastal counties of the province had not yet been fully investigated. In addition to the establishment of the Shengshan Fisheries Experimental Farm and the Marine Research Institute, which are important facilities, the nineteenth-year policy guidelines for the fisheries sector call for the establishment of fisheries guidance centers in the prosperous fisheries areas of the coastal counties. Therefore, a preliminary investigation is an important task. On the 8th of last month, Promotion Officer Zhang Yousheng was dispatched to Chongming, Haimen, Qidong, Nantong, and other four counties to investigate the existing fisheries as a reference for the future establishment of guidance centers. The Department also believed that the relationship between coastal defense and fisheries was close, so it sent a letter to the Wusong Coastal Patrol Office to investigate the tonnage, speed, draft, number of crew members, armed equipment, and 24-hour fuel consumption, and total monthly expenditure of the patrol vessels under its jurisdiction and those frequently traveling to Jiangsu, and to report back in detail as a reference for coastal defense in the province.</p>
<p>Preparation for the Provincial Fisheries Experimental Farm. The Department of Agriculture believed that the establishment of the Provincial Fisheries Experimental Farm in the province had long been included in the eighteenth-year budget, and a preparatory office had been set up, with a commissioner appointed to be responsible for the handling, but it could not proceed due to the province's financial difficulties. Recently, in light of the fact that Japanese fishing boats frequently come to our Jiangsu territorial waters to fish illegally, it is necessary to establish the farm as soon as possible. It was again submitted to the 315th meeting of the Provincial Government, and it was resolved and approved to start preparations immediately. Last month, Wang Wentai, the former director of the Haizhou Aquatic Products Experimental Farm of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, was added as a preparatory officer and went to Shanghai to actively prepare and speed up the process in order to establish it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Formulation of Model Articles of Association for Fisheries Associations. The Department of Agriculture believed that the Fisheries Association Law had been promulgated by the National Government and came into effect on July 1. As a result, fishermen in various counties have been organizing fisheries associations and applying for registration. However, the articles of association they drafted were mostly unusable. To save guidance procedures, the Department specifically formulated model articles of association for fisheries associations in various counties in Jiangsu Province, and guidelines for the preparation of fisheries associations in various counties in Jiangsu Province, and printed and distributed them to various counties so that fishermen could follow them and organize associations according to law.</p>
<p>Collection of Models of Offshore Fishing Boats. The forms and structures of fishing boats in this province are extremely complex. The Department of Agriculture specifically instructed the county governments of Chuansha, Songjiang, Nantong, Nanhui, Dongtai, Rugao, Yancheng, Funing, and other eight counties to take the various important fishing boat styles, materials, and dimensions of each part of the various sea-based boats under their jurisdiction and make scaled-down models according to a ratio of one-tenth for small fishing boats and one-twentieth or one-thirtieth for large fishing boats, and attach a full set of scaled-down models of the fishing gear used, along with explanatory notes, for research purposes.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Local Communications Songjiang <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Urgent Expansion of the Police Brigade. Our county is located in the center of the Shanghai-Hangzhou transportation hub, with access to all directions. Cases of robbery and kidnapping are reported from various villages from time to time. Local security consists only of one police company, which is often insufficient to mobilize when the villages are alarmed by bandits. The second county administrative meeting resolved to expand the county police into a large brigade, and the operating expenses are planned to be raised from wealthy households in the form of protection donations, which have been submitted to the provincial department for approval. After receiving the document, County Magistrate Jin ordered the district chiefs to select recruiters, who were hired by the county on file. It is now known that because the matter has been going on for a month, the actual number of recruits in each district has not yet been reported. A fast telegram was sent to the district chiefs to proceed quickly and to submit a report on the recruitment process before the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>Relocation of the 15th Substation to Caojing. Punan Shanyang and Caozhe in this county are all coastal areas where bandits come and go unpredictably. The local people applied for and were approved to establish the 15th Public Security Substation, which was organized and established in Shanyang last month and started operating. However, it is heard that the central area should be Caojing, and the housing police donations, which are used as a source of funds, are also more numerous in Caojing. Previously, the people of Caojing applied to the county government, which forwarded the request to the Public Security Bureau, and it was approved to relocate the 15th Substation to Caojing and set up a police station in Shanyang under the jurisdiction of the substation. The order has been forwarded for implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Suzhou <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Suspicion of Reactionary Activities, Requesting Instructions from the Provincial Authorities for Disposition:  After the Public Security Bureau's bicycle patrol officers Wang Du and Yu captured a suspected counter-revolutionary, Song Qin, on the anniversary of July 7th, they arrested Song Zhao-cai, Kong Shao-xi, and fifteen others. Yesterday (the 10th), the Judicial Section of the Public Security Bureau interrogated them. Song Qin confessed that he was in charge of propaganda for the Suzhou County Sports Committee, and Kong Shao-xi was the secretary. He also confessed that he had attended several meetings at the Fang Sheng Temple in the southern suburbs of the city.  The abbot of the temple, Monk Songlin, also participated in the meetings.  Songlin has also been taken into custody. After Zhang, the section chief, recorded the confessions, he instructed his subordinates to continue to secretly apprehend those involved and submitted a report to the provincial government for instructions.</p>
<p>The Water Police Capture Bandits Who Looted Wuzhen: Huai Zongbang, the captain of the 14th team of the Water Police, recently received a tip that Wang Chuanzhi, a bandit involved in the Wuzhen looting case, and a monk were hiding outside the East Gate of Wujiang. Captain Huai, acting on the tip, immediately ordered a secret investigation and apprehended Wang, handing him over to the Wujiang County Government for investigation. Yesterday, he submitted a report to the Third District for instructions.</p>
<p>Sentencing of a Large Number of Reactionary Criminals: The Second Criminal Court of the Higher Court yesterday sentenced a large number of counter-revolutionary criminals. Chen Xiaosan was sentenced to four years of imprisonment for the crime of assisting in the propagation of doctrines incompatible with the Three Principles of the People. Gao Shoufeng was sentenced to eleven months of imprisonment for the crime of joining a counter-revolutionary gathering. Zhao Fengming was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for the same crime. Chu Guan-ke was sentenced to eleven months of imprisonment for the crime of joining a counter-revolutionary organization. Ding Sijing and Yan Dunshi were each sentenced to five months of imprisonment. Lin Lou was sentenced to six months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Merchants and Residents of Guanqian Petition: Residents south of Guanqian Street, concerning the Zhao Wall of the Xuanmiao Temple, which the provincial government has ordered the Construction Department to demolish according to the original plan, dispatched nine representatives, including Xu Xunru, to the County Government yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m.  They petitioned the County Government to instruct the Construction Bureau to inform Abbot Yan to immediately demolish the wall in order to expedite the reconstruction of city buildings and see the temple's early completion. County Magistrate Huang responded that the case was still under consideration, and execution would begin as soon as the final decision from the provincial government was received. The representatives left satisfied.</p>
<p>Proposed Names for the Ring Road: The Public Security and Construction Bureaus have jointly proposed the following new names for the ring road: (1) From Qian Wanli Bridge to Xinmin Bridge, it will be called Xinmin Road. (2) From Xinmin Bridge to Guangji Bridge, it will be called Guangji Road. (3) From Guangji Bridge to Wanyuan Bridge, it will be called Puyi Road.

<p>Reporting the Establishment of the Four-County Joint Defense: The Five-County Joint Defense plan initiated by this county was ordered to convene a meeting in Fengxian on the 6th of this month. At that time, because Jinshan was not present, it was discussed and changed to a four-county joint defense of Songjiang, Fengxian, Shanghai, and Nanhui. It was also decided to establish a joint defense office immediately, with County Magistrate Shen Qingchen as the director. In addition to the two members jointly recommended by the party and government organs of this county, the members recommended by each county were Zhang Qianshou for Songjiang, Ding Jien for Shanghai, and Cai Zhuocheng for Nanhui. The Water Public Security Team sent Liu Zhao, the captain of the first battalion of the first district, to join. In addition, the party departments of each county were also invited to participate in the meeting. The monthly expenditure was temporarily set at 120 yuan, which was apportioned by each county for use. County Magistrate Shen has personally taken the approved regulations to the province today to present everything in person.</p>
<p>Soliciting Customs Surplus Treasury Bonds: The quota for this county's customs surplus treasury bonds was originally set at 60,000 yuan, but after Director Wang Zhuofu of the Finance Bureau personally went to the province to present the desolate situation, it was approved to be reduced to 40,000 yuan. According to the previous practice of allocating 20 yuan for every 100 mu of land, the bureau dispatched personnel yesterday to cooperate with the district offices to collect the bonds and issued temporary receipts from the county bureau, which will be adjusted later.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Jiashan <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Eleven Floating Corpses Discovered in Xia Mutang: The military and police jointly suppressed bandits, and the Zhi Guo warship provided cover with artillery fire. The number of bandits killed at that time is impossible to determine. Yesterday, eight floating corpses were discovered in the Xia Mutang area. The corpses were all wounded by bullets. Three of the corpses still had Mauser pistols, etc. attached. The local farmers reported the discovery and went to examine the corpses for investigation.</p>
<p>Lake Bandits Loot Two Major Towns: Detailed Report on the Robbery in Tianren Town and Youchegang: Tianren Town in Jiashan County and Youchegang in Jiaxing County were looted by lake bandits at 4:30 a.m. on the 7th. This has already been reported. According to detailed investigation, the lake bandits first destroyed the telephone lines when they arrived in the town, and then went to the Public Security Bureau and the Self-Defense Corps to confiscate firearms. They used a ladder to climb from the roof of the Ruiyu Salted Fish Shop into the Tongde Pawnshop and looted more than 1,000 yuan in silver dollars, ornaments worth about 400 yuan, and more than 100 pieces of clothing. Hengchang Qianzhuang was looted for more than 8,000 yuan in silver dollars, and two shop assistants and Xu Shaopeng, who went to Jiashan Hengtaifeng Cloth Shop to collect debts, were kidnapped. Also, the mistress of Xu Yongli Foreign Goods Shop was kidnapped for scolding the bandits, and the owner of Yufeng Clothing Shop, Zhou Ziming, and his partner, Gu Zhongyu, were kidnapped. Furthermore, Hu Zhuming was kidnapped to Qinglong Bridge near Taozhuang. He happened to encounter the suppression troops, and the two sides exchanged fire. He took the opportunity to escape. This time, more than 50 shops were looted, excluding teahouses and hotels, and dozens of households were looted, with a total loss of more than 50,000 yuan. In Youchegang Town, three rice shops, several South goods sauce gardens, and clothing shops were looted. Because it was late, the bandits were afraid of being surrounded and arrested by the police, so they dared not loot further and retreated. The Jiaxing Bandit Suppression Headquarters, the Water Police District Department, the Security Team stationed in Jiashan, and the County Public Security Bureau all dispatched teams to pursue and suppress them upon hearing the alarm. Four bandit boats and two bandit corpses were seized, along with one quick-firing gun and two wooden-cased guns. The remaining bandits scattered and fled. All the shops in Tianren Town were closed due to the huge losses this time. On the morning of the 9th, the Director of the County Public Security Bureau went to the town to persuade the shops to open together with the head of the District Public Office. The shops opened on the same day. He also went to the Tongde Pawnshop to investigate and dispatched the Director of the Ye Public Security Branch to the district head to supervise the loss from the 10th. At the same time, the local government wired the province to request troops to be stationed in the town to deter bandits.</p>
<p>Correction to the Communication on the 8th: In the looting case of the two towns, it was reported that the kiln owner Zhou Xuezhi was kidnapped.

<p>Grocery Store Employee Runs Away Due to World-Weariness: Hong Da, the 19-year-old son of Gao Shengrong, a resident of Banqiao Township, Eighth District (Huaixia City), is currently working as an employee in the Rongchang Grocery Store in Rongxiang, Kaiyuan Township. He is usually diligent in his store duties, so he is highly valued by the store owner, Chen Bingkang. Recently, Hong Da suddenly changed his usual behavior and often lamented the suffering of his life. He also repeatedly told people about going out to join the army. The matter was heard by the store owner, who often advised and comforted him. Unexpectedly, his father, Shengrong, suddenly fell ill at home the other day, and the illness was dangerous. After Hong Da heard about it, he became even more saddened and suddenly developed a sense of world-weariness. He immediately wrote a suicide note on the counter, behind people's backs, and asked Chen Bingkang, the store owner, for leave yesterday morning. The store owner approved it, and Hong Da set off for home at noon. When he arrived near the Guandi Temple on Kaiyuan Road, he entrusted someone to take the suicide note to the Rongchang Grocery Store. The original letter roughly stated that his father's illness was incurable, and his family was heavily in debt. He originally intended to commit suicide in Wuxi, but was afraid that his family would come to collect the body after hearing about it, which would cost a lot of money, so he decided to go to Shanghai to commit suicide. After reading the letter, the store owner, Chen Bingkang, immediately sent people to search for him everywhere. He also made a long-distance call to Gao Liangsheng, his younger brother, at the Dechang Iron Store of the Tianhou Palace Bridge in Shanghai, ordering him to look for Hong Da's whereabouts in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Accusation of Fraudulently Obtaining Money by Setting Up a Silk Factory: Chen, the accountant of a silk cocoon storage in Liangxi Road outside Guangfu Gate in Xiyi, is skilled in calculation and has become well-off. Recently, he set up a Rui Da Silk Factory Preparatory Office in Beitang outside the North Gate. A certain Jia from Fenshui Dun, Yixing County, recently unemployed at home and eager to find a job, asked Zhu to transfer 1,000 taels of shares in Rui Da Silk Factory to Chen, who was doing business in Shanghai. Chen agreed and gave a temporary receipt. Unexpectedly, Chen was preparing to raise a capital of 30,000 taels, but he could not raise the full amount, so he changed the name to Xuchang Run Silk Factory, and Jia waited for a long time after exchanging a share certificate. He did not see it implemented, so he negotiated with Chen. Chen avoided seeing him, and Jia has now hired Lawyer Hu Jiayu to sue the County Government, accusing Chen of setting up a situation to collapse. After hearing the news, Chen, who was in Shanghai, rushed back to Xiyi from Hankou and surrendered himself. The County Government opened a court yesterday to detain Chen, who wanted to open a silk factory, to investigate.</p>
<p>The Overwhelming Cost of the Xin Cheng Road Repair Project: The southern section of the Xin Cheng Road, which began construction on April 3rd of last year, was not open to traffic until the ceremony held on August 20th of this year. Public long-distance buses travel. However, the roadbed from Tangtou to Yanqiao is not high and the soil is loose, making it dangerous for heavy vehicles to travel. Therefore, it was once suspended. Director Yao Dixi, of the Construction Bureau, recognized this difficulty and wanted to repair it, but the cost was enormous. The income from the toll fees, etc., must be remitted to the province, and cannot be retained in Wuxi for subsidies. However, the purchase of a large soil compactor requires about 10,000 yuan, plus the cost of coal dust and labor, for a total of more than 10,000 yuan. The bureau has no money. In order to complete the entire road, he took a car to the province on the morning of the 10th to ask Director Sun of the Construction Department for instructions on how to do it.</p>

<p>Rampant Banditry in Baoyan in the Southern Countryside: Baoyan Town in the southern countryside of Zhenjiang, located at the intersection of Danyang, Jurong, and Zhenjiang, has flourishing commerce and prosperous residents. Jin Futian and Zhao Jinzhang, the first and second squadron leaders of the county police team, command two teams of soldiers stationed in the town to provide security. On the 7th of this month, the two teams were ordered to join the Baoyan Chamber of Commerce to suppress bandits in Baitou, more than ten miles away from the Zhenjiang Jurong border. It is reported that the bandits totaled about 300 people, secretly lurking in the Gaoli Mountain area of Jurong, were subordinates of Ma Yuren, were fully armed, and carried some kind of reactionary flag. The march set off at 9:00 AM. The police and militia numbered about 100. Unexpectedly, the police team encountered the bandits on the road in Xuxiang Village (three miles from Baitou). The police team panicked and fled, firing random shots into the sky along the way and discarding a large number of bullets along the way, as if they were resupplying the bandits. The residents of Xuxiang Village, seeing this, were terrified and fled with their families, their cries echoing through the fields. The militia, which fought valiantly in the front line, was eventually defeated due to the disparity in numbers. Five militiamen were injured in the battle, one died, and one was kidnapped. After seeing the police team retreat, the bandits acted with impunity, burning more than 1,000 houses in Baitou Town, Luxi, Dingjiayang, and other villages within a few miles, kidnapping dozens of residents, and injuring dozens of people. By noon at about 12:00, the entire police team had retreated to Baoyan, but not a single bullet remained. The merchants and residents of the town immediately gathered with Xie, the district chief of the Sixth District, to discuss plans for self-preservation. They planned to invite the two captains, Jin and Zhao, to attend, but all the captains and police had disappeared. The merchants and residents were both afraid and angry at the situation, and local order was almost disrupted. Fortunately, Zhang Guoquan, the deputy commander of the Self-Defense Corps, led more than 50 militiamen to join the Chamber of Commerce for defense and temporary relief. A representative was sent to the province to appeal for help, and Battalion Commander Wang of the Third Battalion of the Thirty-first Regiment of the Seventeenth Brigade of the Sixth Division led a team to suppress the bandits overnight and has now arrived at the town.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications' Reply Regarding Opposition to Telephone Rate Increases: Because telephone rates in Yangzhou have been repeatedly increased, telephone subscribers believe it is unacceptable. Therefore, they unanimously opposed the Ministry of Communications' order to increase the rate by one yuan. The Chamber of Commerce then requested the Ministry of Communications to withdraw the order. The Chamber has now received a reply, stating that the order to slightly increase the telephone rent in each telephone bureau is intended to seek the survival of the telephone business and to gradually reorganize it. It is hoped that you will understand the difficulties of the times and inform the business community to comply. The request to cancel the monthly rent increase and refund the registration fee cannot be approved. It is hoped that you will comply, etc. It is now reported that the subscribers intend to take a second step to resist, but it is still unknown whether it will be effective.</p>

<p>Endeavoring to Serve as Usual, Hoping All Colleagues</p>
<p>Will Strive to Handle Matters Expeditiously and Conclude the Education Department's Memorial Week in Front of Sun Yat-sen at 8:30 AM the Day Before Yesterday, Commissioner Chen Braved Illness to Arrive at the Office, Leading All Staff to Attend, Performing the Ceremony as Usual. His political report, in addition to outlining military and political matters, also briefly mentioned his personal resignation, stating: "My physical health has always been weak, and I suffer from heart disease. I have repeatedly wanted to retire to recuperate. In the past two months, various illnesses have arisen, and my condition has worsened. Last week, my teeth and gums swelled and ached, preventing me from sleeping at night. Medical diagnoses all indicate that unless I completely withdraw from everything and have at least six months of absolute rest, my illness will become incurable. Under these circumstances, if I continue to force myself to work, my illness will inevitably hinder my duties, which would be detrimental to both the public and private spheres. While we serve the Party and the nation, we should not consider personal interests, but we should also only take on duties that our bodies can handle without hindering our work. Otherwise, the crime of neglecting public duties cannot be avoided. Therefore, I have already submitted my resignation from all my concurrent positions to the provincial government and the central government some days ago. Although I have not yet received approval from the central government, my physical condition is such that my desire to leave is extremely urgent. I will do everything I can to seek understanding from all parties to fulfill my initial desire to recuperate. During this waiting period, I must come to the office despite my illness due to my responsibilities. My colleagues have worked together for more than a year, and they should understand the difference between an individual and an organization. We are here to serve education and to serve Zhejiang. Do not allow my words to cause any slackening in your work. You should continue to be proactive and responsible as usual. For all matters handled by each person, strive for speed. Any accumulated items should be cleared quickly. Always be prepared to conclude matters at any time. This is what I have often cautioned in the past. The difference between a new organization and an old government office lies in this. I may need to reduce my time in the office due to my health. I hope that all colleagues will always encourage each other with what I have said today."</p>

<p>For Compiling Supplementary Readers for Lower Grades of Elementary School</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau previously submitted to the Ministry of Education that, in order for elementary school children to understand the significance of National Revolution Commemorative holidays, they should be provided with supplementary readers. In the past, such teaching materials were temporarily selected by the class teachers of each school, and it goes without saying that the ideas could not be consistent and the content could not be appropriate. Recognizing this, the bureau specifically assigned personnel to compile ten types of supplementary readers for the revolutionary commemorative holidays suitable for elementary school children in the lower grades, which were divided into ten volumes and are planned to be released soon. The original text is hereby submitted for inspection and approval, and instructions should be issued swiftly for compliance. The Ministry of Education recently instructed the bureau: "The submitted documents and attachments have been fully received and understood. All the submitted books have now been reviewed and completed by the Ministry. The review shows that the content and materials are adapted to the needs of children and the illustrations are precise. It is evident that the bureau knows how to make efforts and research in guiding the work of schools, which is deeply commendable. However, there are still some inappropriate words in the books. You should revise them according to the comments before being allowed to publish them and use them as supplementary readers for children in the lower grades of elementary schools. You may also publish the words 'Approved for publication after review by the Ministry of Education' on the books. When the books are printed, the format should be suitable for children's psychology, and the illustrations should be reproduced without distortion. Two copies of the published books should be sent to the Ministry for record. Furthermore, supplementary readers for elementary schools have a great function in teaching and have the same value as textbooks. Although there are many published ones on the market, there are still not many suitable ones. During the period of the provisional standards for elementary school curriculum, each school should use the practical experiment results to compile reading materials. There should also be no lack of good books. You should immediately transfer the order to the schools under your jurisdiction to collect them at any time, and submit them to the bureau for detailed review before selecting the best ones to be sent to the Ministry for review and reply for compliance."</p>

All plans have long been prepared by the department, so it is only necessary to set a suitable time to hold the citywide service personnel election meeting to establish the council. Before the election, the Municipal Training Department will review the list of service personnel in Shanghai, publish it in the newspaper, and determine the election qualifications (new members must report their departure or arrival to the Municipal Training Department). At the same time, it will report to the Chinese Boy Scout Headquarters to schedule an election and request them to send personnel to Shanghai with ballots to supervise the election to show caution. The election date has been roughly set by the department and reported to the headquarters. The total number of service personnel in Shanghai is being reviewed and counted in detail.</p>
<p>Also, the Boy Scout Troop of the Shanghai Middle School Experimental Elementary School in this city previously registered with the headquarters and has now been reviewed and approved, and has been designated as the 230th Troop, and Gu Zhenguang has been commissioned as the troop leader.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Saying a Word for the South-Bound Football Teams: Hu Wenhu <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Teams Must Cooperate... Hosted by the National Sports Advancement Association</p>
<p>(August 30th, Singapore Correspondence) In the recent two months, well-known domestic football teams, such as the China Expedition Football Team, South China, and China have come to Singapore one after another. The overseas Chinese, out of patriotic ideals, have warmly welcomed them, and Mr. Hu Wenhu, the owner of Yong An Tang in Singapore, has done his best as the host. Mr. Hu's enthusiasm for promoting sports is rare both at home and abroad. However, Mr. Hu, in view of the fact that the visiting teams cannot concentrate talents, resulting in their strength not being strong enough, deeply regrets this and has written "Saying a Word for the South-Bound Football Teams" to advise the teams and hope that the National Sports Advancement Association will rise up to host the event, which will have a multiplier effect. The original text of Mr. Hu is recorded below: "This time, the South China, Lehua (i.e., China Expedition Football Team), and China football teams have come to the south one after another. The team members themselves have gained the benefit of observing artistic soil, and the South China sports community has been given an intangible incentive to promote it. Most of our fathers and brothers have also been able to enjoy the limited blessing of appreciating the artistic performances of the athletes, which is a great event. However, although the skills of the three teams of athletes are generally good, the advantages of offense and defense must have their own strengths and weaknesses, and they are not perfect. Therefore, they win often, but sometimes they are inevitably calculated by the opposing team, which is a pity. A football team on an expedition to a foreign country, under the gaze of China and foreign countries, although the way to win or lose is small, the glory of the national system is at stake. We firmly believe that combining the athletes of the three Hua teams into a strong team will not only run rampant in the South China Sea, but can also be invincible and unconquerable. Even on an expedition to Europe and the United States, competing with the blue-eyed and purple-bearded people, they may not give way much. However, their forces are weak when divided. Team A is good at attacking, but the rear is empty. When enemy soldiers knock on the door, they open the door and invite thieves. Team B has a strong defense, but the front line is too weak. Those who cannot fight are not easy to defend. The attack and defense of the two teams have their own strengths, but the whole team occasionally has weaknesses. Sometimes, moving one hair will move the whole body. On the day of the ball war, the army is not harmonious. The whole audience is silent and drooping. The spectators on the wall feel the same way. Each team of athletes, being in the game, must have the feeling of after the fierce feeling."</p>
<p>"I think that in the future, football teams should be hosted by the National Sports Association when going on expeditions. Select the elite to form an iron army. An expedition to the South China Sea, once a year, will see the division to where it is, destroying the rotten and breaking the pine, raising the prestige of the Han people and snowing the nickname of the sick man. The glory of the sports world is also the happiness of all the overseas Chinese."</p>
<p>"Some say that each team has its own history of organization, and the separation of ways is different, and cooperation is difficult. I don't know that things are divided into private and public, internal and external, and the boundaries should be strict. Moreover, sports is a noble industry, and athletes should have a broad and great spirit. How can we misrepresent meaningless prejudices and create divisions to hinder the development of the sports industry and affect the glory of the national system? I hope that the athletes of the three teams will think about it carefully."</p>

<p>—Resolution of the Shanghai Chinese Sports Referees Association—</p>
<p>—Electing Committee Members to Register with the Ministry of Education—</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Sports Referees Association held its first monthly meeting after the summer vacation at 7 PM last night at the Huibin Building. 19 members attended. Xu Zhendong chaired the meeting, and Le Xiurong recorded the minutes. The matters resolved are as follows: (1) Secretary Song Junfu has taken a teaching position at Northeastern University and has requested to resign. Approved. Jiang Xiangqing was elected to succeed him. (2) Vice President Wu Bangwei has taken the position of Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Sports Stadium and will no longer be able to serve in Shanghai. He requested to resign. Approved. Zhang Guoxun was elected to succeed him. (3) The Shanghai Standard Sports Equipment Company sent a letter requesting to send personnel to review its products. It was resolved not to discuss it and handed over to the China National Sports Advancement Association for handling. (4) This association is an independent agency and should prepare a document to apply for registration with the Ministry of Education. Xu Zhendong, Jiang Xiangqing, and Tang Zhongguang were elected as committee members to be responsible for the process. (5) Chen Fuzhang was approved as a basketball group member, and a basketball referee badge was reissued to Zhen. (6) Jiang Xiangqing proposed that refereeing competitions, which have always used English, is an extremely shameful and illogical matter. It can also be said to be a sign of self-recognition as a weak nation. The people of strong countries never ignore the language and culture of their countries, while the people of weak nations can often speak several fluent languages. The last Far Eastern Games were held in Tokyo, and the referees all used Japanese. Although the Chinese athletes were all confused, they could not do anything about it. Now, Chinese people are competing with Chinese people, but they use a non-national language to referee, which is too inconsistent. Strictly speaking, even if Chinese people compete with foreigners, Chinese should be used to referee, because foreigners in China should learn Chinese and accommodate the Chinese, and should not reverse the situation and have the Chinese accommodate foreigners. Therefore, Mandarin should be used for refereeing in the future to maintain the spirit of our independent country. Passed. Le Xiurong, Jiang Xiangqing, Shu Hong, Zhang Guoxun, and others were elected as committee members to first formulate the terms for football and basketball, and then submit them for revision. After the revision, they will be unified and published in the newspaper. (7) The president designated Le Xiurong, Jiang Xiangqing, and Xu Zhendong as a group of committee members, and designated Zhang Guoxun, Shu Hong, and Xu as a group of committee members.</p>

<h3 id="e109">China National Aviation Corporation to Conduct Test Flight to Chongqing Tomorrow Morning <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Official Flights Scheduled to Begin Early Next Month</p>
<p>According to a new contract signed on July 1st, China National Aviation Corporation was reorganized and merged with the existing Shanghai-Chengdu Aviation Corporation to become a commercial aviation transport company. China National Aviation Corporation originally had four aircraft, all of the Loening type. Shanghai-Chengdu Aviation Corporation initially had nine aircraft, all of the Stinson type, but two were later transferred to the General Headquarters, and three more were borrowed. Therefore, when merged with China National Aviation Corporation, only three remained. China National Aviation Corporation recently ordered another Loening amphibious aircraft from the United States, which will arrive in Shanghai on the 19th of this month. The company's Shanghai-Hankou air transport service has been running for nearly a year, and its success in mail delivery and passenger transport is widely known. Recently, the company has been actively expanding its routes to the interior of Sichuan. A plane has been scheduled to fly to Chongqing for a test flight tomorrow morning, along with a survey of the Yangtze River. It has also been decided to start official flights early next month. The flight from Shanghai to Hankou will take seven hours, with an overnight stay in Hankou. From Hankou to Chongqing, it will take eight hours. Thus, a journey from Shanghai to Chongqing, which previously took no less than two weeks, can now be completed in two days, greatly benefiting merchants and travelers. This also marks a significant achievement in China's aviation transportation industry.</p>
<p>Preparations The company has already sent personnel to Yichang and Chongqing to prepare for the extended routes, including liaising with local authorities, installing buoys on the river surface, arranging fuel supplies, and weather reports. All preparations have been completed. Several wireless radio sets have been shipped from Shanghai for installation at various stops. The existing Shanghai-Hankou route uses American Loening amphibious aircraft, as they can land on the river at any time, making them the most reliable aircraft for the Yangtze River route. However, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have steep mountains and turbulent rapids. The first test flight is expected to be challenging. However, the company is using the latest amphibious aircraft, which can land on both land and water when necessary, mitigating potential dangers. The test flight from Shanghai to Chongqing is scheduled for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. The plane will stay overnight in Hankou, then proceed to Yichang the next day, Wanzhou the third day, and arrive in Chongqing on the fourth day, allowing for detailed surveying of the terrain and arrangement of parking facilities. The return journey will be a direct flight from Chongqing back to Hankou for an overnight stay, and then back to Shanghai the next day. The total distance from Shanghai to Chongqing is over 1,200 miles, requiring only twelve hours of non-stop flying. After the successful test flight, official flights will begin within a month, with stops planned in Yichang and Wanzhou to load and unload mail and passengers. The new aircraft arriving on the 19th of this month will be used for flights between Hankou and Chongqing. Initially, there will be only one flight per week between Hankou and Chongqing. After the official flight between Shanghai and Chongqing is successful, plans will continue to extend the route to Chengdu. The test flight will be piloted by the company's Chief and Deputy Chief of Aviation, American Mr. Smith and Mr. Nie Kaiyi. Mr. Smith has many years of flying experience in the United States. Mr. Nie is a graduate of an American aviation school and has many years of experience in the Chinese aviation industry. He was also involved in the establishment of Shanghai-Chengdu Aviation Corporation under the Ministry of Communications. The company's Vice Chairman, Mr. Hamilton, will also be on board.</p>

<h3 id="e111">White Russians Forcibly Demolish Civilian Houses in Qingyun Lane, Chongming Road Yesterday <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Over Thirty Homes Disturbed</p>
<p>Several Citizens Injured</p>
<p>Citizens' United Conference Resolves to Provide Assistance The houses in the Qingyun Lane area of North Sichuan Road and Chongming Road belong to the property of New Sassoon &amp; Co. Recently, due to the issue of reconstruction and renovation, disputes have arisen between the owners and tenants for two months. Around 10:00 AM yesterday, over two hundred White Russians arrived in eight trucks and began demolishing houses in Qingyun Lane, starting from Qifa Grocery Store at No. 14 Chongming Road. Residents were shocked and alarmed by the sudden arrival of the White Russian workers, who entered their homes without warning. They gathered to resist, and conflicts broke out. Some were wrestling and fighting, while others were throwing tiles and bricks. Several people were injured. After the incident, the residents reported to the Hongkou Police Station, which immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to suppress the violence and ordered the Russians to stop working and await a resolution. By 11:30 AM, this theatrical scene of demolition had come to a halt.</p>
<p>Demolition in Progress Qingyun Lane consists of nine lanes, with Chongming Road as the latitude, connecting Tian Road in the south and Wuchang Road in the north. There are many residents, with no fewer than five hundred households, including storefronts. The owner, New Sassoon &amp; Co., recently proposed reconstruction, but the residents opposed it. The Tenants' Association has been negotiating with the company without success. The owner has given the tenants until the end of August to vacate the premises for demolition and plans to start demolishing over a hundred houses in lanes six to nine and along the street front. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, the owner ordered over two hundred White Russian workers to demolish the houses.</p>
<p>Conflict Erupts The Russian workers arrived in a fleet of eight trucks. Upon reaching their destination, they got out and entered the house of Qifa Grocery Store at No. 14. Initially, the residents were puzzled by the arrival of the large group of Russians. However, after learning the reason, they were greatly displeased. The employees of Qifa Grocery Store were shocked to see the Russians entering their house and tried to stop them, but they refused. As they did not speak the same language, a conflict broke out immediately. Those on the roof threw bricks and tiles, while those below punched and fought back. The area around Chongming Road was thrown into chaos, and the residents panicked.</p>
<p>The residents reported the situation to the Hongkou Police Station and requested assistance. The Police Chief led a team of armed Chinese and Western detectives to suppress the violence. However, by the time they arrived, several people had already been injured in the fighting.</p>
<p>Work Suspended When the police arrived, the Hongkou Fire Brigade also drove to the scene. However, as there was no fire, they quickly withdrew. The Police Chief first summoned five Russian foremen and ordered them to suspend work and await a resolution. The Russians then descended from the houses, and by around 11:30 AM, they had gradually left. By then, the roofs of over thirty houses had been damaged. Several people from both sides were injured in the chaos. Among the tenants, Miao She Lai, Ye Jingming, and Deng Tong were injured, with Miao's injuries being the most severe. There were also several cases of theft of silver dollars and clothing. The Tenants' Association held an emergency meeting overnight to discuss countermeasures and request assistance from various organizations.</p>
<p>Citizens' Meeting The Preparatory Committee of the Special District Citizens' United Conference held its ninth plenary committee meeting yesterday afternoon. Nineteen committee members, including She Yangsheng, Lu Qisheng, Jiang Xinzhao, and Wang Pingnan, attended. Chen Yiting was elected as the chairman.

<h3 id="e112">Rickshaw Rent Hike <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Heard Resolved Last Night</p>
<p>Resumption of Work Expected This Morning Around 2:00 PM yesterday, near the intersection of Route Tenant de la Tour and Avenue Joffre in the French Concession (where many rickshaws are rented out), some rickshaw owners wanted to increase the rent by one jiao per shift. The rickshaw pullers could not afford it, so they started a strike. Immediately, some rickshaw pullers deflated the tires of passing rickshaws, regardless of whether they had passengers, and ordered them to return the rickshaws, joining the strike. The information gathered is detailed below: (Reason) The license fees have not increased, but the major companies are increasing the rent again. Even if the major companies do not increase the rent, the small owners (those who subcontract the rickshaws) want to increase the rent by one jiao per shift, making it unaffordable for the rickshaw pullers, leading to the strike. (Rent) The major companies rent out the rickshaws for seven or eight jiao per shift. After being subcontracted several times, the small owners rent them out for one yuan per shift. Now, they want to increase it by another jiao, adding to the cost of straw sandals, lamp oil, fines, and other expenses, making it unbearable for the rickshaw pullers. (Order) According to the striking rickshaw pullers, the rent increase was not approved by the authorities, so the police did not interfere with the strike. However, some agitators (those who deflated the tires) were arrested by the Public Security Bureau near Tangjiawan. It was also reported that the Public Security Bureau believed that the number of striking rickshaw pullers was too large and unorganized, consisting of simple-minded and mixed-quality individuals who could easily be incited, posing a significant threat to social order. Therefore, upon learning of the strike, they immediately dispatched a large team of armed police officers to maintain order. (Aftermath) The rickshaw manager hired by a small owner in Dakang Lane on Route Tenant de la Tour, who usually bullies the rickshaw pullers, continued to do so during the strike. This angered the striking rickshaw pullers. Four or five women from the same lane, feeling indignant, led the way and beat him severely in retaliation for his usual bullying. (Arrests and Releases) When the commotion occurred, the police were alerted and immediately dispatched detectives to stop it. Twenty-two people were arrested on the spot and taken to the police station. After a detailed inquiry, the police determined that they were all rickshaw pullers and feared that unscrupulous individuals were inciting them. After giving them a lecture, they were immediately released. (Resolution) It was reported that the price increase was notified by the rickshaw owners to the small owners on the first of this month, with implementation scheduled for the seventh. However, some parties voluntarily compromised and reduced the increase to five fen. As the rickshaw owners are not a unified organization, the implementation varied, leading to a sudden small disturbance yesterday. As of last night, the issue has been completely resolved, with a uniform reduction to five fen. If there are no other changes, business will resume as usual today.</p>

<h3 id="e114">San De Tang and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Correspondences <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Agreed to Renew Lease or Purchase Wharf</p>
<p>But Wording Still Evasive</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Declares Extension for Arbitration In the Jinliyuan Wharf case of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, after both parties appointed arbitrators, the French arbitrator, Yamina, acted entirely as an arbitrator for the annulment of the contract, and everything was restrained by the French Court, violating the provisions of the arbitration agreement. Fortunately, the French Consul-General, Kammerer, sincerely mediated, preventing a complete breakdown. Now, the representative of San De Tang has sent a letter to the lawyer of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Tietbeck, agreeing to renew the lease or purchase the wharf. However, it was verbally stated that the French Bishop had left Paris for the countryside, and the price had not yet been estimated, and negotiations had not begun. The General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Cai, has notified the French Court and San De Tang of the statement. The various news items are detailed below:</p>
<p>French Consul-General's Sincere Expression The French Consul-General telegraphed Lawyer Gao Shuo yesterday morning to discuss the San De Tang case and promised to wait for a reply from Paris and persuade the priest to settle peacefully as soon as possible. The communication was very satisfactory.</p>
<p>San De Tang's Letter to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company "Letter from Lawyer Barreau, Representative of San De Tang, to Lawyer Tietbeck, Representative of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company," (Translation) Sir, in the case of the San De Tang and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company lease dispute, on the 19th of this month, the French Concession Mixed Court ruled to give China Merchants Steam Navigation Company a final deadline of September 15th of this year to select an arbitrator as stipulated in the first instance judgment of January 7th of this year and the appellate judgment of May 23rd. On the same day, our client received a letter from the General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company stating that they had selected Lawyer Gao Shuo as their full representative. However, the letter stated that the French Consul had taken steps to prevent the execution of the judgment, which is quite alarming. Lawyer Gao Shuo subsequently visited Yamina, the arbitrator of San De Tang, but according to Lawyer Gao, the scope of arbitration was not limited to that stipulated in the two judgments and insisted on re-arbitrating the entire case. Yamina stated that this was not possible and informed him that his arbitration report had already been submitted to the court. Lawyer Gao could either follow his report or submit his own opinion. If they disagreed, the two arbitrators would jointly appoint a third arbitrator, or the court would appoint Yamina to review his report. However, today's newspapers reported that the above situation, based on a semi-official telegram from Nanjing, was completely inconsistent with the facts and was a threatening propaganda. Although the French Consul had mediated during the dispute to persuade the two parties to continue amicable negotiations, if the negotiations broke down, the judgment of the French Court would still be executed. The French Consul has no intention of interfering with justice and has no such power. As a result of the French Consul's mediation, there are two options: (1) On the 26th of this month, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent a letter to the French Consul stating that they had obtained the consent of the Ningpo Commercial &amp; Savings Bank to guarantee the payment of future rent and requested the French Consul to instruct San De Tang to begin arbitration as soon as possible; (2) San De Tang telegraphed its headquarters in Paris to seek agreement to sell the X-shaped base and wharf at No. 69 to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. This method is most appropriate and will permanently avoid future disputes. San De Tang hereby explains its position in four points: (1) The cancellation of the lease is a confirmed fact. If the two parties cannot reach an agreement within a very short period of time, the judgment should be executed according to the court's instructions. The arbitrator's task is only to verify the details of the execution and cannot exceed the scope set by the court order to negotiate new contracts or other methods. However, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can still fully authorize its lawyer or other representatives to directly negotiate with the San De Tang priest to reach an agreement, negotiate a new contract, or purchase the wharf to permanently resolve the current dispute and avoid future disputes; (2) Before the agreement is reached, the arbitration must still proceed as usual and must be completed by September 15th at the latest. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's arbitrator, Lawyer Gao, should submit the arbitration report as soon as possible so that a third arbitrator can be selected to resolve any disagreements between the two arbitrators; (3) China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has not paid our client the rent for this term. All rent collected from this year onwards and the rent payable after the judgment before China Merchants Steam Navigation Company vacates are due. However, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company cannot use this as an excuse to hope to restore the lease that has already been cancelled. This should be clearly stated; (4) The bank guarantee provided by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should be issued by the guarantor, specifying the guarantor's obligations. Although China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has resorted to despicable methods, there is still a possibility of reconciliation between the two parties. Please inform your client to engage in substantive negotiations and not to use newspaper propaganda as a tool, which may lead to reconciliation. Sincerely, Lawyer Tietbeck, Barreau, August 1930.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Letter to San De Tang "Letter from General Manager Cai Peiji of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company directly to the French Court's San De Tang, refuting the letter from Lawyer Barreau's representative," issued yesterday, stated that the delay was the responsibility of San De Tang. According to the report of Lawyer Gao Shuo, the arbitrator of the company, (1) Yamina, the arbitrator of the other party, expressed his views and sent a letter to Lawyer Gao, which took four days; (2) Bishop Xia Lou telegraphed the headquarters in Paris to inquire about the sale price, but has not yet received a reply. If all the issues are discussed individually, it will take several months to resolve them. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is willing to sincerely accept the French Consul-General's kind mediation and resolve everything as soon as possible. September 15th is the deadline set by the court, and the two parties must request a postponement. Finally, it was said that San De Tang is a charitable organization of the church, and the two parties, as landlord and tenant, have a considerable amount of affection for each other. It is hoped that they will be open and honest with each other and resolve the matter as soon as possible to maintain friendship and live up to the French Consul-General's efforts to mediate.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Li Zhonggong to Take Over China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Soon <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Officially Takes Office on the 13th of This Month</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to be Managed by Government under Commercial Operation</p>
<p>Li Zhonggong, the new General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, has been in Shanghai for many days. Recently, Mr. Li has been busy contacting various parties, and the date of his assumption of office has been determined. The reporter specially asked Acting General Manager Cai Ziping yesterday and was informed of Mr. Li's assumption date, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Date of Mr. Li's Assumption According to Mr. Cai, he has met with General Manager Li many times. Because he has finished contacting various parties, it has been confirmed that he will officially take over the affairs of the company this Saturday (the 13th). The transfer of affairs in the bureau has been completed, waiting for Mr. Li to take over. Mr. Cai also said that he and Mr. Li have a subordinate relationship, so he must wait until he takes office before he can leave Shanghai to go to Beijing.</p>
<p>Policy Determined for Bureau Affairs This time, Li Zhonggong went to Beijing to discuss the progress of reorganizing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company with various ministries and departments related to the central government. The most important thing is the future direction of the bureau, whether it is state-owned, commercially operated, or jointly operated by the government and business. The results of the discussion in Beijing have, in fact, been determined. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will remain a commercial enterprise, but the government will send personnel to manage it on its behalf to facilitate reorganization. Mr. Li's assumption of office as General Manager in Shanghai this time is still based on this national exercise of reorganization power as the direction of progress.</p>
<p>Another Report The New Sound News Agency reported that Mr. Li Zhonggong, the new General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, has arrived in Shanghai for many days and has generally prepared everything and can go to the bureau to take charge. However, the State Council decided to follow the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee to formulate the Provisional Regulations of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, change the organization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and establish a Reorganization Committee as a deliberative body and appoint a commissioner as an executive body. Mr. Li sent a letter to the National Government yesterday. If the State Council can pass it this week and the members of the Reorganization Committee are selected, Mr. Li intends to wait until the official announcement before taking office next Monday (the 15th) to avoid further changes. If this is not possible in fact, it is said that it has been decided to go to the bureau to take charge tomorrow (the 12th). A reporter from the New Sound News Agency inquired from the authorities about the members of the Reorganization Committee. It is said that Chen Guofu, Wang Boqun, Li Zhonggong, Yu Qiaqing, and Ye Zuotang have been internally determined as five members. It is said that Cai Peiji, the current general manager, because he was originally the Director of the Navigation Administration Department, is related to the scope of navigation administration. Liu Hongsheng, a major merchant in Shanghai, is heavily relied upon by Chairman Jiang, and a telegram has been sent to Beijing to recommend him. It is said that he will be selected. Also, Mr. Yu Qiaqing clearly expressed to reporters yesterday that whether he will take up the position of Reorganization Committee member of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company depends on whether the committee can exercise its reorganization powers and whether there are practical methods.</p>
<h3 id="e116">High Court Yesterday Heard童三毛's Appeal Case <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Conspired Suicide, Rescued and Saved</p>
<p>According to the Law, He Should Be Exempted from Punishment</p>
<p>童's Lawyer Made This Request</p>
<p>The Court Ordered the Verdict to Be Announced on the 15th. The case of 童三毛 from Ningbo, who coerced the dancing girl 黃白英 to take poison, but she was rescued and survived, once caused a sensation. 童 was prosecuted by the police for attempted instigation of murder in the Special District Local Court and sentenced to two years of imprisonment. Dissatisfied, he appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, which scheduled the trial for September 10, as previously reported. Yesterday afternoon, the appointed date arrived, and the police escorted 童 to the First Criminal Court of the High Court Branch. 童 wore a sticky colored Western suit, a pale blue shirt, and a straw hat. Although he had been detained for over two months, he did not appear to be in a state of decline. After the trial began, 童 held his hat in his hand. However, 黃白英 had gone to Hong Kong and was therefore unable to appear in court. Judge 宋沅, assessors 高君湘 and 葉在疇, as well as the prosecutor and clerk, took their seats. First, three other cases involving the promotion of doctrines incompatible with the Three Principles of the People were judged. Then, the 童 case was addressed. Judge 宋 asked 童 his age, place of origin, address, and profession. He then ordered him to give a detailed account of the case's process and the grounds for his appeal. 童 then recounted everything from his acquaintance with 黃白英 to the events after she took poison, her admission to 寳隆 Hospital for treatment, and the circumstances under which the police dispatched detectives to investigate the hospital and arrest him. His statements were entirely consistent with his testimony in the first instance trial, without any discrepancies, so there was no need to elaborate. Next, the witnesses were called, including 方衡年, who had ridden with 童三毛 and 黃白英 in a car on the night of June 28 from outside the Paris Dance Hall to the western suburbs of Shanghai, as well as the driver and the tea server from Room 101 of the Cangzhou Hotel. They were interrogated in turn. After each person gave a detailed account of what they knew, Judge 宋 ordered the start of the debate. 童's defense lawyer stated that the most important witness in the case, 黃白英, was absent. He asked whether it would be possible to summon her to court for interrogation before proceeding with the debate. The judge replied that the police were handling the matter concerning 黃白英, so it was not necessary for her to be present in person. The lawyer then defended his client, 童三毛. He first analyzed the facts, stating that 童's actions that night were insufficient to prove any intention to instigate suicide. He also attacked 黃白英's testimony during the first trial. Next, he discussed the law, saying that it did not constitute the crime of instigating suicide but rather a form of conspired suicide, rescued and saved, for which, according to the law, he should be exempted from punishment or granted a suspended sentence. Finally, he stated that the reason 黃白英 accused 童 was that she had been misled by her new lover, surnamed Zhang. 黃 initially wanted to die with 童, but after being rescued, she testified in court that 童 had coerced her to take poison, which was the result of her ingratiating herself with Zhang. As for 童's statement today that the pills were poured onto the table at the time and, in the blink of an eye, not only were all the pills gone, but even the bottle containing the pills had disappeared, 黃 actually did not swallow them, etc. If this were indeed the case, then it would be similar to the actions of a prostitute treating a patron in the past. In the past, prostitutes would always cut their hair to show their love when their patrons were about to leave. Dancing girls are only one step away from prostitutes, so it is difficult to guarantee that she did not agree to take poison on one hand while taking the opportunity to discard the pills on the other. Next, police lawyer 厲志山 argued, saying that the appellant believed that 黃白英 was not present today and there was no one to confront, but the transcripts of the first trial were all available and could be used to evade responsibility. The elements of the crime of instigating suicide are that another person has suicidal intent and only makes the decision after being instigated. The appellant's instigation of suicide involved all means of enticement, intimidation, deception, and assistance. 黃's motive for suicide stemmed from wanting to marry someone surnamed Zhang, but the appellant threatened her, saying that there would be a danger to the lives of two or more people. 黃 was afraid that there would be an accident after the marriage. Although Zhang wanted to marry her, 黃 was unwilling to be a concubine because he already had a wife. She was in a dilemma and had the idea of suicide. 童 then bought the pills for her and expressed his desire to die together. After 黃 took the pills, he took care of himself alone. Isn't this enticement, intimidation, deception, and assistance? If 童 had a sincere intention to commit suicide together, even if the pills had been taken completely, he could have either jumped into the sea or shot himself. 黃白英 is not present today, and the details cannot be fully known, but it is not difficult to imagine from the fact that 童's family made a special trip to the 黃 family during the first trial. Therefore, the appellant cannot overturn all the testimony in this case. The sentence of two years' imprisonment in the first trial was already extremely lenient. At the time, the police thought that 童 was young and that two years of imprisonment might reform him. He requested that the original verdict be upheld and rejected his request for a suspended sentence, let alone an exemption from punishment. 童's lawyer then offered another rebuttal before the conclusion was announced. The court ordered that the verdict be announced at 2:00 PM on the 15th of this month. 童三毛 was still taken back to the police station for detention by the police. The time was exactly 5:30.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Polish Youth Innocent <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Possessing a Handgun, Fined 400 Yuan. Polish youth Adam 士西士勞 was previously accused by dancing girl 李桂芬 from the 爵祿 Dance Hall of being lured to the fourth floor of 9 1/2 Hankou Road, where he used a handgun to threaten rape. The police went to search and found a handgun, detaining the Polish man and sending him to the Special District Local Court. Unexpectedly, during the second hearing, the plaintiff suddenly failed to appear and left a letter saying that she had left Shanghai and that they had only had a verbal argument and she had not been raped. Judge Zhou then approved the defendant's release on bail pending judgment, as detailed in previous reports. Yesterday morning was the date for the pronouncement of the verdict. The defendant arrived with his lawyer. Judge Zhou then took his seat and sentenced the defendant to a fine of 400 yuan for the crime of possessing a military handgun without permission. If the fine was not paid after compulsory enforcement, he would be allowed to commute the sentence to one day of imprisonment for every two yuan. The handgun was confiscated, and he was found not guilty of the alleged rape.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Kidnapping Case in 陳家行 and 邢家堰, Pudong <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The area of 邢家堰 in Tangkou South River, Chenxing Township, Pudong, has always been peaceful. The residents are mostly engaged in farming and are simple and have ancient customs. Unexpectedly, a kidnapping case occurred the day before yesterday. Initially, there was a person named 邢吟泉 in the area who made a living by farming and had a small ancestral estate. He had a grown son. That night, he was at home. A month ago, he had received several anonymous letters demanding a large sum of money, with the general meaning, "If you don't reply, it shows that you have no sincerity in negotiating. If that is the case, then we will take action. We ask you to pay special attention," etc. He ignored them all, which angered the bandits. It had not been a day or two. The house next to 吟泉 was occupied by his nephew. That night at 11:00 PM, six bandits knocked on the door of 邢's nephew's house. Amidst the commotion, they mistakenly bound and kidnapped 邢尧生 (25 years old), 吟泉's nephew, and 尧生's younger brother. At the time, 吟泉 heard the noise and knew it was bandits. He did not dare to go out to investigate, so he took his son to the roof to avoid them and fortunately escaped unharmed. Later, he saw the bandits holding weapons and heading southwest along the official road leading directly to Dujiahang Town in the moonlight. He waited to report to the Chenxing Town Public Security Bureau and the Security Corps and requested them to pursue the bandits, but they had already disappeared without a trace. According to 吟泉, the bandits seemed to be former water patrolmen who spoke fluent Northern dialect and wore dark gray clothes.</p>

<p>吳德忠, a native of Yancheng, 28 years old, made a living pulling rickshaws and selling soy milk. He currently lived with his aunt, 吳唐氏 (44 years old), at 9 Fuxing Lane, Xinqiao Road, Nanshi. 吳's wife, 高氏, was the same age as 吳. The couple had a close relationship and had two sons. The eldest, 大祥子, was 7 years old, and the younger, 小祥子, was only 3 years old. The hall at number 9 was rented by 唐茂相, a tutor, who ran a private school with more than 30 students, mostly children of laborers. The tuition he received was barely enough to make ends meet. 吳 had a cousin named 德隆 who was also a rickshaw puller. He lived in the French Concession at the home of his uncle, 吳祥生, in 公記 Lane. Yesterday afternoon around 5:00 PM, 德隆 suddenly gathered a group of hooligans and went directly to 9 Fuxing Lane. He called 唐茂相 to a nearby teahouse to talk. 唐 had just dismissed school, so he went with them to the teahouse. Unexpectedly, 德隆 told 唐 that 唐 was having an affair with 德忠's wife. He was aggressive and intended to extort money. 唐 sternly refused. 德隆 became angry and went to Fuxing Lane, shouting that 唐 and 高氏 were sleeping together outside. At the time, 德忠 had just finished work and returned home. He suddenly heard these words. He knew that his wife was virtuous and 唐 was a scholar. He reasoned that 德隆 was deliberately trying to extort money. However, he was afraid of 德隆's violence and the hooligans he had gathered, so he did not dare to confront him. He went upstairs in shame and, out of anger and frustration, committed suicide by hanging himself in the west corner of the building. By the time people noticed, he had been dead for a long time. His aunt, 唐氏, reported the situation to the Liyuan Road Substation of the Second District General Office. Officer Wang heard the news and immediately sent Patrol Chief Shen to investigate. When they went to pursue 德隆, he had already heard the news and fled. At the time, 唐氏 suspected that 德隆's aunt, 吳張氏 (32 years old), had instigated and incited him, so she took her to the Second District General Office as well. The office ordered the local bailiff to report the matter for inspection and prepared a document to transfer the case to the Judicial Section for investigation.</p>

<p>Wife Attempts Suicide in Anger. A young woman from Beiping named 啹姚氏, 25 years old, and her husband, 德興, had previously served as a county magistrate in the northern provinces and had accumulated some savings. Later, he resigned and came to Shanghai, renting a house at 105 Hexing Lane, Baoxing Road, Zhabei, for two years. A second landlord named Shen, a former director of the Jiangxi Manufacturing Bureau, was now living in Shanghai without any duties. Two days ago, Shen was chatting with 德興 and said, "You have been married for six years and still have no children. Your wife may not be necessary," etc. After being ridiculed, 德興 often quarreled with his wife, 姚氏, and showed signs of unease. The day before yesterday afternoon, Wu returned the marriage certificate to 姚氏 and left in a fit of anger. 姚氏 was shocked and staggered after him. As she reached the entrance of the alley, her husband had disappeared. At that moment, her old nanny arrived and saw her mistress looking panicked. She quickly asked what had happened. 姚氏 told her everything and said that she wanted to throw herself into the river. At that time, the nanny saw that her mistress was inconsolable and, fearing that it would actually happen, couldn't bear to see it. She accompanied her and tried to persuade her. That night, they went together to the Hongkou Grand Hotel and booked Room 50. Yesterday morning, while the nanny was sound asleep, 姚氏 sneaked out and bought four boxes of raw opium. She swallowed two boxes on the spot. When the nanny woke up, she noticed that Yao's face was pale and she was moaning. Knowing that she had taken poison, she quickly reported it to the front desk and ordered the guard to escort her to Tongren Hospital, claiming she was ill. Due to the dangerous symptoms, the hospital transferred her to Guangren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Leaving Behind a Boy. Yesterday morning around 2:00 AM, detectives from the Laoza Gate Police Station went to a Public Security Bureau in the Fifth District of Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, saying that bandits were hiding in the Yuegong Hotel on North Sichuan Road and asked them to send police to assist in the arrest. The director of the station sent police to go with them to Room 32. There was only a boy about five or six years old. The bandits were gone. They took the child away. According to the child, the night before last around 9:00 PM, he was brought there by a stylishly dressed young woman. About half an hour later, the woman went out to shop and never returned.</p>

<p>At 4:00 PM, the weather suddenly changed, with dark clouds and thunder and lightning. Soon, it poured rain. With a loud crack, a large poplar tree in Sandinggou, about three miles west of Songxi, was struck into several pieces. Later, nearby villagers went to check and found nothing unusual. However, there was a large bird's nest on top of the tree that had been turned into powder by the lightning.</p>

<p>The 89th train on the Songhu Railway, traveling upstream, departed from Zhanghuabang Station at 1:29 PM yesterday. As it was traveling to Liyangqitai, a middle-aged man suddenly jumped from a third-class car and fell onto the tracks. He was immediately crushed by the train wheels, and his head and arms were broken. He died instantly. The scene was bloody and gruesome. After the accident, the train stopped. The conductor and ticket collector got off the train and, together with the station master, removed the body. They found that the deceased was about thirty years old, wearing a straw hat, with a monk's haircut, a white undershirt, white and blue striped Western trousers, black socks, and rubber galoshes. Local bailiff 秦寳林 took the train to report to the local court for inspection. The conductor reported to the Road Bureau's Traffic Department for handling.</p>

<p>At 9:15 AM on the 7th of this month, a coolie laborer named 蔡玉明 was pulling a cart on Yalu Road, traveling from west to east. Suddenly, a No. 1052 freight car came speeding from behind, driving in the same direction as the cart. In order to avoid the oncoming vehicles, the car slightly turned the front of the car, causing the cart to overturn. 蔡 was also seriously injured. The policeman on duty came, recorded the number, and sent 蔡玉明 to the hospital. Because the injuries were critical, he died soon after. The hospital notified the police, who sent a detective to investigate and moved Cai's body to the 斐倫 Road morgue. Yesterday morning, the Special District Local Court commissioned Prosecutor 郭懷璞 to conduct an autopsy. After taking his seat, he heard the Western police officer claim that the driver of the car that caused the accident, 马志芳, was guilty of manslaughter. He had been arrested and requested instructions. Mr. Guo verified the confession and ordered the defendant, 马志芳, to be returned to custody for investigation. The body was handed over to his wife, 蔡单氏, for coffining and burial.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Car Accident Killing a Boy Case Resolved <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The six-year-old boy Zhou 羣根 from the family of Zhou 劉氏, a woman living in Xujiahui in the French Concession, was playing with neighbor children in the road in front of his house on the 17th of last month when he was knocked down by a car driven by Xu Jinsheng of Youli Company and died of his injuries. Yesterday, the police summoned both parties to the French Concession Court. First, the police chief stated that the defendant's car had stalled when it arrived at the location. Therefore, many coolies pushed the car to start the engine. Unexpectedly, many children were playing and running around, causing the plaintiff's child to be hit by the defendant's car wheel, fell, was injured, and died. Please investigate. When questioned, the defendant's statement was roughly the same. He also said that the people had now reached a settlement with the family of the deceased, compensating them for losses of 240 yuan. There is now a settlement agreement submitted for review. The Chinese and Western officials judged that the case had been resolved and approved the cancellation of the case.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Human Trafficking Case Cracked on the Jinan Ship <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Five people, including men, women, and children, were arrested. The Taikoo Company's Hong Kong-bound Jinan steamship was about to set sail and leave the port at 11:00 AM yesterday. Investigators Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang from the Women and Children Relief Association boarded the ship to investigate. They saw an elderly man wearing a Western suit and an old woman in the steerage cabin, bringing a young girl and two children, a boy and a girl. They looked like human traffickers, so they questioned them. Unexpectedly, their words were inconsistent, and the situation was extremely suspicious. They were immediately detained and the Water Patrol Police were notified by telephone. Officer Huang Songsheng was immediately dispatched to take the five people, big and small, to the police station for separate interrogation. According to the man, he was named Yang Shoulai, 53 years old, from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province. He used to be a supervisor at the Telephone Company and had retired. His wife had also passed away. He was now living with a widow named Wang (referring to the old woman) at 572 Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. He had three brothers in Hong Kong who had no children. Therefore, he spent money to buy the two children, a boy and a girl, to take to Hong Kong and give to his brothers as children. The young girl, Yang A'mei, was also bought as a daughter by him when she was eight years old. Today, they sent us to board the ship but did not go to Hong Kong, etc. According to the old woman, her surname was Wang, 48 years old, from Beiping. Her husband had died early, leaving behind two sons and a daughter. The eldest son, A'tong, 18 years old, was learning to be a switchboard operator at the telephone bureau. The second son, A'song (the boy who was caught), was 7 years old, and the daughter, A'nan (the girl who was caught), was 10 years old. They were all her children, etc. According to the young girl, her name was Yang A'mei, 16 years old, from Guangdong. She answered that she did not know what was asked. According to the boy, his name was A'song, 7 years old, born in the Year of the Rat, from Tianjin. His parents both lived in the French Concession, and he had forgotten the address. He had four brothers at home and was the third. He had been to the woman's (referring to Wang's) house two weeks ago. The woman was not his mother. Today, he did not know where she was taking him. According to the girl, her name was A'nan, 10 years old, from Ningbo. She had heard her mother (referring to Wang) talk about how she was sent to live with someone else as a baby and was only brought back when she was four years old. She did not know if she was born to Wang, etc. The police chief investigated the case and found that the statements of the five people were very different. The adults and children spoke Cantonese, Northern dialect, and Ningbo dialect. What was even stranger was that the boy denied that Wang was his mother, even though Wang claimed that the two children were her own. The girl also had doubts about Wang and did not directly recognize her as her mother. It was obvious that they were not telling the truth. At 2:00 PM, he ordered Detective Wu Rongsheng to take the five people, big and small, to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Reopening of Debate in Nephew Kidnapping Case <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Xiao Sizi, the four-year-old child of Zhang Guisen, a Yancheng native who runs a restaurant at the Youche Wharf in Nanshi, was kidnapped by his nephew Yang Zhaoxian in collusion with Chen Huanwen, Jiang Wenxuan, and others and hidden in Zhoujia Bridge. He was kidnapped in the morning and rescued that night. After the case was sent to the local court, the debate was concluded. The verdict was about to be announced, but the content of the case was bizarre and of great importance. Therefore, the judge specially reopened the debate yesterday. Yang Zhaoxian denied that he kidnapped the person for money, saying that he just liked his cousin and took him to play. However, the confessions of the other defendants had already been mostly admitted, but they did not admit to participating in the kidnapping. The interrogating official then announced the conclusion again and listened to the announcement of the verdict. The defendants were still remanded in custody.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Zhang Zhu's Lawsuit for Divorce <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the debate did not start.</p>
<p>The standard for identifying syphilis is that the young woman Zhang Zhu's is only seventeen years old, is a native of Cixi, Ningbo. Last year, on November 26 of the lunar calendar, with Xu Juxing, Lou Shunxing, and others as matchmakers, she married Zhang Yuefang. Unexpectedly, they soon quarreled. Now, she has hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to file a divorce lawsuit with the local court, asking for 4,000 yuan in compensation and the return of 1,094 yuan in dowry and clothing. The total request is 5,094 yuan. The reason is that the defendant has syphilis, which the plaintiff was infected with, and was abused and beaten, resulting in injuries, with blood-stained clothing as evidence. She requested permission to divorce. The defendant, Zhang Yuefang, also hired lawyer Sha Xunyi to respond and filed a counterclaim requesting cohabitation. His statement was roughly as follows: Since the plaintiff's return to her mother's home, the relationship between the two parties has been very close. Unfortunately, the plaintiff's mother is very violent. In May of this year, the counterclaimant's father was critically ill. The plaintiff's mother repeatedly instructed her daughter to make noise and divide the property. The counterclaimant's father could not bear the disturbance, so he wrote a will. On June 2, the counterclaimant's father died. At this point, the plaintiff repeatedly requested to manage and divide the rights to the entire property she obtained. The counterclaimant did not agree because of the property rights, and a quarrel broke out. Her mother helped from the sidelines. On June 22, the plaintiff returned to her mother's home. On the 28th, the counterclaimant personally went to pick her up. Unexpectedly, after returning for one night, she asked the counterclaimant for five yuan the next day, ostensibly to buy shoes. She left and never returned. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff secretly took a bank savings book (with 200 yuan) and jewelry. She requested that the claim be rejected and ordered to cohabit, etc. The reasons are divided into two points: (A) The evidence of syphilis is easily transmitted. However, whether the transmission is from B to A or from A to B, even a famous doctor may not be able to determine. The counterclaimant is now in good health and shows no signs of syphilis. The plaintiff's request for divorce based on this uncertain fact has no legal basis. This is the first illegal request to reject the plaintiff's claim. (B) The claim of being beaten and injured is even more fabricated. There are conditions for injury to constitute divorce, which cannot be asserted with empty words. The plaintiff's complaint did not state where the injury was, what part of the body was harmed, or even the number of times, date, or year of the beating. She only used the words "blood-stained clothing as evidence" as confirmation of the request for divorce. Whether this kind of blood-stained clothing is fake or real is unknown, but it lacks the necessary elements for legal research and cannot be considered true. This is the second illegal request to reject the plaintiff's claim, etc. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge 童繩履 specially opened the Fourth Court for trial. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. First, the plaintiff Zhang Zhu's stated that she was 17 years old, from Ningbo, and lived at her uncle's house in Wuxing Lane, Beller Road. The interrogating official said, "You are not old enough." The plaintiff replied, "My mother is in the audience." The official ordered the plaintiff's mother, Zhu Lin's, to come forward and state that she was 38 years old this year. The official asked, "Do you know that your daughter is filing a lawsuit?" She replied, "I know." The official ordered Lin's to step down and asked Zhang Zhu's what kind of request she had. She replied, "I request a divorce and the return of my dowry, clothing, and compensation, etc." He asked, "What is the reason?" She replied, "He beats me, even causing me to bleed." He asked, "Is it the blood on the clothes?" She replied, "Yes." (She was wearing a white short shirt stained with blood, and there was also a tear of about an inch at the neckline). He asked, "When did you get married?" She replied, "We got married on November 26 of last year. I have headaches and stomachaches because I have been beaten many times." He asked, "When did he beat you?" She replied, "He beat me on June 7 and 18 of this year. I went to Guangci Hospital for treatment." He asked, "Do you have the savings book with 200 yuan?" She replied, "Yes, it is mine."</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>The official ordered the defendant Zhang Yuefang to come forward and state that he was 25 years old, from Dinghai, lived at 1 Yongxing Lane, Zongyu Lane, Zhabei, and currently worked on a ship. He asked, "Did you hit her?" He replied, "No." He asked, "Do you have syphilis?" He replied, "No." The interrogating official attempted mediation in court, but the plaintiff insisted on divorce, so the mediation failed. The interrogating official then said to the lawyers of both parties, "We will not start the debate today. We will wait for both parties to be tested for syphilis and then set a date for a continued hearing." After the order was issued, the court adjourned.</p>

<p>At 5:27 AM yesterday, a wisp of blue smoke suddenly rose from the 滙芳 Sawmill at 9 恩路, Hongkou. After a while, the fire was raging and threatened to spread. Fortunately, the Hongkou Fire Department was nearby and immediately drove fire engines to put out the fire. It was not extinguished until 6:30 AM. It is estimated that about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan worth of timber and foreign pine were burned. It is said that the sawmill had fire insurance of 140,000 taels.</p>

<p>Export Hat Industry The Export Hat Industry Association, regarding the Cao Mao Donation Bureau established by Bao merchants in Zhejiang Province, illegally collected donations on exported Cao Mao. After learning of this, the association convened a meeting the other day. Chairman Yang Wenlin delivered a speech, roughly stating that in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the National Government, in order to develop national trade and protect the livelihoods of ordinary people, approved the request of the association. The Ministry of Finance issued a notice to all customs bureaus stating that all Cao Mao exports would be exempt from taxes and duties. This has been implemented for a long time. Recently, Cao Mao merchants in Zhejiang Province have insisted that exported Cao Mao be sold domestically, arbitrarily levying harsh taxes, deliberately creating difficulties, not only harming industry and commerce, but also disregarding the Ministry's orders. Regarding how to deal with this matter, most of the members decided to send Ma Zhongda, Wang Bingyan, Sun Deyu, and Chuan Jiliang as representatives to conduct on-site investigations in Yuyao, the production area. According to the investigation report yesterday, the situation was indeed true. The four representatives then went to Hangzhou to present the matter to the Zhejiang Finance Department. Chief Jiang received them. After the representatives reported the actual situation, they requested that the various bureaus be notified immediately to prevent such acts of harming merchants and disturbing the people from happening again. After hearing this, Chief Jiang also agreed and promised to issue a notice. He also said that if the bureau illegally collects taxes, the representatives can file a complaint with the court.</p>
<p>Silk and Satin Industry The Silk and Satin Industry Association held its second executive committee meeting yesterday. Chairman Lu Zhengbing. The agenda was as follows: (1) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce forwarded the Social Bureau's instructions, stating that in the future, if merchants encounter liquidation matters, they should handle them in accordance with the Accountants Act, and not follow the customs and adopt incomplete liquidation procedures. It was resolved that all members be notified accordingly. (2) Regarding the failure to reach a consensus on increasing cargo plates, please reiterate the previous proposal and implement it earnestly. It was resolved to notify all members that from September 1st, an additional 1.5 fen of tin should be added, and no discrepancies should be allowed. (3) The Ministry of Industry and Commerce announced the revised Article 10 of the Implementing Rules of the Industry and Commerce Association Law regarding the number of member representatives, which is inconsistent with Article 12 of the Association's Articles of Association. Regarding the request to amend the Ministry's order, it was resolved that Article 12 of the Association's Articles of Association, which states that each company can elect one representative, be changed to "can elect one to two representatives." The last sentence of the same article, "but not more than two," be changed to "but not more than three." This will be submitted for ratification at the members' general meeting. (4) The end of September in the Gregorian calendar is the time for autumn festival account settlements. All debts between the Association's members and various customer groups must be settled on schedule. It was resolved to distribute a notice and strictly comply.</p>
<p>Tobacco Exchange Industry The Tobacco Exchange Industry Association held its sixth executive committee meeting yesterday. First, the chairman reported on the progress of various association affairs. Then, the following proposals were discussed: (1) Xiang Mao Soap, the manager of China Soap Company, previously offered prize draws to promote sales to members of the Association, which encouraged many to actively sell on consignment. However, the company's current prize draw methods are unfair, and members are deeply suspicious. Regarding how to discuss and deal with this matter, it was resolved to convene a general meeting of all consigning members at 1:00 PM on the 11th of this month, and to invite representatives from relevant companies to attend and discuss appropriate measures together. (2) The recent price drop of Fairy Brand cigarettes has caused significant losses to tobacco shops in the north and south that purchased the goods previously. Regarding how to calculate this, it was resolved to send a letter to the company to inquire about the details. (3) The Candle Industry Association sent a letter requesting that the Association inform its members engaged in the candle industry to voluntarily abolish the practice of giving gifts with purchases in order to protect each other's costs. It was resolved to reply to the Association, expressing a strong willingness to cooperate, but requiring them to be responsible for ensuring that no candle industry member engages in this practice again. Finally, other important matters were discussed and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Industrial Rationalization (Continued) by Cheng Zhenjun <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Extreme prosperity inevitably leads to decline, which is also the result of fierce competition. Therefore, the government should adopt a laissez-faire policy, allowing people to develop freely and adjust freely, only protecting the property they have acquired through competition, and industries will inevitably prosper. This principle has not changed for more than a hundred years. Although the government has sometimes imposed restrictions for the benefit of the people, and the people have mutually exempted themselves from competition, and have jointly set prices and complied with them, or have merged into large companies, it is ultimately felt that the material life of the world is extremely complex and that it is beyond human power to organize and control it. Today, the unpredictable fall of prices, the overproduction, the large number of unemployed, the imperfect organization of enterprise institutions, and the annual loss of money are all due to the crudeness of economic principles and the failure to conduct in-depth research, the laissez-faire economic policy and the failure to manage with concerted efforts. The International Economic Conference, aware of these malpractices, followed the successful experience of Germany and proposed the suggestion of industrial rationalization to the world. The chorus of welcome from various countries has long been deafening. Some have established special agencies to implement it, while others have set up similar agencies to carry out the work in different ways. The Japanese are also chanting the mantra, and the words "industrial rationalization" (the Japanese word for industry is the same as our word for industry) are often seen on the lecture stage and in magazines and newspapers. In our country, however, it is still silent. Some may say that our country has been plagued by years of war, and people have been displaced, so how can we have the leisure to follow the new suggestions of the League of Nations? However, the war will eventually end, and the front line will not extend to the whole country. As long as we still have a breath, and have a little room to maneuver, we should widely disseminate this new economic thought and new economic plan, which is related to everyone and everything. Is not our central government still striving for construction during the difficult and arduous period of suppressing rebellion? Are not all provinces of our country, in the midst of disasters and calamities, still united from top to bottom, persevering and resolutely carrying out construction in different ways? At this time of concerted construction, there should naturally be the most excellent economic thought and the most suitable economic plan to lead the way, so as not to waste funds and go astray, and the poverty of the whole country can be alleviated. Industrial rationalization is the most excellent and most suitable economic thought and economic plan for our country. Our country has always lacked research, while rationalization emphasizes research; our country has always been unscientific, while rationalization emphasizes science; our country has always been indifferent to the success or failure of the people's industries, the high or low of prices, while rationalization emphasizes management; our country consumes a great deal in all aspects, while rationalization emphasizes eliminating consumption; our country has recently experienced many labor-capital disputes, while rationalization emphasizes labor-capital cooperation. The rest can be inferred by analogy, and there is no need to elaborate. In short, rationalization is indeed a good medicine for saving our country. We should welcome it with 120,000% sincerity. When we welcome it, we should also have a belief, that is, to examine things with scientific methods. Only in this way can we be said to accept rationalization, because rationalization must first be reformed in thought. Mr. F.W. Taylor of the United States, the inventor of scientific management, when asked about the meaning of scientific management, often replied, "This is a revolution in thought." His meaning is that scientific management cannot be merely prescribed by a plan, because it contains a new attitude of mind. Rationalization is also the same. The mind must be changed first, and then the plan can be discussed. Gentlemen, have your minds accepted rationalization? If it has been accepted, I will continue to talk about its plan. If it has not yet been accepted, please study the above carefully, and only look at the following when you are willing to accept it. The scope of rationalization is very broad, almost all-encompassing. How can I talk about its plan in a short article? However, if I omit it and do not talk about it, it seems that people will still not understand what rationalization is doing and how to implement it. I dare to summarize and briefly describe the outline, and extend it, hoping that in the future, according to history and the order of evolution, the foundation of all economic life is of course in agriculture, and there are many things that should be done for agricultural rationalization, such as weather forecasting, soil analysis, testing of various fertilizers, testing of various seeds, selection or modification of farm tools, whether or not machinery is suitable for use, how to build water conservancy projects, in order to permanently avoid water and drought disasters, how to eliminate insect pests, how to plan agricultural economics, how to manage farms, and how to organize agricultural extension. All of these should be studied and tested with scientific methods to obtain rational results and implement them. It is absolutely impossible to rely solely on personal experience or the traditional methods passed down from ancient times, and to stick to them without breaking them. It is especially impossible to rely solely on intuition and act arbitrarily. Animal husbandry and fisheries should also be managed using the latest methods. All methods of grading, selling, storing, and packaging food, and food preservation, must be specially researched by experts, and the most appropriate methods must be selected and promoted. The unnecessary consumption saved in the process cannot be measured by quantity. Furthermore, regarding the manufacture of factories, there are many types of factories, and they cannot be described separately. Here, I will specifically focus on their common matters and briefly list the uses of rationalization as follows. All factories should employ technical experts to be responsible for design and other work. The manufacturing methods and products should be researched and improved from time to time. If the machinery is defective or the tools are unfavorable, they should also be replaced with the superior ones obtained from the tests. The cost must be gradually reduced, and the output must be gradually improved or increased. Sometimes, supervisors or workers can express very effective opinions, and the factory should naturally find ways to encourage them. In terms of labor, either replace it with machinery, or change the method of exertion, or remove inconvenient places, or increase safety measures. All of these are sufficient to reduce labor and save expenses. In modern times, major factories use continuous processing and conveyor systems, which can increase efficiency several times. The finished products are strictly inspected to ensure that they meet the specified standards, which can also increase credibility and facilitate sales. Moreover, scientific inventions, obtained from trials and research, often give manufacturing a new look and shock the world, such as the paper temperature coking of coal and the multi-faceted refining of diesel, are examples. Every factory has my consumption, and eliminating consumption is an important goal of rationalization, and should be paid attention to and researched everywhere, in everything, and at all times, so that consumption can be eradicated. Furthermore, in terms of management, scientific management in the United States has long become a specialized discipline in universities, and its use in factories and stores has achieved great results. Scientific management is a part of rationalization, such as organization, cost planning, daily affairs, office methods, statistics, employment of employees, purchase of raw materials, labor-capital relations, markets, transportation, sales, advertising, and financial forecasting, all of which must be studied item by item using scientific methods, and then efficiency can be increased. Speaking of production and distribution, there are many more rational laws that can be adopted, because distribution consumes the most, and many of the middlemen can be eliminated. In recent times, mass production has meant that producers have often researched market issues themselves, and do not rely on wholesalers. Moreover, customers often want to deliver goods by a certain date and purchase directly, and there cannot be too many twists and turns. From this, issues of local purchasing power, advertising issues, trademarks and packaging issues, and even the issue of manufacturing and retailing together, are all studied in detail using scientific methods to find rational solutions and implement them. At present, many distribution businesses are still in the hands of retailers, and retailers cannot achieve the benefits enjoyed by large enterprises. In fact, they can also be managed by cooperative methods. Recently, department stores have developed greatly because management can be centralized and buyers are very convenient. There is also a type of chain store specializing in the same business, which can make large-scale purchases and compare business conditions and goods in various places. Now there are even more advanced chain department stores appearing, which combine the benefits of chain stores and department stores into one. In this distribution work, issues such as the sale, display, storage, packaging, and transportation of goods to customers can all be studied using scientific methods. From the salesperson at the counter to the general manager, the manual procedures in between can often save a lot and achieve huge economic benefits. Wholesalers or retailers can also learn about the trends of customer needs to determine changes in styles, and can explore their psychology to determine the number of buyers of a certain type of goods. These are all matters that should be paid attention to in distribution. Furthermore, in terms of consumers, there is value in researching food, clothing, and housing. Nutritious foods are not necessarily expensive, and dazzling fabrics cannot resist the cold. If you put a little thought into home furnishings, you can often increase beauty and convenience without spending anything or spending very little. As for the various unnecessary displays of extravagance in weddings, funerals, and celebrations, and the various unnecessary social interactions of giving gifts and inviting guests, all of these should be drastically reduced to a minimum. The habits and customs passed down through the ages should all be re-examined, retaining what is rational and removing what is irrational, without any compromise. This is called rationalization. All the money saved by eliminating consumption should be saved in banks or invested in real industries to make finance circulate and industries develop, and to save China from poverty. These are all the responsibilities of the people, and are also matters that should be included in rationalization. The above are the directions in which rationalization is carried out in terms of production, manufacturing, distribution, and consumption. Now, in terms of industry and commerce, from small organizations to large organizations, some of the important methods that various countries have implemented in rationalization and received great results are briefly described below. For very small enterprises, such as those that employ only two to twelve employees, there are also many work methods and equipment that need to be studied in detail. Employers cannot be engineers, business experts, economists, and psychologists at the same time, but they can often contact these academies or purchase their publications so that they can learn about and apply various knowledge. They can also discuss and study with their peers and strive for cooperation. They must not continue to hold on to the idea of secrecy, thinking that their peers will be jealous and compete with each other. It must be known that the main purpose of rationalization is to eliminate competition. Many of our country's businesses and industries have been ruined by competition, often lowering prices to the point where the selling price is lower than the cost, and they have to resort to many tricks to deceive customers. Although there are public agreements among the same trade, they are regarded as worthless. If this is not changed for a long time, they will all perish together. Therefore, changing competition into cooperation is the first essential. Medium-sized production and distribution companies face even more organizational problems that urgently need scientific research and control to achieve good results. Otherwise, responsibilities will be unclear, blame will be shifted, consumption will be high, and disputes will arise repeatedly. This must be taken seriously. Our country's business companies have absolutely no appropriate organization. All businesses rely on the planning of one or two people, which is the same as the Western so-called "rule of thumb." However, the rule of thumb is unscientific and absolutely cannot coexist with scientific management. The United States was the first to create scientific management, and its industry and commerce have taken off rapidly. Other countries have adopted it and achieved remarkable results. Why should our country lag behind for so long? The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has already established a Scientific Management Research Association to promote it. It is hoped that all companies above the medium level in the country will rise up and adopt it. There are a large number of small and medium-sized businesses and factories, and they are like a sheet of loose sand, without any organization. The government has never asked about them. How can they do rationalization? I believe that as long as the personnel in charge of these businesses are careful to study things and use common sense, they will be able to eliminate a lot of consumption, and there will be many improvements. Regarding scientific issues, the first thing they need to do is to organize themselves. The second thing is for the government to do its best to guide and assist them. Now I will give a real example to illustrate this. There are more than 1.3 million independent craftsmen in Germany, employing more than 4 million apprentices and artisans. They have organized the Craftsmen's Association and divided it into 62 branches according to region. Within a region, they are further divided into small industry associations according to occupation, which recruit apprentices, hold examinations, elect officers, pay pensions, and handle registration. However, the government must send personnel to supervise the examinations and elections. In 1924, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce established a Craftsmen's Committee to resolve disputes in legal matters, provide loans when necessary in economic matters, and have experts study the improvement of various handicrafts and matters such as hygiene and safety in knowledge matters, and disseminate the results to the craftsmen concerned, either in writing or through lectures, and sometimes even show movies or slides. If this is done, with the people and the government working together, what can't be done? What is so difficult about rationalization? The rationalization of the above-mentioned small factories can all be applied to large factories and increase its importance. The matters that should be paid attention to in large factories are further described separately below. Labor-capital relations, is a very big problem in large factories. In our country, it has gradually become tense. Employers and managers lack world vision and scientific knowledge. Once they encounter this difficulty, they are at a loss. As a result, various industries are stagnating. Various countries have also had such disputes, but since the adoption of rationalization or scientific management, they have gradually decreased. This is because the lives of workers should be stabilized, and the personality of workers should be taken care of. The reasons why workers are unwilling to work hard should be studied calmly and peacefully. If there are difficulties in their families, help them solve them. If there are unfavorable places in their working environment, try to improve them. Reward their savings, encourage them to invest, and increase their salaries according to statistics such as work performance, length of service, and number of children. In addition to shareholders and employees, workers can also receive a considerable portion of the profits. In short, make the labor and capital sides one, sharing benefits and sharing losses. Then, labor will naturally work hard, and all kinds of consumption can be saved. Regarding affairs, they must be handled strictly. Regarding regulations, they must be strictly implemented. All scientific methods must be adopted as much as possible to increase production. By doing this with one heart and one mind, the money saved and the increased income will definitely be enough to offset the expenses added to labor welfare and there will be a surplus. This is one of the reasons for the rapid development of industry in the United States. It is not to be ignored. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Guest (knocking on the door of a small house and asking a young man who has been married for more than a year)—Sir, are you the master of this house?</p>
<p>Young man—No. The master of this house is sleeping peacefully in the cradle. He is the authority of the family. You only need to ask my wife to know.</p>

<p>Fat man—Why are you staring at my face all the time? What are you doing?</p>

<p>— Qing Song Jushi</p>
<p>A certain Mr. Yu, a friend of mine, has been serving in the Central Army for many years. He is intelligent and brave, deep and resolute, and decisive in his work. This time, in the campaign to suppress Yan and Feng, he was promoted by the Central Government and appointed as a battlefield inspector. He traveled tirelessly on the Longhai and Jinpu railways, breaking through strongholds and overcoming obstacles. He participated in every battle. Recently, due to the initial stabilization of military affairs, he returned home for a brief rest. After years of separation, we met with joy. According to his description of the situation on the front lines, Generalissimo Chiang's use of troops is like a god, clear in his assessment of the enemy. He knows that war cannot be fought with force, but must be assessed according to the situation and seize the key points. Battles cannot be fought with recklessness, but must be approached with deep thought and observation of changes. Wherever the army goes, it digs deep trenches and builds high ramparts. In addition to densely woven electric fences, branches are piled up to form mountain ridges, so high that they cannot be climbed. They are extremely strong, creating a situation where one man can hold the pass against ten thousand men. In their battle formations, guns, cannons, knives, and spears are divided into teams and interspersed with each other in a methodical and infinitely variable manner. For example, if we divide our forces and try to surround them, then each tunnel and each sentry post will resist separately, combining long and short weapons, and responding to the unusual with the ordinary. They are worthy of being called a disciplined army. In addition, they love and care for their soldiers, and encourage the three armies. The commanders move after careful planning, are brave and know their direction. The machine guns are fierce and unstoppable, and the air force takes advantage of weaknesses. The soldiers are well-fed and the horses are vigorous, and they have righteousness and confidence. However, Yan and Feng are self-willed and poor at assessing people. They have little food and insufficient weapons and ammunition, yet they want to compete with our army. It is clear that they do not know their own limitations. I once heard that Feng was good at attacking and Yan was good at defending. Yan clearly knew this but deliberately violated it. He also made a desperate gamble, using the large knife units to attack and storm fortifications on the Longhai Railway. Day after day, he drove bodies of flesh and blood into the fierce heat of the sun and the power of artillery fire. Although the northwestern warriors are skilled, their brute force and fierce attacks have resulted in heavy casualties and a loss of morale. Although our army has suffered some damage, it is no more than a drop in the bucket. Yan's army occupied Jinan, relying on its fortifications for several days. Its military strength cannot be said to be weak. However, the central palace was not defended, losing the advantage of a commanding position. They had no preparation for rain gear or drainage, and were careless and negligent. Both of these are fatal injuries. Our army is mostly from Guangdong, and is good at swimming and fighting. They thought that if they missed this opportunity, heaven would strike their army. They clenched their fists and rubbed their palms, and advanced together. Above, airplanes dropped bombs. Below, machine guns swept across. Yan's army suspected that the Flying General had descended from the sky. Even if they wanted to fight a battle against the city, they had already been defeated and scattered. They fled in panic across the river. This shows that the two men only have empty reputations, and are not as good as our army, whose attack and defense are coordinated and appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="e136">President Chiang's Passion for Painting <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Bi Hua</p>
<p>President Chiang, who has worked hard and achieved great merit, is fond of calligraphy and painting, especially landscapes. Recently, because the scenic spot of Xuedou in Fenghua is the best in all of Zhejiang, it is a pity that there are no famous painters to take a true picture of it, which he deeply regrets. There is a certain Shi Hou, a Buddhist monk, who was born into a prominent family but has escaped into the Buddhist faith. He is good at painting landscapes and his name is highly regarded for a time. Those who obtain his paintings cherish them as if they were the most precious jade. When this matter was reported to Chiang, he was asked to go to Fenghua to take real pictures on the spot. Shi Hou went as ordered and painted a draft of forty paintings. The layers of green are stacked upon each other and the scenery is excellent. It is worthy of being a famous scenic area. The other day, I visited Shi Hou at the Shanghai South Water Immortal Palace. He showed me unfinished drawings. The brushstrokes were old and powerful, which was admirable. I expect that when the paintings are completed, they will be famous and valuable. President Chiang's concern for his hometown and his passion for painting are truly commendable. I have written this down.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Funeral for Mrs. Qian Shoutie <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>Ms. Han Buyi from Yun Jian, named Xiu, was skilled in painting and proficient in Han clerical script. Three years ago, her sister's husband, Sun Xuenie, acted as matchmaker, and she married Qian Shoutie, a renowned figure in epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting. They were inseparable and deeply in love. Recently, she suddenly passed away from a lung ailment, much to the regret of those who knew her. On the sixth of this month, a memorial service was held at Chongfa Temple on Guling Road. Numerous figures from the literary and artistic circles attended. The plaster statue provided at the service was a gift from Jiang Xiaojian, exuding grace and a lifelike resemblance. Prominent painters such as Hashimoto Kansetsu from Japan all sent large floral wreaths. The elegiac couplets were exquisite beyond description. Here, I selectively record some of the most remarkable ones. Wang Yiting's couplet read: "Du Lanxiang departed long ago, leaving behind jade slips; Lü E'hua arrives without a fixed abode, a mere fantasy of golden rings." Yu Youren's couplet read: "Three years of shared hearts, graced by gentle breezes in the evening; Six months of lung ailment, dew foreshadowing autumn." Sun Xuenie's couplet read: "The official document sealed a good match, marrying her to Zhou Lang; The Jiangzu region praised her as a female scholar, her epitaph becoming her final work; Devastated, like Xun Ling, I see no Lady Guan in the hall." The wording was appropriate and the double entendres clever. However, the one that most impressed this reporter was Xie Jinyu from Wujin: "Jade pendants are lost in the heavens, hastily departing from the feast; A crane's back carries a short dream on the celestial wind; The spiritual herbs of Huangshan are exhausted, the painting scrolls remaining; The dragon palace pillows cause the autumn waves to grieve." Exquisitely beautiful, every word carefully chosen, truly deserving of first place. My old friend Ren Jinshu's couplet read: "A precious couple entrusted to ephemeral existence, her small portrait engraved in my heart; A fragile body, thinner than an autumn swallow; A love that sealed a vow in heaven; Paintings wounding the soul, dark dust obscuring the night cicada." Combining sorrow and beauty. Others, such as Huang Taixuan's couplet, read: "Three years achieved success swiftly, excelling in painting and calligraphy, truly a talented woman; Two marriages still seeking milk, fragmented silk and remnant paper, leaving sorrow to old friends." The wording was poignant, offering a fresh perspective. He Tianjian's couplet read: "Meeting in autumn on the sea, how can one bear to be like Pan Qi from Jiannan; Transforming into a crane in Yun Jian, her previous life must have been Du Lanxiang." The lines were also detached and transcendent. The rest are difficult to recall. Upon returning, I take up my pen to record them.</p>
<h3 id="e138">After Watching "Wang Zhaojun" <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— A Wanderer on the Edge of the World</p>
<p>The Xi Society's opera department's first performance of "Wang Zhaojun" took place at the New Oriental Theater near Yokobashi on North Sichuan Road. Having been invited by Gui Gongchuang, a staff member of the society, I attended the performance on the evening of September 4th around 7 p.m. I have much to record from what I saw.</p>
<p>The main character in the play is Ms. Li Lilian, who played Zhaojun. According to someone, she is very emotional, so her performance was extremely sad and delicate. In the third act, Zhaojun sang a solo, which Ms. Li performed in the "Cantonese Ballad" style, her voice clear and bright, evoking a sense of Lingnan folk songs and inspiring an aesthetic appreciation. Mr. Zhang Junxie, who played Emperor Yuan, wore ancient costumes and sang in a European style. As Mr. Zhu Yingpeng said on the first page of the script, "Although drama expresses life, it also has spatial and temporal aspects. What it expresses should be a response to the times. 'New wine in old bottles' may seem somewhat comical, but it actually contains something truly new." He also said, "Meaningful new dramas can draw on ancient themes, but ancient dramas should be given a new interpretation and imbued with a new life." In this light, Mr. Zhang's use of a Western style to sing about Han Dynasty events, perhaps, contained elements of new life? Furthermore, Ms. Hu Manqian, who played the palace maid, had a natural demeanor and clear articulation. Li Hua's Huhanxie and the four or five who played the foreign riders had makeup, expressions, and tones that were rough and boisterous, reminding one of the barbaric state of the Huns back then. Other roles, such as Mr. Zhou Juanhong's overly courteous censor and Mr. Huang Huang's doddering record keeper, as well as the several little girls who played the lively children of Chang'an, were all excellent. The actors being like this, the scenery and plot were also well-matched. What was most commendable was that the actors were Cantonese but spoke standard Mandarin fluently. This was the second day of the society's performance, and the results were already remarkable. It is said that it will continue until the end of the month, with a new program every ten days. In that case, it will undoubtedly become more polished and impressive. Gentlemen who love drama, why not go and see it for yourselves?</p>
<h3 id="e139">A Brief Account of Xixi <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Yingchuan Furun</p>
<p>Furun, a native of Xixi, would like to talk about the events of Xixi. I think that readers would be delighted to hear them.</p>
<p>Xixi is located outside Qiantang Gate in Hangzhou, starting from Songmu Chang and ending at Liuxia Town, flowing along the mountains for eighteen li. The water is clear and pure, and the scenery is exceptionally beautiful. Whenever there is a moonlit night or a flowery morning, one can row a boat in Luhua Bay, where the reflection of the peaks is inverted, creating a constantly changing panorama, giving one a sense of being detached from the world.</p>
<p>In the past, there were many plum trees on both banks, with jade pressing against sandalwood. Spreading horizontally across the stream, the moonlight after snow was nothing but pictorial and poetic. Today, however, it is a small calamity of vicissitudes, with rows of elm and willow trees. The spring scenery of Jiangnan is outshone by Dengwei. "Exploring Plum Blossoms in Xixi" only occupies one spot among the ten scenic spots of Qiantang in name only.</p>
<p>In Anle Shanyang, there is Yongxing Temple, an ancient temple from the Tang Dynasty. The Song Dynasty Buddhist monk Jigong once stayed here. According to legend, a local who ate snails would cut off their tails. Jigong took pity on them and begged to throw them into the flowing water in front of the temple, and they all lived. Now, five hundred years later, the snails still exist. The four so-called great families of Xixi were Shen Banjie (house), Wang Shiwu (wealth), Ma Laoye (power), and Cen Mantang (sons). But now, the Shen house has changed hands, the Wang family has declined, the Cen descendants are not prosperous, and Ma Er died early. Human affairs are full of changes, in general.</p>
<p>Huawu is located on a non-mountain road, backed by Dingzi Lake. Surrounded by mountains, it contains a small stream. The sun-遮蔽 bamboos and pines, cold-hearted springs and stones. The thrush sings all day long. It is no less than a fairyland. Many eminent monks and men of letters lived here, whistling and singing. Green歙 swords and red fish provide much adornment. Tourists compare it to the Shanyin Road.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Internal Politics of Post-War Poland (IV) <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Li Liu Zeng, sent from Paris</p>
<p>Therefore, the initial goal of the French was to gradually unify the laws concerning public order and commercial activities. The first law promulgated and implemented throughout the country was a criminal procedure law, followed by several regulations on nationality and one on company bylaws. In addition, a decree was promulgated to amend the provisions on women's rights in the former Prussian region, because those restrictions on the abilities of married women conflicted with the laws in force in other parts of Poland. As for the remaining items, most of the several laws formerly in use were recognized as valid, but a new decree was enacted to resolve the legal disputes arising from the simultaneous existence of these various legal systems.</p>
<p>The provisional government has established a law codification committee, whose work is currently still in progress. The most difficult task is the compilation of civil law, the current difficulties being not only legal issues, but also many moral and political issues. Marriage regulations are one of the most difficult issues to resolve. In the future, will Polish law stipulate civil marriage or religious marriage? Will divorce be allowed, or absolutely forbidden? This serious issue has sparked heated debate in political circles. Some parliamentarians have proposed an interesting compromise, according to which civil marriages permitting divorce and religious marriages not permitting divorce would coexist. Those marrying could choose either form beforehand.</p>
<p>Due to limited space in this newspaper, the reporter cannot list all the difficulties in unifying Polish internal affairs and conduct more specialized research. However, from the above, it can be seen that the Polish government is striving for unity in both administration and justice amidst all difficulties. Although the current achievements are not entirely satisfactory, there are extenuating circumstances. Although the future is full of difficulties, the government's work is easier to carry out because of Poland's nationwide desire for internal unity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, whether Polish internal affairs can be unified is not only related to the interests of the Polish people. It also has a great impact on European peace. If Poland has only a unified name, but the judicial and administrative systems and other institutions in various parts of the country differ from each other, continuing the old habits of the partition era, then Poland will be in danger, as will European peace. Conversely, if Poland can be truly united and integrated as a whole, then its national power will increase day by day, and it can become a buffer zone for the powers of Central Europe, which has no small relationship with the prospects for peace.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Emerald Bamboos and Mottled Doors, Her Heart Breaks; Red Lotus Fragrance Fades, a Daughter Departs from Home</p>
<p>Because of this impression, Cuiyun thought that the Ningbo old woman was so frightening, and she couldn't help but turn pale at the mention of Ningbo people, thinking that all Ningbo women were tigresses. In reality, this is not entirely true. Their men have a kind of daring nature, and of course the women also have this courage to dare to act. Although Cuiyun felt that Zhang Yiqing was a bit older, he was still alright. She was just afraid of the Ningbo old woman's power, and couldn't help but hesitate a bit. However, Zhang Yiqing repeatedly requested, and even knelt down to beg her to agree. Cuiyun also asked his close friends, who often came with him, for details. None of what Zhang Yiqing said was a lie. He did have a wife living in the countryside of Ningbo, who had never been to Shanghai. Zhang Yiqing did go back to Ningbo once a year, and sometimes didn't even go back once. This wife could be considered as if she didn't exist. Other than happily sending some money back to the countryside, there seemed to be no relationship at all. That friend also told her that Zhang Yiqing's old woman was a completely crude and ugly country woman, who could only be a rough servant compared to you, Miss Three. Cuiyun said, "We can't say that. As the saying goes, the one who enters the door first is the elder for three days. No matter what, she's always the '横闊豎', and I'm always the '七大八'." That friend said, "Our Brother Yiqing is naturally satisfied to have someone like you, Miss Three. And you don't go to Ningbo, you live in Shanghai. Who wouldn't call you Tai?" Cuiyun also inquired about Zhang Yiqing's background from his friend. According to that friend, Zhang Yiqing had suffered a lot since he was a child. When he first came to Shanghai, he apprenticed in a small money shop, and even had to empty the master's chamber pot. But he was very hardworking. Because one of his uncles worked as an old secretary in a money house on Houmalu, he relied on his uncle's influence to be recommended to this business. If he quit, no one would be able to recommend him. Later, because he was hardworking and capable, he rose to this position. How could someone without real skills reach this position? Now, in the Shanghai business community, he can be considered someone. Foreigners also trust him. That's really not easy." These friends were all on Zhang Yiqing's side. They were all so-called hangers-on, following his reins every day, running errands for him. Where would there be any truth? They just blew and flattered him. Cuiyun believed it to be true, thinking that she had consulted widely and that her friends were all of one voice, so of course it was reliable. Since the Ningbo old woman was in the countryside, she wouldn't come to Shanghai. In Shanghai, she would naturally be the only one in charge. Added to this was Zhang Yiqing's charm and smooth talk, as well as his lavish displays. In just a few days, Cuiyun agreed to marry him. She thought that she would escape the pit of fire and embark on the road to happiness, finally finding a place to belong to her body.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Commercial News: Financial and Gold Markets Extremely Peaceful <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The atmosphere was calm and rare. Yesterday, the trend of gold prices was peaceful, with only three or two taels of fluctuations throughout the day. The expectation of rising prices seemed to solidify, and such a scene has not been seen since the beginning of this year. Transactions among industry members were still quiet. However, in the morning session, Hengxingsheng, Dada, and other bulls sold off, while buyers were only Chengfengyong and retail clients. Foreign exchange was relatively stable, and banks were dispensing and receiving, but there were no changes in large amounts. Silver prices rose slightly by one-eighth, but overseas market conditions were not very good. In the morning, buyers seemed to be reluctant, so there were some twists and turns of one or two taels after the high opening. Guangdong businesses sold off, and the price plummeted to just over sixty taels. Chengfengyong and others entered the market to buy, and the price recovered, jumping out of sixty-three taels. After repeated setbacks, the market became even more sluggish in the afternoon. It was Wednesday, and the exchange market was closed, with prices differing by only a few cents. It was nothing more than swap deals, with both bulls and bears fearing stimulation, forming a stalemate.</p>
<p>The morning market fluctuated slightly. The opening price for October was one tael and three cents higher, at 562.3 taels. The silver market was peaceful. The gross market showed some simmering, fluctuating between 62 and 63 taels, retreating from 63.1 taels to 1.14 taels. Exchange was generally flat, with British gold for November traded between Japanese banks at 7 pence 625. December traded at 6875. Suddenly, the posting price revealed that it was 1.56 taels, at which time it went back three or four cents. Subsequently, and others sold to Taiwan for October British gold at 7 pence 5625. Zhengjin absorbed this month's share at the same price, so at 9:30, it was 62.12 taels. However, Hengxingsheng, Dada, and others tended to sell off, and this month's British gold could be settled at 7 pence 5625. Sumitomo and others bought October for 625, which immediately weakened. At 10 o'clock, it fell to 60.3 taels. Before long, it jumped up more than two taels, actually because Magali and others ate forward contracts at 7 pence 75. Until after 11 o'clock, it was around 63 taels. It was pressed down by one tael and a few cents at 11:30 to 1.89 taels, due to the selling of Fujun, Zhifengyong, Taikangrun, and others. In an instant, Chengfengyong and others suddenly started buying, and it immediately rose by more than one tael, reaching 63.34 taels. Ten minutes later, it fell by more than two taels, to only 60.8 taels. At noon closing, it was 61.8 taels. The chaos in the market could not be suppressed. The posted price was still 610 taels, with the premium at around 50 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon market, with an earlier closing time, opened at 61.8 taels. It then increased from 1.7 cents to two taels. Retail clients bought, but it suddenly fell back four or five cents. Unfortunately, both bulls and bears were in a silent state on the trading floor, and because it was Wednesday, there was a lack of foreign exchange market, and the market was repeatedly called for closure. At 2:30, it was estimated to be 61.4 taels, then pulled up three or four cents. At 3:30, the market was already declared closed, with the price estimated at 61.8 taels, a rise compared to the previous day. The maximum price for the day was 63.4 taels, and the minimum price was 60.3 taels, a fluctuation of 3.1 taels. The posted premium was 50 taels. The account for September was 73 taels, for October 62 taels, and the supplementary water for 73 taels in the afternoon as well. The early opening for goods was two taels, the noon closing 1.5 taels, the afternoon 1,800 cash, and the closing price 2.2 taels.</p>
<p>Transactions were more slack than usual. Hengxingsheng, Dada, Yuda, Ruikang, Zhifengyong, Taikangrun, Yuanmao, and others had all sold. Chengfengyong, Fuchang, Shunli, Yuanmaoyong, Yuandayong, Yuanxingyong all entered, Dadacheng, Yuanchengyong, Senchangyong with irregular movements. In the afternoon, Wanxing, Yuanmaoyong, and others sold, while buyers were retail clients. Hedgers sold. A small number of transactions from the Dalian businesses, with three or four hundred bars sold and three hundred more entered. Guangdong businesses sold short over a thousand bars.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Foreign Exchange: Apparently Flat, Secretly Strong <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's posted rates for foreign exchange remained unchanged, and European silver prices rose slightly, but not excessively. Silver bars remained unchanged. Exchange rates for Japanese, American, and British were fixed as before. As for the internal market rates in Shanghai banks, the rates for British, American, and Japanese were slightly better, but there were no special highlights. Gold prices fluctuated by only three or two taels, with a common trend. They initially rose, so all exchanges were firm, but then there were some divergences. As a result, British gold shrank by 0.0625 compared to the previous day, American gold shrank by 0.1875, and Japanese gold remained flat. Transactions from Chinese businesses were not weak. Hengxingsheng, Dada, and others settled tens of thousands of pounds, sold by Union Bank of Switzerland (to hedge gold). All houses also sold tens of thousands of pounds. The Japanese banks were buying well, with Zhengjin, Sumitomo, Taiwan, Mitsui, and Magali all absorbing, and various banks doing tens of thousands of pounds among themselves. Union Bank of Switzerland, Holland, and Union Bank of the Netherlands were all shorting, while Sanling, Sumitomo, Taiwan, and National Provincial and Union Bank of England were buying. However, American and Japanese exchanges were both in a slump, and few consulted on them. Zhengjin had done twelve months' British and Japanese exchange at 2 shillings and 0.03125 pence.</p>
<p>British exchange fluctuated by only 0.0625, and transactions were considerable. The morning price for September was 7.5 pence, October 5625, November 625, December 6875. The buying price added 0.0625. Union Bank of Switzerland and Sanling did 10,000 pounds for November in the morning at 625. Sumitomo and Sanling did 10,000 for December at 6875. After 9:30, Holland came out, Sumitomo Taiwan went in, and they did 20,000 for October at 5625. Zhengjin bought 5,000 for the current month at the same price. After 10 o'clock, Sumitomo, Taiwan, Mitsui bought 20,000 for October at 625. Union Bank of Switzerland sold 10,000 for the current month at the same price. Then it sold another 10,000 for the latter half of September at the same price of 5625, which National Provincial and Union Bank of England absorbed. Mac bought 5,000 for October at 75, and then sold 10,000 to National Provincial Bank of England for September at 5625. Union Bank of Switzerland sold 5,000 for October at 5625. At the closing, the price for September was still 7.5 pence, December 6875. The American exchange internal market was very peaceful, and transactions were not strong.

<h3 id="e147">Cotton Yarn Market Struggles to Gain Momentum <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning but rose in the afternoon, but the overall trend remained sluggish. This was mainly due to the slow sales of spot yarn and the increasingly subdued overseas cotton yarn market, leading to a generally bearish sentiment. However, some manufacturers remained firm, increasing their buying pressure. As for the Chaozhou traders, they viewed the ongoing war as never-ending, and their determination to sell off their accumulated inventory became even stronger. The competition between bulls and bears was particularly intense.</p>
<p>The human brand yarn market was weak in the morning but slightly improved in the evening. The market opened weakly due to poor environmental conditions and a further decline in the price of third-grade yarn. Sellers increased, and market sentiment was weak, with prices falling by five to six qian. The second and third sessions remained soft, with distant contracts falling by eight to nine qian and near contracts falling by one to two qian. The afternoon yarn market was relatively stable, but the market tightened slightly due to some buying activity, with prices rising by one, four, and six qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 28,800 bales. It was found that Changfeng sold 1,050 bales, Rongxing 1,750 bales, Gengfeng 950 bales, Yukang 800 bales, Dachangcheng 700 bales, Yicheng 750 bales, and others 400 to 500 bales. Rongxing bought 2,300 bales, Yuda 1,300 bales, Zhenchang 1,900 bales, Yongchang 800 bales, and Jiyi 700 bales, with the remaining 350 to 500 bales.

<p>The cotton market was weak in the morning but firm in the afternoon, but the overall trend remained soft. U.S. cotton rose slightly, but the local weather conditions were less favorable, with intermittent sunshine, leading to uncertainty among market participants. Many participants were bearish due to expectations of a poor harvest. Buying pressure from certain groups remained strong, temporarily maintaining firmness. Spot cotton trading was quiet, with no requests from factories, due to the encroachment of Indian cotton. Therefore, there were no transactions in local cotton.</p>
<p>The Han brand market stabilized slightly in the afternoon. The Han brand market opened weakly due to the rising prices of U.S. cotton, but market sentiment was not strong. Prices trended downward in the second and third sessions, with prices falling by one to one and a half qian in each month. The afternoon market was tight due to unfavorable weather, with buying interest tightening, with prices rising by one to one and a half qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 36,100 dan. Hengde bought 3,100 dan, Yichang 1,400 dan, Jinfeng 2,300 bales, Hengyi 1,000 dan, and others 700 to 1,000 dan.

<p>U.S. Cotton Shorts Covered. Yesterday, U.S. cotton was initially weak due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, but it firmed later due to buying by peers and short covering. Futures rose by six to thirteen points, and spot prices rose by five points. British cotton futures rose by five to six points, and spot prices fell by thirty-one points.

<h3 id="e150">Grain: New Western Japonica Rice Initially Shows Stability <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Few Arrivals at Zhabei Yesterday, few ships arrived at the river, and sales were quiet in the street. The arrival of broken japonica rice from the northern gangs was scarce, and there were various related factors, so the source of supply was greatly affected. The Xieji Company, currently known as a free trading business, has been investigated and approved by the Municipal Council, as reported in a certain newspaper, to not be held liable for past actions and to operate according to shipping regulations in the future. Therefore, rice merchants from the river who were dissatisfied with the evaluation of japonica rice have slightly increased the price per dan for sales to Xieji Company. The japonica rice of Xieji Company is evaluated according to quality and market price. Therefore, although the japonica rice market is scarce, the market is stable. More than forty stones of new Western japonica rice were seen yesterday, with a price of 19 yuan, and the market was stable. New Eastern japonica rice arriving from the river was very cheap, and sellers wanted to raise prices, but because buyers were dissatisfied, the market fluctuated around 17.5 yuan, and the trend remained flat. New sharp-pointed rice initially wanted to rise, but still opened at 15.5 yuan in Hangzhou. New guest sharp-pointed rice remained around 14 yuan, and the situation turned firm. White Yuan continued to show stability, which was due to both arrivals and sales.</p>
<p>Few Arrivals from South Shanghai, Market Sales are Quite Sluggish. The stock of Northern japonica rice is scarce, and the source of arrivals from the lake is still declining. Although medium-quality goods appeared weak, they stabilized in the afternoon, which was due to the small amount of goods. The buying interest for thin paper rice from the southern gangs was normal. This was also due to the impact of low inventory levels, so the above market will be on par with the Zhabei market. The price of new Eastern japonica rice opened at 17.5 yuan, and the market was also unchanged. New sharp-pointed rice and Yuan rice were all stable. The stock of each store was insufficient, and the intention to purchase was quite active, so the buyers in both the north and south markets were very refreshed.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Guest Xian Rice Arrivals Decrease, Prices Rise <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Hunan Rice Being Handled by Tianjin Gang. Yesterday, the market conditions for foreign guest xian rice turned firm. Because the source of supply from Hunan and Jiangxi suddenly decreased, everyone was bullish on the market. However, there were still no large purchases by guest gangs, so the price increase was not fully realized. As a result, only Hunan rice rose by nearly one jiao, because more than 300 bags of Hunan rice were handled by the Tianjin gang. The mentality of the cargo owners became more firm. Jiangxi rice was only handled by local street and rural merchants, and only showed a slight increase of two or three points. The entire market was slightly active due to low inventory levels, and transactions were also small. A total of 800 bags of Hunan Jing were opened at a price of 12.4 yuan to 11.8 yuan, 600 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled early rice at a price of 13.2 yuan to 11.7 yuan, and 100 bags of machine-milled late rice at a price of 14.4 yuan. Only 100 bags of foreign rice were opened, with the large twist at a price of 12.15 yuan. Except for the 300 bags of Hunan rice purchased by the Tianjin gang, all were purchased by local street and rural merchants.</p>

<p>Foreign Wheat Continues to Fall Slightly. Factories Start to Sell Futures. Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, prices for all months gradually fell sharply. Because the price of foreign wheat fell by another four or five jiao, external participants felt uneasy. Factories still maintained buying pressure on the near-term and did not loosen their grip, but they had already begun to sell off the distant months, because foreign flour wheat has gradually entered the market, and factories seem to be cutting off their own lifeline if they continue to squeeze. The price of foreign flour yesterday was lower than the previous week. The price of domestic flour was only 3.75 yuan, and no one was asking about it. Because prices were falling, it was difficult to guarantee that they would not fall again in the future, so everyone was watching. However, with this comparison to foreign countries, the market mentality became softer and softer, so the decline in the distant term reached three fen, and the future seemed to be in a precarious state. As a result, the current month fell by 1.75 fen compared to the previous day, October fell by 2.25 fen, November fell by 2.75 fen, December/January fell by three fen, and February fell by 2.75 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Wheat Futures Plunge by Six to Seven Fen <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Spot Factories Do Not Open... Instead Sell Standards. Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, prices for all months consistently plunged. Because the near-term months saw that the manufacturers were forced to lower prices for spot wheat, the prices of foreign wheat in the distant months continued to fall, and the manufacturers were also selling large quantities of hedged wheat for December and later. This type of action may be because foreign wheat has become fixed, and to protect their interests, they sold standard wheat. In this situation, the external bulls felt that there was no way to resist any longer. As a result, the current month fell by seven fen compared to the previous day, October/November fell by five fen, December fell by seven fen, January fell by six fen, and February fell by seven fen. The spot wheat market remained extremely quiet. Only 292 bags of Xuzhou wheat were opened throughout the day at a price of 4.85 taels, which was about one qian lower than the beginning of the week.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Standard Dalian Soybeans Plunge by One Qian <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Dalian soybean December futures market fell sharply. The production market telegraphed continuous declines, and the Fengqi of the traders was particularly smooth. According to the stable harvest in eastern provinces this year, the intention of merchants to sell was strong, so prices fell back continuously. Yesterday, it fell by as much as 1.2 fen, and the closing price was only 5.25 taels, which is a rare occurrence in the market.</p>

<p>Japanese Car Sugar Delivery is Quiet, Market is Flat. Yesterday, the sugar market's production area telegraphs showed that the price of Cuban spot sugar remained at 1.15625, and the price of New York sugar futures for September was 1.10, with no rise or fall compared to the previous telegram. The price for December was 1.16, down two points, and the price for March of next year was 1.28, and May was 1.37, each down one point. The price of Java spot sugar was 8.75, the price of sugar futures for October was 8.50, and the price for November was 8.375, with no rise or fall compared to the previous. In the Guild Hall market, Dutch sugar, coarse sand white, was sluggish due to slow sales, and buying interest was low. The seller's asking price was eight taels, and there were no buyers. The weakness of the market was evident. 20-grade medium sand was 7.65 taels, fine-ground white sand was 8.1 taels, and transactions were also small. Japanese sugar "Z" mark was 8.1 taels, YT mark was 8.05 taels, 1SH mark was eight taels, and YRO mark was 7.95 taels. Although there were some transactions, the amount was small, and the trend was still weak. Dutch red sugar became weaker and weaker. Yesterday, Wah Sun &amp; Co. sold more than a thousand bags of No. 8 Dutch red sugar at a price of 6.25 taels, and No. 10 goods at 6.5 taels, which were also slightly sold. The market showed signs of decline.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there was still no turnaround in the local foreign silk market. According to reports, the silk market in New York and Lyon continued to be sluggish. Although a telegram from Liubai Factory yesterday morning mentioned that the price for B-grade silk was only 945 taels, the factory's costs were high, and the losses were too great. Although Qianli and others had discussions, it was still difficult to reach an agreement.</p>

Among them, the top-quality drawn core goods opened at 220 taels, and the price remained unchanged. The Wu Yuan gangs made slight purchases from the U.S. Zhuang, but because sales were not large and the inventory was abundant, the market price was four to five taels lower than before. With regards to Gongxi, Baitouzhuang, Ruichang, Qianyi, and other firms have resumed operations in recent days, but the Russian Zhuang is still suspended, and there are no major transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e158">North-South Goods: 7,000 Bags of Black Watermelon Seeds Are Opened <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Sea Yuan Meat Falls Again, Black Watermelon Seeds. Recently, the arrival of black watermelon seeds has been quite large, and the market situation is flat and weak. Yesterday, various firms in Zhenbang and miscellaneous grain merchants in the southern market opened in large quantities, totaling 7,000 bags. It is estimated that besides Kui seeds opening at 9.6 qian to 9.8 qian, Dangshan seeds were at 10 taels to 0.2 qian and 0.4 qian. It is also heard that there are still four or five thousand bags arriving in the next few days, and the market may continue to loosen.</p>
<p>Sea Yuan Meat: Since the new goods rebounded, arrivals have increased again, so the market price yesterday fell by two taels. Opening at 26.5 taels, the rest only fluctuated by a few qian. Market prices loosened, and the market was flat.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Hardware: Only British Steel Plates Are Popular, Up 7.5 Li <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Among British steel plates, 7.5 li has been in high demand recently, so the market supply is tight, and prices have risen steadily. Each dan can be valued at eight taels. Yesterday, gangs from Niuzhuang and Yingkou purchased five to six hundred pieces in succession, so there was less circulating goods. In addition, there are fewer people buying colors such as 2.5 li, half li, and 1 li, so the market is difficult to see booming. The valuation is greatly loosened. Currently, 2.5 li sells for 10 taels and 0.5 qian, half li sells for 7.5 qian, and 1 li sells for 6.75 qian, all of which are one qian lower than before. It is heard that fewer and fewer people are buying colors above half li, so the price is cheaper, only valued at 6.5 taels.</p>

<p>The Henmao Automobile Company announces that "Free Wheeling" is the Stude­baker factory's unprecedented advancement in automobile engine construction. With this feature, the car's driving speed is faster than the engine's rotation. Yesterday, our company displayed this new car at our new showroom at 23 Metcalfe Road, holding the first trial run ever seen in the Far East. The audience was amazed and envious, praising it highly. This new invention contains the ultimate in mechanical engineering principles and is the result of the exhaustive efforts and meticulous research of the Stude­baker factory's leading engineering experts. It is unprecedented and truly remarkable. This feature is available on the Stude­baker President and Commander eight-cylinder new cars. The various advantages are unmatched, and it is not only about making driving more comfortable. "Free Wheeling" means that no matter the vehicle's speed, gears can be shifted at will without using the clutch. The clutch is only needed for the initial start. Once the foot is removed from the accelerator, the engine immediately drops to idling speed, greatly saving gasoline and oil. Notably, ordinary cars consume more gasoline and oil when traffic is congested. However, "Free Wheeling" uniquely saves 12% of gasoline and 20% of oil. As for tires, rear axles, connecting rods, clutches, gearboxes, and other parts that are normally subject to wear and tear, this can be avoided, reducing carbon buildup inside the engine. The car's driving is extremely quiet and safer. The Stude­baker eight-cylinder automobile has been a leader in the automotive world for years, and this great invention is like adding flowers to embroidery. However, the factory's leading engineers are still not satisfied. The wheelbase is lengthened, the car body is enlarged, the effect is more significant, the action is more stable, and the style is more beautiful. As for horsepower, the President has increased from 115 to 122 horsepower, and the Commander has increased from 80 to 101 horsepower. The nine-bearing crankshaft is absolutely balanced, providing extreme smoothness. Other equipment, such as shock absorbers, mufflers, driving gears, as well as the springs, brakes, water tanks, and other parts, and the arrangement of car lights and car seats, are all perfect and extremely suitable. As for the advantages of strong and superior construction, low center of gravity, durability, and extreme comfort, they are renowned worldwide. Therefore, sales are brisk and warmly welcomed by people everywhere.</p>
<p>The Tongchunxiang Foreign Cloth Store at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shilu Road announces that it has been in business for over 60 years and is the only old foreign cloth store on Nanjing Road. Now, to expand business, it is re-equipping and adding various floral silk velvet, wool serge, silk crepe, and other items. Therefore, starting today, it is holding a major sale for 25 days. The store's goods are indeed cheaper than market prices, resulting in unusually crowded customers.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cherry Stamp Company announces that, to expand its business, it has moved to 323 Annakin Road and is operating as usual. Those who wish to obtain exquisite stamps from various countries, please include 50 cents in Chinese stamps and a large bag will be given away.</p>
<p>The Guanghua Bookstore on Fourth Ma Road announces that it has recently published 15 new books in one month. The authors and translators are all famous novelists or writers, so several books have been selected by schools in various provinces as textbooks, which are highly praised. Recently, to benefit readers, all books, both local and foreign editions, will be sold at reduced prices for 20 days, starting yesterday.</p>
<p>The Daguang Company at 9 Hankou Road announces that its manager, Mr. Song Zijiang, has recently invented an automatic copier with a delicate structure, flexible operation, and low price. It can be called a good product among domestic goods.</p>
<p>The Sanfeng Company at 20 Museum Road announces that since the company began manufacturing domestic athletic undershirts last year, many large stores in various provinces and this port have been purchasing from the company, such as Sincere, Wing On, Commercial Press, China General Agency, and more than ten others, which are all selling them. There are also distributors in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Beijing, Tianjin, Nanchang, and other places. The company's products are of excellent quality and low prices. With the soaring gold prices and the resulting high prices of foreign goods, the company anticipates that sales this year will definitely be wider, so it has added more inventory to meet market demand.</p>
<p>The Ford Motor Company announces the grand opening ceremony of its new branch factory in Long Beach, California. This factory can be reached by waterway and railway, further integrating the company's various factories. This branch factory is designed to supply Southern California with Ford automobiles and trucks, and can produce 400 vehicles per day, which is far more than the now-closed Los Angeles branch factory, which could only produce 225 vehicles. The automobiles and trucks used by the company's new factory are transported from the Ford factories in Edgewater and Chester, using its own ships, through the Panama Canal, to Long Beach Port. There is a tunnel there that leads directly to the warehouse, where the vehicles are unloaded. From the time the ship docks to the time the car is manufactured, there is no wasted labor. The cranes, carriers, and machines used are far more effective than human labor. The Edgewater area is constructing a branch factory near the sea, and branch factories are also planned for Richmond and Seattle near the waterways.</p>

<p>The Five Star Film Company announces that its first production was originally planned to start shooting earlier.

"Exploring Linglong" will definitely be in the second production, and the second production will start filming around the 18th of this month.</p>
<p>The Wenge Bookstore at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Laobazi Road frankly states that the "Drunken Butterflies Among Flowers" photos are a new product newly shipped from the United States by the Lianyi Photo Company, exclusively managed and sold by this bookstore. Since the Nanjing Grand Theater screened this film, countless copies have been sold. There are very few in stock now, so purchasers should hurry. Those who admire the movie queen Janet Gaynor and the movie emperor Charles Farrell should not miss this opportunity. For mail orders, please include 10 cents per photo and send it to Mr. Yang Baidi, manager of Lianyi Photo Company, care of Tianya Painting Studio, 45 Baoshan Lane, Bin Tong Road, Zhabei.</p>
<p>The Star Film Company announces that after recently filming the entire fourteenth episode of "Burning the Red Lotus Temple," Zhang Youchuan will supervise a full team of talented actors, cameramen, scene designers, artists, etc., to continue filming the fifteenth episode of "Red Lotus Temple."

In the future, audiences who love "Red Lotus Temple" will have a fresh experience.</p>
<p>The National Grand Theater on Zhaopu Road and Haining Road announces that it will screen the unprecedentedly funny love film, "Two Heroes Compete for Beauty," starring the world-famous "Tall and Skinny" and "Little Dwarf" starting tomorrow. It will once again be a chaotic and crowded scene.</p>
<p>The Xifan Film Company announces that it is currently working hard to film a Qing Dynasty swordsman martial arts film, "Golden Rooster Ridge," which can be called the most successful great production of this year. The interior scenes have already been completed, and next week they will go to Ningbo to shoot exterior scenes. This film is very promising and can win glory for domestic films.</p>
<p>The Great China Film Company announces that the first night of the premiere of its historical epic "Stone Princess" and the added performance of the Amorous song and dance drama "Crab Shell Beauty" at the Central Grand Theater was sold out before 9 o'clock, so that later arrivals could not squeeze in. However, many people insisted on seeing it, causing the ticket collectors to have difficulty maintaining order and causing some chaos. Fortunately, the theater staff maintained order effectively, avoiding any problems. Now the company sees that this drama truly has the power to move stones, so today it has specially appointed company staff and actors Tang Yunqing, Gu Xiaowo, etc., to serve as temporary receptionists to better serve the audience.</p>

<p>The Beiping Lü Gongwang Writing and Fixed-Price General Receiving Office announces that Major General Lü Gongwang of Beiping's calligraphy has never been advertised for low prices since he was in Shanghai, but he is highly respected by all walks of life because it is rare to find a military man who is proficient in calligraphy. Recently, to assist with a certain charity event, a month-long fan-giving event was held. Taking advantage of this good opportunity, various ports inside and outside have requested screen couplets. Due to many requests, it was previously announced that the low prices would continue with an 80% discount on the gold standard. Therefore, the number of pieces in the past few days has been extremely large, and it is feared that the quota will soon be full again. Only those who are quick will get there first.</p>
<p>The Changming Art College announces that the number of students in each grade of the school in the previous semester was very small. However, since the principal Wang Yiting and all the professors were able to provide good guidance, the achievement exhibition held at the end of the semester was brilliant and well-received by public opinion. The number of students increased greatly during the summer class. The number of students actually attending this semester has also increased several times compared to the return semester. The school started classes yesterday. At 10 a.m., a supplementary commencement ceremony was held, and the ceremonies were performed as usual. Principal Wang first gave a speech, briefly stating that painting emphasizes skill and, more importantly, spirituality. Then, professors Wang, Wang, Song, and others gave speeches one after another. After the speeches, Principal Wang went to the podium again to discuss the relationship between Chinese and Western painting, as well as mutual reference and assistance. After the ceremony, Principal Wang went downstairs and painted a large-scale "Pine and Crane" painting on a whim, and provided painting methods at any time. Male and female students, looking up and surrounding the scene, were all happily delighted.</p>
