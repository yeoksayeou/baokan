<h3>倫敦海會之眞相</h3>
<p>世界各國至今日。人人深懼戰禍人人皆不肯先自去戰。故不欲戰者。世界人心所同也。不欲戰而求縮减其軍備者。亦各國之誠意也。蓋自歐洲大戰之後。各國無不創巨痛深。其不欲戰一也。及今民力之凋殘。商業之衰敗。重負軍備之財力。又各有所不及。故不欲戰而又誠心以求縮减軍備二也。惟不易成功者。咸欲他人之先我而縮减。使已國不至有被略侵之虞即或不然。亦必他國之縮减。與我同時。與我同等。使已國無縮减之後患。决無一國。毅然决然。不問他國之如何。先就已國不可少之國防。作大規模之縮减。以爲各國倡。蓋懷疑之心未除。自信之心因之不足。雖亦各自竭力。然皆勉强而行之者也。日本之回訓。容納美案。而加以保留。國人起而反對者。恐有碍於國防也。法國之軍縮。必須要求國家之保障。亦恐被人侵掠也。蓋人與人間。即國家與國家間。信義不能相孚。而惟求武力以自保。則欲縮减軍備。誠非易事。况此軍備雄厚之國家。其財力尙不至於無可措置。則必盡其能力。以維現狀。故軍備之不能縮减。在各國亦未必非勉强而行之者也。</p>

<h3>中國逐漸采行金本位</h3>
<p>幣制法草案提要（三）（續）　　舊幣之撤銷</p>
<p>用金本位貨幣替代現行貨幣之任務、乃委於全國幣制委員會、其委員長則以幣制處處長充之、在必要時更設各省幣制委員會以輔助之、省幣制委員會之任務、尤注重於曉諭民衆以新幣制之利益、使有舊貨幣之處罰及限制、與夫以舊貨幣換新貨幣之地點及官定率、　　舊紙幣之撤銷、　　設計委員會對於改組中央銀行爲中央準備銀行所擬之草案、乃規定紙幣發行須由此計劃中之新中央準備銀行獨佔、是以本草案在設法將現今流通之各種紙幣收回、俟本草案成爲法律時、則各省各地方各銀行（除中央銀行外）、商店、或私人所發行之紙幣、均應停止發行、並採取迅速方法、將其撤回、每省之紙幣最後收回日、不能較債務換算日爲早、且至少在一年以前公布、在此日以前所有紙幣、應按照平價收回、惟紙幣跌價過低、及經過若干時尙如是者、則規定其可在某種條件之下、依財政部長所决定之率、以低於額面之價格兌回之、　　如一省或地方、或省銀行、或地方銀行、在該日期以前不能收回、其所有之紙幣、則須以充分金本位貨幣存於特定代理處、、而以平價收回其流通差額、如不能備有充分之貨幣以作此用、可改用有利息之債劵以撤回其未收回之紙幣、　　如一銀行或他種私人組織有紙幣在外流通、而在紙幣最後收回日以前、不能盡行收回者、則此等未收回之紙幣、須課之以稅、在第一年中每月以半厘爲率、第二年每月爲一厘、此後則每月爲一厘半、由國民政府欠有鉅欵之銀行、其所有未收回紙幣與其所持國民政府債劵相等之部分得减免四分之三之稅、債劵已由政府償付、或由銀行售出後、則其免稅部分之紙幣須隨之减少、在紙幣最後收回日以前、政府須將其對於銀行之無基金負債額、用現欵或用各類債劵償淸之、</p>
<h3>銀本位建議案之缺點</h3>
<p>設計委員會曾對於以銀爲基礎將全國通貨統一然後改用金爲基礎之建議計畫加以研究、據委員會之意見、此種建議、因下述之種種原因、而有重大之錯誤、在統一幣制之困難事業完成後、而欲進　行以金爲基礎、及規定銀幣之實値與面値之必要差額、勢不能不將銀幣之面値提高、然在金本位中銀幣之實値、通常須等於、銀幣之面値三分之二、此種將國内通貨相對减少之辦法、誠爲一種痛苦之舉、可使工業及輸出貿易蕭條、勞働界受害、而對於某某階級、亦極不公平、如將來改鑄信用金本位貨幣、以代提高銀幣之價値、則國家須收回其新發行、之銀本位貨幣、而遭兩重之損失、且使人民亦感不便、殊無謂也、　　且用此種間接方法進行以金爲基礎之計劃、是使國家繼續舉行二次幣制改革、以銀爲基礎之幣制統一後、不久又須進　行以金爲基礎之第二次改革、此種改革、無論如何、荆棘滋多、且此種間接計劃在第一次改革業已告竣後、如於第二次改革時遇有重大反對、則采用以金爲基礎之舉、將不易實現、　　間接方法尙有一重大缺點即爲政府所有鉅額造幣權利益之損失、將銀本位貨幣之價値提高使其適合於金本位制後、則此等貨幣乃成爲信用貨幣、但其可以歸於政府之造幣權利益、乃消散於私人之手、而不復爲政府所有、此等利益大都爲投機者所得、彼等在此時期内、最爲活動、一九○五年及一九○六年海峽殖民地因採用此種幣制改革所受關於此點之經騐、可予我人以一種有價値之敎訓、　　間接計畫遲早須舉鉅額借欵、以設立必需之金貨準備金、反之、直接計畫除創始時所需小額借欵外、確能自給、且其借欵亦可以此次改革本身所得之利益償淸之、間接計畫又虚耗時日、使中國非經過許多年後不能享受現今幾爲一切其他重要國家所享受之金本位利益、　　統一之金本位通貨爲中國工商業重大之助力、可使生產增加、國外貿易發達、全國人民之幸福增進　、而直接採用金本位之方法、又最爲經濟、對於國内實業妨害最少、且其最大之利益、則爲可使中國在較進步之區域内、立即采行金本位、</p>

<p>複賽　　天津勝上海　　結果四與一之比　　明日與香港决賽　　昨日下午二時、上海天津棒球複賽、裁判張信孚、樂秀榮、雙方健兒、原係一時之選、際茲緊要關健、各以全力對付、以冀達决賽位置、獲大會錦標、滬　名將劉達成盧觀祥均專車趕至、而天津好手、則每日在塲操練、雙方準備之周密、有如此者、屆時棒球塲中、參觀者百餘人、歷觀各局奮鬥之經過、各有相當之貢獻、而第一第六兩幕、尤多精彩、第一幕上海首開紀綠、獲得一分、第六幕天津一鼓作氣、反敗爲勝、結果天津以四比一獲勝、得决賽權、明日下午二時、天津將與香港决賽、屆時兩雄並峙、必有一番劇戰也、是日天津投手林錫泙、接手顧得剛、上海投手安樂生、接手劉達成、兩隊投手、天津臂力健强、始終不懈、上海初亦良佳、以後忽意志不定、出球乏力、以接手諭、劉達成較爲老練多矣、</p>
<h3>上海首開紀綠</h3>
<p>上海曾廣邦第一擊球占得一壘、陳虞添繼之、曾廣邦乘機偷壘、一再成功、待盧觀祥輪擊時、全塲注目、蓋獲分與否即在盧之手腕、盧用力擊出、高飛天空、落向塲之左邊處、球爲憑朝亮所得、待投回接手時、曾已安然抵壘、獲得一分、上海乃首開紀綠、</p>
<h3>雙方堅壁相持</h3>
<p>自第二局起、至第五局止、雙方投手、各出絕技、擊者少有進展之機會、偶而登得一二壘、不久亦被迫下塲、雙方堅壁相持、不得越雷池一步矣、</p>
<h3>天津反敗爲勝</h3>
<p>第六局上海下塲、輪及天津擊球、斯時將近完畢、稍一失手、有關大局、二隊戰戰競競、全神注視、天津馮朝亮一擊成功、獲登一壘、自此精神百倍、努力進取、長驅直入、如入無人之境、上海錯誤累見、陣線混亂、益有江河日下之勢、天津先後歸壘者馮朝亮·鮑文沛·林榮彬·林錫泙·四</p>
<p>人、最後一局（即第七局）上海力求恢復、軍心不壯、首先二人、失利而退、盧雖登占二壘、卒至功虧一簣、結果天津以四比一占勝、　　千六百米替換劉長春待發情形　　林澤人攝</p>

<h3>男子排球</h3>
<p>次賽兩組香港克上海　　···結果二比○　　二隊表演臻化境　　三千觀衆嘆奇觀　　六日下午一時、港滬二隊舉行排球奪標次賽、爲一週來比賽中最精彩之一幕、蓋一係華南冠軍、久執東亞之牛耳、一爲滬上雄主、夙負盛名於全國、一旦相遇一堂、各懷奪標之决心、其角遷爭　　男子替換跑換手時情形　林澤人攝</p>
<p>競之烈、固不待臨陣交鋒始可預測也、下午三刻、記者入塲、祗見東西看臺、满坑满谷、人多如蟻、南北圈外、環立者五六層、翹首引領、惟恐落後排球比賽、而有如此偉大號召之能力、維前次在滬舉行之第八屆運動會亦無以過之、藝術感人之深、一至於此、吾不禁爲中國體育前途賀也、</p>
<h3>開始比賽前之盛况</h3>
<p>將及一時、二隊戎装入塲、香港隊員紅背心、紮絨褲、鮮艷奪目、滬隊紮背心藍褲、更覺孄雅、各報攝影師、爭先拍照、一若預知此幕爲錦標關鍵之所繫也、作數度緩和練習後、裁判員一聲令下、此一幕極彩極神化之排球戰、遂於數千觀衆觀呼聲中開始矣、</p>
<h3>兩雄相遇勢均力敵</h3>
<p>二隊隊員、均係個中名宿、實力不相伯仲、故開賽之際、彼此各懷戒懼、不敢疏忽、港先發球、首遭失敗、上海繼之、亦無所獲、港曾經全再發、得一分、先開紀綠、旋滬亦得一分、成相平之局、此時競爭極烈、前鋒躍起還擊、後衛蹲伏以待、宛如生龍活虎、球則盤旋網之左右、忽南忽北、誠屬奇觀、而港隊亦從此遂漸進展、以六比四佔先、</p>
<h3>力挽狂瀾滬隊反攻</h3>
<p>滬隊見對方來勢兇猛、知非力戰不足抵禦、乃會精聚神、竭力抬架、形勢頓轉、港隊兩次發球、均難得逞、滬則從中、增得一分、成五與六之比例、</p>
<h3>出奇制勝香港奏功</h3>
<p>香港累攻無效、乃變更方略、用兩翼包抄之計、中軍祗顧接應、常將球託至兩邊、中排左右翼、則猛力壓擊球落之點、疾如射箭、均在滬方之左右塲角、忽左忽右、屢中要害、滬隊捉摸不定、顧此失彼、眞是彼不勝防、守亦難守、港則一順風舫紡、得有十一比五之勝勢、</p>
<h3>易陣地後再接再厲</h3>
<p>易陣以後、港隊節節勝利、三次發球、又進三分、滬隊經此痛創之下、全隊更加激憤、併力向前爭取、果亦先後增得四分、而造成十四比九之局面、女田徑錦標哈粵並列第一</p>
<h3>前得分數一槪取銷</h3>
<p>賽跑糾紛圓满解决　　替換賽跑···粵不出塲···哈不肯待···</p>
<p>何應欽等···調定停賽···雙方同意</p>
<p>女子二百米替換賽糾紛、東特已允重賽、不料到時、東特四選手出塲、等候許久、粵隊未至、裁判長報告再延期、東特遂大反對、爭執頗久、經何應欽戴季陶朱家驊等調停、議决不再賽、女田徑錦標、東特與粵並列第一、以前分數取消不計、雙方同意、圓满解决、</p>
<h3>港陳錫炳厥功甚偉</h3>
<p>當此雙方相持不下之際、港隊陳錫炳奮勇襲擊、那壓球功夫、可稱獨步、屢屢其神速高壓之絕藝、向對方攻打、而其所擊之球、或能隨心應手馬到功成、滬方從未有能挽救者、是誠奇人奇技也、據請　排球之專家某君云、陳君非特爲香港</p>
<p>隊之魂靈、且爲東亞之第一把手、記者目覩其技　　女子二百米替換東特組自右而左王淵劉靜貞吳梅仙、孫桂雲　　林澤人攝術之高深、信不誣也、以後港隊愈戰愈勇、迨陳錫炳發球時、即以二十一比十四、勝第一局</p>
<h3>再戰中滬勢轉機</h3>
<p>休息數分鐘、整隊績戰、滬隊抖搜精神、球勢大見轉機、先以四對三領先、繼又成七比三之局是時觀衆心理、咸以爲上海有轉勝之望、不意戰局變幻莫測、港隊雖小受頓挫、仍舊態度從容、陣綫更顯鞏固、乘𨻶而攻、未嘗一失、未幾反以十七比十四轉勝、此後滬隊漸覺不安、雖勇將如曹妊將李信標、亦一籌莫展、坐令對方進攻、幾失還手之力、誠以棋高一着、手足難措、此實力之不如、非戰之罪也、</p>
<h3>港奮勇卒獲勝利</h3>
<p>再數合後、港勢愈盛、分數又激增不已、又以二十一比十四勝連勝兩局、得獲賽權　、裁判員譚天沛、兩隊陣綫如左、</p>

<h3>次賽南京勝北平</h3>
<p>二與○之比　　南京球　藝佳　　男排球次賽、南京勝北平、二比零、在比賽秩序中、原定初賽、北平對河南、京輪空因河南未到、北平逐得次賽權、六日下午三時、二隊交鋒於排球塲，南京隊員全屬粵閩籍、對於此種球戲、頗具根底、北平隊經騐較淺、聯絡欠周、第一局表演、平淡毫無精彩、寗以二十一比四勝第二局、平隊略見起色、然力不逮、終難與相抗、又以十二比二一敗北、結果二對零、寗勝、裁判員高錫感、</p>

<h3>男子籃球次賽北平勝浙江</h3>
<p>七十五對二十四　　北平初次出馬　　此次籃球錦賽加入者共二十隊、其中以天津·上海·北平·神户·遼寗等隊爲最强、北平本排定初賽中與湖南比賽、湖南缺席、故今日之戰、尚爲第一次出馬、該隊蜚聲平津、實力不弱、大有攫取錦標之野心、</p>
<h3>浙江球藝不弱</h3>
<p>浙江初賽以六十二對二十六勝綏遠、二週賽中又以三十六對十五戰勝安徽、察其成績、亦非可輕視、兩隊旗鼓相當、預料競爭必烈、觀者雲集、座爲之满、而尤以軍界爲多、片片黃色、煞是好看、</p>
<h3>上半時平獲勝</h3>
<p>裁判錢一勤檢察劉耀堃、鐘指一下、劇戰始啟、北平中鋒王玉增拍球與陳盛奎、陳不稍停留、急傳與左鋒趙伯榮、趙見機會極佳、速向籃圈擲去*</p>
<p>满望能開紀綠、不料此球在鐡圈稍打個灣、即向旁邊墮下、浙江接得、即反攻投籃亦不中、相持約七分鐘、記分板上尙無數目、後浙江得罰球機會、中鋒周作民主罰得一分、北平見浙江佔先、各人抖擻精神、勇往直前、陳盛奎連連中得、王玉增又連中三元、分數頻增、浙江乃調姚良爲左鋒、姚顧矯健、加入即連進二球、北平趙伯榮帶球進攻、單槍匹馬、長驅直入、投籃不中、王利其高大身材、連拍三拍、滾入網中、上半時結果、爲二十七對五、北平勝、</p>
<h3>浙江無法挽回</h3>
<p>下半時浙江又先得勝、北平何肯放鬆、多用空中傳遞、其高長身軀、佔得便宜不少、浙江傳球滯呆、吳國霖投籃頗有準的、奈無連手、搭擋祗能望籃興嘆、北平自趙伯榮連獲十分後、氣𦦨之盛、有如火上加油、不可逈彌、得分之多、與時俱進、浙江陣線漸見紊亂、軍心搖動、致不可收拾、結果遂以七十五與二十四之比而失敗、</p>

<h3>鄂渚珍羞</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>武昌鯉膾</p>
<p>曩讀東坡詩。詠「長江繞郭知魚美。」</p>
<p>近時名人亦有「酒樽重話武昌魚」</p>
<p>之句。僕頗嗜魚。嘗欲一嘗風味而無由。今春窜游鄂省。偕數友登黃鶴樓。遠眺長江。天水一色。新柳藏鴉。漁舟唱晚。和風送暖。景物宜人。因與友會飲酒家。以遣游興。席間。羅列白蛤靑螺。早韭新笋。味皆適口。繼進鯉膾一盤。肥嫩鮮美。遠勝鷄豚。擬之河豚石首。覺亦。乎其後。始信昔人題賞之非謬也。於是添膾更酌。夕陽欲瞑。旣醉而歸。飲時詢之酒家侍者。據以長江浩渺。水性活潑。魚味皆美。而鯉稱最優。更須在黃鹤樓下。漁人網得其目作硃紅色者爲診。蓋以襄漢之水。急湍洪濤。奔騰直下、至黃鶴磯邊。始漸平恬。魚得休息。味始特美。而或於他處網得者。雖肥不嫩。雖嫩肥。未能並皆佳妙云。</p>
<p>漢臯紫莧</p>
<p>漢臯第城馬路之東。昔曰「瀟湘湖」。亦名「黃花地」。近者鄂渚上游。高堤阻遏。滄海盡爲桑田。澤國驟成華屋。乃市肆雖繁。原野尙廣。田父園叟之藉春韭。秋菘。紫菱。銀藕以爲業者。比比然也。地肥土沃。圃蔬繁植。有紫莧者。汁若胭脂。嫣紅可愛。味同春筍。脆嫩過之。爲該地特產。顧肩販之在街市求售者。皆係他處所產。全屬贋鼎。故購者必至產處。向灌園人。就菜畦採擷者。斯爲佳品。當夫夕陽欲下時。草繫筐貯。提挈以歸者。接踵不絕。漢俗於立夏節日。家家餚饌。必進斯菜。以應節令。正與端午之蒲觴彷彿也。</p>
<h3>梅園修禊記</h3>
<p>— 剕夢蝶</p>
<p>庚上午已。老友謝介子翩然來自海上。蓋梁溪之别一載矣。相見甚喜。君携贈梅園主人畫梅一幀。爲其兄公展畫幹。夫人時敏着花。題句則介子自書舊作五湖探梅賦。美具難并。可云三絕。時舊友百熙條甫亦來。相與展賞久之。因念隔歲之春。與瘦鵑諸友月下賞梅勝事。如在目前。今則梅花落盡。已成盡中愛寵。猶幸夭桃正放。綠葉未成陰。且喜前度劉郎。不作遲來杜牧也。主人德公以佳客遠來。適値古人修禊良辰。遂欣然邀介子及余等游園、乘汽車往。瞬息已至。園中一路桃花。昨日之香雪海。頓改赤城霞矣。天心台下。曲池之濱。亭亭數株。嬌艷尤絕。依稀若耶西子。臨流浣紗。照影沈魚光景也。其後復有白桃一樹。花開特盛　。晶瑩姿態。玉雪照人。息夫人無言相對。已足銷魂。介子不覺朗誦余詩「虢國偏能」</p>
<p>誇素面。文君何忍着紅裳」之句焉。更有一種各「花桃」者每朶花中。紅白相間。粉臉脂痕。如點絳唇之美人。亦奇觀也。誦豳堂前。邂逅周君寄湄。此公亦舊相識。詼諧多趣。得之大足爲斯游助興。啜茗小憩。旋偕往讀書處。唔朱夢華君。圖書满室。名家畫譜碑帖。披覽不盡。最名貴者。有周寄老携來之二泉山人墨蹟。看花兼此。客之眼福不淺哉。室縣古琴一張。夢華指謂太湖飯店一茶房所贈。客相訝厮養胡風雅至是。余笑曰。此所謂金陵賣菜傭。都帶六朝烟水氣者也。夕陽旣墜。即開樽於太湖飯店。入席主客。適符竹林人數。寄老身歷戎行。席間暢談戰陣苦况。及軍閥失敗史。慷慨悲凉。有聲有色。四座聆之。如讀漢書。爲絕妙下酒物也。席終客散。已星斗满天。人影在地。則吾儕今日之游。不第武蘭亭古事。又如何謫仙之春夜宴桃李園已。是烏可以不紀。</p>
<h3>參歡王綱個人圖案展覽會</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>海上舉行展覽會者多矣。而從無專以圖案展覽者。有之。其王君綱之個人圖案展覽便乎。圖案之重要。國人雖知之。多忽而不知重視。坐視工業窳敗。商業頽靡。不知從根本解决。徒咨嗟外貨之充斥。而忘國貨之粗糙無美術思想。不足以引起購買者之興趣。故提倡國貨之言。雖甚囂塵上。而終無補也。王君綱昔嘗學*</p>
<p>圖案於北京美專。固已有異於人。後赴東京專攻圖案。不見六七年。今忽開個人圖案展覽會於寗波同鄉會。開海上覽展會之新紀元。將來斯道發達。此會其濫觴也。烏可不紀。且余亦嘗究心此道。所著圖案法。久已印行問世。故聞有此會。大有空谷足音之概。會中陳列。各種圖案俱满。約一百五十餘幅。其構圖之精妙。設色之富麗。思想之奇特。調子之諧和。能</p>
<p>使觀者自起一種温雅愉快之感情。且能合中國西洋日本三派之所長而治爲一爐。更爲難能可貴。中國學圖案者全國尙不满十人。其人率與余有舊。如王君者。誠後起之秀。可謂突過前賢者矣。故樂爲介紹於國人焉。會期至七月止。有志斯道者及工業家商業家。均不可不往觀。以廣眼界也。（不受酬）</p>
<h3>賞櫻聞鶴記</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>予晨起殊早。散步坰野間。日行二三里以爲常。附近有六三園者。尤爲予所憩息之地。蓋煎炙塵氛。不可不藉此以吐氣耳。園有櫻。都數十株。高皆尋丈。枚枒立於阜石中。厥境淸絕入畫。日來櫻已著花。花五出如梅。色淺紅。含苞者更爲濃艷。彷彿二八妇女郎。春情微逗。對之使人魂銷。花或疏或密。自遠望之。霞蔚雲蒸不啻也。徘徊其下。辦有因風飄着襟袂者。更爲韻絕。而橋左蓄白鶴二。立水流中。自刷其翩。偶然唳呌。聲悠然以長。此古人所以有嗚臯聞天之說歟。園中多倭人之居。有松三次郎者。能操漢語。頗</p>
<p>與予善。謂吳老缶生前嘗蒞此。見雙鶴而愛之。立染毫圖其形。丹頂素翎。雲飛欲舞。閒放超遠之意。盎然紙上。是畫今尙存笥篋。而老缶已歸道山。展玩之餘。未免愴然興感云。</p>

<h3>綴玉軒遊美雜錄</h3>
<p>— 來</p>
<p>自睕華在此演秦以來。此間評劇家演劇家寫劇家歌唱家音樂家劇塲經理等等日日來觀不厭。并於散劇後親到後台面述其意見及其感想。有一寫劇家曾云。梅君之劇。舉止動作。處處皆有定律。且有準確地方。實較美國戲劇高出數倍。人云中國劇係陳舊的。然以藝術的眼光觀察之。實較美國之新者還新。此後美國劇必受極大影響。或將一變其作風。蓋無疑義也。又劇界公會會長云。此間尙有許多各劇塲之演劇者歌唱者以及音樂家。渴想梅君之劇。而苦於無暇往觀者。因皆於同時演戲故也。因此頗希望梅君於星期四加演日戲一天。則劇界同人皆得一饜視聽之欲。蓋星期三星期六梅君雖有日戲。而彼等亦有日戲。仍無暇分身也。（此事大致須答應）又有云汾河灣最好。人人可懂者。有支舞劍姿勢最佳者。有云剌刺虎實爲最好之劇者。有云中國劇實與希臉劇相似者。有云中劇之規定極妙者。譬如到相當時間。觀者意以爲此時應唱。而台上竟已唱矣。愜心貴當莫逾於此。衆論紛紜。不遑備述。雖不無溢美之辭。然確多見地晤語也。</p>
<p>開演之始。有極大商店數家來商請以畹華之行頭。展列於其肆内。以爲陳飾。現已陳列數處。參觀者異常擁擠。近日連有大劇塲數處柬請參觀。招待極爲殷勤。昨日曾有製影片家來院拍新聞電影。僅拍刺剌虎之一段。聞明日即可試映。晚間將全體前往參觀。并聞新片於三日内即可遍達全國矣。昨試排春香鬧學。以備將來更改劇目時之用。醉酒及木蘭從軍亦須一演。太眞外傳或亦將重編試演之。</p>
<h3>常識拾零</h3>
<p>— 湯筆花</p>
<p>葫蘆式帶着電線電燈開關。切勿装在鐡床裏面。要防電線壞了和鐡床接觸。很容易使睡在床上的觸電。多麽危險。這是從經騐中得來的常識。　　寒暑表切勿掛在近日光的地方。因爲冷熱不匀。度數也因此不準確了。　　小孩打呃。頻頻不休。可設法使其哭泣。那麽呃即停止。　　身帶銀錢。中途遇見歹人釘梢。只要向站崗巡捕問一條路名。那麽歹人見了。以爲你去報告巡捕。也就退避三舍了。</p>

<p>是陸君扶這班人。。都不願意在那種不三不四的戲臺上去表演。。上海那時的新劇。。第一是不讀脚本。。第二是不分幕數。。從來分不出幾幕幾幕。。幕内在佈景。。幕外還是在做戲。。其次像那燈光之類。。都不考究。。那包廂裏正廳上都是穿來穿去的賣糖食水果的小販。。常常遮蔽了觀衆的視線。。因爲有許多人。。在觀劇的當兒。。嘴裏也不肯空閑。。常是要嚼食甜的鹹的各種東西。。尤其是劇場中的聲浪雜作。。不是老頭子的咳嗽聲。。便是小孩子的啻哭聲。。那種新劇。。最討厭的是稱之爲文明戲。。不知是誰定下這個文明兩字。。而那班唱戲的。。也自以爲是改良社會。。算是高等職業。。所謂文明戲。。野蠻戲。。誰也不能立下這個界說。。他們那時倒也不必要什麽廣大的劇塲。。只要可以坐得下四五百人也就殼了。。不在乎觀衆的人多。。却在乎觀衆的整齊。。不要喧嘩嘈雜要。。他們自然也要售票。。可以收回來一些費用。。但是他們究竟和專事營業的劇團不同。。他們是有一種研究性質持。。預備大家貼去幾個錢。。不過那個戲臺。。倒要是新式的。。寗可小一些倒不妨。。一切佈景和揭幕垂幕。。都要設備完全。。後來居然被他們覔到了一個地方。。却是個賣外國樂器及鋼琴的洋行。。喚做謀得利洋行。。這謀得利洋行裏面。。倒有一個小劇塲。。原來他們的職業。。都和音樂家有關係。。音樂家又和戲劇家有關係。。有許多僑寓上海的音樂家。。都借那個地方開音樂會跳舞會。。還有一種歌劇。。却不是那種大規模的演劇。。小小的劇塲。。有那們三四百位的觀衆。。倒也很好。。至於戲臺上的佈景。。普通的也有。。偶然要特别的。。那非得自製不可。。他們也可以給你介紹製佈景的工師。。好在借他那個地方。。演幾天戲。。價錢也還算便宜。。陸君扶我到了那個地方。甚爲得意。。便和他們訂立合同。。佈景不夠的。。便自已製一場佈景出來。因爲那齣不如歸一共只有五幕。。其中有一兩幕佈景相同的。。其餘所添的佈景也有限。。他們的演戲。。也是只重在表演。。不重在佈景。。到了籌備好了。。便選定了日子。。就開演了。。因爲陸君扶和左詩晨是認得的。。常常到他的報館裏來談天。。好像是把他做顧問一般。。對於新派劇的討論。。尤其是陸君扶最高興的事。。</p>

<h3>十八年在華日紗廠之進展</h3>

<h3>上週紗價被外紗帶高</h3>
<p>紗市在週初趨勢頗衰、且跌風愈銳、蓋以三月份多頭無意收貨、於是賣方壓迫愈力、且數千包現貨、均在空方手中、故在週初市氣惡劣、時局又見緊張、散户發現恐惶之狀、客銷視大勢不佳、皆朿手不前、故標準期紗最低本月一百四十七兩八錢、五月份一百四十八兩三錢、當時商塲上須看四十五兩、詎料美棉上涨、東洋三品紗亦上涨、買方心氣較爲一振、某廠商之買方、星期二在本月份、限價一百四十九兩、大批收進、一日間購進二三千包、同時雲南帮發展、購進十支紗三千餘包、人心被其激動、市勢立定、星期三四近月又有一大户、購進五六千包、於是形勢尤硬、近日曾見一百五十一兩八錢、星期五六因春假停市、紗市被買方一撑、暫時不致大跌、然時局風雲緊急、前途尙難鞏固也、結果標紗各月份比上週涨二兩外、全週成交統計六萬九千六百五十包、客帮中雲南牛莊廣東三帮買去最多、各帮買去統計九千九百九十包、同行中進一千八百五十包、茲將各帮買額錄左、</p>

<h3>糧食河下粳米連日呆疲</h3>
<p>閘北　昨前兩日米情、各貨微有不同、到貨共計五十餘號、市銷甚呆、尤以北粳爲最、但市中頂粳米似乎凋零、故得勉維二十元之限盤、如中關普通則買户沉寂、價削一兩角不等、惟昨市則視賣方之手腕而定、因亦有未跌者、觀察市形、粳米頗形呆疲、薄稻去路甚滯、行情因此不振、逐步剝削、高貨祗在十八元七角左右、羊杜秈河貨枯薄、來貨旣屬不旺、產市亦仍穩定、故本埠走銷雖極麻木、然價則依然平定、祗色次之貨略批降耳、客埠秈完全受洋米軋脚、是以零折不甚爽化、大盤因到稀站立、變元陰化到銷兩平、均鮮榮辱、</p>
<p>滬南　河下來船自天晴後微接、各方進意暢滯不一、常鍚機粳有本街酌動、但北市疲弱後、價格異常吃緊、故市盤無形中别去角譜、蘇同</p>
<p>白粳來貨稍有、鄉莊胃口寥寥、行情高貨微修、中次見軟角許、南帮薄稻及四鄉早稻客帮銷塲滯鈍、且選擇旣嚴、挑剔尤密、情况因此不振、高次一律下游、羊秈此間存到兩稀、買户觀望、市價平淡、杜子秈與客機尖銷化較活、店胃尙屬殷</p>
<p>動、盤面仍平穩、通變陰元吊銷活絡、來貨稀少、賣主因此扳售、價格見緊角外、查南北各市在此兩日無甚變化、兼近日米糧平價委員會成立、往後米情恐不易上涨耳、</p>

<h3>會勘俞塘詳紀</h3>
<p>上海縣建設局長吳文華、偕同二三各區長、及地方士紳、分日履勘俞塘、昨始告竣、共計水程廿七里有奇、此次疏浚俞塘、地方民衆、非常注意、茲將連日履勘情形及疏浚方略、詳誌于後、</p>
<p>河身淤塞情形、自黃浦入口處、至俞塘橋止、約一里左右、河道尙寬、水流亦暢、可毌庸開浚、自俞塘橋至新森橋止、計長二里左右、河流曲折、成一弧形、俗稱北灣、最爲淤塞、查俞塘橋東南、距俞塘約二百尺左右、有一支流、名金家河、直西流至新木橋、入俞塘、全長約半里强、如將此河不距俞塘之二百尺并浚、而將北灣塡没、不特水力較强、可减淤塞之弊、即塡没北灣之地、亦可增加公產、旣于農田水利、兩無妨碍、且可减省工程、故此段擬行改道、自新木橋以下至語兒、涇、淤塞情形、大致相同、均非大加疏浚不可、惟自北橋至語兒涇兩邊河岸特高、須先開挖、使與北橋以上邊岸高度均衡、然後開浚時、運泥來往、方無上下不便之病、惟全河寬度、僅爲四丈、殊嫌過狹、如將來交通計、河面非拓寬至六丈不爲功、顧河身在平野間開拓、尙多經過鎭市之處、沿河每多市房、均須一律拆除、以利水運、查塘灣房屋不多、北橋方面、南岸有發展餘地、均尚易于爲力、惟馬橋鎭兩岸、均有房屋、實行拓寬、必須拆讓、凡此改道開挖遷屋諸端、均須預行規劃、以免阻碍工程、深望下屆委員會、能有具體之决定、</p>
<p>沿河橋梁狀况　俞塘自黃浦　入口處、至語兒涇止、所經橋梁、凡廿一座、爲俞塘橋、新木橋、楊家灣橋、莫家橋、西唐灣橋、草菴橋、汽車路橋、嗚鶴橋、姚院橋、潘家木橋、壇橋、楊家木橋、新橋、穀家橋、廟橋、新石橋、盛家橋、淸河橋、新木橋、吳家巷橋等、其中木橋佔十座、破壞不堪、行人危險、均須加以修理、且河身放寬以後、更有改建之必要、惟經費有限、勢難盡如人意、將來亦祗可視財力如何、再定辦法耳、石橋亦佔十座、尙能應用、惟加寬浚深以後、水流較急、亦必須加以修理、方能可保永久、水泥鋼骨橋一座、係四十尺拱形橋、爲滬閔南柘汽車公司所建、尙屬堅固可用、</p>
<p>築壩戽水工程　開浚以前、各支流處、均須築壩、查黃浦、俞塘橋、新木橋、黃</p>
<p>涇、竹港、沙港、語兒涇等七處、河流開闊、壩工較大、期其餘小壩雖多、施工尙易、至壩工估計、須俟實測以後、再行計算、壩工完竣後、更須戽盡河中積水、以便開挖、惟此項戽水工程至難、預計以河中積水數量估計、已難準確、而戽水之時、或遇天雨、河中積水、必形暴涨、加以潛水暗潮、時有侵入、更足影響預算、故此項工程估計、當較河中積水厚量、加倍計算、方足免工程有溢出預算之虞、</p>
<h3>閔行各公團防務會議</h3>
<p>議决擴充保衛團員</p>

<h3>來滬米船在蘇被扣</h3>
<p>北市龔鴻記經售米糧號、昨報告滬北經售米糧公會、以該號因本滬米糧少到、通函内地行各源運滬、藉平米價、而濟民食茲由望亭潘恒升米行、装朱阿聴船白粳二百三十石、又晉升行装命浩三船白粳二百四十石、在楓橋稅卡照數納稅、開票運申、鄧船稅票蘇字七九二六八九號、朱船稅票蘇字七九二六九一號、詎料駛至閭門外四擺渡地方、被蘇州市公安局水巡隊第一分隊盤詰、經呈騐稅票無訛放行、乃行約一里餘、復由該隊派小巡船追回扣留、查上年米船在蘇被扣、係因稅票與石數不符、此次則照數納稅、扣留原因、聞係遏糶、請速援助放行、否則内地米船、將無法來滬云云、該會據函、將於今日討論援助辦法云、</p>

<h3>我們爲什麽要討伐閻逆錫山</h3>
<p>當此统一不久、民困未蘇、凡我全體同志與全國同胞、應如何團結一致、擁護中央、鞏固統一、使編遣得以實施、訓政得以進行、建設得以實現、乃一年以來、禍亂迭興、桂張馮唐諸叛逆先後稱兵、背叛黨國、致和平統一、屢遭破壞、幸賴本黨將士全體同志之忠勇奮發、團結一致、及全國同胞之眞切擁護與帮助、卒能於極短期間、將背叛中央、危害黨國、自絕於黨國、自絕於民衆之逆賊次第撲滅、方慶國内反動勢力從此肅淸、和平統一從此永保、全國同胞從此得以安居樂業、休養生息、不料閻逆錫山、忽於邊防正在吃緊、殘逆尙未肅淸之際、又復擅出主張、要挾中央、招聚軍閥餘孽、共黨土匪、及一切反動分子於太原、濫發通電、倡亂禍國、移動軍隊、拘捕黨員、封閉中央在平津之黨政機關、中央以寬大爲懷、容忍再四、雖彼叛跡已著、猶不遽爾下令討伐、蓋冀其尙能幡然悔悟、免再發生戰禍、以保存國家之元氣也、乃閻逆梟獍之性、終不可改、軍閥野心、終不稍戢、近更變本加厲、倒行逆施、陽言出洋、陰則備戰、縱馮回陜、實行動員、是乃喪心病狂、蓄志謀逆、甘冒破壞和平統一之罪、願作桂馮張唐之續、中央爲維持黨國紀綱、鞏固統一和平起見、實已忍無可忍、恕無可恕、惟有明令討伐、掃除奸兇、在此討逆期間、吾人對於閻逆叛黨禍國之罪惡、及討伐之意義、有不可不深切認識及努力進行者、茲特臚陳於左、以爲國人告　　（一）閻錫山叛黨禍國之罪惡　　一·假革命之名攫取權位、辛亥以前閻錫山在日本留學時、雖曾一度加入同盟會、但回國後即任山西新軍第一標標統、甘爲满淸臣奴、不復以革命事業存於心胸、辛亥九月八日晋軍舉義、新軍二標營長姚以价率領全體官兵攻破省城、復以一連攻满洲城、一連攻巡撫衙門、一連由姚親領、居中策應、苦戰一日、擊斃山西巡撫、同時</p>
<p>满洲城亦攻破、但姚之部下亦損失甚鉅、所存餘者寥寥數十人而已、先是第二標標統黃國樑已奉令開離省城、閻錫山擁有全標軍士、竟按兵不動、即有待機殘害革命軍、邀功淸廷之意、迨聞满城旣破、巡撫擊弊、乃急令所部分頭佔領火藥局軍械庫等處、始宣言彼係同盟會會員、願與姚合作、復乘機派遣私黨、四出運動、邀請各首義官佐於舊諮議局開會、因其擁有動兵、遂得公推爲臨時都會、據有山西之地盤、而做其十餘年來之土皇帝、　　二·殘殺同志勸袁稱帝、閻錫山自假名同盟、攫取山西地盤後、即日以賄賂勾結北洋軍閥爲事、及袁世凱以詐術取得大總統之名器、閻逆對之、百計奉承、慇懃備至、爲求固籠寵計、首先宣告脫離黨籍、日從事於殘殺革命同志、解散革命機關、張士秀·李嗚鳳同志之解平入獄、河東事件、革命同志之大遭屠殺、使本黨總理所領導之北方革命勢力、幾爲消滅、又常倡軍國與帝國相表裏、必先改建帝國方能造成軍國之謬說、以助長袁世凱專制之思想、而促成其帝制自雄之野心、籌安會成立、除自已報效二百萬外、復勸山西某票商捐助三百萬元、更恐袁逆不能澈底信任、又將其父母送往北京作質、列復派員勸進、首先稱臣、而袁世凱遂以宣佈帝制聞矣、革命先烈拚頭顱、洒熱血、所換得之中華民國、因袁氏稱帝而幾於中斷、推原禍首、實皆閻逆錫山陰謀慫恿所釀成、</p>
<p>三·假名村治搜括民財、閻逆貪酷性成、奸謀百出、治晋十餘年、以實行村治相標榜、國人貴耳賤目、以訛傳訛、遂羣奉以模範督軍之譽、其實彼所辦理之村治、純係紙上文章、近據各地社會團體實際調查之報告、知其所謂村治、不過利用一般四五十歲以上吸食鴉片紅丸之鄉村長向地方搜括錢財、簡言之、即以鄉長村長、爲其個人聚斂搜括之工具而已、二年前閻逆曾派其姓姪携其歷年所搜括之一部分、共二千萬元、存放法國銀行、嗣因其姪在法狂嫖闊賭、縱慾殞命、法銀行乃没收其存欵、（理由爲存欵係用姪之名非閻之名義、今乃姪旣死、當收爲法國公有）、閻逆痛急萬分、去秋馮逆叛變、彼之所以揚言伴馮出洋者、蓋即爲欲親向法國交涉此大宗寃孽存欵之故耳、今以此事無收回之望、乃復圖謀不軌、窮事搜括、一年以來、閻逆據有晋冀察綏四省之地、收入更多、視河北爲殖民地、令按月繳現金二百萬元、彼猶以爲未足、在山西濫發紙幣、以</p>
<p>吸收四省之現金、其貪殘狡毒、亘古所無、　　四·摧殘敎育實行愚民、山西之敎育、一言以蔽之曰「愚民政策之敎育」而已、其敎育之宗旨、表面上爲軍國民主義、實際上則欲使山西人民爲閻逆個人之奴隸與順民、與馮玉祥之訓練士兵、使之祗知有馮總司令者如出一轍、閻逆又在太原設立育才館、凡國内外任何學校畢業之學生、均須人館二年、必欲馴服之使受走狗之訓練、方得予以辦事之機會、否則、或驅之出境、或設法使之吸食鴉片紅丸、以戕賊其志氣與能力、甚至對於大中小學之學生、亦日以鴉片紅丸嗎啡誘使靑年吸食、使爲風氣、此其目的、蓋不舊在愚民、實欲滅民、務使山西人民毒染日深、朝氣盡喪、無復有革命思想、無復有革命能力、而彼乃得以永保位置、長做其山西之土皇帝、</p>
<p>五·破壞交通擾亂金融、閻逆錫山自十七年秋投機加入本黨後、種種罪惡、馨竹難書、兩年以來、在平漢平緩兩全路提取恊餉、扣留車輛、幾於無日無之、致兩路財政瀕於破產、據現已報告者、由平漢平緩兩路提去恊餉共約五百五十餘萬元、、又平緩正太兩路、自十七年十二月起、至去年七八月止、共亦不下四十萬元、未報告者尙不在内、至其數年來沿平漢路所扣留之車輛、爲數已達數百輛以上、始終未還路局、致令平漢鐡路之交通、日趨衰落、無可整頓、總之、閻逆盤據北方、强佔平漢平綏兩路、視同私產、目無國家、弁髦法令、更復縱容軍隊、擅賣車皮、晋煤運輸、强制減價、以飽私囊、以致平漢平綏等路營業、一落千丈、按平漢路往昔每年營業進欵、至少在三千萬元以上、而去年全年進欵不過一千萬元左右、平綏路昔時進欵亦在九百萬元以上、而去年尙不足五百元萬元、閻逆最近又扣留津浦北段通車及各次客車、以輸送軍隊、並監視電報、劫持路務、德州以南之路軌及鐡橋、亦被炸毁、其破壞交通之罪惡、較之馮唐、實又過之、民國以來、運閥割據、連年戰爭、其能倖保和平、不受戰禍者僅山西小而已、以常例推測、山西之經濟狀况與民衆生活、必當較優於各省、然事實昭示吾</p>
<p>人、適得其反、現山西省銀行發行不兌現紙幣、數量之多、除山西省財政當局外、恐無一人能知其確數、中央前爲整理山西銀行鈔票起見、曾經核准發行整理山西金融公債二千四百萬元、以資救濟、乃最近閻逆竟又採取現金集中辦法、濫</p>
<p>發大宗紙幣、禁止現銀出口、金融愈形紊亂、人民日益困苦、幸此項債票、現中央已决議取消、未至流行、否則山西人民又不知受偌大損失矣、　　六·煽動馮唐破統一、閻逆優亂成性、一年來馮玉祥唐生智之先後叛變、實皆由彼一人陰謀嗾使之所致、去秋舊歷八月十四、馮在晋祠、閻曾電馮、謂明日係廢歷中秋、約共賞月、次日、閻宴馮於晋祠、席間鼓動馮逆背叛、無所不至、馮先頗消極、經閻再三慫恿、終爲所動、當即商定軍事由馮負責、政治由閻負責、並計劃一切、及馮部宋哲元孫良試等舉兵失敗、中央軍逼至潼關、閻知事無可爲、乃通電表示絕對擁護中央、并聲言討馮、然終不出一兵、其後石友三部在浦</p>
<p>口叛變、閻又異想天開、派趙丕廉遊說唐生智、促其通電反抗中央、唐生智派代表袁某與之商議、决定黨政由閻負責、西北殘部由唐指揮、閻乃電馮、謂唐生智現在已覺悟、但要汝之軍隊歸彼指揮、馮允之、乃認給唐發動費五十萬元、彼此往返磋商、延遲時日、而唐逆反抗中央之電已發出、因與閻所主張者稍有出入、僅得發動費二十五萬元、後閻見中央軍隊四面圍攻、唐逆不能支持、於是又通電擁護中央、轉而聲言討唐、坐收漁人之利、一年以來、使人呌囂隳突於前、而已則發縱指示於後、成則已受其利、敗則人受其禍、其陰險狡詐、眞無出其右者矣、　　七·妄發主張藉端倡亂、閻逆之加入本黨、從事國民革命、其投機取巧以日加甚、其封建思想、迄未稍改、最近陰謀反動、迭發謬論、初則主張</p>
<p>禮讓爲國、下野負責、繼又由下野負責、變爲一二三四集團軍總司令等組織元老樞密院、終則主張合第一二三屆執監委員共同負責、及舉行全體黨員投票、解决黨是、夫禮讓爲國、是將國家看作一二人之私物、可以隨意私相授受、完全是家天下之頭腦、至於在野負責、更屬矛盾、蓋在野與負責、乃絕對不能兩全之事、考其發言之動機、無非欲藉黨國之美名、脅迫擁擭黨治忠於民衆之蔣介石同志下野、放棄革命之責任、乃起用幾十年來賣國殃民之溥儀·段祺瑞·吳佩孚·張宗昌等一齊上臺、先滅本黨、再亡中國、至主一二三四集團軍總司令等組織元老院檵密院以總攬一切、是直主張以軍主集權、代替民主集權、業已暴露其軍閥之本來面目、無異背叛民衆之供狀、合一　二三屆中央執監於一處、不特違背黨章、且欲將中央依法開除黨籍之反動份子如毛澤東·譚平山·李宗仁·白崇禧·馮玉祥·陳公博等齊集中央、使第三國際共產黨改組派與封建軍閥等、重禍黨國、至於黨員總投票、據何黨章、援何成例、荒唐滑稽、尤足令人噴飯、該逆妄發此種悖謬言論、直不知有黨、更不知有國、其用意、無非欲籍此倡亂而已、</p>
<p>八·勾結反動傾危黨國　一月以來、太原道上、車馬相望、改組派代表郭春濤王法勤、桂系代表、潘宜之、齊夑元代表邊守靖、西山會議派代表鄒魯、安福系代表吳光新等、與土匪代表、日本帝國主義者所派代表、皆麕集太原、譸張爲幻·閻逆對此輩代位、皆列屋而居、禮以上賓、日在自省堂開聯席會議、討論背叛中央危害黨國之方法、聚帝國主義軍閥土匪及一切腐惡貪污份子之大成、若令其僥倖得逞、則不獨現在和平統一之局面破壞無餘、回復過去十餘年來分崩離析之狀態、將見禍變侵尋、陷國家民族萬刦不復之地、</p>
<p>九·封閉黨部拘捕黨員　平津各地黨部、自閻逆蒸電發出後、雖在封建勢力之下、仍能本　總理大無畏之精神、努力工作、力駁蒸電之非、並印發各種闡明非統一不能言和平、非和平不能言建設之各種刊物、遍貼各種布畫及標語、以正人民之視聽、閻逆乃密令在平津之軍隊、封閉平津兩特别市及河北省黨部、强令停止工作、並拘捕天津特别市黨部宣傳部長魯蕩平、河北省整理委員賈毅、又派兵佔據中央在平津宣傳機關華北日報及中央能訊分社、逮捕其主任尹述賢、此種破壞黨務、摧殘革命之惡毒殘酷手段、前此馮唐諸逆尙有憚而不敢爲、而閻逆悍然爲之而不顧、其罪惡實浮於馮唐二逆之上、</p>
<p>十·陽唱出洋陰行南犯、閻逆錫山自妄發謬論後、全國民衆羣起攻擊、中央以寬大爲懷、但求和平、不究旣往、一聽其自動辭職、曲予優容、乃閻逆包藏禍心、至死不悟、一面向中央聲言下野出洋、一面仍在太原召集軍事會議、嗾使部下發挽留之電報、一面慫恿馮玉親回潼關、出兵東犯、同時又在河北、帶預徵錢糧、招募新兵、準備南犯、閻逆此舉、自謂先發制人、不知叛黨禍國之罪惡愈顯、則其消滅敗亡亦愈速、此證之於過去車實而歷歷不爽者也、</p>
<p>十一·勾結外人賣國求助、　民國以來、北洋軍閥互相火併、互相斫殺、循環報復、不下十次、閻逆依違其間、雙方勾結、從未有顯明之表示、此雖其生性險滑使然、而庸劣恇怯、亦其一因、民十五反奉之役、國人義爲反常、實則閻逆之敢於發難、純受日本帝國主義之慫恿與暗助、蓋圖逆爲親日之段系嫡裔、段爲奉方所逐、乃運動日本、唆助閻逆反奉、此次叛變、同出一轍、閻逆蓄志背叛中央、欲得日本之助力、日本欲積極侵略華北、遂利用閻逆爲傀儡、又得陸宗與等居間拉攏、遂訂立一種賣國條約、其内容爲日本盡量以財力軍械供給閻逆、反抗中央、在北平設立政府、而閻逆則允以山西最大利源之礦山開採權、及内蒙鐡路之敷設權、以爲酬報、兩月以前、此約經已成立、日本方面、除陸續以各種軍械運送山西外、並由參謀本部秘密派遣人員長駐太原天津北平三處、爲閻逆計劃各路軍事、最近閻逆三路南犯之戰略、即係採用日本參謀之獻議、閻逆知南犯未必得手、乃預爲負責嵎持久之計、又與美法比公司訂借二千萬元之鉅欵、半屬現欵、半以麵粉作價、一部分已由津運晋、閻逆撥付馮逆之二百萬元、及麵粉三十萬袋、即此欵之一部、總之閻逆爲背叛中央、满足野心之故、不惜以華　北民衆爲犠牲、不惜以國家主權爲代價、其賣國求助之罪、較馮逆之勾結蘇俄、斷送蒙古新疆、實有過之無不及、</p>
<p>（二）討伐閻逆錫山吾人應有之認識與努力一·閻逆本一反覆無常寡廉鮮恥之北洋餘孼、前年之𨡁顏來歸、本黨仍曲予優容者、原欲與以向善之機會、以　總理之人格同志之精誠感化之、冀其從此洗心革面、人於正軌、稍樹功勳、以贖前愆也、乃閻逆梟獍之性、終一可改、自其加入本黨以來、貌爲忠厚、陰實叵測、二年以來、爲鬼爲蜮、奸險絕倫、以中央推心置腹之人、而爲搗亂謀叛之舉、假革命之名、以摧殘革命、勾結</p>
<p>帝國主義與腐惡勢力、背叛黨國、破壞和平統</p>
<p>一、甘爲戎首、兇頑惡毒、至死不悟、是已自絕於黨、自絕於國、用是迅頒明令、大張撻伐、以肅整國家之紀綱、以維護人間之正氣、　　二·方今民衆最迫切之要求、在國家之和平與統一、而進行訓政建設、完成國民革命之必要條件、亦爲國家之和平與統一、蓋唯和平統一、然後可以恢復社會之元氣、唯統一、然後可以建立國家、權力、和平統一、乃中央本人民實際需要而定之根本政策、力行此政策者、乃人民之友、違背此政策者、即人民之敵、其理至爲明顯、閻逆最近所發之狂妄言論、與其一年來陰謀險詐之惡毒行動、實無一而非破壞和平與統一、在此以黨治國時代、凡違反本黨之紀律、弁髦國家法令、圖謀破壞和平統一者、是爲造　亂、反之、服從中央之命令、奉行國家之法律、剷除危害黨國之叛徒民賊、維護國家之和平統一者、是爲戢戡亂、中央秉承、總理遣敎、從事革命建設、對此造亂之封建軍閥、不能不大張捷伐、掃除兇頑、鞏固國家之統一、保障革命之勝利、俾訓政得以推行、建設得以實施、以與我全國同胞、共立新中國之宏模、</p>
<p>三·本黨爲全國民衆所信仰擁戴之革命、政黨、以過去事實所昭示、服從中央者存在、背叛中央者覆亡、前此桂系馮唐諸逆、據地不爲不廣、擁兵不爲不多、然一旦背叛中央、即爲全國民衆所睡棄、被革命武力所掃蕩、匝月之間、消滅無餘、閻逆之末路、何能例外、惟閻逆盤據山西、根深蒂固、近又招納腐惡、虚張聲勢、雖其力不足以搖動　中央、危害黨國、然豖突狼奔、負嵑困鬥、足以延長戰禍、加重國人之苦痛、我全國民衆、當認識此次討伐閻逆、乃本黨對北洋餘孼根本之肅淸、乃革命與的革命最後之决戰、此僅存之北洋</p>
<p>軍閻一旦剷除、聯合之腐惡勢力同時摧陷、則反</p>
<p>動之根株永絕、國家之統一確保、建設得以暢遂進行、訓政得以如期實現、我晉冀察綏四省民</p>
<p>衆、久處閻逆暴力之下、備受敵剝摧殘之禍、爲消除苦痛計、爲减輕戰禍計、尤應一致起來、大舉聯合、恊助中央、以撲滅此禍晉叛黨、賣民殃民之逆賊、</p>
<p>（三）標語口號</p>

<h3>怎樣紀念「四一二」？</h3>
<p>肅淸中國共產黨餘孽</p>
<p>打倒北洋軍閥閻錫山</p>
<p>廢除一切不平等條約　　擁護勞苦功高蔣主席</p>
<p>（一）四一二淸黨紀念　就是本黨淸除跨黨的共產黨徒的紀念日、是本黨危而復安之重要關頭、與民生福利國家基礎民族安危··所關甚鉅、吾人應利用此項機會、作淸黨反共大宣傳、以絕滅共產黨之根株、鞏固本黨</p>
<p>之基礎、　　（二）淸黨反共宣傳之目的、可分淸黨反共兩方面加以說明、所謂淸黨宣傳、就是要民衆明瞭本黨淸除跨黨份子的用意經過和關係、使民衆明瞭跨黨份子不淸除、則黨將不黨、國將不國、所謂反共宣傳、就是要民衆明瞭共產黨的罪惡、不獨不可任其寄生於本黨、而應該阻止其活動、肅淸其黨羽、</p>
<p>（三）本黨十三年容納共產黨　是容納共產黨*</p>
<p>員個人冀其效忠於三民主義、不是容納整個共產黨、以分化國民黨、不料掛羊頭賣狗肉的共產黨徒加入國民黨以後、便假國民黨之名、行共產黨之實、曲解三民主義、迷惑靑年、誘迫工人、做他們犠牲的工具、用盡各種方法、企圖盜竊黨權、奪取政權、以達其「中華歸俄」之目的、</p>
<p>（四）在十六年北伐千鈞一髮之際共產黨一方面用利誘威迫的方法、煽動工友、無故罷工、使各地發主騷擾、以搗亂北伐的後方、一方面用挑撥離間之手叚、隔離本黨與各界革命民衆的聯合戰綫、以消失他們對於黨的同情、可謂極盡陰險破壞之能事、而其惟一企圖、無非欲破壞國民革命、以傾覆本黨、滅亡中國而已、幸本黨先進同志摘發其陰謀、毅然决於十六四月十二舉行淸黨、把跨黨份子統統淸除、所以淸黨運動、是我們救黨的首要工作、也就是救國的不二法門、因爲本黨是爲剷除「中國獨立」的障碍物而淸黨、是爲「鞏固本黨」的基礎完成本黨的使命而淸黨、是爲（保障民衆）的利益而淸黨的、</p>
<p>（五）淸黨的工作、固然重要、然淸黨不過是反共方法之一、不是反共的唯一方法、僅僅淸了黨而不繼續反共、則共產的殘餘勢力、還是不易撲滅、難保不死杰復燃、所以淸黨以後、我們必須繼續反共、根本撲滅中國共產黨、</p>
<p>（六）消極的反共工作、固然在所必需、積極方面的建設工作、也非常重要、民衆應擁護本黨訓民以致、恊助政府、從事建設、實施地方自治、完成訓政工作、這可說是積極方面的反共工作、</p>
<p>（七）吾人最後、尤須深刻認識、本黨在過去期間、旣已毅然淸除共產黨、則此後之反動份子、如改組派西山會議派、凡除名黨痞、及無聊政客、與夫封建思想之北洋軍閥、旣不了解中國之環境、復昧昧於世界之大勢、詆毁中央、蓄心破壞、每每受共產黨之利用反不自知、遠之如馮唐張李之擅自稱兵、近之如閻錫山之背叛黨國、均有本黨之所不容、尤在絕對肅淸剷除之列、故在反革命份子、一日未剷除之前、則本黨所領導之國民革命、一日不能成功、本黨同志、應矢勤矢勇、格外努力、使全黨之主義、早日實現、革命早日成功、此實爲吾人今後急應注意和努力之點、</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Truth of the London Naval Conference</h3>
<p>The nations of the world today all deeply fear the disaster of war, and none are willing to initiate war themselves. Therefore, the desire to avoid war is a common sentiment of the world's people. The desire to reduce military armaments is also the sincere intention of each nation. Since the European War, all nations have suffered greatly. This is the first reason for not wanting war. Now, with the exhaustion of the people's strength, the decline of commerce, and the heavy financial burden of military armaments, all nations are lagging behind. Therefore, there is both a desire to avoid war and a sincere desire to reduce armaments. This is the second reason. What makes it difficult to succeed is that everyone wants others to reduce their armaments before them, so that their own country will not be at risk of being invaded. Even if that is not the case, other countries must reduce their armaments at the same time and to the same extent as their own, so that their own country will not suffer any consequences after the reduction. No country is willing to resolutely and decisively, regardless of what other countries do, make large-scale reductions to its own indispensable national defense, in order to set an example for other countries. The distrust has not been eliminated and confidence is consequently insufficient. Although they each try their best, they are all acting reluctantly. Japan's reply, accepting the American proposal but adding reservations, was met with opposition from the people, who feared that it would hinder national defense. France's military reduction must require national guarantees, also for fear of being invaded. Trustworthiness between people, that is, between countries, cannot be achieved, and only military force is sought for self-preservation. Then the desire to reduce armaments is truly not easy. Moreover, countries with strong military armaments, whose finances are not yet in dire straits, will do everything in their power to maintain the status quo. Therefore, the inability to reduce armaments may not be entirely voluntary for the various countries.</p>

<h3>The Situation Between Britain and France at the Naval Conference Relaxes</h3>
<p>The American Plenipotentiary Suspends His Return Home Deliberation on Switching Ship Types Next Week</p>
<p>Dentsu Agency, London, 6th: Although it is reported that there has been no progress in the Anglo-French negotiations on the 5th, it seems that a private proposal has been reached due to the approach of both parties. Mr. Briand plans to consult with Prime Minister Tardieu after returning home, and will go to London again on the 8th to meet with Prime Minister MacDonald. The content does not seem sufficient to satisfy France's desire to reduce the number of tons required, so it is doubtful whether Prime Minister Tardieu can agree. But in any case, the five-nation conference will continue. The British plenipotentiary, who had decided to return home and had already reserved a cabin, canceled the cabin reservation and suspended his return home, seeing that the situation between Britain and France has eased. Dentsu Agency, Tokyo, 6th: There seem to be many people in the Privy Council who do not like the Japan-US compromise案 (proposal?) at the London conference, thinking that a 70% auxiliary ship ratio to the US is the minimum limit for Japan's defense. Before his departure, the plenipotentiary of the Ministry of Finance also stated clearly that the recognition of retaining 60% of battleships at the Pacific Conference was promised on the premise of restricting Atlantic defenses and unlimited construction of auxiliary ships. If, as is generally reported, the government strongly suppressed the opinions of the Naval General Staff and drafted a reply案, then the Hamaguchi cabinet will inevitably be criticized for being rash and incautious. As a formal report has not yet been obtained, no judgment can be made. The retention of Japan's holdings after 1936 must have the same force as a treaty. If the retention form fails to meet our expectations, then there is no way to consult, and it is difficult to approve, it is said.</p>
<p>Dentsu Agency, London, 5th: Prime Minister MacDonald and Plenipotentiary Henderson met with Plenipotentiary Briand at St. James's Palace this morning at 11:00 to make</p>
<p>a final effort on the Anglo-French negotiations, but there has been no progress. Briand will start his return to Paris at 2:00 pm. The meeting will be held again next Tuesday. Dentsu Agency, London, 5th: Regarding the request for the conversion of the 20,000-ton ship type from destroyers to submarines, which is an important item for the Anglo-Japanese and US tripartite agreement, the tripartite plenipotentiary conference is scheduled to deliberate next week. The British side is hoping that the three countries will consider the issue of ship type conversion, even if the five-nation conference fails. However, due to the British and American advocacy of the complete abolition of submarines, it is feared that it will be quite difficult to obtain the approval of both parties for the conversion from destroyers to submarines. Reuters, London, 5th: The Anglo-French representatives at the naval conference have been conducting political negotiations for several days. The coming week will be the most important period for the success or failure of the naval conference. The Anglo-French representatives want to obtain a formula to agree on the interpretation of a certain article of the League of Nations charter, so that it can both increase France's sense of security and allow it to reduce its naval tonnage, and not expand Britain's burden. The British Prime Minister and British and French foreign affairs authorities and experts have been meeting frequently for a long time. They continued their talks at St. James's Palace today. It is heard that the talks are progressing, but French Foreign Minister Briand will return to Paris tonight to report on the progress to the French government, so the meeting will have to be suspended for several days. Briand will be able to return to London on Tuesday to continue the meeting. The British representatives have not abandoned hope of overcoming the last difficulties,</p>
<h3>Indian Railway Workers Strike</h3>
<p>Decided to Obstruct Train Operations</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 5th: Last night's shooting of striking railway workers by police has prompted the realization of non-violent resistance on the railway. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway workers held a meeting this morning and decided to obstruct train operations. The method is to form several teams of strikers to lie on the tracks. The current slogan of the strikers is "Use my bricks to fight their batons." It is agreed that if the police drive them away, the strikers will respond with Indian bullets (referring to bricks and stones). If the police detain a small number of people, the majority will follow. It is estimated that 7,000 people have volunteered to take on the work of non-violent resistance.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Breaks Salt Law</h3>
<p>Volunteers' Teams Enter Beach to Collect Salt</p>
<p>Chief Assistant Kothari Arrested</p>
<p>Reuters, Geraldpur, 6th – Gandhi has broken the salt law.</p>
<p>Reuters, Dandi, 6th – After prayers, Gandhi this morning at 6 o'clock led eighty-four followers directly to the small beach, accompanied by a large crowd. Gandhi advanced slowly, his manner extremely solemn. The volunteers, amidst shouts of "Victory to Gandhi," stepped into the sea and then picked up the salt accumulated on the beach. The salt law is now broken.</p>
<p>Reuters, Dandi, 6th – No police were present when Gandhi and his followers broke the salt law. As the volunteers picked up salt, Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, who was walking with Gandhi, joyfully called out to Gandhi, "Lawbreaker!" Gandhi published a declaration in the newspapers, earnestly advising laborers everywhere to make their own salt and that the war to resist the salt tax should continue for a week, until April 13th. All those engaged in this sacred work should devote their full efforts to promoting the boycott of foreign cloth and strictly abstain from alcohol. He also said that Indian women are now awakened and that he intends to announce to them that women can make an even greater contribution than men to the realization of Indian independence.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 6th – Gandhi announced to all the children of India that if the elders are arrested and imprisoned, then the young should take their place in spinning yarn. This morning, officials from the All India Congress Committee drew seawater at the Juhu beach, ten miles from Bombay, to break the salt law. No police were present at the time, and no incidents occurred.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 6th – Kothari, one of Gandhi's chief assistants, was arrested today in Viragaon.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geraldpur, 5th – Four hundred armed police have arrived in Dandi, and another hundred are also heading to Dandi in preparation for tomorrow's events. Gandhi stated that if he is arrested, then former judge of the Baroda High Court, Talyarkhan, is willing to take his place. Volunteers are prepared to begin selling people's salt tomorrow in Ahmedabad.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Plans to Increase Compulsory Education Funding</h3>
<p>Nippon Dempo, Tokyo, 6th – The Ministry of Education, in view of the recent excuses by various localities of insufficient funds causing various difficulties for elementary school teachers, recently issued multiple inquiries to inquire whether this is the case. At the same time, it issued a notification to local officials, ordering them to consider the issue of salary reductions for teachers with extra care. Hokkaido, Aichi, Ibaraki, Saitama, and other localities have all been investigated and found to be due to the financial difficulties of the local governments. The government, therefore, plans to increase compulsory education funding to remedy the situation, which will become a major issue in the extraordinary session of the Diet. Officials at the Ministry of Education are quite concerned about this.</p>
<h3>Seiyukai Prepares for Diet Battle</h3>
<p>Nippon Dempo, Tokyo, 6th – The Seiyukai is currently diligently studying countermeasures for the extraordinary session of the Diet. This time, not only is it an opposition party and a minority party, but also several major issues need to be discussed, such as the disarmament conference, national defense issues, the post-gold standard lifting arrangements, tax reduction issues, compulsory education funding increase issues, election interference, the responsibility of Interior Minister Adachi, and the disciplinary rectification issue. Therefore, a cautious attitude is being taken regarding the selection of officers. The majority of party members unanimously advocate emphasizing talent and want to recruit combative individuals, so the local organizations are not necessarily the criteria. Generally, one or two people will be selected from former cabinet ministers and four or five people will be selected from the former parliamentary secretary level to strengthen the lineup and directly challenge the government.</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Disputes in Japan Increasingly on the Rise</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 6th – According to a survey by the Ministry of Home Affairs, there were 575 labor disputes in Showa 4 (1929), involving 77,000 people, which is 80 more cases and 14,000 more people than the highest record in Taisho 8 (1919), and 180 more cases and 30,000 more people than in Showa 3 (1928). The increase in labor disputes is due to the gradual increase in the organizational power of labor groups and the decline of various industries before and after the lifting of the gold standard.</p>
<h3>Hamaguchi Inquires About Saionji's Illness</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 6th – Prime Minister Hamaguchi went to Okitsu at 2 p.m. yesterday to inquire about the illness of Elder Saionji. Due to the doctor's advice, he did not meet him in person. He only spoke to the medical doctors in charge of treatment, saying that Saionji is an important person for the country and hoped that they would do their best to take care of him. He then returned to his villa in Kamakura from Okitsu at 5 p.m.</p>
<h3>Nakaoka Konichi to Be Released Soon</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 6th – Nakaoka Konichi, who will be released soon, met with his mother, Nobuko, at the Miyagi Prefecture prison at 3 p.m. yesterday. The mother and son had not seen each other for six years. Both were choked with emotion when they met. After the meeting, his mother told people that Konichi looked very well. She advised him not to become a monk, saying that even if he does not become a monk, he must study Buddhism after his release. For convenience, he may have to dress as a monk. She has already lived for nine years and only closed the noodle shop last month, without telling him.</p>
<h3>Major Oil Well in America Continues to Gush Uncontrollably</h3>
<p>Kokumin, Oklahoma City, 5th – After being sealed off last night, the oil well here has once again burst through the sealing material today and continues to gush uncontrollably. The oil company is currently using various methods to rush to plug it and is paying close attention to preventing fires.</p>
<h3>Unemployment Increases in the United States</h3>
<p>Kokumin, New York, 5th – According to news received today from the branches of the Federal Reserve Bank, unemployment in the United States has increased this week compared to before, and the situation is serious. The opposition party is seeking to use this to attack the government. However, detailed unemployment statistics from Britain and other European countries are not yet known. General industry and commerce, however, still show progress.</p>
<h3>Japanese Spinning Mills Implement Salary Cuts</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 6th – The spinning industry, which dominates the Japanese financial world, has recently been in dire straits due to the passage of the Indian Cotton Industry Protection Act in foreign countries and the drastic reduction in demand and increase in inventories domestically. Kanebo has always given a 70% salary increase to its 35,000 workers and a 60% increase to its office staff. It has now decided to abolish this from the 10th and change it to a uniform 30% increase. This was officially announced yesterday. At this time of loudly advocating industrial rationalization, it is the first move by the new president, Nagao, after taking office. Other spinning mills have also been greatly impacted.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 6th – Kanegafuchi Spinning, one of Japan's largest cotton spinning companies, has suddenly announced its intention to cut the wages of 35,000 workers by 30 percent from April 10th. This news is very surprising. According to the company, the ostensible reason for this move is that the company used to give special wartime wages, and now there is no need for special wages, so it has decided to abolish them. However, the real reason is that the Indian tax increase and the commercial slump have greatly impacted the cotton industry. Japanese newspapers say that the authorities are cautiously viewing this matter because it is related to the general social and economic situation.</p>
<h3>Strict Inspection of Japanese Raw Silk</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 6th – Since the Raw Silk Compensation Law was implemented on March 27th, there have been 400 requests for compensation as of today. Recently, because there have been people using substandard raw silk to try to deceive, strict inspections have been carried out since yesterday. Yesterday, there were only fourteen cases.</p>
<h3>French Senate Passes the Young Plan</h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 5th – The French Senate approved the Young Plan by a vote of 284 to 8. French Prime Minister Tardieu, who had been ill for two days, has recovered and was able to attend the Senate today to defend the plan.</p>
<h3>Bomb Case in Jerusalem</h3>
<p>Reuters, Jerusalem, 5th – Five bombs were found today in the Gethsemane Garden here.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Decision on the Route of the New Hai River Diversion Channel</h3>
<p>Hebei Provincial Government Has Resolved to Adopt Line B</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Regarding the route of the new Hai River diversion channel, the Hebei Construction Department previously received an order from the Provincial Government to dispatch Feng Heming, Director of the Yongding River Water Conservancy Bureau, and Liang Ruzhang, Director of the North Canal Water Conservancy Bureau, to investigate. According to the results of the investigation, it is more appropriate to adopt Line B. The Provincial Government Committee specifically submitted a report at its regular meeting yesterday (the 1st). At the same time, Sun Huanlun, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, stated that this matter is important because it relates to local water conservancy and the people's property. It should not be neglected in the slightest. He specifically presented his opinions on the advantages and disadvantages of each line for discussion at the meeting. It was then resolved to adopt Line B and reply to the Hai River Improvement Committee. The following is a record of Sun Huanlun's proposal to show one aspect of the Provincial Government's decision to adopt Line B: "Regarding the previous communications from the Hai River Improvement Committee in the 165th and 166th meetings of this government committee, stating the situation of the route to be adopted for the new diversion channel, please inform Tianjin County to handle it jointly and dispatch personnel to negotiate and decide on the route of the new diversion channel. It was resolved separately to reply that Line D is too close to villages, has too many graves, and the land price is too high, which is inconvenient. It is proposed to adopt a line starting from Line C and ending at Line B, which is more suitable. Personnel have been dispatched to investigate and request that the results of the investigation be submitted to the Construction Department as soon as possible. The Hai River Improvement Committee has proposed four types of digging diversion channels: A, B, C, and D. The Engineering Committee of the committee believes that Lines A and C cannot be used in terms of direction, and Line D is more suitable in terms of engineering than Line B. Therefore, there is a proposal to adopt Line D. This matter relates to local water conservancy and the people's property, so an overall plan should be made to avoid excessive damage. The advantages and disadvantages of Lines B and D and the line proposed by this government are listed below: The advantage of Line B is that in terms of engineering, it can save the embankment raising and thickening project of the North Canal between Qujiadian and Beicang. In terms of the people, because there are fewer graves and most of the land is barren, water can be diverted for irrigation. Villages within the river embankment from Qujiadian to Beicang will not be submerged. In terms of economics, the land price is low. The disadvantage of Line B is that in terms of engineering, the Yongding River channel in Qujiadian must be re-dug. In terms of economics, the route is longer and more soil is required. The advantage of Line D is that in terms of engineering, there is no need to re-dug the Yongding River channel. In terms of economics, the route is shorter and less soil is required. The disadvantage of Line D is that in terms of engineering, the river embankment between Qujiadian and Beicang must be raised and thickened. In terms of the people, there are too many graves, and both sides of the route are fertile fields. Villages within the river embankment from Qujiadian to Beicang are at risk of being submerged in the event of floods. In terms of economics, the land price is too high. The advantage of the line proposed by the Provincial Government is that in terms of engineering, there is no need to re-dug the Yongding River channel. In terms of the people, there are fewer graves than Line D. In terms of economics, less soil is required than Line B. The disadvantage of the line proposed by the Provincial Government is that in terms of engineering, the North Canal embankment between Qujiadian and the starting point of Line C still needs to be raised and thickened. In terms of the people, villages within the embankment from Qujiadian to the starting point of Line C are still at risk of being submerged. In terms of economics, the route is longer than Line D. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of each line, in terms of economics, Line B is longer, the land price is low, and there are fewer graves. Line D is shorter, the land price is high, and there are more graves. The advantages and disadvantages seem to be equal. The most different aspects are engineering and the people. According to the executive committee member of the Hai River Engineering Committee, if Line B is used, the Yongding River channel must be dug, and it is uncertain whether the change in the direction of the river will not cause accidents. Therefore, Line D is preferred. This is based solely on the engineering aspect and does not take into account the people's aspect. However, according to the investigation by the Yongding River and North Canal Water Conservancy Bureau, Line D requires raising and thickening the North Canal embankment between Qujiadian and Beicang, and villages within the embankment are at risk of being submerged during high water. There are also too many graves in that line, and the land is fertile. According to the investigation by the General Affairs Office of the Hai River Committee, the people are willing to adopt either Line A or Line B. Comparing the advantages and disadvantages in terms of engineering and the people, it is still more appropriate to use Line B. The disadvantages of Line D outweigh the advantages and are obvious. As for the line proposed by the Provincial Government, it is between Lines B and D. Although there is nothing inappropriate in terms of engineering, it can only eliminate a part of the harm to the people and cannot be completely without regrets. The key seems to lie entirely in whether the Yongding River excavation project at Qujiadian can be implemented. If there are no obstacles, then Line B can be used as much as possible. If it is indeed inappropriate, then it is appropriate to use the line proposed by the Provincial Government. Are the above points appropriate? The opinions are respectfully submitted for public decision."</p>

<h3>German Industry Inspection Group Arrives in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: When Sun Ke, Minister of Railways, previously visited Germany, he contacted the German industry group and welcomed German industrialists to invest in China and develop various Chinese industries to seek cooperation between the economic circles of China and Germany. At that time, the German Industrial Association agreed to organize an inspection group to come to China to conduct an initial investigation of the economic and industrial situation in southern and northern China. Then, they would return to Germany to formulate a development plan, negotiate with each other, and then invest. In February of this year, the German Industry Inspection Group was established and set out for China on the Japanese mail ship Hakone Maru from the Port of Marseille on February 28. The Ministry of Railways sent Counselor Jin Jingui to welcome them. The ship arrived in Hong Kong at 9 a.m. on March 30. The members of the group stayed overnight at the Kowloon Island Hotel. On the morning of the 31st, they took a ship from Hong Kong to Guangzhou and arrived in the province at 1:30 p.m. The German consul and all the German expatriates in Guangzhou went to the port to welcome them. The provincial government sent representative Jiang, the municipal government sent representative Liang, and representatives from the provincial and municipal party departments and various chambers of commerce were also present to greet them. The German industry group consisted of a total of twelve people, including eight members and the rest being interpreters and attendants. The members of the group and their brief resumes are investigated as follows: (1) Head of the group, Heunich Ketgnann, 57 years old, has served as the manager, director, and representative of the board of directors of the Firma Heine A.G. Leipzig factory. He is currently the leader of the German Industrial Association, Chairman of the Saxon Industrial Association, and a member of the German Industrial Association. (2) German industrial representative, engineer and Doctor of Philosophy H.C. Carl Wendt, 55 years old, has served as the factory manager, office director, and chairman of the German Engineering Society of the Krupp factory. (3) German electrical industry representative, Professor of Industrial University Prot. Dettmar Hannover, has worked on the design of the Soviet government's electricity industry construction and has written extensively. (4) Civil engineering industry representative Rademacher, 51 years old, is currently a senior architect of the German Railway Bureau. The Die Anatolische Eisenbahn of the German Asia Minor Railway was operated by him. He also participated in the construction of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway in China and is quite familiar with the Chinese situation. He is also good at banking and has worked in the Deutsche Bank. (5) German machine industry representative Direktor Von Gontard, 59 years old, has served as a construction engineer and worked for many years at the Firma Hensohel S. Sohn A.G. in Kassel factory and served as a director. (6) Financial advisor to the industry inspection group Dr. Jer Gacody has served as a lawyer for the Great Wall and National Bank International-Bank and has worked in major banks in Paris and London. He has considerable experience in Chinese economy. (7) Representative of the Central Bank, Dr. Schipprl, has served as a counselor of the German Ministry of Finance and a bank director. His main purpose in coming to China is to investigate China's financial and economic situation and China's currency reform. (8) M. Th. Strewe, Secretary of the Industry Inspection Group. After the group arrived, they were invited by the provincial and municipal governments to rest briefly at the New Asia Hotel in Xihai Kou, and then had lunch. At 3:30 p.m., Chen personally received them in the foreign flower hall, and the guests and hosts had a pleasant conversation. After the tea party, photos were taken, and they left at 4:00 p.m. At 4:20 p.m., they went to the municipal government. Mayor Lin Yungai happened to be heading north and had not returned, so the municipal government secretary received them on his behalf and held a tea party to welcome them. They left after 6:00 p.m. In the evening, the provincial government held a banquet in the foreign flower hall to welcome them. The banquet started at 7:00 p.m., and the heads of various agencies accompanied them, totaling more than 80 people, divided into eight tables. During the banquet, Chen Mingshu delivered a welcoming speech, and the head of the inspection group replied. Toasts were exchanged, and the banquet dispersed around 10:00 p.m. Tonight (April 1), the municipal government will hold a formal welcome meeting to entertain the members of the group. During the day, they will visit the Huanghuagang Mausoleum of the 72 Martyrs, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, and Guanyin Mountain Park. On the 2nd, they will visit Luogang Cave. On the 3rd, they will inspect the province's construction projects and then discuss cooperation methods with the Construction Department. After the matter is completed, they will leave Guangzhou on the 4th, take the German ship Derfllirgesr from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and then go to Beijing, Hankou, Beiping, and the three northeastern provinces. After completing inspections in various places, a specific plan will be published. (April 1)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou National Goods Movement Parade</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: On the first of this month, all circles in Guangzhou held a grand meeting to promote the National Goods Movement. The meeting place was located at the East Drill Ground. A huge archway was built outside the field, with the words "National Goods Promotion Meeting" written on it. In the center was the meeting stage, with four loudspeakers installed in front of the stage. The front of the stage was the command stage, the front of the stage was the gathering place for students from various schools, the north was the gathering place for party and government agencies and various groups, the south was the gathering place for national goods parade costume teams and various labor unions, and the west was the gathering place for naval, land, military police. Around the field, there were boy scouts and military police maintaining order. After 10 a.m., members of various groups and staff of various agencies arrived one after another. The meeting started at 12 noon. The party committees of the province and municipality, the provincial and municipal governments, the Department of Construction, the General Chamber of Commerce, the Provincial Business Federation, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Overseas Comrades Society, the Machinery Industry Association, the General Labor Union, the Labor Union Federation, the Women's Federation, the Women's Rights Movement Association, the Provincial Women's Association, the Seamen's Union, and the Police Alumni Association were the presidium, with a total of eighteen groups. Liu Fenqiao, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, was publicly elected as the chairman of the presidium. After the ceremony, Luo Weijiang, executive member of the Provincial Party Committee, announced the reasons for the meeting, saying that unemployment is increasing day by day, social unrest is due to the increase in unemployment, and politics is not stable. However, upon closer examination of why the people's livelihood is in such a predicament, on the one hand, it is due to the constraints of unequal treaties and economic oppression, and at the same time, it is also due to our people's unwillingness to use national goods. In recent years, China has become a sales market for imperialist goods. Since our country's economic power is controlled by foreigners, is it not empty talk to talk about overthrowing imperialism? In the future, we must implement the overthrow of imperialist aggression and save the nation from danger, and we must promote national goods to remedy the leaks. If national goods are revitalized, productivity will naturally increase, foreign goods will naturally decrease imports, and money will not flow out, and the people's livelihood can be maintained. If the people's livelihood is stable, then the society and politics will naturally become more peaceful, and disasters can also be reduced. Next, representatives of the Provincial Government Deng Hua, representatives of the Municipal Party Committee Pu Liangzhu, representatives of the Eighth Route Army Feng Luanhuang, and representatives of the General Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, and the Women's Rights Association delivered speeches in turn. The meaning of promoting national goods was fully expressed. After the speeches, the following proposals were put forward by the presidium of the conference: (1) The government should establish a national goods bank, a national goods exhibition, a national goods sales market, and a daily necessities factory. (2) Please the Central Party Department and the National Government to strictly order all agencies, groups, and schools to use national goods, and those who violate the order will be severely punished. (3) Please the provincial and municipal party committees to be responsible for convening all circles to organize the Guangdong National Goods Promotion Association. (4) Please the Central Government to implement incentives for the production of national goods. (5) Please the government to guarantee the patent rights of various national goods inventions. (6) Notify all silk weaving companies across the country not to use foreign artificial silk raw materials to weave and pretend to be domestic silk. The above proposals were immediately voted on by the whole field, and then high-definition photos were taken, slogans were shouted, and music was played and the meeting was dismissed. It was already 1 p.m. The various circles immediately formed a team to parade, led by Wang Renrong, deputy chief of the headquarters adjutant's office, riding a horse as a guide, followed by the Party and National Flag, the General Assembly Parade Flag, the headquarters military band, and the municipal party boy scouts. The parade team was divided into four major teams, and each major team was divided into several sub-teams, totaling about 100,000 people. There were various styles of parade items, everything that should be there, totaling from the East Drill Ground, passing through Hui Ai East Road, Yong Han South Road, Tianzi Wharf, the Bund, Xihai Kou, Liu Ersan Road, Cailan Street, Fude Road, Shibaba, Shiqifu, Yang Lane, Shangjiupu, Xiguayuan, Fengning Road, Ximenkou, Hui Ai West Road, to sign and disperse in front of Central Park. It was already 3:30 p.m. Looking at the national goods costume team that paraded that day, there were no less than 50 teams. Among them, a large homemade coconut broom with the words "Sweep Away Imported Goods" written on it was particularly meaningful. (March 1 evening)</p>
<h3>The Great Genghis Khan Festival</h3>
<p>Inner and Outer Mongolian Princes Participate Together</p>
<p>The Form of the Mausoleum and Its Arrangement</p>
<p>Suiyuan Correspondence: When we browse through the Yuan Dynasty chronicles, the one who opened up the glory of Eastern land warfare history and established the mighty power of the Yellow race should be Genghis Khan. It has been more than 800 years since then. European war historians still praise him endlessly, calling him the hero of the Yellow race. Although the hero is gone, the mausoleum still exists. The tomb of Genghis Khan is located in the Jungar Banner of the Yikezhao League in Inner Mongolia. A grand festival is held every year on the 15th and 16th of April. The princes of various leagues and banners in Inner and Outer Mongolia gather at that time. It is extremely grand. Now that the festival is approaching, the princes of various leagues and banners have sent envoys to the Suiyuan and Baotou areas to prepare sacrificial offerings. The mausoleum is surrounded by 250 miles, with 500 households living there, called the Outer Guard, specializing in guarding the mausoleum. Each year, in addition to the products within the 250 miles being received by them, the remaining shortfall is subsidized by the leagues and banners, which has evolved into a hereditary system for hundreds of years. Except for the 500 households, no other leagues or banners can live there. Those close to the mausoleum are the Inner Guard, specializing in guarding the mausoleum all night, burning incense and dusting. The monthly income is slightly higher than that of the Outer Guard. Both the Inner and Outer Guards belong to the "Jinu" (Mongolian for mausoleum official). The position of "Jinu" is quite solemn and is concurrently held by the leader of the Yikezhao League. The form and arrangement of the mausoleum are very different from those of the Ming and Qing mausoleums. It was not a burial in the ground. It is a small silver box, three feet five inches long, and one foot five inches wide and high, placed on a mica stone table, with a large offering table in front, on which sacrificial offerings are placed. The incense burner is one foot five inches high, the candlestick is two feet five inches high, and there are many other sacrificial offerings, all made of silver, stored separately and only taken out during the festival. This three-foot silver box is quite luxuriously made, impervious to wind and rain, and difficult to erode by water and soil. It is a pity that it is placed inside a felt tent, which is not very elegant (what is called Mongolian style in the local language). This felt tent is replaced every twelve years, costing more than 2,500 yuan. It is different from ordinary felt tents and is larger and extremely strong. The interior can accommodate 150 people, and incense smoke lingers all day, creating a solemn atmosphere. Whether on foot or on horseback, when passing by the mausoleum, they all pay respects. When the festival arrives, it is extremely lively, with iron cavalry in groups, camel teams traveling thousands of miles, the sound of reed pipes echoing throughout the land, and the voices of people clamoring. Red men and green women, white-haired old men and yellow-haired children, ride on fine horses and rush to the scene. The reporter intends to visit Jungar Banner on this day to pay homage to the outstanding figures of the East, and I will surely gain something in terms of news materials. (March 24)</p>
<h3>Relief for Shipping and Transportation at the Zhenjiang Estuary</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau is Considering Two Measures. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Railways because the Zhenjiang Estuary Station's connection with ships is hampered by silting and rising tides in the river channel during autumn and winter, causing significant losses to commerce and transportation. They requested the Bureau to extend the Zhenjiang Estuary Station to the customs house to facilitate transportation. On the 26th of last month, Liu Weichi, the Director of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau, led engineers to Zhenjiang and, together with committee members Lu and Hu from the Chamber of Commerce, surveyed the terrain. The Bureau believes that extending the Zhenjiang Estuary Station to the Zhenjiang Customs House is not a fundamental solution, as even if the station is extended to the Customs House, the river channel in front of the Customs House, although dredged, may soon lose its effectiveness. Therefore, the Bureau does not agree with this proposal. According to the Bureau's opinion, two measures are proposed: the first is to extend the railway line from Gaozi to the Zhenjiang Estuary to facilitate river transportation; the second is to extend the South Gate Station to the vicinity of the Dongfang Paper Mill at Beigushan. The cost of this project is estimated to be 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Committee members Lu and Hu from the Chamber of Commerce are deeply concerned that the Bureau will adopt the first plan because Gaozi is too far from the old city, and Zhenjiang will find it difficult to benefit in the future. Therefore, they strongly advocate adopting the second plan. As for the required funding of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, the Bureau suggests that the local government should raise the funds first, lend them to the Bureau, and be guaranteed by the Bureau's Silver Company, with the Bureau repaying the funds in installments over the years.</p>

<p>The Provincial Government previously received a proposal from the Department of Construction regarding whether Dahua Shipping Company should be granted an exclusive five-year operating permit on the Hangzhou-Changshan and Hangzhou-Weiping routes to guarantee their investment in hydrofoil boats. The Provincial Committee has now resolved to grant an exclusive operating permit for a term of ten years to encourage investment. The price of rice in Hangzhou has soared, with top-quality rice reaching 16.2 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure) and ordinary rice 13.6 yuan per shi. Ten days ago, there were rumors that desperate citizens were plotting to cause trouble for rice shops in Lake Side, intending to plunder them. Fortunately, Police Chief Li, acting on reports, took strict precautions, and the threat has dissipated invisibly for a week. However, the people's livelihood is becoming increasingly difficult, and it is hoped that the authorities will find a way to stabilize rice prices to maintain order. The Hangzhou General Chamber of Commerce, the Money Trade Association, and various banks were ordered to nominate members to the Public Bond Fund Management Committee. They separately nominated Xie Hucheng, Wang Ziqiu, and Xu Shucen as members. Now, they have been ordered to add one more member each to show transparency, as the rules for managing the funds have been revised. It is said that the Chamber of Commerce plans to nominate Yao Yinsheng, the Money Trade Association Li Chunzhi, and the banking industry Wang Xiangquan. The new tea from Mingqian in Xihu Beishan, Longjing, and other places has already been on the market, with prices ranging from 8 yuan per jin (unit of weight) to 10 or 12 yuan for finer varieties. Unfortunately, production is limited, totaling less than 100 jin. Tea merchants from various regions have already arrived in Hangzhou to purchase the tea.</p>

Zou A’yun, a villager from the Mawangjing Township of Qingpu, engaged A’shi, the second daughter of Zhou Jinru from Zhoujia Village, as his wife through a matchmaker in the 15th year of the Republic. Last month, he notified the Zhou family that he had chosen an auspicious date ("the third day") for the wedding. Zhou also expressed his agreement. Zou made preparations for the wedding in advance and was extremely busy. The day before the wedding, relatives and friends gathered, a lavish banquet was prepared, and a bridal sedan was hired to go to the bride's house for the wedding. However, there was no movement at the Zhou's house. The sedan porters carried the bridal sedan back to the groom and inquired about the situation. He immediately went to the bride's house with the matchmaker to demand an explanation. Zou's father-in-law said that his daughter had disappeared the day before and asked for a postponement of the wedding. Zou believed that since the announcement had been made in advance and the change occurred so suddenly, there must be another reason, and he planned to file a lawsuit immediately. The matter is currently under mediation by relatives and friends, and it is not known how it will be resolved.</p>

<h3>China Gradually Adopts the Gold Standard</h3>
<p>Summary of the Draft Currency Law (3) (Continued)　　Abolition of Old Currency</p>
<p>The task of replacing the existing currency with the gold standard currency is entrusted to the National Currency System Commission, whose chairman is concurrently the Director of the Currency System Department. Provincial Currency System Commissions are also established as necessary to assist. The task of the Provincial Currency System Commissions particularly focuses on informing the public of the benefits of the new currency system, the penalties and restrictions on old currency, and the locations and official rates for exchanging old currency for new currency. 　　Abolition of Old Paper Currency　　The draft proposal by the Design Committee for reorganizing the Central Bank into the Central Reserve Bank stipulates that the issuance of paper currency should be exclusively handled by the new Central Reserve Bank in the plan. Therefore, this draft proposal seeks to recall the various paper currencies currently in circulation. When this draft becomes law, paper currencies issued by various provinces, localities, banks (except the Central Bank), shops, or private individuals should cease issuance and be withdrawn swiftly. The final recall date for paper currency in each province should not be earlier than the debt conversion date and should be announced at least one year in advance. Before this date, all paper currencies should be recalled at par value. However, if the paper currency depreciates excessively and remains so for a period, it is stipulated that it can be redeemed at a price lower than the face value under certain conditions, as determined by the Minister of Finance. 　　If a province, locality, provincial bank, or local bank cannot recall all its paper currency before the specified date, it must deposit sufficient gold standard currency in a designated agency and recall the circulating difference at par value. If sufficient currency is not available for this purpose, interest-bearing bonds can be used to withdraw the uncollected paper currency. 　　If a bank or other private organization has paper currency in circulation that cannot be fully recalled before the final recall date, a tax will be levied on the uncollected paper currency, at a rate of half a mill per month in the first year, one mill per month in the second year, and one and a half mills per month thereafter. Banks owing substantial amounts to the National Government are entitled to a reduction of three-quarters of the tax on the portion of their uncollected paper currency equal to their holdings of National Government bonds. After the bonds have been repaid by the government or sold by the bank, the tax-exempt portion of the paper currency must be reduced accordingly. Before the final recall date for paper currency, the government must settle its unfunded liabilities to banks with cash or various types of bonds.</p>
<h3>Shortcomings of the Silver Standard Proposal</h3>
<p>The Design Committee has studied the proposed plan to unify the national currency on a silver basis and then switch to a gold basis. According to the Committee's opinion, this proposal has significant errors for the following reasons: After the difficult task of unifying the currency system is completed, the desire to proceed with a gold basis and stipulate the necessary difference between the actual value and face value of silver coins will inevitably lead to an increase in the face value of silver coins. However, in the gold standard, the actual value of silver coins usually needs to be equal to two-thirds of the face value of silver coins. This method of relatively reducing domestic currency is indeed a painful move, which can make industry and export trade slump, harm the laboring class, and is extremely unfair to a certain class. If, in the future, credit gold standard currency is recast to replace the increased value of silver coins, the state must recall its newly issued silver standard currency and suffer a double loss, and it is also inconvenient for the people, which is unnecessary. 　　Moreover, proceeding with a gold-based plan using this indirect method means that the country continues to hold a second currency system reform. After the currency system is unified on a silver basis, a second reform based on gold must be carried out soon. This reform, in any case, is full of thorns, and if there is significant opposition during the second reform after the first reform has been completed, the move to adopt a gold basis will not be easily realized. 　　The indirect method also has a significant shortcoming, namely the loss of the huge seigniorage profit owned by the government. After the value of silver standard currency is increased to make it suitable for the gold standard, these currencies become credit currency, but the seigniorage profit that can belong to the government is dissipated into the hands of private individuals and no longer belongs to the government. These benefits are mostly obtained by speculators, who are most active during this period. The experience of the Straits Settlements in 1905 and 1906 due to the adoption of this currency system reform can provide us with a valuable lesson. 　　The indirect plan sooner or later requires huge loans to establish the necessary gold reserve. Conversely, the direct plan is truly self-sufficient except for the small amount of loans required at the beginning, and the loans can also be repaid with the profits obtained from the reform itself. The indirect plan also wastes time, making it impossible for China to enjoy the benefits of the gold standard enjoyed by almost all other important countries today after many years. 　　A unified gold standard currency is a major help to China's industry and commerce, which can increase production, develop foreign trade, and enhance the happiness of the people nationwide. The direct adoption of the gold standard method is also the most economical, has the least hindrance to domestic industry, and its greatest benefit is that it allows China to immediately adopt the gold standard in more advanced regions.</p>

<h3>The Psychology of the Crowd in the Venue</h3>
<p>—Most Believe Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Shanghai Are the Most Promising—</p>
<p>Strive for the Future of Winning Athletes　　Attend the Far Eastern Games to Bring Glory to the Country　　The Games have been open for six days so far. The results of the track and field and ball game competitions in these six days show that most of the championships were won by teams from Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Shanghai. Because the authorities stipulated that the championship athletes of the National Games would participate in the Far Eastern Games, the crowd at the venue today expressed very sincere expectations for the championship athletes from Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Shanghai. The conversations of the people I interviewed are recorded briefly below. 　　Dai Jitao　According to what Dai told the reporter, looking at the results of the continuous sports, the athletes of Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Shanghai are the best, and the female athletes of Heilongjiang, Liu Jingzhen, Sun Guiyun, and Wu Meixian, especially, can promote Chinese women's sports with their outstanding performance. It is especially admirable. If the athletes can work harder in the Far Eastern Games, China's international status will naturally increase. 　　Zhang Jingjiang　Zhang Jingjiang, Vice President of the Games, praised the men's long jump competition a few days ago, and told people yesterday that before the opening of the Games, he expected that the results of the athletes from various places in this Games would only be improved compared with previous years. Now, the results of several types of competitions have broken the national record, which is really beyond our initial expectations. The Far Eastern Games is approaching the preparation period, and it is expected that the results of our country will only improve in the future. However, after the closing of the Far Eastern Games, the results obtained by our country will also be beyond our current expectations. He also said that the responsibility for China's results in the Far Eastern Games lies with the winning athletes from Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Shanghai. 　　Mr. Dai is the President of the Games, and Mr. Zhang is the Vice President of the Games. Their talks all hold infinite expectations for the teams of Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Shanghai, which is enough to represent the psychology of most of the audience. The reporter has also heard people talking about the words of Mr. Dai and Mr. Zhang in the tennis court, soccer court, the Games organizing committee, and the athletes' dormitory for several consecutive days. I will record it to inform my fellow athletes from Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Shanghai, and to comfort the people of our country. 　　Lin Zeren's photo of the first Liaoning team in the 1600-meter relay.</p>
<h3>All-Around Athletics</h3>
<p>First Place: Shanghai… Second Place: Liaoning　　Third Place: Tianjin… Fourth Place: Guangdong　　Fifth Place: Hunan… Sixth Place: Beiping and Harbin　　The Shanghai Team Benefits from the Pole Vault　　Liaoning's Chief Loses in the High Hurdles　　Tianjin's Strength Lies in the Relay Race　　The All-Around Athletics ended, with Shanghai winning the championship, with a total of 36 points. Second place: Liaoning, with a total of 20 points. Third place: Tianjin, with a total of 14 points. Fourth place: Guangdong, with a total of 10 points. Fifth place: Hunan, with a total of 4 points. Sixth place: Beiping and Heilongjiang, with 2 points each. In the All-Around Athletics, Liaoning had hope, and in the first half of the ten events, Zhang Lingjia occupied the first position with 505 points. Unexpectedly, in the high hurdles event, he scored zero points because he knocked down three hurdles, otherwise he would have had a considerable position. Cao Yuzhi of the Shanghai team won the victory, which should be attributed to the pole vault, with a score of 3.38 meters, which is better than the Games record. The Tianjin team was successful because its talents were average and they could all fight especially hard, winning the 800-meter relay championship.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Ball Game Results</h3>
<p>Baseball</p>
<p>Semifinals　　Tianjin Wins Against Shanghai　　Result: 4 to 1　　Finals with Hong Kong Tomorrow　　Yesterday at 2 pm, the Shanghai-Tianjin baseball semifinals took place. The referees were Zhang Xinfu and Yue Xiurong. The players on both sides were originally the best of the best. Now, at this critical juncture, each side gave their all to reach the finals and win the Games championship. Liu Dacheng and Lu Guanxiang, famous players from Shanghai, rushed to the venue by special car, while the good players from Tianjin practiced on the field every day. Both sides were so well prepared. At that time, there were more than a hundred spectators in the baseball field, watching the progress of each game and making considerable contributions. The first and sixth innings were especially exciting. In the first inning, Shanghai scored first and got one point. In the sixth inning, Tianjin made a concerted effort and turned defeat into victory. As a result, Tianjin won 4-1 and got the right to the finals. Tomorrow at 2 pm, Tianjin will play against Hong Kong in the finals. At that time, the two heroes will stand side by side, and there will be a fierce battle. On that day, the pitcher for Tianjin was Lin Xiping, the reliever was Gu Degang, the pitcher for Shanghai was An Lesheng, and the reliever was Liu Dacheng. Among the pitchers of the two teams, Tianjin's arm strength was strong and never tired. Shanghai was also good at first, but later suddenly became indecisive and lacked strength when throwing the ball, so he was replaced. Liu Dacheng was more experienced.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Scored First</h3>
<p>Zeng Guangbang of Shanghai occupied first base with the first hit. Chen Yutian followed. Zeng Guangbang took the opportunity to steal the base and succeeded again and again. When it was Lu Guanxiang's turn to hit, the whole audience paid attention, because whether or not a point could be scored depended on Lu's wrist. Lu hit hard, and the ball flew high into the sky, falling to the left side of the field. The ball was obtained by Ping Chaoliang. When he threw it back to the receiver, Zeng had safely reached the base and scored a point. Shanghai scored first.</p>
<h3>Both Sides Held Their Ground</h3>
<p>From the second inning to the fifth inning, the pitchers on both sides showed their unique skills, and the hitters had few opportunities to advance. Occasionally, they reached first or second base, but soon they were forced off the field. Both sides held their ground, and they could not cross the line.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Turned Defeat into Victory</h3>
<p>In the sixth inning, Shanghai went off the field, and it was Tianjin's turn to hit the ball. At this time, it was almost over. A slight mistake would affect the overall situation. The two teams were cautious and focused all their attention. Feng Chaoliang of Tianjin succeeded with one hit and occupied first base. Since then, he was full of energy, worked hard, and went straight in, as if entering an uninhabited place. Shanghai made repeated mistakes, and the line was chaotic, and it was getting worse and worse. Feng Chaoliang, Bao Wenpei, Lin Rongbin, and Lin Xiping of Tianjin returned to the base one after another. In the last inning (the seventh inning), Shanghai tried to recover, but the morale was not strong. The first two people lost and retreated. Although Lu occupied second base, he finally failed. As a result, Tianjin won 4-1. Lin Zeren's photo of Liu Changchun preparing to start the 1600-meter relay.</p>

<h3>Men's Volleyball</h3>
<p>Second Match: Hong Kong Beats Shanghai　　…Result: 2 to 0　　Performance of the Two Teams Reaches Perfection　　Three Thousand Spectators Marvel at the Spectacle　　At 1 pm on the 6th, the second match of the Hong Kong and Shanghai teams for the volleyball championship was one of the most exciting scenes of the competition in a week. One is the champion of South China, who has long held the top spot in East Asia, and the other is the hero of Shanghai, who has always been famous throughout the country. Once they meet, each has the determination to win the championship. The competition between them can be predicted before the battle. Lin Zeren's photo of men's relay race relaying.</p>
<p>The intensity of the competition is not something that can be predicted before the battle. At 3:15 pm, the reporter entered the venue and saw that the east and west stands were full, with people as many as ants. The north and south circles were surrounded by five or six layers of people, looking up and leading, fearing that they would fall behind the volleyball game. And the volleyball game has such a great appeal, which is no less than the 8th National Games held in Shanghai before. The depth of art's appeal has reached this point. I can't help but congratulate the future of Chinese sports.</p>
<h3>Grand Occasion Before the Start of the Game</h3>
<p>When it was almost 1 pm, the two teams entered the field in military uniforms. The Hong Kong team members wore red vests and velvet trousers, which were bright and dazzling. The Shanghai team wore blue vests and trousers, which felt even more elegant. Photographers from various newspapers scrambled to take pictures, as if they knew in advance that this scene was the key to the championship. After several warm-up exercises, the referee gave an order, and this extremely colorful and magical volleyball battle began in the shouts of thousands of spectators.</p>
<h3>Two Heroes Meet, Strength is Balanced</h3>
<p>The players of the two teams are all famous veterans, and their strength is comparable. Therefore, at the beginning of the game, each was wary of each other and dared not be careless. Hong Kong served first and failed first. Shanghai followed, but also gained nothing. Hong Kong served again and scored a point, opening the record first. Then Shanghai also scored a point, forming a draw. At this time, the competition was extremely fierce. The forwards jumped up to counterattack, and the defenders squatted down to wait, like living dragons and tigers. The ball hovered around the left and right of the net, sometimes south and sometimes north. It was really a spectacle. And the Hong Kong team also gradually progressed from then on, taking the lead with 6 to 4.</p>
<h3>Turn the Tide, Shanghai Counterattacks</h3>
<p>Seeing that the opponent was coming fiercely, the Shanghai team knew that it was not enough to resist without fighting hard, so they gathered their energy and worked hard to support. The situation turned suddenly. The Hong Kong team's two serves were difficult to succeed. Shanghai gained a point from it, forming a ratio of 5 to 6.</p>
<h3>Surprise Victory, Hong Kong Succeeded</h3>
<p>Hong Kong's repeated attacks were ineffective, so they changed their strategy and used the plan of flanking from both wings. The central army only took care of responding, and often entrusted the ball to both sides. The middle row of left and right wings then slammed the point where the ball landed, as fast as arrows, all in the left and right corners of the Shanghai side. Suddenly left and suddenly right, repeatedly hitting the key points. The Shanghai team was uncertain, taking care of this and losing that. It was really impossible for them to defend, and it was difficult to defend. Hong Kong was a smooth sailing, and had a winning momentum of 11 to 5.</p>
<h3>Re-energize After Changing Positions</h3>
<p>After changing positions, the Hong Kong team won victory after victory. Three serves added three more points. After this painful blow, the whole Shanghai team became more angry and worked together to strive forward. Sure enough, they also increased four points one after another, creating a situation of 14 to 9. The Women's Track and Field Championship: Harbin and Guangdong tied for first place.</p>
<h3>Previous Scores Are All Cancelled</h3>
<p>The Dispute Over the Race is Resolved Satisfactorily　　Relay Race…Guangdong Does Not Appear…Harbin Refuses to Wait…</p>
<p>He Yingqin, etc.…Adjust the Suspension…Both Parties Agree</p>
<p>The dispute over the women's 200-meter relay race has been resolved satisfactorily. Heilongjiang has agreed to replay, but when the time came, four athletes from Heilongjiang appeared and waited for a long time, but the Guangdong team did not arrive. The referee reported that it would be postponed again. Heilongjiang protested strongly and argued for a long time. After mediation by He Yingqin, Dai Jitao, Zhu Jiahua, etc., it was decided that there would be no more competition. The women's track and field championship, Heilongjiang and Guangdong were tied for first place, and the previous scores were cancelled and not counted. Both parties agreed and the matter was resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<h3>Chen Xibing of Hong Kong Made Great Contributions</h3>
<p>When the two sides were in a stalemate, Chen Xibing of the Hong Kong team bravely attacked. That pressing ball skill can be called unique. He repeatedly used his superb skills of rapid and high pressure to attack the opponent, and the ball he hit could be successful as he wished. None of the Shanghai players were able to save it. It is really a strange person with strange skills. According to a certain expert who invited volleyball, Mr. Chen is not only the soul of the Hong Kong team, but also the top player in East Asia. The reporter witnessed his high level of technology Lin Zeren's photo of the women's 200-meter relay team from Heilongjiang, from right to left: Wang Yuan, Liu Jingzhen, Wu Meixian, Sun Guiyun. It is not an exaggeration to say that he is high-skilled. Later, the Hong Kong team became more and more courageous, and when Chen Xibing served the ball, he won the first game with 21 to 14.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Shanghai Changed Again in the Replay</h3>
<p>After a few minutes of rest, the whole team continued to fight. The Shanghai team shook its spirit, and the ball situation changed greatly. They took the lead with 4 to 3, and then formed a situation of 7 to 3. At that time, the audience's psychology was that Shanghai had the hope of winning. Unexpectedly, the battle situation was unpredictable. Although the Hong Kong team suffered a small setback, they still maintained a calm attitude, and the line was more consolidated. Taking advantage of the gaps to attack, they never made a mistake. Before long, they turned to win with 17 to 14. After this, the Shanghai team gradually felt uneasy. Although brave generals such as Cao Renjiang and Li Xinbiao were also helpless, sitting and watching the opponent attack, they had little power to fight back. The truth is that the chess skill is higher, and the hands and feet are difficult to deal with. This is really because the strength is not as good as the battle.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Bravely Won the Victory</h3>
<p>After a few more rounds, the Hong Kong team's momentum became stronger and stronger, and the score increased again and again. They also won the right to the competition by winning two consecutive games with 21 to 14. The referee was Tan Tianpei. The lineups of the two teams are on the left.</p>

<h3>Nanjing Won Against Beiping in the Second Match</h3>
<p>Ratio of Two to Zero　　Nanjing Ball　Good Skills　In the second match of the men's volleyball, Nanjing won against Beiping, two to zero. In the competition order, the preliminary match was originally scheduled for Beiping against Henan. Beijing was empty because Henan did not arrive. Beiping won the right to the second match. At 3 pm on the 6th, the two teams faced off at the volleyball court. The Nanjing team members were all from Guangdong and Fujian and had a good foundation in this kind of ball game. The Beiping team had less experience and lacked coordination. The first game was plain and unexciting. Nanjing won with 21 to 4. The Beiping team improved slightly, but their strength was not enough and they could not compete with each other in the end. They lost again with 12 to 21. As a result, Nanjing won two to zero. The referee was Gao Xigan.</p>

<h3>Beiping Won Against Zhejiang in the Second Match of Men's Basketball</h3>
<p>Seventy-Five to Twenty-Four　　Beiping's First Appearance　　A total of 20 teams participated in this basketball championship, among which Tianjin, Shanghai, Beiping, Kobe, and Liaoning were the strongest. Beiping was originally scheduled to play against Hunan in the preliminary match. Hunan was absent, so today's battle was the first appearance of the team. The team is famous in Beiping and Tianjin, and its strength is not weak. It has a great ambition to win the championship.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang's Ball Skills Are Not Weak</h3>
<p>Zhejiang won against Suiyuan with 62 to 26 in the preliminary match, and then won against Anhui with 36 to 15 in the second week of the competition. Judging from its results, it cannot be underestimated. The two teams are evenly matched, and it is expected that the competition will be fierce. The audience gathered, and the seats were full, especially the military. Pieces of yellow were very beautiful.</p>
<h3>First Half Ends in Victory</h3>
<p>Referee Qian Yiqin, Inspector Liu Yaokun, Zhong pointed down, and the fierce battle began. Beiping center Wang Yuzeng dribbled the ball to Chen Shengkui, Chen did not hesitate, and quickly passed it to left forward Zhao Borong. Zhao saw an excellent opportunity and quickly threw it towards the basket.</p>
<p>Hoping to open the scoring, unexpectedly the ball hit the iron hoop slightly and fell to the side. Zhejiang got the ball and counter-attacked, but also missed. For about seven minutes, there were still no points on the scoreboard. Later, Zhejiang got a free throw opportunity, and center Zhou Zuomin scored one point. Beiping saw Zhejiang taking the lead, and everyone perked up their spirits, bravely moving forward. Chen Shengkui scored repeatedly, and Wang Yuzeng also scored three times in a row, increasing the score frequently. Zhejiang then adjusted Yao Liang to be the left forward. Yao Liang was agile and scored two goals as soon as he joined. Beiping's Zhao Borong dribbled the ball and attacked, single-handedly driving straight in, but missed the shot. Wang Li, with his tall stature, patted the ball three times, and it rolled into the net. The result of the first half was 27 to 5, with Beiping winning.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Unable to Recover</h3>
<p>In the second half, Zhejiang scored first again, but Beiping was unwilling to relax, using more aerial passes. Their tall stature gave them a lot of advantage. Zhejiang's passes were stagnant, and Wu Guolin's shots were quite accurate, but there was no teamwork, and his teammates could only sigh at the basket. After Zhao Borong of Beiping scored ten points in a row, their momentum was like adding fuel to the fire, unstoppable. The score increased with time. Zhejiang's formation gradually became chaotic, and morale wavered, leading to an irreversible situation. As a result, they lost with a score of 75 to 24.</p>

<p>It is not yet known who will win. Less than a minute into the game, Guangdong's Lu Huilan scored the first point. Nanjing's counterattack was fierce, but they were too hasty and did not succeed. In the second quarter, Nanjing's offense intensified and gradually improved, scoring eight points in a row, but soon Guangdong caught up again. At the end of the first half, it was</p>
<p>14 to 8, Nanjing was 6 points behind.</p>
<p>Switching sides, both sides made more progress. Guangdong's passing was skillful and their shooting was accurate. Their momentum was strong.

At the finish line, Guangdong was first, Tianjin second, and Shanghai third, with very little distance between them. Liaoning was in sixth place.</p>
<h3>Final Struggle</h3>
<p>After the second and third runners took over, the positions of each team did not change much, with Guangdong first, Tianjin second, Shanghai third, and Liaoning sixth. When the last runner took over, it was the highlight of the final. The athletes from each team, such as Liu Changchun, Zhong Lianji, and Zhou Zhaoyuan, were all sprinters, so the struggle was particularly intense. Tianjin's Zhou Zhaoyuan overtook Guangdong's Liang Jingping in the last hundred meters. At the same time, Liu Changchun also tried hard to catch up. At about 112 meters from the finish line, he was less than one meter behind Shanghai's Zhong Lianji. After crossing the finish line, Liu gritted his teeth and barely surpassed Zhong Lianji by one meter, taking third place. Tianjin was first, Guangdong second, and Shanghai fourth, with a time of one minute, 48 and 5/2 seconds.</p>

<h3>Beiping Initially Shows Talent</h3>
<p>Surprisingly Amazing</p>
<p>The women's basketball game between Beiping and Zhejiang was the finale of the day. Both sides were showing their skills for the first time, and outsiders knew nothing about their strength. The competition started at 3 o'clock. Beiping attacked first, and Zhejiang's basket seemed to be the target of everyone, unable to resist. The first half ended 30 to 0, with Zhejiang getting nothing. In the second half, both sides committed many fouls. Zhejiang also had more than ten free throw opportunities, but the free throwers were flustered and did not score. At the end of the third quarter, Zhejiang still had a goose egg. In the fourth quarter, Zhejiang's Si Yasha scored two points on a free throw, and then Zheng scored another goal, finalizing the result of the game at 56 to 4. Beiping's players were well-rounded, each agile and lively. Their skillful passing and accurate shooting were rare among other teams. Their defense was also quite solid, especially Huang, Peng, Wei Yi, Dai, and others were the most outstanding. In the future semi-finals and finals, they can compete with Guangdong and Shanghai for the championship. The final score was 56 to 4, Beiping won. The scores of each quarter were 13|0, 17|0, 10|0, 16|4. Beiping Players Fouls Technical Fouls Points</p>

<p>The Shanghai team is a disguised version of Lehua and has held the top position in East China football for several years. Moreover, it has been promoted, not only as a leading team in East China, but also holding the key position in national football. Last year, the team's southern expedition</p>
<p>Returned in triumph, which was praised by overseas Chinese and admired by people all over the country. The Guangdong athletes are products of China's natural football region, possessing both intelligence and courage, and are exceptionally lively. Their running is like arrows, their kicking is like bullets, their passing is rapid, their receiving is steady, they are well-rounded inside and out, and everyone is strong. In the previous game against Jiangxi, their "talent has already been revealed, no need for the reporter to elaborate." It is now known that the two teams are scheduled to hold a semi-final at the football field at 3:00 PM today. The outcome of this game can determine who belongs to the championship, so today's battle is no less than the general football competition of the conference.

<h3>Chairman Hosts Banquet for Referees</h3>
<p>Contributions on the Spot</p>
<p>The chairman and vice-chairman of the National Games hosted a banquet for all the referees at 7 PM last night. Halfway through the banquet, Chairman Dai said that the Games were proceeding smoothly thanks to everyone's support. The work of the sports referees is difficult, and they have been working hard day and night for the past six days. We are very grateful. I feel that sports occupy an important position in education. This Games is sponsored by the central government, and the scale is Fifth Place in Shanghai's Wang Jihuai Photo by Wang Kai</p>
<p>Large and the participation is enthusiastic, which is unprecedented. All the difficult problems that have arisen in the past few days are seen as a daunting task by the staff and referees. If held every year in the future, the experience gained can be used to improve. This is an unavoidable stage in today's infancy of Chinese sports. This is my first contribution to you. Secondly, I hope that experts in sports will change the terminology to Chinese language. You can organize a group to specialize in reviewing various terms and then use the reviewed terminology as the standard language in sports, so that the general public can easily understand it. This is my second contribution to you. Finally, I wish you good health, progress in sports, and a strong nation. The banquet ended at 10 PM.</p>
<h3>Delegation Meeting</h3>
<p>Several Proposals Passed</p>
<p>On April 5, representatives from various provinces and cities held a meeting and elected Zhang Jiwu as temporary chairman and Ma Zanyi as secretary. The items discussed were: 1. Li Yiusheng from Dongte proposed that a general representative assembly of provinces and cities be organized first, which was passed. 2. Discussed Zhao Wenzao Throwing the Discus, Photo by Wang Kai</p>
<p>The regulations were passed. 3. The Presidium was elected, with Li Yiusheng, Jin Zhaojun, and Ma Zanyi elected to form the Presidium. If anyone leaves Hangzhou, representatives from Shandong and Tianjin, etc. will fill the vacancies. Li Tiejian and Zhong Jun were appointed as secretaries, and Chen Boqing as administrative officer. 4. Jin Zhaojun from Nanjing proposed that the delegation ask the Games to clearly explain the amateur and non-amateur standards and on what regulations they are based and that a reply should be given quickly, which was passed. 5. Zhong Jun from Qingdao proposed that the delegation propose to the Games that the finish line referees should be responsible for the error in the number of laps for athlete number 124 in the 10,000-meter race, which was passed. 6. Dongte proposed Women's Relay Race Hand-Off Photo by Lin Zeren</p>
<p>That the referee's arbitrary decision in the women's relay race should be protested. 7. Li Jiantie, the representative from Hebei, proposed that the Games should announce the types and quantities of prizes received from various regions and the method of distributing the prizes. 8. Beiping proposed the case of No. 504 in the 10,000-meter final. 9. Although General Secretary Ma was responsible for answering the proposal of Guan Sanhao, many have not yet been fulfilled and a clear answer should be requested, which was passed.</p>
<p>The above proposals for the fourth, fifth, sixth, and eighth items, as well as the protest letters from the representatives, were submitted to the Games by the Presidium yesterday. The protests from the representatives are listed below:</p>
<p>Dongte's Proposal The Dongte proposal is to protest the arbitrary refereeing of the finish line referee in the women's 200-meter relay race. The reasons are: (1) The examiner checked the second place referee's form and filled in No. 77 in the grid, then No. 77 is the second place, without any objection. (2) The examiner checked the athlete number column on the first place referee's form and wrote No. 462 in capital letters in the main grid, with a small note above saying "No. 77", which is obviously a later addition. (3) Assuming that No. 462 and No. 77 reached the finish line at the same time, then the referee's form for the second place should be left blank or the number of the third place should be recorded directly.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Weile Garden Bicycle Performance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Weile Garden Bicycle Group is the only organization in our country that promotes bicycle racing. They are well-trained in Shanghai, but have never been seen by our people. It is said that the staff of the garden are skilled and pay close attention to their daily life, diet, etc., to ensure that everyone's life is in order to maintain their health. This special trip to Hangzhou to perform at the National Games, which is watched by the whole country, will surely refresh the audience and add color to the Games. Sixteen or seventeen technicians will perform at the track and field at 1:00 PM this afternoon. With the technology of the garden, it will definitely be welcomed by the public. If the Chinese people can pay attention to bicycle racing in the future and achieve excellent results, the program is as follows: (1) Preliminary, four times, two people per group, four laps around the field, (2) Semi-finals, (3) 10,000-meter race, (4) Losers' championship, (5) 15-minute race, (6) Finals.</p>
<p>Bits and Pieces</p>
<h3>Understanding the Basics</h3>
<p>Zhao Dexin, who won the 10,000-meter championship, whose results have set a new national record, told reporters that since arriving in Hangzhou from Liaoning, he did not dare to eat too much every day, but sipped a little thin porridge, because white rice is not something he is used to, and eating it may affect his stomach and be bad for running, so he would rather endure hunger to win this championship. However, on the night of that day, he ate a lot to compensate for the deficit in his stomach.</p>
<h3>Acting as Good News</h3>
<p>Shanghai Wang Kai Photo Studio has been taking many photos of various achievements at the Games for days. The washing is very fast. The winning athletes have been buying them to commemorate, and some have sent them back first, acting as good news.</p>
<h3>Good Intentions</h3>
<p>The women's 200-meter relay was scheduled for 1:00 PM yesterday, and Harbin and Guangdong had a rematch. After mediation, both sides agreed. The four young ladies from Harbin actually used sugarcane as a baton in the rest room to practice the handoff, which can be said to be well-intentioned.</p>
<h3>Really Embarrassing</h3>
<p>The women's basketball game between Guangdong and Nanjing Special Municipality yesterday was very exciting, but Guangdong won in the end. The audience around applauded and cheered. Before the cheers subsided, a Guangdong Western-dressed youth on the highest row of the west stand sat high on it and repeated several cheers, happy and forgetting himself, almost falling down. A woman of marriageable age below the stand said ("Only heard" him cheering alone, aren't you embarrassed?"</p>
<h3>At the Right Moment</h3>
<p>There is a temporary store in Guanhang Garden, south of the football field, and the business is very prosperous. However, the location is just in line with the rush of the goal, so in the past few days, the strength of both sides has often been uneven, so that the ball has been bouncing and flying around the area.</p>
<h3>A Big Show</h3>
<p>The food needed for the Games every day is as follows: 13 dan of rice, more than 26,000 steamed buns, 50 dan of firewood, 200 jin of soy sauce, 1 dan of soybean oil, 50 jin of salt, 400 jin of bamboo shoots, and more than 200 jin of meat. Such a large account is amazing. The large kitchen needs to prepare 500 to 600 tables every day, and there are a total of 144 cooks and 12 steamed bun makers.</p>
<h3>Willing to be Inferior</h3>
<p>Yesterday the weather suddenly warmed up, and the audience was sweating profusely, and there were clouds of men and women, and after being scorched by the sun, they felt more charming and lovely, with a spring atmosphere. Fragrant sweat was revealed, and they took out their scented handkerchiefs to wipe it, with the idea of ​​who is fortunate enough to be in the downwind.</p>
<h3>After Returning Home</h3>
<p>The Jinling Theater Troupe has been performing dramas in the guest house of the conference these days. The general athletes have this entertainment, and the comfort is self-evident. Yesterday, they also performed the play "After Returning Home." The name Gu Ming En Xi tells what kind of images will arise after the Games are over and the winners and losers return home.</p>
<h3>Returning Fully Loaded</h3>
<p>The conference is about to close in an instant, and the athletes leave in their spare time and buy local products in Hangzhou, such as folding fans, tea, and lotus root powder, so that they can be used as souvenirs of their trip to Hangzhou when they return.</p>
<h3>Results of the Industrial and Commercial Football Game Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday the weather was clear and the wind was gentle. The Industrial and Commercial Amateur Football Competition held at the City No. 1 Public Sports Ground, starting from 7:30 in the morning until 6:00 in the afternoon, with seven consecutive games, was very lively. The results are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Team wins/losses Group Achievement</p>
<p>Qiangnan wins Lechen Zhi 1 to 0</p>
<p>City South vs. West District Ren 1 to 1</p>

<h3>Various Places Send Personnel to Participate in the National Education Conference</h3>
<p>The National Education Conference is not far away. At a time when there are military operations in the North and the South, some outsiders believe that the conference may be affected by the military, and it may be difficult for representatives from various provinces to gather completely. In fact, education has nothing to do with military affairs. In the past, during the warlord era, there were wars between the North and the South, but education was still consistent. A few years ago, the National Education Conference was held in Henan, Beijing and other places, in the autumn of the war between the North and the South. Representatives from various provinces still gathered to express the good spirit of educational unity. Even the northern and remote provinces still sent representatives to participate in the National Education Conference. It is heard that the Ministry of Education has received telegrams from northern and remote provinces in recent days to report on the list of participants, with several starting every day. The probes are recorded below: The Director of the Hebei Provincial Department of Education sent Li Zheng to attend first, the Shanxi Education Office sent Guo Chongzhen, the Sui sent Gong Guohua, the chief of the school education section, the Heilongjiang Department of Education personally attended, the Qingdao Social Bureau Director telegraphed to send the School Education Stock Yesterday's 800-meter Relay Race, Photo by Wang Kai</p>
<p>Director Wang Bingheng to attend the meeting, the Director of the Hunan Department of Education and Huang Dujie, the Director of the Xiangtan Education Bureau, attended together, Zheng Hongnian of Jinan University personally attended, and another message, the Ministry of Education also sent Zhou Gan, Xie Shuying, Wang Jinxin, and Wang Linggen, four gentlemen, to be the editorial section staff of the National Education Conference.</p>
<h3>Recent News of the National Boy Scout General Inspection</h3>
<p>The reason for holding the general inspection is to promote the purpose of Boy Scout training in China, which is to develop children's ability to do things, cultivate habits of self-reliance and mutual assistance, love of country, nation, and humanity, as well as courage and sacrifice. This aims to make their character noble, their knowledge rich, and their physique sound, so that they can earnestly continue the Three Principles of the People revolution, gradually realizing a nation of, by, and for the people, and ultimately achieving universal harmony. This is not military education. The headquarters of the Chinese Boy Scouts is holding this national general inspection and grand camping event in accordance with the above purposes, to assess past achievements and use them as a basis for future comprehensive improvements. The period is from the 16th to the 21st. In addition to the general inspection ceremony and grand camping, the program includes a supplementary swearing-in ceremony for the commander and various competitions, gatherings, recreational performances, etc., to promote children's outdoor life, connect friendships, increase knowledge, and engage in social service, promoting the spirit of the Boy Scouts under the leadership of the Three Principles of the People, and arousing national attention to the Boy Scout cause. There are no military exercises.</p>
<p>Hunan Boy Scouts Go to Beijing: The Training Department of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, under instruction, is preparing for the Hunan Boy Scouts to go to Beijing to participate in the national general inspection. Hu Guochun is specially appointed to be responsible for guidance, and Peng Yunbin, Bao Dunpu, Jiang Yinan, Hu Jingsheng, Huang Pinle, and Xia Dexin are assigned to assist. A working office of Boy Scout members from various schools is organized to actively prepare for the selection of one squad from Mingde School and five squads each from Yueyun and Dalü Schools within the province, totaling</p>
<p>one hundred people. They will rehearse various actions to participate in the general inspection. Its organization is divided into five sections: document, management, discipline, communication, and recreation, with one director and several staff members for each section, elected by the participants going to Beijing. An office is formed to oversee everything. The required expenses are subsidized by the government with 800 yuan, allocated for each person's round-trip travel and food expenses (three [角] per person per day).</p>
<p>The remaining expenses are to be borne by each group. The uniform is all yellow clothes, yellow hat, green socks, and leather shoes, with a blue flag with white characters, crowned with the character "湘" (Xiang, for Hunan). It is scheduled to depart from Changsha by train to Hubei on April 8, then transfer to Beijing. It is planned to gather at the Provincial Steering Committee at 3 PM on March 28, and after an inspection in Xinkai Shop outside the South Gate, they will continue camping there for three days and two nights, practicing various outdoor activities. The Provincial Training Department has notified the Boy Scouts of various schools to bring a full set of camping gear to the designated location for gathering, inspection, and practice by the due date.</p>
<h3>Instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Regarding Elementary School Teachers</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education instructed the Director of the Songjiang County Bureau of Education, saying: A document was submitted requesting modification of the detailed rules for the examination and certification of elementary school teachers, requesting review and compliance. The matter is understood. The measures for unqualified elementary school teacher training classes were originally established to alleviate the shortage of teachers in various counties. If unqualified elementary school teachers are all replaced without being used, counties with a shortage of teachers will inevitably experience difficulties for a time. Therefore, those who pass the training class are allowed to temporarily serve, but they should still be subject to examination and certification at the time of the examination to determine whether their academic ability is sufficient. Those who pass are given a permit, formally recognized as elementary school teachers. Article 9 of the Jiangsu Provincial Detailed Rules for the Examination and Certification of Elementary School Teachers, previously promulgated by this department,</p>
<p>shows the importance attached to elementary school teachers and the consideration given to the shortage of teachers in various counties. However, Xu Zhenya, Sheng Dan, and others do not understand the situation and want to be exempt from examination and certification, the same as graduates of normal school, based on the strength of half a year of training, which is extremely absurd. The request should not be discussed. The director should clearly explain this. This order.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Middle School Teachers' Union Petitions for Reorganization of Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Middle School Teachers' Union, concerned that the proposed change of the Education Fund Management Office of more than twenty provinces to the Shanghai-Jiangsu Provincial Education Fund Management Office would affect the education funds of Jiangsu Province, recently sent representatives to the Department of Education and the Provincial Government to petition for it. Secretary Huang of the Department of Education met with the representatives. The representatives stated the petition's opinions. Mr. Huang stated that the Department of Education would never undermine education funds and said that he had submitted a request to the Provincial Government to pay attention. Chairman Ye [of the Provincial Government] received them. Mr. Ye said that the independence of education funds is a matter of course. Since he had come to assume political responsibility for Jiangsu Province, he certainly could not ignore this matter and would request and communicate with the relevant central government agencies. In addition, the representatives pointed out that the central government had previously compensated Jiangsu Province's education funds with 1.8 million yuan of land tax due to the recovery of cigarette tax, but it had not actually been implemented, and that the back wages owed to teachers and staff of various schools had not been paid. They asked the Provincial Government and the Department of Education to find a solution.</p>

<h3>Delicacies of Hubei</h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>Wuchang Carp Sashimi</p>
<p>I once read a poem by Dongpo, praising "The Yangtze River encircles the city, knowing the fish are delicious."</p>
<p>In recent times, a famous person also wrote the line, "Wine jugs heavily discuss Wuchang fish."</p>
<p>I am quite fond of fish and have always wanted to taste its flavor but had no way to do so. This spring, I traveled to Hubei Province. Together with several friends, I ascended the Yellow Crane Tower. Gazing at the Yangtze River in the distance, the sky and water were the same color. New willows hid crows, fishing boats sang in the evening, and the gentle breeze was warm. The scenery was pleasant. Therefore, I drank with friends at a wine shop to express my traveling pleasure. During the banquet, white clams and green snails, early chives and new bamboo shoots were laid out. The taste was palatable. Following that, a plate of carp sashimi was served. It was fatty, tender, and delicious, far surpassing chicken and pork. Comparing it to pufferfish and the Chinese perch, it seemed even [better]. Only then did I believe that the praise of the ancients was not false. Thus, I ordered more sashimi and drank more wine. The setting sun was about to darken. I returned home drunk. While drinking, I asked the waiter at the wine shop. According to him, the Yangtze River is vast and the water is lively. The fish all taste delicious, but carp is considered the best. Moreover, it must be caught by fishermen below the Yellow Crane Tower, and the eyes must be vermilion in color to be considered authentic. This is because the waters of the Xiang and Han Rivers rush down rapidly and violently until they reach the Yellow Crane Shoal, where they gradually become calm. The fish can rest, and the taste is particularly delicious. If caught elsewhere, even if it is fatty, it is not tender, and even if it is tender, it is not fatty, and it cannot be both.</p>
<p>Hangaog 紫苋 (Purple Amaranth)</p>
<p>East of Hangao's first city's main street, there used to be "Xiao Xiang Lake," also named "Yellow Flower Land." Recently, due to the construction of high dikes upstream in Hubei, the vast sea has become mulberry fields, and the marshland has suddenly become magnificent buildings. Although the marketplaces are prosperous, the fields are still vast. Farmers and gardeners make their living by planting spring chives, autumn cabbage, purple water chestnuts, and silver lotus roots. The soil is fertile and the vegetable gardens are lush. There is a purple amaranth, whose juice is like rouge, beautifully red, and tastes like spring bamboo shoots, but even more crisp and tender. It is a specialty of that area. However, those who carry it on their shoulders and sell it in the streets are all from other places and are all counterfeits. Therefore, buyers must go to the place of origin and pick it from the vegetable beds of the gardeners to get the best product. When the sun is about to set, they tie the grass, store it in baskets, and carry it home in an endless stream. In Hangan customs, on the day of the Beginning of Summer festival, every household prepares dishes with this vegetable to celebrate the season, just like the wormwood wine on the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Spring Purification Ritual at Plum Garden</h3>
<p>— Fei Meng Die</p>
<p>On the day of Geng Wu, my old friend Xie Jiezhi suddenly came from the sea. It had been a year since our parting in Liangxi. I was very happy to see him. He brought a painting of plum blossoms by the owner of Plum Garden as a gift. His elder brother, Gongzhan, painted the branches, and his wife, Shimin, painted the flowers. The inscription was Jiezhi's own calligraphy of his old work, "Ode to Plum Blossoms in the Five Lakes." It was a rare combination of beauty and could be called a "three-perfection." Old friends Bai Xi, Tiao Fu, also came. We spent a long time admiring the painting together. I thought of the wonderful events of admiring plum blossoms under the moon with my friends Shou Juan and others last spring, as if it were happening before my eyes. Now, the plum blossoms have all fallen, and they have become a beloved memory. Fortunately, the peach blossoms are blooming, and the green leaves have not yet provided shade. Moreover, I am glad that I, a former Liu Lang, did not come too late like Du Mu. The host, De Gong, because of the arrival of distinguished guests from afar and because it was the auspicious time for the ancient spring purification ritual, happily invited Jiezhi and myself to tour the garden. We went by car and arrived in an instant. The road through the garden was full of peach blossoms. Yesterday's Sea of Fragrant Snow had suddenly changed into the Red City Glow. Below the Heavenly Heart Terrace, by the edge of the winding pool, several graceful trees were exceptionally enchanting. Vaguely, it was like Xishi of Ruoye, washing silk by the stream, reflecting the shadows of fish. Behind it, there was a white peach tree, whose flowers were particularly abundant. Its crystalline appearance and jade-like purity were captivating. Lady Xi stood silently, and that alone was enough to be enchanting. Jiezhi could not help but recite my poem, "The Kingdom of Guo can only boast of its plain face, how could Wenjun bear to wear red silk." There was also a type of "spotted peach", where each flower had alternating red and white colours, like the powdered faces and rouge marks of a beautiful woman with painted lips - a truly wondrous sight. In front of Song Bin Hall, we met Zhou Jun Jiwei. This gentleman was also an old acquaintance, humorous and interesting, which greatly added to the pleasure of the trip. We drank tea and took a short rest, then went to the study of Zhu Menghua. The room was full of books, and we looked through countless paintings and rubbings by famous artists. The most precious item was the calligraphy of Erquan Shanren brought by Zhou Jilao. To see flowers and this was a great treat for the guests. There was an ancient Qin in the room. Menghua pointed to it and said that it was a gift from a tea boy at the Taihu Hotel. The guests were surprised that such a person could be so refined. I laughed and said, "This is what they call a Nanjing vegetable seller who has the air of the Six Dynasties." As the sun set, we opened a bottle of wine at the Taihu Hotel. The number of guests and the host matched the number of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove. Jilao had experienced military service and spoke at length about the hardships of war and the history of the failure of the warlords during the banquet. His words were passionate and sad, full of colour and sound. The four listeners listened as if they were reading the Book of Han, making it a wonderful accompaniment to the wine. As the feast came to an end, the stars filled the sky, and shadows stretched across the ground. Our trip today was not just like the ancient event at the Orchid Pavilion, but also like Li Bai's spring night banquet in the peach and plum garden. How could this not be recorded?</p>
<h3>A Visit to Wang Gang's Personal Pattern Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>There are many exhibitions held in Shanghai. But never before one dedicated solely to patterns. If so, then Mr Wang Gang's personal pattern exhibition is indeed the first. Although the importance of pattern is known to the Chinese, many neglect it and do not pay attention to it. They watch industry fail and commerce decline, not knowing how to solve the problem from the root. They only sigh at the influx of foreign goods, forgetting that domestic goods are crude and lack artistic thought, unable to arouse the interest of buyers. Therefore, the call to promote domestic goods, although very noisy, is ultimately useless. Mr. Wang Gang once studied</p>
<p>patterns at the Beijing Art School and was already different from others. Later, he went to Tokyo to specialize in pattern design. Not seen for six or seven years, he suddenly opened a personal pattern exhibition at the Ningbo Association. This opened a new era for exhibitions in Shanghai. In the future, as this path develops, this exhibition will be its origin. How can it not be recorded? Moreover, I have also studied this field. The "Method of Pattern," which I wrote, has long been published. So, hearing about this exhibition, I felt like I was hearing a "footstep in an empty valley." The exhibition contains various patterns, about one hundred and fifty pieces. The composition is exquisite, the colors are gorgeous, the ideas are unique, and the tones are harmonious.</p>
<p>It can evoke a warm and pleasant feeling in the viewer. Moreover, it can combine the strengths of the Chinese, Western, and Japanese schools into one, which is even more commendable. There are fewer than ten people in the country who study pattern design, and most of them have a long relationship with me. Mr. Wang is truly a rising star and can be said to have surpassed his predecessors. So, I am happy to introduce him to the people of the country. The exhibition will run until July. Those who are interested in this field, as well as industrialists and merchants, should not miss the opportunity to visit and broaden their horizons. (No remuneration received)</p>
<h3>A Record of Viewing Cherry Blossoms and Hearing Cranes</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>I wake up very early in the morning, and it is my habit to take a walk of two or three li in the countryside. Nearby is the 63 Garden, which is where I especially like to rest. This is because the burning dust of the city needs to be expelled. There are dozens of cherry trees in the garden, all several fathoms high. Their branches stand tall among the stones, and the scenery is so clear and beautiful it could be painted. These days, the cherry trees are flowering. The flowers have five petals like plum blossoms and are light pink. Those still in bud are even more vibrant, like young women of eighteen or twenty with a hint of spring love. Looking at them makes one's soul melt away. The flowers are either sparse or dense. Looking at them from a distance, they are like mist and clouds. Wandering beneath them, sometimes the wind carries the petals and they land on my clothes, which is even more wonderful. To the left of the bridge, there are two white cranes in the stream, preening their wings. Occasionally they cry, their voices long and drawn out. This is what the ancients meant by the saying, "Cranes cry to the heavens." Many Japanese people live in the garden. One of them, Mr. Matsuoka Sanjiro, speaks fluent Chinese and is quite</p>
<p>friendly with me. He said that the late Wu Changshuo once visited this place and was so fond of the cranes that he immediately painted them. Their red crowns and white feathers, the way they seemed to fly and dance in the clouds, and their carefree and distant spirit were vividly expressed on paper. The painting is still in his suitcase, but Lao Gang has already passed away. Playing with it, I can't help but feel sad.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Records of Wan Hua's American Tour at the Jade Tassel Chamber</h3>
<p>— Lai</p>
<p>Since Wan Hua began performing "Farewell My Concubine" here, playwrights, actors, writers, singers, musicians, theater managers, etc., have come to watch every day without getting tired of it. After the play, they personally go backstage to express their opinions and feelings. One writer said that Mr. Mei's plays have rules and accurate places in every move and action, which are several times higher than American dramas. People say that Chinese dramas are old-fashioned, but from an artistic point of view, they are actually newer than the new American dramas. In the future, American dramas will be greatly affected, or their style will be changed, without a doubt. The president of the Theater Association also said that there are still many actors, singers, and musicians from various theaters here who are eager to see Mr. Mei's plays, but they are suffering from lack of time because they are all performing at the same time. Therefore, they hope that Mr. Mei will add a matinee performance on Thursdays so that all the colleagues in the theater industry can satisfy their desire to see and hear. Although Mr. Mei has matinee performances on Wednesdays and Saturdays, they also have matinee performances, so they still don't have time to spare. (This matter must be agreed to) Some say that "Fen He Wan" is the best because everyone can understand it. Some say that the sword dance posture is the best. Some say that "Ci La La Hu" is the best play. Some say that Chinese drama is very similar to Greek drama. Some say that the rules of Chinese drama are extremely wonderful. For example, at the appropriate time, the audience thinks that they should sing at this time, and the actors on the stage are already singing. There is nothing more pleasing than this. The opinions were numerous and cannot be fully described. Although there are some excessive praises, there are indeed many insightful words.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the performance, several large stores came to ask to display Wanhua's stage costumes in their stores as decorations. They are now displayed in several places, and the number of visitors is unusually crowded. Recently, several large theaters have sent invitations to visit, and the hospitality is extremely warm. Yesterday, a filmmaker came to the theater to shoot newsreels, only shooting a section of "Ci La La Hu." It is said that it will be screened tomorrow night. The entire crew will go to see it, and it is heard that the new film will be available nationwide within three days. Yesterday, we rehearsed "Chunxiang's Trouble at School" to prepare for future changes in the repertoire. "Drunkenness" and "Mulan Joins the Army" must also be performed. "The Legend of Taizhen" may also be re-edited and rehearsed.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Gleanings</h3>
<p>— Tang Binhua</p>
<p>Do not install a gourd-style light switch with electrical wires on an iron bed. Beware of the electrical wires breaking and coming into contact with the iron bed. It is very easy to cause electrocution to the person sleeping on the bed. How dangerous! This is common sense learned from experience. Do not hang a thermometer in a place where it is exposed to sunlight, because uneven heating will cause the reading to be inaccurate. When a child has hiccups that do not stop, try to make them cry. Then the hiccups will stop. When carrying silver money and encountering a bad person stalking you, just ask a street patrol for the name of a street. Then the bad person will think that you are going to report it to the patrol and will retreat.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (165)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Red Flames Rise, Prostitutes Admire the Filial Daughter. Red Rug Spread, Instant Meeting with Famous Actors</p>
<p>It was Lu Junfu who helped this group of people. They were unwilling to perform on that kind of shoddy stage. At that time, the new dramas in Shanghai had several problems. First, they didn't read scripts. Second, they didn't divide scenes. It was never clear how many scenes there were. Inside the scene, they were setting up the scenery. Outside the scene, they were still acting. The lights were also not carefully considered. In the boxes and front halls, peddlers selling sweets and fruits were walking back and forth, often obscuring the audience's view. Because many people wouldn't keep their mouths idle while watching the play, they always had to chew on sweet or salty things. Especially in the theater, the noise was a cacophony. It wasn't just the coughing of old men, but also the crying of children. The most annoying thing about that kind of new drama was that it was called "civilized drama." No one knows who decided on the word "civilized." And that group of actors also thought that they were reforming society and that it was a high-class profession. This so-called civilized drama and barbarian drama, no one could define it. At that time, they didn't need a large theatre. As long as it could seat four or five hundred people, it would be enough. They didn't care about the number of the audience, but about the decorum of the audience. There should be no clamor or noise. They would naturally sell tickets to recoup some expenses. But they were different from theater groups that were solely in the business. They had a kind of research nature. They were prepared for everyone to contribute a little money. However, that stage had to be new-fashioned. It didn't matter if it was smaller. All the scenery, the curtains, and the opening and closing of the curtains, had to be fully equipped. Later, they actually found a place. It was a foreign firm selling foreign musical instruments and pianos, called the Moutrie Piano Company. Inside the Moutrie Piano Company, there was a small theatre. Originally, their professions were all related to music. Musicians were related to playwrights. Many musicians living in Shanghai would borrow that place to hold concerts and dances. There was also a kind of opera, but not that kind of large-scale performance. The small theatre, with three or four hundred audience members, was also very good. As for the scenery on the stage, they had ordinary ones, but if they wanted something special, they had to make it themselves. They could also introduce you to scenery-making workers. Fortunately, borrowing his place to perform for a few days was also relatively cheap. Lu Junfu took me to that place and was very proud. Then he signed a contract with them. If the scenery was not enough, he would make one scene himself. Because the drama "Bu Rugui" only had five acts. One or two of them had the same scenery. The rest of the added scenery was also limited. Their performance was only focused on performance. Not focused on the scenery. When the preparations were completed, they selected the date and started the performance. Because Lu Junfu knew Zuo Shichen, he often came to his newspaper office to chat. It was as if he was treating him as an advisor. Discussing new school dramas was especially a pleasure for Lu Junfu.</p>

<h3>Financial Sunday Interbank Call Loan Rate Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Shanghai foreign currency interbank call loan rate was 7.2025%, both in the morning and afternoon sessions. The silver call loan rate for both sessions was 3%, with the results being roughly the same as the previous day. Exchange transactions were made: 450,000 in the morning session and 395,000 in the afternoon session for remittance drafts; 60,000 in the morning session and 25,000 in the afternoon session for banknotes; 5,000 in hard currency; and 20,000 in new currency.

<p>and 120,000 in new currency. The Guangdong community continued to load 250,000 in new currency. Hankou loaded 300,000 in hard currency. Bank transactions and remittance collections were suspended as usual due to Sunday. Qianzhuang (traditional Chinese banks) collected over 2.4 million in foreign public bills and over 23 million in silver public bills. Small qianzhuang traded 3-400,000 in banknote purchases and foreign exchange sales of new currency and hard currency.

<h3>Recent News on Long-Term Transactions</h3>
<p>The six sets of long-term, fixed-term loans issued or deposited around September of the lunar calendar last year, although the country has now adopted the Gregorian calendar, the date of the end of September at that time happened to coincide with the end of October in the Gregorian calendar. Therefore, the fixed term of these term loans differs by exactly one month between the Gregorian calendar and the lunar calendar. They should be fulfilled and delivered around April of this year. However, issuance, deposit, or renewal can still be handled as usual with the agreement of both parties. As such, upon investigation, the long-term loans with fixed terms deposited or issued on September 10th of last year should expire on the 10th of this month. The number of deposits has been verified to reach over 2 million, and the number of loans is no less than 3-4 million. However, because qianzhuang were affected by the Yu Da Zhuang stalemate last month, general depositors have become more cautious and selective. Therefore, there may be a large turnover in the current long-term settlement. For example, if a depositor used to deposit in Qianzhuang A, they may have to move it to Qianzhuang B. As for the loans issued by the qianzhuang at the end of last September, this time, due to market conditions, some who are short on silver must recover all of them for adjustment. If so, then of the long-term deposits expiring on the 10th, it is anticipated that there will be many settlements, and the number of rollovers will be no more than one-third. There is currently no certainty about the interest rate bids. Currently, the banks appear superficially loose, with the silver call loan rate being only a few points, so the deposit interest rate should naturally be inferior to the previous period. If the loan interest rate is owed, it is not surprising that it is slightly higher at five qian per tael due to the small number of issuers or for profit.</p>
<h3>Big Head Again Shrinks Zero Six Two Five</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a London dispatch reported that Big Head Silver has fallen again, shrinking 0.0625 recently, to 19 pence 375 (equivalent to 1 shilling and 10 pence in British gold).</p>

US-British, Japanese-British, and London-Shanghai shilling exchange rates remained unchanged, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yarn, Raw Silk, and American Cotton Rebound by Ten Points</h3>
<p>British Indian Cotton Weakens</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was mixed. There was an expected rebound, initially weakening due to long positions being closed, but later strengthening due to spot merchants buying in. Futures rose by 11 to 12 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 12 to 13 points, and spot prices fell by 10 points. Egyptian cotton fell by 15 points. Indian cotton initially weakened following American cotton, but then weakened further due to local short selling. The Pingle forward and backward months fell by 6 rupees, Omra forward and backward months fell by 7 rupees, and White Creek fell by 7 rupees; the forward month fell by 6 rupees.

<h3>The Progress of Japanese Cotton Mills in China in the Year 18</h3>
<p>During the first half of last year, Japanese-owned textile mills were slightly affected by the boycott movement. However, in the second half of the year, they returned to normal, and there were still reports of increasing spindles and machines. According to an investigation as of December last year, there were 39 Japanese-owned mills nationwide, one less than in the same period of the previous year, namely, the Donghua No. 1 Mill, which was sold to Chinese businessmen and renamed Longmao Cotton Mill. There were 1,454,160 yarn spindles, an increase of 56,886; 163,204 thread spindles, an increase of 45,660; and 11,281 looms, an increase of 481. The Shanghai No. 5 and Yufeng No. 2 factories, which are currently in the planning stage, are not included. The result of boycotting Japanese goods, but Japanese-owned textile mills have seen progress, which is quite thought-provoking. The numbers of yarn spindles, thread spindles, and looms in Japanese-owned textile mills in China at the end of the 18th year are listed below, along with a comparison of the numbers at the end of the 17th year.</p>

<h3>Yarn Prices Last Week Were Driven Up by Foreign Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market was quite weak at the beginning of the week, and the downward trend became more acute, because the bulls in March had no intention of taking delivery, so the sellers put more and more pressure. And thousands of bales of spot goods are in the hands of the shorts, so the market atmosphere at the beginning of the week was bad. The situation became tense again, and retail investors showed panic. Salesmen saw that the overall situation was not good, and they all stood still. Therefore, the lowest price for standard futures yarn this month was 147 taels and 8 qian, and for May, it was 148 taels and 3 qian. At that time, the market had to look at 45 taels. Unexpectedly, American cotton rose, and Toyo Sanpin yarn also rose, and the buyer's mood was slightly boosted. A certain manufacturer's buyer, on Tuesday this month, limited the price to 149 taels, and bought in large quantities, buying 2,300 bales in one day. At the same time, Yunnan merchants developed and bought more than 3,000 bales of 10-count yarn. People's hearts were agitated by it, and the market stabilized. On Wednesday and Thursday, a large household bought 5,600 bales in the near month, so the situation became even tougher. Recently, it has been seen at 151 taels and 8 qian. The yarn market was propped up by the buyers during the Spring Festival holidays on Friday and Saturday, and it will not fall sharply for the time being. However, the situation is urgent and unpredictable, and the future is difficult to consolidate. As a result, the price of each month of standard yarn rose by 2 taels compared with last week. The total transaction volume for the whole week was 69,650 bales. Among the customers, the Yunnan, Niuzhuang, and Guangdong merchants bought the most. The statistics of the amount bought by each merchant was 9,990 bales. Among the peers, 1,850 bales were bought. The amount bought by each merchant is recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>Last Week's Cotton Market Was Boosted by Foreign Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially had a flat situation due to sluggish sales, but the shortage of sources from various routes and the tough attitude of the Han merchants have made the market unusually firm. Later, as American and Indian cotton suddenly rose, the combined price was high, and the local shorts could not feel at ease. Activities were launched to buy back short positions, and the market atmosphere suddenly rose. A large household bought more than 10,000 dan of standard cotton to cover short positions in two days. As a result, the price of standard cotton rose by six or seven qian per month compared with the week. The total transaction volume for the whole week was 128,200 dan. The sources on the wharf were 3,820 bales of Tongzhou cotton and 1,260 bales of Yao cotton. Manufacturers bought 14,136 dan of forward and spot goods, and trading firms bought 3,580 dan. American cotton rose by 70 points compared with last week. The package amount bought by each manufacturer and trading firm is recorded below.</p>

<h3>Grain and River Downstream Japonica Rice Have Been Stagnant and Weak for Days</h3>
<p>Zhabei: In the past two days, the rice situation has been slightly different for each type of goods. A total of more than 50 shipments arrived, and sales were very sluggish, especially for northern japonica rice. However, the top-quality japonica rice in the market seems to be dwindling, so it can barely maintain the limit of 20 yuan. As for the ordinary Zhongguan rice, buyers are silent, and the price has been cut by one or two jiao. However, yesterday's market was determined by the seller's skills, because there were also those that did not fall. Observing the market situation, japonica rice is quite stagnant and weak, and the road for thin rice is very sluggish, so the market is depressed and gradually eroded. High-quality goods are only around 18 yuan and 7 jiao. There is a shortage of both river goods and old indica rice, and since the incoming goods are not prosperous, the producing market is still stable. Therefore, although the sales in this port are extremely numb, the price is still stable. Only the goods with secondary color have been slightly reduced. The kebu indica rice is completely crushed by foreign rice, so the zero discount is not very refreshing. Large dishes stand firm due to the rarity of arrivals, and the change of the yuan is negative. Both sales are even, and both are fresh and disgraceful.</p>
<p>Hunan: River downstream boats have been slightly connected since the weather cleared up. The import intention of each party varies. There is a discretion in the movement of japonica rice in Changxi Machine, but after the weakness of the north market, the price is extremely tight, so the market has unknowingly lost its spectrum.</p>
<p>There are few arrivals of white japonica rice from Suzhou and Tong. There are few tastes in rural villages, and the market price of high-quality goods is slightly repaired. The middle and secondary are soft. The sales of thin rice and early rice from the four townships of the South Merchants are sluggish, and the selection is strict and picky. The situation is therefore depressed, and the high and secondary are all downstream. The sheep indica rice is scarce in this area, and buyers are watching. The market price is flat. Duzi indica rice and passenger plane tips sell more actively. The store tastes are still active, and the market is still stable. The circulation of the general change is active. There are few arrivals, so the sellers sell them, and the price is tight. Check that there is not much change in the north and south markets in these two days. In addition, the Rice and Grain Price Evaluation Committee has recently been established, and the rice market will probably not be easy to rise in the future.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Sales Were Still Stagnant Last Week</h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Unpredictable...Chinese Merchants Sell at a Small Price</p>
<p>Demand in Europe and the United States Has Not Weakened...Current Silk Exports Are Still Smooth</p>
<p>Last week, the silk market in this port lacked the possibility of progress. It was found that European and American silk weavers were pre-weaving summer and autumn futures. The sales order for silk stockings has arrived, and the sales and consumption of raw silk are increasing, and the demand for current silk is in full swing. Due to the gold price relationship and the sufficient economic power of Japanese silk merchants, they are expanding the amount of silk in stock, and the degree of silk price decline is limited. At the beginning of the week, the transfer of Chinese silk was not weak. However, due to the unpredictable fluctuations in foreign exchange, European merchants did not dare to take risks and buy more. The bottom of dry cocoons was getting thinner day by day, and the price of cocoons was tending to be firm. The remaining goods of Chinese merchants were insufficient, and the source of Sichuan and Shandong provinces was not continued. The silk capital was becoming more and more expensive, and they all held on to the price increase before selling, so silk sales were difficult to progress. A total of only more than 500 packages of various types of silk were traded in the whole week, and the price was still firm. However, the current silk exports of various foreign warehouses were still smooth, with a total of more than 1,400 packages being loaded. The stock of silk in various foreign warehouses was only more than 700 packages. The price of Chinese silk in overseas markets was mixed. The market price of Chinese silk in the overseas market at the end of last week is listed below. (New York price per pound, unit gold yuan, Lyon price per kilo, unit francs)</p>

<h3>The International Anti-Narcotics Conference Passed a Resolution on International Cooperation in Anti-Narcotics</h3>
<p>Proposed by Mr. Wu Kaisheng, Representative of China</p>
<p>The 13th session of the International Anti-Narcotics Committee was held from January 20 to February 14 of this year in the Secretariat of the Japanese League of Nations in Geneva. Mr. Wu Kaisheng, the Chinese representative, delivered a speech at the meeting, expressing the determination of the Chinese National Government to strictly prohibit opium and other narcotic drugs, and the implementation of the ban throughout the country, which was deeply supported by the committee. Wu argued that the governments of all countries should sincerely cooperate with the Chinese government to jointly seek a ban. Fortunately, this was passed by the committee. The original draft submitted by Wu and the original text passed by the committee are recorded as follows: (1) Original draft submitted by our country: The Anti-Narcotics Advisory Committee is aware that China has suffered greatly from the smuggling of narcotic drugs, which is prohibited by the Hague Convention of 1912. Moreover, the Chinese government feels it is difficult to prohibit smuggling under the current situation. According to the provisions of Chapter 4 of the Hague Convention of 1912, the Chinese government and the governments of all countries that have treaty relations with China should take concerted action to prohibit the scourge of opium and narcotic drugs. Due to the development of smuggling in China and its recent phenomena, it is believed that close cooperation in this regard is particularly necessary at this time. Therefore, the Executive Yuan is requested to remind the governments of the countries concerned of the provisions of the aforementioned Hague Convention and to request the governments of each country to take appropriate measures to effectively implement the provisions. It was also decided to include the situation of narcotic drugs in China on the agenda of the next meeting. (2) Resolution passed by the Anti-Narcotics Committee of the League of Nations on February 11, 1919: The Anti-Narcotics Advisory Committee is aware that China has suffered greatly from the smuggling of narcotic drugs, which is prohibited by the Hague Convention of 1912. Moreover, the Chinese government feels it is difficult to prohibit smuggling under the current situation. According to the provisions of Chapter 4 of the Hague Convention of 1912, the Chinese government and the governments of all countries that have treaty relations with China should take concerted action to prohibit the scourge of opium and narcotic drugs. Due to the development of smuggling in China and its recent phenomena, it is believed that close cooperation in this regard is particularly necessary at this time. Therefore, the Executive Yuan is requested to inform the countries that have treaties with China of this matter, and it is recommended that the Chinese government and the countries that have treaties with China jointly study the current situation of narcotic drugs smuggled, and the countries that have treaties with China should find ways to implement the provisions of Chapter 4 of the Hague Convention, and the next Advisory Committee should consider this issue. It was also decided to include the situation of narcotic drugs in China on the agenda of the next meeting.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Merchants in Vietnam Telegraphically Request Prompt Resolution of French Onerous Taxes</h3>
<p>So That Hua Silk Can Be Shipped to the Market</p>
<p>The silk industry in this port, because the French government in Vietnam violated the treaty and increased the tax on Hua silk entering the country from 7% to 50%, resulting in the inability to transport and sell it. Although it had sent representatives to Beijing to petition and telegraphed repeatedly to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make serious representations to the French Minister to China, it has not been resolved for a year. The industry received a telegram from overseas Chinese merchants in Vietnam, such as Nianji, roughly stating that the spring season is now approaching, and there is a great need for domestic silk here. The existing stock has been exhausted. Japanese goods are light in material and cannot last long. It is hoped that the government will immediately negotiate with the French Minister and resolve the issue promptly so that the goods can be transported to Vietnam for sale. Otherwise, the silk industry, which has a long history, will be wiped out from now on, etc. After receiving the telegram, the industry heard that it intends to send representatives to Beijing again to make a final appeal and petition, so that it can be resolved immediately to facilitate commercial transportation.</p>
<h3>Meeting on How the Silk Industry Deals With Foreign Firms</h3>
<p>Reforming Various Old Habits</p>
<p>Electing Representatives for Negotiation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Cocoon Association and the Shanghai Silk Factory Association Organizing Committee, because according to reports from the industry, after the implementation of public measurement procedures for silk unloading by various foreign firms, various difficulties and nitpicking have occurred, specifically convened a temporary emergency meeting of all silk factory peers in Shanghai at 3:00 pm yesterday. More than 80 people attended. Huang Jinchen and Shen Huachen served as chairmen. After performing the rituals, the chairman first announced the purpose of the meeting, roughly stating that since the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau implemented the public measurement inspection of factory silk for export, various foreign firms, adhering to their habits and adopting sampling silk, still extracted one strip from each piece as before, and did not give receipts for shaking strips, and after the silk was loaded in canvas bags, the silk building still demanded oil paper white slips, etc., and did not fulfill the Shanghai business negotiation method. Now that various peers have sent letters requesting negotiation, it should be discussed. After mutual discussion by the peers, it was generally agreed that the silk buildings of various foreign firms did not follow the business negotiation methods to handle matters, and various elements were temporarily generated, which was really hateful. It was decided that only two strips should be allowed to be sampled for every five pieces of sample silk. Starting from April 1, the excess sample silk taken by each foreign firm should be returned in full. For the extracted shaking strips, the foreign firm should make a receipt for the people, indicating the number of strips and the weight, and still weigh and count when returning them. For silk loaded on Saturday, the silk payment will be paid on the morning of this day. After using canvas bags, the oil paper white slips that have always been used will be abolished immediately and will no longer be supplied. Chairman Shen said that the above decisions will be negotiated with the Export Silk Association based on reason, and it will be urged to earnestly fulfill them. At present, please be patient. From now on, do not be able to accommodate any unexpected demands from the silk building, so as not to make excuses. Next, it was discussed that Bao Tai Silk Factory and 12 other factories requested the Inspection Bureau to forward a letter, and the number of pounds and ounces on the public quantity list should be distributed and noted, and all foreign firms should be notified to eliminate the habit of rounding off, and to refer to the Japanese precedent of using four taels as a unit (ie, two out of ten and five), and not to arbitrarily deduct it, so as to initiate disputes and maintain interests. The case was passed. Finally, Chairman Shen reported that the public measurement inspection is related to laws and regulations, and the industry should jointly abide by it. If the buyer and seller have private contacts and settle the price by net weight, the inspection authorities have considerable punishment. All our peers should pay attention and not make mistakes. The meeting was adjourned and it was already half past five.</p>
<h3>Outbound Tea Tax Incident</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Instructs to Handle Separately</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tea Guild received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the proposal submitted by Anhui Province to levy an additional 10% education donation on outbound tea in boxes is inappropriate if it is true. It should be ordered to the financial commissioner of the province to quickly investigate and stop it in order to comply with the established case. As for the request to first exempt the 50% inland tax and not change it to a special tax levied on foreign tea in boxes, it should be carried out after the ministry has improved the method of overall planning. However, before the nationwide implementation of tax cuts, it should be handled according to the old rules for the time being to avoid changes. You should be informed. This is the approval.</p>
<h3>Why We Must Punish the Rebel Yan Xishan</h3>
<p>At this time of recent unification and before the people's suffering has subsided, how should all our comrades and compatriots throughout the nation unite as one to support the Central Government, consolidate the unification, enable the implementation of disbandment and reorganization, the progress of political tutelage, and the realization of construction? In the past year, disasters and turmoil have repeatedly arisen. The rebellious elements of Gui, Zhang, Feng, and Tang successively raised armies and betrayed the Party and the country, causing repeated disruptions to peaceful unification. Fortunately, relying on the loyalty and bravery of our Party's soldiers and all comrades, united as one, and the sincere support and assistance of the compatriots throughout the nation, we were finally able to quickly suppress the rebellious bandits who betrayed the Central Government, endangered the Party and the country, isolated themselves from the Party and the country, and isolated themselves from the masses. We were celebrating the thorough elimination of reactionary forces within the country, the permanent preservation of peaceful unification, and the opportunity for compatriots throughout the nation to live and work in peace, rest and recuperate. Unexpectedly, the rebel Yan Xishan, at a time when the border defense was strained and the remaining rebels had not yet been completely eliminated, again arbitrarily put forward propositions, coerced the Central Government, gathered the remnants of warlords, communist bandits, and all reactionary elements in Taiyuan, indiscriminately issued circular telegrams, instigated chaos to harm the country, moved troops, arrested party members, and closed down the Party and government organs of the Central Government in Peiping and Tientsin. The Central Government, with magnanimity, repeatedly tolerated this, and even though his rebellious intentions were already evident, it did not hastily issue an order for his punishment, hoping that he could still awaken and repent, to avoid further war and preserve the vitality of the country. However, the beastly nature of the rebel Yan could never be changed, and his warlord ambition could never be restrained. Recently, he has intensified his efforts, acting perversely, outwardly claiming to go abroad, but secretly preparing for war, letting Feng return to Shaanxi, and actually mobilizing troops. This is the action of someone who has lost his mind and is plotting rebellion, willing to bear the crime of undermining peaceful unification, and willing to be a successor to Gui, Feng, Zhang, and Tang. In order to maintain the discipline of the Party and the country and consolidate unification and peace, the Central Government has truly reached the point of being unable to tolerate it any longer and unable to forgive it any longer. It has no choice but to issue a clear order for his punishment and to eliminate the treacherous and villainous elements. During this period of suppressing the rebellion, we must deeply understand and actively promote the crimes of the rebel Yan in betraying the Party and harming the country, as well as the significance of the punishment. I will now enumerate them on the left as a declaration to the people of the country.</p>
<p>(1) The Crimes of Yan Xishan in Betraying the Party and Harming the Country</p>
<p>1.  Seizing Power and Position in the Name of Revolution: Before the Xinhai Revolution, when Yan Xishan was studying in Japan, he once joined the Tongmenghui, but after returning to China, he served as the standard commander of the First Standard of the Shanxi New Army, willingly serving as a servant of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, and no longer had the revolutionary cause in his heart. On September 8th of the Xinhai Revolution, the Jin Army launched an uprising. Yao Yijia, the battalion commander of the Second Standard of the New Army, led all the officers and soldiers to break through the provincial capital, and then used one company to attack the Manchu city, one company to attack the governor's yamen, and one company was personally led by Yao, providing support in the middle. After a day of hard fighting, the governor of Shanxi was killed. At the same time, the Manchu city was also captured, but Yao's subordinates also suffered heavy losses, with only a few dozen people remaining. Before that, Huang Guoliang, the standard commander of the Second Standard, had already been ordered to leave the provincial capital. Yan Xishan, possessing all the soldiers of the standard, remained stationed and did not move, with the intention of waiting for an opportunity to harm the revolutionary army and seek credit from the Qing Dynasty. When he heard that the Manchu city had been captured and the governor had been killed, he urgently ordered his subordinates to occupy the gunpowder bureau, armory, and other places, and then declared that he was a member of the Tongmenghui and was willing to cooperate with Yao. He then took the opportunity to send private cronies to carry out activities everywhere, inviting the officers who initiated the uprising to a meeting at the former Provincial Assembly. Because he possessed the power to mobilize troops, he was publicly elected as the temporary commander-in-chief, occupying the territory of Shanxi and becoming its local emperor for more than ten years.</p>
<p>2.  Slaughtering Comrades and Encouraging Yuan to Become Emperor: After Yan Xishan seized the territory of Shanxi in the name of the Tongmenghui, he immediately bribed and colluded with the Beiyang warlords. When Yuan Shikai obtained the title of Grand President by deceit, Yan the rebel flattered him in every possible way, and was extremely attentive. In order to consolidate his position, he first declared his withdrawal from the Party and devoted himself to slaughtering revolutionary comrades and disbanding revolutionary organizations. The arrest of comrades Zhang Shixiu and Li Wufeng, and the massacre of revolutionary comrades in the Hedong Incident, almost wiped out the revolutionary forces in the north led by the Premier of our Party. He also often advocated the absurd idea that the military state and the empire were complementary, and that the empire must be rebuilt before a military state could be created, in order to promote Yuan Shikai's autocratic ideas and encourage his ambition to become emperor. When the Preparatory Committee was established, in addition to contributing two million yuan himself, he also persuaded a Shanxi ticket dealer to donate three million yuan. Fearing that the rebel Yuan would not completely trust him, he also sent his parents to Beijing as hostages, and then sent personnel to persuade Yuan to advance, and was the first to become Yuan’s subject. Yuan Shikai then announced the imperial system. The Republic of China, which the revolutionary martyrs had exchanged for with their heads and blood, was almost interrupted because of Yuan's declaration of the imperial system. Tracing back to the culprit, it was all caused by the rebel Yan Xishan's conspiracy and instigation.</p>
<p>3.  Exploiting People's Wealth in the Name of Village Governance: Yan the rebel is inherently greedy and cunning, and has employed countless schemes. For more than ten years of governing Shanxi, he has promoted village governance. The people of the country value what they hear and despise what they see, and through misrepresentation, they have given him the reputation of being a model governor. In fact, the village governance he has implemented is purely a paper exercise. According to recent reports from social organizations in various places, his so-called village governance is simply using village chiefs who are over forty or fifty years old and addicted to opium to extort money from the local people. In short, he uses the village chiefs as his personal tools for accumulating and extorting wealth. Two years ago, Yan the rebel sent his nephew with a portion of the wealth he had accumulated over the years, totaling twenty million yuan, to be deposited in a French bank. Later, because his nephew indulged in extravagance in France, he died of excessive indulgence. The French bank then confiscated his deposit (on the grounds that the deposit was in the name of the nephew and not in the name of Yan, and now that the nephew is dead, it should be taken over as public property of France). Yan the rebel was extremely distressed. Last autumn, when Feng the rebel mutinied, the reason why he claimed to accompany Feng abroad was to personally negotiate with France for the return of this large amount of unjustly taken deposit. Now that there is no hope of recovering this matter, he is again plotting evil and engaging in endless extortion. In the past year, Yan the rebel has occupied the territories of the four provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan, and his income has been even greater. He regards Hebei as a colony and orders it to pay two million yuan in cash every month. He still thinks this is not enough and issues banknotes indiscriminately in Shanxi in order to absorb the cash of the four provinces. His greed, cruelty, cunning, and poisonousness are unprecedented.</p>
<p>4.  Destroying Education and Practicing Ignorance: The education in Shanxi can be summed up in one sentence: "Education for the policy of keeping the people ignorant." The purpose of its education, ostensibly military-nationalist democracy, is actually to make the people of Shanxi slaves and docile citizens of Yan the rebel. This is exactly the same as Feng Yuxiang's training of soldiers, making them only know Commander-in-Chief Feng. Yan the rebel also established a talent cultivation center in Taiyuan. All students graduating from any school at home and abroad must enter the center for two years. He must tame them and train them to be running dogs before giving them the opportunity to work. Otherwise, he will either drive them out of the country or find ways to make them addicted to opium in order to destroy their ambition and ability. He even induces students in elementary, middle, and high schools to smoke opium, making it a fashion. The purpose of this is not to simply keep the people ignorant, but to destroy the people, so that the people of Shanxi will be deeply poisoned, lose all their vitality, have no revolutionary ideas, and have no revolutionary ability, so that he can maintain his position forever and be the local emperor of Shanxi for a long time.</p>
<p>5.  Disrupting Transportation and Disturbing Finance: Since Yan Xishan opportunistically joined our Party in the autumn of the seventeenth year of the Republic, his various crimes are too numerous to record. For the past two years, he has been extracting subsidies and detaining vehicles on the Peiping-Hankow and Peiping-Suiyuan Railways almost every day, causing the finances of the two railways to be on the verge of bankruptcy. According to the current reports, the amount of subsidies taken from the Peiping-Hankow and Peiping-Suiyuan Railways totals more than 5.5 million yuan. The amount taken from the Peiping-Suiyuan and Zhengtai Railways from December of the seventeenth year of the Republic to July and August of last year is also no less than 400,000 yuan, and the unreported amounts are not included. As for the vehicles he has detained along the Peiping-Hankow Railway in recent years, the number has reached hundreds, and they have never been returned to the railway bureau, causing the traffic on the Peiping-Hankow Railway to decline day by day and become unmanageable. In short, Yan the rebel occupies the north, forcibly occupies the Peiping-Hankow and Peiping-Suiyuan Railways, regards them as private property, disregards the country, and flouts the law. He also connives at the military, selling car skins at will and forcing down the price of Shanxi coal transportation to fill his own pockets, causing the business of the Peiping-Hankow and Peiping-Suiyuan Railways to plummet. In the past, the annual revenue of the Peiping-Hankow Railway was at least more than 30 million yuan, but last year the total revenue was only about 10 million yuan. The revenue of the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway was also more than 9 million yuan in the past, but last year it was less than 5 million yuan. Recently, Yan the rebel also detained the through train on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and various passenger trains to transport troops, and monitored telegrams and hijacked railway affairs. The tracks and iron bridges south of Dezhou were also bombed. His crimes of disrupting transportation are even worse than those of Feng and Tang. Since the founding of the Republic of China, warlords have been dividing and occupying territory, and there have been years of war. The only place that has been able to maintain peace and avoid war is Shanxi. According to the usual assumption, the economic situation and the people's livelihood in Shanxi must be better than in other provinces. However, the facts show us exactly the opposite. The Shanxi Provincial Bank is issuing irredeemable banknotes in such large quantities that probably no one except the Shanxi Provincial Finance Authorities knows the exact number. In order to reorganize the banknotes of the Shanxi Provincial Bank, the Central Government previously approved the issuance of 24 million yuan of Shanxi financial public bonds for financial reorganization to provide relief. However, recently Yan the rebel has again adopted the method of concentrating cash and indiscriminately issuing large amounts of banknotes, prohibiting the export of cash, making the financial situation even more chaotic and the people more and more miserable. Fortunately, the Central Government has now decided to cancel this debt, and it has not been put into circulation. Otherwise, the people of Shanxi would have suffered even greater losses.</p>
<p>6.  Inciting Feng and Tang to Disrupt Unification: Yan the rebel is inherently fond of chaos. The successive rebellions of Feng Yuxiang and Tang Shengzhi in the past year were all caused by his conspiracy and instigation. Last autumn, on August 14th of the lunar calendar, when Feng was in Jinci, Yan sent a telegram to Feng, saying that tomorrow was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and invited him to enjoy the moon together. The next day, Yan hosted Feng at a banquet in Jinci, where he incited Feng to betray him in every possible way. Feng was initially quite unenthusiastic, but after Yan repeatedly urged him, he was finally moved. They immediately agreed that Feng would be responsible for military affairs and Yan would be responsible for political affairs, and they planned everything. When the troops of Song Zheyuan, Sun Liang, and others under Feng failed to raise troops, and the Central Army forced their way to Tongguan, Yan knew that nothing could be done, so he issued a circular telegram expressing his absolute support for the Central Government and declaring that he would punish Feng, but he did not send a single soldier. Later, when the troops of Shi Yousan mutinied in Pukou, Yan again came up with a strange idea and sent Zhao Pi-lian to persuade Tang Shengzhi to issue a telegram to resist the Central Government. Tang Shengzhi sent a representative, Yuan, to discuss with him, and it was decided that Yan would be responsible for the Party and government, and Tang would command the remnants of the Northwest Army. Yan then sent a telegram to Feng, saying that Tang Shengzhi had now awakened, but wanted your troops to be under his command. Feng agreed, and then recognized and gave Tang 500,000 yuan for mobilization expenses. After consulting back and forth, the matter was delayed, and Tang rebelled against the Central Government with his electrical telegram. However, there were slight discrepancies with what Yan had advocated, and he only received 250,000 yuan for mobilization expenses. Later, when Yan saw the Central Army besieging from all sides and that Tang could not support it, he again sent a telegram supporting the Central Government and turned to declare that he would punish Tang, sitting back and reaping the benefits. In the past year, he has made others clamor and rush forward, while he has issued instructions from behind. If they succeed, he will reap the benefits; if they fail, they will suffer the consequences. His cunning and treachery are truly unparalleled.</p>
<p>7.  Arbitrarily Making Propositions and Taking the Opportunity to Instigate Chaos: Yan the rebel's joining of our Party and engaging in the National Revolution has become increasingly opportunistic. His feudal ideas have not changed at all. Recently, he has been plotting reaction and repeatedly making absurd remarks. First, he advocated giving way to the country and being responsible in retirement. Then, he changed from being responsible in retirement to organizing a council of elders and a privy council consisting of the commanders-in-chief of the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Group Armies. Finally, he advocated that the executive and supervisory committee members of the First, Second, and Third National Congresses should be jointly responsible, and that all party members should vote to resolve party issues. To give way to the country is to regard the country as the private property of one or two people, which can be privately transferred at will. This is completely the mindset of a family dynasty. As for being responsible in retirement, it is even more contradictory, because being in retirement and being responsible are absolutely incompatible. Examining the motivation behind his remarks, it is nothing more than using the good name of the Party and the country to coerce Chiang Kai-shek, a comrade who is loyal to the masses and upholds Party rule, to retire and abandon the responsibility of the revolution, and then to reinstate Pu Yi, Duan Qirui, Wu Peifu, Zhang Zongchang, and others who have been selling the country and harming the people for decades to come to power, first destroying our Party and then destroying China. As for advocating that the commanders-in-chief of the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Group Armies and others should organize a council of elders and a privy council to oversee everything, it is directly advocating that military autocracy should replace democratic centralism, and it has already exposed its true colors as a warlord, which is tantamount to a confession of betraying the masses. Combining the executive and supervisory committees of the First, Second, and Third Central Committees in one place not only violates the Party Constitution, but also intends to gather reactionary elements who have been lawfully expelled from the Party by the Central Committee, such as Mao Zedong, Tan Pingshan, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Feng Yuxiang, and Chen Gongbo, to the Central Committee, so that the Third International Communist Party reorganization faction and feudal warlords can once again bring disaster to the Party and the country. As for the general vote of party members, what Party Constitution does it follow? What precedents does it cite? It is absurd and ridiculous, and enough to make people laugh. The rebel is making such preposterous remarks, directly unaware of the Party, and even more unaware of the country. His intention is nothing more than to take this opportunity to instigate chaos.</p>
<p>8.  Colluding with Reactionaries and Threatening the Party and the Country: In the past month, the road to Taiyuan has been filled with carriages and horses. Guo Chuntao and Wang Faqin, representatives of the reorganization faction, Pan Yizhi, representative of the Gui clique, Bian Shoujing, representative of Qi Xieyuan, Zou Lu, representative of the Western Hills Conference faction, Wu Guangxin, representative of the Anfu clique, and representatives of bandits, and representatives sent by Japanese imperialists, have all gathered in Taiyuan, spreading rumors and creating illusions. Yan the rebel treats these representatives with great respect, housing them in separate residences and treating them as honored guests. They hold joint meetings in the Zisheng Hall every day to discuss methods of betraying the Central Government and endangering the Party and the country, bringing together the great achievements of imperialist warlords, bandits, and all corrupt and greedy elements. If they were to succeed by chance, not only would the current situation of peaceful unification be completely destroyed, but the state of disintegration and separation of the past ten years would be restored, and disasters would invade and engulf the country and the nation in an abyss of no return.</p>
<p>9.  Closing Down Party Headquarters and Arresting Party Members: After Yan the rebel issued a telegram, although the party headquarters in Peiping and Tianjin were under feudal forces, they were still able to work hard in the spirit of the Premier's great fearlessness, refuting the non-unification in his telegram, and printing and distributing various publications clarifying that peace cannot be discussed without unification, and construction cannot be discussed without peace, and posting various bulletins and slogans to correct the people's vision. Yan the rebel then secretly ordered the troops in Peiping and Tianjin to close down the party headquarters in the two special municipalities of Peiping and Tianjin and Hebei Province, and forcibly ordered them to stop working, and arrested Lu Dangping, the Minister of Propaganda of the Tianjin Special Municipality Party Department, and Jia Yi, the Reorganization Committee Member of Hebei Province. He also sent troops to occupy the North China Daily, the propaganda organ of the Central Committee in Peiping and Tianjin, and the Central News Agency branch, and arrested its director, Yin Shuxian. This kind of vicious and cruel means of destroying Party affairs and undermining the revolution, which the rebels Feng and Tang had previously been afraid to do, Yan the rebel brazenly did it without regard for the consequences, and his crimes were actually greater than those of Feng and Tang.</p>
<p>10. Publicly Claiming to Go Abroad, but Secretly Planning to Invade Southwards: After Yan Xishan issued absurd remarks, the people of the whole country attacked him. The Central Government, with magnanimity, sought only peace and did not pursue the past. It listened to his voluntary resignation and gave him preferential treatment. However, Yan the rebel harbored evil intentions and did not repent until his death. On the one hand, he declared to the Central Government that he would retire and go abroad, but on the other hand, he was still holding military meetings in Taiyuan, inciting his subordinates to send telegrams to retain him. On the one hand, he encouraged Feng Yuqin to return to Tongguan and send troops to invade the east. At the same time, he was also conscripting new recruits in Hebei, preparing to invade southwards. Yan the rebel believes that this move will preemptively attack, but he does not know that the more obvious the crime of betraying the Party and harming the country is, the faster his elimination and demise will be. This is evidenced by the facts of the past, which are unmistakably true.</p>
<p>11. Colluding with Foreigners, Selling the Country and Seeking Help: Since the founding of the Republic of China, the Beiyang warlords have been fighting and killing each other, repeatedly retaliating for more than ten times. Yan the rebel has been in between, colluding with both sides, and has never made a clear expression. Although this is due to his inherently treacherous nature, his mediocrity and cowardice are also a factor. In the war against Feng in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the people of the country believed that it was against the norm. In fact, Yan the rebel dared to launch the attack purely because he was instigated and secretly assisted by Japanese imperialism. Because Tu Ni was a direct descendant of the pro-Japanese Duan system, Duan was expelled by the Feng faction, so he lobbied Japan to instigate Yan the rebel to oppose Feng. This rebellion is the same. Yan the rebel intends to betray the Central Government and wants to get the help of Japan. Japan wants to actively invade North China, so it uses Yan the rebel as a puppet, and Lu Zongyu and others are in the middle to bring them together, so they conclude a kind of treaty of betrayal. The content of the treaty is that Japan will provide Yan the rebel with as much financial and military equipment as possible to resist the Central Government and establish a government in Peiping, and Yan the rebel will promise to give Japan the mining rights of the most profitable mines in Shanxi and the construction rights of the Inner Mongolia Railway as a reward. This treaty was established two months ago. In addition to successively transporting various military equipment to Shanxi, Japan has also secretly dispatched personnel from the General Staff Headquarters to be stationed in Taiyuan, Tianjin, and Peiping to plan military affairs for Yan the rebel. The strategy of Yan the rebel's three-way southward invasion was adopted according to the suggestions of the Japanese staff. Yan the rebel knew that the southward invasion might not succeed, so he prepared for a long-term plan, and also borrowed 20 million yuan from American, French, and Belgian companies, half in cash and half priced in flour. A part of it has been transported from Tianjin to Shanxi. The 2 million yuan and 300,000 bags of flour that Yan the rebel allocated to Feng the rebel were part of this loan. In short, in order to betray the Central Government and satisfy his ambition, Yan the rebel does not hesitate to sacrifice the people of North China and does not hesitate to sacrifice national sovereignty as the price. His crime of selling the country and seeking help is even worse than Feng the rebel's collusion with Soviet Russia and the loss of Mongolia and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>(2) Our Understanding and Efforts in Punishing Yan Xishan</p>
<p>1.  Yan the rebel is essentially a remnant of the Beiyang warlords who is fickle, unprincipled, and shameless. The reason why our Party gave him preferential treatment when he returned two years ago was to give him the opportunity to improve himself and to influence him with the personality of the Premier and the sincerity of comrades, hoping that he would change his ways from now on and be on the right track, and make some contributions to redeem his past sins. However, Yan the rebel's beastly nature cannot be changed after all. Since he joined our Party, he has appeared loyal and honest, but in reality he is unpredictable. In the past two years, he has been a monster and a ghost, and his treachery is unparalleled. He has used the people who are trusted by the Central Committee to engage in sabotage and rebellion, and has destroyed the revolution in the name of revolution, colluding with imperialists and corrupt forces, betraying the Party and the country, destroying peaceful unification, willingly being the leader of the Rong, and being vicious and poisonous. He has not repented until his death. He has isolated himself from the Party and isolated himself from the country. Therefore, we must quickly issue a clear order and carry out a large-scale attack to rectify the discipline of the country and maintain the righteousness of the world.</p>
<p>2.  At present, the most urgent demands of the people are national peace and unification, and the necessary conditions for carrying out political tutelage and construction and completing the national revolution are also national peace and unification. Only with peaceful unification can we restore the vitality of society, and only with unification can we establish national power. Peaceful unification is the fundamental policy formulated by the Central Committee based on the actual needs of the people. Those who vigorously implement this policy are friends of the people, and those who violate this policy are enemies of the people. The reason is very clear. The recent outrageous remarks made by Yan the rebel, and his vicious and treacherous actions in the past year, are all aimed at destroying peace and unification. In this era of Party rule, those who violate the discipline of our Party, flout national laws and regulations, and plot to destroy peace and unification are creating chaos. Conversely, those who obey the orders of the Central Committee, abide by national laws, eliminate traitors and bandits who endanger the Party and the country, and maintain national peace and unification are suppressing chaos. The Central Committee, in accordance with the teachings of the Premier, is engaged in revolutionary construction, and it cannot but launch a vigorous punitive expedition against this chaotic feudal warlord, eliminate the fierce and stubborn elements, consolidate the unification of the country, and ensure the victory of the revolution, so that political tutelage can be promoted and construction can be implemented, and to establish a new model of China together with our compatriots throughout the country.</p>
<p>3.  Our Party is a revolutionary political party that is trusted and supported by the people of the whole country. As shown by the past facts, those who obey the Central Committee survive, and those who betray the Central Committee perish. Previously, the rebels of the Gui clique and Feng and Tang had territories that were not wide and troops that were not numerous. However, once they betrayed the Central Committee, they were abandoned by the people of the whole country and swept away by the revolutionary armed forces. Within a month, they were completely eliminated. The end of Yan the rebel will be no exception. However, Yan the rebel has been entrenched in Shanxi for a long time and has deep roots. Recently, he has recruited corrupt elements and blusters. Although his strength is not enough to shake the Central Committee and endanger the Party and the country, his rampage and stubborn struggle are enough to prolong the war and increase the suffering of the people of the country. We, the people of the whole country, should recognize that this punishment of Yan the rebel is the fundamental elimination of the remnants of the Beiyang warlords by our Party, and the final decisive battle between the revolution and the counter-revolution. Once this remaining Beiyang warlord Yan is eliminated and the united corrupt forces are crushed at the same time, the roots of reaction will be forever eradicated, the unification of the country will be ensured, construction will be carried out smoothly, and political tutelage will be realized as scheduled. The people of the four provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan have long been under the violence of Yan the rebel and have suffered from the exploitation and destruction of the enemy. In order to eliminate suffering and reduce the war, they should unite as one, launch a joint effort, and assist the Central Committee in eliminating this disaster, the rebellious Party, and the traitorous and harmful bandit.</p>

<h3>How to Commemorate "April 12th"?</h3>
<p>Eliminate the remnants of the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p>Overthrow the Northern Warlord Yan Xishan</p>
<p>Abolish all unequal treaties Support Chairman Chiang, who has contributed greatly to the hard work</p>
<p>(1) The April 12th Party Purification Commemoration is the anniversary of our party's elimination of Communist Party members who had joined our party. It is a crucial turning point for our party, a matter of great importance to the people's welfare, the foundation of the nation, and the safety of the nation. We should use this opportunity to conduct large-scale propaganda for purging the party and opposing communism in order to eradicate the roots of the Communist Party and consolidate the foundation of our party.</p>
<p>(2) The purpose of the propaganda for purging the party and opposing communism can be explained from two aspects: purging the party and opposing communism. The so-called propaganda for purging the party is to make the public understand the intentions, process, and relationships of our party's purging of party members who had joined our party. Make the public understand that if the party members who had joined our party are not eliminated, then the party will not be the party, and the country will not be the country. The so-called anti-communist propaganda is to make the public understand the crimes of the Communist Party, not only should they not be allowed to live in our party, but they should also be prevented from acting and their followers should be wiped out.</p>
<p>(3) Our party's tolerance of the Communist Party in the thirteenth year was to tolerate individual Communist Party members in the hope that they would be loyal to the Three Principles of the People, not to tolerate the entire Communist Party in order to divide the Kuomintang. Unexpectedly, after the Communist Party members who hung a sheep's head to sell dog meat joined the Kuomintang, they acted in the name of the Kuomintang and practiced the Communist Party's reality, distorting the Three Principles of the People, confusing young people, and forcing workers to be their sacrificial tools. They used all kinds of methods to try to steal party power and seize power in order to achieve their goal of "China returning to Russia."</p>
<p>(4) At the critical moment of the Northern Expedition in the sixteenth year, the Communist Party used methods of profit inducement and coercion to instigate workers and friends to strike without cause, causing disturbances in various places to disrupt the rear of the Northern Expedition. On the one hand, they used the means of instigation and alienation to isolate the united front of our party and the revolutionary people from all walks of life, so as to eliminate their sympathy for the party. It can be said that they have exhausted the ability of sinister destruction, and their only attempt is to destroy the National Revolution in order to subvert our party and destroy China. Fortunately, the advanced comrades of our party extracted their conspiracy and resolutely decided to carry out the purification of the party on April 12 of the sixteenth year and eliminate all the party members who had joined our party. Therefore, the party purification movement is our party's primary task of saving the party, and it is also the only way to save the country, because our party is purging the party in order to eliminate the obstacles to "China's independence," to complete the mission of our party in order to "consolidate the foundation of our party," and to protect the interests of the people to purge the party.</p>
<p>(5) The work of purifying the party is certainly important, but purifying the party is only one of the methods of anti-communism, not the only method of anti-communism. If the party is only purified without continuing to oppose communism, then the remaining forces of communism will not be easily eliminated, and it is difficult to guarantee that they will not revive. Therefore, after purifying the party, we must continue to oppose communism and fundamentally eliminate the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>(6) Passive anti-communist work is certainly necessary, but the construction work on the positive side is also very important. The people should support our party's training of the people to the point, and assist the government in engaging in construction, implementing local autonomy, and completing the work of training the government. This can be said to be positive anti-communist work.</p>
<p>(7) Finally, we must have a deep understanding that our party has resolutely eliminated the Communist Party in the past period, then the reactionary elements in the future, such as the reorganization faction, the West Mountain Conference faction, all expelled party ruffians, and unscrupulous politicians, and the Northern Warlords with feudal ideas, who do not understand China's environment, and are confused about the general trend of the world, slander the central government, and deliberately sabotage, often suffer from the Communist Party's utilization without knowing it themselves. As far away as Feng Tang, Zhang Li's arbitrary declaration of soldiers, and as close as Yan Xishan's betrayal of the party and the country, they are not tolerated by our party, and they are especially included in the ranks of absolute elimination and eradication. Therefore, before the anti-revolutionary elements have not been eliminated for a day, the National Revolution led by our party cannot succeed for a day. Comrades of our party should be diligent and courageous, and make extra efforts to realize the doctrines of the whole party as soon as possible and make the revolution a success as soon as possible. This is really the point that we should pay attention to and work hard for in the future.</p>
