<p>前日華盛頓電謂全國共和黨主席賀司頓去職胡佛總統一派擬推費斯繼任昨倫敦電謂工黨將更換黨魁以漢德森代表麥克唐納爾之運動已漸得勢此兩政黨爲英美兩國執政之大政黨其領袖之得人與否非僅關於一黨之盛衰且於政局安危與總選舉前途均有極大影響</p>
<p>美國共和黨之政策近漸失一般民衆之信任其最大原因即爲胡佛總統就任時曾宣言擁護農民利益故得農民熱烈之贊助今新稅則發表殊違其初定之方針且所預定之救濟農民方法亦未辦到因之頓失農民之同情據報載費與西中部農民派有相當聯絡故欲利用以挽回農民之情感亦即藉以鞏固共和黨勢力爲將來總選舉競爭之張本也</p>
<p>至英國之工黨近來團結亦不如從前之堅而他黨又時加以掣肘自由黨果能與工黨妥協則政局尙易處理然觀前次衆院表决修改財政法案時政府雖幸賴自由黨四票之反對得免於失敗然其他十餘議員均未參加投票則可以證明自由黨多數尙不願與工黨合作而保守黨近更時提反對工黨之議案攻擊政府麥唐納處此無法維繫之情勢下而各種難問題又續續而來去歲工黨用以攻繫保守黨内閣之失業問題不意至今日而情勢愈見嚴重反爲保守黨所藉口事實上旣有種種困難則更換首領或能轉換一時之空氣而於將來之總選舉更可開一發展之新局面亦未可知前曾一度傳麥唐納辭工黨首領說而未即實現者殆以未得相黨繼任之人歟</p>

<p>華界安靜如常</p>
<p>昨日本巿防範極嚴南巿閘北前晚十二時起即宣佈戒嚴斷絶交通英法兩租界警務處亦防範甚嚴因之昨日除公共租界南京路及北四川路一帶稍有紛擾外並無重大事故發生</p>
<p>公共租界昨晨九時半左右南京路西藏路一帶有形似工人學生者男女多人續漸齊集一聲呼喊傳單紛飛且雜以爆竹聲一時甚爲紛亂該管老閘捕房早有戒備中西武裝巡捕立即上前拘捕旋將羣衆驅散餘衆乃向東由勞合路浙江路一帶逃逸兩旁店舖暫時閉門以防不測巡捕在後追趕當時拘獲八人送上預停於路上之警備車中群羣衆見機不佳乃三五成羣分别走避至山西路南京路口當有三人被中央捕房巡捕拘去河南路南京路口亦停有警備車一輛並有武裝巡捕多人守視羣衆見有戒備紛紛向四川路及外灘方面而去惟中有較爲激烈者行經南京路河南路口仍向店舖玻窗抛擲磚石經守視之中西探捕上前驅散若輩未得大逞然已有一二處受有損失矣若輩乃折入四川路及向東往外灘而去經過白渡橋北蘇州路而往虹口一帶其手中所持之傳單已經不多沿途祇略呼口號而已虹口區中前後被捕拘去七人中有四人因無關係即行釋放北四川路海寗路附近早上亦有形似工人者發現惟爲數尙少祇向電車内抛擲傳單而已嚮午十一時左右途中所發現者大都由南京路及外灘等處而來然已無所舉動矣</p>
<p>法租界昨日上午三時許及上午九時左右馬浪路陶爾斐斯路及勞神父路等處有人秘密散發傳單迨探捕趕到若輩已遠颺無踪大世界游戲塲每日下午十二時後開始營業昨日延至二時三十五分方始售票至五時半因該處行人衆多隨經捕房通知暫停營業直至夜晚八時十分始恢復原狀</p>
<p>華界南巿閘北徐家匯龍華曹家渡一帶無形戒備甚嚴呼要隘均由公安局派站雙崗荷槍實彈甚爲週密行人車輛稍有可疑者均施檢查閘北新閘橋恒豐路橋等處並有兵士守護形勢嚴重晚十二時起仍照前晚辦法一體戒嚴斷絶車輛行人通過</p>

<p>雙方談判尙無結果</p>
<p>上海郵務工會職工會前將歷年懸案歸併十條要求向郵政當局提出並限期五日内答覆等情已誌前報兹悉該兩工會以期限已過而當局尙無答覆遂於前昨兩日派工會代表朱學範張克昌及職工會代表傳德衛陳靈舟康雍史濟寛等七人赴郵政總辦處開談話會並探聽當局有無圓滿答覆之誠意總辦韋以黻以交通部務繁忙未能來滬遂由總辦處秘書楊思禮與工會代表接洽經過二次談話楊秘書當將當局意見向代表陳說工會所提十項舉求如（一）郵政華員短長假病假之增訂及婚喪假例假之新規定（三）取銷差童證書並澈底改良其待遇（六）恢復人員史動半月刋（七）更正總局通令第二零八號關於郵政總辦秘書享受郵政人員之同等待遇事（八）規定因公受傷及年老之信差爲局内信差（九）明文規定服務滿十五年以上之信差或聽差經簡便考試升爲郵務佐等七項當局方面表示可以接受或修正接受至（二）金貴銀賤津貼（每月增加八分之一）及（十）年終奬勵金之改良（工作一年以上者得一個半月奬勵）兩項當局方面以全國郵務人員薪金總數一千七百萬元若每月增八分之一即須二百餘萬元年終奬勵金以一個半月作標準則須四十萬元表示不能接受而工會方面亦不讓步雙方態度堅决前昨兩日之談話並無結果此外（四）經濟公開一項當局方面表示可以公開惟工會方面以其所謂公開表示不能滿意因工會方面對郵政匯業儲金局與郵局分立實際上將郵局現金吸收有碍郵局前途故所謂郵政經濟公開云云其眞意即須將匯業儲金歸併入郵局此項亦爲雙方爭執之焦點昨日午後雙方談話無結果而散後</p>
<p>一闢斥北平僞中央擴大會議一法理毫無根據追次閻馮二逆授意西山改組兩派所閙的籌安會式的擴大會議法理的根據完全没有所謂中央擴大會議究竟是以那一次的中央爲中央一屆二屆的中央委員在南京的多還是在北平的多是否祗有這幾個資格消失變節的叛徒配講話這種軍閥餘孽共産黨徒及改組西山派的鴉片烟鬼投機變節份子胡閙實表示了反革命的大集團而已在黨章上無所根據在事實上又這様毁黨亂國中央兩字根本不能成立有什麽所謂擴大呢</p>
<p>二開會情形滑稽這次把戲閙得可發一笑號稱三十多人而出席者祗十一人一人而代三個人簽字試問有何價值第一次的集會就形成了這様一個騙騙自已的局面以後的一幕一幕其奇特滑稽更堪發噱這幕滑稽戲的情形可想而知了</p>
<p>三不啻迴光返照在實際上閻馮到了目前已經是圖窮而七見無論財政軍事政治各方面均已陷於絶境所以借什麽擴大會議的名目來掩飾自已窮極無辦法的眞相罷了在他們心目中簡直並没有黨所以千方設法破壞總理數十年艱難締造的本黨這種罪惡實足以毁黨亂國同時却反映出他們已經快到滅亡的境地祗是一幕迴光返照的慘劇而已一四同胞應起闢斥北平僞中央擴大會議的荒謬與滑稽已如上述我們爲了民族的利益起見對於這些毁黨亂國的叛賊閻錫山馮玉祥汪精衛鄒魯等當然不能姑容我們應當一方面請求中央在最短期間克復平津滅其巢穴同時更應共同起來對這個荒謬與滑稽的北平僞中央擴大會議加以闢斥</p>
<p>五口號標語（一）北平擴大會議是籌安會的變相（二）北平擴大會議是替閻馮捧塲的集團（三）北平擴大會議是羣醜畢集的結合（四）解散非法組織的叛逆（六）剷除一切寡廉鮮恥的叛黨份子（七）肅清禍國殃民的閻錫山馮玉祥（八）緝辦變節求榮的汪逆精衛（九）擁護爲民奮鬥的蔣總司令（十）實行三民主義（十）（一）中國國民黨的忠實同志團結起來</p>

<p>蘭封之巨蠅玉瑛</p>
<p>巨蠅據云本月初旬蘭封城空中忽見巨蠅無數其體大竟與蜂蝶蝗蟲相等該地人民見之均驚惶失措退避三舍甚恐被其傷害雖盛熱亦不敢露天睡覺據云蘭封以前從無此種巨蠅再隣近各縣現亦有同様事件發生亦云奇矣</p>
<p>没收時楊媳之全副裝奩亦在其内前巿長周象賢履新之始目覩太好奩具爲巿内僕嫗搬移使用不無殘缺之虞因糞除一室封鎖保存之當時府内職員有將裝奩標賣移充善舉或撥作某學校開辦費之議以資紀念而免蠹腐經周氏全部拒絶此華美之奩具得以暫時無恙並免流落人間焉</p>
<p>論者謂周氏此舉不能利用廢物徒擁保存之名非政治經濟家所宜出也或謂周氏能從大處着想其所以必欲保存者大可假此而儆府員之貪腐者固不在區區數千金之是圖此正政治經濟家所宜出耳</p>
<p>今蔡增基氏代周氏而長杭巿府矣不知對此奩具問題如何措置亦有所籌畫否邪</p>

<p>He Jian's Troops Approach Yuelu Mountain</p>
<p>Nanjing Military News: He Jian, due to frequent bandit disturbances, has concentrated various Hunanese troops in Xiangtan and telegraphed Jiangxi requesting the dispatch of troops to block the border. The New Second Division has now reached Jinjing and awaits orders. (1st)</p>
<p>Nanjing Navy News: The naval vessel "Yongsheng," despite the shallow waters of the Xiang River, ventured forward and ultimately recaptured Changsha from the hands of the communist bandits. Simultaneously, it drove out the communist bandits, comforted the residents, and telegraphed troops to come and take over defense. (1st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping (Beijing): British sources received a report from Changsha on the 31st stating that most of the communist forces in Changsha were Zhang Guitang's troops, who had occupied Changsha and Yueyang the previous month. (1st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou: He Jian's army intends to retake Changsha. His troops are ready. An advance team of 600 men has approached Yuelu Mountain. His main force of approximately 6,000 men has reached a point six or seven miles upstream from Changsha. Witnesses saw a portion of the communist army crossing the river to Zhongdao (Middle Island) on the evening of the 31st, while the majority of the communist forces remained on the right bank to resist the punitive forces. It is said that the communist army is preparing to retreat towards Liuyang and Pingjiang. (1st Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping (Beijing): It is reported that American missionary Mr. Lingel has left Changsha. Currently, only Mr. Kaemmerer, an American resident, remains there. Father Pei Ma is reportedly detained by the communists but is safe and sound. It is believed that most of the communists have left Changsha. (1st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou: According to a telegram received from Changsha at 00:00 this afternoon, the communist army has again constructed defensive positions along the right bank upstream near the Japanese consulate, setting up several machine guns and field artillery pieces. (1st Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou: The remaining Japanese in Changsha, at 5:00 PM on the 31st, inspected the situation upstream aboard the "Kōnan Maru" when they were suddenly fired upon by the communist army. Niimi Koying, responsible for protection, immediately returned fire with an 8mm machine gun. The Japanese ship was hit several times but fortunately suffered no damage. (1st Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou: According to a subsequent report assessing the extent of the damage in Changsha, the British Consulate, Customs House, Nisshin Kisen (China-Japan Steamship Company) residence, and Japanese naval dormitory were not burned. They still exist in their original appearance. These buildings are all located in the Zhongdao (Middle Island) area. (1st Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Various Nations Will Lodge Protests, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Received Japanese Note, Wang Zhengting's Remarks to Japanese Reporters</p>
<p>Beiping (Beijing): Britain, America, and Japan have agreed to have their respective envoys lodge protests with the Nanjing government regarding the Red Army's devastation of foreign residents and property in Changsha, reserving the right to present claims for damages at any time. (1st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing Diplomatic Circles News: The Envoy Corps is planning to lodge a protest with the Chinese government regarding the communist bandit disaster in Hunan and hopes for a speedy remedy. Also, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires came to Nanjing today to discuss the aftermath for Japanese residents in Changsha. (1st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>○ Kobe: Today, major newspapers in Tokyo are commenting on the Changsha Incident. The "Kokumin Shimbun" (The Nation's News) details the development of communist activities and warns the great powers that the strength of this terrifying destructive activity is increasing daily. It suggests that countries should prepare the necessary protection for their nationals residing in China. Commentators in official circles believe that the countries concerned may need to resort to diplomatic intervention, but the Japanese government's attitude remains calm. (1st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Regarding the demands made by various countries to the National Government concerning the Changsha Incident, compensation for losses is naturally expected. However, the National Government received a report stating that a female missionary from a certain country refused the advice of her country's consul to evacuate and insisted on staying in Changsha. Therefore, the National Government maintains that it will not provide compensation for loss of life in such circumstances. Consequently, the negotiations on this case may not be resolved quickly. (31st Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received any detailed reports regarding the Changsha Incident, except for a report from the Consul-General in Hankou that the Japanese Consulate was burned down. (1st Rengo News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu received a note from Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara on July 31st to be submitted to the National Government. It was delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Mr. Kamimura, the Japanese Consul in Nanjing, today. The gist of the note stated that regarding the handling of the aftermath of the Changsha Incident, the Japanese government will negotiate with the National Government after all the facts are clarified. However, as there are many Japanese residing in the Yangtze River region engaged in various businesses, the Japanese government calls the National Government's attention to this point and hopes that it will take appropriate measures promptly. (1st Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Today, Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting made the following remarks during a regular meeting with the Japanese press corps: Regarding the Changsha riot case, the government has not yet received a detailed report and is therefore not very clear about it. It is heard that the communist bandit army even committed the atrocity of burning down the consulate. The National Government is currently planning to first restore order in the area, arrest the principal offenders, and then negotiate in accordance with international practice to reach a satisfactory resolution. This incident was a sudden outbreak due to the opportunity presented by the relatively thin military strength of the Central Army in the area. It was truly an unexpected disaster, and there seems to be a reactionary faction behind it. Such unexpected disasters have precedents in other countries, so in this regard, we hope that the various nations will understand. It is heard that two Europeans are missing, and one has been kidnapped, which is truly hateful. The government will do its best to rescue them from danger. (1st Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Great attention is being paid to the activities of the Communist Party in Changsha and other places. Newspapers, political circles, etc., are reacting calmly to the burning down of the Japanese Consulate General. At today's cabinet meeting, the Foreign Minister and the Navy Minister both presented reports on the situation in China. It was then decided that the Foreign Minister would take charge of handling diplomatic affairs. It is reported that the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in China has been instructed to declare to the National Government that Japan reserves the right to demand compensation for losses and requests continued and increased protection. However, it is reported that the Japanese authorities express sympathy for the difficult situation of the National Government. Newspapers all have editorials commenting on the Red atmosphere in central China. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing: Zhang Kailian, Hunan Provincial Commissioner and concurrently Finance Commissioner, telegraphed Tan Yankai and Song Ziwen from Hankou on the 31st, reporting that Peng Dehuai and others had led bandit troops in a fierce attack on Changsha. Our side had only four regiments to defend. After five days and nights of intense fighting, all the punitive divisions were far away in the Guizhou region and the Hongjiang and Changde areas, and it was impossible to send reinforcements in time. On the 27th, the bandit troops took advantage of the weakness and launched a fierce attack. He Yun, the civil administrator, personally supervised the battle, but the disparity in strength was too great, and the four walls of the city were under siege. As a result, the city fell at 12:00 AM that night. Yun Gong hurriedly retreated and hid in the homes of civilians. He did not escape danger until the 29th, when he found a boat from Sanshaji to Hankou. All provincial organs in the provincial capital, such as the Provincial Government Headquarters, were burned down. Documents and equipment were completely destroyed, and public and private losses are incalculable. There are no tears to shed. Yun Gong is now in Yuanjiang and Yiyang, dispatching troops for a vigorous counterattack. The Chen Guangzhong and Peng Weiren brigades can be concentrated within days, and recovery can be expected soon. In addition to reporting the above to the Wuhan General Headquarters, I am specifically telegraphing you. I plan to go to the capital immediately to present the details in person.

<h3 id="e10">The Issue of Leadership Change in the British and American Major Parties <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>A Washington dispatch yesterday stated that the National Republican Party Chairman, Mr. Huston, has resigned. President Hoover's faction intends to promote Mr. Fess to succeed him. A London dispatch yesterday stated that the movement to replace Labor Party leader MacDonald with Henderson is gaining momentum. These two parties are the major ruling parties in the United States and Britain, and whether their leaders are competent is not only related to the rise and fall of a single party but also has a significant impact on the stability of the political situation and the prospects of the general election.</p>
<p>The policies of the Republican Party in the United States have recently lost the trust of the general public. The biggest reason for this is that President Hoover declared that he would protect the interests of farmers when he took office, and therefore received enthusiastic support from farmers. However, the publication of the new tariff is contrary to the initially established policy, and the planned methods for helping farmers have not been implemented. As a result, he has lost the sympathy of farmers. It is reported that Mr. Fess has considerable ties with farmers in the Midwestern United States, so he wants to use them to regain the feelings of farmers, that is, to consolidate the strength of the Republican Party in preparation for the general election in the future.</p>
<p>As for the British Labor Party, its unity has recently become less firm than before, and other parties are constantly obstructing it. If the Liberal Party can compromise with the Labor Party, the political situation will be easier to handle. However, judging from the last vote in the House of Commons on amending the financial bill, the government was fortunate to avoid defeat thanks to the opposition of four Liberal Party votes, but more than ten other members did not participate in the vote. This proves that the majority of the Liberal Party is still unwilling to cooperate with the Labor Party, and the Conservative Party has recently proposed more and more motions against the Labor Party to attack the government. Under these circumstances where MacDonald cannot maintain the situation, and various difficult problems continue to arise, replacing the leader may be able to temporarily change the atmosphere and open up a new situation for development in the upcoming general election. It was once rumored that MacDonald would resign as leader of the Labor Party, but this did not materialize, probably because a suitable successor had not yet been found.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Wang Zhengting Receives Newspaper Reporters <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting received reporters from various newspapers in and outside the capital at 11:00 AM on the 1st in the department's auditorium and reported the following: Since its establishment, the National Government's foreign policy has been to seek international equality, and therefore it has actively abolished various unequal points and signed new equal treaties to replace them. Regarding the issues in unequal treaties, such as the tariff issue, this goal has been completely achieved. The issue of abolishing extraterritoriality has also progressed by 70-80% and is proceeding very smoothly. However, due to the many accidents in the country, there are still five or six countries that have not properly resolved this issue. The reason for this delay is that Yan and Feng betrayed the Central Government, which caused this situation. If we do not want to seek international equality, that is one thing. If we want to seek international equality, we must first unite internally. We must regard those unscrupulous citizens who use the power of foreigners to maintain their personal power as a precursor to national subjugation and should work together to correct them. The purpose of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's promotion of revolution was to seek national unity and China's freedom and equality. In his dying will, he repeatedly exhorted comrades to seek national unity. Now, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is supervising the battle in the front, which is in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings to seek domestic unity and international equality. All citizens should unite to support the government to achieve this goal. As for the diplomatic aspects, there are several points that can be reported: (1) Sino-Russian Negotiations: Our representative Mo is still discussing the date of the meeting with Karakhan. Karakhan demands that the discussion include issues other than the East China Railway issue. Our side believes that Sino-Russian negotiations arose from the East China Railway issue, and the scope can only be limited to the East China Railway issue. After this issue is resolved, the Chinese government will naturally have the possibility of discussing other Sino-Soviet issues. Currently, Mo and Karakhan are in contact, and there are no concrete results. (2) Polish Treaty: Previously, due to the occurrence of doubts, the Polish representative and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs signed an agreed-upon protocol, which has been sent to the Polish government and will arrive soon and can be approved. The Chinese side will also send the treaty protocol to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval within this month. (3) The Cuban and Peruvian treaties have the same content, but there is still one point on which the two sides cannot agree. This point is closely related to the treatment of overseas Chinese, so the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is unwilling to give up easily. Therefore, the dispute between the two sides is fierce, and it is feared that they will not be able to reach a signing goal for a while. (4) Shanghai French Business Water and Electricity Workers' Strike: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with the local authorities, is negotiating. As of the 31st, there is no proper solution. Regarding the Shanghai Concession telephone issue, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has long declared that it does not recognize the 40-year patent rights, because the concession is a leased area and its sovereignty should belong to our government. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs insists on this point. Regarding the matter of recovering telecommunications rights, in addition to negotiating with Great Eastern and Great Northern, negotiations have also been proposed regarding the submarine cables set up by Japan between Shanghai and Nagasaki. The Japanese side has agreed to send representatives to contact the Ministry of Communications authorities. (5) The new French Minister has officially taken office. Although he has not yet met the Chairman to present his credentials, all negotiations have begun. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared to telegraph the French Minister to come to the capital immediately to discuss extraterritoriality and other issues. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the ministers of various countries related to extraterritoriality are all scheduled to come to the capital at the beginning of September to negotiate, so I hope that the military can have a satisfactory conclusion before September so that diplomatic matters can be carried out more easily. Subsequently, various reporters asked if, according to reports in the Shanghai English newspaper, the Japanese Consulate in Changsha was also burned down in this Changsha disaster, and whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had expressed anything about it. Wang replied that according to reports, in this Changsha incident, the most government agencies and houses were burned down. Foreign houses were also burned occasionally, but no foreigners were killed or injured. The Japanese consulate is in the city, so it is inevitable that it will be robbed, but as of now, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Japanese Consulate in Beijing have not received an official report. If the consulate was indeed robbed, the government would express its regret. After answering, the meeting was adjourned. (1st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Beiping (Beijing): Today at 3:00 PM, Wang Jingwei told reporters at the his residence about the progress of party affairs, saying that he plans to use a committee system instead of a minister system.

Merchants cannot be forcibly divided. The Standing Committee and the organizational regulations of the various departments will be proposed on the 3rd. The candidates for the interview committee have also been internally determined. Yan is the chairman of the government, because since 1919, literati have only been decorations for military men, and military men regard themselves as the masters. He also said that he plans to meet with Yan and Feng on the Pinghan Line within a week, and he will focus on reorganizing party affairs. As for whether party representatives will be set up in the military in the future, it has not yet been decided. (1st Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e54">Long-Distance Flight Completed <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Arrived safely in Montreal yesterday morning</p>
<p>Engine trouble encountered en route, but quickly repaired</p>
<p>Reuters, Montreal, 1st: The R-100 safely docked at the Hubert airfield mast at 5:40 this morning, completing its long journey of over 3,000 miles.</p>
<p>Reuters, Montreal, 31st: The British airship R-100 radioed that it was about 200 miles from Montreal, with slight damage to the tail wing, reducing speed to 10 nautical miles per hour. Temporary repairs took 90 minutes, increasing speed to 20 nautical miles per hour. It is expected to arrive at the Hubert airfield in Montreal by midnight. The ship flew over Quebec tonight, and there were huge crowds cheering.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 31st: After battling wind and rain, the British airship R-100 crossed the Atlantic this morning at 3:00 AM and safely arrived at Belle Isle off the coast of Labrador. The flight time was slightly longer than that of the Zeppelin airship.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Saint Hubert, 1st: The British airship R-100 flew 70 miles south of here at midnight, currently in wind and rain, flying only 20 miles per hour. According to reliable sources, it will not land before dawn.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Montreal, 31st: The British airship R-100 is currently proceeding at an average speed of 36 miles in the area between Belle Isle and the St. Lawrence Valley. Aviation experts here consider its transatlantic flight to be extremely important. The success of this trip can save a lot of abstract research, because the airship is newly constructed and its design is specifically suited for transatlantic flight. Countless people have come from near and far to watch the airship land, even from thousands of miles away. Many have also come from the United States. The local police department has temporarily established regulations to maintain order and control traffic.</p>

<p>The crowd is orderly in Canada. All areas of the country are on holiday today. Wherever the airship passes, the streets are crowded with people. It is expected that the ship will arrive at the station around 7:00 PM today.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Quebec, 31st: The British airship R-100 encountered danger midway today due to a mechanical malfunction. While navigating near Quebec City, the engines suddenly stopped working and were left to drift in the wind. Fortunately, the crew on board worked hard to repair it gradually, restoring its navigation ability when it was 31 miles away from Crane Island, but the speed was greatly reduced to only 12 nautical miles. According to a radio message sent by the ship, it is feared that it will be delayed until tomorrow to reach Montreal. Experts are very concerned about this matter. According to them, if there is a problem with the machinery, and the wind conditions are not favorable when landing, there may be other dangers. Subsequently, another telegram was received stating that the machinery has been completely repaired and has reached the air 118 miles northeast of Quebec at a speed of 20 nautical miles at 4:10 PM. However, according to experts' predictions, the earliest time of arrival is feared to be tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Williams Town, 31st: The 10th gathering of the Political Science Department of Williams Town began today.

<h3 id="e60">Revision of the New U.S. Tariff <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>World News Agency, Washington: The U.S. government, in view of the widespread opposition to the new tariff law at home and abroad, is carrying out a major new plan. The content is to convene representatives of the trade communities of countries that have close relations with the United States to first hold a meeting of the U.S. Tariff Commission to discuss the new tariff law. The purpose is to allow representatives of various countries to reveal the unfavorable and discriminatory points of the U.S. tariff to various countries, and use the results as the opinion of the new Tariff Commission to submit to Congress for revision. Such a change in policy attitude in the United States, which has a protectionist trade tendency, is truly surprising. U.S. officials call this a spirit of fairness and friendship toward various countries. If various countries point out points that are considered discriminatory, and they are confirmed, they will be revised. As for why the United States had to come up with measures to promote revision immediately after implementing the new tariff, it is because the opposition of various countries to the new tariff exceeded expectations. Before the tariff was passed, more than 40 countries had issued protests. After it was passed, the first to implement retaliatory tariffs was Canada, followed by Spain. Various countries in Europe are also working together to take the same action. Domestic opposition is also intensified by the foreign situation and is becoming sharp. For example, Mr. Young said that politicians who set this tariff are more hateful than violent groups. With domestic public opinion boiling like this, the government has no choice but to follow suit and come up with tariff revision measures. The fundamental reason is that the American gold market has continued to be sluggish unexpectedly since the stock market panic last autumn. As a result, the domestic market has become increasingly narrow, and the significance of foreign trade has become increasingly expanded, while the export ratio of domestic products is only about 10%. After years of prosperity, the United States has encountered today's slump. If it wants to transform its domestic situation, it must strive for exports. At this time, if it builds a new tariff barrier and causes foreign retaliation, it will not be a good plan, so it has to engage in remedial measures.</p>
<h3 id="e61">British Labor Party Member Reprimanded <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 31st: Labor Party member Sandham recently said that a certain Labor Party member received bribes and was drunk in Parliament. This statement has been discussed in the Lower House and submitted to a committee for review. The layer of bribery is the most important thing reviewed by the committee members. After repeated investigations, the committee members unanimously believed that Sandham had defamed Parliament with a word that had no evidence and should be punished. Today, Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden suggested that the Speaker issue a severe reprimand. The majority agreed, so the Speaker issued a reprimand in a solemn tone. Sandham also sat armless and listened to the reprimand. This is a rare occurrence in the Lower House.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 31st: Independent Labor Party member Sandham once pointed out that Labor Party members are prone to accepting bribes and drunkenness. For the drunkenness layer, he has presented six witnesses. For bribery, he will not agree to present witnesses until he has a guarantee of immunity. Today, the House of Commons passed a resolution to punish Mr. Sang with 304 votes against 13.</p>

<p>Reuters, 31st, London: Conservative Chamberlain stated in the Lower House tonight that he originally wanted to ask the government to reconsider its decision not to invite representatives of the Simon Committee to attend the Round Table Conference, but this morning he received a letter from Sir Simon, saying that he very much hopes to have the opportunity to participate in the conference to explain the various clauses contained in the report, so that critics have something to rely on. He only knew that the government's method was to attract Indians to participate in order to avoid the Indians being unwilling to join when the investigating committee attended, so he hoped that the investigation team would still have the opportunity to participate in the discussion after the meeting. After Chamberlain read this letter, everyone said that the letter was appropriate and declared that he did not want to ask the government to consider its resolution again and would bear full responsibility in the future.</p>

<p>Xuzhou correspondence: The date for the great battle on the Jinpu Line is approaching. It originated from the Jin army retreating to Nanyi and Dawenkou, and then gathering heavy troops at Taian. Recently, the Jin army on the Longhai Line was transferred to the Jinpu Line to reinforce it. According to reports, in addition to the original Chuan Zuoyi department, Sun Chu's department, which was transferred from Longhai, has built fortifications near Taian, relying on the mountains to occupy them, and deployed defenses at Nanyi and Dawenkou, as well as the Ningyang area. Therefore, now the Feng army is solely responsible for the defense of the Longhai Line. As for the Sun Dianying department in Bozhou, Luyi, and Zhecheng, the central army on the Longhai Line has been cleared and is also taking an offensive posture on the Jinpu Line. Various new forces have increased their strength to the front. Han's army on the Jiaoji Line and the various armies in western Shandong are taking considerable flanking attacks. Zhang Huichang, director of the Aviation Administration, also came to Xuzhou from Nanjing by plane Corbin yesterday morning (29th), and immediately went west from Xuzhou to meet with General Commander Chiang, and returned to Xuzhou that night. This morning (30th), he took a plane north to Yanzhou to command the air force's second team, Zhang Tingli's fourth team, Yang Guanyu's fifth team, Tian Xi's reconnaissance team, Mao Bangchu, and others, all of whom have sailed to Nanyi, Dawenkou, Taian, Ningyang, and other places to drop bombs.

Today, military news from Jinpu is still silent, but the Central Army has taken an offensive posture, so the great battle will begin in the next few days. (30th)</p>

<p>_Wenhui Bao_, Gansu Correspondence, July 5th. The situation in Gansu has changed greatly in the past month. There have been two consecutive days of plentiful rain recently, the first rainfall of this scale in Gansu Province in three years. The people are exceedingly happy and hopeful for a good autumn harvest. Although the wheat harvest this year has not been good, it is expected that there will be no more famine after the autumn harvest. In the past, the province of Gansu suffered from banditry due to the weakness of the Feng army's defenses. Now the political situation has changed again. The Feng army has almost completely withdrawn from the province, and the counties have returned to the hands of the Gansu army. According to reports, this Gansu army is the old division of Zhang Zhaojia. After Feng Yuxiang's army was defeated at Nankou and retreated into Gansu, Zhang Zhaojia fled to Sichuan and traveled to Beiping via Hankou. His old troops also retreated into the mountains in the Northeast. The Feng army launched repeated attacks, but never succeeded. Until a month ago, when the Feng army went to Henan, the Gansu army reappeared, and they have been quite welcomed by the people wherever they have gone. It is said that their commander, De Gui (transliteration), is already near Lanzhou. Attention should be paid to this development, and it remains to be seen how it will be coordinated with other forces. Mr. Huang has also sent troops into Shaanxi to assist the Shaanxi army. It is said that Liu Yufen still has one division remaining in Shaanxi. The fierce fighting is now not far from Xi'an. Mr. Huang has declared his support for the National Government, and his soldiers treat foreigners very kindly, unlike the Feng army who were stationed in church schools and church properties.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Labor Unrest and Undercurrents in Party and Government <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence. Misunderstandings have arisen between the Party and the government in Qingdao City due to the rickshaw pullers' strike. The undercurrents have been quite strong in the past two days, and both sides have telegraphed the central government for instructions.</p>
<p>On the Party side, after more than one hundred rickshaw pullers went to the Party headquarters to petition on the 26th, and were arrested by the Public Security Bureau, the Party believes that the City Government is deliberately trying to undermine labor and disrupt Party affairs. Therefore, on the afternoon of the next day (the 27th) at 2:00 PM, an emergency meeting was convened. It was resolved to telegraph the central government to clearly order the punishment of Ge Jingen and to strictly order the City Government to release the arrested rickshaw pullers. At the same time, personnel were sent to comfort the arrested rickshaw pullers and to find ways to provide relief to the families of the arrested workers. The telegram to the central government is transcribed below: "The Qingdao Rickshaw Pullers' Guild colluded with the Social Affairs Bureau to forcibly increase rickshaw rentals by more than one-third. Rickshaw pullers were forced to strike. The City Government, disregarding the reputation of the government, sided solely with the capitalists, illegally disbanded the rickshaw pullers' union, and arrested rickshaw pullers everywhere, now totaling three or four hundred. Today, more than one hundred rickshaw puller representatives, formerly five hundred, were going to the City Government, which ordered more than five hundred armed police and plainclothes detectives to severely surround the Party headquarters as if facing a formidable enemy. Petition representatives were arrested as soon as they came out, forcing most representatives to take temporary shelter in the auditorium. At 3:00 PM, the armed police, under orders from their superiors, charged into the City Party headquarters with weapons and live ammunition. They arrested everyone indiscriminately, and those arrested were subjected to cruel beatings without exception. Committee members Li and Wu were imprisoned for a long time. Comrade Zhou Shenfu, secretary of the training department, was also detained. All offices and staff dormitories within the Party headquarters were thoroughly searched under the pretext of hiding reactionary elements, and countless important documents were lost. All internal and external communication of the Party headquarters was cut off, and the staff have lost their freedom of action. Such destruction of labor, creation of rear unrest, and disruption of Party affairs, recklessly risking reactionary wrongdoing, truly calls for tears over the future of the revolution. We implore you to immediately issue an urgent telegram to stop this and severely punish them to quell the public's anger. We are infinitely eager."</p>
<p>On the City Government side, the City Government's reasons are that it has received orders from the central government to suspend all labor movements during the military period. Now that the military situation at the front is tense, rear defense is especially important. The City Party headquarters is the highest Party organ in the city. The labor union cannot respect the orders of the central government and continues to engage in labor movement activities. The City Party headquarters should be stopped. How can the City Party headquarters, instead of stopping it, indulge in and protect the already resolved labor unrest by listening to the instigation of the labor union and convening a large number of workers at the City Party headquarters to hold secret meetings to incite the labor unrest? The City Party headquarters not only treats the orders of the central government as mere formalities, but also puts national affairs and the Party's position behind its mind. It has truly lost the qualifications of a Party member. In order to maintain local security, the City Government had no choice but to suppress it. Therefore, after arresting the petitioning rickshaw pullers, and because the _Republic Daily_ and the _Qingdao People's Daily_ were doing their best to publicize for the Party headquarters, reversing right and wrong and slandering the government, it was temporarily ordered to cease publication today, and the handling of the labor unrest was telegraphed to the central government. The telegram is as follows: (1) "At noon yesterday, the Industrial and Commercial Integrity Society coerced more than eighty rickshaw puller leaders to secretly deliberate in the Party headquarters auditorium to re-ignite the labor unrest and try to expand it. Many people were assigned to stop nearby police officers from reporting to the bureau. Bureau members were insulted and driven out. The situation was extremely serious. The Municipal Government had no choice but to request the Party headquarters to hand over the rickshaw pullers and send police to the auditorium where they were meeting to interrogate the rickshaw pullers separately. The most vicious elements who have been causing trouble in recent days are mostly inside, which further confirms that the labor unrest was indeed incited by those attending this meeting. Since disbanding the gathering, the city situation has gradually stabilized and the people's hearts have settled. If there are no complications, it should be able to end. However, the Party headquarters itself made the utensils in each room look messy and destroyed, and took videos, presumably to falsely accuse others. The police team, in handling this matter, did not enter any other place except for the entrance to the auditorium where the meeting was held. We are sincerely afraid of using falsehood to confuse the truth and fabricating reports to cause misunderstandings. In addition to ordering the bureau to carefully and cautiously release the people brought to the bureau for separate interrogation and to carefully prevent and maintain order, we respectfully report this by telegram." (2) "Li Yizhong, etc., appointed by the Qingdao Municipal Committee, secretly gathered rickshaw pullers to re-ignite the labor unrest, and even directed the staff to sabotage the Party headquarters and falsely accuse our department of doing so. Such rascality is truly unexpected. They are doing their best to publicize through the newspapers and news agencies they run, hoping to confuse the public. However, rumors of strikes and market closures in Qingdao City are rampant, causing alarm. Allowing them to reverse right and wrong and slander the government is feared to affect the people's hearts and concern the overall situation. We respectfully follow the Commander-in-Chief's instructions and temporarily order them to cease publication and prohibit the issuance of disruptive slogans and leaflets, etc., and await instructions from the central government. The rickshaw puller labor unrest in Qingdao City has now been completely quelled. Please release us from our worries and quickly grant us a thorough investigation to clarify the truth." A telegram was also sent to Committee Member Chen Guofu: "The rickshaw puller labor unrest has continued for seven or eight days. The police team has been on alert day and night, advising and exhausting themselves. We desperately hope for an early end. Yesterday, 80% to 90% had resumed work, but Li Yizhong, etc., re-induced more than eighty rickshaw puller leaders to secretly deliberate in the Party headquarters auditorium to re-ignite the labor unrest and try to expand it, and forbade the police and report bureau police teams to see what was already finished and would start again, which is especially worrying. We originally planned to wait for the rickshaw pullers to disperse to the Party headquarters entrance and separately summon them for interrogation, but Li realized this and did not allow them to go out. The bureau then reported to the Municipal Government and sent a letter to the Party committee to hand over the rickshaw pullers. Li then cursed and claimed that the rickshaw pullers were there to petition and that the police team was not allowed to do anything. The police team had no choice but to call the rickshaw pullers to the auditorium door and bring them to the bureau for interrogation. It was found that all the wanted thugs and instigators were inside, and according to their confessions, it was further confirmed that the labor unrest was indeed caused by the Party headquarters. At 2:00 PM, the first phase ended, and the city situation became more stable. Unexpectedly, Li then directed his staff to sabotage the utensils in each room and arranged them properly. He invited reporters and Comrade Zhang Daofan, etc., to view and pointed out that the police team had done it, causing Comrade Zhang, etc., to be almost deceived. In fact, the police team did not recklessly enter his room outside the auditorium. Moreover, since the rickshaw pullers had already been brought to the bureau, why would he sabotage it himself? A little calm observation would reveal the truth. We originally did not bother to argue about such rascal behavior, but we are afraid that rumors will be distorted and considered a weakness in the conflict between the Party and the government, causing comrades to feel pain and enemies and foreigners to laugh at us. Therefore, we especially enumerate this to hopefully inform the central government in detail." (28th)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Rioters in Xiamen Cause Disturbances <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence. Yesterday (the 25th), there were again rioters in Xiamen causing disturbances and looting the Salt Affairs Bureau's inspection station. Military police surrounded and attacked them, killing two. At the same time, prisoners in the Siming County Prison also took the opportunity to break out of prison, escaping twenty-eight people. Three have been recaptured. A part of Xiamen Port in Xiamen City is in turmoil, while the rest is very calm. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Earlier, on the 24th, the military police authorities had received secret reports that rioters would cause disturbances the next day. That evening, Public Security Bureau Chief Zhang Xijie, under orders from the Command Headquarters, held an emergency meeting at the bureau. As a result, it was decided to divide the military police into different routes to lie in wait and strictly prevent disturbances in the Xiamen Port area. The deployment was divided into sections. The first section, the Penggong Temple area, was the responsibility of He Zhixing's unit of the Hutaizhou Battalion. The second section, the Dashengli area, was the responsibility of the Public Security Bureau's Security Team. The third section, the Chutoushan area, was the responsibility of Police Third Station Chief Wang Zongshi, who led the Browning pistol team. The fourth section, the Third Market area, was the responsibility of the Siming County Government's Detective Team and the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team. In addition, the First and Second Stations were responsible for maintaining security in Xiamen City. The deployment was completed at night. At about 7:00 AM on the 25th, three rioters suddenly came to the second floor of the Xiamen Salt Affairs Bureau's salt inspection station at the former Sijiangbieye Fish Market in Xiamen Port. Two of them went upstairs to the station chief's office. Station Chief Lin Buzhen and Accountant Lin Zuji were still in bed. The rioters first threw down the telephone receiver, leaving it hanging, so that there would be no ringing sound. Lin immediately woke up and threatened them with his hand, ordering them to hand over the money cabinet key and the uniform cabinet key. As a result, they only got the money cabinet key. At the time, the Salt Bureau employees were having breakfast in the downstairs living room. Two of them went upstairs, thinking they were visiting friends, and did not suspect anything. At the same time, there was a loud sound of firecrackers outside the bureau. The crowd went out to watch the excitement. One rioter outside the bureau raised a gun to stop them. The two rioters upstairs also went downstairs at this time and left together. The two Lins left the room and shouted that they had been robbed. The people downstairs were shocked, and the rioters used the firecrackers as a signal. The rioters outside the bureau scattered in all directions with propaganda leaflets. The Fish Market happened to be in the center of Xiamen Port. The military police who were lying in wait in various sections heard the sound of firecrackers and rushed to the scene in separate teams. At the same time, they sounded sirens. The rioters, about thirty in number, heard the sound and fled towards the back hill. The military police pursued them from behind. For a time, the sound of gunfire and firecrackers rang out. The Siming County Government's Guard Team at the foot of the hill behind the County Government saw the rioters escaping towards the County Government's back hill and also opened fire, and the rioters fired back, escaping up the hill. When the Fish Market incident occurred, the prisoners in the Siming Prison inside the County Government also rioted. The County Government's Guard Team was helping to attack the fleeing rioters and had no time to take care of the prisoners. More than 340 prisoners were able to escape. The prison guards were unable to control them. The prison doors were completely destroyed. They climbed over the walls and escaped to the back hill. Twenty-eight people escaped. Fortunately, the military police rushed to the scene, and the remaining prisoners dared not escape again. They repaired the prison doors while military police teams entered the mountains to search for the fleeing rioters. As a result, they captured a rioter in Western clothing on the Fish Market beach, carrying a hand grenade and propaganda leaflets, and shot him dead on the spot. Another worker-like person was captured by the military police while carrying a gun and distributing propaganda leaflets along the road. He was taken to the Fish Market beach and shot dead. The person in Western clothing was identified as Zhu Yuyi, a native of Pinghe. When the Fish Market riot occurred, he was frequently waving a gun in his right hand and a hat in his left hand, appearing to be directing the rioters, but his name has not been confirmed. Also, on the night of the 24th, the Maritime Public Security Bureau was ordered by the Command Headquarters to guard the sea. At about 4:00 AM the next morning, they used the First and Second steamships and several other hired merchant steamships to patrol the sea area near the Fish Market, Dashizi, the Electric Light Factory, and Xiamen University. Therefore, the rioters dared not escape to the sea after the incident, but escaped to the back hill. At about 8:00 AM, the Maritime Police saw a person in black shirt and pants, barefoot, running away on the Dashizi coast with a grenade wrapped in white cloth in his right hand. They captured him. He confessed that his name was Su Liancheng, a native of Huian. He was later taken away by the Command Headquarters. A total of twenty-eight prisoners escaped from the prison. Zhang Li and three others were recaptured. One person (named Zeng Yan, suspected of being a communist) was also shot dead in the back hill after he was captured. Eleven people were also captured near Xiamen Port, but their names have not yet been announced. (26th)</p>

<p>○Zhejiang-Haiyan Ninghai Dike Failure Causes Disaster, Haining Correspondence. The Zongzihao stone dike near Xincang, Haiyan, experienced a dike failure on the 28th. Engineer Wang and engineers of the Haining Dike Works Bureau immediately supervised the workers to use mud bags and wooden stakes to block it as best as possible. However, the tide was so strong that it washed away again after twelve hours, and the seawater poured into the inner dike, becoming even more turbulent. On the evening of the 29th, the Junzihao Chenfenggang area, about eight li west of Zongzihao, was also washed away by the seawater, and the new dike (i.e., the Hangping Highway) was breached. Therefore, the Hangping Highway bus service has been suspended since the 30th. The breach is about two zhang four or five chi wide. The seawater flows into the inner river from the breach like a waterfall. The Yuanhua Dike River has already mixed with a large amount of seawater, which will have a significant impact on farmland. On the day of the dike failure, Mr. Dengke, an Austrian engineer from the Water Conservancy Bureau, and Engineer Wang of the Hanghai Dike Works Office both arrived at the construction site one after another to inspect and devise methods to repair the breach. The workers, including 200 hired from Hangzhou and 400 local workers, were busy carrying mud and driving piles. There were a total of twenty-seven cargo trucks from the Hangzhou Cargo Truck Company transporting sacks of mountain firewood day and night. They were working hard. As of the 31st, a total of 3,100 sacks and 40,000 bundles of mountain firewood had been used, which shows the scale of the project and the severity of the disaster. The dike opposite the Huaruemiao Temple, about twelve li west of Junzihao, also collapsed, and the seawater flowed in unabated. The seawater in the area near Junzihao is about eight chi above the mulberry fields, and all the crops there have been washed away. In total, the dangerous situation from Zongzihao to Panzihao is about twelve li, and it is about to become a major disaster. The Hanghai Dike Works Office has concentrated all its efforts on repairing the breach. They are working very hard. Unexpectedly, the stone dike from Xiaoputuo west of the near city to the seaside park was also eroded by the tide, with hundreds of holes and wounds, and the danger is alarming. The county Party headquarters, in view of the repeated collapses of the sea dikes and the imminent threat to the lives of the entire county, sent an urgent telegram to the province yesterday, requesting the Water Conservancy Bureau to expedite repairs to relieve the disaster.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence. The levees and dikes of the Hanghai Forts were severely damaged by the recent hurricane. More than ten zhang of the main dike was destroyed. Today (the 1st) at 8:00 AM, Secretary Jiang and Section Chief Zhu Chongguang of the Construction Department were dispatched to investigate. After arriving in Haining, Secretary Jiang and others met with Wang Shoubao, director of the Dike Works Office, to conduct an on-the-spot inspection of Jiubao and Shierbao. From the Haining bus station to Jiubao is about 20 li, and the mulberry fields along the way are lush. The breach there is in the inner dike, and the situation is relatively moderate. The damage is related to Shierbao, so the breach is only about two zhang, and it has already been repaired without any problems. From Jiubao to Shierbao is about 8 li, and the breach is in the outer sea dike, about twelve zhang. It was washed away by two angry tides. The first time, the stones of the main dike were washed away. The second time, the mud dike was washed away, and the tide poured into the inner dike. Now that the tide has receded, the water in the inner dike is pouring out towards the breach and retreating into the sea. Fortunately, the Dike Works Bureau had previously installed large strip stones under the main dike, otherwise the breach would have expanded. Now, after the Dike Works Bureau devised methods to repair it, the earthen dike was first reinforced with wooden piles and dike firewood, and mud was packed in sacks to fill the breach. After the water recedes completely, the stone dike will be repaired. There are hundreds of local people working there. If there are no major storms in the coming days, other problems should not arise. It is reported that the Construction Department believes that the losses from each angry tide washing away the dike are very large, and the cost of repairs every year is enormous. If the mountain in the middle of Biezimen were blasted away, the tide would be slowed down and would not cause such damage. The annual repair cost could also be saved. A fundamental solution is now being planned to achieve permanent stability.</p>

<p>The price of grain in the Hangzhou market has been falling this past week. Rice sold by stores was reduced by four jiao per dan (unit of measure) from the day before yesterday. Now, due to the continuous wind and rain, the transport and sale of new grains from various places have been suspended, causing the price of rice in the market to suddenly rebound by about one yuan yesterday and today.</p>
<p>Yuyao is a special salt production zone, with more than 100,000 salt workers. Currently, the northwest districts of the county have reported banditry and smuggling. The Sixth Business Division has transferred salt police to suppress the situation. The Salt Yard Office has also consulted with the Weighing and Releasing Bureau staff to agree on joint defense measures. A report on the arrangements has been submitted to the province, stating that the local area is now calm.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province has a total of four forest farms: the First Forest Farm in Xichao Township, Hangzhou, the Second Forest Farm in Jiande, the Third Forest Farm in Lishui, and the Fourth Forest Farm in Baiguan, Shaoxing. Now, in order to expand, the Construction Department plans to add branch farms in Dongtianmu, Cao'e, and other places. The expenses are planned to be allocated from the increased forestry fees in the 19th fiscal year. A proposal has been submitted to the provincial government for review and approval.</p>

<p>Continuation of the Bandit Robbery Case in Hougang: It is reported that on the 30th evening, more than 30 bandits speaking local dialects suddenly arrived in Hougang Town, under the jurisdiction of the county. Carrying weapons, they raided Xu Yuxing's foreign goods store. The store owner, Xu Weiru, and two sons of a Mr. Wang (Wang Wangyun's sons) were kidnapped and taken away amidst shouts. It is said that the town had previously received a letter from the bandits demanding a ransom of 4,000 yuan to be delivered to a certain tavern next door to the Fourth Avenue in Shanghai, otherwise they would carry out kidnapping and robbery. At the time, everyone thought it was a threat, but it unexpectedly became a reality.</p>
<p>Tianmashan Sends Personnel to Re-seal: In the case of the Jiuxi Company's quarrying of stones in Tianmashan, the Agricultural Department ordered the county to seal it off for violating mining regulations. The county magistrate sent Inspector Zhang from the Public Security Bureau to implement the sealing. Unexpectedly, the mine operator refused to comply and continued quarrying. Recently, two stone crushing machines were newly transported from Shanghai and were about to be actively put into operation. The county government learned of this through investigation. Magistrate Jin believed that the merchant's defiance was improper, so he sent section member Qian Guangda together with Zhu Ying, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to the countryside one day to investigate. Since the responsible personnel of the company were all in Shanghai, they complied with the order and affixed county government seals to the front and back of the mountain. They also ordered the local land guard and the sub-station patrol leader to sign a guarantee, ordering them to stop the quarrying nearby. The two stone crushing machines were ordered to have the foreman instruct the Shanghai merchant to transport them back, otherwise they would be sealed off.</p>
<p>The General Clearing Bureau Officially Established: The local affairs of this county clearing out bandits has convened various meetings by the County Magistrate to prepare. Officially established at 9:00 a.m. one day, it is attached to the county government. Magistrate Jin concurrently serves as the director, Zhu concurrently serves as the deputy director, Li Zihua is the director of the first section, and Ni Guangrong is the director of the third section. The clerks and recorders of the bureau are Zhang Yinian and Ye Shaoyan, who originally held positions in the county government, to save on expenses.</p>

<p>Female Students of Jinan University Falsely Accused and Escorted to Zhenru, Shanghai: Fan Kangyuan, the secretary-general of Jinan University, reported to the local Public Security Branch on July 17th that female students Zhong Xiuying, Chen Jianru, Peng Miaoxian, etc., were secretly holding a meeting in Room 5 of the seventh dormitory, suspected of being reactionary. The branch immediately sent Patrol Leader Gu to lead the police to take the three female students Zhong Xiuying, Chen Jianru, and Peng Miaoxian to the bureau for a brief interrogation. The next day, the 18th, they were handed over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for verification. As there were no suspicions after the interrogation, they were allowed to be released on bail. At that time, Peng Miaoxian was released on bail, but Zhong Xiuying and Chen Jianru were originally from Guangdong, and had no relatives in Shanghai, so they could not find a guarantor. On the 28th, the Public Security Bureau transferred them to the local court. After investigation, the prosecutor ordered them to be released on bail, but Zhong and Chen still could not find one. On the 1st, the police were dispatched to escort them to Suzhou and sent them to the Higher Court. Prosecutor Zhong Shangbin investigated and according to the statements, they were falsely accused because Fan Kangyuan, the secretary-general of Jinan University, was beaten by more than 100 students on July 14th, and then reported to the Public Security Branch on the 17th to have them taken away. After hearing the statements, Prosecutor Zhong ordered them to be sent to the Sijiang Street Detention Center to await interrogation as further investigation of evidence was required.</p>

<p>Four Children Drown While Practicing Swimming: Chen Huanwen, a resident near Chen Sifang in the tenth district of Xiyi (Beixiaxiang), is an elderly man who is deaf and works in farming. He has four sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Xianglin, is sixteen years old, the second son, Xiangfeng, is twelve years old, the third son, Xiangsheng, is seven years old, and the fourth son, Xiangzhen, is five years old. Except for the youngest son who has not yet entered school, the rest are all studying at a certain elementary school. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon, the four brothers Xianglin went to a nearby river to cool off and play. Before long, they saw village children swimming in the river in the distance. Xianglin, Xiangfeng, and Xiangsheng were eager to try, so they took off their shorts and went into the river to practice swimming. Unexpectedly, Xianglin and others did not know how to swim, and soon they drowned one after another. At that time, Xiangzhen, who was standing on the pier, saw this and was so anxious that he lost his footing and fell into the river and drowned instantly. Afterwards, Chen Huanwen and his wife learned that all four sons had died and were grief-stricken. Those who saw it were also saddened. They immediately bought four coffins and separately put them into coffins. It can be described as tragic.</p>
<p>The Case of Shooting Tan Qixuan Has Been Adjudicated: The case of Tan Qixuan, the former director of the Beishang Township Administrative Bureau of this county, being tragically shot and killed by bandits, has resulted in the county government successively arresting key criminals such as Lü Shiqiao, Bao Dayuan, Lü Genhu, Guo Asi, and Zhu Ada. After repeated summons and interrogations by Tang Yiqin, a member of the Committee for Clearing Accumulated Cases, the final debate was announced on the 25th of last month. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, the sentencing was held. Tang ascended to the criminal court and brought the five defendants, including Lü Shiqiao, to the court for sentencing. Lü Shiqiao was sentenced to death for the crime of inciting murder and deprived of all civil rights indefinitely. Bao Dayuan was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment for the crime of jointly committing murder with premeditation and deprived of all civil rights indefinitely. Lü Genhu, Guo Asi, and Zhu Ada were each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for the crime of conspiracy to kill, and deprived of civil rights for seven years. At that time, Lü Shiqiao's face turned pale upon hearing the verdict and immediately declared that he would not accept it and filed an appeal, requesting that the judgment be delivered as soon as possible. Tang Jun approved it and immediately ordered them to be taken into custody for execution. Also, the defendant Sun Ruoxiu, after being transferred to Xiyi by the Higher Court, repeatedly requested a change of jurisdiction whenever the court was convened for interrogation, and claimed that he did not want to make any statements.

<p>Car Merchants Petition the Provincial Government Due to Price Cuts: The Zhenjiang rickshaw companies recently received instructions from the Construction Department to implement a price reduction for rickshaw rentals in the city and posted notices to inform the rickshaw pullers to implement it uniformly on August 1. The car merchants believe that since the provincial government moved to Zhenjiang, the prices of all goods have been high, and all industries are discussing price increases, but only rickshaw rentals are being reduced. In order to protect their capital, they find it difficult to accept this instruction. Therefore, yesterday, they hired lawyer Chen Liren to appeal to the provincial government. Moreover, there have been no recent disputes between labor and capital in this industry. Now, the sudden price reduction will inevitably lead to disputes.</p>
<p>New Prison Still Difficult to Construct: The Jiangsu Higher Court previously intended to build the Fifth Prison in Zhenjiang due to overcrowding in the prisons. It was estimated that it could accommodate a thousand people. The site has already been purchased with an advance payment, but the required funding is very large. An application for 300,000 yuan was previously made to the Department of Judicial Administration, and an instruction was received approving the transfer of 100,000 yuan from the Finance Department for temporary allocation. However, only 30,000 yuan has been received to date. After deducting the advance payment, there is not much left, which makes it impossible to start construction. Now, in addition to sending a letter to the Finance Department to expedite the allocation of the remaining funds, the Higher Court has also instructed the Zhenjiang county prison warden to build a bamboo fence around the perimeter of the purchased land.</p>

<p>Cloth Bureau Oversteps Authority and Detains Goods: The merchants in Zhejiang Province believed that the provincial Finance Department created the merchant-managed cloth donation tax to restrict the donation tax packages, and specially changed it to government-managed, setting up the Unified Cloth Donation Bureau, clearly defining the standards and ratios in order to verify and collect taxes. A General Bureau was established in the province, and a branch bureau was established in each region, appointing Hu Zutong as the director. Since the opening of the bureau, it has repeatedly mistakenly detained and levied excessive taxes on cargo transport outside of its scope. Merchants have requested the Finance Department to transfer orders for release based on reason. Recently, the Wenzhou branch bureau has again overstepped its authority and detained goods, and the local county party headquarters has reported the situation to the province, requesting the Finance Department to quickly stop it. The Finance Department believes that this is due to the bureau chief's improper employment and mismanagement. In addition to ordering the bureau not to engage in the aforementioned actions in the future, it is said that Bureau Chief Hu Zutong will be dismissed and replaced within days.</p>
<p>The Huge Fraudulent Gambling Case Is Handled: Xu Zhou, a native of Shaoxing residing in Dafuqing Lane in Hangzhou, has some assets. She was swindled out of 2,700 yuan by Xu Jifu, Lou Zhaorui, Zhu Jinshan, Zhong Santainiang, Zhang Guifang, and Zhang Yueting through fraudulent gambling. Xu Zhou realized this afterwards and reported it to the authorities. Lou Zhaorui, an important member of the fraudulent gambling gang, usually does all kinds of evil and has long been noticed by the authorities. After the report, he was caught by detectives from the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau in the Dongsheng Tea House, and Zhang Guifang and Zhang Yueting were also arrested at the same time and interrogated. Lou Zhaorui not only denied everything, but dared to falsely accuse detective Yuan Baichuan and others, saying that they had a personal grudge against him and framed him. Xu Zhou said that Lou had persuaded her on how to gamble and how to calculate, and then threatened her to pay the silver dollars, etc., all of which were done by Lou. Therefore, after interrogation, the detectives reported to Yan Youfu, director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, that swindling a woman out of a huge amount of money was a heinous social phenomenon. Therefore, after a retrial, in addition to issuing a general order to his subordinates to arrest Xu Jifu and other criminals who were still at large, he yesterday transferred the criminals to the court. However, Lou Zhaorui has not been arrested, so his criminal behavior has not been confirmed, and he has been temporarily released on bail.</p>

The Mongolian and Tibetan Education Department of the Ministry of Education is currently drafting measures for promoting phonetic symbols in Mongolia and Tibet. In addition to annotating the national pronunciation to the right of Chinese characters, it is planned to annotate the meaning of Mongolian and Tibetan to the left of the characters, and to annotate the local sounds of Mongolian and Tibetan as much as possible. After these promotion measures are formulated and announced, a general order will be issued to various leagues and banners to set up phonetic symbol training institutes to expand training and facilitate promotion.</p>
<h3 id="e104">The Academia Sinica to Move Entirely to Nanjing Next Year <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Due to the unresolved issue of the Qingliang Mountain site for the Academia Sinica, the Institute of Social Sciences and the Bureau of International Exchange of Publications, both located in Shanghai, have not yet been moved to Nanjing. Yesterday, a reporter interviewed Mr. Xu Weiman, the head of the Academia Sinica's affairs and director of the Bureau of International Exchange of Publications, at the Academia Sinica's general office. According to Mr. Xu, although the Qingliang Mountain site has been selected, the land price issue has not been satisfactorily resolved despite repeated meetings with the Land Bureau and landowners. Therefore, it is planned to construct a new building near the Astronomical Institute on the east side of Beijige to house the Institute of Social Sciences and the general office. Including the Astronomical Institute's library building, which is already under construction, the total construction cost is estimated to be around 100,000 yuan. The blueprints for the new building have been slightly modified, and the tender will be announced in about two weeks. Construction is expected to be completed in ten months, and it is anticipated that all institutes of the Academia Sinica will be moved to Nanjing by this time next year.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Hunan Province Urges the Implementation of Independent Educational Funding <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Electing Members to the Promoting Committee</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The issue of independent educational funding in Hunan Province has been advocated by educational personnel since the 13th year, but it has not yet been realized. Later, because the government vigorously maintained educational funding, in addition to allocating all the salt tax surcharge, it still found ways to raise the shortfall. Therefore, the heads of the schools did not rush to the government offices to request funding as before, but concentrated on the development of education, so that education in the 18th year had improved and was striving to expand. Now, because they feel that although the current government pays attention to educational funding, even a slight accident can fundamentally shake it, such as the influence of Gui's rebellion in Hunan, which has been affecting Xiangda for more than a month. Not only is there no funding for recurring expenses, but there is also not a single article for food expenses. Therefore, it is necessary to actively promote the independence of educational funding. Therefore, the principals, teachers, staff, and educational institutions personnel held a joint meeting at the Provincial Education Association on the 21st. More than 60 people, including Di Ang and Li Shiyuan, attended. Hu Yiru was elected as the chairman to report the reasons for the meeting, and then discussed each other for a long time and unanimously decided: (1) To organize the "Hunan Scholars to Promote Independent Education Funding Committee" and pass the organizational charter. (2) Elect Chen Runlin, Xiang Shaoxuan, Miao Yunan, Li Shiyuan, Hu Yiru, Li Yanjun, Lu Shengzhai, Di Ang, Luo Yi and other nine people as members. (3) The address of the Huang Association will be temporarily set up at the Provincial Education Association. (4) The expenses of this association will be shared by various schools. The meeting was adjourned and the adopted charter was recorded: Article 1: The purpose of this association is to promote independent education funding. Article 2: This association is jointly organized by all public and private schools and educational institutions in the province. Article 3: This association has nine members, who are elected by all public and private schools and educational institutions in the province. Article 4: This association has three standing members, who are elected by the members. Article 5: All members of this association are unpaid. Article 6: The staff of this association are concurrently held by the staff of the Provincial Education Association. Article 7: The expenses of this association are shared by all public and private schools and educational institutions in the province. Article 8: This association will convene an enlarged meeting of all public and private schools and educational institutions in the province when necessary. Article 9: The external documents of this association will borrow the seal of the Provincial Education Association. Article 10: This association will be dissolved when independent educational funding is implemented. Article 11: The charter of this association will be passed by a joint meeting of all public and private schools and educational institutions in the province and reported to the Department of Education for record and implementation.</p>

<p>According to a Dongbao Telegraphic dispatch, the Japanese student track and field team, which is on a European tour, arrived in Stockholm on July 26 and was welcomed by Mr. Aidosto Rom, President of the International Amateur Athletic Federation. At the dinner, Dr. Yamamoto, the leader of the expedition, inquired about Japan's chances of hosting the World Olympics in ten years. Mr. Aidosto Rom replied that Italy and Spain are currently competing eagerly to hold the games in 1940. However, if Japan obtains the support of powerful financial groups and the mayor of Tokyo, and organizes an Olympic Preparatory Committee with sports organizations, and contacts the International Olympic Committee early to send invitations to participate to various countries and actively promote the matter, then there may be a possibility of realization.</p>

<p>Raising 250,000 Gold</p>
<p>Remodeling the Meiji Jingu Swimming Pool</p>
<p>--To Be Completed by Next Summer--</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent) The Meiji Jingu swimming pool in Tokyo was hastily built for temporary use during the Far Eastern Games, and its facilities were inadequate. In order to renovate it according to the original ideal plan, Chairman Suehiro has been running around, but he has only been able to raise 30,000 yuan. At a time when he was in despair, he suddenly received the efforts of Dr. An Qingyi, Chairman of the Taixie Association, who secured a generous donation of 150,000 yuan from the Harada Accumulation Association. However, the lowest budget for construction is 250,000 yuan. It has been decided to start construction in October to rebuild the ideal facilities. The current grandstand only holds 8,000 people, and it will be expanded to accommodate 15,000 people. The main grandstand will be made of reinforced concrete with medical, administrative, and bathing facilities built underneath. There will also be 1,500 new-style steel clothing racks for men and women. In addition, electric lighting will be installed on the water surface, and wells will be dug to replace the water in the swimming pool. The project is expected to be completed next summer and will be the largest and most well-equipped swimming pool in the Orient.</p>

<p>Five Groups Competed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Open Tennis Doubles Championship opened yesterday with eight groups competing, five of which were held at the China Tennis Court. As the sun set and the evening breeze came, the intense heat dissipated. The players showed their skills on the grass, and the spectators were also very excited.</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang fought against Huang Wuru and Chen Jixiang. In less than half an hour, Huang and Chen only won one game, and Qiu and Jiang won 2-0. The match between the Westerners, Kanafan Luo and Tafuer Si, against MacSassy Smith and Graham was more exciting. Although the skills of Shi and Ge were not weak, they had no confidence in their serves, which led to many lost points. The net play of Kata was effective, and the serve of Ta was greatly improved. As a result, Kata won two sets in a row, 6-4 and 6-2. The results of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang defeated Huang Wuru and Chen Jixiang 6-0, 6-1. Hu Qifeng and Hu Qizhuo defeated Mao Honggui and Shen Bogui 11-9, 6-3. Guo Qida and Yuan Shilong defeated Xie Yongqin and Ling Yinlong 6-1, 6-3. Tafuer Si and Kanafan Luo defeated Smith and Graham 6-4, 6-2.

<h3 id="e115">City No. 1 Amateur Tennis Tournament <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the City No. 1 Public Sports Field Amateur Tennis Tournament had five matches. The results and the order for this afternoon and tomorrow morning are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yesterday's results:</p>
<p>Group | Player | Result | Score | Referee</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>France | Wang Wuchen | Defeated | Shen Yongnian | 1-6, 7-5, 6-4 | Guo Qida</p>
<p>Net | Zhang Xiaoqin | Defeated | Zhu Xiaozhong | 6-1, 6-3 | Sun Chuanxin</p>
<p>Net | Sun Chuanxin | Defeated | Wang Hongye | 6-2, 6-2 | Zhang Longhai</p>
<p>Elimination | Xu Qiaosheng | Defeated | Wu Maoqing | 6-4, 6-1 | Zhang Longhai</p>
<p>Net | Zhang Quansheng | Defeated | Yang Shiqing | 6-4, 8-6 | Sun Chuansheng</p>
<p>Turning defeat into victory. The battle between Shen Yongnian and Wang Wuchen was believed by observers to be certain victory for Shen. The result was unexpected. Wang succeeded with two wins against one. In the first set, Shen was excellent in his counter-attacks and forward net play, making Wang Wuchen unable to cope and only able to run around the court. The score was one to six. In the second set, Shen seemed to have the intention of letting Wang make three games first, and then chasing up to equality. However, in the seventh game, Wang cheered up and dealt a head-on blow, taking the victory again. Although Shen was able to retaliate in the eighth game, the ninth game was won by Wang again. Shen used all his strength to recover, with the battle reaching its climax. In the eleventh and twelfth games, Shen seemed flustered and made mistakes, losing the whole game with a score of five to seven. Although Wang was covered in sweat in the third set, his spirits were doubled, and the power of his shots was also stronger than before. Shen was exhausted after a long battle and was controlled by Wang. In the end, the victory belonged to Wang again with a score of six to four. In terms of skills, Shen was actually better than Wang. However, Wang's diligence in practice was the most among the hundreds of players. Every morning at five o'clock, he walked from his residence in Zhabei to the public sports field to practice, regardless of the cold or heat, for two years without interruption. His ability to fight for a long time without fatigue and turn defeat into victory was not accidental.</p>
<p>The skinny guy takes advantage of his strength. Wang Hongye is old and fat, and his qualifications for practicing tennis are longer. Sun Chuanxin is young and thin, and his history of practicing tennis is very short. The two fought vigorously at six o'clock yesterday morning. Wang has great strength and the ability to kill, while Sun is light and runs fast. Back and forth is a good sight. As a result, Sun won because of his better endurance. The score was 6-2, 6-2.</p>
<p>Wen 氽 (tǔn) water just became a pair. Wu Maoqing is famous for ping pong. His rebounds are sharp and unbeatable. However, in tennis, he is prudent and careful everywhere. His opponent, Xu Qiaosheng, is also like that. The two warm waters just became a pair. It takes a dozen back and forth to determine the victory or defeat of a ball. It can also be seen in his conservative work. As a result, Xu Qiaosheng won with a score of 6-4, 6-1.</p>
<p>The short-legged tiger meets the long man. Zhang Quansheng is very short and his skills are improving very quickly. He can attack and defend and is one of the bullies in the ball group. So his friends call him the short-legged tiger. Yesterday, he fought against Yang Shiqing, who is very tall. The confrontation between the north and the south is interesting. Although the tiger is fierce, the long man also has a long strength. After a long battle, the victory was decided. The god of victory abandoned people and took the tiger. The score was 6-4, 8-6.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Slight Disturbances in the Foreign Concessions Yesterday <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Areas Remained Quiet</p>
<p>The city implemented strict precautions yesterday. From 12:00 midnight the night before, Nanshi and Zhabei announced martial law and cut off traffic. The police departments of the British and French Concessions also implemented strict precautions. Therefore, except for slight disturbances in the Nanjing Road and North Sichuan Road areas of the Public Concession, no major incidents occurred yesterday.</p>
<p>In the Public Concession, around 9:30 yesterday morning, many men and women resembling workers and students gradually gathered in the area of Nanjing Road and Tibet Road. A shout was heard and leaflets were scattered, mixed with the sound of firecrackers, creating a very chaotic scene. The Laozha police station, which was in charge of the area, was already on alert, and Chinese and Western armed patrolmen immediately stepped forward to arrest the crowd. The crowd was dispersed, and the remaining crowd fled east along Lloyd Road and Zhejiang Road. Shops on both sides temporarily closed their doors to prevent accidents. The patrolmen chased after them and arrested eight people, who were sent to the police car parked on the road. Seeing that the situation was not good, the crowd scattered in groups of three or five and fled. At the intersection of Shanxi Road and Nanjing Road, three people were arrested by patrolmen from the Central Police Station. A police car was also parked at the intersection of Henan Road and Nanjing Road, and many armed patrolmen were on guard. Seeing the precautions, the crowd flocked to Sichuan Road and the Bund. However, the more radical ones still threw bricks and stones at the glass windows of shops when passing the intersection of Nanjing Road and Henan Road. The Chinese and Western detectives on guard stepped forward to disperse them. Although they did not succeed in their attempts, one or two places were damaged. The crowd then turned into Sichuan Road and headed east towards the Bund, passing over the Baidu Bridge and along North Suzhou Road towards Hongkou. The leaflets in their hands were no longer numerous, and they only shouted slogans along the way. Seven people were arrested in the Hongkou area, four of whom were released because they were not involved. Near Haining Road on North Sichuan Road, some people resembling workers were also found in the morning. However, the number was still small and they only threw leaflets into the trams. Around 11:00 in the morning, those found on the road were mostly from Nanjing Road and the Bund, but they no longer took any action.</p>
<p>In the French Concession, around 3:00 AM and 9:00 AM yesterday, leaflets were secretly distributed in areas such as Rue Massenet, Rue Paul Henry, and Route des Pères. By the time the detectives arrived, they had already fled without a trace. The Great World Amusement Park, which usually opens after 12:00 PM every day, was delayed until 2:35 PM yesterday before ticket sales began. At 5:30 PM, due to the large number of pedestrians in the area, the police station was notified to temporarily close the park until 8:10 PM, when it returned to normal.</p>
<p>In the Chinese areas of Nanshi, Zhabei, Xujiahui, Longhua, and Caojiadu, strict precautions were taken. All the key points were guarded by the Public Security Bureau with double posts armed with guns, which was very thorough. Pedestrians and vehicles that were slightly suspicious were checked. Soldiers were guarding at the Zhabei New Gate Bridge and the Hengfeng Road Bridge, and the situation was serious. From 12:00 midnight, the same measures as the night before were taken, with martial law implemented and vehicles and pedestrians prohibited from passing.</p>

<p>Labor-Management Disputes Should Be Handled in Accordance with Legal Procedures</p>
<p>A joint proclamation from the Songhu Garrison Command and the Shanghai Municipal Government stated: Regarding the fact that labor-management disputes in industry and commerce must be submitted to the competent authorities for mediation or arbitration in accordance with legal procedures, and strikes must not be carried out without authorization, proclamations have been issued and strictly prohibited in the past. It is now reported that there are unscrupulous people who are inciting strikes. At this time when the punitive military operations are progressing, the defense of the rear is of utmost importance and prohibitions should be reiterated and precautionary measures be taken. Any enterprise where a labor dispute occurs must first submit to the competent authorities for mediation or arbitration in accordance with the law and must not use strikes as a threat. Those who engage in unauthorized strikes without going through the mediation or arbitration process will be prosecuted by the military and police organs for disturbing public order and will not be treated with leniency. All must comply and not disobey. This is the proclamation.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Postal Service Dispute Negotiations <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Talks Between Both Sides Still Yield No Results</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Employees' Union previously submitted ten consolidated demands regarding long-standing issues to the postal authorities, setting a five-day deadline for a response, as reported in previous issues. It has now come to light that, with the deadline passed and no response from the authorities, the two unions sent representatives Zhu Xuefan, Zhang Kechang, and employee representatives Chuan Dewei, Chen Lingzhou, Kang Yong, and Shi Ji Kuan, seven in total, to the Postal Commissioner's Office for a meeting to ascertain the authorities' sincerity in providing a satisfactory response. Commissioner Wei Yifu was unable to come to Shanghai due to pressing matters at the Ministry of Transportation, so the union representatives were received by Yang Sili, secretary of the Commissioner's Office. After two rounds of talks, Secretary Yang conveyed the authorities' opinions to the representatives. The authorities indicated that they could accept or amend the following seven of the ten demands raised by the union: (1) revisions to the regulations for short, long, and sick leave, as well as new regulations for marriage, mourning, and regular leave for Chinese postal staff; (3) abolishing the messenger boy certificate and thoroughly improving their treatment; (6) restoring the "Personnel History" semi-monthly publication; (7) correcting General Bureau Order No. 208 regarding the Postal Commissioner's secretary enjoying the same treatment as postal staff; (8) stipulating that letter carriers injured on duty or elderly should become in-house letter carriers; (9) explicitly stipulating that letter carriers or messengers who have served for more than fifteen years can be promoted to postal assistants after a simple examination. Regarding (2) subsidies for the high cost of gold and low value of silver (an increase of one-eighth per month) and (10) improvements to the year-end bonus (employees with more than one year of service receive a bonus of one and a half months), the authorities indicated that they could not accept these because the total salaries of postal personnel nationwide amounted to 17 million yuan. An increase of one-eighth per month would require more than 2 million yuan, and a year-end bonus based on one and a half months would require 400,000 yuan. The union representatives also refused to concede. The talks over the past two days have yielded no results, as both sides remained firm in their positions. Furthermore, regarding (4) open finances, the authorities indicated that they could be open, but the union representatives were not satisfied with their so-called openness. The union believes that the separation of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau from the post office effectively absorbs the post office's cash, harming the post office's future. Therefore, the union's true intention in advocating for open postal finances is to merge the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau back into the post office. This issue was also a focal point of contention between the two sides. Yesterday afternoon, the talks broke down and the meeting adjourned without any resolution.</p>
<p>One: Denouncing the Bogus Beiping Central Enlarged Conference - No Legal Basis, Tracing the Collusion of Traitors Yan and Feng, and the Western Hills Faction's Reorganization into a Putrid Enlarged Conference in the Style of the Chau An Society. There is absolutely no legal basis. Is the so-called Central Enlarged Conference based on any particular Central Committee? Were there more members of the First and Second Central Committees in Nanjing or Beiping? Are only these few traitors who have lost their qualifications and changed their allegiance entitled to speak? The reckless behavior of these remnants of warlords, communist bandits, and opportunistic, degenerate elements of the Western Hills Faction is simply a manifestation of a large counter-revolutionary group. There is no basis in the party charter, and in reality, it is destroying the party and disrupting the country. The words "Central Committee" cannot be established at all. What is this so-called enlargement?</p>
<p>Two: The Meeting's Situation Is Ridiculous. This farce is laughable. It is claimed that there are more than 30 people, but only 11 attended, and one person signed for three people. What value does this have? The very first gathering has formed such a self-deceiving situation. The peculiarities and ridiculousness of subsequent scenes are even more laughable. One can imagine the situation of this farce.</p>
<p>Three: Nothing More Than a Flash in the Pan. In reality, Yan and Feng have reached the end of their rope. They are in dire straits in terms of finance, military affairs, and politics. They are using the name of the Enlarged Conference to cover up the truth of their desperate situation. They simply have no regard for the party, so they are trying every means to destroy the party that Dr. Sun Yat-sen painstakingly built over decades. This crime is truly enough to destroy the party and disrupt the country. At the same time, it reflects that they are nearing their demise, and it is just a tragic flash in the pan.</p>
<p>Four: Compatriots Should Rise Up and Denounce the Absurdity and Ridiculousness of the Bogus Beiping Central Enlarged Conference. As described above, for the sake of the nation's interests, we cannot tolerate these rebellious traitors, Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, Wang Jingwei, and Zou Lu, who are destroying the party and disrupting the country. We should request the Central Government to recover Beiping and Tianjin as soon as possible and destroy their lair. At the same time, we should unite to denounce this absurd and ridiculous Bogus Beiping Central Enlarged Conference.</p>
<p>Five: Slogans and Placards: (1) The Beiping Enlarged Conference is a disguised Chau An Society. (2) The Beiping Enlarged Conference is a group promoting Yan and Feng. (3) The Beiping Enlarged Conference is a gathering of ugly characters. (4) Dissolve the illegal organizations of rebels. (6) Eliminate all shameless and unprincipled members of the rebel party. (7) Eliminate Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, who harm the country and endanger the people. (8) Arrest Wang Jingwei, the traitor who seeks glory through defection. (9) Support Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, who strives for the people. (10) Implement the Three Principles of the People. (11) Loyal comrades of the Kuomintang unite!</p>

<h3 id="e120">National Anti-Smuggling Conference Convened Yesterday <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>A Total of Twenty-Eight Representatives Attended</p>
<p>Salt Commissioner Zou Lin Gave a Speech on Behalf of Song</p>
<p>The National Anti-Smuggling Conference, organized by the Ministry of Finance, held its opening ceremony at the Xieqiao Anti-Smuggling Office at 2 p.m. yesterday. In addition to the representatives from various bureaus mentioned in yesterday's report, those who arrived temporarily included Hu Mingzao, head of the Anti-Smuggling Special Task Force stationed in Songjiang, Li Di, representative of the Northern Anhui Anti-Smuggling Bureau, and Huang Xiancheng, chief of the Secretariat Section and above of the Anti-Smuggling Office, totaling twenty-eight people. As Anti-Smuggling Commissioner Wen Yingxing was in Beijing and had not returned, Deputy Commissioner Ke Sen represented Chairman Song Ziwen and appointed Salt Commissioner Zou Lin to attend and give instructions. After the opening ceremony, the attendees performed the required rituals. First, the chairman delivered an opening speech, stating in part: "Today's Anti-Smuggling Conference is the first meeting convened since the establishment of this office. The purpose of the meeting is to rectify anti-smuggling efforts by gathering the wisdom and talents of many people to plan the rectification of anti-smuggling. This conference is extremely important for the future of anti-smuggling. Although the abuses in anti-smuggling are deeply ingrained, advocating for rectification is not something new. However, if we want to thoroughly eliminate them, it cannot be achieved overnight. If we do not get to the root of the problem, identify the crux of the matter, and apply systematic and planned remedies, then simply talking about rectification will be useless. Therefore, before convening this conference, we sent inspectors from this office to various bureaus to conduct thorough investigations to clarify the truth. We also ordered each bureau to examine the local situation, formulate plans for rectification, submit them for discussion, and organize a preparatory office for the Anti-Smuggling Conference to compile and review various proposals to ensure thoroughness. All these procedures are intended to ensure that the discussions at this conference are practical and not just empty talk. Since the establishment of this office, six months have passed. During these six months, the fundamental plans for rectifying anti-smuggling have been put into practice. I would like to report the following matters to everyone present: revising the regulations to unify authority, training special task forces to strengthen our forces, and establishing training schools to cultivate talent. There are many other things that are waiting to be implemented. Now, I am delighted that everyone has come to the meeting to share their usual experiences and knowledge to discuss and plan the way forward. I hope that everyone present will carefully study the proposals of this office and various bureaus, speak their minds, and ensure that they are properly implemented without hindrance so that anti-smuggling can make significant progress. This is what the chairman hopes for." Subsequently, Zou Lin delivered a speech on behalf of Minister Song Ziwen. Finally, refreshments were served and the meeting adjourned. Thereafter, a plenary session will be held every day from 2 p.m. onwards to discuss the issues. From the 4th to the 7th, a review meeting will be held every day from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. to review various proposals. The plenary session will close at 5 p.m. on the 8th.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Replied</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Relayed</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the silk industry stating that Chinese silk exports to Egypt were subject to higher tariffs due to the lack of a treaty. The Chamber of Commerce requested that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expedite the signing of a treaty to remedy the situation. After investigation, it was determined that the Joint Business Association had previously requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to expedite the signing of a treaty regarding the heavy tariffs on Chinese tobacco exports to Egypt. It has now been learned that an agreement has been signed and exchanged, covering all Chinese exports to Egypt. Chinese silk should not be a concern. The General Chamber of Commerce forwarded a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting clarification. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied with a telegram stating that the interim trade measures between China and Egypt specified all Chinese products, not just tobacco. A transcript of the exchanged documents was sent to the Chamber of Commerce, which then forwarded it to the silk industry for their information.</p>

<p>To Protest the Changsha Incident</p>
<p>It is rumored that after the Communist army occupied Changsha, the Japanese Consulate General there was also burned. After holding a cabinet meeting, the Japanese government instructed its acting envoy to China, Mamoru Shigemitsu, to protest to the Nationalist government. Shigemitsu received the instructions and left Shanghai for Beijing last night with Secretary Hayashi to protest to Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting. Although the Nanjing Incident between China and Japan has been resolved and compensation has been paid, the Changsha Incident, with Shigemitsu's trip to Beijing, has once again become a diplomatic issue.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Transportation Informed the Shipping Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association previously received a letter from its member, Zhengji Company, stating that Chinese ships chartered by the company were planning to load goods in Dalian and transport them to Japan, but were suddenly prohibited by the Japanese Maritime Bureau. This not only crippled the business of Chinese ships but also intentionally infringed upon Chinese sovereignty. The association requested the Ministry of Transportation to intervene with the Japanese government through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protect sovereignty. It was previously reported that the request was approved. It is now known that the association has subsequently received instructions from the Ministry of Transportation, stating that after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs consulted with the Japanese government, the Japanese embassy replied that the Maritime Bureau had not taken any prohibitive action. The association has informed Zhengji Company accordingly. The instructions from the Ministry of Transportation and the attached original reply are as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Transportation Instruction No. 2311: Order to Implement Matters. Regarding the case of Chinese ships being prohibited from loading goods in Dalian by the Japanese Maritime Bureau, this association has repeatedly telegraphed the matter and consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to intervene with the Japanese side. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has approved the consultation and notified the case. Now, we have received a reply stating that the Japanese embassy has replied that the Maritime Bureau has not taken any prohibitive action, etc. The original reply is hereby copied and issued to the association for notification. This order.</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Document to the Ministry of Transportation Regarding the Prior Consultation: Regarding the case of the Chinese ship of Yingkou Overseas Trading Company being prohibited from loading goods in Dalian by the Maritime Bureau, the matter was previously submitted to the Japanese ambassador for investigation and a preliminary reply was sent. Now, the Japanese embassy replied, stating that the Chinese ship was a steamer belonging to the Beiyang Fleet and was entrusted to Zhengji Company for operation. At that time, the ship had been chartered by a Japanese merchant in Dalian. The Japanese merchant inquired with the Dalian Maritime Bureau about the procedures for the Chinese ship to transport coal to Japan. The Maritime Bureau kindly explained. Afterwards, it is unknown why the ship did not load goods and left the port. In fact, no prohibitive measures were taken, etc. Please note accordingly.</p>

<p>The Changsha Wharf Was Burned. Due to the sudden incident in Changsha, all foreign merchants' Hunan-bound ships temporarily docked in Hankou and dared not proceed. Although the Communist Party has retreated, a certain shipping company in Shanghai received a telegram from Hankou yesterday stating that one of the wharves along the riverbank in Changsha had been affected by the fire set by the Communist bandits. The amount of damage is still unknown. The loading of passenger and cargo ships from Shanghai to Hunan is still suspended.</p>
<p>China Merchants Resumes Upper Yangtze Route. Since the implementation of the reorganization of China Merchants' Yangtze River shipping on July 1, progress has been gradually made. However, the incidents of leased ships and reduced schedules, followed by the assassination of Zhao Tieqiao, have greatly hampered business. The responsible person, Chief Li of the Business Section, is still striving to advance the original plan. From August 1, the Jiangjing, Jiangjing, Anjiang, Shunjiang, Xinjianguo, and Jianghua ships will be assigned to the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th regular routes on the Yangtze River. In addition, the Hanyi route to the upper Yangtze River, which has been suspended for many years, will be officially restored starting from August 1. An agreement has been reached with the Transportation Department of the General Office to dispatch the returned Jiangyu, Jiangda, and Jiangtian ships to Hankou, Shashi, Yuezhou, and Yichang to compete with foreign merchants' ships on the upper Yangtze River route in order to recover lost profits.</p>

<p>A Japanese ship drifted to Shanghai. The Sanyo Maru, a 4,360-ton ship of the Japanese Sanyo Steamship Company, loaded cargo in Hankou on July 27 and sailed to Qinhuangdao. When it reached the outer reaches of the Wusongkou, about 80 nautical miles from Shanghai, it encountered a strong wind. The engine and other machinery inside the ship were damaged by the wind and waves. The ship drifted on the sea for five days and nights. The shipowner telegraphed Japan for help. The company then sent the rescue ship Nasu Maru to tow it outside Wusong. It was originally intended to take it to Qinhuangdao to unload the cargo, but due to the difficulty of traveling due to the mechanical damage, it was towed to Shanghai. It has now arrived in Shanghai. The crew and sailors are all safe, but the machinery needs major repairs.</p>
<p>Sailor Fell into the Sea. The Daiyamaru, a river ship of the Japanese Postal Steamship Company, loaded cargo in Hankou on July 26 and sailed to Shanghai, and then exported to Yawata, Japan. Unexpectedly, the ship encountered a hurricane in the Yellow Sea. At that time, a sailor, a Japanese named Shen He Wufu, was working on the deck. Suddenly, a huge wave hit the sailor and knocked him into the sea. After stopping the ship, the crew sent a small sampan into the sea to rescue him in the raging waves, but there was no trace of him. It is presumed that he was swept away by the huge waves.</p>
<p>Guangli Has Not Been Towed Out. The China Merchants Bureau's Guangli ship ran aground on Glen Island in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Jiangyu went to tow it, but it was ineffective. It has not been rescued yet. The bureau has continued to send a tugboat to wait at the grounding site and will attempt to tow it again when the tide rises.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession previously stated that the Public Concession had reduced the extra tax by two li from July 1 this year, but the French Concession had not announced the cancellation of the temporary two-li tax that was increased at the same time as the Public Concession. The association had repeatedly requested the French Municipal Council to cancel the tax to show public trust. The French Municipal Council replied to the Ratepayers' Association on the 30th of last month, agreeing to reduce the tax by one li first to comply with public opinion. The reply is translated as follows: (The following is a translation)</p>
<p>French Concession Municipal Council Official Letter No. 1570: Dear Sirs, The Municipal Committee of this Bureau has carefully considered the wishes expressed by your association on behalf of the Chinese ratepayers of the French Concession. On the other hand, it must also take into account the financial arrangements of this Bureau. Therefore, at the meeting held yesterday, it was resolved to reduce the housing tax by one li. This housing tax will be reduced to 13% from July 1 this year. The great talents of the members of your association have been fully revealed in several conversations, and the superintendent is deeply impressed that you have now achieved the above-mentioned resolution. A copy of the announcement of this Bureau that will be published in the newspapers (see the advertisement column of this newspaper) is enclosed for your review. As for the other items mentioned in your letter of July 23, they are currently being reviewed by our Consul General. Sincerely, Municipal Superintendent of the French Concession, Fan Erde, July 30.</p>
<p>Public Notice of the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession: Public Notice to the Chinese Ratepayers of the French Concession. Regarding the reduction of one li from July 1, those who have already paid can return to the Tax Office of the Municipal Council with their tax tickets to claim a refund, etc. It can be seen that the Municipal Council is trying its best to maintain its credibility within the constraints of the budget. Based on this fact, it can be inferred that the Municipal Council will not include the remaining one li of extra tax in next year's budget. In addition, the issue of increasing the number of Chinese directors is still being discussed. A further announcement will be made once a decision is made. Special Notice. Shanghai French Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association, July 31, Republic of China 19.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Replied to the Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry Association's Letter</p>
<p>The Shanghai Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry Association received a reply from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "In response to your letter proposing three measures to save the declining business, we have already telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Zhejiang Provincial Government today regarding the third item, the overlapping taxes in Zhejiang Province, due to the urgent deadline.

Yan, the county magistrate, instructed the county finance bureau to reply. The reply stated that the winter grain tax was about to end and was related to national revenue, so it was difficult to approve. The district head, Wu, has been instructed by the county government to instruct the township heads to separately investigate the damaged farmland, create a register, and report it to the county for submission to the provincial government for consideration during the autumn inspection.</p>

<p>It has been found that all the 五洲[Five Continents], 固本[Fixed Foundation], 新愛[New Love], 華鼎[Hua Ding], 豐立[Feng Li], 大亨[Great Success], 公茂[Gong Mao], 華昌[Hua Chang], 永和[Yong He], 南陽[Nan Yang], and 新昌[Xin Chang] soap factories had been approved to pay tax in accordance with the regulations for machine-made foreign-style goods and should not be taxed repeatedly. Other factories without established cases are difficult to handle in the same way. In addition to instructing the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance and the Jiangxi Provincial Special Commissioner of Finance to comply separately, we are notifying you by telegram. The telegram stated that the ten soap factories had previously been approved to pay taxes in accordance with the regulations for machine-made foreign-style goods and should not be taxed repeatedly. Other factories without established cases are difficult to handle in the same way. In addition to instructing the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance and the Jiangxi Provincial Special Commissioner of Finance to comply separately, we are notifying you by telegram. The association immediately forwarded this to the ten soap factories for compliance. Now, Qixin Soap Factory states that after receiving the letter, a batch of soap was transported to Zhejiang, but the people in the tax bureau stated that they had not yet received instructions and still required the payment of tax before allowing the goods to pass. The Ministry of Finance's telegram was issued on the micro date, which was quite a while ago, and it has not yet been forwarded. In recent times, personnel handling tax matters often use the excuse that the order has not arrived to delay the process and still collect taxes, so although the government has good intentions to sympathize with domestically produced goods, merchants have not yet enjoyed the actual benefit of tax exemption. The association hereby earnestly requests that your department review and verify the matter and strictly order your subordinates to immediately implement the Ministry of Finance's order, without making excuses or delaying, so that the state's policy of sympathizing with merchants' difficulties can be effectively implemented.

<h3 id="e135">Municipal Government Approves the Cancellation of the Road Maintenance Donation Collected Concurrently with the Military Industrial Road <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau stated that all transfer taxes and municipal administrative expenses collected concurrently with the issuance of contract papers are now unified in name and number as part of the unified revenue and expenditure of the municipal treasury. All scattered and miscellaneous donations collected according to old precedents have been cancelled. According to the precedent along the military industrial road, for every 100 yuan of contract price for construction and sale, a road maintenance donation of 5 yuan must be collected concurrently with the payment of the transfer tax to be used for the repair of the road. Now that other municipal roads have no special donations, the land along the military industrial road should not be treated differently. Therefore, the bureau submitted a request to the municipal government to approve the cancellation of the donation. It is reported that the municipal government has approved the cancellation of the collection from the 19th year.</p>

<p>The First Step to Remedy the High Gold and Low Silver Situation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent letters to various trade associations, stating that the Chamber had previously noted the significant losses suffered by importers due to the impact of high gold and low silver prices. It proposed to remedy this by settling prices on a case-by-case basis from now on. After consulting with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, it received a reply from the latter, acknowledging the thoughtful nature of the suggestions. The Chamber of Commerce, in its fourth regular meeting, resolved to first collect order forms from various import businesses and then convene representatives from various trade associations to discuss concrete plans. A number of responsible committee members would be appointed during the meeting, and several legal and economic experts would be hired to conduct joint research. This special letter is to inform you that you are kindly requested to submit the order forms to the Chamber as soon as possible so that we can proceed step by step in accordance with the established procedures.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Municipal Finance Bureau Rectifies Lane House Tax <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Assessing Staff Should Pay Attention at All Times</p>
<p>Tang, the Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, investigated and found that in various lanes and alleys of the city, some households not operating in storefronts were mistakenly assessed at the residential tax rate. This is inconsistent with the tax collection rules, and therefore requires rectification. He issued an order to various tax collection offices on the 28th of last month, stating that Article 12 of the city's house tax collection rules stipulates that houses in a storefront style but not used for business should be taxed as residential properties, while houses not in a storefront style but used for business should be taxed as commercial properties. Since the tax rates for commercial and residential properties are different, a clear and detailed investigation should be conducted to ensure compliance with the regulations and fairness. Last year, the bureau sent staff to investigate rent and conduct spot checks. Many discrepancies were corrected, but recently, it was discovered that in various lanes and alleys of the city, some houses not in a storefront style but used for business were still being taxed as residential properties. Therefore, a thorough inspection is necessary to rectify this situation. Considering that the tax collectors collect taxes door-to-door, it should not be difficult to distinguish between commercial and residential properties. It is hereby ordered that each collection office instruct its staff to conduct thorough inspections during tax collection and make corrections at any time, without concealment or favoritism. In the future, if any discrepancies in tax amounts are found, the staff member in charge will be punished for negligence. This order shall be complied with, in addition to separate instructions. At the same time, the bureau's investigation division is ordered to conduct strict and thorough inspections at all times.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Suppression of Shaoxing Wine Trade Association <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, stating (the beginning omitted)... According to a report from the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Soy Sauce and Wine Dealers Association, members of the association, including Xinbao Kang and Tongyu, reported that on the 8th of this month, they shipped fifty-two jars of high-quality Suzhou-made Shaoxing wine to Shanghai, with taxes and public sale stamps properly affixed. When passing near Laozha Bridge, they were stopped by staff from the Shaoxing Wine Trade Association, who claimed that they had not joined the association and confiscated all fifty-two jars. They were forced to pay membership fees and monthly dues to the association. Ding Jinsheng, a key member of the association, arranged a meeting at a teahouse and extorted money from Xinbao Kang. Xinbao Kang had no choice but to agree to join the Shaoxing Wine Trade Association, and twenty-six of the confiscated jars were returned on the 11th. However, the remaining twenty-six jars belonging to Tongyu are still being withheld. The small dealers suffered losses for no reason and are unwilling to accept this. Therefore, they requested the Chamber to ask higher authorities to investigate whether the Shaoxing Wine Trade Association is legitimate and to severely investigate and punish them to ensure the safety of businesses. After reviewing the above points, we were shocked. Has the Shaoxing Wine Trade Association registered with your bureau and completed the procedures? If they are under your guidance, they should have proper discipline. How could they be so unruly? If they have not completed the aforementioned procedures, we request you to ask the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Public Security Bureau to close down the Shaoxing Wine Trade Association and confiscate their assets to uphold the regulations of trade associations. A merchant group is using the name of an association to detain goods and extort money in teahouses. This is an extremely unlawful act, and many members of the association have suffered. If they are not severely punished, it will not appease public anger. Please ask the Bureau of Social Affairs to investigate the instigator and punish them severely as a warning. We have instructed the department to investigate and found that the so-called Shaoxing Wine Trade Association was not legally registered or reorganized when the Business Reorganization Committee handled the registration and reorganization of various associations inside the Dadongmen area of the city. Therefore, it cannot be considered established. They are forcibly recruiting members, confiscating goods, and extorting money. Without strict suppression, it is impossible to maintain discipline among the trade. Therefore, we have prepared a document to request your approval for a thorough investigation and legal action for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs.</p>

<p>A Mr. Song Arrested in Yingchunfang</p>
<p>The Whereabouts of the Kidnapped Child Are Still Unknown</p>
<p>Chen, a four-year-old boy from Huzhou living at No. 2, Shihua Lane, Huanghe Road, French Concession, was kidnapped on the 20th of last month without a trace. At that time, because the child only had his grandmother and was the heir to several families, the family did not report to the police or announce the matter to the public in order to avoid the danger of the kidnappers killing the child. Unexpectedly, the kidnappers repeatedly sent letters demanding a ransom of 150,000 yuan. The first contact required a prepaid negotiation fee of 3,000 yuan. The child's family only has a widowed grandmother. Although the child's father once opened a foreign goods store and jewelry business across from the Grand Theatre in Japan, he actually had no savings. The kidnappers' demands were excessive and could not be met. The kidnappers sent another letter a few days ago instructing the family to send someone to a certain place in the Public Concession on August 1st (yesterday) to meet the kidnappers with four biscuit tins. The police detectives learned of this and immediately disguised themselves as hawkers and followed the person making contact. By the time they reached the destination, it was 8:30 PM. Three people approached the person to talk. The detectives rushed forward and arrested all three people. They were taken to the police station for interrogation. According to their confession, the mastermind of the case is a Mr. Gu from Yancheng, who is hiding at No. 309, Yingchunfang, Hubei Road. It was already 9:45 PM when the detectives, along with one of the arrested, went to the Gu residence and arrested a Mr. Song in the north wing of the house downstairs. He was taken to the Laozha Police Station. He was a very tall man, wearing a Western suit, about forty years old, with a small mustache. He claimed that he was currently working in a certain organization and had been living there for over a month. He claimed that the matter was a false accusation by his enemies. The police chief ordered his detention. Two more people were arrested one after another, but as of 1:00 AM this morning, the whereabouts of the kidnapped child were still unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Three Men and Women Attempt Suicide in the Huangpu River, All Rescued <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Su Xin, courtesy name Boying, from Hangzhou, has been unemployed for a long time.</p>
<p>He is 36 years old and a graduate of Yuxiu Middle School. He is skilled in small calligraphy and has a solid foundation in learning. He has served as a clerk in the Zhejiang Provincial Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau, the Zhejiang Industrial Hall, the Hang County Government Office, and the West Lake Exposition. When the exposition closed last year, Su also lost his job. He came to Shanghai in May to find a suitable position and temporarily lived with his brother-in-law, Wang Hanliang, in Hualong Lane, Hualong Road, French Concession. After two or three months, he could not find a suitable opportunity, so he pawned his clothes and spent his savings. He was looked down upon by others and had no face to stay at his brother-in-law's house. He recalled that his parents had passed away, and his wife had also died. He was alone and unlucky in Shanghai, so he had the idea of ending his life. At around 7:00 PM the night before, he went to the Xinkang Wharf on Hankou Road and boarded the No. 4 ferry. When the ferry reached the middle of the river, he jumped into the river when people were not paying attention. Fortunately, the old captain Zhang Ah'er was quick and bravely rescued him, preventing him from drowning. He was sent to the water police station, and the police chief ordered him to be helped after learning the details. In a moment of anger, a middle-aged woman suddenly jumped into the Huangpu River at the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau at around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The body sank and then floated up again. Fortunately, She Jincai, an inspector from the bureau, was patrolling the riverbank in a boat and immediately rescued her when he saw her. Because she had swallowed too much water, she was unconscious. Artificial respiration was used to gradually revive her. The water police station sent police to take her to the police station and ordered Detective Huang Songsheng to send her to Renji Hospital for diagnosis to ensure that she was not in danger before returning to the police station. According to her confession, she is surnamed Lu, named Li, 35 years old, from Hubei, and lives at No. 11, a certain lane, Route du Père Froc, French Concession. Her husband's name is Lu Shaoqing, who is a general manager. He has been unemployed for more than three months. She has two daughters. The eldest daughter, Yu Zhen, is 17 years old and married Zhou Genbao, who runs a fruit stall on Route du Père Froc, in February last year. The younger daughter, Meizhen, is not yet engaged. Today, her husband's older brother (uncle) came to visit. Because she was feeling unwell, she asked Meizhen to cook rice, but it was not to her liking, which angered her husband, who scolded her and her daughter. In a moment of anger, she was willing to die. The police chief ordered the detective to inform her family to come to the police station to claim Li.</p>

<p>middle-aged woman wearing a coarse rice-colored linen shirt, solid-colored foreign yarn trousers, gold hoop earrings, and a hair bun hired a ferry from Jiangtian Wharf on the 16th pier to cross the Huangpu River. When the ferry approached the Bund of the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong Lannidu, the woman suddenly jumped into the river and committed suicide. Fortunately, the tide was rising at this time, and her body floated on the surface of the water. She was rescued by the boatman and sent to the police station of the Third District of the Public Security Bureau. According to the woman's confession, her name is Long Wang, 39 years old, from Nanjing. When asked about her detailed address and the reason for her suicide, she refused to tell the truth. After repeated questioning, she finally said that she lost her husband at the age of 32 and had no children. She then came to Shanghai and lived in her mother's house, that is, No. 15, Lane 49, Jiangbian Wharf, Gaochang Temple, making a living by sewing. She has an older brother named Wang Disheng, who works as a mechanic in the artillery factory there. She thought that life in this world was meaningless, so she embraced pessimism and jumped into the river to end her remaining life. The district chief checked the confession and planned to order her brother to come and claim her. The woman firmly refused, so he prepared a document in the afternoon and transferred her to the Public Security Bureau for disposal.</p>

<p>Including Many Box Cannon Pistols</p>
<p>Sun Shaokun, a Chinese detective of the Harbin Police Department, and the Western detective Parek were checking pedestrians in the Wuzhou Road area at around 1:00 AM yesterday when they saw two women in a rickshaw coming towards them. Their expressions were flustered. They ordered them to stop the car and searched them. They found a large number of military weapons around the waists of the two women, including five box cannons, five pistols, 605 rounds of ammunition, a pair of gold earrings, a gold ear pick, and a ten-yuan bill. They were taken to the police station. One woman's name was Chen Zhu, from Qingjiang, and the other's name was Wang Zhang, from Siyang. The police chief ordered them to be transferred to the women's prison for detention pending interrogation by the Special District Court.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special City Public Security Bureau detectives reported to the French Concession Police Department a few days ago that the Wuxi County Government had sent a document stating that a key Communist Party member, He Wenbing, had recently come to Shanghai and was hiding at No. 6, Tiancheng Lane, Jiaziyi Road, requesting a proposal for interrogation. The police chief approved the request and immediately ordered detectives to cooperate and go to the address to arrest He and bring him to the police station. Yesterday, he was transferred to the French Court for questioning. The visiting detectives explained the situation and requested permission to extradite him back to Wuxi for interrogation. He confessed that he came to Shanghai in January and did not dare to engage in Communist Party activities. The plaintiffs' charges were without witnesses or evidence, so he requested dismissal. The visiting detectives claimed that the defendant was indeed a key Communist Party member and presented newspaper evidence for consideration. The Chinese and Western officials instructed the parties to submit evidence within 14 days for further interrogation. The defendant was remanded.</p>

<p>Deng Zhonghe, the young owner of the Daqing Cloth Shop on Ningbo Road, British Concession, was kidnapped by kidnappers on April 3 last year in front of the shop. Detectives from the Huizi Police Department entered the kidnappers' den and rescued Deng. The accomplices Shi Aqing and Cai Dexing were arrested and punished by the court. However, Dong Xiaoting, a Tongzhou native who was also involved in the kidnapping, escaped and was wanted. At 8:00 PM the night before, Dong appeared at the intersection of Hankou Road and Yunnan Road. Yang Dechun, a detective from the Laozha Police Department, saw him and arrested him. Since the case was handled by the Huizi Police Department, Dong was sent to the original police station for detention that night. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi interrogated him. Li Zhishan, the police lawyer, stated that Dong was related to the case. According to the confessions of the previously arrested Shi and Cai, he requested his detention. The police still needed to investigate and requested a postponement. Dong confessed that the arrest of Shi and Cai was due to his informing the detective Liang Baosheng. They hated him very much and falsely accused him of being an accomplice during the court hearing. The court ordered the defendant to be remanded and adjourned the hearing for seven days.</p>

<p>According to the "North China Daily News," a correspondent from Guangzhou reported that four merchants from Xinhui who had escaped from a bandit den stated that there was a bandit den in the mountains where all the bandits were lepers who often kidnapped travelers and cooked human flesh. When the merchants passed by the mountains in a small boat, they were captured by the bandits and witnessed a 12-year-old boy on the same boat being slaughtered and eaten by the bandits. Because the bandits drank too much wine, they became extremely drunk and negligent. The merchants seized the opportunity to escape together and reported to the nearby army, which has now been suppressed and dispersed. It is rumored that the reason for eating people is to cure leprosy. Our country lacks adequate treatment for this disease, resulting in the tragedy of cannibalism, which is truly terrible.</p>

<p>Declared by the Local Court the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Zhu Muye from Hubei accused Zhang Binghui, Hu Baohua, and Zhou Maolin of falsifying documents at the Zhenfengtai Hotel. The Local Court interrogated them multiple times, finding that Zhu Muye's accusations were untrue and were a deliberate attempt to frame them. The accusations of falsifying documents and tearing up account books were checked by accountant Zhao Zuwei under the instructions of the court, and the accounts were proven to be accurate. The date for the announcement of the verdict was the day before yesterday. Judge Zhao opened the court and declared Zhang Binghui, Hu Baohua, and Zhou Maolin completely innocent and rebuked Zhu Muye for deliberately framing legitimate businessmen, which was extremely unlawful. According to an investigation by reporters, Zhang Binghui is the manager of the Yufengtai Hotel and is usually law-abiding. He jointly opened the Zhenfengtai Hotel last year. Zhu wanted Zhang to pay a small rent of 800 taels of silver. Zhang refused because the capital of the store was 2,000 yuan, of which Zhang contributed 1,500 yuan and Zhu contributed 500 yuan. Now, Zhu Muye accuses him of forging documents, but Zhang owns the majority of the shares. How could he falsify documents and harm himself? It is said that Zhu had a grudge against others and was secretly harmed, and was forced to eat feces. Zhu therefore misunderstood Zhang and others, resulting in a smelly lawsuit. In the end, he lost the case.</p>

They then searched his home and found a handgun in a charcoal basket in the stove. Both the person and the gun were taken back to the police station. Yesterday, they were handed over to the Special District Local Court. Judge Feng interrogated him. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that the defendant claimed in the police station that the handgun was deposited by a certain district chief and that further investigation was needed, requesting a postponement. He also presented the handgun and three useless checks as evidence. Xu, a staff member of Maosheng, then explained the incident. Dong denied being the owner of the store, claiming to be a shop assistant with a monthly salary of 20 yuan who had only been hired on July 10th. The store wanted him to pay a deposit of 50 yuan, so he resigned. He claimed that the handgun in his house was deposited by Mr. Liu, the former district chief of the Third District of Pudong, and that it was a rusted gun. Liu had already left to seek employment. He hired Lawyer Jiang Baoli to defend him. Judge Feng ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for further questioning.</p>
<p>○ Zhou Family Property Dispute Case: Deadline for Partition. Jinmei, the 21-year-old daughter of Zhou Zhou, a widow in the Zhou family in Yangshupu, recently became intimate with Kun Sheng, a member of the clan, and they appeared to be husband and wife. Her mother not only did not restrain them but also considered Kun Sheng as a future son-in-law. This angered Zhou Ziqi, the widow’s second uncle, and Zhou Fubao, the son of the deceased third uncle, who often argued with the Zhou Zhou mother and daughter, leading to separation and eventually fighting. The widow hired Lawyer E Sen to accuse Zhou Ziqi and his nephew of illegally detaining property and causing injury. The Special District Local Court had summoned them for questioning, as reported in this newspaper. The hearing continued yesterday morning, with the defendants also hiring Lawyer Ye Fukan for defense. The plaintiff stated that if the defendants could fairly distribute the family property, they would withdraw the case. Judge Cheng asked if the defendant did in fact have addictions because the plaintiff's complaint included statements about Ziqi not engaging in proper business, being addicted to opium, and being fond of gambling. The defendant vehemently denied it. The court advised them to divide the family property fairly to avoid prolonged litigation. Zhou Ziqi requested two months, but Judge Cheng believed that dividing the assets worth tens of thousands of yuan should not take that long, indicating an intention to delay. He set a deadline of seven days, which the defendant agreed to. Judge Cheng further instructed the plaintiff that if the property partition was completed, they should submit a written withdrawal of the lawsuit. The hearing was adjourned for seven days.</p>

<p>Bullet Enters Stone Crevice</p>
<p>Zhang Guifang, a patrol officer from the First Precinct of the Fourth District of Zhabei, was inspecting pedestrians alongside Officer Ye Shouchun near the railway overpass yesterday. He was holding a pistol loaded with live ammunition, with the safety off, while using the other hand to inspect the pedestrian. Unexpectedly, his finger touched the trigger, and with a "bang," a bullet was fired. Fortunately, the muzzle was pointing downwards, and the bullet entered a crack in the stone, avoiding a tragic incident. At that time, pedestrians were constantly passing by. Suddenly hearing the gunshot, they panicked and fled in all directions, causing a temporary disruption. After Officer Ye explained, the situation calmed down.</p>

<p>What Was the Purpose of Knocking on the Door Last Night?</p>
<p>Lu, a 24-year-old Shandong woman and wife of Li Wenli, residing at No. 7 Shenxiu Lane, Xuejia Pier, in the South City, is from Hangzhou and is known for her beautiful appearance and flirtatious nature. A few days ago, Li returned to his hometown for some business, leaving only Lu at home to watch the house. Every night when she went to bed, she heard knocking sounds outside the door, accompanied by a soft voice saying "Open the door." Lu, being timid, was terrified and suspected a ghost. The night before last, she invited her acquaintance Wang, nee Miao, to stay with her. Around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, as the two were sound asleep, they heard the same sound again. Lu got up and looked, and saw a person standing outside the door. She recognized him as Wang Qiaosan, a relative of Lu Aqi from Wuxi, who lived in the rear building. Suspecting him of improper intentions, she went outside and called Liu Xuehai, the security guard from the 25th post, who arrested Wang and took him to the First Sub-bureau of the First District. The bureau chief conducted a preliminary hearing. Lu recounted the incident. Wang, 23, from Changzhou, claimed that Lu was having improper affairs and attempted to shift blame. The bureau chief, finding the statements of both parties contradictory, decided to investigate the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e158">No Extortion of "Dry Foot Money" Allowed <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Public Notice from the Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus: Ships from the countryside arriving at the wharves along the Huangpu River are mainly used for transporting goods. However, upon arrival, porters swarm the ships, forcibly carrying goods regardless of the owner and extorting tips, which is extremely abhorrent. The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and Public Security Bureau have issued a notice stating that Xing Zhigang, a representative of ships from Pudong, reported that porters led by Xi Akun at the Nanhuiguan Wharf and Zhang Shunhe at the Wanyu Wharf to Yongsheng Wharf, would swarm the ships upon arrival, forcibly carry goods, and extort tips. Those who carried their own goods were also forced to pay "dry foot money" and "wharf money." If their demands were not met, they would detain the goods and act violently. The bureaus ordered the First Sub-bureau of the First District and the Water Patrol Team to investigate. The investigation confirmed that the porters were indeed demanding "dry foot money," forcibly obstructing transportation, and extorting labor fees. In addition to ordering the Water Patrol Team to work with the First Sub-bureau of the First District to bring the porters, as well as the plaintiff Xing Zhigang and witnesses Yang Guanlin and Zhou Jinwen, to the bureau for questioning as a warning, a joint public notice was issued to inform merchants and ship owners that if any porters were found extorting or causing disturbances, they should be immediately handed over to the Water Patrol Team or the relevant district sub-bureau to be transferred to the bureau for legal action.</p>

Around 7:00 PM the night before last, Sheng Changfu, again drunk, went to Liu Yongchang's copper and tin shop on Tongxing Road in Wusong to retrieve a teapot he had entrusted to the shop for repair during the day. The shop assistant handed over the repaired teapot and asked Sheng Changfu to pay 28 cents. Sheng Changfu claimed that he had bought the teapot from the shop, and now that it was broken, the shop was responsible for repairing it and guaranteeing its use for at least three years. He refused to pay for the repair as it had not been a year since the purchase. His tone was aggressive. The shop assistant, seeing that he was drunk and unreasonable, did not argue with him. At this time, Sheng Changfu's wife, Han, was also present and, seeing the situation, feared that her husband would cause trouble due to his drunkenness. She stepped forward to persuade him to go home. Unexpectedly, Sheng Changfu not only refused to listen but turned his anger on his wife, pushing Han with great force. She fell to the ground and died instantly. A crowd gathered. The patrol police arrived and arrested Sheng Changfu, taking him to the First Sub-bureau of the Seventh District for questioning.</p>

<p>Li Hua, a 40-year-old woman from Yangzhou, residing at No. 3529, Lane 2, South Yinghua Lane, Roberts Road, in the Shanghai West area, has a daughter named Longqiu, who is 16 years old. Both mother and daughter work at the Nei-Wai Cotton Mill No. 4, owned by a Japanese company. The daughter is clever and loved by her mother. Last winter, a matchmaker named Chen arranged for Longqiu to marry Gao Fengyuan, who lives at No. 53 Heming Lane, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei. After the betrothal, the mother stated that her daughter was still young and that the wedding should be held in two years. Unexpectedly, the groom suddenly wanted to choose an auspicious date for the wedding and repeatedly asked the matchmaker to persuade the mother, but the mother firmly refused, citing her earlier statement. Gao Fengyuan, the impatient fiancé, gathered four or five companions and two women around 7:00 PM the day before yesterday, hired car No. 1109 (licensed in the Concession), and parked near the lane of the bride's house. The two women entered the house and lured the bride, Longqiu, to the entrance of the lane. The group rushed into the car with the bride, who cried out loudly. The mother followed and called for the police, but the group had already escaped. Gao Fengyuan and the two women, along with the car, were arrested and taken to the Sixth District Police Station. District Chief Ren interrogated them. The plaintiff, Li Hua, 40, from Yangzhou, residing in South Yinghua Lane, recounted her daughter's betrothal and the kidnapping. Li Longqiu, 16, also testified.

He could not restrain himself and sneaked into Xiaomei's room, forcefully removing her trousers with the intention of raping her. Xiaomei woke up from her dream and cried out loudly. Zhang, realizing that things were not going well, staggered back to his room. Fortunately, she was not violated. Yu returned home the night before last, and Xiaomei immediately told her about the incident, stating that although she had not been raped, she was greatly frightened. Yu was furious and took Zhang to the Public Security Bureau of the Third District at 10:00 PM that evening. After investigating the details, the district chief deemed Zhang's intention to rape a virgin under the age of 20 extremely abhorrent. He ordered that the defendant be handed over to the Local Court for trial yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the Editor: Having read in today's news column of your esteemed newspaper that the Public Concession Police searched six stores and pharmacies selling aphrodisiacs, etc., including the manager of the Zhongxi Department Store on Haining Road, Zhou Zhangwu, I must point out that this is inconsistent with the facts. I work for the Jinghu Railway Bureau and only reside in the company's building. I have absolutely no relationship with the manager of that company. As this concerns false rumors, I have sent this letter to request a correction. Respectfully, Zhou Zhangwu. August 1.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Jiang Xiaojian's Letter to Various Institutions <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Statue of Dr. Sun Yat-sen at the North Railway Station</p>
<p>Concerning the matter of constructing a statue of Dr. Sun Yat-sen at the North Railway Station with donations from various sectors, more than a month has passed since the bidding process began, and no decision has been made regarding whose design to use or who should undertake the construction. The artist Mr. Jiang Xiaojian has some suggestions for the statue construction standing committee. Yesterday, he sent letters to five institutions, namely the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government, the Garrison Headquarters, the Two Roads Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce (the five standing committee members). The letter stated: "Regarding the preparatory committee for the construction of the statue by various sectors, the standing committee formed by the aforementioned five institutions is responsible for all aspects of the bidding and construction. Mr. Jiang Xiaojian believes that creating a statue is a unique art form, quite different from ordinary construction projects where drawings are prepared before bidding. Therefore, I have some doubts about the above method. However, due to the urgency of time, I only stated in the specifications that the stone base could be contracted to others, and the price for the stone base was not definitely confirmed. I believe that Dr. Sun Yat-sen is our founding father, illustrious for all ages. Now, constructing a statue in Shanghai concerns the view of both Chinese and foreigners, and it must be done with special care. The reason why I, Mr. Jiang Xiaojian, am willing to devote my skills to undertake this task is precisely for this reason. The bidding results have not yet been announced, but based on my personal experience, I deeply feel that there are several major errors that could lead to unfavorable outcomes. For example, for such a specialized art, from bidding to review, people with knowledge and expertise in this field must be appointed to ensure fairness and prudence. However, the representatives appointed by the various institutions are rashly taking charge of the matter, leading to significant errors in the bidding process. What are these errors? The failure to prohibit the listing of names on the drawings is one of them. It is unprecedented in bidding practice to allow names to be listed on the drawings. The failure to prohibit this has led to the reviewers knowing whose drawings belong to whom from the very beginning, causing external discussions and the inability of the reviewers to reach a consensus after months of deliberation. This is the first error. Secondly, none of the reviewers are art experts, so it is unclear what criteria they are using to judge. If the construction is carried out according to the drawings and cannot be applied, or if modifications are proposed but specialists cannot implement them, who will be responsible? Furthermore, Mr. Wang, a committee member from the Roads Bureau, even invited Mr. Jiang Xiaojian to the bureau in a private capacity to discuss modifying the drawings and the possibility of collaborating with another bidder, Mr. Zhang Chenbo, but did not invite Mr. Zhang to discuss the matter together in person. This attitude is also very perplexing. I hereby formally declare that the construction of the statue at the North Railway Station must be carried out in accordance with the following procedures to be appropriate: (1) It is extremely difficult to assess the merits of the art of statue construction based on flat drawings. Experts should carefully examine whether the design is in the Chinese style and investigate the artist's past achievements and reputation. (2) The main procedure for making the statue is to create a clay model. Therefore, it is particularly important to examine the artist's past achievements to see if they have artistic value and to investigate whether the equipment in their bronze casting workshop is suitable for statue making. The casting work cannot be done in ordinary sand casting workshops. (3) When reviewing the drawings, attention should be paid to the fact that the statue is the main element, and the stone base is secondary. If there are drawings for the stone base, any stonemason can build it, but the statue cannot be made by anyone who does not have extensive statue-making experience. Otherwise, it will lead to the inappropriateness of the secondary element overshadowing the main one. All of the above points are matters that should be handled. Perhaps all the previously submitted bids should be canceled and experts' designs should be solicited from home and abroad to ensure prudence. Because for such an important project, it is difficult to make a decision by only comparing two or three people. I have heard that the standing committee's review criteria are contrary to this. Although the review results are not yet known, the identities of the reviewers and the review methods already suggest that they cannot produce good results. Therefore, regardless of whether my designs are selected or rejected, I cannot agree and believe that I have the right to insist on the above points based on my artistic standing. Therefore, I dare to write this letter, requesting attention and hoping for a response."</p>

<p>Wife A: I think opening a store is an interesting thing. I really want to open a small grocery store and have fun. What do you want to open, Wife B?</p>
<p>Wife B: Every night, after my husband falls asleep, I open his wallet and secretly hide one or two banknotes. During the day, I open his letters to see if there are any love letters.</p>
<p>Husband: Our cook is working very hard today. This bowl of noodles tastes good.</p>
<p>Wife: This is what she made for the milkman. But this morning, they somehow had a quarrel, so this bowl of noodles is being enjoyed by you.</p>
<p>Mother: Child, the dormitory supervisor at school wrote a letter asking why you haven't been to school for three days. Go quickly.</p>
<p>Child: I really don't understand what they mean. There are already many children like me at school. Why do they insist that I go?</p>
<p>A: Old Bing's temper couldn't be stranger. He is usually comfortable and has no worries, but he insists on looking for trouble himself.</p>
<p>B: Then why doesn't he get married?</p>
<p>Husband: New clothes, new clothes, new clothes! You always pester me with this. Besides new clothes, don't you have any other thoughts?</p>
<p>Wife: I do, but I don't know if you're willing. I also want a pair of pearl earrings and a diamond ring.</p>
<h3 id="e177">A Short Stay at Moganshan (I), Jingbo <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Everyone knows that Qingdao, Mount Lu, Beidaihe, and Moganshan are all places where one can escape the summer heat, cleanse their minds, and avoid worldly customs. People in the south who fear the hardship of travel and want convenient transportation often go to Qingdao or Moganshan. In Qingdao, the Dalian steamer departs from Shanghai and arrives the next day. The sea breeze is pleasant, and the scenery is captivating, making it a delightful place. However, I believe that when we escape the summer heat, we should seek a spacious place, preferably with high mountains. Secondly, when living leisurely during the summer, we should seek tranquility. Although we don't necessarily need to be isolated from the world, we should try to stay away from the hustle and bustle, and the food and drink we need should be readily available. Other amenities, such as ball games and swimming facilities, should also be available. In general, should we not take a trip to Moganshan?</p>
<p>In the past, to climb the mountain from Shanghai, one had to depart early in the morning, transfer to a small boat at Gongchen Bridge, and arrive at Sanqiaopu in the evening. Then, one would change to a sedan chair to climb the mountain, and it would already be night. It took more than twelve hours. Although transportation was considered convenient, the day-long boat and car ride was exhausting. Since the completion of the highway, the journey from Hubin to Yucun at the foot of the mountain is over a hundred miles, and hiring a car only takes an hour and a half to reach directly. If you get off at the city station, it is even faster to take a car. In terms of time, it never takes more than eight hours from Shanghai to the top of the mountain. When the joint passenger ticket and transportation are completed in the future, transportation will become even more convenient, and the Ninghang Highway has also been tested. There will be endless scenery on Moganshan.</p>
<p>I went to Hangzhou this time, stayed overnight, and climbed the mountain early in the morning. At six o'clock, the car was already waiting at the door of the hotel, and the ride was very smooth. The lotus flowers in the lake were in full bloom, with green leaves and red skirts stretching as far as the eye could see. After passing Xiaoche Station, the speed of the car increased, and the beauty of the Zhejiang Province highway was especially admirable. The highway bureau has been operating for years, and the value is considerable. Opening up the wilderness and making a flat road is like grinding a whetstone, so there is no bumpy ride. Along the way, distant peaks stand tall, mountains surround and embrace, and lush forests and tall bamboos make the sound of water gurgling. The beauty of the scenery is hard to describe.</p>

<p>The site of the Hangzhou Municipal Government is the former ancestral hall of Yang Shandeh, the late Zhejiang Governor. After the National Revolutionary Army settled in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it was confiscated by the Zhejiang Provincial Government and allocated as the site of the Hangzhou Municipal Government.</p>
<h3 id="e179">The architecture of the ancestral hall is magnificent and elegant, needless to say <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The Giant Flies of Lanfeng, Yu Ying</p>
<p>It is said that at the beginning of this month, countless giant flies suddenly appeared in the sky over Lanfeng City. Their bodies were as large as bees, butterflies, and locusts. The local people were shocked and retreated in fear, afraid of being harmed by them. They dared not sleep in the open air even in the hot weather. It is said that there have never been such giant flies in Lanfeng before. Similar events have also occurred in neighboring counties, which is also strange.</p>
<p>When it was confiscated, the full dowry of Yang Shandeh's daughter-in-law was also inside. At the beginning of his term, former Mayor Zhou Xiangxian saw that the dowry was too good and was being moved and used by servants in the city, which would inevitably lead to damage. Therefore, he removed a room, sealed it, and preserved it. At that time, some government officials proposed to auction off the dowry and use the proceeds for charitable purposes or allocate them as start-up funds for a certain school as a memorial and to avoid decay. However, Zhou rejected all of these proposals. As a result, this beautiful dowry was temporarily unharmed and spared from being scattered among the people.</p>
<p>Some commentators said that Zhou's actions were unable to make use of waste and only maintained the name of preservation, which was not what a political economist should do. Others said that Zhou was able to think big and that the reason why he insisted on preserving it was to warn government officials against corruption, not to seek a few thousand taels of silver. This is exactly what a political economist should do.</p>
<p>Now, Cai Zengji has replaced Zhou as the head of the Hangzhou Municipal Government. I wonder if he has any plans for this dowry issue.</p>

<p>The police were extremely busy</p>
<p>The result was a great disappointment</p>
<p>According to a European dispatch this month, people all over Poland read a strange case in the morning newspaper: a package abandoned by passengers was found on a train from Wasaton to Lotz. When the police at the station opened it, they found fifty-two human ears inside, each carefully wrapped in cotton wool, indicating that the perpetrator was extremely careful with them. The ears seemed to be freshly cut, so the police initially reported that the incident occurred no more than a few hours before it was discovered. The matter spread far and wide, and everyone who knew about it was amazed. However, when the police investigated, they found that all the residents of Poland still had both ears and none were missing. Therefore, suspicions arose, and it was regarded as a strange case. Even after expert research, opinions differed, and no definite conclusion was reached. Before long, someone went to the police headquarters to request the return of the lost human ears. According to his proof, he was a dissection instructor, and the contents of the package were indeed the original items, but the ears were made of rubber and looked exactly like real ones. The cloud of suspicion was suddenly dispelled, making it a very interesting story.</p>

<p>I have longed for West Lake for ten years, and now my wish has finally come true. It cannot be said that I have no connection with the beauty of West Lake. Awakening from an early dream, the sunlight breaks through the window and enters. Pushing back the quilt, I look down and see green mountains and blue pools, all within reach. I don't know where the fragrance comes from, but I feel a refreshing fragrance that invigorates my spirit. The white clouds in front of my eyes sometimes rise and fall leisurely. Looking north, my parents' house is far away in Jimen. I recall the kind instructions when I returned south at the beginning of summer, which seem like yesterday. Now, I have abandoned myself and abruptly become eternally separated. Thinking of this, the warm face of a white-haired person appears in my eyes, looking at me with concern and reproach, and then smiling gently, comforting me as if with unbearable pity. Countless thoughts surge in my chest like wind-swept clouds. I desperately want to kneel before this warm-faced, white-haired person and plaintively express myself, but my throat is choked and I cannot utter a word. Hot tears fall on my clothes, and I don't know where they come from. After a while, I force myself to</p>

<p>(X)(6) The Scandal of the Philippine Athletes</p>
<p>The scandal of the Philippine athletes, which was once a sensation, has been recorded in the newspapers in Shanghai, but the details are not clear. The tabloids have added many unfounded words, calling it a "beauty trap" by the Japanese, which is far from the truth. The reporter saw and heard more accurate information in Japan, so I am recording it here. The Japan Youth Center, where the athletes of the three countries were staying together, is originally a club for young students. Usually, there are female students' figures. Since the opening of the conference, female students have come in groups of hundreds to admire the prestige of the Chinese and Philippine athletes. Therefore, the Youth Center was filled with a crowd of females, adding a lot of color. Since the tide of autographs, even more people came, with the majority of those surrounding the athletes being the women's army, accounting for seven or eight out of ten. Most of the Chinese and Philippine athletes do not know Japanese, and the female students only know a little English. The two sides gesture and laugh. The athletes are not all wood and stone, and they are also happy to socialize. The female students' psychology of worshiping sports heroes is even stronger than that of ordinary Japanese women, because they completely take physique as the goal of beauty. Therefore, the Philippine athletes were the first to be selected. Initially, many Chinese athletes also interacted with female students, but due to the strict management and the weakness of their physique, it was only a matter of ethics and there was no further love affair. From May 27th, the Philippine athletes and female students had a deeper understanding and advanced to the second stage of work. Every evening when the sun sets, pairs of Philippine athletes and female students can be seen walking under the trees around the Outer Garden of the Shrine, arm in arm and whispering to each other, and cafes are the only place for them to talk about love. On the evening of May 29th, it was completely mature and an international love affair occurred. Initially, the Japanese police, in view of the licentious behavior of the female students in recent days and the intimacy with the Philippine athletes, secretly ordered the Japanese police to pay special attention. Around 1:00 a.m. on the 29th, a Philippine athlete and a female student were discovered by the police in a secluded place in the woods near the track and field and taken into the police station. At the same time, more than a dozen Philippine athletes and Japanese women with improper behavior in the Outer Garden were also detained. Because it was an international matter, they were slightly condemned and released. The next day, the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun published the process of the love affair with a large headline, attacking the police station for failing to prevent it in advance and disrespecting the dignity of international competition. However, the Filipinos did not understand Japanese, so even though the city was full of news, they were still calm because they did not read newspapers, and their love continued as usual without being hit much. Therefore, on the evening of the same day, more than a dozen men and women were again inspected in the hotels and cafes near the shrine, and the Philippine delegation went to the police station to bail them out. The love affair was thus concluded. The Japanese police, under attack from public opinion, tried their best to investigate the facts. On the 30th, more than 60 female students were interrogated by the police. In addition, on February 2nd, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department summoned two students from a girls' school in Kujiki Ward, a 15-year-old, for detailed interrogation. It was heard that these two students, under the inducement of graduates, met three Philippine athletes staying at the Youth Center at the baseball field in the Outer Garden of the Shrine on the night of the 30th. Suppressing my grief, the waiter advanced my meal, so I called for wine and drank it alone. The wine entered my sorrowful heart, and the sorrow grew even stronger. I changed clothes and went to the lakeside, ordering a boat to linger in the middle of the stream as if sitting in heaven. The gentle breeze slightly dispelled my worries. Crossing the West Lake Bridge, I abandoned the boat and landed, walking and stopping until I reached the tomb of Master Manshu. I admired the Master's spirit across thousands of miles and paid my respects. Suddenly, I remembered the Master's poem, "Do not ask about life and death, just let the clouds and water flow, a lonely monk. Endlessly laughing wildly, endlessly crying, even if there is joy, it is already like ice." Thinking of the latter two lines is like a true portrait of me today, and my chronic illness is severe, and there is no way to escape Zen. The feeling of hidden pain is even more difficult to express. At times, the profuse flowers brush the wind, and pieces whirl and dance on my sleeves, seeming to love and pity my lonely figure, as if they can understand my words. I gathered all the fallen flowers and kissed them frequently, and then I regretted that the flowers may be unintentional, but I suddenly fell into a demonic obstacle. However, my nature is like this, and I am often teased without realizing it. Everyone calls me foolish and ignorant of the world. Alas, what is the world like, what is foolishness like? I truly know my own foolishness, but I cannot bear to hide my foolishness and pretend to be different from the world. As I walked and thought, I unknowingly reached Liu Zhuang for a short rest. I gently shook the oars and said to seek the Three Pools. Suddenly, the bell rang at sunset, and a dim smoke enveloped me. I suddenly felt like I was in Hua Xu, riding a dragon and carrying a cloud banner. The Qing Dynasty suddenly opened, and the Heavenly Emperor welcomed me. I stepped into the palace and saw that the walls were hung with curved jade and the room was brightly lit. The music master played the Dalu for me, and the beautiful women danced the rainbow dress for me. My eyes were dazzled and my spirit was confused. I was extremely happy and woke up. The tide crashed against each other, and the oars responded to each other. My mood was not happy. I looked up to the sky and sang loudly. The song said, "Xi He suddenly does not stay, stealing the world, where to seek? My body is weak, and death is not enough to atone for my sins. I look back at the vastness, why do I create resentment? (First verse) The profuse flowers drift in the wind, and all things grow sadly. Do not be sad about life and death. I delight in the stream and whistle. Who finishes the edge of the lake?"</p>

<p>Episode 13: Who Unintentionally Plants Blessings and Gains a Diamond Ring? This is the Fate, Deliberately Singing a Gold Thread Song</p>
<p>It turned out that the second prize that Zuo Shichen won today was a diamond ring, a pair of bracelet watches, two silver powder cases, and three gold buttons. Everyone heard that Zuo Shichen got a diamond ring, which can be regarded as a rare event. In fact, just saying the three words "diamond" has different sizes. The large ones are as big as a steel ball, worth hundreds of thousands of gold, or even millions of gold. Some come from deep palaces, and some come from private collections in mansions. The small ones, as fine as sand, are also diamonds and cannot be generalized. However, small diamonds are often only used as auxiliary products and cannot stand alone. A diamond that stands alone is called a "single stone" and naturally has its qualifications. The one that Zuo Shichen got is also a single stone ring. People were even more excited when they heard about it. In fact, although it is a single stone, it is quite small, but under the myriad lights like stars, it can also sparkle. No one knows which lady in the boudoir gave this universal garden tour's blessing ticket as a prize. No one knows on whose slender spring onion-like finger this ring was once worn, or what kind of legendary fact occurred on this ring. These small diamond rings are insignificant. If it is a large diamond in Shanghai, it is a demon in women's society. Often, a beautiful girl loses her chastity because of it. Often, a small family's daughter is so envious of this shiny little thing that she even falls to the point of drinking her hatred for life, or even dying of illness or committing suicide. It is simply commonplace and not worth mentioning. In fact, what is so great about wearing a ring on a finger and two diamonds dangling on the ears? Does it have infinite power to collect a vain heart? Those women with weak knowledge, even if it is a rare treasure, are not brought to life and not taken to death. Why fight for chastity and life? There are many such tragic events in Zuo Shichen's record. Now he also has a small one, which can be regarded as a microcosm. Looking at that pair of watches, you can think that this is the ancestor of the current popular watches. Originally, it suddenly became popular to wear the watch on the hand. There is a process of transformation, and this trace is the bracelet watch. Because the time watches have always been placed in the pocket, and to see the time, you take it out of the pocket. It can also be considered very convenient. But later, as European and American culture advanced, it became more and more troublesome to use hands. The time watch placed in the pocket must at least free up one hand to take out the watch, and sometimes both hands are used, such as opening airplanes, driving cars, and various machines. If you want to see what time it is and use one hand to take out the watch, it means that this one hand must temporarily stop efficiency. With a watch, the two hands can still work, and it can report to you what time it is on the wrist. This is how convenient it is.</p>

<p>Fluctuations Reach Seventeen Taels</p>
<p>The Ending Returns High Ten Taels</p>
<p>Ever-Changing, Ultimately Closing High: Yesterday, August 1st, the gold market showed its brilliance again, with the price rising back ten taels. However, at times there was a fleeting, rapid movement, ultimately reaching a high of seventeen taels, which can be considered significant. The storm rose again, and the changes were unpredictable. As for foreign exchange, it seemed to improve slightly. Banks maintained a steady attitude, with different deposits and withdrawals, and the listed prices did not move. However, the trading of notes by various firms was considered agile. Major players covered their short positions, including Yuan Mao Yong, Tong Tai Chang, Heng Xing, and hedging firms, all of which took in. Yuan Sheng, Shun Li, Fu Chang, Xie Yu, and others had already sold out. The opening was high due to the rise in exchange rates. Subsequently, it hovered around seventy taels. In the morning, it had reached within sixty-eight taels, and at noon, it rebounded to seventy-three or four taels. However, the psychology of the industry was divided, and there was inevitably some hesitation. Later, Shi Yuan Sheng, Fu Yu, Yan Yu, and others bravely resisted the shorts, while Yuan Mao Yong, Zhi Feng, Yong Shun Li, and others sold out, probably due to the rising exchange rate. People's confidence was greatly boosted, and the market suddenly became sharp, soaring straight up and breaking through the eighty-tael mark, reaching eighty-four taels and eight cents. Then, due to the instability of the situation, it suddenly fell by five or six taels. In the end, it was still at a high peak, with the price between eighty-three taels. The exchange rate improved slightly. Until yesterday, the large notes did not change, and the silver price increased slightly by one-eighth, and the US and Canada increased by one-sixteenth.</p>
<p>The opening rose immediately, then fluctuated. The opening price for September was 574 taels and 2 cents, an increase of 1 tael and 4 cents. The gross market fluctuated, falling from 4 taels and 7 cents to 69 taels and 8 cents, which was due to Yong Heng and others selling out. Then it rebounded by more than 1 tael. The internal trend was loose. The bank bought 6875 taels of British gold this month, and 81115 taels in October. In particular, Xiang Yu, Fu Chang, Tai Kang, Run, and others sold out, and the price fell by more than 2 taels. At 9:30, it was 67 taels and 7 cents. Afterwards, it rebounded, adding 23 taels. After 10 o'clock, it broke out of 70 taels. Heng Xing, Yu Da Yuan Xing Yong, and others competed to buy, and the exchange rate also rose steadily by 45 taels until 11 o'clock when it reached 75 taels and a half. After that, it advanced and retreated uncertainly, with a fluctuation of 2 taels. After 11:30, it fell to 2 taels and 78 cents, and the noon closing was 73 taels and 7 cents. The short positions were urgently covered, soaring ten taels. The market opened in the afternoon at 75 taels and 8 cents and immediately soared, because the exchange rate between Japan and the United States was higher than that in Shanghai. Moreover, Yuan Cheng, Yan Yu, Fu Yu, and other shorts were eager to enter, and the buying sentiment in the market was high, so the price gradually rose, soaring by 10 taels. After 3 o'clock, it reached 84 taels and 8 cents. In an instant, due to the situation, it suddenly fell by more than 5 taels, and at 3:10, it was 79 taels. In an instant, it broke through the 80-tael mark again, reaching 83 taels and 78 cents around 4 o'clock. At this time, Yong Feng and others chased after the purchase, and after a short time, it was repaired to 2 cents, leaving 1 tael and 67 cents. Then, the buyers did not slack off, and the market atmosphere was still good, so the closing price at 4:30 was 582 taels and 7 cents, an increase of 9 taels and 9 cents compared to the closing price the day before. The maximum price of the day was 84 taels and 8 cents, and the minimum price was 67 taels and 7 cents, a fluctuation of 17 taels and 1 cent.</p>
<p>The afternoon registration was delayed by half an hour. The listed price was still 642 taels and 6 cents, a reduction of 712 taels to 689 taels. The closing price for the afternoon was reduced to 678 taels after the 60 taels were registered. The morning registration was from 73 taels to 74 taels, and the afternoon registration was from 82 taels to 83 taels. The double settlement price was supplemented with 73 taels in the afternoon and 82 taels for registration. The registration is carried out daily according to regulations in the morning and closing market until 4:00 p.m. Now the regulations have been changed. The morning is as before, and the afternoon has been changed to 4:30. It has been implemented since yesterday (August 1st). The opening price for the goods was 74 taels and 3 cents, the noon closing was 3 taels and 8 cents, and the afternoon closing was 5 taels and 7 cents, with a closing price of 83 taels and 5 cents.</p>
<p>The trading was busy, with the Guangdong banks buying more and selling less. The trading of various firms included Heng Xing Yi Feng Yong Rui Kang Chun Yuan Yong Sheng Da Heng Chang Yong, all of which bought. Da De Cheng Shun Li Yuan Cheng Yi Yu Sen Chang Yong Xiang Yu Yong Heng Fu Chang, all of which sold. Yu Da Yuan Cheng Yong Zhi Feng Yong Yuan Mao Yong, etc., both bought and sold. In the afternoon, Fu Yu Yuan Cheng Xie Yu Heng Xing Jin An Yan Yu Yuan Da Yong Yong Feng Yi Feng Yong, all bought. Speculators covered their short positions. Da De Cheng Yuan Mao Yong Shun Li Cheng Feng Yong Zhi Feng Yong, etc., all sold. A total of 1700800 notes were sold in Dalian, while more than 700 notes were bought. The Guangdong banks bought more and sold less, about 2000 notes.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the exchange rates listed by HSBC remained unchanged. The overseas silver market was very quiet, and large transactions were inactive. However, domestic markets for British, American, and Japanese currencies seemed slightly tense. The market fluctuated slightly before and after, initially steady and firm in the morning, then weakening. It regained stability at noon and showed an upward trend in the afternoon, but not as drastic as the gold market. Gold prices fluctuated around seventy taels in the morning, but suddenly broke through the eighteen tael mark in the afternoon, making it a good opportunity for large players to cover their short positions, indicating a bullish outlook for foreign exchange. In terms of Chinese merchants, forward contracts for more than 100,000 pounds of British gold were concluded. Banks such as Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, Mackinnon Mackenzie, Anderson Meyer, Sumitomo Bank, and Banque Franco-Chinoise sold, while gold traders also sold tens of thousands of pounds to Banque Belge pour l'Etranger and Shanghai. Interbank trading was limited. For US dollars, banks only transacted tens of thousands of dollars, and Chinese merchants also sold a few tens of thousands of dollars, which were absorbed by American Express Bank. One million yen of Japanese gold was sold, which was taken up by Mitsui, Taiwan Bank, and Banque Belge. By the afternoon closing, compared to the previous day, British gold decreased by 0.0625, US dollars decreased by 0.125, while Japanese yen increased by 0.075, indicating a stable market sentiment at noon.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Interbank Loan Market Consistently Sluggish <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: The silver and money market situation seems to be sluggish at present. The day before yesterday, due to the month-end, various collections and settlements were relatively complicated and tedious. Yesterday, even though there were a few unsettled collections and settlements that needed to be completed, they were very minor. As for the interbank loan market, the market prices were generally the same, with no significant differences, and tended to be sluggish. It is unlikely that it will take off in the near future. However, it is possible that banks may purchase interbank loans on certain days, which may lead to an increase in interest rates.</p>
<p>Interbank Loan Prices (Foreign Interbank Loans): The morning price was 7 mace 2 fen 8 li 6 hao 2 hu ban, slightly higher by 1 hao 2 hu ban compared to the noon price the previous day. The noon price further improved by 1 hao 2 hu ban to 7 mace 2 fen 8 li 7 hao ban. The superficial situation seems excellent, but it cannot actually increase. (Silver Interbank Loans): Due to the unusual abundance of silver, the silver interbank loan market is difficult to become popular. Yesterday's morning and noon prices were both 2 fen, with no change from the previous day. Bank listings and additional water were all inactive.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Market Situation: Jiangnan small silver dollars have been rising for no reason in recent days, with a noticeable increase in the past few days.

<h3 id="e188">Securities and Bond Prices Continue to Decline <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market on the securities exchange was still sparse, with only 12,000 yuan traded throughout the day. The futures market was also less active than the previous day, with only 4.5 million yuan traded throughout the day. Internal customs and disbandment bonds accounted for 1.1 million yuan, reconstruction bonds for 890,000 yuan, and troop reduction bonds for 860,000 yuan. Although there were some other transactions, the trading volume was very small. The bond market environment was extremely sluggish, and market sentiment was weak. However, bond prices have already fallen significantly, and most people are taking a wait-and-see approach with no major transactions. Buyers are even more patiently waiting for opportunities and are unwilling to enter the market, so bond prices continue to decline without any sign of recovery. In the previous market, the customs and disbandment bonds had briefly risen, but later, due to sluggish buying sentiment, they were unable to sustain the upward trend and continued to fall together compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>The public's eye is watching to see if 60 taels can be achieved.</p>
<p>The yarn market is very firm and sales are brisk. Buyers have a strong bullish attitude and most are aiming to see a price of 60 taels. The current autumn season's spot sales are continuous and distant prices reaching 60 taels is also to be expected. However, each factory still has inventory, but coarse yarn is tighter. 16-count and 20-count yarn sales are increasingly slow. Japanese yarn inventory is drier due to more purchases from various gangs. The yarn market currently has this sales activity, of course, cannot be bearish and the pulling force of buyers is therefore stronger.</p>
<p>Renbiao Senkang Bought the Most: The Renbiao market opened in the morning with a calm market atmosphere. The second and third trades were tighter and prices of all months rose 1-3 qian. In the afternoon, the news that spot yarn sales were good and the market was even tighter. Sellers were relatively scarce and all prices rose 6-7-8 qian.

<p>American cotton trends are mediocre. The local cotton market is still firm because the new cotton season is still early and the weather is sometimes cloudy and sometimes sunny and there may be storms. Bullish companies see the environment in August as bad and spot sales are not moving. Distant months are being absorbed, so the new cotton market is slightly firm. However, the Japanese trading company Toyo Cotton Mill is shorting on the rise because American cotton is not good. At present, the reports from various villages are good and it is still difficult to predict. It is heard that Chen Yin cotton from the Shanghai Japanese yarn factory can be used until the end of the Gregorian calendar year, so spot cotton transactions have been hit hard.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, foreign rice sales were very good. Innerland and Yantai gangs had a few social transactions. With more transactions, the market was lively. In the afternoon, a new shipment of cheap foreign rice arrived, about 20,000 bags. Although the delivery of previously ordered goods was completed early, there was still a considerable amount of goods that were fixed at a cheap price. Therefore, people's hearts tended to decline. Local rice dealers' appetite was also weak. All rice prices returned to around a small jiao. The total market transaction volume was 2,000 bags of Saigon Grade 1 rice at 16 yuan 5 jiao 7 fen, 2,000 bags of small crushed rice at 14 yuan 9 jiao, 500 bags of red small crushed rice at 12 yuan 7 jiao, 3,000 bags of large crushed rice at 12 yuan 7 jiao, and 500 bags of Min Dang rice at 14 yuan 9 jiao.

<p>The rumors say that the Tianjin goods are being loaded.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the flour market was suddenly hit by a huge shock. The price of foreign wheat was reported to have fallen by 8-9 jiao to 1.34 yuan the day before. Yesterday, the report was that it had risen by 3-4 jiao. Furthermore, the delivery warehouse receipts for the upper months were not taken by the buyers, but were hoarded by powerful people. Foreign firm brokers also came to sell foreign flour, offering a price of 3.8 yuan. The environment was not good and sales were not moving. Therefore, people's hearts were very nervous. After the opening price, they fell wildly, especially the selling sentiment in the distant months, such as September to November, which fell by 2 liang 4 qian and a half. January was the first time it opened and fell to 2 liang 4 qian 5 fen 2 li and a half. It can be seen that the falling trend was very fierce. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, people's hearts were suddenly excited. There were rumors that the spot goods at the Tianjin port could be loaded, which made the Tianjin and Yingkou gangs suddenly eager for the near and distant months, and people's hearts were encouraged by it. Therefore, the opening price rebounded step by step. If this statement is true, then the later step can be temporarily seen as stable and firm. As a result, the current month was 0.075 better than the previous month, September was 0.05 better, October and November were unchanged, December was 0.025 better, and January was 0.012 better than the morning.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Forward Wheat Market Follows Flour Market to Rebound <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the forward wheat market showed an initial sluggishness followed by stability in the afternoon. At the beginning of the opening in the morning, the market was initially small for each month because the foreign wheat quotations were falling sharply, and it was once as small as 4 taels 7 qian 3 fen. However, it quickly recovered as the buying sentiment was good, and all months saw a rebound. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, people's hearts had become stable, and the trend was also stable and firm because the forward flour rebounded and there were rumors that the Tianjin gang had moved. As a result, August was 0.02 smaller than the previous month, September was 0.03 smaller, October was 0.01 smaller, November was unchanged, December was 0.01 better, and January initially opened at 4 taels 9 qian 2 fen and later was 0.02 better. Because the factory's appetite was weakening and the standards were unstable, spot wheat prices were smaller at all levels by 0.03-0.04, but the prices in the interior were not very low, and it is feared that the arrival of goods will become scarce. 5,000 bags of Chen wheat from Xuzhou, Taierzhuang, Yaowan, Tongzhou, Xinyang, and Hankou were opened and taken away by Fuxin.</p>

<p>New York Market: Due to the unusually hot weather this year, silk mills have uniformly stopped for summer vacation. Recently, the heat has risen again and the factories have not yet reopened. Raw silk consumption has decreased sharply. Imports of Chinese and Japanese raw silk have not been weak, and the inventory of silk has increased.

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market was sluggish because New York silk sales were not rising, French sales were also limited, and the opening prices were still low. Because Chinese silk merchants felt that the losses were too great, they were reluctant to sell. Yesterday, only Lianna and others bought 20 bales of Shanghai white factory silk, Dachang bought 20 bales of yellow factory silk, and Samsung bought 12 bales of yellow coarse silk at stable prices.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local firm tea market saw needle and eyebrow green tea from the incoming firm starting to be opened, and the firms of Yihua, Tianxiang, Yuansheng, and Fushi all started to operate. The market suddenly became lively. Du Dewei Foreign Firm of Gaozhuang Zhenmei also had a slight appetite, but the middle and low firm tea still had no major progress. The Russian firm Xiezhu Association and Baitouzhuang of Gongxi green tea continued to show strong interest, but the inventory was so thin that there was a shortage of supply. The Russian firm of Qining black tea has reported that the English firm sales appetite has been satisfied and has not yet opened. It seems that there is no activity at present.</p>

<p>The first batch of new orchids arrived in large quantities and the asking price was not more than 25 taels.

Therefore, over the past three years, the total savings amount in all branches has reached over one million yuan, demonstrating public trust. Now, to ensure depositors understand the stability of their deposits, the bank has completely separated the accounting of the savings department. All income and expenditure accounts of the department will be audited by accountants quarterly, and depositors are welcome to inspect the liquidation.

<p>Sanyou Industrial Society on Nanjing Road declares that because all of the company's products are necessary for new families, the business is thriving daily, and the store is extremely crowded with customers. The original location has been expanded repeatedly but is still insufficient. Recently, there is a property located between the Second and Third Sections of Nanjing Road and between Daxin Street and Shilu Road, accessible from all directions and located in the most prosperous commercial area of the special zone. The total value requires more than fifty thousand taels of silver. A commercial building of more than ten stories will be built. In the future, there will be a completely domestic product department store in this lively area, enough to rival foreign department stores.

As it is the hot season, the sales of various goods are quite smooth, and wholesale purchases from other places are particularly strong, with a tendency to not meet demand. Now, the fourth batch of new goods of various colors, including Wanzai Liuyang women's machine dororo ramie, etc., has been displayed in the window for customers to choose. There are only four days left in the discount period (ending on the 5th).</p>

All are extremely wonderful.</p>
<p>Caoye Society at 34 Ferren Road declares that the sales of the third volume, first issue, of the Innovation Magazine, published by the society on the 26th, have broken records. Vendors have only about fifty of the three thousand copies left, and the thousand copies distributed to various school gatehouses have also been successively replenished with increasing subscribers, adding more than seventy subscribers and thirty more society members. Therefore, the society is quickly publishing one thousand copies, correcting the misprint on the second page and the English letters on the sixth page.</p>
<p>Approximately on the 5th, it will be able to be published.</p>
<p>Guan Shengyuan Food Company declares that the company's latest product, the art bottle fruit syrup, has a novel and artistic style. Although the capacity is 50 taels of fruit syrup, it does not appear bulky in appearance. This bottle was newly shipped from the United States and was originally intended for storing hourglass water. Now, the company has reused it with a resilient switch cap, making it even more versatile. Each bottle sells for one yuan and twenty cents, and the retail departments, including the company's Nanjing Road head store, the Wangping Street intersection branch store, the Ji畝地 old store, and the Henan Road branch store, are all selling quite well.</p>

<p>Jinan Company declares that its twenty-first great production, the romantic and chivalrous giant film "Wind and Dust Swordsman" Episode 1, has a tortuous and delicate plot and is truly a superior work among domestic new films.
