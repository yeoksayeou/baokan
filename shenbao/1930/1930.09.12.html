<h3>萬人翹首看潮時</h3>
<p>— 劉恨我自杭寄</p>
<p>何處潮偏盛。錢塘無與儔。范仲淹詩也。浙江潮汛。傾動中外。八月十八。萬人爭賞。入秋以來。風雨肆威。海寗潮汛。奔驣澎湃。較之往歲又有過之。當茲潮令。邇日往觀者。已絡繹於途。預料屆時更有一番盛况也。</p>
<p>觀潮之地。一在海寗。一在錢江。杭垣士女。樓臺近水。多趨江干南星橋。在瀕江店肆間。或二凉亭三郎廟等處。但據該地人士云。民十以後。竟無巨潮。以慰衆望。不料今以海寗潮大關係。遂恢復疇昔舊觀。日間潮起時。銀山雪浪。浩蕩洶湧。入夜更風急怒吼。聲勢雷霆。倘於千夕月明。小集海月橋一帶倡家。買醉樓頭。憑欄遠眺。此情此景。飄飄欲仙矣。</p>
<p>夜潮旣勝於日間。然海寗小鎭。地僻人稀。東塘一帶。又無宿館。觀者泰半逡巡歸去。聞浙江省公路局有鑒於斯。除在杭海路特開觀潮專車。並在該處中山公園側。建築一大看臺。積極籌備。佈置就緖。更擬創設一觀潮旅館。以利喜觀夜潮者。一般游客。大可日以繼夜。一飽眼福耳。附錄本月潮來大小晝夜時刻表。藉作標準。潮汛最大爲初一十六日午末。夜子正。初二十七日未初。夜子末。初三十八日示正。夜丑初。初四十九日未末。夜丑末。初五二十日申正。夜寅初。潮汛略小爲初六二十一日寅末。夜申末、初七二十二日卯初。夜酉初。初八二十三日卯末。夜酉正。潮汛漸大爲初九二十四日辰初。夜酉末。初十二十五日辰末。夜戍正。十一二十六日已初。夜戍末。至十二二十七日已正。夜亥初。十三二十八日已末。夜亥正。十四二十九日午初。夜亥末則略小。以後潮汛又漸大。　爲十五三十日午正。夜子初。</p>
<p>中國旅行社例有觀潮團之籌備。今歲已勘定塲址。在海濱公園。至鎭海塘。座位可容五百餘人。聞以潮大。故日期亦已延長。前後凡九日。刻已刋發潮汛表。抄錄於下。以供海上觀潮者之參考。十月四日起。潮汛上午九時四十分。五日。十時半。六日。十一時一刻。七日。十二時。八日下午十二時四十分。九日。一時二十分。十日。二時。十一日。二時三刻。十二日。三時半云。</p>
<h3>江北匪禍中之慘劇</h3>
<p>— 程志政</p>
<p>江北匪氛之熾。愚及紅續君已於本刋一再言之。茲所記者。則爲匪亂聲中之慘劇。錄實本談。亦以使當道知江北民衆之日在水深火熱中耳。</p>
<p>二小時全鎭灰燼　通屬平潮區西鄉重鎭五接橋。毘連如境。匪衆屢謀進攻。卒以防預甚周。計不得逞。上月末。匪忽於午夜襲駐軍。聲勢甚大。駐軍應戰。而同時後方鎭市。忽來匪衆數千。縱火焚掠中有婦女幼童頗多。刦物悉由婦孺主持。隨以人力車載之北去。駐軍因被誘出苦戰。致後方不及兼顧。一時火光燭天。呼號之聲甚慘。約兩句鐘。全鎭悉成灰燼。嗣以援軍兼程趕至匪乃退却。</p>
<p>慘遭燻刑　該鎭副鄉長趙某。因倉皇出奔。爲匪槍殺。其子則爲匪綁去。施以燻刑。燻刑者。乃匪方酷刑之一。以人裸燻於烈火之上。及其將死。則又暫停。以俟其蘇直至無可玩弄而後始已。趙子慘遭毒手。誠可爲不幸者矣。</p>
<p>鄉長險遭不測　鄉長錢君鑑清。爲一勇敢有爲之青年。當匪勢逼近時。尙摇電告急。比出走已四面楚歌。乃改衣女子衣。伏田陌中。以荳葉略蔽體。戏一手握手槍。蓋如不幸爲匪發現時。即可躍出抵抗。不敵。立自戕。所以避遭毒刑也。匪先後過君身者凡三次。卒未撞破。殆匪遠去。始復出。然而渠之屋夏。百仞高堂。已盡成邱墟矣。</p>
<p>凌遲處死　匪之被俘者有三人。嗣即解鎭就地槍决。鎭人以若輩傾人家産非寢皮食肉不足以洩憤。乃削耳割鼻。即以其人之道。還治其人之身。人心爲之稍快、然匪勢未戢。禍亂難已、苦哉生民。不知何日能解此倒懸也。</p>

<p>予家於蘇州之金閶。某日因事往葑門外。僱人力車行。挽車者年齒尙穉。初索酬小銀元三枚。予昻之。憤然作色。曰。生性不喜較錙銖。先生願乘者良佳。如不欲者。亦不可强耳。察其儀態。殊非一般挽車之江北同志可比。乃笑頷之。途中叩其身世。乃云徐姓。今年方十九。且知書識字。家在離高郵城外一百二十里之某莊。家中除祖母及父母外。僅彼一人。所謂獨子也。有田三頃。足堪温飽。莊内居民。不下千户。懾於匪之時相侵擾。不安耕耨。乃醵金羅致一方外客。精少林術。拔矯健而奮勇之壯丁十三人。講藝習武。捍徫閭閻。徐尤敏慧。頗獲師之寵愛。盡得其傳。客歲。匪又來犯。徐率壯丁數十人。與菲格。匪敗而數匪殲焉。銜之甚。今歲夏。又大舉來攻。徐不能勝。遂被擄去。索贖一千五百金。家人無以應。匪嘗置徐於艙底。慘受刑毒。言時俯首腿際。刀痕斑然。確似新創。匪旋他徙。挾徐俱去。某夜俟守匪酣睡遁去。遄奔數十里。於翌日之晨光熹微中。馳抵常州。驚魂乃定。復循京滬路而南。晝乞食而宵乞宿。奔走十餘日。手足胼胝。輾轉至蘇州。邂逅一舊識在蘇業豆腐漿者。紹介於某人力車公司。而實行今之拉車生活。言時又頻視身臂等處。謂昔日肥白。今成焦炭矣。又謂每日自晨至午。須納車租小洋二角五分。血汗所得。除繳去車租外。不足千文。而彼一食。或須盡粟一升。斗米僅供其三日之耗耳。以目下米價論。將何以圖存。復憶及匪亂時。莊内居民。慘遭殺戮。屋舍爲墟。不知此後歲月。骨肉尙得團聚否。言畢不勝酸楚。淚涔涔下。而予之目的地已達。乃付値别去。心有所感。歸而誌之。</p>
<h3>南洋游記（四六）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>五月十號下午三時由星架波往檳榔嶼。同行者陳　佑嘉。原名義通和尙。坐英國Glang船啟行。二等艙二十元。此乃是一小輪船。一切招待均較法郵船三等爲不如。艙位室内亦窄狹。而三等四元八角。不知其相差何至四倍君也。佛敎會陳郭雨君送上船。乘一人掉之小船。余甚有戒心。而波平甚。余常思若一量以勞工爲中心而支配一切。則此等小船。孰使用之。在海中冒險求蠅頭之利乎、且若世界果廢錢幣制。則出門行李之搬運如何。將每行一步用警察命令人搬移乎。英名人H.　G.　Wells之新理想國。尙未主張廢除私有制。是一大問題也。大抵南洋勞工社會。較中國各碼頭爲安全。因此地以馬來土人爲主人。來此久者。自然受其質樸之感化。比國内碼頭社會之險惡爲優矣。若上海漢口各江關碼頭。危機四伏。我與友人身閱歷多次。往往遇見小綁票之舉動。雖有客棧招待。而尙時有意外。則不如南洋社會染馬來人古風者之安全也。馬來人道德高於吾人。猶蒙古人道德高於吾人也。此中大有學術問題。非研究過託爾斯太等學術。通達古今文化比較史者。一時未易明了。今於此不睱細述。吾乃久讀甚多之西籍新社會學。乃覺悟之耳。船。船内二等艙極少。滿船面盡華人。而馬來印度人亦少。愚意中華眞不愧大國。南洋各地都市。船面竟無異我大同鄉也。民族發達如此。雖有種種原因。殆因孔子重孝道。佛家主報恩。故人樂有子孫以繁衍至今日耳。據工人游歐洲者言。華人在各國者均不少。英倫亦有華人街。遠至澳大利亞。亦有華人。則民族主義眞一大問題矣。所惜語言不通。對面如外國人耳。如同爲粤人。而粤語數十種。則國語統一之宜汲汲也。</p>
<h3>東游通訊（十七）</h3>
<p>— 吳孝侯</p>
<p>乙社會敎育記者考察東京市政旣畢乃偕日華學會主事内田氏。並杜懹榮女士。赴東京市敎育局訪問。晤該局長藤吉利譽氏。談次渠謂本京市社會敎育。約可分公園。曁圖書館。並民衆敎育。三大類。並謂中日爲同文之國。渠極有志來華參觀。臨行並由杜女士爲該局長及記者合攝一影。爰就所答問之情形。及親歷東京市各公圍曁圖書館並民衆敎育處所參觀　之事實分項述之。　　　　東京市社會敎育之施設。至日大正十年後滕市長時。市敎育局。始有社會敎育專課之設置。迨至大正十二年。大震災後。市民思想進化。愛市之精社日濃。自治觀念。勃然而興社會敎育事業。遂日漸重要。迄記者赴東京考察之今茲。已燦然大備。雖不能與歐美並駕齊驅。然已可爲東亞各國之模　範。其突飛猛進之精神。固在在足以表見也。</p>
<p>（子）東京市公園之槪觀公園爲文化之樞紐。各國莫不視爲重要之設施。西人嘗言。都市如人身。公園若肺臟都市無公園。如人身無肺臟。其以公園爲社會敎育之要素也可知。即在吾華公園發達之制亦最早。粤稽古籍。如文王之囿。方七十里。靈台靈沼。與民偕樂。亦即公園制度之觴。特吾華於此種公共設施素乏整個統一之規劃。邇年外觀環境。内察時趨已漸知建設公園之重要。日本認公園市民生活及精神安慰唯一之處所。在明治二十三年時。初有公園計劃之發表。至三十六年。東京市規模最宏唯一之日比谷公園。始行設立。迨大正二年。市外井之頭公園。曁至十三年淺草公園等。遂相繼建設、雨後笋。勃發叢生。迄於今茲。有日比谷等大公園三十三所。全市小學校運動場隣接之小公園上六公園等五十一所。</p>
<p>日本小公園無甚可足述者。大公園爲日比谷。麹町。清水谷。虎之門。千島開淵。坂本町。千代田。數寄屋橋。芝。愛宕。乃木。白。江户川。湯島。宫本。淺草。今户。待乳山。深川。飛鳥山。井之頭。四谷。舊安田。町。大塚。下谷。綠町。土手。台塲。等三十三所。總面積爲二億一千四百三十九萬四千八百八十八平方米。就中面積最大者。爲下谷區之上野公園。有六千一百二十九萬五千九百三十一平方米。而規模之宏偉完備。則仍推麹町區之日比公園。其面積最小設備最簡者。爲四谷區之四谷公園。衹有十二萬一千九百四十二平方米之面積。</p>
<p>東京市各公園中。有號稱之四大公園。即（一）日比谷公園（二）芝公園。（三）淺草公園。（四井）之頭公園。</p>
<p>（一）日比谷公園。日比谷公園。。在麹町區西日比谷町及山下町地方。因宫城二重橋前之廣塲。與距濠南憑舊大名屋敷之跡。維新後。爲練兵塲。全園皆平坦地。仿中歐近代公園之格式。爲種種設備。開園日期。爲明治三十六年六月一日。誠市内唯一無二之大市街公園也。園之地基。爲南北長方形。備有六門。中央之正門朝東。曰日比谷門。當東北電車交叉之點有樂門。（舊爲日比谷游覽門）。北方濠端有櫻門。西面向霞開關有霞門。西南日比谷圖書館傍。有西幸門。向東南勸業銀行處、有幸門。鐵栅環繞之。園内道幅。。彎曲七間。（四丈二尺）。車馬通行。連逹各門。分四區焉。一入正門。配置舊水道之吸筒。並作小庭園之栽培。密要續包其三面。設音樂堂於高丘。上叚爲特别度。約容二千人。開演於陽春到我秋之際。奏瀏亮之妙音。令人聞之。如洗心焉。</p>

<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍無起色、緣歐美市塲白廠經銷滯價疲、僅川黃廠經電報稍有轉滬、計信孚等進鐵機等五十包、價仍平疲云、</p>
<h3>無鍚秋蠶發生變化</h3>
<p>因受天雨驟寒響無鍚各市鄉今歲農民秋蠶侗額不弱、惟因蠶種遲早關係、致蠶汛相懸半月左右、收蟻後天氣晴暢、蠶蟻發育　佳、詎邇來秋雨連綿、加以氣候寒冷、蠶蛾發生變化、殭斃與洩黃相繼發生、早蠶已上簇、晚蠶尚祗三眼開葉現狀不佳、豐收難望云、</p>
<h3>江浙秋蠶稅减半徵半</h3>
<p>財部批准不論出省留省一律免半徵半江浙兩屬秋蠶稅、去歲蘇省雖奉核准免稅、然祗限於運往通商口岸、若在内地繅絲者、則砃折完秋絲稅、待遇不匀、業經絲繭商一再電部呈求、已奉財政部批准、今屆江浙兩省所産秋蠶、不論出省留省、其繭稅均照各該原案規定數目、一律免半徵半以昭平匀、</p>
<h3>洋莊茶市暢滯不一</h3>
<p>近日婺源屯溪等路之高莊珍眉綠茶、錦隆永興同孚等行進意仍濃、售盤亦無變動、惟歙縣遂安等路珍眉、去路依然呆滯、祁寗紅茶、亦均無人問及、茶市大勢、已成强弩之末云、</p>
<h3>疋頭直貢緞上漲未已</h3>
<p>本廠棉布昨市仍漲落互見、細斜復漲、陽鹤藍雙魚又高二分半、現貨非常缺乏、實以抛空甚夥、加之邇來需要奇殷、故有隨出隨罊之勢、細布逐步下落、昨祗彩球因牛莊天津二帮去二百件、須六兩九錢二分半外、陽鶴祗售六兩八錢二分半矣、藍雙魚獵人亦莫不下落、粗布十一磅貨小二分半、十五磅四馬小五分、十六磅五鶴杭帮成交五十件、寗波長江等帮俱無巨大去胃、</p>
<p>東西疋頭市况趨勢尙挺、昨西貨之元芳呌莊又見上漲、放鯉延年直貢呢已售開二錢四分、故人心甚佳、惟東貨因上漲過烈、客家所售進賤價之貨、尚未走脫、兼之水浪　月華絨等已與定價接近、故昨日走銷驟呆、一度劇烈之漲風、頗有告一叚落之狀、昨惟直貢緞上漲未已、五路開三錢七分、八駿三錢六分半、天賜黃金三錢三分、第一功三錢一分、尙無現貨、鵲橋會飛馬童二錢八分半、較之又漲二厘半至五厘、實因存底缺乏之故耳、</p>
<h3>五金烟皮鐵搪磁廠旺辦</h3>
<p>五六百札烟皮鐵十八張花色、昨本埠搪磁廠辦去五六百札、價十兩零七錢半、而客路如天津青島諸帮亦多點綴、市面殊甚　觀、三六尺厚花色亦因本街火爐作亦多交易、帮趨勢亦甚擬硬、計售九兩二錢半云</p>

<h3>從一個事實談談中國的小學敎育</h3>
<p>— 溪濤</p>
<p>幾塲新雨洗出了日麗風凉的清秋、空中地上於不知不覺間浮出一種清秋爽朗的氣象、如果我們留心、在這秋光游戲的住宅區的光滑馬路上、可以看見些可愛的小弟妹挾着書包輕運他們靈捷的小腿悠然地向前向前、這將告訴我們新學期開始學校生活趣味、下大他的小心裏起着作用、校園中小同學游戲的圖畫一正在他的心眼之前展開呢、</p>
<p>這種的情景常常令我感動、早上在路上遇到上學的小學生迎面而來、你對他一笑時、他時常是報你以微笑、而且五步十步之後、他還會掉轉他的小臉來看你幾眼、這樣一來、便不由得你不停了脚步止送他消失在朝江裏、</p>
<p>如查有人要問起觀察一個國家或是民族的興廢的方法、我敢說、這一種表現在每日晨昏的路上的小學生上學的現象、必不失爲其中的一端、至於兒童敎育的好歹就更不用說了、如果這話有幾分道理、那末、在我們貴國就眞成問題、</p>
<p>中國的小學敎育似乎是向不大爲人所注意、就說以一間小小的小學爲範圍罷、其中可以提出指摘的問題不知多少、然而這些値得指摘的問題、却往往十九不爲關係者視爲間題、</p>
<p>晚凉天氣、與小弟妹閒話校中趣事、其中有現在我要談及的一椿、當我此刻伸紙落筆、叙述的時候、猶覺有無限的不快榮繞心頭、</p>
<p>妹妹說、（我們學校裏有一個同學偷）人家的東西、什麽自來筆呀、鉛筆呀、什麽課本呀、練習簿呀……什麽都偷、有一回、先生在校園的樹子上、看見掛着許多小包包、呌人取來看時、都包得好好的、每包的封面上都寫着『先生拿我的東』西是我的兒子、同學拿我的東西將烏龜、打開看時都是同學們失去的文具之類、行狂看了非當生氣、就把那同學縳起吊在那樹上、並將那些東西一包包掛在他的身上、讓同學們圍着觀看訕笑、後來通知他母親領回、告他不必再到校來、他母親是個寡婦、就祗生他一個、還有一個祖　母都是非常鍾愛他、平常穿的都是的西裝、還有零用錢、他母親知道、趕到校來、祗哀求先生打他、隨便怎樣處置都好、祗　望不要斥革他、先生怎麽也不答應、結果終於被開除了、那同學被革回家之後、同學們在路上遇着時都譏笑他、後來連别的學校的學生也知道了、也都一樣的恥笑他、他的母親送他到鼍别校去、别校也不肯收留、現在他的穿着委壞、人也難看多了、</p>
<p>『你們没有見過炝拿了偷的東西去自已用、或賣錢嗎、怎麽倒偷來包得好好的掛在樹上、』我問、『不、他有的是錢、好答、</p>
<p>在這簡直的問答中、我的心眼裏祗活現着一個頑皮活潑的少年、然想到他被吊在樹上爲全校同學所笑駡、以至於被開除、爲社會上識與不識的人所恥笑、以致於被斷絕了受敎育的機會、以至於失歡最親愛的母親與祖母、小小的年紀已成了社會上絕望的人、我又不禁爲之悚然替他姜惻了、</p>
<p>我不是心理學家、也不是敎育家、不敢確說上述的某少年的所爲是出於一種游戲的心理、或是佔有的衝動、或是一種竊盜的遺傳、以至於或是什麽不可救藥的惡根性……（有機會到想請敎那位高）明的先生、）不管他是民屬於任何一種、或是别的什麽心理上的變態、總之、自從他的那位賢明的師長將他吊起示衆、宣告永不錄取那時起、已彷彿没有研究的餘　地了、爲什麽、他不是給了他一個罪名！强盜！嗎、他已經是强盗了、師長用最科學？的、最奇妙的、最深刻的、不、最辣毒的方法顯示他是强盜、數百小同學衆口一詞的呌他强盜、附近的學生、以至於别的小學校的當事者通認識他是强盜、最親愛的母親也被外的壓迫視他爲强盜、即使他將來不會眞的做起强盜來、然『强盜』是决定的代替了他的本名了、</p>
<p>髣髴記得去年日本東京某女校發生過這樣一椿事情、一個女生（十五六歲罷、）偷了同學二十錢、後來在窗台上被發見、先生將她訓誡之後、扣留到傍晚乃通知其母帶她回去、翌日、此女生以投河自盡聞、其消息遍登各報、遂引起社會極大的非難、該校校長爲婦女運動大家某女士、曾因此發表楫懇切沉痛的自責的談話、蓋此事件所引起的問題、不簡單是一女生的死、而是敎育者的敎育方法敎育態度、與手敎者對於被敎者所負的責任、須知如某生自那時起所受的痛苦、實不减於自殺、即曰不然、而該敎員的敎育方法與態度、亦大成問題、</p>
<p>兒童是民族前途的盛衰的所繫、是人所週知的、小學敎育的重要已是用不着詞費的了、敎育行政機關對於敎員資格的審考、對於黨義師資之再三的嚴重的審考與培養、都告訴我們當局者是在注意學童敎育、然而對於兒童的本身的種種、譬如切合兒童身心發展的、兒童相性習癖的誘導矯正等形式以上的問題、在中國的小學裏所表現出完全被忽略了的事實、至少是使有子女的人們寒心的、</p>
<p>臨了、讓我們引一段柴霍甫關於小學敎員的話結束這篇短文罷、『說到敎師、必須是愛自已的天職的藝術家才行、然俄國之所謂敎師、簡直是没有受到什麽敎育的漂泊的老鴉、簡直像充軍流徒似的、村過村的敎育兒童、他挨飢、被殺、終日惴惴惟恐失掉當天的口糧、……村中的警察、有錢的商人、物師、學校何保護者、評議會員等、頂着視學官的頭銜、對於敎育的改良從不放在心上、……以敎育他人的人而僅給與咄嗟的薪水這是很可笑的、敎師穿着襤褸的衣、在潮濕的、風吹日曝的學校裏、顫寒氣、引風邪、三十左右就害喉頭炎、風濕、結核等症了、這是委難堪的、我們應該引以爲恥、　國的敎師、一年裏邊有八九個月是過善隠者一般的生活的、談一句話的對手也没有、朋</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>友、書藉、娱樂也没有、已使他漸漸變成愚眛、而且如果招待來訪的同事、這回更成政治的注意人物了！這是狡猾的人恐嚇傻瓜所用的語言、這是大家都惡心的事情、這是愚弄任着偉大的非常重要的工作的人呵……我每遇見所謂敎師的人都總替他們覺得可恥、因爲他的卑怯、因爲他的貧窮的服裝……我總覺得敎師的悲慘是我的不好似的、」</p>
<p>回顧我們的小學敎員拉黃包車、捕賣田鷄、糊售冥　、（都是申報發表的新聞）以至於用各種方法自殺的、時有所聞、這又呌我們又有什麽話好說呢、</p>
<h3>月夜</h3>
<p>— 光美</p>
<p>雖說是新秋天氣、赤帝着時代的轉變、潮流的趨使、無形中已减遞了若干嚴威、先前每日清晨時侯、血色的朝露、了也好外久未見着了、那曾盛極一時的鳴蟬的示威、已不知去向、一般青年男女也不像往日那般瘋狂也似地爭着游泳、逛公園或兜風了、門庭若市的游泳池、陡顯得凄凉寥落、公園當然不在例外、曾被人　詠過的江灣路上、也不若发地樣車不馬龍、有許多西裝少年架着機汽脚踏車背後搭着位窈窕而長髮的少女、在那平滑的柏油路學、風馳電摰地兜飛着了、這些這些、似都已變爲民國十九年的過去、可是、可是醉心自然的我、依然不忍遽别那一夏以來未嘗間隔一晚的呀口公園、</p>
<p>顯然是秋斩景象了、座登太半是空着的、不比往常要迫得去坐草地、池荷已失去了好那少女的芳芬和嬌艷、呵、好的青春消失在那裏、樹葉的萎黃、月下雖看不清晰、但却可以看出蔭影景不及那般濃郁、有時、、片片落葉、從身旁飄過、秋蟲喞喞地奏着天然的音樂、尤其是很容易辨别的蟋蟀、高唱着促織歌、『拆拆洗洗、早備寒衣、』一切都顯示給我們、—秋來了、</p>
<p>光聆阾的易逝、每每使人不堪回首、更不敢推測到將來、過去呵、童眞活潑的銷失、挽之不再、追之不得、未來嗎、更不忍設想、由少而壯、而老、呵、學業呢、成就呢、事業呢、所供獻於國家者是什麽呢、所告慰於雙親者是什麽呢、這些不知名的混合物、交集在心頭、怎禁得不担憂、憧憬、甚至悲哀、徬徨、但是、畢竟除了努力奮鬥、又將有何法、光阾終是不我待的呵、明天便又是開學的日期了、</p>
<p>姊姊、今晚是我們本學期最後遊公園的一天了、我雖還有幾天才開學、可是姊姊明天要上課了一弟弟怪甜靜地、！和月夜一般地甜靜、對我說、</p>
<p>『光陰過得太快了、簡直不容人慰留、』我好似抑怨的口吻、</p>
<p>今宵是滿月、照得大地一片白、天街如水、微風吹在身上、不寒而温、我們躺在這母愛的大自然的懐抱裏、似乎太幸福了、『怎麽一般人不知來享受、我暗自』</p>
<p>想着、</p>
<p>我們坐在樹的背後、月光從罅隙中透過來、斑駁成趣、弟弟調轉過頭來、『姊、您瞧、可愛的月姊伜儘偷窺、』</p>
<p>是的、可惜梅和素好們要用功、不然、人多些、才更有興趣哩、』</p>
<p>側面飄來陣陣鋼琴聲、唱歌聲、尖銳而宏亮的外國女人腔、我不知怎地會這榚意識着、這便日貝多芬在奏他自已的曲子、只可惜我們姊弟俩不能像月光奏明曲、裏面那史妹倆聞而下涙呵、我們對於音樂、根本是門外漢、但很愛好、不過、也僅屬盲目的崇拜而已、</p>
<p>『姊姊、您聴、可有什麽感想、太好聴了、不過、在這樣秋的月夜、却令人不勝悲呵、』</p>
<p>是呀、所以我最近十日來未寫過半篇文字、不敢下筆、動輒就要感傷、其實、我並不是悲觀的人、怎麽當這秋季、特别善於感傷呢、眞也莫明其妙、不過我的理智依然是克服着感情、决　不寫半篇悲傷的文字、露出弱者的態度、以致流入消極、悲觀、頽廢甚或浪漫的情態上去、不消說、這些這些、都是時代所不許、强盛而向上的國家和民族所不容的、而且、那種無病呻吟、我素來是反對的、即使講到在藝術上的價値、至多也不過是『爲藝術而藝術、』但是、藝術宫、象牙塔、都不容　我們再徘徊、盤醒桓了、我明知你和我平日是具着同一的意識、却不禁又說了、這些廢話、你問我作何感想麽、弟、别也吧了、可總是忘不掉爲我們終年辛勤着的母親、好老人家太愛我們了、爲了我們的求學、不知吃了若干辛苦、受了多少椰揄、最難堪的、就是不知聴了機何閑言雜語、意外的批評和誹議、唉惡劣的封建的社會環境、不知給母親以多少襲擊、飽嘗了難言和痛苦、不特精神方面呵、物質亦然、唉、我們將來不知怎樣地報答那偉大仁慈的母親、是以、我雖如此忙碌、但我却没有時一刻忘懹了母親、我每晨要暗自禱祝、禱祝母親的健康、還有、每當月夜中宵、月光直射到我床上、一覺醒了、本能地睜開那惺忪的睡眼、呵、光明的月、偉大仁慈的月、不是我們的母親嗎、好的愛、是廣義的、無私的、可是、月圓是很難見的、月缺最普遍了、若是我遇到這樣的情就景！月光僅剩着半邊殘骸、無力地發出些矇矓的微光、小星疏疏落落地圍繞着、浮雲不時地將好那衰老的殘驅遮掩、我便會這般意識着、月兒依然是母親、小星好比是我們姊妹、浮雲呢、是封建的殘解勢力、衰老的殘月、微弱的小星、可惡的荆棘般的浮雲呵、還要不時地好們明剌或襲擊、韶華不再、身體已殘廢了半邊的月兒、没有絲毫氣力、慘澹的光茫、好似衋盡量地掙扎着硬爬停窗紗者到床上、親愛的母親呵、好在勤勞的午夜、還得偷睱來瞧一瞧一好心愛的女兒、呌我息能不惹起心懷、勾起離悉呢、我忍不住心酸、涙流、字宙間的現象、那有比這再悽愴、哭吧、盡情地器吧、…可是呀、我不說『慰我有何人、我只恨慰月有何人、』如今呢、這種凄凉的月夜、落葉飄零、虫聲喞喞、我唯一的觸景生情、也便是想起了母親、……我黯然、弟弟則先我而涙流了、彼此沉默了一會、接着又談到大姊身上去、好是屈伏在老歸的腐化的家庭裏、一心想和那封建的惡勢力奮鬥、終於掙脫不出、最後、也惟有作肉摶的衝鋒呵、好的形骸雖存、好的精神已不知死去了若干成份、求學時代弱小而無能的我們、也是愛莫能助、唉、總之、我們的大姊、就這樣不知名的犧牲了、我們又轉了話頭、商量去爲較小的弟妹們訂書、這時、我們已立起來閑步着、</p>
<p>幽靜所江灣路上、人跡稀少、車馬渺然、明鏡般的月、照遍了平滑的地面、安步當車地閑話着、猛抬頭、已到了校門前的鐵道、『姊姊、當我搬往學校前、再來一』趟吧、』『好、再會、』一夏來、刻了板似的生活、就此也告了個段落、</p>

<p>社會消息</p>
<h3>訪問蕭伯納（二）</h3>
<p>— 霖</p>
<p>聲音的摹倣</p>
<p>現在蕭伯納在使我驚奇之前、沉靜了幾分鐘、伊摹倣伊自已在留聲機片中續漸加快的聲音、倘然他願意在大衆面前照樣重試一下、在游藝會的無台上、他必能賺進許我錢、</p>
<p>『是的』、他重復說、『留聲機所蓄的音呌人要露馬脚、有一次我問莫利愛有没有在留聲機片中蓄過音、他說、我那裏敢、我是十足的倫敦人呀、』</p>
<p>蕭伯納的意思是要我注意、一個人講說話要自然、不要在揚聲筒裏呌喊、</p>
<p>我說、『你自已的有聲電音不是十分的成功麽、』</p>
<p>『哦、我盡我的力量去做、』蕭伯納回答說、『多少由我自已動手、我把那關於莫沙』利尼的對話放進去、故意要呌他們不把這影片公衆前眏演、不過他們把這片子公映了、我也不去管他、我猜他們從這張影片上委得些利益、因爲没有隔上多少時候、又有兩輛大貨車、裝了攝製影片的家伙上我家裏來、他們請求我再製兩張有聲電片、每片代價八百鎊、但是找回絕了他們、』</p>
<p>『你曾經看過許多有聲影片麽、』</p>
<p>『我看過幾張、有一張動作和聲音都臻上乘、我說的是拉姆舍麥克唐納我做的、他是優越的、他的動作恰到好處、没有人能夠比得上他、除非葛拉特司東現在還在着、蕭伯納鄭重地說、『他也能做完美的有聲影片哩、』</p>
<p>我想蕭伯納的劇本初次攝成有聲影片時、這位戲劇家自已出馬帮助攝製、定無疑義、</p>
<p>我問、一你自製作蘋果車一劇麽、</p>
<p>『我加以干涉』萧伯納承認說、『我常常這』樣子、我胆敢說出品人不怕我的干涉、</p>
<p>另外一個題目、蕭伯納與我討論、是著作的實在方法、從著作人立塲而說的、我相信他的忠告對於熱望的作家很有用處、遠勝於函授大學所給的、可是爲免除幾個優越學校的惡感地起見、我必須申說、當蕭伯納將智慧之詞從頭上倒下來時、無論那個人没有機會去傾聽、這里所說的不過是他忠告的一段、没有多所引微、因爲我想讀者要自已去寫、（安諾德彭納脫常常告訴你、這是一個怎樣的困難生活呀、）因爲我又想這是爲忍耐而發光明燦爛的、早年的蕭伯納受到這忍耐的陶溶的、</p>
<p>現在我不歡喜我早年所寫的小說蕭伯納告訴我說、『因爲牠們引起我爲了寫小』說而受浩桎的想念、我爲了練習著作而寫小說、每天自定必須寫上幾頁、無論怎樣疲倦我必定要做完這件工作、有時候即使在一句句子中間停止、亦所不恤、我想、我寫好們祗爲寫而已、那時候我不知道、對於文體實在不必過於煩惱、如果那時候於文體作風上不是腮腮過慮、那末所作的小說、也許可以好些哩、</p>
<p>所以現在看起來、蕭氏於小說寫作的技巧早有根底、他說、『一個人第一須練習寫作、一等到你知道自已的職務後、你可以不必再有所顧慮了、總之、你所要做的、就是說你所要說的、而不必顧慮怎樣的說法、』</p>
<p>知道你的職務</p>
<p>倘然蕭伯要作一本戲劇、他能夠在最短時間中寫成、因爲他知道他自已的職務、他也希望别人都知道他們的職務、『有一次一個人拿了他所作的樂曲來看我、—『支葬福進行曲、』蕭伯納說、他對我說他化了九年的光陰、寫成這支曲』蕭伯納笑了笑、祇有蕭氏可以謔笑、他說、『我對伊話、倘然這個葬由要費去九年工夫寫成功、那末我不然望聽奏了、』</p>
<p>我曾對蕭伯納說、我所最引爲遺憾的、就是没有見到百得力坎柏爾夫人、在『第二坦桂萊夫人』劇中的表演、演戲的時候離吾未生前幾年、不過從蕭伯納本身、我想像起比了這個表演還要有興味、我現在還覺得最好没有錯過、這是蕭伯納在許多人摔滿的一間屋子裏、被已故女伶愛薩都拉鄧坎在榻上和他戀愛的一件事、我有一本書、是這無女死後所著的、我記得蕭伯納曾經有一次和伊一起吃飯、席上、困爲好吃肉、蕭伯納駡她食肉者、這意外的事是愛薩都拉告訴我的、現在看起來就是吃飯這件事也是錯誤的、</p>
<p>蕭伯納寫信給我說、『我生平從來後有和愛蕯都拉叙餐過、』</p>
<p>所以在我訪問他的時候、提起這件事、我的東道主告訴我一件很少人曉得而喜樂的事、就是他和著名女伶的一次僅有的會見、</p>
<h3>有趣統計十六年前物價比較</h3>
<p>— 雋山</p>
<p>祇電氣價値降低</p>
<p>世界經濟狀况、隨時更易、毫無常例、但物價之增進、則殆爲不可否認之事實、下表爲美國克里扶輪地方聨合信托公司、副理愛勒施密士氏Allard　Smitb所作、以一九一四年時之物價、與今比較、雖以美國爲背景、但大略固相雷同也、</p>
<p>以下爲今日價値一元之貨物、於十六年前之相當價格、</p>
<p>普通食物　六角七分</p>
<p>山芋　四角四分</p>
<p>牛肉　五角二分</p>
<p>麵包牛乳　六角四分</p>
<p>奶油　八角二分</p>
<p>鷄蛋　九角七分</p>
<p>衣服　六角二分</p>
<p>家具　五角二分</p>
<p>烟葉　八角四分</p>
<p>糖菒　五角九分</p>
<p>電　一元三角六分</p>
<p>可見各種貨物、均增高一倍或三分之二、祗電反减去四分之一、於此亦可稍覘現代明之影響焉、</p>
<h3>英國航業現狀平平</h3>
<p>— 雋山</p>
<p>英國航業、近數月來、似又較爲旺盛、但離恢復以前原狀之時期、尙不可謂其不遠也、若今日世界之情况能得改進、中國印度或俄國能得趨於固定、則英國航業必可大爲發逹、但按現狀而論、則加増船隻事宜、必極爲謹愼、俾不致供過於求、目下停駛之噸數已極可觀矣、</p>
<p>按倫敦航海協會登記處之報告、本年六月底前之一季内、建築中之商船計三百十一艘、總噸數一·三九二。○六三噸、此數係包括英吉利愛爾蘭兩島之船塢而論、便較之前一季、帔减少至二二三·九三○噸、較之上年同時、則減少六一·八四三噸、於今年六月三十日建築中之商船、全球共三·○五七·七三五噸、則此中幾有百分之四十五又半在英國建築矣、但按戰前而論、又當有遜色、一九一三年時、在英國建築之船隻、占至全球之百分之五十七、專家意見、則以爲英國於如此經濟狀况困迫之中、猶能有此成績、將來前途、極可樂觀也、</p>
<h3>德國將採用記錄電話</h3>
<p>— 雋山</p>
<p>德國郵務當局、正在考慮採用記錄電話Writing　Macbine之事、記錄電話爲新發明之機械、於受話者不在時、能自動記錄談話、且對用户並無經濟上之增加、故一般人咸希望其成功、</p>

<h3>League of Nations Representative of Italy Returns Home</h3>
<p>The International League of Nations had just convened when, unexpectedly, Mr. Grandi of Italy suddenly returned home. Consequently, various countries have made various speculations, all suggesting that there are disagreements between France and Italy. Italy firmly supports Germany on the Saar issue, but it would not return home for this issue. Although Italy does not express support for the European Federation, there is no urgent reason to return home given the result of this secret discussion. The issue that Italy is most concerned about is the problem of reducing naval forces. In terms of Italy's consistent attitude, Prime Minister Mussolini has repeatedly denounced peace as a hypocritical expression of mankind and encourages his people to fight opponents and expand their military in order to contend for hegemony. Therefore, his claims are fundamentally opposed to the peace policy advocated by the League of Nations. Even Mr. Grandi, the foreign minister attending this conference, has always strongly advocated that the navies of Italy and France should be equal. Recently, he has repeatedly made strong claims in his parliament, saying that equality is still insufficient to meet Italy's needs. Therefore, it can be said that his views are difficult to reconcile with France. After Mr. Grandi arrived at the conference, he observed the situation and saw little hope of reopening negotiations with France, so he left abruptly. This explanation is the most plausible. However, some French newspapers deny this, saying that Mr. Grandi's return home does not affect the negotiations between France and Italy. The Italian government does not want Mr. Grandi to negotiate with Briand at this time to hinder the progress of the conference. After the expert committees of both sides have discussed and come to a conclusion, Mr. Grandi will be instructed to contact Mr. Briand face to face. His words are indeed euphemistic, but what is the real reason for his return home? We will wait for its discovery and then discuss it further.</p>

<h3>Opening of the 11th League of Nations Assembly</h3>
<p>Representatives from 52 nations attended.</p>
<p>Romanian Ambassador to the UK Elected Chairman</p>
<p>Grandi Suddenly Leaves Geneva</p>
<p>Will Not Affect Italian-French Negotiations</p>
<p>Geneva, 10th (National Press Agency) - The League of Nations Assembly opened today. The Chairman delivered a speech summarizing past achievements and the agenda for this session, then adjourned temporarily to review the credentials of each representative. Upon reconvening, the assembly elected the chairman for this session. Out of 50 votes cast, the Romanian Ambassador to the UK, Titulescu, was elected with 46 votes. Representatives from 52 nations attended, including five prime ministers and eighteen foreign ministers. Unexpectedly, Foreign Minister Grandi returned to Rome this morning and did not attend. External sources say that Mr. Grandi's return to the country can be seen as another failure for the resumption of naval talks between Italy and France. No fewer than 400 representatives from the international press have come here.</p>
<p>Geneva, 10th (Pacific News Agency) - The League of Nations Assembly decided to form six committees to discuss various issues on the agenda. The committees convened this afternoon to elect chairmen as follows: First Committee (Legal Issues), Chairman Scialoja (Italy); Second Committee (Various Technical Organizations), Chairman Colijn (Netherlands); Third Committee, Chairman Politis (Greece); Fourth Committee (Financial Budget Issues), Chairman Carton de Wiart (Belgium); Fifth Committee (Social and Humanitarian Issues), Chairman Apponyi (Hungary); Sixth Committee (Political Issues), Chairman Borden (Canada).</p>
<p>Paris, 11th (National Press Agency) - Le Matin of Paris published a report from Geneva today denying that Foreign Minister Grandi's sudden departure from Geneva would affect negotiations between Italy and France. These negotiations are currently being handled by experts from both sides. Once there is a clear outline, Grandi and French Foreign Minister Briand will meet for further consultation. The Italian government does not advocate for the presence of the Foreign Minister during this stage of the talks to avoid confusing the public.</p>
<p>Geneva, 10th (National Press Agency) - Before Foreign Minister Grandi returned to his country, he had a long conversation with German Foreign Minister Curtius, discussing various issues concerning the two countries. It is reported that Curtius will continue to confer with Italian representative Scialoja (who succeeded Grandi as chief representative), and French Foreign Minister Briand will join them this evening to discuss the issue of the Saar region's legal status and the withdrawal of the protection troops under the League of Nations Secretariat. Geneva, 11th (Pacific News Agency) - Italian representative to the League of Nations Grandi suddenly returned to Rome at 6 PM yesterday. The sudden departure of the representative was considered unusual by people in the League of Nations. Parisian newspapers commented a lot on this move, and there were many speculations about the reason for it. It is claimed that the European Conference has made a decision on the federal plan, which makes it difficult for Italy. It is also possible that the internal political situation in Italy is one of the reasons for Grandi's return. Le Journal de Paris stated that the secret discussions on the Saar issue have begun. The Italian Foreign Minister was originally responsible for reporting on it, but his departure at this time raises concerns. Le Temps of Paris stated that British Foreign Minister Henderson announced the news when the Italian Foreign Minister happened to have already returned to his country. The declaration contained a section on naval relations between France and Italy. Grandi may have not wanted to deliver a tough speech to avoid disrupting matters. The London Daily Express reported that the representatives of France and Italy seemed to have agreed with each other two days ago, but the maximum limits for naval disarmament were of utmost importance, so the Foreign Minister returned home to consult Mussolini for his permission.</p>
<p>List of Indian Representatives Attending the Round Table Conference</p>
<p>Excluding the Extreme Nationalist Party</p>
<p>It Can Be Said to Be Inclusive</p>
<p>London, 10th (Reuters) - The list of representatives whom Viceroy Irwin has invited to attend the London Round Table Conference has been released. Some additional people may be invited later. Those currently invited are all influential and thoughtful figures in India.

<p>New Polish Prime Minister</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Arrest of Opposition Party</h3>
<p>No Prominent Leaders Were Spared</p>
<p>Pilsudski's High-Handed Tactics</p>
<p>Warsaw, 10th (National Press Agency) - Last night, Polish Prime Minister Pilsudski ordered the arrest of nine prominent leaders of the opposition party, including several leaders of the Socialist Party. The opposition parties had resolved to unite in the election campaign, so Pilsudski resorted to this all-encompassing plan.</p>
<p>It is also reported that among the opposition leaders arrested by Pilsudski are former Prime Minister Witos, Peasant Party leader Kernicki, and Socialist Party leaders Lieberman and Bartel. Arrests continued today, and the number of former members of the parliament detained in prisons has reached 22. It is rumored that Pilsudski wants to arrest as many as one hundred people. Former Speaker of the Parliament Daszynski may also be unlikely to escape this fate. Mr. Daszynski was about to go to Karlsbad for medical treatment, but his passport has been canceled.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the news of the Polish Prime Minister's arrest of the opposition party shocked the whole country. All opposition newspapers were confiscated today, and protesters marching in the streets were dispersed by the police. The arrested individuals were escorted by heavily armed troops to prisons in various provinces, and they will be charged with conspiracy to endanger national security. The opposition newspapers that were spared closure all claimed that the move was illegal because, according to Article 97 of the current constitution, only the prosecutor has the power to issue arrest warrants, but this time it was an internal order. The Polish Bar Association strongly protested to the Ministry of Justice today because several lawyers were arrested without warrants and for no reason.</p>
<p>Warsaw, 11th (National Press Agency) - The crackdown on the counter-revolutionaries and anti-government propaganda continues unabated. Arrests take place all night. The situation in the capital and major provincial capitals remains extremely tense. However, the disruptive power of the counter-revolutionaries is gradually expanding. General Pilsudski's anti-government objectives are likely to be achieved, and the upcoming elections may be severely affected. All counter-revolutionary newspapers have been closed down by the government. According to the government's observations, the strike wave may be eradicated soon. It is also learned that all arrested persons are now imprisoned in the Brest Fortress.</p>
<p>Japanese-U.S. Treaty Detailed Review Meeting</p>
<h3>Situation Suddenly Deteriorates</h3>
<p>Privy Council Decides to Suspend Review</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Telecommunication Agency) - Because of the demands for clarification of the supplementary plan and the surplus funds, the Privy Council's relationship with the government has completely deteriorated. It is difficult to expect a satisfactory continuation of the review after this. The Privy Council has decided to suspend the detailed review committee on the 12th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Telecommunication Agency) - The Privy Council's detailed review committee has now completely stalled and cannot continue its review. The government believes that the fault lies with the Privy Council and has decided to take strong measures, setting a deadline to urge a review. It is reported that the Privy Council will argue that the review materials are not ready and will decide that a review is not possible and report to the Emperor. One theory is that the Privy Council cannot report that a review is not possible at this time and should immediately decide whether or not to approve the treaty. Therefore, the Privy Council's formal meeting may attach a reasonable explanation and reject the treaty. The current situation is suddenly tense, and the situation is significant.</p>
<p>During the Election Campaign</p>
<h3>Germany's Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Still Following Stresemann's Legacy</p>
<p>Paris, 10th (National Press Agency) - A special correspondent of the Morning Post in Geneva reported after visiting German Foreign Minister Curtius that although there is turmoil in Germany due to the election campaign, the foreign policy will still follow the legacy of the late Foreign Minister Stresemann. The article stated that Germany is of course dissatisfied with the current situation in Europe, so it does not attempt to hide its desire for a peaceful revision of the treaty. On this point, the entire Germany is now united, and even the left-wing parties are propagating their demands in moderate language.</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia</p>
<h3>Also Has Anti-Italian Action</h3>
<p>Prague, 10th (National Press Agency) - The Italian Ambassador to Czechoslovakia protested to the Czech government because the local newspapers condemned Italy's execution of four Italian Slavic people in the Trieste region and requested to prevent similar attacks in the future. But the Czech Foreign Ministry rejected his request. Anti-Italian sentiment in Czech newspapers is also growing stronger. There are frequent demonstrations in the streets.</p>

<p>Except for Countries with Special Contracts</p>
<p>Ottawa, 10th (Reuters) - The Canadian Prime Minister stated in the Lower House today that Asians are generally prohibited from entering the country, except for those from countries with special contracts. This is one of the government's methods of dealing with unemployment. Canadian immigration officials previously had instructions that lawful workers and their families may be allowed to enter at their discretion. These instructions have now been revoked by cabinet order.</p>
<h3>Zeppelin Airship Visits Moscow</h3>
<p>Soviet Union Plans Far East Aviation</p>
<p>Moscow, 10th (National Press Agency) - The Graf Zeppelin airship departed from Friedrichshafen, Germany, yesterday to visit Moscow and arrived safely at the Khodynka Aerodrome here at around 9 AM this morning. When the airship entered Russian territory, it was at night. During the last leg of its journey, it was accompanied by several squadrons of military aircraft sent by the Russian government to welcome it. Before landing, it circled the Kremlin (the area where the Russian government is located) several times. Stalin looked up at the sky with great interest. The airship has now left Moscow at 5 PM this afternoon to return to Germany. A large crowd saw it off at the field. It is also reported that since the Zeppelin airship came to Russia, it is widely rumored that the Soviet Union plans to open a formal aviation line between Moscow and the Far East, using Zeppelin-style airships, because they can fly day and night without interruption, and the intermediate landings are convenient. Negotiations on this matter have already begun, and although the details of the progress are not yet known, it is said that there is hope of early realization.</p>

<p>Beijing, 11th (Pacific News Agency) - Le Soir reprinted a letter from President Hindenburg, which it stated was sent to various departments in 1918 but was never announced. It was recently extracted from a document. Its content advocates demarcating a 9,000 square kilometer piece of land between Poland and Prussia in eastern Germany and returning it from Polish hands to German colonists. The Poles cannot do anything about this event and will inevitably tend towards Germany in the hope of getting its assistance.</p>

<h3>Reflections on Visiting the Belgian Exhibition (Continued)</h3>
<p>Liege is known for its old industries, such as coal, lead, zinc, and other mines, and factories for military equipment and machinery. Recently, due to the depletion of mineral resources, the national economy will be affected. Therefore, emerging industries such as the rubber industry, the chemical industry, and the glass and porcelain industry are developing daily to replace them. It is noted that the total area of Belgium is only 11,750 square miles, less than one-third of the area of Zhejiang Province in China (Zhejiang area is 36,670 square miles). The people rely on it for their livelihood, similar to Britain, relying entirely on exporting products and importing food. Therefore, industry is the lifeblood of Belgium's national economy. The progress of industry depends entirely on in-depth scientific research so that costs can be low and prices can be cheap to compete with various countries in the world. Therefore, the University of Liège is known for its research in science and industry. This exhibition is particularly detailed in the exhibition of scientific education and vocational education, and there are academic conferences almost every day. When I first arrived in Belgium nine years ago, I was deeply surprised by the blindness of the Belgian political leaders. Why does such a small country need to establish its own universities, research institutes, libraries, and museums, and conduct all academic research independently in Belgium? Belgium has the most convenient transportation to Britain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. It is only seven hours from Brussels to London, only four hours to Paris and Amsterdam, and only ten hours to Berlin. Travel is convenient and costs are low. Why not imitate China's method of sending students to study abroad and use foreign universities to train domestic talents? After nine years of travel experience and reading the speech of the Belgian King in October of last year, I then know that Belgium's industrial products are able to compete in the world market precisely because academic research is conducted independently in the country. Unfortunately, the current understanding of the Republic of China is still the understanding of Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang in the tenth year of Tongzhi. They do not know to conduct independent research in the country and build a foundation, but only know to [select talented children to go to Western countries to learn skills]. No wonder our country with four hundred million people and four trillion square miles of land lags far behind Belgium with eight million people and 10,000 square miles of land in terms of industrial development and scientific progress. In 1905, China went to the Liège exhibition and displayed items that were nothing more than silk, tea, Fujian lacquerware, and Shu Lianji fans. Twenty-five years later, when we go to the Liège exhibition this year, although the displayed items have improved slightly, most of them remain the same. It can be seen that the progress of our country's industry is slow. People advance a thousand miles a day, but we only advance one inch a day. In this situation, even if another twenty-five years pass, the progress can be roughly seen. Can we compete with the world? All nationals should take responsibility and work hard, with a long-term vision, to implement rescue measures. This is what I want to encourage my countrymen.</p>
<p>Appendix: Speech by the King of Belgium: "Modern science opens up new horizons and makes technology more precise. Research in the laboratory becomes the industry of the future. Applied science cannot but rely on pure science, and a country's neglect of science and lack of scholars will inevitably lead to the decline of the country's national destiny." (The End)</p>

<h3>108th Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Committee</h3>
<p>The 108th Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Executive Committee was held at 8 AM on the 11th. Attendees included Hu Hanmin, Dai Fu, Xian Tan Yankai, Chen Guofu, and Sun Ke. Observers included Jiao Yitang, Gu Yingfen, Zhu Jiahua, Miao Peicheng, Ma Chaojun, Chen Yaoyuan, Chen Zhaoying, Wang Chonghui, Enhe Batu, Wang Zhengting, Shao Yuanchong, Wang Boqun, Chen Lifu, Zhu Peide, Zeng Yangfu, Kexing'e, Liu Luyin, and Li Wenfan.

<h3>Central Propaganda Department Receives the Press</h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department received the press at 2 PM on the 11th. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. The meeting was chaired by Secretary Zhang Tingxiu, who introduced Huang Jilu, the newly arrived party committee member from Guangdong Province, to report on the military and political situation in Guangdong. He said that Guangdong is the cradle of the revolution and has a very glorious history in the revolutionary process. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, although Guangdong became the rear, the strength exerted by the party, government, and military in Guangdong was particularly great whenever difficulties were encountered. Recently, Zhang and Gui's troops repeatedly invaded Guangdong, pushing to the outskirts of the city, but were defeated and pursued into Guangxi, completely eliminating the remnants of the enemy. The military and political authorities in Guangdong will also draw on elite troops to assist the Central Government, pacify the rebels, and complete the unification. In terms of politics, they are planning construction affairs during the period of political tutelage and will definitely create a model for China's construction in the future. In terms of party affairs, the reorganizationists worship Wang Jingwei as their leader, but Wang is the culprit in the Guangzhou massacre, and the people of Guangdong hate him to the core. Therefore, the reorganizationists will definitely not be able to move in Guangdong. The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<h3>Post-War Inspection of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Line (Continued)</h3>
<p>Regarding the War Scars around the Wen River: After leaving Yanzhou, the reporters and others arrived five li north of Yanzhou and saw a trench, which was for the Ma family army guarding Yanzhou city. Passing Qufu Station and arriving at Wucun, this was the starting point for the Central Army to break through the enemy. The Central Army's defense line was north of Wucun Station, outside the "Yang Flag". Further north was the Jin Army's defense line. Between Wucun and the South Station, both sides of the railway were guarded by hills, forming a figure-eight shape with Wucun Station. Therefore, the Jin Army's trenches were not at the South Station but south of Nantuo. There were a total of four Jin Army trenches there. The first was an infantry trench, the second was an infantry ditch, interspersed with machine gun emplacements, the third was an infantry trench, interspersed with artillery positions, and the fourth was purely for artillery positions. Behind each trench, there were communication trenches, densely crisscrossing. These four trenches all slanted southward from the east side of the railway line to reach the mountain recess on the east side. No trenches were seen on the west side, which proves that the Jin Army launched a southward attack from the east side of the railway, with one part besieging Qufu and the other flanking Yanzhou. After the defeat, they built these fortifications in an attempt to defend to the death. Unexpectedly, the Central Army again circled and outflanked them from the east side of the railway, cutting off their rear route to the Wen River. The Jin Army there was then attacked by the Central Front Army, and retreated hastily to the north. Therefore, many Jin Army vehicles were abandoned on the side of the railway. The vehicles were still marked with the words "Headquarters of the 11th Division of the Third Army Corps." There were also many abandoned mule carts and hand carts. Passing Nanyi to the Da Wenkou area, during the battle, there was heavy rain and flash floods. Now, the traces of the fields and soil being flooded are still visible. When the car passed the Xiao Wen River Bridge, it drove very slowly. The bridge had four large holes, and the damage was right in the middle. Because the water was shallow and easy to repair, sleepers were propped up vertically and horizontally at the broken parts. After passing the Xiao Wen River Bridge for dozens of steps, we arrived at the Da Wen River Bridge. The car stopped at the south end of the river bridge. The reporters and others got out of the car to inspect. The bridge spanned the Da Wen River and was forty-five meters long, with eight large holes and small holes at both ends. The damage was right in the middle of the fourth hole. The iron railings on the bridge were damaged on the outside. When it was bombed, the Wen River was in flood, but now the water is shallow and can be waded. The bombing was at the two piers under the bridge. Two piles of sleepers were stacked, with layers of empty spaces, covered with mud to maintain the stability of the stacked wood. However, the car still had to slow down especially when traveling. From the Xiao Wen River onwards, white powder wooden posts were erected on the side of the road, with the word "Slow" written in large characters to warn drivers to pay attention. Then, Team Leader Sun called the foreman Wang Rumei to talk to the reporters. Wang said that he had been working on this project for more than twenty years, and he had never seen such a huge bridge damaged. When the Jin Army retreated, they used a total of two hundred pounds of explosives to damage both the large and small Wen River bridges. Later, when repairing, they started transporting materials on August 8th. Because the water was rapid and difficult to repair, they started repairing on the 24th, and the work was completely completed at 4 pm on the 28th. They used more than 1,200 sleepers. Although this wood-supported bridge is temporary in nature, it can be said to be solid. However, it is most afraid of being hit by strong water. The water in this river comes from the Xintai Laiwu area. The autumn season of this year is about to pass, and the water level has receded. It is hoped that there will be no major problems. However, preventive measures must be taken next summer, etc. Then, we got back into the car and drove north. Looking down at the iron beams from the beams, some iron beams had also fallen off. The car traveled extremely slowly. Before long, we arrived at Da Wenkou Station. Sixteen Jin Army vehicles and two artillery pieces, all damaged, were parked on the platform. South of the platform, on the north bank of the Da Wen River, there was a Jin Army trench. Along the way, abandoned artillery locks, artillery shells, vehicles, clothing, and other military supplies were scattered all over the place. The Jin Army had deployed its front defense at Wucun and its rear defense here. Once the rear route was shaken, the front defense collapsed. After passing this point, there were no more defensive works, and they fled straight to Tai'an. According to local people, the east side of Wenkou was where the Central Army carried out its flanking attack. The Jin Army had deployed land mines, electric nets, and other items. The Central Army tied firecrackers to the tails of livestock, lit them, and scared them. The livestock were frightened and ran straight forward. The land mines exploded, and the Central Army took advantage of this from behind. The Jin Army's line of defense was broken. Then, the car continued north and arrived in Tai'an at 4 pm.

<h3>Shen Honglie Denies Participating in Northern Organization</h3>
<p>Telegraphing Jia and Xue to Inquire About the Truth: Northeast Navy Commander Shen Honglie recently saw reports that a government was being organized in Beijing, and there were suggestions to appoint him as the Minister of the Navy. Considering that this news was alarming, he telegraphed Jia Jingde and Xue Bi, asking them to inquire about the truth nearby in Peiping.</p>
<p>The original text of the telegram is as follows: [To the Peiping Garrison Headquarters, transferred to Mr. Jia Ruhuang and Mr. Xue Ziliang. In recent reports, my humble name has been mentioned for the position of Minister of the Navy, which is deeply frightening and strange. I have always held a military position in the Northeast. In addition to serving under orders, I have not participated in anything else. I personally received your esteemed advice in Beidaihe a few days ago, which is still in my memory, and you did not mention anything else. Now, there is suddenly such a rumor, and I dare not be sure whether it is true or not. You are in Peiping and should know the details. I respectfully request you to inquire and clarify my doubts. Awaiting your reply, your brother Shen Honglie (Fifth Day) Seal.]</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Forcibly Occupy Houses in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Huaming Company in this city owns a building on Zhongshan Road. The building has been constructed for more than 30 years and is already dilapidated. It is planned to rebuild it. The tenants are six Japanese companies, including Wutian Foreign Company, Chuanlang, Tsujiri, Maba, Yokota, and Kamiyama. The original lease contract has long expired. The company notified the tenants last summer, limiting them to move out before the end of the year. However, the Japanese merchants relied on their power and forcibly occupied the houses, ignoring the notice. The company had no choice but to request the authorities to negotiate with the Japanese Consulate, requesting them to order the Japanese residents to move out. The Japanese Consul knew that the fault was on their side, so he suggested mediation in order to delay the matter. Unexpectedly, the Japanese residents became even more aggressive and proposed six demands: (1) Renew the lease for three years as before, and move out when the term expires; (2) Slightly repair the houses, increase the rent, and continue to rent indefinitely; (3) Rebuild the houses according to their plans to suit the current situation; (4) The landlord should buy all the inventory of the Japanese residents; (5) Each household should receive a subsidy of 5,000 Japanese yen; (6) Find similar houses for them and the moving expenses should also be borne by the landlord. The Chinese authorities considered the Japanese merchants' demands to be too coercive and there was no room for mediation, so the municipal government refuted them based on reason. This matter has been delayed for more than a year and has not been resolved. Huaming Company has suffered heavy losses due to the rising prices of construction materials and labor. Recently, they sent letters to the tenants again, limiting them to move out by the end of August. On one hand, they petitioned the authorities to notify the Japanese Consul, deciding to start construction in early September. Now the deadline has passed, and the Japanese merchants are still ignoring it. This has aroused public anger among the citizens, who believe that the Japanese merchants are relying on the extraterritoriality as a shield and are being unreasonable. If they are allowed to forcibly occupy the houses, the property of the Chinese people will lose its guarantee in the future. In recent days, various organizations have gathered to discuss and decided to provide support to Huaming Company. On the one hand, they petitioned the municipal government to negotiate seriously with the Japanese Consul and limit the time to move out to protect sovereignty. The following is a copy of the letter submitted to the municipal government: "According to Huaming Company's letter, the situation of Japanese residents forcibly occupying houses is extremely infuriating. After a meeting, we all believed that Qingdao is entirely our country's territory, and the Japanese residents are so arrogant. If this continues, our country's property will be further unprotected, and the people's suffering will inevitably increase. Fortunately, your government has launched a serious protest and repeatedly refuted them based on reason, which has made people feel a little relieved. We urge your government to persevere and negotiate seriously until the final victory is achieved. We pledge to be your support, and we are looking forward to it." (September 8th)</p>
<h3>Liao Bridge Breach in the Upper Reaches of the Yellow River in Shandong</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Due to the rising water during the flood season, the Liao Bridge dike in Fan County on the north bank of the upper reaches of the Yellow River breached on August 6th. At first, the breach was only a few dozen feet wide. However, because the Jin Army was retreating at that time, traffic was blocked, and telegrams were cut off, the report of the breach did not reach Jinan until eight days later, on August 14th. This was just when the Jin Army was withdrawing from Jinan, and the situation was chaotic, and no one was responsible. After the Jin Army retreated, the provincial government moved to Jinan from Qingdao in September. Before they could catch their breath, news of the reorganization of the provincial government came, and the authorities had the mentality of "five-day magistrates" and did not pay attention to the river affairs at first. The River Affairs Bureau was helpless due to lack of funds. Furthermore, due to military relations, the jurisdiction over the north bank of the Yellow River did not belong to them, so they could only sit and watch the breach expand. The Jin River Affairs Bureau was far away in Dezhou and was not concerned about it. Moreover, the two armies on both sides of the Yellow River were constantly shelling each other across the river, and no one dared to work on the river. As of now, the breach has widened to 230 feet, and the levee has been breached. The water flows eastward from the breach, covering more than 30 li. It flows east through Shouzhang, Yanggu, Dongping, and Dong'a counties, and then re-enters the main river at Taochengbu. As a result, the villages and towns along the 200 li river have become a swamp. North of the people's dike is the Jin dike, which is the official embankment. Now, due to the impact of the water, dangerous sections have appeared. The Provincial River Affairs Bureau cannot reach the north bank due to lack of authority, so it can only telegraph the river workers in that section to negotiate with the local people, purchase materials on credit, and rush to reinforce the embankment. If the Jin dike breaches, the water will flow northward, and the terrain of Shandong is high in the south and low in the north. The water can directly reach Tianjin, and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line will become a swamp, and the disaster will be unspeakable. Recently, a dangerous section has also appeared at Qijiazui in Lijin County on the north bank of the lower reaches. Because it is on the north bank, they cannot reach it. They can only telegraph the chief of the lower reaches section (stationed in Qinghe Town on the north bank) to act as appropriate, negotiate with the local people and the troops stationed on the north bank to jointly rush to reinforce the embankment. However, in reality, it may not help. (September 8th)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Restaurants and Taverns Go on Strike</h3>
<p>Opposing the Donated Merchants Forcing the Use of the Joint Invoice System: Guangzhou Dispatch: Recently, the restaurants and taverns in Guangzhou went on strike to oppose the implementation of the joint invoice number system by the donated merchant, De'an Company, considering it difficult to implement. They once sent representatives to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Finance to abolish it. Recently, this case was discussed and decided by the provincial government, ordering the Finance Department to implement it on a trial basis according to the proposal. After receiving the order, the Finance Department announced its implementation yesterday (6th). The announcement stated that the joint invoice approved by the department is not much different from the joint invoices currently used by the city's restaurants, taverns, and boat shops. The managers of the restaurants, taverns, and boat shops were summoned to the department for an interview. They only stated that it was difficult to manage the workers and could not explain the difficulties of the joint invoice system. Moreover, the Nanjing dinner counting joint invoice has also been implemented, with numbering, stamping, binding into a book, and distributing it to various restaurants, taverns, and boat shops for application. If they still resist, their business licenses will be revoked and they will be ordered to cease business, etc. After receiving the order, the restaurants and taverns generally believed that the difficulties were: (1) The procedures are too cumbersome, and it is difficult for the accountants to handle them; (2) According to the regulations, those who evade taxes will be severely punished. If two joint invoices are used, one must be given to the customer, and it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no price increases in the invoice to frame them. Among these two points, the latter is especially dangerous. It is said that the joint invoice has been used in Nanjing for a long time, but in Nanjing, taxes are only levied on those over five yuan, and only five cents are added to each yuan. In Guangzhou, each yuan must be taxed 16.5 cents, and even those with two corners or more must be collected as donations. The difference in taxation between these two places is a sign that Guangzhou has a particularly heavy burden. Based on the above reasons, on the 5th, the Yiyitang Commercial Association of the restaurants and taverns held an emergency meeting. More than 300 restaurants and teahouses in the city each sent one representative to Yiyitang to participate in the conference, deciding that the restaurants and taverns would go on strike first, starting from the 6th, and telegraph the reasons for the strike to the whole country, waiting for the government to resolve it properly. On the 5th, they began to stop handling goods. On the morning of the 6th, more than 260 restaurants in the city closed their doors and stopped business. Each restaurant posted a sign at the door saying "Repairing the stoves, temporarily suspending business." On that day, the donation company sent people to distribute joint invoices for the shops to use, but all the shops closed their doors and refused. The donation company then reported the closed shops to the Finance Department for verification. It was found that the four major restaurants in the city and the hotels in Xiguan City had all closed their doors, and more than 20 Western restaurants had also joined the strike. Only the five flower banquets and restaurants in Chentang, including Jinghua, Yongchun, Yanchun, Liushang, and Binan, could not stop business at the same time due to procedural reasons. After the banquet merchants stopped business, they presented a report to the provincial government, stating the difficulties and drawbacks of the donation company forcing the use of the joint invoice system, requesting an order to revoke it, and sent telegrams to the central government, requesting maintenance to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants. After the restaurants and taverns went on strike, the merchants who originally had transactions with the line were affected, such as the fresh fish stalls, livestock stalls, pig and beef shops, seafood shops, and firewood and rice shops, which were indirectly disadvantaged. However, it is heard that the Finance Department does not seem to intend to revoke the joint invoice case. This turmoil may not be quelled in a short time. (September 7th)</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Express</h3>
<p>The salt tax of Liangzhe (Zhejiang) is now borrowed by the Ministry of Finance to repay a commercial loan of 2.46 million yuan. It will be allocated monthly from September of this year to May of the 20th year. The Zhejiang Audit Branch has been ordered to pre-fill the permits used by the merchants and distribute them for collection, also ending in May of the 20th year.</p>
<p>The estimated income from the salt tax of Liangzhe in the current month is 300,000 yuan for the regular tax and 200,000 yuan for the additional tax. However, the counties of Taishun and Pingyang in the Wen area are disturbed by the Min bandits, and the tax revenue of the area is inevitably short. The Salt Transport Department and the Audit Office have ordered the local bureaus to find ways to restore production and sales to maintain the national tax.</p>
<p>The banks in Hangzhou have been ordered to subscribe for the provincial construction bonds, and it has now been decided that they will jointly purchase 100,000 yuan of face value. The banking industry has also decided to jointly purchase 87,000 yuan of face value, and will pay the money soon.</p>
<p>Cheng Zhenjun, the director of the Construction Department, went abroad for inspection in March of this year and has now returned to China. He returned to Hangzhou from Shanghai by night train yesterday. It is heard that after resting for a few days, he will ask the provincial government for leave and go to the department to work.

<h3>Local Dispatch Songjiang</h3>
<p>Request for Investigation of Extortion Under False Pretenses: Recently, someone claiming to be a staff member of the Public Security Bureau, accompanied by someone in military uniform, went to Dongchan Temple and Dizang Nunnery outside the East Gate to claim that troops were about to be stationed in the temple, in order to extort money. As a result, Dizang Nunnery was swindled out of four yuan, while the monks of Dongchan Temple thought that they did not look like public officials, so they went to the Fourth Precinct to request an investigation. Wu, the town chief of the area, also expressed his intention to request a thorough investigation, as a warning to those who extort money under false pretenses.</p>
<p>Mount Zhongjia is About to be Lost: Jiufeng, the only scenic spot in Songjiang, has recently been requested by many people from the Shatian Bureau at high prices to prepare for quarrying.

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Refugees Claim to be Communists: The night before last, more than 100 refugees arrived at Qinpu Temple and Panlongpu, all carrying guns and claiming to be communists, disturbing the villagers, arbitrarily extorting money, and looting chickens, ducks, and other food.

<p>Trial of Child Rape Case Opens: Er Nv, the adopted daughter of Jiang Wenbing, a resident of Changchun Alley outside Xumen, is 11 years old. On the afternoon of April 25th of this year, around 7 pm, she was lured to the upper floor and raped by Shen Fengzhang (about 40 years old), who lived in the same house. The next day, Jiang's concubine, Jiang Xu, discovered it and reported it to Wang, the patrol officer of the Seventh Precinct of the former City Public Security Bureau. After receiving the report, Wang ordered a police officer to arrest Shen and transfer the case to the local court. After the trial, Shen Fengzhang was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for indecent assault. Shen refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the High Court. Yesterday (11th), Zhang Bingci, the acting presiding judge of the Second Criminal Court, opened the trial for investigation.</p>
<p>Appeal Trial of Murder of Cousin Opens: Guan Mao Da, the 11-year-old son of Guan Liukun, a resident of Houjiazhai Township in Baoshan County, was lured to the fields by his cousin Hou Genbao on May 6th of this year to catch frogs for fun, and was murdered by Mao Da. The body was buried in the mud. The next day (7th), Guan, Hou's mother, was hoeing the land in the fields when she caught sight of Mao Da's shoe heel sticking out of the loose mud. Guan, Hou's mother, then ordered Genbao to report the news to his uncle's family. At that time, Genbao fled in fear of guilt. After Guan Liukun received the news, he accompanied his clansmen to dig up the mud and saw Mao Da's body with his head down and feet up. He then reported it to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, which sent a police officer to the scene. Hou, Guan's mother, was suspected and taken to the district. On the morning of the 8th, Hou Genbao was hiding on Jiaotong Road and was discovered by the police officers of the Fourth District, who arrested Hou and interrogated him. He confessed that Guan Liukun had a 19-year-old niece named Cai Di. Genbao often went to his uncle's house to work in the fields and had an affair with Cai Di. They then agreed to murder Mao Da so that they could inherit Guan's property. Therefore, on the afternoon of April 8th (i.e., May 6th), he lured Mao Da to the outside and murdered him, etc. Guan Liukun confessed that on April 8th, because Jing'an Temple was holding a meeting, he went to Jing'an Temple to burn incense. When he returned home in the evening, he did not see Mao Da. At that time, he suspected that he was lost and did not go out to look for him. He planned to go to Shanghai the next day to post an advertisement to look for him, but later learned that he had been murdered. After the matter was discovered, Cai Di also fled without a trace. The case was then transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for investigation. After the trial, Hou Genbao was sentenced to death for murder. Hou refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyer Li Shuzhen to appeal to the High Court. Yesterday (11th) afternoon, Huang Bingdao, the presiding judge of the Third Criminal Court of the High Court, heard the case and summoned Guan Liukun, Guan Shuchen, and Hou's mother Guan to the court for questioning. Because further investigation of the evidence was required, the trial was adjourned to a later date.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Problems with Operating Cars in the Urban Area: Business cars in the county can only run from the railway station to the Tonghui Road intersection and to Meiyuan in the Western Township. Business is light through Huishan and other places. In addition, only Kaiyuan Township's public long-distance buses operate from Yinglong Bridge outside the West Gate to Meiyuan. Business is booming and there is a daily surplus. Last year, someone initiated the operation of public long-distance buses from the Tonghui Road intersection to Meiyuan, but it failed to materialize due to route issues. Recently, the Kaiyuan Township Public Long-Distance Bus Company submitted a request to the County Construction Bureau to operate public buses from the Tonghui Road intersection to Yanqiao on the Xi-Cheng Road. Another route connects Huishan with Kaiyuan's public buses. The bureau forwarded it to the Construction Department for approval. Now, an order has been received, stating that it is not impossible to operate from Tonghui Road to Huishan, but the Xi-Cheng Road is already operated by the Xi-Cheng Company, which makes it difficult to approve. After receiving the order, the company has now started to implement it. However, according to another message, someone had already started operating public buses from Tonghui Road to Huishan and can proceed as soon as the City Funds Property Management Committee approves and permits it. However, it is still a matter of dispute as to which company will operate it. Investigation and Discovery of Smuggling of Japanese Silkworm Eggs: The Silkworm Industry Control Office of the Agricultural and Mining Department sent personnel to Wuxi Station the night before last to investigate and discovered a large batch of Japanese silkworm eggs being smuggled. The people and goods were sent to the office for inspection. A total of 415 sheets of Japanese eggs were transported, and there was also a package of qualification certificates with the Silkworm Industry Control Office logo printed on it. After questioning, Yuan Shiying claimed that 300 of the Japanese eggs were bought at the Yuanyuan Store on Sichuan Road in Shanghai, and the remaining 115 sheets were bought at Xin Dahua. When asked where the qualification certificate came from, he said that it was sent from Wuxi. The office was quite shocked by the bizarre details and is now thoroughly investigating the truth to take action.</p>
<p>Long-Distance Telephone Connection of Nine Counties: The construction of the long-distance telephone connection of the nine counties of Su-Xi-Chang, which is handled by Jiangsu Province, was previously handled by Deng, the director of the Long-Distance Telephone Management Office sent by the Construction Department. Deng Fengwei decided to complete the section from Wuxi to Zhangjing first. Now the materials have been allocated and will be transported to the work site within days. Director Deng is also scheduled to come to Wuxi in the next few days to inspect and establish the exchange location. It is estimated that the Su-Xi-Chang telephone project can be completed by the end of October.</p>
<p>Soldier Indulges in Opium and is Sent to the County for Trial: Lu Haowen, an on-duty patrolman in the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau outside Guangfu Gate in the county, received a report the day before yesterday that Wang Lu's family on Zhongzheng Road was privately selling red pill lamps for opium smoking. After receiving the report, Lu Haowen immediately led Zhao Jiachen, the police officer of the Second Post, and Jiang Mingshan, the police officer of the Sixth Post, to search. They claimed that "I am the inspector of the Public Security Bureau and I am ordered to investigate opium," etc. When the opium dealer Wang Lu heard this, he was shocked and bargained with the police officers. In the end, he paid 100 yuan in exchange for avoiding arrest. Unexpectedly, this matter was discovered by Sun Rongding, the chief of the Second Branch, who immediately arrested the opium dealer Wang Lu and sent him to the bureau along with the three police officers Lu Haowen, Zhao Jiachen, and Jiang Mingshan. Yesterday afternoon at 3 pm, Wang Qi, the chief of the Third Section, interrogated them and ordered them to be transferred to the county government for trial.</p>
<p>Opium Dealer Dies of Illness and Wrongly Accuses the Judge: Jiang A-da, the owner of a red pill parlor on Dongda Street in the county seat, was arrested and sent to the county last month and sentenced to one month in prison. After being detained, Jiang became ill. Yesterday, he was approved by the county government to be released on bail for treatment. When the county government sent political police to the detention center to sign for his release, Jiang was seriously ill and on his last breath. As an expedient measure, the police sent Jiang directly to his home on Dongda Street and then returned to the county to report to Judge Yu. After receiving the report, Judge Yu believed that the prisoner had not been released after a formal investigation, and there might be other misconduct, so he ordered the police to summon Jiang to the court. When they arrived at Jiang's home, Jiang had already died. The police immediately took the original guarantor Hua Gengui back to the county to report. Judge Yu then took the coroner Shen to conduct an autopsy. Unexpectedly, when Jiang's mother, Jiang Gu, saw Judge Yu, she mistook him for Xia Xueqin, the prison officer and director of the detention center, and immediately pointed her finger at him and scolded him, saying, "My son was sick in prison, but you delayed reporting it and treating him, causing him to die. I want to fight you!" After the police explained, Jiang Gu realized that she had mistaken the prison officer and immediately asked for forgiveness. Judge Yu then ordered the coroner to conduct an autopsy to confirm that Jiang A-da had indeed died of illness and immediately ordered the widow to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

Wang did not answer, but a bullet flew over and Wang was shot in the left waist of his chest and fell to the ground. The second bullet flew over Zheng Yufu's head and face without causing any harm. They then helped Wang Boda up and took him to Wujin Hospital for treatment on the 10th. He must have his abdomen opened and disinfected before he can be said to be out of danger.</p>
<p>Capture of Bandit Chen Tiangen in Yutang: The Yutang Town Security Group in the Fourth District of Wu County captured a bandit in the town on the morning of the 10th and found evidence.

The Security Group sent a group of soldiers to Longhutang at 1 pm and notified the detective team of the Public Security Bureau in the city to come down to meet them. They were sent to the city that night. After being interrogated at the team headquarters, they were sent to the Public Security Bureau for investigation on the 11th.</p>

<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Sudden Twists and Turns in the Rotation of Police Officers. The directors and officers of the various district offices under the Municipal Public Security Bureau were ordered to go to the provincial capital for training. The Civil Affairs Department appointed Yang Chaoqun and Du Kui, graduates of the Police Academy, to take over. Except for Yang Chaoqun, who has already taken office, the others have not yet taken over their duties. It is reported that the former officers of each office, due to the hasty nature of the order, although they have been working hard to handle the various handover matters in recent days, the procedures are too cumbersome and cannot be completed in three to five days. Moreover, the amount of food expenses paid by the former officers is quite large, and the police pay was only received several days after the provincial order was issued. Due to various difficulties, the handover matters have been delayed. The newly appointed police officers, on the other hand, have been staying in hotels for more than a week and have incurred considerable expenses, which has caused them to worry that the former officers are deliberately creating difficulties. They telegraphed the province for instructions on the afternoon of the 6th. Unexpectedly, the matter was learned by the former directors and officers of each office, who believed that the actions of the new officers were inappropriate and were quite dissatisfied. Therefore, the handover, which was originally scheduled to take place within a few days, has been temporarily postponed, pending a reply from the province. The text of the telegram sent by the new officers to Zhu, the Director of Civil Affairs, is recorded below. "Most urgent. The personnel who should be transferred from the Ningbo Municipal Public Security Bureau dare to use bureaucratic tactics, create endless obstacles, disregard laws and orders, and refuse to hand over their duties. How can we promote Party principles and enforce laws and regulations if they disregard their reputation in this way? Please telegraph an order for them to hand over their duties immediately to maintain the authority of the government." Liu, Xu, Lu, Du, Shen, and Jin, the police officers taking over, from Putianchun Hotel in Ningbo, respectfully bow.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Improvement of Military Education</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education approved the Training Supervision Department's request regarding the Jiangzhe military training inspectors' recommendations for improving military education. After review, the ministry decided that it should be strictly followed. A special order was issued to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, stating:</p>
<p>"The Training Supervision Department's request, based on the recommendations of Wang Zemin and other military training inspectors sent to Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces this time, regarding matters that should be improved in the future, has been received by the ministry. After reviewing the various recommendations of the inspectors, the ministry found them to be adoptable. The ministry has conducted a detailed review of each item and listed its opinions. After consulting with the Training Supervision Department, an agreement was reached. The relevant measures are listed below: (1) The National Physical Education Law has been promulgated for some time, and schools in various provinces and cities should comply with it. However, military training is being implemented gradually. In high schools and above that have already implemented military training, students who fail the military training should not be allowed to graduate in accordance with Article 6 of the National Physical Education Law. Those that have not yet implemented military training should comply with the law after military training is implemented. (2) Military instructors shall not be absent from class without leave, and shall not be granted leave without approval. Classes missed due to leave shall be made up. If leave is taken for a long period of time, Article 8 of the Military Instructor Service Regulations shall still be followed, but the period shall not exceed one month. The above measures are of utmost importance to military education and should be strictly followed to facilitate improvement. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is also issued to the 'departments' and 'bureaus' to instruct their subordinates to comply with it."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Provides Relief for Students from Previously Unregistered Secondary and Higher Education Institutions Seeking Admission to Higher Education</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education received a report from the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau regarding the qualifications of graduates from private secondary and higher education institutions that were not registered during the Beijing government era and have been closed down after the Nationalist government took power. The bureau requested a review. The Ministry of Education recently instructed the bureau, stating: "Since the qualifications of graduates from private secondary and higher education institutions that were not registered during the Beijing government era and have been closed down after the Nationalist government took power cannot be verified, there is no way to recognize them. However, if these students need to pursue further studies or transfer schools, they can take the preliminary examination for graduates of unregistered private senior high schools and the qualification examination for graduates and students of unregistered and closed private vocational schools and above. The examination period has already passed. If necessary, another preliminary examination and qualification examination will be held in the future to provide relief and avoid regrets."</p>
<h3>Graduates from the Old System of Middle Schools Present a Petition to the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>Zhang Dingyuan and thirty other graduates from the old system of middle schools jointly presented a petition to the Ministry of Education regarding the qualifications of graduates from the old system of middle schools. They requested that the admission of graduates from the old system of middle schools to higher education be handled in accordance with the methods for graduates from the old system of normal schools, or that they be allowed to enter the third year of senior high school for remedial studies. The reasons they gave are: (1) Universities have abolished preparatory courses, and graduates from the old system of middle schools cannot directly apply to universities. (2) The old system of primary schools combines the junior and senior levels into a seven-year program. The new system of primary schools has six years, with four years in the former stage and two years in the latter. Comparing the two, the old primary school had one more year of primary school courses. In the new system, all the courses of the third year of the old senior primary school were raised to the first year of junior high school. Based on this comparison, it seems that graduates of the old system of middle schools with four years of study should be equivalent to the second year of senior high school in the new system. (3) In the past, the university and middle school systems were connected. Although preparatory courses have been abolished, the difference in years between graduates of the old system of middle schools and the university undergraduate program is only one year. If they can only enter the first year of senior high school, they would have to study for one extra year. Moreover, this year's graduation regulations of Central University state that graduates of the old system of normal schools who have served for more than two years are allowed to study at the College of Education of the university. It is necessary for Jiangsu Province to implement a single-line method, similar to medicine, to provide relief for graduates of the old system of middle schools to pursue higher education, or to allow them to enter senior high school for remedial studies in the third year and graduate with the senior high school students in school in order to apply to universities and pursue advanced studies."</p>

<h3>Cultural Aggression Organizations on the Jinghu Railway Line</h3>
<p>Three-Breeding Theological Seminary Run by Christians in Qiaotou Town</p>
<p>Bible is a Compulsory Course, Opposing Party Principles Courses</p>
<p>Students Must Promote Religion or Be Immediately Expelled</p>
<p>Mr. Xing Bencheng Presents a Report to the Municipal Propaganda Department for Strict Prohibition (Guomin News Agency) The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang received a letter from Mr. Xing Bencheng yesterday, painfully describing the absurdity of the private China Three-Breeding Society School in Qiaotou Town under the Jinghu Railway, and attached a draft news article requesting special publication in various newspapers, and also attached a copy of the school's charter. In addition to sending the received document to various newspapers for publication, the Municipal Propaganda Department also replied to Mr. Xing, requesting him to report it to the local Party headquarters immediately so that it can be forwarded to the central government for strict prohibition. The document from Mr. Xing is copied below. "In Qiaotou Town under the Jinghu Railway, Westerners have established the Three-Breeding Theological Seminary. The school was previously located on Ningguo Road in Shanghai and was originally named Three-Breeding University. It was founded by the Seventh-Day Adventist Church with the aim of implementing cultural aggression and anesthetizing Chinese youth. In 1924, students of the school revealed its inside story in the 'Awakening' column of the Min Guoribao, causing great panic at the school. With lightning speed, the students who submitted the articles were expelled, causing a huge uproar. Many students withdrew from the school on their own. The school's authorities, seeing that there were numerous Chinese-run schools in Shanghai and that revolutionary ideas were surging, falsely claimed that the Shanghai area was too noisy and unsuitable for running a school. They purchased 750 acres of mountainous land in Qiaotou Town and solicited huge amounts of money from overseas Chinese in Nanyang to build churches and school buildings. The buildings were beautiful and magnificent, and the equipment in the factories was even more perfect. Outsiders who saw its amazing appearance all thought that the school was an excellent school, but they knew that it was a den of cultural aggression, anesthetizing Chinese youth. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the Ministry of Education strictly ordered private schools to register. The Westerners were greatly panicked and held a meeting in Shanghai to discuss the matter. The result of the discussion was to change the school's name to Three-Breeding Theological Seminary, neither donkey nor horse, thinking that this would allow it to become a separate entity and avoid registration. The school history section of the school's charter does not mention a word about the name change to theological seminary. The Westerners' methods of cultural aggression against China can be described as cunning and treacherous. Based on the school's charter this year, I have extracted a few lines to show the school's insidious intentions and its intention to anesthetize the minds of Chinese youth: (1) Purpose: To promote the second coming of Christ as the purpose; (2) Divisions: Primary, University, High School, Junior High School; (3) Board of Directors: 20 Westerners, 4 Chinese (Chairman: A Westerner); (4) Principal: Li Bo, a Westerner; (5) Curriculum: The Bible is a compulsory course for both junior and senior high schools, and it opposes courses on party principles. It strictly prohibits the display of books on party principles in the library; (6) Extracurricular activities: Students must learn to promote religion during meals and must practice promoting religion, otherwise they will be immediately expelled; (7) Forced sale of books and newspapers: Each student must subscribe to Jesus books and Jesus newspapers, namely the 'Signs of the Times Monthly'; (8) Work-study student fees: Primary school students should pay 71 yuan in the first semester, high school students should pay 76 yuan in the first semester, business students should pay 89 yuan in the first semester, and primary university students should pay 98 yuan in the first semester. Medical preparatory students should pay 119 yuan in the first semester; (9) School calendar: The school calendar completely cancels the commemorative days of the party and the country."</p>
<h3>County Education Bureau Implements Educational Budget Measures for the 19th Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau has already drafted five measures for the implementation of the educational budget for the 19th year, which have been approved by the Political Affairs Committee. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Regular expenditures of all schools and educational institutions will be paid on a monthly average; (2) All income of all schools, institutions, and district offices will be submitted to the bureau on a monthly average; (3) Temporary expenditures will still be handled in accordance with the previously promulgated measures for drawing on temporary funds; (4) Temporary funds for schools in each district must be approved by the Education Committee and submitted to the bureau before they can be drawn on, and no requests for expenditure can be made to the district offices; (5) The tuition fees that district schools should pay will be submitted to the district offices on a monthly average.</p>
<h3>The Recent Situation of the Medical College of Central University</h3>
<p>The Medical College of Wusong National Central University was established in October of the 16th year. At the beginning of its establishment, only two levels were set up. Subsequently, one level was added each academic year. Starting from the 19th year, a fifth-year class was added, completing the five-year class schedule. The entrance examination is extremely strict. Half of the new students admitted are graduates of the pre-medical program of the College of Science of Central University, and the rest are graduates of pre-medical programs of well-known universities in the country and Bachelor of Science degree holders. The college's laboratory equipment allows students to conduct individual experiments. In terms of curriculum, both quality and quantity are emphasized. The professors of each subject are all studious and thoughtful scholars, and their research spirit is unwavering throughout the year. During this year's summer vacation, most professors compiled their research results into the teaching materials for this semester to supplement the textbooks. It is heard that since the beginning of the school year this fall, the teaching spirit has become even more vigorous.</p>

The following key cases were resolved: (1) The election of professor representatives for the school affairs meeting will be held within the next few days, and the meeting will be scheduled; (2) Regarding the school's funding issues, a request will be submitted to the Ministry of Education for the payment of arrears, and the president will be asked to prepare the necessary equipment costs; (3) The regulations for the student production work examination will be revised. Any student who is absent from work for eight consecutive hours or for sixteen hours in a semester will be expelled from the school and submitted to the school affairs meeting for decision and implementation; (4) A library committee will be convened regularly. There were many other key cases.</p>

<h3>Ten Thousand People Eagerly Await the Tide</h3>
<p>— Liu Henwo from Hangzhou</p>
<p>Where is the tide most spectacular? The Qiantang River is unmatched. This is a poem by Fan Zhongyan. The Zhejiang tide is renowned at home and abroad. On the eighteenth day of the eighth month, ten thousand people compete to admire it. Since the beginning of autumn, the wind and rain have been fierce. The tide in Haining is raging and surging, even more so than in previous years. As the tide season arrives, those going to watch it have already been traveling along the road in a continuous stream. It is expected that there will be an even grander scene when the time comes.</p>
<p>There are two places to watch the tide, one is in Haining and the other is in the Qiantang River. The men and women of Hangzhou, with their buildings near the water, mostly flock to the Nanxing Bridge on the Jianggan River, in the riverside shops, or at Erliang Pavilion and Sanlang Temple, etc. However, according to local people, there have been no huge tides to satisfy the public's expectations since the tenth year of the Republic. Unexpectedly, due to the great tide in Haining, it has restored its former glory. When the tide rises during the day, the silver mountains and snow waves are vast and surging. At night, the wind is even more urgent and roaring, with the power of thunder. If one gathers a small group in the moonlight of the thousandth evening at the Haiyue Bridge, buys wine in the tower, and gazes into the distance from the railing, this scene would be ethereal and heavenly.</p>
<p>The night tide is better than the daytime. However, Haining is a small town, remote and sparsely populated. There are no accommodations in the Dongtang area. Most of the viewers leave reluctantly. It is said that the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau, in light of this, has opened special tide-watching buses on the Hangzhou-Hai Road and is building a large viewing platform next to Zhongshan Park. Preparations are being actively made and arrangements are being completed. It is also planned to establish a tide-watching hotel to benefit those who like to watch the night tide. In general, tourists can feast their eyes day and night. Attached is a timetable of the large and small tides, day and night, of this month as a reference. The largest tides are on the 1st and 16th at late noon and midnight. On the 2nd and 17th, at early dusk and late midnight. On the 3rd and 18th, at early afternoon and early morning. On the 4th and 19th, at late dusk and late morning. On the 5th and 20th, at early evening and early dawn. The slightly smaller tides are on the 6th and 21st at late dawn and late dusk. On the 7th and 22nd, at early morning and early evening. On the 8th and 23rd, at late morning and early night. The tides gradually increase on the 9th and 24th, at early mid-morning and late night. On the 10th and 25th, at late mid-morning and early night. On the 11th and 26th, at early late-morning and late night. To the 12th and 27th, at early noon and early late-night. On the 13th and 28th, at late noon and early late-night. On the 14th and 29th, at early afternoon and late late-night is slightly smaller. Thereafter, the tides gradually increase again to the 15th and 30th at noon and early midnight.</p>
<p>The China Travel Service has always prepared a tide-watching tour group. This year, the site has been surveyed and is located in the Seaside Park to the Zhenhai Causeway, with seats for more than 500 people. It is heard that the date has been extended because of the high tide, for a total of nine days. The tide schedule has been published and is copied below for the reference of those watching the tide at sea. Starting from October 4th, the tide will be at 9:40 AM. On the 5th, 10:30 AM. On the 6th, 11:15 AM. On the 7th, 12:00 PM. On the 8th, 12:40 PM. On the 9th, 1:20 PM. On the 10th, 2:00 PM. On the 11th, 2:45 PM. On the 12th, 3:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Tragedies Amidst the Banditry in Jiangbei</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>The rampant banditry in Jiangbei has been mentioned repeatedly by Yu and Hong Xu Jun in this publication. What is recorded here is a tragedy amidst the banditry, a true account so that the authorities may know that the people of Jiangbei are living in dire straits.</p>
<p>A Town Reduced to Ashes in Two Hours: Wujie Bridge, a key town in the Xixiang area of Pingchao District, Tongzhou, is adjacent to the border. The bandits have repeatedly plotted to attack, but they have been unsuccessful due to thorough defense preparations. At the end of last month, the bandits suddenly attacked the garrison troops at midnight, with great force. The garrison troops responded in battle, and at the same time, thousands of bandits suddenly attacked the town in the rear, setting fires and looting. There were many women and children among them. The looting was directed by women and children. The loot was transported north by rickshaws. The garrison troops were lured out into a fierce battle, causing them to neglect the rear. In a short time, the fire illuminated the sky, and the cries were terrible. In about two hours, the entire town was reduced to ashes. Later, reinforcements arrived at full speed, and the bandits retreated.</p>
<p>Suffering the Torture of Smoke: Deputy Township Chief Zhao was shot dead by bandits while fleeing in panic. His son was kidnapped by bandits and subjected to the torture of smoke. The torture of smoke is one of the cruel tortures used by the bandits. People are stripped naked and smoked over a raging fire. When they are about to die, they are temporarily stopped to wait for them to recover until there is no more fun to be had. Zhao's son suffered a terrible fate and was truly unfortunate.</p>
<p>Township Chief Narrowly Escapes: Township Chief Qian Jianqing is a brave and promising young man. When the bandits approached, he sent an urgent telegram. When he tried to escape, he was surrounded on all sides. He changed into women's clothes and lay in the fields, covering himself with bean leaves. He held a pistol in his hand, so that if he was discovered by the bandits, he could jump out and resist. If he could not win, he would commit suicide to avoid torture. The bandits passed by him three times but did not discover him. Only when the bandits were far away did he come out. However, his house, the hundred-foot-high hall, had been turned into ruins.</p>
<p>Lingchi Punishment: Three bandits were captured. Later, they were escorted to the town and executed on the spot. The townspeople, believing that these people had ruined their families and that it was not enough to vent their anger by skinning and eating them, cut off their ears and noses, using their own methods to punish them. This made people feel a little better. However, the banditry has not been suppressed, and the chaos is difficult to end. Alas, the people are suffering. I don't know when they will be freed from this misery.</p>
<h3>A Rickshaw Puller Speaks</h3>
<p>— Tang Chengxin</p>
<p>My home is in Jinchang, Suzhou. One day, I went to Fengmenwai for something. I hired a rickshaw. The rickshaw puller was still young. He initially asked for three small silver dollars. I raised the price. He became angry and said, "I don't like to haggle over small amounts. It's fine if you want to ride. But I can't force you if you don't." I observed his demeanor and realized that he was not like the usual Jiangbei rickshaw pullers. So I smiled and nodded. On the way, I asked about his background. He said his surname was Xu. He was only nineteen years old this year, and he was literate. His home was in a village 120 miles outside Gaoyou City. There was only him in his family besides his grandmother and parents, the so-called only son. He had three acres of land, enough to make a living. There were no less than a thousand households in the village. Afraid of the bandits' frequent intrusions, they were unable to cultivate the land peacefully. So they raised money to recruit a wandering martial artist, skilled in Shaolin techniques. He selected thirteen strong and brave young men and taught them martial arts to defend the village. Xu was particularly intelligent and received the teacher's favor, learning everything he taught. Last year, the bandits came again. Xu led dozens of strong men to fight them, and the bandits were defeated and many were killed. The bandits held a deep grudge. This summer, they launched another major attack. Xu could not win and was captured. They demanded a ransom of 1,500 gold. His family could not afford it. The bandits once placed Xu in the bottom of the cabin and subjected him to cruel torture. As he spoke, he lowered his head to his legs, where there were obvious knife scars, which looked newly made. The bandits then moved elsewhere, taking Xu with them. One night, he waited until the guarding bandits were fast asleep and escaped. He ran dozens of miles and arrived in Changzhou the next morning in the faint light of dawn. His frightened soul was calmed. He then followed the Beijing-Shanghai Road south, begging for food during the day and begging for shelter at night. He walked for more than ten days, his hands and feet calloused. He arrived in Suzhou after much hardship. He met an old acquaintance who was making tofu in Suzhou, who introduced him to a rickshaw company, and he began his current life of pulling a rickshaw. As he spoke, he frequently looked at his arms, saying that he used to be fair-skinned but now he was like charcoal. He also said that he had to pay a rickshaw rent of 25 cents every day from morning to noon. The money he earned from his hard work, after paying the rent, was not enough for a thousand yuan. And his one meal required a升 of rice, and 斗 of rice would only last him three days. Given the current price of rice, how could he survive? He also recalled the residents of the village who were brutally killed during the banditry, and the houses that were reduced to ruins. He didn't know if his family would be able to reunite in the coming years. After he finished speaking, he couldn't help but feel sad, and tears streamed down. I had reached my destination, so I paid and left. I was deeply moved and wrote this down upon returning home.</p>
<h3>Travelogue of Nanyang (46)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>On May 10th, I left Singapore for Penang at 3:00 PM. My travel companion was Chen Youjia, originally named Yitong, a monk. We boarded the British ship "Glang," second class, which cost $20. This was a small steamer, and all the amenities were inferior to the third class of the French postal ship. The cabins were also narrow. The third class fare was $4.80, so I don't know why the difference was four times the price. Chen Guo Yu-jun from the Buddhist Association saw us off on a small boat rowed by one person. I was very wary, but the waves were calm. I often think that if everything were to be controlled by labor, who would use these small boats to risk their lives at sea for small profits? And if the world were to abolish the currency system, how would luggage be transported? Would the police order people to move it every step of the way? The new ideal state of the famous English author H.G. Wells still does not advocate the abolition of private ownership, which is a major problem. In general, the labor society of Nanyang is safer than the docks of China. This is because the Malay natives are the masters here, and those who have been here for a long time are naturally influenced by their simplicity. It is superior to the dangers of the domestic dock society. The docks in Shanghai and Hankou are full of crises. My friend and I have experienced many incidents, often encountering small kidnappings. Although there are guesthouses, there are still occasional accidents, so it is not as safe as the Nanyang society influenced by the ancient customs of the Malays. The morals of the Malays are higher than ours, just as the morals of the Mongols are higher than ours. There is a major academic problem here. It is not easy to understand immediately without studying the academics of Tolstoy, etc., and understanding the comparative history of ancient and modern culture. I don't have time to elaborate on this here. I have read many new sociological books from the West, and I realized it. There are very few second-class cabins on the ship. The ship is full of Chinese, and there are few Malays and Indians. I think China truly deserves to be a great country. The faces on the ships in the cities of Nanyang are no different from those in my hometown. The development of the nation is like this. Although there are various reasons, it is probably because Confucius emphasized filial piety and the Buddhists advocated repaying kindness, so people are happy to have children and grandchildren to multiply to this day. According to workers who have traveled to Europe, there are many Chinese in various countries. There are Chinese streets in England, and there are also Chinese as far away as Australia, so nationalism is truly a big problem. It's a pity that we don't understand the language, and we are like foreigners when we meet. Even though they are all Cantonese, there are dozens of kinds of Cantonese languages, so it is urgent to unify the national language.</p>
<h3>Eastern Travels Correspondence (17)</h3>
<p>— Wu Xiaohou</p>
<p>After completing their survey of Tokyo's municipal administration, the social education reporter of Yi Society, together with Mr. Uchida, head of the Japan-China Society, and Ms. Du Huairong, visited the Tokyo Municipal Education Bureau. They met with the Bureau Chief, Mr. Fujiyoshi Toshiyo. During the conversation, he stated that social education in Tokyo could be divided into three major categories: parks, libraries, and public education. He also mentioned that China and Japan share a common written language, and he greatly desired to visit China for observation. Before departing, Ms. Du took a group photo of the Bureau Chief and the reporter. Here is a detailed account of the questions and answers, as well as the actual observations made during visits to various public parks, libraries, and public education facilities in Tokyo. The facilities for social education in Tokyo only had a dedicated social education section established within the Municipal Education Bureau after Mayor To's time, during the Taisho 10th year. By Taisho 12th year, after the Great Kanto Earthquake, the citizens' thoughts evolved, and the spirit of loving the city became more profound. The concept of self-governance flourished, and social education undertakings became increasingly important. By the time the reporter visited Tokyo for investigation, it was already splendidly prepared. Although it cannot be on par with Europe and America, it can already serve as a model for various countries in East Asia. Its spirit of rapid advancement is indeed enough to demonstrate it.</p>
<p>(I) Overview of Tokyo's Parks Parks are the hubs of culture, and all countries regard them as important facilities. Westerners often say that a city is like the human body, and parks are like the lungs. A city without parks is like a human body without lungs. From this, we can understand that parks are essential elements of social education. The development of parks in our country also began very early. According to ancient books, King Wen's gardens covered seventy square miles, and the Lingtai and Lingzhao were places for sharing happiness with the people, which were also the beginnings of the park system. However, our country has traditionally lacked comprehensive and unified planning for such public facilities. In recent years, observing the external environment and examining current trends, we have gradually realized the importance of building parks. Japan recognizes parks as the only place for citizens' lives and spiritual comfort. The initial park plan was announced in Meiji 23rd year. By Meiji 36th year, Hibiya Park, the largest and only park in Tokyo, was finally established. By Taisho 2nd year, Inokashira Park outside the city, and Asakusa Park in Taisho 13th year, were successively constructed, springing up like bamboo shoots after rain. As of now, there are thirty-three large parks such as Hibiya, and fifty-one small parks such as Kami-rokku Park adjacent to the elementary school playgrounds throughout the city.</p>
<p>There is not much to describe about the small parks in Japan. The large parks include Hibiya, Kojimachi, Shimizu Valley, Toranomon, Chishima Kaen, Sakamotocho, Chiyoda, Sukiyabashi, Shiba, Atago, Nogi, Shirakawa, Edogawa, Yushima, Miyamoto, Asakusa, Imado, Matsuchiyama, Fukagawa, Asukayama, Inokashira, Yotsuya, Old Yasuda, Machiya, Otsuka, Shitaya, Midoricho, Dote, Daiba, and others, totaling thirty-three parks. The total area is 214,394,888 square meters. Among them, the largest area is Ueno Park in Shitaya Ward, with 61,295,931 square meters. The most magnificent and complete park is still Hibiya Park in Kojimachi Ward. The smallest and simplest park is Yotsuya Park in Yotsuya Ward, with an area of only 121,942 square meters.</p>
<p>Among the various parks in Tokyo, there are four so-called major parks: (1) Hibiya Park (2) Shiba Park (3) Asakusa Park (4) Inokashira Park.</p>
<p>(1) Hibiya Park. Hibiya Park is located in Nishihibiya Town and Yamashita Town in Kojimachi Ward. It occupies the plaza in front of the Nijubashi Bridge of the Imperial Palace and the site of the former daimyo's mansion south of the moat. After the Meiji Restoration, it became a military training ground. The entire park is flat, modeled after modern Central European parks, with various facilities. The opening date was June 1st, Meiji 36th year. It is truly the only large urban park in the city. The park's base is a rectangular shape running north-south, with six gates. The main gate in the center faces east and is called Hibiya Gate. At the intersection of the northeast tram lines is the Music Gate (formerly the Hibiya Sightseeing Gate). There is the Sakura Gate on the northern side of the moat. The Kasumigaseki Gate faces Kasumigaseki to the west. The Nishisaiwai Gate is beside the Hibiya Library to the southwest. The Saiwai Gate is located to the southeast near the Industrial Bank. It is surrounded by iron fences. The park's roads are curved and seven ken wide (4.2 meters), allowing for the passage of vehicles and horses, connecting all the gates. It is divided into four areas. Upon entering the main gate, there is an old water pump installed, as well as a small cultivated garden. It closely adjoins and surrounds the three sides. A concert hall is built on a high hill, especially designed to accommodate about two thousand people. Performances are held from the spring to the autumn season, playing beautiful music that cleanses the soul.</p>

<h3>Commercial News, Finance, and Gold Market Continue to be Extremely Dull</h3>
<p>Another Slight Improvement of 9 Candareens</p>
<p>The overall trend is the same as yesterday's market. The gold market situation on the 11th was little changed, with slow clearing and no progress. Fluctuations were limited to within two taels throughout the day, but continued to rise slightly. The exchange rate also did not change dramatically. Trading in the forward market was not busy. Only Yongshengchang, Wanxing, and hedging firms made purchases. Zhifengyong and others sold slightly. The initial trend was good. Although the large bars were long, the silver market did not change, probably because the United States seemed to be planning to release silver blocks, so the market was feared to decline. People's hearts were agitated because of this, with only occasional fluctuations of one or two cents. The market became extremely dull later, and the price was initially stable and then softened, only recovering a few cents, not much different from the day before yesterday. The spot market was also dull, causing the price to loosen. The forward price increased by about 18 taels.</p>
<p>The opening was slightly higher, with the opening price of the October gold standard at 563 taels and 1 mace, an increase of 1 tael and 3 mace. However, the morning rough market once rose to 64-65 taels. The silver bars had already increased by one-eighth, but it was not affected, because the European market was soft and items were being purchased. Later, it fell from 63 taels and 4 mace to 1 tael and 9 mace, and some people took the opportunity to sell. When the first order was announced unchanged, it was 62 taels 6-7 mace, and retail investors bought slightly. The exchange rate was stable. China-Belgium Bank bought October Dalian at 1 tael 2 mace 4 fen 7.5 li. Banks also did October British gold at 7 pence 625. After 10 o'clock, it was 63 taels. Afterwards, it fluctuated slightly for a few cents until around 11 o'clock, when some sales occurred, so it fell by about two taels, to 62 taels and 1 mace. After a while, the retail investors on the market all bought in, and HSBC bought December British gold at 7 pence 6875, which was sold from Shanghai. Then the market rose again, increasing by one tael and several mace, to 63 taels 6-7 mace at 11:30. Shortly after, it dropped by five or six cents, and closed at 63 taels at noon. The posted price was still 611 taels and 4 mace, a small decrease of about 48 taels.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market Was Even More Stable. The afternoon market opened at 63 taels 4 mace, then dropped by seven or eight cents because Yuanmaoyong and Hengxing sold. Therefore, at 2:30, it was 62 taels and 6 mace. The exchange rate was flat. Banks mutually did October Japanese gold at 1 tael 2 mace 4 fen 3.75 li. However, trading in the market was very scattered, at most one or two hundred bars, with very little activity. At 3 o'clock, it was 2 taels 8-9 mace. It was bought by Mr. Zhang. Afterwards, it decreased slightly by one or two cents. The market closed at 3:15, with the price at 62 taels and 7 mace, an increase of 9 candareens compared to the day before yesterday (10th). The maximum price for the day was 63 taels and 7 mace, and the minimum price was 61 taels and 9 mace, with only 1 tael and 8 mace of fluctuation. The posted price was a decrease of about 48-9 taels. The registered accounts were 74 taels for September and 63 taels for October. The spot goods opened at 3 taels and 3 mace in the morning, closed at 3 taels and 1 mace at noon, 3 taels and 2 mace in the afternoon, and closed at 2 taels and a half.</p>
<p>Minor Transactions Within the Market The transactions of various firms, including Dadesheng, Senchangyong, Yudai, Yuancheng Yong, and Fuchang, varied. Yongchengchang, Wanxing, and hedging firms all bought. Shunli, Zhifengyong, Hengxing, Shengdai, and Xinxian all sold. In the afternoon, Yuanmaoyong and Yongfeng sold slightly. Wanxing, Yudai, and retail investors bought. Other firms had very minor transactions. The Dalian group had about 1,000-odd bars of activity, mostly balanced out. The Guangdong group only sold a few hundred bars.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Exchange Rate is Mediocre</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listing prices and various exchange rates remained unchanged. However, the overseas market seemed to be softening due to rumors that the United States intended to sell large bars at the close of the market. As for the local exchange market, it was initially flat and then firm, and then flat again in the afternoon, without much fluctuation. The gold standard was still mediocre, fluctuating by only about two taels throughout the day. In the end, it rose slightly, and the closing prices of various exchange rates were no different from the day before. Chinese merchants settled several tens of thousands of pounds of British gold. Sumitomo and China-Belgium Bank sold. Various banks also did some mutual deals and inter-did 100,000 yuan of Japanese gold. The gold industry sold Dalian bills worth 100,000-200,000 yuan to Mitsui and China-Belgium Bank. There were no transactions in U.S. dollars, especially because the gold market ended early, so the exchange market felt even more dull. People's minds were calm.</p>
<p>The domestic British exchange rate only fluctuated by 0.0625. There were fewer transactions than the previous day. The morning ask price for September was 1 shilling 7.5 pence, October 5625, November 625, December 6875. The bid price was increased by 0.0625. The noon closing price for September was 4375, October 7.5 pence, November 5625, December 625. Afternoon trading was dull. The closing price for September was 7.5 pence, October 5625, November 625, December 6875. The bid price was 75.</p>
<p>The domestic U.S. exchange rate was very flat throughout the day, with only 0.0625 fluctuations. The morning ask price for the current month was 39.5 yuan, October 625, December 75, December 875. The bid price was increased by 125. The noon closing price for September was 39.4375, December 8125. The afternoon ask price for September was 39.5 yuan, and the bid price was 39.625 yuan. October and November were increased by 125 each. December was 39.875 yuan, and the purchase price was 40 yuan.</p>
<p>The domestic East exchange rate had a difference of only 25 throughout the market, and buying and selling were rare. The morning ask price for the current month was 1 tael 2 mace 5 fen 5, October 5 fen, November 4 fen and a half. The bid price was reduced by half a point. China-Belgium Bank sold 100,000 yuan in October in the previous market, at a price of 1 tael 2 mace 4 fen 7.5 li. Because the gold price was within 63 taels, the noon closing was similar to the early opening. In the afternoon, Sanlin and China-Belgium Bank mutually did 100,000 yuan of October Dalian, at a price of 1 tael 2 mace 4 fen 3.75 li. Mitsui absorbed 100,000 yuan of current Dalian at a price of 1 tael 2 mace 4 fen 6.25 li. The closing ask price for September was 1 tael 2 mace 5 fen 25, bid price 4 fen 75. The ask price for October was 4 fen 75, November 4 fen 25, and the bid price was 3 fen 75.</p>
<h3>Overseas Silver Prices Rise Repeatedly</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's London telegram, the large silver bars continued to lengthen because China bought in and the supply was scarce. The market situation softened slightly, but the United States planned to sell at the close. Both near and far futures increased by 125, both at 16 pence 75 (equivalent to British gold at 1 shilling 7 pence 18125). Also, according to the New York telegram, the U.S. silver price was still 36.25 cents. Both the British to U.S. and U.S. to British rates fell by 0.0625, both at 4 yuan 86.25 cents.

Also, a telegram from the Datong News Agency came at 9:50 this morning, and there were no changes.</p>
<h3>Interest Rates Firm and the Market is Quiet and Scattered</h3>
<p>General Market Situation Yesterday, the interest rate market was still stable, and there was nothing to attack. However, the market atmosphere in various aspects was unusually quiet and scattered. Even the various collections and disbursements of the banking sector were far less than in the past few days. The main reason for this is that the country is unsettled by bandits, and the transportation of goods is difficult. The commercial situation of various industries cannot be expanded as desired, which has led to this.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices (Foreign Interest) The interest rates for both the morning and afternoon markets were the same at 7 mace 2 fen 9 li 7 hao and a half, which was 6 hao and a half better than the morning market on the previous day, and the situation seemed very strong. (Silver Interest) The morning market was 4 fen, and the afternoon market was 3 fen, which was slightly more active than the previous day. However, there was still no market for drawing heads and adding water. There were also no quotations for bank listings.</p>
<p>Auxiliary Coin Market Situation The morning price of Jiangnan small foreign coins was 6 mace 4 fen 8 li, and the afternoon price was the same. The transaction volume was 6,000 yuan in the morning and 2,000 yuan in the afternoon. The morning price of Guangdong small foreign coins was 6 mace 3 fen 1 li, which was 1 li better than the previous day, and it was the new high price that has never been reached this year. The afternoon price was still the same. The transaction volume was 225,000 yuan in the morning and 115,000 yuan in the afternoon. The Dalian group shipped more than 200,000 yuan. Copper coins were changed to increase by 3,000, to 189,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver Funds) Yesterday, the bank collections and disbursements were very rare. Chinese merchants collected and disbursed 1.4-1.5 million yuan, foreign merchants collected and disbursed over 1 million yuan, and various cargo exchange taxes and miscellaneous funds collected and disbursed over 7 million yuan. 900,000 yuan was taken out of the warehouse. Japanese banks collected and disbursed over 2.7 million yuan for various funds and took 600,000 yuan out of the warehouse. The private money shops collected and disbursed over 34 million yuan, over 310,000 yuan of drawing head funds, over 1.2 million yuan of various remittances, and over 1 million yuan in cash. (Foreign Funds) Remittance and transfer tickets made 1.36 million in the morning and only 520,000 in the afternoon. Only 5,000 yuan was traded in the afternoon. Off-market banknotes were 130,000 in the morning and 45,000 in the afternoon. Bank transactions made 500,000 in the morning and 400,000 in the afternoon. The collection and disbursement of foreign accounts between banks was over 1.2 million yuan, and the inflow and outflow of banknotes was over 1.5 million yuan. The private money shops collected and disbursed over 3.6-3.7 million yuan, over 2.4 million yuan of foreign drawing head funds, over 1.3 million yuan of foreign loans, and over 600,000 yuan of small money shop transactions. 240,000 yuan of Hangzhou currency continued to arrive, and over 200,000 yuan arrived from the Yangtze River. Only over 400,000 yuan was shipped out.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Rise and Fall Mutually</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions of various government bonds, the spot opened a total of 19,000 yuan, futures over 9.6 million, of which the demobilization transaction still reached 4.35 million, reorganization was calculated as over 2.8 million, customs duties over 2.7 million, other bonds were even more scarce than before. As for the trend of various bond prices, due to the chaotic environment and the instability of the market, prices suddenly rose and fell, and the situation was very chaotic. The internal demobilization and reorganization fluctuated by about one yuan, and the customs duties rose and fell by eight or nine cents, while other bonds hardly changed. Compared with the previous day, the customs duties and reorganization futures rebounded by about half a yuan, the demobilization rose in the near term and fell in the long term, and the others only rose and fell by a few cents.</p>
<p>Bond Category Opening Price Closing Price Change From Previous Day Transaction Volume.

<h3>Yarn, Cotton, and Yarn Market Show No Progress</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, but the American cotton market tended to rise, and the Three Goods yarn also rose by two yuan. The local yarn market was still softening. It was really because the war was chaotic and bandits were everywhere, resulting in a large stagnation in the sales of existing yarn. Therefore, most people's hearts were depressed and unanimously viewed low. Ruida represented a yarn factory to sell 5,500 pieces, so the market fell in the afternoon, but a certain manufacturer's bulls remained unchanged.</p>
<p>People's Mark was Strong in the Morning and Soft in the Afternoon. The People's Mark opened in the previous market and rose with foreign cotton. People's hearts were slightly firm. Later, due to the stagnation of the sales of existing yarn, sellers still poured in, and the prices of each month fell back, resulting in an increase of five, six, and seven cents each. In the afternoon, Ruida sold out of the market, and the market turned down by two, three, and four cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 18,350 bales. It was found that Ruida sold 5,500 bales, Gongtai 1,650 bales, Tongfeng 1,000 bales, Lichang 700 bales, and others 250 bales to 450 bales. Dafeng bought 1,350 bales, Tianchang 2,000 bales, Yichang 1,100 bales, Yukang 800 bales, Heshen 850 bales, Hengchang 950 bales, Rongxing 700 bales, and others 350 bales to 450 bales. The closing prices of People's Mark are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>People's Mark Closing Price Rise/Fall Account Balance Closing Price Rise/Fall Account Balance September 1521 Rise 3 18,750 December 1511 Rise 4 30,650 October 5513 357,600 January 1512.2 24,500 November 1512 339,300 February 1513 493,000 Current Sales Were Mediocre The sales of existing yarn were still flat. The total statistics for the day were 1,000 bales bought by each gang. There were 145 bales in the same industry. The market fell by five cents. 665 bales were bought by customers in Sichuan, 25 bales in Xiamen, 100 bales in the mainland, 50 bales in Shantou, 85 bales in Luzhou, and 80 bales were bought in.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Turns Higher</h3>
<p>The cotton market turned higher because American cotton rebounded and the weather was unstable, causing the market to become more firm. Buyers increased, and there were also large households hedging, and the number of bales was very large. Therefore, the table was very dry. Buyers took the opportunity to tighten, so the situation became even tougher. However, the sales of existing cotton were dull, and all factories were not interested. It is said that the harvest in the Hubei area is optimistic, so the Han gang sold off when the price rose. If the American cotton can continue to be good, the local cotton may be able to recover a little.</p>
<p>Han Mark was Excellent The Han Mark opened in the previous market and rose with American cotton, and the situation was quite good. There was also Tianchang pulling, and each month rose by three or four cents. In the afternoon, Ruida sold slightly looser, and each month fell by five cents to one cent. The total transaction volume for the day was 48,700 piculs. It was found that Ruitian sold 6,900 piculs, Shenchang 5,300 piculs, Yijun 2,900 piculs, Hengchang 1,900 piculs, Xincheng 1,500 piculs, Tianlong 1,100 piculs, Maoji 1,200 piculs, and others 600 to 1,000 piculs.

<h3>Grain and New Rice Market Conditions Consistently Upward</h3>
<p>The source from the mainland in Zhabei yesterday was scarce, and the river storage was extremely thin. The northern gang's broken japonica rice was consistently flat and stable, and the price was neither glorious nor disgraceful. However, the market shape turned firm due to the rain. The western new japonica rice did not arrive in Shen yesterday, and the eastern new japonica rice opened high at 18 yuan, and the market shape was raised by three or four corners. At the moment, the japonica rice situation is fluctuating, and the situation is greatly dependent on the weather. The thin indica rice was scarce and rare, and the new sheep tip market was raised outside the corner because the source was reduced, so the new customer tip rose by three corners, the big plate opened high at fourteen yuan and two corners, and Baiyuan has always been flat and stable, and the price has not risen or fallen.</p>
<p>There was not much arrived at the Shanghai South River, and the sales in this street turned crisp. In addition, the weather was rainy and people's hearts were prosperous. The broken japonica rice was scarce and greatly reduced, and the market prices were all firm and stable. The situation of the southern gang's thin indica rice was slightly tight, and the storage has always been dry. The large plates all followed the japonica rice price, and there was little difference for the time being. Both the customer tip and the foreign rice were raised by three or four corners, and the situation was excellent. Baiyuan also announced an increase, reaching the 19 yuan mark. If the weather continues to be cloudy, the rice situation in each file may be unexpectedly prosperous.</p>
<h3>Customer Xian Arrived in Large Numbers and Sales Were Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no foreign rice market. The customer xian transaction was still good because the appetite on this street was very strong. The Tianjin gang also took care of 500 bags of Jiangxi machine early, and people's hearts in the market were all optimistic. However, there were also a small number of Hunan and Jiangxi rice arriving in port, and a batch of Wuhu rice also continued to arrive. In addition, there were reports of the listing of Du customer xian rice from various routes. It is hoped that the subsequent source will gradually increase, so although the sales are active, the market is still flat. The total transaction volume in the city was 100 bags of Wuhu machine rice, more than 100 bags of 頺 rice, 500 bags of Jiangxi machine late, and 2,500 bags of machine early, of which, in addition to the Tianjin gang taking care of 500 bags of machine early, all of them were taken care of by this street and rural village. The sales opening market is recorded in the price list.</p>
<h3>The Standard Flour Market Rises Step by Step</h3>
<p>It is rumored that the Tianjin port has a regular opening ban saying that after the opening of the flour market yesterday, the upper and lower markets were seen to rise step by step. The current month is digested by the Tianjin gang, and the first plate is as high as two taels and five cents and seventeen li. It continued to be good, and the distant months all followed. After slightly softened, the closing was good again. The closing month was large seven five, October large one cent two five, November positive February various large one cent eight February large one cent half, and the closing situation was particularly strong. Since the Tianjin embargo has been going on for a long time, according to the news from the customs declaration line yesterday, the customs has set Friday (that is, today) to open the ban and start transportation. Although this news is not completely known, some customers and manufacturers rushed to receive it early, so the market price was seen to rise sharply.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Shifts from Bullish to Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw improved sentiment after trading opened due to the lifting of flour restrictions in Tianjin. Although there was some profit-taking by Yangtze River speculators, new advisors were active, and the market improved from weak to good. However, rumors of fixed prices for foreign flour and wheat caused the market to stagnate. As a result, September futures remained unchanged, October futures were down one fen, November futures were unchanged, December futures were up two fen, and February futures showed no change. Spot wheat, however, had been stagnant for many days. Due to reports of smooth passage through Tianjin, small and medium-sized factories had begun purchasing. A total of 5,000 bags were traded, consisting of wheat from Shandong's Xuzhou and Haizhou, priced between 49.2 qian and 4 taels 7 qian.</p>
<h3>Dalian Soybean Decline Remains Uncertain</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Dalian Standard Yuan December soybean futures continued their downward trend as news of a good autumn harvest for this year's local soybeans caused both cargo owners and speculators to sell off. The market fell another four to five fen yesterday, closing at 5 taels 2 qian 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Sugar Market Remains Depressed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market reports from producing regions indicated that the spot price of Cuban sugar was 0.125, a slight decrease of 0.03125 compared to the previous report. New York futures were priced at 1.08 for September (down two fen), 1.15 for December, 1.27 for March of next year, and 1.36 for May (all down one fen). The spot price of Javanese sugar was 8.75, and sugar futures for October were 8.50, with no increase or decrease compared to the previous report. November futures were priced at 8.25, down 0.125. On the Shanghai market, the price of Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white remained weak, with sellers quoting 8 taels but few buyers. No. 20 medium white was priced at 7 taels 6 qian 5 fen, and finely ground white sugar was priced at 8 taels 1 qian, with little trading. Demand for Japanese sugar was also weak, and sellers were looking to raise prices. "Z Mark" was quoted at 8 taels 1 qian 5 fen, but buyers were only willing to pay 8 taels 5 fen, leading to a stalemate. "Z Mark" settled at 8 taels 1 qian, "YT Mark" at 8 taels 5 fen, and "SB Mark" at 8 taels, with slight trading and a dull market atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Northern Jiangsu/Anhui Goods: Shima Sun-Dried Meat Opens at 41 Taels</h3>
<p>The supply of sun-dried longan pulp has increased slightly recently, leading to a weakening trend. Yesterday's market saw over fifty boxes, nearly two taels lower than the previous trading session. However, Shima sun-dried meat, being a secondary arrival and in small quantities, opened at 41 taels. The outlook for the market is bearish.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea from Sichuan Factories Experience Slight Increase in European Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market in Shanghai showed no signs of improvement due to sluggish sales and weak prices of white silk in European and American markets. Only yellow silk from Sichuan factories saw a slight rebound due to telegrams, with Xinfu and other firms importing fifty bales of iron-machine silk at flat prices.</p>
<h3>Changes in Autumn Silkworm Development in Wuxi</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of rain and sudden cold, farmers in Wuxi and surrounding villages are not facing a weak autumn silkworm season. However, because of the timing of silkworm egg hatching, the silkworm season is staggered by about half a month. The weather was clear and pleasant after the silkworm eggs hatched, and the silkworm larvae developed well. However, recent continuous autumn rains and cold weather have caused changes in the silkworm development, with instances of silkworms dying and discharging yellow liquid. Early silkworms have already started spinning cocoons, while late silkworms are only in the third instar, opening leaves, and their condition is not good. A bountiful harvest is unlikely.</p>
<h3>Autumn Silkworm Tax in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Reduced by Half</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has approved a 50% reduction in the autumn silkworm tax for both Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, regardless of whether the silk is shipped out of the province or remains within. Last year, although Jiangsu Province was approved for tax exemption, this was only limited to goods transported to treaty ports. Those who reeled silk inland were required to pay the full autumn silk tax, creating unequal treatment. Silk and cocoon merchants repeatedly petitioned the ministry, and the Ministry of Finance has now approved a 50% reduction in the cocoon tax for the current autumn silkworm harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, regardless of whether the silk is shipped out of the province or remains within, to ensure fairness.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firm Tea Market: Varying Degrees of Liquidity</h3>
<p>Recently, high-grade Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi, handled by Jinlong, Yongxing, and Tongfu, has continued to see strong interest from buyers, and sales prices have remained unchanged. However, Zhenmei tea from Shexian and Suian remains sluggish. Qining black tea is also ignored. The overall tea market momentum is weakening.</p>
<h3>Zhigong Satin from Piece Goods Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market showed mixed trends, with fine twill recovering. Yanghe Blue Double Fish rose another 2.5 fen, with very limited spot goods available due to extensive short selling combined with strong recent demand, leading to a sell-out situation. Fine cloth gradually declined, with only Caqiu selling for 6 taels 9 qian 2.5 fen due to demand from Niuzhuang and Tianjin for two hundred pieces. Yanghe sold for only 6 taels 8 qian 2.5 fen. Blue Double Fish Hunter also saw declines. Coarse cloth, 11-pound goods, were down 2.5 fen; 15-pound Sima were down 5 fen; and 16-pound Wuhe Hangzhou goods saw transactions of fifty pieces, with no significant demand from Ningbo and Yangtze River buyers.</p>
<p>The trend in the market for piece goods from East and West remained strong. Yesterday, Yuanfang Jiaozhuang in the West goods market saw further increases. Fangli Yannian Zhigong Nini sold open at 2 qian 4 fen, boosting market sentiment. However, East goods, having risen too sharply, saw unsold cheaper goods purchased by buyers, and with varieties such as Shuilang Yuehua velvet approaching fixed prices, sales suddenly stalled yesterday. The once intense surge in prices showed signs of slowing down. Only Zhigong satin continued to rise, with Wulu opening at 3 qian 7 fen, Bajun at 3 qian 6 fen 5 fen, Tianci Huangjin at 3 qian 3 fen, and Diyigong at 3 qian 1 fen, with no spot goods available. Queqiao Huifei Tong opened at 2 qian 8 fen 5 fen, up another 0.25 to 0.5 fen, due to the lack of inventory.</p>
<h3>Hardware, Tobacco Tinplate, and Enamel Factories are Thriving</h3>
<p>Five or six hundred bundles of 18-sheet tobacco tinplate with floral patterns were purchased from local enamel factories yesterday for 10 taels 7 qian 5 fen. Demand from buyers in Tianjin, Qingdao, and other locations was also strong, leading to a very positive market outlook. Three-foot six-inch thick floral patterns also saw many transactions due to local stove making, and the market trend is expected to remain firm, with sales at 9 taels 2 qian 5 fen.</p>

<h3>Direct Shipping Between China and Australia</h3>
<p>Australian Eastern Company Dispatches Three Steamers</p>
<p>First Voyage on October 12 China and Australia have never had direct shipping routes before. Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>traveling to places like New Gold Mountain (Melbourne), Sydney, and Thursday Island usually have to transfer ships in Hong Kong or Japan. Even the goods we ship from China to Australia cannot be directly connected. The procedures are complicated and the transshipments are difficult. Recently, there has been a gradual increase in goods exported from Shanghai to Australia, and the number of overseas Chinese going to New Gold Mountain and other places is also increasing daily. The British Australian Eastern Steamship Company, in order to expand its shipping routes to China, has specifically opened direct postal ships between Shanghai and Australia, setting a new record for South Pacific shipping to China. Details are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Three Postal Ships Designated The Australian Eastern Steamship Company has designated three 9,000-ton postal ships for the Shanghai route: Danda, Nuofo, and Saint Aiping. According to regulations, one ship will be dispatched to Shanghai each month, and they will be formal postal ships with a regular schedule. Their business includes the delivery of mail, passenger transport, and cargo loading. The British Shipping Company has been appointed as the general agent in Shanghai, and all cargo and passenger transport will be handled by the company issuing bills of lading and tickets. The first ship dispatched is the Nuofo, and we have received a telegram from New Gold Mountain stating that it is scheduled to arrive on October 11 and begin its voyage to Australia on the 12th. From now on, Shanghai-bound cargo and passengers can avoid the inconvenience of transferring ships in Hong Kong and Japan.</p>
<p>Route Regulations The route of the direct shipping postal ships between China and Australia has been determined. It will depart from Shanghai, pass through Hong Kong and Singapore, to Briston, then to Thursday Island, then to Sydney, and finally arrive at New Gold Mountain. Goods destined for various ports in South Australia, such as Auckland and Wellington, will also be transshipped and connected.</p>
<p>China-Australia Freight Rates With the opening of direct shipping between China and Australia, the company has set freight rates for goods from Shanghai, such as mineral sand, soybeans, tea, and leather. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Three staff members have arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, they visited the Japanese Consulate to meet with the Japanese Acting Consul, Shigekawa, to discuss the procedures for Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations. They left in the afternoon. It is now reported that Committee Member Yoshino and others have agreed with Acting Consul Shigekawa to go to Beijing tomorrow night to visit Foreign Minister Wang and Minister of Communications Wang to discuss the procedures for the meeting and exchange preliminary opinions. If Foreign Minister Wang comes to Shanghai tomorrow, they plan to meet him in Shanghai first and then go to Beijing next week. They have already telegraphed Foreign Minister Wang for consultation. As for the date of the official meeting, the Japanese side has decided to hold it after the 20th because they need to exchange private opinions first to ensure smooth progress. However, according to Committee Member Yoshino, the case will first seek the opinions of the Chinese side and conduct thorough research before determining the negotiation strategy. Currently, there are no preconceived ideas.</p>
<h3>Belgian Socialist Leader to Visit Shanghai</h3>
<p>Brief Biography of Mr. and Mrs. Vandervelde Mr. and Mrs. Vandervelde, leaders of the Belgian Socialist Party, arrived in China to observe and traveled to Beijing via the Siberian Railway. They will travel south within the month and, after arriving in Shanghai, will inspect the Yangtze River area. A brief biography is recorded below: Mr. Vandervelde was born in Brussels. After graduating from secondary school, he studied law, sociology, and economics at the University of Brussels. He soon obtained doctoral degrees in law and sociology and served as the leader of the Belgian Socialist Party, a member of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Mr. Vandervelde obtained his doctoral degree at the age of only nineteen and soon became a lawyer. During his student years, he participated in the social movement, which began to sprout at the end of the 19th century and gradually became a prominent force. In 1885, he joined the Belgian Labor Party, which was founded on socialist principles and served as the foundation for today's development. The development and organization of this party relied heavily on Mr. Vandervelde. In the shortest time, it became the largest political party in Belgium, proving that half of its creation was due to Mr. Vandervelde. Familiar with this matter for many years, his goal was to promote the aspirations of society and improve the knowledge of ordinary people. He was later elected as a member of the Chamber of Representatives. In 1888, he founded the Socialist Party Student Federation. Mr. Vandervelde vigorously promoted socialism and also served as the Dean of Sociology at the University of Brussels. The establishment of this department was largely due to the support and donations of the great industrialist Solway. Since the national election in 1894, he has been elected as a member of parliament and continues to hold this position, making him the sole owner of this party. The fact that ordinary people can seek knowledge and can enter the People's University at any time is all due to Mr. Vandervelde's pioneering achievements. At the beginning of the European War, Mr. Vandervelde was invited to join the cabinet. From 1916 to 1918, he served as the Minister of People's Resistance, Food and Grain. From 1918 to 192</p>

<p>Japanese Ships Also Compete for Shipping The Osaka Company of Japan is adding China-Australia routes due to the suspension of some foreign ships. This matter is already under negotiation. It is said that three steamers will be dispatched to open the route first, and once the agreement is reached, they plan to dispatch regular ships within the year.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau to Act as Agent for Weihai Postal Transport</h3>
<p>Taikoo Postal Transport Contract Expires The China Merchants Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Communications stating that after the recovery of Weihaiwei, the Taikoo Company's postal transport contract is about to expire and instructed the bureau to send ships to replace it and transport mail. It is reported that the bureau's Northern Ocean regular ships, Xinming and Xinfeng, will add Weihaiwei to their routes, making one round trip per week. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Postal Administration to inquire whether they could follow the precedent of the British government's contract with Taikoo and provide an annual subsidy of 4,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Jinliyuan Case</h3>
<p>External Affairs Ministry Requests Documents The External Affairs Ministry believes that the lawsuit between the China Merchants Bureau and Sandetang, although expected to be resolved soon through arbitration by both parties, involves diplomatic matters. Therefore, it specifically requested the Ministry of Communications to provide the English text of the contract signed on December 4, 1916, the original English text of the first instance judgment of the French Court on January 7 of this year, and the original English text of the second instance judgment of the court on May 23 for reference. The Ministry of Communications has already ordered the documents to be obtained and forwarded separately.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Cracks Down on Factories and Warehouses Raising Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai rice market has been managed by the Social Bureau's price evaluation and distribution, the rising trend has slowed down slightly. In addition, this year's weather has been favorable for harvesting, and new rice has arrived in port one after another, making the rice market even more stable. Since August 15, the peak price of 21 yuan has not been seen. However, factories and warehouses, such as the Xieji Company, have been purchasing train rice, and because the amount is not large, it has not been evaluated. Recently, prices have been repeatedly raised intentionally to manipulate the market, disregarding the people's food supply, and affecting rice from the river. It is reported that the Social Bureau has ordered the Machine Rice Milling Association to notify all factories and warehouses that all rice arriving must be lightly evaluated before it can be sold. If prices are raised again, they will be fined more than 1,000 yuan according to the regulations for destroying price limits. It has also ordered the Bean and Rice Trade Association, the Rice Grain Public Association, and other associations to prohibit the operation of factory rice that has not been evaluated. If there is any collusion, they will be punished equally.</p>
<h3>Japanese Telecommunications Negotiation Committee Goes to Beijing</h3>
<p>Visits Ministers of Communications and Foreign Affairs to Exchange Opinions The Japanese special committee member Yoshino and his Mr. Vandervelde's wife, Ms. Clerkman, worked as a doctor at the age of 22. From the European War to 1921, she served as a doctor in various hospitals in Brussels. She also served as a school doctor and a lecturer in hygiene and infant hygiene at various normal schools. She also served in various social charities and as the chairman of the workers' interest group. Since 1921, she has been studying the faces and psychology of prisoners and is the first female doctor in this position. This position is of great responsibility. In the future, prisoners in Belgium may be able to repent and reform. The wife has written many scientific books on the psychology of prisoners, which have been published in various medical journals. Her book on the lives of Jews in Palestine, co-authored with Mr. Vandervelde, is especially popular in the world.</p>
<h3>Futre Peiyuan Banqueted Diplomatic Circles Yesterday</h3>
<p>Futre Peiyuan, Chargé d'Affaires of Turkey in China, hosted a banquet at his residence on Jupres Road at 7 p.m. yesterday, inviting Li Jinlun, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Liu Yunfang, Deputy Director of the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They enjoyed themselves very much.</p>
<h3>Two Views on the Increase in Water Prices</h3>
<p>Pearson's Talk</p>
<p>Cannot Be Justified Guowen News Agency reports that yesterday's Continental News published a statement by Pearson, the manager of the Waterworks Company, which is translated as follows: The Waterworks Company has increased water prices due to the depreciation of exchange rates, and the reasons have been explained to the Public Works Bureau. The prices of all imported goods, such as machinery, chemicals, and raw materials, have increased due to the sharp depreciation of exchange rates. Other items, such as coal and labor, although produced domestically in China, have also been greatly affected by the exchange rate depreciation. The Waterworks Company's income comes partly from water meters and partly from collecting 6% of the water price based on rent. As rent increases, the water price naturally increases. However, the increase in residents' water consumption is more than double what it was before. According to the contract signed between the Public Works Bureau and the company, the share capital has a fixed annual dividend. This fixed annual dividend rate has been estimated to attract new capital so that the company's capital can be increased to meet the needs of the rapidly increasing residents. Residents currently use 50 million gallons of water per day, while 25 years ago, it was only 7 million gallons. However, the increase in the number of residents in these 25 years is not even double. The company also believes that the price increase is a last resort. However, in order to meet the needs of users and ensure the quality of tap water, all filter machines, pumping machines, and water delivery machines in the company must be expanded as much as possible, which will increase costs. In the face of high prices, there is no other way but to increase water prices. The company is very satisfied with the results of managing tap water. If users want the company to continue its current results, it is necessary to increase surcharges.</p>
<p>Another report states that after the Shanghai Municipal Council approved the Public Concession Waterworks Company's water price increase of 25% from September 1 of this year, residents in the concession were panicked. The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association took the lead in opposing the proposal, followed by the Shanghai Real Estate Association. In addition to requesting the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association to lead the opposition, they also submitted a protest letter to the Waterworks Company. The protest letter was published in various Chinese and foreign newspapers in this port. Yesterday, after the Continental News published the statement by Mr. Pearson, the manager of the Waterworks Company, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency went to the Shanghai Real Estate Association in the Central Trust Company building on Beijing Road and met with Mr. Tao, the secretary of the association, to inquire about his opinion on the manager's statement. According to Mr. Tao, Mr. Pearson's statement has acknowledged the reasons for our association's protest as fair. The only reason he believes for the price increase is that the dividend is insufficient. The reason for the insufficiency is due to the depreciation of exchange rates. According to my opinion, when the exchange rate was high in 1920, the company proposed a price reduction. Today, it is fair to propose a price increase due to the depreciation of the exchange rate. There is no objection to this. However, it was happy to enjoy the benefits without decline when there was a great profit in the past. Now, it is only slightly insufficient, and only three years after the price was increased by 20%, it is increased by another 25%, which is very unfair. Moreover, even according to the current calculation, the dividend is not completely lacking. It is only that it is not possible to reach the highest 9% and there is no bonus to be distributed. In addition, it is said that the population has increased and the water consumption has increased. However, unless the three ratios of population, rent, and water price per gallon in the past 25 years are made clear, the statement is still empty talk and cannot be a reason for the water price increase.</p>
<h3>Japan's External Exports Decreased in August</h3>
<p>The Japanese Commercial Office in this port received a telegram from Japan yesterday stating that Japan's external trade exports in August were worth 127 million Japanese yen, which was about 30 million Japanese yen more than the value of imports. However, compared to the exports of various goods last year, all except coal have decreased. The imports of various goods, except for wool and woolen products, have shown a significant downward trend, indicating the sluggishness of the Japanese economy. Although external trade in August was in surplus, the total surplus for the first eight months of this year was still 180 million Japanese yen. At the same time, gold coins worth 240 million Japanese yen flowed out of the country. As for trade with China, the surplus in August was 18 million Japanese yen, and the total surplus for the eight months of this year was 50 million Japanese yen. However, compared to the surplus in the same period last year, it has decreased by 53 million Japanese yen.</p>
<h3>Important News on the Yangtze River Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>Shashi Steamer Encountered Danger in Jinzhou The Taikoo Company's Xiangtan steamer, which was traveling from Shanghai to Hunan, was fired upon by bandits while passing through the Qizhou River. At that time, the bow of the Xiangtan was hit by three shells, but fortunately, they were empty shells, and the ship only suffered minor damage, and the passengers were safe.

<h3>Wu Zhihui Gives a Lecture in Maqiao</h3>
<p>The Yutang People's Education Center in Shanghai County, in order to achieve the goals of universal education and rural improvement, organized a Rural Economic Improvement Association. The inaugural meeting was held at the Niu Family's Airi Hall yesterday. More than a hundred members and guests, including Wu Zhihui, Niu Yongjian, and Wang Chengyao, were present. The meeting was chaired by Niu Changyao, with Lu Gai as the recorder. After performing the ceremony, Chairman Niu first reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the Improvement Association takes all citizens of the township as members, is guided by the People's Education Center, manages the township's public funds, increases private economic prosperity, and pays special attention to supporting the most distressed people so that they can achieve economic development. They strive to find the most precise and appropriate methods to solve the necessary burdens of rural improvement. This type of organization is still a pioneering effort, and he hopes that all members will work hard to promote the association's affairs and seek the happiness of themselves and the public. Next, he introduced Wu Zhihui, who gave a speech, stating that today he came from the bustling city and was able to see the beautiful fields of your hometown, which made him feel relaxed. However, he still saw a lack of artificial modification in this natural landscape, so the natural resources that could increase the scenery and the economy have not been fully utilized. The main purpose of the Economic Improvement Association has been explained in detail by Mr. Niu. Life's necessities of clothing, food, housing, and transportation cannot be done without money, but the only way to solve the economic difficulties is to steal. This stealing is not stealing from people, but stealing from heaven, stealing from the Jade Emperor. We should compete with heaven and use heaven to become rich. Mr. Wu spoke in the Shanghai dialect, and his words were humorous. Niu Yongjian then gave a speech, explaining in detail the importance of the Economic Improvement Association. At the end, he also described the types of cooperative societies and their benefits. Then, Feng Zanyuan, an instructor sent by the Agricultural and Mining Department, spoke about the preparations for the Yutang Consumer Purchasing, Transportation, and Sales Cooperative and the methods for the future. The words are omitted for brevity. In the evening, at the same location, Huai Boming, the principal of the Qiangshu Vocational Middle School, led more than 30 students to perform operas such as "Good Son," and thousands of villagers participated, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Zhu Maocheng Requests Resignation</h3>
<p>Zhu Maocheng, Director of the Labor Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday, has spared no effort in planning and implementing matters related to improving the lives of workers and increasing industrial production since taking office in 1928. In the past two years, the National Government has sent him to Geneva to attend the International Labor Conference. This year, he was elected as the Vice President of the conference. He returned to China after the meeting last month, as reported in the previous newspaper. Because Zhu feels that it is often difficult to achieve the goals of his work, he specifically submitted his resignation yesterday and has come to Shanghai. The resignation is recorded below: Presenting the request to resign due to incompetence. I, Maocheng, was appointed as the Director of the Labor Department in April 1928. I have always been cautious and diligent. Fortunately, I have been able to avoid mistakes for more than two years. I have gradually drafted labor laws and regulations, established new labor villages, improved worker health, promoted labor education, and prepared for factory inspections. In the past two years, I have also been sent by the National Government to Geneva as the first government representative to the 12th and 14th International Labor Conferences. There are high expectations both at home and abroad. However, due to my incompetence, it is often difficult to achieve the goals of my work. If I continue to hold this position without making contributions, I will inevitably be ridiculed. Therefore, I request to resign from the position of Director of the Labor Department in order to avoid mistakes. In addition to the report on attending the 14th International Labor Conference, which will be submitted separately, all reasons for the request to resign are presented for your review and approval.</p>

Strict rejection.</p>
<p>The declaration of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union to support the strike at the Japanese-owned China Cotton Mill stated: The workers of the Japanese-owned China Cotton Mill demanded that the employers improve the situation, which was justified and reasonable. However, the capitalists of Japanese imperialism, relying on the protection of their country's warships, ignored the workers' demands. As a result, over three thousand pitiful workers had no choice but to adopt the negative method of striking as a last resort. For nearly fifty days, both sides have suffered significant losses, with the workers being the most affected. It is clear that the capitalists of imperialism are more cruel in their exploitation of workers' blood and sweat than domestic capitalists. Therefore, the methods of dealing with them are becoming increasingly difficult. Although various parties have been running around to mediate during the fifty days of the strike, it has ultimately been ineffective. We anticipate that victory will eventually belong to the labor side. As evidenced by the strike at the French-owned Water and Electricity Company, the employer was so stubborn, but eventually had to bow their head and accept the conditions. Moreover, what about the Japanese? However, the current plight of the striking workers and the ultimate victory still depend on the support and cooperation of all workers in Shanghai to persist to the end in order to achieve success. Our union fully supports all the workers of the mill and will not give up until victory is achieved. As long as we are alive, this determination will not change. We hope that all the workers in various industries will rise up together so that the capitalists of imperialism will know to be afraid and comply as soon as possible. The labor movement will be fortunate.</p>

<h3>The Fearless Spirit of Three Russian Children</h3>
<p>Planning to Steal a Sampan to Sail to Qingdao</p>
<p>Intercepted Mid-Journey by Water Patrol</p>
<p>Eight-Year-Old First Mate Missing. On the first day of this month, three Russian children, full of adventurous spirit and admiring the actions of the "Fifteen Young Heroes," stole a sampan intending to sail to Qingdao. Twelve-year-old Glavinsky appointed himself captain, and eight-and-a-half-year-old Lukonsky was appointed first mate. They cheerfully set out from the Huangpu River, but after traveling only a mile or two, they were intercepted by the water patrol and taken to the water patrol station. The Glavinsky child was sent back to his mother, and the other two children were allowed to return home on their own. However, the eight-year-old first mate has not yet returned home. His family reported the matter to the French police the next day and have been searching ever since, but without any news. The child is four feet tall, with chestnut-brown hair and brown eyes. He can speak Russian and English, and a little Chinese. Anyone who knows his whereabouts is asked to notify the French police.</p>
<h3>After Woman's Death, Resentment Remains, Spirit Tablet Thrown into Creek</h3>
<p>Caused Nephew's Death Due to Property Dispute</p>
<p>Long Dissatisfied by Family</p>
<p>Coffin Refused Burial in Ancestral Cemetery</p>
<p>Son-in-Law Greatly Angered, Vowing to Investigate Thoroughly. A woman from Pudong, surnamed Zhuang Zhang, recently suffered from dropsy and died on the ninth of this month at the home of relatives and friends in the city. Her coffin was moved back to her home in Pudong yesterday. Unexpectedly, her relatives refused to allow the coffin to be buried in the ancestral graves and threw the spirit tablet into the creek, causing a great uproar. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Old Grievances Resurface. Zhuang Xueqing, a Pudong resident residing east of Xiaoyangjing Temple and the Xiaoshi Bridge, was adopted by his aunt Zhang (i.e., Uncle Zhuang's wife) after his uncle, Jin Sheng, died in the sixth year of the Republic (1917).</p>
<p>She had only two daughters and no sons, so with the persuasion of relatives and friends, Zhuang was adopted by his aunt Zhang to inherit her property. At that time, she owned about ten mu of land. Later, Zhang's eldest daughter married, and her second daughter, Zhang Bao (now seventeen years old), was also betrothed to Xu Yuan, the son of a family from nearby Xupu. Zhang loved her second daughter and was not close to Xueqing. She gradually sold off almost all of the land. Finally, Zhang even wanted to take over the one-and-a-third mu of homestead land that Xueqing still held, leading to years of litigation. Xueqing eventually won the case. His second sister, Zhang Bao, also married on April 23 of this year. At that time, Xueqing, seeing that the land was already sold, was filled with grief and indignation. He actually swallowed opium and committed suicide on his sister's wedding day, causing a major uproar at the time. The family's refusal to bury Zhang's coffin this time stems from this incident. Died of Dropsy. As described above, the tragic events in the Zhuang family were caused by Zhang's harsh methods. The deceased is gone, and the living Zhang was not valued by her relatives. Zhang, holding all the property, also lived in her in-laws' home, which further fueled the family's resentment. They declared that Zhang's coffin should not be buried in the ancestral graves after her death. Zhang recently suffered from dropsy, and doctors in the Pudong area were unable to cure her. Therefore, she moved to the home of relatives and friends in the city, seeking famous doctors for careful treatment. Her son-in-law and daughter accompanied her day and night, hoping she would recover from the dangerous condition. However, the disease was incurable, and all medicines were ineffective. She finally died on the ninth of this month at her friend's house. Her son-in-law and daughter were busy with the funeral arrangements and chose yesterday as the day for the funeral.</p>
<p>Preventing the Burial. After Zhang's death, none of her husband's family attended, still angry that Xueqing had committed suicide because of Zhang. Zhang's funeral was solely borne by her son-in-law, who made grand preparations. The funeral procession set out yesterday, with those pulling the ropes all being Xu relatives. A plain carriage and white horse made it extremely lively. Military bands and all other ceremonial items were hired to lead the way. The coffin was transported by boat to the Pudong shore, then paraded through the main street of Lan Nidu for a week. Arriving next to the Zhuang family ancestral graves east of Xiaoyangjing Temple and the Xiaoshi Bridge, just as they were about to bury the coffin, unexpectedly, Zhang's husband's family refused to recognize Zhang's coffin as having the right to be placed in the old graves. Many people gathered and moved the coffin elsewhere. All of the deceased's spirit tablets and shrines were thrown into the nearby creek. When the news reached Xu Yuan himself and his parents, they were greatly angered. Xu reported the incident to the Third District Public Security Bureau, which dispatched police to the scene to investigate. The troublemakers had already dispersed, and only two old women were detained. According to their statements, one, surnamed Zhuang Zhang, aged sixty-six, was a relative of the deceased's husband's family, but because of her age, she did not participate in the disturbance. The other, surnamed Yang Zhang, aged sixty, was a neighbor of the Zhuang family and had come to attend the funeral, resulting in her mistaken detention. The district chief ordered them to be temporarily released pending further investigation to determine the truth.</p>
<h3>Woman Kneels and Pleads to Marry Police Officer</h3>
<p>Younger Sister Sentenced to Reformatory</p>
<p>Zhuang Ruixiang Imprisoned for Three Months. Zhuang Ruixiang, a dismissed police officer from Anhui, lived in the same house last year with Wang Dehong, a police officer from the Sandao Tou police station in Harbin. He seduced Wang's beloved daughter and sister into adultery and recently instigated her to flee. Officer Wang filed a criminal complaint against Zhuang, and the Special District Court has ordered the defendant and Aidi to be detained separately pending further interrogation, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Cheng proposed to continue the trial. Aidi insisted that she must marry the defendant and could no longer be subject to her father's control. She said that she had been repeatedly abused by her father and did not want to return with him. She showed her injuries during the hearing to prove her words were not false. Questioned about Zhuang Ruixiang's statement, Aidi said that she had quarreled with her father over marriage matters, resulting in abuse. She had twice thrown herself into the river, and he had rescued her both times. Therefore, she willingly devoted herself to him, and even if he refused, he could not change her mind. Judge Cheng said to the defendant, "You seduced her before, how can you live together afterwards? Even if she follows you, you can report it to the police." He then ordered Aidi to return home with her father. However, the woman firmly insisted on following the defendant and knelt and pleaded. Judge Cheng, seeing that the woman did not want to return home with her father, sentenced her to be sent to the reformatory for care. Zhuang Ruixiang, for attempting to seduce a woman under the age of twenty, was sentenced to three months of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Xikang Walking Group Renamed Kangzang Walking Group</h3>
<p>The Xikang Walking Group recently learned that Ms. Liu Manqing's special mission to Tibet had completely cleared up previous misunderstandings with the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama's plenipotentiary representative has also arrived in Beijing. Communication between Kang and Tibet will naturally be restored. The members of the group believe that Tibet is of the same race as us and serves as a shield for Sichuan and Gansu. Its survival is even more important than that of Xikang. Therefore, they decided to walk to Xikang and then directly to Darjeeling, Tibet, in order to accurately study diplomatic relations and various issues in Tibet. The group has now been renamed the Kangzang Walking Group to reflect the reality. The group's correspondence address is now No. 386 Baoshan Road, Zhabei. It is also heard that the group still needs to recruit several male and female members who can endure hardship and have scientific knowledge. Ms. Liu Manqing's efforts in traveling thousands of miles and making contributions in foreign lands are no less significant than those of Zhang Qian and Ban Chao. It is believed that compatriots here will be inspired to join. To view the group's regulations, please contact Mr. Huang Jingwan.</p>

<h3>Skinning of Frogs While Alive Leads to Arrest</h3>
<p>Frogs are animals that remove pests from rice fields and are beneficial to agriculture. Capturing and killing them has been strictly prohibited for a long time. However, the general populace is focused on filling their bellies, thinking that the meat is very fresh and delicious and they search for them in many ways. Once found, they skin them alive, season them with five flavors, and use them to flatter. Villagers, greedy for the high price, catch them when they see them, but do not dare to openly display them in the vegetable market, so they often sell them door to door. Yesterday, Liu Xing, a Cantonese from a store at No. 1777 East Westward Road, bought several frogs and skinned them alive for a feast. The bloody mess was discovered by a Chinese police officer from No. 1948, who, considering it too cruel and a violation of the prohibition, arrested Liu Xing and took him to the Huishan police station. After questioning him, the head of the police ordered Liu to pay a cash bail of one hundred yuan and released him, pending a summons from the Special District Court to punish him, as a warning to those who ignore the ban and harm living beings.</p>

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Bans Unauthorized Private Ferries in Yunzao Creek</h3>
<p>Boats Without Licenses Confiscated. The original public ferry in Yunzao Creek, Wusong, had poor equipment and was quite dangerous. After the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities issued regulations for managing ferries, a merchant named Shen Maodi complied with the regulations and applied to set up a ferry. He built a ferry wharf according to the regulations and was issued a license by the bureau to operate. Later, several people, including Shen Ajing, disputed the ferry business with Shen Maodi and became involved in litigation. They then used inferior wood to build a wharf and rented broken boats to set up a private ferry, competing with Shen Maodi's business. The Bureau of Public Utilities, upon receiving a report that Shen Ajing had set up a ferry without approval, hindering the legitimate ferry business and violating municipal regulations, sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau instructing the district to order them to cease operations. It is heard that the First Section of the Seventh District dispatched police to investigate and found the facts to be true. They confiscated the boats without licenses and summoned Shen Ajing and others to the station for interrogation.</p>

The cargo drifted in all directions, and there were cries for help, which were very tragic. The soldiers on duty at the fort heard the cries and saw the situation. They immediately reported to the Seventh District Public Security Bureau by telephone. District Chief Yang notified the Wusong Estuary Life Saving Bureau, which immediately dispatched a rescue boat to help. Together with the soldiers at the fort, they rescued the crew and towed the sunken sailboat near the beach. Most of the hundreds of bags of corn loaded on the boat had been lost. All four crew members were rescued, but one of them, named Guo Ligou, had died from inhaling too much water. More than one hundred bags of corn remained on the boat, which were transported to Shanghai by hired barge. The crew notified Guo's family in Song to collect his body.</p>
<h3>Ding Liang Sheng Commits Suicide by Drowning</h3>
<p>Ding Liang Sheng, a resident of Wujiang, used to run a yarn factory business. He quit last year after an incident and has been unemployed since. This time, he borrowed 100 yuan from his brother-in-law, Ling Bangyuan, as capital to start a burlap sack business. He went to various places in the interior to collect burlap sacks, transport them to Shanghai, and sell them to burlap sack shops. However, in less than half a year, his capital was completely exhausted. Shanghai's cost of living is high, and he could not make a living. He had no choice but to move back to his hometown of Wujiang with his wife. The day before yesterday, he hired a boat to transport his furniture and belongings. Ding and his wife went on the boat. Unexpectedly, when the boat was sailing on the river near Longhua Bay the day before yesterday, Ding ran from the cabin to the bow of the boat, jumped into the river, and committed suicide by drowning. His wife saw this, ran out and called for the boatmen to rescue him, but the tide was rushing, and he was washed away, so he was not rescued. His body was recovered only yesterday. Ding's wife had no money to buy a coffin for her husband. She begged for help from relatives, who bought a coffin for her husband. Ding's wife was so grief-stricken that she also wanted to jump into the river. After being comforted by relatives, she was sent back to her hometown of Wujiang.</p>

It is now learned that his wife, Wu Gao, reported to the Second District Police Station that Wu Delong had fabricated rumors to ruin their reputation because he had failed to borrow two yuan from their family. She had not committed adultery with anyone. Her aunt, Wu Tang, could testify to this. The Tang was her aunt's nephew and made a living selling soybean milk. Wu Delong often went to eat at their house without paying and never gave money. Their family had been very patient with him, but they did not know why he wanted to harm them. Now that he had fled, she had brought his aunt, Wu Chen, to the station for questioning. The district sent her to the District Court yesterday morning and ordered Dong Jianqing, the local tenth chief of the twenty-fifth bao, to report to the District Court.

<h3>Chen Zishan Engaged in Kidnapping and Extortion</h3>
<p>Sent to the Public Security Bureau for Interrogation. Xue Renquan, a tea steward from the Dingyuan steamboat, a native of Wuxi, over forty years old, lived at No. 2 Yongji Lane, Huayuan Shiqiao, Lan Nidu, Pudong. He had a son named Longbao, now thirteen years old, who was studying at school. Xue and his wife loved him very much. Longbao was active and often liked to go out and play. He had previously gotten lost twice and been held for ransom, but the family had managed to get him back. The day before yesterday afternoon, Longbao suddenly disappeared again. Xue searched everywhere but could not find him. While he was anxious, Chen Zishan suddenly arrived yesterday morning, holding a letter stating that your son Longbao had gotten lost and been taken in by someone and was now at Guanyin Pavilion somewhere in the city. Xue thought that his intentions were not good and that his son had been held for ransom twice before. He reported to the police, who brought Chen to the Third District Public Security Bureau for questioning. District Chief Zhang immediately ordered detective Yang Jinsheng to take Chen Zishan across the river. Longbao was found in the cabin of a small steamship outside Wumalu, Public Concession, and brought back to the district. According to Xue Renquan, forty years old, his son Longbao went missing once in June of last year. Soon, someone named Lao Sanbao came to report the news and told him to go to the Xinlong Teahouse at Dagou Bridge to negotiate. However, he did not see his son there. There were more than a dozen people who looked like ruffians, intending to extort money. He asked civil servants to plead with them, and it was resolved after paying five yuan for food and drink. In June of this year, he went missing for the second time. He received a letter instructing him to go to Gonghe Road, Zhabei, to negotiate. Fortunately, the troops there discovered it and slightly punished the kidnappers, so there were no losses. This time, it was the third time he had gone missing, and Chen Zishan came again with a letter to try to defraud them. Therefore, he brought him to the district for questioning. Chen Zishan, thirty-one years old, a native of Ningbo, who lived at No. 105 Guanyin Pavilion in the city and made a living selling bread, said that after 12:00 PM that night, he was passing by the Bund outside the Public Concession and saw the child sleeping on the grass. He was being driven away by a foreign constable, so he took him to the boat to sleep and asked him about his background. He learned his address and came to report the news with no bad intentions. Xue Longbao, thirteen years old, said that at 1:00 PM that day, he had taken one yuan from his father's pocket and went to the "Little World" to have fun. When he came out at 11:00 PM, there were no ferries at the riverbank, so he sat on the grass at the Bund outside Simaru. Then, that person (referring to Chen Zishan) led him to the boat, where someone was guarding him. District Chief Zhang considered that Chen Zishan had engaged in kidnapping and extortion and ordered that all the witnesses be sent to the Public Security Bureau for disposal yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Younger Sister Elopes After Failed Marriage Refusal</h3>
<p>Wang Chen, a woman from Yixing, residing at Shihuyao, Xiaoshadu, Huxi, forty-nine years old, works at a cotton mill for a living.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Her husband, Zhi Shi, died more than ten years ago. She has one son and one daughter. Her son, A Da, is already twenty years old and is studying in Nanjing. Her daughter, Xiaomei, is twenty-nine years old and also works in the factory. She was betrothed to the son of a Zhao family from the same village since childhood. Unexpectedly, after the woman came to Shanghai with her mother in 1927, she witnessed the prosperity of the sea and fell in love with the idea of free love. In recent years, she had often told her mother that she did not want to marry a rustic farmer in the countryside and wanted to break off the engagement. Her mother firmly refused because it was a matter of reputation. Unable to have her wish fulfilled, the woman went out to play with her sisters. Her mother occasionally forbade it, causing endless quarrels. Eventually, her mother gave up trying to control her. Unexpectedly, the Zhao family in her hometown had heard something and wanted to finalize the marriage because the groom was already grown up. They had chosen the fifth day of the tenth lunar month of this year as the wedding date and sent the original matchmaker to Shanghai the day before yesterday to inform the woman's family. The woman's mother was overjoyed, thinking it would be best to marry her off to avoid her being dissolute in Shanghai. However, when the woman found out, she cried silently and said nothing. Yesterday morning, when her mother went out to buy groceries, she suddenly saw that her daughter was missing, and all her clothes were gone. Her mother immediately searched everywhere, but there was no trace. She was very anxious and had no news until evening.</p>
<h3>Youth Attempts Suicide by Drowning in Wusong Fort, Rescued</h3>
<p>Reason Not Stated. At around 9:00 AM yesterday (the 11th), a young man, about twenty-four or five years old, wearing a gray serge suit, with a robust physique and a worried expression, looking unusually flustered, walked towards the wooden stairs on the reclaimed land of the Dredging Bureau in front of the coastal defense post at Wusong Wai Malu. He went down the wooden stairs and jumped into the river, attempting suicide by drowning. A wooden boat was docked nearby, and the crew saw this. They immediately tried to rescue the young man from the water. When asked why he wanted to commit suicide, he bowed his head and remained silent. The crew intended to send him to the police station, but the young man refused. He then went towards the eastern end of the coastal defense post. Later, the crew found a felt hat that the young man had left behind when he jumped into the water. A piece of white paper was pasted inside the hat with the words "Blind Man" written on it. However, it is not known why the young man attempted suicide by drowning.</p>
<h3>Female Student Unwilling to Marry Dull Husband</h3>
<p>Husband's Family Gathers Mob to Snatch Bride</p>
<p>Female Student Commits Suicide in Anger. Xu Chunsheng, a villager from Malu Town, Jiading County, is over forty years old. His wife, Hu, has a son named Gensheng, now eighteen years old, who usually helps his father farm and is quite content. However, Gensheng has been betrothed to Ren Di, the daughter of Zhang Minghai from Xishi, Nanxiang, by his parents since childhood. Ren Di is in the prime of her youth and has an elegant appearance. She is studying at a nearby girls' school, wearing a cheongsam and leather shoes, a graceful female student. Xu, eager to have a grandson, asked a matchmaker to choose a date for the wedding. Zhang relayed this to his daughter. Unexpectedly, Ren Di strongly opposed it, saying that she was young and ignorant at the time, and she did not recognize this marriage contract. She also said that her husband was crude and uneducated and that a phoenix should not roost with sparrows. If forced, she would rather die. The matchmaker was very alarmed and reported back to Xu. Xu knew that the matter would be difficult to accomplish but was unwilling to give up. He gathered more than ten relatives and friends and went to Nanxiang by boat the day before yesterday. They waited along the way. When Ren Di passed by on her way to school, they rushed forward and pulled her onto a pre-hired rickshaw, intending to drag her away. However, there were many pedestrians on the street who saw a fashionable female student being snatched away and suspected it was a kidnapping. They shouted loudly. At that time, Xu and others were afraid and fled in all directions. After being frightened, Ren Di was filled with anger and immediately returned home to inform her parents. Zhang was also extremely angry and wanted to resolve the matter through legal means. However, Ren Di, feeling that she had been humiliated and had lost face, hanged herself yesterday morning without anyone knowing. Fortunately, the maid discovered it and saved her. Although her relatives have tried to comfort her in every way, she still looks depressed all day long.</p>
<h3>Forgery of Receipts for Unpaid Debts</h3>

During the court hearing, Wu presented a receipt from Pu Wanxing indicating that the debt had been cleared, claiming that the payment had been made long ago. Pu Liankui accused Wu A-yi of intending to evade the debt and forging the receipt, constituting a criminal offense. Consequently, Pu Liankui filed a criminal lawsuit against Wu A-yi at the local court's prosecutor's office, also implicating Wang Jingyuan, the owner of the Fangbang Bridge Glass Store, for forging documents and seals, demanding a thorough investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Lei Renlong conducted a preliminary hearing and found the accusations to be substantiated, ordering Wu A-yi and Wang Jingyuan to post bail separately pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Woman Criminally Accuses Brother of Embezzling Inheritance</h3>
<p>A woman, Xu Jinggen, retained a lawyer to represent her in court, criminally accusing her brother, Xu Liangqi, of embezzling inheritance. Yesterday, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff had previously married into a certain family, but due to irreconcilable differences, they divorced. Since then, the plaintiff had been living in hardship. Recently, she discovered that her brother had sold a piece of ancestral land of approximately 1.8 mu located within the Twelfth District without her consent. When she confronted him, he ignored her. This conduct constituted embezzlement, and she requested an investigation and that the defendant surrender the proceeds of the land sale to the court for equitable distribution. Xu Jinggen stated that the land sold by her brother was actually communal property, and that she owed debts of 2,500 yuan. Someone had suggested that her brother pay off her debts, but he refused, leading to the lawsuit. The defendant, Xu Liangqi, also retained a lawyer, who argued that the land was sold to pay off debts after their mother's death, not for the defendant's personal use. Furthermore, the case was entirely civil in nature, and the plaintiff's allegations did not comply with the litigation law, requesting dismissal. Judge Zhu ruled that the case be transferred to the civil court for hearing.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing of Jardine Matheson Cotton Theft Case</h3>
<p>Regarding the theft of 160 small bales of cotton from the warehouse of Jardine Matheson's yarn factory, it was previously reported that Detective Jin Yangwu discovered the stolen goods in front of Wang Xianji Yarn Shop on Qingyuan Street, Guangdong Road, and while questioning Cai Yinlong, who was transporting the goods, a man named Shen invited Detective Jin to a restaurant, attempting to bribe him. Detective Jin apprehended Cai, while Shen escaped. Later, the stolen goods were seized from Wang Xianji's shop, and Wang's wife, Wu, was also detained and handed over to the special district local court. Wang Xianlin subsequently surrendered himself, and was ordered to be detained, while Cai and Wu were each released on bail of 100 yuan pending further investigation. It was previously reported that Detective Jin subsequently apprehended another accomplice, Chen Lilu from Zhenjiang, and recovered 40 bales of the stolen cotton yarn from the Yitai Socks Factory on Gongguan (Avenue Edward VII) in the French Concession. Yesterday morning, Wang and others were brought to court, where Judge Ge continued the hearing. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that Wang Xianlin and Chen Lilu had both committed offenses several years ago and should be severely investigated. Detective Jin reported that Wang Xianlin had claimed the cotton yarn was purchased from Sun Weisheng on Yuezhou Road. Upon investigation, Sun had already fled. Chen Lilu confessed that he introduced Sun to Wang Xianlin to sell the cotton yarn, totaling 144 bales, and that he received a commission of ten cents per bale. Xu Jinpu, a driver from the Sancha Xin Automobile Company on Broadway (Daming Road), testified that he transported the cotton yarn from the riverside on Jungong Road in Yangshupu to Wang's yarn shop by car. Wang, Chen, and two others hired the car, and the cotton yarn was taken from a boat. Wang Xianlin paid the transportation fee and refreshments, totaling 15 yuan. Wang continued to insist that the yarn was purchased from Sun Weisheng, while Cai Yinlong and Wang Wu had been released on bail and failed to appear in court. After arguments by the defendant's lawyer, Chen Tingrui, the court ordered Wang and Chen to be remanded in custody and ordered the defendant's lawyer to notify Cai and others to appear for a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>Investigation into Trafficking of a Child</h3>
<p>Wang Linqing, a rickshaw puller residing at No. 6 Gaoshou Lane in Zhabei, had a seven-year-old son named Xiao Erzi who often played in the lane and was friendly with Chen Xiao Wuzi, who ran a sundry stall. On the Zhongyuan Festival of the lunar calendar, Xiao Erzi suddenly disappeared, and Chen Xiao Wuzi was also absent from the lane. Wang's wife, Wang Gu, became suspicious and paid attention to Chen's movements. When Chen reappeared a few days ago, Wang Gu seized him and reported him to the Second Precinct of the Fourth District. Chen Xiao Wuzi confessed that he tricked the child into buying candy with six copper coins and took him to Sun Dalianzi's house, where Sun and his wife, Sun Zhang, sold him for 20 yuan, which they split. The whereabouts of the child were unknown. The police dispatched officers to arrest Sun Dalianzi and Sun Zhang, but the couple denied the accusations. As the case involved child trafficking, they were handed over to the local court for investigation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Jing'an Temple Police Continue to Apprehend Robbers</h3>
<p>Tao Afu and other detectives from the Jing'an Temple police station, along with Western detective Logan, previously apprehended seven robbers: Wang Zhengyuan, Ji Wenxue, Chen Zirui, Yang Baozhang, Liu Jinshi, Zhu Shuchen, and Jin Wenfeng, detaining them for investigation into their various crimes. Based on the robbers' confession that Liu Defu, a Jiangbei native residing at No. 3348 Robert Road, was also an accomplice, they secretly went to the address the other day and arrested Liu. Yesterday morning, Liu and the others were brought to the special district local court, where Judge Wu interrogated them and ordered them all to be detained for further investigation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Passing of Madam Ma, Mother of Ma Junwu</h3>

<h3>Judgment Announced in Chen Shifu's Lawsuit to Recover Land Deeds from Liang Huizhai</h3>
<p>Liang Huizhai, a Cantonese compradore of the German firm De Foe &amp; Co. on Sichuan Road, absconded two years ago due to significant debts. The firm sued Chen Shifu, Liang's guarantor, in the Former Provisional Court. Chen Shifu claimed that the land deeds Liang had deposited with the firm as collateral, covering more than three mu of land, were loaned to him, so he retained lawyer Zhang Deqin to participate in the lawsuit, requesting an audit. Lawyer Shen Yuesheng, a certified public accountant, was appointed and determined that Liang owed De Foe &amp; Co. over 66,000 taels, and Chen's guarantee liability was limited to approximately 26,000 taels. After the accounts were verified, the special district local court continued the hearing, but Liang remained absent. The plaintiff's lawyer, Wei, and Chen Shifu's lawyer, Zhang Deqin, completed the final arguments the other day, and the presiding judge ruled in favor of the plaintiff.</p>
<h3>Problem Arises from Garbage Disposal</h3>
<p>Wu Jinlin, who runs a barber shop in the Second Precinct of the Second District, located within the Wenmiao Road area, and his wife, Wu Lu, reported to the Second Precinct of the Second District that Tian Hongshun from Danyang dumped garbage in front of their door yesterday. When confronted, Tian Hongshun allegedly struck Wu Jinlin and his wife Wu Lu on the head, causing severe injuries. Under questioning by Chief Guo, it was confirmed that Wu Jinlin and his wife had sustained head injuries. According to Tian Hongshun, Wu Jinlin came to his work area with an axe, shouting and cursing, and insisted that he had dumped garbage. He claimed that he accidentally injured Wu while trying to take the axe away. Chief Guo, finding conflicting accounts from both parties, ordered them to be sent to the local court for hearing.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Provisional Meeting of the Accountants' Association</h3>
<p>Discussion of the Industrial and Commercial Bank and Liquidation Procedures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Accountants' Association held a provisional emergency meeting yesterday afternoon. The following committee members were present: Zhao Zuwei, Xu Yongzuo, Jiang Wanping, Xi Yushu, Jiang Xinzhao, Ye Danian, Pan Zhaobang, Wang Haifan, Xu Guangde, Sun Zhongyao, Bei Zuyi, Zhou Zengkui, Pan Xulun, Wang Zikang, and fourteen others. Wang Haifan chaired the meeting, and after formal greetings, the chairman reported on a letter from lawyer Zhang Yuji regarding the liquidation of the Industrial and Commercial Bank. The special district court appointed both Chinese and foreign liquidators, with different titles. Several questions were raised regarding both Chinese and Western practices, requesting clarification. It was determined that the liquidation of the Industrial and Commercial Bank was a significant matter that attracted the attention of both Chinese and foreign individuals. The liquidation procedures should be handled seriously in accordance with Chinese law, and the matter was significant for the accounting profession. Therefore, a provisional meeting was convened for joint discussion. Committee members Xu Yongzuo, Jiang Wanping, Xi Yushu, Jiang Xinzhao, Xu Guangde, and others successively expressed their views. Regarding the rights of liquidation and jurisdiction, they all advocated for a long-term and serious study, and the following methods were decided upon: (1) The liquidation procedures should comply with the Company Law and the General Principles of the Civil Law, which clearly stipulate the requirements. An official letter should be prepared to suggest to the special district court that the titles of liquidators should be corrected and uniformly referred to as liquidators, in order to uphold the law and maintain sovereignty. (2) The original approval orders from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Municipal Government regarding the correction of liquidation titles and methods should be published in newspapers for public awareness, in order to emphasize the authority of the law. (3) Lawyer Zhang should be answered based on the previous resolution. The chairman put the above items to a vote, and they were all passed unanimously. The meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Tenants of Yong'an Lane on Haining Road Seek Help</h3>
<p>The United Association of Tenants of Yong'an Lane on Haining Road, Henan Road, submitted a petition to the Chinese Ratepayers Association yesterday seeking assistance. The original petition stated (excerpt omitted): The petitioners have been renting houses in Yong'an Lane on Haining Road for many years. The houses originally belonged to the New Sassoon &amp; Co., but in July of this year, the management was transferred to the Kung Ho &amp; Co. Upon taking over, they immediately changed their previous attitude and exerted pressure in every way. They threatened to demolish the houses, forcing an 80% rent increase. Then, they falsely promised to extend the leases for five years, inducing all tenants to agree. To ensure their residence, the petitioners reluctantly accepted these harsh terms. Unexpectedly, after collecting the rent, they suddenly reneged on the agreement and notified each tenant to vacate the premises within twelve months, immediately ordering them to sign contracts. The petitioners agreed to the 80% rent increase solely to extend the leases. Now, the company is increasing the rent drastically and ordering them to move out, which is unacceptable and would cause immense losses. They have repeatedly sent letters requesting an extension for relocation, but the company has ignored them. Recently, they have intensified their actions by posting notices, ordering them to move out by the end of this month, threatening to demolish the houses if they do not comply. The petitioners are mostly weak and ordinary people, and if forced to move out, they will inevitably become homeless. Therefore, they urgently submit this petition, requesting the association to provide assistance and to inform the Shanghai Municipal Council to strictly prohibit the company from demolishing the houses privately. All rental disputes should be subject to legal judgment to protect the lives and homes of the people. They await further instructions with utmost urgency.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>Having read the news item in the "Local News" column of your esteemed newspaper on September 8th regarding the letter from the Citizens' United Association urging the British firm Jardine Matheson Insurance Co. to expedite insurance claim payouts, we find that many of the assertions contained therein are untrue, which are misleading and harmful to our firm’s good name. For this reason, we have enclosed a copy of our reply to the association, and we would be grateful if you would publish it in your newspaper so that the public will not be misled.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson Insurance Co.</p>
<p>Enclosed Reply Letter:</p>
<p>To the Preparatory Committee of the Citizens' United Association of the Special Municipality,</p>
<p>We acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th of this month, and we have duly noted the contents. Regarding the case of the fire at the Hanlun Silk Weaving Factory in Hangzhou, if we do not make the full payment, you will publish the facts in the newspaper and warn the Chinese public not to insure with our company in the future. These statements contain threats. We had already seen news of the fire in the newspapers two days before receiving your letter. We find it regrettable that you published untrue information and threatening language in the newspaper without proper verification, which is illegal. Our company is not an insurance company, but rather an agent. We have already hired someone to conduct a detailed investigation of the matter, and demanding compensation is not justified. According to the insurance regulations, if a dispute arises between an insurance company and a policyholder regarding compensation, it may be submitted to arbitration, which is well known to all. We have repeatedly requested that the Hanlun Silk Weaving Factory submit to arbitration, but the factory has not yet agreed. We have now decided to appoint an arbitrator and notify the factory to do the same. If the factory does not appoint an arbitrator within two months to jointly arbitrate, we will appoint our own arbitrator to conduct the arbitration in order to reach a proper resolution. We respectfully inform you of the above.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson Insurance Co.</p>

<h3>Industrial Rationalization (Continued) - Cheng Zhenjun</h3>
<p>However, under special circumstances, employees should also consider the actual situation and the decline in business, which cannot be remedied by the efforts of a single company, and make concessions. For example, the wages of German coal and iron workers were recently reduced by 7%, and the salaries of European employees of South Seas rubber companies were reduced by 20%. Employing specialized personnel to study various designs and improvements is an essential task for large companies, and only large companies have the ability to do so. Specialized personnel require partial equipment and opportunities to compare and discuss the results and methods of their research with experts in the same field, and to benefit from the exchange of knowledge and experience. This method of cooperation includes the exchange of publications, convening conferences for discussion, establishing joint research associations, and sending personnel to each other's company's laboratories to participate in research. This is all to promote the rational advancement of knowledge in order to solve various practical problems in business, and to enable those responsible for future economic development to inherit and carry forward this continuous learning. This is a matter of great significance. Our country's major companies generally lack this. The former Dayou Electrical Company in Hangzhou, with a capital of 2 million yuan, only employed one engineer with a monthly salary of 120 yuan. No wonder its consumption was high and its business did not progress. It should be understood that the cost of employing experts for research can be more than compensated for by the improvements in the business. Moreover, our country's industries are still in their infancy and rely on the collection of regulations and methods from various countries for reference and as a shortcut to industrial development. Entrepreneurs must not be timid and afraid to act. Moreover, when we look at the history of the development of companies in various countries, we know that the development of any business, large or small, comes from research, and research is endless. The function of rationalization is to show us that there are endless opportunities for progress in the economic field, waiting for us to bravely move forward and continuously acquire them. Among rationalization methods is what is called simplification, which is also very important. Simplification is a method of reducing unnecessary changes in industrial products and saving consumption. Because many companies' general commodities are confusingly different, without restrictions on form, size, or pattern. On the factory side, various different machines and talents are required to manufacture them. On the store side, various colors must be prepared, but they are difficult to sell, and a part of the capital is stranded. This is a great waste of social economy. For thousands of years, no one in our country has paid attention to it, but simplification is a sharp tool to eliminate this great waste. The United States first invented it, and many countries have gradually adopted it with remarkable results, and everyone is overjoyed. I will briefly describe its process. When Mr. Hoover, the current President of the United States, was the Minister of Commerce and Industry, he saw the necessity of simplification, so with the government's attitude of never profiting in the middle, and with the various investigation reports obtained by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry as the basis of the research, he called various industries to hold meetings in stages, so that they could unite and deeply study the many losses and inconveniences caused by the large number of the same items, the uneven sizes, and then publicly determine their retention, with the entire industry and social economy as the target. The Bureau of Standards added a simplification section to specialize in the matter. All people in the industrial sector deeply felt the seriousness of this loss, and this method was indeed the only way to save the shortcomings. Therefore, they worked together to simplify the complicated products through various organizations and meetings and establish a mutual agreement. This mutual agreement does not need to be approved by the government, because the industrial sector considers the permanent benefits of the whole and is able to maintain it. In terms of the number of items and styles reduced in various industries, proportionally speaking, it is about 40% to 90%. Although our country's industry is still in its infancy, how can this loss in each industry be calculated each year? Just take building materials as an example, the size of the wood is different, and the form of the bricks and tiles is different, so that wood companies and brick factories accumulate a lot of goods. Other similar manufactured goods are also numerous. Simplification is also necessary in China, and its method can not only save the past industry, but also avoid the same mistakes in the future expansion of industry. A method that is extremely relevant to simplification and has a more significant effect is standardization. Standardization has a wide range, and standards are morality, behavior, and consistency of written language are the standards of the new literature. The objects purchased by government agencies in various countries must be in accordance with the prescribed standards. All of these, whose facilities have a tendency to Datong, can be named as standardization, and industrial standardization is often carried out in four steps. The first step is to do it in a company, the second step is to do it regionally for special industries by commercial associations or industrial associations, etc., the third step is to do it with the scope and nature of the country, not limited to one industry. Before the European War, there was only the British Engineering Standards Association in one place N. Until the end of 1928, there were 24 organizations in various countries in the world. The fourth step is to jointly establish an international standards association at the international level ANTEVDATIOALSTANDARDSASSOCIATION, which was held in London in November 1927, and has now moved to the Zurich office in Switzerland (still incomplete).</p>

<h3>Business News</h3>
<p>The Continental Aviation Corporation proclaims that its passenger planes regularly travel between Los Angeles, Denver, Atlanta, Dallas, Fresno, and San Francisco. According to reports, a three-engine Ford transport plane flew 74,000 miles in three and a half months. This plane is a four-atomic transport aircraft, carrying eleven passengers, equipped with three Pratt &amp; Whitney engines. It flies an average of eight hours per day, and the engines are replaced every 350 hours of flight. The average flying speed is 90 miles per hour, but the plane has room for speed increase. Before flying in the West, this plane was used by Eastern pilots. Although the plane has flown a significant number of miles, it has not been damaged, they say.</p>
<p>The new "Flower World" amusement park, located at the former site of the Municipal Council on Nanjing Road, proclaims that since its opening a few days ago, it has been very crowded with visitors due to its novel content and layout, and the superior quality of its entertainment. The park's manager, Cheng Xiqing, and associate manager, Wang Wenyang, in order to arouse audience interest, are sparing no expense and have specially commissioned the Da Jing Opera troupe to perform a new historical Song Dynasty play, "Qin De Xiang Lian." All costumes and props in the play are newly made, and the plot is intricate and worth seeing. It is scheduled to premiere this Saturday night. The park's tickets are only sold for 20 cents of small silver coins, and there are special gifts, making it extremely convenient and affordable. For details, please refer to the "World Daily" newspaper, they say.</p>
<p>The Lincoln Motor Company proclaims that in the Detroit area, two police cars have collectively traveled the distance from the Earth to the Moon Palace. Both cars were manufactured by this company and are still in operation. One of the cars has traveled 265,000 miles, and the other has traveled 250,000 miles. The distance from the Earth to the Moon Palace is only 238,840 miles, and the total mileage of these two cars has exceeded this number. In July of this year, these two police cars competed with two other Lincoln cars. The Lincoln cars traveled a similar distance, approximately from 200,000 miles to 300,000 miles. The speed was very high during the competition, but the police cars were used 24 hours a day, averaging 4,000 miles per month, they say.</p>
<p>The Han Li Company proclaims that the Zhongling printing press is a newly invented, special domestic product with proven printing performance. As more and more people use the company, the business is flourishing. Yesterday, a prominent businessman from the three northeastern provinces, Mr. Wu Xiangchen, came to Shanghai to purchase and transport over a hundred Zhongling presses back to Harbin for promotion and trial. Unexpectedly, once advertised, there was a large demand and the machines were quickly sold out. Mr. Wu has a high reputation in the northeastern provinces, and is helped by the military, political, and educational circles. Now, they are requesting Wu to purchase and transport a large batch back for sale. Wu believes that since this machine can be sold in large quantities, it would be better to set up a factory nearby for local manufacturing, and establish a large-scale company to attract more customers. Yesterday, he sent a letter to this company outlining his plans for the Zhongling. After receiving the letter, the head of the sales department, Mr. Zhong Yu, took the Dalian Maru on the 4th of this month to develop business in the provinces outside the Guanwai (Shanhaiguan Pass), they say.</p>
<p>The United Educational Supplies Company, located at the intersection of Wuma Road and Gongpan Street (61 Guangdong Road), proclaims that its company exclusively handles global educational supplies. The beauty of the goods and the low prices are unmatched in the country. Therefore, since its establishment, the business has been quite prosperous. Recently, a three-week autumn sale started on September 8th. The day before yesterday was the first day of the company's sale, and the customers were so crowded that the entrance was like a market. The downstairs retail department is offering a 10% discount across the board. The wholesale and sale departments are located upstairs, especially the sale department, which has exceptionally low prices and new and beautiful products. For example, a box of 102 Huatuomen ink is only sold for $3.30, which would cost double that at other stores. Selling at such a low price regardless of cost is a great sacrifice for the educational community, they say.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>The Paris Grand Theatre proclaims that starting today, it will be showing the latest and most valuable production from the Wu Fa Company, "Romantic Actress." The opulence of the background and the romantic and humorous performances are truly unprecedented. Compared to "Spiritual and Carnal Conflict," the former is a great comedy while the latter is a great tragedy. The former wins with calmness, and the latter wins with liveliness. They are different songs played with equal skill, they say.</p>
<p>The Brahma Palace Cinema on Avenue Sainte Marie proclaims that the cinema is located inside the Brahma Palace Garden Hotel, which is quiet and clean. The ticket prices are very cheap, only 20 or 40 cents of small silver coins day and night.

<h3>Talking About Chinese Elementary Education From A Fact</h3>
<p>— Xi Tao</p>
<p>Several new rains have washed out a clear and cool autumn, and a refreshing autumn atmosphere has unconsciously emerged in the air and on the ground. If we pay attention, we can see some lovely young siblings on the smooth roads of the residential area where autumn light plays, carrying their schoolbags and lightly moving their agile little legs, leisurely moving forward, telling us the beginning of the new semester and the fun of school life, which is playing a role in his little heart. A picture of classmates playing in the campus is unfolding before his eyes.</p>
<p>Such scenes often move me. When I meet elementary school students going to school on the road in the morning and you smile at them, they often return your smile, and after five or ten steps, they will turn their little faces to look at you a few more times. This will inevitably make you stop and watch him disappear into the morning glow.</p>
<p>If someone were to ask about the method of observing the rise and fall of a country or a nation, I dare say that this phenomenon of elementary school students going to school, which is expressed on the road every morning and evening, must be one of them. As for the quality of children's education, it goes without saying. If there is some truth in this statement, then it is truly a problem in our noble country.</p>
<p>Chinese elementary education does not seem to be taken seriously. Take a small elementary school as an example. There are countless problems that can be pointed out. However, these problems worthy of criticism are often not regarded as problems by those concerned.</p>
<p>In the cool weather of the evening, I chatted with my younger siblings about the interesting things at school. One of them is what I want to talk about now. When I put pen to paper to describe it at this moment, I still feel endless discomfort lingering in my heart.</p>
<p>My younger sister said, "There is a classmate in our school who steals other people's things, such as fountain pens, pencils, textbooks, exercise books... He steals everything. Once, the teacher saw many small packages hanging on the trees in the campus. When he asked someone to take them down, they were all well wrapped. Each package was labeled 'The teacher takes my things,' 'Things from my son,' 'Classmates take my things will become turtles.' When he opened them, they were all stationery that the classmates had lost. The teacher was very angry when he saw it, so he tied the classmate up and hung him on the tree, and hung those things on his body, letting the classmates watch and laugh. Later, he notified his mother to take him back and told him not to come to school again. His mother is a widow and only gave birth to him, and there is also a grandmother who loves him very much. He usually wears Western suits and has pocket money. When his mother found out, she rushed to the school and begged the teacher to beat him, and to deal with him in any way, only hoping not to expel him. The teacher would not agree no matter what. In the end, he was expelled. After the classmate was expelled and went home, the classmates ridiculed him when they met him on the road. Later, even students from other schools found out and laughed at him in the same way. His mother sent him to another school, but the other school refused to take him in. Now his clothes are worn out and he looks much uglier."</p>
<p>"Didn't you see him take the stolen things to use himself or sell them for money? Why did he steal them and wrap them up and hang them on the tree?" I asked. "No, he has plenty of money," he replied.</p>
<p>In this simple question and answer, my mind is only filled with a naughty and lively teenager, but when I think of him being hung on a tree and laughed at by the whole school, and even expelled, ridiculed by people in society whether they know him or not, cut off from the opportunity to receive education, and losing the love of his dearest mother and grandmother, I can't help but feel terrified and compassionate for him.</p>
<p>I am not a psychologist or an educator, so I dare not say for sure whether the above-mentioned teenager's behavior is due to a playful psychology, or an impulse to possess, or a hereditary thievery, or even some incurable evil nature... (If I have the opportunity, I would like to ask that brilliant teacher.) Regardless of whether he belongs to any of these types, or some other psychological abnormality, in short, since his wise teacher hung him up for public display and declared that he would never be admitted, it seems that there is no room for research. Why? Didn't he give him a criminal charge! A robber! Is he already a robber? The teacher used the most scientific? The most wonderful, the most profound, no, the most vicious method to show that he is a robber. Hundreds of elementary school students called him a robber in unison. The nearby students, and even those from other elementary schools, all recognized him as a robber. The dearest mother was also forced to regard him as a robber by outside pressure. Even if he does not really become a robber in the future, the word "robber" has definitely replaced his real name.</p>
<p>I seem to remember that a similar incident happened at a certain girls' school in Tokyo, Japan last year. A female student (about fifteen or sixteen years old) stole twenty cents from a classmate. Later, it was discovered on the windowsill. After the teacher reprimanded her, she was detained until evening and then notified her mother to take her back. The next day, the female student committed suicide by throwing herself into a river. The news was widely reported in various newspapers, which caused great criticism from society. The principal of the school, a certain lady who was a leader in the women's movement, made a sincere and painful self-criticism. The problem caused by this incident is not simply the death of a female student, but the educator's educational methods, educational attitude, and the responsibility that the teacher bears to the taught. It must be known that the pain suffered by a certain student from that time on is no less than suicide. Even if not, the teacher's educational methods and attitude are also a big problem.</p>
<p>Children are the key to the rise and fall of the nation's future, which is well known. The importance of elementary education is already self-evident. The educational administrative organs' review of teachers' qualifications, the repeated and serious review and training of party ideology teachers, all tell us that the authorities are paying attention to children's education. However, for the various aspects of the children themselves, such as problems above the forms of guiding and correcting children's physical and mental development, children's temperament and habits, etc., the fact that they are completely ignored in Chinese elementary schools is at least chilling for people who have children.</p>
<p>Finally, let us end this short essay by quoting a passage from Chekhov about elementary school teachers: "Speaking of teachers, they must be artists who love their vocation, but the so-called teachers in Russia are simply uneducated wandering crows, simply like exiles, teaching children from village to village. He is hungry, killed, and trembles all day long for fear of losing his daily rations. ... The police in the village, the rich merchants, the materialists, the protectors of the school, the members of the council, etc., wearing the title of school inspectors, never care about the improvement of education. ... It is ridiculous to give only a pittance of salary to those who educate others. The teacher wears tattered clothes, in the humid, windy and sunny school, trembling with cold, catching a cold, and suffering from laryngitis, rheumatism, tuberculosis and other diseases at the age of thirty or so. This is embarrassing, and we should be ashamed of it. Russian teachers live the life of hermits for eight or nine months of the year, and have no one to talk to, no friends, no books, no entertainment, which has gradually turned him into a fool. Moreover, if he entertains visiting colleagues, this will become a political figure! This is the language used by cunning people to intimidate fools. This is something that everyone is disgusted with. This is fooling people who are doing great and very important work... Every time I meet so-called teachers, I always feel ashamed for them, because of their cowardice, because of their poor clothes... I always feel that the misery of teachers is my fault."</p>
<p>Looking back at our elementary school teachers pulling rickshaws, catching and selling frogs, and selling paper money for the dead (all news published in the Shen Bao), and even committing suicide in various ways, which is often heard, what else can we say?</p>
<h3>Moonlit Night</h3>
<p>— Guangmei</p>
<p>Although it is the weather of early autumn, the Red Emperor (referring to the sun) with the transformation of the times, the trend of the trend, has invisibly reduced some of its majesty. Previously, the blood-colored morning dew in the early morning has not been seen for a long time. The demonstration of the cicadas that once flourished has disappeared. Young men and women in general are not as crazy as they used to be, competing to swim, go to parks or go for a drive. The swimming pools that were crowded with people have suddenly become desolate and deserted. Parks are of course no exception. Jiangwan Road, which has been praised by people, is not as crowded with cars and horses as it used to be. Many young men in suits are riding motorcycles, with a slender and long-haired girl in the back, speeding on the smooth asphalt road. These, these, seem to have become the past of the Republic of China in 1919. However, I, who am obsessed with nature, still can't bear to say goodbye to Yikou Park, which has not been interrupted for a night since summer.</p>
<p>It is obviously an autumn scene. More than half of the seats are empty, unlike in the past when you had to squeeze to sit on the grass. The lotus flowers in the pond have lost the fragrance and beauty of those girls. Ah, where did the good youth disappear? The yellowing of the leaves, although not clearly visible under the moon, but you can see that the shade is not as thick as before. Sometimes, pieces of fallen leaves drift past. The autumn insects chirp, playing natural music, especially the crickets that are easy to distinguish, singing the weaving song, "Tear down and wash, prepare winter clothes early." Everything shows us - autumn has come.</p>
<p>The easy passing of time often makes people unbearable to look back, and even dare not speculate about the future. In the past, ah, the loss of childhood innocence and liveliness can no longer be recovered or pursued. As for the future, I dare not even imagine it. From young to strong, and old, ah, what about studies, achievements, and career? What is contributed to the country? What is told to the parents to comfort them? These unknown mixtures gather in the heart, how can I not worry, yearn, and even be sad and hesitant? But, after all, what other way is there besides working hard? Time is always waiting for me. Tomorrow will be the first day of school again.</p>
<p>"Sister, tonight is our last day to visit the park this semester. Although I still have a few days before school starts, my sister has to go to school tomorrow!" My younger brother said sweetly and quietly, like the moonlit night, to me.</p>
<p>"Time passes too quickly, it's simply impossible to retain," I said in a tone that seemed to be complaining.</p>
<p>Tonight is a full moon, shining white on the earth. The sky street is like water, and the breeze blows on the body, not cold but warm. We are lying in the embrace of this great nature of maternal love, and we seem to be too happy. "How come most people don't know to come and enjoy it?" I thought to myself.</p>
<p>We are sitting behind a tree, and the moonlight shines through the cracks, dappled and interesting. My younger brother turned his head, "Sister, look, the lovely moon sister is peeking!"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's a pity that Mei and Su are studying hard, otherwise, it would be more interesting if there were more people."</p>
<p>A burst of piano sound and singing came from the side, a sharp and loud foreign woman's voice. I don't know why I am so aware of it. This is Beethoven playing his own song. It's just a pity that we siblings can't cry like the Shi sisters in Moonligth Sonata. We are basically laymen when it comes to music, but we love it very much. However, it is only blind worship.</p>
<p>"Sister, what are your thoughts when you listen? It's so beautiful, but in such an autumn moonlit night, it makes people feel sad,"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's why I haven't written half a word in the last ten days. I don't dare to write, and I'm always sentimental. In fact, I'm not a pessimistic person, so why am I so good at being sentimental in this autumn? It's really inexplicable, but my reason is still overcoming my emotions, and I will never write half a sad word, revealing the attitude of the weak, so as to flow into a passive, pessimistic, decadent, or even romantic state. Needless to say, these, these, are not allowed by the times, and are not allowed by strong and upward countries and nations. Moreover, I have always opposed that kind of whining without illness. Even if we talk about the artistic value, it is at most 'art for art's sake.' However, we are not allowed to wander in the art palace and the ivory tower. I've awakened. I know that you and I usually have the same consciousness, but I can't help but say these nonsense again. You ask me what I think? Brother, forget it. I can't forget my mother, who has been working hard for us all year round. The old lady loves us too much. She has suffered a lot and been ridiculed for our studies. The most unbearable thing is that she doesn't know how many gossips, unexpected criticisms, and slanders she has heard. Alas, the bad feudal social environment has given my mother many attacks and suffered unspeakable hardships, not only in terms of spirit, but also in terms of material. Alas, I don't know how we will repay that great and kind mother in the future. Therefore, even though I am so busy, I have not forgotten my mother for a moment. I pray secretly every morning, praying for my mother's health. Also, every time in the middle of the night under the moonlight, the moonlight shines directly on my bed, and I wake up from a dream, instinctively opening my sleepy eyes. Ah, the bright moon, the great and kind moon, isn't it our mother? A good love is broad and selfless, but a full moon is rare, and a crescent moon is the most common. If I encounter such a situation! Only half of the wreckage of the moon is left, weakly emitting some hazy faint light. Small stars sparsely surround it, and floating clouds cover the decaying remains from time to time. I would be so aware that the moon is still the mother, the small stars are like our sisters, and the floating clouds are the remaining forces of feudalism. The aging waning moon and the faint starlight are hated by the floating clouds like thorns, and they still attack or attack us from time to time. The moon, whose beauty is no longer there and whose body has been crippled by half, has no strength at all. The dim light seems to be struggling as much as possible to climb through the window screen to the bed. Dear mother, thankfully, she still has to steal a glimpse of her beloved daughter in the hard-working midnight. How can I not stir up my heart and arouse my sorrow? I can't help but feel sad and tearful. There is no phenomenon in the universe that is more tragic than this. Cry, cry to your heart's content... But, I don't say, 'Who can comfort me? I only hate who can comfort the moon.' Now, in this desolate moonlit night, fallen leaves are flying, and insects are chirping, and the only thing that touches me is to think of my mother... I am sad, and my younger brother shed tears before me. We were silent for a while, and then we talked about our eldest sister. She seems to be succumbing to the corrupt family of the old, trying to fight against the feudal evil forces, but finally can't break free. In the end, she can only make a desperate charge. Although her body is still there, her spirit has died a few times. We, who were weak and incompetent in our student days, couldn't help either. Alas, in short, our eldest sister sacrificed in this unknown way. We changed the topic and discussed ordering books for our younger siblings. At this time, we had stood up and were strolling.</p>
<p>On the quiet Jiangwan Road, there were few people and cars. The moon, like a bright mirror, shone all over the smooth ground. We were walking leisurely and chatting. Suddenly, we looked up and arrived at the railway in front of the school gate. "Sister, let's come here again before I move to school." "Okay, goodbye." The life that has been like a set pattern for a summer has also come to an end.</p>

<h3>Visiting George Bernard Shaw (2)</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>The Imitation of Voices</p>
<p>Now, before Shaw surprised me, he calmed down for a few minutes and imitated his own accelerating voice on a gramophone record. If he were willing to retry this in public, he would surely make a lot of money on a vaudeville stage.</p>
<p>'Yes,' he repeated, 'gramophone recordings are a great way to reveal one's true colors. Once, I asked Morley if he had ever made a gramophone record. He said, 'How dare I? I'm a thorough Londoner!'"</p>
<p>Shaw meant for me to note that one should speak naturally and not shout into a megaphone.</p>
<p>I said, 'Wasn't your own sound film quite successful?'</p>
<p>'Oh, I did my best,' Shaw replied. 'I did a lot of the work myself. I put that dialogue about Mussolini in to deliberately make them not show the film in public. But they showed it anyway, and I didn't care. I guess they made some profit from it, because not long after, two big trucks loaded with filming equipment came to my house. They asked me to make two more sound films, for eight hundred pounds each, but I turned them down.'</p>
<p>'Have you seen many sound films?'</p>
<p>'I've seen a few. One of them had excellent action and sound. I'm talking about the one Ramsay MacDonald made. He was superb; his actions were perfect. No one could match him, unless Gladstone were still around. He could also make perfect sound films,' Shaw said solemnly.</p>
<p>I think when Shaw's plays were first made into sound films, the playwright himself came forward to help with the production, undoubtedly.</p>
<p>I asked, 'Did you produce your own play *The Apple Cart*?'</p>
<p>'I interfered,' Shaw admitted. 'I often do that. I dare say the producers aren't afraid of my interference.'</p>
<p>Another topic Shaw and I discussed was the real method of writing, from the perspective of the author. I believe his advice would be much more useful to aspiring writers than what correspondence universities provide. However, to avoid offending a few excellent schools, I must state that no one has the opportunity to listen when Shaw pours words of wisdom from his head. What is said here is only a portion of his advice, not much is quoted, because I think readers should write for themselves. (Arnold Bennett often tells you what a difficult life it is!) Because I also think it is for the sake of patience to shine brilliantly, the early Shaw was shaped by this patience.</p>
<p>'I don't like the novels I wrote in my early years now,' Shaw told me, 'because they evoke in me the memory of being shackled to writing novels. I wrote novels to practice writing, setting myself the task of writing a few pages every day. No matter how tired I was, I had to finish the work, sometimes stopping even in the middle of a sentence. I think I wrote them just for the sake of writing. At that time, I didn't know that there was no need to worry too much about style. If I hadn't been so overly concerned about style at that time, perhaps the novels I wrote might have been better.'</p>
<p>So now it seems, Shaw had a foundation in novel writing techniques early on. He said, 'First, one must practice writing. Once you know your job, you don't have to worry anymore. In short, all you have to do is say what you want to say, without worrying about how to say it.'</p>
<p>Know Your Job</p>
<p>If Shaw wants to write a play, he can write it in the shortest possible time, because he knows his job. He also hopes that others know their jobs. 'Once, a man brought me the music he had written—"The Funeral March of Good Fortune,"' Shaw said. 'He told me that he had spent nine years writing this piece of music.' Shaw smiled, only Shaw could joke like that. He said, 'I told him, if this funeral requires nine years to compose, then I wouldn't want to hear it played.'"</p>
<p>I once told Shaw that what I most regretted was not seeing Mrs. Patrick Campbell perform in *The Second Mrs. Tanqueray*. The play was performed a few years before I was born, but from Shaw himself, I imagined it would be even more interesting than that performance. I still feel it's best that I didn't miss it. This is about an incident where Shaw, in a room full of people, was courted by the late dancer Isadora Duncan in bed. I have a book written after this woman's death. I remember Shaw once had dinner with her, and because she ate meat, Shaw scolded her as a meat-eater. This unexpected event was told to me by Isadora. Now it seems that even having dinner was a mistake.</p>
<p>Shaw wrote to me, 'I have never in my life dined with Isadora.'</p>
<p>So when I visited him, and mentioned this matter, my host told me a little-known and delightful thing, which was his only meeting with the famous actress.</p>
<h3>Interesting Statistics: Price Comparison Sixteen Years Ago</h3>
<p>— Junshan</p>
<p>Only Electricity Prices Have Decreased</p>
<p>The world's economic situation changes constantly and without any regularity. However, the increase in prices is almost an undeniable fact. The following table was prepared by Mr. Allard Smitb, Vice President of the Cleveland Trust Company in the United States, comparing prices in 1914 with those today. Although it uses the United States as a background, it is roughly the same.</p>
<p>The following are the equivalent prices sixteen years ago for goods worth one dollar today:</p>
<p>Common food 67 cents</p>
<p>Yams 44 cents</p>
<p>Beef 52 cents</p>
<p>Bread and milk 64 cents</p>
<p>Butter 82 cents</p>
<p>Eggs 97 cents</p>
<p>Clothing 62 cents</p>
<p>Furniture 52 cents</p>
<p>Tobacco 84 cents</p>
<p>Sugar beets 59 cents</p>
<p>Electricity $1.36</p>
<p>It can be seen that the prices of various goods have increased by double or two-thirds. Only electricity has decreased by a quarter. From this, we can also get a glimpse of the influence of modern civilization.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of British Shipping is Average</h3>
<p>— Junshan</p>
<p>British shipping has seemed more prosperous in recent months, but it cannot be said that the time to restore it to its previous state is not far off. If the current world situation can be improved, and if China, India, or Russia can become stable, then British shipping will surely develop greatly. However, based on the current situation, increasing the number of ships must be extremely cautious, so as not to supply more than is demanded. The tonnage currently out of service is already quite considerable.</p>
<p>According to the report of the London Shipping Association Registry, in the quarter before the end of June this year, there were 311 merchant ships under construction, with a total tonnage of 1,392,063 tons. This number includes shipyards in England and Ireland. This is a decrease of 223,930 tons compared to the previous quarter and a decrease of 61,843 tons compared to the same time last year. Of the 3,057,735 tons of merchant ships under construction worldwide as of June 30 this year, almost 45.5% were being built in the United Kingdom. However, this is still inferior to the pre-war level. In 1913, ships built in the United Kingdom accounted for 57% of the world's total. Experts believe that Britain is still able to achieve this result in such a difficult economic situation, and the future prospects are very promising.</p>
<h3>Germany Will Adopt Recording Telephone</h3>
<p>— Junshan</p>
<p>The German postal authorities are considering adopting the Writing Machine. The recording telephone is a newly invented machine that can automatically record conversations when the receiver is not available and does not increase the economic burden on users, so the general public hopes for its success.</p>
<h3>Recent Population Survey in Japan</h3>
<p>370,000 Unemployed</p>
<p>Tokyo News. According to the latest statistics from the authorities, the total population of Japan, excluding overseas residents, is 63,730,000, an increase of approximately 7.7 million people compared to 1920. In this decade, the average annual increase was approximately 754,000 people in the first five years and approximately 800,000 people in the last five years. Furthermore, as of the end of May, the total number of unemployed people nationwide was approximately 278,000.</p>
