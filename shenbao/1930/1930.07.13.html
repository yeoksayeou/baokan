<p>今日世人引爲和平前途之隠憂者。法意間之交涉。亦一端也。法外相白里安。雖亦承認意法邦交之緊張。然亦未嘗不力圖挽救冀以消滅此種險惡之形勢。最近聲明願於本年内暫停海軍造艦工作俾法意間交涉。得重開談判。仍歸和好。是誠法外長不得已之苦心。也竊謂當此世界財政同一困難之際。無論何。國皆當稍降其意氣稍戢其雄心。曲爲容隠以避免戰爭之危機。縱有好戰之國。受若何委曲。此時當亦俯首下心。以暫忍於一時。然而今觀意大利之主張。則尙未能必其如是也。據羅馬電稱。此間政界對於白里安暫停造艦工作之表示。頗覺冷淡。謂此議倘僅爲促進談判起見或可接受。而意報則仍一致聲斥法人之安全論。謂其欲遂稱覇歐洲之野心。且復高唱修改和約解除戰敗國之桎梏論。顯有見好德奥使法爲難之意。夫意報素爲墨索里尼之喉舌。意報如此。則意政府之意可知。總之墨索里尼之意。始終不信法西斯之軍隊。不足以征服歐陸。始終不信法西斯之經濟。不足以凌駕他邦。始終不信法西斯之主義。不足以打倒世界一切主義。故不問今日之世界潮流何如。環境如何。必欲逹我目的而後已。墨索里尼旣有此種思想。宜乎其對於白里安暫停造艦之聲明。漠然不顧。而法意間前途荊棘。遂亦未可料歟。</p>

<p>因取消在華勢力範圍一層、未能解决、致吾等協約、不能順利進行、雖予對勢力範圍一項、極願讓步、以便其他重要問題、可得順利之解决、但日政府處外交研究委員會内諸元老勢力之下、遲遲不發確切之回訓、予爲免去對本問題作枝枝節節討論起見、乃對藍氏言明、日政府不願贊同僅日美兩國廢除在華勢力範圍、蓋信此種廢除、應由在華享有利益之列强一致宣布也、然日政府之躊躇不即贊同取消勢力範圍遂引起美國官方之疑心乃反對於協約中用（無上利益）數字、此殊令人抱憾者也、</p>

<p>少年老伯。我實在愛你的女兒。我爲了伊。可以赴湯蹈火。任是立刻送命。也一千二百個願意。</p>
<p>老人　你扯謊我不相信。</p>
<p>少年　我完全出於誠意。怎麽說是扯謊。</p>
<p>老人　因爲我當初向我老妻求婚時也曾說這一套話。所以我知道是扯謊。</p>
<p>干求者　先生。剛纔我說了許多的話。有擾淸神眞的是對不起得很。</p>
<p>大紳士　好在我一逕在這裏想别的事情你剛纔說了些甚麽話。我一句也没有聽得。</p>
<p>醫生　你的病尙無起色。我只須再來五六次。就有功效。這一張醫藥費的賬單。請你過目。</p>
<p>病者　目前請不要給我看。一看之後。恐怕病又加重起來。以後的五六次請你也免了吧。因爲你多來一次。反使我的病加重一分。</p>
<p>甲　你對Ｄ先生說。每年有九千九百九十九元的收入。。爲甚麽不老老實實說了一萬元。這一塊錢的上下有甚麽關係呢。</p>
<p>乙　我若是脫口便說一萬元。他一聽了這個（萬）字以爲數目極大。不免要吃嚇。不如少說一些。免得駭人聽聞。</p>

<p>齅即嗅。又作臭。係陸地感。覺亦近十一感覺。爲外感覺之一。由單細胞生物之感觸性演化而成。臭官單簡。其神經居鼻樑上部。直逹棕色之黏膜。承受化學性之氣體刺激。嗅之種類僅六。藥·花·果·脂·朽·魚是也餘皆混合。氣如狐臭係焦朽之混合焦腥係朽脂之混合嗅之功用。爲偵探環。境尋求食。物報告危。險防衛滋養且關係傅種。牡藉嗅識。牝不善嗅之動物。雖生不蕃。以此嗅覺與愛情。一若車之兩輪。鳥之兩。翼不可須臾離焉。今請畢余。說夫人之體氣。各依其民族年齡。個别而逈。異有山羊。氣乾菓氣。大蒜氣。乳油酸氣。麝香氣等等。西施·楊貴妃·婕妤·荀令·香妃所以得寵於君王貴人者。以其體香襲人。也體臭者雖至親好友。僉將退避三舍。爲絕交離婚之一大原因。又戒慾男子之體氣。較常人濃厚。有人憑是辨其貞潔。女子在靑春期之嗅覺發逹特甚。鼻血症多發現於斯期。故西諺有（靑春流鼻血爲戀愛之表徵）一語。鼻孔奇臭。噴嚔感冒。每受愛情之激動而暴發。革臭能使兩性增加愛情。變態心理。不少此項事實之記載。人每見所歡之鞋而心動。蓋鞋多自革製。者愛鞋即愛革臭之變相。人類何獨愛革臭。某心理學者謂因其類性臭也。花香起快。感又能引人情緒。白色花梔子·晚香玉·百合花魔力最大。是以贈花爲艷史上不可少之一頁。女子對心愛之。花輒閉目深呼。戀戀</p>

<p>英國名小說家柯南道爾（ＡrtherConanDoyle）以著作偵探小說得名。其所作福爾摩斯偵探案小說集百數十種。莫不膾灸人口。轉譯成十餘種方言。吾國小說界亦多有譯其著作者。其盛名。凡讀偵探小說者。固莫不知之也。不幸惡耗傅來。據云柯氏已於本月七日（星期一）上午九時十五分在其克羅堡Ｃrowborough私邸病殁。噩訊傅出。全國文學界莫不悼惜。聞柯氏得病原因係因。去年在丹麥那威瑞典各國演講精神學說。日久積勞成疾。於去年十一月初起。病勢逐漸加劇。不料竟從此不起也。柯氏死後。遺有一妻二子云。</p>
<p>不忍釋手儼如對愛人然。惟晚香玉·紫丁香·鳶尾諸花。香傷口音。甚且致啞。寄語多情人。愛花應有限度。不觀新娘手執之橙花球。雜以梔。子其目的無非利用臭之混合作用。减殺香勢耳。世人最喜之香料。莫麝若。蓋其近體臭性臭故。麝本身取自雄麝性部。波斯人以之塗鬚點額。博人讚美。穆罕默德有三愛。愛婦人。愛體香麝香。愛食物。吾國以麝薰被。認爲無上奢艷。人類於嗅亦。具主觀之好惡。對愛人不香亦香臭亦香。對仇人不臭亦臭。香亦臭。乳臭本無香。愛人則覺其。香脚垢原甚臭。而情人不之覺。此豈（同心之言。其臭如蘭）。歟</p>

<p>敎導一師此次在前方作戰。極爲努。力當前月圍攻歸德萬選才部時。以竹梯上城。萬部在城上。紛投炸彈死者極衆。而卒被攀登。後萬部俘虜對人言戰績對此草綠色軍服之健兒。猶有餘。怖某。次該師乃發現一逃兵。售其槍械。旋在徐州捕獲。將依軍律正法矣。忽爲蔣總司令所見。以爲敎導師何致有此怯戰者。遂召而問之。此人竟侃侃而陳曰。吾至前方作戰。而家有老母行將餓斃來書告急。吾實不忍坐視。故將槍械售去。得錢送至家中。已則仍回前方效力。孰意在徐竟被捕哉。蔣聞之惻然立赦其罪。仍令回營工作。</p>
<p>敎導師某團兵士二人。一日。同至團長處借餉。團長以無欵辭。乞之至再。猶不獲諾二人奮然曰。吾輩此次討逆。原存必死之心。現家人盼餉。急如星火。查軍營向例。每一死兵可得掩埋費二十元。團長盍提前以此欵發給吾等。將來如戰死沙塲。吾輩願暴屍弗殮也。團長不得已意許之焉。</p>
<p>中央軍待遇俘虜。頗厚。繳槍者俱可免死。西北軍方面則較苛。蓋北人直率。遇敵輒殺。無所謂人道不人道也。然亦有例外者某次。敎導師在蘭封作戰。一馬夫誤策馬入敵境。被俘獲。解至彼隊師長處。師長給以洋三十元。並大黑糢糢兩個。釋之歸。且戒之曰糢糢勿食盡。可留少許饋汝同營者。俾知此間食物佳也。馬夫大悅。疾馳歸。果留糢糢少許而中央軍多係南人。不慣麵食。食之皆嘔。</p>

<p>（五）人力車夫語</p>
<p>近來日本百事猛進。物質文明足與歐美並駕齊驅。但其平民之生活程度亦繼長增高。記者沿途與車夫談話。詢其生活狀况甚詳。答辭頗饒趣味。足以窺見日本下級社會之眞相。因約述之。車夫之言曰余卒業於高等小學校後。以謀生困難遂加入勞働團。以奔走勞力博徵資。一家數口。差足自給。收入平匀每日約二三圓。統計月在六七十圓以上。（日金）除交納車租。外家用尙有餘裕。另劃一部充子女敎育費蓋余深鑒於不學無術謀生之痛苦。誓爲兒輩謀充分敎養。俾將來在社會上獲得較優之位置春間各國團體東來觀光者月必數起。道經長崎。游覽全巿。而吾儕之收入亦激增。月平均在一百圓以上。則可兼爲冬令衣服之預備矣。吾儕職業雖苦。以國内政治修明。地方官吏盡職。對於貧民之生活。與以種種之便利。能以最經濟的辦法。解决食宿問題。並能獲到相當的舒適。故奔波終日所得以奉妻拏夜間家人團聚共話。絕勿慮有意外。其樂固融也。（國人聽諸）客等來自遠方。暢游日本全境。殊令人羡慕。余居本國境内。徒耳東京之繁盛。數十年來未嘗涉足其間。實爲生平第一恨事。以今日本國交通之便利京崎之往返。舉足之勞耳。第以經濟所困心。有餘力不足。國内與余抱同病者不知凡幾余今日之唯一希望。即在將來兒輩之能力圖上進。每月收入較優。或能償余一游東京之宿願也。余長子年已十八。肄業邑之中學校。苟有奮勉。不難考入大學則余之晚景。當可優游歲月。免作牛馬之生活矣。車夫言時。眉飛色舞無。　希望。溢於言辭。其識見之遠大殊有足多。其受經濟壓迫之苦况。吾人亦應表示萬分之同情。人力車夫之生活。月乃需日金六七十圓。約合國幣百二十元左右。其生活之高槪可想見且長崎非都巿可比。聞東京人力車夫月入約百五十圓日金。亦僅足敷開支。較之我國。蓋不可同日而語也。</p>
<p>萬惡之上海有大江西道。波濤浩蕩帆檣往來之黄浦。上有形之大江也。傾家蕩産。身敗名裂之禍源。如花會。輪盤賭。金業交易所等此三道無形的大江也。人皆知自殺於有形之大江者甚多。而不知犠牲於無形的大江中者尤衆。握管至此。吾不禁欷歔欲涕焉。昨晤友人陳君於交易所中。道及上月中。有一錢莊職員。因投機失敗。而瘋狂將。死其前因後果。適足爲一般利慾薰心自趨歧途者作前車之鑒。亟記如下。</p>

<p>我們究意能够應用多少字</p>
<p>談話讀書寫作、這是人們每天不能離開的事情、尤其是前者、就是野蠻、人小孩子都需要的、做這些事情的工具不消說是（字）這個東西、但是我們得想一想我們究竟能夠應用多少字呢、</p>
<p>關於這一點西洋人有許多有趣的統計在一八六○年牛津大學敎授ＭaxMuller在他的一個演說裏說一個英國的鄕下農夫、熟練地運用的字至多不過三百個、但是據KailLokotsch博士說、他這句話、在今日看來是不難駁倒的、他搜集了許多新奇的事守來駁Ｍluller敎授這句話、下面都是他的話、</p>
<p>美國ＷinneldSHall夫人記下她的幼兒從開始說話時起所說出的字、到第十七個月的時候、那孩子用了二百三十二個不同的字、到六歲時增至二千六百八十八個字、</p>
<p>這個當然只能算一個最低限度的數目、因爲小孩子總有許多字逃出了他母親和乳娘的記錄的、</p>
<p>德國語言學家Ｗundt也做過同樣的實騐他實騐出一個兩歲大的女孩運用了四百八十九個字、一個同歲的女孩用了一千一百二十八個字之多、</p>
<p>所以、ＭMuller敎授之說是無稽的、没有一個成年人用字比兩歲的小孩還少的、而且、有許多農業上的特用字農夫是不能不知道的、一個最頭腦簡單的農夫也斷不能靠三百字過活、</p>
<p>一個普通的人他在學校裏受了八年的普通敎育而且平日讀雜志閱報、聽無線電演講等等、他的字彙至少在一萬以上、</p>
<p>但是受了高等敎育的人更不同了、</p>
<p>Ｅ·Ｓ·Ｈlolden敎授曾經在韋氏大學字典中選出他所認識的字、計算起來一共是三萬三千四百五十六個字Ｅ·H·Babbitt先生實騐過他的學生、學生的大多數知道的字不下六萬其數目更爲可驚、</p>
<p>但是我們要知道認字和用字是迴不相同的、認識的字縱令是非常之多、用起來尤其是寫作不過是其中的少數這可大同大學文預科最優等、第一名畢業生柳無非女士爲柳亞子先生之女公子（葉長烈攝）</p>
<p>以從下面的例子上證明、</p>
<p>（依里亞特）和（奥特賽）兩首詩、共總只用得九千個不同的字字彙最富的作家莎士比亞、在他的全著作中、用字僅及兩萬左右、</p>
<p>歐美的文化人的用字是這樣的情形、再看看許多半未開化的人們情形是怎樣的了、</p>
<p>有許多原始民族的字彙是有可驚的數目的、一五五○年的墨西哥Ａztec文字的字典、已經有一萬三千字、一位調查者調查、連外套和外袴也不知道的Ｙaarans種族使用着三萬個字、最堪驚異的是亞拉伯人的字彙他們叫駱駝有百個不同的字、叫鏦子有五百個不同的字、叫一把劍有一千個不同的字、大家可以想像亞拉伯字典是如何的廣大的呵、</p>
<h3 id="c212">婚後的悲哀　靜 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>因事實的證明、使他不得不相信結婚是戀愛的墓墳、現在她所能得到的、惟有無聊和悲哀、她悔恨了、她悔恨自己不該急急地就和他結婚把甜蜜和美的情愛趕跑了、而且、把它永遠地深葬在墳墓中、怎不使她感受着異樣底悲哀喲、</p>
<p>她追溯着過去的愉快、生活的甜蜜、不覺微微的露出笑容、但現實跟着煩擾她、刹那間底笑容、又會立刻地收歛了去、恢復到她祇感到空虚寂寞的狀態、她又在眉宇間現出煩悶緊緊地縐着更痛恨支配着現實的這個魔、鬼、不自覺地舒了一口氣、、喊呼起來媽喲婚後的生活就是這樣的嗎、竟會變得這樣地使人難以嗜受的嗎、</p>
<p>在結婚的以前、她是如何底幸福啊、非單是路人嫉視視着、而所有認識她俩的親戚朋友、都在贊美她俩、眼熱地羡慕着、甚而她自己也很満足自驕地、自傲地、以爲愛之神格外地優待着她、</p>
<p>結婚後的不久、自然、還是像未婚前的一樣底熱烈、而且更培增地歡愉和婚前的比較、實有過之而無不及吧、但可惡的是、那主宰愛情的天使、它並没有與主宰其他的命運之神有所不同、它也是要作弄着人們、的尤其是不肯逃出盛極必衰的公例、在結婚後已有兩年了的她此刻、她能亨受到的祇有愛女的憨笑了吧、那愛侶的深情已不知那裏去了不知那裏去了有人說、愛女的憨笑就是犠牲愛侶深情的代價眞的嗎眞的是送去作了愛女的憨笑的代價了嗎她想到這裏、她眼前現出一陣暈黑、好似已經失去了一件珍寶永遠再難望返的珍寶使她不得不心酸不得不愉愉的拭着眼淚</p>
<p>傷心過後、看着愛女在搖籃中睡着很安靜底睡着、她就拿起紙筆、寫了一封信、寄給她的多年的好友說這是一封信吧、自然到不如說這是婚後的哀怨、來得刻切些、底下就是她寫的那封信、</p>
<p>雲瑤好友承你遠遠地寫了兩封信來問我的病我是如何地感激啊、那時我在病中、、而且琴兒終日糾纒着、我實在没有空所以没有寫回信、請你原諒、我相信你定能諒我的、</p>
<p>好朋友、我現在的心中是如何底煩惱、我此次的病、固然是因産後體虧的原故然亦可說是、由於煩惱而起的因爲在我俩夫婦間、産生了一種秘密的痛苦、</p>
<p>我的煩惱是什麽、老實說就是我的丈夫近來對我的愛情、漸漸地淡薄了、回想到初結婚時愛情、和現在比較起來、眞似淵之隔呵、</p>
<p>他眞不能原諒我、他說我近今給他的情愛、不如從前那麽地熱烈和深刻、不肯盡情地施愛、可眞寃枉了我啊、我恨不能拿出我的心來給了他去看個仔細、祇讓愛之神來知道我的心吧、甚至他又說我祇知道盡量地發揮母愛、把他丢在旁邊了、可是、瑤姊、要曉得女人到了有子女的時候、她要發揮母愛、這是她的天性底表現啊、怎能怨恨着我、固然我亦曉得、在這種情形下的男子、無論他是了解與否、他自然總得感覺着異樣和寂寞的、但我亦没得法啊</p>
<p>其實、他自己何常不是在轉變着他何常是在竭力地施愛總之我現在感覺着的也祇是平庸和寂寞好在有時逗着這個小東西的憨笑會把我的一切的一切都忘記了、假使没有琴兒時時地引趣着我的話、不曉得我也會覺感怎樣底難以忍受哩瑤姊親愛的瑤姊、你以爲我是很快樂的嗎、以爲我是亨盡了人生的美樂嗎、請你自己看吧我所享受到的婚後生活、到底是人生的美樂、還是人間底地獄、、實在已夠我的享受了、</p>
<p>讓我告訴你吧、結婚是戀愛的硬化時間但如能預防着、却依舊可保持從前的細膩底深情、瑤姊我雖則是知道不是我不能實行、我更不知道如何底纔能把它實行、所以我俩的遭遇也祇在沉悶寂寞底悲哀中、祇感着異樣的無聊和平庸·········</p>
<p>哎喲、我的小寶寶蠕動着、了大槪是快要醒了、我不能再和你多、寫萬千的哀怨無量數的苦衷祇好留待有機會時再和你談個暢快吧、（下略）</p>

<h3 id="c213">中國民族的病源及治療法志靜高槐川著 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>中國民族性的萎靡、中國民族的病入膏盲、受了二千年的毒根弄到這般病榻纒綿微存一息的此刻、一般人還要說偌大的中華民族是不怕其他民族來征服的、邓使被征服了的話、也是會同化它們的、更進一步、甚至患了満身的瘡瘰、還說自己是没有病、這確是可笑亦復可憐　　因存了這種觀念、根本不承認中華民族是有病、自然也更不去追究病的根源了那末、排佈我們面前的我們看中國人是否存有民族觀念認淸了自己的民族意識這是無可諱言的散沙一般的民衆、祇時時刻刻記得自己的家族什麽民族不民族、在他們的腦子裏好似没有這回事樣的、（中國民族的病源及治療法）底作者、見到了這點、他就痛痛快快地拿歷史的事實來證明中國民族的病至不可救藥的情形找出病的所在、找出病的根源、因時計宜、更下了一服十足的興奮劑開好一個方子像這樣的創作固然不能說是空前、也不能稱之謂一字一珠但在久中毒根、病入膏盲的現代中華民族我覺得是需要暴露自己的缺點、找出萎靡不振的癥結、</p>
<p>本書共分十六章、照例第一章是緒論、叙述一般人對於病的原因的見解有的說這是宗法的關係、有的說地理的關係、有的說是政體的關係、有的說學術的關係等等、作者認他們的是不能說他是完全不對、要之通同於中國的衰弱有莫大的關係、不過、（若不附帶條件就指定這幾是致弱的原因、事實上有所不理論上當然更不能通所以我認定中國的衰弱必另有一種東西從中作祟）這種作祟的東西再看他說（中國的衰弱就歷史的情事確乎看出來是一部份責任生了缺陷的關係、責任缺陷的原因是一部分受了病、他的作用脫開責任、反倒受病的驅使、去助長病勢、多年積累遂造成一個東亞病夫、）</p>
<p>所以在他的著作的第二部分中、他就盡量地揭穿這一部分責任生了缺陷的眞相、他痛駡中國的讀書人、從漢代以後就夢寐不忘的是官、想做官自然算不得壤事、可是這批想做官的讀書人的用意却有些特殊了、（仔細考察起來他們所想的是官的威權、官的體統官的繁榮、作了官可以遂心可以適意可以縱欲可以濟私、爲自己的方便想官爲自己的幸福想官、並不是爲研究政治運用政治的責任、才去想官官、裏邊更有一種正中下壤的事、就是發財、發了、財旣可以豐衣足食、又可以驕妻美妾更可以子子孫孫的富貴不斷頭、利之所在、人共趨之所以這發財兩個字又把他們那想官的熱度、增加了幾百倍、他們的心理作用到了這種程度、自然就又說不上官的責任了、政治是如何研究他也不問、政治是如何運用他也不管、就單單的認定這讀書是求官的工具、作官是讀書的報酬爲求官而讀書、因讀書而得官讀書是作官的因作官是讀書的果、讀書等到作了官、就算是善困善果、可以對天可以告人、再没有絲毫的遺憾、纎細的缺點了、</p>
<p>接着作者又論中國官吏的責任的缺陷、根據歷史的事實他下的結論是（周公以前的官吏、是負責任的列國時代的官吏、是無能負責不得已而全個人身分的、西漢的官吏是專顧消極的責任、脫掉了積極責任的、漢末以後的官吏不但是把積極的責任丢掉、就是那消極的責任、也丢了個乾凈凈、不但是消極的責任、就是他個人的身分、也犠牲下去、甘心作一個皇帝的利用品、一個人若是到了不顧身分的程度自然就要一天一天的走下坡路没有什麽高明事實可言了所以那晉以後的官吏、就單純去想做官的虚榮錢的實惠、不要說是官吏的身分弄得不堪言狀就是那官吏本身的能力知識也一天减少過一天直到了宋明末葉、那個官吏的衙署就幾幾乎成了一個廢民院、大家不信、請看看那金元淸内侵的時候、他們是怎麽樣的對待、就可以明白了、自然他們關於求官的訣　不能不探討關於作官的方法、不能不研究關於找錢的門路、更不能不尋覓了所以弄到所有的大官（平時不能經國亂時不能應變、我們看看那和戰不定議論紛然的宋、同那事急則閧然事緩則閧然的明、就可以知道他們的伎俩、地方的官吏能不及巿儈智不及書吏、我們看看那堂上不分原被告野外不辨麥和黍亦可以證明他們的知識）對人民的福利問題、他們毫不頋及簡直成了一個是出錢的義務者、一個是要錢的權利者更何論他們顧及民族性的培養、</p>
<p>其次作者講到中國軍人責任的缺陷上在（好鐵不打釘、好人不當兵）底中國社會心理中應募的人自然没有好的份子了、都是那些窮而且懶的無頼份子爲着生活所迫、不得不挺而走險於是不謀而合地盡數集在一個招兵的旗幟下（於是弄得兵的组織、就完完全全的成了一種窮民懶民暴民的集合體、一旦要出發作戰的時候、也就莫明其妙究爲何事祇聽到上司下個命令、呌着開步走那就祇好背起槍桿子、拖着腿衝向前綫去到吃着子彈死了的時候、也不曉得爲的什麽而犠牲了、可是從來没有看到過爲民族的戰爭能像私鬥那麽的勇敢他們根本就不知道當兵的意義、當兵的責任</p>
<p>中國的病實在是太多、病的程度也夠深了槪括底講一句、可說都是富貴病的作祟、本書第三部份就把中國病的各方面佈露得很澈底老老實實地說出病的癓結所在、統觀歷代經過的事實不是爲保富貴而設制即是求富貴而紛爭兩千年來政局變化忽張忽弛、時動時靜無一不以富貴爲中心（所以不論什麽塲合當中、總是私利的竸爭不見甚麽公益的成就、議論多、事實少、竟見多努力少以私爲私以公爲私、化公爲私假公濟私私的辦法、處處皆是人人皆能）就完完全全地成了一種社會病、</p>
<p>這在誰都知道、自然不能任這種可怕的社會病蔓延下去作者對於這點他定出療治法及其次序、他覺得兵的缺陷、好似霍亂病必先設法防止這個霍亂病、回頭來再說那個蔓延了兩千年的富貴病、總之他的治療法在農工商方面是用防堵的辦法、不使病魔侵入、在士的方面、是用圈制的辦法、剪除病魔的羽翼、在求官的方面、是用堵剿的方法截斷病魔的出路在作官的方面、是用剿撫兼施的辦法消滅病魔的勢力、絕斷病魔的生機、至於詳細的實施辦法、祇好請閱者參看原書了、</p>
<p>第四部份中、作者告訴我們關於中國前途的生機和新生命、從北伐完成了後訓政業已開始、對於政治上的改革至少總也有些在事實上也用不到貪多用不到務遠、量力責效不效則懲就是了中國人是懶的、假使以後的地方官肯敎大家作、防止大家不作中國的官是有（要錢不作事）底惡習假使有個監察院給那些作官的一點怕局、自然中國的新生機是有望的吧、推已及人、把自己的民族性振作起來後、我們自然更可以遵守孫中山先生的民族主義、求世界各民族的福利平均知難行易祇怕我們還没有澈底的瞭解、假使我們都認淸了自己底民族性、肯努力地幹的話我們的前途是光明的是偉大的至時白日當空萬物煦育、像那個寒夜月光爲我們作補助品、亦未可知、</p>
<p>逃不出普通一般的格式、也是照例末了的一部分是結論在結論、中又述近今外部壓迫的情形和内部弱點的所在且說（外部的壓迫、實由内部的弱點所引起、内部的弱點、實爲内部的病症所鑄成）、所以我們要中華民族的健全、我們就應努力地去除惰性和忿世嫉俗的病態、我們更應糾正錯誤的意識充實固有優美的民族性、</p>
<p>不是我有意地吹毛求疵、我實在覺得有些美中不足關於中國病的方面著者所報告的都是些識字的階級、至於佔大華民族大多數底平民的意志、並没有露怖出一些缺陷似乎是不無缺點我并不是要把官和讀書人的罪惡移送到大多數的平民身上去官和讀書人的罪惡是事實同時平民的無知以致整個民族的不振、似乎亦是個缺陷吧、這也是事實、我覺得大多數的平民確也可憐了他們不曉得有那麽（國）的一回事、也就不曉得自己是個中國人、自然也認不清自己的民族意識了、弄得受雙重的壓迫和剥削之下、他還是情願吃點虧、求有事化無事這種社會病態的大現象、豈容我們忽視而不求補救的喲、</p>
<p>世界上因懶致亡的國家并不是没有、我們再懶下去、恐怕就要覆轍相尋了、危急存亡之秋的中華民族、還可再不負起爲民族的責任嗎、應如何底消除民族病菌、喚起民族意識鞏固中華民族的力量呵、</p>
<h3 id="c214">姊妹們的消息湯增敭 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>徐鶴林著</p>
<p>現代的靑年人都染着了一種所謂世紀病終日嘗受着不幸的剌激於是便衰頽下去了、結果是在能調和枯燥生活</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>的文藝範圍裏尋找一點意想不到的安慰這是所謂企求人生的安慰唯一底方法、而且、從自己熱烈的心坎中喚發出來的呼聲、格外覺得眞實有趣可以作爲生活過程中所遺留下去的紀念、僅這一點、一個靑年文藝者發洩他自己的創作慾也不無没有意義的吧、徐鶴林君他所以要寫下這（姊妹們的消息）留存於世人的眼前也是爲了這個原因、</p>
<p>但是徐君從自己内心吐露出來的哀鳴記號却很能引起我們讀者的同情有如我們所要表露的不幸的遭遇、作者却已很忠實地替我們用文字寫了下來、赤裸裸地盡露無餘、在受了同樣金箭頻擊的心靈也獲得一絲絲（平凡人類平凡宇宙所不能給我的慰安和快活）這因爲作者叙述眞實不虚的原故、</p>
<p>一本小集子、裏面所包羅的内容能引起讀的共嗚、同時並能給予一種不能獲得的安慰、實在難能可貴但是本書作者竟能這樣的做到了、所以我相信和作者（共感）的人一定不少那麽這（姊妹們的消息）便有打聽的必要了、</p>
<p>全書僅一百零六頁、收羅七個短篇創作、一（姊妹們的消息、）二（可憐的晚會）三（西湖上的喜劇）四（新覺悟）五（小汚點、）六（驢的啤吟）七（佳遇）這裏面旣有女人的音訊又有女人的故事所以命名（姊妹們的消息、）是非常的撮合、（可憐的晚會）等篇描寫（婦人的勝利）很有見地、將愛的眞義用藝術的手腕表露出來使我們讀了也知同嘴嚼着（愛情的滋味、</p>
<p>作者描寫女性的心理却格外顯能有時緊張、有時鬆懈有時細膩、有時粗暴不啻將女人的心、整個地從胸中挖了出來擺在歡衆的眼前比看什麽還透澈些、</p>
<p>聰敏的英英立即懂得這便是他對於自己的未來奢願和秘密思想心聲了、雖很願意允諾這個眞正感動的請願可是此刻爲保持人與人剛觀面時精神的尊嚴起見、便有故意說兩句遁詞來躱避這感動直接射擊的必要、便佯作未聽淸楚的神態、匆遽回答道（我們從前已同遊過三四次了、是的</p>
<p>不過從前是許多人同來遊的、）（四四頁）</p>
<p>我們看了（西湖上的喜劇）裏這樣短短的一段、便能明白作者對於女人的心理與態度所刻畫的漓淋盡緻、有如看見了整個的女人的心、這樣强有力的描寫的手宛委實値得企羡、在許多創作的書中而不能多得的同時、作者或許對於婦女問題也有相當的研求否則他描寫女性的一枝筆無論如何是不會有這樣的靈活生動、</p>
<p>（不、不、我對良心發誓、我愛你又愛孩子、但我不能不愛自己了這就是我昨晚以來的新覺悟、（</p>
<p>（當然是覺悟對於我、當然算得是很新的覺悟、設若我永没有這覺悟我的生命終將破碎在良母賢妻的擔</p>
<p>子下面而無人顧惜……）（六二頁）在上面兩節很簡單的對話中、很顯明的可以見到兩性間的家庭問題、以及從舊社會裏遺留下來的所謂（良母賢妻）的觀念、這也是作者對婦女問題有相當研求的確證在（新覺悟）這一篇中、他還將男性對於女性的蔑視欺凌、以及兇險爲心贜都赤裸裸地暴露了、</p>
<p>（…我的一切靑年光陰一切靑年精力一切靑年容貌、一切靑年希望一切靑年詩興都被你斷送了埋葬了犠牲了、而你却時常拿起利的眼光來看我、看孩子看家庭看人生社會、更時常拿起驕傲的態度來對我、對孩子對家庭對人生社會唉呀、你思想一點一點腐臭起來　　、你竟一點不知道你的從積世祖宗就遺傅下來而潛藏在你玉體的繼維裏面的壓制女性的劣根性、一點一點發作起來、你一點不覺得、你你何等可憐何等可哂何等可哭、（六三頁）</p>
<p>這是多麽有意義的話、居然發出於一個婦人之口實在是不容易更可以看出這女性整個的堅决的個性、漸攫着新的意識、走上覺悟的路上去、而且、作者徐君對於民族的意識也稍地攫住一些、不過他是由家庭爲出發點並且這成分是很少、</p>
<p>這實實在在因爲我們的今天以前的家庭、是不合學理的、没有組織的有病的、是爲失敗倘若我們定要使這樣你我都切實感到不満意的家庭維持下去、敷衍下去不很危險嗎不更痛苦嗎我們不是法蘭式的（遠於眼者遠於心）的民族、其實、我們的情愛的甜蜜還將爲（遠於眼）的緣故而愈覺濃眞……</p>
<p>作者具這種意識也是必然的事、因為他表現中華女性的個性很有力、也可算是發揚民族上的精神、尤其是對於中國新舊家庭中種種現象的描寫、不過這還不是進取的積極的祗可以代表他把握着一些浅薄的民族意識而已、</p>
<p>（姊妹們的消息）一、篇雖然是十封通訊將它織成功的一篇故事、但連貫的看了下去、也有相當的意義、不像一般通俗情簡的那樣無聊、實在因為描寫女性心理的强力和家庭間所發生的種種故事的創作過於寥寥的原故、、本書之値得介紹也僅有這一點、</p>

<h3 id="e7">Italy's Attitude Towards the French Foreign Minister's Statement on Shipbuilding <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>One of the concerns for the future of peace in the world today is the relationship between France and Italy. Although French Foreign Minister Briand also acknowledged the tension between France and Italy, he has been trying his best to salvage the situation in the hope of eliminating this dangerous state of affairs. He recently announced that he is willing to temporarily suspend naval shipbuilding work within this year so that the negotiations between France and Italy can be reopened and return to friendship. This is indeed Foreign Minister Briand's painstaking effort. It is also believed that at a time when the world is facing the same financial difficulties, all countries should slightly lower their ambitions and restrain their courage, and temporarily endure slights in order to avoid the crisis of war. Even if there is a belligerent country, no matter how wronged it is, it should bow its head and temporarily endure it for a while. However, judging from Italy's claims today, it is not yet certain that it will be like this. According to a Rome report, political circles here are quite lukewarm towards Briand's statement on the temporary suspension of shipbuilding. They say that this proposal may be acceptable only for the sake of promoting negotiations, but the Italian newspapers still unanimously denounce the French theory of security, saying that it wants to fulfill its ambition of dominating Europe, and they also chant the theory of revising the treaty and lifting the shackles of the defeated countries, apparently intending to please Germany and Austria and make things difficult for France. The Italian newspapers have always been Mussolini's mouthpiece. If the Italian newspapers are like this, then the intentions of the Italian government can be known. In short, Mussolini's intention has always been that he does not believe that the Fascist army is insufficient to conquer Europe, he does not believe that the Fascist economy is insufficient to override other countries, and he does not believe that the Fascist doctrine is insufficient to defeat all doctrines in the world. Therefore, regardless of the world's current trend and environment, he must achieve his goal. Since Mussolini has this kind of thinking, it is no wonder that he ignores Briand's statement on the temporary suspension of shipbuilding, and the thorny path ahead between France and Italy is also unpredictable.</p>

<p>Three Hundred Injured</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 11th - Although the police had forbidden the public from gathering in Medan Square, the Nationalist Party still planned to hold a demonstration there today, which led to a disturbance. The police used batons to disperse the crowd, resulting in forty people being injured. According to statistics, no less than sixty non-violent resistance volunteers were injured in various places. The chairman of the Bombay Nationalist Party, Modi, led a marching team himself and was also injured in the chaos. It is expected that the Nationalist Party will still gather in Medan Square this afternoon, so the infantry and mounted police are now guarding the main roads to prevent them from passing. At the same time, troop-carrying vehicles are also prepared to depart in case of emergency.</p>

<p>France Willing to Suspend Shipbuilding to Promote Negotiations</p>
<p>Italy Agrees to Abandon Request for Trusteeship of Fez</p>
<p>French Ambition to Dominate</p>
<p>Italian Newspapers Continue to Attack</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 11th - French newspapers have been commenting on France's willingness to suspend shipbuilding before the end of this year to facilitate Franco-Italian naval negotiations. Even the popular newspapers claim that the issue of ceding the territory near Tripoli, Libya, in North Africa can be resolved through mediation. France is now willing to cede 120,000 kilometers to Italy, and the Italians are also willing to follow Briand's advice and abandon their request for a trusteeship colony, because the sovereignty of the trusteeship colony belongs to the League of Nations, which goes beyond the scope of Franco-Italian negotiations.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 10th - After French Foreign Minister Briand announced France's proposal to temporarily suspend naval construction competition, Italian newspapers did not agree with a single word. However, political circles here have indicated that if this proposal is only for the purpose of promoting Franco-Italian negotiations, the Italian government may accept it. At this time, the Italian newspapers still unanimously denounced the French theory of security, saying that it is purely an ambition to dominate Europe. In addition, they also advocate revising the treaty and lifting the shackles of the defeated countries. According to reports, although the Italian government does not state its position at this time, the Italian newspapers' tone is usually controlled by the government. Mussolini clearly wants to use public opinion to put pressure on France so that it can accept his demands.</p>

<p>Reed Criticizes the General Staff for Inconsistency</p>
<p>Hoover Refuses to Hand Over Documents for His Own Reasons</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 11th - Senator Hale, who had previously launched a major attack on the London Naval Treaty in the Senate, responded to Hale's arguments in the Senate this morning, denying that the United States had to sacrifice any rights under the Naval Treaty. On the contrary, he said that if the Senate rejected the Naval Treaty, Japan would be the first to panic. Although that country has recently experienced economic and unemployment difficulties, for the sake of self-defense, it will not hesitate to actively strengthen its national defense. Reed also directly criticized the General Staff for being self-contradictory. Before the Naval Treaty was established, the group advocated the convenience of six-inch gun cruisers, but today they suddenly reversed their previous proposals and attacked the Naval Treaty. It is important to know that the hope of dominating the sea is actually greatly contrary to the facts and is by no means a good way to solve the naval problem. I am afraid that the war will begin before the matter is started, etc.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 11th - Yesterday, during the Senate debate on the naval amendment treaty, those who opposed ratification tried their best to demand that the authorities make public their so-called secret documents. President Hoover has now replied to the Senate, refusing to make them public. As far as is known, the so-called secret documents are only coded telegrams from the U.S. Ambassador Dawes to President Hoover. The reason why the authorities refuse to publish them is because the telegrams are of a personal nature and mention the characteristics of the diplomats present at the meeting. President Hoover said that his duty is to maintain good relations with other countries, so he cannot disclose secrets and commit the crime of breaking trust. If the senators want to read these documents and keep them confidential, then these documents can be made public. Senator Norris proposed a motion because the president refused to make them public, intending to reject the treaty or postpone its consideration to the autumn. The main purpose of his proposal is to request the government to declare that there are no secret agreements that could affect the provisions of the treaty in any way.</p>

<p>Disregarding the Opinions of the Military, Deciding to Adopt Consultation Procedures</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 12th - Regarding the government's attitude toward the consultation request for the Naval Treaty, regardless of the opposition of some of the navy, the intention to request consultation before the summer vacation has been generally agreed upon. Foreign Minister Shidehara visited Prime Minister Hamaguchi last night and said that the approval procedures of the United Kingdom and the United States are proceeding smoothly, but Japan's delay seems inappropriate. They then exchanged views on promoting approval. As a result, the Foreign Minister went to Okitsu to visit Prince Saionji in the afternoon to explain the procedure for approving the treaty and request understanding. Minister of the Navy Takarabe also consulted with the Prime Minister and Finance Minister, and then invited Chief of Naval General Staff Taniguchi to the official residence in the afternoon to inform him of the government's intentions, believing that no matter how hard they try, if it is difficult to obtain unanimous approval within the Navy Department, they have no choice but to listen to it and request understanding. In addition, Cabinet members Watanabe and Matsuda originally planned to travel to Sakhalin in mid-June to inspect affairs. Prime Minister Hamaguchi has instructed Chief Secretary Suzuki to convey the message and ask them to postpone the trip until after the consultation procedures are completed. Governor-General of Korea Saito also departed from Seoul for Tokyo on the 16th and is scheduled to stay for three weeks. The government plans to ask Governor-General Saito to mediate the highest levels of the navy and other aspects to proceed with the consultation procedures.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Helsinki, 11th - After the Finnish Lapua anti-communist farmers left Beijing, there was only a brief period of tranquility. Now, rumors are rife again. The authorities have increased the number of police to protect the Soviet embassy to prevent attacks by anti-communist elements. In addition, the new prime minister and cabinet members have also repeatedly received assassination and threatening letters, which are expected to be done by communists. As for the cases of conflicts between anti-communist factions and communists in various parts of the country, they are often discovered, and arson incidents are also increasing day by day, which shows that this matter is brewing. Therefore, it is expected that the Lappo farmers' petition to Beijing this time is only the prelude to the incident.</p>

<p>New Tariffs Cause Countries to Resist</p>
<p>Automobile Manufacturers Affected by Internal and External Factors</p>
<p>Washington News - Since the passage of the new U.S. tariff bill, many countries have revised their tariff rules to resist it. For example, Italy has increased the import tax on automobiles by 110% to 120%, the United Kingdom and Argentina have banned the import of American apples, Canada plans to implement retaliatory tax laws on some American goods, and France plans to cancel the most-favored-nation treatment for American goods. News of such retaliatory plans has been heard almost every day, and Washington is quite moved. Although the authorities mostly maintain a calm attitude, claiming that these situations will eventually adjust themselves, a kind of panic is secretly rising, especially regarding Italy's resistance. The annual export value of American automobiles reaches 500 million gold yuan, which is one of the largest exports. Now, in order to avoid the high tax rates in the country, General Motors Corporation and Ford Motor Company feel that they have no choice but to establish manufacturing plants overseas. Italy's move makes it even more necessary for American automobile manufacturers to establish factories overseas. If so, the number of unemployed American workers will increase even more (World).</p>

<p>Discussing this issue of the Monroe Doctrine in East Asia will naturally arouse suspicion and misunderstanding among the masses. I know it very well. However, the sincerity and friendship of the political circles and the masses in New York have dispelled my fears. The people of New York listened to my words in a very friendly state, the masses loved my frankness, and the newspapers also had many sympathetic comments. The attitude of the people of New York obviously greatly helped my negotiations in Washington.</p>
<p>I stayed in New York for a week before returning to Washington. I went to the White House to pay my respects to the U.S. President. At that time, the President's attitude was even more friendly than before, praising my speeches in New York, saying that it was enough to dispel many misunderstandings between Japan and the United States. Secretary of State Lansing's attitude also changed greatly. Lansing said that the frank remarks I had repeatedly made had enabled him to formulate a plan to deal with the current situation. When we re-raised the issue of the first conversation, Lansing asked me what words I would use to express Japan's special position in China. I replied that the words "supreme interests" were most suitable. When Lansing heard this, he strongly opposed it, and declared that if the United States recognized Japan's use of this term, then the United States would not be able to interfere with any actions Japan took in China in the future.</p>
<p>I explained to him, "The meaning of 'supreme interests' is not as Lansing imagines. I also cited the example of Mr. Fornuse of the United States, who also used this phrase in the past to represent the interests of the United States in Mexico. I also explained that Japan's interests in China are similar to the interests of the United States in Mexico, so I chose this phrase because the United States used it against Mexico and did not hinder Mexico's open-door policy."</p>
<p>Lansing did not answer, but said that the U.S. President himself would also object. I then stated that Japan was not determined to use this term, and it could also choose a term that the U.S. government thought was suitable. I proposed using "special relationship and influence" to replace it. After repeated negotiations, it was finally decided to use "special relationship" and delete the word "and influence". Recalling the term "supreme interests", it was first used by the United States, and later used in the third paragraph of the second Anglo-Japanese Alliance draft to represent Japan's interests in China, stating "Japan enjoys political, military and economic (supreme interests) in Korea."</p>
<p>Lansing was very pro-China, mostly due to his personal relationship, because Lansing was the son-in-law of former Secretary of State Foster, and Foster had served as an advisor to the Chinese government. Therefore, it was only natural for Lansing to protect China. Although he was pro-China, he was not anti-Japanese. If the negotiations were between England and Japan, or between Japan and Russia, or between France and Japan, then he would probably side with Japan.</p>
<p>Because the issue of canceling the spheres of influence in China could not be resolved, our agreement could not proceed smoothly. Although I was very willing to make concessions on the issue of spheres of influence so that other important issues could be resolved smoothly, the Japanese government was under the influence of the elders in the Diplomatic Research Committee and delayed issuing a definite reply. In order to avoid discussing this issue in detail, I made it clear to Lansing that the Japanese government did not want to agree to the abolition of spheres of influence in China by only Japan and the United States, believing that this abolition should be announced jointly by the powers enjoying interests in China. However, the Japanese government's hesitation to immediately agree to cancel the spheres of influence aroused suspicion from the American officials, who opposed using the term "supreme interests" in the agreement. This is very regrettable.</p>
<p>The negotiations to cancel the Lansing-Ishii Agreement were greatly misunderstood by the public. The general public believed that the Lansing-Ishii Agreement was canceled at the Washington Naval Disarmament Conference, but it was actually canceled on April 14, 1923, about a year after the Washington Conference.</p>
<p>Japan's special relationship in China is actually due to geographical reasons and does not need the recognition of the United States, nor does it need the recognition of other powers. However, this kind of unnecessary recognition is sometimes beneficial. Therefore, recognition by the United States is also beneficial to Japan. However, the cancellation of the Lansing-Ishii Agreement has no impact on Japan's special interests in China, because this kind of special interest was not produced by the Lansing-Ishii Agreement, nor was the cancellation of the Lansing-Ishii Agreement the goal.</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the Xiang Incident occurred, the armies were ordered to aid Hunan, and He Yingqin also went to supervise the army. The war on the Pinghan Railway cannot help but be slightly calm. Recently, the Xiang Incident was resolved, and He returned to Hankou to take charge. Therefore, the situation in front is becoming tense again. He Chengjun has been planning the strategy for attacking the enemy at Luohe for several days and is planning it in detail. He has also convened several military meetings with the army commanders such as Xu Yuanquan, Yang Hucheng, Hao Mengling, and Xiao Zhichu. There are detailed regulations on the offensive plan to be implemented step by step and continue to progress. At the same time, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, considering that the Pinghan generals have worked hard and have made great contributions, has promoted them separately. Xu Yuanquan, the army commander of the Tenth Army and commander of the Forty-eighth Division, was promoted to the Commander-in-Chief of the Sixteenth Route. Xiao Zhichu, the commander of the Forty-fourth Division, was the deputy. Yang Hucheng, the army commander of the Seventh Army, was promoted to the Commander-in-Chief of the Seventeenth Route. Shangguan Yunxiang, the commander of the Forty-seventh Division, and Hao Mengling, the commander of the Fifty-fourth Division, were appointed as the army commander and deputy army commander of the Ninth Army, respectively, and took office in front. As for the Northwest Army, the troops of Zhang Weixi and others have repeatedly failed to attack, and the morale of the army has been slightly weakened. The troops of Liu Ruming, who detoured to northern Hubei, were also defeated by Fan Shisheng. They are now gathering in Xuchang and will jointly defend with one division of Liu Yufen's troops newly added by Feng Yuxiang. (July 11)</p>

<h3 id="e52">He Jian Reports on the Progress of the Campaign <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Hengzhou: Military strategies of the two armies in battle</p>
<p>Three reasons for Zhang Guijun's defeat</p>
<p>Changsha dispatch: Because the military affairs in southern Hunan have come to an end, He Jian returned to the province on the evening of the 6th and attended the enlarged party, government, and military memorial week on the 7th to report on the progress of the campaign. I will record his words as follows: (In the past month, Hunan has suffered from the ravages of the rebel Zhang Gui's army. The losses, both public and private, have been enormous, and the people have suffered unspeakably. I feel exceptionally uneasy about this. Fortunately, Director He personally came to Hunan to guide the Central Army from all directions and quickly defeated the rebel Zhang Gui's army. Apart from the weapons seized and the prisoners captured, there are few remaining, and they have completely fled Hunan. The campaign to suppress the rebellion in Hunan has thus come to a temporary end. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly report on the recent military situation in Hunan. After the Fourth Route Army recovered Changsha on the 17th of last month, the rebel army's initial plan was to flee to Guangdong, engaging the Eighth Route Army with its main force in Youxian and Anren. If they were to win by luck, they would head to Guangdong; if they were to fail, they would retreat to Jiangxi. Unexpectedly, the Eighth Route Army narrowed the battlefield, concentrated its forces, and did not engage the rebel army in the Youan area. As a result, the rebel army was able to rush to Yongxing. At that time, the Eighth Route Army wanted to change the battlefield, gather around the Guangdong border, and intercept them again. Coincidentally, the 49th Route Army was chasing towards Youan, and the reinforcements from Wuhan, including Xia Douyin, Li Yunheng, and Qian Dajun, and Tan Daoyuan from Jiangxi also arrived near Changsha one after another. Their forces were strong and had gained the greatest advantage. I immediately telegraphed Commander Jiang of the Eighth Route Army, saying that the rebel enemy could be eliminated in the Laiyang and Changning area, and that there was no need to concentrate on the Guangdong border. Furthermore, I personally rushed to Hengshan and discussed the matter in detail with Commander Jiang over the phone. Commander Jiang decisively agreed to stand by in Hengzhou and immediately transferred a division stationed in Laiyang back to Hengzhou. The rebel army, unaware of the situation, assumed that the Eighth Route Army could not retreat and returned to Hengzhou. Therefore, Zhang Fakui immediately rushed to the east bank of Hengzhou and attacked Hengzhou. At this time, the Eighth Route Army had three divisions in Hengzhou. When Zhang Gui's dense formation rushed over, they were swept by our machine guns, killing more than a thousand people, giving the rebel army a great blow. Zhang realized that his plan would not succeed and immediately ordered a retreat. According to reports, Zhang's retreat order contained the intention of luring the Eighth Route Army out of Hengzhou for a counterattack. At that time, I had arrived in Hengzhou, and the troops of the 53rd Division had also arrived in Hengzhou. We considered that if the rebel army were to counterattack again, it would be walking into a trap and accelerating its own destruction, which would be good news. Later, Zhang crossed the Lai River and retreated along the Xiang River towards Changning and Qiyang. Because the Eighth Route Army did not leave Hengzhou to pursue, they turned around and attacked Hengzhou again. Furthermore, Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi declared to their subordinates that Chen Jitang had already blocked the Guangdong border in Guangdong, and Guangxi had already been occupied by Li Mingrui, making it impossible to go there. The only way to survive was to counterattack Hengzhou. Hengzhou only has one division of Guangdong troops, and its strength is not great. We will live if we advance, and die if we retreat. They encouraged their troops to turn back from Qichang and attack Hengzhou again. At this time, the Eighth Route Army and the 53rd Division in Hengzhou had a total of four divisions. They met the enemy head-on and dealt a heavy blow. The Fourth Route Army also抄出 from the side, forming a three-pronged encirclement. Within a few days, four to five thousand enemy soldiers were killed. The main force of the rebel army was broken and could not hold on, so they ordered a retreat and gathered at Huangsha River. Soldiers deserted with their guns along the way. Initially, the various units of the Fourth Route Army followed along the way to Sifen, Youxian, Anren, and other areas. Because Li Pinxian obeyed the rebel orders of Li (Zongren) (Bai, Chongxi) and commanded the pseudo-Eighth Army and Li Zongren's guard regiment, Zhang Fakui's independent regiment, and Xu Zongwu's troops to cover the rear and prevent the Fourth Route Army from advancing rapidly, the Fourth Route Army continued to pursue and made rapid progress, seizing many rifles one after another. When they chased to Changlai, the Eighth Route Army had just defeated the rebel army that had invaded Hengzhou. Taking advantage of this, the Fourth Route Army抄入 Laiyang and Yongzhou. On July 3, the 19th Division occupied Yongzhou and seized many rifles. On the 4th, they had followed to Huangsha River and made contact with Zhang Fakui's troops again, capturing many prisoners. The rebel Zhang Gui's army suffered heavy casualties after several heavy blows from the Fourth and Eighth Route Armies and the 53rd Division. In addition, many were disarmed and deserted. At most, only 10,000 people have fled back to their old nest. When the rebel army first entered Hunan, according to Bai Chongxi's declaration, they had 28,000 rifles, plus the rifles of bandits and rebel troops recruited in Hunan, claiming to have 30,000. After these few campaigns of suppression, they have indeed lost more than two-thirds and have lost their system, unable to form an army. This time, the air force also achieved great results in suppressing the rebellion. We were very clear about the actions of the rebel army because we had aircraft reconnaissance. Furthermore, we dropped bombs one after another, killing many enemies. Liang Chongxi, the commander of the pseudo-Eighth Division (not Liang Chaoji), has been killed by bombing. The two rebels, Bai Chongxi and Yang Tenghui, were also wounded by bombing. Bai was injured in the shoulder. I personally asked the postman who was bombed at the same time as Bai. According to him, Bai was severely injured. The postman also lost an ear in the bombing. In addition, according to the confessions of the prisoners, the same is true. On July 4, when most of the rebel army collapsed and retreated, 14 sedan chairs were bombed to ashes by aircraft bombs. It is estimated that many rebel officers were killed. However, we have not yet received reports on who was killed. The Hengzhou Hospital received only a few hundred wounded soldiers from the Eighth Route Army and the 53rd Division. There are more than a thousand wounded soldiers from the rebel army. Also, the number of casualties in the previous battle in Liling was previously unknown. According to recent reports from the hospital, excluding those with minor injuries and those who were sent away, there are more than a thousand people who are seriously injured and are still in the hospital for treatment. From this, we can see the great losses of the rebel army. Why did the rebel army suffer such great losses this time? This is certainly due to the central government's prestige and Director He's effective guidance, as well as the efforts of all officers and soldiers in combat. However, the fundamental reasons for the rebel army's failure include the following three points: First, the rebel army lost the party's position. Before Bai Chongxi defected, he once told me that his opposition to Wang Jingwei was to save the party, and that his desire to eliminate Zhang Fakui was because Zhang had some communist characteristics. Therefore, he had this conscientious proposal. Now, Bai Chongxi has actually cooperated with Wang and Zhang, whom he had always opposed and advocated eliminating. It can be seen that he no longer saves the party, nor does he want conscience. Also, the two rebels, Ge and Feng, were considered by Li, Bai, and others to be the most incompatible warlords. Now, they are also openly cooperating with them to endanger the party and the country. Li, Bai, and other rebels' actions have separated them from the party's position. Any action that loses the party's position is bound to fail. This is the fundamental reason for the rebel army's great defeat. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Li Guojun Incites Old Troops to Riot</p>
<p>He Jian Sends Luo Fan Ying Again to Suppress</p>
<p>Xiangxi Counties Organize Security Associations</p>
<p>September Changsha Dispatch: Chen Hanzhang, who had been stationed in Hongjiang, Xiangxi for many years, came from a green forest background and worked diligently to build up a force of more than four regiments. He was appointed as the commander of the Independent Eighth Brigade and concurrently as the commander of the Second Hunan Garrison. In February of this year, his subordinate, Li Guojun, the commander of the Third Regiment, rebelled and killed him. Li's regiment then occupied Hongjiang and joined the troops of Xie Bin, the commander of the newly编 Tenth Division, and was編 into a brigade commander. He Jian immediately promoted Chen Wo, the deputy commander of the Independent Eighth Brigade, to brigade commander and sent Luo Fanying, the commander of the 16th Division, to lead Peng Weiren's旅 to Hongjiang to cooperate with Chen Wo's troops in严勦. At the same time, he telegraphed the central government to转令 Xie Bin to leave Hunan as soon as possible and go to western Hubei, and prohibited the recruitment of the rebel troops of Li Guojun. As a result, Li lost outside support and abandoned Hongjiang, retreating to Qianyang and Zhijiang, relying on danger and resisting. After two months of confrontation and twenty battles, large and small, he was unable to maintain his position and asked He to recruit him. He准将 Li's troops were recruited into the Independent Regiment of the Fourth Route Army, and Xiong Pinjun was appointed as the regiment commander. Li Guojun himself was protected for his life and property and exempted from arrest. The matter had just been resolved when Zhang Guijun entered Hunan. Luo Fanying, commander of the 16th Division, was ordered to lead his师 to援宝. The defense of Hongjiang was handed over to Chen Wo. At this time, although Li Guojun had handed over his military power and lived in seclusion in his home in Zhijiang, all the officers and soldiers of his部队 belonged to the green forest brotherhood. Li was also the leading figure in the green forest in western Hunan. Therefore, the troops of the regiment were still secretly under Li's command. Xiong Pinjun was the regiment commander, but in fact he was just Li's puppet. After Luo师 left Hongjiang, they conspired to蠢动, secretly ordering the large and small bandits in the Qianyang, Zhijiang, and Chenxi areas to gather secretly in the Hongjiang and Xupu areas, taking advantage of the opportunity to riot. Fortunately, He Jian克复 Changsha and telegraphed Chen Wo to lead his部队 into Baoqing to截击 Zhang Guijun. Chen Wo then sent Chen Fangjia, the commander of the Second Regiment, to留守 Hongjiang and Xupu, and he led two regiments of troops out of Wugang. Li Guojun thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of and actually 二次叛变, claiming to be a certain师,拥 Xiong Pinjun as the师长, Li himself as the旅长, recruiting bandits from all over the place, 編 into three regiments, taking advantage of the weakness and straight撲 Hongjiang and Xupu. Chen Fangjia could not敌 and abandoned Hongjiang on one day, retreating to Xupu. After Li's army占得 Hongjiang, he secretly ordered He Yiting, a giant bandit in Xupu (编 by Li as the团长), to剌杀 Chen Fangjia in Xupu. In the混鬥 in Xucheng for one day and night, He匪 had many people, and Li Guojun sent a team from Hongjiang to help. Chen's部队 had a散兵's heart because the团长 had died. Except for those who were缴械, the rest潰竄 towards Xinhua and Wugang. In this way, more than a dozen counties in the two districts of Yuan and Jing in Xiangxi were占领 by Li's troops. The bandits along the border between Hunan and Guizhou gathered and gathered, and their声势浩大. Chen旅长 Wo received the news in Wugang and immediately led his two regiments of troops to回师 to讨叛. In the Longtan巿 of Xupu, he met Li's troops. The two sides酣鬥 for two days, and there were many casualties. Chen's部队 eventually retreated to Xinhua and整理 because of the众寡不敌. He also飞电 He Jian告急, and sent Chief of Staff Xiang Chengzou,星夜 to the province to report on the 二次叛变 of Li's部队 and the situation of蹂躪 Xiangxi, and asked to send a large army to勦. He Jian decided to send Luo Fanying, commander of the 16th Division, again to lead his部队 to勦. In the Xiangxi area, there will be another military operation. As for Li Fangjia, the团长 who was剌 in Xupu this time, was the younger brother of Chen Hanzhang, who was剌毙 in Hongjiang in February of this year. The Chen brothers can be said to be unfortunate. The officials and gentry in the counties currently占领 by Li's部队 have set up the Xiangxi Upper游临时维持委员会, publicly推曾 Ren贺耀组部师长 Yang Yongqing as the委员长, with the county magistrates of Xiangxi counties, Li Xin Xu, Li Shu, Zhao Rongsheng, Tian Mingyu, Li Fengsan, Chen Zhenqiu, Yao Chenghui, Nie Kangji, etc., and the gentry Lu Xin, Yang Guanglu Wu Kecheng, Song Yuntao, Qiu Guangxing, Hu Zuolin, Li He, Cheng Kuiguang, Long Yunhong, etc. as members, with the purpose of团结 the strength of various counties and维持 the local area.

<p>Diplomatic circles息: The new French Minister Weirton expressed the following to others before leaving for Beiping: "I met my old friend Li Yuying in Shanghai. I have long admired his lofty political goals and he is also very knowledgeable about French culture. I also met Dr. Zheng Yuxiu, whom I had already met in Paris. I went to Nanjing this time and met with various important figures in the political circles, such as Wang 惠, the President of the Judicial Yuan, Hu Hanmin, the President of the Legislative Yuan, Wang Zhengting, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Kong Xiangxi, the Minister of Industry and Commerce, Sun Ke, the Minister of Railways, Wei Daoming, the Mayor of Nanjing, and other important figures. After meeting and talking with them, I had a feeling that the people in the Chinese political circles all have profound knowledge and are very different from the politicians of the past. In the past, I felt rigid and restrained during banquets and conversations, and there were many barriers between宝主. Now, I feel interesting when talking with knowledgeable and experienced people. I often admire the personality of the revolutionary martyrs of China. I knew Cai E. His ambition was lofty and made people respect him. When he was ill, he asked a French doctor to treat him. The doctor told him to rest quietly, otherwise his life would be in danger. Cai said that he had dedicated himself to the country and would not hesitate to sacrifice himself. Now I have met Wang Chonghui, Hu Hanmin, and Li Yuying, and they have repeatedly talked about Cai. I also went to the mausoleum of the 总理 to offer a wreath. The scale is grand and shows the perseverance of the revolutionary government. It is also deeply 雄壮, which reminds people of Napoleon's tomb."</p>

<p>The bandit disaster in Zhejiang Province has reached more than 50 counties in a few months. The provincial government has ordered the security teams and water and land police regiments stationed in various places to assist in suppressing them. The situation in western Zhejiang has gradually subsided, but the coastal counties in eastern Zhejiang and their neighbors are difficult to suppress due to the terrain, which is full of mountains and complex ports and rivers, coupled with the fact that the bandit stocks are too scattered and rise and fall at any time. Therefore, in recent days, counties such as Ruian, Yongjia, Haimen, Jiande, Jinhua, Lanxi, and Xianju have been in danger. The county magistrates Yang Xuekai, Jiang Zhenlong, Yao Duan, Wang Maoqin, and Wei Junming have successively電逹 the provincial government. According to the report of the provincial剿匪指挥部, in addition to flying and电保安队, the first regiment of Liu Xiwenz and the third regiment of Zhu Mingtao, were dispatched to抽精幹星夜驰勦.

At the same time, the three bandit stocks of Xianju, Yang, Zhu, and Yuan, also united with the old troops of Chen Jiamou, a 西鄉积匪, and set fire and looted wherever they went. Zhu Siming, the provincial剿匪指挥, specially transferred heavy troops to驰往 yesterday, in order to make a鼓荡平. And in order to calculate the economic剿击 time, Zhu 指挥 also formulated a剿匪方略. It is heard that its content is based on the points of war, but the Guan 防甚秘, and it is impossible to find out the details. (12th)</p>

<p>Completion Ceremony Held Today</p>
<p>The seawall project in Zhejiang Province has been in disrepair for many years, resulting in huge risks every time there is a flood. According to statistics, the losses in the counties along the seawall have reached more than 5 million yuan. Therefore, at the beginning of the 18th year of the Republic, the provincial government specially adopted the suggestion of the Austrian engineer of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau to rebuild the new seawall and instructed the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau to formulate a plan and a budget for the project funds. After being approved by the provincial government, the funds were allocated in stages and the Department of Construction was urged to proceed. The entire project of the Yixi Datang, the first phase of the reconstruction, has now been completed. Dai Enji, the director of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, reported to the Department of Construction and asked it to send personnel to驗收. The Department of Construction believes that the construction of the new seawall in this province has a special nature in the national water conservancy project, so it decided to hold the completion ceremony this morning (13th) immediately after sending personnel to驗收. In addition to sending函 to various agencies and groups to推派 representatives, it has also requested Chairman Zhang Jingjiang to personally participate to show grandeur. (12th)</p>

<p>The Director of the Anhui Provincial Sugar Donation Bureau was re-appointed by the Special Commissioner's Office of Finance, with Gao Peide continuing to serve. The former director, Xie Shitong, was transferred to serve as a secretary in the Department of Finance. Gao has arrived in Wuhu and is expected to take office within a few days. The Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce sent a special telegram to the Anhui Provincial Government today to oppose the sugar donation, stating that the Anhui Provincial sugar donation was originally a pilot project. After Yuan Timing returned it to state ownership, even more abuses emerged, and the suffering deepened daily. At the Second Congress of the Provincial Federation of Commerce, there were dozens of proposals opposing it. They are requesting its revocation, but Gao has been re-appointed. Gao is an incarnation of Yuan Timing and has a warrant out for his arrest. The people of Anhui strongly oppose this and request that the Special Commissioner rescind the new appointment and end the sugar donation in Anhui.</p>

<p>Chamber of Commerce Organizes a Pledge to Use Domestic Goods: The Zhenjiang County Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee, believing that rising commodity prices and inflationary pressures harm both national economy and the people's livelihood, organized a National Products Movement Conference and prepared display cabinets to showcase domestic goods, so that the public can know that domestic goods are not necessarily inferior to foreign goods. Merely chanting slogans without leading by example will not only make it difficult to achieve the effect of resistance, but also easily invite ridicule from foreigners. Therefore, on the 13th and 14th of this month, lectures will be held at the County Party Headquarters, and on the 15th and 16th, lectures will be held at the Boxian Gongyuan. Pledges will be requested to permanently use domestic goods.

Now that the date of implementation is approaching, in addition to the rules for the implementation of the law being submitted for review and then promulgated by the ministry, the organization of all fishermen's associations should follow the legal procedure, with the establishment of the county fishermen's association first, followed by the establishment of the fishermen's association federation. One uses natural persons as organizational members, and the other uses legal persons as organizational members. The two are completely different. The regulations are very clear and should be communicated to all places for consistent compliance to clarify the procedure and emphasize the law.</p>

<p>Pawning Rags to Maintain Security: Most of the sojourning residents in Yangzhou are former subordinates of the Sun and Ma armies. During this time, wounded soldiers came to Yangzhou. Some of the unscrupulous sojourning residents would often take advantage of the situation, leading to undesirable acts.

The pawnshop gave him two yuan, but he angrily threw them away. On the 11th, the pawnshop did not dare to open for business. Other pawnshops were also wary. The county government, therefore, held a meeting to discuss maintaining security. As a result, additional police officers and merchant corps members were assigned to each city gate and sent to the 92 districts to protect the police teams responsible for loaning disaster relief funds (disaster relief funds will be distributed starting from the 10th and can be completed by the evening of the 12th, then additional personnel will be assigned). At the same time, Ge Zheng, the director of the Public Security Bureau, sent officers to investigate secretly. Upon encountering suspicious activity, they should report to the police, who will be dispatched by the county to coordinate with the military and police to handle the matter, in order to avoid negligence.</p>
<p>The Dog's Tail in the Collapsing River Saves Lives: Regarding the case of the sinking of the Pujilun passenger ship in the area of ​​Jiaxingqiao Liuxi, Zhou Yefu, an employee of the motor company, mentioned that there was a large black dog that stayed by the collapsing river all day long. It suddenly disappeared three days before the collapse. When the collapse was about to occur, the dog suddenly reappeared, lying down for a moment. When the ship reached the river and collapsed, the dog also entered the water and swam ashore. Its tail was held by a person who was able to survive. It was found to be a Wang from the east乡. This is also a strange event.</p>

<p>Water and Land Police Teams Jointly Suppress Bandits: Recently, a large group of bandits has gathered at the border between Nantong and Haimen counties, causing great harm. The provincial government, based on the reports from the two county magistrates of Tonghai, dispatched water and land provincial police teams and two shallow-water warships to jointly block and suppress them. Li Changjiang, the commander of the provincial police team, arrived in Tongzhou on the 11th to supervise the team's suppression.</p>
<p>Establishment of Market Police in Various Markets in Tongtai: In the areas west of the Fan Gong Dike in the Tongtai region of Huainan, the duties of anti-smuggling and arresting thieves are handled by the anti-smuggling camp. The area east of the dike is very large. The various markets in the two regions are jointly establishing market police. The necessary expenses are collected from the barrel price. It has been decided to be jointly managed by officials and merchants. Two major police teams will be temporarily established. One major team headquarters will be set up in Nantong and one in Dongtai. The establishment has been approved by the Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Comforting and Recruiting Refugees in the Eastern Districts: Since the bandit riots last autumn in the eastern districts of Tongyi, the wealthy households have fled. Recently, the bandit forces have gradually subsided, and the administrative organs have been reorganized. Those who fled are being persuaded to return to their villages. Those who were coerced into becoming bandits are allowed to rehabilitate themselves and be exempted from investigation. Water and land transportation will be repaired and restored to its original condition in the shortest possible time. The provincial and county police teams stationed in the territory are deeply concerned about the remaining bandits fleeing and are implementing daily patrols.</p>

<p>Two Robbery Cases in Broad Daylight: (1) Zhou Xingsheng, an apprentice at the Yuanlixiang Kerosene Store in Cuiyaqian, this city, held 18 payment orders yesterday (10th) morning, totaling more than 2,000 yuan in silver, to register the dates at the Shunda Store in Jiangdong. Unexpectedly, on his way back, he was robbed by a bandit on the old Jiang Bridge, and the entire package of payment orders was snatched and fled. The police were immediately notified to pursue the bandit. Fan Qihua and other officers from the post there chased the bandit to the Xinyuanji gate at the entrance of Jiangdong Gray Street, where they caught him and found the stolen goods. The bandit confessed his name as Xin Xiaogou, a native of this county who lives in Taogong Mountain and makes a living by fishing. He admitted to robbing the package of payment orders. The director of the office immediately presented the bandit to the City Public Security Bureau for interrogation. (2) Five bandits suddenly arrived near Zhonggong Temple, Jiangdong, this city, at about 5:00 PM yesterday (10th), each holding a pistol. They robbed seven stores in a row, including Liang Shaoji Rice Store, Jishun Cotton Store, and Sanyangtai Native Goods Store, for a loss of more than 500 yuan. After obtaining the stolen goods, the bandits fled towards Shitou Road. Villagers rang the bell to gather a crowd to encircle them. Near Zhou Shuidu, they captured four bandits: Wang Abao, Zhou Shao, Xu Zhaohai, and Wang Agan. The third team of the patrol team stationed at Lingxian Temple temporarily detained them and scheduled them to be sent to the City Public Security Bureau for interrogation today.</p>
<p>Scheduled Repair of the Xinjian Bridge: The Xinjian Bridge Management Office decided to repair the bridgehead of the Xinjian Bridge from the 20th to the 23rd of this month.

A total of 204 taels of Sichuan opium and 52 taels of fake opium were burned. Many people, including Zuo Jian of the County Party Headquarters, Mao Zhongdan, the supervisor of the Customs Supervisory Office, and representatives from the court and public security bureau, were present to supervise. Because this batch of opium was relatively small, lime water was mixed with the opium and poured into the river to save time.</p>

<p>Public Criticism of Unburned Opium: During the June 3rd commemoration of Lin Zexu's 90th anniversary of opium prohibition, the county government publicly burned more than 50 opium pipes, lamps, and trays in the Yimiao Temple. Local public opinion has been expressing dissatisfaction that the county government, according to the report of Shen Xianheng, the acting director of the Baiguan Public Security Branch Bureau, seized a female trafficker named Fan Lu in a Caojiang boat on December 5th of last year and seized 60 taels of opium. This opium is still stored in the accounting office and was not burned on that day.</p>
<p>Communist Zhen Yuqing and Others Executed in Shanghai: Zhen Yuqing, a native of Gaotabu, North Gate Street, in the city, was 37 years old and worked for a coal company in the French Concession of Shanghai. In May, he and his fellow villager, Pan Atang, a coppersmith, were arrested in Shanghai for participating in a secret Communist Party meeting. At the same time, about 100 people were arrested. After interrogation by the military and political authorities, it was reported that a total of more than 30 people were sentenced to death. Zhen and Pan were among them and were executed by firing squad in Longhua earlier this month. Zhen's family still has four people in his original hometown: his parents, wife, and younger brother. His father, Laiyou, and younger brother, Fuqing, are all farmers who support themselves. An elder sister works as a servant in Shanghai. Pan is the cousin of Pan Axing, who runs the Pan Juxing Copper Shop at Xinjiekou in this city. His father is deceased, and his mother is alive. Both families are extremely poor.

<p>The Fifth District Organizes a Patrol Team to Defend Against Bandits: More than a thousand bandits have recently been discovered in the area of Sanjuesi Town, which borders Hefeiliu and three counties of Shou. They are carrying out robberies and kidnappings. The residents are fleeing. County Magistrate Wang plans to join forces with the Third Detachment after they arrive in Hefei to suppress the bandits. However, all sectors of the city are concerned about the tense city defense and have repeatedly held meetings to decide to organize a patrol team of the five districts in the city. Each district will send fifty people to patrol day and night to assist the military and police. The team was formed on the 7th.</p>
<p>Dispute Over the Change of Director of the Changlin Public Security Bureau: After Wang Xianxing, the director of the Changlinhe Public Security Bureau, was accused and removed from office, the County Government appointed Zhang Qi, the former director of the Changlinhe Public Security Bureau, as acting director. The Civil Affairs Office appointed Wu Jian to go to Changlin to take over. However, because Zhang had a good relationship with the local community, various businesses vowed to keep him, sending public telegrams to the Civil Affairs Office requesting the revocation of the order and refusing the new appointment. Wu was in a dilemma and also telegraphed the province for instructions.</p>

<p>(Omitted above) I respectfully acknowledge receipt of your newspaper's reporter's letter. I, Wu Zhikun, hired Dr. Wang Jielin on March 25th of this year to treat my hemorrhoids. Due to the strong effect of the medicine, I suffered severe pain for ten days and was in frequent danger. Later, I mistakenly used the raw materials of the Western medicine iodine formula, resulting in complete swelling and rotting of my anus. For several months now, not only has the fistula not been removed, but I have also been unable to leave my house for even half a step. I am suffering both physically and financially. At the same time, my old friend Qu Jun Hongda also heard that he was misled by Dr. Wang (this fact will be published in the New Pudong Newspaper). I believe that incompetent doctors recklessly use medications, treating patients' lives as child's play, and are truly harmful to society. Therefore, I entrusted your newspaper reporter to express this, so that those who hear it will know to be wary. I have specially prepared this letter to testify. I do not know if Dr. Wang searches his heart in the dead of night and feels any guilt. Please publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column to show the truth. I respectfully wish you peace. Wu Zhikun of Fengxian respectfully inquires, July 3rd.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Letter from the Fengxian County Chinese Medicine Association <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>We respectfully inform you that according to the report of Wang Jielin, a member of the Sixth Branch of our association, he was quite surprised to see a report in the newspaper about a member's malpractice causing death. The reason is that Qu Hongkui was suffering from a boil. He first sought treatment from Dr. Zhang Yunjie in the same town and then invited our member to treat him. The situation was already thorny (word as in the original text). Later, several doctors were consulted for treatment, but none were effective. After a week, he went to Shilong Hospital in Shanghai for treatment, which was ineffective, and he died the next day. This matter has nothing to do with our member. Also, Wu Zhikun, the section chief of the Finance Bureau, suffered from hemorrhoids. Introduced by Wang Xizhang, the judicial clerk of the county government, he was repeatedly treated in Nanyi in March of last spring and has recovered. There were no accidents. Why is this matter reported in the New Shen and New Pudong newspapers? It is very hateful. After investigation, it was found that non-members intentionally fabricated this. It is likely that the reporter heard false rumors. Therefore, we specially request your association to make a factual statement so that the truth will be revealed in the future, which is for the public good. Based on this, after investigation, it was found that Qu Hongkui died of boils because he was not careful about what he ate, and the toxin exploded. Several doctors were consulted for treatment, but there was no way to save him. It has nothing to do with Dr. Wang. Previously, we read a news item in the "Correspondence" column of your newspaper about a malpractice in Fengxian causing death, which does not conform to the facts. Our association has the responsibility to protect the reputation of doctors and should send personnel to investigate the illegal individuals who spread rumors so that they can be prosecuted. In addition to issuing separate letters, we are corresponding and requesting that your newspaper publish the facts in the "Letters to the Editor" column to clarify the public matter.

<p>The Meiji University tennis team from Japan, a group of eight, arrived at Wusong around 9 AM yesterday aboard the Toyama Maru. They then took a small ferry to the Wayside Wharf. Those who came to welcome them included Mr. Hao Boyang, Mr. Lin Baohua, Mr. Xu Zhendong, Mr. Uchida and Mr. Kimura of the Japanese Tennis Club, and representatives of the Meiji University Shanghai Alumni Association, Mr. Maruyama and Mr. Yama. After disembarking, they went directly to the Mitsubishi Club on Route Lafayette (present-day Fuxing Road) to stay. They played their first match against the China and University teams yesterday, with good results. Today at 3 PM, they will compete against the Japanese residents.</p>

<p>The match between Meiji and the Chinese team, with two singles and one doubles match, was a best-of-five-sets format. It started at 3:30 PM. The final doubles match started too late and was changed to a best-of-three-sets format. In the end, China achieved a complete victory. The match results are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e80">Singles...Both Matches Won <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Lin Baohua defeats Otakura. Lin Baohua was initially at a disadvantage in the first set. He excels at placement, but his shots lacked power, allowing his opponent to capitalize and lose two consecutive games. In the third and fifth games, he seized victory, slightly turning the tide to 2-3. Unexpectedly, the floodgates opened, and the momentum shifted entirely. Otakura consistently executed effective forehand and backhand shots, gradually gaining the upper hand. Soon, Lin lost the first set with a score of 2-6. In the second set, Lin was confident and his arm was powerful. His shots were like arrows, doing exactly what he wanted. Otakura was panic-stricken and at a loss, entirely under Lin's control and losing decisively 0-6. From the third set onwards, Lin was well aware that his opponent's weakness was his weak backhand. Eight or nine times out of ten, he placed the ball there, and he won easily. He was slightly careless in the sixth game, allowing his opponent to win. Lin still won the third set 6-1. After a short break, the intense battle resumed. Otakura was spirited, with great energy, alternating left and right hits, swift and powerful. Lin was troubled and lost two consecutive games. Lin regained his composure and regained the advantage. In the end, Lin won the fourth set 6-4, securing the victory. Umpire: Xu Zhendong.</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang defeats Okamoto. The two men were physically strong and their postures and attitudes resembled brothers. The techniques they demonstrated in the game appeared to come from the same source. Okamoto was fierce and won four consecutive games. Jiang won back the fifth game, then lost the sixth, resulting in a 1-5 disadvantage. The hundreds of spectators were disappointed. Jiang was steady and composed, and he continued to improve. He first made a strong effort to advance, then created a tie, and ultimately won the first set 7-5. The situation was similar in the second set with the two players closely following each other. Both men were extremely powerful, leading to many wild balls. Okamoto's serves were often mishandled, often failing to clear the net, resulting in his own undoing and loss of points.</p>
<p>A group photo of the China, Meiji and University teams (photographed by Wang Kai)</p>
<p>The number of these errors were quite high. Jiang was behind at 5-5 and then won 7-5. This was due to this reason. The two men took turns winning each game in the third set, with each winning two games at a time. Jiang went first, followed by Okamoto, then Jiang again, and then Okamoto reaching 4-4. Jiang then added two consecutive games, winning the set 6-4.</p>
<p>The total score was three wins to zero. Umpire: Ma Detai.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Doubles... One Match Also Won <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai defeat Matsuo and Sagara. Qiu served well, succeeding on his first try, and won two consecutive games. Judging by the overall situation, the skills of Matsuo and Sagara are not as good as those of Lin and Qiu. However, they made relentless efforts to win, and took advantage of the confusion of Lin and Qiu to win back two games. From then on, the teams were closely matched and Lin and Qiu were unable to maintain their advantage. Unexpectedly, after 6-6, the Japanese went on the offensive and won the first set 8-6, earning the audience's applause and praise. In the second set, Lin and Qiu stepped up their efforts. Their hearts and minds were in sync and these renowned players proved to be in a different class. They soon won the second set 6-3. When the third set began, the sun was setting and dusk was approaching. Sagara's serves were good, and their performance was slightly improved, but their resolve was shaky with mistakes. In the end they couldn't match the composure of the two veteran Lin and Qiu. As a result, Lin and Qiu won again 6-4. At that time, the land was vast and the ball shadows were blurred. The intense match came to an end. Umpire: Hao Boyang.</p>
<h3 id="e82">(3) Meiji Defeats the University Team <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Meiji wins two singles matches and one doubles match.</p>
<p>The University team wins only one doubles match.</p>
<p>Meiji played against the Shanghai Universities mixed team in two singles and two doubles matches, using a best-of-three-sets format to determine the winners. The matches also started at 3:30 PM. In the end, the University team only won one doubles match, with Wang Minshi and Zheng Tuikai winning, while all other matches were lost. The situation is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e83">Singles Two Matches... University Team Loses All <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Komatsu defeats Zheng Zhaojia. The two men both favored topspin shots. Zheng Zhaojia made aggressive advances and was able to respond effectively, but Komatsu was equally strong, fighting back and creating a fierce battle. The scores were very even, making it difficult to see who was superior. Later, Zheng used a powerful serve to defeat his opponent and win the first set 7-5. The situation was the same from the second set, with the two men retreated and hit groundstrokes from the baseline, with very few net plays. As a result, Komatsu also won the set 7-5, making the score 1-1. The third set became the focus of the victory. Both sides were cautious, worked hard on offense, and the game reached 4-4. Observing Zheng's ball momentum, there was a good chance of winning, but he lost too many points, leading to a loss. Komatsu also won the third set 6-4, making the score 2-1. Umpire: Detta.</p>
<p>Seo defeats Chen Guocheng. Chen Guocheng is a rising star in the Shanghai tennis world, and his tennis skills are also remarkable, especially his topspin shots. Seo, however, had deeply rooted skills and was very steady. Under the back-and-forth, Chen looked inadequate. He lost the first set 1-6. Chen improved slightly from the second set, but the score was still lower and difficult to surpass Seo. As a result, Seo won the second set 6-4. Umpire: Hu Xiansheng.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Doubles... Each Team Wins One Match <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Otakura (big) and Otakura (small) defeat Hu Qifeng and Hu Qizhuo.</p>
<p>The doubles match between the Otakura brothers and the Hu brothers began at 5:30 PM. The Otakura brothers were well-coordinated, with great communication, able to respond effectively, and handled the game with a calm attitude. Hu Qifeng and Hu Qizhuo, though well-trained, were one step behind, and were flustered. As a result, the Otakura brothers won 2-0, with scores of 6-0 and 6-3. Umpire: Zhou Jiaqi. The match only lasted for a short while.</p>
<p>Zheng Tuikai and Wang Minshi defeat Seo and Mike.</p>
<p>Of all the matches yesterday, only Zheng Tuikai and Wang Minshi won a doubles match, saving face. However, watching Zheng and Wang's score of 1-6 in the first set, their victory looked to be hanging by a thread. However, they were able to persevere and were not flustered at all, and eventually reversed the defeat, which was no easy feat. After the start of the game, Wang and Zheng’s attacks were clumsy, coupled with many points lost, giving the other side the momentum to attack, and they were unable to display their strengths. In the second set, Wang and Zheng seemed to see the light after a storm and cheered up. Their momentum was strong and coordinated with each other, leaving the opponent no chance to attack. They won six consecutive games and won 6-0, which was commendable. Thus, the battle of the third set became a matter of life and death. Both sides worked hard and did not give way to each other. The scores fluctuated up and down, and the spectators were also engrossed. Wang and Zheng continued to work hard and eventually won 7-5, creating a score of 2-1.</p>

<p>Although Ota lost, Harada won, resulting in a tie. As for the match progress, Ota's all-out attack at the beginning was countered by Testoni's solid blocking, which blunted Ota's attack and earned points.</p>

<p>After several back-and-forth battles, Ota only won the third set and eventually lost. Next, Harada played against De Morpurgo. The Italian player has won every match in Italy and is known as a "General Always Wins." He is a top-notch player, so the audience was full before the game started and everyone watched in silence. Harada's hits and receives were extremely skillful, leaving the German player unable to use his skills, and he easily won the first and second sets. Although there was a slight battle in the third set, the German player's intended light hit was ultimately no match for Harada's rapid attacks, and Harada won the third set, defeating this strong opponent.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Important Talk by the Supervisor of Students Studying in Japan <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Determining the Direction of Studying Abroad</p>
<p>Improving the Method of Supplementary Subsidy Geng Fund</p>
<p>Mr. Wang KeRen, supervisor of students studying in Japan, returned to China on official business the other day. The reporter met him on the way, and went to his residence. In addition to greetings, there were also important talks on education. The following is a brief description: Studying in Japan is near and costs less. There are many people who go there, so the supervisors have difficulty dealing with matters because the supervisors are of various qualities. The busiest months for the supervisor's office are March, April, May, June, September, because the Japanese semester starts in April and the graduation of each school ends in March. Therefore, there are many things to do in March and April, such as introducing admission and supplementary subsidies. The method of supplementary subsidy Geng Fund is not only considered bad by the Chinese, but also felt inappropriate by the Japanese. It is necessary to amend it. At 7 AM today (11th), a meeting was held with the vice minister, the director of higher education, the section chief, and the directors and counselors of each department of the Ministry of Education. It has been decided that, in accordance with the recent policy of the National Government to abolish the Sino-Japanese Cultural Convention, the supplementary subsidy Geng Fund will be re-established and submitted to the National Government for approval. It will also be requested that the Ministry of Education improve the method of issuing certificates to students studying in Japan, so as to remedy the situation. The Ministry of Education also intends to formulate a principle for students studying abroad as a whole, to determine the direction of studying abroad, such as the examination of the qualifications of students studying in Japan, the assessment of academic performance, and the management system for the allocation of funds, etc.</p>

<p>To Accommodate Children of Workers</p>
<p>The Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Education requesting the Jiangsu Provincial Consolidation Committee to instruct public and private schools in various provinces to give priority to accommodating children of workers. The Ministry of Education had previously ordered all schools to set up more free places, which already contained this meaning. It has recently replied that the letter from your office was approved by the Standing Committee and submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee, which forwarded the Xixian Consolidation Committee to request that the order be issued to public schools in various provinces to provide free places and give priority to admitting children of workers. The Ministry has been submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval. It has been copied and forwarded to your office for your reference, and a copy of the original letter has been sent to the Ministry. The Ministry has issued an instruction numbered 13000, requiring schools at all levels to set up more free places, stating that poor children in the school may be exempted from some or all of the fees that should be paid. The plan to improve national education and the plan to improve elementary education also stipulate that kindergartens and nurseries should not charge tuition fees in principle, and those that charge fees should still set up more free places for poor students. The so-called poor children and poor students already include children of workers. As for the admission of students, the children of workers and farmers should be given priority, and a detailed method should be established and implemented on a global basis. This should be replied accordingly. Please refer to the original letter for your reference.</p>

<p>Special Equipment Should Be Available for the Management of Female Students</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Beijing Municipal Education Bureau believes that private middle schools in the city are seeking to expand the number of students and are enrolling mixed male and female students. They are disregarding the various facilities that should be available for the enrollment of female students, resulting in many obstacles in school management and student life. According to educational principles and the principle of equality between men and women, co-education is of course desirable, but without appropriate facilities, there are often many malpractices. The Bureau yesterday specially instructed all private middle schools that, unless there are special facilities, they will stop enrolling female students from the 19th year. If it is necessary to enroll female students, they must first submit an application to the Bureau for approval before they can do so. Otherwise, once discovered, they will be severely punished.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Municipal Training Department Announces Results of Party Education Inspection in the City <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>14 Schools Should Be Encouraged, 41 Schools Should Be Corrected</p>
<p>A Total of 4 Schools Should Be Warned, Statistics for Elementary Schools Are Still Being Compiled</p>
<p>(National News Agency) In this city, many schools earnestly implement party ideology education, but not a few are perfunctory. The Municipal Training Department believes that party ideology education is of great importance. Without strict assessment and effective guidance, it is not enough to eliminate its malpractices and promote its progress. After two years of efforts and one or two inspections, initial results have become visible. However, the number of schools in the city, both public and private, is so large that statistics are already difficult, and inspections are even more difficult to carry out thoroughly. Therefore, during the last municipal training meeting, it was decided to proceed by district. Elementary schools would be inspected by each district and their fourth-grade students tested for comparison. Secondary schools would be inspected by the Municipal Training Department for dedicated responsibility. The details were previously reported in this newspaper. Now, inspections of both elementary and secondary schools have been completed. A total of 59 secondary schools were inspected (statistics for elementary schools are still being compiled). The achievements, both good and bad, have been carefully reviewed and graded. Schools that performed better were given encouragement, while those that performed poorly were given warnings, and the Bureau of Education was notified to handle them separately. There were also many schools where the second performance was poor but the third was remarkably improved. The effectiveness of the inspections can be seen from the following record of the third inspection results regarding secondary schools:</p>
<p>The following 14 schools should be encouraged: Chengzhong Middle School, Jianguo Middle School, Junyi Middle School, Guangzhao Middle School, Wusong Middle School, Huahua Middle School, Yucai Middle School, Qingnian Middle School, Wuben Girls' School, Jingye Middle School, Minli Middle School, Sanyu Middle School, Xinmin Middle School, Nanyang Middle School.</p>
<p>The following 41 schools should be corrected: Fudan Middle School, Guanghua Affiliated Middle School, Qinghua Middle School, Minzhi Girls' Middle School, Minzhi Middle School, Shenfan Girls' Middle School, Qingxin Middle School, Chizhi Affiliated Middle School, Daxia Affiliated Middle School, Peiming Girls' Middle School, Nanyang Girls' Middle School, Qingxin Girls' Middle School, Shanghai Elementary and Middle School, Dongwu Second Middle School, Dahua Middle School, Minli Girls' Middle School, Southeast Women's Sports School, Huizhong Middle School, Huiling Middle School, Zhonghua Vocational School, Pudong Middle School, YMCA Middle School, Huizhong Girls' Middle School, Fudan Shizhong, Renhe Obstetrics Patriotic Girls' Middle School, Nanyang Model Middle School, Danhua Middle School, Rural Normal Wuxing Middle School, Zhengfeng Middle School, Huzhou Travelers in Shanghai Middle School, Liangjiang Women's Sports, Meilun Middle School, Shanghai Middle School, Shangde Middle School, Zhende Girls' Middle School, Zhaoji Middle School, Biwen Girls' Middle School, Qinye Girls' Middle School, China Women's Sports.</p>
<p>The following 4 schools should be warned: Yanmaoshi Girls' School, Muertang Girls' School, Zhongxi Girls' School, Jinglin Middle School.</p>

<p>Joint Proposal by the Departments of Civil Affairs and Agriculture</p>
<p>County Government Ordered to Implement</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government yesterday received instructions from the Jiangsu Department of Civil Affairs, attaching the original text of the food relief and savings methods jointly proposed by the Departments of Civil Affairs and Agriculture, ordering compliance. The original proposal is as follows: "Regarding the matter of respectfully proposing for review and approval the food relief and savings methods jointly proposed in compliance with orders: We received instructions from your government, Order No. 694, regarding how to provide relief before the new grain is harvested and how to save and store after the new grain is harvested. We were ordered to jointly draft appropriate methods and submit them for your examination and approval, etc. In compliance with this, after consultation between our departments, we respectfully submit the following methods based on our limited views: (1) Relief methods before the new grain is harvested: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Rice Industry Association should raise large sums of money to purchase large quantities of foreign rice to be transported to various counties in the interior for continuous supply. Our Department of Civil Affairs previously submitted a request to the National Chamber of Commerce to raise funds to purchase rice, and the instructions have been approved. Now, we plan to order the county magistrates to jointly handle the matter with local groups, which will be easier to organize. (2) Issue a general order to all counties to allocate some of their stored grain to purchase rice in Shanghai and set up bureaus to sell it at a fair price. If the grain funds are insufficient, encourage local gentry and merchants to contribute to the funding, and ensure that it is implemented as soon as possible. Our Department of Civil Affairs has also applied for this, and upon approval, we will order compliance. As for strictly prohibiting exports from the province, preventing smuggling, and cracking down on unscrupulous merchants hoarding and improper consumption, we have already issued general orders and will conduct regular inspections to avoid negligence. (3) Savings methods after the new grain is harvested: (1) Vigorously implement mandatory grain storage. The regulations of the Ministry's Grain Storage Management Committee have already been issued to all counties by our Department of Civil Affairs, and most have reported the establishment of organizations. In the future, it is not allowed to substitute grain with funds. The Department will strictly implement this and hold the Management Committee responsible. When grain prices are low, they should raise prices to buy it, and when grain prices are high, they should lower prices to sell it. All losses are allowed to be covered by deducting a certain amount from the funds collected. If this is done, the grain price can be maintained at a balance, preventing unscrupulous merchants from monopolizing it. Promote credit cooperatives to use stored grain as collateral for loans, so that farmers' capital can circulate and food can still be stored. Hold the Grain Storage Management Committee responsible, and consult with the district chiefs to plan carefully and promote it together, so as to achieve results and gain practical benefits. The above proposed sections are the same opinions after consultation between our departments. We respectfully submit them in compliance with the order, and request your review and approval."</p>

<p>It is reported that the Shanghai Postal Authority stated that starting July 15th, all kinds of newspapers, books, printed matter, and packages can be mailed via the Shanghai-Nanjing-Jiujiang-Hankou airmail route. In addition to paying the regular postage for each category (if you want to register or express mail, you will also pay the registration or express postage), regardless of the type of mail, an airmail fee of 15 cents will be added for every 20 grams. However, packages mailed in Shanghai must still be inspected by the Shanghai Customs Inspection Office stationed at the Postal Administration before they can be accepted for mailing.</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Two-Percent Donation in the French Concession <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Notice of Temporary Suspension of Payment</p>
<p>The issue of the extra two-percent donation increased by the French Concession Public Works Bureau and the Public Concession Works Department at the same time has been repeatedly raised with the French authorities by the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession, who advocated for its cancellation at the same time as the Public Concession in order to maintain credibility. A few days ago, Mr. Fould, the Director of the French Concession Public Works Bureau, invited representatives appointed by the Chinese Ratepayers Association to discuss the matter together. It is expected that it can be implemented after another meeting. Now, the Chinese Ratepayers Association, fearing that citizens do not understand the negotiation situation and that conflicts may occur due to the collection of donations, has issued another notice to inform the public. The notice is as follows: "Regarding the matter of the French Concession Public Works Bureau increasing the extra two-percent donation at the same time as the Public Concession Works Department in the 16th year, our association has repeatedly raised the matter with the French authorities, advocating for its cancellation at the same time as the Public Concession in order to maintain credibility. Later, Mr. Fould, the Director of the French Concession Public Works Bureau, invited our association to appoint representatives to visit the bureau on the 11th to discuss the matter together. We went as scheduled and, after a long discussion, Mr. Fould agreed. It is expected that it can be implemented after further consultations. However, in the past few days, citizens in the concession have repeatedly inquired about the results of the negotiations and whether or not to pay the 12 percent donation. As this matter is currently in the negotiation period, payment should be temporarily suspended to avoid misunderstandings. We will issue another notice to pay after a decision is made."</p>
<h3 id="e101">The French Business Water and Electricity Strike <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Mediation Failed Again Yesterday</p>
<p>The French business water and electricity strike has been going on for many days and has not yet been resolved. Here is a record of the situation yesterday:</p>
<p>The general meeting resolved important cases. More than 600 workers gathered at the Public Stadium yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. The Municipal Party Department sent Xu Yefu to attend and provide guidance. The Public Security Bureau's Second District ordered the police to protect the meeting. Chairman Chen Puai reported that the tramcars of the factory had been damaged by attacks in recent days, and today it was reported that the water pipes had been destroyed. The factory was quite panicked. The Municipal Party Department has convened a party, government, and military meeting, and there are concrete methods for the strike, which can be easily resolved soon. I hope that all workers will unite and fight to the death, and not be incited by reactionaries, leading to accidents. Then, the following was discussed: (1) Request the Municipal Party Department to transfer Chen Qiaosong's detention case to the Public Security Bureau for handling in accordance with the law. (2) Request the Municipal Party Department to convene the news media to publish the news of the labor strike of this trade union as much as possible, and ask them to uphold justice to promote the awakening of the imperialists. (3) Request the Municipal Party Department to send a letter to the Public Security Bureau prohibiting the police from protecting the French business water plant. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Water pipes continue to be damaged. The French business water main pipes in the west of the South Railway Station have a total of four pipes: one 32-inch pipe, one 24-inch pipe, and two 16-inch pipes. The first pipe to break was the 24-inch pipe, which was immediately repaired. Now it is learned that the 32-inch pipe has also been broken and has not yet been repaired. The 24-inch pipe broke again yesterday. The French Concession's tap water has been affected since yesterday. Users are suffering from the turbid water quality, which is not hygienic.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau's mediation failed. After participating in the party, government, and military meeting the day before, the Social Affairs Bureau decided to give the factory another opportunity to come to its senses, and scheduled a second mediation meeting between labor and management at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Unexpectedly, the attitude of the capital side was still as strong as before, refusing to mediate and refusing to attend. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that the French business water and electricity company not only despises the Chinese authorities, but also remains unrepentant. All responsibilities for the future expansion of the strike should be borne by the company.</p>

<p>One Tramcar and One Trolleybus Each</p>
<p>Another Public Bus</p>
<p>One Driver Was Injured</p>
<p>At 8:50 p.m. last night, fifty or sixty people resembling workers gathered at the intersection of Rue Bayle and Avenue Villemon in the French Concession. A French commercial Route 22 bus, No. 213, was driving from the east. The crowd immediately took out stones and suddenly threw them at the bus. All the glass windows were completely shattered. At the same time, a French commercial Route 5 tramcar, No. 24, was smashed by dozens of people near the vegetable market on East Xinjiao Street. Driver No. 212 was seriously injured. When the police heard the alarm, they dispatched a large number of detectives to rush to the scene, but the crowd had disappeared. The injured driver and the car were sent to the police station and then to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, at 10:05 p.m., a Route 18 trolleybus, No. 164, was also smashed by rocks while passing the slaughterhouse on Rue Massenet. Although detectives rushed to the scene, no one was arrested.</p>

<p>The lights in the French Concession suddenly went out completely after 12:00 last night for unknown reasons. As it was the hot summer season, many residents and shops could not help but stay up late to cool off and had to use candles instead. As of 3:30 this morning, the section of the Great World had gradually returned to light, while the rest of the area was still in darkness.</p>

<h3 id="e105">The Organs of Baoshan Telegraph the Province to Strive for Subsidies <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The organs of Baoshan, because they heard that the Shanghai Municipal Government would no longer include the subsidies that should be allocated in the budget from the 19th year, so they jointly telegraphed to the provincial government a few days ago to argue with the municipal government on the basis of reason. The telegram is recorded as follows: "To Ye, Chairman of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government, Hu, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Chen, Director of the Department of Finance, Chen, Director of the Department of Education, He, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, Sun, Director of the Department of Construction, and Qiu, Magistrate of this county: We humbly examine Item D of the second case, Item D of the fifth case, Items B and C of the sixth case, and the eighth case of the division of governance between the province and the city. The Shanghai Municipal Government should subsidize the county's public security education expenses by 8,400 yuan per year, and the registration bureau and the agricultural farm by 2,000 yuan each. In addition, the county government transferred 3,000 yuan for local administrative expenses. Since June of last year, on the pretext of provincial funds being delayed, the county's organs have been cut off, and all economic difficulties have been impossible to make up for. We have repeatedly requested negotiations through documents and telegrams. We have recently telegraphed one after another to be allowed to send personnel to participate in the accounting. The old debts are still to be resolved, and it is heard that the Shanghai Municipal Government will no longer include the above-mentioned subsidies in the budget from the 19th year, which is very surprising. The record of the division of governance between the province and the city was previously approved by the National Government after being submitted to the Ministry of Interior for record. This is a matter of agreement, and both the province and the city should always abide by and implement it, and should not be unilaterally dominated. If the Shanghai Municipal Government violates the established case and stops the subsidies, then the seven districts and townships of the county can also be taken back without following the agreement. This matter concerns the survival of the county government, so we should argue on the basis of reason. We hereby jointly telegraph to ask you to examine and approve (provincial departments). Quickly propose that the provincial government will do its best to maintain it (county government). Quickly forward it and telegraph to the Shanghai Municipal Government that the resolution on the division of governance between the province and the city has not been abolished or changed by explicit order, and all subsidies should be permanently included in the municipal budget to maintain the original case and value the locality. At this time, the main subjects are eagerly awaiting orders. Wang Zhongqi, Director of the Public Funds and Public Property Management Office of Baoshan County, Pu Wengui, Director of the Education Bureau, Shen Jing, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Yin Shuqi, Director of the Registration Bureau, and Ji Zhonghe, Director of the Agricultural Farm, kowtow together."</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Rice Borer Prevention Propaganda Movement was previously carried out by the county government sending personnel to work with Chen Mengshi, the Provincial Rice Borer Prevention Commissioner, to propagate the campaign in various districts of the county. The work has now been completed and they returned to Shanghai yesterday. However, Commissioner Chen still needs to provide practical guidance on the sixth district's rice borer prevention methods. Moreover, this district is where the agricultural farm and the civilian education hall are located, so special attention must be paid to propaganda. Mr. Chen has scheduled to go to the countryside again the day after tomorrow, and there are still several days before returning to the province.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Match Industry Association previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to exempt all taxes on matches. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance replied to the association yesterday, saying: "We have received your letter requesting the exemption of various taxes on domestic matches. We have investigated that all domestic industrial products that have been approved to be handled in accordance with the Machine-Made Goods Tax Law are exempt from other taxes after paying taxes at the first customs station. This is the only way to give preferential treatment to domestic factories. The factories of your association members have long been treated in accordance with the above-mentioned methods and have been recorded, so there is no need to levy other taxes. As for Swedish matches, there is a situation of encroaching on Chinese matches. Our Ministry has previously drafted prevention and tax laws in order to urgently seek relief and has submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review and promulgation. There is no need to discuss the exemption of domestic match taxes requested by your association. The letter is approved for reference."</p>

<p>Minister of Railways Sun Ke recently stated that the passenger cars on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway are becoming increasingly corrupt, and passengers have many complaints, especially about the third-class seats. If this continues, it will not only affect the revenue of the railway administration but also be detrimental to the passengers. Three steps have been specifically defined to improve the situation. The first step is to send a letter to the Ministry of Military Affairs and the General Headquarters to order the troops stationed in various places that soldiers are not allowed to stretch their feet high and occupy seats on trains, so as not to hinder the safety of passengers, and to post notices in the carriages to make it universal. The second step is to strictly prohibit the sale of rotten fruits and foods on the train to emphasize hygiene, as it is the height of summer and unclean fruits and other items are often sold on the train. The third step is to strictly prohibit the road administration and train attendants from mistreating third-class passengers. If they dare to disobey, they will be severely punished once they are found out, and the general passengers are allowed to report to the stationmasters of each station if they are mistreated by the attendants. The stationmasters of each station should investigate impartially after receiving the passengers' reports and should not be biased. Violators will be severely punished.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Guan Jiong, Deputy Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Bureau, took over as the Director of the Shanghai-Baoshan Stamp Tax Bureau, he has worked hard to increase tax revenue. All new stages, such as the Shanghai Grand Theatre and the Guang Stage, have been affixed with stamps, and each sales agent is ordered to attend a meeting at the bureau every week to discuss sales matters and seek development. Yesterday, another notice was issued as follows: "(Regarding the notice, the stamp tax is a good tax in the world and a legitimate tax of the country. Since the stamp tax regulations were promulgated, after silently observing the social situation, it has been many years, and habits have gradually been formed. Recently, merchants and people know that the stamp tax has the effect of protecting legal rights. On the one hand, they fulfill the obligation of paying taxes to the country, and on the other hand, they enjoy the right to be protected by the people. Therefore, they are happy to purchase and affix stamps and actively implement them, and tax revenue has increased compared to before. The location is indeed in the central area of the commercial port, and the personnel are busy and the people are enlightened. It is indeed the crown of all places. The people respect national taxes and have sympathy. Since the Director of this Bureau took office, the examination of files and the audit of tax collection and sales have indeed been promoted more than before, but the cities and villages are vast, and the persuasion may not be thorough. Now, we are ordered to urge and tighten the collection, and we have to strive for progress. In addition to ordering the sales agents in the north and south cities to comply, we hereby earnestly notify the merchants and people to know that the ledgers and vouchers have been affixed with stamps in accordance with the regulations, and those that have not been checked or have not been affixed with the full amount should be checked and re-affixed. As for the delivery notes and money receipts, etc., they are the important vouchers for business transactions. Now, all places in Ning and Su have implemented compliance and affixed stamps, and the inspection is very strict. The shops in this port must pay attention to affixing stamps to the aforementioned documents and do not neglect to miss them. It is the responsibility of this Bureau to send personnel to investigate regularly. If tax-evading documents are found, they will only be punished in accordance with the law and cannot be leniently forgiven. Each inspector wears a badge when performing official duties and is given a license with a photo attached. The licenses of the inspectors dispatched by the previous Director have been recovered and canceled. Now, this Director has selected and dispatched inspectors and has re-manufactured licenses for application. In the future, merchants and people must affix stamps to all vouchers in accordance with the regulations and must not violate or omit them, so as not to interfere with the investigation and punishment. Special notice is hereby given on July 3rd, 19th year of the Republic of China, Guan Jiong, Deputy Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Tax Bureau and Director of the Shanghai-Baoshan Stamp Tax Bureau."</p>

<h3 id="e115">Negotiations on Secretly Increasing House Rent <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Ratepayers Association Sends a Letter to the Public Works Department for Rectification</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, saying: "According to the letter from the Chinese Ratepayer Lu Detai, our office has rented two shikumen houses No. 179 to No. 180, Funingli, Zhejiang Road, Public Concession, from the Xinlu Inn for six years. The house donation collected by the Public Works Department has always been calculated according to the house rent on the lease. Unexpectedly, this time, when collecting the house donation for the autumn of this year, No. 180 was not calculated according to the house rent of 143 yuan per month, but was increased to 300 yuan per month using the valuation method. We gave them the recent rent receipt for review, but they ignored it and forced us to pay. Therefore, we request instructions on how to handle this and negotiate to collect the house donation (i.e., municipal donation) according to the actual house rent, which should be an indelible principle. If arbitrary valuation is allowed, it will, on the one hand, encourage landlords to arbitrarily increase rents, and on the other hand, increase the burden on taxpayers. It is indeed unfair and seems close to illegal behavior. Moreover, after reducing the extra two-percent donation, using this method of secretly increasing the rent is even more improper. We believe that your bureau will not approve of this. According to the letter, we request that you investigate and order the rectification of this error, so as to avoid disputes.</p>

At the same time, Chinese Directors Yuan Ludeng and Xu Xinliu introduced the Director-General of the Public Works Department, Edward, etc., who greatly appreciated it and agreed to support the signing and issuance immediately, and wished the market success. All the formal business licenses were signed and issued by the Public Works Department at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, and Zhang Zilian personally received them.</p>

<h3 id="e118">The Success of Joint Operation <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Effective Trial Operation on All Routes of Zhejiang Sea</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Taiwan route, historically operated by four companies, saw the addition of two new companies last year. This led to intense competition among the six companies in passenger and freight services. Fares and rates were drastically reduced, making it unsustainable to cover expenses. After incurring significant losses, representatives from the Ministry of Transportation came to Shanghai and, through repeated mediation, a new method of joint operation was agreed upon this year. The six companies, Chuanshan, Daxing, Taizhou, Zhoushan, Ping'an, etc., established a joint office in the southern part of Shanghai. Each company sent a staff member to manage affairs at a designated desk. In terms of operation, revenue and expenses were combined for the six ships. The method of mutual dispatch of personnel for supervision was adopted to demonstrate impartiality, and all ticket prices and freight rates were publicly set, prohibiting private increases or decreases. Since the six companies began cooperating, operations have been normal, and revenues have greatly increased. The joint operation of the six companies' ships on the Shanghai-Taiwan route is based on the total annual revenue of 800,000 yuan from both passenger and freight services. The largest ship is allocated 135,000 yuan per year, while the smallest is allocated 120,000 yuan. Any subsequent surpluses or deficits are distributed or covered accordingly. Since the joint operation began half a year ago, the companies have jointly examined the business and found that it has exceeded expectations. Compared to the previous period when each company operated independently, revenue has increased by 40 percent. It is expected that by the end of the year, revenue will exceed one million yuan, breaking the operational record for the Shanghai-Taiwan route.</p>
<p>On the Shanghai-Ningbo route, this year China Merchants, Sanbei, Ningshao, and Taikoo, in order to increase freight rates and eliminate price reductions resulting from mutual competition, after consultation between Yu Qiaqing and various shipping companies, also adopted a division of labor and cooperation system. The four companies implemented joint operation. The method involved listing the annual revenue from passenger and freight services between Shanghai and Ningbo as a standard, and determining the share each ship should receive based on its usual business and tonnage. Ningshao's Xin Ningshao was ranked first, Sanbei's Xin Ningxing was ranked second, followed by Xin Jiangtian and Xin Beijing. The highest annual amount was 230,000 yuan, and the lowest was 180,000 to 190,000 yuan. Daily export and import cargo manifests were shared among the four companies for review. For the past half-year, the four companies' business, both passenger and freight, has exceeded the set amount, increasing by at least 20 percent compared to the past. The reason for this is that the practice of excessive commissions has been eliminated, and all proceeds go to the public.</p>
<p>On the Tongyang route, competition between Dada and Datong of this port on the Tongyang route this year has been intense. Datong has also built new ships, and both sides have exerted all their efforts to compete. Yesterday, Dada Company's Dahe Wheel and Datong Company's Longhe Wheel were ordered to temporarily suspend operations. The two ships were each ordered to load more than ten days' worth of coal and were scheduled to sail to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River this morning, where they would await deployment in Changyue. Outbound voyages from Shanghai to Tongyang will be reduced by two trips per week for the time being.</p>

<p>Correspondence Between the Public Works Bureau and the Dredging Bureau</p>
<p>The area along the Jiangnan riverside in the Nanshi Sixteenth Pier, such as the Cuifeng Wharf and Xuejia浜, is an area of land that had been leased from the Dredging Bureau by the timber trade guild and the bamboo trade association. Subsequently, due to the needs of the Public Works and Patrol Bureau, the timber trade guild subleased the land. This arrangement continued after the Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau took over. Recently, it was reported that the Jianghai Customs requires the aforementioned land along the river in Nanshi to inspect goods and operate offices. Therefore, they requested to lease the land from the Dredging Bureau. The Dredging Bureau replied that since the land is currently being subleased to the Public Works Bureau, it has sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau proposing to reclaim the land for its own use. The Public Works Bureau, after receiving the letter, replied that it is still uncertain whether this land exists given the new routes and coastline recently determined in the city. Therefore, it has prepared the latest map and sent it to the Dredging Bureau for review.</p>

<p>Announcement by the Citizens' Training Committee</p>
<p>The Citizens' Training Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters issued an announcement yesterday, stating: Regarding the matter of announcing, it has been found that the Ludong Yarn Factory Union Reorganization Committee and the Huxi Yarn Factory Union Reorganization Committee of this city were organized by personnel dispatched by the Preparatory Committee of the former General Labor Union. It has been many months since then, and not only has there been no progress in handling affairs, but the measures taken have been erratic and riddled with flaws. It seems that merely holding a false title will only mislead the labor movement. In addition to having already ordered the said labor unions to dissolve their organizations, all citizens of the city are hereby notified. If anyone uses the names of the said labor unions, etc., to swindle and deceive, they should immediately report to the committee, and they will be strictly arrested. This is for the purpose of public announcement.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Zhabei Labor Unions jointly warned Tong Shixiang, the capitalist of Zhufeng, saying: Mr. Tong Shixiang, during the drafting of industrial and commercial laws and regulations by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government in the past years, your absurd theory of distributing surplus in factories deprived workers of their benefits. The Commerce Press Union General Affairs Department, the Staff Union of the Publishing Department, and the Staff Union of the Translation Department jointly published a serious warning in the newspaper. Who knew that in less than two years, you would use cruel means against the Zhufeng Enamel Factory, announcing the closure of the factory without reason, driving all 500 workers to a dead end. Our associations have repeatedly received requests for assistance from the Zhufeng Union. After carefully examining the facts, we deeply feel that Mr. Tong's methods are harmful, and his intentions are dangerous, indeed rare among capitalists. Since the establishment of the Zhufeng Union last year, Mr. Tong has used swift and decisive measures to announce the dismissal of six workers and leaders who are enthusiastic about the union, holding on to personal grudges and disregarding China's industry, causing the labor unrest to prolong and the factory foundation to shake. Mr. Tong is not only a demon king who oppresses workers but also a parasite of the investors. When the turmoil ended, Mr. Tong uniquely signed employment contracts, stipulating that workers' jobs would only last for one year, deceiving and confusing them to the extreme, making it impossible for us poor workers to struggle, bowing our heads in submission, suffering from poverty and hardship. Anyone with a little conscience should consider the difficulties of workers and develop industry, upholding the spirit of labor-capital cooperation, and achieving coexistence and co-prosperity. However, in the past year, disputes have arisen from time to time, and oppression has been frequent. Today, using a trivial excuse, he used vicious methods to announce the closure of the factory. Although this case has already been handled by the party and government agencies, we are sincerely afraid that Mr. Tong will be stubborn and focused on his own interests. Therefore, we jointly issue this warning, hoping that you will immediately abandon your prejudices and restore work in the factory. The future of industry and the lives of workers all depend on it. Sincerely, with respect.

<p>Following the accident in the medicine filling room of the 63rd Ordnance Factory, the factory staff organized a post-disaster committee for the bereaved families, initiated fundraising, and submitted a request to the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs for compensation. An order has now been received for a compensation of 300 yuan per person. In addition to the 120 yuan for the coffin and burial expenses paid last time, the factory staff has collectively donated over 8,400 yuan. After the committee completed its investigation into the circumstances of the families of the deceased and injured workers, it was found that there were 23 deaths and 26 injuries. It is reported that the committee will distribute the funds separately at 2:00 PM tomorrow in the factory's main hall, with Executive Committee members Xu Mujun and others supervising the count. Each of the deceased will receive a compensation of 300 yuan, except for foreman Shi Changhua, who, due to his long years of service in the factory, will receive a separate compensation of 800 yuan.

<p>Claims to Have Killed Two Black Fish with a Knife</p>
<p>Unaware of Killing Two People</p>
<p>Jiang Xu, a woman from Wuxi with a history of mental illness, was admitted to the Xinpu Yutang Hospital for treatment of another illness last month. Unfortunately, her old illness relapsed, and she killed two female patients in the hospital with a knife. The hospital reported this to the local court, and the prosecutor filed a public prosecution for murder. Yesterday, Judge Zhao held a court hearing. The woman claimed that after recovering from her illness, she saw two black fish and killed them with a knife to cook and eat them quickly. She claimed she was unaware of killing two people and that she was possessed by vengeful spirits, not responsible for her actions. The judge deemed her statements incoherent and ordered her to be sent back to the hospital for further treatment and sentencing after clarification.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Zhu Jixing Case Scheduled for Sentencing <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Final Arguments Made Yesterday</p>
<p>Zhu Jixing, a deputy comprador at Wing On Bank, embezzled over ten thousand taels of bank funds and fled. After the bank accused the accountants Xie Tonghou and Yu Xiling, Zhu was apprehended. The case has been repeatedly covered in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Jiashi held a hearing, bringing the three defendants to court for final arguments. First, the police lawyer Gan Jingxian argued that defendant Zhu Jixing embezzled over 160,000 taels by replacing customer's bank drafts with bad checks, accumulating a large amount over time that he could not cover. When he fled, he instructed Zheng Hekang, a partner in his Dexing Sugar Company, to deposit a forged Yifeng bank draft at the Si Ming Bank. The Si Ming Bank discovered the forgery and detained Zheng. Seeing his plan fail, Zhu had no choice but to flee. He has now fully admitted to the charges and should be punished according to the law. Although Yu Xiling is suspected of collusion, his involvement is minor compared to Xie Tonghou.</p>
<p>Next, the defendants' lawyers Jiang Yi, Ping and Jiang Baoli defended, stating that Zhu Jixing acknowledged his despicable actions of forging bank drafts and embezzling large sums. However, his actions were driven by circumstances. Zhu had previously guaranteed debts for others, incurring significant losses. He sought to recover his wealth through speculation but was unsuccessful. His sugar company also suffered significant losses due to the gold-silver ratio. Overwhelmed by these problems, Zhu saw no other option than to flee, seeking a way to rectify the situation. The fact that he did not take any money with him suggests that he did not intend to embezzle. The lawyers requested leniency from the court and a suspended sentence if punishment was necessary. They argued that Yu Xiling was found innocent of any suspicion during the police investigation and requested his release. As for Xie Tonghou, he was acting under Zhu's orders, and any mistakes were Zhu's responsibility. The lawyers requested the court to consider these points.</p>
<p>After the lawyers finished their arguments, Judge Xu announced that sentencing would be on July 19th. Zhu Jixing was taken back into custody by the police, while Yu and Xie were allowed to be released on bail.</p>

<p>Wang Weizhou, a comprador for the Swiss company and a native of Anhui, recently declared bankruptcy due to his personal business failures. The company's general manager, Mr. Ai Fulin, has hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit with the Shanghai Special District Court, alleging that Wang has embezzled a large sum of 60,000 yuan from the company over the years. Yesterday morning, the judge held a preliminary hearing, but the defendant failed to appear. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that Wang Weizhou has reportedly fled, making it impossible to summon him. The lawyer requested an arrest warrant, believing that Wang is still in Shanghai and could be apprehended if a warrant is issued. The court instructed the lawyer to submit further information for review.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Puller</p>
<h3 id="e144">Suspected of Conspiring in a Robbery <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Suzhou Woman Robbed Upon Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>The night train from Nanjing to Shanghai arrived at the North Railway Station around 1:00 AM yesterday. A middle-aged woman, Shen Wu, a native of Suzhou, arrived in Shanghai with her fourteen-year-old son, Shen Jiacheng. They hired two rickshaws to take them to the Zhenhua Hotel at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Guangxi Road. However, as they passed the eastern section of Ke Neng Hai Road and Qipu Road, they were stopped by several robbers. One robber brandished a pistol and threatened Shen, stealing a suitcase containing silver dollars, clothing, and bank books worth over one hundred yuan. Shen shouted for help, and the local police station was nearby. Upon hearing the call, Hua Detective Wang Jie and Western Detective No. 263 arrived, but the robbers had already escaped with the loot.</p>
<p>After questioning Shen, the police suspected the two rickshaw pullers, Yang Asi from Chongming and Zhu Qingbang from Haimen, of conspiring with the robbers. The police reasoned that from the railway station to the Zhenhua Hotel, they should have taken the concession road to North Zhejiang Road, crossed the Old Garbage Bridge to Zhejiang Road, and then turned into Fuzhou Road. Instead, the two rickshaw pullers took Ke Neng Hai Road to the Qipu Road intersection, turning east instead of west, which was suspicious. The police took both rickshaw pullers to the police station, reported the situation to the chief, and were instructed to detain them and send them to the Shanghai Special District Court for questioning.</p>

<p>A Heartbreaking Story of a Weak Woman</p>
<p>Xu Hongzhen, a 28-year-old Tianjin native, worked as a policeman in the Shihui Port Water Patrol Team. His wife, Zhou, a 22-year-old native of Songjiang, met Li Jinfeng, a woman from Anhui, on July 14th of last year. Li invited Zhou to visit the Changsha steamer at the Huangpu Wharf. The ship suddenly set sail, and Zhou was unable to disembark. She had no choice but to follow Li Jinfeng to Qingdao, effectively being driven by Li. After spending a night in Qingdao, she met Li Jinfeng's lover, Tong Shaoying. However, the plan was discovered by the local Public Security Bureau, and all three men and women were detained. Tong Shaoying managed to prove via telegram that the two women were his wives, and they were released.</p>
<p>In mid-September, Tong took Xu Zhou to Dalian, where they met an (old man) who inquired about Zhou's desire to return to Shanghai. Zhou said she wanted to go, so she followed him. However, she was tricked into going to Changchun and sold to the Feihong brothel for 800 yuan. At this point, Xu Zhou was trapped and helpless. She managed to send a letter to her husband, Xu Hongzhen, in Shanghai, asking for help. Xu reported this to the Women and Children's Relief Association, which informed the Fengtian Association to contact the Jilin Public Security Bureau. Zhou was rescued and set off for Shanghai on May 12th, arriving on June 28th.</p>
<p>The other day, a friend of Xu Hongzhen saw Li Jinfeng, who had lured Zhou out of the country, at the North Station Hotel on the Concession Road. He informed Zhou, who took Li to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei for investigation. Li Jinfeng confessed that Tong Shaoying had sold Xu Zhou and that she was unaware of it. Li also said that she was bought by Tong into the Jinhong brothel in Siping Street, Changchun, for 200 yuan. A customer helped her redeem herself a month ago, and she came to Shanghai. The district chief ruled to send the case to the Judicial Section for review.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhengang, residing at No. 8 Dingsheng Lane, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, brought a woman named Zhang Erbao to the Second District Police Station, accusing her of causing his daughter to run away. He claimed that his daughter, Zhang Yunbao, 17 years old, worked at the Yunjian Sock Factory on Jiangyin Street, Xiaoximen, since January of this year. She was initially well-behaved, but after becoming sworn sisters with Zhang Erbao, another female worker at the factory, Zhang Yunbao's attitude changed drastically. Zhang Erbao often took Zhang Yunbao to the Great World amusement park. As a result, Zhang Yunbao became frivolous. Zhang Zhengang forbade his daughter from working at the sock factory to prevent her corruption. However, on the night of the 7th of this month, Zhang Yunbao ran away, taking 104 yuan in cash and clothing with her. Zhang Zhengang believed that Zhang Erbao was heavily implicated in the disappearance and requested an investigation.</p>
<p>Zhang Erbao, 22 years old, residing at Jinjiazhai Jin'an Lane, Chezhan Road, testified that she used to work at the Yunjian Sock Factory. Zhang Yunbao started learning at the factory in January of this year. She helped Zhang Yunbao learn the ropes as Zhang Yunbao was kind and well-behaved, so Zhang Yunbao had a good relationship with her. But Zhang Erbao had been bedridden since March of this year due to illness and had not fully recovered, so she had not been to the sock factory in three months. She also claimed that she had not been to the Great World or New World amusement parks with Zhang Yunbao and had rarely left her house. She claimed that she was wrongly accused of enticing Zhang Yunbao to run away.</p>
<p>The police station, finding conflicting statements, transferred the case to the District Court for trial.</p>

<h3 id="e148">A Dumpling in a Divorce Case <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Is it Poisoned? A Matter Worth Investigating</p>
<p>Qin Guangfu, a native of Qingjiang, has hired Lawyer Liu Xiang to sue his wife, Qin Sun, at the District Court for abuse and attempted harm, seeking a divorce to prevent future troubles. His statement alleges that he married the defendant, Sun, in his hometown during the Xuantong reign. After living in the village for several years, his wife complained about his lack of success, leading to frequent arguments. Later, a fellow villager helped him find a job driving, so he and his wife came to Shanghai. They initially lived near the Shanghai Military Camp. The plaintiff left early and returned late, while the defendant gambled every day. Upon learning this, the plaintiff advised her to stop, but she refused. The defendant was even more unruly than before. In December of last year, the defendant would frequently go out on various pretexts. The plaintiff tried to advise her, but the defendant accused him of having an affair. When the plaintiff returned home from work at night, the defendant would suspect him and force him to drink a large bowl of cold water before he could sleep. If he did not comply, she would verbally abuse him. This abuse was not unusual. Since this month, she has been taking his clothes and hiding them elsewhere. Arguments have been frequent. On the 24th of last month, the defendant wanted to eat noodles and dumplings. When the plaintiff returned home in the afternoon, the defendant said that she had saved dumplings to cook. The defendant cooked the dumplings and took them out. The plaintiff noticed that the soup tasted strange and was black. Upon closer inspection, several of the dumplings had a bluish-black color. The plaintiff was afraid to try them, but the defendant said loudly that they were not poisoned and that she would eat them first. The defendant then secretly opened the back door and poured the dumplings into the drain, intending to destroy the evidence. At this point, the plaintiff realized something was amiss. He rushed to grab one dumpling. The neighbors knew about this. The defendant usually neglected household affairs. After the plaintiff noticed the dumplings were strange, she tried to destroy them, which raised suspicions. Therefore, he requests a divorce.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Judge Zhao specially opened the First Court for trial. The plaintiff, Qin Guangfu, testified to the previous events and presented the dumpling as evidence for inspection. The defendant, Qin Sun, testified that she and her husband had always been on good terms and had no malicious intentions. She claimed that her husband wanted to divorce her because he had a new lover, who was also married, and that she did not want a divorce. The judge stated that the dumpling incident was important and needed to be investigated thoroughly. The judge ordered that the hearing would not be opened for debate today and that the witnesses who saw the event at the time should be summoned to court for further trial.</p>
<p>French Businessman Sapo</p>
<h3 id="e149">Sues Yunfei Automobile Driver <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Seeking Full Compensation for the Car Price</p>
<p>Mrs. Mije Demands Compensation for Losses</p>
<p>French businessman Sapo, represented by lawyer Ba He, filed a lawsuit with the French Court stating that the plaintiff's car number 630 was driven to the intersection of Fulili Road and Qiqi Road on the evening of the 9th of last month when it was hit by car number 12331, driven by Shen Yunfei of Yunfei Automobile Company at 77 Huanlong Road. The defendant ignored the red light signal and completely wrecked the plaintiff's car number 630. Mrs. Mije and her son were seriously injured. The defendant deliberately violated traffic regulations. The plaintiff requested that the court be ruled on in accordance with the regulations and also sought compensation for the car price of 2,850 taels.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mrs. Mije's representative, lawyer Mu Di Yi, stated that his client and her son were sitting in car number 630 when the defendant's driver's negligence caused the car to be wrecked, resulting in Mrs. Mije's serious injury. She is still in the hospital and has not yet recovered. According to the Western doctor's examination, Mrs. Mije suffered severe internal injuries that will be difficult to recover from. Since Mrs. Mije runs a Western-style clothing store and earns 2,000 yuan per month, she had to hire a replacement, paying a monthly salary of 500 yuan. The loss should be compensated for at least 10,000 taels. The son was also injured in the brain, which should be compensated for 500 taels.</p>
<p>Western Detective Captain Sa Cai Er testified that the accident was caused by the defendant's driver violating the regulations. Police regulations require cars to slow down when driving through the area and pay attention to whether the standing officer is signaling a red light. Detectives No. 21 (Chinese) and No. 407 (Vietnamese) testified that the red light was on that evening, and the defendant should have stopped. However, the defendant ignored the signal, causing the accident, which is undeniable. The court was asked to investigate.</p>
<p>The defendant, represented by lawyer Ti Baike, argued that the case was a traffic violation, and the plaintiff's request for an incidental civil suit was inappropriate. The lawyer declined to comment on the cause of the accident, saying that it was difficult to prove who was at fault. The defendant's car saw a green light from the officer when it arrived at the intersection, so the defendant proceeded. The police officers had the responsibility to prove the defendant's fault. The lawyer asked the court to dismiss the case. After a lengthy exchange between the lawyers, the Chinese and Western judges announced that the arguments were over and that they would decide on the case.</p>

<p>Fined 1,300 Yuan</p>
<p>Ding Guisheng from Jiangbei transported 51 pounds of opium to Shanghai from another port. When the boat arrived at a wharf in the French Concession, he put the opium in burlap sacks and colluded with a car driver, Song Yibao, to load it onto the car. As they were about to drive off, a detective from the French Police Station spotted them and approached to search. Song ignored him and sped off toward the Public Concession. The detective blew his whistle, and the car was intercepted. Ding and Song were taken to the police station along with the car and ordered to post bail. The case was sent to the French Court for investigation. The police chief reported that the opium was worth 2,600 yuan and requested a ruling. Ding and Song admitted to colluding to transport the opium. The Chinese and Western judges fined both defendants 1,300 yuan to be confiscated, and the opium was confiscated.</p>

<p>Had Transported Four Times Previously</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 8:30 AM, Officer Ye of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei led police officers to inspect pedestrians near the Gengxin Stage on Mongolia Road. They saw a certain man riding a vehicle at high speed, appearing very flustered. The police immediately stopped him and searched him, finding ten boxes of red pills around his waist, each box containing one thousand pills. The man and the evidence were taken to the station. The man confessed that his name was Li Tongzhong, a 25-year-old from Tancheng, Shandong Province, residing at No. 16 Siping Lane, Haichang Road, Zhabei. He worked as a laborer and had been transporting drugs for others four times. This morning, he picked up ten boxes of red pills from the French Concession to be delivered to the Longtou house at the North Railway Station for transport to other ports. Director Yao ruled that Li Tongzhong was transporting a large quantity of drugs for others, showing disregard for the law. He ordered Li to be handed over to the Judicial Section for investigation.</p>

Yesterday morning, prosecutor Guo from the Shanghai Special District Court arrived at the office to verify the cause of death. Since neither of the deceased had any family members, the bodies were handed over to the Pushen Mountain Villa for coffin and burial.</p>

<p>Liu Shangzhi, a native of Anhui, currently residing at No. 345 Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai, was reported to the Shanghai Municipal Police as being a communist.

Various printed materials and international publications were found. Liu was arrested and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Yuan of the Shanghai Special District Court conducted a preliminary hearing. Lawyer Li Dishan of the police station stated in court that Liu was a law-abiding citizen, according to the police investigation. If the Public Security Bureau wants to extradite him, they should provide solid evidence. The police would not object. Liu denied being a communist. Since the Public Security Bureau did not send a representative to the court, Judge Sun approved the police request and allowed Liu to post 500 yuan bail for seven days pending further inquiry.</p>

<p>The gangsters from Ningbo, Wang Mingfu (aka Wang Minglei) and Wang Desheng, previously sent letters to Zhou Dingji Paint Shop at No. 419 Kusu Road, demanding 3,000 yuan. Shop owner Zhou Dingwen reported this to the Shanghai Municipal Police, who sent Detective Wang Debiao to arrest the two Wangs. The two Wangs initially hired lawyer Da Yaoxian to defend them. However, because the lawyer was suspected of inciting them to change their testimony, he was transferred to the prosecutor for investigation and barred from representing the two Wangs. The defendants then hired lawyer Ye Fikang to defend them. The case has been concluded after review by Judge Sun Yuan. Yesterday morning, the court announced that Wang Minglei was sentenced to one year and two months for the crime of attempted extortion. Wang Desheng was found not guilty. Four threatening letters and one bullet were confiscated. During the appeal period, Wang Minglei will remain in custody.

<p>The Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) at No. 19 Yuanmingyuan Road is currently in a building that was constructed 70 years ago. Due to the daily expansion of the association's business and the expansion of operations, it is now considered cramped and insufficient for its needs, and the building is old and potentially dangerous. Therefore, this spring, the committee of the association decided to rebuild a magnificent new association building within two years to reorganize its affairs. The old site and the buildings at Nos. 18 and 20 were demolished and leveled in May, hoping to start construction on a seven-story office building in the shortest possible time. To save construction costs and land, they also plan to build several low houses on the roof for hosting guests and lodging travelers, as in the old Dongdao Lu. In the future, the various offices of the association will be located on the seventh floor, with the other six floors available for rent. The land was originally the remaining land of the British Consulate and was acquired by the United States YWCA in 1921. In 1927, the association formally donated the land to the Chinese YWCA in its entirety as a permanent foundation. As for the construction costs of the new building, half of the funds are gifts from Mr. Karen, Ms. Toler, and several other Westerners. Barring unforeseen obstacles, the groundbreaking ceremony for the new building will be held in August or September. The new building will be the largest women's organization office building in Shanghai.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities reorganized the Wusong River ferry crossings, the ferries presented a completely new look. The ferry fare for each passenger was originally one copper coin. However, the ferry operators claimed that the cost of living continued to rise, and their income was insufficient to cover their expenses. Therefore, in April of this year, they repeatedly submitted requests to the Bureau of Public Utilities, asking for permission to increase the fare to two copper coins per passenger. The Bureau sent personnel to investigate the actual income and expenses of each ferry and then forwarded the matter to the Municipal Government for approval. However, the Tanzhi Bay West Ferry had a considerable surplus with a fare of one copper coin per passenger, and was ordered to continue charging the same fare. Subsequently, the ferry operator, Gong A'nan, disregarding the situation, followed the crowd and changed the fare to two copper coins per passenger. The Bureau of Public Utilities, after learning of this, considered the unauthorized increase in fare without prior approval to be inappropriate and reported it to the Municipal Government for a fine of one hundred yuan to be used for repairing the ferry pier. Later, the ferry operator formally submitted a request for a fare increase, but the Municipal Government, considering the livelihood of ordinary people, did not approve it.</p>

<p>The Hongkou Epidemic Hospital in this city was initiated and funded by enthusiastic public figures such as Zhu Jing'an, Chen Silan, and Xi Derun in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. Zhu and the other two were appointed as directors, with Lin Chunshan and Zhu Xiaofang as directors of medical affairs, and Dong Gengsan and Tang Jingshou as directors of administrative affairs. Their achievements were remarkable. In the seventeenth year, the hospital continued to expand, and there were plans to purchase land and build a permanent structure. When the Shanghai Municipal Government was established, Director Zhu and others handed over the hospital to the Health Bureau. Unfortunately, the Municipal budget had already been finalized, and there was no way to cover the expenses, leading to a de facto shutdown in the eighteenth year. Now, local figures, noting the increasing prosperity and population of the area around Hujiamuqiao in Hongkou, as well as the growing number of factories, and the inevitability of epidemics, have requested Zhu and others to continue operating the hospital, relying on their experience. It is reported that Zhu and others have agreed. On the evening of the tenth of this month, they gathered local figures at the Atlantic Restaurant to discuss the continuation procedures, which will soon be implemented. However, it is reported that Xi Derun has firmly declined the position of director due to personal reasons, and Shen Huachen has been appointed to succeed him. Furthermore, economic director Wang Shenfu, due to being overburdened, has been replaced by Zhang Peilian, who has been jointly appointed by Director Zhu and others.</p>

<p>Election of Directors for This Term</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the China Leprosy Relief Association has devoted itself to planning and relief efforts for leprosy for over four years, sparing no effort. Its enthusiasm and perseverance have long been praised by people from all walks of life. Yesterday (the 12th) at 4:30 p.m., the association held its fourth annual meeting at the YMCA on Sichuan Road. Directors and members such as Diao Xinde, Kuang Fuzhuo, Shen Gao (representative of the Health Bureau), Chen Lengseng (representative of the Social Affairs Bureau), Mrs. Xiao Zhiji, Zhu Shaoping, Cheng Lian, and Li Yuanxin, as well as people from all walks of life, attended. The meeting was presided over by Chairman Li Yuanxin. A detailed report was made, describing the various works of the association. Some notable achievements include publishing the Leprosy Quarterly, sending representatives to various ports to investigate the leprosy situation, and subsidizing the expenses of leprosy hospitals in various places. Last year alone, donations for the treatment of leprosy with the most effective chaulmoogra oil exceeded thousands of gold coins. In addition, the association took over the Hongkou Commune in this city, providing diagnosis and treatment. The final conclusion stated that the Shanghai Leprosy Hospital has been in preparation for a long time, but there is no suitable site for construction. The only hope for the future is to overcome all difficulties and see its early completion. Subsequently, Treasurer Cheng Lian reported on the annual income and expenditure accounts. Then, Dr. Wu Liande, Director of the National Seaport Quarantine Service, gave a speech, followed by Dr. Mai Yagu, Far East Representative of the International Leprosy Relief Association, who spoke on "Methods for Eradicating Leprosy in China." His words were pertinent and incisive. Lastly, Mr. Yu Zhijian gave a speech on "The Five-Year Movement for Leprosy Relief," outlining a grand and ambitious plan as follows: 1. Conduct a thorough leprosy survey; 2. Compile leprosy facts into teaching materials for schools; 3. Participate in urban sanitation campaigns in various places; 4. Organize a Central Leprosy Association; 5. Convene a national leprosy conference; 6. Urge the government to promulgate leprosy laws; 7. Build at least one leprosy hospital in each affected province; 8. Establish at least one leprosy clinic in each major city; 9. Hold a national student leprosy eradication speech contest every year; 10. Find ways to protect and nurture the children of leprosy patients; 11. Find employment for cured leprosy patients. If the above plans can be realized, it is certain that the scourge of leprosy will be eradicated forever. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide deep assistance to promote its early realization. By the time the meeting adjourned, thousands of homes were lit up. On the same day, the association elected the following directors: Li Yuanxin, Kuang Fuzhuo, Li Guansen, Cheng Lian, Li Denghui, Yan Fuqing, Diao Xinde, Han Yulin, Gu Enkang, Wu Jingyao, Mrs. Xiao Zhiji, Mrs. Zheng Yangxiu, Wang Zhiren, Zhu Shaoping, Li Qifan; honorary directors: Liu Hongsheng, Sa Kesun.</p>

<p>Rescue Efforts Fail, Drowning in the Riverbed</p>
<p>At 8:50 a.m. yesterday, the No. 2 shuttle boat of the Longmao Foreign Firm in Lujiazui, Pudong, was loading passengers at the Pudong pier and sailing towards the Shanghai Wuma Road pier. As the boat reached the center of the river, near the bow of a British warship, a middle-aged man suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. The shuttle boat immediately stopped its engine to rescue him, but the man did not resurface and drowned. Afterwards, the boat captain, Zhu Xiasheng, along with a witness, a passenger named Gu Amu, reported the incident to the water police station for record. It is reported that the deceased was wearing a white shirt, white pants, white socks, and black shoes, and was about thirty years old. It is unknown what hidden sorrow led him to take this ultimate path.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Reward for Finding Lost Stamps <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>When collecting ship donations, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance's urban area ship donation office prints a kind of stamp ticket to be pasted on the donation ticket as proof. This kind of stamp ticket is divided into several grades according to the size of the sailboat. At about 12 o'clock in the morning of the previous day, Sha Liuting, a tax collector from the Wusong ship donation branch, collected ship donations outside and returned to the office at the intersection of Waitan and Dongsheng Road. Sha felt an urgent need and placed the tax collection bag on the writing desk. After Sha returned from the toilet, he immediately went back to his lodging for lunch. Unexpectedly, when Sha went out to collect taxes again at 1 p.m., he inspected the bag and found that 47 sixth-grade ship donation stamps placed in the bag had suddenly disappeared. Sha, the tax collector, considered that the 40 stamps were worth a total of 517 yuan, which was a major concern. He was extremely shocked and immediately reported the incident to the branch director, Zhuo Xianggeng. After receiving the report, Director Zhuo believed that if these stamps were stolen and used by bandits, it would greatly affect the collection of ship donations. He immediately investigated the office staff and public servants in detail, but because he did not know when Sha, the tax collector, lost the stamps, it became a suspicious case. Director Zhuo immediately sent a letter to the Seventh District Public Security Bureau to request an arrest, and printed hundreds of advertisements, posted them everywhere, and offered a reward of six yuan to find the lost stamps. It was not until about 1 p.m. yesterday that a patrolman from the Seventh District, accompanied by an old woman surnamed Bai, sent the above-mentioned stamp tickets to the ship donation office, claiming that they were picked up on the road. This was obviously a cover-up. Director Zhuo, since the stamps had been returned, did not want to investigate further, and gave her the reward money and sent her away.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Soldier Dies of Illness While Passing Through Shanghai <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>At about 10 p.m. the night before last, an unidentified man, wearing white shirt and trousers, about thirty years old, collapsed and died on the Dada Wharf in the South City. The patrol police of the first district immediately found a pass and symbol of the third squadron of the first team of the Capital Police Headquarters on his person, bearing the name Ma Naimei, 30 years old, from Ninghai, Zhejiang, serving as a soldier in the squadron, and a public letter from the squadron, which stated that soldier Ma Naimei had been granted leave to return to his hometown for recuperation due to illness, and requested military police inspectors along the way not to detain or obstruct him. It was then learned that the deceased was Ma Naimei, who was ill and intended to return home by boat. Unexpectedly, his illness worsened at the wharf, and he suddenly collapsed and died. The police immediately reported to the district. Later, the district chief, considering that it involved human life, instructed the local head to report to the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy.</p>

<p>Recently, a strange construction company with the name "Weiye" has suddenly appeared in Shanghai, contracting various construction projects in this city and Zhenjiang. Initially, they use clever methods to obtain advance payments, and then disappear without a trace. It is reported that no one in this city has yet exposed this mystery, but two families in the Zhenjiang area have already been deceived and swindled out of thousands of gold. One of them, surnamed Cheng, has contacted the introducer, Mr. Fang, and Mr. Fang has published a notice in a well-known newspaper in Zhenjiang, urging the director of the construction company, Ying and Li, to come forward to resolve the matter as soon as possible, otherwise, he will resort to legal action.</p>

<p>Head Broken and Bleeding</p>
<p>Huang Hanqing, a native of Hubei, 45 years old, used to be an official in the political circles of Beiping. After the unification of the National Government and the establishment of the capital in Nanjing, the old bureaucrats of Beiping completely lost their livelihoods. Huang was sent to Shanghai by the government, without clothes or food, and was in dire straits. Fortunately, he received assistance from Mr. Wang Yiting, who arranged for him to be placed in the Longhua Reformatory and appointed him as a teacher. However, Huang's thinking was slow, and he was ostracized by young teachers such as Zhang Chunfa, and was demoted to class leader. However, Huang also borrowed two books from Zhang Chunfa and failed to return them. As a result, Zhang hit him on the head with a shoulder pole the other day, causing him to bleed all over his face. Fortunately, the soldiers stationed in the reformatory apprehended Zhang and sent him to the Sixth District Third Branch. According to Zhang Chunfa's confession, Huang Hanqing accidentally fell and broke his head. The case was related to injury, and they were both sent to the Local Court for punishment.</p>

<p>Thief Qin Yenao Apprehended</p>
<p>At the home of Han Daxian in Hanjiazhai, south of Yangjing Town, Pudong, six or seven local thieves with weapons broke into the house at 11 p.m. last night, while others kept watch outside. Han was not yet asleep. The thieves entered the room and pinned Han to the ground, covering his mouth and questioning him about where he had hidden the raffle winnings and gold jewelry he had obtained during the day. They beat Han all over with iron rods, causing him to be covered in injuries and unable to move. The thieves then ransacked the cabinets and boxes, taking the stolen goods and whistling away to the west. After the thieves left, Han shouted for help. Neighbors heard the sound and came to check the lost items, which included 300 silver dollars, six gold rings, one gold hair clip, and other gold jewelry. At that time, Tang Jinghuan, director of the Second Branch of the Third District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Inspector Wang Deshan were patrolling with police officers due to the unstable situation. They heard the sound and rushed to apprehend the thieves, capturing one local thief, Qin Yenao, on the spot. They took him to the station for questioning. Qin's confession was cunning and he denied any robbery. The station ordered the victim, Han Daxian, to be carried to the station after dawn for identification. He identified Qin as one of the thieves who entered his house last night. Qin then confessed that he was involved in the robbery of Han's house. Director Tang obtained the confession and immediately prepared a document to escort the thief Qin to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Zhang Qingchen, 36 years old, from Yancheng, living in a straw shed at the Xiaoshedu lime kiln in western Shanghai, because his brother Zhang Qinglai had a dispute with Hu Baojin over the collection of street light fees on February 16 of this year and was beaten to death by Hu, Hu fled without a trace. The case was reported to the Sixth District and transferred to the Local Court to send personnel to verify the facts and approve the arrest of the murderer Hu Baojin for legal proceedings. After four months of investigation, there was no result. Unexpectedly, the murderer thought that too much time had passed and took the opportunity to sneak back home the night before last. Zhang found out about this and went to arrest Hu Baojin without making a sound at dawn yesterday (around 6:40 a.m.). He immediately called the police and brought him back to the Sixth District Police Station. After the district chief interrogated them separately, according to the plaintiff Zhang Qingchen, 36 years old, from Yancheng, living in a straw shed at the lime kiln and working as a small laborer, because his brother Qinglai was beaten to death by Hu on February 16, Hu fled and has now been arrested, requesting legal proceedings. According to the murderer Hu Baojin, 28 years old, from Baoying, unemployed and living in a lime kiln, he gave vague answers. After the district chief obtained the confession, he immediately prepared a document and sent him to the court for punishment according to law because the case involved murder.</p>

<p>The Tongshun Customs Brokerage in this city hired a wharf boat owned by Wu Xiaomao the other day to load 300 bags of broad beans and sailed to the Longmao Warehouse Wharf in Pudong at 8 p.m. As it was about to moor, a tugboat from the Dale Company sailed from south to north, causing rough waves. The boat was swayed and shaken by the huge waves, and overturned due to being overloaded. The cargo was completely submerged in the riverbed. Several people on the boat fell into the water at the same time, but were rescued by neighboring boats and did not drown.</p>

<p>Freedom if They Don't Agree</p>
<p>Ding Lingzhen, a local woman, is 23 years old. Her father died early, and she struggled with her mother. At the age of 16, she worked at the Dacheng Factory in Yangshupu and was seduced by the foreman's concubine, who claimed that a worker in the same factory, Zhang Maoao, also a local, had not yet married. The woman was deceived and rented a house with Zhang Maoao in Zhoujiazai and cohabited there for eight years. At first, Zhang provided some financial assistance, but later, the woman relied entirely on her wages to support the family. In October of last year, the woman fell ill and was bedridden. Zhang Maoao disappeared. The woman suffered from poverty and illness, and her rent was in arrears for several months. She was evicted by the landlord and forced to leave the house. The woman then resided at the home of her sister, Wu Ding, and notified Zhang Maoao. Unexpectedly, Zhang ignored her. The woman believed that Zhang should not abandon her after their relationship began, and she regretted her past. She sought help and wanted to separate from him to avoid suffering. Therefore, she hired lawyer Wang Chengkuan to file a lawsuit in the Local Court against Zhang Maoao for abandonment, requesting a judgment to dissolve their relationship. Yesterday morning, presiding judge Zhao Zhenhai opened the second court for trial. The defendant did not appear in court because his address was unknown and he could not be served. The plaintiff, Ding Lingzhen, testified about the past and requested permission to separate. Judge Zhao obtained the testimony and asked, "Are you officially married or just cohabitating?" She replied, "We are just cohabitating." Judge Zhao said, "Since you are just cohabitating, there is no need to request a separation. If a father and son separate, it is to sever the father-son relationship. If it is a husband and wife, it is to sever the family relationship. You are just cohabitating, there is no need to request it. If you agree, you cohabitate; if you don't agree, you are free to do as you please. There is no such provision in the law." The woman claimed that she was afraid of future troubles, so she came to request it. Judge Zhao understood her situation and said, "You should withdraw this case. It should be recorded in the minutes that if the defendant has any illegal actions, there will be legal sanctions. There is no need to worry too much." The woman listened and immediately requested to withdraw the case, signed, and left the court.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Smell and Love by Ms. Yeh Hua <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Smell is olfaction, also written as stench. It is a terrestrial sense, akin to the eleventh sense. It's one of the external senses, evolved from the sensitivity of single-celled organisms. The olfactory organ is simple, its nerves located on the upper part of the nasal bridge, directly reaching the brown mucous membrane. It receives chemical gaseous stimuli. There are only six types of smells: medicinal, floral, fruity, fatty, putrid, and fishy; all others are mixtures. Odors like body odor are a mixture of burnt and putrid; rancid smells are a mixture of putrid and fatty. The functions of smell include environmental detection, food seeking, danger reporting, defense, nourishment, and relation to procreation. Males use smell to recognize females; animals that are not good at smelling do not reproduce well. Therefore, smell and love are like two wheels of a cart, or two wings of a bird, inseparable for even a moment. Now, allow me to finish discussing the bodily odors of women, which vary greatly according to their ethnicity, age, and individuality. There are goat-like smells, dried fruit smells, garlic smells, butyric acid smells, musk smells, and so on. Xi Shi, Yang Guifei, Jieyu, Xun Ling, and Xiang Fei were favored by emperors and nobles because their bodily fragrances were alluring. Those with body odor, even close friends and relatives, would be avoided and shunned, making it a major cause of estrangement and divorce. Furthermore, the bodily odor of celibate men is stronger than that of ordinary people. Some people use this to discern their chastity. Women's sense of smell is particularly well-developed during adolescence, and nosebleeds often occur during this period. Hence, the Western saying: "A nosebleed in youth is a sign of love." Strange smells from the nostrils, sneezing, and colds often erupt with the excitement of love. Leather smells can increase love and abnormal psychology between the sexes. There are many records of this. People are often moved by the shoes they love, likely because shoes are mostly made of leather; loving shoes is a disguised form of loving leather smells. Why do humans uniquely love leather smells? A certain psychologist said it's because it resembles their own odor. Floral fragrances are quick to evoke emotions. White flowers like gardenias, tuberoses, and lilies have the greatest power. Therefore, gifting flowers is an indispensable page in the history of romance. Women often close their eyes and deeply inhale the fragrance of their beloved flowers, lingering with affection.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Arthur Conan Doyle is Dead by Yu Ying <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The famous British novelist Arthur Conan Doyle, known for his detective novels, wrote over a hundred detective stories featuring Sherlock Holmes. All of them are widely popular and translated into more than ten languages. Many in China's literary circles have also translated his works. His fame is such that anyone who reads detective novels is sure to know him. Unfortunately, bad news has arrived. It is reported that Mr. Doyle passed away at 9:15 AM on the 7th of this month (Monday) at his private residence in Crowborough due to illness. Upon hearing this tragic news, the entire literary world mourned. It is said that Mr. Doyle's illness was caused by lecturing on spiritualism in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden last year. The prolonged effort led to illness, and his condition gradually worsened starting in early November last year. Unexpectedly, he never recovered. Mr. Doyle is survived by his wife and two children.</p>
<p>Reluctant to let go, as if facing a loved one. However, tuberoses, lilacs, irises, and other flowers can injure the voice, even causing muteness. A message to lovers: love flowers in moderation. Observe the orange blossom bouquet held by the bride, mixed with gardenias; its purpose is none other than to use the mixing effect of smells to reduce the intensity of the fragrance. The most beloved fragrance in the world is undoubtedly musk, likely because it closely resembles body odor and sexual odor. Musk itself is taken from the sexual organs of male musk deer. Persians use it to apply to their beards and foreheads to win praise. Muhammad had three loves: women, bodily fragrance and musk, and food. In our country, using musk to scent quilts is considered the ultimate luxury. Humans also have subjective likes and dislikes regarding smell. To a lover, even unpleasant smells are fragrant; to an enemy, even pleasant smells are foul. Breast milk originally has no fragrance, but a lover perceives it as fragrant. Foot odor is originally very foul, but a lover does not notice it. Could this be what is meant by "Words from the same heart have a fragrance like orchids"?</p>
<h3 id="e186">A Returnee from the Front Lines Speaks by Zhuang Yan <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, I met a certain gentleman at a friend's place who had just returned from the front lines of the Longhai Railway. We discussed several interesting matters, which I will recount as follows.</p>
<p>The First Teaching Division fought extremely hard in the front lines this time. During the siege of Gui De's Wan Xuan Cai's troops last month, they used bamboo ladders to climb the city walls. Wan's troops threw bombs from the top of the walls, causing many deaths, but they were ultimately scaled. Wan's captured troops told people that they were still terrified of the valiant soldiers in green uniforms, given their battle record. Once, the division discovered a deserter selling his weapons. He was later captured in Xuzhou and was about to be executed according to military law. However, Commander-in-Chief Chiang saw him and wondered how the Teaching Division could have such a cowardly soldier. He summoned him and asked. The man candidly replied, "I went to the front lines to fight, but my elderly mother at home was on the verge of starvation, as indicated in her urgent letter. I really couldn't bear to sit idly by. Therefore, I sold my weapons to get money to send home. Afterward, I still returned to the front lines to serve. Who would have thought I'd be arrested in Xuzhou?" Chiang heard this and was moved to pity, immediately pardoning his crime and ordering him to return to his unit.</p>
<p>Two soldiers from a certain regiment of the Teaching Division went to the regimental commander's office one day to request their pay. The regimental commander refused, saying there were no funds. They begged repeatedly, but still did not receive a positive response. The two soldiers resolutely said, "We are fighting against the rebels this time with the determination to die. Now, our families are eagerly awaiting pay, as urgent as a burning fire. According to military regulations, each dead soldier can receive twenty yuan in burial expenses. Why doesn't the regimental commander advance this amount to us? In the future, if we die in battle, we are willing to have our corpses exposed without burial." The regimental commander had no choice but to reluctantly agree.</p>
<p>The Central Army treats prisoners of war quite generously. Those who surrender their weapons are all spared death. The Northwest Army, on the other hand, is more harsh. The northerners are straightforward and kill enemies on sight, without regard for humanity or inhumanity. However, there are exceptions. Once, during a battle in Lanfeng, a groom mistakenly led his horse into enemy territory and was captured. He was taken to the division commander, who gave him thirty yuan and two large "heimo" (steamed buns), releasing him to return. He also cautioned him, "Don't eat all the 'heimo'. Leave a little to give to your comrades in the camp so they know the food here is good." The groom was delighted and raced back. He did indeed leave a little "heimo", but most of the Central Army were southerners, unaccustomed to wheat-based foods, and they all vomited after eating it.</p>

<p>(5) Words from a Rickshaw Puller</p>
<p>In recent times, Japan has been advancing rapidly in all aspects. Its material civilization is on par with Europe and America. However, the living standards of its common people have also been steadily increasing. Along the way, I spoke with a rickshaw puller and inquired about his living conditions in detail. His answers were quite interesting and sufficient to glimpse the truth about Japan's lower class. Therefore, I will briefly recount them. The rickshaw puller said, "After graduating from higher elementary school, I joined a labor union due to difficulty in finding employment. I rely on running and physical labor to earn a wage, which is barely enough to support my family. My average income is about two or three yen per day, totaling over sixty or seventy yen per month (Japanese currency). After paying the rickshaw rental, there is still some surplus for household expenses. I set aside a portion for my children's education because I deeply understand the pain of making a living without education. I am determined to provide my children with a full education so they can obtain better positions in society in the future. During the spring, various international groups come to visit. There are several groups touring throughout the month, passing through Nagasaki and sightseeing all over the city. Our income also increases sharply, averaging over a hundred yen per month. Then, we can also prepare for winter clothing. Although our profession is difficult, the domestic politics are enlightened, and local officials are dutiful. They provide various conveniences for the lives of the poor and can solve the problems of food and accommodation in the most economical way, obtaining considerable comfort. Therefore, what I earn from running around all day is used to support my wife and children. At night, the family gathers together to talk, with no worries about accidents. Its joy is indeed harmonious. (People of the country, listen!) Guests like you come from afar, traveling freely throughout Japan, which is very enviable. I live within the country but have only heard of the prosperity of Tokyo. For decades, I have never set foot there. It is truly the biggest regret of my life. With the convenience of transportation in Japan today, traveling between Kyoto and Osaka is as easy as lifting a foot. However, constrained by economic difficulties, my heart has the will, but my strength is insufficient. I don't know how many others in the country share the same plight as me. My only hope today is that my children will strive to improve their abilities in the future and earn a better monthly income, perhaps enough to fulfill my long-cherished wish to visit Tokyo. My eldest son is already eighteen years old and studying at the middle school in our town. If he works hard, it will not be difficult to enter university. Then, my later years can be spent leisurely, avoiding the life of a beast of burden." When the rickshaw puller spoke, his eyebrows danced, and boundless hope overflowed from his words. His far-sightedness is particularly commendable, and we should also express our utmost sympathy for his suffering under economic pressure. The living expenses of a rickshaw puller require sixty to seventy yen per month, which is equivalent to about one hundred and twenty yuan in national currency. The high cost of living can be imagined, and Nagasaki is not comparable to a metropolis. It is said that rickshaw pullers in Tokyo earn about one hundred and fifty yen per month, which is barely enough to cover expenses, incomparable to our country.</p>
<p>The Evil Shanghai has the Great Jiangxi Road and the surging waves of the Huangpu River with its passing sails, a Great River that takes physical form. The flower associations, roulette gambling, and gold exchanges are sources of ruin and disgrace. These three are the Great Rivers without form. Everyone knows that many commit suicide in the Great Rivers of physical form, but they do not know that even more are sacrificed in the Great Rivers without form. Gripping my pen here, I can't help but sigh and weep. Yesterday, I met my friend Mr. Chen at the exchange. He told me about a clerk from a money house who went mad due to a failed speculation last month and was on the verge of death. His causes and consequences are enough to serve as a warning to those blinded by greed and heading down the wrong path. I will record it urgently as follows.</p>
<p>There was a Mr. Zhang, a mid-level clerk in a money house in this city, earning several hundred yuan per year. His family had many members, and expenses always exceeded income, with debts piling up endlessly. In the midst of his helplessness, Mr. Zhang suddenly wanted to try his hand at speculation, hoping for a one-in-a-million chance. Once his plan was decided, he returned to his hometown to beg for help from relatives, gathering a thousand yuan to come to Shanghai. He then entered the gold exchange. The first time, he took a bullish position on one "pong" (seven taels), and the price of gold happened to rise smoothly. For every ten taels the price rose, Zhang increased his bullish position by one "pong." Subsequently, he became too greedy, thinking of becoming a millionaire overnight. Thus, he increased his position by two or three "pongs" every day. Who knew that the winds of change are unpredictable? Within two days, the price of gold suddenly fell from five hundred and thirty taels to five hundred and four taels. Zhang's trustee broker, calculating at this price, found that Zhang's gains were small and his losses were huge. If the price of gold fell further, the risk would be even greater. Therefore, he strongly urged Zhang to settle the price. Zhang, having no funds to maintain his position, tearfully agreed. After the settlement, in addition to the original thousand yuan being confiscated, he still owed two thousand yuan, which the broker advanced. But fate played a cruel joke. The next day, the market opened and suddenly jumped to over five hundred and fifty taels, and within a few days to five hundred and sixty or seventy taels. At this time, Zhang's friend still did not know that he had already settled his position. He called Zhang to congratulate him. Zhang, depressed and resentful for days, was further stimulated by the phone call. Therefore, before releasing the receiver, he fainted and lost consciousness. After being revived, his nerves were deranged, and he went mad. According to the doctor's diagnosis, his life was in danger.</p>

<p>After this World's Fair opened, it indeed caused a sensation for a while. Originally, there were already countless gentlemen and ladies during the cool evenings. Now, everyone wanted to join the excitement even more. Among them, Mr. Shi Guanping was most enthusiastic about charity work, and the initiators of this World's Fair were all old friends. They also grabbed him to be one of the organizers, assigning him the mission of promoting the fair in the newspapers and fulfilling the advertising obligations. At this time, some people also went to persuade the wives and daughters of the wealthy merchants in Shanghai to take out all kinds of precious ornaments to help raise funds. Those ladies and gentlemen were all charitable-minded. They were told how miserable the disaster victims were. "We in Shanghai eat delicacies and live in foreign-style houses. Who knows that they even eat grass roots and bark. Some even eat people. After a disaster victim starves to death, many other disaster victims who have not yet starved to death go to cut off his flesh to eat. It's pitiful that the starved person had mostly bones and little meat left. It was also said, "Your young masters and young ladies are truly enjoying themselves living in Shanghai. If they were in a disaster area, they would be starving to death themselves and would not be able to take care of the children. Two steamed buns can be exchanged for a male child. No one wants female children at all." Speaking of living conditions, drought means barren land for thousands of miles. Floods mean turning everything into marshes. They either live in the wilderness or climb on rooftops." Hearing those words, humans inherently have compassion, especially women, who are more charitable. The old ladies had already been chanting "Amitabha," telling their daughters, "Mr. So-and-so's words are correct. The children of the disaster victims are worthless. Isn't our family's Lai Xi bought from Henan by your grandfather for ten yuan?" This time, the goal was to have the families of Shanghai's wealthy and powerful people donate a little of their remaining precious ornaments. Gathering small amounts can also become a large sum. But to sell so many precious ornaments immediately would be a bit difficult and also a bit uneconomical. So they came up with a method: making a kind of charity lottery ticket called "Planting Blessing Tickets," where every ticket had a prize. On the third day of the World's Fair, the lottery would be drawn in public at An Kai Di. A few days in advance, all kinds of lottery items were displayed in the venue, indicating that the top prize was those kinds of items, the second prize was those kinds of items, the third prize was those kinds of items, and the remaining prizes from the fourth to the tenth also had gifts. The idea of the "Planting Blessing Tickets" was simply to broadly cultivate blessings. Each ticket was sold for one yuan. In addition to directly selling to guests in the venue, the remaining tickets were distributed to the organizers, asking them to distribute them among their relatives and friends. Some were asked to take two hundred tickets, and some were asked to take three hundred tickets. After taking the tickets, they were not allowed to return them. Even if they couldn't sell them, they were asked to advance the money because those tickets would be useless after the lottery was drawn. Those organizers were all respectable people in Shanghai. They didn't care about two or three hundred yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Gold Market Suddenly Reverses Course <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Rebounding Nine Taels and Three Mace</p>
<p>Turning from Weak to Strong, Market Shows Promising Signs. Yesterday, the 12th, the gold market turned from weak to strong, breaking through the 600 tael mark. Market sentiment was auspicious, and prices steadily increased, fluctuating by only two or three taels at the start. However, the difference eventually reached thirteen taels. Foreign exchange showed a slight increase, and market trading was relatively brisk. Buyers took the upper hand, mainly due to the continuous rise in cash prices. The August benchmark gold price required a premium of thirteen or fourteen taels, and there were many eager buyers. For bars, Fuchangxiang, Yuyu, Dafuxing, Yongzhifeng, etc., all increased their positions. Yuanxingyong and Yuanmaoyong repurchased after selling, while Yifengyong, Yongchengchang, and Wanxing, etc., all sold. Early in the day, large bars increased in price, then weakened, hovering around ninety taels. Later, buyers became very active, and prices soared. By midday, they suddenly jumped by more than ten taels, breaking through 602 taels quickly. Because it was Saturday, the market closed as usual. Yesterday, the price of spot British silver increased by another one-sixteenth, while forward prices remained unchanged. The price of silver also increased by one-quarter, and the exchange rate suddenly decreased by one-sixteenth.</p>
<p>In the end, it broke through the 600 tael mark. The opening price for August gold fell by 2.2 mace to 590 taels and 2 mace. Later, it rose from 89.8 mace to 94.2 mace, and Fuchangxiang, Yuyu, etc., bought in. The exchange rate remained stable. The spot price for Japanese gold, bought by Mitsui, increased by 1.33125 shillings. When the notice for the spot price was posted, it decreased slightly by 2 mace, calculated at 92.12 mace. However, the listed exchange rates did not move and immediately rebounded by 1 mace. Afterward, it gradually increased. The September British gold for Andahua and Bi Mutual traded at 6 pence and 375 mils, so the price of gold rose by three or four mace to 97.5 mace at 10 o'clock. Shortly after, it decreased slightly by 2 mace to 95.3 mace. Retail investors sold, and because buyers were persistent, it still rose to 97.23 mace. After 10:30, Yifengyong, Xieyu, Yucheng Yong, etc., showed a strong intention to sell, seeming to be heading downward. It dropped by more than 2 mace, calculated at 94.89 mace. Korea sold August British gold for 6 pence and 25 mils. After 11 o'clock, Fuchang, Yuanmao Yong, etc., actively bought, and in an instant, the market surged, suddenly breaking through the 600 tael mark, soaring by 6 mace, to 600 taels and 078 mils at 11:30. However, the exchange rate trading was quiet. After a while, retail investors, etc., sold, and it immediately depreciated by 1 mace, amounting to 599 taels and 56 mace. People's confidence was extremely strong, and those who had sold previously rushed to buy back, so there was even more demand on the trading floor. It had already risen by more than 2 mace, reaching 601 taels and 9 mace at noon. At noon, it closed at 601 taels and 7 mace, and then it rose by a few more mace, increasing by 9.3 mace compared to yesterday. This was a rebound after many days of decline.</p>
<p>The lowest settlement price was Yichang at 52 taels. The maximum price for half a day was 601 taels and 9 mace, and the minimum price was 589 taels and 8 mace, a difference of 13 taels and 1 mace (calculated according to the official listed price). The announced price was still calculated at 653 taels and 4 mace, a reduction of 60 taels to 52 taels. The recorded price was 600 taels to 02 taels, with a deposit of 600 taels. The opening price for goods in the morning was 90 taels and 03 mace, and the closing price at noon was 601 taels and a half.</p>
<p>Before the market closed, there was a surge in buying interest, with the transactions of each firm as follows: Fuchang, Xiangyu, Zhifengyong, Yongfeng, Yuanheng, Yongheng, Fuxingyong, Yuda, Yuankangxiang, and Shunli all bought in. Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, Taihengyuan, Yuanxingyong, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Wanxing, Hengxing, etc., had occasional transactions. Yuanyuyong, Xiangfeng, Chengfengyong, Yongchengchang, Yuchengyong, Yifengyong, Jinan, etc., had all sold. The transactions of the Dalian gang were roughly balanced, totaling around 1600-1700 bars. The attitude of the Guangdong gang was mediocre, with few transactions, and there were no large transactions for swap bars.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Saturday, the foreign exchange market only lasted for half a day in the morning. HSBC's listed prices were unchanged, but internally, the market was slightly tight. It was initially weak in the morning but then trended tighter afterward. However, there were no major changes, unlike the gold market's sharp surge, which had a difference of thirteen taels and had broken out of the 600 tael mark.

<p>Market Overview: The current trend of silver dollar prices, considering the time of year, suggests that the slack season of summer makes any thorough rise unlikely. However, the needs of the various ports and cities show such a demand that there is indeed a reason for prices to rise. Therefore, these two opposing situations have converged to form a wavy pattern in the current state of silver dollar prices, with particularly large fluctuations. In the past few days, the overall pattern has been a drop in the morning and a rise in the afternoon, with the result of a daily increase of a certain number of notches. New highs not seen this year have repeatedly appeared. Although there is no direct skyrocketing, the incremental increase in the wavy pattern cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Swap Prices (Silver Dollar): Trading was still active in the morning, but the balance of supply and demand resulted in a silver dollar price that fell by 1 hao and 2 hu compared to the previous noon, to 7 jiao, 2 fen, 5 li, 8 hao, and 7 hu and a half. Unexpectedly, market sentiment was revived at noon, and prices surged. The listed price was once as high as 7 jiao, 2 fen, and 8 li. The closing price was 7 jiao, 2 fen, 6 li, and 7 hao and a half, an increase of 8 hao and 7 hu and a half compared to the previous noon, and also a new high for this year. (Silver Swap): The market was slightly bullish yesterday. The morning market was still 8 fen, and the noon market opened at 1 qian. Additional water was still 2-3 fen. The banks did not list prices, and the silver market seemed to be slightly better than the previous day.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: The price of Jiangnan small silver dollars increased slightly by 1 li compared to the previous day, with both markets at 6 qian, 3 fen, and 1 li. Only 3,000 jiao were transacted in the morning market. However, the rising trend of Guangdong small silver dollars was even stronger. The morning market soared to 6 qian and 09 li, an increase of 4 li compared to the previous morning. The noon market continued to rise by more than 2 li, exceeding the 1 fen mark, to 6 qian, 1 fen, 1 li, and 2 hao and a half. The future looks very strong. Transactions amounted to 175 million jiao in the morning market and 100.5 million jiao in the noon market. There was still a demand. Copper coins also decreased by 4,000, to 384,000 wen, the lowest price seen recently.</p>
<p>Inflow and Outflow of Silver Dollars (Silver Coins): Yesterday was Saturday, and the banks' collection and release were as quiet as usual. Chinese merchants collected and released 1.12 million yuan, foreign merchants collected and released 1.78 million yuan, and various goods, exchange rates, taxes, and miscellaneous payments collected and released 7.89 million yuan.

<p>The public bond market and futures market are still booming. The morning trading volume was approximately 7.7 million, and the afternoon trading volume was about 4 million. Although various spot transactions opened higher, the market situation remains clear. Looking at the trend of various bond prices, they have slightly turned peaceful compared to the previous day. At the initial opening in the morning, market sentiment was good, with buying transactions dominating, resulting in an increase of 1 to several points compared to the previous day. The subsequent trading continued to be firm, with significant increases compared to the previous day. The two afternoon trading sessions saw no major changes. As a result, the "Disbandment August" bonds rose by 1.90, and the July futures and "Reorganization" futures each rose by over 1.00. Other bonds rose by about 0.50 or 0.60.

<h3 id="e194">Cotton Yarn Market Struggles to Progress <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Global cotton yarn prices decline, spot sales are sluggish.</p>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, mainly because the global cotton yarn market is trending downward, causing market sentiment to suddenly weaken. However, buyers remain calm and show no signs of loosening their stance. Spot yarn sales are becoming increasingly slow, and business from Guangdong merchants is also lacking. One yarn factory is selling off large quantities, with approximately 5,000 to 6,000 bales traded in both the morning and afternoon sessions. However, the market trend has remained strong in recent months due to the peak season. The situation for far-month foreign cotton is unfavorable, with more short selling, it is said.</p>
<p>The entire factory sold off 5,000-6,000 pieces of bid yarn. At the exchange, the morning session opened with weakening market sentiment due to declining American cotton prices, and Hou Sheng Factory dumped yarn, causing prices for all months to drop by 1.5, 6, or 7 yuan. In the afternoon, some traders took profits by covering short positions, slightly strengthening the market, with prices for all months rising or falling by 1 or 2 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 12,650 bales. Public Tai, Shen Yu, Tian Chang, Yi Cheng, Da Ji, and Chang Feng sold 300 to 1,600 bales each, while He Shen, Yu Da, Tian Cheng, Bao Chang, Xie Sheng, Da Feng, Tian Long, and Yi Long bought 250 to 1,000 bales each. The closing prices of the bid yarn are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>| Month | Closing Price | Change | Volume |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| October | 155.7 | Down 4 | 31,400 |</p>
<p>| July | 156.3 | Down 2 | 18,100 |</p>
<p>| August | 155.8 | Up 7 | 25,550 |</p>
<p>| September | 156.8 | Up 2 | 7,150 |</p>
<p>| November | 155.4 | Up 7 | 29,550 |</p>
<p>| December | 155.1 | Up 9 | 10,000 |</p>
<p>The customer appetite for spot yarn is gradually weakening, and spot sales to Guangdong merchants are slowing down. The total volume purchased by various merchants throughout the day was only 500 bales. Fellow traders purchased 100 bales with average prices. Guangdong merchants purchased 120 bales, Sichuan merchants purchased 75 bales, Wuhu merchants purchased 30 bales, Shantou merchants purchased 55 bales, Xiantu merchants purchased 100 bales, Tianjin merchants purchased 50 bales, Yunnan merchants purchased 20 bales, Anqing merchants purchased 15 bales, and miscellaneous merchants purchased 45 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market has turned downward due to a sharp decline in American cotton prices, with prices breaching the 1.30 yuan line. As a result, market sentiment is increasingly panicked, with retail investors selling off. Spot cotton sales have completely stalled, while Indian cotton is taking the opportunity to enter the market. Transactions in domestic cotton are becoming increasingly scarce. Therefore, the cotton market remains weak. The future depends on the weather and the state of American cotton, it is said.</p>
<p>Han standard cotton prices fall sharply. The morning session for Han standard cotton opened with a sharp decline in American cotton prices and weakened market sentiment. Prices for all months fell by 3.5 to 4 yuan. In the afternoon, some traders took profits by covering short positions, causing prices to rise by 0.5 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 35,800 dan. Sen Kang, Shen Xin, Gu Da, Da Chang, Cheng Tai, Chang Yi, Yu Yu, and Da Tai Xing He Shen purchased 1,000 to 3,400 dan each, while Da Feng, Li Chang, Tian Chang, Tong Xing, Yi Chang, and Zhen Da sold 600 to 5,800 dan each. The closing prices of Han standard cotton are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>| Month | Closing Price | Change | Volume |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| October | 35.10 | Down 3.5 | 85,100 |</p>

<p>Spot transactions are quiet. There are no spot cotton transactions occurring. Approximately 200 bales of Yao cotton arrived at the docks, it is said.</p>

<p>Government Report Estimates Cotton Acreage Reduced by 2.7%</p>
<p>Most cotton-growing areas currently need rain, and bollworm reproduction has decreased.</p>
<p>A New York telegram dated the 11th reports on the cotton market for the past week: The cotton market started weak last week but then strengthened following the government report. The government estimates that cotton acreage has decreased by approximately 2.7% compared to last year. After the report, local merchants and bankers sold off slightly, but when the October contract price reached 12.5 cents, the supply was absorbed. Subsequently, due to the better actual situation and excessively high temperatures in the cotton-growing areas, the market slightly improved. Although the current dryness is not yet sufficient to harm the new cotton, it is believed that most areas in the South need rain. At the same time, industry insiders expect the average production to increase, as bollworm damage has decreased on average. Private reports indicate that bollworm reproduction has decreased significantly compared to last year. The weekend statistics are attached on the left (units in thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Demand from inland areas of this city is not weak... Prices rebound by 0.30 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a new ship carrying 85,000 bags of foreign rice arrived. Including the previous stock, there are now close to 1 million bags. However, the ship "Mingyu Maru" that arrived yesterday was one of the last shipments of fixed orders. After this, except for new orders, all previously fixed orders have been fulfilled. Yesterday, the market saw avenues for sales in the inland areas of this city and flat sales. Market sentiment turned positive, and many speculators were interested, leading to a rebound of 0.20 or 0.30 yuan for various types of rice. The total market transactions included 1,500 bags of No. 1 Saigon, another 500 bags of No. 1, 5,000 bags of large machine-milled rice, 3,000 bags of small machine-milled rice, 300 bags of Kegai rice, and 3,000 bags of small machine-milled brown rice. High-quality rice was priced at 14.25 yuan, ordinary rice at 13.77 yuan, and medium and low-quality rice were all priced accordingly.</p>

<p>Wheat Continues to Fall by 0.60 to 0.70 Yuan... Market Sentiment in This City Turns Soft</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, prices for various months showed signs of near-term stability and long-term weakness. Although actual sales for the current month are not very smooth, the inventories of the factories are not abundant (the fact that spot flour must be priced according to the standard is clear evidence). Therefore, market sentiment in each session remained calm. As for the distant months, the quoted price of wheat continued to fall by 0.60 to 0.70 yuan. Generally, people expect that if the exchange rate can be further lengthened when the price of foreign wheat falls, the market value between Chinese and foreign wheat may become more reasonable. Therefore, market sentiment is quite weak. However, inland hoarders continue to absorb wheat, and short covering is also very strong, so the market has not seen a huge decline. Looking at the future situation, the bad environment may lead to stagnation. As a result, the current month remained unchanged, August fell by 0.05 yuan, September fell by 0.075 yuan, and November and December fell by 0.05 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Factory Sales of Long-Term Wheat Plummet <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Factory appetite for spot wheat is not open, and inventories continue to increase... Prices of new and old wheat fall by a few coins</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, prices for various months showed a trend of near-term stability and long-term decline. Since the current month is unrelated and the market prices in various producing areas have not been greatly reduced, the factory appetite is not good, but market sentiment can still be stabilized. As for the distant months, brokers close to the factories and some factories continue to sell off sharply, causing the market in each session to plummet. However, the Suzhou gang saw the price of inland wheat rise sharply and bought in large quantities. Unfortunately, the situation is extraordinary and cannot be sustained. As a result, the current month remained unchanged, while August to October fell by 0.04 yuan each, November fell by 0.06 yuan, and December fell by 0.05 yuan. Spot wheat market conditions are such that factories unanimously hold back and are unwilling to take advantage, causing inventories to increase. Many people are trying to sell off, so prices for new and old wheat have fallen by about a few coins. More than 3,000 bags of Kaihuangqiao, Zhumadian, and Xuzhou old wheat were purchased by various factories, it is said.</p>

<p>Land prices rise by 12 yuan... Shanghai prices also increase by 5 to 6 taels</p>
<p>Recently, the white lotus seed market has been particularly tight due to the rise in land prices. The previous purchase price was only 40 yuan, but now it has risen to 52 yuan, an increase of more than 12 yuan. At this price, the Shanghai standard is around 42 taels, which is difficult to match. Therefore, the source is extremely scarce. The previous sales price here was 33 to 34 taels, but it has gradually risen to 38 taels. Yesterday, the quoted price was 40 taels, which is still cheaper than the land price, so the market may rise again, it is feared.</p>

<p>This year's spring silkworm harvest in Sichuan Province is not abundant, and the unstable political situation makes transportation difficult. New silk has been difficult to transport to Shanghai for a long time. Yesterday, 47 pieces of new silk from Sichuan factories arrived on a British merchant ship. Silk merchants from Sichuan took the silk back to the silk shops for inspection. The silk quality is no worse than old silk, and the threads are more uniform than last year. Samples are being prepared, it is said.</p>

<p>More than 3,000 boxes of various green teas arrived yesterday. Except for a slight demand for secondary goods such as Zhenmei and Xiumei from British and French merchants, everyone else is watching. The market for Qining black tea is also deserted. Although the Russian Xiezhuhui is still reviewing Hunan and Hubei black teas and fragrant teas, it has not officially started business. However, the internal arrangements of the bank have been completed, and it is likely to start business next week, it is said.</p>

<p>Haichang cloth, fine serge, floral flannel, etc.</p>
<p>Piece goods transactions have been slightly sluggish recently due to the hot weather. The number of people arriving at the guild has been greatly reduced, and inland customers have also disappeared. Therefore, wholesale to inland areas in this city has temporarily stopped. However, Sichuan merchants are active. The stock is still low, and the road is longer. Yesterday, they called to add 300-400 pieces of Haichang cloth, 100+ pieces of fine serge, and has an appetite for floral flannel. However, most of the orders were price limited, so only 100+ pieces were transacted. Big rooster cages are 1.9 yuan and the same price for Yang Guifei. The medium rooster cages and Fuhua is 1.8 yuan, Yang Guifei and Qiba is 1.775 yuan. The Chengdu gang are purchasing more. The Han gang's printed straight tribute cloth, dark colors, Tingxu, have a strong appetite. The Changsha gang is stagnant. The Northern gang add slightly on bleached cloth. Erqiao is 8.3 taels, Fushou Sanxing is 9.7 taels. Half of the western goods have been active once, and then have become quiet again, but the market is very good.</p>

The selling price is estimated to be 24 taels per dan for No. 4, 23.5 taels for No. 5, and 22.25 taels for No. 9, it is said.</p>

<p>How Many Words Can We Really Use?</p>
<p>Talking, reading, and writing are things that people cannot leave every day, especially the former, which is needed by barbarians and young children. The tool for doing these things is undoubtedly the (word), but we have to think about how many words we can really use.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, Westerners have many interesting statistics. In 1860, Oxford University Professor Max Muller said in a speech that a British rural farmer skillfully used at most 300 words, but according to Dr. Kail Lokotsch, this statement is not difficult to refute today. He collected many novel things to refute Professor Muller's statement. The following are his words:</p>
<p>Mrs. Winneld SHall of the United States recorded the words spoken by her young children from the beginning of speaking. By the seventeenth month, the child used 232 different words, which increased to 2,688 words by the age of six.</p>
<p>This can only be regarded as a minimum number, because children always have many words that escape the records of their mothers and nannies.</p>
<p>German linguist Wundt also did the same experiment. He experimented that a two-year-old girl used 489 words, and a girl of the same age used as many as 1,128 words.</p>
<p>Therefore, Professor MMuller's statement is absurd. No adult uses fewer words than a two-year-old child. Moreover, farmers cannot but know many special agricultural words. Even the simplest farmer cannot live on 300 words.</p>
<p>An average person who has received eight years of general education in school and usually reads magazines, newspapers, and listens to radio lectures, etc., has a vocabulary of at least 10,000 or more.</p>
<p>But people who have received higher education are even more different.</p>
<p>Professor E.S. Hlolden once selected the words he knew in Webster's University Dictionary, which totaled 33,456 words. Mr. E.H. Babbitt experimented with his students, and most of the students knew no less than 60,000 words, which is even more amazing.</p>
<p>But we must know that recognizing words and using words are very different. Even if the words recognized are very many, only a few of them are used, especially in writing. This can be proven by the following example. This is Miss Liu Wofei, the daughter of Mr. Liu Yazi, the best graduate of the Preparatory Department of Datong University (photographed by Ye Changlie)</p>
<p>(The Iliad) and (The Odyssey) used a total of only 9,000 different words. Shakespeare, the writer with the richest vocabulary, used only about 20,000 words in all his works.</p>
<p>This is the situation of word usage among European and American cultural people. Let's take a look at the situation of many semi-uncivilized people.</p>
<p>Many primitive peoples have a surprising number of words. The 1550 Mexican Aztec dictionary already had 13,000 words. One investigator found that the Yaarans race, who did not even know about coats and trousers, used 30,000 words. The most amazing thing is the vocabulary of the Arabs. They have a hundred different words for calling camels, five hundred different words for calling awls, and a thousand different words for calling a sword. Everyone can imagine how vast the Arabic dictionary is.</p>
<h3 id="e213">The Sorrow After Marriage   Quiet <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Because of the proof of reality, she had to believe that marriage was the graveyard of love. Now, all she could obtain was boredom and sorrow. She regretted it; she regretted hurrying into marriage with him and driving away the sweetness and beauty of their love. Moreover, burying it deeply and forever in the grave; how could this not make her feel an unusual sorrow?</p>
<p>She recalled the pleasant past, the sweetness of life, and unconsciously revealed a slight smile. But reality followed, disturbing her. The smile of a fleeting moment would immediately be withdrawn, returning to the state where she only felt emptiness and loneliness. Her brows furrowed with vexation, tightly wrinkled, hating even more the demon that controlled reality. She unconsciously let out a breath and exclaimed, "Mother, is married life like this? Can it really become so unbearable?"</p>
<p>Before marriage, how happy she was! Not only were passersby envious, but all the relatives and friends who knew them were praising them, gazing with envious eyes. Even she herself was very satisfied, self-proud, and thought that the god of love was especially kind to her.</p>
<p>Not long after the marriage, naturally, it was still as ardent as before marriage, and even more joyful than before marriage; it was truly more than enough. But what was hateful was that the angel who governs love was no different from the gods who govern other destinies. It too wanted to make fun of people, especially those who would not escape the general rule that extreme prosperity must decline. Now, two years after marriage, all she could enjoy was the innocent laughter of her beloved daughter. Where had the deep affection of her beloved gone? Where had it gone? Some said that the innocent laughter of her beloved daughter was the price of sacrificing the deep affection of her beloved. Was it true? Was it really sent to pay the price for the innocent laughter of her beloved daughter? Thinking of this, her vision blurred, as if she had lost a treasure, a treasure that was forever difficult to regain, forcing her to feel heartbroken and to wipe away her tears silently.</p>
<p>After being heartbroken, watching her beloved daughter sleeping in the cradle, sleeping very quietly, she picked up paper and pen and wrote a letter to her friend of many years, saying, "If this is a letter, it is naturally not as poignant as calling it a lament after marriage." Below is the letter she wrote:</p>
<p>Yun Yao, dear friend, I am so grateful that you wrote two letters from afar to ask about my illness. At that time, I was ill, and furthermore, Qin'er was constantly pestering me. I really had no time, so I did not write back. Please forgive me. I believe you will understand me.</p>
<p>Good friend, how troubled is my heart now. This illness of mine was certainly caused by postpartum weakness, but it can also be said to have arisen from vexation. Because between my husband and I, there has arisen a secret pain.</p>
<p>What is my vexation? To be honest, it is that my husband's love for me has gradually faded recently. Compared to the love at the beginning of our marriage, it is truly like a gulf.</p>
<p>He truly cannot forgive me. He says that the love I give him now is not as ardent and profound as before, and I am not willing to give love wholeheartedly. This is truly wronging me! I wish I could take out my heart and show it to him carefully. Only let the god of love know my heart! He even said that I only know how to fully express maternal love and have left him aside. But, Sister Yao, you must know that when a woman has children, she wants to express maternal love; this is an expression of her nature. How can he resent me? Of course, I also know that in this kind of situation, a man, whether he understands it or not, will naturally always feel strange and lonely. But I also have no way to deal with it.</p>
<p>In reality, isn't he himself also changing? How often is he exerting his utmost to give love? In short, what I feel now is only mediocrity and loneliness. Fortunately, sometimes teasing the innocent laughter of this little thing will make me forget everything. If it weren't for Qin'er constantly entertaining me, I don't know how unbearable I would feel. Sister Yao, dear Sister Yao, do you think I am very happy? Do you think I am enjoying the pleasures of life to the fullest? Please see for yourself whether the married life I am enjoying is the pleasure of life or hell on earth. It is truly enough for me to enjoy.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, marriage is the hardening of love, but if one can prevent it, one can still maintain the delicate and deep feelings of the past. Sister Yao, although I know this, I cannot put it into practice. I don't even know how to put it into practice.

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3 id="e214">The Source of Disease and Treatment for the Chinese Nation by Zhi Jing, Gao Huaichuan <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>The decline of the Chinese national character, the Chinese nation's disease reaching the bone marrow, suffering from the poisonous roots of two thousand years to the point of being bedridden and lingering with only a breath left. At this moment, some people still say that the large Chinese nation is not afraid of being conquered by other nations, and even if it were conquered, it would assimilate them. Furthermore, some even have sores all over their bodies and still say that they are not sick. This is truly laughable and pitiful. Because of this concept, they fundamentally do not admit that the Chinese nation is sick, and naturally they do not investigate the root of the disease. Then, the question facing us is whether we Chinese have a national concept, and whether we clearly recognize our national consciousness. This is undeniable. The public is like scattered sand, only remembering their own family at all times. What nation or no nation, in their minds, it seems like there is no such thing. The author of "The Source of Disease and Treatment for the Chinese Nation" saw this point, so he frankly used historical facts to prove the incurable situation of the Chinese nation's disease, found the location of the disease, found the root of the disease, and, in accordance with the timing, gave a full dose of stimulant and wrote a good prescription. Such a creation cannot be said to be unprecedented, nor can it be called a pearl in every word, but in the modern Chinese nation, which has been poisoned for a long time and whose disease has reached the bone marrow, I feel that it is necessary to expose its shortcomings and find the crux of its decline.</p>
<p>The book is divided into sixteen chapters. As usual, the first chapter is the introduction, which describes the general views on the cause of the disease. Some say it is the relationship of the clan system, some say it is the geographical relationship, some say it is the political system, some say it is the academic relationship, etc. The author believes that they cannot be said to be completely wrong, and that they are all related to the weakening of China. However, "if we designate these few as the causes of weakening without attaching conditions, in fact, there is something wrong, and theoretically, of course, it is even more untenable. Therefore, I believe that the weakening of China must have another kind of thing interfering from within." Regarding this kind of interference, let's see what he says: "The weakening of China, as seen from historical events, is indeed a part of the responsibility that has developed a defect. The reason for the defect in responsibility is that a part is sick. Its function breaks away from responsibility, and instead is driven by the disease to promote the disease. After years of accumulation, it has created a 'sick man of East Asia'."</p>
<p>Therefore, in the second part of his work, he tries his best to expose the truth about this part of the responsibility that has developed a defect. He vehemently rebukes the Chinese scholars, who from the Han Dynasty onwards have dreamed of nothing but becoming officials. Wanting to be an official is naturally not a bad thing, but the intentions of this group of scholars who want to become officials are somewhat special. "Upon careful examination, what they want is the authority of the official, the dignity of the official, the prosperity of the official. Becoming an official can be fulfilling, can be comfortable, can be indulgent, can be for personal gain. Thinking of the official for one's own convenience, thinking of the official for one's own happiness. It is not to study politics and use the responsibility of politics that they want to become an official. Inside the official, there is also something particularly bad, which is getting rich. Once rich, one can have abundant food and clothing, and can have proud wives and beautiful concubines, and even have wealth that continues for generations. Where there is profit, people tend to flock to it. Therefore, the two words 'getting rich' have increased the heat of their desire to become officials by hundreds of times. When their psychological function reaches this level, naturally there is no talk of the responsibility of the official. How politics is studied, he does not ask. How politics is used, he does not care. He simply believes that reading is a tool for seeking office, and being an official is the reward for reading. Reading to seek office, and obtaining office because of reading. Reading is the cause of becoming an official, and becoming an official is the result of reading. Reading until one becomes an official is considered a good cause and a good result, and one can face the heavens and tell people, and there is no slightest regret or subtle defect.</p>
<p>Then, the author discusses the defect in the responsibility of Chinese officials. Based on historical facts, his conclusion is that "officials before the Duke of Zhou were responsible. Officials in the era of the Warring States were incompetent to take responsibility and had to rely on their personal identity. Officials in the Western Han Dynasty were focused on negative responsibility, discarding positive responsibility. Officials after the end of the Han Dynasty not only discarded positive responsibility, but also discarded negative responsibility completely. Not only negative responsibility, but also their personal identity was sacrificed, willingly acting as a tool of the emperor. If a person reaches the point of disregarding their identity, naturally they will go downhill day by day, and there is nothing brilliant to say. Therefore, the officials after the Jin Dynasty simply wanted the vanity of being an official and the actual benefits of money. Not to mention that the identity of the officials became unspeakably bad, but also the ability and knowledge of the officials themselves decreased day by day. By the late Song and Ming Dynasties, the government offices of those officials had almost become a home for the disabled. If everyone doesn't believe it, please look at how they treated the Jin, Yuan, and Qing invasions, and you will understand. Naturally, they could not but explore the secret to seeking office, could not but study the method of being an official, and even more could not but search for the way to make money. So it came to the point that all the high officials (could not govern the country in peacetime and could not respond to changes in times of chaos. We look at the Song Dynasty, which was uncertain about peace and war and full of debate, and the Ming Dynasty, which was noisy when things were urgent and noisy when things were slow, and we can know their tricks. Local officials were less intelligent than merchants and less knowledgeable than clerks. We look at those who do not distinguish between the plaintiff and the defendant in the courtroom and do not distinguish between wheat and rice in the fields, and we can also prove their knowledge.) Regarding the welfare of the people, they did not care at all, and simply became an obligation to pay money and a right to ask for money. How much less did they care about the cultivation of national character?</p>
<p>Secondly, the author talks about the defect in the responsibility of Chinese soldiers. In the Chinese social psychology of "good iron is not used to make nails, and good people do not become soldiers," the recruits are naturally not good elements. They are all poor and lazy hooligans. Forced by life, they have to take risks. So, they all gather under a recruiting banner without prior consultation. "So it came to the point that the organization of the army completely became a collection of poor people, lazy people, and violent people. Once they are about to set out for battle, they are also inexplicable as to why. They only hear the superiors issuing an order, calling them to start walking. Then they have no choice but to carry their guns and drag their legs to the front line. When they are hit by bullets and die, they also do not know why they sacrificed. However, they have never seen them being as brave for national wars as they are for private fights. They simply do not know the meaning of being a soldier or the responsibility of being a soldier."</p>
<p>China's diseases are really too many, and the degree of the diseases is deep enough. To summarize in one sentence, it can be said that it is all caused by the affliction of wealth and prosperity. The third part of this book exposes all aspects of China's diseases very thoroughly, truthfully stating the location of the symptoms of the disease. Looking at the historical facts of the past dynasties, it was either established to protect wealth and prosperity or there was strife to seek wealth and prosperity. In the past two thousand years, the changes in the political situation have been sometimes tense and sometimes lax, sometimes moving and sometimes still, none of which did not have wealth and prosperity as the center. "Therefore, no matter what the occasion, there is always a competition for private interests and no achievement of public interest. There is much discussion and little action. There is much seeing and little effort, taking private as private, taking public as private, transforming public into private, and benefiting private interests under the guise of public service. Private methods are everywhere, and everyone can do them." So, it has completely become a social disease.</p>
<p>This is known to everyone, and naturally we cannot allow this terrible social disease to spread. Regarding this point, the author has determined the treatment method and its order. He feels that the defect of the soldiers is like cholera. We must first find a way to prevent this cholera disease, and then come back to talk about the wealth and prosperity disease that has spread for two thousand years. In short, his treatment method is to use preventive measures in the areas of agriculture, industry, and commerce to prevent the disease demon from invading. In the area of scholars, he uses a containment method to cut off the wings of the disease demon. In the area of seeking office, he uses a blocking and suppressing method to cut off the way out for the disease demon. In the area of being an official, he uses a combination of suppression and appeasement methods to eliminate the power of the disease demon and sever the lifeblood of the disease demon. As for the detailed implementation methods, I can only ask the reader to refer to the original book.</p>
<p>In the fourth part, the author tells us about the vitality and new life of China's future. After the Northern Expedition was completed, the period of political tutelage has already begun. Regarding political reform, at least there are some in fact. There is no need to be greedy for more, and there is no need to be far-sighted. We should measure our strength and demand results. If there are no results, then punish. Chinese people are lazy. If the local officials in the future are willing to teach everyone to do it and prevent everyone from not doing it, and if Chinese officials have the bad habit of "wanting money and not doing things," if there is a supervisory court to give those officials some fear, then naturally China's new vitality is hopeful. We should extend our own feelings to others, and after revitalizing our own national character, we can naturally follow Mr. Sun Yat-sen's nationalism and seek the welfare and equality of all nations in the world. Knowing is difficult and doing is easy. I'm just afraid that we haven't completely understood it. If we all clearly recognize our own national character and are willing to work hard, our future is bright and great. At that time, the white sun will be in the sky, and all things will be nurtured, like that cold night moon that serves as a supplement for us.</p>
<p>Unable to escape the common general format, the last part is also, as usual, the conclusion. In the conclusion, he also describes the current situation of external pressure and the location of internal weaknesses, and says that "external pressure is actually caused by internal weaknesses, and internal weaknesses are actually cast by internal diseases." Therefore, if we want the Chinese nation to be healthy, we should work hard to remove the diseases of laziness and cynicism. We should also correct our wrong consciousness and enrich our inherent beautiful national character.</p>
<p>It is not that I intentionally nitpick. I really feel that there are some imperfections. Regarding the aspects of China's diseases, what the author has reported are all about the literate class. As for the will of the common people, who make up the majority of the Chinese nation, there is no exposure of some defects, which seems to be not without shortcomings. I am not trying to shift the sins of the officials and scholars onto the majority of the common people. The sins of the officials and scholars are a fact. At the same time, the ignorance of the common people, which leads to the decline of the entire nation, also seems to be a defect. This is also a fact. I feel that the majority of the common people are indeed pitiful. They do not know that there is such a thing as "nation," and therefore do not know that they are Chinese, and naturally do not recognize their own national consciousness. Being subjected to double oppression and exploitation, they are still willing to suffer a little loss and seek to turn trouble into nothing. How can we ignore this great phenomenon of social pathology without seeking remedies?</p>
<p>There are countries in the world that have perished because of laziness. If we continue to be lazy, I am afraid that we will follow in their footsteps. In this autumn of crisis, can the Chinese nation still not take on the responsibility for the nation? How should we eliminate national pathogens, awaken national consciousness, and consolidate the strength of the Chinese nation?</p>
<h3 id="e215">News of the Sisters by Tang Zengyang <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>By Xu Helin</p>
<p>Modern young people are all infected with a so-called disease of the century, constantly experiencing the stimulation of misfortune, and thus becoming decadent. As a result, they seek unexpected comfort in the literary and artistic realm that can reconcile their dry lives. This is the so-called only way to seek comfort in life. Moreover, the cries evoked from one's own passionate heart feel particularly real and interesting, and can be regarded as a memento left over from the life process. This alone makes it not meaningless for a young literary artist to vent his own creative desires. Mr. Xu Helin wrote "News of the Sisters" and left it for the world to see for this reason.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Xu's moans from his heart can easily arouse the sympathy of our readers, as if the author has faithfully written down in words the unfortunate experiences that we want to express, nakedly and completely. The minds that have been frequently struck by the same golden arrow also gain a trace of (the comfort and joy that ordinary humans and the ordinary universe cannot give me). This is because the author's narrative is true and not false.</p>
<p>A small collection that encompasses content that can resonate with readers and at the same time provide a kind of unobtainable comfort is truly rare and valuable. However, the author of this book has actually managed to do this, so I believe that there must be many people who (share feelings) with the author, then it is necessary to inquire about this "News of the Sisters".</p>
<p>The entire book is only one hundred and six pages long and includes seven short stories: 1. News of the Sisters, 2. The Pitiful Evening Party, 3. Comedy on West Lake, 4. New Awakening, 5. Small Stain, 6. Donkey's Whining, 7. Good Encounter. These contain both the news and stories of women, so naming it "News of the Sisters" is very appropriate. Essays such as "The Pitiful Evening Party" depict "the victory of women" with great insight, expressing the true meaning of love with artistic skill, allowing us to taste (the taste of love) while reading.</p>
<p>The author's depiction of the female psychology is particularly skillful, sometimes tense, sometimes relaxed, sometimes delicate, sometimes crude, as if he had dug the woman's heart out of her chest and placed it before the public's eyes, making it clearer than anything else.</p>
<p>The intelligent Yingying immediately understood that this was his extravagant wish and secret thoughts for her future. Although she was very willing to agree to this truly moving request, at this moment, in order to maintain the dignity of the spirit when people first meet, it was necessary to deliberately say a few evasive words to avoid the direct attack of this emotion. She pretended not to have heard clearly and hurriedly replied, "We have traveled together three or four times before, yes.</p>
<p>But in the past, many people came together." (Page 44)</p>
<p>After reading this short paragraph in "Comedy on West Lake", we can understand that the author's portrayal of women's psychology and attitude is very vivid, as if we have seen the entire woman's heart. Such powerful depiction is indeed worthy of envy, and it is rare in many creative books. At the same time, perhaps the author also has a considerable study of women's issues, otherwise, his writing about women would not be so flexible and vivid no matter what.</p>
<p>(No, no, I swear to my conscience, I love you and I love the children, but I can't help but love myself. This is my new awakening since last night.)</p>
<p>(Of course, it is an awakening for me, of course it is a very new awakening. If I never had this awakening, my life would eventually be shattered under the burden of a good mother and a virtuous wife, and no one would care...) (Page 62) In the above two very simple dialogues, the family problems between the two sexes and the so-called (good mother and virtuous wife) concept left over from the old society can be clearly seen. This is also evidence that the author has a considerable study of women's issues. In the essay "New Awakening", he also nakedly exposed the male's contempt and bullying of women, as well as the sinister intentions hidden in their hearts.</p>
<p>(...All my youth, all my youthful energy, all my youthful appearance, all my youthful hopes, all my youthful poetic inspiration have been ruined, buried, and sacrificed by you, but you often look at me with sharp eyes, looking at the children, looking at the family, looking at life and society, and often take a proud attitude towards me, towards the children, towards the family, towards life and society. Alas, your thoughts are rotting little by little, and you don't even know that the inferior roots of suppressing women, which have been passed down from your ancestors and hidden in the inheritance of your jade body, are erupting little by little. You don't feel it at all. You, you are so pitiful, so ridiculous, so lamentable!) (Page 63)</p>
<p>What meaningful words these are, actually uttered from the mouth of a woman. It is really not easy, and it can be seen that the woman's entire resolute personality is gradually grasping new consciousness and embarking on the road to awakening. Moreover, the author, Mr. Xu, has also grasped some of the national consciousness, but he starts from the family, and this component is very small.</p>
<p>This is really because our families before today are unreasonable, unorganized, and sick, and are doomed to failure. If we insist on maintaining and perfunctorily continuing such a family that you and I both feel dissatisfied with, isn't it very dangerous? Isn't it more painful? We are not a French-style (out of sight, out of mind) nation. In fact, the sweetness of our love will become more intense because of (out of sight)...</p>
<p>It is inevitable that the author has this kind of consciousness, because he powerfully expresses the personality of Chinese women, which can also be regarded as promoting the spirit of the nation, especially the description of various phenomena in Chinese new and old families. However, this is not yet an aggressive and active one, it can only represent that he has grasped some superficial national consciousness.</p>
<p>The essay "News of the Sisters" is a story woven from ten letters, but when read consecutively, it also has considerable significance, unlike the usual popular and simple love stories that are so boring. It is really because the creation of stories that powerfully depict the female psychology and various events that occur between families is too rare. This is the only point that makes this book worthy of introduction.</p>

<p>European Federation</p>
<p>(1) At the 59th session of the Executive Council of the League of Nations, X in the picture is the chairman, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Linkowiecki, to the left is French Foreign Minister Briand, Italian Foreign Minister Grandi, and German Foreign Minister Curtius, to the right is Secretary-General Drummond, British Foreign Minister Henderson, and Japanese Ambassador to Belgium Nagai Matsuzo, all of whom are permanent members, and the rest are non-permanent members. Due to China's continued weakness, it has repeatedly failed to be elected. If issues related to China are discussed, a special seat will be set up to temporarily invite Chinese representatives to participate. 〇 in the picture is a reporter. The most important event discussed at this meeting was the issue of organizing the European Federation. Regarding our country, it is the issue of cooperation between China and the health organization of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(2) The picture shows French Foreign Minister Briand, who initiated the organization of the European Federation on the left, and French Prime Minister Tardieu on the right. On September 9th last year, Briand took the opportunity of the League of Nations annual conference to invite representatives of European countries to a luncheon to explain the importance of initiating the organization of the European Federation. At that time, everyone expressed sympathy. The French government conducted further concrete research. On May 17th this year, the French government took advantage of the day when the International Payment Bank officially took over the management of Germany's secret debt and sent out a memorandum on organizing the European Federation. Its superficial reason is that in order to seek European peace, economic cooperation must be carried out. In fact, it arose from the economic pressure exerted by the United States after the European War. As the name suggests, it is known that Europe and the United States are obviously opposed to each other.</p>
<p>(3) The new League of Nations building in Geneva, Sweden is currently under construction. The picture shows the plan designed by architectural experts.</p>
<p>(4) New York City as seen from the U.S. Navy airship, from 40th Street to 57th Street, with the Times Square and Paramount Building as the center, is the area with the tallest buildings and the most prosperous commerce. After the European War, the United States jumped from a debtor nation to a creditor nation, and the world's financial center shifted from London to New York. Therefore, today's New York City is the headquarters of the United States' economic invasion of the world.</p>
<p>(5) Gold is expensive and silver is cheap, and prices are soaring and commerce is stagnant. Our country is a country that uses silver, and it is manipulated by foreigners, and the world's finances are now in the hands of Americans. The fundamental plan should be to change to the gold standard. This is the tense situation in front of the Shanghai Gold Exchange. The government has already restricted the buying and selling of gold speculation.</p>
<p>(6) July 4th is the 154th anniversary of the United States' declaration of independence. On the morning of that day, hundreds of American expatriates in Shanghai brought their children to gather at the U.S. Consul General's Office to participate in the flag-raising ceremony. The picture shows Consul General Cunningham giving a brief speech on the situation in the country.</p>
<p>(7) The protocol of the Sino-Polish Commercial Treaty was formally signed by Wang Zhengting and Polish Plenipotentiary Weydenthal at the Capital Diplomatic Residence at 4:30 pm on July 1st. After the protocol is sent to the Polish government and a telegram is received, it can be announced simultaneously by both parties.
