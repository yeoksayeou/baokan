<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本所謂國防缺陷</h3>
<p>日本因倫敦海約問題引起國防缺陷之爭論所謂國防缺陷者不過專家計畫之言即使如專家之言軍備而不縮減苟有戰事亦豈能必勝而不敗乎故余謂國防缺陷說之起原大抵爲國家財政與軍費之務盾而已國家之財政不足以敷軍備之需在國家財政方面言不得不减削在國家軍備言面言減削之後對於平時之布置不敷應付於是矛盾以生而國防缺陷之說遂起苟或不然日本未有今日之軍備以前日本國家且未曾受人侵略豈已有今日之軍備而國防反有懼人侵略之缺陷乎此必無之事也</p>
<p>我於倫敦縮減軍備開會時曾言之各國之所以提倡縮減軍備者非眞有弭戰之心也因爲各國之競爭擴張軍備對於財政將無力以繼其後也因爲財政之不足乃有軍備之縮減若各國之財政日益增加如歐洲大戰以前者我恐各國擴張之不暇而斷不肯縮減也縮減軍備之義本爲各國各使其國防缺陷而不致發現戰事也今若旣欲軍備縮減而又欲國防一無缺陷天下安有此不矛盾而兩全之事乎日本國中今有國防缺陷之爭於以知日本之對於軍備縮減之非由誠意</p>

<h3>台維斯杯第二日决賽法國又勝雙打組</h3>
<p>法柯顯脫白羅尼勝（美）愛力生文賴因三比一一法總統到場參觀一一法國有重重握霸權之趨勢一</p>
<p>（二十六日巴黎電訉）台維斯杯却令治賽今日美法舉行雙扜比賽自昨美法各勝單打一組以後　球之網球嗜好者羣集目於今（廿六）日之結果蓋其勝負有關美法掌握霸權之趨勢也</p>
<h3>錦標之預測</h3>
<p>是日亞蒂歐球塲之座位全爲觀衆所占滿法總統陶墨格親臨戰塲激勵士氣大戰結果法柯顯脫與白羅尼以三比一戰勝美愛力生與文賴因三日统計法以二對一占前最後之單打二幕乃法柯顯脫對美鐵爾登及法波羅脫拉對美喬治洛德預測戰績美欲奪標須連勝二組然實際上恐均非法之對手充其量或至各勝一組則法國之重握覇權在目下論似非難事</p>
<h3>雙打之經過</h3>
<p>法人柯顯脫之技能絶無錯誤可謂其生平得意之作也處位之當精力之富嘆爲觀止其同伴白羅尼又助以美妙之底線球重重壓迫美隊遂奄然無生氣第一第二兩盤法以六比三七比五連勝第三盤美隊有特殊之表演四周觀衆爲之稱許不已果然以六比一奪回一盤第四盤法火東山再起活躍非凡又回恢其銳氣作最後I</p>
<h3>雙打獲勝之法國選手（右）柯顯德（左）白羅尼</h3>
<p>I</p>
<p>I</p>
<h3>雙打失敗之美國選手（右）愛立生（左）文賴因</h3>
<p>I</p>
<p>之加鞭不久以六比二勝美</p>
<h3>勝敗之原因</h3>
<p>法之勝球藝固佳而經騐尤富二人配對如左右手進退有方攻守相連美隊二人乃新進好手膂力健壯善於久戰惟以氣血方剛之士多犯意志慌亂之病美隊亦不能免之遂多自殺之舉然最大之錯誤美隊二人均集中於穩健之柯顯脫方面而對於法隊弱點之一人白羅尼反置之腦後作戰計劃全誤其覆敗也實自取之罪</p>
<h3>惠勃登回顧</h3>
<p>回顧一月前之惠勃登大戰頗覺大有興趣當時美愛力生嘗戰勝法柯顯脫而法勃羅脫拉則擊敗喬治洛德今番勃羅脫拉與喬治洛德再遇於台維斯杯未知法人能保持其勝利否抑或被美人轉反局面乎又其時柯顯脫與白羅尼合組被美人陶愛格與洛德於複賽幕中擊敗然最後决賽美人愛力生與文賴因以六比三六比三六比二敗陶愛格與洛德獲將該項錦標此次台維斯决賽中柯顯脫與白羅尼在二重失敗者之地位而能獲勝者確予我人值得之回顧也</p>
<h3>八月一日開幕之</h3>
<p>第四屆世界學生運動會　　一參加者共念九國一男女選手千餘人一</p>
<p>第四屆世界學生運動大會已定於八月一日起在德國達姆斯達晚城舉行競賽會期自八月一日至十日計十日報名參加者共念九國爲全歐各國及美國加拿大新西蘭日本南菲洲等一切規程比賽項目悉依世界運動會爲田徑游泳划船擊劍足球網球等等</p>
<h3>各國田徑選手</h3>
<p>報名選手共一千餘人以田徑選手爲最多計二百四十四人約佔五分之一德國最多五十人法國三十人次之意大利二十五人日本十五人列第四美國選手最惹注意蓋人數頗少然各個實力及成績俱勝人一籌</p>
<h3>日本此次可惜</h3>
<p>日本此次選手雖只十五人然在大會中必佔一地位無疑遠東運動會後其所創成績震驚世界爲織田幹雄均爲世界運動會選手共他各國亦頗多世界選手故此次大會成績之打破世界紀錄非不可能日本最惜者爲應慶大學選手之拒絶被派赴歐其故即爲遠東會前應慶之被處罰否則實力更將雄厚應慶高田之鐵球津田之千五百米成績俱接近世界紀錄富有奪標希望者</p>
<h3>田徑項目略異</h3>
<p>比賽項目悉照世界運動會惟田徑賽中議决將一萬米及一千米　　跑一級跳遠三項取消女生部則將多數人懷疑之八百米長距離跑取消而代以八十米障礙跑另加跑跳遠及標槍</p>
<h3>足球八國比賽</h3>
<p>加入足球者共八國爲德法匃羅馬尼亞捷克意盧森堡及南斯拉夫等八國其中以匃意二隊最强預測决賽將屬諸該二隊也橄欖球加入者祗德法二國羅馬尼亞未定此項將僅作表演賽云我國足球隊惜時間不及否則大可前往一賽也</p>

<h3>講壇警語華華女士</h3>
<p>楊杏佛氏日前應滬巿敎局暑校講演題爲中國三十年新敎育失敗之因果由主席周君尙介紹畢楊氏即登壇講演辭多警語足資愓勵兹摘其要者以廣傳聞</p>
<p>中國祇有腐化力楊氏引馬湘伯大同大學演辭謂梁任公著文表楊國人富同化力能同化外族國人咸以此怡然自得實則吾人無同化力可言所具者惟腐化力耳不見夫西南邊地被黄帝所逐走之苗猺猶存四千年來何不同化外人到華威震中土吾國每贈子女玉帛使彼淫逸腐化樂不思蜀天下安寗獲無事此風至今尙熾但外人洞悉原因今則不中吾計另闢租界獨成區域自帶妻女不受腐化無怪吾國被人蹂躪益劇無力禦侮也</p>
<p>寗願三年無敎育滿清倒民國興坊間出版之敎科書換一簿面由大清帝國而爲共和國敎科書内容多換湯不換藥最近國民政府成立一般敎科書又易一簿面敎材稍加删改居然三民敎科書出現矣如此敷衍革命安能成功吾意寗願全國三年無敎育各校敎科書悉行焚毁片瓦不留根據三民主義及吾人之總生活重行編訂編輯者須受相當之訓練務使主義實際化</p>
<p>三民主義自地生曩昔敎育宗旨之失敗以其紙上談兵不合生活今之三民主義敎育不幸又將蹈覆轍仍不脫文章與講演主義麻木已久學校施行黨化敎育爲時三年試問今之畢業生較往日有何逈異三民主義四字行將與阿彌陀佛化基督化同爲街談巷議之口頭禪口是而心非其故皆因衆視主義自天下降殊不知三民主義實爲種子須種入土地由地生長始獲根芽發榮滋長自易奉勸諸敎師速將主義種入童心俾早實現則國人將九頓首感謝諸公矣</p>

<p>現大多數的國家都是以帝國主義的手叚施諸中國其中尤其使人們夙夜不能忘記的就是那僅隔一衣帶水的所謂「蝎子勢」的（日本）了日本無論在政治的地理的文化的在時間上無論過去現在與未來和中國都是有最深切重要的關係的日本自明治維新以來朝野上下更秉傳統的一貫的侵略政策南進也好北進也好都是以中國爲進取的目標「斗瓢傾盡醉飮夢踏破支那四百州」是何等可怕的這種寤寐不忘的野心什麽不值得我們去注意呵</p>
<p>中國是號稱地大物博有很多的事事物物連自己還没有仔細覺察的而外人丨尤其日本一的學術偵察隊却全盤偵察去了「我們試跑到東京的書店去看他們所著關於中國問題的書藉眞不知多少哲學文學政治經濟社會地理歷史等等分門别類精微俱至每月雜誌所登研究中國問題的文章至少也有幾百篇目每年統冶機關與社會團體所派遣中國常川調查或是旅行視察的又不止幾千百人所支出的調查研究費年至五六百萬元以上偵查所得編成書皇皇數十巨册的何至十數部即如「支那經濟全書」「支那省别全誌」篇幅之多搜羅之備尤足使我們驚走駭汗這樣他們以之應用於經濟的競爭軍事的攻略那有不得心應手的道理過去曾有過數次熱烈的反日運動國内青年奔走號呼而能夠研究對象了解對象有正確策略來領導羣衆的是没有則失敗自然是意中事日本研究　便是適應我們目前的需要抱着「我們要憑歷史的眼光科學的判力把日本的政治經濟敎育風俗宗敎文學哲學與及社會種種的實地現象及其構成的原因一一去分解出來歸納起來而成爲一種鐵案不易的定論的使命來介紹日本的一切實在的」我們要反抗日本的經濟侵略怎可不了解他們的組織及變動我們要反對日本的軍國思想怎可不了解他們的政治傳統與造因在政治的立場上我們不洞察敵情便無以克敵致勝在研究學術的立塲上我們没有精確的審覈便無以證實其學理」所以定得「無論站在政治的立場站在研究學術的立塲都應該把日本的國家社會文物一切一切的東西還他一個究竟是什麽和爲什麽清清楚楚解剖出來貢獻於全國人士之前」（發刋詞）　　實際日本之造成現代的新勢力一方面是中國印度高麗輸入各種精神的文明能通同醇化起來適應自己的生活造出民族特性植立國家的基礎一方面也是能接受西方的科學文明其次民族意識和民族自信力的堅强也更構成了民族的生氣勃勃不斷向上的發展所以時至今日以中國的現勢對日本的研究實不容淡漠爲什麽日本是不斷向上中國却反而淪落那末又該怎様急起直追</p>
<p>因之「日本」雜誌的發現是很可喜的也可說是替我們荒凉的雜誌界爭爭氣這是第一期創刋號内容很豐富而且都是根據於實地的考察而蒐集來的顯明地暴露日本的眞相和内容這裏約略說一說</p>
<p>在劉百閔君的「日本第二次普選總選舉之經過及其結果」我們約略可以了解日本政局的傳統與造因各黨雖爭持異常劇烈而對外的一貫政策依然如故甚至在這次總選舉外交統置諸問題之外證明他們軍國思想之深蒂政友田中獰惡之面目雖摘去而民政濱口又何異瞿荆洲君的「日本金輸出之禁止及其解禁」日揭發日本的經濟狀况金解禁之前因後果在日本施行金解禁之後的影響顯然在「國際貿易」正貨與通貨」「不景象」和「物價」都很惡劣所謂「經濟國難」「思想國難」金解禁之後更進一層的形式深刻化了馬宗榮君的「日本無産敎育者爲藤五郎氏的日本敎育論「這裏祗載及前編「日本敎育的現實」說明劃一主義的敎育和敎育特權化敎育特權化是先學校敎育特權化其次又官僚學校特權化而富與資本的特權化又伸張魔手與上二種特權互相勾結狼狽爲奸壟斷一切是給中國敎育界的一個旁擊王益滔君的「日本米穀法之研究」是以愓醒中國食糧政策毫無統制之錯誤蓋自歐戰以還各國受戰爭之敎訓無不亟亟於糧食政策多數國家都在謀振興農業以固國本平均穀價以利農民日本也是以農立國的雖然日本現行的米穀法未有臻於完善之境而顧我國内情形尙何足以言並論况最近米價騰貴民生愈形凋敝則中國之務宜澈底研究通盤籌劃斟酌國内情形採擇各國設施而定國家百年之大計實已其時諒欽君的「日本陸軍之近狀」爲中國今日禦强暴謀生存圖平等自非研究不可中日之戰後日本便視中國爲其俎上之肉日俄之戰獲勝更氣熖萬丈逼逼凌人歐洲時乘列强無暇東顧大肆侵略復盡量擴充軍備爭覇的野心在在溢於言表其陸軍制度大半採取德制仿而行之精神形式極蔚爲大觀頗爲列强所稱許本篇僅及「軍令與軍政機關之區别」「陸軍部」入「訓練總監部」之組織係未完龐民君的「未來戰爭與日本及東三省之關係」是值得我們注意的誰都知道在現代戰爭中軍需品的充實是該最先解决的一個問題但要使自然形變爲實用形必須熱或電力此燃燒原料效力最大者當首推石炭其次工業上之必要者爲鐵礦復次爲石油日本旣野心不死但自顧自身各種原料之缺乏是事實不得不亟亟於調查準備於是中國的東三省首蒙其光顧了東三省自然産物之富饒雖不能解决日本經濟上生活上國防上的全部亦可得其大半在食糧上有穀類蓄類及支持日本農業的豆餅鐵礦甚多石炭亦不少且依化學之方法可以補石油之不足又化學工業主要原料之鹽鎂礦Magnesite及Dolomite亦出産甚多這樣看來日本之欲得東三省怎不打下如意算盤作者更將各項出産量比較的圖表分别刋出尤爲驚心奪目讀者讀之眞不知將作何感想周一和君的「日本婦女的社會運動」關於日本婦女運動的發生進展的過程及運動的將來解剖得很清楚足供中國努力婦女運動者的參考日本婦女在社會上地位之低卑生活的奴隷性雖經了明治維新而婦女還是不得她們所應享的權利這是使我們大惑不解的看了吳自强君的「日本的師範敎育」再回顧中國的師範敎育其中的差别如何敎育的力量足以促個人的向上而師範敎育便是佔敎育制度的中心這無論在那一個國家都是如此的吧其次劉家壎君的「日本國旗的研究」忻介六君的「近代日本人底人種學的考察」「日本人的自殺」「日本人結婚的迷信」袁素一君的「日向新村通信」讀了更覺得有些津津之味而也值得我們去研究檢討的</p>
<p>拉雜的介紹了總之我們如要反抗帝國主義自然得研究帝國主義使大家認識帝國主義的鬼把戲而在這些帝國</p>

<h3>中國民間文學槪說增敡</h3>
<p>楊蔭深著華通書局出版</p>
<p>民間文學是文學中唯一的寳藏在中國去發掘這寳藏的人確乎很少雖然前幾年也有人注意到它但「時不經久到現在又像雲散烟消了」這有如一個忠厚的老實人目擊着這無量數的金與蜜而置之不顧不過這「金」是拌着黄色的沙泥而「蜜」更其是未經過人工的製造尙不能充作食料中國人具有不良的賴惰性好似已成了根深蒂固的了所以明顯地知道這些「金」與「蜜」是人間最大的寳藏但是要經過許多時間與精神去發掘這寳藏却不是我們中國人固性的所願這實是使民間文學不能深入於知識份子的腦底唯一的缺陷如果要補足這缺陷祗有賴諸現代一般愛好文藝的青年急切地起來提倡「民間文藝」的研求</p>
<p>原來民間文藝才深切的含有「民族意識」雖然其中脫不掉封建的宗敎的出世的以個人爲中心的思想但它所播下「民族意識」的種子在我們是無論如何不能否認的詩經是當時民間文學的合集到了現在還有人的歌誦是所成爲一部永久不朽的巨作也是因爲它屬於民間文學所以直到現在還依舊流傳很可惜是中國的一般文人向來對於民間文學不深加注意現今還是這様有的雖然知道民間文學的可貴但憚煩收集的種族手續又把它輕輕地忽視過去有的守舊者不但很少利用它而且甚至於鄙視它的因此還有多量的和至寳一様價值的民間文學尙留存於民衆的口頭上與及記憶裏</p>
<p>這實是一椿值得嘆惜的事甚且連一本有系統的討論民間文學的書在中國也不能夠多見關於研究此項文學的那更其是「鳳毛麟角」的了我們要曉得原來民間文學是具有「廣泛性」與「永久性」的無論怎樣對於它應有相當的愛護因爲在某一個所屬的國家關於含有自己所屬國的「民族意識」的文學作品當然不應該對它有所忽視况且這民間文學有的是表現着所屬國的民族性凡此種種在所流傳的歌謡傳說神話時調之中都可以隨時隨地的發現在它眞情流露的行間很容易尋找着的這可見民間文學在文學上的價值了</p>
<p>楊蔭深君這部「中國民間文學槪說」一書却是一部關於研究民間文學稍有系統的書尤其在一般文人素來對民間文學忽視的中國像這樣的書所出版是非常的重要然而在書的本身的優劣實是另一個問題我相信楊君的這部「槪說」至少可以作研究民間文學的人一種參考與及對於喚醒向來忽視此項文學的人更其是無疑的了</p>
<p>全書除掉前逢兩段「引言」與「結論」之外其重要的論述尙分六章第一章「民間文學是甚麽」第二章「民間文學與文學」第三章「民間文學的由來」第四章「民間文學的價值」第五章「民間文學的分類」第六章「民間文學的作品」是用四號字排印的大槪是爲了讀者易於瞭目的原故</p>
<p>第一章「民間文學是甚麽」裏作者是取最簡練的筆法叙述明白甚麽呌做民間文學怎様值得我們去欣賞去研究的這些雖然在本書「引言」已有所論及但在此作者更其將它作一種淺顯的解釋使讀者能夠明瞭民間文學到底是一件什麽東西在全書中這是屬於最簡短的一章但使我們讀了能夠得到很深的印象明白古代傳流下來的如歌謡·謎語·時調·笑話傳記·神話·····等等都是所謂「民間文學」而且這民間文學亦即是合攏這許多文學的文學是屬於口述的耳聽的是一般民衆演述口傳的這裏所述的民間文學實在值得我們的注意並且作者引用美國亨德（TbdeoolowHunt）的話來說明文學應具的條件民間文學也是一樣他說「文學是思想的文學底表現通過了想像感情及趣味而在於使一般人們對之容易理解並且在惹起興味的那様非專門底形式中的」因此民間文學旣然是一般人都能理解文字又不是「專門的」它能惹起人們去欣賞興味這便是必然的事實况且還有「自然的音律精密的結構」思想想像感情等等甚至傳遞至幾千幾百年而不滅這實是最好的佐證所以民間文學是一種眞正的文學</p>

<h3>世界文學的故事（一八三）美國約翰瑪西著胡仲持譯</h3>
<p>第四十七章亞美利加的小說</p>
<p>新近纔死的那些作家之中最可記憶者是和十九世紀一同終結了短促的生涯的那時代最有才能的亞美利加作家史梯芬卡倫他的南北戰爭的故事「勇氣的赤徽章」或許因那以後更可怕的戰爭而多少晦暗了也未可知然而故事的技巧却不能褪色還有一個年青而死的有才能的人就是眞正的寫實主義者佛朗克揵利斯他顯示了處理大的主題的發皇的力他的偉大的主材是眞實的叙事詩現存的小說家之中最優秀的藝術家是伊狄司霍吞她所描寫的塲景是紐約或富裕的紐約人消夏的别莊地她是非常聰明有些紈絝氣但根本底地富于同情的貴族在伊散夫羅謨」及「夏」之中她用了同最優的尉爾琴兹福禮門夫人的作品一樣確實的力叙述紐英格蘭的鄕間的悲劇現代亞美利加的故事作家有許多似乎是被那具有眞實的才能和優美的諧謔的人物○亨利的妖術所蒙住似的他是富于創意和發明心在太過雜誌主義底文體這一點有缺陷的天生的故事家要領略那聰明的人物的缺陷讀者只消回返到略略以前的○亨利即HC彭那去一見優美的文體能夠以磨鍊的完全的文體傳達出來這事情就可以和文學底藝術相結合的人間底内容是永久有生命的小說的要素我在亞美利加小說之中是見到人間底内容的成長和優秀的技術的豐富的實例的然而更美的文體的意識雖然决不缺乏却没有如在今日别的諸國那様熱心地被開發進于那個方向的改善終究不過是時間問題而已</p>
<p>第四十八章亞美利加的論文和歷史</p>
<p>亞美利加對於牠的孩子們的知識和空想開始有自己的主張了丨愛默生十九世紀中亞美利加的智底中心是波士頓及近隣都巿岡布里治及康科特可是紐英格蘭没有單獨地支配了亞美利加思想界在紐約及菲列得爾菲亞也有着活潑的文學底活動歐文及庫拍是紐約州之子那從神的國土來似的挨餓的天才坡是當他的最生産底的而且比較底榮盛的很少的諸年住於紐約而從那堡砦向紐英格蘭的覇權施了峻烈的攻擊的然而那覇權雖非没有減色的様子却同在意大利的佛羅稜薩的覇權一様是確定的事實波士頓在缺乏諧謔味的稱護或是譏嘲中是常被稱爲亞美利加的雅典的</p>
<p>放光於亞美利加全部至今還没有失却那穩和的光輝的思想從住於小小的鄕下風的文明之中的一小羣思想家而來這是確實的對於那種文明現今有着估價估得低的傾向而那個確乎有着許</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>多的弱點那種文明的詩在内容的獨創性和形式的支配　閘者都有所缺乏是力弱的東西散文上的眞實的藝術家不過是霍桑及和謨兹這兩人可記憶的少數個人的制限是明明白白而且被製爲紙片目錄聲叙以理由了可是紐英格蘭的作家的羣作爲全體看來是表現了</p>
<p>創造了一個純粹的文化的那文化波及到紐英格蘭以外而在極不等質的甚至有敵對底的地方氣質的國中國民性這東西可能的範圍成爲國民底了</p>
<p>那時代的主導底思想家是歷代相承的清敎說敎師家之子對於那祖先的峻嚴和他們的德性的洗鍊了的純化自由主義的逆兒愛獻生他所宣說而示以模範的德性是單純的丨自恃心並非眛於生之粗糙的事實的樂天主義澄靜的心境温雅對於人對於宿在人的心胸並不在形式底宗敎的神的信仰等等</p>
<p>愛默生的論文及演說是說敎他雖然退出尤尼泰利安敎會而在他的生涯的大部分並非什麽信仰什麽宗派的信奉者却一生是說敎師以調子和内容而言他的說敎遠過於單調的說敎壇的嚷嚷那雄辯又自然又眞摯那智慧是由詩底說明比喻尖銳的諷剌底語句以及諧謔顯出生彩的愛默生的文章有數百句爲了那敏慧遒勁表現之緊凑的極致是值得引用的</p>
<p>他的思想所以敏銳模様豐富的一個理由是因爲他知道從别的作家之中怎様來選出和自己的目的相適合思想</p>
<p>使成爲自己的東西這緣故「次於寫優美的文章者」他云「是最初引用那文章的人」這就說明着他的才能的重要的部分可是他在第二義底意義上並非模倣底岐生底他是將凡他所觸的一切澈底地愛默生化了的捉住了他的同代人的音聲和人格的蠱惑力於我們是失却了然而他那印成的言辭中却還有聲音底說服力在請將他的「論文集」或「生的行爲」或「代表底人物」或「社會和孤獨」的任何一頁揭開來着罷你就會聽得一個人談着哩那種種的思想在例如「自然」呀「政治」呀「報復」呀這様廣汎的抽象底標題之下集合在一起然而思想本身是直截特殊鮮明的</p>
<p>愛厭生於體系和論理底議論並無什麽興味他的論文據說幾乎没有搆造底統一雖從後面也可以讀的那是從兩端都能數起的眞珠串然而眞珠是純粹的或者如愛默生往往如此迅速地來變化詞采罷那麽潛流着的愛默生本人的人格是對於散亂的思想給以統一的比起他來更深邃更有體系的哲學者是有的具有更美的文學底藝術的論文家也是有的他的詩雖有多少卓越的句子却剪去了翼不能飛翔於不朽的人們之問然而愛默生的偉大不能否定那偉大是他自身的他明示着他自己的話「美之最善者是在表面上在輪廓上較之熟練更美妙的蠱惑力要不然則藝術上的規則常能敎那從藝術的人類性格的作品放射出來的東西」云云而且他發着「當心偉大的神在這行星上放縱了思想家的時候呵」這句他的最幽玄的話時雖然他是太過謙遜模様譜謔底没有像我們所想似的用意在個人底適用却也是暗示着自己的</p>
<p>神似乎是在這個行星的一隅紐英格蘭解放了數個思想家了似的一個是愛默生的友人兼且鄰人莎羅他對於同代者没有怎様的影響但他的天才則當新的讀者看出他來愈益廣汛地被認識了他的主要的著作「窩爾登」是康科特附近的森林中過了兩年的他的生活的孤獨和自恃之實騐的記錄他將自已能夠從社會獨立而生活他和自然相互地共同滿足這呈證明了那書的蠱惑力是在莎羅從衷心享樂了自己所選取且有過度的自由的生活「每晨是使我的生活和自然本身相等地單純而且我可以說純潔這一種可喜的誘導」他所崇拜的自然確實是單純純潔的東西而他對於女神的氣分的觀察是直截原始底獨創底没有過分地發揮着本職的「博物學者」之專門底知識的</p>

<h3>黑人的小說楊昌溪</h3>
<p>在「黑人的詩歌」一文中已行把美國黑奴們在詩歌中表現的民族的自覺作了個簡略的檢討但是詩哥不過是一種尖銳的控訴僅是一種民族覺醒的警笛而實地能把黑奴們在美國白人統治的社會下所過的實生活眞眞的描寫出來的還要算小說所以在小說中我們看到的不是一個奴隸的呻吟而是他們全民族的奴隸生活的縮寫</p>
<p>美國的黑人雖然在物質上擺脫不了她的勢力但是在文化上在文學上他們却自有他們的民族精神因爲第一步尼格羅人已經在白人的血未注入前他們便在亞非利加洲有了奮進和努力而且在美國治下的黑人天才作家自始至終没有如何接受白種人的影響而在作品中少有白種人的痕跡所以第二步他們對於美國文化的貢獻對於藝術和文學的獻倒反比英國人給與美國的還要强烈雖然美國人是想排斥美國文化和文學中的尼格羅影響但是愈想屏絶而他們的勢力却愈見的濃重這點可參看黑人淮提（Clarencecameionwhite）底黑人給與「美國音之貢獻」（NogrosgifttoAmericanMusic）及洛克（AlainLocke）底「美國文化中的尼格羅人」（TheNegroinAmericanCulture）和士喬萊（Schuyler）底「我們對於美國的最大貢獻」（OurGreatestgifttoAmerican）所以雖然經過了許多年的陶鎔和泡浸非惟不能把他們的民族性銷磨反使他們能在美國文化的主潮上巍然獨存由此便可想見黑人的民族性是如何的强烈了</p>
<p>但是在小說上的民族性的表現却要以最近爲明白因爲早年他們還少有顧信自從有了有色人種國民改進協會（NationalAssociationfortheAdvancernentofcoloredpeople）後他們在作品中所表現的便更尖銳化了在這羣小說家中有許多是這會的主持者有許多是專在文學作品中含蓄着他們的熱忱來興奮黑人所以自然而然的便把他們的一切信號從小說作品中放出了雖然在量上不多但是已可以槪見黑人的要求自由是很顯然的了</p>
<p>「隂影」（abadow）底作者愛德華兹（HarryStillwellEdwords）在這短篇小說中描寫一個十四歲的尼格羅小孩因爲盜刦而下獄竟爲他定下了二十年在礦山作苦工的罪案後來典獄的三個姑娘向他的父親要以這黑小孩的釋放作爲她們聖誕節的禮物便繳倖的得了自由很明白的刻畫着白人對於黑奴罪案的苛刻雖然他得了釋放也不過是白人把他當成了一件禮物並未把他當成人隱隱的暗示着尼格羅人要尋找自己的出路突平（EdnaTurpin）的「亞柏南姆底自由」（AbramsFreedom）是寫美國内戰後解放黑奴的故事黑奴亞柏南姆愛上自由的少婦愛米林（Emmeline）愛米林把他的愛人作爲人生中的最高理想I</p>
<h3>白鵝畫會陳秋草作</h3>
<p>I</p>
<p>在亞柏南姆替主人當多年的馬夫以求自由的時光中愛米林已努力的帮助伊的丈夫獲得自由雖然後來得到自由後仍想住在主人家中工作但由此可見黑奴他是如何的想求得自由從白人的勢力下解放從白人的手中爭回已失的自由了鄧肯（NarmanDuncar）底「一件假設事」（Ahypotbeticalcase）很明白描寫白人痛打黑人的孩子而黑人的孩子没有打他的權利夏芝（LBYates）底「白墨戲」（TheChalkGame）是描寫黑人的孩子在競技中的命運的失敗很明白的表示黑種人底超越性質</p>
<p>以上的一作者都是很平和的但是自從一九一二年小說家波依土（WBurghardtDuBois）在阿特南塔（Atlarta）底講演發出後黑人已經對於美國人作了新的控訴所以在那時以後的小說家所描寫的便都轉了方向從緩和的領域而到了繳烈的階叚所以瓦爾特淮特（WalterWbite）底「在燧石中的火」（Fireiptheflint）中他擇選了一個醫生</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>作爲他的民族主義的宣傳者女作家浮色德（JessieFauset）在「羞恥」（Thereconfusion）把一個跳舞者當成伊底光明的象徵那生（NhllaLarsen）在「流沙」Quicksand）把一個黑人的小學敎師作爲他描寫的主人公在革命小說家波依士底「黑的公主」（ThedarkprnessClaude）中描寫一個傲慢的婦人來作爲他所想創造的英雄更是在黑克開（MckayHome）底「回哈倫」（toHarlemRudolpb）和非塞（Fisher）底「吉里柯底墻」（TheWallsofGericho）兩篇小說中更明明的在描寫黑人與白人間的挑戰把尼格羅人求自由的熱烈已描寫到了不可再緩的時機了所以最能代表黑人的民族主義的小說家還是要算後面這一羣人因爲在他們的作品中可以看見「新的尼格羅人」（NewNegro）可以把提到「尼格羅民族之興起」（NegroReuoissonce）</p>
<p>現在黑人的小說因爲他們的自覺作品是在轉向實地生活和喚醒民族意識方面的努力所以黑人洛克在他的「黑人給予美國文化的貢獻」文中說</p>
<p>「我們年青的尼格羅藝術爱應當不用羞慚和畏懼的表現我們黑皮膚者的一切生活思想活動假如白人是願意那我們也喜歡假如他們不喜歡那也不要緊我們知道我們是美麗的我們認爲我們是優秀的民族我們要爲明白建造殿堂我們知道怎様的堅强我們站在高峻的山自由在我們自己的身内」（引用黑人哈黑士（LangstonHughes）黑人文學運動的宣言）</p>
<p>到那時他們的民族興起了也正如布洛勒（BejaominBrawley）說</p>
<p>「我們將有一天有我們偉大的國家的計劃我們將有一天有捍衛人民的政府將有一天我們的孩子不再爲礦山或機械的奴隸我們將有上帝爲我們的民族定下的選民居留地」</p>

<h3>瓊斯底奇特的性格</h3>
<p>這位剛剛在去歲才逝世的英國十九世紀大戲劇家瓊斯先生是誰都知道他是那時英國戲劇復興中的健將因爲在十九世紀末葉時節統治英國劇壇的潛勢力有三方面第一個潛勢力是一般人民的舊道德觀念束縛了作者的思想第二個潛勢力便是那個古代非商業性的組織就像是一個鬼怪様地盤踞着劇塲之中最後的一個潛勢力乃是現代劇底供給專門依賴别國的作品由了這三種勢力的支配英國的劇壇一直沈默了幾十年至瓊斯出後乃以一種新創的風格完全脫離了舊的束縛然而我們又有誰知道這位勇敢活躍有决定力的人也還有其性格上的重大的弱點呢</p>
<p>最近瓊斯的女兒宋妮夫人給她的父親編纂了一部傳記裏面告訴我們以很多關於這位大戲劇家底奇特的性格　　她告訴我們說瓊斯常常地缺少感覺常常地具着很深的成見不必要地喜歡和人家辯論他在急躁的時候和人家吵嘴而在空閒的時候也並不後悔他的生命京像是一種戰陣和進行曲様的他繼續不斷地在攻擊一些人或什麽事件　　他曾有過好幾年的時間都是在申斥辱駡着他的老友蕭伯納而蕭伯納則在他的七十歲的生日上覆他以寛大而和善的信札</p>
<p>他又常常夢想着騎了一匹好馬在長瑪斯頓草地追隨着克倫威爾將軍之後衝鋒陷陣因爲他的脈管中具有威爾士和薩克孫民族的血液他自會很殘忍很機警而又很大胆了這兩種不同的血液在他的脈管中交流言所以他常以爲他那把常懸着的闊柄的劍便是一首很莊嚴的散文用之來傷戮他所看到的那個時代中的罪惡的愚蠢的人們以及那些促進和鼓勵這些事的人們的（梅筠）</p>

<p>Nanjing, Xu Yuanquan telegram, 24th: The enemy here has repeatedly launched fierce attacks on our entire line, but they have all been repelled.

<p>Nanjing, Staff Office of the Eighth Division telegram: Since the rebel army sent Ji Hongchang, Liang Guanying, and other units to attack with all their strength, they have been defeated by our allied forces and suffered heavy losses.

<p>Resolution of the Political Council's Foreign Affairs Group</p>
<p>Nanjing: Regarding the scope of the Sino-Russian conference, although the Russian side has requested expansion to include commercial treaties, navigation, and mutual dispatch of consuls, etc., Mo Dehui has consistently adhered to the original plan set by the central government and strongly opposed it. He has also telegraphed the focal points of the dispute between the two sides to the National Government and the diplomatic authorities. The Foreign Affairs Group of the Central Political Council has discussed this in detail and ultimately decided that the scope of the conference will be premised on the China Eastern Railway. Other issues will be subject to temporary decisions based on the situation after the China Eastern Railway negotiations are resolved. The central government has telegraphed this intention to Mo to proceed step by step. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Beiping Expanded Committee Continues Discussion of Party and Government Organization</h3>
<p>Second Talk to be Held Today</p>
<p>Beiping Evening News reports that the formation of the government is under discussion. The second talk of the Expanded Committee tomorrow may determine the formal meeting schedule. Those expected to attend are Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, Wang Faqin, Bai Yunti, Zhu Jiqing, Gu Mengyu, Chen Bijun, Zou Lu, Qin Zhen, Xie Chi, Fu Rulin, Mao Zuquan, Zhao Pilian, and Xue Dubi. Those attending the meetings are Huang Shaogu, Mai Huanzhang, and Liu Kuangwen. This morning, Wang conferred with Zhao, Xue, Jia, Huang, and others to discuss choosing a location near Shijiazhuang to meet with Yan and Feng. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Today, after returning to his residence, Wang Jingwei met with representatives from Tianjin, saying that his purpose in coming was to promote the Expanded Conference. In the future, the affairs of various places should be carefully investigated and promoted. He hoped that workers would not use attacks against capitalists, and merchants against shopkeepers. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Beiping: The Expanded Committee today continues to discuss standing committees and departments, all adopting a committee system. It is proposed to establish a Supervisory Yuan to supervise the government, deleting and revising the original eight articles of the party constitution, etc., into a committee system and establishing the Supervisory Yuan in advance. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Today, Wang Jingwei went to the Western Hills, accompanied by his secretary Zeng Zhongming and others. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Today, the two party departments in Beiping hosted the press, stating that since the Beiping party affairs organ was stolen and printed, there is another district joint office and a city-wide party member congress, and a temporary executive committee. There are already several party affairs organs, causing comrades to be unclear about the truth and the public unable to recognize them. Now we have expanded the organization and elected 35 executive committee members, which is more formal than other organizations. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Attitude Toward Beiping Representatives</h3>
<p>Deferral of Meeting Leaves Room for Consideration</p>
<p>Beiping, Huludao: Zhang Zuoyou telegraphed a certain gentleman in the Northeast stationed in Beiping, saying that the Northeast should treat the arrival of the three representatives with friendly meetings, but hopes that they will not involve themselves in party, government, or military affairs, and remain relatively independent. (27th)</p>
<p>Beiping: External sources say that Wang Shuhan has already telegraphed Wei Daofeng, saying that the date for the meeting with the three representatives still needs to be considered, so Guo, Xue, and Jia must wait a few more days before going to Huludao. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>The Problem of a Fictitious Gold Standard</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Plans to Convene a Meeting</p>
<p>Nanjing: Regarding the adoption of the gold standard, the Central Political Council has reviewed it several times. As a result, the Executive Yuan transferred the matter to the Ministry of Finance, instructing it to prepare the procedures for implementing the fictitious gold standard and the national implementation procedures. The Ministry of Finance is also carefully considering this matter. According to those familiar with currency policy, China's currency system is unusually complex, and the implementation of a fictitious gold standard cannot be achieved in a short period of time. It is found that the currency system currently circulating in various places can be divided into two types: one, provinces and cities use silver as the standard; two, counties and border provinces use copper as the standard. Silver is further divided into mill pieces and dollars, and copper is divided into single copper coins and double copper coins. If this system is implemented suddenly, it will inevitably cause many disputes among the people, except in the cities. Therefore, the financial authorities are conducting detailed research and plan to convene an important meeting of the financial commissioners of various provinces, special financial commissioners, and representatives from the banking and commercial sectors as the first step, to solicit information on the currency systems in each region and discuss the steps for implementing the fictitious gold standard. The date of the meeting will be decided soon. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Weisheng Warship Assists in Suppressing Communist Bandits in Qichun</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Naval News: The Weisheng warship was ordered to sail to Qichun. When passing through Liuye Temple, it happened to see Communist bandits on the mountain engaged in fierce fighting with the garrison troops. The warship seized the opportunity to attack, using machine guns to strafe and annihilate many bandits. Afterwards, it continued to pursue and suppress the bandits at Huangsang Estuary, causing the bandits to flee in disarray. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Postal Workers' Slowdown</h3>
<p>Beiping Postal Workers Have Resumed Work</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Tianjin Postal Workers' Union established a slowdown committee at 9:00 AM on the 26th. It was divided into general affairs, public relations, inspection, documentation, propaganda, and inspection departments. It immediately issued an order to all branch offices to uniformly slow down work and issued a notice that all ordinary mail sent to various provinces and this port would be delivered free of charge. Other bureau affairs and letters would be handled according to the old regulations. The administration and branch offices all posted slowdown slogans, and inspection teams maintained order. The situation was tense. A letter was also sent to the municipal government, the garrison headquarters, the military police headquarters, the social affairs bureau, and the public security bureau, stating that social order and rear security would not be disturbed during the slowdown and asking for sympathy.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Japan's So-Called National Defense Deficiencies</h3>
<p>Japan has sparked a debate over national defense deficiencies due to the London Naval Treaty issue. The so-called national defense deficiencies are merely the words of expert plans. Even if military preparations are not reduced as experts say, how can one guarantee victory and not defeat in the event of war? Therefore, I say that the origin of the argument about national defense deficiencies is mostly a shield for national finances and military expenditures. If the nation's finances are insufficient to meet the needs of military preparations, then reductions in national finances are inevitable, and on the military front, reductions in the deployment of military preparations during peacetime are insufficient to cope with the situation. Thus, a contradiction arises, and the argument about national defense deficiencies arises. If this were not the case, Japan had never been invaded by others before its military preparations today. Could it be that having today's military preparations, national defense has the defect of fearing invasion? This is impossible.</p>
<p>I said at the London Naval Disarmament Conference that the reason why countries advocate disarmament is not because they truly have the intention to eliminate war, but because competition among countries and expansion of military preparations will be financially unsustainable. Because of the lack of finances, there will be reductions in military preparations. If the finances of various countries increase day by day, as before the European War, I am afraid that countries would not be able to expand their military preparations and would never be willing to reduce them. The meaning of disarmament is originally to cause national defense deficiencies in various countries without the outbreak of war. Now, if one wants to reduce military preparations and also wants national defense to have no defects, how can there be such a non-contradictory and all-encompassing thing in the world? The debate over national defense deficiencies in Japan today shows that Japan's disarmament is not out of sincerity.</p>
<h3>Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams</h3>
<p>According to Zhou Bingwen of the General Affairs Department of the Slowdown Committee, the Nanjing General Bureau did not respond to the demands of the Tianjin postal workers. Song Shuo, the assistant manager of the Tianjin Post Office, yesterday promised to deliver mail free of charge for the Beiping slowdown and not to demand arrears from the recipients. However, a secret order was issued last night, ordering postal offices in various counties and towns in the province to demand arrears from recipients of mail that was delivered free of charge due to the slowdown. The inspection department has discovered this secret order and is currently studying countermeasures. Song told reporters that the postal workers came yesterday afternoon to demand a response to various matters within 30 hours. The bureau had no authority to make a decision and telegraphed the general bureau to request a response on its behalf. The slowdown suddenly began at 9:00 AM on the 26th, which was still seven hours before the 30-hour deadline. This was somewhat rash. Now that the general bureau has not replied, there is no way to mediate. The bureau yesterday issued an order to postal offices in various counties to have recipients pay arrears for mail without postage stamps, which was issued before the Tianjin postal slowdown. Other measures will be determined later. Although this is called a slowdown, work is actually proceeding as usual, only the delivery of ordinary mail without postage stamps is delayed. Postal assistants and above have not participated in the slowdown. The military and political authorities have not interfered with the slowdown. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Tianjin Postal Administration received a telegram from the Nanjing General Bureau on the evening of the 26th, stating: "Telegram received. Your request to revise salary regulations should wait for a comprehensive plan. As for the rice subsidy, please coordinate with the Beiping postmaster to address this." The telegram was discovered by the slowdown inspection department. The public felt that the telegram's response was not thorough and decided to continue the slowdown. There are still second and third steps of measures that are not willing to be announced at the moment. It is rumored that the second step is to ask the Tianjin Administration to first acknowledge and implement the conditions requested by the Tianjin Workers' Union, and then ask the General Bureau to retroactively approve them.</p>
<p>(27th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: At 9:00 AM on the 27th, the Tianjin Postal Slowdown Committee sent representatives Gao Yibang and Zhou Bingwen to see Song Shuo, the assistant manager of the Post Office. Song said that the General Bureau's reply instructed on the method, which had been discussed with Postmaster A Liangxi over the phone. A said that it was Sunday today and no business was being conducted. He would meet with the union representatives after the Beiping situation was resolved, but the Beiping postal workers had already been given a rice subsidy on the 27th and resumed work. It is hoped that the Tianjin postal workers will be treated the same as the Beiping postal workers, and the situation should be resolved on the 28th. However, the Slowdown Committee was deeply dissatisfied with A Liangxi's disregard for the slowdown and his failure to seek a quick resolution. The public opinion is that if the Beiping postal workers are given a rice subsidy, all postal workers in the province must be given the same subsidy and cannot be limited to this city alone. It is feared that there is still a problem on this point. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Russian Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Litvinov's Speech</p>
<p>Moscow, 26th (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram) - The new Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissar, Litvinov, declared to foreign reporters that Soviet Russia's foreign policy will remain consistent, focusing on consolidating the achievements of the revolution and resisting foreign intervention. Soviet Russia is currently striving to integrate socialist and capitalist systems, as the authorities have recognized the immense difficulties of building and maintaining a socialist country amidst capitalist nations. Fortunately, various countries have their own political and economic ambitions, making it difficult for them to unite against Russia. Soviet Russia's socialist transformation requires the consolidation of economic relations with industrialized nations, which is not only beneficial to the Soviet Union but also allows these nations to sell their products in the vast Soviet market. Now, some people, driven by commercial jealousy, seek to undermine economic relations with Russia, which will undoubtedly fail. He concluded by saying that the Soviet Russian government is willing to sincerely support disarmament and is determined to expose the hypocrisy of those who say one thing and do another.</p>
<h3>New Financial Orders Issued by the German President</h3>
<p>Regarding Budget and Finance Bills</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram) - German President Hindenburg signed several orders today regarding budget and finance bills. These bills, which previously led to the dissolution of the Reichstag, are now being implemented through administrative orders. However, once the elections in September are completed and the new Reichstag is convened, these orders must be immediately submitted for ratification. The new taxes announced include the long-disputed special tax on civil servant salaries, unmarried tax on adult men and women, and city poll tax. In addition, there is an increase in general income tax. The orders also address improvements to the unemployment fund, the method of paying sickness insurance, and the rejection of all additional demands for war veteran pensions. The orders also mention that the national budget has been reduced to 1.5 million marks and express hope that these measures will be sufficient to cover this year's budget deficit and promote financial consolidation.</p>
<h3>International Labor Conference</h3>
<p>Our Country's Representative's Attendance</p>
<p>Geneva Correspondence (Kuomintang News Agency) - The Geneva International Labor Conference was held from June 10th to June 30th, with representatives from 54 countries attending. The Chinese labor delegation, appointed by the Central Standing Committee in May, included Fang Juehui as the representative, Zhu Shikang, a member of the Regulations Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, as the advisor, and He Xiulan, a specialist from the Ministry of Railways, as the secretary. They traveled to Europe via the United States, where they were received by embassies and consulates along the way without any hindrance. After reporting to Geneva, Zhu Shikang contacted representatives from various countries, allowing the Chinese labor delegation to be elected to the Convention Review Committee and the Workers' Working Hours Committee stipulated in Article 408 of the International Peace Treaty. It was not easy for the Chinese labor delegation to participate in these committees, as many countries were competing to join. On the 16th, during the conference, Zhu Shikang, representing Fang Juehui, took the stage to speak about the oppression of Chinese laborers by imperialist countries and detailed the May 30th Massacre and the abuse of Chinese workers in Japanese yarn factories. After the speech, representatives from various countries applauded. The British representative also took the stage to express sympathy. At the time, the Japanese representatives, feeling ashamed, successively withdrew from the meeting and secretly discussed methods of retaliation. However, Zhu's speech was stern and righteous, leaving no room for attack. When they attended the meeting the next day, they did not express much. On the 24th, Zhu Shikang took the stage again to speak about workers' working hours and forced labor, which was met with applause. According to staff in the Labor Bureau, the Chinese labor delegation had a revolutionary spirit and was the most vocal of all previous representatives. Finally, the Chinese labor delegation proposed a motion entitled "International Labor Should Be Treated Equally" because the treatment of Chinese workers in foreign factories and stores is often lower than that of foreigners. Currently, representative Fang Juehui and advisor Zhu Shikang have gone to Germany and France for observation and are expected to return to China in mid-August.</p>
<h3>French Labor Strike Spreads</h3>

<p>Lille, France, 26th (Reuters) - 15,000 textile workers and 60 percent of metal workers in this city are now on strike because employers refuse to increase wages to compensate for the fees workers must pay under the insurance law. Paris, 26th (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram) - The labor unrest in northern France is intensifying as employers firmly refuse to negotiate with workers and the Communists are instigating a general strike on the 28th. Clashes between strikers and volunteer workers are incessant. The authorities have not only increased police presence but have also dispatched troops and the Republican Guard to suppress the unrest.</p>
<p>Italian King Inspects Disaster Area Rome, 26th (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram) - The clearing work after the earthquake continues day and night. So far, 2,300 bodies have been buried, many of which are incomplete and unrecognizable. Due to the hot weather, the bodies decompose easily, and many are buried only wrapped in blankets without coffins. As a result, the disaster area is filled with a stench, no less than a battlefield. The Italian King witnessed the tragedy and was almost sickened by the stench, but he continued to inspect and console the victims. The total number of deaths and losses cannot be accurately known until after another week.</p>
<p>Rome, 26th (Reuters) - The official earthquake report, based on the survey as of 8 pm last night, counts 2,142 dead and 4,551 injured. It is expected that the number of deaths and injuries will continue to increase.</p>

<h3>Japanese Prime Minister's Remarks on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Electric News Agency) - Prime Minister Hamaguchi went to the Hayama Imperial Villa yesterday to meet with the Emperor, stating that he had seen the advisory document from the Military Council. The Emperor granted him a private lunch. After lunch, he left the Kamakura villa at 2:30 pm and spoke to reporters about the current situation as follows: The procedures for consulting the Privy Council regarding the London Treaty have long been completed, and preliminary review should not take a week. After the Privy Council establishes a thorough investigation committee, the government does not intend to separately ask each committee member for understanding. I certainly cannot engage in this kind of behind-the-scenes lobbying. I intend to fully explain with sincerity at the committee meeting. This is the right way. Before reading the advisory document from the Council of Military Advisors, the temporary cabinet decided to request consultation with the Privy Council, which some criticized as reversing the procedure, but I do not know the reason for this criticism. When I met with Speaker Kuratomi, I told him that this was a major issue and hoped that it would be considered even during the summer recess, so the Privy Council should have understood this point. The government will proceed with the disarmament and tax reduction relationship according to the original plan and has not changed in the slightest. Even the remaining funds for supplementary projects will be used entirely for tax reduction. Starting next year, suspending the manufacture of main battleship shells can save 10 to 20 million yuan annually. From Showa 7 (1932), the subsidy for fleet expenses can also be reduced. There may be a misunderstanding that the government has changed its budget policy due to reduced revenue. In fact, there will be some surplus in the 6th year, but only a small amount of basic financial resources. Although there has been some criticism for lowering the interest rate on postal savings, this is determined by the general interest rate situation and is unavoidable. Compiling next year's budget is extremely difficult due to the sharp decline in revenue. I have served in the Ministry of Finance for many years, and this kind of financial hardship is a first. Naturally, it will be less than the budget implemented in the fifth year, so all new projects are not approved, but relief for unemployment should be considered separately. Even if it is only a part of the military system reform, I hope it will be included in next year's budget.</p>
<h3>Activities of the Egyptian Nationalist Party</h3>
<p>Cairo, 26th (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram) - On Saturday, due to the strict precautions taken by the military police and the Nationalist Party Executive Committee's strong prohibition of violence by its members, no major riots occurred, but the atmosphere remained tense and people were panicked. Nationalist Party members were quite elated because, although their party's congressmen were suppressed by the government, they were still able to hold a meeting at the Sate Club at midnight and pass a resolution of no confidence in the government and to start a tax resistance and non-cooperation movement. Former Prime Minister Nahas expressed in his speech that he firmly believed in the effectiveness of the tax resistance and non-cooperation methods and strongly disapproved of any attempts to overthrow the cabinet by riots.</p>
<h3>European Aviation Competition</h3>
<p>Poźnań, 26th (Reuters) - Although the weather was unfavorable, British pilot Butler was the first to arrive in Poznan, Poland, in the European International Aviation Competition.

Browder's average speed so far is 109 miles per hour. If he can maintain this, he can get a speed score of 210 points.</p>

<h3>Soviet Russian Spy Caught in New York</h3>
<p>New York, 26th (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram) - U.S. District Attorney Doddle today filed charges against two criminals for smuggling Swiss watches.

The two criminals confessed that they had more than 600 watches and symbols of Soviet Russian government spies. In addition, there are several account books. According to the account books, these large quantities of watches are actually the property of the Soviet Russian Amtorg Trading Corporation in the United States. The account books also contain the names of 25 Soviet Russian spies stationed in the United States, China, and Japan. One of the criminals has confessed that he is related to the Amtorg Trading Corporation and that the watches belong to the group. Both criminals stated that they are originally from Soviet Russia. The case is scheduled to open on August 7. Both criminals were released on bail of US$15,000 each.</p>

<h3>Musser's Talk on Far East Inspection</h3>
<p>Washington, 26th (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram) - Mr. Musser, Director of the Far East Department of the U.S. Department of Commerce, returned today from an inspection tour.</p>
<p>Speaking of the situation in China, he said that there are three major reasons for China's economic depression: (1) civil war; (2) the impact of the downward trend of world prices on China's products; and (3) the sharp fall in silver prices. China is not responsible for the second and third reasons. If world prices and silver prices can recover, China's economy can gradually improve. The civil war is entirely a matter for China itself, and the Chinese must find a solution themselves. Other countries cannot overstep their bounds. Other Far Eastern countries have made significant progress, especially Japan.</p>

<h3>Dispute Over the Boundary Between Danyang Lake and Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces</h3>
<p>Ministry of Interior Sends Commissioner to Re-Survey</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence - Danyang Lake, located between Jiangsu and Anhui provinces and shared by Gaochun County in Jiangsu and Dangtu and Xuancheng counties in Anhui, covers an area of ​​more than 70,000 mu and has two canals, Chenggou River and Yunliang River. During the Ming Dynasty, the people of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces had disputes due to the heavy water conservancy. Recently, the sea has become a mulberry field, and most of the lake has accumulated into shoals and has become fertile land. The competition for profit is even more fierce. In September of last year, the Ministry of Interior of the National Government, due to the endless disputes between the people of the two provinces, in order to avoid conflicts between the people and to clarify administrative jurisdiction, once sent Xu Yili to join forces with Xu Jihua and Yanquan from the Jiangsu Provincial Committee, Zhang Guohua and Zhang Guangxin from the Anhui Provincial Committee, and Deng Hanqiu, the former county magistrate of Dangtu, to conduct a joint survey. Later, a meeting was held in Beijing. At that time, the ministry's arbitration opinion was to assign the three small dikes near Kongjiaguai South of Chenggou River to Gaochun County, Jiangsu Province, and to establish the Yunliang River Center as the boundary between the provinces. After reporting to the Executive Yuan for approval, the officials and people of Anhui Province also believed that the dispute over this case was too deep and had been delayed for a long time. The people's livelihood had been affected and the administrative management was also difficult. Determining the provincial boundary was a prerequisite, and they were willing to abandon their prejudices and accept arbitration. As for reclamation and water conservancy, they belonged to another matter and should be resolved separately after the provincial and county boundary lines were drawn. However, Jiangsu Province insisted that reclamation and water conservancy were a prerequisite, and the case could not be decided. The Ministry of Interior believed that prolonging the delay was not appropriate and that it was necessary to re-survey and determine the boundaries. In addition to re-consulting the governments of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces to send commissioners again, the ministry specially appointed Xiang Xiaoliu and Xi Qiyin as the Boundary Committee of Gaochun, Dangtu, and Xuancheng counties in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. Anhui Province appointed Zhang Jiaoxin and Qi Qun, and Jiangsu Province appointed Wang Yu and Wu Zezhong as the Boundary Committee for the re-survey of the three counties of Gao, Dang, and Xuan. The commissioners from the Ministry and the provinces have arrived in Wuhu one after another yesterday. Jiang Zhongya, the county magistrate of Dangtu, also came to Wuhu from Dangtu yesterday to receive them and set off together for Dangtu this morning to begin the survey, with the expectation that it will be completed in three days and then choose a suitable location, either in Beijing or in Wuhu, to hold a joint meeting to determine the provincial boundary and erect a monument to end the disputes forever. As for the people of the entire county of Dangtu, Danyang Lake is located in Dangtu County, accounting for seven or eight tenths, and the Dangtu County Chronicle also states that Danyang Lake is entirely under the jurisdiction of Dangtu. At the time of the commission to survey, a support association was organized by the people of the entire county of Dangtu to maintain Danyang Lake and strive for unity (26th).</p>
<h3>Qingdao Rickshaw Pullers' Strike</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Rickshaw pullers in Qingdao Municipality, facing difficulties due to an increase in rental fees by the owners from 30 cents to 45 cents per day, which they found unbearable, requested assistance from the Party and government. Labor-management disputes have been brewing for months. The Municipal Steering Committee previously sent a letter to the Municipal Government, instructing the Rickshaw Pullers' Association to maintain the 30-cent rental fee until a resolution was reached. However, the owners insisted on the original proposal and refused to yield. Consequently, all rickshaw pullers in the city went on strike on the 21st. At 8:00 AM, over a thousand rickshaw pullers gathered and went to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau to petition for the reinstatement of the 30-cent fee. However, the authorities believed that someone must be instigating this unrest. Therefore, when the rickshaw pullers went on strike, the Public Security Bureau summoned and detained Liu Changsheng, a member of the Rickshaw Pullers' Workers' Preparation Committee. On the 22nd, the rickshaw pullers continued their strike and went en masse to Party and government offices to demand the following conditions: (1) The Municipal Government should issue a public notice to maintain the 30-cent rental fee; (2) Release Workers' Preparation Committee member Liu Changsheng. No results were achieved. At noon, they again crowded the Public Security Bureau, requesting the release of Liu Changsheng. The Bureau dispatched Chief Inspector Dong Rongqing to persuade the crowd to disperse and await a resolution, stating that they could not release Liu Changsheng without instructions from the Municipal Government. While the rickshaw pullers were petitioning, the First and Second Branches of the Public Security Bureau and the Security Team dispatched units to maintain order, fortunately preventing any incidents. On the 23rd, the Public Security Bureau took precautionary measures, increasing double posts at all key roads and dispatching the Security Team to station at major intersections for prevention. The rickshaw pullers did not stage any gatherings or petitions that day but strictly prohibited all rickshaw pullers from resuming work privately.</p>
<p>Today (the 24th) is the fourth day of the strike, and both sides still show no signs of a resolution. The Municipal Government, considering the current military situation and fearing that prolonged deadlock might lead to other incidents, has taken measures to maintain the city's security. On one hand, it posted a public notice sternly ordering the rickshaw pullers to resume work immediately. On the other hand, it ordered the Public Security Bureau to surround the Rickshaw Pullers' Workers' Union on Shanghe Road, arresting and interrogating committee members Zhu Xizhen and Zhang Junji, as well as secretary Song Xianzhu. Police officers were also dispatched to monitor the residences of the rickshaw pullers. Multiple vehicles were prepared for emergency deployment to prevent unexpected events. The rickshaw pullers mostly remained at home and have not yet expressed their stance. It remains uncertain whether they will resume work. The Municipal Government's public notice is as follows: "Considering that the Central armies are currently besieging Jinan, Qingdao's location in the rear is critically important for maintaining security. We cannot allow reactionary elements to use labor unrest as a pretext to disrupt the situation. This government previously received a secret order from the Central Government to temporarily suspend all labor movement activities during this military period. Furthermore, we received a letter from the Municipal Party Headquarters stating that no acts of negligence or disruption of order are allowed, based on the Central Government's instructions. The current rickshaw pullers' strike, under the pretext of rent reduction, has been ongoing for three days, and it is reported that there are reactionary elements instigating and forcing rickshaw pullers to obstruct traffic, attempting to disrupt our city. To maintain security in the rear, we are complying with the Central Government's secret order and the instructions of the Municipal Party Headquarters to immediately arrest the ringleaders of the instigation in order to maintain security. The Municipal Government is deeply aware of the rickshaw pullers' difficult livelihoods and is currently investigating their living conditions to seek a fair resolution for both owners and pullers. Before a resolution is reached, all rickshaw pullers should comply with the previous agreement reached with the Municipal Party Headquarters to temporarily pay a rental fee of 38 cents. From today onward, everyone must resume work as usual. Any further acts of instigation will be considered as disrupting the rear and will be punished accordingly." (July 24th)</p>
<h3>Wuchang to Establish a Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Wuchang, the site of the first uprising in the Xinhai Revolution, occupies a strategically important location. Its commerce is thriving. The Hubei Provincial Government and important administrative organs are all located there. When the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Wuhan, there was a proposal to establish Wuchang as a special municipality. However, because Hankou's commerce was even more prosperous and it was a famous commercial port in China, and because its personnel were more complex and its construction was more important than that of Wuchang, Hankou was designated as a special municipality and a municipal government was established. Wuchang remained the provincial capital and was not made a municipality. Instead, a municipal affairs conference was established under the Provincial Government Committee to discuss municipal facilities. Several months ago, the provincial government committees considered Wuchang's important position and believed that local security and all facilities should have an independent organization to take special responsibility. Therefore, there was another proposal to establish a Wuchang Municipal Government. However, Provincial Chairman He Chengjun was occupied with the intense fighting at the front and had no time for this. He telegraphed the provincial government committees, stating that the most important task at the moment was the progress of the military effort. All administrative organs in the province that had been established should be examined for their achievements to avoid being set up in vain. Those that had not been established should be temporarily postponed until the military effort was over, so as to conserve expenses. From then on, the progress of the Wuchang Municipal Government was again halted, due to the impact of the military situation. According to news from the provincial government, Provincial Chairman He Chengjun yesterday again telegraphed the province, saying that Wuchang is a district of revolutionary righteousness, urgently in need of construction to benefit the citizens and enhance its appearance. The Wuchang Municipal Government should be organized and established immediately, and Provincial Government Committee member Xiong Bingkun should be appointed as the mayor concurrently. The necessary regular operating expenses, in addition to the original municipal revenue, should be temporarily subsidized by the provincial treasury with 4,000 yuan per month. Once the municipal government is established, the Municipal Affairs Conference under the Provincial Government organization will be abolished in order to centralize authority. It is reported that the Provincial Government Committee has already passed this proposal today (July 25th).</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province to Conduct Second Phase of Land Reporting</h3>
<p>The first phase of land reporting in Zhejiang Province has concluded. The summary registers of all counties have been sent to the province successively. However, the content still contains many omissions and errors and is insufficient to be used as the basis for rectifying land taxes and implementing land taxes. The Department of Civil Affairs has drafted a second phase of the plan to implement field surveying. Each county government will set up a land reporting and surveying team to work with the district offices and village committees to measure the land, conduct resurveys, and ensure that the actual numbers of land area and land value are not concealed, so that the increase in grain tax will be several times higher than before. However, due to funding, personnel, and other related factors, it is difficult to carry out simultaneously. Therefore, it has been decided to consider the situation and divide the work into six phases, to be completed by 1934 in accordance with the department's deadline. The division criteria are as follows: (1) Counties that have not completed the atlas should be urged to do so. After the atlas is completed, the surveying will be ordered based on the situation. (2) Counties where the atlas has been completed but there are many mountains and it is difficult to measure, or where there are disaster or bandit areas, or where the reporting performance is better, are not planned to be measured temporarily. (3) Counties where the atlas has been completed, there are few mountains, the tax burden is heavy, and there are no bandits or disasters will be measured first. The order of surveying in each county is as follows: First phase: Yuhang, Jiaxing, Haiyan, Pinghu, Wuxing, and Shaoxing six counties, from August 1930 to July 1931, with a one-year limit. Second phase: Deqing, Yin County, Xiaoshan, Yongjia, Fuyang, Lin'an, Haining, Jiashan, Chongde, and Wukang ten counties, from February 1931 to January 1932, with a one-year limit. Third phase: Fenghua, Cixi, Zhenhai, Xiangshan, Yuyao, Jinhua, Lanxi, Qu County, Longyou, Tonglu, Chun'an, and Pingyang twelve counties, from August 1931 to July 1932, with a one-year limit. Fourth phase: Yuqian, Xindeng, Changhua, Changxing, Anji, Xiaofeng, Shangyu, Xinchang, Linhai, Wenling, Dongyang, and Yiwu twelve counties, from February 1932 to February 1933, with a one-year limit. Fifth phase: Yongkang, Jiangshan, Changshan, Jiande, Shouchang, Rui'an, Yueqing, Songyang, Jinyun, Dinghai, Nantian, Zhuji, Sheng County, Tiantai, Pujiang, and Wuyi sixteen counties, from July 1932 to June 1934, with a two-year limit. Sixth phase: Ninghai, Xianju, Tangxi, Kaihua, Suian, Fenshui, Taishun, Yuhuan, Suichang, Qingyuan, Jingning, Lishui, Yunhe, Xuanping, Qingtian, and Longquan sixteen counties, from January 1933 to December 1934, with a two-year limit. The cities of Hangzhou and Ningbo, and the counties of Hang County, Tongxiang, and Huangyan will not be surveyed again because they have already been cleared and measured.</p>
<h3>Jiang-Zhejiang Beekeeping Association to be Established on a Fixed Date</h3>
<p>To be held in Puyuan on August 1st</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have long been developed beekeeping regions. In recent years, improved breeding and the import of Italian bee species have become increasingly popular.

On the 24th, three bodies of those who drowned were found in Lubang, outside the East Gate. Because the flesh was blurred, they have not yet been identified. Those who escaped and were captured were Chen Dongsheng, Dong Guisheng, Wei Fulin, etc., a total of twelve people, who were captured by the police force and the Public Security Bureau at the seawall outside the southeast and east gates. There are still twenty-two escaped prisoners who have not been captured, including Shi A'mei, Chen Shushan, Lu Hongsheng, Cao Yongren, Wu Haitao, Wang Jingkang, etc. It is said that one of the prisoners surnamed Wang has escaped three times. It is unknown how he will escape this time. The bodies of the killed prisoners have been examined, autopsied, and buried separately by Judge Zhou Xiang. As for the uncaptured escaped prisoners, County Magistrate Shen issued a notice of reward for their arrest yesterday. County Magistrate Shen also personally comforted and rewarded the more than thirty prisoners who did not participate in the prison escape (mostly minor offenders from May and June) with money to encourage them. Jailer Liu Ou was deemed inexcusable for his negligence and timidity, so yesterday he was escorted by the police to the Fengcheng Detention Center and brought back to the Southern Office to be sent to the province for investigation. There was already a team from the Public Security Bureau stationed at the local defense, but it is feared that it is not enough. In addition to dispatching a wooden gun team on the 22nd to strengthen the defense, Battalion Commander Ding Zhiyan was ordered to go there on behalf of the County Magistrate to take charge and handle the aftermath. The County Magistrate himself went to the province this morning to report in order to request instructions.</p>

<p>Natural and Man-made Disasters in the Northern Jiangsu Salt Reclamation Area: The Northern Jiangsu Salt Reclamation Area, from Funing in the north to Sanyu in the south, consists of more than ten large and small companies. This year, the cotton crop has been severely affected by large locusts, resulting in a poor harvest. The disaster in Hu Company in Taizhou is already evident.

<p>The Prefecture Appoints Officials to Secure Advance Taxes The Huaiyun Salt Monopoly is urgently seeking to remit 390,000 yuan in advance taxes collected from salt merchants this year. With the deadline passed and only 20,000 yuan received, the Huaiyun Salt Monopoly has dispatched Section Chiefs Hu and Chen to the Sihuan Public Association to summon the salt merchants to secure the payment. It is reported that the merchants claim it is currently the off-season, and an accident occurred in Xiang'an, where stored salt permits were robbed, resulting in a loss of over 200,000 yuan. They are currently unable to transport salt for tax revenue, making it difficult to collect the taxes. It was decided to first borrow from the Bank of China and gradually repay the loan to maintain national tax revenue. Additional Patrol Ships to Protect Merchant Vessels Due to frequent bandit activity along the Jiangbei Canal, including robbery of ships, the civilian authorities previously assigned the Jialu patrol ship to patrol the area. It is now reported that the ship finds the canal's hundreds of miles of waterway difficult to patrol completely and daily, leaving potential oversights. Therefore, the Sixth District of the Public Security Bureau has requested the civilian government to assign additional patrol ships. It is now reported that the government has added the Anjing patrol ship to protect merchant vessels.</p>

<p>Unmarried Fiancée Commits Suicide for Her Deceased Fiancé Zheng Tianming, a native of Zheng'ao who previously worked at a gold shop in Hankou, was engaged to Lu Afu of Lucun last September. The wedding day was approaching, but Zheng fell ill at the shop earlier this month and returned home for treatment, which was ineffective. He passed away a few days ago.

By the time her family arrived to retrieve her, she was already deceased. Her family plans to bury her with her deceased fiancé to fulfill her wish.</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>
<p>The Municipal Preparatory Office to Temporarily Close The Bengbu Municipal Preparatory Office was established in April of last year. It was ordered to cease operations last winter due to the Shi Bu rebellion. After the Shi army retreated north and the Central Army came to Bengbu to take over defense at the beginning of February this year, the office was ordered to resume operations. The Finance Department allocated over 7,000 yuan per month for expenses, including the Bureau of Public Works budget. Since resuming operations, Director Xu Baikui has actively implemented municipal construction, but he has been hindered by economic difficulties. The Anhui Provincial Government, in order to save finances, decided to temporarily close the office at the 118th Standing Committee meeting. The office recently received a letter from Director Xu from the provincial capital, instructing it to handle the closure together with the Bureau of Public Works. All documents should be transferred to the Departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, Construction, and Education by the end of July. The salaries of the office and bureau staff for April, May, June, and July are in arrears. It is reported that the provincial government has instructed the Finance Department to issue the salaries.</p>
<p>Two Public Security Bureau Chiefs to Take Office Lu Xuchang, the current director of the Bengbu Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Zhou Qixian, the director of the Changhuai River Water Public Security Bureau, were both appointed by Gu Zhutong, the commander of the First Army of the Central Army. Last month, the Anhui Provincial Government appointed Wang Baozhong as director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and Shao Qiyong as director of the Water Public Security Bureau. The two appointees came to Bengbu to prepare to take office, but Directors Lu and Zhou, who also serve as deputy directors of the Anhui Northern Recruiting Office and Training Office of the Second Division, could not transfer their duties without orders from their superiors. As a result, Wang and Shao have been in Bengbu for a month without taking office. The Anhui Provincial Government has repeatedly telegraphed the National Government Executive Yuan and General Commander Chiang to request a swift transfer in order to maintain the administrative system. It is reported that General Commander Chiang telegraphed the garrison authorities yesterday to supervise the transfer. It is expected that Directors Wang and Shao will take office within the next few days.</p>

<h3>Letter from the Cheng Lie Physical Education Specialized School</h3>
<p>Respectfully, After reading your newspaper's Suzhou dispatch on July 23rd, we noted the report that five students from our school were arrested after the arrest of reactionary elements in Mengzhou, allegedly for organizing the Anti-Imperialist League and engaging in propaganda. The Public Security Bureau has been searching various schools for days, and our school has also been searched twice, but no suspicious items or people have been taken away. Our school was established in memory of the Kuomintang martyr, Mr. Liu, and we only implement the Party's physical education policies and do not inquire about other ideologies. This matter concerns the school's reputation and is alarming. We respectfully request a correction. Sincerely, Suzhou Cheng Lie Physical Education Specialized School, July 26th.</p>

<h3>Wang Zhengting Discusses the Weihaiwei Case</h3>
<p>The British Have No Intention of Delaying, Absolutely Not True</p>
<p>The Handover Will Proceed Smoothly on October 10th</p>
<p>It was rumored that the ambassador to the UK, Shi Zhaoji, telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying that the British intended to delay the return of Weihaiwei and had not appointed a handover commissioner. This newspaper's reporter interviewed Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting yesterday to inquire about this matter. According to Wang, Ambassador Shi did not send such a telegram. The claim that the British intend to delay is absolutely untrue. The handover date is set for October 10th, and it is expected to proceed smoothly without any unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<h3>German Community Celebrates National Day</h3>
<p>August 11th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that August 11th is the anniversary of the promulgation of the German republican constitution. The German Consul General and the German community in Shanghai are preparing to celebrate. The German Consul General will receive congratulations at his office at 11:30 AM on that day, and the 1,200 German residents will hold their own celebrations. Germany established a temporary republican government after the abdication of its monarch and the cessation of hostilities in 1918. On November 30th, it ordered the election of representatives to organize a national assembly to formulate a constitution. The National Assembly opened in Weimar on February 6th of the following year. After several months of work, it established a republican constitution, which was promulgated by President Ebert on August 11th. The first chapter of the constitution stipulates that the German Federation is a republican state with sovereignty vested in the people. Therefore, it is widely regarded as the most democratic constitution in the world.</p>
<h3>Alarming Import of Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>From January to Mid-July</p>
<p>Worth Over 83 Million Taels of Silver</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Jiangsu, Ningbo, and Shanghai Rice Merchants held its eleventh regular meeting at Cuixiu Hall yesterday afternoon at 2 PM. Sixteen committee members attended, including Ye Huili and Zhu Zixiang. Standing Committee member Ye Huijun presided over the meeting. The chairman reported on the investigation of foreign rice in Shanghai. From January to July 15th of this year, a total of 7,513,815 bags of foreign rice arrived. 350,000 bags went to Nanjing, 160,000 bags to Tongzhou, 120,000 bags to Zhenjiang, 610,000 bags to Ningbo, 60,000 bags to Hankou, and 6,223,850 bags to Shanghai. Each bag weighs 165 catties, totaling 12,513,525 dan. The highest price was 7.7 taels, and the lowest was 5.7 taels, with an average price of 6.7 taels. The amount of silver flowing out of the country is 83,065,611 taels. Our country relies on agriculture, and the leakage of funds for rice alone is so huge, which is truly heartbreaking. Fortunately, the weather has been favorable, and a good harvest is expected in various places. We hope that there will be no changes in the autumn, which will benefit both society and the livelihood of the common people. Subsequently, a proposal from the Wuxi Rice Merchants Association was submitted, but it was deemed untimely and temporarily retained. The meeting was adjourned early due to the hot weather.</p>
<h3>Black Rice Weevil Discovered in Wusong Rice Fields</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Sends Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>Municipal Committee Employs Labor to Catch the Insects</p>
<p>The black rice weevil, commonly known as the "black stink bug" or "rice turtle," is a type of beetle, black in color, flat, and oval-shaped. It hides among rice leaves and absorbs nutrients. If these beetles are found in rice fields, the rice crop may fail and produce no grains, similar to the damage caused by rice borers. Recently, these pests have been discovered in fields in various parts of Wusong. The Social Affairs Bureau has dispatched personnel to investigate. The Wusong Municipal Committee Office ordered the village chiefs to employ labor to catch and purchase the insects to prevent future problems.</p>

<h3>Municipal Finance Bureau Streamlines Tax Collection</h3>
<p>A Conversation with Director Tang of the Bureau</p>
<p>National News Agency: Since Tang Naikang took over as acting director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, there have been many improvements. Our reporter visited Director Tang yesterday to inquire about his plans for streamlining tax collection and the internal operations of the Bureau. Director Tang provided the following answers: Regarding streamlining tax collection, all taxes will be handled in accordance with government orders. Subordinate officials will be supervised to be honest and uphold the law, ensuring that every penny is collected and turned over to the government. Unpopular practices will be strictly prohibited. In addition to streamlining existing taxes, the Bureau is working to take over the wharf tax, which has traditionally been collected by the Customs on behalf of the foreign concessions, yielding only 10,000 yuan annually to the city government. Negotiations with the concession authorities have been successful, and the wharf tax in the Chinese area will be collected by the Bureau, generating an estimated 700,000 yuan annually. The city government has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, and once the Ministry of Finance informs the Customs, the plan can be implemented. Foreign merchants in Pudong have traditionally not paid property taxes. Negotiations with British merchants have been successful, and they will comply with the regulations and pay taxes. Negotiations with other countries are also underway to achieve the same goal. Regarding internal reorganization, Director Tang stated that he prioritizes talent and seeks qualified individuals for specific tasks. After Director Xu handed over his duties and those who resigned were replaced, only four individuals were newly appointed, and the appointments were reported to the municipal government for record. In general, all personnel promotions and demotions are based on fairness and the ability to perform duties, without any bias. The rumors circulating recently about personnel changes are completely false. The facts are clear and do not require further explanation. As for the Bureau's management of the city's finances, everything is transparent and accessible. However, as some citizens may not be fully aware of the details through the Bureau's internal business publications, the Bureau plans to publish a quarterly journal that will include all daily administrative revenue and expenditure accounts, providing citizens with clear and detailed information. The inaugural issue is expected to be published around September. At this point, Director Tang had important business to attend to, and the reporter took his leave.</p>
<h3>News on the Franco-Chinese Water and Electricity Strike</h3>
<p>The strike by workers at the French-owned French Electric Power Company has been ongoing for forty days without resolution. The following is a report on yesterday's developments:</p>
<p>Number of Detainees: The total number of workers from the union who were injured and detained on Malan Road on July 21st is 24, as previously reported in this newspaper. However, it has been learned that seven more people who were passing by on Malan Road in the French Concession were detained by patrol officers. A detailed list of their names has been compiled as follows: Li Amao, Zhang Fubao, Zhao Aliu, Xu Jinbiao, Wu Fusheng, Xian Hongsheng, Huang Zhicai, Chen A'hai, Xue Genquan, Qian Ashun, Gu Er, Wu Buyun, Yang Kouzi, Zhu Wensheng, Xu Shigui, Zhang Xiaodi, Yuan A'gen, Zhang Aliu, Zheng Shunrong, Dong Shiping, Liu Zhaogan, Mao Zhongxiao, Yao Amao, Jiang Zhanggen, Huang Baogen, Zhou Wenji, Xu Zhengcai, Xu Awu, Feng Shixiu, and Zhou Guoxiang, Liu Jinxiang, a total of 31 people.</p>
<p>Strike Meeting: The strike committee met at 10 AM yesterday. Chairman Xu A'mei reported that the French Consul had proposed four conditions. The third condition, as reported in the newspaper, referred to "accepting the massacre," which was a misunderstanding of compensation. The fourth condition, the dismissal of over one hundred workers, cannot be accepted by the union, and the city party headquarters will also likely reject it. Subsequently, the committee discussed key issues: (1) If the company is sincere in accepting the conditions, it should first release all detained workers to allow for mediation. The committee will consider this a prerequisite. (2) The committee will use severe measures to deal with the company's lackeys. In the afternoon at 3 PM, Xu A'mei summoned representatives from all departments of the vehicle and engine departments, attended by over 600 people, to report that the factory had expressed acceptance of the conditions but was still not sincere. The French Consul's proposed conditions were then presented for discussion, and they were unanimously rejected. Dai Hansen was appointed as the chief representative for the vehicle department.</p>
<p>Vehicle Department Meeting: The entire vehicle department's outdoor staff held a meeting yesterday, chaired by Li Guoxiang. The following key issues were resolved: (1) Wen Fusheng, the head of the driving department, Li Shengshu, the head of the ticket sales department, and other inspectors, ticket checkers, ticket writers, and open-air staff who did not attend the meeting will receive a final warning. They must attend the meeting today, or the union will not be responsible for any accidents that occur. (2) The conditions mediated by the French Consul are completely rejected.</p>
<p>Telegram of Support: The Hangzhou County Party Headquarters in Zhejiang sent a telegram of support regarding the strike by workers at the French-owned French Electric Power Company in Shanghai. The telegram read: To the entire workforce of the Shanghai French Electric Power Company Support Association: The French capitalists have, within our country's territory, shot and killed dozens of unarmed compatriots. Their disregard for our national sovereignty and violation of humanitarian principles is outrageous. The blood of the May 30th Incident has not yet dried, and now French imperialists are again riding roughshod over our people. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Although our compatriots are suffering for the sake of their livelihood, our association believes that if a single breath remains in our nation, people from all over will rise to help. We send this telegram to express our outrage.</p>
<p>Letter to the Lawyers Association: To all esteemed lawyers: We are writing to inform you of the tragic incident on Malan Road in the French Concession on the 21st of this month, in which 24 workers were arrested. All circles are filled with grief and indignation.</p>
<p>In addition to the fact that the central government has instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seriously negotiate the matter, seven workers had been illegally arrested before the tragic incident occurred. Including those injured and arrested this time, the total number of workers detained is 31. The workers have been imprisoned innocently. We have always looked up to your esteemed profession as the leader of the legal field, protecting human rights. We sincerely request that you uphold justice and rescue these dozens of workers who have been arrested for no reason, based on the law. This will not only be the good fortune of the families of those arrested, but also the great fortune of all the striking workers. We are in urgent need of your assistance. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Letter to the Chinese Directors of the French Concession Board: Respectfully, The strike at the French Water and Electricity Company has been going on for over a month. The company's various reactionary actions have reached their peak, such as the recent tragic incident on Malan Road and the arrest and injury of as many as 24 workers. This is a blatant disregard for national law and is deeply regrettable. The arrested workers have been imprisoned for more than a week without being released. Your esteemed position as a Chinese director calls for fraternal solidarity. How can you sit idly by and watch this tragedy unfold? We are writing to sincerely request that you take steps immediately to rescue the arrested workers and free them from the clutches of the law. We eagerly await your assistance. The Strike Committee.</p>
<p>The Support Association Sends Another Letter to the French Consul: Respectfully, The occurrence of the water and electricity strike is due to the company's repeated rejections. The unfortunate tragedy of July 21st has been deeply lamented by the people of China. It is the duty of your esteemed Consul General to consider proper solutions to avert a major disaster. Our Association, unwilling to see the bankruptcy of Sino-French relations and the expansion of the strike, is writing to sincerely request that your esteemed Consul General sincerely accept the mediation of the Chinese government and order the Water and Electricity Company to formally acknowledge the demands of the labor side within three days to maintain peace and order. If a satisfactory answer is not received by the deadline, our Association vows to provide strong support. We convey this in this letter, hoping you will consider it.</p>
<p>Support Letter from the Huacheng Workers' Union: The Shanghai Huacheng Workers' Union issued a declaration yesterday to support the workers of the French Water and Electricity Company: Our beloved compatriots across the country, the workers of the French Water and Electricity Company are demanding improved treatment due to rising prices and the difficulty of making a living. This is a legitimate demand and has been approved by the authorities. However, the company not only rejected the demand, forcing a strike, but also disregarded the Chinese authorities and refused mediation, leading to the tragic July 21st incident. This shocking news is outrageous and infuriating. If we do not rise up to denounce this, the company will surely take further steps and become more arrogant. How can the striking workers survive? Seeing that the workers of the French Water and Electricity Company are in dire straits and on the verge of collapse, we must sympathize with the deceased and provide for the living. If we do not provide assistance, they will surely be destroyed. For the sake of our nation's survival, we should stand together and fight to the death. This will not only ensure the workers' victory but also reclaim the concessions and eliminate the root of the disaster. We hope that our compatriots across the country will rise up and address this issue. Our association vows to support the workers of the French Water and Electricity Company. We make this declaration.</p>
<h3>News on the Yingchang Strike</h3>
<p>Rescuing Staff from the Factory</p>
<p>The strike by all the workers at the Yingchang Match Factory in Lujia Ferry, Pudong, due to the dismissal of a worker and the confinement of the staff inside the factory, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has been learned that the entire staff was rescued from the factory at around 8 PM the previous evening by Director Yuan of the Public Security Bureau, who dispatched a police contingent led by Deputy Captain Wu with two squads of police from the Fourth Company to the factory.

Yesterday was Sunday, and most of the workers were still gathered at the factory. However, the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau were closed for the weekend and could not conduct mediation.

<h3>Minutes of the Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Lawyers Association</h3>
<p>59th Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association held its 59th joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees at its meeting place on Baylor Road in the International Settlement at 10 AM yesterday (Sunday). Those present included Yao Wenshou, Liu Zuwang, Yu Zhongluo, Zhang Enhai, Wen Chao, Wu Shoukong, Wang Chuanbi, Zhao Zuwei, Yan Yinwu, Jiang Yiping, and others. Liu Zuwang was elected chairman, and Dai Jixian recorded the proceedings. The agenda is recorded below: (1) The chairman reported that due to the failure of the Executive and Supervisory Committee meetings to reach a quorum several times, the 16th Standing Committee meeting addressed less important matters to avoid delays. He requested retroactive approval of the matters. It was resolved that all matters be approved retroactively. (2) The Ning County Lawyers Association sent a letter responding to the investigation of Zhang Shichang's murder and proposing an assistance plan. It was resolved that the case be drafted by the Ning County Association, and the Shanghai and Hangzhou Associations will assist in jointly handling the case. (3) Committee member Yu Zhongluo proposed reviewing the text of the petition submitted by member Dai Jinghuai for interpretation and requesting retroactive approval. It was resolved that retroactive approval be granted. (4) Committee member Zhao Zuwei reported on the review of member Tang Xingjian's request for interpretation of various questions regarding Article 19 of the Negotiable Instruments Law. It was resolved that the original petitioner be informed to refer to the review. (5) Supervisory Committee member Yao Wenshou proposed changing the lawyers' uniform, suggesting using a swirl pattern silver thread instead of pure white silk for the trim, as the latter was deemed inappropriate.

(6) Committee member Yu Zhongluo suggested that the Shanghai Special District Local Court should not summarily order bail for criminal self-prosecution cases, and that the disposition should be changed after a verdict of not guilty if the case is related to civil matters.

<h3>Deadline for Supplementary Procedures for Reserve Party Members to Become Full Members</h3>
<p>Complete Supplements Within Ten Days from Tomorrow</p>
<p>Forms Will Be Voided if Supplements Are Not Made After the Deadline</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Special City Party Department's Organization Department began soliciting reserve party members on December 1st of last year, until the end of March of this year, a period of four months, approximately 3,000 reserve party members were received. The City Executive Committee has successively approved them and submitted them to the Central Committee for the issuance of certificates. Recently, a small number of application forms were returned by the Central Committee due to incomplete procedures, ordering them to be supplemented. Today, a special announcement is published in the newspaper (Republic of China Daily) to order each individual to go to the department between the 29th of this month and August 7th to complete the procedures so that they can be resubmitted to the Central Committee for the issuance of party membership certificates.

Letters have been sent to inform them, but due to changes of address, they could not be delivered. Therefore, a list of names is specially published in the newspaper to notify them all to come to the department to complete the procedures from July 29th to August 7th, so that they can be resubmitted to the Central Committee for the issuance of certificates. Failure to do so by the deadline will be considered a forfeiture of rights. This is hereby announced.</p>

<h3>Freight Car Derailed at Longtan Station After Collision</h3>
<p>Repaired Immediately</p>
<p>At 10:25 AM yesterday, the 32nd freight train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway arrived in Longtan from Beijing. It was already 11:46 AM. However, there were 17 empty cars parked there, so the train was turned around to be towed to Shanghai. Nearby, there was a No. 11, 30-ton covered military car. When the freight train turned around, it collided violently with the covered car, causing eight wheels of the covered car to derail and crushing a worker to death. A telegram was immediately sent to Beijing, ordering craftsmen to come and repair it on the same day.</p>
<h3>Road Construction: Planning the Minhang-Pinghu Highway</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has recently approved a letter from the China Road Construction Association, stating that the association is entrusted with the important political task of promoting Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood, aiming to promote the early completion of roads throughout the country and the thorough reform of municipal administration. Over the past ten years, some work has been done. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the association's establishment. In addition to actively preparing for a road and municipal exhibition, which will collect and display the achievements of road and municipal construction in various provinces across the country, as well as planned books, charts, models, or newly invented road construction, maintenance, and transportation machinery and materials, the exhibition will also serve as a means of publicity and observation. Furthermore, the American consultant Fang Nan of the Road and Municipal Exhibition Preparatory Committee proposed that the section of highway from Minhang to Pinghu, which is an important route between Hangzhou and Shanghai, is currently under construction. Travel between Shanghai and Hangzhou relies solely on the railway, which cannot fully meet the needs of transportation. The association bears the important responsibility of promoting people's livelihood. This year, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary celebration, it is planned to raise funds to construct the section from Minhang to Pinghu as the association's tenth anniversary road, so that people can travel directly from Shanghai to Hangzhou by car, supplementing the railway transportation. After deliberation, it was decided to proceed accordingly. However, this matter is of great importance, and it would be difficult to achieve without a detailed plan and substantial funds. It is requested that your honorable county magistrate instruct the Construction Bureau to create a detailed plan for the road's route, mileage, and funding, and to promptly respond to the association so that it can send personnel to investigate, audit, and submit the budget to the Executive Committee for review and approval. This matter concerns the people's livelihood and public welfare of your honorable county. It is requested that you grant assistance and reply. County Magistrate Yan immediately instructed the Construction Bureau. Director Wu sent a letter to the counties of Pinghu, Jinshan, and Fengxian yesterday to conduct a nearby investigation and reply before further review.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Erecting Telephone Poles on the Beihui County Road</h3>
<p>Letter from the County Construction Bureau to the County Rectification Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Construction Bureau replied to the County Rectification Committee yesterday, stating that it had received the Committee's letter No. 46, indicating the Committee's decision to erect telephone poles along the Beihui Road, proceeding according to the route and avoiding encroachment on farmland to maintain agriculture. The Committee's concern for the people and protection of farmers is greatly appreciated. Upon investigation, the erection of telephone poles in the suburbs has always been carried out in a straight line, and when poles occasionally fall down, the principle of not obstructing road traffic is followed. Therefore, the poles on Beihui Road are not entirely on the road surface and occasionally enter farmland. This is because the poles only occupy a few square inches, and although there may be occasional trampling during construction, it will not hinder farming after completion. If the poles are re-transplanted according to the twists and turns of the road surface, the road surface construction on Beihui Road has not yet been completed, and planting poles here would hinder the rollers. Secondly, the curved route would be more expensive and would exceed the budget. Before the letter, instructions had already been given to the staff to be cautious and not damage farmland. A corresponding letter is hereby sent for your information.</p>
<h3>National Goods to Be Exhibited in Singapore</h3>
<p>The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Is Very Willing to Assist</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory United Association sent a letter to the Singapore Chinese General Chamber of Commerce proposing to hold a national goods mobile exhibition. Yesterday, the association received a reply from the Singapore Chinese General Chamber of Commerce (details omitted). At this time of expensive gold and cheap silver, the country's interests and rights are suffering huge losses. To save the situation, there is no better way than to vigorously promote national goods. This is a rare opportunity. Our association has long been advocating the promotion of national goods, and we are even more willing to help and guide your association's exhibition in the South. The size of the venue is up to you to choose, which is easy. However, we are deeply concerned about whether the preparation of the products of each factory is complete and whether your association's delegation to the South can become a reality.</p>
<h3>The Bean and Rice Industry Discusses Requesting the Social Bureau to Withdraw Its Order</h3>
<p>Pay Attention to the Points in the Cautionary Letter</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association convened a meeting of the same trade from the North and South markets at the Yimiao Association Hall. Chairman Ye Huijun, Rice Industry Association Chairman Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Jiang Zisheng, and other businesses, totaling 130, attended. The meeting was called to order at 3:00 PM by Chairman Ye Huijun, who stated that the reason for inviting the same trade to the meeting was that the Shanghai Social Bureau had issued an instruction with cautionary points for the trade to follow, along with eight regulations. The regulations were read out to the audience. Given the various relationships in our trade's operations, all those in the same trade were asked to discuss them. After deliberation, it was deemed that the cautionary points issued by the Social Bureau were difficult to implement and requested that the order be withdrawn. Reasons were prepared and submitted to the Social Bureau for withdrawal. The meeting then discussed the rice price issue and adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Yang Deqi, Member of the Private Property Supervision Committee, Passes Away; Ding Renke Appointed as Successor</p>
<p>The Shanghai County's original Private Property Supervision Committee consisted of two members from both the city and the county. Now, County Supervision Committee member Yang Deqi has passed away. The committee reported the vacancy to the County Government and requested the appointment of a successor. Yesterday, County Magistrate Yan issued a letter appointing local gentleman Ding Renke to fill Yang's vacancy, requesting that he attend the meeting and take office immediately. Separate letters were also sent to the City Finance Bureau and the County Finance Bureau for their information.</p>
<h3>Disaster of Bandits and Floods in Siyang</h3>
<p>Report Received by the Jisheng Society</p>
<p>The China Jisheng Society received a report from Zhang Pengzhu, the county magistrate of Siyang County, stating that according to reports from Chen Qi, the district chief of the First District, and Chen Tingju, the district chief of the Third District, Siyang is a barren and impoverished land with few residents who have savings. There have been years of disasters, and in recent years, soldiers and bandits have been rampant, causing people throughout the entire area to be displaced. This year, the disaster situation is most severe in the First and Third Districts. From spring to summer, bandits have been rampant, attacking towns and villages, killing more than a thousand people, and burning thousands of homes. Corpses are scattered across the fields, and beacons of fire fill the sky. Fathers, brothers, sons, and younger brothers have been kidnapped. When the soldiers and bandits open fire, the meat tickets are also affected. Suddenly, news of their survival turns to news of their death. The disaster caused by bandits is like this. During the spring, the lake water rose sharply, and the low-lying fields were completely submerged, while the higher ground was also hit by frost, making the autumn harvest a pipe dream. Then, from June 24th to 30th, continuous rain poured down, and the entire area was flooded, turning the high and low lands into swamps. The deep ones were more than ten feet deep, while the shallow ones were several feet deep, covering an area of dozens of miles. The grass and crops were destroyed, the walls collapsed, and there was no place to live or eat. People were crying from hunger and cold. The situation reported by the Second and Sixth Districts was roughly the same, with even more severe disaster conditions. The report was submitted to the county disaster relief meeting, requesting that the government, the provincial relief association, various charitable organizations, and your association allocate large sums of money to distribute to the disaster areas to save lives. The Jisheng Society found that the bandit disaster in Jinsuo Town, Siyang, was extremely severe. The society publicly appointed Director Li Yushu to go to the relief area with relief volunteers. However, due to the unrest caused by the bandits, Director Li and the relief volunteers encountered danger and were blocked from proceeding. Recently, Director Li reported that they were fortunate to have turned danger into safety and will proceed as soon as the situation in the area stabilizes. The Jisheng Society believes that the disaster situation in Jinsuo Town, Siyang, is so dire that the situation in other areas can be imagined. The society is unable to do what it wants due to financial constraints, but it can only save one life at a time and do its best.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South District Defense Corps</h3>
<p>Newly Formed Teams Begin Operations</p>
<p>The original twelve teams of the Shanghai South District Defense Corps have now been reorganized into nine teams. The respective captains and vice-captains have taken office and reported to the corps headquarters for record. The corps has now ordered the former teams to submit their seals and team signs to the corps, as the teams have already begun operations but the seals and names have not yet been changed. It is reported that the teams have successively complied with the order. The corps yesterday ordered teams one through nine to go to the corps to collect the seals and team signs for use to match their names. The seals of teams ten through twelve will be cut off separately and sent to the Municipal Government for record and cancellation.</p>
<h3>New Plan for Long-Distance Telephones in County Districts</h3>
<p>Talks by Director Wu of the Construction Bureau</p>
<p>Most of the construction of the North-Ma section of the long-distance telephone in the county has now been completed. The situation of being able to talk between Maqiao and Ruanxiang the other day has already been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. According to Director Wu of the County Construction Bureau, although the telephone project in the North-Ma section has been completed, each district in Puxi in the county still needs to continue to be erected to facilitate communication. The Bureau has conducted a fact-based review of the entire original plan for long-distance telephones in the county and has decided that it is not perfect and should be changed. The Bureau is currently planning the green area. After the original county area was divided from the Municipal Government, the town of Beiqiao was geographically the center of the existing county area. The telephone plan also follows this standard with the town as the central hub, so the North-Ma section was constructed first and then promoted. The original plan was to borrow the Shanghai-Minhang Road power line to reach Shanghai. Now, this route is a national line with vague transmission resistance, and the road use is very busy, and the transfer procedure is also very inconvenient. Therefore, it is proposed to change it. The current plan is to connect Changqiao, which borders the city, to Beiqiao through Xinzhen and other places, making it a straight line. After the call is made in the future, two branch lines will be added to Beiqiao to Minhang and Tangwan. After the completion of each line, it is planned to contact the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to sign an agreement so that the starting line of Changqiao can be connected to the bureau's line to directly reach Shanghai, and can also be transferred by the Shanghai Bureau to other places that have been connected, such as Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou and other places, without borrowing the Shanghai-Minhang Road line. After all of them are completed in the future, if the telephone calls to the counties are made by the Shanghai Bureau directly to the general hub of Beiqiao and transferred to each district, the communication in the four districts of Puxi will feel agile and convenient. However, the new plan is still in the draft, and it will be handled after it is approved by the Construction Department.</p>
<h3>Statistics of Each District Under the Jurisdiction of Shanghai County</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has now compiled a statistical table of each district under its jurisdiction, which is quite detailed and is specially recorded as follows: First District, District Chief Wu Jingqing, Location Minhang Town, Area 105 square miles and 4073, Population 22272, Households 5094, Number of Townships 3 Towns 35 Townships; Second District, Peng Liren, Tangwan Town, Area 118 square miles and 1063, Population 29168, Households 6771, Number of Townships 5 Towns 53 Townships; Third District, Yang Fulin, Beiqiao Town, Area 68 square miles and 8178, Population 15222, Households 3424, Number of Townships 2 Towns 32 Townships; Fourth District, Bi Huansanlin Town, Area 60 square miles and 6554, Population 21697, Households 4657, Number of Townships 4 Towns 27 Townships; Fifth District, Ren Yongkangchenxing Town, Area 46 square miles and 9163, Population 13783, Households 2929, Number of Townships 3 Towns 22 Townships; Sixth District, Wang Chengyaomaqiao Town, Area 58 square miles and 8421, Population 11907, Households 2756, Number of Townships 2 Towns 23 Townships.</p>
<h3>Extension of Lawyer Certificate Photo Attachment Period by Three Months</h3>
<p>The Judicial Administration Department of the National Government previously issued a general order to the Higher Courts of all provinces and the Shanghai Special District Higher Branch Court, instructing them to comply and publicize the regulations for lawyers' registration, which stipulated that photos should be submitted to the respective courts within three months for review. Now, the Judicial Administration Department, based on a telegram from Liang Renjie, the president of the Jiangxi Higher Court, stating that the three-month period has expired and the photos submitted by lawyers are not complete, and asking whether the period should be extended, has issued an order to the president of the court to approve an extension of three months to allow for continued processing. The Department has also issued instructions to the Higher Courts of all provinces and the Higher Branch Court of the Special District to instruct their subordinates and notify the Lawyers' Association to comply, as the matter is the same in all provinces and should be postponed by three months. Director Xu, after receiving Department Order No. 1417, has separately complied with the instructions and notified them, and yesterday made a special announcement to inform the public.</p>

<h3>Disease That Kills in One Hour</h3>
<p>A Mao Niang's Plague</p>
<p>Mrs. Ji, the wife of Mr. Ji (commonly known as A Mao Niang), who lives in the front building of No. 7 Fuxing Lane, Dongzilai Fire Street, French Concession, is now a movie theater inspector.

<h3>The End of the Aphrodisiac Case Sealing</h3>
<p>The Fine is Still Nine Hundred</p>
<p>Three Kinds of Medicines Returned</p>
<p>The Elisi Pharmacy on Hankou Road was reported by the patrolmen for selling aphrodisiacs. The first instance ruled that Chen Pengnian, the owner of the pharmacy, should be fined 900 yuan, the aphrodisiacs should be confiscated, and the business premises should be sealed. Chen was dissatisfied and hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to appeal. As a result, the fine remained 900 yuan, but three kinds of medicines, including the Bao Yu Lin Seed Medicine and contraceptive tablets, were returned. Chen is now requesting leniency on the grounds that the houses have been sealed for a long time and the losses are unbearable. He has hired lawyer Jiang to file a petition requesting the unsealing of the houses. It has been approved and officials were ordered to go to the pharmacy and legally unseal the gate yesterday afternoon. It is said that Chen is still planning to resume business.</p>
<h3>New Lawsuit Over Old Medicine Explosion</h3>
<p>Zhou Zhenqian's Sanhe Yong Copper Pot Shop, located at Liuwen Alley Entrance, Qinglian Street, Nine Acres, within the city, specializes in collecting scrap firearms and artillery shells for melting into copper, offering low prices and low costs. Last month, he suddenly acquired a medicine-filled artillery shell. While melting the copper, he didn't realize the medicine was still inside, causing a sudden explosion. At the time, two customers who were shopping were killed, and four were injured. Afterward, he didn't report the incident to the court for investigation. Therefore, the other day, the victims and the families of the deceased, including Lu Da'bei, Lu A'da, Tang Xilin, Yan Dengshan, Zhu De'san, Wang Sheng'lin, and Lu A'hui, filed a complaint with the District Court against Zhou Zhenqian. They also accused Ji Delin, the owner of the Ji Huoting Furniture Shop, because after the incident occurred, Ji alone used his influence to prevent reporting to the court for investigation, and the local authorities were also entirely managed by Ji. The prosecutor, after conducting a clear investigation, dispatched police the other day to summon both parties for questioning and investigation.</p>
<h3>Adopted Son Assaults Mother, Causing Injury</h3>
<p>Zhou Kunsheng has a Rogue Nature</p>
<p>In the Zhou family residence on Linqing Road, Yangshupu, a Zhou family made their fortune through business and accumulated tens of thousands of assets, considered well-off. After Zhou's death, his eldest son, Wenhua, and his third son also passed away successively. Wenhua left only a daughter named Jinmei, who is now twenty-one years old and still unmarried. The third son left a son named Fubao. The three generations have lived together and haven't divided their property. Recently, Jinmei suddenly fell in love with Zhou Kunsheng, a relative of the same clan, and her mother, Zhou Zhou-shi, tacitly approved of Kunsheng as her future son-in-law. However, her second uncle, Ziqi, and Fubao, the adopted son of Wenhua, both believed that Kunsheng was an unemployed rogue, so they disapproved of Zhou Zhou-shi and her daughter's actions, causing constant conflicts within the family. On the third of this month, during a division of property, a major argument erupted. Ziqi and Fubao, uncle and nephew, invited many people to brutally beat Zhou Zhou-shi and her daughter, causing them injuries all over their bodies. Afterward, the mother and daughter sought medical treatment and obtained injury certificates. They hired lawyer E Sen to file a criminal lawsuit against Ziqi and Fubao for assault. The other day, Judge Cheng Shangfeng of the Special District Court opened the trial and gathered the parties for questioning. First, Zhou Zhou-shi recounted the circumstances of the assault, stating that after the defendants, uncle and nephew, assaulted her and her daughter, they twisted her son-in-law, Zhou Kunsheng, into the Yangshupu police station, accusing him of possessing firearms and arson. The police station sent detectives to search her house, but they found nothing, and Kunsheng was released. She requested a strict investigation. Her daughter, Jinmei, also testified to the entire process. Since the judge said the plaintiffs were injured, he ordered the court clerk to take them to the forensic doctor for examination. The forensic report confirmed that the two did indeed have injuries. The defendant Zhou Ziqi claimed illness and did not attend, and was represented by lawyer Ye Kang. Zhou Fubao surrendered himself and confessed that Zhou Kunsheng's character was bad. On the third of this month, he sat beside the spirit tablet of his late father, Wenhua, drinking wine and saying to his father's spirit tablet, "Let's have a drink too!" He was almost crazy. After drinking, he lay down on the spirit tablet. His adopted mother and sister Jinmei ordered him to go to his room to sleep. Not only did he not listen, but he also beat his adopted mother and others. The neighbors all knew about this and came to mediate, taking his adopted mother and others out. Then, Kunsheng piled firewood in the house and poured kerosene on it, attempting to set fire. Seeing this, the neighbors believed that Kunsheng's actions endangered the surrounding neighborhood, so they twisted him into the police station. It was not just his uncle and nephew who made the decision. Furthermore, he had always beaten the plaintiff mother and daughter, and the neighbors could testify to this. Judge Cheng ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Mother and Daughter in Court</h3>
<p>Don't Let Down the Daughters of Noble Families</p>
<p>Sentenced to Seven Days, Suspended</p>
<p>Widow Wang Shen-shi, a local resident, resides at No. 19, Yong'an Lane, Bai'er Road, French Concession. The property there is owned by her, and she has considerable wealth. She has two daughters. The eldest daughter has already brought in Wang Defu as her son-in-law. The second daughter, Wang Jin-di, also known as Wang Peiqin, is twenty years old this year and still unmarried, teaching at a certain school. Peiqin and her mother are in a dispute over marriage matters. Her mother, Shen-shi, hired lawyer Yan Dike to sue Peiqin for the crime of assaulting and insulting her parents in the French Court. The trial opened the other day. First, the plaintiff, Wang Shen-shi, stated that her daughter Peiqin's father died a few months after her birth. She raised her, sent her to school, and after graduation, she taught at a certain school. In April of this year, she entrusted someone to act as a matchmaker at home to marry her to a certain family. After she found out that this family already had a wife, she refused. Unexpectedly, her daughter became angry and knocked her to the ground. She then ran into the kitchen and held a knife, intending to kill her. Fortunately, her younger brother, the daughter's maternal uncle, saw this and stepped forward to take the knife away, preventing the knife wound. Afterward, the rebellious daughter went out in anger and returned home a month later. At home, she often made things difficult for her. Furthermore, last year, the rebellious daughter borrowed a handgun from the gatekeeper to kill a woman. If this continues, she will inevitably suffer from her harm. Therefore, she was forced to file a lawsuit for investigation. Next, the lawyer Yan Dike, representing her, said that the plaintiff treated her daughter with utmost love and affection. Peiqin entered school at the age of seven and has been studying for thirteen years, spending a considerable amount of money. Unexpectedly, Peiqin not only has no filial piety but also wants to borrow a gun to kill her mother, holding a knife to commit violence, and knocking her own mother to the ground, and destroying all the items in the house. All kinds of rebellious acts are difficult to describe. The origin of this case is that Peiqin wants to marry a certain person, but her mother discovered that this person already has a wife and children. The plaintiff absolutely refused out of love for her daughter. Who knew that the defendant would not understand her mother's good intentions and instead assaulted and insulted her parents, and dared to go out for months without returning? Know that the defendant is a daughter of a noble family. How can she often stay outside? Is this the kind of behavior that a daughter should do? Now, the plaintiff believes that her daughter is already a teacher at a certain school and can support herself outside. She asks for an investigation and orders the defendant not to return to her mother's house to avoid future troubles. As for the family property, the plaintiff will naturally dispose of it when she is on her deathbed. The defendant, Wang Peiqin, also hired lawyer Pu Lai Mei to defend her, saying that this case is entirely a family quarrel. The origin is that her sister and brother-in-law intended to swallow the family property, so they provoked the plaintiff to make things difficult for the defendant. The plaintiff's lawyer's claim that she borrowed a gun to plot and held a knife to commit violence is completely false, and there is no basis for the criminal accusation. As for the plaintiff's request that the defendant find another life outside, the defendant is a weak woman. Where can she live? She asks for understanding. Wang Peiqin said that it was not because of marriage matters, but because her sister and brother-in-law conspired to seize the family property and instigated her mother to file a lawsuit. Next, the plaintiff's witness, Sun Guanghua, said that he worked as a gatekeeper in the plaintiff's residence. The defendant, Miss Wang, did indeed borrow a handgun from him. At that time, he refused for fear of causing death. Furthermore, witness Shen Xinquan said that when the defendant's niece quarreled with her mother, she did indeed go to the kitchen and hold a knife to commit violence. Fortunately, he took it away before it caused trouble. Then, the lawyers of both parties debated with each other. Judge Zhu Qi announced the end of the debate and said to the defendant, "Your mother only has two daughters, both of whom are her own. There is absolutely no favoritism. From now on, you should do your best to be filial and not be rebellious again." He sentenced Wang Peiqin to seven days, suspended for six months, and ordered the plaintiff to take her back for supervision.</p>

<h3>Son-in-Law and Mother-in-Law Fight</h3>
<p>Shen Xiao-si Fears Losing His Wife</p>
<p>Deng Guo-shi, an elderly woman from Gaoyou, residing in a thatched house at No. 44, Taiyang Temple Road, Zhabei, yesterday twisted her son-in-law, Shen Xiao-si, and filed a complaint with the Fourth District Police Station, saying, "My daughter married the defendant. I have always treated him very well. Unexpectedly, he suddenly came to my place today and, without asking the reason, first destroyed all the items in my room and then twisted me and beat me severely, causing internal injuries. I request a strict investigation." Shen Xiao-si confessed that he was twenty years old and lived at No. 7, Jiu'an Lane, Jiaotong Road, and worked as a leather craftsman. The plaintiff is his mother-in-law. Recently, he heard that she wanted to instigate his daughter to divorce him, but he is very poor and it is not easy to marry a wife. If this is true, he will lose both his wife and his property. How can he bear to live in this world? So he went to fight with her, not daring to beat his elders. He asked for leniency. The court ruled that Deng Guo-shi's injuries were not light and should be taken to the police station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Two Nephews Beat an Aunt</h3>
<p>Released with Leniency, Re-offense Permitted for Arrest</p>
<p>Chi Li-shi, a woman residing at Li's residence, Fukaisen Road, French New Concession, reported to the French police the other day that her nephews, Li Baojin and Baoxin, beat her for no reason, causing her dissatisfaction and requesting an investigation. The police chief approved and ordered detectives to arrest the two Li brothers. The other day, they were sent to the French court for investigation. The plaintiff, Chi Li-shi, complained about the previous situation. Li Baojin and Baoxin confessed together that their aunt had always been in Tianjin and was now returning home. The other day, they and others advised her not to leave Shanghai again, leading to an argument. They dared not beat her. Judge Zhu ruled that the two defendants be released with leniency and ordered that they not act unreasonably again in the future. If they re-offend, they should be arrested and investigated without fail.</p>
<h3>One Jiang-shi in the Zhu Family</h3>
<p>Sister-in-Law Endured Suffering</p>
<p>Zhu Jinbang (30 years old), from Yangzhou, has two younger brothers, Jinbao and Jinlong, each married. The three brothers have not yet divided their property and live together at No. 259, Nanlin Lane, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei. Jinbang earns more each month than Jinbao and Jinlong. The daily food and other expenses are inevitably higher for Jinbang than for his two younger brothers. Jinbang's wife, Jiang-shi, is very unhappy about this and often urges her husband to establish separate households, but Jinbang values brotherhood and ignores her. Seeing that her husband and Jinbao's wife, Dai-shi, are very close, Jiang-shi suspects that her husband is having an affair with her sister-in-law and makes disrespectful remarks. The sisters-in-law often quarrel. Jinbao and others are very angry. The other day, while her brother Jinbang was out, they and his wife Dai-shi locked their sister-in-law Jiang-shi in a room and beat her severely, biting her right arm and little finger. The next day, the third brother, Jinlong, resented his sister-in-law for instigating a division of property and slandering their brothers' reputation, so he cut Jiang-shi's head with a knife. Jiang-shi then filed a complaint with the First Branch of the Fourth District Police Station. Director Yao learned of the previous situation and sent police to summon Jinbao, Jinlong, and Dai-shi, but they were not found. Her husband, Jinbang, was summoned and confessed that his wife was indeed incompatible and that the injuries to her head and other places were caused by her falling. Director Yao believed that the confession was strange and that there must be other circumstances. Yesterday, he reported the case to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for verification.</p>
<h3>Wu Renshou Insistently Seeks Divorce</h3>
<p>Li Lianlian Suffers All Kinds of Hardships</p>
<p>Wu Renshou, from Anhui, previously worked as an assistant in the Sanitation Section of the Songhu Police Department and has been unemployed for many years. He currently resides at No. 2, Lane 107, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. His wife, Wu Li-shi (also known as Li Lianlian), is thirty-two years old (Wu's second wife). She has been married for twelve years and has one son and one daughter. However, she is addicted to smoking opium. Her husband repeatedly advised her to quit, but she pretended to have quit on the surface. In reality, she often took advantage of opportunities to sneak out to the Swallow's Nest to indulge in her opium addiction. Therefore, her husband hated her to the core and reported her. The police arrested her and sent her to the District Court for questioning. Her confession was true. On July 7th of this year, she was sentenced to two months of imprisonment and fined 60 yuan, and sent to the Second Prison in Caohejing for execution. Now, Wu Renshou, believing that his wife Li Lianlian is incorrigible and that it is difficult to live together, has filed a personal lawsuit with the Civil Court of the court requesting a divorce. The other day, Judge Zhang Jinjian opened the trial and sent an official to the Second Prison to bring Li Lianlian to testify. The plaintiff, Wu Renshou, testified that he was fifty-one years old and from Anhui. He had previously worked in the police force. (Question) When did you get married? (Answer) On June 19th of the Republic of China Year 7, Zhang and Chen acted as matchmakers to marry Li Lianlian as his second wife. (Question) What is your reason for requesting a divorce? (Answer) She does not observe the rules of wifely conduct and smokes opium. (1) She often makes excuses to go out to the Swallow's Nest to smoke. (2) She secretly pawns the clothes in the house to pay for her opium smoking. (3) She declared that she would kill me. With these points, a divorce is a must. (Question) Do you have children? (Answer) Yes, one son and one daughter. (Question) When did she start smoking? (Answer) She started smoking in the Republic of China Year 11. The plaintiff then presented a stack of pawn tickets to the court for inspection and stated that these pawn tickets were all secretly pawned by her. In this situation, it is impossible to reconcile. He requests permission to grant a divorce. Next, the defendant, Li Lianlian, testified that she was thirty-two years old and from Changshu. (Question) Did you marry the plaintiff as his second wife? (Answer) He had not previously married a woman in a formal wedding ceremony. (Question) Do you smoke opium? (Answer) I smoke a little, but I am not addicted. (Question) How long have you been smoking? (Answer) About a year. (Question) What do you think about the plaintiff wanting a divorce? (Answer) I do not want a divorce. Now I am willing to quit smoking and never smoke again. Moreover, I have already given birth to children. If I smoke again, I am willing to be punished for life. The judge tried to mediate in court and said to the plaintiff, "After the defendant's sentence expires and she is released from prison, order her to be determined to quit opium. Moreover, the defendant has already given birth to children. You have been husband and wife for many years and have only committed a smoking mistake. To divorce her would be excessive. If she can quit smoking, she is still a good person. It is better not to divorce." The defendant interjected, "I am willing to repent. I have suffered a lot of hardships now and I am willing to follow my husband's instructions and start anew. I beg for forgiveness for my past mistakes." She begged the plaintiff bitterly, and her appearance was quite pitiful. However, the plaintiff turned his head and refused to agree to a divorce. The judge then asked Prosecutor Liu Pingfan to come to court and express his opinion, stating that the main reason for the plaintiff's request for a divorce was that the defendant smoked opium, but smoking can also be quit. As for the plaintiff's claim that the defendant wanted to kill him, there is no sufficient evidence. The plaintiff's lawsuit has no merit and should be rejected. The judge then announced that the debate in this case was over and scheduled the verdict for 1:00 PM on the 30th of this month. The defendant, Li Lianlian, was ordered to be sent to the Second Prison for the execution of the sentence.</p>

<h3>Zhu Xilin Commits Suicide but Fails</h3>

<p>Method: Taking Tranquilizer Water</p>
<p>The Qiantai Hotel on Tianjin Road received a young man from Huzhou on the afternoon of the 25th of this month, residing in room number 16. He claimed to be named Zhu Xilin and was 22 years old. Suddenly, Zhu Chengxiang, a fellow villager, came to visit him yesterday morning. However, after calling for a long time outside the door, there was no response. The tea boy pried open the door and found Zhu Xilin lying stiffly on the bed, barely breathing. Knowing that he had taken poison, they sent him to the Baolong Hospital on Baker Road for treatment. Fortunately, his life was not in danger. The poison he had taken was examined by the doctor and found to be tranquilizer pills. According to Zhu Xilin's fellow villager, he went to visit Zhu because he had received Zhu's suicide note. As for the reason for Zhu's suicide, it was nothing more than economic pressure. Zhu came to Shanghai before the new year to study at a certain money shop and was burdened by a friend's loan. He left Shanghai and returned home. This time, he came to Shanghai from Huzhou, originally intending to open his own shop, but his plan failed and he suffered other stimuli, suddenly developing a pessimistic view of life. Before taking the medicine, Zhu wrote two letters, one to his uncle and one to his aunt, describing the above reasons for suicide.</p>

His parents are both alive and well at home, and he is married to Gao-shi, with whom he has a loving relationship. Zhang usually wears a Western suit and has a graceful demeanor, but he is extremely stubborn. Whenever things don't go his way, he quarrels with his parents, and his resentment accumulates, strengthening his desire to die. In his daily conversations, he often expresses his intention to throw himself into the Pu River or go out to sea to commit suicide. His wife took it as an occasional joke and dismissed it with a smile. Unexpectedly, when Zhang went to work at the depot the other day, he made a startling statement, demanding to resign. The depot, unaware of the change, approved his request and calculated his salary of 28 yuan. Zhang lingered at the depot until 3:00 PM before leaving a pair of yellow shorts and a pair of black leather shoes at the depot, asking his colleague Mr. Lu to keep them temporarily and give them to his wife when she came to collect them. After speaking, he left without saying goodbye. At first, his family was unaware. When he did not return one night, his wife Gao-shi rushed to the depot to inquire yesterday morning, but he had long since disappeared without a trace. Gao-shi had no choice but to take the shorts and leather shoes home and inform her in-laws. They immediately sent out scouts to search everywhere, but there was still no information, and there was no trace of him at the homes of distant and close relatives and friends. Gao-shi, believing that her husband had suicidal thoughts, was convinced that he had taken this path. She only regretted not paying attention and monitoring him earlier, leading to this change. Fearing that he had died in the Pu River and that his body would be unfindable, she went to the Water Police Station in the afternoon to request the police to pay attention.</p>

Abbot Zhifa of Jing'an Temple, along with Wang Hancheng, Gong Yifei, Xu Wenyuan, and others, standing committee members of the former Jing'an Temple Businessmen's Association, recognized that the summer season is a time when epidemics are rampant and illnesses abound. Impoverished patients have no means to seek medical treatment and can only await death helplessly. Therefore, they specially organized the Jing'an Temporary Hospital within the temple. Zhifa was publicly elected as the director, Gong Yifei as the director of general affairs, and Jiang Zhongqiu as the director of medical affairs. More than ten Chinese and Western doctors, including Chen Yusheng, Xu Huanren, Yu Chuhui, and Zhu Lingqing, were hired to visit the hospital daily for diagnosis and medication, and to provide free vaccinations to help the poor and sick. The hospital opened yesterday, and more than one hundred people sought treatment. However, the hospital's finances are insufficient, and they deeply hope that philanthropists from all walks of life will enthusiastically sponsor them.</p>
<h3>Bloodshed as a Result of Gambling</h3>
<p>Gu Shanfu Cuts Yang Rulang with a Knife</p>
<p>Yang Rulang, a 25-year-old man from Haimen who lived on the upper floor of a crossing building in Nanlin Lane, Haining Road, worked as a cart puller. Last night, he was playing the "shaheng" game at home when Gu Shanfu, a fellow villager who sells watermelons, got into an argument over dealing cards. Gu grabbed a watermelon knife and slashed Yang's head once, left shoulder once, and finger once, for a total of three cuts. Blood flowed profusely. When Police Constable No. 1606 from the Huishi Police Station arrived after hearing the news, the assailant had already fled. The injured Yang was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. After reporting the matter to the police chief, they began searching for the assailant to bring him to justice.</p>

<h3>Invention of Protective Agent for Gramophones and Records</h3>
<p>When a gramophone is used for a long time, it inevitably experiences sluggish rotation or a rattling sound inside. Old records often produce hissing sounds, uneven speed, and loss of sound quality. These are all due to the lack of a chemical oil. A solution should be sought urgently. Now, Safe Company at No. 2136 Weian Lane, Haining Road, has specially used scientific methods to produce "Sheep Brand" gramophone and record oil (referred to as "Sheep Brand Oil"). A drop of this oil into the gramophone will immediately make it rotate freely without stagnation or damage. Applying it to records that have developed hissing sounds or sound loss can eliminate dust and restore the original sound like a new record. It is an essential item for those who own gramophones and records. It is now on sale for only 60 cents per bottle. All gramophone companies in the city sell it. To benefit customers, the company offers free postage for those who purchase directly from them and invites distributors from various cities.</p>

<p>The Zhufeng Enamel Factory Workers' Union Corrects the Factory Manager Tong Jitong's Erroneous Business Report to Shareholders: To the Respected Shareholders, upon reading the factory's business report for the 18th year, the section describing the labor unrest is completely inconsistent with the facts. We fear that you may not understand the truth and be deceived by Manager Tong, leading to misunderstandings or even resentment and animosity towards the union and workers. This union must make a correction. Furthermore, Manager Tong bears the responsibility for instigating, expanding, and prolonging the labor unrest last year, which was influenced by his personal emotions and affected the interests of all shareholders. This inside story must be disclosed based on the facts. For easy comparison, we will describe it in sections below: (1) The original text states, "At the same time, the factory aims to regulate the labor and leisure of workers (omitted)... but the loss has reached more than 500 taels." According to the usual practice at the time, the night shift in the enamel department worked from 6:00 PM to 3:00 AM the next morning, resting before leaving the factory at 6:00 AM. Therefore, the night shift workers, except for a few who stayed to take care of the stove, would rest briefly after 3:00 AM. However, on May 29th of last year, the factory's manufacturing department suddenly changed the hours, making the night shift's work and break times the same as the day shift. As a result, the night shift workers felt exhausted and feared accidents. They came to the union to express their grievances. The union repeatedly sent personnel to the manufacturing department to request the original system be maintained to protect the workers' lives, but they were rejected. The workers had no choice but to declare that they would give up their obligation to add coal during the one-hour break from 12:00 AM to 1:00 AM, causing the stove to extinguish. The factory authorities immediately accused them of negligence, causing losses to the factory. Given these reasons and results, who should be blamed? Changing the old rules and oppressing the workers is already unjust, let alone falsely accusing them. This should be noted. (2) The original text states, "Since the shareholders' meeting held on July 7th (omitted)... it was finally decided that all workers would be allowed to resume work uniformly on August 10th." Enamel work is related to heat, so there is a summer vacation. The work of other departments is related to the enamel department, so workers in various departments proposed a request for a summer vacation. The union sent a letter to the manager stating everything, but it was rejected. At that time, it was so hot that they could no longer work, and the factory made no indication. At the meeting, it was decided to announce a unanimous vacation. Before implementation, the manager was also notified by letter, but there was no reply, leading to the dispute. The union proposed that the enamel department take turns resting, while other departments reduce hours and give weekly days off, but the manager ignored it and refused to negotiate, leading to this dispute. As for the Social Bureau's reprimand of Qiu Liangshan and others, it is even more unfounded. Now the manager reports this without considering his own unreasonableness. This should be noted. (3) The original text states, "On August 10th, when the workers came to the factory to sign employment contracts (omitted)... the order was chaotic." After the summer vacation dispute was mediated and settled by the Social Bureau, the workers signed employment contracts when they returned to the factory. However, the manager created additional problems by adding employment request forms and forcing them to put fingerprints, and stipulating that the employment period was only one year, leading to opposition from most of the workers. The union sent personnel to request changes and petitioned the Social Bureau to retain the working hours, wages, quotas, and employment period, and to cancel the forced fingerprints and employment request forms. The Social Bureau approved the former and corrected the latter. However, the manager acted against the spirit of the agreement. The union members could no longer bear it and signed a deceitful and oppressive petition to awaken the manager. However, things went against their wishes. Not only did he not admit his mistake, but he dismissed the union executive committee members Lou, Qiu, Yan, Xia, Song, Zhang, and others on the pretext of inducing and deceiving. He secretly agreed to contract terms in exchange for three yuan. At the same time, he hosted a banquet for gangsters in the Hongyun Restaurant in the French Concession, paying them three dollars each to instigate them to beat the union representatives, place advertisements under false names, have workers withdraw from the union, rent hotels, and secretly order labor spies to organize a new union, posting slogans falsely accusing the union executive committee members. Even when the Social Bureau ordered Lou and others to resume work and sent police escorts into the factory and convened mediation, he refused to comply, causing the labor unrest to prolong. How can all these offenses be covered up? This should be noted. (4) The original text states, "Since the enamel department workers engaged in two work slowdowns (omitted)... it gradually returned to its original state." Since August, the manager has used workers to destroy the union, so that a few workers have been favored by the manager and have become unscrupulous. General staff also have no right to manage them. The manager is the one who started all this and should be accountable and not put the blame on the union. This should be noted. In summary of the four points above, the loss of more than 10,000 taels from last year's labor unrest, whether it was caused by the workers or suffered by the manager, is very clear and cannot be denied. For the sake of its own interests and the interests of the shareholders, the union has to make a correction based on the actual situation. We hope for clear judgment. Respectfully, July 26th of the 19th year.</p>
<p>The Su-Ning Tea and Food Workers' Union held its second executive meeting at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. Chairman Zhang Zhigao discussed: (1) Accountant Dai Deyuan submitted a request to resign due to a lack of time to handle both positions. It was decided to appoint Dai Shigui as his successor and Wang Houfu as the bookkeeper. (2) As the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, how should temporary non-member employees from other places hired by various stores be handled? It was decided to continue following the old rules and require them to obtain a temporary registration certificate to be allowed to work. (3) The Tianlu Branch of Zhejiang Road is deducting workers' wages for bereavement leave. Should negotiations be requested? It was decided to hand it over to the mediation department for handling and reconsideration. (4) The mediator Gong Zhijian proposed to resign. Should his request be approved? It was decided to unanimously persuade him to stay and send representatives to urge him. (5, 6, 7, 8) Omitted. (9) Scheduled standing committee duties. It was decided that Zhang Zhigao on the 1st and 6th, Zhu Helian on the 2nd and 7th, Zhu Youkai on the 3rd and 8th, Dai Shize on the 4th and 9th, and Wang Chaoran on the 5th and 10th. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>The Luye Workers' Union held its fifth executive committee meeting the day before yesterday. Chairman Gao Changgui resolved the following: (1) The Xixian Guild Hall refused to hand over [funds or materials] and secretly moved items. How should this be handled? It was resolved to submit a request to the Municipal Party Department for handling. (2) The accounts of the thick donation received by the Xixian Guild Hall have not been made public, and hoarding is suspected. How should this be handled? It was resolved to submit a request to the Municipal Party Department to send personnel to investigate and withdraw the charge. (3) The date of the union's regular meeting should be scheduled. It was resolved that the executive committee will meet every Sunday, and the standing committee will meet every Tuesday and Friday. (4) The French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' strike has expanded and there is no hope of resolution. The union should express its support to urge the employer to be aware. It was resolved to issue a declaration of support.</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Cleaning Workers' Union held its sixth reelection general meeting at 2:00 PM on the 26th. More than 160 members attended. Tang Zhengqiao was publicly elected as the chairman. The chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting and the process. The election began, and Chen Yousong, Tang Zhengqiao, Wang Asan, Liu Shaozhang, Wang Runzhi, and five others were elected as executive committee members, and Hou Huasheng and Xu Rongbang were elected as alternate members. They were sworn in and took office. It was decided to hold the first executive committee meeting at the union hall in Qinglong Bridge at 3:00 PM on the 27th to allocate duties and discuss important cases. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>The Huazhuang Binding Industry Zhabei District Workers' Union held an emergency meeting the day before yesterday. Chairman Chen Zhaoqing convened the meeting as usual. The chairman first reported, and then resolved important cases: (1) Wang and Tang opened bookstores and excessively recruited apprentices. The Sixth District Party Department had transferred the case to the Social Bureau for investigation and prohibition, but they continued to operate as before, offending the public anger of 800 members of the union. Should a direct negotiation be conducted with them? It was decided to notify all members to tolerate it temporarily and request the Social Bureau to strictly prohibit it again. (2) The organization department proposed that a labor dispute occurred in the Tangpinji Binding Workshop. How should it be handled? It was decided to send Comrade Chen Zhaoqing to attend the mediation. (3) Should the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' strike be supported? It was decided to issue a declaration: Dear French Concession Water and Electricity Workers and all Shanghai Workers, at this time of soaring prices and inflation, the most humble workers with the lowest wages cannot maintain their livelihood. It is imperative to request employers to increase wages, which is a legitimate demand. However, employers not only did not sincerely accept it, but also used imperialist behavior and cruel means to harm our dear workers. Even bullets swept across the road on Marlborough Road, and innocent workers' flesh and blood flew. How can this be tolerated? Our union deeply sympathizes and pledges to stand as a backing for all workers, bleeding together. We sincerely hope that water and electricity workers and all Shanghai workers will act quickly and go all out. By persevering and fighting together, victory is inevitable. We hereby declare.</p>
<p>The Postal Workers' Union Solemnly Declares Regarding the North China Postal Workers' Slowdown: The North China Postal Workers' Union, feeling the pain of soaring prices and inflation, was forced to request the authorities to increase postal workers' salaries and temporary subsidies (i.e., rice subsidies). However, their requests were denied by the authorities. Past experiences have taught us that the deep pain of North China postal workers has never received any consideration from the postal authorities. They have only redoubled their efforts to improve the methods of exploitation. Therefore, the treatment we receive only seems to be getting worse, and the burden of life is becoming heavier day by day. So, given this situation, what other choice do we have besides the announcement of a work slowdown by the North China Postal Workers' Union? However, inconvenience to society under the North China postal workers' slowdown is unavoidable. But the postal authorities are responsible for creating such negative consequences. Therefore, we sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will provide sympathy and assistance to the North China postal workers and urge the postal authorities to bear full responsibility for this unfortunate work slowdown and provide a satisfactory solution to the demands raised by the North China postal workers. We believe that the demands of the North China Postal Workers' Union are extremely legitimate and urgent. In reality, the soaring prices are causing wages to fall, and lower-level postal workers are constantly groaning in painful lives. Our union has already submitted a request to the authorities to increase salaries by one-eighth for gold and silver exchange subsidies, but we have not yet received a response from the authorities. The demands of the North China Postal Workers' Union are the same as those of our union in principle, and they also take into account the postal bureau's ability to deduct expenses. We are determined to fight to the death for this demand. If the authorities consider the livelihood of the hardworking postal workers, they will not refuse us rice subsidies (what is called temporary subsidies in Shanghai). It is strange that the price of rice is more expensive in North China than in Shanghai, but the authorities are still rejecting the five-yuan rice subsidies requested by the North China postal workers. We simply don't understand why those who have served for more than one year and are in full position as porter in the same management of North China Postal Bureau would have such a difference in treatment, which are now implemented in Shanghai. In fact, it is an example of how the authorities are always thinking of ways to exploit workers. For the sake of humanity, we oppose the authorities' use of similar exploitation tactics in various places. In conclusion, we believe that the slowdown of the North China postal workers is the result of the authorities' numbness. Unless the postal workers' pain is completely alleviated, they will spare no sacrifice for the sake of their own future and their survival. Our union has already requested the authorities to provide a satisfactory solution to the North China slowdown within five days. Otherwise, for the sake of the postal workers' interests, our union is determined to lead all workers to make further expressions. Respectfully, July 24th.</p>

<h3>Davis Cup Second Day Finals: France Wins Again in Doubles</h3>
<p>France's Cochet and Borotra Defeat (USA)'s Allison and Van Ryn 3-1 – French President Attends the Match – France Poised to Regain Hegemony</p>
<p>(Paris Dispatch, 26th) Today, at the Davis Cup, the United States and France held their doubles match. After each winning a singles match yesterday, those who love tennis gathered to witness the result, as its victory or defeat is related to whether the United States or France will hold the position of hegemony.</p>
<h3>Prediction of the Championship</h3>
<p>The seats in the Artio Stadium were completely filled with spectators. French President Doumergue personally came to the battlefield to encourage the troops. As a result of the battle, France's Cochet and Borotra defeated the US's Allison and Van Ryn by a score of 3 to 1. In the three-day total, France led with a score of two to one. The last two singles matches were France's Cochet against the US's Tilden and France's Borotra against the US's George Lott. Predicting the outcome, the US must win two consecutive matches to win the championship. However, in reality, both are not opponents of France. At best, each side will win one match. Therefore, France's grip of hegemony is within sight, and it does not seem difficult to discuss now.</p>
<h3>Progress of the Doubles Match</h3>
<p>The skills of France's Cochet were flawless and could be described as the most successful of his life. His position was appropriate, his energy abundant, and it was breathtaking to watch. His partner Borotra also assisted with wonderful baseline shots, heavily oppressing the US team, which seemed lifeless. France won the first and second sets by scores of six to three and seven to five. In the third set, the US team had a special performance, which was praised by the surrounding audience. Sure enough, they won back one set with a score of six to one. In the fourth set, France reignited and was exceptionally active, regaining its vigor for the final push.</p>
<h3>The French Players who Won the Doubles (Right) Cochet (Left) Borotra</h3>
<p>I</p>
<p>I</p>
<h3>The American Players who Lost the Doubles (Right) Allison (Left) Van Ryn</h3>
<p>I</p>
<p>Soon they defeated the US with a score of six to two.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Victory and Defeat</h3>
<p>France's victory was due to their excellent skill, but more importantly, their rich experience. The two were paired like left and right hands, advancing and retreating in an orderly manner, with connected attacks and defenses. The two players on the US team were newcomers with strong physical strength and were good at long battles. However, they are prone to the illness of anxiety due to being young and impulsive. The US team was also unable to avoid this, and therefore often committed suicidal acts. The biggest mistake was that the two players on the US team both concentrated on the steady Cochet, while ignoring Borotra, one of the weaknesses of the French team. The battle plan was completely wrong, and the failure was their own fault.</p>
<h3>Heddon's Retrospective</h3>
<p>Looking back on the Heddon War of a month ago, it was quite interesting. At that time, the US's Allison had defeated France's Cochet, and France's Borotra had defeated George Lott. This time, Borotra and George Lott will meet again at the Davis Cup. It is unknown whether the French team will be able to maintain its victory, or whether the Americans will reverse the situation. Also, at that time, the Cochet-Borotra combination was defeated by the American Taug and Lott in the semi-final. However, in the final, the Americans Allison and Van Ryn lost to the American Taug and Lott by a score of 6-3, 6-3, 6-2, allowing them to win the championship. In this Davis Cup final, Cochet and Borotra were in the position of repeat losers, and their victory is worth remembering.</p>
<h3>The Fourth World Student Games Opening on August 1st</h3>
<p>A Total of Ninety Countries Participating – More Than a Thousand Male and Female Athletes</p>
<p>The fourth World Student Games has been scheduled to be held in Darmstadt, Germany, starting on August 1st. The competition period is ten days, from August 1st to 10th. A total of ninety countries have registered to participate, including all European countries, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, and South Africa. All regulations and competition items are in accordance with the World Games, including track and field, swimming, rowing, fencing, soccer, and tennis.</p>
<h3>International Track and Field Athletes</h3>
<p>The number of registered athletes totals over one thousand, with track and field athletes being the most numerous, accounting for 244 individuals, approximately one-fifth of the total. Germany has the largest contingent with fifty athletes, followed by France with thirty. Italy ranks third with twenty-five, and Japan fourth with fifteen. The American athletes are attracting the most attention because although their numbers are small, their individual strength and performance surpass those of others.</p>
<h3>Japan's Missed Opportunity</h3>
<p>Although Japan only has fifteen athletes participating this time, they will undoubtedly occupy a significant position in the games. After the Far Eastern Games, their achievements shocked the world, with both Mikio Oda being world-class athletes. Many other countries also have world-class athletes, so breaking world records at this event is not impossible. Japan's biggest regret is the rejection of Keio University athletes' participation in the European tour. The reason is the punishment Keio received before the Far Eastern Games; otherwise, their strength would have been even more formidable. Keio's Takada in the shot put and Tsuda in the 1500 meters both have performances close to world records and are hopeful of winning medals.</p>
<h3>Slight Differences in Track and Field Events</h3>
<p>The competition events all follow the World Games, but in track and field, it was decided to cancel the 10,000 meters, 1,000 meters, and triple jump. For the women's division, the 800-meter long-distance run, which many doubted, was canceled and replaced with the 80-meter hurdles, adding long jump and javelin.</p>
<h3>Eight Nations Compete in Football</h3>
<p>Eight countries are participating in football: Germany, France, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Luxembourg, and Yugoslavia. Among them, Hungary and Italy are the strongest teams, and it is predicted that the final will be between these two teams. Only Germany and France have joined rugby. Romania is undecided, so this item will only be a demonstration game. It is a pity that our country's football team did not have enough time; otherwise, they could have participated in a match.</p>

<p>Reversed Adversity, Bohua Triumphs: Fan Bohua and Yu Debiao faced off at six o'clock. Fan, a postal worker, is meticulous and began practicing tennis last summer, making rapid progress. His forehand and backhand returns are steady, just like his personality. Yu is a newcomer this year, his shots are direct and powerful, sometimes the ball enters the opponent's territory irresistibly, sometimes it flies wide, resulting in wasted effort. Mr. Fan reversed the adversity, maintained a calm demeanor, and triumphed in a short period, with a score of 6-4, 6-1. Referee: Zhang Longhai.</p>
<p>Old Monk's Bitter Cultivation, Later Attainment: Huang Jidang has won all his matches in the competition group, with great hope of winning the title. His strange tactics are quite amusing. As a tall and upright person, he often presses down on low balls from above. If he cannot reach them, he bends his knees to accommodate, his posture resembling an old monk hitting a wooden fish. His opponent, Liu Junhua, put in extra effort in this match. Although he was at a disadvantage in the first set, he managed to surprise and win the second set. In the first half of the third set, Mr. Liu also took an aggressive stance, threatening to shake Mr. Huang's title, but in the end, victory still belonged to Mr. Huang. People say that an old monk's bitter cultivation eventually leads to attainment. Score: 6-1, 5-7, 6-4. Referee: Wang Wuchen.</p>
<p>Wiping Sweat and Quenching Thirst, Xiaoqin Achieves Success: Zhang Xiaoqin, who works at the Social Bureau, has considerable skill in tennis. It's a pity she lacks endurance. In the first set against Fu Zhuhua, she played well and won 6-1. In the second set, she gradually became exhausted mid-way. Fortunately, a friend gave her some sweets and a towel to quench her thirst and wipe away sweat, and her spirits were revived. She won again 6-3. Referee: Zhang Longhai.</p>
<p>Eating Tender Tofu, Ziang is Ruthless: Xiao Ziang is a ruthless general in the Net Group, winning every battle. This time, facing Liu Junheng, he was even more ruthless. Mr. Liu's skills are not weak, but recently he has been limited by his work and has neglected practice. He suffered a 6-1 defeat in the first set. In the second set, Mr. Xiao took advantage of the victory and pursued relentlessly, completing six games as easily as eating tender tofu. Referee: Yin Guanxiong.</p>
<p>Sweating Profusely, Li Yue Defeated: Zhu Xiaozhong has a large frame, powerful smashes. Li Yue is skilled in fist techniques and good at running, and his responses are very resourceful. When the two met, they each used their strengths and held each other at bay. Zhu won the first set 7-5. Li retaliated with 6-3 in the second set. In the third set, Mr. Li sweated profusely and was exhausted from running. In the end, victory still belonged to Mr. Zhu. Score: 6-3. Referee: Li Wenlan.</p>
<p>Two Dashing Warriors Fighting High: Shen Guoliang and Yang Shiqing are two dashing warriors fighting high. Shen only knew how to smash, giving up life for death, without any chance to return. The two sets ended in an instant. Score: 6-4, 6-4. Referee: Zhu Xilin.</p>
<p>Sweating and Battling, Same Surname No Mercy: Wang Hongye is old and stout, but his tennis techniques are very good. Wang Shanjun excels at counterattacks, but his forehand is relatively weak. The two family members with the same surname battled without any mercy. The large Wang ran east and west in the hot sun, displaying even more spirit. It is only fitting that he won 6-1, 6-3. Referee: He Ruzhi.</p>
<p>Veteran Players Clash, Neither Yielding: Jiang Tianpeng and Zhu Qitao are veteran players in this field, and both are not young. When the two old men met, neither was willing to yield, showing that while people get old, their rackets do not. It's a pity that Zhu's leg has been injured recently, and he lacks practice, so his power has diminished slightly. Jiang took advantage of the weakness and launched successive attacks, achieving successive feats and ultimately defeating the strong enemy with a score of 6-4, 6-2. Referee: Fang Heqin.</p>
<p>A Battle of Two Sticky Candies: The battle between Hu Huaqin and Tang Zhiming was extremely fierce, and it took three sets to determine the winner. When they raised their rackets and exchanged blows, the ball was low and flat, skimming the net back and forth for a long time without being lost. People ran north and south, sweating profusely, never tiring. They were truly a pair of sticky candies. After each set, they each drank a bottle of soda to moisten their internal organs and increase their power, showing that they were meticulous in every detail. Later, Hu used counterattack to hit vital points in motion, thus gaining victory. Score: 5-7, 6-1, 6-1. Referee: Zhang Longhai.</p>

Therefore, the interest rate was raised again by 7 hao and a half to 7 qian 2 fen 9 li 3 hao 7 hu and a half. The situation in the silver exchange market was consistently sluggish. The morning and afternoon markets still only did Kai 3 fen. Banks suspended all foreign exchange buying and selling and silver collection due to the Sunday holiday. The market made a total of 165,000 yuan in exchange drafts in the morning market and 300,050 yuan in the afternoon market.

<h3>Public Bond Delivery Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Today (28th) and tomorrow (29th) are the regular delivery dates for securities public bonds. The demand for foreign exchange is frequent every month during the delivery period. Due to the current situation, the market prices of various securities public bonds have frequently declined and there have been frequent suspensions of auctions, so there are many short sales in various aspects. At this time when market prices are holding firm, there is no opportunity to offset the shorts, so it is bound to find ways to deliver spot goods. Therefore, it is predicted that the delivery amount in this session will inevitably increase compared to normal times, and the urgent need for foreign exchange is expected.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in the Gold Market Last Week</h3>
<p>A disastrous drop of 39 liang 2 qian. The changes in the gold market last week were unusually drastic, and the fierce and rapid decline was truly alarming. The sudden disastrous drop of 40 liang has broken the 560 liang mark. The raging storm made it very difficult to predict. The daily ups and downs were unpredictable, with fluctuations ranging from five or six liang to more than ten liang. The turbulent waves were unstoppable, and people's minds were extremely confused and helpless, with no will. Only at the beginning of the week was it still peaceful outside of 590 liang, and it once reached 599 liang 1 qian, as Fuchang Hengxing and other bulls raised prices. Later, it gradually declined, and it was actually affected by the shaking of the Japanese cabinet and the decline of the Japanese-US exchange rate. The long-term stagnation of the Japanese-US exchange rate suddenly reported weakness, which was enough to cause panic among the general public. Most large bulls sold heavily, and the shorts added leverage. As for the silver market, it seemed that the exchange rate was rising and the exchange rate followed the half-penny. The gold price almost plummeted. By the weekend, it suddenly fell to within 560 liang, and the quoted price for Japanese gold was pressed outside of 80 liang. The high and low prices during this week totaled 45 liang 6 qian, which was also huge. The final price was more than 39 liang 2 qian lower than the previous Saturday. However, there was no change in the spot goods compared to before, and the scheduled bid increased by 5 or 6 liang. However, the transaction was unsuccessful due to the strict export ban. The general situation during the week is described below.</p>
<p>The low peak was 553 liang and a half. Since the beginning of the week (21st), British silver remained unchanged, US silver rose slightly, and the exchange rate also rose by half a notch. The bid price was inversely proportional. The buyers were agile, and because it was expected that the large strips would have to be raised higher last Saturday, but now it was not, people's minds were still firm. In addition, the internal market was stable and not loose. The rear market once rose to 99 liang 1 qian, but the result fell back by more than one liang. The closing price was 97 liang 4 qian, which was one qian more than the previous Saturday. The spot goods also rose slightly on that day, with an additional 6 liang. It seemed weak the next day. The large strips returned, but the exchange rates did not change. The internal market tended to be loose, so the opening price dropped by more than one liang. It was even weaker in the afternoon, and it once reached 93 liang. The closing price was 94 liang, and it only fell back by more than three liang. The daily review was no more than 5 liang. On Wednesday, the silver market continued to rise, the exchange rate did not change, the internal market was mediocre, and the gold market was flat and tired. The gold price was only 93 or 4 liang in the morning. However, in the afternoon, there were rumors that there was a storm in the Japanese cabinet and there was a general resignation, which suddenly broke the 90 liang mark, and speculators tended to sell, such as Taikang Runtian Yu Yong and others selling long positions on behalf of someone. However, the exchange rate happened to be Wednesday, there was no market, and the sudden change in the gold market was unexpected. The large strips rose again the next day. The former order did not move, and the internal market had already trended down. The Chinese merchants sold, causing the bid price to fall frequently. However, the morning was still good, and it was outside of 90 liang. In the afternoon, it suddenly broke the barrier. It was nothing more than the relationship with the Japanese cabinet. The ups and downs before and after the day actually had more than ten liang of changes. On Friday, although the large strips had shrunk back, the silver price did not change, and the former order saw half a notch. Therefore, the decline in the bid price became more intense, and the stormy waves fell sharply. The total market had more than 23 liang of twists and turns. Large households sold heavily, and the Japanese-US exchange rate reported a decline, which had already broken the 70 liang mark. The opening price in the afternoon fell to 62 liang 5 qian. The final 70 liang and 7 qian generally suffered a great blow to the long positions, and the market was extremely volatile. On Saturday, the low peak continued, with more than 18 liang in the half-day difference. The morning was still flat, the large strips rose again, and the trend of the internal market was even more tired. Therefore, it initially rotated between 70 liang. When it was almost noon, it was suddenly heard that the Japanese-US telecommunications was actually unattended, and the price was almost about to fall again. It suddenly broke 60 liang and suddenly reached 52 liang and a half. Large households still had to offset the short positions from the previous day during the morning. After the change, the sales were sold again, and the market was extremely fearful. The result was 57 liang. This week, the total decline was 39 liang 2 qian, which had fallen for five consecutive days, totaling 40 liang. The following table lists the high and low prices of British, American, and Indian silver markets, as well as exchange rate bid prices:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Change from Last Saturday</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Large Bar Near | 16 4375 Pence | 15 875 Pence | Up 0.3125 Pence</p>
<p>Large Bar Far | 15 0625 Pence | 15 75 Pence | Up 0.3125 Pence</p>

<p>Bid Price | 599 Liang 1 Qian | 553 Liang 5 Qian | Down 39 Liang 2 Qian</p>
<h3>British and American Silver Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's London Telegraph reported that the price of large bars of silver rose again, with a recent increase of 0.25 to 16 Pence 4375 (equivalent to 1 Shilling 7 Pence 4375), and a distant increase of 0.25 to 16 Pence 3125. The price of American silver rose by 0.0375 to 0.35375 yuan. The British exchange rate against the United States rose by 0.0003125 to 4 yuan 8 Jiao 6 Fen 75, and the American exchange rate against the United Kingdom increased by 0.000125 to 4 yuan 8 Jiao 6 Fen 8125. The Japanese-US exchange rate was still 49 yuan 3125, and the Japanese-US exchange rate was still 2 Shillings 0375. The British-Shanghai former order rose by 0.25 to 1 Shilling 7 Pence 125, and the Mumbai spot price increased by 3 Annas to 47 Rupees 03 Annas.</p>
<h3>Japanese-US Exchange Rate Outlook for Far Term is Bearish</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th Electrical Communication: Although the Japanese exchange rate against the United States has recently fallen by more than two pounds from the current delivery point, foreign banks have no current delivery plans. The reason is that when Citibank wanted to deliver in the present, the Bank of Japan ordered Yokohama Zhengjin to sell it, indicating an undisguised cash policy, resulting in this situation. The exchange market outlook for the far term is bearish. On the 26th, the selling price for the far term after November was 49 gold yuan and three-sixteenths, which has a causal relationship with the Shanghai market. This situation will continue for the time being.</p>
<h3>Securities: Last Week's Bond Prices Slightly Rebounded</h3>
<p>Trend Stabilized, Transaction Volume Exceeded 41 Million</p>
<p>Last week, the Shanghai securities market for various government bonds only opened one afternoon session, with a quiet market as before. Except for the 96 bonds, all bonds were opened, but the transaction volume was extremely small. The total transaction volume for the whole week was only slightly over 67 million yuan. Of this, except for the demobilization bonds of 20,000 yuan and the troop reduction bonds of about 12,000 yuan, all other bonds had only several thousand yuan in transactions. The futures market was relatively active in the first two days of the week, with a daily transaction volume of only about 5 million yuan. It improved slightly later, with a daily transaction volume of 7-8 million yuan. The bond market environment was calm, and major buyers and sellers were waiting and watching. Statistics show that the total transaction volume for the whole week was 41.005 million yuan, a decrease of over 5.5 million yuan compared to the previous week. Internal customs duty and demobilization bonds were still performing well. The demobilization bonds were 5.625 million yuan for the July term and 8.16 million yuan for the August term. The customs duty bonds were 4.035 million yuan for the July term and 6.05 million yuan for the August term. The troop reduction bonds were 3.075 million yuan for the July term and 4.365 million yuan for the August term. The other bonds were quiet, such as the rehabilitation bonds, which were 1.465 million yuan for the July term and 2.455 million yuan for the August term. The reorganization 6% bonds were 1.035 million yuan for the July term and 900,500 yuan for the August term. The extended bonds were 760,000 yuan for the July term and 685,000 yuan for the August term. The 96 bonds were 800,000 yuan for the July term and 385,000 yuan for the August term. The 7-year long-term bonds were 60,000 yuan for the July term and 110,000 yuan for the August term. The reissued 25 bonds were 480,000 yuan for the July term and 45,000 yuan for the August term. The financial long-term bonds were 145,000 yuan for the July term. The August term also opened with 50,000 yuan. The changes in various bonds during the past week were also due to the dull bond market environment and the proximity of the end-of-month settlement period. Except for hedging, there were very few large-scale transactions in the market. Therefore, the supply and demand trend was stable and harmonious, and there were no major changes every day. The price fluctuations only changed with the temporary market conditions. For example, the fluctuations were less than half a yuan in the first two days of the week. On Wednesday, the buying activity increased, and the prices rose slightly. However, on Thursday and Friday, the buying interest returned to being idle, and the prices gradually fell. On the last day of the week, there was a sudden increase in short covering in the market, and the prices rebounded. The trend of fluctuations was uncertain. The stable environment had little impact on the bond market, and major buyers and sellers were waiting and watching. As a result, the increase was greater than the decrease compared to the previous week. Demobilization and troop reduction bonds both rebounded by more than one yuan, and other bonds also generally strengthened slightly. However, the extended bonds, disaster relief spot bonds, and financial bonds were weak because there had been no market prices for a long time. The following are the statistics of the high and low prices of various bonds in the past week (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>| Bond Type    | Term/Spot | Highest (Day) | Lowest (Day) | Difference | Increase/Decrease |</p>
<p>| :----------- | :-------- | :------------ | :----------- | :--------- | :---------------- |</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn and Raw Cotton: Last Week's Yarn Market Completely Lacked Vitality</h3>
<p>Bulls and Bears Compete, Creating a Stalemate</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Demand Weak, Situation Extremely Bleak</p>
<p>The yarn market has been extremely bleak this week. This is due to the continued decline in the global cotton industry, which has softened people's hearts. However, the time is right for autumn sales, and the Cantonese merchants have purchased a significant amount of July and August forward yarn contracts in the yarn market, with a strong bullish outlook. However, domestic wars are raging, and transportation across various routes is disrupted, leading to a sharp rise in rice prices. Overseas, third-grade yarn is very cheap, and American cotton is trending downward due to reduced sales. The increasing pressure has led to a lack of upward momentum. Rui Da, Ri Xin Hang, and other major players have been selling in large quantities in the forward yarn market, with volumes of 30,000 to 40,000 bales. The competition between bulls and bears is fierce, creating a stalemate. The quantity of contracts and accounts accumulated by both sides is increasing daily. We must wait for the American cotton report and see if the autumn sales business is booming to determine the direction. Spot sales to the Cantonese and Yunnan merchants are relatively strong. The purchases from Xuzhou are mostly speculative. Statistics show that all merchants purchased 9,295 bales throughout the week, with 1,100 bales purchased by fellow traders. The market is calm, and Japanese yarn has fallen slightly. The forward yarn market picked up on the weekend due to the improvement in spot yarn business in Yunnan and Xuzhou, and most of the yarns were coarse yarns. People's hearts were slightly lifted, and the market trend stabilized. The prices for each month were close to increasing by five or six cents compared to the previous week, while the distant months fell by four or five cents. The total transaction volume for the whole week was 44,300 bales. Osaka third-grade yarn fell by seven or eight yuan. The following is a list of the purchase amounts for each merchant:</p>
<p>| Merchant   | Bales | Merchant   | Bales | Merchant   | Bales |</p>
<p>| :--------- | :---- | :--------- | :---- | :--------- | :---- |</p>
<p>| Hankou     | 160   | Sichuan    | 450   | Wuhu       | 550   |</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Cotton Market in a Week</h3>
<p>Hankou Forward Market: Near Strong, Distant Weak</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Mill Demand Declining</p>
<p>There were concerns about a decline in the cotton market in the past week. American cotton sales have decreased, the weather for new cotton is good, and cotton mills around the world have reduced their working hours and limited production. There is a surplus of cotton, so American cotton has gradually found a new low price. Spot prices once reached 12.625 cents. At that time, people's hearts were greatly shocked, and the panic-stricken bulls had to painfully liquidate their positions. The market trend was quite unstable. The lowest price for forward cotton was once 34.05 taels. Later, since the inventory of old cotton in August was thinner than last year, several banks organized a bullish company to prepare to absorb tens of thousands of pieces, with a short squeeze action. Therefore, although American cotton fell, it was purchased heavily in the August session, and the grain strength was particularly strong. Some people heard rumors of a short squeeze and covered their short positions and turned bullish. However, most people still have the strong idea of going short because the weather is good above. Only the Hankou merchants are selling old cotton and buying new cotton. The accumulated transaction volume between the two sides in August is increasing. As of Saturday, it was about 110,000 dan. There will be drastic changes afterward. A rise in August slightly strengthened the distant months. The forward yarn market initially fell and then rose. As a result, August rose by 3.5 cents compared to the previous week, while the distant months fell by 6.7 cents. The total transaction volume for the whole week was 314,400 dan. The source was only 4,200 dan of Yao cotton. The spot cotton transaction between manufacturers was quiet. The near-term futures were counted as 1,028 dan, and the numbers house acquired 1,620 dan. American cotton fell by 670 pounds more than the previous week. The following records the purchase amount of the manufacturers and number houses:</p>
<p>| Manufacturer  | Acquired Amount | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Contract Term       | Delivery Date | Notes     |</p>

<h3>Telegrams: American, British, and Indian Cotton Prices Rise</h3>

<h3>Grain: River Bottom Rice Market - South Firm, North Weak</h3>
<p>The General Trend Turns Downward... East New Japonica Opens at 19 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, about ten ships from various routes arrived at the Zhabei (North Shanghai) river. The river stock was sluggish due to consecutive days of sales. However, the northern japonica suddenly turned downward and stabilized because, according to Changshu and Wuxi telegrams, rice prices had rebounded by a huge 5-6 jiao. Therefore, the merchants' intentions turned firm, and they insisted on selling. In addition, the rice shops' intentions to purchase gradually became active. Therefore, high-quality japonica stabilized. Medium and low-quality japonica were only weak by a slight amount. East new japonica's declining trend was still strong, opening at 19 yuan, another half yuan lower. Thin rice sales were both weak, and the market for top-quality goods was better. White yuan continued to trend downward, and the way out was particularly uncomfortable. The market was high and stable, and the secondary quality was weak. On the whole, the price was slightly weak. However, the situation at the close of the market was quite stable. Although the prices of all stalls were weak, there was a clear downward stabilization trend. The trading between the two sides was still not developing, so the amount of rice was still small.</p>
<p>There were not many sources arriving at the river bottom market in South Shanghai, and the accumulated stock was also thin. Sales on this street were slightly better, and the northern japonica turned firm. Therefore, the sellers shouted prices as high as 2-3 jiao, which was better than the northern market. The Jiangsu and Tong japonica also became prosperous because they had been over-sold. The prices of each stall rebounded by about 1 jiao. Southern merchants' thin rice also became stable along with japonica. The overall market was slightly tight. Sheep Tuojian rice varied in strength. Although it was reported that foreign rice was firm, the sales were not smooth. Therefore, the prices were raised while suppressing the secondary quality. There was a fluctuation of about 1 jiao. The goods were scarce, and the price was stable and tending to be stable without any significant ups and downs.</p>

<h3>Platform Admonitions - Ms. Hua Hua</h3>
<p>Mr. Yang Xingfo recently gave a speech at the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau's summer school entitled "The Causes and Consequences of the Failure of New Education in China over the Past Thirty Years." The chairman, Mr. Zhou Shang, introduced Mr. Yang, who then took the stage and gave a speech full of admonitions, which are worth taking to heart. The following are excerpts to spread the word:</p>
<p>China Only Has the Power to Corrupt. Mr. Yang quoted Ma Xiangbo's speech at Datong University, saying that Liang Qichao wrote an article stating that the Chinese people were rich in assimilation power and could assimilate foreign races. The Chinese people were happy about this. In fact, we have no assimilation power, only the power to corrupt. Didn't you see that the Miao and Yao people who were driven away by the Yellow Emperor still exist in the southwestern borderlands after four thousand years? Why haven't they been assimilated? Foreigners have come to China and shaken the Central Plains. Our country often gifted daughters and silk to make them indulge in pleasure and corrupt them, making them happy and forget their homeland. The world was peaceful and nothing happened. This trend still prevails today. However, foreigners have seen through the reasons and now do not fall for our tricks. They have opened concessions and become independent regions, bringing their wives and daughters and refusing to be corrupted. No wonder our country is being trampled on even more severely and has no power to resist.</p>
<p>I Would Rather Have Three Years Without Education Than to Have the Qing Dynasty Fall and the Republic Rise. The textbooks published in the market changed the cover, from the Great Qing Empire to the Republic. The contents of the textbooks were mostly the same, just with a different skin. Recently, the National Government was established, and the general textbooks changed another cover. The teaching materials were slightly revised, and the Sanmin textbooks appeared. How can such a perfunctory revolution succeed? I would rather have no education in the country for three years and have all the textbooks in the schools burned, leaving no trace. According to the Three Principles of the People and our general life, we should rewrite them. The editors must receive considerable training to make the principles practical.</p>
<p>The Three Principles of the People Grow from the Land. The failure of the education aims in the past was due to their being unrealistic and not in line with life. Unfortunately, the current Three Principles of the People education is about to repeat the same mistake, still not breaking away from articles and lectures. The principles have been numb for a long time. The schools have been implementing party-based education for three years. May I ask, what is the difference between the graduates today and those in the past? The words "Three Principles of the People" are about to become the same as "Amitabha" and "Christianization," becoming a buzzword for street talk, saying one thing but thinking another. The reason is that everyone sees the principles as falling from the sky. They do not know that the Three Principles of the People are actually seeds that must be planted in the land, growing from the land to obtain roots, sprouts, and flourishing growth. It is easy to persuade all teachers to quickly plant the principles in the hearts of children so that they can be realized early. Then, the people of the country will kowtow nine times to thank you all.</p>
<h3>Another Anecdote from Chen Ying Shi's Childhood - Ji Guan</h3>
<p>This publication previously published an article about Mr. Chen Ying Shi of Wuhu saving a child from a fire in his childhood. His quick wit was praised by the world. I recently heard from a friend that when Mr. Chen was thirteen years old, he happened to go to a relative's house and saw a painting of a rolling horse by Zhao Mengfu. Its spirit was active, and everyone praised it. Mr. Chen did not think so. He immediately took a pen and ink and wrote a sentence on it: "The horse has loyal and heroic nature, but the painter is not the right person." He had been aware of Zhao's loss of his dignity as a member of the imperial family and his service to the Yuan Dynasty, which he disapproved of. His life's great integrity could be seen from his youth. It is appropriate that he followed the Premier from beginning to end without wavering, and even if he was assassinated, he is worthy of remembrance for thousands of years.</p>
<h3>The Passing of the Monk Qixigu, Who Lived in the Valleys - Zheng Yimei</h3>
<p>In the past, Han Yu sent the Buddhist Lingzong on a westward journey, saying that "his actions were different, but his feelings were the same as a gentleman, and it was okay to go with him." Qixigu was also a follower of Lingzong. He was the abbot of the Yuantong Temple in Wuzhong for thirty years. The temple was located on Fengxi Street, and the path was locked by white clouds. There were very few donors. Rocks were piled into hills, and fine trees were lined up to form a clear stream. A pavilion was built above, and leaning on the railing, one could see the red scales of the fish breathing and sinking, like the Jade Spring of Tiger Hill, only in a smaller scale. In the summer, the Xing Society gathered in the temple. More than ten members of the society sat in the pavilion and drank, and the wind came gently, making them forget that they were in the hot summer. Afterward, they entered the meditation room and asked Qixigu to tune the strings and play the qin. Qixigu burned incense in a stove and slowly played a "Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank." The sound was clear and far away, making people feel like they were in the northern desert. He was truly divine. Qixigu loved to plant flowers and plants. He had famous varieties of camellias and peonies, all planted by Qixigu himself. The poet Mr. Hu Shiyu once accompanied his friend Zhi Ting to the temple. When they arrived at the back garden, Qixigu was watering the flowers. After he finished, they asked him to play the qin. Mr. Hu gave him a poem: "Spring has passed, the flowers are still good, guests have come, the monk does not know. The Zen hall is exempt from visiting the Buddha, the fragrant garden should find poetry. A glimpse of Yuan Gong is working hard as a servant. When he stops watering, he tunes the red silk once. It is difficult for a rational qin to know the ancient sound, and the dust-covered faces of the two guests are tired. A white-haired monk is cold. Plucking the rhyme, I miss Yuan An's string, not learning because of fate. I think of my Buddha, don't take it casually." Qixigu was also able to write poetry, and he had many fine works. He often sang and echoed with Xi She and Shu Wenmei. Mr. Shiyu knew Qixigu through Wenmei's introduction. When Wenmei passed away, Mr. Shiyu was moved by the temple, saying, "The secluded contract is cut off in the world, and the eccentric person seeks it outside the world. The fragrance of flowers is suitable for Buddhist temples, and the qin principles enter the Zen mind. Talk about old times, gallop quickly, worry about the world, and feel deeply. The soul of a white-haired ghost-poet returns to Donglin together." Anyone who talks about Wuzhong's anecdotes knows Qixigu's character. Last year, Qixigu went to Sichuan and climbed Mount Emei. On the way, he was exposed to miasma and fell ill as soon as he returned. I recently received a letter from my friend Jiang Yinqiu, saying that Qixigu had passed away. I felt extremely sad when I heard this, so I wrote to record it. Qixigu's dharma name was Guangzhi, and he had a clear and gaunt appearance. His hands drooped past his knees, which was quite unusual.</p>
<h3>Recording the Scandal - Gang Shu</h3>
<p>In Zhenjiang Yaoyiwan, there was a wealthy merchant named Xu, whose son was over the age of passing the imperial examinations. He had recently lost his wife and had nothing to do. He was unwilling to be a new widower. In Chen Mou's family in Dayangjia Lane in the same city, his aunt and father-in-law had a concubine. Mr. Xu, who was over forty years old, was wanton and constantly resented Chen Mou for being old. Mr. Xu knew that he could plot something, so he often came to seduce her, and the secret appointments were more than once. They were affectionate and as close as glue. Chen Mou was often traveling in Suzhou and Shanghai, and was rarely in the village. The two became even more unscrupulous, and the scandalous rumors spread throughout the neighborhood. Chen Mou had heard something about it, but he did not dare to believe it without any evidence. However, he was carefully investigating it every day. On the morning of the eighteenth day of the month, Chen Mou finished tea with a friend and returned home. He saw that the doors of the bedroom were tightly closed and knew that Mr. Xu was inside. Chen Mou was unbearable and secretly invited neighboring friends, relatives, and watchmen to come together to testify. He caught them on the spot and severely rebuked Mr. Xu and ordered him to take the concubine away. Mr. Xu initially argued strongly, but after the concubine fully revealed the past situation and Mr. Xu's promise to provide her with food and clothing for the rest of her life and swore not to change her mind, Mr. Xu was speechless. The concubine then took his hand and went with him. Afterward, Chen Mou checked the concubine's clothes and luggage and found that they had all been swept away, knowing that she had been planning for a long time. He was even more enlightened. However, Chen Mou was lenient.</p>
<h3>Eastern Travel Impressions (16) Qian Hua</h3>
<p>(12) Conference Propaganda Policy</p>
<p>The development of Japanese sports owes 40-50% to the publicity efforts of its news media. Each newspaper has a sports section, and they try their best to publish sports news and photos, averaging over 20% of the total news content. They also frequently organize large-scale sports events and international competitions with the newspaper as the organizer, such as the East-West Athletics Competition organized by Osaka Asahi, the German-Japanese Sports Meet, the French-Japanese Tennis Competition organized by Osaka Mainichi, farewell competitions for female athletes going to Europe, and the Kansai International Sports Meet, directly and indirectly enhancing the skills and interests of Japanese athletes. There are also various sports magazines, such as the Osaka Asahi's sports special issue (published twice a month) and the Sports Monthly published by the Sports Association, which are the most famous, with sales reaching hundreds of thousands of copies. The Track and Field Association, the Water Sports Association, and the Women's Sports Association each announce the top ten athletes in various sports annually, calling them the ten "monsters" of a certain Japanese sport. For example, last year's top ten female 100-meter runners had a first-place time of 12 seconds by Hitomi Kinue, and the tenth-place time was 13.2 seconds, which is still better than Sun Guiyun's recent time of 13.6 seconds. In addition, many shops use enlarged sports photos as window advertisements, displaying jumping and running scenes, which can attract the attention of pedestrians and indirectly develop their business. Photos are supplied by the Jiji Tsushin-sha photo agency, two or three photos per day, and the fees are very low. Therefore, the faces of athletes with a little reputation are deeply imprinted in the minds of the general public. This time, the Far Eastern Games were held in Japan, and most of the sports section chiefs were members of the Japanese Sports Association, so their propaganda methods were very consistent. To name it, it can be called the conference propaganda policy. Before the conference opened, the newspapers could be said to have done their best in propaganda, and their investigation of the strength of China and the Philippines was even more detailed. They also greatly praised Liu Changchun and Sun Guiyun, praising them as China's pioneers and Japan's strong enemies. In terms of commentary, except for track and field, all-around sports, and swimming, where Japan had an absolute grasp of the championships, they tried their best to praise the techniques of the Chinese and Philippine teams in other events. They said that China's football team was a perennial victor and very strong, and that the Chinese and Philippine basketball and volleyball teams were lively and difficult to resist without Japan giving their all. They said that the Chinese Honolulu baseball team was experienced and would fight a bloody battle with Japan, and they also exaggerated the skills of Lin and Qiu in tennis. In this way, the Japanese team's athletes knew that they had to be vigilant. Once they fought, because they had a sense of fear in advance, they could bravely and calmly defeat the enemy and achieve the final victory. However, our country's newspapers have become the opposite, with pre-event encouragement and praise being too far from the truth, unconsciously fostering a sense of arrogance and complacency, and inviting defeat. This is the effect of the propaganda policy. After the conference opened, the tone of Japanese newspapers changed again. The descriptions of the Japanese teams' battles and individual techniques were detailed, while the reports of events involving China, the Philippines, and India were simplified. This was to encourage the courage of the soldiers and promote their own prestige. However, the problems of unfair refereeing and the opposition from China and the Philippines were not mentioned at all. Fortunately, the Shanghai press had special dispatches this time, otherwise the Japanese would have covered up the world's eyes and ears. This newspaper deeply knows that the conference news from the Japanese cannot be relied upon, so each venue has a specialist responsible for recording, seeking true and fair news from the perspective of the Chinese. For example, in the open track and field competition on May 17, the Japanese news agency actually sent a telegram saying that Zhang Lingjia won second place in the 400-meter hurdles preliminary. Our country's newspapers did not investigate and were deceived, and they even published a photo of Zhang. The open competition was not added by our entire country, and at that time, Zhang was working hard in the second half of the decathlon and had no time to join the open hurdles race. The truth was clear, and the reporter was also recording on the spot at the time. The so-called Zhang Lingjia was actually a Korean Kim, whose hamstring was injured when he started and barely walked across the hurdles to reach the finish line. He fainted after the last hurdle and was helped out for treatment. The facts were like this, but they called a deer a horse, trying to insinuate Zhang Lingjia. There are countless examples of news like this. The most heartbreaking thing is that the result of the China-Philippines football match was five to zero, but a certain news agency sent a telegram saying it was eight to zero, which was ridiculed at home and abroad. This newspaper has never published a single word of this kind of inaccurate news, so it can be said to be innocent to the public.</p>
<p>Dawei Huai did not pursue the matter, but only asked a lawyer to submit a petition to the official authorities for filing and published a statement disclaiming the relationship. Anyone who knew Chen would applaud and celebrate. Chen has pampered this concubine in every possible way for the past twenty-seven years, but this concubine has no virtue and is slow to make friends and alienates relatives (but she is not slow to treat her beloved friends, and she does not alienate her beloved relatives). She acts arrogantly and uses her power to bless those she likes. Relatives and friends do not interact with her, and neighbors also look askance. Chen is frugal in his own expenses, but this concubine squanders money. Once she is exposed and expelled, it is probably because the concubine's sins have reached their limit and Chen's karma has been cleared.</p>
<h3>European Travel Correspondence (64) Liu Haisu</h3>
<p>The French Autumn Salon</p>
<p>(4) An Overview of the Works of 1929 (Middle)</p>
<p>Entering the first room again, directly in front is a portrait of "Madame Someone" by the darling of the modern Parisian art scene, Van Dongen. It is not accurate to say that her posture and eyebrows are touching, beautiful, or pure. It is difficult to find a suitable word to describe her. It is actually a kind of "glamour." No, it really has a kind of aesthetic bewilderment. Only in Parisian dance halls or grand banquets, or when entering the opera house, have I felt a similar charm. But looking closely at his paintings, there is no special composition, nor is there the so-called expression of thought in ancient portrait paintings. It is just an ordinary painting, a portrait painting. But what is the reason why it can have a special and stronger force and move the audience? I can say that the special spirit of modern Europe and Paris is expressed in Van Dongen's paintings without reservation. The vitality of Europe, the lust of Paris, and the mystery of modern Europeans seem to penetrate the joys of the world and the sins of the world from the light eyes and charming gestures. To the right of it is a large painting by Marval. She is a famous first-class female painter in France, but there is no feminine air in her bold and vigorous strokes. In his transcendent and ideal painting, apart from showing its independent life to directly appeal to our vision, she has no other intention. Haha, this is a painting by my old friend Ishii Hakutei, depicting four figures on a Japanese-style terrace drinking and watching the scenery. The overall color tone feels solemn, making people feel like they are listening to the sound of wooden fish in a quiet night. This can also be said to be mysterious. He is also one of the most eye-catching foreign products in the Autumn Salon. In the center of the second room are three landscape paintings by Marquet. Marquet is a famous Parisian landscape painter with a simple tone. His style is very unique. He uses only elegant colors to express distant scenery, and the sentiment is extremely vivid. It is truly a unique technique. Over there are two landscape paintings by Vlaminck. These are bold and Fauvist paintings. A seascape by Matisse and a nude by Derain are also hung high over there. This area is mostly occupied by the giants of Fauvism, so there is no need for me to ramble on. In the middle of the fourth room, on one wall, are two small works of only a few inches by Bonnard, occupying a large wall. It can be said that all the colors on his paintings are the joyful rhythm created by nature. The value of his works lies in the "feeling of space." Bonnard can be considered one of the Impressionists, but he is unwilling to use colors to analyze. He wants to use the harmony of colors to create pure paintings in a comprehensive way, and he inevitably leans towards the decorative side. He purely uses lines, colors, and composition of decorative effects to create, and is full of poetic sentiment. His human figures and portraits not only use yellow and white, but he also uses blue, yellow, red, and purple in a disorderly manner, which combines from feeling to become a very beautiful and tasteful flesh color. He is a bridge from Impressionism to modern emerging art. He does not belong to any school of painting and has opened up a new path. In the history of emerging art, he is a pioneer alongside Matisse.</p>

<h3>Book Review</h3>
<p>Japanese Camellia Forest</p>
<p>Edited by the Japanese Research Society</p>
<p>Published by Huatong Bookstore</p>
<p>Most countries now use imperialist means against China. Among them, what people can't forget day and night is the so-called "scorpion stance" of that country only separated by a strip of water (Japan). Japan, whether in politics, geography, or culture, and in time, whether in the past, present, or future, has the deepest and most important relationship with China. Since the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese government and people have adhered to the traditional and consistent policy of aggression. Whether it is southward or northward, China is the target of aggression. "Emptying the dipper to drink drunk, dreaming of trampling down China's four hundred provinces" is so terrible. What's not worth our attention?</p>
<p>China is known as a country with vast land and abundant resources. There are many things that even we have not carefully noticed, but foreigners, especially Japan's academic reconnaissance teams, have fully surveyed them. "Let's try to go to the bookstores in Tokyo to see the books they have written on Chinese issues. I don't know how many there are on philosophy, literature, politics, economics, society, geography, history, etc., divided into categories and meticulous. The articles published in monthly magazines studying Chinese issues are at least several hundred. Each year, the ruling authorities and social groups dispatch no less than several thousand people to China for permanent investigation or travel and inspection. The investigation and research expenses spent amount to 5-6 million yuan per year. The results of the investigation are compiled into books, and there are no less than ten books of dozens of huge volumes, such as the "Complete Book of Chinese Economy" and the "Complete Record of Chinese Provinces." The amount of content and the completeness of the collection are enough to make us frightened. In this way, they apply it to economic competition and military strategies, so how can they not be successful? In the past, there have been several enthusiastic anti-Japanese movements. Young people in the country ran around and called out, but there was no one who could study the object, understand the object, and lead the masses with the correct strategy, so failure was naturally expected. "Japanese Research" is to adapt to our current needs, holding "We want to use the historical perspective and scientific judgment to analyze, summarize, and become an iron-clad conclusion of everything about Japan's politics, economy, education, customs, religion, literature, philosophy, and various social phenomena and their constituent causes, and introduce everything real about Japan. We want to resist Japan's economic aggression, how can we not understand their organization and changes? We want to oppose Japan's militarist ideology, how can we not understand their political tradition and causes? In the political position, we cannot defeat the enemy if we do not understand the enemy's situation. In the academic research position, we cannot prove its theory without accurate review. So we decided that "Whether standing in a political position or in the academic research position, we should return everything, everything about Japan's country, society, and culture, to what it is and why, and clearly dissect it and contribute it to the people of the whole country" (foreword). In fact, Japan's creation of modern new forces is on the one hand, China, India, and Korea import various spiritual civilizations, which can be integrated and adapted to their own lives to create national characteristics and establish the foundation of the country. On the other hand, it is also able to accept Western scientific civilization. Secondly, the strength of national consciousness and national self-confidence also constitutes the nation's vitality and continuous upward development. So today, with China's current situation, the research on Japan cannot be ignored. Why is Japan constantly improving, but China is declining instead? Then how should we catch up quickly?</p>
<p>Therefore, the discovery of "Japan" magazine is very gratifying, and it can also be said to be fighting for our desolate magazine industry. This is the first issue of the inaugural issue, and the content is very rich, and it is all based on field investigations and collected, clearly exposing the truth and content of Japan. Here is a brief introduction.</p>
<p>In Liu Baimin's "The Process and Results of Japan's Second General Election," we can roughly understand the traditions and causes of Japan's political situation. Although the parties are arguing fiercely, the consistent policy towards the outside world remains the same. Even in this general election, apart from the problems of diplomacy and governance, it proves the deep roots of their militarist ideology. Although the fierce face of Tanaka of the Seiyukai has been removed, what is the difference between Hamaaguchi of the Minseito? Qu Jingzhou's "Japan's Prohibition and Lifting of Gold Exports" reveals Japan's economic situation. The causes and consequences before and after the lifting of gold exports and the impact after Japan implemented the lifting of gold exports are obvious. In "International Trade," both real goods and currency, "bad scenery" and "prices" are very bad. The so-called "economic national difficulty" and "ideological national difficulty" are further deepened after the lifting of gold exports. Ma Zongrong's "Japanese Proletarian Educator, Mr. Todo Gororo's Japanese Education Theory" Here only covers the former part, "The Reality of Japanese Education," explaining the unified doctrine of education and the special rights of education. The special rights of education are first the special rights of school education, and secondly the special rights of official school education. The special rights of wealth and capital also extend their evil hands to collude with the first two special rights and act as accomplices to monopolize everything, which is a counterattack against the Chinese education community. Wang Yitao's "Research on the Japanese Rice Law" is to awaken China's food policy, which has no unified mistake. Since the European War, all countries have learned from the war and are eager to implement food policies. Most countries are seeking to revitalize agriculture to strengthen the country and equalize grain prices to benefit farmers. Japan is also a country based on agriculture. Although Japan's current rice law has not reached perfection, what is the domestic situation in our country? Moreover, recently the price of rice has risen and people's lives have become increasingly impoverished, so China's affairs should be thoroughly studied, comprehensively planned, and domestic conditions should be considered, and the facilities of various countries should be adopted to determine the country's century-old plan. Liang Qinjun's "Recent Situation of the Japanese Army" is what China must study today in order to resist the strong, seek survival, and seek equality. After the Sino-Japanese War, Japan regarded China as its meat on the chopping board. The victory in the Russo-Japanese War was even more arrogant and aggressive. Europe took advantage of the fact that the powers were too busy to take care of the East and carried out large-scale aggression and expanded its military power as much as possible. The ambition to dominate the world was evident in words. Its army system mostly adopts the German system and imitates it, and the spirit and form are extremely magnificent and are praised by the powers. This article only covers "the distinction between military orders and military government organs" and the organization of the "Army Department" into the "Training Supervision Department." It is not yet complete. Pang Minjun's "The Relationship between Future Wars and Japan and the Three Eastern Provinces" is worthy of our attention. Everyone knows that in modern warfare, the replenishment of military supplies is the first thing that needs to be solved. But to make natural shapes into practical shapes, heat or electricity must be used. The most effective of these burning materials is coal, followed by iron ore, which is necessary for industry, and then petroleum. Japan is ambitious and unwilling to die, but it is a fact that it lacks various raw materials, so it has to be eager to investigate and prepare. Therefore, China's Three Eastern Provinces have been visited first. The natural products of the Three Eastern Provinces are so rich that they cannot solve all of Japan's economic, livelihood, and national defense problems, but they can obtain most of them. In terms of food, there are grains and livestock, as well as soybean cakes that support Japanese agriculture. There is a lot of iron ore and coal. Also, by chemical methods, the shortage of petroleum can be supplemented. The main raw materials for the chemical industry, salt magnesium ore and dolomite, are also produced in large quantities. Looking at it this way, how can Japan not make a wishful calculation to get the Three Eastern Provinces? The author also separately publishes comparative charts of the output of various items, which is even more alarming. Readers really don't know what to think when they read it. Zhou Yihe's "The Social Movement of Japanese Women" analyzes the occurrence, development process, and future of the Japanese women's movement very clearly, which is enough for Chinese women activists to refer to. It is puzzling that Japanese women's status in society is low and their lives are slaves, even after the Meiji Restoration, women still do not have the rights they should enjoy. After reading Wu Ziqiang's "Japanese Normal Education," and then looking back at China's normal education, how different are the strengths of education to promote personal improvement, and normal education occupies the center of the education system. This is the case in any country. Secondly, Liu Jiahuan's "Research on the Japanese National Flag," Xin Jieliu's "Ethnological Investigation of Modern Japanese," "Japanese Suicide," "Japanese Wedding Superstitions," and Yuan Suyi's "Hinata New Village Communication" are more interesting to read and are also worth our research and review.</p>
<p>In short, if we want to resist imperialism, we must study imperialism so that everyone recognizes the tricks of imperialism. Among these imperial</p>

<p>In imperialism, due to the priority of interests, "Japan" should be taken as the first target. Therefore, the definition of "Japanese Magazine" is indeed the hope eagerly requested by the entire nation in this difficult era. I hope that the members of the Japanese Research Society will actively work hard.</p>
<h3>An Overview of Chinese Folk Literature, Enlarged Edition</h3>
<p>Authored by Yang Yin-shen, published by Hua Tong Bookstore</p>
<p>Folk literature is the only treasure trove in literature. In China, there are indeed few people excavating this treasure. Although some people noticed it a few years ago, "it didn't last long and now it's like clouds scattering and smoke dissipating." It's like a kind and honest person witnessing countless gold and honey but ignoring them. However, this "gold" is mixed with yellow sand, and the "honey" has not undergone artificial processing and cannot be used as food. The Chinese people have an unfavorable laziness that seems to be deeply rooted. Therefore, they clearly know that this "gold" and "honey" are the greatest treasures in the world, but spending a lot of time and energy to excavate these treasures is not what we Chinese people inherently desire. This is truly the only defect that prevents folk literature from deeply penetrating the minds of intellectuals. If we want to remedy this defect, we can only rely on the modern youth who love literature and art to urgently rise up and advocate for the research of "folk literature and art."</p>
<p>Originally, folk literature and art profoundly contain "national consciousness." Although it cannot escape the feudal, religious, otherworldly, and individual-centered thinking, we cannot deny the seeds of "national consciousness" that it sows. The Book of Songs is a collection of folk literature from that time, and people still sing it to this day, becoming a permanent and immortal masterpiece. This is also because it belongs to folk literature, so it still circulates to this day. It is a pity that Chinese literati have never paid much attention to folk literature. It is still the same now. Some know the value of folk literature, but are afraid of the troublesome collection procedures and lightly ignore it. Some conservatives not only rarely use it, but even despise it. Therefore, a large amount of folk literature, as valuable as supreme treasures, still remains in the mouths and memories of the people.</p>
<p>This is truly something to lament. Moreover, even a systematic book discussing folk literature cannot be found in abundance in China. Research on this type of literature is even more "rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns." We must understand that folk literature originally possesses "breadth" and "permanence." No matter what, it should be cherished. Because in a specific country, literary works containing the "national consciousness" of that country should not be neglected. Moreover, this folk literature expresses the nationality of the country. All of this can be discovered anytime and anywhere in the folk songs, legends, myths, and ballads that are circulated. It is easy to find in the lines that reveal true emotions. This shows the value of folk literature in literature.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Yin-shen's book "An Overview of Chinese Folk Literature" is a somewhat systematic book on the study of folk literature. Especially in China, where literati have always neglected folk literature, the publication of such a book is very important. However, the merits and demerits of the book itself are another matter. I believe that Mr. Yang's "Overview" can at least serve as a reference for those who study folk literature, and it will undoubtedly awaken those who have always neglected this type of literature.</p>
<p>Apart from the two introductory "Introduction" and "Conclusion" at the beginning and end of the book, the important discussions are further divided into six chapters: Chapter 1 "What is Folk Literature," Chapter 2 "Folk Literature and Literature," Chapter 3 "The Origin of Folk Literature," Chapter 4 "The Value of Folk Literature," Chapter 5 "The Classification of Folk Literature," and Chapter 6 "The Works of Folk Literature." It is printed in size four font, probably for the purpose of making it easier for readers to understand.</p>
<p>In Chapter 1, "What is Folk Literature," the author uses the most concise writing style to clearly describe what is called folk literature and how it is worth our appreciation and research. Although this has already been discussed in the "Introduction" of the book, here the author further provides a simple explanation so that readers can understand what folk literature is. This is the shortest chapter in the entire book, but it allows us to gain a deep impression and understand that ancient transmissions such as folk songs, riddles, ballads, jokes, biographies, myths, etc. are all so-called "folk literature." Moreover, this folk literature is also a literature that combines these many literatures. It belongs to oral narration and is heard by the ears, narrated and orally transmitted by the general public. The folk literature described here is truly worthy of our attention. Furthermore, the author quotes the words of the American Hunt (TbdeoolowHunt) to explain the conditions that literature should possess, and folk literature is the same. He said, "Literature is the literary expression of thought, passing through imagination, emotion, and interest, and making it easy for the general public to understand and arousing interest in a non-specialized form." Therefore, since folk literature is easily understood by the general public and the writing is not "specialized," it is bound to arouse people's appreciation and interest. Moreover, it also has "natural rhythm, precise structure," thoughts, imagination, emotions, etc., and even transmits through thousands of years without being extinguished. This is truly the best proof. Therefore, folk literature is a genuine form of literature.</p>

<h3>The Story of World Literature (183) Authored by John Macy (American), Translated by Hu Zhongchi</h3>
<p>Chapter 47: The American Novel</p>
<p>Among the writers who recently passed away, the most memorable is Stephen Crane, the most talented American writer of that era, who ended his short life along with the 19th century. His story of the Civil War, "The Red Badge of Courage," may have been somewhat obscured by the more terrible wars that followed. However, the skill of the story cannot fade. There was also a talented young man who died young, the true realist Frank Norris, who displayed the power to handle grand themes. His great material is a true narrative poem. Among the existing novelists, the most outstanding artist is Edith Wharton. The scenes she depicts are New York or the villas where wealthy New Yorkers spend their summers. She is a very intelligent, somewhat foppish, but fundamentally sympathetic aristocrat. In "Ethan Frome" and "Summer," she used the same sure force as the best works of Mary E. Wilkins Freeman to narrate the tragedies of the New England countryside. Many modern American story writers seem to be mesmerized by the magic of O. Henry, a character with genuine talent and elegant wit. He is a gifted storyteller, full of creativity and inventiveness, but flawed by an excessively journalistic style. To appreciate the flaws of that clever character, the reader only needs to return to O. Henry, i.e., H.C. Bunner, slightly earlier, to see that a refined style can convey perfectly literary art combined with the human content that is the element of the permanently living novel. In the American novel, I see the growth of human content and abundant examples of excellent technique. However, the awareness of a more beautiful style, although by no means lacking, has not been developed as enthusiastically as in other countries today. Improvement in that direction is ultimately only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Chapter 48: American Essays and History</p>
<p>America is beginning to assert its own claims to knowledge and fantasy for its children. The intellectual center of America in the mid-nineteenth century was Boston and the neighboring cities of Cambridge and Concord. However, New England did not exclusively dominate the American intellectual world. There was also lively literary activity in New York and Philadelphia. Irving and Cooper were sons of New York State. Poe, a starving genius who seemed to come from the kingdom of God, lived in New York during his most productive and relatively glorious years and launched a fierce attack on the hegemony of New England from that fortress. However, that hegemony, although it did not appear to be without decline, was as certain as the hegemony of Florence in Italy. Boston, in the absence of humorous titles or ridicule, was often called the Athens of America.</p>
<p>It is certain that the thoughts that shone on all of America and have not lost their gentle brilliance to this day came from a small group of thinkers living in a small, rural civilization. There is now a tendency to undervalue that civilization, and that it certainly has many weaknesses. The poetry of that civilization lacked originality of content and mastery of form. The only true artists in prose are Hawthorne and Holmes, two memorably few individuals. The limitations are clear and justified by cataloging. However, the New England writers, taken as a whole, expressed</p>
<p>created a pure culture that spread beyond New England and became national in the broadest possible scope of national character in extremely heterogeneous and even hostile temperaments.</p>
<p>The leading thinker of that era was the son of a hereditary Puritan preacher, a rebellious child of the austerity of those ancestors and the refined, purified liberalism of their virtues, Emerson. The virtues he preached and exemplified were simple: self-reliance, not blind to the harsh facts of life, optimism, a serene state of mind, gentleness towards people, and faith in the God who resides in the human heart, not in formal religion, etc.</p>
<p>Emerson's essays and speeches were sermons. Although he withdrew from the Unitarian Church and was not a follower of any faith or denomination for most of his life, he was a preacher throughout his life. In terms of tone and content, his sermons were far more than the monotonous preaching of the pulpit. The eloquence was both natural and sincere. The wisdom was adorned with poetic explanations, metaphors, sharp satirical remarks, and humor. Hundreds of sentences in Emerson's writing are worth quoting for their keen insight, vigor, and extreme compactness of expression.</p>
<p>One reason why his thinking is so keen and richly patterned is because he knew how to select ideas from other writers that were suitable for his own purposes</p>
<p>and make them his own. "Next to writing beautiful prose," he said, "is quoting it first." This explains an important part of his talent. However, in a secondary sense, he was not imitative or derivative. He thoroughly Emersonized everything he touched. The enchantment of his contemporaries' voices and personalities is lost to us, but there is still vocal persuasiveness in his printed words. Just open any page of his "Essays," "The Conduct of Life," "Representative Men," or "Society and Solitude," and you will hear a person talking. Those various thoughts are gathered together under broad, abstract titles such as "Nature," "Politics," and "Compensation," but the thoughts themselves are direct, specific, and vivid.</p>
<p>Emerson had little interest in systems or logical arguments. His essays are said to have almost no structural unity, able to be read from the back as well, like a string of pearls that can be counted from both ends. However, the pearls are pure, or, as Emerson often changed the wording so quickly, the underlying personality of Emerson himself gives unity to the scattered thoughts. There are deeper and more systematic philosophers than he, and there are essayists with finer literary art as well. His poetry, although it has many outstanding lines, has its wings clipped and cannot soar among the immortals. However, Emerson's greatness cannot be denied. That greatness is his own. He clearly indicated his own words: "The best of beauty is on the surface, in the contour, a more exquisite enchantment than skill; otherwise, the rules of art can often teach that which radiates from the works of the human character of art," and he issued his most mysterious sentence, "Beware when the great God lets loose a thinker on this planet," although he was too modest and jocular not to have intended a personal application as we might have thought, it also hinted at himself.</p>
<p>God seems to have unleashed several thinkers in one corner of this planet, New England. One was Emerson's friend and neighbor, Thoreau. He had little influence on his contemporaries, but his genius is being increasingly recognized as new readers discover him. His main work, "Walden," is a record of his two years of solitude and self-reliance spent in the forests near Concord. He demonstrated that he could live independently of society and that he and nature mutually satisfied each other. The charm of the book lies in the fact that Thoreau enjoyed his chosen and excessively free life from the bottom of his heart. "Every morning was a pleasant inducement to make my life as simple and, I may say, as innocent as Nature herself." The nature he worshiped was indeed simple and pure, and his observations of the goddess's mood were direct, original, and unique, without excessively elaborating on the professional knowledge of the "naturalist."</p>

<p>The Art World</p>
<h3>The Novel of Black People by Yang Changxi</h3>
<p>In the article "The Poetry of Black People," I have already made a brief review of the national consciousness expressed by American black slaves in poetry. However, poetry is only a sharp accusation, only a warning siren for national awakening. In reality, what can truly describe the real lives of black slaves under the rule of white people in America is the novel. Therefore, in the novel, we see not the groans of a slave, but an epitome of the entire nation's slave life.</p>
<p>Although American black people cannot escape the influence of white people materially, they have their own national spirit culturally and literarily. This is because, first, before white blood was injected, Negroes had advancement and effort in Africa. And American black people’s genius writers had never accepted any white people’s influence from the beginning to the end, and there were few traces of white people in their works. So, secondly, their contribution to American culture, their contribution to art and literature, was more intense than the contribution British gave to America. Although Americans want to reject the Negro influence in American culture and literature, their power becomes more intense as they try to reject it. You can refer to Negro white’s (Clarencecameionwhite) "Negros gift to American Music" and Locke's (AlainLocke) "The Negro in American Culture" and Schuyler’s (Schuyler) "Our Greatest Gift to American." Therefore, although they have been smelted and immersed for many years, not only can their national character be wiped away, they can stand alone on the mainstream of American culture, and it can be seen how strong the national character of black people is.</p>
<p>However, the expression of national character in the novel has only recently become clear. Because they rarely have confidence in themselves in the early years. Since the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, what they express in their works has become more acute. There are many hosts of this association among this group of novelists. Many are dedicated to implying their enthusiasm in literary works to inspire black people. So, naturally, they released all their signals from their novels. Although not large in quantity, it is obvious to know that the black people's demand for freedom is very obvious.</p>
<p>In the short story "Shadow" (abadow) written by Edwards (HarryStillwellEdwords), a fourteen-year-old Negro boy was imprisoned for theft and was sentenced to twenty years of hard labor in a mine. Later, the three daughters of the warden asked his father for the release of this black child as their Christmas gift. Then he was lucky to get freedom. He clearly portrays the harshness of white people toward black slaves’ crime. Although he was released, it was just that white people regarded him as a gift and did not regard him as a person, vaguely implying that Negroes were looking for their own way out. Turpin’s (EdnaTurpin) "Abrams Freedom" is the story of liberating black slaves after the American Civil War. The black slave Abram fell in love with the free young woman Emmeline. Emmeline regarded her lover as the highest ideal in life. I</p>
<h3>White Goose Painting Association Chen Qiucao’s Work</h3>
<p>I</p>
<p>In the years when Abram served as the groom for his master to seek freedom, Emmeline had been working hard to help her husband gain freedom. Although she still wanted to live in the master’s house to work after gaining freedom, it can be seen how black slaves wanted to gain freedom from the power of white people. Duncan's (NarmanDuncar) "Ahypotbeticalcase" clearly describes white people beating black children, and black children do not have the right to beat him. Shazi's (LBYates) "The Chalk Game" describes the fate of black children in the competition. Failure clearly shows the transcendent nature of the black race.</p>
<p>The above authors are all very peaceful. However, since the novelist Bois (WBurghardtDuBois) issued a speech in Atlarta in 1912, black people have made new accusations against Americans. Therefore, the novelists after that time have all turned in their description. They changed direction from the gentle field to the stage of surrender. So, in Walter White's (WalterWbite) "Fireiptheflint," he chose a doctor</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>as his nationalist propagandist. The female writer Fursed (JessieFauset) regarded a dancer as the symbol of her light in "Thereconfusion." Nasheng (NhllaLarsen) took a black elementary school teacher as the protagonist of his description in "Quicksand." In the revolutionary novelist Bois’ "ThedarkprnessClaude," he portrayed an arrogant woman as the hero he wanted to create. In McKayHome’s "toHarlemRudolpb" and Feser's (Fisher) "The WallsofGericho", they more clearly described the challenge between black people and white people, and portrayed the black people's enthusiasm for freedom to the point where it could no longer be delayed. Therefore, the novelist who can best represent the nationalism of black people is still the last group of people. Because in their works, you can see the "New Negro," you can mention the "NegroReuoissonce."</p>
<p>Now the black novel is turning to the efforts in the practical life and awakening the national consciousness because of their conscious works. So, the black Locke said in his "The contribution of black people to American culture"</p>
<p>"Our young Negro artists should express all the life, thoughts and activities of our black-skinned people without shame and fear. If white people are willing, we also like it. If they don’t like it, it doesn’t matter. We know that we are beautiful. We think that we are an excellent nation. We want to build temples clearly. We know how strong we are. We stand on the high mountains. Freedom is within ourselves." (Quoted the declaration of the Black Literary Movement of LangstonHughes)</p>
<p>By that time, their nation will rise, just as Bloreller (BejaominBrawley) said</p>
<p>"We will one day have our great national plan. We will one day have a government that defends the people. One day our children will no longer be slaves to mines or machinery. We will have the residence of the elect designated by God for our nation"</p>
<p>Gossip in the literary world</p>
<h3>The Peculiar Personality of Jones</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that the recently deceased last year British 19th-century playwright, Mr. Jones, was a stalwart of the British dramatic revival at that time. Because in the late 19th century, the potential forces that dominated the British theatrical world had three aspects. The first potential force was the old moral values of the general public, which bound the author's thoughts. The second potential force was that ancient, non-commercial organization that occupied the theatre like a ghost. The final potential force was the modern theatre's reliance on the works of other countries. Under the control of these three forces, the British theatrical world remained silent for decades. Only after Jones emerged did he completely break away from the old shackles with a newly created style. However, who among us knows that this brave, active, and decisive man also had significant weaknesses in his personality?</p>
<p>Recently, Jones's daughter, Mrs. Sonia, compiled a biography of her father, in which she tells us a great deal about the peculiar personality of this great playwright. She tells us that Jones often lacked sensitivity, often held deep prejudices, and unnecessarily liked to argue with people. He quarreled with people when he was impatient, and he did not regret it when he was free. His life was like a battle array and a march. He continuously attacked some people or some events. For several years, he rebuked and scolded his old friend George Bernard Shaw, who replied to him on his seventieth birthday with a generous and kind letter.</p>
<p>He often dreamed of riding a fine horse, following General Cromwell on the Long Marston meadows, charging into battle. Because his veins contained the blood of the Welsh and Saxon peoples, he would be cruel, alert, and bold. These two different bloodlines flowed in his veins, so he often thought that his constantly hanging broadsword was a solemn prose, used to injure the sins and foolish people of his time, as well as those who promoted and encouraged these things. (Mei Yun)</p>
