<p>需要職員目的</p>
<p>經營國貨事業·不是個人的一手一足之力所能爲，是仗許多共感甘苦的職員，協同努力所致，一般服務工廠的職員，念到了這一點，應知負着何等的使命，擔着怎樣的責任呢？</p>
<p>你們須知第一在營業時候，要想到怎樣招徠主顧，怎樣推廣銷路，這便是推銷存貨使工廠有工可做，否則要你們做什麽？第二在工廠中服務，職工工徒的智力不足，理解不足，因此不但工作都不合式，連行爲常有缺點，與其事後矯正，不如在事前預爲補救。凡臨時的輔導，閒暇的指敎，都是補充他們學識經騐的不足，所以在工廠中，當一職員，彷彿是一個導師。循循善誘，必定得到廠中人全體的信仰，纔對得起社會，對得起羣衆，更對得起你們自已。</p>

<p>今年全世界之人禍。不滅於他年。而因商業衰落之故。暗中世人之受禍者。亦較他年爲烈。至於今年全世界之天災。則視他年而更有甚者。以中國而論。西北之旱荒尙未回復。而東北又告水災日本以前曾有風潮爲患。意國曾有大地震。英美德法諸國曾有大熱。而美國且有旱災。於今聖多明哥共和國。又有極大之風災。據其報告。上等之房屋。多被吹倒。橋梁電桿道路。俱被殘毁死者數百人。消息不通之處尙不在内。據調查所得。全國之人。幾無一人。不在物質或身體上受風災影響者。其災情重大亦可見矣。印度在前。已曾遇水災。而今又傳諾剛境内。江水泛漲。水高至於屋頂。糧食牲畜。悉被冲去。受害者達十萬人以外。亦一巨災也。又如倫敦華平地方。亦有多年未有之大火災。救火之車達七十架。且有救火船兩艘。鄰近之避難者。達二千人。觀火者達十萬人以上。物質上之損失。達三十萬鎊。是又火災中之可紀者。是故以今年言。不特人禍爲多事之秋。即天災亦復流行勿息。人類誠困苦矣。</p>

<h3 id="c50">肺病之原因及其醫療法 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>美國肺病防免大會秘書長花蘭德博士述</p>
<p>（一）神病之蔓延世界上之死人·凡十人中必有一患肺病者。此爲最少之數。（或猶不止此數）凡十五歲至四十五歲之間病死者。因肺病而致命。約三人而一據美國一國而言之。因肺病而死者。一年約十五萬人。故估計財政上所耗失者。每年約逾三萬萬美金之巨額。</p>
<p>（二）肺病之原因德國名醫考克博士。於一八二年考得肺病之源。確因肺中生有一種細菌。其形如桿。名曰結核菌。污穢暗濕之處。最易發生、遇日光與熱及種種消毒藥則死。結核菌乾之。可久而不死。人身爲結核菌寄生之地頗宜。於肺尤甚。患肺病者。所咳出之痰中。有無數結核菌。痰乾。則結核菌與灰塵共遊離於空氣之中。人呼吸時。遂自口鼻入肺。如人體適合其境况。則該菌即寄生。該菌發生之法。乃一分爲二。二分爲四。故其數之增加。極神速。肺中結核菌蔓生。則生一種塊。是日肺結核。肺結核腐爛。則挾數千萬之結核菌而排出體外。細菌生長之時。更發一種毒質。此毒人人之全體。使人發熱而荏弱。呈肺病之一切現象。</p>
<p>（三）天然抵制病菌之方法造物備有抵拒病菌之法。入口　時。有被阻而逐出者。在體内。有被細胞所尅制。而即消滅者。有爲淋巴液所制而無害者。故尋常人身中天然抵制病菌之法。已足使之無立足地。而不能發生。惟人之體氣欠佳時。則天然抵制之法。功用有缺。而病菌遂得發生。</p>
<p>（四）肺病爲傳染病患肺病者之呼氣中。未嘗含有病菌。惟吐痰噴嚏。及别種排泄物中含之。病菌必入人之身内。而後能致疾。故患肺病者之一切排泄物。均須消滅。是爲至要。其所吐之痰尤甚。凡染肺病者。大率俱因痰中所挾之結核菌也。故患此病。而能自知戒忌。則可不害人。惟無知妄行之病人。則爲傳染之源耳。</p>
<p>（五）肺病非遺傳病此說已經生般醫家考定。衆意僉同。肺病者之兒女。易患肺病。因其所居之處多有病菌也。肺病者之兒女。體氣大率柔弱。故易爲病菌所侵。肺病者之子女如能居於無病菌之空氣中。則可不患此病。</p>
<p>（六）養成肺病之境地居處不講清潔。則病菌易生。居室臥室黑暗污穢，居人過密。大市中貧戶叢集之處。病菌最多。患肺病者已居之室。如不用完密之消毒法。則經多年之後。尙有病毒肺病者。央室病也。故滌除居處。最要之保安法。凡足以滅弱人身之事。　俱助病菌之生長。缺少新鮮空氣。爲致肺病之大源。於臥室尤有關係。飮食不精。運動不足。酗酒縱慾。缺眠多勞俱損人之精神。故俱足以引起肺病。</p>
<p>（七）肺病防免法首宜注意者。卽在除去痰唾隨意吐痰。爲害最大。家庭私室及公衆之處。俱不當吐痰於地。有人未現肺病之狀。然其痰中每有挾無數肺病菌。自知患肺病。更當切戒吐痰於地。必備置痰盂。内加消毒之藥。或吐於紙巾有巾内。用後燒燬。焚除爲滅痰第一善法。人人俱宜。時時有新鮮之空氣。以防免肺病之相侵。臥室之中。窗宜恒開不閉。節欲養身。以培元氣。是爲治本之計。有咳嗽不止消瘦失肉等現象。急宜調治。不可怠忽。有病當就明醫診治。勿妄施藥石。輕聽人言。</p>
<p>（八）肺病爲可治症病方初起。而能合法調治。大率可愈。治法以空氣新鮮。食物精美。居處安適。爲首要。尤不可無嚴密照料之人。</p>
<p>（九）餘論統世界而計之。肺病已在漸衰滅之勢。卽如美國紐約一市言之。二十年來。因肺病而死亡者。已减三分之一。如合衆力。而用善法。則此害不難除盡。現今文明各國。俱有志士。合羣以研究抵制此惡症之方法。蓋除肺病。卽普世講求衛生之一方面也。凡有識之士。於是等事。必當協力贊成。</p>
<p>（美國肺病療養院創立者德爾特博士）</p>
<h3 id="c51">肺結核病之最新化學療法 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>蓋肺結核（即肺癆）之原因是結核菌。而此菌一入人體内。則於該處。便成結節。以斷血行之路。又結核菌能分泌一種抗酸性蠟質。包圍其體。以防禦一切外來藥力之侵人。故雖用種種殺菌藥。内服或注射。終不能達其病菌之實體内。歷來醫家所慣用之自然　法，對症療法，理學的療法，血清療法，藥劑療法，及其他一切治療法等。尙未完全成功。而肺病無藥之說。遍滿於一世者。因未知此深奥學理故耳。由此現代結核學者。根據上述之學、理。繼續研究。不　餘力。結果竟成此殺盡肺癆菌之化學聖劑。名日三那星Ｓanosin此藥係遵肺癆菌發明者德國考克博士與肺癆菌脫蠟術發明家德國栢格爾博士之最新醫理而發明成功者。據現下德國瑞士及其他各國諸肺病療養院之實驗報告。此藥有滲透肺病　之之結節及溶解蠟質之作用。兼具有殺菌力。能根治一二三期之肺癆。確有萬試萬　之特效。在中國。業經國民政府中央衛生試驗所化騐。藥性和平無毒。絶無任何副作用。</p>
<p>茲略舉醫治作用於下</p>
<p>（一）股於試驗管中。實驗「三那星」之藥力作用。則一分鐘後。結核菌皆消失其抗酸性。至三分鐘後。則此肺結核菌。完全殺盡。無一倖免。</p>
<p>（二）依動物試騐。則發見「三那星」能滲人結核病　内。設檢查其病竈内潛伏之結核菌。則盡失其抗酸性。此足證明其蠟質之完全溶解矣。</p>
<p>（三）如患者内服「三那星」一星期左右。則立見咯痰稀釋。體熱下降等良好狀態。</p>
<p>（四）更繼續内服「三那星」達三十天至六十天以上則顯見體重增加。食慾激進。一切症狀。遵漸緩和。終達其回天再造之偉功。</p>
<p>奉送三那星實騐報告書及肺　　　指導書函索卽寄</p>

<p>一此行任務與人員此次北來、專爲視察本路有經此次大戰後損失情形、藉籌補救辦法、二十五日晨、由浦口隨二次票車北上、機務工務總務三處均派有專員、鐵道部另派有視察專員、計有顧問英人唐德利、技正夏全授·陳滔、張祥基·陶器良等、孫局長（鶴皐）係同日晚乘二○二次車北上、其任務爲視察路務、慰問員工、并與各軍將領磋商放還車輛、以維路運、余等一行、定於一日返浦口、局長何日歸去、尙未一定、</p>
<p>二戰後損失之槪况此次視察結果、本路滕縣以南、無甚損失、滕縣以北、如曲阜·南驛·吳村·大汶口·泗河·小汶河·大佛寺河·石店河各鐵橋、均被敵軍破壞、而尤以大汶河與泗河兩橋破壞最甚、泰安道又、係十二號最佳者、亦被破壞、其他站房器具、損失亦多、以界首站爲最甚、員司私有物品、亦蕩然一空、總計此項物質損失、約値三十萬元、而黄河鐵橋損失尙未查明、營業方面、截至今日止、約損失一百萬元、共計一百三十萬元左右、</p>
<p>三車輛之巨大損失去冬浦口之役、石友三帶去機車二十一輛、客貨車三百八十七輛、唐生智叛變、損失機車二十八輛、客貨車四百五十輛、現在因軍事關係、歸運輸司令部支配之機車二十七輛、客貨車六百輛、歸路局支配者、僅有機車七輛、貨車二十輛、客車三十五輛、兗州濟南間、尙有機車七輛、客貨車一百餘輛、多殘缺不堪、濟南以北、本路尙有機車二輛、一列平浦客車、一列普通客車、又貨車二十餘輛、聞現在北段敵方路局支配者、有機車七輛、客車二十餘輛、貨車六十七輛、軍用軍數目不明、</p>
<p>四營業狀况與收支截至今日止、本路僅有浦口兗州間每月開行之一·二次客車兩列、同日開行之二○一·二○二次車兩列、而一·二次車、·尙須時常運少數傷兵回浦口、運治愈傷兵赴徐州、每日收入、不過七八千元、每月不過二十一萬元、而開支每月須二十八萬元、收支不敷者七萬元、若通車到濟、每月開支須四十萬元、收入仍不到三十萬元、不敷仍巨、如軍隊方面能撥回八列車、以濟貨運、則每日可增收五六十萬元、出入相抵、即有盈餘、但能否辦到、尙無把握、</p>
<p>五將來之整理計劃本路千孔百瘡、整理談何容易、目前治標辦法、先向各軍接洽放還車輛、以維客貨兩運、局長此來、即爲與韓總指揮磋商此事、至根本整理、非戰事解决無從著手、損壞之橋梁、必須於明年夏季以前修妥、以免水大無法收拾、黄河橋破壞程度、尙在不明、擬與軍方接洽、明日先往視察、能否辦到、亦未可知、</p>
<p>旋愚又訪津浦局長孫鶴皐氏、據談、此次北來、爲慰問全路員工、視察沿路戰後損失、與大汶河鐵橋修理工程、該橋敵人破壞太甚、幸員工努力、業已修復、三月以來、本路因戰事關係、貨運全停、奄奄一息之一二次票車、與平浦通車、亦賣票甚少、路局借貸爲生、已負債八十萬元、長此以往、前途不堪設想、現在最大毛病、一爲車輛大半供軍運、客貨運幾至全停、一爲在此軍事期間、車上亂無秩序、路局無權稽查、關於前者、現正與各軍將領交涉、軍用車一日不用、即撥歸路局應用、昨見韓總指揮接洽、尙無甚結果、關於後者、則非即日由路局嚴格稽查行旅、不能維持路上秩序、黄河橋現在破壞程度、不過僅將日前新修理之頂橋枕木焚燬、將以前拆下之橋上原有材料運回重行按置即可、修理尙不甚難、但橋之北首尙有敵軍、將來彼退却時如再破壞、則修理甚難矣、（八月三十日）</p>

<p>我國之外交人才。類多喪權失地。能折衝樽爼。顧全國體者已不多覯有遠大眼光。顧及世界局勢爲深遠之謀者。我於前輩中得一姚子梁先生。</p>
<p>姚子梁先生。爲滬瀆老紳。稔之者必不乏人。而其留歐時之一段外交史料。或爲吾國人士所不悉。僕與先生爲葭莩親。曾親聞之先生。先生壯年隨洪文卿星使游歐。文卿雖大魁天下。而於世界大勢。實無所知。先生研習經濟。復耽輿地及縱横家言。時德相畢士麥當國。普法之戰。方告終了。德國一躍而爲歐西强國。而畢氏之眼光。已洞達趨勢。德人之孟晉。必遭各國之忌。而爲世界大戰之導火。德人之科學製造。固無所畏懼。而地狹民稠。生產原料。必感不足。欲聯合一國力充實之友邦以資相助。適先生與畢氏邂逅柏林。先生亦以弱肉强食。處競存之世界。必須結一强鄰以爲外援。與畢氏縱談天下事。英雄所見略同。畢氏即提議中國聯盟之機。其策由德國供給製造人才。在中國設立工廠。製造各種戰爭利器。由德供資本。由中國供原料。即以出品爲中德二國整頓軍備之用。將來德國即以全力控制西方。以防法人之報復。中國即控制東方。以期互相援助。先生以德人此舉。實出至誠。蓋德人欲控制全歐。對東方實無暇作侵略之想。此舉猶之資人之力。利人而益已。决無惡意。欣然大喜。唯以恐各國干涉爲言。畢氏又言如國際方面不便合作。可用兩國商業資本。訂立合同。爲商業合作。而内幕則係政府主動。可無問題。先生大快。以告軺使。洪氏以茲事體大。不敢决。乃電告中樞。時高陽李相國秉政。亦不敢自專。據以上聞。清帝亦以事過冒險。議遂寢。先生得電。不怡者累日。以語畢相。畢相亦徒呼負負焉。近日英日帝國主義。日事侵略。我國乃爼上之肉。任人宰割。德人主料以歐戰失敗。一蹶不振。而其致敗之原因。仍爲原料缺乏所致也。而段氏乃以參戰借欵之故。不惜聯協約與德宣戰。試問除犧牲數萬華工。負債三千萬外。有何成績可言。雖南方孫中山先生力主反對。卒歸無效。於以知畢氏目光之遠到。而子梁先生之外交手段。較之近日之外交家。其相去果何如。</p>

<p>— 陳元良</p>
<p>四川發現二百五十三歲老人。消息傳播。無遠弗届。海上畫報。且有覓得其照片刋載報端。閱者亦多以一覩爲快。</p>
<p>惟以關山遙隔。關於此老之音訊。久無所聞。未知猶在人間否也。近有蜀籍某名律師。新自里門返滬。道老人近况甚詳。爰筆如次。繫念之者。當可釋然矣。</p>
<p>緣某律師家居萬縣。近以省親返蜀。而老人則寓開州。路隔匪遙。惟因舊有姻婭。故特迎之來家。盤桓五日。寢食與俱。察其究竟。并詢其長壽之方。據云老人係遜清康熙中葉年間人。本貴州籍。出身寒微。年十三。即出門採藥。入深山。出叢林。虎豹猛獸。無不遍見。瀕於死者。不知若干次矣。曾經過陜西甘肅内外蒙古及新疆等處。祁寒炎暑。艱苦備嘗。繼至開州。以年高力衰。遂家焉。平時飯食如常人。飢則飽啖。不飢恒數日不食。睡則蜷曲如弓。睡量淡多。有時徹夜不寐。則屹坐牀中。如老僧之入定。有時疲倦而睡。量反超過常人。惟坐則必端正。無欹斜偃伏等狀。古語所謂坐如鐘者是也。惟老人行動。却又極緩。宛如舊式戲劇文官出塲之台步焉。指甲甚長。環繞有致。取物極感不便。老人雖幼年少敎育。顧天性聰頴。閱歷至多。對於藥性之溫燥。人體之寒熱。以及氣候之轉移。極爲明瞭。病者詢問。常能一藥而愈。人恒感之。據云長壽無方。惟覺有生以來。胸襟坦蕩。不問榮辱。飢則食。渴則飮。待人接物。無疾言厲色耳。今蜀人臆測。如此高年之老者。在世界亦屬罕聞。遑論中國。實爲國瑞。此老明藥性。能治病。且又飮食隨遇。與世無爭。故超然於科學文明之外。而獨享大年。或謂老人採藥時。得延年益壽之珍品食之。故有飄飄欲仙之態。其然豈其然乎。某律師初擬挈之來滬。奈老人不慣舟車勞頓。并厭海上塵囂。力辭而罷云。</p>

<p>越昨家母舅自故鄉蒞婁。言及一雷殛奇聞。雖涉迷信。亦足使奸宄之徒。聞而失箸。故不憚詞費。表而出之。</p>
<p>上月某日。秋熱特甚。午後陰霾甫合。移時即大雨傾盆。而雷電霹靂。復與滂沱之雨而並作。其時丹陽某鄉。有農婦三兩。方戽水河干。灌漑田禾。因雨驟至。未及趨避。於是一聲霹靂。諸農婦遂以被殛聞矣。事後調查。實僅殛斃一人。其餘諸婦。均未被殛自言當霹靂猝作時。即被震暈倒。祇覺硫磺之氣。充實鼻觀。迨醒後啓視。已匍匐於丈餘路外。惟某姓婦。獨被殛斃。已焦頭爛額僵臥於戽水車畔。鄉人奇之。咸謂諸婦同在一處。而雷神僅殛一人。且令未死諸婦。於不知不覺間遠離其地。其中必有因果。越數日。鄉人復宣稱該婦（即被雷殛之農婦之夫。已自白其婦之罪孽於衆。謂婦素涎其弟之產。其弟授室已久。至今不育。婦以爲將來承襲遺產者。必已子承祧。詎去歲弟婦忽受孕。今春臨蓐。婦乃陽作助產。陰施毒計。乘產兒呱呱墜地時。即揑破其腎囊。產兒被揑立斃。婦即佯主言们弟婦。謂產兒墜地即死。弟婦信之。僅自傷命蹇而已。今被雷殛。必天譴之耳。此語雖近穿鑿。但言者諄諄。且出諸其夫。或柺徵信。然則世之慣施陰惡技倆者。鑒於此事。儻亦知所警惕乎。</p>

<p>▲誌胡調博士　自有聲電影作。歌舞影片盛極一時。（麗娃栗妲）開放最早。稱此中魁首。琵琵但妮兒之名。因以洋溢世界。而片中之二滑稽明星韋勒與華爾山。亦大爲世人所稱道。二人本著名伶工。曾在齊格飛氏所排之（麗娃栗妲）舞台劇中任此二角。凡歷三年之久。故駕輕就熟。彌覺勝任愉快也。最近雷電華公司鑒於二人之受人歡迎。因摧爲主角。攝製“Cuckoos”（胡調博士）一片。其滑稽突梯。尤勝於昔。并佐以清歌妙舞十餘種。用爲點綴。復以天然彩色煊染之。極富麗矞皇之致。在美開映時。轟動全國。衆口交譽。茲聞此片已爲大華飯在店露天影戲塲所得。即晚公映。已凉天氣未寒時。大可一娛耳目也。（平）</p>

<p>— 黎六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>但此時在北京之耶蘇派神父威畢耶（Verbiest）因對於天文學上有所貢獻。得恢復自由。且於一六六九年四月一日被任爲天文台長。因此耶蘇派不旋踵間又恢復以前勢力。而多米尼加派則於羅馬作不利於法國及耶蘇派之宜傳。其時在巴黎包圍法王路易十四之占塞利派（Jan　enistes）敎徒。亦恐耶蘇派在華成功。其勢力侵入法國宮内。於已派前途不利。因是痛毁之當時出入凡爾賽行宮之人。幾全以孔夫子及中國禮俗爲談料。大文豪聖西門（Seint-Simon）亦曾於其所著隨　中記載此事。大要云耶蘇派認華人祀祖祭孔等爲一種文明禮俗。而其他敎派則認爲迷信認爲偶像崇拜。紛紛辯駁不已。</p>
<p>在北京之耶蘇派旣知此問題在羅馬巴黎等處形勢之嚴重。遂决定清主录熙帝及中國大臣等表示意見。一七○○年十一月三十日康熙帝宣言耶蘇派之解釋爲正當。但羅馬敎廷以崇拜偶像之中國天子之證言爲不足信。敎皇克雷蒙十一世（Clement　XI）竟於一七○四年十一月二十日下令肯定中國禮俗非文明禮俗。乃一種迷信。但此令並未公佈。僅秘密發交敎皇駐華特使都爾侖（Mgr　de　Tournon）而已）</p>
<p>又經過無竊周折。一七○六年八月二日康熙帝召見兩派代表於熱河行宮。許兩派代表各以其爭執之點當面辯論。隨後由康熙帝親予仲裁。大略云一中國之（天）即天主敎之（上帝）。二祀孔子之儀式並非一種祭祝（Cnlte）乃一種對於聖人之警禮（hommage）。三祀祖先之意與祀孔子之意同。此兩者均與天主敎之信仰無妨。</p>
<p>但康熙帝之仲裁與一九○○年之宣言同樣舞效。爭端並未因而稍息。一七○七年正月二十五日敎皇特使都爾侖且在南京宣讀一駁斥康熙帝仲裁之文件。於是康熙於四月一日下諭凡傳敎師不接受耶穌派對於中國禮俗之解釋者。即禁止其在中國傳敎。</p>

<p>起先的一個半月。翠筠生意很好。伊照那個樣子。或者可以一節工夫裏。把所欠的債。逐漸還清。没有了債。那就更爲自由。俗語所謂（有子萬事足。無債一身輕。）到了娼門中。只要改去一字。變成（有客萬事足。無債一身輕）了。那時久不通音問的伊的父親吳銀匠。也來認他的女兒了。原來翠筠頗有孝思。雖然心裏有點恨伊的父母。不該被阿秀姐把伊騙到上海來。押入娼家。但伊想到伊老父是一個老實人。全是晚娘作弄成功的。而且伊曉得阿秀姐是和晚娘通同一氣的。對於父親。伊還是可憐他的。從前不是自家身體。也用不着和父親通信。現在旣已自已可以有一點主權了。便託人寫信給父親。敎他到上海來住幾天。吳銀匠巴不得有此一封信。眞是（聞道請。似得了將軍令）了。但是翠筠對於伊的晚娘。却一字不提。並不敎伊隨同父親。一淘到上海來。那個晚娘。還在老頭子面前。嘰嘰咕咕。說要是當初没有阿秀姐。伊何至於有今天的一日。當初還恨煞我們咧。算是我們害了伊吃了堂子飯。害了伊的終身咧。旣然如此。現在贖身出來了以後。就不要吃堂子飯。也算掙一口氣。爲什麽還要舖房間呢。此刻倒像煞有介事了。老頭子也不去睬伊。知道女兒的信上。没有提起伊。暗暗地想。女兒到底還是邦我做爺的。及至到了上海以後。女兒便留他在生意上住。天天欵待他。知道伊父親是喜歡喝點酒的。每天請他喝酒。萬事不如杯在手。什麽天大的事。一醉以後。便没有問題。因爲翠筠没有小房子。老頭子也只好住在生意上。馬桶間裏隨便睏睏。依了翠筠的意思。大有板輿迎養之意。不敎他再回崑山的了。但是吳銀匠山野之性。處不慣那個燈紅酒綠之塲。還是要告老還鄉。翠筠給伊做了幾身衣服。也買了許多内地不大有的吃食東西。什麽什錦餅乾啊。老年人餓時點飢。什麽廣東香腸啊。預備他下酒之需。那吳銀匠回到鄉鎭上。大家很爲羨慕。眞成了一個衣錦榮龜了。可是他還不忘伉儷之情。極力爲翠筠的後母疏通。說當初阿秀姐引誘你出去。你後母也是上了伊的當。不過阿秀姐可惡是可惡。得有今日的地位。也靠了伊。又低低的告訴道。你後母的姘頭。在去年已經死脫了。</p>

<p>昨日期麥上午開盤後、各月份大致平定、與前日收價上落甚少、迨至下午開盤、因粉市又覺不振、又傳洋麥之定價已將接進、故人心又虚、買氣更寂、各月份在交易冷淡之中、亦小去一二分不等、觀此後如洋麥再廉、廠家確實抛訂、則麥價當然須受影響也、結果本月份較前日小一分、十月份小一分、十一月份小二分、十二月份小一分一月份小二分、二月份未開、現來因廠家仍擯不動、市氣呆滯、全日祗開次沙市麥六百二十包、四兩五錢七分、尙未配廠云、</p>
<h3 id="c206">糖市日糖漲風略挫 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>昨日糖市產區電訉、古巴現糖價爲一·一五六二五、比前電微跌零六二五、紐約期糖九月份價仍一·一二、十二月一·一九、比跌二分、明年三月份一·三九、五月一·三九、亦各跌一分、爪哇現糖價八·八七五、期糖九月八·八一二五、十月八·六二五、十一月八·五零、比前電僅本月份微升零六二五、餘月均無升降、公會市場劃盤、荷糖二十四號粗砂白買氣沉寂、交易寥若晨星、普通貨八兩、略高者八兩一錢、市形平而不奇、日糖市亦轉定、蓋以到貨續來、各處走化白狂漲後、類多觀望、惟大里廠盤回電不賣、故市形尙ＳＨ嘜八兩至八價八兩、後市八兩一錢二分半、能站立、Ｎ嘜初兩零五分、ＹＴ嘜八兩零七分半ＹＰ嘜八兩一錢七分半、Ｊ嘜八兩二錢七分半交易未暢、比之前日市象似已回落二分半、號盤有禎祥及錦發　號售開現貨粗砂白二千餘袋價均八兩、因總額有近二萬袋之鉅、而行方進意殊懈、故一時均未易售通云、</p>
<h3 id="c207">南北貨龍口粉又升五錢 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>▲新生晒肉二批又到</p>
<p>▲龍口粉干　前市因貨稀曾開十九兩半、惟邇日來源仍缺、故趨勢又緊、昨聞客貨又開出一批、價升二十兩、因此各行售盤一致隨增、且連日各帮走塲活潑、後市恐須再緊、</p>
<p>▲新生圓晒肉　首批業已售通、昨招商局之大昌輪由厦抵申、二批共到二十餘件、如貨高市價不致過分上落云、</p>

<p>疋頭市况、昨日仍趨上漲、棉布市塲之熱鬧、爲今庚所僅見、吉田洋行開出月華紉、彩條　、細嗶嘰等達三百餘件、均昨現墊、人心之佳、乃所罕見、大柄月華絨已開一錢九分半、中柄月華絨一錢九分二厘半、小柄一錢八分半、厚法絨昨漲五厘、達磨獅子妃色二錢六分、白二錢五分、細嗶嘰執貨者均居奇不售、同業塌意甚濃、據云三日來雖已上漲一分外、但較之下身直貢呢、直貢緞、尙賤一分左右、故一致看漲、實銷川帮亦有蠕蠕欲動之象、昨已信中進一百餘件、天津·青島·徐州·寗波等帮均頗活動、内地批發因時届秋令、亦大形忙碌、貨價大有蒸蒸日上之勢云、</p>

<h3 id="c239">廣西的民間文學 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 湯增敭</p>
<p>瞿篤仁輯</p>
<p>現今海上的各大坊間、所出版的有系統的民間文藝集、大都採自粤東、或者是遼遠的川邊、關於很偏僻的「廣西的民間文學、」尙未有所採集、所以使一般研究民間文藝的學者、竟以不能了解廣西人民的風俗與性情爲憾、最近瞿君所輯的屬於此地的民間文學活躍於我們的眼前、補足了同是中國人而不能互相明瞭各自民情的缺陷、輯者在自序裏、關於此點却述得非常的透澈、「廣西雖然也佔中國版圖底一塊、然而因爲地位偏僻的緣故吧、就一般中國人底腦海中的途程比較、涉及廣西、好像還不如湧現一個英國或美國近便得多、就是實際上、一般中國人到廣西去的也還不如到英國美國的多、廣西是和撒哈拉、南北極一類名詞一塊兒被埋藏在一般中國人底腦庫底角落裏的、」這却是很顯明的事實、因爲寄居於中心地境的人、除了本身有特别事故的以外、無目的的跑到廣西一隅去的、委實是寥若晨星的了、但也爲了被一般所埋藏的緣故、偶爾想起了它—廣西—的時候、「也就覺得有撒哈拉、南北極同樣的神秘的趣味、並且會有瘴厲漫野、苗猺成羣、青面撩牙、……種種的幻影聯着起來、「秘密的西國」這個一般中國人所加於廣西的綽號、就表示着這個意味、廣西因地位的偏僻、被國人埋藏了、又因一向被埋藏了的緣故、被國人感到了神秘的趣味、於是廣西又有被國人從腦庫底角落裏從新搰掘出來加以研究的傾向、」這委實是一種極形好的現象、所以我們研究各地所遺留於今的民間文學、最先須從這些不易常到的邊境所有的民間實庫爲發掘的起點、這也是「一般」的槪念、往往在中國眼底以爲難以取得的東西總是特異的珍貴、所謂文學、當然也復如此、實際上、這種槪念並不錯誤、或許說是從經騐中所體會來的、</p>
<p>輯者非常的細心、將本書的内容共分爲六輯、第一輯和第二輯都是關於戀愛的、因爲在第二輯上「性」的意味比較重一點、所以輯者不憚麻繁的又把它特闢一欄、即是分爲「戀愛」上、與「戀愛」下兩輯、第三輯「婦女、」是描寫婦女生活的、第四輯「農民、」是描寫農村生活的、第五輯是「童謠、」第六輯是「雜類、」這樣有系統的分類、也可以算是本編的僅見、使讀者歌頌起來、感着分外的便利、很明白地體會到内容的所述、例如、—</p>
<p>哥有心來妹有心、</p>
<p>那怕山高水又深、</p>
<p>山高還有人行路、</p>
<p>水深還有渡船人、</p>
<p>這樣富有明白樸質美的戀歌、而且其中含蓄着深刻的寓意、在普通所出版的一情歌集中、委實是不易多見、眞是一首優美而動人好歌、</p>
<p>從這個集子裏、我們看見廣西人的心理、去時代是很遠、大槪是因爲交通不便、新思潮不能普遍的輸入、所以到現在、還保持一部分陳舊的思想、如—</p>
<p>玫瑰花開玫瑰香、</p>
<p>搖搖擺擺上學堂、</p>
<p>夫呀夫、</p>
<p>好好做文章、</p>
<p>路上有花莫要採、</p>
<p>自已房中有海棠、</p>
<p>由此、我們可以看出廣西婦女對於男子的期望心、這首詩雖然是寫「情」的、但是其中還縱横着向上的意識、促使所愛的人發奮努力、但努力的目的、還是想丈夫做一個狀元郎而已、但這種觀念、也未可一槪而論、如—</p>
<p>相公不必把口誇、</p>
<p>幾個讀書享榮華、</p>
<p>我夫雖是農家子、</p>
<p>早在田間暮在家、</p>
<p>這一首情歌又代表廣西婦女另一種心理、這種心理也是爲了中國是個重農的國家、所以從最古代遺留到現今、還是一個信仰農家生活的槪念、在這集「民間文學」中、關於這類的描寫却特别的多、又如、</p>
<p>眞可憐、</p>
<p>床上無被蓆無邊、</p>
<p>也没柴米共油鹽　　魚肉無見面、</p>
<p>人人來拜年、</p>
<p>孩兒來喊娘、</p>
<p>肚裏苦黄連、</p>
<p>這一首歌、完全表露着廣西人民經濟力的薄弱、是如此的、使我們聽之而被感動、這即使「民間文學」所特具的價値了、</p>
<p>憂去憂來憂更憂、</p>
<p>時時防盜未常休、</p>
<p>夜則守更日守望、</p>
<p>願聞早唱太平歌、</p>
<p>讀者大都會知道、廣西的盜匪眞多得有如亂麻、就是這般貧弱的農民也見之有所心悸、但又缺乏自治自衛的能力、這是事實、祗要我們歌吟了這首「願聞早唱太平歌」的希望的呼聲、確可深信無欵了、同時、他們達到了「割禾期」、是如何的喜氣洋洋、這顯然是在「苦難」中看見了光明一樣、「六十月天割禾期、夫妻出門笑嘻嘻、我做打嘑你做割如今不畏兒荒飢」、在這樣的環境之下、喚發出有如上列的歌聲、當然是必然地事實、</p>
<p>關於「童謠」、也有許多是値得歌頌的、現今也徵引一兩首、以供同好、</p>
<p>月亮光光、</p>
<p>照入大嫂房、</p>
<p>大哥讀書到半夜、</p>
<p>大嫂劈麻到天光、</p>
<p>在兒童的感官中、深印着這樣的男勤讀、女勤織的意識、這也是値得考慮的、還有許多「童謠」、終因爲幅篇的關係、未能全部的徵引爲憾、</p>
<p>最後的一輯爲「雜類」、也有多首眞情流露的好歌、祇有讓讀者自已去鑑賞了、</p>

<p>The Purpose of Needing Staff</p>
<p>Operating a national goods business cannot be done by one person alone. It requires the concerted effort of many like-minded staff who share the joys and hardships. When general factory staff think of this, they should know what kind of mission they bear and what kind of responsibility they shoulder.</p>
<p>You must know that first, when doing business, you must think about how to attract customers and how to expand sales. This is to promote the sale of inventory so that the factory has work to do. Otherwise, what do we need you for? Second, when serving in the factory, the intelligence and understanding of workers are insufficient. Therefore, not only is the work not up to par, but there are often shortcomings in behavior. Rather than correcting them afterward, it is better to remedy them beforehand. Any temporary guidance or leisurely instruction can supplement their lack of knowledge and experience. Therefore, when one is a staff member in a factory, it is as if one is a mentor. Instilling good advice step by step will surely gain the trust of everyone in the factory, be worthy of society, be worthy of the public, and even more worthy of yourselves.</p>

Since the recapture of Jinan, the main force of the Jin army has been almost completely lost. The Feng army on the Longhai line is also retreating one after another.

<h3 id="e13">Natural Disasters Around the World This Year <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The man-made disasters around the world this year will not be extinguished in other years. However, due to the decline of commerce, the suffering of the world's people in secret is more severe than in other years. As for the natural disasters around the world this year, they are even more severe than in other years. Taking China as an example, the drought in the northwest has not yet recovered, and the northeast has reported floods. Japan has previously suffered from typhoons, Italy has had a major earthquake, and Britain, the United States, Germany, and France have experienced great heat, and the United States has also had a drought. Now the Dominican Republic has had an extremely large typhoon. According to its report, most of the high-quality houses were blown down, and bridges, telegraph poles, and roads were destroyed. The places where news is not available are not included. According to the survey, almost no one in the country has not been affected by the typhoon in terms of material or physical aspects. The severity of the disaster can also be seen. India had previously encountered floods, and now it is reported that the rivers in Nuogang territory have flooded, and the water is as high as the roofs. Food and livestock were all washed away, and more than 100,000 people were affected, which is also a major disaster. In addition, there was also a major fire in Wapping, London that has not occurred in many years. Seventy fire engines and two fireboats were dispatched. As many as 2,000 people were evacuated nearby, and more than 100,000 people watched the fire. The material loss amounted to 300,000 pounds, which is another fire that can be recorded. Therefore, in terms of this year, not only are there many man-made disasters, but also natural disasters are rampant and do not stop. Humanity is truly in distress.</p>

In the future, if government agencies encounter disputes over foreign contracts, if they proceed with judicial procedures, they must not file lawsuits with foreign courts in China. Even if they have to go through legal procedures in their home country, they should also be submitted by the original contract handler or agency to the competent Yuanbu for approval, and the original handler should represent the original contract agency or file the lawsuit in the name of the agency. They must not file lawsuits in the name of the National Government or the Republic of China. The Executive Yuan has ordered its subordinates to comply. (5th Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e50">The Cause of Tuberculosis and its Treatment <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Narrated by Dr. Farrand, Secretary-General of the National Tuberculosis Association of America</p>
<p>(1) The Spread of the Disease: At least one out of every ten deaths worldwide is caused by tuberculosis. This is the minimum number (or perhaps even more). Approximately one in three deaths between the ages of fifteen and forty-five are caused by tuberculosis. In the United States alone, approximately 150,000 people die from tuberculosis each year. Therefore, the estimated financial loss exceeds 300 million US dollars annually.</p>
<p>(2) The Cause of Tuberculosis: The famous German doctor Koch discovered the source of tuberculosis in 1882. It is indeed caused by a type of bacteria that grows in the lungs. It is rod-shaped and called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is most likely to occur in dirty, dark, and damp places and dies when exposed to sunlight, heat, and various disinfectants. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can remain dormant for a long time when dry. The human body is quite suitable as a place for Mycobacterium tuberculosis to parasitize, especially in the lungs. Those suffering from tuberculosis have countless Mycobacterium tuberculosis in their sputum. When the sputum dries, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and dust float freely in the air. When people breathe, they enter the lungs through the mouth and nose. If the human body is suitable for their environment, the bacteria will parasitize. The method of reproduction of the bacteria is one dividing into two, and two dividing into four, so the increase in their number is extremely rapid. When Mycobacterium tuberculosis spreads in the lungs, it forms a mass. This is called pulmonary tuberculosis. When pulmonary tuberculosis rots, it carries tens of millions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and excretes them from the body. When the bacteria grow, they also release a toxin that poisons the entire body, causing fever and weakness, presenting all the symptoms of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(3) Natural Methods of Resisting Pathogens: Nature has methods of resisting pathogens. When pathogens enter the mouth, some are blocked and expelled. Inside the body, some are restrained by cells and immediately eliminated. Some are controlled by lymph fluid and rendered harmless. Therefore, the natural methods of resisting pathogens in the average person's body are sufficient to prevent them from gaining a foothold and developing. However, when a person's constitution is poor, the function of natural resistance is deficient, and pathogens can develop.</p>
<p>(4) Tuberculosis is a Contagious Disease: The breath of those suffering from tuberculosis does not contain pathogens. However, sputum, sneezing, and other excrement contain them. Pathogens must enter the human body before they can cause disease. Therefore, it is essential to destroy all excrement of those suffering from tuberculosis, especially sputum. Most people who contract tuberculosis do so because of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis contained in sputum. Therefore, those who suffer from this disease and are aware of its danger can avoid harming others. Only ignorant and reckless patients are the source of infection.</p>
<p>(5) Tuberculosis is Not a Hereditary Disease: This has been determined by many medical experts and is a consensus. The children of those suffering from tuberculosis are more likely to contract tuberculosis because there are more pathogens in their environment. The constitution of the children of those suffering from tuberculosis is generally weak, so they are more susceptible to pathogen invasion. If the children of those suffering from tuberculosis can live in pathogen-free air, they can avoid contracting this disease.</p>
<p>(6) Conditions that Foster Tuberculosis: Pathogens easily grow in unsanitary environments. Pathogens are most abundant in dark and dirty residences and bedrooms, and where people live in close proximity, such as in crowded areas with poor families in large cities. If a room previously occupied by a person suffering from tuberculosis is not thoroughly disinfected, it will still contain pathogens after many years. The residence of the person suffering from tuberculosis is also a disease. Therefore, cleaning the residence is the most important security measure. Anything that weakens the human body helps pathogens grow. A lack of fresh air is a major source of tuberculosis, especially in the bedroom. Poor diet, lack of exercise, alcoholism, sexual indulgence, lack of sleep, and overwork all harm a person's spirit, thus all can cause tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(7) Tuberculosis Prevention Methods: The first thing to pay attention to is the elimination of sputum. Spitting carelessly is the most harmful. One should not spit on the ground in the home, private rooms, or public places. Some people do not show signs of tuberculosis, but their sputum often contains countless tuberculosis bacteria. Those who know they have tuberculosis should especially refrain from spitting on the ground. A sputum container must be prepared with disinfectant inside, or spit into a paper towel. Burn and destroy the towel after use. Burning is the best way to eliminate sputum. Everyone should always have fresh air to prevent tuberculosis infection. Windows in the bedroom should always be open. Practice abstinence and nourish the body to cultivate vitality. This is the fundamental solution. If you have symptoms such as a persistent cough, weight loss, etc., seek treatment immediately and do not neglect it. If you are sick, seek treatment from a knowledgeable doctor. Do not arbitrarily use medicine or lightly listen to others.</p>
<p>(8) Tuberculosis is a Curable Disease: If treatment is started early and administered correctly, it can usually be cured. The most important treatments are fresh air, a refined diet, and a comfortable living environment. It is also essential to have someone who can provide close care.</p>
<p>(9) Concluding Remarks: Globally, tuberculosis is gradually declining. In New York City, for example, deaths from tuberculosis have decreased by one-third in the past twenty years. If we combine our efforts and use good methods, it will not be difficult to eradicate this scourge. Today, civilized countries are uniting to research methods to combat this disease. Eliminating tuberculosis is part of a global effort to promote hygiene. All knowledgeable people must cooperate and support these efforts.</p>

<h3 id="e51">The Latest Chemical Treatment for Pulmonary Tuberculosis <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., consumption) is Mycobacterium tuberculosis. When this bacterium enters the human body, it forms a nodule at that location, cutting off the flow of blood. Furthermore, Mycobacterium tuberculosis secretes an acid-fast wax that surrounds its body to prevent the invasion of all external drugs. Therefore, although various bactericidal drugs are taken internally or injected, they ultimately cannot reach the actual body of the pathogen. The natural therapy, symptomatic therapy, physical therapy, serum therapy, drug therapy, and all other treatments traditionally used by physicians have not been entirely successful. The saying that there is no cure for tuberculosis has spread throughout the world because the profound theory behind it is unknown. Therefore, modern tuberculosis researchers, based on the above theories, continue to research without sparing any effort. As a result, they have succeeded in creating a chemical remedy that can kill all tuberculosis bacteria, called Sanosin. This drug was invented and successfully developed based on the latest medical theories of the German doctor Koch, the discoverer of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the German doctor Bergell, the inventor of the dewaxing technique for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. According to experimental reports from various tuberculosis sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this drug has the effect of penetrating pulmonary tubercles and dissolving wax, and also has bactericidal power. It can radically cure tuberculosis in stages one, two, and three. It has a definite, proven effect. In China, it has been chemically tested by the Central Hygienic Laboratory of the National Government. The drug is mild and non-toxic and has absolutely no side effects.</p>
<p>The therapeutic effects are briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) When testing the efficacy of "Sanosin" in a test tube, the acid-fast properties of Mycobacterium tuberculosis disappear after one minute. After three minutes, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis is completely killed, without any survivors.</p>
<p>(2) Animal experiments have found that "Sanosin" can penetrate the tuberculosis nidus. An examination of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis dormant in the lesion reveals that it has completely lost its acid-fast properties. This proves that the wax has been completely dissolved.</p>
<p>(3) If patients take "Sanosin" internally for about a week, they will immediately see good conditions such as sputum thinning and fever reduction.</p>
<p>(4) Continued internal use of "Sanosin" for 30 to 60 days or more will show a significant increase in body weight, an increase in appetite, and a gradual relief of all symptoms, ultimately achieving the great feat of restoring health.</p>
<p>We offer the Sanosin experimental report and tuberculosis instructions. Send a letter or ask for it immediately.</p>

Because some people slander us Muslims, accusing us of not being in agreement with the National Congress in fighting for the freedom of our motherland. These villains purely want to use us Muslims to harm the country, so we specially held a conference to shut their mouths. A few giants among the Muslims are both favored by the National Congress and flattered and colluded with by the government.

<p>Preparations for Autumn Maneuvers in Lorraine Underway</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 4th: The French army's autumn maneuvers in the mountainous area near the Italian border concluded with a review ceremony held in Modane today. General Serigny, commander of the Lyon military region, was the commander-in-chief. The goal of the maneuvers was to defend Modane and resist enemy forces attacking from the Col du Mont Cenis pass. As a result, the attacking Blue forces advanced to Modane but were eventually driven back. Neither side was victorious. Military experts from various newspapers commented on the maneuvers, mostly saying that the deployment of large armies in mountainous areas is almost impossible. They also said that the African troops performed well, but the tanks did not meet expectations. Furthermore, the autumn maneuvers in Lorraine are currently underway. This area mostly uses cavalry and other mobile units to fight because during the European War, they were mostly engaged in trench warfare and were very unfamiliar with the tactics of mobile units.</p>

<p>Severe Hurricane in Santo Domingo</p>
<p>The Entire City is in Ruins</p>
<p>Dead and Injured Lie on Top of Each Other</p>
<p>Associated Press, Santo Domingo, 4th: All disaster areas here are under martial law. The supply of electricity and running water has been completely cut off. It will take time to fully restore them. Currently, residents' rice supply is entirely dependent on well water and river water. Although the authorities have advised the public to pay attention to hygiene, an epidemic is likely to occur. According to a letter from American Ambassador Curtis, external relief is urgently needed. The deputy commander of the Padre Rico Island told people that, according to aerial surveys, the entire Santo Domingo area has been reduced to a barren land, with an estimated death toll of around 800. Seventy-five percent of residential buildings in the area have been destroyed. The hurricane is now concentrated in northeastern Cuba, but its strength has weakened and is unlikely to cause a disaster. Reuters, New York, 4th: This morning, a hurricane passed through Santo Domingo City, estimating the death toll to be 300, while 20 people have died in Dominica. The damage there is significant, and the radio station has been destroyed. The hurricane is traveling at 130 miles per hour, which shows its ferocity. Most of the high-end houses in Santo Domingo have been blown down, and some homes that were not built sturdily have been blown away. Bridges have collapsed, roads have been destroyed, and power poles have fallen. Three areas have been completely devastated. The American Red Cross has telegraphed for relief funds to alleviate hunger.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 4th: The disaster that has struck the Dominican Republic is the most tragic scene in ten years. The insane asylum has been destroyed by the wind, and the insane people who have survived the deaths and injuries are running around everywhere, increasing the chaos. The entire national army has now been dispatched to assist in everything. The president is personally handling relief efforts and has asked the American Red Cross to provide food, clothing, and medicine as soon as possible. The estimated loss in Santo Domingo City alone is worth tens of millions of US dollars. The entire city is almost destroyed. The General Telegraph Bureau is unrecognizable. The victims urgently need drinking water, and there have been many cases of desperate people looting.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 4th: The representative of the Governor of Puerto Rico flew over the disaster area of Santo Domingo and sent a telegram saying that 800 people have died, but news from the interior of the island is cut off, and the number of deaths and injuries is unknown.</p>
<p>Reuters, Santo Domingo City, 4th: There is not a single person here who has not been affected by the hurricane, either materially or physically. There will be a severe shortage of food in the coming days. News between here and other places is cut off, but the hurricane in the interior must be the same or even worse, so it is difficult to estimate the total number of deaths and injuries in the country.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 5th: Last night's fire at New Crane Wharf in Wapping, London, was watched by 100,000 people, the largest fire in London in many years. It started in a six-story warehouse storing spices. Seventy fire engines and two fireboats used 10-mile-long hoses to pump water to fight the fire, but the fire spread. 2,000 residents living near the warehouse were ordered to evacuate. After hundreds of firefighters wearing gas masks worked hard to extinguish the fire, it began to weaken. Nearby residents were only allowed to return home at midnight. Two warehouses were destroyed, with an estimated material loss of about £300,000.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 4th: Regarding the comments made by Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen in Nanjing on Wednesday concerning India's sale of silver, Reuters has learned that the British government received a memorandum in early summer stating the difficulties caused by the low price of silver to China and requesting the British government's cooperation in the Indian government's sale of silver. This memorandum was forwarded to the Indian government by the British Foreign Office, and the Indian government issued a sympathetic response. When Chinese Minister to the UK Shi discussed other matters with British Foreign Secretary Henderson this week, he also mentioned this matter. According to sources from the Chinese community in London, the Indian government's denial on September 3rd that it had sold 40 million ounces of silver to a major Chinese bank clearly refers to the recent sale, as it is known that a batch was indeed sold last week.</p>

<p>Restructuring of the Governments of Shandong and Anhui Provinces Decided</p>
<p>The National Government convened its 92nd State Affairs Meeting on the morning of the 5th. Attendees included Wang Chonghui, Tan Yankai, Hu Hanmin, Chen Guofu, and Zhu Peide, with Tan Yankai presiding. The following resolutions were passed: 1.

Resolved to promulgate the Provisional Regulations of the National Government for the Reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau. 3. Premier Tan of the Executive Yuan submitted a report regarding the establishment of Provincial Houses of Repentance within a time limit. Previously ordered to be handled, it had been instructed to be followed. Now, according to the Jiangsu Provincial Government's reply, the matter had been actively prepared by the local government in consultation with the Jiangsu Higher Court. The court's letter proposed using the old Suzhou Copper Coin Bureau as the site for the House of Repentance. The proposed budget had been reviewed and approved by the local government committee and submitted to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for verification, deeming it feasible. Regarding funding, the local government committee resolved: 1. To use 60,000 yuan from the security funds of the former Shanghai Provisional Court as start-up expenses, with the Finance Department allocating the shortfall. 2. To have the Finance Department allocate regular expenses after the establishment of the House. Instructions had been sent separately to investigate and address this matter. The report detailed the progress of the establishment of the House of Repentance, along with the submitted organizational chart and budget of the Jiangsu Higher Court's House of Repentance, requesting review. The resolution approved the report and urged the Ministry of Finance to return the aforementioned security funds of the former Shanghai Provisional Court. 4. Specially appointed Ma Fuxiang as Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. 5. Reorganized the Shandong Provincial Government, appointing Han Fuqu, Li Shuchun, He Siyuan, Wang Xiangrong, Zhang Honglie, Ma Hongkui, Liu Zhennian, Zhang Yue, and Wang Fangting as members, with Han Fuqu concurrently serving as Chairman, Li Shuchun concurrently serving as Director of the Civil Affairs Department, He Siyuan concurrently serving as Director of the Education Department, Wang Xiangrong concurrently serving as Director of the Finance Department, Zhang Honglie concurrently serving as Director of the Construction Department, Wang Fangting concurrently serving as Director of the Agriculture and Mining Department, and Zhang Shaotang as Secretary-General. 6.

<h3 id="e75">Military Situation on Both Sides of the Longhai Railway <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Jin army on the Longhai Railway has recently been making remote gestures of support for the Jin army on the Jinpu Railway, launching a full-line counterattack. Sun Dianying's troops are even more capable of making surprise attacks and disturbances. The central departments, under the command of Zhu Shaoliang, are responding in a roundabout way. The Jin army ultimately failed to succeed. Sun Dianying's troops were also jointly suppressed by the civilian corps of Shangqiu, Suixian, and Ningling counties in eastern Henan, suffering a major setback and fleeing in disarray. In the past ten days, heavy rain has fallen continuously in the front lines. The Lanfeng position is about a foot deep in water, and the trenches are flooded, making it impossible for the Jin army to defend. There are reports that they are automatically concentrating near Jixian, Anyang, and Daming, awaiting orders. The Feng army has always been unwilling to lightly damage its strength. Only in the last few days of last month, the Feng army's artillery fire in the Lanfeng area was continuous at dusk or dawn, which could be heard near Libaji. In the last two or three days, the artillery fire has subsided. (3rd)</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: Jinpu Railway Director Sun Hegao, Traffic Section Chief She Xu, Railway Ministry Inspector Chen Tao, and others came to Jinan to inspect the losses of the Jinpu Railway. Today, I visited She Xu on the train and asked about the recent situation of the Jinpu Railway. Mr. She's remarks were as follows:</p>
<p>1. Mission and Personnel of This Trip: This northern trip is specifically for inspecting the extent of the losses suffered by this railway after the recent war, in order to devise remedial measures. On the morning of the 25th, we traveled north from Pukou on the second-class passenger train. Specialists were dispatched from the Machinery, Engineering, and General Affairs Departments. The Railway Ministry also dispatched special inspectors, including British consultant Tang Deli, technicians Xia Quanshou, Chen Tao, Zhang Xiangji, Tao Qiliang, and others. Director Sun (Hegao) took the 202 train north on the evening of the same day. His mission is to inspect railway affairs, comfort employees, and consult with military generals to return vehicles and maintain railway transport. Our group is scheduled to return to Pukou on the first of the month. The Director's return date has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>2. Overview of Post-War Losses: According to the results of this inspection, there has not been much damage south of Teng County. North of Teng County, such as the iron bridges at Qufu, Nanyi, Wucun, Dawenkou, Sihe, Xiaowenhe, Dafo Temple River, and Shidian River, were all destroyed by the enemy army, especially the Dawen River and Si River bridges, which were the most severely damaged. The Taian road, which was the best on the 12th, was also destroyed. Other station buildings and equipment also suffered many losses, with Jieshou Station being the most damaged. The private belongings of employees were also completely destroyed. The total material loss is estimated to be worth 300,000 yuan, and the loss of the Yellow River Railway Bridge has not yet been determined. In terms of business, as of today, the loss is about one million yuan, totaling about 1.3 million yuan.</p>
<p>3. Huge Loss of Vehicles: During the Pukou battle last winter, Shi Yousan took away 21 locomotives and 387 passenger and freight cars. During Tang Shengzhi's rebellion, 28 locomotives and 450 passenger and freight cars were lost. Currently, due to military relations, 27 locomotives and 600 passenger and freight cars are under the control of the Transportation Command. The Railway Bureau only has 7 locomotives, 20 freight cars, and 35 passenger cars under its control. There are still 7 locomotives and over 100 passenger and freight cars between Yanzhou and Jinan, many of which are damaged. North of Jinan, this railway still has 2 locomotives, a Pupu passenger train, an ordinary passenger train, and over 20 freight cars. It is reported that the enemy's railway bureau in the northern section now controls 7 locomotives, over 20 passenger cars, and 67 freight cars. The number of military vehicles is unknown.</p>
<p>4. Business Conditions and Revenue: As of today, this railway only has two first and second-class passenger trains running between Pukou and Yanzhou each month, and two 201st and 202nd trains running on the same day. The first and second-class trains must also frequently transport a small number of wounded soldiers back to Pukou and transport cured wounded soldiers to Xuzhou. Daily income is only seven or eight thousand yuan, and monthly income is no more than 210,000 yuan, while monthly expenditure is 280,000 yuan, resulting in a shortfall of 70,000 yuan. If traffic to Jinan were opened, monthly expenditure would be 400,000 yuan, and income would still be less than 300,000 yuan, leaving a large shortfall. If the military can return eight trains to facilitate freight transport, daily income could increase by 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, which would result in a surplus after offsetting expenses. However, there is no certainty whether this can be done.</p>
<p>5. Future Reorganization Plan: This railway is full of holes and scars, so reorganization is not easy to discuss. The current temporary solution is to contact the various armies to return vehicles to maintain passenger and freight transport. The director came here this time to discuss this matter with Commander Han. Fundamental reorganization cannot begin until the war is resolved. Damaged bridges must be repaired before next summer to avoid being unable to cope with the high water. The extent of the damage to the Yellow River Bridge is still unclear. It is planned to contact the military and visit the site tomorrow. Whether this can be done is also unknown.</p>
<p>Later, I visited Jinpu Railway Director Sun Hegao. According to him, this northern trip is to comfort all the employees of the railway, inspect the post-war losses along the route, and oversee the repair project of the Dawen River Iron Bridge. The enemy damaged the bridge too severely. Fortunately, the employees worked hard and have already repaired it. Since March, due to the war, freight transport on this railway has been completely suspended. The almost dying first and second-class passenger trains and the traffic to Pingpu have also sold very few tickets. The Railway Bureau has been living on loans and is already 800,000 yuan in debt. If this continues, the future is unimaginable. The biggest problems now are that most of the vehicles are used for military transport, and passenger and freight transport has almost completely stopped. The other problem is that during this military period, there is chaos on the trains, and the Railway Bureau has no authority to inspect. Regarding the former, negotiations are currently underway with various military generals to return military vehicles to the Railway Bureau for use when they are not needed. Yesterday, I met with Commander Han, but there were no significant results. Regarding the latter, order on the road cannot be maintained unless the Railway Bureau strictly inspects travelers immediately. The current extent of the damage to the Yellow River Bridge is only that the recently repaired sleepers of the top bridge have been burned, and the original materials removed from the bridge can be transported back and reinstalled. Repair is not very difficult. However, if the enemy troops still at the north end of the bridge destroy it again when they retreat in the future, it will be very difficult to repair.

<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Every year, during the autumn and winter seasons, a large number of fishermen from various coastal counties of Fujian sail to the waters of Zhejiang to fish. However, in recent years, bandits have been rampant in the lower reaches of eastern Zhejiang. The most notorious ones include the Dongxiqi and Xiangshan Yushan groups, which are entrenched in Fengyan; the Taizhou bandit leader Li Yingshui (also known as Zhiqing); and the Niu Tou Men bandit leader Wang Luxi (also known as Feihu), who prowls around Haimen and Pishan Fengwei. They each have thousands of followers, intercepting and robbing ships at sea. Few fishermen traveling to Zhejiang escape their harm, resulting in losses of millions of yuan each year. Now that the fishing season is approaching, fishermen have no other means of livelihood and cannot simply sit and wait for death. On the 27th of last month, they specifically convened a general meeting of Fujian fishermen in Xiamen to discuss relief measures. Over 500 people attended, and three resolutions were passed on the spot: 1. To send Huang Guangkun, Lin Juemin, and others to Beijing to petition the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Naval Ministry to dispatch warships to patrol the waters of Zhejiang and suppress pirates. 2. To petition the Zhejiang Provincial Government to order local water police to search for and arrest pirates, and to effectively protect the lives and property of fishermen. 3. To issue a declaration requesting assistance from all sectors. Yesterday, the representatives set off for Beijing. (September 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e79">Zhang Xueliang Returns to Shenyang from Beidaihe <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Accompanied by Key Officials and Representatives from Various Parties</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Commander Zhang Xueliang has been at the Beidaihe seaside resort since transferring from Huludao, and it has been many days since then. Some days ago, a telegram was sent to Shenyang, stating that he would return to Shenyang after the traffic on the Beining Railway was restored. Fortunately, the Beining Railway line was barely repaired and opened to traffic by the Railway Bureau on the 29th of this month. Zhang then ordered the Railway Bureau to prepare three special trains, which departed from Beidaihe at 12:00 midnight on the 29th. All the key officials and representatives from various parties who had been stranded at the seaside with Zhang also set off at the same time, engaging in political activities. The first train was an ordinary first-class passenger car with 19 cars, for the use of the representatives and key officials. The second train was an armored train with 19 cars, for the use of the guards. The third train had a total of 13 cars and was Zhang's special car. Madame Yu Fengzhi and others were in this car. Zhang's special train was originally scheduled to arrive in Shenyang at 9:00 pm on the 30th, but the actual arrival time was 7:55 pm, earlier than the scheduled time. It is said that Zhang's special train, west of the Xinmin station, was still behind the armored train that was pressing the road, but when it reached east of Xinmin, it suddenly passed the pressing train and arrived in Shenyang earlier than the scheduled time, causing the welcoming and security aspects to be rushed. Only the key cadres rushed to welcome him at the Huanggu Tun station. When Zhang got off the train, he was dressed in casual clothes and looked very healthy. He then took a car out of the station. Four cars followed in a row. Zhang mingled with his family members and returned to his private residence in the city to rest. The other key officials also separately returned to their residences from the station. It is said that after returning to the government, Zhang intends to telegraphically summon the senior cadres of the Northeast to hold a supreme meeting to decide on the policy to deal with the current situation.

<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Belgian Foreign Minister Vandervelde, formerly the leader of the Second International Socialist Party of Europe, has come to China at the invitation of the National Government to give lectures and take the opportunity to investigate the current situation in China. Some days ago, Yang, a special representative sent by the National Government, passed through Shenyang to welcome him in Harbin. Yesterday (the 30th), Mr. Vandervelde arrived in Shenyang from Harbin. This afternoon, Northeast University Vice-President Liu Fengzhu and Dean Li Shutang, Sun Guofeng, and others hosted Mr. Vandervelde at the Zhongxin Tang Restaurant on Sanjing Road. Education Director Wu Jiaxiang, Chamber of Commerce Presidents Jin Enqi and Lu Naigeng, and others were present as guests. During the banquet, they exchanged toasts and enjoyed the occasion very much. At the end of the banquet, it was agreed that a meeting and lecture would be held at Northeast University at 10:00 am on September 1st. The topic of the lecture is (The difference between the Second International and the Third International, and their positions in the international arena). It is said that after attending the lecture, he plans to pay a visit to Commander Zhang Xueliang that day to discuss everything. At 9:00 pm, he will depart for Ping, stay for about a week, and then go south by sea to meet people in Shanghai. (31st)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Chinese Eastern Railway Borrows Money from the United States <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Electric Power Conference Council Stops Negotiations</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: After the Chinese Eastern Railway raised freight rates, business has been sluggish for the past six months. It had previously laid off employees successively, but even then, it was still difficult to pay expenses. In August, revenue decreased by hundreds of thousands compared to the same month last year. The Accounting Office and the Revenue Office reported to the director one after another that there were no funds left for September expenses. At the same time, the engineering expenses of various stations have also run out one after another. Therefore, the Railway Bureau had no choice but to borrow money to maintain operations. Recently, it has been negotiating with the American merchant Citibank to borrow between three million and five million yuan, agreeing to repay the loan when transportation flourishes in winter. The Japanese side was greatly shocked by the establishment of this loan, even suspecting that relations had developed between the United States and Russia. Recently, there has been a widespread rumor that Soviet Russia is selling the Chinese Eastern Railway to the United States, which is why this rumor has arisen. In fact, Soviet Russia is doing its best to operate the Chinese Eastern Railway, and its purpose is elsewhere. Knowing this, one should know that it will never sell it easily.</p>
<p>Recently, the Russian cadres of the Chinese Eastern Railway have been clearly divided into two factions. Director Rudyi and the directors are not on good terms, and everything is promulgated by order of the bureau without waiting for instructions. The Russian directors, in order not to show their internal strife to others, have been tolerating and not speaking out, but secretly they are increasingly fighting with each other. Last month, during the layoff incident, Yemshanov and Rudyi had a fierce dispute, which eventually led to mutual reports to the Moscow government. Rudyi said that the Russian staff of the Chinese Eastern Railway did not obey the strike order after July 10 last year and continued to serve the Chinese, so that no problems occurred in the operation of the Chinese Eastern Railway. This was disloyalty to the Soviets and should be dismissed. Yemshanov said that these people were able to maintain the Russian power of the Chinese Eastern Railway with perseverance and hardship. Although they did not strike, they monitored the actions of the Chinese and secretly communicated information, and their merits should not be denied. Directors Danilev, Belshin, and Consul Melnikov all agreed with Yemshanov's statement, but the Moscow instructions were still implemented in accordance with Rudyi's method. As a result, the Russian director carried out a large-scale layoff. Now that the dismissed Russian staff are not allowed to return to their country and are not given pensions, these ordinary Red Party members have become true Red Party members. It is said that the Soviet Russian Transportation Commission has recently ordered Yemshanov to return to his country and appointed another chairman to adjust the factions. It is expected that this will be realized soon.</p>
<p>The Chinese Eastern Railway Electric Power Conference has been completely suspended for the past month. The Special Committee has stopped meeting long ago because there is nothing to discuss. Russian Deputy Director Yemshanov has even taken his family to Japan, and his return date is uncertain. Therefore, negotiations in the Council have also been interrupted. Although Li Deyan, Director of the Postal and Telegraph Department of the Transportation Committee, has met with Russian Deputy Director Janosov many times, Janosov has stated that the Council has not yet given any orders, and the Special Committee cannot continue to be convened. Therefore, Mr. Li returned to Shenyang yesterday to ask for instructions. (August 31st)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Wuhu Quick Letter <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Provincial Government Chairman Ma Fuxiang arrived in Wuhu this morning at 7:00 on the Anfeng gunboat from the province. After stopping briefly, he summoned the city's Public Security Bureau Director and the Rice Donation Bureau Director, among others, to board the ship for consultation. He then departed for Beijing.</p>
<p>The Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce opposes the relocation of the rice market to the capital. Yesterday, it sent separate telegrams to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting the cancellation of the Preparatory Office for the Nanjing Rice Market, and telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government, requesting it to make a strong case. Today, it sent detailed submissions to various departments of the National Government, stating the importance of the rice market to the agricultural, industrial, and commercial relations of Anhui Province, as well as its connection to provincial treasury and national taxes, and expressing reasons why it cannot be moved. It also issued a declaration, asking all sectors to provide unified assistance.</p>
<p>The Sixth District Bandit Suppression Command executed four bandits captured in Fanchang at 2:00 pm today by binding them and shooting them at the Thirteenth Gate. They were identified as Wang Maosheng, Wang Zhaoting, Hu Guangtong, and Qiang Kezhao.</p>
<p>The Preparatory Office for the Wuhu Municipal Government was planned to be abolished by the Provincial Government, but after the Director Shao Yizhou went to the province to argue strongly, the Provincial Government has not yet decided on a solution. It has now submitted a request to the National Government for verification. However, the Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce believes that since the establishment of the office, there have been no achievements, but many new donations have been created, which merchants and the public cannot afford. Yesterday, it specifically telegraphed the Provincial Government, requesting that the various exorbitant taxes newly created by the office be ordered to stop in order to alleviate the suffering of merchants.

<p>Strange Assassination Case: Tang He Long Oil Cake Shop on the Tang He Long Oil Cake Shop on the Xiwai Kuatang Bridge was opened by Tang Zhigao and his brother Yutian with a joint investment of 10,000 yuan. The business was doing well and had profits every year. Yutian was in full charge of the shop. His wife had died early, and he was 65 years old. His residence was behind the shop. Unexpectedly, at around 1:00 am on the 5th, a violent thug suddenly appeared. At the time, all the employees in the shop were asleep, except for a certain apprentice, who heard Yutian cry out that he had something to say, followed by a cry for help. The apprentice immediately got up and saw someone walking out of Yutian's room, with one foot wearing a straw sandal and the other foot bare. He was holding an electric lamp and could not see his face clearly. He immediately shouted to catch the thief. The thug covered the apprentice with a small square table and escaped through the back door. The employees in the shop woke up in shock and rushed to chase him, but there was no trace of him. They returned to check on Yutian and found him lying in a pool of blood. After checking, no cash or silver objects were lost. This morning at 6:00 am, they reported to the authorities. At around 10:00 am, Prosecutor Zhu and the inspectors inspected the scene and found six knife wounds on the body, two of which were fatal: one in the throat and one in the heart. Judging from this assassination, it seems that there was an old feud. It is unknown whether the truth will be revealed. It should be noted that the shop's foundation is very wide. The shop faces south, east to the Da Dong Tang, and west to the Huayuanbang. Behind the shop are the Wu Garden and Bamboo Garden. Outside the surrounding wall, there are the walls and houses of neighbors, so there seems to be no way to enter, and no footprints can be found. The only way out is from the west side of the back garden. There are many footprints on one side. From the deceased's bedroom to the back door (the iron lock was twisted off), passing through more than a dozen doors, there was no accidental wandering in the dark, and he escaped calmly. This seems impossible for someone who is not familiar with the doorway.</p>
<p>Qibao Robbery Case: One Bandit Killed. Xu Fangshi's house in the 25th Tu of Qibao West was robbed by dozens of bandits speaking a local dialect at 11:00 pm on the 3rd. They carried box guns and opened the main door by climbing over the roof and entering from the front. They first fired a shot, and the servant Wang Agou was shot and fell to the ground. The remaining bandits entered and looted recklessly. The owner urgently fired a self-defense quick gun, killing one bandit on the spot. The bandits panicked and fired back while retreating. They left through Hengtang Port. The dead bandit was about thirty years old. In addition to sending the injured servant to Songjiang Hospital to have the bullet removed, they reported to the local sub-station and forwarded the report to Songjiang. The prosecutor of the County Court is now conducting an inspection in the countryside.</p>
<p>Continued Report on the Inspection of the Hu Surname Murder Case: Yesterday afternoon, the prosecutor went to the countryside to open the coffin and inspect the Hu surname murder case at the Da Wu Bridge. The plaintiffs invited doctors Ke Deqiong and Zhang Shaoxiu to observe the inspection. According to the court's inspector Tao, there were finger marks on the throat, the skin of the occipital bone was scratched, and there were green marks on the arms. The doctors' inspection report has not yet been sent to the court, but according to the news from the doctors, the marks on the neck were rotten, there were no bite marks on the heels, and there were death spots on the back. This can be determined to be a death while lying down. No other significant traces were found.</p>
<p>Bidding for Two Major Bridge Construction Projects: The First District Office recently held a public bidding for the Xibaidu Bridge in the Xibaidu industry today at the District Office. Xie Hongji Construction won the bid for 2,605 yuan, three jiao, and three fen. Zhu Bingji won the bid for Xiunan Bridge for 1,481 yuan, two jiao.</p>

<p>Another Request to the Provincial Government to Abolish the Night Soil Collection Sector: Citizen Jiang Yuanqi and others previously submitted a request to the provincial government to abolish the night soil collection sector and establish a sanitation bureau for management, with the surplus funds used to subsidize education and construction expenses. The provincial government instructed the county to review and deliberate, and the county government meeting decided to temporarily retain the night soil collection sector. Jiang argued that night soil collection is not comparable to business operations. Moreover, an investigation of the Night Soil Guild's report showed that the annual income was 490,000 yuan, while the city had 960 night soil carriers paying a monthly fee of six jiao, totaling only 6,912 yuan, a significant discrepancy. Therefore, he requested the provincial government to order the county to abolish it. The provincial government considered the submission to be worthy of adoption and specifically ordered the county to investigate and handle the matter yesterday.</p>
<p>Huang, the County Magistrate, Commanded by the Department of Finance to Raise 250,000 Yuan in Treasury Bonds: County Magistrate Huang, following an order from the Department of Finance, is to raise 250,000 yuan in customs duty treasury bonds. Yesterday, another telegram ordered the convening of local representatives from all sectors to discuss fundraising measures, and to allocate the full amount of two yuan collected in addition to this year's grain tax commutation to offset the loan. The deadline for responsible remittance is September 15.</p>
<p>Robbery Occurs in Fei Jia Bang: Fei Jia Bang, located five li from Lishu Town, was suddenly attacked by two pirate ships (on the 4th) night. More than twenty pirates, each wielding weapons, stormed the home of He A'gen in Village 7, robbing two shi of white rice and one gold bangle. The Third Police Station dispatched officers to pursue the bandits, but they were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Verdict Scheduled for Youth Student Reactionary Case: Wang Yaochen, a police officer at Post No. 2548, Sixth District, Municipal Public Security Bureau of Caojiadu, apprehended Zhou Zhiyi, a young student distributing anti-revolutionary leaflets near the intersection of Rue Robert and Wujiao Road on June 23 of this year. Furthermore, the chief police officer of the First Sub-station on Rue Robert apprehended He Yijin, Tu Jingjie, Lin Jie, and Peng Peixiang, young students shouting reactionary slogans, and Li Shunfa, a twelve-year-old elementary school student. All five were transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for review. Recently, they were transferred to the High Court. Yesterday (the 5th), Judge Zheng Chi of the Second Criminal Tribunal presided over the hearing and summoned police officer Wang Yaochen and detective Su Xin to court for questioning. The court appointed lawyer Qu Xin'chang to provide pro bono defense and declared the hearing concluded, with the verdict scheduled for the 11th of this month.</p>
<p>Liu Run'shen Applies to Contract the Barber Donation: Liu Run'shen and others submitted a request to the county government to contract the barber donation, proposing to collect the donation in three grades: Grade A, 1.2 yuan per chair per month; Grade B, 8 jiao; and Grade C, 4 jiao. The contract period is one year, with a monthly deposit of 500 yuan, totaling 6,000 yuan. Liu and others will first pay two installments of 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Plans to Open a Circular Road Around the City: The Bureau of Construction plans to open a circular road around the city, starting from the endpoint of Fengmen, passing through Loumen and Fengmen, and reaching the North Road Bridge in Qimen. It will then be divided into two lines, one directly to the train station and the other to Lu Mu Town, approximately twenty English miles in length. The estimated cost is over ten thousand yuan. There are over a dozen bridges in the middle, requiring a cost of two hundred thousand yuan. It is proposed to levy a fee from all shops in the county to be collected on behalf of the construction, following the method of conscripting labor for road construction.</p>

He suddenly beat Xiao Zhou. After being beaten, Xiao Zhou went to his relative Jiang Meimei's place and sought treatment from Wang's injury clinic, but it was ineffective. He died at 11:00 AM on the 4th. The local public security sub-station reported to the county government for an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that the deceased, Xiao Zhou, had his abdomen overturned and died from the injuries. The death certificate was filled out, and Jiang Guilin, the manager of the shop, provided a coffin for burial. The murderer, Fan, fled without a trace upon realizing the trouble he had caused.

<p>Anti-Smuggling Team Returns to Wuxi After Suppressing Bandits: A large number of salt smugglers recently arrived in Wan Shan Dang, at the border of Suzhou and Wuxi, and opened fire with the Seventh Anti-Smuggling Brigade stationed in Wuxi, killing and wounding several officers and policemen. The anti-smuggling team bravely pursued and killed one bandit leader. The bandit crowd scattered in all directions. At 8:00 PM the day before yesterday, the anti-smuggling team was patrolling near the South Dragon King Temple in Xiasi, near Lili, when they encountered smugglers. They immediately stepped forward to arrest them. The smugglers opened fire to resist arrest, and the anti-smuggling team also opened fire. They fought in the lake for several tens of minutes. The smugglers were outnumbered and defeated, fleeing towards Zhejiang. One bandit boat and one quick-firing gun were captured. Yesterday, Captain Wu of the anti-smuggling team led his troops and boats back to Wuxi.</p>
<p>Yu Qi Boat Robbed Again: A boat from Yuqi Town in the Sixteenth District (Qingcheng City) of the county set sail from the city back to town at around 8:00 PM last night. Unexpectedly, when it reached the Mopan Dun area of Fengzhuang, it was suddenly met by three or four dragon boats. More than ten bandits jumped out of the boats, carrying weapons such as pistols, knives, clubs, and flashlights, and ordered the boat to stop. The boatmen dared not resist and had to stop the boat. The bandits jumped aboard and ransacked the cabins, thoroughly searching the boat. The male and female passengers on the boat were also searched. After half an hour, they left fully looted. It is estimated that over 900 yuan in cash and a box of tin foil were robbed. Afterwards, the Fengzhuang Chamber of Commerce heard the news and pursued them, but the bandits had already fled far away and could not be caught.</p>
<p>Suzhou-Wuxi Telephone Line Scheduled to Open: The long-distance telephone lines of nine counties in Jiangsu Province, including Jiangning, Zhenjiang, and Wujin, have already been connected. Recently, Director Sun of the Department of Construction, considering the commercial development of Suzhou and Wuxi counties, deemed it necessary to connect long-distance telephone lines and specifically instructed Deng Fupei, Director of the Electrical Management Office, to start planning. It is now known that the office has decided to start construction on the Wujin to Wuxi section within days and it can be completed by the end of October. After the Changzhou-Wuxi connection is completed, work will begin on the Wuxi to Suzhou section. This phase of the project is expected to be completed by the end of November.</p>
<p>School Thief with Devious Methods Apprehended: Recently, the Wuxi Provincial College of Education and Wuxi Provincial High School cracked a major theft case. The incident is peculiar and interesting. The process of cracking this case is described below. On the 30th of last month, the Wuxi Sheqiao Provincial College of Education opened its term. Within half an hour, the student dormitories lost long gowns, watches, and other items. The teachers' dormitories had chests and baskets broken open, and money, Western suits, and other items were lost, totaling one or two hundred yuan in value. On the 31st, the teachers' dormitories of the school again lost Western suits, leather shoes, money, and other items. The school suffered such losses for two consecutive days, and the administrators felt uneasy. After repeatedly questioning the gatekeepers, they learned that a young man, wearing a wool serge long gown and yellow leather shoes, had been seen daily, looking very much like a student, claiming to be visiting a certain gentleman at the school. Without waiting for a greeting, he went straight to the dormitory. Therefore, the administrators suspected that this young man might have unethical behavior. They notified various schools in Wuxi to pay attention and assigned students who recognized the young man's face to guard at various schools and inquire in the streets, hoping to crack the case. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 2nd of this month, in the student dormitory of the Provincial High School, a Western-suited teenager was discovered rummaging through boxes and stealing items. They immediately captured him and telegraphed the College of Education to send someone to identify him. As a result, this Western-suited teenager was the same person who had previously claimed to be visiting a certain gentleman at the College of Education. He confessed that he committed the multiple thefts at the College of Education alone. The teenager's name is Zhang Yunxuan, 27 years old, from Luoshe, Wuxi. He habitually impersonates people in the education field to visit students or teachers at various schools, thereby stealing valuable items. The reason he knows the names of the students or teachers of various schools is that he either deceives and asks at the gate or memorizes the names marked on the dormitories, so he can sell his skills. He is indeed cunning.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education previously drafted the national education and cultural expenditure budget for the nineteenth year and consulted the Ministry of Finance for review and compilation. The Ministry of Finance stated that the second-level expenditure budget for education and culture in the nineteenth year included various agencies and undertakings. In addition to the Central Education Museum, which is a new undertaking and had no recurring expenses listed last year, the Finance Committee had reviewed and approved a total of 13,712,055 yuan at various times. The budget for this year lists recurring expenditures totaling 17,140,645 yuan, an increase of 3,428,590 yuan compared to the total amount approved last year. The recurring expenses of the Ministry of Education headquarters also increased by 108,000 yuan. Given the current financial difficulties and the huge expenditure of the national treasury, there is no room for further expansion of military and political expenses in the nineteenth year. It was specifically requested that the Central Political Conference decide whether to appropriately reduce the budget. The Central Political Conference handed it over to the Finance Group for review. According to the reply, the national education and cultural expenditure budget should be handled in accordance with the detailed rules for the nineteenth year's budget relief measures to ensure uniformity.

<h3 id="e125">Yesterday's General Meeting of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>▲ Resignation of Chinese Director Bei Songsun</p>
<p>▲ Hu Mengjia Elected as Successor</p>
<p>▲ Opposition to Water Rate Increase</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association held a general meeting of representatives yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Presided over by Wang Xiaolai, the meeting lasted two hours. Regarding the matter of Chinese Director Bei Songsun of the Municipal Council requesting to resign due to his upcoming trip abroad to study banking for six months, it was resolved to approve the request. Hu Mengjia was immediately elected to succeed him. Subsequently, the discussion focused on opposing the proposed 25% increase in water rates. The atmosphere in the meeting became tense, with numerous speakers expressing their views. Ultimately, three opposition measures were decided upon and will be actively pursued until the goal is achieved. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Meeting Circumstances</p>
<p>The meeting was originally scheduled to begin at 2:00 PM yesterday, but due to the late arrival of representatives, it was delayed until 3:30 PM. Chairman Wang Xiaolai then announced the commencement of the meeting. The representatives present were Zhang Rulin, Zou Quan, Hu Xisheng, Zou Xieqing, Fang Jiaobo (represented by Wu Yayin), Wu Yayin, Li Bohan, Sun Qiuping, Chen Tianyin, Qin Runqing, Yuan Jinchu, Yu Xiji, Xie Zhongfu, Zhang Zilian, Pan Xulun, Wang Jiean, Zhang Yichen, Lu Feibohong, Zhu Peiyuan, Hu Fengxiang, Cheng Xiechun, Lin Kanghou, Chen Tingrui (representing Lin Kanghou), Yu Zhongxian, Yan Esheng, Chen Gengxin, Jiang Yinan, Xu Yunan, Chu Huiseng, Lu Fengzhu, He Shaogeng, Yuan Ludeng, Zhao Jinqing, Hu Mengjia (represented by Xu Jiliao), Li Fusun, Wu Yunzhai, Wang Xiaolai, Sun Jingxi, Zhang Henghai, Wang Yansong, Lu Wenshao, Zhang Yichen, and Shen Tianxin. In attendance were Chinese Councilors Yu Qiaqing, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Jiliao, Qian Longzhang, representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Liu Yunfang, and representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Government Geng Jiaji. The agenda was as follows: 1. Opening of the meeting; 2. Three bows to the national flag, party flag, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's portrait; 3. Recitation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will; 4. Chairman's report on the purpose of the meeting; 5. Discussion of Director Bei Songsun's resignation from the Municipal Council; 6. Discussion of opposition to the Shanghai Waterworks Company's proposed 25% rate increase.</p>
<p>▲ Re-election of Chinese Director</p>
<p>The chairman first reported that recent discussions by the Standing Committee and Executive Committee were deemed to have no power to decide, hence the submission to today's general meeting for discussion. Yu Qiaqing then stated that Director Bei Songsun possessed extraordinary courage and quick thinking, making him an invaluable talent. If his departure from Shanghai were short-term, they would certainly make every effort to retain him. However, since his absence would last for more than six months, the voting rights of the Chinese at the Municipal Council meetings were indispensable. Losing one of them would undoubtedly have a negative impact. Therefore, for the benefit of the majority of citizens, they had no choice but to accommodate the situation and re-elect a replacement. A majority agreed, and the chairman put it to a vote, which passed unanimously. Hu Fengxiang proposed changing the agenda to immediately hold a re-election, which Chu Huiseng seconded and was unanimously approved. Qian Longzhang and Pan Xulun were appointed as vote counters. As a result, Hu Mengjia was elected as a director of the Municipal Council with 29 votes (Chen Guangfu received the second highest number of votes with seven votes). The election was signed and sealed by the government representatives Liu and Geng, as well as the vote counters Qian and Pan.</p>
<p>▲ Important Resolutions</p>
<p>Next, the discussion focused on opposing the proposed 25% increase in water rates by the Shanghai Waterworks Company. After the chairman's report and a letter from the Shanghai Real Estate Association were presented, Yu Qiaqing, Chu Huiseng, Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou, Lu Feibohong, Li Bohan, Pan Xulun, Yan Esheng, Xu Jiliao, and others spoke successively, discussing methods of opposition. He Deqiu explained that the Municipal Council and the Waterworks Company had entered into a contract on March 17, 1928, Article 13 of which stated that the Shanghai Waterworks Company could not change the water rates again within two years from July 1, 1929. An appendix to the article stated that after this period, if the Waterworks Company wished to increase rates, it had to submit the new budget to the Municipal Council for approval five months in advance. If the Municipal Council did not agree, each party could appoint a representative two months in advance to conduct arbitration. If the arbitrators could not resolve the matter, the British Consul-General or a representative designated by the British Consul-General would make the final decision. Therefore, the Waterworks Company's proposed rate increase and the Municipal Council's hasty approval were both in violation of this contract and disregarded the public opinion of the citizens. The following resolutions were passed unanimously: 1. A letter will be sent to the Municipal Council, stating that the proposed water rate increase is considered an increase in the burden on residents and a violation of the contract signed by the Municipal Council and the Waterworks Company in 1928, and that a serious reconsideration is necessary and the implementation should be stopped. 2. A letter will be sent to the Chinese Councilors, requesting them to unanimously advocate against the increase. 3. A letter will be sent to the Real Estate Association, requesting them to publish a notice to all property owners not to enter into new contracts with the Waterworks Company. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. The texts of the various letters are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Director Bei's Letter of Resignation</p>
<p>To the Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association: I am writing to inform you that I will be traveling to the United States on business and will be leaving Shanghai soon. My itinerary will involve research and my stay will inevitably be lengthy, at least six months or more. The return date cannot be determined. Regarding the position of Chinese Director of the Municipal Council to which I was elected by your association, I believe that increasing the number of directors to five was achieved with great effort and through the combined efforts of the Chinese side. Since success was so hard-won, I should not be absent for a long period of time, lest it be criticized by foreigners. To demonstrate the seriousness of the Chinese in external affairs, I would like to request your association to elect another capable person to fill this position to facilitate progress. I humbly request that a meeting be convened as soon as possible to consider and implement this matter. I am deeply grateful. Sincerely, Bei Zuyi.</p>
<p>▲ Letter of Commendation to Director Bei</p>
<p>To Director Bei: Your letter of August 23rd has been received, stating that you will be traveling to the United States on business for more than six months and intend to resign from the position of Director of the Municipal Council. Our association considers this matter to be of great importance, and the Standing Committee and Executive Committee both believe that they have no power to decide. Therefore, a general meeting of representatives was convened today to discuss the matter. Everyone believed that you had to leave the country for several months to develop your bank's business. Although the public intention was to retain you, we had no choice but to reluctantly comply with your request. We believe that you have served the public and made many contributions, so you should be commended and thanked. We sincerely hope that you will return soon so that you can continue to serve the public. We are sending this letter to you with our best wishes for a pleasant journey.</p>
<p>▲ Notification to Director Hu</p>
<p>To Director Hu: It has been found that Mr. Bei Songsun, a director of our association attending the Municipal Council, will be leaving the country soon to go to Europe and America to study banking business and has submitted his resignation. After considering the facts, today's general meeting of representatives reluctantly complied with his request and held a vote to elect a replacement on the spot. As a result of the vote count, you were elected as the successor to the current term of the Municipal Council director. In addition to submitting a letter to the Municipal Council, we are sending this letter to inform you of this matter.</p>
<p>▲ Biography of Director Hu</p>
<p>Hu Zutong, courtesy name Mengjia, is a native of Yin County, Zhejiang Province. He is 43 years old and holds a Master's degree in Commerce from the University of Birmingham, England. He initially served as Deputy Manager of the Zhejiang Bank of Shanghai, then as Deputy Manager of the Bank of Communications of Shanghai, and was subsequently promoted to Manager. In the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the bank was reorganized and he was elected as General Manager. He currently also serves as a Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bank and Chairman of the Shanghai Banking Association.</p>
<p>▲ Important Letter Appendix</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association the day before yesterday, which stated: We are writing to inform you that the proposed 25% increase in water rates in the Public Concession, which is scheduled to take effect on September 1st, will have a significant and profound impact on the lives of millions of residents within the concession. All residents within the concession are unanimously opposed to it. We understand that your association has included the opposition to the water rate increase on the agenda of the general meeting of representatives on September 5th, which demonstrates that your association is able to understand the interests of the residents within the concession and fulfill its responsibility of representing the opinions of all residents within the concession. We are very grateful. Our association has a warm enthusiasm for supporting your association's words and actions, and we should even more closely follow the opposition to the water rate increase. We are hereby presenting our collective views for your consideration and selection, and we request that you actively negotiate to revoke the Waterworks Company's proposed rate increase. First, water is used to supply residents' drinking water, and living things live by water. If they get it, they live; if they don't get it, they die. People's use of water is even more important. Therefore, in all countries in the world, the drinking water of cities is mostly directly managed by municipal authorities, so that residents can enjoy the right to cheap drinking water. Second, even if it is run by businesses, the drinking water price must be approved by the municipal authorities. On the one hand, it is licensed as a monopoly, originally hoping that citizens can also enjoy the right to cheap drinking water. The Waterworks Company is not subject to the pressure of competitors. Second, the municipal authority of the Public Concession is, in fact, the Municipal Council, so the right to approve the price of water also lies with the Municipal Council. However, the Public Concession's Municipal Council is the Municipal Council of all citizens within the concession, not the Municipal Council of the Waterworks Company. This kind of argument cannot be denied by anyone. Therefore, regarding the Waterworks Company's request for a rate increase, the Municipal Council, on the one hand, cannot deny the reasons for the Waterworks Company's request for a rate increase, and on the other hand, the interests of the millions of citizens within the concession who live by drinking water should also be given full consideration. Even if both interests cannot be taken together and both harms cannot be removed together, it seems that those that benefit the majority should be taken and those that harm the majority should be removed. The increase in water rates benefits a very small number of people and harms a very large number of people. Conversely, it benefits a very large number of people and harms a very small number of people. Third, the water price for Chinese-style houses was originally 5%. At that time, the rent for shops on the Great Horse Road was only 20 yuan per building. Later, the rent gradually increased, and the water price actually increased accordingly. Therefore, the water price collection rate did not change until the 16th year of the Republic (1927), when it was increased by 20%. In fact, the last rate increase was as unreasonable as this rate increase, because since the 11th year of the Republic (1922), Shanghai's rent has continued to increase due to supply and demand relations and price influences. Other various goods and services cannot be exceptions. However, since the price of water is calculated according to the rent, the conclusion is that the price rises with the rent. To put it clearly, if the rent rises by 30%, the water price will rise by 30%. In fact, the Waterworks Company has already been continuously increasing prices. Fourth, the Waterworks Company's biggest reason for requesting the Municipal Council to approve the rate increase is the decline in silver prices and the high cost of goods and labor. Regardless of the fact that it did not implement a price reduction when the London silver bar was at 61 pence in the first half of 1920, and taking a step back, the largest expenditure of other enterprises is raw materials, and the company does not have to pay for the water from the Huangpu River. In addition, there are no other public utilities that can obtain such free raw materials. If it is said that the price of water pipes has increased, it is necessary to increase the price to compensate. However, the Waterworks Company only installs large pipes, and the water pipes from the large pipes to the houses are all borne by the owners and paid to the company according to the price, and an additional installation fee is charged. Therefore, the impact of the decline in silver prices can be said to be very small. Sixth, other businesses have bad debts. For example, electricity, telephone, and even the Municipal Council's donations and taxes cannot be collected in full. However, the Waterworks Company does not have the risk of bad debts and has an unexpected benefit. For example, if the house has been rented out but is still being renovated, the water consumption is naturally not much, but the Waterworks Company can get more profit. Also, if the rent is 100 taels, including 6 taels for water, the actual rent is only 94 taels, but the Waterworks Company still calculates it according to 100 taels. Therefore, 3.67 cents are collected more for every 100 taels of rent. If there are rent arrears, the water bill is borne by the owner, so there will not be less money, and it is collected by the owner, so there is no cost to collect the money. This kind of business stability is not easy for people to seek and not easy to have. Sixth, the Waterworks Company has repeatedly said that the budget is not enough and the water bill must be increased. However, profit and loss are unavoidable for any enterprise. Since it has greatly benefited from the rise in silver prices, it is reasonable to accept the slight loss due to the fall in silver prices. Moreover, this is not the fault of the citizens who use drinking water, but a natural disaster that is similar to irresistible forces. Moreover, before the accounts of previous years are publicly audited, how can we not see the abuses of raising capital and arbitrarily spending money? Although we cannot judge the heart of a gentleman with the mind of a villain, this kind of possible thing is felt by the residents. Based on the above reasons, we dare to ask your association to allow our association to make the following requests: 1. Send a letter to the Municipal Council, immediately re-discuss the case, revoke the previous resolution approving the Waterworks Company's rate increase of 25%, and organize a committee to audit the company's accounts of previous years. If it must be implemented, the case concerns the interests of millions of residents and should be decided by a meeting of taxpayers to show special seriousness. 2. Send a letter to the attending Municipal Councilors, requesting that the case be reviewed at the Municipal Council's board of directors to achieve the goal of revoking the last resolution. The matter concerns the interests of millions of citizens within the concession. We do not mind spending time and effort to send this letter. We hope that you will handle it accordingly. We are very grateful. September 4, 1929.</p>

<p>▲ Foreign Affairs Office Notifies Tea Association Representatives</p>
<p>A Russian named Rickman has been traveling between Shanghai and Hankou for many years, engaging in Chinese tea trade with Chinese merchants. Recently, he was arrested by the authorities for going to Hankou to purchase Chinese tea. The Shanghai Tea Association, believing that Rickman was a legitimate merchant, telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting the Wuhan Headquarters to release him. Yesterday morning at around 11:00 AM, representatives Cheng Jinzhang and six others went to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to petition Chen and Liu, the two directors. Directors Chen and Liu immediately stated that the office had received a telegram from the Ministry's Asian Department on the 27th. Director He (Yingqin) of the Wuhan Headquarters had already replied to the Ministry, approving the release. Rickman should be released. The representatives then happily departed.</p>

<p>▲ Requesting Shipping Association to Ask Customs to Waive Increase</p>
<p>Shanghai is a major port for trade, with many commercial vessels coming and going every day. Each</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>ship, due to limited schedules and large cargo volumes, may experience import delays or be required to export within a set timeframe, necessitating night work for loading. According to regulations, a "Night Work Permit" must be obtained from customs before night work can commence. The original fee for this permit was 10 taels per vessel per occasion. The Jianghai Customs suddenly announced an increase in fees, requiring an additional 80% of the original amount. Shanghai shipping merchants were shocked upon hearing this and jointly petitioned for a waiver. The Customs had already rejected the request. Yesterday, Shanghai shipping merchants submitted a second public petition in opposition, determined not to stop until the cancellation goal is achieved. Details of this matter are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Customs Insists on Increasing Fees</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs' increase in the Night Work Permit fee originally set at 10 taels per occasion, now wants to raise it to 18 taels. The Shanghai shipping merchants held a general meeting, believing that they cannot bear any further burden during this time of shipping industry decline. The Shipping Association sent a letter to the Chief Inspector of Customs requesting a waiver. The Chief Inspector of Customs replied, stating that the Night Work Permit fee was set 60 years ago. Due to rising prices, it is necessary to increase it. He also stated that it is up to the shipping merchants to buy or not, indicating that he is determined to implement it. The shipping companies have no room for interference or opposition.</p>
<p>▲ Shipping Merchants Oppose a Second Time</p>
<p>Upon receiving the Chief Inspector of Customs' reply, the Shanghai shipping merchants convened a general meeting. They decided to make another statement regarding the content of the reply, and still, in the name of all shipping merchants, sent a letter to the Shipping Association, requesting them to forward it to the Commissioner of Customs, urging them to cancel the fee increase. The original letter stated briefly: "We received the letter and learned that the Customs Commissioner's refusal to accept the request of the shipping merchants to withdraw the increase in the Night Work Permit fee is deeply disconcerting. After carefully examining the Chief Inspector of Customs' reply, the reasons for not being able to waive the increase are nothing more than that the Night Work Permit fee was set 60 years ago, and now prices are rising and expenses are huge, so it must be increased proportionally. It is also said that it is up to the shipping merchants to buy or not. We believe that the principle of the state establishing customs is to facilitate commercial transport. Merchants fulfill their obligation to pay taxes, and the state fulfills its responsibility to protect them. The regular expenses of customs are not intended to be compared to tax revenue. How can tax revenue be increased due to increased trivial expenses? If the customs fees are the standard for collecting taxes, then the various tax rules will inevitably be increased and changed at any time. Our shipping merchants invest huge amounts of capital, develop transportation for the country, and serve as a hub for the transportation of commercial goods. Their ship schedules are no less than the lifeblood of other merchants' goods. Any delay will result in the loss of that lifeblood. In order to seek speed and rush to do night work, applying for a Night Work Permit is nothing more than to avoid huge losses and facilitate commercial transport. Moreover, shipping vessels already bear extremely heavy taxes to customs, such as tonnage dues, ship inspection fees, and taxes on circulars and permits. There is also a tax on fumigation. In recent years, the overall situation has been unstable. In the event of war, Chinese vessels are requisitioned for military transport, suspension of navigation, and cessation of operations are common. The shipping industry is on the verge of bankruptcy. The state does not provide protection, but suddenly wants to increase the Night Work Permit fee by 80%. The customs' attitude towards our shipping merchants is close to harsh. (omitted below) We should request your association to send another letter to the Chief Customs Commissioner to strongly advocate that the increase in the Night Work Permit fee be waived in order to maintain the dying shipping industry." This letter can be sent out today.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese Federation</p>
<h3 id="e135">Further Request to Rescind the Passport Law (Continued) <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>▲ Listing Ten Reasons</p>
<p>5. While issuing passports for both leaving and returning to the country might not entirely align with national circumstances, there are examples in other countries. However, requiring passport renewals during stays abroad is absolutely unnecessary. The Ministry of Interior's regulations for issuing certificates of nationality to overseas Chinese also stipulate that they are "for permanent retention and do not need to be exchanged." Article 11 of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Exit Passport Law states, "Passports are valid for one year. If continued residence is desired after expiration, the holder should present the old passport to the local or nearby Chinese embassy or consulate to exchange for a new one, paying the required fee. Failure to renew will render the old passport invalid." This forces overseas Chinese to pay eight yuan in passport fees every year, a disguised poll tax. It means that an overseas Chinese citizen residing abroad for a year and returning home for even a single day must obtain three passports, incurring a fee of twenty-four yuan. This is ten times shorter and less flexible than the temporary residence permits issued by the Dutch East Indies government, which are valid for two years and can be extended for another eight years free of charge. This confirms the statement made by Dutch envoy Oudendijk to Committee Member Qiu Xinyun that "the Dutch government's treatment of overseas Chinese is perhaps no worse than your own government." This could encourage the Dutch East Indies government to follow suit, forcing our overseas Chinese to renew their residence permits and pay fees annually. Other countries establish consulates to protect their overseas citizens, while our country establishes consulates to mistreat them. If the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were to reflect on this, they would surely be ashamed. This is the fifth reason why we must request a strict order to rescind this law to eliminate harsh practices and appease the expectations of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>6. Article 9 of the Provisional Exit Passport Law states that applicants for exit passports must first fill out an application form, and those applying for ordinary passports must also submit a written request, along with the following guarantee documents, to the issuing agency for approval. Those leaving for business should provide a guarantee letter from two local chambers of commerce or reputable businesses, certifying their capital amount. Those leaving for work should provide a guarantee letter from two local labor unions or reputable businesses, certifying their work skills. This method might be feasible in Europe and America, but in our country, it's like using a mallet to carve a fine point. Does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with its deep and impenetrable doors, know that very few of our countrymen leaving the country do so with capital? They are either exploited by corrupt local bullies, suffer from the ravages of war or natural disasters, are driven out by communists, or are forced by bandits. Compelled to abandon their natural inclination to settle down, they sing a sorrowful song of leaving their homeland. On the day of departure, most are penniless, possessing nothing of value. Their families cannot predict their return, and most relatives and friends consider it a final farewell. Where would such poor people find guarantors? A small shop might be possible, but where to find a reputable business? One is difficult, let alone two. By demanding what is impossible for the poor, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is opening the door to extortion by travel agencies and issuing authorities. It forces those unable to cope with extortion to suffer the oppression of human and natural disasters, unable to escape the country even until death. It forces those unwilling to sit and wait for death to become communists and bandits. It is a prelude to restrictions on Chinese immigration by the Dutch, British, Japanese, American, French, Siamese, Portuguese, and other countries and colonies. We are discriminating against ourselves before others do. While others are advocating "southward expansion," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is vigorously pursuing "southward retreat." While others are encouraging emigration, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is hindering it. While others are providing relief to the unemployed, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is creating unemployment. Does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs harbor some deep-seated animosity towards our people? The Premier is protecting overseas Chinese, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is mistreating them. The Premier is supporting farmers and laborers, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is destroying them. The Premier is promoting the people's livelihood, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is hindering it. Is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs betraying the Premier? This is the sixth reason why we must request a strict order to rescind this law to open up avenues for survival and rescue disaster victims.</p>
<p>7. Article 2 of the Provisional Return Passport Law states, "Applicants for return passports must present their exit passports to be issued. This does not apply to overseas Chinese children born abroad and naturalized citizens." At first glance, it seems comprehensive, but upon closer examination, it is actually difficult to implement. Some overseas Chinese left the country decades ago, are neither overseas students nor naturalized citizens, and left the country long before the current stringent passport laws were issued by foreign and warlord governments. At that time there was no need to apply for a passport, and of course no passport to present. Now that it is stipulated that new passports will not be issued without presenting old passports, and those without new passports will be investigated, it means that elderly emigrants who left the country before the promulgation of this passport law will never be able to re-enter the country. This is the seventh reason why we must request a strict order to rescind this law to correct errors and facilitate implementation.</p>
<p>8. According to a 1926 survey by the Straits Settlements government, a total of 348,593 overseas Chinese traveled from Xiamen, Hong Kong, Shantou, Haikou, and Guangzhou to Singapore. The number of those traveling directly from various locations to Annam, Siam, Burma, India, Penang, Malacca, the Federated Malay States, the Unfederated Malay States, the Dutch East Indies, the American Philippines, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the various continents of Europe, America, Africa, and Australia should be at least roughly equal to the number of those traveling to Singapore. This means that the number of people leaving our country each year is about 700,000. If calculated according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' passport fee of eight yuan per passport, the annual revenue would be 5.6 million yuan. The number of people returning to the country is about two-thirds of the number of people leaving, generating another 3.7 million yuan. Adding the more than 11 million overseas Chinese residing abroad, if each person has to renew their passport annually and pay a fee of eight yuan, then there would be about 90 million yuan. Even if the actual revenue is not as high, the income is still significant. However, they are using their authority to illegally collect fees. We only hear that the consul in a certain port earns a certain amount of guilders in passport fees per term, and the consulate in a certain port earns a certain amount of yuan in passport fees per month, but the use of these funds is unclear. Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stipulates that funds be remitted to the ministry every three months, there is no public announcement of the actual revenue and expenditures. This is the eighth reason why we must request a strict order to rescind this law to unify finances and clarify governance.</p>
<p>9. Our country's nationality law follows the principle of jus sanguinis (right of blood), while the Dutch colonial nationality law follows the principle of jus soli (right of soil). Overseas Chinese born in Dutch colonies are considered Chinese citizens by our country, but are considered Dutch citizens by the Dutch. However, since reason cannot be completely extinguished and facts are difficult to change immediately, the Dutch government has never made a clear distinction between locally born and overseas Chinese students. In the past, overseas Chinese students participated in the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and held the Chinese Association without Dutch government interference. However, the Chinese Consul-General in Java, Zhang, in order to facilitate the collection of passport fees and avoid diplomatic disputes with the Dutch, openly acknowledged that overseas Chinese students returning to China must first obtain a Dutch passport and then have it signed by the Chinese consul. This completely treats overseas Chinese students as foreigners. If overseas Chinese students want to return to China, they must swallow their pride and become Dutch citizens, shamelessly obtaining a Dutch passport. Otherwise, the Chinese consul will not dare to issue a passport, and they will be detained without a passport. The mental anguish is extreme. In terms of foreign affairs, this means surrendering sovereignty and humiliating the country. In terms of overseas Chinese students, it means betrayal and self-destruction. This is not only heartbreaking for hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese students, but also ridiculed by people all over the world. This is the ninth reason why we must request a strict order to rescind this law to restore national sovereignty and wash away national shame.</p>
<p>10. Before the promulgation of the Provisional Passport Law, the Dutch East Indies and the American Philippines had already implemented "overseas Chinese registration," with a registration fee of two Dutch guilders or two Philippine pesos, which had to be renewed annually. After the promulgation of the Provisional Passport Law, it is unclear whether the "overseas Chinese registration" item has been cancelled. If the two items are carried out in parallel, the overseas Chinese will be unable to bear the burden. This is the tenth reason why we must request a strict order to rescind this law to exempt repeated fees and show compassion for poor overseas Chinese. Based on these reasons, we urge your approval. If granted, all overseas Chinese will be grateful. After rescission, be able to recognize the particularly difficult situation of overseas Chinese migrating south, find ways to exempt passports, and restore the original state as before, which would be what overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia sincerely pray for. Otherwise, we earnestly request that you adopt the requests made in the Association's respectful telegram, stipulating that the passport fee for leaving and returning to the country be two dimes, and the stamp duty be two cents each, with full exemption for the poor. All the harsh practices of annual passport renewal, fee payment, replacement for loss or damage, and fee payment should be abolished. And the items in Article 11 of the Exit Passport Law concerning the guarantee of capital amount and work skills by reputable businesses, and the guarantee by legal institutions that tourists will not engage in any business after leaving the country should be deleted. Then the so-called passport will be worthy of its name. We earnestly submit our plea, feeling uneasy as we await your order. Respectfully, the Overseas Chinese Federation. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e136">Jiang Baozhen Escapes Kidnapping in the Rain, Rescued Half an Hour After Abduction <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>▲ Police Obtain Information and Capture Bandit Vehicle</p>
<p>▲ Car Overturns into Ditch, Hostage Survives</p>
<p>On the 28th of last month, Zhou Rangsan, a Chinese employee of Mobil Oil, was kidnapped by bandits at the entrance of his alley residence on Hardoon Road. After the incident, the victim reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, who immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives in vehicles to search for the perpetrators. They encountered the bandit vehicle on Hongqiao Road, arrested one bandit, and extracted the location of the hostage, rescuing Zhou. The entire ordeal, from abduction to escape, lasted only three hours, a feat praised by the police force. Yesterday, another Ningbo native, Jiang Baozhen, was abducted by bandits on Xinza Gate Bridge Road around 9:30 AM. After the victim's chauffeur reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, the police followed the same procedure, dispatching armed detectives in cars to patrol the roads in the western district. They eventually spotted the car carrying the hostage near the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Haig Road and gave chase. The bandits, panicked, overturned the car into a ditch and abandoned the hostage, fleeing the scene. Jiang was able to escape from the bandits' clutches, approximately half an hour after being abducted, amidst heavy rain.</p>
<p>▲ The kidnapped Ningbo native, Jiang Baozhen, is 53 years old and made his fortune in the construction industry. He resides at 445 Xinza Gate Bridge Road and owns a Buick car for transportation, with license plate number 10051. His chauffeur, Ah Mao, was hired last year. Yesterday morning, at 9:30 AM, Ah Mao had just finished cleaning and parking the car outside the gate, waiting for his employer to use it. Unbeknownst to him, three bandits were lying in wait by the roadside. Upon seeing Jiang enter the car, one bandit drew a gun and ordered chauffeur Ah Mao not to make a sound, jumping into the passenger seat to monitor his actions. The remaining bandits entered the back of the car, flanking Jiang Baozhen on both sides, and ordered the chauffeur to drive off. Jiang had originally intended to go to his office on Fujian Road, but now he was at the mercy of the bandits, unable to escape.</p>
<p>▲ Escape After abducting the "God of Wealth," the bandits forced the chauffeur to drive west. At the intersection of Hardoon Road, the car stopped temporarily, and the chauffeur, Ah Mao, was driven out. Then, the bandits drove off themselves, leaving a trail of dust. Ah Mao immediately rushed to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station to report the kidnapping of his employer and the hijacking of car number 10051. Upon receiving the information, Chinese and Western detectives from the police station immediately armed themselves and drove off in cars to search for the stolen vehicle in the western district, including Daxi Road and Hongqiao Road. Near the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Haig Road, they spotted a car driving straight ahead, with license plate number 10051. The police car accelerated and gave chase. Hearing someone pursuing them from behind, the bandits drove frantically. Unfortunately, it was raining heavily, the road was very slippery, and the road was extremely narrow. In a moment of panic, the bandits' car tires slipped into a ditch by the roadside, rendering the car immobile. They abandoned the hostage and fled for their lives. Jiang Baozhen was helped out of the car by the detectives. Although he was fortunate to be unharmed, he was also in a state of shock. He glanced at his watch, which read ten o'clock, and the sky cleared up, with sunlight shining over the fields. Jiang, upon returning home, expressed his gratitude for his narrow escape.</p>

<p>Pirates Off the Coast of Songkou</p>
<h3 id="e138">Abducted a Large Number of Crew Members <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>▲ Totaling Over Forty People</p>
<p>Recently, bandits have gathered off the coast of Wusongkou in the Juegang sea area, and the fishermen in that area have fled. At around 4 PM the day before yesterday, a large oceangoing vessel was passing through the area when two pirate ships suddenly appeared, blocking its path. The pirates, armed with guns, boarded the vessel and searched it. Since the ship was empty, they abducted six people, including the shipowner and the captain. Three people were also abducted from the Guanyi Xiang oceangoing vessel. Yesterday morning at around 5 AM, two fishing boats were abducted, along with fourteen crew members. At the same time, four sand boats were also successively abducted, along with over twenty crew members. In total, over forty hostages were abducted, all of whom are being held for ransom.</p>
<p>Li Huchen, the commander of the First Anti-Smuggling Brigade stationed in Songjiang, received orders from his superiors to lead a team to cooperate with the Changshu County government's public security team and the naval and land police to suppress bandits in Liuhe, Hupu, Baimao Port, and other areas. Commander Li led his subordinates, including Captain Shi Fugeng of patrol boat No. 1 and Captain Pu Jinrong of patrol boat No. 2, as well as patrol boats Nos. 2, 3, and 4 of the First Company (totaling five vessels), equipped with machine guns and small cannons, set sail at 9 AM yesterday morning to the aforementioned locations to cooperate with the military and police in searching for and suppressing bandits, in order to eliminate banditry and protect shipping.</p>
<p>In the Courtroom</p>
<h3 id="e139">Evil Aunt Suddenly Faints <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>▲ Continued Trial of the Case of Strangling the Daughter-in-Law</p>
<p>▲ Deceased's Brother Also Attends Court</p>
<p>▲ Defendants Deny Conspiracy to Murder</p>
<p>After the sudden death of Li Zhang, the eldest daughter-in-law of Li Qingfu, a patrolman from 615 Gordon Road Police Station, due to rumors of murder, the Special District Local Court ordered an exhumation of the body. The findings determined strangulation. The police have formally charged Li Qingfu, his wife Li Chen, and his two sons Li Yulong and Li Kun with violating Article 282 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court and ordered the four male and female defendants to be brought to court for interrogation. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the results of the prosecutor's examination revealed rope marks on the neck of the body, bloodstains on the head, and teeth that had fallen out, undoubtedly indicating strangulation. Li Qingfu, after the death of his daughter-in-law, had sent a letter to the deceased's mother, still claiming that she died from a "sha" ailment. This letter has been submitted to the police by the deceased's brother. He now presents the case, stating that during the initial interrogation the day before yesterday, Li Yulong and Li Kun both claimed that they had returned home from their work at the public bus company around 1:30 AM on the night of the 27th of last month. The police have sent detectives to investigate the company and have found that their statement was completely fabricated. Li Yulong had left the company at 4 PM that day, while Li Yulong had left the company at 11 PM. This point should be noted, he said. At this time, Chen, the wife of Li Qingfu, who was standing in the defendant's box, suddenly fell backward, her face turning pale, her eyes open and unmoving. Those who touched her felt that her hands were as cold as ice, and she did not respond when called. Judge Wu, seeing her condition, believed that she had a sudden illness and immediately ordered the bailiffs to help her out of the courtroom. He ordered the forensic doctor to examine her first, and the prison director was instructed to send her to Guangren Hospital for treatment. After the disturbance, the court continued to summon the witness, Mrs. Zhan Li, who testified that she was a neighbor of the Li family. On the night of the 27th of last month, at 11 PM, she still saw the deceased washing clothes by the tap at the door. Another witness, Mrs. Fang Chen, testified that she saw the deceased arguing with her mother-in-law at 7 or 8 PM that evening, and her mother-in-law slapped her face once. She went to mediate. Undertaker Wu Genfa testified that when he was dressing the deceased, he found blood seeping out of her neck, and there were also injuries on her fingers. Zhang Laiyun, the deceased's brother, arrived in court and stated that he received a letter from Li Qingfu on July 7 of the lunar calendar, stating that his sister had died of a sudden "sha" ailment. When he arrived in Shanghai, she had already been placed in a coffin. His sister had been married to Yulong for three years, and her mother-in-law usually treated her poorly. In April of last year, her mother-in-law's sister came to his house and talked about the strained relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Judge Wu then questioned the defendant, Li Yulong, who stated that he did not initially know how his wife had died. After the trial opened the day before yesterday, his mother told his father, who then told him, that his wife had hanged herself. Judge Wu, seeing that he was unwilling to confess how he had murdered his wife, instructed him, "Your parents, brothers, and you are all defendants in the same case. Your whole family is in custody. If you can confess who masterminded the murder and who did it, you can save your whole family from suffering." Yulong then stated, "I returned home at 1 AM that evening. After going upstairs, I saw my wife being helped by my mother to sit on the bed. I asked what had happened, and my mother said that my wife was suffering from 'sha.' I went out to find a doctor, but it was late at night and there was no one to be found. So, I went back home and saw my mother still sitting on the edge of the bed, while my wife was lying down. Then I went downstairs. I really don't know when my wife died, but there was definitely no strangulation." Li Kun confessed, "I returned home at 1 AM that night and saw my father cooling off at the door. I asked why I was so late, and I told him that I had been playing at the dog racing track, which led to my father scolding me. I then slept on a makeshift bed in the living room. I woke up at 4 AM, and my mother told me that my sister-in-law had died from 'sha.'" Questioning Li Qingfu, he consistently claimed that he did not know. The court ordered the defendants to be returned to custody, and the trial was adjourned to September 17.</p>
<p>Case of Accusation of Rape</p>
<h3 id="e140">Dancer Leaves Shanghai <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>▲ Leaving a Letter Expressing Apology</p>
<p>▲ Stating She Did Not Enter Defendant's Room That Night</p>
<p>▲ Polish Youth Benefited Not a Little</p>
<p>▲ Borrowing a Gun Also Has Someone to Testify</p>
<p>The Polish youth, Adam Szyszlo, was accused of rape by Li Guifen, a dancer from the Jue Lu Dance Hall. The General Patrol Station sent detectives to 9 1/2 Hankou Road, 4th floor, to arrest the youth and seize an unlicensed handgun found in his possession. He was brought to the Special District Local Court. Because the defendant denied the rape, the court ordered the plaintiff to be sent to a doctor for examination before further interrogation. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, Judge Zhou Hanting resumed the trial. The plaintiff, Li Guifen, was not present. According to the police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, the police had sent detectives to summon the plaintiff, but she no longer lived at the original address, making it impossible to summon her. The reason for her absence is unclear. The defendant believes that the plaintiff made a false accusation and now dares not appear in court. The plaintiff's husband was also not present. Judging from the doctor's written report of the examination of the plaintiff, there were only a few brief words regarding the circumstances of the alleged rape. As for the defendant's possession of a private handgun, he was in violation of the regulations prohibiting military firearms. Next, Western Detective Wilson reported that he had been unable to find the plaintiff. He then inquired with the manager of the dance hall, who said that Li Guifen and her husband, surnamed Chen, and a Russian had resigned on the 30th of last month. The Russian left a letter in Russian, saying that if the police or the court came to investigate, they could read the letter. The letter had the signatures of Li and her husband. Judge Zhou ordered Zhang to submit the letter as evidence and summoned a Russian translator to translate the meaning of the letter. The letter generally stated that the Polish man was drunk that night and had a slight argument with Li Guifen, but Li did not actually enter his room that night. Due to a minor suspicion, a lawsuit had unfortunately been filed, damaging their friendship. Li deeply apologized and therefore decided to leave Shanghai, so she would not be able to attend the next hearing. Afterwards, the police lawyer and the defendant's lawyer had a mutual argument. The court ordered the defendant to post bail and set the date for sentencing as the 10th of this month.</p>

<p>Chinese Overseer and Japanese Maid</p>
<p>▲ Maid Dies from Abortion</p>
<p>▲ Overseer Hangs Himself Out of Deep Love</p>
<p>Number 63 Shi Gao Ta Road in Zhabei is the residence of Kimura, the Japanese manager of the Ewo Cotton Mill. He employs Bian Sheng Shen, a 36-year-old Chinese man from Tianjin, as an overseer, and a Japanese maid, who is young and beautiful. There are many Japanese residents in the area, and she is considered the most beautiful of the maids. She and Bian got along very well. Later, Kimura returned to Japan, leaving only these two servants to guard the house, which led to a Chinese-Japanese love affair. Unexpectedly, the product of their love had already been conceived. Recently, her pregnancy became increasingly apparent, making it difficult to hide. Kimura then returned to Shanghai. The maid, fearing trouble, went to a hospital to have an abortion. Unfortunately, she died from the abortion at 6 PM the day before yesterday. When the news reached Bian Sheng Shen, he felt that he was responsible for her death. Out of love, he decided to commit suicide. At around 8 PM, he went out alone to a tree in the cemetery in the Jiehang area, where he hanged himself with a silk trouser belt. When he was discovered yesterday morning, the Japanese consulate police station and concession police station arrived at the scene to investigate. The Public Security Bureau's Fifth District Police Station then ordered Wang Jinfu, a local security guard from the 91st map, to report the case to the Local Court yesterday afternoon. Prosecutor Wu Shixin arrived at the scene and examined the body, finding that he was wearing a white summer cloth gown, white cloth shorts and pants, white socks, and white shoes, all white. He determined that the death was caused by hanging. The body was ordered to be collected by family members for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Six Bandits Executed Yesterday <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Bandits Only Asked for Food and Drink</p>
<p>▲ Showing No Fear of Death</p>
<p>The bandits Jia Kuizhong, Li Zhaozhen, Zhou Ziqing, Wang Maoyi, Zhang Yubiao, and Liu Guicai were apprehended by the Huishan Police Station. After repeated trials in court, they were found guilty and sentenced to death. The Special District Local Court had received instructions from higher authorities to execute the bandits according to law. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, the court informed the handling police station to bring Jia and the other six men from the Western Prison to the court. Judge Cheng Shangfeng took the stand, informed the bandits that they would be executed today, and asked if they had any last words. Upon hearing the announcement, the bandits remained calm, showing no fear and having no last words. They only requested to be given food, drink, and cigarettes. Judge Cheng immediately ordered the bailiffs to purchase the items. After the prisoners were taken to the waiting room, they smoked and drank to their fill before being escorted by the detectives to the cars for transportation to the execution grounds at the Jiangsu Second Prison in Caohejing. The Local Court appointed Prosecutor Zhao Zhigui as the execution supervisor. Zhao brought his secretary Zhang Guowei and inspector Xuan Zhiming, along with Police Chief Yang Deshan, Police Officer Chen Xihui, and twelve bailiffs, who travelled in cars to the execution grounds at the Caohejing Second Prison. The criminals were escorted and Zhao, along with Warden Dong Changmin, questioned them about their names, ages, and origins. The prosecutor asked what their occupation was, and they all replied that they were professional kidnappers. The official asked if they had any words for their families, and they replied that they had no words, but asked for some wine. Their attitude was extraordinarily calm, showing no fear and facing execution with generosity, truly unconcerned with the law. The prosecutor ordered the execution to be carried out. Police Chief Yang then directed the executioners Xue Bingzhang and Yin Daoxu to carry out the executions. The bodies were taken to the hall for collection, sealed, and awaiting identification by relatives.</p>

He then assisted the boatmen in searching for him, but there was no trace. He returned to report to the police station and notified the water police station by telephone. Before the man committed suicide, he had been pacing back and forth on the pier. Passersby suspected that he was playing and did not pay attention, so his clothing and age are unknown.</p>

<p>▲Approved for Trial Operation by the Public Utilities Bureau</p>
<p>Previously, due to rising gasoline prices, city buses were unable to maintain operations. With the approval of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, fares on all routes were increased by two cents per ticket. However, the Shanghai South Bus routes 1, 3, and 2, which run parallel to the trams, have seen a sharp decline in passengers since the fare increase. Overall, business has decreased significantly compared to before. In light of this, and considering that the fare increase was disproportionately high for the short distances of these two routes, the company has revised the fare prices for the two routes. Route 1 will start at four cents, with an increase of three cents per stop thereafter (except for the section from Laoximen to Dongjiadu, which will be seventeen cents, with a discretionary increase of one cent), for a total of thirty-two cents for the entire route. Route 3 will also start at four cents, with an increase of three cents per stop thereafter (except for the section from Laoximen to Xinkaihe, which will be seventeen cents), for a total of twenty-three cents for the entire route. It is reported that the proposal has been submitted to the Public Utilities Bureau for approval on a trial basis.</p>

<p>Gao Wansheng, the leader of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, recently received a tip-off stating that Wang Fusheng (nicknamed "Robber Fusheng"), the mastermind behind the robbery of the Hongfa Hat Factory, owned by Xu Buqing and Wu Dongxuan, residents of No. 23 Changsheng Street, in the jurisdiction of the First Precinct of the Second District of this city on July 25th of this year, was hiding in the Meihua Lane overpass building on Firewheel Mill Street in the French Concession. The tip-off requested that officers be dispatched immediately to make an arrest. Leader Gao immediately reported the situation to Captain Lu, who then ordered Leader Gao, together with detectives Gu Liancheng, and additionally assigned leaders Shan Bin and Han Ruisheng, detectives Ding Shunbao, Gao Juchuan, Xu Rong, Zhou Peisan, Wu Xiufeng, and Zhang Xinlong, to cooperate with Chinese and foreign detectives from the French Concession Police Department. They went to the address and arrested Wang. Wang then led the detectives to Room 13 of the Xinxin Hotel at the entrance of Baoyu Lane on Avenue Edward VII, where they arrested accomplices and suspects Yang Kun, Zhou Shunlin, and Ye Sumei. During interrogation, Wang confessed that he had gathered accomplices, including Little Tiger and four others, to rob Xu and Wu at gunpoint, and that they had pawned the stolen goods. Captain Lu then ordered the original detectives to take Wang to the Huishi Police Station, where the captain dispatched detectives to arrest Little Tiger (also known as Yao Jinkui) at the Laozha Bridge embankment. At the same time, Luo Derun was arrested at the Shanghai Tea House. All were brought in for preliminary questioning, and all confessed. After Captain Lu finished questioning them, he ordered the victims to identify the suspects, and then immediately prepared a document to submit to the Judicial Section for punishment.</p>
<p>He Xiong, the leader of the detective team of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei, received a tip-off yesterday from informants stating that Jiang Dehe, a wanted criminal involved in the robbery of the Pudong Yanjiaqiao Tax Bureau (i.e., the Jiangsu Provincial Cotton Tax Bureau), was hiding near Guangzhao Road. He immediately reported to the District Chief, who ordered patrolling officers to cooperate with detectives Yao Ziyun, Zhou Guicai, Li Zongnian, Li Guiqing, and Jiao Yunshan to go to the address. On the way on Guangzhao Road, they suddenly encountered the criminal Jiang Dehe and arrested him. Director Jin questioned Jiang, who confessed that his alias was Xiao Erzi, that he was from Funing, twenty-two years old, and lived at No. 4 Dongjiadu. On May 4th of this year, he and his accomplice Cao San from Taixing robbed the Pudong Tax Bureau. Cao used a gun to intimidate, and they stole a total of six hundred yuan in foreign currency. They divided the loot on the way, with Jiang receiving two hundred yuan and Cao receiving four hundred yuan because he had a handgun. Cao also gave Cao's cohabitant Chen Bulou ten yuan. Because Jiang confessed to the robbery and the distribution of the loot, the director, considering the case involved a robbery, ordered that Jiang be sent to the bureau and instructed the police detectives to arrest Cao San, who was still at large, for questioning.</p>

<p>Chu Guocheng, a Ningbo native, forty years old, runs a carving workshop at No. 22 Youheng Road, Gongping Road, Hongkou. He married Tong many years ago. Tong is thirty-one years old. Their relationship was usually very close. They had been married for over ten years and had a daughter who had already passed away. Yesterday morning, Chu ordered an apprentice to buy dozens of steamed buns for the guest master's breakfast. At that time, a friend came to visit, and Chu was briefly occupied with him. Tong saw the many steamed buns on the table and took two to eat at will. After the friend left, Chu blamed Tong for grabbing the steamed buns in front of a guest, which was not proper for a woman. Tong refused to be outdone and retorted. Chu became angry and hit Tong several times with a wooden stick. Tong was extremely distressed and cried uncontrollably. By lunchtime, she refused to eat. Chu did not pay much attention to it at the time. Until after 3:00 PM, Tong instructed the apprentice to enter the room and call her fellow villager Luo Aru into the room. She said to Luo that when he returned to his hometown, please send a message to my mother, as I fear I will not be able to see her again. Luo saw that her face had changed dramatically, and she was moaning constantly. He suspected that she had taken poison and immediately reported it to the police. She was taken to Tongren Hospital in a vehicle. After the doctor tried to save her for a long time, it was ineffective. At around 5:00 PM, she was transferred to Guangren Hospital for treatment in an ambulance. As of 9:00 PM, she was still in critical condition.</p>

<p>Wang Yunde, a squad member of the Second Detachment of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, was patrolling the river yesterday near the new garbage bridge on the Suzhou Creek when he saw a boat speeding forward. He immediately ordered it to stop and then boarded the boat to conduct an inspection. He found 25 Mauser pistols hidden in a large wooden box in the cabin. He also found 12,500 rounds of ammunition in three small wooden boxes next to it. At that time, Wang Zhaozi and Chen Renliang, who were escorting the firearms, presented a passport issued by the National Government for verification. The squad member found that the number of firearms listed on the passport did not match the actual number being transported, suggesting suspected private smuggling. He detained Wang and Chen, along with Chen Baoan, the boatman, and the seized evidence, and brought them back to the detachment. During questioning by the patrol officer, Wang and Chen confessed that they were employees of the Asia Commercial Transport Company and that the firearms were arranged by their boss, Lin Wenguang, and Guo Yiting, who then sent them to hire Chen's boat to transport them to the Huitong Transport Company. They were then transferred to the South City General Team. Later, Asia sent another employee, Chen Junli, with a passport issued by the Director of the Aviation Department of the National Government, Zhang Huiliang, and a passport from the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining to the team, requesting the return of the seized firearms. Since the Aviation Department and the Lieshan Coal Mine Bureau were not related, and the passport from the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining had expired a month ago, there were many suspicions. They were ordered to prepare a document and submit it to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation and verification.</p>

<p>An elderly local woman, Ni Jinshi, yesterday brought her widowed granddaughter-in-law, Zhao, to the Third District of the Public Security Bureau, claiming that she was sixty-six years old and lived in the Wu Family Alley behind the Lan Nidu Town in Pudong. Her husband died early, and she had maintained her chastity and raised her son for decades. However, the family's fortunes declined, and her son and daughter-in-law passed away one after another, causing the family's assets to dwindle. Now, only she and her granddaughter-in-law remain. After her grandson passed away in May of this year, her granddaughter-in-law became restless and moved elsewhere. She is now planning to sell the family property and remarry. Ni believes that remarriage is acceptable, but the property cannot be sold, leading to a family dispute. She came to the district to request a public judgment. According to Zhao, she is twenty-one years old, and after her husband died in May of this year, all expenses have been borrowed from outside. Now, she cannot pay the rent, so she plans to sell some of the household items to make a living. The District Chief, after reviewing the statements, considered that the pair of elderly and young widows were very pitiful. He instructed them to leave and seek mediation from relatives and friends to avoid litigation.</p>

Police Chief Lou reported the situation to the two railway police headquarters for instructions, which ordered the dismissal of Yang Chongyu on September 1st. Unexpectedly, after his dismissal, Yang Chongyu suddenly sent a letter from Yong yesterday to Jian Huanluan, a patrol officer at the police department, claiming that he would commit suicide. The original letter is excerpted below: "Mr. Huanluan, I am leaving the station this time to seek my final peace, not because of my dismissal. It is only important to visit Poshen [referring to a temple], but my secret cannot be announced. I have been in adversity for more than a year, but my time in office was just a delay. What I am not satisfied with is that I could not settle my affairs before leaving, so I am writing to ask you to please give Zhang Yonggui one yuan from the three yuan of rice subsidy that will be issued later by my superiors, one yuan and some change to the snack shop behind the station, and ask Mr. Zhu Hongfei to take away the remaining boxes, mats, and luggage, which cost 2.11 yuan. I have already notified you separately about my own letter. Of the three yuan, there is still 0.09 yuan left, please give it to the person who washes my clothes, or give it to a guest who needs travel money, it's all the same. I ask you to please ask Shou Xinian and Chen Baochang to handle the above matters. Even in the disaster of being submerged, I know that they will be grateful. All colleagues, your opportunity to chat and laugh has arrived again. A smile, Yang Chongyu."

<h3 id="e163">The Social Affairs Bureau Establishes Factory Inspectors <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>▲ Promulgating Inspection Rules</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in accordance with the Factory Law, should send personnel to inspect the factories and be responsible for guidance on whether the management and treatment of workers are good or not, and whether the workers are diligent or not. Therefore, it immediately drafted factory inspection rules to send personnel to inspect the factories at any time. These rules have been passed by the Bureau's 70th Bureau Affairs Meeting. They are recorded below. (Provisional Rules for Factory Inspection) Article 1. This Bureau is organizing factory inspections to improve the living conditions and work efficiency of workers in this city. Article 2. The time and location of the inspections will be determined by the director at any time and carried out by assigned personnel. Article 3. The duties of the inspectors are as follows: 1. To inspect the safety equipment, hygiene equipment, and working conditions of each factory, and provide appropriate guidance. 2. To investigate the difficulties in factory management. 3. To advise and supervise the implementation of relevant laws and regulations promulgated by the government. 4. To handle special assignments. Article 4. If the inspectors find that any of the following situations exist in any factory, they shall immediately report to the director for approval: 1. The workplace has poor air circulation, unclean drinking water, insufficient light, or no sanitary equipment. 2. There are no safety devices for the workers' bodies, factory buildings, and machinery installations. 3. Child and female workers are engaged in work that is harmful to public morals or has dangerous properties. 4. Workers do not obey management and guidance, which may hinder the factory's business operations. Article 5. Inspectors should take a peaceful attitude when inspecting. Article 6. Inspectors must report the results of each inspection to the director. Article 7.

<h3 id="e164">Negotiations on the Discharge of Chinese Employees by Citibank in Yokohama <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>▲ Should be Negotiated by the Minister to Japan with the Tokyo Branch</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received letters from the Yokohama branch directly under the Chinese Kuomintang, requesting negotiations on the discharge of Chinese employees by the Yokohama and Tokyo branches of Citibank. The Chamber sent personnel to negotiate with the Shanghai branch of Citibank twice, but both times they were given empty words and evasions. After deliberation at a standing committee meeting, it was submitted to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for verification. A reply has now been received from the Social Affairs Bureau, which stated in summary that after sending personnel to investigate, Mr. Hogge, the manager of Citibank, claimed that the Shanghai branch was unaware of the discharge of Chinese employees by the Tokyo branch. Although the Shanghai branch is the Far East head office, the administrative power of the Tokyo branch is under the jurisdiction of the Far East branch of the New York head office. Therefore, this negotiation can be requested by the minister to Japan with the manager of the Tokyo branch. It is unknown why the Municipal Chamber of Commerce inquired about this matter in two letters, or perhaps it was a misunderstanding between the Far East head office and the Far East branch. Accordingly, since there is a misunderstanding about jurisdiction, the minister to Japan should be directly requested to order the subordinate authorities to negotiate directly with the Tokyo branch of the bank. If the negotiations are ineffective, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be requested to inform the U.S. Minister to the U.S., Wu, to negotiate with the Far East branch of the bank's New York head office. The Chamber will immediately forward a letter to the Yokohama branch for review.</p>

<p>The Ministry of the Navy has ordered the Wusong Coastal Defense Command to set up a radio direction finder and to select sites at Jiuduan, Nanhui Mouth, and Putuoshan near the Wusong Estuary, so that ships can navigate the sea routes along the coast without errors in direction during fog and dew. The British Marconi R.G.I4 direction finders have already been shipped to Shanghai.

<h3 id="e167">Whether Promissory Notes are Exempt from Stamp Tax <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Money Dealers' Association yesterday, stating that on the 4th of this month, it received a letter from the Hai'an Chamber of Commerce stating that the representatives of the Money Dealers' Association in the town inquired at the meeting, stating that each of the shops in their industry issues a type of promissory note (ranging from dozens to hundreds of yuan). This type of promissory note is issued by the shop in exchange for money brought by a person, making it easier to carry and having the same credit as cash, commonly known as "money tickets delivered to the door." It is similar in nature to bank checks. At present, the stamp tax inspection is strict. It is asked whether the promissory notes in their industry need to be affixed with stamps, and requested for instructions. A sample of the promissory note was attached. The Chamber has discussed the matter repeatedly and finds it difficult to make a decision. However, it recalls that in previous years, during the time of your former General Chamber of Commerce, there was a precedent for negotiating with the government to exempt bank checks from stamp tax. Since the promissory notes of the money dealers are equal in nature to checks, it seems that they can be exempted from stamp tax. However, the current laws and regulations are very strict, so it is not dared to be neglected. Therefore, a letter is sent with a sample of the note, requesting the Association to review and provide guidance on whether the aforementioned promissory notes can be exempted from stamp tax and whether the precedent for bank checks can be invoked. A detailed discussion and instructions are requested. It is also said that the money dealers in Shanghai also have a habit of using such promissory notes, and it is asked whether they are affixed with stamps, and for instructions. It is found that the stamp tax regulations, in the second category, have provisions for bank checks used by banks and money dealers, and notes of a similar nature, to be affixed with stamps according to the value. Therefore, the promissory notes seem to be within the scope of this provision. However, in the past, silver money dealers had submitted a request to the ministry to exempt checks from stamp tax. At present, it is not known whether the promissory notes can be exempted from stamp tax by invoking this precedent. Therefore, this letter is sent to request the Association to investigate and show the details, so that it can be passed along.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Stern Investigation into Impersonation by the Anti-Drug Association <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, based on a report from the Jianghai Customs, learned that someone was using the name of an official of the Association to report to the Customs about the private transportation of drugs, requesting a strict investigation. The Association is currently trying to investigate. Unexpectedly, someone else recently used the name of the Shanghai Municipal Anti-Drug Association to write a letter to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, accusing personnel there of embezzling drugs. All of these incidents have been investigated by the Anti-Drug Association. The Association believes that the matter of reporting is extremely important, and the Association had previously established and announced simple regulations for reporting documents. All matters such as reporting must be handled in accordance with the prescribed procedures to be appropriate and avoid abuses. Unexpectedly, cases of impersonation have been discovered one after another recently. If these are not investigated quickly, it will have a significant impact on the reputation of the Association. In addition to asking the government to strictly investigate the cases that have already been discovered, a notice is issued to all agencies and organizations as follows: (Respectfully, the Association has been handling external reports of disrupting the ban on opium and private transportation of drugs in accordance with the Association's regulations for reporting documents. After careful consideration, only when the evidence is deemed reliable will the Association forward the matter to administrative agencies for investigation in accordance with the law. This is to show seriousness and avoid abuses. However, it has recently been found that there have been repeated cases of impersonating the Association's name to act pretentiously, such as falsely using the name of an official of the Association to report the private transportation of drugs to the Jianghai Customs, and someone falsely using the name of the Shanghai Municipal Anti-Drug Association to report the embezzlement of seized drugs to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, requesting investigation. This is extremely shocking. If the above-mentioned incidents are true, they could be handled in accordance with the reporting procedures for forwarding to the relevant authorities for investigation. Why use a false name? It is obvious that there is another purpose. Fearing that the outside world does not understand the truth and will be misled, in addition to sending a letter to the local government to strictly investigate, we are hereby sending this special notice, hoping that you will take note of it. The future of the Association's work is of great importance. We wish you all the best, the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association.)</p>

At the same time, the branch is urged to do its utmost to raise more funds to save the people from this great calamity.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Talking About an Old Diplomat <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yangzhou</p>
<p>Most of our country's diplomatic talents have lost power and territory. There are not many who can negotiate and protect the national interest. It is rare to find someone with a long-term vision who considers the world situation for far-reaching plans. I found Mr. Yao Ziliang among the predecessors.</p>
<p>Mr. Yao Ziliang is an old gentleman in Shanghai. Many people must know him. However, a piece of diplomatic history from his time in Europe may not be known to the people of our country. I am related to Mr. Yao. I heard about it from Mr. Yao himself. Mr. Yao traveled to Europe with Minister Hong Wenqing when he was young. Although Wenqing was the best in the country, he did not know the world situation. Mr. Yao studied economics and was also interested in geography and the art of diplomacy. At that time, Bismarck was the Prime Minister of Germany. The Franco-Prussian War had just ended. Germany leaped to become a strong country in Western Europe. Bismarck's vision had already penetrated the trend. The rise of the Germans would inevitably be envied by other countries and lead to a world war. The Germans' science and manufacturing were not to be feared, but the narrow land and dense population would inevitably feel insufficient in the production of raw materials. He wanted to unite a powerful and well-resourced ally to help him. At the right time, Mr. Yao met Bismarck in Berlin. Mr. Yao also believed that in a world where the weak are prey to the strong, it is necessary to form a strong neighbor as foreign aid. He talked with Bismarck about the affairs of the world. Heroes saw the same thing. Bismarck immediately proposed the opportunity for a Chinese alliance. His strategy was for Germany to provide manufacturing talents and set up factories in China to manufacture various weapons of war. Germany would provide capital, and China would provide raw materials. The products would be used for China and Germany to reorganize their military equipment. In the future, Germany would use its full strength to control the West to prevent French retaliation. China would control the East to provide mutual assistance. Mr. Yao believed that the Germans' move was sincere. The Germans wanted to control the whole of Europe and had no time to invade the East. This move was like using other people's strength, benefiting others and benefiting oneself, without malicious intent. He was very happy. He expressed concern that other countries would interfere. Bismarck also said that if international cooperation was inconvenient, the two countries could use commercial capital to sign contracts for commercial cooperation. The government would be the initiator behind the scenes, so there would be no problem. Mr. Yao was overjoyed and told the envoy. Mr. Hong thought that the matter was too important and did not dare to decide. He telegraphed the central government. At that time, Li Hongzhang was in power and did not dare to make a decision on his own. He reported the matter to the emperor. The Qing emperor also thought that the matter was too risky, so the discussion was shelved. Mr. Yao received the telegram and was unhappy for days. He told Bismarck about it. Bismarck also sighed in vain. In recent days, British and Japanese imperialism have been invading more and more. Our country is like meat on a cutting board, at the mercy of others. The Germans failed in the European War and were unable to recover. The reason for their failure was still the lack of raw materials. However, Duan was willing to declare war on Germany in alliance with the Entente Powers because of the loans for participating in the war. I would like to ask what achievements can be said to be achieved other than sacrificing tens of thousands of Chinese laborers and incurring debts of 30 million. Although Mr. Sun Yat-sen of the South strongly opposed it, it was ultimately ineffective. Therefore, we know how far-sighted Bismarck's vision was and how Mr. Ziliang's diplomatic skills compare to those of today's diplomats.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Recent News of a 253-Year-Old Man <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yuanliang</p>
<p>The news of the discovery of a 253-year-old man in Sichuan has spread far and wide. The Shanghai Pictorial even found a photo of him and published it in the newspaper. Many readers were also happy to see it.</p>
<p>However, because of the remote mountains and rivers, there has been no news about this old man for a long time. It is not known whether he is still alive. Recently, a certain lawyer from Sichuan who had just returned to Shanghai from his hometown gave a very detailed account of the old man's recent situation. It is written as follows for those who are concerned.</p>
<p>The lawyer's home is in Wanxian, and he recently returned to Sichuan to visit relatives. The old man lives in Kaizhou. The road is not far away. Because of an old family relationship, he was specially invited to his home and stayed for five days, eating and sleeping together. He observed his situation and asked about his secrets to longevity. According to him, the old man was from the middle years of the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty. He was from Guizhou. He came from a humble background. At the age of thirteen, he went out to collect medicine. He went into the deep mountains and out of the jungles. He had seen all kinds of tigers and leopards. He had been on the verge of death countless times. He had passed through Shaanxi, Gansu, Inner and Outer Mongolia, and Xinjiang. He had endured extreme cold and heat and suffered hardships. Later, he came to Kaizhou. Because of his old age and weakness, he settled there. He usually eats like a normal person. When he is hungry, he eats a lot. When he is not hungry, he often does not eat for several days. When he sleeps, he curls up like a bow. He sleeps lightly. Sometimes he does not sleep all night, and he sits upright in bed, like an old monk in meditation. Sometimes he is tired and sleeps, and the amount of sleep exceeds that of a normal person. However, when he sits, he must sit upright, without leaning or lying down. As the old saying goes, "sit like a bell." However, the old man's actions are extremely slow, like the stage steps of an old-fashioned drama civil official. His fingernails are very long and neatly arranged. It is very inconvenient to take things. Although the old man had little education in his youth, he was naturally intelligent and had a lot of experience. He is very clear about the warmth and dryness of medicinal properties, the cold and heat of the human body, and the changes in the climate. Patients ask him questions, and he can often cure them with one medicine. People are always grateful to him. He said that there is no secret to longevity, but he feels that he has always been open-minded, regardless of honor or disgrace. When he is hungry, he eats. When he is thirsty, he drinks. He treats people and handles things without harsh words or stern expressions. Today, people in Sichuan speculate that an old man of such a high age is rare in the world, let alone in China. He is a national treasure. This old man knows the properties of medicine, can cure diseases, and eats whatever is available and does not compete with the world. Therefore, he is beyond scientific civilization and enjoys a long life alone. Some say that the old man obtained a treasure that prolongs life when he was collecting medicine. Therefore, he has a floating and immortal state. Is that really the case? The lawyer initially planned to bring him to Shanghai, but the old man was not used to traveling by boat and car and disliked the noise of the sea. He declined and left.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Strange Tale of Being Struck by Lightning <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Liqin</p>
<p>Yesterday, my maternal uncle came to Shanghai from his hometown. He spoke of a strange tale of being struck by lightning. Although it borders on superstition, it is enough to make the wicked and treacherous lose their chopsticks upon hearing it. Therefore, I do not hesitate to expend words to present it.</p>
<p>One day last month, the autumn heat was particularly severe. In the afternoon, dark clouds gathered. Soon after, heavy rain poured down, accompanied by thunder and lightning. At that time, in a certain village in Danyang, two or three farm women were bailing water from a river to irrigate their fields. Because the rain came suddenly, they did not have time to take shelter. Then, with a clap of thunder, it was said that all the farm women had been struck by lightning. Upon investigation afterward, it was found that only one person had actually been struck and killed. The other women had not been struck. They said that when the lightning suddenly struck, they were shocked and fainted. They only felt the smell of sulfur filling their nostrils. When they woke up and opened their eyes, they were crawling more than ten feet away. Only a certain woman was struck and killed, lying charred and stiff next to the waterwheel. The villagers found it strange. They all said that the women were in the same place, but the Thunder God only struck one person and, moreover, caused the surviving women to unknowingly move away from the spot. There must be a cause and effect. Several days later, the villagers again declared that the husband of the woman who was struck by lightning confessed his wife's sins to everyone. He said that his wife had long coveted the property of her younger brother. Her younger brother had been married for a long time but had no children. The wife thought that in the future, her son would inherit the property and continue the family line. Unexpectedly, last year, her brother's wife became pregnant and gave birth this spring. The wife pretended to help with the delivery but secretly devised a poisonous plan. When the newborn baby cried upon hitting the ground, she crushed its testicles. The newborn died instantly from the crushing. The wife pretended to be the spokesperson for her brother's wife, saying that the baby died as soon as it was born. The brother's wife believed it and only lamented her bad luck. Now, being struck by lightning must be divine retribution. Although these words are far-fetched, the speaker is earnest, and they come from her husband, so they may be credible. Therefore, those in the world who habitually use dark and evil tricks, upon reflecting on this matter, might they also know to be wary?</p>

<p>— Ping Yun</p>
<p>▲ A Record of Doctor Hồ's Melody: Since the advent of sound film, musical and dance films have become extremely popular. (Lili Damita) was one of the earliest releases, hailed as a leader in this genre. Bebe Daniels' name spread throughout the world as a result. The two comedic stars in the film, Wheeler and Woolsey, were also greatly praised by the world. The two were originally famous actors who played these two roles in Florenz Ziegfeld's stage play (Lili Damita). They have been doing this for three years, so they are familiar with it and feel more than competent. Recently, RKO Pictures, recognizing their popularity, urged them to take on the leading roles in the film "Cuckoos" (Doctor Hồ's Melody). Their comedy is even more outstanding than before, complemented by more than a dozen kinds of melodious songs and dances for embellishment, and dyed with natural color, extremely rich and resplendent. When it premiered in the United States, it caused a sensation across the country, and everyone praised it. It is now heard that this film has been acquired by the Dahua Hotel's open-air cinema and will be publicly screened tonight. The cool weather is not cold yet, so it's a great opportunity to entertain the eyes and ears. (Ping)</p>
<p>▲ A Record of Spiritual and Physical Conflict: The film Spiritual and Physical Conflict is produced by the German UFA company. The leading actors are the European actress Dida Barro, known for both her beauty and acting skills, and Lars Hanson, the male lead in (Flesh and the Devil) and (The Torrent). It depicts love and friendship. The plot is slightly similar to (Flesh and the Devil), but the acting is even better. The whole drama is full of moving romance and surprising tragedy. It is passionate and profound, unprecedented. It depicts the pain of longing in two places, enough to make emotional men and women shed tears of sympathy. And the final scene of returning home to face changes is especially impeccable. In short, the plot of this drama is quite suitable for the viewing habits of Easterners. It is said that when it premiered in a large theater in Japan recently, it was extended for three weeks, and the box office did not decline slightly. This can be seen in the success of the film. It is said that the film is currently being screened at the Paris Grand Theater. (Yun)</p>
<h3 id="e191">The Roman Catholic Church's Dissent Regarding Chinese Rites and Customs (Middle) <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Li Liuzeng, sent from Paris</p>
<p>However, at this time, Father Verbiest of the Jesuit sect in Beijing, due to his contributions to astronomy, regained his freedom and was appointed as the director of the astronomical observatory on April 1, 1669. Therefore, the Jesuit sect quickly regained its former power, while the Dominicans spread propaganda in Rome against France and the Jesuits. At that time, the Jansenists who surrounded King Louis XIV of France in Paris were also afraid that the success of the Jesuits in China would lead to their power infiltrating the French court, which would be detrimental to their future. Therefore, they vehemently attacked them. At that time, almost everyone who entered and exited the Palace of Versailles used Confucius and Chinese customs as topics of discussion. The great writer Saint-Simon also recorded this event in his "Memoirs." The gist of it was that the Jesuits recognized the worship of ancestors and Confucius by the Chinese as a kind of civilized custom, while other sects regarded it as superstition and idolatry, and argued incessantly.</p>
<p>The Jesuits in Beijing, knowing the seriousness of the situation regarding this issue in Rome and Paris, decided to express their opinions to the Qing Emperor Kangxi and Chinese ministers. On November 30, 1700, Emperor Kangxi declared the Jesuit interpretation to be correct. However, the Roman Catholic Church considered the testimony of the Chinese emperor who worshiped idols to be untrustworthy. Pope Clement XI issued an order on November 20, 1704, affirming that Chinese rites and customs were not civilized customs but a kind of superstition. However, this order was not made public but was only secretly delivered to the Papal Legate to China, Mgr de Tournon.</p>
<p>After countless twists and turns, on August 2, 1706, Emperor Kangxi summoned representatives of the two factions to the Rehe Imperial Villa, allowing them to debate the points of contention face to face. Subsequently, Emperor Kangxi personally arbitrated. Roughly speaking, one, the Chinese (Heaven) is the same as the Catholic (God). Two, the ritual of worshiping Confucius is not a kind of sacrifice (culte) but a kind of homage to a sage (hommage). Three, the meaning of worshiping ancestors is the same as the meaning of worshiping Confucius. Both of these do not conflict with the Catholic faith.</p>
<p>However, Emperor Kangxi's arbitration was as ineffective as the declaration of 1900. The dispute did not subside as a result. On January 25, 1707, Papal Legate de Tournon even read out a document in Nanjing refuting Emperor Kangxi's arbitration. Therefore, on April 1, Kangxi issued an edict prohibiting any missionary who did not accept the Jesuit interpretation of Chinese rites and customs from preaching in China.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Green Bamboo Tears Stain Her Heart, Red Lotus Fragrance Fades as a Young Woman's Soul Departs</p>
<p>For the first month and a half, Cuiyun's business was very good. If she continued like that, she could gradually pay off her debts. Without debts, she would be even more free. As the saying goes, "Having a son makes everything complete, being debt-free makes life easy." In the brothel, just change one word, and it becomes "Having customers makes everything complete, being debt-free makes life easy." At that time, her father, Wu the silversmith, who had not been in contact for a long time, also came to recognize his daughter. Originally, Cuiyun had a lot of filial thoughts. Although she felt a bit of resentment towards her parents for being tricked into Shanghai by Sister A Xiu and being forced into a brothel, she thought that her old father was an honest man, and it was all her stepmother's doing. Moreover, she knew that Sister A Xiu was in cahoots with her stepmother. She still felt sorry for her father. In the past, it wasn't her own body, so there was no need to communicate with her father. Now that she could have a little autonomy, she asked someone to write a letter to her father, asking him to come to Shanghai to stay for a few days. Wu the silversmith couldn't have been happier to receive this letter. It was truly like "Hearing the invitation is like receiving a general's command." However, Cuiyun didn't mention her stepmother at all and didn't ask her to come to Shanghai with her father. That stepmother was still grumbling in front of the old man, saying that if it weren't for Sister A Xiu, how could she have today? She used to hate us, saying that we harmed her by making her eat brothel rice and ruining her life. Since that's the case, now that she's redeemed herself, she shouldn't eat brothel rice anymore. She should try to make a name for herself. Why does she still need to open a room? At this moment, she looked like she was serious. The old man ignored her, knowing that his daughter hadn't mentioned her in the letter. He secretly thought that his daughter still recognized him as her father. When he arrived in Shanghai, his daughter let him stay at her business place and treated him well every day. Knowing that her father liked to drink a little wine, she invited him to drink every day. Nothing is better than a cup in hand. After a drunken stupor, there were no problems. Because Cuiyun didn't have a small house, the old man had to sleep casually in the toilet at her business place. According to Cuiyun's intention, it was like preparing a sedan chair to welcome and support him. She didn't want him to go back to Kunshan again. However, Wu the silversmith, with his nature from the mountains and fields, couldn't get used to the extravagant atmosphere. He still wanted to retire and return to his hometown. Cuiyun made him several sets of clothes and also bought him many foods that were not readily available inland, such as assorted biscuits, for the old man to stave off hunger, and Cantonese sausages, for him to have with his wine. When Wu the silversmith returned to his township, everyone envied him. He had truly become a glorious homecoming. But he still didn't forget his affection for his wife and tried his best to mediate for Cuiyun's stepmother, saying that Sister A Xiu seduced you to go out in the first place, and your stepmother was also tricked. However, Sister A Xiu is hateful, but she owes her current status to her. He also whispered that your stepmother's lover died last year.</p>

Both official and unofficial foreign exchange rates eased, with a spread of one and a half tiers. Arbitrage activities were limited, and buying and selling were not uncommon in the market. However, due to different psychological factors among various firms, the inflow and outflow of funds varied significantly. In the early market, Zhifeng, Yushui, Dabingxing, and others all sold, while Dadecheng, Fuchang, Hengxing, and others all sought to buy. Since the opening price was seen to rise, especially with sellers being more aggressive, the market opened lower and continued to weaken. Previously, there were rumors that the United States and India were selling large quantities of silver bars. However, according to yesterday's telegrams, they were actually buying. Thus, people's confidence turned out to be unfounded. Later, buyers flocked in, and the market turned peaceful. Prices jumped from within 53 taels to outside 56 taels, then slightly dropped by one or two taels. Subsequently, the market was firm and then declined again, but the fluctuations were only two taels. There were no large transactions on the table. Finally, the price was above 56 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Opened Down 2.8 Taels in the Morning: The opening price for October this morning was 555 taels and 8 qian, a decrease of 2 taels and 8 qian. This was because the silver bars were 1/8 longer, while the silver price was 1/2 longer, and the gross margin was slightly more than one tael higher or lower. It had reached 56 taels and 1 or 2 qian. Subsequently, Zhifeng, Yongtaiheng, Yuanyuan, and others eagerly sold off, and the atmosphere was depressed, so the price gradually dropped by more than three taels, eventually falling to 52 taels and 4 or 5 qian. Before long, it rebounded by one tael. Although the telegraph reported an increase of 3.75 for sterling, 0.75 for US dollars, and a decrease of 0.0225 for Japanese yen, it had no impact because the prices had already been lowered before the posting. Moreover, Fuchang and Dadecheng were buying. At that time, it rebounded by a small 3 qian. Hengxing bought again, and the internal drafts seemed firm. Huashang Bank traded 7.25 pence for November sterling, and Maike Bank bought US dollars at 39.9375 yuan for December at 40 yuan. Therefore, it immediately rose by more than three taels, reaching 56 taels and 7 qian after 10 o'clock. In an instant, someone sold, and it was reduced by 2 taels. At 10:30, it was 4 taels and 5 or 6 qian. Before 11 o'clock, it rose by 2 taels, to 56 taels and 6 qian. Afterward, Huabi issued recent Japanese yen at 1.2475 taels. The market situation returned to stagnation, but people's minds were confused, and there was a potential increase of one tael, reaching 54 taels and 7 qian. By the time the market closed at noon, it was 55 taels and 1 qian.</p>
<p>▲ More Buying in the Afternoon, Slightly Rebounding: The afternoon market opened at 56 taels and 6 qian, which was the remaining momentum from the noon closing, and Shunli and others bought in. Subsequently, it continued to rise. Yuancheng and Yongfuchang chased after purchases, reaching 58 taels and 6 qian after 2:30. The drafts were also good. Maike Bank and Korea traded US dollars at 39.5625 yuan for this month, and banks mutually traded at 39.875 yuan for November. By the end of the session, sellers had become active, so after 3 o'clock, it retreated to 6 taels and 6 qian. Later, it rebounded by one tael, reaching 7 taels and 7 qian at 4 o'clock. However, because the supply did not continue, it eventually softened. At the 4:30 closing, it was 56 taels and 4 qian, a decrease of 2 taels and 2 qian compared to the fourth day.</p>
<p>▲ Posted Price Pressed Down to 54-55 Taels: The highest price for the day was 58 taels and 6 qian, and the lowest price was 52 taels and 4 qian, a difference of 6 taels and 2 qian. The posted price was changed to 611 taels and 4 qian in the morning, which was a small decrease of 0.0225 for Japanese yen. The initial press was down to slightly less than 58 taels, then 54 taels, and 55-56 taels at noon. In the afternoon, it was pressed down to slightly less than 54-55 taels. The registration was from 66 taels to 55 taels, and the supplementary water was 66 taels, and 67 taels in the afternoon. Goods were 6 taels in the early market, 5 taels and 7 qian at noon, and 6 taels and 7 qian in the afternoon, with a closing price of 5 taels and 8 qian.</p>
<p>▲ Complex Transactions Among Various Firms: Dadecheng, Yuancheng Yong, Yuanmaoyong, Yuanxingyong, Xieyu, Senchangyong, and others had uncertain inflows and outflows. Fuchang, Taikangrun, Yuanheng, Hengxing, Shunli, Wanxing, and others all bought in. Zhifengyong, Yuancheng Yuan, Dayong, Yuda, Bingxing, Taihengyuan, and others all sold. There were also buy-ins from hedging firms. In the afternoon, Yuanxingyong and Yongchengchang had inconsistent inflows and outflows. Wanxing, Fuchang, Shunli, Yuancheng Yong, and retail investors all bought in. Yuandayong, Zhifengyong, Hengxing, Yifengyong, and others all sold out. The Dalian group bought 2,500 bars, while selling 2-300 bars. Hedging bars had more short positions than long positions, with 4-5,000 bars bought in. The Guangdong group bought in first and then sold out, but the quantity was not large.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Both Official and Unofficial Foreign Exchange Rates Eased <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's posted exchange rates suddenly increased by one and a half tiers. Since the increase last Friday, there had been no changes. Looking back now, the increase happened again after a week. Sterling increased by 3.75, to 1 shilling and 7.25 pence; US dollars increased by 0.75, to 39 yuan; Indian rupees increased by 2 yuan, to 108 rupees; French francs increased by 19 yuan, to 992 yuan; German marks increased by 3 yuan, to 163.5 marks; Japanese yen increased by 1.75 yuan, to 96.75 guilders; Singapore dollars decreased by 3 taels, to 144.25 taels; Japanese yen decreased by 0.0225, to 1 tael and 2.675 qian; Hong Kong dollars remained at 83.5 taels. This was affected by the rebound in overseas silver markets. As for bank transactions, the price initially seemed loose, then eased, and finally stagnated in the afternoon. As a result, compared to the previous day, shillings increased by 1.25, US dollars increased by 0.1875, and Japanese yen decreased slightly by 0.0225. The price of gold continued to weaken. People's sentiments trended lower, and trading by Chinese merchants was not very active. However, there were quite a few internal trades among banks. About 100,000 pounds of sterling were traded, with Chinese merchants selling a few tens of thousands of pounds. Maikali absorbed it, and 1-200,000 US dollars were also sold. Sumitomo Bank bought it, and various banks mutually traded 2-300,000 yuan. The Dalian group slightly bought in tens of thousands of yuan of Dalian notes, which were sold by Mitsui Huabi and others. This was probably because the price of silver was not expected to fall. There were rumors that the United States and others were selling large quantities of raw silver. Now, it is learned that telegrams indicate that there is no such thing, or there may be news of buying.</p>
<p>▲ Sterling: Internal market fluctuated by 0.0625. In the morning, the asking price for this month was 1 shilling and 7.5 pence, 5.125 for October, 6.25 for November, and 6.875 for December.

<h3 id="e198">Sharp Decline Resumes in Yarn and Yarn Market <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is very weak, and the decline is quite severe, mainly due to sluggish sales of spot yarn, continuous domestic wars, and the bleak situation in the world cotton industry. The Chaozhou gang is selling off aggressively, and retail investors are shaken. Bulls are showing signs of uneasiness, leading to vulnerabilities. However, the price of third-grade yarn has been relatively stable recently. Judging from the overall situation, it will be difficult to maintain the 50 tael mark. It is reported that large investors who shorted previously have been offsetting with huge amounts daily. Although there has been a large amount of buying, it is difficult to reverse the downward trend in the short term.</p>
<p>▲ Marked Yarn Suffers Uniform Decline　The pre-market opening for marked yarn saw low morale and persistent selling pressure. Only some investors covered their short positions, but the market atmosphere remained weak. Prices fell by 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 cash. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere was extremely weak. The current month fell by 1.1 taels, and the far month fell by 5, 6, 7, and 9 cash. The total trading volume for the day was 17,950 bales. Yuda bought 3,200 bales, and Heshen, Yiyu, Rongxing, Hanfeng, Hengde, Yongchang, Tianlong, Shenji, Yicheng, Changfeng, Hengchang, Xiesheng, and Xingyuan bought 300 to 450 bales each. Daji sold 7 bales, Taixing 650 bales, Tongyu 650 bales, and Hengyi, Gengfeng, Tongxing, Yuantai, Taichang, Tianchang, Deji, Dafu, Maoji, Rongxing, Ruida, Senkang, and Yiyu sold 300 to 500 bales each. The closing prices for marked yarn are recorded below:</p>

<p>The cotton market has turned weak, and the decline is quite severe, mainly because the fundamentals are not good, making it difficult to stabilize. This situation was reported by this newspaper earlier. The current cotton business is unusually dull, and factories have no intention of activity. Furthermore, the world cotton industry is still weakening. Therefore, most people's morale is low. Now that the weather has cleared and foreign exchange rates have eased, both retail investors and bulls are showing signs of panic. In the afternoon, the market situation was extremely weak, but the Han gang has not yet shown a large number of sell-offs. New cotton from various regions is gradually entering the market, but American cotton is relatively stable. However, the upward momentum is still lacking. Most people predict that if the weather does not change after the White Dew Festival, there will still be significant changes in the future.</p>
<p>▲ Han Marked Cotton Falls　The pre-market opening for Han marked cotton saw persistent rain, and market prices were still firm. Later, as the sun came out, the market price fell sharply, and the closing was even more severe, with declines of 3 to 3.5 cash. In the afternoon, the weather cleared, retail investors panicked, and prices fell by 1 cash across all months. The total trading volume for the day was 45,900 dan. Hengyi sold 3,500 dan, Zhuqiaofeng 2,800 dan, Dachangcheng 2,700 dan, and Jifeng, Heshen, Meiji, Rongxing, Hanfeng, and Qinfeng sold 1,000 to 1,600 dan each.

<p>▲ American Cotton Continues to Improve　Yesterday, the American cotton market was mixed due to anticipation of the government report.

British cotton futures rose by 1 point, and spot prices rose by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. Indian cotton initially rose with American cotton, but later strengthened due to bullish local buying. Pinggouer and Bailuoxi rose by 3 rupees, and Aomula rose by 2 rupees.

<h3 id="e201">Grain: More Jiangxi Xian Arrives, Prices Rise Slightly <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>▲ Xiang Yuan Initially Opened at 320 Bags, Price 18.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, another batch of Jiangxi rice arrived, and the market became even more depressed. Both the Northern Gang and inland areas had no appetite. Only the local streets, due to the high price of Du rice, found customer Xian rice to be more cost-effective, and their intentions were good. The total market transaction was 2,000 bags of early-season Jiangxi machine rice, priced at 13.85 yuan and 13 yuan, down to 12.6 yuan; 700 bags of late-season machine rice, priced at 15.8 yuan, 15 yuan, down to 14.23 yuan. Also, 80 bags of Hunan machine rice were sold at 13.5 yuan to 13.3 yuan. The Northern Gang's intentions were weak, and the Tianjin Gang was also watching and not moving. Yesterday, Xiang machine Yuan was dealt with at 320 bags, priced at 18.5 yuan, down to 17.8 yuan. Xiang Yuan rice grains are very large and have sufficient upward potential, so they are welcomed by local customers. This was the first time this batch of goods was sold, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Small Broken Rice Shipped Back from Hankou in Batches <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Although the inventory of foreign rice is small, it is being squeezed by Jiangxi rice, and the market is quite weak. Transactions are also declining. The existing inventory in the market, except for Saigon No. 1, is all low-grade goods. Local streets have little appetite for low-grade goods. Only the Ningbo and Shaoxing gangs among the customer gangs may welcome it, but they are also being squeezed by Xiang and Gan rice. Yesterday, 300 bags of broken Da grain were sold at 11.95 yuan, down 4 to 5 fen from the previous day. Also, the small broken rice previously shipped to Hankou was difficult to sell due to the influx of Xiang rice in that area, and a batch was shipped back yesterday. The asking price was above 15 yuan, and no deal was reached due to disagreements with the shippers. However, the cost for that gang must be above 17 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Flour Market Suddenly Turns Downstream <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, both the current month and distant months were initially stable. However, after the second round, it gradually softened. This is because the quotation for foreign wheat has continued to decline by 2 to 3 jiao, and the pricing of foreign flour is indeed becoming cheaper. It is rumored that 3.95 yuan has already received a reply confirming the price, and 3.9 yuan is still under negotiation. As for the pricing of foreign wheat, Japanese merchants, taking advantage of the surplus tonnage on the Pacific, are offering discounts on shipping and touting No. 2 foreign wheat, opening at only 5.2 taels. Shanghai factories are countering with a price of 5 taels. Based on the current situation, this may become a reality. Because of this, each round in the afternoon was weaker than in the morning. Once foreign flour and wheat become cheap, even if those holding long positions want to resist further, they will feel overwhelmed. Therefore, the subsequent decline will depend on the pricing of foreign flour and wheat. As a result, the current month was down by 1 fen, October down by 2 fen, November down by 2 fen and 2.5 li, December down by 1.5 fen, and January down by 1 fen and 2.5 li, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Wheat Market Finds No Progress <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>▲ Foreign Wheat Reported Lower, Flour Sales Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, the various months were generally stable, with little change from the previous day's closing price. By the time the afternoon session opened, the market felt depressed due to the weakness of the flour market and rumors that the pricing of foreign wheat was about to be finalized. Market sentiment became even weaker, and buying interest was even more subdued. The various months also declined by 1 to 2 fen in light trading. If foreign wheat becomes cheaper and factories indeed cancel their orders, the price of wheat will naturally be affected. As a result, the current month was down by 1 fen compared to the previous day, October down by 1 fen, November down by 2 fen, December down by 1 fen, January down by 2 fen, and February was not opened. Currently, factories are still unwilling to budge, and the market is stagnant. Only 620 bags of inferior Shashi wheat were opened throughout the day at 4 taels 5 qian and 7 fen, and have not yet been allocated to factories, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Sugar Market: Rising Trend of Japanese Sugar Slightly Weakens <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw telegrams from producing areas reporting that the price of Cuban spot sugar was 1.15625, a slight decrease of 0.0625 compared to the previous telegram. The price of New York sugar futures for September remained at 1.12, December at 1.19, down 2 points, March of next year at 1.39, and May at 1.39, also down 1 point each. The price of Javanese spot sugar was 8.875, futures sugar for September at 8.8125, October at 8.625, November at 8.50, with only a slight increase of 0.0625 for the current month compared to the previous telegram, and no changes for the remaining months. In the public market, the buying interest in Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was sluggish, and transactions were few and far between. Ordinary goods were priced at 8 taels, and slightly higher ones at 8 taels and 1 qian. The market was flat and unremarkable. The Japanese sugar market also turned stable. This is because shipments continued to arrive, and after the previous surge in white sugar prices in various places, many were taking a wait-and-see approach. However, the Dali Factory market did not sell on return telegrams, so the market was still able to stand. S.H. brand opened at 8 taels to the price of 8 taels, and later at 8 taels 1 qian and 2.5 fen. N brand initially opened at 8 taels and 0.05 fen, YT brand at 8 taels and 0.075 fen, YP brand at 8 taels 1 qian and 7.5 fen, and J brand at 8 taels 2 qian and 7.5 fen. Transactions were not smooth, and the market appeared to have fallen back by 2.5 fen compared to the previous day. The trademark numbers Zhenxiang and Jinfeng opened spot coarse granulated white sugar at more than 2,000 bags, priced at 8 taels each. Because the total amount was nearly 20,000 bags, and the bank's intention to buy was very weak, it was not easy to sell them all at once, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Dried Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Rises Another 5 Qian <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>▲ Two Batches of Newly Dried Meat Arrive</p>
<p>▲ Longkou Vermicelli Due to the scarcity of goods in the previous market, the price once opened at 19.5 taels. However, the source of supply has remained lacking in recent days, so the trend has tightened again. Yesterday, it was reported that another batch of customer goods opened, with the price rising to 20 taels. Therefore, the selling prices of various firms have uniformly increased accordingly. Furthermore, the movement of various gangs has been lively in recent days, and the market is feared to tighten further.</p>
<p>▲ Newly Dried Round Meat The first batch has already been sold. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Dachang Wheel arrived in Shanghai from Xiamen, bringing a second batch of more than 20 pieces in total. If the goods are of high quality, the market price should not fluctuate excessively, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Piece Goods: Customer Sales Active, Prices Frequently Rise <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The piece goods market situation continued to trend upwards yesterday. The liveliness of the cotton cloth market is unprecedented this year. Yoshida &amp; Co. opened more than 300 pieces of Yuehua velvet, colored stripes, fine whipcord, etc., all with yesterday's cash settlement. The good market sentiment was rare. Large-pattern Yuehua velvet opened at 1 qian 9 fen and 5 li, medium-pattern Yuehua velvet at 1 qian 9 fen and 2.5 li, and small-pattern at 1 qian 8 fen and 5 li. Thick French velvet rose by 5 li yesterday. Dharma Lion concubine color at 2 qian 6 fen, white at 2 qian 5 fen. Those holding fine whipcord were hoarding and refusing to sell. Fellow traders were very eager to buy. It is said that although the price has risen by more than 1 fen in the past three days, it is still about 1 fen cheaper than tribute cloth and satin from the lower classes. Therefore, there is a unanimous expectation of further price increases. The Sichuan gang, which sells for actual use, also shows signs of activity. Yesterday, they telegraphed to buy more than 100 pieces. The Tianjin, Qingdao, Xuzhou, and Ningbo gangs were also quite active. Inland wholesalers are also very busy due to the arrival of the autumn season, and the price of goods shows a strong upward trend, it is said.</p>

<p>The East White Iron trade has seen increased transactions among customer gangs in recent days, so the volume being opened is quite considerable. Therefore, the market has also turned from weak to strong. It is estimated that each 36-inch sheet is worth 9 qian and 4 fen, and each 37-inch sheet is worth 1 tael 1 qian and 3 fen. It is reported that 2,500 to 2,600 sheets were opened yesterday, it is said.</p>

He came to Shanghai and reached an agreement with Hanli Company to transport a large number of printing machines back to Siam for sale. It is heard that Mr. Luo is an old friend of Mr. Zhongling, a classmate from Lingnan, and they are very close. Recently, he has been contracting to build railways in 14 provinces of Siam, with strong capital, the most influential, and a high reputation.

<p>▲Lianmei Store at the intersection of Fada Road and Dongxin Bridge Street declares that it has been established for more than ten years and has a well-established reputation. Due to insufficient housing, a new three-story Western-style building has been built, with luxurious decorations, and has now been completed.

<p>▲Fushang Road Baixing Grand Theater declares that the Russian revolutionary passionate war tragic giant film "Storm" recently screened at the theater is starred by John Barrymore, a famous star on the stage and in the film industry. It describes the disputes between the White and Red parties, the brutal policies of the Communist Party, and the great exposure of harassment. The intensity of the war and the passionate love are all endlessly fascinating to the audience. Therefore, despite the stormy weather in recent days, the audience at the theater is still extremely crowded.</p>
<p>▲YMCA declares that "A Mother's Heart" is a foreign film. The content is roughly about a wealthy woman who has fallen into decline, raising young children, marrying a daughter-in-law and having grandchildren, but her daughter-in-law is unfilial and even leaves her husband to remarry. The daughter-in-law's later experiences are full of frustration. Karma comes around, and retribution is sure. The plot is bizarre and extremely tortuous. In today's society, people are frivolous. Watching this film will surely move people and inspire them. The heart of maternal love and filial piety will arise spontaneously, and it is especially sufficient to give a shot in the arm to women who are fond of luxury and romance. The association has specially leased the film at a high price because of its relevance to morality and public sentiment. It will be screened in the auditorium of the association at 8:00 pm this Saturday. Tickets are only two cents of silver. The association's place is spacious, and the air is fresh, which is unmatched by ordinary cinemas. All those who care about social education or have a film addiction should not miss this good opportunity.</p>
<p>▲Jimei Film Company declares that the new film "Fearless Death" is a hilarious comedy, song, dance, and martial arts blockbuster.

The film has now been completely completed. The company has noted that there are several scenes of great new-style song and dance in the film. It has specially discussed with the actors of the film to organize a Jimei song and dance troupe, hiring experts to guide them, and creating complete talents in the song and dance world. Since the training, several months have passed, and now they are gradually proficient, performing in a novel way, which is unmatched by other performances on stage. Various ports in South China have sent people to the company to contact them.</p>
<p>▲Paris Grand Theater declares that the long-rumored film "The Conflict of Soul and Flesh" has already been screened yesterday. The film is produced by Ufa Film Company, and the plot is slightly similar to "Flesh and the Devil", but the structure and expression are even more so. This is truly a rare work in modern silent films. The first show yesterday was sold out before two and a half hours had passed. The subsequent two shows were also full. The audience was very satisfied with the film.</p>

All advertising decorations were handled by artists and were quite ingenious, costing a considerable amount. Every evening, eyesight and memory tests were conducted, and various items were given away, also at great expense. In the past six days, more than 9,000 fans, more than 3,000 beauty pictures, more than 7,000 bottles of perfume, more than 1,000 towels, and more than 30 cosmetic boxes have been given away. Including the cost of decoration, the total cost is approximately over four or five thousand yuan. However, based on the proportion of people tested, only about one in two or three hundred people got all the answers correct. Most people could only answer about five or six correctly. This shows that the eyesight and physical strength of our people are mostly ordinary and should be quickly supplemented with Buliduo.</p>

<h3 id="e238">Guangxi Folk Literature <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Zengyang</p>
<p>Edited by Qu Duren</p>
<p>Most of the systematically organized collections of folk literature published by major publishers at sea today are taken from eastern Guangdong or remote Sichuan. There has been no collection of "Guangxi Folk Literature," which is very remote. Therefore, scholars who study folk literature generally regret not being able to understand the customs and temperament of the people of Guangxi. Recently, the folk literature of this region, compiled by Mr. Qu, is active before our eyes, making up for the shortcomings of Chinese people not being able to understand each other's folk customs. In the editor's preface, he described this point very thoroughly: "Although Guangxi also occupies a piece of China's territory, because of its remote location, compared to the journey in the minds of most Chinese people, mentioning Guangxi seems even less convenient than mentioning England or America. In fact, there are fewer Chinese people who go to Guangxi than to England or America. Guangxi is buried in the corners of most Chinese people's brain banks along with words like the Sahara Desert and the North and South Poles." This is a very obvious fact, because people who live in the central regions, except for those who have special circumstances, rarely run to a corner of Guangxi without a purpose. But because it is buried by most people, when they occasionally think of it—Guangxi—"they also feel the same mysterious interest as the Sahara Desert and the North and South Poles, and all kinds of illusions such as miasmas spreading across the wilderness, Miao and Yao people in groups, green faces and sharp teeth... are linked together. The nickname 'Secret Western Country' given to Guangxi by most Chinese people expresses this meaning. Guangxi is buried by the Chinese people because of its remote location, and because it has always been buried, it has been felt by the Chinese people with a mysterious interest. Therefore, Guangxi also has a tendency to be re-excavated from the corners of the Chinese people's brain banks for research." This is indeed an extremely good phenomenon. Therefore, when we study the folk literature left in various places to this day, we must first start with the folk libraries in these border areas that are not easily accessible. This is also the concept of "generality," and things that are considered difficult to obtain in the eyes of the Chinese are always particularly precious. The so-called literature is, of course, the same. In fact, this concept is not wrong, perhaps it is learned from experience.</p>
<p>The editor is very careful and divides the contents of this book into six parts. The first and second parts are both about love. Because the meaning of "sex" is relatively heavy in the second part, the editor, not afraid of the trouble, specially opened up a column for it, that is, dividing it into "Love" (upper) and "Love" (lower). The third part, "Women," describes the lives of women. The fourth part, "Farmers," describes rural life. The fifth part is "Nursery Rhymes," and the sixth part is "Miscellaneous." Such a systematic classification can also be regarded as a unique feature of this compilation, making readers feel extra convenient when chanting and clearly understand the content described, for example:</p>
<p>If brother has the heart and sister has the heart,</p>
<p>We are not afraid of high mountains and deep waters,</p>
<p>There are still people walking on high mountains,</p>
<p>There are ferries in deep waters.</p>
<p>Such a love song, rich in clear and simple beauty, and containing profound implications, is indeed rare in ordinary published collections of love songs. It is truly a beautiful and moving good song.</p>
<p>From this collection, we see the psychology of the people of Guangxi. The era is very far away, probably because of the inconvenience of transportation, and new ideas cannot be universally imported, so to this day, it still retains some old-fashioned thinking, such as:</p>
<p>Rose flowers bloom with rose fragrance,</p>
<p>Swaying and swinging to school,</p>
<p>Husband, ah husband,</p>
<p>Do your homework well,</p>
<p>Don't pick flowers on the road,</p>
<p>There are begonias in your own room.</p>
<p>From this, we can see the expectations of Guangxi women for men. Although this poem is about "love," it also crisscrosses with an upward consciousness, urging the loved one to work hard, but the purpose of the effort is still to make her husband a successful candidate in the imperial examination. However, this concept cannot be generalized, such as:</p>
<p>Husband, you don't have to boast,</p>
<p>How many people enjoy prosperity by studying,</p>
<p>Although my husband is a farmer's son,</p>
<p>He is already at home in the fields at dusk.</p>
<p>This love song also represents another kind of psychology of Guangxi women. This psychology is also because China is a country that values agriculture, so from the most ancient times to the present, there is still a concept of believing in the life of farmers. In this collection of "Folk Literature," there are particularly many descriptions of this kind, such as:</p>
<p>It's really pitiful,</p>
<p>There is no quilt on the bed and no edge on the mat,</p>
<p>There is also no firewood, rice, oil, or salt,</p>
<p>No fish or meat is seen,</p>
<p>Everyone comes to pay New Year's greetings,</p>
<p>The child cries for his mother,</p>
<p>The stomach is as bitter as Coptis chinensis.</p>
<p>This song completely reveals the weakness of the economic power of the people of Guangxi, and it is so that we are moved by listening to it. This is the unique value of "Folk Literature."</p>
<p>Worry comes and goes, worry becomes more and more,</p>
<p>Always guarding against thieves, never resting,</p>
<p>Guarding the night and watching the day,</p>
<p>I wish to hear the early singing of the song of peace.</p>
<p>Readers will generally know that there are really as many bandits in Guangxi as there are tangled hemp. Even these poor farmers are frightened by it, but they also lack the ability to govern and defend themselves. This is a fact. As long as we sing the hopeful cry of this "I wish to hear the early singing of the song of peace," we can certainly believe it without any doubt. At the same time, they have reached the "harvesting period," which is so joyful, obviously seeing the light in "suffering," "In the sixtieth month of the sky, it is the harvesting period, the husband and wife go out and laugh, I will do the threshing and you will do the cutting, now we are not afraid of the hunger of the children." Under such circumstances, it is natural that songs like the above are evoked.</p>
<p>There are also many "Nursery Rhymes" that are worth chanting. Now, I will cite one or two to share with those who have the same interests.</p>
<p>The moon is bright,</p>
<p>Shining into the sister-in-law's room,</p>
<p>The elder brother studies until midnight,</p>
<p>The sister-in-law splits hemp until dawn.</p>
<p>In the senses of children, such an awareness of men diligently reading and women diligently weaving is deeply imprinted. This is also worth considering. There are many other "Nursery Rhymes," but due to the length of the article, it is a pity that I cannot cite them all.</p>
<p>The last part is "Miscellaneous," and there are also many good songs that reveal true feelings. I can only let the readers appreciate them for themselves.</p>
