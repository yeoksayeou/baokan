<p>從前强國之外交手腕以强硬今日强國之外交手腕以柔軟。從前所謂經濟侵略。雖致力於商業上之競爭。然亦必以武力爲輔助。今日之經濟侵略。則專致力於商業之向外發展。而更先之以交歡友好。此固由於歐戰後不得不轉向和平之覺悟。而京由於今日商業不振之潮流所驅迫而然。此友好通商之條約。所以成爲世界最需要之一點也。即以歐洲論。向來休戚相關之國如德奥。近固簽訂通商友好條約。即向來仇對之國如意奥。今亦捐棄前嫌。而成立通商友好條約。又如英俄兩國。自邦交斷絶而後。久議復交未成。近忽實現正式復交。今更進一步而訂定臨時通商協定。是可見今日世界之趨勢。皆在棄舊惡而聯新交。惟兩國間友好之誠意如何。友发時間之久暫如何。則非目前所能揣測。必俟通商後所得切膚之利害何如。而後始能决定也。</p>
<p>溯英俄正式復交之成功。實出於英工黨政府之力。保守黨固至今猶有反對者。惟在當時。英工黨政府。主張先解决各懸案而後復交。俄則要求先復交而後商議懸案。因之交涉。暫告停止。後經英政府承認先行復交。協約乃告成立。故該協約除禁止宣傳一事先行解决外。餘如商務債務漁業等種種問題。均規定於復交後逐步解决。今之簽訂臨時通商條約。即按照復交協約而行者。但其他糾紛之問題尙多。果能事事順利而無障礙否。則又非今日所能料。且英俄之所以急於復交。實迫於商務衰退經濟發生困難之故。然兩國之經濟組織。與主義政策。根本不同。果能友好至若何程度。又須以將來之事實證明之。吾以英俄爲證。可見今日極盛一時之通商友好。亦不過謀解除各人自身之困難。一種暫時結合而已。</p>

<h3 id="c84">敎育方案實施與地方敎育行政　夏承楓 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>在這次全國敎育會議十天的會期中、必能將數十專家經幾個月努力而成功的敎育方案、修正的十分齊整方案的價値、要在開始實施後、纔可逐漸的證明、但實施方案時發生的困難、未尙完全是方案本身的錯誤、於討論方案本身得失的會議中、同時自然要替他開闢一條或數條較關重要的出路、否則近一二十年來、我國舉行的各種敎育會議、不爲不熱鬧、所謂計畫更不能說少、然而祇看見會塲上的歡欣鼓舞和會議報告上的天花亂墜、議决案傳遞到敎育廳長或局長的辦公檯上、重要者無從着手、次要者便輕輕的歸入檔案、至於和個人口味不投的、更不値一笑了、</p>
<p>經騐告訴我們、事實上確有這種現象、這次會議的使命、至少關係到未來二三十年敎育的成敗、對於方案實施過程中的重要關頭、要多加精密的討論、纔可不至有蹈覆轍的危險、所謂過程中先决問題的先决問題、自然是敎育經費的寬籌、但是敎育經費、即在一二年内有突飛猛進的發展、而敎育行政制度、不加一番改革、甚至因經費驟增、管理和使用不當、亦足使一地方的敎育精神、完全破產、作者以爲我們應就敎育現狀的需要注意兩個問題、</p>
<p>（一）應在何處尋找方案實施的着落、</p>
<p>（二）應向何人討取方案實施的回信、</p>
<p>從方案本身說、方案内容、是聯貫中央·省·縣敎育事業高中初一級敎育制度、不應有所重輕、自然各級敎育行政、當局盡是負責人員、然而最複雜而難着手的、要算謀敎育的普及、辦了幾十年而弄得百孔千瘡、急須有切實的方案去改絃更張·或另起爐竈的·亦是普及敎育别的國家不識字人數拿千分之幾計算、我們還老守着十分之幾的數目敎育早一天普及、國家的地位早一天提高、敎育界目前應全力以從事的、亦是普及敎育、譬如說此次的方案、對於普及敎育應另眼看待、當亦非過分要求、</p>
<p>普及敎育的實施、向來是以縣爲單位、執行普及敎育實施的最重要負責者、是縣敎育局長、假如方案通過以後、關於普敎及方案、由敎育部傳遞敎育廳、敎育廳傳遞敎育局、敎育局長仍舊捧着没有辦法而終於歸檔者、不惟枉費了許多專家的心血、地方敎育何日纔有振作之望、敎育局長的捧着没有辦法、不應盡責備他們的不努力、其中原因很多、列舉起來、可以說是、一·本無求進步的决心、二·輔佐人員太少太差、三·經費限制不能放膽前進、四·上級長官無援助、五·敎育界不合作、六·師資紊亂、七·有關係機關掣肘、八·地方封建勢力遇事都爲障礙、九·自身本不滿意作局長、不過暫作退隠或休養打算、十·大部時間用在籌欵排難解紛、維持現狀、已屬心力交瘁、十一·無人指導不敢着手、十二·對敎育根本不了解、十三·····等等、歸納起來說、（一）局長不得人、（二）組織不健全、（三）省敎育行政機關不能負指導保障之責、（四）行政權能甚小、業務範圍過雜、經費和事業兩重責任、集於一身、</p>
<p>多數地方敎育寄生於如此狀態之下、優秀人才、往往稍加嘗試、便望望然而去、祗求一年度内安然無事、已屬難能、而一年中當然仍免不了多少虚驚和隠痛、於是身爲省敎育廳長者、亦往往感覺到地方敎育太麻煩、難有平治的希望、如此狀態、不先設法剷除消滅、而輕輕將關係未來敎育新生命的實施方案、安置於如是環境中、其結果如何、可以預知、回想中國地方敎育的初期、在毫無準備毫無辦法的狀態下、居然從舉貢生員乃至白丁的手中、輕輕的將敎育權接收過來、於是力能自辦敎育的地方、是人自爲政校自爲政鄕自爲政、經濟能力薄弱文化落後的地方、樂得公私都不過問、一縣百里、設校三五、以資點綴、到現在祇看見無標準的畸形發展、祇看見落後的愈落後、這是何等的可痛、要求此次方案不流於形式、怕的對於地方敎育行政、多少要先定下幾條改造路徑來、</p>
<p>一·地方敎育行政領袖的人選、就現狀觀察、經濟充裕文化進步地方、敎育局長較得人、但有時因人才多各成糸統、任用的方法不當、亦未必能無糾紛、因此發生人選標準和產生方法兩問題、從法規沿革上講、民十二敎育局規程上的局長資格、已顯然提高、但爲一法令通用全國起見最低標準不能不降低、而影響到全部、爲今之計、中央規定分期提高的各級最低標準、由各省自定單行法規、此項資格不提高、對於不諳敎育者不加限制、地方敎育、完全無辦法、但同時待遇、應與資格職務相稱、通常小縣局長標準低待遇薄、在省行政方面、亟應糾正、在小縣正待開發、需要最有能力的人才、否則便永遠落伍了、至產生方法制度不一、以由縣長保薦數人廳長圈定一人方法爲最無意義、最不負責任、亦有局長產生取比較甄用制的、然而所能比較的、不過紙面的證據、亦不可靠、較進步的、當然屬考試制、而所考得出的是知識、考不出的是人格與才能、倘若用考試做初步選擇、而又經較長期的訓練和實習、似乎較易得人、如果待遇提高、此制或可做到、經相當考察與實習後、所謂必須用本縣籍人的地方觀念、便可化除、是在省行政方面的努力</p>
<p>二·行政經費、不應出諸地方敎育經費、敎育局用費、向例在敎育經費内開支、不得不受比例的限制、局長待遇低不能得人、局員待遇低、難以羅致、行政本身事業、因經費少不能整理、地方因費用出自地方、認爲地方機關、省方除任免權外、難積極管理、行政費事業費、同一來源支配易有流弊、經費過少地方有二三十元一月的局長俸、顯太滑稽、爲避免種種困難、敎育局的行政經費、宜在省收入項下開支、行政費的預决算、纔能經按期嚴密考查、在全省每年支出增三四十萬、而敎育精神和行政管理、顯有許多帮助、即暫不能全部實行、在經費較苦的地方、非如此必無人樂於無結果的犧牲、或者省縣各分担半數、薪金和辦公費數、由省斟酌規定、亦比現制省方僅爲形式的管理要進步些、局長受省委任及待遇辦理地方事業、地方障碍誤會可减易於諒解、局長和局員的待遇、可實行提高、致力於此者乃得養家活口、减少經濟的壓迫和改業的念頭、</p>
<p>三·省方應負地方敎育經費的責任、有籌欵能力的敎育局長、容易受一般擁戴·和上級長官的信任、有敎育的抱負和知能而味於會計事務手腕的、往往不得志而去、這是何等的矛盾現象、從事敎育者、應能根本認識廢除苛捐雜稅、是解除民衆痛苦的、而一方面不得不取細大不涓的主義去雜凑經費來維持目前事業、打開各縣敎育捐稅項目、檢查一過、如果毅然嚴格廢除苛細、地方敎育或立刻完全破產、這又是何等矛盾的現象、省敎育行政當局之於地方敎育、好像讓雜牌軍隊之走食四方、就地籌欵、於是因經費的糾紛、煩雜·弊病、便把一地方的敎育精神和意義完全埋葬了、省方認爲是地方問題、不能有澈底改革計畫、紙面上的監督限制申飭禁令、至多利害關於局長個人、而紙面終究是紙面啊、敎育局長應多問敎育本身業務、少管財政或交際、這樣人才可較專門而純正、敎育本身、可稍得行政的實益、省方對於地方敎育經費、應有整個的管理糸統、絶非寄托於一二職員所能盡其責的、倘若取敎育銀行制、每地方設分行、對於存儲發放息借抵押、都取正式銀行制去辦理、大部的糾紛或弊端、可以減除、審計方面、應專設處理機關、不至使一手遮天的局長上下朦蔽、經費的開源、不應聽各地方零碎處理、至各地方負担失之不平衡、省方應指定幾種大宗捐稅·爲地方敎育專欵、各縣自由徵收的稅捐、限制宜嚴、同時應注意地方敎育資產之淸理與徵收、總之敎育局長祇能問支出的分配和限制、至於歲入的增加徵收和保管、省方應極端負責、有精密的程序計畫、專管的機關和人員、讓「敎育局長」拿充分的精神去辦「敎育」、使「敎育局」趕快脫離「敎育稅所」的時代、</p>
<p>四、地方敎育行政權的集中、封建勢力最牢固的地方、敎育局長、形同木偶、一鄕有一鄕的主人一村有一村的主人、關於計畫之變更、人員之進退、敎育局長無開口餘地、至於法令的遵守、敎學的改進、指導的報告、因爲敎育局長不是敎育管理的主人、更若秋風過耳、正如美國Ｄｉｓｌｒｉｃｔ盛行的時期、大家僅知有一學區内的校董、地方自治以一縣爲單位、不是一個三家村能各自爲政的、敎育行政權不能集中、便談不到管理、什麽視導、什麽改進、不過虚張聲勢、敎育局等於虚設、惟有遇事敷衍、在省方應授敎育局長以全權、在不背省方原則和計劃之下、應充分的保障補助、使地方敎育不至永寄生於封建勢力之下而無出頭之日、固然地方敎育、應和社會合作、不要存畫地自守的見解、但是合作是合作、干涉是干涉、在訓政時期、要希望任用優秀局長、去整理地方敎育、應將全部事業完全付托、纔可着手、爲求地方早完成自治程度起見、省行政當局應先决定態度、果然抱改革决心的、應從根本上設法、</p>
<p>五·師資整理問題、地方師資的紊亂、是無待證明的、但是紊亂的責任、應該由過去的敎育行政當局負責、他們推廣敎育和敎師需要的數量不相稱、他們没有精密的擇師標準和手續、他們没有權力干涉地主性的校長、任用不合格的敎師他們没有培養新進敎師的辦法、他們無法使在職敎師進修而不落伍、他們終於有意無意間、一年復一年、使不合校敎師充滿了敎育界、這不是敎師的錯誤、不合格者此處不留人别有留人處、不一定必作敎師、即使願當敎師、如限制較嚴、亦可事前多作準備、不合格者旣任用了、又從而取檢定等色厲内荏的手段、勉强自圓其說、這是我們稍參與敎育行政工作的人、都値得内愧於心的、目前的整理、治本方面、希望敎育界對於師資訓練問題鄭重的注意、而不涉偏見、治標方面、因各省人才分量關係、應分期規定小學敎師各級標準、合於最低標準的、在服務有效年期内努力於事實上的證明準備提高等第、全省規定若干年後、共同達到的標準、從規定日起、各地方不得任用規定標準以下的敎師、當然師資整理、比任何問題爲複雜、省敎育行政的組織中、應有專管敎師問題的部分、立定幾年的整理辦法、嚴密的執行、敎育局長得到這樣、補助、比較的敢貫澈主張、</p>
<p>以上幾點、關心地方敎育的同志們、都可感覺到的、當然解决的辦法、不一定主張相同、希望有經騐的敎育行政當局、能多注意這種問題、並研究解决的方式、</p>

<p>（四）服裝的進化、並不是完全偶然的、在應用方面須要適合國情、方能成立、方能持久、西裝是適宜於西洋人的環境設備、在中國的環境冬天嫌牠太薄、夏天嫌牠太厚、這是一般穿西服的人所常常抱怨的、所以西服是不宜於中國的環境</p>
<p>（五）中裝十分簡便、欲使美觀亦較容易、西服必須講究的材料、好的工手、並且時時用心去收拾、方能入目、若是置備一兩身西服、年頭穿到年底、油光滿身、縐紋層疊、比不講究的中裝尤覺不雅觀、</p>
<p>（六）中裝較爲便利、穿時並不費事、</p>
<p>（七）中裝較爲舒服、祇看有許多穿西服的人、回到家裏的時候、往往更換中裝、即其明證、</p>
<p>（二）辦法</p>
<p>（一）由敎育部通令全國大中小學校、嚴格採用本國材料、製本國服裝、並令已有之西服、以穿完爲度、勿再另製、</p>
<p>全國童子軍大露營（中華攝）</p>
<p>（二）由敎育部令各校校長及訓育主任、任督察勉勵之責、並令同事同學中互相勸勉、以實踐此項部令、</p>
<p>（三）由地方敎育行政機關、派員調查大中小學校、對於此項通令努力實踐的程度、並加以嘉許及表揚以示獎勵、</p>
<p>（四）令學校負社會宣傳的責任、</p>
<p>（五）各級敎育行政機關的職員、應以身作則、</p>
<p>（附註一）本國服裝爲長衣及短衣的統稱</p>
<p>（附註二）用國貨製本國服裝、並不是一律穿制服的意思</p>
<p>（附註三）本國服裝如有不便利、或不合衛生及美的原則、仍可充分的改良、不過不宜模仿任何一國的服裝、</p>
<p>▲學校中的校旗語徽章校</p>
<p>歌口號等應一律用本國</p>
<p>文字案</p>
<p>（一）理由</p>
<p>（一）獨立的國家、有他自己的語言文字以表情達意、觀現今的學校、（尤其是大學）往往以西文爲時尙、所用標語·校旗·徽章、以至於運動帽運動衣上的標語、有時竟純粹用西文、甚至閉會時所唱的校歌、運動時所喊的口號、有時也用英語、這種純粹的西洋化、實堪痛心、吾人常痛恨東西洋文化的侵略、這一類的行動、那裏是人家來侵略、簡直是自己誠意的去全副接受、唾棄本國的文字、而去用别人的文字、不但是喪失國體、還要遭外人的恥笑</p>
<p>（二）辦法</p>
<p>由敎育部通令各省敎育廳、調查各學校如有用西文的標語校旗校徽校歌口號等等、應令其一律改用本國文字　（未完）</p>

<p>▲從出入口貿易觀察吾國之國民經濟昨日下午三時、上海靑年會、舉行第七次學術講演、由壽毅成博士主講、茲將其演詞槪要錄左、</p>
<p>我國國民經濟、宜有兩種淸算、一爲國内淸算、一爲國際淸算、就國内淸算言、則（一）生寡、（二）食衆、（三）爲舒、（四）用疾、實爲我國現時經濟界最普遍之現象、易詞言之、即生產方面、無一業不落後、消費方面、無一事不向前、淸算結果、終歸負而非正、絀而非盈、是已、若就國際貿易上之淸算言之、則自同治三年、（即一八六四年）迄今、已歷六十有六年、其中除一八六四·一八七二·一八七三·一八七四·一八七五·一八七八等六年出口超過入口外、其餘六十年間、無一年非入口超過出口、此其病態一也、國外市塲、日蹙萬里、洋商勢力、瀰漫腹地、此其病態二也、出口商家、旣乏充分資本、又無健全組織、此其病態三也、發展國際貿易、端賴國際金融上之敏活、我國旣無出口貿易信用保證制度之獎勵、而國際匯兌事業、又多操於外國銀行之手、此其病態四也、海洋運輸事業之發達與否、與國外貿易之擴充、關係至爲密切、而我國則國外運輸、與夫海上保險等事業、非早經夭折、即尙未萌芽、此其病態五也、保護貿易政策、爲獎勵本國幼稚工業之必要手叚、而我國則厘金雜稅、所在多有、出口惡稅、手美國憲法上所明文禁止者、在我國則視爲重要之財源、經濟自殺、莫可爲諱、此其病態六也、信義通商、我國舊例、乃晚近以來、出口商人、祇圖目前一時之利益、不顧各業對外之信用、攙假作僞、無所不至、遂致以信用素著之中國商人、在國際貿易上、竟一變而成爲信用墜落之不良分子、道德破產、伊於胡底、此其病態七也、各國國際貿易、莫不力避被動貿易與間接貿易之弊害、而以企圖自動貿易與直接貿易之實現、爲共同一致之目標、我國則被動又被動、間接復間接、故名爲對外貿易、實則爲對洋行貿易、或爲對買辦貿易、壓迫侵略、剥削詐欺等惡劣行爲、所在多有、而受害最烈者、即爲出口商人、或與出口貿易有切膚關係之農工各界、目光短淺、智識幼稚、禍國禍羣、莫由自拔、此其病態八也、凡此怕舉、皆我國出口貿易不能充分發展之重要原因、惟國際貿易之科學的研究、首貴根據事實、則姑就六十年來、出入口貿易發展之過去與現在、爲之比較分析、以期適應趨勢、勉圖</p>
<p>我國國際貿易之現况及其趨勢、大要可分爲左列數、端討論之（一）就貿易價値之總額上觀察、我國國際貿易總額、在民國元年、爲八萬萬四千三百萬海關兩、在十八年、則爲二十四萬萬二千三百萬兩、增如在三倍之譜、此不能不認爲有相當之進步者一也、（二）就貿易入超之數額上觀察、海禁旣開、貿易入超、早成通例、民國成立以還、入超數額、尤逐年增加、自民元至十八年止、無一年非入超、惟歐戰時期、略見减少、民國八年、入超數額、落至一千六百萬兩、已爲最近四十年來不可多得之好現象、可慨何如、此不能不認爲國民經濟上不健全狀態之一端也、（三）就重要出口商品之消長上觀察、我國重要出口商品、在國際貿易上之地位、若就縱的歷史方面觀察、初爲茶、繼爲生絲、最近爲豆類、自一八六四年有關册可據以來、大要可列表如次、以十年爲一期、討分六期、而以最近數年之出口貨地位殿其後云、</p>

<p>觀於右表、可知出口貿易上各項發展之可能、惟大豆生產之增進、實多由日本經營東省所致、故得之不足深喜、而素負世界盛譽茶絲兩大宗出口商品、乃竟爲錫蘭茶日本絲所壓倒、則眞經濟國恥之莫可諱言者也、（四）就重要商品之需給上觀察、棉布輸入、歷年來均佔入口貿易之第一位、次之則或爲糖、或爲米、或爲毛絨、或爲棉紗、米之入口、逐年增多、不啻爲吾國食糧不足、農業衰落之有力證據、亦足見民食問題之亟待解决、至棉紗輸入之量漸見减少、則因改爲細紗輸入者有之、因外商在華經營紗廠事業之發達者亦有之、惟本國紗業發展、亦自爲其重要原因之一耳、更就民國十七年之入口貿易統計觀之、則輸入價値、（甲）在一萬萬兩以上爲棉貨、（乙）在九千萬兩者爲糖、（此爲歷年來之最高數、實我國入口貿易史上之新紀錄、）（丙）在六千萬兩以上者爲棉花、五金鑛物及煤油、（丁）在四千萬兩以上者、爲毛製品、（戊）在三千萬兩以上者爲燭菸草麫粉及化學產品、（己）在二千萬兩以上者爲糧類紙類絲物魚介海產捲菸蔴貨煤、（庚）在一千萬兩以上者爲機器木料葷食品棉紗染料人造靛及皮類、此皆我國所能產、或爲國產所能代、徒以内亂頻仍、百業破產、技術拙劣、勝算難操、遂致以貨替代國貨者、所在而有、而以國貨替代外貨者、則寥若百星、國中經濟各界、果能於「替代外貨」一端、努力從事、則提倡國貨、庶有實際可言、而國際貿易之化逆差爲順差、固亦意中事耳、（五）就產種工業產品之出口貿易觀察、吾國對外貿易、歷年以來、出口爲原料、入口爲洋貨、幾成定例、工業產品之出口、可謂極少、唯近年以來、機製洋貨之出口、增加甚多、似亦爲國内製造業進步之一部的證據、當民國十四年間、機製洋貨出口總値、爲二百二十七萬四千八百餘兩、十五年爲二千六百六十五萬六千餘兩、十七年爲三千九百五十七萬兩、增加十倍左右、此種倣洋式機製貨物輸出之增加、即可證明我國出品、已漸在海外市塲、佔有最低限度之勢力、亦可知此項工業、已有漸臻發展之趨勢、惟此項出口貨物、間有運往香港、再由香港復入中國者、亦有洋商在中國所設廠製造者、則吾人自亦不能不注意及之耳、（六）就特種工業用品之入口貿易上之觀察、吾國工業用品中之機器、素仰給於外洋、故每年機器入口之數、即可謂吾國工業進步之一部份寒署表、考民國二睥時、機器進口、所値不過四百六十五萬餘兩、八年即增至一千四百萬兩、十年最高數爲五千五百餘萬兩、最近亦尙有一千九百餘萬兩、凡此情形、均可爲推測吾國工業盛衰之標準、惟外人在華設廠者甚多、機器由外人工廠購用者、自必亦佔其中之重要部份、故尙未可僅據此以爲吾國工業進步之唯一標準也、（七）從無形輸出之來源上觀察、貿易逆差、並非槪括的不利於一國之經濟、即以英國爲例、幾無一年非入超、如一九二六年爲四萬七千萬鎊、一九二九年爲三萬六千六百萬鎊、而英國國富不以是見損、誠以英國之無形輸出、爲額極鉅、如船舶水脚、國外投資利息佣金、及保險費等、皆其著者、我國每年入超、而每年均有鉅額之生銀輸入、最近兩年來、爲數且均在一萬萬兩以上、推厥原因、則華僑之匯欵祖國、實爲其居重路之來源、彼以殖資富其國、我以殖力療吾貧、勞逸雖殊、工拙雖異、而其爲適應環境之原則所支配則一也、各國對華投資、爲額亦鉅、自亦宜留意及之、以此等未見關册之輸入、均與我國各項有形的出口貿易、互爲因果、關係至切也、（八）從有形輸入之去路上觀察、前淸道光初年、出入口貿易、均集中於廣東、道咸之交、漸推及於上海漢口等長江一帶之通商口岸、一八九三年後、則天津牛莊漸見重要、一九零三年後、則膠州大連、漸露頭角、而哈爾濱在陸上國際貿易之市場、亦益於重要、形勢推移、類皆以新式交通機關如路航等事業之發展、爲其樞紐、交通便利一分、則生產事業進步一分、生產事業進步一分、則人民之購買力增進一分、人民之購買力增進一分、亦即有形輸入之去路拓展一分、事勢有然、難以力抗、所當反復加之意者、則輸入與否、當視我之需要與否而定、或捨或取、權自我操、又曷可任令洋貨壓倒土貨、致大好市塲、轉爲他國工業界作尾閭耶、（九）就各國國際貿易總額之地位上觀察、吾人可更從全世界國際貿易上一觀察中國之地位、然歐戰以前（一九一二）英國確居第一位、德國居第二位、美國居第三位、大戰以後、此種情形、根本變遷、美國已躍居全民界貿易之第一位、英國退居第二位、次之爲德國法國坎拿大印度日本意大利阿根廷比利時諸國、至於中國、在全世界貿易塲所占之數目、在戰前占第十二位、戰後在一九二七年略高、占第九位、惟吾人所應注意者、全民界之貿易、戰後較戰前增加極多、一九二七年與一九一三年比較、爲三七·七九七兆金圓與二六·八００兆金圓之比、即一九二七年幾增高百分之七十、在此種全世界貿易急劇增高情勢之下、則吾國國際貿易之隨以俱進、固勢所必至、惟尙嫌其進步之至遲至緩耳、（十）就各國人口比例之每人平均貿易額上觀察、自國際貿易實際數字觀</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>察、中國常居全民界之第十二位、若自人口比例上觀察、則中國實無一年不居全世界之末位、據國際聯盟統計所載、全世界平均每人貿易額之最大者爲亞丁、每人合八百金元以上、次之爲英屬馬來羣島、紐西蘭·坎拿大·澳洲·荷蘭·瑞士·紐芬蘭等、每人平均均在二百元上、英國平均每人貿易額爲一八八·八八金元、比利時爲一七一·八八金元、法國合九二·五八金元、德國合七四·六一金元、美國合七六·一三金元、日本合三三·二七金元、而中國之平均每人貿易額、則僅二·九六金元、爲各國中之最少者、我國固可以人口繁庶自豪、然以人口比例貿易、得毋相形見絀之過甚乎、</p>
<p>觀於以上所述、可知我國國際貿易、欲謀充分發展、其致力之途徑、大要凡本、一曰保護貿易政策之勵行、大戰以後、歐美各國政府、皆以獎勵出口貿易爲恢復經濟實力之惟一政策、故於基本工業之保護與獎勵、不遺餘力、我國政府、對於厘金雜稅之廢止、早已三令五申、期在必行、而於出口稅之减免、特種製造品進口稅之酌加、與夫新興工業之保護出口貿易之獎勵政策、亦已早爲當局計劃之所及、此就政府言、所當努力從事者一也、如各國之經營國際貿易者、類皆資本雄厚、組織健全、我國經濟幼稚、一時誠未易學步、惟爲競勝國際商塲計、則從事國際貿易者、要非第一流之企業家不辦、而組織健全、尤爲對外貿易成功上之必要條件、此就出口商家之自身言、所努力從事者二也、國際貿易之輔助機關、有由政府設立者、亦有私人設立者、而其爲發展對外貿易所必需、則固一般所公認、我國於國際匯兌銀行、出口商品檢騐機關、工商訪問機關、以及駐餐商務專員之設置、現已具有端倪、而國際貿易研究委員會、全國出口貿易恊會等輔助機關之組織、與夫國際運輸便利之增進等問題之解决、則尙有待於最近之將來、此就輔助機關言、所當努力進行者、此其三也、我國靑年、若能　明出口貿易發展問題、爲我國經濟界之生死存亡問題、而於國際商業之科學的研究、與夫發展對外貿易運動之心理的建設、能有所貢獻、則國民經濟前途之幸也、云云、</p>

<p>▲已往的工作　本局自十六年冬、開始舉辦勞工統計、目的在藉統計的探討、來觀察和圖謀解决市内的勞工問題、草創的時候、凡百都在計劃之中、十七年一月起、先行試辦工資指數罷工統計和勞資糾紛統計三種、以應行政上參考的急需、十八年春出版「上海特别市工資指數之試編」、「上海特别市罷工統計報告」、和「上海特别市勞資糾紛統計報告」三書、由上海福州路大東書局發行、每種統計辦理的經過和結果、都詳載專册、這裏毋須再講、同時更從事編譯勞工統計叢書、介紹勞工統計知識、希望各地能夠次第舉辦、已出版和在印刷中的書目如下、生活費指數編製法（上海商務印書館發行）失業統計法（同上）工業勞資糾紛統計編輯法（同上）工人意外遭遇統計法（印刷中）美國住宅問題槪觀（同上）家常生計調查法（同上）勞動恊約統計法（同上）十七年下半年、添聘統計人員、計劃辦理上海工人生活程度調查、生活費指數、零售物價調查、和失業統計等項、其中失業統計爲試騐調查性質、自九月舉辦、費三個月始得調查完竣、結果已在本局社會月刋第八期中發表、該刋亦由上海大東書局發行、十八年度、繼續辦理工資、罷工停業、勞資糾紛等統計、並開始工人家庭生活費調查和零售物調查、生活費調查、採標準取樣法、選查工人家庭四百家、期限一年、派員每日前往各家代替或指導記賬、每人管理二十家左右、每月嚴密審查、隨時計算、至十九年三月、調查部分、可以完全結朿、以後不過是計算和編製的工作了、零售物價調查、自十八年一月起、由局派員負責調查、除葷素菜市價、每週調查一次、米糧每月調查三次、其餘的物品、都是每月調查一次、調查的貨品、不厭求詳、大都根所有生活費調查所得的結果、而爲工人日常所消費的、市内被調查的商號、除各小菜塲外、計百五十多家、這種零售商舖的主顧、大部分是工人、十七年秋、因爲我們已經充分得到上面各種零售商舖的信仰和諒解、所以又計劃追查一九二六年到現在的零售物價、進行以來、成績尙稱滿意、不久也可結朿、結果將來和生活費指數同時發表、又我們在十七年開始舉辦的工資調查、是工人實入額、每月調查一次、先依工業分、再依男女童工人分、我們爲明瞭各業詳細的工資率情形起見、在十八年六月起、計劃工資率調查、十一月調查蕆事、編製方法、先依工業分、再以職務及男女童工人分、現在正在分職和計算之中、希望能在十九年五月編竣發表、（未完）</p>

<p>— 妍千</p>
<p>數日前客有自上海來者。謂於舟中遇雹。並告余以雹之形狀曰。體積有殊。約分三式。大者若鷄卵。其次若胡桃。最小若蓮子。間有半劈者。似萊菔之底片。其上迴旋文甚顯。各五六七迴不等。有兩三迴爲透明體。居中則有一圓心。而大小之中。又有異點。或其圓整。或極不圓整。若疵累然。疑係數雹合併而成是狀者。因客此言。遂引起同座人之爭辯。余以空論無益。不如翻書。迺共尋得以下各條</p>
<p>辭源。「雹。雨冰也。雷雨時雲氣爲電衝激。入高空冰雪線界。凝爲冰點雪片。又旋轉團結而成冰塊。與雨雜下也。」據此說。則客所言信有徵矣。五六七迴不等之迴旋文也。兩本迴爲透明體也。豈非足以證明冰點雪片旋轉團結之說爲科學的乎。而數雹合併而成一說。亦有幾分相像歟</p>
<p>大戴禮註曰。「陽氣在雨。温煖如陽。陰氣薄之不相入。搏而爲雹。故春秋穀梁傳曰。雹者。陰脅陽之象也。」埤雅曰。「陰包陽爲雹。」禮月令註曰。「陽如雨。陰起脅之。凝爲雹。劉向曰。「盛陽。雨水温煖而湯熱。陰氣脅之不相入。則轉而爲雹。故沸湯之在閉器。而湛之於甘泉。則爲冰。此其騐也。以上四說。與前一說義實同。不過古今用字用辭大有不同耳。</p>
<p>但左傳中却有一玄虚說頭曰。聖人在上無雹。雖有。不爲災。好在盲先生在說雹之由來。並非講雹之成因。似無妨於前幾說之舉今說爭一席地也。吾人只當彼瞎說可也。</p>
<p>此外。又有别名不可不知。而别名下所貫串之故事尤不可不曉也。韵會補曰。洮岷間雨雹曰白雨。又曰硬頭雨。宋紹興十七年。臨安雨雹。太學屋瓦皆碎。學宮諱言雹。遂曰硬雨。此硬雨便大可研究。大約總是信仰瞎說之故。不爲學宮係至聖先師靈光所照而避忌。即爲怕主張和議。誣殺岳飛。向金納貢稱臣之宰相秦檜無疑。</p>
<p>至劉向沸湯　在閉器　而湛之于甘泉。則爲氷之實騐。頗與現在之製氷結淋有髣髴處。或則彼時中國早已發明氷結淋乎。一笑。</p>

<p>▲文天祥字　泰興民風醇樸。故人民彬彬有禮。而城内之文廟。至軒敞。構造亦精緻。莊嚴宏麗。金碧輝煌。明倫堂前之屏門四扇。係楠木制。門上雕刻一絶大之魁字。（作合錦式）丈餘見方。筆致遒勁。娟秀異常。係文天祥所書。相傳文山繕至鬼字勾時。腕力漸不濟。提左足一踢。右腕藉足力。迺順勢而上。故鬼字句。愈覺有勁。迄雖千數百年。尙完好未損。眞墨寳也。</p>

<p>▲荀慧生片　倒板下迴龍本有啊字長腔。此片大槪因篇幅關係而截去。嚇得奴戰兢兢一句。唱原板。末一兢字。其工譜爲六六尺三字組成。六字在板上。尺字在眼上。此三字看去似屬平常。但在琴絃上至爲動聽。娘娘有話來問你一句。其譜四上凡尺上工尺上五仩五六凡六五仩六曼聲低唱。聞之心醉矣。</p>
<p>▲蔣君稼片　君稼所灌二片。詞句首尾完備。啊字腔亦有。惟亦爲快三眼。戲高裴二折。與慧生所唱微有出入。慧生以柔媚甜潤勝。此則以淸勁流利勝。各有優點也。去也尾聲中之冷淸淸三字。高而不竭。尤見功夫處。聽罷誌此。彷彿猶有餘味。留於齒頰間焉。</p>

<p>當淸季楊了公爲寳山廣文時。與家君誼屬師生。但脫略形迹。其就任也。不携役使。有詩友沈聾汪痴。追隨學署。本屬冷衙。與家君時相過從。同僚或邑人士。招讌輒謝絶。每日。至城西校閒遊。適遇午膳時。欲留膳。公謂無須肴饌。只需雞子十枚。白糖半斤開水一盂。龍井一壺足矣。家君至學署。則欵以紅燒牛肉一罐。麫衣十張。汶酒半斤。家君董西校事。於校之西隅。闢一室。顏曰渠軒。請公書。公題額後。并爲之記。記曰。王子構室於城西校之西額。以渠軒屬題。或曰。是非渠之軒也。奚以爲渠軒。余謂天下萬事萬物。何者是渠有。何者非渠有。必斤斤於渠有非渠有之間。何隘也。且是室之西。夏有荷渠。秋有芙渠。何一不可以軒渠。渠軒於渠何有。渠軒於渠何人。語竟。或爲之軒渠。余遂以軒渠。楊了公書。是記懸諸室中。保存多年。記者在校肄業時。猶見及。且能憶及。不圖目令長校非人。桌几一毀殆盡。是額亦不知流落何處。每一回里。目擊心傷。迴溯楊公。爲之惘然。</p>

<p>梁君性到奇特。與常人殊。蓋彼自有生以來。不能嘗葷。嗅其味則嘔吐隨作。鹹酸苦辣甜。舍首尾二味外。餘皆不能入口。有異味者不食。韮菜葱蒜俱不食。日惟以靑菜荳腐助餐。而飯量乃不弱。故是夕也。主人特治素菜以饗之。</p>
<p>抑尤有甚者。梁君不吸烟。不飲酒。食色之所謂性。而梁君不好焉。其言曰。余旣得而研討生理之學矣。人身之構造。罔論性别。俱已了然於余懷。不過皮包骨耳。何堪致意。何先生遂諄諄言曰。口腹之供。素食已超百種。煎炒燉煑。何味不能敵葷。人身不過一臭皮囊耳。食雖甘旨。而所溺則一。余儕又何苦多殺生以供一飽乎。（何先生亦力主素食者）。又轉爲梁君言曰。君之前生。當必爲一高僧。第以功行未完。罪業未凈。故彼冥冥造物主。更罰君來此多歷一番滄桑。君其自勉焉。</p>

<p>熊總領事云。此次梅君來美。於東方文化影響異常之大。於將來中美感情關係亦異常之大。正好趁此機會遊歷各城。以廣宣傳云云。</p>
<p>今日Ｈｅｒａｌｄ　Ｔｒ　ｕｎｅ報著有論文一篇。略謂梅君靑年玉貎。此次來美。成極佳。我看了也極滿意。初次開演座爲之滿。尙在意中。及演至四星期之久。座仍照舊。則可知美人對於中國劇之歡迎程度矣。中國劇組織極高。不易學。惟現有此機會看此好戲。看此完全的藝術。豈非至愉快之事耶。又云梅君不但表演之佳。人格亦極高尙云云。（三月十七日）</p>

<p>復旦劇社在去年就决定要演這個曾經在歐美劇壇轟動過一時的浪漫主義劇西哈諾、後來因爲該社主持人洪深先生病了、以致這個偉大的劇本終於没有能夠搬上中國的舞臺、這當然是我們關心劇運的同志們所引爲遺憾的、</p>
<p>一九三０年的劇壇總算是很活躍的了、藝術劇社、摩登社等等、都是其中很努力的團體、尤其是各學校的劇團、自從經摩登社的提倡學校劇運動而來、也更加蓬勃地在活動、</p>
<p>復旦劇社本來在各大學中也算是很負盛譽的、當然也在這個緊要關頭着手進行了、於是籌備西哈諾排演的聲浪、又滿佈校内了、</p>
<p>西哈諾、據我們所知道的、是需要很多的演員來扮演、裏面的男主角西哈諾、由洪深先生自己擔任、當然没有什麽問題、而女主角霍克桑、則因爲種種的問題、頗費一番躊躇、</p>
<p>本來上學期的决定、是預備叫那個曾因演了寄生草而獲得美譽的金衷愉女士擔任的、而今年因爲金女士快畢業了、要預備畢業論文、勢不能再有許多閒工夫來排演這個繁重的霍克桑、</p>
<p>記得該校的壁報上、曾經有過一個消息、說本學期曾由各處轉來了很多頗負盛名的女士、那洪深先生當然很注意了、於是經了金女士的介紹、有一位從中大轉來的郁劍碧女士、經洪先生的再三請求、便答應了來演霍克桑的角色、</p>
<p>郁女士是這個學期才到復旦來的新生、她本來是在中央大學讀政治的、後來因爲那個被一班闊官要人鬧過一陣的金陵不能留住她的芳蹝、便毅然地轉到了這所東南最高學府的復旦來、凡是看到郁女士那個健而美的體格、善於表情的姿態、以及說話時天然就含有一種Ｍｅｌａｎｃｈｏｌｙ的誘惑、誰都會立刻就知道以她來演西哈中的霍克桑是再好也没有的了、</p>
<p>但是、不幸得很、最近又聽到郁女士不預備扮這個脚色的消息了、據說是因了郁女士是新生、功課很忙、而校裏一切的事又不甚熟悉、所以不想扮這個太覺繁重的主角、不過、到底洪深先生預備呌那一位蜜司來擔任這個角色呢、聽說以前他央求郁女士充任這個角色時、還曾經費了很多的氣力呢、</p>
<p>所以、西哈諾是預備上演了、但女主角的問題却還没有决定呢、</p>
<h3 id="c181">南洋華僑的婦女生活　·Ｙ·Ｓ <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>我自幼在英屬南洋流浪、因此對於南洋的風土人情以及日常生活等等、頗知梗槪、現且把南洋華僑的婦妇生活、先行給國人介紹一二、</p>
<p>「地位與職業」、任誰到過南洋的、也不能不相信南洋華僑是富於保守性的、二三百年來、華僑之處在荒蠻的生番之國土裏生活着、而不致被同化了、這本是很可慶幸的一回事、但這刦不能不說是他們的保守性的惠賜了、時代的潮流、雖然是一天一天地演進、而華僑的保守天性還是「依然如故、在那裏的華僑婦女、她們的腦筋裏還充滿了舊禮敎的遺毒、把「閏門女訓」的「三從四德」奉爲「金科玉律」、她們只有「嫁猪從猪、嫁狗從狗、」什麽都要仰鼻息於男人的思想、因此男子們也就樂得把她們當作玩物似的供養着、她們有着安逸的幸福生活過着、便也不管什麽地位不地位、女權不女權了、</p>
<p>年來國内的革命高潮、漸漸地影響到南洋華僑社會裏去了、於是什麽婦女解放協會的團體的產生、便時有所聞了、考其實際、仍不免爲男子輕視與侮辱而已、至於其原因、無非是經濟地位之不能獨立、英屬南洋的華僑婦女、對於技能上、智識上的已没有什麽預備、經濟地位又怎能達到獨立的地步、近年來國内的歌舞明星、自到南洋之後、便得到了當地僑胞的歡迎、風行一時、因此各校都要聘請什麽歌舞敎員了、所以現在的南洋華僑婦女之職業出路、除了少數在女校當敎員之外、多是當歌舞敎員的、至於那些受過外國敎育的「娘嬺」們（土著女子也）也不過在外國洋行裏或郵局電報局當職員而已、而有些貧苦的華僑婦女、則多數爲人傭工吧了、</p>
<p>「服裝」、南洋地近赤道、所以終年如夏、每天的温度約在攝氏表六十餘度至七十餘度、因此之故、她們的服裝便不講究而且趨向於簡單的巫（馬來人）裝方面了、何况華僑在那裏、也有不少娶巫人爲妻、生出來的土著、便不免要受到環境與習俗的影響了、普通婦女（指華僑土生女子而言）多衣巫裝、一條紅紅綠綠的富有圖案意味的圍裙｜紗郎｜圍着下體長及胸部、下至足踝、長約四尺餘、上體除「馬甲」外、尙穿着一件薄紗長衫、長幾垂至足踝、赤脚拖着金線繡成的拖鞋、髻則梳在前腦上、插着五六支金簪或銀簪、初看去眞敎人要疑作中國的古裝呢、像這樣裝束的婦女、是被華僑稱作「娘嬺」的、其實「娘嬺」是馬來話、含有「夫人」或「姑娘」之意也、如英文的Ｌａｄｙ一般意義、至於那些不是土著的婦女、則多服中國固有的裝束、近年來、爲了國產影片的影響、這般「娘嬺」們便漸漸地卸去巫裝、換上上海式的時裝了、</p>
<p>「習慣與言語」、爲了同異族相處日久的原故、不無受到一些同化的、英屬南洋的華僑婦女、便是像中了深毒的人似的、她們嗜好檳榔、把檳榔和石灰「甘蜜」以筠葉包裸好、送入口裏、仔細咀嚼着、而所吐出來的却是一種血也似的液體、呼出來的、是一種難聞的酸味、嗜好深的、幾乎時時不能離口、因此一副潔白的牙齒、便不便要變成和吸鴉片的人的牙齒一般黑得難看了、</p>
<p>吃飯的時候、多以手代筷、盛飯器具、則多用盤碟、因爲這樣她們才能感到方便呢、</p>
<p>至於她們所說的言語是很複雜的但起碼會說三種語言的是很普通的事、有的竟會說五六種語言呢、如馬來話、英語·客音·福建話·廣東語等、而馬來話和福建話幾乎是她們日常所習用的言語了、中國的國語、如果不是曾受過中國敎育的、那眞可說是鳳毛麟角了、</p>
<p>以上所談的、不過是英屬南洋華僑的婦女生活大槪情形的一斑而已、掛一漏萬、是在所在不免的一回事、但我很希望讀者諸君能留心出她們的生活、對於我們華僑的前途有没有利害來、</p>

<p>近代歐洲各國的人、對於中國都發生了有趣味的研究、所以只要一寫到中國的故事、他便可以成名、尤其住在中國的西洋女子、她們對於詩歌·文學·遺聞軼事等、比較資本化的男女容易有閑心的寫作、在過去黑克女士的杜甫傳及其作品、和塞西女士的中國文學研究一卷都在英美亨得了盛名、最近在倫敦刋行一部何巴特（Ａｌｉｃｅ　Ｔｉｓｉｄｅ　Ｈｏｂａｒｔ）女士的關於中國商人羅曼的歷史的描寫、使西洋人對於中國發生了興趣、這部稿子名呌商業的貨車、（Ｐｉｄｇｉｎ　Ｃａｒｇｏｎ）是關於中國一個絲商領袖的羅曼的描寫、在許多記載中却含着諷剌的成分、她的丈夫是一個在中國居留的美國商人、因此她用了十五年的工夫來耐心的描寫、兩年前南京革命與孫傳芳激戰的時候、不幸的、使她十五年前的心血失落了、然而他的中國僕役在過去的十五年間、看見女主人用心的寫作、一定是很有價値的東西、所以拚命的爲她把稿子搶出來、現在因着經過這樣的一個難關、在倫敦初版時、更惹起人們的狂熱的注意了、（昌溪）</p>

<p>Russian Consulate in Harbin Notifies Commissioner Zhong</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Russian consulate in Harbin notified Commissioner Zhong by telephone at noon on the 19th that it had received a telegram from the Moscow government stating that the notification regarding the Chinese representative's visit to Russia for the meeting had been received, and preparations for the reception were underway. A formal reply was delayed due to the Russian holiday, but would be delivered within the next week. The central government had not yet allocated funds for Mo Teh-hui's trip to Russia, so the Northeast would advance the funds first. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Directorate-General of the Chinese Eastern Railway has established a preparatory office for the Sino-Russian conference. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Mo Teh-hui issued travel allowance to his staff members on the 19th. After Mo leaves the country, a Sino-Russian conference office will be established in Harbin.</p>
<p>(19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Russian consulate in Harbin delivered a formal reply from the Russian government regarding the Sino-Russian conference at the Foreign Affairs Office at 2 PM on the 20th, stating roughly, "The notification of your country's representative, Mr. Mo, arriving via Harbin on the 12th to convene the Sino-Russian conference has been received. We hope Mr. Mo will arrive before May 1st to convene the meeting based on the Khabarovsk conference and not delay it further." Other matters were not mentioned. After the notification was delivered, Russian Consul Mei spoke with Zhong Yu by telephone, saying that due to the urgency of the May 1st date, the notification was issued early to allow Mr. Mo to prepare for his journey. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Mo Teh-hui telegraphed Beijing, requesting the prompt allocation of travel expenses. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Northwest Generals Urge Yan to Issue Pay</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Taiyuan states that Feng plans to leave Tongguan for Zhengzhou on the 25th. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying arrived in Bian on the 19th and met with Wan Xuancai. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Beiping on the 19th states that Lu Zhonglin convened a meeting of Pang Bingxun, Ji Hongchang, and other officers above the rank of colonel in Luoyang, urging Yan to quickly issue 3 million in pay and 1 million rounds of ammunition. If there is any further delay, they are unwilling to serve on the front lines. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Jin News: (1) Zheng News: Feng instructed Lu Zhonglin with a secret plan to secretly send many assassins to plot against Wan. Zheng and Bian have been conducting very strict searches recently. If anything happens to either side, they will send representatives to negotiate with each other. According to those familiar with the details, Lu and Wan harbor deep resentment towards each other, and both sides are on high alert, with a situation that could erupt at any moment. (2) Feng plans to go to Zhengzhou immediately to allocate a large sum of money and wants to use the excuse of inspection to remove Wan Xuancai. Wan Xuancai, the chairman of Henan Province, was gradually deceived by Yan before and is now being eliminated by Feng. If something happens, the entire situation will be sacrificed immediately. He deeply regrets taking the path of ruin and has changed his attitude, showing signs of surrender. However, due to his current position, he has to pretend to cooperate with Yan and Feng. His subordinates also know that Wan has this hidden intention and are only using him temporarily. Once they find a suitable opportunity, they will stage a rebellion and offer their loyalty. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang left Tongguan on the 16th and will arrive in Zhengzhou in a few days to command all troops. Xu Yongchang and Yang Aiyuan left Shijiazhuang on the 18th for Zhengzhou. Xu and Yang are representatives of the Shanxi army and will remain with Feng Yuxiang for joint operations, so they will likely stay in Zhengzhou. (19th Rengo Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Reports received here today state that Qi Xieyuan has been appointed by Yan and Feng as the commander-in-chief of the front line in the Longhai Railway area, and Sun Dianying's army is under Qi's command. Qi himself has arrived in Haozhou.

<h3 id="e21">Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>In the past, the diplomatic tactics of powerful nations were forceful; today, the diplomatic tactics of powerful nations are flexible. In the past, so-called economic aggression, while focusing on commercial competition, also required military force as an auxiliary. Today's economic aggression focuses exclusively on the outward development of commerce and precedes it with cordial friendship. This is due to the realization of the necessity of turning to peace after the European war, and is also driven by the current trend of commercial stagnation. This treaty of friendship and trade is therefore one of the world's most pressing needs. Taking Europe as an example, countries that were once closely related, such as Germany and Austria, have recently signed treaties of friendship and trade. Even countries that were formerly hostile, such as Italy and Austria, have now abandoned their previous animosity and established treaties of friendship and trade. Similarly, the United Kingdom and Russia, after breaking off diplomatic relations, have long discussed resuming them without success. Recently, they have suddenly realized the formal resumption of diplomatic relations, and now they have taken a further step and signed a temporary trade agreement. It can be seen that today's global trend is to abandon old grudges and forge new relationships. However, the sincerity of friendship between the two countries and the duration of that friendship cannot be predicted at present. It must wait until the tangible benefits and harms obtained after trade begin to determine it.</p>
<p>The success of the formal resumption of diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Russia was due to the efforts of the British Labour government. The Conservative Party still has opponents to this day. However, at that time, the British Labour government advocated resolving all outstanding issues before resuming diplomatic relations, while Russia demanded resuming diplomatic relations first and then discussing outstanding issues. As a result, negotiations temporarily stalled. Later, the British government agreed to resume diplomatic relations first, and the agreement was concluded. Therefore, except for the prohibition of propaganda, which was resolved first, all other issues, such as commerce, debt, and fisheries, are stipulated to be resolved gradually after the resumption of diplomatic relations. The signing of the temporary trade agreement today is being carried out in accordance with the resumption of diplomatic relations agreement. However, there are still many other contentious issues. Whether everything can proceed smoothly without obstacles cannot be predicted today. Moreover, the United Kingdom and Russia are eager to resume diplomatic relations because they are under pressure from commercial decline and economic difficulties. However, the economic organizations, doctrines, and policies of the two countries are fundamentally different. To what extent can they be friendly? This must be proven by future facts. Using the United Kingdom and Russia as evidence, it can be seen that today's flourishing treaties of friendship and trade are nothing more than a temporary alliance aimed at resolving each other's difficulties.</p>

<p>Government Declares Effective Suppression of Disorder</p>
<p>Muslims Show Pro-British Tendencies</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Simla, 19th: When the news of the Chittagong rebellion reached Simla, the Legislative Assembly was holding a meeting of the Road Development Committee. Sir Mitra, the chairman of the meeting, immediately went to the Governor-General's Office to participate in the executive meeting considering the situation in Bengal and other places. Although the Chittagong rebellion is quite serious, it is limited to one corner. The government is confident that it can quell the disorder and round up the rebels. The executive meeting is currently studying methods of military alert and security. The overall situation is now under control. Rioters may take advantage of the disturbances caused by the Gandhi movement to continue their attacks, but the government has preparations to deal with it and does not worry about the spread of the disorder. Chittagong has long been a center of anarchist activity.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Simla, 19th: Indian Governor Irwin today promulgated the Bengal Ordinance to Suppress Riots. This ordinance was promulgated in Bengal during the reign of Lord Minto as Governor-General of India, based on the Act of 1818. Any undesirable elements that the government deems to be such may be deported. Special laws such as the Explosives Act, the Prohibition of Seditious Assemblies Act, and the Criminal Law Amendment Act were also passed that year. The aforementioned ordinances are currently only applicable to Bengal. If the situation stabilizes, they can be revoked on April 23.</p>

<p>Denounce Unfair Treatment by the British</p>
<p>Demand Merger with Their Motherland, Greece</p>
<p>▲London News: Cyprus, an island in the Mediterranean, came under British administration after the Russo-Turkish War in 1878. Recently, Greek members of the island's parliament, dissatisfied with the unfair treatment by the British, have made demands to the British government, requesting that the island be merged with its mother country, Greece, or that the islanders be granted autonomy. Greeks make up the majority of the island's population. Their reasons for anti-British sentiment are: (1) The existing constitutional government is only nominal; (2) Agriculture is underdeveloped; (3) The island has no seaports; (4) Primary education is nominal and not real; (5) Forests have been destroyed and not replanted; (6) Tax laws are harsh, extracting huge sums of money from the people every year, ostensibly as contributions to the Ottoman Empire, while British officials receive generous salaries, which is extremely unfair.

<p>Negotiations Break Down for Tokyo Municipal Streetcar Workers</p>
<p>Textile Mill Dispute Escalates Dangerously</p>
<p>Metropolitan Police Department on High Alert</p>
<p>▲Tokyo Dispatch, 20th, Japan Associated Press - After Tokyo Electric Bureau Chief Mr. Kakei demanded a final decision from the workers' demands, he waited in his office last night for a response from the negotiating team. Exceeding the scheduled time by one hour, Mr. Kumamoto of the Tokyo Transportation Labor Union finally informed him by phone of their refusal to answer. As a result, labor-management negotiations have completely broken down. Prior to this, the union's central leadership had agreed to initiate a strike starting on the morning of the 20th. At 3:50 PM, an emergency directive was issued to all branches. Before dawn on the 20th, except for a portion of the Otsuka, Sugamo, and Shinmeicho depots, a general strike was implemented. Simultaneously, municipal public buses were completely controlled, suspending operations on all lines. The Electric Bureau had prepared in advance, immediately requesting assistance from municipal staff, reservists, and youth groups on the 20th to operate a portion of the streetcars. At the same time, they recruited temporary drivers and ticket sellers, preparing for a protracted struggle.</p>
<p>▲Osaka Dispatch, 20th, Dentsu News Agency - Seeing that they could not alienate the workers of the Kanebo Hyogo Textile Mill who are on a general strike, the company resorted to oppressive measures yesterday afternoon, dismissing eleven strike leaders. This action only exacerbated the workers' emotions, and not a single worker reported to work. The atmosphere of unrest is becoming increasingly tense, and there is currently no sign of resolution.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>▲Tokyo Dispatch, 20th, Japan Associated Press - The Metropolitan Police Department and the Security Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs are taking the matter very seriously due to reports of ideological groups operating behind the streetcar strike and that these groups have close ties with other major cities. In particular, workers' unions related to the Electric Power Industry, which are taking a common struggle with the municipal streetcar workers' Transportation Labor Union, and workers' unions related to the Tokyo Municipal Insurance Bureau and Civil Engineering Bureau are also discussing certain issues. Upon hearing of the start of the strike, the Metropolitan Police Department immediately telegraphed police departments in various prefectures, entrusting them with vigilance. Also, at 10:00 AM, in order to cut off communication between the striking group and other transportation unions and to prevent the raising of dispute funds, they sent special telegrams to the police departments of important cities such as Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe, ordering crackdowns.</p>
<p>▲Tokyo Dispatch, 20th, Dentsu News Agency - The streetcar dispute, triggered by the announcement of a 10% reduction in the June bonus, which has been ongoing since the 15th, broke down in negotiations at 10:15 AM yesterday. Streetcar and public bus workers simultaneously launched a strike this morning. The Municipal Electric Bureau had anticipated this move and immediately implemented contingency plans, urgently mobilizing 900 trainees and dispatching 250 streetcars with police officers, approximately two-tenths of the usual service. They also sought assistance from youth groups and recruited public bus drivers at a daily rate of five yen. The Transportation Labor Union headquarters, the organization for municipal streetcar workers, issued directives to each branch, urging workers not to be deceived by the employer's negative propaganda, to strengthen solidarity, and to achieve their desired goals. They also sought to prevent external incitement and agitation by taking workers to suburban banquets.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Hamaguchi Roars a Preliminary Warning</p>
<p>▲Tokyo Dispatch, 20th, Dentsu News Agency - The special Diet session is imminent. The government and the Doshikai Party met yesterday afternoon at the Tokyo Kaikan. At the meeting, Prime Minister Hamaguchi gave a speech as follows: "In this general election, I keenly felt that (1) even under the medium-sized constituency system, absolute majorities can be obtained through hard work, (2) the people recognize the confrontation between the two major political parties and are not interested in neutral assemblymen, and (3) those who arbitrarily change their party affiliation for their own convenience all end up losing the election. I am extremely satisfied to have learned these three lessons. The London Treaty will soon be signed, from which we can hope for world peace and reduce the burden on the people, which is extremely gratifying. In terms of domestic affairs, in order to thoroughly reorganize the economy, it is necessary to continue implementing austerity policies and reorganizing public bonds. There is no reason to be pessimistic about the future of the financial world. Those who attribute the current business slump to the lifting of the gold embargo are mistaken. In fact, today's slump is a global trend, not unique to Japan. Through the gold embargo, exchange rates have stabilized, restoring international economic normalcy, which will gradually lead to solid recovery. In addition to implementing industrial rationalization and export compensation systems, post-embargo measures must also include the promotion of domestic products. If excellent domestic products are used in place of foreign goods, imports can be reduced by 200 to 300 million yuan. Therefore, we plan to start a campaign to promote domestic products as soon as the budget is passed. The unemployment problem is the most difficult to solve among social problems. The fundamental solution to this problem is to revitalize industry. Within the limits of what current finances can afford, we have not neglected relief measures. Recent incidents of suspected corruption show the corruption of the political world. The biggest cause of this is excessive election expenses. To fundamentally solve this bad atmosphere, we need to broaden (something missing here)."</p>

<p>Central Propaganda Department Telegram to: National Emergency, Propaganda Departments of Provincial Party Headquarters, Propaganda Departments of Special Municipal Party Headquarters, All Armed Forces, All Railways, Special Party Headquarters of the Navy, and Forward to All Levels of Party Headquarters for Attention: It has been reliably reported that the rebel Yan Xishan has exhausted his financial resources and is still unable to support military and political expenditures. He is now planning to mortgage the Cangshi Railway and mineral areas in Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces to imperialists in exchange for large foreign loans. It is said that negotiations are already underway. Yan Xishan has joined forces with national traitors and remnants of warlords to betray the central government and undermine unification. His heart is not only devoid of revolution but also devoid of national sovereignty. His madness has reached this point. You are hereby ordered to comply with the following points: (1) The entire population will not recognize Yan Xishan's sale of national sovereignty. (2) Request the central government to warn all countries that any treaties signed with Yan Xishan will not be recognized. (3) Request the central government to quickly dispatch troops to suppress Yan Xishan and eliminate this national traitor. Intensify propaganda efforts and strive to awaken the people to unanimously oppose him. This is of utmost importance. Central Propaganda Department Seal.</p>
<p>Telegram from He Jian in Changsha to All Newspapers for Attention: I am surprised to hear reports from Tianjin that someone using the name of He Jian's representative is in contact with the authorities in Taiyuan and Beiping, and that something is brewing. All words and actions in Hunan Province are based on the intentions of the central government. If it is necessary to send personnel to discuss current affairs on official business, there will be a prior telegraph. Otherwise, I will not be responsible for any actions taken in my name to prevent false representations. A public statement was made on the eleventh of last month. The above records are completely false. In addition to investigating the original text of the newspaper and requesting corrections, I am afraid that misunderstandings will arise. I hereby telegraph this clarification, requesting your attention. Yours respectfully, He Jian.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Tragic Sinking of Convenience Motorboat in Xiamen <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>▲Number of Deaths Reaches One Hundred Sixty to Seventy</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence, 16th: On the 10th, the Quanzhou-Hele Motor Company's motorboat "Convenience" sank in the sea between AoTou, Tongan, and Wutong, Xiamen, at 6 PM. Out of the 180 to 190 passengers, only 14 were rescued, and the rest drowned. Only 22 bodies were recovered; the rest floated away. This is an unprecedented tragedy at sea in Xiamen. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Transportation between Xiamen and the three counties of Xingquan Yong has traditionally been via small ferries at Anhai and Xiatu. However, after the Xiamen Quanzhou-Hele Motor Road opened and the Anhai to Tongan Motor Road opened, most travelers from the three counties switched to motor vehicles because they were convenient, fast, and ran several times a day. As a result, travelers flocked there, making it quite prosperous. The Quanzhou-Hele Motor Road's terminus is in Wutong, and the Tongan Motor Road's terminus is in AoTou. A small stretch of coastal waters, 30 li apart, is connected by ships. There are four motor companies from Quanzhou to Xiamen: Quanzhou-An, Tongan-Ma Xiang, Southern Quanzhou, and Hele, selling connecting tickets. From Xiamen to Quanzhou, each passenger pays 1 yuan and 4 jiao. Quanzhou-Hele provides boats between Wutong and AoTou. Originally small ferries were used, but Quanzhou-Hele, to save money, switched to motorboats named "Xiujiang" and "Convenience." Both were old and dilapidated. "Xiujiang" had to be repaired in the dock due to engine damage several days ago, leaving only "Convenience" to carry passengers. "Convenience" was built in Taiwan and was already 20 years old. It burned kerosene and residue, and the hull had long had cracks. Quanzhou-Hele bought it for 1,000 yuan and spent another 1,000 yuan on repairs. After the repairs, it was reported to the customs for inspection, which allowed it to carry 85 people. However, there were too many passengers, and the boat was insufficient, so it overloaded passengers every time. The sea between Wutong and AoTou is near the open sea, and the wind and waves are uneven. Also, it is a distance of 30 li, and the boat often listed, and the engine broke down. Passengers repeatedly warned the company, requesting a switch to small ferries, but the company responded vaguely and did not implement it. Recently, the Xiamen Jiangsheng Newspaper had published the dangerous situation twice in the past ten days and added a serious warning, but no one paid attention. Recently, because a Nanyang (Southeast Asian) ship was about to depart, there were many people from the mainland coming to Xiamen to go abroad. There were travelers all along the road from Quanzhou to Xiamen, and there was only one "Convenience" boat between Wutong and AoTou, making more than ten round trips a day. At 4 PM on the 10th, it carried nearly 200 passengers, nearly capsizing in the middle, but it still crossed. At around 5 PM, it departed again from AoTou with 180 to 190 passengers. At around 6 PM, it had traveled about 20 li. It was dusk, a gentle breeze was coming from the south, and the waves were starting to rise. The boat was overloaded, and the cracks on the right side leaked. Seawater gurgled into the cabin, and the engine room's oil tank broke. The boat stopped suddenly. Passengers were in a panic, drifting with the waves. When it reached Shuangchagang, the entire boat capsized. The boat had no rescue signal equipment and no adequate life-saving equipment. 180 to 190 passengers drifted with the waves. The crew members, Da Huo, Huang Dianzhong, the helmsman, Su Qili, the sailors Li Shuitu and Xu Luzai, all grabbed life preservers and jumped into the sea. During the day, there were many small fishing boats between Wutong and AoTou, but because it was already dusk, they had all sailed home. As a result, no one rescued the passengers. When someone who knew how to swim swam to Liuwudian to call for help, the villagers came to help with small boats, but it had been too long, and many had already sunk and because it was nighttime, it was difficult to find them. As a result, only 14 passengers and 4 crew members were rescued. All of the crew members were rescued because they had life preservers. A total of 18 people survived. The remaining 160 to 170 people were swept away by the waves. The Quanzhou-Hele Motor Company knew that there would be many passengers arriving by motorboat, so they prepared many motor vehicles to wait in Wutong. According to the schedule, it was supposed to arrive at 6 PM, but it was still not there at 6:50 PM, so they knew something had happened. They urgently reported it to the Hoshan Naval Office, which immediately sent three motorboats to sea for rescue. By that time, it was already 7 or 8 o'clock, more than two hours after the sinking. In the vast sea and in the dark night, there was naturally nowhere to find them.</p>
<p>When news of the incident reached the city on the morning of the 11th, the Siming County Party Committee's commissioners Zhang Fubin and Chen Lianfen went to Wutong to investigate at around 6 AM. The Propaganda Department issued a special bulletin urgently reporting the incident to the citizens. On the 11th and 12th, 17 bodies were salvaged in AoTou, Liuwudian, and Wutong: three male bodies, ten female bodies, and four child bodies. All of the male bodies were elderly, including Fang Tianxi from Gulangyu, who was already 88 years old. Three of the female bodies were elderly women, all around 60 years old. Seven were young women. One woman was salvaged while still tightly holding a baby in her arms. As of the 15th, five more bodies had been recovered (22 in total). From the 11th to the 13th, relatives of passengers from the Xingquan Yong counties came via Anhai to Liuwudian and AoTou to look for relatives. Anhai and Shitou Station stopped selling passenger tickets to Xiamen, instead providing special transportation for relatives to Liuwudian and AoTou. They first viewed the 15 rescued people, hoping for a miracle. If not, they viewed the bodies with grief. The sounds of weeping filled the road from Anhai and Shitou to AoTou and Liuwudian and between Xiamen and Wutong. The sadness was heartbreaking.</p>
<p>After the incident occurred, all circles in Xiamen were extremely angry, blaming the motor company for using old boats and overloading them with more than double the number of passengers without heeding warnings, leading to this disaster. They were also extremely dissatisfied with the government for not taking action to stop it. On the 13th, the Jinjiang, Nanan, Hui'an, Tongan, Anxi, and Xinghua native associations in Xiamen organized a "Wutong Convenience Boat Tragedy Relief Committee," first proposing temporary conditions to the motor company: (1) In terms of transportation, notify all stations in Quanzhou-Hele, Xiangnan, and Shuiao to provide special vehicles to transport the bodies and relatives free of charge. (2) Order Quanzhou-Hele to prepare electric boats to run to Liuwudian and AoTou, dedicated to transporting the bodies and relatives, running six times a day, i.e., every two hours. (3) The company in AoTou, Liuwudian, and Xiangnan must provide a motor vehicle dedicated to transporting the bodies and relatives, at least six times a day. If there are too many passengers, they must depart as soon as they arrive, without being bound by this rule. (4) Quanzhou-Hele must prepare two electric boats and four sailboats to search for bodies everywhere. (5) Set up reception centers for the families of the deceased in Liuwudian and AoTou, with all food and accommodation costs borne by Yu-Hele, and call on the families of the deceased to register to petition the government. The Party Department is investigating the situation and discussing solutions with the military and political circles. Police Commander Lin Guogeng said that the case would be handed over to the court for strict handling according to law. On the 15th, the tragedy committee, along with a group of families of the deceased, went to the Party Department Command to petition and demanded that the Command arrest the responsible personnel of the motor company. The Command replied that the case would be handled by the court and that the motor company staff would not escape. Even if they did, there were still shareholders. An appendix containing the tragedy relief committee's petition is as follows: "The case concerns the written petitions from representatives of the Wutong Port Convenience Boat tragedy victim families, Lin Rongya, Chen Erpo, Lin Jingquan, etc., requesting assistance. Quanzhou-Hele Motor Company has a Convenience electric boat operating between AoTou and Wutong to transport motor vehicle passengers. On the evening of the 10th of this month, the electric boat departed from AoTou with passengers to Wutong. According to the Customs inspection, the original quota was only for more than 80 passengers. On this day, the electric boat carried more than 170 to 180 passengers (the exact number is under investigation). The boat's hull was extremely dilapidated and in disrepair, and the passengers were overloaded by more than double, resulting in it sinking in the middle of the journey. All the passengers on board were killed. In addition to salvaging more than ten survivors and recovering more than 20 bodies, there are still more than 100 bodies drifting and missing. Since the accident, the company has not made any efforts to salvage the situation, leaving the families of the deceased to cry out and run around, and the bodies to drift with the waves. Their disregard for human life and cruelty are extreme. If they are not severely punished and a remedy is sought, how can the living be comforted and the souls of the dead be appeased? The families of the deceased have decided to propose conditions for assistance: (1) Please quickly order the Quanzhou-Hele Motor Company to quickly find ways to salvage the bodies. (2) Please forward this matter to the competent authorities to severely punish the main staff of the company according to law. We hereby submit this petition, requesting your review and approval. If it is implemented as requested, the living and the dead will be grateful."</p>

<h3 id="e46">Guangzhou City Opens Inland Port <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangzhou Municipal Party Bureau, in order to develop commerce, has commissioned the Public Works Bureau to plan and construct an inland port on the south bank of the Pearl River. The location has been selected in the area of Zhoutouzu Tongjin, where new land will be reclaimed, and large wharves and warehouses will be built. The port can accommodate foreign ships of up to 3,000 tons. The Public Works Bureau has prepared a written opinion, estimating the project cost to be approximately 643,500 yuan. Merchants will be invited to undertake the project, which is expected to be completed in approximately four years. The first phase of the project is expected to be completed in approximately two years. The project cost for this phase is approximately 27,000 yuan per month, and the total project cost of 640,000 yuan is proposed to be borne equally by the government and merchants. The government's share will be paid from the municipal treasury, and the merchants' share will be raised by the General Chamber of Commerce. The method of raising funds is for the General Chamber of Commerce to issue 320,000 yuan in public bonds, which will be subscribed by various merchants. It is estimated that there are no fewer than 100 trade associations in the city, and a monthly contribution of 135 yuan from each association would be sufficient. The municipal treasury would need to allocate 13,000 yuan per month. The funds advanced by the merchants will be repaid by allocating a portion of the reclaimed new land. The Municipal Administrative Council has approved this and sent a letter to the General Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it promptly develop a plan to facilitate the project. The Chamber of Commerce then raised three questions, requesting clarification from the Public Works Bureau before investing. Cheng Tiangu, the acting director of the Public Works Bureau, personally went to the Chamber of Commerce to explain to the representatives of the business community as follows: (1) Regarding the ownership of the reclaimed land, the Zhoutouzu reclaimed land is mostly owned by the Yang and Zhou families. Negotiations have been conducted with the Yang and Zhou families. If the government reclaims the reclaimed land and opens up an inland port, the ownership will be compensated with a corresponding land price or cash, and interest will also be compensated. The Yang and Zhou families have agreed. (2) Water conservancy issues, whether water conservancy is hindered, engineers have planned carefully and believe that there is absolutely no hindrance and there are great benefits. (3) Regarding the Haizhu Iron Bridge public bond, there is no conflict. The municipal government planned to issue the Haizhu public bond a few years ago, but it has been stopped midway, which is why this does not conflict. As for the guarantee of project funds, the General Chamber of Commerce can collect and manage them itself, as it has always done with road construction funds. As for the method of repayment, it is planned to issue public bonds or first issue the inland port's newly reclaimed land certificate to the General Chamber of Commerce as a guarantee. After Mr. Cheng's explanation, the business community representatives discussed the progress: (1) Regarding the proposal to share the inland port construction costs, it was decided that the General Chamber of Commerce would be responsible for raising approximately 320,000 yuan, half of the inland port project costs, on schedule. (2) Regarding the proposal to raise funds for the above project, it was decided to appoint a commissioner to handle it. (3) Regarding the number of commissioners, it was decided to appoint seven people, i.e., to appoint seven members of the Chamber of Commerce, including Mr. Zou, to be responsible for fundraising. As for the construction aspect, it is reported that the first phase of the project has been finalized, and merchants will be invited to bid for the construction soon. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e47">Northeast River Defense Begins Deployment <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>▲Limited to the Songhua River Inland Waterway</p>
<p>▲Recent Situation of the Northeast Navy</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence, 14th: The Songhua River has been ice-free for a week. The first batch of steamers departed on the 12th, heading downstream to Tonghe and upstream to Dalai. The section from Yilan downstream to Tongjiang has not yet fully thawed. Although the Navigation Bureau has scheduled the F锦轮班 to depart on the 16th, it is likely to be delayed in practice. Shipping companies here have decided that once the ice in the downstream river has completely thawed, the Tongshan steamer, which is currently in Hulin, will be ordered to return to Harbin. If there are no difficulties encountered while passing through Russian territory, several merchant ships will be designated to test the waterways of the Heilong and Ussuri Rivers. Because the length of the shipping lines has not been determined this year, the river defense deployment is temporarily limited to the Songhua River. The River Defense Fleet Headquarters has divided the Songhua River into four zones: Zone 1 is between Tongjiang and Fujin in the downstream area, patrolled by the Lij济舰; Zone 2 is between Fujin, Jiamusi, and Yilan in the downstream area, patrolled by the Liyi舰; Zone 3 is between Yilan and Harbin in the downstream area, patrolled by the Jiangqing舰; Zone 4 is between Harbin and Jilin in the upstream area, patrolled by the Jiangtong warship. The four ships are scheduled to depart from Harbin on the 27th. The sailors for each ship will be drawn from the supplementary team of sailors from the ships sunk in battle last year. The number of sailors on each ship will be doubled. Zhang Yanxue will be the captain of the Liyi舰, Wu Hong will be the captain of the Jiangtong舰, and Wang Yuyang will be the captain of the Jiangqing舰. All three were newly appointed after being transferred from the coast defense fleet and the naval headquarters. As for the naval replenishment brigade, in addition to those selected for the four ships, the old and weak have recently been eliminated, leaving less than a hundred. Team leader Huang Xun (former captain of the Jiangtai舰) has been transferred to serve as a staff officer in the fleet headquarters. The remaining captains of the Jiangheng, Lijie, and Jiangping ships, Yin Zuogan, Fan Xishen, and Yu Shoupeng, are still responsible for the training of the replenishment team. The Lijie, Jiangping, and Jiangtai ships are scheduled to be transported to Harbin in the latter half of this month for repairs at the Northeast Shipbuilding Plant. Due to the difficulty in raising funds for the construction of new warships, the Northeast has allocated 1.8 million yuan to build four ships first. The Northeast Shipbuilding Plant has contracted with a German company to purchase the hulls for the four ships and install them themselves. The displacement will be limited to 500 tons (Jiangheng is the largest ship in the river defense fleet, with a displacement of 550 tons, and Lijie and Liyi have displacements of 250 tons each), the draft will be four feet, and the bottom of the ship will be flat so that it can navigate the river without obstruction. However, each hull alone costs more than 600,000 yuan, totaling more than 2.4 million yuan for the four ships. In addition to the amount promised by the Northeast authorities, the naval headquarters plans to raise the remaining funds locally. Since Xie Zhizhou took over as the team leader of the River Defense Fleet Headquarters, the internal departments have been divided into five sections: military affairs, military science, machinery, accounting, and documentation. In addition, the Jiangyun transport department, which is directly under the naval headquarters, was originally located in the same place as the River Defense Fleet Headquarters but has now been separately established. The internal departments are divided into three sections: general affairs, accounting, and shipping. However, they are only sections in name.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Mayor of Beijing, Wei Daoming, Assumes Office <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The newly appointed Mayor of Nanjing Special Municipality, Wei Daoming, arrived at the municipal government yesterday (the 19th) at 10:00 AM to assume his duties. Former Mayor Liu Jiwen convened a meeting with all staff in the main auditorium at 9:00 AM. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Yesterday at 9:00 AM, former Mayor Liu Jiwen convened a meeting with all staff in the main auditorium to deliver his final farewell remarks. Apart from the heads of the various bureaus, approximately 200 people were present. Mr. Liu briefly stated: "Since I was appointed to resume my post as Mayor of Beijing in July of the 17th year of the Republic [1928], it has been one year and nine months. During this period, I have not seen any significant achievements that could satisfy the citizens, and I feel very sorry. Therefore, I am eager to leave, hoping that my successor can gradually make improvements and complete the construction plan. What I want to say today is: (1) The waterworks project has been completed and is expected to be finished by the end of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], which will solve the drinking water problem for the citizens. (2) The establishment of the Municipal Bank has facilitated the financial circulation of the city and can provide emergency relief to the poor. The bank's credit is now very reliable, which is a welcome phenomenon. (3) The preparation of the Municipal Library is only in its rudimentary form, and the central government has agreed to allocate funds to subsidize municipal primary education, which will greatly benefit citizen education in the future. I hope that the new Mayor Wei will continue to advance these points and complete them to fulfill the original intention. I am about to go to Shanghai, and I feel very attached to you all at this parting. I am now giving you my final farewell, and I hope you will work hard. Please take care." After Liu Jiwen finished speaking, the new mayor had not yet arrived, so he rested in the mayor's office. About 20 minutes later, the new Mayor Wei Daoming arrived in the same car with Ma Shouhua, the Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. When they arrived in front of the auditorium, the military band played music, and all the staff stood up to welcome them. After Wei got out of the car, he went to the mayor's office to meet Liu Jiwen for a brief exchange. Wei's receiving personnel, Wang Zuyi, Chen Haitao, Qi Xu, and others, eight in total, arrived at the municipal government. All documents from the secretariat and the councilor's office were checked and handed over by Secretary-General Qian Hong, Zhang Xifan, Yu Xijiu, and others. At 10:15 AM, Liu Jiwen said goodbye, and Wei Daoming saw him off to the office door. When Liu left the auditorium, all the staff stood up to see him off. Liu nodded and left hurriedly.</p>
<p>After Liu Jiwen left, the new Mayor Wei Daoming went to the auditorium and addressed all the staff, saying: "Fellow comrades, I have come here today very hastily. Because in the past few days, on the one hand, I have been dealing with the affairs of the Ministry of Judicial Administration and handing over my responsibilities, and on the other hand, I have had to attend the plenary session of the Capital Construction Committee. And Mayor Liu is about to go to Shanghai to take up his new post. Therefore, I have not yet had the time to study the actual situation of the city in detail. I cannot immediately report a specific plan on how to promote municipal administration in the future. However, I do have one feeling, which is that when the Capital Construction Committee met a few days ago, everyone believed that building the capital was extremely important and urgent. Although there are many difficulties and it is not easy to handle, everyone can work harder to achieve it. Municipal construction is of great importance, with the central government entrusting us with great responsibility and the citizens of the capital placing high expectations on us. We can only use the spirit of revolution, scientific methods, and collective efforts to jointly promote the development of municipal administration. You have been serving here for many years, helping Mayor Liu do a lot of work in the midst of hardship and difficulty. I am very impressed and still hope that you will help me do things with the spirit of helping Mayor Liu. We will have many opportunities to talk in the future, and we will talk more about it another day." After Wei finished speaking, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed him in the mayor's office, asking for his opinions on the city's municipal administration. Wei said, "Recently, I have been quite busy attending the plenary session of the Capital Construction Committee and handling the handover of affairs at the Ministry of Judicial Administration. I came here hastily today to assume my duties, but first, I will complete the internal handover and then gradually reorganize things. I will discuss long-term and great municipal construction plans in the long run to seek perfection and strive to achieve perfect results. Moreover, construction requires long-term hard work to be effective. In the future, I hope that the citizens will help the government in everything to achieve the effect of cooperation between officials and the people." As for the heads of the various bureaus under the municipal government, they had previously resigned from Liu Jiwen one after another to prepare for the handover. The candidates for the successors are said to have been internally determined: Zhu Baorou as the Director of the Education Bureau, Li Zongkan as the Director of the Public Works Bureau, Liang Weisi as the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Kong Xiankeng as the Director of the Land Bureau, Ma Shouhua as the Secretary-General, and a Mr. Li as the Director of the Health Bureau. They are expected to be announced in the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance Implements Austerity Plan <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>▲Abolish Finance Bureaus in Seventeen Counties</p>
<p>▲Rectify Provincial Tax Collection Agencies</p>
<p>Since the reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Chairman Ye Chucang and the provincial committee members, in view of the excessive difference between the province's financial revenue and expenditure, have decided to reduce the originally planned recurring expenses of the various departments and affiliated institutions, which has been approved and implemented by the last provincial government meeting. Recently, Chen Qicai, Director of the Department of Finance, based on the newly determined budget, found that the provincial revenue was still more than 2 million short each year. He proposed to abolish the two bureaus of Finance and Construction in the Xuzhou and Haizhou areas, as well as the agricultural and forestry farms, and return them to the county governments for concurrent management, in order to save expenses. After consultation among the provincial committee members, it was decided to abolish the finance bureaus in seventeen counties, including Tongshan, Fengxian, Peixian, Xiaoxian, Dangshan, Pixian, Suqian, Qiaoning, Donghai, Ganyu, Shutang, Guanyun, Chongming, Qidong, Huaiyin, Lianshui, and Yangzhong (Note: Only deputy directors were previously established in the twelve counties of Tongshan, etc., with the county magistrates concurrently serving as the directors; in the five counties of Chongming, etc., both directors and deputy directors were established). Whether to abolish the Bureau of Construction will be decided after the Department of Construction discusses it. The agricultural and forestry farms will be decided when the new budget for the nineteenth year is prepared. However, if the newly organized Security Department of Jiangsu Province is implemented according to the current proposed plan, it should require more than 2 million in annual expenses, but there is no guarantee of the source of funds. Therefore, they are currently discussing a win-win solution. In addition, Chen believes that the clearing up of tax collection agencies in Jiangsu Province seems to be inferior to Zhejiang, and he is now actively trying to rectify them in order to increase tax revenue (Riri News Agency).</p>
<h3 id="e50">Telegrams Regarding the Resolution of the Gao Bu Affair in Zhucheng <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>▲Gao Guizi Still Supports the Central Government</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Gao Guizi's troops have been transferred from Zhucheng and Juxian to Tai'an and placed under the command of Ma Hongkui. However, Gao's troops requested to set off two weeks after the siege was lifted. Chen Tiaoyuan ordered them to set off three days after being disarmed. Ma Hongkui sent Councilor Cao Jiqing to Juxian to discuss the matter with Gao, but he has not yet returned. Representatives from Zhucheng, Zhang Yan, and representatives from Juxian, Meng Ming, went to the provincial government yesterday to meet with Chairman Chen, requesting a quick lifting of the siege. Chen sent Adjutant Bai Yushan to tell the representatives to wait quietly for two or three days for a resolution. The reason for the resolution is that Gao Guizi sent a telegram to Commander-in-Chief Jiang, stating that he was still willing to be loyal to the country. Commander-in-Chief Jiang replied in approval, and Ma Fuxiang mediated. Jiang Huiruo, Cao Jiqing, Guo Nianzhen, and others also traveled back and forth. The incoming and outgoing telegrams from all parties are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Gao Guizi's Telegram to Commander-in-Chief Jiang: Nanjing Commander-in-Chief Jiang Junjian, Secret, Councilor Guo Nianzhen came to Juxian to announce your instructions. All officers and soldiers are grateful for your kindness. The troops under my command are stationed in Shandong, suppressing bandits and pacifying the people, fulfilling their natural duties. The previous Zhucao Incident was unclear, and I believe that you have insight into the rights and wrongs. Now that the party and the country are in trouble, and we are revolutionary soldiers, we should support the central government and strive for early unification. Commander-in-Chief Ma Hongkui has moved his troops to Shandong, which is a major mission. I am willing to have my troops listen to his command. If there is anything inappropriate, please instruct us to follow. Respectfully, Gao Guizi.</p>
<p>▲Commander-in-Chief Jiang's Telegram to Gao Guizi: Juxian Division Commander Gao Peiwu, Secret, Your winter telegram has been read. You are a revolutionary soldier with meritorious service. I am very pleased that you have requested to lead your troops to support the central government and return to Commander-in-Chief Ma. It should be approved and handled. In addition to sending separate telegrams, I hope you will contact Commander-in-Chief Ma to handle it and wait for further instructions. Jiang Zhongzheng.</p>
<p>▲Ma Fuxiang's Telegram to Two Representatives: Nanjing Juxian Please forward to Councilor Jiang Huiruo Councilor Cao Jiqing, Secret, Your telegram has been read. I am very pleased that Gao's troops are willing to be loyal to the central government. The proposed methods are also very appropriate and have been presented to the President for review, who agrees. The President is going to Xuzhou today, and Xiang has also telegraphed Hongkui, instructing him to ask for instructions nearby. Please tell Division Commander Gao not to lose heart and continue to lead his troops to serve the country. Xiang's efforts will be sincere. I just talked to the director of the division's office in Beijing, and we had a very pleasant conversation. I also instructed him to telegraph Peiwu. Ma Fuxiang.</p>
<p>▲Lin Wei's Telegram to Guo Nianzhen: Councilor Guo Nianzhen, Your telegram has been read. Secret, The Gao Division's problem will be resolved soon. You should wait for the case to be closed before waiting for the President's telegram to handle it. Lin Wei.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Wuhu Quick News <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>▲The Wuhu People's Food Maintenance Association convened a meeting today at the General Chamber of Commerce, inviting various organizations and public groups to discuss the food problem. It was generally agreed that the Executive Yuan's resolution to prohibit the export of rice from Wuhu has brought the food situation in Wuhu to an extremely dangerous stage. The total amount of rice stored in Wuhu is only about 30,000 piculs, which is not enough to maintain the city's food supply for half a month. As a result, it was decided that all sectors would jointly send a telegram to the National Government, stating that it would be impossible to lift the ban on rice exports from Wuhu. At the same time, they would telegraph the provincial government, requesting that it issue an order to allow the circulation of rice and grain within the province. In order to provide relief to the poor, nine organizations, including the municipal and county party headquarters, the municipal government, and the General Chamber of Commerce, were tasked with discussing solutions for implementing price stabilization measures.</p>
<p>▲Lu Xueshu, the Commander of the Capital Garrison Regiment, recently led his troops from Wuhu to Fanchang to suppress bandits. They killed more than 40 bandits and seized 34 firearms. Lu returned to Wuhu from Fanchang today and is expected to go to Fanchang again within the next few days to eliminate the remaining bandits. All captured bandits will be sent to Wuhu for interrogation.</p>
<p>▲The Municipal Public Security Bureau, acting on the order of the Provincial Party Headquarters, arrested eight reactionary young men and seized multiple pieces of evidence near the Sanmei Temple at 11:00 PM last night. They are currently being secretly interrogated.</p>
<p>▲The General Headquarters previously sent personnel to Wuhu to purchase 50,000 piculs of military rice, but only 5,000 piculs have been purchased and transported to Beijing. Recently, due to the very low rice reserves in Wuhu, they have turned to Xuancheng, Nanling, and other places to purchase rice and have requested the Wuhu Garrison Regiment to send troops to escort the transportation.

<p>Foreigner Inquires About Tax Revenue, Department Orders Refusal: Oden, the American Consul in Beijing, sent an official letter to the Zhenjiang County Government the other day, stating that the office was planning to collect the types of taxes in its jurisdiction for statistical purposes and requested that the names of various taxes within the jurisdiction of Zhenjiang County and their tax rates be investigated and listed separately. After receiving the letter, County Magistrate Zhang believed that since China was seeking autonomy in tariffs, it seemed inappropriate for foreigners to inquire about local taxes. The reason for the consul's statistics was unknown. The types of taxes belonging to the county's income were still available for reference at the County Finance Bureau. As for the province's income, it could not be clarified without the instructions of the Department of Finance. He did not dare to decide whether to investigate and reply on his own and specially asked the Department of Finance for its approval and instructions. After receiving the report, Chen, the Director of the Department of Finance, believed that local taxes were entirely a matter of internal affairs and should not be asked about by foreigners. He specially instructed the Zhenjiang County Magistrate to politely decline with the excuse that it was inconvenient to disclose them without the order of the central government.</p>

<p>Both Civil and Criminal Parts of the Zhu Jingwen Case Resolved: After repeated summons of witnesses by the County Government and court hearings, the criminal part of the Zhu Jingwen suicide case resulted in a sentence of one year imprisonment for Xu Zhicang (i.e., Zhu Jingwen's husband), which was commuted to two years probation. As for the other part, the private lawsuit for dowry compensation, Wang Jingting, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, traveled back and forth between Yangzhou and Shanghai and mediated in many ways. As a result, Xu did not appeal in the criminal aspect, and Zhu asked for concessions in the civil aspect. It is now said that Zhu has agreed. As for the various lively activities requested by Zhu, such as Xu's chanting of scriptures and holding a memorial service, it is said that Xu will also do so.</p>
<p>Education Sector Strike on the Third Day: Due to a lack of funds, the education sector in Jiangdu has suspended teaching for three days. It is now said that County Magistrate Chen has agreed that once classes are resumed, the county will be responsible for issuing half a month's salary first (about 9,000 yuan). However, some teachers and staff advocate restoring the status quo immediately, while others insist that classes will not be held unless one and a half months of expenses are issued at the same time. It is now said that half of the classes are expected to resume next Monday.</p>
<p>Xiao Yufeng After the Closure of Yongjiheng: The sudden closure of the Yongjiheng Salt Store opened by Yun Merchant Zhou Weibin has had a considerable impact on the financial community in Yangzhou. Later, Wang Jingting, the representative of the Chamber of Commerce, went to Shanghai and negotiated repeatedly with Zhou's representative, Lawyer Luo, but to no avail. It is now said that the various money shops in Yangzhou that have dealings with the store intend to formally sue it, which has also involved the various salt stores opened by Xiao Yufeng, with rumors of closing half of them. As for the funds of the Shanghai financial community that have dealings with the various money shops in Yangzhou, Wang Jingting explained the situation in Shanghai, and the money will not be recovered for the time being. However, it is not easy to release another layer before the Zhou affair is resolved.</p>

Because the matter was abnormal, after questioning, it was said that it was carved by Wu Huijun, a partner of the Zhenhua Cloth Factory. Patrol Officer Wang reported to Director Dong and summoned Wu to the General Bureau. Director Zhang interrogated him. Wu confessed that he met a friend Xu Lu on the way, who was from Yixing and served as a special agent in the Nantong Police Brigade, and ordered him to carve it. He really did not know what it was for. After the interrogation, he was sent to the Department Government yesterday for questioning and was ordered to be detained pending judgment.</p>

<p>Requesting Relief for Overpayment of Provincial Taxes: The annual provincial tax collection in Tongyi is more than 130,000 yuan, and the payment of funds requires more than 210,000 yuan. At the moment, the Finance Bureau cannot cope and has submitted a request to the Department of Finance for relief.</p>
<p>County Magistrate's Resignation Approved: The resignation of Chen Buchan, the County Magistrate of Nantong, has been approved. The Provincial Government has appointed Zhang Dong to act on his behalf in Tong.</p>
<p>All Sectors Appeal for Delay in Transferring Provincial Police Team: The First Brigade of the Provincial Police Team is suppressing bandits in the eastern township and is currently searching the Caopengzhen area. It suddenly received an order from the province to transfer to Siyang. On the 19th, various sectors of the local community held a meeting and decided to petition the Provincial Department and the General Captain to postpone the transfer.</p>
<p>Customs No Longer Inspecting and Releasing Ocean Rice Transported to Tong: A rice shortage has occurred in Tongyi. At the moment, the local community is raising funds to purchase ocean rice and transport it back for relief. On the 19th, the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs ordered the Nantong County Government that in the past two months, the county has handled more than 20,000 piculs of Shanghai rice, which should be sufficient for relief. Now that rice prices in Shanghai have soared, it is necessary to consider both sides. In the future, the inspection and release will be temporarily suspended, or it will be ordered to go to other places to purchase it. As the rice shortage is urgent here, the County Government should telegraph the Jianghai Customs to approve the inspection and release to maintain the people's food supply.</p>

<p>Negotiating Joint Defense Measures for Two Counties: Zhao Zhenhua, Deputy Captain of the Huaiyin Police Force and concurrently Director of the Public Security Bureau, went to Siyang because banditry there was particularly rampant, making it almost impossible for the people to live in peace. Furthermore, the National Army stationed in Siyang, including the battalions of Xie Bingyan, Fu Zuoxiang, and Chen Weidong, had received orders to move and gather in Xin'an Town. Should banditry break out in Siyang in the future, the Huaiyin border areas such as Songji, Xuliu, and Wangwei, which border Siyang, would likely be affected. Therefore, on the 16th, he took a car to Si County to discuss joint defense measures for the two counties with County Magistrate Zhang Hongzhu and Public Security Bureau Director Xu Xinyou.</p>
<p>Capturing Bandits Who Attacked Pizhuang: On January 29th of this year, at dawn, a band of over a hundred bandits suddenly arrived at Pijiazhuang in the Fifth District of Huaiyin, breached the village defenses, and looted all the property, including cattle and donkeys. They also kidnapped fifty-one villagers. Although twenty-eight people were released on the evening of the same day, twenty-three people were still held for ransom. When the money was not received in time, Xu Huaizheng, one of the hostages, was shot dead as a warning. Subsequently, a total of over 1,700 silver dollars were extorted before the remaining twenty-two people were released one after another. Lu Zhongxian, Captain of the Second Squad of the Fifth District Police stationed in the county, recently reported that a bandit named Feng Yuyuan was involved in the case. Feng was arrested on the 13th, and confessed under interrogation. He also implicated Pi Renshan and Pi Chunshan, who were also arrested and sent to the brigade headquarters. After questioning by Brigade Commander Zhao, they were handed over to the county government for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Detailed Account of the Suppression of Bandits at Laohuzhuang: At around 10:00 AM on the 16th, a large band of four to five hundred bandits suddenly attacked Laohuzhuang in the Moshu District from four directions, setting fire to straw stacks along the way. Sun Xudong, the squad leader of the county police stationed in the village, led his troops and the militia to meet the attack from different directions. After three hours of fierce fighting, Squad Leader Sun held his ground, awaiting reinforcements. Subsequently, the militia from the Cheshi and Maping Wuyao districts, as well as the police from Kuang Shiying's First Squad, arrived to provide assistance. The bandits still resisted stubbornly. While the two sides were locked in a stalemate, Tang Dongru, the squad leader of the Tang Squad, arrived with his troops upon hearing the news, and joined the battle. The attack intensified. The bandits even used machine guns to strafe our troops, but before the bullets could be fired, the bandit holding the gun was shot and killed. The bandits then retreated westward. At this time, it was already 1:00 PM. In this battle, twenty to thirty bandits were killed and Zhu Yeying was captured alive. One light machine gun, one rifle, one pistol, one native cannon, one shoulder-fired gun, and one native gun were seized. The notorious criminal Shen Erhu and five other vicious bandits were beheaded and their heads were displayed on the four gates of the city as a warning to the public. Three soldiers from Sun's squad, Li Jiazan, Wang Yulin, and Sun Zhanliang, sustained minor injuries and have been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Brief News: (1) The county government has newly purchased 139 rifles and 69,500 rounds of ammunition, which were transported to Rugao yesterday. (2) The Rugao Housheng Store received 1,500 bags of Saigon rice from Shanghai yesterday. (3) The sixth district in the southwest of the county has suffered repeated banditry and the harvest has been poor, causing food shortages and panic among the people.

<p>Situation After the Military and Police Recaptured Si'an: Although Changxing Si'an Town suffered no major losses after being occupied by bandits for twenty hours, five residents died. One was a carpenter, one was a flower carver, one was a young girl from a paper shop, one was a farmer, and one was a Henan person. All of the deceased were injured by stray bullets during the fighting. Afterwards, Regiment Commander Hang and the National Army battalion commanders Feng and Lai jointly issued a notice to merchants and residents to resume business as usual. The National Army and the security forces were stationed in the town, and the 11th Water Police Team was dispatched to defend Lincheng Bridge and Hongxing Bridge. Patrol Team Leader Yu was responsible for security. After the bandits withdrew from Si'an, they dispersed and fled towards Guangde, Anji, Changqiao Pass, and Dawu Mountain. Therefore, when Patrol Team Leader Yu arrived at Hongxing Bridge, he heard that over two hundred bandits had fled from Si'an and were hiding in Qianzi Village near Dawu Mountain. The team leader led his team to Dawu Mountain this morning to suppress the bandits.</p>

<p>County-Wide Police Conference: The newly appointed County Magistrate Shen Guangxiong, since assuming office, has paid special attention to defense. Furthermore, since the communists near Li Ze Yaozhuang Bridge have occasionally taken extreme actions, he specifically ordered all Public Security Bureau and police substation inspectors to hold a county-wide police conference in the county government hall the day before yesterday (the 16th). Several detailed rules for bandit prevention were discussed in order to ensure joint defense.</p>
<p>Bundling of Kidnapping Cases: The widow of Xu Xiangqing from Baimao River in Xitang, who was living with an old woman in a dilapidated house, was discovered by bandits. Last night, they broke into the house and kidnapped her, demanding a huge ransom for her release. Furthermore, two women surnamed Wang, an aunt and a daughter-in-law, were kidnapped in Changbang, and a ransom of 5,000 yuan was demanded, but an agreement has not yet been reached.</p>

<p>Highway Bureau Purchases Rice to Aid Road Workers: Chen Ticheng, Director of the Provincial Highway Bureau, stated that the road workers on the Hangchang and other roads lacked food, and yesterday specifically requested the Construction Department to forward a request to the provincial government for permission to purchase and transport 3,000 shi of Anhui rice for relief.</p>
<p>Bandits from Changxing Flee to Anji: The Zhejiang Provincial Government received a telegram from Anji County Magistrate Zhang Songnian stating that over 2,000 sword-wielding bandits, after being severely suppressed by the military and police in Si'an, were detouring south through Meixi and eyeing Anji. In addition to declaring martial law and deploying defenses, the county town's military strength was weak. He requested that a large army be quickly dispatched to suppress them. It is reported that the Central Training Corps has been ordered to rush to assist in the suppression.</p>
<p>Opening of the Hangzhou County National Goods Exhibition: The Hangzhou County National Goods Mobile Exhibition opened yesterday (the 19th) at 2:00 PM. Over 800 representatives from various agencies and groups, including Shao Ji, Lu Xingzhuang, and Zhang Baoshan, attended. The chairman reported on the preparations, stating that the Hangzhou County National Goods Promotion Committee planned to convene a mobile exhibition of national goods factories in Hangzhou in order to promote national goods. It was decided that the county government and the county party headquarters would actively prepare. Coincidentally, the Hangzhou Municipal Government invited national goods factories from Shanghai and Hangzhou to hold a meeting in Hangzhou. Therefore, it was agreed that holding a strong promotional event during this time when there were many tourists would be beneficial. Representatives were immediately elected to negotiate with various manufacturers, requesting them to sacrifice a few more days after the closing ceremony and hold another meeting in Hangzhou. The manufacturers, understanding the importance of the situation, unanimously agreed. Housing was borrowed from the Youth Association to facilitate the event. Therefore, the opening ceremony was held today. Subsequently, Shao Ji, former Director of the Construction Bureau of Hangzhou County, Lu Xingzhuang, Chairman of the Shanghai National Goods Factory Union, Jiang Senyu, representative of the National Goods Cigarette Maintenance Association, and others delivered speeches before dispersing.</p>

<p>Preventing Bandit Disturbances: Shaoxing rice prices are soaring repeatedly at this time of year when the new harvest is not yet available, making life difficult for the people. In addition to ordering villages to raise funds and handle price stabilization, County Magistrate Tang is deeply concerned that unscrupulous individuals in the mountain villages will take advantage of the situation to create disturbances related to security. Yesterday, he specifically ordered the Public Security Bureau to dispatch troops to be stationed near Kezhen and other mountain villages in order to suppress them. He also dispatched another team to patrol the mountain areas with the Keqiao Public Security Bureau to avoid any accidents, as Keqiao is an important town on the western route.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Xiaoshan <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Farmers in Sanjiang Township Robbed: The family of Tong Yonggui, a farmer in Sanjiang Township, Xiaoshao, had some savings. On the 17th, in the middle of the night, several bandits suddenly came with flashlights and pistols, broke down the door, and ransacked the house. They looted all the cash, clothing, and other valuables, estimated to be worth over 400 taels of silver.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Continue to Rise: Xiaoshan rice prices have been rising repeatedly recently due to the disappearance of sources and the scarcity of inventory. It is reported that on the 17th, the price of all kinds of white rice rose by another 20 cents. Three-grade white late white xián rice cost 17.2 yuan, and two-grade cost 17 yuan. Furthermore, both grades were reduced to second-class. Three-grade rice is not as good as the previous two-grade rice. Lower grades are available in name only but not in reality. With such expensive rice during a famine year, how will the common people make a living?</p>
<p>Provincial Order to Investigate Village Boundary Dispute: The Ren Sheng Village Committee in the northern part of Xiaoshan and the Eastern Township Autonomous Association are disputing the tax land around Shengwei. They have repeatedly filed complaints with the county government. The county government has ordered the committees to provide detailed reports on the actual situation in order to make a determination. However, the Ren Sheng Village has ignored this order for months. The Department of Civil Affairs has now ordered the county government to investigate and handle the matter quickly. After receiving the order, the county government immediately ordered the committee to determine whether the sandy land of Cai Shuikui and Lu Zhongyue is located on the eastern side of Cuiwei Youshou Stone Mouth, which is a boundary line directly from the northeast two-township border, or on the western side of the boundary line. A detailed report must be submitted within three days without delay.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the conference was in recess... Visiting the Mausoleum, Sightseeing, and Banquet</p>
<p>This afternoon... Opening the Fourth General Meeting</p>
<p>The Second National Education Conference was on its sixth day yesterday, Sunday, which was a day of recess. There were visits to mausoleums, sightseeing, and banquets. The situation is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Visiting the Mausoleum and Sightseeing <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>▲ Solemn Ceremony to Visit the Remains</p>
<p>▲ Sightseeing at Ancient Temples and Scenic Spots</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the conference was in recess. At 9:00 AM, the Reception Section prepared fifteen cars to take the members to visit the Mausoleum of the Premier. Prior to this, the Ministry of Education had specially produced silver-shielded wreaths in Shanghai to be respectfully presented when visiting the Mausoleum. At around 9:00 AM, the members took the cars and departed. At 9:40 AM, they arrived at the Mausoleum. Among those who participated in the visit were members of the conference, including Jin Zengcheng, Zhu Jingnong, Wang Maozu, and Meng Xiancheng, as well as ninety staff members from the two sections of the conference's reception affairs. At 10:30 AM, Jin Zengcheng, as chairman, presided over the ceremony to respectfully visit the Premier's Mausoleum. (1) Everyone stood in silence. (2) Three bows in salute. (3) The chief celebrant respectfully offered the wreath. (4) Three minutes of silence. (5) Everyone filed into the tomb to pay respects. (6) Ceremony completed. Afterwards, the Premier's Mausoleum Management Committee specially opened the tomb chamber. The members queued up and entered the chamber to pay respects. The Premier's coffin was placed in a circular tomb chamber inside the Premier's mausoleum. The coffin was made of white marble and had a full-body sculpture of the Premier's remains on top. A wreath presented by Sun Ke was placed in front of the tomb chamber. The members entered the chamber and paid their respects. After the visit, they filed out. A reporter from this newspaper took a group photo of all the visiting members and staff in front of the memorial hall. After the photo was taken, the members took cars to the invitation of the Yizu School and visited the school. Zhang Shengyi, the director of school affairs, prepared tea and snacks for the reception. After the visit, the members went to Linggu Temple for sightseeing. The temple is an ancient temple from the Southern Dynasty, with dense ancient trees and secluded scenery. The peonies in the temple were in full bloom. Many members carried cameras and took photos inside and outside the temple. At noon, the Ministry of Education prepared a vegetarian meal for the members at the temple.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Welcome Meeting at Yizu School in the Morning <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>▲ Speeches from All Sides Hope to Continue the Legacy of the Martyrs</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM on the 20th, all the teachers and students of the Yizu School held a meeting in the auditorium to welcome the members of the conference. Jin Zengcheng took the stage to give a speech, stating that it was a great honor to visit the school during the holiday. The term "Yizu" (orphans of martyrs) is thought-provoking, making people remember the martyrs. The martyrs sacrificed themselves for the Three Principles of the People and the National Revolution. In the Premier's will, the phrase "to seek freedom and equality for China" has not yet been realized because of the collusion between warlords and imperialism, which has created obstacles and caused the martyrs to fail. It is regrettable. You are the children of revolutionary predecessors. You should emulate the great achievements of your fathers and brothers who sacrificed themselves for the National Revolution, carry on the legacy of your ancestors, and strive for knowledge and revolution. Then, Huang Shiheng, Director of the Education Department of Hunan Province, gave a speech, stating that we have what we have today because of the martyrs. He hopes that the children of the martyrs will receive the most perfect education, so that the seeds of revolution can continue the glory of the martyrs and not let down the hard work of the martyrs. Wu Jiaxiang said that Directors Jin and Huang, one from Guangdong and one from Hunan, are both from the birthplace of the revolution. What they said are all true words. The north is closed and there is nothing worth mentioning. I hope that you will emulate and continue the legacy, so that the destruction of today can be replaced by the success of construction. Finally, Zhang Shengyi, director of school affairs, reported that there are currently 308 students and more than 80 students who have registered but have not been admitted. Because it is the beginning of the school, the equipment and resources need to be expanded but that requires expenses. Although 450,000 yuan has been raised, the money has not been fully collected, so the school affairs have not been able to actively expand according to the plan.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Reception at Jing City Schools in the Afternoon <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>▲ Director Gu Shusen of the Municipal Education Bureau Gave a Speech</p>
<p>At 12:00, the members went to Linggu Temple for a vegetarian meal. At 2:00, they drove to the Central Hotel. At 4:30, the Jing City Education Bureau and the principals of various municipal schools welcomed the members of the conference at Wuzhou Park. About 60 members of the conference attended. After taking their seats, Gu Shusen, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, gave a speech, stating that the education situation in Jing City can be divided into two aspects: quantity and quality. In terms of quantity, there are more than 60,000 school-age children in the city, and more than 50,000 children who are out of school. In addition to the more than 13,000 people who have not been admitted, the promotion of compulsory education is imperative. Nanjing is the capital, and its image is at stake. He hopes that the members will focus their efforts and promote its realization. In terms of quality, although there are five experimental primary schools that are experimenting with new educational methods, the economic equipment is difficult to achieve the ideal goal, and it also relies on the members' supervision. Jiang Zexuan was publicly elected by the members to give a reply, stating that today they came for leisure and enjoyed a short rest. He was also pleased to meet comrades from the city's education community at the same time. Director Gu is an expert in vocational education, and he will definitely be able to promote the improvement of education and align it with the purpose of construction. The director is also an educator in rural education. Today, rural education is a top priority. I know that Director Gu will definitely be able to contribute his strengths to set an example for the whole country. In the past, the malpractice of education was to imitate foreigners. Now, starting from experimentation is in line with the national conditions. The capital has five experimental primary schools, and there are also various gatherings every week. I know that the progress of primary school education in Jing City is just beginning. It is a pity that time is tight and I cannot visit all the schools. If we can find a method that is suitable for the national conditions in the future, please enlighten us. The meeting adjourned at 6:00.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Grand Banquet at National Central University in the Evening <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>▲ Vice President Dai Hopes for Cooperation from the Education Community</p>
<p>▲ Jin Zengcheng Said Efforts Should Be Made to Create an Academic Center</p>
<p>▲ Zhuang Menglin Said Development Should Be Based on Needs and Characteristics</p>
<p>National Central University hosted a banquet for the members at Anle Hotel at 7:30 PM on the 20th. More than 50 people, including Jiang Menglin and Jin Zengcheng, attended. Vice President Dai and Wang Yaochen and Liu Zaobin were responsible for the reception. At the end of the banquet, Vice President Dai stood up to give a speech, stating that President Zhang Junmou of the university was unable to return today because he was involved in the examination affairs of the third county magistrate examination in Zhejiang Province. He specifically telegraphed to entrust his brother to represent him in welcoming the members. He remembered that the previous conference was held at the university. Now, because the capital is under construction and the university is still under construction, the school could not hold it this time. Therefore, the conference was changed to be held at the Department of Railways. He hoped that everyone would work hard to help the school construction, so that the third conference can be held in the school again. Since the opening of the conference, there have been banquets every day, but apart from the banquet of the Ministry of Education, which was one family, the rest were more polite. The guests and hosts had a lot of polite words. Tonight's banquet at the school belongs to one family, so there is no need to be polite. Therefore, he sincerely requested three things from everyone.</p>
<p>A photograph of the members in front of the Premier's Mausoleum yesterday.</p>
<p>(Taken by Nanjing Guanghua)</p>
<p>First, the school is large in scope, and the shortcomings in the progress of the various departments are inevitable. Please criticize and correct them. Second, higher education in the country seems to be suffering from the disease of stacking beds. At this time when the country's finances are exhausted, it seems that everyone should work together and each school should strive to develop its own characteristics. In this way, the malpractice of double consumption can be avoided. Third, the connection between universities and secondary schools is very close. He also hoped that those who are researching secondary and social education will give us instructions to do well by the society of university graduates and primary education. The reception was inadequate, and he sincerely wished everyone good health with thin wine. Jin Zengcheng gave a reply, stating that Central University was reorganized from Nango and Dongda. In the past, there were six high normal schools in the country, and the one with the best performance was Nango. The operators had too much political color, which is another problem. However, the achievements cannot be denied. Central University inherited the good foundation and it will be easier to develop. Central University is the highest institution in the capital. He hopes that it will strive to create an academic center in the future to set an example for the whole country. The day before yesterday, President Jiang mentioned in his speech to pay attention to rectifying the academic atmosphere. He remembered that two years ago, Central University students had several disturbances over the school name issue. In the past two years, there have been no more disturbances in Central University. It can be seen that your school authorities have had new effects in rectifying the academic atmosphere. As for the issue of cooperation in education, it is indeed a top priority. There are six libraries in Guangzhou City, but each pays attention to the development of its own characteristics, so it is quite effective. This is the effect of cooperation. I am very grateful for the grand banquet hosted by Central University today, and I would like to thank you on behalf of the members. Jiang Menglin spoke from the point of view of developing needs and characteristics, expressing much sympathy.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Reading the Teacher Training Program (2) "Difference" <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The success or failure of the teacher training program has a significant impact on the future of compulsory education. During this Second Education Conference, the majority of members considered the teacher funding and resources components of the compulsory education program very important and felt that a detailed discussion was necessary. Mr. Wei Tingsheng, Mr. Jiang Menglin, and others believe that the teacher issue is even more difficult to solve than the funding issue. These insightful remarks are very perceptive. Minister Jiang also pointed out that according to educational statistics from Zhejiang Province, even if all junior high school graduates received teacher training, it would still not be enough. From these results, we can infer that the difficulties in culturally backward provinces and regions are far greater than those in culturally developed Zhejiang. Therefore, the issue of teachers is something that we must pay attention to. During this conference, the desire for the widespread implementation of compulsory education on the one hand, and the failure to promote teacher training in many ways on the other, are truly concerning. It has been the custom in China since the late Qing Dynasty to provide free meals to normal school students. Children from poor but excellent families have been able to attend school, and as a result, many excellent people have become elementary school teachers, dedicating themselves to the cause of primary education in our country with remarkable results that are evident to all. In the current plan, the system of providing free meals has been abolished, and it is deeply feared that this will cause great panic in normal schools across the country in future student recruitment. In Zhejiang, few students enroll due to the collection of meal fees. In Jiangsu, the number of candidates increased significantly after the normal school program switched from collecting meal fees to providing free meals. All of these facts prove that normal school students should not be charged meal fees. Furthermore, if we want to achieve universal education in the future, we must focus on rural areas, and the training of teachers should particularly emphasize farmers' children. In our country, where the national economy is weak, how can the average farmer afford the cost of their children's meals, books, and supplies at normal school? Therefore, we must either abandon the idea of universal education in our country altogether, or if we want to achieve it, the first problem to be solved must be the issue of free meals. If national finances make it difficult to bear this significant expense, then at the very least, we must maintain the excellent system of not collecting meal fees for training elementary school teachers. It is my sincere hope that the members of the conference and government authorities will give this careful consideration.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Implementation of Educational Plans and Local Educational Administration by Xia Chengfeng <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>During the ten-day session of this National Education Conference, the educational plans successfully developed by dozens of experts over several months will undoubtedly be revised to perfection. The value of these plans will only become evident after implementation begins. However, the difficulties encountered during implementation may not be entirely due to flaws in the plans themselves. During the discussions on the merits and demerits of the plans, it is also natural to open up one or several more crucial paths for their implementation. Otherwise, the various educational conferences held in our country over the past one or two decades, no matter how lively, and the so-called plans, no matter how numerous, have only resulted in the joy and encouragement on the conference floor and the flowery language in the conference reports. The resolutions are passed on to the desks of education directors and bureau chiefs. The important ones cannot be started, the secondary ones are lightly filed away, and those that do not align with personal tastes are not even worth a smile.</p>
<p>Experience tells us that such phenomena do indeed exist. The mission of this conference is at least related to the success or failure of education in the next two or three decades. We must have more precise discussions on the critical junctures in the implementation process of the plans in order to avoid repeating past mistakes. The so-called precondition to preconditions in the process is naturally the broad financing of education. However, even if educational funding experiences rapid development in one or two years, without reforming the educational administration system, or even due to the sudden increase in funding and improper management and use, it is sufficient to completely bankrupt the educational spirit of a locality. The author believes that we should pay attention to two issues based on the current needs of education:</p>
<p>(1) Where should we look for the starting point for the implementation of the plans?</p>
<p>(2) From whom should we seek feedback on the implementation of the plans?</p>
<p>From the perspective of the plan itself, the content of the plan connects the central, provincial, and county education systems, including senior high, junior high, and primary education. None should be favored over the others. Naturally, the education administrations at all levels are responsible personnel. However, the most complex and difficult task is to promote the universality of education. After decades of efforts that have resulted in countless flaws, there is an urgent need for practical plans to rectify the situation or start anew. Other countries calculate the number of illiterate people in terms of per thousand, while we still hold onto the figure of per ten. The sooner education becomes universal, the sooner the country's status will improve. The education sector should currently devote all its efforts to universal education. For example, it would not be excessive to demand that the current plan give special attention to universal education.</p>
<p>The implementation of universal education has always been based on the county as a unit. The most important person responsible for implementing universal education is the county education bureau chief. If, after the plan is passed, the Ministry of Education transmits the plan regarding universal education to the Provincial Department of Education, which then transmits it to the County Education Bureau, and the County Education Bureau Chief still holds it without any solution and ultimately files it away, it would not only waste the efforts of many experts, but would also leave local education with no hope of revitalization. The fact that the Education Bureau Chiefs hold it without any solution should not solely be blamed on their lack of effort. There are many reasons for this, which can be listed as follows: 1. Lack of determination to make progress; 2. Too few and too poor support staff; 3. Funding constraints preventing bold advancement; 4. Lack of assistance from superiors; 5. Lack of cooperation within the education sector; 6. Disorderly teachers; 7. Interference from related organizations; 8. Local feudal forces creating obstacles in everything; 9. The individual himself is not satisfied with being the bureau chief, but only temporarily using it as a retreat or for recuperation; 10. Most of the time is spent on raising funds, resolving difficulties, and maintaining the status quo, leading to mental and physical exhaustion; 11. Lack of guidance, preventing them from taking action; 12. Fundamental lack of understanding of education; 13... and so on. To summarize, (1) the bureau chief is not the right person, (2) the organization is unsound, (3) the provincial education administrative agency fails to assume the responsibility of guidance and guarantee, and (4) the administrative power is too small, the scope of work is too complex, and the dual responsibilities of funding and operation are concentrated in one person.</p>
<p>Most local education exists in such a parasitic state. Excellent talents often give up after a slight attempt. Simply seeking to get through a year safely is already difficult, and even then, a certain amount of anxiety and hidden pain is inevitable. As a result, provincial education directors often feel that local education is too troublesome and difficult to manage. If such a state is not first eliminated and eradicated, and the implementation plan, which is related to the new life of future education, is lightly placed in such an environment, the result can be foreseen. Recalling the initial stages of local education in China, in a state of complete unpreparedness and lack of methods, the power of education was lightly taken over from the hands of successful candidates in the imperial examinations and even commoners. As a result, localities with the ability to run education were governed by the people themselves, and schools and villages were governed by themselves. Localities with weak economic capacity and cultural backwardness were happy to be uninvolved in both public and private matters. Three to five schools were established in a county of hundreds of miles as mere decorations. Now, all we see is the non-standard, deformed development, and the more backward becoming even more backward. How painful this is! To ensure that this plan does not become a mere formality, I fear that some paths for reforming local education administration must first be established.</p>
<p>1. The selection of leaders for local education administration: Observing the current situation, county education bureau chiefs are more likely to be competent in economically prosperous and culturally advanced areas. However, sometimes, due to the abundance of talent and the formation of various factions, improper appointment methods may still lead to disputes. This gives rise to two issues: the selection criteria and the method of appointment. From the perspective of legal evolution, the qualifications for bureau chiefs in the Education Bureau Regulations of 1923 have been significantly raised. However, for the sake of a law applicable throughout the country, the minimum standards cannot but be lowered, which affects the entire system. The current solution is for the central government to stipulate the minimum standards for each level of phased improvement, while each province formulates its own separate regulations. Without raising these qualifications and without restricting those who do not understand education, local education will be completely helpless. At the same time, the treatment should be commensurate with the qualifications and duties. Usually, the standards and treatment for bureau chiefs in small counties are low, which urgently needs to be corrected in the provincial administration. Small counties are in need of development and require the most capable talents, otherwise, they will forever lag behind. The appointment method also varies. The method of having the county magistrate recommend several people and the provincial education director select one person is the most meaningless and irresponsible. Some bureau chiefs are appointed through comparative selection, but what can be compared is only the evidence on paper, which is also unreliable. A more progressive method is, of course, the examination system, but what is tested is knowledge, not character and talent. If examinations are used as a preliminary selection, followed by a longer period of training and practice, it seems easier to find the right person. If the treatment is improved, this system may be feasible. After considerable observation and practice, the local concept of "must use local people" can be eliminated. This requires effort from the provincial administration.</p>
<p>2. Administrative expenses should not come from local education funds. The expenses of the Education Bureau have traditionally been paid out of the education fund, which is inevitably subject to proportional restrictions. Low salaries for bureau chiefs make it difficult to find the right person, and low salaries for bureau staff make it difficult to recruit them. The administrative operations themselves cannot be streamlined due to the lack of funds. Because the funds for local are derived from local areas, they are regarded as a local organziation. The province only having the right of appointment and removal makes active management difficult. The combination of administrative fees and operating expenses, with the same source of funding, is prone to abuse. In places where the funding is too low, such as a bureau chief's salary of 20 or 30 yuan a month, is clearly ridiculous. To avoid various difficulties, the administrative expenses of the Education Bureau should be paid from the provincial revenue. Only then can the administrative expenses and budgets be subject to strict periodic review. Increasing the annual expenditure by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan across the province will significantly help the educational spirit and administrative management. Even if it cannot be fully implemented for the time being, in places where funding is more difficult, no one will be willing to make fruitless sacrifices unless this is done. Alternatively, the province and county can each share half of the salaries and office expenses, as determined by the province, which is a more progressive approach than the current system where the province's management is only a formality. With the bureau chief appointed and paid by the province, and the management of local affairs, local obstacles and misunderstandings can be reduced and more easily understood. The salaries of bureau chiefs and staff can be effectively increased, allowing those who are dedicated to this work to support their families, reducing economic pressure and the temptation to change careers.</p>
<p>3. The provincial government should be responsible for local education funding. An education bureau chief with fundraising abilities is easily supported by the general public and trusted by superiors. Those with educational aspirations and knowledge but lacking accounting skills and acumen are often unsuccessful and leave. What a paradoxical phenomenon! Those engaged in education should fundamentally recognize that abolishing miscellaneous taxes is the way to alleviate the suffering of the people. However, on the one hand, they have to adopt the principle of collecting even the smallest amounts to scrape together funds to maintain current operations. Open up the education tax items of various counties and conduct an examination. If miscellaneous taxes are resolutely and strictly abolished, local education may immediately become completely bankrupt. What another paradoxical phenomenon! The provincial education administration treats local education as if it were allowing ragtag armies to forage everywhere and raise funds locally. As a result, the disputes, complexities, and malpractices arising from funding completely bury the educational spirit and meaning of a locality. The provincial government considers it a local issue and cannot have a thorough reform plan. The supervision, restrictions, admonitions, and prohibitions on paper are at most related to the individual bureau chief, but paper is ultimately just paper. Education bureau chiefs should ask more about education, but ask less about finance or social interaction. This way, talents can be more specialized and pure, and education itself can benefit from administrative efficiency. The provincial government should have a comprehensive management system for local education funding, which cannot be the sole responsibility of one or two staff members. If the education banking system is adopted, with branches in each locality, and formal banking procedures are used for deposits, withdrawals, interest, loans, and mortgages, most of the disputes or malpractices can be reduced. The audit aspect should have a dedicated processing agency to prevent bureau chiefs from covering up the situation and deceiving superiors. The source of funding should not be left to the local government to handle piecemeal. The provincial government should designate several major taxes as special funds for local education, and strict restrictions should be placed on the taxes freely collected by each county. At the same time, attention should be paid to the clearing and collection of local education assets. In short, education bureau chiefs should only be concerned with the distribution and restriction of expenditures, while the provincial government should be extremely responsible for the increase, collection, and custody of revenue, with precise procedures, plans, and specialized agencies and personnel. Let the "education bureau chief" devote their full energy to running "education" and help the "education bureau" quickly escape the era of the "education tax bureau."</p>
<p>4. The centralization of local education administrative power: In places where feudal forces are most entrenched, education bureau chiefs are like puppets. Each village has its own master, and the education bureau chief has no say in the modification of plans or the advancement or retirement of personnel. As for the observance of laws and regulations, the improvement of teaching, and the report of guidance, since the education bureau chief is not the master of education management, it is like the autumn wind blowing past the ears. The education bureau is equivalent to a dummy, only dealing with matters perfunctorily. The provincial government should grant the education bureau chief full authority and provide full protection and assistance within the framework of provincial principles and plans, so that local education does not remain parasitic on feudal forces forever. Of course, local education should cooperate with society and not harbor narrow-minded views. However, cooperation is cooperation, and interference is interference. During the period of political tutelage, to hope that excellent bureau chiefs will be appointed to reorganize local education, the entire enterprise should be fully entrusted before it can be started. In order to complete the degree of local autonomy as soon as possible, the provincial administrative authorities should first decide on their attitude. If they are determined to reform, they should find ways to do so fundamentally.</p>
<p>5. The issue of teacher consolidation: The disorder of local teachers is self-evident. However, the responsibility for the disorder should be borne by the past education administrative authorities. The quantity of teachers required for their promotion of education was not commensurate with the need. They had no precise standards and procedures for selecting teachers, they had no power to interfere with landowning principals who appointed unqualified teachers, they had no way to train new teachers, and they had no way to ensure that in-service teachers improved and did not fall behind. In the end, intentionally or unintentionally, year after year, they filled the education sector with unqualified teachers. This is not the fault of the teachers. Those who are unqualified are not retained here, and there are other places for them to be retained. They do not necessarily have to be teachers. Even if they are willing to be teachers, if the restrictions are stricter, they can make more preparations in advance. Those who are unqualified were already employed, and then they took inspection and other coercive measures to barely justify themselves. This is something that those of us who have been involved in education administration work should feel ashamed of. For the current consolidation, from the fundamental perspective, we hope that the education sector will pay serious attention to the issue of teacher training without being prejudiced. From the symptomatic perspective, due to the distribution of talents in each province, the standards for primary school teachers at each level should be stipulated in phases. Those who meet the minimum standards should strive to prove themselves and prepare to raise their rank within the effective period of their service. After several years of joint efforts to reach the standards set, each locality should not be allowed to appoint teachers below the prescribed standards. Of course, teacher consolidation is more complex than any other issue. The organization of provincial education administration should have a section dedicated to teacher issues, establish a consolidation plan for several years, and strictly implement it. With such assistance, education bureau chiefs will be comparatively more courageous in implementing their proposals.</p>
<p>The above points can be felt by comrades who care about local education. Of course, they may not agree on the solution. We hope that experienced education administrative authorities can pay more attention to this issue and study ways to solve it.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Educational Opinion (4) by Gao Junshan <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>(4) The evolution of clothing is not entirely accidental. It must be suitable for the national conditions in order to be established and sustainable. Western suits are suitable for the environment and equipment of Westerners. In China's environment, they are too thin in winter and too thick in summer. This is a common complaint among those who wear Western suits. Therefore, Western suits are not suitable for China's environment.</p>
<p>(5) Chinese clothing is very simple and easy to make beautiful. Western suits must be made of exquisite materials and good workmanship, and must be carefully maintained at all times to be presentable. If one or two Western suits are prepared and worn from the beginning to the end of the year, covered in oil and full of wrinkles, it is even more unsightly than unpretentious Chinese clothing.</p>
<p>(6) Chinese clothing is more convenient and does not take much effort to wear.</p>
<p>(7) Chinese clothing is more comfortable. The fact that many people who wear Western suits often change into Chinese clothing when they return home is clear evidence of this.</p>
<p>(2) Methods</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Education should issue a circular to all large, medium, and small schools across the country, strictly requiring them to use domestic materials to make domestic clothing, and instructing them to wear out their existing Western suits before no longer producing them.</p>
<p>National Scout Jamboree (Chinese Photography)</p>
<p>(2) The Ministry of Education should instruct the principals and deans of students in each school to be responsible for supervising and encouraging students, and to encourage each other among colleagues and classmates to implement this ministerial order.</p>
<p>(3) Local education administrative agencies should send personnel to investigate the extent to which large, medium, and small schools are making efforts to implement this circular, and commend and commend them to show encouragement.</p>
<p>(4) Schools should be responsible for social publicity.</p>
<p>(5) Staff of education administrative agencies at all levels should lead by example.</p>
<p>(Note 1) Domestic clothing is a collective term for long and short garments.</p>
<p>(Note 2) Using domestic goods to make domestic clothing does not mean wearing uniforms.</p>
<p>(Note 3) If domestic clothing is inconvenient or does not meet the principles of hygiene and beauty, it can still be fully improved, but it should not imitate the clothing of any other country.</p>
<p>▲School flags, emblems, school songs,</p>
<p>slogans, etc. should all use domestic</p>
<p>language</p>
<p>(1) Reasons</p>
<p>(1) An independent country has its own language and writing to express itself. Looking at schools today (especially universities), Western languages are often regarded as fashionable. The slogans, school flags, emblems, and even the slogans on sports caps and sports clothing sometimes use purely Western languages. Even the school songs sung at the closing ceremony and the slogans shouted during sports sometimes use English. This purely Westernized practice is truly heartbreaking. We often deplore the invasion of Eastern and Western cultures, but these kinds of actions are not invasions by others; they are simply accepting them wholeheartedly and rejecting our own country's language to use the language of others. This is not only losing the national identity, but also incurring the ridicule of foreigners.</p>
<p>(2) Methods</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education should issue a circular to the education departments of each province, instructing all schools to replace all Western-language slogans, school flags, school emblems, school songs, slogans, etc. with domestic language. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Performances held... Visited the Mausoleum Today</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of the National Scout General Inspection. The sky was clear and bright, and various groups held performances in the afternoon. Dai Jitao also gave a speech to the Scouts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. This morning, they visited the mausoleum of Generalissimo Sun Yat-sen and held a memorial week. The situation is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e87">Camp Situation <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Since there was news of the cancellation of the large-scale camp earlier, the preparation for the large-scale camp was relatively negligent. The sudden announcement of the camp on the 17th must have been made in haste. After one night's allocation, the situation gradually became ready during the lighting of thousands of lamps, truly a grand occasion. The camp area was originally planned to be surrounded to maintain order more easily, but due to budgetary reasons, it could not be done. Therefore, the camp area was abnormally chaotic. Fortunately, the Scouts of each group were experienced and built fences to divide and guard the area. Visitors were amazed and admired. Among them, several groups built beautiful words with branches, which is worthy of praise and truly a lively manifestation of the children's heaven.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Afternoon Performances <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>

The performances included over ten categories: drills, climbing, semaphore signaling, camping, first aid, cycling, human pyramids, message signaling, bridge building, fire starting, knot tying, national martial arts, military band, and firefighting. Scout troops actively participated, demonstrating agility and coordination, garnering audience praise. The event concluded late in the evening. Detailed results are still being compiled.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Dai Jitao's Address <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>| Dai and His Wife Inspect Barracks |</p>
<p>| Speech to the Liangjiang Boy Scouts: |</p>
<p>▲The Two Most Important Words in Life Are Courtesy and Righteousness</p>
<p>▲Parents, Teachers, and Friends Are Crucial to One's Lifelong Career</p>
<p>▲Adhere to Tenets and Embrace a Spirit of Sacrifice</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 20th, Dai Fu-xian, Chairman of the general inspection and grand encampment, accompanied by his wife, inspected the scouts' residences and offices, and toured the barracks. They saw many children cooking and preparing fragrant dishes. Dai smiled and said, "This food smells really good!" At this time, Lu Lihua, principal of Liangjiang Girls' School, invited him to give a speech to the school's scouts. Dai agreed and delivered a speech, stating: "Brothers, my throat is sore today, and my voice is not clear. Please forgive me. What I want to say to you, I already said at the assembly the day before yesterday, and now I will say it again: The two most important words in life are courtesy and righteousness. These two words, courtesy and righteousness, should not be interpreted in a pedantic way. By courtesy, we mean the organization of human society, and by righteousness, we mean social action. If these two words are lost, the nation will inevitably decline. The Chinese have made this mistake. Therefore, Chinese boy scouts must revitalize these two words. Furthermore, the decline of Chinese women's education and the weakness of their bodies are self-evident. They naturally suffer everywhere when undertaking social endeavors. However, in education, there are four major things related to one's lifelong career: father, mother, teacher, and friends. Education is evident everywhere in the habits of our people. A father picks up two big eyes and a stick – this is the father's education. A mother offers her breasts. A teacher, like the old-fashioned tutors, has treasures in his hands – roasted chestnuts, candy, slaps, and a wooden stick. Friends deceive each other. This is the education of teachers and friends. With social education like this, how can China not be weak? Moreover, only one-tenth of the Chinese people have received education, and even fewer are women. The number of women serving as girl scouts is even smaller. However, the responsibility of promoting the girl scout movement rests on your shoulders. Do not think that wearing scout uniforms and hats makes you scouts, forgetting your great responsibility. Therefore, I hope that you will spread the good education you have received from your parents, teachers, and friends, and take on the responsibility of creating a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. In particular, you must abide by the scout tenets, embrace courage and a spirit of sacrifice, serve the country, and serve society. You must transform more girls in the villages into scouts, and that will be the success of your mission." Finally, Principal Lu Lihua of the school gave thanks, and the event concluded.</p>

<p>▲Office Pays Attention to the Weather</p>
<p>Sends Someone to the Central Meteorological Institute to Inquire</p>
<p>The office, due to the uncertain weather lately, with alternating sunshine and heavy rain, which is causing difficulties for operations, sent a Boy Scout service member to the Central Meteorological Institute this morning to inquire about the weather from today to the 22nd, and whether there will be rain, in order to arrange the schedule. However, the report only provided the weather forecast for today, which is warm and clear with haze, and poor visibility. The weather for the 21st and 22nd will need to be inquired about at 7:00 AM on those days, and cannot be predicted. Therefore, the office still faces difficulties due to the uncertain weather.</p>
<p>▲Soliciting Opinions on Boy Scout Affairs</p>
<p>At yesterday's Boy Scout Affairs Discussion Meeting, due to time constraints, attendees were unable to fully express their opinions on Boy Scout affairs in order to reach a perfect conclusion. Therefore, at the end of the meeting, someone suggested that the headquarters create forms for the Boy Scout service members to fill out, which the headquarters would compile and publish the results in the newspapers. It is said that the office has decided to proceed with this plan.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Jiangdu Party Headquarters Commends Boy Scouts <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Since the date for the National Boy Scout General Inspection was set, the training department of the Jiangdu County Party Headquarters has joined forces with local agencies and organizations to form a preparatory committee. On the one hand, it held a general drill in the county ahead of time, and on the other hand, it raised 800 yuan to subsidize the participating groups and purchase equipment. A total of four groups, with more than 200 people, came to Nanjing to participate in the general inspection. As a result of the inspection in Jiangsu Province, the county's 60th and 59th groups won the first and second place banners, respectively. Yesterday, Tao Zhonghe, the head of the training department, came to Beijing to purchase a large number of supplies and food to commend the groups for their exceptional efforts, and to encourage them. Each member of the 60th, 59th, 97th, and 123rd groups received a towel, a bottle of olives, two cans of biscuits, and two fragrant sausages, which were distributed to the group leaders this morning.</p>
<p>▲Office Telegraphs He Yingqin</p>
<p>He Yingqin, the commander of the Chinese Boy Scouts, is very enthusiastic about the Chinese Boy Scout cause. During the general inspection and grand encampment, he happened to be in Hankou on official business. When he left Beijing, he was afraid that he would not be able to return in time, so he instructed Shi Weihuan, the director of the office, to telegraph the inspection progress at any time. It is reported that yesterday, Director Shi of the office sent a detailed telegram to Hankou reporting on the general inspection, grand encampment, and campfire, as well as Chairman Chiang's enthusiasm for the sponsorship.</p>
<p>▲Funny Stories During the Heavy Rain</p>
<p>During the heavy rain on the 19th, some groups took shelter in the camp, while others went to the camp to get raincoats. In the midst of this chaos, three or five Boy Scouts played pranks, taking the opportunity to steal other people's leather shoes, causing a few boy and girl scouts to become barefoot immortals for a while. Also, the camp ropes were like a net, and if you were not careful, you would trip over them, so many mud bodhisattvas were added to the ranks of the barefoot immortals. Moreover, some people slept soundly and were not disturbed by the heavy rain until they woke up and realized the trouble the rain had caused.</p>
<p>▲Number of Groups at Inspection</p>
<p>As of the morning of the 18th, a total of 142 Boy Scout groups from various places have come to Beijing to participate in the general inspection.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Recent Developments in the Jiangsu Provincial People's Education Institute Experimental Zone <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Huangxiang Experimental Zone of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Education Institute has spared no effort in promoting various educational facilities within the zone. A summary of the zone's recent work is recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Implementing Compulsory Literacy: After the conclusion of the first phase of the zone's people's schools, in order to achieve literacy for all people in the zone, the Improvement Conference decided to implement compulsory literacy starting in March of this year. All residents of the zone between the ages of twelve and twenty must attend people's schools. Those who are absent without reason for one week must pay a "foolish people" fine of 30 cents of silver. The Township Office submitted this measure to the county government for record. The Wuxi County Government also sent a literacy police officer to be stationed in the zone for a long time to persuade and guide. The program has been implemented for almost two months and the results are very impressive. Almost all those who should attend people's schools attend every day to learn to read.</p>
<p>(2) Organizing Mobile Teaching: For residents of the zone who are over twenty years old and not within the compulsory age range, and who cannot attend people's schools due to household chores and other constraints, the zone's staff compiles mobile teaching materials and goes to the farmhouses in turn every day at 4:00 PM to conduct individual teaching, but it is not compulsory. More than seventy people in the zone are receiving this education, mostly women. The oldest of them is fifty years old, and she is also studying diligently to learn to read, which is admirable.</p>
<p>(3) Establishing Nurseries: This semester, the zone established a nursery, renting two civilian houses as the site. There are 20 children, aged four to six, who are cared for in the nursery. The zone's female staff are responsible for guiding them.</p>
<p>(4) Guiding Township Offices: The zone's staff guides the township office in carrying out various local autonomy tasks within the zone, such as household registration, neighborhood selection, road construction, and banning gambling and smoking. Members of the Improvement Association are even more enthusiastic in assisting and participating in everything.</p>
<p>(5) Conducting Monthly Household Cleanliness Inspections: In addition to the People's Hospital clinic providing daily medical consultations for residents and organizing health campaigns and promoting various sports, the zone also conducts monthly household cleanliness inspections on the 15th of each month. The four items of the bedroom are inspected, and guidance is provided at any time. Those with excellent results are given honorary awards at public gatherings. As a result, household cleanliness has greatly improved compared to before.</p>
<p>(6) Holding the Second Children's Health Competition: On the 17th and 18th of this month, the zone held the second children's health competition, with more than 70 children participating. The inspection items were divided into two categories: physical condition and medical aspects. Each participating child received a gift bag of candy. Two children in each age group from one to six also received four or five practical prizes each. An awards ceremony was held on the evening of the second day, accompanied by various children's health promotions and entertainment.</p>
<p>(7) Editing Various Teaching Materials and Reports: The various people's school teaching materials edited by the zone, such as the People's Reader, which is a mixed compilation of party principles, literacy, and common sense, People's Songs, People's Calligraphy Practice Books, and People's Small Series, are widely promoted. The People's Reader has recently been reprinted, with sales reaching more than 5,000 copies. Regarding the first year of experimentation, the book "Huangxiang Experimental Zone" was specially edited, recording everything in great detail. The price is 40 cents per copy.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Fudan Will Offer a Summer Term National Defense Chemistry Specialty <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>▲Studying Military Poison Gas</p>
<p>▲Strengthening Borders and Defending Against Foreign Aggression</p>
<p>Lin Jiyong, the dean of the science department of Fudan University in Shanghai, believes that with the current global war clouds, future wars will surely break out. The United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and other countries are spending vast amounts of money to vigorously explore military poison gases. Our country's national defense is lax, and there is no preparation whatsoever, which is a major danger. Last autumn, he added a military chemistry course, hiring Han Zukang and others as professors, and produced seven kinds of chemical weapons, which were publicly demonstrated, with satisfactory results. This was the first time this had happened in universities across the country, as has been reported in various newspapers. It is now known that the school, in order to strengthen the borders, defend against foreign aggression, and cultivate self-defense talents, will offer a "Summer Term National Defense Chemistry Specialty" this summer, from July 1st to August 9th, for a total of six weeks. Each week will consist of 24 hours of lectures and practice. The courses offered include: Introduction to Poison Gas, Explosive Chemistry, Calculation of Explosive Power, Poison Gas Manufacturing, Poison Gas Tactics, Research on Smoke Screens and Incendiary Devices, Protective Masks, Explosive Manufacturing, and Poison Gas Testing Methods. Admission qualifications: Anyone with a letter of introduction from a school or public institution who passes the entrance examination will be admitted. Those who complete the course and pass the examination will be issued a certificate. The enrollment quota is set at 50 people, and no more will be accepted when the quota is full. The prospectus is being printed. The important reasons for the school's offering of the National Defense Chemistry Specialty are as follows: (1) Although the history of chemical warfare is only a little over ten years, the diligence with which various countries research and the number of inventions are amazing. Although the Hague Peace Conference explicitly prohibited the use of poison gas by belligerent countries in 1899, when the European War broke out, each country acted in its own interests, and the use of poison gas increased. The Hague Treaty was just a formality. (2) We must recognize that national defense chemistry is a protector, not a destroyer. We must research the properties of various poison gases and their antidotes, and the manufacturing methods of anti-gas equipment, in order to protect the soldiers fighting for the country on the battlefield. We must research the manufacturing methods of smoke screens to prevent enemy aircraft from attacking, so that public buildings and cultural institutions in the country can be spared from destruction. (3) No citizen with a sense of national defense does not want to study this subject in order to resist foreign aggression. The school gave a performance last winter, which attracted the attention of military, political, and academic circles across the country. Therefore, in-depth research should be conducted to make a contribution.</p>

<p>Shanghai Qunzhi University, founded nearly ten years ago, has had considerable achievements. However, last autumn, after a change of leadership, some students withdrew from the school. The Ministry of Education has reportedly heard about this and has issued a notice to suspend the school during the summer term. It is now reported that the school has convened a meeting of school directors stationed in Shanghai and has drafted a concrete plan to strive for perfection. They have jointly requested the Ministry of Education to revoke its decision. The school's student union has also sent representatives to the Shanghai Education Bureau to explain the events of last year's upheaval and the school's current situation, and to request the Education Bureau to forward the request to the Ministry of Education, requesting that it be maintained in order to preserve academic pursuits.</p>

<p>▲ Representative to the World Power Conference</p>
<p>▲ Publicly Recommended by the Federation of Private Electrical Enterprises</p>
<p>▲ Departing by Ship on the 29th of This Month</p>
<p>The Second World Power Conference is about to be held in Germany. The Chinese government has appointed three representatives to attend. One of them is Mr. Huang Boqiao, the director of the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, who set sail on the 15th of this month, as previously reported. The Federation of Private Electrical Enterprises has also nominated two representatives. One of them is Mr. Li Yanshi, an electrical entrepreneur, who is scheduled to depart for Germany on the 29th of this month aboard the Derfflinger. Mr. Li is a senior student who studied in Germany and Austria and has held important government positions. He was originally a legal expert but, recognizing that China's industry and commerce were underdeveloped and that the electrical industry was the foundation for developing various industries, he devoted himself to electrical engineering. He pioneered China's first long-distance power transmission project, the Zhenhua Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Plant, and was the first to promote agricultural irrigation projects. To this day, production has increased in the Changzhou and Wuxi areas, and farmers have benefited from this. Recently, he has been running the electricity business in his hometown of Huzhou with great success. The chairman of this Second World Power Conference, which will be held in the German capital, Mr. Kou Degen, came to China last year and met with Mr. Li, personally inviting him to attend. Recently, he sent another telegram urging Mr. Li to attend, stating that the conference will discuss various electrical regulations and that Mr. Li, as a legal expert, would be indispensable. Therefore, Mr. Li had no choice but to reluctantly accept the public recommendation of the Federation of Electrical Enterprises and go to Germany to attend. It is believed that Mr. Li's participation in this conference will contribute greatly to solving legal issues related to public utilities around the world.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Government received an order from the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating that the National Beiping Research Institute had sent a letter stating that the old files stored in various provinces and cities were of great importance to historical research materials. If they were not specially preserved, it was feared that they would disappear over time. It requested that the matter be presented to the Executive Yuan and then to the National Government, ordering all agencies in various provinces, cities, and counties to properly preserve the old files or hand them over to academic institutions for preservation and organization, and not to destroy them arbitrarily. The ministry found that the files in various provinces, cities, and counties were of great importance to institutions and cultural relics. All materials that could be used for historical research should be cataloged and carefully preserved. The institute's request was not without merit. The original letter should be copied and presented to the Executive Yuan and then to the National Government, ordering all agencies in provinces, cities, and counties across the country to comply with it for the sake of public convenience. The case was then forwarded to the Executive Yuan, which was then submitted to the National Government with the instruction that all documents were understood and had been submitted to the 66th National Affairs Conference for deliberation and approval. The order was issued to the Executive Yuan for compliance. In addition to the separate orders, the government was ordered to comply immediately and instruct its subordinates to comply with it as a whole.</p>

<p>▲ Russian Diplomatic Committee Refuses</p>
<p>The Directorate General of Posts previously reported that the postmaster of Jilin and Heilongjiang reported that the mail coming and going from the post offices in the area, along with the mail carriers, either on ships or on the way, had been robbed by the Soviet army, and many of the mail items delivered to the Russian post office via the Ussuri Railway had not been received to this day. The Directorate General of Posts then submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications and forwarded it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for negotiation. The bureau recently received an instruction from the Ministry of Communications, which stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had replied that the German Embassy in China had stated that the case had been negotiated with the Russian government but had been rejected by the Russian Diplomatic Committee. The reason given was that the claims made by China were within the territory of the three eastern provinces. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia meant that the case should be negotiated directly with the Soviet representative in Harbin by the Chinese authorities. In addition to ordering the Jilin Special Envoy to comply, a corresponding consultation was requested for verification.</p>

<p>▲ Rice Subsidies to Be Issued on May 1st</p>
<p>County Chief Leng of Shanghai County, seeing that rice prices have been rising recently and people are finding it difficult to eat, sent a special letter to the Property Management Office to organize a fair price for rice. Subsequently, the office decided to subsidize the price of rice, according to the method of the ninth year of the Republic, giving money instead of grain, and replied to the county government for approval. It is now learned that the county government has decided to start the program on May 1st. The Property Management Office believes that the deadline is approaching and immediately sent letters to the district chiefs, urging them to quickly investigate and verify the extremely poor households within their jurisdictions and report back within a few days so that subsidies can be issued separately.</p>

<p>▲ Observing China's National Economy from the Perspective of Import and Export Trade</p>
<p>At 3 p.m. yesterday, the Shanghai YMCA held its seventh academic lecture, given by Dr. Shou Yicheng. The following is a summary of his speech:</p>
<p>There should be two types of liquidation in China's national economy: one is domestic liquidation, and the other is international liquidation. From the perspective of domestic liquidation, (1) scarce production, (2) large consumption, (3) leisurely production, and (4) rapid consumption are the most common phenomena in China's current economic sphere. In other words, in terms of production, no industry is backward, and in terms of consumption, no matter is forward. The result of the liquidation is always negative rather than positive, and deficient rather than surplus. If we look at the liquidation in international trade, it has been 66 years since the third year of Tongzhi (i.e., 1864). Among them, exports exceeded imports in only six years: 1864, 1872, 1873, 1874, 1875, and 1878. In the remaining 60 years, imports exceeded exports in every year. This is the first pathological condition. Foreign markets are shrinking by leaps and bounds, and the power of foreign merchants is permeating the hinterland. This is the second pathological condition. Export merchants lack sufficient capital and lack sound organization. This is the third pathological condition. The development of international trade depends on the agility of international finance. China lacks incentives for export trade credit guarantee systems, and the international exchange business is mostly controlled by foreign banks. This is the fourth pathological condition. Whether the ocean transportation industry is developed or not is closely related to the expansion of foreign trade. In China, foreign transportation and marine insurance businesses have either died prematurely or have not yet sprouted. This is the fifth pathological condition. Protectionist trade policies are a necessary means to encourage the development of domestic infant industries. In China, however, tariffs and miscellaneous taxes are everywhere, and export excise taxes, which are explicitly prohibited by the U.S. Constitution, are regarded as an important source of revenue in China. Economic suicide cannot be avoided. This is the sixth pathological condition. Trading in good faith has been China's old tradition. However, in recent times, export merchants only seek immediate, temporary benefits and disregard the credit of various industries abroad. Adulteration and forgery are ubiquitous, so that Chinese merchants, who were once known for their credit, have become unscrupulous elements with falling credit in international trade. Moral bankruptcy is the ultimate bottom line. This is the seventh pathological condition. All countries in international trade try their best to avoid the disadvantages of passive trade and indirect trade and aim at achieving automatic trade and direct trade as a common goal. China is passive and passive, indirect and indirect. Therefore, it is nominally foreign trade, but in reality, it is trade with foreign firms or trade with compradors. Oppression, aggression, exploitation, and fraud are ubiquitous, and the most severely affected are export merchants or farmers and workers who have a close relationship with export trade. They are shortsighted, ignorant, and unable to extricate themselves from harming the country and harming the community. This is the eighth pathological condition. All of the above are important reasons why China's export trade cannot be fully developed. However, the scientific study of international trade should first be based on facts. Therefore, we will compare and analyze the past and present development of import and export trade over the past 60 years in order to adapt to the trend and strive to</p>
<p>The current situation and trends of China's international trade can be roughly divided into the following points for discussion: (1) Observing from the total value of trade, China's total international trade volume was 843 million Customs Taels in the first year of the Republic of China, and 2.423 billion Taels in the eighteenth year, an increase of more than three times. This cannot but be considered a considerable improvement. (2) Observing from the amount of trade deficit, since the opening of the sea ban, trade deficit has become common. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the amount of trade deficit has been increasing year by year. From the first year of the Republic to the eighteenth year, there was no year without a trade deficit. However, it decreased slightly during the European War. In the eighth year of the Republic, the trade deficit fell to 16 million Taels, which was a rare good phenomenon in the last 40 years. It is a pity. This cannot but be considered one aspect of the unhealthy state of the national economy. (3) Observing from the changes in important export commodities, the position of China's important export commodities in international trade, if viewed from a vertical historical perspective, was initially tea, followed by raw silk, and recently by soybeans. Since 1864, with relevant records available, the general outline can be listed as follows, with ten years as a period, divided into six periods, and with the position of export goods in recent years following them.</p>
<p>Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Notes</p>
<p>1873 Tea Raw Silk Cotton Soybeans</p>
<p>1883 Tea Raw Silk Cotton Soybeans</p>
<p>1893 Tea Raw Silk Cotton Soybeans</p>
<p>1903 Raw Silk Tea Cotton Soybeans (A) Eggs Peanuts (A) Refers to the number in 1904</p>
<p>1913 Raw Silk Soybeans Tea Cotton Peanuts (B) Tung Oil Eggs (B) Refers to the number in 1914</p>
<p>1923 Raw Silk Soybeans Cotton Tea Eggs Tung Oil Peanuts</p>
<p>1925 Raw Silk Soybeans Cotton Eggs Tea Tung Oil Peanuts</p>
<p>1927 Soybeans Raw Silk Cotton Tea Eggs Tung Oil Peanuts</p>
<p>1928 Soybeans Raw Silk Tea Eggs Cotton Tung Oil Peanuts</p>
<p>From the table on the right, we can see the possibility of development of various items in export trade. However, the increase in soybean production is mostly due to the Japanese management of the eastern provinces. Therefore, it is not enough to be deeply gratified. The two major export commodities of tea and silk, which have always been famous in the world, are now overwhelmed by Ceylon tea and Japanese silk. This is a true economic national shame that cannot be denied. (4) Observing from the supply and demand of important commodities, the import of cotton cloth has always ranked first in import trade. The second is either sugar, rice, wool, or cotton yarn. The import of rice has been increasing year by year, which is a strong proof of the lack of food and the decline of agriculture in our country. It is also sufficient to show that the food problem needs to be solved urgently. The gradual decrease in the import of cotton yarn is due to the change to the import of fine yarn and the development of foreign companies operating yarn factories in China. However, the development of the domestic yarn industry is also one of the important reasons. Furthermore, observing the import trade statistics for the 17th year of the Republic of China, the import value (A) was over 100 million Taels for cotton goods, (B) 90 million Taels for sugar (this is the highest number in recent years and a new record in the history of China's import trade), (C) over 60 million Taels for cotton, metals, minerals, and kerosene, (D) over 40 million Taels for wool products, (E) over 30 million Taels for candles, tobacco, flour, and chemical products, (F) over 20 million Taels for grains, paper, silk products, fish, seafood, cigarettes, hemp, and coal, (G) over 10 million Taels for machinery, wood, meat products, cotton yarn, dyes, synthetic indigo, and leather. These can all be produced in China or can be replaced by domestic products. However, due to frequent internal strife, bankruptcy of all industries, poor technology, and difficult odds, there are cases where foreign goods are used to replace domestic goods, while there are few cases where domestic goods are used to replace foreign goods. If all sectors of the national economy can strive to "replace foreign goods," then promoting domestic goods will have practical significance, and it will be a matter of course to transform the trade deficit into a trade surplus. (5) Observing from the export trade of various industrial products, China's foreign trade has been exporting raw materials and importing foreign goods for many years, which has become a fixed pattern. The export of industrial products can be said to be minimal. However, in recent years, the export of machine-made foreign goods has increased significantly, which seems to be part of the evidence of the progress of domestic manufacturing. During the 14th year of the Republic of China, the total value of machine-made foreign goods exported was over 2.2748 million Taels. In the 15th year, it was over 26.656 million Taels. In the 17th year, it was 39.57 million Taels, an increase of about ten times. The increase in the export of this kind of foreign-style machine-made goods can prove that China's products have gradually occupied a minimum level of power in overseas markets. It can also be seen that this industry has gradually tended to develop. However, among these export goods, some are transported to Hong Kong and then re-enter China from Hong Kong. Some are manufactured by factories set up by foreign merchants in China, so we cannot but pay attention to them. (6) Observing from the import trade of special industrial products, the machinery in China's industrial products has always been supplied by foreign countries. Therefore, the number of machinery imports each year can be said to be a barometer of China's industrial progress. During the second year of the Republic of China, the import of machinery was valued at just over 4.65 million Taels. In the eighth year, it increased to 14 million Taels. In the tenth year, the highest number was over 55 million Taels. Recently, it is still over 19 million Taels. All of these situations can be used as a standard for estimating the rise and fall of China's industry. However, there are many foreigners who have set up factories in China, and the machinery purchased and used by foreign factories must also account for an important part of it. Therefore, it cannot be used as the only standard for China's industrial progress. (7) Observing from the source of intangible exports, a trade deficit is not always detrimental to a country's economy. Take the United Kingdom as an example. There is hardly a year without a trade deficit. In 1926, it was 470 million pounds, and in 1929, it was 366 million pounds. However, the United Kingdom's national wealth does not seem to be damaged. The intangible exports of the United Kingdom are of great value, such as ship freight, interest on foreign investment, commissions, and insurance premiums. China has an annual trade deficit, but there is a huge amount of silver imported every year. In the past two years, the amount has been over 100 million Taels. The reason for this is that remittances from overseas Chinese to their homeland are the most important source. They use investment to enrich their country, and we use labor to alleviate our poverty. Although the labor and leisure are different, and the work is different, they are governed by the principle of adapting to the environment. The amount of foreign investment in China is also huge, and attention should be paid to it. These imports that are not seen in the customs registers are mutually causal with China's various tangible export trades and are closely related. (8) Observing from the destination of tangible imports, in the early years of Daoguang in the former Qing Dynasty, import and export trade was concentrated in Guangdong. During the reign of Daoguang and Xianfeng, it gradually extended to the treaty ports along the Yangtze River, such as Shanghai and Hankou. After 1893, Tianjin and Niuzhuang gradually became important. After 1903, Jiaozhou and Dalian gradually emerged, and Harbin's market in land international trade became increasingly important. The shift in the situation is generally centered on the development of new transportation facilities such as roads and waterways. As transportation becomes more convenient, the production industry progresses. As the production industry progresses, the people's purchasing power increases. As the people's purchasing power increases, the destination of tangible imports expands. The situation is natural and difficult to resist. What should be repeatedly added to the meaning is that whether to import or not should be determined by whether we need it or not. Whether to give up or take, the power is in our own hands. Why should we allow foreign goods to overwhelm domestic goods, so that a good market becomes the tail of another country's industry? (9) Observing from the position of the total international trade volume of various countries, we can further observe China's position in the world's international trade. Before the European War (1912), the United Kingdom was definitely in the first place, Germany was in the second place, and the United States was in the third place. After the war, this situation fundamentally changed. The United States has jumped to the first place in global trade, and the United Kingdom has retreated to the second place, followed by Germany, France, Canada, India, Japan, Italy, Argentina, Belgium, and other countries. As for China, the amount it occupies in the world's trading arena was slightly higher in 1927, ranking ninth, compared to the twelfth place before the war. However, what we should pay attention to is that global trade has increased significantly after the war compared to before the war. The ratio of 37.797 trillion Gold Yuan in 1927 to 26.800 trillion Gold Yuan in 1913 means that 1927 increased by nearly 70 percent. Under this situation of rapid increase in world trade, China's international trade is bound to keep pace, but it is still considered that the progress is too late and too slow. (10) Observing from the average trade volume per capita in proportion to the population of various countries, from the actual figures of international trade,</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Observation, China always ranks 12th in the world. If we observe from the proportion of population, China is indeed always at the bottom of the world in every year. According to the statistics of the League of Nations, the largest average trade volume per capita in the world is Aden, with more than 800 Gold Yuan per capita, followed by the British Malaya Archipelago, New Zealand, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Newfoundland, with an average of more than 200 Yuan per capita. The average trade volume per capita in the United Kingdom is 188.88 Gold Yuan, Belgium is 171.88 Gold Yuan, France is 92.58 Gold Yuan, Germany is 74.61 Gold Yuan, the United States is 76.13 Gold Yuan, Japan is 33.27 Gold Yuan, and China's average trade volume per capita is only 2.96 Gold Yuan, the least among all countries. China can indeed be proud of its large population, but is it not too much of a disadvantage in terms of trade in proportion to the population?</p>
<p>From the above, we can see that if China's international trade is to be fully developed, the ways to focus on are roughly as follows: First, the implementation of protectionist trade policies. After the war, the governments of Europe and the United States all regarded encouraging export trade as the only policy to restore economic strength. Therefore, they spared no effort in protecting and encouraging basic industries. The Chinese government has repeatedly ordered the abolition of tariffs and miscellaneous taxes, and it is bound to be implemented. Policies to reduce and exempt export taxes, appropriately increase import taxes on special manufactured goods, and protect emerging industries and encourage export trade have also been planned by the authorities. This is what the government should strive to do. Second, countries engaged in international trade generally have strong capital and sound organization. China's economy is immature, and it is not easy to follow suit for a while. However, in order to compete in the international commercial arena, those engaged in international trade must be first-class entrepreneurs, and sound organization is a necessary condition for the success of foreign trade. This is what export merchants should strive to do themselves. Third, the auxiliary institutions of international trade are established by the government and by private individuals. It is generally recognized that they are necessary for the development of foreign trade. China already has a clue about the establishment of international exchange banks, export commodity inspection agencies, industrial and commercial visiting agencies, and commercial commissioners stationed in restaurants. However, the organization of auxiliary institutions such as the International Trade Research Committee and the National Export Trade Association, as well as the solution of problems such as increasing the convenience of international transportation, are still to be awaited in the near future. This is what the auxiliary institutions should strive to do. If Chinese youths can clarify the issue of export trade development as a matter of life and death for China's economic sector and can contribute to the scientific research of international commerce and the psychological construction of developing foreign trade movements, then it will be the blessing of the future of the national economy.</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed Request for Reduction of Silk Tax in Zhejiang Province <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government regarding the request for reduction of silk tax in Zhejiang Province: "To the esteemed Zhejiang Provincial Government in Hangzhou: On the 17th of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Silk Industry Branch stating, 'We believe that the weight of tax rates and the price of goods are inherently causally linked. In recent years, the silk industry in Hangzhou has suffered repeated blows from foreign-made products, struggling to defend itself. At the same time, foreign merchants in the Shanghai concessions are also using the shield of their tariff agreements to further seize the leadership of China's silk trade. Therefore, silk fabrics produced within the Shanghai concessions are exempt from taxation on both raw materials and finished products. Even when transported and sold inland, they only need to pay a light sub-port tax. From this point of view, considering the weight of the burden, it is self-evident that the cost of silk fabrics in Shanghai and Hangzhou is inevitably different. Consequently, the competitive power between the two is also clearly different. In this situation, if we want to save the decline of the Hangzhou silk industry, the only way is to quickly abolish the silk tax, just like in the Shanghai concessions. We are attaching a comparative table of silk fabric tax rates in Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Shanghai for your reference. We dare to ask for your attention and assistance so that the silk industry and commerce in Hangzhou and Shanghai can bear the tax burden at a uniformly average ratio, which will not only revive the declining silk industry in Zhejiang but also deeply benefit the national economy and people's livelihood.' A comparative table was attached to the letter. After checking the silk fabric tax rates in Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai listed in the table, Hangzhou's rate is the highest, followed by Suzhou, and then Shanghai. Comparing the differences, for each piece of silk fabric, the largest difference is 2 yuan per piece compared to Suzhou goods, and almost 3 yuan compared to Shanghai goods. The smallest difference is more than half a yuan compared to Suzhou goods, and more than 1 yuan and 3 jiao compared to Shanghai goods. Even if factory wages and other expenses are higher in Shanghai than in Hangzhou, Suzhou and Hangzhou are adjacent, and their economic conditions are similar. However, the tax rates in Suzhou and Hangzhou, based on the four items examined, differ by as much as 2 yuan, 1 yuan and 7 jiao, and 1 yuan and half a yuan per piece. The major reason for the drastic decline of the Hangzhou silk industry in recent years is the excessively heavy tax burden. The unemployment of workers and the prevalence of vagrants are enough to cause hidden worries, and the closure of silk crepe factories has led to a sharp decline in production. Although the tax rate has been increased, the tax revenue will inevitably decrease, which is detrimental to public finances. In our humble opinion, even if the Hangzhou silk tax rate cannot be the same as Shanghai's, it should be proportional to Suzhou's to avoid unequal treatment. Otherwise, the negative consequences may lead to the gradual relocation of the Hangzhou silk market to the Shanghai concessions, allowing foreigners to enjoy the benefit of chasing away birds from the bush, while Hangzhou loses the source of livelihood for hundreds of thousands of people, which is not a good plan. Therefore, we do not hesitate to bother you and submit the comparative table of tax amounts, requesting your esteemed government to review and consider it for implementation, which is truly for the public benefit. The Shanghai Special Municipality Merchant Groups Reorganization Committee bows. Xiao."</p>
<h3 id="e120">Difficulties in Recruiting Labor for Road Construction in Baoshan <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>▲ Various Public Organizations Submit a Petition to the Construction Department Requesting Flexible Handling</p>
<p>Since Baoshan received the instruction from the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department to implement labor recruitment for road construction, the Construction Bureau and the heads of various sections have encountered many difficulties. Despite repeated setting of work dates, no one has reported for work. The Baoshan County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee, Public Funds and Public Property Management Office, Education Bureau, Education Association, Census Bureau, Luodian Chamber of Commerce, Transportation Affairs Office, First District Party Headquarters, and the Fifth District Public Office, considering that hasty labor recruitment would inevitably lead to incidents, jointly submitted a petition to the Construction Department, requesting it to consider the special circumstances of the county and approve flexible handling. The petition is recorded below: "We respectfully submit this petition regarding the numerous difficulties in recruiting labor for road construction, detailing the facts, and earnestly requesting that you consider the special circumstances and approve flexible handling to provide relief. The recruitment of labor for road construction is a general matter and should be carried out in accordance with the order. Our county has organized an assistance association to help with the implementation. After repeated detailed discussions, it was unanimously agreed that the county's north-south and east-west roads have been completed in order, and the debt burden for road construction is already substantial, which is not expected to be paid off in a short period. Moreover, based on past experience, the cost of earthwork only accounts for about 6% of the total expenses (including bridges and culverts), while land prices, house and tomb relocation, cinder, bridges, and all other projects are not included. Considering the county's financial resources, land prices cannot be allocated, and the cost of bridges and culverts is even greater. Therefore, immediate action cannot be taken, and the unfinished dirt roads are useless. To complete them, it is estimated that each li requires 2,000 yuan, totaling more than 100,000 yuan. How can we raise funds when the previous debt has not been cleared? Previously, we jointly requested the Baoshan County Government to submit a petition to your department, requesting that the extra mu tax for road construction, which is higher than other counties, be used as a substitute payment to hire workers for construction. However, several months have passed without a reply from your department. Later, we repeatedly received strict orders from former Director Wang to proceed, and the authorities had no choice but to reluctantly comply, separately investigating each household in accordance with the regulations, compiling a register of labor recruitment, and submitting it for the record. Immediately afterward, work start dates were set and efforts were made to urge participation. However, those who advised were sincere, but those who listened were indifferent. Although the staff of the competent authorities and the heads of various sections have been working hard, posting notices and trying to resist, and the good and weak are complying outwardly but resisting passively, no one has reported for work despite repeated setting of work dates. Hasty action will inevitably lead to incidents. The actual effect of road administration will not be achieved, and the hidden dangers of security have been laid, which is not a blessing for the region. In this situation, not only is progress hopeless, but even stagnation is worrying. We respectfully present the crux of the matter to the director in detail: (1) This county is adjacent to Shanghai, and most of the villagers work in Shanghai in addition to farming. Most of the river and road construction is contracted by outsiders, so it is particularly difficult to promote direct labor recruitment. (2) The cost of living in this county is increasing daily. The people are struggling for food and clothing, and even if they are hired, they want to choose jobs with higher wages. If labor is forcibly recruited, no one will respond. (3) The people of this county generally believe that those who have already built roads enjoy the benefits, while those who continue to build roads increase their labor burden. The methods before and after seem unfair. This opinion is particularly prevalent, making it difficult to start labor recruitment. The above three reasons show that the labor recruitment system is difficult to implement suddenly in this county. Reading the late Premier's theory of caring for the people's livelihood, we cannot bear to impose heavy burdens on our people through urgent levies. We have also found that this county has been collecting taxes for road construction since 1921, and now it has been nearly ten years. Many north-south and east-west county roads and township branch roads have been completed, and the convenience of transportation is superior to other counties. For future road construction matters, we should adopt a gradual approach, both for clearing old debts and promoting road administration, which will benefit both the economy and public opinion. If we follow the department's regulations and add multiple lanes to the existing county roads, forcing uniform labor recruitment at the same time, regardless of whether it causes local resentment, the funds for all bridges, culverts, land prices, and cinder have not been raised, and there will be nothing to cope with. The unfinished dirt roads (this county is a water town, and there are a total of 53 large and small bridges on the north-south county roads. If they cannot be planned and carried out at the same time, then what is built will be dirt roads that are disconnected by water) will not be practical. After a while, they will still be overgrown with weeds, wasting the arable land of farmers. We are deeply afraid that the policy of benefiting the people will instead harm them. Our county has built county roads over the years, exhausting local public and private financial resources and enthusiastically participating, which is earlier than other counties. Only because the debt is deep, we should act according to our ability. Therefore, at the last general meeting, two methods were decided: (1) From the annual income collected by the county's transportation office, after repaying the loan and interest, we will consider the economic situation and start construction on Chengyue Road within the five routes that have been submitted, and build the other routes in stages. (2) The county's labor recruitment for road construction plans to use the extra mu tax, which is higher than other counties, as a substitute payment, temporarily using the hiring system and postponing the labor recruitment system. The above two resolutions have been discussed for a long time, and everyone agreed. We dare to present them clearly and earnestly request the director to consider the special circumstances of the region and approve flexible handling. We will be extremely grateful. Respectfully presented to Sun, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department."</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Significance of Inspecting Huabian (Lace) Commerce <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Instructs Shanghai Merchant Groups to Explain</p>
<p>The Shanghai National General Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Special Municipality Merchant Groups Reorganization Committee jointly received an order from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce: "Regarding the instruction: It has been found that the association previously received a telegram from the Shanghai Special Municipality Lace Embroidery Trade Association Preparatory Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Preparatory Committee) opposing the draft inspection rules for lace inspection proposed by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the Inspection Bureau), claiming that it hinders foreign trade and requesting its abolition. The telegram requested a detailed consideration of the situation. We have ordered the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to review and reply and have informed you in advance. Now, according to the bureau's reply, the inspection of lace was requested by Shanghai Dafeng Lace Store, Pudong Qinchang Lace Factory, Yantai Zhongxing Factory, Wenzhou Chentongli Store, Wuxi Hengchang Lace Factory, Changshu Yuanshun Company, Xiaoshan Jinglun Factory, Longhua Company, Rugao Dafeng Public Factory, Ningbo Lousantai Factory, Shanghai Dada Company, Pudong Dacheng Factory, Shaoxing Zhenda Lace Net Factory, etc. on November 18 of last year, who signed and stamped their names, detailing the various malpractices in the lace business and requesting inspection to rectify them and promote trade. Therefore, the bureau specifically requested approval from your department to set up a place to prepare for inspection. The merchants did not consider the facts and claimed that the bureau fabricated merchant intentions and deceived your department, which is a deliberate slander. This should be clarified. The lace director, Chen Jinduan, and the deputy director, Tao Yumen, were not acquainted with the director of the bureau. Upon hearing that they were studying art and had expertise, and that they had been engaged in the lace business for many years and had experience, the bureau asked people to obtain their consent and requested their appointment. However, the merchants did not consider the facts and claimed that the bureau placed private individuals, which is also a deliberate slander. This should be clarified. The bureau's income and expenditure, in addition to detailed records in the budget, final accounts, and various books that can be audited, also has a report submitted to your department for verification and distributed to the merchants of various commodities inspected for confirmation. The bureau's finances have long been public and there are no malpractices. The merchants did not consider the facts and claimed that the bureau was seeking private gain, which is also a deliberate slander. This should be clarified. The director of the Shanghai bureau always worried about the estrangement between officials and merchants and sought cooperation between officials and merchants in everything. Therefore, after drafting the lace inspection rules, the bureau sent letters to the merchants in the industry to solicit opinions, hoping to gather wisdom and benefit from each other. However, the merchants did not sincerely discuss the rules with the bureau but declared and opposed them in the newspaper. What is the intention? We do not understand. However, the merchants did not consider the facts and arbitrarily slandered the bureau for fabricating merchant intentions, deceiving your department, employing private individuals to seek private gain, and seem to be responsible for morality and criminal law. Regarding the reasons for the order, in addition to the items in the lace inspection rules pointed out by the merchants, we will sign and present them separately for your review. We should first report the various points pointed out in the merchants' telegram for your review." According to this, the verification is the actual situation. The bureau previously received a request from Shanghai Dafeng Lace Store and more than ten other companies to inspect lace for rectification, and reported it to your department for approval. Later, according to the Preparatory Committee's telegram of opposition, the bureau sent the original submission to your department for verification. It was confirmed that the representatives of the merchants signed and stamped their names, and there was no fraud. The Preparatory Committee's Lin Zhangrong, Li Jiansan, Cheng Wenming, etc. did not consider the facts and falsely claimed that the bureau fabricated merchant intentions, which is inappropriate. As for the inferiority of exported lace goods, the German Bremen Chamber of Commerce's report, forwarded by the embassy in Germany in January of this year, stated that the quality of lace was poor and 40% to 50% had to be rejected, which could not be accepted. This is clear evidence. Moreover, German Yantai companies have used technicians to inspect exported lace. Japan also has places to inspect exported silk fabrics. The Preparatory Committee said that lace embroidery goods are the same as silk fabrics and cannot establish an exchange, which is not a valid argument. As for the inspection rules, the bureau first sent the draft to the merchants in the industry to study in order to seek official-merchant cooperation, originally to solicit opinions and achieve the best results. However, the merchants did not contact the bureau and immediately declared and opposed it in the newspaper, which is even more inappropriate. Considering that the merchants' knowledge is insufficient, we will refrain from further investigation. However, the association is a leading organization in the business community and should correct such publicity based on justice. You should be informed of this order."</p>

<p>▲ The Pinghu Citizens Living in Shanghai Telegraph to Request Approval</p>

<p>▲ Xie Liben Fails to Marry</p>
<p>▲ Mu Shijiang Incites a Crowd to Assault</p>
<p>Wei Sheng, currently residing in a thatched cottage in Tanjia Ferry, north of Caojiadu, Shanghai West. He has an uncle named Xie Haijun, who is also twenty-nine years old and works at the Xinsheng Company in Tanjia Ferry. The uncle and nephew often visit each other. Liben has been in Shanghai for many years and is usually quite frugal, so he has saved a little money. Because he is lonely and drifting, he intends to marry and start a family. At the beginning of last month, a friend acted as matchmaker and arranged for Liben to marry a woman surnamed Chen, who lives near his residence and is from the same hometown. Liben's desire for a wife is like waiting for clouds in a severe drought. Not long after the arrangement was made, he started preparing to choose a date for the wedding. Unexpectedly, the woman is only 29 years old and has a beautiful appearance, and many people covet her. Recently, Mu Shijiang, an Anhui native who runs a "tiger stove" (a type of stove for boiling water) at No. 21 Chongxin Workshop in Tanjia Ferry, developed an ambiguous relationship with the woman due to covetousness, and the temperature of their relationship reached a boiling point. Now, suddenly learning that the woman has been betrothed to Xie and will soon be married, it became a love triangle. A storm arose in the sea of jealousy, and Mu developed a determination to harm Xie so that he could seize the woman for himself. Xie invited two burly men, one holding a sharp single-edged sword, one holding a large firewood knife, and one holding a large iron rod. The three of them went to Xie's place. Without asking questions, they surrounded Xie Liben and attacked him with knives and sticks, engaging in a bloody battle. Xie immediately fell to the ground after being stabbed, covered in blood and flesh, and unconscious. Seeing that their purpose had been achieved, the two burly men fled with their knives and sticks. Patrol Chief Hu Lizhong of the 6th District Police Station on Guangfu Road and Extra Patrol Chief Wu of the Shenghe Long Oil Factory rushed to the scene after learning of the incident. Unexpectedly, the assailant Mu Shijiang stepped forward and confessed, "I was the one who harmed Xie, and I am fully responsible," etc. Seeing that the injured person was on the verge of death, Patrol Chief Hu and others immediately arrested him and took him back to the 6th District Police Station, and the injured person was taken by car to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. According to the doctor's examination, Xie Liben had two knife wounds on his head, two on his left upper arm, and the wounds were very deep with profuse bleeding. Four fingers of his left hand were cut off, leaving only the thumb, and half of the back of his hand was cut off. He also suffered one knife wound each on the left and right sides, for a total of seven knife wounds. His breath was weak, and his condition was very dangerous, and his life was feared. Xie Haijun, Liben's uncle, then filed a case, requesting a thorough investigation. After separate interrogations by the District Chief Duan, Xie Haijun, the plaintiff, stated, "I am 29 years old, from Anhui, and currently work at Xinsheng Company. Today, my nephew Liben was slashed by Mu. I don't know the reason. However, my nephew's injuries are dangerous, so please punish him severely," etc. The assailant Mu Shijiang stated, "I am 20 years old, from Anhui, and currently run a 'tiger stove' at No. 21 Chongxin Workshop. I harmed Xie because I had a grudge against him," etc. After obtaining the confessions, District Chief Duan ordered the assailant to be temporarily detained and sent to the court today to be dealt with according to the law.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the French Concession police raided an organization specializing in trafficking women and children on Ningxing Street yesterday morning (the 19th), arresting two bandits and rescuing four young women. According to their confession, the gang has organizations all over China and mostly lures women from the northern and central provinces to Shanghai, then transfers them to Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Nanjing to be sold as prostitutes or maids. Their methods of luring are mostly to entice ignorant and uneducated young women with words about how high wages are and how comfortable life is in Shanghai and other places. Once they fall into the trap, it is difficult to escape. Most of these women are textile workers, and their parents are mostly poor and unable to conduct large-scale investigations, so few cases have been solved. Recently, the number of reports of missing young women in the French Concession has suddenly increased, and the police have stepped up their investigation, leading to the raid. When the detectives entered the house, the four women were all hiding in a corner of a room upstairs. At first, when they saw many people, they suspected that they were being taken to a southern port and were extremely panicked. When they were told that they were police officers who had come to rescue them and take them home, they were overjoyed beyond description. It is now known that the organization that was raided is the gang's headquarters in Shanghai, used exclusively for confining deceived young women awaiting transfer.</p>

<p>▲ Ten Irrelevant People Released</p>
<p>▲ The Remaining Twelve People Remanded in Custody</p>
<p>Xia Sheng, the son of Wang Shunjin, the owner of the Tongshunxing Machine Factory at No. 533 Gongping Road, was kidnapped by bandits on the night of the 25th of last month and hidden at No. 644 Xinzha Road. Later, he was rescued by detectives from the Huishan Police Station, who also apprehended fourteen male and female criminals for interrogation. This was previously reported. The police station learned that Wang Maoyi, Wang Yudong, Liu Guilin, Shao Hongqing, Chi Futian, Zhang Jinfa, Xia Zisheng, Wang Ren, and other eleven male and female suspects arrested by the 3rd Branch of the 5th District of Zhabei were also accomplices in the case. They were specially taken back to the police station, and it was also found that these people had also committed robberies of Li Arong at No. 50 McKinley Road and of a certain nunnery on Huishan Road. The fourteen people previously arrested, except for Zhou Shen, who had died of smallpox, and the eleven people brought from Zhabei, were all sent to the Special District Local Court the day before yesterday, where Judge Feng interrogated them. The police lawyer stated that Yang Sihu, Chen Lidian, Ji Sha, Sun Chenghuai, Wang Maozheng, Shao Huasheng, Yin Kaifa, Sun Jitai, and the women Sun Yuan and Jia Jiang, etc., had no evidence of committing a crime and requested that the charges be withdrawn. Judge Feng approved the request and ordered the ten men and women to be released first. The police lawyer continued, "There are still two defendants, Wang Laowu and Wang Jiajiu, who committed a kidnapping case in the Chinese territory. The kidnapped person was surnamed Chen, and the local police station sent detectives to the case and requested their transfer." After Judge Feng reviewed the official documents, he ordered the two Wangs to be handed over to the detectives of the 3rd Branch of the 5th District to be taken back for interrogation. Therefore, only twelve male and female defendants, including Jia Kuizhi, remained. Wang Shunjin then described the kidnapping of his son, saying that five bandits broke into his house on the night of March 25. Three bandits held pistols and first demanded the keys, opened the box, and robbed him of more than one hundred yuan in silver, as well as a gold ring and a gold watch. Then they snatched his three-year-old son and subsequently sent five letters demanding a ransom of two thousand yuan, as well as a dozen gold rings and gold watches. Because he had no funds, he ignored them. Wang also identified Li Zhaozhen as one of the defendants, saying that he was at the scene at the time, but he could not identify the others. Gu Fulian, Wang's relative, testified that Xia Sheng was in his arms at the time when he was snatched away by the second bandit who broke in. He could not recognize the bandit's face because he was frightened. When questioned, Jia Kuizhi, Li Zhaozhen, Zhou Guanqing, Wang Maoyi, Zhang Yudong, and Liu Guilin all admitted to kidnapping the child and said that Jia Da, who was at large, was the mastermind. The remaining Chen Lilan, Shao Hongqing, Chi Futian, Zhang Jinfa, Xia Zisheng, and Wang Ren all denied the charges and hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend them. Judge Feng ordered the twelve people to be detained separately and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<p>▲ Possibly Drugs to Lure Children</p>
<p>▲ Two Trafficked Boys and Girls Rescued</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 6:00 AM, Chen Shaoting, an investigator from the Society for the Relief of Women and Children, boarded the Taikoo Company's Xiamen steamer Zhejiang as it was about to set sail to investigate whether there were any traffickers luring women and children for export. He found a woman, about forty years old, in the cabin with a boy and a girl, and her behavior was suspicious. He questioned her, and the woman stated that her name was Ding Dai, 48 years old, from Quanzhou, Xiamen. She claimed that the boy she was carrying was purchased in Shanghai for 44 silver dollars, and the girl was purchased for 136 silver dollars, and that she did not lure them. When questioned, the boy stated that his name was Cai Bao, 7 years old, and he did not know anything else. The girl stated that her name was Zhang Asan, 14 years old, from Songjiang. The police then found two small white pills, similar in shape to camphor pills, beside the woman. The woman claimed that they were round candies that children liked to eat. However, the police chief did not believe her and carefully examined the two round pills. They did not appear to be made of sugar. Whether they were drugs to lure children needed to be determined by a doctor. They were all ordered to be sent to the Local Court for disposal.</p>

<p>▲ Two Bandits Arrested</p>
<p>Chai Wenhua, who lives in Hongzhen, reported to the 3rd Branch of the 5th District Public Security Bureau a month ago that his six-year-old son had been kidnapped by bandits and requested an investigation. There was no news until recently, when the bandits Wang Jiajiu and Wang Laowu, who were hiding in the concession, were arrested. They confessed that Chai Wenhua's child was kidnapped by Wang Si and taken to Xiamen by Han Liuzi to be sold to a Mr. Chen for 170 yuan. Wang Laowu received 80 yuan, Wang Si received 70 yuan, and Wang Jiajiu received 6 yuan.</p>

They robbed them of three silver dollars and a pair of gold rings. After the store clerk called for help, one of the bandits was arrested by Police No. 9 of the 2nd Branch of the 4th District Public Security Bureau and taken to the station. He confessed that his name was Xu Xuedao, from Jiangbei, and admitted to committing the robbery with the bandit who was at large. The station chief ordered him to be sent to the Judicial Section for review.</p>

<p>▲ Expresses Dissatisfaction with the Abduction of the Bride</p>
<p>▲ Attempt to Reconcile Fails</p>
<p>Zhang Ruie, a young woman from Tongzhou, residing at No. 6 Wangjiazhai, Gaolang Bridge, is currently a female worker in a textile factory. In the past, her father, Zhang Jiushou, arranged her marriage to Shen Jinshan, the son of Shen Maolian, from the same hometown. Because of the abduction of the bride that occurred in the Qianzhai residence, Zhang Ruie is very dissatisfied and has hired lawyer Yin Shengwu to file a lawsuit in the Shanghai Local Court, requesting the dissolution of the marriage contract. Yesterday, Judge Yang Keqian opened the court to interrogate the case. The plaintiff, Zhang Ruie, stated, "I am 16 years old, from Tongzhou. (Question) Who is Shen Jinshan to you? (Answer) I didn't know anything about him until they came to abduct me, and then I understood. Shen Jinshan is my father's betrothed fiancé, but I don't want to, so I filed a lawsuit," etc. The judge said, "You are only sixteen years old this year, which is not legal. You must have a legal representative. Your father is your guardian. Are you willing or not?" (Answer) "I don't want to. You said that my two brothers are robbers, but I am young and don't understand the reasons, so please take care of me." (Question) "When was the bride abducted?" (Answer) "It was on the first day of the third lunar month this year. I escaped back on the same day." The defendant, Shen Jinshan, stated, "I am 20 years old, from Tongzhou, living at No. 18, 21 Jian Tou, Gaolang Bridge, and I make a living by working. (Question) If she doesn't want to marry you, what can you do? (Answer) I must have her, but I did not abduct the bride. Because her father and daughter had an argument at home that day, my sister-in-law went to mediate. Unexpectedly, her father, Zhang Jiushou, called thirty or forty people from the Tilam Bridge area and snatched her back. (Question) If you say you did not abduct the bride, why did so many people snatch her back?" The defendant was speechless. "How much betrothal gift did you give?" (Answer) "Seventy yuan, arranged by Tang Lide as the matchmaker," etc. The judge ordered Zhang Jiushou, a related person, to come to court to testify, "I am 47 years old. My daughter Ruie was betrothed to the defendant when she was eleven years old, and the betrothal gift was only thirty yuan. (Question) What are your intentions now? (Answer) I have to ask my daughter. (Question) Was the bride abducted? (Answer) Yes, she was abducted," etc. Shen Maolian, a related person, stated, "I am 53 years old, also from Tongzhou. The defendant, Shen Jinshan, is my son." The rest of his statement was the same as the defendant's. The judge attempted to reconcile the two parties in court, but both parties refused to comply. Therefore, he invited Prosecutor Zhu to the court to express his opinion, which was roughly that the plaintiff's request was without sufficient reason and should be rejected. The judge then announced that the debate was over and that the verdict would be announced on the 21st of this month, and then adjourned the court.</p>

<p>▲ Unwilling for Family to Interfere</p>
<p>▲ Files Lawsuit to Prevent</p>
<p>Yuan Ziyin from Funing, Jiangbei, age 34, and Xu Xiaomei (i.e., Gu Xu’s, age 18), a woman from Yancheng, have fallen in love and are cohabitating at the third house in Xinglong Lane, Gaolang Bridge. However, the woman's mother, Xu You’s, is vehemently opposed because the daughter had already been betrothed to Xu Xiaosi. Therefore, she has repeatedly intervened, intending to take Xiaomei back. Unexpectedly, Xiaomei wishes to spend her days with Gu Ziyin, who is older. Xu Xiaomei and Gu Ziyin have jointly retained lawyer Song Shixiang and filed a petition with the Shanghai District Court requesting a judgment ordering the defendant (i.e., Xu You’s) and others not to interfere. The petition states roughly that in November of the 17th year of the Republic [1928], matchmaker Yang Shousong arranged for Xiaomei to be betrothed to Ziyin, and 80 yuan in silver was given as bride price. It was originally intended to hold the wedding last autumn, but Xu You's excessive demands led to the postponement of the wedding date. Fortunately, Xiaomei, understanding the greater good, came to Ziyin's home this spring and hastily married. What's done is done, so they request that their union be fulfilled and that the defendants be ordered not to interfere. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Keqian opened the court for trial. Gu Ziyin testified that he is 34 years old and makes a modest living. (Asked) Have you married Xiaomei? (Answered) I have married her. I got engaged to Xiaomei on the 24th day of the 11th month of the year before last. At that time, I sent 80 yuan in silver as bride price, as well as four packages of fruit and other gifts. Because my mother-in-law Xu You’s demanded an additional 200 yuan in bride price, I was unable to raise the money in time, so I missed the wedding date. On the fourth day of the second month of this year, Xiaomei ran to my house, and we hastily married that evening. Gu Xu’s (i.e., Xiaomei) testified that she is 18 years old. She was betrothed to Gu Ziyin the year before last. Later, because her mother demanded an excessive bride price, the Gu family was unable to marry her. Unexpectedly, on the third day of the first month of this year, her mother and elder brother summoned an old woman to their home to assess her character, intending for her to become someone's concubine. Hearing this, she refused and, out of desperation, left on the afternoon of the third day of the second month to meet with Gu Ziyin. They spent the night in a hotel, and the next day (i.e., the fourth day) they found a house and began cohabitating with Gu. On the night of entering the house, they lit candles and burned incense together in the pavilion room upstairs, bowing to Heaven and Earth, thus consummating their marriage. As for the husband's age, although he is older, he is very honest and not like those slick and oily types, so she is very satisfied. Moreover, this marriage was arranged by her mother, and so on. The defendant Xu You’s testified that Xiaomei is her daughter, and she does not know Gu Ziyin, so how could she have betrothed her to him? Her daughter Xiaomei was betrothed to Xu Xiaosi as a wife on the sixth day of the eleventh month of last year by matchmakers Shousong, You Fubi, and Zhu Zhaoqing. (Asked) Why were there three matchmakers? (Answered) This is our hometown custom, to have three matchmakers and six witnesses. Now Xu Xiaosi works as a baker in a flatbread shop in Nanmen, Wuxi. When the engagement was set, three tables of wine were prepared, and the Xu family sent 24 yuan in silver, along with a gold bracelet and two gold rings. When the Xu family demands the person, how will she deal with it? Please investigate. Witness Yang Shousong testified that he is 65 years old, from Yancheng. The defendant is his wife's younger sister. He works as a road laborer and has never been a matchmaker. His sister-in-law Xiaomei was betrothed to Xu Xiaosi by You Xiaosan, Zhu Zhaoqing, and Yang You’s. On the day of the engagement, the woman's family prepared one table of wine, and so on. The judge, having heard the testimonies, ordered both parties to go outside and reconcile, and also instructed that the court still needed to investigate the truth in order to make a ruling. Thereupon, the court was adjourned.</p>

Although she is betrothed, she has not yet married. Hidden deep within the household, her romantic feelings blossomed early. She was seduced by the local rogue Zhu Ronggou, resulting in an illicit affair. Rumors spread far and wide. Zhu Ronggou and Si, realizing the situation was dire, chartered a boat together on the sixth of this month and came to Shanghai, hiding in the Fifteen Rooms area of ​​Pudong, thinking that the remote location would safely conceal "A Jiao" [a beautiful woman]. Who knew that the secret would be leaked and discovered by her cousin Wu Changqing, who, yesterday morning, coordinated with Zhou Haibo to rush there. They were both apprehended and handed over to the police. They were detained by the Third District and transferred to the District Court for investigation.</p>

<p>Zhang Liukouzi, a tenant residing at No. 1 Yucai Lane, Minde Road, Zhabei, and his wife, Zhang Pan’s, have been married for several years, but their feelings for each other are exceptionally weak. Because the couple’s intentions are different, the husband is conservative, while the wife is progressive. They share the same bed but have different dreams, each with their own thoughts. The day before yesterday, they argued and fought, wrestling each other to the district office to file a lawsuit. After the chief of the office earnestly advised them, they were both released. Unexpectedly, the couple started arguing again midway. Zhang became enraged and severely beat his wife, striking her foot with a stick to "teach her not to run away." She was knocked to the ground, and Zhang left immediately. The Sixth District Party Office sent her to Qianyi Hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the original police station, which apprehended Zhang Liukouzi. Yesterday, he was transferred to the District Court for trial.</p>

<p>▲ His Aunt Intends to Jump into the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Lin Zishan, a resident of Tongzhou, previously, needing funds, invited relatives and friends to form an informal savings group, but it disappeared invisibly midstream. Lin's aunt, Zhu Wang’s, was also a member, resulting in losses. She had demanded the return of the savings she had paid to Lin. Lin, who works as a rickshaw puller, was unable to repay the debt and has not repaid a single penny. The day before yesterday, the two met again on the banks of the Suzhou River. Zhu Wang’s said to Lin, "If you don't return the funds I paid, I will accompany you on a trip with Wu Zixu [commit suicide]." Hearing her words, Lin not only did not try to appease her with gentle words but actually dragged her to jump into the river together. Onlookers on the riverbank were many, fearing they would truly drown, and rushed to rescue them. At that time, the police officer from Post No. 1660 nearby had heard the alarm and arrived, taking the man and woman to the General Police Station to report to the police chief for investigation. This is truly a novel twist in debt collection.</p>

<p>Zhang Yingming, a dentist from Ningbo whose practice is located at No. 110 North Zhejiang Road, rented the spare room upstairs to Zeng Lin’s, a woman from Jiangbei. Zhu Lin’s set up an opium den, secretly selling opium. The Vehicle Affairs Department of the General Police Station discovered this, secretly raided the place, and apprehended both women and opium users Zeng Asi, Ji Guangui, etc., along with the opium paraphernalia. At that time, Zhang Yingming was also in his own room indulging in smoking opium, so he was arrested as well. Later, he was released on bail for 100 yuan. The day before yesterday morning, the police station sent Zeng Lin’s and the others to the Special District Court. Zhang also surrendered himself. After questioning by Judge Sun, Zeng Lin’s was sentenced to three months in prison and fined ten yuan. Zhu Lin’s was sentenced to three months and ten days in prison and fined ten yuan, with a two-year suspended sentence.

<p>The Chinese and Western detectives of the Huishan Police Station successively apprehended twelve robbers from Jiangbei, including Song Zhenlou (aka Song Xiaoliuzi), and transferred them to the Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. As previously reported in this newspaper, Chief Detective Lu Liankui and Chinese Detective Su Changsheng, who are handling the case, have now discovered that Song and the other robbers had previously held weapons and conspired to kidnap Zhang Zukang on Wuchang Road for ransom, and had robbed the property of considerable value from several households, including Wang Jinsheng at No. 740 Dixuewei Road, Sun Hu’s, a woman at No. 598 Zhaofeng Road, Zhu Chengyu at No. 505 Dongtang Lane, Yin Cai Kang at No. 2142 Haining Road, and a certain person surnamed at No. 523 Wuzhou Road, as well as having shot and killed Zheng Meitang at No. 175 Jiujiang Road.

<p>▲ Resulting in Loss of Life</p>
<p>Wang Xunzu, an old man from Anhui, previously hired a lawyer to represent him and filed a lawsuit in the French Concession court, claiming that the plaintiff’s daughter-in-law, Wang Wang’s, was employed as a servant at the home of Wang Senchang, who runs a lumber business.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>In the first month of the lunar year, she suddenly took poison.</p>
<p>After deliberation, the judge instructed for further investigation. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that after the deceased, Wang Wang’s, took poison at 8:00 AM, the master should have immediately called a doctor for treatment, which could have saved her life. Unexpectedly, the master not only failed to call a doctor for treatment but waited until 12:00 PM to report to the police station and send her to the hospital. Although the defendant is not guilty of forcing her to death, the crime of abandonment is inescapable and requested investigation. The defendant, represented by lawyer Jin Yu, argued that the defendant hired Wang’s as a servant for only a short time before she committed suicide. The reason for this was probably due to resentment within her own family, leading to suicide. Knowing that she was being coerced by the master, she could have resigned from her job. There was no reason to commit suicide. The plaintiff's accusation is baseless and purely extortion. He requested a clear investigation and dismissal of the case. Judge Zhu instructed both parties that the arguments were concluded and that a verdict would be announced after deliberation.</p>

<p>Yuan Haishan, a detective from the Shanghai Special Municipality Public Bureau, previously accused Qian, a monk, in the French Concession court of conspiring to kidnap Yang Qinxue, a wealthy merchant in the city, and requested that he be transferred to the court for investigation. Qian vehemently denied the accusation and was instructed to have the detective bring the actual criminal to court for questioning and further investigation. The day before yesterday, he was summoned again. The detective brought the actual criminals, Shen Guigui and Li Ajin, to the court. Shen and Li both testified that although they smoked opium in Monk Qian's home, Qian was not actually aware of the kidnapping. Chinese and Western officials ruled that the evidence was insufficient and dismissed the case.</p>

<p>Zhou Wenji and others, carpenters, previously jointly hired a lawyer to represent them and filed a lawsuit in the French Concession court, claiming that the foreman, Wang Shunchang, who was contracted to build a house for the Chen family, owed the plaintiffs a significant amount of money for goods. Unable to repay, he abandoned the project and fled. Later, the plaintiffs and the Indian contractor, Fang, held a meeting, agreeing that whoever continued to complete the project would be responsible for repaying Wang's debts. Everyone agreed at the time, but unexpectedly, after the Indian contractor continued to complete the project, he ignored the plaintiffs' outstanding debts. Therefore, they filed a lawsuit requesting repayment. The defendant was also represented by a lawyer and presented witnesses to testify. After deliberation, the judge issued a verdict on the appointed date. The two parties were summoned to the court, and Judge Gong ruled that since the defendant had acknowledged the debt previously, he should bear full responsibility and repay the plaintiffs a total of 4,5358 yuan, with the court costs to be borne by the defendant.</p>

However, he claimed that he had already returned the stolen money to the plaintiff and requested leniency. The judge sentenced Qu to three weeks in prison as a warning.</p>

He rushed forward to rescue him, but Wang had already died, and there was no way to bring him back to life. The roommate ordered tenant Wang Zhizhen to report to the Tanziwan Police Station in the Fourth District. Patrol Officer Shi Zhaoyu went to investigate and reported back to headquarters, awaiting report to the court for coroner's examination.</p>

<p>The Hongdafu, a sandboat from Laiyang, Shandong, was leased from the Shandong Renfeng Company in February for a term of two years, with a contract stipulating that all repairs during the lease period would be the responsibility of the lessee, the Gongji Company. This was its third trip from Shanghai to Laiyang, carrying goods such as native cloth and yarn remnants. The boat sailed to Qingkou when a hurricane erupted on the sea, and the rudder was broken by the waves, rendering it unable to steer. It drifted with the wind and waves for a day and a night before running aground near Dalian. The bow of the ship was damaged, and eight crew members were thrown overboard when it ran aground. The ship sounded the gong for help, but no ships passed by. It was spotted by pirates, who boarded the ship and robbed it, taking all the cotton yarn and other goods. They also shot and wounded the shipowner, surnamed Yang. Fortunately, a Japanese coal ship passed by and saw the situation, sending the ship's crew to Dalian. The ship remained aground on the beach. Yesterday, four members of the crew arrived in Shanghai by boat to report to the company. It is said that the ship was carrying goods worth 40,000 yuan. Whether the ship can be repaired will depend on whether it can be towed out of danger and the condition of the hull can be inspected.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Public Security Bureau received a letter yesterday from the Bureau of Public Works stating that the construction and repair of public and private buildings in the city should, according to regulations, be reported to this Bureau before work begins, so that this Bureau can issue construction or repair miscellaneous licenses to ensure compliance. This Bureau will spare no effort to crack down on any unauthorized construction, projects exceeding the scope of the license, or projects that do not conform to the reported plans and are intended to deceive. However, the city is vast and the projects are complex, making it difficult for the Bureau's inspection personnel to be comprehensive. If any of your district offices encounter any of the above-mentioned illegal situations that have not been detected by this Bureau, it is hoped that you will provide assistance and report the illegal situation to your Bureau at any time, which will then be forwarded to this Bureau for verification. In cases where the situation is urgent and requires immediate action, district offices may directly notify the competent department of this Bureau (i.e., the Fourth Department) by telephone to coordinate the handling. Before notifying this Bureau, it is especially hoped that the district offices will not directly impose penalties or revoke the licenses they have issued in order to avoid ambiguity. It is requested that you investigate and inform all subordinates to comply accordingly.</p>

<p>Qian Ajin, a woman from Shenjia Bridge, Yuepu Township, Baoyi County, was betrothed to Qian Xizhang, a local villager, at the age of four, but had not yet married. Last year, after Ajin's grandmother died, Qian Xizhang went to offer condolences, and a conflict arose at the memorial service, leading to disagreements. Qian Ajin then filed a lawsuit for divorce with the Baoshan County government. Yesterday afternoon, Hearing Officer Zhang Wei opened the court for a joint hearing. Qian Ajin testified in court that she is 24 years old. She was betrothed to Qian Xizhang at the age of four by her parents. Now she does not want to marry him because her fiancé does not engage in proper business and has no fields or houses. Therefore, she requests a divorce. Hearing Officer Zhang then advised her, saying that if she divorces, she may not be able to find such a good husband again, and would she not regret it? However, the woman insisted on divorcing and said she would not regret it. Qian Xizhang testified that he is 22 years old, a carpenter. He was engaged to Ajin at the age of two by his parents, with Zhao Huanzhang and others as matchmakers. The betrothal gift was 12 yuan in silver. At that time, Ajin was four years old. Later, he was lent an additional 70 yuan. He has not committed any crimes such as theft and does not want a divorce. After Zhang advised them repeatedly, the two parties argued fiercely. Therefore, Hearing Officer Zhang ruled that Ajin should repay Qian Xizhang 70 yuan in silver and that they be allowed to divorce. If either party is dissatisfied, they may file an appeal within 20 days of receiving the judgment. He then ordered the plaintiffs and defendants to leave together.</p>

<p>Madam Mao, the mother of Ningbo merchant Yuan Shanbao, was diligent and thrifty in managing the household and was well-known in her village. She passed away suddenly last month at the age of 72. Yesterday, a memorial service was held at the Vatican Palace, and Wang Yiting was invited to inscribe the memorial tablet. Those from military, police, business, and academic circles who attended to offer condolences, such as Wang Boling, Chen Xizeng, Huang Jinrong, and Du Yuesheng, numbered five or six hundred. There were over a thousand mourning banners and couplets. The plain carriages and white horses were extremely solemn.</p>

<p>It is said that the houses in the Caishi Street and Dongxin Bridge area of ​​the French Concession are the property of Chinese people and are managed by the Loxley &amp; Co. In June of the year before last, the company had planned to rebuild the houses in the area, but after the request of all the tenants, a three-year grace period was granted, stipulating that demolition would begin in June of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], with a letter from the company as proof. Now the company states that it has transferred the property rights to the Xielong Company, which has retained lawyer Chen Tingrui to notify the tenants that they must demolish the houses by the end of May, starting from April 1st, and that all tenants must move out within the deadline. Upon hearing this news, all the tenants were greatly alarmed and held a general meeting yesterday at the Baoxing Lane Commercial Association, and elected Zhu Shengmao as chairman to report on the situation. The tenants then proposed six measures to deal with the situation and sent letters to various agencies and organizations in this city, unanimously advocating for justice and providing assistance.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Public Concession implemented fare increases for all tram and trolleybus lines. Mr. Baughurst, the general manager of the tram company, had the revised fare schedule and notices posted in the trams so that the public would know. The French Tram Company also posted these notices, leading to the mistaken belief that the French trams were also increasing fares. In reality, only the trams in the Public Concession are increasing fares.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, a man appearing to be a construction worker, around 30 years old, was wandering around the Rihui Bridge area. Yang Chongyu, a road police officer at the station, saw that he looked suspicious and approached him for questioning. At that moment, a car drove by. Officer Yang pulled the construction worker out of the way, but unintentionally used too much force, causing the construction worker to lose his balance and fall to the ground, resulting in the car hitting his head and causing him to bleed profusely. At that time, many construction workers carrying poles saw that their colleague, Jiang Dechun, was injured and bleeding heavily, and thought that he had been beaten by the road police. Therefore, a crowd of over a hundred construction workers gathered and made things difficult for the police officer. The misunderstanding was cleared up after station personnel and patrol officers persuaded them. The injured construction worker, Jiang Dechun, and road police officer Yang Chongyu were both sent to the police station for questioning, and Jiang Dechun was sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Labor Statistics Work and Plans (Continued) <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>▲ Shanghai Special Municipality Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>(I) (J) Labor agreements and labor agreement statistics have only developed in recent years. In 1926, the International Labour Office convened labor statistics experts from various countries for the Third Conference to discuss compilation methods, striving for international uniformity to facilitate comparison. Labor agreement statistics are used to study the employment conditions and work systems of groups, with the aim of standardizing employment conditions, eliminating labor-management disputes and monopolies, and balancing the negotiating power of both labor and management. The unit of statistics is a labor agreement, and its main items include the nature of the contracting parties, the scope of application, the agreed items, events, validity period, arbitration method, business classification, the number of related factories, and the number of workers. The number of agreements in effect at the beginning of the year, the number of renewed agreements, the number of terminated agreements, and the number of agreements in effect at the end of the year. As for the provisions in the agreement regarding wages, working hours, and individual employment conditions, they should be separately classified into wage statistics, etc. (K) Strikes and lockouts. A strike is when workers, in order to demand conditions or express opinions, combine as a group and temporarily stop working in order to promote the recognition or awareness of the other party. A lockout is when the management, in order to demand conditions, temporarily closes factories in order to promote the recognition or awareness of the other party. According to the results of the International Labour Statistics Experts Conference, strikes and lockouts can be combined into one category called labor disputes. Labor disputes can be said to be a serious manifestation of conflicts between labor and management, and the social loss is great. If we want to study and resolve camp-based disputes, we naturally need to start with compiling statistics. The important items that should be studied in the statistics include the number of strikes and lockouts, the industry, the nationality of the management, cause analysis, result analysis, mediation methods, the number of related factories, the number of labor participants, the number of extended days, the number of working days lost, and the amount of wages lost. Go-slows are considered strikes in the laws of various countries and are also included in this type of statistics. (L) Labor disputes. Any labor-management conflict in which labor and management are negotiating and one party continues to work is called a labor dispute. In terms of the degree of conflict, strikes and lockouts are of course the most serious, but in terms of the number of cases that occur, then disputes should be promoted. Disputes can be said to be the initial stage of disputes. If disputes are not resolved properly, they will lead to strikes and lockouts. However, if disputes do not reach the level of strikes and lockouts, society will not pay much attention to this, and it is not easy to investigate. Therefore, very few countries compile this type of statistics, unless the collection of materials is particularly convenient. However, during labor disputes, it cannot be said that there is no considerable loss in terms of material costs and mental stress, and disputes are the fuse for disputes. Therefore, in order to show where the crux of labor disputes lies and to prevent problems before they occur, if there is not much difficulty in collecting materials, it is best to compile statistics. The content is the same as labor strikes and lockouts. The scope of labor statistics, of course, is not limited to the above-mentioned items, but the most important statistics are roughly like this. However, it must be known that the field of labor statistics expands with the degree of industrialization and the development of labor undertakings. For example, when labor was not developed in the past, there were naturally no statistics on labor agreements, etc. Therefore, to what extent will labor problems expand in the future, and the field of labor statistics will also develop to that extent. It seems that there is no need to study this here.</p>
<p>▲ Past Work Since the winter of 1927, this bureau has begun to conduct labor statistics, with the aim of observing and planning to solve the city's labor problems through statistical exploration. At the beginning of the project, everything was in the planning stage. From January 1928, three types of statistics, namely wage index, strike statistics, and labor dispute statistics, were first implemented on a trial basis to meet the urgent needs of administrative reference. In the spring of 1929, three books, "Trial Compilation of Wage Index of Shanghai Special Municipality", "Strike Statistics Report of Shanghai Special Municipality", and "Labor Dispute Statistics Report of Shanghai Special Municipality", were published and distributed by Shanghai Datong Bookstore on Fuzhou Road. The process and results of each statistic are detailed in a special booklet, so there is no need to talk about it here. At the same time, we are also engaged in compiling a series of labor statistics books to introduce labor statistics knowledge, hoping that various places can gradually organize them. The list of books that have been published and are in printing is as follows: Compilation Method of Cost of Living Index (Published by Shanghai Commercial Press) Unemployment Statistics Method (ibid.) Compilation Method of Industrial Labor Dispute Statistics (ibid.) Worker Accident Statistics Method (In printing) Overview of the American Housing Problem (ibid.) Household Livelihood Survey Method (ibid.) Labor Agreement Statistics Method (ibid.) In the second half of 1928, statistical personnel were added, and it was planned to conduct surveys on the living standards of Shanghai workers, cost of living index, retail price survey, and unemployment statistics. Among them, unemployment statistics are of a experimental nature. It was held in September and took three months to complete the survey. The results have been published in the eighth issue of the Bureau's Social Monthly, which is also published by Shanghai Datong Bookstore. In 1929, the statistics on wages, strikes, lockouts, and labor disputes were continued, and the survey on the cost of living of workers' families and the retail price survey were started. The cost of living survey adopts the standard sampling method, selecting 400 workers' families for investigation, with a period of one year. Staff are sent to each family every day to replace or guide bookkeeping, with each person managing about 20 families. Strict inspection is carried out every month and calculated at any time. By March 1930, the investigation part can be completely concluded. After that, it is just the work of calculation and compilation. The retail price survey has been conducted by the bureau since January 1929. In addition to the market prices of meat and vegetable dishes, the survey is conducted once a week. Rice and grain are surveyed three times a month, and the rest of the items are surveyed once a month. The goods surveyed are as detailed as possible, and most of them are based on the results of the cost of living survey and are consumed daily by workers. In addition to the small vegetable markets, more than 150 merchants were surveyed in the city. The customers of these retail stores are mostly workers. In the autumn of 1928, because we had fully obtained the belief and understanding of the above-mentioned retail stores, we planned to track down the retail prices from 1926 to the present. Since the beginning of the process, the results have been satisfactory and will be completed soon. The results will be published at the same time as the cost of living index in the future. In addition, the wage survey that we started in 1928 is the actual income of workers, and it is surveyed once a month. First, it is divided according to industry, and then according to male, female, and child workers. In order to understand the detailed wage rate situation in each industry, we planned a wage rate survey from June 1929 and completed the survey in November. The compilation method is to first divide according to industry, and then according to occupation and male, female, and child workers. We are currently in the process of dividing occupations and calculating, and hope to be able to compile and publish it in May 1930. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e165">Talking About Hail <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qian</p>
<p>A few days ago, a guest came from Shanghai and said that he encountered hail in the boat, and told me about the shape of the hail, saying that the volume was different, and it was divided into three types. The larger ones were like chicken eggs, the second ones were like walnuts, and the smallest ones were like lotus seeds. Some were split in half, like the bottom of a radish. The spiral pattern on the top was very obvious, with five, six, or seven turns. Two or three turns were transparent. In the middle, there was a center, and among the large and small ones, there were different points, or they were round and complete, or they were extremely incomplete, like flaws. It was suspected that several hailstones merged to form this shape. Because of this guest's words, it caused a debate among the people in the same seat. I thought that empty talk was useless, so it was better to turn the book. So we found the following items together.</p>
<p>Ciyuan: "Hail is rain ice. When there is thunder and rain, the clouds are shocked by electricity and enter the ice and snow line boundary in the high sky, condensing into ice points and snowflakes, and then rotating and uniting to form ice blocks, which fall together with rain." According to this statement, the guest's words are reliable. The spiral pattern with five, six, or seven turns also. The two turns are transparent also. Is it not enough to prove that the theory of ice point snowflakes rotating and uniting is scientific? And the theory that several hailstones merge to form one is also somewhat similar.</p>
<p>Da Dai Li Zhu says: "Yang energy is in the rain, and it is warm like the sun. Yin energy is thin and does not enter, and it fights and becomes hail. Therefore, the Chunqiu Guliang Zhuan says: Hail is a symbol of yin threatening yang." Pi Ya says: "Yin wraps yang to become hail." Li Yueling Zhu says: "Yang is like rain, and yin rises to threaten it, condensing into hail. Liu Xiang said: "When the sun is strong, the rainwater is warm and hot, and the yin energy threatens it and does not enter, then it turns into hail. Therefore, boiling soup is in a closed container, and when it is soaked in sweet spring, it becomes ice. This is its test." The above four statements are the same in meaning as the previous one, but the words and phrases used in ancient and modern times are very different.</p>
<p>However, there is a mysterious saying in Zuo Zhuan: "There is no hail when the sage is on the throne. Even if there is, it is not a disaster." Fortunately, the blind teacher is talking about the origin of hail, not the cause of hail formation. It does not seem to hinder the previous few statements from competing for a place. We should just treat him as nonsense.</p>
<p>In addition, there are other names that must be known, and the stories that run through the other names must also be understood. Yunhui Bu says: "The hail in Tao and Min is called white rain, also called hard head rain." In the seventeenth year of Shaoxing in the Song Dynasty, it rained hail in Lin'an, and the roof tiles of the Taixue were broken. The Xuegong tabooed hail, so they said hard rain. This hard rain can be greatly studied. It is probably always because of believing in nonsense. It is not that the Xuegong is illuminated by the aura of the Supreme Sage and First Teacher and avoids it, but it is because he is afraid of advocating peace talks and falsely accusing Yue Fei. There is no doubt that he is Qin Hui, the prime minister who paid tribute to the Jin Dynasty and called himself a minister.</p>
<p>As for Liu Xiang's boiling soup in a closed container and soaking it in sweet spring to become ice, it is quite similar to the current ice-making and freezing. Or was the ice-making and freezing already invented in China at that time? A smile.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Two Miracles in Taixing <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yan</p>
<p>▲ Wen Tianxiang Zi Taixing has a simple and honest folk customs, so the people are polite. And the Confucian Temple in the city is very spacious. The structure is also exquisite. Solemn and magnificent. Golden and resplendent. The four screen doors in front of the Minglun Hall are made of Phoebe zhennan. The door is carved with an absolutely large Kui character. (Made in the style of Hejin) More than one foot square. The brushwork is vigorous. Exceptionally delicate. It was written by Wen Tianxiang. According to legend, when Wenshan was writing the ghost character, his wrist strength gradually became insufficient. He kicked with his left foot and used his right wrist to borrow the strength of his foot, so he went up smoothly. Therefore, the ghost character sentence is more vigorous. Although it has been thousands of years, it is still intact and undamaged. It is really a Mo Bao.</p>
<p>▲ Wu Mu's hand-planted flower is forty miles away from Taixing. The town has a Yue Wang Temple. It covers a large area. It is the best place for pavilions, terraces, flowers and trees. There is a magnolia tree in the courtyard. Three people embrace it. It is only one foot high. And the branches and leaves cover an area of one mu. It does not wither in the severe winter. It was planted by Wu Mu himself in the past. It is protected by carved railings. Emerald green and lush. Outside the temple, there are iron-cast statues of Qin Hui and his wife. When the merchants and residents of the town have bad business, they often like to go to Qin Hui's wife, Wang, and stroke her breasts with both hands to ensure that business will be booming the next day. The language is very absurd. The matter is also tasteless. However, it can also be seen that Wu Mu's loyalty is deeply moving.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Talking About Drunkenness <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Ruoqi</p>
<p>The play "Drunkenness" is a play that is often practiced by those who know how to sing Huashan. However, the movements are heavy, and the singing is all in Siping tune. It is not easy to excel without a high and low voice. There are even fewer amateur performers who practice this play. I am very fond of Hu Su, and I especially like to play "Guifei Drunk". Two years ago, I hired a teacher to learn this play. A month later, I barely succeeded. Every time I want to practice, there are very few people who are in tune with me, so I can't satisfy my desire to play the piano. Recently, the Beikai and Dachina phonograph companies have two new records of "Drunkenness". I quickly bought them and listened to them. I can learn the tune and play the piano at the same time. My wish has been fulfilled. What could be happier? Now I will describe the highlights of the two records separately.</p>
<p>▲ Xun Huisheng's record has a long Ah character tune at the beginning of the Daoban Huilong. This record cuts it off probably because of the length. The sentence "Hede Nu Zhuanjingjing" is sung in Yuanban. The last Jing character is composed of the Gongpu Liuliu Chisan characters. The Liu character is on the board, and the Chi character is on the eye. These three characters seem ordinary, but they are very pleasant to hear on the strings. The sentence "Niangniang Youhua Lai Wenni" has the Pu Sishang Fan Chi Shang Gong Chi Shang Wu Shang Wu Liu Fan Liu Wu Shang Liu slowly and lowly sung. It is intoxicating to hear.</p>
<p>▲ Jiang Junjia's record. The two records that Junjia recorded have complete lyrics from beginning to end. There is also the Ah character tune. However, it is also a fast three-beat. The opera Gao Pei Erzhe is slightly different from what Huisheng sang. Huisheng wins with gentleness, charm, and sweetness, while this wins with clarity, vigor, and fluency. Each has its own advantages. The three characters "Leng Qing Qing" in the ending of "Qu Ye" are high and inexhaustible, which shows his skill. After listening to it, I still seem to have a lingering taste, left between my teeth and lips.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Anecdotes of Yang Liaogong <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yanjin</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, when Yang Liaogong was the Guangwen of Baoshan, he had a teacher-student relationship with my father. However, he ignored the formalities. When he took office, he did not bring servants. He had poet friends Shen Long and Wang Chi, who followed the school. It was originally a cold yamen. He often visited with my father. His colleagues or people in the county often invited him to banquets, but he refused. Every day, he went to the western suburbs of the city to visit and play. When it was time for lunch, he wanted to stay for a meal. Gong said that there was no need for dishes. He only needed ten eggs, half a catty of white sugar, a bowl of boiled water, and a pot of Longjing tea. When my father went to the school, he entertained him with a can of braised beef, ten pancakes, and half a catty of Wen wine. My father Dong took charge of the Western School. He opened a room in the western corner of the school and named it Qu Xuan. He asked Gong to write. After Gong wrote the plaque, he also wrote a record for it. The record said: "Prince built a room in the west of the Western School of the city. It is titled Qu Xuan. Some say, this is not Qu's Xuan. Why is it called Qu Xuan? I say, what is Qu's to have and what is not Qu's to have in all things in the world? Why be so narrow-minded between Qu's to have and not Qu's to have? Moreover, in the west of this room, there are lotus ditches in summer and lotus ditches in autumn. Why can't any of them be Xuanqu? What does Qu Xuan have to do with Qu? Who is Qu Xuan to Qu?" After saying that, some people called it Xuanqu. I then used Xuanqu. Yang Liaogong wrote. This record was hung in the room for many years. The reporter still saw and remembered it when he studied at the school. Unexpectedly, the headmaster of the school was a non-person. The tables and chairs were almost destroyed. It is not known where the plaque has gone. Every time I go back to my hometown, I am heartbroken. Looking back at Yang Gong, I feel lost.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Born Vegetarian <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Qian</p>
<p>My friend Liang Jun Kuizhao is a diligent and courageous young man. He studied at Zhijiang University in Hangzhou. The opportunity to return to Shanghai is rare. Last night, I went to Mr. He's house on Sichuan Road. Liang Jun was there. We met unexpectedly. We were very happy. The host was very affectionate and insisted on keeping us for dinner. So we did not leave.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang's nature is very peculiar. He is different from ordinary people. He has not been able to taste meat since he was born. If he smells it, he will vomit. He cannot eat anything other than the first and last two tastes of salty, sour, bitter, spicy, and sweet. He does not eat things with strange tastes. He does not eat chives, onions, or garlic. He only uses green vegetables and tofu to help him eat every day. And the amount of rice he eats is not weak. Therefore, on this evening, the host specially prepared vegetarian dishes to entertain him.</p>
<p>What's more, Mr. Liang does not smoke or drink alcohol. He does not like what is called the nature of food and sex. He said, "I have already studied physiology. I know the structure of the human body, regardless of gender. It's just skin and bones. Why should I pay attention to it?" So Mr. He earnestly said, "There are already more than a hundred kinds of vegetarian food for the mouth and stomach. Frying, stir-frying, stewing, and braising, what taste cannot rival meat? The human body is just a stinky skin bag. Although the food is delicious, what is excreted is the same. Why should we kill more creatures to satisfy our hunger?" (Mr. He is also a strong advocate of vegetarianism). He then turned to Mr. Liang and said, "Your previous life must have been a high monk. But because your merits and virtues are not complete and your sins are not cleansed, the God of Darkness has punished you to come here to experience more vicissitudes. You should encourage yourself."</p>
<p>Not long after the meal, Mr. Liang had to take the night train to Beijing to participate in the grand ceremony of the National Boy Scout General Review. So he left first.</p>

<p>After that, I sent Wan Hua a book on Boston's history. This book was specially bound with a specially made book cover. It was printed with the words "Presented to Mr. Mei". Finally, the most famous members of our community performed to help the rest of the performers. There were two singers, one who played and sang, and one who performed magic. They were all excellent. The guide then showed us the souvenirs in each room. There were many books. Wan presented a painting, a pair of yarn lanterns, and a reply. He said that he was very happy to be welcomed by the people of your country during this trip to the United States. He was especially honored to be promoted and rewarded by the predecessors in the same industry. Lan Fang's artistic skills are still shallow, and I hope that you will give me guidance. Finally, he said that socialists have a saying that workers all over the world should unite. I hope that artists all over the world will unite today. I came here to absorb some new cultures from the New World and contribute to my motherland after I return home. Therefore, I must ask you for more advice. So that this trip is not in vain. I also hope that you will travel to the East together in the future, so that the people of our country can broaden their horizons, and so that Lan Fang can take this opportunity to do his best as a host. That night was extremely enjoyable for both the host and the guests. (March 14)</p>
<p>A few days ago, an old lady watched Wan's play twelve times. It was performed for three weeks and she never saw Wan. She was afraid of bothering Wan. She came to see him yesterday. When I told her that there was still one week left, she said that she wanted to watch it twelve more times but could not. She will come to watch it every day from now on.</p>
<p>There is a Greek newspaper here that is read by literary experts. It is also very popular in Europe. There is a long article that praises Wan Hua very much, but I could not understand it in detail because it is in Greek. I will have someone translate it when I have time.</p>
<p>Recently, the discussions in major venues have mostly been about Wan, and they all say that he is really a great artist and must be seen, etc. For example, Philadelphia has already sent a telegram, and several art conferences are preparing to welcome him.</p>
<p>Dr. Dewey and others invited him to dinner. There were dozens of university professors at the table. Dr. Dewey said that everyone was very happy to see Eastern culture in the United States this time. Mr. Mei's ability to bridge the gap between the two countries can be said to be extremely great.</p>
<p>Consul General Xiong said that Mr. Mei's visit to the United States this time has had an extraordinary impact on Eastern culture and an extraordinary impact on the future relationship between China and the United States. It is a good opportunity to travel to various cities to promote it.</p>
<p>Today's Herald Tribune has an essay that says that Mr. Mei is young and beautiful. This visit to the United States has been very successful. I am also very satisfied with it. The first performance was full, which was expected. However, the seats were still the same after four weeks of performance, which shows the extent to which Americans welcome Chinese opera. Chinese opera has a very high structure and is not easy to learn. However, there is now this opportunity to see this good play and see this complete art. Isn't it a very pleasant thing? It also said that Mr. Mei's performance is not only good, but his personality is also very noble. (March 17)</p>

<p>Although yesterday was a Sunday, several small banks, including money shops and Chinese merchants who do not observe Sundays, still transferred large sums of foreign currency on behalf of their customers. This is because the use of tea is currently very brisk, and it cannot be abandoned for even a day. Yesterday, it was estimated that 200,000 yuan in banknotes and silver dollars were shipped to Hangzhou, 300,000 yuan continued to be shipped to Hankou, 150,000 yuan was still shipped to Anhui, 100,000 yuan went to Fujian, and 150,000 yuan was shipped inland. However, no shipments to Guangdong were reported, presumably because sales there have slackened.</p>

<p>The long-term deposit loans that matured this time were arranged on the previous day and settled as usual yesterday, seemingly without any other problems. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, Ningbo banks suddenly asked Shanghai banks to transfer more than 300,000 yuan in six-point spot loans. It is said that these loans were absorbed by the Western goods and pawnshop industries, with interest rates of 8.5 and 5 taels, respectively. Local banks in this city, also recognizing these interest rates as favorable, were willing to follow suit with several tens of thousands of yuan, resulting in a total of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. There were also three-point term loans. In total, it is said that the financial sector made temporary long-term loans of 1.1 to 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Securities: The Sixth-Year Consolidated Bonds for Disbanded Soldiers Rose the Most Last Week <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>▲ Trading Volume of 50 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Last week, the public bond market in this city's securities market saw sluggish spot trading, with only 148,600 yuan opened. Among them, the consolidation bonds for disbanded soldiers accounted for 70,700 yuan, customs duties 28,000 yuan, continued bonds (Da) 15,900 yuan, sixth-year consolidated bonds 11,000 yuan, rehabilitation bonds 8,000 yuan, continued bonds (Juan) and consolidation bonds for disbanded soldiers 5,000 yuan each, and seventh-year financial bonds several thousand yuan each. Futures were more active, and the market was very lively every day. Looking at the overall trading situation for the week, Wednesday was the most active, reaching over 1.33 million yuan. Monday and Friday were quiet, with only over 5.3 million yuan on Monday and over 5.9 million yuan on Friday. The remaining days were all above 8 million yuan, totaling 49,925,000 yuan. Among them, customs duties had a large trading volume every day, with a total weekly transaction of 17.79 million yuan, divided into 7.78 million yuan for the April term and 10.01 million yuan for the May term. The rehabilitation and sixth-year consolidated bonds also performed well, with the sixth-year consolidated bonds accounting for 2.7 million yuan for the April term and 5.555 million yuan for the May term. The rehabilitation bonds accounted for 3.53 million yuan for the April term and 3.385 million yuan for the May term. The consolidation bonds for disbanded soldiers also far outperformed the previous period, with 1.87 million yuan for the April term and 4.47 million yuan for the May term. The continued bonds (Juan) were also clear, with 3.06 million yuan for the April term and 2.02 million yuan for the May term. The continued two-five bonds were still clear, with 1.04 million yuan for the April term and 775,000 yuan for the May term. The 96 public bonds accounted for 900,000 yuan for the April term and 1,025,000 yuan for the May term. The consolidation bonds for disbanded soldiers accounted for 395,000 yuan for the April term and 1,035,000 yuan for the May term. The seven-year financial bonds were very clear, with 40,000 yuan for the April term and 30,000 yuan for the May term. Financial bonds accounted for only 100,500 yuan. As for the price fluctuations of various bonds, the consolidation bonds for disbanded soldiers and the sixth-year consolidated bonds had the largest ups and downs. The sixth-year consolidated bonds rose sharply in the first two days of the week due to rumors in the market that funds might be allocated to prepare for a lottery draw, which greatly excited the market and invigorated buying interest. The price rose sharply, rising by about one yuan on Monday and jumping more than three yuan on Tuesday. On Wednesday, it initially continued to rise rapidly, rising by as much as six or seven yuan compared to the previous week. However, as the price rose significantly in the market, more people seized the opportunity to sell, and the sentiment slightly calmed down, the buying situation also turned sluggish, and the price hovered downwards. However, the result was still an increase of 3.7 to 3.8 yuan compared to the previous week. The consolidation bonds for disbanded soldiers rose significantly on Tuesday and Wednesday due to the limited circulation of spot goods in the market and continued active investment. The demand and supply sides were still very different, rising by three yuan and three jiao compared to the previous Saturday. Financial and 96 bonds had minimal fluctuations due to infrequent trading. Other bonds followed the ups and downs of the sixth-year consolidated bonds for disbanded soldiers, with a peaceful trend. As a result, the consolidation bonds for disbanded soldiers were stable, and the seventh-year continued two-five bonds rose by six or seven jiao, while other good bonds rose by one or two yuan. The statistics of the highest, lowest, and fluctuations of various bond prices last week are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>▲ Zhabei: Yesterday, the source of inland rice was scarce, and sales in the market were even more sluggish. Although the arrival of rice from Hexia was rare, the existing stock was not weak. Ordinary Northern White Japonica rice had mostly entered the pass at 20 yuan, and the middle and lower grades weakened by a few jiao. Transactions were sparse, and merchants were observing. With the sunny and hot weather, if the accumulated goods in the river are not sold early, they may change color. Therefore, merchants with goods held for a long time intend to sell them quickly, but it is difficult to fulfill their wishes due to the lack of customers. However, the price is gradually declining. Buyers of Bo Dao rice are also rare, and retail sales in this street are limited. Large-scale short-term sales are close to a few jiao. The source of Yang Du Jian rice is still dry, and the outgoing path is also weak. The market is fixed, and Bai Yuan rice is sluggish and continues to weaken, with an unusually sluggish situation.</p>
<p>▲ South Shanghai: The arrival of boats from Hexia is not strong, estimated to be only a few. Sales of Changzhou and Wuxi Northern Japonica rice are flat, and the market is sluggish. The arrival and sales of Su Tong Ji Japonica rice are both stagnant, and the trend is gradually becoming sluggish. The above prices are high and fixed, but the quality is soft, with a difference of about one jiao per batch. The outgoing path of southern Qing Ding and other Bo Dao and early rice is uneven, and sales are very slack. Only a few street merchants are picking and purchasing, and the market is slightly modified. There are some arrivals of foreign pointed rice, but only southern goods, and northern goods are extremely rare. Buying sentiment is average, and large-scale transactions are stable. Currently, the situation of Xian rice has no glory or disgrace to speak of. General sales are still connected, and retail sales are slightly active, with no price fluctuations. Yin Yuan rice is not selling, and transactions are sluggish and sparse, showing a weakening trend of a few jiao.</p>

<p>▲ Chen Silk Gradually Running Out... Prices Increasing</p>
<p>Last week, the silk market of foreign firms and Chinese firms in this city lacked the possibility of continued prosperity. This was because the end of last week coincided with Christmas, and the customs was closed. There were only four market days throughout the week. In addition, exchange rates fluctuated constantly, and overseas silk weaving factories focused on rayon for thin silk, resulting in a reduction in the sales of natural silk. The import of raw silk to New York from China and Japan increased sharply, and the stock of silk was relatively thick. The demand for raw silk in Lyon was increasingly scarce. As Chinese merchants ran out of raw materials and the remaining silk was limited, prices increased. Silk factories will stop reeling in the middle of next month, and silk sales are unlikely to be smooth. Last week, a total of over 400 bales of term and spot silk were traded. The export of Chinese silk was over 2,000 bales, mostly shipped to American territories. Due to exchange rate factors, the price of Chinese silk overseas tended to be flat and weak. The market price of Chinese silk in European and American markets at the end of last week is listed below (New York price per pound, unit: gold yuan; Lyon price per kilo, unit: francs):</p>

<p>▲ Japanese Sugar Market Slightly Declining</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and there were no telegrams from the production area sugar market. The guild market was flat. Initially, the atmosphere of Dutch sugar No. 24 raw sugar and white sugar was quite strong, and the sellers called for a price of 7 taels and 3 qian and 5 fen. However, there were no buyers, and a certain merchant lowered the price to 7 taels and 3 qian, willing to sell. The market atmosphere suddenly flattened, and buyers became more hesitant, offering even lower prices. After a stalemate, there were slight transactions at 7 taels, 2 qian and 7 and a half fen. Finely ground white sugar was 7 taels and 3 qian and 5 fen, and No. 20 medium sugar white sugar was 7 taels and 5 fen, and the market was still quite strong. Transactions of Japanese sugar were also sparse, and the market slightly declined. N Mark was 7 taels and 7 qian, TY Mark was 7 taels and 6 qian, PY Mark was 7 taels, 7 qian and 7 and a half fen, KT Mark was 7 taels, 6 qian, 1 fen and a half li, and YRO Mark was 7 taels and 3 qian. The market conditions were all flat and weak.</p>

<h3 id="e180">The Leading Lady Problem in Cyrano de Bergerac · Hui · Yin <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Fudan Drama Society decided last year to perform the romantic drama Cyrano de Bergerac, which had once caused a sensation in the European and American theater circles. Later, because the director of the society, Mr. Hong Shen, fell ill, this great script was finally unable to be brought to the Chinese stage. This is of course a regret for our comrades who care about the drama movement.</p>
<p>The theater scene in 1930 was considered very active. The Art Drama Society, the Modern Society, etc., were all very hardworking groups. In particular, the drama groups of various schools, since the Modern Society advocated the school drama movement, have become more vigorous in their activities.</p>
<p>The Fudan Drama Society was originally considered to be very prestigious among the universities, and of course it also began to work at this critical juncture. As a result, the sound of preparing for the rehearsal of Cyrano de Bergerac spread throughout the campus again.</p>
<p>Cyrano de Bergerac, as far as we know, requires a lot of actors to play. The male protagonist Cyrano de Bergerac is played by Mr. Hong Shen himself, of course there is no problem. But the female lead Roxane, because of various problems, took a lot of deliberation.</p>
<p>The decision made last semester was to call on Ms. Jin Zhongyu, who had won praise for playing the parasitic grass, to take on the role. But this year, because Ms. Jin is about to graduate and needs to prepare her graduation thesis, she can no longer have a lot of free time to rehearse this heavy Roxane.</p>
<p>I remember there was a message on the school's bulletin board saying that many well-known ladies had been transferred from various places this semester. Of course, Mr. Hong Shen paid close attention to it. So, through the introduction of Ms. Jin, Ms. Yu Jianbi, who had transferred from Zhongda University, was persuaded by Mr. Hong after repeated requests, and agreed to play the role of Roxane.</p>
<p>Ms. Yu is a freshman who just came to Fudan this semester. She originally studied politics at Central University. Later, because Jinling, which had been troubled by a group of wealthy officials and dignitaries, could not keep her fragrant tracks, she resolutely transferred to Fudan, the highest institution of higher learning in the southeast. Anyone who sees Ms. Yu's healthy and beautiful physique, expressive posture, and the naturally melancholy temptation in her speech, will immediately know that it would be best to have her play Roxane in Cyrano de Bergerac.</p>
<p>But, unfortunately, I recently heard that Ms. Yu is not going to play this role anymore. It is said that because Ms. Yu is a freshman, she is very busy with her studies, and she is not very familiar with everything in the school, so she does not want to play this lead role, which feels too burdensome. However, which Miss is Mr. Hong Shen planning to call on to take on this role after all? I heard that he spent a lot of effort when he begged Ms. Yu to take on this role before.</p>
<p>So, Cyrano de Bergerac is prepared to be staged, but the problem of the leading lady has not been decided yet.</p>
<h3 id="e181">The Life of Women Among Overseas Chinese in Nanyang · Y · S <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>I have been wandering in British Malaya since I was a child, so I know a lot about the customs, habits and daily life of Nanyang. Now I will first introduce the life of Chinese women in Nanyang to the Chinese people.</p>
<p>"Status and Occupation" Anyone who has been to Nanyang cannot but believe that Overseas Chinese in Nanyang are full of conservatism. For two or three hundred years, Chinese have lived in the wild land of savage natives, without being assimilated. This is something to be grateful for, but it cannot but be said that it is a gift of their conservatism. Although the trend of the times is evolving day by day, the conservative nature of the Overseas Chinese is still "the same as before." The Chinese women there are still full of the remnants of the old ethics in their minds, and regard the "three obediences and four virtues" of the "Women's Instructions in the Boudoir" as the "golden rule." They can only "marry a pig and follow a pig, marry a dog and follow a dog," and everything must be dependent on the man's thoughts. Therefore, men are happy to support them as toys. They live a comfortable and happy life, and they don't care about status or women's rights.</p>
<p>In recent years, the revolutionary climax in China has gradually affected the Overseas Chinese society in Nanyang. Therefore, the emergence of women's liberation associations and other groups has been heard from time to time. However, in reality, they are still inevitably despised and insulted by men. As for the reason, it is nothing more than the inability to be economically independent. Overseas Chinese women in British Malaya are not prepared in terms of skills and knowledge, so how can their economic status reach the point of independence? In recent years, the singing and dancing stars in China have been welcomed by the local Overseas Chinese after they arrived in Nanyang, and they have become popular for a while. Therefore, all schools have to hire singing and dancing teachers. Therefore, the professional outlet for Overseas Chinese women in Nanyang now is mostly to be singing and dancing teachers, except for a few who are teachers in girls' schools. As for those "Nyonyas" (native women) who have received foreign education, they are only clerks in foreign firms or post and telegraph bureaus. Some poor Overseas Chinese women are mostly hired as servants.</p>
<p>"Clothing" Nanyang is close to the equator, so it is summer all year round. The daily temperature is about 60 to 70 degrees Celsius. Therefore, their clothing is not particular and tends to be simple Malay attire. Moreover, many Overseas Chinese there also marry Malay women as wives, and the resulting natives cannot but be affected by the environment and customs. Ordinary women (referring to native-born Chinese women) mostly wear Malay attire, a red and green apron with rich patterns - Sarong - wrapped around the lower body and extending to the chest, down to the ankles, about four feet long. In addition to the "bodice" on the upper body, they also wear a thin gauze long shirt, the length of which hangs down to the ankles. They wear gold-embroidered slippers barefoot, and the bun is combed on the forehead, with five or six gold or silver hairpins inserted. At first glance, it really makes people suspect that it is ancient Chinese costume. Women dressed like this are called "Nyonyas" by Overseas Chinese. In fact, "Nyonya" is a Malay word, meaning "madam" or "girl", like the English Lady has the same meaning. As for those women who are not natives, they mostly wear the inherent Chinese dress. In recent years, due to the influence of domestic films, these "Nyonyas" have gradually removed their Malay attire and put on Shanghai-style fashions.</p>
<p>"Habits and Language" Because of living with different ethnic groups for a long time, they are inevitably assimilated to some extent. Overseas Chinese women in British Malaya are like people who have been deeply poisoned. They like betel nut, wrapping betel nut and lime "Gambier" in bamboo leaves and sending it into their mouths, chewing carefully, and what they spit out is a liquid that looks like blood. What they exhale is a foul-smelling sour taste. Those who are deeply addicted almost cannot leave their mouths at any time. Therefore, a pair of white teeth will have to become as black and ugly as the teeth of people who smoke opium.</p>
<p>When eating, they mostly use their hands instead of chopsticks, and the utensils for serving rice are mostly plates and dishes, because this way they can feel convenient.</p>
<p>As for the language they speak, it is very complicated, but it is very common to be able to speak at least three languages. Some can even speak five or six languages, such as Malay, English, Hakka, Hokkien, Cantonese, etc. Malay and Hokkien are almost the languages ​​they use daily. Chinese Mandarin, if they have not received Chinese education, can be said to be as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.</p>
<p>What I have talked about above is just a glimpse of the general situation of the life of Overseas Chinese women in British Malaya. It is inevitable that there will be omissions, but I hope that you readers can pay attention to their lives, whether it is beneficial or harmful to the future of our Overseas Chinese.</p>

<p>In modern times, people from various European countries have developed an interesting interest in China. Therefore, as long as he writes about the story of China, he can become famous. Especially Western women living in China, they are more likely to have the leisure to write poetry, literature, anecdotes, etc., than capitalist men and women. In the past, Ms. Hack's biography of Du Fu and her works, and Ms. Sisi's volume of Chinese literary research, have all enjoyed great fame in the United States and Britain. Recently, a book by Ms. Alice Tisdale Hobart about the history of a Chinese merchant's romance was published in London, which aroused the interest of Westerners in China. This manuscript is called Pidgin Cargo, which is a description of the romance of a Chinese silk merchant leader. However, many records contain satirical elements. Her husband is an American merchant residing in China, so she spent fifteen years patiently describing it. When the Nanjing Revolution and the fierce battle with Sun Chuanfang broke out two years ago, unfortunately, it caused her fifteen years of hard work to be lost. However, her Chinese servant must have seen the hostess's careful writing over the past fifteen years and knew that it was something of great value, so he desperately rescued the manuscript for her. Now, because of going through such a difficult time, it has aroused people's enthusiastic attention when it was first published in London. (Changxi)</p>
