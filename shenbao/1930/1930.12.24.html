<p>今日世界各大問題所以陷於無辦法之困境者非眞無辦法也有良好之辦法而皆此推彼諉不肯首先實行以爲世界倡蓋所謂良好辦法其初必先稍有犧牲或須出甚大之力或冐若干之險然而人皆不肯先自犧牲而但責望人之犧牲人皆不肯先自出力與冒險而但責望人之出力與冒險如是則已先失協力互助之本意此所以雖有良好主張而終未見有實現之一日也今觀近兩日消息世界人心或有漸趨覺悟之機試舉兩事證之</p>
<p>一爲挽救銀賤問題報載歐芬信托公司之報告謂四方諸國如不欲陷東方於更深之苦境則須先除去目光短淺之國家偏狹主義國際聯盟會之金代表團亦言今謀現狀之改良不必侈談利人主義吾人扶助東方友人即所以扶助自已蓋阻止銀價之低落即所以發動可提高一般物價及增固國際商業之力量也世界各國果能由此着想以謀挽救銀賤則庶乎其近之矣</p>
<p>一爲實行軍縮問題美國羅脫及白脫羅白朗三人發表敦促美國實踐减軍宣言謂美國爲本國威信實有不得不减之必要食言而肥决非美國所應爲雖有種種阻礙爲維持前言計亦在所不顧使美國果能毅然决然不顧一切先自實行减軍則其他觀望之國自必無詞再緩</p>

<p>近來新發明的檢字法不下數十種無不力求簡易其中比較的爲一般人民所注意的是（一）用號碼檢字（二）以　順檢字記號碼阿拉伯數字雖也通用但一貨要認　筆畫一面又要應用數字記數用這　間接方法未免　煩且非習過四位以上的算數恐不能應用裕如至於講　順更覺爲難因爲不認識字的人正不知字從何筆寫起就是略諳筆順的也有因習慣不同先後不能一致所以用數字講筆順仍是不能爲檢字者設想又解析漢字的筆别實有（點）（横）（直）（撤）（曲）（筆勢彎圓的屬之）（折）（筆勢轉折成銳角的屬之）（鈞）（捺）（　九種近人應用筆數檢字往往將筆畫　意偷減或合併數單筆作一複筆尤覺漫無標準使人迷感鄙人以爲小學生和一般民家所需要的檢字法至少要（不用數字）（不顧筆順）可以不加思索便能着手檢查全數頭形檢字法的創作雖不敢自信是很完善的也許可說是（不學易檢）的儉字法現在將全數頭形檢字法的間單說明披露如下希望海内外同志賜以嚴　的指導和批評</p>
<p>（甲）全數把要檢查的字筆畫全部數清凡筆勢每一轉折即作一筆有一筆算一筆例如</p>
<p>（乙）作爲横折横鈎四筆（阡）作爲横折曲鈎直徽横直八筆</p>
<p>（　）作爲横直横直横曲鈎七筆（酉）作爲横直横直撇直横横九筆（退）作爲横直横横直　撇點點横直捺十三筆</p>
<p>（附注）（一）以筆勢每一轉折爲一筆的數法曾有數人主張但以九種筆勢爲漢字的基本筆勢則未曾有人確定</p>
<p>（二）至數時只照筆勢轉折一二三四數去就是不必　念筆别和筆順</p>
<p>（三）曾將中華書局出版的　字辭典任取其中三百餘字經過初上學的七八歲兒童四五人個别的全數後再行　覆無一錯誤者</p>
<p>（四）漢字全數最多費時不過十　鐘</p>

<p>江西一省近來迭受共匪之擾民不聯生不堪其苦是故蔣主席此次出巡時先赴九江南昌一帶一昨之日有客自九江回滬晤談之下蒙以匪亂聲中江西近况見告亟錄數則以實諸本談市况安謐九江南昌一帶近來謡言雖多市况尙佳且在過去數星期中確已起色不少城中軍隊充足共匪不敢來犯惟距離南昌三四百里之吉安曾爲匪徒佔領先後十四日刦掠焚燒無惡不作死傷人數竟有千人之多惟房屋之焚毁者爲數有限而敎會方面之損失亦屬不多</p>
<p>匪勢猖獗據南昌傳來之消息當共匪勢盛之時大舉來患佔領不少城市惟所到各地民衆損失尙不多而敎堂亦未見焚燬至於南昌之基督敎及羅馬敎敎堂受損不少即敎士之被擄者亦有多人其後曾有數人自匪窟中逃回得慶更生亦不幸中之大幸也</p>
<p>防備嚴密日來南昌城内防備頗嚴通衢要道設有鐵絲網及禦之物軍隊充足警察日夜梭巡可保無虞故英美兩國敎士前往他處避難者已先後回城九江及牯嶺亦頗安謐想必不致有意外發生也</p>
<p>物價一般如以南昌之物價而言則米價之低廉得未曾有目前每擔僅五元至八元約一百三十斤其他貨物大都高漲如食物皮貨衣料燃料等均較</p>

<p>綁匪開槍轟擊朱成章家住愚園路愚園新村對面一八九號洋房昨晨九時四十分左右朱乘自備之一零三四零號汽車外出由車夫土阿毛駕駛車中除主僕外尙有朱女潤珠朱妻之看護鄧女士及汽車夫下手吳林生茶役蔣來桃等一共六人朱旣上車即命阿毛開駛孰知前進未幾前面忽然有一汽車横阻去路車夫王阿毛在進退兩難中不知如何開罪對方子彈迎面飛來拍劈不已阿毛當時中彈倒於駕駛坐下</p>
<p>朱被綁女受傷子彈胡爲乎</p>
<p>來蓋發自綁匪之手爲綁架朱成章之先聲也烟硝方過車門頓開有兩匪一躍上車將朱從車廂中拽出架上匪車一轉瞬間疾駛而去朱女潤珠女士坐於其父之側此時身上已中流彈其同伴鄧女士亦遭槍傷至是一車六人四遭其殃所未遇難者祗與車夫同坐之吳蔣兩人耳然而驚惶過度亦已呆若木雞矣</p>

<p>新雪佛蘭</p>
<p>價格低減引起各界注意</p>
<p>各種改良不亞高價汽車</p>
<p>在一九三一年新車湧出的時候一個消息也許是大家要警驚異的這便是雪佛蘭新車的實然跌價新車是一年一度例有的事可是雪佛蘭的跌價却不免引起汽車界的相當興趣</p>
<p>事實是這樣的跑車（ROADSTER）原價買四百九十五元的新車僅四百七十五元運動跑車（SPORTROADSTER）由五百十五元减至四九五元標準雙門轎車（STANDARDCOACH）也由五六五元跌至五三五元其餘跌價的還有三種現在也不一一贅述不過雪佛蘭汽車公司創始於一九一一年而跑車的製造則始於一九一五年十五年來他的價格從來没有低到四百九十元以下今年的新車居然打破以往的紀錄怎不使人驚異</p>
<p>雪佛蘭爲什麽要跌價呢有人以爲一定是應付競爭可是事實上又大謬不然雪佛蘭在目前已有了它根深蒂固的地位每車低减二三十元對它的影響並不如理想那麽大公司裏傳出的可靠消息這次减價却因爲製造方面日趨改良所以用費也逐漸减輕成本一輕當然車價也隨这而跌雪佛蘭車素以服務人羣爲宗旨能使顧主少擔負一分錢自然要努力設法達到</p>
<p>十一月八號雪佛蘭因爲新車問世特地公開的舉行了一次展覽新車已造了不少顧主合意的馬上可以購車十九家分廠俱開工趕製因爲新車一聲宣布立刻會紛紛定貨來不及應付所以不如早些開工比較上可以從容些新車的式樣極爲美觀比去年又改良了許多行走時較前平穩使用年限也無形中增多不少</p>
<p>改良之中一件值得鄭重提出的便是没法不使機器中熱氣外騰在夏天的時候天氣已經很熱而駕車人因爲身體和機器相近更覺熱不可耐如今這種一安置夏天自然凉爽多了可是到了冬天需要這種熱氣時依然可以辦到理由是這種阻熱器是可以隨時裝卸的駕駛器也有改進掣動機是不受天氣影響的所以無論冷熱可以安全地使用</p>
<p>鋼絲輪美觀耐用車胎大小配上車身極爲適合車頭燈和車尾燈向來是人家不甚注意的如今新雪佛蘭一律鍍　以免生鏽鐄是一種不鏽金屬發明未久價值很貴新雪佛蘭車價低减而設備無一不可與高價車頡頏也可見犧牲的一斑了輪底加闊了二英寸使車内較前更覺舒適座位也加大這種完美設備當然爲大部顧客所竭誠歡迎安全設備尤其注意因爲本届世界道路協會開會議决案之中關於汽車肇禍曾通知各國汽車廠改良機件　　事雪佛蘭更加注意</p>

<p>一月三日開幕</p>
<p>一月五日星期一已定爲國際日一九三一年一月三日至十日在紐約大中央宮院舉行之第三十一次汽車展覽年會將欵待海外來賓至所擬定之節目極有價值而使諸蒞會者不虚此行也</p>
<p>五日之晨開國際日特組會議來賓藉機可與諸汽車工廠之巨子晤談關於製造汽車全球之分配與經營及最近汽車事業與轉運等種種問題亦將逐一討論是午海外來賓又可至大中央宮院參觀汽車展覽其中有三百六十所廠家之汽車及副産品陳列樣本在塲分發凡有問題時亦必詳加置答</p>
<p>一月六日星期二晚諸來賓咸被請爲康瑪度飯店年會公宴席之座上客届時海内汽車事業之領袖皆必相繼到會</p>
<p>下星期中凡有興趣者得成羣合隊前往地得羅及鄰近之汽車工廠參觀考察</p>
<p>紐約總部設在馬廟生路三百六十六號於展覽書開幕日（一月三日星期六）歡迎來賓前往註册並領展覽週入會之證章等云</p>
<p>車身的漆色採用特柯混合法光彩煥發比一九三零年式更覺壯觀華麗</p>
<p>散熱器是汽車裏重要機件之一機器每因行駛過久致發生過高熱度這全靠散熱器來解救一九三一年新車對此特别留心將散熱器冷水管加大可免汽缸受損喇叭的安置更來得别緻它正安設在左邊車燈的下面外觀美麗不俗使用極便　不佔地位除了這些以外新發明了一個避污機汽車在汚泥或雨後的街市上行駛往往弄得滿車汚　不堪盡成斑泥點現在新車安設此機汽車就可免遭此厄終年保持清潔這又是它的唯一特點</p>
<p>車身是名廠佛肖公司承造的目前汽車界的作風趨向於車身低平新車正合此旨所以望上去精雅可愛和高價車無分彼此車身繪製極切實用對於駕駛人尤有無限便利</p>
<p>再談到車的内部因爲增加了二寸輪底所以地位異常寬舒佈置方面有收灰器支臂架絲織坐墊玻璃全是採用不碎式可免危險這些雖說以往已有然而應用到四百九十元以下的汽車上還是第一次呢車内金屬一一鍍　開門時祇消輕輕一　無庸用多大氣力駕車人的座位也改良多多一切用具全都極有統系的安置着一望而知使用便利其餘如機件等等也都有相當貢獻</p>
<h3 id="c180">英製機器脚踏車之發達 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>具有小汽車之優點</p>
<p>已往之數年中英國汽車製造事業中有所謂（孩兒）車之出産者頗及一時之盛其初祇有一兩家之製造廠創造此種極小之汽車及至今日則著名之汽車廠亦均造此種式樣之汽車且其式樣咸極精美所謂小汽車者效率甚宏定價低廉而開支又甚省便總之此項小汽車之成功誠有如一般人猜想將打倒機器脚踏車於極點也</p>
<p>所幸此種猜想之恐懼不能現於事實購買機器脚踏車者爲數仍極衆多不列頗之製造廠亦出其全力以求機器脚踏車製造上之種種進步故其結果不僅其出品爲全世界之冠　於行銷方面亦佔得甚多之優越也此種情形脚踏車製造業亦有之</p>

<h3 id="c181">姊姊的殘骸吳曉田 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>草野社出版</p>
<p>這是最近出版界裏所發現的一本散文集作者湯增　君是長於寫詩的記得在一年之前我是讀了他底詩集一獨唱但在他那每一首抒情的詩篇裏都能引起我底内心的波動因爲詩歌所表現的眞的情緒是人生　　大底一面何况詩人更具有極形敏銳的感覺呢所以文藝界人常說以詩底筆法來寫散文這是最富有美的情趣但是（姊姊的殘骸）一集裏這等美底成分尤爲濃厚所以我們讀了更其易於感動眞不啻歌吟一首抒情的美的詩篇</p>
<p>新文藝在中國似乎呈顯着没落的表象尤其是在民國十九年的當兒我們祗要看國内的出版界所呈顯於讀書界的文藝書籍眞是寥落晨星其詩歌與散文兩種範疇差不多已没落於無聲無息即是各種刋物上間亦發表一些這類的文字但是它底力量却很小不能引起讀者特異的注意這實是很顯明的事實自湯君這本（姊姊的殘骸）問世以來却打破了文藝界的沉寂它似乎具有相當的力量因爲這本散文集突現讀者的眼前眞個是出乎人們意料之外的事不過在這集子内容的本質上確有問世的值價這血與淚的結晶處處都是表現作者特具的偉大關於這一點在孫　工先生的序文裏是分祈得很詳細這序文的起首就這樣的說</p>
<p>在充滿了恐怖的殺氣的愛河之水枯涸了的中國現代得讀到湯增敭君這個集子丨姊姊的殘骸我將怎樣欣喜呢</p>
<p>世界太大了人類底理知又是那麽複雜予盾人生底意義無形地消失於此種現象中眞正太不值得了</p>
<p>愛是連絡人類理知底複雜與予盾的網詩人就是緊緊地握着這種網底總網丨網之頂一樣的東西的手持着網之頂把網目張開於是大地人類都一個個籠罩在這　底下大地底一切人類底一切不論有形無形都純化淨化調和化美化而達於人生底偉大之域這就是詩人底手腕呀</p>
<p>增敭在這集子裏所表現的就是充滿了愛的那物的他底（姊姊）無非是愛底象徴其（殘骸）恰是經過了一番恐怖的殺氣的愛底被蹂躪被　踏的情　也就是枯涸了水的愛之河的表　象</p>
<p>這實是詩人底苦心呀</p>
<p>在這裏孫先生已經把這散文集裏所含有的意義已解釋得異常的詳盡但是這决不是一種平凡的没有根據的的解釋無疑地是依照着詩底原理更其注意於這散文集裏作者所特具的那種愛底表現所以（詩人的情感特别底豐富）一語在我們讀了這集子之後至少會深信無疑的了同時我們要曉得不久之前中國的文壇不但黑漆一團並且充滿了極形恐怖的殺氣所謂普羅的詩歌除了實目的狂吠一下至多也不過是在摇旗呐喊根本没有什麽意義可言　底形式與技巧一點也不加以注意使我們讀了祇感到它底口號的標語的簡直不能成的一種文學的作品這種現象當然是中國文藝界所呈顯的最大的危機這部（姊姊的殘骸）在詩底實質上却是成功之作已達到那藝衛底最高峯的</p>
<p>全書計包含十八篇散文（一）月夜（二）繚繞的幽魂（三）淚影（四）姊姊的殘骸（五）她的呐喊（六）冬的苦笑（七）祝福（八）生命的紅酒（九）墓草叢中的骷髏（十）夜深了（十一）落花的殘運（十二）渺茫的歸宿（十三）愛的潰滅（十四）無名的詩魂（十五）新的嬰孩（十六）殘疾的心靈（十七）古海之化石（十八）最後的喪鐘篇前附有卷首詩（死前的豫禱尤爲輕婉流利實屬不易多見的詩作</p>
<p>（詩人底傷感殆是其本性這是誰都承認的增敭在這集子裏感傷的色彩很重也是當然的）這話是孫先生在序文裏所說但是具有充分的理由例如作者在（月夜）一篇裏有這樣的所說</p>
<p>（明月的光輝籠　着的花陰叢裏淪落苦海中的我也曾一度擁抱過少女作愛的安慰吻憔悴的務唇上土還殘留　將逝的口紅笑倦縮的兩耳　還充滿</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>着低微的　　歌寂寞的腦海中還深印着嬌喘的音波其實過去的幻迹有如銀幕般的舒展在凄慘而模糊的　　追憶起不禁黯然銷魂現今我是　别了可愛的故鄉沈淪在異地的源淵裏了</p>
<p>悵望雲山祗有下淚</p>
<p>（在這裏處詩人固已赤裸裸地一顆感傷的心展布在人們之前哩）（然而感傷是眞的感傷並不是徒然地無病呻吟的感傷故增敭底感傷自有其感傷的特點所在他是輕輕地踏過了他底（姊姊的殘骸）而走到了一世界的人故其感傷也有如此丨丨他是已經超越了感傷的實境而踏進了理想之國的）關於這一點在他（繚繞的幽魂）中寫得很明澈但是他這種感傷却含有無限的努力和希望的深義這作者是很顯明的這樣的寫着　　（懽樂是須要自已鼓起勇氣去追求幸福是須要自已努力直前去攫去歷史的事實在這樣的詔示我感覺了····）一過去已經成了不可捉摸的幻影未來或許藴蓄着一線燦爛的希望啊今後唯有振作起固有精力向前去與阻止人類自由進展的黯搏戰攫取時代前頭顯耀著的榮光···）月夜）　　（在朦朧的思緒中祇企求著光明的未來）（冬的苦笑）</p>
<p>像這些刻畫都自與頽廢詩人底專傾注於感傷者不同眞的像作（冬的苦笑）裏所寫（是如何地奮勉更其是一般詩人所不易有的偉大了）這實是最正確没有的批判了（至於集中詞句底精鍊描寫底細密結構底整潔）我也如孫先生所說（凡讀了的人想都能感到故不　述）</p>

<p>日本通信謝海燕</p>
<p>（五續）</p>
<p>看了桑重儀一氏的（中華雙嬌）畫中兩女子我不禁想到上海時裝月份牌畫家鄭曼陀氏這個人來了</p>
<p>田邊至氏的（畫室）是一幀純然官學派的産兒缺點很多主要的是裸女的肉感性太濃空間性的表現太淺且太走於細部的描寫</p>
<p>池部鈞氏的（舞蹈）作者原是一個高名的漫畫家用他慣作漫畫的手腕來揮成這動作的舞蹈人手自然能奏相當的效果</p>
<p>長原孝太郎氏的（明星）不是二十世紀的人當然和我們没有關係作者是白馬會的遺老</p>
<p>大久保作次郎氏的（青菜市場）平俗</p>
<p>石川寅治氏的（蘇州之春乾燥）　　金山平三氏的（春）纖巧有和田氏風</p>
<p>高間惣七氏的（窗之朝）構圖失均調没有統一的效果但輕快明暢的色彩也夠能奪回這畫已失去的勝利氏和牧野氏的作風共通的地方很多不過牧野氏是以雄渾奔放的精神勝而他是以輕妙洒脫的精神勝的</p>
<p>一角古風涌溢的中國式的廳景擺着一把交椅和一只小茶几几的上面有一瓶盛開的鮮花擱着花的後面有一對隸書的七字聯掛着右角上埀着一盞紅紗燈燈下有一個穿藍花緞衣服的女孩伸出白嫩的手看似在點燈的情景這幀畫題名做（支那燈籠）作者是不　舍系遺老現太平洋畫會的會員高村眞夫氏我眞莫解爲什麽不把這畫同和田英作氏的（早春）掛在一起呢</p>
<p>三田康氏的（坐像）是態度愼重的作品色彩的感覺甚佳</p>
<p>鈴木千久馬氏的（草上裸婦）是今年帝展之一大收穫雄厚的霸氣足以懾服一般無膽的帝展作家而有餘畫面很大至少在三百號以上每年的帝展尤其是今年的帝展像這麽大的畫是指不勝屈的爲名譽（自然是爲虚名）爲獎金不怪他們要如此雖然氏不是區區爲此的</p>
<p>伊原宇三郎氏的（二人）以二裸婦　成一個三角形配以綠藍赤的對照色備具一種幽雅的熟鍊的功夫氏的作風原有點和ＰＩＣＡＳＳＯ相像的惜今年的作品相去殊遠顯明的破綻是全畫墮入普通的寫實逐漸有官學派的趨向氏現在病著大概是爲這難産的嬰兒竭盡心血所致附筆於此祝他康健</p>
<p>淺井眞氏的（白船入港）給我以無限的趣味與慰安彷佛我已回到上海竚立在黃浦江畔外灘公園臨江的欄干裏　　誰也知道日本的山羊畫家辻永氏的有名的山羊吧但遺憾得很大根槪他是厭聽人家給他這個命名已經許久不拿山羊來做題材了他出品今年帝展的是一幅題名呌做（庭）的風景畫我雖然没有眼福來看山羊畫家的有名的山羊但是在這小小的風景畫裏頭也能夠看出一點山羊的趣味來的</p>
<p>官學派中唯一的構想畫的作家堅守著頑迷的牙城抗拒新時代思潮的健將帝國美術院會員太平洋畫會的主帥中村不折氏替他擔憂的人說（此老每次展覽總要出一張中國的歷史畫什麽（盧生之夢）什麽（杜樹之井）什麽（煨芋不答宣使）什麽（賺蘭亭圖）今年又出了一張呌做什麽（蘇武之苦節）這麽一來中國的歷史故事終究没有告罄之一天嗎其實替他擔憂的人是淺見了的中國是持有數千年文化歷史的最古國何愁没有古怪的歷史的題材來供給他呢假使他每年能夠畫成五十張又假使他穩穩能活到五百歲我想總也不致會没有題材供給他吧</p>
<p>猪熊一郎氏的（ＣＯＭＰＯＳＩＴＩＯＮ）（構圖）是塲中屈指的大作有ＰＩＣＡＳＳＯ和ＤＥＲＡＩＮ的構圖趣味</p>
<p>在這溷濁的泥池中長出一大輪高潔的白蓮使人覺得格外可愛的就是中野和高氏的（無題）是一幅描寫日本田園生活的傑作全畫充溢着抒情詩的音樂低音階的情緒是依着現代的感覺向自由的世界去探討的勝利品搆　十分有趣左面的馬和人物及後面的家屋樹木搆成一小組右面的站着的人物和斜臥着的人物搆成一大組然後用背景的山嶺和森林及前面的三根木頭連成一個非常和諧的統一畫面再以自由不拘筆調和純朴快活的色彩完成這傑作的生命</p>
<p>齋藤與里氏的（春之夕）是春夕底牧歌的情景然惜其旨趣近於物語而離現實</p>
<p>吉村芳松氏的（季人閑居）是一幀中國舊家庭的縮影</p>
<p>佐片德次郎氏的（巖）太陷於寫實　　上野山清貢氏的（航海）濁色的剌載力太强構圖稚拙欠歸統是一幅未完成的作品</p>
<p>他如片岡銀藏氏的（仰臥裸婦）矢島堅土氏的（室内）寺内萬治郎氏的（裸婦）鹿子木孟郎氏的（北海道層雲峽）新井完氏的（天平塑像）安宅安五郎氏的（髮）服部亮英氏的（裸婦）松邨巽氏的（窗邊）熊岡美彦氏的（緋　　集）吉田博氏的（雲之海）清水良雄的（斜陽）小柴錦侍氏的（ＬＥＤＡＭＥＡＵＸＲＯＳＥＳ）三上知治氏的（狼犬）白　幾之助氏的（秋郊）永地秀太氏的（麥態）柚木久太氏的（泉　）有馬ＳＡＴＯＥ氏的（寫生的人）小寺健吉氏的（瘦了的裸婦）大野隆德氏的（摇籃與小孩）··等作品其中也有好的不過限於時間不能逐一介紹實在抱歉得很將來如有機機再引出來和諸位細談一下現在帝展洋畫部一巡記就在這兒告一結束</p>

<p>（三續）安平節譯</p>
<p>所以這樣看來美國的作家的所以對於英國頌讚崇拜並没有什麽稀奇就如ＤＯＷＮＩＮＧＳＴＲＥＥＴ（雜誌名）之論述着關於美國的財政倫敦的一些雜誌之論述着關於今日的批評家們的繩準和决斷一樣一個美國作家要是爲英國所承認了他將立刻成爲一個國際上的名人他不僅得到他的聲譽並且在貝體的東西上他也有所獲得隨便在什麽情形之下他總是佔光着的自然這一部分的關係完全是受了心理上的影響的而他們的聲譽却仍然不爲人所否認祇有那種作家那種爲着另一種讀者而寫的作家如美國的拓荒者惠脫孟和麥克湯們他們有着一種關於國界的靈魂祇有那種作家可以不爲那種英國氣息所影響　　但是無論如何自從美國在世界上的國際地位升高了以後這種影響便漸漸減少起來在以前美國的文學没有他自已的地位因爲根本美國在西半各國之間便没有他自已的充分的地位的緣故他是一個正在長成着的國家但他究竟也還没有完全長成而祇要美國的國際地位一局於是這種情形便立刻改換了過來國家的一切心理也改換了過來了漸漸地美國的作家們覺得美國的文學必定要有他自已的塲合應當和他的（國家）聯繫而在這樣一個時候惠脫孟和麥克湯才爲那些文藝家批評家們所認識也許要是美國不加入世界大戰不起而代英國爲世界之牛耳這轉變仍然不能成功但無論如何英國所遺留給美國的氣息至少已經到了末日從那時起能成功但無論如何英國所遺留給美國的氣息至少已經到了末日從那時起充斥着一種新的力最的美國的文學從舊的縛束中解放了出來他對於他自已的才就深信着而且不覺得有别的比他更可稱頌些地將他們的新的命運雕琢了出來</p>
<p>這一個新的命運之自然性是什麽呢誰是這個新的波浪中的代表呢在詩的一方面我們在他們所謂的（文藝上的激進堂）他們在他們自已的特殊的風格裏代表了這新的氣息那些詩人如羅惠爾（ＡＭＹＬＯＷＥＬＬ）弗路斯脫（ＲＯＢＥＲＴＦＩＯＳＴ）桑朋（ＣＡＲＬＳＡＮＤＥＥＲＧ）郎特賽）ＶＡＣＨＥＬＬＩＮＤＳＡＹ）齊否（ＲＡＢＩＮＳＯＮＪＥＴＴＥＲＳ）和麥斯透（ＥＤＧＡＲＭＥＥＭＡＳＴＥＲ）等都是這一類的作家但這些作家不論直接間接多少總受有着些惠脫孟的詩的影響没有一個人可以將英國的型典作家的名字來移送給他們以作一種稱頌的意思的他們都是非常明顯的十足美國人就是羅惠爾雖然他是受若英國氣名的薰染很深的人他的情感也仍然不脫於孟特鈴和薔薇花之回憶但他却一樣的加入了對英國的反叛的活動如一個ＭＩＤＷＥＳＴＥＲＮ派的詩人一樣實際上她的在現代詩律上的新的趨向之熱忱的辯護對於現在美國的詩的復興也未見有多大的帮助及力量　羅惠爾一樣情形的還有兩個女人一個呌蒙羅（ＨＡＲＲＥＲＭＯＮＲＯＥ）她在她的雜誌（詩）上會集了一大羣關於這一時代的反叛詩人另一個則呌安豆孫（ＭＡＲＧＡＲＥＴＡＮＤＥＲＳＯＮ）她在她的（小雜誌）上（ＴＨＥＤＦＴＴＬＥＲＥＶＥＩＥＷ）也努力着如蒙羅同樣的工作不過她所努力的不是詩而是散文</p>
<p>但是這些詩人不過將美國的背在景他們的個人意志裏表現了出來而已他們的行動完全是個人的而非社會的惠脫孟之舊的詩格的　人挑戰之所以能夠克眼這新派的原因就在此如在古明（ＥＥＣＵＭＭＩＮＧＳ）和斯丁（ＧＥＩＴＲＩＤＥＳＥＩＮ）的詩裏個人主義流露得那樣濃烈幾乎完全成爲一種絶望的除瘧符（ＡＢＲＡＣＡＤＡＢＲＡ）但無論如何在大體上如在桑朋弗羅斯脫魯賓孫郎特賽和麥斯透等的詩裏都包有着一種外部和内體的平衡依照美國的情景看來這些對於他們一切在理論及技巧上個人的衝突表示若輕視的新詩人一致的反對着胡惠爾（ＨＯＷＥＬＬＳ）的那句話（越是在生命上顯着非常活躍的精神的越可表示是一個美國人）他們覺得現在美國所呈現着的不是（生命的活躍的精神）的一點而是土地的擴大的一點美國現在成爲世界上的領袖國一個世界底權力但是他在那一點上可以顯出他的力量呢在機器上在發明上在貨品上一個在汽與鋼的機軸上輪轉着的國家但是在個人的靈魂上又有什麽事个遭遇到呢他將毁滅當他在初步的程序中便將毁滅而在這文學上的反叛運動中的這個人主義的精神終於要犧牲下去而傾向到集團的作用的一方面</p>

<h3 id="e2">Song Ziwen Issues Another Circular Telegram to Implement the Policy of Abolishing Likin <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: Minister of Finance Song Ziwen issued a circular telegram stating: "All newspaper offices are aware that this ministry, following the resolution of the plenary session of the Central Executive Committee, has urged the implementation of the abolition of likin and all similar taxes. Orders have been issued to all agencies to strictly comply, and reports have been submitted and circulars issued, all duly recorded. Likin was originally a local revenue, while land tax was a national revenue. Previous governments followed this practice. After the reform by the National Government, likin was changed to national revenue and land tax to local revenue, as clearly defined in the national and local tax regulations two years ago, with the determination to abolish likin and transfer this loss to the central government to ensure thorough implementation. It is now calculated that the ministry will incur the following annual losses after the abolition of the aforementioned items: likin, 80 million yuan; regular customs, 7.75 million yuan; re-import tax, 5.4 million yuan; child (子) port tax, 3.6 million yuan; railway freight tax, 1.54 million yuan; parcel tax, 1.07 million yuan; totaling 99.36 million yuan. Currently, amidst the financial panic, the treasury is empty, and military and administrative expenses are urgently needed. The difference between revenue and expenditure is vast, requiring daily efforts to manage. Once a large amount of money disappears without a source and the introduction of new taxes must be in accordance with economic principles, without hindering industrial and commercial development, adequate preparations should be made and preliminary plans are vague. Therefore, the responsibility and difficulties faced by this ministry are overwhelming. Considering that this measure has hindered people's livelihood for many years, the government, in order to realize the policy of innovation, relieve the people's suffering, and demonstrate to the world, resolutely abolishes likin. As there is no room for careful consideration regarding the major plan, the difficulties are inevitable. Only by adhering to this spirit of sacrifice can we forge a brighter path. The current situation in each province is undoubtedly the same as the ministry's, difficult. It is hoped that we can all overcome difficulties together, working together, helping each other, and understanding each other, in order to overcome the difficulties.</p>
<p>At the same time, the reorganization of land tax and the initiation of business tax should be actively implemented to supplement the treasury's income and avoid hindering provincial administration, ensuring consistent implementation. The party and the country are fortunate indeed. I humbly announce this and hope for clear understanding. Respectfully, Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance." (23rd) The Nanjing Ministry of Finance has re-ordered various tax collection agencies to comply with the time limit for the abolition of likin and similar miscellaneous taxes and levies. Any acts of superficial compliance will be punished according to law. At the same time, reports on the preparations for the abolition will be submitted to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Executive Yuan for record. (A circular telegram will be sent to all provinces and municipalities for sincere assistance.) (December 23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Arguments That the World is Gradually Awakening <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The reason why today's major world problems are trapped in a helpless situation is not that there are truly no solutions. There are good solutions, but everyone pushes and shirks responsibility, unwilling to take the lead in implementing them, thinking that promoting a so-called good solution in the world must initially require some sacrifice, or a great deal of effort, or risk. However, people are unwilling to sacrifice themselves first, but only blame others for sacrificing; people are unwilling to put in effort and take risks themselves first, but only blame others for putting in effort and taking risks. Thus, they have already lost the fundamental meaning of cooperation and mutual assistance. This is why, although there are good proposals, we have not yet seen any of them realized. Looking at the news of the past two days, the hearts of the people in the world may be gradually awakening. Let's cite two examples to illustrate this.</p>
<p>One is the problem of rescuing the silver devaluation. A report by the European Finance Trust Company stated that if the countries of the world do not want to trap the East in deeper misery, they must first remove the short-sighted national narrow-mindedness. The gold delegation of the League of Nations also said that to seek improvement in the current situation, there is no need to talk about altruism. Our assistance to our Eastern friends is precisely to assist ourselves, because preventing the decline in the price of silver is precisely to initiate the power that can increase general prices and strengthen international commerce. If the countries of the world can think from this perspective in order to rescue the silver devaluation, then perhaps it will be close to being realized.</p>
<p>One is the issue of implementing disarmament. Three Americans, Roth, Batchellor, and Lobrand, issued a declaration urging the United States to practice military reduction, saying that the United States has no choice but to reduce its military for the sake of its national prestige. Breaking its word is definitely not something the United States should do. Although there are various obstacles, in order to maintain its previous words, it will disregard everything. If the United States can resolutely and resolutely disregard everything and first implement military reduction itself, then other countries that are watching will definitely have no words to delay any further.</p>
<p>The words described in the above two matters seem to be slightly more concise than all other empty words, or they are the beginnings of an awakening in the hearts of the people of the world.</p>

<h3 id="e10">National Government Instructs All Agencies to Implement Political Reform <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: The National Government instructed all Yuan, Ministries, Departments, and Councils, to comply with the Central Political Council's letter, stating that the Fourth Plenary Political Conference of the Third Central Executive Committee discussed and resolved to reform central politics, improve the system, rectify the code of law, establish a central administration within the shortest time frame to improve administrative efficiency. Section A, Clause 4 regarding the organization of other ministries, departments, and councils, which should strive to reduce the number of personnel and strictly define the number of staff. The organization of all units directly under the administration of the various ministries should be reduced in size and expenses should be saved. These measures were to be reviewed and decided by the Central Political Council. Section B, Clause 7, which vigorously implements administrative reduction, merges and abolishes redundant agencies, was to be decided by the Central Political Council in principle and implemented level by level by the National Government. The aforementioned was sent to the Political Report Group for review. The report stated that the two cases have been merged for review, and that the committees and offices within various ministries and councils that are only of a temporary nature and do not require permanent establishment, or whose affairs originally belonged to the respective departments in charge and do not require separate agencies, should be separately abolished and merged. It is proposed that the National Government order all Yuan, Ministries, Departments, and Councils to prepare a plan for the abolition and merger of existing non-essential subordinate agencies or temporary organizations within ten days, in accordance with the following principles: (1) They must not exceed the approved administrative scope. (2) They must not create disputes over authority with other ministries and councils. (3) They must not split the functions of the original responsible departments within the agency. The agencies should truthfully prepare a plan for abolition and merger, and submit a minimum defined organization and staffing plan to the Council for review and approval. It was also resolved at the 254th meeting of the Council to pass the review opinion and forward it to the National Government to issue orders to all Yuan, Ministries, Departments, and Councils to comply as scheduled, and report back for transfer and review, without any delay, and to instruct and comply with this order separately.

<p>Military and Peasant Rebellion, Government Denies Rumors</p>
<p>London News - News from Moscow says that the Red Army and workers and peasants of the Soviet Union have recently shown dissatisfaction and major secret resistance plans toward the dictator Stalin, and the whole Soviet Union is deeply worried that a major change will occur this winter. If this occurs while the new five-year economic plan is halfway through, it will be affected and the Soviet Union's economy will be in an unrecoverable situation. According to the London Daily Mail correspondent in Moscow, he personally saw the secret warnings to comrades at home and abroad from Stalin and his followers, saying that they should unite to defend against internal traitors and be vigilant at all times to overcome chaos. The first item in the notice had large-character instructions (destroy after reading), indicating the importance and secrecy of its nature. The contents of the notice generally stated that the number of reactionary elements in the Red Army has gradually increased, and most senior officers are actively assisting the right-wing leaders to oppose the authorities, and even publicly stated their support for Red Army leader Voroshilov to resist Stalin. Moreover, this kind of rebellion is very difficult to deal with, because there are very few outspoken people, and most people ostensibly obey the party's orders, but secretly prepare to overthrow the current Communist Party Executive Committee. The rebels dare to do this because there are many supporters. Recently, in various parts of the country, especially in the Donets Basin, the Urals, and western Siberia, all industrial workers have destroyed a large number of working machines and reduced output to make things difficult for the authorities and hinder the progress of the five-year new economic plan. Moreover, these people who destroy tools are ordinary workers and are highly contagious. The seriousness of the situation lies in this. The peasant rebellion has also reached a dangerous peak. No matter what orders the government gives to the farmers, the farmers always respond by destroying large agricultural tools, making the government unable to cope. If armed communists are ordered to collect grain, they are often killed. Statistics show that as many as 500 people have been killed in half a month. It is also noteworthy that no members of the Moscow Committee have dared to personally visit various agricultural areas since May 1 of this year, which shows that the facts are there and difficult to conceal.

<p>Reuters, London, 22nd - Mrs. Subbarayan and Mrs. Naidu spoke at the selection committee of the Indian Roundtable Conference today and presented a paper on the status of Indian women under the proposed constitution. Speakers said that the Roundtable Conference should stipulate the future status of women, and that if it is postponed until later, it will not be subject to proper review. Although the current provisions for male and female election qualifications are equal, they are mostly based on property ownership, and few women own property. Therefore, special provisions should be made for women's election qualifications and the number of seats they occupy in parliament to prevent them from being monopolized by men.</p>

<p>Loss of US Prestige</p>
<p>Former Secretary of State Issues Statement</p>
<p>Associated Press, New York, 22nd - Robert Root, a member of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former Secretary of State, Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, president of Columbia University, and Mr. White jointly issued a statement urging the United States to fulfill its promises of disarmament under the Treaty of Versailles. They said that when the Allies persuaded Germany to obey the peace treaty at Versailles, they said that once Germany ceased hostilities and signed a treaty, the world would begin to disarm from then on. Now, eleven years have passed, and the promise of disarmament has still not been fulfilled. The United States must disarm for the sake of its national prestige. It is not the United States' place to break promises for its own benefit, and even if there are various technical obstacles, it cannot be ignored for the sake of maintaining previous statements.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Commander-in-Chief Chiang's Arrival in Hankou <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Communication on the 21st: Commander-in-Chief Chiang arrived in Jiangxi from Nanjing at the beginning of this month to supervise the suppression of bandits and communists. He then took the opportunity to visit Lushan and summoned important generals from Hunan and Hubei provinces to meet him in Lushan. The local headquarters and the headquarters of the Third Army received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief on the 20th, stating that he would arrive in Hankou by ship on that day and instructing not to alarm various agencies and organizations. Therefore, the headquarters followed the order and did not notify various parties, but the provincial government urgently telegraphed the public security bureaus of various ports along the river to report the time of the Yong Sui warship's passage through the port in order to arrange security and gather to welcome him. At 2:00 AM that night, the Chu Qian warship docked at the Han River received a wireless telegraph from the Chu You and Yong Sui warships, stating that they had anchored near Huangzhou. It was estimated that they would arrive in Hankou at 12:00 noon on the 21st. After hearing the news, all circles here dispatched representatives to the Sanbei Company wharf one after another at 9:00 AM on the 21st to welcome him. The security forces were commanded by Liu Hantao, the commander of the 77th Regiment of the 13th Division. The first security line was responsible by the security department's mobile brigade. The second security line was responsible by the 77th Regiment of the 13th Division. The headquarters' guard brigade was responsible for guarding the inner streets and the vicinity of the Diplomatic Commissioner's Office. Sentries were stationed along the way by the 283rd Regiment of the 48th Division and the Gendarmerie Battalion. The Water Police Bureau patrolled the river surface, and personnel from the Inspection Office and the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau maintained order on the scene. Although the north wind was biting and it was raining and snowing, the order was still very strict. As for the welcoming personnel, there were hundreds of military officers above the rank of major general and civilian officials above the selected rank. On the military officer side, there were General Commander He Chengjun, Xia Douyin, Xu Yuanquan, He Jian, Division Commander Zhao Guantao, Fan Mingsheng, Xiao Zhichu, Fan Xiji, Xie Bin, Yuan Ying, Hao Mengling, Yue Weijun, Guo Runian, Deputy Division Commander Luo Zhuoying, Brigade Commander Wan Yaohuang, Wang Naiwen, etc., and Headquarters Chief of Staff Xian Chuanjing, Third Army Headquarters Chief of Staff Chen Guangzu, Security Department Chief of Staff Ye Peng, and Zhao Dajun, Director of the Managerial Office in Desert, etc. On the civilian officer side, there were Fang Benren, Wu Xingya, Liu Wendao, Xiong Bingkun, Huang Jianzhong, Hua Jueming, Chen Keming, Li Boren, and Provincial and Municipal Party Committee Liu Baifang, Yang Zaichun, Zuo Duo, Wang Shi[blank], Wen Juntian, Yu Yuzhi, and Qiu Hongjun, etc. The security department separately issued three types of red special symbols, yellow ordinary symbols, and boarding passes in advance. The scene was quite grand for a time. Until 1:10 PM, the Yong Sui warship approached from afar. All Chinese and foreign warships anchored in the Han River raised flags and fired twenty-one salute guns to pay their respects. The sound of gunfire rumbled and shook the entire city. The Yong Sui warship also fired salute guns in response. After the warship docked, Director He led the personnel above the rank of division commander and Fang Benren, Wu Xingya, Liu Wendao, etc. to board the ship to pay their respects for about ten minutes. At this time, the weather suddenly cleared, and the rain and snow stopped slightly. At 1:30 PM, Commander-in-Chief Chiang slowly disembarked wearing a gray military uniform and a black coat, looking energetic. Those who disembarked with him included Central Committee member Wu Weihui, Shao Lizi, Director of the Political Training Department Zhou Fohai, and welcoming personnel. At that time, the military and police raised their guns, and the military band played music in unison. Civilian and military officials also took off their hats and stood in respect. Commander-in-Chief Chiang raised his hand, smiled, and returned the salute. Mr. Wu Zhihui wore a gray patriotic cloth robe and an old top hat, walked with a calm pace, and looked extremely vigorous. After arriving ashore, Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Mr. Wu took car number 626 directly to the Diplomatic Commissioner's Office. Director He and the division commanders followed in cars. After Chiang arrived at the headquarters, he briefly inquired about the situation from the generals and then rested. This reporter went to the headquarters to meet Central Committee member Shao Lizi. According to him, Commander-in-Chief Chiang set off from Lushan at 8:00 AM on the 20th and departed from Jiujiang at 11:00 AM, accompanied by Mr. Wu Zhihui, Director Zhou Fohai, and himself (Shao self-proclaimed). In addition, there were Chief of Staff of the Headquarters Lin Wei and dozens of staff members, as well as a battalion of the guard brigade. The Minquan and Chu You warships also followed from Xunyang to escort him to Hankou. The number of days Commander-in-Chief will stay in Hankou and the date of return to Nanjing are currently undetermined. This reporter then visited Director Zhou Fohai. According to him, Commander-in-Chief Chiang's trip to Hunan may be canceled, and the trip to Xi'an is even more uncertain. The number of troops suppressing bandits in Jiangxi Province has increased and are actively suppressing bandits according to plan. Deng Ying was dismissed and severely punished for his ineffectiveness in suppressing bandits and is currently under guard by the Jiangxi Provincial Government. In addition to the first batch of Headquarters staff led by Adjutant General Zhan Zhenhuang who have arrived in Hankou, there were more than forty people who arrived with him that day.</p>
<p>Hankou Communication on the 22nd: After Commander-in-Chief Chiang arrived in Hankou on the 21st, he summoned He Chengjun, He Jian, Xia Douyin, Xu Yuan, Xiao Zhi, Fan Shisheng, Fan Xiji, Yue Weijun, Guo Ru, Yuan Ying, Fang Benren, Wu Xingya, Liu Wendao, etc. to inquire about the situation of bandit suppression. He Jian also requested to meet Chiang again at 4:00 PM on the 21st. Commander-in-Chief Chiang gave detailed instructions on the Hunan Province bandit suppression plan. He then returned to Hunan by car with his entourage at 8:00 PM that night. On the 22nd, Commander-in-Chief Chiang met with representatives and generals. He also hosted a banquet for military officers at 7:00 PM, which was very busy. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting with He Jian: Commander-in-Chief Chiang met with He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, at 4:00 PM on the 21st. He gave a very detailed report on the recent situation of the communist bandits in Hunan Province and the progress of the suppression. Commander-in-Chief Chiang then ordered He to return to Hunan as soon as possible to preside over everything. He returned to Hunan by express train with his entourage at 8:00 PM, leaving Song Hegeng, Gao Daoshun, and Wang Dazhen of the Provincial Committee in Hankou to inquire whether Commander-in-Chief Chiang would go to Hunan. However, the Hunanese in Hankou believed that Commander-in-Chief Chiang would reward and punish those who suppressed bandits. Deng Ying had already been dismissed and severely punished for losing Ji'an, so it was not appropriate to be lenient to those responsible for losing Changsha. They specially formed a petition group to rescue Hunan and petitioned the Commander-in-Chief. However, Chiang was too busy and did not meet them today, according to reports.</p>
<p>Meeting with Representatives: Commander-in-Chief Chiang instructed the headquarters to schedule meetings with representatives from various places and military officers above the rank of army commander, division commander, brigade commander, and regimental commander. The headquarters immediately issued an urgent notice stating that Commander-in-Chief Chiang instructed to meet with representatives from various places at 10:00 AM on the 22nd and to instruct military officers above the rank of army commander, division commander, brigade commander, and regimental commander at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Unless otherwise notified, it is hoped that they will go to Commander-in-Chief's office at the specified time and wait for the summons. By 7:00 AM on the 22nd, the representatives had arrived at the headquarters. Commander-in-Chief Chiang summoned them by name, including Li Zhigang, representative of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, and Zhang Buxian, representative of the Guizhou Provincial Government. He then met with former Acting Chairman of Hubei Province Fang Benren, Wang Cibo, representative of the 22nd Route Army stationed in Nanjing, Zhang Yinxiang, commander of the 30th Division, Peng Jinzhi, commander of the Third Brigade of the First Division, Peng Qibiao, deputy commander of the Fourth Division, Hu Yuza, director of the Hanyang Arsenal, Zhou Xingtang, Huang Wenzhi, and other representatives of the Hankou General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Summoning Generals: At 1:00 PM, Commander-in-Chief Chiang summoned military officers above the rank of army commander to inquire about their hometowns, ages, backgrounds, experiences, and the recent situation of their troops. After the generals reported, Chiang made pertinent criticisms and earnestly instructed them to improve military discipline and protect the people as the permanent struggle of the party and the country, and awarded each regimental commander 300 yuan as encouragement. From 1:00 PM to 7:00 PM, they were summoned in batches and comforted one by one. However, Han Jie, commander of the temporarily compiled Independent Second Brigade, was said to have been detained.</p>
<p>Banquet and Meeting: After Commander-in-Chief Chiang met with the representatives and generals, he hosted a banquet for the generals at the Diplomatic Commissioner's Office that evening, including General Commander of the First Army He Chengjun, General Commander of the Sixteenth Route Army Xu Yuanquan, General Commander of the Twenty-first Route Army Xia Douyin, Commander of the Sixth Division Zhao Guantao, Commander of the Fifty-fourth Division Hao Mengling, Commander of the Forty-fourth Division Xiao Zhichu, Commander of the Seventy-sixth Division Li Wanlin, Commander of the Fifty-first Division Fan Shisheng, Commander of the Twenty-sixth Division Guo Runian, Commander of the Thirty-fourth Division Yue Weijun, Commander of the Seventieth Division Fan Longgeng, Commander of the Sixty-eighth Division Li Wanru, Commander of the Sixty-ninth Division Liang Guanying, and Wu Xingya, Director of the Hubei Department of Civil Affairs, Liu Wendao, Mayor of Hankou, and dozens of others. During the banquet, Commander-in-Chief Chiang gave extremely important instructions and decided to convene a military conference with the commanders-in-chief, army commanders, division commanders, Wu Xingya, and Liu Wendao after the banquet to instruct on bandit suppression and politics.</p>
<p>Inspection of Troops: At 8:00 AM on the 23rd, he went to the new barracks in Qiaokou to inspect the troops of the Wuhan North District Fortress Command and gave instructions. On the 24th, he went to the Wuhan Military Academy to inspect and give instructions, which had been arranged by Yin Zusheng, Commander of the Wuhan North District Fortress, and Xue Lian, Chief of Staff of the Third Training Division, respectively. The welcome rally of all circles will be held after instructions are requested. Wu Jingheng, Shao Lizi, and Zhou Fohai, members of the Central Committee, who came to Hankou with Chiang, had their lectures scheduled by He Chengjun at the Provincial Government at 3:00 PM on the 23rd, and all subordinate agency staff have been notified to gather at the Provincial Government Auditorium to listen to the lectures.</p>
<p>Chiang's Itinerary: Chiang's original schedule after departing from Nanjing was to first visit Jiangxi, then Hubei, and then Hunan. However, after He Jian was summoned to Lushan, all the bandit conditions in Hunan Province were reported in detail. After Chiang arrived in Hankou, He asked for instructions and then returned to Hunan. It seems that Chiang does not need to go to Hunan. Moreover, the New Year's Day military parade in Nanjing is not far away, and it is difficult to go to Hunan from afar. However, according to today's news, Chiang will still go to Hunan after inspecting the Wuhan Military Academy on the 24th, either by warship, special train, or plane. It is not yet determined. According to another source, he will go to Xinyang and then return to Hankou and then to Nanjing. As for the trip to Hunan Province, He Chengjun will be sent as a representative. It is not yet certain which statement is correct.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Gong Bingfan's Division Captures Donggu <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Donggu and Jinggang are Equally Famous</p>
<p>It is an Important Nest of the Communist Party</p>
<p>Rescued 300 Hostages</p>
<p>Killed Over 1,000 Bandits</p>
<p>Luo Lin Captures Yifu on the Same Day</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang's troops gathered in the southeastern part of Jiangxi Province in Le'an, Ningdu, Xingguo, and the southwestern part in Suichuan, Wan'an, Taihe, Anfu, and Lianhua. The 6th, 9th, and 19th Route Armies were divided into routes to encircle and suppress them. The 9th Route Army advanced southeast along the Gan River. The 19th Route Army recovered Yongxin, Lianhua, Taihe, and Suichuan from Pingxiang, bypassed the Gan River, and detoured south of Xingyu to prevent the communist bandits from fleeing to Guangdong. The 6th Route Army attacked forward from eastern Jiangxi towards Zhao Xie of Le'an and Qia Village of Nanfeng, bypassing Ruijin and Shicheng to reach Ningdu and cut off Zhu and Mao from entering Fujian. After the deployment was completed, the entire army launched a general offensive on the 16th. Because Donggu was the base camp of Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang, and the terrain was dangerous, and all kinds of agencies were available, it was no less than the second Jinggang. Special attention was paid to attacking Donggu. Gong Bingfan's division attacked the front of Donggu, Luo Lin's division took the right wing to capture Anfu and connect with the 19th Route Army. Tan Daoyuan and Xu Kexiang's two divisions took the left wing to connect with the 6th Route Army. Starting from the 16th, the central route went straight to Xingyu, closely pressing the left and right to take the encirclement. Luo's division captured Gujiang and occupied Anfu on the 17th. Gong and Zhang's two divisions also broke the line of the communist bandits in Futian, Shuikou, and Baisha on the 17th, and advanced bravely. On the 18th, Gong's division defeated the communist bandit Liu Tiechao's troops and directly approached Donggu. However, the communist bandits built strong fortifications there and defended the dangerous terrain. On the morning of the 19th, Gong's division's soldiers charged the communist bandits more than ten times, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. Gong Bingfan also personally led the Chai brigade to advance, and there were also airplanes to assist in the battle. Until noon, Donggu Mountain was completely occupied, 300 hostages were rescued, more than 1,000 bandits were killed, and countless weapons and supplies were seized, and many machines were recovered. The communist bandits collapsed and retreated to the Ningyu area. At this moment, the 6th Route Army arrived in Guangchang and Ningdu, the 19th Route Army copied to Xingguo, and the 9th Route Army also advanced to the northwest of Xingning. Therefore, the communist bandits were already in a four-sided encirclement. Yesterday, the victorious telegrams from Gong's division and Zhang's division reported the victory. The original telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>The New Fifth Division's victory telegram briefly stated: (After our division recovered Futian, Mao Zedong's bandit troops collapsed to the right wing of the mountains. Division Commander Gong then sent Wang Maode, commander of the Ninth Brigade, to supervise his troops to pursue Donggu directly. On the 18th, they met Liu Tiechao's troops again halfway and fought fiercely twice, killing the pseudo-regimental commander Gao Kecheng, the pseudo-battalion commander Guo Guohua, and more than 300 bandits, and seized more than 30 long and short guns and countless weapons. On the morning of the 19th, Brigade Commander Wang ordered the 18th Regiment to advance towards Donggu via Baishicheng Gangxu, and led the 19th Regiment to take the Ninety Ridge and advance separately with the 18th Regiment. Division Commander Gong also personally led the Chai brigade and the replenishment regiment to assist from behind. Officers and soldiers of each unit fought fiercely and broke the enemy's strong trenches and finally broke Donggu at noon on the 19th. Zhu Peng's remaining bandits collapsed towards Gulonggang. More than 1,000 bandits were killed in this battle and three mortars and more than 270 long and short guns and countless weapons and flags were seized. Our division also suffered more than 200 casualties. Donggu has a dangerous terrain and has always been the base of the communist bandits in Jiangxi. Among them, there are communist bandits' schools, hospitals, and various levels of Soviet governments, and the electric lights and sewing machines that were previously in Ji'an were also transported to Donggu for the purpose of defending to the death. After our army recovered Donggu this time, it has taken back the electric lights and sewing machines and rescued more than 200 male and female hostages. With the bandit nest broken, the bandit forces are shaken, and the elimination of the remnants is just around the corner.)</p>
<p>The 18th Division's victory telegram briefly stated: A subordinate unit recovered Shuinan this afternoon. The people along the way escaped completely, the fields were barren, and corpses were lying everywhere. Reddish textbooks of the school, Donggu Agricultural and Industrial Bank paper money, and slogans of overthrowing counter-revolutionaries, avoiding war, and opportunists Mao Zedong were searched. According to the coerced people, Mao indeed had anti-Zhu actions, etc., which shows that the internal division of the communist bandits is not difficult to suppress. This is hereby telegraphed to the Party Department of the 108th Regiment. Another telegram from Zhang, commander of the 18th Division, stated: (On the 17th, Zhu Brigade (Yaohua) contacted about 1,000 bandits with about 300 guns in Shuinan, killing more than 70 bandits. Wang Brigade (Xian) contacted the pseudo-20th Army in Luodian Tianxu on the 16th, and the bandits scattered like birds and beasts, killing more than 5,000 bandits. Both Zhu and Wang Brigades found the pseudo-Jiangxi Executive Committee printing slogans of overthrowing counter-revolutionaries, avoiding war, and opportunists Mao Zedong. Local women also said that Mao Zedong opposed Zhu De) etc. (December 21st)</p>

<p>Mr. Rajchman Passes Through Harbin Southward</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Mr. Rajchman, the Health Director of the League of Nations Administrative Council, along with Mr. Wu Xiufeng, Secretary of the League of Nations Administrative Council Secretariat, and Mr. Jin Baoshan, Director of the National Government's Health Department, etc., passed through Harbin southward from Geneva on the 17th of this month. They are scheduled to stay in Peiping for several days before proceeding to Gaolaishi. According to Mr. Wu Xiufeng, their journey was approximately as follows: (They departed from Geneva, Switzerland, on December 5th, arrived in Warsaw on the 6th, departed from Warsaw on the 8th, and arrived in Moscow on the 9th. They changed trains on the same day and arrived at the border on the 17th.) Mr. Rajchman was invited by the National Government at the end of November this year to assist with China's health administration affairs. Mr. Rajchman also serves as a health advisor to the National Government. His actions will be dictated by the National Government. Last year, Mr. Rajchman came to China to negotiate a cooperation plan between the National Government and the League of Nations Health Organization. This plan has been approved by the National Government's Executive Yuan and the League of Nations, etc. Mr. Wu also said, "This year, the League of Nations re-elected its council members, and our country failed because: (1) Of the nine non-permanent council seats, one-third are re-elected each year. The Asian seat is currently held by Siam, and European and American countries are unwilling to have another Asian seat. (2) All countries have a negative impression of China due to the frequent civil wars in recent years. (3) Some countries have always opposed the system of re-election. (4) Countries are using the excuse that China has not been out of the Council for a full three years. Recently, with China unified and joining the League of Nations, their thoughts and perspectives have changed, and their expectations for our country are deep and great. The League of Nations also intends to provide China with talent and economic support, so there is hope for election in next year's Council re-election," etc. (18th)</p>

<p>Wuhu Dispatch: The Yangtze River steamer directly from Wuhu to other ports, as well as inland river routes to Nanjing, Anqing, Datong, Nanling, Xuancheng, Wuwei, Hefei, Chaoxian, etc., have all been robbed by bandits in recent years. Except for the Nanjing route, none have escaped, and some have been robbed multiple times. Unexpectedly, the Nanjing route was also robbed today. The Da'an Company's new Ningxing steamer departed from Nanjing this morning (22nd) at 7:00 AM, carrying passengers upstream to Wuhu. At 11:30 AM, while sailing on the Yangtze River at the Sh牌 River, upstream of Wujiang, six men in short clothing, speaking with a Guangxi accent, who had boarded the ship in Nanjing, suddenly claimed to be inspectors. Three of them drew pistols from their sleeves, one drew a Mauser pistol, one drew a small knife, and one drew two hand grenades. They first inspected the two soldiers traveling on the ship, fearing that they were carrying weapons and would resist. The two soldiers said, "We are not carrying guns. How dare you impersonate inspectors..." Before they could finish speaking, the bandits opened fire on the two soldiers, hitting their heads and abdomens. At the same time, the man with the hand grenades went to the cabin, threatening to stop the ship. They immediately began searching the passengers and the ship's accounting office, stealing all cash and jewelry. This lasted for more than twenty minutes. They then forced the ship to sail to the vicinity of Heshan Port on the south bank of the Yangtze River, where they went ashore with their loot and fled. The ship arrived in Wuhu at 7:00 PM. Upon receiving the report, the military and police agencies sent personnel to board the ship for investigation. The two wounded soldiers died en route due to their serious injuries. One was Zhu Xingyou, a squad leader from the 341st Regiment of the 171st Brigade of the 57th Division stationed in Wuhu, who was going to Nanjing to pick up his family. His wife was crying bitterly on the ship. The other's letters showed that he was a soldier named Li from the 2nd Teaching Division stationed in Jiaxing. It is reported that the passengers' losses totaled about 2,000 yuan. (22nd)</p>

<p>Proposals for the Railway Bureau's business conference. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau is scheduled to convene a business conference from January 5th to 9th, soliciting opinions from chambers of commerce in various counties and relevant industries in advance in order to gather ideas and broaden perspectives. The Wuxi Chamber of Commerce has nominated Cheng Jingtang and Tang Xinghai as representatives to attend. Yesterday, they also put forward five proposals: (1) Trains arriving at various stations must strictly adhere to the announced schedule to avoid delays and convenience passengers. (2) At prosperous stations along the line, such as Wujin and Wuxi for southbound trains, and Wuxi and Wujin for northbound trains, the number of third- and fourth-class carriages should be increased as appropriate, and attention should be paid to cleanliness and improvement. (3) Although passenger transport on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has been busy in recent years, freight transport is far less than before. Some goods that used to be transported by rail are now transported by ship. This is because, although there are regulations for loading and unloading, workers along the line often collude with each other to demand exorbitant fees. If their demands are not met, they often damage the goods or even steal them at will. Merchants cannot claim compensation and are unwilling to suffer losses, so they resort to shipping. Therefore, more freight cars should be provided at prosperous stations along the line, and strict rules should be established. If railway workers deliberately damage goods or steal them due to unmet demands, and merchants report and verify the facts, strict penalties should be imposed to protect merchants and expand freight transport. (4) Traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is becoming increasingly congested, and the original single track is far from sufficient. Recent delays are mostly caused by waiting for trains. A plan should be drawn up within a reasonable period of time to lay double tracks to avoid obstruction and facilitate transportation. (5) Please investigate the plan proposed by the former Municipal Preparatory Office to build the Wuxi-Wuqiao Railway, moving the freight station to Wuqiao to connect with the Be塘 market, which would be convenient for transportation by the Railway Bureau and development of the local area. The above five proposals were sent to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau yesterday for discussion at the meeting.</p>
<p>A man commits suicide by hanging due to oppression from his wife. Yang Chunsheng, a resident of Shiguqiao, Tangtou Township, in the Sixth District, was over thirty years old and worked as a crew member on a barge at the Yukang Yarn Factory. He had been married to his wife, Yang Shen, for more than ten years and had two sons and two daughters. In recent years, Chunsheng's income was not enough to cover expenses, so his wife Shen often quarreled with him. The other day, Chunsheng asked his wife for 2,000 yuan, but she refused and scolded him harshly, slapping him several times. Chunsheng, feeling humiliated, became disillusioned with life. He immediately came to the city, pawned his cotton robe for six yuan, spent four yuan on a haircut and meal, and used the rest to buy a hemp rope. He then walked back to his hometown and hanged himself in an empty room above Huachang Lane. A village woman who went inside to fetch firewood noticed that he was already dead. She immediately ran to tell his wife, Yang Shen. After hearing the news, she went and carried her husband Chunsheng home and bought a coffin for a hasty burial.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Zheng Wuchang's Creation of the Entire Number of Stroke Form Character Index (1) <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Recently, no fewer than dozens of new character indexing methods have been invented, all striving for simplicity. Among the more comparable methods that are generally popular are: (1) Character indexing using numbers; (2) Character indexing using stroke order. Although Arabic numerals are also commonly used, one has to recognize the strokes of the character, and also use numbers to remember the count. Using this indirect method is inevitably cumbersome, and one must have studied arithmetic beyond four digits to be able to apply it easily. As for talking about stroke order, it feels even more difficult, because people who do not recognize characters simply do not know where to start writing the character. Even those who are slightly familiar with stroke order may have different habits, and the order of strokes cannot be consistent. Therefore, using numbers and talking about stroke order is still not thinking from the perspective of the character indexing user. Moreover, there are actually nine distinct types of strokes in analyzing Chinese characters: (dot), (horizontal), (vertical), (撇), (curve) (strokes that are curved belong to this category), (fold) (strokes that turn and form acute angles belong to this category), (鉤), (捺), (　). Recently, people who use stroke count to index characters often intentionally reduce or combine the number of strokes, or merge several single strokes into a complex stroke, which feels completely without standard, causing confusion. I believe that character indexing methods needed by primary school students and ordinary households should at least (not use numbers), (not consider stroke order), and can be started for indexing without thinking. Although I dare not confidently say that the creation of the entire number of stroke form character index is very perfect, it can be said to be an "easy to index without learning" character indexing method. Now, I will disclose the simple explanation of the entire number of stroke form character index as follows, hoping that comrades at home and abroad will provide strict guidance and criticism.</p>
<p>(A) Count the entire number of strokes of the character to be indexed. Every turn in the stroke is counted as one stroke. One stroke counts as one stroke. For example,</p>
<p>(B) is counted as four strokes for horizontal-fold-horizontal-hook. (阡) is counted as eight strokes for horizontal-fold-curve-hook-vertical-徽-horizontal-vertical.</p>
<p>(　) is counted as seven strokes for horizontal-vertical-horizontal-vertical-horizontal-curve-hook. (酉) is counted as nine strokes for horizontal-vertical-horizontal-vertical-撇-vertical-horizontal-horizontal. (退) is counted as thirteen strokes for horizontal-vertical-horizontal-horizontal-vertical-　-撇-dot-dot-horizontal-vertical-捺.</p>
<p>(Note) (1) Several people have advocated counting each turn in the stroke as one stroke, but no one has ever defined the nine types of strokes as the basic strokes of Chinese characters.</p>
<p>(2) When counting, just count one, two, three, four according to the turning of the strokes, without having to recite the types of strokes and the stroke order.</p>
<p>(3) I randomly took more than 300 characters from the Chinese Character Dictionary published by Zhonghua Book Company, and asked four or five seven- or eight-year-old children who had just started school to count them individually, and then double-checked them, and there were no mistakes.</p>
<p>(4) It takes no more than ten minutes to count the total number of strokes of a Chinese character.</p>

<p>(Sent from the United States by Lu Erzhao, Songjiang)</p>
<p>(E) Most students take test scores as their lives. Foreign students like us come here to study, and of course, we take learning as the premise, which goes without saying. However, Japanese students study even harder, with the intention of sacrificing their lives for learning. They sleep at 2:00 AM every night and get up at 6:30 AM, and their test scores are indeed passing. However, they are not necessarily outstanding, mostly because their pronunciation is not accurate and there are occasional mistakes in listening to and recording lectures. I expect that this problem will be eliminated after a few months. Erzhao and three other Chinese students are all graduates of Shanghai schools, and there is no obstacle in terms of language. Except for physical education, the test scores of each subject are fortunately ranked in the top tier. Teachers and classmates all attach importance to them. The three of us secretly made an agreement, saying that studying abroad is for the sake of the country, and our test scores must not be weak, and we must not disgrace the country. This heart and this strength will never be stolen. However, the days ahead are long, and we must encourage each other. Among the American students, those who are agile and studious actually account for the majority. There are a very small number of students who like to be surprised by the outside world, and those with slightly weaker test scores are mostly crying and weeping, soaking their handkerchiefs with tears, the same as famous girls' schools in Shanghai. We can pass physical education, but swimming is like eating glutinous rice balls, and we get circled scores. The professor is initially lenient and forgives, which makes people feel ashamed, but there is really nothing we can do. The three of us will work hard to encourage ourselves and be persistent.</p>
<p>Attached is a glimpse of the American unemployment problem by a professor.</p>
<p>The unemployment problem is rampant in countries around the world. It is regarded as one of the most difficult problems in the political world. The United States naturally joins the world's hot spot and becomes chaotic. Erzhao read the American Labor Yearbook and saw that in 1927, the total number of non-agricultural workers in the United States was 32,695,000, and the number of unemployed was 2,055,000, accounting for 6.3%. Also, I saw in the newspaper that President Hoover asked the House Appropriations Committee to allocate US$150 million for unemployment relief funds. The current officials and people in the United States regard the unemployment problem as a task that needs to be solved urgently. Yesterday, taking advantage of a professor's break after class, I asked him about this problem. The professor told me that the United States is the country with the fastest progress in productivity and efficiency. Many labor-saving machines have been invented, and scientific management methods are complete. Whether it is manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, or mining, it is possible to reduce labor and produce more. People with special skills have unemployment problems. Also, he said that there are no tariff barriers between the states in the United States, the land and resources are abundant, the population is not large, the machines are precise and fast, and the products are abundant. Immigration is strictly prohibited, and workers are paid high wages. The general national standard of living is naturally increased. It is said that increased wages and general national progress and prosperity are all caused by our United States, and the sharp increase in the number of unemployed is also not a small disaster for the United States. It is currently urgent to find ways to provide relief, but it is not a fundamental solution. Erzhao urgently asked about the fundamental and long-term method. The professor sighed and said, "Let's postpone talking about other places and just talk about my family. The old woman who used to work for us had a weekly wage of gold. Now this woman has asked for a break from work for more than two weeks. The reason is that the monthly wage for maids is different, but the total is always no more than 40 or 50 yuan. The government gives unemployed workers at least two gold yuan per week. Most of the idle workers voluntarily become unemployed." Erzhao asked again, "What is a good method to solve this unsolvable problem?" Just as the evening bell rang, the professor excused himself and said, "Let's study next time."

After the opening ceremony, the chairman delivered an opening speech, saying, "The annual meeting of the Meteorological Society yesterday encountered heavy snow. Today, our association's annual meeting also happens to be blessed with clear skies. This is all a coincidence. The main purpose of meteorology is to study changes in weather, and rain and snow are the subjects of investigation. The most important task of astronomy is to observe the seven luminaries. The Astronomical Research Institute has recently acquired a new solar spectrograph. The clear weather today is a good opportunity for everyone to view it. In recent years, the domestic astronomical enterprise can be said to have developed with shame. The establishment of astronomical observatories and the establishment of astronomy departments in universities are often heard. This is a celebration for our party," etc. Next, the general secretary, Gao Jun, reported on the association's affairs, saying that the association's greatest achievements this year were: first, in addition to the yearbook, a monthly journal was added, which has been published on schedule every month since January of this year; second, the Variable Star Observation Committee was moved to Guangzhou and established earlier this spring, and began observation with excellent results. The chairman of the association, Zhang Yunqing, sent a report, which the chair will read. Finally, he reported on the storage and interest situation of the scholarship fund. After the report, the accountant, Li Feng, reported on the income and expenditure situation of this year's funds. Next, there was an academic lecture. First, member Zhang Yuzhe lectured on the special features of the variable star observation camera recently delivered to the Astronomical Research Institute. Member Gao Jun lectured on the structure and characteristics of the Hale solar spectroscope. After the lectures, members took turns visiting the instrument room for experimental viewing. At 12:00 noon, a group photo was taken, and then a banquet was held at the Gulou Restaurant. In the afternoon, a business meeting was held. First, the officers were re-elected.

<h3 id="e87">Nine District Party Headquarters' Declaration Regarding the Guanghua University Incident <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>(Kuomintang News Agency) The Nine District Party Headquarters of this city issued a declaration regarding the Guanghua University incident:</p>
<p>The declaration states: Tracing back to the May Thirtieth Incident, people across the nation deeply resented the brutality and tyranny of the imperialists, and the fact that church schools acted as their accomplices. Hence, the establishment of Guanghua University was intended to accommodate patriotic and nationalistic young people who sacrificed themselves for the nation. It was also meant to directly or indirectly oppose church schools acting as accomplices and the brutal, tyrannical imperialists. Guanghua's past cannot but be described as glorious, and the support of society cannot but be described as enthusiastic and responsible. Administrative personnel of Guanghua School should support this glorious history, promote it, and comfort the hopes of the association and the painstaking efforts of the students who have traveled far to study, without allowing it to be prematurely cut short or fall by the wayside. Unexpectedly, since Liao Shicheng, an important lackey of the Nationalist faction, became the principal, he has been colluding with others, occupying key positions, and treating those who are not members of the Nationalist faction as snakes and scorpions, and labeling them as "feudal remnants." Anyone who opposes the government or mocks the authorities is treated with deference, and those who are disreputable are treated as fathers and family members. Luo Longji and others, who usually advocate human rights and oppose the party, were able to seize the opportunity to be selected, and Fan Zhaocong, Hu Zuyin, and others, who repeatedly violated discipline and acted as accomplices in causing trouble, were able to swagger and jump around for a while. Now, we dare to report the process to our fellow compatriots. The Fifth Branch of this district is located within Guanghua University. Party member Fan Zhaocong repeatedly violated discipline and was absent from branch party member meetings. Standing Committee member Yang Shuchun questioned and warned him in accordance with the discipline. This is Fan Zhaocong's own fault, and he should accept it without resistance or dispute. Furthermore, it is not for non-party members to question or oppose, nor is it for Nationalist faction members of our party or communist bandits to participate or interfere. Unexpectedly, when the incident occurred, Fan Zhaocong dared to resist the sanctions of discipline and oppose the party. Hu Zuyin, who has always been against party doctrine, dared to come out and act as an accomplice in creating chaos. Liao Shicheng, who has always flaunted nationalism, once was a lackey of Sun Chuanfang of Dongren University and a supporter of the Five-Color Flag Alliance, insisted that Yang Shuchun was guilty of assault and insisted on expulsion in order to satisfy his selfish desire to exclude dissidents and remove comrades from our party. Although this association tried its best to negotiate, Yang Shuchun was still punished with demerits. His disregard for justice and interference in party affairs has reached this point. This is also the origin of what Guanghua faculty and staff call "self-defense" for the Fifth Branch of the Nine Districts' Standing Committee member violating school rules. When the Guanghua-Fudan football match dispute arose, Yang Shuchun, as a Standing Committee member of the branch, was resented. Luo Longji, Liao Shicheng, and others, who advocated freedom of speech and colluded with each other, did not hesitate to reveal their hideousness and suppressed and prohibited opinions that upheld justice. Declarations and notices of our party were arbitrarily confiscated, and non-factional students were arbitrarily suppressed. If there was any negotiation, it was called disrespect for teachers, roaring provocations, and sowing discord. Under today's blue sky and white sun flag, such absurd facts exist. In Guanghua, which has a glorious revolutionary history, there is such a stain. This is what our party comrades cannot tolerate, and it is also what society does not approve of. On the contrary, it brings shame to Guanghua and ridicule to the Johnnies. On the occasion of the anniversary of the communist uprising in Gengzhou, the association received a central order to strictly prevent communist activities and disturbances. On the night of the tenth, Guanghua students Xing Daocheng, Hu Zuyin, and others distributed communist slogans and leaflets. After the efforts of party comrades Yang Shuchun, Xu Jiying, and others to investigate, they were caught on the spot with witnesses and irrefutable evidence. Even if Su Zhang had the gift of the gab, he could not wash away the irrefutable evidence. Liao Shicheng, Luo Longji, and others, because they were members of the private party, did not hesitate to deceive society and reverse right and wrong in order to allow their private party to escape the law. They falsely accused Yang Shuchun of gathering a crowd to intimidate (officer Yuan of the Third Station of the Sixth District requested to take him to the station several times, but the school authorities refused) in order to escape criticism from society. Their actions were cunning and their plans were clever, but one hand cannot cover up all the facts. This was still not enough to quell their desire to exclude dissidents and eliminate comrades from our party. They held a faculty and staff meeting to expel Yang Shuchun and remove what they considered a thorn in their side. Their hearts and actions can be said to be poisonous. How can it be said that party rights are respected when there is such a fact of despising our party and destroying our party under the implementation of party doctrine education? Moreover, the promotion of party doctrine education was decided at the Third Plenary Session, and orders were issued by party and government organs. Yet, Guanghua University, which has a revolutionary history, disregards party doctrine courses. The weekly commemoration of the Premier should be held on time, and party and government organs have ordered all institutions to follow suit. However, the person in charge of Guanghua dared to ignore national laws and regulations, and slandered Mr. Shi Cheng's theory of "knowing and acting as one" to poison the youth and mislead society. Moreover, he secretly instructed his private party to arbitrarily distribute slogans such as "Down with the Kuomintang! Long live nationalism!" All means to harm the party and the country and create reaction were used to their full extent. The colleagues of this association will lead all comrades in the district to fight against this evil force with all their strength. In addition to reporting the denial of Yang Shuchun's expulsion and the severe punishment of the petty thieves who shielded the reactionaries to the higher authorities and the central government, it is also hoped that the higher-level party headquarters and people from all walks of life will unanimously condemn them to eradicate this reactionary force that endangers the school and society. This declaration is hereby made. Please enlighten us. Executive Committee of the Ninth District of the Shanghai Special City Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>

<p>This Session Held in Shanghai</p>
<p>The National Regional Football Tournament was hosted by North China last session and held separately in Tianjin and Beijing. South China did not participate due to the cold weather, and only the Northeast and North China regions competed, which was a pity. This session is hosted by East China in Shanghai. The transportation and climate are both suitable. South China has sent a letter to the association to inquire, and the National Sports Association is also corresponding with the North and South to discuss the competition date, which is scheduled to be held in mid-February next year. The date will be finalized once replies are received from all parties.</p>

<p>Among the Chinese people, the most economically minded are the people of Jiangbei. If all Chinese people were like the people of Jiangbei, they would definitely overthrow the Japanese.</p>
<p>People only seek food, which is not easy, so they neglect the health benefits of air. They do not know that diet can harm health and that breathing can prolong life.</p>
<p>Lao Tzu said, "Subtle, subtle, it seems to exist." Zhuang Tzu said, "The breath of the perfected man comes from his heels." These two phrases are the most profound in the way of breathing and nourishing life.</p>
<p>Beauty has no standard at first, and there is nothing that can be measured or estimated. As the saying goes, "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder." It is true.</p>
<p>It is common to see wealthy people who love goods and are greedy, leading to the ruin of their families. You must know that after a hundred years of life, even if you are buried in a golden coffin, it is difficult to avoid the danger of exhumation. What is the point?</p>
<p>A maxim is a prediction, so a gentleman does not believe in predictions but believes in maxims.</p>
<p>Air is of the greatest importance to people. Wind and rain are the flow of air. Heat and cold are the changes in air pressure. Qi in reverse causes anger, qi in stagnation causes sorrow, qi in ascent causes panting, qi in stagnation causes sickness. People's joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are all like shadows that follow the form of qi. Therefore, a gentleman must nourish qi.</p>
<p>A person's forehead lines are like the tree rings of a tree. Botanists look at the tree rings of a tree to determine the tree's age, so looking at the number of forehead lines of people is enough to estimate the length of their life.</p>
<p>Yang Xingfo said that Chinese scholars can be divided into three stages: the youth stage is called the patriot, the prime of life stage is called the celebrity, and the old age stage is called the layman. In fact, the youth must embrace the ambition of a layman and act as a patriot, and the old age must have the ambition of a patriot and act as a layman. It is not without benefit to the country, but celebrities, no matter what stage they are in, must never be allowed to do it.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Snippets of Jiangxi Bandit Disaster Huang Yingdai <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Jiangxi Province has been plagued by communist bandits recently, and the people are unable to make a living. Therefore, when Chairman Chiang made his tour, he first went to the Jiujiang and Nanchang areas. Yesterday, a guest returned to Shanghai from Jiujiang. After meeting and talking, I was informed of the recent situation in Jiangxi amidst the banditry. I am eager to record a few points to enrich this discussion. The market situation is peaceful. Although there are many rumors in the Jiujiang and Nanchang areas recently, the market situation is still good, and it has indeed improved in the past few weeks. There are enough troops in the city, and the communist bandits dare not come to commit crimes. However, Ji'an, which is three or four hundred miles away from Nanchang, was occupied by bandits for fourteen days. They looted, burned, and did all kinds of evil. The number of deaths and injuries was as high as thousands. However, the number of houses burned down was limited, and the losses of the church were not significant.</p>
<p>The Bandit's Momentum is Rampant. According to news from Nanchang, when the communist bandits were at the height of their power, they launched a large-scale attack and occupied many cities. However, the losses of the people in the places they went were not significant, and the churches were not seen to be burned down. As for the Christian and Roman churches in Nanchang, they suffered a lot of damage, and there were many priests who were kidnapped. Later, several people escaped from the bandit's den and were able to be reborn, which was the greatest good fortune in the midst of misfortune.</p>
<p>Strict Defense. In recent days, the defenses inside Nanchang city have been quite strict. Iron wire fences and defensive objects have been set up on the thoroughfares. There are plenty of troops, and the police patrol day and night to ensure safety. Therefore, the British and American priests who went to other places to take refuge have returned to the city one after another. Jiujiang and Guling are also quite peaceful, and it is believed that there will be no accidents.</p>
<p>General Prices. As far as the prices in Nanchang are concerned, the price of rice has never been so low. Currently, it is only five to eight yuan per picul, which is about 130 catties. Most other goods have risen sharply, such as food, leather goods, clothing, fuel, etc., which are all higher than usual.</p>
<p>A Further Account of the Xiong Family, an Old Student of Chih Chih.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I read "Free Talk" by Mr. Yun Xun, which described an old student of Chih Chih with some inaccuracies. I studied at Chih Chih and was in the same grade and department as this old student, so I know more details. I would like to add some details. This old student's surname is Lu, his name is Hongkun, and he is from Henan (the name of the county has been forgotten). He is over fifty years old and his beard is nearly half a foot long. Those who do not know him suspect that he is a teacher. When a classmate asked him how old he was, he replied that he was forty. He studied in the first grade of the political science department of the Faculty of Law and Politics at Chih Chih. Last year, he was at the National University of the Republic of China in Beijing. This semester, he moved to Shanghai to Chih Chih to take refuge from the Northern Expedition of the Central Army. He is not good at sports and likes to play chess at Dongxinqiao. Because of his age, he was appointed as the class leader, and his classmates were happy to associate with him and elected him as a member of the class meeting preparation committee and a representative to the student union. (Que Chou)</p>
<p>Usually, there have been many price increases. The wages of workers, except for those with contracts or special circumstances, are higher than in the past.</p>
<p>General Transportation Situation. The business in Jiujiang is still very lively, and the transportation of railway passengers and luggage in Nanchang is particularly busy. However, the water level in the Yangtze River is shallow, which will make navigation inconvenient. Construction projects in Nanchang city are underway, roads are being widened, and streets are being rebuilt. The number of automobiles and rickshaws has also increased. Therefore, although it is currently in an unfortunate state, it can be asserted that it will develop in the future.</p>

<p>Since the New World added a Literary Tiger Society in Yashu Hall last month, it has been able to attract the interest of tourists. The person in charge of the society is Mr. Xi Yanzi, a senior in the literary and art circles of Shanghai. A few days ago, Mr. Yan invited many colleagues to a meal at Gongdelin to discuss the affairs of the society. Fourteen people were nominated on the spot, two of whom were on duty every night, taking turns in order, week after week. All mystery strips that are not solved on the first day will not be re-suspended on the second day. After this reform, the atmosphere is new, and there are more and more people standing in front of the lights every night, frowning and thinking hard. I was previously entrusted by Mr. Yan to write more than a hundred mystery strips, but due to my limited knowledge, most of them are shallow. Often, before the paste has dried, they are revealed by others. Now, I have selected a few of them as follows, and I would like to ask my colleagues for correction.</p>

<p>Burmese women's wisdom, discussion, and influence in society far exceed those of our country. Those in the markets are mostly literate and numerate, having received a considerable amount of education and refined appearance. Even the most well-educated women in our country cannot compare. Moreover, they are rich in experience in handling social affairs, composed and generous, absolutely unlike the shyness of Chinese women. Their men, already transformed by the custom of monasticism, are no longer as barbaric as men of other countries. Therefore, women more easily engage in activities and develop their talents. Could it be that the monastic system is also a useful tool for softening men and achieving a world of universal harmony? The English scholar Bertrand Russell said, "Why not use the three-year compulsory military service to open rivers and repair projects?" I say it would be better to use it to make Burmese men become monks; is that the way to achieve a world of universal harmony? Some say Burmese men have already been subdued, and there is hardly any case of men daring to rape women. Others say that is not entirely true. I dare not make a definitive judgment.</p>
<p>Burmese women are also quite willing to marry Chinese men because they suffer from running their own businesses and wish to rely on husbands to alleviate their direct labor. Those women with property are also willing, as a rule, to share part of their family property with their husbands. Therefore, the wealth of middle-class men often relies on the help of marrying Burmese wives. However, one must know that their marriage and divorce are extremely free; if they don't get along, they divorce without any hesitation. Also, if a man marries a woman, he often becomes a live-in son-in-law, having to bear the living expenses of the woman's entire family. This refers to those without property.</p>
<p>Burmese people of both sexes love singing and dancing. All customs of primitive peoples have this freedom, but as etiquette and doctrine arose, this custom gradually diminished. Now, the people of Guangxi are still close to this. The attitude of men and women displayed in the portraits seen on the streets is very different from that in other countries. Sometimes, men lie in women's arms as guests, while women act as masters. One can know their social customs.</p>
<p>The custom of Indian women is to wear gold and silver rings on their noses, ears, and feet. Burmese women are generally ignorant of all this, more or less the same as Chinese women. Those Chinese women dressed as Burmese cannot distinguish the authenticity. Also, Indian women have long faces and high noses, with a slightly dark complexion. Burmese women are white and delicate, due to different races and bloodlines.</p>

<p>Short news: The students of Changming Art Special School usually study diligently, so they agreed to hold a joint meeting before the annual holiday and made preparations in advance by setting up a stage and a screen. From 6 PM the previous afternoon, they performed entertainment programs. With drums beating in unison and songs following, the atmosphere of the quiet study area suddenly changed. The programs included art, dance, new dramas, Beijing operas, Kunqu operas, national skills, Chaozhou tunes, big drums, and ancient zithers.

<p>Chapter Sixteen: Cui Xiu Earnestly Asks for Words from the Teacher, and the Heroine Generously Discusses Military Affairs at a Brothel Banquet.</p>
<p>The next day, Zuo Shichen got up early and went to the Commercial Press to buy many elementary Chinese language textbooks. According to them, she had already read the first and second books, so this time they could start with the third book, as well as calligraphy templates, brushes, and paper, as well as "Children's World," "Children's Readings," etc., totaling a large bundle, just like sending a child to school. At this time, it was the beginning of the second month of the old lunar calendar, and the schools were also starting the spring semester. Male and female students were crowded in front of the counters of the two major bookstores, all matching their books. Zuo Shichen was also crowded among them. A receptionist in the bookstore recognized Zuo Shichen and came to greet him, saying, "Oh, Mr. Zuo, are you also here to buy books? Is Mr. Zuo teaching at that school now, or are these textbooks for the young lady and young master in your family?" Zuo Shichen's face turned red when he was asked, and he had to answer vaguely. The receptionist was very enthusiastic and quickly said to a clerk, "This is Mr. Zuo Shichen. Please match his books first to save Mr. Zuo from waiting for a long time." Zuo Shichen also said, "Please do, please do," but the receptionist went to greet other people. Zuo Shichen carried a large package of books to the small garden. It was only four or five o'clock in the afternoon, and Luyi's mother had not yet come out of her small mansion. Luyi was also wearing a casual suit of clothes with a light blue bamboo cloth vest over it. They called it a dressing-up jacket. Although her hair was already done, she had not yet removed the jacket. The sleeves of the jacket were turned out over a blue striped flannel short shirt. Seeing Zuo Shichen carrying a paper package, she said, "Have the books been bought?" She eagerly untied it and looked at it, just like a child. She was very happy to see the pictures in "Children's World" and other things. She looked at this one and then at that one, greatly enjoying the pleasure of a child getting a cake. Seeing a picture of someone playing a ball, she said, "I used to have a ball, and I could pat it more than a hundred times. Now that ball is broken." Zuo Shichen said, "That's easy. Next time I go to the Commercial Press, I'll give you a big ball." Seeing a picture of someone playing the harmonium and singing, she said, "I used to go to a girls' school for three months, and they also had a singing class. I still remember the singing teacher teaching us a song about letting go of the feet, singing something (bound feet are the most bitter, bitter from childhood to old age). However, those song collections did not distinguish between men and women. There was also something (a boy's first ambition is high, to make meritorious service in battle in the future). We were very reluctant to sing those many songs, saying that they were sung by male students, but the teacher said that there were also female revolutionaries singing during the revolution the year before. Soon there will be equal rights for men and women. Making meritorious service in battle cannot be left to men alone. Could it be that women will really be taught to fight in the future?"</p>

<h3 id="e127">Financial Gold Standard Resurges Wildly <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Small Dips, Big Rises, Soaring Twelve Taels</p>
<p>Main Process: Yesterday, December 23, the gold standard suddenly soared, breaking through the 660 tael mark. The rise of over ten taels was a true small dip and large rebound. The process was rapid, but the volatile power was not small, and the waves were very dramatic, with three or four taels of twists and turns. Foreign exchange seemed tight, and the quoted price was raised by one grade in the morning, and then repeatedly reduced by one grade. On average, the gold price in the morning market had a difference of ten taels. Transactions were mostly bought in. Taikang, Runxin, Hengfu, Xingyong, etc., all bought in smoothly. Yuanmao, Yongcheng, and Fengyong all sold out. The overseas silver market did indeed rise, but because the United States still had the intention to suppress, the gold price only fell slightly. It was also heard that a bank closure had occurred in the United States, so people's hearts were firm and the market was eager to advance, with an atmosphere of flying colors. Xiang frequently jumped ten taels, and the rise and fall were unpredictable, hovering around sixty taels. In reality, people's hearts were not without uncertainty, almost becoming a state of bewilderment. After the market, the cashier's opinions differed. At the beginning of the opening, the price dropped, presumably because it was heard after the closing at noon that Datong Bank had the intention of buying spot goods, so the market was cheered up. Afterwards, it advanced and retreated, with a count of three taels. However, the state of shaking was difficult to suppress. It once rose to between 666 taels. The exchange rate continued to shrink. It is expected that the big strips will be lower this morning. A glimpse of the morning market: The February opening in the morning was 653 taels, a reduction of one tael (the gross profit increased from fifty taels to fifty-three taels, and there were many buyers). Big strips were as long as sixteen sevenths, forward added sixteen fifths, silver price added three fourths, British-English exchange rate rose thirty-two firsts, and private telegram silver price was also very high at 6875, but the gold market did not have any influence, because the European market was still softening. The buyers in the market, Zhifeng Yongyu Da, etc., were active. It was also heard that there were bank failures in the United States and other accidents, and the gold price suddenly rose more than five taels. When the shilling was announced, it was fifty-eight taels. Although the listed price rose 25 cents, the daily gold price dropped 1.125 cents, but it was not moved. The buying side was eager and the interior was not loose. March British gold Datong and others came out 1.54375, Korea came out US$35.25, and then fell back a few cents. The price passed 57 taels and 1 cent. The price rose sharply because Yuanheng, Yu Da, Yuchang, Taikang, Run and others came to buy, and the shilling turned strong. March was settled at 1.5275, so the gold price jumped more than four taels. Ten points later, the British gold suddenly changed and shrank 125 US$0.25. The daily gold price increased by 1 point. At 10:20, it rose to 61 taels and a half. Suddenly, Dadecheng and Yuanmao Yong came to sell. After only ten minutes, it plunged four taels, with the price at 56 taels and 8 cents. After entering the market, there were two taels. After 11 o'clock, Taiheng, Yuanfu, Xingyong, and Taoshun came to compete for purchases, and the bank ate up British gold at 1.54275 in March. After that, it was tied to 1.53125, and the gold price jumped again. Two taels were reached at 11:20, reaching 62 taels. After that, it was erratic, and there were two taels of circulation. At 11:30, Chenfeng Yong and others tended to sell, and it plummeted more than three taels, with the price at 58 taels and 23 cents. The market closed at 8 taels and 9 cents. Suddenly, it was heard that the bank had taken in cash, and people's hearts were firm and went long again by two taels. The price was 61 taels, which was really overwhelming. The initial price was 681 taels and 6 cents, but the daily gold price was lowered by 0.125 cents, a total of 24 taels, and then changed to 686 taels and 4 cents, which was lowered by a small amount of 25 taels to 29 taels.</p>
<p>Evening Market Summary: The aftermarket opened at 63 taels and 2 cents, which was the surplus wind after the noon closing. Zhifeng Yong and others bought in, and it added up to 4 taels and 8 cents. Suddenly, it was suppressed to 3 taels and 2 cents. Before long, the shilling changed and shrunk 125 US$0.25, the daily gold price added 0.125 cents, and the Indian exchange rate reported shrinkage. At 2:40, it reached 66 taels. After that, in February, British gold banks mutually made a 1.53125, and the market sentiment was sensitive. Zhifeng Yong Xieyu Chenfeng Yong Yuanmao Yong and others tended to sell, and a storm of rain fell by more than 3 taels. At 3:30, the price plummeted to 62 taels and 6 cents. The price was suddenly raised by more than 3 taels by the influx of goods. Around 4 o'clock, the price was 66 taels and 2 cents. Yongfeng Yuanmao Yong and Taichang came to sell again, and the price depreciated by 2 taels, with the price at 64 taels. Generally, shorts were especially small. The price was recorded, and both retail investors and the table were high by 2 taels. At 4:30, the market closed at 66 taels, an increase of 12 taels compared to the previous day. After the market, the market was made to 5 and a half taels again. The highest price of the day was 66 taels and 2 cents, and the lowest price was 52 and a half taels, with a difference of 13 taels and 7 cents. The morning market of goods was 53 taels, the noon closing was 61 taels, the afternoon was 3 taels and 2 cents, and the market closed at 5 and a half taels.

December has been cleared and no water replenishment is counted at 56 taels, and 61 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Trading Status: Fellow traders such as Zhifeng Yong Dadecheng Yuanmao Yong Yongfeng Wanxing had quite different ins and outs.

From New Year's Day to the 2nd, the Chinese and foreign banks are closed for three days, so the Gold Exchange will also be closed for three days.</p>

<p>The yarn market is slightly flat due to the implementation of the factory tax on January 1. Due to the sudden rush of the recent goods, customers are unable to ship the goods, and the people's hearts are softened. The market is loose, and the sellers take the opportunity to sell. The pressure of the Japanese and Chao gangs is increasing, so the market has fallen by one or two. However, those outside the industry have a strong desire to go long due to the dry bottom. The actual sales in the market are still smooth. In terms of the bottom goods, the yarn market still has no active rise. However, the bottom is lower and it is not easy to fall too much. The decline in the human standard mid-month is slightly stronger. The opening of the human standard market is tired due to the American cotton market. The market is still rising. The various falls are 3, 6, 8, and 9 cents. In the afternoon, the Chao gang dumped, and the market was loose. The near-term falls were 3, 4, 5, and 7 cents. The far-month stalks were firm and rose 1-2 cents. The total transaction statistics for the day were 21,200 bales. It was found that the purchase of Heshen was 1,050 bales, Xincheng was 1,100 bales, Tiancheng was 650 bales, and the remaining 4-500 bales were sold by Gongtai at 1,100 bales, Dafeng at 1,650 bales, and Shenyu at 1,300 bales. The remaining 2-300 bales, the closing price of the human standard is recorded on the left</p>

<p>The cotton market fell slightly due to the tired state of the American cotton, which led to a calm mood. The actual sales in the market were light. Due to the shipment of 2,000 loads of fire machine flowers by the Ningbo Gang long month, the situation was tighter, and the pulling force was stronger. He never loosened his grip.</p>
<p>The Han Standard fell 2 cents. The Han Standard opened in the pre-market, and the market was still firm. The situation was slightly better with 2-3 discs. The result of the slight decline in the yarn market was that each month fell 2 cents and a half. In the afternoon, the market was still strong, and each month was flat. The total transaction statistics for the day were 40,000. It was found that Maoji sold 4,400 loads, Gongtai 2,700 loads, Tiancheng 2,400 loads, and the remaining 1-2,000 loads.

<h3 id="e136">Grain and Rice Market Declines Gradually <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, at over forty locations on Luli Road and the main street, sales remained slow. The route for North Japonica rice was slightly more active, but focused on high-quality goods, so the price of high Japonica rice gradually fell by about two jiao. The market remained sluggish. Top Grade Opened at 13 Yuan 6 Jiao. Subgrade only 12 Yuan. Thin Rice arrivals were slightly scarce, and sales were unpromising, recovering briefly by a jiao. Semi-early rice was slightly soft. Sheep Xian rice trended towards flat, but below average quality was reduced by one jiao. Market conditions: High prices were stable, subgrade was sluggish. Du Jian and Bu Jian buying interest was weak. Source gradually lowered prices by one jiao, turning cloudy. While arrivals were not many, guest sales and liquor demand were both weak, so prices remained soft. Top grade changed, opening at 13 Yuan 3 Jiao.</p>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, over twenty boats arrived from downriver. Sales from all directions were sluggish. Changbang and Sutong brands of machine-milled Japonica rice continued to see downstream stores and stomachs taking a wait-and-see approach, because the end of the year was near, and importers were consolidating, leading to reduced transactions. The overall market fell by 1-2 jiao. The Nambang early rice situation was also slow; with sales remaining sluggish, sellers became more willing to sell, and prices gradually fell by half a jiao. Sheep Du Xian sales were unpromising. High-quality goods were rare, so the market was stable. Subgrade sales were weak, slightly down. Ordinary grades were turning cloudy with few patrons, and prices were down a small jiao. Throughout the day, both the North and South markets continued to be uniformly sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Flour and Wheat Market Fell Sharply, Then Recovered Slightly <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices for all months again showed a sharp decline. The reported price for foreign wheat for distant futures in Chicago also fell by a small seven jiao, and Canadian near and far futures each fell by five jiao, with recent futures actually shrinking to just over five jiao, again hitting a record low. Therefore, after the price drop, people inside and outside the industry were very worried. (Rumor on the market was that factories were continuing to order three yuan worth of foreign wheat). The opening price immediately fell sharply. This month's price was lowest at 2.0925 taels. January's price was 2.065 taels, February's was 2.0525 taels, March's was 2.075 taels, April's was 2.08 taels, and May's was 2.09 taels, falling 1.1325 taels from the previous day's closing price for recent futures and falling 1.0 fen for distant futures. However, since the second round, due to outsiders short selling frantically, the market recovered. When the afternoon session opened, the market seemed slightly stable because short sellers were still covering, but in general, the decline was still difficult to reverse. As a result, this month's price was down a small 0.075 tael from the previous day. January to March was down a small 0.015 tael, and April and May were down a small 0.0125 tael.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning, prices for foreign wheat continued to fall by 0.5-0.7 jiao, causing people to become agitated again. The lowest price for January and February was 4.08 taels. March and April were 4.09 taels, and May was 4.11 taels. Because short sellers were still quiet, the market did not see a sharp change. When the afternoon session opened, the Shanghai-Ningbo and Shaoxing gangs had to close their positions due to the end of the year, and because they were eager to cover their short positions, the market improved slightly, increasing by 0.05-0.06 tael from the lowest price. As a result, January was unchanged, February was down a small 0.01 tael, March and April were unchanged, and May was down a small 0.01 tael. The spot wheat market was still sluggish. Only the opening price for 2,000 packages of wheat from Daoren Bridge was 3.06 taels, handled by Huafeng.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Sugar Market Opens with 2,000 Bags of Cuban Raw Sugar <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market: According to news from the production areas, Cuban spot sugar prices were unchanged. New York sugar futures for December rose by 0.06 yuan, and March of next year fell by 0.01 yuan. Other months were unchanged. Java spot and futures prices were also unchanged. The market was gradually enlivened by the high exchange rate outside the Public Association market. The buying interest for Dutch sugar #24 Coarse Sand White was slightly strong, with over a thousand bags traded at a price of 8.4 taels. The market was still stable. #20 Medium Sand White was 7.75 taels, with a shortage of sellers, quoting 7.8 taels. #8 Raw Red was 7.15 taels.  Brand was 7.4 taels. The market was slightly up compared to the usual sugar market. Z Mark was 8.6 taels to 8.625 taels. YT Mark was 8.4 taels. YRO Mark was 7.9 taels. YP Mark was 8.875 taels to 8.9 taels. Meiji YP Mark was 8.925 taels. J Mark was 9.2 taels. The market was very brisk. The market for brand goods: The Chinese product Tongshou Bingyu Chun brand opened up, rising to 6.6 taels, but demand was very sparse, and the market was very sluggish. Huaxin opened for sale 2,000 bags of Cuban raw sugar at a price of 7.1 taels. These were purchased by local factories for use in refining ice flower and green raw materials.</p>

<p>The lowest price for wood ear mushroom in the previous market was 83-84 taels. Recently, with the conclusion period extended to January 15, sentiment suddenly turned upward. Goods from Malanping are now gradually rising to 93 taels, an increase of nearly two in relation to the lowest price. Dealers are selling at 95 taels, with a flourishing trend. Other miscellaneous goods are also rising with the trend, with tight supplies.</p>

<p>This year, the cost of white tung oil in the production areas is high. Merchants in Hanzhou are unwilling to sell. Although the sales in foreign firms are quiet, because futures are being settled, the need for spot goods is also strong. The external market is rising sharply. Shenglian and Anli have already opened sales at 18 taels according to foreign regulations, with 100 tons traded. Xiang Tung dealer prices have been hyped up to 17.2 taels. The internal market is also following, with Chunyuan and other brands being wholesaled at 16.6 taels. However, because shipments from downstream are continuing to arrive in Hanzhou, people are inevitably nervous. Sichuan dealers are currently opening prices at 98 taels, and dealer sales are opening at 104 taels for general goods and 102 taels for rice heart. Currently, because the end of the year is approaching, foreign firms lack buying interest, and domestic sales are also trending towards stagnation. The market is flat and uneventful.</p>

<p>Local defense forces in Sichuan province are adding surcharges to import and export goods. Yellow and white silk ends exported from Mianzhou, Tongzhou, and other places must all be taxed, resulting in increased costs. Recently, overseas economies have been unstable, and silk end factory sales in Lyon, Marseille, and other places have been sluggish, with prices coming in surprisingly low. General Shanghai merchants are thinking of suppressing prices and hoarding cocoon silk, raw silk handkerchiefs, etc. Although French firms have interest, they are opening prices even lower. Chinese merchants are losing too much, with each dan losing over ten taels to forty or fifty taels. It is difficult to sell, and the market is stagnant, with no one knowing the cost.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market at foreign firms in this port: the Zhenmei green tea from Luzhuang was slightly active. Qiahe, Jinlong, Duddell, and other firms all had some buying interest. Top-grade goods opened at 118 taels, and medium-grade goods sold from 50 taels to 78 taels, about 20 taels lower than before. There were also scattered transactions of pearl tea, Xiumei, etc., with no change in selling prices. However, the Gungxi item is currently unable to sell well due to the unrest in Persia and Turkey. Yesterday, the Jinlong foreign firm in the Qimen black tea market bought over 300 boxes, with sales from 31 taels to 34 taels. The market price is extremely low.</p>

All the spun silks have been shipped to Shanghai in batches. Yesterday, 55 pieces of white factory silk from Zhenyi, Jinshuang, and other brands were shipped to Shanghai to prepare for the end-of-month settlement with foreign firms.</p>

<p>In recent months, the market price of white coal has been slightly loose due to the unusually large number of Shanxi coal arrivals this year. Until the recent sudden cold weather in this port, the sales of coal stoves in coal shops have greatly increased, and the market has become extremely crowded as a result. Dealer prices are firm. Yesterday, the market sold Qiqi white coal for 19.75 taels per ton, Shanxi white coal for 19.5 taels, and Mark white coal for 18.25 taels.</p>

<p>City Government: The City Government of this city has formulated several programs to promote National Calendar New Year entertainment and various rituals, which are divided and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Notice to the National Government: In order to promote the national calendar, the abolition of the old calendar has been repeatedly ordered to the whole country. All of our citizens should absolutely follow it. The citizens of this city were the first to follow the national calendar, but there are still a few people who inevitably continue to use the old calendar. Now that the 19th year is about to end, the new year is already in sight. In order to promote the interest of citizens in promoting the national calendar New Year, this government has specifically stipulated the following measures:</p>
<p>Rituals: (1) All kinds of rituals and entertainments used by the people around the old calendar New Year, such as New Year greetings, group worship, spring banquets, lantern viewing, ribbon tying, and pasting Spring Festival couplets, shall be moved to the vicinity of the National Calendar New Year. (2) New Year's holidays are from January 1st to 4th, and the 5th is the opening day for stores. If the original holidays are insufficient or more than this number, those who do not open on this day may transfer them to the corresponding date of the National Calendar. However, they must not use the Spring Festival or other names to close down at the end of the old calendar year. (3) If there are conventions such as double pay and annual dividends for the business community at the end of the year, they shall be changed to the National Calendar. (4) The civil habit of major cleaning at the end of the old year should be moved to the winter cleaning program on December 15th of the National Calendar. The above-mentioned measures have been issued by this government and notified to the affiliated organizations to be followed. It is hoped that all citizens will implement them consistently in order to comply with the law and achieve the same enjoyment. Attached is the family celebration ceremony for New Year's Eve and New Year's Day: New Year's Eve is a memorial to ancestors. The family gathers with incense and flowers to worship and hang ancestral portraits in the central hall. The memorial ceremony is as follows: (1) Stand at attention. (2) Pay tribute to the ancestors. (3) The head of the family offers flowers. (4) Report (explain the meaning of the memorial, let them know what has been gained in the past year, and point out the ancestral portraits and narrate their teachings and anecdotes that are sufficient to be cautionary).

The discussion decided: (1) Starting from December 28th, each district's regular lecture hall should lecture on the meaning of promoting the National Calendar (if there is no regular lecture hall, then select a suitable location to hold it). (2) The preparatory committee will hold lectures on promoting the National Calendar for three days from December 28th, 29th, and 30th.

(6) The regular publications of each district should publish New Year special editions. (The rest of the case is omitted.)</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued an order to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that the measures for promoting the National Calendar and New Year's holidays have been announced in the City Government's 205th bulletin, and the Bureau and the City Party Headquarters have repeatedly stipulated the disposal measures for unauthorized business closures during the Old Calendar New Year in Bulletins No. 4684 and No. 5096, requiring both labor and capital in industrial and commercial factories to abide by them. The Central Standing Committee has also resolved that all industries must not take holidays during the Old Calendar New Year. According to reports, industry associations such as the money industry and banks have decided to close for five or two days from February 16th to 20th of the 20th year as the final accounting period. Financial institutions are the hub of all industries. Once the market is closed, all industries will inevitably take a break. At that time, it is appropriate to pretend to be using the old calendar under the guise of the end of the year, hindering the promotion of the National Calendar. This Bureau cannot be lenient in enforcing government orders. It is hereby ordered that the Association immediately inform all colleagues to abide by them, and do not take holidays at the end of the old calendar year under the guise of causing disputes.</p>

<p>Municipal Public Utilities Bureau Sends Personnel to Supervise</p>
<p>Official Trial Results Satisfactory</p>
<p>For many years, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company has purchased electricity from the Electricity Department of the former Public Concession Bureau and today's Shanghai Power Company and resold it. In order to recover profit rights, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau urged the company to prepare and implement a plan to build its own power plant at Jian Songqiao. Construction of the factory building began in September of the 17th year and included a boiler room, power generation room, management room, switch room, and water intake room. The boilers and machines were purchased from the Czech Skoda factory and installed by them. Installation began in March of the 18th year and was completed in June of the 19th year. However, the trial procedures were complicated and unusual, so electricity has not been formally generated. Formal trials were held on the 18th and 19th of this month. The Public Utilities Bureau sent technical personnel in charge to the site to monitor the No. 1 and No. 2 steam turbine generators. After load testing, speed variation rate testing, and emergency safety valve testing, engineers from the company and the manufacturer were cautious in their work, and the results were quite satisfactory. This kind of formal motor test under the supervision of the official government is still an innovation in China. It is said that the company is now scheduled to formally generate electricity today (the 24th) in the power supply area of the Jiyang Bridge Main Transformer Station, but the power must be turned off for ten minutes during the current exchange period.</p>

<p>Wuhu Landing Site Under Yijishan</p>
<p>In order to expand business, China Aviation Corporation has established a station for landing in Wuhu. It is heard that this has already been put into practice yesterday. The temporary office in Wuhu is temporarily located in the China Travel Agency in Yangmatou, and the landing point is under Yijishan on the riverbank. The site has been arranged by the company's engineers and has been equipped with buoys. However, because there is no wharf, when the plane lands, clerk Zhou Zhendong will take a sampan to the riverbank to wait for the reception of mail and the disembarkation of passengers. Yesterday morning, the plane flew from Shanghai to Wuhu without passengers, only two envelopes of mail (about four pounds). In the afternoon, the flight from Wuhu to Beijing only had passenger Cui Youzhen, a staff member of the Ministry of Military Affairs.

<h3 id="e151">Gao Shuo Files Arbitration Award in the Jinliyuan Case <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Declares Not Being Restricted by the French Side in Any Way</p>
<p>China Merchants Bureau Has Perpetual Lease Right with Special Permission</p>
<p>Due to the mediation relationship in the Jinliyuan Wharf case of the China Merchants Bureau, the French Consul General Mr. Gangerin requested the China Merchants Bureau to submit the arbitration award as soon as possible. The China Merchants Bureau was afraid of enforcement problems and replied with a refusal. Later, the French Consul General entrusted Mr. Du Yuesheng to explain the good intentions and guaranteed that it would never be enforced. The China Merchants Authority agreed that the arbitrator, lawyer Gao Shuo, would submit the arbitration award. Now, the original manuscript has been found as follows: 1. Arbitration Report: The defendant, China Merchants Bureau, the law firm of arbitrator Gao Shuo, No. 316, Dufu Lane, Fuxu Road, submitted the arbitration opinion on the case of the San De Tang lawsuit against the China Merchants Bureau regarding the land disputes of Aizi No. 69 and Aizi No. 69 in the French Register. In this case, in the midst of mutual mediation, the China Merchants Bureau will not be in the slightest way restricted from its rights to proceed with reconciliation and to file for retrial in the future due to the submission of this arbitration award. This should be stated first. Second, the China Merchants Bureau has a historically specially permitted perpetual lease right to the land on the French Register No. 69 and Aizi No. 69 (see the original deed in Chinese characters for verification). Now, the San De Tang wants to sell the Aizi No. 69 part to the China Merchants Bureau and should not raise the price to as much as 390,000 taels. The French Public Works Bureau estimates that the land price is only worth 128,436 taels of silver. This should be stated second. Third, if the China Merchants Bureau follows the mediator's opinion and allows the San De Tang to take back its time problem, it should be based on the precedent of the San De Tang first signing a contract with the China Merchants Bureau in 1890 and not fully handing over the house until 1892. This time, the handover should also be extended by two years, so that the China Merchants Bureau can calmly arrange the stack room and the relocation of tenants. This should be stated third. In addition, the valuation of warehouses and civil houses at No. 69 can be done separately by inviting engineering experts to make a detailed valuation at that time. This matter is temporarily reserved. This should be stated fourth. Since the China Merchants Bureau continues to occupy the two plots of land, the rent should still be paid in full by the China Merchants Bureau in accordance with the original contract to show fairness. This arbitrator presents the above respectfully based on what he has seen. If the Jun Court has any further questions, he will be ready to obey orders at any time. This is respectfully presented to the French Concession Joint Court. December 13th, the 19th year of the Republic of China. China Merchants Bureau arbitrator Gao Shuo. ) This document was personally handed over by lawyer Gao Shuo to Du Huadong Yuesheng for forwarding and is currently under negotiation. In the future, the French Consul General and Mr. She may be able to mediate a peaceful solution.</p>
<h3 id="e152">City Public Security Bureau Strictly Forbids Pujiang Bandits from Harassing Passengers <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Requesting Assistance from the Shipping Guild</p>
<p>Forwarding to Various Shipping Companies for Suppression</p>
<p>Shanghai is a major port for commerce, with dozens of large and small ships entering the port every day. The various gangs of bandits in the Huangpu River are countless. Therefore, passengers coming to Shanghai from various places often suffer unexpected financial losses or sacrifice their time when encountering these lawless elements, and some even face the threat of death. Although the Municipal Public Security Bureau has made every effort to suppress and arrest them, the results have not been effective. Recently, the Municipal Public Security Bureau received a request from the Shanghai Travelers' Association to take strict measures to suppress them in order to ensure the safety of travelers. After considering the situation, the Public Security Bureau sent a letter to the Shanghai Shipping Guild requesting them to forward it to the various shipping companies, asking them to assist the water police in preventing this when ships arrive in Shanghai. The letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau to the Shipping Guild, greetings: The Shanghai Travelers' Association reported that the members of the association, such as Tai'an Inn, reported that bandits had accumulated along the Huangpu River port area for a long time, becoming the only way to harass traveling merchants. They often impersonate staff members of various inns, making it unpredictable. Passengers arriving at this port are inevitably subject to unexpected losses, so everyone is cautious. At noon on the 22nd of this month, the Fengyang Maru arrived at the port, and Chen Jian, a regular customer of a small inn from Guangdong, brought one family member and twelve pieces of luggage. The bandits coveted the luggage, and five or six people impersonated staff members of the small inn and forcibly took the luggage down to the rowing boat. When they arrived on the shore, they encountered Zhang Zhenmao, the real receptionist of the small inn, who exposed the bandits. The bandits immediately threatened the passenger to prevent him from making a fuss and surrounded Zhang Zhenmao, using force and beating him in the abdomen and other places, pushing him down by the side of the road. A horse-drawn cart ran over the passenger. It is well-known that Yingzhou Hotel, belonging to the passenger's uncle, extorted twelve yuan under the pretext of transporting luggage. Fortunately, the passenger gave them the money in full before they were released. In addition to the injured Zhang Zhenmao reporting to the water police, we earnestly request your association to immediately submit a report to the authorities for strict suppression in order to eliminate the harm to travelers. Furthermore, the sixteen major hotels, including Dongfang, Mengyuan, Shenzhou, Xiangbin, Yuandong, Juelu, Dachina, and Xintiandi, jointly sent a letter stating that the Pujiang bandits harass travelers, harming them day and night, and requesting the government to quickly eliminate them, etc. After reviewing the situation, it was found that the various ports along the Huangpu River have always been a gathering place for bandits. There are secret organizations such as the Thirty-Six Gang and the Twenty-Eight Gang, known as the source of evil. They either impersonate receptionists of various inns or disguise themselves as porters of various shipping companies, trying to get close to passengers and engage in deception. Passengers who unfortunately fall victim to their schemes suffer small losses of money and luggage, and large losses of people and children. Moreover, these gang rowing bandits often take advantage of the moment when the ship is about to enter the port and has not completely stopped, rushing up with hooks in groups and forcibly snatching passengers' luggage and descending. Even if passengers are skilled in traveling, it is difficult to take care of everything in the midst of such chaos and complexity. The most hateful thing is when they encounter single passengers or passengers with a lot of luggage, they will stop the boat in the middle of the river and demand exorbitant prices. If they do not get what they want, they will curse and refuse to sail. During the day, they only rock the boat and create danger deliberately. At night, they even kill people. Such situations are too numerous to mention, and newspapers have reported countless cases. There are countless more that are not reported in the newspapers. As a result, most people in society regard traveling on the waterway of the Sixteenth Pier as a dangerous road. The bandits are densely distributed on the ports, no different from a tiger's mouth. Not only do countless merchants and ordinary people complain about their travels, but I believe that officials at all levels have also unfortunately experienced it firsthand and lamented the difficulty of the road to Shu. The harm caused by the Pujiang bandits is only local, and they must impersonate legitimate porters when approaching travelers, which is not difficult to distinguish. It is not difficult to investigate and arrest them. Why is it that these petty thieves have not been eliminated to this day? If they are allowed to do evil for a long time, the harm will eventually become severe. Travelers are constantly suffering disasters. Is this the blessing of local security? Moreover, Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreign travelers pass through, and the world pays attention to it. If the guards are not sufficient, it is easy to give people an excuse. The interests of the members of the association are deeply related to the business of traveling merchants. It is inconvenient to remain silent in the face of danger. According to the reports from various hotels, we request a strict suppression of the above-mentioned situation. Therefore, we respectfully request your bureau to review and expedite the following: (1) Supervise and order the water and land police to strictly investigate and arrest the gang rowing bandits at the ports, punish them according to the law, parade them in the streets to deter their source.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>(2) Instruct the various shipping companies to strictly prohibit the hooking and rowing boats from climbing up and forcibly snatching passengers' luggage when the ships enter the port and have not stopped, in order to prevent incidents and avoid danger. Otherwise, the shipping company should be responsible, or follow the example of Japanese ships and issue permits for boarding the ships, cutting off their way. (3) Allow the association and various hotels to request voluntary police protection for business travelers at their own expense to improve the situation. If these three points can be achieved, the harm of the port bandits can be cleared, the local security can be relied on for a long time, the traveling merchants can enjoy the benefits, and the traffic will be in order. We earnestly request your approval for implementation. Countless travelers will be grateful, etc. Based on this, it was found that the rowing bandits, that is, the Thirty-Six Gang, had previously been ordered to be suppressed by the water patrol team within a limited time due to the investigation of the harassment of travelers. Now, the report shows that the rowing bandits are still rampant, which is really reckless. In addition to ordering the water patrol team to investigate and strictly deal with the matter and issue instructions, we should also send a letter to your association to inform the various shipping companies to strictly prohibit the hooking of ships by rowing boats in the Huangpu River and the forced interception of passengers' luggage, in order to ensure the safety of travelers and maintain security. We hope to receive a reply for reference, etc. After receiving the letter, the Shipping Guild sent letters to the various shipping companies, saying:</p>
<p>Shipping Guild Notice to Various Shipping Companies, greetings: We have received a public letter from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau regarding the investigation and prohibition of bandits in the Huangpu River from harassing passengers. We are instructed to immediately inform the various shipping companies to strictly prohibit the hooking of ships by rowing boats in the Huangpu River and the forced interception of passengers' luggage, in order to ensure the safety of travelers and maintain security, etc. Therefore, we have urgently recorded and printed the original letter and sent it to you. Please review it and inform the various shipping companies to comply with it. Sincerely, Shanghai Shipping Guild. Attached is a copy of the original letter from the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Garrison Headquarters Yesterday Issued a Notice <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Revoking the Previous Notice of the Dock Cargo Storage Company The Songhu Garrison Headquarters issued a notice yesterday, saying: Regarding the matter of issuing a notice, the Shanghai Municipal Government has consulted, stating that the Finance Bureau, Social Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Public Works Bureau, and Port Affairs Bureau have jointly submitted a request. The request stated that the Shanghai Dock Cargo Storage Company was found to have extorted money from sick merchants and had been jointly submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to revoke the company's license and order it to cease operations. The Municipal Government issued Directive No. 7715, approving the transfer of the consultation, etc. The Municipal Public Security Bureau complied with the order and informed the various districts and ordered strict suppression and maintenance. The Finance Bureau also reported that the personnel of the Pu Zhao River Ship Donation Inspection Office were still forcibly demanding insurance donations from boat owners. The Finance Bureau convened a meeting on the 8th of this month to discuss the matter again and decided that, in addition to complying with the directive and ordering the various districts and offices of the Public Security Bureau to strictly suppress the matter, the Finance Bureau may at any time send the company's personnel to the competent district office of the Public Security Bureau for handling if the above-mentioned situation is found again. At the same time, the Finance Bureau will first submit a joint request to the Municipal Government to forward it to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to revoke the previous notice issued to the company. The Public Security Bureau and the Social Bureau jointly received Directive No. 6411 from the Municipal Government, which was forwarded to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which replied that the company had been ordered to dissolve and ordered to surrender its license. In addition to ordering the various district offices and the Water Patrol Team of the Public Security Bureau to order the dissolution of all the offices established by the company and report the matter, and ordering the Social Bureau to limit the company to surrender the original registration license by a certain date, and then submitting another document for forwarding to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, all the original requests of the bureaus, such as the request to forward the consultation to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to revoke the notice, were jointly submitted for review and forwarding. According to this investigation, the Shanghai Dock Cargo Storage Company has been extorting money from sick businesses, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has approved the order to dissolve the company and ordered the company to submit the original registration certificate. In addition to the order to forward the consultation, we hereby inform you that we will promptly revoke the previously issued notice and request a reply.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Hope for Resolution of Liquor Trade Strike <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Director of the First District Acts as Mediator</p>
<p>The Labor's Demands Are Accepted by the Management</p>
<p>The strike in the liquor trade in this city has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Huang Zhenbo, Director of the Tobacco and Liquor Affairs Bureau of the Second District, felt that it would not be good if the strike could not be resolved, so he took the initiative to mediate. The situation yesterday is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Labor Congress Yesterday at 2:00 p.m., the labor union held its sixth member congress. Gu Jiren was elected as chairman and the meeting began with the usual formalities. The agenda was discussed as follows: (1) The management has telegraphed the provincial bureau to accuse the union of this strike. What attitude should the union take? It was decided that (A) the union should support the management in collecting evidence of the fine to plan for action; (B) the union should also negotiate with the office separately. (2) A letter should be sent to the sauce and liquor trade association to temporarily suspend the delivery of white liquor during the strike. The resolution was passed.</p>
<p>Trade Association Meeting The trade association held a member congress at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. Chairman Huang Yuming began the meeting with the usual formalities. The chairman first reported that the strike negotiation had been convened by Huang Zhenbo, Director of the Tobacco and Liquor Affairs Bureau of the Second District, to mediate between the two sides, but no agreement had yet been reached. The agenda was then discussed: (1) Continue to submit a report to the provincial bureau and the Second District Branch Bureau to investigate Ben Guangzhen; (2) Send representatives to the Second District Branch Bureau to petition. If there is no result, submit a report to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance for investigation; (3) Never stop the action until the goal of canceling the time limit is achieved.</p>
<p>Labor Negotiations At 4:00 p.m. yesterday, the labor union sent representatives Hu Gujun, Xu Ziyi, and Wang Ade to the inspection office to request the conditions of the labor from Director Li Guangzhen. Director Li sincerely received and explained, saying that the stamping of the seal was a procedure to rectify tax collection, and the office would naturally sympathize with and pay attention to the convenience of the labor. The reasons for the requested conditions were sufficient and completely accepted. The time for stamping the seal would also be extended to six hours later for those who exceeded the limit. However, the office could not accept the request to limit the time for stamping the seal and the request for compensation for the loss of work. The labor representatives immediately returned to the union and agreed to formally sign a contract for further contact this afternoon. The mediation of Director Huang also yielded considerable results and may be resolved today.</p>
<p>Director Li's Talk Director Li Guangzhen of the inspection office told a reporter from the Huadong News Agency yesterday that the office has accepted several conditions proposed by the labor for the sake of the labor. However, it is difficult to cancel the time stamp on the seal, because the office has seen that merchants intentionally take advantage of loopholes and affix seals that are not in use. In order to rectify the state tax revenue, the office has affixed the date stamp on the original seal and ordered merchants to affix it themselves when the liquor leaves the door to prevent tax evasion. All the detailed measures have been reported to the district branch bureau, the municipal social bureau, and the municipal public security bureau for the record, etc.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Director Guan of the Jiangsu Provincial Tobacco and Liquor Affairs Bureau has sent Section Chief Xue to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the strike.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Commander Xiong's Condition Gradually Improves <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>He Yingqin Visited Him Yesterday</p>
<p>Yang Yongtai Sent a Letter of Condolence</p>
<p>Commander Xiong's condition has been good since he was admitted to the orthopaedic hospital, but he has a slight cough and his body temperature is often around 38 degrees Celsius. It is reported that Dr. Niu Huisheng and the president of Baolong Hospital consulted the night before and used a certain drug injection, which was very effective. Yesterday, his body temperature dropped to around 36 degrees Celsius, which was no different from a normal person. His spirit was better and his appetite gradually increased. Since being admitted to the hospital, Commander Xiong's left hand and right foot have been clamped with boards, and he has not been able to turn over for half a month. His pain can be imagined. The doctor was afraid that his conversation would hurt his spirit, so he did not allow even close relatives to talk to him. It is reported that Xiong said to a certain officer under his command that he would listen to the doctor's words and strictly abide by the rules. Although his illness was painful, his heart was strong. However, lying flat for half a month and not being able to move sometimes felt like being dead. The pain was only bearable to him. He was injured while suppressing bandits, and now the bandits are still rampant and the suffering of the people has not been eliminated. His own pain is so unbearable that he did not expect it, etc. Those who heard his words should all sympathize with him. His injury is not only a misfortune for Xiong himself. Those who visited him yesterday included He Yingqin, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, and Liu Jiwen, Superintendent of Jianghai Customs. Yang Yongtai's condition has also gradually improved. Yesterday, he sent a special letter to express his condolences to Xiong. The letter from him to Xiong is as follows (Tianyi, my brother, is now able to get up and write with effort. Before writing to my brother, I would like to silently mourn for one minute for the colleagues who died in the plane crash. There were seven people on board that day, and only you and I are left. I heard that your injuries are in your left hand and right foot, which is more serious than mine. I am very concerned. I only injured two ribs on my left side, and the blood on my left side has not completely dissipated. I think Drs. Gu and Ding have already told you in detail. The doctor said that after half a month of rest, everything will definitely recover. The past few days have been good, and I have been sleeping and eating well. I am writing to comfort you. If the situation permits this year, and I recover my walking first, I will definitely visit your residence to see your injuries. This is the second time that my brother and I have faced danger together. During the May 3rd Massacre a few years ago, we were trapped in the Jinan Governor's Office and suddenly encountered enemy planes dropping bombs within ten steps. Eight people were killed, but you and I were sitting at a table, eating and talking, and we were safe. In this battle, five of the seven people on board died, and you and I are still the only two left. Twice we could have died together, but we did not die. Is it because God has repeatedly favored us, or is it because we still have a small responsibility to the party and the country to the society that has not been completed, and we still need to work together with the spirit of dying together to make greater concerted efforts? The coincidence of the opportunity is deeply impressed, and the friendship will never be forgotten. I deeply hope that we will build on the previous cause and seek good results, and open up the future life. I only hope that we can help each other and encourage each other. I hereby send this message and wish you a speedy recovery. Your brother, Yang Yongtai, on the sickbed of Baolong Hospital, December 22nd.</p>

<p>After taking office in the capital a few days ago, Minister of Military and Political Affairs He Yingqin came to Shanghai. It is learned that He is in urgent need of reorganizing and expanding the Shanghai Steel Plant, and the plant had already planned a reorganization during the tenure of the previous plant director, Hu Shuhua. However, due to financial constraints, it was not possible to proceed step by step. Now that the military affairs have ended, the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs has requested the Ordnance Bureau to reorganize and expand the plant. Therefore, He is taking advantage of this trip to Shanghai to visit the Gaochang Temple Shanghai Steel Plant today (24th) for inspection, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Ministry of Finance Tax Administration Admonishes Subordinates <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Should Pay Attention to Six Points</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Tax Administration issued an order to its subordinate bureaus to pay attention to the key points. The order was to comply with the matter, stating that the establishment of the unified tax system is based on the principle of increasing national income and facilitating merchants, collecting taxes once at the district where goods are produced and imported. Except for imported goods, which are still subject to customs duties, after the unified tax is paid, it can be circulated without obstruction and any tax or fee is exempt from double taxation. If there is an error in taxation, a refund will be allowed. There are regulations and laws that are very well prepared. For example, since the reform of the unified tax on cigarettes, the tax revenue has increased day by day and merchants have found it convenient. With success already achieved, the Ministry has recently issued an order to approve the abolition of Likin on January 1 next year. All cotton yarn, matches, and cement will be changed to the unified tax and will be managed by the Ministry along with cigarettes and wheat flour. The Minister has been in business for a long time and knows deeply that merchants are suffering from heavy taxes and the difficulties of bureaus. This time, the Minister has been ordered to preside over the matter. First, the provincial bureaus will be divided into district bureaus and management offices will be set up in the factory areas. The original inspection offices will be retained or abolished separately. As the reorganization is just beginning, the key points that should be paid attention to are listed below: (1) The staff will be transferred by the Ministry from time to time, and every effort should be made to ensure that they are capable and make the most of their strengths, using one person to achieve the effect of one person. (2) This reorganization of the Ministry only seeks old staff. It will never be changed easily unless it is absolutely necessary, but it must be competent, make the best use of its talents, and allocate work at any time to apply it. In the future, there will be separate reward and punishment methods to protect the employment of staff. (3) The Ministry will assess the merits and demerits. If the performance is excellent, promotion will be allowed. (4) Private gain and fraud must be punished. Merchants should be allowed to report confidentially at any time. If there is any solicitation of bribes or obstruction, once the facts are verified, there will be no leniency. (5) If it is not necessary to establish an inspection office, the office should consider the situation and abolish it to avoid the problem of obstruction at every level. (6) The director and deputy director of the bureau should be jointly responsible for the performance of their duties and should not follow the previous practice of having a nominal director. The level of work in each district bureau and the diligence, competence, and incompetence of the staff will still be assessed by the Ministry's inspectors, who will go to each district at any time to conduct inspections and personally inspect them to see the results and emphasize the tax policy. All these points should be encouraged together. We must know that to promote benefits, we must first eliminate abuses, and to cultivate ourselves, we must lead our subordinates. We must clear up all the old tax malpractices from the past so that business can develop and tax revenue can increase. We must save on expenses so that we can reduce costs and compete with the achievements of customs and salt affairs. The Minister's responsibility is to lead by example, and the directors of each bureau and the principal staff should be willing to work together to encourage each other so that the policy of benefiting the country and the people will not be in vain. In addition to issuing an order, the directors (director and deputy director of the bureau) (director and deputy director of the office) should all comply with it and report the date of receipt of the document for investigation. This order.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, saying: Minister of Finance, Your Excellency: The Shanghai Coal Industry Association requested the abolition of the coal tax. Your department has already given a ruling on the matter. Now, the association has recorded and attached a telegram requesting assistance. The number of domestic coal production is limited, and with the influx of imported coal, the business is already sluggish. The heavy tax will further promote the lifeline. At this time, the political reforms are being refreshed and the abolition of Likin is being realized. If it is implemented without hindering business, there may be a revival of business. If domestic coal is still subject to the coal tax, the coal industry will never have a chance to survive, which is not the intention of the state to protect industry. It is reasonable to request your department to review and approve the request of the association to abolish the coal tax to relieve the difficulties of merchants. We sincerely pray, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>Since the re-planning of the city's area, Wusong in Baoshan County, Xinzhuang in the Wu Songjiang County, and Qibao have all been included in the scope of the city's area. Since the municipal government has not yet taken over Xinzhuang and other places, the old state remains. In June of this year, the former Business Consolidation Council, at the request of the former Qibao district branch, established a branch office in Qibao. The Business Consolidation Council convened a representative assembly on June 21 and decided to prepare for the establishment in Xinzhuang. The Chamber of Commerce then sent a letter to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce to forward it to the Shanghai Business Convenience to temporarily postpone the establishment. After learning about the situation, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce ordered the business affairs department to consult with the Social Bureau. Before the municipal government takes over the relevant villages, the old state will be temporarily maintained. After the administrative area is determined, the matter will be reconsidered, etc. It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also sent a letter to the district party headquarters, stating that the Qibao party affairs organization has long been incorporated into the city and the people's organizations are under the guidance and jurisdiction of the party. The administrative area can also be followed, and there is no need to purely use the standards of the government's administrative area. The Municipal Party Headquarters Executive Committee Secretariat also wrote to the Social Bureau to handle the matter, ordering the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to prepare for the establishment. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce also received a letter from the Xinzhuang Town Chamber of Commerce requesting the forwarding of the letter to the Municipal Social Bureau to cancel the establishment of a branch office in Qibao and to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to temporarily postpone the establishment. It is also reported that the Xinzhuang Chamber of Commerce believes that the establishment of a branch office in Qibao by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has a significant impact on the Chamber's affairs. It plans to send personnel to Shanghai in the near future to request the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Chairman Lin Kanghou to mediate and assist.</p>

<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society recently received a distress letter from Taihu County, Anhui Province, regarding a bandit robbery and request for relief. The letter stated that Taihu is located in the western border of Anhui Province, neighboring Huangsuwang. Last year, it suffered from the disturbance of Yu Yanong, and the people were still in shock. This summer, it was disturbed by the remnants of Han Jie, and the entire city was looted, causing great damage to its vitality. Unexpectedly, on November 16th, a group of over two thousand communists from Huangmei, Hubei Province, suddenly attacked and captured our county town. They killed our fellow villagers and town leaders, robbed our goods, burned our tools, incited our ignorant people, kidnapped our students, arbitrarily damaged government offices and schools, and ransacked stores of all sizes, burning documents, books, and grain. They transported away clothes, bedding, and silver. The catastrophe of Changsha was played out in the small town of Taihu. Alas! The bandits have fled far away, and the people have gradually gathered, but most of the ashes are rotten. Fathers cry out for their sons, husbands grieve for their wives, there is no grain to eat, no clothes to wear, no mats to sit on, no beds to sleep on, no cooking utensils, no lamps or fire. The vitality of the hundred-mile Taihu Mountain has waned, and hunger and cold are imminent in the cold winter. There has never been a catastrophe greater than this. If the benevolent people of the world, with a broad and compassionate heart, share our pain and suffering, and offer food and clothing or distribute wealth, and pour out the water of benevolence to revive the parched lands, then…</p>

<h3 id="e169">National Goods Bank General Manager Zhu Chengzhang Kidnapped Yesterday Morning, Escaped Late at Night <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Automobile Driver Wang Amao Died Tragically</p>
<p>Zhu's Beloved Daughter Runzhu Hit by Three Bullets</p>
<p>Female Nurse Injured in Left Hand by Stray Bullet</p>
<p>Zhu Slightly Uncomfortable, Resting Quietly in the Hospital</p>
<p>The Kidnappers' Automobile Permit Was Found to be Forged</p>
<p>Zhu Chengzhang, General Manager of the China National Goods Bank, was kidnapped by bandits near his residence on Yuyuan Road yesterday morning. The driver was shot and killed by the bandits. Zhu's daughter and a female nurse were injured by stray bullets. After the bandits kidnapped Zhu, they immediately bundled him into a car parked by the roadside and sped away. After neighbors reported the incident to the police station by telephone, the bandits had already gone far away without a trace. There were six people in Zhu's car, one was kidnapped, one was killed, and two were injured. This is truly a tragic incident among the recent kidnapping cases.</p>
<p>Bandits Open Fire on Zhu Chengzhang Zhu Chengzhang lives in a Western-style house at No. 189, opposite Yuyuan New Village on Yuyuan Road. At around 9:40 yesterday morning, Zhu was traveling in his own car, No. 10340, driven by the driver Tu Amao. In addition to the master and servant, Zhu's daughter Runzhu, Zhu's wife's nurse Ms. Deng, and the driver's assistant Wu Linsheng and tea servant Jiang Laitao were also in the car, a total of six people. Zhu got into the car and ordered Amao to drive. Who knew that before they had gone far, a car suddenly blocked the road ahead, making it difficult for the driver Wang Amao to advance or retreat. As he did not know how to offend the other party, bullets flew towards him, striking him incessantly. Amao was shot and fell in the driver's seat.</p>
<p>Zhu Was Kidnapped, Daughter Injured, Why the Bullets?</p>
<p>It turned out that they were fired by the kidnappers as a prelude to kidnapping Zhu Chengzhang. As the gunpowder smoke cleared, the car door suddenly opened, and two bandits jumped into the car, dragged Zhu out of the car, and sped away in the bandits' car in a flash. Zhu's daughter, Ms. Runzhu, was sitting next to her father and was hit by a stray bullet. Her companion, Ms. Deng, was also injured by gunfire. Thus, four of the six people in the car suffered, and only Wu and Jiang, who were sitting with the driver, were unscathed. However, they were so terrified that they were like wooden chickens.</p>
<p>Neighbors Report to the Police Station Zhu's residence is in a very secluded area near Yuyuan Road. At the sound of gunfire, the neighbors were shocked and immediately reported to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station. The Chinese and Western detectives drove to the scene, but the bandits' car had long disappeared. The driver Wang Amao, who was shot, died from his injuries. Zhu's daughter Runzhu and the female nurse were sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. Ms. Zhu was hit by three bullets, one of which pierced her abdomen and grazed her liver, and the other two were in her left and right arms, which were not seriously injured. The nurse Deng was injured in her left hand, which was less serious.</p>
<p>Purchasing Christmas Gifts Zhu is a 47-year-old Anhui native and a Christian. He has been working in the banking industry for many years and has a wide circle of friends in Shanghai. His daughter Runzhu is 17 years old and is studying at the McTyeire School. Zhu's wife, Ms. Huang, has been ill for a long time and has been bedridden for several months. Ms. Deng is her nurse. Recently, Ms. Huang's illness has slightly improved, so she instructed her beloved daughter Runzhu to accompany her father in the car to purchase winter solstice gifts and planned to set up a Christmas tree at home tonight to celebrate. Therefore, the father and daughter were very happy when they went out, not expecting that disaster was imminent and that such a huge misfortune would occur only a few steps away from their home.</p>
<p>Blood Stains on the Cushion Zhu's residence is on Yuyuan Road, not far from HOTELTINY. To enter from Yuyuan Road, one must pass through a private road, in the center of which is a circular flowerbed. Cars going east and west circle around the garden. Therefore, when Zhu's car was going out, it was heading west and north. The bandits' car was parked between the flowerbed and the wall, blocking Zhu's car's progress. Two bandits were also left to the east of the flowerbed. When Zhu's car approached, it was difficult to advance or retreat. When Zhu was dragged out of the car, there were many blood stains left on the seat cushion. It is also a question whether Zhu was shot. The number of bandits was about five or six, half of whom were armed with guns.</p>
<p>The Bandits' Car Had a Fake Permit The license plate number of the bandits' car was 7732, which was also seen by a neighbor and reported to the police station. However, according to a later investigation, the car permit was forged. Zhu's car is a sedan-style foreign blue car. Several pieces of the window glass were broken by bullets. There were blood stains on the driver's seat cushion and the car seat cushion.</p>
<p>The Court Inspects the Corpse The scene of the incident was originally in the Chinese Concession, but because Yuyuan Road was built beyond the boundary, the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives in police cars to search in all directions after the incident. However, after Ren, the district chief of the Caoxi Road Sixth District Public Security Bureau, heard the news, he immediately led Inspector Xu and others to investigate. The Public Security Bureau's Third Section reported the corpse of the driver Wang Amao to the local court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Wu Shixin and Detective Xuan Zhiming were appointed to conduct the autopsy.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Escaped Last Night This newspaper received further news at 2:00 AM this morning that Mr. Zhu escaped from the bandits' den at around 11:00 PM last night. He suffered minor injuries and was accompanied to Baolong Hospital for treatment, then transferred to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road. Mr. Zhu is in good spirits, and his relatives and friends must be pleasantly surprised to hear the news.</p>

<p>Lu Shaotang, a native of Suzhou, lives at No. 235, Daqing Lane, Jiujiang Road. He is a real estate businessman with a good reputation in Shanghai, which made him coveted by kidnapping bandits.

After Chinese Detective Lu Liankui purchased information and investigated in many ways, he arrested several criminals related to the case in the French Concession on Lafayette Road yesterday. They confessed that the ticket was hidden at No. 374 Hart Road in the Public Concession. The Chinese and Western detectives of the Old Gate Police Station went to the address fully armed and rescued Lu. At that time, there were two people guarding the ticket. Because they were outnumbered, Lu escaped safely. However, he had been in the bandits' den for four days and suffered a great deal of mental stimulation.</p>

<p>Caused by Tidal Surge</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post reported that at around 11:00 this morning (the 23rd), two ships in the Huangpu River were suddenly agitated by the tide and brushed past the Libang ship, which was moored between the sixth and seventh pontoons, breaking the mooring line. The Libang ship then drifted with the tide, causing its stern to graze the Pacific Ocean telecommunications cable ship of the Great Northern Telegraph Company, breaking its pontoon mooring line. The Pacific Ocean ship also drifted to the Datong Wharf in Pudong and struck the Japanese freighter Takayama Maru (transliteration), destroying its right railing and steel plate. Fortunately, the Libang ship had managed to drop both left and right anchors by this time, but when it dropped anchor, it collided with the seventh pontoon. The Pacific Ocean ship also dropped anchor and was able to stop drifting. However, the names of the two ships that caused the initial disaster had not been determined by the afternoon. It is said that one ship was the Swedish ship Niagara, but this has not been confirmed. The total amount of losses will be estimated by experts.</p>

<p>Widow and Orphans' Voices Full of Tears</p>
<p>The case of the tragic death of Li Hailin, a school servant at Tongwen College, has been seen in various newspapers in recent days. The family members of the deceased are young, and only Li's wife is supporting herself after childbirth. Therefore, the Japanese have repeatedly intimidated her after Li's death, and forced Li's wife to cry and move the body out of the school on the afternoon of the previous day (the 21st), without mentioning any follow-up measures, with the intention of eliminating the problem. Although Li's wife led a group of orphans and pleaded for compensation with tears, the Japanese unilaterally verbally agreed to give 800 yuan, without mentioning the cost of Li's wife's old age and the living expenses and education of the children. However, Li still has brothers in his ancestral home in Hubei. When he heard the news of Li's death, he was extremely angry and has recently set out to Shanghai to negotiate. More than 60 Chinese servants in the school also believe that Li's case is unjustified and that the Japanese usually treat Chinese servants harshly. In order to help Li's case and demand improved treatment, they have initiated the organization of a school workers' union. In addition, the Li case support association organized by Chinese in the school has decided to do everything in its power to help Li's family to achieve the conditions of dismissing and punishing the perpetrators of the tragic case and providing compensation and follow-up measures.</p>

When it sailed to the Qingkou Sea, it suddenly encountered a large gang of bandits sailing towards them in four or five pirate ships. They opened fire and ordered the ship to stop. When the crew saw this, they turned the rudder and retreated to avoid danger, but the pirate ships chased after them and continued to open fire. Four or five members of the Hong ship's crew were injured by bullets. At this point, the crew members were frightened, but the pirates continued to chase and eventually caught up with them. The pirates swarmed onto the ship, armed with guns or great force, and struck people indiscriminately, injuring another six or seven people. The pirates searched everywhere, broke open a leather suitcase in the ship owner Luo's room, took out more than 600 yuan in small silver coins and more than 400 yuan in copper coins, more than ten account books from the sand ship, and freight invoices, threw all the account books into the sea, and were still not satisfied. They searched all the crew members and robbed all the silver coins on their bodies, without exception. Before leaving, they kidnapped the ship owner Luo and two crew members and said that they would prepare ransom money and redeem them within ten days. The pirates drove the ship and fled to the East China Sea. The Hong ship is now sailing to Fushan and has docked. The injured crew members have been sent to the hospital for treatment. Two crew members died due to their injuries. The ship immediately purchased coffins and collected the bodies, and sent crew members to Shanghai to report to the cargo numbers and ask them to find a way to rescue the kidnapped ship owner and the other two men. The cargo numbers have telegraphed the local authorities to strictly suppress the bandits and ensure the safety of shipping.</p>
<h3 id="e178">False Alarm, Armed Police Arrived <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>An Incident at Longmao Money Shop</p>
<p>The Wusong Public Security Seventh District Office received an emergency report at around 7:00 last night from the No. 2 alarm bell of the Longmao Money Shop on Songxing Road. District Chief Yang Maorong immediately dispatched Patrol Officer Dai Guosheng and Li Nong, along with more than 20 detectives and armed police officers, to the scene to surround the area. The traffic at the nearby Nanchang Road, Zhongxin Road, and Wenchang Road was temporarily cut off. Then the patrol officers and police officers entered the building to search, but the employees of the shop were calm and nothing was happening. They were suddenly frightened by the sudden arrival of the armed police officers and wondered what had happened. After Patrol Officer Dai and others explained their purpose, they realized that there had been a misunderstanding. No one knew who had pressed the alarm bell, and no one admitted to it. At that time, nearby shops closed their doors one after another and suffered a great shock. The alarm was not lifted until the police officers withdrew. District Chief Yang believes that the alarm bell is important and should not be pressed randomly, so he notified the shop that they should be extra careful in the future to avoid misunderstandings and hindering public order.</p>

<h3 id="e180">British Consulate Staff Embezzled <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Sold a Large Number of Stamps</p>
<p>Sentenced to 30 Days Imprisonment</p>
<p>The British Consulate is busy with affairs and diligent in reporting news. Every day, dozens of letters are mailed to domestic and foreign locations, and a Ningbo native, Le Cangbai, is hired to handle the affairs. The monthly postal expenses are more than 100 yuan. However, since June, the expenses have increased significantly. In the past, the monthly cost was about 110 to 120 yuan, but in July it increased to 150 yuan, and in August it increased to 153 yuan. The Consul, Mr. Packer, who also concurrently serves as a juror at the Mixed Court, is very honest. He saw that the postal expenses increased monthly, but the number of letters sent did not increase. Although the post office increased the postage for letters sent overseas from July, it should not have been such a large increase. Therefore, from September 1st, he began to handle the mailing duties himself. The expenses for that month were only 115 yuan, and the expenses for October and November were only 110 to 120 yuan. However, Mr. Bao was busy with affairs and could not always take care of the mailing duties, so he recently ordered Le to paste the stamps. To prevent him from embezzling, he was instructed to paste the stamps in the same room under supervision. However, Le's deceptive mind was very clever. He first fabricated several envelopes, mixed them into the letters to be sent, and asked Bao for stamps to paste them one by one. Taking advantage of the opportunity to send them to the post office, he removed the stamps pasted on the fake letters and sold them to others. This kind of trick was not easy to detect. Therefore, the postal expenses required this month increased again, averaging one yuan more per day than the previous month. Bao suspected it and paid special attention to it. The day before yesterday afternoon, Le brought four letters to Bao's office and asked for stamps. After Bao examined them, he inquired about the dispatching officer who wrote on the envelope. The truth was revealed, and he immediately telegraphed the Chief Patrol Station to send Western detective Mei Sheng to arrest Le. Together with the four fabricated letters, Le was escorted to the local court of the Special District yesterday. Consul Bao also appeared in court to testify. According to the trial by Judge Xu, Le confessed that he was afraid that Consul Bao would blame him for the inappropriate postal expenses in the past and would be suspended from his position. Therefore, he started to cheat yesterday, hoping to get more money and begged for leniency. Judge Xu sentenced him to 30 days imprisonment and confiscated the fabricated envelopes.</p>

Later, the detective learned that the corpse was a maid in the family of Weng Zhiguang, a Chaozhou native in Tianhui Lane, Bushi Road, French Concession. He immediately notified the deceased's employer, who purchased a coffin yesterday for burial and placed it in a cemetery. According to the employer, the woman's surname was Huang, her name was Yizhen, and she was 40 years old. She was hired in Chaozhou and brought to Shanghai for only a month. Because she suffered from a mental illness, he originally intended to send her back to her hometown on the Taigu Shandong steamer on the evening of the 15th.

<p>Consignor Passes Blame to Receiving Agent</p>

As usual, the freight agent filled out a receipt for the consignor. As soon as the consignor left, the water patrol arrived for inspection and found the vegetable basket suspicious. The water police opened it and discovered a large quantity of opium. The water police deemed it contraband and questioned the crew about consigning it. The crew replied that they were unaware that it was opium when they accepted it. The water police immediately took away the opium. As the original consignor could not be found, they took the freight agent, Mr. Jiang, into custody for questioning.</p>

(4) Since the association was reorganized into a trade association, old members have the certificates of the former Businessmen's Association. However, new members do not have certificates. Should all new members be issued new certificates to unify the management? It was resolved to hand it over to the General Affairs Section for handling. (5) According to the Social Affairs Bureau's document No. 4226, the association's application for registration stated that companies that have not been legally registered must not use the company name. The association does not know whether members Binrenji Company and Zhonghua Company have been registered. Should they be inquired by letter? It was resolved to inquire by letter. (6) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter requesting that the association pay the 65 yuan in membership fees within ten days. How should this be raised? It was resolved to hand it over to the Finance Section for handling. The rest is omitted.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editor: After reading yesterday's (December 22nd) report on the establishment of a labor-capital agreement in the pawnshop industry in your "Local News" section, there was a statement that the capital representative Yu Langxi was an outsider and could not attend, and the chairman prevented him from speaking. This is inconsistent with the facts and is based on hearsay, which has caused confusion among my colleagues on the capital side who have been inquiring about it. I am afraid that this will cause misunderstandings and affect the implementation of the agreement. I am writing to request that you correct this information to maintain public friendship. Sincerely, Yu Langxi. December 23rd</p>
<p>To the Editor: I have just read your newspaper's "Local News" section, which reported that the workers of the Zhabei Huashang Public Bus Company were on strike yesterday and mentioned that at 7 a.m., the ticket sellers at the Shishan Road intersection suddenly stopped issuing tickets and put the tickets into the box. The above information is not true and may be a mishearing. After checking, when each car left the factory at 6 a.m. yesterday, all the workers went on strike uniformly. The ticket boxes of the ticket sellers were all automatically placed at the Shishan Road intersection with their money bags and parts. I am only responsible for protection. Also, the name of my position is "schedule worker" and not "ticket seller." Yesterday, in addition to following the union's orders to go on strike, I did not collect or stop issuing any ticket seller's ticket boxes. This matter concerns my credibility, and I am writing to your newspaper to request a correction. Sincerely, Quan Zhongqi.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Aspirations for the Year 1931 <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>New Chevrolet</p>
<p>Price Reduction Attracts Attention from All Sectors</p>
<p>Various Improvements Comparable to Higher-Priced Automobiles</p>
<p>In this year of 1931, with a flood of new car models, a piece of news that might astonish everyone is the actual price drop of the new Chevrolet car. New car releases are an annual event, but Chevrolet's price reduction is bound to pique significant interest in the automotive industry.</p>
<p>The facts are as follows: the Roadster, originally priced at $495, is now only $475; the Sport Roadster has been reduced from $515 to $495; and the Standard Coach has also dropped from $565 to $535. There are three other models with price reductions, which I will not elaborate on one by one. However, the Chevrolet Motor Company was founded in 1911, and the production of roadsters began in 1915. In these fifteen years, its price has never been below $490. This year's new car actually breaks the previous record, which is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>Why did Chevrolet lower its prices? Some people think it must be to cope with competition. However, the truth is far from it. Chevrolet already has a deeply entrenched position in the market. A reduction of twenty or thirty dollars per car will not have as significant an impact as one might imagine. Reliable sources within the company indicate that this price reduction is due to continuous improvements in manufacturing, which have gradually reduced expenses. As costs decrease, the car price naturally follows suit. Chevrolet cars have always aimed to serve the people, and if they can reduce the financial burden on customers even by a small amount, they will strive to achieve it.</p>
<p>On November 8th, Chevrolet held a special public exhibition to showcase the new car. Many new cars have already been produced to meet customer preferences, and they can be purchased immediately. All nineteen branch factories have started production to keep up with demand, as the announcement of the new car will immediately result in a surge of orders, which may be difficult to fulfill in time. Therefore, it is better to start production earlier to be more prepared. The design of the new car is extremely beautiful and has been greatly improved compared to last year. The ride is smoother than before, and the lifespan has also been increased considerably.</p>
<p>One noteworthy improvement is the solution to the excessive heat generated by the engine. In summer, the weather is already hot, and drivers feel even hotter because their bodies are close to the engine. Now, with this new arrangement, it will naturally be much cooler in summer. However, when this heat is needed in winter, it can still be obtained because the heat shield can be installed or removed at any time. The driving mechanism has also been improved, and the brakes are not affected by the weather, so they can be used safely regardless of cold or heat.</p>
<p>The steel wire wheels are beautiful and durable, and the tire size is perfectly matched to the car body. Headlights and taillights are often overlooked, but the new Chevrolet is entirely chrome-plated to prevent rust. Chrome is a recently discovered non-rusting metal, and its value is quite high. The new Chevrolet has reduced its price, but its equipment is comparable to that of high-priced cars, demonstrating a degree of sacrifice. The wheelbase has been widened by two inches, making the interior more comfortable than before, and the seats have also been enlarged. This perfect equipment is naturally welcomed by most customers. Special attention has been paid to safety equipment because the International Road Association's conference resolution on car accidents has notified car manufacturers in various countries to improve their mechanisms, and Chevrolet has paid even more attention to this matter.</p>

<h3 id="e204">New York Auto Show by Ping Baoshan <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Opening on January 3rd</p>
<p>Monday, January 5th, is designated as International Day. The 31st annual auto show, held at the Grand Central Palace in New York from January 3rd to 10th, 1931, will extend hospitality to overseas guests. The planned program is highly valuable and will ensure that attendees' visit is worthwhile.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 5th, a special conference will be held for International Day, providing guests with an opportunity to meet with prominent figures from various automobile factories. Issues such as the global distribution and operation of automobile manufacturing, as well as recent developments in the automobile industry and transportation, will be discussed one by one. In the afternoon, overseas guests can visit the auto show at the Grand Central Palace, where samples of automobiles and related products from 360 manufacturers will be displayed and distributed. Detailed answers will be provided to any questions.</p>
<p>On the evening of Tuesday, January 6th, all guests are invited to the annual banquet at the Commodore Hotel, where leaders in the domestic automobile industry will gather.</p>
<p>During the following week, anyone interested can form groups to visit and inspect automobile factories in Detroit and neighboring areas.</p>
<p>The New York headquarters, located at 366 Madison Avenue, welcomes guests to register and collect exhibition badges on the opening day of the exhibition (Saturday, January 3rd).</p>
<p>The paint color of the car body uses the Tucker blending method, making it bright and radiant, and even more magnificent and luxurious than the 1930 model.</p>
<p>The radiator is one of the most important components of a car, as the engine can overheat after prolonged driving. This is entirely reliant on the radiator to dissipate the heat. The new 1931 car has paid special attention to this, increasing the size of the radiator's cold water pipe to prevent damage to the cylinders. The placement of the horn is even more unique, being installed directly below the left headlight, making it beautiful and unconventional in appearance and extremely convenient to use without taking up space. In addition to these, a mudguard has been newly invented. Cars driving on muddy or rainy streets often become covered in mud and unsightly stains. Now, with the installation of this device, cars can avoid this problem and remain clean all year round. This is another unique feature of the car.</p>
<p>The car body is manufactured by the famous Fisher Body Company. The current trend in the automotive industry is towards low-profile car bodies, and the new car meets this requirement. Therefore, it looks refined and lovely, indistinguishable from high-priced cars. The car body painting is extremely practical and provides unlimited convenience for drivers.</p>
<p>Speaking of the car's interior, because the wheelbase has been increased by two inches, the space is exceptionally spacious. The layout includes ash receptacles, armrests, silk woven cushions, and shatterproof glass to prevent danger. Although these features have existed in the past, their application to cars priced below $490 is a first. All metal parts inside the car are chrome-plated, and doors can be opened with a light touch, without requiring much effort. The driver's seat has also been greatly improved, and all tools are systematically arranged, making them easy to use at a glance. Other components also contribute significantly.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Development of British-Made Motorcycles <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Possessing the Advantages of Small Cars</p>
<p>In recent years, the British automobile manufacturing industry has seen the emergence of so-called "baby" cars, which have become quite popular. Initially, only one or two manufacturers created these extremely small cars, but now even famous automobile factories are producing this style of car, and their designs are extremely exquisite. These so-called small cars are highly efficient, low in price, and very economical to operate. In short, the success of these small cars has led many to speculate that they would completely eliminate motorcycles.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this fear has not materialized. The number of motorcycle buyers remains very large, and British manufacturers are making every effort to improve motorcycle manufacturing. As a result, not only are their products the best in the world, but they also enjoy a significant advantage in sales. This situation also applies to the bicycle manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>The year 1929 was a record year for British bicycles and motorcycles. In terms of motorcycles alone, British-made motorcycles accounted for 60% of the global output. This year, however, British motorcycle production is likely to decrease. In the first six months, exports fell from 42,798 units last year to 30,921 units this year. However, overall, the percentage of British exports is likely to remain close to that of 1929, as the decline in production is common to other countries as well. For example, the United States' production in the first six months of this year compared to the same period last year has fallen by the same amount as Britain, accounting for 28%. The reason for the decline in production is probably due to the decline of various industries, but the situation varies from country to country. The economic crisis in Australia has affected British motorcycle exports, accounting for 25% in the first six months of this year.</p>
<p>In the first six months of 1929, bicycle exports amounted to 190,523 units, while the number for the same period this year was 152,216 units, a decrease of about 20%. Of this decline, 75% is due to the unrest in India, which purchased 27,000 fewer British bicycles than last year. The Chinese market has also been severely affected by the political situation, resulting in sluggish sales of British bicycles, which has nothing to do with the quality of the products.</p>
<p>The annual motorcycle and bicycle exhibition in Olympia fully demonstrates the level of British-made products. This year's products are indeed superior to those of previous years. A total of 46 motorcycle manufacturers participated in the exhibition, displaying 160 models, of which only five were foreign products. The improvements in style and construction are noteworthy. Five years ago, the average motorcycle cost about 120 pounds, but now a motorcycle with the speed and comfort of a small car costs only three-quarters of that.</p>
<p>The motorcycles on display at this year's exhibition range from those priced at 20 pounds to more luxurious models. The cars feature various speed mechanisms, three-wheeled configurations, and comfortable weather adjustments, while remaining extremely economical to operate. Although there are no shocking innovations, the overall progress is evident. British manufacturers have also made excellent progress in eliminating obnoxious noises. There have been many improvements in the engine, making it cleaner and lighter, with balanced power, easy starting, and improved gear shifting. The automatic oiling system is also very effective.</p>
<p>The historical motorcycles displayed by the Royal Automobile Club are most likely to attract the attention of visitors. These groundbreaking motorcycles not only illustrate various advances in style but also have other fascinating origins. For example, one car has a frame made entirely of wood, another is propelled by steam, and yet another has its components completely installed in the rear wheel. There are also two sidecars that have carried their owners around the world. Overall, the exhibition was a success, and even foreign visitors highly praised the British-made motorcycles.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Sister's Remains by Wu Xiaotian <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Published by Caoye Society</p>
<p>This is a recently published collection of essays. The author, Tang Zengyang, is known for his poetry. I remember reading his poetry collection, "A Solitary Song," a year ago. In each of his lyrical poems, he could stir my inner emotions because the true emotions expressed in poetry are the most genuine aspect of life, especially since poets possess extremely keen senses. Therefore, people in the literary world often say that writing essays with a poet's pen is the most beautiful and interesting. However, the "Sister's Remains" collection contains even more of these beautiful elements, making it easier for us to be moved. It is truly like singing a beautiful lyrical poem.</p>
<p>New literature in China seems to be showing signs of decline, especially in the nineteenth year of the Republic. We only need to look at the literary books presented to the reading public by the domestic publishing industry, which are as rare as morning stars. The categories of poetry and prose have almost fallen into silence, even though some such works are occasionally published in various publications. However, their power is very small and cannot attract special attention from readers. This is a very obvious fact. Since the publication of Tang's "Sister's Remains," it has broken the silence in the literary world. It seems to have considerable power, as this collection of essays suddenly appears before the reader's eyes, which is truly unexpected. However, the essence of the content in this collection certainly has the value of being published. This crystallization of blood and tears expresses the author's unique greatness everywhere. Regarding this point, Mr. Sun Dayong's preface analyzes it in great detail. The preface begins like this:</p>
<p>In modern China, filled with terrifying murderous intent and with the river of love dried up, how delighted I am to read this collection by Tang Zengyang, "Sister's Remains."</p>
<p>The world is too big, and human reason is so complex and contradictory that the meaning of life disappears invisibly in this phenomenon, which is truly not worthwhile.</p>
<p>Love is the net that connects the complexity and contradictions of human reason. Poets are the ones who hold tightly to the total network, the top of the net, and spread the meshes of the net so that the earth and humanity are enveloped beneath it. Everything on earth, everything human, whether tangible or intangible, is purified, harmonized, beautified, and reaches the realm of the greatness of life. This is the poet's skill.</p>
<p>What Zengyang expresses in this collection is filled with that thing called love. His "sister" is nothing more than a symbol of love, and her "remains" are precisely the image of love's being ravaged, trampled, and being the expression of love's river dried up after experiencing terrifying murderous intent.</p>
<p>This is truly the poet's painstaking effort.</p>
<p>Here, Mr. Sun has already explained the meaning contained in this collection of essays with exceptional detail. However, this is by no means an ordinary and unfounded explanation. Undoubtedly, it is based on the principles of poetry, paying more attention to the unique expression of love by the author in this collection of essays. Therefore, we will be deeply convinced of the phrase (the poet's emotions are especially rich) after reading this collection. At the same time, we must understand that not long ago, the Chinese literary scene was not only a scene of utter darkness but also filled with extreme terrifying murderous intent. The so-called proletarian poetry, besides barking for practical purposes, at most, was only waving flags and shouting slogans, without any meaning at all. The forms and techniques were not given any attention, making us feel that it was merely a literary work composed of slogans and banners, which simply could not be. This phenomenon was certainly the greatest crisis presented by the Chinese literary world. This (Sister's Remains) is a successful work in terms of poetic essence and has reached the highest peak of artistic defense.</p>
<p>The entire book contains eighteen essays: (1) Moonlit Night, (2) Lingering Ghost, (3) Shadow of Tears, (4) Sister's Remains, (5) Her Cry, (6) Winter's Bitter Smile, (7) Blessing, (8) Red Wine of Life, (9) Skull in the Graveyard Grass, (10) It's Late at Night, (11) Fate of Fallen Flowers, (12) Vague Destination, (13) Destruction of Love, (14) Nameless Poetic Soul, (15) New Baby, (16) Disabled Soul, (17) Fossil of the Ancient Sea, (18) Last Funeral Bell. The volume begins with a prefatory poem (the prophecy before death is especially gentle and fluent and is truly a rare poem).</p>
<p>(The poet's sadness is probably his nature. This is something everyone admits. Zengyang's collection has a heavy color of sadness, which is also natural.) This is what Mr. Sun said in the preface, but it has a full reason. For example, the author says this in the (Moonlit Night) essay:</p>
<p>(In the flower shade covered by the bright moon, I, who have fallen into the sea of suffering, once embraced a young girl and gave her the comfort of love. The soil still remains on her haggard lips, and the lipstick that is about to fade. Her tired and shrunken ears are still full of low, mournful songs, and the sound waves of delicate gasps are deeply imprinted in my lonely mind. In fact, the past illusions unfold like a silver screen. In the midst of a tragic and blurred recall, I cannot help but feel disheartened. Now, I have bid farewell to my lovely hometown and sunk into the abyss of a foreign land.</p>
<p>Gazing at the clouds and mountains, I can only shed tears.)</p>
<p>(Here, the poet has already nakedly displayed a sad heart before people.) (However, the sadness is true sadness, not a vain, moaning sadness. Therefore, Zengyang's sadness has its own characteristics. He gently stepped over his "Sister's Remains" and walked to the world of mankind. Therefore, his sadness also has such... He has already transcended the real situation of sadness and stepped into the ideal country.) This is written very clearly in his (Lingering Ghost), but his sadness contains infinite effort and hope. The author clearly writes: (Happiness requires courage to pursue, and happiness requires effort to move forward. Historical facts tell me this. I feel....) The past has become an elusive illusion, and the future may contain a ray of brilliant hope. From now on, I can only muster my inherent energy and fight forward against the darkness that hinders the free progress of mankind, and seize the glory that shines in the front of the era... (Moonlit Night) (In the hazy thoughts, I only seek a bright future.) (Winter's Bitter Smile)</p>
<p>These descriptions are all different from those of decadent poets who only focus on sadness. Truly, like what is written in (Winter's Bitter Smile), (how to work hard is even more greatness that is not easy for ordinary poets to have). This is truly the most correct and inevitable criticism. (As for the precise refinement of words, the detailed description, and the neat structure in the collection,) I also agree with what Mr. Sun said (everyone who reads it wants to feel it, so I won't describe it).</p>
<p>International Trade Herald</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau issued the International Trade Herald, the materials have been rich and sales have increased, especially among Japanese buyers. It has now been published to the ninth issue of the first volume (December issue).

<p>(Continued from the Fifth)</p>
<p>Looking at Mr. Sang Chongyi's "Chinese Twin Beauties," I cannot help but think of Mr. Zheng Mantuo, the Shanghai calendar poster artist.</p>
<p>Mr. Tanabe Itaru's "Studio" is purely a product of the official academic school, with many shortcomings. The main ones are that the sensuality of the nude is too strong, the expression of spatiality is too shallow, and it is too focused on detailed depiction.</p>
<p>Mr. Ikebe Jun's "Dance" is by an author who was originally a renowned cartoonist. Using his accustomed cartooning techniques to create this dance of figures naturally achieves considerable effect.</p>
<p>Mr. Nagahara Kotaro's "Star" is not of the twentieth century and therefore has no relation to us. The author is a surviving member of the White Horse Society.</p>
<p>Mr. Okubo Sakujiro's "Vegetable Market" is commonplace.</p>
<p>Mr. Ishikawa Toraji's "Spring in Suzhou" is dry, and Mr. Kinzan Heizo's "Spring" is delicate, with the style of Wada.</p>
<p>Mr. Takama Sochichi's "Morning at the Window" has an unbalanced composition and lacks a unified effect, but its light and bright colors are enough to redeem its lost appeal. His style has much in common with Mr. Makino's, but Mr. Makino excels in his vigorous and unrestrained spirit, while he excels in his light and elegant spirit.</p>
<p>A Chinese-style hall with an ancient and elegant atmosphere is arranged with a folding chair and a small tea table. On the table is a vase of blooming fresh flowers, and behind the flowers hangs a couplet in clerical script with seven characters each. In the right corner hangs a red gauze lantern, and under the lantern is a girl in a blue floral satin dress, extending her fair hand as if lighting the lamp. This painting is titled "China Lantern" and the author is Mr. Takamura Masao, a surviving member of the Bu-She school and a member of the current Pacific Painting Society. I really cannot understand why this painting was not hung together with Mr. Wada Eisaku's "Early Spring."</p>
<p>Mr. Mita Yasushi's "Seated Portrait" is a work with a cautious attitude, with an excellent sense of color.</p>
<p>Mr. Suzuki Chikumasa's "Nude on Grass" is a major achievement of this year's Imperial Exhibition. Its strong and dominant presence is enough to overwhelm the generally timid artists of the Imperial Exhibition. The painting is very large, at least 300 size or more. Every year's Imperial Exhibition, especially this year's, has countless paintings of this size, all for the sake of fame (naturally for vanity) and prize money. It is no wonder they want to do so, although Mr. Suzuki is not merely doing it for this reason.</p>
<p>Mr. Ihara Usaburo's "Two Figures" forms a triangle with two nude women, complemented by contrasting colors of green, blue, and red, possessing a kind of elegant and skillful technique. Mr. Ihara's style was originally somewhat similar to Picasso's, but this year's work is far from it. A clear flaw is that the entire painting has fallen into ordinary realism, gradually tending towards the official academic school. Mr. Ihara is currently ill, probably due to the exhaustion of his efforts for this difficult birth of an infant. I add this note here to wish him a speedy recovery.</p>
<p>Mr. Asai Makoto's "White Ship Entering Port" gives me infinite interest and comfort, as if I have returned to Shanghai, standing on the railing of the Bund Park by the Huangpu River. Everyone knows the famous goat painter Mr. Tsuji Hisashi of Japan, but it is a great pity that he has long been tired of being given this name and has not used goats as a subject for a long time. He exhibited a landscape painting titled "Garden" at this year's Imperial Exhibition. Although I do not have the good fortune to see the famous goats of the goat painter, I can still see a bit of the goat's interest in this small landscape painting.</p>
<p>Mr. Nakamura Fusetsu, a member of the Imperial Art Academy and the leader of the Pacific Painting Society, is a champion of the official academic school and the only writer of conceptual paintings, firmly defending his stubborn fortress and resisting the trends of the new era. People who worry about him say, "This old man always produces a Chinese historical painting at every exhibition, such as 'Lu Sheng's Dream,' 'Du Shu's Well,' 'Roasting Taro Without Answering the Envoy,' and 'Earning the Lanting Preface.' This year he produced another one called 'Su Wu's Loyalty.' At this rate, will there ever be an end to Chinese historical stories?" In fact, those who worry about him are short-sighted. China is the oldest country with thousands of years of cultural history. Why worry about not having strange historical subjects to supply him with? If he can paint fifty paintings every year, and if he can live to be five hundred years old, I think there will always be subjects to supply him with.</p>
<p>Mr. Inokuma Ichiro's "Composition" is a masterpiece that stands out in the field, with the compositional interest of Picasso and Derain.</p>
<p>In this turbid muddy pool, a large, noble white lotus grows, making people feel particularly lovely. This is Mr. Nakano and Mr. Takako's "Untitled," a masterpiece depicting Japanese rural life. The whole painting is filled with the music of lyrical poetry, and the low-key mood is a victory achieved by exploring the free world with a modern sensibility. The composition is very interesting. The horses and figures on the left, as well as the houses and trees in the background, form a small group. The standing figure and the reclining figure on the right form a large group. Then, the mountains and forests in the background and the three wooden poles in the front are connected to form a very harmonious and unified picture. Finally, the life of this masterpiece is completed with free and unrestrained brushstrokes and simple and lively colors.</p>
<p>Mr. Saito Yori's "Spring Evening" is a pastoral scene of a spring evening, but unfortunately its purpose is closer to a story and further from reality.</p>
<p>Mr. Yoshimura Yoshimatsu's "Recluse in Season" is a microcosm of an old Chinese family.</p>
<p>Mr. Sasaki Tokujiro's "Rocks" is too mired in realism, and Mr. Uenosan Seikyo's "Navigation" has too strong a load-bearing capacity of muddy colors, and the composition is childish and lacks integration. It is an unfinished work.</p>
<p>Other works include Mr. Kataoka Ginzo's "Reclining Nude," Mr. Yajima Kent's "Interior," Mr. Terauchi Manjiro's "Nude," Mr. Kakizaki Moichiro's "Sounkyo in Hokkaido," Mr. Arai Kan's "Tenpyo Statue," Mr. Ataka Angoro's "Hair," Mr. Hattori Ryohei's "Nude," Mr. Matsumura Tatsumi's "By the Window," Mr. Kumaoka Yoshihiko's "Scarlet Collection," Mr. Yoshida Hiroshi's "Sea of Clouds," Mr. Shimizu Yoshio's "Setting Sun," Mr. Koshiba Kinji's "Les Dames Aux Roses," Mr. Mikami Tomoharu's "Wolfhound," Mr. Shirakawa Ikunosuke's "Autumn Suburbs," Mr. Nagachi Shutai's "Wheat Field," Mr. Yunoki Kyuta's "Fountain," Mr. Arima Satoe's "Person Sketching," Mr. Kotera Kenkichi's "Thin Nude," Mr. Ono Takanori's "Cradle and Child," etc. Among these works, there are also good ones, but due to time constraints, I cannot introduce them one by one, which is really a pity. If there is an opportunity in the future, I will bring them up again and discuss them with you in detail. Now, this tour of the Western Painting Section of the Imperial Exhibition comes to an end here.</p>
<h3 id="e208">New Trends in American Literary Circles <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>(Continued from the Third) Translated by Anping</p>
<p>Therefore, in this light, it is not surprising that American writers praise and admire England, just as DOWNING STREET (magazine name) discusses American finance, and London magazines discuss the standards and decisions of today's critics. If an American writer is recognized by England, he will immediately become an international celebrity. He not only gains his reputation, but also gains something in tangible terms. In any case, he always gets the glory. Naturally, this part of the relationship is entirely psychologically influenced, but their reputation is still undeniable. Only those writers who write for another kind of reader, such as the American pioneers Whitman and MacThane, who have a soul about national borders, only those writers can not be influenced by that British air. However, since the international status of the United States in the world has risen, this influence has gradually decreased. In the past, American literature did not have its own status, because the United States did not have its own full status among the Western countries. It was a growing country, but it was not yet fully grown. As soon as the international status of the United States changed, this situation immediately changed, and the psychology of the country also changed. Gradually, American writers felt that American literature must have its own place and should be connected with its (country). At such a time, Whitman and MacThane were recognized by those literary artists and critics. Perhaps if the United States had not joined the World War and had not taken over the leadership of the world from Britain, this transformation would still not have been successful. But in any case, the British air left to the United States has at least reached its end. From that time on, American literature, filled with a new force, was liberated from the old shackles. He has deep faith in his own talent and does not feel that there is anything more praiseworthy than carving out their new destiny.</p>
<p>What is the nature of this new destiny? Who are the representatives of this new wave? In the aspect of poetry, we see them in what they call the (literary radical hall). They represent this new atmosphere in their own special style. Those poets such as Lowell (AMY LOWELL), Frost (ROBERT FIOST), Sandburg (CARL SANDEERG), Lindsay (VACHELL LINDSAY), Jeffers (ROBINSON JEFFERS), and Masters (EDGAR MEE MASTERS) are all writers of this kind. But these writers, whether directly or indirectly, are all influenced by Whitman's poetry to some extent. No one can transfer the names of British model writers to them as a kind of praise. They are all very obviously and completely American. Even Lowell, although he is deeply influenced by the British atmosphere, his emotions still do not escape the memories of Montresor and roses, but he also joined the anti-British rebellion like a MIDWESTERN poet. In fact, her enthusiastic advocacy of the new trend in modern poetry has not been of much help and strength to the revival of American poetry. In the same situation as Lowell are two women, one named Monroe (HARRIER MONROE), who gathered a large group of rebellious poets of this era in her magazine "Poetry," and the other named Anderson (MARGARET ANDERSON), who also worked hard in her "Little Magazine" (THE LITTLE REVIEW) in the same way as Monroe, but what she worked hard on was not poetry but prose.</p>
<p>But these poets only expressed the American background in their personal will. Their actions are completely personal and not social. This is the reason why the challenger of Whitman's old poetry style can overcome the new school. As in the poems of Cummings (EECUMMINGS) and Stein (GEITRIDE SEIN), individualism is revealed so strongly that it almost completely becomes a desperate exorcism symbol (ABRACADABRA). But in any case, on the whole, the poems of Sandburg, Frost, Robinson, Lindsay, and Masters all contain a balance of external and internal elements. According to the American situation, these new poets who show contempt for their personal conflicts in theory and technique unanimously oppose Howell's words ("The more obvious and active the spirit is in life, the more it can be said to be an American"). They feel that what is presented in the United States now is not a bit of ("active spirit of life"), but a bit of expansion of land. The United States is now becoming the leading country in the world, a global power. But in what point can he show his power? On the machine, in the invention, in the goods, a country revolving on the axis of steam and steel. But what things have been encountered in the individual's soul? He will be destroyed when he will be destroyed in the preliminary proceedings, and the spirit of this individualism in the literary rebellion will eventually be sacrificed and tend to the aspect of the group's function.</p>
