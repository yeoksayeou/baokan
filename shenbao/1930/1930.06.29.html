<p>赴日考察經過詳情</p>
<p>六大都市人口調查</p>
<p>市財政之整齊劃一</p>
<p>日本改造民族一斑</p>
<p>前京市財政局長金國實奉巿府令派赴日考察市財政業已歸國返京金專員現將在日考察所得從事整理約十日内始可脫稿即將貢獻政府採納以爲改革我國市財政之參考日日社記者昨訪金氏于私邸叩以此行攷察之所得告之甚詳爰摘要如下</p>
<p>人口之調查本人奉派赴日考察市財政抵日後頗受各地市政府之殷勤招待日本自發生地震後亟圖恢復其建設事業之猛進殊非常人所及料全國有六大都市（一）東京（二）大阪（三）京都（即西京）（四）神户（五）名古屋（六）横濱管理市政之政府在日稱爲市役所直轄於縣府此與我國［市］的地位不同之點但市長之人選完全民治不由政府委派由全市市民選舉於是市長之聲望及才能多超越縣長之上故市的行政範甲亦頗廣大六大都市最近人口估計之數如下（一）東京二·二一八·四○○（二）大阪二·三三三·八○○（三）名古屋九四九·九六六（四）京都七三六·○○○（五）神户七一七·七七一（六）横濱五六五·三○八</p>
<p>財政之整齊</p>
<p>日本地方財政之一切規程整齊劃一總樞紐在中央之大藏省内務省市財政一切之設施惟視大藏内務兩省命令是遵如創辦新添之稅捐非經中央之核准决不施行故市財政一切之收支頗有條序關於建設部份在地震後於内務省附設一復興局市内復興工作由復興局與市役所酙酌工程之大小分别擔任惟日本地稅仍用三四十年以前之地價爲標準似不甚公平質之日人則謂日政府年來抱緊縮政策以舉行一項調查需用經費頗鉅云又日政府自地震後努力建設現在之東京不特回復舊觀亦且益臻美備幾可與華盛頓巴黎等相頡頏其復與工作中之最足供吾人參考者厥爲土地區劃整理問題將另撰一文以報告於國人也</p>
<p>此行之感想再本人此行對日本民族之發展事業之猛進令人生無限之感想我國素譏日本人材之矮小日政府年來改造民族提倡體育其進步之速度殊足令人咋知老年者或有矮小之人而二三十歲以下者身材魁梧精神奮發女子亦手大脚粗萬非我中華女子所能望其項背我國若再不提倡體育改良人種則國際競爭勝敗之數無待善能矣云</p>

<p>越是聰敏的人越是没有主張所以他的不如意事常比蠢笨的人爲多</p>
<p>情塲奮鬥好比軍閥交閧終有勝利或流血的一天</p>
<p>莘莘學子爲國家未來之主人翁其重要不减於花稻之有關國計民生但政府培植學子之心也要和農夫愛護花稻之心一樣的深切才好　　衣上汚了一點墨水都要急於洗條暗中作了一件惡事莫不怡然自得所以人心叵測世道崎嶇</p>
<p>不是米貴不知儉約不是國恥不知自强被動的興奮效力之之微也可想而知了</p>
<p>靑年們在求學時都想將來做一番轟轟烈烈的事業及至出了校門不是做喪權辱國的軍閥就是做搜括地皮的官吏不是做爲虎作倀的奸商就是做運米出口的蝥賊一半果然經濟逼人的緣故一半還是惑於環境不良的引誘吧</p>
<p>兹善家祗知求生命不知重衛生所以每逢夏令有救不勝救疲於奔走之苦　　你於暑天宴客本是善意也許變爲惡意因爲他們擾了你多量董歷的東西容易生病所以暑天還是屏絶宴會爲妙</p>
<p>一個人在夏令欲免病魔侵襲祗消睡眠時不要過凉飲食時切忌生冷並謝絶各種宴會那就行了</p>

<h3 id="c81">莫悉湖上 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>春潮</p>
<p>莫悉湖在首都水西門外相傳爲京中四十八景之最優者余近往一游覺其境味雖簡雋而殊不逮玄武湖之博麗俟爽然當夕陽無限好之時坐此持茗清談亦人生一樂也</p>
<p>管有兹湖之寺廟名華嚴庵其中重樓複閣建築頗佳正中爲鬱金堂上爲勝棋樓考之舊史徐達與明太祖嘗於此賭弈達勝太祖即以兹湖歸之達死後湖産仍屬於徐氏後人至今有數百年之久近聞京市政府業已徵收爲公有華嚴庵和尙都被逐去而另給徐氏後裔以代價萬餘元改組爲莫悉湖公園敎育局財政局各派一職員駐此管理一切故湖上近來頗饒有官氣也</p>
<p>由鬱金堂側門曲折空一迥攔至曾公閣此處看湖最爲蕭爽令人胸宇廓然余是日與秦王諸君偕即就此茗坐時暮色微籠落日已匿於山後湖上風光皆爲澹化對面之清凉山視之尚了了城墉如帶襯托極美余等談笑指點直至他客散盡始行視時計已七時許矣</p>
<p>聞莫愁湖看荷景味最厚余等往游未逢其時頗引爲憾事同時感覺此爲近水之景而不能泛舟以視玄武湖之可打漿中流宜其吸引游客之力景較遜也然湖上建築大有西湖别莊之風味且聯語極多佳者亦夥余忽忽一覽僅憶某君聯云人喚莫愁湖喚莫愁天下事愁原不少王腚有像候宜有像眼中人像此無多覺頗靈雋可誦</p>
<p>隣莫愁湖有粤軍公墓係犧牲於民元建國之役者中植總理手書一碑文曰建國成仁旁有兩巨碑似爲譚組庵汪精衛等所撰之墓銘字已漫漶不可識此墓在軍閥專政時代地方官並不注意及之故頽垣蔓草充滿其間自革命軍克復京城乃稍稍加以修葺新修一亭並於碑道前增石闌一道然以無人董理仍覺荒凉萬狀也</p>
<p>以余周游京中名勝之經騐言之清凉山巔宜瞰京城全景靈谷寺宜作琵克臬克之野會玄武湖宜月夜泛舟而莫愁湖則宜秋晨看雨不識京華游客亦有與余同感者否</p>

<p>然男女制度之難解决同於馬克斯高倡之經濟問題余昔晋人語我曰吾地有一俗諺江南人中舉先刻原卷山西人中舉先娶姨太由此可見中國之俗不論富貴男姓一朝得志未有不縱其性欲者矣而同時仍以三從四德之道德津其妻妾若一切道德廉恥專爲女性設者爲不可解也不過性問題之難解决等於經濟問題西洋不用妾制則以自由離婚代之最近至以自由戀愛制代之事實上變動更大不過較東方爲平等耳我佛乃立一出家制太高難行行者多失敗而佛敎在中國合於儒之多妻制佛在靑海西藏又合於藏俗之多夫制然則佛在西洋亦必合乎自由戀愛之情人制矣大哉我佛門廣大豈拘一格哉將來能解脫一切者其蒙古之歡喜佛制耶</p>

<p>斅厂</p>
<p>諺云夏至楊梅滿山紅現正夏至之候故楊梅又上市矣</p>
<p>吾浙産生楊梅最著之區則爲浙西之塘樓與夫浙東之諸曁他若餘姚肖山等處亦産此物惟所産遠不及塘諸二處之多且佳也</p>
<p>塘諸二處之楊梅質旣不同味亦有異蓋塘棲所産者以炭梅爲多實大粒粗核小汁多味極甘確爲佳品而諸曁所産者實小有蒂粒細核粗汁少而甜食之有鮮味此爲塘棲産所不及惟成熟時期較遲須塘棲産過市後方可採摘也楊梅在枝頭成熟時彌覺可觀蓋葉緑果紅望之若彩輿然</p>
<p>塘棲楊梅當其在枝頭成熟時行人過此可隨意啖食物主見而不之禁惟食時不得以手摘下須以口就枝頭而啖若摘之以手即被視爲偷竊蓋楊梅之表面有芒採下後須以掌輕輕磨去其芒方可多食否則多食數枚則口内之頣舌即爲芒所傷矣</p>
<p>楊梅核有消滅吾人腹中毛髮之功用故啖楊梅者年必嚥下數枚而武康南鄉人之啖楊梅也所啖無論多寡悉將其核呑下此又啖食楊梅之異聞也</p>

<p>民智中學將編印五週紀念册囑余爲序余維［民智］爲滬西有數之私立學校成績卓著久爲滬西人士所信仰溯是［民智］成立歷時不過五載觀其發展之速可謂一日千里將來進步正未可限量也</p>
<p>夫學校在財政及管理方而言之雖有公私之分敎育的目的則一也滬租界學齡兒童衆多工部局所辦之學校寥寥無幾市立學校亦不多觀所頼以供給租界之敎育需要者惟私立學　而已矣故私立學校在滬租界所負之敎育責任最爲重要</p>
<p>敎育爲立國之根本今我國旣以三民主義建設國家則敎育宗旨自應以三民主義爲依歸刻下收回租界敎育樓之聲浪正高所以如此者爲求三民主義敎育之實現也［民智］成立未久成績斐然將來努力發展前途未可限量吾願主持校務諸公於三民主義敎育之實現特别注意使設備課程敎學法課外作業及其他設施皆與三民主義之敎育原旨符合以爲租界敎育之模範則不獨［民智］之幸亦敎育之幸也</p>

<p>爲本校五週紀念進一　　辭　　（戴琅華）</p>
<p>中國現在還談不到敎育二字因爲一般人根本没有了解求智的必要資産　級和無産階級懸殊一般富人倚賴他的遣産和勢力依食住行可以不必謀求以爲讀書是苦事那知不給子女讀書正好像不許他走自新的路一樣至於貧人家呢衣食住行還不能顧及那裏再有錢來供給讀書呢所以兩方面的結果都等於無智識旣然人民智識不普及國從那裏强呢因此國之强盛全在人民智識的發達</p>
<p>所以我們應當先向本校二位校長道謝並且慶祝他們成功本校自開辦以來已經五年逕過許多困難才得到五年的榮譽和社會的信仰我們應感謝他們爲未來的一般國民立一個穩固的基礎去抵禦列强的壓迫提倡民智使中國轉弱爲强還有一種精神更使是們佩服的就是二位校長不惜犧牲精神和金錢爲社會國家謀幸福爲敎育界的先驅過去事蹟已經建立我們應當更須努力進求未來的希望本師生合作的精神一方面師長熱心敎詢學生當以未來國民爲念而學生呢更要在學校内養成優美的學問高尙的人格强健的體格作將來主人翁的準備達到最後的目標這是我對於我校五週紀念的一點希望</p>

<p>我也可說就讀本校的五周紀念但是本校在這五年之中多麽的進步我呢雖然小學升到中學只因資質愚魯决不像本校的進步有一日千里之勢這是我所問心自愧的但是我眼看着本校初創時期而人於完美時期在五年中本校慘淡經營才有這樣五年後的今日是多麽值得我們歡呼和欣躍</p>

<p>在這樣一轉瞬當兒能够建設了這樣堅固的</p>
<p>基礎博得社會上相當的聲譽那五百餘的師友躋躋蹌蹌那寬大爽朗的校舍氣慨雄偉這不是全靠這一轉瞬的功夫嗎這不更是全靠這一轉瞬中熱心的工作者嗎</p>
<p>我們回顧到那初創始時的寥寥數人我們回顧到那前幾年時的景像在那時我們决不會預料到今日的一日我們更没有敢斷定本校無限的前途正在隨時光而競進呵</p>
<p>努力設教</p>
<p>劉湛息題</p>
<p>五年是過去了過去的事蹟是早已彰彰在人耳目過去的事蹟是永不會消滅我們不但同慶現在我們還要預視將來</p>
<p>固然以從前論到現在以現在預測將來是很有無限的前途在本校未來的偉大必萬倍於今日我們同祝本校萬歲</p>
<p>我們對於本校五週紀念要說的話（江念劬</p>
<p>中小學幼稚園第十届女生影（王開攝）</p>
<p>在這被帝國主義壓迫之下的中國因經濟困難的原故所以未受敎育的人十分多但是並非没有補救的方法呀而我們中國雖然對於敎育的設施已有相當的計劃而對於指導讀書的人材知是十分缺少因此敎育不能和世界各國並駕齊驅本校的二位創辦人對於敎育十分熱心他們想挽救我們的國家解决人民不識字的痛苦而而創辦這個學校命名是民智即開通民智的意思</p>
<p>在那艱難困苦的當中已不知不覺的過了五年了在這五週之中創辦人和各位先生的熱心努力得到很好的成績再有在這租界上辦學校是何等爲難而二位創辦人却依創辦人却依着總理的大無畏精神不屈不撓造成租界中華人自辦學校的良好基礎這種人材眞值得我佩服再有在過去的五年中本校的氣象十分好像校中的同學對於學業皆有競爭心理同學對於愛國運動也十分熱心更有一種特點與他校不同就是同學所穿的衣服皆非常清潔樸素没一點出風頭的思想完全是平民化這種狀態以後的同學應永遠保存着不要再過一個五週紀念校中的學生都變成貴族化了現在本校有一困難之處本校應在最短的期間快快解决的就是校舍問題希望建築一個廣大的校舍那末本校一天一天發達起來同學也一天一天的增加起來而校舍却没有擁擠的狀態並且自已造了校舍不必再出鉅額的房錢把這筆欵子移充建設方面豈不是好就是同學讀書也比較安心一點了然而這鉅大的欵項由何而來呢一定要請國内熱心敎育的人來出一點力促成本校啟發民智的主張這就是我所要說的幾句話了</p>
<p>今後本校應具之精神　　洪繁君</p>
<p>上海學校林立但良莠不一致鑒别無後每趨向敎會學校者以中國辦學者每不以爲國儲才爲方針而以個人利害爲轉移故敎育之阻塞也如故今本校校長有鑒于此專心誠意自辦學校積多年之經驗本平生之目的于十四年春設備一小規模之學校開辦之初一切殊未能與别校爭雄以心餘面力不足也但以校長不斷之努力與各敎授之熱心敎詢而來學者日衆聲譽漸隆校舍日廣内則設備漸趨完善外則講演每獲優勝五年之成績殊有足觀者但百年樹人區區五年豈能限制無窮之敎育事業後來之發　雖可根據五年之成績要亦在校長之繼續努力也本校旣有過去之成績殊不難登峯造極使外學不能盛行學子知所趨向爲收回租界敎育權之先驅足則於此紀念中所應具之精神也</p>

<p>我們的校長</p>
<p>這幾天的報上很忙的登着各學校的畢業禮我們學校裏從來没有發表過一點關於文藝上的作品和討論敎育方面的種種問題列談不到什麽畢業禮了一切都入於沉默的態度中也没有發展的期望了學校裏的學生用功的雖然也不少但是大半是抱糢糊主義的她們求學的目的是因爲没有事做讀書是消遣罷了（我也是學生並不是有意毁壞她們）要知兩江女體畢業生尹維華（長烈攝）</p>
<p>道目前中國的形勢我們有了機會求學的學生應該趕緊的努力前進爲社會謀生産爲民族謀出路向那光社之路走呢我們的校長她雖則有一種好像限和氣的笑容但一點也没有替學生們增進智識和康健的動作體育方面收了學生的運動費也没有運動的設備又没有正式的圖書館不過幾本不三不四的英文和幾本翻譯的中國小說而已尋不出一本對於學生有益的雜誌這便算給我們做參考的講到所請的敎員除出一二個懂敎授法的其餘的都是爲着解决他們的生活問題而來的像這種的學校我是已經錯走了</p>
<p>學校的宗旨中英文是並重的那末畢業的時候當然也應該一樣的時遇但是她並不是這樣的英文班的畢業同學都是神氣活現的坐在臺上一個一個的發文憑我們中文畢業的同學都立在門外我不是爲了拿文憑起見其實像我們拿一張差不多等於廢紙的文憑有什麽用處不過校長雖則是基督敎的信徒她並不是外國人呵</p>
<p>敬告轉學的同學們如其進一個學校一定要詳細考慮學校的内容我們是要得着實際上的學說不是研究外貌的（竺筠）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Declaration of the Annual Meeting of the Little Entente <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The establishment of the Little Entente, including Czechoslovakia, was to prevent the aggression of Germany, Austria, and Hungary. Although Germany and Austria had just been defeated at that time,</p>
<p>everyone was uneasy, fearing their resurgence and difficulty in controlling them. Therefore, the emerging small countries in Central Europe were surrounded by Germany, Austria, and Hungary, and their territories were mostly ceded from Germany, Austria, and Hungary. They could not but worry about future dangers and urgently seek self-consolidation. This is how the three Little Entente countries came into being. Moreover, at that time, the major Entente powers that had defeated Germany and Austria expressed sympathy for the Little Entente, thinking of using it as a future assistance, but they also had doubts about the ambition of the Little Entente and worried about being constrained in the future. The environment of the Little Entente countries was such that their safety depended entirely on the changing situation.</p>
<p>Fortunately, peace in Central Europe could be relied upon for mutual security. Once something happened, there would be a fear of being dragged into the vortex. Therefore, over the years, they have been diligently working on the one hand to connect with other weak and small countries suffering from the same ailment, and on the other hand, running between the two major powers, hoping to avoid isolation. Dealing with the situation was extremely difficult. Now, the major European powers are all sharpening their swords and striving for progress. Regardless of the previously defeated or victorious parties, they are all thinking of how to take advantage of the times and manipulate situations to place their own countries in a advantageous position. Therefore, it will be difficult for the European continent to maintain this peaceful situation in the future. The coming of storms is unpredictable, and the Little Entente countries, for the sake of preparing for the future, must also make some preparations. At this annual meeting of the Little Entente, the three foreign ministers, based on the experience of the past eleven years, specially signed a draft charter declaration, declaring the consolidation of the three countries' alliance, which is probably also to show that they are prepared to deal with the changing times.</p>

<p>Beijing: Wang replied to Chen Gongbo's younger brother that he had never participated in politics or the military, and that he took party unity as his stand. Everything else was negotiable. If the northern comrades unanimously supported party unity, he could still go north at any time. He concluded by saying that what we have been running around and appealing for over the years is only the point of unifying the party. If even this is sacrificed, then the revolution would be meaningless. Comrade Liming loves the party and the country most deeply and sincerely, and will surely accept my humble words.

<p>Tianjin Customs Incident</p>
<p>Nanjing: Regarding the Tianjin Customs incident, according to foreign sources, the Japanese side has proposed a solution to have Bellot continue to serve as the commissioner of the Tianjin Customs, and to deposit the tax revenue, after paying off the internal and external debts secured by the tax, in the banks affiliated with Nanjing, Shanghai, and Beiping. The funds would be dealt with after the end of the military affairs. This news was spread by the Japanese Consulate in Beijing, but inquiries to the Customs have not confirmed it. As for the Qinhuangdao sub-customs, which originally belonged to the Tianjin Customs, it was ordered to be closed at the same time, but in fact it was not easy to do so. Now, the order has been issued to change the sub-customs to be under the management of Shanhaiguan. As for the new Tianjin Customs measures announced by Simpson on the 27th, the tax silver should be deposited in this Customs after the valuation of the pledged goods, and receipts should be issued. Merchants should reclaim the Tianjin Customs tax silver paid at the first port of entry themselves. If they cannot be reclaimed, they should submit the tax certificates to this Customs for negotiation, and the tax paid can be refunded in full with the deposit receipt. According to those familiar with the situation, this method has other intentions. The part of the Tianjin Customs tax that secures the debt</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>is usually remitted to the Shanghai HSBC Bank once a week. The notice orders merchants who have paid Tianjin Customs tax at the first port of entry to submit the tax evidence to the Customs, ostensibly to be refunded in the future, but it is feared that at that time, this tax evidence will be used to offset the internal and external debts, and no further remittances will be made, in order to cleverly resist and achieve the purpose of seizing customs revenue. The authorities are still working on a solution to this. (Special telegram on the 28th)</p>

<p>Revolutionary Army's Momentum is Strong</p>
<p>Bloody Battles Continue in Bolivian Capital</p>
<p>Entire Country Falls Under Control</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 27th: A telegram from the Argentine capital stated that the revolutionary army in Bolivia has apparently taken control of the entire country. It is reported that apart from bloody battles in the Bolivian capital, the rest of the country is peaceful.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Anito Chujus Taite, 27th: According to unverified news from the Bolivian capital, the remnants of the besieged government army have surrendered to the revolutionary army.

<p>Japan-Russia Fisheries Dispute</p>
<p>Japanese Fishing Boats Invade Russian Territory, Attacked</p>
<p>Japanese Side Outraged, Plans to File Strong Protest</p>
<p>Japan Alliance, Hakodate, 27th: On the Kamchatka front, the Japanese fishing boat Ryoto Maru, belonging to the post-fishing business, was suspected by the Russian authorities of invading Russian territory. On the 24th, it was suddenly attacked by a Russian surveillance ship, and one fisherman was shot and killed. The Japanese authorities sent the surveillance ship Shuntoku Maru to the area to investigate the truth and rescue the fishermen.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 28th: According to newspapers, the conflict between Japanese fishermen and the Soviet Russian authorities over fishing rights in the waters off Kamchatka has been going on for a long time and has now deteriorated. On the 24th of this month, a Japanese crab boat was bombarded by a Soviet Russian patrol boat off the coast of western Kamchatka without warning, killing one person and detaining the rest. They have not been released yet. This news has been verified by political circles here. It is reported that a Japanese destroyer sailed out on the 26th with secret orders, apparently heading to Kamchatka.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 28th: The Soviet Russian surveillance ship Koroskogoi fired on the 24th at the Japanese crab fishing boat No. 2 Mikuni Maru (19 tons), which was operating outside the territorial waters of the Shavran Bay. Crew member Mizushima died of injuries, three fishermen were seriously injured, and the other eleven crew members were forcibly pulled to a nearby island to land. The Japanese destroyer Matsukaze heard the alarm and immediately set off from the Ominato Naval Base to the scene to rescue the fishermen who had been killed and injured, and to protect and guard the Japanese fishing boats fishing nearby. The port of Hakodate, the base of the hired boats, is currently in a state of great tension, demanding a thorough investigation and a resolute response to this atrocity. The government is also planning to conduct an investigation and then take the most serious diplomatic measures against the Soviet Russian government.</p>

<p>Old Documents Discovered in US Navy Department Archives</p>
<p>Proposal for League of Nations Land and Naval Forces Plan</p>
<p>Geneva Side Scoffs, Calling It Absurd</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 27th: A document was discovered in the Navy Department archives today entitled "Plan for Building a League of Nations International Alliance of Land and Naval Forces." Secretary of State Stimson, upon hearing of this, wrote to Senator Bora, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stating that this had never been discussed at the London Naval Conference and that the American representatives attending the conference were unaware of this document. Navy Secretary Adams stated that the document was drafted in Versailles during the negotiation of the peace treaty and was prepared to be brought to Paris.</p>
<p>National Communist Party, Geneva, 27th: Regarding the news from Washington that US President Hoover intends to have a memorandum proposing the organization of the League of Nations land and naval forces, the League of Nations side scoffed at it, calling it absurd and saying that this was propaganda spread by the opposition during the US Senate's discussion of the London Naval Treaty.</p>
<p>Dealing With the Vietnam Incident</p>
<p>French Radical Party Moves to Reject</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 27th: After the House of Representatives discussed the Vietnam issue today, it rejected the Radical Party's motion to establish a governing committee by a vote of 305 to 260, and passed a vote of confidence in the government, believing that the government could eradicate communism in Vietnam and deal with the Vietnamese people with the inherent generosity and justice of France.</p>
<p>World Society Says: The French court has disbanded the Union of Vietnamese Students in France because of demonstrations, as seen in this newspaper on the 27th. The following is a report from Paris on the activities of Vietnamese students: The activities of the Vietnamese party are increasingly expanding. France's future in Vietnam is no different from England's in India and America's in the Philippines. The French government is quite panicked, but maintains a calm attitude on the surface and decides to use harsh methods to suppress it. France has occupied Vietnam for fifty years, and the Vietnamese have never sincerely submitted. Internal strife has arisen from time to time. In recent years, the young intellectual class has, in light of world trends, demanded independence. The momentum of independence is growing. Many of the party's activities are set up in hinterlands where French troops cannot reach, and there is nothing France can do. However, the origin of the revolutionary movement is in Paris. France used a policy of appeasement and sent hundreds of Vietnamese youths to Paris universities to study, intending to give them official positions after graduation for their colonial government. However, these youths are never tempted by profit and fame and never assimilate with France. In their spare time from studying, they secretly plan for the independence of their motherland. Recently, they tried to attack the French presidential palace, and their courage is astonishing. They also secretly publish a revolutionary newspaper in Paris, which has been published for two years. The French police strictly investigate the printing house that prints it, but to no avail. The leader of the party is only twenty-five years old and is in contact with the French Communist Party. Whenever the Communist Party holds demonstrations, he always participates holding a red flag. The French government is struggling to deal with these youths. If they are allowed to return to Vietnam, the local revolutionary movement will be more inflamed. If they are left in Paris, they must be provided with tuition and cannot be prevented from graduating forever. The Taydio cabinet is hesitating about this matter.</p>
<p>Little Entente Annual Meeting Concludes</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia and Romania Jointly Issue Declaration</p>

The foreign ministers of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia signed a declaration stating that the alliance of the three countries is consolidated and claiming that a charter of the Little Entente has been drafted based on the experience of the past eleven years as a guideline for future cooperation. It is widely speculated by political and diplomatic circles here that the three foreign ministers will have a strong opposition to the news of the Habsburgs' plan to restore the monarchy, but this time it was not mentioned to the public, which is quite surprising.</p>

<p>National Communist Party, Madrid, 27th: Malaga has declared martial law today. The strike by dockworkers and construction workers is tantamount to rioting, causing all shops in the city to close. Hundreds of tourists in the country have flocked back to the ships. Strike leaders have been arrested, and police have issued notices strictly prohibiting riots.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Shandong Provincial Government Moves Office to Qingdao <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Due to changes in military strategy and in deference to the requests of consuls from various countries stationed in Jinan, the Shandong military and central army will no longer engage in combat near Jinan. From the night of the 24th, Han Fuqu ordered his troops to be transferred to the Jiaoji Railway line. The acting Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, Zhu Xi, and committee members Yuan Jiapu, He Siyuan, Yu Enbo, Cui Shijie, Chen Luanshu, Chen Mingyu, as well as important officials of the provincial government, also arrived in Qingdao at 6:00 AM on the 25th on a special train. Those who came together included the Mayor of Jinan, Zhao Jingshi, and the Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, Li Erkang. After arriving in Qingdao, the committee members temporarily borrowed a portion of Qingdao University's buildings to establish a temporary office and continue to perform the functions of the provincial government. They telegraphed the county magistrates, instructing them to continue to be responsible for all duties and report at any time. They also telegraphed the Central Government for instructions. The two telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Central Government: The province of Shandong has declared that Chairman Chen has been ordered to go to the front lines to supervise the troops, and the military affairs of the entire province are entirely the responsibility of Commander-in-Chief Han. Han's troops have fought hard for over a month, repeatedly thwarting the enemy's advance. Recently, the enemy has launched a full-scale offensive, and the situation has changed abruptly. Han's troops began to retreat on the Yangri River. The official residence has a duty to defend, but there is no way to defend itself. After repeated deliberation, the Jinan Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief Gong Weijiang was instructed to be responsible for protecting the security of Chinese and foreign people in the city. The provincial government and its affiliated offices were ordered to assign personnel to be responsible for the safekeeping of documents and affairs. On the day (the 25th), at Chou time, the troops moved out of Jinan. Due to an obstacle on the Pingpu Railway line, troops were prepared to be used between Qingwei, so the government moved to Qingdao and temporarily stayed in a part of Qingdao University. The officials are inept and have lost the county seat, feeling deeply guilty and awaiting punishment. We believe that although northern Shandong and Jinan have unfortunately fallen, the order in the east, west, and south sides is still safe, and the political power needs to be unified. Moreover, the enemy's hasty invasion has not solidified its foundations, and Han's troops still have strength. We urgently wish to counterattack. If the central army provides immediate reinforcements, the strong city can be restored. Before receiving clear orders, we will temporarily continue to perform the functions of the provincial government in Qingdao, maintaining the hearts of the people of the entire province who desire governance and supporting the Central Government's determination of the great cause. Should the Shandong Provincial Government Administrative Office be established in Qingdao, or should we take the sea route to Jinjing and transfer to Yanzhou and Jining to follow the troops and promote their effectiveness to redeem ourselves? We await your instructions and will obey. Telegram to the counties: The various committee members of this government are following the troops. The previous telegram should have arrived. We have now moved to Qingdao City and established a temporary office in Qingdao University. The magistrates of each city and county should be actively responsible for all duties. If there are reports, they should be sent directly to the temporary office as needed (June 25th).</p>
<h3 id="e4">The War in Fujian Province Is About to Erupt Again <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The Navy and Army Are Preparing to Advance and Suppress Lu's Troops</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since Lu's troops were completely defeated by Liu's troops in the Fujian province war, Liu's troops have only guarded the important mountain tops on the northwest two roads and have not advanced. For a time, a stalemate was formed. Everyday, naval seaplanes are sent to the enemy's position to drop bombs and warn them. Lu's troops are disturbed by this, and their morale is shaken. The troops stationed along the Minjiang River in the Ganzhe, Zhuqi, and Baisha areas have mostly retreated into the mountainous forests of the inland Yuangou, Dahu, and Xiaoluo villages for concealment. (Lu Xingrong's command post has also been moved from Baisha to Xiaoluo.) There is also no preparation for a counterattack. Therefore, it is widely rumored in society that the National Government has sent a telegram to Fujian ordering both sides to cease fighting first and wait for someone to be sent to investigate and then resolve the matter politically. Therefore, the general public is hopeful for peace, especially the merchants, who are the most eager. However, in the past three days, the situation has suddenly changed again. The National Government has clearly ordered the deprivation of Lu Xingbang's official position and ordered the navy and army to jointly suppress him. On the one hand, Chairman Jiang telegraphed Liu Heding to commend the officers and soldiers of his troops for repelling the rebellious masses and to encourage them to continue their efforts to eliminate the rebellious atmosphere. Various guns, ammunition, and special military equipment for mountain warfare requested by Liu's troops have been successively transported. A group of Northwest Army prisoners of war has been specially sent to Fujian to be incorporated into Liu's troops to supplement their strength. The division plans to reorganize these prisoners of war into a supplementary brigade, with Jiang Yan, the regimental commander who has been the most effective in supervising the battle on the northern road, promoted to brigade commander. Together with the original three brigades of Gui Zhenyuan, Liu Shangzhi, and Chen Wantai, there will be a total of four brigades, plus an artillery regiment, an engineering regiment, a machine gun battalion, and a special service battalion, with a total strength of over 22,000 men. At the same time, the ordnance of each battalion will be completely replenished. The machine guns and mortars have been the most effective in this operation. Each battalion is specially equipped with three machine guns and two mortars, and the wartime configuration has now been completed. As for the navy, the Central Government has clearly ordered the suppression of Lu, and it has joined forces with Liu's troops to advance in three routes: left, middle, and right. The left route will advance from Nangang to Yongtai, led by the navy. The middle route will advance from Beiling to Gutian, and the right route will advance from Xixiang to Minqing, both led by Liu's troops. Since the 22nd, Liu's troops have been successively moving the majority of the troops stationed in the city out of the northwest city to Beiling and Baisha. The navy also believes that the two existing seaplanes are insufficient and has specially transferred Chen Wenlin, the director of the Xiamen Naval Aircraft Office, to lead two fighter planes to the province to assist in the battle. They will arrive within three days, and the Donghu barracks has been designated as a temporary airport. Lu's troops have learned that the provincial authorities are about to launch a major offensive, so they have intercepted all the ships and sailboats traveling to and from the upper reaches of the provincial capital, prohibiting them from sailing downstream to cut off transportation, and have concentrated their forces below Shuikou to block the advance of the provincial troops. According to investigations, Lu's troops have now concentrated all their forces in the front to participate in the battle, including the five brigades of Lu Xinglao, Lu Xinming, Chen Rongbiao, Zhou Zhiqun, and Chen Guocai (the one who rebelled in Wuhu earlier). Only one brigade of Lu Xingming is defending the rear, which is not enough. However, the people in the northwest countryside of the province had successively moved back after the ceasefire on the 13th. Now that they see the tense situation, they have moved into the city again since the 22nd, carrying boxes and burdens, supporting the old and carrying the young, one after another (24th).</p>
<h3 id="e5">The War in Fujian Affects Upstream Freight <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Upstream Business Circles Write to the General Chamber of Commerce to Appeal</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Liu Heding's troops are now very active in their combat plans due to the central government's order to suppress Lu. Yesterday, an order was issued to all units to replenish any deficiencies in addition to the original military supplies, and high terrain was acquired in the Dabeiling area to set up fortifications. However, the various upstream river transport merchant guilds have written to the General Chamber of Commerce and the Commercial Research Institute to forward to the authorities, requesting that they find a way to restore traffic, as the military has affected freight transport and commerce is in crisis. In general, those who specialize in the upstream business are the first to bear the brunt of the river blockage and suffer the greatest losses, but the losses suffered by the upstream business are no less than the losses suffered by the provincial business, because the upstream business and the provincial business are related to each other. The upstream merchants' business, in addition to their own capital, is generally borrowed from provincial merchants for lending, advance payment, exchange, etc. The various goods are sold in the province to offset the debt to return the provincial merchants. Otherwise, the upstream business will be hurt, affecting the whole system, such as banks, money merchants, north-south shipping, tea, wood, paper, bamboo shoots, new goods, salt, rice, passenger transport, and river transport merchants, which are the limbs of the upstream business. The river transport is the most prosperous in the fourth, fifth, and sixth months. The blockage of the river during this peak season is a dangerous situation. I hope that the giants of the city's business community will quickly find a way to provide relief. Fortunately, the upstream and downstream transport ships have been opened, and those that are blocked along the way, such as rice, tea, wood, salt, paper, bamboo shoots, dried fruits, fish, cloth, flour, oil, grain, foreign goods, and other bulk goods, as well as postal drafts that are blocked along the way, amount to no less than hundreds of thousands of yuan. After the exact figures have been investigated, they will be reported.</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Case of Japanese Soldiers Crushing Yang Ruiwen Is Resolved <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The case of Japanese soldiers stationed in Hankou driving an unlicensed car at 2:00 PM on the 10th of this month and crushing Yang Ruiwen, a sergeant squad leader of the General Headquarters Hankou Camp, in the French Concession has been resolved after repeated negotiations by the municipal government. The Japanese side has acknowledged the three items of apology, compensation, and punishment of the murderer. Today (the 27th), it was officially resolved. The details of the negotiations in this case are recorded below. After the incident occurred, the camp immediately sent a letter to the municipal government requesting serious negotiations with the Japanese consulate. The original letter stated: "Our camp soldier Zhao Ruiwen was killed instantly at 2:00 PM on June 10th while on official duty in the French Concession by a reckless Japanese military vehicle. Cases involving Chinese and foreign nationals in Hankou are now handled by your government. The body of the soldier has been examined by the court and is still at the scene of the incident. The offending vehicle has been released by the French police. However, after serious negotiations by Secretary Wang of our camp, the Japanese consul personally signed his name to be responsible and agreed to be summoned at any time. The French police agreed to return the vehicle to the Japanese consul. Because this involves international negotiations, we are sending this letter to request that you promptly send personnel to conduct serious negotiations on compensation for the family and burial of the deceased, and must be generous to appease the wronged soul." After receiving the letter, the municipal government immediately checked and rescinded the post-disaster arrangements of the Negotiation Office, and in order to avoid all formalities, it appointed Wu Guozhen, the director of the Finance Bureau, as its representative to negotiate with the Japanese consulate. The Japanese Consul Tanaka received Representative Wu, who presented three demands to the Japanese Consul: (1) The Japanese military attaché should formally apologize to our authorities; (2) The deceased should be compensated generously; (3) The culprit should be severely punished. The Japanese Consul expressed acceptance and sent the naval attaché and army attaché to the camp to apologize to Director He. The amount of compensation was discussed several times without reaching an agreement. Later, Mayor Liu sent Li Boren, the director of the Health Bureau, to contact the Japanese Consul again. It was decided that the Japanese side would compensate 500 yuan and punish the culprit to close the case. Mayor Liu immediately reported the solution to Director He of the camp and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting instructions. Director He immediately expressed his agreement, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent two replies, one stating: "Now that your office has negotiated this case, the Japanese naval attaché has apologized to me and admitted to compensation. Please continue to negotiate on the spot to resolve it." The second stated: "The death of Yang Ruiwen in this car accident was indeed caused by the driver's negligence, but if Director He considers the various terms agreed to by the Japanese side to be feasible, please settle it accordingly." After receiving the replies from the camp and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the municipal government sent a letter to the Japanese Consul stating: "Regarding the case of the vehicle of your country's navy crushing Yang Ruiwen on June 10th in the local French Concession, the consul has agreed to provide a compensation fee of 500 silver dollars in addition to the clothing and coffin expenses, which shows great consideration for diplomatic relations and compassion for the deceased. Director Li Boren has been sent to your office to represent everything, and we hope you will accept and handle it." The Japanese side also replied in writing, and Japanese Consul Tanaka escorted Representative Li back to the municipal government with 500 yuan in cash and clothing and coffin expenses. The letter stated: "Regarding the case of the vehicle used by the local Japanese naval soldiers colliding with the bicycle ridden by Yang Ruiwen, a soldier of the camp, on June 10th, in the local French Concession, causing Yang Ruiwen's death, we offer our condolences to the deceased and the naval side will provide the bereaved family with a compensation fee of 500 yuan to resolve this case. This consul-general has previously discussed this matter with your mayor's representative, Director Li, and we have reached an agreement. We have received your government's letter No. 1657 dated the 24th of this month stating that your mayor has also agreed, etc. We are now sending 500 silver dollars and hope that you will check and forward them. Now that this case has been resolved, neither party will raise any demands on this matter in the future, whether public or private." After receiving the letter, the municipal government deposited the compensation with the camp for verification and transfer, and reported it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for record (June 27).</p>

<h3 id="e9">Guangdong Merchants Organize Fuguo Company <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Mining Coal in Jiang District, Northeast</p>
<p>The Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce, in conjunction with the Coal Industry and Silk Industry Research Society and overseas Chinese, has organized a coal mining company named Fuguo Company to mine the Jiang mining area in the Northeast. This is an innovative move in establishing industries, and it is very important for counteracting foreign coal, providing for daily use, and employing workers. According to responsible officials of the company, the mining areas in Qujiang County, including Xishui, Simaoping, Matiwo, Laohuchong, Dalingdongshui, and the mining areas in Lechang County, including Yangxi, Chulingjiao, Jigongshan, and Tuzhuling, have been repeatedly surveyed and tested by the famous coal mining engineer Rong Jintong. Hong Kong government chemist Du Wei analyzed the coal quality in March of this year and found it to be high-quality white coal. Furthermore, British mining engineer McJoe surveyed the area several years ago and stated that the area has abundant mineral resources. Based on the Xiangri Xiexing Coal Mine (located in front of the company's mining site in Matiwo), which produces 15,000 tons per month, the reserves are sufficient for more than fifty years of mining. The mining sites now developed by our company have ten times the output of that mine. Furthermore, in February of this year, the Construction Department sent personnel to conduct a joint survey with the county and approved the mining. It has been found that the above-mentioned coal mines mostly produce smokeless white coal, suitable for machinery factories and cooking fuel, similar to the mines in Hongji, French Indochina, and superior to the mixed coal from Tokyo and Haiphong. According to recent surveys, the annual consumption of this white coal is approximately 100,000 tons in Guangzhou, approximately 500,000 to 600,000 tons in Shanghai, approximately 100,000 tons in Shantou and Xiamen, approximately 200,000 tons in Hong Kong, and approximately 600,000 to 700,000 tons in Japan, totaling over 1.8 million tons. Although Henan Province's Fu'an Company produces white coal, it is far from the south and difficult to supply. It is regrettable that the huge demand is monopolized by French Indochina's Hongji white coal and Quji, Maoji, Jibu, Dongxiang, and other mixed coals. It is also regrettable that the same white coal is produced everywhere in the Beijiang area of Guangdong, but due to various difficulties, the goods are abandoned on the ground. The purpose of our company's initiation of mining is not only to meet the needs of industry and civilian use in the province but also to focus on developing foreign trade, transporting and selling to other provinces and foreign countries, so as to resist foreign goods and promote domestic products. It is estimated that the mining areas have been submitted for opening, and there is also oil coal sufficient for long-term use by ships, trains, electrical machinery plants, silk factories, etc. The function of white coal briquettes and oil coal is equivalent, and it can also be made into smokeless coal briquettes to replace firewood and solid carbon, which is truly beneficial to the national economy and the daily life of the people. The concern is that the history of mining in Guangdong has been repeated. If no measures are taken to remedy the causes of failure, then the act of benefiting the country and the people is simply empty talk. Beijiang and Guangzhou are neighboring lands, arriving in the evening after a morning departure, but the calculated cost of mining is not as good as the cheap price of foreign coal brought in by sea, with heavy taxes and odd transportation fees. Both are fatal injuries to the operation of domestic coal. With heavy costs, transportation is naturally slow. No one in this province pays attention to it, let alone shipping it overseas. As a result, they can only wait to die and let foreign coal be imported. Our company has requested the General Chamber of Commerce to list the minimum requirements, one of which falls within the scope of the Ministry of Finance: (A) In addition to paying land tax for the mining area and wellhead tax for mineral products, our company's coal will be exempt from all taxes and levies at checkpoints when transported for sale in the province, and all counties will be ordered to strictly prohibit additional levies under the guise of local public welfare and police expenses. (B) The Fushun Coal Mine only pays an export tax of one penny for transporting coal, and all other import taxes and levies are waived. Coal mines opened in Qingdao and other places pay only one penny for export tax and half tax of five cents at the port of entry, and no other taxes are levied. The purpose of our company's coal mining is to compete with foreign coal, not only to stop the leak but also to vigorously promote it abroad, and it is not enough to seriously reduce costs to compete with imported coal. It is proposed to give special preferential treatment and follow the example of the Fushun Coal Mine. In addition to paying the regular tax of one penny, all sales to other provinces will no longer be taxed. The second falls within the scope of the Ministry of Railways: The government has many precedents for reducing transportation costs to maintain domestic products. The Shandong Zhongxing Coal Mining Company's railway coal transportation is charged by the railway bureau with the highest rate of seven cents of ocean per ton per kilometer and the lowest rate of five cents and five mills of ocean per ton per kilometer. Within 240 kilometers, it is set at six cents and five mills per ton per kilometer. The length of the route is similar to that from Guangzhou to Shaoguan. Our company follows the precedent and proposes to stipulate that the freight rate be six cents and five mills of ocean per ton per kilometer, and the railway bureau will provide transportation vehicles. If our company provides vehicles, then the freight rate will be calculated at five cents and five mills per ton per kilometer, and the Yuehan Railway Administration will be ordered to handle it according to the proposed freight rate. The third falls within the scope of both the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining and the Ministry of Railways: Please exempt all domestic Taiping San Pass, Huangsha Li Factory, etc. from levying tariffs in addition to paying customs duties on our company's mining and transportation machinery, rails, carts, locomotives, and other mining and transportation equipment. As for railway freight, please also follow the precedent of the Zhongxing mining area and reduce it by half. The fourth falls within the scope of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining: Please follow the Shandong Zhongxing Coal Mine's articles of association, which stipulate that traditional methods of mining are not allowed within ten miles and that no company using the same machinery is allowed within one hundred miles, so as to avoid disputes between each other during mining. The above-mentioned items are purely for the purpose of resisting foreign coal invasion and encouraging the promotion of domestic coal at home and abroad, and for the sake of developing industry and maintaining civilian use, there is nothing more urgent than this.</p>
<h3 id="e10">New Survey of Tusi and Tuguan in Sichuan <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The positions have historically been hereditary, only with the Ministry adding appointments to show restraint.</p>
<p>Internally, everything will be planned to be merged with the current system.</p>
<p>Sichuan Province has recently implemented the abolition of Daos and reorganized county governments. In addition to the original 146 counties, two new counties, Baoxing and Ningnan, have been added. The three Tuns of Chonghua, Fubian, and Suijing in western Sichuan are now directly under the jurisdiction of the provincial government and are still waiting for discussion on reorganization and merger. The titles of Tusi and Tuguan under the jurisdiction of the various border counties are numerous and will also be comprehensively planned and merged separately to conform to the current system. According to the survey by the provincial government, the names of the various Tusi, Tuguan, and Tuzu are very detailed and are disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>Pingwu County, Western Fan and Tuban, established one Tusi Tongpan, one Tusi Changguansi, and one Tusi Zhishi.</p>
<p>Mao County, Qiang ethnic group, established three Changguansi, two Xunjiansi, and one Anfusi.</p>
<p>Wenchuan, Tanggute ethnic group, established one Wasi Tusi and one Xuanweishi Si.</p>
<p>Songpan County, Man, Rong, Qiang, and Guo ethnic groups, established one Changguansi and one Minzhengsi, thirteen Tusi Shoubei, eight Tusi Qianzong, and each one Tusi Bazong Waiwei.</p>
<p>Lifan County, Tuban, established four Tusi, three Changguansi, and one Xuanweishi.</p>
<p>Maogong County, Yi ethnic group, established two Tusi, ten Datouren, and ten Xiaotouren.</p>
<p>Xichang County, Guo Luo, established five Changguansi, nine Qianhu, and twelve Baihu.</p>
<p>Mianning County, Western Fan and Guo Luo, established one Tusi and seven Baihu. Zhaojue County, Yi ethnic group, established one Xuanfusi and eleven Tusi Mu. Yuejun County, Guo Luo and Western Fan, established one Xuanfusi and one Tusi Dusi, and two Tusi Guan.</p>
<p>Yanbian County, Miao, Fan, and Guo Luo, established one Bingmasi and one Changguansi, two Tusi Qianhu, and twenty Datou.</p>
<p>Tianquan County, Tusi Fan, established one Xuanweishi Si.</p>
<p>Ebian County, Guo Luo and Yi ethnic groups, established five Tusi Qianhu and three Tusi Mu, and seventeen Tusi Baihu.</p>
<p>Yanyuan County, Western Fan and Zhou Yi, established two Anfusi and one Bingmasi, three Tusi Qianhu, twenty Tusi Ba Si, six Tusi Baihu, and nine Tusi Mu.</p>
<p>Huili County, Black and White Yi, established three Tusi, six Tusi Qianhu, and nine Baihu.</p>
<p>Mabian County, Black and White Guo Yi, established one Tusi Qianhu, one Tusi Mu, and one Qiuzhang each.</p>
<p>Leibo County, Black and White Yi, established one Changguansi, thirteen Tusi Qianhu, and forty-two Tusi Baihu.</p>
<p>Gulan County, Guo Luo and Miao Yi, established eight Tusi Mu.</p>
<p>Qijiang County, Luo Na and Qinghong Miao ethnic groups, established three Tusi Mu.</p>
<p>Nanchuan County, Miao ethnic group, established one Tusi Mu.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned positions of Tusi and Tuguan have historically been hereditary, with the Ministry adding appointment certificates to show restraint. Because they do not conform to the new system, the Ministry of Interior has requested the Sichuan Provincial Government to temporarily add appointments and separately formulate unified measures for submission to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Hangzhou Quick News <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>This morning at four o'clock, a fire broke out at the Wang Rixing chopstick shop at the entrance of Dajing Lane, spreading to more than twenty houses, burning to death four men and women.</p>
<p>In order to unify the organization of all merchants in Zhejiang Province, the Provincial Training Department plans to send Xu Da and thirteen others to Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Wenzhou, Taizhou, Quzhou, and Yan'an to guide the reorganization of various merchant groups according to law.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou City Merchant Organization Unification Committee held a general membership registration, scheduled to begin on July 1. Yesterday, the general registration method was submitted to the Municipal Government for verification.</p>
<p>The price of rice at the Hushen rice market has soared in the past week, increasing by two yuan per picul. Saigon rice has also risen accordingly. However, it was decided during the last price increase for retail rice that prices would not be discussed until July 10, so the original price is temporarily maintained. However, due to excessive losses, the rice color of each vendor has changed, and the price of 14 yuan per picul has no goods available.</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<p>Jiading</p>
<p>The long-distance telephone will soon be completed. The County Construction Bureau handled the long-distance telephone project, which was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of June. The lines in the western townships have already been installed. However, in Fangtai and Huangdu, disputes arose over the location of the generator installation, so the lines have not been installed and communication is not possible. All lines in the southern townships have been connected, except for the section between Nanxiang and Jiwang, where the installation of underwater cables has not been completed due to obstacles caused by ships traveling in the Wusong River. The Jia-Cao line and Jia-Guang line in the eastern townships have already been installed. Generators have been installed in Xuhang, Caowang, Chengqiao, Jianbang, Guangfu, and other places. Communication was established yesterday.</p>
<p>Robbery in Three Small Villages: The residents of the Three Small Villages west of Nanxiang Town consist of only four or five households. The family of a certain surname is quite wealthy. At about 9 p.m. on the 25th, a bandit ship suddenly arrived and anchored near the village. More than twenty bandits, speaking the Jiangbei dialect, with towels wrapped around their heads and carrying iron rulers and bayonets, broke into houses and robbed them for more than an hour before leaving. They robbed more than four hundred and fifty silver dollars, sixty thousand copper coins, more than ten piculs of white rice, and clothes, etc., worth about six to seven hundred yuan, totaling a loss of more than one thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Innocent Merchants and Citizens Detained: Zhou Yinlin, who runs a teahouse in Zhangpu Town, was suddenly arrested yesterday by Wen, the Inspector of the County Public Security Bureau, along with a dozen members of the debt-collecting team armed with guns. Without asking for any explanation, Zhou was arrested and taken to the bureau. It was later learned that the reason for the arrest was that someone had anonymously reported that Zhou was involved in collusion with bandits. After interrogation, there was no evidence, and it was found that he had been falsely accused. He was released on bail. A piece of anonymous letter has caused such an ordeal, truly an injustice.</p>
<p>The Director of the Construction Bureau is Accused: Wu Junyu, the Director of the Construction Bureau of this county, has been in Kunshan for two years and has made no achievements in various construction projects. The construction of the Kun-Tai Road has been suspended for half a year, and there has been no report on income and expenditure, causing dissatisfaction among all circles. It is now heard that the County Party Affairs Consolidation Committee has requested the Provincial Government to order the Construction Department to send personnel to thoroughly investigate. Songjiang</p>
<p>Three Bandits Executed by Firing Squad: Pan Jingqing, the local security officer of Xiaozheng, was evil and tyrannical, recruiting bandits and engaging in robbery and looting. He secretly sat and divided the spoils, committing crimes in Qingpu within this territory. After the incident, he was arrested, and accomplices Wang Jingqin and Liu Xiaomei were also captured. After interrogation, their crimes were confirmed, and they were sentenced to death according to law. The Provincial Government approved the execution by telegram. Upon receiving the telegram, the County Government dispatched police to bring Pan, Wang, and Liu to justice, verified their identities, and took them to the Yuhuang Pavilion execution ground to be executed by firing squad.</p>
<p>Cooperative Movement and Pest Control Measures: Yesterday, the County Government convened a meeting of representatives from various agencies to prepare for the cooperative movement and pest control movement. Ge Hongye from the Provincial Insect Bureau attended the meeting. County Magistrate Jin, as the chairman, reported the provincial order that the cooperative movement should be held starting from the first Saturday of July this year (World Cooperative Day). He also reported the order from the Agricultural Department that the Provincial Insect Bureau had submitted a plan for the first pest control propaganda campaign in the province. After deliberation by the Provincial Government, it was ordered to hold county propaganda meetings and township patrols from July 3 to July 17. The result of the discussion was to combine the preparations for the two movements and hold them separately, using the Public Library as the venue. The publicity fee for the cooperative movement was set at sixty yuan, and the County Party Department, Farmers Bank, and People's Education Center were designated to preside over the cooperative movement. The Education Bureau, County Farm, Agricultural Education Center, and Provincial Suili Experimental Farm were designated to preside over the pest control section, and the general affairs and propaganda sections were separately prepared.</p>
<p>Summary of the Meeting of Village Chiefs: The County Government convened a meeting of village chiefs from various districts under the county on the 28th. County Magistrate Jin, as the chairman, reported on important cases and then resolved that the county's previous administrative meeting had decided to start a household registration donation to supplement the police recruitment. The Provincial Government approved the change of the name of the household registration donation to defense donation, and the method of donating money according to the previous divisions was slightly changed to show consideration for the people's difficulties. A manual survey will be conducted by local people recommended by the district chiefs and hired by the county to assist the district chiefs in the survey to facilitate the handling. The provincial order that officials and autonomous staff must take an oath must be reported before July 15 for compilation. Some district chiefs proposed to prohibit fish nests and crab trapping, and it was resolved that the county would issue a notice to prohibit it. After the discussion, the administrative expenses for each district were issued, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>The First District Office Prepares for Price Stabilization: As the period for price stabilization is approaching, the First District Office convened a price stabilization meeting yesterday and decided to purchase No. 2 Xian tribute rice. The Rice Industry Association was entrusted to order it and transport 1,000 bags to Songjiang before July 15, and the rest will be transported to Songjiang in batches. The boundaries of each branch office will be divided to avoid confusion. After the rice arrives, the branches will take the receipts to the district office to collect it. The expenses for each branch office will be submitted to the county government for approval, as the first district has no surplus funds.</p>
<p>Fengxian</p>
<p>Relief Measures After the Hail Disaster: Since this county suffered a hail and drought disaster, the County Government immediately convened a local meeting to discuss relief and has already decided on ten measures, the most important of which are: (1) Order the district offices in the disaster-stricken areas to accurately register the number of damaged fields and the names of the deceased. (2) Landlords should lend seven corners of planting capital per picul to tenants so that they can purchase seeds and replant. Families with less than fifteen mu of self-cultivated land and the poor should have their district offices borrow seeds from shops and repay them after the autumn harvest. (3) Issue a notice to all land and rice shops that they must not raise the price of seeds, and those who violate this will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Cleaning Up Arrears in Land Tax: Hong, the former county magistrate, convened a committee of various agencies to clean up arrears in land tax, but it was suspended halfway, so it did not proceed. Now, County Magistrate Shen Qingchen believes that the amount of arrears in land tax is huge, which not only affects the tax revenue of the national and provincial treasuries, but also greatly affects local undertakings that should respond to the surtax. Therefore, he advocates thorough cleanup and has reorganized the committee and hired a certain Zhang as the person in charge, limited to two months to make a roster and investigate.</p>
<p>The Kidnapping of the Lu Family Has Not Yet Been Resolved: In Fang Sixteen Tu near Zhuanghang, a nine-year-old child from the wealthy Lu family was kidnapped. After receiving a letter from the bandits demanding a ransom of 20,000 yuan, the mother went to a certain place on the agreed date to prepare to negotiate, but no one came after waiting all day. At the same time, Ding Zhiyan, the captain of the police team in this county, heard about this situation and sent squad leader Yang Xingsheng to track it down for strict investigation. According to the report, the victim is still in the countryside, and he has joined forces with Wang Jinchuan, the captain of the water police team, to search in separate directions in order to arrest the bandits. Although the Lu family is nominally said to have three families combined, the family property is less than one hundred mu, and it has long been exhausted after two robberies. The mother cannot cope with it and has repeatedly wanted to commit suicide. The misery of the bandits is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>The Silk Industry Association Scheduled a Meeting: Since the beginning of summer, the weather in this county has been abnormal, resulting in the death of many summer silkworms in the four townships. It is said that only two or three out of ten silkworms survived compared to previous years, which is a great misfortune for farmers. It is now heard that Hua Shaochun and others, the executive members of the Silk Industry Association, have decided to convene a meeting of all committee members at 2 p.m. on July 1 to discuss the opening date of the market and the price of fresh silkworms, as the summer silkworms are about to be placed on the cocooning frame.</p>
<p>The Labor-Capital Problem in Silk Factories Has Not Been Resolved: The Labor Union of Silk Factory Workers in this county previously proposed twenty-four labor-capital conditions, which were approved and signed by the Silk Factory Industry Association. Unexpectedly, the capital suddenly repented at the expiration date, which caused disputes. It is learned that only a few factory owners opposed this matter, resulting in internal inconsistency. Yesterday afternoon, the Labor Union held its 34th committee meeting and resolved the following matters: (1) Adopt a calm attitude and urge the Party and government agencies to resolve the matter fairly as soon as possible. (2) Draft and print a declaration for distribution. (3) Order all members to abide by the association's discipline and wait for a resolution, and not to take any out-of-line actions, and instruct the sub-labor unions to comply and be responsible for conveying the instructions to all members. After the meeting, the executive committee members Tao Shensheng, Hua Nianzhu, Ye Qiaoyun, etc., went to the county government to meet with County Magistrate Sun to ask for instructions. County Magistrate Sun expressed that he would be responsible for convening a meeting of both labor and capital to mediate within a short period of time. Tao and others were satisfied and left.</p>
<p>Military Police Salary Stolen: Wang Longdao, the company commander of the Eighth Company of the First Regiment of Military Police stationed in Chengjiang, came to Wuxi a few days ago to receive more than 1,300 yuan from the regimental headquarters and placed it in a handbag. That night, he took the Cheng-Xi ferry back to Chengjiang. When he arrived, it was after 10 p.m. Wang walked back to the camp alone, carrying the handbag and a flashlight. When he passed through the dark area near the Wenchang Temple Stone Horse Lane outside the East Gate of Chengjiang, three people wearing black clothes suddenly came forward to rob him. Wang was pushed into a rice field by the roadside, and the salary and official documents in the handbag were taken away. When he climbed out of the rice field, the bandits were long gone. He immediately rushed to the Longgang company headquarters and sent a team to search everywhere, and reported to the county government and the regimental headquarters in Wuxi to request a joint search.</p>
<p>Sun Junxi was Escorted Back to Wuxi: Sun Junxi, the former Minister of Propaganda of the County Party Department, was arrested for gambling and suspected of counter-revolutionary activities and sent to Suzhou for trial by the High Court. The counter-revolutionary part was sentenced to six months in prison, which has now expired. However, the case of Tan Qixuan, the director of the Beishang Township Administration Bureau in Wuxi, who was killed, is still under investigation. Tan Zhongying, the father of the deceased, has accused Sun and Lu Wugao, who is in custody, in the county. Therefore, the County Government yesterday specially sent political police Liu Yirong and Wu Rongsheng to Suzhou with documents to escort Sun back. Tang Yiqin, a member of the backlog clearance case, opened a court for trial. Sun confessed that Lu Shigao shot and killed Tan Qixuan, and that he had reported the case, so Lu framed him out of hatred. Tang interrogated him briefly and ordered him to be sent to the detention center for custody, pending the trial of Lu Shigao for verification.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>News After the Counter-Revolutionary Suspect was Sent to Beijing: The military police stationed in Changzhou previously found anti-revolutionary language in the diary of Xiong Jihuan, the deputy head of Bajiao Township, in the Jiqing Hotel. The witnesses were also taken to the company headquarters and transferred to the regimental headquarters of the First Regiment in the capital for interrogation. Xiong Jihuan confessed that the anti-revolutionary words were framed by He Wenquan and Wu Jinkun, who had a feud with him. According to the confession, the regimental headquarters sent a team to Changzhou to join the Benniu Public Security Second Branch to arrest He and Wu and send them to Beijing for interrogation with Xiong. Yesterday, the district chief Song Zhen requested the county government to release He and others, stating that He and others had been acting properly and serving as primary school teachers with enthusiasm for school affairs. District Chief Song then submitted a document to the county for verification.</p>

<p>The Huaiyin Party Rectification Committee Came to the Province to Petition: Li Keyi and others, members of the Huaiyin County Party Rectification Committee, previously accused Xu Jiaqing, the county magistrate of the county, of being昏庸and derelict in his duties, and of縱匪殃民. They were once responsible for reporting it. Now, because the county magistrate disregarded public opinion and blindly protected the director of the Education Bureau, they specially presented the Provincial Party Rectification Committee and the Education Department, requesting that he not be appointed. Various agencies and groups also jointly presented the Provincial Government, firmly opposing the county magistrate's protection of unworthy people. The county magistrate was therefore resentful and suddenly sent many police officers to surround the Party Department on the night of the other day and arrest the affairs secretary Zhou Xuanzi and imprison him. The members of the County Party Rectification Committee, Li Keyi, Yuan Qiyu, Hu Yiyun, and Shi Dongshan, secretly came to Zhenjiang and reported to the Provincial Party Rectification Committee, requesting that the Provincial Government be consulted to replace the county magistrate.</p>

<p>A 108-Year-Old Man Came to Zhenjiang: Li Shangyi, a 108-year-old man, a native of Henan, came to Zhenjiang on his way from Shanghai to visit places in passing, believing in Islam. Before the age of seventy-five, Mr. Li had visited Zhenjiang before. The local Islamic followers in Zhenjiang believe that the old man is strong and healthy, a blessing among people, and has a strong faith in Islam. Therefore, after he checked in, many men and women came to visit him. It is heard that Mr. Li plans to visit various agencies and scenic spots. Inspection of Stamps Caused Disputes: The Money Industry Association has recently received letters from various money houses stating that inspectors from the Stamp Tax Bureau inspect stamps and go to various houses to search in groups of three to five without the company of gang police, harassing them at will. If there is no missing stamp, they forcibly sell stamps, up to several hundred yuan. If their wishes are not fulfilled, they take the opportunity to search, turning over boxes and cabinets, and nitpicking. The money houses have a large turnover of silver dollars every day. For safety, they would rather stop business than allow them to trample and suffer unexpected losses. Jiangsu Province's Disaster Relief Progress: The Jiangsu Province Disaster Relief Association held its eleventh meeting at the Civil Affairs Department at 4 p.m. yesterday.

Tang confessed that he was thirty-five years old, a native of Haizhou, and that he had found the residence through Liu Bingsheng on the 2nd of this month. He had committed many crimes in Shuyang when he was young, but had never been caught. He said that his arrest this time was perhaps due to the will of heaven. According to Liu Bingsheng, he knew Tang in prison before, and he helped him find a house because Tang entrusted him to do so. The address of No. 40 Wuliuqiao is true. After the confession, Zhu regarded the case as a bandit case and sent Tang and Liu to the county government on the morning of the 24th.</p>

Unexpectedly, seven bandits suddenly came at about 3 p.m. the other day, each holding guns, and rushed into the house, overturning boxes and cabinets. They only found more than one hundred silver dollars. The bandits were still not satisfied and demanded a huge sum of money from Guo, but failed. They then dispersed to the four corners of the house and set it on fire. In an instant, the fire was raging, burning dozens of tiled houses, thousands of bags of flour, and hundreds of vats of bean oil, with losses of about tens of thousands of yuan. Guo has now gone to the county to report the case.</p>

The security forces surrounded and intercepted them. Knowing that there were preparations, the bandits immediately retreated.</p>
<p>Opium Traffickers Are Active Again: The voices of official investigations against opium traffickers in Tongyi have recently subsided, and they are now active again. The Yaogang Poyang ship unloaded a large amount of opium pills upon arrival in the port. It is heard that a protection fee of three yuan per package is paid, causing a public outcry. The Phoenix Bridge Bandits' Riot: On the morning of the 27th, three hundred bandits from Haimen County rioted in the Phoenix Bridge area in the east of Nantong.

Wang joined the robbery cases in Yaqian and Xincang last winter and this spring. Recently, seeing that the provincial defense forces were strictly arresting bandits in the eastern townships, he fled to Zhapu on the other day and temporarily lived in Jiang Along's house in Beimen as a farmhand. On the afternoon of the 25th, Shen Asi, a temporary detective of the County Government's patrol team, learned about it and immediately telegraphed Captain Yang. Captain Yang telegraphed Duonmu, the branch director of the Zhapu Public Security Bureau, asking him to send police to assist in the arrest. After receiving the telegram, Director Duonmu ordered Patrol Chief Wang to lead three police officers and assist Shen Asi to go to the scene and arrest Monk Wang on the spot. On the 26th, he was escorted from Zhapu to Pinghu. Yang Zhuoqing, the captain of the patrol team, conducted a preliminary interrogation. According to Wang Hesheng, he admitted to robbing Xincang with a knife this spring. After the confession, Captain Yang immediately prepared to send him to the county government for handling according to law.</p>
<p>Ningbo</p>
<p>Summary of Banditry: Zhou, a resident of Zhou Village in Changshou District, Fenghua, was not wealthy, but he was also coveted by bandits. On the night of the 24th, six bandits suddenly came with wooden shell guns and flashlights, broke into the house, and tied up Zhou's son, demanding a ransom of 3,000 yuan. The family is now having difficulty raising the money and is very anxious. Also, the home of Wu Jialin, the village chief of Liu Fu Village, was entered by five bandits at about 9 p.m. the other night, asking Wu for 500 yuan in travel expenses. As a result, they extorted 40 silver dollars. Also, the Sanchakou Village in Shuanghui Township, Yuyao, is located in a remote mountain area, and the bandit forces are rampant, coming and going without avoiding anyone. At 7 p.m. on the 24th, more than ten bandits wearing blue cloth short clothes were found again. Five of them were buying snacks at the Wannian Tea Pavilion, three were hiding under the tree shed, and three were detouring in the village. Wei, a villager, saw that their behavior was suspicious and immediately notified the villagers to hold weapons for defense. Fortunately, they were not robbed.</p>
<p>Yin-Feng Highway Collects and Transports Mail: Since the opening of the Yin-Feng Automobile Road of the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau, business has been quite prosperous. Now, in order to develop its business, it has contacted the post office to collect and transport Yin-Feng mail. Yin-Feng mail used to be delivered by small boats and had to arrive the next day, which was very inconvenient. Since the change to using cars to transport it on the 9th of this month, it can be reached on the same day. The bridge can send mail to Yong with 1 hour, which is faster. Since the implementation of this method, both the road bureau and the post office have been able to increase their income, and the people feel more convenient. However, heavy mail (i.e., newspapers, packages, etc.) is still delivered by small boats.</p>
<p>Shaoxing</p>
<p>Price Stabilization Implemented: The Shaoxing Food Maintenance Association will handle the price stabilization of 13,000 bags of rice, which have now been loaded and transported to Shaoxing. It is scheduled to open at 14 yuan per picul. Because it is necessary to consume 50,000 yuan according to cost calculation, it has been sent to the county and reported to the province for record, and the loss will be withdrawn from the reserve donation.</p>
<p>Cooperative Movement Propaganda: All party and government agencies in Shaoxing were ordered to organize a preparatory committee for the cooperative movement propaganda week. The first meeting was held at the county department on the 27th, and Chairman Zhang Jixiao decided to hold the opening ceremony on July 5. Representatives of the county party department, the Construction Bureau, and the county chamber of commerce were appointed as standing committee members. The Chamber of Commerce refused to take on the general affairs section, so the county party department took on the editing section and the Construction Bureau took on the guidance section. On July 1, a representative conference of various agencies and groups will be convened to discuss the progress of the matter. Tragedy of Broken Power Pole: Since the installation of the new machine, the Daming Electric Light Company has been replacing the power poles along the street these days. At about 4 p.m. yesterday, while working on Huajiao, the power pole suddenly broke due to years of decay, pulling down several poles. Two mechanics fell down and injured a child selling peaches there. Except for one person who was slightly injured, the other two were bleeding profusely and unconscious. They were immediately taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan</p>
<p>The County Court President Will Be Sworn In Regularly: Since the establishment of the Xiaoshan County Court, the High Court and the High Prosecutor's Office have separately appointed Yang Ti as the president and Yang Ti as the chief prosecutor. It has been nearly October and they have not yet been sworn in. It is now learned that President Yang and others are scheduled to hold a swearing-in ceremony in the hall of the hospital at 10 a.m. on July 3, and various agencies have been invited to attend.</p>
<p>Bombs Exploded and Were Seized and Sent to the County: On the 24th, in Xiaoshan Dongxiang Xiaosihuan, three soldiers in military uniforms, Liu Guozhen, Liu Pengfei, and Wang Agou, were carrying three bombs on the road. Suddenly, the bombs exploded, injuring one pedestrian and killing one. The local public security sub-bureau took Liu and the other three and the remaining two bombs to the bureau for interrogation. They were evasive and their origins were unknown. The bureau chief led a team to escort Liu and others to the county government for verification.</p>
<p>Suining</p>
<p>Shijiadun Weizi Was Robbed Again: Since this spring, Wei San and Liu Rongduo, well-known bandits in Suining, have been rampant in the three counties of Suining, Suqian, and Si. In Suining County alone, there have been five or sixty cases of mining weizi walls being架. The number of households being taken is even more uncounted. Recently, the Shijiadun Weizi, more than ten li east of the county, was broken by the bandits led by Wei and Liu, and they occupied Zhang Weizi on the 22nd. The momentum was quite large, and the encirclement team did not dare to advance to suppress them. According to reports, the Weizi was attacked by Liu's bandits once before, and all the houses in the Weizi were burned down, and more than 800 people were killed. Afterwards, the Jiangsu Provincial Government provided disaster relief funds, and the Agricultural and Mining Department constructed new villages. Unexpectedly, the new villages are still under construction, and they have suffered another catastrophe. Twenty or forty residents were killed, and the houses in the Weizi were completely burned. The grains, grass, clothing, and belongings were all lost. All the wood purchased by the Agricultural and Mining Department for the construction of the new villages was also burned. All the weizi walls that have not been captured are now in danger.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3 id="e12">Letter from the Suqian County Public Security Bureau <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Respected Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the news reported in your newspaper on June 19 that the Suqian Public Security Bureau was accused, according to the investigation, the monk Xiangzhai Jisheng and others of Jile Temple Wu Hua Ding, Suqian, led the knife club to attack the city last year and have been publicly wanted and the temple property has been confiscated. Previously, according to the Provincial Committee, the county estimated the temple property and divided it into four shares for the temple and the remaining six shares for local public welfare. On the morning of the 8th, the county notified the monks of the temple to comply. Unexpectedly, the monk Xiangzhai felt angry and厭世at the sudden division of the fields passed down from his ancestor's cassock, and secretly swallowed a wooden fish. On the afternoon of that day, Chen Jianming, an inspector from the Civil Affairs Department, and Committee Member Wang from the County Party Department went to our bureau and ordered us to send police to arrest the monks Xiangzhai and Jisheng to the bureau. Inspector Chen interrogated them briefly and learned that Xiangzhai had swallowed gold, so he sent him to the hospital for treatment and sent Jisheng to the county for custody. (Xiangzhai Zhitun Jin was released on the 16th.) He was also sent to the county for custody. The monk did not understand the truth and sent a telegram without authorization to arrest and frighten him. The facts that monk Xiangzhai was forced to swallow gold and monk Jisheng was frightened and fainted are not true. Therefore, we specially write to request correction to avoid confusing the hearing. I am grateful. Suqian County Public Security Bureau, June 24.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Customs Duty on Ship Tonnage at Tianjin <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Must be pre-collected at Shanghai Customs</p>
<p>To be handled according to the Ministry of Finance's order</p>
<p>Since the National Government ordered the sealing of Tianjin Customs, the volume of goods transported from Shanghai to Tianjin has also slightly decreased. Yesterday, it was learned that Shanghai Customs received an order from the Ministry of Finance stating that the ship tonnage duties payable by ships importing into Tianjin Customs must also be prepaid at Shanghai Customs. Foreign merchant shipping companies, fearing that Tianjin Customs might still forcibly collect these tonnage duties, have been presenting requests to their consular corps for instructions on how to proceed. The consular corps stated that this case had already been telegraphed to their respective governments for instructions, and they were awaiting a response and would observe the situation for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Silver Market Gradually Improving <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Due to Foreign Banks Shipping Silver for Export</p>
<p>The price of silver in the local market has slightly improved recently, rising slightly compared to the lowest point. Yesterday, the lowest price for silver reached 576 taels. Although there is no hope of completely recovering silver prices at the moment, it may not continue to plummet. According to a survey in banking circles yesterday, one of the reasons is said to be that foreign banks have not been secretly shipping in much silver recently, and because foreign banks have too much silver in storage, the market price has fallen below that of foreign countries, so they are shipping large amounts of raw silver overseas to various countries to find ways to sell it. As a result, the storage amount is gradually decreasing, and the market price can be maintained in its original state.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>After Passing the Bidding Sale</p>
<p>Both Officials and Civilians Have Serious Concerns</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company has officially passed the proposal to sell the bid to the International Company and will soon implement the transfer in accordance with the regulations. Various groups and citizens in our country are extremely indignant upon hearing this. According to investigations yesterday, the Ministry of Communications and various public groups have long known that the concession authorities and the company have had this plan for a long time and have already determined the methods. Therefore, they already knew that it must be passed. However, only a few Chinese shareholders attended the meeting that day, and some Westerners also opposed this proposal, which shows the sentiment of the people. Therefore, the National Government has decided to go a step further and will formally lodge a strong protest with the consular corps in Shanghai through diplomatic channels, urging them to urge the Public Works Department authorities not to formally approve the sale in order to remedy the situation. The most relevant groups in the special district, such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Union, the Chinese Taxpayers Association, and the Users' Union, have joined forces and are gathering the strength of various groups to take the second step of resistance, urging the purchaser, International Company, to realize the situation and voluntarily give up the purchase. Otherwise, they will take passive resistance to protect sovereignty. They are currently in contact with each other and will express their views soon.</p>
<p>Chinese Users Issued a Declaration Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company Chinese Users' Union convened a meeting at 2 PM yesterday and resolved the following: (1) Issue a declaration to awaken all groups in the city to provide united assistance. (2) Telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications to file a strong protest and declare that the International Telegraph and Telephone Company has no right to operate telephone services in Chinese territory. (3) Warn the International Telegraph and Telephone Company that all Chinese users cannot violate national laws and cooperate with the company before formally obtaining an exclusive franchise from the Chinese government. (4) Telegraph the American Minister to China, Johnson, to protest, and telegraph our Minister to the United States, Wu Chaoshu, to appeal to the US government to protest. The telegram stated that the International Telegraph and Telephone Company has not obtained an exclusive franchise in China. The meeting adjourned after the resolution. The declaration is recorded below:</p>
<p>Our country's telegraph and telephone industry is state-owned, as determined by Article 2 of the Telecommunications Regulations promulgated by the government on April 18, 1915. Private telephone services are not allowed to operate in a certain area without government permission. Article 3 of the same regulations also has clear provisions. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the state ownership of telegraphs and telephones has not changed, and private telephone services still need to be approved by the government. The approval of this private telephone service is not unique to our country; all countries in the world are the same. Therefore, those who operate telephone services in our country's territory should respect and abide by our country's laws and sovereignty. Previously, the Ministry of Communications believed that the telephone services operated by the Shanghai Telephone Company were not effective enough, and it was planned to recover the business by the Ministry at a price or approve private operation in order to improve the efficiency of public utilities. However, the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company did not pay attention to the above points and openly held a meeting and decided to sell the business to the International Telegraph and Telephone Company when the Chinese shareholders generally did not attend. The International Telegraph and Telephone Company also did not pay attention to the above points and rashly bid to buy this act that disregards our country's laws and sovereignty, which cannot be tolerated by any people or any country, and is especially heartbreaking for all our users. Now all our users have made up their minds, in addition to requesting the government to lodge a protest and declare that the telephone services operated by the International Telegraph and Telephone Company violate our country's laws and have not been approved by the government, we should take effective measures to stop its illegal business and absolutely prepare not to use illegal telephones and not to cooperate with the International Telegraph and Telephone Company. We will do what we say and will not regret our decision. We hope that all sectors will provide assistance to maintain national laws and sovereignty. This declaration is hereby issued for your consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Treacherous Merchants Manipulating the Rice Market <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Strictly Investigating Under Orders</p>
<p>Recently, the Municipal Government learned that treacherous merchants have been manipulating the rice market. In addition to issuing a strict ban, it instructed the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday: "According to reports, the price of rice in this city has risen continuously in recent days, with the highest price exceeding 20 yuan per stone. This is unprecedented. After investigation, the price increase is not due to a shortage of rice, but is caused by a small number of treacherous merchants manipulating the market for their own selfish gain, disregarding the people's food supply. This is a scourge of society and is extremely hateful. It is necessary to thoroughly investigate and severely punish them as a warning to others. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to issue a notice, you are hereby ordered to immediately conduct a thorough investigation and punish them without any consideration. Also, inform the Rice Price Evaluation Committee to actively proceed and report the handling situation at any time for inspection. This order is of utmost importance."</p>
<h3 id="e18">Future Rice Price Settlement <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs Scheduled a Meeting</p>
<p>The Municipal Grain Association has determined that there are many disputes over future rice contracts among merchants. It has been decided that the Westbound rice contracts purchased by merchants in May will be settled in order to resolve the issue. Rice contracts outside of Saigon will continue to be collected as usual. The document has been submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs for record. However, at the same time, the Rice Shop Industry Organization Rectification Committee believes that rice is related to the people's food supply and cannot be used for speculation like other commodities. Therefore, the settlement cannot be used as a solution, and once a bad example is set, it will cause endless troubles. A special document was submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs to stop this practice. It is reported that the Bureau of Social Affairs has scheduled a meeting of the two organizations for July 2 to discuss and resolve the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e19">New Method for Collecting Taxes at Tianjin Customs <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The Xinfeng Steamer Will Go to Tianjin on Tuesday</p>
<p>Regarding the suspension of customs inspection of imported goods at Tianjin Customs, the British and Japanese consuls in Shanghai have proposed discussions and plan to send personnel to Tianjin to negotiate a solution. Yesterday, the local Beiyang gang received a telegram from Tianjin stating that for goods shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin, if half of the Tianjin Customs duty has been paid in Shanghai, Tianjin Customs will still require the cargo owner to pay the duty upon arrival in Tianjin. However, in order to protect the interests of the cargo owner and avoid additional losses, Tianjin Customs has agreed to issue a tax receipt, and the cargo owner can hold this tax receipt to request a refund of the half-tax paid from Shanghai Customs. It would be best if the Jianghai Customs could refund the money. Otherwise, Tianjin Customs only needs to obtain proof that the cargo owner has indeed not recovered the half-tax paid, and it can use the receipt to collect the money in Tianjin.</p>
<p>However, regardless of whether the tax has been paid or not, it must be paid in full when the goods arrive in Tianjin.</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinfeng steamer returned to Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday and will still need to open to Tianjin on Tuesday, because there are still some goods in Shanghai that need to be trial-shipped to Tianjin to meet the needs.</p>

<p>The Business Reorganization Committee previously submitted four measures to relevant ministries for adoption in response to the dramatic increase in gold prices, which greatly affected the commercial and people's livelihoods. Yesterday, the committee received instructions from the Ministry of Finance stating that the measures presented were insightful and should be implemented selectively.

<p>At the recommendation of the Shanghai citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products, a general meeting of factory representatives was convened and a committee was elected to prepare for the event. The preparation period has now ended, and the group departed on the Dalian Maru at 9:00 AM yesterday. Around 8:00 AM, representatives from organizations such as the China National Products Maintenance Association, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the Commodity Exhibition Hall gathered at the Huangpu Wharf with flags and firecrackers to hold a farewell ceremony. Chairman Chen delivered a speech of thanks and shook hands in farewell. More than thirty factories participated in this event, such as China Enamel Factory, Wangxing Cotton and Iron Factory, Changxing Tobacco Factory, Shengde Weaving Factory, Dahua Silk Factory, Huayang Cloth Factory, Peide Tie Factory, Chunhua Silk Factory, Zhenhua Paint Factory, Huadong Weaving Factory, Guanshengyuan, Great China Celluloid Factory, Wuzhou Pharmacy, and Senyuanxiang Pearl and Diamond Factory, with about 1,000 boxes of various goods.

<h3 id="e24">After Public Evaluation <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Rice Shops Still Collect Commission</p>
<p>Yesterday, reporters from various newspapers saw a report stating that since the Bureau of Social Affairs held the North City rice boat registration and ordered the Rice Shop Association to evaluate the rice for sale, the North Zhabei rice shops had ceased operations because the rice was evaluated and sold directly by the association to the Jia Gengtang for distribution to various shops, without going through the rice shops. They asked a Mr. from the Bureau of Social Affairs about this matter. According to him, the boats arriving at the riverbanks in North City are sold to the evaluation office by the original merchants, and the Doumi Industry Association designates the rice shops in North City to evaluate the rice in turn and collect commissions as before, which are fairly distributed to all merchants in the same industry. The original interests of the rice shop merchants are not lost, but the operating method has changed from dispersion to concentration. This is a temporary management method during a rice shortage. Once the rice price falls back to a considerable level, it will be revoked. As for the saying that business is slack, it is naturally rare for boats to arrive during this time of the year when the old rice has been consumed and the new rice has not yet been harvested. This is probably just a small number.</p>
<p>The propaganda of a few people with ulterior motives is not credible. Mr. also stated that the local rice merchants have also suddenly realized that they will evaluate and sell the rice according to the evaluation and will no longer wait and see, hoping that all parties will work together to overcome this difficulty and wait for the new rice to be harvested. This is fortunate for the people of this city.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Jin Guobao's Talk After Returning Home <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Details of the Investigation in Japan</p>
<p>Population Survey of Six Major Cities</p>
<p>Uniformity of Municipal Finance</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Japan's National Transformation</p>
<p>Jin Guobao, the former Director of the Beijing Municipal Finance Bureau, was dispatched to Japan by the Municipal Government to investigate municipal finance. He has already returned to Beijing. Commissioner Jin is now organizing and researching what he learned in Japan, which will take about ten days to complete. He will then contribute it to the government for adoption as a reference for reforming our country's municipal finance. Yesterday, a reporter from the Daily News visited Mr. Jin at his private residence to ask about the results of his investigation. He told the reporter in great detail, and the following is a summary:</p>
<p>Population Survey: After I was dispatched to Japan to investigate municipal finance, I was warmly received by the municipal governments of various places. Since the earthquake in Japan, it has been striving to restore its construction business, which is beyond the reach of ordinary people. There are six major cities in the country: (1) Tokyo, (2) Osaka, (3) Kyoto (i.e., Xijing), (4) Kobe, (5) Nagoya, and (6) Yokohama. The government that manages municipal affairs in Japan is called the city office, which is directly under the prefecture government. This is the difference between it and our country's city status. However, the selection of the mayor is completely civilian and is not appointed by the government. The mayor is elected by all the citizens of the city. Therefore, the mayor's prestige and talent often surpass those of the prefectural governor, so the city's administrative scope is also quite broad. The estimated population of the six major cities recently is as follows: (1) Tokyo 2,218,400, (2) Osaka 2,333,800, (3) Nagoya 949,966, (4) Kyoto 736,000, (5) Kobe 717,771, and (6) Yokohama 565,308.</p>
<p>Financial Integrity</p>
<p>All regulations and procedures for local finance in Japan are uniform and centralized in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the central government. All municipal finance facilities follow the orders of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. For example, the creation of new taxes is not implemented without the approval of the central government. Therefore, all municipal finance revenues and expenditures are quite orderly. Regarding the construction part, a reconstruction bureau is attached to the Ministry of Internal Affairs after the earthquake. The reconstruction bureau and the city office are responsible for coordinating the size of the projects separately. However, the Japanese land tax still uses the land price of 30 to 40 years ago as the standard, which seems not very fair. When asked about it, the Japanese said that the Japanese government has been pursuing a tight fiscal policy in recent years, and it would cost a lot of money to conduct an investigation. Also, the Japanese government has been working hard to build since the earthquake. The current Tokyo has not only restored its former appearance, but has also become more beautiful, almost comparable to Washington and Paris. The most worthy of our reference in its restoration work is the issue of land zoning and reorganization. I will write another article to report to the people of the country.</p>
<p>Thoughts on this Trip: I am deeply impressed by the rapid development of the Japanese nation's undertakings on this trip. Our country has always criticized the Japanese for their short stature. In recent years, the Japanese government has been transforming the nation and promoting sports. Its speed of progress is enough to make people marvel. Older people may have short stature, but those under the age of 20 or 30 are tall and vigorous. Women also have large hands and feet, which are far beyond what Chinese women can hope to achieve. If our country does not promote sports and improve the race, then the outcome of international competition is a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>The Minhang Town Hexiangqiao area in the county suffered a sudden hailstorm on the 7th of this month, causing damage to farmland, and the disaster was immediately apparent. The first district reported the matter to the county government, which sent personnel to conduct an on-site inspection and report. It is now learned that the first district plans to submit a report to the county government on behalf of the Beiliu and other village chiefs, stating that the farmers have suffered this natural disaster and there is no hope for the autumn harvest. However, after checking, there are still many labor service taxes for the 18th year that have not been completed, and the farmers are really unable to pay them. They should be granted a delay in collection to alleviate the people's difficulties. Director Wu believes that this matter concerns the national tax, and yesterday he reported the situation to the county government for verification and compliance.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Current Affairs Rectification Committee held its 25th committee meeting yesterday afternoon. Chairman Jiang Wenbao performed the etiquette as usual and reported on the following matters: Matters for Discussion (1) How should the provincial rectification committee's circular on launching a campaign to promote domestic cigarettes be implemented? It was resolved to issue a circular to the district party departments and hand it over to the propaganda department. (2) The newspaper reported that Comrades Zhang Daoshen and Ye Xiufeng had resigned. Should this committee send a telegram to retain them? It was resolved to pass the resolution. (3) The National Labor University is the only school of our party that provides relief to students who cannot afford to continue their studies. It is inappropriate for the Ministry of Education to forcibly order the school to stop enrolling students. How should this be expressed? It was resolved to submit the matter to the province and then to the central government. (4) As summer is approaching</p>
<p>The committee's working hours should be revised. It was resolved that the working hours would be from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and the weekly holiday would be changed to Sunday. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Upper River Navigation News <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Wanliu steamer was rescued. The Wanliu steamer ran aground 45 li downstream of Chongqing, and the bottom of the ship was damaged. The passengers and cargo on board were rescued by the Nisshin Company's Yunyang Maru and Peiling Maru, which were passing by at the same time. Therefore, the passengers were safely rescued. On the 25th, the Taikoo Company's rescue steamer from Chongqing arrived at the scene. The Japanese steamer Yunyang and the steamer Fuling had already left the area and went to the port of Chongqing. The Wanliu steamer is still stranded, and the cargo on board is being unloaded.</p>
<p>Freight rates plummet. Since the resumption of navigation this year, the competition among Chinese and foreign merchant ships on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has been fierce. There are 11 Chinese companies, but foreign ships from Britain, Japan, and the United States are more numerous. Chinese ships account for only two-tenths of the total. Yichong has always had the highest freight rates in the country. This year, Chinese ships resumed six routes first, and foreign merchants drastically reduced freight rates as a countermeasure against monopolies. It is reported that foreign merchants from Britain and Japan are operating in Yichang and Chongqing at a loss to make it difficult for Chinese ships to survive. The Shanghai-Chongqing direct routes of American merchants have also changed to charging 37.5% of the set price to compete.</p>
<p>Huangzhou Traffic. A decade ago, foreign merchants' Yangtze River steamers temporarily stopped at Huangzhou, Huangshigang, and other ports, and requested the British Navy to protect the ships. Now that Huangzhou, Huangshigang, and other places have returned to normal, foreign steamers have resumed normal stops at Huangzhou and other places. However, the naval escort in the Wuhan-Xunyang section is still in effect.</p>
<p>Request for protection. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company of this port telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government and the Capital Garrison Headquarters yesterday, requesting special protection for the upstream and downstream navigation of all Yangtze River steamers so that national port navigation can be revitalized, and passengers and goods can be conveniently loaded and unloaded. Only in this way can the lost navigation rights be recovered and the Jiangjing steamer incident be prevented from happening again. This telegram was sent out yesterday.</p>
<p>Hunan goods are rushed for shipment. The Hunan passengers and goods stranded in Shanghai are now being urged to load by telegram from Changsha. The six companies in this port are loading ships for upstream.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Chamber of Commerce Protects Trademark for Domestically Produced Shirts and Socks <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Trademark Bureau to protect the "Lion Ball" trademark of the Jinglun Shirt and Sock Factory, stating: "On the 27th of this month, we received a letter from the Jinglun Shirt and Sock Factory stating that the Italian Yixing Company was dissatisfied with the Trademark Bureau's evaluation of the 'Lion Ball' trademark and requested a re-evaluation. We have copied a copy of the bureau's order and the company's request for re-evaluation and request your assistance, etc. After investigation, the main point of the Italian Yixing Company's request for re-evaluation is that they have abandoned the point of arguing about the 'actual first user' in Article Tian of the Trademark Law, and what they are trying their best to declare is the phrase 'continuously used in good faith for more than five years' in Article 4 of the Trademark Law. What they mean by 'good faith user' is nothing more than that 'the applicant was unaware that the respondent has been using the Lion Ball pattern for 30 years, otherwise the applicant would never have adopted this pattern.' And the proof that they would never adopt it is that 'the respondent has always threatened the applicant to stop using the pattern.' The important key to this case is whether the so-called proof that they 'continuously used it in good faith for more than five years before the implementation of the Trademark Law' is true. It should be known that before the implementation of the Trademark Law, the power to resolve this kind of dispute with foreigners did not lie with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, but with the Mixed Court of the Concession. If Chinese merchants wanted to request the cessation of the pattern, firstly, the Trademark Law had not been promulgated at that time and there was no basis for it, and secondly, foreign-related lawsuits in the Mixed Court were all related to the interests of the consuls of various countries. As a result of the conflict of interests between China and the West, the verdicts of the judge and the presiding judge often differed, resulting in the police taking orders from the execution. Therefore, the 'danger' that the applicant mentioned can be definitely said not to have occurred. Anyone familiar with the situation of the Mixed Court at that time is familiar with and has heard of this. The applicant cannot make claims based on empty words. Therefore, according to the above conclusion, the only key point that the applicant relies on to prove that they 'continuously used it in good faith for more than five years before the implementation of the Trademark Law' has been fundamentally shaken, and their request to invoke Article 4 of the Trademark Law is naturally untenable. In addition to the factory submitting a written defense according to the law, in response to the letter, we hereby submit to your bureau in detail the opinions of our association on this case for your review and handling. This is extremely appreciated. Sincerely, to the Trademark Bureau."</p>

<h3 id="e33">Mitsui &amp; Co. Sues for Goods <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Lawyers for both sides debated qualifications yesterday.</p>
<p>The court set a deadline for correction.</p>
<p>Mitsui &amp; Co. sued He Gengxing and Hong Cangting for failing to pay for goods. In the previous hearing by the Special District Court, Hong's lawyer, Mr. Zhang Rongxi, raised the issue of the legal status of the foreign merchant, arguing that the foreign merchant had not registered with the Chinese government and could not be recognized as a legal person. At that time, the presiding judge ruled that the plaintiff should correct the registration procedures and reschedule the hearing. This has been reported in this newspaper. The registration of foreign merchants is now trending towards becoming a reality from theory. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government is also actively handling the registration of foreign merchants to meet the needs. Yesterday morning, Mr. Zhang Guoquan held another hearing on the case. After 9:00 AM, many Japanese people in Shanghai went to the Eighth Civil Court of the Special District Court to listen. Japanese newspapers and news agencies run by Japanese people all sent reporters to the court to record. Japanese news reporters have never paid as much attention to the court as Western newspapers. The fact that they sent reporters to the court for this case shows their attitude towards the case. At 10:30 AM, the case was heard. The defendant, He Gengxing, was still at large and did not arrive. The defendant, Hong Cangting, was still represented by Lawyer Zhang. First, Mr. Okamoto, the lawyer representing the plaintiff, the Japanese company Mitsui &amp; Co., stood up and translated, saying that Lawyer Zhang had raised the issue of legal person in the previous hearing as a countermeasure. After the presiding judge ruled, our lawyer collected all the materials and described the reasons in detail. In addition to what is stated in writing, I will add an oral statement. According to the defendant's lawyer, any foreign firm that has not registered has no right to sue, and a foreign legal person who wants to sue in a Chinese court should register in accordance with Chinese law. Our lawyer believes that any foreign legal person who still enjoys consular jurisdiction is not bound by Chinese law. Therefore, since the signing of the so-called unequal treaties, this problem has never occurred. If you want to change the course of action, you should first start with the so-called unequal treaties. The first article of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and the US-Japanese Treaty of Commerce both stipulate that the people of the two contracting countries should abide by all the laws of the other contracting country when doing business in the other contracting country, and should enjoy the same rights and obligations as the people of any contracting country. However, the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce does not have this provision. Therefore, Japanese merchants are not bound by Chinese law, and the National Government has never objected to the rights enjoyed by Japan. Other Chinese courts have also never ordered Japanese people to be subject to Chinese law. This is because the Sino-Japanese Treaty still exists. Moreover, the Chinese Civil Law and other laws do not apply to the people of countries that enjoy jurisdiction, so Chinese courts have never denied the legal status of foreign merchants because they have not registered in China. The lawyer then cited several types of laws, such as the precedent of the Supreme Court, saying that since the Chinese court had previously recognized foreign merchants as plaintiffs, it naturally recognized that they had the right to sue and had legal person status. Moreover, Mitsui &amp; Co. had registered in its own country and obtained legal person status, so it should be recognized as a legal person in any country. After searching through Chinese law, there is no clear provision on how foreign legal persons should register. As for the existence of capacity, according to Chinese law, the court should investigate ex officio and should not wait for the other party to raise it. In the past, there were many foreign merchants who sued in Chinese courts, and this kind of problem never occurred. Since the Chinese court accepted foreign merchants' lawsuits, it had already recognized that they had the right to sue. Recently, the Supreme Court accepted a case where the plaintiff was also a Japanese merchant, and the Supreme Court never inquired about the qualifications, and the Japanese merchant was an unregistered merchant in China. Even your court has recently accepted foreign merchants' lawsuits without any such objections. Although the articles formulated by the Public Concession, which contain the language of applying Chinese law, have been withdrawn, it means that they include old precedents or customs that have not been recognized by the government. As for those bound by treaties, Chinese law does not apply. Even if Chinese law applies to foreign merchants, foreign merchants do not need to register in China. According to the provisions of the Registration Law, registration should be requested from the local government office, but our lawyer has inquired about the registration procedures from your court, and your court has not yet prepared. From this, it can be seen that China does not really want foreign merchants to register, and it can be seen that Chinese law is still in its infancy. In short, in this case, (1) Chinese law cannot be applied to countries that enjoy treaty rights; (2) incomplete Chinese laws cannot be applied to foreigners. The presiding judge listened attentively to this point and felt that Lawyer Okamoto's words were extremely flawed. If he continued to tolerate him, he might become even more presumptuous, so he quickly corrected him and said: "What this court wants to discuss is the law, but what your lawyer said mostly involves jurisdiction. You don't know that jurisdiction is a diplomatic issue and is actually wrong. Your lawyer is concerned about the fact that Japan is a country that enjoys consular jurisdiction. From a legal point of view, I believe that jurisdiction is not a natural right, but is constituted by a treaty. The Sino-Japanese Treaty expired last year. This court has received instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to guide the handling of litigation by the people of countries whose treaties have expired in accordance with the seven articles of the measures stipulated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The people of all countries whose treaties have expired are treated the same as the people of countries that have no treaties. This kind of measure is not only for Japan. However, since Japan is a country whose treaty has expired, it should be handled in accordance with these measures. Later, when observing the point that the consuls of those whose treaties have expired all came to the hearing based on the old treaty because the new treaty had not been concluded, until the National Government clearly ordered the abolition of consular jurisdiction in China on the first day of this year and re-established the measures for post-restitution. This court has always advocated that anyone under the jurisdiction of this court, regardless of their nationality, should be treated the same as Chinese people. Chinese law applies to this court. The Japanese consul also signed the agreement to reorganize the provisional court. Now, suppose a Chinese company sues this court in the name of a legal person. It should of course register with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. At this time when the old treaty has expired and the new treaty has not been signed, we should urgently abide by Chinese law. The Company Law has been promulgated, although it has not yet been implemented. However, there are still company regulations that can be used. How can it be said that there is no law? The second point that your lawyer argues is that Chinese law is incomplete. But as far as the law of this case is concerned, I think it is sufficient to make considerable references. It must be known that company registration is different from foundation registration. Company registration should be submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and does not fall within the scope of the local government office. As for the ability to sue, it is true that the court should investigate ex officio. However, in the past, since the other party did not raise any objections, why should the government be so picky? In the future, I will pay more attention to this matter. If any discoveries are made, I will give temporary relief. However, the right to sue cannot be deprived because they do not have legal person status. However, the plaintiff's written reasons are lengthy and have not been carefully reviewed. I am now pointing out the mistakes that have been found. As for whether there are any inappropriate points, I will not discuss them for the time being." Next, Lawyer Zhang refuted each of the points made by Okamoto, stating briefly that although the reasons stated by the plaintiff's lawyer were extremely lengthy, they were also extremely inadequate. All the answers were nothing more than (1) which is stronger, the effect of law or treaty? According to international law, treaties that concern the interests of the people should only take effect after being passed by the country. Laws can abolish treaties, and treaties can also abolish laws. New laws can also abolish old treaties. Even Japanese jurists recognize this theory. (2) In international law, the four characters "consular jurisdiction" cannot be recognized. Moreover, jurisdiction has now been explicitly abolished, and the Sino-Japanese Treaty has also expired and the new treaty has not been concluded. How can Mitsui &amp; Co. continue to invoke jurisdiction? However, let's talk about the effect of jurisdiction. It can only affect foreigners who are defendants. If a foreigner is a plaintiff, they must sue the Chinese court in accordance with Chinese law. Even if they have jurisdiction, they cannot be exempted. Since Mitsui is the plaintiff, it should be handled in accordance with Chinese law. The plaintiff's lawyer said that foreign legal persons have previously sued in China, so the Chinese court has recognized them as legal persons. They don't know that most foreigners are in the Public Concession. Although the Public Concession was established based on the Yangjingbang Regulations, it has lost its legal status since the Xinhai Revolution because it was managed by foreigners. Therefore, the Supreme Court ruled in the sixth year that the judgments of the Public Concession are not effective. Although it was later changed to a provisional court, it was only a change between the local government and the consular corps. It was actually a temporary situation and still had no legitimate status in law. Now, a special representative of the state has been appointed to establish an agreement organization and a formal court. All Chinese laws, whether substantive law or procedural law, apply to it. All the bad habits of the past cannot be used. If those foreigners sue your court, they should abide by Chinese law, otherwise it would be illegal. Chinese law stipulates that those who do not have the ability to sue should have their lawsuits rejected. (3) The plaintiff's lawyer also said that Chinese law is incomplete and that they have no way to obtain legal person status. This shows that they have no understanding of Chinese law as a whole. As far as our lawyer knows, Chinese law is extremely complete, extremely broad, and has many advantages. It is better than the laws of any country. There are many legal provisions for foreign merchants to obtain legal person status in accordance with Chinese law. The lawyer then pointed out the applicable legal provisions one by one, saying that anyone, regardless of their nationality, can obtain the same status and rights as Chinese legal persons if they follow the law. What they call incomplete is really a frog in a well. The lawyer then explained in detail Article 8 of the Company Regulations, which states that "before registration, they shall not resist third parties." Finally, they requested the court to decide on a period of time so that the plaintiff could correct the procedures as the case cannot be delayed again and again. If the correction is not made by the deadline, their lawsuit will be rejected. The presiding judge then ordered that the hearing be rescheduled to July 30 and that the plaintiff should correct the procedures within the deadline before announcing the adjournment. It was already one o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e34">A Record of the Departure of the Asia Walking Group Yesterday <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The Friendship Travel Group gave very earnest farewell remarks.</p>
<p>Nine young men and women of the Chinese Youth Asia Walking Group gathered at the North Station at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. They were carrying luggage and blankets, water bottles, oil cloths, backpacks, compasses, and other items, each weighing 30 pounds. They were all dressed in yellow serge scout uniforms and wore white copper basin hats. Teachers and students from various schools and representatives from various organizations went to see them off, which was very enthusiastic. First, photographers from various newspapers took photos of each individual, and then took a group photo with the guests. They also asked the stationmaster and the general manager of the transportation department to sign and verify the departure. At the time of departure, the Friendship Travel Group elected Huang Xincun to give a farewell speech, imitating the meaning of farewell remarks of the ancients. He said briefly that the news of your grand tour has spread all over the country and has touched the dreams of Chinese youth. It is a great honor for the Chinese nation, and there are three female comrades who are fighting for freedom. It can be said to be a sweet long journey. We originally intended to buy many gifts to pay tribute, but we thought that the group rules limited the weight, so we could not fulfill our wish. We specially entrusted me to express a few words as follows: (1) Study the subjects of road education and social universities. (2) How to travel economically, save time and energy. (3) Awaken the public everywhere and pay attention to the people's illnesses. (4) Experiment with travel hygiene, do not drink dirty water or eat raw and cold food in hot weather. (5) Talk less, do more, run less, rest more. (6) Help each other, cooperate, and accept the advice of elders. (7) Cherish the reputation of the group and respect public decisions. (8) Visit and collect botanical specimens everywhere and send good news to the Shanghai Report, etc. When departing, the Oriental Bookstore Publishing House set off a large number of firecrackers, and the sound of explosions was endless. Hundreds of people sent them off. The group lined up and marched west with a tragic and silent attitude. When passing by Guanghua University, they specially prepared tea and snacks to welcome them. When passing by Longhua, they encountered a heavy rain, but they still marched forward in the rain. Last night, they stayed overnight in the fields near Xinzhuang. They set out at 5:00 AM this morning and walked to Songjiang, where they were received by Songjiang Girls' High School or will stay for a few days.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Case of the Protection Corps Shooting Li Zhonghua <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Seeking Handwriting from Loan Shark Account Books</p>
<p>Prosecutor Changes Course After Argument</p>
<p>The case of Li Zhonghua (also known as Li Zhongyi), a loan shark, who was shot in the right arm by the Shanghai South City Protection Corps while attempting to apprehend bandits, was brought to court by Li's wife, Li Wangshi. After questioning and gathering evidence, the District Court Prosecutor's Office charged the Protection Corps with suspicion of murder and filed a public lawsuit. The Criminal Court judges then conducted a public trial, ordering both parties to present their witnesses to testify to everything. The details of which have been reported in previous newspapers. Now, we will provide a detailed account of the causes, consequences, and yesterday's continued trial, including Li Zhonghua's detention.</p>
<p>Chen Liangsheng Receives Threatening Letter. Chen Liangsheng (previously mistakenly reported as Chen Liangyu), a local resident, is 40 years old and lives at No. 49 Zhao Jiawan Street, Xiaonanmen. As a silk merchant, he is quite well-off, making him a target for bandits. In March and April of this year, he received three threatening letters from bandits. Two of the letters were written in ink, and one in blue ink, demanding 600 yuan. They also threatened that if he didn't pay, they would proceed with a kidnapping, with a minimum ransom of 10,000 yuan. The payment location was repeatedly reported as the front of the Zhengde School on Xiaozha Bridge Street, Xiaonanmen, with a red wood shop identified by a newspaper. After receiving the letter, Chen immediately reported to the seventh squad of the Protection Corps and requested an investigation.</p>
<p>Li Zhonghua Places a Newspaper. After receiving the report, Ma Wenda, the captain of the seventh squad, secretly dispatched platoon leader Jin Shunyi to supervise corps members Gu Guo'an, Lin Jinxian, and others, all in disguise, to the location designated by the bandits at 10:00 PM on April 21 (the date agreed upon by the bandits) for an ambush. At the appointed time, Li Zhonghua arrived and took a newspaper from his bag, placing it on the red wood. Unexpectedly, the wind blew it to the ground. Li picked up the newspaper and placed it back on the red wood, then picked up a brick to weigh it down to prevent it from being blown away by the wind. The corps members witnessed this and rushed out, shouting for him to stop. Li made a gesture to shoot, and the corps members, in self-defense, had to shoot, injuring his right arm. At the time, Li was detained by the first district, third precinct, and then sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound.</p>
<p>Engaged in Loan Sharking for Years. Li Zhonghua (also known as Li Zhongyi, Zhongyi, and Li Zhongyi) is from Zhili Province, 37 years old. He was formerly a police officer in the Security Squad of the former Police Department. After leaving the police force, he made a living as a loan shark, living with his wife, Wang, at No. 37 North Tangfang Lane, Xiaonanmen. He has over 100 borrowers, making a considerable profit. It is believed that Li has been lending money for over ten years. Therefore, most of the old goods vendors and brokers in the South City area know Li Zhonghua. However, his reputation is quite bad, and it was unexpected that he would engage in such extortion.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Alleges Li Was Wronged. After Li was injured and sent to the hospital, his wife, Li Wangshi, was encouraged by others to file a complaint with the District Court Prosecutor's Office, claiming that the Protection Corps should not have opened fire rashly and injured an innocent citizen, requesting an investigation. Prosecutor Xu Heling ordered the summoning of Protection Corps platoon leader Jin Shunchang, Gu Guo'an, and others for questioning. For the sake of caution, a letter was sent to the Public Security Bureau for verification. The bureau replied, stating that Li Zhonghua's behavior was usually very good and that he had no illegal activities. Based on the reply, the prosecutor filed a public lawsuit, accusing Jin Shunchang and Gu Guo'an of committing the crime of murder under Article 282, Section 2 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>Handwriting on Small Account Books. After the incident, Ma Wenda, captain of the seventh squad of the Protection Corps, paid close attention to investigating the facts, collecting all kinds of evidence. He led corps members Yu Ruixiang, Peng Rongquan, and others to the homes of Li Zhonghua's borrowers, such as Kang Jiabao, Zhou Abing, Gao Fuxing, and others, to investigate and confirm that Li Zhonghua had loaned them money.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The printing of money was indeed true. Captain Ma sent a letter to the first district party headquarters, explaining the situation to Kang Jiabao and others, and brought back four small account books used by Li Zhonghua for printing money to the party headquarters, giving them a receipt. The party headquarters then sent a letter along with the four small account books to Captain Ma. It was discovered that one of the account books was written in blue ink, and the depth of the color matched the blue ink threatening letter sent to Chen Liangsheng's house. The most surprising thing was that the character "jia" (家, home) in Kang Jiabao's name matched the character "jia" (家, home) in "Zhao Jiawan Street" on Chen's letter, proving that the threatening letter was indeed written by Li Zhonghua. Captain Ma immediately submitted the account books and the letter from the party headquarters to lawyer Tang Yingsong, who presented them in court during the first public trial and requested an examination.</p>
<p>Presenting Evidence of Interest Rates. The first public trial was on the morning of the 14th of this month. The judge paid close attention to the handwriting on the account books. At that time, Li Zhonghua was ordered to write down the addresses of the witnesses. Li claimed that he could not write and that his arm was injured and he could not hold a pen. After the court adjourned, Li immediately went around collecting his account books from all the debtors. The debtors were surprised as to why he would take back the account books when the money had not been paid off. It was said that it was difficult to collect all the account books because there were many household names, and it took until dawn the next day to collect them all. This is worth studying. During the second Criminal Court hearing, the witnesses presented by Li Zhonghua all claimed that they had borrowed money from Li, but it was not loan sharking, but rather interest was charged at two percent per month. In fact, their testimony was contradictory. For example, if they borrowed ten yuan, the monthly interest rate should be twenty cents, but the witnesses claimed that it was twenty cents.</p>
<p>Detailed Interrogation of Li Zhonghua. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Wu Zhen and Prosecutor Xu Heling opened the second courtroom. The officer first ordered Li Zhonghua to the dock and asked: (Q) Do you know Kang Jiabao? (A) I know him. (Q) Has he borrowed money from you? (A) No. (Q) Did he borrow 15,000 cash from you in February and 10,000 cash in March? (A) No. (Q) If you didn't lend him money, why did he say you lent him money? Moreover, there is your account book. (A) The account book is not mine. The officer said, "Kang Jiabao testified in court that you are a big man. What do you have to say?" (A) I have been in the South City for over ten years, so they know me. (Q) Did you lend money to Zhou Abing? (A) Yes, he borrowed five yuan from me and has already paid it back. Later, I introduced someone named Ma to lend him money. The officer showed Zhou Abing's account book to Li. (A) It's not mine. (Q) Have you lent money to Gao Fuxing? (A) I don't know him. The officer said, "He said you lent him money. How can you say you don't know him?" He also showed Gao Fuxing's account book to him. (A) It's not mine. I lent money at two percent interest, not loan sharking. They are framing me." The officer ordered Jin Shunchang and Gu Guo'an to the dock and asked, "What else do you have to say?" Jin and Gu replied, "Nothing." At this point, lawyer Tang stood up and said, "The characters 'jia' and 'bao' (家保, home protection) on Kang Jiabao's account book are exactly the same as the characters 'jia' and 'bao' on the threatening letter, and they are both written in blue ink. The court should pay attention to this." The officer asked Prosecutor Xu to stand up and argue, stating, "Based on the Public Security Bureau's reply, Li Zhonghua is a good man, so the prosecutor believes that the Protection Corps is suspected of murder and filed a public lawsuit. However, the results of the trial, based on the party headquarters' letter and the money printing account books, show that Li Zhonghua is strongly suspected of handwriting. However, Jin Shunchang and Gu Guo'an did not have any major circumstances. Only that they did not report the arrest to the police station beforehand. The presiding judge should decide." At this point, lawyer Tang stood up and argued, stating, "The premise should be whether the threatening letter was written by Li Zhonghua. The actions of the defendants Jin Shunchang, Gu Guo'an, etc. are completely legal. As for not reporting to the police, it is within the scope of administration. Moreover, the handwriting matches completely. At the time, Li Zhonghua's every move, time, location, and objects were exactly the same as the threatening letter. Furthermore, the witnesses presented by Li Zhonghua testified that the time was 7:00 or 8:00 PM, but the incident occurred before 11:00 PM. The court should declare them innocent." Then, Feng Buqing, the lawyer hired by Li Zhonghua, stood up and requested a private lawsuit, stating that Li Zhonghua could not live after being shot in the arm and should be paid 15 yuan per month for living expenses for twenty years. The officer then announced that the debate in this case was concluded and that the verdict would be announced at 2:00 PM on the 30th of this month. Jin Shunchang and Gu Guo'an were ordered to leave. Li Zhonghua was ordered to be taken down and detained by the bailiffs. After the court adjourned, Prosecutor Xu opened a special investigation court and ordered Li Zhonghua to be brought in for questioning. He ruled that he should be returned to custody to await a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>Death to the Murderer is Expected</p>
<p>Qian Jiagen, the main culprit in the assassination of Shen Dingyi, a member of the First Central Committee, is 26 years old this year and a native of Sheng County. In 1928, he assassinated Shen in front of the Reformatory and fled to the Harbin Shipyard to work as a laborer, intending to change his name and escape justice. Unexpectedly, he was exposed by a close friend. The Zhejiang Provincial Government sent a letter to the Harbin authorities requesting the arrest of Qian Jiagen. He has now been escorted south and passed through Shanghai yesterday. Qian was escorted to the District Court for temporary detention so that the Zhejiang authorities could transfer him back for trial. However, Qian Jiagen's attitude was very calm, stating that "Death to the murderer is expected."</p>
<h3 id="e37">Nantong Bandit Pan Zihong <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Arrested for Evil Deeds in Pudong</p>
<p>Pan Zihong, a notorious bandit from Jinsha Town, Nantong County, was wanted for multiple cases of kidnapping and murder. He fled to Shanghai and hid in the home of his fellow villager, Gu Longsheng, in Lujiazai, Pudong, disguised as a worker and gambling all day long. On the night of the 22nd of this month, he gathered to gamble at Gu's place again. Chen Guangyan, a detective from the Third District Public Security Bureau, learned of this and secretly reported it to the District Chief, who dispatched police officers to arrest Pan. According to Pan's confession, he is 29 years old and from Tongzhou. He came to Shanghai last month to find work but was unsuccessful and lived idly at his friend's place, denying being a bandit. The District Chief ordered him to be temporarily detained and sent a letter to the Ninth District Office in Tongzhou to investigate whether he was a law-abiding citizen. Yesterday, a reply was received from the head of the office, stating that Pan Zihong was indeed a wanted criminal in Tongzhou for multiple cases and had been repeatedly sought without success. Please escort him for questioning and trial. District Chief Zhang immediately prepared a document ordering the transfer of the bandit Pan to the Public Security Bureau for questioning and trial.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Jail Guards Strike <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>One Arrested Out of More Than Fifty</p>
<p>The Da Wan Bao reported that fifty jail guards and police officers at the Huade Road prison went on strike yesterday because the leader they had elected was not appointed by the police authorities, and the newly appointed leader was not of the same rank as them. In the afternoon, they gathered at the British Consulate General to meet with officials and demand the replacement of the new leader. When Consul Bailun came out to inquire about the matter and advised them to abide by discipline and return to duty, the guards refused. Chief Inspector Qiu Laide ordered them to report for duty before 6:00 PM, otherwise they would be fired. The crowd still lingered at the consulate and dispersed after 6:00 PM. This morning, they went to the consulate again and were joined by some sympathizers and agitators, adding several demands. Gan Naitai, the deputy chief inspector in charge of the special police officers, ordered everyone to gather in a circle and listen to Consul Bailun's advice. During Consul Bailun's speech, the head of the prison, Lusi, arrested Bu Xin, a sympathizer among the dismissed jail guards and police officers, accusing him of inciting arson at the consulate. It is said that he will be sent to the British Public Hall for trial on Monday. After Consul Bailun finished his speech, everyone dispersed. Because they failed to report for duty last night, their names have been automatically removed from the police station's roster.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Jiangbei People Clash with Guangdong People <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Minor Cause, Many Injuries</p>
<p>At around 6:00 PM last night, there was an armed clash between Jiangbei people and Guangdong people on the vacant lot at the end of Dong Zhangjia Road, Zhonghongqiao. There were about one hundred and seventy or eighty people on both sides, using iron rulers and sharp blades as weapons. Fortunately, passersby reported the incident to the Linping Road police station of the Third Precinct of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, and all the police officers set out and arrested nineteen people involved. Ten of them were seriously injured and were sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The cause of this incident was minor, but the two sides were eager to fight privately, which led to a major disaster. It turned out that Liu Yongfu, a Jiangbei person, opened a pancake shop on Zhangqiao Road. Yesterday evening, after finishing work, he was walking on the road when he saw a rental sign posted on the door of Tongliyuan Heji Niupihao (leather shop) and craned his neck to look. At that time, Dai Yin, the Cantonese doorman of Tongliyuan, was particularly attentive to the doorway because he had been robbed a few days ago. Seeing Liu pacing and staring at the door, he questioned him. The two sides could not understand each other and suddenly started arguing, followed by physical violence. The workers of the leather factory heard the noise and gathered to watch, joining in the fight. Even more people from Jiangbei came to rescue Liu Yongfu, quickly gathering more than a hundred people. The Cantonese side also had sixty or seventy people. Fortunately, a passerby, Chen Wan, went to the Linqing Road police station of the Third Precinct of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau to report the incident. The police officers immediately went to disperse the crowd and arrested the perpetrators. However, when the police arrived, the two sides had already had some contact, and weapons such as sharp knives and long spears had already been used. By the time the police arrived at the end of Zhangqiao Road, the clever ones had already escaped without a trace. Only those who were injured and stubborn were arrested and taken to the station. The main person involved, Liu Yongfu, was injured all over his body and, along with Sun Zitian, was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment with Ye Yaoji, Yang Zanbian, Wang Xin, Cai Busheng, Dai Jin, Yang Fa, and others. Among them, Liu Yongfu, Cai Busheng, and Sun Zitian were from Jiangbei, while the rest were Cantonese. Others who were slightly injured or not injured at all included Dai Yin, the instigator, and accomplices Zhong Hua, Li Jun, Liu Jian, Li Long, Cai Bang, Yang Fa, Zhang Yaoheng, Li Ruyou, Huo Zhishui, Yang Dan, and others, a total of eleven people. There was also a Zhu Changshun, who surrendered himself to the station. Among the above-mentioned ten people, Zhang Yaoheng, Li Ruyou, Huo Zhishui, and Yang Dan were all members of the Tongqunle Martial Arts Association on Qiujiang Road. They claimed that the long spears and knives they brought were because they heard that their fellow villagers were surrounded by the Jiangbei gang and hired cars to transport long spears and short knives to rescue them. As for the cause of the incident, the Cantonese side claimed that the Jiangbei people had been extorting money, and Liu Yongfu was suspected of theft. Both sides insisted on their own versions, which were quite different. However, it is undeniable that the two sides had been harboring resentment for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Lu Gengrong Case Reopened for Debate Yesterday <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Debate Concluded, Verdict Tomorrow</p>
<p>The case of the love affair between the master and servant, Huang and Lu, regarding the part of Lu Gengrong helping to steal, was returned to the High Court for retrial by the Supreme Court. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Zhao Zhengzhang, acting presiding judge of the First Criminal Court of the High Court, together with prosecutor Jin Henian, assessor judges, and court clerks, reopened the debate court. Huang Zhushi, mother of Huang Huiru, was summoned. Lu Zhenrong and Lu's defense lawyer, Song Mingxun, also appeared in court. About 300 people were in attendance. The hearing lasted about an hour before it ended. Because the case attracted special attention from society, the judge interrogated in detail. The details are as follows. After the court opened, Lu Gengrong was first brought to the court. Judge Zhao asked his name, age, and place of origin, and then announced the reason for reopening the debate. Then, Huang Zhushi was summoned for questioning. Huang Zhushi testified that she was 49 years old, from Wuxing, Zhejiang. She originally lived on Hed Road in Shanghai and now lives at No. 23 West Zhijia Lane in Suzhou. The official asked if Huang Huiru was dead or not. She replied that she had died long ago. The official asked if the "Third Miss" reported in the newspaper was her niece. She replied that it was a relative who lived with her. There was no one left in her family, so she lived with her. The official asked when Lu Gengrong came to her house and what she meant by hiring lawyer Pan Chenge today. She replied that she hired a lawyer to prove that Lu Gengrong had indeed taken the things out and that he was not wronged. Lu Gengrong came to her house on September 13, 1927, to work as a tea server. The official asked when Huang Huiru and Lu Gengrong started their relationship and whether it was in January 1928. She replied that she did not know at first, but later she knew after Lu Gengrong and her daughter Huiru left together. On the twelfth day, Gengrong went out and did not show her the things as usual. She suspected something and questioned her daughter, asking when Gengrong left. She replied that it was 4:00 PM on the twelfth. Later, when the lights came on at 6:00 or 7:00 PM, she discovered that something was missing. She asked Huiru, and Huiru said that Lu Gengrong had ordered her to take it, and now Lu Gengrong had taken it away. This was said in the room, and no one else heard it. At that time, Jin Ma and A Jin were both working downstairs and probably did not hear it. The official asked when Huiru told her about the things being deposited in Qu Xingtai's carpentry shop. She replied that Huiru was unwilling to speak at first, but she bought them after she scolded her. She spoke one or two days later. The official asked if Huiru left on the thirteenth, how could she speak to her one or two days later? Perhaps it was at night on the twelfth? She replied no, she spoke after the District Court verdict. The official asked if there was no such statement in the first trial court record. She asked if she had stated this in the first trial complaint. She replied that she had. Today, she said that Huiru only spoke to her after the first trial verdict. When did Huiru tell her? She replied that she did not remember. The official asked if Huiru had not seen her when she went out. She replied that she saw Huiru go downstairs early in the morning on the thirteenth. At that time, the servants had not gotten up, but she had not slept all night. She chased her downstairs, but she had already gone out. She chased her to the door, but she was no longer to be seen. According to people nearby, there was a car, but she did not see it herself. This was because Huiru was fast. In her opinion, it was not easy to hide things in summer clothes. The official asked if she had shouted at her when she chased her that day. She replied that she had shouted at her, but she had already gone out and did not answer. The official asked where the jewelry box was placed. She replied that it was in the room under the bed, against the north. The official asked how many people there were in total. She replied that there were only her mother and daughter. The official asked if Lu Gengrong had gone upstairs on the twelfth. She replied that he had not gone upstairs. The official asked if there was a small leather box that she said she gave to him. She replied that there was. The official asked why she did not report the theft at 7:00 PM that day when she knew that things were missing. She replied that it was because it was late. The official asked why she said it was late at 7:00 PM. She asked where Qu Xingtai's carpentry shop was. She replied that she did not know. She only found out later because she did not go out much. Later, she went to inquire and he had moved and was no longer on Hed Road. The official asked if she could find Qu Xingtai now. She replied that she could not find him. She did not even know if Lu Gengrong had any cousins ​​there. The official asked if she said in the first trial complaint that Lu Gengrong deposited the things in Qu Xingtai's carpentry shop with his cousin Lu Yongqing. Now she said she did not know about it. How could she say that? Was Jin Ma and A Jin summoned today? She replied that they had not been summoned. Jin Ma quit last year and A Jin went to the countryside in 1928. The official asked if they could not be found. The official asked if Huiru had always protected Lu Gengrong in previous court trials. Why did she not help her mother instead? She replied yes, but Huiru had cried out in grievance when she was seriously ill, saying that she had been deceived by Lu Gengrong. The official asked when she had repented. She replied that it was in the hospital. He said that he had a good life at home, but he did not expect to be in danger after being deceived. She asked me to take him home, and he died on the road at 4:00 PM that afternoon. Lu Gengrong took the things because my daughter Huiru did not want to take my things. After Lu Gengrong took them away, Lu Gengrong's cousin Lu Yongqing kept them for him. The official asked if there was any evidence that Lu Gengrong took the things to prosecute him. She replied that it was not a miscarriage of justice. She did not have anything else to say. At that point, the official asked again what she meant by hiring a lawyer today. Did she want him to testify? She replied that she did not call him to testify. The official asked if all the words she said were her own and did not need him to say on her behalf. She replied yes. The official asked if she had anything else to say. She replied that her family was now ruined and she did not have the face to see anyone in Shanghai, so she avoided going to Suzhou. She asked the court to judge Gengrong's crime. She did not have anything else to say. Next, Lu Gengrong was summoned for questioning. The official asked if he had heard what Huang Zhushi had said just now and what he had to say. Lu replied that it was a miscarriage of justice. First, on the fourth day after I came out of the exchange, I went to Huang's house to return the bedding. The small box I took out was given to me by Madam. Madam checked the contents of the box, which were clothes and other items. Also, Madam saw me leave at 9:00 AM when I left. Now she said it was 4:00 PM, which is not the right time. Second, Qu Xingtai's carpentry shop had been doing business with Huang's family long before I went to Huang's house. Now Huang Zhushi said she did not know them. This is the second point that is not right. As for my relationship with Miss, it has been stated in previous court trials. Moreover, she now said that Jin Ma and A Jin were nowhere to be found, which shows that Huang Zhushi was not telling the truth. Then, Prosecutor Jin stood up to argue, stating that the case was reopened for a more detailed investigation. Based on today's results, there was no change from the previous argument. Finally, the presiding judge ordered the court clerk to read the testimony of Huang Zhushi and Lu Gengrong, who signed their names separately. Lu Gengrong also stated that he had been in prison for two years and asked the court to appeal for grievances. The presiding judge then announced that the debate in this case was concluded and that the verdict would be announced at 2:00 PM on the 30th of this month. The court adjourned and Lu Gengrong was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Wu Guanghua Stands Out</p>
<p>The Ge Lei Lie Cup competition is a shooting competition that the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Chinese Company places great emphasis on, so they have always been at the top of various competitions.

Last year, the team won with a score of 777 points against Singapore's 759 points. This year, the Shanghai competition was held at the shooting range on the morning of the 27th. The sun was scorching and the heat was oppressive. The competitors did not let the sweat pouring down their faces diminish their courage. They were all determined, solemn, and brave. It was heard that the team had specially invited General Headquarters Hu Guojun, Akio staff officer Henry Kreiff, and officials and clerks, as well as the competition gun club's committee member Kalaso and the team's captain Wang Yanqing to the scene to judge and score. It was learned that the team's shooting performance in this year's competition was even better than last year. The best shooter was Wu Guanghua, a private in the team, who scored 91 points. It is said that this competitor has been in the team for less than three years and has already achieved this first-class result, which is truly commendable. Sergeant Wang Zixiang scored 82 points.

<h3 id="e45">All Zhejiang Relief Association Performing Opera to Raise Funds <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Two Days and Two Nights: July 4th and 5th</p>
<p>Distinguished amateur actors will perform Peking Opera</p>
<p>Each ticket comes with a complimentary "Kindness Fruit" coupon</p>
<p>The All Zhejiang Relief Association in Shanghai has previously issued "Kindness Fruit" coupons, priced at five yuan each, with books and paintings offered as gifts to encourage sales. All proceeds went towards disaster relief. Due to widespread disasters in various provinces and the ongoing war, the association has been tirelessly promoting the coupons, but many remain unsold. Now that the drawing date is approaching, the Standing Committee of the association has devised a plan to raise funds through opera performances. They have entrusted individuals to seek assistance and have successfully secured commitments from various amateur actors to perform Peking Opera at the Grand Theater on San Ma Road on the nights of July 4th and 5th. Each opera ticket will be sold for five yuan and will include a complimentary "Kindness Fruit" coupon. The association has extended invitations to prominent figures in politics, renowned personalities, wealthy merchants, and elegant ladies. Names like Tianju Jushi Zhang Xiaolin, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Weiru, Qiu Jianfei, Hong Yanbin, Xie Baosheng, Rong Boming, He Wuliang, and Sun Lanting, as well as Mrs. Wang Xiaolai, Mrs. Du Yuesheng, Ms. Jiang Wencai, and Ms. Xiao Lan, are all highly respected. These individuals, who normally would not readily perform on stage, are making an exception at the request of the Relief Association, gracing the stage with their presence. It is believed that those who purchase tickets, spending a mere five yuan, will not only contribute to the disaster relief effort but also appreciate high art and have the chance to win a prize. It is anticipated that the bustling streets of Shanghai will experience even greater excitement, proving the Relief Association's hard work worthwhile.</p>

<p>Hu Liangen and Du Axing Escape the Fire Pit</p>
<p>An old woman named Zhang Jinshi, residing at Huoban Lane, Hangzhou City Station, is a matchmaker of sorts. Each year, she travels between Shanghai and Hangzhou, claiming to find employment for impoverished women, but in reality, she traffics them into prostitution. Recently, she boasted to her neighbors that she was familiar with Shanghai's famous three major companies and that most of their female escorts were introduced by her, claiming it was highly lucrative. Two young ladies from humble families, Hu Liangen and Du Axing, both around seventeen or eighteen years old, were enticed by her claims and pleaded for her help. Zhang readily agreed, stating that there would be business opportunities in Shanghai and instructed the two girls to follow her. The girls happily complied, but upon arriving in Shanghai, no company or escort positions were found. Instead, the two girls were sold to a meat shop on Avenue Edward VII. For only five days, the madam and procurer forced the girls to receive clients every night. The two girls, unable to bear the torment and suffering, used the four dollars they had and fled to the South Railway Station early yesterday morning to purchase tickets to return to Hangzhou. They were about to board the train in twenty minutes when the procurer and Zhang Jinshi discovered their escape and pursued them to the station, intending to force them to return. A patrolling police officer noticed the commotion and intervened. The procurer fled, but Zhang Jinshi was apprehended and taken to the police station for questioning. After clarifying the situation, she was immediately sent to the local court for interrogation by the prosecutor, who ordered her detention. The two girls were sent to the hall to await their families to claim them.</p>

<p>Yi Tingzai Rescued After Jumping into the River</p>
<p>Yesterday at half past noon, a young man boarded a ferry from the Ning Shao Wharf at the Sixteenth Bund to Lujiazui. While midstream, the young man attempted to jump into the Huangpu River to commit suicide. Fortunately, a deckhand noticed him and immediately pulled him back, handing him over to the dock police, who took him to the Public Security Bureau, District Three, for questioning. The young man identified himself as Dong Tingzai, nineteen years old, from Haimen, residing at No. 2 Chongde Lane, Zhao's Residence, Puxi. He had been an apprentice at the shop of his master, Ren Yaozan, for two and a half years. Last month, he had fallen deeply in love with a woman surnamed Gu, named Xiaying (seventeen years old), who lived nearby. However, their relationship was discovered by his master's uncle, Ren Yaoshui, who severely reprimanded him and sent a telegram to his master in Nanjing, fearing that he would be dismissed and unable to face his family, so he attempted suicide. Three suicide notes and a poem-like song describing his love affair (lengthy lyrics omitted) were found in his pocket. Director Zhang ordered that his master's uncle, Ren Yaoshui, be summoned to take him back and keep him under supervision.</p>
<p>Letter to his lover, Xiaying: Xiaying, I am now dead, and you must be pleased. I have always treated you as if you were no better than a prostitute, utterly heartless. Though my death is not worth regretting, your reputation is already half-gone. Now that I am dead, you are free to choose whatever you want. However, I am not dying from jealousy but from love. If you pity my suffering, please do not marry within three years or flirt with young men. I would die content. This is something you know in your heart, so I need not bother you further. But even in death, my heart does not die, so I leave these few words. If you obey, my soul will forever bow at your pomegranate skirt. Dong Tingzai's last words.</p>
<p>Letter to his father: Honorable Father, I respectfully report that I have neglected my studies due to infatuation with a woman, and it is entirely my fault. Now that the matter has been exposed, there is no way to remedy it. My master is unwilling to keep me, and I have no face to see you. My life is over, and I cannot repay your kindness in this life. In the next life, I will repay you as an ox or a horse. There is nothing more to say in this letter, so I bid you farewell forever. Please do not grieve, as if you had never had a son. Please always relieve your heart from sorrow. Respectfully, I wish you well. Your son, Dong Tingzai, kneeling in death.</p>
<p>Letter to my friend, Wenjie: My dear brother Wenjie, I bow my head to you. I am writing to apologize for my excessive indulgence in pleasure, which has led to my emotional downfall and burdened you. I am writing to you before my death to say goodbye. I hope you will advise young men to avoid going astray. As the saying goes, "The falling flowers have intentions, but the flowing water is heartless." My heart is extremely troubled. I will not bother you further. We will not meet in this life, but we will meet in the afterlife. With this, I wish you well. Your brother, Dong Tingzai, in his last letter.</p>

<p>Xu Debiao, a 21-year-old cart puller from Yancheng, borrowed two copper coins from his friend, surnamed Xie, at noon the other day while crossing the Suzhou Creek in front of the Yongyu Textile Factory. Xie only had those coins for his own use. The ferryman, Li Fugui, seeing that Xu had no money, ordered him to disembark. However, it was already late, and Xu was eager to get to the Ban Nan area to take over the cart. Disregarding the danger, Xu jumped into the water and grabbed onto the stern of the boat, pulling it towards the other bank. Li, enraged by this, raised his pole and threatened to strike Xu if he did not let go. Xu had no choice but to release the boat and try to swim to the other side but could not reach it and drowned. He called for help but was rescued by a nearby cargo ship, already lifeless. Xu's wife, Zhou, reported the incident to the water patrol, requesting an investigation. The police have detained Li for investigation.</p>

<p>Instruction from the Municipal Public Safety Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Safety Bureau issued the following instruction to all district stations and teams yesterday:</p>
<p>"It has come to our attention that the Bureau previously established a savings plan for patrol officers and sergeants to ensure their livelihood and security, allowing them to focus on their duties. With the approval of the Municipal Government, each district station and team was instructed to deduct a portion of their monthly salary and deposit it in a bank to accumulate interest. The Police Savings Regulations were also announced and implemented. However, the price of rice in the city has recently risen to unprecedented levels, significantly increasing the living expenses of these patrol officers and sergeants. To address these concerns, the Director of the Bureau has decided to temporarily suspend the savings plan from July 1st. Salaries will be paid in full, according to the original amount. The relevant department has been instructed to notify the managing bank to verify the amounts of all previous monthly deposits and promptly submit the passbooks to the Bureau for distribution to the respective commanding officers, who will then distribute them to the officers themselves. When rice prices return to normal, the situation will be reassessed, and the savings plan will be resumed. In addition to reporting this to the Mayor, all district station and team leaders are instructed to inform their subordinates to comply with this order."

<h3 id="e57">Former Qing Official Yu Shou Zhang Kidnapped and Rescued <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Wang Lansheng Turns Off the Engine</p>
<p>Kidnappers Flee in Panic</p>
<p>Around 8 PM yesterday evening, an incident involving four armed kidnappers occurred on Avenue Mengdelan, targeting Yu Shou Zhang, a former Qing official from Shaoxing, residing at No. 323 Weifeng Lane, Weihaiwei Road, Huxi. The inept kidnappers were unable to drive the car, allowing the hostage to escape. The following is an investigation report by our reporter:</p>
<p>The Hostage's Family: Yu Shou Zhang, also known as Zuotang, is a native of Shaoxing, Zhejiang, and is over forty years old. He is a former Qing official who retired long ago due to the decline of politics and now lives as a recluse in Shanghai. He used his savings from his official career to build a residence at No. 323 Weifeng Lane, Weihaiwei Road, Huxi, and owns a car with license plate number 1084. He lives a quiet life, rarely leaving his home and spending time with his family.</p>
<p>The "Three-Eight" Gathering: At 7:45 PM yesterday, Yu Shou Zhang was attending a "Three-Eight" dinner party, a tradition he started with a few close friends four or five years ago. The dinner is held on the 3rd and 8th days of the month, with each person taking turns to host and provide an opportunity for friends to talk and socialize. Yesterday, Yu's close friend, surnamed Zhang, was the host. Yu changed into a new outfit and instructed his driver, Wang Lansheng, to drive his car directly to Zhang's residence at No. 11 Avenue Mengdelan, intending to meet with Zhang and go to a restaurant for the dinner.</p>
<p>Sudden Kidnapping: After Yu Shou Zhang's car arrived at Zhang's residence, he chatted briefly with a friend before deciding to go out for dinner. He instructed his driver to drive the car out, accompanied by a servant surnamed Xu. As the car exited the lane, four men in short clothing, two of whom were wielding handguns, blocked Yu's path, telling him not to make a sound, or he would be killed. The other two men pointed their guns at the driver, Wang Lansheng, and the servant, Xu, ordering them to stop the engine and get out of the car.</p>
<p>The Driver's Clever Plan: Wang Lansheng, recognizing the danger posed by the armed kidnappers, knew that resistance could be fatal. In a moment of quick thinking, he turned off the engine. Wang Lansheng and the servant, Xu, calmly exited the car and stood by the road. The kidnappers then forced Yu Shou Zhang into the car, holding guns to his waist. Yu was stunned and unable to move. Two other kidnappers sat in the driver's seat, intending to start the engine and drive away at full speed.</p>
<p>Kidnappers Escape: However, the kidnappers were unable to start the car despite repeated attempts. The engine remained stubbornly unresponsive. The driver, Wang Lansheng, saw that the kidnappers were unable to drive the car. To rescue his master, he immediately began blowing the car horn and shouting "Kidnapping!" Hearing the commotion, nearby police officers and detectives rushed to the scene. Seeing that the situation was dire, the kidnappers abandoned their plan to kidnap the "God of Wealth" and fled the scene. Fortunately, no shots were fired, and Yu Shou Zhang escaped unharmed.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education has approved a request from the Training Supervision Department to temporarily postpone the three-week continuous military training for high schools and above, originally scheduled for the summer. In addition to instructing universities and vocational schools, the Ministry has also issued a circular to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, stating:</p>
<p>"In response to the Training Supervision Department's request, [based on reports from the Ministry's representatives in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces, citing various difficulties expressed by the administrators of high schools and above regarding the three-week continuous strict military training stipulated in the military education plan during the summer vacation, we respectfully request that you consider amending the three-week military training to be implemented during the summer vacation of the current year]. As there are indeed obstacles to conducting the training this summer, we agree to temporarily postpone it. In addition to instructing all military instructors to comply, we are also issuing a circular for your review and for distribution to all schools." Therefore, all public and private high schools and higher institutions are instructed to comply with this order.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education has defined the medical study procedures and has issued a notice stating: "Medical education is of utmost importance, and the study procedures should be clarified and adhered to. The Ministry has therefore stipulated that students applying to university medical colleges must have completed high school. They must then complete a two-year pre-medical program before entering the five-year undergraduate program. These pre-medical programs will be administered by the university's science college. Independent medical colleges or those facing special circumstances (such as universities without a science college or where the science and medical colleges are far apart) may request that another university's science college administer the pre-medical program. In unavoidable circumstances, the college may establish its own pre-medical program. All university medical colleges and independent medical colleges must comply with these regulations."</p>

<p>Yesterday, the 28th, Zhenhua Girls' School in Suzhou held its graduation ceremony. At 9 AM, despite the humid heat, guests arrived, including leaders and representatives from various institutions and schools, school directors Zhang Zhongren, Zhang Yunbo, Liu Beimu, Bei Zaian, Xu Boming, and prominent figures from the education sector, such as Yang Xingfo. After the customary opening remarks, the school directors and principal presented their reports. Yang Xingfo gave a speech titled "The Psychology that Chinese Women Should Transform." He emphasized (1) focusing on revolutionary work as individuals, rather than being confined to the traditional concept of "virtuous wife and good mother"; (2) expanding the concept of aesthetics to include endeavors in art, hygiene, science, and literature; (3) extending their influence to the entire society and community; and (4) applying scientific methods to improve women's lives. His words were extremely insightful. Afterwards, the Party representative, Yang Zu, delivered a closing speech, praising the school as the cultural center of Suzhou. The county government representative and Director of Education of Wu County, Wu Guanghan, also gave speeches. Director Wu stated that the county's annual education budget was 500,000 yuan, but there was a lack of girls' middle schools. The school filled a significant gap in society. The principal of the girls' middle school, Chen She, the vocational school principal, Pan Jianqing, and Zhang Yunbo and Xu Boming also gave speeches. The head of the school, Shen Jiying, gave a farewell speech, encouraging the students to embrace the qualities of "action," "tranquility," "responsibility," and "detachment." The ceremony concluded with the presentation of awards and music.</p>

<h3 id="e66">City Education Bureau Thoroughly Investigates Extortion of Graduation Certificate Fees <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>According to regulations, graduation certificates for primary and secondary schools in the city must be purchased from the City Education Bureau. Each certificate costs only one dime (yuan) for printing fees. Secondary school certificates also require a three-dime stamp, while primary school certificates are exempt. This procedure is intended to standardize certificates. However, it has recently been reported that some school authorities are privately demanding certificate fees ranging from two to four yuan from graduates, threatening to withhold the certificates if the fee is not paid. The City Education Bureau considers such behavior to be extortion and has dispatched personnel to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>

However, due to the large number of exhibits and the time required for judging, the judging will not be completed until June 30th. Therefore, the date for schools to retrieve their exhibits has been rescheduled to start on July 1st.</p>

<h3 id="e70">St. John's 51st Graduation Ceremony <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>St. John's University held its 51st graduation ceremony yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. After the ceremony, President Bu delivered the opening remarks. Acting Academic Dean Zhao Xiuhong gave a report, stating that it was a great honor and pleasure to welcome the guests to the 51st graduation ceremony. He then briefly reported on the events of the academic year. The biggest event of the academic year was the celebration of the school's 50th anniversary in mid-December last year, along with the opening ceremony of the student activity center. Today's graduation ceremony is being held in this auditorium for the first time. This year, there are 573 university and high school students, a significant increase from last year. The number of faculty members is the same as in previous years, with the exception of the unfortunate passing of French teacher Ms. Lambert. Ms. Lambert had taught at the school for many years, and her passing is deeply mourned. This year, two professors were sent to the school by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, one being Dr. Martin, a professor of political science at the University of Washington in Seattle, who lectured on [Modern Political Trends] in mid-December last year, and the other being Dr. Teqiu, a history professor at Whistling University in Natic Province, who lectured on [The Foundation of International Order] in March. The medical school is thriving this year, with 24 students in the first year, the largest number in its history. There are also 13 students planning to enter the medical school in the second half of the year. China desperately needs highly trained doctors, but the medical school's expenses are very high. The school has received donations from the American Board of Trustees and other sources, allowing it to continue operating. In May, Mr. Hua Chi, the director-general sent by the school's founder, came to China to investigate the problems that church schools need to solve. During this academic year, Academic Dean and Acting Vice President Shen Siliang traveled to the United States and will return to the school in the second half of the year. After the school was temporarily suspended in 1927, there were very few senior students in the College of Arts and Sciences. Today, 43 high school students, 24 students from the College of Arts and Sciences, 1 graduate student, and 14 medical students are graduating. One special thing about the graduates is that there is a chef who also earned a Bachelor of Arts degree, the first person in China to do so. Cao Yunxiang delivered a speech on [The Benefits and Responsibilities of Great Universities].</p>

<h3 id="e74">The Photoreproduction of the Hundred Naps Edition of the Twenty-Four Histories <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Twenty-Four Histories is a must-read for studying history. The current popular edition is the Qianlong Wuying Palace edition of the Qing Dynasty. It is said that after the Commercial Press printed the Sibu Congkan in 1920, it had a proposal to reprint the ancient edition of the Twenty-Four Histories. After ten years of accumulation, it has finally gathered momentum, and sample prints have been released for sale and pre-ordering. Anyone who has seen the samples says that the synthesis of the whole book has several advantages: First, it is a great achievement to compile and combine old editions. Old editions from the Song and Yuan dynasties are rare and hard to find. In the past, public and private collectors could obtain several types of editions, which were already treasures. Now, the library has not only released all the collections of the Hanfen Tower, but also sought out more than ten types of Song and Yuan editions collected by collectors at home and abroad, which are extensive and rich, and can be called unprecedented. This example is also for the purpose of purchase and collection. Second, it is to correct the omissions of the Palace edition. The Wuying engraved edition is actually full of flaws, and there is no detailed explanation of it in the past. That is, the Ming Southern Supervision edition and the Jigu Pavilion edition, which are valued by the world, are not completely based on the original engraving of the Song and Yuan Dynasties. Now, according to the good edition obtained, all the missing texts, wrong characters, duplicate pages, blank spaces, etc. of the Palace edition can be corrected. This is convenient for collation. Third, the printing of the whole book is exquisite. The Commercial Press's printing technology is exquisite. The previous prints of the Hundred Naps Records of the Grand Historian and the Naps Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, etc., are not inferior to the original engraving. The reproduced books can obtain the true face and are far better than the reproduced and engraved versions. As for the school according to, it is said that it is more prudent, and there is no need to sweep the leaves to prevent the disadvantages of arbitrarily changing it. This book is a treasure book that must be purchased by public and private libraries and book collectors, and it is especially suitable for those who already have the Palace edition of the Twenty-Four Histories to be equipped with it for review.</p>

<p>The German Harmony School on Bin Road in the Public Concession of the city was expanded into a two-level primary school this spring, accommodating nearly two hundred students, most of whom are poor children. Therefore, the school's finances are still not adequate. During the summer vacation, a Japanese language specialization department has been opened for secondary school students and above to specialize in Japanese language. The teachers have studied in Japan for more than ten years and have rich educational experience. It is planned to use the tuition fees collected to subsidize the German Harmony School. The number of applicants has been very enthusiastic in recent days, and it is also heard that a primary school tutoring class will be opened at the same time, divided into day and night classes.</p>

<p>The more intelligent a person is, the less opinion they have. Therefore, they have more unsatisfactory things than stupid people.</p>
<p>The struggle in the realm of love is like a warlord's chaos, there will always be a day of victory or bloodshed.</p>
<p>The many students are the future masters of the country, and their importance is no less than that of flowers and rice, which are related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, but the government's heart to cultivate students should be as deep as the farmer's heart to love and protect flowers and rice.</p>
<p>If you stain a little ink on your clothes, you will be eager to wash the bar. If you secretly do an evil thing, you will be happy and contented, so the human heart is unpredictable and the world is rugged.</p>
<p>If you don't know the price of rice, you don't know thrift. If you don't know the shame of national humiliation, you don't know self-strengthening. The effect of passive excitement is also conceivable.</p>
<p>When young people are studying, they all want to make a great career in the future. By the time they leave school, they are either warlords who lose power and humiliate the country, or officials who plunder the land, or treacherous merchants who act as accomplices for tigers, or thieves who transport rice for export. Half of them are indeed because of economic coercion, and half of them are still confused by the inducement of a bad environment.</p>
<p>The benevolent family only knows how to seek life, but does not know how to pay attention to hygiene, so every summer there are rescues that cannot be saved, and they are exhausted from running around.</p>
<p>If you entertain guests in the summer, it is well-intentioned, but it may turn into ill will, because they disturb you with a lot of Dongli things that are easy to get sick, so it is best to avoid banquets in the summer.</p>
<p>If a person wants to avoid the invasion of disease demons in the summer, he only needs not to be too cool when sleeping, avoid raw and cold food when eating, and refuse all kinds of banquets, and that's it.</p>
<h3 id="e80">On the Nanzhang, Jin and Xuan, the Origin of Revolutionary Strategies <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Nanzhang is the hometown of Sun Yat-sen, the mentor of the Chinese Revolution, located forty li away from the county seat in the Fourth and Da Du [collectively known as the Four Da and Two Du]. It is also known as Nanzhang Market because there is a town called Nanzhang Market in that area, hence the name. When people ask about the hometown of the locals, they don't say a certain village in the Fourth or Da Du, but always answer Nanzhang, which is the custom. There are more than thirty villages with a population of about 40,000. The people are kind and good, and it is the first village in the county. Many people go out to make a living and are considered rich and prosperous. Since the revolution, there have been many people from this area who have worked for the party and the country. In addition to Sun Yat-sen and his son from Cuikeng, there is Mr. Lu Haodong, who died in Guangzhou and was from the same village as Sun Yat-sen, President Cheng Yutang from Anding, Minister Li Luchao from Qishan, and Commander Ouyang Ju from Mazi, all of whom have attracted national attention. The revolutionary figures in Nanzhang did not begin with Sun Yat-sen, but there were two people before him, one was Tan Shaoguang from Yakou and the other was Liang Zizhi from Longxuetou. Anyone who reads the history of the Taiping Rebellion knows Tan Shaoguang, but very few people in the county know about Liang Zizhi, and he is almost forgotten. Zizhi was a poor Confucian scholar who taught in the countryside to make a living. After the failure of the Taiping Rebellion, Zizhi was angry at the Manchus' wanton killing and saddened by the Han traitors' lack of patriotism. So he secretly gathered the villagers and wanted to attack Gong County. However, there was no opportunity. There was a tradition in the village that during the Dragon Boat Festival, there would be a parade in the city. The local custom was to welcome the gods and hold parades on the Dragon Boat Festival, either day or night, which was the most lively festival of the year. Zizhi then conspired with the villagers to hide weapons in giant bamboo, and entered the city one day in advance, pretending to be needed for holding fire, wanting to attack without warning. Unfortunately, the plan was revealed and Zizhi was martyred. Therefore, people in the city now have the saying [Old villagers dragging green bamboo] to ridicule the villagers, but they do not know that this saying is a memorial to the national spirit of the villagers. In the old days of autocracy, people mostly did not dare to talk about Zizhi's anecdotes. Although the two did not achieve great success, after more than two hundred years, the foreign emperors were finally overthrown by Sun Yat-sen. If they have knowledge in the afterlife, they should also be proud. Who knows but that the one who destroys Qin is not Chu? Nanzhang is truly worthy of being the source of revolutionary strategies.

<p>Textual Research on Xianshan · Yang · One · Xiao</p>
<p>The martyr Chen Yingshi was buried in Xianshan outside the South Gate of Huzhou. However, Xianshan is not only found in Huzhou. It has been researched that there is also Xianshan in Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei. In the past, Yang You loved mountains and rivers. Every time there was a beautiful scenery, he would go to Xianshan to set up wine and talk forever. He sighed with emotion and said to Zou Zhan and others, "Since the universe existed, there has been this mountain. Since then, there have been many virtuous scholars who have climbed this mountain and looked into the distance, like me and you. They have all been submerged and unheard of, making people sad. If I have knowledge after a hundred years, my ghost will still climb this mountain." Zhan said, "Your fame and reputation will surely be passed on along with this mountain." After You died, the people of Xiangyang built a monument and temple on Xianshan. Those who looked at the monument could not help but shed tears. Du Yu named it the "Tear-Dropping Monument," which is also a famous place.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Mosihu Lake <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Spring Tide</p>
<p>Mosihu Lake is located outside the Shuixi Gate of the capital, and it is said to be the best of the forty-eight scenic spots in Beijing. I recently visited and felt that although its scenery is simple and beautiful, it is not as broad and beautiful as Xuanwu Lake. When the setting sun is infinitely good in the evening, sitting here and having a clear conversation while holding tea is also a joy in life.</p>
<p>The temple in charge of this lake is called Huayan Temple, and its multi-storied pavilions and buildings are quite good. The center is the Yu Jintang and the top is the Shengqi Building. According to old history, Xu Da and the Ming Taizu once gambled here. Da won, and the Taizu gave him this lake. After Da's death, the lake's production still belonged to Xu's descendants for hundreds of years. Recently, it was heard that the Beijing Municipal Government has already requisitioned it for public ownership. The monks of Huayan Temple were all driven away, and more than 10,000 yuan was given to Xu's descendants as compensation and reorganized into Mosihu Lake Park. The Education Bureau and the Finance Bureau each sent a staff member to be stationed here to manage everything. Therefore, the lake has been quite bureaucratic recently.</p>
<p>From the side door of Yu Jintang, a winding path leads to the Zeng Gong Pavilion. The view of the lake here is the most refreshing, making people feel broad-minded. That day, I was with Qin Wang and other gentlemen, and we sat here to drink tea. At that time, the twilight was slightly shrouded, and the setting sun had disappeared behind the mountains. The scenery on the lake was all faded. The opposite Qingliang Mountain could still be seen clearly, and the city walls were like a belt, which was extremely beautiful. We talked and laughed, pointing and pointing, until all the other guests had left before we left. It was already seven o'clock when we looked at the watch.</p>
<p>I heard that the scenery of watching lotus flowers in Mochou Lake is the most beautiful. We went to visit, but it was not the right time, which made us feel quite regretful. At the same time, I felt that this is a waterside view, but one cannot boat. As Xuanwu Lake can be rowed in the middle of the stream, its ability to attract tourists is slightly inferior. However, the buildings on the lake have the flavor of West Lake villas, and there are many couplets, many of which are excellent. I only remembered that a certain gentleman's couplet said: People call Mochou Lake, call Mochou. There are originally many things to worry about in the world. Wang Ding has an image, and it should be like him. There are not many people in the eyes who are like this. I feel that it is quite clever and can be recited.</p>
<p>Adjacent to Mochou Lake is the Yue Army Cemetery, which was for those who sacrificed in the founding of the Republic of China. Mr. Zhongzhi personally wrote an inscription, "Establish the Country and Become Benevolent." There are two giant steles next to it, which seem to be tomb inscriptions written by Tan Zu'an and Wang Jingwei. The characters have been blurred and cannot be recognized. During the era of warlord autocracy, the local officials did not pay attention to this tomb, so the dilapidated walls and weeds were full of it. Since the revolutionary army recovered the capital, it has been slightly renovated, a new pavilion has been built, and a stone railing has been added in front of the stele road. However, as no one is in charge, it still feels desolate.</p>
<p>Based on my experience of traveling around the famous scenic spots in Beijing, the top of Qingliang Mountain is suitable for overlooking the entire view of Beijing, Linggu Temple is suitable for holding a picnic, Xuanwu Lake is suitable for boating on a moonlit night, and Mochou Lake is suitable for watching the rain in the autumn morning. I don't know if there are any tourists in Beijing who feel the same way as me.</p>
<p>Travel Notes in Nanyang (39) Linghua</p>
<p>However, the difficulty in resolving the male-female system is the same as the economic problem highly advocated by Marx. A Jin person once told me that there is a folk saying in my place that people in Jiangnan first engrave their original examination papers after passing the imperial examination, and people in Shanxi first marry a concubine after passing the imperial examination. From this, it can be seen that the customs in China, regardless of wealth or status, men never fail to indulge their sexual desires once they achieve success. At the same time, they still use the morality of "three obediences and four virtues" to restrain their wives and concubines. It is incomprehensible that all morality and shame are only set for women. However, the difficulty in resolving the sex problem is equal to the economic problem. The West does not use the concubine system, but replaces it with free divorce, and recently even replaces it with free love. In fact, the changes are even greater, but they are more equal than in the East. My Buddha then established a monastic system, which is too high and difficult to practice. Many practitioners fail, and Buddhism in China is in line with Confucianism's polygamy system. Buddhism in Qinghai and Tibet is also in line with the Tibetan custom of polyandry. Then, Buddhism in the West must also be in line with the free love of the lover system. Great is my Buddhist door, how can it be confined to one pattern? In the future, will the one who can liberate everything be the joyous Buddhist system of Mongolia?</p>
<p>However, I know that Mr. Xiong Changqing's family organization is not like the polygamy system of ordinary capitalists, who use women to provide for their entertainment. Mr. Xiong originally wanted to run a girls' school, but people added rumors to it. He then had a whimsical idea to widely recruit female guests to teach them. The system is that those who enter his Fuyuan, in addition to food and lodging, receive eight yuan per month for all expenses. It is stipulated that those who wish to leave can leave at any time. If they meet on the road in the future, they can only call Mr. Xiong. But those who have left do not have to come again. I once went to his Fuyuan and saw the situation of practicing arts in classes, and I knew that Xiong was a strange person who was curious and used the method of Lord Mengchang to support guests to adopt many poor girls and teach them technology. His female guests rarely decorate themselves and are all simple and accustomed to things. Mr. Xiong is probably a female Mengchang who is hospitable. Now, the male Mengchang raises thousands of warriors who go out and kill people, and no one dares to criticize it. The female Mengchang raises female guests to practice arts, but people criticize it. Is it not unfair? Xiong sent me two lines of poetry, saying, "Please see the Jingwei River in Fuyuan, which does not invade each other." This can reveal his ambition.</p>
<p>On the eighth day, I discussed poetry with the poets of the Tanxie Poetry Society, and there were also monks who were able to write poetry. The literary style overseas is also quite elegant. The most prominent literary celebrity here is Qiu Shuyuan, who has written many works. He is a chivalrous and hospitable person. During the Wuxu Reform, he entertained the new party and spent a lot of money. He is still a literary star overseas. It is a pity that he is old and sick and cannot go out. Qiu's selection of the manuscripts of the Tanxie Poetry Society shows that Qiu has studied both the Han and Song schools and admires Yuan Zicai very much when discussing poetry. His daughter, named Mingquan, is famous for her art. Her husband, Wang Laisu, graduated from Peking University. I hope he can promote Mr. Qiu's literary style. Qiu also understands Buddhism and once edited the Lion's Roar newspaper. It is a pity that Qiu is sick and there is no successor. The Buddhist light of Nanyang culture has greatly faded.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Trivial Talk on Waxberries <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Xiao Chang</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "The waxberries are red all over the mountains at the summer solstice." It is now the time of the summer solstice, so waxberries are on the market again.</p>
<p>The most famous area for waxberries in Zhejiang is Tanglou in western Zhejiang and Zhuji in eastern Zhejiang. Other places such as Yuyao and Xiaoshan also produce this fruit, but the production is far less than that of Tanglou and Zhuji, and the quality is not as good.</p>
<p>The quality of waxberries in Tanglou and Zhuji is different, and the taste is also different. The waxberries produced in Tangqi are mostly charcoal waxberries, which are large in size, thick in grain, small in pit, and have a lot of juice. The taste is extremely sweet and is indeed a good product. The waxberries produced in Zhuji are small in size, have small stems, fine grains, thick pits, and less juice, but the taste is fresh, which is not as good as the waxberries produced in Tangqi. However, the ripening period is later and can only be harvested after the Tangqi products have been on the market. When the waxberries are ripe on the branches, they are very beautiful to look at. The green leaves and red fruits look like colorful sedan chairs.</p>
<p>When the waxberries in Tangqi are ripe on the branches, pedestrians can eat them at will. The owner of the food sees it and does not prohibit it, but when eating, they must not pick them off with their hands. They must eat them directly from the branches with their mouths. If they are picked off with their hands, they will be regarded as stealing. The surface of the waxberries has awns, and after picking them, they must be lightly rubbed with the palm to remove the awns before they can be eaten in large quantities, otherwise, if you eat several of them, the palate and tongue in the mouth will be injured by the awns.</p>
<p>Waxberry pits have the effect of eliminating hair in our stomachs, so those who eat waxberries must swallow several pits every year. And the people in the southern countryside of Wukang swallow all the pits they eat, no matter how many they eat. This is another anecdote about eating waxberries.</p>
<p>The publishing industry news is always known for its vividness, and the Saturday newspaper is becoming more and more exciting. It has now been published to issue 363. The second collection has been released for sale, and the binding and paper are very exquisite. The printing is especially fresh and original. There are a total of more than 340 sensual copperplate illustrations. It is said to sell for only one yuan and two jiao.</p>

<p>Chapter 12: Farewell Banquet and Departure, Plucking Flowers to Keep a Beautiful Shadow, Grand Gathering in a Famous Garden, Tea Tasting to See the Beautiful Appearance</p>
<p>Ruiyun had a face like the red glow of the setting sun, and a pair of eyes sparkling like the stars in the sky. It was a pity that although she had the freshness of the rising sun, she was numbed because her profession was a prostitute. Even if the seeds of love occasionally sprouted in her emotional field, they could not grow out. As the ancients said, [It is not that there are no sprouts, but the cattle and sheep graze on them.] Therefore, her concept was to listen to people's arrangements and be content with the situation. Moreover, she was a sacrifice that was bought. She was a person who was called a "pleaser" in the brothel and had no power to resist. She was almost not allowed to complain, just like a news reporter under strict censorship. Although she was full of complaints, she could not publish a sentence. Therefore, her body and spirit had to be controlled by others. That night, one stick of incense and one meal of big dishes lasted until half past eleven. The three mouths of the three people were really too busy. Today, it was like working overtime, eating and chatting. Ruiyun originally wanted to ask Zuo Shichen to go take pictures together tomorrow afternoon. Zuo Shichen said, "You go with A Jin. After you take the pictures, give me the receipt for picking up the photos, and I will pick them up myself." After the meal, they went their separate ways. Tomorrow night, Zuo Shichen sent a small gift. The person who came back said that the person was no longer in business and brought back a photo receipt. This case seemed to be over. However, A Jin said that the meaning of the old madam was that Ruiyun's business would definitely decline after she got married. Could you please help the second young master? The current Han Yun is not very good. She can't even sing in the front row. It would be good if she could sing in the second row. Zuo Shichen agreed casually. She wanted to pass on this business forever. Suddenly, a festival passed, and suddenly seven or eight days passed. At that time, many people in the brothel officially announced that they were getting married. What was previously hidden can now be officially announced. Many suspected rumors that someone was getting married have now been confirmed. People who were creating an atmosphere are still running their business, and the rumors are not denied but are self-evident. To prove that she is married, you only need to go to the newspaper with a urging flower charm and say that so-and-so's sign is gone, or the sign is still there, but the person who is called has changed into a beautiful posture. Although it is not that the phoenix has left and the building is empty, things are no longer the same. So, it is as if a new dynasty has been replaced, and a new group of people has taken the stage to replace the group of people who have married. Among these new people, there must be a group of outstanding people, beautiful women, who are called the rising stars. From ancient times to the present, which society is not like this? From the vast sky to the small flower or leaf, why is the brothel society alone different?</p>

<h3 id="e83">The Financial Gold Market is Getting Worse <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The total drop in the last three days was thirty-seven taels</p>
<p>The floating gains outside of six hundred taels were greatly affected</p>
<p>The long foreign exchange was loose and the gold price plummeted. Yesterday's gold auction had an alarming change. The rampant decline was indescribable. The turmoil was fierce, but there were always four or five taels of hidden risks. People were extremely fearful and suddenly plummeted by more than twenty taels. This was really affected by the easing of foreign exchange. Although the banks were taking in, they were not diligent. In particular, the major firms such as Yuan Xingyong, Yuansheng, Jin Dayong, etc. were very eager to sell. Those with floating gains outside of six hundred taels were greatly affected. Moreover, the bank closure was approaching, and each firm was eager to sell, so the market atmosphere suddenly became weak and suddenly broke through the 580 tael mark. The high and low prices in half a day actually differed by more than twenty-eight taels, which was rare. Although the major firms were long in the morning, buyers were active in the market. Fuchang, Yuan Maoyong, Zhifengyong, etc. all had purchases, so the opening price returned high. Then it jumped to more than 604 taels, but the flowers flashed and went in the opposite direction. Foreign exchange also listed a long order. Major firms eagerly sold off and plummeted. The decline was rapid and fell tragically by more than twenty taels, suddenly within 580 taels. Until noon, it suddenly turned flat and jumped up seven or eight taels, and then the buyers slightly saw a stop. Finally, it stood between 584 taels. However, the industry was still in a fog. How could there be such a big change in the evening?</p>
<p>The first order revealed a high opening and a flash. Yesterday, the Bank of England released a long of sixteen and seven points. The US silver added one-half. The exchange rate did not move. The opening price of gold in August immediately added three taels and one qian. Then it continued to increase by four or five taels. The foreign exchange was still flat. Guangbang and others settled for six pence and two five for September British gold. The China Banking Corporation mutually did US$36.9375, so when the first order was revealed, it rose to 604 taels and five qian. However, the listing price had already added two five US$0.375. The Japanese gold decreased by two points and each firm sold it vigorously. In addition, the internal transfer of the draft was declining, so the situation got worse and worse, and the price plummeted by more than twenty taels. At half past ten, it was 84 taels and a half. Afterwards, it was raised again by more than four taels, but it was bought by four or five taels of Qipu Zhuyou and Shanghai. The September British gold was six pence and six two five, and the October one was seven five.</p>
<p>Drafts were loose and broke through the 80 tael mark. After 11 o'clock, the decline was even more severe. Xiangyu, Yuan Xingyong, and each firm bravely sold off. The recent bank buying price of Japanese gold was only one tael, three qian, one fen. The September British gold was difficult to sell even at six pence and six eight seven five, so the gold price continued to fall crazily by twelve or thirteen taels and suddenly broke through the 80 tael mark. At half past eleven, it suddenly entered 76 taels. Afterwards, there was a slight replenishment of the head position on the table. The banks once absorbed the September British gold at six pence and six eight seven five and suddenly jumped up by more than eight taels. At noon closing, it was 584 taels and five qian, which was 11 taels and seven qian lower than the day before. In the last three days, the total drop was more than 37 taels.</p>

<p>Major firms were eager to sell. Each broker's transaction was very sensitive and quick. However, the major firms were selling off and the multi-party's spirit was greatly reduced. Fuchang, Zhifengyong, Xiangyu, Dadecheng, etc. all entered and exited early. Yuan Maoyong, Shunli, Tongtaichang, etc. entered slightly. Wanxing Hengxing, Yu Da, Yuantai, etc. entered and exited from time to time. Yuan Xingyong, Jin'an, Yuancheng Yong, Jin Dayong, Yuancheng, Xieyu, Fuyu and other major firms tended to sell off. The rest of the firms entered and exited suddenly and were confused. The Dalian Gang had a total of more than 2,000 transactions, which were generally even. The Guangbang exited and re-entered, totaling more than 1,000 transactions, which were generally even.</p>

<p>The listed price is long again</p>
<p>The internal disk trading is very clear</p>

The situation was chaotic because the gold auction was very turbulent and there were more than twenty-eight taels of difference. Suddenly, it broke through the 580 tael mark and fell madly by more than twenty taels, which was shocking. Chinese speculators all threw out, but they had made some settlements at the beginning. It was estimated that more than 200,000 pounds of British gold had been traded and more than 100,000 had been sold. Banks such as Shanghai, Holland, Jiaoda, Zhuyou, Zhengjin, etc. all had intakes. However, the British banks did not have a healthy appetite and Zhuyou and others sold slightly. However, Guangbang Shen Da, etc. settled in. Also, each bank did tens of thousands of pounds and also did 100,000 US dollars. However, the transaction of Japanese gold was rare. Only Dalian was seen to have sold tens of thousands of yuan, which were bought by Sanjing and Korea. At the noon closing, each exchange was better than the previous day. It was estimated that the first order was long at 1875, the US dollar was long at 5625, and the Japanese gold decreased by one and a half fen.

<p>The Past and Future of Our School by Xu Renhan and Gong Bing</p>
<p>Our school, in the spring of the 14th year of the Republic of China, leased five buildings in Runde Lane, Moore Road, Shanghai Public Concession, and set up a preparatory office at No. 18, Taixing Lane, nearby. In the summer of the same year, we moved into the school building and named it Minzhi Public School, opening a summer school with six teachers and three students, teaching diligently. In the autumn semester, school board members Ma Chonggan, Cai Xingsu, female poet Chen Jiaqing, Fudan University Bachelor of Science Zhang Tianjun, Jiangsu Provincial Second Normal School graduate Ding Zhuangru, Xu Xiongwan, Second Women's Normal School graduate Bao Huishu, Yanshi Girls' School graduate Sun Jie, and other teachers were hired to teach in elementary and middle schools. In that year, the number of elementary, middle, and kindergarten students increased from 33 to 75. In the spring of the 15th year, a library was added. In January of the 16th year, a publishing department was established to publish Chinese language achievements and the first issue of the school journal. In the autumn of the 17th year, due to the increase of students to 328, the school building was insufficient, so we moved to Weifeng Lane, Weihaiwei Road. In September of the same year, due to the accumulation of winning manuscripts from previous Shanghai speech competitions, we published a collection of speeches for our comrades. On January 17th of the 18th year, we were approved and registered by the Shanghai Special City Education Bureau. In the summer of the same year, we were ordered to change our name to Minzhi Elementary and Middle School. In the autumn of the same year, the number of students increased to 412, and the school building was again insufficient, so we leased a Western-style building at No. 121 on the same road to create a second campus. In the spring of the 19th year, the Western-style building at No. 105 adjacent to the second campus happened to be available for rent, which could accommodate four or five hundred people, so we gave up the Weifeng Lane building and rented this one instead. By this point, the school building was slightly more spacious and suitable, and both teachers and students felt more convenient for teaching and learning. This year, we added a women's department, an adult class, a people's school, and a sports field. The number of faculty and staff increased to 26, and the student body increased to 558. The organization was divided into two kindergarten levels, twelve elementary school levels for boys and girls, two junior high school levels, one adult level, and two people's school levels, for a total of 19 classes, forming a rough scale. For the past five years, we have worked tirelessly throughout the year, actively engaging in publishing, speeches, libraries, physical education, hygiene, and other activities that are beneficial to the physical and mental well-being of children and youth, striving to achieve the goal of establishing a successful Chinese-run education in the concession. This is a brief history of our school's past five years, which can be reported to our fellow countrymen and gentlemen. However, as the number of students increases daily, according to our school's three-year plan, we plan to increase the kindergarten to four levels, the elementary school to 24 levels for boys and girls in the spring and autumn semesters, the middle school to six levels, the adult supplementary class to two levels, the people's school to six levels, and to add two levels of commercial supplementary classes, for a total of 44 levels. Based on the past increase in the proportion of students and the current surge in the population of the western district, it is indeed possible to achieve this. However, since our school does not have its own school building, it is feared that it will be difficult to improve internally and develop each year for a long time to come. The colleagues have been thinking about the many students who have been together day and night for five years, and there is no shortage of talented and hardworking people. If there is no well-equipped school building to make great achievements and attract more students, it is not a great plan to reserve talents for the country and recover the right to education. However, purchasing land and constructing buildings requires a huge amount of money, and the wish is grand but the strength is weak, so we are hesitant. We hope that our school's alumni, students' families, and enthusiastic educators at home and abroad will provide support so that we can see success as soon as possible. Now that our school is compiling and printing a special issue for the fifth anniversary, we respectfully present the school history to our fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>Eulogy (Wang Boqun)</p>
<p>There is no greater joy in the world than holding the power of education, especially when a school is created from scratch, from elementary school to middle school, from dozens of students to hundreds, and from hundreds to almost a thousand. They come with books and leave after graduation, going on to further education or serving society. Like planting a forest, I see it becoming a shade; like planting good grain, I see it yielding a rich harvest. What joy is there! However, the care, cultivation, and protection from the wind, rain, cold, and heat have also been laborious. As the saying goes, "First hardship, then gain." Benevolent people use this to cultivate new knowledge.</p>
<p>I know Mr. Xu Renhan, the founder of Shanghai Minzhi Middle School, and I rejoice in his tireless efforts and remarkable achievements. Signed Wang Chonghui.</p>

<p>Half the work is done with diligence, five years have passed, planting trees and cultivating people. I remember the talented Xu Shu and the erudite Gong She, who invested in establishing the school with the same enthusiasm. We have exhausted the offerings of celery and algae, and created elites. We aim to enlighten the wisdom of new citizens. The light of time has changed, and the initial foundation has been nourished by virtue. The past events have become dust. I have heard of the shaping of talents, and the excellent speeches have been compiled into a collection. I imagine the flourishing of talents in those years, and the generous awards filled the doors with peach and plum trees. The timely rain is evenly distributed, and the famous compilation is shining brightly. The tall buildings are magnificent, and the auspicious atmosphere is lush and vibrant with five-colored clouds. What now? We praise the renewal of building houses and spreading the torch of knowledge.</p>

<p>Investigating Principles and Achieving Practicality by Jiang Lin</p>
<p>Preface (Cheng Tianfang)</p>
<p>Shanghai Minzhi Public School, after being painstakingly managed by its leaders, has now been established for five years. Mr. Gong Bingruo, the founder of our school.</p>
<p>Hammering and shaping talents, holding a mirror and judging people Yi Yang Shuzhuang</p>
<p>Furthermore, saving the country. Recently, a memorial album was published, and I was asked to write a preface. After reading the school history, I was moved by it! There are many people talking about education today, but most of them cannot avoid the drawbacks of aiming too high and being unrealistic. When mentioning education, they must take pride in establishing a university, or at least believe that efforts should be focused on the development of secondary education. They never consider that elementary education is the foundation of all education.</p>
<p>Inscription by Wu</p>
<p>If the foundation is not solid, it is like building a house on a sandy beach. No matter how magnificent and beautiful it may be, it will collapse immediately after a storm. The lack of success in education today is due to this reason. Minzhi does not have a university or specialized department. School board member Jiang Wenyu</p>
<p>Even a part of secondary school is just beginning to be established. However, the four words "Minzhi Public School" leave a deep impression in the minds of people who have lived in Shanghai for a long time. Why is this the case? It is because of the achievements of elementary education. Now, Minzhi is expanding secondary education on the basis of a solid elementary education. The future development is immeasurable. The perseverance and enthusiasm of the person in charge are unquestionable. What is especially admirable is his ability to set an example for the people of the country by working hard at the grassroots level. I respectfully write a few words as a preface.</p>
<p>Fifth Anniversary of Minzhi Middle School</p>
<p>Developing Wisdom and Storing Talent by Kong Xiangxi</p>
<p>Preface (Wei Ke)</p>
<p>Minzhi Middle School is about to compile and print a fifth anniversary album and asked me to write a preface. I believe that [Minzhi] is one of the few private schools in western Shanghai with remarkable achievements and has long been trusted by the people of western Shanghai. Looking back at the establishment of [Minzhi], it has only been five years, but its rapid development can be described as a thousand miles a day. The future progress is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Although schools are divided into public and private in terms of finance and management, the purpose of education is the same. There are many school-age children in the Shanghai Concession, but the schools run by the工部局 are few, and there are not many municipal schools either. The only reliance for meeting the educational needs of the concession is private schools. Therefore, private schools bear the most important educational responsibility in the Shanghai Concession.</p>
<p>Education is the foundation of a country. Now that our country is building a nation based on the Three Principles of the People, the purpose of education should naturally be based on the Three Principles of the People. At the moment, the call for the recovery of educational buildings in the concession is rising. The reason for this is to achieve the education of the Three Principles of the People. [Minzhi] has not been established for long, but its achievements are remarkable. The future efforts and development are immeasurable. I hope that the officials in charge of school affairs will pay special attention to the realization of the Three Principles of the People's education, so that the equipment, curriculum, teaching methods, extracurricular activities, and other facilities are in line with the original purpose of the Three Principles of the People's education, and become a model for concession education. Then, it will not only be the fortune of [Minzhi] but also the fortune of education.</p>
<p>Western calendar Ding Chou</p>
<p>The standard of society</p>
<p>The closing speech for the fifth anniversary of our school (Dai Langhua)</p>
<p>China cannot even talk about education now because most people simply do not understand the necessity of seeking knowledge. The gap between the propertied class and the proletariat is too great. Most rich people rely on their inheritance and power to live without having to seek a living, believing that studying is a painful thing. They do not know that not allowing their children to study is like not allowing them to take the road to self-renewal. As for poor families, they cannot even take care of their basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter, so where would they get the money to provide for education? Therefore, the results on both sides are equivalent to a lack of knowledge. Since the people's knowledge is not widespread, how can the country be strong? Therefore, the strength of the country depends entirely on the development of the people's knowledge.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should first thank the two principals of our school and congratulate them on their success. Our school has been established for five years and has overcome many difficulties to achieve five years of honor and social trust. We should thank them for laying a solid foundation for the future generations of the country to resist the oppression of the great powers and promote people's intelligence so that China can turn from weak to strong. There is another spirit that is even more admirable, that is, the two principals do not hesitate to sacrifice their spirit and money to seek happiness for the society and the country and be pioneers in the education field. Past achievements have been established, and we should work harder to seek future hope. The spirit of cooperation between teachers and students, on the one hand, teachers are enthusiastic about teaching, and students should keep the future of the country in mind. Students, on the other hand, must cultivate excellent knowledge, noble personality, and strong physique in the school to prepare for the future masters and achieve the final goal. This is my hope for the fifth anniversary of our school.</p>

<p>Thoughts on the Fifth Anniversary of Our School by Shi Zhenghong</p>
<p>The world is full of turmoil, and those who are upright, cautious, sincere, and honest have long been rejected by the world. It is especially because they possess unique knowledge and high moral character, but they have no way to stop the decline of morality and the decline of people's hearts. This is the only reason for the decade of instruction, which is to engage in education. Today's education circles are full of thorns and have long been abandoned by the successful. One or two bad apples are still using schools as a tool to make money. When asked, they are proficient in regulations and look imposing, but in fact, they neglect the practical knowledge of managing the world. They only cater to the preferences of young people, allowing extravagance and dissipation to worsen day by day. Their crimes are punishable. Speaking of education</p>
<p>Enlighten the group of heroes Inscription</p>
<p>Is not easy. It must also be strong in resources and dedicated in mind, which is almost the case. My friend Xu Jun Renhan is what is called an upright, cautious, and sincere gentleman. He is dedicated to learning but not rich in resources, but he and his wife, Ms. Gong Bing, founded Minzhi Elementary and Middle School in the western corner of the public concession, and now it has been five years. Compared to the ten-year tree, it is only halfway there. The students have grown from three or so people to hundreds of people, the classes have grown from one or two classes to more than ten classes, and the school buildings have grown from one campus to two or three campuses. His career is flourishing. I have known him for ten years, but I have been struggling in all directions to make a living for several years. He has left the journalism industry and engaged in the education business that people are unwilling to do. Moreover, the school site is in the concession where the right to education has not been recovered. This shows that there is nothing difficult in doing something at the beginning, but as long as you can work hard and be tireless, you will surely succeed. It is okay not to be rich in resources, it is okay not to follow the trend, and it is okay not to be straightforward with the public. If you are not dedicated to your work, you will definitely not succeed. Mr. Xu's career can prove this. My age is similar to that of Mr. Xu, but Mr. Xu's achievements are like this, and my half-life is so wandering. The sea is rising in the east Inscription by Yi</p>
<p>How can I not be filled with regret? When Mr. Xu's school was adding a middle school, he assigned me the teaching of Chinese literature and art. I also felt that I had no flattering bones and could not please the world. In this way, these many innocent and simple students can be with each other in the wind and rain, and it is suitable to be with each other. So I readily agreed. Now it has been two years since then, and there is a happy place in the so-called famous teaching. Will Mr. Xu and I end up with this? Contribution to our school Cai Xingsu</p>
<p>The achievement of a career must have necessary conditions: one is dedication and the other is perseverance. If you have a dedicated mind and a spirit of perseverance, you will definitely achieve something in your career even if you encounter difficulties. The same is true for seeking knowledge and running a school. On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of Minzhi School, I am even more impressed by this. Minzhi was established for only five years, and the people in charge are Mr. Xu Jun Renhan and his wife, Ms. Gong Bingruo, and school board member Mr. Ma Chonggan. School board member Chen Yunyi</p>
<p>Ms., five years is a very short time, and the energy of the two people is limited, but the number of students has increased from three or so people to five or six hundred people, and the number of classes has increased from one class to more than ten classes. Those who come to study have traveled from near and far, from unknown to gradually gaining the trust of the community and families. It has stood out as a unique color in the Chinese-run education in the Shanghai concession. The preparatory office was set up in western Shanghai in the 14th year of the Republic of China, and Mr. Xu Jun and his wife are both researching education and are famous teachers in their hometown. Mr. Xu then came to Shanghai to assist in the editing of the Shen Bao and still advocated education as his ambition. He was saddened that the education in Shanghai, although seemingly prosperous, was not very true to its name. Especially in the concession, the schools run by foreigners were overwhelming, and the Chinese were ignorant of the foreigners' intentions and flocked to them. Education is a career to save the country. With the large population of Shanghai and the lack of perfect Chinese-run education, he was determined to run a school and fulfill the obligation of a national citizen to recover the right to education. His ambition was very great, but the wind at the end of the weed was very weak, and there was no certainty at the beginning. The summer school opened with three students, all of whom were female. Mr. Xu Jun and his wife gathered five or six comrades to teach these three female students. The number of teachers was doubled, and the number of students was increased. Amidst the sweltering summer heat, the sound of books was endless. Today, the rough scale that we have achieved and the slight achievements that we have revealed are all due to the few people in the summer who started the beginning, laid the foundation, sowed the seeds, and cultivated them, and then the comrades and students who came later became more and more bright and expanded it, and then it came to be. Mr. Xu Jun and his wife have been preparing for this ever since, and they have not spent a day in the past five summers and winters without thinking about how to improve the school and how to improve it. Their feet do not leave the school, their mouths do not leave education, their minds are not divided, and their careers are dedicated. They do not have any other affairs.

<p>Cultivating Talents Inscription by Xu Weizhen</p>
<p>I heard that the most important condition for running a business is that the economy is more abundant, and the career can be developed more easily. At the beginning, it was impossible to call for help from the mountains, and it was impossible to ask for help. Due to economic problems, the school was in danger of being overthrown several times, but it was finally able to do its best to save expenses and fulfill its obligations, and the teachers were mostly comrades who did their best to maintain it so that it would not fall and could use the savings to add books and teaching equipment to make all the equipment gradually perfect, and the students could seek the actual benefits of learning. Other difficulties encountered were also similar. Looking back on the past, there are many hardships. Those who are weak in mind and insufficient in perseverance may be confused by the glory, wealth, fame, and fortune in the world and have turned to other things. They stick to this simple career and continue to work tirelessly. Special issue for the fifth anniversary of Shanghai Minzhi Middle School</p>
<p>Cultivating Talents Inscription by Yuan Li of Yin County</p>
<p>In order to achieve its only wish, the second condition for running a business is also close to it. The ultimate purpose of the school is to create useful talents for the country. The rise and fall of the country also depends on the prosperity of education. Therefore, the responsibility of the school is very heavy. Those who are not dedicated and firm will not only destroy the school and reputation and mislead other people's children, but also mislead the country. There is a strange phenomenon in the schools in Shanghai. There are many universities and few middle and elementary schools. The external appearance is Minzhi Middle School for the fifth anniversary</p>
<p>Learning is to increase knowledge Respectfully inscribed by Zhao Xien</p>
<p>The content is not necessarily consistent. The foundation of the country lies in national education, and the achievement of education lies in the spirit. If the school can earnestly and practically seek how to run the school well, the teachers can earnestly and practically seek how to teach the students well, and the students can earnestly and practically seek how to learn knowledge well, then they can be called good schools, good teachers, and good students. It is not necessary to have a large scale or a high name. Minzhi has more and more students, and the school's equipment, etc., are striving to expand. It is hoped that the leaders of all circles and the aspirations of the society will help and promote it, but even if it cannot stand as desired, it will be possible to preserve the past spirit and the spirit of the people based on the existing prototype and the existing foundation.</p>
<p>Minzhi Middle School for the fifth anniversary</p>
<p>Studying Hard to Save the Country</p>
<p>Inscription by Ma Junwu</p>
<p>I can also say that I am studying at this school's fifth anniversary, but this school has progressed so much in these five years. Although I have only been promoted from elementary school to middle school, I am not as talented as this school's progress, which has progressed a thousand miles a day. This is what I am ashamed of, but I have seen this school from the beginning to the perfect stage. In five years, this school has been painstakingly managed to have such a fifth anniversary today, which is so worthy of our cheers and joy.</p>
<p>Shanghai Minzhi Middle School for the fifth anniversary</p>
<p>Do Not Destroy the Foundation</p>
<p>Inscription by Jin Zencheng</p>
<p>In such a blink of an eye, we were able to build such a solid</p>
<p>The foundation has gained a considerable reputation in the society. The five hundred or so teachers and friends are in a hurry, and the spacious and bright school building is magnificent. Isn't this all thanks to the work of the enthusiastic workers in this blink of an eye?</p>
<p>We look back to the few people at the beginning, and we look back to the scene of the previous years. At that time, we would never have predicted the one day today. We didn't even dare to assert that the school's unlimited future is progressing with time.</p>
<p>Strive to Educate</p>
<p>Inscription by Liu Zhanxi</p>
<p>Five years have passed. The past deeds have long been obvious to everyone, and the past deeds will never disappear. We not only celebrate the present, but also foresee the future.</p>
<p>Of course, from the past to the present, and from the present to the future, there is a very unlimited future. The school's future greatness will be ten thousand times greater than today. We wish the school a long life.</p>
<p>What We Want to Say About the Fifth Anniversary of Our School (Jiang Nianqu)</p>
<p>Photograph of the tenth session of female students from the elementary, middle, and kindergarten (Photograph by Wang Kai)</p>
<p>In China, which is oppressed by imperialism, there are many people who have not received education due to economic difficulties. However, it is not without a remedy. Although our country has a considerable plan for educational facilities, there is a great lack of talent to guide reading. Therefore, education cannot keep pace with the countries of the world. The two founders of this school are very enthusiastic about education. They want to save our country and solve the suffering of people who do not know how to read, so they founded this school, named Minzhi, which means to enlighten the people's intelligence.</p>
<p>In the midst of difficulties and hardships, five years have passed unconsciously. In these five weeks, the enthusiastic efforts of the founders and teachers have achieved very good results. It is so difficult to run a school in this concession, but the two founders followed the fearless spirit of the President and unyieldingly created a good foundation for Chinese-run schools in the concession. Such talents are truly worthy of my admiration. Furthermore, in the past five years, the atmosphere of this school has been very good. The students in the school have a competitive mentality towards their studies, and the students are very enthusiastic about patriotic movements. Another characteristic that is different from other schools is that the clothes worn by the students are very clean and simple, without any thought of showing off, and are completely civilianized. This state should be preserved by future students, and do not let the students in the school become aristocratic after another fifth anniversary. Now there is a difficulty in this school, and this school should solve it quickly in the shortest possible time, which is the problem of the school building. It is hoped that a large school building will be built, so that the school will develop day by day and the number of students will increase day by day, and the school building will not be crowded, and it will be good to build its own school building without having to pay huge rents and transfer this money to construction. It is also more reassuring for students to study. However, where does this huge amount of money come from? We must ask the enthusiastic people in the country to make some efforts to promote the school's advocacy of enlightening the people's intelligence. These are the words I want to say.</p>
<p>The Spirit That This School Should Have in the Future by Hong Fanjun</p>
<p>There are many schools in Shanghai, but the quality is not consistent. There is no way to distinguish between them, and they often tend to go to church schools. Chinese school operators do not take reserving talents for the country as their policy, but transfer to personal interests. Therefore, the obstruction of education is as before. Now the principal of this school is aware of this and runs the school wholeheartedly and sincerely. Based on years of experience, the principal of this school has been planning to establish a small-scale school in the spring of the 14th year. At the beginning of the school, everything was unable to compete with other schools, because the face was not enough. However, thanks to the principal's continuous efforts and the enthusiastic teaching of the professors, more and more scholars came and the reputation gradually increased. The school building became wider and wider, and the equipment inside gradually became more perfect. Outside, the speeches often won awards. The achievements of the five years were quite remarkable, but how could the five years of a hundred years of education limit the unlimited education career? Although the development of the future can be based on the achievements of the five years, it also lies in the principal's continued efforts. Since this school has had past achievements, it is not difficult to reach the peak and make foreign schools unable to prevail, so that students know where to go. As a pioneer in recovering the educational rights of the concession, the spirit that should be possessed in this anniversary is enough.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the bond market futures were lively, especially in the afternoon. Apart from the sluggish "Financial No Market," "96," "Continued Roll," and "Seven-Year Continued 25," the "Demobilization," "Customs Tariff Reduction of Troops," and others saw significant price fluctuations and brisk trading. "Whole Six Good Omen" was also active. However, the spot market remained very quiet. The bond market sentiment was poor, and confidence was weak, with supply exceeding demand. Therefore, it was weak from the initial opening in the morning, and the decline intensified later. Demobilization futures almost collapsed and stopped trading. Although they rebounded slightly in the afternoon, they still fell by a substantial three yuan. Customs Tariff and Demobilization fell by about two yuan, and Whole Six Good Omen also fell by one yuan and several jiao. The spot trading volume was 26,000 yuan, and futures exceeded 10 million yuan.</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn: Sharp Decline in the Yarn Market</p>
<p>The yarn market's downward trend has resurfaced, with rapid changes in recent days. The fundamental reason is the decline in the global cotton market, reduced consumption in various countries, and overproduction, making it difficult to be optimistic. It is said that there is a stockpile of over 300,000 bales of Japanese yarn, which is difficult to resolve immediately. Therefore, the previous day's sharp decline was followed by a slight rebound of 20 yuan, but today it fell again by 5 yuan. American cotton is also hovering around 13.25 cents due to lack of demand and abundant inventory, with good weather for new cotton. The local sales of yarn are quite scarce, as exorbitant rice prices and turbulent situations have greatly weakened the purchasing power of various groups. The bottom goods everywhere were mentioned yesterday.</p>
<p>Deteriorating Human Bids Remain Weak: The opening of the human bid market was met with a drop in the price of American cotton, causing a sudden drop in confidence. With few buyers, the selling pressure was particularly strong, with each bid falling by 6-7 qian. News of sluggish sales in the second and third rounds and a large drop in raw cotton prices further weakened the situation, with each bid falling by 6 qian to 1 liang 1 qian to 1 liang 3 qian. The afternoon opening was very weak, with widespread panic, and each bid fell by 5-6 qian. In the second round, the Hengda factory purchased 200 pieces per bid for the July and August contracts, giving the market a boost. The third round rose by 2-3 qian, and the closing price rose again by 2-3 qian, resulting in good prices. 123 qian were sold, with Jifeng, Hengyi, Daji, Yuantai, Tianlong, Shenchang, and Yiyu selling 500 to 2,600 bales, and Hengda, Tongyu, Hanfeng, Shenji, Dafeng, and Xincheng buying 500 to 1,050 bales. The total transaction volume was 25,150 bales. The closing prices of the human bids are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Human Bid Closing | Close | Up/Down | Account Balance |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| September | 1541 | Down 1 | 326800 |</p>
<p>| July | 136 | Down 6 | 21100 |</p>
<p>| October | 1543 | 152 | 7700 |</p>
<p>| August | 1538 | 8 | 28900 |</p>
<p>| November | 1546 | 12 | 16650 |</p>
<p>Mediocre Yarn Sales Fail to Rally: Yarn sales are mediocre. According to statistics, a total of 1,285 bales were purchased from various markets throughout the day. Among them, 925 bales were purchased by fellow traders. The price dropped by 2.5 qian to 7.5 qian. Among the purchasing groups, the Guangdong group purchased the most, totaling 235 bales. In addition, 280 bales were purchased by inland groups, 175 bales by Tianjin groups, 80 bales by Hankou groups, 115 bales by Shantou groups, 280 bales by Niuzhuang groups, 40 bales by Changsha groups, and 75 bales by miscellaneous groups.</p>
<h3 id="e89">The Underlying Condition of the Cotton Market Amid the Sharp Decline <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The drastic decline in the cotton market is mainly due to the global cotton market's downturn. Additionally, the trend of gold prices falling and the exchange rate loosening has made Indian cotton prices relatively cheaper. Many retail investors holding long positions, seeing the unfavorable environment, have had to painfully liquidate their positions. Furthermore, Ruida Company alone sold more than 10,000 dan, causing the market price to decline further, resembling a river flowing downwards. The attitude of various factories is unusually calm, and the situation in the cotton market is very weak. The Han Biao market is full of selling pressure. At the opening of the Han Biao market, the prices of American cotton and yarn fell, causing a sharp drop in confidence. Moreover, large investors were selling off, with each falling by 4 qian, 6.5 qian to 7 qian. In the afternoon, prices fell another 1-2 qian. Hengyi, Gongtai, Daji, Ruida, Yicheng, Yuantai, Changfeng, Shenxin, Tianlong, Hengde, and Yichang sold 1,000 to 11,000 dan, while Shenyu, Rongxing, Taixing, Yongfeng, Tongxing, Shenda, Tianchang, and Xincheng bought 1,100 dan to 3,000 dan. The total transaction volume for the day was 66,400 dan. The closing prices of the Han Biao are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Han Biao Closing Price | Up/Down | Account Balance |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| October | 35.05 | Down 8 | 78300 |</p>
<p>| July | 35.50 | Down 6 | 62800 |</p>
<p>| November | 35.00 | Down 8 | 68700 |</p>
<p>| August | 35.85 | Down 8 | 86900 |</p>
<p>Indian Cotton Invades the Market: There are very few spot cotton transactions, but Indian cotton is coming in droves. The sources include 500 bales of Yao cotton, with the sales listings on the left. The price of Agola is 30.75. Shenxin Factory imported 3,000 pieces, which will be shipped to Shaanxi. The price of Shaanxi cotton is 36.50. Yong'an Factory imported 500 pieces, which will be delivered to the factory on the spot.</p>

<p>American Cotton Declines by More Than 10 Pounds: Yesterday, American cotton declined due to the lack of major buyers and better weather. Wall Street was weak, and the market was sluggish. Futures fell by 10-18 points, and spot prices fell by 20 points. British cotton futures rose by 2 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. The Indian cotton market was weak, with Pingguoer's near and far terms up 1 rupee and Omula's far terms unchanged by 1 rupee. Bailuoxi's near and far terms were up 3 rupees.

<h3 id="e92">The Evolution of Three-Grade Yarn and the Japanese-Shanghai Exchange Rate Over the Past Eighteen Years <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The gradual downward trend of Japanese Three-Grade Yarn and the rise of the Chinese yarn market have not been significantly affected by the preciousness of gold and the cheapness of silver. The fluctuations of Three-Grade Yarn and the changes in the Eastern Exchange Rate have progressed in inverse proportion. Recently, the Japanese market has plummeted again, seeing a low price of 98 yuan, with only a difference of over 10 yuan from the new low price of Min San. The arrival of Japanese yarn in Shanghai is already a favorable and formidable threat, and its impact is immediately visible. The following table lists the changes in Three-Grade Yarn and the Eastern Exchange Rate since the first year of the Republic of China (the average price of Three-Grade Yarn, the daily exchange rate between Japanese and Shanghai currencies for 100 yuan in gold, and the average price of the highest and lowest regulations are listed for the months with the highest and lowest yarn market prices):</p>

<h3 id="e93">American Cooperative Absorbs Raw Cotton <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Better Progress in Cotton Assessment: Cotton Demand Still Stagnant</p>
<p>A telegram on the 27th reported on the cotton market situation for the week, stating that the cotton price decline began in mid-July. The reasons for this decline were the settlement of the July contract and news of warmer weather and faster development of Southern cotton crops. However, when the new transaction market price for the October contract reached 12.5 cents, the decline stopped due to increased demand from traders and short covering. The number of unsettled long positions for the July contract was significantly higher than expected by various parties. On Wednesday of the week, the cooperative quickly absorbed the announced sale of 114,000 bales. On Thursday, it absorbed some more. At the end of the week, the July contract market was firmer than before. The Central cotton belt currently needs rain, and the recent high temperatures in the South have caused some unease. In other respects, the progress of the new cotton crop is better than before. Merchants expect the private report on the cotton production situation at the end of the month to have a higher figure compared to previous reports.</p>
<p>Furthermore, people in the cotton market believe that the market price has reached a level where it is possible to buy, and the stock market has better sentiment, so the buying trend has slightly increased. The high temperature in the central part of the cotton industry has caused some concern, but it is not yet considered a major event. Cotton crops are progressing well, spot demand is sluggish, and cotton trade remains quiet. The weekend statistics are attached below (unit: thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Grain: Lower River Rice Market Opens Within Limits</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of goods at Zhabei was still scarce, and most of the registered cargo customers had already sold within the limit. This matter was resolved after the Social Bureau declared that it would be handled by the Bureau and then assigned to the rice shops. The commission for all rice merchants will be temporarily registered, and after the inventory is cleared, it will be jointly distributed. Therefore, most of the cargo customers, seeing the environment like this and the weather getting hotter, and the cargo being delayed in the river for a long time, which is not appropriate, and only incurring losses if delayed, automatically sold to the authorities. The highest price for Northern Japonica rice was 21 yuan, and the second-best was slightly lower. Thin rice also followed the Japonica market. The total number of bushels throughout the day was estimated to be over 2,000 shi. The remaining inventory today and tomorrow may be cleared. Because Metamorphosis Yuan is in the fancy category, it will still be handled according to the previous regulations and sold through the rice merchant's sample platform. The large market saw weakness, with the high price for high-quality goods on the market being around 19.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Only one ship arrived at the Lower River in South Shanghai from the Tongli gang, and it was sold out on the same day. Metamorphosis Yuan, foreign sharp corners returned to small triangles. There was no Northern Japonica rice or early and late rice available on the market. The situation was extremely quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Continued Weakness in Newly Arrived Foreign Rice <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, because a large batch of new foreign rice arrived, the importing merchants waited and watched. Therefore, the market opened with a soft trend, followed by more floating lots and the market becoming even softer. However, because Dumi limited its price, the source became even more balanced, and it will be even more difficult to arrive in the future. Because the inland market price is higher than the Shanghai market, vendors do not dare to try. Therefore, foreign rice is welcomed in this street. Although the passenger transportation has stopped, the market will turn stable again. As a result, it continued to be slightly lower by about 1 jiao compared to the previous market. The total market transaction was 7,000 bags of small grain at a price of 17 yuan 2.5 jiao, 3,000 bags of large grain at a price of 16 yuan 9 jiao, 1,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon at a price of 18 yuan 6.7 jiao, 1,500 bags of No. 2 at a price of 18 yuan 2.5 jiao, 500 bags of Min Dang at a price of 16 yuan 7.5 jiao, and 200 bags of Kagai at a price of 17 yuan 7.4 cents. In addition, there were also over 3,000 bags of various types of brown rice and road goods, with prices close to the small grain.</p>

<p>This year, 5 million bags of foreign rice have arrived, with large and small grains exported from Leigon accounting for the majority. Saigon rice only accounts for one-third. About 1 million bags have not yet been loaded, and there are about hundreds of thousands of bags of road goods. There have been very few new transactions, with only less than 1,000 tons reported.</p>
<h3 id="e96">The Flour Market Presents a Withered State Again <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Thick Factory Inventory... Sluggish Sales... Sharp Fall in the Gold Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market presented a withered state again. This month, because the delivery is near, being the last day of trading, the Northern gangs ultimately found the market value too high to be in line with their plans, and they rarely showed interest. Most investors with long positions, seeing that the factory's inventory is gradually becoming abundant and actual sales are sluggish, had to settle the futures for this month. Therefore, the opening price fell, and the lowest price returned to 2 liang 5 qian. The distant months were quite lively at the initial opening in the morning, but as the factories successively released their positions and the sharp fall in the gold market was heard, caution turned to softness, and it became sluggish. The situation was not good in the afternoon. Judging from the current market trend, factories and traders in the local market are not optimistic. Only the attitudes of the gangs in Wuxi, Suzhou, and other inland areas have remained unchanged, and they have frequently absorbed. Therefore, the high and low prices will only be determined when the news of Xiangfen's sales comes out. As a result, this month fell by 2 fen 7.5 li, July-August fell by a small 7.5 li, September fell by a small 1 fen 2.5 li, October fell by a small 2 fen 2.5 li, and November fell by a small 2 fen 2.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Wheat Futures Market Finally Falls <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed an initial firmness followed by a continued weakness in each month. In the morning, because the quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly better by 2-3 qian, people were thinking of rallying. However, in the afternoon, because the flour market turned weak and the gold price fell sharply again, the overall sentiment was inevitably affected. Observing the current market trend, the local factories and traders are not optimistic. Only the attitudes of the inland gangs in Wuxi and Suzhou have remained unchanged, and they have frequently absorbed. Therefore, the high and low prices will only be determined by the news of incense and flour sales. As a result, July-September fell by a small 3 fen each, August-November fell by a small 1 fen, and October fell by 2 fen. Because the arrival of spot wheat is smooth and the factory stomachs are average, each position is shouting for a lower price of around 3 fen. A total of 10,000 bags of wheat from Taizhou, Shashi, Nanjing, Gaoyou, Yangzhou, etc., and 800 bags of wheat from Zhenche were handled by Fuxin and Fufeng.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 150 pieces of Huzhou silk were shipped to New York yesterday.</p>
<p>100,000 silver dollars were shipped to Shantou.</p>
<p>700 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou and Xiamen, Guangdong.</p>
<p>6,000 bags of sesame were shipped to Italy.</p>
<p>4,000 pieces of Indian hemp were imported yesterday.</p>
<p>100 pieces of rubber were shipped from Singapore.</p>
<p>4,000 pieces of wood were shipped from Nanyang to Shanghai.</p>

<p>(Editor)</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow. It has been five years since the establishment of our school. The staff is limited in knowledge and experience. We have worked hard for five years, and there have been times when we were in danger of failure. We believe that schools are public instruments of society, and the people of the country should first recognize them and then pay attention to them. In particular, the citizens of this city should use the space of Shenbao to briefly publish the school's management process and recent situation in words and photos, so that they can meet the people of the country and leave a considerable impression. This is the first reason why the staff has edited and printed this publication.</p>
<p>The school has only been managed for five years, and its history is still shallow, and its facilities are incomplete. Like a person, it is still in its infancy, its physical strength is insufficient, and its knowledge is immature. We hope that those who sympathize with the school will provide support and care, and that the intellectual community will provide guidance and correction, so that the school can progress with the years and last for a long time. This is the second reason why the staff has edited and printed this publication.</p>
<p>It is not that this is the only reason. The birth of our school originally had the mission of opening up people's minds and recovering educational rights. However, due to limited ability and insufficient strength, we have not yet completed it after five years of struggle. We believe that in the future, we should maintain the spirit of the past, gather the strength of the majority of comrades, divide the work and cooperate, and hold on with determination. Over time, we will definitely make the Chinese in the concession literate more and gradually recover educational rights invisibly, so that it will be of some help to national sovereignty, people's education, and social construction. On the occasion of the fifth anniversary, we will arouse the past and awaken the future, set a benchmark, and work together to achieve it, regardless of success or failure. This is the third reason why the staff has edited and printed this publication.</p>
<p>There is one more thing to mention. This publication is limited in scope and time, and there are inevitable omissions. We hope that all readers will provide more guidance to correct the shortcomings of the staff. We are currently working on editing and printing a commemorative album, which will be published after the weather cools down in autumn. At that time, we will seek corrections from all gentlemen again.</p>

<p>The Star Film Company announces that "Romantic Woman" is a new romantic police film recently produced simultaneously with "Peach Blossom Lake" and "Water Margin" by this company. Since the start of filming, they have been working day and night. The leading role of "Romantic Woman" has been changed several times, and it was finally decided that the famous actress Xuan Jinglin would play the role. Since Xuan stopped acting, audiences of domestic films have missed her very much. This time, she returns to the screen and gets a role that fits her personality, which allows her to show her strengths. Since the news came out, letters inquiring about the release date have been pouring in every day. Director Cheng Bugao is dedicating himself fully to this film, and every scene is depicted with the latest directing techniques. The film will be completed in one or two weeks, and the release date is not far away.</p>
<p>The Zhongshan Grand Theater announces that it will be showing "Echo in the Empty Valley" directed by Ma-Xu Weibang starting today. This film has been shown in various theaters, and the box office and public opinion have been very good. This time, a French song and dance troupe that recently arrived in Shanghai has been hired to perform on stage, including Gypsy dance, Hawaiian dance, Yin Island dance, and Western closet scenes.</p>

<p>Service of This Year's Graduates from Jiaotong University</p>
<p>Before each year's graduates from Jiaotong University graduate, they are recruited with heavy money. This year's graduates are no exception. The Construction Committee has sent a letter requesting the employment of as many as fifteen students from the Electrical Engineering Department's Telecommunications program to serve as engineers in various electrical engineering projects. Students from the Power Engineering program have also received letters from many power plants both inside and outside the city requesting their employment. Many mechanical engineering students have also accepted employment from a large factory in this city. Those who have not been hired will be uniformly dispatched by the Ministry of Railways to various railway bureaus for service. Students from the Management School, because their studies are in specialized railway management, are uniformly dispatched by the Ministry of Railways to various routes for one year of internship, after which they will all be promoted to formal railway staff. This year's total of more than one hundred and twenty graduates, more than fifty people have been employed by outside parties, while those employed by the Ministry of Railways are only more than seventy people. Nowadays, in China, there is a surplus of people for positions, and it is very difficult for university graduates to seek employment. Therefore, the number of unemployed university graduates is countless. However, the Jiaotong University authorities are able to plan the students' future, so that graduates have no fear of unemployment and no need to change careers, in order to fulfill the Ministry of Railways' and the government authorities' original intention of cultivating specialized talents. Among all national universities, at most, they can only be responsible for introducing a few students with excellent grades, and it is impossible to introduce all of them. This move by the school is really commendable, and it is also due to its excellent results. (Duan)</p>
<p>Jiaotong University Hires a Sports Coach</p>
<p>Since Yuan Dongjun, a Far Eastern athlete, published his opinion that the reason for our country's failure in the Far Eastern Games was the lack of sports guidance, the Jiaotong University authorities have been able to accommodate Yuan's opinion and actively promote sports to strengthen students' bodies and promote our country's international spirit. Starting next semester, they have specially hired sports expert Shen Guoquan as the school's sports coach. Shen is Korean and graduated from Nanyang University in 1924. During his time at school, his athletic reputation had already spread far and wide. In the past, Nanyang's victory over the John Football Team was entirely due to Shen's efforts. After graduating, because his sports knowledge was not sufficient, he specially studied sports at the Teachers College of Columbia University in the United States for five years. In the United States, he participated in various competitions, and Americans were amazed by him. After returning to China last year, President Li of Jiaotong University wanted to hire him as the director of sports, but it did not happen for some reason. It has been decided to hire him as a sports coach and director next semester. The former director of the library, Huang Wenjian, resigned and went elsewhere, and the current director of sports, Tang Shuping, was transferred to fill the position of director of the library. The position of director of sports left by Tang will be filled by Shen. It is heard that in addition to Shen, Jiaotong University will also hire many sports coaches, all of whom are experts of the time. (Duan)</p>
<p>Our Principal</p>
<p>The newspapers these past few days have been busy publishing the graduation ceremonies of various schools. Our school has never published any literary works or discussions on educational issues, not to mention graduation ceremonies. Everything is in a state of silence, and there is no expectation of development. Although there are quite a few students in the school who study hard, most of them hold vague ideas. Their purpose in studying is because they have nothing to do, and studying is a pastime (I am also a student and do not intend to slander them). To know the current situation in China, graduates of Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School, Yin Weihua (photo by Chang Lie)</p>
<p>we students who have the opportunity to study should quickly work hard and move forward to create for society and find a way out for the nation. Where is the bright path? Our principal, although she has a kind of gentle smile, has not done anything to increase the students' knowledge and health. In terms of sports, she collected the students' sports fees, but there are no sports facilities, and there is no formal library, only a few mediocre English books and a few translated Chinese novels. I can't find a single magazine that is beneficial to the students. This is supposed to be reference material for us. Speaking of the teachers who are hired, except for one or two who understand teaching methods, the rest are here to solve their livelihood problems. I have already taken the wrong path into this kind of school.</p>
<p>The school's aim is that Chinese and English are equally important, so the graduation ceremony should of course be the same. But it is not like this. The English class graduates are all spirited and lively, sitting on the stage one by one to receive their diplomas. We Chinese graduates are all standing outside the door. I am not here for the sake of getting a diploma. In fact, what is the use of us getting a diploma that is almost equivalent to waste paper? However, although the principal is a Christian, she is not a foreigner.</p>
<p>A word to students who are transferring schools: when entering a school, be sure to carefully consider the content of the school. We want to gain practical knowledge, not study appearances. (Zhu Yun)</p>
