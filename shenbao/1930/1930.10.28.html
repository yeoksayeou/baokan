<h3>付之一笑</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>甲　我今天簡直認不得你的父親了他老人家先前不是有一部又黑又濃的大鬍子的麽現在到那裹去了</p>
<p>乙　已全部剪掉了</p>
<p>甲　可惜可惜這樣好看的鬍子怎麽肯輕輕的犧牲</p>
<p>乙　只爲家母夜間睡覺嫌枕頭硬所以要他老人家的鬍子塞在枕頭裹</p>
<p>慈善家（向一富婦募捐）太太你要知道這裹的市民都是可憐得很他們的生活長在黑暗之中得不到一線光明</p>
<p>富婦　那麽我這裹有火柴在着你拿去給他們點火吧</p>
<p>甲女　你怎麽如此慷慨給那瞎眼的化子兩角錢</p>
<p>乙女　他說了許多好話使我很爲感動并且稱我爲美麗的小姐</p>
<p>甲女　這就呌做瞎子說瞎話</p>
<p>女　母親常常提起你</p>
<p>男　那是榮幸得很伊可是說甚麽好話麽</p>
<p>女　伊說你是一個天生的政治家</p>
<p>男　不錯不錯我將來原要做官去那時你不是一位官太太麽</p>
<p>女　但伊老人家說你在吾家走動得很勤又常在許願說我們倆訂婚後如何如何結婚後又如何如何可是口惠而實不至正像他們政治家對付人民一樣</p>

<h3>脫髪預防法</h3>
<p>— 良驥</p>
<p>（一）洗頭之時用冷熱水互相使用（此法對於頭皮下的血液循環甚爲的益）</p>
<p>（一）洗頭之後須令乾透再加生髮香油數滴</p>
<p>（一）洗頭水内可加炭酸冰</p>
<p>（一）用腦筋不宜過度（故文藝界及各機關之重要職員多秃髮）</p>
<p>（一）不宜常常戴帽</p>
<p>（一）頭汗宜常洗或加拭凈因出汗最於頭髮不利（運動家陸軍軍人所以多秃髮者即爲出汗太多之故）</p>
<p>（一）髮宜常常梳理</p>

<h3>期麥市橫衝直撞</h3>
<p>銳落而暴進錢九分差次昨日期麥市面上午開盤後本月份市面曾發生巨大之變動當初開時因傳多方已無收貨之意致浮多方面祗好紛紛脫手故開價尙係四兩四錢六分旋又跌至四兩四錢一分較前週之收價又狂跌九分之巨但至二盤以後因廠家鑒於如是奇廉買現貨不若又改標準故市氣似又轉勁迨至下午開盤因廠家仍有收進浮空則不得不補故又績好迨至收盤因尙有少數浮空未補多方則扳售不放因此竟提六錢之高價較上午之最低價差次竟逹一錢九分雙</p>
<p>方爭競之烈於是可見（結果聞福新須收三十五六車）遠期各月份初亦甚平後因近期暴漲亦見帶起結果本月份較前週漲九分十一月份小一分十二月份小二分正月份小一分二月份小二分三月份小三分</p>

<h3>北遊印象</h3>
<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>在鷗家這晚上有我和萻蕾社的同人</p>
<p>鷗給第一次見面友人介紹了之後於是他又忙地走開了他把吉逹兒曼多林咪呵林他所有的樂器搬了出來他的夫人和妹妹也跟了出來於是一個音樂會開始了</p>
<p>鷗粤人僑居哈濱十餘年了他是學醫的他全家父親母親他和他妹妹都是醫生然而他却似乎對研究藝術的興趨來得更濃些他研究過三四年的繪畫他跟一位俄國樂師學了六年的吉逹爾他又是萻蕾文藝社最努力的份子然而大家都知道他是醫科專門的學生</p>
<p>他有一個白鷗絃組這晚上他們開始演奏了用音樂待他的朋友們朋友們都高興與他交際</p>
<p>他是有時彈吉逹爾吉逹爾是一種最複雜的彈絃樂器這樂器在歐洲中世紀很盛行然而現在在俄國仍很盛行俄國人有一個歌說（什麽我也不要我只要酒處女和吉逹爾）俄國通用的吉逹爾都是七根絃英美各國的則六根絃並彈法也不同俄人係抱著彈英美人則平放在腿上彈在哈爾濱是俄國式上海就是美國式了他用吉逹爾來代替鋼琴他妹妹他夫人都彈曼多林或班周有時他拉梵亞林趙君也加入他們絃組帮忙因爲人不夠</p>
<p>平靑文羅四人遲到了大家齋問他們遲到的原因</p>
<p>（呵我們今天在體育塲看全國哄動的女短跑家孫桂雲女士呢）羅說</p>
<p>（你别說了一切失敗在你手上）平說（文你報告給他們吧）</p>
<p>（靑報告吧）</p>
<p>（好吧）靑說忍不住笑（我們今天到體育塲去自然是要看孫桂雲女士了很巧運動完曅了就遇到孫女士的令兄當他的妹妹結隊出塲的時候他喊道（妹妹來來我給你介紹介紹幾位友人）我們高興得心跳了孫女士跳不她用她賽跑的步法跑來了羅在最先她向羅一點頭可是羅一切失敗在他手裏我們總以爲他在還禮她的時候要伸一隻手前去那末我們大家都可以去接觸一下女運動家的皮膚了誰知羅他簡直連帽子都急得忘了脫自然第二平第四個文到最後一個我怎麽好破先咧呢這樣大家一回沈默她孫女士不耐煩了仍用賽跑的步法跑回隊裏去可是這位女運動家的令兄却和我們談不休止這是我們遲到的原因</p>
<p>大家都哄笑了</p>
<p>（你們怎麽見了大名鼎鼎的女運動家都變成了鄕曲呢）</p>
<p>鷗繼續彈起吉逹爾來</p>
<h3>秋霖之夜</h3>
<p>— 少珍</p>
<p>（下）</p>
<p>這一天我們除了架厘鷄之外還吃了三樣愛吃的小菜一共化了兩塊多錢在會鈔的時候榮連帶地從口袋裏取出一封信來我陡然起了緊張以爲又是一個甚麽女人寄給他的情書了忙伸過手去奪那封信猝然地說（誰寄給你的）</p>
<p>榮見了我這副慌張的神情望住我微笑隨把信遞給我</p>
<p>不曉得誰寄給我的這兩張新東方劇場的贈券</p>
<p>我接了感到兩頰發熱一直從眼角耳際熱上來很懊悔自已一時的孟浪錯疑了我親愛的榮禁不住不好意思起來勉强拿笑來遮掩自已的慚愧但榮若無其事似地熊度依還是這麽底溫雅沉默我益發見到榮的可愛了</p>
<p>國劇改良的國劇是時代底需求啊我們一起去看好吧我玩弄着兩張贈券</p>
<p>好呀我們需要文藝戲劇原就是文藝之一我們也需要民族主義的戲劇了現時代該有這麽一個運動的我們倒要看看他們運動的條件是不是合於時代底需求</p>
<p>他們今日演的是歌劇（王昭君）和（女起解）我今早在報紙的後幅廣告上見到了他們的廣告的說得很爲天花亂墜呢可不曉得他們的（王昭君）是不是就如粤劇之所謂（昭君怨）</p>
<p>那先要知道他們的取材是不是根據正史或者傳說但據我個人推測起來他們的取材總多少有與粤劇（昭君怨）類似之處是無疑的因爲粤劇（昭君怨）取材於傳說事蹟哀艷凄麗容易引起觀者的同情他們總不出這範圍之外</p>
<p>那末新東方的（王昭君）是會引起觀者的同情是一定的了</p>
<p>難說恐怕事績雖則哀艷凄麗表現的藝術手腕或許太於平庸事蹟反爲所累我這句話是根據一般的觀察的我們中國根本没有戲劇底天才比如我這一班愛好文藝的朋友們有價値的文章雖然做得很多可對於戲劇方面就絶少貢獻以此例彼便可以想見了然也不能一槪抹煞的或許新東方的（王昭君）是戨劇運動的一枝肥壯的芽兒時候不早了我們先去看過明白再來講話吧</p>
<p>於是我們便離開新雅走到新東方那時正是它上演的時候</p>
<p>新東方先前是東洋人的演藝館我們十去年曾到過一次印象雖不很惡也不很佳這回全部都加以鬆漆在外表是全新的了不過一切都還留着中國京劇塲的舊習慣的殘跡如泡茶熱手巾之類</p>
<p>（王昭君）在演着了唱詞念白佈景服裝確然與舊劇兩樣不過我總覺得不大對胃口便向榮（你以爲怎樣）</p>
<p>還差强人意總算比較地進一步了不過我們要加以原諒的這是他們的處女作而且時間怱促據他們自已在戲劇第一期裏說當然有許多瑕疵的我們想要在戲劇上看到成熟的作品還要他們經過幾時的努力運動呢</p>
<p>（戲劇）第一期你看過了嗎</p>
<p>在朋友家裏翻過幾頁的但全本没有看過祇讀過了朱君和向君那兩篇文章</p>
<p>他們兩位都有作品在裏面嗎</p>
<p>是的朱君那篇文章是在民族立塲上說的話向君的便是一篇考據的藝術作品了這兩篇文章都値得一讀</p>
<p>他們對於這（王昭君）有甚麽批評没有</p>
<p>没有他們在做文章的時候是没有看過這（王昭君）的</p>
<p>那你對於它有甚麽批評呢</p>
<p>可以說有也可以說没有我剛才說還差强人意總算比較地進一步了便就是我對於這劇全劇的批評</p>
<p>你對於李連麗有甚麽意見</p>
<p>我對於她的來歷完全不懂但似乎是廣東人而且對於粤曲又似乎有相當的研究</p>
<p>你怎估量她是廣東人</p>
<p>因爲她生成一副我們廣東人的面孔</p>
<p>演到這裏（女起解）便上塲這劇是用京曲腔調的而對情節則與京劇兩樣這就是多了曲折多了穿揷閔翠英眞令我表示擁戴扮相固然很好而在表演上所有劇中人蘇三的愛怨凄戚痛楚悲苦都曲曲傳出噪音雖低但百囀千啼正好像黄　低唱這實足以使人彽徊欣賞我問榮這劇如何他說許是有了模彷所以比較（王昭君）更有力地撼人内情尤其是容易引起荏性的東方婦女的内心共嗚不過就題材上說王昭君是比它好過萬倍的如果他們不憚煩地把王昭君的劇本再精心地加以修改重行排演予戲劇以一種新的生命予頽廢的民族以一種有力底棒喝則女起解可以不必演了</p>
<p>但是我以爲（女起解）有了閔翠英不妨在新東方開演的因爲（女起解）本來是一齣很出名的舊劇祗支離陳腐生命已失新東方旣稱爲改良國劇的演藝塲那正好把它賦予一個新的生命就敎閔翠英做它的靈魂你看閔翠英是多麽可愛的一位綺年玉貌的姐兒啊雖則在演藝上不無可以批評的地方但這關係完全是年幾太靑修養未到的原故若果假以時日這（女起解）自會藉她的卓特底天才和將來底修養而給與世人深澈地認識了即如我現在在這裏已然是喜歡（女起解）而不喜歡（王昭君）呢</p>
<p>你的話你的喜歡都很對的自然我也表示同情不過我之所以有剛才的一句話就因爲（王昭君）這個題材好過（女起解）多多然而它之所以好先前已經表白過現在可不必加以說明算了吧不必嘮叨叨地談丢了戲不看了你瞧閔翠英這懸胆般的鼻子多麽美啊</p>
<p>唔黑大的眼睛也很好呢小口朱唇牙齒都不錯</p>
<p>說到這裏塲外的四圍突的打起又一種重大的聲浪給全塲的觀衆起了無限底緊張毎個人都向窗外去望原來是秋霖夜降滂沱地瀉到人間來使全塲四座凉生蕭然感到一種秋意及至鑼歇鼓停玄簾埀下聲潮澎湃觀客便隨以出塲各作鳥獸散時而滂沱大雨迄未曾停黃包車夫索價奇昻顧亦不能稍與論價我們在屈服於夜降的秋霖之中在一箭之歸途已花去小洋六角</p>
<p>歸家後褪卸濕衣不禁喟然一聲說（啊秋霖之夜）</p>

<h3>鴛鴦湖之秋</h3>
<p>— 問鵑</p>
<p>終日埋頭工作頗覺精神疲倦於是倡議到鴛鴦湖去因爲這地方就在滬杭路上往來旣便况且薇又是嘉興的土著有她領導不愁碰陌生的釘子了雙十節放假之暇我們四個人便携裝出發</p>
<p>坐在火車裏還不到兩個半鐘頭的時候遠遠已經望見一派烟波如畫在面前靜靜地展開著這便是嘉興城外著名的鴛鴦湖又呌南湖算是浙西的名勝之一</p>
<p>我們下了車薇先去僱船我和冰兩人管理著籐籃和照相架等等靑去買點小吃的東西船僱好了是老太婆船價錢只要三角便可以直逹烟雨樓倘然是姑娘船那就貴了起碼一元姑娘的面孔越漂亮船價也越貴同樣這點水路竟有貴到五六塊錢以上的我們旣不是憐香惜玉的花花公子所以老太婆倒也不妨只要她的船不破就是了然而這也幸虧薇是本地人所以知道這些花樣而不至上當否則定要多花寃錢了</p>
<p>大家上了船一路咿咿唖唖地盪入波心遙望遠水含烟上接天際這裏那裏一片片的菱花擋住去路船娘左右轉折由劃定的水港中鼓掉前進</p>
<p>船抵烟雨樓上岸揀一處比較僻靜的小亭坐下堂倌泡上茶來除開瓜子花生的小碟子以外還附帶著兩碟（燒賣）這燒賣是此地的特産據說附近二三百里地方所有的燒賣都不如他那裏的好我想這或者也是言之過甚罷了於是也嘗了一只是蟹粉的味道確還不錯</p>
<p>俯瞰堤上在野樹參差的中間有許多牽牛的藤間著　　的紅花綠葉從這一棵樹攀到那一棵樹造成無數的穹窿和屏障這些藤蔓飄拂著她們的長條和細葉好像是人工扎就的綵子遠望岸邊水際萍花伴著紅蓼組成隊伍似的沿著湖身延長到不知終極水無盡這些錦繡的衣衫亦無盡自然界的偉大眞不是渺小的我們所能夠加以測量的</p>
<p>這烟雨樓我曾到過一次但已是許多年前的事了風景依然而我們的韶華却已從暗中飛逝了不少正在憑欄感嘆的時候冷不防我的嘴被東西塞住了是一隻剝了殻的鮮菱薇大笑道</p>
<p>（上了我的當了那是没有去掉二皮的你也不覺得澀嗎）</p>
<p>我連忙吐出口裏果然覺得有點澀澀的於是不再傷今吊古就跟她們圍坐吃起菱來吃了一陣子靑忽然吵著要吃熟鍋菱了原來她也是精於此道的翠綠的一盤子熱氣騰騰的熟菱被送上來銅鍋菱果然好吃又糯又軟很溫柔的顯出江南的風味</p>
<p>（這是嘉興人的代表啊軟軟地最容易被人征服）冰的話還不曾說完臉上已著了一把菱殻她便逃出亭外溜進假山洞裏去完成她那征服嘉興人的工作去了</p>
<p>付過茶錢從新上船到對面的小烟雨樓去這所在也是湖中的一島不過面積比烟雨樓要小得多除開幾行埀柳靜靜地罨罩著一座古廟之外幾乎找不到另外的一花一木我們繫舟柳蔭下取出帶來的月餅罐頭麵包等等大嚼</p>
<p>老船娘吃著我們給她的廣東月餅表示十分歡喜又從火艙裏模出一只酒瓶來一邊獨酌一邊說</p>
<p>（這月餅配着紹興酒吃恰好不然就過於甜腻了）</p>
<p>從她毎一咀嚼的動作當中可以領略到戲劇的意義</p>
<p>冰淘氣她要問船娘討酒吃我們也鼓動著於是你一杯我一杯傾刻之間把一只酒瓶倒空了冰已有點醉意噹啷一聲酒杯跌在船板上了她們三人正閙著祇聽得遠遠有批亞娜的聲音我們辨出這是蕭邦的夜曲大家立刻肅靜下來一聲不響地聽他彈奏</p>
<p>夜的孤寂而又幽怨的低語之聲衰弱但又充滿希望這些聲響從毎一個音波的抖顫中間經過水面而送入我們耳朶裏的時候只覺得聽見的不是音樂而是深藏在人類靈魂中的一些可寳貴的言語他期待著他憂傷著一種溫柔的熱情嗚咽地散佈在寂寞的空間</p>
<p>琴聲歇後大家方從夢幻似的境界中回復過來推醒了正在打盹的船娘呌她送我們回去九點左右的時候月亮剛剛上昇一路波平如鏡在夜霧迷離中更加顯出她的無窮幽美與無窮偉大來秋天的夜景眞是値得留戀的隨便是一株蘆葦也好總是富於詩意而動人感念的眼面前天與水之分野只是動與靜的不同我們身坐船中還以爲是舟行天上咧</p>

<h3>前鋒周報</h3>
<p>— 湯彬</p>
<p>第十七期</p>
<p>提倡民族主義文藝最有力的（前鋒周報）在最近所出版的數期中在文章的本質上是更有驚人的進展尤其是關於理論與批評的第十七期的内容計包括幾篇極形重要而精悍的文章（一）湯冰若的（民族主義的詩歌論）（二）正覺的評駁（覺悟）的（民族主義文藝應該避免的幾種態度）（三）錦軒的談鋒兩篇（甲（秘密）（乙）（四馬路的文化事業）（四）爭波譯的）兩個孤兒）續稿這幾篇文章我們都有一讀的必要</p>
<p>（民族主義的詩歌論）據錦軒在（編輯室談話）裏說是長約萬言的巨論這期雖然祇頭了三千餘字但是作者對於民族主義的詩歌所産的必然的原因詩歌在藝術上底表現與其具有的原素都有詳細的解說和分析徴引歐洲文明民族的文學形式最古的羅馬的叙事詩（伊利亞特）和（奥特賽）與及中國最古的民間作品詩經以證明詩歌在原始底狀態中已成爲民族的實際生活上必然的産物决不是憑空從消閒的動機而産生的一種東西由此可見民族主義的詩歌是具有悠久的歷史它底偉大及藝術上的價値是不言而可明白的了同時作者將現在（我們所需要的詩人）所謂普羅詩歌那種粗暴的描寫應該根本消滅的種種問題均發揮得盡善盡美舉如</p>
<p>在今日我們中華民族受着雙重壓</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>迫因此我們所需要的詩人應該除掉利已的個人主義的啤　爲整個中華民族的前途而喊叫盡量暴露帝國主義在我們中國威施侵略政策喚起被壓迫的新興民族積極地覺醒發掦中華民族已經形成的民間思想創造中華民族底新生命這些都須由詩歌裏表現出來賴乎現代詩人底偉大的力量</p>
<p>接着作者將（爲整個中華民族的前途而喊呌）的一句加以詳盡的解釋這當然是專指所謂普羅詩歌而言但是這解釋在本文中也是非常的重要</p>
<p>不過這裏所說的（喊叫）與（呼號）等等决不是在中國詩壇上曾經流行一時的所謂普羅詩歌那種極其粗暴的描寫專以暴力與刀鐵作詩歌的題材將蘇俄民族的血汁灌輸於中華民族的微血管中這種盲目的幻想在事實上當然不能成立而它那種根本就忘記詩底藝術原素的殘酷的描寫也不能感動讀者的心靈而傳之永久這是極形顯明的事實</p>
<p>關於此節所寫作者完全抱着客觀的態度將普羅詩歌的表現以藝術的眼光來指出它底謬誤這種正確的立論在建設民族主義的詩歌觀點上是不可有以缺乏以下（民族主義的詩歌形成）一節將詩歌的起源發揮得淋漓盡緻徴引歐洲等地著名叙事詩的長成尤爲詳盡因幅篇所限從略分析</p>
<p>評駁（覺悟）的（民族主義文藝應該避免的幾種態度）一文尤値得我們底注意</p>
<p>民族主義文藝運動自本年六月一日發動以來積極地引起丁國内外文壇的注意因爲民族主義文藝的理論和創作在現今必然的有如異軍般的突起却是歷史的背景和現社會的環境所促成的祗須觀察（民族主義文藝運動）宣言一文便能明白無疑的了同時爲了民族主義文藝（實際早已有鞏固的基礎）突現於現實的文壇引起一般不能了解藝術的眞諦和不懂得文藝思潮的人底誤會曲解誣篾和盲犬一樣的在狂吠當然也是在預料之中例如十月八日的（覺悟）上發現了一篇正平君的大文（民族主義文藝應該避免的幾種態度）便是對於文藝現象與思潮盲目無知的人所發出來的一種不通的論調眞的（他指該文的作者正平企圖着把理論曲解事實掩滅矇蔽讀者力事詆毁）根本就說不到對於民族主義文藝有所正確的批判與瞭解正覺所評駁的一文是完全以民族主義文藝的正確理論爲根據用客觀的藝術手腕將荒謬的議論加以分析最後將民族主義文藝的意義透澈地發揮同時對那盲目無知於文藝者的亦開了一條認識民族主義文藝的先河所以正覺君此篇評駁的文字在本期（前鋒周報）裏實佔了重要的位置深望讀者們注意</p>
<p>其它數文都値得我們冷靜地鑑賞因爲的篇幅關係恕不一一地加以分析了</p>
<h3>草野周刋</h3>
<p>— 南心</p>
<p>三卷十一號</p>
<p>這一期的（草野周刋）内容却是特别的豐富與飽滿雖然祗刋載六篇文章但是屬於文藝範圍之内的都包涵盡緻的了</p>
<p>王墳的（民族主義文藝的創作理論）是一篇短小精悍的論著起首作者便把民族主義文藝與時代的關係用很緊凑的筆緻加以解說其次是論到關於創作的理論有幾點實有獨到的見地文藝創作所着重的當然是人物的刻畫藝術的表現關於此作者所述是非常的詳盡例如</p>
<p>民族主義文藝創作中的人型决不是頽廢的詩人墮落的性情却是能夠爲民族爭光的有志氣的人一個立志於創作的人平素以自已的觀察力向各方面放射而拿來表現在創作裏則當然無錯點可找其實我們幸而生長在這個時代的底下我們就决不缺少機會來找尋幾個値得描寫的個性向積極一方面說應有努力於民族運動的人有爲民族爭光用盡自已精神及犧牲自已軀體的人向消極一方面說也有一些始而墮落繼而長進的人有始而彷徨繼而覺悟的人總之要刻畫個性則一切直接間接與民族有關係的全可作爲描寫時的典型</p>
<p>以下還有兩節作者所論尤爲詳細因爲篇幅關係未能加以徴引不過看了上面一節我們已可明瞭民族主義文藝的創作應該怎樣的描寫更其是人物觀點的刻畫同時作者將此項創作應採取的題材也有論及</p>
<p>劉元釗的（流水）是一詩含有象徴力的詩充滿着民族的中心意讖在藝術上也可說是取得相當成就毎一句一字都有促使我們向上奮鬥的毅力</p>
<p>艱難不屈底流水</p>
<p>跋涉地奔走</p>
<p>淙淙地潺潺地</p>
<p>想得到一個征程底盡頭</p>
<p>志不可拔的流水</p>
<p>努力地奮鬥</p>
<p>滾滾地轟轟地</p>
<p>早顧那凱旋之歌高奏</p>
<p>黃奐若的（悲壯的一杯）是一篇民族主義文藝的力作俟登完後再加批判吳希玲的（女詩人散記）是一篇詩意的日記體的散文對於民族主義文藝的理論亦所有發揮這種體裁的文字使我們看了感到無上的輕快可喜　材的（黃昏細雨曲）是更寫得精美而有力了</p>

<h3>Domestic Important Telegrams</h3>
<p>Yang Hucheng Directs Troops Towards Xi'an; Vanguard Reaches Huayue Temple</p>
<p>Hankou Military News: Yang Hucheng's vanguard army, the 26th division, launched an attack from Tongguan towards Huayin. On the 27th, Yang Hucheng inspected the front lines by plane and returned to Lingbao to oversee the westward advance of the troops. Liu Maoen's forces have already arrived in Xinan from Luo, and are expected to reach the Guanzhong area within three months. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Hankou: A telegram from the 7th Army Staff Office on the 27th states that Yang Hucheng arrived at the Guanzhong area on the 26th to inspect and command the troops to directly take Xi'an. The vanguard has already reached Huayue Temple. Xiao Zhichu's entire force has arrived in Mianchi, and Ge Yunlong's troops are departing from Ziyou County. Gu Zhutong and Chen Jicheng's two divisions are stationed in Luoyang for defense. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Lu Zhonglin Leaves Jiaozuo</h3>
<p>Has Already Arrived in Tianjin in Disguise</p>
<p>Tianjin: Zhang Xueliang intends to abolish the Northwestern Army division commanders and army commanders north of the Yellow River and reorganize them into brigades under the command of the Northeast Army. Lu Zhonglin disagreed, so he issued a telegram resigning and sent Qin Decun to Liaoning to explain everything. On the 24th, Lu left Jiaozuo and traveled north in disguise, arriving in Tianjin on the 26th. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Kaifeng: The original text of Lu Zhonglin's resignation telegram is as follows: "To all newspaper offices, please be aware that in recent years, the country has been plagued by misfortune and turmoil. Zhonglin has mistakenly taken on the difficult task of saving the day, but I have been unable to assist. I examine myself and feel deeply guilty. Furthermore, I have suffered from a chronic stomach illness for many years, and this year, from summer to autumn, my suffering has intensified. I urgently need to find a place for medical treatment in order to recover as soon as possible. I will immediately resign from my military post and seek rest and recuperation in the forests and springs, returning to my original state. In the years to come, I will dedicate my life to serving the country. My sincere heart hopes that all wise people, comrades, and colleagues will understand. I respectfully send this telegram and pray for your forgiveness. Lu Zhonglin, bowing." (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Jin Army Has No Will to Fight</h3>
<p>Wang Decides to Go Abroad</p>
<p>Beiping: Correspondents from Bingzhou report that Yan Xishan initially intended to defend the areas west of Chaigoubao and place Suiyuan as a garrison area for the Jin Army. However, due to the uprising of local armies in Suiyuan against this plan, they withdrew. The Jin Army also has no will to fight, so it is practically impossible to maintain the situation. They have no choice but to retreat from Suiyuan again and temporarily defend Yanmen Pass. Furthermore, there are reports that the Shaanxi Red Spear Society militia groups are rising up and creating difficulties for Feng Yuxiang's troops, avenging the seizure of food from the people by the soldiers. This is the reason for Liu Yufen and Song Zheyuan's retreat. The people of Shaanxi welcome Yang Hucheng because Feng Yuxiang's troops were excessively demanding. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Beiping: A certain important figure from Bingzhou said that Wang Jingwei has decided to go abroad, but the route has not been determined. If it is safe to go via Beiping and Tianjin, he will depart immediately; otherwise, he will travel north. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Beiping: After Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan step down and go abroad, Shang Zhen will handle the aftermath of the Jin Army. The Northwest Army must be divided and reorganized individually. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Liu Zhenhua Arrives in Tianjin Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tianjin: Liu Zhenhua's special train arrived in Tianjin at 2:30 AM on the 27th. In the evening, he hosted a grand banquet for relatives and friends at his residence. According to his secretary-general, Chen Ciyuan, Liu's three divisions and two brigades are all in the areas of Shanzhou and Lingbao in Shaanxi. The central government intends to appoint him as the Director of Local Affairs for Henan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi. He will go to Henan to oversee the director's office as soon as the order is issued. The office will be located in Luoyang. Liu will stay in Tianjin for a short time. (Special telegram, Tianjin, 27th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Liu Zhenhua told reporters on the evening of the 27th that he had traveled to more than ten countries in Europe and America and was amazed by the speed of their progress. Compared to China, there is a difference of four to five hundred years. After returning to China, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek instructed him to handle the aftermath in the three provinces of Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi. He does not wish to hold an official position but desires to develop the economic interests of the Northwest. He plans to have the Longhai Railway extended to Xi'an within a year and then to Gansu. He will also send experts to investigate planting and animal husbandry according to local conditions. If the government is unable to do so, he will gather capitalists to do it. Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang are in a desperate situation. If they stubbornly refuse to leave, the consequences will not be good. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Liu Zhenhua sent a telegram to his residence in Beiping today, stating that he would not stay in Beiping and Tianjin for long and would go to Henan immediately. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Liu Zhenhua advocates reorganizing Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang's troops, counting those with guns as one unit. A broadsword is not a firearm. Feng Yuxiang's troops currently have less than 40,000 guns, and Yan Xishan's troops have less than 60,000 guns. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Han Fuju telegraphed Yu Xuezhong on the 26th, stating that Chief Commander Liu Zhenhua had been ordered to go to Tianjin and took a special train north on the 26th. He requested that Yu ensure safe passage along the way and not obstruct him. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Soviet Detective Team</p>
<h3>Ambushed and Attacked by Bandits</h3>
<p>Three Detectives Killed</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: More than 40 members of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau's detective team were lured by bandits to the reeds near the Longmenkou west of the station on the morning of the 27th, under the pretext of rescuing a kidnapped person. More than 100 bandits surrounded and attacked them, killing detective team leader Ma Shirliang and three detectives. The team retreated to the Mulberry Improvement Association in Sibaidu and reported to Bureau Chief Chen Fuli, who dispatched cavalry patrols and security teams led by Inspector Xu to encircle and suppress the bandits from different directions. The bandits fought as they retreated, escaping by boat to the north of the Yangtze River, with some saying they fled into the mountains. The teams returned in the evening. The three who died in the line of duty have been buried separately. The bandits also suffered casualties. Four suspects have been arrested and are being held in the bureau. Bureau Chief Chen has reported to the Civil Affairs Department requesting troops to suppress the bandits. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>Hankou: Chiang and Cai's two divisions have all arrived in Hubei by the 27th. Chiang's troops will take over the defense of the Wuhan-Changsha Railway, and Cai's troops will take over the defense of Xin'di and Chenglingji. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>

(Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Changsha: Cheng Tiexia's troops were deployed to the province for inspection. The Shun Sheng warship set sail for Yuezhou. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Lu Xingbang telegraphed, requesting</p>
<h3>Cessation of Military Operations</h3>
<p>The Five Provincial Representatives Have Been Sent to the Province from Yanping</p>
<p>Fuzhou: All six provincial representatives, except for Chen Naiyuan, who died of illness in Youxi, are safe. They have been handed over to Sun Benrong and sent to the province from Yanping. They are expected to arrive today. The provincial government has sent Yang Guangxun to Huangtian to take care of them. Lu Xingbang also sent a long telegram to the provincial government stating that Lu Xingming was not involved in the June 1st Incident and that Lu Xingrong had been dismissed and was awaiting punishment. He requested a cessation of military operations. The provincial government replied immediately, stating that troops would be withdrawn immediately and the matter would be reported to the central government for approval. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Xiamen: The central army's entry into Fujian has led to changes in downstream military operations. The attack on Datian has been halted, and the frontline troops have been withdrawn. The entire New Third Division has returned to Zhangzhou. One regiment, led by Wang Zuqing, withdrew from Dehua on the 27th and returned to Zhangzhou via Yongchun and Quanzhou. The Fourth Regiment, led by Huang Kesheng, concentrated on guarding the coast and returned to Zhangzhou. Quanzhou was taken over by the training regiment. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>

<h3>Current Affairs Commentary</h3>
<p>Recent News on European and American Political Situations</p>
<p>Regarding the political situations in European and American countries, the visible current state is that although the results of the German election are unfavorable to the government, they are favorable within the parliament, so the political situation can be temporarily stabilized. The victory of the Socialist Party in the French municipal elections is clearly unfavorable to the government. In the Austrian elections, eleven political parties competed, and although the Social Democratic Party lost slightly, it still holds a dominant position among the parties. The American parliamentary elections are about to be held, and both the Republican and Democratic parties are actively preparing for competition. Republicans believe that based on the initial voting results, the Republican Party may lose thirty-two seats in the House of Representatives, but it can still control the power of the House. The number of its seats in the Senate will also be three to seven seats. From this, it can be seen that the party of government in European and American countries has generally decreased slightly compared to before, but it can still maintain its advantage in parliament. Although the results of its administration are not satisfactory to the people, they are not yet hated by them. Because the people suffer from the pain of the world's commercial decline, there are many who complain about the government, but they also know that the source of this pain cannot be easily resolved by a political party in power. Therefore, although people are dissatisfied, they are not yet resolutely disgusted. European and American governments are like this, and so are other continents. Domestic Important Telegrams Two.</p>

Not only is the public's concept and belief in the party very weak, but the party members themselves are scattered due to the oppression and destruction by warlords and reactionaries. The effectiveness of the propaganda of doctrines and the leadership of politics is almost zero. In particular, the party members are divided into different factions, and the members are complex. Small organizations are constantly being discovered, and they take the opportunity to engage in activities for personal and factional rights whenever there is a slight change in the political situation, not hesitating to be tools of warlords and reactionaries, leaving the doctrines, leaving the party, and leaving the people, so that the party's foundation cannot be consolidated and political construction cannot be carried out. In short, there is no party rule at all in North China. It is just that ambitious warlords use the party's signboard to recruit various factions and deceive the general public in order to serve their private interests in seizing power. Yan Xishan's betrayal this time is outrageous, and the number of things he has done is countless. He has arbitrarily arrested loyal comrades of our party in the north, used all kinds of extremely cruel tortures to kill them, and falsely accused them of being communists to deceive people. After killing them, he did not allow coffins to be buried and the corpses were exposed, which was unbearable to witness. There are quite a few party comrades who have suffered this fate, which still needs to be investigated later. What is even more ridiculous is that when the rebellion occurred, he colluded with the remnants of warlords and bandits from all over the country to create disturbances, and he openly sent representatives to urge Prince Gong of the Qing Dynasty, giving him 500,000 yuan to recruit bandits in eastern Shandong to respond to him. This was something that previous warlords were unwilling to do, but he brazenly did it. His昏闇悖妄 is beyond description. As for Wang Jingwei, after arriving in the north, he colluded with Yan and Feng, not hesitating to act as an accomplice. All kinds of tricks he played are signs of his demise. His instigation of Zhang Fakui and Zhu Mao Peng He and other communist leaders to disturb Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi and plot to seize Wuhan has been discovered, and there is conclusive evidence that will surely be exposed to the public in the future. He believes that the victory of this anti-rebellion lies in the struggle and sacrifice of the generals and soldiers, and the biggest reason is actually related to the support of the public. Therefore, psychological construction is the fundamental. He hopes that all party comrades will be united in their loyalty in the future. If they continue to follow the old ways of small organizations and do not seek overall progress for the sake of doctrines, then the party's future will still be difficult to be optimistic. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 a.m. At 10:00 a.m. on the same day, the National Government held a General Memorial Week, attended by Zhu Peide, Ma Fuxiang, He Yaozu, Yi Peiji, Jiang Menglin, Zhang Nanxian, Lin Xiang, Chen Yi, Chen Yu, Zhou Yawei, Zhang Wohua, Wu Siyu, Zhang Xiqian, and staff from the National Government's civil affairs and military affairs offices, a total of more than 200 people. After Chairman Zhu Peide presided over the ceremony, Secretary Qian Changzhao made the following political report: Political reform is an urgent matter after the end of the military operations, and political reform will surely be more effective when the prestige of the central government is established. This is something that everyone knows. The soldiers at the front line sacrificed everything this time, and the people of the whole country suffered great losses directly and indirectly, in order to eliminate Yan and Feng and create an excellent opportunity for political reform. We should make special efforts, otherwise, we will not be able to face the soldiers at the front line, and we will not be able to face the people of the whole country. Today, the five most important measures are briefly analyzed in terms of both positive and negative aspects as announced by Chairman Chiang on National Day. (1) Suppressing the bandits and communists. The suppression of the bandits and communists is negative, and how to consolidate the shaken social foundation in the places that have been occupied by the bandits and communists is positive. (2) Reforming finance. Removing accumulated malpractices and abolishing exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies are negative, and various plans to increase revenue are positive. (3) Purifying the officialdom. Severely punishing corruption is negative, and concentrating talents in the officialdom is positive. (4) Developing the economy. Preventing foreign economic aggression and reducing labor-capital disputes are negative, and promoting transportation, water conservancy, agriculture, mining, and other enterprises is positive. (5) Promoting local self-government. Eliminating the evil and corrupt forces in the localities is negative, and completing the organization of self-government and enriching the foundation of self-government is positive. What has been said above regarding the work on the negative side is what the people of the whole country most urgently desire, and the government's strength is also the easiest to express. In fact, the work on the negative side cannot be done well, and the work on the positive side is very difficult to carry out, because we know that if the bandits and communists are not suppressed, there is no way to talk about consolidating the social foundation. If the accumulated malpractices in finance are not removed and the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies are not abolished, there is no way to increase revenue. If corruption is not severely punished, there is no way to concentrate the talents of the officialdom. If foreign economic aggression is not prevented and labor-capital disputes are not reduced, it is not easy for all domestic enterprises to develop. If the evil and corrupt forces in the localities are not eliminated, the organization of self-government will not be completed and the foundation will not be enriched. Therefore, we must carry out the work on the negative side immediately, but we must make a determination to do it in a bold and decisive manner. We can definitely achieve results in the shortest possible time. As for the work on the positive side, it is of course more complicated than the negative side. First, we need talents, and second, we need funding. First, let's talk about talents. Our country really lacks specialized talents, especially technical talents. To give two examples, aviation is very important, but there are only a few talents in the whole country who have research on aircraft manufacturing. Shipbuilding is very important, but there are only a few talents in the whole country who have shipbuilding knowledge and experience. We have never stopped thinking about catching up with the material civilization of the West, but looking back at our own scientific foundation, we always feel that it is too shallow. Even if there are some outstanding talents, they do not necessarily have the opportunity to use what they have learned, and they often flow into negative activities. The young people who are still being cultivated in general schools are also facing very dangerous futures because the education is not perfect and the academic style is bad. In short, the talent panic in our country now and in the future is visible and predictable, and we must find ways to remedy it. Second, let's talk about funding. Our country's finances are difficult and the debt is high. Even if we strictly implement austerity policies, it is not easy to make the national treasury immediately sufficient. There are many places to consider and be cautious about absorbing foreign investment. Since the situation of talents and funding is like this, how should we carry out the work on the positive side of political reform at this time? Brother believes that we can only work as much as possible within the possible scope, do as much as we can with one point of effort, and never put on a show or hang up empty signs. Whether or not any political facilities have results does not depend on the size or number of agencies, but on the efficiency. The increase in political efficiency is of course due to the efforts of the people of the whole country. In addition to concentrating talents and funding, the government should also pay attention to improving the system to make it less focused on ideals and less accommodating to reality. The administrative system should be orderly to prevent duplication or conflict, and the spirit of the rule of law should be promoted. The so-called credibility and punishment must be careful. If we can gather our strength and make progress step by step, we believe that politics can be on the right track, the people's livelihood problems can be solved, and our country can survive safely and without fear in this world where the superior wins and the inferior is eliminated.</p>
<h3>The Grand Occasion of the Victory Celebration in Hankou</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence The celebration of the victory over the rebels and the welcoming of the triumphant soldiers by all circles in Hankou was held at Zhongshan Park at 10:00 a.m. on the 25th. The grand occasion of the meeting is described as follows: The meeting place was arranged in the Zhongshan Park Sports Ground. The rostrum was in the middle, and the band was on the left. The surrounding area of the venue was maintained by the Gendarmerie Corps, the Security Brigade, and the Boy Scouts. Flags were fluttering all over the park, reflecting the fragrant chrysanthemum hedges. Airplanes circled in the air, scattering colorful slogans. The weather gradually cleared from cloudy, and finally the sunlight shone brightly and was extremely warm. The important figures who attended the meeting that day included Generals He Chengjun, Xia Douyin, and Xu Yuanquan. The presidium was composed of Xiao Ruoxu, Liu Yun, Pang Jingtang (Municipal Party Department), Liu Wendao (Municipal Government), Mo Zicai (Pinghan Railway Special Party Department), Li Jihong (Financial Commissioner's Office), Xuan Jieshi (Wuhan Headquarters), Ye Peng (Garrison Department), Gao Bochang, and Huang Wenzhi (General Chamber of Commerce). In addition, Wang Yiqun, Qiu Hongjun, Ouyang Zhen, Yang Zaichun, Wu Guozhen, and representatives from various party departments, people's organizations, government agencies, and schools, totaling approximately 100,000 people, participated, which was a very grand occasion for a while. The meeting was originally scheduled to open at 10:00 a.m. Because He Chengjun was answering a visit from the American consul in Hankou at that time and would not be finished until 12:00 p.m., Liu Wendao explained the reason for the delay to the meeting, and Wang Yiqun, Li Jihong, and Huang Wenzhi were publicly elected to go by car to welcome the triumphant generals, hoping that the three commanders He, Xu, and Xia could come to meet the expectations of the crowd. Later, it was heard that Dai Ji, deputy commander of the 61st Division, had arrived in Hankou in the morning at the General Chamber of Commerce, so representatives were sent to welcome him. At about 12:00 p.m., the crowd craned their necks and waited. Suddenly, they heard the sound of military music and the sound of soldiers and police raising their guns. It was only then that they knew that Commander Xia Douyin had arrived. Before long, Deputy Commander Dai Ji, Acting Director He Chengjun, and Commander Xu Yuanquan all came in light vehicles. The atmosphere at the meeting was suddenly solemn, and the command personnel also worked unusually hard. The meeting was immediately held according to the ceremony. After Chairman Liu Yun respectfully read the will, Liu Wendao first reported the reason for the meeting, followed by He Chengjun's speech, which stated briefly that his brothers had returned from the front line not long ago. Today, he was grateful for the welcome from all circles and thanked all the armed comrades on behalf of the entire armed comrades. He also took this opportunity to report to all the people on the process of suppressing the rebellion. At the beginning of Yan Feng's rebellion, people generally thought that the rebels were strong and the central army was afraid of being unsure, especially the mixed troops and bandits who echoed the rebels to strengthen their false voices. However, our armed comrades put the country first, regardless of any difficulties or dangers, and fought forward. Finally, because of the unity of the people, Yan Feng was defeated. The only point of victory in this is that our armed comrades understood the doctrines of our party. Therefore, the victory of this war is actually the victory of the doctrines. Now the war has come to an end, but Yan Feng has not yet gone abroad, and the roots have not been eradicated. It is inevitable that the embers will rekindle. After the central army recovered Zhengzhou, it originally planned to take advantage of the victory to cross the river and directly attack the rebel nest and capture Shaanxi, Gansu, and Shanxi provinces, but the important thing was to pacify the rear, so it had to return to Hankou. Although it felt regrettable to miss this opportunity, it was believed that the final victory was absolutely no problem. Today, it is reported that the remnants of Yan Feng have no possibility of existence, and the central government has sent people to clean them up. The central government originally aimed at peaceful reunification, and the use of force this time was not forced. They were disregarding the country for the sake of leadership desires. For example, after Yan succeeded in the Northern Expedition,</p>
<p>He controlled the territory of four provinces alone. At that time, the military strength of Shanxi Province was less than nine divisions, and the financial income was self-sufficient. How could it not be enough, and he even asked the central government for more than 20 million yuan in military expenses to expand his reactionary forces and cultivate his personal strength. As for Feng, the people in Shaanxi and Gansu were not able to live in peace and contentment. Starving people were everywhere, and the relief food that was transported from outside was also deducted by Feng. It can be said that he had no popular support. Even those who sold their sons and daughters had to pay taxes. The people in the places where Feng's army went were burdened with more layers of burdens and suffering. Brothers heard in Xuchang and Linying that the people were exploited by Feng Ni, and their food and clothing were exhausted. At this time, the war in the east was fierce, and we did not take a defensive posture. We witnessed the cruel behavior of the people being cruelly treated by bandits, and we could not bear it. If such generations are not eliminated, the country's future will not be easy to handle. Therefore, our armed comrades believe that defeating Yan Feng is to eliminate the danger of the people of the whole country, and they are determined to fundamentally eliminate these demons and prevent the production of Yan Feng's similar figures, so as not to harm our compatriots. When our army first fought, the number of people was not as large as the enemy's. As Mayor Liu said, fortunately Commander-in-Chief Chiang used his troops quickly and planned carefully, and relied on the officers and soldiers to fight for the doctrines, so as to achieve the final victory. During the Northern Expedition, the people sincerely welcomed the revolutionary army. This time, the people's attitude towards welcoming the revolutionary army was not as good as before. I hope that the party affairs comrades will work hard to publicize to the people so that the people can understand the party's doctrines and seek happiness for the country. After the armed comrades win the victory, they must not be proud and must strictly abide by discipline. Starting today, please pay special attention. Next, Xu Yuanquan gave a speech, which stated briefly that today, all circles in Hankou welcomed the triumphant soldiers, and the brothers were ashamed to be in such a grand event. Mayor Liu and Commander He had said very clearly just now that Yan Feng dared to resist the central government and called for war. The central government decided to eliminate them so that the rebels could not exist. In less than a few months, most of them had been eliminated. Yuanquan was ordered to lead his troops back to Hubei to clear the countryside and suppress bandits, but his heart was full of fear because he was not familiar with the situation in his hometown and the troops had been fighting for a long time, so he was afraid that there would be some shortcomings. In the future, he will only follow the orders of Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Commander He to work hard. Next, Xia Douyin gave a speech, which stated briefly that today Douyin was grateful for the grand welcome from everyone, and his heart was extremely ashamed because the victory of this war was the victory of the doctrines. The brothers belong to the military and it is their duty to defend the country and save the people. As for this time, they were ordered to return to the army, and they had already decided to eliminate the bandits and communists in the Yangtze River area to thank everyone's kindness. Then, the meeting passed the following four proposals on the spot: (1) Telegraph Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Deputy Commander Zhang to thoroughly eliminate the remaining rebels. (2) Telegraph the central government to thoroughly eliminate the bandits and communists in the shortest possible time. (3) Petition the central government to continue to implement the reorganization and disarmament. (4) Send a telegram to support Chairman Chiang's five claims. After the proposals were passed, Chairman Liu Wendao led the cheers and slogans and started the parade according to the predetermined route. In the afternoon, there was a performance to celebrate (26th).</p>
<h3>Chen Bulei Goes to Fenghua to Visit Chiang, Chiang Sends a Telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department That He Cannot Come to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>After Chairman Chiang passed through Ningbo on the 25th and returned to his hometown, he inspected the Wuling School Kindergarten and went to Yulin'ao to pay respects at his mother's tomb. In recent days, due to the fatigue of the journey and the fact that this return to his hometown was purely for recuperation, he refused to meet all guests except relatives, clan members, and neighbors unless there were very important matters. The people of Xikou began to perform operas on the 26th, and a welcome meeting was held at 1:00 p.m. on the 27th. Chen Bulei, Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, passed through Shaoxing from Hangzhou this morning (27th) and arrived in Ningbo at about 4:00 p.m. He immediately took a car to Fenghua Xikou to visit Chairman Chiang, personally presented important public affairs, and welcomed Chiang on behalf of the provincial authorities to Hangzhou. However, the Provincial Party Department had telegraphed Chiang yesterday to welcome him to Hangzhou to pay his respects. Today, the Provincial Party Department received Chiang's reply declining, and he may not be able to come. The reply telegram is recorded as follows: Zhejiang Provincial Party Department, Honorary Admonition, The respectful telegram has been read and I respectfully thank you for your kindness. Zhongzheng has returned to his hometown to sweep the tombs and will need to stay for about ten days. At that time, he will have to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, so he is afraid that he will not be able to obey your request to go to the meeting this time.

<h3>Japanese Ship Xiangyang Maru Beats Passenger to Death</h3>
<h3>Ding Changming Was Beaten to Death for Not Having Money to Pay for Ticket, Murderer Liu Decai Has Been Sent to Court for Trial</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence Foreign ships are sailing in our country, invading our navigational rights and wantonly trampling on Chinese people. Although the government has repeatedly negotiated, there has been no satisfactory result. Unexpectedly, on the 26th, when the Japanese Qing Company's Xiangyang Maru, which was sailing downstream from Hankou, arrived in Wuhu, there was another case of a waiter beating a passenger to death.</p>
<p>The details of this case are described as follows: Ding Changming, a native of He County, Anhui Province, who was forty-five years old, sailed downstream from Hankou on the Japanese Qing Company's Xiangyang Maru with his nephew Zhang Bangchen a few days ago.</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>Continued Domestic News</p>
<p>Due to the limited travel expenses he brought,</p>
<p>Therefore, when boarding the ship, he only bought a third-class ticket. However, he paid an additional two yuan to waiter Qiao Ageng of No. 13 to secure a berth in the third-class cabin, agreeing to disembark in Wuhu. After the ship passed Datong, the ticket inspector saw that Ding's ticket was for third class and immediately ordered him to pay for the ticket. Ding pleaded repeatedly because his travel funds had been exhausted, but the ticket inspector firmly refused. At that time, a waiter named Liu Decai suddenly used barbaric means and punched Ding hard, hitting the vital part of his ribs. He immediately fell to the ground and died. When Ding was beaten to death, passengers such as Zhao Yuzhuo, who were on the same ship, were very upset when they saw this and gathered together to negotiate with the shipowner. Unexpectedly, the shipowner ignored them. When the ship arrived in Wuhu, the local water patrol station heard about it and immediately sent officers to board the ship to investigate the truth. The local police station reported the details to Director Zhao of the Wuhu Municipal Public Security Bureau. After receiving the report, Director Zhao immediately sent medical officer Zheng Pengnian, inspector Wang Bingheng, etc. to investigate and handle the negotiations. At the same time, he also notified the local prosecutor's office to send officers to conduct an autopsy. According to the results of the examination by medical officer Zheng, the deceased had blood marks on his mouth, a very heavy injury to his left rib, and a fist wound to his right rib. The Public Security Bureau claimed that the matter involved human life and advocated a thorough investigation. It immediately ordered the ship to stop sailing and hand over the murderer for legal handling. At the same time, the Japanese consul stationed in Wuhu, Chiba Saki Shiro, also boarded the ship with Vice Consul Toyoshima Naka, Police Chief Nakani Kuye, and Director Iida Masataro of the East Asia Hospital to investigate. Unexpectedly, after the Japanese doctor's examination, he claimed that there were no injuries at all, which showed the cunning of the Japanese. After receiving the report, the Wuhu Local Court Prosecutor's Office also sent Prosecutor Deng Zhaoluan and clerks and police officers to conduct an autopsy at 3:00 p.m. After the autopsy, the shipowner Yamamoto Masao filled in the corpse form, prepared a coffin, and temporarily stopped the Osaka ship. The murderer Liu Decai was also arrested by the water patrol station and handed over to the court for detention. The ship was permitted by the Public Security Bureau after negotiating with the Japanese consul because passengers and cargo needed to be transported to downstream ports, and it left Wuhu downstream at 4:00 p.m. Zhang Bangchen, the deceased's nephew, was also sent to the inn by the water patrol station to wait for the matter to be resolved (26th).</p>
<h3>Increased Express Trains Between Jinan and Pukou</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Due to a shortage of train cars, the Jinan-Pukou special express trains Nos. 201 and 202 on the Jinpu Railway were reduced to running only twice a week (Wednesdays and Saturdays from Jinan to Pukou, arriving Thursdays and Sundays; Mondays and Thursdays from Pukou to Jinan, arriving Tuesdays and Fridays), causing severe overcrowding for passengers. Recently, with the military resolving the vehicle issue and cars being gradually returned to the line, it has been decided to increase the special express service by two additional trains each week in each direction, starting from the first of next month. The schedule will be as follows: Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays from Jinan to Pukou, arriving Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays; Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays from Pukou to Jinan, arriving Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays. The timetable will remain the same. (25th)</p>
<h3>Jinan-Qingdao Journalist Delegation Inspects Jiaoji Railway</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Jiaoji Railway Management Committee hosted a delegation of journalists from Jinan and Qingdao to inspect the war damage suffered by the railway. On the evening of the 22nd, the Jinan journalist delegation, consisting of twenty members, departed from Jinan at 11:00 PM on the Jiaoji Railway's first-class sleeper car No. 216, attached to a secondary train. They arrived in Qingdao at 9:00 AM on the 23rd, where the entire Qingdao press corps warmly welcomed them. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the Jiaoji Railway Bureau held a tea party to entertain journalists from both Jinan and Qingdao, hosted by Committee member Lu.</p>
<h3>Damage to the Zihe River Bridge on the Jiaoji Railway (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Mengxiong, Zhou Zhongqi, Cui Tiejie, Peng Dongyuan, and various section chiefs, factory directors, and department heads provided a welcoming reception. At 7:00 AM on the 24th, the journalists from Jinan and Qingdao (a delegation of sixteen from Qingdao) gathered at Qingdao Station and departed. Jiaoji Railway Committee member Lu Mengxiong led railway bureau staff to the station to see them off and took a group photo at the station as a memento. At 7:30 AM, they boarded the train, consisting of five cars pulled by locomotive No. 101. In front was the "Welcome Jinan and Qingdao Journalists Jiaoji Railway Inspection Delegation" flag, followed by guard car No. 742, first-class dining car No. 121, a first and second-class mixed car No. 214, and business car No. 8002. The train departed at 7:40 AM. West of Gaomi, as the area was not affected by the war, there was nothing to inspect, and the train did not stop along the way. At 10:00 AM, they arrived at Gaomi, where the Chief of the Third Maintenance Section of the Maintenance Department, Hu Zuoxi, Maintenance Officer Sun Buzhen, and Chief of the Second Traffic Section, Ma Langu, welcomed them at the station and took a group photo together. At 12:10 PM, they arrived at the Heqiao Bridge and disembarked to inspect the site. They observed that the bridge was a new-style steel plate bridge, with the tenth span destroyed by Jin forces. It was temporarily supported by wooden piles to allow traffic. The Chief of the Maintenance Department, Deng Yiguang, stated that the cost of repair materials would be six</p>
<h3>Damage to the Zihe River Bridge on the Jiaoji Railway (Part 2)</h3>
<p>thousand yuan, and the labor cost would be two thousand yuan. At 12:40 PM, they arrived at the Yunhe Bridge and disembarked to inspect the site. This bridge was also a new-style steel plate bridge, with the western end of the eighth span and the waist panel of the northern beam cracked by bombing from the Jin army. It was also temporarily supported by wooden piles to allow traffic. Deng Yiguang stated that the cost of labor and materials for repairs would also be seven or eight thousand yuan. At 3:30 PM, they arrived at the Daweihe River and disembarked to inspect the site. This bridge was an old bridge, with the bridge pier of the second span destroyed by Jin forces, and the third span also suffered collateral damage. It was also temporarily supported by wooden piles to allow traffic. In the future, it would need to be completely replaced with a new-style steel plate bridge, with labor and material costs estimated at over 20,000 yuan. While inspecting the three bridges, the journalists all took numerous photographs. From there westward, the Xiaodan River, Dadan River, Mihe River, and Baiyang River bridges were all scheduled for inspection, but due to the lateness of the hour, they were afraid they would not be able to inspect the most severely damaged and battle-scarred Zihe River Bridge and Niushan, so they did not disembark. As they approached the Zihe River Bridge, it was already 6:00 PM and the sky was dim. The journalists disembarked and inspected the bridge in the fading twilight. According to Deng Yiguang, from July 7th to the 26th, due to the fierce fighting between the Jin and Han Fuqu armies across the river, the bridge was hit by a total of twenty-eight artillery shells. On August 15th, when the Jin forces retreated, they bombed the second and ninth spans, causing the bridge body to sink by six or seven feet. It was temporarily supported by wooden piles to allow traffic. On the east bank of the Zihe River, there were over forty li of north-south trenches of the Han army, and on the west bank, there were over thirty li of trenches. During the fighting, the Jin army attacked from the forest on the west bank, while the Han army defended with artillery mounted on Niushan on the east bank, lasting over fifty days. Although the war is now over, the trenches and artillery emplacements, along with countless new graves and flickering will-o'-the-wisps in the fading twilight, still strike the eye. The intensity of the war disaster is truly regrettable. At 6:30 PM, they departed from the Zihe River Bridge. At this time, Liu Dide, Chief of the Fourth Traffic Section of the Jinan Railway, Wang Xun, Engineer of the Second General Maintenance Section, Qin Wenjin and Li Weijun, Assistant Engineers, Pang Shufa, Maintenance Officer, and Li Hongtai, Chief of the Third Traffic Section of Zhangdian, all arrived one after another to welcome them. At 11:30 PM, they arrived in Jinan. The Jinan journalists disembarked, and the Qingdao journalists stayed on the train. The Jiaoji Railway Jinan Station scheduled a banquet for the Qingdao journalist delegation at the Jiaoji Hotel early on the 25th. The Jinan journalists scheduled a banquet for the Qingdao journalists at the Dongxinglou at 6:00 PM that evening. The Qingdao journalists planned to tour the provincial capital, the Yellow River Bridge, Daming Lake, and other scenic spots on that day and return to Qingdao on the secondary train at 11:00 PM that night. (24th) Another correspondence: The Jiaoji Railway, due to the war along the line this year lasting for two months, causing bridge damage and suspension of commercial transport, suffered unprecedented losses. To clarify the true situation to all sectors, a special invitation was extended to journalists from Qingdao and Jinan to inspect the line. On the 24th, the railway provided a special train and dispatched Tan Shukui, Chief of the Traffic Department, Deng Yiguang, Chief of the Maintenance Department, and eight others as reception staff. The train departed westward at 7:50 AM. The Jinan journalist delegation had arrived in Qingdao on the morning of the 23rd, so they accompanied the Qingdao journalist delegation on the same train westward. Lu Mengxiong, a member of the Jiaoji Railway Management Committee, and others came to the station to see them off. The train stopped to inspect most of the damaged bridges along the way, and Deng Yiguang and the chiefs of various engineering sections explained the extent of the damage and the progress of repairs. It was not until 12:00 PM that night that they arrived at Jinan Station. Details of the inspection of each bridge are recorded below: (1) Weihe River Bridge: This bridge, located between Zuoshan and Huangqibao, is about 270 meters long and is one of the eight major bridges on the line. On August 9th, when the Jin army retreated westward, they destroyed one span at the western end with powerful explosives. The engineering team temporarily supported it by building a pile of sleepers to allow slow traffic. It is planned to purchase a new bridge to replace the bombed span, which will cost about 8,000 yuan. (2) Yunhe River Bridge: This bridge, located between Huangqibao and Nanliu, is about 240 meters long. When the Jin army retreated westward, they bombed the western end of the eighth span. It is also currently supported by wooden piles. Preparations are underway to commence work to replace the eighth span with a new bridge, which will cost about 25,000 yuan, as the damage is more severe than that of the Zihe River Bridge. (3) Daweihe River Bridge: The bombed area of this bridge is on the second bridge pier, so both the second and third spans suffered significant damage. It is currently supported by scaffolding for temporary traffic. It is said that the entire bridge will be replaced with a new bridge. (4) Xiaodan River and Dadan River Bridges: These two bridges are located between the Changle and Yaogou stations. Each was bombed in one span and suffered considerable damage. They are now supported by wooden scaffolding and are planned to be completely replaced with new bridges. (5) Mihe River Bridge: The ninth span west of the Jiajiafangzi station was severely bombed, and it was soon repaired with old materials. (6) Baitang River Bridge: The bridge pier west of the Qingzhou station was damaged by bombing and has been repaired. A new bridge is planned to be replaced next year. (7) Zihe River Bridge: This bridge, located between the Zihe and Xindian stations, is about 430 meters long and is the longest bridge on the line. It is also the weakest of the old bridges on the line and should have been rebuilt long ago, but it was delayed due to the large amount of funding required. During this war, the two armies fought across the river, and the bridge piers and spans were damaged in twenty-eight places by artillery shells. When the Jin army retreated westward, they bombed the second and ninth spans, causing the bridge body to sink and suffer severe damage. Although it is currently supported by wooden scaffolding to allow traffic, the damage is too severe and dangerous. Replacing the bridge with a new one will require a large amount of funding and will have to be postponed for one or two years. It is reported that the total repair cost for the various bridges on the line will be 580,000 yuan, and the repair cost for various utility poles and wires will be over 20,000 yuan. The railway also suffered significant business losses during this military period, with a total reduction of 2,030,000 yuan in revenue from April to August. During this period, commercial transport was completely suspended, and all vehicles were almost entirely used for military transport. There are still over 518 railway cars that were requisitioned. The impact on business is self-evident. (Our reporter stationed in Qingdao filed from Jinan)</p>
<h3>Communist Organization Busted in Xiamen, Three Key Figures Executed</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The prison riot in Siming County on May 25th and the robbery of the Salt Bureau on July 25th were both secretly orchestrated by communists. Following a secret order from the Zhangxia Garrison Command to the Siming County Government Detective Team and the Public Security Bureau Detective Team to conduct a thorough investigation, He Xinjun, commander of the Second Guard Battalion stationed in Xiamen, reported on the 17th of this month that a deserter from his battalion, Lu Sibin, was being used by the communists to engage in activities in Xiamen. A team was dispatched to capture Lu at the Fuju Hotel in Liaozihou. According to Lu, he was deceived into joining the Communist Party and revealed the organization and key accomplices.

The situation after the Jin army's retreat is not very clear. The First Cavalry Brigade of the Second Army has reached Shunde. Shi Yousan's troops have not advanced north due to the destruction of the Shahe Bridge. The bridge can be repaired tomorrow. The Fifth Infantry Brigade of the First Army on the Ping Sui Railway is still in Kangzhuang and may be stationed in Zhangjiakou in the future. After the reporters left, Yu Xuezhong received foreign reporters and made similar remarks. (21st)</p>
<h3>Ford Airplane Arrives in Tianjin from Shenyang</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Henry Ford, the American automobile magnate, possesses a creative and persistent spirit, and his business is constantly advancing. He is now the wealthiest man in America. The Ford factory has produced 27 million automobiles. Recently, he has also manufactured tillage and road-repair machines as well as airplanes and airships. After the Sino-American aviation contract was signed, Mr. Ford, recognizing that the air route had not yet reached North China, and to promote Chinese interest in aviation, dispatched Ford airplane No. 406 to China. In May of this year, it was transported on wheels by pilot Peller to Japan, where it flew more than ten times. In August, it flew from Tokyo to Shenyang. Zhang Xueliang once took a trial flight and was very satisfied. Peller came to Tianjin on the 15th of this month to survey the British racecourse as a landing field and returned to Shenyang on the 16th. He flew to Tianjin on the 22nd. Zhang Xueliang also telegraphed provincial and municipal authorities to instruct them to protect it. On the morning of the 22nd, upon hearing the news of its arrival, no fewer than two hundred British and American ladies in Tianjin came to the racecourse to welcome it, while the number of Chinese was relatively small. At 1:05 PM, the Ford airplane arrived, circled the racecourse once, and then slowly descended. Zhang Xueliang sent British advisor Eigner and adjutant Zhu Bo to escort it on the plane. According to Peller's interview with reporters, (This is a commercial plane, entirely made of steel, with three engines and 900 horsepower. It has a carrying capacity of 4,600 pounds, carrying thirteen passengers and two pilots. Luggage is attached to both wings. It travels 135 miles per hour and needs to refuel every 510 miles. The wings are 75 feet wide, and the body is 50 feet long. The flying altitude is 1,700 feet. The cockpit has a compass and a map with lines of longitude and latitude. After flying for a certain amount of time, one knows where one has arrived without having to use rivers or railways as a target. Today, it took off from the Northeast airfield at 9:40 AM, passed through Shanhaiguan, and soared over the Great Wall for more than twenty minutes before entering the pass. The weather was excellent today. The airplane is scheduled to be opened to the public for viewing by all circles, Chinese and foreign, at 3:00 PM tomorrow. It is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 25th. It was originally intended to fly to Hankou, but it was canceled due to the instability there. Whether it will fly to Guangdong or Southeast Asia after arriving in Shanghai has not been decided yet.) (October 22nd)</p>
<h3>Northeast Military and Political News</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: In order to consolidate security in Pingjin and maintain military discipline, Chen Xingya, commander of the Northeast Military Police, was ordered by the authorities to transfer all of the 3rd and 4th Battalions of the Military Police stationed in Liaoning, as well as a section of the detective division, to Pingjin. Liu Jingyao, commander of the 3rd Battalion, led the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th Companies under his command, and Fu Changrui, commander of the 4th Battalion, led the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th Companies. Chen Ying, commander of the 1st Battalion of the Detective Division, led his 40 members, departed for Pingjin at 6:00 PM on the 18th on twenty vehicles on the Beining Railway. Commander Chen Xingya led Lei Hengcheng, chief of the detective division, Cheng Guangdao, adjutant general, and accompanying military police to Pingjin on the 19th to make arrangements. The affairs of the Shenyang Military Police Headquarters were entrusted to Major General Li to act on his behalf. It is reported that after the deployment of the military police in Pingjin is settled, Chen will return to Shenyang, while Lei will remain in Pingjin to take charge of detective affairs. Xing'an Reclamation Director Zhang Zuohua was originally also serving concurrently as commander of the Northeast Artillery and artillery training supervisor. Recently, Zhang resigned from his concurrent posts due to focusing on reclamation work. Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Zuoxiang, and Wan Fulin have agreed to appoint Jin Jingqing, former commander of the Northeast Artillery 1st Brigade, to succeed him as commander of the artillery. Chen Guanqun, chief of staff of the Pingjin Garrison Headquarters, has been appointed as commander of the 23rd Brigade by the authorities to fill the vacancy left by Ma Tingfu. Since Ma Tingfu was dismissed from his position as commander of the 23rd Brigade, the position was concurrently held by Yu Xuezhong. Now that Yu has taken office as commander of the Pingjin Garrison, he cannot attend to both positions, so he recommended Chen to fill the position. Liu Zhonggan, chief of the Second Division of the Border Defense Military Affairs Department, has been appointed to succeed Chen as chief of staff. Zhang Xueliang considers the defenses of the Shanhaiguan area to be important. The position of Luan Yu Garrison Commander, which was held by Yu Xuezhong before he moved to Beiping, has not yet been filled. On the 18th, Ji Jinchun, senior advisor to the Border Defense Department, was appointed as Shanhaiguan Garrison Commander. The organization of the Pingjin Garrison Headquarters has recently been drafted by the Military Affairs Department of the Border Defense Department. It is composed of eight sections, similar to the organization of the Jilin-Heilongjiang Border Defense Deputy Commander's Office. All section chiefs will be colonels, except for the chief of the General Staff Department, who will be a major general. The officers of each section will be assigned from the personnel of the original eight sections of the Jin Yuguan Garrison Headquarters. The monthly budget for the headquarters is set at 25,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Zhao Heiyu Sentenced to Life Imprisonment: The bandit Zhao Heiyu was captured by Xu Fengshan, the detective chief of the Third District of the Suzhou Water Public Security Bureau, at the Xin Su Tai Hotel in Shanghai in March of last year. The Wu County District Court brought him to Suzhou for a hearing and investigation. It was confirmed that Zhao Heiyu had committed a series of major cases of murder and kidnapping, so he was prosecuted under the Bandit Suppression Regulations. The Criminal Court of the same court summoned witnesses for repeated hearings. Yesterday (27th) afternoon at 4:00 PM, Judge Xiao brought Zhao in for sentencing, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Sun Liansheng Parricide Case Appealed to Shanghai: Sun Laowu, a native of Nantong, who resided in the Qujia area of Zhabei, Shanghai, was murdered in July of this year by his adopted son Sun Liansheng in collusion with Ji Shuangquan, Qiu Shuntao, Qiu Lansheng, and others, using multiple knives. The case was adjudicated by the Shanghai District Court on the 8th of this month, and Sun Liansheng and Ji Shuangquan were each sentenced to death, Qiu Shuntao was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Qiu Lansheng was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. Upon receiving the verdict, the defendants declared their dissatisfaction and were required to appeal to the High Court. The sentence for Sun Liansheng and others was delivered on the previous day and immediately appealed to the High Court. Yesterday, the Shanghai District Court ordered a bailiff to prepare documents, along with the case files, and escort the four defendants, Sun Liansheng, Ji Shuangquan, Qiu Shuntao, and Qiu Lansheng, to Suzhou for detention at the High Court. They were immediately sent to the Siqian Street Detention Center to await a scheduled hearing. Chen Yiyi Escorted to Nanjing for Execution: Chen Yiyi, the former Mexican consul, was sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment by the Second Instance of the High Court for forging passports. Further investigation revealed that Chen had engaged in bribery, and the Jiangning District Court sentenced him to six months of imprisonment. Chen immediately applied for the cases to be executed concurrently, but the request was denied. He must first be escorted to the Jiangning District Court to serve the sentence for bribery, and then serve the sentence for forging passports. Therefore, yesterday (27th), the Jiangning District Court sent police to Suzhou to escort Chen Yiyi back to Jiangning for execution. Sun Zuji Case Opened for Investigation: Sun Zuji, the former county magistrate of Wuxi County, was accused of colluding to release a large number of detainees before his transfer of duty. Local people, including Zhang Tong, Yang Chongyuan, and Yang Suwu, learned of this and immediately filed a complaint with the Ministry of Justice, the Provincial Government, the High Court, and other superior organizations. After receiving the complaint, the Ministry of Justice, considering the bribery and release of detainees to be a serious matter, ordered the High Court to investigate thoroughly. Upon receiving the order, the High Court immediately forwarded it to the Wu County District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and handling. Yesterday (27th) afternoon, the Wu County District Prosecutor's Office opened a court for investigation. The plaintiffs and defendants were summoned to court in advance. Those who reported to the court included the plaintiffs Zhang Tong, Yang Chongyuan, and Yang Suwu, and others. The defendant, Sun Zuji, did not arrive and entrusted his younger brother, Sun Zu, to represent him as a lawyer. At 3:30 PM, Prosecutor Zhong Lunong opened the court for investigation. First, the plaintiffs were questioned one by one, and then the defendant's representative, Sun Zu, was questioned. The judge stated that the case was of great importance and that as a lawyer, he should be familiar with the law. A criminal defendant could not entrust a representative, so he ordered him to withdraw and wait for the defendant Sun Zuji to be summoned for another hearing. Return of Xu Lijang's House: During the initial arrival of the revolutionary army in Suzhou, the former municipal party headquarters sealed up a house belonging to Xu Lijang in front of the County Office. Subsequently, it was designated as the meeting place for the Chamber of Commerce. Xu's wife, Zhang, repeatedly petitioned the Provincial Party Headquarters, stating that the house should be returned. The request was delayed for a long time without approval. The Wu County Party Headquarters received an order from the Provincial Party Headquarters yesterday (27th), approving the return of the house to the custody of Xu and Zhang.</p>

However, at 6:00 PM yesterday, a rural woman, Gu Lin (63 years old), who lived in Dongting Village, was walking back to her village from the city. When she was about four miles from the city, behind Youduli, two bandits suddenly jumped out of the fields and pushed Gu Lin into the field, robbing her of two gold rings she was wearing. The old woman shouted for help, and nearby farmers heard the cries and gave chase. One bandit was captured on the spot, and the stolen gold rings were found on his person. He was immediately handed over to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau. According to the preliminary interrogation by Director Yu, the bandit confessed to the name Tang Hua, from Guangxi, and that he was twenty-nine years old. He admitted to the roadside robbery.

<h3>Lawyers Appeal on Behalf of the People:</h3>
<p>Lawyers Li Zongtang, Jiang Zengyao, Yang Shi, and others of this county have noted that the County Government has been delaying the public posting of approvals for civil and criminal cases. Despite repeated requests from the parties involved, the situation remains unchanged. Furthermore, the execution of cases has been delayed for as long as two or three months, and officials are not dispatched to carry out the executions. As a result, the parties involved suffer not only the burden of litigation but also unexpected losses. Yesterday, they jointly sent a letter to County Magistrate Pan, requesting that he promptly correct the situation to appease the public.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>

<h3>Patrol Leader Commits Suicide by Poisoning:</h3>
<p>The Dafang Hotel, across from the Xinqin Newspaper Office in the northern market of this county, had a guest named Wu Baoming from Dongyang, Zhejiang, who checked into room 28 on the previous day. He went to Huwei with a friend to listen to storytelling that night before returning to the hotel to sleep. However, at around 11:00 AM the next day, he had not yet gotten up. The tea attendant, sensing something was amiss, opened the door with a key to check on him. He found Wu lying horizontally on the bed, unresponsive to calls or pushes. He discovered a glass bottle of Ateling tranquilizer pills and some paper on the table. The tea attendant realized that he had undoubtedly taken poison and reported it to the accounting office. He also urgently invited Dr. Shao Yufan to diagnose the situation and notified his friend Ji Dansheng and others. It was then learned that Wu Baoming was originally a patrol leader in the 13th Branch of the Public Security Bureau of this county. He was later transferred to the 3rd Branch of the Public Security Bureau in Dongtang City by Wang Yunlong, the director of the bureau, and continued to serve in his original position. Wu was known for his diligence in handling matters and was highly regarded by officials. However, last month, for unknown reasons, he had a dispute with a fellow patrol officer and submitted a letter of leave to the director, planning to go to Kunshan County to find other work. He returned unsuccessfully and was planning to resume his duties when the Public Security Bureau was reorganized (originally, there were fifteen branches in this county, but the province ordered them to be merged into six branches), which resulted in the abolition of Wu's position as patrol leader. Baoming was increasingly anxious and came to the city to find a position but was unsuccessful, leading to his suicide. After Dr. Shao gave him an injection, he began to regain consciousness, but was still unable to speak. Later, Qin Yunsheng and Wang Zhenshan, two patrol leaders from the General Bureau, took him to the Jishan Hospital in Hanbeimen for treatment. As of 10:00 PM, he had not yet regained full consciousness, and his life was in great danger.</p>

<h3>Clear Demarcation of Silk and Cloth Tax Boundaries:</h3>
<p>Since the tax on cloth in Zhejiang Province was taken over by the government, the Cloth Tax General Bureau has been scraping the bottom of the barrel due to quota issues, often leading to indiscriminate collection that extends to the silk tax. The Hangzhou Guancheng Hall, which donates public funds, believes that the staff of the Cloth Tax Bureau often have far-fetched misunderstandings, which actually hinder the collection of silk tax. Therefore, it has taken the initiative to draw up silk and cloth boundaries to avoid further disputes.</p>

<h3>Expanded Student Unrest at Central University</h3>
<h3>Students Expel Chief of General Affairs Huang</h3>
<h3>Colleges Telegraph Chairman Chiang Requesting</h3>
<h3>President Zhang to Return to School Immediately</h3>
<h3>Zhang Naiyan Issues Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th - During the Central University's 27th-noon commemoration week, Chief of General Affairs Huang Pu-Huan's chair reported the restructuring process, and it was heard that President Zhang had resigned and gone to Shanghai, and that school affairs would be maintained by him. Many students strongly questioned him and then escorted Mr. Huang to the Office of General Affairs, where they broke the plaque and then escorted Huang out of the school. It is heard that Central University will not establish an Office of General Affairs to comply with the University Organization Law. Now, the eight colleges of Central University have jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang in Fenghua, saying that President Zhang suddenly submitted his resignation, but the reason is not known in detail, rumors are rife, and the public is confused. They request that he be ordered to return to school immediately to facilitate school affairs. Huang Pu-Huan, the Director of the Office of General Affairs of Central University, has temporarily left the school because he felt that it was difficult to handle this morning's commemoration week order, and has telegraphed Zhang Naiyan to return to Beijing to preside over the situation.</p>
<h3>Zhang Naiyan Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>Explaining the Reasons for Resignation and Various Misunderstandings in School Affairs</p>
<p>Central University President Zhang Naiyan gave an interview with a reporter yesterday and expressed his views as follows: President Zhang said that the reason why he proposed his resignation was that he heard that there were many people who wanted to be the president of Central University. He only wants to study recently and does not want fame or profit, and does not want to compete with others for position, so he intends to take this opportunity to get rid of it for recuperation. As for the recent rumors about the school's affairs, there are many misunderstandings in the newspapers, which can be summarized as the following points: (1) The capture of many people in the dormitory during the summer vacation: During the summer vacation, the Garrison Command captured seventy-two people in the student dormitory of the school. They were new students who had come to take the entrance examination and were temporarily lodging in the school because they knew the old students. At that time, due to military relations, traffic in Jiangbei was blocked, and they could not return to their hometowns for a while, which caused suspicion due to the large number of people, and they were arrested. After the department found no evidence of reactionary suspicion, they were all released. (2) Changing the administrative organization: The school's administrative organization was formerly divided into three departments: teaching, administration, and secretary. This time, it was merged into the Office of General Affairs because the two heads of the administrative and secretarial departments resigned at the same time, and the state and provincial governments owed the school fees to the tune of tens of thousands of yuan, so it was necessary to strive for retrenchment. Recalling the era of the former university district system, the director of the higher education office took care of the administration of the university headquarters. This reorganization intends to return a part of the teaching affairs to the colleges, and the chief of general affairs will specialize in administrative affairs. His responsibilities are lighter than those of the director of higher education. (3) The number of administrative expenses: It is rumored that the school's administrative expenses account for more than 300,000 yuan, which is all a misunderstanding. The school's administrative expenses are only more than 150,000 yuan. The amount rumored outside includes the public expenses of the colleges (such as military education courses, general sports fees, library equipment, and other public facilities), so there is this misunderstanding. (4) The deans of the colleges: Each college of the school has a dean. Liu Shuqi is the dean of the College of Science, Cheng Zhenji is the dean of the College of Commerce, Yan Fuqing is the dean of the College of Medicine, and Xie Shoukang is the dean of the College of Liberal Arts. Because he took up the post of chargé d'affaires in Belgium, he asked for leave and was replaced by Wang Dong. Dai Xiujun, the dean of the College of Law, asked for leave due to illness and was replaced by Xie Guansheng. Wei _ resigned temporarily after the opening of school at the College of Education and is currently looking for a suitable candidate to take over the duties. The deans of the Colleges of Agriculture and Engineering, although they are also concurrently appointed, come to school every day to inspect the situation. (5) Reorganizing the school affairs meeting: This matter has long been drafted with a method to increase the representatives of professors and submitted to the school affairs meeting for approval and will be implemented soon. (6) The problem of the College of Science's work stoppage: The faculty and staff of the College of Science previously had difficulty in life due to several months of salary arrears, which led to a request for salary. Later, because the funds were gradually released, there was no intention to stop work. In short, this time, the students started the movement to improve school affairs out of love for the school. Although the method is not in line with the heart, the traces are not unreasonable. The president believes that education should be based on the principle of influence, so the school and the students should sincerely ask for instructions on matters, and groups and individuals should earnestly instruct them to understand and incorporate them into the right track. This is the president's guiding principle for running the school that can be told to the society.</p>

<h3>Record of the Opening Ceremony of Zhejiang Provincial People's Education School</h3>
<p>Hangzhou - Since the Zhejiang Provincial People's Education Experimental School was founded by Chen Bulei, Director of the Department of Education, and Meng Xiancheng, Professor of Zhejiang University, the work of the school headquarters has been gradually completed.

<h3>Establishment of the People's Legal Advisory Office of the Jiangsu Education Institute</h3>
<p>Wuxi - The Jiangsu Provincial Education Institute is the most successful institute in the country in researching and promoting people's education and agricultural education. All new facilities and new news of the institute are published in detail in this newspaper to arouse the attention of readers and work together for people's education.

Therefore, the People's Legal Advisory Office is specially established to protect civil rights, with Professor Chen Zhisani as the advisor. It is heard that Mr. Chen graduated from the Department of Law of Chuo University in Japan and served as a staff member in the Brazilian and Peruvian embassies and judges in various courts.

<h3>Mayor Li's Inauguration Ceremony at Jiaotong University in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at ten o'clock, Li Zhaohuan, the president of National Jiaotong University, held his inauguration ceremony. Attendees included National Government representatives Zhang Qun, Minister of Railways Sun Ke, Vice Minister of Education Zhu Jingnong, Director of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau Liu Weizhi, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Xu Peihuang, President of Datong University Cao Liangxia, Representative of the Xiamen Municipal Finance Bureau Zhang Jie, Japanese Consul Representative Yokotake Heitaro, German Vice Consul Schiebe, Counselor of the Belgian Embassy Colair, and dozens of other Chinese and Western guests, as well as over a thousand faculty, staff, and students. The ceremony was held in the university's Wenzhi Hall, with National Government Representative Mayor Zhang presiding over the oath-taking and various representatives delivering speeches. The speeches are recorded as follows: National Government Representative Zhang Qun's exhortation briefly stated that the current Jiaotong University is the former Nanyang University. Historically speaking, it has been around for thirty-five years. Everyone knows at home and abroad that every year for the entrance examination, young people from all over try various methods, even asking people to intercede, to be admitted to Jiaotong University to study. From this point of view, what is society's impression of Jiaotong University? What is the status of Jiaotong University? I am not very clear about the content of Jiaotong University and have not had the opportunity to visit and study it before, but the status of Jiaotong University in China can be said to be second to none, and it is the only industrial education institution. Outsiders seem to think that Jiaotong University is like Cambridge University in England and MIT in the United States. It is extremely honorable to say this. Secondly, the school has a long history, so talents emerge in large numbers. Graduates with good knowledge are enthusiastic about serving society and the country. Not only does society benefit from this in industry, but the country's construction agencies also receive a lot of contributions. This is also generally recognized. Since the school has been presided over by President Sun and Vice President Li, the school has become even more progressive. Although Minister Sun does not have time to run the school, he has entrusted the vice president and all the faculty and staff. However, President Sun is not only researching the transportation industry, especially the railway, but also managing all the administration. The relationship between the Ministry of Railways and the university is very close. Minister Sun can provide a lot of help to Jiaotong University in administration, so that the school's foundation is consolidated and construction is complete. Then, in transportation administration, it can also increase a lot of convenience. Now, although President Sun does not hold the title, as long as Minister Sun is in office, he will always make them complement each other in both transportation administration and transportation education, so that the school's performance will develop day by day and difficulties will be gradually eliminated. These must have been noticed a long time ago. Speaking of President Li, he is knowledgeable and capable. Now that he has resigned from his position in the Ministry of Railways to focus on running the school, it is even more admirable. In the past, the school added the College of Natural Sciences, the mechanical factory, student dormitories, etc., which proves the efforts of the two presidents, Sun and Li, for the school. Other plans could not be realized for the time being due to funding constraints, but Minister Sun will definitely help President Li to complete them. From these points of view, the development of Jiaotong University is really promising. The military affairs in the front have been completed through the efforts of armed comrades. After the military, construction should be even more vigorously promoted. Speaking of construction, industrial education is even more the mother of construction. If there are no talents, no plans, and no education, even if there is money, it cannot be done. Therefore, in the construction process, industrial talents are more needed than before. Now, students have the opportunity to contribute to the country and society with advanced research. All of President Sun Yat-sen's construction plans can also be completed in a short period of time. I hope that President Li and all the faculty and staff will recognize their responsibilities and do their best, and the country will definitely be built as a whole. This is what I feel today. Vice Minister of Education Zhu Jingnong's exhortation: Today, Minister Jiang could not come due to some matters, so he asked me to represent him to congratulate Jiaotong University. Jiaotong University is the most brilliant university in the country. Now, with a ten-year plan and a capable president, the ten-year plan will definitely succeed. At that time, Jiaotong University will not only be in China but also in the world. This is what everyone hopes for. The current president is exactly the one we hope for. President Li has been studying in the United States for a long time. He is knowledgeable and amiable, and he leads the students with love and sincerity, focusing on running the school and being a pioneer in the education field. People who are running education now often suffer from not being able to concentrate. I hope President Li can take running the school as a lifelong career and do his best to make the ten-year plan succeed as soon as possible and lead the country. Minister of Railways Sun Ke's exhortation: This time, President Li resigned from his position as vice minister and came to specialize in running the school, which has a very important relationship with the future of the school. In the past two or three years, the presidents of the school have all held concurrent positions. Last year, when I took office, I said that I was busy with central affairs and could not spare much time to come here. It was Vice President Li who took over to maintain the school until now. Starting today, President Li will be the full-time president of the school, and in the future, someone will be responsible for the construction of the school. Not only will the status quo be maintained, but also various major plans can be gradually implemented. In recent years, it is true that the situation is difficult and funding is difficult, so the plan cannot be realized. At the same time, the president also holds other positions, so the school cannot progress. Today, President Li is taking office. I hope that all colleagues and students will work together to maintain the school and promote the construction of a new Jiaotong University so that it will not fail the government's appointment of a full-time president. Jiaotong University naturally focuses on transportation, civil engineering, focusing on railway and road engineering, management is also railway management, electrical and mechanical are all the same. However, the disciplines of advanced institutions cannot be limited to one scope. The university organization law requires three colleges, at least one of which must be a science college. Although the school has five colleges, they are all engineering in nature. In law, it cannot be regarded as a complete university. Now, with the addition of the College of Natural Sciences, the original five colleges have been completed in organization. Civil engineering, in addition to road and railway engineering, also has water conservancy and other construction projects. Students do not have the opportunity to study specialized knowledge. The most important mechanical engineering, such as automotive engineering and aviation engineering, is not available in the school. It is not complete for a specialized institution for studying transportation to not have this kind of course. The College of Management mainly teaches specialized knowledge about railways, but management knowledge is very broad and should not be limited to railways. Otherwise, students cannot do anything other than railways. In the future, there will certainly be a need for railway talents, but the talents of all parties must also be developed evenly. China's industry and commerce lack talent, and the college does not have business administration, which is also a shortcoming. Business administration is also related to transportation. Secondly, there is a great lack of financial and administrative personnel. Although the National Government has been established for four or five years, there is no way to handle finance. Financial management still uses the old methods, and everything cannot be on track because the university does not train specialized personnel in financial administration. Therefore, the College of Management should set up financial management. Leaving aside the past, I hope that everyone will work hard from today to create a glorious and brilliant new Jiaotong University. President Li's reply briefly stated that Jiaotong University came from Nanyang College and has a deep meaning in history. Revolutionary talents such as Wu Zhihui and Cai Zimin are all related to the school. The school not only has a history in education but also plays an important role in China's process. The purpose of the school is to build talents for the construction of the Three Principles of the People. After taking office today, I feel that the responsibility is even greater and I will do my best to revitalize it to achieve what everyone has taught.</p>

<h3>25th Anniversary of Qingxin Girls' Middle School</h3>

It is reported that a performance exhibition will be held in the morning and a recreational evening will follow at 2 pm.

<h3>Completion of the New Building of Chenxing Kindergarten</h3>
<p>Chenxing Town in Pudong is the location of the education center. Although the population is small, all the facilities are established in detail, which can be used as a model for other villages. Last year, Qin Huaixin and others, together with the county education bureau, donated funds to establish a kindergarten, which is of an obligatory nature. As a result, the number of younger siblings who are going to school is more than sixty. Because the school building is insufficient, the district office and the National Guard provided several acres of land in the town to build a new building. It has been completed, the air is fresh, and the light is sufficient. The completion ceremony is scheduled to be held on November 1. At that time, Shi Yangyong, director of the county education bureau, and Hu Wenhua, director of the construction bureau, are also expected to go to the village to participate in the grand ceremony.</p>

The 100-meter and shot put records were new provincial records, and the high jump record was almost the same as the national record. The school has such achievements due to the patient teaching of the sports instructor.</p>
<h3>Chinese Women's Sports, Hosted by the Sports Department of Jinan University (4) Chen Zhang'e</h3>
<p>(4) Cooperative Spirit: Our people have been subjected to thousands of years of old education, and their hearts are selfish and self-interested. They do not know or hear about the spirit of cooperation. Therefore, there is a lack of cooperative spirit in both society and the country. When the European War broke out, the United States, through Congress, joined the Allied Powers and sent a million elite soldiers to Germany to help France. General Davis (the current Governor of the Philippines, who also presented the Davis Cup, the world table tennis trophy) fought a great battle for three days and nights on the German border. The poor General Davis was really fighting one against five, with no ability to attack and no ability to defend an area, resulting in the complete annihilation of the army. Later, he returned to the camp to gather the remnants and all the cooks, servants, and female youths (who joined the Female Youth Association at the time) to fight a desperate battle. In less than half a day, they defeated the German army. This spirit of cooperation and common struggle is the result of everyone deeply understanding the great righteousness and fighting regardless of personal safety. Listen to what people say. General Davis is a great athlete and the initiator of the Davis Cup table tennis competition. His subordinates all play American-style football (the most intense game in sports, which is no different from fighting). His soldiers fight everywhere and block the road to fight desperately. We should understand that General Davis's victory is not from practicing sports. At that time, the achievements of the Women's Youth Association were really admirable. (5) Self-Determination and Self-Confidence: American-style football is very popular in the United States, especially in universities. In 1926, the US Naval Academy and the Military Academy held a formal competition in the stadium of Chicago, the second largest city in the United States. The most expensive seat was bought by the US President, and the ticket was worth 3,000 US dollars. The lowest ticket was also worth 3 US dollars. The total number of people attending the conference was 155,000, and the income from the tickets was more than 1 million US dollars. Since the final of the two universities was broadcast, people from all over the country ran to Chicago to participate in the sightseeing. Think about it, this kind of football match is unprecedented in our country. The author happened to be studying in Chicago, so he went to become one of the 100,000 people, so he knew the situation of the football game that day. The first time, the Naval Academy team won. Later, the members of the Naval Academy team were injured, and the battle situation temporarily failed. At the end of the five minutes, the Military Academy team scored 21 points. The Navy and Army teams waited for 15 points. After some time, the Naval Academy team tried their best to fight and must take a TouchDown (a total of six points) to win or lose evenly. The Military Academy team also used all their energy to resist. Most of the people participating at that time had already expected the Naval Academy team to fail. At this time, the captain of the Naval Academy team had to announce to the referees a time-out and gather all the players in one corner to encourage them. Today's victory or defeat depends entirely on our self-determination. If we fail today, how can we face the elders of Jiangdong? So the team members all shouted to fight and were willing to risk their lives to determine the outcome. It was no longer good to have energy. In the last two minutes, when the referees pressed their hands and fired their guns to announce the ending, suddenly the audience applauded like thunder. At the same time, the referees announced that the ending was that the Naval Academy team got the final TouchDown. The whole game was a 21-21 tie. When I saw this situation, my hair stood on end and my face changed color, so I deeply felt that the United States' training in sports was really a bit successful. Comrades, their self-determination and self-confidence are all encouraged by sports, so using this spirit to do social things will definitely be successful. (6) Brave Sacrifice: In 1927, a matter published in a certain newspaper in Chicago is most informative for us. In the state of Indiana, a church was holding a women's conference. The auditorium was located on a building of more than 20 floors. After the meeting had been going on for a while, a fire suddenly broke out on all sides, and the elevators and stairs were all broken. There were about a thousand women attending the meeting. The only place in the auditorium where they could escape for their lives was the safe door. At that time, all the thousand people tried desperately to escape through the door. At one time, too many people wanted to escape, and the safe door had not been opened for many years. If they delayed for another 15 minutes, I am afraid that all the thousand people would die together. Suddenly, a young woman stood up and shouted loudly, "All female compatriots, pay attention! If we wait another five minutes, we will all die. It is best to ask everyone to take three steps back and let me open the door." At that time, the people were at a moment of danger for their lives and there was no other way to escape, so they reluctantly took three steps back. The young woman ran madly towards the safe door and hit the door with her body. The door panel suffered a major blow and opened in response. Everyone escaped safely from here. Later, the women wanted to see the brave young woman, but the woman rolled down the stairs when she opened the door because she used too much force, and her whole body was crushed. How pitiful! How brave this young woman is! She sacrificed herself to save the thousands of female peers. Later, I heard his parents and classmates talk about how he often won various women's sports events at school and was extremely brave. Today, he sacrificed his life because of the effect of his sports studies. He can sacrifice. Dear readers, this person is truly a follower of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. We should learn from his example. What we advocate for sports is to create a complete personality that we should have. To put it simply, it is to train our 200 million female compatriots in China to have sports training and to obtain agile posture, health, and to cultivate habits, cooperative spirit, self-determination, self-confidence, and brave sacrifice. In the future, they will serve the country and seek happiness for the people in society. This is the author's view on Chinese women's sports. I always ask all sports comrades to promote and work hard in the future.</p>

<h3>The China General Federation of Industry and Commerce Convened an Election Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<h3>Seventeen Committee Members Elected, Kong Xiangxi Attended and Delivered a Speech</h3>
<p>The China General Federation of Industry and Commerce convened an election meeting ahead of schedule at the Bank Association on Hong Kong Road yesterday, as the National Industrial and Commercial Conference is about to open. The purpose was to elect the second term of officers. Regarding the group members, the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Association, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Mechanized Flour Mill Association, the National Match Factory Association, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Silk Factory Association, the National Private Electrical Enterprise Association, the North China Industrial Association, the Wuxi Silk Factory Association, the Wuxi Textile Factory Association, the Shanghai Silk Factory Association, the Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Association, the Oil Press Factory Association, and the Shanghai Mechanized Flour Mill Association, among others, sent representatives such as Nie Lusheng, Zhang Zemin, Li Beitao, Liu Hongsheng, Zhu Jing'an, Li Yanshi, Cai Jiansan, Qian Chuangao, Qian Chengxu, Shen Huachen, Wang Xiaolai, Shen Tianxin, Qian Xuanqing, Zhu Jing'an, and Wang Yaochen, totaling more than 20 people. Regarding the factory members, Huacheng Tobacco Company, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Company, Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Meiyi Refining Factory, Taishan Brick and Tile Company, Tun Chu Flavor Essence Factory, and Guangyu Cotton and Iron Business Company, among others, sent representatives such as Dai Gengxin, Lao Jingxiu, Wang Yunwu, Lu Feibo, Shi Liangcai, Wang Boqi, Cai Shengbai, Huang Shoumin, Wu Yunxu, and Yan Yutang, totaling more than 10 people. As a result of the election, Liu Hongsheng, Nie Lusheng, Wang Yunwu, Wang Yaochen, Zhu Jing'an, Li Yanshi, Fan Xudong, Cai Jiansan, Qian Chengxu, Shen Huachen, and Wu Yunxu, among others, 17 people with the most votes were elected as members of the association. After the election concluded, the representatives of the members held a dinner. Qian Chengxu was publicly elected as the temporary chairman to report on the situation over the past two years and the future development plan of the association. On this day, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce was invited to attend the meeting and deliver a speech, thoroughly elaborating on the four characters of "Knowing is Difficult, Doing is Easy," which moved the audience. Wang Yunwu then gave a speech on scientific management, which also contained many incisive words. Minister Kong's speech is as follows: (Ladies and gentlemen, today is the election and dinner of the China General Federation of Industry and Commerce. I am very happy to be here. I have a few words to sincerely say to you. First, we must know ourselves and know our enemies in order to establish ourselves and act. Only in this way can we understand the weaknesses of others and determine the strategy of attack. Premier Sun said that "Knowing is Difficult, Doing is Easy," which shows that the universe is vast and all-encompassing. The invention of things and the evolution of nature were difficult at the beginning. The mystery of the invention is revealed, and the principles of science are determined. Then the latter only needs to follow the law and does not need to spend any more brainpower or thought. Therefore, I deeply feel that the word "knowing" is extremely difficult, whether its position is for oneself or for a third party. It is difficult to achieve the goal without putting in hard work at the root. Second, the industrial world should have a solid unity. There is strength only after everything is united. This is an ancient saying. Because today, the industrial organizations of various countries are connected to each other like a string of pearls. For example, if we start a factory, we may need to buy coal from Mr. Liu Hongsheng, consult with Mr. Li Yanshi about electricity, and choose bricks and tiles from Mr. Huang Shoumin. The relationship between them is very close. In short, under today's trend, it is impossible for one person to do one business without considering the interests of the general public and groups and without dedicating oneself to studying the situation of other industries. Third, the industrial world should have self-reflection. We are busy all day long, and there is still social life after rest. No matter how strong the physique is, there is no time to work hard on self-reflection. Let me give an example. In ancient times, we used water to look at our faces, but now we use mirrors. Our original appearance, whether beautiful or ugly, clean or dirty, is not known to ourselves. We must rely on material tools to leave a shadow. Therefore, everything in the world, its own weaknesses cannot be seen by itself. Is it not the same in industry? Western industrialists, in view of the lack of self-reflection time and the difficulty in discovering their own shortcomings, borrowed from others and asked third parties to study on their behalf. Factory operators may not necessarily be experts in industry, and industrial experts may not necessarily operate factories. Western industry has benefited greatly from its ability to use this method of division of labor and cooperation. The organization of the China Industrial and Commercial Management Association is to promote this division of labor and cooperation and to promote the improvement of various factories with scientific management methods. Ladies and gentlemen, you should pay attention to this. Fourth, colleagues in the industrial world should have a world vision and pay special attention to raw materials. Our country's foreign trade only includes items such as silk, tea, tung oil, and soybeans, which are not industrial products but raw materials. In the past, the export of tung oil and soybeans was very high. Today, the United States has widely planted tung trees and soybeans and used chemical refining methods to match other materials to form ingredients. The color of its oil is better than that of our country. According to an American friend, the United States will no longer need to import Chinese beans and Chinese oil in a few years. Another example is white silk, which has always been a major export of our country. Since the import of rayon, its impact has not only been unable to manufacture it ourselves to compete with it, but instead uses foreign raw materials to absorb our money. All of these are because we have not meticulously studied the methods of cultivating and producing raw materials and have not worked hard on science. International trade and overseas markets are both specialized fields. It is impossible to gain considerable experience and knowledge by just reading newspapers in the country. We must also humbly adopt and delegate the research work to experts to conduct investigations and plans on our behalf, so that the results can be more macro-like divination. In short, I don’t need to list too many past events. What I hope for in the future and what I expect from you are: (1) Industry can effectively reorganize itself and increase production; (2) Use its own raw materials to manufacture various items; (3) Industry and commerce are the vitality of the country. The government's protection is certainly a responsibility, but at the same time, we must also work hard to make progress. This autumn of expensive gold and cheap silver is a great opportunity to seek the development of the domestic industry, etc.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Fourth Council Meeting of the Industrial and Commercial Management Association</h3>
<p>The China Industrial and Commercial Management Association had to convene the fourth council meeting ahead of schedule to solve important matters because the Central Industrial and Commercial Department's Industrial and Commercial Conference was about to open and most of the directors had to go to Beijing to attend. The meeting was held at the United Association a few days ago. Directors Liu Hongsheng, Xu Jilou, Pan Xulun, Shou Yicheng, and Li Quanshi, among others, attended. A total of two important proposals were discussed. Chairman Liu Hongsheng first reported on the association's work and income and expenditure. Then, the proposal of Director Tao Leqin (the Industrial and Commercial Management Association's work plan) was discussed, totaling five articles. The first said that the funding must be determined. It was resolved that the council would be responsible for raising several thousand yuan. There were also those who denied the remaining four articles, and there were also those who passed them. Then, the proposal of the Financial Group to promote the acceptance bill was discussed. It was resolved that the two directors, Jin Guobao and Cai Chengxin, who made the original proposal, would still be responsible for handling it.</p>
<h3>The National Tax Commission Releases the Shanghai Cost of Living Index</h3>
<h3>The Cost of Living in the City in the First Half of This Year</h3>
<h3>Is 20% Higher Than in 1926</h3>
<p>The former Shanghai Price Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance tried to compile the Shanghai Cost of Living Index in 1926 and 1927 as a standard for measuring the cost of living. Later, it stopped continuing to compile it because the assumed weights were not very accurate. Then, it cooperated with the Peking Social Survey Institute (formerly the Social Survey Department of the China Education and Culture Foundation Board) to conduct a family survey of Shanghai workers in order to compile a more credible cost of living index based on actual survey data for reference by all sectors. The survey work began in November 1927 and lasted for 12 months until October 1928. After the Price Investigation Bureau reviewed the materials, it successively sent them to the Social Survey Institute for collation and analysis. In May 1929, the Price Investigation Bureau was ordered to abolish all its functions and merge them into the National Tax Commission. Now, the commission is compiling the index based on the results of this family survey. Since the family survey began, it has lasted for three years and has exhausted the efforts of dozens of people. This cost of living index has finally been completed. From now on, the cost of living in the city will have a numerical series to rely on, and labor-capital disputes can also refer to this index as a basis for mediation. It cannot be said that it is not a contribution to our country's statistical science. The association's index performance has been released, and its explanatory note has a separate book sold by the Commercial Press.</p>
<h3>The Deadline for the Exchange of Sandfield Official Property Licenses for Land Certificates Is Approaching</h3>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau issued a notice on May 9 of this year, ordering Sandfield official property owners to exchange their licenses for land certificates within six months, in order to be responsible for the fact that the Sandfield official property owners had exchanged their licenses for land certificates and asked them to increase their food into the book. Now that the deadline is approaching, it is heard that the Land Bureau will implement the purchase of the part of the property that has not been exchanged for land certificates by giving a price. It is hoped that those who hold this license will go to request the increase of food and exchange the certificate as soon as possible. After that, the ledgers should be sent to the bureau at any time to exchange the certificates into the book to bear the grain in order to be protected according to law and avoid losses. A copy of the above notice is attached as follows for the purpose of the notice. The handling of Sandfield official property is related to the municipal land administration, and the events involving Sandfield official property in the municipal land administration were previously ordered by the municipal government (Ministry of Finance) to promulgate five measures to comply with. Article 4 of the measures stipulates that (the Sandfield official property released for sale should be issued by the branch bureau on a monthly basis to make a book and draw a picture to be sent to the Land Bureau for inclusion in the book and increase in grain at any time). Since then, for the newly issued part of the property, the Shanghai Bao Sandfield Official Property Affairs Branch Bureau will comply with the cleaning up. However, there are many financial department licenses issued in the past that have not been included in the book and increased in grain. In order to sort out the land and protect the property rights, the bureau has submitted the No. 5313 instruction to the municipal government, stating that it is intended to limit the period of six months to order the Sandfield official property owners to increase the grain into the book and exchange the land business certificate. After the expiration date, the original price of the land recorded in the license shall be added with an annual interest of six percent, and the land price shall be returned after deducting the grain tax completed in previous years, and the land shall be taken back by the city for further recruitment. It is also in order to sort out the land. It should be approved to follow the instructions of this order. All business owners who hold the financial department licenses issued in the past and have not increased their food into the book should request to increase their food into the book, pay the fee for increasing the subject, and exchange the land business certificate within six months from the date of the notice to engage in business. After the expiration date, the bureau will immediately add an annual interest of six percent to the original land price recorded in the license, deduct the grain tax completed in previous years, and return the land price to take the land back by the city for another recruitment. The newly issued part of the property should also be limited to six months from the date of the issuance of the license to increase the grain into the book in order to sort out. All business owners should comply with this and do not violate this notice.</p>
<h3>The Population Survey Forms in the Public Concession Begin to Be Checked</h3>
<h3>It Will Take Three or Four Weeks to Complete</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that most of the population survey forms in the Public Concession were completed last week, with only a few remaining. It is expected that the police will collect them all by Monday morning. The staff of the donation office started checking them on Monday morning, but because there are too many households, the survey forms that have been collected are nearly 100,000, and many people are listed on each form, so it is expected that it will take three or four weeks to complete the calculation. The population survey went smoothly this time, which was due to the efforts of the staff, and the assistance of the police and health department personnel was also helpful.</p>
<h3>Various Trade Associations Gathered Yesterday to Discuss Trade Rules</h3>
<p>One hundred and fourteen trade associations attended to organize the Trade Rules Protection Committee. The trade associations in the city invited the South Goods Trade Association and other groups to hold a joint meeting of representatives of various industries in the assembly hall of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce because of the importance of trade rules.

<h3>Two Foreign Affairs Agencies Moved to New Locations Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Diplomatic Discussion Committee and the Intelligence Department moved to Fenglin Bridge due to the expiration of the lease contract for the building on Avenue Joffre. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, formerly the Jiangsu Negotiation Office, officially began operations there yesterday. In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' radio station, originally located on the third floor of 1066 Avenue Joffre, also needs to be moved due to the expiration of the lease. Although the Foreign Affairs Office in Fenglin Bridge has suitable buildings that can be used for the radio station, the reception and transmission of radio waves is difficult due to the proximity of the Municipal Government and the two radio stations on Route Frelupt of the French Concession. Therefore, a new site has been leased at Yuanchang Lane on Hualong Road, and the station will move in for operation within a few days.</p>

<p>Many Important Matters Resolved 　　Representatives Designated for Negotiations 　　Support Declaration Published. Various groups in Shanghai, in response to the case of French sailors relying on their power to drown boatman Xin Dingkang, established the Xin Case Support Association at the Shanghai Commercial Press Union on Ning Mountain Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. The groups present included representatives from the Sixth District Party Branch, Wang Changyuan; the Ningbo Association, Wu Ya; the Shanghai Commercial Press Union, Qian Hongcai and Ni Yaoxian; the China General Edison Union, Tang Junsheng; the British American Tobacco Union, Li Guangxian; the Commercial Press Distribution Union, Wang Yongliang; the Steamship Wood Industry Union, Ye Xianggao; the British Shanghai Gas Company Union, Zhang Yaolin; and the Zhabei District Union of the Chinese Bookbinding Industry, Qian Youxiang, totaling over ninety people. The deceased's family, including his father, wife, and relatives, were also present. Wang Changyuan was elected chairman and Cheng Zhiliang was elected secretary. After the opening ceremony, the chairman reported on the significance and mission of organizing the support association. Then, Wu Yaqin, a representative from the Ningbo Association, reported on the Ningbo Association's plenary executive and committee joint meeting yesterday.</p>
<p>The meeting focused on the importance of the Xin case, changed the agenda, and prioritized the discussion of the Xin case and the countermeasures. The results of the discussion were seven items, which will not be announced temporarily. Next, various resolutions were discussed: (1) Designating the Sixth District Party Branch, Ningbo Association, British American Tobacco Union, Commercial Press Union, Commercial Press Distribution Union, Press Union, Postal Workers Union, China General Edison Union, and British Shanghai Gas Company Union as members of the support association (based on group representation). (2) The first committee meeting is scheduled for 2:00 PM on November 3rd at the same location. (3) Submitting a report to the Municipal Party Branch for record, drafted by the Commercial Press Union. (4) All municipal unions jointly issue a declaration of support, drafted by the Postal Workers Union. The declaration is copied as follows (titles omitted): "Imperialists have long used unequal treaties as a talisman, disregarding the lives of our Chinese people. We do not know the countless number of our compatriots who have been sacrificed under their iron heels. Under the banner of the blue sky and white sun, in this time of promoting humanitarianism, we hoped that they would become aware and restrain their ferocity. However, their bestial nature is difficult to tame, and they constantly reveal their hideous faces, and the abuse of our compatriots is still too numerous to record. This time, boatman Xin Dingxiang was beaten by French sailors for demanding fare for crossing the Huangpu River and pushed into the river, resulting in drowning. Alas, the lives of our compatriots in the eyes of those imperialists are less than those of ants. Their disregard for justice and humanity has reached this extreme. Who among those with blood and qi cannot be filled with righteous indignation? If we do not negotiate seriously, how can we protect the national dignity and comfort the wronged souls? Therefore, our associations believe that this matter is not only a personal tragedy for Xin Dingxiang, but also a matter of life and death for our entire nation. We have organized the Xin Case Support Association to resist unanimously and serve as the government's diplomatic support. We will also severely monitor the running dogs of the imperialists. Our minimum demands are: (1) They must formally apologize to our government and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. (2) Urge severe punishment of the murderers and the police officers who privately released the murderers. (3) In addition to providing funeral expenses for the deceased, they should also provide alimony to the deceased's family in accordance with our country's precedent for compensating foreigners. Our associations will go all out to achieve the above three points and will fight to the death until our goals are achieved. We also urge our government to follow the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's instructions to promptly recover the concessions, withdraw foreign troops stationed in China, and abolish all unequal treaties as a fundamental remedy. We hope that our revolutionary masses will work together to avenge national humiliation. Our associations are willing to be at the forefront and will never hesitate. This is our declaration."</p>
<h3>Labor-Capital Dispute in the Pawn Industry: Six Employees Released After Yesterday's Interrogation</h3>

After the police station explained the details of the closure, the general police station determined that the six employees had not acted improperly and that the declaration they issued was very peaceful, so they released the six employees without bail. At 2:00 PM yesterday, the union convened an emergency meeting of all executive committee members to detail the report of the Yongqing Pawnshop to the police station and the arrest of union members. The following resolutions were made: (1) The executive committee will send representatives to negotiate with the capital association to modify the terms of the case. It was resolved that Jin Futian, Wang Ganxin, Li Fulin, Qiu Bonian, and Cheng Hongchun would depart together at 9:00 AM on the 28th. (2) Yongqing Pawnshop reported to the police station to suppress members from attending the conference and arrested union members without cause, which is obviously to undermine the labor movement and infringe on human rights. It was resolved to negotiate severely and send a letter of negotiation to the manager of Yongqing Pawnshop: (A) The manager of the pawnshop should apologize to the union and the six arrested comrades; (B) Report the Yongqing perpetrator to the Municipal Party Branch for investigation and reprimand the pawn industry association.

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Refuses to Pay Increased Water Prices Again</h3>
<p>Cannot Pay the Bill in Full Before the Account Audit is Resolved. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously refused to pay the increased water prices by the Shanghai Waterworks Company before the account audit was completed and returned the original bills. It has been reported in various newspapers that the company, citing approval from the Public Works Department, still requested payment. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that this matter concerns the interests of all citizens and has returned the billing again. The letter to the Waterworks Company is recorded as follows: "In response to your letter of the 20th of this month, stating that the increase in water prices has been formally approved and that all accounts from September onwards should be charged at the increased rate before any changes are notified, and returning the billing that was returned, etc., we have investigated that your company has requested the Taxpaying Chinese Association to elect representatives to jointly audit the operating revenue and expenditure of previous years for the purpose of increasing water prices, and your company also acknowledges that this move concerns the interests of all citizens and that, in addition to approval procedures, the public opinion of all citizens must be considered in order to gain the understanding of all citizens. It has been approved by the 17th regular meeting of the Chamber of Commerce that payment at the increased rate cannot be paid before the account audit is resolved. Accordingly, we hereby return the original bill and request your verification. ("Xin Sheng She")</p>
<h3>Recent News on the徵借华界房租</h3>
<p>An電 message from this city stated that it was ordered to raise 1 million yuan in short-term customs treasury bills for the 19th year. The Municipal Government has issued a notice to collect two months' rent from the city's Hua Jie (Chinese-administered area). Nanshi and Zhabei landlords such as Pan Peide and 77 others reported that the total amount of rent in the Hua Jie for two months is indeed over 2 million yuan, which is more than double the amount of funds allocated by the central government. At a time when the Hua Jie industry is declining and financial turnover is not clear, it is impossible to bear this burden. On the 8th of this month, they jointly submitted a petition to the central government and the municipal government requesting a flexible solution to collect up to 1 million yuan and requesting the municipal government to publish the amount collected at any time to demonstrate its integrity. The Qiu Minjian and others' situation has been previously reported. It is now learned that the landlords have received an order from the Ministry of Finance stating that it has been learned that the rent in the Hua Jie of Shanghai City is no less than 2 million yuan. In addition to requesting the Shanghai Municipal Government to verify and handle this matter, this order is for notification. After receiving the order, the landlords also sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance listing six facts proving that the rent in the Hua Jie did indeed exceed 1 million yuan, requesting the government to limit the requisition of rent to one month. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Finance Discussion Committee sent a letter to the Shanghai South Zhabei Landlords' Representative Pan Peide and others stating that the 市商會昨函市財政局云 (Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Municipal Finance Bureau yesterday saying): "Respectfully informing that we received a letter from the Paint Industry Association on the 25th of this month stating that the Association's previous漆業總公所 board system had the same status as various industry groups and charitable organizations and that there were no expenses for various housing donations. Since the official collection of quarterly donations began two years ago, the Association's monthly fees collected from only 20 to 30 households were barely enough to cover the cost of the office's manual labor and meals. Therefore, the quarterly donation of 11 yuan, 2 jiao, and 6 fen was collected and paid by various help Si Dong. This time, the financial authorities collected rent without prior notice, and the collection staff and patrolmen came to the Association yesterday noon to collect one month's rent at a set price of 50 yuan (the quarterly donation of 11 yuan, 2 jiao, and 6 fen is marked on the donation ticket with a monthly rent estimate of 35 yuan and several jiao). However, the staff in charge of the association reported that the address here is historically 薛衖庫街 (Xue Xiang Ku Street), but the front door number is 5 Guoyu Tang Street. Since the establishment of the Association more than 70 years ago, the house has been built with funds from the industry. There is no landlord and no tenant. Every special request must be raised temporarily from various help leaders (this time, the establishment of a formal association to collect membership fees should improve everything). However, the financial bureau collection staff completely ignored it. Before leaving, they said that they would come to collect 50 yuan between 1:00 PM and 2:00 PM tomorrow, requesting your Association to quickly submit a letter to the Finance Bureau's Rent Collection Director on the situation and request an exemption. The Association has investigated that according to Article 3 of the Regulations on Borrowing Rent, although the Association is a legal organization, there is no exemption from housing donations on file. Therefore, this borrowing of rent does not seem to be eligible for exemption. However, Article 7 of the same regulations states (the rent to be borrowed by each household should be based on the rent amount listed on the most recent housing donation ticket). That is, the Association should only pay the amount estimated on the donation ticket. The collector arbitrarily set the price at 50 yuan, which is inconsistent with the promulgated regulations. It is appropriate to report the situation to you and request your Bureau to instruct the collection office in the district to handle the matter in accordance with the regulations and not to arbitrarily increase the estimated price, which would involve excessive collection. It is a great honor."</p>
<h3>Ma Yuren Flees Back to Lüsi</h3>

<h3>News from Various Fellow Associations</h3>

I and the people will encourage each other. Then, Fellow Wang Xianmo delivered a speech on behalf of the association, briefly stating that today's welcome has two points. On the one hand, Special Envoy Du's ability to gain the national government's attention and dispatch him to inspect the state of the navy is the glory of the fellow association. On the other hand, it is hoped that Special Envoy Du will contribute his insights from the inspection to the national government so that our country's navy can compete with various countries in the future. The fellow association is very happy. My country is fortunate. Shaoxing Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Shaoxing Seven Counties Fellow Association held its annual general meeting.

However, some residents raise chickens, ducks, and livestock, allowing them to roam freely in the streets all day, leaving droppings everywhere. This has a great impact on the overall appearance and sanitation. The situation is especially bad in southern Shanghai, where it is a common sight. Therefore, we respectfully request that the Municipal Police Bureau issue a general order to all districts and stations to carry out crackdowns at any time, etc." The meeting agreed that the aforementioned is not without merit, and that municipal facilities should be rectified at any time, without neglecting even the smallest details. Residents lack common sense and arbitrarily raise chickens, ducks, and livestock, which is a common problem among citizens. Southern Shanghai is of particular concern to both Chinese and foreigners, and special attention should be paid to it. Therefore, we are forwarding the situation and respectfully request that your bureau forward it to all district and station chiefs, urging them to pay attention to guidance at all times in order to emphasize sanitation, etc." In accordance with this, in addition to replying and issuing separate orders, this order instructs the district and station chiefs to comply and instruct their subordinates to investigate and prohibit at all times. This order is issued.</p>

He assumed that the customer had carelessly left it behind. The original item was transferred to the accounting department and temporarily stored by Huang Longchu, who posted announcements in Shen Xin and other newspapers to find the owner.</p>

<h3>Two Railway Offices Open More Ticket Windows</h3>
<p>The Traffic Office of the Jinpu, Huning and Hangyong Railway Bureau, in view of the increasing number of passengers, has found that the newly built ticket offices are still insufficient. Therefore, at the beginning of the month, it transferred the order to the Engineering Office to extend the original location and open six more ticket windows. The work has now been completed and will be put into use immediately so that passengers can avoid crowding when buying tickets in the future.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Precious Metal Stamp Tax Bureau Schedules Inspection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Precious Metal Stamp Tax Bureau has scheduled an inspection to begin on November 1st, as the time for the second half of the year has arrived. Guan Jiong, the director of the bureau, convened a meeting of all inspectors yesterday and instructed them that the main purpose of promoting stamp tax is to ensure that the people understand the tax law, universally affix stamps, and develop the national habit of respecting national taxes so that public tax revenue can be gradually expanded and the legal rights of the people can be protected. The inspection method is nothing more than to show punishment to the few who neglect to evade taxes so that they know to be alert. He deeply hoped that the number of cases of punishment would decrease day by day so that stamp tax revenue would naturally increase day by day. It is heard that the bureau is carefully selecting inspection personnel to ensure that all words and actions towards merchants are sincere and peaceful during the implementation of the inspection, and that no harassment is involved. It is heard that several inspection guidelines have been compiled based on this principle and distributed to the inspectors for reading. The printed announcement has been distributed to the bureau's servants to be widely posted in urban and rural areas. The announcement reads: "This is an announcement regarding stamp tax as a good national tax, and all merchants and people should fulfill their obligations to bear it. Now, it is found that most merchants and people in the Shanghai Precious Metal area know that stamp tax has the effect of protecting legal rights and have mostly complied with the regulations and purchased and affixed stamps, which is an improvement compared to before. However, there are still many people with limited knowledge who are indifferent and those who take advantage of loopholes, attempt to evade taxes, and intend to evade them. This bureau is now ordered to conduct stricter audits and comparisons and has to pay attention to rectification. The inspection period for the second half of this year is scheduled to begin on November 1st, and inspection teams will be sent to various districts in the city and countryside in groups to carry out the inspection in order in addition to reporting and sending separate letters. This announcement is hereby issued to inform all merchants and people to be aware that if any understamping or insufficient stamping is found at the time of inspection of books, receipts, and other documents, they will be punished according to the law without any leniency. They must all comply and not violate this order. This is very important."</p>

[P Hu Wenhu Returns to China to Investigate Industries &gt;</p>
<p>Donates a Large Sum to Promote Maternal and Child Health. And will set up branches in Fanyang and Shanghai. Hu Wenhu, General Manager of Singapore Tiger Balm Wing On Tong and Overseas Chinese Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, has traveled to Annam, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Shenyang, Tianjin, Dalian, and other places this time to investigate new drug businesses. He arrived in Shanghai on the 20th of this month. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Lishi Society sent personnel to welcome him. The next day, he was accompanied by Li Shesong Shuyi Cheng, Li Weimin, Deng Shiping, and others to Beijing to pay his respects to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and Minister Liu of the Ministry of Health. With the introduction of Ministers Kong and Liu, he met Chairman Jiang on the 22nd and participated in the triumphal return of Chairman Jiang and the forward commanders in the capital. In the afternoon of the same day, Minister Liu held a meeting at the Ministry of Health to welcome Mr. Hu. In view of the importance of maternal and child health, he donated 350,000 yuan to the national currency as funding for the maternal and child department of the Central Hospital in the capital. The funds were deposited by Mr. Hu in the Shanghai Hefeng Bank the next day for application.

<h3>Japanese Rice Still Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The second batch has been shipped to Tianjin. The third batch will arrive in Shanghai. According to Japanese sources yesterday, although sales of the first batch of 18,300 stones of Japanese rice in Shanghai were not very widespread, there were still orders from various parts of the north. Therefore, Japanese rice merchants believe that the opportunity is excellent and are using the fact that customs has not yet banned it to buy up rice in the Japanese mainland and ship it to Shanghai to make a huge profit. It was learned yesterday that the second batch of 2,500 bags of Japanese rice was loaded on the Changcheng Maru the day before yesterday (25th) to be shipped directly to Tianjin for import, which was transported and sold by Yamada Store in this port. In addition, a third batch of several thousand bags were sold by Kato Store in Nagoya and will be shipped to Shanghai from Japan within days for import in Shanghai and then sold in Shanghai. Although the anti-Japanese atmosphere is high recently, Japanese merchants are still actively pursuing it because of the large profits involved. It will only stop after customs officially issues a ban order.</p>
<h3>New Ming Lun Teahouse Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>After the accident of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's New Kang Lun, the workers of the ship stopped working for a long time, and their lives became more and more difficult. They went to the Seamen's Union to request settlement. The union approved the request and convened a meeting of all committee members to discuss ways to settle the displaced workers. It was decided to use a lottery to settle the workers separately. Lu Rongjin, a teahouse worker, was drawn to work at New Jiangtian. Because New Jiangtian had no position at the time, he changed to work on the Beiyang New Ming Lun. After the ship arrived at the port last time, the teahouse worker was assigned to work on the ship, but he was rejected by some of the teahouse workers on the ship. The two sides had a dispute. Although he was able to go north with the ship, he was not formally employed. Last Saturday, the ship came to Shanghai from Tianjin again. The two sides reported to the Shanghai Seamen's Union. The union sent Mr. Yin to the New Ming Lun to mediate yesterday morning. A meeting of the heads of each group in the middle cabin of the ship was convened on board. It was decided that Lu Rongjin would be assigned to work in the rear cabin. The teahouse worker expressed satisfaction, and the matter was resolved.</p>
<h3>Jishenghui Raises Funds for the Unprecedented Disaster in Henan Province</h3>
<p>The China Jishenghui recently received a telegram from the Henan Province Relief Association stating that Henan Province has suffered disasters over the years, and the association has been able to survive thanks to your association's heavy relief efforts. This time, the military campaign has engulfed the entire war zone in northern and southern Henan. The strong have fled to avoid conscription, and the old and weak have been forced to wander in hunger and cold. Autumn winds are fierce, and winter is approaching. The blood of war has just dried, and the ashes of the disaster have not cooled. How can the dozens of counties of trenches and ruins be restored to farmland? How can the lives of thousands of hungry and lonely people be sustained? The cries shake the earth, and the tragedies are shocking. If assistance is delayed, the bodies will be abandoned and turned to dust. We beg all philanthropists to urgently find ways to provide relief to orphans and to restore humanity, and we await your urgent orders, etc. This association has handled various emergency reliefs in Nanyang, Henan, river works in Lishi River, Henan, civilian life canal works in Qixian County, Heian, Shanxi Province, porridge factories, and relief grain relief aid in Zhenping, Fangcheng, Xiangcheng, Dengxian, Yexian, Tanghe Neixiang, Nanzhao Lushan Yuxian and other counties in the past years. During this unprecedented disaster last month, we first transported specially-made medicinal epidemic relief Jishengtang elixir in 30,000 bottles from Tianjin to the Henan Disaster Relief Committee in Lüping for distribution to the interior of Henan and war zones to save the epidemic. The association is now in the midst of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and other provinces' urgent relief works are unfinished, and the Liaoning flood is also managing two Suizhong porridge factories that needs tens of thousands of dollars in foreign currency for it's operation. The winter relief in Peiping cannot be ignored, with the rescue requests from all provinces coming like snowflakes while the association's relief funds has long been exhausted and unable to cope. We want to save but have no money, and we can't bear not to save. However, the war and natural disasters in Henan are a double whammy, which is extremely tragic. We hope that compatriots and people of goodwill will make vows to promote relief, and that it is easy to lift with everyone's strength. Saving one person's life is better than building a seven-level pagoda. We look forward to the compassionate clouds to give us sweet rain, and we offer incense to the millions of disaster victims in Henan Province and pray.</p>
<h3>Fire at the Chenghuang Temple Injures People</h3>
<p>At 11:30 PM last night, a fire suddenly broke out at Zhou Xuanwen's denture shop in the Chenghuang Temple in South Shanghai. The smoke was thick and filled the air, rising through the roof. Two apprentices were awakened from their dreams. Because they were slow to escape, their feet were severely burned. The fire brigades from each district rushed to the scene to put out the fire and extinguished it after a while. It is estimated that one and a half rooms were destroyed by the fire. The two injured were sent by vehicle to Renji Hospital for treatment. The names of the two people are recorded below: Su Ruigen, 17 years old, from Pudong; Ye Xigen, 16 years old, from Zhejiang.</p>
<h3>Lost Madwoman Awaiting Claim</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday received a lost madwoman surnamed Ding from the First Station of the Sixth District. When asked about her name, address, and family situation, her speech was garbled and she gesticulated and danced. It was not possible to answer anything. It was found that the madwoman was wearing a straight tribute twill coat, white cloth trousers, white foreign socks, and leather shoes. She was sent to Xin Puyu Hall for treatment. An announcement was posted to find the family members, and the Pudong Public Office was asked to investigate the family members.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday said that the weather in the Yangtze River Basin and the coastal areas south of Ma'anshan Island was cloudy with fog or misty rain. The weather on the coast of Shandong was sunny. There was a north wind to east wind in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. Also, the highest temperature in the port in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday was 68.7 and the lowest was 60.8. The highest was 68.9 and the lowest was 46.6 on the same day last year.</p>
<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>I was surprised to read in the Shanghai News on the 24th of this month that Liu Yingzhou is an executive of this store. Because Mr. Liu Yingzhou only works as a partner in this store, and Mr. Liu has taken another job in the last month. I think there are some inaccuracies in the rumors. Please publish this letter in the Letters to the Editor column to correct it. Sincerely, the Meilun Silk Satin Cloth Store, East Gate Road, South City, October 25. Respectfully, Regarding the names of the friends mentioned in my lawsuit case are Cheng Bilan, Zhai Yizhi, and Hu Haishun instead of Chen Bingnan, Zhou Yizhi, and Hu Haishen. Because these two friends are not currently in Shanghai, they may be able to testify in the future. Therefore, their names must be clearly distinguished. Please correct it immediately. With infinite gratitude, Respectfully, Tang Huixuan, October 26.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>A: I hardly recognize your father today. Didn't the old gentleman used to have a thick, dark beard? Where has it gone?</p>
<p>B: It's all been cut off.</p>
<p>A: What a pity, what a pity! How could you lightly sacrifice such a handsome beard?</p>
<p>B: It's just that my mother complained that the pillow was too hard at night, so she had the old gentleman's beard stuffed into the pillow.</p>
<p>Philanthropist (soliciting donations from a wealthy woman): Madam, you must know that the citizens here are very pitiful. Their lives are long in the darkness and they cannot get a ray of light.</p>
<p>Wealthy woman: Then I have matches here. Take them and light a fire for them.</p>
<p>A: How could you be so generous as to give that blind beggar two dimes?</p>
<p>B: He said so many nice things that I was very touched, and he called me a beautiful young lady.</p>
<p>A: That's called a blind man talking nonsense.</p>
<p>Girl: Mother often mentions you.</p>
<p>Boy: That's a great honor. Does she say anything good?</p>
<p>Girl: She says you're a born politician.</p>
<p>Boy: That's right, that's right. I'm going to be an official in the future. Wouldn't you be an official's wife then?</p>
<p>Girl: But the old lady says you're very diligent in our house and often make vows about how things will be after we get engaged, how things will be after we get married, etc., but you're all talk and no action, just like politicians dealing with the people.</p>
<h3>Whispers by the Water and Woods - Talking about Tsinghua</h3>
<p>— Wang Bingwen</p>
<p>Tsinghua University is located west of Ping, formerly Tsinghua Garden. The school is full of towering trees, winding paths, and fragrant streams surrounding the houses. The lotus fragrance overflows. The famous scenic spots include the Guyue Hall and the Gongzi Hall, which were the residences of princes and princesses in the Qing Dynasty. Today, there are great buildings such as the library, the auditorium, the science museum, and the biology museum. Famous works of ancient and modern times are collected here, and professors with learning are gathered here. Studying in this paradise is not bad. This time, Bing was lucky enough to be admitted to reorganize his books and soothe his longing for the past three years. Although the family could not provide a penny, it was difficult to quench his desire to learn. I have been here for three weeks now. I will talk to you about some miscellaneous things I have seen and heard.</p>
<p>A Joke about Physical Examinations In the school, new students are required to undergo physical examinations in the gymnasium. The cleverer old students gathered more than a dozen people to pretend to be examiners and play pranks. All those who came were stamped with purple marks on their faces and bodies at random, or ordered to run a circle, or ordered to somersault, or ordered to crawl on the ground, or four people pulled their hands and feet back and forth, throwing them on thick cushions. A gentleman heard that he was from Guandong and had not washed his feet for a long time. Therefore, the fake examiner ordered him to do a handstand with his feet raised high and told him to turn around in a circle. At that time, several female students passed by, and the fragrance overflowed. Everyone who heard it laughed and pinched their noses.</p>
<p>Victims of Diplomas There was a gentleman from Sichuan who was refused admission by the school because the school had previously refused to accept diplomas from a certain higher normal school in Sichuan. Therefore, he forged a certificate and took the entrance examination. Fortunately, he was admitted. Later, he saw two students from the same school in Shanghai using diplomas from this school to take the entrance examination and they were also admitted. Therefore, the gentleman again presented his original diploma and the original school sent a telegram to prove it. The school ordered him to withdraw from school because his behavior clearly violated the regulations. The gentleman pleaded for him to be retained, but he was not granted his wish, so he threw himself into the pool and committed suicide at dawn the day before yesterday. Fortunately, the school police and students rescued him and avoided death. Alas, diplomas, alas, practical learning!</p>
<p>[Dragging Corpses] Crazy Dragging corpses is called Toss in English, which originated in America. Tsinghua has a strong foreign flavor, so there is this custom, which is aimed specifically at freshmen and takes place on quiet nights when people are asleep. One or two hundred old students always search for freshmen room by room, grabbing their hands and feet and pulling them back and forth, or slamming them to the ground or throwing them into the air. Those who resist are thrown into the pool or tied to a tree. Some have half of their hair shaved off, and some have their faces painted with various colors. If they usually show off a little or offend them, there are even more pranks. They had already had a taste of it on the night of the freshmen's welcome party, and the fake examination in the former gymnasium was also part of the dragging corpse. The school has not banned it, although it is a habit, so it damages public property. It is heard that there will be large-scale dragging corpses at the Double Tenth Festival and the New Year. If there is good news at that time, I will report it again. It can be said that Toss, also known as dragging corpses is both humorous and abusive.</p>
<h3>Hair Loss Prevention Methods</h3>
<p>— Liang Ji</p>
<p>(1) Use hot and cold water alternately when washing your hair (this method is very beneficial for blood circulation under the scalp).</p>
<p>(2) After washing your hair, be sure to let it dry thoroughly and then add a few drops of hair growth oil.</p>
<p>(3) Add carbonic acid ice to the hair washing water.</p>
<p>(4) It is not advisable to overuse the brain (therefore, most literary and art circles and important officials of various agencies have bald hair).</p>
<p>(5) It is not advisable to wear hats often.</p>
<p>(6) Head sweat should be washed frequently or wiped clean, because sweating is most harmful to hair (the reason why athletes and army soldiers have more bald hair is that they sweat too much).</p>
<p>(7) Hair should be combed often.</p>
<h3>Spring Orchids and Autumn Chrysanthemums</h3>
<p>— Liu Henwo</p>
<p>It has been half a year since I left the old capital. The singing of the troupe lingers in my ears. Looking north to Yanyun, my heart and spirit wander. My friend Yao Xingji has long shared a common hobby. I write to share news of the chrysanthemums in autumn, recording a thing or two for the enjoyment of all.</p>
<p>The old fellow villager, Mr. Sun Juxian, once appeared on stage in Shanghai, then returned to Tianjin and retired to his home. Recently, he went to Peiping, first with talk of performing at Huale, but then suddenly changed to perform at Jixiang for two nights. Huang Guiqiu, Jin Zhongren, Ma Fulu, and other actors will be paired with him. It is said that Sun is willing to do his duty, not taking a penny of his personal income, and donating it all to charitable organizations. His courage to do good is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Since the Fuliancheng Opera School changed its affiliation to Jixiang last winter and began performing evening shows, the audience has been consistently large, regardless of weather. This is partly because the prices are very low, so the expense is minimal, and partly because the talent is outstanding, with young performers making their mark. As a result, many connoisseurs flock to it. Recently, they performed the play "The Great Cui Ping Mountain." Gao Shenglin played Shi Xiu, Ye Shengzhang played Pan Zhang, and Liu Shenglian played Pan Qiaoyun. Their perfect combination was unparalleled for a time.</p>
<p>Xin Yanqiu and Yang Xiaolou collaborated at the Kaiming Theater, and each performance was incredibly crowded. Now they have parted ways. Xin Yanqiu has teamed up with Wu Tie'an and Ru Fulan to perform at Jixiang, and she has her own appeal, so the audience is also quite good. Yang Xiaolou, on the other hand, is performing at the Xin Guan Theater in Harbin with Yang Baozhong and Kunqu opera actress Pang Shiqi. Pang's skills are still promising, and she is a rising star. She used to live and sing in Tianjin, where her reputation was also good. However, she indulged in self-abandonment, indulging in cosmetics and causing her reputation to be ruined. Now that she is behaving well, the number of admirers is increasing day by day, and her reputation is restored. She is truly a child who can be taught.</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang, due to the special requests from all parties, had to dedicate himself to the stage again. On the night of the Double Tenth Festival, he performed the first two acts of "Rainbow Pass" at the Zhonghe Theater. The following evening, he performed "Lian Jin Feng." Starting next Friday, he will perform three consecutive nights at the Kaiming Theater, premiering "Goddess of the Luo River" on Friday, "Wu Zhaoguan" on Saturday, and "Assassinating the Tiger" on Sunday night. Tickets are sold out in advance each time, demonstrating his exceptionally strong appeal. Mei is truly a darling of heaven.</p>
<p>Gao Meilan, a Kun opera actress in Peiping, is the one I admire the most. Meilan is charming and alluring. Her performances, such as "The Happy Union" and "The New An County," flawlessly and vividly depict every detail. In late spring, she was invited to Tianjin, but I heard that she was depressed and unsuccessful, and quietly returned to Peiping. She performed once, but now there is no news, and there is no way to hear from her. We are both on the same path, and I cannot help but feel regret.</p>
<p>Since autumn, famous actors have gathered, and talent is abundant. Apart from Cheng Yanqiu and Wang Shaolou in Shanghai, Wang Youchen is collaborating with Shang Heyu, Yan Jupeng and Wolunjushi are alternating performances at Huale, Xun Huisheng and Guan Dayuan are at Jixiang, Xu Biyun and Li Wanchun and Gao Qingkui and Wu Yanheng are performing at Kaiming, and Ma Lianliang and Wang Youqing are competing to create new sounds at the Zhonghe Theater, using their appeal to attract audiences. The people of Peiping are truly fortunate.</p>
<h3>Psychological Test of Eating Crabs</h3>
<p>— Bi Weng</p>
<p>The chrysanthemums bloom in profusion, and there is a banquet in the elegant study. Holding the plump and delicious crabs while drinking wine, the laughter and chatter fill the room. Then, everyone cites stories, each recounting tales. Some praise the lofty integrity of Shoukecao, others present the refined friendship of Hongyou. Finally, they discuss the imposing spirit of the "General of the Horizontal Walk," each uttering elegant and moving words. I then raise my glass and say, "Gentlemen, your discussions are lively, drawing from the essence of storytelling and collecting the historical events of famous people. It is truly admirable. I, an unworthy person, have heard that psychologists have a test for eating crabs, and their words can also be used for a moment of study. I wonder if you gentlemen would like to hear it?" Everyone said they would. I took a full drink and said (the following are all the words of the psychologist): "When eating crabs, if one starts by peeling open the crab box (that is, the crab shell) to eat it greedily, and only touches the claws and legs at the end, or discards the claws and legs and then splits open the crab box again, that person must be brave and aggressive and can be consulted for advancement. His fault lies in being greedy for success and disregarding the consequences. There are also those who eat the claws and legs slowly first, and then open the crab box at the end. That person must be cautious and like to save. His fault is always being slow and lagging behind others in everything. There are also those who see others getting fat crabs with red paste filling the box, and without saying a word, constantly look at them with greedy eyes. That person must be greedy and jealous. There are also those who chew the second and third segments of the crab legs completely. That person is calculating and will not give up even a small profit, and can be engaged in small-scale operations but cannot be entrusted with important matters." I also said, "I have some omissions and cannot describe everything in detail. Gentlemen, please study this further and see what you think." Then some smiled, some nodded, and some said it was not necessarily true. I also thought, this is probably the psychology of the listeners, is it not?</p>
<h3>Travelogue of the South Seas (65)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the second day, Mr. Zong Jiu'an hired a carriage to visit Little Famous Mountain, which is a mountain near the old palace. There are many temples on the mountain, and I heard that there are thousands of monks. The twin lions at the temple gate are more than four feet tall. I have never seen them in China, but people say they are made of clay, not stone. I only climbed to the second level of the mountain and saw that the lecture hall was painted with Buddha stories. I did not bother to go up again because I had to take off my shoes, which was very inconvenient. This is also why they do not evolve and adhere to this fixed habit. Must one take off one's shoes to respect the Buddha? The British are cunning and can govern their country, change their religious practices, and capture their king, but they only respect the custom of taking off shoes. The Burmese also proudly boast about this. It is a pity. There is a strange custom here, which is free cattle. Free cattle are those released by people who practice life release, like we release fish and turtles. The local people release cattle. Their method is to buy a cow and let it eat grass and roam the towns freely without making it work or killing it. This cow can be identified by the fact that its body has no marks from being harnessed. One can take its milk, or one may not. But it is limited to cows because releasing bulls may hurt people, so it is not convenient to let them be free. This also proves the principle that males should not be free, while females can be slightly free. Walking in the city, I saw a strolling cow coming towards me, which was a free cow. I often asked the local people, "If people catch, steal, or kill this cow, what will you do?" They replied, "Releasing it means giving it away, like we give money in the market. Once given, we don't ask about it anymore. However, in our country, very few free cows are stolen or killed." I lamented that their morality is difficult to reach and cannot be achieved in a non-Buddhist country. Generally, those who release free cattle are mostly Kala people (a type of Indian). They are vegetarians, abstain from eating blood, respect cattle, and worship cattle, so they release them. I often say that the nature of evil people is not as good as the nature of dogs, because dogs are loyal to their masters and never betray or bite back. And the nature of dogs is not as good as the nature of cattle. Most of our diet relies on the strength of cattle, so killing cattle is truly not knowing how to repay kindness. Indians worship cattle, which also makes sense. It is a pity that the most charitable nation is also the poorest. People say that the person who repaired my feet before was another race that only eats beans and abstains from eating blood. There is also a sect that worships the sun. I saw them facing the sun in the morning, bowing and offering water. They are also poor people.</p>
<p>There are yellow-skinned sheep with long ears and large tails. The women carry water on their heads with jugs, which is a local custom. I recorded it in a poem:</p>
<p>Free cattle chasing, sheep with long ears, women carrying water jugs on their heads. Betel nut juice flows all over the ground, twin lions, four feet tall, beside the old palace.</p>
<p>Traveling in Burma, I saw what looked like red bloodstains everywhere on the ground. In China, you would only see them on a battlefield, but here it is not blood, but the betel nut juice that everyone chews and spits on the ground. Everyone here eats betel nut, and their lips and teeth are all blood-red, which makes people afraid. Many overseas Chinese also eat it, and spitting it everywhere after eating is truly not a beautiful sight for the city. The Burmese are very fond of this, even more so than the Chinese are of smoking.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (302)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Tears Wept in All Directions, Heartache for Red Love, Hearts Captured in Every Seat, Lingering for Green Intent</p>
<p>The next day, the young master Yin reported that his mother wanted to deliberately exaggerate the story and use some methods to investigate and find out what was going on. Mrs. Yin also appreciated that her eldest son was indeed capable of investigation. However, this caused a family storm. Mrs. Yin thought that she could be considered strict in controlling her husband, but she never thought that he would make such a big mistake. It would be fine if he just secretly sought pleasure and enjoyed flower wine outside, but he actually took a concubine and set up a separate residence, which was too bold and reckless. At home, he looked silent and inconspicuous. Who knew he was a [cat that catches mice doesn't meow]? People behind my back call me a tigress, and I knew that. But they dared to [pat flies on the tiger's head], which inevitably damages the tiger's prestige. Taking advantage of the fact that the master has not returned from Hangzhou, I must teach him a lesson. So, the next day, Mrs. Yin led her chief of staff, the eldest young master, and a vanguard of horse-drawn carriages, the driver, Gengsheng's nanny, the eldest sister, and a group of women soldiers, heading straight to the small mansion around the corner of Baker Road. Hong Lianxiang lived on one floor, which was quiet and deserted, and only employed an older maid named Xiaomei. When the master was in Shanghai, he would come every night for dinner, and it was still a bit lively. After the master left, it became even quieter. At that time, she was making a pair of slippers for the master to wear at night to pass the long, boring days. But she heard a noisy sound at the back door. It turned out that when Mrs. Yin's army entered the alley, they immediately appointed the rickshaw puller who was sweeping the street as a guide. The guide said that the front door was not open and that they always entered through the back door, which was a small wicket gate. A group of people then poured in like a swarm, as if they were attacking Xianxia Ridge in Zhejiang Province, catching people off guard. Xiaomei was carrying a copper pot and was about to go to fetch hot water. Walking to the escalator, she saw many strong and domineering people entering. Suspecting that they were robbers, she looked again and saw that they were all women. So she thought, "Has a new gang of female robbers emerged in Shanghai?" She quickly picked up the pot and went back upstairs. Just as she reached the middle of the escalator, she was stopped by Mrs. Yin, who said, "Which family lives upstairs?" Xiaomei was frightened and said, "I don't know." Mrs. Yin said, "What is your master's name? How can you not know?" At this time, the guide, a rickshaw puller, couldn't help but say, "Sister Xiaomei, this is the madam of the house!" Mrs. Yin heard this and thought, "What madam again? Disgusting and deserving of death!" She scolded the guide and said, "Don't you talk too much!" Xiaomei heard that the madam of the house had come and finally realized that something big had happened. The tigress had come knocking on the door! She dropped the copper pot in her hand and stumbled, trying to send a message to her mistress. She ran into the room, gasping for breath. Hong Lianxiang was about to ask her what was wrong when she saw a team of women soldiers had already crowded into the room.</p>

<h3>Stagnation of Indian Cotton Sales to China Last Week</h3>
<p>Last week, the futures market was open for business for three days, with limited activity. Until the political situation improves, industry colleagues will continue to restrict their activities. Spot transactions were sluggish, and both local manufacturers and exporters were not actively purchasing. There were slight exports to Europe. As of Friday, 35,000 bales were shipped to Japan. Sales to China are temporarily suspended due to unfavorable exchange rates. The statistics for the past week are attached below (in thousands of bales):</p>

<h3>Downward Trend of River-Down Rice Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, about 40 boats arrived at the Zhabei inland river port. Due to the cloudy weather, sales were lively. The price of new japonica rice was generally fluctuating. Top-grade japonica rice opened at 14.2 yuan, and transactions were brisk. The situation still depends on the weather conditions. The price of early indica rice was stable. Due to the scarcity of Yangxian rice, store sales were active, and the price rose by 0.2 yuan. High-quality Yangxian rice opened at 11.3 yuan. Transactions of high-quality Dujian and Bujian rice were slightly better. Although sellers wanted to shout for higher prices, buyers did not agree, so the price only tightened slightly by a few cents. The situation of kejian rice was stable. The market trend was particularly strong due to the scarcity of both high and lower grades. Changes in price were generally not significant.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sources arriving at Hu Nan were continuous, and sales were not good. The main advisors for Changxi New Japonica rice were scarce, and the price of Tianjin rice fell by 0.3 yuan. The same was true for the top-grade rice opening at 14 yuan at the checkpoint and the Sutong White Japonica rice. The downstream market softened by another 0.2 yuan yesterday. The Southern merchants' Zhongbai rice also showed a consistent downward trend. The transportation of this type of rice has already turned sluggish, and production reports are also unfavorable, so the price is gradually decreasing by 0.15 yuan. High-quality rice opened at 13.2-13.3 yuan. Yangxian rice and Dujian rice showed a softening trend, and sales were very quiet. The price was weak at 0.2 yuan. Top-grade Yangxian rice was 10.7 yuan. The market for Baiyuan rice was also quiet due to the scarcity of goods.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Market Rushing Headlong</h3>
<p>A sharp fall and rapid advance with a difference of nine cents. Yesterday, the wheat futures market experienced significant fluctuations in the spot market for the current month after the opening in the morning. Initially, the opening price was 4.46 yuan because it was rumored that the bulls had no intention of taking delivery, so the speculative bulls had to sell off their positions. The price then fell to 4.41 yuan, a sharp drop of 9 cents compared to the closing price of the previous week. However, after the second session, because the factories considered it was so cheap, buying spot goods was not as good as changing the standard, so the market sentiment seemed to turn strong again. By the afternoon opening, because the factories still had to take in, the speculative shorts had no choice but to cover their positions, so the performance continued to improve. By the close of trading, because there were still a few speculative shorts who had not covered their positions, the bulls refused to sell, thus raising the price by six cents. The difference between the highest price and the lowest price in the morning was as high as 1.9 cents. The fierce competition between the two sides was evident. (It was reported that Fuxin had to take delivery of 35-36 cars). The initial prices for the distant months were also very flat, but because the recent sharp rise also brought them up. As a result, the current month rose by 9 cents compared to the previous week, November rose slightly by 1 cent, December rose slightly by 2 cents, January rose slightly by 1 cent, February rose slightly by 2 cents, and March rose slightly by 3 cents.</p>
<h3>Flour Futures: Near-Term Declines, Distant-Term Gains</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices for each month decreased by 3-5 cents due to the lower Yang Deng quotations, so the market sentiment was weak. The near and distant terms were about 1 cent lower than the closing price of the previous week. By the afternoon opening, the current month was not very good because the demand from the merchants was not smooth due to the approaching delivery. The distant terms, on the other hand, rebounded because Biao Zhen returned and the inland short sellers were eager to cover their positions. As a result, each month rebounded by about 1.5 cents compared to the lowest price in the morning. Looking at the future situation, if the demand from the merchants is slightly active in the current month, it is feared that it will still have to rebound to the 3-cent mark. Because the spot price is generally required to open at a high of 3 cents, then it can be seen that it is still very tight at 3.2-3.3 cents. As a result, the current month was down 0.05 cents compared to the previous week, November and December were up 0.5 cents, January was up 0.75 cents, February was up 1 cent, and March was up 0.75 cents.</p>
<h3>客秈 Southern Route Sales Turn Active</h3>
<p>Jiangxi machine early rise of 0.3 yuan. Yesterday, the situation of purchasing Ke Xian rice on the southern route was quite promising. The amount of early Jiangxi machine rice arriving and in stock was small, so it was welcomed by the Fuzhou and Xiamen merchants, and the price immediately rose by about 0.3 yuan. The transaction volume of other rice was very small, and the price was also flat. Apart from the various merchants on the southern route, the sales volume in this street and the north were weak. The unified market price for early Jiangxi machine rice was 1,500 bags, priced at 11 yuan to 10.25 yuan. Nanjing machine rice was 200 bags, priced at 9.2 yuan. Also, brown rice was 150 bags, priced at 7.85 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Stagnant Sales and Price Decline of Guangdong Silk in New York</h3>
<p>Due to the surprisingly cheap opening price of Japanese silk, the price has fallen by more than 0.1-0.2 yuan. Recently, due to the severe cold weather in the New York market, no one is asking about silk fabrics, and the silk factories are piling up inventory. There is no appetite for raw silk materials. Due to the surprisingly cheap opening price of Japanese silk, the Guangdong silk factories are increasingly sluggish in purchasing, and the price has fallen by more than 0.1-0.2 yuan. At the end of last week, fine grade Guangdong silk was only priced at US$1.31 per pound, and coarse grade was priced at US$1.02.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Laver Price Breaks Old Records</h3>
<p>The source of laver from Japan is scarce, resulting in insufficient supply to meet demand, so the price has soared, breaking old records. Yesterday, the number plate sale price of glass laver was raised to 227.8 taels for three pieces. Nagasaki goods sold for 125 taels for large squares, 110 taels for medium squares, and 87.8 taels for small squares. The bottom goods are also depleted. Currently, it is impossible to find any goods for purchase. However, the domestic Ningbo goods have a better harvest this year than last year. Goods from Daishan and Qushan have arrived recently, so although Japanese goods are scarce, fortunately, domestic goods can be used to offset the shortage. The demand from merchants is not expected to be cut off. The market price is high at 105 taels, and ordinary price is 92-85 taels. However, most of the goods that have arrived are rough and the quality is good, but the color is not very elegant. It is hoped that the Chinese people will quickly improve it.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Minghua Sugar Sales Are Quite Strong</h3>
<p>The spot market is declining. Yesterday, the sugar market's production area telegram had few arrivals. The exchange's market for coarse sand white sugar was still quiet, and the price was 7.75 taels. The market image was still strong. No. 20 medium sand white sugar was 6.8 taels, and finely ground sand white sugar was 7.8 taels. There was little demand. Taikoo B Mark was 7.95 taels, and the transaction was active. In fact, the buying office sold goods at a price of 8 taels. It was also heard that the foreign firm sold over a thousand bags of that day's goods of B Mark at a price of 6.75 taels. Newly taxed sugar seemed unremarkable. The price of Japanese sugar turned softer as Minghua factory's shipments were quite strong. YT Mark was 7.6 taels, YP Mark was 7.85 taels, YRO Mark was 7.3 taels, N Mark was 7.825 taels, and J Mark was 8.1 taels. The market image was flat because the actual sales remained sluggish. Hua Xin company sold offloaded Dutch sugar of No. 24 coarse sand white sugar at the end of the month for 500 tons at a price of 5.875 Dutch guilders. The newly taxed market image was still strong. Taikoo BA Mark five-temperature sugar had been out of stock in recent days. Yesterday, 300 bags finally arrived, priced at 11.08 yuan. The market seemed flat and tired. If there was a large number of sales needed, the company was quite willing to accommodate to meet the needs of customers. The ice train was also out of stock, but it would arrive soon to meet market demand.</p>
<h3>疋頭市 The Piece Goods Market with Fluctuations</h3>
<p>The 本廠 cotton cloth market remained chaotic yesterday. Fine cloth fell another five cents. Yanghe only sold for 6.6 taels. Lan Shuangyu, Laba, and Tong were all 6.65 taels. Caiqiu was 6.7 taels. Lanji was 6.55 taels, mainly because of sluggish sales. The spot goods for fine twill were still scarce, only falling 2.5 cents. Tanghe was 7.3 taels. Lan Shuangyu was 6.975 taels. Hubei Tianzi coarse cloth became more and more expensive. Yesterday, it was still difficult to purchase spot goods at 8.5 taels. Sixteen-pound cloth also rose accordingly. Wuhe opened at 7.35 taels. Mudan was 7.425 taels. Wulao was 7.25 taels.</p>
<p>The prices of 疋頭 east and west were uncertain. The reason was that the National Government ordered the closing of accounts at the end of the Gregorian calendar year, and the needs of the native customers were no longer as smooth as before. Yesterday, Yuehua velvet medium flower fell by 0.25 cents. Fuhua was 2.025 yuan. Yang Guiji company opened at 2 yuan. The shui lang velvet was also soft. Shuanglong was 2.275 yuan. Yuxian Jiao book was 2.25 yuan. The lowest price for printed velvet was only 2 yuan. The ones with better 花 were 2.15 yuan. Cai Ge velvet also gradually declined. Ke Ai Meiren Mei Junzi was 2.2 yuan. Fine zhigong, fine bi, still had rising prices and no falling prices. Xi Huo 放 zhigong ni rose again and now requires 2.675 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Huisi Iron Set to Ship 200 Tons</h3>
<p>The transaction of 200-pound Huisi iron has been very fresh recently. The reason is that the needs of each factory have fallen, so the trend is extremely sluggish. The market depends on the frequent decline in foreign exchange rates to maintain its position. Currently, the estimated price of each box in the market is 22 taels, and the slightly inferior colors can also be sold for 21.5 taels. It is heard that the supply of goods in the market has become limited recently, so some industry colleagues are very interested in ordering goods from overseas. Therefore, yesterday, companies such as Weili and Yu had already made 200 tons (2,240 boxes), with a price of 7.16 gold yuan per box, and they were being shipped from Mingzheng to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Xinghua Zheng Er Rises Again by 0.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>The third batch of Xinghua longan has now arrived, totaling 3,000 boxes. It is reported that although the harvest in that area this year is abundant, the number of genuine large-sized high-quality goods is not large, so the publicly agreed price of this batch of Jiechun Zheng Er is increased by another 2 taels compared to the previous market. The prices of other brands are reduced accordingly. However, the ordinary goods are not odd and are sold to accommodate the medium grade. Brands such as Xingji are still sold at the original price without an increase. It seems that there is a phenomenon of raising prices and then lowering them in the market. According to Quanzhou telegram, the stock of high-grade longan on the ground is scarce and sellers are unwilling to sell them cheaply. Subsequent boats have stopped loading.</p>

After applying it, one can enjoy the pleasure of snow-white skin and a face as beautiful as a virgin. Therefore, it is named "Sixteen-Year-Old Little Girl," perfectly matching its name and reality.

<p>Sincere Company declares that the German Marta Pharmaceutical Factory's Lion Brand Beef Extract, sold by our company, has been favored by high-society individuals since its distribution in China. This is because the beef extract functions to enhance essence, benefit marrow, nourish the brain, strengthen blood, and especially tonify the stomach, making it an unparalleled remedy for patients and those with weak constitutions. Due to high demand, it has been out of stock for over a month. Three hundred more boxes have already arrived.

<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>The Social Film Company declares that the internal procedures for the large-scale martial arts romance film "Flower of Society," prepared by our company, have been finalized. The film has already begun shooting a few weeks ago. However, due to director Cai Qianyun's particular caution, he went to Hangzhou again to select exterior locations. The scenery required for the film must be both elegant and include towering mountains, which is essential to match the plot. This was not easy to find. Mr. Cai returned yesterday and approved that the important actors, screenwriter Li Tiantian, producer Wu Beihuan, and renowned photography optical technician Li Dusheng, who returned from Japan, would leave for Hangzhou on the first of next month to shoot exterior scenes.</p>
<p>Fudan Film Company declares that the new fourth installment of "Burning the Seven-Star Tower" will premiere at the Central Grand Theatre on the 30th of this month. This installment tells the story of the demonic priest Tai Xu, who, in order to complete his primordial creation, deceives young boys and girls from Yun Village, located at the foot of Lingfeng Mountain, and sets fire to the entire village. In the midst of the raging flames, the demonic priest encounters the warrior Yan Qiu, who rescues a young girl and engages in a fierce battle of magic with the priest. White light and sword shadows flash, making for a spectacular scene. Eventually, Yan Qiu pushes the demonic priest into an ancient well and travels away with the young girl. The role of the young girl is played by the famous actress Ms. Hu Shan, who gives a moving performance in the scenes of sorrow and separation, making it a rare treat. The role of Yan Qiu is played by Luo Keming, the only martial arts star of the era. Young, brave, and handsome, he can be compared to the Western actor Douglas Fairbanks. In this installment, his performance of jumping over walls to save the girl and boxing the demonic priest is unique and cannot be imitated by ordinary people. The role of the demonic priest is played by Qu Yifeng, a veteran actor who makes the audience forget their weariness. The roles of the old man and the old woman are played by Ye Yisheng and Wang Xieyan, who are among the most famous figures in modern Chinese cinema. Ye plays the old man, Wang plays the old woman, and their depiction of jealousy and infighting is detailed, thorough, and unprecedented in the history of film. All aspects of this installment are directed by Yu Boyan, who has spent considerable effort and money in producing it. He claims that this is his most satisfying work, even more spectacular than the previous three installments. With the premiere approaching, all sectors are urged to pay attention to it.</p>

<p>That evening at Ou's house, I was with colleagues from the Ampelopsis Literary Society.</p>
<p>After Ou introduced me to the friends he was meeting for the first time, he busily walked away. He brought out all his instruments – guitar, mandolin, ukulele. His wife and sister also came out, and a concert began.</p>
<p>Ou, a Cantonese, has lived in Harbin for over ten years. He is a medical student. His whole family – father, mother, him, and his sister – are all doctors. However, he seems to have a stronger interest in studying art. He studied painting for three or four years, and he studied guitar with a Russian musician for six years. He is also the most hardworking member of the Ampelopsis Literary Society. Yet, everyone knows that he is a medical student.</p>
<p>He has a White Gull String Ensemble. They began playing that evening, treating their friends with music. The friends were all happy to socialize with him.</p>
<p>He sometimes plays the guitar. The guitar is a very complex stringed instrument. This instrument was very popular in medieval Europe, but it is still very popular in Russia today. There is a Russian song that says, "I don't want anything, I only want wine, virgins, and guitars." The guitars commonly used in Russia have seven strings, while those in the United States and the United Kingdom have six strings, and the playing method is also different. Russians hold the guitar while playing, while Americans and British people place it on their laps. In Harbin, it is the Russian style; in Shanghai, it is the American style. He uses the guitar to replace the piano. His sister and wife both play the mandolin or banjo. Sometimes he plays the violin, and Zhao also joins their string ensemble to help out because there are not enough people.</p>
<p>Ping, Qing, Wen, and Luo were late. Everyone asked them the reason for their lateness.</p>
<p>"Ah, we watched the nationally sensational female sprinter Ms. Sun Guiyun at the sports field today," said Luo.</p>
<p>"Don't mention it, everything was ruined by you," said Ping. "Wen, you report to them."</p>
<p>"Qing, report."</p>
<p>"Okay," said Qing, unable to stop laughing. "We went to the sports field today, naturally to see Ms. Sun Guiyun. Coincidentally, after the workout, we met Ms. Sun's brother. When his sister was about to leave the field with the team, he shouted, 'Sister, come here, let me introduce you to a few friends.' We were so excited that our hearts were pounding. Ms. Sun did not jump, she ran over with her race running steps. Luo was the first. She nodded to Luo, but everything was ruined by him. We all thought that when he returned the salute, he would extend a hand, so we could all touch the skin of the female athlete. Who knew that Luo was so anxious that he even forgot to take off his hat. Naturally, Ping was second, Wen was fourth, and I was the last. How could I break the ice? So everyone was silent for a while. Ms. Sun became impatient and ran back to the team using her race running steps. But this female athlete's brother kept talking to us endlessly. This is the reason for our lateness."</p>
<p>Everyone burst into laughter.</p>
<p>"How did you all become country bumpkins when you saw the famous female athlete?"</p>
<p>Ou continued to play the guitar.</p>
<h3>Autumn Rain Night</h3>
<p>— Shao Zhen</p>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>That day, in addition to curry chicken, we also ate three kinds of our favorite side dishes, costing more than two yuan in total. When it was time to pay, Rong took out a letter from his pocket along with the money. I suddenly became nervous, thinking it was another love letter sent to him by some woman. I hurriedly reached out to snatch the letter and suddenly said, "Who sent this to you?"</p>
<p>Rong saw my flustered expression and looked at me with a smile, then handed me the letter.</p>
<p>"I don't know who sent me these two complimentary tickets to the New Oriental Theater."</p>
<p>I took them and felt my cheeks burning, heating up from the corners of my eyes to my ears. I regretted my rashness and wrongly suspected my dear Rong. I couldn't help but feel embarrassed and forced a smile to cover up my shame, but Rong's attitude was as gentle and silent as ever. I found Rong even more lovable.</p>
<p>"Improved national opera is the need of the times. Let's go see it together," I said, toying with the two complimentary tickets.</p>
<p>"Okay, we need literary drama, which is originally one of the arts. We also need nationalistic drama. This era should have such a movement. We have to see if their movement conditions meet the needs of the times."</p>
<p>"They are performing the opera 'Wang Zhaojun' and 'Female Escort' today. I saw their advertisement on the back of the newspaper this morning, which described it in glowing terms. I don't know if their 'Wang Zhaojun' is like the Cantonese opera called 'Zhaojun's Lament'."</p>
<p>"Then we must first know whether their material is based on official history or legends. But based on my personal speculation, their material will probably have similarities with the Cantonese opera 'Zhaojun's Lament', because the Cantonese opera 'Zhaojun's Lament' is based on legendary stories that are sad and moving, easily arousing the sympathy of the audience. They will not go beyond this scope."</p>
<p>"Then the New Oriental's 'Wang Zhaojun' is bound to arouse the sympathy of the audience."</p>
<p>"It's hard to say. Perhaps the story is sad and moving, but the artistic skill of the performance may be too mediocre, and the story may be burdened by it. My words are based on general observations. We Chinese fundamentally lack dramatic talent. For example, although my group of friends who love literature and art have written many valuable articles, they have rarely contributed to drama. From this example, you can imagine it. Of course, it cannot be completely denied. Perhaps the New Oriental's 'Wang Zhaojun' is a strong bud of the opera movement. It's not too early, let's go see it first and then talk."</p>
<p>So we left the New Asia and walked to the New Oriental. It was the time when it was being performed.</p>
<p>The New Oriental was previously a Japanese performance hall. We had been there once more than ten years ago. Although the impression was not very bad, it was not very good either. This time, it has been completely painted and looks brand new on the outside. However, everything still retains the remnants of the old habits of the Chinese Peking opera hall, such as tea and hot towels.</p>
<p>"Wang Zhaojun" was being performed. The lyrics, lines, sets, and costumes were indeed different from the old opera. But I always felt a little uncomfortable. I asked Rong, "What do you think?"</p>
<p>"It's still passable. It's considered a step forward. But we have to forgive them. This is their debut and the time is short. According to their own words in the first issue of 'Drama', there are certainly many flaws. If we want to see mature works in drama, they still have to go through several times of effort and movement."</p>
<p>"Have you read the first issue of 'Drama'?"</p>
<p>"I flipped through a few pages at a friend's house, but I didn't read the whole thing. I only read the articles by Zhu Jun and Xiang Jun."</p>
<p>"Do they both have works in it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Zhu Jun's article speaks from a national standpoint, and Xiang Jun's is a piece of textual research art work. Both articles are worth reading."</p>
<p>"Do they have any criticisms of this 'Wang Zhaojun'?"</p>
<p>"No, they hadn't seen this 'Wang Zhaojun' when they were writing the articles."</p>
<p>"Then what criticisms do you have of it?"</p>
<p>"You can say I have them, and you can say I don't. I just said it's still passable and considered a step forward, which is my criticism of the whole play."</p>
<p>"What opinions do you have on Li Lianli?"</p>
<p>"I don't understand her background at all, but she seems to be Cantonese and seems to have a considerable knowledge of Cantonese opera."</p>
<p>"How do you estimate she is Cantonese?"</p>
<p>"Because she has the face of a Cantonese."</p>
<p>At this point, "Female Escort" came on stage. This play uses the tune of Peking opera, but the plot is different from Peking opera. This is because there are more twists and turns and more interspersed. Min Cuiying really makes me express my support. The appearance is of course very good, and in the performance, all the love, resentment, sadness, pain, and bitterness of Su San in the play are conveyed vividly. Although the noise is low, the singing is just like a yellow oriole singing softly. This is enough to make people linger and appreciate it. I asked Rong how this play was. He said that it may be because there was imitation, so it was more powerful than "Wang Zhaojun" in shaking people's inner feelings, especially easily arousing the inner resonance of yielding Eastern women. However, in terms of subject matter, Wang Zhaojun is ten thousand times better than it. If they do not hesitate to carefully revise the script of Wang Zhaojun and rearrange it, giving drama a new life and giving the decadent nation a powerful warning, then the Female Escort can be omitted.</p>
<p>"But I think it's okay for the 'Female Escort' to be performed at the New Oriental with Min Cuiying, because the 'Female Escort' was originally a very famous old play, but it's fragmented and outdated, and life has been lost. The New Oriental is called an art performance place that improves national opera, so it's a good thing to give it a new life and let Min Cuiying be its soul. Look at Min Cuiying, what a lovely young and beautiful girl! Although there is room for criticism in the performance, this relationship is completely due to her young age and lack of cultivation. If time is given, this 'Female Escort' will naturally give the world a deep understanding through her unique talent and future cultivation. That is, I already like 'Female Escort' and dislike 'Wang Zhaojun' here."</p>
<p>"Your words, your likes are all right, and naturally I also express sympathy. However, the reason why I had the previous sentence is because the subject matter of 'Wang Zhaojun' is much better than 'Female Escort'. However, the reason why it is good has already been explained before, and there is no need to explain it now. Forget it, don't keep nagging and lose the play without watching it. Look at Min Cuiying, how beautiful is her dangling nose!"</p>
<p>"Well, her big black eyes are also very good. Her small mouth, vermilion lips, and teeth are all good."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, a sudden and heavy wave of sound outside the field caused infinite tension among the audience in the whole field. Everyone looked out the window. It turned out that the autumn rain was pouring down on the world, making the four seats in the whole field feel cool and desolate. When the gongs stopped and the curtain was lowered, the sound tide was surging, and the audience then left the field and dispersed like birds and beasts. At the time of the torrential rain, the rickshaw pullers were asking for a strange price, and they could not be discussed. We spent six dimes in the rain in the autumn rain on the way home.</p>
<p>After returning home and taking off my wet clothes, I couldn't help but sigh and say, "Ah, the night of autumn rain."</p>
<h3>Special Issue in Commemoration of the Fifth Anniversary of Fudan University</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>"News World" is the most abundant. The joyous and encouraging fifth anniversary of Fudan University passed happily in the midst of celebrations. This grand commemorative ceremony, the first awarding of honorary degrees, and the dazzling recreational activities are all worthy of leaving commemorative traces in writing. Especially the various large and small publications published by various departments are dazzling and beautiful. For example, Fudan Five-Day Publication published ("Special Issue in Celebration of the 25th Anniversary"), the Department of Journalism published ("News World"), and other departments such as the Department of Chinese Literature, the School of Business, and the Department of Chemistry all published commemorative special issues to express their warm congratulations. This is of course of profound significance and worthy of the attention of teachers, students, alumni, and guests of the school. The most abundant content is the former two, especially the "News World" edited by the Journalism Society.</p>
<p>"News World" is a quarterly magazine. The inaugural issue is to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Fudan University. This is really a win-win situation. The articles in it are as precious as pearls because articles on journalism are very rare in China, and specialized research on journalism is really (there is Yanjing in the north and Fudan in the south) in domestic universities. This cannot be denied. This issue of "News World" contains ten important articles, such as Guo Zhenyi's News Paper Etiquette, Huang Tianpeng's Jiang Zuo Li Feng for Twenty-Five Years, Shu Ming's Talking about Our Department of Journalism from Celebrating the 25th Anniversary of Our School, Xie Liuyi's Importance and Facilities of News Education, Guo Butao's Only Fatal Injury to the Chinese Press Today, Shen Huanzong's Translation of the Era of News Enterprises, Du Shaowen's Our Country's Press under the Control of the News Policy of the Great Powers, Wang Deliang's My Views on Adding a Picture Biweekly to the Shanghai Times News, Huang Huanruo's Importance and Methods of Extracurricular Research in Journalism, and Li Xing's Talking about Big Newspapers from Small Newspapers. These articles can all be used as a reference for those who aspire to study journalism, especially Director Xie's long essay of about 10,000 words can also be of great help to experts in running journalism, because of its</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>The facilities and equipment have been reformed several times by Director Xie to run the Department of Journalism at Fudan University, and only now has it been successful. Because of this important article, many guests admired it, so this "News World" sold more than 100 copies in the midst of the grand commemoration.</p>
<p>There is also a single-color painting at the beginning of the article, which is said to be painted by a female student. It says (This is the most beautiful journalism department among the fruits harvested in the past 25 years). From this, you can see a glimpse of the meaning implied in the book. The editors are Tang Zenghuang, Du Shaowen, Huang Huanruo, Wang Deliang, etc.</p>
<p>Other publications, such as the Fudan Bulletin Board, which is popular throughout the school, also published special issues to celebrate the grand and meaningful 25th anniversary, among which Xi Sheng, etc. were the most brilliant. This is also recognized by everyone. Finished.</p>
<h3>Law Society of the School of Law</h3>
<p>Holds a Discussion</p>
<p>The Law Society of the School of Law is a purely academic research group. Not only is it praised by the students, but the authorities of the school also express considerable satisfaction with it. The number of members increased sharply during the re-election conference this semester. Now they are still joining one after another. In addition to the old members from the previous semester, more than 80 people have joined this semester. The club's work should be even more advanced. Following the request of the majority of members, in order to expand academic research, in addition to the political, legal, and economic research groups, there are also many special committees such as lecture meetings and litigation practice groups.</p>
<p>In addition, the club's publication ("Law Light") has been published to the third issue, and the fourth issue is being concentrated and will be published soon. Other activities such as lecture meetings and litigation practice groups have also been held one after another. It is learned that the club held its first discussion at 7 pm last night in the sixth classroom and invited Dean Shen Hengshan and Professor Zhang Yunfu to the meeting to guide. First, Zhang Ming, the standing committee member of the Law Society, reported briefly (Today's discussion is convened by the political group. It should have been chaired by classmate Zhou Yuegao, but Mr. Zhou returned home due to important matters. Now, please ask Shen Deji, the director of the law group, to act as the agent.) In addition to stating the topic, Mr. Shen also said that he was very honored to be able to invite Mr. Shen and Mr. Zhang to the meeting to guide. As a result, the two gentlemen can give us criticisms and guidance so that we can get a real understanding. This is our happiest moment. At the same time, the students and members attended on time and were all gathered together. This kind of spirit is indeed worthy of reading. Now, in order to save time, please start the discussion.</p>
<p>First, Zhang Mingjun expressed his opinions, followed by Ms. Han Jinlu, Mr. Chen Anshu, Ms. Jin Guangmei, Mr. Li Yaochun, etc., who discussed one after another and expressed their opinions. Then, Mr. Shen and the two gentlemen were invited to guide. The meeting lasted for three hours. By the time it was dismissed, the clock had already struck ten. (Yi De)</p>
<h3>Autumn at Mandarin Duck Lake</h3>
<p>— Wen Juan</p>
<p>I felt mentally exhausted from burying myself in work all day, so I proposed going to Mandarin Duck Lake, because this place is right on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, so it's convenient to travel to and from. Moreover, Wei is a native of Jiaxing, so with her leading the way, we don't have to worry about running into unfamiliar obstacles. During the Double Tenth Festival holiday, the four of us set off with our luggage.</p>
<p>Sitting in the train, in less than two and a half hours, we could already see a picturesque scene of smoke and waves quietly unfolding in front of us. This is the famous Mandarin Duck Lake outside Jiaxing City, also called South Lake, which is considered one of the famous scenic spots in western Zhejiang.</p>
<p>We got off the train, and Wei went to hire a boat first. Bing and I managed the rattan basket and camera tripod, etc. Qing went to buy some snacks. The boat was hired, it was an old woman's boat, and the price was only three dimes to go directly to Yanyu Tower. If it was a girl's boat, it would be more expensive, at least one yuan. The more beautiful the girl's face, the more expensive the boat price. The same waterway could cost more than five or six yuan. We are not philandering playboys, so an old woman is fine, as long as her boat doesn't break. However, it was thanks to Wei being a local that she knew these tricks and was not fooled, otherwise we would have spent more money.</p>
<p>Everyone got on the boat and swayed into the heart of the waves. Looking at the distant water, the smoke connected to the sky. Here and there, patches of water chestnut flowers blocked the way. The boat lady turned left and right and moved forward through the designated waterway.</p>
<p>The boat arrived at Yanyu Tower. We went ashore and chose a relatively secluded pavilion to sit down. The waiter brewed tea and served small dishes of melon seeds and peanuts, as well as two dishes of (shaomai). This shaomai is a local specialty. It is said that all the shaomai within two or three hundred miles of the surrounding area are not as good as theirs. I think this may be an exaggeration. So I tasted one, and it tasted like crab roe, which was indeed not bad.</p>
<p>Looking down at the embankment, in the middle of the scattered wild trees, there are many morning glory vines interspersed with red flowers and green leaves. These vines climb from one tree to another, creating countless domes and barriers. These vines flutter their long strips and thin leaves, as if they were artificially tied together. Looking at the shore from a distance, the water hyacinth flowers and red reeds formed a team, extending along the lake to an unknown end. The water is endless, and these embroidered clothes are also endless. The greatness of nature is really not something that we small people can measure.</p>
<p>I had been to this Yanyu Tower once, but it was many years ago. The scenery is still the same, but our youth has flown away secretly. Just as I was lamenting by the railing, something was stuffed into my mouth. It was a peeled fresh water chestnut. Wei laughed and said,</p>
<p>(I got you! It's the one without the second skin removed. Don't you feel astringent?)</p>
<p>I quickly spat it out and felt a little astringent in my mouth. So I no longer grieved over the past and sat down with them to eat water chestnuts. After eating for a while, Qing suddenly clamored to eat cooked pot water chestnuts. It turned out that she was also proficient in this way. A plate of emerald green, steaming hot cooked water chestnuts was brought up. The copper pot water chestnuts were really delicious, glutinous, and soft, showing the gentle flavor of Jiangnan.</p>
<p>(This is the representative of Jiaxing people. They are soft and easily conquered.) Before Bing finished speaking, a handful of water chestnut shells landed on her face. She escaped from the pavilion and slipped into the artificial cave to complete her work of conquering the Jiaxing people.</p>
<p>After paying for the tea, we got back on the boat and went to the Little Yanyu Tower on the opposite side. This place is also an island in the lake, but it is much smaller than Yanyu Tower. Apart from a few rows of weeping willows quietly covering an ancient temple, it is almost impossible to find another flower or tree. We tied the boat under the shade of the willows and took out the moon cakes, canned food, bread, etc. that we had brought.</p>
<p>The old boat lady ate the Guangdong mooncakes we gave her and expressed great joy. She also took out a wine bottle from the fire cabin, drank alone, and said,</p>
<p>(This mooncake is perfect with Shaoxing wine, otherwise it would be too sweet.)</p>
<p>From her every chewing action, you can understand the meaning of drama.</p>
<p>Bing was naughty. She wanted to ask the boat lady for wine to drink. We also encouraged her. So one cup after another, she emptied the wine bottle in an instant. Bing was a little drunk. With a clatter, the wine glass fell on the deck. The three of them were making a fuss when they heard a piano sound in the distance. We recognized it as Chopin's Nocturne. Everyone immediately became quiet and listened to him play.</p>
<p>The lonely and melancholic whisper of the night, weak but full of hope. When these sounds were transmitted to our ears through the water surface from the trembling of each sound wave, we only felt that what we heard was not music, but some precious words hidden in the human soul. He was looking forward to it, he was sad, and a kind of gentle passion was scattered in the lonely space.</p>
<p>After the piano sound stopped, everyone recovered from the dreamlike realm. We woke up the boat lady who was dozing off and told her to send us back. Around nine o'clock, the moon was just rising. The waves were calm as a mirror all the way. In the hazy night mist, her infinite beauty and infinite greatness were even more evident. The night scene in autumn is really worth lingering over. No matter what kind of reed it is, it is always full of poetic meaning and touching feelings. The only difference between the sky and the water in front of us is the difference between movement and stillness. We were sitting in the boat and thought we were sailing in the sky.</p>
<p>We took the night train home and unknowingly our clothes were soaked by the cool dew.</p>
<h3>In the Tram</h3>

<p>Book and Newspaper Introduction</p>
<h3>Vanguard Weekly</h3>
<p>— Tang Bin</p>
<p>Issue Seventeen</p>
<p>The most potent advocate for nationalist literature, "Vanguard Weekly," has shown remarkable progress in its content in recent issues, particularly regarding theory and criticism. The contents of issue seventeen include several extremely important and insightful articles: (1) Tang Bingruo's "On Nationalist Poetry," (2) Zheng Jue's critique of "Awakening"'s "Several Attitudes Nationalist Literature Should Avoid," (3) Jin Xuan's two "Talks on the Edge": (A) "Secret," (B) "Cultural Undertakings on Fourth Road," (4) Zheng Bo's translation, "Two Orphans" (continued). All of these articles are worth reading.</p>
<p>According to Jin Xuan in "Editor's Notes," "On Nationalist Poetry" is a lengthy treatise of about ten thousand words. Although only a little over three thousand words are published in this issue, the author provides detailed explanations and analyses of the inevitable causes of nationalist poetry, its artistic expression, and its inherent elements. The author cites the literary forms of the most ancient civilized nations of Europe, the Roman epics "Iliad" and "Odyssey," as well as the oldest folk works of China, the Book of Songs, to prove that poetry in its primitive state was an inevitable product of the actual life of a nation, and definitely not something produced out of idle leisure. From this, it is evident that nationalist poetry has a long history, and its greatness and artistic value are self-evident. At the same time, the author thoroughly elaborates on various issues that should be fundamentally eliminated in the so-called proletarian poetry of today (the poets we need), such as its crude descriptions:</p>
<p>Today, our Chinese nation is suffering from double oppression.</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>Therefore, the poets we need should eliminate self-serving individualism and shout for the future of the entire Chinese nation, exposing to the fullest extent the imperialist aggressive policies in China, awakening the oppressed emerging nations, promoting the already formed folk thought of the Chinese nation, and creating the new life of the Chinese nation. All of these must be expressed through poetry, relying on the great power of modern poets.</p>
<p>Next, the author elaborates on the phrase "shout for the future of the entire Chinese nation." This is, of course, specifically referring to so-called proletarian poetry, but this explanation is also very important in this article.</p>
<p>However, the "shouting" and "exclaiming" mentioned here are by no means the kind of extremely crude descriptions found in the so-called proletarian poetry that was once popular in the Chinese poetry scene, which exclusively uses violence and weapons as the subject matter of poetry, infusing the blood of the Soviet Russian nation into the capillaries of the Chinese nation. This kind of blind fantasy cannot be established in fact, and its cruel descriptions, which fundamentally forget the artistic elements of poetry, cannot move the hearts of readers and be passed down forever. This is an extremely obvious fact.</p>
<p>Regarding this section, the author completely adopts an objective attitude, pointing out the fallacies of proletarian poetry's expression from an artistic perspective. This kind of correct argument is indispensable in constructing a nationalist poetic viewpoint. The following section, "The Formation of Nationalist Poetry," elaborates on the origin of poetry to the fullest extent, with particularly detailed citations of the formation of famous epics from Europe and other regions. Due to space limitations, we will omit the analysis.</p>
<p>The article critiquing "Awakening"'s "Several Attitudes Nationalist Literature Should Avoid" is particularly worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Since its launch on June 1st of this year, the nationalist literature movement has actively attracted the attention of the literary world both at home and abroad. The theory and creation of nationalist literature are now inevitably emerging like an unorthodox force, driven by the historical background and the current social environment. This can be clearly understood by simply observing the "Declaration of the Nationalist Literature Movement." At the same time, because nationalist literature (which in fact already has a solid foundation) has suddenly appeared in the real literary world, it has caused misunderstandings, distortions, slanders, and rabid barking from those who cannot understand the true essence of art and do not understand literary trends, which is, of course, to be expected. For example, an article by Zheng Pingjun, "Several Attitudes Nationalist Literature Should Avoid," which appeared in the October 8th issue of "Awakening," is an unintelligible argument put forward by someone who is blindly ignorant of literary phenomena and trends. Indeed, (he, referring to the author of the article, Zheng Ping, attempts to distort theory, conceal facts, deceive readers, and vigorously slander) it fundamentally fails to provide any correct criticism or understanding of nationalist literature. Zheng Jue's critique is entirely based on the correct theory of nationalist literature, using objective artistic techniques to analyze the absurd arguments, and finally thoroughly elaborating on the significance of nationalist literature. At the same time, it has opened a path for those who are blindly ignorant of literature to understand nationalist literature. Therefore, Zheng Jue's critique occupies an important position in this issue of "Vanguard Weekly," and we sincerely hope that readers will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The other articles are all worthy of our calm appreciation, but due to space constraints, we will refrain from analyzing them one by one.</p>
<h3>Grassland Weekly</h3>
<p>— Nan Xin</p>
<p>Volume Three, Number Eleven</p>
<p>This issue of "Grassland Weekly" is particularly rich and full in content. Although it only publishes six articles, it encompasses everything within the scope of literature and art.</p>
<p>Wang Fen's "Creative Theory of Nationalist Literature" is a concise and insightful treatise. The author begins by using a very concise style to explain the relationship between nationalist literature and the times. Next, the author discusses several unique insights regarding the theory of creation. What is emphasized in literary creation is, of course, the depiction of characters and artistic expression. The author's description of this is very detailed, for example:</p>
<p>The characters in nationalist literary creation are definitely not decadent poets or depraved personalities, but rather ambitious people who can bring glory to the nation. A person who aspires to create constantly radiates their observational power in all directions and brings it to expression in their creations, so there is naturally no fault to be found. In fact, we are fortunate to be born in this era, so we will definitely not lack opportunities to find several personalities worth depicting. On the positive side, there are people who are working hard in the national movement and who are doing their best for the nation, using their own spirits and sacrificing their own bodies. On the negative side, there are also some people who initially fall into depravity and then grow, and some who initially wander and then awaken. In short, to portray individuality, everything directly or indirectly related to the nation can be used as a typical example for depiction.</p>
<p>The author discusses two more sections in even greater detail. Due to space constraints, we are unable to cite them. However, after reading the above section, we can already understand how nationalist literary creation should depict, especially the portrayal of character viewpoints. At the same time, the author also discusses the topics that should be adopted for this creation.</p>
<p>Liu Yuanzhao's "Flowing Water" is a poem containing symbolic power, full of the central consciousness of the nation. It can also be said to have achieved considerable success in art. Every sentence and every word has the perseverance to urge us to strive upwards.</p>
<p>The tenacious and unyielding flowing water</p>
<p>Treacherously running forward</p>
<p>Murmuring and gurgling</p>
<p>Wishing to reach the end of a journey</p>
<p>The resolute and unshakeable flowing water</p>
<p>Striving arduously</p>
<p>Roaring and thundering</p>
<p>Not caring to listen to the triumphant song</p>
<p>Huang Huanruo's "A Heroic Toast" is a powerful work of nationalist literature. We will add a critique after it has been completely published. Wu Xiling's "Random Notes of a Female Poet" is a poetic diary-style essay that also expresses the theory of nationalist literature. This type of writing makes us feel immensely light and cheerful. Cai Cai's "Evening Rain Song" is even more beautifully and powerfully written.</p>
