<h3>美國之救急委員會</h3>
<p>美國銀行家與商家。組織一救急委員會。力主開募興業借欵美金一千兆元。以救濟目下之經濟困難。擬請國會核準用以建築房屋。修造道路。開濬河渠等一切工程。歸中央政府監督進行。是說也。余以爲今日各國救濟經濟困難中暫時救急之第一善法也。蓋欲根本救濟今日世界之經濟困難。非由改變工業中之機器方法與工廠組織。及商業組織。不能有效。若僅欲救濟暫時間之經濟。勿使更陷於困難。則此用人工於不能轉移於市塲之貨物。使失業者有事業之可以工作。而工作之結果。不致使市塲上之貨物益多。商業益落。世界之經濟。益見困難故曰此在暫時救濟經濟困難之第一看法也</p>
<p>中國今日之欲求建設。其振興之事業。除人所必需用之工業貨物。之求自製外其餘一切之人工。亦可用之於美國救急委員會所擬之三條。建築房屋。修造道路。開濬河渠。不但國内天然養生之物產。可以增加而流通。亦不至他日因工業競爭過甚。貨物過多。而致有工商業各國今日之大患。此則於提倡振興百業之時。不可不早爲之注意者也。古人有言。般監之遠。在夏后之世。我於今日中國之建設亦云。</p>

<p>宇垣之進退堪注目</p>
<p>電通社一日東京電犬養政友總裁由各地遊說歸途中批、評現閣無能、氣熖不可一世、其言曰、地方之不景氣、至爲可驚、親往視察現狀、乃愈驚其深刻、但閣員輩果眞知地方實狀乎、政友會刻正準備對付議會策、將於其間提出不信任案、無論如何絶對多數、政策夫敗、仍難掩蔽、非募債主義、亦已露出馬脚、即非募債、實即祇係擁護公債市價、保護金融資本家而已、中產階級以下、全未受惠、軍備之經濟化、乃我三十年來所主張、欲使實現、祇須與軍部促膝相商、即可成功、濱口首相不能列席議會、擬設臨時代理、在法律上固無差異、惟若欲以臨時代理聊以塞責、將難免政治上責任、後任總裁刻正逐鹿、民政黨亦將從此多事云云、</p>
<p>電通社電　政友會决於本屆議會、與政府以致命的一大打擊、甚至進行倒閣、其攻擊主力、則集中於財政問題、提出來價對策問題·减稅問題·失業救濟問題等錯誤之經濟政策、辯士總動員、藉辯論戰之力、俟政府内容紊亂、即提出不信任案、策戰本部除十一名之本部總務及幹事長外、加五六名院内總務、院内首席總務以久原·床次·望月·三士·四人爲有力候補者、院内總務將從内田安藤·堀切·田邊·大口·諸人銓衡之、由二十日開會之政友議員總會發表</p>
<p>電通社一日東京電本屆議會開會期近、政府與黨及政友會均極力研究對策、而政府與黨方面所最憂慮者、厥爲濱口首相之病勢、表面雖稱經過良好、佯作樂觀、其實問題在首相是否能出席於議會再開後之議會、若首相屆時不能出席、於對議會策及今後政局、有重大關係、故與黨方面不能不事前考慮對策、現幹部正在研究、即首相萬一不能出席時、若由臨時首相代理應付、則有違立憲政治本旨之嫌、且幣原臨時總理本人、亦希望於議會再開時解職、即從事實上觀之、當此政局多端之秋、若以臨時總理應付一切、於政府與與黨之聯絡上、極易發生障碍、循此以往、政府必逢重大之難關、關於此點、首相本人於决定將來之方針上、不能不加以愼重之考慮、但與黨内部有安達江木兩派之對立、又有擁立山本·若槻·宇垣·等之傾向、若此等内部間之感情惡化、則關於政府通命、有化爲重大問題之虞、故政府與黨之幹部方面、深恐内部崩潰、戒備甚力</p>

<p>近得讀我師胡石予先生傷悼詩四首。驚悉師母曹夫人仙逝之信。其第四詩。述遺金建橋事。旣馳書慰唁我師。并問及建橋之舉。旋得復書。知師母曹夫人有遺貲千餘金。諸世兄皆不願分取。讓與女弟。女弟亦不願獨有。因謂昔聞母言。鎭北鶴頸灣橋。斷已多年。鄉人出入繞道。至感不便。嘗欲集貲重建。今即以此遺金獨力建築此橋。用成母志。不亦可乎。於是我師與諸世兄咸贊成此舉。聞已呈報區公所。定於明春建築。是可見我師石予先生與師母曹夫人之家庭敎育矣。先生傷悼詩第四首錄於下。曩我嘗問君。何爲太自苦。勤劬過僕婢。羸儉逾難窶。君云哀羣生。誰能盡驅煦。於已苟自克。於人可小補。今檢身後遺。薄財略有貯。女子念母深。不忍私携取。廢橋重建築。昔曾聞君語。適用此遺金。永濟以爲主。湯湯鶴頸灣。欲渡臨流阻。橋斷三十年。今日當興舉。督行倩鄉區。陳報達縣府。用以成君志。匪博名千古。</p>
<h3>蕭女士行</h3>
<p>— 施叔範</p>
<p>宜興蕭女士。豪邁絶巾幗。只身航萬里。矢志爲敎育。含笑别里門。慷慨離滬瀆。天風吹鬚髮。波濤萬頃綠。方謂御仙去。臨流恣遙矚。惟念寸陰艱。開箱裁錦幅。密室理針線。所以愼吾獨。如何滄海裏。豺虎起耽逐。綏綏狐爲厲。咄咄人化畜。炎炎猛獸威。烈烈女士血。皇皇海若驚。悽悽神鬼蹙。殺那幻千險。艱難保璞玉。一獸跟蹌去。一獸重奔扑。無何銜尾至。逡巡凡三復。礪齒而磨牙。大嚼思果腹。無乃避有方。終莫逞厥慾。須知拒之堅。阨迫亦愈促。圖窮逞一聲。顚狂過狂狢。誠哉丈席地。譬彼秘魔窟。長號絶應響。同舟方鼠伏。嗟此弱女子。宛轉俎上肉。雖有殺賊心。防身無利鏃。人獸判一息。可死詎可辱。牀頭斷腸藥。何妨慷慨服。自殺勝殺賊。賊胆亦爲落。壯哉女士心。堅貞爲華族。一絲埀不絶。所賴正氣續。洒雪在吾曹。血書供傳讀。一讀肝腸裂。再讀毛髮　。移書去詰責。彼或知理曲。痛哭今世界。是非在强弱。不爲女士哀。反誣狂　數。更有喪心人。視之竟似熟。蠅營而狗苟。方各樂其樂。寥寥數行電。孤跫響空谷。交涉非正式。赤手那可搏。萬里罔雨笑。東華民氣索。如此舉國羞。處之竟漠漠。問誰無妻女。身受將奚若。同是國内人。胡爲分畛域。驚沙隨風散。奇恥恐未足。百兆女同胞。大可供踐蹴。他時恣淫嬲。何待今日卜。念此慘無言。血涙森噴薄。休爲女士哀。且爲中華哭。</p>
<h3>第一張留聲機片</h3>
<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>美國愛迭生所製的第一隻留聲機器。最近已借給了英國的南卡雪東城之科學博物院中。公開陳列。任人參觀了。該機計重一百五六十磅。僅有唱片一張。其組織这複雜。和式樣之粗笨。殊屬可笑。然而在那時候。愛迭生不知費了多少光陰經過了多少次的失敗。方得製成。亦是難得的事。那張世界第一的唱片。僅有兩句英文歌曲。現在就把它譯了下來。曲云。（曼麗有一條小小的綿羊。柔軟的毛澤的得像白雪一樣。）又當此張唱片開唱時。在塲聽者。除愛迭生自已外。尙有一位英國人呌亨利亞特莫。現聞此機連同唱片。均已贈與此君。以留永久的紀念了。</p>
<h3>西宮參觀記</h3>
<p>— 方子峰</p>
<p>大夏大學之女生宿舍所謂西宮者。余耳其名久矣。然平時苦於宮牆萬仭。禁衛森嚴。不得其門而入。昨日余因事至該校。適逢西宮開放任人參觀之日。金吾不禁。機會難遇。遂請該校敎授馬公愚先生引導。遍游全宮。欣喜之餘。爰述一二。以誌眼福。</p>
<p>西宮名（羣英齋）。爲大夏校舍之最南者。似當南宮。惟就全滬言之。則位置正西耳。宮前有小河。彷佛御溝。板橋通之。古木扶疏。風景幽絶。宮係三層西式建築。式樣新頴。設備完美。爲海上各校女生宿舍之冠。北向爲正門。門畔有誌石。紀建造年月及造者姓氏。馬公愚先生手書也。入門。居中爲客堂。帘幔低埀。佈置雅麗。左右各爲寢室。室率置二榻二几二凳。皆鐵製。室隅有小閣。可置篋笥衣履之屬。故室内不見雜物。整潔異常。而臥榻之位置。几案之陳列。窗壁之將飾。靡有同者。於是各宮主之情性。亦可以略窺一斑矣。有自製玲瓏。之紙帘飾窗。自繪工巧之畫圖飾壁者。則知其人必富於美術性。有室中古籍縱横者。則知其人必好研究國學。有壁間滿懸裸體片者。則知其必爲曲綫美之欣賞家。有以脂粉香露之屬。羅列几案者。則知其必爲化裝大家。有供瓜子果品敬客者。則知其交際術之高明。亦有室中不假絲毫裝飾。案上除應用書藉外。不陳他物者。則必爲樸素之人。獨有一室。則合歡枕、鴛鴦被、銀瓶鈿盒、錦繡幔帳。舉凡新婚洞房中所有物。靡不畢具。其爲新嫁娘無疑。宮中有此。誠特色也。惜是日宮主多避客他去。室邇人遐。未得一一親承顏色。不無遺憾耳名室之裝飾。以在三層樓者爲最精美。是否爲年級較高者所居。殊未知也。游覽旣畢。將出宮門。忽有宮主。趨而過庭。面色倉皇。告其同伴曰。照片三張。不翼而飛矣。吾人聞之。亦爲之不懌。聞是日游者品類不一。頗有潛取壁間倩影及案上化裝品香帕之屬以去者。殊爲太殺風景耳。</p>
<h3>河套中之牛皮筏</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>由甘肅回南之路。一入陜西經潼關。山嶺重疊。荊棘遍途。而計程則較緩。一自寗夏取道五原。行河套中。可以順流而下。然道路不靖。行旅亦感痛苦。西北交通不便。殊亟待發展。也余友陸君。前自甘肅歸來。席間相値。爲余方斯行之險。而所述河套中之牛皮筏。更値得一記。因特爲讀者道之。</p>
<p>自寗夏至五原之道。水程須經河套。黄河之水。冲激甚烈。而沿岸掩沙積石。嶒崚可畏。普通舟楫。一遇觸礁。無可復駛。故商人貨運。槪用木筏。筏絶巨。上可支帳幕多處。並將全牛數頭。空其中。取其皮。實以靱草。紮縛排下故有牛皮筏之稱。牛皮質堅。入水則外表光滑。且不易損。隨水下流。即遇沙石多阻。亦能滑溜。免致擱淺。此種利用牛皮之水運方法。恐祇河套中所特有。他處甚鮮見也。陸君行時。適交冬令。聞沿岸多匪。因請保安隊數人同行。又慮白天易引人注目。常昏夜開駛。黑暗中閉幕而睡。時聞岸上槍聲。或高呼欲施檢查。榜人囑戒勿言。幸轉瞬間。牛皮筏已隨波遠逝。得脫於險。迨至五原。心始釋然云。</p>
<h3>南洋游記（八八）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>余二人方　談鳥性。忽然砰閧一聲。乃獅子吼也。聲震悚。人有若山鳴谷應之勢齊作。狼嘷狐鳴。犬吠猿啼。余意大致其爲聞獅吼而恐怖慘之聲也佛每言獅子吼。今乃領敎矣獅子一吼百獸震恐惟虎在獅旁不鳴亦不動。獅子眞爲獸之王也。但獅平常態度極靜。過于虎由獸羣觀之。獸性出于鳥性。而自命爲人者。乃萬類之仇敵。又萬惡之王。逾于獸也。性善云乎哉。</p>
<p>一印度人驅象曳車而過。余於生平所第一次見也。聞象最多之地。在錫蘭島。數千成羣。云此物在世上陸地爲最大動物。可稱象皇帝也。</p>
<p>七月三日。訪緬甸律師Saw　Hea　Pru蘇罕樸魯。蘇曾云開世界佛敎會於緬。蘇介紹數緬律師。但鄭律師源福云。凡律師皆只知現在。罕研哲學者。創造力少也。據人言緬甸僧人智識乃在居中之上。能英語之僧亦常有之。將來緬人進步仍賴僧人耳。各鄉學校敎育權。仍在僧人手。</p>
<p>四日同道法師往曾光翁處看大藏經。地在豹兔車站。汽車行可二十分。所藏有日本條文雄編定之英文大藏書目。功亦不小。又見日本人凡研究一事。均有科學方法也。中國至今。佛敎内無所貢獻於國内社會。外無貢獻於世界。因學佛者多死守舊派之徒。而通西學者少也。聞傳播佛敎於美國。日本之功不小。至仰光雖緬甸佛敎區。而華人信佛者不多。有之。亦罕深研究。尙不知新嘉坡尙有寺廟及佛敎會。檳城有研究院。而仰光井寺廟亦算無有。佛敎會前似有之。雖高萬邦居其名高死竟無形消滅曾氏有大藏經各任人去看。上午下午均可看云。余在南洋各地時。見有小册英文佛經。仰光并有歐人之佛敎青年會。日本人亦與會。惟無中人與緬人。可怪也。中人凡事不求深造。何哉。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（三二六）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十六回　殷勤問字翠袖謁先生　慷慨談兵青樓宴女傑</p>
<p>林蕃滋道。發胖的原因。固然有種種。少運動確是一個最大原因。此外於食物上。也很有大關係。譬如多喫肉類多喫糖食也是致肥之原像凌趾兄的發胖。只怕還是多吸唕酒之故。據觀啤酒那樣東西。多喝了令人發肥。尤其是那個肚皮會大起來。德國製造的唕酒不是最有名的嗎。所以你們瞧德國人中。大胖子很多。也有許多是凸着大肚皮的。凌趾兄常和德國人交際。喝了那種唕酒。再加以少運動。少走路。自然胖起來了。凌趾祥道。誰也不能說誰。這大塊頭都是漸漸兒成功的。普通的人。都是過了四十歲以後。慢慢的胖起來。也有過民三十歲以後便胖起來的。像我樣三十歲的人。未免胖得太早一點。只怕有點兒不相宜吧。我看詩晨兄將來也要變成一個大塊頭。左詩晨道··奇了。以在地這許多人而論。恰巧我是個最瘦的。浩然兄雖然生得矮。但他是一個小型大塊頭。怎麽在許多人中。單提出我是一個未來的大塊頭呢。凌趾祥道。這裏頭有一個講究。第一。你雖然現在身體是很瘦。但是你的面盤子却很不瘦。而且兩頣間還很見豐滿之狀。這是爲預備將來發胖的一個見本。第二。你是個操筆墨生涯的人說我們少運動。我們到底還是跑來跑去。一息不肯停的人。你是個坐擁書城。可以算得是少運動中尤其少運動的一派。不是你們說少運動是致肥之原　。第三。照你的性情。也將來要胖起來的。左詩晨道。這個我不相信了。性情與胖。有什麽關係。凌趾祥道。什麽没有關係。却有大關係咧。有許多人。一天到晚。愁眉不展。論他的境地。也用不着那樣發愁。但他好像上心事一般。那種人只會瘦下去。我記得古人有句話。呌做心廣體胖。我看你心地和平。什麽事都坦然。從不見你發過胖氣。也不聽得你響過喉龍。聽憑有什麽憂急的事。你還是那個樣子。可見得你什麽事都看得開。也不肯給人家爭天奪地。這就呌做心廣。心廣自然體胖了。林蕃滋道。你的話倒說得不差。詩晨的不愁不急的態度。也被你道着了。只是他將來到底發胖不發胖。現在我們誰也不知道。須待二十年後。方見分曉。我們倒是眼前吃飯問題要緊。不要討論將來的肚子大不大。現在的肚子却先要餓起來了。</p>

<h3>英印棉市疲軟如故</h3>
<p>孟買上週市况黯淡、價格跌小、出口商雖有抵額、惟因新棉到貨之壓迫、恐仍將繼續跌小、現貨方面、眞實需要甚少、日商在上印度購買平果爾歐洲出口南亦講平果爾與奔傑棉、中國頗有問訊奥姆辣者、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<p>利物浦　上週現需靜寂、春期貨市場、仍無生色、賣出方面、額子不多、然均爲逢跌購進者所吸收、本地帮及孟買帮略有購買、埃及棉因大陸商抛賣及亞歷山大消息不利、較形疲軟、</p>
<h3>糧食米市南定北跌</h3>
<p>閘北　昨日裡路到二三十號、走銷不一、白粳高貨仍定、而普通以下悉跌兩角、作坊店胃消化極滞頂因存到兩徵、得守原盤、仍開十四元四五角、但大勢不免績軟也、薄稻到殷去呆河存日厚、價小三角左右、頂開十二元關口、形勢頗疲、羊秈貨稀銷平、杜尖零拆極活、高開十二元九角、埠尖市銷尙可、客尖來源不旺、貨主並不急售、故以上各秈行情、悉無上落、脚地殊穏也、變陰元走銷大淡、賣氣轉盛價、短兩三角、特頂變元開十四元七角、</p>
<p>滬南　昨日河下到船不多、去路不爽常錫北粳到銷兩淡、高開十四元零、蘇同各粳零銷欠暢、裡路產訊報疲、人心不佳、惟　客意存扳售、略有修削、高貨尚無升降、南帮等稻早稻來源稍淡、刻下高貨大盤祗開十一元六七角因買主寥寥、交易沉悶耳、羊秈·杜秈此間去化尙可、但到頭不減趨勢带靜、價格無甚榮辱、夑元微跌陰元隨疲、各檔進意不爽、情况將跟閘市而下落、况高變勉開十四元七角</p>
<h3>客秈市况看緊</h3>
<p>昨客秈市况、本街胃口甚香、似有逐漸步佳之象因天氣寒冷後、產地小酒港將有冰涷之虞、販户亦以天寒無勁、更因政府限定靳歷年底結賬、錢商爲結束起見、各路販户均不克週轉故此後不論杜客秈均有减到之慮、市上人心無不望好本　因杜米到少、尤注意於客秈、此後各客秈到源一减市價立見上漲也、統市售開江西機早六百包、價十元○二角、又機晚二百包價十一元半湖南機米二百包、價十元○六角半、南京機米七百五十包、價十元一角半至十元、又柳糙二百包、價九元一角、又糙米三百包價八元八角、盡係本街辦去、客帮進胃本淡、且因年底結束提早之故、更不欲辦裝云</p>
<h3>近月粉狂出不休</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、呈近跌遠平之象、近期以停拍期間、洋　連小、標準亦大跌不已、所以開價後、人心即異常萎靡、較之前月份之收價、即無形驟短二分零、蓋瑕境惡劣、死守無益、祗好逐步狂了、以求結束、市况之不振工此爲最大之主因、雖廠家之現粉、如福新阜豐等廠盤、均喊兩二錢半、較標準始終高一錢外、但期現殊途、形勢不同、所以非廠家之期貨縮减、實不能望標準之轉佳也、遠期以形成套頭、賣氣轉寂、市亦平穏、五月份初開爲二兩一錢一分一厘半、與四月份相仿、下午未有做開、結果本月份較前月份末跌三分半、一月份跌三分二厘半、二月份跌二分、三月份小二厘半、四月份未動、五月份無比較云、</p>
<h3>期來浮空進慾濃</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初平繼穏之象、因洋麥無報價、投機心思、少去作用、旋以一部分之漂空、以市面如是狂跌、似須暫時站定、故進意較濃、至一般以國外爲目標者、先須有現貨之訂成、方敢再作抛賣、市氣之稍轉穏定、亦無非投機之减少也、結果本月份較前週好三分、一月份好四分、二月份好三分、三月份好四分、四月份好二分、五月初開四兩一錢、收價亦好二分、現麥市况、以各廠均鮮進意、又無做開云、</p>

<h3>海味海带號家遷就求交</h3>
<p>海带近日客路去化頗旺、川·漢·湘·贛·以及閩甌諸帮、均有巨額採辦、惟新貨收成、異常豐稔據各產地調查所得、比較上年、計多收萬石以上、故來源湧到、貨棧滿堆、客銷雖健仍有供過於求之勢、售盤下趨、竟無回頭期望、凡有貨較　號家、莫不削價圖脫、目躉批交易、尤肯特别遷就、行方因鑒號盤之鬆動、亦不敢貪進、昨市行盤兜售、根室带價四兩九錢、浜中厚岸川路等四兩七八錢、首長四兩三錢、鬼莊四兩四錢、二番三兩七八錢、</p>
<h3>南北貨木耳市面慘落</h3>
<p>銷路已漸轉動···或有回好希望</p>
<p>木耳近以銷路不振、市價逐步轉跌、查前市什耳曾售百兩上下現一跌再跌已到九十兩之譜同時漢市亦頻之慘落、普通貨降至八十二三兩、時粤帮曾在地頭直接採購、詎現市復有變動、據電訊亟亟焉、有破八十兩關口之勢、然此價划申仍需九十三四兩、此間行售九十兩、亦難合算、各行且削本應　顧客、以迎合銷胃、故大跌之後、或有小回希望、惟上莊大朶副耳漢存不多、現市辦價一百四十八兩依然挺立、未能再鬆云</p>
<h3>絲茶滬廠經二十五包運杭</h3>

<h3>烏尤心影</h3>
<p>— 康林</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>一葉舟輕、雙漿鴻驚、水天清、影湛溪平、魚翻藻鑑、鷺烟汀、過沙溪急、江山冷、月溪明、</p>
<p>—東坡蝶戀花之一</p>
<p>在長征的旅程中憑着船舷曼誦着這詞句、眼前的、青山綠水使人深深的陶醉、都市塵囂中震撼的心由此得了休息、</p>
<p>爲着來此、把過往的苦樂向後掩埋、描產壯懷的麗句、古人已闡發殆盡了、雖然山川的勝景、使我心煩技癢、然而文字有何技巧呢、</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>我不能用文字來描寫山川形勝、言語更是卑劣的方法了、在心中孕育着一切出壳的思想、願世界有一日到來、、</p>
<p>凡曾倚着船舷凝望、古今文人所歌頌的嘉州山水、點點的從雲衣和波心中浮映、（一葉舟輕、雙槳鴻驚、水天清、）我們千古曠達的詩人已把眼前的美景在筆底浮現了、在今朝的登臨中、我何以描述嘉州山水給於的靈感呢、我是平庸的俗人、只在心中孕育着一切含苞和花朶、</p>
<p>嘉州山水是蜀中山水中之最新秀而蕴着詩意的啓發、假如濟滋所謂世界底詩是伴宇宙而綿永、那這裏是（世界詩）底淵藪、</p>
<p>早把一生的行徑去向流浪接引、正要從人生轉側中領略到人生平凡生活中不可採尋的美夢、因此在南北幾次的浪游中都用心地想從自然的萬彚中獲得什麽、不過流落者的心湖是難於寗靜的海潮、所感受的每每出人意料之外、因而目前難得的希世的美景反不能引起感興、於今我到了嘉州山水的懷抱、太白、少陵、漁洋、諸大家歌誦的勝地能在我心中燃起什麽呢、</p>
<p>在錦江兩月的居停中爲煩悉所苦、所謂枇杷門巷、杜陵故居、十二長橋、丞相祠堂、浣花溪畔、都不曾登臨、而今北國的一切風物都向後掩埋、從黑海中何時再能撈起舊時勝蹟、從這春光明媚的山水中能重新給我心中斟上什麽……</p>
<p>想從這裏的風光明媚中獲得被棄者的靈糧、所以曳着長途的深疲去賞玩青山綠水、固然是戰慄的心旂不能飛揚到自然的懷抱、假如從斷岩的砂礫亙石中尋得了一星金粒、流落者也不至如何的傷懷了、</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>爲着要從砂礫亙石中尋覓金粒、把疲憊的身心付與在長流中久經剝擊的小舟、小舟順着急流駛去、峨嵋山畔歸來的江水在洶洶的碧浪裏發出狂熱的歡笑、　小舟也在潮頭、一起一伏的迎着朝聖歸來的遊山者、在兩兩的迎送中、身心中充盈的疲乏、煩愁、都莫名地湮逝了、</p>
<p>從舟中放眼去遠跳下游的勝蹟、那大佛寺烏尤寺及其他的一個孤立在水涯的山宛如三個女神在江岸眺望、隠隠約約的好似海波裏迷迷的蓬萊三島、遠望只如一片蒼鬱的畫圖、比别處的青山更秘藴着詩意、古人所謂的（詩中有畫）和（畫中有詩、）或許這三座山値得如此的稱譽罷、</p>
<p>大佛實在是偉大的神像、他的全身是由僧人將山的形式刻成的、全身聽說有三四十丈長、頭與山頂齊平、雙足離江水尙遠、常人深恐大佛洗脚、那樣嘉州全城都要淪爲水國了、在六月雅河及青衣江的水漲發時、水的急流向着大佛岩直冲、許多船隻都困觸岩石而成紛碎、那時舟子及乘客都虔心的祈禱大佛救命、並且允許與他裝金、其實就去把那佛的頭部敷飾成一個三四丈的金晃晃的頭陀也不容易、然而人的欺妄、神的虚誕、都長長的綿延着、我的身軀而今臨到了大佛的身前、我只默默的痴望着那岩石刻成的神像、假如有什麽災禍臨到、我或許也免不掉來作一次無聊的禮敬和斯欺妄、而今我能從他啓發着什麽、只不過覺得這是一尊愚盲宿命依託的佛像罷了、</p>
<p>小舟沿着岩石向下游推駛、行過了一带斷岸、烏尤寺的山巓就在眼前浮現了、火光中閃爍般的紅岩在夕陽的金光中更顯得殷紅、蔓藤繞着、樹枝參差的倒掛在山心、蒼綠的森林更挿入雲表般的高聳着、我和同學們在舟中遙望着、覺得（烏尤的勝景）盡於斯矣、實在的、以後攀登了若干級的石階而進入寺門後、只一切的勝景爲偶像獨佔罷了、所謂（不識廬山眞面目、此身原在此山中）之句可以借來描述我們這次登臨的情愫、在江上所感受的靈氣、在山中眞完全澌滅了、</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>爲着萬里長征、想在回憶中吮嘗家山的風味、更要的是想從三蘇的故鄉及東坡息遊的所在探訪勝蹟、然而一切都令人失望、在這社會有何値得長有、雖然這烏尤寺、東坡樓、大佛寺、在文物上有絶世不能磨滅的價値、然而我們從此中獲得了什麽呢…………</p>
<p>在客次的煩忙中無力去探討一切的傳說、據老僧的告語中、微記得（烏尤）是護心的靈物、餘外的神話都莫名忘懷了、好得蜀中聞名的詩人趙熙在烏尤寺門前的石碑上寫有(離　）兩字、下面更跋有（班志、鑿離嶣以避沬水、知沬水則知離嶣也、穿工江成都中蓋又一事也、輥之斯誤、）或說這山在歷史上尙有些地位、</p>
<p>據山僧的壯語、這兩山在嘉州水中要佔第一位、後來因兵匪的蹂躏、一切的勝景都變爲廢墟了、最近雖想培植、又屢爲着内戰的紛攘作罷、所以我詢問有無勝景的記載時、他不禁爲之愕然了、</p>
<h3>黑裙</h3>
<p>— 冰攝</p>
<p>烏尤寺有僧侶三十餘人、大佛寺大約不相上下、那朝夕誦經的寄生者、在名山的隠居生活中靠着廟產佈施齋懺較世上的庸俗很安閑的過活、爲着生已今朝的落、念着山僧的閑逸、爲着浪跡無憑、覺得這吃人的社會中尙容着這畸形的人向下生存、人生是這般的矛盾、我總覺得人世上永遠都逃不脫這矛盾的範疇、</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>在某寺的門首寫着東坡名句（大江東去）、我於今能向着天涯歌唱麽、固然想（唱得千山響、自家拍掌、）然而在生活的鞭策中、持别是閒情逸趣與流浪者無緣、而且喉頭已爲着人世的刀鋸愛裂、即使這裏的山河能給我以偉大的世界之詩和音樂、我能重振斷絃去彈弄麽、</p>
<p>一切都從眼前破滅、讓這世界黑暗之去、讓惡流的偉力泛濫全世界、一切的所謂眞美善愛……乃至一切藴蓄的眞理狂言都現實的黑暗中毁滅、我們期待着、讓這一切被咒詛的事物在某時代的到來時重新去建築地壁壘和基礎、</p>
<p>夕陽的金光從天陰返映在殷紅岩石下的深潭裏、每個漣漪的核心中都充着光燦、這正象徵着現代熱烈而熊熊的火熖在舊時代的面上燃燒、廻光的返照不久間就要在某世代的黎明期湮滅、所以我耐心去伴飄蕩的心旗、她的内裏是滿着現今憧憬的光明、她的行程是向着未來接引、或許正如俄國詩人Nadson一樣、覺得自已是奴隸而不是預言家、而且相信總有一天、惡神華並兒終要淪滅、</p>
<p>這嘉州山水正如詩人東坡在赤壁的懷古、（大江東去、浪淘盡千古風流人物）在亂石崩雲和驚濤裂岸裏、如畫的江山、銷滅了多少英雄、而今我也并非在心中燃着懷古的情調、不過在無限生中的相遇裏使人覺得些姜凄苦、然而我不傷懷、假如父親的犧牲曾經給予我流落的動力、我願從人世喝乾這滿着血滴的一杯、</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>朋友、别了、一切的蜀山蜀水呵、别了、呵、一切的一切别了、</p>
<p>奮鬥即是生活、奮鬥即是力願、先烈的遺型鞭策着我灰色而趨腐的屍身、在黑暗的長道中讓我詛咒現實的滅亡、憧憬着未來的榮光、</p>
<p>朋友呵、别了、過去的一切潮頭掩埋、讓新的世界在大時代的臺上跳舞、灰色馬在潮頭呼號、别了、一切的一切、我跨上了馬的鞍韉、</p>
<p>一切的家山呵、一切的萬彚呵、别了</p>

<h3>時代青年社成立</h3>
<p>時代青年社自於十一月二十三日假座天后宮樹基小學舉行成立大會、上海青年界空氣頓爲之一振、該社於昨日發表宣方如次、</p>
<p>時代的輪軸、不斷地勇向前進、我們要是不做時代的落伍者、那裏容許我們姑息苟安、我們祗有跟着我們的時代向前跑、可是在這一個思想複雜的世界、往往有因爲走錯了路、不但做了時代的罪人、並且貽誤了自已的終身、因此我們一面固然要向前進行、一面還須要愼重地選擇我們所應走的路、在五四運動的時候、當時需要一切外來的思想、東奔西撞來摧毁陳腐不堪的舊思想、那時各個青年、實在無暇去選擇那一條是最適當的路、祇要可以打破中國落伍的思想、一切都搬運到中國來、現在中國客觀的環境、不同往昔、目前所需要的是如何救中國於埀危之局、這幾年革命的經過、使我們不無多少的失望、革命民衆的呼號、往往會受意外的摧殘、多少年年、因烦悶而轉入所謂反動之路的、同時共產黨徒國家主義派等等乃應運而起、造成五四以後整個青年界分崩離折的局面、我們萬分痛心的是青年與青年間自相殘殺、我們明白這個惡運的來臨、我們要想挽救這一個危機、我們深信、惟一的途徑、只有我們青年自已起來努力、我們明白過去青年間裂痕最大的關鍵、就是建樹不起一個中心的思想、這個關鍵、不但我們的同志間、要十分地了解、同時傍徨於十字街頭的青年們、也須有平心靜氣的考量、我們知道五四運動的肇端、爲救國運動、但是怎樣去救中國、我們以爲最需要的、是喚起全國國民、尤其是青年、有民族意識普遍的感覺、我們應該認清一切危害我們民族者是我們的敵人、其次、我們要明暸肩負這個重大責任的、便輪到我們青年的身上、我們要打緊我們的精神、訓練我們的知能、完成我們責無旁貸的使命、我們誓向我們所認清的光明大道前進、我們知道現在我們微弱的基礎、對我們的期望不能有相當的保障、但我們相信表同情於我們的青年、不在少數、同時又確信、這最後的勝利、能在我們努力的企求之下而實現、現在我們先從這一個繁雜的社會（上海）做起、我們是十二萬分期望上海的青年同志們、予我們以極大的帮助、謹此宣言、</p>

<h3>汛汛社</h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>青年文藝團體</p>
<p>這是一個好的消息</p>
<p>海上各大學校裏、是有不少的青年作家、當然、他們大都在國内文壇上取得相當的聲譽、有比較優良的作品貢獻於世、不過他們所以今日所謂青年作家的地位完全依靠自已作品的力量在國内各個大小刋物上投稿來的、這却很費了許多艱辛、掙扎着、而且、海上的出版界是多麽黑黯、廣收青年作家一般來稿的、或許祗有異軍突起的中心刋物、（時代青年）吧、這刋物所以受了多數學生的懽迎、也是爲了這個綠故、</p>
<p>這些各大學裏的青年作家、大都是散沙似的没有一種鞏固的組織、在平時、更是很少感情的聯絡、各走各的路的、所以、在思想方面是含有絶大的危險性、易於趨向歧途、有時、還要互相排斥與嫉妒、這當然不是一種好的現象、旣然大家同走文藝之道、就應該有所合作、以求（他山攻錯）之益、在所收效果上、也比較來得廣大、因爲這樣、這般研究文藝素有心得的青年作家、便於最近期間之内組織了一個廣義的文藝團體汛汛社、這裏面的社員、大都是知名者、如中公的王一心、何家槐、持志的李英樵、大夏的陳伯吹、復旦的梁紹文等、王一心與李英樵兩君、在（時代青年（上已發表過許多作品、對於民族主義文藝運動、素表熱烈的同情、他倆合著的詩集（忘憂草、）不久即由聯合書店出版、其中以民族主義爲詩的中心思想的、亦復不少、這汛汛社的組織、已成立有時、爲增進文藝的旨趣、發展個人的天才起見、已决定出版文藝刋物一種、命名爲（汛汛月刋）</p>
<p>他們的旨趣大都相同、所以這次出版月刋的經費完全由各人自已分担、在寫稿方面、亦各愼重其事、以期成爲國内純文藝刋物中後起的一朶奇花、我們知道、青年們的毅力是很可畏的、祇要能夠振起精神的努力、未來的成就一定有所可觀、並且、爲求這月刋的内容充實起、見據說除以上諸君自已担任稿件之外、特請國内著名作家撰稿、如趙景深、郡冠華、沈從文、聞一多等、預料該月刋出版之後、定有許多力作貢獻於世、同時、亦爲反普羅文學的重要刋物、</p>

<h3>竊案</h3>
<p>— 慕貞</p>
<p>我校是滬上一個貴族女子中學校、到這裏來求學的一般小姐們、至少她們的家庭有小康的資格、所以每天上下學乘坐包車汽車來往的很多很多、</p>
<p>一天的傍晚、訓育處有、一個學生愁眉苦臉對着一位和謁可親的訓育主任說、一先生、我的嚴閉在箱中的兩只白金手錶不見了、連箱上的鎖也拆毁了、）訓育主任很驚駭的說、（又出竊案了嗎、咄咄、誰又來幹這無恥事了、你這事的損失有多大、）學生說（兩只錶其値百八十金、因需修理、所以藏在箱裏不用、今天開箱取衣、那知鎖已壞了、錶則不翼而飛了、主任先生急安慰她說、（不用急、我給你查）</p>
<p>於是開始去偵查了、同房間的當然盡在嫌疑地位、她們不待主任說要加她們以檢查、却早已自動地要求檢查、以示無他了、檢查之下、毫無所有、後來主任先生忽億及某天的晚上、有某小姐曾在人家統在自修時她獨登樸取物、並說即爲這失物者所託的、乃急召失物者至、詢問她某某夜曾否托某小姐登樓取物、失物者沉思有頃、答曰無、於是某小姐大有嫌疑了、急喚之來、問她（曾見那人之兩手錶否、）她立說、我和她不是住在一間房裏那裏知道、先生疑我、則請登樓去檢我行裝可也、）主任意也不客氣、相偕極</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>去、翻其兩箱、並不見有兩錶、又取其皮夾來看、毫無意議地翻翻她夾中的敗紙、則見有一修理鐘錶的票單單、上載明修手錶三只、這時她的面容不自然了、没有先時的從容鎭靜了、主任見事有眉目、急</p>
<p>喚失主持票鐘錶取出檢視、一見之下、果是她所失的兩錶、回來報告說、是她所失的、打量某小姐由嫌疑而成正犯了、她見證據找到、無可抵頼、便號啕大哭起來</p>
<p>這時的主任先生竟也顧不得許多了、立刻以電話邀她的保證人來、星夜带了她出校、給她一個開除處分、</p>
<p>不過大家所不明白的、就是某小姐家庭富有、父爲銀行重要職員、她個人的衣服麗都、手指上且有亮晶晶的鑽戒、皮夾中在離校時還有花花缘缘的三百多元鈔票、這樣的富足、竟會竊此兩錶、眞是百思不得其解、</p>
<p>烈日行天、緣蔭遍地、姊妹們都要放暑假歸去了、在放假的一天、寄宿舍裏大家忙着整理行裝、個個人的臉上都充滿着愉快的情狀、</p>
<p>有某小姐在開箱納衣時、曾把三張十元的鈔票暫置牀頭、因爲到間壁一同學處去取一本書、回來時三十元已不見來、打呵欠、割舌頭、賊的本領竟這樣大、使得她又惶急、又驚奇、繼思見我置銀者、僅一綽號小貓的某小姐、且我開箱裝物、她坐我牀上看視、我去取書、她猶坐着、回來則已他去、此欵必爲她所私取無疑、　　於是立刻去報告訓育主任、主任說、照代所說、小貓確實可疑、但你有鈔票、她亦有鈔票、即使查到他身上有鈔票、那能就說她是偷你的呢、）某小姐却忻然說、（無巧不成文、前天我父送來這三張鈔票後、我在燈下取出審視、因一心歸去、便無意識地在鈔票上都取自來小筆寫下（歸去矣）三個字、倘使在她身上或箱中查有這三字的十元鈔票、便是她偷的無疑了、）主任見她料得定、且物有暗記、便立刻相偕去檢查、</p>
<p>在走廊裏便撲面撞着小貓、主任說、（某小姐、你身上所有的鈔票給我看一看、）小貓突然見問、倒也不能不肯、心中暗相即使是那偷的一會事、鈔票人人有何、必怕懼、所以便坦然的取出、主任接來一看、一共五張鈔票其、中三張十五元的果有（歸去矣）三字、便冷笑一聲說、（某小姐、你鈔票上有暗號否、）小貓說、（没有）主任說、（那末這三張有歸去矣、三字的不是你而是我的了、且存在我處罷、）說着更扯了她到訓育處、低聲和她說、（此間無人、我正告你、今日放假、你此去不必再來了、你這行爲、我也不向全校宣佈、留你一些面子、你滿意嗎、於是小貓在無可抗抵之下、祇得永别我校、可惜她明年就要高中畢業了、而竟不能、</p>
<p>秋雨蕭蕭之夜、三號寄宿舍中簇擁着許多人、在大談其圓光、</p>
<p>一個說、（圓光事靈騐得很、要把這偷的人如何辦、就可以如何辦、我們這次圓光、據我想來、把這偷的人面上刺一個賊字、使她面上掛了賊的招牌、不敢出見人面、有的說在她面上刺一朶花、有的說盡一個銀圓、有的說刺在面上大難看、還是在她胸前刺個什麽、使她將來做了人家的……</p>
<p>話未說完、大家已笑得前翻後仰了、一陣哄笑止後、一個人很鄭重地說、（人家一時昏茫、偷了東西、竟把她臉上刺字等等、大使人難堪、我們應該原諒她、我想這樣辦、限她在明天上午十二時前、由她把偷去的四十塊錢、暗中送還失主、放在失主容易見到的地方、如果儘明天上午她還不送還、那末她不是一時的昏迷、竟是甘心作賊了、而我們也不必客氣、决請人圓光、給她一個大大的難堪、）大家都說好好、</p>
<p>果然到了明天早上第一課前、失銀者走進敎室上課、台板啓處、珠還合浦了、</p>
<p>大家聽得、都說圓光靈、</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chiang issued seven admonitions to the various bandit suppression units and specially ordered the governments of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces on the 1st to relay them to their subordinates for uniform compliance. The original order reads: "It is noted that the purpose of establishing a military force in a country is to protect the country and defend the people. The primary requirement for us in governing the military is to strictly abide by discipline. Discipline is the new life of the military. A disciplined military not only enhances its own honor but also receives the welcome of the people. Conversely, disturbing the villages and increasing the suffering of the people, and increasing the oppression of the people, what is the purpose of establishing a military force in the country? Since I have governed the military, I have given repeated admonitions to my military subordinates to consistently maintain discipline. Now that the communist bandits are causing trouble and the people are suffering, there is no choice but to carry out a suppression. Now that the subordinates are determined, I will issue several things as admonitions to all generals and soldiers: (1) Do not recruit troops locally without approval; (2) Do not raise funds locally without approval; (3) Except for suppressing the communist bandits, do not interfere in local administrative matters; (4) Do not confiscate civilian militia firearms; (5) Do not recruit bandits; (6) Pay strict attention to soldiers selling bullets to bandits; (7) During the bandit suppression period, military agencies shall not directly appoint personnel related to civil affairs, finance, and party affairs. The above seven items not only affect local security but also relate to the discipline of the military and the reputation of the military. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued to instruct the governments concerned to comply and relay to their subordinates for uniform compliance."

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>America's Relief Committee</h3>
<p>American bankers and businessmen have organized a relief committee, advocating the raising of a \$1 trillion USD industrial loan to alleviate the current economic difficulties. They propose that Congress approve its use for the construction of houses, roads, canals, and other projects, supervised by the central government. I believe that this is currently the best temporary relief method for economic difficulties in various countries. Fundamentally solving today's global economic difficulties requires changing the methods of machinery and factory organization in industry, as well as commercial organization. Merely seeking temporary economic relief to prevent further difficulties, this method employs labor on goods that cannot be transferred to the market, providing jobs for the unemployed, and the result of the work does not lead to more goods on the market, further declining commerce, or increasing the difficulty of the world's economy. Therefore, it is said that this is the primary consideration for temporarily alleviating economic difficulties.</p>
<p>China's current desire for construction and its revitalization efforts, in addition to the necessary industrial goods for people seeking self-sufficiency, can also use all remaining labor in the three items proposed by the American Relief Committee: building houses, constructing roads, and dredging canals. Not only can domestic natural resources and products be increased and circulated, but it will also prevent the major problems faced by today's industrial and commercial countries due to excessive industrial competition and excessive goods in the future. This should be noted early when promoting the revitalization of all industries. As the ancients said, "The vision of Ban and Jian was long ago in the Xia Dynasty." I say the same for China's construction today.</p>

<h3>After the Austrian Cabinet Resigned</h3>
<p>The Self-Defense Corps Did Not Take Action Beyond the Rails</p>
<p>People's Hearts Are Greatly Settled</p>
<p>National News Agency, Vienna, 30th – After the resignation of the Austrian Fugang cabinet, Austrians were uneasy because Prince Steinhaimberg, the interior minister and leader of the Self-Defense Corps, had said that the corps would not easily give up power once it held it. However, there has been no movement so far. It seems that the original plan of the corps has overcome serious resistance, and people's hearts have been greatly settled. Although the corps has similar views as the Italian Fascist Party, the Austrians are dissatisfied with Italy's attitude towards the German and Austrian people in the Tyrol region. Therefore, the corps is unwilling to join hands with the Italian Fascist Party.</p>

<p>Therefore, Mr. Babaster, the initiator of the corps, returned to Austria from Italy, but he still had no development and left in frustration.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ruling and Opposition Parties Prepare Parliamentary Strategies</h3>
<p>President of Seiyukai Criticizes the Current Cabinet's Misgovernment</p>
<p>Whether Hankou Can Attend Is Still in Question</p>
<p>The Advance or Retreat of Ugaki is Noteworthy</p>
<p>Electrical News Agency, Tokyo, 1st – Inukai, President of the Seiyukai, criticized the current cabinet's incompetence on his way back from lobbying in various places, and his anger was overwhelming. He said, "The economic depression in various places is extremely alarming. After personally inspecting the current situation, I am even more surprised by its depth. But do the cabinet members really know the actual situation in the local areas?" The Seiyukai is currently preparing to deal with parliamentary strategies and will propose a vote of no confidence during that time. "No matter how absolute the majority is, the failure of the policy cannot be concealed. The principle of not borrowing money has also been exposed. Even if it is not borrowing money, it is actually just supporting the market price of public bonds and protecting financial capitalists. The middle class and below have not benefited at all. The economization of military equipment is what I have been advocating for 30 years. If you want to achieve it, you only need to talk to the military department frankly and it can be successful." It is said that Prime Minister Hamaguchi cannot attend the parliament and intends to set up a temporary agent. Although there is no difference in law, if he wants to use a temporary agent to deal with it perfunctorily, he will inevitably have political responsibility. The next president is currently vying for the position, and the Minseito Party will also have many things to do from now on.</p>
<p>Electrical News Agency – The Seiyukai decided to give the government a fatal blow in this parliamentary session, and even carry out a cabinet overthrow. The main force of the attack will be concentrated on financial issues, proposing errors in economic policies such as the countermeasure problem, the tax reduction problem, and the unemployment relief problem. All the debaters were mobilized, using the power of debate to wait for the government's content to be chaotic, and then propose a vote of no confidence. The strategy headquarters will add five or six parliamentary affairs officers in addition to the eleven headquarters affairs officers and secretary generals. Kuhara, Tokonami, Mochizuki, and Sanji will be strong candidates for chief parliamentary affairs officers. Parliamentary affairs officers will be selected from Uchida, Ando, ​​Horikiri, Tanabe, Oguchi, and others, and will be announced at the Seiyukai parliamentary general meeting held on the 20th.</p>
<p>Electrical News Agency, Tokyo, 1st – As the opening of this parliamentary session is approaching, the government, the party, and the Seiyukai are all actively studying countermeasures. What the government and the party are most worried about is Prime Minister Hamaguchi's illness. Although the surface claims that it is going well and pretends to be optimistic, the real question is whether the Prime Minister can attend the parliament after the reopening of the parliament. If the Prime Minister cannot attend at that time, it will have a major relationship with the countermeasures against the parliament and the future political situation. Therefore, the party cannot but consider countermeasures in advance. The current executives are studying that if the temporary Prime Minister deals with it in case the Prime Minister cannot attend, it is suspected of violating the essence of constitutional politics, and Temporary Prime Minister Hara himself also hopes to resign when the parliament reopens. In fact, when the political situation is changing, if the temporary Prime Minister deals with everything, it is very easy to cause obstacles to the communication between the government and the party. If this continues, the government will inevitably encounter major difficulties. Regarding this point, the Prime Minister himself cannot but give it careful consideration in deciding the future policy. However, there is a confrontation between the Adachi and Ekime factions within the party, and there is also a tendency to support Yamamoto, Wakatsuki, Ugaki, etc. If the feelings between such internal parties deteriorate, there is a risk that the government's decree will turn into a major problem. Therefore, the government and the party's executives are deeply afraid of internal collapse and are very vigilant.</p>
<p>Electrical News Agency, Tokyo, 1st – Prime Minister Hamaguchi has been doing very well since then. Since the wound dressing was changed on the 28th, he has been in a better mood. Recently, he told his subordinates that he would like to attend the parliament after the recess. The attending doctors are also carefully treating him, and it seems that he will be fully discharged from the hospital by the middle of this month.</p>
<p>Electrical News Agency, Tokyo, 1st – The issue of Prime Minister Hamaguchi's health has led to the issue of the next president. At this time, the advance and retreat of Minister of Army Ugaki is very noteworthy. According to him, Minister of Army Ugaki's People's Administration Cabinet is trying to reform the military administration and because of his trust in Prime Minister Hamaguchi. If Prime Minister Hamaguchi resigns as president and Internal Minister Adachi or Economic Minister Ekime succeeds him, Ugaki and Adachi are usually at odds, and he is also unwilling to give in to Ekime. In the end, he may withdraw from the current cabinet. Minister of Army Ugaki has recovered from his illness, but he has not yet gone to work, and the army's regular changes are also approaching, but he still has not clearly stated the date of his visit to the hall, which is due to this.</p>
<h3>Indian People Salute the National Flag</h3>
<p>Police Use Batons to Drive Away</p>
<p>Sixty-Five People Injured</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 30th – Here, after saluting the national flag, the crowd took demonstrative action. The police drove them away with batons.

<h3>Defendants in Russian Conspiracy Case Deny Torture and Forced Confessions</h3>
<p>Involving Important French Government Figures</p>
<p>French Newspapers Call for Cutting Off Relations with Russia</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 30th – When the industrial sabotage case was being tried today, the prosecutor read the declaration of the Presidium of the Industrial and Commercial Committee of the Paris White Russian Agency, denying that the words involved the committee of the group in the confessions of the defendants. He pointed out that the confessions of Lai Mu Xun and others were forced by torture, but Lai Mu Xun and the eight defendants confessed one after another that they did indeed have illegal dealings with the committee and had a conspiracy to sabotage the Soviet Union. The declaration of the committee was not true. They were not tortured, and there were no traces of injury on their bodies, which could be a clear proof.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th – The influential newspapers in Paris today advocate that the French government should cut off relations with Russia in retaliation for the Russian engineers' false accusation of the French government's conspiracy to armed intervention to overthrow the Soviet Russian regime in the case of eight Russian engineers being accused of conspiracy.</p>
<h3>Speculation About the Resignation of the Polish Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Due to Criticism from Domestic and Foreign Public Opinion</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 30th – The resignation of Polish Prime Minister General Pilsudski has aroused the attention of the whole of Europe. Most people do not believe his claim of illness. In Germany, it is expected that this move is due to the fact that Pilsudski's cronies have repeatedly abused the opposition parties and ethnic minorities during the Polish parliamentary elections, causing criticism from public opinion, causing the Ukrainian Committee to submit a complaint to the League of Nations, and Germany also raised a protest. France also does not support it very much, so he resigns to take the blame. However, whether he will not ask about the political situation in the future, or will still retreat behind the scenes to direct, remains to be proven by the facts.</p>
<h3>The Preparatory Committee for Disarmament is About to End</h3>
<p>The General Assembly Will Be Held Next Spring</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Speaks on Disarmament</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 30th – American Ambassador to Belgium Gibson reported here yesterday that the work of the Disarmament Preparatory Committee is expected to end next week. Acting Secretary of State Cotton said today that the discussions of the Preparatory Committee are proceeding along the expected direction and that no incident has occurred that could prevent the United States from joining the Disarmament Conference. The General Assembly will probably be held in February 1931. Currently, there are several items under discussion that the United States cannot participate in, or must have reservations. Although the Acting Secretary of State did not explicitly state what the United States cannot participate in, it is expected that he is referring to the case of restricting armaments based on the budget.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th – British Foreign Secretary Henderson said in Cardiff yesterday when referring to the matter of disarmament that, according to the arbitration clause currently accepted by the British government, all disputes will be submitted to the arbitration committee. As a result of the discussions at the Imperial Conference, it is now hoped that the overseas autonomous regions will adopt this important new step together with the British government. Since the British Empire has led the way, other countries will definitely follow suit. At that time, all countries will have gone a step further to move towards the completion of the defense line method. As for the world disarmament issue, the British government and the overseas autonomous regions have the same views. The Geneva Disarmament Preparatory Committee has made satisfactory progress, and British representative Cecil has played a powerful role in it. Both human resources and material resources must be limited, and the news must be made public so that we know the actions of the governments, and the League of Nations Committee must have a kind of supervisory power, so that the restrictions contained in the disarmament convention are not exceeded by any country, and the disarmament convention may be amended after five years. If the experience of the first five years clearly proves that the convention needs to be amended, then all countries may improve it. When the work of the Disarmament Preparatory Committee is completed, the Disarmament Conference representing the world can be convened on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>The European Unemployment Problem France Was Finally Caught in the Vortex</h3>
<p>Merchants Plan to Ask the Government to Restrict Immigration – National News Agency, Paris, December 1st – The European unemployment problem has been raging recently. France does not seem to have been caught in the vortex, but in recent days, it has gradually felt its impact. There have been scenes of unemployment in several industrial centers, and the number of Eastern European immigrants who have entered France to seek work has also increased sharply, with a large number of monks but less porridge. Among the immigrants, Poland is the leader, so domestic commercial groups plan to request the government to resist this crazy orchid of immigrants entering the country to prevent the occurrence of difficult labor scenes.</p>

<p>The Authorities Are Quite Vigilant</p>
<p>Electrical News Agency, Tokyo, 1st – The National Mass Party Congress was held at the Shibaxie Harmony Hall at noon today. 600 members from all over the country attended. The authorities are extremely vigilant. Before the meeting, the printing materials of the Congress's proposals were confiscated, causing an uproar. After negotiations, the authorities ordered that (1) the matter of unemployment struggle, (2) the matter of abolishing political discrimination in the colonies, and (3) the matter of organizing labor-peasant self-defense groups be deleted before the printing materials could be retrieved. Therefore, from the beginning of the meeting, the scene was full of murderous aura, and the official suppression was extremely severe, repeatedly ordering the speeches to be stopped. The party leader, Mr. Aso Hisashi, was not subdued by the suppression and started his speech, saying, "Our party is currently advocating the merger of the three proletarian parties. The authorities are deeply afraid of the rapid progress of our party, so they are suppressing us." The audience applauded. Although the meeting was hindered by the authorities, it still proceeded.</p>
<p>Japan Union News Agency, Tokyo, December 1st – The main proposals discussed at the Japan Mass Party Congress today are as follows: (1) This Congress will produce a document promoting the union and elect five representatives to negotiate with the Social Democratic Labor-Peasant Party to review this issue at the Union Congress. (2) Each federation shall make every effort to urge the establishment of a joint promotion committee by each party in order to achieve the goal of establishing a union as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Memorial Week for the Central Government and the National Government</h3>
<p>At 9:00 a.m. on the first day, the Central Party Headquarters held the 87th Memorial Week for the Premier in the Grand Auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters. Central Committee members Sun Ke, Chen Lifu, Ma Chaojun, Chen Yaoyuan, Government Committee member Zhang Xueliang, and staff from various departments and offices, as well as guests, totaling about 500 to 600 people, attended. Sun Ke, the chairman, presided. After the ceremony, the chairman reported, saying that the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session on reforming party affairs may inevitably cause some doubts and fears among the general comrades. What they doubt is the reduction of the organizational scope and the intensification of work. What they fear is that the party affairs funds will not be able to rely solely on the supply of the central and local governments in the future and will not be able to maintain themselves. This view is because they have not fundamentally understood the party's past history and achievements. It must be known that the construction of the party is the construction of the Three People's Principles, which is unanimously supported by the people of the country. Recently, the imperialists have changed their attitude towards China, treating each other with reciprocity and equality. The domestic reactionary warlords have been successively wiped out, and the situation of unification and great harmony is gradually approaching. This is not due to the victory of diplomacy and military affairs, but to the victory of the power of the Three People's Principles. The comrades of this party bear the mission of carrying out the Three People's Principles to build a new China, and their responsibility is very great. The erroneous concept of upholding rights must be thoroughly reformed. The glory of the party's past history is that it carried out secret revolutionary work in the opposition to overthrow the autocracy, defeat the warlords, and eradicate the opposing forces, regardless of all personal interests, relying on the spirit of sacrifice and struggle to achieve the final success of the movement. Now that this party has seized power and is in power, its duty is to assist the government in leading the people to carry out construction work, not to seek to achieve the purpose of revolution by destruction as it did in the opposition. If it cannot cooperate with the government, or even destroys it, it is tantamount to making the party itself lose its tool of operation, and the destruction of the Chinese Communist Party and all its conspiracies is like a machine that is not good, so it can be updated. If the new equipment has not been fully equipped, destroying the old equipment first is equivalent to a suicidal policy. As for the party organs in the local areas, they have the obligation to the party affairs of the headquarters and this region. They should raise funds for the party themselves, and the party members should support the party headquarters. If they compete with the local government for power, and the party members interfere in the administration, following the bad habits of local bullies, the party and the government will become a confrontation, causing the people to be at a loss. Then, the people's belief in the party will gradually weaken, and there will be an impact on the progress of the Three People's Principles. How can it be expected to be universal? The people spend tens of millions of dollars a year to support the party members, and the result is thrown into a false pit. This kind of phenomenon is so dangerous. If this continues, the future of party affairs will be feared. It is hoped that the comrades of this party will understand this purpose, and each will be invigorated, fundamentally eliminating the previous erroneous concepts, and never make mistakes, so as to cast a permanent big mistake. There is no need to doubt or fear the resolutions of this party affair either. What is especially hoped of the comrades is that the new construction is based on science, and everything that is needed is different from the past, so in terms of movement and work, we must strive for innovation from the spiritual aspect, and do not be content with documents and inherent forms. Among the four movements, literacy is the most important. We should each do our best to seek universal education in order to cultivate a large number of new citizens, etc. After the report, the meeting adjourned at 10:00 a.m.</p>
<p>National Government – The National Government held the Premier's Memorial Week at 10:00 a.m. on the same day.</p>

Wang Chonghui, the chairman, presided over the ceremony. Wang Chonghui then took the stage to deliver a speech entitled (The National Conference), saying that the National Conference must be implemented as soon as possible according to the Premier's will. Its purpose is to seek national unification and construction. This is different from the National Congress. The National Congress has different powers in formulating the constitution, promulgating the constitution, etc., and cannot be confused. It is hoped that everyone will work harder so that when the constitutional government period arrives, the power will be returned to the people without shame. The speech is still being organized.</p>
<h3>Petition to the National Government from Representatives of Koubei</h3>
<p>Koubei's ten counties being incorporated into Chahar Province was originally Yan Xishan's private scheme to facilitate military transport in the Ping-Sui area and dominate North China, not to develop the border region. It is reported that representatives of the ten counties, including Wang Shigong, have actively appealed to various parties in Beijing. The day before yesterday (the 29th), they submitted a petition to the National Government. The petition is recorded as follows: (We, representatives of the ten counties in Koubei, have always belonged to Hebei. Administratively, there is a long-standing common history and cooperative habit. In terms of national defense, it is like a room and its screen. In peacetime, it provides the safety of auxiliary wheels; in wartime, it exerts the effect of arms and fingers. Koubei is close to both Mongolia and has long been considered an important town. The key to the northern gate is especially important to Hebei. Without Hebei, Koubei would be isolated outside the pass, with weak strength and difficult support. Without Koubei, Hebei would be withdrawing its defense line, and its teeth would be cold. The division of Xuan Da Zhen in the late Ming Dynasty can be used as a lesson. In the autumn of the 17th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1928], Yan Xishan occupied North China, recklessly making changes, dividing the five western counties of Chahar to Suiyuan, and the ten counties of Hebei to Chahar, jointly establishing a new province. His attention was focused on using Shanxi as the center, consolidating the defense of northern Shanxi, facilitating the military transport of the entire Ping-Sui Railway, advancing to occupy Beiping and Tianjin, controlling North China, and retreating to defend Nankou, like a tiger relying on a dangerous mountain. Therefore, he did not hesitate to make Chahar, Suiyuan, and Hebei lose their inherent regions. It was not a plan that benefited administrative facilities or facilitated the affiliation of the people. We have been running around and appealing, but Yan Xishan insisted on his own way, and Xue Neichang secretly supported him, vaguely requesting the central government to approve it. Now, after two years, there are hundreds of harms and no benefits. The ten counties are barren and the people are poor. The burden is heavier than when they belonged to Hebei, and heavier than the counties currently belonging to Hebei, exceeding several or even dozens of times. For example, this year's special military donation is 4 million for the entire Hebei province, while Koubei is 1 million. On average per county, it is more than twice as much. Most of the original six counties in the Chahar area are newly developed barren areas. It is no different than these ten counties bearing the entire burden. The local area is haggard, comparable to the Shaanxi disaster. This can still be said to be the tyrannical rule of warlords, which should of course be abolished. In peacetime, the military expenditure for 130 counties in Hebei is 960,000 per month. Koubei, combined, is only 16 counties, but it is 200,000 to 300,000. Since there is no hope of receiving assistance, it is better to be within the capacity of the people. Moreover, the educational expenses have no source, and the four surcharges require huge sums of money. Giving it means exhausting all resources; refusing it means suspending education. Other special sufferings are beyond words. In addition, different customs and cultural backwardness all violate the principle of mutual prosperity. Moreover, according to the original Tao system, shrinking the province is already passed in the Fourth Plenary Session and will soon be implemented. The original Tao area should not be split and fragmented, first destroying the basis for changing the province. We believe that the division of the ten counties from Hebei is purely a warlord's private scheme, trapping the people in two years of helplessness. If the ten counties are划 back to Hebei, not only will the landlords be blessed, but it is also inevitable for the shrinking of the province. Or, fearing that if the ten counties are划 back to Hebei, how will Chahar Province be established? Not knowing that Chahar and Suiyuan each have their original areas, but only because of chaotic divisions, self-inflicted disputes. It is easy to restore the old system, the old cases are there, and the future division of the province is not difficult. Furthermore, if it is considered that the revision of provinces still needs comprehensive planning and there is no need for trivial changes, then as a temporary expedient, it may be possible to划 the five counties originally belonging to Chahar to Suiyuan, as well as the nine counties of Datong in northern Shanxi, and the four counties of Shuoping, to join Chahar Province. Their geography, history, and customs are not very different from those of the ten counties in Koubei. Shanxi will not lose much, only like Hebei losing Koubei, while Chahar Province will increase by these eighteen counties, which is easier to manage. Moreover, such a division will cut off the military connection between Shanxi and Suiyuan, making Shanxi lose its inner screen and outer barrier, and no longer hope to revive. This seems to be not without benefit to the country and the people. In addition to submitting copies to the Executive Yuan, the Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the Ministry of Interior, we hereby jointly submit this petition, respectfully requesting adoption and implementation, which would be truly beneficial.)</p>

<h3>War Clouds Spreading Again in Guizhou Province</h3>
<p>The Yunnan Army under Lu Han Retreated to Yunnan After Entering Guizhou</p>
<p>Bai Chongxi and Zhang Fakui Plot to Take Advantage of the Opportunity to Spy on Yunnan</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The military situation in Guizhou Province has recently changed again. Because the Zhang-Gui army failed in the north with Yan and Feng, they held a military conference in Liuzhou, deciding to make a final struggle and adopt a strategy of distant alliances and close attacks. They deeply knew that being trapped in a corner of Liuzhou and Yongzhou by the Eighth Route Army would not lead to a way out. Therefore, on the one hand, they exchanged envoys with the Eighth Route Army to negotiate a peaceful solution; on the other hand, they quickly gathered a large army and defeated the three divisions of the Yunnan Army under Lu Han and others who had entered Guizhou, intending to take advantage of the situation to drive troops into Yunnan. If they once occupied Yunnan as a base, they would abandon the entire Guizhou. Therefore, while Huang Shaoxiong and Wu Tingyang repeatedly sent representatives to Wuzhou to negotiate peace with the Eighth Route Army, the main force of the Zhang-Gui troops moved to the Left and Right Rivers to counterattack the Tenth Route Yunnan Army that had entered Guizhou. Before the event, they also mobilized Li Mingrui's troops in Longzhou to cut off the Yunnan Army's return route to Yunnan. In mid-month, Bai Chongxi suddenly led thousands of Gui troops, and Zhang Fakui led two divisions, advancing towards the Left and Right Rivers. The Yunnan Army was caught off guard and suffered considerable losses. However, the three divisions under Lu Han, Zhang Chong, and Zhu Xu, as well as another independent brigade, were gathered in the Pingma area. From the 11th to the 15th of this month, they fought fiercely with the Zhang-Gui army for five days and nights, with bloody hand-to-hand combat, which was a rare fierce battle in Guizhou Province in recent days. The Yunnan Army, as an isolated force that had penetrated deeply, was at a disadvantage in military terms and was forced to temporarily retreat to the border of Yunnan. Due to inconvenient transportation, many supplies were left behind. However, the Zhang-Gui army also suffered more than a thousand casualties in this battle, and the magnitude of the sacrifices on both sides can be imagined. After the Yunnan Army retreated to the border of Yunnan, they urgently sent a representative, Lu Yafu, to Wuzhou to report the Zhang-Gui army's tricks of verbally seeking peace to the Guangdong military authorities, requesting the Eighth Route Army to quickly send troops to pursue them, and the Yunnan Army would then return to cooperate in the attack. Lu Han, the commander of the Tenth Route Army, sent another telegram on the 22nd, requesting the Guangdong army to quickly attack Nanning to destroy the rear of the Zhang-Gui army that had entered Yunnan. The original telegram said: (The rebel army in Nanning, because our Eighth and Tenth Route Armies are determined to launch a two-pronged attack and recover Yongzhou within a short period of time, have mostly fled at the news. There are few rebel troops remaining in Yongzhou, only the remnants of Huang Xuchu's rebel forces and hundreds of militiamen, totaling no more than a thousand people. They can be taken down in one fell swoop. I hereby telegraph this, Lu Han, seal). While Lu's Yunnan Army urgently telegraphed Guangdong for a swift attack, they deployed troops in the Boai area to prevent the Zhang-Gui army from intruding into Yunnan. At the same time, they urgently telegraphed Long Yun to send troops to the Yunnan border. It is reported that Long Yun had a message about personally leading the troops. The vanguard of four or five elite regiments has been dispatched from Kunming to Guangnan to rush to Boai, coordinating with Lu's troops to prepare for a counterattack on Bose. According to intelligence reports, after the Zhang-Gui army split up and left the Left and Right Rivers, the Gui army, led by Bai Chongxi, with Huang Xuchu and Wei Yunsong's troops, totaling about 3,000 people, advanced into Bose from Enlong on the 20th of this month. Zhang Fakui led Yang Tenghui and other troops, detouring from Longzhou, plotting to attack Mengzi. Zhang's army has recently arrived in Longzhou, first disarming Lin Juntian's gray army, and then entering Yunnan. In addition, Li Pinxian, the former Gui army division commander, transported weapons from Annam to Longzhou to supply the Zhang-Gui army, and further plotted to mobilize disgruntled military personnel in Yunnan Province to respond internally. To prevent the activities of the remnants of the Zhang-Gui forces, the local authorities have ordered Chen Yangchu, the former representative stationed in Guizhou, to telegraph Mao Guangxiang, the chairman of Guizhou, to quickly order Wang Jialie's division stationed in western Hunan to return to Guizhou, detouring through western Guizhou, Chang'an, and Liuzhou, to coordinate with the Yunnan Army to intercept the Gui-Zhang army. The original telegram said: (To Chairman Mao Guangxiang of the Guizhou Provincial Government: I have repeatedly received your telegrams ordering Shao Wu (i.e., Wang Jialie, the commander of the Guizhou Army vanguard) to quickly pacify western Hunan and move troops to Changliu to assist in suppressing the rebellion and carry out the original intentions. I am deeply grateful. Commander Bo Nan (Chen Jitang) has returned to Wuzhou to supervise the troops and eliminate the remaining enemies. Please telegraph Shao Wu to hurry into Guizhou to facilitate military operations. I am greatly expectant, your brother Yangchu bows). It is now reported that Long Yun, the chairman of Yunnan, has personally led a large army to Guangnan, giving Bai Chongxi a head-on blow. If the Guizhou army joins in, the focus of the war in Guizhou Province will shift to western Guizhou (November 27).</p>
<h3>Bandit Party Captured in Guangzhou Bombing Case</h3>
<p>Bandit Leader Jian Wei Repeatedly Extorted Money, Leading to the Leak of Information</p>
<p>Police Team Went to Xinzhao to Encircle and Capture the Whole Gang</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Several months ago, a case occurred in the Henan area of Guangzhou in which bandits hid bombs and bombed a theater, killing and injuring many actors. For months, the criminals remained at large. The authorities ordered their subordinates to intensify their pursuit. Until the beginning of this month, the bandit leader Jian Wei relapsed and continued to send letters to various theater troupes, extorting money. The Public Security Bureau's detective team took the opportunity to investigate the bandit's whereabouts in order to solve the case. The gang recently solicited fees from a certain actor of the Renshou Nian opera troupe, which was discovered by the detectives. They agreed with the actor to act according to plan, first having the actor send a letter to the bandit, promising to provide the full amount, instructing him to send someone to the vicinity of the Taikoo Warehouse in Baixianke, outside Henan, to hand over the fee and gifts (the bandit extorted over a thousand Hong Kong dollars from the Yongshounian troupe, as well as ten bolts of wool, twenty-four sweaters, four camel wool blankets, fifteen boxes of Three Cannons cigarettes, and six ounces of opium paste). After receiving the troupe's reply, the bandit leader Jian Wei sent his wife, Jian Luo, and an accomplice, Huang Qian, to the designated location on the 24th, intending to receive the money and gifts. However, as soon as they arrived at the site, the detectives of the Public Security Bureau, who had been lying in ambush all around, gave a signal and suddenly captured the two bandits. A receipt was found on the bandit's wife, which had been filled out in advance, ready to be handed over to the gift-giver as proof of receiving the loot. The detectives then took the two bandits to the Public Security Bureau for strict interrogation. The bandit's wife directly admitted that she was the wife of the bandit leader Jian Wei, and Huang Qian was an accomplice. Jian Wei was now hiding in the private ancestral hall of the Li family in Nanyue, Xinzhao Market, Panyu County. Since the Xin Zhongyuan opera troupe was performing in Xinzhao Market these days, Jian Wei intended to extort money from the troupe, so he led several accomplices to follow the troupe to the market in order to negotiate with them. After receiving the confession, the Criminal Investigation Division submitted a report to the director, immediately dispatching Liang, the chief of the Special Criminal Investigation Division, and more than 20 team members, along with 30 members of the Security Team, to take a boat to Xinzhou at 8 pm that night. At dawn on the 25th, they followed the land route to Xinzhao Market and surrounded the bandit's nest in the Li family's ancestral hall. Team members broke down the door and went straight in. At the time, several bandits in the house were still sleeping soundly. When they heard the sound of gunfire, they scrambled to escape, but the roads had been cut off. The bandit leader Jian Wei led four accomplices to open fire and resist arrest. The bandit's vanguard Luo Zhi was the fiercest, attempting to break through the encirclement, but was eventually shot and killed. At the same time, the bandit leader Jian Wei also died in the crossfire. The remaining three bandits surrendered. The police team found a box of ink pads on the bandit's table, containing a bandit gang wooden seal (Fan Yi Hong Sheng Tang), a Jian Wei seal in seal script, and several other small chops, as well as more than 30 extortion letters. After the police team withdrew, they sent the bandits' corpses and those captured alive to the Provincial Public Security Bureau for verification and disposal. According to the confession of those captured alive, one named Jian Luo, 30 years old, from Panyu, was Jian Wei's wife and the younger sister of Luo Jihong, the bandit leader of the Chicken Hong Tang gang; another named Huang Qian (nickname Lan Gui), 29 years old (the above were captured in advance). As for those captured in the Xinzhao bandit's nest, there were three in total: one named Zhong Hu, 28 years old; one named Li Libei, 28 years old; and one named Li Heng, 27 years old, all from Panyu, who directly admitted to being in a gang with Jian Wei to loot and plunder. It is reported that the Public Security Bureau plans to sentence the bandit gang to death after recording their confessions (November 25).</p>
<h3>Headquarters Closes Rear Hospitals</h3>
<p>Wuhu's Two Hospitals Have Shipped Wounded Soldiers in Batches</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The central government's campaign to suppress the rebels this time was unprecedented in its ferocity, and the number of officers and soldiers wounded was also very large. Most of them were recuperating in rear military hospitals in various places. Now that the war has come to an end, the wounded armed comrades have been treated and nursed for a long time, and most of their wounds have healed. Even those with more severe injuries who have become disabled cannot be helped by medicine. Therefore, the Wounded Soldier Management Committee of the General Headquarters has decided to close the rear hospitals in various places and organize a clearing office to handle the matter. As for the closing method, the first step is to investigate those who have fully recovered, provide them with funds, and send them back to their original units. Those who have become disabled will be sent to the Central Disabled Hospital. Those who have not yet recovered will be respectively merged into the Army Hospital for treatment. The rear hospitals in the upper reaches, such as Hankou, have mostly been closed and completed. In recent days, wounded soldiers who have recovered have been passing through Wuhu and transported downstream to return to their units. Wuhu previously only had one Fifth Rear Hospital, located in the old town government office. As the number of wounded soldiers increased, a branch hospital was established in the Great Theater. Not long after, an accident occurred with the wounded soldiers of the Twenty-sixth Rear Hospital in Tong, killing officers and soldiers of the Provincial Garrison, and injuring several soldiers. For the convenience of management, it was relocated to Yuwang Palace on the south bank of Wuhu. Although those who had recovered were repeatedly sent back to their units, Wuhu still had 1,100 wounded soldiers. The clearing office of the General Headquarters Wounded Soldier Management Committee had already sent Sun Jianyuan, Liu Liu, and others to Wuhu to handle the closing of the Fifth and Twenty-sixth Hospitals, and dispatched the Guo Nan, Huayang, and Xing Shi vessels to transport them back and forth. Yesterday, the first batch of approximately 100 wounded soldiers returning to their units were loaded onto the Tu Nan vessel and sailed downstream. Tomorrow, the second batch of 300-400 wounded soldiers will be transported by the Huayang vessel. It is also reported that an Army Hospital will be established in the Anqing area to accommodate the unhealed wounded soldiers along the Yangtze River (November 29).</p>
<h3>Fujian Opium Suppression Commissioners Depart in Different Directions</h3>
<p>Five Commissioners Downstream Have Arrived in Xiamen</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The opium seedlings planted this year in the counties under the jurisdiction of Quanzhou in southern Fujian have mostly emerged from the soil by several inches. The counties under the jurisdiction of Zhangzhou are also in the process of planting. In order to strictly eradicate the poisonous plants, the provincial government has specially sent representatives from the Party, government, and military as opium suppression commissioners to go to Fuxingning upstream and Zhangquanyong downstream to publicize the ban on planting and urge the county government and the garrison to eradicate the opium seedlings. The special commissioners for investigating and suppressing opium seedlings in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou are Liu Chengqing, Gu Fangbai, Chen Xiaogao, Zhang Xiangpu, and Shi Ming. They arrived in Xiamen on the 24th and received news reporters on the 25th, explaining the responsibility they bore for urging the county government and the garrison to eradicate the opium seedlings. On the 26th, the Siming Steering Committee convened people from all walks of life to hold a conference to ban the planting of opium seedlings. All the commissioners attended the meeting. Gu Fangbai gave a speech and proposed on the spot that the central and provincial governments be strongly requested to order all garrisons in southern Fujian to take responsibility for thoroughly eradicating the opium seedlings in order to maintain the opium ban. On the 27th, the five commissioners departed for Tong'an to conduct an on-site inspection, followed by the counties under the jurisdiction of Quanzhou and Yongchun, and finally inspected the counties under the jurisdiction of Zhangzhou (November 28).</p>
<h3>Jiaoji Railway Revises Train Timetable</h3>
<p>Effective from December 1</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Jiaoji Railway suffered tremendous losses this year due to the impact of the war. After the end of the war, the railway has been making unremitting efforts to rectify the situation. However, recently, the trains have often been delayed, which not only causes losses to business but also endangers traffic. The reason for the delay is that the railway was damaged during the war, and the bridges were repaired urgently, which were not strong. Therefore, trains must pass slowly when passing over damaged bridges, which causes delays. Now, in order to remedy the situation, the railway administration has decided to revise the train schedule, lengthening the time for each train. The new schedule will take effect on December 1. The new train schedule is recorded below:</p>
<p>(A) Passenger Train (1) Upward Train (Jinan to Qingdao) Train 6: Departs from Jinan at 8:30 am and arrives in Qingdao at 8:30 pm. Train 4: Departs from Jinan at 12:00 noon and arrives in Qingdao at 11:15 pm. Train 14: Departs from Jinan at 1:30 pm and arrives in Fangzi at 10:51 pm. Train 2: Departs from Jinan at 9:45 pm and arrives in Qingdao at 8:45 am the next morning. (2) Downward Train (Qingdao to Jinan) Train 1: Departs from Qingdao at 9:30 pm and arrives in Jinan at 8:03 am the next morning.

<h3>Jiangsu Department of Finance Changes Steps for Preparing Business Tax</h3>
<p>Wuxi Chamber of Commerce Publishes Another Opinion</p>
<p>Previously, because this province was preparing to abolish likin and levy a business tax, the Jiangsu Department of Finance drafted regulations and submitted them to the provincial government for review. Furthermore, since the business tax must be prepared before the abolition of likin is implemented, in order to avoid delays, it was proposed to first handle business tobacco license donations as a transitional method. Representatives from various county chambers of commerce were convened to discuss this. Subsequently, based on the request of the representatives, it was changed to preparing for the collection of business tax registration fees, and the regulations were revised. After being approved and promulgated by the provincial government, the department issued a notice to various county bureaus to comply and appointed micro-collection directors to go to various county bureaus to implement the commencement. Now, Director Chen of the Department believes that the Fourth Plenary Session of this session has decided to implement the abolition of likin in January 20, and the central government has determined the date of the abolition of likin. Therefore, the original business tax preparation plan of this province should be changed accordingly, and all provisions for collecting business registration fees should be notified to the various county finance bureaus to temporarily suspend collection. The various county bureaus should supervise the various directors to follow the previously issued form format and first start with investigation, separately registering and compiling a register for submission. For investigating various merchants, only a registration certificate fee of two cents will be collected. After the investigation and registration are completed, the central government will implement the abolition of likin and immediately begin to handle the business tax. As for the types of business taxes to be levied and the calculation standards, further research and proper regulations are still needed. The provincial government has been requested to transfer the matter to the Ministry of Finance for verification and instructions, and a business tax preparation committee will be convened again to discuss everything in order to proceed.</p>
<p>The Wuxi Chamber of Commerce Requests the Provincial Department to Temporarily Suspend the Collection of Registration Fees for the Business Tax Being Organized in Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>It has been reported that the Provincial Department has resolved to change the steps and reconvene the Business Tax Preparation Committee to continue the discussion. Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the various committee members expressing their opinions. The original text is as follows: To the Public of the Business Tax Preparation Committee: It is reported in the newspapers that at the 352nd meeting of the Provincial Government on November 28, in the third case, Commissioner Chen, who is also the Director of the Department of Finance, proposed that in order for the central government to announce the date of the abolition of likin, the original steps for proceeding with the business tax in this province should be slightly changed, and the Business Tax Preparation Committee should be reconvened for discussion and a decision should be requested. It was resolved to proceed accordingly. It is heard that the Provisional Regulations for Business License Donations and its implementation details originally ordered by Jiangsu Province were drafted by the honorable members, and that the subsequent change in name to the Regulations for Collecting Registration Fees for Preparing Business Tax and its implementation details, as the name implies, is believed that the honorable members must also personally participate in it. Our association is remotely located among the common people and has limited knowledge. We silently speculate that the honorable members are either famous people of the time who have long studied accounting or financial experts who are familiar with economics. They are indeed outstanding talents of the time. In July 17th year of the Republic [1928], the Ministry of Finance convened a national financial conference, and the Likin Abolition Committee formulated nine general outlines for the collection of business tax in various provinces, which were published in the newspapers. It is believed that the honorable members must have been among those present that day. However, the various regulations for preparing business tax that Jiangsu Province has successively issued seem to conflict with the previous events. At its meeting of representatives from various industries on November 20, our association, based on the general outline ordered by the ministry, proposed the essential points that should be decided first. We telegraphed the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce to bring the case to the ministry and the province for verification and handling. This was revealed in the newspapers, inviting attention. Now, it is fortunate that the various chambers of commerce have successively sent replies agreeing. It is also fortunate that the Jiangsu Provincial Government has reconvened the honorable members of the committee to change the steps. We sincerely hope that the honorable members will still revise it again based on the general outline ordered by the ministry in the 17th year of the Republic. We have attached a copy of our association's telegraphic manuscript for your selection. There is no absolute good or bad in taxation. It all depends on whether the method is appropriate. Throughout history, all countries in the East and West that are regarded as civilized and advanced have invariably regarded extravagance and waste as a strict prohibition. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Business Tax Registration Fee Regulations not only collect registration fees but also separately establish magnetic card fees and registration certificate fees, increasing tax revenue. The first step in promoting tax revenue is to cultivate the tax base, not to distort learning to please the world, nor to disregard profit to harm the people. As the saying goes, only virtuous people can accept full words, and who can we expect if not the wise and enlightened honorable members? We hope that you will take it to heart.</p>

<h3>No Corruption Cases in Pei and Dang Counties</h3>
<p>Forged Banknotes and Embezzlement During Opium Confiscation</p>
<p>Eliminating Corrupt Officials Amidst the Call for Clean Governance</p>
<p>A dispatch from Xuzhou reports that the politics of various counties under its jurisdiction need to be rectified, especially the widespread issuance and smuggling of banknotes and opium, which are severely affecting society. Recently, two major cases occurred in Pei and Dang counties. One is the case of the Pei County government forging banknotes, and the other is the case of corruption during the opium confiscation in Dang County. Various groups have jointly filed accusations, causing a great uproar. The following is a record of the events:</p>
<p>The Forged Banknote Case in Pei County: Various sectors in Pei County, citing the lack of copper coins and the proliferation of local banknotes, which has led to the decline of commerce and harmed the common people, proposed to establish a new Pei Bank and print 200,000 strings of banknotes by using public funds allocated by the county government as a reserve fund to regulate finance and unify banknotes. However, counterfeit banknotes were suddenly discovered last month. After investigation by the bank, it was found that these counterfeit banknotes were issued by the accounting office of the county government. One day, the education bureau requested funds, and the funds given by the county government were all these counterfeit notes. Xu Xinquan, the chief of the accounting office, is the younger brother of the county magistrate, Xu Enzhao. The bank and relevant parties immediately went to the accounting office to investigate and found a large number of counterfeit banknotes piled up in the vault. When questioned about it, County Magistrate Xu hurriedly tried to cover it up and promised to be responsible for recovering them. However, all sectors still sent letters to the county government requesting that Xu Xinquan be held responsible and placed under surveillance, and jointly telegraphed to the provincial authorities to file accusations. The province then ordered the Feng County magistrate to investigate. The Feng County magistrate sent section chief Feng Zhao Hua to Pei County to interrogate Xu Xinquan. Xu only admitted to forging the banknotes himself. Various sectors in Pei County believed that County Magistrate Xu and his younger brother had colluded in corruption. They convened a joint meeting and appointed Zhang Lianyin, the president of the education association, and Li Weicang, the chairman of the chamber of commerce, and Li Ying, the storage and custody committee member, to appeal to the provincial government. Hu Peishan, the manager of the Xinpei Bank, and Li Shiqian, the director, also filed lawsuits in the High Court. The local community unanimously denied that Xu was the county magistrate. Xu has now been dismissed from his position and is awaiting investigation. The prosecution has not yet been resolved. All sectors in Pei County have decided to resolve the matter through legal means so that the perpetrators of the counterfeit banknote case will be subject to the law, and the case can be thoroughly investigated and clarified.</p>
<p>The Opium Embezzlement Case in Dangshan: The discovery of the opium case dates back to the 17th of last month. On that day, the third district police team of Dang County seized six handcarts of opium in Zhouzhai, packed in oil drums, totaling fourteen large drums, each drum containing about 1,200 taels, totaling more than 15,000 taels. Zhu Muyun, the district chief, reported to the county government the next day. However, the assistant clerks Wang Huatang and Sun Yanshu, and police officers, etc., embezzled a large amount of it. Only 1,900 taels were sent to the county government. However, Wang Enpu, the secretary of the county government, privately kept more than 300 taels. County Magistrate Wang Zhaoxiong then inspected and weighed a small amount, which he estimated to be about 1,100 taels, and embezzled several hundred taels. Later, Wang Enpu replaced several hundred taels with fake materials. By this time, the opium was almost exhausted. There was much talk outside, and Magistrate Wang knew that the opium had already been embezzled by subordinates. He then arrested and detained Zhu Muyun, Wang Huatang, and Sun Yanshu, demanding 5,000 yuan in silver dollars before releasing them. Zhu appealed to the party, and the Dang County Supervisory Committee also reported the matter. The county executive committee has reported to the provincial party headquarters and forwarded it to the provincial government, stating that Zhu, Wang, and Sun are currently in custody, and Wang and Sun have also admitted to stealing the opium. Secretary Wang withheld the opium and replaced it with fake materials. County Magistrate Wang abused his authority, hoping to gain something, and was negligent in his duties. They requested that he be dismissed and punished. This case has not yet been resolved, and the internal situation is quite complicated. A thorough investigation is still needed to resolve it.

<p>Change of Trial Judge: The trial judge of this county, Shen Yansheng, has been transferred to Changshu. Lin, the president of the Jiangsu High Court, has appointed Mr. Guo Enguang to replace him.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Party and Government Discussion Meeting: The County Party Rectification Committee convened the 17th Party and Government Discussion Meeting at 2:00 PM on the 1st. Wang Tianzu presided over the meeting, and the following results were achieved: (1) The Party Rectification Committee pointed out that the County Rent Collection Conference had invited landlords to attend and given them the right to speak and vote, which was inappropriate. In the future, their undue rights should be revoked to ensure fairness. (2) After the autumn harvest, the county government should order all districts to advise farmers to thoroughly dig up rice roots to eliminate rice borers. (3) The Finance Bureau proposed that the county be assigned to raise 80,000 yuan in construction bonds, with one-third to be raised and paid by the end of November, the end of December, and the end of January next year. Because the order was delayed, it was impossible to raise and pay the money. The neighboring counties had the same situation, and the local bureaus in all counties planned to request that this year's rice tax collection be attached to it. The case was decided to be rejected.</p>
<p>Fishermen's Boats Confiscated: Lu Xilin, a fisherman from Jinshanwei, was engaged in fishing for jellyfish. When passing through Yexie, he was accused by the anti-smuggling patrol team of salting jellyfish with private salt. The boat and goods were confiscated, and the stamped certificate issued by the Fish and Salt Inspection Office was destroyed, and a fine was imposed before being released. Later, the boat owner returned to report to the Fish and Salt Inspection Office. When Director Zhai heard about it, he believed that the credibility of the office was at stake and would negotiate with the captain of the team to reassure merchants.</p>
<p>Merchants Secretly Set Up Machines to Steal Rice: Chen, from Chengzi Temple Town in Tinglin District, Punan, opened the Dachang Rice Mill. He secretly set up a machine to hollow out the wooden feet of the windmill and nail them to the floor. A cellar was set up underground. When milling rice, the rice could leak from the hollow wooden feet of the windmill. The villagers have suffered from his calculations for many years and have suffered countless losses. After being discovered by the local Public Security Bureau, the merchant Chen was arrested and sent to the County Court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Rice Boats Stolen in Kaiyuan Township: Wu Yuchang, a Beijing goods store in Fangqiao Town, Yixing County, hired a boat to load rice on the 26th of last month to sell in Wuxi, earning more than 400 yuan. He then used the money to purchase a large number of cloth threads and Beijing goods and set sail back to Yixing. While traveling through Qianqiao Town, Kaiyuan Township, in the Fourth District of this county, it was already dusk, so he stopped the boat there for the night. At midnight, sixteen or seventeen bandits suddenly came in two small boats, armed with pistols and flashlights. As the town had the first resident station of the eighth branch of the Public Security Bureau, the bandits did not dare to board the boat to rob, but instead pushed the rice boat to Mao Lu Li and carried out a large-scale search of the boat. They bound the boat owner, Genhe, and his four sons, and left with the stolen goods, howling. After inspection, it was found that four yuan in cash and several thousand copper coins were robbed.</p>
<p>A Large Group of Kidnappers Escorted to Town for Interrogation: In the Shaojiawan Xiaoqiaotou area between Taibo and Jingyun, five families were robbed and seven men and women were kidnapped during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

Except for Lu Shaoda, who was left in Shanghai and sentenced to five years in the Western Prison and will be brought back to Wuxi for interrogation after serving his sentence, the remaining nineteen people were escorted from Shanghai to Wuxi the day before yesterday. The Detective Team interrogated each criminal in detail overnight, and all the criminals have confessed in detail. They will be handed over to the County Justice Bureau for interrogation. The kidnappers in this case were all salt smugglers. Before the incident, they went to the countryside to sell private salt, surveyed the terrain, and took the opportunity to inquire about the names of wealthy people in the countryside. Ma Liangchen, the leader of the bandits, had served as the chief of the anti-smuggling camp in Liangzhe and had a deep relationship with salt smugglers. It is also reported that the kidnappers in this case were divided into two gangs, one from Anhui with five people and one from Jiangbei with more than twenty people. When committing the crime, they brought eleven guns and seven Mauser pistols. Before committing the crime, they all drew blood and swore an oath that after the case was solved, no one would implicate others.</p>

<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Xinnianyang Case Solved: In recent days, several people resembling soldiers have been found inside and outside the city walls of our city, specializing in pouring water into glass bottles and intentionally hitting people, throwing the bottles to the ground, claiming that this is a very valuable medicine from Nanjing, and it is difficult to explain once it is broken, and as a result, they have to pay for it. There have been several cases of Xinnianyang victims before. On the 27th, the Public Security Bureau learned about it and went to Tongfu Hotel to search and found many empty bottles. They arrested a man named Wang Kemin who was wearing a military uniform. Wang was hiding under the bed when he was dragged out by the police.

He was accidentally noticed by Patrol Chief Shi Zhixing, who was sitting next to him. When the opium paste was bought, Shi immediately stepped forward to inspect Xu and found a piece of opium paste. He then took him to the bureau and sent him to the county.</p>
<p>Pinghu Second Elementary School Changes Principal: Xu Hebi, the principal of the Pinghu Chengdong Second Elementary School, has been managing the school with excellent results. Last year, due to disagreements with a certain gentleman of the Education Committee, he took a long leave of absence due to illness and handed over the school affairs to the teacher Ding Jinji to maintain and reported to the Education Bureau for record. For the past year, all the teachers have been enthusiastic in their service and the situation is the same as when Principal Xu was at school. A certain Beijing official, Chen, mistakenly listened to others and forced the Education Bureau to dismiss Xu. The public opinion was in an uproar. Ding Jinji was entrusted by Xu and worked hard, and even if he had no merit, he would never make mistakes. If the Education Bureau believes that it is not good, it is his own fault and has nothing to do with Xu. Therefore, he has requested the county government to clearly declare how the school affairs have been neglected and order Xu to be reinstated for the sake of fairness. If he is not reinstated, he requested that the new principal come to take over as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Military Police Repeatedly Assassinated: The First Squadron of the Huaiyin County Police Brigade has been stationed in the various market towns of the county. The team headquarters is located in Chenjiaji. Zhou Tingxiu, the squad leader of the team headquarters, has served as a soldier in the local garrison, the public security team, and now the police team, and has solved many bandit cases. At about 10:00 PM on the 23rd of the month, Zhou was taking a bath in the Chenji bathhouse and was shot from behind with a pistol when he went out to the street. The bullet entered from the back of his head and exited from the corner of his forehead, and he fell to the ground and died. After the team headquarters learned of the incident, it sent people to pursue the murderer, but he was nowhere to be found. Also, Tao Qiyuan, a patrol officer of the Fourth Branch of the County Public Security Bureau, was shot in the back with a gun by bandits at Xiaobakou at 4:00 PM on the 27th while collecting donations in Yangzhuang in the county. He was hit by a total of three bullets and died immediately. After the local authorities went to arrest the bandits, they were nowhere to be found. It is reported that Tao was from Matou Town in this county and is currently working in the Matou Public Security Fourth Branch. He had previously served as a patrol officer and director of various urban and rural branches. It is difficult to know whether he had any enemies for the time being. After the incident last night (the night of the 27th), the Fourth Branch sent people to Yangzhuang to guard the body and reported to the city to request that the main bureau transfer to the county for investigation and arrest of the murderer.</p>

Except for the Hang-Chang line, which will be completed soon, the rest have been completed one after another. It is now learned that the bureau has submitted the surveys and budgets for the Xin(chang)-Lin(hai), Lin(hai)-Feng(hua), and Hai(yan)-Wen(ling) three highways to the provincial government for approval. However, due to the unfinished construction of other roads, the project has been delayed until now.

<p>Yesterday, I read the local correspondence column of your newspaper on November 28, which contained a report that a rogue in Chenmu Town, Wuxian County, was taking advantage of his power to extort money from villagers. The County Public Security Bureau stated in its reply to Qian Peng, the director of the 15th Branch, that the case was that Zou Xiwu, Wang Zeyu, and others from Zhensi privately reconciled with Liao Hongyi and others at the District Office. After reading it, I was surprised. I have never consulted on the case, and I do not know the truth. However, on November 22, I went to visit District Chief Yan and happened to see that Director Qian was also present. According to him, Liao was willing to return all the extorted money to the victims and begged to be spared from further investigation in the future. I thought that it was better to leave a way out for him and did not want to add fuel to the fire. The newspaper report does not match the facts and may confuse the public. Therefore, I am writing to request that this be published in the letters column to clarify the truth. Zou Xiwu and Wang Zeyu, Chenmu Town, November 30.</p>

<h3>Vocational Education Society's Twelfth Academic Lecture</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, the China Vocational Education Society invited Dr. Shou Jingwei to lecture on "China's Financial Problems." Dr. Shou first discussed the financial history of various European and American countries and the drawbacks of China's inability to unify its finances. He then spoke on the principles of economics, essentially stating that, in this period of political tutelage, there are countless tasks for national construction, and it is necessary to determine priorities and implement them step by step. The success of promoting benefits and eliminating drawbacks depends on the proper application of financial resources. Therefore, those who control financial power must not only have a wealth of economic knowledge but also understand the conditions of various industries and study sociology for a deep understanding of the endeavors. Only by consistently aiming to benefit the people can long-term plans be realized. He concluded by expressing hope that the Chinese government would abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, improve the economic system, and establish a budget so that all industries could flourish. Dr. Shou mentioned that the scope of the problem was too large and planned to deliver his lecture in two parts; he will continue to speak on practical financial methods next Saturday (the 6th) at four o'clock in the afternoon. Although the topic is specialized, finance is closely related to personal economics and is essential knowledge for every citizen. The Society welcomes everyone to attend.</p>
<h3>Scout Leader Ren Erong Tragically Drowns</h3>
<p>The Current is Heartless; Swimmers Beware</p>
<p>Mr. Ren Erong, a former Standing Committee member of the Shanghai Scouting Advancement Association, was originally from Hunan and a graduate of the Huangpu Military Academy. He was known for his sincerity, simplicity, amiability, and lofty aspirations from a young age. In the autumn of the fifteenth year, he followed the army on the Northern Expedition. After establishing Shanghai, he entered Labor University to study. Mr. Ren felt that scouting training could save China's youth from decline and degradation. Appropriately, in the summer of the seventeenth year, when the central government established a national training school for instructors, Mr. Ren was sent by the municipal Party headquarters and, after graduating, became a scouting instructor at Jida University. This spring, he accepted a position as a trainer at a Xiamen middle school. On the seventeenth of last month, he led his team to Zhangzhou and camped out. On the morning of the nineteenth, he went swimming in the Longjiang River. However, Mr. Ren had only recently recovered from an illness, and the river was close to the sea, with deep and rapid currents. He suddenly ran out of strength midway and tragically drowned. His body has not yet been recovered. The shocking news has deeply saddened the Shanghai scouting community. It is said that a memorial service will be held soon to console his spirit.</p>

<h3>A Brief Biography of Mr. Zhao</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhao, given name Shiming, courtesy name Shumin, was from Xinhui County, Guangdong. He lost his mother at a young age and was raised by his aunt, Ms. Li. From a young age, he was intelligent and eager to learn. At the age of sixteen, he studied at the Shanghai YMCA Middle School and then transferred to the Commercial Department of Fudan University, where he graduated at the top of his class with a Bachelor of Commerce degree. Mr. Zhao loved sports and excelled at basketball, serving as captain of various basketball teams and winning many championships and awards. For a time, he was regarded as a strong athlete. In recent years, Mr. Zeng Renzhi asked him to engage in commerce, but Mr. Zhao, being skilled in education, politics, and social affairs, held great ambitions and was unwilling to work alongside ordinary businessmen. He politely asked his uncle, Mr. Zhi Zhi, to establish schools in the Education Bureau of Shunde County, Guangdong Province, which his uncle agreed to. After arriving in Guangdong, he made remarkable achievements in educational facilities. Most recently, he served as an English secretary at the National Seamen's Union, mediating many labor disputes. He often stated that he would strive for the liberation of Chinese sailors at the International Labor Conference in the future. This was Mr. Zhao's lifelong ambition. Mr. Zhao was twenty-nine years old and unmarried. In mid-October of this year, he contracted a fever and sought medical treatment at Baolong Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective. He passed away on the afternoon of November 8th. He was buried the following day at the Guangzhao Villa in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Central University Sports Magazine Continues Publication</h3>
<p>The "Sports Magazine," edited by the Physical Education Department of Central University, has already published two issues and has been popular throughout the country. It is truly the only publication dedicated to sports promotion. At the beginning of this semester, due to problems with the department head, it could not be published as scheduled. Now, the department's office meeting has decided to continue its efforts to meet the urgent needs of the sports community in the country. Two news items regarding this matter are extracted below:</p>
<p>Call for Articles for the "How to Effectively Promote Sports Special Issue" of Sports Magazine: Since the implementation of new education in our country, those responsible for education all know that physical education is a tool for cultivating a sound personality and is therefore listed as one of the five areas of education. However, it has ultimately been treated as a mere formality and has not been vigorously implemented, which is regrettable. At the Fourth Plenary Session, Comrade Zhang Xueliang proposed paying attention to physical education to strengthen the national physique and promote the national spirit. The conference decided to instruct the relevant authorities of the National Government to earnestly implement it, which shows that key Party and government figures also care about promoting physical education. However, it is necessary to discuss how to effectively carry out physical education in the future. This department is responsible for publishing a special issue on "How to Effectively Promote Sports" (soliciting opinions from experts on concrete plans and systematic research on the theoretical and practical aspects of effectively carrying out physical education, which will benefit the future of sports and the Party-state in our country). People across the country are urged to contribute generously, so as not to let down the good intentions of key Party and government figures in promoting physical education. Article guidelines: 1. The length of the article is not limited. 2. The content of the article should fall into one of the following five categories: A. Mass sports, B. School sports, C. Sports administration, D. Women's sports, E. Military sports. 3. Selected articles will be paid between nine and twenty yuan. 4. The deadline for submissions is February 15, 2021, starting from the date of publication. 5. Please indicate your name and address on the manuscript and include a seal. 6. If you do not wish to publish your real name, please state so in advance. 7. Please send submissions to the Physical Education Department of Central University in the capital. 8. Manuscripts will not be returned, except for those longer than 5,000 words with prior notice.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor: To the Editor: The news in various newspapers on November 30th that I will be appointed President of the School of Social Sciences at China Public School is completely false. I would be grateful if you could correct this. Sincerely, Wang Yun, December 1, 1959</p>

<h3>Taxpayers' Association to Convene a Delegate Assembly Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Declaration of the Support Association for Expelled Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Recounting the Suffering of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Declaration of the Support Association for Promoting National Diplomacy for Expelled Overseas Chinese from British and Dutch Southeast Asia: Dear compatriots, dear comrades, do you know that millions of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are suffering from the extremely cruel oppression of British and Dutch imperialism? Do you know that millions of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are in deep water and fierce fire? Have you ever heard the cries of pain from the overseas Chinese? Have you ever imagined the plight of the overseas Chinese? We, who have been expelled from under the iron heel of British and Dutch imperialism and returned to our country, have been subjected to tyrannical policies and harsh laws: arrest, imprisonment, deportation, and various inhuman tortures. The reason for offending them is only because we propagate the Three Principles of the People, work hard for our Party, develop overseas Chinese education, and uphold just opinions. Although we have returned from the tiger's mouth with scars and tears, there are still countless members of the great Chinese nation, overseas Chinese in British and Dutch Southeast Asia, who are still wailing and groaning under the butcher knives of imperialism. They will also be expelled in an endless stream, and they will be slaughtered like weak lambs. Therefore, we dare not rest easy after escaping death, and we cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the suffering of our overseas Chinese compatriots without helping them. We have gathered together in adversity to rescue our tragically suffering overseas Chinese compatriots in the abyss, unite under the revolutionary banner of the Three Principles of the People, stand guard in front of the British and Dutch imperialist front, and hope that our shouts can arouse the sympathy of the people of the whole country and encourage them to bravely and continuously pursue and charge the British and Dutch imperialist front. Sir Cecil Clementi, the Governor of British Malaya and Singapore, when he was the Governor of Hong Kong, specialized in colluding with and condoning the anti-revolutionary elements and traitors in our country, endangering the revolution of our Party and prolonging the internal turmoil of our country. His conspiracies and tricks have long been deeply imprinted in the minds of the people of the country. This year, when he was transferred to Singapore as Governor, he became even more arrogant and tyrannical, displaying his imperialist power to the fullest. He summoned the executive and supervisory committee members of the South Seas General Branch of our Party for a conversation, immediately ordered them to cease activities, and set a deadline for the dissolution of the various Party branches in Malaya. He expelled Zheng Luosheng and Fang Zhizhen, standing committee members of the General Branch, and imprisoned Luo Ciqi, standing committee member of the 12th Branch of the Perak Branch, for as long as four months, inflicting the most cruel torture on him. He was deported out of the country with the laws of bandits and soldiers, handcuffed and shackled. At the same time, more than 180 overseas Chinese were expelled, and seven of them died due to excessive abuse during the four days of deportation. He also detained Zeng Ziying, standing committee member of the Sandakan Branch in North Borneo, and executive committee members Cao Ruiwu and Xia Xianwo, and deported them back to China with various forms of mistreatment. Even the most barbaric nations in the world would not be so cruel. There are also many comrades working for the Party who are still in prison. He also burned Party ideology books, banned words and images that alluded to our Party, prohibited overseas Chinese from commemorating national humiliation by flying flags at half-mast, and never allowed them to hang Party badges. He restricted the entry of Chinese people, excluded unemployed workers, and threatened, intimidated, arbitrarily imprisoned, and massacred all those who advocated patriotic movements and promoted domestic goods. He set up registration requirements to destroy overseas Chinese education and harsh laws to control Chinese newspapers. The intention is not difficult to think about. This is all a tragedy orchestrated by Clementi. Several years ago, when overseas Chinese in Singapore held a meeting to commemorate the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, the police suddenly opened fire on the Chinese crowd, killing dozens of people and seriously injuring countless others. This case has not yet been resolved. They are so dark and so barbaric that they are not only the public enemies of our people, but also the public enemies of all mankind. As for the stubbornness and violence with which Dutch imperialism treats overseas Chinese, it is a rare and obscure misdeed in the international community. In Mengjiaxi alone, in the recent February, as many as five people were unreasonably expelled. For example, Liao Peizhi, editor of the Min Sheng Bao, which was run by our Party, was repeatedly fined and interrogated for publishing propaganda texts of our Party, and was eventually expelled. Feng Hanyue, the principal of the Zhongshan Public School, which was established by the Party, was repeatedly interrogated and imprisoned for implementing Party-oriented education, and then expelled. Similarly, Chen Guanqun, the successor editor of the Min Sheng Bao, Pan Fengjing, a female teacher at the Zhongshan Public School, and Chen Zhongshu, a female teacher at the Zhonghua School, were all refused residence and sent back to China less than a month after arriving in the port. There have been a series of tragedies in the past few years, such as the Shengwasheng tragedy, in which 13 people were shot dead, 28 were seriously injured, 19 were arrested and imprisoned, and countless were deported back to China. Police in Wu Shudong shot and killed many Chinese workers and refused to allow our consuls to investigate. There have also been police shootings of Chinese workers in Sumatra. Recently, when a Chinese-owned shop in the Tanah Grogot oil field in East Borneo caught fire, the local government refused to allow the water hoses to be turned on to put out the fire, and the entire port was burned down. The losses to the overseas Chinese amounted to more than one million. There are also harsh laws that have become established practices, such as: (1) The Chinese entry tax has been increased from 25 guilders to 50 guilders, then to 100 guilders, and will be increased to 150 guilders next year. (2) When Chinese people land, they must first taste the iron windows of the detention center, and then have someone sign a guarantee before they can be released, and then they must find ways to go through many procedures before they can obtain a residence permit. (3) Whether Chinese people are engaged in business or work, they must pay 30% of their hard-earned money to the local government every year in head taxes and various other harsh taxes. (4) If there is no will for Chinese people's inheritance, it will be confiscated; if there is any ambiguity in the will, or if the heir is young, the local government often forces it to be managed on its behalf and then confiscates it invisibly. (5) It is forbidden for overseas Chinese to hang portraits of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and books on the Three Principles of the People are strictly prohibited from entering the country. Teachers in Chinese schools are not allowed to teach courses on Party ideology, and newspapers are restricted from publishing texts that promote our Party and advocate patriotism. (6) Overseas Chinese are not allowed to commemorate national humiliation by flying flags at half-mast. (7) Overseas Chinese students and Chinese people are forced to become indigenous people and suffer the same abuse. Overseas Chinese students and Chinese people who commit crimes are exiled to barren islands and imprisoned for life. Such atrocities cannot be described in a single text. As for the colonial government of Dutch imperialism, it despises the negotiations of our consuls and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The crew members of the Dutch-owned Zha Wa Company's ships raped our women. The rape of Ms. Xiao Xin'an is a prominent example. They dare to say that this is a great act of wrong and do whatever they want, leaving a great stain on humanity. It is not only the Chinese people who hate it, but it may also be resented by all mankind in the world. Dear compatriots, dear comrades, have you ever heard such tragic cries from the overseas Chinese? Have you ever imagined such a difficult situation for the overseas Chinese? Do you know that the transformation of a barren and desolate land into the glittering and splendid Southeast Asia is purely at the cost of the overseas Chinese's sweat, tears, and blood? Do you know that British and Dutch imperialism has concealed the miraculous achievements of the overseas Chinese and treats overseas Chinese worse than cattle and horses? Do you also know that overseas Chinese donated their wealth and drove their wheels to support the revolutionary cause of the motherland? Do you still remember the enthusiastic assistance of the overseas Chinese in the May 30th and Jinan massacres? We were originally an excellent and advanced nation, and everyone is endowed with a sincere and loving heart, and everyone has a fervent and surging blood. How can our Party overthrow British and Dutch imperialism? How can we alleviate the suffering of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia? Our organization is not a disorganized mob, and our cries are not moans without illness. We should have concrete methods and strict steps to achieve our final victory. At the lowest limit, we should (1) ask the Central Government to telegraph our ambassador to Britain, requesting the British government to remove Sir Cecil Clementi, the Governor of Singapore, from his post; (2) restore the original state of our Party's activities in British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies; (3) repeal all bans that are hostile to our Party and undermine diplomatic relations; (4) compensate the victims of the tragedies and promise to protect overseas Chinese better in the future; (5) revise the Sino-Dutch trade treaty, abolish the Chinese population tax, and other harsh entry requirements; (6) abolish the Chinese People's Protective Department and other special agencies set up for Chinese people; (7) overseas Chinese in British and Dutch colonies should receive equal treatment with Europeans and Americans. If British and Dutch imperialism still ignores it, we can only swear to boycott and declare economic severance. The success of the Three Principles of the People revolution is the doomsday of imperialist collapse. Now that the reactionary forces in the country have been eliminated and the glory of peaceful unification has reappeared, we should make the same happiness available for overseas Chinese to enjoy, considering the great achievements of overseas Chinese in the revolution of the motherland. We have to overthrow British and Dutch imperialism and elevate overseas Chinese to the position of dignity. On the one hand, we sincerely ask our Central Government to be pioneers for the people and capture British and Dutch imperialism, and on the other hand, we warmly ask compatriots and comrades across the country to rise up together to form a support association for diplomacy with Britain and the Netherlands, and provide a backing for the diplomacy of the National Government, and pursue and storm the British and Dutch imperialist front. Nanyang British-owned expelled Overseas Chinese Zheng Luosheng, Fang Zhizhen, Luo Ciqi, Zeng Ziying, Cao Ruiwu, Xia Xianjue, Dutch-owned expelled Overseas Chinese Liao Peizhi, Feng Hanyue, Chen Guanqun, Pan Fengjing, Chen Zhongshu, etc., cried at the Nanjing Wuzhou Park Central Reception Office for Overseas Comrades, Republic of China, November 22, 1919</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Federation Hosts Expelled Overseas Chinese and the Japanese Press</h3>
<p>Xu Jigong, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Federation, hosted all members of the Japanese press in Shanghai last night, as well as the overseas Chinese expelled by the British and Dutch, including Zheng Luosheng, Feng Hanyue, Luo Ciqi, Liao Peizhi, and Zeng Ziying. During the banquet, Mr. Xu gave a speech, stating that both the British and Dutch territories have close relations with China and Japan, and that we must unite to fight against the harsh laws imposed by the British and Dutch in their territories in Southeast Asia. Today, taking this opportunity, we ask you to express various matters that should be cooperated with in Southeast Asia, so as to discuss them. Subsequently, Lin Youren, a standing committee member of the Overseas Chinese Federation, rose to speak. Those who spoke after him included Wu Mai, Zheng Luosheng, Feng Hanyue, Liao Peizhi, and Luo Ciqi. Finally, the Japanese publicly elected a representative to answer. The discussion lasted for two hours before the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Construction of the Pudong Avenue Begins Today</h3>
<p>In the Pudong coastal area of this city, there are very few major roads for passage. To travel between various towns and villages, one often has to detour to Puxi, which is extremely inconvenient. It is learned that the Municipal Public Works Bureau has included the Pudong Avenue line in the city's major road plan. It starts from Zhoujiadu on the Shanghai-Nanchang Highway and ends at Donggou on the Shanghai-Chuansha Highway, with a total length of more than 17 kilometers. The planned width is 30 meters, and the temporary paved surface is ten feet wide. Construction has begun today and is expected to be completed within six months. From now on, traffic in the Pudong area should be greatly facilitated.</p>
<h3>The City Commenced Winter Defense Operations Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Safety Bureau commenced winter defense operations starting on the 1st. All district offices, which have vast jurisdictions, large populations, and limited police resources, have expanded the number of police squads, forming six squads. They are assigned to reside permanently within the jurisdictions of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh districts, as well as the length of each public office’s jurisdiction, the prosperity or decline of the market, and the size of the population, to assist in defense. The areas of the fourth and fifth districts have been re-divided to compensate for shortcomings, to avoid being out of reach. Director Yuan also instructed the captains of each district office and squad to pay attention to nighttime defense. After 6 PM every night, they must increase the number of patrol squads, dividing them into groups to patrol back and forth along the roads and alleys within their jurisdictions until 6 AM the next morning, when they can withdraw. Each officer should be stationed in the office every night, boosting morale, supervising officers and police, going out on patrol to check on the diligence or laziness of the officers, clearly defining rewards and punishments, and using them to encourage and deter. Detective Squad Leader Lu will also assign his detectives to reside in the designated district offices. Every night, the leading detectives will supervise them to go to the important passes and conduct plainclothes investigations. If theft or other cases occur within the jurisdiction, the detectives will be responsible for investigating to ensure accountability and prevent evasion. Therefore, starting from the evening of the 1st, on all the major and minor roads in the Chinese area, patrol officers in groups of five or six, carrying guns, patrolled back and forth all night without stopping. After 11 PM every night, at the intersection of Mingguo Road, Zhonghua Road, and the Chinese-Concession border, whenever they encounter pedestrians who appear suspicious or are walking at night, the patrol police and male and female detectives must conduct a thorough interrogation and search, asking about their profession and address before allowing them to pass. The defense is quite strict, it is said.</p>
<h3>Police Personnel Must Not Be Absent from Duty</h3>
<p>Director Yuan Reiterates Prohibition Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau Instructs All District Offices and Squads: An order to be followed. Police personnel bear local responsibility and cannot be absent from their duties for even a moment. Hence the slogan, "Police do not sleep or rest." This city is a prosperous commercial port in the country, bordering concessions, with people from all directions gathering here. The security situation is more important than in other places. Since taking office, the Director has repeatedly and strictly cautioned internal and external colleagues, hoping that everyone will maintain their usual dedication and tirelessly work together to maintain peace and order. The district offices and squads are directly and closely related to the local people, and there is no room for even the slightest negligence. From the district office and squad leaders down, everyone should eat meals at the office, which has been ordered and followed in the past. However, family burdens are unavoidable for people. Out of consideration for his colleagues, the Director has specially designated one day a week for the district office chiefs to have a night off, allowing them to return home to rest and take care of family matters, so that they can focus on their duties and avoid being distracted by family affairs. This is fair and reasonable and truly serves both public and private interests. At the time, someone suggested that although the night off was specially allowed, it was feared that they might still not be on duty on other days. A trial phone call or sending someone to observe could immediately reveal the truth. Without strict supervision, it would be difficult to implement. However, the Director believes that he and his colleagues are one body and should treat each other with sincerity and harmony. It is not appropriate to harbor suspicions in advance. Moreover, colleagues have been in the police force for a long time and are well aware of their duties and responsibilities. Everyone should do their best and govern in their position. It is not like teaching children, where they still need guidance. It is not expected that treating people as unworthy while considering oneself wise will be effective in management. However, recently it has been heard that among the district office and squad leaders, there are those who follow the rules and work diligently, but there are also those who disregard the regulations and treat them as mere formalities. They often return home to sleep, and often do not eat both lunch and dinner at the district office. Eating dinner elsewhere is especially common. Since the district officials violate the orders themselves, the district officers and patrol officers follow suit. Even the patrol chiefs are sent elsewhere, and from 1 PM to 9 PM, almost the entire office is empty. Although extra police are assigned as a precaution, how can one expect others to work hard when one is at ease? Since being overworked is not tolerated, the results are naturally shallow. During these few hours, commonly known as the "twilight rush," when the streets are busy, all the criminals are taking advantage of the opportunity to move. If an unexpected major incident occurs and no one is responsible, even if people are gathered after repeated calls, the opportunity will be lost and the consequences will be unimaginable. Now that the winter defense has begun, it is a time when defense is particularly strained. It is necessary to strictly enforce police regulations and reiterate prohibitions to maintain discipline and rectify the situation. From now on, each district office and squad leader, in addition to the night off, will not be allowed to leave their posts without authorization unless there is a legitimate public duty or special reason and approval has been obtained. From the district office and squad leaders down, everyone must eat lunch and dinner at the office and must not return to their private homes or eat in restaurants. After this order is issued, if the above situation is found again, severe punishment will be imposed without leniency. If district officers and patrol chiefs violate this order, the officer in charge must report the facts, and those who fail to supervise and conceal the facts will be punished in the same way. Each district office and squad leader must remember that they are responsible for one area, serving as a model for their colleagues internally and as a guarantee for the people of the entire area externally. The lives and property of thousands of households within their jurisdiction depend on them. How can they endure temporary convenience and cause great negligence? If there is a fault, correct it; if there is none, strive for improvement. This is not a harsh condition, but a necessary measure. The superiors should lead by example, and the subordinates will naturally follow, so that a new atmosphere of renewal can be created. Therefore, this order is jointly issued to each district office and squad leader to be followed. This is a very important order. December 1, 19th year of the Republic of China, Director Yuan Liang.</p>
<h3>Implementing the New System of Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>Attention Architects and Engineers The Municipal Bureau of Public Works issued a notice to architects, engineers, etc., stating in brief: "The Uniform Regulations for Public Weights and Measures in this city have been promulgated by the Municipal Government. According to Article 2 of the regulations, December 31, 19th year, is the date for declaring the unification of public weights and measures in this city. Article 5 also stipulates that after the promulgation, when the people submit official documents or other documents involving weights and measures to various agencies, they should all comply with the standard system." Based on the above articles, all construction projects in the city that have been using the British-American system should be converted to the standard system, i.e., the metric system, to comply with the law. Therefore, this notice is issued: starting from January 1, 20th year, when applying to this Bureau for licenses for engineering projects, the numbers filled in on the drawings regarding length, area, etc., must all comply with the standard system. Violators will not be accepted.</p>
<h3>All Text in Construction Drawings Must Be in Chinese</h3>
<p>Attention to Those Applying for Licenses from the Municipal Bureau of Public Works The Municipal Bureau of Public Works stated that the drawings for license applications submitted by architects and engineers often use Western language explanations, which is not in accordance with the system. Therefore, a special notice was issued to architects and engineers yesterday that, starting from January 1, 20th year, when applying to this Bureau for licenses, all text in the drawings, except for numerals, must be written in Chinese. Violators will not be accepted, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Chinese Ships Resume Service</h3>
<p>Starting from December 1st, the Chinese ships on the South China Line will resume regular service. However, the Hong Kong authorities are very serious about ship inspections. Ships older than 20 years are not allowed to carry passengers into the port and are not given entry permits. Therefore, among the Chinese merchant ships sailing to Hong Kong, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company only has two ships. After the sinking of the Xinhua, only the Xinchang ship could go to Hong Kong. Since the military transport started last year, the Xinchang was requisitioned, and there were no Chinese ships going directly to Hong Kong. Today, in order to restore the Shanghai-Hong Kong line, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company specially overhauled the Xinchang, making it brand new. It officially resumed the Hong Kong route yesterday. The Guangli and Guangda ships will operate on the Shanghai-Xiamen-Guangdong and Shanghai-Shantou-Guangdong routes, respectively, and have been assigned specific routes.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Commerce Asks for Relief for Chongqing Silk</h3>
<p>More than 10 Representatives from Chongqing</p>
<p>Will Petition in Beijing Today</p>
<p>More than 10 silk merchant representatives from Sichuan, including Li Kuian, were specially invited to attend the industrial and commercial conference convened by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and came from afar. Mr. Li, as a standing committee member of the National Federation of Commerce, proposed at the 29th meeting of the Standing Committee that the government allocate funds to relieve the decline of Sichuan silk and passed the proposal. Yesterday, the National Federation of Commerce submitted a document to the National Government's Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating that the decline of Sichuan silk requires the allocation of funds for relief and a request to exempt taxes to maintain the industry. It stated, "On November 29th of this year, we received a letter from Sichuan silk merchant representatives Li Kuian, Chen Guangyu, Li Huijia, Wu Jifu, Feng Pen, Li Xiangwu, Zhao Yinchu, Tang Bomou, Zhang Xingyi, Yang Haifeng, Yu Shufang, and Li Wenlin, stating, 'Silk is a major export commodity of our country. Sichuan silk production is about 14,000 to 15,000 piculs per year, which is the source of livelihood for millions of people in Sichuan. In recent years, due to exorbitant taxes and levies and heavy exploitation, it has long been unsustainable. Recently, due to the boycott of Japanese silk and falling prices, it has reached the extreme. Even at the lowest prices, it is difficult to sell. Factories have been closing down one after another. Manufacturers are helpless, and farmers and workers are waiting to die. Unscrupulous elements are taking advantage of this opportunity to incite farmers and workers and disrupt society everywhere. If no measures are taken soon, the future will be unimaginable. The representatives will go to Beijing on December 2nd to plead for the removal of hardships and request assistance in accordance with the allocation of surplus customs revenue or silk public bonds for relief. Please also ask the National Government to promptly order the military and political leaders of Sichuan to immediately exempt silk cocoon taxes and levies, as well as the Jiangfang import fees newly levied by the 21st Army in Chongqing. Therefore, we especially request your association to forward the information to the government.' We hereby approve this. Silk cocoons are a major commodity in our country's foreign trade, and Sichuan silk also occupies an important position. In recent years, due to the harassment of taxes and levies and the boycott of Japanese silk, silk merchants and farmers and workers have been directly and indirectly affected. The impact on the national economy and people's livelihood is by no means small. In accordance with the previous letter, we hereby submit it to your government for review and verification. We earnestly request that you promptly order the exemption of taxes and levies and allocate funds for relief to maintain the industry. This is in the public interest. We respectfully submit this document." It is heard that Mr. Li and more than 10 others are scheduled to take the train to Beijing today, carrying a petition to appeal to the government authorities.</p>
<h3>Ham Industry Requests Cancellation of Inspection</h3>
<p>Reply to the Finance Bureau Letter Recently, the ham industry in this city has heard that the Health and Finance Bureaus are implementing meat inspection work and collecting an inspection fee of one yuan per hundred catties for ham, cured meat, etc. The Finance Bureau has also sent staff member Cheng Fengyun to contact the industry. The industry has already done so several times. The stores in the industry have also convened a general meeting of representatives of the industry in the city. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. The industry has now replied to the Finance Bureau with a letter from the industry association, which states: "We are responding to your Bureau's letter No. 2615, which states that the Health Bureau's letter has been approved, and it is proposed to start meat inspection work in this city and stipulate the collection of meat inspection fees upon entry into the city. After our association convened a general meeting of representatives of the industry in the city, it was proposed for discussion. Everyone agreed that the implementation of inspection of pork, beef, and mutton is a matter of health administration, and the facilities are indeed perfect. However, ham and cured meat have been carefully made and can be stored for a long time, which is different from fresh meat. Now, suddenly adding the name of inspection is intended to achieve the reality of tax collection. This move will benefit the government very little and harm the future of domestic products greatly. If it is implemented, I am afraid that the declining ham industry will be unable to withstand further destruction. Therefore, it was decided to submit a petition to the Municipal Government, requesting the cancellation of this announcement to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. In addition to our association submitting a direct petition, we are hereby replying to your letter for your consideration." (Omission)</p>

<h3>Shaanxi Disaster Urgently Needs More Soup Kitchens</h3>
<p>Report from the Jisheng Society The Chinese Jisheng Society of this port previously received a telegram from Mr. Lu He and Mr. Dai Zhenshan of the Shaanxi Xi'an Jisheng Branch, stating that the disaster in Shaanxi this winter is severe and calling for relief. Due to its financial constraints, the Society has added two more soup kitchens to the Wugong Disaster Children's Education Center. The funds were remitted by Yixingzhuang Jie Jifenghou at the end of last month, totaling 15,000 yuan. However, according to another urgent telegram from the same place, the disaster situation in Wugong is particularly serious and extremely tragic. There are many refugees, and the need for relief is urgent. Two soup kitchens are far from enough, and it is hoped that more funds can be raised to set up three more soup kitchens to avoid turning people away, it is said. The Society's financial resources are exhausted, and it is difficult to cope with the situation and has been unable to approve the request. However, the disaster victims in Shaanxi are in this freezing weather, hoping for relief. It is hoped that people in the country can spare a thought while warming themselves by the stove and generously offer assistance, it is especially hoped.</p>

<h3>European Super-Swindler's Skills Are Elusive</h3>
<p>His Demeanor Is Luxurious and His Conversation Is Elegant</p>
<p>Even the US Consulate Was Deceived by Him</p>
<p>Weilinmisen Was Cheated of 500 Gold</p>
<p>Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment Yesterday</p>
<p>European super-swindler Hai Ningsi specializes in fraud in major cities around the world. Every time he arrives in a place, he changes his name, so his names are numerous and it is quite impossible to determine his actual name. His nationality is also difficult to determine. At the beginning of last month, he arrived in Shanghai, visited the head of Xinli Foreign Firm on Nanjing Road, claiming to be a representative of the Bulanker Foreign Firm of Singapore, coming to Shanghai to purchase jewelry. The newly arrived head saw that he was generous and like a wealthy merchant, so he let him choose diamond and gold jewelry worth more than 11,000 yuan, saying that he would stay at a certain inn and pay when the funds arrived. Then he left and boarded a ship, intending to escape to Canada. On the way through Kobe, Japan, the Japanese authorities there received a telegram from Shanghai and immediately detained him. A search of his luggage revealed that the items he had defrauded were still there. The police station was telegraphed to send detectives to transfer him back to Shanghai. He confessed to the circumstances in the Special District Court. As reported in this newspaper, the police investigation revealed that in addition to defrauding Xinli Foreign Firm of jewelry, the Gelai Foreign Firm, which specializes in making and selling Western-style clothes on Nanjing Road, was also defrauded of 350 yuan in cash and valuable Western-style clothes worth more than 1,270 yuan. However, the swindling of 500 yuan in banknotes from American Weilinmisen, manager of the American-Asian Foreign Firm at 666 Sichuan Road, was even more ingenious than the swindling of Xinli, with an elusive and unpredictable outline. Before going to the American-Asian Foreign Firm, the super-swindler specially went to the US Consul General's Office to meet the person in charge of commerce. During the meeting, he claimed to be a representative of the Bietiena Foreign Firm of South Africa, sent by the firm to Shanghai to prepare for the establishment of a branch, but he needed to first understand Shanghai's economic situation and business conditions for reference. He was traveling to the Far East for the first time, and Shanghai was unfamiliar to him, so he came to seek advice. Fortunately, he was taught, so that he would not feel like a blind man riding a blind horse. The official in the office felt that he was very earnest and spoke appropriately, and did not suspect him of being a criminal. He then instructed him to visit Weilinmisen, because Wei had been in Shanghai for many years and was familiar with business conditions, and should be able to give detailed guidance. The super-swindler then went to the American-Asian Foreign Firm to visit Wei after 9 AM the next morning, stating his intention to seek advice. Although Wei met him for the first time, he could not be rude because he was introduced by the consulate and discussed Shanghai's business situation in recent years and how to develop the path. The swindler pretended to understand and wrote in his diary every time Wei talked to the key points. The pen was made of gold and he also offered Wei cigarettes from time to time. The cigarette case was also shiny gold. He only said goodbye until noon, and repeatedly said to Wei that his place was very narrow and unsuitable to stay. He now decided to move to the Huamao Hotel on Nanjing Road tomorrow morning. He originally intended to talk more, but now he wanted to go to the bank to withdraw money and had to leave. He asked Wei what time it was. Wei did not know his trick and looked at his watch and said that it was 12:10, and the bank's payment time in the morning was 12 o'clock. Now it was probably too late. The swindler then looked anxious and said to Wei that since he had decided to move tomorrow, he was short of travel expenses. Wouldn't that be ridiculed? He then took out several checkbooks from his pocket and asked Wei to lend him 500 gold temporarily, and promised to go to the bank at 9 AM the next day to withdraw the money and ask Wei to send someone to Huamao to return it. Wei thought that he was not a man to break his word and gave him the full amount. The next morning, he sent someone to the Huamao Hotel to inquire, but there was no Hai Si among the guests. In fact, he had boarded a ship and left Shanghai that day. The gold pen and gold cigarette case that he had flaunted were all items defrauded from Xinli. There was also a diamond ring that the swindler had also flaunted to Mr. Wei, saying that he had many such diamonds and intended to store them in the safe deposit box of your company. His boasting was truly laughable. Yesterday morning, Chief Zhou of the Special Court resumed the trial of the super-swindler and concluded that he had committed three counts of fraud, each punishable by two years of imprisonment, to be served concurrently for three years. The stolen goods were to be distributed to the victims.</p>
<h3>Uncle Kidnaps Nephew</h3>
<p>Three-Year-Old Child's Ordeal in Shanghai</p>
<p>Uncle Demands Extortion of Six Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>News Urgent, Child Sent Back</p>
<p>Wet Nurse Suffers Greatly</p>
<p>On the 24th of last month, a three-year-old boy, son of Kui Ronghang, resident of No. 1 Yangrenfang, Zhaozhou Road, French Concession, Nanshi, suddenly went missing. The next day, a letter arrived from the kidnappers demanding a ransom of six thousand yuan for his return, revealing he had been kidnapped. Investigation revealed that the mastermind behind the kidnapping was the victim's own maternal uncle. Fortunately, District Chief Wang of the Second District Police Station conducted a rigorous investigation, ultimately leading to the child's safe return. Due to the ongoing investigation, details could not be disclosed at the time. Now, the detailed account of the incident is explored below.</p>
<p>Son Goes Missing: Kui Rongfang, a businessman from Ningbo, 40 years old, specializing in hardware, with a modest fortune, has resided at No. 1 Yangrenfang, Zhaozhou Road, Nanshi for many years. His wife, Li, from Haimen, gave birth to a son three years ago, named Shanming. The couple cherished him dearly. However, on the afternoon of the 24th of last month, at 3:00 PM, Shanming suddenly disappeared. After searching everywhere without success, they reported the incident to the Second District Police Station around 6:00 PM that evening, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>Wet Nurse Detained: After receiving the report, District Chief Wang immediately personally supervised Patrol Officer Niu Yunfang, Detective Cao Junda, and others to investigate the scene. The parents stated that their son Shanming had recently been cared for by a wet nurse named Xi Lin, but due to disagreements, she was dismissed on that very day (the 24th). Then, at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the child went missing. They suspected the wet nurse was heavily involved. After hearing this statement, District Chief Wang immediately arranged for the arrest of Ding Lin in the French Concession, bringing her in for questioning.</p>
<p>Second Investigation: After being detained, Ding Lin stated, "I (Lin speaking of herself) only worked for the Kui family for eleven days. Because the young master disliked my headscarf, I was dismissed. Besides, I left at 10:00 AM, and the young master went missing at 3:00 PM. I am a woman, I really couldn't have acted so quickly. I ask for a fair investigation," etc. After the interrogation, District Chief Wang, considering her attitude and the timeline, did not find any major suspicion. So, he instructed the detectives to intensify the investigation. Soon after, the officer reported back that, after receiving orders, he returned to the Kui residence to inquire about other relatives or neighbors who had visited that day. The mistress, Li, replied that no other strangers had come that day, only her younger brother Li Shigen, along with a tailor, came to measure for sofa covers.</p>
<p>Uncle Suspect: After the questioning, Detective Cao inquired with another maid, Chen Feng. According to her statement, when the maternal uncle (referring to Li Shigen) arrived, the young master was still playing in the living room. Soon after, Li went out the back door to urinate, and the young master followed him out. He had not been seen since then. Detective Cao, after hearing this, believed that Li was highly suspicious, while Kui's wife, Li, vehemently defended him, saying that her brother Shigen was honest and would never commit such an act of kidnapping his nephew. Cao then returned to the station to report, while closely monitoring the investigation.</p>
<p>Six Thousand Yuan Demand: The next day, Kui Rongfang came to the station again to report that he had received a letter from the kidnappers demanding a ransom of six thousand yuan within a week. The meeting point was to be in Nantong. District Chief Wang thoroughly reviewed the information. Considering that Li Shigen was from Haimen and corroborating it with the maid Chen Feng's statement, there were clues to be found. He immediately secretly ordered detectives to arrest Li. As expected, at 9:00 PM on the 25th, Li was arrested in front of the Continental Hotel on Avenue Edward VII and brought to the station for strict interrogation.</p>
<p>Unemployment and Hardship: Li confessed that he was 23 years old, from Haimen. He used to work as a waiter at the Continental Hotel, but when the Continental ceased operations, he became unemployed. However, he still temporarily resided in the Continental. At the time, I (Li referring to himself) thought that if things continued like this, it would never end. So, I gathered twenty yuan at home and borrowed fifteen yuan from my brother-in-law (referring to Kui Ronghang), totaling thirty-five yuan. I planned to start a fruit business with my uncle, someone named Jia. At the time, Jia and another Xu went to Haimen to raise capital of forty yuan. Unexpectedly, all of it was stolen by Xu. Jia lost hope and returned to Shanghai with me.</p>
<p>Kidnapping Account: At that time, Jia proposed kidnapping my nephew Shanming to extort ransom as business capital. I immediately refused, as he was my own nephew and my sister and brother-in-law treated me very well. Jia said it didn't matter, he didn't need me to do anything, he had a way. After agreeing, Jia went to Haimen again, bringing his relatives, a certain couple surnamed Mou, to Shanghai. After arriving at a hotel in the Sixteen Arches, on the 24th, I went with Jia to the Kui residence. Jia waited outside, and I and a tailor went inside to measure the sofa. Later, I turned and went out the back door. Jia saw my nephew following me out and directly carried him to the Sixteen Arches, handing him over to the Mou couple, who took a boat to Tongzhou overnight.</p>
<p>Inside and Outside Collaboration: That night, I was afraid that my sister would be anxious, so I chased after Jia once. He said it would be fine, if this was successful, each person would have two thousand yuan. For example, if the ransom was six thousand yuan, Jia, Mou, and I would each get two thousand yuan. That's why I saw Jia writing the ransom note. The meeting point was at the Youfei Hotel in Tongzhou. When my sister and brother-in-law came to negotiate, they would definitely ask me to come with them, and they would make me the representative, to coordinate inside and outside, so that the goal would be achieved. This was all because I was foolish for a moment, I beg for forgiveness, etc.</p>
<p>Child Returned: After receiving the confession, District Chief Wang completely understood the facts. He immediately ordered Foreman Cao to lead detectives Wang Shuangxi, Cao Fufa, Tang Genquan, Wang Tinggen, etc., along with the victim's family and the criminal Li, to rush to Haimen overnight. They boarded a boat at 8:00 PM that night and arrived at Chunlonggang the next morning. They took a train to the Third Textile Factory and hired two cars, driving to Dongxing Town. They then transferred to Qiyang Town, to the Tenth District Office, where they searched Mou's house near the East Sea with the Bao Wei Tuan, but found nothing. According to the villagers, the Mou couple had taken the child (the victim) to Town No. 2. They arrived at Town No. 2 to inquire, but there was no such person. Later, according to a Jiang, the Mou had taken the child back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Safe Return: Seeing that there was no way to catch them, the detectives returned along the original route. Unexpectedly, the day after the detectives were dispatched to rescue the child, the kidnappers, due to the overly aggressive pursuit and unable to extort the ransom, asked a friend named Li Laoyun to return the victim to the victim's maternal grandfather, Li Gangcai, who then brought him home. The family urgently reported to the Second District Police Station. District Chief Wang immediately telegraphed the officers to quickly return to the station, while continuing to pursue the remaining criminals and reporting to the Bureau Chief for further action.</p>
<h3>Shocking News of a Filial Son Harming His Father</h3>
<p>Cheng Gengsheng Throws Lime Into Father's Eyes</p>
<p>Tao Zhaodi Injured by Poisonous Water</p>
<p>Cheng Changfu, a man from Xuzhou who lives in a flat in the Lime Kiln, Xiaoshadu, West Shanghai, is already fifty years old. He has been running a stall for old goods and sundries. His wife, Sha, is about the same age. They have a son named Gengsheng, who is now nineteen years old and well-built. He used to assist his father in the business, but in recent years he has been wandering around, associating with hooligans. Recently, Gengsheng was extremely resentful because his father had a little savings but did not think of getting him married. Unexpectedly, his father not only did not think of marrying a wife for his son, but he was obsessed with women. In May of this year, he married a concubine named Tao Zhaodi through a matchmaker. She is twenty-six years old and has a beautiful appearance. She is quite favored by Cheng. So Gengsheng resented the concubine and hated his father even more. He often avoided his father and cursed the concubine. Zhaodi, relying on Cheng's love, also frequently made slanderous remarks, saying that Gengsheng was frivolous and dared to flirt with her, and even wanted to make advances. He should be severely rebuked. Cheng, hearing this, was furious and unable to distinguish right from wrong. On the evening of the 25th of last month, just as Gengsheng returned home, Cheng beat Gengsheng severely and threw him out of the house, ordering him never to come home again. Gengsheng suffered this unjust injustice and was filled with anger, vowing revenge. Cheng and Zhaodi were on guard day and night. Five days passed, and Cheng thought that his son would never have such courage, so he gradually forgot about it. Unexpectedly, at about 7:00 PM on the afternoon before yesterday, Cheng and his beloved concubine Zhaodi were sitting down for dinner when his son Gengsheng suddenly rushed in. First, he threw a handful of lime at his father's head and face. Then, he poured a bottle of poisonous water held in his hand on Zhaodi's face. Fortunately, Zhaodi stood up and dodged, and was splashed on her legs and feet. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, Gengsheng calmly fled. His father's eyes were closed and unable to open due to the lime. Zhaodi was in extreme pain and fainted. After a long time, Cheng was finally able to open his eyes. Seeing that Zhaodi had been harmed, he hired a car and sent her to the hospital for treatment. Because the poison was very strong, the flesh on her legs was blurred, and the situation was very serious. Cheng was extremely worried and angry. He wanted to arrest his son and send him to the authorities for investigation, but he had already fled without a trace.</p>
<h3>Young Thief Apprehended in China Public School</h3>
<p>He Qiyu or Fan Moumou?</p>
<p>Dropped Out of School to Become a Thief</p>
<p>The faculty, staff, and students of China Public School in Paotai Bay, Wusong, total more than 1,500 people. Therefore, even though they are in the same school, some do not recognize each other, which leads to some people posing as students, sneaking into the school, and taking the opportunity to steal. Recently, many items such as coats, suits, watches, and books have been stolen from dormitories No. 7, 15, 20, 25, and 35 in the Huangzi building. A report was immediately made to the Seventh District Police Station. District Chief Yang sent plainclothes officers to the school for a secret investigation. At about 10:00 AM on the morning before yesterday, all the students were in class. The plainclothes officers saw a young man in a suit and leather shoes, wearing glasses, wandering around in front of dormitory No. 15. The officers were suspicious and stepped forward to observe his movements. Unexpectedly, the young man realized that he was in trouble and turned to leave the school. The officers stepped forward and arrested him. The students in the school identified that the scarf and books on the young man were all items stolen from the students. The young man was brought back to the Seventh District for questioning. He confessed that his name was He Qi, 20 years old, from Qingpu. He used to study at a middle school in the French Concession of Shanghai, but he has now dropped out of school. He came to Song to pose as a student and steal clothes and miscellaneous items from the school. In addition, a seal was found on his body, with the inscription "Fan Zhicheng." Also, according to a student from China Public School, the young man's real name is Fan Changyan, and his family is quite wealthy. It is not known why he committed theft.</p>
<h3>Lin Xuehuai Demands Clothes From Hu Die</h3>
<p>Movie star Hu Die and her fiance Lin Xuehuai have engaged lawyers Zhan Jifeng, E Sen, and Ni Wei Ou to handle the issue of their engagement termination. This has been reported in the newspaper. It is now known that Lin Xuehuai has responded to Hu Die's letter, entrusting lawyer E to submit a reply. The letter is found as follows: To the addressee: I have just received a letter from your lawyer representing Miss Hu Die, and immediately forwarded it to my client, Mr. Lin Xuehuai. He states that what Miss Hu said is not true. As for the Hu Die Company's goods, Miss Hu can collect them by presenting the signature slip that she signed when she picked up the goods. Other than this, I have no other economic entanglements with Miss Hu. How can she make such an unconscious demand without any basis? Please, your lawyers, promptly refute and urge a speedy engagement termination with me. At the same time, please return the wedding ring and the clothes and parts I left in her home. If the matter is delayed again and publicity is used to damage my reputation, I will definitely file a lawsuit according to law.

He and his wife, Shen, rushed to Li's house at about 3:00 PM yesterday to negotiate with Li. The two sides disagreed and started fighting. Li also did not show weakness. He suddenly took a sharp axe from under the stove and chopped his wife's younger brother, Chen Jinsheng, violently in the head. Chen was injured and bled profusely. He fainted and fell to the ground in extreme pain.

<p>Jiang Jinsheng Dies a Tragic Death</p>
<p>Jiang Yonglin, who lives at No. 1253 Xian Road, Hongkou, reported that his son Jinsheng suddenly suffered from abdominal pain on the 24th of last month. Jiang then called for doctors to treat him, but none were effective. A friend of Jiang, Jia, introduced Guo Yinxuan (60 years old), a man from Henan who lives at No. 57 Yiheli, Huaji Road, to treat him once. On the morning of the 29th, at 8:00 AM, Jiang went to invite Guo again. Guo went and pricked Jinsheng with a needle. Sixty minutes later, Jinsheng died. Jiang immediately reported this to the Hongkou Concession Police, ordering detectives to arrest Guo and carry the body to the corpse examination office on Avenue Foch. Yesterday morning, Guo was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the facts of the case, saying that the defendant used a two-inch-long needle and pricked the deceased four inches above his navel. Unexpectedly, he died within ten minutes. The police found that the defendant had no medical knowledge, but only relied on the method taught by his father. He had never registered. The police are now prosecuting him for the crime of negligent homicide under Article 291 of the Criminal Law and ask the court to reschedule the hearing after the autopsy. Questioned, the defendant confessed that the deceased was suffering from apoplexy aphonia. I said it was very dangerous, but I pricked him with a needle, thinking to save him, but it was hopeless. Judge Feng Shide verified the confession and ordered that he be detained for a rescheduled hearing. At 11:00 AM, Prosecutor Xu Mei arrived at the corpse examination office. The examination showed that the death was caused by the needle prick. The corpse was ordered to be claimed by the deceased's father, Jiang Yonglin, for burial.</p>

<h3>Lu Songga, a Clerk at the Jiaotong Bank, Speculates and Loses a Huge Amount of Money</h3>
<p>Amounting to as much as 25,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Assets Sold to Repay the Debt are Insufficient</p>
<p>Lu Songga, a man from Huzhou, worked at the Jiaotong Bank in Shanghai. His initial monthly salary was only 36 yuan, but it gradually increased. In April of this year, he was transferred to the first branch on Jingansi Road, and his monthly salary was already 72 yuan. Recently, the president of the bank found out that he was not doing his job well, so he was removed from his position as branch clerk and transferred back to the headquarters. The handover was originally scheduled for yesterday. Lu was panicked when he heard the news because he had been a clerk for only seven months. He had been speculating and trading, and had failed repeatedly. He had misappropriated 25,000 yuan from the accounts. If he was discovered by the new clerk during the handover, it would be even more embarrassing. Therefore, he told the president about it the day before, and was reported to the Xinzha Police Station and arrested. Yesterday, he was taken to the Local Court of the Special District. Tu Gongkuan, the director of the foreign affairs department of the Jiaotong Bank, appeared in court and said that the accounts had not yet been checked. The amount owed by the defendant might be more than 25,000 yuan, so he requested a rescheduling for detailed verification. Lu confessed that his family had already sold assets for 1,500 yuan yesterday and paid it back first. Judge Wu ordered the defendant to be detained and rescheduled for a further hearing.</p>

<h3>Tram and Car Collide</h3>
<p>A tram of a certain number on Route 1 of the Shanghai Huashang Tram Company was traveling south from the north at about 7:00 PM the night before last. When it reached Wanyu Wharf, a car of a certain number on Route 1 of the Public Car Company was also traveling nearby. The car's engine suddenly broke down, causing it to stop on the side of the road and could not be driven. At that time, Jin Runqiu, a ticket vendor from Wenzhou, No. 51 on the car, ordered the passengers on the car to get off. Later, he and the driver pushed the car to the north. Chen Yongcai, a driver from Zhenjiang, No. 28 on the tram, saw the car coming from the front. He didn't know that the car's engine was broken and expected that it would be able to give way. So he advanced slowly. Unexpectedly, the car staff also did not guard against the tram coming from the front. Therefore, they were still pushing forward vigorously. Inadvertently, they collided. With a loud noise, both cars were damaged. Jin Runqiu was knocked to the ground and his right foot was crushed when the car went backwards. Li Guangting, a guard from Post 15 on the car, heard the news and rushed to the scene. In addition to sending the injured person to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, he took Chen back to the First Section of the First District. After the chief of the section conducted a preliminary trial, he ordered that a written report be prepared and transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for interrogation.</p>

The chairman reported that some conditions had not been agreed upon during the resumption of work, such as severance pay and annual bonuses, but the company had agreed to provide them after mediation by Du Yuesheng and Gao Chao, and the following measures were proposed: (1) Annual bonus: Workers who have worked for more than six months but less than one year will receive one-fourth of their monthly salary (i.e., 25% of their monthly salary); those who have worked for more than one year but less than two years will receive one-half of their monthly salary (i.e., half a month's salary); those who have worked for more than two years but less than four years will receive three-quarters of their monthly salary (i.e., 75% of their monthly salary); those who have worked for more than four years will receive one month's salary. (2) Severance pay and retirement pay: Workers who have worked for more than five years will receive three months' salary, and the amount will be calculated based on this standard (the amount for those injured or killed on duty will be discussed separately). For those who retire due to old age or illness, or who resign on their own, the retirement pay will be handled in the same way as severance pay. Those who resign on their own without reason will not receive this retirement pay. The chairman then asked for discussion, but it was decided that these conditions, which concern the masses, could not be resolved at today's temporary meeting and that a general meeting of all group leaders would have to be convened to resolve them. It was decided to convene a general meeting of all group leaders this Wednesday, December 3.</p>
<p>South Goods Workers' Union: The seventh council of directors and supervisors was sworn in yesterday. Ling Baode, Cheng Wenhui, Tan Kesheng, Cheng Falin, Mei Lanqing, and Hu Xiaoxi attended. Yan Daoyi, Yan Wangping, Zhou Shunfa, Yu Yaoqiu, Xu Zhixian, Cai Yongxiu, Sun Chunshan, Li Qianli, and Hu Baoyuan were absent due to illness or other reasons. Comrade Zhong Quan, a representative of the Municipal Workers' Training Association, was invited to provide guidance. Because the union's affairs were important, it was decided that those who attended today would be sworn in first, and the remaining directors and supervisors would be sworn in later. Under the guidance of the superiors, the directors and supervisors who attended were sworn in at any time. The oath was administered by Comrade Zhong Quan, a representative of the Municipal Workers' Training Association. After the ceremony, a meeting of the directors and supervisors was held. Due to insufficient numbers, temporary positions were tentatively assigned to each department: (1) Ling Baode was appointed as executive director. (2) Mei Lanqing was appointed as general affairs officer. (3) Hu Xiaoxi was appointed as organization officer. Because Hu Xiaoxi firmly declined to take the position, the current situation was temporarily maintained until the remaining directors took office, and then the positions would be redistributed. (4) The accountant position was temporarily suspended. (5) The economic and custody responsibilities were temporarily assigned to the general affairs department, and the responsibilities would be transferred as soon as a candidate was selected.

(2) Regarding how to deal with the small number of workers who have not received their membership certificates or who have received them but have not paid their membership fees, it was decided to send a warning letter. If they continue to delay, their membership should be revoked.

(4) Regarding whether the binding workers of the union should continue to work now that the printing presses have started up, it was decided to send a letter to the Bookbinding Association, informing the masters to have all the old workers start work and not to add new workers who have not joined the union in order to avoid disputes. (5) Regarding how to determine the treatment conditions for workers by the masters as the New Year approaches, it was decided to reserve the matter. The meeting then adjourned.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>Son: Mommy, the New Year is coming soon. Tell Daddy to buy me a new foreign doll.</p>
<p>Mother: Your foreign doll is still good. Why do you want to buy a new one?</p>
<p>Son: Mommy, then I'm still good too. Why did you give birth to a new little brother?</p>
<p>Woman: Do you think eating at a table with thirteen people is an unlucky omen?</p>
<p>Man: Yes. I think it's a very unlucky thing. Once I was eating at a relative's house. There were exactly thirteen people at the table. Next to me sat a beautiful girl.</p>
<p>Woman: And then she died?</p>
<p>Man: No. I married her.</p>
<p>Chicken Seller: Sir, this chicken is the fattest and strongest. Buy it.</p>
<p>Customer: How much?</p>
<p>Chicken Seller: Just one dollar. Do you think it's cheap?</p>
<p>Customer (looks at the chicken carefully for a long time): Hmm. This chicken only has one eye. It's not worth a dollar.</p>
<p>Chicken Seller: No. It's just that this animal is very smart. Its other eye is winking at me, saying that the price is too low and telling me not to sell it to you.</p>
<p>Man: (Speaking to his lover on the phone) Hello. Is this Miss B?</p>
<p>Woman: Yes.</p>
<p>Man: I have a very important question to ask you.</p>

<p>Man: Miss B, I beg you. Will you marry me?</p>
<p>Woman: Wait. Who are you?</p>
<h3>Admirable Children Deferring Inheritance Money for Public Welfare</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Recently, I read four poems of lament by my teacher, Mr. Hu Shiyu. I was shocked to learn of the passing of his wife, Madam Cao. The fourth poem mentions using the inheritance money to build a bridge. I immediately wrote a letter of condolence to my teacher and asked about the bridge-building initiative. I received a reply stating that Madam Cao left behind more than a thousand dollars in assets. All of the elder brothers did not want to take their share and deferred to their younger sister. The younger sister also did not want to have it all to herself. She said that she had heard her mother say that the Hekengwan Bridge in Zhenbei had been broken for many years, and that the villagers had to take detours, which was very inconvenient. She had wanted to raise money to rebuild it. Now, she would use this inheritance money to build the bridge alone to fulfill her mother's wish. Wouldn't that be good? My teacher and all the elder brothers agreed to this proposal. It is said that it has been reported to the district office and is scheduled to be built in the spring. This shows the family education of my teacher Mr. Shiyu and his wife Madam Cao. The fourth poem of lament by Mr. Hu is recorded below. I once asked you, why do you make yourself suffer so much? You are more diligent than the servants, and more frugal than the poor. You said that you are grieving for all living beings, and who can drive away all the warmth? If you can restrain yourself, you can make a small contribution to others. Now I examine the inheritance left behind, a small amount of property is slightly stored. The daughter cherishes her mother deeply and cannot bear to take it privately. The dilapidated bridge is to be rebuilt, as I once heard you say. The inheritance money should be used for this purpose, to provide relief forever. The rushing Hekengwan River, to cross it is an obstacle. The bridge has been broken for thirty years, and today it should be rebuilt. We will entrust the rural district to supervise the construction and report to the county government. This will fulfill your wish and not seek fame for thousands of years.</p>
<h3>Miss Xiao's Actions</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Miss Xiao of Yixing. Her heroism surpasses any woman. Alone she sails ten thousand miles. Her ambition is for education. Smiling, she bids farewell to her village. Generously, she leaves Shanghai. The wind blows through her hair. The waves stretch out green for ten thousand acres. One might think she is ascending to the immortals. Facing the river, one gazes into the distance. Only concerned about the fleeting moment, she opens her trunk and cuts silk brocade. In her secluded chamber, she sorts needle and thread. This is how she guards her solitude. How could it be that in the vast sea, jackals and tigers rise to covet and pursue? Slowly, the fox becomes a demon. Angrily, humans turn into beasts. Fierce is the might of wild beasts. Ardent is Miss Xiao's blood. Alarmed, the Sea God trembles. Sad, the spirits and ghosts wail. In an instant, a thousand dangers materialize. With difficulty, her innocence is preserved. One beast staggers away. Another beast pounces again. Before long, they arrive, tail to mouth. Hesitating, they repeat this three times. Sharpening their teeth and grinding their fangs, they think to fill their bellies. Perhaps she has a way to avoid them, but they ultimately fail to achieve their desire. One must know that when resistance is firm, danger also draws near. At the end of her wits, a cry rings out, more frenzied than a mad badger. Truly, the space of a mat is like a secret demon cave. A long howl meets no echo. Her fellow passengers lie prostrate like mice. Alas, this frail woman is like meat on a chopping board. Though she has a heart to kill the enemy, she has no sharp arrows to defend herself. The distinction between human and beast hangs by a thread. Death is preferable to dishonor. A heartbreak potion sits on her bedside. Why not consume it with courage? Suicide is better than being killed by the enemy. Even the enemy's courage will falter. How valiant is Miss Xiao's heart. Her steadfastness is for the Chinese people. A thread of breath hangs unbroken, relying on the continuation of righteous spirit. Sprinkling snow falls upon us, her blood-written letter is offered for reading. One reading tears the heart. A second reading makes the hair stand on end. A letter is sent to question and reproach. Perhaps they know they are in the wrong. We lament the world today, where right and wrong depend on strength. Instead of mourning Miss Xiao, people slander her insanity. Some have even lost their minds, viewing the beasts as familiar. Buzzing like flies and groveling like dogs, they each enjoy their pleasure. A few lines of telegram echo faintly in an empty valley. Negotiations are unofficial, how can one fight with bare hands? Ten thousand miles of injustice bring laughter, the spirit of the Chinese people is exhausted. Such national shame is treated with indifference. Ask who has no wife or daughter, how would they feel if they suffered the same? We are all people of the same country, why divide ourselves into different territories? Alarming sand scatters with the wind, our humiliation is perhaps not yet complete. Hundreds of millions of female compatriots are available to be trampled on. In the future, they will be subjected to unrestrained lewdness. Why wait until then to predict this? Thinking of this misery, I am speechless, and tears of blood burst forth. Do not mourn Miss Xiao, rather weep for China.</p>
<h3>The First Gramophone Record</h3>
<p>— Qiushui</p>
<p>The first gramophone made by Edison of America has recently been lent to the Science Museum in South Kensington, England, for public display and viewing. The machine weighs one hundred and fifty-six pounds and has only one record. Its structure is complex and its style is clumsy, which is quite laughable. However, at that time, Edison spent a lot of time and went through many failures before he could make it, which is also a rare achievement. The world's first record has only two lines of English song. Now I will translate it. The song says: (Mary had a little lamb, whose fleece was white as snow.) Also, when this record was played, in addition to Edison himself, there was also an Englishman named Henry Attmore in the audience. It is now said that this machine and the record have been given to this gentleman as a permanent memento.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the West Palace</h3>
<p>— Fang Zifeng</p>
<p>The girls' dormitory of Great China University is called the West Palace. I have heard of its name for a long time, but I have always been troubled by its high walls and strict guards. I could not enter. Yesterday, I went to the school for something, and it happened to be the day when the West Palace was open to the public. The guards did not stop me. It was a rare opportunity. So I asked Professor Ma Gongyu of the school to guide me and tour the entire palace. After much joy, I will describe one or two things to record my feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>The West Palace is named (Qunyingzhai). It is the southernmost of the school buildings of Great China University. It seems to be the South Palace. However, from the perspective of the entire Shanghai, it is located due west. There is a small river in front of the palace, like a moat. A plank bridge leads to it. Ancient trees are lush and the scenery is secluded and beautiful. The palace is a three-story Western-style building. The style is novel and the equipment is perfect. It is the best girls' dormitory in Shanghai schools. The north side is the main entrance. There is a stone tablet next to the gate, recording the year of construction and the surname of the builder. It was written by Mr. Ma Gongyu. Entering the door, the central room is the guest hall. The curtains are lowered and the layout is elegant and beautiful. On the left and right are the bedrooms. Each room has two couches, two desks and two stools. They are all made of iron. There is a small cabinet in the corner of the room, which can be used to store boxes, clothes and shoes. Therefore, there are no sundries in the room, and it is exceptionally clean. The placement of the beds, the arrangement of the desks, and the decoration of the windows and walls are all different. Therefore, the personality of each resident can be glimpsed. Some make exquisite paper curtains to decorate the windows, and some draw ingenious paintings to decorate the walls. Then you know that the person must be rich in artistic talent. Some rooms are full of ancient books, then you know that the person must be fond of studying Chinese classics. Some walls are full of nude photos, then you know that they must be admirers of curvilinear beauty. Some use grease, powder, perfume, etc. to arrange the desks, then you know that they must be masters of makeup. Some offer melon seeds and fruits to guests, then you know that their social skills are superb. There are also rooms that do not use any decoration, and there is nothing on the desk except the books to be used. Then they must be simple people. There is only one room that has everything that is in a bridal chamber: a mandarin duck pillow, a mandarin duck quilt, a silver bottle, a makeup box, and embroidered curtains. It is undoubtedly the room of a newlywed bride. It is truly a unique feature to have this in the palace. Unfortunately, most of the residents were away on this day. It was a pity that I could not personally see their faces. The decoration of the rooms on the third floor is the most beautiful. I don't know if it is because they are occupied by students of higher grades. After the tour, I was about to leave the palace gate when a resident hurried past the courtyard, with a worried expression. She told her companion, "Three photos have disappeared." We were also unhappy when we heard this. It is said that there were many different kinds of visitors that day. Some secretly took away the beautiful photos on the walls and the perfumes and handkerchiefs on the desks. It was really too disappointing.</p>
<h3>A Raft of Cowhide in the Hetao Area</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>On the way back south from Gansu, entering Shaanxi via Tongguan, the mountains are stacked upon each other, and thorns are everywhere, and the itinerary is relatively slow. Starting from Ningxia and taking the route through Wuyuan, you can go down the river in the Hetao area, but the road is not peaceful, and the journey is also painful. Northwest transportation is inconvenient and urgently needs to be developed. My friend Mr. Lu, who returned from Gansu earlier, met me during the banquet, describing the danger of my trip, and the cowhide raft in the Hetao area is even more worthy of a record. Therefore, I will tell the readers about it.</p>
<p>The water route from Ningxia to Wuyuan must pass through the Hetao area. The water of the Yellow River is extremely turbulent, and the banks are covered with sand and rocks, which are terrifying. Ordinary boats cannot be driven if they hit a reef. Therefore, merchants generally use wooden rafts for cargo transportation. The rafts are very large, and there are many places where tents can be set up. They hollow out several entire cows, take their skins, fill them with soft grass, and tie them down to form a raft, hence the name cowhide raft. The cowhide is strong, and the surface is smooth when it enters the water, and it is not easily damaged. When flowing downstream with the water, even if there are many obstacles of sand and stones, it can slide smoothly to avoid being stranded. This method of water transportation using cowhide is probably unique to the Hetao area, and it is rarely seen elsewhere. When Mr. Lu traveled, it happened to be winter. He heard that there were many bandits along the coast, so he asked several security guards to accompany him. He was also worried that it would be easy to attract attention during the day, so he often drove at dusk and at night. He slept in the dark with the curtains closed. He often heard gunshots on the shore, or shouts wanting to inspect. The boatmen instructed him not to speak. Fortunately, in a blink of an eye, the cowhide raft had drifted away with the waves and escaped from danger. When he arrived in Wuyuan, his heart was relieved.</p>
<h3>Travels in Southeast Asia (88)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>We were discussing bird nature when suddenly there was a bang, which was the lion's roar. The sound shook, and people had the feeling of mountains ringing in valleys. Wolves howled, foxes cried, dogs barked, and monkeys screamed. I thought that the sound was probably due to the terror and misery of hearing the lion's roar. The Buddha often speaks of the lion's roar, and now I have learned it. The lion's roar makes all beasts tremble, but the tiger stays silent and still beside the lion. The lion is truly the king of beasts. But the lion's usual attitude is extremely quiet, more so than the tiger. From the perspective of the animal kingdom, animal nature comes from bird nature, and those who call themselves human beings are the enemies of all things and the king of all evils, even more than beasts. Is human nature good?</p>
<p>An Indian drove an elephant pulling a cart and passed by. It was the first time I had seen it in my life. I heard that the place with the most elephants is Sri Lanka, where they gather in groups of thousands. It is said that this animal is the largest animal on land in the world and can be called the elephant emperor.</p>
<p>July 3rd. Visited the Burmese lawyer Saw Hea Pru. Mr. Su once said that he would hold a world Buddhist conference in Burma. Mr. Su introduced several Burmese lawyers, but Lawyer Zheng Yuanfu said that all lawyers only know the present and rarely study philosophy, so they have little creativity. According to people, the knowledge of Burmese monks is above average. There are often monks who can speak English. In the future, the progress of the Burmese people will still depend on the monks. The power of school education in various villages is still in the hands of the monks.</p>
<p>4th, went to Zeng Guangweng's place with the Dharma Master to see the Tripitaka. The place is at Leopard Rabbit Station. The car ride takes about twenty minutes. There is a catalog of English Tripitaka compiled by Japanese man Tomo Ogiwara. His work is not small. Also, I have seen that the Japanese have scientific methods for researching everything. So far, China's Buddhism has contributed nothing to the domestic society and nothing to the world, because most of those who study Buddhism are followers of the old school, and few are knowledgeable in Western learning. I heard that Japan has made a great contribution to spreading Buddhism in the United States. Although Yangon is a Burmese Buddhist area, not many Chinese people believe in Buddhism. Even if they do, they rarely study it deeply. I still don’t know that there are temples and Buddhist associations in Singapore. There is a research institute in Penang, but there are no temples in Yangon. There seemed to be Buddhist associations before, but even though Gao Wanbang had the name, it disappeared after he died. Zeng has a Tripitaka for everyone to see. It can be viewed in the morning and afternoon. When I was in various parts of Southeast Asia, I saw small booklets of English Buddhist scriptures. There is also a European Buddhist youth association in Yangon. Japanese people also participate, but there are no Chinese or Burmese people. It is strange. Why do Chinese people not seek in-depth study in everything?</p>
<h3>Warmth on My Heart (326)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Miss Cuixiu Eagerly Asks the Teacher for Words, The Female Hero Generously Discusses Military Affairs at the Brothel Banquet</p>
<p>Lin Fanzhi said that there are many reasons for gaining weight, but lack of exercise is indeed a major reason. In addition, diet also plays a big role. For example, eating more meat and eating more sugary foods are also causes of obesity. Ling Zhixiang's weight gain is probably due to drinking too much beer. It is said that drinking too much beer will make people gain weight, especially the belly will get bigger. Isn't German beer the most famous? So you see, there are many fat people among the Germans, and many of them have big bellies. Ling Zhixiang often interacts with Germans and drinks that kind of beer, plus he doesn't exercise much and doesn't walk much, so naturally he gains weight. Ling Zhixiang said that no one can say who. This bulk is gradually achieved. Ordinary people slowly gain weight after the age of forty. Some people gain weight after the age of thirty. It's a bit inappropriate for someone like me to gain weight too early at the age of thirty. I think Shi Chen will also become a big bulk in the future. Zuo Shichen said, "That's strange. Of all the people here, I happen to be the thinnest. Although Haoran is short, he is a small-sized bulk. Why do you single me out as a future bulk among so many people?" Ling Zhixiang said, "There is something to be said for this. First, although you are very thin now, your face is not very thin. And your cheeks are still very full. This is a model for gaining weight in the future. Second, you are a writer. We who are engaged in other professions still run around and never stop. You are sitting in a city of books, which can be considered the group that exercises the least among those who exercise the least. Don't you say that lack of exercise is the cause of obesity? Third, according to your temperament, you will also gain weight in the future." Zuo Shichen said, "I don't believe that. What is the relationship between temperament and weight gain?" Ling Zhixiang said, "What is the relationship? There is a big relationship! Many people frown all day long. Judging from their situation, they don't need to worry so much. But they seem to be worried. That kind of person will only lose weight. I remember the ancients had a saying, 'A broad mind makes the body fat.' I think you have a peaceful heart and are open to everything. I have never seen you get angry, and I have never heard you raise your voice. No matter what urgent matters you have, you are still the same. It can be seen that you are open to everything and are not willing to compete with others. This is called a broad mind. A broad mind naturally makes the body fat." Lin Fanzhi said, "What you said is not bad. You have also said about Shichen's attitude of not worrying and not being anxious. It's just that we don't know whether he will gain weight in the end. We will have to wait twenty years to see the result. What we are concerned about is the problem of eating now. Don't discuss whether the belly will be big in the future. The belly is already getting hungry now."</p>

<h3>Silver Dollar Auxiliary Coinage Generally Equivalent</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Monday, and also the end of the previous month, and because it was Sunday, all bank clearing had to be processed yesterday, so the complexity of clearing was busier than any other period, resulting in the inability to track detailed amounts. However, various market prices in the market were generally the same. Among them, only the silver discount changed slightly; otherwise, everything was the same in the morning and afternoon, indicating the market's tranquility and boredom.</p>
<p>Liwen Consolidated, Discount Slightly Tight (Foreign Li) The morning and afternoon markets were both 7 qian, 2 fen, 4 li, 3 hao, 7 hu and a half, slightly better than the previous day's afternoon market by 1 hao and 2 hu and a half, and the situation was stable, meaning it will neither fall sharply nor rise sharply. (Silver Discount) The morning market was 1 qian and 6 fen, the afternoon market was 1 qian and 3 fen, with a surcharge of 3 to 4 fen. The bank quoted 6 fen. The silver supply is slightly tight overall because discount tickets are gradually becoming scarce and general accounts have not yet been collected.</p>
<p>Guangjiao Continues to Improve by 2 Li The market prices of Jiangnan small silver dollars and Guangdong small silver dollars were not only the same in the morning and afternoon markets, but the market situation on that day actually coincided without any changes, at 6 qian, 4 fen, and 8 li. As such, Jiangnan small silver dollars were the same as the previous day, and Guangdong small silver dollars even improved by 2 li, which can be considered a sign of rising market sentiment. There were no transactions made in Jiangjiao. Guangjiao had 65,000 jiao in the morning market and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained unchanged at 381,500 wen.</p>
<p>Foreign Funds Enter and Exit Extensively Yesterday, due to the busy bank clearing, it was not easy to interview all the usual clearing procedures. It was only heard that Qianzhuang and Yin Gong cleared more than 4.1 million yuan, and the silver surcharge was reportedly about 6 to 7 million yuan from Qianzhuang, but it is still difficult to confirm. As for ticket collection, it had already been entrusted to counterpart businesses for settlement the previous day, while disbursement was supplemented yesterday, with a huge amount that has not yet been settled. Market transactions: the morning market saw 960,000 yuan in remittance tickets, and the afternoon market saw 1,075,000 yuan. There were no transactions in banknotes in either market. Only off-market trading was better, opening at 195,000 yuan in the morning market and 150,000 yuan in the afternoon market. Bank transactions: the morning market mutual trading was 550,000 yuan, and the afternoon market mutual trading was 600,000 yuan. The clearing of foreign accounts between banks and silver surcharges were also not investigated and are omitted. Qianzhuang and Yang Gong cleared 6.45 million yuan, small Qianzhuang traded 700,000 to 800,000 yuan, and the source of guest funds is unknown.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Market Rises First, Then Falls</h3>
<p>Significant Fluctuations Before and After, Resulting in a Slight Return to Fatigue</p>
<p>Nineteen-Year Post-Reorganization Short-Term Treasury Bonds Open for Trading</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock exchange opened for trading the nineteen-year post-reorganization short-term treasury bonds, with both futures and spot goods available. Trading was particularly active. It is noted that these treasury bonds were issued on the first of last month, with a bond amount of 50 million, a monthly interest rate of 8 li, and will be repaid in 66 months. The fund is designated to be paid from increased customs revenue. Judging from the market situation, it should be able to occupy a place in the investment market. Yesterday, the futures market for other bonds remained prosperous, and the atmosphere among buyers and sellers was as lively as before, but the movement of spot goods was scarce. As for the changes in bond prices, the morning trading sessions saw continued soaring prices due to the extremely strong buying sentiment and the relationship between bonds seeking supply. Bonds such as the Whole Six, Disarmament, and Nineteen Customs all rose quite sharply. However, the market suddenly reversed in the afternoon. Due to the high bond prices, the market took the opportunity to close out positions, and selling was active. All bonds turned weak and fell sharply. Whole Six, Disarmament, and Nineteen Customs all fell significantly. Even the newly issued nineteen-year post-reorganization bonds fell several yuan compared to the previous year. As a result, compared to the previous week, bonds such as Whole Six, Reorganization, Nineteen Customs, and Disarmament each fell by 7 to 8 jiao, but others only shrank by 2 to 3 jiao. The future of the bond market is still quite good. The total daily spot trading was 6,600 yuan, and the futures trading was over 7.7 million yuan before and after, totaling over 14.7 million yuan. Bond Category, Previous Opening, Later Closing, Compared to Previous Day, Transaction Volume Whole Sixty-Two, 73.00, 72.10, Down 0.10, 1,025,000 Whole Sixty-One, 74.80, 72.15, Down 1.15, 1,260,000 Customs Duty Twelve, 63.20, 63.10, Down 0.40, 130,000 Customs Duty One, 62.40, 63.00, Down 0.50, 35,000 Reorganization Small Spot, ..., 59.50, Down 0.40, 100 Reorganization Twelve, 63.70, 63.30, Down 0., 10,105,000 Reorganization One, 13.20, 62.55, Down 0.85, 940,000 Disarmament Eleven, 77.00, 7.40, Down 0.35, 1,615,000 Disarmament One, 7.00, 7.40, Down 1.00, 1,080,000 Financial Spot, 32.80, ..., Up 0.15, 100 Financial Twelve, ..., 33.30, Unchanged, 25,000 Nine Six Two, 23.40, 33.00, Down 0.30, 550,000 Nine Six One, 23.60, 13.20, Down .35, 100,000 Rolled Twelve, 75.80, 75.60, Down .40, 220,000 Nineteen Rolled One, 74.10, ..., Down 0.37, 12,000 Nineteen Customs Spot, ..., 77.80, Down 0.92, 26,000 Nineteen Customs Small Spot, ..., 76.70, Down 1.70, ...

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Heavily Burdened and Difficult to Reverse</h3>
<p>The yarn market is almost completely depressed. Although the current yarn selling price has not changed, the bearish trend in near-month futures yarn is intensifying, and people's panic is unprecedented. After the disappointment of actual sales, there is also some kind of rumor about Wufu Muyang, causing the bulls to be apprehensive. The shorts then took advantage of the opportunity to actively add to their positions, resulting in a new low. Moreover, the distance between near and far months is even greater, further indicating that the market situation is heavily burdened and difficult to reverse. It is said that the May futures will start with Wufu as the equivalent product, and Muyang will add about 2.</p>
<p>Foreign Bids Fall Again by One or Two Taels In the foreign bids' forward market opening, shorts were active. Then, they followed the Han Biao to stabilize, but later, due to pessimistic sentiment and a lack of new buyers, they fell again. It is estimated that the front market fluctuated by one or two qian, and the rear market fell by about one or two taels, totaling 22,450 bales traded. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>February 1415, Down 14 March 1459, Down 07 January 429, 12 April 1470, 08 February 1440, 15 May 1480</p>
<p>Current Sales Trend Increasingly Stagnant Current yarn transactions are very sluggish. It is estimated that all gangs bought a total of 540 bales throughout the day. The market is flat and weak. Among the customer gangs, Hankou imported 180 bales, the mainland imported 130 bales, and miscellaneous gangs imported a total of 330 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Rises and Falls Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton market originally had a glimmer of hope for a slight recovery, but it was unexpectedly affected by the sharp decline in cotton yarn. It is reported that manufacturers recently transacted tens of thousands of futures of Indian cotton. The fear of the bulls has not yet left their minds, and the bleak market scene still shines in our eyes.</p>
<p>Han Biao Unstable The Han Biao initially rose due to the gold market and exchange rates being favorable to buyers, and shorts covered their positions. Later, it declined following the yarn market, and the situation was quite unstable. It is estimated that the front market rose by 1.5 to 2.5 qian, and the rear market fell by 1 to 2.5 qian, totaling 41,400 dan traded. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>December 3180, Up 5 March 3165, Up 5 January 3155, 5 April 3185, ... February 3160, 10 May 3195</p>
<p>Current Cotton Quiet Both current cotton arrivals and transactions are weak. However, the desire to sell held goods is relatively active, but limited to medium-grade goods and below. 450 bales of Yaohua arrived at the pier, and 198 bales of Tonghua. Transactions are as follows: Hongzhang Yarn Factory imported 10 pieces of Shaanxi cotton, priced at 34.50. Spot goods entered the factory. Tongxing Yarn Factory imported another 100 pieces, priced at 34.25. Spot goods entered the factory.</p>

<h3>British and Indian Cotton Market Weakness Continues</h3>
<p>Bombay The market situation last week was bleak, with prices falling slightly. Although exporters have some compensation, due to the pressure of new cotton arrivals, they are likely to continue to fall slightly. In terms of spot goods, there is very little real demand. Japanese merchants are purchasing Pingguo'er in Upper India for export to Europe. South Africa is also discussing Pingguo'er and Benjie cotton. China is inquiring about Aomula. The statistics for last week are appended below (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>1929 1930 Cumulative receipts from September 1st 329 286 Existing at the weekend 623 399 Cumulative exports from September 1st 350 463 Shipped to Europe 164 113 Shipped to China 21 92 Shipped to Japan 148 254 Other regions 17 4</p>
<p>Liverpool Spot demand was quiet last week. The spring futures market is still lackluster. There are not many sales, but they are all absorbed by those who buy on dips. Local and Bombay gangs have slightly purchased. Egyptian cotton is weaker due to sales by mainland merchants and unfavorable news from Alexandria.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market: South Stable, North Falls</h3>
<p>Zhabei Yesterday, there were arrivals from Luli from numbers 20 to 30, with varying sales. High-quality white geng rice remained stable, while ordinary and lower grades all fell by two jiao. The digestion of workshop stores is extremely sluggish. The top is due to the dual collection of inventory, so they maintain the original price, still opening at 14 yuan 45 jiao, but the overall trend is inevitably weakening. The arrival of Bo Dao is heavy in Yinqudaihe, with thick inventory, and the price is slightly down by about three jiao, with the top opening at 12 yuan at the pass, and the situation is quite weak. Yangxian is scarce and sales are flat, and Dujian is extremely active in retail sales, opening high at 12 yuan 9 jiao. The sales of Bujian in the port are still acceptable, and the source of Kejian is not strong, so the owners are not in a hurry to sell, so the prices of the above varieties of xian rice have not changed, and the ground is very stable. Bianyin Yuan sales are very weak, the selling sentiment has turned strong, and the price is short by two or three jiao, with the top Bian Yuan opening at 14 yuan 7 jiao.</p>
<p>South Shanghai Yesterday, not many boats arrived from the river, and the sales were not smooth. The arrival and sales of Changxi Beigeng were both weak, opening high at 14 yuan. The retail sales of Su Tong each geng are not smooth, and the report from Luli is weak, and the sentiment is not good. However, the merchants intend to sell at a slightly reduced price, and there is no increase or decrease in high-quality goods. The source of early rice from Nanbang and other types of rice is slightly weaker. At the moment, the high-quality wholesale price is only 11 yuan 67 jiao, because there are few buyers and the transaction is dull. Yangxian and Duxian can still be sold here, but the trend is still quiet and the price is not much. Bian Yuan fell slightly and Yinyuan followed, and the intentions of each vendor are not strong. The situation will follow the Zhabei market and fall, and the high Bian Yuan is勉強开 at 14 yuan 7 jiao.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Market Outlook Tightening</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian market situation, this street's appetite was very fragrant, seemingly gradually improving. Because after the cold weather, the producing area of Xiaojiugang may have ice, and the hawkers also have no energy due to the cold weather. Moreover, the government limited Jinli to close accounts at the end of the year, and money merchants could not turn around for the sake of closing, so it is expected that both Du and Ke Xian will be reduced in the future. The market sentiment is good. This is because Du rice has arrived less, especially paying attention to Ke Xian. After this, the arrival of Ke Xian will be reduced, and the market price will immediately rise. A total of 600 bags of Jiangxi machine early rice were sold, priced at 10 yuan 02 jiao, and 200 bags of machine late rice were priced at 11 yuan half. 200 bags of Hunan machine rice, priced at 10 yuan 06 jiao half. 750 bags of Nanjing machine rice, priced at 10 yuan 1 jiao half to 10 yuan, and 200 bags of Liu Cao rice, priced at 9 yuan 1 jiao, and 300 bags of Cao rice, priced at 8 yuan 8 jiao, are all handled by this street. The appetite of the customers is weak, and because of the early closing at the end of the year, they do not want to handle loading.</p>
<h3>Near-Month Flour Drops Continuously</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the market of each month presented a phenomenon of near-month falling and far-month flat. During the suspension of auctions, foreign flour and small standard flour also fell sharply, so after the opening price, the sentiment was unusually sluggish, and compared with the closing price of the previous month, it was invisibly shortened by two fen. It is better to gradually stop in order to end, and the market's lack of vibration is the biggest main reason for this. Although the spot flour of manufacturers such as Fuxin and Fufeng factories shouted 2 qian and 2 and a half, which is always one qian higher than the standard, the futures and spot are different and the situation is different, so the reduction of non-factory futures cannot be expected to improve the standard. The long-term formation of a set of heads, the selling atmosphere turned silent, the market is also stable, the May initial opening is 2 taels, 1 qian, 1 fen and 1 li half, similar to April, and there was no opening in the afternoon. As a result, this month fell 3 fen and a half compared to the end of the previous month, January fell 3 fen and 2 li half, February fell 2 fen, March fell small 2 li half, April was unchanged, and May was not comparable.</p>
<h3>Near-Term Barley Airspace Desire Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday's barley market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the market of each month presented a phenomenon of initial flatness and continued stability. Because there was no quotation for foreign barley, speculative thoughts were less effective. In the meantime, a part of the floating empty, the market fell so sharply, it seems necessary to temporarily stand, so the intention is stronger, to the general with foreign countries as the goal, first need to have the spot order, before daring to sell again, the market's slightly stable, but also non-speculative reduction. As a result, this month is 3 fen better than the previous week, January is 4 fen better, February is 3 fen better, March is 4 fen better, April is 2 fen better, May opened at 4 taels 1 qian, and the closing price is also 2 fen better. The current barley market situation is that the factories are not interested in entering, and there is no opening.</p>
<h3>Near-Term Dalian Soybeans Plunge by Eight Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's standard futures soybeans, the market situation was very soft, and the sales of each gang were very smooth. The current soybean arrival gradually turned strong, and the market in Dalian has been weakening and depressed. The market sentiment is short, and the intention of the bulls to sell has turned urgent. The near-term decline is especially sharp. The year-end use is up to 4 taels, 6 qian and 7 fen, down by more than 8 fen compared to the end of last month. The remaining months also followed by about half a qian. The closing price for the February-March futures was 4 taels, 6 qian and 4 fen, and the January-April futures was 4 taels, 6 qian and half.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Coarse Sand White Rises by One Qian</h3>
<p>Eastern Sugar Rises More Sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market received no telegrams from the producing area. The public market plan, with the rising exchange rate, the popularity is better, and the buyers are more active. The market price is gradually rising sharply. Twenty-four number coarse sand white initially shouted 7 taels and 6 qian half, the buying intention was slightly dull, and then the transaction was frequent to 7 taels and 6 qian, and the sellers were particularly lacking. The high price was 7 taels, 6 qian and half, and finely ground sand white 7 taels, 6 qian, 7 fen and half. The market situation was very outstanding, rising by one qian compared to the previous day. The 20th number medium sand white rose 6 taels and 7 qian half, and the market was not weak. The trend of Japanese sugar is even more tense, the sellers are lacking, the demand is quite strong, and the market situation is chaotic. At the beginning of the market, YRO mark was 7 taels and 1 qian, and then it rose to 7 taels and 2 qian. SH mark was 7 taels and 4 qian, N mark was 7 taels and 8 qian, TX mark was 7 taels and 7 qian half, YT mark was 7 taels and 7 qian, YP mark was 8 taels to 8 taels and 1 qian, and J mark rose to 8 taels and 3 qian, rising by two qian compared to the previous day, and the market was quite strong, still with a rising trend. The number plate had Deshenghao selling 10 bags of Binghua Qingwang, priced at 7 taels and 1 qian half. Domestically produced top ice white sugar continued to open 30 bags, priced at 10 taels and 08 qian, and high-grade hand ice opened 60 packs, priced at 5 taels and 8 qian. The market situation was stable.</p>
<h3>Seafood Seaweed Dealers Concede to Seek Delivery</h3>
<p>Seaweed's recent customer sales are quite strong. Sichuan, Han, Hunan, Jiangxi, as well as Min and Ou gangs, all have large-scale purchases. However, the new crop harvest is unusually abundant. According to the survey conducted in various producing areas, compared to the previous year, it is estimated that more than 10,000 shi have been harvested. Therefore, the source is surging, and the warehouses are full. Although the customer sales are healthy, there is still a situation of oversupply. The selling price is falling, and there is no expectation of a return. All merchants with more goods are cutting prices to try to sell. Wholesale transactions are especially willing to make special concessions. The trade side is also afraid to greedily enter due to the loosening of the dealer's price. Yesterday, the market trade side sold and兜售. Genmuro seaweed was priced at 4 taels and 9 qian, Hamanaka Houan and Sichuan routes were priced at 4 taels and 78 qian, the head of the village was priced at 4 taels and 3 qian, Guizhuang was priced at 4 taels and 4 qian, and the second and third crops were priced at 3 taels and 78 qian.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods Wood Ear Market Fell Miserably</h3>
<p>Sales Have Gradually Turned Around... or There is Hope for Recovery</p>
<p>Wood ear's recent sales have been sluggish, and the market price has gradually turned down. The previous market for miscellaneous ears was once sold for around 100 taels, but now it has fallen again and again to 90 taels. At the same time, the Hankou market has also fallen frequently, with ordinary goods falling to 82 or 83 taels. At that time, the Yue gang had directly purchased at the local area, but now the market has changed again. According to the telegram, they are urgently on the verge of breaking the 80 tael mark. However, this price still needs 93 or 4 taels, and the selling price of 90 taels here is also difficult to calculate. Each trade will cut the cost to迎合customers to迎合銷胃, so after the sharp fall, there may be a small return hope, but the upper village large Duo Fu ear Han Cun is not much, the current market price of 148 taels is still standing, can not be 松 云.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Factory Carries 25 Packages of Warp to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Purchased by Cheng and Other Factories as Raw Materials for Weaving Silk</p>

<h3>Foreign Merchants' Tea Market: Russian Sales Particularly Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tribute to green tea from the 来路庄 to the Shanghai Russian Cooperation Society was浓胃轉. For the goods that had not yet been allocated, they continued to ask prices yesterday. There are only more than 10,000 boxes left, which seems easy to sell. However, British and French merchants are watching on the sidelines for Zhenzhou Zhu tea and other items, and the transaction is increasingly sparse. The market situation is unusually pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Pingtou Dahai Tiger Velvet Sells Well, Price Rises</h3>
<p>Dahai Tiger Velvet has been doing quite well recently, and the selling price has risen accordingly. The sales field of Yuanse is especially wide. Silk and satin shops on this street and hat making workshops and four 洋服裁縫 gangs all have competitive offices. Gai Erlai women's doudou coats and new shawls are mostly used here, resulting in supply exceeding demand. Most of the existing goods have been sold out, and new goods are difficult to transport for a while. Yesterday, Hao Hua, Rongtai shouted Li Tailai and other famous brands all rose to 7 taels.</p>
<h3>Plaid Overcoat Wool in Short Supply</h3>
<p>Erlai overcoat wool sales are extremely旺, and each of the customers is still in need. There are transactions in零疋 whole boxes. The Huai price is strong and clear. Those who打棧单出貨者 are crowded every day. High-grade all-wool plaid overcoat wool is currently in short supply in the market, resulting in a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Because the weather is suddenly cold, the overcoat is now定生意, and the business has suddenly increased, and the market situation is also gradually rising because of this. The Li Feng goods have risen to 7 taels half net. Tianyou goods, wholesale only sold 6 taels and 9 qian per yard ten days ago. Brokers can still deduct commissions when reselling. Yesterday, all have risen to 7 taels and 2 qian half.</p>
<h3>Fine Cloth and Fine Twill Loosen Together</h3>
<p>The situation of the 本厂 cloth market is soft again. Because the flower yarn is not振, the end of the year will turn瞬, and the holders are求脱, so it is difficult to return to solid for a while. Yesterday, the細斜校 fell again, Yanghe sold 6 taels, 6 qian and 7 fen half, and Blue Double Fish 6 taels, 5 qian and 7 fen half, which has fallen money, is达钱. The Blue Double Fish fine cloth has now opened 6 taels and 8 qian half, and Yanghe 6 taels and 3 qian half. Only the coarse cloth is still solid, and 9-pound cloth still needs 4 taels and 3 qian. 11-pound Jump Child is because the 街 needs 孔亟 and has sold to 5 taels. Hubei goods are even more呈飛黄騰達之象, and the coarse slope has not changed much.</p>
<p>The eastern and western 疋 market still falls more and rises less. Only the eastern goods' straight tribute satin is still挺. The first work opens 3 qian and 1 fen half, the five roads 3 qian and 7 fen, and the 八骏 3 qian and 6 fen half. The lower goods also have a solid appearance. The Yue Kongque has been辦 by the Qingdao帮 very much in the past few days and now needs 2 qian and 6 fen half. The cotton method is missing, and the former has been运到, and there is no shortage. The amount of Shou Tu silk is 2 qian and 1 fen, Fuhua Yanglan is 2 qian and 7 li half, and the concubine color is 1 qian and 9 fen and 2 li half. The bald white is 1 qian and 9 fen, and the big red is 1 qian and 8 fen and 7 li half. The Shuilang velvet continues to fall. The Yuehua velvet presents a stand-up situation. The black flower velvet is more soft. The upper goods of the fine Serge are still lacking, and the spot goods of Baoqiu Ancient City Club are not many. Huxinting has gradually arrived in Shanghai. The Sezi Tribute to the Changjiang帮稍有动办 and the price is from 2 qian and 2 fen to 4 fen half. Western goods are still silent, only 放鲤直貢呢本客添办 is still thriving, and the price now needs 2 qian and 7 fen.</p>
<h3>Hardware White Lead Skin Extremely Quiet, Thinking of Moving</h3>
<p>The white lead skin market has not had a sale for a long time, so the market appearance is extremely quiet. The standard is that the market appearance is declining due to the lack of human air. It is estimated that No. 2 sells 24 taels, No. 3 sells 24 taels and 5 qian, No. 4 sells 23 taels and 5 qian, No. 5 sells 22 taels, No. 6 sells 22 taels and 7 qian half, No. 7 and No. 8 both sell 22 taels and 9 qian, No. 9 sells 22 taels and 2 qian half, No. 10 sells 21 taels and 7 qian half, and No. 11 to No. 14统卖 21 taels and 5 qian. The trade on the market yesterday, the Sichuan, Fujian and Henan gangs相率收办, so the market situation is quite quiet, thinking of moving, so the price trend is坚挺.</p>
<h3>Hardware Price Increase of One Fen</h3>
<p>In recent days, the exchange rate of iron has fallen, and the cost of imported hardware goods has invisibly increased by one fen, resulting in the industry for the current market price莫不扳守奇紧. Therefore, such as large hardware, tinplate, flat white iron, triangle iron, black iron sheet, tile bang iron, white iron plate, Huis iron, French West nails, new lead wire, new iron wire, etc. 莫不提加two half to one two pieces, etc. However, in real transactions, the export帮停办 and the manufacturers have no power to import goods due to the end of the year, so the market feels more bleak.</p>

<h3>The Shadow of Wuyou</h3>
<p>— Kang Lin</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>A leaf-like boat is light, a pair of oars startle the herons, the water and sky are clear, the reflections sink into the stream, fish turn amidst the algae, egrets perch on the sandy islet, the rapid current of Sha Creek passes, the rivers and mountains are cold, the moonlit stream is bright.</p>
<p>— One of Su Dongpo’s “Butterflies Lingering over Flowers”</p>
<p>During the long journey, I recited these lines while leaning on the ship’s railing. The green hills and clear waters before me deeply intoxicated me. The heart, shaken by the hustle and bustle of the city, found rest here.</p>
<p>To come here, I buried the joys and sorrows of the past. The ancients have already exhausted the magnificent phrases describing heroic sentiments. Although the beautiful scenery of the mountains and rivers makes my heart itch, what skill do I have with words?</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>I cannot use words to describe the beauty of the mountains and rivers, and language is an even inferior method. In my heart, I nurture all the ideas that are about to hatch, hoping that the world will arrive one day...</p>
<p>All who have leaned on the ship's railing and gazed at the Jiāzhōu landscape, praised by ancient and modern literati, are reflected, bit by bit, from the clouds and waves. (A leaf-like boat is light, a pair of oars startle the herons, the water and sky are clear.) Our eternally open-minded poet has already depicted the beauty before his eyes with his pen. On this ascent today, how can I describe the inspiration that the Jiāzhōu landscape gives? I am a mediocre commoner, only nurturing all the buds and flowers in my heart.</p>
<p>The Jiāzhōu landscape is the freshest and most beautiful among the mountains and rivers of Sichuan, imbued with poetic inspiration. If, as Keats said, the poetry of the world accompanies the universe eternally, then this place is the source of that "world poetry."</p>
<p>I have long guided my life's trajectory towards wandering, seeking to understand the beautiful dreams that cannot be found in the ordinary life from the twists and turns of life. Therefore, during several wanderings north and south, I have diligently tried to gain something from the myriad things of nature. However, the heart of a wanderer is like a restless sea tide, and what is felt is often unexpected. Therefore, the rare beauty before me cannot arouse any emotion. Now I have arrived in the embrace of the Jiāzhōu landscape. What can the famous places praised by Li Bai, Du Fu, Yuyang, and other great masters ignite in my heart?</p>
<p>During my two-month stay in Jinjiang, I was troubled by worries. The so-called Loquat Gate Lane, Du Fu's former residence, the Twelve Long Bridges, the Temple of the Prime Minister, and the banks of the Huānxī Stream, I never visited. Now, all the scenery of the northern country has been buried behind me. When will I be able to retrieve the old sights from the Black Sea? What can this bright spring landscape pour into my heart anew...?</p>
<p>I want to obtain the spiritual sustenance of the abandoned from the bright scenery here. Therefore, I drag my long-travel-weary body to enjoy the green hills and clear waters. Of course, the trembling heart flag cannot fly into the embrace of nature. If I find a single grain of gold from the gravel and rocks of the broken cliffs, the wanderer will not be so sad.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>In order to seek gold grains from the gravel and rocks, I entrust my exhausted body and mind to the small boat that has been battered by the long flowing river. The small boat sails downstream with the rapid current, and the river water returning from the side of Mount Éméi emits a feverish laugh in the turbulent green waves. The small boat also rises and falls with the tide, meeting the mountain climbers returning from their pilgrimage. In the mutual welcoming and sending off, the fatigue and worries that filled my body and mind disappeared inexplicably.</p>
<p>Looking out from the boat, I can see the famous sites downstream. The Giant Buddha Temple, Wūyóu Temple, and another mountain isolated on the water's edge are like three goddesses gazing at the riverbank. They are faintly like the misty three islands of Penglai in the sea. From afar, they look like a lush painting, concealing more poetic meaning than the green hills elsewhere. The ancients' so-called "poetry in painting" and "painting in poetry" are perhaps worthy of such praise for these three mountains.</p>
<p>The Giant Buddha is indeed a great statue. His whole body was carved from the form of the mountain by monks. It is said that his whole body is thirty or forty fathoms long, with his head level with the top of the mountain, and his feet still far from the river water. Common people are deeply afraid that the Giant Buddha will wash his feet, in which case the entire city of Jiāzhōu would be submerged in water. In June, when the Ya River and Qingyi River waters rise, the rapid currents rush straight towards the Giant Buddha Rock, and many boats are trapped and broken on the rocks. At that time, boatmen and passengers devoutly pray to the Giant Buddha to save their lives and promise to gild him. In fact, it is not easy to decorate the Buddha's head with a golden head of three or four fathoms. However, human deception and divine absurdity have stretched on for a long time. My body has now come before the Giant Buddha. I silently and foolishly gaze at the rock-carved statue. If any disaster befalls me, I may not be able to avoid making a boring salute and this deception. What can I be inspired by from him now? I just feel that this is a Buddha statue on which the foolish and blind place their fate.</p>
<p>The small boat is pushed downstream along the rocks. After passing a belt of broken cliffs, the peak of Wūyóu Temple emerges before my eyes. The fire-like red rocks, sparkling in the light, appear even redder in the golden light of the setting sun. Vines wrap around, and branches hang upside down in the heart of the mountain in a staggered manner. The verdant forest is even more towering like it is inserted into the clouds. My classmates and I look at it from afar in the boat and feel that the "beauty of Wūyóu" is exhausted here. In reality, after climbing several levels of stone steps and entering the temple gate, all the beauty is occupied by the idols alone. The saying "I cannot recognize the true face of Mount Lú, for I myself am in this mountain" can be borrowed to describe our feelings on this ascent. The inspiration felt on the river has completely disappeared in the mountain.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>For the sake of the long journey of thousands of miles, I want to savor the flavor of my hometown in my memories, and even more, I want to visit the famous sites in the hometown of the three Sū and the place where Dongpō rested and played. However, everything is disappointing. What is worth having in this society? Although this Wūyóu Temple, Dongpō Pavilion, and Giant Buddha Temple have an immortal value in cultural relics, what have we gained from them...?</p>
<p>In the busy schedule of traveling, I have no strength to explore all the legends. According to the old monk's words, I vaguely remember that "Wūyóu" is a spiritual object that protects the heart. The rest of the myths have been forgotten. Fortunately, the famous poet Zhao Xi in Sichuan wrote the two characters "Lí 離" on the stone tablet in front of the Wūyóu Temple gate, and below it is also inscribed: "(Bān Zhì 班志) dug Lí Jiāo 離嶣 to avoid the Mò River 沬水. Knowing the Mò River means knowing Lí Jiāo. Digging the Gong River 工江 in Chengdu is another matter. Rolling it will be a mistake." It is said that this mountain still has some historical status.</p>
<p>According to the mountain monk's boastful words, these two mountains occupy the first place in the water of Jiāzhōu. Later, due to the ravages of soldiers and bandits, all the beautiful scenery was turned into ruins. Recently, although they wanted to cultivate it, they have repeatedly given up due to the internal war. Therefore, when I asked if there were any records of the beautiful scenery, he could not help but be astonished.</p>
<h3>Black Skirt</h3>
<p>— Bīng Shè</p>
<p>Wūyóu Temple has more than thirty monks, and the Giant Buddha Temple is about the same. These parasites who chant scriptures day and night rely on the temple property, alms, and repentance offerings in the secluded life of famous mountains to live a very leisurely life, which is more leisurely than the vulgarity of the world. Because of the falling of life today, thinking of the monks' leisure, and because of the wandering without a foothold, I feel that this cannibalistic society still allows these deformed people to survive downwards. Life is so contradictory. I always feel that the world can never escape this category of contradiction.</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>The famous sentence of Dongpō (The great river flows eastward) is written on the gate of a certain temple. Can I sing to the end of the world today? Of course, I want to ("sing so that thousands of mountains resound, and clap my hands"). However, in the whip of life, especially leisure and elegance are not destined for wanderers, and my throat has been torn by the saws and knives of the world. Even if the mountains and rivers here can give me the great poetry and music of the world, can I revive the broken strings and play them?</p>
<p>Everything is shattered before my eyes, let this world go to darkness, let the great power of the evil current flood the whole world, all the so-called truth, beauty, goodness, love... and all the truths and wild words contained are destroyed in the darkness of reality. We are looking forward to letting all these cursed things rebuild the walls and foundations when a certain era arrives.</p>
<p>The golden light of the setting sun is reflected from the cloudy sky into the deep pool under the bright red rocks. The core of each ripple is filled with brilliance. This symbolizes the modern, fervent, and burning flames burning on the face of the old era. The reflection of the return light will soon disappear in the dawn of a certain generation. Therefore, I patiently accompany the fluttering heart flag, the inside of which is full of the light of current longing, and its journey is to guide the future. Perhaps, just like the Russian poet Nadson, I feel that I am a slave rather than a prophet, and I believe that one day, the evil god Hwapin'er will eventually be destroyed.</p>
<p>This Jiāzhōu landscape is just like the poet Dongpō's nostalgic thoughts in Chibi, ("The great river flows eastward, washing away all the romantic figures of the ages"). In the chaotic rocks collapsing and clouds breaking, and the shocking waves breaking the shore, how many heroes have been annihilated in this picturesque landscape? Now, I am not burning with nostalgic feelings in my heart, but the encounter in infinite life makes people feel a little sad. However, I am not sad. If my father's sacrifice once gave me the driving force to wander, I would like to drink this cup full of blood drops from the world.</p>
<p>(VI)</p>
<p>Friends, goodbye, all the mountains and rivers of Sichuan, goodbye, oh, goodbye to everything.</p>
<p>Struggle is life, struggle is power. The legacy of the martyrs whips my gray and decaying body, and in the dark long road, let me curse the destruction of reality, and yearn for the glory of the future.</p>
<p>Friends, goodbye, let all the tides of the past be buried, let the new world dance on the stage of the great era, the gray horse calls out in the tide, goodbye, goodbye to everything, I have straddled the saddle of the horse,</p>
<p>Goodbye to all the family mountains, goodbye to all the myriad things.</p>

<h3>Establishment of the "Era Youth Society"</h3>
<p>Since the "Era Youth Society" held its inaugural meeting at the Shùjī Primary School in the Tianhou Palace on November 23rd, the atmosphere in Shanghai's youth circles has been greatly invigorated. The society issued the following declaration yesterday:</p>
<p>The wheels of the era are constantly advancing courageously. If we do not want to be the laggards of the era, how can we allow ourselves to be complacent? We can only run forward with our era. However, in this complex world of thought, we often take the wrong path, not only becoming criminals of the era but also misleading our own lives. Therefore, while we must move forward, we must also carefully choose the path we should take. During the May Fourth Movement, there was a need for all foreign ideas to rush around and destroy the decadent old ideas. At that time, the youth had no time to choose which was the most appropriate path. As long as it could break the backward thinking of China, everything was moved to China. Now, China's objective environment is different from the past. What is needed now is how to save China from its precarious situation. The past few years of revolution have left us with no small amount of disappointment. The calls of the revolutionary masses are often subject to unexpected destruction. Many people, because of boredom, have turned to the so-called reactionary path. At the same time, communists, national statists, and others have emerged, creating a situation of disintegration in the entire youth circle after the May Fourth Movement. We are extremely saddened by the infighting among the youth. We understand the arrival of this misfortune. We want to save this crisis. We firmly believe that the only way is for us young people to rise up and work hard ourselves. We understand that the biggest key to the past rift between the youth is the inability to establish a central idea. Not only must our comrades fully understand this key, but the young people wandering at the crossroads must also have a calm and peaceful consideration. We know that the beginning of the May Fourth Movement was a patriotic movement, but how to save China, we believe that the most needed is to awaken the national consciousness of the national people, especially the youth, to have a universal feeling. We should recognize that all those who harm our nation are our enemies. Secondly, we must understand that it is our youth who should shoulder this important responsibility. We must tighten our spirits, train our knowledge and skills, and fulfill our inescapable mission. We swear to move forward on the clear path we have recognized. We know that our current weak foundation cannot provide a sufficient guarantee for our expectations, but we believe that there are not a few young people who sympathize with us. At the same time, we are confident that this final victory can be realized under our efforts. Now we start from this complicated society (Shanghai). We expect 120,000 points that the youth comrades in Shanghai will give us great help. This is our declaration.</p>
<h3>Painting Exhibition of Wang Yachen and His Wife</h3>
<p>The famous painter Wang Yachen and his wife, Rong Junli, went to Europe in the 17th year to study art. Recently, they returned to China and will hold an exhibition from the 5th to the 18th of this month at the China Society Club at No. 150, Weihaiwei Road, corner of Moore Road. They will display more than 80 landscapes from England, France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy, and more than 40 copies of representative paintings from the Renaissance to modern Europe. The exhibition will be open to the public without admission tickets. It is also reported that Mr. Wang has taken over as the dean of academic affairs of the Xinhua Art College.</p>
<h3>Xunxun Society</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>Youth Literary Group</p>
<p>This is good news.</p>
<p>There are many young writers in the various universities in Shanghai. Of course, most of them have gained considerable reputation in the domestic literary world and have contributed relatively good works to the world. However, the reason why they are today's so-called young writers completely depends on the power of their own works and the submission of articles to various large and small publications in the country. This takes a lot of hard work and struggle. Moreover, the publishing world in Shanghai is so dark. Perhaps only the suddenly emerging central publication, "Era Youth," widely accepts manuscripts from young writers. The reason why this publication has been welcomed by the majority of students is also for this reason.</p>
<p>These young writers in various universities are mostly scattered like sand and lack a solid organization. In peacetime, there is little emotional connection, and each goes their own way. Therefore, in terms of thought, there is a great danger of easily going astray. Sometimes, they even repel and envy each other. This is certainly not a good phenomenon. Since everyone is walking the path of literature and art, there should be some cooperation to seek the benefits of "attacking mistakes from other mountains." The effects achieved will also be relatively large. Because of this, these young writers who have a deep understanding of literature and art have recently organized a broad literary group called the Xunxun Society. The members of this society are mostly well-known, such as Wang Yixin and He Jiahai from Zhonggong, Li Yingqiao from Chizhi, Chen Bochui from Daxia, and Liang Shaowen from Fudan. Wang Yixin and Li Yingqiao have published many works in "Era Youth." They have always expressed enthusiastic sympathy for the nationalist literary movement. Their co-authored collection of poems, "Forget-me-not Grass," will soon be published by the United Bookstore. Among them, there are also many poems centered on nationalist ideas. The organization of this Xunxun Society has been established for some time. In order to enhance the purpose of literature and art and develop personal talents, it has been decided to publish a literary publication, named "Xunxun Monthly."</p>
<p>Their purposes are mostly the same. Therefore, the expenses for publishing this monthly magazine are entirely borne by each person. In terms of writing, each person takes it seriously, hoping to become a rising star in the pure literary publications in the country. We know that the willpower of young people is very formidable. As long as they can muster their spirits and work hard, future achievements will be considerable. Moreover, in order to enrich the content of this monthly magazine, it is said that in addition to the above gentlemen taking on the manuscripts themselves, they have specially invited famous domestic writers to contribute, such as Zhao Jingshen, Jun Guanhua, Shen Congwen, Wen Yiduo, etc. It is expected that after the publication of this monthly magazine, many powerful works will be contributed to the world. At the same time, it is also an important publication against proletarian literature.</p>
<h3>China Harmonica Association</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the China Harmonica Association has been actively progressing. Now that all the arrangements have been completed, Wang Qingxun and Liu Yin have been specially invited to be instructors. Classes are divided and taught starting on the 1st. The number of applicants is endless. Students from various universities in this city, as far as Aurora, Jiaotong, Fudan, and Jinan Universities, have joined. Recently, it has entrusted the Kaiming Bookstore on Fourth Malu in this city as an agency for registration, so that people from afar can register. The address of the association is at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road. Registration time is after 5:00 PM every day.</p>
<h3>Theft Case</h3>
<p>— Mu Zhen</p>
<p>Our school is a noble girls' middle school in Shanghai. The young ladies who come here to study are generally qualified to have a comfortable life. Therefore, there are many people who go to and from school every day by chartered cars.</p>
<p>One day in the evening, in the training office, a student with a sad face said to a kind training director, "Mr. - , my two platinum watches that were closed in the box are gone, and even the lock on the box has been broken." The training director said in shock, "Another theft case? Tut, who has come to do this shameless thing again? How big is the loss in this matter?" The student said, "The two watches are worth one hundred and eighty gold. Because they need to be repaired, they are hidden in the box and not used. Today, I opened the box to get clothes, but I knew that the lock was broken and the watch had disappeared." Director Mr. hurriedly comforted her and said, "Don't worry, I will check for you."</p>
<p>So he began to investigate. Of course, the people in the same room were all suspected. Before the director said he wanted to check them, they had already voluntarily requested an inspection to show that they had nothing to do with it. After the inspection, there was nothing. Later, Director Mr. suddenly remembered that on a certain evening, a certain young lady had taken things from people's bags when they were studying, and said that it was entrusted by the person who lost the things. So he hurriedly summoned the person who lost the things to ask her if a certain young lady had been entrusted to go upstairs to get things on a certain night. The person who lost the things pondered for a while and answered no. So, a certain young lady was very suspicious. He hurriedly called her to ask her, "Have you seen that person's two watches?" She immediately said, "I don't live in the same room with her. How do I know? If the teacher suspects me, please go upstairs to check my luggage." The director was not polite and went together.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Going, he turned over her two boxes, and did not see the two watches. He took her wallet to look at it, and turned over the waste paper in her wallet without any intention. Then, he saw a repair bill for watches, which stated that three watches were repaired. At this time, her face was unnatural, and she was no longer as calm as before. Seeing that there was progress in the matter, the director hurriedly</p>
<p>Called the lost person to take the watch out for inspection with the ticket. At first glance, it was the two watches she had lost. He came back and reported that it was what she had lost. He measured that Miss XX had become a criminal from a suspect. Seeing that the evidence was found and there was no way to deny it, she began to cry loudly.</p>
<p>At this time, Director Mr. did not care about so many things, and immediately invited her guarantor to come by telephone, and took her out of the school overnight, and gave her an expulsion punishment.</p>
<p>However, what everyone does not understand is that Miss XX's family is rich, her father is an important employee of the bank, her personal clothes are beautiful, she has sparkling diamond rings on her fingers, and there are still more than 300 yuan in fancy banknotes in her wallet when she leaves the school. How could such wealth steal these two watches? It's really incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The scorching sun is in the sky, and the shade is all over the ground. The sisters are going home for summer vacation. On the day of the vacation, everyone in the dormitory is busy tidying up their luggage, and everyone's face is full of pleasant expressions.</p>
<p>When a certain young lady was opening a box to put clothes in, she temporarily placed three ten-yuan bills on the head of the bed. Because she went to a classmate's place next door to get a book, when she came back, the thirty yuan was gone. Yawning, cutting the tongue, the thief's ability is so great, making her panic and surprised. Then she thought, the only person who saw me put the silver down was a certain young lady nicknamed Little Cat, and she sat on my bed to watch when I opened the box to put things in. When I went to get the book, she was still sitting there, and when I came back, she had already left. This money must have been taken privately by her. So she immediately went to report to the training director. The director said, "According to what you said, Little Cat is indeed suspicious, but you have banknotes, and she also has banknotes. Even if you find banknotes on her, how can you say that she stole yours?" But Miss XX said happily, "There is no coincidence that can't be written. The day before yesterday, after my father sent these three banknotes, I took them out under the lamp to examine them. Because I was going home, I unconsciously wrote 'Going Home' in small letters on all the banknotes. If there are these three ten-yuan bills with the three characters 'Going Home' found on her body or in her box, then it is undoubtedly that she stole them." Seeing that she expected it to be accurate and that the thing had a secret mark, the director immediately went together to inspect.</p>
<p>In the corridor, he bumped into Little Cat. The director said, "Miss XX, show me all the banknotes you have on you." Little Cat was suddenly asked and could not refuse. She thought secretly that even if it was the stolen one, everyone has banknotes, why be afraid? So she frankly took it out. The director took it and looked at it. There were a total of five banknotes, and three of the fifteen yuan indeed had the three characters "Going Home". He sneered and said, "Miss XX, are there secret codes on your banknotes?" Little Cat said, "No." The director said, "Then these three with the three characters 'Going Home' are not yours but mine. Let me keep them." Saying that, he pulled her to the training office and said to her in a low voice, "There is no one here. I will tell you frankly that today is a holiday. You don't have to come back here. I will not announce this behavior of yours to the whole school, and I will leave you some face. Are you satisfied?" So Little Cat had no choice but to say goodbye to our school forever. It's a pity that she will graduate from high school next year, but she can't.</p>
<p>On a night with autumn rain, many people were huddled in the third dormitory, talking about their auras.</p>
<p>One said, "Auras are very effective. We can deal with the person who stole the things however we want. According to what I think, let's tattoo the word 'thief' on the face of the person who stole the things, so that her face is branded with the name of the thief, and she doesn't dare to show her face in front of people." Some said to tattoo a flower on her face, some said to tattoo a silver circle, some said tattooing it on the face is too ugly, or tattoo something on her chest, so that she will become someone else's in the future...</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, everyone was laughing so hard that they fell forward and backward. After a burst of laughter stopped, one person said very solemnly, "People stole things in a moment of confusion, and tattooing her face, etc., makes people embarrassed. We should forgive her. I think we should do this. Limit her to return the stolen forty yuan secretly to the owner before twelve o'clock tomorrow morning, and put it in a place that is easy for the owner to see. If she still doesn't return it by tomorrow morning, then it's not a moment of confusion, but she is willing to be a thief. And we don't have to be polite, we will definitely ask someone to give her a big embarrassment." Everyone said okay, okay.</p>
<p>Sure enough, before the first class the next morning, the person who lost the silver walked into the classroom to attend class. When the desk was opened, the pearl was returned to He Pu.</p>

Originally sold for one small foreign coin each, they are now all calculated in large dollars.</p>
<p>The Huiluo Company on Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road announces that it previously sold a large batch of water-damaged goods at a discount due to flooding.

For example, metal military models, electric automatic trains, airplanes, and military toys all contain scientific knowledge and can enhance children's knowledge. In addition, there are sports toys such as ice skates and basketballs, as well as architectural models that cater to children's psychology. They are exquisitely crafted and beneficial to children's physical and mental development. There are also realistic animal models, such as a life-size tiger, in which people can crawl inside and lie in wait in a corner, used as a game tool, which is especially enjoyable for children. These toys arrived last week and are now on display on the fourth floor of the company for anyone to visit.</p>
