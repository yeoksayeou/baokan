<p>教育消息</p>
<p>要聞</p>
<h3>四中全會通過之普及教育奬勵學術以樹建國之大本案</h3>
<p>四中全會朱家驊委員提（普及教育獎勵學術以樹建國之大本案）照教育組審查意見通過交國府飭教育機關斟酌辦理茲將提案原文錄下自本黨第三次全國代表大會通過確定教育宗旨及其實施方針一案以來雖在本届中央執行委員會歷次會議屢有關於教育之提議祗以軍閥叛變軍事頻興以致原定政策未能實施言之痛心我國現在全國統一届與民更始之時本黨應於最短期間樹立教育之基礎俾能逐步實現原定政策使建國大本得以確立訓政任務得以完成爰爲左列之提議敬請公决</p>
<h3>（甲）普及教育</h3>
<p>一義務教育之規定各國均以小學爲限因人民生活程度不一未能供給子女至中學畢業者實居多數雖以美國之富漸臻大學普及之勢而義務教育仍以小學爲限文明進步　小學教育有不能應需求之勢故德國首創於小學畢業後加補習教育義務年限推行以後大收效果各國競相仿效初以年齡滿十四歲爲限繼長增高美國各州中已有增至滿二十二歲爲止者其課程亦由簡而繁　　人於專門之域英國之高級補習教育其程度與大學之一年級相當各國分類之細更不下千數百種歐美農工商業之進步固有賴於學者之發明仍以實行者有相當知識能依於奉行也我國人民程度之低至今猶是一盤散沙受世界交通影響農工商業全部破産人民生計日益困難以致盜賊流行共黨乘機煽惑危亡之禍不在外患而在本身現在除應極力普及教育俾逹不至有失學兒童之目的外另努力於治標興辦補習教育全國之少壯及中年均渾渾噩噩不識不知欲安定社會　固國家於緣木求魚之喻豈但不得而已哉爲今之計應將補習教育同列爲義務教育以期普及國人男女之年未滿五十而不識字者一律分期責令入學遠者罰之</p>
<p>二課程之編定授課時間限每星期兩次每次二小時不得增减增則勞力之人難於持久减則効力太微也課目寓黨義及公民常識於國文中占時間之半餘爲算術於命題及解答插入圖畫教之旣增興趣復益技能德國之初創補習教育亦爲每星期二次每次二小時之定制</p>
<p>三經費之預計綜計全國人口約四萬萬除老糼半數外每班以五十人計之約四百萬班每教室每日教授六班計約需教室十萬一教室以二教員任之約需四十萬人教員薪水及雜費每教室年支三百元年僅六千萬而已全國能勞動者以三萬萬計每人每年負担銀元二角實爲至廉代價</p>
<p>四師資之取材鄉村蒙師及識字之失業者加以短期之訓練即可養成再於每年各農忙期召集測練增其知能不患不能勝任並與繼續服務之保障及年功加俸之獎勵鼓其興趣而堅其事業之心至訓練此項師資每班以五十人至二百人計一訓練機關分設數班全國總計不過千所大縣各設一所小縣聯合設之則於訓練師資之師資選擇以及訓練機關之設備用曾非難事</p>
<p>以上辦法請由中央規定綱領責令各省地方行政當局依限推行如有逾限或不遵照綱領實施者予以嚴厲之處罰中央及省教育行政機關均應隨時派人視察以教育發展之成績爲地方行政人員之考成</p>
<h3>（乙）獎勵學術</h3>
<p>一著作之獎勵日本明治維新經數十年之久英德法文之新書固無不譯本國文字撰述亦日益增多社會有長足之進步幾於世界學術上之研究無一問題無日本人參預其間世界學術之雜誌時有日人之論文或報告發表國際學術地位增高民族地位亦隨之而右昔野今文之進步　顧我國銷聲匿跡竟與南美非洲印度同儔若不奮勉以圖何以立國今之强弱科學之强弱也無論政治軍事外交農工商業非科學無以競進即無以自存欲求我國之自由平等與保存民族於永久爭全世界之光榮非國人咸從事學術不可欲學術之普及非獎勵國人之著作不可擬請每年指定五千萬元凡有著作得呈請教育部提交中央研究院或國立大學教授會核審定優予獎勵</p>
<p>二學術研究常　圖書館及研究室之助尤賴共同研究互相商榷業以專而精雖同一程度之士若各研究一小問題必各有所發明較諸廣泛不專者必有特殊進展若於設圖較豐人才較集之各國立大學其程度較高之教授令其肆力於研究則就圖書室研究室之便並以所得即教授大學諸生較其他人士之獨立研究獨有心得待成熟完全而後公諸世者利益多多擬請指定專欵五十萬乃至一百萬元作爲研究補助及獎金之用由各國立大學每年二次推定人選呈請教育部决定於各校原有規定預算外特别分項補助以資激勸行之十年必可成効大著</p>

<p>華塞司唐斯濮脫戴祿勃爾特飛利浦霍金斯郎　氏依格頓史湯雷蕭　氏茂迪斯</p>
<h3>眞茹表演至矣盡矣</h3>
<p>華塞斯爲海上勁旅之一史高托盃初賽淘汰稱　一時之霍華斯惟眞茹亦非弱者故昨日相堪逢謂棋逢敵手勝負未能臆測者惜戴中鋒足傷未愈不能出場前鋒實力大受損害梅洪　又以事未賽以致徒有機綠攻門乏力爲之惋惜但後衛實力有口皆碑梁官濂之守門江善敬之右衛時時有卓絶之表演陳鎭和之中堅左右指揮勞苦功高惜全隊隊員時有欲顧前顧後以致疲於奔命者然縱觀全隊美矣善矣眞茹雖敗已竭盡其力可無媿矣</p>
<h3>軍辇载雖盛良機迭失</h3>
<p>銀笛旣鳴健兒角逐阳秉祥自左角人童榮文自右方進雖俱無功聲　甚盛眞茹以極鞏固之後衛線使前鋒一意進攻球多盤旋於華塞斯陣地惟每失之遲綏或失之單人四馬孤軍無助叩關攻門廢然而返</p>
<h3>化險成夷冀禍成福</h3>
<p>敵人抵　旣烈亦死命反攻於是險象迭生郎　二氏舉　來攻及至眞茹門前内衛不愼致判罰十二碼之球郎氏立踼觀衆凛然咸爲眞茹不幸豈意球直飛入適爲梁官濂拍出雖成角球敵卒莫可奈何繼而郎氏又攻亦爲梁所救衆方以爲化險爲夷眞茹將入樂境矣上半時告終各無成就</p>
<h3>盛勢漸衰禍患遂乘</h3>
<p>觀上半時眞茹之努力進攻卒歸無效幸後衛力强敵人未逞乃成和局惟下半時之能否一氣如前勇而不衰者則觀者無不總總慮之矣果然陣地旣易軍勢不同陳秉祥左右盤旋亦無建樹徙見敵勢汹汹左右齊來唐斯攻門梁官濂仆地救之復次陳家球連破敵陣至門前又被阻天也不佑童榮文正攻門球回彈適中頭上昏倒於地幸片刻即愈衆鼓掌賀之不意陣容不整之際精神衰　之時郎氏舉足而攻球已不救離終局僅十五分鐘時也禍不單行敵得角球蕭氏得之而攻球　未入郎氏舉足遂定勝負眞茹雖竭力反攻時不我待矣</p>

<h3>社會矚目之唐博士控妻案</h3>
<p>昨日宣告辯論終結</p>
<p>法庭擠得水洩不通</p>
<p>唐博士痛心要自殺</p>
<p>兩方律師雄辯一場</p>
<p>轟動滬埠之經濟博士唐惠玄控妻鄒愛貞與陳根偉通姦經上海地方法院判决被告無罪後唐即提起上訴曾奉兩次審問調查證據昨日爲合議庭辯論下午二時開庭午飯後旁聽者已羣集於第一法庭上旁聽席告滿後法院又爲排櫈兩行未幾又已告滿後來者均鵠立其中以女子爲多婦女協會主幹陳振權女士亦到庭旁聽旁聽者計四五百人</p>
<p>擠得水洩不通至二時後即告開庭問官爲刑庭長沈炳榮陪席推事章承鈞馬壽南上訴人代理律師石碩袁仰安被告律師鄭毓秀（王德懿複代）嚴蔭武江一平等問官先傳鄒愛貞陳根偉到庭問鄒年籍答二十五歲上海人問陳根偉答二十八歲上海人三元機器公司執業官命暫退傳唐惠玄問年歲籍貫答三十六歲廣西人住大興街晋成里十九號編書問第一審判决不服嗎答因爲不服故上訴問你同鄒愛貞同居否答她拒絶同居問幾時起答去年八月六日我到上海問何處來答漢口來滬後她呌我搬到旅館裹去住兩星期到廣東去的今年八月九日由香港歸她又拒絶我問一天没有同居嗎答在她母家住一夜一個人</p>
<p>睡在亭子間内問她什麽理由拒絶你答她說因地方小天熱人多不便至於今年拒絶她没有說出理由問</p>
<p>你到旅館内她來陪你嗎答没有問你疑心否答已疑心曾向她說夫妻有同居義務奈她不理問夫婦感情好否答以前很好直與陳根偉姘識即不好我到上海來看見這個人詢問說是名陳根偉是過繼兒子但其姪可以證明並没有這件事問幾時知道有戀愛答去年由朋友陳碧·翟一之·等告訴我過問他兩人如何知道答他兩人到我岳母家去找我才知問他兩人如何知道答見</p>
<p>兩人種種舉動問你不在家他們决不會坐定的答是我好友故曾坐一息後來我質問鄒愛貞她說與陳根偉是朋友的關係上海司空見慣的而她家以前住金神父路陳根偉在房中洗澡鄒愛貞則往洗臉雖未曾洗澡亦正在預備不過我是已疑心有一次陳根偉吃剩的稀飯鄒愛貞拿去吃了有一次我去拿書她們行爲不對我質問她她說</p>
<p>欺侮我廣西人而娘姨周阿妹亦向我告訴卡羅又親眼看見她們姦情還有一個朋友國朝海他是照相館内的侍者他亦親見問幾時提到的答八月十六日問如何去捉答公安局派兩個巡警我有兩個朋友連我五個人去的問去時什麽様答娘姨早起來門已開了我走胶巡警後隨問進去還是前房還是後房答他們是一樓一底並没有前後房我進去</p>
<p>看見兩人在仙她們房屋只有一樓一亭子間問你先提那一個答一同捉的問你一人捉還是巡警捉答一同捉的問她們起床嗎答没有我進　去後她們才起來巡警是何鳳麟上去的問她們如何形景答男穿睡衣女穿短褲問你當時先捉她妹妹答没有是在亭子間内問據何鳳麟說他没有上去答他受人壓迫問他到底是個警察有什麽壓迫答事實上是如此的問周阿妹亦說没有講答她受人運動問她們旣運動於後何不運動於前答那不明</p>
<p>我還有兩件事去年八月十六日我到香港去上船後至夜址時歸家鄒愛貞來開門我看見陳根偉睡在她房仙地上我向鄒愛貞說乃與我大吵一塲又我於去年五月十五後同鄒愛貞同居一星期不料在香港接到信十二月十號左右養一小孩現在已死計算没有七個月若是小産亦不能養官云月份已七月或因先天不足答已死了我是萬分痛心若不涉訟要自殺也官云</p>
<p>死是萬萬不可値不得的至此問證人國朝海供卅三鹽城人曾在皇后照相館爲侍者鄒愛貞陳根偉曾同來呌我倒兩杯茶她們什麽情形没有看見至此問鄒愛貞結婚幾年了答八年問向來好否答甚好問幾時起不好答今年八月十日他歸家至十四日他說他是廣西人要到廣西去還是私自離婚我們不肯問旣甚好爲何要離答聽了朋友之言問朋友豈能拆散人之家庭答十四日他搬去後十六來捉姦涉訟爲是姓徐的朋友在仙的問陳根偉是你何人答乾兄問你住何處答與妹在亭子間内母則前樓陳則後樓後因天熱故同母住前樓</p>
<p>因有南風凉爽照相館是開的但不常去若去是查賑問卡羅看見你們的答若做不法事卡羅亦不能進我們房問十六日捉姦如何答我正睡聽得聲響看見陳根偉與我妹在扶梯上我出去遂被捉去他們問我妹何人爲姊我即自承姊故捉我的唐因要離婚故誣告並擬使</p>
<p>世上人睡駡我至生小孩一節是我於去年三月到宜昌去與唐同居一星期到十二月十五日養小孩的至此問陳根偉問你與鄒家是何關係答繼子是十二歲去的我六歲死父十四歲喪母六年前曾娶妻彼時與繼母分居但娶妻兩年妻死又與繼母同居聽繼母說唐惠玄因欲離婚起見乃來誣告我問離婚方法甚多如何用此不名譽之起訴答這不明瞭問屋小人多殊不方便答吃飯便利耳我與鄒愛貞並没有曖昧問有一茶房說你們常常到照相館去的答不出去的問八月十六日來捉你睡在何處答我生病睡在後樓兩個人</p>
<p>將我拖到樓梯上見唐惠玄未幾又將鄒月貞拖出唐去不是愛貞聽見出來就捉去了訊至此遂命律師辯論先由石碩稱（一）卡羅之證言親眼看見（二）國朝海之證明常常去被告雖提出兩個證人一個英國人一個俄國人但均稱與陳根偉五年七年之友人能否推翻卡羅之證言乎若寃枉陳根偉何以又欲寃枉鄒愛貞請癈棄原判云云袁仰安稱</p>
<p>唐惠玄很忠實的以其歷史觀他是清華畢業生官費留學美國若非痛心疾首何肯爲此故爲千準萬確且有公安局的案子云云被告方面辯護人王德懿稱告訴要有實據告訴人舉出之證人周阿妹而與告訴人不認得且旣有中華路家中之可以行姦何必到照相館去通姦上海旅館甚多何必在自已照相館中而使攝影師所見此乃出乎情理之外者嚴蔭武稱唐惠玄之供詞甚多矛盾　例如亭子間如何不住亭子問下是灶間住在内</p>
<p>熱天好比蒸籠當然前樓風凉以此而爲上訴不近情理且其第一次稱巡警同上樓第二次說他先上去而警察說陳根偉穿睡衣鄒愛貞穿短衣而唐稱愛貞上身赤膞第二次又說小衣未後又飛來一個卡羅均出乎情理之外者故請維持原判江一平稱犯罪原則要有證據即捉姦亦須捉雙即卡羅說十月問兩人一絲不掛在小房子又　不可能之事家中並非無幽會機會不必另組一幽會之地方右偶有同出刑法上亦只有有夫之婦與人通姦處二年以下有期徒刑未聞有夫之婦與人同行而亦如上之處罰之理云云官遂諭辯論終結本月廿八日下午二時實行</p>
<h3>譚梅影離婚案</h3>
<p>昨日開審聽者擁擠</p>
<p>譚意堅决難歸於好</p>
<p>趙光祖尚不肯同意</p>
<p>辯論終結定期宣判趙光祖與譚眉影結婚至今未滿十月近因譚氏控告趙所眷之妓女梅妃老九詐取地産契據一案趙頗腹非之對譚氏感情逐漸破裂甚至動輒兇毆課氏</p>
<p>不堪其虐乃向特區地方法院提起離婚之訴昨晨由周逹仁推事開第九法庭審理兩造皆於九時後相繼到院譚服元色絲絨黑皮領之大衣髮作綣曲狀</p>
<p>面有戚容與閨友二三默坐候審處趙衣菜青素色葛袍面目白晳洵屬翩翩年少旋周推事升座此</p>
<p>一對怨偶始同至法庭庭址不廣坐位無多而旁聽之男女則擁擠異常大有立錐無地之槪周推事先傳訊原告譚眉影據供二十二歲蘇州人現住西門春暉里八號母爱趙光祖係我丈夫甫於今年正月十八日結婚我請求</p>
<p>離婚理由純因丈夫旣無職業又不讀書專務宿娼吃大菜看戲夜間恒住於外非至換衣則不歸家且其性極暴戾動輒無端毆辱而負債纍纍債主登門坐索須我爲之對付以是種種原因所受痛苦非常故</p>
<p>請求離婚繼傳訊被告趙光祖供二十三歲父爲寳山籍我係生長上海現住華德路六十號譚眉影乃我之妻彼今請求離婚我殊未能同意頃彼所供毆打等事完全不確而彼</p>
<p>操持家政處置井然我甚感之周推事嗣訊以有無職業趙供現在外灘十七號友邦保險公司爲副買辦甫於昨日就事又訊以是否在外游蕩則答稱此爲往事自與譚結緍後即涂狎邪游矣周推事遂向譚曰汝夫已云不再涉足花叢及不將汝虐待當不必要求離婚譚續供稱丈夫所語珠不足信當</p>
<p>新婚之夕彼於深夜四時方歸以後數夜皆宿於外且已屢次規勸奈終不改我料此人已無希望迫而出此我亦注重舊道德者應守女子從一而終之義故離婚後不再嫁人擬求學問以爲他日</p>
<p>服務社會周推事見其意甚堅决難以勸令和解遂訊以被趙毆打情狀及有無在塲目覩者譚稱女傭高張氏盡知當時情形庭上即命該傭婦退出庭外然後着原告將被毆次數與時日詳述譚復訴稱</p>
<p>前後被打共計五次第一次時在夜半因被告尚欲出外我追至扶梯上加以阻止致遭批頰四下第二次亦因被告欲出我將汽車鎖匙收藏彼竟將我由床上拖下連　我頰並用口咬第三次亦因不許其往外阻之於扶梯脚被告則揪我髮而兇毆之以上一二向兩次日期已不能記憶第三次則爲七月二十五日事至八月十三日被告自外歸來忽</p>
<p>潛服鴉片自殺我即延西醫來家救治打針服藥之後因醫囑是夜不可使之睡熟故我一見其睡輒呼之醒而彼每次醒後則掌我頰一下詎至次日彼又潛服來沙面藥水自殺謂不應將其汽車買賣我當時向其曰君祗須伏於家内跬步不出倘有來訪者我則告以</p>
<p>君已死矣不料又被毆辱我對被告已屬毫無希望决與離婚否則所受精神痛苦不知伊於胡底周推事乃以譚所供各節據以訊趙而趙僅承認八月十三日之爭吵謂其時原告怒毁雜物故强止之至自殺事則因感觸無</p>
<p>人生樂趣而萌此念並表示往後不將原告虐待及不荒游無度庭上因原告要求離婚之理由亦僅指被告狎游虐待茲趙旣當庭懺悔特再勸原告抛棄離婚之主張但譚氏以趙失信不祗一次且前曾親書允許</p>
<p>離婚筆據實難再與同居周推事遂命開始辯論原告律師請求依法判離蓋以爲無和解之餘地而被告之律師則請求寬以時日俾於限内仍令兩造同居倘終不能回復情形再行裁判未由郭懷璞</p>
<p>發表意見略謂夫婦間發生意見於生理上關係極重而其影響則小足妨害家大足弱及民族至於毆打尤爲中外法律所不許在美國不但准予離婚且須賠償被毆者之損失本案事實已極明瞭本檢察官亦甚希望雙方能於一定期限内仍同復好感合作到老如彼此實難融洽勉强結合使皆受痛苦則不若勞燕分飛云云周推事訊畢諭候本月二十七日上午宣判</p>
<h3>明年公共租界不再有跑狗塲</h3>
<p>工部局非正式通知</p>
<p>賽狗場本月底結束</p>
<p>公共租界工部局上星期三董事會議議决禁閉跑狗塲但取締辦法暫不宣布等情已誌本報惟上次工部局董事會議結果因工部局總裁費信惇及全體董事俱守緘默遂引起外界之疑　本埠泰晤士報等復向工部局詰責蓋謂如此有關租界利害之重要問題不應嚴守秘密工部局因於昨日始稍稍將眞消息間接在字林西報披露工部局禁閉跑狗塲之堅决態度遂告證實公共租界内之明園及申園兩跑狗塲因天寒關係每年自十一月底停止賽狗春暖時節再行恢復惟今年則因工部局之積極禁賭運動已非正式通知兩跑狗塲主人着於本月底停賽時即辦理全部結束明春不得恢復賽狗現此事工部局根據此項原則仍在與跑狗塲主人協議中茲將字林報及大美晚報之紀載移譯錄下以供參攷</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>大美晚報云公共租界工部局　　　正式通知界内兩賽狗塲職員擁在下月本　賽狗季節終了之後勒令永久停報此項通知係於星期一工部局召集賽狗職員晤商時當面者知並謂工部局毫無苛待賽狗已在必禁之列兩塲　有惟爲租界利益計賽狗已在必禁之列兩塲　有合理提議工部局甚　考慮當時兩塲職員未曾提出意見料下星期一雙方繼續晤商時行將有所表示</p>
<p>又大美晚報記者本日（即昨日）探悉工部局方面預料賽狗場對於此　當不致有法律舉動即使訴諸法律亦不足畏因兩賽狗場俱未領照工部局可以命其停閉且經營該場之賽狗總會雖受英國法律管轄其會員旣不限一國人民同時亦受他國法律管轄况該塲賽無法律根據否則今年六月間工部局限制其賽狗次數時已可有法律舉動又據熱悉滬事者　凡娛樂塲所及酒排間等欲領取執照必須先得工部局與該管總領事核准簽字故此　若另生枝節工部局可勒令領照並要求其獲得會員所屬國家之領事悉數簽字倘此層不能辦到則該塲無法律上之基礎</p>
<p>但今日（即昨日）賽跑協會有限公司書記湯笙洋行與上海萬國賽狗有限公司書記克佐時洋行又向大美晚報聲稱關於本日字林西報與上海泰晤士報所紀賽狗新聞一節茲特聲明兩公司及其董事迄今並未接奉工部局或其行政人員正式通告該局已擬有若何緊動</p>
<p>字林報云頃聞公共租界工部局已切實决定禁止界内賽狗惟實行此項决議之方法猶在討論之中一時未必能發表因關於法律方面尚須徵詢顧問之意見而與賽狗公司董事之正式談話亦未完畢至工部局諸董事早日禁止賽狗之心頗爲堅决因賽狗至本月底將以天　停　倘明春再聽其繼續舉行甚非市民之益現董事會中聞華董對於一切賭博皆極反對外董方面則日僑在租界内人數最衆業已大受賽狗之害據日官廳與僑商領袖協仝調查結果所有日僑犯罪原因百分之九十九直接由於賽狗而起故日僑主張禁止最力美國僑民與賽狗極少關係但自美僑全體言之料亦贊成設禁故此時不贊成禁絶賽狗者在西人中除若干因賽狗而直接獲利者外不過一小部份而已</p>

<h3>今夜西人管弦樂隊演奏中國音樂家的創作</h3>
<p>— 張若谷</p>
<p>作曲………黃今吾君</p>
<p>指揮………梅百器君</p>
<p>地點……大光明戲院</p>
<p>時間……今夜九點鐘</p>
<p>多謝黃今吾先生的盛意我們從來没有見過面但承他不棄前天特地託黃心邨先生轉送給我一張上海工部局管弦樂隊星期交響樂會的入座券他們請我去聽十一月二十三夜的音樂會因爲在這一個夜樂會的演奏節目中列有黃今吾先生的一首大作呌做（懹舊曲）是懹念他已亡女友的一首序曲原名呌做"In　Maemorian"　Overtufe將在意大利音樂家梅百器Mario　Pacl指揮之下由管弦樂隊全體西人樂師演奏這是一件打破上海音樂界紀錄的大事與前年譚抒眞先生出席該樂隊的樂聖貝多芬百年紀念會奏演次高部提琴是同様可以喚起中國聽衆注意的盛事</p>
<p>我和黃今吾先生雖則到如今還没有見過面但是我已經在黃心邨先生編印的（我們的音樂朋友）小册子上看見過他的照相了這是一位年富力强的青年歲數和我差不多不過多了一副眼鏡他的廣闊的額角好像已告訴過我他是一個多思好學的音樂青年他是青華學校的畢業生二十二歲畢業於美國歐柏林大學音樂科即進歐柏林音樂院民國十八年得耶魯大學音樂學士位時年二十五歲這一首（懷舊曲）就是他得學士位的試作成績曾獲選在耶路大學年終音樂大會中表演得到報紙上許多很好的批評</p>
<p>中國國立音樂專科學校校長蕭友梅先生因爲欽佩他的才學特聘爲教務主任兼樂理教授並主編（樂藝季刋）蕭先生這一次還做了一篇（黃今吾的懷舊曲）介紹說明得很詳細（見十一月十八日本報青年園地欄）聞已油印多份大約是預備在今夜會塲分送的吧</p>
<p>至於黃今吾先生的這一首樂曲的製作價値我因爲還没有聽過演奏所不敢先來估定不過工部局管弦樂隊的指揮者梅百器先生是一個經騐豐富鑑斷嚴格的音樂家黃今吾先生的這一首試作能中選編入今夜音樂會的節目中正式公開演奏那不但是作者個人的榮幸也正是替我們中國青年的音樂界爭得一些光榮的一個絶好機會希望愛好藝術</p>

<h3>建光球隊</h3>
<p>— 一德</p>
<p>法學院女同學組織</p>
<p>體育一科法學院雖不是執滬上各大學牛耳但都異常注意不　學校當局對此提倡的不遺飭力最近復特闢一極形壯麗之藍球塲增購若干運動器具如綱球綱球拍藍球運動員一律仗青毛絨衣等每季更有運動會之舉行各種錦標之獎勵即同學間復又自　組織許多球隊同學們對於體育之興味亦足多矣惟女同學間似太消沉了</p>
<p>那是在去年的秋季吧開學時當局曾請一位女指導師秦浩然女士率領同學作球顃之運動可是一般女士們呢每當上這課時不是姗姗而來遲便是深居高樓而裹足不前三三五五地星散在操塲上弄得雖名振滬上的秦女士亦無可如何這種狀態當然維持不長久從此女生球塲上便再也不見秦女士的蹤跡了女生運動無形中便宣告了破産一直一直經過了快一年的光景依然没重生絲毫生氣難道女同學間竟無一人擅長運動嗎竟無一人具熱心地起來率領一般同學作課外球類等運動嗎那是不敢輕於武斷或者是因爲怕難爲情而不願上前亦未可知</p>
<p>如今發現了一綫曙光這僅一綫的曙光當然是由得人而來上面所言擅長運動而又具熱心的人在此略爲介紹薛珍女士是本學期進來的轉自大同在中學時代曾參加全蘇省運動會獲田徑賽亞軍對於球類尤所特長尤端女士陳善女士來亞珍女士等均擅長運動益精球類有了這幾位女士女同學間之球隊自不難期其成立</p>
<p>不消說發起人當然就是上述的諸位籌備不三日已於昨晚正式成立了出席全體女同學三分之二强公推薛珍女士主席呂寄嘩女士紀錄選舉結果薛珍女士與尤端女士當選爲隊長陳善女士來亞珍女士毛超羣女士等爲幹事呂寄嘩女士爲文書金光橘女士爲交際討論事項多件散會時咸謂隊長得人足證薛尤二女士實衆望所歸也</p>

<h3>讀俞劍華氏的個展</h3>
<p>— 錢君</p>
<p>近來的趣味忽然轉向到書畫的嗜好上去了每逢有展覽會的開幕我必定要去走一趟的</p>
<p>這回恰是俞劍華氏的個展我又照例去走了一趟</p>
<p>在我的意想中早測得俞氏的藝才了但也許我太氣小了不曾測得過分遠大待我一觀實際以後我的意想竟完全打破而重起了一種實在的估價</p>
<p>他的山水如果以我們的古國的評語來說那未當然可以用遒勁·蒼古·峻嚴·雄渾·清逸·超絶等等的形容詞來讚揚但我覺行如此地抄些旣成的詞藻來解釋他的山水似乎太便宜了太迂了我們應該再用一種新的眼光來觀察他的山水</p>
<p>我的直覺覺得他的　勃的天才使他不能不爆發爲山水畫的極品而使當時的一切同類作家褪色獨覇了吳待秋以後的畫壇</p>
<p>他這次個展中的作品其中有幾幅的作風深似布克林（Bocklin畫死之島波之戲的崇美死的德國理想派畫家）的作品雖然洋畫與國畫的畫法不能牽在一處立論但表現情感的一端當有可以相同的地方所以他的作品中頗有那德國才子的風格而有靜穆的死的美德的作品出現</p>
<p>再在他的作品中對於點苔的技巧頗能使我感到一種特殊的興味散亂的多色的苔的點法與西徨克（Signac）修勒（Surat）的點畫相去不遠這在國畫中我們可以認爲新的表現我們是應該頌揚的</p>
<p>至於山水畫的　　能夠奇峭得使人不可思議因爲他是徧游名山大川的所以能雄視一世而無敵手的</p>
<p>再看花卉在我也許是因爲趣味的不同所以我不想說什麽不過對於色彩我是始終推崇的</p>
<p>我們的古國中尚有一種古怪的美術就是发書法在别國是没有的所以這項東西更可稱奇了俞氏的書法篆文的我非常愛好我看他的書法如讀谷崎潤一郎氏的小說同様地使我感到至上的滿足</p>
<p>所以俞氏的個展給我們的精神的養料是豐富的對於畫壇是一支銳利的白光是着實可以歌頌的</p>

<h3>America's Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>After Extreme Prosperity, There Must Be Extreme Decline. The United States Has Always Been Proud of Being the Hegemon of the Economic World. Because of the Extreme Development of Its Industry, Its Economic Power Has Also Leaped Forward. Its Domestic Wealth Was Unparalleled in the World. It Was Not Expected That It Would Be Impacted by the World Trend Today. Industry Has Fallen Into a Stagnant State, and the Economic World Has Also Suffered a Great Impact. After This Bank Closure Crisis Arose, It Almost Responded From East to West, and It Was Impossible to Stop. The Dangerous Situation Was Absolutely Beyond Imagination. According to American Telegrams, the Number of Banks That Closed in Various Places in the Past Week Reached More Than 130. According to News From Chicago, 25 Banks Closed in Various Southern and Central States Within 24 Hours, and the Number of Those That Followed Is Still Unknown. Some People Said That This Crisis Was Due to Too Many Withdrawals From Depositors. However, the Reason Why There Were So Many Withdrawals Was Due to the Downturn in Industry, High Unemployment, and the Daily Depletion of People's Wealth, Leading to Public Anxiety. Since the Source of the Crisis Is Very Far and Wide, Its Relief Cannot Be Accomplished in a Short Time. American Telegrams Said That the United States May Inevitably Face a Major Crisis. The Tension of the Situation Can Be Seen.</p>
<p>The Expansion of America's Economic Power Has Long Been Watched by European Countries, Who Have Been Constantly Concerned About the Intrusion of Its Power and Have Been Striving to Deal With It in a United Way. Now That the Bank Crisis Has Arisen, From the Perspective of Investment, Various Countries Will Indeed Be Affected by It. From the Perspective of Economic Competition, It Provides Various Countries With an Opportunity to Target It. Therefore, Its Crisis Is Definitely Not a Minor Matter Regarding the Future Changes in the World Economy.</p>

<h3>Liu Zhi Hosts a Reception for the Capital Press</h3>
<p>Nanjing. On the 22nd, Liu Zhi Hosted a Reception for the Press at the Anle Hotel, Attended by More Than 50 People. He Reported That 1. This Great War Eliminated the Large Groups of Reactionary Forces One After Another, Which Can Give the People of the Country a Great Lesson. All Those Who Betray the Central Government and Violate the Three Principles of the People Inevitably Fail. In the Future, There Will Be No More Rebellions, and We Can Exert All Our Efforts to Resist Foreign Aggression. 2. Disaster Victims Are Everywhere in Henan Province. The Heart-Stirring and Continuous Trenches of More Than a Thousand Li Are Vividly Visible. Countless People Have Been Displaced Due to Bitter徵暴斂 [zhēng bào liǎn] (exorbitant taxes and levies) and Drafting of Soldiers. In the Future, the First Step Will Be to Restore Order and Summon the Refugees to Gradually Seek Reconstruction. Henan Province Is Known as the Central State in Ancient Times, and It Is the Earliest Source of Culture. Recently, It Has Fallen Into Decline Due to the 軍閥　迫 [jūnfá pò] (Oppression by warlords). The Three Principles of the People Cannot Be Recognized at All, Which Is a Hindrance to the Construction of Politics and the Development of the Northwest and the Plans for Immigration and Border Reclamation. I Hope That the Capital News Media Will Constantly Convey News of Cultural Undertakings to the People of Henan to Change the Atmosphere.

<h3>The Indian Round Table Conference General Assembly Discussion Ends</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st. The Indian Round Table Conference Has Held a General Assembly for Five Days So Far. The Speeches Made by the Last Few People Are Still Nothing More Than Demands for an Indian Federation. Captain Muhammad Khan, A Muslim Who Previously Served in the Indian Army, Said That the Army Is a Guarantee Against the Unlimited Ambitions of Foreigners. If British Warships Withdraw, Then Tens of Millions of People in the Provinces of Madras and Bombay Will Be Easily Subjected to Foreign Trampling. He Meant That the Army Should Be Under the Administration of an Administrative Council Led by the Governor General of India and Not Subject to Political Influence. Soldiers Must Be Recruited From Various Martial Ethnic Groups in India. The Hindu, Jie Hafu, Said That He Believed That the Difficulties Between Hindus and Muslims Were Not as Severe as Reported. In General, Young People All Know That for the Sake of India's Unity, All Differences in Class, Religion, and Ethnicity Must Be Eliminated. The Chairman of the British Indian Delegation, the Muslim, Aga Khan, Said That Since the Opinions of the Assembly Are Now Consistent and They Want Self-Government, They Should Ask the United Kingdom to Grant Them a Framework of Self-Government, So That the Assembly Can Draw a Picture on It at Leisure, So That All Aspects of India, Including British Merchants, Are Satisfied. Chairman, British Prime Minister MacDonald, Made a Final Speech to Conclude the Discussion of the General Assembly, Saying That the Nature of This Conference Is Unusual and Can Be Regarded as a Meeting Where the Indian Federation, the British Government, and the British Parliament Are Listed Together. The Future Is Very Different From the Past. This Has Been Decided Here. The Conference Itself Is an Acknowledgment of Permanent Status. In the Last Few Days, It Was Not Only Sass Terry Who Changed His Views. The Speeches at the Conference Had a Great Influence on Feelings. The British Government Has Not Abandoned What the British Government Allowed After 1917. The British Government Has Accepted All Formally Declared Statements. The British Government Must Deal With the Practical Needs of the Situation. He Does Not Like the Word "Difficulty." The Indian Problem Is Still the Problem of the Imperial Conference. The Imperial Conference Issued a Declaration in 1926 and Implemented This Declaration in 1930. We Only Need to Sit in a Room With Complete Trust and We Can Eventually Find a Solution. If This Conference Achieves an Agreement Within Six Weeks, Then You in India and We Here Must Deal With This Agreement Responsibility. The Speeches Made by the Indian Princes Have Changed the Situation and Made the Duties of This Conference Easier and More Difficult. All the Publics Have Made Great Contributions to Opening the Door to a Truly Unified Federated India. Good Debating Words Have Not Resolved the Difficult Problem. A Practical Answer Must Be Given to Various Questions About the Nature of the Federation, Such as the Nature of the Central Cooperative Structure and the Relationship of This Structure to the Provinces and Public Countries, So That It Can Be Included in the British Parliament's Bill. No Matter What Constitution It Is, There Must Be Two Fundamental Needs, That Is, the Constitution Must Work and Must Evolve. The History of the Constitutions of Various Overseas Autonomous Territories Is No Different. We Have Failed to Create a Static Constitution. The General Assembly Has Divided Into Small Committees to Work Separately. He Hopes That Their Work Will Have Good Results, So That They Can Return to India Joyfully, Increase the Friendship Between Britain and India, and Expand Their Desire for Cooperation.</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Disarmament Preparatory Committee Passes British Proposal</h3>
<p>Advocating Limiting Annual Totals for Army, Navy, and Air Force; U.S. and Japanese Representatives Vote Against; Reuters, Geneva, 21st – The Disarmament Preparatory Committee made further progress today, passing the British proposal to limit armaments based on the annual total of army, navy, and air force with a vote of nineteen to two. The United States and Japan opposed it. A motion to limit various armaments separately was rejected by a vote of eight to seven. However, a French representative's amendment advocating that the total limit should be as low as possible was accepted by the majority.</p>
<h3>Peruvian and Cuban Cabinets Tender Resignations</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 22nd – A dispatch from the capital of Peru states that the provisional cabinet formed after the revolution has resigned, likely due to public dissatisfaction with recent handling of labor unrest.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Havana, 21st – Another coup d'état is rumored to be brewing in Cuba today. Popular rumor has it that the cabinet has resigned because the parliament has twice in the past two months granted President Machado special powers to temporarily suspend the national constitution. President Machado has now obtained dictatorial powers from the parliament to quell disturbances before the general election. According to unconfirmed reports, all cabinet members have tendered their resignations to Machado to enable him to quell the internal strife as soon as possible, but their resignations have not yet been approved.</p>
<h3>Banking Crisis Spreads Unabated in Various U.S. States</h3>
<p>130 Banks Close in One Week; Reuters, New York, 21st – Eleven more banks in five southern and lower midwestern states closed their doors today.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 21st – The United States may be facing a major financial crisis. According to reports from various locations, 130 banks have closed in the past week. News from Chicago today indicates that 25 banks in the southern and midwestern states closed in 24 hours. Observers say that the continuous bank closures are due to excessive withdrawals by depositors. The authorities are deeply concerned about this phenomenon and are actively seeking ways to reverse the situation.</p>
<h3>Nationalist Government's American Advisor Meets with Hoover to Discuss China Issue</h3>
<p>Content Kept Secret; Associated Press, Washington, 21st – Senator Walsh and Luo Pinjie, the American advisor to the Chinese Nationalist government, met with President Hoover today to discuss the United States' policy towards China. Walsh declined to disclose the content of the discussion.</p>
<h3>Finnish National Defense Budget</h3>
<p>National, Helsinki, 21st – Finland's national defense budget for next year totals 100 million Finnish marks, with 56 million for the army, 15 million for the navy, and 29 million for the air force (approximately US$2.50 per 100 Finnish marks).</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Prepares to Deal with the Diet Session</h3>
<p>Opposition Parties Determined to Fight to the Death; Movement to Support General Ugaki for Prime Minister Gains Momentum; Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd – The Minseito Party, believing that Prime Minister Hamaguchi will recover well and be able to personally attend the Diet session after the recess, has decided on its policy for dealing with the situation. It plans to hold a joint discussion between party executives and cabinet members from the party at the beginning of next month to deliberate on various issues. The upcoming Diet session will address many important issues, including the economic recession, unemployment, supplementary plans, tax cuts, and rice prices. Even if Prime Minister Hamaguchi personally attends, it will be difficult for him to preside over the session. Therefore, except for particularly important issues, it has been decided that each minister will be responsible for their respective areas. Interior Minister Adachi will assist Hamaguchi in unifying the government and coordinating with various parties. In terms of the Diet battle, the House of Representatives is expected to see fierce attacks from the opposition parties, who are determined to fight to the death, causing considerable turmoil. The party relies on its absolute majority to ensure the smooth passage of important bills. The House of Peers will raise the London Naval Treaty issue again. In addition, issues such as supplementary plans, the labor union law, amendments to the election law, and unemployment will inevitably be subject to considerable criticism. The government is currently carefully preparing to address these issues.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd – The Seiyukai Party has decided to thoroughly criticize the Hamaguchi cabinet's actions over the past year and a half during this winter's Diet session. Although it is a minority party, it is determined to fight to the death and will launch a fierce attack on the government. The points on which it will attack the government are roughly as follows: (1) Although the government boasts that it has made great efforts to balance the budget for next year, this is not the case. The estimated revenue is too high, which is used to obscure the budget. The point that this endangers the foundation of public finances cannot be ignored. (2) The surplus funds from disarmament were said to be used for tax cuts to reduce the burden on the people, but this has not been done. This is essentially abandoning the face of a public party and deceiving the people. (3) Under the guise of relieving unemployment, local government bonds are issued to appease the situation. While abandoning the principle of not issuing bonds, it still pretends that nothing is happening. The central government has not taken any measures to relieve unemployment, which is inappropriate. (4) As a result of issuing local government bonds to appease the situation, local finances are under great pressure. The central government should bear the responsibility, but it is now burdened and feels great difficulty. (5) The military system reform promised to the people is not clearly stated in the budget, which is extremely insincere. (6) The rice price policy is lenient, and farmers are in poverty, which is the government's greatest failure.</p>
<p>Military News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd – Since Prime Minister Hamaguchi's misfortune, among politicians and strategists, some have planned to stage a drama taking advantage of the internal strife within the Minseito Party over the issue of the successor to the party president. They would unite disgruntled elements from both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, recruit General Ugaki to establish a new political party, and rely on Koizumi Sakutaro for the movement towards the Seiyukai. It is questionable to what extent the recent plan has progressed. In short, the protagonist is General Ugaki, the so-called candidate for prime minister, so this is attracting considerable attention.</p>
<h3>Reports of Unrest in the Soviet Union Are Not True</h3>
<p>National, Berlin, 21st – Upon inquiring with reliable sources in Moscow, it has been learned that reports from New York of a Red Army mutiny, the imprisonment of Stalin, and a Russian revolution are completely untrue. Moscow and other provinces are peaceful and stable, with no signs of unrest. Furthermore, the Vorwärts newspaper of the German Social Democratic Party recently reported that General Galen and other high-ranking military and political officials were arrested for plotting to overthrow Stalin. This has also been officially denied by the Russian government. Currently, traffic between Berlin and Moscow is normal, and German newspapers and news agencies have not directly received any reports of unrest in Russia.</p>
<h3>Paris Express Derails, Injuring People</h3>
<p>Caused by Loose Roadbed; Reuters, Nantes, 22nd – The express train from Paris derailed near Oudon last night because recent heavy rains and flooding had loosened the roadbed. The locomotive and two carriages overturned into the river, killing the driver and fireman. Most of the passengers in the front carriages were injured or drowned. A signalman saw the roadbed collapse and ran onto the line to warn the train, but was hit by the train and crushed into pieces. A subsequent telegram states that only one person died and fourteen were injured, four of whom are in critical condition.</p>
<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>Nanchang Telegram to All Newspapers: The people of Jiangxi have suffered from the scourge of the Communist bandits for a long time. In the past, the nation faced many crises, and bandits took advantage of the situation. The central government condemned their crimes and mobilized the entire nation's military to suppress them. The Communist bandits took advantage of the central armies being elsewhere and became even more rampant, engaging in arson, slaughter, and other heinous acts. Jiangxi province has a special situation and has suffered the most. The fields are covered with corpses, and the scenery is bleak. The heavens seem to be weeping. At that time, the local defense forces were weak and spread thin, and their strength was divided. In comparison, they were outnumbered and unable to protect everyone. Repeated telegrams were sent to the central government with pleas for help, but they were unable to do anything due to the circumstances. They had to endure the pain and support the effort. All possible methods to defend were exhausted. The people of Jiangxi cried out for help, suffering greatly for more than half a year. Now that Feng has been defeated and unity has been achieved, the central government is concerned about the suffering of Jiangxi and has dispatched a large army to encircle the bandits by a set deadline. The general offensive began on the 5th of this month. The attacks have been made on the banks of the Gan River and the territory is slowly being retaken. Following the orders of the commander, the troops have met in Ji'an on schedule and are now pursuing the remaining bandits, working to annihilate them and save the people. However, the disaster situation in the recovered areas that have been under Communist control for a long time is so severe that it is unbearable to witness. According to reports from various division and brigade commanders, all that can be seen along the way are ruined walls and rubble, with no clean land. Corpses and severed heads are everywhere. The fields are deserted, with no sound of chickens or dogs. Thousands of villages are desolate, with only rats and foxes to be seen. Those who are fortunate enough to escape the iron hooves of the Red Army are hiding in the mountains, lying exhausted in the wilderness, waiting to die. Those who have fled are homeless in this cold weather. Their families have long become ghosts. Their fields and houses have all been burned to ashes. Dozens of people are dying by the ditches every day. If this continues, the people will be spared from being slaughtered, but they will still be reduced to starvation. Life and death are intertwined. Who is there to help? Where is there to provide food? Everyone has a family, surely there are parents. Who is not saddened by this? Who will donate half of their wealth? Where is there to provide relief? The people are longing for help. It is hoped that you will show compassion and come to our aid with generous funds to save the people. The people of Jiangxi will always be grateful. The Jiangxi Provincial Government pleads.</p>
<p>Jinan Telegram to All Newspapers: We have recently sent a telegram to the National Government stating that Shandong Province has suffered from years of war and drought. It has not had time to recover and has now been hit by war again. This time, the Jin army entered Shandong, claiming to number in the hundreds of thousands. They occupied the area for several months, using reactionary forces to collude with bandits. The countryside has been affected, and there is not a single peaceful place in the province. As a result, after the war, there is little left in the homes of the people. The dead are piled up in the ditches, and the living are hungry and cold. Each county provides supplies to the army, and the amount of money levied per acre is exorbitant. According to county statistics, the amount is over one million for some counties, and at least several hundred thousand for others. In addition, the requisition of civilian houses and the arbitrary taking of property have caused even more losses. The areas where battles were fought and defended have suffered the most damage. The counties are desolate, and there is no means of livelihood. The people are worse off than chickens and dogs, and their lives are lighter than feathers. The wounds have not healed, and they lack food and clothing. Tax collectors are at the door, and there is nowhere to escape. The people's lives are so unfortunate. We deeply understand the government's difficult decision to use force and its desire to alleviate the suffering of the people. We propose that the government issue an order to exempt the most severely affected counties in Shandong Province, such as Tai'an, Qufu, Wenshang, Ningyang, Ziyang, Zhucheng, Ju County, and Liaocheng, from paying taxes for one year. The remaining counties should have their taxes reduced or postponed by the provincial government according to the severity of the disaster. We also request that a large amount of relief funds be allocated to help the affected areas and to subsidize the people's livelihoods. We hope that the government will be compassionate and grant our request. Shandong disaster relief representatives He Chunjiang, He Zhongqi, Zhang Dongcun, Zhao Xinru, Che Baiwen, and Xin Zhujiu.</p>

<h3>Taiyuan After Yan Returns to Wutai</h3>
<p>Citizens Still Uneasy About Airplanes; Jin Army Being Transferred and Replaced; Taiyuan Correspondence – Yan is currently still in his native village of Heshbian in Wutai, and his attitude seems to be not completely negative. Rumors that he is organizing military and political organs in the area are not true. The headquarters has been actively collecting food from counties where troops are not stationed, ranging from 30,000 to over 100,000 per county, to provide assistance. Official documents to various counties still use Yan's name. Yan's headquarters, which had been ordered to be abolished, resumed full operation on the 14th. Postal inspections, which had been suspended for a few days, have also resumed. Regarding the bombing incident, according to the Public Security Bureau's investigation, a total of 32 people have died, 48 were seriously injured, and over 20 were slightly injured. All were male. Although the authorities have officially announced that they received a telegram from Rong Honglu, the garrison commander, stating that Zheng Jing had reached an agreement with He Guoguang and that airplanes would no longer come, instructing all institutions and schools to resume normal operations, defensive measures are still being actively implemented. The general public is still uneasy and fleeing. The value of Jin banknotes has risen from 2.34 yuan to 2.67 yuan in the past two or three days. According to general observations, the prospects for the Jin currency are still not optimistic. In recent days, the authorities have been strictly vigilant against certain factions and those with communist tendencies, arresting several people who are being detained at the Garrison Headquarters. Troops are still being transferred, seemingly for replacement purposes. Liu Guitang's troops, formerly stationed in Yicheng in southern Shanxi, are moving towards the Henan border. On the Zhengtai front, the leading troops of the Shanxi side are stationed in Huailu, and the leading troops of the Feng army are stationed in Jingxing, and the relationship between the two armies is relatively amicable. Wen Shouquan and Liang Ruzhou, the representatives to Feng, returned to Taiyuan tonight and are scheduled to report to Wutai tomorrow morning on the trip, Yan's attitude, and the aftermath of the Jin situation, which will be decided after Wen and Liang meet with Yan (November 16th).</p>
<h3>Situation of Peaceful Negotiations in Guangxi</h3>
<p>Miao Peinan and Ma Xiaojun Conduct Negotiations Separately; Large Fire in Yong City Destroys Dozens of Houses; Guangzhou Correspondence – The war situation in Guangxi Province is still at a stalemate. According to the latest news from the front, the authorities of the Eighth Route Army, for the sake of armed peace, have ordered the front to actively prepare to attack Yong City. Yu Hanmou and Huang Renhuan's units are now concentrated in Binyang, and Li Yangjing's division and Huang Zhiwen's brigade have advanced to Heng County. A few days ago, Liang Hansong's unit of the Guangxi army launched several attacks on the Eighth Route Army's rear in Litang but were repelled. Within Yongning City, there are still about 6,000 Guangxi troops under Wei Yunsong and Huang Xuchu, while Zhang Fakui and Yang Tenghui's units are scattered between Nanning and Tingqiao. Recently, they have also been recruiting local militias to replenish their ranks. The Eighth Route Army had previously sent personnel to negotiate the incorporation of Zhang and Gui's troops. Miao Peinan was appointed as the chief of staff of the Eighth Route Army headquarters, specifically for negotiations with Zhang's army. Ma Xiaojun was sent to recruit the Guangxi army. Miao sent his confidant Wei Rongchao, and Ma sent his nephew Ma Zhanxiong on the 14th, flying to Guixian on the Yingde aircraft, piloted by Xie Cui, for Yong City. It was expected that they would arrive yesterday (18th) to meet with Zhang Fakui and Li Zongren and persuade them to step down for the sake of the situation in Guangxi. On the Eighth Route Army's side, they are very willing to have Zhang's army return. This is because Zhang's unit and the current Eighth Route Army are both descendants of the former Deng Keng First Division. The Eighth Route Army issued the slogan "Reunite the armed comrades of the First Division" during the Chongyang Festival memorial service for the First Division's cemetery. Therefore, the Eighth Route Army will only incorporate Zhang's army if Zhang Fakui personally steps down and Miao Peinan commands all the troops. It is unknown whether Zhang's army will agree to this. According to another source, Zhang himself is very strong and has taken over the command of the units under Chen Zhixin and Han Hanying who were close to Miao Peinan, seemingly with no intention of reconciliation. As for the Guangxi army, Ma Xiaojun sent his nephew to Yong City to negotiate with the Guangxi army generals, but the results are still unknown. One theory is that Li Zongren</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>and Huang Shaoxiong each intend to step down. Bai Chongxi is strongly advocating for not surrendering, believing that the time is not yet ripe. Therefore, there are still signs of war preparations in Wuming, Shanglin, and Nanning. Given this situation, the prospect of peace is still distant. Another theory is that Huang Shaoxiong is very dissatisfied with the internal affairs of the Guangxi army and has resigned and gone to Annam. He has also sent a representative, Chunfu, to Beijing to request that the central government incorporate his unit. Once the negotiations are successful, Huang himself will travel abroad. Amidst this glimmer of peace, a terrible fire suddenly broke out in Nanning City. At 5 a.m. on the 8th, a fire broke out in the Pan Yongping training ground of the Fourth Training Regiment of Li Zongren's unit, destroying the Yongning Third Public School and spreading to at least thirty-five nearby civilian houses and shops. At 8 p.m. on the same day, a fire broke out in a certain organization on Zhonghe Street in the city, affecting neighboring households and burning down twenty-four houses, with a property loss of approximately 100,000. About two hundred refugees were left homeless. This is a tragic disaster amidst the war (November 19th).</p>
<h3>Jinan Telephone Company Appeals Again</h3>
<p>Refusing to accept the debt repayment judgment, Jinan Communications Jinan Telephone Company and Japanese-owned Toyo Takushoku Kabushiki Kaisha were involved in a lawsuit over debt. The telephone company, dissatisfied with the local court's judgment, declared an appeal. The part regarding provisional execution was revoked by the High Court on appeal. The company filed another appeal regarding the part of the local court's order that it be jointly and severally liable for debt repayment and has submitted the appeal brief and attachments. The company's appeal brief and loan contract certificate are recorded below.</p>
<p>Appeal Brief Appellant: Jinan Telephone Company Appellee: Toyo Takushoku Kabushiki Kaisha Regarding the above-mentioned case of debt dispute between the appellant and Toyo Takushoku Kabushiki Kaisha, the appellant, dissatisfied with the judgment of the Jinan Local Court ordering the appellant to be jointly and severally liable for debt repayment, has declared an appeal and paid the litigation fee. Except for the provisional execution part which has been revoked by your esteemed court, the appellant's reasons for disagreeing with the judgment in this case are stated as follows: The reasons for the original judgment ordering the appellant to be responsible for repayment can be summarized as follows: (1) The loan contract certificate submitted by the appellee states that the appellant telephone company bears joint and several guarantee liability. (2) Ma Guanhe's malfeasance is an internal matter and cannot be used against the creditor. Thus, it was determined that the debt should be the responsibility of the appellant telephone company. However, the issue of whether the person who signed the contract with the appellee had such authority, or whether the appellee colluded with Ma Guanhe, was not even considered. To render a judgment that the appellant loses the case, how can this be convincing? According to Article 190 of the Company Law, which was effective at the time of the Republic of China year 10, company bonds could not be raised without a resolution in accordance with Article 199, paragraph 2 of this law. Article 191 states that the total number of company bonds must not exceed the amount of paid-up share capital. Article 199, paragraph 2, stipulates that a special shareholders' meeting can be convened with a majority vote. It is evident that neither the manager nor the board of directors has the authority to borrow large sums of money. Furthermore, according to the Commercial System Regulations, a commercial manager is only responsible for actions within the scope of his business that harm the principal. If the manager acts outside the scope of his authority, and his actions harm the principal, the principal is naturally not responsible. (Refer to Supreme Court Cases 5, Shang, No. 98, and 4, Shang, No. 820). Furthermore, if the creditor colludes with the manager or induces actions that harm the principal, it is still a tort, and the principal cannot be held responsible. This is a fixed and unchangeable legal principle that cannot be doubted. In this case, the loan contract certificate and the amount of the loan submitted by the appellee were never presented to Ma Guanhe for questioning in court. There is no third party to prove whether it is true. For the time being, let's leave aside whether it's true. Just looking at the contract, the borrower is Ma Guanhe and the guarantor is the telephone company. From this point of view, the appellant company is a secondary debtor. Examining the content of the contract, Article 1 states that the loan must be used to expand the business capital of the Jinan Telephone Company, specifically for purchasing telephone machinery and equipment. Article 5 stipulates that the machinery and land of the telephone company are used as collateral. Article 11 states that the guarantor and the borrower are jointly and severally liable. From this point of view, the telephone company is no different from the primary debtor. Regardless of whether the primary debt and the secondary debt are based on such contracts, the telephone company is directly liable for the debt. Therefore, it is necessary to first investigate whether Ma Guanhe had the authority to borrow this money. According to the company's capital at the time, which was only 400,000 yuan (as evidenced by official records), the debt was as high as 440,000 yuan. According to the intention of Article 190 of the Company Law, neither the manager nor the directors have this authority. A creditor who lends such a large sum of money must ensure that the debt is approved by a resolution of the shareholders' meeting before it can be recognized as valid. For example, the actions of a person with limited capacity, beyond the scope of their limitations, cannot take effect without ratification. The appellee and Ma Guanhe signed a loan contract for a large sum of over 400,000 yuan without using a third-party introducer, nor did they ask whether Ma Guanhe had convened a shareholders' meeting to approve it. They secretly dealt with Ma Guanhe personally, had it notarized at their consulate, and did not register it with the Chinese government. It is obvious that they did not want anyone other than Ma Guanhe in China to know about this matter, nor did they want the Chinese government to know about it. From this, it can be concluded that the loan contract of the appellee was definitely not conducted publicly and in good faith. They failed to consider that Ma Guanhe did not have the legal authority to borrow such a large amount exceeding the capital of the telephone company. How can such a large action taken by a person without such authority be legally effective? However, although the substance of the contract is for the telephone company, the name is changed to list the telephone company as a guarantor. The appellee clearly understood the above-mentioned legal principles and deliberately sought to evade them. In essence, there is no difference between the primary debt and the joint and several guarantee. If there is no authority for the primary debt, how can there be the authority to assume joint and several liability for the debt? Ma Guanhe can only represent the telephone company in matters within the scope of the telephone business. However, making himself a joint and several guarantor for a large sum exceeds the scope. According to the aforementioned precedents, the principal of the store cannot be held responsible for actions beyond the scope of business. From this perspective, the appellee's actions appear even more clumsy. The original judgment failed to examine this and instead stated that the appellant could not disclaim responsibility, which is truly incomprehensible. Furthermore, the original judgment's determination that even if Ma Guanhe committed malfeasance, it was an internal matter and could not be used against the creditor is especially erroneous. The law has certain provisions regarding internal and external matters. The Company Law stipulates that large amounts of debt cannot be raised without a resolution of the shareholders' meeting. The spirit of this legislation is very clear. Internally, it restricts the powers of directors and managers. Externally, it restricts creditors of large amounts of money from lending loans indiscriminately. In this case, Ma Guanhe clearly borrowed money without a resolution of the shareholders' meeting. Why can't the telephone company defend against the appellee? Moreover, the director's seals are all false (all denied by letter). It is possible that the appellee and Ma Guanhe colluded and fabricated them. Furthermore, this contract completely disregarded the law. For example, Article 5 states that many of the items listed in the attachments are telephone equipment. According to Article 9 of the then-valid Private Telephone Regulations, if there is a sale or mortgage of a private telephone, it is invalid unless it is first submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval by the parties involved. This is a very serious regulation. Why didn't the appellee submit this collateral to the Ministry of Communications for approval? Their secret actions with Ma Guanhe cannot be justified. It can be inferred that their intention was nothing more than to invade Shandong's electric power industry and claim it as their own. Looking at Article 6 of the contract, which states that in the event of a delay in repaying the principal and interest, the aforementioned collateral may be directly and arbitrarily auctioned off without following the auction law or other legal procedures, it clearly violates the mandatory provisions of the law on security rights. Therefore, they did not want the Chinese government to intervene. Item 9 lists seven stipulations, such as the telephone company having to have the appellee recommend technicians and accountants, and that the establishment of the Shandong Electric Power Unified Society in the future must also borrow capital from them and employ technicians and accountants. Even the operating rights of the telephone business must be consulted with the appellee first. It is increasingly evident that they used the loan to entice Ma Guanhe personally to invade Shandong's electric power industry. In short, the 400,000 yuan loan was an act of secret collusion between the appellee and Ma Guanhe. According to the law, the appellant absolutely cannot be held responsible. Therefore, this supplementary statement of disagreement is submitted, requesting your esteemed court to promptly hear the case, revoke the original judgment, and render a just judgment. This would be a great kindness.</p>

<h3>Details of the Train Robbery Case on the Ping-Sui Railway</h3>
<p>The Northeast Army Will Take Over Defense of the Entire Railway as a Result. A Beiping Dispatch: The diplomatic corps here is paying great attention to the train robbery case on the Ping-Sui Railway, even calling it the "Second Lincheng Incident." According to Qiu Qingchao, Director of the Traffic Department of the railway, Director Zeng Guangxiang is currently in Beijing with Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang and has not yet returned. This major incident occurred at 9:00 AM on the 17th at Guancun Station, which is 64 li away from Pingdiquan Station, separated only by Suji Station, and a little over 100 li east of Fengzhen Station. Pingdiquan and Fengzhen are now garrisoned by considerable Jin troops, but due to political relations, the Jin army is no longer as responsible for protecting traffic and maintaining order as before. In addition, the defeated and retreating troops and bandits have taken the opportunity to run rampant. Over the past month, bridges have been destroyed and telephone poles stolen on the Ping-Sui Railway. This time, an hour before the westbound train arrived at Guancun Station, bandits had already searched the station and emptied all the cash on hand. The stationmaster, train captain, and baggage clerk were detained, and the other railway staff were either driven away or fled. After the train entered the station, over 700 fully armed bandits (including over 100 cavalry) swarmed forward, surrounded the train, and searched the passengers one by one. All the luggage was robbed, lasting for two or three hours. As a result, thirty to forty passengers who were relatively well-dressed were abducted. The stationmaster, train captain, and baggage clerk were also taken away. After receiving the emergency report, the railway bureau, as the incident occurred within the jurisdiction of the Jin army, immediately telegraphed the Jin army to pursue and suppress the bandits. The Jin army cavalry at Pingdiquan immediately mobilized, and the 8th Division of the Jin army from Fengzhen also advanced to pursue. Seeing the army coming to pursue, the bandits released the three abducted railway staff members midway, but treated the passengers as hostages to protect themselves and threatened to kill them all if the army pursued too closely, seemingly demanding ransom. The scene after the bandits left was desolate and chaotic, and the passengers were mostly frightened and bewildered. They勉强 (Mianqiang) opened to Pingdiquan. That night, the railway bureau dispatched the former traffic director Ding Wenqi and the current director of the railway police section, Liang Hu, to the scene to investigate and instructed them to earnestly negotiate with the Jin military authorities west of Datong, demanding serious protection of the western section to prevent unfortunate incidents from happening again. At the same time, they demanded the prompt rescue of the abducted passengers and the large quantities of luggage and valuables. If these two matters are not handled well, many passengers' families will cause trouble for the railway bureau, and the railway bureau will be unable to cope, they said.</p>
<p>When this incident occurred, Yu Xuezhong was in Zhangjiakou. Today (18th), he hurried back to Ping. Tonight, there will be a meeting at the military headquarters, and he will telegraph Zhang Xueliang to report and request instructions on everything. Currently, the most forward unit of the Northeast Army on the Ping-Sui Railway is the 5th Brigade under Dong Yingbin, stationed near Chaigoubao and Tianzhen Station west of Chaigoubao. A few days ago, this 本　(Ben?) attempted to push forward but stopped when Chu Xichun of the Jin side telegraphed requesting that they wait for the Jin army to peacefully hand over the defense. In addition, representatives of Xu Yongchang and Shang Zhen, Lü Xian and Huang Luzhu, also expressed to Yu Xuezhong that the Jin side had no intention of holding onto Suiyuan and requested that they wait for the entire settlement of the Jin army's aftermath before taking over the western section of the Ping-Sui Railway. Now that the train robbery has occurred, the Northeast Army will take over the defense of the entire railway without any further delay. It is estimated that once Zhang Xueliang's reply arrives, the course of action will be seen. According to a certain important person in the military headquarters, after the train robbery occurred, the Northeast Army will, at the very least, take over Pingdiquan and Fengzhen in the Chahar region in order to unify the entire Ping-Sui Railway. The Jin army in the Datong area will also be asked to retreat into Yanmen Pass and cannot assume that because Datong belongs to the Jin territory (Datong on the Ping-Sui Railway is south of Fengzhen), the Jin army should be stationed in the middle section of the railway, obstructing traffic on the entire line, he said.

<h3>Disputes After Revision of the Anhui Rice Tax</h3>
<p>Merchants Go to the Province to Request Exemption from Additional Taxes. A Wuhu Dispatch: The Anhui export rice tax has been decided by the provincial government to cancel the military five-cent surtax and the one-cent road debt fund, and to change the silver to yuan, with the tax rate set at 24 cents per shi of rice and 10 cents for miscellaneous grains. The Fuhu rice merchants believe that this reduction in the original tax rate is very limited, and changing the temporary to permanent, they telegraphed the province to object and requested that the tax be levied at 17 cents. Unexpectedly, the Anhui Rice Tax Bureau received a telegram yesterday from the Qin Finance Department explaining that the so-called cancellation of the surtax only refers to the surtax levied by the province, and that local surtaxes such as education funds should still be levied as before. As a result, the General Chamber of Commerce convened an emergency meeting at 10:00 AM today (20th). They all believed that the rice tax was not only not reduced but actually increased. Moreover, since the newly set tax changes the silver to yuan, the old tax is still levied in silver, making the procedures troublesome. The future of the rice market is hopeless, and various businesses are also suffering a great blow. In addition to immediately telegraphing the Director of the Finance Department, Yuan Jiapu, to appeal for the cancellation of all miscellaneous taxes and surcharges, they also appointed the Chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce, Wu Yu Zhou, standing committee members Yu Ce Qin and Shu Xiang Cheng, Guang Chao, and the members of the Ning rice industry committee, Li Dachu, Lin Aichen, and Zhao Wen, among others, to go to Anqing tomorrow to fight for their case. The telegram sent to the Finance Department is recorded as follows: (Xiao Lei Liang Da) Recently, we received a letter from the rice tax bureau based on a telegram stating that in addition to the regular tax of 24 cents, all local surcharges remain the same. This is inconsistent with the earlier telegram stating that the list of surcharges should be cancelled uniformly. The public is in an uproar. An emergency meeting was held, and it was unanimously agreed that since the previous telegram stated that all surcharges should be cancelled uniformly, it was assumed that local surcharges would be allocated by the provincial tax. Now, the exclusion of local surcharges and continuing to levy them is not considerate. Moreover, the regular tax is levied in yuan, and the attached tax is levied in silver. One tax with two different currencies makes the procedures troublesome. There is no way to do this. In addition to sending representatives to the Yamen to appeal based on the previous telegrams requesting exemption from the five-cent surtax, we also request that the rice tax bureau be telegraphed to continue levying the regular tax in silver to avoid disputes. We are urgently awaiting orders. Wu Yu Zhou, Chairman of the Fuhu General Chamber of Commerce, etc. (knocking) (20th)</p>
<h3>Current Situation and Planned Projects of the Longhai Railway</h3>
<p>A Xuzhou Dispatch: The anti-rebellion military affairs are mostly concentrated on the Longhai Line, so the Longhai Railway has suffered more damage than other railways. Now, Qian Zongze, Director of the Longhai Railway Administration, has submitted a report to the Ministry of Railways on the military situation of the railway, its recent situation, and planned projects. The Ministry of Railways has approved and filed it for implementation. The reports on locomotives, engineering, and traffic are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Locomotive Situation (1) Distribution of Locomotives On February 6 of this year, traffic between Xuzhou and Gui was first disrupted. There were only three locomotives that could run on the eastern section. After negotiations with various armies, three locomotives that had been recovered and were being repaired. At that time, we relied on only a few locomotives to maintain military transportation and passenger and freight traffic on the 280+ kilometers between 　 and the sea. From March 7 to March 19, traffic between Xuzhou and Zhengzhou was temporarily open, but it was very short-lived and was disrupted again. At that time, two locomotives that had come from the western section were blocked on the eastern section. Combined with the original three locomotives and the three that had been repaired, the number increased to eight. As a result, traffic between 　 and the sea was easier to maintain than before. After the rebellion in Haizhou was resolved, three more locomotives were recovered. When the Han army passed through Xuzhou, three more locomotives were allocated after negotiations. When the Shi army went west, they planned to detain one locomotive. Afterwards, we telegraphed various armies one after another and personally negotiated to recover four locomotives. At the same time, we also recovered two locomotives that had been abandoned and in disrepair from the Jinpu Railway and refurbished them. After much effort, we managed to put together more than ten locomotives to cope with military transportation and take care of railway affairs, and we were fortunate not to miss the opportunity and勉爲 (Mianwei) to疏通 (Shu Tong) the freight transport. (2) Repair Situation and Material Preparation The railway's main repair plant is located far away at Luoyang West Station, while the scale of the Tongshan Locomotive Plant is only a relatively complete locomotive shop with incomplete equipment and a lack of materials. Usually, the repair of various parts and components must be transported to the Luoyang plant. Since traffic was disrupted, all the large and small repair work of all locomotives relied on the Tongshan plant. Fortunately, the copper, iron, tin, and other materials shipped from Europe this spring were retained at the Dapu Port in advance and not immediately transported to the Luoyang plant, so they could be used temporarily. At the same time, we hired more craftsmen to rush repairs day and night, so the work was not delayed. (3) Addition of Machinery The equipment in the Tongshan Locomotive Plant is extremely simple, so it is difficult to speed up work, and military transport does not allow 绥 (Sui). After many calculations, we purchased one ten-foot and one eleven-foot lathe, one new-style washing machine, and added 　 and tool rests to the 　 有略大 (You Lüe Da) 　床 (Chuang) so that both ends could work simultaneously. Therefore, although there was little machinery, the repair of many locomotives was勉爲 (Mianwei) to cope with. (4) Planned Projects The Tongshan Plant is close to the coast in the east and Pukou in the south, making it more convenient to store and unload materials. If it can be expanded, it will not be necessary to rely solely on the Luoyang plant to assemble new cars in the future, which can save the labor of long-distance transportation. Moreover, with the completion of the Haizhou Port project, the various repair work in the eastern section is even closer. In the future, we plan to add machinery and equipment gradually and expand the plant according to the economic situation. In normal times, both the eastern and western plants can carry out nearby repairs, and in case of an emergency, there will not be a lack of various items. Furthermore, traffic has now been restored in Kaifeng and Lingbao. The water towers in the factories in this section are still intact. However, Kaifeng has only one shunting locomotive, Zhengzhou has two shunting locomotives, five long-distance locomotives, and four locomotives under repair at the Luoyang West Plant. However, many of the long-distance locomotives are currently occupied by the military and have not yet been returned. The remaining locomotives were all driven to the northern and southern sections of Pinghan by the rebel army and cannot be recovered for the time being. The materials in each factory are extremely lacking and have been slightly replenished for repairs.</p>

<h3>Qing Dynasty Vehicles from the Jinpu and Longhai Railways</h3>
<p>The Jinpu Railway has dispatched personnel to Xuzhou to discuss the matter. A Pukou Dispatch: During the anti-rebellion military uprising, the Central Army focused on the Jinpu and Longhai Railways. In February of this year, the Chief Error Correction Department appointed Qian Zongze, Director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, to concurrently serve as the Transport Commander of the Longhai and Jinpu Railways. On February 23, the headquarters was established in Xuzhou to allocate locomotives and vehicles from both railways for military transport. Sun Hegao, Director of the Jinpu Railway Bureau, believing in the importance of the anti-rebellion military affairs, not only provided all the vehicles on the line for military use but also rushed to repair all the damaged locomotives and vehicles in the Puji factories. At the same time, he borrowed vehicles from various railways to maintain the first and second-class passenger trains. All other passenger and freight transport was suspended. As a result, the income of the Jinpu Railway was greatly reduced. The staff and material costs were borrowed from the east and west, and only勉渡 (Mian Du) the difficulties. When the anti-rebellion army triumphed, the Commander-in-Chief instructed that the military transport headquarters of each railway should be revoked by November 15 and ordered each army to return all the seized vehicles to the respective railway bureaus by the date of the document. Afterwards, if there are large-scale military transport by each railway, the Traffic Department will temporarily notify the railway bureau to prepare the vehicles. It has been found that the Jinpu Railway has allocated a total of twenty-eight trains for military transport, all with vehicle numbers and track crossing documents to prove it. Now that the headquarters has been revoked, the vehicles should be returned to the Jinpu Railway in accordance with the original vehicle numbers and numbers. However, the Jinpu Railway has not yet returned twenty-three locomotives and twenty-five trains totaling more than five hundred and sixty vehicles. As a result, the Jinpu Railway is unable to maintain passenger transport and scattered military transport. The railway bureau's Beijing-Liaoning through train is about to be implemented, and the vehicles are even more insufficient. It is hoped that the Longhai Railway will return all the originally allocated vehicles. Now, the Director of the Traffic Department, She, and others have been sent to Xuzhou to discuss the method of allocating vehicles. (Wuchen News Agency)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Changing of Patrol Officers and Strict Prohibition of Rumors. Zhu Ying, Director of the County Public Security Bureau, has been ordered to be promoted and transferred to the post of Director of the Huaiyin Public Security Bureau and is currently instructing the department to expedite the handover. However, Patrol Officer Chen of the First District, 13th Sub-Precinct and Patrol Officer Li Bingkui of the 15th Sub-Precinct have both resigned. Director Zhu immediately transferred Inspector Lu Zhongyu to fill the post of the First District and appointed Zhang Baoyuan, a local resident, to succeed him at Xiaokunshan, replacing Patrol Officer Chen of the 13th Sub-Precinct. Fei Yilin was sent to Caojing to succeed Patrol Officer of the 15th Sub-Precinct. Orders have been issued for the respective replacements. In addition, a public notice has been issued to all sectors of society, sincerely fearing that unscrupulous people will spread rumors or create trouble on the occasion of the Director's change of office, which is detrimental to reputation. In addition to sending personnel to investigate at any time, if all sectors encounter such illegal elements, it is hoped that they will immediately report them for punishment.</p>
<p>Agricultural Bank Opens Agricultural Product Mortgage. The county's Farmers Bank branch has received instructions from the provincial branch to open a warehouse for agricultural product mortgages in order to provide farmers with the convenience of borrowing funds without having to sell their products urgently. Under the planning of Li Jiannong, who is in charge, it will be launched at Huayang Bridge in the eastern suburbs at the beginning of next month. It is reported that the standard for collateral is calculated at 70% of the market value of the collateral, and the procedures are very simple. The interest rate is also levied.</p>

<p>Guerrilla Team Opens Fire with Lake Bandits: The guerrilla team stationed at the south treasury town of Wujiang County, led by Team Leader Fang, encountered several bandit boats suddenly on the evening of the 21st. Team Leader Fang immediately directed the team to surround the bandit boats, and the bandits opened fire. Team Leader Fang then ordered the team members to return fire, which lasted for an hour. The bandits, unable to withstand the force, fled. One bandit boat was shot down, and one hostage was rescued.</p>
<p>Military Police Inspection Office Abolished: Chiang Hsiao-hsien, the commander of the 4th Regiment of the Garrison in Suzhou, has been relieved of his post as the military operations in the area have concluded. All the wounded soldiers in the 15th and 17th rear hospitals in Suzhou have recovered and returned to their units. There is no longer a need for the military police inspection office in Suzhou. After reporting to the Commander of the Three Provinces Bandit Suppression, the office has been abolished to save public funds. Commander Xiong, based on the report, issued orders yesterday (the 20th) to the military and police agencies to allow the abolition.</p>
<p>Hengjing: Robbery and Assault: Seven or eight bandits suddenly arrived at the home of Niu Shaoqiu, a villager in the northeast Fu Township of Hengjing Township in the county on the evening of the 21st. They robbed approximately one hundred yuan worth of clothing and assaulted Niu and his wife, Wu.</p>
<p>Hostage Dies of Illness in Robbery Case: During the robbery of the Dongshan Flying Tiger and Continental ferries by a large gang of lake bandits in July, over thirty hostages were taken. The former District Chief of the Third Water Public Security District personally led a team to engage the bandits in the Nanku Huangjiazao area, rescuing over twenty hostages. However, three hostages, Shi Jiesan and two surnamed Shen, had not yet been rescued. It is now known that after being attacked by the water police, the gang of bandits took Shi Jiesan and the other hostages to the Lusi area of Nantong. They sent people to Dongshan to negotiate ransom terms with the families of the hostages. They demanded 5,000 yuan for Shi Jiesan and 50,000 yuan for the Shen hostage. The Shen family agreed to pay 30,000 yuan for the ransom, while the Shi family was unable to raise the funds in time and had to temporarily postpone the negotiations. Later, the gang of bandits was defeated by the provincial security army in Nantong. The bandits fled with the hostages until the 18th of this month when bandits were sent to Dongshan to inform the Shi family that Shi Jiesan had died of illness this month. The bandits, now on the run, used salt to preserve the corpse to prevent decomposition and offered to return the body for a price for burial. The Shi family was saddened upon hearing the news and held a memorial service on the 19th. As for the Shen hostage, the gang of bandits suffered severe losses in Nantong, and the ransom price has risen to 80,000 yuan. The Shen family has agreed to pay 50,000 yuan for the ransom, but has not yet gone to the bandit's den to redeem the hostage.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Bandits Kidnap and Demand Huge Ransom: Chen Weigao, a resident of Zhouzhuang Town on the border of Wuxi and Cheng, is about fifty years old. He is an honest man with several children and a modest family fortune. He has been running the Chen Yanghe Pharmacy in the town for decades with good business. Recently, Chen Weigao took a boat from the town to Wuxi and then went to Yixing, Jintan, and other places to visit relatives. On his way back, he was suddenly kidnapped by several bandits in Nanduzhen, Yixing County. Yesterday afternoon, around 2:00 pm, Chen's family received a letter from the bandits stating that they should quickly raise a large sum of money and come to a certain place to negotiate the ransom. After receiving the letter, Chen's family was shocked and immediately began searching, but the bandits were nowhere to be found, and the whereabouts of the hostage are unknown.</p>
<p>Feast Donation to Maintain Original Plan: The case of the Yixian County Education Bureau organizing a feast donation to supplement educational funds has been decided by the provincial government to be implemented. Recently, Wang Juting and others, representatives of the Dixinlou Restaurant in the county, expressed their opposition and filed an appeal to the provincial government. After being rejected by the provincial government, they filed another appeal to the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, declaring their dissatisfaction and requesting an abandonment of the measure. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Finance carefully reviewed the case and decided to maintain the original plan for the feast donation. Yesterday, it instructed the Yixian County government to comply.</p>
<p>Large Fire Erupts at Gongyun Bridge: The buildings at Gongyun Bridge outside Guangfu Gate in the three counties, from Tonghui Road to the Dayou Warehouse along the river, originally belonged to Sheng Xingxun and were later mortgaged to the Enterprise Company for management and rented to various businesses. Yesterday afternoon, at 2:30 pm, a fire suddenly broke out in the Zhu household (some say it was the Shengping Tea House) on the upper floor of a bicycle shop along the river. In an instant, thick smoke billowed, piercing the roof, and the flames were raging and unapproachable. Alarms were immediately sounded, and firefighters from various sections arrived at the scene one after another to bravely put out the fire. However, at that time, the strong wind made it difficult to extinguish the flames. It took two hours to extinguish the fire. The fire destroyed the Dafei Bicycle Shop, Tongda Transportation Company, Jisheng (Yangxian) Shipping Bureau, Jiaotong Hotel, Saifei Bicycle Shop, Tongyi Transportation Company, Weiyuji Silk Shop, Yongtai Transport Company, Shengping Tea House, Xindexing Grocery Store, Yuanyou Medicine Store, Jinji Yongchang Barber Shop, Chen Xuxing Shop, Hengxiang Silk Cocoon Shop, Yuanchia Company, Zhang Yixing Restaurant, and Xichang Cigarette and Paper Shop, a total of nineteen buildings with thirty-four rooms. The total loss is estimated to be fifty to sixty thousand yuan. During the fire, Wu, a member of the No. 11 section of the North District Security Fire Brigade, accidentally crushed his right middle finger while extinguishing the fire. It was also reported that a female patient at the Jiaotong Hotel suddenly went missing. It is currently being investigated whether she perished in the fire.</p>
<p>Yongtai Silk Factory Strikes Again: The Yongtai Silk Factory near Zhizu Bridge outside the South Gate of this county has 408 silk reeling machines and over 800 female workers. The silk machines are located upstairs and downstairs. On the 20th, the factory paid wages with silver coins and small bills. Because there was no change, they used small silver coins with an added premium. Unexpectedly, all 300 workers upstairs were dissatisfied because the wages were short in silver coins, and the National Day wages had not yet been paid. They also felt that the fines this month were too high. They planned a response, and yesterday afternoon, all the workers went on strike. Upon seeing this, the factory immediately called the third branch of the Public Security Bureau. Upon receiving the report, officer Li Shipin immediately led police officers to the factory to maintain order. The workers elected You Erjie, Sun Jinjie, and Mei Zhaodi as representatives to question the factory. Manager Xue Runpei came forward to persuade them, stating that the National Day wages had not been paid by all factories, and this factory could not be an exception. The four representatives did not accept this explanation and went to the Workers' Association to meet with committee members Xie Bin and Wang Zijing to demand justice, but without any results. Therefore, the workers have not yet returned to work. The county party department is actively mediating.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Rob Prisoner and Kill Guard: The police team stationed in Weicun, Wuyi County, recently arrested Han Fusheng, a notorious bandit. On the 20th, six guards were dispatched to escort the prisoner to the city. Near Xuejia Bridge, a group of bandits ambushed and robbed Han. They shot and killed guard Yang Ying and stripped him of his uniform. The body was found lying in the field. On the 21st, the victim's family prepared a coffin for burial and awaited inspection and investigation by Chen Tianxi, the captain of the police brigade.</p>
<p>Tenant Kidnapped and Murdered by Bandits: Lu Depei, who lived in Lujiatang near Dingyanzhen in the eastern suburbs of Wuyi County, received threatening letters from kidnappers but did not negotiate. Subsequently, Lu’s tenant, Xiaogen, was mistakenly kidnapped, and a ransom of 8,000 yuan was demanded. Lu Depei only offered 300 yuan. The bandits refused and kidnapped Xiaogen to Disu Bridge on the night of the 19th, shot him, stabbed his head, and abandoned the body. Afterwards, the deceased’s brother took the body to the home of the landlord, Lu Depei, on the 21st. Lu prepared a coffin for burial and paid condolences, which were taken back to Jiangyin for burial.</p>
<p>Villager Shot and Killed by Bandits on the Road: Zhang Genzhao, a resident of Dingyan Bridge in Wuyi County, worked as a machinist in Shanghai. He recently returned to Changzhou from Shanghai. On the evening of the 19th, he came to the city on business. Near the railway in Sanguantang, he was ambushed and assassinated by bandits, who shot him several times, killing him. On the 20th, the victim's family prepared a coffin for burial. The case has spread far and wide, but as of today (the 22nd), the case has not been reported.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Banditry Suppressed in East and West Townships: Banditry in the eastern and western townships of Nantong has been rampant since last winter. After joint military and police operations, bandit leaders such as Tang Chuyun, Chou Hengzhong, Chen Sipangzi, Yu Haiqing, and Feng have been killed, and over 700 bandits have surrendered. The situation has now been stabilized, and the cleanup is continuing with joint military and police efforts on land and water.</p>
<p>Sea Bandits: Sea bandits are becoming increasingly rampant in Lusi Market, Nantong, and Da'an Port, Haimen. The military and police have been dispatched to assist. The bandits are relying on shallow waters for cover. The Fourth District Headquarters of the Wusong Water Police has sent police ships to blockade the area and has telegraphed the General Headquarters to dispatch seaplanes for assistance.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>Petition to Collect Business Registration Fee for Education: The Education Bureau of Rugao County reports that the county's education funds have been severely strained due to recent tax revenue shortages. Even with extreme reductions in spending, they are still insufficient to meet needs. Compulsory education urgently needs development, and social education facilities also need to be expanded. Although the education land tax has not exceeded the quota, the farmers' vitality has not yet recovered due to the recent banditry. It is also impossible to increase the tax again. Overdue fines are now entirely retained by the province. All of these factors require urgently finding new sources of funding to remedy the situation. They have submitted a petition to the Education Department requesting that it be forwarded to the Provincial Government to approve the collection of 30% of the recently decided business registration fee for education funding. The collection of 30% of this business registration fee will not be too burdensome for merchants, but it will significantly increase education revenue. It is reported that education bureaus in other counties, such as Nantong, have also submitted similar requests.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Yongshengxiang Shop Assistant Flees with Money: Sheng Naichang, a shop assistant at the Yongshengxiang Lu Chen shop outside the South Gate of this city, suddenly fled last night (the 19th) with 640 yuan. Zhu Bingshan, the owner of the shop, has sent people to Sanxian Town to search for him and is negotiating with his guarantor, Ge Xiangchen.</p>
<p>Bixia Palace Suffers Fire Robbery: The Bixia Palace in Shibao Town, which was built in the Tang Dynasty and is magnificent, was destroyed by fire at 7:00 pm on the 17th. Although the town's fire brigade arrived to put out the fire, the wind fueled the flames, and the fire continued for seven hours. The loss is said to be significant.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Yu Sui Rice Shop Fine Issue: Yu Sui Rice Shop, located outside the North Gate of Jiaxing, was reported for violating the rice price evaluation committee's fixed price by someone. The Party and government organs then forwarded the case to the county government. After confirming the facts, the county government imposed a fine of 500 yuan, to be used for accumulating grain storage funds. The shop delayed payment, and recently, the county magistrate ordered the county public security bureau to strictly pursue collection of the fine. It is now known that the shop is lobbying in various ways and has prepared 160 yuan to be transferred through the Rice Industry Registration Office on the 21st and requested that the remaining amount be waived. It is unknown whether the county government will approve this request.</p>
<p>Legal Representative Election for Property Custody Committee: The term of the first County Property Custody Committee in Jiaxing is about to expire. The county government convened representatives from various legal groups on the previous day to elect members in accordance with regulations for submission to the province for approval. It is understood that representatives from the Party, agriculture, industry, commerce, education, women, and other legal groups attended the meeting and elected fourteen people in accordance with regulations. Zhu Lisan, Lu Zhitang, Chen Naihe, Shen Yijun, Jiang Weixian, and others were elected. The county has informed the elected members to submit their detailed resumes for review.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Construction Department Resolves Fish Waterway Dispute in Fengpei: The waterway spanning Feng County and Pei County in Jiangsu Province and Yutai County in Shandong Province has no designated management area, and has not been dredged for decades. Last month, administrative personnel from the three counties held a joint meeting to discuss dredging methods, and all disputes have been resolved. However, the Construction Department recently received a report from Li Daoyi and other residents of Feng County regarding the fish waterway dispute in Fengpei. The department immediately forwarded the report to the provincial government and requested that it be forwarded to the Shandong Provincial Government to urge Yutai County to earnestly implement the previous meeting's methods of the three counties to avoid disputes.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Police Officer Beaten While Seizing Opium: Patrol officers from the Second Branch of the Guazhou Public Security Bureau in this county discovered that Ji Dezhu was privately operating an opium den and allowing people to consume opium in Huo Jiaqiao. They went to search and arrested six opium addicts on the spot: Yao Kailong, Xu Rushang, Xu Yufa, Jin Youqiu, Tang Shaokui, and Wang Chengrong, as well as opium paraphernalia. The opium den owner, Ji Dezhu, had already fled upon hearing the news. Because it was already dark, the officers did not bring them back to the station and instead housed all the arrested opium addicts in the Datong Hotel in the town. Shortly after, there were rumors of a disturbance outside. The patrol officers sent one officer in plainclothes with the seized evidence to the Guazhou Branch Bureau and reported to Branch Chief Yan Yu, unaware that the arrested opium addicts had already been snatched away by Wang Sizi and others from the town. The guards had been beaten. Upon receiving the report, Branch Chief Yan came to the city to report the incident to the Public Security Bureau Chief, who appointed Inspector Liao to lead a group of armed police officers to investigate and arrest the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Qian Kangxiang Bank Closes Again: After the collapse of the Zizhi Longshen two banks in the Yangzhou financial community, this street's official notes became unusually tight. Yesterday (20th), Qian Kangxiang Bank, located at the Changfu Lane entrance, and its rice shop branch in Xiaodongmen also collapsed. It is said that Qian Kangxiang Bank was owed 50,000 taels by the Qianyuan Power Plant. It is reported that after the bank's closure, it owes 13,500 taels of official notes from this street, 6,000 taels of Zhenjiang currency to a Zhenjiang peer, and over 40,000 taels in deposits to a certain bank. In addition, there are many depositors, and the shop's assets are insufficient to cover the debts.</p>
<h3>Xuzhou</h3>
<p>County Chamber of Commerce Elects Executive and Supervisory Committee Members: The Tongshan County Chamber of Commerce was ordered to reorganize. Feng Yu and Cheng Ruhe, officials from the Provincial Office, came to Xuzhou to organize the elections on the previous day. The elections were held yesterday. Today, the meeting was held in the county hall. Gai Bohua, Cao Zifan, Yu Jianhai, Zhang Shaotang, Liu Yusheng, and fifteen others were elected as executive committee members. Liu Chengxiang, Jing Chi'an, Feng Xianqing, Wang Yizhi, and seven others were elected as supervisory committee members.</p>
<p>Two Assassination Cases: In the Eleventh District of Wang He Township, a female corpse with knife wounds was found in a mountain crevice. Yesterday, the district chief reported to the county government, and officials have been dispatched to investigate. In addition, Sun Baoxin and other residents of the city's East Railway Station secretly reported that a civilian defense corps assassinated Xia Laowu (Xia Dengju) on the previous day. The corps arrested Xia and sent him to the County Police Brigade for questioning. Xia confessed that he had strangled Zheng Yu to death with a rope in his home. The person was an adjutant, but he did not know his name. He searched the adjutant's body for 135 yuan and gave the reporter 10 yuan. The body was buried in a public cemetery. A document has been prepared to transfer Xia to the county government for questioning.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>The proposal for widespread education, academic awards, and national construction fundamentals passed by the Fourth Plenary Session.</h3>
<p>Committee Member Zhu Jiahua's proposal (widespread education, academic awards, and national construction fundamentals) was passed by the Fourth Plenary Session according to the education team's review opinions, and handed over to the National Government to instruct the educational institutions to consider handling it. The original text of the proposal is recorded below. Since the adoption of the educational purpose and its implementation policy by the Third National Congress of our party, although the Central Executive Committee of this session has repeatedly made proposals on education in various meetings, due to the betrayal of warlords and the frequent rise of military affairs, the original policies could not be implemented. It is painful to say. Now, when the country is unified and the people are renewed, our party should establish the foundation of education in the shortest possible time, so as to gradually realize the original policies, so that the fundamentals of national construction can be established and the training and political tasks can be completed. Therefore, the following proposals are made and respectfully requested for public decision.</p>
<h3>(A) Widespread Education</h3>
<p>1.  The regulations for compulsory education in various countries are limited to elementary school because the people's living standards are uneven, and most people cannot afford to provide education for their children until they graduate from middle school. Although the United States has gradually approached the trend of university education, compulsory education is still limited to elementary school. With the progress of civilization, elementary school education cannot meet the needs. Therefore, Germany first created compulsory education after graduating from elementary school, adding remedial education for a limited number of years. After its implementation, it has been very effective, and various countries have competed to imitate it. Initially, the age was limited to 14, and then it was gradually increased. Some states in the United States have increased it to 22 years old. The curriculum has also changed from simple to complex, allowing people to specialize in a field. The advanced remedial education in the United Kingdom is equivalent to the first year of university. The detailed classification of various countries is no less than thousands of species. The progress of agriculture, industry, and commerce in Europe and the United States relies on the inventions of scholars, but it also depends on practitioners having sufficient knowledge to implement them. The low level of the Chinese people is still like a plate of loose sand. Affected by world traffic, agriculture, industry, and commerce have all gone bankrupt, and the people's livelihood is increasingly difficult, leading to the prevalence of thieves and the Communist Party taking the opportunity to incite chaos. The disaster of collapse is not in foreign troubles but in itself. Now, in addition to striving to popularize education to achieve the purpose of not having out-of-school children, we must also work hard to treat the symptoms and run remedial education. The young and middle-aged people in the country are all ignorant and ignorant. To stabilize society, it is like seeking fish from trees. It is not only impossible to achieve, but it is also in vain. The plan for now should be to include remedial education as compulsory education in order to popularize it. All men and women under the age of 50 who are illiterate should be required to enroll in school in stages, and those who are far away will be punished.</p>
<p>2.  The compilation of the curriculum and the teaching time limit are two hours each week, and must not be increased or decreased. Increasing it will make it difficult for laborers to persist, and decreasing it will have little effect. The course content includes Party principles and civic common sense in Chinese, accounting for half of the time. The remainder is arithmetic, and the propositions and answers are inserted into the illustrations to teach it. It not only increases interest but also increases skills. Germany's initial creation of remedial education was also based on two hours twice a week.</p>
<p>3.  The estimate of expenses is that the total population of the country is about 400 million. After deducting half of the elderly, young children, each class is calculated at 50 people, about 4 million classes. Each classroom teaches 6 classes a day, requiring about 100,000 classrooms. Each classroom is served by two teachers, requiring about 400,000 people. The teacher's salary and miscellaneous expenses are 300 yuan per classroom per year, which is only 60 million yuan. There are 300 million laborers in the country, and each person bears 20 cents of silver each year, which is a very cheap price.</p>
<p>4.  The teachers are recruited from rural teachers and unemployed people who are literate. After short-term training, they can be trained. In addition, each year during the busy farming season, they will be convened for testing to increase their knowledge and skills. There is no worry that they will not be able to do the job and will be given continued service guarantees and seniority pay to encourage their interest and strengthen their careers. As for training these teachers, each training institution is divided into several classes with 50 to 200 people per class. The total number of training institutions in the country is only about a thousand. Each large county has one, and small counties jointly set one up. Then the selection of teachers to train these teachers and the equipment of the training institutions are not difficult.</p>
<p>The above measures are requested to be stipulated by the central government, and the local administrative authorities of each province are responsible for promoting them within the time limit. Those who exceed the time limit or fail to implement them in accordance with the outline will be severely punished. The central and provincial education administrative organs should send people to inspect at any time, and the achievements of educational development will be the basis for the examination of local administrative personnel.</p>
<h3>(B) Award Academic Scholarship</h3>
<p>1.  The reward of writing, Japan's Meiji Restoration, has been decades, and the new books of English, German, and French have not been translated into national languages, and writing has also increased day by day. The society has made great progress, and there is no problem in the world's academic research that no Japanese have participated in. The world's academic magazines often have papers or reports published by Japanese people, the international academic status has increased, and the national status has also increased. The progress of the ancient and modern texts. Looking back at China, it has disappeared, and it is the same as South America, Africa, and India. If you do not work hard to plan, how can you stand in the country? Today's strength is the strength of science. Whether it is politics, military affairs, diplomacy, agriculture, industry, and commerce, there is no way to compete without science, that is, there is no way to survive. If we want to seek freedom and equality for our country and preserve the nation forever, we must strive for the glory of the whole world. People must all engage in academics. If we want to popularize academics, we must reward the writings of the people. It is intended to designate 50 million yuan each year. All writings can be submitted to the Ministry of Education and submitted to the Central Research Institute or the National University Professor Council for review. The quality will be rewarded.</p>
<p>2.  The library and research room of academic research are also dependent on joint research and mutual discussion. Although the scholars of the same level each study a small problem, they must each have an invention that is more extensive than those who are not specialized, and they must have special progress. If the library is richer and the talents are more concentrated in the national universities, the professors with higher levels are ordered to devote themselves to research, then it is convenient to read the library and research room, and they can also teach the university students with their gains, which is better than the independent research of other people. There are many benefits to those who have insights and wait for maturity and completeness before making them public. It is intended to designate a special amount of 500,000 to 1 million yuan as research subsidies and bonuses. Each national university estimates the candidates twice a year and submits them to the Ministry of Education for a decision. In addition to the original budget regulations of each school, special sub-items are subsidized to encourage them. It must be effective in ten years.</p>
<p>3.  Sending students abroad. Our country always selects young students who do not have a deep understanding of national conditions or have matters to be resolved. Most of them stay abroad for ten years or less. The subjects learned are followed by their interests and are not closely related to the needs of the country. They return home and do not engage in this. There is no matter arising from this, it is in vain to waste effort and money. The money spent on learning is not used and is meaningless. Examining the countries of Europe and the United States, and even neighboring Japan, the selected candidates are not university professors, teaching assistants, or factory technicians, who have accumulated a number of problems to be solved before studying abroad. The time limit may be long or short, and they must return with the goal to get the benefits. Therefore, the cost is small and the effect is great. The cost is also many times higher than the study abroad fee in our country to proceed smoothly and get the greatest benefit in the shortest period of time. If necessary, the same time and day are divided into several times, although the cost is the same, the difference in gains cannot be counted in daoli. In the past, there were very few universities and factories in the country, and it was not possible to select young students. In the future, it is intended to designate special problems according to the needs of various places and select talents who have been researching and have achieved achievements. Send them out annually to train them. Proposer: Zhu Jiahua Co-signer: Chen Lifu</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education refutes the request of the principals of the Soviet province to issue a guarantee law.</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department that sixteen people, including Ren Zhongmin, the principal of the provincial secondary school, stated that (education is the lifeline of the country, and the seriousness of its responsibility lies entirely on the shoulders of educators, and whether educators are at ease or not is really related to the good things of education. However, in recent years, educators have not only been burdened with difficult tasks and meager treatment, but their lives, reputations, and positions have not been effectively guaranteed. They often suffer humiliation, slander, and framing. As in the case of the Yancheng Middle School robbery last year, teachers and staff were beaten, and this year, Xiao Mingqin, the principal of Suqian Middle School, was beaten and slandered. This kind of situation has been seen repeatedly. The principals have witnessed the danger in their hearts. If this continues, how can personal life be guaranteed? How can the education cause be maintained? How can the party and national laws be rectified? What about the dignity of education and the personality of teachers? Therefore, there is no way to guarantee that we will be able to make mistakes. We are especially solemnly requesting Jun Ting to inspect and forward it to the Ministry of Education to quickly issue a method for guaranteeing the personnel of education in order to maintain education and guarantee the actual convenience). According to this, in addition to the instructions, we should also report the situation and ask Jun Ting to inspect and instruct us to follow the instructions. Yesterday, the Ministry of Education instructed the Ting Yun Cheng Xi. The Ministry had previously reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Secondary School Joint Association Standing Committee Wang Maozu, etc., requesting the formulation of the educational staff guarantee laws and regulations. The Ministry did not approve it and did not reply to it. The personnel in this item should be protected by the law like ordinary civil servants and people. It is not necessary to present special laws and regulations. The place where you are requesting to issue the educational personnel guarantee method should be ignored. You should know and notify this order.</p>

As a result, it ended in a 1-1 draw.</p>
<h3>Zhenru Fought Desperately</h3>
<p>Lost 0-2 to Huasesi, the reason for the defeat was that Dai Linjing did not play. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Zhenru football team played against Huasesi in the Western Association's Group A match at the China Baseball Field. About four to five thousand spectators watched. Zhenru fought desperately but ultimately lost 0-2. The referee was Lenos. A brief description is as follows:</p>
<h3>Lineups of the Two Teams</h3>
<p>Zhenru Team: Chen Juxiang, Feng Yunyou, Lin Songfa, Fu He, Jiang Liangguanlian, Chen Zhenhe, Chen Jiaqiu, Jiang Shanqing, Zhuang Shihong, Yang Maosen, Tong Rongwen.</p>
<p>Huasesi: Tang Si, Pu Tuo, Dai Luberte, Phillips, Hawkins, Lang Shi, Yige Dun, Shi Tang Lei, Xiao Shi, Mudis.</p>
<h3>Zhenru Performed to the Best of Their Ability</h3>
<p>Huasesi is one of the strongest teams in Shanghai. In the preliminary round of the Skotto Cup, they eliminated Howard. However, Zhenru is not a weak team either, so yesterday's match was considered a close contest, and the outcome could not be predicted. Unfortunately, center Dai's foot injury had not healed, and he could not play, which greatly weakened the strength of the forward line. Mei Hongfan was also absent due to other matters, so even though there were opportunities to attack, there was a lack of power to score, which was a pity. However, the strength of the defense is well-known. Liang Guanlian's goalkeeping and Jiang Shanqing's right defense often had outstanding performances. Chen Zhenhe, as the central defender, worked hard to direct the left and right. It is a pity that the team members often wanted to take care of both the front and the back, which made them exhausted. However, overall, the team was beautiful and good. Although Zhenru lost, they had done their best and had nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<h3>Although the Attack Was Strong, Many Opportunities Were Missed</h3>
<p>As soon as the whistle sounded, the athletes competed. Yang Bingxiang advanced from the left corner, and Tong Rongwen advanced from the right, but both were unsuccessful. Zhenru used an extremely solid defensive line to allow the forwards to focus on attacking. The ball often revolved in the Huasesi territory, but it was often lost due to delay or due to a single person fighting alone without assistance. The attacks were abandoned.</p>
<h3>Turning Danger into Safety, Hoping for Misfortune to Turn into Blessing</h3>
<p>The enemy's attacks were fierce and they counterattacked desperately. As a result, dangerous situations arose one after another. Lang and Ershi attacked with all their might, and when they reached the Zhenru goal, the inner defenders accidentally committed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick. Lang Shi stood up to kick, and the audience was worried about Zhenru. Unexpectedly, the ball flew straight in, but Liang Guanlian slapped it out. Although it became a corner kick, the enemy soldiers could do nothing. Then, Lang Shi attacked again, but was also saved by Liang. Everyone thought that danger had been turned into safety and that Zhenru would enter a happy state. The first half ended with no achievements.</p>
<h3>The Momentum Gradually Declined, and Disaster Struck</h3>
<p>Watching the efforts of Zhenru's attacks in the first half ultimately came to nothing. Fortunately, the defense was strong and the enemy was unable to succeed, resulting in a draw. However, viewers were generally worried about whether the second half could be as brave and unstoppable as before. As expected, the formation changed and the military situation was different. Chen Bingxiang circled left and right but did not achieve anything. Instead, he saw the enemy's fierce attacks coming from both sides. Tang Si attacked, and Liang Guanlian fell to the ground to save it. Chen Jiaqiu then broke through the enemy's formation to the goal but was blocked again. Heaven did not bless them. When Tong Rongwen was attacking, the ball rebounded and hit him on the head, causing him to faint. Fortunately, he recovered quickly, and everyone applauded. Unexpectedly, when the formation was incomplete and the spirit was declining, Lang Shi raised his foot and attacked, and the ball was unsavable. There were only fifteen minutes left in the game. Misfortune never comes singly. The enemy got a corner kick, Xiao Shi got it and attacked, but the ball did not go in. Lang Shi raised his foot and sealed the victory. Although Zhenru tried their best to counterattack, time waited for no one.</p>

<h3>Qingguang Defeated Yeshi (Group A)</h3>
<p>50 to 20. In the match between Qingguang and Yeshi, Yeshi's momentum was very strong at the beginning.

Although the Qingguang players had been fighting on the field for a long time, they could not help but panic. About five minutes later, Lu Dachen scored a goal. After this, the situation became bleak again, and Yeshi's Chen and Zhao scored another five points. The audience thought that this battle would become like the Zhonggong vs. John's game the night before. Who knew that Qingguang's good performance was yet to come, and Tan's long-range shot hit the target. After that, they were smooth sailing, and the score increased steadily. In the first half, they won 24 to 13. In the second half, they became more lively, and both offense and defense were excellent, and every shot hit the target. They won against Yeshi 50 to 20. The referee was Blanc.</p>

<h3>Chizhi Defeated Huadong (Group A)</h3>
<p>34 to 28. The Chizhi players are good at hard work and are especially good at fighting to the end. Watching their previous games, it is not uncommon for them to turn defeat into victory in the second half. In this year's Western Youth Association Group A, the team can compete with the Western Youth Pirates for the championship, and their call for the title is no less than that of the Pirates. Huadong is composed of alumni from St. John's and Hujiang schools, and is a veteran in the basketball world, known for their soft skills. However, the original center, Li Chengyuan, had to play for Zhenru, and Flying General He Tong was still unable to play due to a foot injury, so their strength was not fully displayed. The game between the two teams last night was very popular due to their established reputations. The performances of both sides were excellent. After the start of the game, Chizhi's Qian Dingshen and Kong Guangyi scored successively, leading 4-0. Chizhi quickly caught up, and the situation for both sides was very tense. However, Huadong was still at a disadvantage. After 10-10, Huadong's Chuan Wuqiao scored two points with a free throw, taking the lead by one point. Chizhi then tied the score again. Suddenly, Huadong was again on the back foot. After mutual efforts, Lu Zhongen scored a goal, making it 18-16, leading Chizhi by two points in the first half. From the start of the second half, Huadong dared not relax, and the score was still in their favor. After becoming a 25-25 tie, Chizhi's Kong Guangsheng scored with a long shot, taking the lead by two points. Then, Huadong's Lu Zhongen also added two points, and Liang Guoquan scored a free throw, so Hua came and took the lead by one point again, with the score at 28-27. From then on, the competition became more intense, and the ball's momentum changed, making it difficult to predict the score. The audience was also very enthusiastic and loud. At this critical moment, in the final struggle, Chizhi's Wei Haiqing and Yang Lin Yu each scored a goal, which was fatal to Huadong. Although they tried to retaliate, the time had ended. Chizhi won 34-28. The referee was Wanfu.</p>

More than a thousand spectators gathered when the two strong teams met, and there were also quite a few Dongwu male students on the scene forming cheering squads.</p>
<h3>First Game</h3>
<p>At 4 o'clock, the referee Yu Jie blew the horn to start the game. Huang Liying of the Women's Middle School got the right to serve. The ball did not cross the net twice. Wang Huizhu of Dongwu flexed her arm, and the ball of the Suzhou Women's Team crossed the net without being prepared. Zhang set a record temporarily. Dongwu scored four points in a row. The sound was impressive, and the audience was worried about the Women's Middle School. It seemed that the Women's Middle School players this year were scattered veterans and seemed unable to compare with the heyday of the previous era. Later, thanks to the power of Zhang Yingfen of the Women's Middle School, she was able to regain the right to serve. Wang Rumin served the ball like an arrow, which seemed quite experienced. After repeated transfers, she made a quick upward surge, scoring five points in a row, reversing the situation to five to four. The ball was then served out of bounds, resulting in a dead ball. Chen Guifang of Dongwu also received three points. After a short while, Wang Liang of the Women's Middle School served the ball. Dongwu made a cut to win, Zhang Jie killed the ball out of bounds. After suffering multiple failures by Pu Pu, the Women's Middle School won the first half with eleven to seven. After changing sides, the Women's Middle School continued to wrestle. Zhang Yingfen blocked the gate, and Wang Rumin intercepted on the left and right. Although Dongwu had Zhang Jie's fierce attack and Guo Meifu's agility, they often failed to save the ball that was extremely easy to become dead due to the disorganized team. As a result, they lost to a score of eleven to twenty-one. The Suzhou Middle School won the first game.</p>
<h3>Second Game</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the second game, the Dongwu cheering squad cheered loudly. The score was still low after serving. Dongwu Gu Weiying made a bold bet and showed her great magical power. The score on the board showed a sudden increase for Dongwu again, and it had become a ratio of nineteen to eighteen, which was very close. It seemed that the difficult situation could be rescued at any moment, but unexpectedly, Zhang Lingyi failed twice in serving, one being out of bounds and one not crossing the net. Therefore, she had to watch Zhang Fen of the Women's Middle School complete the beautiful result. The audience lamented this. In this game, the Women's Middle School won with twenty-one to eighteen.</p>

<h3>Laugh It Off</h3>
<p>-- Sea Traveler</p>
<p>A: How would you think if the music from last night was good, but you weren't there to hear it?</p>
<p>B: I didn't hear any of it.</p>
<p>A: Are you deaf?</p>
<p>B: Because there were two ladies in front of me who kept talking and praising the music's beauty.</p>
<p>Housewife: Do you not have eyes? Don't you see the chairs are all dusty?</p>
<p>Servant: How can I not see? I'm embellishing things for the madam's sake.</p>
<p>Housewife: Nonsense! The chairs are covered in dust, making them impossible to sit on, and you say you're embellishing things for me?</p>
<p>Servant: Because the satin on those chairs is torn. I'm using the dust to cover it up so the guests don't see our poverty.</p>
<p>Father: My son, you should look at the example of the owner of that big store. He started as an apprentice and worked diligently for many years until he eventually owned the store himself.</p>
<p>Son: Father, times are different now. Big stores have new accounting machines that make it impossible for people to rise.</p>
<p>Wife: The Wangs next door probably bought this house.</p>
<p>Husband: They're renting, too. How do you know they bought it?</p>
<p>Wife: Because I heard Mrs. Wang scolding her little boy for dirtying the walls.</p>
<h3>Brief Account of Monk Dingneng</h3>
<p>-- Lian Weng</p>
<p>Monk Dingneng of Hangzhou's Li'an Temple, aged sixty-three, recently passed away due to dropsy that could not be cured. Fortunately, his kind wife provided the means for his funeral. An account of his life can supplement the amusing history of monks who disrupt, obstruct, and collide.</p>
<p>The monk's surname was Huang, his given name Luan, and he was from Jiangxi. His family set up a timber mill, and they were well acquainted with those who built for the Ministry of Works during the Qing Dynasty. His elder brother was recommended for his work on imperial tombs and appointed as a secretary. Huang also obtained a position as a prefect through the usual channels, awaiting assignment in Anhui. He was impeached by Zhongfeng for being willful and opportunistic, like a common monk. Forced to leave, he went to Beijing, where he met Minister Zhao Zhanru and then Assistant Grand Secretary Weng Shuping. Wu Zhixiu, the governor of Hangzhou, also favored him. Soon, Zhao was appointed as the Zhejiang financial commissioner. Huang's brother gave him a letter to present to Zhao. Huang wandered among the mountains and rivers. He learned that Li'an Temple was productive, so he cut his hair and became a monk, hoping to become the abbot. Mr. Yu Quyuan of Deqing saw his elegance and gifted him a poem on Huang's flute, which included the lines, "The Minister of Heaven is most pitiful; a yak-tail whisk is sent with tears to the spring. When the white-clad veteran returns, he will weep towards the empty mountain in his twilight years." It was about Zhao. Huang built a grand hall at Li'an Temple, exclusively funded by the wife of Zhang Dingfu of Nanxun. He also contacted local officials, and they all praised his abilities.</p>
<p>When the Qing court ordered the establishment of schools, Huang and Monk Songfeng of a certain temple conspired to seize the temple properties of various prefectures to run elementary schools. They went out with Songfeng to raise funds and named it “𫄏 Supervision Monk,” with Songfeng as the supervisor. Songfeng was killed by Monk Shao. Huang was afraid and united with a monk from a certain country to spread religion in Hangzhou's Longxing Temple. Local officials ordered someone to eliminate it. Huang then took his assets and fled to Japan but did not return. During the Zhejiang incident, he secretly instigated someone to seize the temple seat in Shanghai. Huang took his family to Hunan to run a mine for ten years. He then served as a section chief and later as a section member in the secretariat, eventually ending up in Shanghai, old and declining. He was known for his eloquence and was not an ordinary person.</p>
<p>It is said that the abbot of a certain temple had an old relationship with him and said, "People should look for a place to live, and especially a place to die. I'll find you a temple to die in." Huang was in a dilemma, unable to avoid either his wife or Zhou, and eventually became seriously ill. It's a pity that Mr. Quyuan's handwritten Huang Luan Song is still stored in a basket to be carried with him. Isn't Huang, who went from white to black and from black to white, an example of disruption, obstruction, and collision?</p>
<h3>A Record of the Chrysanthemum Banquet at Plum Garden</h3>
<p>-- Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>Plum Garden has flowers in all four seasons, and after the plums, chrysanthemums are the most abundant. This year, the chrysanthemums are especially plentiful. The host, Rong Degong, invited guests to a chrysanthemum appreciation banquet the day before yesterday. For a time, carriages and horses filled Houdao Road, and officials' hats mingled in sight. I and Mr. Zhang Baixi accompanied the host in the same carriage. Upon entering the garden, the autumn colors filled the garden, resembling brocade and heaped clouds. The flowers were densely arranged, and the winding paths were fragrant. Several maple forests were covered in frost, and the red leaves were even more enchanting, adding to the beauty. We entered the forest arm in arm and took a short rest while sipping tea. Looking into the distance, a pagoda stood tall in the clouds, the newly completed Nianqu Pagoda. Baixi asked me if I knew that the pagoda was completed but had not yet set foot in it, so he led me and two or three other guests to take a look first. Upon reaching the side of the pagoda, we ascended the steps and climbed the three-story pavilion. The high閣 was like a seven-level stupa. At the highest point, the entire view of Taihu Lake was in sight. On the pagoda, Qian Mingshan of Changzhou wrote an inscription and made a record, saying that Nianqu is a monument to the host's gratitude and remembrance of his parents. It allows visitors to appreciate the feeling of "an inch of grass repays the spring sun" during their visits, which is beneficial to society and the human heart. This is also the subtle meaning of showing concern for others. At noon, we returned to the Songyin Hall together and took our seats. There were many chrysanthemums displayed in the hall, and two screens of flowers were stacked against the walls, with mountains standing side by side in the east and west. The colors were beautiful and difficult to describe. The flowers were colorful and had various forms. We placed wine among the flowers, and the aroma filled the air. The autumn was intoxicating and even surpassed the beauty of spring. Yan Xiaoshan's words: "Surrounded by silk and satin, it is better than climbing high." Now we are sitting among the flowers and facing the lakes and mountains, which is like entering silk and satin and climbing high at the same time. The pleasure of the guests can be imagined. I am ashamed that I cannot name most of the chrysanthemums. I only remember that there was a chrysanthemum called Su'e. I returned and wrote a poem for it, using the Ci poem form Gaoyangtai:</p>
<p>Her makeup is light, like misty smoke, and her spirit is clear, like salty dew. The moon is bright, and the curtains are rolled up in the dusk. Her slender shadow stands in the cold, vaguely resembling a person leaning against the ice wheel. In her previous life, she must have lived in Huating. I ask her what year she was exiled to the mortal world. The west wind has blown over the eastern fence, but she has not yet understood the warmth. Her frost-like petals are not stained with rouge. Her color resembles a jade-like face. She is like a woman of the past, wearing white silk. She has a distinguished name and is born from a dream. The cool night is solitary, and I grieve for my late years. I recognize that the moonlit ground is filled with sorrow. A wisp of autumn soul from the blue sea and blue sky is the most dispelling.</p>
<h3>Elegant Sounds After Autumn</h3>
<p>-- Man Qing</p>
<p>Yu Shuanghua, the main singer Cheng Yanqiu, performed in Shanghai for a month and gained a great reputation. After she stopped singing the day before yesterday, people in Shanghai were worried that it would not be easy to find someone to replace her after the frost flowers had bloomed. Unexpectedly, Madam Zhu Naigen (original name Nai Geng), known by her stage name Yanan, a major figure in the ticket collecting world, was invited to the Tianchan Stage and is scheduled to lightly sweep her eyebrows and gracefully take the stage on the twentieth night. From the vast sky, another new moon is revealed, possessing a unique charm. Her radiance will complement Yu Shuang's, one before the other, like a sea traveler's tale, adding another layer of rhyme. The night before last, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Yefeng, Gu Zhuxuan, and others gave a banquet for Madam Yanan Zhu's debut at Hangzhou Restaurant. More than two hundred people attended, all famous figures in Shanghai, enjoying fresh food and fine wine to the extreme. Zheng Zhengqiu gave a speech during the banquet, saying that performing and listening to opera are both difficult. He said that performing is difficult because it is hard to find the right role, and listening is difficult because it is hard to be a connoisseur. In recent times, performers have all become conceited, and viewers and listeners only seek pleasure for their eyes and ears. Both are wrong. Now, Madam Yanan Zhu, as a respectable lady from a prominent family, is courageously entering the theater to promote the art of singing and dancing and to correct past mistakes. She has a solid foundation in the arts. Her pronunciation of the four tones, the yin and yang, the distinction between sharp and round, and the pronunciation of words are all precise. Her piano playing is also exquisite. I am very impressed by this. Therefore, now that I hear that Madam Yanan is taking the stage, I hope that viewers and listeners will be realistic and objective in their evaluations and guidance, so that our country's opera can flourish again. This is also fortunate for the future of art. Zhengqiu's speech was roughly like this, and it largely agreed with my ideas. I said that since Youmeng, the court jester, all the actors and musicians of Pear Garden have been recorded in history with praise and criticism. Who will show praise for past rights and wrongs and satire on the future, as well as good and evil in the present? Therefore, I express my appreciation to Yanan and Yanqiu. This is written as a record.</p>
<h3>Fart Song (Imitating Little Hothead Tune)</h3>
<p>— Drunkard</p>
<p>According to a news report from Tokyo (Japan) on the 17th, after Prime Minister Hamaguchi was shot, his changing condition has caused widespread suspicion and fear. Subsequently, he continued to fart twice, releasing a large amount of gas from his abdomen. Those nearby were overjoyed and celebrated. Secretaries Nakajima and Toda immediately notified the outside groups and party offices of the fart news. Party members all shouted "Long live!" Secretary Toda even composed a poem praising the Prime Minister's fart and celebrated with champagne, describing the scene as the first time since the Prime Minister's hospitalization that there was such a joyful celebration. How grand! Truly an unprecedented new record in the farting world. It is a pity that the fart poem could not be read. The "Crane in the Merry Grove" once published a humorous and satirical fart article, and after reading it, I couldn't help but feel inspired. So, I composed a few lines of a fart song and sent it to the "Free Talk" section, acting as a substitute for my countrymen to offer congratulations. It is neither cold mockery nor fervent praise. Readers can treat me as (Little Hothead).</p>
<p>Fart, fart, truly strange! One fart is released, then another follows. The sound is like music, the air like orchids. The gas is expelled, escaping danger and entering safety. Farting once and again, the contribution is significant. The telegram reports, "Haha, heehee!" A national cry of "Long live!" The whole country seems delirious. Champagne is opened, a poem is sung praising the fart. Shaking heads and wagging brains, respectfully holding up the fart. The flesh of a weak nation, the fart of a great man. The weak are prey to the strong, a large fart is full of flavor. Generous and magnanimous, the Prime Minister's belly has a fart. A line to the end must be released. Extraordinary, not a vulgar fart. Fragrant for thousands of years, the sound spreads for ten thousand miles. As if hearing the painted sound, as if listening. A good show can quench thirst, can relieve hunger. One person farts, ten thousand people rejoice. The "fart-ness" of a fart is so incredible. Such farting is truly strange. Fart luck prospers forever, never changing.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Travel Notes (80)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Longhua Temple is quite small, with only a dozen Chinese monks, and its area is within a Burmese temple. Master Daojie wants to build a new cluster of huts for Chinese monks and laypeople to come and go, worship the pagoda, and have a place to stay, but there is no private land to buy. It is said that most of the land on the market is government land, which can only be rented and is not convenient. Upon arriving at the temple, I took off my shoes, walked barefoot on the muddy water, and followed the master to worship the Great Golden Pagoda.</p>
<p>The Great Golden Pagoda is the most famous pagoda in East Asia. In the center, east, west, north, and south, there are four large pagodas, and each of the eight sides has small pagodas, totaling more than twenty pagodas, with a circumference of about one mile and a height of about one thousand two hundred feet. There are about a thousand Buddha statues of various sizes. There are four gates: east, west, south, and north. The south gate is the most prosperous, with various exquisite Buddha statues, oiled and un-oiled, that China does not have and should circulate. However, their prices are very expensive, at least one per statue (one Chinese yuan and three). There are also many women selling flowers, which are very fragrant, for tourists to offer to the Buddha. The east gate is for essential goods only. The north gate is for restaurants. The west gate has nothing. In addition, each small pagoda in the tiered pagoda contains marble statues, with offering tables and mats for people to worship. There is also a Dharma master giving lectures, ascending the seat to preach from time to time, and men and women listen respectfully. During the day, seats are available for worship, and in the evening, one can also stay overnight. Many men and women, monks and laypeople, live here. However, there are women with children who live here permanently, because this place has no four seasons, and a mat and a blanket are enough to make a home.</p>
<p>Another thing that is very different from China is that the beautiful Buddha statues here are all marble statues, which are very rare in China. Also, there are only statues of Shakyamuni Buddha and no other statues. Therefore, I asked why they only believe in Theravada Buddhism and think that Mahayana Buddhism is not taught by the Buddha, so they only worship Shakyamuni alone. Although there is only Shakyamuni, the statues they offer are all different, some kind, some sorrowful, some joyful, some like beautiful women, all like twenty-year-old beauties or young boys. There are no Buddhas like those in China, and all the statues have their eyes open, none sitting with their eyes closed. Some are decorated with gold, some are not. Seeing these statues gives one the feeling of imagining Prince Siddhartha Gautama as a refined and handsome young man who sat quietly, deeply contemplating and realizing the Great Way, thereby personally eliminating his empire and capitalism and aligning himself with the common people. Perhaps the statues can express simple and direct principles, unlike the convoluted nature of Chinese Buddhism. Westerners who come here become monks, and women also wear swastika gold ornaments, greatly appreciating the art of Eastern Buddha statues.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Record of the Ordeal of Cheng Shih-kuei, Commissioner of Education of Fujian Province</h3>
<p>— Yang</p>
<p>Cheng Shih-kuei, member of the Fujian Provincial Government and Commissioner of Education, due to his strong advocacy of earmarking the salt surtax for education, incurred the displeasure of Wu Xuan. During the "January 6th Incident" in Fujian Province this year, he and six other provincial commissioners, including Lin Chih-yuan, were detained by Lu Hsing-jung and subsequently held in Youxi for ten months. On October 28th, with the exception of Chen Nai-yuan, who died of illness, all others were fortunate to survive. On the same day, local people rushed to the Hongshan Bridge pier to welcome them, followed by public banquets for several days. On November 2nd, at 9 a.m., a grand welcoming meeting was held at the South School Field, with participants numbering over ten thousand, holding banners with the words "Welcome Commissioner Cheng." The assembly presented a silver shield inscribed with the four characters "Rooted in Righteousness" to commemorate the occasion. In the afternoon of the same day, a variety show was held at the Nanhua Theater, with Commissioner Cheng in attendance, lasting until midnight. The above supplements what was lacking and not recorded in various newspapers. Now, I will select what is unknown to outsiders from Commissioner Cheng's diary of his ordeal and recount the general outline. Readers may not regard it as the ramblings of a madman.</p>
<p>On the evening of January 6th, Cheng went to a banquet at the home of his friend Yun Shan. He took his seat at 8 p.m., along with other commissioners from the party headquarters and provincial government. After about twenty minutes of drinking, they suddenly heard a commotion outside. Just as they were wondering what was happening, more than ten armed soldiers rushed in and immediately tied up Lin Chih-yuan, Hsu Cheng-mou, and Cheng Tsai-wo. Cheng was also tied up, but then released. After a short wait, Lu Hsing-jung directed the soldiers to tie Cheng's hands again and told everyone not to panic, saying only that they were invited to sit for a while. With that, he escorted Cheng and the other four out of the door and into a neighboring house. The soldiers bound them tightly with hemp rope, tying Lin and Hsu's necks and backs together, a so-called "five-flower binding." Soon after, soldiers searched the four men, ostensibly looking for handguns, but actually robbing them. Around 10 p.m., more than ten soldiers came and stuffed white cloth into Cheng and the others' mouths, then forced them onto a car and sped away, their destination unknown. They assumed they were being taken to the school field for execution by firing squad. Upon reaching their destination, they got out of the car into the dark night, which seemed to be near Hongshan Bridge. They were driven onto a steamship. The soldiers conducted a second search. Soon after, they were taken to a dilapidated house in an arsenal and ordered to remove the cloth from their mouths, but their hands remained bound as before. The two men were tied together, like cattle. Shortly thereafter, Wu Yi-fu and Chen Ai-wu were also arrested and brought there. By then, the night was deep. All six wanted to relieve themselves, but with their hands bound, they could not untie their clothes. They pleaded with the guards, who repeatedly scolded them. Finally, in desperation, they pleaded again, and the guards untied them. After they finished, the guards did not retie them, so they had to stand back-to-back and forcibly tighten the ropes themselves with their bound hands. Fortunately, a young soldier showed some compassion and occasionally brought them tea and food.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he felt carefree, but wondered why he had ended up in this situation. He wanted to ask each other what had happened, but because the guards were watching closely, they remained silent. Around 2 a.m., more soldiers were added to the guard, and they were ordered to go outside, thinking that they were about to be killed. After a few steps, they were ordered to board a boat, crammed into a cabin like transporting pigs. The soldiers made a third search. Being bound caused his wrists to ache, so he begged the officer to temporarily loosen the ropes, since they were already on the boat and the boat had already set sail, and there were guards, so there was no chance of escape. At first, he refused, but after persistent pleading, he went to report, saying that the official was asleep and he dared not disturb him. The night was deep and the cold was severe. Sitting and lying down were both painful. Every time he turned over, the pain went to his heart, and he groaned all night, unable to sleep.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 7th, there was no water for washing. He asked the guard if the prisoners' meals were prepared, as they had been considered prisoners from the beginning. The guard untied his hands to eat, but retied them afterward as before. After two or three hours, only the two hands were tied. The walls of the boat were made of iron. The six men sat facing each other in two cabins, like an iron window. Cheng recalled that last spring, when he inspected northern Fujian, he had passed through this place by boat and the boat had broken a large hole in the stone reef. At that time, there was a poem about the danger of the boat being like an egg on an island, and life being as insignificant as a feather. Now, his situation was even more dangerous.</p>
<p>The next day, they arrived at Shuikou and then Youxi. As the boat traveled further north, the cold increased. At night, there was not a single blanket to cover them. The boat owner gave them a cloth bag to cover their feet, which was slightly better than nothing. Without a pillow, they borrowed a bundle of firewood to use as one. Cheng, Zheng Tsai-wo, and Chen Ai-wu slept together in one bed, hugging each other to keep warm. Every time he fell asleep, he was awakened by the cold, and the long night was dim, his body like a falling stone.</p>
<p>Afterward, the guards ordered them to disembark and climb the stone steps. Ai-wu, due to illness, had been bound and confined until he could hardly support himself. Cheng helped him up, but he could only sit on a stone foundation, unable to move. After a long time, he said, "Please shoot me quickly! I cannot endure this suffering!" Alas, one can imagine the scene at that time. After that, Huang, an official, arrived. Cheng, Hsu, and Wu were sent to Nanping, while the others were sent to Youxi. Thereupon, Cheng often composed poems to express his feelings and send them to his friends, totaling fifty or sixty poems. I will now record a few poems to conclude this account. Sending to Three Friends: The wine comes, let us drink three cups. After talking, let us sleep for a while. What else is there to worry about? It is best in the mountains not to know the years. I heard that Zhi-yuan's foot disease is cured, and Ai-wu's lung disease is nearing recovery. After our separation in righteousness, I hope you are well. Every day I care about your daily life. Living in the Mountains, Feeling: Clouds emerge from the mountains behind the house. White clouds fly over the mountain every day. The myriad phenomena are desolate for a moment. It may not be for rain. It is a waste of a lifetime coming out of the caves. Living in the mountains, feeling: The mountains naturally have pine and cypress, only nourishing the heart. The world is already like this, who can seek fate? Mountain flowers charm the empty valleys, wild springs play with clear strings. After resting, the evening breeze passes by, leisurely recalling ancient times.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Show Renewed Progress</h3>
<p>Market conditions changed unexpectedly yesterday, the 22nd, with the gold market showing a sharp upward trend, but with intermittent fluctuations, causing some confusion in the market. Industry sentiment was uncertain. The foreign exchange market seemed to tighten, with posted rates decreasing by half a notch. Banks were still selling English gold, and transactions within the industry were frequent, but the methods varied. For example, Fuchang, Yuanheng initially sold and then purchased. Tychang, Taikang, and Runfu, in addition to others, all bought. Xiyou, Yuanmao, Yongji, and others all sold. The overseas silver market continued to decline, especially with strong selling pressure from the United States. As a result, the gold price opened high. Afterwards, the cashiers of various firms diverged, and market sentiment became agitated, fluctuating constantly. From morning to noon, it fluctuated within a few liang's range. Exchange rates changed slightly. The final trend was upward, reaching 89 liang, driven by large purchases from Yuanheng and other major players. It was reported that the market would close early due to the usual Saturday closing.</p>
<p>The market opened erratically at 8:55 a.m. The January opening price was 588 liang 1 qian, an increase of 2 liang (the raw market was stable, with short positions being sold at around 8 liang). The large bars declined by 1/16, and the silver price declined by 1/8. Afterwards, Yifeng and Yongfeng made considerable purchases, driving the price from 87 liang 5 qian to 89 liang. Exchange rates also showed an upward trend. Erjing bought 1.275 qian of nearby Japanese silver. Datong sold January English gold at 171.875, but Xiyou, Yuanheng, Yuancheng, and retail investors all sold, causing the price to soften again to 87 liang 1 qian. The initial announcement was reduced by 1.25, the US dollar was reduced by 2 jiao 5, and Japanese gold was increased by 0.75, but this had little effect, only raising the price by 2 qian. Yuanheng and others continued to sell, followed by Yuanmao and Yuanfang selling, bringing the price down to 85 liang 9 qian at 9:50 a.m. March English gold was traded among banks at 172.50, and the market seemed to strengthen. Fuyu and Jinan bought, bringing the price to 87 liang 2-3 qian at 10:30 a.m., then it fell again by 4 qian to 6 liang 9 qian. At 10:45 a.m., the industry was closing out positions. Macgregor sold January English gold at 172.5 to 187.5, and Fuyu, Yuanxing, Yongyong, Fuchang, Tychang, and others rushed to buy, causing the price to jump to 1 liang at 11 o'clock. However, short positions were sold, and Yuanmao, Zhifeng, YongAnli, and others followed suit, along with miscellaneous firms. Hengxing also sold slightly, and the price fell again by 1.5-6 qian in just 20 minutes, reaching 6 liang 5 qian at 11:30 a.m.</p>
<p>In the end, the market was strong and suddenly moved upward. Yuanheng sold and Fuxingyong also bought. Renyou absorbed January English gold at 172.5, and Huabi sold at 187.5. Market sentiment recovered and suddenly jumped up 2.5 liang, reaching 89 liang at noon. The closing price was 8 liang 9 qian, an increase of 2 liang 8 qian compared to the previous day. The highest price during the half day was 9 liang, and the lowest price was 5 liang 9 qian, a difference of 3 liang 1 qian. The posted price was changed to 622 liang 2 qian due to the high Japanese gold price, a decrease of 25-6 liang. The noon settlement was 33 liang. The account books showed 96 liang for the current month, 92 liang for the next month, 89 liang for January, a water supplement of 96 liang, and the miscellaneous market opened at 7 liang 8 qian and closed at 8 liang 6 qian.</p>
<p>Transactions among firms were mixed. Fuchang and Yuanheng sold and then bought. Yifeng, Yongjiu, Dafuxing, Yongtaikang, Runfu, Tongtaichang, Shunli, Fuyu, and Jinan all bought. Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Yuancheng, Yongyuanxing, and Yong also experienced mixed buying and selling. Zhifengyong and Xiyou sold. Zidayuancheng, Hengxing, Hongli, Chunyuan, and Yong also sold. Yongfeng initially bought and then sold. Miscellaneous firms initially sold and then bought. Overall, sales were greater than purchases. Some firms did not have large transactions, and the volume of sales was limited. The Dalian group's demand exceeded supply, with over 900 bars being purchased and over 600 being sold. The Cantonese group sold a small number.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Tightens Both Openly and Covertly</h3>

Mitsui and Sumitomo absorbed tens of thousands of pounds. American gold was traded among banks at 100,000 yuan.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Remain Sluggish</h3>

<h3>Cotton Market Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>The cotton market is mediocre. Both American and Indian cotton are trending downwards. Raw cotton mills are not purchasing. It is reported that after Chinese and foreign mills have purchased fixed amounts of Indian cotton, the consumption of Chinese cotton is completely replaced by foreign cotton. However, due to the obstruction of the source by bandits, the arrival of goods is still scarce, and market sentiment remains firm. Bull positions are holding the recent month's market higher.</p>
<p>Han Standard No Turnaround. Before the market opened, the atmosphere in the Han Standard market was still calm. Although American cotton was in decline, it only fell by 5 points. The Han gang covered their short positions and returned to firmness. As a result, each fell by 5 points.

<h3>Consistent Drop in Foreign Yarn and Cotton Prices</h3>

<h3>American Cotton Prices Wavered Last Week</h3>
<p>New York, 21st (via telegraph report): Regarding raw cotton for the week, the cotton market wavered last week. Many bulls liquidated December contracts and moved to forward contracts in large numbers. Merchants bought December contracts and hedged forward contracts when the price difference between near and far months could offset their freight costs. Counterparts mostly bought forward contracts, mainly to replenish their sold spot goods. The stranding of major small banks limited the redemptive buying of speculators. The buying of forward wheat by the Grain Stabilization Corporation seemed sufficient to disturb the hearts of the cotton market, but officials from the Agricultural Policy Bureau stated that raw cotton itself could take considerable protection. Looking at the general market trend, it seems to be wavering between the statistical advantage of short sellers and the low prices sufficient to limit production and stimulate consumption.</p>

<h3>Continued Decline in Grain and Rice Market Prices Down the River</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the number of rice boats from inland decreased slightly, totaling just over 30. Sales remained sluggish. Ordinary "Geng" rice remains high-priced, and secondary quality is weak. Prices for various types of "Geng" rice must continue to fall by 3-4 jiao. The closing market showed a slight stabilization, with special grade rice still opening around the 15 yuan mark. Prices are steadily declining. Transactions are sluggish and few. Special grade items have already fallen to around 13 yuan. Sales of "Yang" rice are quiet, and appetites are very weak. High-priced at 12 yuan and 3 jiao. "Du Jian" rice at 12 yuan, 4 jiao and 5 fen. Prices for each have dropped by about 2 jiao. Because of sluggish sales and limited arrivals, "Bu Xian" rice appears to be stagnant. "Ke Jian" rice is barely opening at 11 yuan, 4 jiao, with very few sources. In recent days, it is difficult to predict whether the shape of the "Xian" rice market will turn implicit. "Lv Lian" has been sluggish for nearly a week. Store sales are feared to be selling out for cash. The city trend is sluggish and stable. The general market remains at 14 yuan and 7 jiao, while "Yin Yuan" is not selling well and has fallen back to around 12 yuan.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, the number of boats arriving from down the river was still just over 20. Unloading was sluggish. "Chang Bang Ding Geng" rice frequently went downstream. High-quality and soft types have both been reduced by three jiao, but super-high-quality goods are still hovering around 14 and a half yuan. "Su Tong Geng" rice, on the other hand, felt stable. Because the retail market is cheap, transactions are slightly carried out, and the market stands still. Thin rice such as "Nan Bang Qing Ding," etc., is difficult to maintain and has fallen again. Higher quality rice, such as "Bai Dao" and "Zao Dao" rice, only opened between 12 yuan and 6 or 7 jiao, while "Zhong Guan Wan Bang" has already fallen into the 12 yuan range. The market situation is quite sluggish. Sources for "Yang Du" rice are goods with medium quality, which have mostly sold. The disk surface only has a price movement above and below a corner. The situation of "Yin Yuan" is that activity to the end is rare, and prices are stable.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Sales of "Ke Xian" Rice Market</h3>
<p>The Japanese rice market has already seen samples of "Ke Xian" rice. Yesterday, the market for "Ke Xian" rice remained flat and soft. Because "Ke Bang" rice still lacks appetite, and there are no large tickets being sold from this street, the market has no good prospects for the time being. However, because there is not much in stock and few new arrivals, market prices can still maintain the temporary situation. The total market was handled by this street. More than 300 bags of Jiangxi machine-made rice were sold at 10 yuan and 2 jiao. 120 bags of Nanjing machine-made rice were priced at 10 yuan. Also, 100 bags of Nanjing machine-made rice were priced at 10 yuan, 0 jiao, and 1 jiao and a half.</p>
<p>Recently, both "Yang Mi" rice arrivals have been in short supply. It will be difficult to conclude deals this year because the set prices are not cost-effective. However, Japanese rice that has arrived on the market has already shown sample rice products similar to "Du Geng" rice. However, because the rice stored in the warehouse is slightly yellow, it is said.</p>
<h3>Mixed Conditions in the Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw gradual increases in both the afternoon and afternoon openings. Because the price of "Yang Mai" wheat rose, it seemed that short sellers had already been profitable, so many rushed to make up for the shortfall. Before and after noon, the factory also threw out small orders. After the close, there was also a revolving machine for short sellers. As a result, there was no access in this month. December is still a small half. January is big 7 li and a half. February is big half. March and April are big 7 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Depressed by Foreign Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market saw a slight improvement in morale after the market opened due to the price increase of "Yang Mai" foreign wheat. "Yang Mai" foreign wheat rose by another 3, 4, to 5 or 6 jiao. Combined with the gradual rise in the past three days, it has also risen sharply by nearly 1 yuan to 2 yuan. The market seems to be able to stand still temporarily. However, there are too many fixed-order foreign wheat, and the flour sales are stagnant. So the group sold futures to the exchange. The market was suppressed by the fixed-order wheat. Although the price of "Yang Mai" foreign wheat rose, the market price was sold off, resulting in a small close. This month is small 5 fen. December is small 6 fen. Far-term is small 1 fen to 3 fen. Various factories have no interest in "Xian Mai" current wheat. The total market has not had a single bag transaction.</p>
<h3>Sharp Fall in Standard Bean Cake Market</h3>
<p>Early in the morning, the term bean was still flat. Because the port of Niuzhuang was sealed by the river, and the market in Yingkou fell. Goods from all producing areas in the East Province were shipped to Dalian for sale. As a result, foreign businessmen waited and did not move forward. The city of Dalian suddenly turned soft.

<h3>Foreign Monopoly on South China Shipping</h3>
<p>Chinese ships will resume scheduled service. Foreign ships travel 330 times a year between Shanghai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong. Cargo transport and passenger tickets suffer losses of seven to eight million yuan annually. Chinese ships will begin resuming service to the ports of South China, Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong from December 1. This is the most important shipping line along the Chinese coast. Chinese merchant ships have been suspended from service due to the current situation for almost two years. Foreign merchants took advantage of the opportunity and made inroads. In the past two years, the rights to shipping along the South China coast have been almost entirely monopolized by them. Today, they have reversed roles and Chinese merchant ships have almost no place to stand. Now that the military situation is over and merchant ships have been returned to Shanghai, the various Chinese merchant ships are already discussing restoring the South China route from December 1 in order to save the lost shipping rights. The interruption has been well-documented.</p>
<p>Foreign shipping forces have grown daily. British merchants see the Shanghai route to Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong as the main port among China's near-sea routes. Therefore, Taikoo and Jardine Matheson are doing their utmost to operate it. In the past two years, while China's military situation was intense and merchant ships were suspended, they were intent on expanding ship schedules and frequency. Taikoo added new 4,000-ton ships such as the Jinan and Taiyuan to the route, and together with the Jardine Matheson ships, monopolized all the business of the Chinese ships. The number of ships coming and going each year has increased to more than 260 trips. Japanese merchants were unwilling to let British ships enjoy a monopoly and also added ships to the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Shantou-Xiamen line, scheduling 70 trips a year. As for Chinese ships, they have operated less than one-tenth as much as foreign ships in the past two years.</p>
<p>Shipping losses in the past two years: South China business has been the best in the past two years. British and Japanese ships have compensated for the losses they suffered on the Yangtze and North China routes with the profits from this route. A local Chinese merchant ship bureau recently investigated the total freight and passenger revenue of British and Japanese ships on the Shantou-Xiamen-Guangdong line, including both ship tickets and cargo transport. Last year, British ships made a net profit of 5.7 million yuan, and Japanese ships made a profit of more than one million yuan. This year has been even better than last year because there are no Chinese ships and foreign merchants have increased freight rates several times. Recently, British and Japanese ships have been earning close to 30,000 taels for each trip to South China. Freight rates were raised again by 10% on the 18th of this month.</p>
<p>British ships to Southeast Asia are booming. Hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese travel to the islands of Southeast Asia every year. Because there are no Chinese ships, they all travel on foreign ships. In order to win over the overseas Chinese who travel back and forth between their ancestral land and Southeast Asia, the Taikoo company has specially opened four new routes in Shantou, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Haikou, Xiamen, Shantou, Singapore, Hong Kong, Haiphong, Hanoi, and Beihai, dispatching fourteen 4,000- and 5,000-ton ships. Jardine Matheson and Java Company regretted the Xiao Xin'an incident and Xiamen refused to take Dutch ships, so the British company took this opportunity and dispatched six China-India ships to replace Dutch ships on the Xiamen-Southeast Asia route. The headliner of the first flight of the "Great Marley" ship will depart tomorrow.</p>
<p>Chinese ships are discussing resuming operations. The only Chinese ship company on the South China route is China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Since the suspension of service, not a single Chinese ship has been operating. Now, General Manager Li Zhonggong has repeatedly received telegrams from the Fujian and Guangdong branch offices, stating that the South China cargo and passenger traffic is congested and the company's ships are frequently out of service, sitting idly by as foreign merchants seize huge profits. Now, sugar cane, bananas, palm fans, etc. are on the market, and they are asking for a quick resumption of service. Furthermore, Fujian Bureau Chief Li Guiyuan telegraphed that since the Xiao Xin'an incident, overseas Chinese in Fujian and Guangdong provinces have all hoped that the bureau will add routes to the islands of Southeast Asia. The overseas Chinese are willing to fully assist and will always take the bureau's ships. General Manager Li discussed it with the operations department yesterday and decided that because of the lack of ships, he had to make do with what he had and officially resume the South China route on December 1. Among the bureau's four ships, only the "Xinchang" can travel to Hong Kong. It has now been decided that the "Guangli" and "Guangtai" will specialize in the Shanghai-Shantou-Xiamen-Guangdong route and that the heads of the two ships will be rebuilt to suit passengers and fruit transportation. Furthermore, the "Xinchang" will be rushed to repair and will open on the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Guangdong route. After the "Xinfeng" is repaired, it will replace the "Taishun" to open the Shanghai-Shantou-Guangdong route. Each ship will be scheduled to resume service from the 1st of next month. Yesterday, telegraphs were sent to the Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong branch offices to comply. A plan is already underway to develop the routes to the islands of Southeast Asia and will be discussed after a decision is made to purchase ships. The Fujian Bureau has been telegraphed to first contact the overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Taikoo Seamen's Wage Increase Case</h3>
<p>The two parties signed a contract yesterday. Jardine Matheson and Nissin are still in negotiations. The case of seamen demanding a wage increase from foreign ships has been repeatedly negotiated by the Seamen's Industrial Federation and the British Taikoo Company, and with the mediation of Yu Qiaqing, an increased salary contract has been signed. Yesterday (22nd), representatives from the Seamen's Union went to the Taikoo Company to sign a supplementary contract. The demand that has been made for several months has finally been resolved. Yesterday, the union reported the signing and reconciliation to the Seamen's General Association, saying: "Regarding the report, on the morning of the 22nd of this month, at 10:00 AM, we received a letter from the Taikoo Steamship Company, inviting us to sign the wage increase contract for Shanghai firemen, sailors, and stewards at 12:00 noon on the same day. The time was pressing, so this seat invited the concurrent Shanghai branch to appoint Yong Sheng, together with Secretary Liu Yuzhou and Li Zuyou, to go to the company on time to review the contract. The amended original draft was no different from this meeting, so we signed two copies, each holding one. The contract is reported to the General Assembly for reference and storage, and notified to the branch office and the various steamship companies. The right to report the 90th regular meeting of the General Assembly Organizing Committee is attached to the contract. Director of the Committee: Zhao Zhizhi. Republic of China, November 22, 1930." The contract provisions are as follows: The Chinese Seamen's Industrial Federation and the Shanghai Taikoo Steamship Company have signed a Seamen's Wage Increase Contract: (1) Starting from September 1, 1930, the Shanghai Taikoo Steamship Company will increase the monthly salary of each fireman, sailor, and steward of the three departments of the various steamships under its jurisdiction by 4 yuan, and the current monthly rice subsidy of 2 yuan will be cancelled on the same day. (2) The Seamen's Union must assist the business of the Taikoo Steamship Company to the extent possible. (3) After the two contracts are signed, each party will hold one copy, and one copy will be kept in the Seamen's Union and one in the Taikoo Company. November 1, Republic of China, the following signing representatives: The union is Zhao Zhizhi, and Taikoo is Xing Ming Xingzhi. As for foreign ships such as Jardine Matheson and Nissin, because the capitalists have a tough attitude and few sincere negotiations, the seamen have already decided that Jardine Matheson and Nissin cannot follow the Taikoo example and must add a full monthly salary of 6 yuan, so the wage increase of the two companies is still under negotiation. The New Taikoo stevedore club has a total of 72 ships on the river and at sea, and there are more than 3,000 stevedores. This time, when the seamen's wage increase case started, the department also appointed club director Wang Zhengfu to join the Seamen's Union in requesting a monthly increase of 6 yuan from the buyers of each ship. At present, most of the ships have agreed to increase 4 yuan, and those that have not yet expressed their views are also in contact. According to the union's report, this case will soon be resolved.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Federation Petitions for Repeal of Passport Law - News</h3>
<p>Most central committee members expressed sympathy for the Overseas Chinese Federation. Due to the numerous drawbacks of the Provisional Passport Law formulated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the federation elected representatives Feng Hanyue and Qi Gongheng to go to the capital to petition for the repeal of the law during the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. The petition listed ten reasons. It is reported that Feng and Qi stated in their letters that most central committee members expressed great sympathy for the Overseas Chinese Federation's petition to repeal the passport law. When Secretary-General Chen Lifu met with the representatives, he also stated that it was unreasonable to charge overseas Chinese for passports when they returned to China. The government should only encourage overseas Chinese to return and would never want them to die and be buried in a foreign land, unable to return. It would be wrong to charge overseas Chinese six yuan for a passport and two yuan for a stamp fee. The foreign affairs authorities used this method to address the lack of funds for overseas consulates, which is unacceptable. He promised to do his best to suggest reducing the burden on overseas Chinese. He also stated that overseas consuls were completely useless. If they were useful, how could they sit idly by while overseas Chinese were arbitrarily imprisoned and deported by foreigners? Consuls should be severely punished.</p>

<h3>Citizens Training Association Orders Unions to Postpone Re-elections</h3>

<h3>Sock Workers Request Revision of Labor-Management Conditions</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting with both parties yesterday, but it was postponed because the representative of the management was absent. The conditions set by the sock workers in this city in 1927 are very inappropriate and need to be revised. The executive committee of the labor union has passed 22 articles and submitted them to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation after being reviewed and approved by the Citizens Training Association. The most important of these is the second article, which stipulates that the trade association should subsidize the workers' children's school run by the labor union with 120 yuan per month. The seventh article stipulates that the management should restrict the recruitment of new workers (based on the number of sock machines in each factory, each sock machine may recruit one new worker or apprentice per year). The twentieth article stipulates that a wage assessment committee should be jointly formed by both parties to classify and determine wages within a short period of time. The Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting with both parties yesterday, but the trade association of the management, the Knitting Industry Association, did not send representatives to attend, making it impossible to conduct mediation. It is now heard that the Social Affairs Bureau has decided to convene another meeting last week.</p>

Because the steamer was eager to proceed and the river water was low tide, the brick boat was hit by the steamer, causing it to break and sink into the river. The boatmen who fell into the water were fortunately rescued by nearby civilian boats. However, after the brick boat sank, the waterway was blocked, and dozens of ships were unable to pass. The cargo owner has tried to move the ship to the side of the bank, and the waterway is barely passable, but all the small steamers were delayed. The boatmen who lost their boat have claimed compensation from Gong Mao, and negotiations are still underway. The sunken bricks are also being salvaged and it will take about four days to dredge the river and restore it to its original state.</p>
<p>Lake Steamer Robbed, Follow-up Report - The Yuanfa Steamer of Yuan Tong Company (Dai Shengchang) on the Shanghai-Lake route was robbed and injured a passenger, as reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the steamer has returned to Shanghai from the lake and resumed normal service. The robbery took place 15 miles away from Huzhou, at a place called Deep Mountain. The bandits were waiting on the way, intending to rob the Wuzhen Steamer, but the Huzhou Steamer arrived first. Five bandits, each carrying a rifle and pistol, fired a shot and ordered the steamer to stop. The crew did not dare to resist because they had no weapons on board, so they had to stop the steamer at the shore. Because the engine stopped a little late, the bandits fired a volley of shots at the steamer. A young passenger, only about 20 years old, who was returning to the lake from Shanghai, was shot and killed instantly inside the boat. After the bandits boarded the ship, they first searched and robbed the steamer, and then robbed the passengers of their silver, jewelry, clothes, etc. Fearing the bandits, they let them take everything. The heavy cargo was completely untouched. There was a platoon of the local town's security corps nearby. The robbery took place at 3:00 pm. When the corps members heard the continuous gunshots, they suspected that a large number of bandits were planning to rob the town, so they all carried weapons out of the town, but they did not dare to go forward, fearing that the bandits were too numerous to resist. Therefore, they first fired a volley of shots into the sky to help boost their morale. The bandits heard the gunshots on the shore, suspecting that the government troops had come to arrest them, and quickly divided the looted cash and clothes into several packages and fled ashore. When the security corps arrived, the bandits had already fled far away. The Yuanfa Steamer then raised its anchor and went to Huzhou to report to the local public security bureau. The deceased was photographed and confirmed to have died from a gunshot wound, and the coffin was prepared in advance. It is reported that the loss of the ship and passengers amounted to several thousand dollars. The case has been reported and is being investigated. There are currently six companies operating small steamers from Shanghai to Huzhou. Since this incident occurred, they have all requested the Zhejiang Water Police to send patrol boats to protect the travel, as the end of the year is approaching and there are more passengers and cargo traveling back and forth.</p>
<h3>The Xin Dingxiang Case Expands</h3>
<p>The Support Association Submits to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Re-Engage with the Foreign Authorities - The Municipal Government Sends a Letter to the French Consul to Punish the Murderer - Various Unions in Zhabei Issue a Declaration to the Whole Country - The Support Association to Host Journalists Tonight - The case of Xin Dingxiang, a sampanman who was pushed into the Huangpu River by a French sailor and drowned, has aroused great indignation among various groups in Shanghai. They have jointly launched the Xin Case Support Association and submitted a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to engage seriously with the French authorities to achieve the goals of punishing the murderer, apologizing, and paying compensation. In recent days, newspapers have repeatedly reported and discussed the case, but the French authorities have remained indifferent, showing the stubbornness of the French. The Shanghai Municipal Government also believes that this case involves issues of national identity and international law, so it has sent a special letter to the French Consul to engage with the case. The Xin Case Support Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, and more than 50 unions in Zhabei also issued a declaration on the Xin case. The association also plans to host journalists at Fuxing Garden on Fuzhou Road tonight. The documents are as follows:</p>
<p>The Support Association Submits to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Regarding the fact that sailors from the French fleet's warship "Huatake Miaosha" relied on their strength to behave barbarously and beat the sampanman Xin Dingxiang, causing him to fall into the Huangpu River and die a tragic death, please engage in a reasonable manner to maintain national rights and protect the nation. It has been verified that the sampanman Xin Dingxiang, whose registered residence is in Yin County, Shanghai, worked with his father, Hesheng, to row a sampan. On the evening of October 16, at 6:05 pm, he parked his sampan, No. 130, at the Waitouma Road Wharf in Haitianli, Yangshupu, Shanghai, waiting for customers. The French fleet's warship "Huatake Miaosha" (transliteration) was moored in the Huangpu River between the 12th and 13th buoys of the Hai Central Company. Two sailors from the warship were at the Waitouma Road Wharf, and Xin Dingxiang's sampan was chartered to the French merchant ship "Xiang Nasha" (transliteration) moored between another buoy in the center of the Huangpu River. The sailors visited friends and did not pay the boat fare, so they went on board. They asked Dingxiang to wait by the ship. At about 7:00 pm, the two sailors and three sailors from the merchant ship went down the ladder. The three sailors were in front, and the two sailors followed. The three sailors crossed Dingxiang's sampan to the Ge Amao sampan chartered by the French Company. One of the sailors immediately followed, and another sailor also wanted to cross. At that time, Dingxiang was standing at the bow of his boat, urgently asking him for the boat fare. He did not know that he had angered the sailor, who punched him hard, knocking Dingxiang into the river. At the same time, Zhu Gengsheng, a sampanman moored next to the Baina Sha Wheel, saw this situation and quickly untied the rope to rescue him, but after waiting for half an hour, he did not see Dingxiang floating up. The three sailors and one sailor in the Ge Amao boat saw that their companions had caused trouble and were afraid of being implicated if they went ashore, so they asked Ge Amao to row back to the Nasha. The sailor who punched Dingxiang into the river was taken to the Nasha by another sampan. After a while, the two sailors wanted to escape and took another sampan. When the sampan reached the Waitouma Road Wharf, they wanted to escape. When one of the sailors saw the boatmen standing around on the pier, he was afraid of being unfavorable. The boat did not dock, so he jumped up and was seized and held by the boatmen. At this time, Indian constable No. 415 arrived and handed him over to the police station, but he was released privately. Another sailor saw his companion being caught and stood still in the boat. He was also sent to the water patrol police by the boatmen and his father, Xin Hesheng. However, after the water patrol police station questioned the witnesses, Ge Amao, etc., they still privately released the sailor, causing the murderer to escape justice. This is the detailed process of the case. Subsequently, the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association convened a discussion on the case with lawyers. After examining the sailor's criminal behavior, it was concluded that the sailor had committed the crime of intentional homicide. Considering that these French imperialists use unequal treaties as a protective talisman and exercise a gunboat policy, infringing on our sovereignty, insulting our national character, and slaughtering our people, tragic incidents have occurred repeatedly. The occurrence of this Xin case has aroused indignation. After our association has been running around calling for action, the French authorities have not shown any sincerity in resolving the matter. Therefore, our association has passed eight requirements for treating the root cause and the symptoms at its fourth standing meeting. Requirements for treating the root cause: (1) Withdraw the armies of various countries stationed in China to ensure the integrity of the territory. (2) Abolish consular jurisdiction to ensure the integrity of legal rights. (3) Recover the concessions so that criminals have no place to escape. (4) Abolish unequal treaties so that foreigners cannot rely on them as a protective talisman. Requirements for treating the symptoms: (1) The French authorities should formally apologize to our government and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future. (2) Punish the murderer. (3) Compensate Xin Dingxiang's family with 100,000 taels of silver. (4) Provide Xin Dingxiang with 30,000 taels of silver for funeral expenses. We earnestly request that your minister, in the spirit of revolutionary diplomacy, resolutely take action in a reasonable manner to maintain national rights and protect the nation. Our association vows to be the support and will not hesitate to do so. We present this report with the utmost urgency and await your orders. Respectfully submitted to Wang, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, by the Shanghai Xin Dingxiang Tragedy Support Association.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Sends a Letter to the French Consul - To whom it may concern, according to a letter from the Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court, on the 21st of this month, the Shanghai New Customs Waitouma Road Water Patrol Police Station wrote that on the night of the 16th of this month, Sampan No. 130 at the Waitouma Road Wharf in Yangshu was loading Westerners onto a French ship anchored in Pudong. Because of an accident, he fell into the water and drowned. His body was found last night and sent to the Nanshi Life Saving Bureau for examination, etc. A copy of the report from the Deputy Constable Pengshang stated that after the accident, the French Chief Patrol sent a Chinese detective and a French police detective to board the French ship Sandu to investigate. It was found that three French sailors had left the ship on another sampan when the sampanman drowned. According to them, they saw two unknown navy personnel at the time. When one of them was about to board their sampan, the drowned boatman hugged him. The man pushed the boatman into the Huangpu River and drowned him. The Deputy Constable requested that the French Consul allow him to board the French warship Huatake Hao 滗 to identify the soldiers involved, but was rejected by the French naval authorities. The police officers boarded the ship, etc. Our office has sent personnel to examine the boatman Xin Dingxiang and confirm that he drowned. The case file has been filled out and the coffin has been sealed and handed over to the deceased's wife, Xin Shi, for burial. It has been found that the perpetrators in this case were two French navy personnel. As a general court, our office has no jurisdiction over this case according to law. Therefore, we are writing to inform you of the examination situation and hope that you will investigate and forward it to your country's naval authorities to find the murderer, punish him severely, and determine compensation to maintain friendly relations between our countries. We also hope to receive a reply. Respectfully submitted to Mr. Corklin, Consul General of France in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Various Unions Issue a Declaration to the Compatriots of the Whole Country - Xin Dingxiang, who was wrongfully drowned at the bottom of the sea, was young and strong and relied on his labor to survive. There are countless people in the Republic of China like Xin Dingxiang who rely on their labor to survive. How many are there in the world? How can we, the people in the territory of China, not be cautious and frightened by the fact that a boatman has suffered such a tragedy? If we are in the same boat in a storm, how can we feel at peace? Moreover, wherever the iron hooves of imperialism reach, they are assisted by gunboat policies and unequal treaties to commit crimes. Alas, my compatriots not only lie down and taste the bitterness, but also suffer from unexpected disasters that must be prevented at all times. Now, Xin Dingxiang has unfortunately been harmed by force. However, if the people of China are to be threatened by barbaric foreigners or within a colonial circle, how can they seek peace? Thinking of this, I cannot help but shudder. Recently, the French Consul General sent a letter to the municipal government with a light touch and evasive words, treating our people's lives as worthless. If a weak country has no diplomacy and the world has no justice, how can the French imperialists, who are trampling on our weak nation, talk about maintaining friendly relations? Our associations are filled with indignation and grief. It is extremely important to mend the fold after the sheep is lost and to draw firewood from under the cauldron. The only way to do this is to hope that the compatriots of the whole country will be invigorated and suppress the rampant forces. Together, we will urge the government to use revolutionary diplomatic methods to negotiate with the French authorities in a manner that is not妥洽 about the Xin case, so as to achieve the goals of punishing the murderer, apologizing, paying compensation, and providing support. And in the shortest possible time, we must recover the national concessions, abolish consular jurisdiction, withdraw the land and sea forces of various countries stationed in China, and abolish all unequal treaties, so that the precarious China may be saved. If we continue to hesitate, wait and see, and苟且伦安, then our people will have no survivors. We hereby declare (omitted below)</p>
<p>Host Journalists Tonight - The Xin Case Support Association will host journalists from the local press at the Fuxing Garden on Fuzhou Road tonight to expand publicity so that the whole country and the world can understand the oppression of weak nations by imperialism. It is reported that the invitations have already been sent out.</p>
<h3>Various Groups Form the Support Xiao Anti-Dutch Congress</h3>
<p>Date...November 26 Location...Tianhou Palace Bridge Chamber of Commerce, Overseas Chinese Federation, Overseas Chinese Affairs Association, and 19 other groups have decided to hold the Support Xiao Anti-Dutch Congress at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Palace Bridge at 1:00 pm on the 26th of this month. Yesterday, a letter was sent to all walks of life, stating that the news that our country's female teacher, Xiao Xin'an, was brutally raped by the chief mate and second mate of the Zhazha Company's steamer "Zhibade" in a planned and organized manner has aroused universal indignation. In addition, the Dutch government has historically killed tens of thousands of our overseas Chinese, imprisoned and deported countless of our party members, reporters, and teachers. In its governing regulations for the Dutch East Indies, it openly stipulates that Chinese are an inferior race and are in the same category as the 士番. This is even more unbearable. Our associations know that all walks of life in this city are the most passionate. We have decided to hold the Shanghai Anti-Dutch Congress, Support Xiao Xin'an Congress on November 26 (Wednesday) at 1:00 pm at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Palace Bridge (open to the public) to discuss various ways to help Ms. Xiao and relieve the suffering of the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. At that time, please send more representatives to the meeting for discussion. We would be most grateful.

She said that he was bullying him, a man from Guangxi, and the maid Zhou Amei also told him. Carol also personally saw their adultery. There was also a friend, Guo Zhaohai, who was an attendant in the photo studio. He also personally saw it. He was asked when he mentioned it. He replied August 16. He was asked how he caught them. He replied that the Public Security Bureau sent two police officers, and he had two friends, making five people, including him. He was asked what they looked like when they went. He replied that the maid got up early and the door was already open. He walked behind the police officer. He was asked if he went in through the front or back room. He replied that they were one floor up and one floor down and there was no front or back room. He went in and saw the two of them. Their house only had one floor and one pavilion room. He was asked which one he caught first. He replied that they were caught together. He was asked if he caught them alone or if the police caught them. He replied that they were caught together. He was asked if they got out of bed. He replied no. They only got up after he went in. He was asked which of the police officers went up to He Fenglin. He replied that he was under pressure. He was asked what pressure he was under since he was a police officer. He replied that that was the truth. He was asked why Zhou Amei also said she didn't say anything. He replied that she was being manipulated. He was asked why they didn't manipulate before since they had already manipulated afterwards. He replied that it was unclear.</p>
<p>He also had two things to say. On August 16 last year, he went to Hong Kong. After boarding the ship, he returned home at night. Zou Aizhen came to open the door. He saw Chen Genwei sleeping on the floor in her room. He had a big fight with Zou Aizhen. Also, he lived with Zou Aizhen for a week after May 15 last year. Unexpectedly, he received a letter in Hong Kong that a child was born around December 10. Now it is dead. It has not been seven months. If it was a premature birth, it would not be able to be raised. The official said that the month was already July, or due to congenital deficiencies. He replied that it was dead. He was extremely heartbroken and would commit suicide if he was not involved in litigation. The official said that death was absolutely impossible. It was not worth it. At this point, the witness Guo Zhaohai, 33 years old, from Yancheng, who was an attendant in the Queen's Photo Studio, was asked. Zou Aizhen and Chen Genwei had come together to ask him to pour two cups of tea. He did not see what they looked like. At this point, Zou Aizhen was asked how many years she had been married. She replied eight years. She was asked if it had always been good. She replied very good. She was asked when it started to be bad. She replied August 10 this year. He returned home. On the 14th, he said that he was from Guangxi and wanted to go to Guangxi, or get a divorce privately. We did not agree. She was asked why she wanted to divorce since it was so good. She replied that she listened to her friends. She was asked how friends could break up a family. She replied that after he moved out on the 14th, he came to catch her in adultery and was involved in litigation on the 16th. A friend named Xu was there. Chen Genwei was asked what he was to her. She replied dry brother. She was asked where he lived. She replied that she lived with her sister in the pavilion room, and her mother lived on the front floor. Chen lived on the back floor. Because it was hot, he lived with his mother on the front floor</p>
<p>Because there was a cool south wind. The photo studio was open, but he did not go often. If he went, it was to check the accounts. She was asked if Carol saw them. She replied that if they did something illegal, Carol would not be able to enter their room. She was asked how the adultery was caught on the 16th. She replied that she was sleeping when she heard a noise. She saw Chen Genwei and her sister on the escalator. She went out and was caught. They asked who her sister was. She admitted that she was her sister, so she was caught. Tang wanted to get a divorce, so he falsely accused them, and</p>
<p>People in the world were sleeping and scolding her. As for the birth of a child, she went to Yichang in March last year and lived with Tang for a week. She gave birth to a child on December 15. At this point, Chen Genwei was asked what his relationship with the Zou family was. He replied that he was an adopted son and went there at the age of twelve. His father died when he was six years old and his mother died when he was fourteen. He had married six years ago. At that time, he lived separately from his stepmother, but his wife died two years after marriage, and he lived with his stepmother again. He heard his stepmother say that Tang Huixuan came to falsely accuse him because he wanted to get a divorce. He was asked if there were many ways to get a divorce. Why did he use this dishonorable lawsuit? He replied that he did not understand. He was asked if it was inconvenient because the house was small and there were many people. He replied that it was convenient to eat. There was no ambiguity between him and Zou Aizhen. He was asked if a waiter said that they often went to the photo studio. He replied that they did not go out. He was asked where he was sleeping when he was caught on August 16. He replied that he was sick and sleeping on the back floor. Two people</p>
<p>Dragged him to the stairs. He saw Tang Huixuan and not long after, Zou Yuezhen was also dragged out. Tang went because Aizhen heard and came out and was caught. Because Tang wanted to get a divorce, he falsely accused them. The interrogation ended here, and the lawyers were ordered to debate. First, Shi Shuo said: (1) Carol's testimony was seen with her own eyes. (2) Guo Zhaohai's testimony often went to the defendant, although he presented two witnesses, one British and one Russian, but both claimed to be friends of Chen Genwei for five or seven years. Can he overturn Carol's testimony? If Chen Genwei was wronged, why would he want to wrong Zou Aizhen? Please abolish the original verdict, etc. Yuan Yang'an said</p>
<p>Tang Huixuan is very loyal. From his historical perspective, he is a Tsinghua graduate who studied in the United States at public expense. If he was not heartbroken, he would not have done this for a thousand reasons, and there is also the case of the Public Security Bureau, etc. The defendant's lawyer, Wang Deyi, said that the accusation must be based on facts. The witness Zhou Amei, who was brought up by the accuser, did not know the accuser, and since there was a home on Zhonghua Road where they could commit adultery, why would they go to the photo studio to commit adultery? There are many hotels in Shanghai, so why would they do it in their own photo studio and be seen by the photographer? This is beyond the bounds of reason. Yan Yinwu said that Tang Huixuan's confession was full of contradictions. For example, why didn't he live in the pavilion room? He asked if it was the kitchen downstairs. Living inside</p>
<p>The hot weather is like a steamer. Of course, the front building is cool. To appeal with this is unreasonable, and he first said that the police went upstairs together. The second time he said that he went up first, and the police said that Chen Genwei was wearing pajamas and Zou Aizhen was wearing shorts, and Tang said that Aizhen's upper body was bare, and the second time he said that the small clothes were not later, and then Carol flew in. All of them were unreasonable, so please maintain the original judgment. Jiang Yiping said that the principle of crime must be based on evidence, that is, to catch the adultery, you must also catch both, that is, Carol said in October that the two of them were naked in the small house, which is also an impossible thing. There is no chance for a secret meeting at home, so there is no need to set up a secret meeting place. Even if there is a co-exit, the criminal law only provides for a fixed-term imprisonment of not more than two years for a married woman who commits adultery with others. There is no reason for a married woman to go with others and be punished as above. The official then announced the end of the debate and implemented it at 2 PM on the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>Tan Meiying Divorce Case</h3>
<p>Opened for trial yesterday, crowded with listeners</p>
<p>Tan's intention is firm and difficult to reconcile</p>
<p>Zhao Guangzu still does not agree</p>
<p>The debate concluded and a date was set for the verdict. Zhao Guangzu and Tan Meiying have been married for less than ten months. Recently, Tan sued Zhao's concubine, Mei Fei Lao Jiu, for defrauding her of the property deeds, which Zhao was quite resentful of. His feelings for Tan gradually deteriorated, even resorting to violence.</p>
<p>Unable to bear the abuse, she filed for divorce in the Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou Daren opened the ninth court to hear the case. Both parties arrived at the court one after another after nine o'clock. Tan was wearing a dark velvet coat with a black leather collar and her hair was curled.</p>
<p>With a sad look on her face, she sat silently with two or three girlfriends waiting for the trial. Zhao was wearing a plain blue-gray gown with a fair face and looked like a handsome young man. Soon, Judge Zhou took the seat. This</p>
<p>A pair of estranged couples began to arrive at the court together. The court site was not wide and there were not many seats, but the men and women in the audience were extremely crowded and there was no place to stand. Judge Zhou first summoned the plaintiff, Tan Meiying, who testified that she was 22 years old, from Suzhou, and currently lived at No. 8 Chunhui Lane, West Gate. Zhao Guangzu is my husband. We were married on January 18 this year. I request</p>
<p>The reason for the divorce is purely because my husband has no profession and does not study. He is devoted to prostitution, eating big dishes, and watching plays. He always stays out at night and does not return home unless he changes clothes. Moreover, he is extremely violent and often beats and insults me for no reason, and he is heavily in debt. The creditors come to the door to demand payment, and I have to deal with it for him. For all these reasons, I have suffered a lot of pain, so</p>
<p>I request a divorce. Then, the defendant, Zhao Guangzu, was summoned, who testified that he was 23 years old, his father was from Baoshan, and he was born in Shanghai. He currently lives at No. 60 Huade Road. Tan Meiying is my wife. I cannot agree to her request for divorce now. What she said about beatings, etc., is completely untrue, and she</p>
<p>She manages the household affairs in an orderly manner, and I am very grateful to her. Judge Zhou then asked if he had a job. Zhao replied that he was now a deputy compradore in the Aetna Insurance Company at No. 17 The Bund and had just started working yesterday. He was also asked if he was wandering around outside. He replied that this was a thing of the past and that he had not indulged in pleasure since he married Tan. Judge Zhou then said to Tan, "Your husband has said that he will no longer set foot in the brothels and will not mistreat you. There is no need to ask for a divorce." Tan continued to testify that what her husband said was not credible.</p>
<p>On the night of their wedding, he did not return until 4 AM. He stayed out for several nights after that, and she had repeatedly advised him, but he never changed. She expected that this person was hopeless and forced her to do this. She also paid attention to the old morals and should abide by the meaning of a woman being loyal to one man to the end, so she would not marry again after the divorce and planned to study to</p>
<p>Serve the society in the future. Judge Zhou saw that her intention was very firm and difficult to persuade to reconcile, so he asked about the circumstances of being beaten by Zhao and whether there were any witnesses present. Tan said that the maid Gao Zhangshi knew all the details at the time. The court immediately ordered the maid to leave the court, and then asked the plaintiff to describe in detail the number of times and dates she had been beaten. Tan replied again that</p>
<p>She had been beaten a total of five times. The first time was in the middle of the night because the defendant still wanted to go out. She chased him to the escalator and stopped him, resulting in a slap in the face. The second time was also because the defendant wanted to go out. She hid the car keys, and he dragged her off the bed, slapped her in the face, and bit her with his mouth. The third time was also because she did not allow him to go out and stopped him at the foot of the escalator. The defendant then grabbed her hair and beat her violently. The dates of the first two times cannot be remembered. The third time was on July 25. On August 13, the defendant returned from outside and suddenly</p>
<p>Secretly took opium and committed suicide. She immediately called a Western doctor to the house to treat him. After the injection and medication, the doctor ordered that he should not be allowed to sleep soundly that night, so she woke him up whenever she saw him sleeping, and he slapped her in the face every time he woke up. On the second day, he secretly took Lysol water and committed suicide, saying that she should not have sold his car. She said to him at the time, "You only need to stay at home and not take a step out. If anyone comes to visit, I will tell them that</p>
<p>You are dead." Unexpectedly, she was beaten and insulted again. She had no hope for the defendant and decided to divorce him, otherwise the mental pain she would suffer would be endless. Judge Zhou then used the facts provided by Tan to interrogate Zhao, but Zhao only admitted to the quarrel on August 13, saying that at that time the plaintiff angrily destroyed the sundries, so he forcibly stopped her. As for the suicide, he said that he felt no</p>
<p>The joy of life and this idea was conceived, and he expressed that he would not mistreat the plaintiff in the future and would not wander around immoderately. The court again persuaded the plaintiff to abandon the claim for divorce because the reason for the plaintiff's request for divorce was only to point out that the defendant was indulging in prostitution and mistreating her, and Zhao had already repented in court, but Tan said that Zhao had broken his promise more than once and had previously written a document allowing</p>
<p>Divorce is really difficult to live with again. Judge Zhou then ordered the start of the debate. The plaintiff's lawyer requested that the divorce be granted according to law because there was no room for reconciliation, while the defendant's lawyer requested that the time be extended so that the two parties could still live together within the limit. If the situation could not be restored in the end, the judgment would be made again. Guo Huaipu did not</p>
<p>Express his opinion, saying that disagreements between husband and wife have a great impact on physiology, and that their impact is small enough to harm the family and weaken the nation. As for beating, it is not allowed by Chinese and foreign laws. In the United States, not only is divorce allowed, but the victim must also be compensated for the loss. The facts of this case are very clear. The prosecutor also hopes that both parties can still restore their feelings and cooperate to old age within a certain period of time. If they really cannot get along and are forced to get together, both will suffer, so it is better to let them fly away like swallows and terns. Judge Zhou finished the interrogation and announced that the verdict would be announced at 10 AM on the 27th of this month.</p>
<h3>Public Concession to No Longer Have Dog Racing Tracks Next Year</h3>
<p>Unofficial Notification from the Municipal Council</p>
<p>Dog Racing Venues to Close by the End of This Month</p>
<p>The Municipal Council of the Public Concession resolved to ban dog racing tracks at a board meeting last Wednesday, but the specific measures for the ban were not announced at the time, as reported in this newspaper. However, due to the silence of the Municipal Council's Chairman, Stirling Fessenden, and all the directors regarding the outcome of the previous board meeting, doubts arose from the outside world. Local newspapers such as the "Shanghai Times" further questioned the Municipal Council, arguing that such an important issue concerning the interests of the Concession should not be kept secret. Consequently, the Municipal Council only indirectly revealed the true news in the "North-China Daily News" yesterday. The Municipal Council's firm stance on banning dog racing has thus been confirmed. The two dog racing venues in the Public Concession, the Ming Garden and the Shen Garden, annually suspend dog racing from the end of November due to the cold weather, resuming in the spring when it warms up. However, this year, due to the Municipal Council's active anti-gambling campaign, it has unofficially notified the owners of the two dog racing venues to completely cease operations when racing stops at the end of this month, and not to resume dog racing next spring. The Municipal Council is currently in discussions with the dog racing venue owners based on this principle. The reports from the "North-China Daily News" and the "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" are translated and recorded below for reference.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports: "The Municipal Council of the Public Concession has officially notified the staff of the two dog racing venues within the Concession that they will be ordered to permanently cease operations after the end of the current dog racing season next month. This notification was made known to the dog racing staff during a meeting convened by the Municipal Council on Monday. It was also stated that the Municipal Council has no intention of treating dog racing harshly. Considering the interests of the Concession, dog racing is inevitably banned. The Municipal Council has given careful consideration to the reasonable proposals made by the two venues. The staff of the two venues did not express their opinions at the time, and it is expected that they will make some representations when the two parties continue their meeting next Monday."</p>
<p>Furthermore, a reporter from the "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" learned today (i.e., yesterday) that the Municipal Council anticipates that the dog racing venues will not take any legal action regarding this matter, and even if they resort to legal action, it is not to be feared, because the two dog racing venues have not obtained licenses. The Municipal Council can order their closure. Although the Shanghai Greyhound Racing Association, which operates the venues, is governed by British law, its members are not limited to citizens of one country and are also subject to the laws of other countries. Moreover, the racing at the venue has no legal basis. Otherwise, the Municipal Council could have taken legal action when it restricted the number of dog races in June of this year. According to those familiar with Shanghai affairs, entertainment venues and gambling establishments must obtain approval and signatures from both the Municipal Council and the relevant consul general in order to obtain a license. Therefore, if further complications arise, the Municipal Council can order them to obtain a license and require them to obtain the signatures of all the consuls of the countries to which the members belong. If this cannot be done, then the venue has no legal basis.</p>
<p>However, today (i.e., yesterday), the secretary of the Shanghai Race Club Ltd., Messrs. Thomsons &amp; Co., and the secretary of the Shanghai Greyhound Racing Association Ltd., Messrs. Creasy &amp; Co., issued a statement to the "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stating that regarding the dog racing news reported today in the "North-China Daily News" and the "Shanghai Times," they specifically declare that the two companies and their directors have not yet received any formal notification from the Municipal Council or its administrative staff regarding any imminent actions the Council plans to take.</p>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports: "It is heard that the Municipal Council of the Public Concession has firmly decided to ban dog racing within the Concession. However, the method of implementing this resolution is still under discussion and may not be announced for some time, as legal advice is still being sought. Formal discussions with the directors of the dog racing companies have also not been completed. The Municipal Council directors are quite determined to ban dog racing as soon as possible, because dog racing will be suspended by the end of this month due to the weather. It is considered not in the best interest of the citizens to allow it to continue next spring. It is heard that the Chinese director is extremely opposed to all forms of gambling. As for the foreign directors, the Japanese, who have the largest population in the Concession, have already been greatly harmed by dog racing. According to the results of a joint investigation by Japanese officials and leaders of the overseas Chinese community, 99 percent of the causes of crimes committed by Japanese residents are directly due to dog racing. Therefore, the Japanese are the most vocal in advocating for a ban. American residents have very little involvement with dog racing, but speaking for the entire American community, it is expected that they also support the ban. Therefore, at this time, those who do not support the ban on dog racing among Westerners are only a small minority, except for some who directly profit from dog racing."</p>
<h3>Japanese Automobile Accident Last Night</h3>
<p>Due to excessive speed, Three People Were Injured, and Chen Xiaogu Tragically Died</p>
<p>Chen Xiaogu, a 36-year-old Ningbo native residing at No. 1040 Ward Road (華德路), above the Sentaiho (森泰和) Charcoal Shop, sold snow cream (雪花膏) for a living. His cousin, Chen Zhonghe, a 17-year-old street vendor, rented a room at No. 517, Siwen Lane (斯文里), Dalian Bay Road (大連灣路). Last night, after dinner, they went to the Ming Garden dog racing track together. Around 11:00 PM, they left and were waiting for a tram at the Tofun Road (韜朋路) tram stop. Suddenly, a No. 2343 company car from the Morimura (森村) Automobile Company, opened by a Japanese man on Follen Road (斐倫路), came speeding by. Due to excessive speed, it caused a major accident, knocking several people to the ground. Chen sustained injuries to his waist and head and was in a critical condition. His cousin, Zhonghe, suffered injuries to both legs, and another person injured his buttocks. After a police officer arrived in response to a report, they were all taken to the Tongren Hospital (同仁醫院) by car for treatment. Unfortunately, Chen succumbed to his injuries within a quarter of an hour. The others were treated by doctors and then released.</p>
<h3>Private Artesian Wells Not Allowed to Sell Water</h3>
<p>The Public Utilities Bureau Orders Owners to Stop Supplying</p>
<p>A private artesian well has been established in Shunjin Lane (順金里), Feihong Road (飛虹路), Zhabei (閘北), to supply water to the residents of the lane. It also sells water to the tenants of No. 32 to No. 34, Lane 60, on the same road. Previously, the water was charged at a fixed rate of six dollars per month. Now, water meters have been installed, and the price is four dollars per 10,000 gallons, charged according to the meter reading. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has been reported that the owner's sale of water to tenants who are not owned by the same owner is in violation of Article 10 of the city's water supply regulations (private individuals may apply for permission to lay water pipes (i.e., water pipes) solely for the use of their own residences and tenants, but may not transfer or sell it). Therefore, the bureau immediately sent a letter to the owner of Shunjin Lane, ordering them to stop supplying well water to residents outside the property's boundaries within a specified period. At the same time, a letter was sent to the owners of No. 32 to No. 34, Lane 60, Feihong Road, ordering them to promptly connect to the Zhabei tap water supply in order to uphold the law.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Relocate to Xuejia浜</h3>
<p>Dou市街 (豆市街) Becomes Desolate</p>
<p>This spring, rice businesses in the Southern District (南市) constructed a dedicated rice wharf from Xuejia浜 (薛家浜) to the Santai Pier (三泰碼頭). It is now complete and began berthing ships from various ports arriving in Shanghai on the 15th of this month, all gathered at the wharf. For business and convenient measurement, more than a dozen rice shops on Dou市街 have rented premises at Xuejia浜 in the Southern District and established branches. All business operations have moved to the branches. Some merchants have moved their entire operations to the south. As a result, properties for rent at Xuejia浜 have been completely leased out. There are no more vacant properties to rent. The market has become lively. In the future, rice shops will be established in the Xuejia浜 area, gathering together to facilitate market transactions. However, Dou市街, which has always been the central hub of the rice market, has become unusually quiet and desolate since the merchants moved south to their branches, with business and transactions occurring at the branches. It is said that miscellaneous grain businesses will also move to the Xuejia浜 area in the future to facilitate loading and unloading at the wharf.</p>
<h3>"Chicken Ball" Fire Extinguishing Foam Tested Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>More Than 10,000 Visitors from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>The "Chicken Ball" brand fire extinguishing foam invented by Xue Zhenxiang (薛震祥) of the Zhendan Factory (震旦廠) has been previously demonstrated in the capital and other places, receiving high praise from all sectors. Yesterday afternoon, a larger-scale demonstration was held at the West Gate Public Sports Ground. The factory invited guests from all walks of life to attend.

<p>[Image Caption: Chicken Ball Brand Fire Extinguishing Foam Testing Demonstration. The inventor, Xue Zhenxiang, is in the right corner. Photograph courtesy of Xuehong Photography Studio.]</p>
<p>Director Yuan, representatives from various fire brigades, agencies, the press, and people from all walks of life. During the performance, Cai Renbao (蔡仁抱), the general representative of the factory, reported on everything. First, they demonstrated extinguishing fires involving oil and film. Then, they built a large wooden frame resembling a high-rise building. When it was burning vigorously, the foam was sprayed, and the fire was extinguished instantly. The spraying force of the foam reached 33 feet, and the foam expanded to more than twelve times its original volume after being sprayed out.</p>
<h3>Another Key Culprit in the Zhao Assassination Case: Xia Guangyao</h3>
<p>The mastermind behind the assassination of Zhao Tieqiao (趙鐵橋), the former director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Wang Jinshan (王近善, also known as Wang Xiaosanzi), and the perpetrator, Xia Shaoen (夏少恩), have been successively arrested by the city and county public security bureaus. The details of their confessions have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that another accomplice in the case, Xia Guangyao (夏光耀), who was selling red pills (opium) and had fled to Anhui, was arrested by detectives from the County Public Security Bureau at the Yingbin Hotel (迎賓旅館) outside the Dananmen (大南門) in Anqing (安慶), Anhui. He was escorted back to Shanghai on the Jianghua (江華) steamer for interrogation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Peng Daxun and Others Continue to Appeal Regarding the Fuchang Factory</h3>
<p>Peng Daxun (彭大勳), Liu Yuezhi (劉月志), and other family members of the victims of the Fuchang Military Uniform Factory disaster have repeatedly petitioned the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office to investigate the case according to the law through their attorney, Yan Lunkuai (嚴　魁), but have not yet received a summons. Peng and others believe that this case involves deaths with death certificates and injuries with injury certificates, and the facts are all present. It is not an ordinary criminal case that requires a long period of time for investigation. Therefore, they have again requested that attorney Yan draft a petition to continue pursuing the case. The petition is as follows:</p>
<p>Petition for Immediate Investigation of a Suspended Case</p>
<p>We, Daxun and others, are filing this case against Wu Desen (鄔德生) and others of the Fuchang Military Uniform Factory. We have repeatedly petitioned for an investigation, but have not yet received a summons. Recently, your office, as the primary agency for protecting human rights, should handle all cases it receives, not just the fire disaster case involving Daxun and others. However, this case involves the deaths of our family members with death certificates, injuries with injury certificates, and the defendant's liability for the crimes specified in Articles 187(2), 196, and 19(2) of the Criminal Code. This is very different from ordinary criminal cases that require a long period of investigation. Moreover, Daxun and others are living day-to-day in desperation. They have no power to resist the factory's pressure and lack the financial resources to maintain their daily lives. If they are burdened with litigation for a long time, the mental anguish and material losses they suffer will be unbearable. If they were to abandon the litigation, the grievances of the deceased would be buried at the bottom of the sea, and the sorrow and anger of the living would fill their chests. How could there be a proper resolution? Who does not have parents? Who does not have a spouse? Who would not be moved by such a great calamity? If we do not pursue legal action, we will not be able to face the deceased and appease public anger, and where will the laws of the country and the principles of heaven be? Therefore, we reiterate our grievances and humbly request your office to immediately issue a summons and resolve everything. Then, the entire families of Daxun and others, large and small, living and dead, children and grandchildren, will forever praise your virtues. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office.</p>
<p>Petitioners: Peng Daxun, Liu Yuezhi, and others.</p>

<h3>Grand Opening of the Continental Bank on Avenue Joffre</h3>
<p>The Continental Bank (大陸銀行) was established in 1919. In recent years, it has added savings operations, establishing widespread credit. A branch has been specially established at the corner of Avenue Joffre (霞飛路) and Rue Luber (呂班路) to benefit customers. This location is along the tram route connecting Xujiahui (徐家匯) and Lujiazui (盧家灣), providing extremely convenient transportation. At the opening on the 15th of this month, there were many congratulatory guests from all walks of life. Yu Youren (于右任), a member of the Central Committee, and He Fenglin (何豐林), the former Songhu Defense Commissioner, both presented grand paintings and plaques with the words "Trusted at Home and Abroad" (信孚中外). It is said that the bank's president has traveled to Europe, America, and Japan. To save customers' time, it adopts the latest European and American bookkeeping methods to ensure rapid deposits and withdrawals. It will also be open as usual every Saturday morning.</p>
<h3>Wheeler &amp; Co. to Begin Business Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Mr. White, the manager of Wheeler &amp; Co., has been appointed as the agent for Columbia Records and RCA Radio products. He is now also the agent for RCA Victor Records. Therefore, the company is the most perfect record company in Shanghai. The storefront at No. 20 Nanjing Road has also been expanded and is currently being decorated busily. According to Mr. Dilay, the general manager of the company, a large number of the latest records will be officially traded on the 24th of this month.</p>
<h3>Central National Medical Hall Hires Famous Doctors</h3>
<p>The Central National Medical Hall (中央國醫館) sent a letter to Dr. Xie Liheng (謝利恒) of Shanghai: "Respected Sir, since the inception of this hall, we have relied on the cooperation and support of outstanding individuals at home and abroad. We have long admired your talent, learning, and reputation in the medical field. At the second preparatory meeting of this hall, we respectfully requested that you join the ranks of the founders to work together on this undertaking. We will send you a letter to attend a future meeting to hear your great opinions and hope that you will provide guidance at any time so that we may follow it. We are greatly pleased." Dr. Xie is a senior figure in the Shanghai Medical School and a leader of the Medical Association, and is the author of the three-million-word "Dictionary of Chinese Medicine." The Central Government's recruitment of talent to organize everything and carry out construction can be seen in general.</p>
<h3>Fire at a Prostitute Brothel Kills Four-Month-Old Girl</h3>
<p>A fire broke out in a room on the second floor of No. 14, Tongkang Lane (同康里), Huacheng Road (華成路), in the French Concession, a prostitute brothel opened by Ding Xian (丁先). The fire brigade rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. At that time, Jin Gu (金顧氏), a woman from Yangzhou living there, was panicked and only managed to rescue her five-year-old daughter. Her four-month-old daughter, Xiaomaotou (小毛頭), was not rescued and perished in the fire. After the fire was extinguished, firefighters found the body, which was charred and unrecognizable. Patrol officers from No. 655 sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall (同仁輔元堂) for an autopsy. Yesterday, the criminal section of the French police reported the case to Judge Zhu (朱) of the French Court, who inspected the body and confirmed that it had been burned to death.

<h3>Zhou Qifeng Appealed Yesterday in the Double Hanging Case of Mother and Daughter</h3>
<p>Please Punish Liu Yingzhou with an Appropriate Sentence</p>
<p>Liu Yingzhou's doting on his concubine and mistreating his wife, neglecting her care, led to the tragic suicide of his wife and daughter. The District Court sentenced him to two months in prison for causing death by negligence. However, Zhou Qifeng (周企豐), the mother's relative, believes that the court cited the wrong law and the punishment was too light. Yesterday, he filed an appeal while simultaneously petitioning the Women's Association for assistance in punishing Liu with an appropriate sentence to uphold the law and redress the injustice. The text of his appeal is as follows:</p>
<p>Appellant: Zhou Qifeng</p>
<p>Regarding the Error in Law and Insufficient Sentence, Requesting an Appeal According to Law</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Zhou Qifeng suing Liu Yingzhou for abandonment causing death, a first-instance judgment has been issued sentencing him to two months in prison for causing death by negligence. This is difficult to accept in law and reason. Liu Yingzhou's doting on his concubine and mistreating his wife, neglecting her care, is evidenced by the victim's own written documents. Moreover, the human condition is to cherish life and hate death. If Liu Yingzhou had not abandoned the victim, who was unable to help herself, wouldn't she have been willing to die four times? Your esteemed prosecutor's office filed a public prosecution based on the article of abandonment causing death, which was not inappropriate. However, the original trial court's conviction for the crime of negligence is a mistake in the application of the law. Regarding the victim, family ties and eyes witnessed the tragic suicide of the victim and her daughter. If he is not punished with an appropriate sentence, it will not be enough to uphold the law. Therefore, I petition your esteemed prosecutor's office to file an appeal according to law to redress the injustice and punish the wicked. This is for the benefit of the public.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted to Wu (吳), Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court.</p>
<h3>Weng Jinying Accuses Her Husband of Kidnapping and Abandonment</h3>
<p>Demanding 40,000 Yuan for Alimony, Lawsuit Dismissed</p>
<p>Chen Yunling (陳運凌), a Cantonese man, is quite wealthy from the tea business. At the age of 51, he married Weng Jinying (翁金英), a 39-year-old woman from the same province. Soon after, he abandoned her. The woman filed a criminal lawsuit with the Special District Court, requesting that he be punished for kidnapping and abandonment and be ordered to pay 40,000 yuan in alimony. Judge Feng (馮) held a hearing yesterday. According to Weng's statement, she married Chen in the summer of the 13th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1924] at the Zhuangyuanlou (狀元樓) Restaurant in Zhonghongqiao (中虹橋) and held a banquet to invite guests. The defendant initially said that he had no wife, but after the marriage, she learned that Chen already had a wife and two concubines. She was deceived. But what was done, was done. Chen rented a room on the upper floor of the Zhou Fan residence (周范氏家) on Wuchang Road (武昌路) and lived with her. Later, she gave birth to a son. The defendant gradually grew tired of her. After she became ill, he stopped visiting her and abandoned her. Because she had no way to support herself, she had to sue. Weng's sister, Weng Guiying (翁桂英), testified that her father had listened to his stepmother and disregarded her sister's marriage, delaying it until she suffered this fate. She claimed that all the marriage certificates and invitations were lost due to moving. Zhou Fan also testified that Chen Yunling and Weng came to his house to rent a room. Chen Yunling admitted that he had an affair with Weng Jinying, who was introduced by a servant named Ah Gou (阿狗). At that time, Weng was a prostitute on Tiantong Road (天潼路). Judge Feng, after reviewing the testimony, determined that the case was not within the scope of a private prosecution and dismissed it. As for the private suit, the plaintiff should file a lawsuit in the Civil Court.</p>
<h3>Thorough Investigation of the Shooting Case at the Cai Family Residence</h3>
<p>Workers from the Mitsui Coal Company (三井煤棧) in Pudong (浦東) discharged polluted water into the river at the Cai family residence (蔡家宅). Villagers questioned them, and the Indian police officer of the coal company fired a shot to demonstrate. This matter is being thoroughly investigated. The Municipal Health Bureau heard about the case and, considering that the polluted water was harmful to health, ordered the Public Security Bureau to fill in the six polluted water ditches dug by the workers of the company and forbid the polluted water from flowing into the river again.</p>
<h3>Chen Shengtai Exposed for Using Counterfeit Money</h3>
<p>A Cantonese man named Chen Shengtai (陳生泰) recently came to Shanghai from Shantou (汕頭) carrying six one-hundred-yuan counterfeit banknotes from the Mercantile Bank (麥加利銀行) (totaling 600 yuan) and thirty-six ten-yuan counterfeit banknotes from the Bank of Communications (交通銀行) (totaling 360 yuan), hoping to use them in Shanghai. First, he resided at the Chunjiang Hotel (春江旅館) in the French Concession. However, due to the strict inspection of passengers by the police, he feared exposure and visited Wang (王), a relative of Dr. Wang Daoyi (王道醫) at No. 220 Avenue Joffre (霞飛路). However, Wang Chen (王陳氏), Dr. Wang's first wife, had already returned to Guangdong (粤). He only met Wang Xie (王謝氏), Dr. Wang's second wife. This was the first time Chen and Xie had met. After exchanging pleasantries, Chen spoke in detail about Wang's family situation, and Xie became deeply convinced. Chen then said that he had brought several hundred yuan with him to Shanghai to find a suitable job. As he spoke, he took out a paper packet containing several hundred yuan in banknotes, with the amount noted on the packet, and asked her to keep it for him. Xie did not suspect anything and immediately agreed. As for the contents of the packet, she could not tell whether they were genuine or counterfeit. She stored it for several days. Chen gradually took 360 yuan to spend outside. Xie did not interfere. However, a few days later, Chen was using the counterfeit money in the Hongkou area when someone noticed the flaw and immediately reported it to the Yangshupu Police Station (楊樹浦捕房), No. 1469. The headquarters dispatched police to arrest Chen on the spot. Three hundred yuan in counterfeit banknotes were found on his person. Chen confessed that all the counterfeit money was hidden in Dr. Wang's house. Police from the Yangshupu and French Concession police stations went to Wang's house, found 300 yuan in counterfeit banknotes, and arrested Wang Xie and took them to the police station. They were then transferred to the Special District Court. It is heard that Wang Xie has hired lawyer Huang Shaochang (黃紹裳) to defend them. A preliminary hearing was held in court the day before yesterday. Due to the seriousness of the case, Wang Xie was released on bail of 1,000 yuan to await further summons. Chen Shengtai remains in custody.</p>
<h3>Alarming Amount of Foreign Wheat Imported Over the Past Six Months</h3>
<p>The value is more than 40 million yuan. The amount of foreign wheat imported this year is the highest. Wheat has been loaded from both the United States and Australia. From May 1st to the present, over six months, a total of more than 400,000 tons of foreign wheat have been imported into Shanghai, and the amount of money flowing out for this item alone has reached more than 40 million yuan. It is heard that there are still 2 million bags of American wheat on the way to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Good News for the Local Weaving Industry</h3>
<p>The Municipal Industrial Products Testing Institute (市立工業物品試騐所) (No. 4, Hehe Lane (和合坊), Avenue Joffre) has achieved excellent results since it was established two years ago. The scale has gradually expanded. This year, it has added fabric testing. All kinds of fabrics (cloth, silk, satin, wool, flannel, socks, shirts, trousers, towels, blankets, etc.) can be tested for weight, density, tensile strength, wear resistance, elasticity, shrinkage, the number of warp and weft threads, whether the raw materials are pure, whether the colors are durable, and the amount of sizing, among other things. Manufacturers can follow the test results to select appropriate raw materials, improve weaving and dyeing techniques, or imitate finished products. Buyers can compare their needs and decide whether to buy. When market transactions encounter disputes over deteriorated materials or samples, the institute can also conduct tests to resolve the disputes. If manufacturers want to prove the superior quality of their products, the institute can also accept and issue certificates based on the test results.</p>
<h3>Pedestrian Hit by Car</h3>
<p>Yesterday evening, at around 5:00 PM, a man, Mr. Jia (甲), who sold blue cloth shirts and trousers, was walking on Zilai Street (紫萊街) near the Old North Gate (老北門) when a company car from Pan Qin Automobile Company (潘勤汽車公司), registration number 12095, sped by and knocked him down. He hit his head and bled profusely. Patrol officer No. 441 from the Great Self-Ringing Bell Police Station (大自鳴鐘捕房) arrived, recorded the car number, and sent the injured man to Renji Hospital (仁濟醫院) for treatment. According to the doctor, his injuries are serious and may be life-threatening.</p>
<h3>Notice: Lapel Badge Invalidated</h3>
<p>The No. 2946 lapel badge held by He Youde (何有德), a former third-class police officer of the Seventh District of the Wusong Public Security Bureau (吳　公安局), has been lost. The district fears that it may fall into the hands of bandits and cause accidents.

<h3>Tonight, a Western Orchestra Will Perform the Works of Chinese Musicians</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruogu</p>
<p>Composer………Mr. Huang Jinwu</p>
<p>Conductor………Mr. Mei Baiqi</p>
<p>Location……Grand Theater</p>
<p>Time……9 PM Tonight</p>
<p>Thank you for Mr. Huang Jinwu's kindness. We have never met, but I am grateful that he entrusted Mr. Huang Xincun to send me a ticket to the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra's symphony concert the day before yesterday. They invited me to listen to the concert on the night of November 23 because the program for that night's concert included a major work by Mr. Huang Jinwu called (Nostalgic Tune), an overture reminiscing about his deceased girlfriend, originally called "In Memoriam Overture." It will be performed under the direction of Italian musician Mario Paci by the entire Western orchestra. This is a major event breaking records in the Shanghai music scene. Like Mr. Tan Shuzhen's attendance at the orchestra's Beethoven Centennial Celebration two years ago to play the viola, it is a grand event that can arouse the attention of Chinese audiences.</p>
<p>Although I have not yet met Mr. Huang Jinwu, I have seen his photo in the booklet (Our Musical Friends) compiled and printed by Mr. Huang Xincun. He is a young and energetic man, about my age, but with glasses. His broad forehead seems to have already told me that he is a thoughtful and studious young musician. He is a graduate of Qinghua School and graduated from the music department of Oberlin College in the United States at the age of twenty-two. He then entered the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. In 1929, he obtained a Bachelor of Music degree from Yale University at the age of twenty-five. This (Nostalgic Tune) was the thesis work he submitted to obtain his bachelor's degree and was selected to be performed at the Yale University year-end music conference, receiving many good reviews in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao Youmei, the president of the National Conservatory of Music, admired his talent and specially appointed him as the director of academic affairs and professor of music theory, as well as the chief editor of (Music and Art Quarterly). Mr. Xiao also wrote an article (Huang Jinwu's Nostalgic Tune) this time, explaining it in detail (see the Youth Forum section of this newspaper on November 18). It is said that many copies have been mimeographed, presumably to be distributed at the concert hall tonight.</p>
<p>As for the artistic value of Mr. Huang Jinwu's musical piece, I dare not estimate it in advance because I have not heard it performed yet. However, Mr. Mei Baiqi, the conductor of the Municipal Council Orchestra, is an experienced and discerning musician. The fact that Mr. Huang Jinwu's thesis work has been selected to be included in the program of tonight's concert and officially performed publicly is not only a personal honor for the author, but also an excellent opportunity to win some glory for the Chinese youth music scene. I hope that those who love art</p>

<p>and are enthusiastic about the music movement will not miss this good opportunity tonight. November 22, 1930, under the lamp.</p>
<h3>Jian Guang Basketball Team</h3>
<p>— Yi De</p>
<p>Organized by Female Law School Students</p>
<p>Although the law school is not the leader in sports among universities in Shanghai, it pays exceptional attention to it. The school authorities spare no effort in promoting it. Recently, they specially opened a magnificent basketball court and purchased some sports equipment, such as net balls, rackets, and basketballs. Athletes uniformly wear blue velvet clothing. Sports meets are held every season, and various trophies are awarded. Students have also organized many teams themselves. Students' interest in sports is considerable. However, the female students seem too inactive.</p>
<p>It was in the autumn of last year, wasn't it? At the beginning of the semester, the authorities invited a female instructor, Ms. Qin Haoran, to lead the students in ball games. However, most of the ladies either arrived late or stayed in their high-rise buildings, reluctant to come out. They scattered in twos and threes on the playground, leaving Ms. Qin, who was famous in Shanghai, helpless. This situation, of course, did not last long. Since then, Ms. Qin has never been seen on the girls' sports field again. Female sports were declared bankrupt in an intangible way. For nearly a year, there was no sign of revival. Is it possible that none of the female students are good at sports? Is there no one with enthusiasm to lead the students in extracurricular ball games? I dare not make such a hasty judgment, or perhaps it is because they are shy and unwilling to step forward.</p>
<p>Now, a glimmer of hope has been discovered. This glimmer of hope, of course, comes from the right people. The people mentioned above who are good at sports and have enthusiasm are introduced briefly here. Ms. Xue Zhen, who transferred from Datong this semester, participated in the All-Jiangsu Province Games during her middle school years and won the runner-up in track and field. She is especially good at ball games. Ms. You Duan, Ms. Chen Shan, Ms. Lai Yazhen, and others are all good at sports and are skilled in ball games. With these ladies, it will not be difficult to expect the establishment of a ball team among the female students.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the initiators are, of course, the aforementioned ladies. After less than three days of preparation, it was officially established last night. More than two-thirds of all female students attended. Ms. Xue Zhen was elected as the chairperson, and Ms. Lü Jihua was the recorder. As a result of the election, Ms. Xue Zhen and Ms. You Duan were elected as the captains. Ms. Chen Shan, Ms. Lai Yazhen, Ms. Mao Chaoqun, and others were elected as executives. Ms. Lü Jihua was elected as the secretary, and Ms. Jin Guangju was elected as the public relations officer. Many items were discussed. At the end of the meeting, everyone said that the election of the captains proved that Ms. Xue and Ms. You were truly worthy of popular support.</p>

<h3>Reading Yu Jianhua's Solo Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Qian Jun</p>
<p>Recently, my interest has suddenly shifted to a fondness for calligraphy and painting. Whenever there is an opening of an exhibition, I make sure to take a trip there.</p>
<p>This time, it was Yu Jianhua's solo exhibition, and I went there as usual.</p>
<p>In my mind, I had already measured Yu's artistic talent, but perhaps I was too narrow-minded and had not measured it far enough. After observing the actual works, my assumptions were completely shattered, and I started a new and realistic assessment.</p>
<p>If his landscapes were to be judged by the standards of our ancient country, then, of course, we could use adjectives such as vigorous, ancient, majestic, solemn, clear, transcendent, etc., to praise them. However, I feel that it is too cheap and too pedantic to simply copy some ready-made words to explain his landscapes. We should observe his landscapes with a new perspective.</p>
<p>My intuition tells me that his vigorous talent makes it impossible for him not to explode into the epitome of landscape painting, eclipsing all contemporary artists and dominating the art scene after Wu Daitqiu.</p>
<p>Among the works in his solo exhibition, some of them have a style that is deeply similar to the works of Böcklin (a German idealist painter who admired death, known for his painting "The Isle of the Dead"). Although Western painting and Chinese painting cannot be discussed together, the expression of emotions should have something in common. Therefore, his works have quite a bit of the German genius' style, with the appearance of works with the beauty of quietude and death.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I am particularly interested in his technique of applying moss in his works. The scattered, multi-colored application of moss is not far from the pointillism of Signac and Seurat. We can recognize this as a new expression in Chinese painting, and we should praise it.</p>
<p>As for the mountains and rivers in his landscape paintings, they are incredibly steep and precipitous because he has traveled extensively to famous mountains and rivers. Therefore, he can dominate the world without any rivals.</p>
<p>As for the flowers, perhaps it is because of my different tastes that I don't want to say much. However, I have always admired the colors.</p>
<p>Our ancient country also has a strange art, which is calligraphy, which does not exist in other countries. Therefore, this thing is even more remarkable. I particularly love Yu's calligraphy, especially his seal script. When I look at his calligraphy, I feel the same supreme satisfaction as when I read Jun'ichirō Tanizaki's novels.</p>
<p>Therefore, Yu's solo exhibition provides us with abundant spiritual nourishment and is a sharp white light for the art scene, which is truly worthy of praise.</p>
