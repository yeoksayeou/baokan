<p>時評</p>
<h3>美國旱荒之救濟</h3>
<p>古人有云天災流行國家代有故無論其國家在興盛時期或衰頽時期而其不能免於天災則一也惟國家而在興盛時期則救濟易國家而在衰頽時期則救濟難耳即如美國此次之旱災初發見之時美國人民方不以爲禍而以爲幸蓋以美國近年以來農産之物供過於求即古人所謂榖賤傷農之意也在此時期而歲有歉收實足以調濟農産物之價值轉於農人爲有益迨後又知災情之重大極力從事於救濟如藉鐵路以運糧與草料不但使災區之人民不至缺食即災區之牲畜亦得生養而無恐一視一遇災害壯者散於四方老弱轉於溝壑之國其相去也遠矣</p>
<p>又如意大利此次因南方地震之故意相下令禁止捐募不但不受國外之接濟即其本國之人民亦不使其捐輸以爲政府之力足以救助之是誠不愧爲能負責任之政府也總之國家一患難最足以表現其國家之盛衰與國民性之特點而受災人民之苦樂亦於以别焉</p>

<p>赫哲民族清初有四百餘户估其人口在三千左右三百年來人口非惟不見蕃殖近且逐漸减少現祇餘五百多人其原因（一）該民族以漁獵爲生不知稼穡近日漢人移斯土開懇荒地砍伐林木其圍塲日蹙每次打圍所得鹿茸獸皮幾不足供給生活（二）其男女老少年齡在十七歲以上者十九嗜燒酒吸鴉片戕賊其身體因此所有出入大部浪費於烟酒兩項而生計更爲艱難（三）有疾病祗知跳神不信醫藥瘟疫流行有全家死亡者（四）其女子稍有姿色者均願嫁與漢人考其人口統計男多於女（五）女子多患疳血癆不易生育（六）嬰孩死亡率佔百分之八十至九十以上數端略舉其大者而以吸食鴉片爲最重大之原因鴉片足以亡國滅種赫哲人可爲國人前車之鑑昔日稱爲通古斯雄族之赫哲數十年後恐將絶跡於松花江畔矣</p>

<h3>陸稿薦之命名</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>海上肉肆競懸「真陸稿薦」之牌號初不知何所取義頃與友人唔談間以此詢之友曰相傳有蘇人陸某者設肉肆於巿特彼雖操屠業而生性慈和遇有貧困輒多施與一日肆中來一丐鳩形鵠面病骨支離陸某給以錢不受欲求屋角一席地以蔽風雨陸憐而許之與以藁薦一條用作墊身臥具且日給飲食不稍吝居月餘丐病巳痊廼向陸某辭去瀕行謂之曰感君厚德愧無以報請以此藁薦充燃料煑肉聊表寸心耳陸如其言行之忽釜中肉發異香播聞遠近羣來爭購生涯因以鼎盛故肉肆牌號咸襲用此美名云</p>
<h3>魚能聽乎</h3>
<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>魚有聽官能聞人言語動作與否之問題久爲魚學家討論之中心自來學說有二如安格蘭Anglers氏則以主張魚有聽官聞名於一時而一般動物學家則謂魚雖有耳惟不能用痛斥其說之荒謬兩方爭辯至今未巳魚能聽乎殊爲一極有趣之問題爰就最近之學說羅陳如左</p>
<p>聽樂辨食　最近德國茂立克大學有一名科學家曰施丹脫HerrHStertte者著有一文刋載於柏林各大報紙爲安格蘭氏擁護謂魚能聽音樂之聲也其根據即在彼數年來實地之試騐彼云其家中曾蓄有各種魚類於飼食之際日必雜以音樂或各種人聲日久之後聲浪一作雖無食魚之聽覺亦甚靈敏試先以某種聲音代表一種上等食品更以他種聲音代表一種惡劣不可食之物按時訓練日久之後魚聞某種聲音則四集聞他種聲音則漠然不爲動焉是則魚旣有聽官能聆聲樂且其聽覺靈敏亦能聆音而辨食矣</p>
<p>魚實無耳　然而持反對之論者亦實繁有徒倫敦一動物學專家曾謂某報記者曰余在動物院中向鉼類作種種之試騐而魚之能聽如施丹脫氏所言者余不信也試藏若身於魚缸之側以兩手相拍作聲魚在缸内泳水如故不爲動也然請君面水而立仍以兩手相拍作聲則羣魚咸集浮沈水面向君索食故余以謂魚有靈敏之視覺與觸覺而决無聽覺之可言也</p>
<p>魚能辨色　魚之有無聽官能聆辨聲音與否之問題雖尚有疑問然而魚之視覺則敏銳巳極實巳爲一公認之事實矣試以紅色之盤盛上等食料以飼之同時更以藍色之盤盛惡劣食品以與之久之魚見紅盤來則四集爭食藍盤至漠不爲動噫魚亦靈物也哉</p>

<h3>最近的英國文壇</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>今年底英國文壇可以說是有三件大事第一是戰爭小說底鬨動全國第二是文學家之去世的特别地多第三是詩人們底交紅運我們現在挨次來說</p>
<p>本年春季英國底戰爭小說又出了好幾本最好的一本恐怕要算「Hei　Privates　We」（這三個字底意思祗有英國丘八才懂得我們敬謝不敏譯不出來）據說要算是全世界歐戰小說中最好的一本這話當然是說比「西部前線平靜無事」還要好了不過全世界的人對這本書起勁的目前還只有英國一國（連愛爾蘭都不在内）作者是匿名的用了個「步兵一九○二二號」（PrivateI9022）的假名</p>
<p>後來有一個能幹的青年作家兼出版家出來反對了他出了一本小册子說大家把戰爭的事情節當作惡夢看待不當作歷史底一個片段這是不對的這本小册子倒居然很引起一些影響接着在日報上週報上無線電播音裏就有一班惡夢派和歷史派互相爭辯引爲得意結果是仍然没有個結論至於最偉大的英國戰事小說呢是到現在還没有産生將來會不會産生也没有人知道不過這個問題現在是大家覺得有點討厭了</p>
<p>勞倫斯之死</p>
<p>並不是一件出於意料的事情因爲他病重巳久不過英國輿論對於他的批評很不一律駡他是性慾狂的人也有贊他是空前絶後的也有這二者都是各有所偏平心而論他確是一個天才不過他晚年的作品裏有許多偏狹幸刻的地方作品本身底藝術價因此不免减少了善寫馬戲人物和法國生活的浪漫小說家洛克（W·J·（Locke）也是新近逝世的英國文壇名人之一他的作品很多而且很受歡迎趣味是有的深刻的意義却没有所以只能算是一個二三流的作家而巳</p>
<p>女小說家</p>
<p>去世的有二位一位是羅默威爾遜RomerWilson)美國的短篇小說編選家愛德華奥白林（EdwardObrien）底夫人她的逝世報紙上刋物上者一字未提然而有一個時候在幾年之前她是很出風頭的曾被認爲英國青年女作家中之最有希望的那時她的「社會之死」（（TheDeaehorSociety）獲得了英國最重要的文學獎「霍桑獎金」她的作品是將現代的主觀寫法的小說放在神仙故事般的氛圍氣裏所以别有一種風味可惜她後來不能達到大家底期望以至没没無聞地死了第二位女小說家是貝爾夫人（LedyBall）也是一個不很著名的小說家在英國翻譯界呢</p>
<p>英國最好的翻譯家</p>
<p>司各脫·孟克利夫（ScottMoncrieff）是去世了他是法國兩位大作家伯勞斯脫（MProust）和斯丹得爾（Stendhal）底翻譯者他的譯文不但是優美的翻譯簡直可以算是真的創作了譯文能夠好到這個地步真是不容易所以司各脫孟克利夫之死實在是英國翻譯界底一大損失</p>
<p>英國的文學評論向來是非常發達的文學評論的刋物種類多極了有季刋月刋有半月刋有週刋而最多的要算週刋評論週刋中年數最多資格最老的是「星期六評論」（TheSaturdayeview）但是這個週刋底内部最近發生問題了牽涉到編輯人底職權與人格上去一時竟成爲倫敦文壇底談論中心這事的真相是這樣的星期六評論底主筆本是巴列（GeraldBarry）不過巴列只是主筆而巳並不是這雜誌底老板今年春季這雜誌底老板改變了政治主張不徵求巴列底同意就在週刋上發表了一篇文章這種辦法在做老板的人當然是認以爲可的然而巴列却没有改變他的政治主張所以他以爲週刋老板底這種舉動是剥奪他的職權侮辱他的人格因此勃然大怒提出抗議立即辭職而且辭職的不但他一個人連所有的特約撰述者投稿者甚而至於書記打字員和校對都一齊辭職而且後來在半個月之内一個新的週刋</p>
<p>星期六評論</p>
<p>（The　Week　End　Review）不但是宣佈出版並且真的印了出來在幾天之内就全數售完一直到現在這個週刋還是非常地銷路好以前的「星期六評論」的老投稿人都替他作文章此外還有蕭伯納班奈特諸名人加入帮忙所以内容更爲精采比禮拜六評論更好巴利底獨立精神和毅力因此博得了許多贊美英國的週刋向來多是由有錢的政客做後臺老板所以編輯人和撰述人底言論都不免受拘束「星期六評論」的事件正是對於這種現象的一個極好的反抗因此得到許多人底同情</p>
<p>詩人們交運</p>
<p>是跟着前任桂冠詩人白列奇士（Dr　Beidgss）之死而來的白列奇士之死所引起的注意和大衆對於繼任桂冠詩人的懸測使英國幾個主要詩人們底作品銷路爲之大盛第一個交運的自然是梅士斐爾（JohnMaselield）新任的桂冠詩人了因爲這一轟傳他的詩集銷路比從前好了一倍此外在這當兒出版新詩集的詩人也都交運了亨伯爾脫·吳爾夫HumbertWolle）就是其中之一他的新著「非天堂的城」(AncelestialCity)得到各報各雜誌底又長又誇贊的評論因此也很替詩人們出了點風頭此外南非洲的詩人康貝爾（RoyCampbell）雖然也是英國人但因爲是詩壇上的新人物所以他的詩集「阿黛瑪司脫」（Adamarsto）好博得了不少好評</p>
<h3>世界文學的故事（一八五）</h3>
<p>— 美國約翰瑪西著胡仲持譯</p>
<p>第四十八章　亞美利加的論文和歷史</p>
<p>那文體雖有種種繁褥的修辭却是堅實而純粹的據他的同代人的證言則韋白斯特是具有效力深强的音聲和莊重的態度而給與深的印象的演說家對於政治底演說家——或對於亞美利加人——並不懷有過分的好意的喀萊爾也說到韋白斯特的「岩石似的力」哩他並不一定常獲勝利這是因爲他所處理的問題往往本質上脆弱的緣故然而在旣是世界的演說家又是文學者的人們之間他却佔得了確實的地位</p>
<p>林肯從他的生涯的極早時就使可稱讚的文體發達了他到達了那個程度是由於刻苦的用功並不是如成着一般底傳說的林肯故事所云似的由於奇蹟底地賜給無知的人的天禀的他極敏感極明智·謹慎·小心·耽於思索異常地禀受了被誤稱爲常識的那稀罕的東西於此還略略混和了迷信與豫言底幻影這就屬於歷史的政治家不倒是屬於文學的他的文體概略地被說明着了</p>
<p>請將葛的斯堡的演說（註一）再讀一下照牠那樣看作一篇短散文詩看作藝術上的作品罷他以寥寥數語將那瞬間的情緒表現着而且他是不施文飾不作高呌帶着爲了他所想望産出的效果細心計劃了的律吕以沈靜平穩的文體表現着那情緒的</p>
<p>註一　南北戰爭時林肯在大敗南軍的葛的斯堡之役臨陣發表的演說</p>
<p>林肯的文章大都在於認真的熱誠之中這是因爲他有着非解决不可的許多困雖問題的緣故然而他也有着不少的諧謔這是他的文章的鹽又是防範謀官職的人們及來煩擾者的實際的武器他爲了保護自巳使得他們發笑當他並不爲徵詢大家關於奴隷解放宣言的意見却爲報告自巳所决定的意思計召集了他的閣員時他首先就讀了數頁阿提默斯窩德（註二）的作品給他們聽然而他在戰爭開始以後由性質由事情看來却是和想對聽衆講滑稽話以獲得票選的機敏的政治家遠離的悲哀的人有確然的目的和人格者雖是有我們所不能贊同的政策的政治家也學言詞的使用法這是從表現術的研究學得的敎訓之一凱撤克倫威爾拿破侖俾士麥及林肯（記着我只是從學文學底見地纔將他們類集在一起的）是文體的適宜於自巳的工作而且適宜到這還未失去生命那樣的文體的巨匠於批評於藝術於生在我以爲極惡劣似的那過重的亞美利加主義的色彩我從牠離開來提示一句話給讀者想想罷世間一切的政治家中——請想起庇得迭士累利葛拉德士吞及法蘭西的誰來罷——林肯有着最美最强的文學底色彩哩</p>
<p>註二　亞美利加的諧謔家一八三四—一八六七</p>

<h3>杜鵑啼倦柳花飛</h3>
<p>— 楊企雲</p>
<p>建國月刋社印行</p>
<p>兩天前我從報紙上看到這樣底一則廣告「三民主義文藝的第一部創作杜鵑啼倦柳花飛出版」這是會如何地引動我喲但我當天適因窮忙糾纒着不能抽出一個買書的時間使它馬上來滿足我的慾望事實是這樣的我祗好熬着任其渴望了一天</p>
<p>到了昨天得着餘暇我就急急地去把這本三民主義文藝的第一部創作買了來在往書店的途中似乎祗覺得電車有意地和我刁難可是無論它怎樣地刁難而我的慾望遲早終究是滿足了老實不客氣地在歸途中坐在電車裏就一口氣地把它看了五分之一差不多等到了家裏的時候自然不管三七二十一底一切雜事就目不轉瞬地把它讀了個完畢</p>
<p>說「杜鵑啼倦柳花飛」是三民主義文藝的創作我想假使肯說它是含有民族主義文藝的色彩自然更要來得刻切些</p>
<p>「…上帝我這才參與了正式的巨大的戰鬥我爲這可愛的古民族而戰鬥我爲這可敬的悠久的歷史而戰鬥我爲這錦繡般地大好河山而戰鬥同時我也爲了掃除一切的封建餘毒而戰鬥</p>
<p>這不是明顯地流露出爲民族而奮鬥的精神嗎爲民族生存的戰爭我們是認爲必要的有價值的在本書第七節中更處處製造出這種力一種勇氣和毅力指示人生的前途都是光明的書中人初聲的言論是如何底夠感動人們呵他真像能給人們一種興奮使人們放開胸懷有胆量地活下去又能使人們忘記了人生的不幸了解了人生的真諦更能使徬徨歧途中的弱者丢開了原有的頽廢的思想走向積極的光明的人生大道看初聲和松青說的話竟然感動得松青哭了起了</p>
<p>松青自巳的命運要自巳來决定外來的壓迫並非全是不可抵抗的别人也無力帮助自巳决定命運幸福惟有自强自尊者才能得之松青你雖背水列陣孤注一擲你也值得一個人死也要死得痛快一點拖泥帶漿的死法祗是上帝給弱者的特别贈品松青我不相信你絶對無望我且相信你大有希望松青你的生命之火到那裏去了你不尋找嗎松青這是非常容易的事情呀你趕快找到你的生命之火燃燒起來松青我們怎樣誠懇地期待着切望着</p>
<p>人們的前途自然都是充滿着無限的希望無窮而偉大的事業小小的挫折些微的阻碍就能支配我們偉大的人生嗎近幾年來一般人對於許多的問題他們雖有相當的自覺自然同時在舊環境中是不允許有這種自由的舊環境中的潛勢力自然會處處來阻撓可是這班青年就没有方法了他們祗有覺悟的能力但没有奮鬥的勇氣結果就走上消極的一條路做行不由心的抵制所謂青年的時代病也就這樣地由一個一個地堆積成了松青就不能逃出這個例外「伊是個半新不舊的人物梏桎是曉得排去的名敎却不敢打破」她受初聲的猛烈的興奮劑迫得太緊了她祇能哭她仍是没有勇氣她仍是受着「陳舊的信用和誓言」束縛着因襲的頑固的舊觀念的梏桎不知道喪了多少有爲的青年「高談什麽革命不革命倒不如把這問題解决了實際些具體些」這確是我們中華民族性的病根「攻心爲上攻城次之」中國民族性改造運動就是一般文藝作家應當負起的偉大的使命</p>
<p>這是一部革命的文藝作品嗎我想誰又不得不同時承認它是一部戀愛的作品在鼓吹有意識的思想改革同時他又處處寫出細膩的純潔的戀愛他們是兩心相印但他們並不流顯在輕狂的動作與語言間他們祇存在心底深處彼此都了解得她願拿她的整個的靈魂來呈獻給他而她的用情是如何底深刻啊看她從家裏寄來的一封賀年信附着兩朶紅梅借花說巳寫得親麗深情之處怎能令受者忘懷喲</p>
<p>……初聲這兩朶梅花送給你怕你的鼻子早忘了二年前的香氣……初聲她的確是可愛她可愛不僅在浮動的暗香上面在她玉潔的心骨中在她冰堅的操守中……初聲請你把她好好地供養着你該時時瞧瞧她不要使她落寞但不許你接近她否則會使她受累甚至夭折……初聲你能跟她多久就多久你不要預先發愁怕她萎謝……初聲她雖是不作聲冷冷地對着你但她並不拒絶你的愛……但是初聲你儘管熱烈地愛着只是不要忘了不許接近她的一個條件……</p>
<p>受了這樣深性的享受假使換到一般的青年要是怎樣地流連而忘懷了他的偉大的使命喲可是我們書中的男主人他是不即不離地顯露在行動上他並不被熱烈的愛慾驅使着沈醉於美樂的享受中他仍不忘自巳的偉大的事業他得到救國救民的機會他毫不留戀他毫不畏縮他用快力斬亂麻的手段披荆翦棘一掃無餘他不管環境的何等纏綿纒綿的環境不足以阻止他的偉大的行程這權其輕重的時候他竟然下了這樣的决心「如其說對你個人要好是親愛無寗說只要希望你能爲人羣爲社會就犧牲了你自巳亦不足惜的這就是對你親愛」</p>
<p>總之本書是兼顧革命和戀愛的在喚起中心意識的時候更想從戀愛的寫叙中産生出生命的力不使太沉醉於熱烈的愛河中而亦不單寫枯操的言論在熱烈純潔的愛的進程中滲雜着有力的意識無形間使這種意識灌注到讀者的腦海裏去使讀者認識了人生應走的大道這點就是本書有價值的所在</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Relief for the American Drought</h3>
<p>An ancient saying goes, "Natural disasters prevail, and nations have them in every era." Therefore, whether a nation is in a period of prosperity or a period of decline, it cannot escape natural disasters. However, relief is easier when the country is in a period of prosperity, and relief is difficult when the country is in a period of decline. For example, when the American drought occurred this time, the American people did not initially see it as a disaster but as a blessing. This is because, in recent years, the supply of agricultural products in the United States has exceeded demand, which is what the ancients called "cheap grain hurting farmers." In this period, a year of poor harvest is enough to adjust the value of agricultural products, which is beneficial to farmers. Afterwards, they realized the seriousness of the disaster and tried their best to provide relief, such as using railways to transport grain and fodder, which not only ensured that the people in the disaster area would not lack food but also allowed the livestock in the disaster area to survive without fear. The difference between this and a country where the strong are scattered in all directions during a disaster and the old and weak are turned over to ditches and ravines is vast.</p>
<p>Also, in Italy this time, because of the earthquake in the south, they deliberately ordered a ban on donations, not only not accepting foreign aid but also not allowing their own people to donate, believing that the government's strength was enough to provide assistance. This is truly a government worthy of being able to take responsibility. In short, a country's hardship is most able to show its prosperity or decline and the characteristics of its national character, and the suffering or happiness of the affected people is also distinguished accordingly.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>He Yingqin is Responsible for Bandit Suppression Affairs in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>The National Government issued an order yesterday.</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>The National Government recently issued an order stating that Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi have long been places where bandits and communists emerge. The frequent mobilization of troops due to the country's many troubles has prevented the complete eradication of bandits and communists during the suppression of rebellion. Recently, Yan and Feng and other rebels have occupied territories and deployed party members to secretly go to various places to instigate trouble, making the power of bandits and communists in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi like a prairie fire. Each time they capture a city, they commit arson, murder, and exterminate humanity, which is truly like the Chuang and Xian of today. The disaster in Changsha this time is particularly heartbreaking. The government is concerned about the peace and tranquility of the three provinces and hopes to save our people from suffering. These ugly people should be completely suppressed. All bandit suppression matters in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are specially assigned to He Yingqin, Director of the Headquarters, to be responsible for handling. The garrison troops in each province are under the control and command of the director, who must quickly wipe out all the bandits and communists in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi to show the party-state's utmost intention to quell chaos and protect the people. This is the order. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Compilation of Military Reports from Various Parties</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>The official released a summary of telegrams from various parties: (1) According to reports, our army has completely cleared the enemy on the east bank of the Wei River. Not counting the enemy rebels who were forced into the Wei River and drowned, we captured over a thousand rebels, over a thousand rifles, over ten mortars each, eight machine guns, hundreds of broadswords, hand grenades, and a large amount of supplies. (2) According to reports, a part of our army has crossed the Wei River and advanced to Anqiu. Along the way, we captured over a hundred rebel rifles and dozens surrendered with their weapons. Our vanguard has now crossed Anqiu and is advancing victoriously. (3) According to reports, Wang Yuwen's rebel army in Ankang recently built a bridge over the Bai River and planned to escape to the north bank of the province, but was ambushed by our army from both sides. The pseudo-division commander Wang Yuwen was killed on the spot, and many camp and company commanders were captured. Over thirty mortars, two artillery pieces, and over a thousand rifles were seized. The rebel army in Ankang has been completely resolved. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Cantonese Troops Occupy Elephant Trunk Hill</p>
<h3>Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The Eighth Route Army occupied Elephant Trunk Hill in Guilin. The Guangxi army firmly defended the Old Man Peak outside the city and confronted each other for days without major battles. The Eighth Route Army took a monitoring attitude towards the Guangxi army, preventing it from fleeing to Hunan. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin Discusses the Current Situation</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>Hu Hanmin said that many of those who participated in the so-called expanded meeting in the north had their names forged. For example, Deng Zetorong, a comrade from Guangzhou, telegraphed recently stating that he had never been involved in this matter. This proves that Deng is not the only one whose name was forged. Those current officials and party members of our party who have rebelled will be handed over to the Central Supervisory Committee for punishment after investigation and confirmation. Regarding the two losses of Changsha, the Hunan authorities allowed the Guangxi army to enter the city the first time due to bandit suppression. The second time, the communist bandits took advantage of the pursuit of the Guangxi army and re-entered the city. The defenders are responsible for the loss of the city. The Hunan authorities cannot shirk responsibility for the lack of prior defense procedures. However, they have tried their best to recover the situation afterwards. Furthermore, the upstream waters were shallow at the time, and the reinforcements led by Liu Jianxu and others could not arrive on time. Combining various reasons caused this drama. The central government is now sending personnel to Hunan to investigate the actual situation and plan for consolation and post-disaster work. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>Hu Hanmin expressed that the Communist bandits burned the consulates in Changsha this time to provoke international disputes and embarrass our party government. This plan is extremely vicious. However, we firmly believe that the governments of all countries are very clear about the truth of the facts. This kind of stirring by the Communist Party exposes its crimes to the governments of all countries and gives them a new understanding. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Hunanese Request Urgent Relief</p>

The administration is now proposing the following general methods: 1. The second-class post office originally located in Weihaiwei city will be converted into a branch and allowed to open savings. The post office in the commercial port outside the city and the Liugong Island branch have a lot of international remittances and are planned to be upgraded to open savings and remittances. 2. The original Chinese staff should be incorporated into the post office employee class for continued employment, taking into account the circumstances. The original furniture should also be accepted as appropriate. 3. The Ministry of Communications should consult the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to transfer the handling of the postal bureau's houses. After the Weihaiwei commissioner takes over, he will select an appropriate location and allocate suitable houses for the post office to use for office work. 4. Liugong Island has a wide sea area and requires a small steamship to transport mail. In the future, if ships are transferred, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should also be consulted to allocate them. (8th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>The German Parliament Elections are Not Far Away</p>
<p>The Government and People Are Focusing Their Efforts</p>
<p>Extremists Clash Several Times</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Berlin, July 7th</h3>
<p>The German parliamentary election, scheduled for September 14th, is fast approaching. Consequently, the energies of both the government and the opposition are almost entirely focused on it. The extreme left and right factions are constantly causing disturbances, often leading to bloodshed. Other parties, however, are very calm, consistently focusing on explaining their parties' methods for overcoming political and economic difficulties to the voters, and refraining from mutual attacks. Except for the Center (Catholic) Party, which supports the stance of its leader, Brüning, all other parties have expressed their strong opposition to the existence of this emergency tax decree. From the right-wing National People's Party to the left-wing Social Democratic Party, all believe that after the new parliament is established, fundamental reforms to taxation and administration must be immediately carried out. As for the future election results and the strength of each party, it is impossible to predict at this time. However, those familiar with the political situation mostly believe that the next cabinet will very likely include the Social Democratic Party, otherwise the government will not be able to maintain a majority in parliament.</p>

<p>Deterioration of Relations Between the Japanese Government and the Privy Council</p>
<p>Chief Secretary Niijo's Overly Critical Attitude</p>
<p>President Kuratomi Loses Face Greatly</p>
<h3>Dentsu, Tokyo, August 8th</h3>
<p>Regarding the circumstances of Privy Council President Kuratomi's request for the presentation of the "奉答文" (Imperial Rescript Response Document), and Chief Secretary Niijo's overly critical review of the treaty, pointing out translation errors, the government side revealed a mocking tone to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and showed a challenging attitude. This greatly offended Kuratomi and Niijo. As a result, the government's relationship with the Privy Council suddenly deteriorated.</p>
<h3>Japan United Press, Tokyo, August 8th</h3>
<p>Regarding the relationship between the government and the Privy Council concerning the Imperial Rescript Response Document, the third meeting between Hamaguchi and Kuratomi has brought it to a temporary halt. The Privy Council's request for the government to present the Imperial Rescript Response Document was not the wish of all the Privy Council advisors, nor was it necessary for the review. However, the Privy Council has consistently attacked the government, and this time it was also prepared to attack. They had already collected and thoroughly understood the content of the Imperial Rescript Response Document, intending to use it as material for attack. However, fearing being questioned by the government about its source, they specifically had President Kuratomi formally request its presentation. However, the result was that the government directly refused, causing President Kuratomi to lose face completely. The fair-minded advisors in the Privy Council are very dissatisfied with the imprudent actions of the President, Vice President, and Chief Secretary. In order to save face, the anti-government faction intends to raise other difficult issues for the government. From this perspective, the political atmosphere before and after the first review committee meeting is bound to become tense. Premier Hamaguchi and other members of the government are determined to confront the Privy Council with a firm resolve. Will the government fall, or will a major reform of the Privy Council be realized? The future of this issue is of great political interest.</p>
<p>Decline in US-China Trade</p>
<p>Committee Organized to Investigate the Truth</p>
<h3>Associated Press, Washington, July 7th</h3>
<p>Mr. Littlejohn, the chairman of the investigation committee that will begin soliciting public opinions on the state of trade between China and the United States and the impact of the low silver prices on Friday, issued a statement today. Any correctable unfavorable conditions will be listed one by one in the Sino-American agreement. In order to thoroughly resolve today's problems in China, it is feared that it is necessary for the contracting countries and China to re-sign a treaty, not relying on the opinions of American businessmen. According to him, there are two reasons for the sharp drop in trade between the United States and China in the first five months of 1930, a decrease of 17 million gold dollars: one is the war in China, and the other is the drastic fall in the price of silver. According to reports, the committee led by Littlejohn will soon travel around Los Angeles, Seattle, Reno, Salt Lake City, New York, and Aaron, inviting prominent figures from the banking, economic, shipping, education, and other sectors in each of these places to explore opinions in order to obtain detailed and accurate information.</p>
<p>Situation of Our Country's Representatives Attending the International Law Conference</p>
<p>Striving for Nationality Issues</p>
<p>Seeking Guarantees for Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Voting Results Ultimately Uphold the Original Proposal</p>
<p>Washington Correspondence From March 13th to April 12th of this year, the first compilation of the International Law Conference was held in The Hague. Our country specially appointed Minister to the United States Wu Chaoshu as the plenipotentiary representative. One of the topics of the conference was nationality. Our representative Wu paid special attention to it because the issue of nationality is closely related to overseas Chinese. He spoke many times in the meeting, mostly related to protecting the interests of overseas Chinese. For example, one article of the draft convention stipulated that if a person has the nationality of both country A and country B, and is residing in country B, then country A cannot provide diplomatic protection to country B. For example, if an overseas Chinese is born in a foreign country, the foreign country recognizes them as Chinese, and China also recognizes them as Chinese. If that foreign country mistreats the overseas Chinese, then the Chinese government cannot protect them. Representative Wu strongly opposed this, giving a speech at the conference stating that overseas Chinese often form their own groups in foreign countries, with a large number of people, language, and culture that are the same as their mother country. They consider themselves to be Chinese, and Chinese people also consider them to be Chinese and protect them. Even the host country often tacitly acknowledges that they are Chinese. This can be seen from the special laws applicable to overseas Chinese. Therefore, the Chinese government cannot abandon and must provide diplomatic protection to overseas Chinese. If it is said that this argument is close to infringing on the sovereignty of country B, then recent international treaties protect minorities for reasons similar to my argument. Moreover, overseas Chinese in foreign countries are not only numerous, but often several times more numerous than the indigenous people, and are also simultaneously Chinese. Therefore, the reasons for protecting them are even more sufficient than protecting minorities. Therefore, Representative Wu advocated completely abolishing the original draft. Most of the representatives of various countries advocated maintaining the original proposal. In the voting results, nine countries advocated abolition. Our country will reserve the right to sign this article in the future. In addition, Representative Wu also stated at the meeting that countries, etc., discriminate, restrict, or bind our people due to national, ethnic, or religious reasons. He stated that this kind of restriction is often a hidden cause of international conflict and should be eliminated. In addition, the nationality laws of various countries have particularly easy naturalization procedures, and unscrupulous people in our country often use them to obtain the protection of consular jurisdiction, and it is hoped that there will be restrictions on this. Regarding the application of the law to people with dual nationality in third countries, it is advocated that the decision should be based on the person's free will and choice. Regarding the nationality of children born on ships, it is advocated that these children should not acquire the nationality of the country to which the ship belongs, but should acquire the nationality of their parents. Regarding the nationality of married women, it is advocated that their nationality should not be transferred with the nationality of their husbands, and that they should be given the opportunity to choose for themselves to show gender equality. Although many of the above arguments could not be passed due to the different situations of various countries and China, or because the governments of various countries failed to be open-minded, they are still sufficient to show the Chinese delegation's upright arguments and fighting spirit, especially their intention to protect the interests of millions of overseas Chinese everywhere.

The United States must transport its million bales of unmanageable cotton to Japan, and Japan must export its 200,000 bales of overproduced raw silk to the United States. Both should agree to pay later. The United States must also break its coffers and continuously release funds for projects to find a solution." The cabinet members were surprised to hear this.

<h3>Telegram from the Hunan Provincial Association in Beijing</h3>
<p>To the newspaper offices in Shanghai, the gentlemen from Hunan Province in Shanghai, and the gentlemen from Hunan Province in various provinces: The communist bandits' capture of Changsha, burning, looting, and killing is too tragic to bear. The Hunan people in Beijing are filled with grief and indignation. Therefore, on August 4th, a provincial association meeting was held at the Hunan Guild Hall in Beijing to discuss and unanimously decide on measures, which have been reported in the newspapers. Now, the micro-telegram presented to Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek reads: "Commander-in-Chief Chiang, Commander in the Willow River Area, according to reports from Hunan refugees fleeing to Beijing, the communist bandits captured Changsha with the combined forces of five units on the date reported last month. He Jian, the commander of the four routes, was defeated and retreated from the city, and his whereabouts are unknown. After the bandits entered the city, they burned all agencies, schools, consulates, churches, and prosperous streets and prosperous residences. The fire raged for several days. All service personnel who did not escape were killed, and the number of people who died is impossible to ascertain. As for extorting money and forcibly looting items, seeking to preserve one's life and family is considered a temporary blessing. It is said that the people pay taxes to support the soldiers, but the soldiers shrink back and cannot defend against the bandits. In times of emergency, the strong follow the bandits, and the weak carry weapons and flee, abandoning the people to tigers and wolves. The border officials in charge of guarding the country are indifferent. The officials in charge of the entire province only seek to protect themselves. Although rewards and punishments are considered by the Central Government, the people who are destroyed by the army chiefs and bandits are almost extinct. Now the momentum of the communist bandits has already spread like wildfire. Changsha has fallen, and Hubei is shocked. It is said that the communist bandits originally had tens of thousands of firearms. After entering Changsha, they obtained another five to six thousand Zhang Gui firearms and six hundred thousand rounds of ammunition confiscated from the Fourth Route Army. There are many different categories such as spear and broadsword teams, and the number is immeasurable. If this continues to spread, the harm will be endless. The Hunan people in Beijing gathered together on August 4th and unanimously agreed that the urgent task at hand is to request troops to recover Changsha and then plan for the aftermath. Therefore, we tearfully implore you to quickly send heavy troops to Hunan to quell this great chaos. Not only will the people of Hunan be saved from fire and water, but the hidden worries of the overall situation will be eliminated. If there is anything appropriate, please respectfully wait for your judgment. The Hunan Provincial Association in Beijing bows to you." Please consider and provide mutual assistance to achieve the goal. The Hunan Provincial Association in Beijing.</p>

<h3>The National Government Bans the Manufacture of Morphine in Sichuan Province</h3>
<p>Orders Liu Xiang to Investigate and Punish</p>
<p>The National Government yesterday specially ordered Liu Xiang, the commander of the 21st Army, to investigate and ban the morphine manufacturing plants in Chongqing, Wanxian, and Fuzhou. The order stated, "According to the Executive Yuan's report, the Hubei Provincial Government reported that Zhao Tiegong, the magistrate of Yichang County and chairman of the municipal council, reported that the harm of morphine is extremely pervasive, and earnestly requests a strict ban to save the people's lives and strengthen the race. It is true that opium is more harmful than floods and beasts, and morphine is the essence of opium juice, and its harm is even more than opium ten thousand times over. If a person becomes addicted to this vice, they will become chronically ill and unable to recover within three years. It has been found that in recent years, large factories have been opened in Chongqing, Wanxian, and Fuzhou, collecting opium from all over Sichuan and neighboring provinces to extract the essence to make morphine. It is light, convenient, and easy to transport and sell. As the border areas connect to Sichuan, they are transportation hubs, leading to an increasingly rampant poison flame and boiling resentment from the people. It was proposed at the 33rd regular meeting of the council for detailed discussion, and a unanimous resolution was immediately made: (1) Report to the provincial government and forward it to the central government, ordering Liu Xiang, the commander of the 21st Army in Chongqing, and Wang Lingji, the commander of the 3rd Division of the 21st Army in Wanxian, to prohibit the opening of morphine manufacturing plants. (2) Send letters to Commander Liu and Commander Wang to strictly prohibit manufacturing. (3) Notify all agencies in the city to strictly prohibit sales. (4) Confiscate morphine and punish it at one-half of the original price to be used as a bonus. In addition to separate letters, this case is recorded and submitted to your government for review and approval to strictly prohibit and forward it to the central government to order Liu Xiang, the commander of the 21st Army in Chongqing, and Wang Lingji, the commander of the 3rd Division of the 21st Army in Wanxian, to strictly prohibit it as a public convenience. Based on this, in addition to instructing that the report is known, it is found that morphine and opium are banned together, and the smoking ban law stipulates it clearly. How can they be allowed to set up factories for manufacturing? According to the previous report, in addition to reporting to the central government to instruct the cessation of the establishment of factories for manufacturing and ordering the Ministry of Civil Affairs to inform all counties and cities to strictly prohibit sales, you should know and obey this order. Print and distribute and order the Ministry of Civil Affairs to comply with it. It is reasonable to submit a document to your government for review and approval, ordering the military and political leaders of Sichuan to quickly order their subordinates to stop the opening of morphine manufacturing plants in order to save the people's lives. It is a public convenience, etc. Based on this, it seems that it should be approved as requested. In addition to instructions, a document is prepared and submitted to your government for review and approval, ordering Liu, the commander of the Chongqing Army in Sichuan, to order his subordinates to strictly prohibit it in accordance with the provisions of the smoking ban law and punish them, and forward it to his subordinates to strictly prohibit any further harm."</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Requests Regulations on the Scope of Prohibited Exports of Ancient Books</h3>
<p>Ancient books have complex editions and are difficult to identify.</p>
<p>Customs officials may find it difficult to implement.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen yesterday presented a special report to the Executive Yuan on the issue of prohibiting the export of ancient books, requesting approval of the prohibited scope. The original text is as follows: "I respectfully received your Yuan's Order No. 2267, stating that the five major cases decided by the Executive Committee of the Chinese Library Association have been examined by the Ministry of Education and their opinions have been added, and the report has been submitted by the Yuan to the National Government for instructions. After checking the attached documents, the Ministry found that the third item, preventing the outflow of ancient books from the country, has been examined by the Ministry of Education to require strict inspections at all ports and transportation agencies to prohibit transportation and export, originally to preserve ancient books. However, our country is the oldest country in terms of culture, and there are many types of circulated printed books. Not only are the books printed in the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties the most valuable, but also the various palace editions and rare books printed in the former Qing dynasty are also rarely seen in recent times. Now that we want to prohibit the outflow of nationality from the country, what standard should be used to determine which era's books are prohibited from export? Moreover, the types of editions of books are extremely complex. To distinguish when a book was published and in what era it was printed, only scholars with archaeological expertise can do it. Customs officials may not have this knowledge and will find it difficult to implement. The Ministry believes that it seems that the scope should be clearly defined by your Yuan and it should be stated that in the future, in addition to lithographic, photolithographic, and letterpress printed books being allowed for transportation, all Chinese woodblock printed thread-bound books within the defined scope should be prohibited from being transported out of the country. This is the fundamental way to preserve the national essence, and it will be easier for customs to implement. All reasons for requesting approval of the scope of prohibited export books are reported to your Yuan for review and implementation, and a directive is requested for compliance."</p>
<h3>The Situation on the Jiaoji Railway is Tense Again</h3>
<p>Qingdao Communication: The Jiaoji Railway war has been in a state of confrontation between the two armies on both sides of the Huai River, west of Zuoshan Station, since the 28th of last month. Neither side has attacked, and it seems to have entered a truce. At present, the Jin army has received a large number of reinforcements, and the Han army is also eager to try because the central reinforcements have arrived. Therefore, the situation has become tense again in the past two days. The two armies are still confronting each other across the Huai River on the front line. The Han army is guarding Zuoshan Station, and the Jin army is between Nanliu and Huangsuobao. After the central reinforcements arrived at the front line, the Han army took over the right wing and handed over the left wing to Li Yunheng's army. At dawn on the 4th, the Jin army came into contact with the Han army again, but the Jin army retreated shortly after the fierce battle. It is expected that there will be a major battle within the next few days. (August 5th)</p>
<h3>The Aviation Team Stationed in Hankou Assists in Suppressing Communist Bandits in Hunan and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Hankou Communication: The Aviation Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs has more than ten aircrafts, including fighter planes, reconnaissance planes, and training planes, stationed in Hankou. Recently, several new aircrafts have been added, and the total number of aircrafts is twenty. In addition to most of them being sent to Luohe and Guide to work on the front line, there are still eight fighter planes and reconnaissance planes stationed in Hankou as a reserve team, serving as reconnaissance for the bandit situation in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, and assisting the army in bombing the communist bandits. Since Changsha was occupied by the communist bandit Peng Dehuai, although the beginning of this month has been cloudy and overcast, making it difficult to fly, the team's planes still bravely advanced and worked hard, reporting the situation obtained from reconnaissance near Changsha and in Pingjiang, Liuyang, Xiaogan, and Huayuan to the Xingying to facilitate military operations. Therefore, Changsha was recaptured within a few days. Today (August 7th) at 6:00 AM, Zhang Yougu, the captain of the 1st Aviation Team, along with pilot Zhong Liren, and pilot Lv Zhenxian, along with Yuan Keming, and Qin Shifan, a pilot of the 5th Aviation Team, along with Dong Shixian, six people drove three new Terkroce aircraft and a Junkers seaplane each, carrying several bombs, and flew separately to Changsha and Pingjiang, Liuyang, Tongcheng, Chongyang, etc. to conduct reconnaissance and bombing. At 12:00 noon, after completing their work in the sweltering heat, they returned to Hankou one after another. According to them, there are no traces of bandits near Changsha at present. The bandits fled in two routes, one towards Pingjiang and Liuyang, and the other towards Liling and Hengshan. Their clothes were disheveled, with gray, blue, black, and white colors. Their appearance was unbearable to look at. The vanguard of our pursuing troops, about a battalion, has tracked them to Ma'anshan. Another regiment of our army crossed the river from Nanjiang Bridge to the west, seemingly pursuing them to Miluo. About four or five hundred fleeing bandits were advancing in a chaotic manner more than ten miles southwest of Yijiawan. When a 60-pound bomb was dropped, the bandits fled in all directions. There were also bandit traces in various villages along the way from Pingjiang to Liuyang, with varying numbers of people. Several villages were burned by the bandits. There were also many bandits in Liuyang City. A bomb was dropped in a temple in the city, which immediately exploded, killing more than a dozen bandits. As for Tongcheng and Chongyang counties, they were all peaceful and there was no bandit situation.</p>
<p>According to Xingying news, because Changsha has been recaptured, the Xiangjiang seaplane of the 5th Aviation Team needs to be stationed in Changsha to conduct reconnaissance of the bandit situation and bombing the communist bandits at any time. Therefore, the team was ordered to send personnel to fly the aircraft there as soon as possible, and instructed them to transport a part of the personnel and oil and ammunition materials to Hunan for replenishment. In addition, in order to prevent unforeseen circumstances and assist the army in severely suppressing them, due to the news that the Zhu-Mao communist bandits were constantly causing disturbances in De'an and Tianjiazhen near Nanchang, it was specially ordered that the 1st and 5th Aviation Teams dispatch three new fighter planes tomorrow morning, carrying bombs, to conduct reconnaissance and bombing in the area near De'an, Qishui, and Chuntianjiazhen.

<h3>Rescuing the Declining Value of Jiangxi Circulating Currency</h3>
<p>The Department of Finance Convenes Financial Circles and Resolves Seven Measures</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Due to rampant bandits and poor harvests in Jiangxi, the Department of Finance's income was less than one-tenth or one-twelfth of the budget (monthly budgeted income was about 1.1 million yuan, but actual income was less than 100,000 yuan). Government expenses were heavily in arrears, so the Department issued 1.2 million yuan of circulating currency, using salt surtax as the redemption fund, redeeming about 100,000 yuan each month. Since its issuance in March, it has been redeemed three times, so its use in the market was quite convenient. However, in recent months, the Department of Finance's income has not improved, remaining at around 100,000 yuan per month. In June, the circulating currency fund was diverted to military expenses due to military emergencies, and the currency due could not be redeemed, causing the price to fall daily to 60-70% of its face value. Subsequently, the Department of Finance convened a meeting with business circles and decided that, in addition to the long-term circulating currency (redeemable next year) being sealed up by Yumin Municipal and other banks and various industries, the several hundred thousand yuan circulating in the market would all be treated as cash, and all tax collection agencies must accept it at face value. Therefore, the value of this currency increased daily. However, in the latter half of last month, the communist bandits Zhu De and Mao Zedong captured Zhangshu and Gao'an, and invaded Xishan and Shengmi areas near Nanchang. Public sentiment was unsettled, and the financial sector was the first to be affected. The price of this circulating currency fell daily again. By the 24th and 25th, it could still be used at 60-70% of its face value, but by the end of the month and the beginning of this month, the market completely stopped using it, causing financial chaos. Government employees and ordinary people holding the circulating currency could not buy anything, which was equivalent to waste paper, and everyone was complaining. In recent days, the communist bandits have retreated, and the atmosphere in the provincial capital is better than before. This currency should be used in the market, but various merchants still refuse to use it, using the lack of a redemption fund as an excuse. Some even deliberately close their doors and stop doing business. Although a few stores accept it, prices have skyrocketed several times, and secretly it can only be used at 60-70% of its face value, which has greatly affected the livelihood of the common people. Therefore, the authorities have successively issued announcements by the provincial government and the Martial Law Command, strictly prohibiting discounts and refusals to accept the currency, but to no avail. In order to fundamentally remedy the situation, Director Chen of the Department of Finance will use 200,000 yuan of rice import permits, the share capital of Yumin, Jianshe, and Guohuo Banks, and three months of house and shop rent as the fund for this currency. On the 3rd, he convened a meeting at the General Chamber of Commerce with directors of various industries and the financial sector to discuss maintenance measures. On the 4th, he convened a meeting with leaders of the business and financial sectors to continue the discussion. The following measures were decided: (1) All national and local collection agencies must accept the circulating currency at face value, which will be handled by the Department of Finance. (2) The Department of Finance has stated that in addition to the salt surtax, the share capital of Yumin, Jianshe, and Guohuo Banks, and three months of house and shop rent will be used as the fund. Now, the transfer of ownership of the Zhangguang and Guanghui sections of the city wall foundation is used as collateral to further increase the fund. In addition, each industry will issue notes in accordance with the Beifa loan of 800,000 yuan and deposit them with the Chamber of Commerce for joint responsibility, to be completed within three days. (3) The sealed currency is limited to 400,000 yuan. Half of the previously sealed currency will be returned. The amount that is short will be supplemented by those who have not sealed the full amount, to be completed within three days. If they do not comply, further discussion will be held. (4) The circulating currency is established to rescue finance, and the people have an obligation to assume the circulation of the currency. All transactions must not refuse to accept it. The amount of circulation, excluding the sealed amount, is limited to 400,000 yuan. (5) Change for buying goods is an unavoidable fact. Yumin and Municipal Banks should determine the price and exchange copper coins and banknotes at any time. If copper coins and banknotes are used to exchange, the circulating currency will also be used for payment in and out. (6) The circulating currency for August is allowed to purchase salt from the salt transport bureau and pay the surtax, principal, and interest. (7) The circulating currency should follow the Shanghai banknotes. The exchange settlement office should publicly discuss the exchange rate daily, but it should not be below 95% of its face value.

<h3>The Process of the Guangdong Army Recapturing Guilin</h3>
<p>The Majority of the Zhang Guijun Troops Retreat and Gather in Liuzhou and Qingyuan</p>
<p>The Eighth Route Army Dispatches Troops to Assist the Yunnan Army in Attacking Yongzhou</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The war in Guangxi Province has been stalled for a long time. Since Chen Jitang went to Wuzhou, he planned to attack Guilin to cut off the enemy's Guiliu transportation, and then attack Liuzhou with all his strength to avoid future troubles. Once the plan was set, he ordered the 59th Division of the front line, Yu Hanmou's troops, the independent brigade of Dong Renhuan's troops, and the 63rd Division of Li Yangjing's troops to each dispatch a part to attack Guilin. On the 25th, they began to move towards their destination. The independent brigade and the Huang Zhiwen brigade of Li's division advanced from Gongcheng and Yangshuo. The Ye Zhao brigade of Yu Hanmou's 59th Division departed from Lipu and met at Gaotian in Liutang. On the 29th, they had opened to Dazhongxu and Liangfengxu areas, only fifty or sixty miles away from Guilin City. At that time, the defending army was the Liang Chaoji Division of the Guilin Army. Three lines of defense were built outside Guilin City. After the Eighth Route Army completed its deployment outside the city, it dispatched five aircraft from Wuzhou to start bombing on the 30th. For two consecutive days, a total of more than 20 heavy 50-pound bombs were dropped. Enemy fortifications near Guilin were all hit and burned. On the 31st, according to aircraft reconnaissance, there were four fires inside and outside the city. The enemy's position was shaken. Therefore, the Yu's and Ye's brigade of the Eighth Route Army, which surrounded the city, ordered an attack at Chenshi on the 1st, and used heavy artillery to cover the infantry's advance. The aircraft circled in the air and dropped bombs to assist in the battle. At this time, the enemy's fortifications had been completely destroyed. After several charges by the Ye's brigade, the enemy was unable to support it and retreated from the north gate in droves. At nine o'clock, the front troops of the Ye's brigade entered the city and searched in different directions. At the same time, they posted notices to reassure the people. In the afternoon, the rear troops, the Huang Zhiwen brigade of Li's division, and the Zeng Youren and Zhang Zhiying regiments of the independent brigade successively entered the city. When attacking Guilin, the Zhang Guijun had once dispatched troops from Baolixu on the evening of the 31st to attack the rear of Yu's division in Xiuren and Lipu. Fortunately, Yu's division had made preparations early and deployed the Li Zhenqiu brigade and the Chen Hanguang regiment to defend. They fought fiercely with the attacking Guijun for two hours. The Guijun was unable to succeed and retreated to Yongfu. After Guilin was captured, the majority of Yu's and Li's divisions opened to Guilin on the 3rd. The Fan Dexing regiment also advanced to Yangshuo. They are now planning to pursue the enemy along the way and attack Liuzhou's military affairs. What the enemy's recent situation is, I think those who are concerned about the current situation also want to know. According to front-line news, Li Zongren of the Guijun is still deploying troops in Liuzhou. The Guijun troops retreating to Liuzhou and the Zhang Fakui troops total about 8,000 to 9,000. However, they are short of funds and equipment. The majority of their troops are deployed in Yongfu, Rongxian, Liuzhou, and Laibin areas. Huang Shaoxiong recently led his troops to Nanning to resist the Yunnan army attacking Yongzhou. Bai Chongxi's troops are in Rongxian. It is said that Liang Chaoji's troops retreated into Lingchuan and Quanzhou after withdrawing from Guilin, and they look like they are fleeing to the Xiang border. In addition to stationing a part of its troops in Guilin to block the enemy's retreat to Xiang, the Eighth Route Army is also rapidly advancing towards Liuzhou with the majority of its troops. At the same time, fearing that they would wipe out one and flee elsewhere, they ordered the Wu Jianhong regiment and the Zhang Jingcheng regiment in the Dahe area to open to Pingnan and Jiangkou to guard the upper reaches of the Dahe, and the newly編edited 16th Brigade of Li Deying's troops to advance to Hengxian to cut off the enemy's rear supply in Nanning, so that the Yunnan army attacking Yongzhou could enter Nanning as soon as possible.

<h3>Tragedy at Bengbu Station</h3>
<p>Crowded Passengers on the Roof</p>
<p>Nine People Hit by the Overpass and Fall</p>
<p>One Dead and Eight Injured, Very Tragic</p>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: The Jinpu Railway has recently been insufficient in military vehicles. Ordinary express trains and ordinary additional trains travel back and forth. Soldiers and poor people who do not buy tickets often sit and climb on the roof and bottom of the train, causing frequent dangers. Although the railway bureau has tried its best to prohibit it, in fact there are various difficulties, and the prohibition is ineffective, resulting in traffic delays. Yesterday (4th) at 8 pm, an ordinary express train No. 2 from Pukou had more open-air passengers without tickets on the roof than usual. Therefore, the train arrived at Bengbu Station with a delay of more than three hours. The railway staff saw that there were hundreds of soldiers and civilians sitting indiscriminately on the roof, fearing that danger would occur when the train started. They ordered the railway protection team and police officers to climb up and drive them away. The soldiers still sat firmly, and the old people who had not bought tickets also relied on the soldiers' hometown relationship as a talisman. This drove away that up, and that drove away this up, and it became more and more numerous after a long time of disturbance, even to the point where there was no room for the knee on the roof, or squatting or standing or sitting or lying, and the shapes were not the same. The railway staff saw that there was no way to drive them away, so they had to order the driver to start the train. The train started and approached the overpass after a few steps. Usually, people sitting on the roof of the car under the bridge would lie down on the top of the roof to prevent the bridge railings from colliding. This time there were too many people on the roof and there was no way to bend down. Therefore, when the car passed under the bridge, nine people on the roof were immediately hit by the iron base of the bridge and fell on both sides of the railway tracks. The station was shocked at the time, and the road police rushed forward to rescue. The bloodstains on both sides of the railway were already lying horizontally and vertically. The wife of a poor man, Wang Youde, was hit and injured, and died immediately. Wang Youde and other eight injured people were sent to the Jinpu Railway Hospital at the station by Stationmaster Wu. Today's investigation shows that Wang Youde's wife has been buried by the Public Security Bureau. Four of the injured, Wang Youde's right ear was cut off by the iron base of the overpass, and his eldest son Sanya (four years old) had his scalp cracked and sewn by a doctor. Ren Yongming's right femur was broken and his right shoulder was dislocated. Chen Yuanyi's left clavicle was broken. Wang Youde's second son Yaya and Wang Yongzhong, Zhao Daming, and Cao Shulin were slightly injured. It is heard that two soldiers have been discharged from the hospital, and the death of Wang Youde's wife and the injury of his son and the whole family are the most tragic. (August 5th)</p>

<h3>Communist Party Discovered Along the Jidun Line</h3>
<p>The Provincial Capital Implements Martial Law</p>
<p>Also, Alarm in Yanji</p>
<p>On the 2nd, Jilin Dispatch: In various parts of northeastern China bordering Russia, Russians are secretly hiding and propagating communism, causing great harm. However, thanks to the close precautions taken by our authorities, no incidents have occurred. Recently, the Chinese and Korean communists in various parts of the Northeast received secret orders from the Third International to hold an uprising on August 1st. As expected, on the morning of this day, a considerable number of communists were suddenly discovered along the Jidun railway line. Reactionary leaflets were posted everywhere. The Qigongli Bridge at Xiaogujia Station and the 109-kilometer bridge between Jiaohe and Liushuhe were all destroyed. Many electric poles and wires were also cut off, and the Jidun traffic was blocked. It is heard that there are a small number of Chinese scattered in Jiaohe, Jidun line, 150 in Jiaohe, 180 in Dunhua, and not a few on the Jihai line. The military and police immediately joined forces to suppress them and quickly dispersed them. On the one hand, the railway bureau immediately ordered the craftsmen to repair them overnight. On the 2nd, the Chenshensi was able to resume traffic as usual. According to the news from the wireless station of this city, there was also an alarm that Yanji was invaded, but the truth is not known. At the same time, Dunhua also reported that the situation was tense. Deputy Commander Zuo Xiang intended to send the Feng Shoushan department of the 34th Regiment stationed in the province to assist in the suppression. However, the defense of the province is also very important, and the division of troops is afraid that the force is weak. After inquiring by telegram to the leader of the Wang Regiment stationed in Dunhua, Zhao Nan, how many communists there are and whether it is necessary to increase the force, it was learned that there are about 500 bandits, most of whom have no firearms. The regiment's force is enough to suppress them, so it is temporarily not deployed. The Public Security Bureau of the Provincial Capital had previously received reports that there would be a bandit riot on August 1st. In order to prevent trouble before it happens, it secretly ordered the police teams to strictly guard against it. Yesterday, the security team divided into teams and patrolled the city, inside and outside, and in the commercial port. The police in each district increased their guard invisibly. Yesterday morning, slogans such as "Down with Imperialism" were found in public places in the provincial capital, and the police tore them down. There was no peace. On the 3rd, Jilin Dispatch: The situation of the communist party cutting off the Jidun line and the martial law in Yanji and the provincial capital has been reported in detail. Now it is known that although the Jidun bridge has been repaired, the communist party has not been completely eliminated. There are bombs buried by the communist party near the Huangnihe River, and the road is not dared to take risks lightly. Only one train was opened on the 2nd. Suddenly a large gang of communist parties broke out near Huanghuasongdian, and the local protection regiments and Ding were mostly disarmed. Also, when the road maintenance workers of the Dao Fang near the Ehemou station inspected the route on the 2nd, three Koreans suddenly jumped out from under the bridge, and their actions were suspicious. They were immediately arrested and handed over to the road police to be escorted to the province for interrogation. The search is still in progress. The Public Security Bureau of the Provincial Capital convened a meeting to maintain law and order yesterday because of the communist leaflets and slogans recently found in the provincial capital. It distributed plainclothes military and police to check the hotels, brothels, and all public entertainment places, and especially interrogated pedestrians at night. It also dispatched armed security teams to patrol the market in shifts and share the police with the provincial defense forces. Therefore, although there are various rumors, no accidents have occurred. However, in Bonizi, Qiqu District, Yongji County, which is 50 or 60 miles away from the province, more than 200 communists suddenly rioted on the morning of the 2nd. However, they had no weapons. The head of the public security sub-bureau of the district telegraphed to the headquarters and forwarded it to the county government for emergency help. County magistrate Wang reported to Chairman Zhang, requesting that capable officers and soldiers be sent to block the attack. It is expected that it can be extinguished. It is heard that the Provincial Public Security Bureau had previously received a confidential report from the anti-communist party that the Soviet Third International ordered the Korean and Chinese communists in the Eastern Province to cooperate and use the three eastern provinces as a disturbed area. Therefore, the communist disturbances this time were a planned action. Now, Shenyang has already issued a strict prohibition.</p>
<h3>Report of the Ethnological Group on the Investigation of the Hezhen People</h3>
<p>The Hezhen people in Northeast China are scattered in the Jiangyan counties under the jurisdiction of the old Yilan Road in Jilin Province, commonly known as the Hezhen people or the Heijin people, also known as the Fish Skin Tartars. Now they are commonly called the Laodazi, and the Western name is Goryte. This ethnic group is divided into the Songhua River and the Ussuri River factions. The Songhua River faction was编organized into four banners in the eighth year of Guangxu in the former Qing Dynasty. A commander was set up in Gadangtun, four miles away from Fujin County, to rule it. The Ussuri River faction was not 编organized into a banner, so it is also called the Waishan people. The scope of this investigation by the Northeast Tungus ethnic group investigation team of the Institute of Ethnology of the Academia Sinica is limited to the Songhua River faction, from Menggolili in Huachuan County to Qindereli in Fuyuan County (that is, renamed Suiyuan). Within this faction, it can be divided into two parts due to different languages: the He tribe from Menggolili to Futing, and the Qiling tribe from Gadangtun to Qindereli. The former mainly lives by hunting, and the latter mainly lives by fishing. As for the research methods, the team members Ling et al. gathered eight people from the ethnic group who had received primary school education and those who had not received education but were more intelligent after arriving in the lower reaches of the Songhua River, and trained them to assist in the work. The research work is divided into five parts: culture, language, anthropometry, photography, and collection of specimens. In terms of material culture, the methods of fishing and hunting and various machines and tools, as well as various methods of leather making, birch bark utensils, housing equipment, clothing decoration, food and drink, and smoking and drinking hobbies are studied in detail. In terms of spiritual culture, the marriage and funeral rituals, justice, politics and education, songs, dances, myths, stories, and art of the Hezhen are studied, and the shaman religion, which is characteristic of the ethnic group, is especially fully studied. The languages of the Hezhen and Qiling tribes are compared, and the outline of their grammar is obtained. Measurements of men and women are carried out to obtain the results. The Hezhen are of mixed blood of many people, and the Qiling tribe can be compared to the pure race of the Tungus. More than 300 photos were taken, and more than 600 specimens were collected. The local names were recorded in detail, and their uses were carefully studied. The daily necessities, religious gods, art works, and other items of the ethnic group were roughly collected, and they were packed into ten large boxes and transported back to the institute together with the four boxes of stone tools specimens of the ethnic group of the Stone Age discovered in Yilan for research.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, the Hezhen people had more than 400 households, estimating their population at about 3,000. Over the past 300 years, the population has not only not increased, but has gradually decreased. Now there are only more than 500 people left. The reasons are: (1) The ethnic group lives by fishing and hunting and does not know how to farm. Recently, Han Chinese have moved to this land to reclaim wasteland and cut down forests. Their enclosure is shrinking day by day, and the antlers and animal skins obtained from each hunting are almost not enough to supply their lives. (2) Men and women, young and old, aged 17 and above, all like to drink burning wine and smoke opium, which harms their bodies. Therefore, all income and expenditure are mostly wasted on tobacco and alcohol, and life is even more difficult. (3) When there are diseases, they only know how to dance the gods and do not believe in medicine. When plagues are prevalent, entire families die. (4) Women with a little beauty are willing to marry Han Chinese. Statistics show that there are more men than women. (5) Women often suffer from malnutrition and tuberculosis, and it is not easy to give birth. (6) The infant mortality rate accounts for 80% to 90% or more. The above are just a few of the major reasons, and opium smoking is the most important reason. Opium can destroy the country and exterminate the race. The Hezhen people can be a lesson for the Chinese people. The Hezhen, who were once called the Tungus heroic tribe, may disappear from the banks of the Songhua River in a few decades.</p>
<p>In addition to investigating the ethnic group, Ling is also concerned about the issue of transplantation. He carefully studied the soil, rainfall, and climate along the Songhua River in the lower reaches of the Songhua River, and found that it is suitable for planting rice and transplanting Southerners. Now, the rice business is monopolized by Koreans, but the planting methods are improper and rely solely on the thickness of the land without turning the soil. There will be no great hope in the future. If you want rice to develop in the future, you must vigorously encourage Southerners to transplant, but Southerners' transplant to the Northeast has repeatedly failed, such as Hunan people in Yilan and Hubei people in Dalai. Recently, Zhejiang people in Taonan, Southerners' transplant cannot be as easy as Zhili, Henan, and Lu people. People from these three provinces have a history of transplanting outside the customs for three or four hundred years. There are many relatives, friends, and fellow villagers who know each other, so it is easy to settle here. Southerners do not have this advantage, and those who handle the transplant are rashly engaged in it on a whim. There is no full preparation before the event, the immigrants are not adequately trained, and the transplant organization lacks a close organization, and those who are in charge of it do not have the professional knowledge of transplantation, so the result is a waste of money and manpower, and little success is achieved.</p>
<p>Ling et al. left Harbin on the 22nd of last month to contact Heilongjiang for the next survey of the Solun and Oroqen people.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Quick News</h3>
<p>The commander of the Wuhu Garrison Regiment, Feng, led two companies of soldiers to Nanling the day before yesterday to join the police teams of Nanling, Wuhu, and Xuancheng counties to encircle and suppress the bandits who looted Huangmu Ferry. Several people have been arrested. Now the bandits have escaped from Fanchang Wuhuashan and fled to other places. The garrison regiment has been stationed near Wuhuashan to pursue them. The police teams of the counties south of Wuhu have all been recalled due to the importance of security in the county.</p>
<p>The various circles were alarmed by the hoarding and speculation of rice merchants, which caused a panic in food supply. This afternoon, they held a joint meeting at the Municipal Party Department and decided to request the Pingtiao Committee to earnestly maintain and stipulate the minimum rice price of 6.5 sheng per yuan for foreign rice and 7 sheng for domestic rice. If hoarding is found again in the future, they will be severely punished. Also, the market price of copper coins has risen sharply in the past two days, from more than 310 coins to 280 coins, which has greatly affected the livelihood of the people. It was decided to request the Public Security Bureau to ban the export of copper coins and request the General Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the money merchants to restore the original price in order to maintain social tranquility.</p>
<p>All the electric lights in Wuhu Henan suddenly went out last night. Liu Junqing, the compradore of the Xijie Zhishong foreign firm, and his wife and another old woman were all electrocuted and fainted. Liu's wife died immediately, and Liu and the old woman were also in danger. The Public Security Bureau specially sent a security team to the south bank to deploy defenses to maintain it. The reason is said to be due to the sudden interruption of the power line between the north and south banks of the river.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Jiang telegraphed to the Anhui Provincial Government, stating that the atmosphere of tobacco seedlings and bandits in northern Anhui is everywhere. It is inappropriate for the Provincial Government to fail to eradicate them. The General Headquarters specially ordered the Anhui Provincial Bandit Suppression Headquarters to organize a clean-up campaign. However, the Provincial Government issued a notice to various counties stating that anyone who collects land and tobacco seedling donations for Yuan Liyi will be dismissed and punished, which hinders the clean-up campaign. The Provincial Government is hereby ordered to forward the order to the various county governments to abide by the order of Bandit Suppression Commander Wei Lihuang and assist in handling it without the slightest neglect.

<h3>Luo Buzhou's Suspicion of Collusion with the Enemy Case is Sent Back for Retrial</h3>
<p>Luo Buzhou, a compradore of the Nanjing Heping Foreign Firm, was reported to the Commander-in-Chief's Political Training Department in November of the 16th year of the Republic of China by more than 380 employees of the firm's foreign branch, stating that Luo had provided the warlord Sun Chuanfang with 200,000 yuan in military pay and Zhang Zongchang with 120,000 yuan in foreign currency, which was suspected of colluding with the enemy. The case was transferred to the Special Court for trial, and then transferred to the Jiangsu High Court for handling in accordance with the law. The original plaintiff's witness was interrogated by the former Judge Ye, and the trial was concluded in September of last year, sentencing Luo Buzhou to five years of imprisonment for the crime of suspicion of collusion with the enemy. Luo stated that he was not satisfied and extended lawyers Li Shirui and Wu Chengyu to appeal to the Supreme Court. Luo Buzhou also provided 10,000 yuan in cash and found Sun Hengji and Yan Xinmao, two porcelain shops in Suzhou, to post bail and await the verdict. The Supreme Court has now ruled that the case be sent back to the High Court for retrial. The High Court is scheduled to hear the case on the morning of yesterday (8th).

The witnesses all testified that they only had dinner that day and there were two tables of mahjong, but they did not know anything else. Then lawyers Li Shirui and Wu Chengyu defended him. Judge Zheng ordered that the hearing be adjourned to another date because the plaintiffs did not arrive.</p>

<h3>Two Cases That Have Been Detained But Not Yet Judged</h3>
<p>Wang Jun, a resident of Zhangcun in this county, was arrested and sent to the county for interrogation for having communist activities, but he has not yet been decided. Last month, Wang Zhangguo's wife appealed to the provincial government because her husband was wrongly detained. Chairman Ye ordered County Magistrate Sun of this county to investigate and handle the case in accordance with the law. Recently, Wang Zhangguo's wife continued to appeal to the provincial government, requesting that the county government be strictly ordered to comply with the previous order. After receiving the appeal, Chairman Ye approved the waiting for another order to handle the case together with the county. Also, after Sun Junxiu, the propaganda director of the county party department of this county, was arrested for the case, the High Court declared him innocent of the counter-revolutionary part. However, the High Court sent the part about the talk case back to the original county for trial, but it has not yet been judged. Last week, Sun Zizhengan appealed to the provincial government to call for a transcript of the case on the grounds of framing good people. After receiving the appeal, the provincial government ordered the Department of Civil Affairs to send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation, and then wait for further verification.

<p>The lake bandits from Haizhou and Henan gangs, notorious for robbing ships and kidnapping for ransom in the Su-area Hengjing Wangye area, are now facing internal strife. Due to conflicting interests, the two gangs have engaged in mutual fighting. The Henan gang, realizing their inability to maintain a foothold, has dispersed and fled. The Haizhou gang, recognizing their isolation and weakness, has also dispersed and released eighteen hostages in front of the Hengshan Temple. Seven or eight other hostages have been taken elsewhere for ransom negotiations. The 7th Squad of the 2nd Water Police District patrolled the Hengjing Lake area on the evening of the 7th, encountering two bandit ships. They immediately gave chase to the Zhangzui Bridge area, where four bandits disembarked and attempted to flee ashore. The water police opened fire, killing two, while the others escaped.

<p>The Wuxi County Government had allocated 20,000 yuan of overdue Caocao (Grain Transport) fines to the county's 1930 budget for civil administration, education, construction, agriculture, and commerce. However, a recent order from the provincial government required the funds to be remitted to the province. County Magistrate Sun, citing the county's dire financial situation, with an outstanding deficit of over 70,000 yuan from 1929 that remained unaddressed, and the already heavily reduced 1930 budget, argued that further reductions were impossible. Remitting the overdue fines would lead to a local financial collapse. The matter was brought before the county administration conference, and it was resolved to present the difficulties to the province for review. The petition was submitted to the provincial government yesterday.</p>

<h3>Twists and Turns in the Trafficking Case</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau of the county previously investigated and found Wang Buhai, a trafficker, and the girl abducted from Fanchuan at the Bo'ai Hospital on Zuowei Street in the city. After the suspect was proven and bailed out, a Mr. Wang discovered that the girl had other relationships with the Bo'ai Hospital. Yesterday evening (6th), he went to the hospital to make a big noise, causing a conflict with Zhang Liran's younger brother, Zu, the director of the hospital. Both sides were taken to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau. After a lawyer intervened, they were temporarily released on bail.

Yao himself works in Shanghai. His wife, being timid, dared not speak out and followed the instructions. The next morning, the plaster on the wall had disappeared. A few days later, another letter arrived, lowering the price by five yuan and instructing him to do the same. The matter was known to Yao Zhibi's elder brother, Zhixi, who strongly dissuaded his sister-in-law from complying and planned to report it to the police district. His sister-in-law, fearing resentment, secretly prepared five yuan and did as instructed. This is truly a strange phenomenon of increasingly bizarre extortion.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Revises Service Regulations for Principals of Experimental Elementary Schools in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education instructed the Jiangsu Education Department to revise the service regulations for principals of experimental elementary schools in Jiangsu Province. The order stated that the submitted documents have been reviewed (the service regulations for principals of provincial secondary schools are satisfactory). The general direction is approved and recorded. However, certain provisions in the service regulations for principals of provincial experimental elementary schools and secondary schools are cumbersome. Provisions 1, 2, and 3 are particularly difficult to implement in practice. Since principals are responsible for all duties in their schools and also hold positions in the secondary school normal course, how can they find time to travel to each county for an inspection every year? Therefore, the following revisions should be made: (1) Each year, use holidays or other times to convene a local education bureau chief or inspector, and elementary school representatives from each county to conduct an education research meeting. Discuss the actual problems of elementary schools, report on the experimental results of the school, and guide elementary schools in each county to improve and progress. Submit the minutes and resolutions of the meeting to the Education Department for verification. (2) When necessary, visit each region and county to inspect local education, report experimental results, and give educational speeches to guide elementary schools in each county to improve and progress. Submit the inspection results to the Education Department for verification. Provisions 4 and 5 are changed to Provisions 3 and 4. Provision 6 is deleted. You are required to comply with the revisions and resubmit the revised regulations to the Ministry for verification.</p>

<p>Seventeen Groups Sent Off Students Going Abroad Yesterday</p>
<h3>Sponsoring Groups</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5 pm, seventeen groups, including the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, the World Chinese Students' Federation, National Jiaotong University, National Tongji University, National Jinan University, Fudan University, Qixiu Girls' School, Shanghai Law College, Shen Bao Newspaper, Xinwen Bao Newspaper, Shishi Xinbao Newspaper, Minguo Ribao Newspaper, China Review Weekly, China Science Society, Overseas Chinese Association, Commercial Press, and Zhonghua Book Company, held a meeting at the Dahua Hotel on Gordon Road to send off students going to Europe and the United States at public and private expense.</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>The attendees included students going abroad: Liu Wufei, Gao Aihong, Gao Shangying, Zhang Qitai, Qu Duan, Chen Yibai, Zhang Bingsun, Wang Jiuling, Su Shifan, Tan Kunying, Zheng Zaoxiu, Xu Quanchang, Mao Fengyi, Li Liezhi, He Zhidong, Wang Guosong, Wang Jing, Lin Jianying, Xiong Zhicang, Chen Baoshu, Cheng Wanfu, Wang Tingrui, Ma Yunpeng, Xing Chuandong, Xu Yinqi, Deng Juesheng, Lai Hongbin, Li Desheng, Yin Baoyu, Miao Zhongyi, Miao Zhongyan, Wang Jianxian, Wu Shilin, Yang Yage, Chen Sicheng, You Jiazhang, Wu Lianjie, Sun Jiaqian, Jin Shanbao, Lu Shougeng, Su Xing, Su Zhuangnian, Fan Zhiyuan, Zhao Tingbing, guests Hu Cuishi, Li Qianruo, Zhu Baofen, Tan Boyu, Yu Nanqiu, He Bingsong, He Dongchu, Xiong Wenmin, Yang Minghui, Wu Binghai, Huang Jingwan, Wang Renlin, Qiu Kefu, Xu Wanshan, Chen Zhaoyue, Tang Rongshang, Ding Huaifen, Sun Jie, Ren Fengai, Huang Bingji, Zhou Xiaqian, Zhou Wenqin, Zhou Wenyan, Wu Zhijian, Hu Zuyin, Yuan Yeyu, Xu Xingchu, Smith, Xu Lun, Anlide, Xilong, Zheng Peiyi, Zheng Peiya, Gu Guoliang, Ye Xinyuan, Kang Xuanyi, Liu Houkun, Sun Cuicun, Ge Gongzhen, Ma Chonggan, Lang Jingshan, Gu Zhizhong, Zhang Boyin, Chen Xianmo, Jiang Huaiqing, Zhu Hongjie, Lu Xuehuan, Hua Chengying, Wu Xiexun, Wu Deyin, Zhu Shaoping, Chen Dezheng, and more than 300 others.</p>
<h3>Meeting Proceedings</h3>
<p>After a group photo was taken, the attendees filed into the venue. The meeting was presided over by Zhu Shaoping, the Secretary-General of the World Chinese Students' Federation. Chen Dezheng, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, served as chairman and began with formal salutations. Chairman Chen then delivered a farewell speech, stating that the hope of the seventeen groups in Shanghai for everyone was even stronger than in the past, because the economic burden of going abroad for students was not as heavy as it is today. Since the price of gold has risen, the economic burden on both publicly funded and privately funded students has approximately doubled. Therefore, everyone's responsibilities have increased, and the hopes of the various groups for everyone have also become greater. Our country sends hundreds of students abroad every year, and quite a few return home. But society does not appear to be affected at all. Is the country and society not using talent? Or are the people unwilling or unable to contribute to the country and society? This is the question. In the past, graduates of higher primary schools and secondary school students also went abroad to study, which was too uneconomical. Now that this trend has been reduced, the government should establish large-scale academic research institutions to provide specialized research for those in the country who have received higher education, and it is not necessary to take so much money abroad to study. But the current situation does not allow you to travel far away at this expensive time, and your ambition is commendable. I sincerely hope that this time you go abroad, you can use this perseverance and spirit to extract the essence of that country to build a new China in the future. After that, Mr. Anlide, the Commercial Counselor of the American Embassy, spoke, stating that Mr. Zhu Shaoping of the Global Chinese Students' Federation has given the attention that you need to pay to everything when going to the United States. I do not want to say more. Now I would like to ask you to pay attention to two things: First, after arriving in the United States, you must communicate with Americans from time to time. Do not be lonely and self-reliant. Second, if you are not familiar with the route or have difficulties, you must ask more people to avoid suffering yourself. After Mr. An's speech, Mr. Biren Xijiu gave a speech, stating that Chinese culture occupies an extremely important position in the world. I sincerely hope that after arriving in Europe, you will not only work hard in your studies but also pay attention to the characteristics of Western culture in order to promote China's inherent culture. After the speech, Mr. Tan Boyu, the representative of Tongji University, gave a speech, saying that all the points of hope that we people have for you have been said by Chairman Chen one by one. I do not want to discuss more. I want to contribute to you now, that is, when you go abroad to study, you must be determined to study a certain subject. Those who study engineering must learn the smaller scale industries that are suitable for China's economic environment. Determination has its own experience, and learning small-scale industries is more suitable for the current situation in China. These two points are what I hope you will pay attention to. After Mr. Tan finished speaking,</p>

<h3>Pre-announcement of the White Goose Painting Society Exhibition</h3>
<p>The White Goose Painting Society was founded in the spring of the 17th year of the Republic by famous painters Fang Xuejiu, Pan Sitong, Dou Xueou, and Chen Qiucao. It has been reorganized several times. Although the group has not had significant public exposure, it has been working very hard internally. Because they did not want to indiscriminately gather members and ruin the original spirit, Chen, Fang, Pan, and Dou contributed funds to create the White Goose Painting Research Institute, sacrificing their time and energy to focus on cultivating real talent and promoting the true spirit of art research. After a year, many talents have emerged. In order to complete unification, the society has actively collected and selected members such as Feng Qiuhen and Zhou Xi to prepare for the first painting exhibition in Shanghai. At the same time, they are expressing their initial intention to engage in pure artistic movements. It is said that the exhibition date will be in the cool autumn month of September, and all arrangements will be carefully designed. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>New Information from the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center has recently paid special attention to guidance for further education during employment guidance and psychological testing. The publication of special issues is quite relevant to the needs of young people seeking further education in various places. Recently, in response to requests from young people in various places, it is investigating the entrance examination questions of various universities and middle schools and publishing them in the "Further Education Guide" to help young people prepare for the examinations. To serve young people in terms of guidance, service, and self-cultivation, it has published "Vocational Guidance Lectures," priced at 12 cents per booklet, available at the center and the Civilization Bookstore. In order to meet the needs of all sectors of society, it has consulted with the China Vocational Education Society to establish specialized courses in clerical work, phonetic symbols, and worker education teacher training in a trial basis to create specialized talents for social application. Recent statistics show that an average of 40 people come to the center for consultations daily, an average of 20 people register, an average of 10 people seek further education, and about four or five people entrust the center with their cases. However, only about one-tenth of the introductions are successful. Yesterday, Jilin University sent a telegram requesting the introduction of a professor of law and politics. The center immediately introduced Dr. Wei Liangsheng. A middle school in this city entrusted the center to hire a registrar who must be proficient in English and Chinese, diligent, and capable, with a monthly salary of 40 yuan. Those who wish to apply must first send their Chinese and English works and handwriting samples to the center. A girls' middle school in Anhui Province entrusted the center to introduce a female teacher of embroidery and sewing and a female teacher of knitting socks, towels, and undershirts, both with rich experience and over 25 years of age, with a monthly salary of 60 yuan each.</p>

<h3>Nanhua Football Team</h3>
<p>Wins 4-1 Against Selangor Team</p>
<p>Relief for Unemployed Workers</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Audience Sponsors</p>
<p>(July 28, Kuala Lumpur Dispatch) The Nanhua Football Team is scheduled to play a charity match against the Selangor United Team at 5:00 PM on July 28th at Ambon Road, Kuala Lumpur, to use the proceeds from ticket sales to provide relief to unemployed Chinese workers in Selangor. Locals are enthusiastically purchasing tickets to attend the match for this charitable cause. There were more than 6,000 people. When the athletes from both sides arrived at the stadium, the applause from the audience resounded throughout the clouds. One minute after the start of the game, the Nanhua team was penalized for a foul, but the Selangor team's shot was inaccurate and was lightly saved by Bao Tiemen. After 15 minutes, Nanhua's Feng Jingxiang drove straight in and shot, immediately opening the scoring. After that, the battle between the two sides was extremely fierce, but there were no gains or losses until five minutes before the end of the game when Nanhua's Zhu Guolun kicked in a goal, making it 2-0. After changing sides, the Selangor team bravely attacked and scored a goal first. After ten minutes, Nanhua repeatedly attacked the enemy's goal, winning two goals and making it 4-1. Nanhua won. After that, although the Selangor team tried hard to counterattack, the enemy's military strength was strong and there was no chance to take advantage of it, so it was useless to sigh. At the end of the game, the audience applauded again, as if celebrating Nanhua's success.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Seafarer</p>
<p>A: Why did you open three holes in the wall?</p>
<p>B: So that our three kittens can go in and out.</p>
<p>A: Then one hole is enough.</p>
<p>B: Where did that come from? If there was one cat, of course, one hole would be opened. Now there are three cats, so there must be three holes.</p>
<p>A: My grandfather is ninety-five years old this year.</p>

<p>B: Then I'll have to dig up the ancestral grave.</p>
<p>A: Life is like a train running on tracks. If it derails, there is danger.</p>
<p>B: What analogy do you have for a husband and wife?</p>
<p>A: For example, two train cars are connected and moving forward.</p>

<h3>A Short Stay at Mogan Mountain (6)</h3>
<p>— Jingbo</p>
<p>Since the Zhejiang Provincial Government organized the Mogan Mountain Management Bureau, many municipal constructions have been carried out in the mountains. Electric lights and telephones have been installed one after another. The mountain roads operated by foreigners have been unconditionally handed over to Chinese management after serious negotiations. Although the foreigners' summer resort can continue to exist, its influence has declined and it is unable to interfere in mountain administrative affairs. In the past, foreigners mostly privately transferred property in the mountains, and the contracts were not perfect. After the establishment of the Management Bureau, it was stipulated that foreigners should not own property in the mountains. If foreigners want to sell real estate, they can only sell it to Chinese people. Therefore, in the past one or two years, Chinese villas have been increasing day by day. Generally, the foreigners' residences are in extremely good locations, and when they are sold, the room's utensils and appliances are given as gifts. Recently, people have been buying houses from foreigners from time to time. It is expected that in less than ten years, there will be no foreign residences in the mountains, and Mogan Mountain will become a perfect summer resort for Chinese people.</p>
<p>The railway hotel's catering methods are the same as those on sea ships. In addition to the three meals, tea and snacks are provided to guests in the early morning and afternoon. Meals are also served at fixed times. However, it is impossible to have snacks outside of these times, because it is not easy to buy food in the mountains. If you want to share a meal with guests at the hotel, you must inform them in advance, otherwise there will be no way to respond at the last minute. I think that in the future, more people climbing the mountain will bring canned food for occasional needs. I stayed in the mountains for a few days and occasionally saw something, so I wrote it down in a jumble, and I didn't feel that the words were wasteful. (End)</p>
<h3>A Record of the Filial Son of Kong's Tomb</h3>
<p>— Wang Meiju</p>
<p>Yesterday, after getting drunk at the home of my friend Wu Liuyi, I returned to Seymour Road. Because it was not far away, I walked under the cloudy sun. When I reached the corner of Xinza Road, I suddenly heard someone calling from behind. When I looked back, an old man in a rickshaw bowed to me and said, "Are you not Wang Shuchen?" (My old name was Shuchen, and few Shanghai friends know it.) "Do you remember Xu Zigu, a friend from Suzhou in those years?" I also said, "I haven't seen you for forty years, no wonder I don't recognize you when we meet." So I invited him to sit down at Baimeting Pavilion. We talked about what had happened since we parted and asked about each other's recent situation. Zigu said, "I don't know where to start with a Twenty-Four Histories. But now that I have met you, you are good at ancient prose, so you should write a biography for the Filial Son of Kong's Tomb." I didn't know what to say, so Zigu solemnly narrated it. The filial son's surname is Cheng, and he is a fisherman from Kuatang Bridge, Suzhou. He lost his parents when he was young and lived with his aunt, Ms. Zhang. When he was young, although he had entered a village school, he was fond of playing and knew few words. His aunt was a fisherman, so Cheng followed her to play with nets. Later, he married a woman named Hong, and his aunt died without an heir. Cheng and his wife observed mourning for her like a filial son. Whenever they got fish, they must present it in three cases in front of the thatched cottage, saying, "To sacrifice to my parents, aunt, and teacher Confucius." People laughed at him for being unethical. Hong also said, "Why does a fisherman worship Confucius?" Cheng didn't listen and did it every day without getting tired. Ten days ago, after setting up a sacrifice, he went in to sell fish. At noon, he cried and returned home, holding a piece of cloth and ordering Hong to cut it into a waist belt. He and his wife and two children put on mourning clothes on the boat. His wife was at a loss, and the neighboring boats also changed their color to explore. Hong said, "My family has no great merit from either the husband's or the mother's family. I don't know what he is doing today." Cheng cried bitterly and didn't hear his wife's answers to people. After a long time, many people persuaded him to stop and asked him who was dead. Cheng beat his chest and cried to the sky, "The great sage of China for thousands of years will now destroy his tomb! How can I not cry?" Everyone seemed to understand or not, and some suspected that he had some kind of stimulus or neurological disorder. However, from that day on, he cried morning and evening until Zigu left Suzhou last night. He had not stopped for seven days. Meiju said, "This is better than Duo Duo, the filial son of Xuanling in the Han Dynasty." Zigu also said, "Recently, I heard that a woman wrote to the National Government to remove the ancient books so that only the Three Principles of the People would exist in the world. However, the fisherman is destroying Confucius' tomb as if he had lost his parents. Why do they each go to extremes?" I can't name the mystery. I have briefly recorded the ins and outs of this matter and call him the Filial Son of Kong's Tomb.</p>
<h3>The Naming of Lu Gaojian</h3>
<p>— Qiulang</p>
<p>The meat shops at sea compete to hang the "True Lu Gaojian" brand. At first, I didn't know what it meant. Recently, while chatting with a friend, I asked him about it. My friend said, "According to legend, there was a man from Suzhou named Lu who set up a meat shop in the market. Although he worked in the slaughter industry, he was naturally kind and often gave to the poor. One day, a beggar came to the shop, emaciated and ragged. Lu gave him money, but he didn't accept it. He wanted a corner of the house to shelter him from the wind and rain. Lu took pity on him and agreed, giving him a straw mat to use as a bed and giving him food every day without being stingy. After living there for more than a month, the beggar's illness had healed. He bid farewell to Lu, saying, "I am grateful for your kindness, but I have no way to repay you. Please use this straw mat as fuel to cook meat to show my heart." Lu did as he said. Suddenly, the meat in the pot emitted a strange fragrance that spread far and wide. People came to buy it, and his life became prosperous. Therefore, the meat shop brands all used this good name.</p>
<h3>Can Fish Hear?</h3>
<p>— Qiushui</p>
<p>The question of whether fish have hearing organs and can hear human speech and movements has long been the center of discussion for ichthyologists. There have always been two theories. Anglers, for example, is famous for advocating that fish have hearing organs. However, general zoologists say that although fish have ears, they cannot use them, severely criticizing the absurdity of his theory. The two sides have been arguing until now. Can fish hear? It is indeed a very interesting question, so I will list the latest theories on the left.</p>
<p>Listening to Music to Discriminate Food Recently, a scientist named Herr HStertte at the University of Maulik in Germany wrote an article published in major newspapers in Berlin to support Anglers, saying that fish can hear the sound of music. The basis for this is his years of field experiments. He said that he had kept various kinds of fish at home. When feeding them, he must mix them with music or various human voices every day. After a long time, when the sound wave was made, even without food, the fish's hearing was very sensitive. He first used a certain sound to represent a kind of high-quality food and then used another sound to represent a kind of inferior, inedible thing. After training on time for a long time, when the fish heard a certain sound, they gathered together. When they heard other sounds, they were indifferent and did not move. Therefore, the fish not only have hearing organs and can listen to music, but also their hearing is sensitive and they can also listen to the sound and discriminate food.</p>
<p>Fish Have No Ears However, those who hold the opposing view are actually numerous. A zoology expert in London once told a newspaper reporter, "I have done various experiments with animals in the zoo, and I do not believe that fish can hear as Mr. Stette said. If you hide yourself beside the fish tank and clap your hands to make a sound, the fish will swim in the tank as usual without moving. However, if you stand facing the water and clap your hands again, the fish will gather together and float on the surface of the water to ask you for food. Therefore, I believe that fish have sensitive vision and touch, but there is definitely no such thing as hearing."</p>
<p>Fish Can Distinguish Colors Although there are still doubts about whether fish have hearing organs and can listen to and distinguish sounds, the fish's vision is extremely sharp and has already become a recognized fact. Try to use a red plate to serve high-quality food to feed them, and at the same time use a blue plate to serve inferior food to give them. After a long time, when the fish see the red plate coming, they gather together and scramble for food. They are indifferent to the blue plate and do not move. Alas, fish are also spiritual things!</p>
<h3>Barefoot Movement</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>In this scorching summer, compelled by social obligations, one cannot avoid making visits. As a member of the "long gown" faction, it is impossible not to wear silk socks and satin shoes. During this time, I feel a sense of suffering because, since falling ill, I have been confined to my home, spending the summers barefoot for the past three years. This year, starting from the old Dragon Boat Festival, I have been bareheaded and barefoot for two months. Once I have to wear the long gown and socks, I feel like I am in shackles, as hot as being burned, and all kinds of discomfort affect my whole body. It is not until this moment that I realize the joy of being barefoot. Thinking back to the thirty years of bustling about in famous places, falsely claiming to play a role, running around in officialdom with hand plaques and boots, suddenly all eight feet are suspended in the air, and the roasting feet are unbearable. In short, the right to be barefoot has been sacrificed for a long time, and I deeply regret and cherish this motive for my "Foolish Barefoot Movement". I plan to designate the period from the beginning of summer to the beginning of autumn as the barefoot period every year, regardless of who it is, everyone will be barefoot, but other clothing will remain the same, whether wearing a long gown or a suit and formal dress, but with bare feet, wouldn't it be unsightly? The response should be that it will be normal once people get used to it. What is so unsightly? Hands are solid proof that wearing a long gown or suit without gloves and with bare hands is not unsightly. Bare feet are even more acceptable as long as people get used to seeing them. This movement, I also plan to expand from bare feet to bare chests, and from bare chests to being naked. The civilization faction often criticizes being bare-chested as barbaric, but the foreigners use sunbathing as treatment, so it becomes civilized. Being naked has theories such as the "model of truth, goodness, and beauty" as its basis. Considering that the timing is not yet ripe for the latter two aspects, I will postpone them for now and start with being barefoot, which has three benefits. First, bare hands and bare feet ensure equality between hands and feet, preventing discord and laying the foundation for overall freedom. Second, it is convenient. Washing feet is much easier than wearing socks, and the sweat and odor are greatly reduced, which is beneficial to hygiene. Third, it is free. The money saved from buying socks during this movement period averages one yuan per person, which amounts to 40,000 yuan, a significant economic benefit. Fellow countrymen, why not join us? After drafting this article, I saw a newspaper report that Marilyn, a female star from Hollywood, is advocating a "no socks" movement and practicing being barefoot, which is indeed the same as my own idea. However, in China, I am still a pioneer in being barefoot.</p>
<p>News from the Art World: Mr. Huang Zhuan Tao, a novelist from Wumen, is skilled in painting. He previously collaborated with Mr. Yu Yifen on fan pages, which were frequently requested.

For local customers, items will be collected in three days; for customers outside of the city, items will be mailed in two days. The collection address is Xin Shanghai Tongxun She, No. 18, Block B, Baker Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Eastern Travel Impressions (27)</h3>
<p>— Qian Hua</p>
<p>During the elevator ride, the driver does not rest for a moment, speaking with utmost politeness and humility. Therefore, "dōmo" is continuously used fluently and pleasantly ("dōmo" is the most polite ending in Japanese). At each elevator entrance, the greeters bow to ninety degrees when opening and closing the elevator's iron gate to show welcome and farewell, while telling guests the classification and advantages of the goods displayed on the floor, echoing the driver in perfect harmony. These women have undergone considerable training by the company, first taught mechanical knowledge and then taught response phrases, so that they can use them skillfully once put into practice. A joker said that the driver is like a nightingale, and the elevator is a birdcage, with the clear sound of the nightingale reaching the ears, fulfilling the passengers' shallow desires. The ages of the drivers and greeters at Matsuzakaya are younger, from eleven or twelve to fourteen or fifteen, which makes them seem even more lively and cute. In addition to elevators, department stores also have escalators, which allow customers to reach the third, fourth, and fifth floors without lifting a foot, and there is no limit to the number of people. One can easily ascend the steps and ascend quickly, which is more convenient than elevators. There are also customer lounges and rooftop gardens, arranged in an elegant and serene manner. The lounges offer tea and cigarettes to guests, and the women are attentive in their hospitality. One does not need to make a purchase to be entitled to this. The rooftop garden is filled with flowers and trees, and contains exotic goldfish. Looking down from a high vantage point, the entire city of Tokyo is clearly visible. Whenever the sun sets in the west, the visitors seem to weave together. There is a dining room in the garden that sells all kinds of food at affordable prices, and it is often crowded. There are also several young girls hired next to the main entrance of the Matsuzaka star, who specialize in welcoming and sending off customers. Mitsukoshi employs young children to do this, constantly holding perfume bottles and spraying them on customers to show respect. As for the internal layout, every effort is made to attract customers' attention, such as Mitsukoshi's Far East Games special room, which displays photos, medals, and records of previous games, as well as prizes from all walks of life in this session, such as Chiang Kai-shek's silver pagoda and this newspaper's silver shield, all arranged in a dazzling array. Other events, such as Matsuzakaya's cosmetics conference and Marubishi's hot spring exhibition, are also sufficient to increase public knowledge and arouse keen interest. What makes us feel infinite emotion is that nineteen of the goods sold in department stores are made in Japan, and only one or two are imported, and are only used as decorations. Their prices are incredibly high, while our country is the opposite. The wealth of national power is determined by this.</p>
<h3>Eastern Travel Correspondence (16)</h3>
<p>— Wu Xiaohou</p>
<p>The revival of Tokyo is a major undertaking. At 11:58 a.m. on September 1, 1923, the great earthquake in Tokyo was an unprecedented catastrophe in Japan's history. Japan was built on a volcanic mountain range, and minor earthquakes have been seen many times, but such an earthquake that destroyed Tokyo's more than 500 years of culture, factories, and all buildings, except for a part of the Japanese Imperial Palace, and at the same time, more than 80 fires broke out in the city, destroying everything into scorched earth for two days and nights, was a rare sight. According to the statistics, the total area of the 15 districts in Tokyo is 77.48 million square meters. Except for Ushigome Ward, the area affected by the disaster in the remaining 14 districts is about 34.6 million square meters. The number of buildings burned down is 219,000, the number of households is 366,000, and the population affected by the disaster is 1,484,000. The estimated damage is 3.7 billion yen, which is about 20 times the area burned down and 37 times the damage amount of the famous Great Fire of London in 1666 AD, which can be called a major disaster that is only seen in ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>After the great earthquake, Japan suffered great pain. The government and the public unanimously took measures to provide relief and recovery. The Japanese government established a recovery bureau in the Ministry of Interior to plan and implement the national recovery plan, such as the construction of main roads, the construction of canals, the establishment of large parks, the reorganization of land zoning, the subsidization of building costs in fire-prevention zones, and other small projects as government recovery facilities (government recovery facilities cost about 336.987465 million yuan). In addition, the Tokyo Prefecture Facility (Tokyo Prefecture Recovery Facility costing approximately 22.004036 million yuan) will revise national roads, construct ring and radial roads, and educational facilities. The Tokyo City established a city recovery bureau to plan and implement the recovery work of the entire city. Here, we will select key items to explain in detail.</p>
<p>(1) City Land Zoning Reorganization: The entire implementation area of Tokyo's land zoning reorganization covers 65 districts. In addition to the 15 districts with government facilities, the city facility area covers 50 districts. The reorganization cost is approximately 93.951 million yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Subsidy Line Road Construction: The subsidy line roads are built in succession to the main line roads. The total number of routes is 122, with an extension of 139,146 meters. The construction cost is approximately 82.111994 million yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Road Surface Paving and Bridge Reconstruction: Road surface paving and bridge reconstruction for the restoration and reconstruction of damage and new construction caused by the Great Earthquake includes 715,473 square meters of road surface paving, of which 400,554 square meters are newly built. There are also 154 bridges, of which 53 are newly built. The cost of paving and reconstruction is approximately 12.45332 million yuan. (4) Sewer Improvement: The first and second phases of sewer facilities were damaged by the earthquake. The cost of reconstruction and improvement of facilities, as well as the remaining works of the first and second phases, and the newly emerging works of the third phase, is approximately 40.211321 million yuan.</p>

(Silver Deduction) The transfer in the early market still opened at 2 fen, but the silver deduction was restored to white borrowing in the noon market. There has been no water added to the headline for a long time, and it was the same yesterday.</p>

<h3>Hanzhou Financial Situation Amidst Turbulence</h3>
<p>According to news from the financial sector yesterday, the financial situation in Hanzhou is currently very critical. All kinds of agricultural products from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are often interrupted because transportation cannot be fulfilled as desired. The losses to silver interest warehouses cannot be overstated. Currently, the minimum monthly interest rate for every 1,000 taels of Zhuang interest in Hanzhou must be over 20 taels of silver. If the buying and selling of Shanghai standard silver drafts is compared to spot transactions, the distance is always 8 or 9 taels, and at least over 7 taels. If the two deliveries at the end of the 15th of the month are often offset by telegraphic transfers, the losses are even greater. Currently, the foreign exchange funds are about 20 million, and are mostly stored in various banks and cannot be used as circulating market funds. Therefore, the market is very short of spot funds. Although there are banknotes in circulation, the selection criteria are very strict, and several types of Shanghai banknotes cannot be used.</p>

<h3>Yarn Sales Are Flourishing</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn sales are very prosperous. The specialized dealers are very intentional and eager to collect goods in the market. Therefore, the market atmosphere is getting tighter and tighter. Fortunately, other dealers have not yet launched, and the market situation has not been intense. However, Ruidu's short sellers are actively covering their positions, so the rising momentum is more vigorous. However, most of the local intentions tend to be selling, and the thinking is still flat. Gongtai, a large dealer, is adding leverage to the short side. In short, the actual demand is smooth, and the market disk is difficult to see a fall. Actual sales continue to increase, and there is still a rising trend in the future. However, the rising trend of three-piece yarn is more moderate.</p>
<h3>People Bidding Ruidu Covers Shorts</h3>

<p>Grain and River Rice Prices Fall Back</p>
<h3>Zhabei</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the number of suppliers arriving from various gangs was small, only a few. Sales in this street were stagnant. However, rice merchants with factory-produced rice and boat rice were quite eager to sell. Therefore, the North Rice market situation softened. High-quality short-grain rice and medium to low-quality rice all fell by two to three jiao. Moreover, buyers were scarce. The real reason is that new Kunshan rice has been successively entering the market and will arrive in Shanghai soon. Furthermore, every day, 400 to 500 shi of new Nanjing indica rice have been arriving. Most buyers are going directly to Nanjing to purchase. Sales in Shanghai are therefore poor, so the atmosphere in the market is unusually depressed. Although the supply of Dongxin rice is exhausted, it has also softened by two to three jiao. Top-quality goods have fallen to around 21 yuan. The overall average is only between 20 yuan 0.5 and 0.6 jiao. The arrival of thin rice is still scarce. The market situation is stable. Sales of flexible rice are balanced. High-quality rice is still priced at 19 yuan.</p>
<h3>South Shanghai</h3>
<p>Few boats are coming down the river, and sales are lackluster. Top-quality rice from the Chang gang continues to decline. Sales of Suzhou-Tong white rice are poor, and the price is slightly soft. The market for medium to low-quality rice is stagnant and quiet. Ordinary Suzhou-Tong rice opens at 19 yuan 3 to 4 jiao. The supply of Nanbang thin early rice is exhausted, and sales are flat. The price is high and stable, but the quality is soft. The price of white yuan rice is weak and similar to the previous day. The rice market is short by two to three jiao due to the difficulty in transshipment, and the trend is becoming weaker.</p>
<h3>Lively Atmosphere in the Imported Rice Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market saw flat transactions and prices did not rise, but the market was quite lively because various customer gangs were inquiring. Each gang was trying out a small amount of business, shipping out 300-3000 bags each. For example, the Qingdao gang shipped 1000 bags of Annan rice, and the Hankou gang shipped 300 bags of Saigon rice. Dalian, Wuhu, Andong and various gangs shipped out different amounts of Saigon rice etc, with shipment sizes ranging from 100-200 to 300-400 bags. Although the transaction volume was small, the market saw a lively atmosphere since all roads were simultaneously moving business. Scattered gangs in the North can also ship rice, and people's hearts are more stable. The market opened with 1000 bags of Annan rice at 16 yuan 9.5 jiao, 1500 bags of small Saigon rice at 14 yuan 7 jiao, 500 bags of large rice at 12 yuan 2 jiao, 500 bags of No. 2 Saigon rice at 13 yuan 9.5 jiao, 200 bags of Min Dang rice at 15 yuan, and 200 bags of Ke Gai rice at 14 yuan 6 jiao. If customer gangs are interested again today and tomorrow, the market will turn around.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Remarkably Buoyant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, all months were thriving. The opening price for this month was 2 liang 5 qian 1 fen, which immediately jumped up by 2 fen. In the afternoon, it rose by another fen. September to January all rose one after another, and the buying interest was very strong. The situation was remarkably buoyant. The reason is that although the ban on shipping to the North has been repeatedly opened and closed, yesterday imported rice could suddenly be shipped, and there was a boat of wheat flour with an estimated 60,000 to 70,000 bags being shipped out of Andong. Since the Andong gang can ship, they are trying their best to search for spot flour in the market. The spot market immediately rose by several fen. The closing prices were: August/September up 3 fen, October up 3 fen, November up 2.75 fen, December up 2.5 fen, and January up 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Near-Term Wheat Up 4 Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market opened very flat. Then, because wheat flour could be shipped north, wheat flour futures rose first, and people's sentiment followed suit. All months then rose. The closing price for August, September, October and other months was up 4 fen, and other months were up 3 fen. Since there is a market for spot wheat flour, spot wheat is even more necessary for factories. Fuxin's purchases were very greedy. The market opened with 8,000 bags of train goods, accounting for 80% to 90%. Top-quality aged wheat was priced at 5 liang 2.3 fen, and new train wheat was priced separately for high, medium and low grades. The future market is looking good.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea from Shanghai Factories Sold Through American Sales Channels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American firms in the Shanghai foreign firm silk market reported via telegrams from New York, San Francisco, and other places that they were more interested in purchasing Shanghai white factory silk through futures contracts. The market sentiment was firm. Yesterday, Qianli and others purchased 120 bales of September, October, and November Shanghai white factory silk. The price remained firm.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decrease in Autumn Silkworm Rearing in Japan</h3>
<p>Sales of Japanese raw silk to Europe and the United States are sluggish. Silk inventories are growing daily, and there is an overproduction. In order to adjust the silk market, the Japanese government is reducing the amount of autumn silkworm rearing. The second and third sleeps for autumn silkworms in each county is already here, and on average, the amount of rearing has been reduced by 50% compared to last autumn.</p>
<p>Piece Goods Market Sees Daily Rise</p>
<h3>Local Factory Cloth</h3>
<p>The market remained firm yesterday. Fine twill also rose. Yanghe opened at 7 liang 0.75 fen, Hunter at 6 liang 9.75 fen, and Blue Double Fish at 6 liang 7.75 fen, setting new high prices for this year. Sales were quite smooth, and local customers unanimously added to their orders. Demand from the North was still strong. More than 200 pieces were traded yesterday, with a high probability of further price increases. Blue Double Fish colored balls were all at 7 liang 0.05 fen, and Laba Tong had also reached 7 liang 0.025 fen. Coarse cloth was purchased most eagerly by the Guang gang. More than 100 pieces of 9-pound, 11-pound, and 16-pound goods were sold yesterday. The streets were also quite active because there were rumors that Zhejiang Province would cancel its special tax.</p>
<h3>East and West Piece Goods</h3>
<p>The market situation rose across the board. Eastern goods were again active. Tianjin gangs continued to search for goods. Demand from Zhenjiang and Ningbo gangs was also strong. Yesterday, fine broadcloth from Baotou Lake Pavilion, First Merit Tribute Satin, Zhongrui Moonflower Velvet all rose by 2 li. Zisun Fugui Soft Guang Xie rose by 5 fen and sold for 5 liang 6 qian. Gray Guang Xie rose by 2.5 fen, Qianli Ju Shuangdeli was 4 liang 7 qian 2.5 fen, Jinwengong 4 liang 8 qian, Zijinshan 4 liang 8 qian 2.5 fen, and Shuangtong Deer, Mo Qianshan Tribute Flannel also rose by 2 li. Because most Western goods were already in the hands of the trade, prices only rose and did not fall. Yesterday, Fair's Chongxi Satin was 3 qian 3 fen, and the Great Stage ruler-6 yuan velvet sold for 1 liang 2 qian.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Bureau’s All Inland River Vessels Chartered by Zhejiang Navigation Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>All Inland River Vessels Resume Service</p>
<p>The number of inland river shipping companies in Shanghai in recent years, the sluggishness of business, and the difficulty of navigation along the route are unprecedented. Upon investigation, the foreign merchants operating inland river vessels in Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places include Daishengchang and Datong, two Japanese firms, and Laogongmao, a British firm. Several years ago, business was very good, and the British and Japanese vessels all made great profits. However, in recent years, business has declined, and Japanese merchants have taken the opportunity to transfer Daishengchang to Chinese merchants and renamed it Yuantong. Datong has also been taken over by Chinese and renamed Qingji, while the Japanese, carrying their huge profits, have returned to their country fully loaded. Among inland river vessels, China Merchants Bureau has always occupied the first position in terms of business volume. Its routes cover Jiangzhe and the inland, and its ships and transportation are also larger than Daishengchang and others. However, in recent years, due to unrest in the inland, difficulty in navigation, limited cargo and passengers, and the increasing number of small companies, it has become difficult to sustain. As a result, China Merchants Bureau's inland river vessels have suspended operations, and inland waterway transportation has also been affected. This year, since the Zhejiang Construction Department established the Navigation Affairs Bureau, it has been striving to develop inland river transportation in the province. It has negotiated with China Merchants Bureau to charter all of the bureau's inland river vessels that have been largely suspended, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government has dispatched personnel to take over management. The charter agreement has been signed, and shipyards and other items have also been received. A formal plan is now being drawn up to fully restore all of the vessels that have been suspended for a long time. The details of this matter are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Navigation Affairs Bureau Committee Takes Over</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Navigation Affairs Bureau has chartered all of China Merchants Bureau's inland river vessels and has changed the Shanghai Suzhou Road General Bureau into the Shanghai Branch Bureau. A general management office has been established in Hangzhou, Zhejiang. The Navigation Affairs Bureau has specially appointed Chen Shuntong, a specialist in Shanghai shipping, as the general manager, and Sheng Nian as the deputy manager. Zhang Shusheng has also been appointed as the manager of the Shanghai Bureau. The name has been carefully determined as the Zhejiang Provincial Navigation Affairs Bureau's Chartered China Merchants Inland River Vessel Bureau. The charter agreement was signed in mid-June, and Mr. Chen and Mr. Sheng have already taken office. Recently, they have come to Shanghai to negotiate with the former bureau chief regarding the takeover of the bureau's ships, docks, tugs, and other matters. Since the first of this month, the entire operation has been under the command of the new general manager and others.</p>
<h3>Twenty-One Inland River Routes Resume Service</h3>
<p>After taking over the bureau's affairs, Mr. Chen and Mr. Sheng have decided to restore all of the routes that have been suspended for a long time. In recent days, they have been in contact with various ports in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to discuss the resumption of navigation. As of yesterday, the new bureau has formulated a plan to resume navigation on the following routes: 1. Shanghai-Hangzhou route, 2. Shanghai-Suzhou route, 3. Changli route via Wantazhai, Qiaozhai, Xushe, etc., 4. Xili route via Luoshe, Yixing, Yun Village, 5. Xicheng route via Qingyang, Tongcheng Township, 6. Shanghai-Jiaoze route via Huangdu, Qingpu, 7. Shanghai-Lingze route via Luxu, Pingwang, Shengze, 8. Shanghai-Huzhou route via Lili, Zhenze, Nanxun, 9. Suzhou-Dangze route via Nanqiao, Ganlu, 10. Suzhou-Changzhou route via Zhangjiatian, 11. Suzhou-Shengze route via Wujiang, Beichi, Xincheng, 12. Suzhou-Huzhou-Hangzhou route via Linghu, Xu Dian, Tangxi, 13. Xun-Jia route via Meiyan, Wangjiangjing, 14. Jia-Hu route, 15. Zhenjiang-Yangzhou-Guazhou route, 16. Zhen-Qing route via Yangzhou, Shaobo, Huaicheng, 17. Zhenjiang-Xiaohe route via Hejing, Hehuachi, Sanjiangtai, Tianxingqiao, 18. Xiashi-Haining route, 19. Changshu-Qingyang route, 20. Changzhou Butou route, 21. Changzhou Yangxiang route.</p>
<h3>Independent and Transparent Accounting</h3>
<p>The new bureau will eliminate previous malpractices and adopt a policy of integrity. Accounting will be independent. The bureau's accounting director will be Jiang Zhongxun, specially appointed by the Construction Department. All income and expenditure will be made public, and monthly reports will be submitted to the Navigation Affairs Bureau. The basic capital of the new bureau will be allocated by the Construction Committee.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Organization of Operations</h3>
<p>A total of twenty-one ships were received, plus twenty-one company ships. Among them was the "Jian Yuan" ship, which burns diesel fuel and is the latest model. The rest burn coal. Chen Shengjun is a specialist in the shipping industry. The most important aspect of ship operation is fuel consumption. Previously, round trips on the Shanghai-Hangzhou route required twenty tons of coal. Now, with Chen Sheng et al. personally supervising combustion and using higher-quality coal, each round trip only burns nine and a half tons. This could save over ten thousand yuan on coal for the twenty-one ships per month. In July, Chen Sheng and the other gentleman received the ships and test-operated them for a month. After expenses, they actually made a profit of three to four thousand yuan. Therefore, the new bureau believes there is a real possibility of reorganization and revitalization. The new bureau has now decided to maintain the current state of the routes within Jiangsu Province and gradually develop them, starting with expanding operations on the routes within Zhejiang Province.</p>
<h3>Extension of Land Registration in Jiangsu Province for Three Months</h3>
<p>Land registration in Jiangsu Province began on February 10th of this year and was originally scheduled to end on August 9th, a period of six months. The deadline has now passed. Registration matters in various counties have largely been delayed and neglected, resulting in no progress. However, the counties have repeatedly stated to the provincial authorities that due to disasters and famine in the past year, bandit and communist disturbances, or military influences, they have been unable to carry out the work effectively. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has now decided to extend the deadline for three months from August 10th to continue the work. Within this deadline, the counties must urge all districts to earnestly expedite the registration. If the deadline is exceeded again, those with verified deeds will be required to pay a fee, and those without verification will be fined double. Yesterday, the Shanghai County Government received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs to comply.</p>
<h3>British Warship Carries British Troops to Hankou Yesterday</h3>
<p>For the Purpose of Protecting Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The "Great American Evening Post" reports that the British warship HMS "Whitehall" was ordered to Shanghai from Weihaiwei and arrived at the Wusongkou this morning (August 8th). It immediately loaded the second batch of fifty British soldiers and set off for Hankou. These British soldiers were waiting in Songjiang in advance and will join the 110 soldiers who departed yesterday on the "Xiang He" steamship and be stationed on warships to protect overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warship Collides with British Steamer</h3>
<p>The Japanese destroyer "Kashi" was traveling from Shanghai to Hankou yesterday when it collided with a British steamer near Wusongkou. Both sides were unable to give way in time, and the bow of the "Kashi" struck the hull of the British steamer. The bow of the Japanese ship sustained only minor damage, while the hull of the British steamer was damaged. It came to Shanghai yesterday for repairs, while the Japanese ship continued to Hankou.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Promotes the New System of Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Complies with Orders to Promote</p>
<p>And Displays a Full Set of New Instruments</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received an order from the Municipal Government yesterday stating that the promotion of the new system of weights and measures depends on the publicity of the system, so that the general public can deeply understand the benefits of the new system and the drawbacks of the previous lack of uniformity. Currently, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has already produced and commissioned the Shanghai Zhonghua Book Company to publish real-life pictures of new instruments, comparison charts of the new system, and uniform procedures for the new system nationwide. The work has now been completed. Therefore, the Ministry is allocating and sending copies to the provincial and municipal governments for distribution to various agencies for publicity, examination, and verification. The Chamber is ordered to comply and widely publicize the system. If the aforementioned charts are insufficient, they can be purchased directly from the Zhonghua Book Company. After receiving this order, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has already displayed a full set of Ministry-approved new weights and measures at the Commodity Exhibition Hall for public viewing.</p>

Therefore, he sent a letter inviting the heads of districts 1236 to discuss ways to improve communication. However, only the heads of districts 2 and 3, Peng Lire and Yang Fulin, attended yesterday.

<h3>The Beima Section of the County Telephone System Begins Operation</h3>
<p>The Overall Plan for the County Telephone System is Being Drafted</p>
<p>The long-distance telephone project for the Beima section of the county has been completed. A few days ago, Wu Wenhua, Director of the County Construction Bureau, personally went to inspect and test the telephones and requested the Construction Department to send personnel for acceptance inspection. According to Director Wu yesterday, the project's results are very good. Non-official calls have begun in recent days as a trial and are not charged. The local people are competing to use them and feel very convenient. The regulations for telephone management and charging in this section have already been drafted and have now been approved by the county government and filed. The instructions from the Construction Department have not yet arrived. Formal calls will be implemented after the Department's acceptance inspection, charged at five cents per call. In addition to the installation of one telephone in Beima and another in Ruanjiazhai, two telephones are installed in other places for now due to funding issues. More will be added when the project develops in the future. After all district telephones in the county are fully installed, it will be even more convenient. A new plan is being drafted and will be completed soon.</p>
<h3>Commemorative Stamps of Revolutionary Martyrs</h3>

<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Requests the Customs to Abolish the Lunar New Year Holidays</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau stated that the central government has long ago issued orders and regulations for the promotion of the national calendar. The settlement periods for merchants and various festivals have also been recalculated and determined. However, it is heard that the Jianghai Customs in this city still has various lunar calendar holidays in its official holidays and closing dates, such as three days of annual leave from the first to the third day of the first lunar month, one day of summer festival leave on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, and one day of autumn festival leave on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month. Customs is a national tax authority. If it continues to use the lunar calendar, it will not only confuse people's perceptions but also hinder the promotion of the national calendar. It has sent a letter to the Superintendent of Public Affairs to inform the Jianghai Customs to abolish various lunar calendar holidays and change to complying with the national calendar.</p>

Yan Baoshu, the chairman, reported on the "Telegram No. 1713 from the East Express Telegram of the Provisional Reorganization Committee of the Hankou Special Municipal Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang," which stated, "The strike committee of the French Water and Electricity Company in Shanghai forwards [this message] to all workers. It is with concern that the long unresolved oppression and strike by the French company has resulted in the tragic incident of 7/21. All Chinese are filled with resentment. In addition to the 103rd regular meeting of our committee resolving to send a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promptly resolve the negotiations to protect national rights, we hereby send a telegram of condolence and hope to be informed at any time. (Omitted below)." A letter of thanks was immediately sent. Xu Amei reported that the workers were obeying discipline and waiting quietly for a resolution.</p>
<h3>Departure to Solicit Donations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Nanhua Goods Industry Union sent personnel to join the French Water and Electricity workers to start soliciting donations from the members of the industry. The members of the support committee also set out to solicit donations to maintain the spirit of the strike.</p>
<h3>Workers at Xiang Sheng Factory Request Rice Subsidy</h3>
<p>Can be Resolved in One or Two Days</p>
<p>Workers at the Xiang Sheng Iron Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, recently raised the issue that rising prices of goods have affected their livelihood. Therefore, they resolved at a general meeting a few days ago to request the factory to increase the rice subsidy by two yuan per person per month on the 5th of this month. The Municipal People's Training Committee had previously approved this matter. Zhang Linhua, the standing committee member of the committee, entered the factory and consulted with the general foreman Peng Si and the second foreman Yang Balo. The factory indicated its willingness to accept the request and promised to increase the monthly rice subsidy by one yuan for each worker. However, Zhang indicated that the current request was the lowest limit of the labor side and could not be conceded. The two sides negotiated for a long time. Finally, the factory agreed to investigate the price of rice since June and seek the consent of the board of directors, promising to reply within three days before dismissing the meeting. Yesterday, the three-day period had expired. The factory management sent a letter to Zhang to negotiate again. The negotiations lasted a long time and had not been completed by 5 p.m. It is said that the factory management is quite aware of the suffering of the workers, so the request is unlikely to cause problems and can be resolved in about one or two days.</p>
<h3>Craftsmen at the Railway General Factory Request Rice Subsidy</h3>
<p>Craftsmen in all departments of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway General Factory previously received orders to give those with monthly salaries of 51 yuan to 100 yuan a housing subsidy of 5 yuan 1 dime. Therefore, workers with general monthly salaries below 50 yuan specially elected Cai Jinhai and Tang Ziliang, the standing committee members of the trade union, as representatives to petition the superiors to request a rice subsidy. It has been approved that those with monthly salaries below 30 yuan will be given a rice subsidy of 11 yuan, to be paid when the July salary is issued on the 5th of this month. However, workers with general salaries above 30 yuan to 50 yuan expressed dissatisfaction because they received nothing. While they were discussing this, those who had already been promised a housing subsidy of 5 yuan 1 dime were also unhappy because they had not yet received the money. They gathered at the writing room to question the clerk Xiao Xiyang, who was in charge of the worker's accounts. Wang Chengzu, the Director of the Traffic Department, found out and came forward to dissuade them and promised that the housing subsidy of 5 yuan 1 dime per person would be issued to the workers below 50 yuan on Friday (yesterday). The workers then put forward the condition that the price of 12 yuan per stone of rice be taken as the standard. If the market price is 15 yuan per stone, a rice subsidy of more than 3 yuan will be added, and the subsidy will be calculated according to the increase in the market price. Director Wang of the Traffic Department agreed to report the situation to Director Liu for review and ordered the workers to return to the workshop to work as usual and await news. The crowd then complied and retreated.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Disposing of the Two-Line Pension Fund</h3>
<p>The Traffic Department of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau issued a notice to all employees of the lines yesterday, stating that Luo Panhui, the document committee member of the Two-Line Pension Fund, wrote to the effect that the two-line pension fund and the subsidy fund have now accumulated to more than 1.7 million yuan, most of which is deposited in various banks. Recently, the financial sector has been affected by high gold prices, and there have been moments of alarm. The fund is the capital of the workers' blood and sweat, and the relationship is very important. Article 21 of the Detailed Rules of the Association states that a part of the subsidy can be invested in reliable and profitable industries, but the investment method should be studied publicly to ensure stability. Therefore, a letter is specially sent to you and ask your director to forward it to all employees for their opinions on this matter. Please collect all opinions and reply by August 15 for a meeting to discuss and select the best option. In addition, it is heard that most of the two-line workers intend to ask the Traffic Department to investigate and distribute the money, as the current situation is causing high prices and high cost of living during the national crisis.</p>
<h3>The Sino-Japanese Labor Strike Is Still Difficult to Resolve</h3>
<p>Workers at the Rihua Cotton Mill in Pudong previously demanded a 10 cent increase in the rice subsidy from the factory management because of the high cost of living. They also demanded the cessation of Sunday night work and the elimination of intentional wage delays. It has been many days since then, but the two sides have been unable to reach an agreement. According to a reporter from Huadong News Agency yesterday, the union said that when the matter was raised, the management agreed to consider it. However, the attitude suddenly changed the next day, and the management went from a moderate to a tough stance and posted a notice at the factory gate, stating that it had received a letter of accusation from all the workers, accusing the workers Yu Qixiang, Gu Lanru, Ren Nianxi, Bu Linsheng, Hu Shoulin, Pu Xiangyun, and Wang Zhaozhu of instigating the incident. Therefore, the seven workers were publicly dismissed, and other workers were asked to resume work. The wording was groundless, but fortunately all the more than 4,000 workers were not moved. Therefore, the factory is still unable to resume work. However, as the delay has been prolonged, the workers' livelihoods are likely to be affected. Therefore, plans are being made in recent days. Yesterday, the Municipal Party Department was petitioned to remain calm and await the Municipal People's Training Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau. The reporter then went to the factory to investigate. The factory gate was locked. Only a Chinese official and Japanese guards were inside. When asked if the foreman Inoue was there and if there had been any news recently, they said that the foreman had not been to the factory for many days. The factory headquarters was in Caojiadu, and there had been no similar incidents. Therefore, the shipment of goods had not been affected. It seemed that they were absolutely unwilling to compromise on the strike.</p>
<h3>Jinpu and Longhai Borrow Money to Pay Salaries</h3>
<p>The Jinpu and Longhai lines have borrowed 100,000 yuan from the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines to pay part of their salaries as a result of reduced revenue due to the war, which has caused the salary to be delayed for three to five months.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Finance Bureau Rechecks the Bonds of Collection Personnel</h3>
<p>In addition to having to find reliable shopkeepers and fill out guarantee letters in accordance with regulations, which are subject to the Bureau's verification and approval before they can be appointed, the Municipal Finance Bureau has also stipulated that the bureau's revenue and collection personnel must be checked once every three months for safety. The bureau has now arrived at the check-up period and dispatched personnel to the collection offices to check the warrant shops of various guarantors, so the bureau's inspectors have been very busy lately.</p>
<h3>The County Government Solicits Indemnity Money</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received an order from the Financial Commissioner to issue an indemnity to the injured Cai Dehui and issue orders to forward it. A notification was sent to the address, but there was no such person as Cai Hui. Now the county government has posted a notice soliciting.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee Meeting</h3>

More than ten committee members, including Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaolai, Luo Qinghua, Yuan Ludeng, and Wu Zhihao, attended the meeting to discuss the following issues: (1) Discussing the Construction Committee's request to quickly submit fundraising methods and re-elect attendance representatives.

<h3>Minutes of the Municipal Citizens' Union Meeting</h3>
<p>Eight Important Cases Were Resolved</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Union held its seventh plenary meeting yesterday afternoon. More than 20 committee members attended. Zhang Yichen presided over the meeting. The secretary reported on the minutes of the previous meeting and various telegrams. Then, the following proposals were discussed: (1) The joint association of tenants in Ruikang Lane, Hongkou, sent a letter and dispatched two representatives to the meeting to report that the landlord, the Yeguang Company, was exceptionally harsh and requested assistance. It was decided to forward the three requirements put forward by the association to the Yeguang Company to uphold justice. (2) Lu Wenzhong sent a letter requesting a protest against the Public Works Bureau for piling up garbage in various places, hindering the health of the people of the city. It was decided that the matter was of concern to the interests of all citizens within the boundary and would be handed over to the Investigation Section for detailed investigation before sending a letter to the Chinese Director to protest. (3) Wu Jianguang and others from Nanjing Road requested assistance for the matter of the landlord digging up the house. It was decided to hand it over to the Investigation Section for investigation and then review it. (4) Should condolences be paid for the death of committee member Chen Wenbin due to illness? It was decided that the association would send condolences and members would make their own donations. (5) Committee member Wang Pingnan proposed that Fuzhou merchant businesses request assistance from foreign insurance companies who are attempting to evade insurance compensation. Wang Pingnan proposed the following measures: (A) Petition the central government to order foreign insurance companies in various places to register with the Public Works Bureau, otherwise they will not be allowed to operate. Chinese merchants should not be allowed to insure with unregistered foreign insurance companies, otherwise they will not be accepted in the event of a dispute. Committee member Jiang Xinzhao proposed that, based on the facts of this case, the association should issue a declaration to notify all Chinese merchants to switch to Chinese insurance companies to avoid being deceived by foreigners and suffering losses. It was decided to pass this resolution. (6) The regulations for the organization of the Rice and Grain Special Committee were submitted for discussion. It was decided to ratify them as originally written. (7) Committee member Yu Yangsheng reported that Zhang Maocheng Rice Shop in Haining Road sold rice at a fair price to relieve civilians. Should the association commend them? It was decided that the association would send a letter of commendation. Other proposals were discussed at the end of the meeting before it adjourned.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Joint Meeting of Representatives of Pharmaceutical Associations from Various Ports</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Pharmaceutical Associations convened a meeting of representatives from pharmaceutical associations of major ports at 6:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Cen Binghuang from the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Trade Association, Dong Bowei from the Shanghai Herbal Medicine Trade Association, Fang Huiqing and Fang Yiyuan from the Hangzhou City Pharmaceutical Association, Xie Zude from the Jiangxi-Hubei Chinese Medicine Research Association, Wang Ziqin from the Anhui Wuhu Pharmaceutical Guild, Cheng Diaozhi from the Nanjing Pharmaceutical Guild, and Gao Jianqing from the Shashi Chinese Medicine Association. Observers included Cai Jiping and Jiang Wenfang, directors of the Secretariat of the Federation; Zhang Shisheng and Cen Zhiliang, members of the Executive Committee of the Federation; Zhang Meian, director of the Organization Department of the Federation; and Ding Zhongying, director of the Economic Department of the Federation (who declared that due to transportation issues, he could not attend and requested notification of the results for consistency.  This included five locations such as Hankou City). After the meeting was called to order with the ringing of a bell, Zhang Meian was elected as chairman. The chairman then reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that last year, the Ministry promulgated regulations for the management of drug merchants. Because the Ministry did not fully understand the operations of the Chinese medicine industry, most of the provisions were not in line with the business situation. Drug merchants in various places suffered from the difficulty of complying with them, and they requested that a national conference of representatives of medical and pharmaceutical associations be held to send representatives to Beijing to petition for revision of the regulations for implementation. The Chairman of the National Government granted the request and allowed the matter to be referred to the Legislative Yuan for reference in order to revise them. Now, the Ministry of Health still issues orders to implement the regulations, causing drug merchants in various places to feel uneasy. Letters and telegrams are exchanged frequently, vying for response again. In order to understand the current situation in various places and solicit response methods, the Federation, with the Executive Committee's decision, convened representatives of pharmaceutical associations from major ports to carefully discuss the promulgated regulations, and designated the relevant department directors and executive committee members familiar with the pharmaceutical business to attend and participate in the discussion. Now, everyone braves the summer heat to attend the meeting. I admire your enthusiasm and hope that you will express your great views and discuss the details of this case in detail, which will be reported by the Secretariat of the Federation." Next, Jiang Wenfang, director of the Secretariat, reported on the progress of the case, stating that after the Ministry of Health promulgated the drug merchant regulations last year, drug merchants in various places expressed their opposition. In summary, the reasons and grounds for their opposition are generally no more than the following points: 1. The Ministry of Health lacked the participation of people from the Chinese medicine industry when formulating these rules, so the provisions did not conform to the Chinese medicine business situation. 2. The national health authorities have not yet been fully established and cannot be implemented. 3. The same laws and regulations for Chinese and Western drug merchants are detrimental to one or the other. 4. Management methods abandon the essentials, exceeding the necessary scope, delaying what should be urgent and expediting what should be delayed. 5. Local health administrative agencies lack talent for managing the pharmaceutical industry. 6. The government lacks cultivation and management preparation for the Chinese medicine industry, etc. Therefore, the Federation drafted detailed implementation rules based on the above points to supplement and remedy them, and presented them to the Ministry of Health, requesting adoption to facilitate implementation, but was not approved. Consequently, on December 1, a conference of representatives was held, resolving to request the government to revise the formal management regulations. At the same time, the Chinese medical community also felt restricted by the laws and regulations hindering the development of Chinese medicine, and resolved to gather all cases and send representatives to Beijing to request revision of the regulations in the sub-items. The Chairman of the National Government granted the request and referred the matter to the Legislative Yuan for reference, and the Legislative Yuan referred it to the Legislative Committee for handling. Since the matter concerned laws and regulations, it should be reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan, not arbitrarily handled by administrative agencies. The Federation immediately followed the precedent of the Industry and Commerce Law Review Committee and telegraphed the Legislative Committee, requesting the organization of a Chinese Medicine Law Review Committee for detailed discussion in order to achieve perfection. To date, the Legislative Yuan has not held this matter. As far as the files of this association are concerned, the regulations promulgated by the Ministry have become invalid with the President of the National Government's revocation of the laws and regulations restricting Chinese medicine. Before the Legislative Yuan has established formal regulations for the management of drug merchants, there is really no law to abide by. The Ministry of Health believes that if the new law is not born, the old law is naturally effective. The views of the local health administrative agencies are extremely inconsistent. In the current year, local separate regulations are formulated, or local medical and pharmaceutical associations are convened to properly formulate regulations for effective management, such as in Jiangdu County, etc., or separate regulations are formulated in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry, such as in Shanghai City, etc., or the fees are increased compared with the regulations of the Ministry, and pharmacy clerks must pass the examination and obtain a license before they are allowed to engage in the industry, such as in Xiamen, etc. Whether it is legal for local health administrations to separately formulate regulations after the promulgation of the Ministry's regulations is a legal issue that cannot be hastily concluded. However, it is clear that the regulations promulgated by the Ministry are difficult to implement. Drug merchants in various places, except for the first category such as Jiangdu, etc., all express opposition, such as the Shanghai category and the Xiamen category, and request the Federation to continue to lead them. The Federation, in view of the chaotic and unbearable problems of managing drug merchants, had to invite representatives of pharmaceutical associations from major ports to the meeting to discuss together, and also asked the chairman to ask the representatives to express their great opinions, etc. Cen Binghuang expressed his opinion, stating that since there is a clear instruction from the Chairman of the National Government in front and local separate regulations in the back, whether it is effective is no longer a problem. Dong Bowei expressed his opinion, stating that we are not opposed to management and are very willing to have reasonable management regulations, such as the methods in Jiangdu, etc. Fang Yiyuan expressed his opinion, stating that the impediment of the regulations promulgated by the Ministry lies in the same rules for Chinese and Western drug merchants, and those who formulated these rules did not understand the Chinese medicine business situation. In the future, formal management rules must be separately regulated for Chinese and Western drug merchants, and Chinese drug merchants must have the opportunity to participate in the discussion. After the representatives expressed their opinions, they submitted the following resolutions for discussion: (1) Promote a perfect, unified, formal law for the management of Chinese drug merchants (submitted by the Hangzhou Pharmaceutical Association). Resolution: (A) Please ask the Federation to continue to submit the original plan to the Legislative Yuan to expedite the establishment of formal regulations for the management of Chinese drug merchants. (B) Please ask the Federation to notify the pharmaceutical associations in various places to wait quietly for a solution to achieve consistency. (2) This association intends to express its inability to comply with the current management regulations for drug merchants, which are fragmented and obstructive. Please ask the Federation to solicit joint signatures from local pharmaceutical associations (submitted by the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Trade Association). Resolution: In addition to the participating groups, the Federation is allowed to send letters to solicit opinions. (3) How should we proceed if the goal of revising management regulations cannot be achieved? Resolution: (Secret)</p>
<h3>Dispute Over the Selection of Chinese Representatives to the International Medical Congress</h3>
<p>The National Medical Association's reply to the Medical College of National Central University states: "We are writing to inform you that our members, upon reading the cover advertisement in this year's June 18th Shen Bao and June 19th Xinwen Bao, which stated that 'I, Dr. Luo Aisi, am now going to Copenhagen, Denmark, on behalf of the National Central Medical College to participate in the International Medical Congress, etc.,' were unanimously shocked, believing that international academic conferences originally aim to promote academic exchange and enhance international standing. It seems inappropriate to rely on foreigners to act as proxies. We have always admired your institution as the highest institution of learning in the country, with professors of complete academic character, and believe that you would not waste resources to mislead the public. Therefore, at the seventh meeting of the Executive Committee, it was unanimously resolved to send a letter to your institution warning you to consider the national interest, promote academic exchange, and re-appoint domestic experts. If a suitable candidate cannot be found for the time being, it may be better to abstain from attendance. If a foreigner is sent as a representative, this Association will only send a telegram to the International Medical Congress to deny it. This is entirely the responsibility of national citizens to offer faithful advice and has no malicious intent. Just as we were about to send this letter, we received a correction notice and a letter from your institution on the 6th, denying any such action with strong language and severe reprimands. We are truly apprehensive. However, according to the aforementioned advertisement of your Professor Luo, he claimed to be representing the National Central Medical College in going to Copenhagen, Denmark, while your letter stated that you did not entrust Professor Luo to attend the International Medical Congress in The Hague. Since the locations of the conferences are so different and the statements of the two parties are contradictory, we suspect there is a misunderstanding. Our Association's motion was based on the aforementioned advertisement and was unaware that there was also an International Medical Congress being held in The Hague. Therefore, we did not dare to use the phrase 'irrelevant' in response to your letter. As for the fact that Professor Luo of your esteemed institution, the highest institution of learning in the country, personally declared that he was representing your institution in going to Copenhagen, Denmark, we still adhere to the resolution of the seventh meeting of the Executive Committee and send a letter warning you to clarify within three days whether you will declare the cancellation of the aforementioned advertisement or remain silent. Please provide details and publish them in the newspapers to dispel doubts. Otherwise, our Association will still fulfill the resolution and send the original advertisement and this telegram to the International Medical Congress in Denmark to deny it. We hope you will investigate. Sincerely, the National Medical Association, August 8."</p>
<h3>Cases to be Handled by the Standing Committee of the Red Cross</h3>
<p>The Health Bureau Urges Again</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau previously received an order from the Municipal Government notifying them of the National Government's approval of the reorganization of the Red Cross Society, and forwarded the information to the Standing Committee of the Society for compliance. Yesterday, Jiang Qudan, a representative of the Standing Committee, declared that he had not disrupted the Red Cross Society. The Health Bureau replied in a letter stating: "We are writing to acknowledge receipt of your letter, which stated that Jiang Qudan's letter claimed that the order to suspend him from his duties as a member of the Standing Committee was inappropriate, and that the accusation by Minister Wang and Vice Minister Zhang that he was the instigator of disrupting the third membership congress election of the Red Cross Society was unfounded. The 99th meeting of the Standing Committee reviewed and publicly agreed that Jiang Qudan has served the Red Cross Society for many years, and his diligent work has been meritorious. As for the accusation that Jiang Qudan was the instigator of disrupting the Red Cross, our Society has conducted a detailed investigation and found no evidence. Therefore, we have sent a letter on his behalf to appeal for clarification. We hope you will review and forward it to the superiors, etc." The matters previously ordered to be forwarded to your Society for compliance include: (1) Expeditiously convene a meeting of the Standing Committee to discuss and establish the election rules for members of the Standing Committee and the rules of procedure for the membership congress, etc. (2) Expeditiously have the Standing Committee notify the branches of the Red Cross Society by telegram or registered mail to convene the membership congress of each branch to elect representatives to attend the provisional membership congress, and bring official letters with the branch's seal as proof of attendance as scheduled. (3) Notify the General Office of the Red Cross Society to prepare all the procedures for holding the provisional membership congress in accordance with the general practice and regulations for holding meetings to avoid further complications. (4) When the membership congress is held, report to the government in advance to send personnel to attend and monitor the meetings every day. (5) Before the provisional membership congress is convened, the current members of the Standing Committee shall be responsible for exercising the supervisory powers of the Standing Committee in accordance with the articles of association. (6) Notify Jiang Qudan to immediately suspend his duties as a member of the Standing Committee, etc. The six items were sent in a letter on July 25 of this year for your review and reply. Now that Jiang Qudan's appeal only concerns one part of the entire case, the other important aspects, to what extent have they been handled? We have not received any information and request that you expeditiously implement the aforementioned items separately and provide a detailed reply for compilation and submission for review. Furthermore, since your Society has conducted a detailed investigation into the disruption, who was the instigator? Please truthfully disclose this information for submission and to ensure accuracy. This reply is addressed to Wang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese Red Cross Society.</p>
<h3>New Method of Smoking Cessation Advocated by the Anti-Drug Association</h3>
<p>Invented by Doctors Ke and Chen from Southeast Asia</p>
<p>Opium addiction is very difficult to quit once contracted. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association has always paid close attention to methods of quitting. In the spring, Huang Jiahu, the executive director of the association, went to Southeast Asia to inspect and solicit effective smoking cessation methods from well-known doctors in various places. At that time, Doctors Ke Quanshou and Chen Jinfang, overseas Chinese scholars in Batavia who had been researching smoking cessation methods for many years, recently invented a "Sleep Addiction Treatment Method" that is simple, safe, and inexpensive. Doctors Ke and Chen had tested it at the Yangsheng Hospital in that city. Dr. Wu Liande, a member of the Executive Committee of the Association, and Executive Director Huang had visited and were deeply impressed. Dr. Ke and Chen were specially commissioned to submit a detailed written report of the experimental process, which has now been sent. It is heard that the Association is preparing to have the Association's appointed doctors test the report and decide on the following methods. If this method can be implemented as soon as possible, all kinds of difficulties in quitting addiction can be solved easily, etc. (1) Publish the experimental report of Doctors Ke Quanshou and Chen Jinfang in the English quarterly and the Anti-Drug Monthly, and also introduce it in the domestic medical journals for testing. If the results are satisfactory, publish them together with the experimental process as a separate book to show advocacy. (3) Please ask the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, the Chinese Medical Association, the Shanghai Medical Association, and major hospitals to test this method and introduce it as much as possible. (4) The Association will contact enthusiastic individuals or groups to establish smoking cessation hospitals to implement this method of smoking cessation and set up training courses to teach this method. (5) If necessary, the Association may invite Doctors Ke and Chen, who invented this method, to return to China to promote it. (6) The implementation of this case should be carried out by the Standing Committee in conjunction with the Secretariat.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Case of Repairing the Tang Pagoda in Western Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs Submitted to the Ministry of the Interior for Record</p>
<p>Construction Has Started in Accordance with Regulations</p>
<p>The Shixing Twin Pagodas built in the Tang Dynasty in Pinghu County, Zhejiang Province, were subject to a demolition and sale issue. Feng Heng, Wu Jingshun, and others jointly telegraphed the Ministry of the Interior to oppose it. Then Shen Songqing and others petitioned the province to change the demolition to repair. However, County Magistrate Fang Li also advocated demolition, which aroused opposition from all the fellow villagers' associations in Hangzhou and Shanghai. As a result, Zhu Jiahua, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs of Zhejiang Province, sent personnel to investigate and found that the pagoda was indeed in line with the regulations for the preservation of ancient sites. After returning to the province to report, he ordered the county magistrate to earnestly plan for the repair. However, County Magistrate Fang did not reply for more than ten days. Shen Songqing and others telegraphed the province for instructions. Now, the province has approved: "The telegram has been received. According to the committee's investigation, the county magistrate was previously ordered to earnestly plan for the repair in accordance with regulations. At the same time, the Ministry of the Interior was ordered to approve the record. Please be informed." After receiving the approval, Shen and others invited the county magistrate to a meeting. The county magistrate did not arrive on schedule, and it was generally believed that this was a deliberate boycott. It was decided to follow the regulations and start the repair, which started on the 5th.</p>
<h3>Order Tax Offices Not to Obstruct Silkworm Seed</h3>
<p>The Zunyi County Chamber of Commerce in Guizhou Province previously requested to send personnel to the cocoon producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to purchase silkworm seeds and transport them back for seed production for the development of sericulture. When the seeds were transported to Hubei Province, the tax office there attempted to levy a cocoon tax and detained the goods. The Chamber of Commerce reported to the provincial government, which forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance for approval to exempt silkworm seeds from taxation. In addition to ordering the provincial government to order the tax office to release the goods, a circular was issued to all subordinate tax offices to comply with it to avoid obstruction.</p>

<h3>Tears of the Xiang River</h3>
<p>Communists Bring Disaster, Homes Destroyed, Families Ruined</p>
<p>A Youth Escapes the劫, Throws Himself into the River</p>
<p>A Sad and Bitter Letter</p>
<p>This time, when the Communists captured Changsha, they burned and killed everywhere, and countless people suffered. It was truly an unprecedented disaster in the capital of Hunan Province. What is recorded in this article is one of the survivors of the劫. Seeing the pain of a family displaced, he attempted to commit suicide by jumping into the river. A Hunanese man named Liu Jin, 25 years old, was a handsome young man who had held an important position in the army. Two years ago, when the troops were reorganized by the Central Government, Liu resigned due to a foot disease and remained unemployed in Changsha for a long time. He was very poor and unexpectedly encountered a Communist disaster. Nine members of his family, men and women, fled on a轮 amid gunfire and shelling, via Hankou, to Pukou. His old mother died on the way. On the 3rd of this month, when he arrived in Pukou, his sister-in-law committed suicide by hanging herself. His hardship was indescribable. Fortunately, he was rescued by his former military commander, Wang Xijun, the current captain of the Capital Security Corps, who purchased a coffin and hastily buried the two corpses of his mother and sister-in-law in the same coffin. Liu then came to Shanghai alone to find a friend but was unsuccessful. Feeling that his life was so miserable, he also conceived the idea of厌世. At about 11:00 AM yesterday, he took a Nisshin Company Anshan Maru ferry from the Wuma Road Pier in the Public Concession to Pubei. When it arrived in the middle of the river, he jumped into the river, hoping to join the波臣. Fortunately, the轮老大, Tang Dexi, immediately stopped the ship and rescued Liu, who was lucky enough to be reborn. He was then sent to the Customs Water Patrol Room. A suicide note was found on his body. After questioning by the chief, the details were learned. Because he had a friend in Shanghai named Liu Jusheng, who currently lives at 44 Chun Geng Li, Qipan Street, Hua detectives Ge Changsheng, Cheng Yongnian, and Huang Songsheng were dispatched in the evening to find him so that Liu could be rescued as much as possible. His suicide note was several hundred words long, detailing his life experience and the various miseries suffered by his family in this Communist disaster and refuge in a foreign land. Although the words were not very smooth, one could generally glimpse the plight of the victims. The words were full of tears and blood and could not bear to be read. It is hereby transcribed below without deletion.</p>
<p>"The suicide, Liu Jin, a native of Hunan Province, 25 years old, from an academic background. Graduated from Changsha City Tenth National Primary School at the age of nine, Changsha Affiliated Higher Primary School at the age of twelve, and Mingde Middle School at the age of seventeen. Because of family poverty, he was abandoned from then on. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, he was admitted to the Beijing National Army Officer School for half a year, but returned due to illness. In October of that year, he recovered from his illness and joined Cai Junzhang Zhuyou's Tenth Brigade Cavalry Battalion, Fourth Company, in western Hunan as a sergeant. In the twelfth year of January, he was promoted to the third platoon platoon leader. In the thirteenth year, after fighting with Zhao Hengti and being defeated, Cai ordered the entire army to retreat to Longxikou and stop. After being reorganized by He Yaozu, I and others did not follow and went straight to Guangdong to join Sun Zongli's department to assist in the revolution. Unexpectedly, many died of illness on the way due to rugged roads and lack of food. I ran to Guangzhou and took the fourth term of Whampoa. When I was admitted to the school, I had a serious illness for two months. After recovering from the illness, I was introduced by a fellow villager to the First Army, Second Division, Fifth Regiment, One Battalion, Two Company of the National Revolutionary Army as a special affairs chief. In the fifteenth year of June, he was promoted to the captain of the Fifth Regiment's Courageous Squad during the Northern Expedition. On August 3, during the Wuchang Campaign, he suffered a severe gun wound to his left foot. He was sent to Renji Hospital in Shanghai by the military department for treatment. In the sixteenth year of January, his bones were completely healed and he was discharged from the hospital. He was introduced by a friend to the Thirty-sixth Army Special Service Company as the company commander. In July, he was transferred to the military department as an adjutant. At the beginning of January of the seventeenth year, Tang, Li, Liu, Zhou, Liao, Jiang, and others fought with the Central Government, and as a result, they retreated to Xupu and were reorganized by the Central Government. At that time, because my feet were swollen and it was difficult to move, I sold a long vacation and went home to recuperate. Up to January of this year, the family's daily life was incomplete, so I took four old paintings hanging at home to Shanghai for sale, but I was disappointed. I am unfamiliar with the place in Shanghai and have no money. Later, I was taught by someone to go to 44 Chun Geng Li, Qipan Street, Liu Ju Ji to ask for help. I was treated with kindness by Mr. Ju Sheng, who borrowed fifty yuan without setting a repayment date. Later, I returned and heard that on the 27th of last month, the Communists captured Changsha and set fires everywhere and discovered many deviations. I have lived at 157 Banxiang Street, Changsha for a long time, which is on the right side of the Asia Hotel. On the night of the 28th, the Communist fire burned Changsha and my house suffered the same disaster. It happened that my mother was seriously ill and had nowhere to live, so on the 29th, I took a Japanese轮 to Hankou on the 31st to seek help from friends. Unexpectedly, four of my brothers have gone to Qingdao. My third brother died in the Nanchang Campaign. My elder and second brothers work in Yan's department. They have not returned for half a year and their whereabouts are unknown. It is pitiful to abandon my elder and second sisters-in-law and four young children. My wife, Wang, and my mother, a total of nine people, cannot live in Hankou. I had to beg the Taikoo Suiding Ship's comprador Zhang to find a way to go to Nanjing to seek help from Wang Xijun, the captain of the Nanjing Police Department Security Corps (I was his old subordinate), and also ask for work to support the whole family's life. I did not expect that my mother would die on the way. On August 3, I arrived at Pukou and took the corpse ashore together. At that time, there was nowhere to live. Later, a straggler saw the suffering and took me to live with him in Lugia Village in the countryside (this person is from Yuezhou, Hunan). I ran to the city to meet Captain Wang of the Security Corps and talked about all the suffering. Wang raised donations for me and asked me to take the position of sergeant to support the family's life. At that time, because my mother was not buried and the family had no place to live, I replied that I would report later. I returned to Pukou at 7:00 PM that afternoon. My sister-in-law committed suicide by hanging herself. The next morning, I went across the river to Wang's place to continue talking about my sister-in-law's affairs. Seeing my suffering, Mrs. Wang gave me 20 yuan and raised 32 yuan, totaling 52 yuan, and ordered me to return quickly to deal with it. However, the cost of everything in Nanjing is high. A coffin costs 30 yuan. At that time, I had no choice but to buy a coffin and buy clothes, lime, quilts, etc., totaling 47 yuan. I temporarily put my mother and sister-in-law in one coffin and prepared to bury them together, but there was no righteous mountain there. The Lu family gave a great blessing and bought a piece of land one zhang two chi wide for the righteous price of 20 yuan, paying 5 yuan first and returning the rest within three days. I paid him 5 yuan and buried my mother and sister-in-law. That night, I wanted to come to Shanghai to seek help from Cai Junzhang and others. Although I heard that he lived at 3 Ruizhi Li, Muer Ming Road, I had not been there and did not know if I would be rescued if I met him. I wanted to go several times but had no choice because the family had no food, clothing, or shelter, and the land price was not cleared. I wanted my mother and sister-in-law to sleep in separate coffins, so I sold the small spun long shirt I was wearing for 4 yuan and 4 yuan and 6 jiao and 2 fen for a train ticket. I arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM on the 6th and ate a meal costing 3 mao. Then I went to Muer Ming Road to look for it but did not find it. I really had no face to go to Liu Ju Ji to ask for help again, and there was no way to return to Nanjing. I wandered around Shanghai City for two nights. Until today, I cannot take care of the whole family mentally. In addition, the environment has been too unsatisfactory in recent years, so I throw myself into the river to die. If the corpse floats, please inform the Cai Residence at 3 Ruizhi Li, Muer Ming Road to collect the corpse to ensure hygiene."</p>
<h3>Female Doctors Whip a Corpse</h3>
<p>Liu Yulian Gains a Son, Loses a Wife</p>
<p>Liu Han Suffers Injuries All Over Her Body</p>
<p>Liu Yulian, a native of Jiangbei, whose wife, Liu Han, lived at 5 Xiangyun Li, Fen Shui Miao, Hujia Muqiao, North Shanghai, is 24 years old. They have been married for several years, and the relationship between the couple has always been very close. Recently, Han was pregnant with her sixth child. On the previous day, her full term was reached and she gave birth to a child. Liu was overjoyed. Unexpectedly, the parturient woman was frightened after giving birth, causing blood stasis to rise, immediately closing her breath and dying. Liu was extremely sad and immediately went out to buy clothes and a coffin to prepare for the burial. However, the generally well-meaning people in the neighborhood all said that the parturient woman was frightened and closed her breath, and her heart was still warm and could be cured. At that time, Liu was deeply grieved by the loss of his wife, and he was distraught. He did not approve or disapprove of the words of the neighbors. Unexpectedly, the neighbors did not wait for the consent of the family and immediately invited Jiangbei female doctors Chen Cai and Zhou Zhang to come. The dead woman's clothes and pants were taken off, and her body was naked. The two female doctors each held bamboo slats and whipped the corpse up and down in sequence. After more than an hour, the corpse was covered with scars, and there was no intact skin. However, the soul could not be returned. A steel needle with a peppercorn was used to arbitrarily prick the heart, abdomen, and head of the deceased, causing the corpse to be covered with wounds. The corpse was too horrible to look at. The family members who witnessed the tragic situation were even more悲愤. Therefore, the deceased's mother, Han Zhou, and the deceased's cousin, Zhou Dabao, and others twisted the two female doctors to the Third Section of the Fifth District. Under the interrogation of Director Zhang Guirong, the female doctors were accused of using witchcraft to make money and harm the corpse, which was extremely cruel. A document was immediately prepared to report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Fang Qichang of Lifeng Straw Hat Company Extorted</h3>
<p>Detective Wang Disguised as a Representative</p>
<p>A Password Apprehends Three People</p>
<p>The Lifeng Straw Hat Company at 36 Fuzhou Road, Sichuan Road received a letter on the 28th of last month, mistakenly writing Lifeng as Xiangfeng, and the owner of Lifeng, Fang Qichang, was also mistakenly written as Fang Zhenjin. After the company read it, they knew it was a threat letter from a bandit, demanding 5,000 yuan. Fang Qichang ignored it because the brand name and person's name were completely wrong. Unexpectedly, on the 4th of this month, he received the same letter, scheduling a meeting in five days for someone to go to the entrance of the Dachina Hotel on Xizang Road to negotiate. The person going should carry a shoe box as a marker. Fang then sent the two letters to the General Patrol Room and requested an investigation. The chief sent detective Wang Shunlin, detective Tian Jinfu, Zhang Xiaolin, etc. to go as scheduled. When they arrived at the location, detective Wang disguised as Fang's representative, and other detectives disguised themselves and lay in ambush nearby. After a while, a Ningbo man named Chen Qinglai came swaggeringly. Wang recognized him as the other party based on his appearance. He approached him and invited Chen to talk in a slightly remote place to avoid eavesdropping. Chen said that there were two others waiting behind him. He returned and discussed with the two. At that time, with a password from detective Wang, the lurking detectives swarmed up and arrested Chen and the other two together and took them back to the patrol room for interrogation. The other two, Tang Songshou and Hu Dechen, were all from Ningbo. They were sent to the Special District Local Court yesterday morning. Judge Xu interrogated them. The patrol room's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, requested a postponement on the grounds that further investigation was needed. Judge Xu interrogated Chen and Tang. The two defendants confessed to sending the threatening letter, but claimed that there was another instigator. Hu's confession was completely evasive. The court ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Joint Shanghai-Moganshan Transportation Service</h3>
<p>Trains, Automobiles, and Mountain Sedan Chairs</p>
<p>Implementation on the 10th of This Month</p>
<p>In the past, tourists traveling between Shanghai and Moganshan purchased joint transportation tickets from the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway for trains, steamboats, and mountain sedan chairs. Since the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau's buses have reached Shou Village, taking a bus from Hangzhou to Shou Village and then switching to a sedan chair to ascend the mountain has become faster than using steamboats. As a result, the steamboat business has implicitly been eliminated. However, there was no joint transportation arrangement between trains and automobiles. It was extremely inconvenient for passengers traveling to and from the mountain from Shanghai to carry luggage and belongings. Recognizing this, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway negotiated a joint train-automobile-mountain sedan chair transportation contract with the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau in the spring of this year. After repeated consultations, the agreement was finally settled recently and is scheduled to be implemented on August 10th. For those traveling from Shanghai to the mountain, take the second train departing from the North Station at 7:00 AM or the fourth train departing at 9:00 AM on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to Hangzhou. Then, transfer to a bus to Shou Village, and finally switch to a mountain sedan chair to ascend the mountain. For those traveling from the mountain to Shanghai, take a mountain sedan chair to Shou Village, transfer to a bus to Hangzhou, and then take the third train departing from the City Station at 9:50 AM or the ninth train departing at 6:05 PM on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to Shanghai. Fixed seats are reserved on the trains to match the number of joint transportation tickets sold, so there will be no temporary seat shortages. All detailed information and procedures for purchasing round-trip joint transportation tickets can be obtained by contacting the information desk at the North Railway Station. From now on, luggage and belongings can be transported directly, which is truly good news for travelers.</p>

<p>According to the "Great American Evening Post," Mrs. Baldwin, a British resident of this city, will hold a grand Chinese banquet tomorrow (the 9th) to celebrate her 90th birthday. Mrs. Baldwin was born in 1840. She is not only the oldest among the foreign residents but also the one who has resided in Shanghai for the longest time. She came to Shanghai sixty-seven years ago to marry Mr. Baldwin. After several voyages with her husband, he passed away in South America. Mrs. Baldwin returned to her home country once, but then came back to Shanghai, where she has remained for fifty-eight years without ever traveling elsewhere. She told reporters that she already considers Shanghai her hometown. If she were to return to her home country now, she would not recognize anyone, and it would feel like going to a foreign land. Therefore, she intends to spend her remaining years in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Hu Lianquan, a Native of Chuanshan, Proposes the Construction of the Chuanshan Guildhall</h3>
<p>Direct Transportation of Coffins... To Benefit the Poor and Provide Convenience</p>
<p>Letters Sent to Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai... Seeking Sponsorship to Make It Happen</p>
<p>Chuanshan Town, under the jurisdiction of Zhenhai County, serves as the main entrance and exit for the three townships of Yan, Tai, and Hai under Zhenhai County, and the two townships of Xie Nan and Xie Bei under Dinghai County. Tens of thousands of Chuanshan natives reside in Shanghai. In the past, when people from Chuanshan Town returned to their hometown, they had to detour through Ningbo. Even coffins from bereaved families had to pass through the Siming Public Association in Ningbo. The detour had no impact on affluent families in Chuanshan, but it caused great inconvenience and suffering to impoverished bereaved families. Since the establishment of direct shipping between Shanghai and Chuanshan, transportation has become more convenient, and there is no need to detour through Ningbo. However, the transportation of coffins still follows the previous practice without any changes. Recently, Mr. Hu Lianquan, a Chuanshan native who works for the Shanghai Sanbei Steamship Company, often saw fellow townsmen and women crying and supporting coffins at the docks while traveling between Shanghai and Chuanshan for work. This was especially common during the Qingming and Winter Solstice festivals. Moved by what he saw, Mr. Hu asked about the reasons and learned about the inconvenience of detouring coffins and the inability to afford transportation costs. Moved by this information, Mr. Hu proposed to follow the example of Dinghai by purchasing land in Chuanshan and building a Chuanshan Guildhall and subsidiary buildings so that bereaved families of impoverished Chuanshan natives in Shanghai could directly transport coffins back to their hometown. This would provide convenience and save transportation costs. However, Mr. Hu felt that the matter was too significant for him to accomplish alone. He drafted a proposal outlining the current situation and facts regarding the transportation of coffins, as well as the need for and benefits of the construction project. He earnestly requested sponsorship from the prominent businessman Yu Qiaqing to facilitate the early completion of the project. After reading the proposal, Mr. Yu greatly admired it and agreed to provide sponsorship in person. He also instructed Mr. Hu to first seek the support of fellow Chuanshan natives and business leaders in Shanghai to jointly contribute to the charitable cause. Therefore, Mr. Hu has now joined forces with fellow townsman Mr. Hu Zhizhai to begin soliciting support. It is expected that fellow Chuanshan natives, who care about their hometown, will fulfill their duty and jointly work together to achieve the project early and benefit impoverished fellow townsmen.</p>
<h3>Continuing Report on the Guo Ju'an Appeal Case</h3>
<p>Guo Ju'an and the American Chase Bank are involved in a lawsuit concerning a guarantee dispute. Dissatisfied with the first instance judgment, Guo Ju'an filed an appeal. The details of the trial proceedings have been reported by this newspaper. It has been learned that Chaozhou merchant groups have paid significant attention to this case. It is also understood that, in addition to citing "the lack of standing of foreign legal persons" in the appeal petition, the petition also states that the appeal in the first instance was illegal. Further details are provided as follows: (Defense of Rightful Restraint: In litigation, the defense of rightful restraint refers to a situation where, during the continuation of a lawsuit, another lawsuit is filed with the same parties, the same cause of action, and the same subject matter, seeking the same claim, either through a principal lawsuit or a counterclaim. If the lawsuit has already been restrained, a defense of obstruction can be raised based on rightful restraint. According to Article 294 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the restraint of litigation begins with the filing of the lawsuit. In the first instance of this case, the appellant was the defendant. Before the appellee filed the lawsuit on May 15th, the appellant had already filed a lawsuit against Zhang Songzhou, the compradore of Chase Bank, on May 10th, listed as General No. 5255 of the 18th year. Because the appellant filed the lawsuit before the appellee, rightful restraint naturally arises according to the rules of litigation. The appellee cannot file another lawsuit based on the same cause of action. However, the first instance judge failed to examine the provisions of Article 295 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which state that a party cannot file another lawsuit concerning a matter under litigation restraint. Instead, the judge dismissed the plaintiff's (i.e., the appellee's) claim based on Article 290, Section 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The appellant had already clarified this point in the original trial, but the trial judge did not make a ruling. Therefore, the appellee's lawsuit in the first instance was actually illegal and should be resolved first.)</p>
<h3>No Negotiations Regarding Aerial Advertising</h3>
<p>This newspaper reported yesterday that the British-owned Brunner Mond &amp; Co. had specially made a balloon for aerial advertising and attempted to release it from the platform on the third floor of the Yufeng Cigarette Paper Store at No. 393 Avenue Edward VII in the International Settlement. However, negotiations with the store had not been completed, leading to a dispute. It is now learned that Brunner Mond &amp; Co. only rented the advertising space for the balloon and did not have any disputes with the store. Once the advertising manager finalizes the arrangements, the balloon will be released for aerial advertising every night at the location where it was tested on the first day.</p>
<h3>Press Conference Discusses the Wu Suzhong Case</h3>
<p>Requests the Court to Adjudicate According to Law</p>
<p>Zhou Xiao'an is Recommended to Attend the Hearing as an Observer</p>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists' Association held a temporary emergency meeting of its executive committee at the association at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 8th) to discuss the case of Wu Suzhong, a reporter for the Shishi Xinbao (The China Times), who was arrested. Zhou Xiao'an first reported that Wu Suzhong, a reporter from their newspaper (Shishi Xinbao), had been arrested this time under accusations of being a Communist suspect. After investigation by the police, no evidence was found, so no charges were filed. Subsequently, the police transferred him to the Second Branch of the Higher Court, which then transferred him to the Shanghai Special District Local Court due to jurisdictional issues. He is currently still in custody. Wu is usually honest and cautious in his service at the newspaper and has no reactionary tendencies. According to his family, the accusation stems from a minor dispute with a Mr. Xu over the division of public funds when he was assisting Mr. Zhang Xingyuan, a lawyer. They are requesting the association to appeal on his behalf so that he can be exonerated. After discussion, the committee concluded that since Wu's arrest had been investigated by the police and no evidence was found, and no charges were filed, the accusation of being a Communist may be a misunderstanding. (The resolution) is to send separate letters to the Shanghai Special District Local Court and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, requesting them to adjudicate according to law. Zhou Xiao'an was also publicly recommended to attend the hearing as an observer and report to the association in writing.</p>
<h3>Extortionist Kong Shaotang Sentenced to Twelve Years</h3>
<p>Last year, the Sanyang Nanhua Store on Nanjing Road repeatedly received threatening letters demanding extortion money. The store manager, Ni Baofu, did not want to cause trouble and provided a small amount of money to avoid further harassment. However, the extortionists' greed was insatiable, and they recently resumed their tactics. The store staff followed them to the Shenzhou Hotel and reported them to the police, who arrested one suspect, Kong Shaotang. Gu Weixin was also arrested as a suspect. This case was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou of the Special District Local Court continued the trial and concluded by sentencing Kong Shaotang to twelve years of imprisonment. Gu Weixin was found not guilty.</p>
<h3>Arrested for Performing Abortions on Women</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Road Qinghefang Venereal Disease Sanatorium is owned by a Mr. Yang, who serves as its director. Officially, the sanatorium specializes in treating leucorrhea, venereal diseases, and other conditions. However, it also secretly performs abortions on women, which is against the law. The Zhabei Police Station learned about this and sent detectives to investigate. After confirming the facts, a Chinese detective took a woman and pretended to request an abortion. Mr. Yang immediately proceeded to perform the surgery. The woman cried out for help, and the detective entered the scene and took Mr. Yang and the surgical instruments to the police station. They were then sent to court for trial to uphold humanitarian principles.</p>
<h3>Women Smuggling Military Supplies for Others</h3>
<p>Two Women Detained Separately</p>
<p>Jiangbei women Chen Zhu and Wang Zhang were arrested while transporting five box-shaped pistols and 605 rounds of ammunition for others on Wuzhou Road. They are being questioned and detained. However, the two women firmly refuse to reveal who they were smuggling the military supplies for, making it impossible for the police to investigate. It has only been determined that Chen Zhu has engaged in this type of activity more than once and was previously punished but has not learned her lesson. Yesterday, the Special District Local Court continued the trial. The police lawyer requested strict punishment. After questioning, Judge Feng sentenced Chen Zhu to two years of imprisonment and Wang Zhang to one year and six months of imprisonment. The seized ammunition was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Woman Reprimanded for Abusing Maid</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Six Months' Imprisonment</p>

<p>Hong Li, a Ningbo woman residing at No. 10 Dingning Lane, Avenue Haig, in the French Concession, recently subjected her ten-year-old maid, Wang Suxiang, to all kinds of abuse without cause, resulting in injuries all over her body. Wang Yuqing, a Chinese detective from the French Concession Police Station, learned about this and went to the residence to take Li and the maid, Suxiang, to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the French Concession Court for trial. First, a French deputy inspector stated that, according to the examination by a Western doctor, the maid had bruises and bite marks all over her body. He submitted the medical report for review and stated that the defendant had committed a crime under Article 293 of the Criminal Code and requested punishment. Next, Wang Suxiang stated that because her parents had passed away, she had been sold to the plaintiff as a maid. After only four months, she was often beaten and bitten with teeth. Her injuries have not yet healed, and she requested an examination. Hong Li confessed that her husband was in the theater business and that she had beaten Suxiang because she did not perform her duties well and had stolen items. The woman admitted that she was wrong, but she was currently six months pregnant and about to give birth. She requested leniency. After reviewing the case, the Chinese and Western judges ruled that Li should not have abused the maid. Considering her pregnancy, she was sentenced to six months of imprisonment at the women's prison, with a five-year suspension of the sentence. Suxiang was sent to the Jiliang Institute for care.</p>
<h3>Attempted Indecency with Daughter Fails</h3>
<p>Harbors Resentment and Chops Father</p>
<p>Yan A'si, a 55-year-old Ningbo native, lives at a certain address on Route Conty in the French Concession. He has two daughters who work as factory workers in a sock factory. The elder daughter is already married. The younger daughter, named Caibao, is seventeen years old. When the two daughters were working in the factory last year, a male worker, Mr. Jia, found the elder daughter attractive and attempted to seduce her, but failed. It is said that Mr. Jia has now been forced by his parents to marry a coppersmith. Harboring resentment, Mr. Jia broke into Yan's house yesterday around noon, while Yan and Caibao were having lunch. Without saying anything, he raised a knife and chopped A'si on the head five times and Caibao on the hand twice, causing them to bleed profusely. People reported the incident, and the No. 127 street patrol car was dispatched to send them to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Zhang Genlin Illegally Detains Wife</h3>
<p>Shackles Her Feet and Locks Her in a Dark Room</p>
<p>The Township Police Detect and Arrest Him for Investigation</p>
<p>Zhang Genlin, a villager from the Shenjiaxiang Huatingtou area of the Yinxiang District in the northeastern part of this county, is known for his violent temper. His wife, Zhang Xu (also known as Xu Xiuling), is often abused by her husband and is even deprived of food all day long. Therefore, she fears her husband like a tiger. Zhang Xu was betrothed to Zhang Genlin by her grandmother when she was seven years old. They were married in the winter of 1928. However, after less than two months, Zhang was unable to support her and sent her back to her mother's home. All of Zhang Xu's dowry was pawned off by Zhang Genlin to support his extravagance. To make a living, Zhang Xu had no choice but to work in a factory to support herself. In July of this year, Zhang Genlin planned to sell Zhang Xu. Zhang Xu refused, so Zhang Genlin hated her intensely. In late June, he shackled Zhang Xu's feet with large shackles and locked her in a dark room, depriving her of food for ten days. The patrol police from the Military Industry Road Police Station of the First Division of the Seventh District learned about this. On the night before last, they went to the address and heard a woman crying inside. They knocked on the door and entered, finding a woman huddled in a corner, weeping, with a gaunt face and emaciated body. They asked her what was wrong and learned that she was Zhang Xu. They checked her feet and found that she was still wearing shackles. The police immediately arrested Zhang Genlin, but he had already fled. They took Zhang's father, Zhang Songbao, and the victim, Zhang Xu, to the police station (without removing the shackles). Zhang Jiguang, the police chief, investigated the case and learned that Zhang Xu had been subjected to repeated abuse. Zhang was furious that Zhang Genlin dared to possess illegal instruments of torture and impose private punishments, disregarding the law. He immediately ordered the police to arrest Zhang Genlin and bring him in for investigation. He also temporarily detained Zhang Songbao and Zhang Xu, pending a formal report to the headquarters and transfer to the court for thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Adulterous Couple Caught Together</h3>
<p>Guo Cairen, from Gaoyou, works as a farmer in his hometown. His wife, Guo Zhao, is 21 years old. Because she could not make a living at home, she came to Shanghai last year to work and lived in the home of a fellow villager, Ji Li, on Xingjia Wooden Bridge Coal Ash Road. Guo also came to Shanghai last month and worked as a laborer at the Kaiping Bureau in Pudong. However, Guo Zhao had been influenced by the Shanghai atmosphere for more than a year and, under the instigation of Ji Li, fell in love with Wang Hongbin. Because her husband was not around, she felt uninhibited and often invited her lover to her home, acting like a married couple. On the night before last, Guo Cairen suddenly felt amorous and returned home. After entering the room, he saw Wang and Guo Zhao lying in bed together. He immediately seized them, along with Ji Li, who acted as a pimp, and reported them to the First Division of the Fifth District Police Station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Local Court for trial.</p>
<p>New Couple Argue for Divorce</p>
<h3>Lu Fubao and Wu Caizhang</h3>
<p>Lu Fubao, a woman from Pudong, and her husband, Wu Caizhang, recently had disagreements. Lu Fubao hired lawyer Chen Jinrong to file a petition with the Local Court requesting a divorce. Her petition stated that the marriage was based on deception with the intention of obtaining property and requested the annulment of the marriage contract to protect her personal rights and recover her losses. The plaintiff, without parents or siblings, had been living comfortably on her late husband's inheritance for several years. However, due to the rising cost of living, it was difficult to sustain her lifestyle. She intended to remarry to provide for her basic needs. Xu Qing's wife seized the opportunity and introduced her to the defendant, Wu Caizhang. Through various sweet-talking methods, they entered into a marriage contract and lived together. Within a month, the plaintiff's clothes and ornaments had been pawned off, and she was subjected to poor treatment. Therefore, she requested the annulment of the fraudulent marriage contract and the recovery of losses amounting to 274 yuan. The defendant, Wu Caizhang, also hired lawyer Huang Yiyan to file a response, stating that, because he was unmarried, he had married the plaintiff on the sixth day of the third lunar month of this year through a matchmaker, Xu Qing's wife, a friend of his brother. The bride price was agreed to be 200 yuan and a silk dress. Initially, they lived in harmony, but after a month, the plaintiff's behavior changed. She often went out, and he repeatedly advised her against it, but she ignored him. On July 5th, she secretly took away her valuables and clothes, indicating her intentions. Now, she has suddenly filed for divorce, clearly because she has found another lover. The defendant has already spent about 400 yuan on marrying the plaintiff, and they have only been married for four months. How can the marriage contract be dissolved? He cannot ignore the sacrifices of others. He requested the court to consider the difficulty of poor people marrying and to order them to live together. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Tong Shenglv specially opened the Second Courtroom for the trial. The plaintiff, Lu Fubao, testified that she was 28 years old, a local resident of Yipin Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, No. 234, and recounted the previous events, requesting the annulment of the marriage contract. The defendant, Wu Caizhang, testified that he was 32 years old, a Ningbo native living on Baoshan Road, and worked as a headman at a dance hall. He did not want to separate and requested to live together, and also recounted the events. The judge, considering it necessary to call witnesses, ordered both parties to appear in court again at 8:00 AM the next day (i.e., today) for continued trial and instructed the defendant to invite his mother and sister to court for verification.</p>
<h3>Li Mianlan and Gao Guixian</h3>
<p>Li Mianlan recently hired lawyer Zhuang Dingxun to file a lawsuit with the Local Court against her husband, Gao Guixian (also known as Gao Guixuan), for repeated beatings and severe insults, requesting a divorce. Her petition stated that the plaintiff currently resides at No. 64 Qiwun Lane, Datong Road, Zhabei. She was married to the defendant on April 13th of this year through a matchmaker. After entering the family, they were only on good terms for ten days before he began to dislike her. Initially, he cursed at her. Then, he began to punch and kick her. He used knives and wooden sticks. They had only been married for two months, but she had been beaten more than ten times. He also insulted the plaintiff by accusing her of adultery with others and having an affair with her father-in-law, publicly insulting her and making it impossible for her to stay in the family. Therefore, she had no choice but to divorce him. The defendant, Gao Guixian, hired lawyer Zhang Xingyuan to file a response, stating that before the marriage, they had a romantic relationship and even took photos together and agreed to go out for walks. Their relationship was very harmonious. He had not only never beaten her, but had also never said harsh words to her. However, the plaintiff's father, Li Xianglin, regarded the plaintiff as a rare commodity and had other intentions. He incited the plaintiff to fabricate facts and claim divorce in order to achieve his goal of profiting. The defendant had never injured the plaintiff and swore to heaven that the medical report was fabricated. The witness, Yang Li, was a relative of the plaintiff and could not provide effective testimony. The defendant had spent all his money on the bride price and did not have the ability to remarry. The plaintiff had been sold into a brothel at the age of seven and learned to sing and play musical instruments. At the age of eleven, she escaped from the brothel, and her father arranged for her to marry a man from Pudong as a child bride. Later, she often borrowed money from the man from Pudong without success and even became involved in a lawsuit. Not long after, her father secretly took her back to Shanghai. In April of this year, she married the defendant. Now, he has incited the plaintiff to steal 190 yuan from the defendant's father's rotating credit association and all his jewelry and clothes. His intentions are prohibited by law. He has always pretended to be someone's wife in order to defraud bride prices and steal items. Therefore, he filed a petition requesting a dismissal so that they could remain married forever. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Jinjian opened the court for trial. Both parties arrived with their lawyers and presented their accounts. The judge ordered the two parties to try to reconcile outside the court. If they failed to reach an agreement, another hearing would be scheduled.</p>
<h3>A Battle Between Two Husbands and One Wife</h3>
<p>Zhang Lang, from Haimen, lives on Lujiabang Road, Sanguantang Road. His wife, Zhang Xu, is 35 years old. Because Zhang was unemployed and unable to support the family, Zhang Xu became involved with Cui Tinggui. The two husbands and one wife lived together peacefully. Cui and Zhang Xu had a son who is now four years old. Recently, Zhang had found a job as a cook. Zhang Xu discussed with both husbands that the household expenses should not be borne by Cui alone and should be shared equally. However, Zhang, because he was now able to support his wife, did not want to wear a "green hat" anymore and wanted Zhang Xu to live with him exclusively. Zhang Xu was reluctant to abandon Cui Tinggui, leading to a conflict. The police from the precinct brought the two husbands and one wife to the Second District Police Station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Local Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Naked Man and Woman in Bed</h3>

<p>Lu Wenqing Commits Adultery and Violence</p>
<p>Tang Kuizhang, a 36-year-old from Zhenhai, and his wife, Chen, are the same age. The couple rely on farming for a living in their hometown, and their relationship has been harmonious. They have four sons, the eldest being 16 years old. Earlier, Tang had been introduced to a job at the Shanghai Tonghe Transportation Company. After accepting the job, he resided on the upper floor of a Da Bing (large pancake) store at the entrance of Hengdefang, Wangjia Pier, in the southern part of the city. Chen remained in their hometown. Tang earned only a little over ten yuan a month in Shanghai, so the amount he sent home for household expenses was limited, making it difficult for Chen to manage their living expenses. Furthermore, she was not accustomed to sleeping alone. A man named Lu Wenqing, a 34-year-old who traded in foreign goods in the same town and knew Tang, saw that Chen was attractive and took the opportunity to seduce her. Chen, attracted by his wealth, agreed to his advances, and they soon engaged in illicit behavior. Tang did not return home all year, and Lu went to her house every night without any hesitation. Last September, Lu came to Shanghai for business and discussed it with Chen. Chen wrote a letter to Tang, falsely claiming that she had long admired the prosperity of Shanghai and wanted to come and visit. Tang agreed. Chen and Lu took a boat to Shanghai. After arriving, Chen went directly to Tang's place to meet her husband, while Lu stayed with relatives at No. 42 Haining Road. Whenever he had time, he often went to Tang's place to continue their affair. Sometimes, Tang would encounter them, and they would claim that Tang's wife owed him money and had come to collect it. Tang did not know the truth, so he could do nothing about it. On the evening of the day before yesterday, Tang went to work at the company after dinner, working the night shift. Late at night, around 12:00 AM, he finished work and rushed home. After going upstairs, he saw that the door was ajar and walked into the bedroom. He suddenly saw Lu and Chen lying in bed together, completely naked. Chen and Lu immediately woke up and jumped up. The two men and women then became violent and grabbed Tang, beating him severely. Tang, unable to resist, shouted for help. The sound reached the outside, and Su Haiqing, a security guard from the Fifth Station, rushed to investigate. He saw the naked men and women and ordered them to put on their clothes before taking them to the First Division of the First District Police Station. The station chief conducted a preliminary investigation and, considering the matter involved adultery, formally reported it and transferred the suspects to the Shanghai Local Court for trial.</p>

He was hit by four bullets in the head, right waist, right leg, and left foot, and immediately fell to the ground and died. The murderer fled. A French patrolman passing by noticed the scene and reported it to the Baojian Road Police Station, which ordered detectives to carry the body to the post-mortem examination room of the Tongren Fuyuantang Hospital to await examination. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The police station dispatched detectives to investigate, but no family members were found. Yesterday, the Criminal Section of the French Police Station reported to the French Court. Judge Zhu presided over the examination at 2:30 PM. After taking his seat, the police inspector reported the findings of the investigation. Judge Zhu declared that Ye Miaoji died from gunshot wounds and that no family members were found. He ordered that photos be taken, a coffin be prepared by Tongren Fuyuantang, and the body be stored for collection. He instructed the police station to strictly pursue the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Under the Guise of a Private Flower Club</h3>
<p>Fined 80 Yuan, Imprisoned for One Month</p>
<p>The offender, Chen Alu, recently set up a private flower club at No. 36 Deshan Lane in the French Concession, using communication devices to entice people to gamble. The French Police Inspector discovered this and raided Chen's house the day before yesterday, seizing flower club documents and silver dollars. He was taken to the police station and presented to the French Court yesterday for prosecution. The Western Inspector first explained the situation and interrogated the defendant, who admitted to setting up a private flower club with communication devices. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Chen to a fine of 80 yuan, to be confiscated. Furthermore, for violating the regulations by returning after leaving the country, he was sentenced to another month of imprisonment in the Western Jail. After serving his sentence, he will be permanently expelled from the Concession.</p>
<h3>The Henan Relief Association's Aid to War-Affected Civilians</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou Xiwen, the representative of the Henan Provincial Relief Association stationed in Shanghai, recently received a telegram from the provincial capital, which is recorded as follows: "To all charitable organizations in Shanghai: According to a report from Luo Chuanming, the Magistrate of Qi County, the county has fallen into a war zone, and all grain, fodder, carts, horses, and laborers have been requisitioned by various armies, resulting in extreme hardship. The war has raged within the county for 43 days, destroying countless houses, and people have died in large numbers. As a result, the wheat has not been harvested, and corpses are scattered across the fields, unable to be buried. Those who survived the catastrophe are crying out for food. Qi County is located in a strategic location, and the war has been particularly fierce. The losses suffered by the people are incalculable, and those who have died or been displaced urgently need rescue. We earnestly hope that all philanthropists will show great compassion and provide extensive relief. Respectfully, Li Shican, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Relief Association." After receiving the telegram, Representative Zhou went to various charitable organizations in Shanghai to present the situation of the disaster and plead for immediate relief.</p>
<h3>The Jisheng Society Continues to Allocate Loans for the Minsheng Branch Canal</h3>
<p>The Minsheng Canal in Qi County, Henan Province, which is funded by the China Jisheng Society, is 40 li long and can irrigate thousands of acres of fertile land, generating significant profits. The canal project has now been completed. The total investment is more than 80,000 yuan. Qi County has raised and the government has allocated a total of about 50,000 yuan. The Society has loaned 30,000 yuan. This huge project is generating substantial profits. According to a legal estimate, even if it cost 200,000 or 300,000 yuan, it would be worth it. Now, it has been completed for only 80,000 yuan. The reason is that using labor for relief is twice as effective, and the workers are mostly experienced and skilled, with some who are willing to sacrifice their families to alleviate the disaster. As a result, good results have been achieved. The work has been inspected and found to be solid and reliable, and the waterway is convenient and beneficial to the fields. However, in many places where branch canals have been opened, there are still outstanding wages for completed work. Because Qi County has accumulated deficits over the years and cannot borrow money, the original handler of the project negotiated a loan contract with the Society. Mr. Dong Junhengqu, the person in charge, wrote to request a loan of 2,000 yuan to pay for the labor of repairing the scattered branch canals, which would further improve them. The Society agreed that the water conservancy project would be beneficial for hundreds of years. Since this small amount of outstanding wages cannot be resolved due to the years of famine, it is sincere and earnest to negotiate with the Society for a loan. They have to work together to help others. It has been agreed to continue to loan 2,000 yuan for labor relief, which will be remitted soon.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Buddhist Pilgrimage and Sightseeing Group</h3>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from Tianjin</p>
<p>Staying at Lingshan Temple</p>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Pilgrimage and Sightseeing Group arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Tianjin on the Fengtian wheel. The travelers are staying at Lingshan Temple outside the Dananmen Gate in this city. It is said that the purpose of the group is to inspect the current situation of Buddhist education and the thoughts and lives of Buddhists in various Buddhist countries in East Asia. The aim is to connect Buddhist culture at home and abroad and to unite Buddhists around the world. The trip is scheduled to last for three years. They are now in Shanghai to handle travel matters. Once everything is ready, they will start their journey. The group's travel plan is briefly recorded as follows: (1) Japan, (2) Siam, (3) Myanmar, (4) India, etc.</p>
<h3>Ning Shao Company Expands Business to Include Water, Fire, and Life Insurance</h3>
<p>Petition to the Bureau of Social Affairs</p>
<p>In addition to its shipping business, the Ning Shao Company in this city has had a ship water and fire insurance department for many years, which has been quite successful. Recently, its shareholders decided to establish separate water, fire, and life insurance companies. The general manager of the company, Yuan Lidung, submitted a special petition to the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, stating that the company has accumulated 250,000 national currency in ship insurance. After discussion by the shareholders, it was decided to set aside 125,000 yuan to establish a water and fire insurance company and to use the remaining 125,000 yuan to establish a life insurance company, following the example of Sincere Company. This is because it is easier to set up a department under a company, and the shareholders remain the same. The general manager is the company's director and supervisor, like the advanced countries. Also, companies such as Swire, Mitsui Bussan of Japan, and others in this city have established other businesses as subsidiaries. China's industry is still young. In addition to Wing On and Sincere, there are no other successors. Therefore, in addition to operating the shipping business, the company plans to add water, fire, and life insurance companies, still using the name of Ning Shao Merchant Shipping, but with each being an independent entity. However, the company's regulations and the provisional rules of the National Registration Bureau do not have provisions for this type of registration. Therefore, the reasons for the establishment are presented for approval and interpretation so that they can be followed.</p>
<h3>Fifth District Police Officer Loses Badge</h3>

<h3>Linqing Road</h3>
<p>At around 9:15 PM last night, Sun Qimei's iron factory on Linqing Road in Yangshupu was careless. Fortunately, the Yangshupu Fire Brigade rushed to the scene immediately after receiving the news and extinguished the fire in a short time.</p>
<h3>The Most Complete Scientific Product</h3>
<p>Dr. West's Toothpaste and Toothbrush</p>
<p>Dr. West's Toothpaste is the most popular in the United States, with sales of 15 million tubes last year. Daily use keeps teeth white and smooth forever, and the mouth feels fresh and cool after each brushing. Smokers will find it especially useful. This toothpaste can remove food debris from between teeth and buildup on tooth enamel, and it can also firm gums and prevent dental problems forever. The toothpaste tube is made of pure tin, so the toothpaste will never change color. Dr. West's Toothbrush is also different from the rest. The design is particularly small, and the bristles are convex. Ordinary toothbrushes can only brush the surface of the teeth and cannot reach the back of the teeth directly. Dr. West's Toothbrush, because of its small and convex shape, can penetrate deeply into the back of the teeth, so it can brush every spot. The bristles are of the best quality. Dentists around the world agree that Dr. West's Toothbrush is the most complete. It is reported that a large batch of Dr. West's Toothpaste and Toothbrush has arrived in China for sale, exclusively distributed by Zhiwei Company at No. 25 Renji Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Recent Trends in the British Literary Scene</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>There are three major events in the British literary scene this year. First, the sensation caused by war novels across the country; second, the unusually large number of literary figures who have passed away; and third, the good fortune of poets. We will discuss them one by one.</p>
<p>In the spring of this year, several new war novels were published in Britain. The best one is probably "Her Privates We" (the meaning of these three words is only understood by British soldiers, and we respectfully decline to translate them). It is said to be the best war novel in the world, even better than "All Quiet on the Western Front." However, so far only Britain (excluding Ireland) is excited about this book. The author is anonymous and uses the pseudonym "Private I9022."</p>
<p>Later, a capable young writer and publisher came out to oppose him. He published a pamphlet saying that everyone treats the events of the war as a nightmare rather than as a part of history. This is not right. This pamphlet actually caused some influence. Subsequently, in daily newspapers, weekly newspapers, and radio broadcasts, a group of nightmare supporters and history supporters debated with each other and took pride in it. As a result, there was still no conclusion. As for the greatest British war novel, it has not yet been produced, and no one knows whether it will be produced in the future. However, everyone now feels a bit annoyed by this question.</p>
<p>The Death of Lawrence</p>
<p>Was not an unexpected event because he had been seriously ill for a long time. However, British public opinion is very divided on his criticism. Some scold him as a nymphomaniac, while others praise him as unprecedented. Both are biased. In fairness, he was indeed a genius. However, there are many narrow and bitter places in his later works, which inevitably reduce the artistic value of the works themselves. Locke (W.J. (Locke), a romantic novelist who was good at writing about circus characters and French life, is also a newly deceased British literary figure. His works are numerous and very popular. They have some interest but no profound meaning, so he can only be considered a second- or third-rate writer.</p>
<p>Two Female Novelists</p>
<p>Have passed away. One is Romer Wilson, the wife of Edward Obrien, an American short story editor. Her death was not mentioned in newspapers or publications. However, there was a time, a few years ago, when she was very prominent and was considered the most promising young female writer in Britain. At that time, her "The Death of Society" won the most important British literary award, the Hawthorn Prize. Her works put modern subjective writing into a fairy tale-like atmosphere, so they have a unique flavor. Unfortunately, she later failed to meet everyone's expectations and died unnoticed. The second female novelist is Lady Ball, also a not very famous novelist. In the British translation world,</p>
<p>The Best British Translator</p>
<p>Scott Moncrieff has passed away. He was the translator of two great French writers, MProust and Stendhal. His translations are not only beautiful translations but can even be considered real creations. It is not easy for a translation to be so good. Therefore, the death of Scott Moncrieff is indeed a great loss to the British translation world.</p>
<p>Literary criticism has always been very developed in Britain. There are many kinds of literary criticism publications, including quarterly magazines, monthly magazines, semi-monthly magazines, and weekly magazines, and the most numerous are weekly magazines. The one with the longest history and oldest qualifications among the weekly criticism magazines is "The Saturday Review." However, internal problems have recently occurred in this weekly magazine, involving the authority and personality of the editor, which has become a topic of discussion in the London literary scene for a while. The truth of the matter is this: The chief writer of the Saturday Review was originally Gerald Barry, but Barry was only the chief writer and not the owner of the magazine. In the spring of this year, the owner of the magazine changed his political views and published an article in the weekly magazine without seeking Barry's consent. This method is of course considered acceptable by the owner, but Barry did not change his political views. Therefore, he believed that the owner's actions deprived him of his authority and insulted his personality, so he was furious and protested and resigned immediately. Moreover, not only he himself resigned, but all the special contributors, contributors, and even clerks, typists, and proofreaders resigned together. Moreover, within half a month, a new weekly magazine,</p>
<p>The Week End Review</p>
<p>Not only announced its publication but actually printed it out and sold out completely in a few days. Until now, this weekly magazine is still selling very well. The old contributors to the previous "Saturday Review" are writing articles for it. In addition, famous people such as Shaw and Bennett have joined in to help, so the content is even more exciting and better than the Saturday Review. Barry's independent spirit and perseverance have therefore won a lot of praise. British weekly magazines have always been backed by wealthy politicians, so the opinions of editors and writers are inevitably restricted. The "Saturday Review" incident is an excellent rebellion against this phenomenon, and therefore it has gained the sympathy of many people.</p>
<p>The Poets' Good Fortune</p>
<p>Came with the death of the former Poet Laureate, Dr Beidgss. The attention caused by Bridges' death and the public's speculation about the successor to the Poet Laureate have greatly increased the sales of works by several major British poets. The first to be lucky was naturally John Masefield, the newly appointed Poet Laureate. Because of this sensation, the sales of his poetry collection doubled compared to before. In addition, poets who published new poetry collections during this period were also lucky. Humbert Wolfe is one of them. His new book, "An Uncelestial City," received long and complimentary reviews from various newspapers and magazines, which also brought some fame to the poets. In addition, the South African poet Roy Campbell, although also British, is a new figure in the poetry world, so his poetry collection "Adamarsto" has won a lot of praise.</p>
<h3>The Story of World Literature (185)</h3>
<p>— Written by John Macy, Translated by Hu Zhongchi</p>
<p>Chapter 48: Essays and History of America</p>
<p>His style, though adorned with various redundancies of rhetoric, is firm and pure. According to the testimony of his contemporaries, Webster was a speaker with powerful voice and dignified attitude, giving a deep impression. Carlyle, who did not have excessive goodwill towards political speakers—or towards Americans—also spoke of Webster's "rock-like strength." He did not always win, because the problems he dealt with were often inherently fragile. However, he has gained a definite place among those who are both world speakers and writers.</p>
<p>Lincoln developed a commendable style from the very beginning of his career. He reached that level through diligent work, not, as the general legend of the Lincoln story says, through the miraculous gift of genius to the ignorant. He was extremely sensitive, extremely wise, cautious, deliberative, and exceptionally endowed with that rare thing misnamed common sense. To this was slightly mixed the illusion of superstition and prophecy. This belongs to the historical politician, not to literature. His style is roughly described as follows:</p>
<p>Please read the Gettysburg Address (Note 1) again, treat it as a short prose poem, a work of art. In a few words, he expresses the emotions of that moment, and he expresses that emotion in a calm and steady style, without embellishment, without high-pitched cries, and with a rhythm carefully planned for the effect he wanted to produce.</p>
<p>Note 1: The speech Lincoln gave at Gettysburg during the Civil War after defeating the Southern Army.</p>
<p>Lincoln's articles are mostly filled with earnest enthusiasm, because he had many difficult problems to solve. However, he also had a lot of humor, which was the salt of his articles and a practical weapon against those who sought office and those who came to harass him. He made them laugh in order to protect himself. When he summoned his cabinet members not to consult them about the Emancipation Proclamation, but to report his decision, he first read several pages of Artemus Ward's (Note 2) works to them. However, after the start of the war, by nature and by circumstances, he was far removed from the agile politician who wanted to tell jokes to the audience in order to win votes. A sad man with a definite purpose and personality, even a politician with policies that we cannot agree with, also learns the use of words. This is one of the lessons learned from the study of expression. Caesar, Cromwell, Napoleon, Bismarck, and Lincoln (remember that I only classify them together from the perspective of studying literature) are masters of a style that is suitable for their work and suitable to the point that it has not yet lost its life. As for criticism, art, and what I think is the extremely bad color of Americanism, I will leave it to prompt the reader to think about it: of all the politicians in the world—please think of Pitt, Disraeli, Gladstone, and whoever from France—Lincoln has the most beautiful and strongest literary color.</p>

<p>Book and Newspaper Introduction</p>
<h3>Tired Cuckoo's Song, Flying Willow Catkins</h3>
<p>— Yang Qiyun</p>
<p>Published by the Founding of the Nation Monthly Magazine</p>
<p>Two days ago, I saw this advertisement in the newspaper: "The first work of the Three Principles of the People literature and art, 'Tired Cuckoo's Song, Flying Willow Catkins,' is published." This stirred me up! But on that day, I was so entangled in my busy work that I couldn't find the time to buy the book and immediately satisfy my desire. That was the reality. I had to endure it, letting my longing grow for a day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, having some free time, I rushed to buy this first work of the Three Principles of the People literature and art. On the way to the bookstore, it seemed as if the streetcar was deliberately trying to make things difficult for me. But no matter how difficult it made things, my desire would eventually be satisfied. Without ceremony, on the way back, I sat on the streetcar and read about a fifth of it in one breath. When I got home, I naturally disregarded all other matters and read it to the end without taking my eyes off it.</p>
<p>To say that "Tired Cuckoo's Song, Flying Willow Catkins" is a creation of Three Principles of the People literature and art, I think it would be more accurate to say that it contains a nationalistic literary color.</p>
<p>"...God, only now have I joined a formal and great battle. I fight for this lovely ancient nation, I fight for this venerable and long history, I fight for this beautiful and magnificent land, and at the same time, I fight to eliminate all feudal remnants."</p>
<p>Isn't this a clear expression of the spirit of striving for the nation? We believe that the war for national survival is necessary and valuable. In the seventh section of the book, this kind of strength, courage, and perseverance are created everywhere, indicating that the future of life is bright. How touching are the words of the character Chu Sheng! He really seems to give people an excitement, allowing them to open their hearts and live bravely, and also enabling them to forget the misfortunes of life, understand the true meaning of life, and even more, enabling the weak in the crossroads to abandon their original decadent thoughts and move towards the positive and bright path of life. Seeing what Chu Sheng and Song Qing said, Song Qing was moved to tears.</p>
<p>Song Qing must decide her own fate. External oppression is not entirely irresistible, and others are powerless to help her decide her fate. Happiness can only be obtained by those who are self-reliant and self-respecting. Song Qing, even if you are in a desperate situation, it is worth it. Even if you die alone, you should die happily. A muddled death is just a special gift from God to the weak. Song Qing, I don't believe you are absolutely hopeless. I believe you have great hope. Song Qing, where has the fire of your life gone? Aren't you looking for it? Song Qing, this is a very easy thing. Quickly find the fire of your life and burn it! Song Qing, how sincerely we expect and hope for it!</p>
<p>People's future is naturally full of infinite hope and endless and great undertakings. Can small setbacks and slight obstacles dominate our great lives? In recent years, the general public has had a considerable awareness of many issues, but naturally, in the old environment, such freedom is not allowed. The latent power in the old environment will naturally come to obstruct everywhere. However, these young people have no way. They only have the ability to realize, but no courage to fight. As a result, they embark on a path of negativity. The so-called youthful era disease is thus accumulated one by one. Song Qing cannot escape this exception. "She is a half-new, half-old character, she knows how to reject shackles, but she doesn't dare to break the famous teachings." She is too tightly forced by Chu Sheng's fierce stimulant. She can only cry. She still has no courage. She is still bound by "old credit and vows." The stubborn old concepts of inheritance do not know how many promising young people have been lost. "What's the use of talking about revolution or no revolution? It's better to solve this problem more practically and concretely." This is indeed the root of our Chinese national character. "To conquer the heart is supreme, to conquer the city is secondary." The Chinese national character transformation movement is the great mission that general literary writers should take on.</p>
<p>Is this a revolutionary literary work? I think everyone must also admit that it is a love work. While advocating conscious ideological reform, it also writes about delicate and pure love everywhere. They are in love with each other, but they do not express it in frivolous actions and language. They only exist in the depths of their hearts, and they both understand that she is willing to present her entire soul to him, and how profound is her affection! Seeing her New Year's greeting letter sent from home, with two red plum blossoms attached, using flowers to speak her mind, how could the recipient forget the beautiful and affectionate writing?</p>
<p>...Chu Sheng, I'm sending you these two plum blossoms, I'm afraid your nose has long forgotten the fragrance of two years ago...Chu Sheng, she is indeed lovely. Her loveliness is not only in the floating fragrance, but in her jade-like heart and bones, in her ice-like integrity...Chu Sheng, please take good care of her. You should look at her often, don't let her feel lonely, but you are not allowed to approach her, otherwise it will make her suffer or even die young...Chu Sheng, stay with her as long as you can. Don't worry in advance that she will wither...Chu Sheng, although she is silent and coldly facing you, she does not reject your love...But Chu Sheng, feel free to love her passionately, just don't forget the one condition that you are not allowed to approach her...</p>
<p>Having received such a deep enjoyment, if it were an average young person, how would they linger and forget his great mission? But the male protagonist in our book does not show it in his actions, neither closely nor distantly. He is not driven by passionate love and intoxicated in the enjoyment of beauty. He still does not forget his own great cause. He gets the opportunity to save the country and the people. He has no hesitation and no fear. He uses swift means to cut through the mess, clearing away obstacles and sweeping away everything. No matter how entangled the environment is, the entangled environment is not enough to stop his great journey. When weighing the pros and cons, he made such a decision: "If it is said that it is good for you personally to love you, it is better to say that as long as I hope you can serve the people and society, it is not a pity to sacrifice yourself. This is what it means to love you."</p>
<p>In short, this book takes into account both revolution and love. While arousing the central consciousness, it also wants to generate the power of life from the writing of love, not to be too intoxicated in the passionate river of love, nor to simply write dry and dull words. In the process of passionate and pure love, it is mixed with powerful consciousness, unconsciously infusing this consciousness into the reader's mind, so that the reader recognizes the great path that life should take. This is where the value of this book lies.</p>
<p>The male protagonist of this book is a promising young man who is rich in emotion, reason, courage, and perseverance. In the decadent and declining Chinese nation, it is really hard to find many. The female protagonist, Song Qing, can be found everywhere in these recent years of the new and old process. In the end, they are all bound by inherited thoughts. "They know how to reject shackles, but they dare not break the famous teachings." They become such sacrifices of the times. In the declining modern Chinese nation, our only hope is that young people like Chu Sheng will continue to increase. We even more hope that there will be people more powerful than Chu Sheng who can work hard to save women like Song Qing who can be awakened but have no courage, break the traditional and inherited ideas, "to conquer the heart is supreme, to conquer the city is secondary." Let us work hard, work hard to transform the national character.</p>
<p>A literary creation with a proper central idea can indeed be regarded as the first collection to discover this "unique banner and brand-new face," and it is naturally worthy of common appreciation. But because I love it so much, I am also critical of it. Please forgive me for contributing some opinions below.</p>
<p>National literature should be written in its own language and script. In this book, the author uses Western letters such as etc. to represent the names of the characters in the book. I think this should be absolutely avoided in national literary works. Moreover, the author uses this kind of pronoun inconsistently before and after. Since Lao Wang is X, Mr. Li is L, and Ziyu is T, then it should be straightforward to write Lao Wang, Mr. Li, and Ziyu. Why bother using X·L·T· to go around in circles in the above paragraphs? If the author thinks this contribution is conscious, then I hope the author will try to change it when it is reprinted.</p>

<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>The Changming Film Company declares that the new film "Fire Burning Pingyang City" in two episodes is meticulously produced and even better than the first episode. The first episode focuses on the change of photography, while the second episode retains the strange shooting method while striving for the continuity of the plot. This film has been showing at the Central Theater since the day before yesterday, and the box office is more prosperous than it has been since the theater entered the summer. Anyone who has seen this film cannot help but sigh that it is a rising star in domestic martial arts movies. This film is showing for the last day today at the Central Theater.</p>
<p>The Tongle Amusement Park on Nanjing Road declares that since the opening of the amusement park, it has strived for innovation. Today, the Peking Opera continues to perform two books of "Flying Dragon Biography." The mechanical scenery is quite novel. Every night, there is also a literary tiger waiting for instruction, so literati and elegant guests flock to it. The Baixing Grand Theater declares that since the Heyi Company took over the theater, it has paid more attention to film selection. The theater has already booked the second screening rights in Shanghai for the latest silent blockbusters released by Paramount, United Artists, Fox, and Metro. Therefore, the films shown are all famous. The film "Night Flower" showing today is the largest masterpiece starring the new movie queen, Baraigni Lai. It depicts the prosperity of the dance hall night market, the charming of the dancers, and the methods of seducing men. It is indeed charming and can satisfy the audience.</p>
