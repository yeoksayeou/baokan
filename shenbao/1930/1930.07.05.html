<h3 id="c69">歐洲聯邦運動 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>及其當前難關　　（駐歐特約通信記者化魯）　　（一）歐洲聯邦運動的起源　　歐洲是民族主義的發源地自從十八世紀末葉以來民族運動風靡一時每一個民族都保持着他們的語言宗敎文化都要求政治的獨立結果是把整個的歐洲大陸割裂成七零八落這種情形到了歐戰以後更爲顯著歐戰使俄德奥三大帝國瓦解産生了許多新國一九一四年歐洲不過二十五個獨立國現在增至三十五個獨立國和自由邦歐洲除了蘇維埃聯盟的領土以外總面積不過五百五十萬六公里人中不過三萬六千萬土地只有我國一半大人口還比我國少但中間却分裂成三打的國家這些國家土地有小到只數十方公里的人口有少到只數千的去年方成立的梵諦岡面積只比上海英租界的跑馬廳略大些人民只有一百四十餘個但也居然算是一個獨立國了　　民族主義運動雖然使歐洲許多弱小民族獲得了政治的獨立自由但同時却把歐洲分割的支離散漫大多數的國家因面積太小都缺乏防衛的能力事實上不免成了幾個大國的半保護國因此釀成幾個强國的合縱連衡影響到全部和平在經濟的方面困難更多歐洲各國工業原料及商貨市塲無不感到缺乏甲國所無的爲乙国國所有丙國所過乘的又爲丁國所缺少因爲各國互行關稅戰爭之故各國間設起重重的關稅壁壘凡爾賽和約的結果便使歐洲增加了二萬公里的關稅界缐因此商貨的流通非常困難工業品的銷售受重重的障碍假如拿歐洲和美國相比美國的面積人口大略和歐洲相仿但美國商品銷行全美四十八州不必納分文的稅餉反之在歐洲却須經過三十餘重稅關的剝削在這様情勢之下你想歐洲工業怎能和美國競爭呢所以就經濟的觀點來說歐洲不能不打破三十餘重的國界把全歐洲併成一個領域方能一方面保護本洲的工業市塲他方面和其他各洲相競爭　　再就政治上說歐洲國土分成七零八落各國都互相猜忌排擠永遠不能得到勢力的平衡在前世紀歐洲是靠着「均勢」以维持一時的和平所謂均勢就是靠了同盟條約把歐洲的許多國家分成甲乙兩方假如屬於甲方的國家的合併勢力和屬於乙方的國家的合併勢力差不多相等便暫時可以保持均衡這種政策直到二十世紀之初還是如此那時歐洲是在英法俄恊約與德奥意同盟的對抗狀態中維持着均勢的但到了大戰後這均勢完全破滅了軍事同盟的政策已被一般人所唾棄歐洲再不能結成合縱連衡的局面但此外靠了什麽東西來保障歐洲和平呢非戰公約保安公約仲裁條約究不過是紙上空文要是没有比較完全的國際組織歐洲各大國小國仍不免相互傾轢排擠着唯一的方法是只有把零星散漫的許多國家重來揉和在一起合成一個政治團體方能大家相安這就是歐洲聯邦運動的起因　　所以歐洲聯邦運動的意義在政治方面是謀替代舊式外交上的均勢政策和聯盟政策在經濟方面是在打通歐洲大陸的工業市塲打倒歐洲各國間的稅壁以期與别的大陸競爭此種運動不但爲改良派的社會民黨及一般和平主義者所贊成且亦爲歐洲大企業主金融資本家及自由貿易主義者所擁護尤其是近年以來歐洲工業金融受美國資本主義的威脅日甚一日歐洲聯邦論汎歐聯盟論以及全歐關稅同盟論更高唱一時如古丹荷甫喀萊琪所創立的汎歐同盟促成成（上月曾在柏林舉行大會各國名流到者甚多）便是一例但在以前活動的範圍還只限於人民輿論方面未經各國政府的正式提議直到去年九月法國外長白里安在日內瓦發表歐洲聯邦的建議今年五月法政府正式發表全歐聯盟的計畫書歐洲聯邦運動方纔由理想的而漸進於現實的雖然直到現在爲止此種大計畫還不過是紙上空文或者永遠成了紙上空文亦未可知但至少却是近時外交上値得注目的一個問題呢要聞</p>

<p>（一）合作運動是世界新經濟組織運動意在以合作社的組織來救濟現代專以營利爲目的之經濟組織的缺陷使由生産者與消費者雙方之聯絡以免除寄生階級的商人的漁利即生産者不致受其操縱與壓迫消費者亦不致被其榨取與宰割并以和平節儉公允自立與互助之方法來消除商業戰爭防止大企業獨佔調和勞資衝突絕滅高利貸借平允經濟利潤（二）合作運動可以團結民族精神因中國民族最大之缺陷即向來是散沙一盤故欲恢復民族固有之力量及提倡崇高的民族認識必先從團結人手從事合作事業即能獲得團結之利益而無形中養成一種自立互助同德同心同甘同苦之精神爲團結民族之一大幫助（三）合作運動可以促進民權之發逹因民權發逹必須從訓練入手故民權初步以爲」非集會不爲功」在合作社內「權」操於社員之手而「能」則由社員選舉專員負責及合作社的「一人一票權」制實具有民主的精神其情形正與國家之權能分立相同故由合作社內工作之練習可爲選舉罷免創制複决四權行使之訓練而爲促成民權主義實現之良法（四）合作運動是實現民生主義的第一步合作運動之目的在以人民自養爲目的非如資本主義之營利爲目的并以一定之計劃以建成一個平等公允養民而有意識之經濟組織其目的與民生主義相同惟民生主義挾有政治的力量是以法律的制度來抑制地主與資本家之操縱及保護農民及勞動者之權利合作運動則純爲人民自身之努力單爲經濟方面之組織方法略有不同但惟其如此由合作運動努力所得之人民自身之經濟力量可爲政治力量之輔助而促成民生主義之成功故合作運動是實現民生主義之第一步而合作運動亦須在民生主義推行之下才得成功是使合作民生主義化非民生主義合作化（五）合作運動是樹立地方自治的基礎因地方自治是地方人民自已管理自已之政治與經濟的組織由合作事業之經騐可養成自助自立自衛之觀念亦即可養成自治之根基故總理在地方自治實行法中即有自治機關應提倡合作事業之規定今當籌備地方自治聲中尤應提倡合作運動以期彼此提挈推進（六）合作運動可以解除農民之痛苦中國農民佔全國人口百分之八十以上除因貨借困難影響及於日常生活艱苦外最受痛苦的是在耕者不能有其田故總理平均地權之中除制定法律以限制保護及獎勵外仍有扶助農民購買土地使能「耕者有其田」之規定合作社之功用即能以聯絡恊作精神（一）應用消費合作社使農民能從生産者或批發者直接購買日用必需品免聊被商人一轉手獲得之漁利而節省日常費用（二）應用供給合作社使農民能共同購買肥料種子及工具以增進技術的效能而增加生産的力量（三）應用販賣合作社使農民能直接販賣以免商人從中剝削與操縱以增加生産的價格（四）應用製造合作社可使農民共同製造必須以機器製造的農産品如酪乳之類以增加日常之收入（五）應用信用合作社以流通資産使農民得改善日常之生活並能獲得資本進而購買土地而使耕者有其田（七）合作運動是解放工人及小商人的運動因工人变同受缺少資本的痛苦致使最低生活亦幾無法維持故總理對於工人救濟方面是規定最高限和最低限的工資制定工廠管理法確定勞動保險制採用分潤制等方法以資救濟但凡此皆是法律的規定與同等的援助若能從事合作運動各人自身努力求解放其成效則必能更速因由生産合作社可使工人成爲工廠機器及一切生産工具的共有人由建築合作社可使工人得成爲房産共有人由消費合作社可使工人得以改善日常生活外並得成爲社中股東及儲蓄的共有人其他如城市之小商人其受經濟組織不良之痛苦亦不亞於農工故亦可組織合作社使不受大商店的壓迫減少進貨之成本而能多生資本以改善其生活　　標語口號（一）合作運動是實現民生主義的第一步（二）合作運動是解决吾國經濟問題的武器（三）合作運動是發展平民經濟的運動（四）合作運動可以製造資本（五）合作運動可以節制資本（六）合作運動可使耕者有其田（七）合作運動可以樹立地方自治的基礎（八）合作運動可以袪除社會的浪費（九）合作社是平民的銀行（十）合作社可以免除高利貸金的痛苦（十）（一）合作社可以使物價低廉（十）（二）合作可以防止大企業的獨佔（十）（三）合作可以養成良好的道德（十）（四）合作可以養成勤儉的習慣（十）（五）合作可以改良農工的生活（十）（六）合作可以促進生産的發展（十）（七）合作是「人人爲我我爲人人」（十）（八）全國民衆一致起來參加合作運動　　中國國民黨上海特别市黨部宣傳部岌岌可危</p>

<h3 id="e7">The Struggle Between the Left and Right Wings <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The phenomenon of economic and political unrest in the world is becoming increasingly apparent today. Regarding the economy, issues such as unemployment and strikes have made it impossible for governments to deal with them, and they are in a predicament from which they cannot extricate themselves. Regarding politics, there is also a point of mutual stimulation that makes the political situation equally unstable, namely the competition between the left and right wings of political parties. Taking recent news as an example, in Germany, the activities of the National Socialist Party and the demonstrations of the extreme youth party have caused domestic unrest. In Finland, the government has been reorganized due to the overwhelming pressure of the anti-communist movement. In Poland, a large number of arrests have been made due to the organization of an opposition party congress by members of parliament to conspire to undermine security, and riots have broken out throughout the country. In Switzerland, a major disturbance occurred in parliament due to a conflict between members of the proletarian party and members of the Catholic Church. There are many similar news stories from other countries. As a result, the trend of extreme mutual attacks between the left and right parties and the resulting other problems has also been heard from time to time. If the strength of the left and right parties are equal, they will continue to attack each other. Although the parliament is not peaceful, the government can still rely on this to balance the situation and maintain a precarious balance. Once the left wins, the left wing rises up to form a cabinet and the right falls. If the right wins, the right wing rises up to form a cabinet and the left falls. A few years ago, the rise and fall of the left and right parties would only occur once every few years. Now, the rise and fall are becoming more frequent, even several times a year. The political situation is becoming more and more unstable. However, in terms of the general trend of the world, this struggle between the left and right parties must have a final victory or defeat one day. The revolving rise-and-fall situation will only be settled when the final overall victory or defeat is determined. It is not known how much more chaos will be seen before this occurs.

<p>German Foreign Minister's Statement</p>
<p>A New Era Has Begun in Foreign Policy</p>
<p>Germany is Determined to Fulfill All Debts</p>
<p>The German Foreign Minister Curtius gave a speech in the Reichstag on foreign policy, refuting the idea that Germany had a vengeful desire after the Rhine withdrawal, saying that after the foreign troops were withdrawn from the Rhine, Germany's most urgent work was completed, and its foreign policy had entered a new era with a better international atmosphere. Its basis and principles are to strive for complete freedom and equality for Germany in the political field, and to promote international understanding and fully develop the country's important interests, without forgetting to consolidate peace and taking it as its supreme goal. All these ideas are in line with the greatest interests of Europe. Therefore, Germany's interests are the interests of Europe. This is why Germany is in a happy position today. If there is a division among European countries in the future, Germany will always be on the side of progress and equality. He then solemnly declared that Germany is determined to fulfill all its debts and believes that the former Allied countries will also fulfill their promises to resolve the post-war pending issues, such as the Franco-German Saar negotiations, and the League of Nations, which he deeply regrets for its failure to fully apply the principle of equality in disarmament, economic cooperation, protection of minorities, and other important issues, which has been criticized by the world. Finally, he discussed Briand's federal plan and declared that Germany would support any plan that would consolidate the countries of Europe. Unfortunately, there are still many obstacles to the implementation of Briand's plan.</p>

In the future, the cooperative system should be promoted throughout the country to abolish the landlord class. Finally, the opposing members of the right wing should be severely punished.</p>

<p>Paul Haenlein</p>
<p>Germans Plan to Erect a Monument</p>
<p>Telecommunications Agency, Berlin Correspondence: Since the airship Zeppelin traveled around the world in a week, the name of Germany has spread to all countries. The German people, who are well versed in history, regard Captain Eckener as a national treasure and at the same time do not forget the great achievements of the late Count Zeppelin and Paul Haenlein. Outsiders do not know who Paul Haenlein is. Even among the Germans, 99 out of 100 people do not know his name, but this person is the inventor of the airship. He installed a propeller engine on a leaf-shaped balloon to make it an aircraft. From Haenlein's point of view, Count Zeppelin was his technical son, and Dr. Eckener was his technical grandson. Count Zeppelin mentioned this in a letter to his friend in 1914, the year the World War broke out. The letter also stated that he planned to erect a monument to this great inventor who changed the era of light balloons to the era of airships. Haenlein was born in Mainz in 1835 and died in 1905. He improved the light balloon so that it did not resist wind force and installed a propeller engine on the balloon at the age of 33. After four years of hard research, he manufactured the world's first rigid airship, 50 meters long and wide, soaring over Mainz. He then offered it to the Prussian army, but it was rejected as unsuitable for military use. He was forced to go to Vienna to obtain the assistance of the Austrian royal family to continue his research and production. He suffered from a lack of funds and went to Switzerland. At that time, the fuel he used was lighting gas. He planned to use it as fuel for warships and use the profits he earned as research funds. He moved to the river bank to study this matter and died of illness in 1905. This matter has recently become known to the German people, who plan to build a monument or commemorate his great achievements in other appropriate ways. The location is either his birthplace or Friedrichshafen, which is named after the airship, but it has not yet been decided.</p>

Therefore, the split of the National Socialist Party will be faster than expected. Twenty-five leaders and staff members of the party in Berlin have issued a declaration announcing their secession from the party and the organization of the National Revolutionary Labor Party, and denounced the National Socialist Party for failing to faithfully abide by the party program originally set, such as rejecting the imperialist claims, opposing the war with Soviet Russia, supporting India and its anti-imperialist revolutionaries, overthrowing the capitalist government, creating a socialist state, and refusing to cooperate with various capitalist factions. They deeply believe that the tens of thousands of workers who follow the party will also declare their secession and continue to abide by the aforementioned party program and fight for the complete national revolution.</p>

<p>At a Time of Crisis</p>
<p>Do Not Misjudge the Countermeasures</p>
<p>Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, 4th: When the government opened the Industrial Rationalization Bureau, it invited business leaders from the east and west to a discussion meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence yesterday afternoon. Those present included representatives from the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, representatives from various industries, members of the Industrial Council, personnel from the Industrial Rationalization Bureau, Prime Minister Hamaguchi, and Minister of Commerce Tawar. First, Prime Minister Hamaguchi gave a speech, saying that in order to overcome the current economic difficulties and overcome the economic crisis, there is no better way than to rationalize the industry and change the foundation. He hopes for the efforts of the Rationalization Bureau. Then, Motoyoshi Naka, an advisor to the Rationalization Bureau, and Takuma Dan, gave speeches, saying that in order to achieve the great goal of rationalization, officials and the public must work together and hope that everyone will cooperate. Next, the discussion meeting was changed. Yoshio Sakatani warned the government with a tragic face, and the atmosphere at the meeting suddenly became tense. The general idea was that, theoretically speaking, industrial rationalization is indeed a legitimate move, but the current economic world is not effective enough to be rationalized. How to overcome the current economic difficulties that are imminent at the end of this year, and how to remedy them, is a matter of great concern to me. If this is the case, I hope that the extraordinary means of issuing an emergency decree will not be used sparingly. The government has not adopted the sources of taxation laws and labor union laws that the business community hopes for, and is simply shouting about rationalizing and killing the business community. How can it be expected to revitalize the business community? I absolutely cannot agree with this kind of rationalization. I hope that the government officials will consider the overall situation and not misjudge the countermeasures in this crisis. Next, Keizaburo Hashimoto gave a speech, saying that in this difficult situation, although there are many discussions, they are useless. It is better to quickly talk about emergency countermeasures. Although the financial world has encountered this great recession, the United States has responded to the situation and is proceeding with appropriate countermeasures. Japan should also follow Hoover's example and make elastic rationalization. He implicitly satirized and criticized the Minister of Finance's inaction and criticized the government's theoretical rationalization policy. Finally, Minister of Commerce Tawar gave his views, saying that vertical rationalization is underway, and horizontal rationalization is competition among the same industry. There is currently no restriction on this point. It is hoped that officials and the public will cooperate to avoid unreasonable competition in order to prevent everyone from perishing together. The meeting ended at 4 pm in tension.</p>

The government has agreed to let Russel go on vacation till September and though Russel has to return to Haiti after the vacation, it will be a temporary arrangement and once the new president of Haiti is selected, the full power of the US in Haiti will be handed over to the US minister, Munro.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 3rd: The first result of the Labour Party's cooperation with the Liberal Party to relieve unemployment will be seen in the emergency legislation to be introduced next week. The legislation will expedite the legislative procedures for remedial unemployment programs. It is expected that the government will ask the House of Commons for some funds to be used for relief work in the necessary areas, and the Liberal Party's proposal for a large public works loan will be seriously considered. The current parliamentary session may therefore have to be extended beyond mid-August, while members of Parliament's summer vacation will be shortened.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Tin Mines Temporarily Suspend Mining <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>(Special Correspondence from Nanyang, Xiao Hui)</p>
<p>Suspension Date Must Not Be Less Than Two Months</p>
<p>Miner Unemployment Has Become a Major Problem</p>
<p>The period of one month of rubber tapping suspension has just ended, and the news of tin mine suspension has risen again. Rubber and tin are two important factors that determine the prosperity and decline of Nanyang, and they are of great concern to those who are in the tin industry, as well as those who are concerned about labor issues and social security. Since various tin trading companies in Sydney, Australia, proposed a three-month suspension plan, people in the tin industry have been shocked and concerned, and those concerned about labor issues and social security have also regarded it as a major hidden concern. The sales of tin are the highest in the United States and Britain. Now the production of tin is increasing day by day, but the consumption of tin has not increased. As a result, the production volume has formed a surplus, and the price has plummeted. Malayan tin mining companies have recently used water trucks for mining, and the production of tin is increasing. The production volume in May was 10,074 tons, while the world's consumption of tin is only 10,000 tons per month. Therefore, the tin produced by various tin mines in Malaya every month is sufficient for the world's use. In addition, the unlimited production of Australia has caused the supply and demand to lose balance. The current stock of tin has reached more than 40,100 tons. Since the stock of tin cannot be sold and new tin is coming in continuously, the price of tin has fallen step by step from 420 pounds (the highest price) to 132 pounds, 10 shillings and 2 pence (the current lowest price). It is unprecedented. If the market conditions are like this, all tin operators are running around in panic, trying every possible means to seek a slight turnaround. This is the origin of the saying of suspending production to save high prices. On June 14, the Malayan Four State Mining Association held a special general meeting in Ipoh. All participants were famous miners in Malaya, about 60 in number. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Ridge, the chairman of the Mining Association. After a long discussion on whether suspending the production of tin could save the market price, it was decided that the suspension date should not be less than two months, and the Mining Association requested the government to stipulate that tin mining should work six days a week, that is, one day off per week. As for when the suspension date will start, because there is no certainty about how to arrange the workers after the suspension, the Mining Association plans to convene another meeting and will announce it as soon as a definite solution is obtained. From this point of view, the suspension of tin mines is inevitable. It is difficult to predict what the effect will be after the suspension, but the two major problems that need to be solved urgently at present are relieving unemployment and maintaining social order. The problem of unemployment has spread to countries all over the world. Since the price of rubber and tin has fallen in Nanyang, unemployment panic has filled the minds of people from all countries. In addition, if tin mines are suspended, how will the more than 100,000 miners be resettled? The local government is considering the issue of relieving unemployment. It is reported that two methods have been proposed. One is to send Chinese workers back to their country, but this is not a consistent policy of the Malay Federal Government. The second is to build roads. There is a certain plan within the Malay Federation every year to develop its road administration, which requires a lot of workers. The Malay government may take this opportunity to try to resettle a large number of workers to engage in road construction. In the future, the government and the miners will jointly maintain unemployment. It is not known whether Jin Dabu's Chinese businessmen's tin mining company will participate in the suspension, so the number of unemployed miners can be reduced. As for the issue of maintaining social order, due to the serious problem of unemployment, it is rumored that someone has requested the government to temporarily prohibit the entry of Chinese tin workers. It is not known whether this is true or not, but in order to prevent bandits, the police in Ipoh have implemented martial law, and patrol teams are dispatched to patrol the city's borders and important areas every night. The night entrance to the city is under strict surveillance, and the situation is generally serious.</p>
<h3 id="e69">European Federation Movement <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>And its Current Difficulties (Special Correspondent in Europe, Hua Lu) (1) Origin of the European Federation Movement Europe is the birthplace of nationalism. Since the end of the eighteenth century, the nationalist movement has been extremely popular. Each nation maintains its language, religion, and culture, and demands political independence. As a result, the entire European continent has been divided into scattered pieces. This situation became more pronounced after the European War. The European War led to the collapse of the Russian, German, and Austro-Hungarian empires, giving rise to many new countries. In 1914, Europe had only twenty-five independent countries; now, it has increased to thirty-five independent countries and free states. Except for the territory of the Soviet Union, the total area of Europe is only 5.506 million square kilometers, with a population of only 360 million. Its land area is only half the size of China, and its population is even smaller than China's, but it is divided into three dozen countries. Some of these countries are as small as only dozens of square kilometers, and some have populations as small as only thousands. The Vatican, which was established last year, has an area only slightly larger than the Shanghai British Concession's racecourse, and a population of only 140-odd people, but it is still considered an independent country. Although the nationalist movement has enabled many small and weak nations in Europe to gain political independence and freedom, it has also divided Europe into scattered pieces. Most countries are too small and lack defense capabilities. In fact, they inevitably become semi-protectorates of several major powers, which leads to the formation of alliances among several strong countries, affecting overall peace. In terms of economy, there are even more difficulties. All European countries feel a lack of industrial raw materials and commercial markets. What one country lacks is possessed by another, and what one country has in excess is lacking by another. Because countries impose tariffs on each other, heavy tariff barriers are set up between them. The result of the Treaty of Versailles was to add 20,000 kilometers of tariff boundaries to Europe, making the circulation of goods very difficult and hindering the sales of industrial products. If we compare Europe with the United States, the area and population of the United States are roughly the same as those of Europe, but American goods can be sold throughout the forty-eight states of the United States without paying a single tax. In contrast, in Europe, they must go through more than thirty tax barriers. Under such circumstances, how can European industry compete with the United States? Therefore, from an economic point of view, Europe must break down the thirty-odd national borders and merge the whole of Europe into one territory in order to protect the industrial market of the continent on the one hand and compete with other continents on the other. Furthermore, politically speaking, Europe is divided into scattered pieces, and each country is suspicious and exclusive of the other, making it impossible to achieve a balance of power. In the past century, Europe relied on a "balance of power" to maintain temporary peace. The so-called balance of power relied on alliance treaties to divide the many countries of Europe into two sides, A and B. If the combined strength of the countries belonging to side A was roughly equal to the combined strength of the countries belonging to side B, then a balance could be maintained temporarily. This policy continued until the beginning of the twentieth century. At that time, Europe maintained a balance of power in the confrontation between the Entente of Britain, France, and Russia and the alliance of Germany, Austria, and Italy. But after the Great War, this balance of power was completely shattered. The policy of military alliances has been generally rejected by people. Europe can no longer form an alliance situation. But what else can be relied upon to ensure peace in Europe? The Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Security Pact, and arbitration treaties are nothing more than empty words on paper. Without a relatively complete international organization, the major and small countries of Europe will inevitably continue to oppress and exclude each other. The only way is to reorganize the many scattered countries and form a political entity so that everyone can live in peace. This is the origin of the European Federation Movement. Therefore, the significance of the European Federation Movement in the political aspect is to seek to replace the old-style balance of power policy and alliance policy in diplomacy. In the economic aspect, it is to open up the industrial market of the European continent and eliminate the tax barriers between European countries in order to compete with other continents. This movement is not only supported by the reformist social democratic parties and general pacifists, but also by European large-scale business owners, financial capitalists, and free trade advocates. Especially in recent years, as European industry and finance have been increasingly threatened by American capitalism, the theory of European Federation, the theory of Pan-European Union, and the theory of a pan-European customs union have been even more loudly proclaimed. For example, the Pan-European Union founded by Coudenhove-Kalergi has been promoting the establishment (a conference was held in Berlin last month, attended by many celebrities from various countries). But in the past, the scope of activity was limited to public opinion and had not been formally proposed by the governments of various countries. It was not until September last year that French Foreign Minister Briand made a proposal for a European Federation in Geneva, and in May this year, the French government officially published a plan for a pan-European alliance that the European Federation Movement gradually moved from the ideal to reality. Although this grand plan is still just empty words on paper, or may forever become empty words on paper, it is at least a noteworthy issue in recent diplomacy. News</p>

<h3 id="e70">Zhang Guizhou's Army in a Desperate Situation in Southern Hunan <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The Eighth Route Army Strictly Prevents Escape to Guangdong Guangzhou Correspondence After the vanguard units of the Eighth Route Army, the three divisions of Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, and Li Yangjing, arrived in Hengyang, Zhang Guizhou's army retreated south from Liling via Youxian. Gui's army, led by Huang Shaoxiong, also moved from Changning via Leiyang. At that time, the two brigades of Huang Renhuan and Mao Weishou, which had entered Hunan from Guangdong in the second batch, were afraid that the 10,000-strong enemy entrenched in Leiyang would attempt to encroach on the Guangdong border. Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route Army, also considered the situation in southern Hunan to be serious and ordered the two brigades of Huang and Mao to cease their advance into Hunan. Furthermore, due to the emptiness of Shaoguan's defenses, the Yu Hanmou division stationed in Wuzhou was transferred to northern Guangdong to strengthen the defensive works at the key fortresses of Maozifeng and Lianhuagang outside Shaoguan city. The Shaoguan branch of the Central Bank, in order to prevent any eventuality, transported the cash and banknotes stored in the bank back to the Guangzhou headquarters for storage on the 26th. The Li Zhenqiu brigade of the Yu Hanmou division stationed in Wuzhou also gradually transferred to Shaoguan on the 27th to await orders. Because the war in southern Hunan was still raging on the 25th, until recently, Zhang Guizhou's army again moved south with all its forces in Youxian. According to an air reconnaissance report on the 27th, the two divisions of Jiang and Cai of the Eighth Route Army had engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy in the northwest of Leiyang on the 25th and were still in contact on the 26th. According to headquarters news, the enemy gathered on the east bank of the Xiang River to attack Hengyang was composed of three regiments of Zhang Fakui's army and Li Zongren's guard regiment. On the 25th, the group launched several assaults on Hengyang, suffering over a thousand casualties. The enemy at Songbai (approximately 80 miles southwest of Hengyang) and Jiangkoutang was in contact with the sentries of the Eighth Route Army's Jiang division in Hengzhou, but had not advanced and reportedly showed signs of retreating towards Changning. In the Youxian area, the four-route army of He Jian had occupied Anren, etc. Finally, news was received from the 63rd Division at the front that the enemy had gathered over 10,000 men on the 25th and 26th to encircle and attack our army. After our army counterattacked and fought a bloody battle for an entire day and night, the enemy was unsuccessful and fled towards Changning and Chenzhou at night. Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route Army, immediately ordered the two brigades of Mao Weishou and Huang Renhuan, as well as the Chen Hanguang regiment of the guard, to strictly deploy defenses in the areas of Lechang, Pingshi, and Jiufeng in order to consolidate the Guangdong border, and also transferred the 59th Division, the Yu Hanmou division, from Shaoguan to Lechang for defense. It is now ascertained that Zhang Guizhou's army is retreating south in two groups. Huang Shaoxiong's group appears to be leaving Xintian via Chenzhou to attack Pingshi, while Zhang Fakui's group is taking the road from eastern Hunan to Jiangxi, with the intention of cutting into southern Jiangxi via Lianhua. Therefore, Guangdong is making very thorough border defenses. (June 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Han-Japanese Residents' Road Construction Case Over the Border <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Consul States No Intention of Encroaching on Sovereignty The Municipal Government Replies to the Japanese Consul Expressing Understanding Hankou Correspondence The Hankou Municipal Government sent a letter to the Japanese consul requesting that he stop the Japanese residents' group from building Yongqing Road over the border. The government also sent Health Bureau Director Li Boren to negotiate. On the first of this month, Japanese Consul Tanaka replied to the Municipal Government, officially stating that there was no intention of encroaching on Chinese territory and sovereignty and requesting understanding to allow the completion of the project. The Municipal Government has replied in the affirmative and has informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for record and has also instructed the Public Security Bureau and the Public Works Bureau. The relevant documents are excerpted below. The Japanese Consul's Reply to the Municipal Government In regards to the matter of the local Japanese residents' group slightly repairing Yongqing Road, we have received your government's letter Zhi Zi No. 1602 detailing the circumstances. However, this road is the only road connecting the Japanese concession to the Japanese park, and many Japanese people travel on this road. Moreover, due to the current summer season, even more people are entering and leaving the park, and the road is severely damaged, causing inconvenience to traffic. Therefore, the residents' group is bearing the cost of slightly repairing the road for the convenience of general traffic. If it does not rain, it is expected that the project can be completed within three or four days. However, in order to protect the repair project, we request that the police force directly responsible for the road, namely the Sanyuanli Police Station of your country, provide protection. This is a temporary and emergency measure for the convenience of traffic between Japanese and Chinese people. Therefore, our side has no opinion regarding the ownership of the roadbed or the police power on the road, and there is no intention to engage in any major actions that would infringe on sovereignty. We trust that your country will fully understand this and kindly reply to this letter after reviewing it. The Municipal Government's Reply to the Japanese Consul We have received your letter regarding the repair of Yongqing Road, stating that it is a temporary and emergency measure for the convenience of traffic and that it does not involve the ownership of the roadbed or the police power on the road, and that there is no intention to engage in any major actions that would infringe on sovereignty. After reviewing it, our mayor fully understands. However, according to the regulations for the construction and repair of roads in this city, the Public Works Bureau must approve the project before construction can begin. Since the letter states that the project is minor and is expected to be completed within three or four days, we can make an exception and allow the repair. In addition to informing the Public Works Bureau for record, we hereby reply to this letter for your information. The Municipal Government's Letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Regarding Request for Record Regarding the matter of requesting a record, our government received a report from the Public Security Bureau, which was forwarded from the 13th Police Station, stating that at 10:00 AM on the 5th of this month, they received a telephone call from the Japanese patrol station stating that the Construction Bureau of the Consulate General of Japan intended to repair the section of the road from the railway to the Japanese park, namely Yongqing Road, and requested that the police officers be instructed to protect all the materials and workers. Yongqing Road is within the jurisdiction of the 13th Police Station. The dispatch of personnel by the Japanese Construction Bureau for repairs is an act of encroachment over the border. Should it be stopped? Please review and instruct. After investigation, this case involves land issues, and an investigation by the Finance Bureau revealed that Yongqing Road is a public road and is not connected to the Japanese concession. The dispatch of workers by the Japanese Construction Bureau for repairs is indeed an act of encroachment over the border. The Public Security Bureau was instructed to reply by telephone to stop the project. The Bureau subsequently reported that the Japanese patrol station claimed that the repair of Yongqing Road was being handled by our residents' group and that they would reply after notifying the residents' group. If the Chinese Construction Bureau wishes to repair the road, please contact the residents' group directly. Please conduct a serious negotiation to demonstrate prudence. Our government sternly rejected this and sent Health Bureau Director Li Boren to the Japanese Consulate General to negotiate in person, requesting that the patrol station be instructed to stop work immediately. We have now received a reply from the Japanese Consul stating that the repair of the road is for the convenience of traffic and that it does not involve the ownership of the roadbed, police power, or sovereignty, and requesting understanding. In addition to replying to the letter temporarily approving the repair and instructing the Public Works Bureau and the Public Security Bureau, we are sending a copy of the circumstances and the four official letters exchanged between our government and the Japanese Consulate General to your ministry for record. Order to the Public Works Bureau and the Public Security Bureau (1) Order to the Public Works Bureau Regarding the Case for Information Our Bureau previously received a report from the Public Security Bureau, which was forwarded from the 13th Police Station (same as the letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs). In addition to replying to the letter temporarily approving the repair and instructing the Public Security Bureau to inform the Ministry for record, we are sending a copy of the original three letters to your bureau for information. (2) Order to the Public Security Bureau Regarding the Case for Information Regarding the case of Japanese encroachment over the border for road repair, your bureau previously submitted a report detailing the circumstances and requesting instructions, which our bureau sternly rejected and sent Health Bureau Director Li Boren to negotiate in person, requesting that the patrol station be instructed to stop work immediately. We have now received a reply from the Japanese Consul stating that the repair of the road is for the convenience of traffic and that it does not involve the ownership of the roadbed, police power, or sovereignty, and requesting understanding. In addition to replying to the letter temporarily approving the repair and informing the Ministry for record, we hereby instruct your bureau for information. (July 1st) Japanese Sakakibara</p>
<h3 id="e72">Encroachment on Official and Private Land in Liaoning Province <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence Sakakibara, a Japanese national who leases and operates a farm near the North Tomb in Shenyang, has repeatedly encroached on land outside the farm's boundaries. Negotiations have occurred more than once, and each time Sakakibara has made excuses. A month ago, the Japanese national even demolished a branch line of the Beining Railway, arousing public anger among our people. Serious negotiations were conducted with him, but the case remains unresolved to this day. Recently, it has been discovered that the farm has encroached on official and private land in two instances. (1) A section of official land is located north of the Xin Kaihe Wooden Bridge in front of the North Tomb, on the west side of the road leading to the Beining Railway Station, and north of the road, bordering the rice paddies cultivated by Sakakibara's farm. Sakakibara has erected barbed wire along the east side of the road, 10 zhang and 5 chi in length from north to south, and 8 zhang and 3 chi in width from east to west. Inside the barbed wire, he has erected wooden signs stating that it is construction land for the Sakakibara Farm Office. The Shenyang Municipal Public Office has sent personnel to investigate and confirmed that Sakakibara has not submitted an application for construction to the office and that he is indeed encroaching on official land outside the farm's boundaries. The matter has been reported to the Liaoning Provincial Government and a letter has been sent to the Commissioner of Foreign Affairs Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to initiate negotiations with the Japanese Consulate. (2) Farmer Wang Danian of the Dabeibianmen outside Shenyang, at the Shenhai Road Market, reported in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China that he had registered 61 mu and 6 fen of land in the restricted wilderness of Zhaoling, located northwest of the Provincial Third Middle School of the North Tomb. He has a deed, with the eastern boundary being Xiang Zizhong's land, the western boundary being the road, the southern boundary being Li Shuzheng's land, and the northern boundary being the paddy fields cultivated by Sakakibara's farm. The two sides are separated by a natural ditch. Zhang Guobin, a surveyor of the Land Survey Bureau, measured and released the land multiple times, and the mu count and boundaries were clearly established. At that time, special care was taken regarding the boundary issue because it was adjacent to Sakakibara's leased land. Subsequently, the land was leased for vegetable cultivation for four years, and everything was peaceful. Last summer, Sakakibara suddenly claimed that Wang Danian had encroached on his land. Wang Danian refuted the claim with reason, and the Japanese national retreated due to the weakness of his argument. Recently, Sakakibara has suddenly sent people to Wang Danian to claim encroachment and threaten to remove the seedlings if he does not return the land. Wang Danian has now petitioned the government to negotiate based on reason to protect civilian property and national territory. (27th)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Recent News from Qingdao <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Cooperation in Maintaining Public Order After the changes in Jinan, rumors flourished in the city. Mayor Ge Jingen originally planned to resign and return south, but because the new mayor Hu Ruoyu has not yet been able to arrive in Qingdao and the current situation in the city is unstable, coupled with the fact that the local residents are a mix of Chinese and foreigners, he decided to temporarily postpone his southern trip and bear the responsibility for maintaining public order in the city. He ordered the Public Security Bureau's Security Brigade to patrol in shifts every night, and tasked the Detective Brigade with increasing its duties and conducting investigations at any time. Naval Commander Shen Honglie and Fleet Commander Ling Xiao also considered the city's public order to be related to international relations and ordered the marine corps to patrol the streets every night to provide deterrence. As a result, the situation in the city has been very quiet in recent days. General Outline of the Provincial Government's Office After Commander-in-Chief Han withdrew from Jinan, the members of the Shandong Provincial Government came to Qingdao together and temporarily borrowed the Qingdao University to organize a temporary provincial government office in order to maintain the provincial government. The office has now been established and is divided into two departments: the Document Department, which is responsible for drafting documents and receiving and sending official documents, and the Administrative Department, which is responsible for general affairs, accounting, telecommunications, and seal management. It is reported that the National Government and the Executive Yuan have telegraphed their approval for the provincial committee to temporarily establish an office in Qingdao to perform their duties. The Municipal Government's Diplomatic Receptions After the news of Commander-in-Chief Han's withdrawal from Jinan spread, the consuls of various countries paid close attention to the city's public order and went to the Municipal Government to inquire about the situation. Chief of the Third Section Wu Zifeng reported to the consuls of various countries in the past few days and stated that Mayor Ge would not be traveling south for the time being and would be fully responsible for the city's public order, and that all foreigners in Qingdao would be given extra protection. The consuls all expressed satisfaction. Recent Situation in Jinan After Commander-in-Chief Han left Jinan, Feng Pengzhu's Ninth Army and Gao Hongwen's 26th Division of the Jin Army entered Jinan at noon on the 25th. Li Fuying's Fifth Army also crossed the river in succession. On the 27th, Shi Yousan's Shandong Provincial Government moved from Dezhou to Jinan. Chuan Zuoyi also arrived in Jinan from Changqing with Chief of Staff Chen Bingqian, Director of the Staff Department He Chengpu, and others. With the heads of the factions gathered, they appointed personnel within their respective spheres of influence. As a result, the same agency and the same position had as many as three or four principal officials appointed by different parties at the same time, creating chaos in the administrative aspect. Commander-in-Chief Han, after arriving in Zhoucun on the 25th, immediately set up defenses and contacted Liu Zhennian's troops. As soon as the arrangements were completed, he ordered a counterattack. Transportation Along the Jiaoji Railway For several days, the Jiaoji Railway has been unable to maintain its original schedule due to the military situation in Jinan. Currently, the trains departing from Qingdao only reach Fangzi, and those departing from Jinan only stop at Zhangdian and above. However, in addition to the railway security team protecting the trains, police officers are dispatched along the entire line to patrol, so there is no change in the order along the entire Jiaoji Railway, and all passengers can travel safely.</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Situation of the Northeast Flour Industry <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence Before the tenth year of the Republic of China, there were as many as 28 flour factories in Harbin, and their sales reached Pingjin, Zhilu, and North Manchuria. The flour made from wheat produced in North Manchuria was unparalleled in color, aroma, and taste. After the twelfth year of the Republic of China, due to the strike at the Harbin Exchange, the market price of wheat temporarily rose from more than one yuan to more than three yuan, and the price of flour followed suit. American flour took the opportunity to enter the market. Later, when the turmoil subsided, American flour had already occupied the Liaoning area, and local flour lost a portion of its sales. Since then, the sales of the flour industry have been declining and have not recovered in recent years. Recently, Japanese nationals have taken advantage of the implementation of the new Sino-Japanese tariff treaty, utilizing the mutual benefit of tariffs to guarantee convenient transportation, and have begun purchasing our raw materials and setting up factories to manufacture flour, which they then import back into our country. They also receive additional tariff exemptions and low freight rates from the Japanese government. As a result, Japanese flour is steadily entering the four northeastern provinces and competing with our local products at low prices. The flour industry in the three provinces has suffered another blow, and many businesses have closed one after another. The twelve businesses that are still operating are only those with relatively strong capital. These twelve businesses produce approximately 63-64 train cars of flour per day, and local sales are only 15-16 cars per day. The remainder is transported to various towns along the Eastern Railway. Faced with this crisis, the flour industry in the Northeast is aware that if they do not take immediate action to save the situation, they will all be doomed. Therefore, the Flour Mill Association of the Three Provinces has initiated a plan to unite as a whole for common development and to research new methods to improve manufacturing. On the one hand, they are requesting the provincial government to take measures to maintain the industry to avoid mutual destruction. Currently, 43 operating flour mills in the three provinces have unanimously joined the organization and will be organizing in Harbin in mid-July in order to pool their efforts and strive to save the industry.

Opening of the Grain Price Stabilization Program This year's grain price stabilization program in Jiading will follow the old practice of purchasing and transporting Xian rice with accumulated grain funds and distributing it to various districts in three phases for sale at a price of twelve yuan per dan. The price is calculated in terms of Feng Hu. After the rice is sold, the funds will be turned over for storage, and losses and transportation costs will be used for regular expenses. After the districts receive the rice, they will distribute it according to the previously established charts, with the price set at 230 wen per jin. Only poor households are eligible to purchase the rice, and the number of people per household is determined by the number of poor households in each chart. The program is expected to be completed within one month if the weather is clear (if the rain stops and the rice is received).</p>

The county government had previously sent a letter stating that the rice businesses in Songjiang City had abundant rice reserves. It specially summoned rice industry leaders to advise on price stabilization to maintain food supplies for the people. Representatives of the industry held a meeting yesterday to discuss and resolve that, since the price of mixed rice has been gradually increasing since the beginning of spring, our industry bears the responsibility of regulating the people's food supply and should make a slight contribution to alleviate the situation. The eastern section will be organized by Zhang Sheng-san to collect rice and distribute it to the poor. The western section will follow established precedents and raise funds to organize a low-priced rice distribution point to help the poor, with Zhang Zhi-shi and Ye Ying-chun as directors.

<p>Violent winds and rain capsize stone boat. The weather has been sultry recently, with thunderstorms occurring almost every afternoon. Yesterday afternoon at around 6:00 PM, dark clouds suddenly gathered, and thunder rumbled, followed by torrential rain. Two stone boats in Taihu Lake capsized near Yuantouzhu. Fortunately, the boatmen were all good swimmers and did not become victims of the waves.

Li Quangen (41 years old), a resident outside the north gate of Wuxi, used to work in the mountain goods industry, but he squandered his income at will. Recently, he quit his job and spent his days wandering around. Yesterday morning, he secretly went home and forced his father, Li Jingsheng (62 years old), to sell the ancestral property that had already been pawned. Jingsheng refused, and Quangen became furious, grabbing his father and dragging him to a nearby bridge, where he threw him into the river to drown. Fortunately, Ling Shunqing, a police officer on duty at the fifth branch of the Public Security Bureau, saw this and intervened, taking them both to the bureau and transferring them to the Public Security Bureau in the afternoon.

Cured wounded soldiers discharged from the hospital and returned to their units. The county government and the wounded soldiers' hospital jointly received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang, stating that wounded soldiers in the hospital should abide by the rules and focus on recuperation. Once cured, they should follow the regulations and be discharged from the hospital and return to their units. Recently, some unscrupulous wounded officers and soldiers have dared to shrink back and refuse to be discharged from the hospital after being cured, which is inappropriate. Therefore, two rules have been established to be observed: (1) Wounded officers and soldiers who are cured but refuse to be managed and refuse to be discharged from the hospital and return to their units will be charged with desertion in the face of the enemy. (2) Military personnel managing wounded soldiers and hospital staff who are ineffective and fail to diligently perform their duties will be charged with abandoning their responsibilities. Magistrate Sun and Hospital Director Cai received the telegram and immediately arranged for the cured wounded soldiers to be transported to the front lines to return to their units.</p>

<p>Two more robbery cases in the east countryside. The families of Sheng You-tang, Sheng Gui-rong, and Sheng Fang-yu, farmers in Beixin Village, Xinmiao Town, are located close to each other. Around midnight on June 30, they were simultaneously robbed by about twenty bandits, who had four or five guns. Most of them spoke with local accents and from Jinshankou. They first knocked on the doors of You-tang and Gui-rong's homes. Fang-yu took the opportunity to escape and ran to the village chief, Ma Jun's, house to sound the alarm. The bandits fired several shots in the direction of the alarm, but missed. They then divided into groups and looted, showing no fear. They tied up and beat You-tang, Gui-rong, and Fang-yu's son, Jin-sheng, causing them serious injuries. The losses were greater for the You-tang and Gui-rong families. After the robbery, they blew a horn and gathered in the direction of Luwan Temple in the southeast before leaving.

<p>District education officer expenses have become a problem. The county's school districts are divided according to the seven party districts of the former temporary party headquarters in the county, with one education officer per district receiving a monthly salary of 30 yuan. This salary is paid from the self-governance surcharge. Now that the district offices have been established, the provincial government previously ordered the county to return the 2,600 yuan in annual salaries of the district education officers by the end of May to be used for the district offices' expenses. After receiving the order, the education authorities found it difficult to raise the funds due to a severe shortage of education funds. It is absolutely impossible for the education administrative personnel, the district education officers, to be penny-pinching and starving themselves. This will affect the progress of education and hinder the development of school affairs.

<p>Dear Sir: I have been instructed by my uncle, Mr. Zhu Kongwen, that yesterday, upon returning to Shanghai from Suzhou, he saw a news item in the local section of your newspaper titled "Suspicious Actions, Investigation in Shanghai," which stated that Zhu Tingyu, Zhu Ronggui, Xiao Yunzhang, and others from Shanghai, claiming to be master and servants, were acting suspiciously and were detained and interrogated by the county government without providing any clear confessions. Zhu Tingyu also telegraphed Zhu Kongwen in Sanlintang, Pudong, requesting him to come and provide proof. He was greatly shocked to discover that there is no one named Zhu Tingyu or Zhu Ronggui in our family, nor is there anyone with such names among his friends. He also did not receive the telegram mentioned. It is feared that the information in your newspaper is based on hearsay. I have been instructed to request a correction. Zhu Fang, Attorney, July 4, 19th year.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Local Silver Reserves Decline Again <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>A decrease of 1,265,000 taels</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the local silver reserves have decreased significantly due to the lack of foreign silver imports and the large number of silver ingot exports. According to a survey, the current silver reserves are as follows: (1) Silver ingots and regulated silver: 110,028,000 taels, a decrease of 453,000 taels. (2) Silver dollars: 157,480,000 yuan, a decrease of 1,130,000 yuan. The above, converted to silver price, is 223,041,300 taels, a net decrease of 1,265,000 taels of silver.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Japanese Ship Violently Collides with Chinese Warship <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Dali Maru is heavily damaged.</p>
<p>The Weisheng warship is also damaged.</p>
<p>The responsibility lies entirely with the Japanese ship.</p>
<p>The Dali Maru, a Yangtze River vessel belonging to the Nissin Company, was heading to Shanghai from Hankou and collided with a naval warship while docked in Huangshigang. Both sides were injured. The Dali Maru has returned to Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Collision circumstances. The Dali Maru departed from Hankou at 9:00 PM on July 1. Recently, night navigation has been allowed in the Huangzhou-Daye area, so the ship sailed as usual. At 4:30 AM (on the morning of the 2nd), the ship arrived in Huangshigang. The Chinese naval warship Weisheng was docked there. The warship was ordered to suppress bandits and escort ships, so it was anchored in the river. Unexpectedly, when the Dali Maru was passing by the Weisheng warship, the stern of the ship was forced sideways by the current and crashed into the warship's bow. The Weisheng was anchored and could not move. With a loud crash, the stern of the Dali Maru crashed into the bow of the warship.</p>
<p>Damage condition. The accident was entirely the fault of the Japanese ship for negligent navigation. After the collision, the Dali Maru quickly reversed and backed away, but the bow of the Weisheng warship was damaged, and the stern of the Dali Maru was also severely damaged. Due to the intense impact, the entire second floor of the stern was destroyed, and all the passenger seats, office rooms, etc., were completely collapsed. Fortunately, the crew and passengers escaped from the rooms and were not injured. Also, the outer hull of the stern was also damaged. Fortunately, it was above the waterline, so the ship was able to safely return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Inspection and repairs in Shanghai. Yesterday, the ship arrived in Shanghai and docked at the Pudong Wharf. First, the cargo in each cabin was unloaded, and then the shipowner reported the incident to the company. The company has scheduled an engineer to inspect the ship today to determine the basis for repairs. The extent of damage to the head of the Weisheng warship must also be verified before negotiations can be conducted.</p>
<h3 id="e96">A Simple Explanation of the Cooperative Movement <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>(1) The cooperative movement is a new global economic organization movement intended to remedy the shortcomings of modern economic organizations that are solely profit-driven, by using cooperative organizations to connect producers and consumers, thereby eliminating the parasitic class of merchants who profit from the difference. This prevents producers from being manipulated and oppressed, and consumers from being exploited and controlled. It also aims to eliminate commercial warfare, prevent large enterprises from monopolizing, reconcile labor-capital conflicts, eliminate usury, and equalize economic profits through peaceful, thrifty, fair, self-reliant, and mutually supportive methods.</p>
<p>(2) The cooperative movement can unite the national spirit. The greatest defect of the Chinese nation is that it has always been a disunited mass. Therefore, to restore the inherent strength of the nation and promote lofty national consciousness, it is necessary to start with uniting the people. Engaging in cooperative enterprises can achieve the benefits of unity, and unconsciously cultivate a spirit of self-reliance, mutual assistance, shared virtues, shared hearts, shared joys, and shared sorrows, which is a great help to uniting the nation.</p>
<p>(3) The cooperative movement can promote the development of civil rights. The development of civil rights must start with training, hence the preliminary view of civil rights that "no gathering, no success." In a cooperative, "power" is in the hands of the members, while "ability" is the responsibility of specialists elected by the members. The "one person, one vote" system of cooperatives embodies the spirit of democracy, and its situation is the same as the separation of powers in the country. Therefore, the practice of working within cooperatives can provide training for the exercise of the four rights of election, recall, initiative, and referendum, and is a good method for promoting the realization of the principle of civil rights.</p>
<p>(4) The cooperative movement is the first step in realizing the Principle of People's Livelihood. The purpose of the cooperative movement is to achieve self-sufficiency for the people, not profit-making like capitalism, and to build a consciously economic organization that is equal, fair, and nurtures the people with a definite plan. Its purpose is the same as the Principle of People's Livelihood. However, the Principle of People's Livelihood has the power of politics, which uses legal systems to suppress the manipulation of landlords and capitalists and protect the rights of farmers and laborers. The cooperative movement is purely the effort of the people themselves and is solely an organizational method in the economic aspect, which is slightly different. However, only in this way can the economic power of the people themselves, gained through the efforts of the cooperative movement, be a supplement to political power and promote the success of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Therefore, the cooperative movement is the first step in realizing the Principle of People's Livelihood, and the cooperative movement can only succeed under the promotion of the Principle of People's Livelihood. It is to make cooperation materialize the Principle of People's Livelihood, not to cooperate the Principle of People's Livelihood.</p>
<p>(5) The cooperative movement is the foundation for establishing local autonomy. Local autonomy is the organization of local people managing their own politics and economy. The experience of cooperative enterprises can cultivate the concepts of self-help, self-reliance, and self-defense, which can also cultivate the foundation of autonomy. Therefore, the Premier has stipulated in the Local Autonomy Implementation Law that autonomous organs should promote cooperative enterprises. Now, in the midst of preparing for local autonomy, we should especially promote the cooperative movement to help each other forward.</p>
<p>(6) The cooperative movement can alleviate the suffering of farmers. Farmers account for more than 80% of the country's population. In addition to the difficulties in borrowing money, which affects their daily life hardships, the most painful thing is that the tiller cannot own his land. Therefore, in the Premier's equalization of land rights, in addition to formulating laws to restrict, protect, and reward, there are also provisions to support farmers in purchasing land so that they can "the tiller has his own land". The function of the cooperative is to use the spirit of connection and cooperation: (1) Apply consumer cooperatives so that farmers can directly purchase daily necessities from producers or wholesalers, avoiding the profits obtained by merchants through middlemen, and saving daily expenses. (2) Apply supply cooperatives so that farmers can jointly purchase fertilizers, seeds, and tools to increase the effectiveness of technology and increase the power of production. (3) Apply sales cooperatives so that farmers can sell directly to avoid merchants' exploitation and manipulation to increase the price of production. (4) Apply manufacturing cooperatives to enable farmers to jointly manufacture agricultural products that must be manufactured by machines, such as dairy products, to increase daily income. (5) Apply credit cooperatives to circulate assets, allowing farmers to improve their daily lives and obtain capital to purchase land, so that the tiller has his own land.</p>
<p>(7) The cooperative movement is the movement to liberate workers and small merchants. Because workers also suffer from the pain of lacking capital, even the lowest living standards are almost impossible to maintain. Therefore, the Premier's provisions for workers' relief include setting the highest and lowest wage limits, formulating factory management laws, determining labor insurance systems, and adopting profit-sharing systems to provide relief. However, all of these are legal provisions and equal assistance. If one can engage in the cooperative movement and strive for liberation on one's own, the results will surely be faster. Because production cooperatives can make workers the co-owners of factories, machines, and all production tools; construction cooperatives can make workers the co-owners of real estate; and consumer cooperatives can not only improve the daily lives of workers, but also make them shareholders and co-owners of savings in the society. Other urban small merchants also suffer from the pain of poor economic organization, no less than farmers and workers. Therefore, they can also organize cooperatives to avoid the oppression of large stores and reduce the cost of purchasing goods to generate more capital and improve their lives.</p>
<p>Slogans: (1) The cooperative movement is the first step in realizing the Principle of People's Livelihood. (2) The cooperative movement is the weapon to solve our country's economic problems. (3) The cooperative movement is the movement to develop the economy of the common people. (4) The cooperative movement can create capital. (5) The cooperative movement can regulate capital. (6) The cooperative movement can enable the tiller to have his own land. (7) The cooperative movement can establish the foundation of local autonomy. (8) The cooperative movement can eliminate social waste. (9) Cooperatives are the banks of the common people. (10) Cooperatives can eliminate the pain of usury. (11) Cooperatives can make prices low. (12) Cooperation can prevent the monopoly of large enterprises. (13) Cooperation can cultivate good morals. (14) Cooperation can cultivate thrifty habits. (15) Cooperation can improve the lives of farmers and workers. (16) Cooperation can promote the development of production. (17) Cooperation is "everyone for me, I for everyone." (18) The people of the whole country unite to participate in the cooperative movement.</p>

<p>Fierce Competition from Japanese Merchants</p>
<p>Serious Blow to Chinese Merchants</p>
<p>The annual sales of Chinese tea exported to Russia are quite large. Since the problem with Sino-Russian relations occurred, Sino-Russian trade has virtually stopped. Japanese merchants have taken the opportunity to compete fully, taking away most of the original position of Chinese tea in Russia. According to the statistics of the commercial officer of the Japanese embassy yesterday, Russian merchants have already placed orders with Japanese flower companies for this year (year 19), including Fuji Trading Co., Shizuoka Trading Co., etc., for about 4.2 million pounds. In addition, there are more than 100,000 pounds of orders from Russian merchants in Kyushu, Ureshino, and other places. It is found that in the past year, the largest number of Japanese tea exports to Russia was only 3.3 million pounds. It has suddenly increased by more than 1 million pounds in one year. These are all the original sales of Chinese tea that have been newly seized by Japanese tea. Therefore, the blow to Chinese tea is really shocking. Reported by the Japanese Embassy in China.</p>

<p>Meilong in this city is a rice-producing area, but in recent years it has often suffered from borer damage, resulting in poor rice harvests. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in view of this, specially entrusted Municipal Commissioner Yang Xinzheng to set up a cooperative experimental borer control zone in the area, sending Wu Shaomei to guide and inviting Wu Xiqin as a rural area instructor. In recent days, all sectors of the area have been working hard on borer control, such as lighting lamps to catch borer moths and searching for borer eggs. Because the borer damage in the area is extremely severe, it is heard that Instructor Wu intends to apply for the establishment of a borer moth and borer egg purchase station to achieve the purpose of borer control.</p>

<p>Continuing to Raise Donations</p>
<p>The low-priced rice distribution points set up by the city in the urban area since May 11 have sold more than 15,000 stones by the end of June, less than two months. From then on, it is the time when the new crop is not yet available, and the exchange rate is increasing, the source of foreign rice is reduced, and the market price will soar. People's food will inevitably feel panic, and the sales volume will inevitably increase. The low-priced rice committee is now working hard to raise a large amount of money to continue to purchase foreign rice at low prices. It is hoped that donations from all sectors will not be interrupted.</p>

<p>Municipal Commissioner Chen Yafu of Pu Song District, seeing that the poor residents of Pu Song were greatly affected by the high price of rice, specially obtained 400 bags of low-priced rice from the low-priced rice committee of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. They were loaded at Pu Song the day before yesterday, priced at 15 yuan per stone and 450 yuan per liter, and started selling at low prices yesterday (July 4) from 8:00 am to 11:00 am and from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm every day. One liter for a large family and half a liter for a small family. The low-priced rice selling point is located at the Municipal Commissioner's office. The staff is hired by the Municipal Commissioner's office and staff from various rice shops are jointly responsible for the handling. The method is that the head of each district first goes to investigate the extremely poor households and issues low-priced rice purchase certificates in order to benefit the poor and relieve their hardships. Yesterday was the first day of low-priced rice selling, and those who held tickets to buy rice were very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Bread-Eating Campaign <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Talk of an Economist</p>
<p>The recent price of rice has risen sharply, causing panic among the people. Yesterday, an economist talked about the bread problem as follows: The Shanghai proverb "thousands of pigs and ten thousand rice" describes the large population of the city. In fact, in recent years, the population has increased sharply, and ten thousand stones of rice cannot supply one day's food. The sound of panic over the people's food is rampant. To solve this problem, one must eat flour twice a week. Calculating with 3 million people, each person eats half a liter of rice per day, which requires 15,000 stones of rice. Eating flour for eight days for four weeks a month can reduce rice by 120,000 stones per month. If it can be implemented, the price of rice will be flat by itself. It is found that about 7 million stones of Saigon rice are purchased in the city, and at 15 yuan per stone, the money outflow will be more than 100 million yuan. If the leakage is not stopped, social and economic panic will be seen. According to the current flour price, No. 2 flour is 9 cents per catty. The current rice price is more than 1.5 cents per catty. Comparing eating rice with eating noodles, it is indeed a significant fact that economic savings are made. It is also found that there are many kinds of wheat, but wheat can be made into flour for various foods. All provinces in our country produce rice, but the Yangtze River Basin produces more. Therefore, the northern provinces have always been dominated by noodles, and the southern provinces have been dominated by rice. Now, when the price of rice is rising sharply, it is appropriate to change to eating flour. There are dozens of flour mills in the country, and there are 14 mills currently operating in Shanghai. The total flour produced in Shanghai every day is about 120,000 bags. Originally, each person needs to eat more than one liter of rice per day, but now each bag weighs 49 pounds and can replace a lot of rice. Recently, it was heard that Fuxin and other factories have already eaten noodles intermittently. Each person in the factory is given 5 or 3 cents of rice per day. The number of places using this method is gradually increasing. According to foreign governments, food is not taxed domestically. In our country, there is a special tax on flour of 1 cent per bag, which should be reduced to maintain the people's food. In addition, it is more appropriate to promote wheat planting and regulate transportation. The country's wealth and the people's strength depend on this. Municipal Government Relief</p>

<p>Since the Municipal Government delineated the city center area, the residents of the expropriated land are inevitably poor and unable to move. The Land and Public Security Bureaus have jointly investigated and opened a detailed list of names, ages, and population to plan relief. The Municipal Government has ordered the Preparatory Committee for the Construction of Civilian Housing to plan and manage the search for and record the original text as follows: In order to implement the case, the original plan of the government to build civilian housing was to accommodate poor households and relieve the poor who were unable to live. After this delineation of the city center area, the residents of the expropriated land are inevitably poor and unable to move. Efforts should be made to properly eliminate the situation as soon as possible to provide relief. The Land and Public Security Bureaus have been ordered to investigate and report in detail. Now, according to the investigation report and the completed investigation form, it is hereby ordered that the committee make proper plans and manage the overall situation, and report the planning and management situation for approval.

<p>The Shanghai County Government sent a letter to the Jiangsu Farmers' Bank yesterday, saying that on June 20 of this year, the government held a party-government talks to discuss the second item, requesting the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank to establish a Shanghai County Farmers' Loan Office. After discussion, it was passed. It is found that this case was previously decided by the party-government talks during the tenure of former County Chief Lu to request the establishment of the bank. After discussion, the former county chief found that after the division of urban and county areas in Shanghai, the county's jurisdiction was all rural areas, the land was barren and the people were poor, and the successive years of harvest were poor, and the farmers' livelihood was even more difficult. Moreover, the commercial city was depressed and there was a lack of financial adjustment agencies. The establishment of a farmers' loan office to provide relief is urgently needed. Therefore, another letter is sent to the office, hoping to investigate and establish it as soon as possible to benefit the farmers.</p>

<p>Implementation of the Abolition of the Shanghai Office</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan of the Central Government previously presented a request to the National Government to order various ministries to abolish their offices in Shanghai to save public funds. It was only the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining that complied with the order to abolish their offices in Shanghai and change them to minister's offices. As for the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, one was for raising military funds during the military period, and the other was for special circumstances in diplomacy. It has been presented to the National Government to postpone the abolition and has been approved. Yesterday, it was learned that the National Government believes that the Minister's Office and the Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining are no different and should not be retained. The Executive Yuan has ordered the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining to abolish and close the office immediately. Yesterday, Minister Yi Youxun's instructions arrived in Shanghai, ordering Director Zhu to abolish and close the office immediately, and to transfer all unfinished cases to Counselor Jin Wensi for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Plans to Change <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<h3 id="e112">Method of Measuring Earth Silk Inspection <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Gray Silk, Gray Warp, and Earth Silk from Zhejiang, Anhui, and Other Provinces Exempted from Inspection</p>
<p>Silk from Qi Li Warp and Factories in Sichuan, Hubei, and Shandong Inspected for Public Weight</p>
<p>Article 3 of the Detailed Rules for Silk Inspection of the Raw Silk Inspection Office of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau stipulates that all raw silk exported from Shanghai to foreign countries must be reported for inspection and public weight, and a certificate must be issued before customs declaration and export is allowed. Before the implementation of the detailed rules in April of this year, earth silk merchants and the Shanghai Export Silk Industry Association said that the situation of earth silk was complicated and the inspection and public weight might cause many obstacles. They repeatedly requested a postponement, and the bureau forwarded the request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consider the commercial situation and instructed to approve it. In the past two months, the New York Silk Association of America and the Lyon Silk Association of France have repeatedly sent letters and telegrams recognizing that the inspection and public weight of the Raw Silk Inspection Office of the bureau are very accurate and can be used as a basis for bilateral trade. The Shanghai Export Silk Industry Association has also repeatedly sent letters showing its approval and recognizing the merits of the public weight system, and has repeatedly requested that all raw silk and raw openings be forced to be inspected for public weight as soon as possible. However, earth silk has many types and complex situations, and it is difficult to test the public weight of a part of earth silk. The bureau plans to divide various earth silks into three categories: (1) Gray silk and gray warp silk are of poor quality and will change color or rot after baking, making it impossible to test for public weight. (2) The soil silk from Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Sichuan, Hubei, and other provinces is made using traditional methods without the use of new heavy shaking methods. The skeins are too large and it is impossible to sample in accordance with the world's silk sampling rules. The bureau's raw silk inspection and public weight equipment cannot be applied and it is inconvenient to test for public weight. Countries around the world have never had a precedent for mandatory inspection and public weight for the above two types of earth silk. It is planned to exempt them from inspection from August 1, regardless of public weight or net weight. When transporting them abroad, the bureau will issue an exemption certificate for customs declaration and export without any charge. (3) For silk from Qi Li Warp and factories in Sichuan, Hubei, and Shandong, its quality is not inferior to that of factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and its reeling is the same as that of factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. According to the purpose of inspection, it should not be placed in the ranks of soil silk. It is planned to inspect for public weight from August 1. Once the above methods are approved, the previously announced detailed rules for raw silk inspection must also be revised. The bureau has added revisions to the points that should be changed and submitted them to the ministry for approval. Now, it is instructed that the proposal to exempt grey silk, grey warp, and traditional silk from Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Sichuan, Hubei, and other provinces from inspection, regardless of net weight or public weight, from August 1, and to inspect silk from Qi Li Warp and factories in Sichuan, Hubei, and Shandong for public weight from August 1, should be approved and the detailed rules should be revised and re-ordered to be followed.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Recent News on Agricultural Product Inspection <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Preparing to Inspect Wheat Quality</p>
<p>And Various Agricultural Product Pests and Diseases</p>
<p>The Shanghai Agricultural Product Inspection Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining has been established for more than a year and a half. The inspection of man-made fertilizers has achieved considerable results, and the inspection and improvement of silkworm species have also been carried out in accordance with the regulations and have been reported in various newspapers. Now, Director Jin Wensi of the office has moved to No. 141 Tiantong Road near the Bund because the original address on Xinmin Road in Zhabei was inconvenient for transportation, and is actively preparing for the following three things: (1) Inspect wheat quality. There are many flour mills in Shanghai, and a lot of wheat is sold. Domestic farmers and vendors often have the bad habit of mixing water and mud. Not only does the manufacturer have problems with the machine after purchasing, but it is also unsanitary. Therefore, many manufacturers in Shanghai compete to purchase imported wheat, and the sales of domestic wheat are decreasing day by day. In order to improve the quality of wheat, Director Jin plans to inspect the northern production area first. He has now prepared the inspection trial method and submitted it to the ministry for approval. Once the ministry order is approved, the inspection can be started. (2) Inspect various agricultural product pests and diseases. Regarding the inspection of agricultural product pests and diseases, the office has jointly with the Guangzhou Agricultural Inspection Office prepared inspection methods and submitted them to the ministry for approval and publication. The ministry has also sent insect specialist Zhang Jingeo to prepare for this matter. Now, the preparations for the inspection have already begun. It is learned that the agricultural products that should be inspected for pests and diseases include livestock hair leather, meat, aquatic products, bees, fruits, flowers, seedlings, seeds, medicinal materials, wood, cotton products, and tobacco leaves. There are many types and it is planned to implement them in order of urgency and importance. (3) Food rice registration. The office previously received a ministry order transferring the resolution of the Central Political Conference to handle the import, export, and transit of food in Shanghai. It immediately actively prepared for it and is now generally ready. However, food registration is slightly different from the inspection of morning products and the improvement of agricultural properties in regulating people's food. The office has specially added a special affairs section to handle food registration matters, and it is heard that it has been submitted to the ministry and forwarded to the Executive Yuan for approval, and the inspector Jiang Hanluo has been appointed as the acting chief of the section, and the registration can be started soon.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Relief for Chinese Cigarette Factories <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Submits to the Executive Yuan for Approval. Recently, due to the surge in gold prices and increased costs, Chinese cigarette factories are on the verge of bankruptcy. The industry association convened an emergency meeting and resolved three relief measures, which were telegraphed to the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Industry, Commerce, and Finance for approval. However, no instructions have been received. A request was submitted to the Municipal Government for forwarding. The Municipal Government, after reviewing the submission, acknowledged the truthfulness of the situation and specially submitted it to the Executive Yuan for instruction and compliance. The original submission is recorded below:</p>
<p>Submission for forwarding matters: The Municipal Chinese Cigarette Factory Association submits a request. Chinese cigarette manufacturers heavily rely on American leaf tobacco to cater to social needs. Three years ago, the US dollar exchange rate was approximately 70 Shanghai taels per hundred. Recently, the rate has plummeted to between 34 and 35 taels. The surge in gold prices has broken all previous records, increasing costs by more than double. Increasing prices is restricted by tax brackets, and the price increase is insufficient to cover the six levels of cigarette tax. Ceasing production would harm the livelihood of workers, and worker unemployment would impact social stability. Chinese cigarette merchants today are in a situation where they cannot make a living if they advance and cannot cease production if they retreat, reaching a dead end. On the sixth of this month, the association convened an emergency meeting and resolved three relief measures, which were telegraphed to the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce for approval. No instructions have been received to date. If the government approves the relief, there is still hope for survival; otherwise, the remaining dozens of cigarette factories and tens of thousands of employed cigarette factory workers will inevitably become the next Nanyang Changxing within a year. This can be definitively stated. Representatives have been jointly dispatched by various factories to petition. We implore our mayor to provide unanimous assistance in forwarding the petition to the Executive Yuan, approving and accommodating the three relief measures telegraphed on the same day. Then, our Chinese cigarette industry can barely survive and temporarily retain a glimmer of hope. The pain is skin-deep, and life and death are at stake. We urgently and imprecisely express ourselves, hoping for understanding and consideration.</p>
<p>According to the petition submitted by the association representatives accompanied by the employees of various cigarette factories, the Municipal Government dispatched personnel to receive them and instructed them to await the forwarding of the petition and discuss relief measures for further compliance. It was verified that the claimed surge in gold prices and the sharp increase in costs, as well as the restriction on increasing prices due to tax brackets and the harm to workers' livelihoods from ceasing production, are indeed factual circumstances. Proper relief measures must be carefully considered to maintain the current situation. In addition to separate consultations with the Ministries of Finance, Industry, and Commerce, and instructions, the matter is reasonably forwarded for your review. It is requested that the three relief measures telegraphed by the association on the same day be approved for relief, and that instructions be followed for public convenience. Respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>Director Wu of the Shanghai County Construction Bureau believes that the narrow and uneven streets in the various townships and towns of the county not only easily cause fires but also hinder traffic. The County Government Council has resolved to survey them separately to facilitate reorganization. Currently, only the Fourth District of Sanlintang in Pudong has been surveyed, and the remaining districts have not yet been implemented. Therefore, Director Wu specially appointed technician Gong yesterday to lead a survey team to Tangwan, the Second District, for a preliminary survey.</p>

<p>Body Found in Xujiahui. It Seems There Has Been a Major Stimulation Recently.</p>
<p>Around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, a male corpse was discovered in the wilderness of Zhongshan Road near Xujiahui Xilonghua. Upon receiving a report from the villagers, the Sanjiaodi Police Station of the Second Precinct of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau dispatched police to investigate. They found a bullet wound between the temples of the deceased, entering from the left and exiting from the right. The deceased was wearing a white Xiangyun gauze long gown, white silk short shirt and trousers, black silk stockings, and black gauze shoes. He had a bald head and an eight-character-style mustache. Several business cards were found in his pocket, some of which bore the name "Wu Kunshan," identifying the deceased as Wu Kunshan, also known as Yu Ke, from Xuzhou. He resided at No. 19 Shengping Lane, Zilaihu Street, French Concession, and was 49 years old. He previously served as a battalion commander and magistrate in the military during Li Houji's time in Fujian. He resigned three years ago and came to Shanghai, where he had many friends. According to inquiries made by the Public Security Bureau to the villagers near the scene of the incident, two gunshots seemed to have been heard in the wilderness around 8:00 PM the previous night, and a car was seen speeding away. Unfortunately, no attention was paid. Wu himself left home around 6:00 PM the afternoon before, accompanied by his concubine, to play mahjong at a friend's house. He then went out alone and did not return late at night, causing his family to panic. It was not until yesterday morning that they learned of his death. The Dibao of the 28th Bao and 18th Tu reported to the court for an inspection, and Prosecutor Liu arrived at the scene and verified that Wu Kunshan had indeed died from a gunshot wound. He ordered a temporary burial and an investigation into the murder. Wu's wife and concubine, Li and Wang, and his married son, Kong Zhao, lived with Wu. However, the deceased had been acting abnormally recently and seemed to have been greatly stimulated. Post Office Driver.</p>

<p>Too Much Gambling and Too Many Debts. A Suicide Note Expresses Regret.</p>
<p>Shen A'fa, a 28-year-old from Ningbo, had been a car driver at the local General Post Office for seven years. He had always been diligent in his work and lived with his wife, Li, in Shanghai. The couple had a good relationship. Last November, Li returned to Suzhou to visit relatives and did not return until over a month later. During this time, A'fa accepted an invitation from a friend and began frequenting major gambling establishments in Shanghai, gradually developing a bad habit. He often did not come home at night, and he continued to deceive his wife, Li. Although Li knew some clues, there was nothing she could do. On the first day of this month (Monday), A'fa was on the early shift. He got up at 5:00 AM, put on his uniform, and went to the office to take over the shift. He returned home at 12:30 PM, where Li had prepared lunch. Unexpectedly, A'fa claimed that he wanted to go to a friend in Nanshi to retrieve 100 yuan. He did not eat lunch and changed into casual clothes before leaving. He instructed Li to expect him to return home for dinner. Li was reassured, but she waited in vain until late at night, suspecting that he was wandering around outside. After leaving home, A'fa, feeling unable to face others due to the excessive money he had lost gambling over the years, boarded the Xinjiangtian wheel from Shanghai to Ningbo around 4:00 PM on July 1st. The ship weighed anchor around 5:00 PM. Around 1:00 AM, A'fa asked a waiter on the ship if Dadai ocean had been passed. The waiter replied that it had not. A'fa returned to bed and slept quietly. Around 4:00 AM, while the ship's passengers were sound asleep, A'fa, wearing only a undershirt, was told that Dadai ocean had been passed. He walked to the back of the cabin and was not seen again. A search of the ship found nothing. However, a pair of shoes was left on the rear of the cabin, and a passenger said that he saw a shadow on the water early in the morning, but it disappeared in an instant. A thorough investigation was conducted when the ship arrived at Zhenhai and Ningbo, but no one was found. Later, the waiter found two suicide notes on the ship, one addressed to his wife and one addressed to his post office colleague, Wang A'gen, a photo, a post office car permit, and several pieces of clothing. Another piece of paper stated that the waiter should deliver them to Wang A'gen for forwarding.</p>
<p>Suicide Note One: To my virtuous wife, know that I have no choice but to walk this last path. From now on, you must take care of everything in the family and the children. If any outsiders come to collect debts, you must arrange things properly. From now on, it will be difficult for me to see you again. I owe you money, and I can only apologize to you. In the future, if anyone from the bureau comes, show them this letter. If there are any of my clothes that are returned to the bureau, please ask virtuous wife to go to Mr. Wang A'gen at the bureau once and tell them that your husband's money has nothing to do with my woman. He is currently of unknown life or death, and you must ask everyone to be understanding. I know I am sorry for you, so I am walking this last path. Life in this world is like a dream, and everything should not be taken too seriously. A gold watch pawn ticket is enclosed in the letter. Take care of your own body and take care of the child. The rent on the house is up this month, and everything must be arranged properly by yourself. No more to say. If there are any favors from friends and relatives, I will repay them in the next life. Pray that you take care of your body. Husband, the fifth day of the sixth month.</p>
<p>Suicide Note Two: To Mr. Wang A'gen, I have too much debt to others and cannot think of a way to solve it, so I have to leave. The people who are owed money will ask my woman for it. My woman is a weak woman and does not understand outside affairs. Please ask Mr. Tian at the bureau to find a way to help her with other matters. I have no choice but to leave. Please take care of everything. No more to say, I wish you a happy summer. Shen A'fa kowtows, the fifth day of the sixth month. Murder.</p>

<p>Sentenced to 18 Years Imprisonment.</p>
<p>The lunatic Zhang Jiazhen killed a woman, Wu Zhou, and a boy, Leng Cui Bao, and injured another boy in Tianfuli, Zhonghua Road, Xiaonanmen. After being arrested by the police and receiving medical treatment, he was transferred to the local court. After investigation, the prosecutor filed charges of two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. However, due to Zhang Jiazhen's mental incapacitation, he requested a reduced sentence. After repeated reviews and debates by the Criminal Court, Judge Zhao opened the court yesterday morning at 11:00 AM and announced the sentence after ordering Zhang Jiazhen to be brought to the court. Zhang Jiazhen was sentenced to two terms of eight years imprisonment for the two counts of murder and four years imprisonment for the attempted murder, to be served concurrently for a total of 18 years. The number of days of detention prior to the final judgment will be counted as two days for one day of imprisonment. After the sentencing, Zhang Jiazhen was asked if he accepted the 18 years of imprisonment. Zhang replied that he had no quarrel with the deceased and that it was God who told him to kill them. The official said that if he did not accept the judgment, he could file an appeal within ten days after receiving the judgment. He was then ordered to be returned to custody.

<h3 id="e120">Over Ten Thousand Gold Missing <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>No Remittance from Cuba Ever Received. Lawsuit Against Zhong Ruju in Shanghai Unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Over a dozen Cantonese people, including Tang Zheng Ying, Huang Ren Yi, Li Ju Yun, Huang Xuan Zhao, etc., were laborers in the Awanna region of Cuba. Over the course of time, their wages and hard-earned income accumulated to over ten thousand gold. In March and April of the fifteenth year, the Chinese-owned Xin Shenglong Money Exchange was tasked with remitting the funds to China. The money was to be drawn from the Liangxin Bank in Hong Kong. The bank was the Hong Kong branch of Xin Shenglong. Its nature was like a joint firm. Later, Tang and the others took the remittances back to China to redeem them in Hong Kong, but they were not redeemed. The remittances were returned to Cuba, and Xin Shenglong had already closed. Liangxin Bank then shut down as well, and Tang's funds never arrived. Recently, it was learned that the manager of Xin Shenglong, Zhong Ruju, a Cantonese native, was operating a printed paper company in Shanghai. Huang Dingzhi was selected to be the representative to come to Shanghai and hire a lawyer to file a criminal complaint with the Special District Court against Zhong for fraudulently obtaining money by falsely establishing an organization and also requested a judgment to repay the 11,900+ Hong Kong dollars and 1,376+ US dollars in civil litigation. The defendant Zhong Ruju also hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to defend, saying that the plaintiff Huang Dingzhi was not a creditor, so he did not qualify to file the lawsuit. The owner of Xin Shenglong Money Exchange was Zhong Qunying, and he had a license from the Cuban Registration Bureau as evidence. The victim had once been the manager of Xin Shenglong, but he had resigned in the fifteenth year. His successor was Liang Chuanfa. The plaintiff's lawsuit for fraud took place after the defendant resigned, so he naturally bore no responsibility. Furthermore, the defendant did not issue remittances in March and April of the fifteenth year, so the evidence could be checked. Based on the above reasons, he requested that the case be dismissed. After several hearings and examinations by Judge Cheng Shangfeng, it was concluded that the plaintiff's lawsuit against Zhong Ruju was not established. Yesterday, Zhong Ruju was declared innocent and released.</p>

<p>Throwing Bombs after Failed Extortion. Five Gang Members Arrested and Convicted Separately.</p>
<p>Gangsters Liang Guihong, Du Jingbo, Chen Hanting, Li Qing, He Yaozhou, and others from Guangdong, along with Liang You and others at large, organized the Tianfeng Society gang and established their headquarters in the East Asia Hotel in the Public Concession. They repeatedly sent letters to a wealthy merchant in the French Concession threatening and attempting to extort money. When this failed, they threw bombs in an attempt to harm him, but they were unsuccessful. They were detected by Detectives Chief Shen Defu, Inspector Chen Sanlin, Detective Lu Jinbao, and Private Detective Gu Mingzhou of the French Police. They arrested Liang and the other four men together and seized a package of bomb-making gunpowder and the Tianfeng Society seal. They were taken to the police station and handed over to the French Court for investigation. First, Chief Detective Sarcal explained the situation and questioned Liang Guihong, who confessed that it was Liang You who instigated him to write four threatening letters. Du Jingbo and the other four also confessed to committing the crime together. The French and Chinese officials sentenced Liang to five years in the French prison, deportation, and transfer to the mainland government for punishment. The other four were each sentenced to three years, after which they would be permanently expelled from the Concession. The confiscated gunpowder was destroyed. Greek Sentence Not Expired.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Request for Release Denied <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Fourteen-Year Sentence for Wife Murder. Already Ten Years in Prison.</p>
<p>Seriously Ill and Requests Release. Examination Results Not Approved.</p>
<p>The Greek George Coporosis killed his wife in Shanghai on July 26 of the tenth year of the Republic of China and was sentenced to fourteen years of imprisonment by the former Mixed Court on October 13 of the same year. He was sent to the West Prison on Xiamen Road to serve his sentence, and he has already been there for ten years. The prisoner is now fifty-two years old. He has contracted a disease in prison and treatment has not been effective. According to the Western doctor, he needs long-term treatment. Therefore, the Western warder of the prison reported to the patrol officer, who brought the prisoner from the prison to the Special District Court yesterday morning to request that the remainder of his sentence be suspended. Judge Cheng Shangfeng opened the court for interrogation. George stated that he had been in prison for nine years and that he had been suffering from serious illnesses in his waist and chest in recent years, causing his nerves to weaken. The doctor diagnosed that his illness was incurable and that he could only drink a little milk and eat a little bread every day. There were three other prisoners in his cell, and he could not sleep peacefully at night, which made him feel even more pain. He said that he regretted committing the crime of murder in the past and requested leniency and release. Tears streamed down his face. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang said that the defendant's serious illness had been confirmed by the Director of the Municipal Council Health Bureau and that he intended to request that the remainder of his sentence be suspended. The prisoner had been suffering from illness and had torn up his bed sheet and made it into a long strip to hang himself on the morning of the 11th of last month. The Western guards in charge of the prison found him and quickly rescued him. The prison warden asked him why he hanged himself, and he said that because he was suffering from illness, the Health Bureau had intended to release him twenty months ago, but this had not happened. In addition, because there was no appeal body, he could not appeal at the time, which led to his imprisonment. It was found that the prisoner had attempted suicide more than once since entering prison. The Municipal Council had made the same request during the Provisional Court period, but it had not been approved. The leaders of the Greek merchants in Shanghai had recently written to the police stating that if the prisoner could be released, they would be willing to guarantee him and send him back to his country. After his illness was cured, they would return him to the police to serve the remainder of his sentence. The prisoner would be released when his sentence was up in April of 1932. Judge Cheng then ordered the court's forensic doctor to examine the prisoner's body and report back. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Cheng continued the court hearing. The forensic doctor examined the prisoner in court and said that although the prisoner had a disease, it did not pose a danger to his life. Therefore, he issued an order stating that, according to the forensic doctor's report, the prisoner had a nervous disorder, but it did not prevent him from serving his sentence, which was inconsistent with the provisions of Article 485, Paragraph 4 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The request to suspend the execution was not approved, and the prisoner was sent back to the West Prison on Xiamen Road by the police.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Land Purchase Scam <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>All Deeds Were Forged. Seller and Landlord Accused.</p>
<p>Local people Lu Fugen and Lu Tiansheng sold 7.5 li of land located at No. 12 Tu, No. 23 Bao, to Ningbo native Zhu Shien in December of the 16th year of the Republic for 3,500 yuan. The landlord Yang Yiwen was the intermediary and guarantor when the contract was drawn up. Yang also guaranteed that he could transfer the deed in the future. If a measurement was desired, the actual land was over 8.6 li. Zhu paid the land price but withheld 500 yuan until all procedures were completed and verified. However, more than two years have passed, and the deed has not been transferred. Despite repeated inquiries, the matter was evaded. Furthermore, Zhu later investigated and found that the land was actually only 7.5 li and did not exceed that amount. Therefore, he sued the two Lus in the Provisional Court earlier this year, requesting a judgment to enforce the contract and compensate for the losses. The two Lus repeatedly avoided being summoned, and the case is still unresolved. Last month, Zhu received a letter from Tailey Yanghang, which was transferred for deed transfer, stating that the household names Lu Chunlin and Lu Degui on the deeds submitted by the two Lus were all forged, as verified by the Municipal Land Bureau. Zhu realized that he had been scammed and hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a criminal complaint against the two Lus and landlord Yang Yiwen, requesting that they be punished for forging official documents and defrauding money. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened the court. Lawyer Chen presented the forged deeds and other documents, explained the case, and requested an investigation. He also said that the private lawsuit had already been filed separately. Zhu Shien then testified about the circumstances of purchasing the land from the defendants at the time.

Moreover, relying on their numbers, they act despotically without fixed prices. Shipping merchants Xing Zhigang and others witnessed this situation and immediately reported it, requesting the Municipal Public Security Bureau to order the water patrol team and the first district, first precinct to investigate thoroughly. It was confirmed and repeatedly prohibited on record. Unexpectedly, lighter bosses Xi Akun and Zhang Renhe continued unrepentantly, and were summoned and detained a few days ago.

<p>Xiangya, Zu'an Factories Prevent Workers from Receiving Injections　　The Municipal Health Bureau Issues Letter of Reprimand Concerning Workers' Health　　When the Health Bureau dispatched doctors to the Xiangya Factory and Zu'an Electrical Weaving Socks Factory in Shanghai to give workers free epidemic prevention injections, the managers, begrudging a few minutes of work time, prevented the workers from stopping work to get the injections. The Health Bureau's epidemic prevention personnel told them that protecting workers' health would increase production capacity. The Health Bureau's encouragement of epidemic prevention injections was entirely voluntary and would not cost the factory or workers a single cent. They should not prevent workers from the opportunity to prevent disease, and reported back to the bureau. Yesterday, the bureau sent a letter of reprimand, saying, "On the first of this month, this bureau dispatched doctors to your factory to give all workers free cholera prevention injections. The workers were about to receive the injections, but your executives not only did not enthusiastically urge them to accept the injections, but instead prevented them. This kind of ignorant behavior is simply because you think that workers taking injections will take up a little over a minute or two of work time. It can be seen that your factory is excessively concerned with private profits and indifferent to workers' health. Your vision is narrow and your love for the community is weak, which is very regrettable. We will still dispatch doctors to your factory this month to give workers free cholera prevention injections. We hope that your executives can accept good advice and no longer hinder the workers from enjoying the benefits of free prevention. This is of utmost importance. This is addressed to Zu'an Electrical Weaving Socks Factory and Xiangya Factory."</p>

<h3 id="e148">Silk Weaving Industry Labor-Management Dispute <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Government Arbitrated Yesterday　　In the Shanghai silk weaving industry, the factory owners' announcement of a wage reduction in January caused a labor-management dispute. Although the Bureau of Social Affairs repeatedly convened mediation meetings, no resolution was reached. The factory owners submitted a request for arbitration to the Municipal Government, which determined that the labor-management dispute was important and scheduled an arbitration meeting yesterday, appointing Huang Daolin as the chairman. The capital side was represented by four factories, Tiancheng, Jinhua, Youren, and Zhonghua. The labor side was represented by ten factories, Yutong, Yunlun, Fenghua, Xianghua, Meiwen, Zhenhua, Tiancheng, Jinhua, Youren, and Zhonghua. The chairman first instructed both sides to express their views. The capital side's reason was that there were over a hundred silk weaving factories in Shanghai. Because ten factories had labor unions, wages gradually increased, increasing costs and making it difficult to compete with other factories. Therefore, in January of this year, the trade association decided to reduce wages to maintain the status quo. The labor side's reason was that the cost of living was increasing day by day, and they had already been very understanding of the factory owners by not asking for a wage increase. The factory owners abruptly reduced wages to half, which was against the trend. The factory owners claimed that the wages of other factories were all small-scale family handicraft industries, which were difficult to compare. Therefore, they firmly requested the restoration of the original wages. After the chairman understood the situation, he consulted with the other committee members and advised both sides to make concessions. The arbitration decision can be sent to the trade union within days.</p>
<h3 id="e149">No Occupancy of Trade Association's Buildings <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Bureau of Social Affairs Replies to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce　　Orders the Trade Union to Vacate the Buildings. Special Letter Requesting the Bureau of Social Affairs to Order the Trade Union to Vacate Yesterday, the Bureau of Social Affairs replied, "This Bureau has received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Committee for the Reorganization of Business Groups stating that the Trade Association is demanding the Trade Union vacate the buildings and the Trade Union has forcibly occupied the buildings for use as an office. In addition to ordering the Trade Union to comply, a corresponding letter is sent to your office for your information."</p>
<h3 id="e150">Re-election of Committee Members for the Money Industry Market <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The money industry market affiliated with the Ningbo Road Longqing Lane Money Industry Association is crowded with people during the morning and afternoon trading hours every day. Therefore, in the past, it was proposed to publicly elect two qualified and experienced staff members from the employees of various money banks to serve as committee members to maintain market order and resolve disputes. This has been in place for several years and has been very successful. However, the term of office for these publicly elected committee members is set at two years, and they can be re-elected consecutively. It is purely voluntary. The current committee members are Hu Gesheng of Ankangzhuang and Lu Shuchen of Shunkangzhuang. They have already served two consecutive terms, and their terms will expire again in July of this year. They should be re-elected. (According to the market rules, employees are limited to assistants. If they are promoted to assistant manager, they are no longer eligible to be market committee members or election committee members). Originally, both Hu and Lu could be re-elected, but this year, Hu was promoted to assistant manager of Yongshengzhuang, and Lu was also promoted to assistant manager of Shunkangzhuang, so neither is eligible for re-election. Therefore, new committee members must be produced in this re-election. The election is currently underway and will be announced soon.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao: With regard to the questions raised by Mr. Wang Yasheng in your newspaper's June 30th issue concerning the National Photography Exhibition, Mr. Wang has some misunderstandings, and we would like to clarify as follows: "Subscribing to a copy of the photography magazine" does not make one a member of our association. Ordinary members are required to pay an annual fee of eight yuan upon joining, while the subscription fee is only two yuan. Details are stated in the association's charter, which can be requested by mail. Regarding Mr. Wang's statement about "hiring a Westerner who falsely claims to be a member of the Royal Photographic Society of England...", Mr. Deng Tuo is indeed an "honorary" or "affiliated" member (there is no standard translation in our country) A.R.P.S. This is a fact and not a false claim. Furthermore, Mr. Deng Tuo was also a judge in last year's competition. Since the exhibition has no prizes, there is no need for judges. Mr. Wang seems to be confusing the competition with the exhibition. We are well aware that Mr. Deng Tuo is very knowledgeable about photography. "There are many Chinese photographers whose skills are higher than Deng Tuo's," please introduce them to us. We would be happy to welcome them, as our association will hold the eighth photography competition next spring. Sincerely, Secretary of the Chinese Photographic Society.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Measures to Preserve the National Sports Field <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Build barracks on the other side of the playground Expenses will be shared equally by all officers in the same province The National Games closed on April 11th, and all field work has been rushed to completion. The Ministry of Military Affairs previously stated that the site would not be needed temporarily.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Sports Advancement Association Ground Temporarily Not to Be Recovered <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Although the Rockefeller contract has expired, it can still be used for a short time. The board of directors is actively seeking another location for a permanent solution. The ground of the Labor Father Road China Sports Advancement Association, owned by the American oil magnate Rockefeller, was unconditionally lent to our country as a place to promote amateur sports. The contract expired on June 20th of this year. The Sports Advancement Association recently re-negotiated with the Rockefeller Foundation for a renewal of the loan, but the Rockefeller Foundation had to take back the land and refused to renew the loan. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that Dr. Yu Rizhang, Secretary-General of the National YMCA, negotiated with the Rockefeller Foundation and can still continue to use it because the land will not be used for other purposes in the next few years, nor will it be sold, and it must be preserved. According to observations by those related to the Rockefeller Foundation, although the contract for the ground has expired, it will not be recovered. However, for the sake of planning future work, the Sports Advancement Association is conducting further negotiations with the Rockefeller Foundation to determine the term of renewal, whether it is half a year or a year, so as not to hinder the undertaking of the ideal cause. The board of directors of the Advancement Association is seeking another piece of land to build its own sports ground as a fixed clubhouse. In short, the Rockefeller's land currently has no intention of being recovered, and the sports cause in this city and the whole country will not be affected. It is necessary to temporarily allocate the ground as a barracks and training ground, which will be beneficial for both preservation and custody. A request was submitted to the Executive Yuan to order the Zhejiang Provincial Government to comply. Dai Chuanxian, Chairman of the Association, believed that the construction cost of the dormitory used on the ground was huge. If it is not properly preserved, it would be a great pity. To allocate it as a military barracks would further prolong the trampling, which is definitely not the best policy. For the sake of the overall interests of both parties, three measures for disposal were formulated and submitted to the Central Government for forwarding to the Ministry of Military Affairs for notification. The three measures are recorded as follows: (1) The Zhejiang Provincial Government will delineate a piece of land outside the city equal in size to the current training ground and build barracks and training grounds. The expenses will be borne equally by the National Government and the Zhejiang Provincial Government. (2) The current sports ground will be designated as the National Hangzhou Sports Ground and handed over to the Education Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government for management. (3) Before the above construction is completed, the current sports ground will be temporarily lent to the military for use. The sports construction on the ground will be the responsibility of the Zhejiang Provincial Education Department to take care of. The above measures have been resolved by the Zhejiang Provincial Committee and the Education Department has been ordered to send personnel to take over. However, since the site will be allocated for military use before the new barracks are completed, the protection of the sports buildings on the ground is quite difficult. It seems that the ground should be demarcated and the remaining houses should be temporarily lent to the military. This method of dividing and living can take into account both military use and the maintenance of public education. This measure will be submitted by the Zhejiang Provincial Government to the Executive Yuan for an order to the Ministry of Military Affairs for joint notification.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Far East Games <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Changes in Track and Field Events At the 9th Far East Games held in Japan in mid-May of this year, representatives of the three countries met and decided to divide the track and field events into two championships, track and field, and also made changes in the events. As a result, the 800-meter relay was cancelled and changed to a 400-meter relay (4X100), the 200-meter low hurdles were changed to 400-meter intermediate hurdles, and the twelve-pound shot put was changed to a sixteen-pound heavy item. The items are as follows: Track Championship Field Championship High Jump 100 meters Long Jump 100 meters Triple Jump 400 meters Pole Vault 800 meters Discus 1500 meters Javelin 10000 meters Sixteen-pound shot put 110 meters high hurdles 400-meter low hurdles In addition, the all-around sports championship includes five events, ten events, 400-meter relay, and 1600-meter relay. In addition, Japan proposed to add the hammer throw to the field events, but it failed to pass due to opposition from China and the Philippines, but it was allowed to be included as a performance. It is found that in the World Olympics, there is only a sixteen-pound shot put but no twelve-pound one, there are only 400-meter low hurdles but no 200-meter ones, and the relay races are 400 meters and 1600 meters but no 800-meter relay. Japan's proposal this time is completely based on the standards of the World Games, because Japan's goal is to compete in the world arena, not in the Far East Games of China, Japan, and the Philippines. The revised events are of great benefit to our country. It is deeply hoped that the sports circles of all countries will work hard to promote the Guangdong Women's Table Tennis Team.</p>

<p>The City No. 1 Public Stadium Amateur Tennis Competition was originally scheduled to start on the 2nd, but the weather was not good and it rained heavily, causing the athletes to have no place to show their talents. It cleared up yesterday, but the ground was not completely dry in the morning and it was still difficult to start the competition. It was not until the afternoon that the games were divided and the players competed for a ball addiction. The results of yesterday's competition and the schedule for this afternoon and tomorrow morning are recorded as follows: Group Contestants Results Fang Yang Xie Mao beat Xiao Mingzu 1 to 6, 6 to 3, 9 to 7 Xiao Wu Maoqing beat Wang Keyong 2 to 6, 6 to 4, 6 to 3 Xia Shen Shounan beat Zhao Qingxiang Zhao Qingxiang abandoned the match Hao Wang Liang beat Wang Hongye 2 to 6, 6 to 3, 6 to 0 Hao Sun Chuanxin beat Wang Shanjun 6 to 3, 6 to 4 Looking at the matches, the battle between Yang Xie Mao and Xiao Mingzu was the most dramatic. Yang was thin and tall, while Xiao was short and stout. They competed against each other, reflecting each other interestingly. In the first game, Yang felt unfamiliar with the racket and missed opportunities in serving, so he suffered a huge blow. In the second game, Yang's energy suddenly increased and he was able to handle both positive defense and resistance with ease. He also served with power, and Xiao was unable to fight hard and eventually lost. The third game contained the nature of the final, and both sides naturally worked harder, and the ball skills were also ingenious, with constant additions and subtractions, making it difficult to distinguish between high and low. In the end, Xiao was slightly tired and was taken advantage of by the enemy and ended. However, the score had already reached 9 to 7.

<p>The all-Shanghai Chinese handball singles competition hosted by the YMCA has become increasingly serious since it started. Yesterday's Group A match between Sun Daosheng and Chen Hualu, a battle between the old and the new, was very interesting. A ball flew back and forth, and the two chased after it, with constantly changing heights and positions. Shao Jiang Chen Hualu was full of courage and his hands and feet were nimble. He was surprisingly successful and won the first game with a score of 21 to 13. In the second game, the old hero Sun Daosheng cheered up and was temporarily invincible, killing the opponent so that they could not take care of themselves and had difficulty parrying. He won back with a score of 21 to 2. The third game was a matter of life and death for the two, and both sides worked very hard, and the performance was excellent, making it impossible to not appreciate it. Sun won the final victory with a score of 21 to 8 in the third game due to his quick hands and proper handling. Wei Guanghan, the oldest in Group B, played against Wu Weizhou. Wei was the oldest in Group B. On that day, his performance was very much like an old general riding alone and invincible. Wu Weizhou tried hard to win under adverse circumstances, but it was difficult to achieve his wish. As a result, Wei won two consecutive games with a score of 20 to 13 and 21 to 14. The competition between Yang Chengcai and Lu Mengsheng in Group C was extremely intense. At first, Yang killed the opponent frequently and his momentum was great. He soon won the first game with a score of 21 to 6. However, starting from the second game, Lu showed his heroic qualities. His second-hand movement was appropriate, and he was able to cope with both sides, reversing the situation and taking a great advantage. He actually won the second and third games with a score of 21 to 17. Referees: Chen Fuzhang, Huang Kesu Records: Wu Chengmo, Hong Rulin Yesterday's Results Group A: Sun Daosheng beat Chen Hualu 13 to 21, 21 to 2, 21 to 8 Group B: Wei Guanghan beat Wu Weizhou 21 to 13, 21 to 14 Group C: Lu Mengsheng beat Yang Chengcai 6 to 21, 21 to 11, 21 to 17 Schedule for Next Week Group A: Huang Kesu vs. Ni Hongen Group B: Tan Zhonghua vs. Lu Aibai Group C: Cheng Zhenhua vs. Qu Zhengu</p>

<p>In September of the sixth year of the Republic of China, I married Wu of Yuyao, nicknamed Amao, through a matchmaker. At first, we lived in harmony. However, last year, she did not abide by the virtues of a wife and absconded with money, losing more than 3,000 yuan of Qiyang from Kaiming. After finding her back, I repeatedly admonished her and reluctantly took her in to give her a chance to reform. Unexpectedly, this year, Wu relapsed and took advantage of the unpreparedness of others on June 26th to abscond with jewelry, diamond rings, clothes, cash, and other items worth more than 4,000 yuan. She transported them out first and also fled on the 27th. I have been searching everywhere but cannot find her. After discovering this, I reported it to the police station within half an hour. The police station ordered an investigation and will arrest her at any time. Wu's act of absconding again is not only contrary to the virtues of a wife, but also a complete severance of affection. In addition to taking legal action separately, I hereby publish a warning, limiting her to return within three days to negotiate the severance of the marital relationship. I will not be responsible for any of her actions. This is to inform the public. Zhang Zhongwen</p>

<h3 id="e280">A Phonetic Alphabet Incense Screen in the Words of Wu Zhirou <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>The other day, Wu Zhirou gave a speech on the phonetic alphabet at the Legislative Yuan's weekly meeting, full of humor and wit. This old gentleman's romantic charm is truly not shallow. Let's pick up a few bits to share as conversation starters.</p>
<p>The phonetic alphabet should be considered like incense shoes. Compared to the writing systems of Europe, America, and Japan, the phonetic alphabet currently being studied in our country is not just ten or a hundred times easier. To use the analogy of shoes that fit, those countries certainly have their own leather shoes and wooden clogs. These leather shoes and wooden clogs cannot be afforded by everyone in our country. The phonetic alphabet, however, can be compared to straw sandals. These straw sandals can be afforded by the people of our country, even those who live in remote and impoverished areas or who are so poor they have no land to stand on. Moreover, they are extremely cheap and useful. If they are deemed too simple and cannot be presented in elegant settings, it is not too late to devise methods to improve them in the future to make them refined and beautiful. Gentlemen, do not despise these humble straw sandals.</p>
<p>A Beauty Falls from the Sky Amidst the Sound of a Shepherd's Flute. If the phonetic alphabet can be popularized throughout the country, then even old women, servants, and shepherds can rely on it to read and write. What could be greater or more convenient than its utility? Let's talk about the scene of a shepherd tending cattle. In the setting sun, amidst fragrant grass, a shepherd boy rides backward on an ox, playing a short flute, followed by singing, "Drifting and swaying, a beauty falls from the sky." Such charm and flavor are truly difficult for ordinary people to hope to achieve. Subsequently, this can be proven by citing idioms and drawing analogies from various regions. Those who heard this could not help but burst into laughter.</p>
<p>On that day, Mr. Wu's speech lasted for two hours. He was full of energy and could even imagine the psychology of the audience, interspersed with anecdotes of rare foreign knowledge. It was truly rare, so it was said.</p>

<p>An Elder of Over Seven Hundred Years, Ji Jin</p>
<p>Mr. Li from the same village returned from Southeast Asia, mentioning that in northern Borneo, there was an old man who claimed to be over seven hundred years old. His beard and hair were slightly white, and he was full of energy, looking like he was only sixty or seventy years old. People were generally skeptical of this. When asked about his methods of cultivation, his diet and clothing were no different from ordinary people's. However, he took a seawater bath every day, and he had never stopped since he was young. This is a common occurrence for those living by the sea and is not unusual. He was then asked how old his wife and children were. He replied that his wife was forty years younger than him, his oldest son was four hundred and eighty-six years old, and his youngest was three hundred and sixty-four years old. He had a new grandson fifteen years ago who was still in swaddling clothes. He added that he had children late and hoped for grandchildren very much, and their existence was a comfort to him. This kind of fantastic story made people laugh. After careful investigation, it was discovered that there was no calendar there, and the locals regarded each full moon cycle as a year. Thus, this "seven-hundred-year-old" man was not yet seventy years old. The world is so big that there is no end to wonders. This is specially recorded to support the topic.</p>
<p>The weather has suddenly turned hot in recent days. The sun is like a fiery umbrella hanging high in the sky during the day, with temperatures reaching over ninety degrees. Even at night, the heat is still oppressive. Therefore, cries of "It's hot!" can be heard everywhere. Here are some observations and notes taken while sweating profusely.</p>
<p>Strolling in the Park. This is the most fashionable and economical way to escape the heat. Therefore, although there are many parks in Shanghai, they are always crowded with visitors during the summer. Gujia Garden is especially popular. The green grass is like a carpet, and the cool breeze is refreshing. Every evening when the sun sets, walking in it is enough to make one feel refreshed and reluctant to leave. What is most envied is seeing couples sitting side by side by the pond, either teasing the fish or whispering sweet nothings. There is truly a feeling of "preferring to be mandarin ducks rather than envying immortals."</p>
<p>Eating Cold Foods. During the summer in Shanghai, countless temporary food stalls selling cold foods spring up. They sell nothing but soda, ice cream, and all kinds of frozen foods. Those who fear the heat flock to them, making their business extremely prosperous. Small stalls selling sour plum juice and shaved ice can also be seen everywhere on the sides of the road, catering to the needs of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Riding in Cars. There are also some wealthy people who take their families or lovers out for a drive in the evening. In secluded areas, they speed along, making the locals envious. However, this year, the price of gold has skyrocketed, and the price of gasoline has also increased accordingly. Therefore, those who enjoy driving for pleasure are inevitably affected to some extent.</p>
<p>Watching Movies. In past summers, except for open-air cinemas (the best-equipped open-air cinemas in Shanghai are the Dahua Hotel and the Paris Theatre), other movie theaters generally had slow business. However, this year is different. The theater owners have spared no effort in improving their climate control equipment. The air conditioning system installed in the Nanjing Grand Theatre is especially satisfying, and the temperature inside the theater can be reduced by fifteen degrees compared to the outside, making one feel as if they are in an ice cellar. This is also a way to escape the heat.</p>
<h3 id="e282">Jottings from a Journey, Practice <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>Trip to Jinan. The scenery of Jinan has long been famous throughout the country, and the seventy-two springs are especially scenic natural wonders. After being described by the author of "The Travels of Lao Ts'an," the black girl by Daming Lake and the beautiful scenery of Jin Mian Spring are especially unforgettable images in our imagination. After arriving in Jinan, I spent two days visiting scenic spots such as Pearl Spring, Daming Lake, Baotu Spring, and Thousand Buddha Mountain. Pearl Spring is located inside the provincial government compound and is a square pool of water. Spring water gurgles from the bottom of the pool, constantly gushing out from the gaps in the rocks. At the same time, countless bubbles rise with it, forming a string of pearls that never stop. It is truly a spectacle. What is strange is that the spring water has never dried up for thousands of years, and these continuous pearl-shaped bubbles have never stopped for even a second. It would be impossible to create this kind of miracle even with all our human effort, which shows the greatness of natural power. All I saw at Daming Lake was a patch of reeds so high that they could drown a person. There were one or two tea seats and several painted boats, but a lot of mud had accumulated on the bottom of the spring, so the area of the lake had shrunk considerably.</p>

<p>On the 11th, I visited the Chinese Circus, whose troupe leader, Sun Fuyou, is from Hejian. His wife is German and speaks Chinese. Sun has traveled in Europe for a long time, which is why he is fluent. The performance was quite entertaining, with seventeen horses, several large and small elephants, lions, tigers, and leopards. The elephants seemed to understand human intentions. The tigers could be played with, and even when their chains were released, they would calmly return to their cages and not try to escape. The tigers eat several pounds of beef a day, fed twice. I had seen leopards in Japan jump through flaming hoops, and Western horses were said to be able to do arithmetic. Now, these horses can also turn between four chairs without error, but it is not natural; they are directed by the whip. Bears can dance with sticks, but they always beg for food, looking very shameless. Tigers, on the other hand, would never do this. Observing the innate personalities of these animals, their inherent goodness, evil, benevolence, and violence are fixed and cannot be changed. Human nature is probably also difficult to change. Religious figures, educators, and proponents of evolution and hypnotism all say that human nature can be changed. I certainly advocate that it can be changed, but seeing how difficult it is to change the personalities of animals, I cannot help but sigh. In Nanjing, I watched a tiger eat a chicken, starting from the legs and eating up to the head, then discarding the chicken while it was still alive. I watched it with my family and felt sorry for the chicken. But elephants naturally beg for food, and tigers naturally eat meat. These inherent natures are difficult to change, so how can there be equality? I take full responsibility for those who want to transform society. I have two methods for this. First, we must use eugenics to prevent inferior breeds and criminals from reproducing. Second, we must use hypnotism. If all else fails, we must resort to surgery on those who cause chaos to achieve peace. Complaining about the environment is useless if human nature cannot be changed.</p>
<p>On the 11th, Mr. Lu Weichang of the Jingwu Association invited me to see the Chinese martial arts performance of the circus. The troupe is jointly organized by the Jingwu Association and is quite large, with about seventy or eighty people. They have traveled from Guangdong to Annam, Siam, Singapore, and are about to go to the Dutch colonies to tour America. Their tent can hold three or four thousand people and is very flexible to set up. When not in use, it can be rolled up and carried to other cities. The interior is four or five fathoms high, and the electric lights are as bright as day, and it is not afraid of rain. It imitates European designs. European circuses constantly tour and perform in various places. Women perform martial arts on a tightrope. Westerners applaud when they see it, and they especially like how they can do somersaults from a height of four or five fathoms without falling. People are surprised and do not understand how they can be so good. Also, Mr. Sun can hold a pole more than two fathoms long on his head, and a child performs various acts on top of the pole while Sun moves freely below. This act is very dangerous. Afterward, Mr. Sun threw flying knives made of wooden chips. They flew in a circle of three or four fathoms and returned to his hand. The audience was very surprised, realizing that this was the same as the flying knives of swordsmen, but made of thin iron sheets. There are many extraordinary people with skills in the world, but it is a pity that we cannot see them more often. According to people, Western circuses teach animals more advanced tricks than Eastern circuses, and they can perform various movements. Eastern circuses, on the other hand, excel in human skills more than Western circuses. Mr. Lu is generous and extremely gentle. His theory of boxing returns to gentleness, so he highly approves of my theory of softening. He said that he should spend 100,000 yuan to buy an airplane to travel the world to promote female transformation and pacifism to stop killing. When he was in Siam, Xiao Fucheng gave him a poem and praised him as a "roaming knight of the divine land."</p>
<p>There are few tourists here. Not only is it impossible to find the drum book venues described in "The Travels of Lao Ts'an," but even the pavilion in front of the railing where people urinate, as described in "A Marriage to Awaken the World," is nowhere to be seen. There are only two or three boats. The area of the lake is so small that it is not as good as the back lake of Nanjing, which allows for paddling and leisurely enjoyment. Therefore, we quickly looked at it and felt bored. The next day, the scenery of Thousand Buddha Mountain was quite similar to Jiming Temple in Nanjing. Climbing the mountain and looking out over the entire city of Jinan, the city streets and houses are clearly visible, which is quite exhilarating. I wrote two couplets to show a glimpse. (1) "Springs gush from the earth, peaks surge, the land of Tanzi has an atmosphere, the seas and mountains are suitable for Du Fu's poetry." This couplet describes the scenery and also mentions the scenery. It is hung in the main hall of Xingguo Temple on Thousand Buddha Mountain. (2) "All forms are empty, cities, mountains, and rivers are like illusions, clouds and smoke pass before the eyes, the wealth and nobility of immortals leave no trace." This couplet can express our feelings when visiting mountains. It is hung in the front hall, and the rest are not worth watching. The so-called Thousand Buddha Mountain is a cave formed by the Jianyan cliff, with dozens of Buddha statues enshrined inside. This was added by later generations, and its original intention must have been different.</p>
<p>Jinan's weather combines the strengths of both north and south, not dry, not cold, not blowing strong winds, without long-lasting rain, the soil is yellow, and the water is very clear. Since the commercial port has prospered, the roads are quite tidy, and the market has a prosperous appearance. From my perspective, the various advantages of Jinan as the provincial capital surpass those of Nanjing.</p>
<p>News from the publishing industry. The Drama Monthly, edited by Mr. Liu Huogong of the Datong Bookstore, the tenth issue of the second volume, was published yesterday morning. It includes inscriptions by Sun Juxian, Ru Fuhui, Tiangang Shi, Zhou Chuan'ying, stage photos of Mei Lanfang, Shang Xiaoyun, Xun Huisheng, Zhang Wenyan, Wang Huilan, Hu Bilan, Yang Juqiu, Guo Jiyun, and others, "Pear Dimples Tidbits" by Zhang Cixi, "Notes on Listening to Music" by Feng Xiaoyin, the play script "Peach Blossom Village" by Hao Shouchen, "Golden Lock Record" by Cheng Yanqiu, and "Su Wu Herding Sheep" by Wang Fengqing, and dozens of articles on drama theory. It can be said to be a perfect compilation.</p>

<p>Chapter 12: Farewell Banquet, Holding Flowers to Leave a Beautiful Impression, Garden Gathering, Tea Tasting to See the Fragrant Posture</p>
<p>Among them were one or two philanthropists who had returned from abroad and had new ideas. They often encountered charitable relief societies abroad and saw that the wives and daughters of the upper class were always in charge. When these noblewomen came out to advocate, everyone would come to help. This is called "when you climb high and call, the mountains respond," which can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Although we have not had this kind of charitable relief society in China, the ladies in Shanghai are now much more open-minded than before. Taking the matter of foot-binding as an example, although the ladies in their thirties suffered from this customary pain from childhood, and many of their golden lotuses were unable to be unbound, they had to think of the next best thing, which was to wear round-toed, flat-bottomed shoes, or stuff a large piece of cotton into the toes of their shoes to make a pair of fake big feet, like the natural feet of girls of thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, or sixteen years old, which were also in the majority. Having suffered from the pain of foot-binding themselves, they would not allow their beloved daughters to suffer this pain again. Secondly, the number of girls studying in girls' schools opened by foreigners is gradually increasing. Chinese people advocate female education, and the number of female students in girls' schools run by themselves is also increasing year by year. There are even female bachelors who have graduated from abroad. It can be seen that the ladies of China are gradually moving towards openness. So why can't we open this kind of charitable relief society? He also thought that Shanghai is an international trading port, and if foreigners were involved in everything, things would be much more convenient. Those ladies living in Shanghai originally felt too idle, and they were very happy to be recruited to cooperate. In our association, there should be at least one or two wives of consuls or three or four mistresses of big bosses of foreign companies. Then the matter would be successful, and the momentum would be great. They have run such associations in their own countries, so they are naturally experts. Then the Chinese ladies, who have never run such an association, would naturally be guided by them and could become a respectable association. Of course, this matter must obtain the consent of the foreign ladies. Secondly, we need to think about the address for the meeting. There is no such big place in Shanghai owned by Chinese people. Borrowing a place from foreigners is not very decent. After all, it is for the charitable cause of the Chinese people. After thinking and thinking, I thought of Zhang's Garden. Only Zhang's Garden is a place owned by us Chinese people and is barely suitable. There is a lawn in the back that can be temporarily set up with many tents or reed sheds, like a garden party. By then, after decoration and with the electric lights shining brightly, it would look like a brocade of flowers. At this time, we must discuss with the owner of Zhang's Garden and get his permission.</p>

<h3 id="e285">Gold Standard Speculation Hidden Reversal <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>The trend was peaceful, hovering within the pass. Yesterday's (4th) gold standard situation was still stable, but the hidden softening had already shown signs of reversal. The previous market had five taels of small money, with twists and turns. The after-market only had a three-tael turnover, but the people's sentiment hidden within the 600 tael mark was stable. Foreign exchange slightly weakened, and the listed prices were unchanged. Inter-bank transactions were not frequent, and the cash flow of various firms was normal. Firms such as Yuancheng, Fuchang, Zhifengyong, etc., all made purchases, while Hengxing, Yuanmao, Yongtai, Kangrunyuan, Kangxiang, etc., mostly sold. However, the de-inventory was slow and unreliable. In the early market, the big bar suddenly saw a rebound and immediately broke through the 600 tael mark because of large household chasing. Sellers did not relent, and buyers retreated, making it difficult to sustain. The wind turned downward, and there was a sharp drop of more than five taels. At noon, it slightly picked up by two or three taels. In the after-market, various firms went in and out from time to time, and the price softened, with fluctuations of one or two taels. Finally, it stood outside 597 taels. The trend of foreign exchange bills was peaceful. Yesterday, British silver bars increased by one-sixteenth, and the price of silver also increased by one-quarter.</p>
<p>A short-lived surge then faltered. The opening price for August immediately fell by four taels and six qian, to 597 taels and three qian. The gross turnover fluctuated by two or three taels, retreating from 97 taels and eight qian to five taels and eight qian. An announcement was made not to move people's hearts, and it seemed good. Therefore, it reached 99 taels to 9 taels and five qian, and the internal situation was stable. The Bank of Japan bought one tael, three qian, four fen, three, seven, five, and recently one tael, three qian, four fen, half zhengjin absorbed six pence, two, five of British gold. Then, because of the sales from retail households, it returned more than two taels, totaling 96 taels and eight qian. After nine o'clock, the buying side rose, and people expected the foreign exchange to rise as well. The Bank of Japan bought Citibank's monthly flower at 36 yuan, five, six, two, five. Shanghai's monthly subscription was 36 yuan, five, six, two, five. Yuancheng Yongyuansheng chased up for more than ten minutes, jumping more than three taels to reach 600 taels, zero qian and one fen. In an instant, the selling side took the opportunity to sell, and a certain organization also sold, so it depreciated by more than five taels. The market atmosphere was shocked by this, and by eleven o'clock, it suddenly became 94 taels and five qian. Afterward, it returned to a stable state, raising by two or three taels. At eleven thirty, it was 97 taels, seven or eight qian. By noon, it closed at 97 taels and one qian. The announced price was still 663 taels, a small decrease of sixty-four or five taels. At noon, it was sixty-six taels.</p>
<p>The evening closed down four taels and six qian. The after-market opened at 97 taels and seven qian, then dropped from seven taels and nine qian to seven taels and two qian. Then, because retail investors bought in, it rebounded by more than one tael to 98 taels, six or seven qian. Because the Indian exchange rebounded, the people's sentiment seemed to be frustrated. At one fifteen, it was 97 taels and two qian. Suddenly, it was heard that the bank had taken in September British gold at six pence, one, eight, seven, five. HSBC and Datong did the following month's six pence, one, two, five, and Hengxing, etc., bought in, so it jumped up by two taels. Around three o'clock, it was 99 taels and a half. After a while, the sellers were still not quiet and retreated by three taels to 96 taels, five or six qian. Hedging bars also came to sell. Immediately, it rose by more than two taels again. Hengxing, etc., entered again. After three thirty, it was 99 taels. Then, Hengxing suddenly sold out, and the market atmosphere suddenly weakened. After four o'clock, it was seven taels and one qian. By four thirty, it was 97 taels and two qian, a decrease of four taels and six qian compared to the day before. The maximum price for the day was 600 taels, zero qian and one fen, and the minimum price was 594 taels and a half, a difference of five taels and six qian. The opening price for goods was seven taels and a half, the noon closing was seven taels and four qian, the afternoon was seven taels and six qian, and the closing price was eight taels. The announced price was still pressed down to sixty-five or six taels. The registered prices for replenishing water were 95 taels and 97 taels before and after the market.</p>
<p>Most of the hedging sales were sold. The transactions of various firms included: Fuchang, Zhifengyong, Fuyu, Yuancheng, Yongyuancheng all bought. Yongkang, Yongfeng, Wanxing, Shunli, Dadecheng, Yu Da, Yuanyu Yong had varying amounts of transactions. Taikangrun, Yuanmaoyong, Hengxing, Yongchengchang, Yuankangxiang all sold. In the afternoon, Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Linchangyong, and Fuchang all bought. Zhifengyong, Hengxing, Yu Da, Yuantai, and Futaiheng had varying amounts of transactions. Yuankangxiang, Yuanxingyong, and Fuyu all sold. The hedging was also mostly sold. Dalian firms sold more than 600 bars and bought 300 or 400 bars, which was quite flat. Guangbang firms had more than 1,000 bars, and the cash flow was roughly even because the sales and purchases were erratic.</p>
<h3 id="e286">Foreign Exchange Also Turned Loose and Discounted <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>Very Little Cash Flow from Chinese Merchants</p>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's foreign exchange listed prices did not change at all. However, the banks' buy and sell prices seemed to have loosened and discounted. From the early morning, it weakened and then stabilized. At noon, it loosened again. There was not much good or bad in the afternoon. As a result, British gold increased by 0.125 compared to the previous day, US gold increased by 0.3125, and Japanese gold fell by 0.0175, because the gold market showed a reversal and had broken into the 600 tael mark. However, the storm was still calm, with only five taels of turbulence throughout the day. There were few speculative transactions from Chinese merchants. Several tens of thousands of pounds of British gold were sold by Zhengjin, Mitsui, and Mai firms, and a small number were also purchased. Various firms also did five or six tens of thousands of pounds in interbank transactions. About 100,000 US dollars were traded in the gold industry, with Mitsubishi buying in Shanghai. As for Japanese gold, Chinese merchants sold several tens of thousands of yuan of recent issues, which were absorbed by Mitsui, Korean, and Zhengjin, etc. However, Sumitomo slightly sold. The market atmosphere seemed calm.</p>

<h3 id="e287">Silver Prices Suddenly Rebounded <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>According to a London cable yesterday, the price of silver suddenly rebounded again. It stretched and contracted alternately, making it difficult to predict. The recent price increased by 0.0625 to 15 pence, 0.625 (equivalent to one shilling, six pence and a half of British gold), and the forward price also increased by 0.0625 to 15 pence and a half. There were no special changes on the ground. India had a small amount of buying, and the market was flat. According to a New York cable, the price of American silver also increased accordingly, with the spot price rebounding by 0.025 to 0.3375. The British to American exchange rate increased by 0.21875 to 4.8646875 yuan. The American to British exchange rate increased by 0.15625 to 4.865 yuan.

<h3 id="e288">Foreign Cents Were High, and New Coins Sold Well <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview. Yesterday, the foreign cent market suddenly turned strong, with a difference of one cent compared to the previous day. The current market price has been hovering at this level for many days, and its fluctuations have always been one cent as the standard. Therefore, the current short side has almost no profit after buying and selling because there is no guarantee on the sales side, and no one has a standard on the supply side, causing the market to fluctuate and not be able to stabilize.</p>
<p>Cent Dismantling Price (Foreign Cent). The early market was 7 qian, 2 fen, 4 li, which was half a li better than the early market the day before. Unexpectedly, the noon market suddenly increased by 6 hao and a half to 4 li, 6 hao and a half. As a result, it was one cent higher than the previous noon (Silver Dismantling). The early market was 1 qian, 1 fen, a decrease of three points compared to the previous day. The noon market decreased by a small point to 1 qian. The bank listed price was four points divided head, plus water six or seven points.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market. Jiangnan small foreign coins were generally weak due to lack of sales. The early market was 6 qian, 2 fen, 7 li and a half, and the noon market was 6 li. Transactions were made at 2,000 jiao in the early market and 1,000 jiao in the noon market. The early market for Guangjiao was 6 qian, 1 fen, higher than the previous day's. The crazy rise could not be contained. The noon market fell by a small four points, but it also had a market price of 6 qian, 0 fen, 6 li. As a result, it was 7 and a half better than the noon market the day before. Transactions were made at 250,000 jiao in the early market and 175,000 jiao in the noon market. It was heard that the Dalian gang purchased several hundred thousand jiao of this Guangjiao spot goods. Copper coins also suddenly shrank by 5,000 wen to 390,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Incoming and Outgoing (Silver Funds). Yesterday, banks received and released 2.3 million of Huashang tickets, 1.6 to 1.7 million of foreign merchant tickets, more than 9 million of various freight taxes, and 1.7 to 1.8 million of special releases. 800,000 entered the warehouse, and 600,000 left the warehouse. Japanese banks received and released 4.4 million of various funds, 800,000 entered the warehouse. Qianzhuang and Yanggongdian received and released 39 million, 380,000 in division of the head funds, more than 800,000 in various road remittances, and more than 100,000 in cash. (Foreign Funds) The drafts and tickets made were 1.3 million and 3,000 in the early market and 1.225 million in the noon market. Only 47,000 banknotes were released in the noon market. 160,000 Zhongshan new coins were increased by 1.7 hao and a half in the market. Outside the market, there were 172,000 banknotes in the early market and 82,000 in the noon market. 120,000 Yuan coins in the early market were increased by 2 points in the market.

The total incoming and outgoing of foreign households of each bank was more than 15 million, and the incoming and outgoing of banknotes was 1.6 to 1.7 million. Qianzhuang and Yanggongdan received and released more than 4.2 million, and more than 210,000 foreign funds for division of the head. Borrowed foreign funds entered more than 100,000 foreign coins and 600 to 700,000 new coins and Yuan coins.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Bond Market Re-enters Sluggish Territory <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, bond prices have been fluctuating wildly, with no clear trend, indicating a very chaotic market. This is likely because the bond market environment is murky, and bond prices are merely reacting to temporary supply and demand conditions. Yesterday, large investors sold off, creating a sense of unease. Customs duties and disarmament bonds both experienced significant declines. Other bonds followed the downward trend. Specifically, the customs duty bond for this month fell by 1.5 yuan, the disarmament bond for July fell by 1.05 yuan, and the next month's issue fell by 0.8 yuan for both. Furthermore, spot customs duty bonds, which have seen little trading recently, fell by as much as 4.5 yuan. Demobilization small notes also fell by 2.1 yuan, with spot prices only slightly above 0.5 or 0.6 yuan. The total spot trading volume for the day was only 12,100 yuan. The futures market was flat as before, with a turnover of 8,170,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Sino-Foreign Cotton Yarn: Demand from Sichuan and Guangdong Remains Strong</p>
<p>Actual sales of cotton yarn are gradually picking up. Buyers from Sichuan and Guangdong continue to make purchases with relatively strong interest, which has somewhat strengthened market confidence. However, the overseas market for cotton yarn remains weak. Therefore, Indian and Japanese merchants are taking short positions during price increases. The majority sentiment in the market is that with the approaching autumn season, yarn sales are expected to improve. Additionally, there are widespread rumors of yarn factories stopping night shifts (although most factories are still profitable). Therefore, the current market tightness is difficult to reverse in the short term. If actual sales continue steadily, another increase of 1 or 2% is possible.</p>
<p>Open Bidding Prices Fluctuate: Human Bidding</p>
<p>The market opened with near-month contracts slightly down. As the bidding reached the far-month contracts, market sentiment stagnated. Large transactions occurred with second and third grade yarns for customer sales, which intensified market anxiety. As a result, prices for all months increased by 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan. In the afternoon, news of large purchases of spot yarn by Guangdong and Sichuan further strengthened market confidence, causing the opening price to jump by 0.4 or 0.5 yuan. A telegram regarding third-grade yarn caused a drop of 2 yuan, leading to a sudden market decline of 0.5 to 0.7 yuan. Ultimately, near-month contracts increased by 0.2 to 0.4 yuan, while far-month contracts decreased by 0.1, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 14,700 bales. Sellers included Yu Da, Mao Ji, Shen Chang, Xin Cheng, Chang Feng, Yi Long, and Yi Cheng, selling from 300 to 850 bales. Buyers included Yi Yu, Rong Xing, Tian Cheng, Da Chang Cheng, Shen Xin, and Da Feng, buying from 350 to 950 bales. The closing prices for human bidding are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Around 6,000 bales of spot yarn were traded. Spot yarn sales have improved, and buyers from Sichuan and Guangdong are very active. Statistics show that various buyer groups purchased a total of 3,045 bales, with domestic traders purchasing 3,375 bales. The market price is rising steadily. Buyers from Guangdong purchased 1,255 bales, Sichuan purchased 1,220 bales, Hankou purchased 200 bales, Yantai purchased 55 bales, Luzhou purchased 20 bales, Wuhu purchased 35 bales, Fujian purchased 20 bales, Shantou purchased 45 bales, Anqing purchased 40 bales, Xuzhou purchased 30 bales, Changsha purchased 50 bales, and other inland areas purchased 70 bales.</p>

<p>All spot sales have stopped. The cotton market is very weak. Foreign cotton is bleak and sluggish. Indian cotton is being offered for sale at very accommodating prices. However, no factories are interested in accepting it. Therefore, it is difficult for the local market to stabilize, and market confidence is very low. However, Hankou traders are acting very cautiously. Given the overall market situation, it is very difficult for the cotton market to stabilize.</p>
<p>Shen Xin and others sold 1,000 to 3,800 dan (a unit of weight). The Hankou bidding market opened with a loose atmosphere and a lack of buyers, with prices falling by 0.015 yuan across the board. In the afternoon, the cheaper prices of Indian cotton further eroded confidence, with prices falling by 0.015 to 0.025 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 42,400 dan. Buyers included He Shen, Tong Xing, Rong Xing, Yuan Feng, Shen Chang, Xin Hua, and Yi Cheng, buying from 800 to 1,200 dan. Sellers included Shen Xin, Yi Long, Shen Ji, Yu Da, Mao Ji, Yuan De, and Xin Cheng, selling from 1,000 to 3,800 dan. There were no spot cotton transactions.

<p>The long positions in Indian cotton have been liquidated. Yesterday, American cotton prices fell due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, good weather, and a decrease in buyers. Futures prices fell by 1 to 14 points, while spot prices remained unchanged. English cotton futures prices rose by 2 points, and spot prices rose by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. Indian cotton softened due to the liquidation of long positions and selling by sellers.

<h3 id="e292">American Cotton Cooperative Buys July Contracts Again <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>Market activity seems to be awaiting the new cotton crop situation.</p>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 3rd reported on the cotton market situation for the week: Trading on the cotton exchange has been very quiet this week, with only slight price fluctuations. There has been some short covering and some retail buying, reportedly due to high temperatures in the South and dry weather in central cotton belt regions and the northern border of Texas. The cooperative has also bought July contracts. It is rumored that the cooperative has taken delivery of a total of 170,000 bales of July contracts before the cutoff date. It is unknown how the cotton stockpiled by the cooperative will be sold in the future, but the cooperative has stated that it will not sell in a market with weak buying interest. Cotton merchants are now gradually becoming more bullish, but large-scale buying will only occur if there is a reduction in trade activity or a reduction in the new cotton crop.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was little trading in the market due to the upcoming national holiday and the government's release of the cotton acreage report on Tuesday. Therefore, some short covering occurred. Demand and sales of cotton, as well as trade in piece goods, are not strong. The weather is still good, and the cotton crop is progressing well.</p>

<h3 id="e295">Grain Shipments Obstructed, Flour Prices Plunge <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>All months fell by about 0.03 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was still firm in each month, with domestic traders maintaining a positive outlook, leading to a slight increase compared to the previous day's closing price. However, the market atmosphere suddenly changed dramatically in the afternoon, shifting from enthusiastic to bleak. The reason for the price decline was that the spot flour being shipped by Tianjin traders was suddenly blocked by customs for export, causing shippers to cancel their declarations (it is rumored that all grains and daily necessities are also prohibited). After this news spread, there was widespread panic, with the assumption that northern sales would be halted and that demand for flour would be difficult to develop for the time being. Under such circumstances, the market situation immediately faltered. Therefore, the current month's price opened at 0.25 yuan, a sharp drop of 0.035 yuan from the morning closing price. August and September also fell sharply at the same time. Subsequently, as long positions were sold off, market sentiment turned consistently bearish, and the market continued to decline. After observing the situation, it is likely that the decline will continue. Ultimately, August fell by 0.03 yuan compared to the previous day, September fell by 0.03 yuan, October fell by 0.02 yuan, November fell by 0.02 yuan, and December fell by 0.02 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e296">Wheat Futures Follow Flour Downstream <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>Over 2,000 bags of spot wheat were traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally flat, with only slight fluctuations compared to the previous day. However, the market atmosphere changed in the afternoon due to the suspension of flour exports. There was widespread speculation that flour sales would become more sluggish, and the need for wheat would also decrease. Therefore, sentiment for both near and far-term contracts inevitably softened. Originally, various factories had been thinking of lowering prices due to high costs, but now, taking advantage of this opportunity, the pressure to sell seemed to increase. As a result, the current month's price fell by 0.03 yuan compared to the previous day, August fell by 0.05 yuan, September fell by 0.04 yuan, October fell by 0.04 yuan, November fell by 0.02 yuan, and December fell by 0.01 yuan. Spot wheat prices reflected the fact that various factories were holding firm and unwilling to lower prices. Yesterday, 2,000 bags of wheat from various stores such as Hezhou, Shuangfeng, Shashi, Baoying, Pukou, and Zhenjiang were opened, and were purchased separately by small and medium-sized factories.</p>
<h3 id="e297">River Rice Increasingly Quiet <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, no rice boats arrived in Zhabei from the river. All registered stockpiled goods were subject to the risk of discoloration and heat damage due to the fluctuating weather. Therefore, there was an urgent need for assessment to avoid losses. However, the price assessment bureau still had over 1,000 bags of rice that rice shops had not claimed. Some of this rice had been assessed during rainy weather, so there was also an urgent need for shops to pay and collect it. Unfortunately, very few people came to claim it. Therefore, river rice assessment had to be delayed slightly, and the situation was quiet. Indicia rice was unavailable, and Meta rice became more sluggish. Market prices remained stable.</p>
<p>There was no arrival of Shanghai Northern or Southern Japonica rice. The exchange of Indicia Meta was slight and business was slow, and large plate sales were deadlocked. There was temporarily no distinction between Yangdu and Jian rice grades, with only slight increases or decreases for higher grades. Yesterday, there were also good reports on foreign rice, which bolstered market confidence. There was some inquiry in the main street, but due to the scarcity of goods, the situation remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Another report stated that recently, the price of Japonica rice in this port had soared to 24 yuan, but after the authorities limited it to 21 yuan, most traders from inner roads stopped shipping to Shanghai. Therefore, the stockpile of broken Japonica rice in the hinterland was slightly thicker. The recent harvest is right in the middle of the season of rice hulling and whitening, and every year most of the rice is shipped to Shanghai for sale at this time. However, after Shanghai’s market came to a standstill, except for a few goods merchants shipping to other ports and selling them elsewhere, the rest were all watching or preparing to stop hulling the Japonica rice, since unpolished rice is difficult to store for a long time. However, according to investigations, each rice shop in this port still has more than a month’s worth of stock, so there is no urgency to purchase more. In addition, Eastern new Japonica rice can be launched in the middle of the eighth month of the national calendar, and new Indica rice from the Southern and Western routes can also be seen on schedule, so the domestic goods merchants are gradually panic-stricken. Once the new goods are on the market, people will inevitably change, and the stagnation of Chen Japonica rice will be eliminated. This year’s Eastern new Japonica rice harvest is better than in previous years, so it is predicted that the price of rice after a month may turn sharply downwards.</p>

<p>Since the competitive sales of man-made silk from overseas, the consumption of raw silk by various silk weaving factories has decreased further. Yesterday morning, European and American silk telegrams came to Shanghai with extraordinarily small prices. Hua silk merchants found it increasingly difficult to sell off due to excessive losses. Yesterday, only French merchants and others supplemented their shortages. Xinfu and Hulin took in A-grade head yarns of 13 to 15 strips (sold in England and France), with 40 bales from the new factory at a price of 1,200 taels.</p>

<p>At most, no more than 12,000 to 13,000 bales of dried cocoons are transported to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Although the amount of summer silkworms raised in Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Huzhou, Jiaxing, and other places was smooth this year, they have been damaged by uneven weather, losing 60% to 70% of the crop. The amount of fresh cocoons produced is only about 30% of the usual yield. The cocoon market is coming to an end, and dried cocoons are piled up at various stations, awaiting urgent transport. Silk cocoon merchants are trying to get railway authorities to allocate cars. It is estimated that the total amount of summer dried cocoons transported to Shanghai from Zhejiang this year will be no more than 12,000 to 13,000 bales.</p>

<p>The Russian trading house is about to open.</p>
<p>Amid the slump in the tea market, since the director of the Russian Cooperative Association came to Shanghai to prepare for the resumption of business, Chinese and foreign tea merchants have paid special attention. The tea market has turned around, and the cooperative's foreign firm has been actively busy with internal arrangements and reviewing tea samples from various routes. According to news from the Russian side, the company plans to hold an opening ceremony for Gongxi tea and Shangzhou and Hubei patterned black tea next week. Although Zhenmei and Qihong tea are not urgently needed, telegrams have been sent to merchants for consideration. In light of the imminent opening of the Russian trading house, merchants in Wudong, Tunzhuang, and Gongxi began actively searching for supplies, and the market price suddenly increased by 10 taels. However, the market for green teas such as Zhenmei and Zhenmei, and Qimen black tea, remains unchanged.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market in producing areas telegraphed that the current price of Cuban sugar was still 1.3125, the New York sugar futures price for September was 1.33, and the December price was 1.42. Compared to the previous telegrams, each had risen by 0.03 yuan. The price for March next year was 1.51, an increase of 0.02, and the price for May was 1.59, also an increase of 0.03 yuan. The current price of Javanese sugar was 8.625, and the futures price for July was 8.50, both down 0.125. The price for September was 8.4375, also down 0.0625. Public Society coarse and white sugar imports and exports were slack, with asking prices at 7.85 taels and very few transactions. The stock of medium white sugar was very thin, with only sporadic transactions. The highest price for goods was 7.825 taels. Number 10 Dutch red sugar was 6.65 taels. The market was generally stable. The Japanese sugar market saw a slight decline. Bright China YRO mark was 8 taels, YT mark was 8.175 taels, Meiji goods were 8.2 taels, and Bright China YP mark was 8.4 taels. There were few transactions, and the market was generally sluggish. It is said that the Bright China factory opened the prices for 30,000 bales of YT mark for July and August delivery at around 8 taels per unit, which was still considered attractive based on previous additions, and was fully sold.</p>

<p>Recently, top-grade longan from various regions has been very scarce due to the lack of shipments. In addition, the listed goods have already been delivered, and only dozens of new items have arrived, resulting in a flourishing market that is holding off on opening. The inventory in the shops is also very sparse, so there are only scattered responses to customers. Based on the current market, it has risen by about 2 taels compared to the previous market.</p>

It is anticipated that the event will add a unique brilliance to the dramatic arts. "Qiu Bo Yuan" (Autumn Waves of Resentment) is an American film originally titled "Smiling Irish Eyes." It premieres today (the 5th) at the Odeon Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road. We are informed that its special characteristic is that American films seem to be emphasizing the ethnic or regional backgrounds of the leading actors. Indeed, American films have started to focus on depicting the actors' cultural and regional origins. For example, if Clara Bow is starring in a film this year, she often portrays her own regional culture from New York, and because she embodies the robust beauty of the modern American woman, she is usually cast in films depicting modern American life, such as "Wild Party" and "Good Sisters." Similarly, Dolores del Río, a Mexican beauty who went to Hollywood only a few years ago and hasn't acted in many films, is cast by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in films showcasing her own Mexican culture because she is Mexican. That film is called "The Bad One." But this particular trait is especially evident in the film "Autumn Waves of Resentment" that I want to introduce. As readers know, the lead actress, Colleen Moore, is of Irish descent. With an Irish beauty playing in a film with an Irish cultural background, the display of national spirit and the vividness of the regional color are naturally more authentic than, say, an American actor playing a French count. Moreover, Miss Colleen Moore is a qualified actress. The story goes like this: In a place in Ireland, due to the beauty of the scenery, a passionate man and a passionate girl grow up. The man loves music and plays the violin skillfully. The girl has a natural singing voice, and in the shade of the setting sun, she often sings like a oriole. Therefore, they are brought together by their shared love of art and their proximity. Whenever the setting sun reflects on the clear stream and the gentle breeze rustles through the flowers, they exchange warm feelings through song and strings. Their hearts resonate, and their feelings become uncontrollable. They embrace, lean on each other, and kiss. However, the path of life is always somewhat bumpy. That is to say, a drama needs conflict. So, into their peaceful and elegant life comes a third party, forming a love triangle. This love triangle disrupts the peace and elegance, adding much bitterness and sorrow, and much excitement and grief. The man's violin is smashed by the third party, indirectly breaking the girl's heart. However, a broken heart can be mended, and deep affection is the magic cure. A beauty cannot be forced, and the fruit of love is a weapon against stubborn enemies. Therefore, the girl shows anger and haughtiness towards the man's rival, but smiles and tenderness towards the man. This smile and tenderness in her eyes give the film its name. What follows is the sadness of separation and heartbreak, but tenderness remains tenderness. Although tears may flow, a smile is still offered, creating a symbol of life. The narrative of the film is that simple, but because of the strong regional flavor, it vividly expresses the Irish national spirit, evoking emotions and inner resonance in the viewers. Moreover, the clever director sometimes brings us to America amidst the gentle and exciting scenes, allowing us to enjoy the exotic charm of modern American life. Colleen Moore puts in great effort in this film, using her unique eye expressions throughout. She is inherently cute like a little bird, never being pretentious or overly enthusiastic, always maintaining her liveliness and innocence. What makes her especially endearing are the smiles in her eyes and on her lips, and the innocent charm of a young girl. In short, although she is a married woman, she is still like a child. In short, she is Irish. (Zhu Ben)</p>

<p>The Story of World Literature (1) (7) (5) by American Harnish, translated by Hu Zhongchi</p>
<h3 id="e309">Chapter 46: Scandinavian Literature <a href="#e309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>Modern Norwegian literature can be divided into three eras: the pioneers, the Ibsen era, and the new movement. The pioneers were the two poets Wergeland and Welhaven. Although neither of them did anything individually, Wergeland can be called the founder of Norwegian literature. He was an energetic and enthusiastic poet, an eloquent revolutionary, and can be described as the northern Rousseau. However, he never perfected his style, and his obscurity and obstinacy harmed his teachings and his ideas. Some of his lyric poems are extremely beautiful. After a busy career, he died young. Welhaven was a conservative, a champion of clarity and order. He attacked Wergeland's licentiousness with vigorous pamphlets. His struggle for stability and clarity had a beneficial influence on Norwegian thought and style. His authority is still great today, because he was above petty criticism. He was a poet, and his poems on ancient Norwegian themes established him as a classic of Norwegian literature. The Ibsen era includes Bjørnson, Jonas Lie, and Kielland. Kielland was a novelist with first-rate talent. Among the two, Lie was the more powerful writer. He was the leading novelist of the time. His first major work, "The Pilot and His Wife," made him the undisputed head of Norwegian novels. His novels were widely read at home and gained great fame abroad. Several of them have been translated into English. "One of Life's Slaves," "The Barque Future," and "Niobe" are his strengths. His strength does not lie in tense and amazing scenes, but in his calm observation of ordinary people. Ibsen is the greatest playwright of the past 150 years. No playwright in any country can doubt his prominence. In the world of dramatic literature, he is on par with Aeschylus, Shakespeare, and Corneille. This is not an attempt to compare them, but to show greatness. His plays are divided into two types: lyrical romantic and realistic. Poetic dramas mostly belong to the early period, while prose dramas belong to the later period. Among the poetic dramas are "Brand" and "Peer Gynt," which raised Norwegian literature to the level of the best literature in Europe. "Peer Gynt" is a fantastic satire that applies not only to the Norwegian people but also to universal humanity. It is a world classic, and its greatness is confirmed by Grieg's magnificent music. Ibsen's first realistic prose drama is "A Doll's House," in which a woman advocates for her own rights, rebelling against the old idea that a wife is a slave to her husband. This was discussed throughout Europe. Although "feminist liberation theory" is now an old story and much of the literature on the subject has faded, Ibsen's plays still have vitality. His next play, which aroused people's emotions, is "Ghosts," which explores the heredity of disease. This play has become somewhat outdated due to physiological inaccuracies. It received fierce attacks, and Ibsen retaliated fiercely with a play called "An Enemy of the People." Ibsen is often seen as a problem-seeker and a propagandist aiming to improve society. He actually has no such intention, just as he has no intention of opening a medical school or founding a new religion. He was originally a playwright who focused on dramatic effect. He only paid attention to society because society provided him with materials. This is clear in "Rosmersholm," where the problem is simply dramatic: the struggle between a weak man and a strong woman. Moreover, if the protagonist is played by an actress like Nazimova, it is a striking play. This is also clear in "Hedda Gabler." In "Hedda Gabler," there is no social issue, only personal entanglements. In his later plays, he became a poet again, not with the poetry of his youth, but with a symbolic approach based on keen thinking. This can be seen most clearly in "The Master Builder" and in the wonderful play "When We Dead Awaken," which ended his career. All of his plays have been translated into English by William Archer. Those who like spicy flavors and sound criticism will want to read a small book by another playwright, G. Bernard Shaw, called "The Quintessence of Ibsenism." Ibsen concentrated all his thoughts on poetry, drama, and the theater. His contemporary, Bjørnson, who was less talented, scattered his energy not only on all forms of literature but also on the complex political sphere. He excelled in novels and never surpassed his early stories of peasant life. "Arne" and "A Happy Boy" made him famous in many countries, just like Ibsen. He had practical knowledge of the stage, having served as the manager of the Christiania Theater. His plays are full of action and speed, and have many beautiful poetic sections where the author is not too impatient. His heroic plays based on Icelandic legends, "Sigurd Slembe" and "Sigurd Jorsalfare," place him among the great poets of the century. His comedies are interesting, and he has more humor than Ibsen, or at least more cheerful humor. His dual qualification as a poet and a political reformer led him to be criticized as a rebel. His passionate republicanism reminds us of George Sand. Ibsen, Bjørnson, and Lie were long-lasting and, even after their physical deaths, still guiding literary figures. However, younger people have arrived. Garborg, the son of a farmer, wrote novels in the farmers' dialect. He was not noticed until he wrote the startling work "Tired Men" in ordinary language. A delicate and excellent romantic novelist is Thomas Krag. His most famous novel is "Ada Wilde." A writer who is famous in his country and has recently been well received in English translation is Bojer, who combines romance and satire. However, the towering figure in the recent Norwegian novel scene is Hamsun. He has written forty novels, many of which are masterpieces. "Hunger" and "Growth of the Soil" are especially notable. He depicts the difficult side of life -- the word "vulgar" is not suitable here -- and he depicts it deeply. However, his depth is purifying and antiseptic. More importantly, he writes with a beauty that can be glimpsed in translation. Swedish literature has a long history, like Danish and Norwegian literature, which did not begin at any definite time. However, this tedious definition is possible: when Gustavus Adolphus revived the country to its highest military and political development in the seventeenth century, literature, which had been stagnant in the sixteenth century, began to flourish. In the same century, there was at least one great writer, Stiernhielm, the "father of Swedish poetry," who felt that his native language was rough and made it smooth, adopting many poetic forms. Another poet, Rosenhane, brought the Renaissance to Sweden with many short poems based on French models. During the eighteenth century, Sweden was a follower of French and English intellectuals in both prose and poetry. We do not see any great names in literature there, but there is one great name, although outside our field, that is not redundant to mention here: Linnaeus, the first genius in botany. As in other countries, in the eighteenth century, the Swedish literary ideal was academic and formal, but without the genius of the French and English pedants. And as in all countries, in Sweden, too, there was a reaction against the pedants at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The romantics were ultimately victorious. In the Swedish romantic movement, there was a great poet, Tegnér. In 1835, Longfellow, who was studying in Sweden, wrote, "Sweden has one great poet, and only one, and that is Tegnér." Longfellow's translations of Tegnér are interesting, poetic, and cleverly arranged with rhythm. Like most romantics, Tegnér saw rich material in the past, in the legends of his ancestors. His main work is "Frithiof's Saga," which spread his fame throughout Europe and earned him the position of bishop, which was completely unsuitable for him.
