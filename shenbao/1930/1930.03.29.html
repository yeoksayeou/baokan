<p>現時歐洲各國政局之不安定。皆起於財政問題。前已略論之。今者英政府得自由黨之助。略較穩靜。法則仍在一再打擊中。波蘭政潮。亦在醖釀。而德内閣則因無法維持。已以提出辭職聞矣。</p>
<p>以歐洲經濟全局論。各國方在聯合組織。藉關稅休戰會議之力。以調整全歐經濟。立一合作之新壁壘。又各以自國能力所及。整理内部之經濟。但皆在環境上感覺種種困難。不易如願。即以德國言。德於大戰後。首感困難者爲紊亂萬分之財政。於是即網羅全國政治經濟學者實業勞動各專門人才。特設一經濟會議。以審議整理經濟各方法。責成政府努力實施。此機關較無論何機關爲重要用能日漸進展。其復興之成功。實較日本震災之復興。更爲迅速。其最有效力之方法。爲盡量發展工商業。奬勵輸出。增進生產能率。又竭力使生產費十分低下。但因爲各種政費甚大。國家須徵重大租稅。工人又須改善待遇。增高費用。而運費又難減輕。故其結果。生產費旣難低下。而又當此貿易停頓金融變動之潮流。財政上遂釀成無法整理之僵局。今之失業保險費。特其一端也。</p>
<p>自歐戰以後。德奥經濟。均極困難。而奥爲尤甚。於是盛倡德奥合併之說。雖爲他種勢力所阻。而此志迄未稍衰。惟奥國前因屢起政潮。致合併進行。受一打　擊。今德國又因財政問題。掀起險惡之政潮。倘後繼内閣。不能迅速成立。糾紛早息。則於合併進行上。影響亦甚大也。</p>

<p>路透社二十七日倫敦電　各國總代表今日午後集議、倫敦海會至此、可謂爲已入一種新階級、海會當前各事、現已解釋明白、蓋專家工作已肅清某種實際上困難矣、法意間僵局仍爲談判進行之主要障碍、惟觀於法外長白里安日前在參院之温和演詞、尚使人抱一種希望、以爲此事或可解决、而海會唯一目的之五强協定、或可成立也、今晨白里安與英外相漢德森晤談頗久、聞在政治方面有所討論、迨午後各總代表將集會時、英相與日代表若槻互談片刻、各總代表之集會、歷時甚短、未提出政治問題、今日公報稱、下屆全體大會已决定下星期五日舉行、屆時將報告此後數日内各代表間談話之經過、及委員會工作之進行、各總代表將於星期一日再集議一次云、</p>

<p>建設不尚修飾</p>
<p>立法院長胡漢民、本月二十四日在該院紀念週上講演﹁建設不尚修飾、﹂其言切中時弊、茲爲節錄如下、</p>
<p>（上略）最近我們提倡節約運動、乃包含財力時間人才三項在内、除掉個人的節約外、機關團體也應當節約、機關中在用人上　在工作的時間上、部要考究適當不適當、有浪費没有、各機關的組織法上每每說、﹁某科某處的職員或秘書得用若干人至若干入、﹂這就是給我們一個節約的餘地　各機關斷不能隨隨便便地用足了最多數的人員、現在機關之中很多因求差的人衆、任情安插、有額便補的、好像把那些額子、補滿以後、才見得全機關的工作緊張、其實浪費之處、已不知有多少、至於用人不當、用非所學、學非所用、公私兩方的損失更大、去節約的道理更遠、那是更不應該的、機關内財力的節約、最要緊的一點、在母庸裝門面、重修飾、每一個錢總要用在實際上、門面差一點不要緊、例如最近的招待丹麥太子、似乎太裝門面了、即有背節約之道　再則官吏的自奉　都宜儉約　大家養成刻苦耐勞的習慣、這一層也是很要緊的、土耳其革命成功已經七年、而他們的首都思格拉、依然不見得怎樣講究、據兄弟前年所見、那裏人口祗有七萬多、祗新建了一條街道、政府辦事機關、因陋就簡的多、而辦事人員的革命精神、却很充足、舊都君士坦丁人口有七八十萬、幾乎多過恩格拉十倍、一切建築都非常宏偉、兩地相距、恰像我們的南京和上海之間　幾點鐘的火車便可以達到、但是他們政府中人并不貪戀君士坦丁的舒服、政府裏的大員並不以舊都爲休息之所、常常地去、大家終年在蓽路藍縷的恩格拉勤勞政務　時時刻苦自勵、爲人民謀解除痛苦、事事節約財力、而努力代人民造產、我們政府中一部份養尊處優、生活超乎一切人民之上的、所謂革命的官僚、對之應作何感想、凡只知有自已的享受、而不知有人民的疾苦的、豈是革命官吏、明明是腐化官僚了、官吏泄泄沓沓、人民又何從振作、上下交憊火</p>
<p>乃一種亡國的徵象、那裏是新興國家革命政府所應有呢、</p>
<p>說到修飾一層　不但爲節約運動所不容、而且是我們建設中所大　的　在我們的一切工作上　必須打破一個修飾主義　修飾主義一中於人心、凡事便舍本逐末、欺人自欺、就是建設了什麽、一定也用不得、甚至以後要重行建設都不會好了、我們還要明白、革命與修飾、是不兩立的　修飾有諱過的作用在内、諱過就是不肯改過、就是不革命、我們在工作上有了錯誤、不應諱言、不應粉飾、祗應自承和改過　如此一切才有達到眞美善的時候、現在政治工作、實際上已太差了、若不時還要忙着做面子、愽虛譽、因此便志得意滿起來、把實際的短處、格外丢在腦後不管、那就更糟、例如最近招待丹麥太子、原祗要盡一點國際問平常的禮節就够了、他不過是遊歴經過我國而已　有人說市政府因此拆去民間茅屋小房幾百間　兄弟曾經問過市府當局、他們說併無其事、兄弟亦願意其如此、如果不幸有了多少錯誤、那是應該賠償人民這種損失的　就首都說、我們很希望有此好的建築房屋與道路、供人民享用、但這事要我們平時努力、實際上做到那裏是那裏、母庸作一時的修飾、存個騙人的心、道路兩旁有着居民的茅屋、也不足爲羞、不必因爲在一二外賓之前有所掩飾、反敎許多居民流離失所、我們本應該努力做到人民不住茅屋、或旣有人民住茅屋　而因爲丹麥太子要來、事前蓋了瓦房、敎住茅屋的遷居到瓦房裏去、那也還可以自慰　若只求表面的觀瞻略好一點、而内部的痛苦却因此更甚、那又有何意義呢、我們的市政、與我們的一切政治工作、實在都無須如此　中國人民住茅屋的、甚至連茅屋都没有住的、南京固有、全國各地何處無之　我們看到民生如此痛苦、就該加緊努力、實現建設革命、如果不做切實的工作　而祗以修飾爲事、何與於革命、恐怕從前專制政府的修飾本領、還比我們高明、人民又要我們何爲呢　招待丹麥太子一事　就别方面看、我們還應有所認識注意之點、就是在我們革命者的立場上、對於國際間的禮儀、只須適如其分、而我們所歡迎崇拜的、却不定是普通看地位有資格的人　假如是一個大革命家大學問家大發明家、於社會人羣有實際的大貢獻的到我國來　我們政府對他特别的招待、正不妨比招待任何皇帝總統更爲熱烈而殷動、但一切也只重在精神上作誠意的表示、並用不着﹁掛錦在林﹂、﹁肥者應客﹂、種種修飾假套、這點意義、是我們同志所不可不知的、</p>
<p>若把修飾主義再移到社會上來觀察一下、便更覺可怕、最近有一位女同志來看兄弟、談起社會上情形、她說﹁現在服務社會的人、收入比往日加多了、可是各人的生活比往日更苦　問題更多、因爲家庭的用度、超過往日幾多倍、固然衣食住所需的物價、比往日高了、所以開銷大、而酬應上娛樂上的消費、比往日不知高出多少倍、幾乎與必要的生活費占着一樣的、乃至更高的地位　這是最不了的﹂所謂酬應娛樂、大半是表面文章　生活的修飾而已、大可伸縮、不應因他爲累的、兄弟已經屢屢說過、從前羅馬何以會亡國、近來德意志何以會復興、不是因爲一個太好修飾、跑到驕奢淫逸的路上去　一個事事求實際、常常在刻苦奮鬥中的原故嗎、我們現在要建國、要復興、羅馬的情形　是我們應該斷然爲戒的、德國的情形、是我們應該斷然取法的　照實際情形看來、我們興國的困難　未必比德國减少、而社會上尚浮文不崇實際的風氣、自來却與德國相反、豈不危險、</p>
<p>說到社會上的修飾病、就敎人要提到婦女問題了、那位女同志並告訴兄弟、上海南京店舖中所陳列的新式女襪　竟有貴至二十五元一雙的　其他可以想見了、這類東西、實在於我們國情太不相合、社會上發現了這種奢侈品、雖然服用的人是極少數　但實非社會之福　婦女的意志比較薄弱、格外容易爲物所誘、婦女没有受充分敎育的機會　而反有受充分誘惑的機會、其影響實在足以搖撼全社會刻苦奮鬥的精神、尤其是婦女本身正在求解放的時期　照這樣情形、從何解放起、如此所謂女權斷乎爭不到的、即使爭到、也惟有隨時失即、無從保持、女子不從學間上能力上事業上築好做人的基礎、而終不免注重表面的修飾、甚至以妝飾爲惟一的生命、那惟有做男子的玩具做物品的奴隸而已、舊式婦女在家庭内刻苦工作、還有相當的能力、新式婦女離開家庭、到了社會上、似乎解放了　但是没有服務社會的眞實本領　結果多做了社會的妝飾品、不但離解放的目的日遠甚至有形無形地終究做了男子的玩具而不自悟、廣東曾有某女子師範學校的校長、竟然甘心嫁給南洋某富商做第七個妾、聞者無不駭怪、原來她雖做師範學校的校長、實在没有多少智識、而生平震於物質的誘惑、早就不能抵抗　所以終於處了舊式女子所不願處的地位　反覺得是她的歸宿、豈不可憐可歎、</p>

<p>中央宣傳部頃發布告革命將士書、原文如下</p>
<p>民國十餘年來禍亂相尋　民生凋敝、吾黨總理蒿目時艱　領導革命、慘淡經營　積極奮鬥　垂四十年乃有今日、在革命過程中、賴我革命將士以强毅堅决之意志　忠勇奮鬥之精神、恪遵遺訓、共信共守、團結一致、卒將頑强龐大之殘暴軍閥、掃蕩殆盡、使我中華民國之統一得以告成　三民主義之和平建設、得以開始、此種光滎之偉蹟久已爲舉世所認識、而我革命將士所宜互相砥礪、永保勿替者也、</p>
<p>乃者統一告成、訓政伊始、軍閥之餘孽如　馮輩者、迭與腐惡勢力互相勾結　甚至有自暴自棄之徒、背去其旣往之革命歷史與人格、與腐惡勢力互爲聲援、伺隙搆亂、以謀傾覆我革命將士艱苦奮鬥所造成之黨國、馴致叛亂起伏、迄無寗日、而本黨建設之工作、亦受莫大之阻碍　言念及此　實爲痛心、我革命將士當知今日之黨國、乃我革命將士心血之所造成、斷不容任何反動的殘餘軍閥起而破壞、今日中央之一切政綱政策、乃根據總理之遺敎與全國人民之願望而實施、决不容任何反革命的勢力起而反抗、我革命將士於此、宜始終本其救國救世之血忱　遵從總理之遺敎、辦是非、明利害、擁護黨國、鞏固中央、則我革命將士之勳業與榮譽、必日益光大、蓋以年來反動殘餘軍閥滅亡之事實證之、凡擁護中央、服從黨紀者莫不昌、而抗違中央、拂逆民意者罔不亡、順逆之勢、即今日軍人成功失敗之所擊、此我革命將士所宜深喻此旨、共同勉勵者、</p>
<p>抑有進者、今日之和平統一、旣爲舉國共同之屬望、然和平非謂苟安、統一非求形式　唯眞正之統一、方能得實際之和平、唯澈底之和平、方能收統一之實效、本黨本三民主義以立國、唯能秉受總理遺敎、服從黨的使命者、方足與言和平、中央爲全國民衆之中央　唯能遵從中央命令、共謀國家建設者、方足與言統一、反乎是者、如認軍隊爲個人之武力　固非本黨統一之政策所能容許、而居心險詐、反覆無常、勾結反動、迭謀叛亂者、尤非我渴望和平之全國人民所能寛恕　是故凡以詭變權謀相競尚、朝秦暮楚、反抗中央、希圖割據者、不問其所假借者爲何種名義、均爲黨之罪人、全民之公敵也、（未完）</p>

<p>今屆　到了今年加入道項比賽的、還是中英蘇葡四隊、初賽時、由英對蘇、中對葡、四隊之中、以中英實力最强　結果、中國勝了葡萄牙、自不待言了、然而蘇格蘭竟僥倖勝了英國、於是最後的决賽、却是中蘇、蘇隊人才本來也不弱、不過不幸蘇籍能將很多的新傾士隊在不久以前、已經調駐印度却了、因此蘇隊乃此選才維艱之嘆、最近經度的磋商　卒定了一不甚强勁的隊伍、　　現决　我國軍呢、却是濟濟多士、不愁無一、誰都知道本屆大有可爲的了、到了昨日、令人望眼欲穿的中蘇决賽已經舉行了、這天是特别賽馬的第二次、天色晴明、出遊的人、當然多難、然而到足球塲去看這塲决賽的、比較到馬塲去看跑馬的却多了幾倍　三時前後、東西兩傍棚座裏　就萬頭攢動了、隨後到的、還陸續如潮至、結果高朋滿座　免不了頂攏起來、熱閙情形、却可想像得到、</p>
<p>列陣　隨後、蘇格蘭軍也到了、吾國軍是穿的紅白間衣、白色戰褲、蘇軍則籃衣白褲、藍白襪、雙方旗幟鮮明　豪氣冲天、同列一起攝影後、裁判員押乾臣一鳴笛聲、中國軍總司令林玉英、蘇軍總司令華倫泰、先行相見禮　而後兵戎相見、兩國列陣如左、</p>
<p>（中國）　陳錫培（中華）　黎郁達（中華）　李天生（南華）</p>
<p>林玉英（中華）　黄瑞華（中華）　何佐賢（中華）</p>
<p>葉北華（南華）　孫錦順（中華）　黄栢松（中華）　李惠官（中華）　曹桂成（中華）</p>
<p>（蘇格蘭）　羅渣（香港會）　柯林（警察）　食基路肥（九龍）</p>
<p>麥布賴（香港）　麥忌利維（警察）　基路奇賴士（香港）</p>
<p>士葛（香港）　華倫泰（警察）　符利沙（警察）　瑣備（海軍）　卑路（香港）</p>
<p>開賽　蘇軍先得地利、國軍乃開火、孫鐵腿一脚踢交葉北華、欲沿左路直逼蘇京、但右方鎭守使麥基路肥脚頭頑健、抵拒得來、蘇軍即乘勢由右路反逼、無效、這時候一鼓作氣、砲火犀利、炸彈連天、轟轟地響個不休、戰塲空氣、異常緊張　國隊左路先鋒葉、單騎前趨　三施射擊、但蘇軍壁壘森嚴、没由得逞、一次、右路先鋒曹、勇往前衝、近地傳中　惜中路黄孫互讓失機、</p>
<p>一球　惡戰一陣、你來我往、還是未决雌雄、厮殺約有百回合了、到底是吾軍利害、没有幾久、曹右翼疾走傳中、向蘇方要地落下、這時黄老將孫鐵腿也趕到了、還時老將不貪功、見球落下來、故意跳高、有心漏給老孫、孫鐵腿將軍究是百戰能員、把球截住、再射一脚、不高不低、疾如矢發、直向敵門去、蘇軍門將羅渣、焉能抵當得住、正如過眼雲烟一般、球已到了網底了、國軍先得了勝利、直至上半場將完時、曹右翼射進一球、可惜鳴金收兵、上場中國雖然射入二次、只作爲勝了一球罷了、</p>
<p>再戰　交換了陣地、蘇軍見前時不濟、把隊伍更改、中鋒符利沙退當右衛、麥基路肥改作正中衛、麥忌利維出當正前鋒、蘇軍先鳴鼓開火、欲想奪回城池、怎奈我軍兵强砲利、殺退他們不算、還着着進迫、蘇格蘭莫奈我堂皇大軍何、</p>
<p>二三　吾軍的機會又到了、曹右翼主踢角球、某將軍接射、中門上方柱木、反彈落地、本來這彈子是攻入敵門的了、可是不算數、然而到底有幸、黄老將得球一頂、鐵腿將軍再接應又一頂、卒于入了　國軍勝了第二球、不久、葉左翼銳進、符利沙奮奪、直至邊界、却給葉得回、輕輕交給老孫、孫左脚射、被擋出、不想右脚一起、球又入網、孫鐵腿第三次奏功了、</p>
<p>四五　中國隊勝了三次、還不算數、孫葉左輔翼互進、葉傳至右、曹走至一脚、可惜越出敵門去、隨後、黄老將牠再交曹右翼、曹再傳中、倒運的符利沙把手觸球、受最近射擊的十二碼球、林玉英主踢、羅渣擋出、但林再一脚、又打得勝鼓回、還有最後勝利、又是由黄老將交跌腿、在左翼地位射進的、直到完塲、國隊乃以五零殺至蘇軍棄甲曳兵而走、是役呵、中國大勝蘇格蘭、並開了個香港華僑新紀錄、</p>
<p>頒奬　血戰完了、無限光榮的國際杯、老早陳例在中入門處到了這時、萬衆觀戰團都圍到這裏來看熱閙、先由足球會書記荷蘭士演說一回、因爲吾國人太歡喜了、把他的語蓋住、不知他說些什麽、只聽得一句是﹁中國這回第一次得勝﹂而已、演完了、由華人代表蘇旭和夫人把那杯奬給林玉英、總司令唱號一聲、諸將軍三呼而散、</p>
<p>藝評　就事論事、中國隊這回破天荒爲華人開紀錄、得國際間之無限光榮、論功行賞、孫鐵腿將軍厥功至偉、然而合力取勝、十一員實各有殊榮、陳守門之堅持不使數人一逞、李黎之勇敢殺敵、三中衛之進助攻退助守、無瑕可摘、前鋒呵成一氣、更足可嘉、至于蘇軍、最劣的是符利沙、兩球之負、須任其咎、麥忌利維輩碌碌無表現、柯林頗足稱、啤路等已算盡其能力了、</p>
<p>尾聲　中國隊昨天爲中國增了無限榮耀了、昨日出塲的十一人、固然令我們嘉賞、然而對於初賽、以三對零戰勝葡萄牙的各員、我以爲也不可不再錄出、以紀其功、記得那時出塲的人、是守門包家平兩衛吳錦泉李天生、中衛梁榮德黄瑞華林玉英、前鋒曹桂成·陳少康·馮景祥·葉北華·陳光耀·不有初勝那有昨日的再勝、紀念功勞、兩華會似不能不雙雙奬勵、前次出塲盡出、昨日未再參加的各員呵、</p>

<p>— 思玄</p>
<p>十九年前之今日。爲吾七十二烈士殉難廣州之紀念日。其死事之悲壯。在民國史上。可永垂不朽。自吾黨統一全國後。而烈士等之名。相得益彰。孔曰成仁。孟曰取義。此之謂矣。烈士中以籍隸廣東者爲最多。福建次之。蓋粤閩二省。與歐美通商最早。僑居海外者最多。而受帝國主義者之壓迫亦最烈。於此可知二省人士蓬蓬勃勃之精神。而革命策源地之所以得名。非偶然也。茲將烈士等之籍貫統計於後。</p>
<p>廣東　四十一人</p>
<p>福建　十九人</p>
<p>廣西　六人</p>
<p>四川　三人</p>
<p>安徽　三人</p>
<p>若以縣别而論。則廣東花縣。已達十七人。花縣爲太平天國領袖洪秀全之故鄉。或烈士等之革命精神。受洪氏之影響歟。</p>

<p>我之革命。由心之所信而已。心信則爲之。徐錫麟温生才是也。無所謂約與不約。國中盡人皆是。即如張鳴岐李準及汝等。不過爲利慾所迷。甘作滿清奴隸。設使境遇如我。能保不爲革命黨乎。吾自行吾天職。以救同胞。若夫成敗。則天也。誰無死。何惜之有。（龐烈士雄供詞。）國事方殷。生民塗炭。吾人當以聖賢之心。行英雄之事。（劉烈士元棟語。）起義所以喚醒同胞迷夢。何謂倡亂。殺身成仁。古聖明訓。爾輩鼠耳。寗知大義。身旣見獲。其迷死吾。（陳烈士更新厲聲對清吏語。）大丈夫爲國捐軀。分内事也。我豈不能致富貴者。特不如爾輩認賊作父。不知羞恥耳。（李烈士德山臨刑駡監斬官語。）爾謂此舉爲壯士辱耶。事之不成天也。然已可喚醒同胞。繼志而起。爾等利祿薰心。血液已冷。寗足知此。（陳烈士可鈞叱清吏語。）吾與滿奴無可語者。（程烈士良爲李準嚴刑拷問。大聲駡如此。遂不答一語。）</p>

<p>— 孫欣俯</p>
<p>本埠愛多亞路南京大戲院。已於本月二十五日開幕。不佞辱承楊敏時先生贈以該院入塲劵一紙。得一瞻當日之盛况。歸來後。特將在塲所覩情形。拉雜述之於次。</p>
<p>建築古雅　該院外部。全用雜色之人造石築成。中復間以美麗奪目之磚。正面向北。旣入門。則有銀白色之古雅雕刻物。呈諸吾人眼簾。兩旁通樓下座。中爲石梯。拾級而上。北通遊憩廊。南通樓座。上下座位。均甚舒適。而關於調劑氣候寒暖之設備。亦甚完美。在樓廳及正廳之東側。復各有極大之休息室。塲内電燈。係採用隱光式。明亮而不眩目。總之該院建築。堪稱閎壯雅麗。身入其境。竟不啻置身羅馬皇宫中矣。</p>
<p>佳賓蒞止　該院定下午九時開幕。惟時屆八句半鐘。樓上樓下。已無虛席。如上海特别市市長張羣淞滬警備司令熊式輝。均携眷蒞臨。當樂隊奏黨歌時。則肅然起立。口脣微動。度亦在低唱黨歌也。　　小妹妹開幕　開幕之人物。係一對天眞爛漫而年事未滿十齡之幼女。身御淡紅色西服。並在截短之秀髮上。飾以紅色緞花。嬌小玲瓏。使人見而生愛。聞此一對小妹妹。乃徐妙玉徐妙嵩小姐。同爲名醫徐逸民之女公子。而徐君則該院之董事也。</p>
<p>滑稽歌曲　是日開映之影戲。劇名百老匯。乃美國環球公司最新出品之全部歌舞對白有聲鉅片。佈景富麗。情節離奇。歌女如雲。令人心醉。且歌曲甚多。大都悠揚動聽。而中有﹁雞生蛋或蛋生雞﹂一曲。尤爲滑稽。大意約謂蛋係雞生。雞自蛋出。然究係先有雞蛋。然後有雞。抑或先有雞然後有蛋。即大學畢業生。亦不能解决此項問題。男主角當歌此曲時。頭戴學士帽。手執司的克。狀殊滑稽。此滑稽之歌曲。譜以滑稽之音調。再加以滑稽之表演。遂益使聽衆忍俊不禁矣。</p>

<p>老鄉親孫菊仙。年已九十有一。而精神仍甚　鑠。去年爲益智館籌欵演劇。居然博得滿譽。今年有天津紅卍字會者。爲經費支絀。亦效益智館故智。請老鄉親大力帮忙。定本月二十七二十八兩日演劇籌欵。此老年事雖高。興復不淺。對於該會所請。一口應允。並自願演重頭好戲。以資號召。第一日日夜兩場。日浣紗計。夜魚腸劍。第二日全本四進士。並聞所定券價。甚爲低廉。樓下每票一元二角。包廂每間六元云。（日前本埠各小報。盛傳老孫有已來海上搭上海舞臺說。然詢之津友。則謂絶非事實。因附述之。以明眞相。）</p>

<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>高麗有一名僧曰水季南（譯音）者。現年五十六歲。精神矍鑠。容貌如青年。一得道之僧也。據其語人云。彼已數年不食粟矣。日僅啖松實三枚以爲活。自信能壽至三百餘年焉。三年前水曾至日本。謂東京貴族俱樂部中人曰。長壽無他道。惟靜心寡慾而已。余自得道以來。生活費用。日漸低落。至今已可不費分文矣。朝夕所進。松實三枚。清水一杯。所值幾何。言次且探囊出松實。則均爲吾人日常在山中所見者等。一囊松實。彼用之可度三月之生活。方今米珠薪桂之時。水亦幸運兒哉。</p>
<p>水在二十年前。尚在朝鮮日本政府中之外交辦事處充職。旣而又任兩大城中之警察巡查員。未幾。忽遇一高僧。傳得一佛敎秘籍。竟以得道。於一九一七年辭職而去。至深山野谷中。度其神仙生活。蓋水本爲虔誠之佛敎徒。平日研究佛宗。頗具心得也。據其語人。彼之長壽法。即得自此秘籍中所載。而爲其刻苦求得者也。佛敎始祖之後。得其道而長生。化仙以去者甚多。平均壽可至三百年。惟行之旣艱。久而失傳。以至今日天折者多而未聞有壽至二世以上者。水在山中苦修。已至十三年。平日無所事事。日惟以塑佛像爲樂。十三年來。聞已作成一千六百餘像。多爲佛書所載。而未見於人者。水之功德亦大矣。近聞其親友以及日本之信仰其人者。行將集資爲其築一寺於所居之山中。以供奉其所塑之神像。日人信佛素篤。此事或在意料中也。又聞水更將奮其餘力。搜羅佛經所載而久被湮没不顯之神。爲之塑像供奉。以盡其餘年。蓋彼自信尚有二百餘年之壽。不必自仲尼之再假我以數年而從事其工作者。志之以觀其後。</p>

<p>自名畫家鄭午昌許　徵白錢瘦鐵孫雪泥賀天健等。發起蜜蜂社畫展會一星期。來賓十分擁擠。餘興中合作扇面。尤爲顧客所歡迎。胡沛然劉鼎三等竟購扇十餘件。興致頗豪。殿以末三日之書展會。興復不淺。有已畫之扇。更求合作法書者。由任堇叔鄭午昌錢瘦鐵謝公展葉渭莘孫雪泥等。合作正草隸篆。最爲難得。統計十日。成績甚佳。閉會時由錢瘦鐵提議。將所剩畫件扇面。捐入慈善機關。爲衆人造福。經衆贊成照辦。鄭午昌提議設藝術演講座。遍聘名家。指授入社之後進。并設蜜蜂俱樂部。爲社員合作叙集之處。即日擬定章程。續行宣佈。聞入社者達百餘人。内有胡若思祇十五齡。而徐春錫年已七十七歲。一老一幼、在會對畫扇面。誠韻事也。比及散會閉幕。已漏殘燈施矣。歸而泚筆以記其盛。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十回　赤燄騰天勾欄欽孝女　紅毹貼地即席晤名伶</p>
<p>但是鳳雲心裏總有點不服氣。常常的冷言冷語。加以一種冷笑。伊本來是這房間裏的失意政客。他們也視伊爲反動份子一般。今天大家擠攏來要看這照片。看見左詩晨像煞有介事的樣子。要查騐他們的手指。鳳雲先是將嘴唇一披。鼻子裏一聲冷笑。說道。二少。那末讓我去淴一個浴。再來看吧。古人不是有接受皇帝的聖諭。要香湯沐浴以後。可以開讀嗎。左詩晨被伊鈍得口都開不出。說道。不是哪。看照片往往揑上兩個指紋。交關難看。我前天也是一張照片。給人家你也看。我也看。揑上了好幾個指紋。用橡皮也擦也掉。而且有人還要對着照片講話。纔唾濺在照片上。一點一點的也是很討厭咧。那時鳳雲早已撅着嘴。走開來。不要看了。含雲等較爲忠厚。說我的手指蠻乾凈。决不會揑上指紋。一回兒又商量要配怎樣的架子。掛在什麽地方。直等到十一點鐘。蕊雲方纔回來了。左詩晨那時心中想。蕊雲一定很喜歡看這個照片。因爲伊已經問過了好幾回。照片好了没有。怎麽有一個禮拜了。還没有印好呢。又說。我是知道的。人家都拍得很好。只有我拍得最壞。要是拍得不好。我寗可不要。詩晨却逗着伊笑道。你不要也不中用。人家都拍得很好。人家自然要拿的。你不能在人家的十二個人裏頭。剪去了你一個的。這樣一說。伊愈加發愁了。伊道。那末怎樣辦法呢。謝謝你。你可以給我想想法子嗎。左詩晨道。你放心。你拍得並不壞。我早已在玻璃片上看見過的了。不但是並不壞。而且拍得很自然。很寫意。伊說我自已没有看見過。不能相信。總要自已親眼看見過。方纔可以放心呢。可是現在晒出來。的確是拍得不壞。伊看見了這張照片。可以放心了。旣然拍得很好。自然看了很開心的。左詩晨覺得看見蕊雲的開心。就好像是自已的開心。因爲蕊雲每天到十一多點鐘堂唱出完了回來。雖然不免有點疲勞。然而是很愉快的。有時還是很高興的。因伊是具有一種活潑天眞的孩子氣。頗似日本人所說的﹁愛嬌﹂。伊有時滿面湛着愛嬌。一點不拘來的。而並不是什麽輕佻的。在那種有意無意問。似覺有一種純眞的氣品。却更令左詩晨想到在南京荒園中赤脚奔走的伊。</p>

<p>— 志靜</p>
<p>我校一大夏大學當局因鑒於學生擇業的困難、社會生活的複雜、想趁學生在没有離開學校之前　予以適當的指導　使他們在離開學校以後、對於社會生活職業生活能有適當的適應、同時、如歐副校長說到另一理由、他說、﹁如今學校、過重形式　學生以求證書而上堂、敎員以領薪水而授課、師生關係　止於一時、及其時過、即各一方、敎師不知學生、指導之責遂失、學生不明敎師、觀法之念無存　旣不相聞問、尚能有所訓導耶、然猶未止於此　比年以來、黌序鼎沸　學潮洶洶、甚至有以學生而毆敎師之事、即學生之殺校長者、亦非絶無僅有之事　師生之誼、蕩然無存、此其爲弊、可勝言哉、﹂所以就想到要倡行導師制、</p>
<p>大夏的導師制、是在去年上學期實行起的、當時由敎務議會的决議、聘定現任敎授二十一人爲導師　屬於敎務處、且祗就文理敎商各科之四年級生及高師科二年級生試行起、那時被導的學生、共計百七十餘人、由敎務處按照學生的科别系别以及生長的鄉土等項、以爲分配於各導師的標準、每導師擔任指導的人數　約十人左右、這就是大夏大學第一次的試行導師制、當時進行的程序、是先由敎務長召集了一個整個的談話會、說明歐美各大學導師制的沿革、及和平校施行的宗旨、以及應行注意各點、以後就分組進行、各組的辦法、略有些不同、有在茶話會中舉行的、有在聚餐會中舉行的、也有舉行　游會郊游會、而達其會晤與談話之目的的　至於談話的内容、講起來實在是煩複、眞是無所不談、身心修養　家庭婚姻、時事、畢業後的選擇職業、以及其他應有盡有、確是件件皆談、雖則也有相當的成績、但惜那時所施行的時間太促、祗有一個星期的將近畢業考試的時光、到了上學期、因有了一次的試騐　尚能差强人意　所以就决定繼續地進行、同時加以許多的改良、約略如下、</p>
<p>一、推廣導師制的施行範圍、從各科四年級推行到各科三年級　導師人數、也按照着比例而增加、</p>
<p>二、因感覺到導師制似含有課外作業的性質　所以由校務議會决議、改屬於羣育委員會、</p>
<p>三、經羣育委員會的討論、爲適合學生的心理起見、乃决定由學生自行選擇導師、結果、校爲踴躍</p>
<p>大概上學期所改良的　就是上述三點、而成績因時間的較久、故收獲亦較佳、</p>
<p>本學期開學未久、學校當局爲着滿足學生的需要、仍進行不怠　早就公佈出本學期應受導師制的諸生名單、且議决了三條辦法　照錄如下、</p>
<p>一、原有各組學生、除已畢業者外、仍歸原有各導師指導、本學期升級之學生、則令其自選導師、再行分配、</p>
<p>二、新生由各學院院長、各科主任、各系主任分别指導、</p>
<p>三、辦法、</p>
<p>甲、函知各院長、科主任、系主任、并附新生名單、請與新生隨時接談、乙、布告全體新生實行此項辦法、</p>
<p>因此、我們又可在同學的談話中、時常可以聽到互相告訴着、某導師的談論有趣、某導師的待遇優厚、甚至談到參加聚餐的時候、還會津津有味哩、從中自然也會找到許多的趣聞、待有機會時絡續報告吧、</p>

They are unwilling to increase troops into the customs to encourage internal strife. (2) The formal meeting is about to open. How the future will succeed or fail is still difficult to predict. In case the negotiations break down, they must still fully deal with the outside.

The Chinese National Government and organizations, as well as the people of your country, have generously and voluntarily expressed their goodwill to the people of this country and provided material assistance for the reconstruction project, which has been of great help.

<p>(6) The agreement on the recovery of the Tianjin Belgian Concession has been reportedly submitted to the Belgian Parliament, and Belgium is urged to approve it in advance. The approval procedures may be completed next month.</p>
<p>(7) Regarding the commercial treaty between China and Poland, the unclear points have now been clarified one by one. There is still one point that the Polish side still needs to request instructions on. The most difficult point is that the treaty stipulates a term of three years. The Polish government's opinion is to change it to one year. After repeated explanations from China, it has been understood and will remain at three years. The others are explanations of the clauses. It is estimated that it can be approved in another month.</p>
<p>After the report, the reporters asked Wang the following questions, which Wang answered one by one. The questions and answers are recorded as follows: (Question) Who will the Ministry of Foreign Affairs send to negotiate the Sino-Turkish commercial treaty? (Answer) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send Vice Minister Li to be responsible for the negotiation. (Question) Is the British Ambassador coming to Beijing this time to sign the agreement on the recovery of Weihaiwei? (Answer) The British Ambassador is coming for this matter. He can start signing after arriving in Beijing. (Question) To what extent have the implementation measures for the abolition of consular jurisdiction been discussed? (Answer) The British side has not made much progress due to the naval conference. The US side has not had the opportunity to negotiate because Ambassador Wu is currently in The Hague. Other countries such as France, Holland, and Panama have not given definite answers. (Question) How will the issues of expenses, fines, and custody of the Shanghai Special District Court be resolved? Will a part of the foreign personnel be used as bailiffs? (Answer) Regarding the issue of expenses, fines, and custody, the Chinese court will of course keep them itself. It is rumored that the right of custody will be given to foreigners, which is absolutely not the case. As for the selection of bailiffs, according to the agreement, the Municipal Council will recommend them, and the court will appoint and dismiss them. Of course, a small number of foreigners should be appointed. (Question) Will the Ministry of Foreign Affairs send Xu Mo as the permanent representative of the Shanghai Special District Court? (Answer) This matter has not yet been announced. It must wait until the other party designates someone before it can be officially notified. Although the Judicial Administration Yuan has designated Qian Tai as one of the representatives, it has not yet notified the other party. (Question) What about Yan and Feng's loans to the United States, Belgium, and France? (Answer) According to the investigation, there is no such thing. The US Ambassador telegraphed the ministry a few days ago and also denied it. (Question) Has the Dutch commercial treaty been negotiated with the Finnish government by Xia Weisong? (Answer) Since Zhu Shaoyang returned to China, Xia Weisong has continued to negotiate with the Finnish government. It is currently underway. (Question) When can the Sino-French Vietnam commercial treaty be signed? (Answer) France has changed its cabinet several times, so this issue has made no progress. Therefore, there is no hope of signing it for the time being. (Question) The Nepalese prince led troops to invade Tibet, and the Dalai Lama telegraphed the central government for assistance. The government has handed it over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Military Affairs for review. What is the progress of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on this matter? (Answer) Although China has no treaty restrictions with Nepal, it is a semi-independent country. Therefore, we should start with an investigation first. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has designated Lu Chunfang, the Consul General stationed in India, to be responsible for investigating the facts in India for verification. (Question) How is the abolition of consular jurisdiction progressing? (Answer) Mexico has recognized the abandonment. The Peruvian side can handle it soon. However, the key is still in the UK and the US, and in fact, it still depends on whether it can be implemented. When Turkey abolished consular jurisdiction, it went through two movements. Initially, it was unable to implement it and there was nothing that could be done. Finally, it was recognized by various countries and the abolition was achieved. When the Chinese government announced the abolition this year, it still left room for maneuver, that is, to wait for a suitable opportunity for implementation. (Question) How is the recovery of the concessions progressing? (Answer) It must wait until the consular jurisdiction is handled before starting to proceed. (Question) In the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement, Japanese newspapers reported that Article 3 of the agreement stipulates a special commercial relationship between the two countries. The two sides agree to special treatment for the 28 types of goods that Japan exports to China. What are the types and tax rates of these goods? Also, what is the content of the Sino-Japanese debt consolidation? (Answer) Regarding the consolidation of domestic and foreign debts, it was previously decided to set aside 5 million annually from the tariff increase for the consolidation of domestic and foreign debts. Since 1929, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has notified various countries that according to this type of debt consolidation, not only various countries are included, but also China. There is a rumor that the Nishihara loan has been recognized. I am responsible for stating that there is absolutely no such thing. The Nishihara loan has no evidence, so it cannot be established. It is most obvious. As for the issue of reciprocal commodity types and tax rates in the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement, there are only a few kinds of goods that the Ministry of Finance has studied and will add a certain amount within a certain period, and will not add any more after that. This method is not a price reduction. The Japanese side is also the same for me. Now that my country has announced autonomy on tariff issues, it is of course necessary to have scientific knowledge for the increase of tariffs on goods in the future. As for how the tax rate will be stipulated in the future, it should be handled by the Ministry of Finance. As for the issue of reciprocity, all countries have it very commonly, but what is emphasized is the word "mutual". In China's situation, the mutual benefit treaty will of course give me less benefits and them more. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has always considered reciprocity. When it was in Beijing, there were three principles: 1. The types should be few; 2. The time should be short; 3. The total amount of money should be similar. In addition, there is also one principle, that is, the maximum extent should not increase the tax rate. This agreement with Japan was negotiated based on this principle. Finally, the reporters asked what the Japanese Ambassador's mission was this time. (Answer) The Japanese Ambassador is here to discuss the issue of consular jurisdiction. Our draft has been handed over to Shigemitsu, etc. (28th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e31">Resignation of the German Cabinet <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The instability of the political situation in various European countries is all due to financial problems, which have been briefly discussed before. Currently, the British government has gained the support of the Liberal Party and is relatively stable. France, however, is still facing repeated blows, and political unrest is brewing in Poland. The German cabinet, unable to maintain its position, has reportedly resigned.</p>
<p>From a European economic perspective, countries are in the process of forming alliances, using the power of the tariff truce conference to adjust the overall European economy and establish a new cooperative barrier. Each country is also reorganizing its internal economy to the best of its ability, but they all feel various difficulties in the environment, making it difficult to achieve their goals. Taking Germany as an example, after the Great War, the first difficulty Germany faced was its chaotic finances. Therefore, it recruited political and economic scholars, industrialists, laborers, and various specialists from across the country to establish a special economic conference to review and organize economic methods, tasking the government to strive for implementation. This organization is more important than any other organization and can gradually progress. Its successful recovery is actually faster than Japan's recovery from the earthquake. The most effective method is to maximize the development of industry and commerce, encourage exports, and increase production efficiency. It also strives to make production costs very low. However, because various government expenses are very high, the state must levy heavy taxes. Workers also need to improve their treatment, increasing costs, and transportation costs are difficult to reduce. Therefore, as a result, production costs are difficult to lower, and in the current trend of trade stagnation and financial turmoil, the financial situation has resulted in an unmanageable deadlock. The current unemployment insurance premium is just one aspect of it.</p>
<p>Since the European War, the economies of Germany and Austria have been extremely difficult, with Austria being particularly severe. Therefore, the idea of ​​German-Austrian unification has been strongly advocated. Although it has been blocked by other forces, this ambition has not diminished slightly. However, due to repeated political unrest in Austria, the progress of the merger has been hit. Now, Germany is again experiencing a dangerous political turmoil due to financial problems. If the succeeding cabinet cannot be established quickly and the disputes are resolved early, it will also have a significant impact on the progress of the merger.</p>

<p>Actual Difficulties Have Been Cleared</p>
<p>The Franco-Italian Stalemate Remains</p>
<p>The General Assembly Is Scheduled to Convene on the Fourth of Next Month</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th - The chief representatives of each country met this afternoon. The London Naval Conference can be said to have entered a new stage. The matters before the conference have now been clarified, and the work of experts has eliminated certain practical difficulties. The stalemate between France and Italy remains the main obstacle to the progress of the negotiations. However, considering the moderate speech made by French Foreign Minister Briand in the Senate a few days ago, it still gives people hope that this matter can be resolved, and the five-power agreement, the sole purpose of the naval conference, can be reached. This morning, Briand and British Foreign Secretary Henderson had a long meeting, and it was heard that political matters were discussed. When the chief representatives were about to meet in the afternoon, British Prime Minister and Japanese representative Wakatsuki talked to each other for a while. The meeting of the chief representatives lasted for a short time, and no political issues were raised. Today's bulletin stated that the next plenary session has been decided to be held on Friday of next week, at which time the progress of the talks between the representatives and the work of the committee in the next few days will be reported. The chief representatives will meet again on Monday.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th - The next plenary session of the Five-Power Naval Conference is scheduled to be held on April 4. This is the fifth plenary session. According to non-official sources, British and French foreign affairs officials will form a committee to study the drafting of a Mediterranean agreement, if possible. This agreement can guarantee France's security, but it must also not bind the UK to obligations that can be included in the articles of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Nichi Ren, London, 27th - Briand, with full power, visited Henderson with full power this morning and talked for a long time. The British Party Bureau clarified the meeting as follows: "Briand, with full power, strongly told Henderson that France has always done its best to guarantee the mutual security of the League of Nations and the mutual agreement of the Mediterranean, and this kind of security guarantee agreement does not make the UK bear obligations beyond Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant." The US authorities stated their intention to join the agreement with the following two conditions: (1) The agreement is a purely consultative agreement, and in the event of a dispute, the participating countries must not bear the obligation of active mediation. (2) The agreement must not have the nature of compensation for France's reduction in tonnage.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 28th - Regarding the Japanese government's recall plan, the naval and foreign ministries are confronting each other. Both sides insisted strongly and refused to give in. The cadres of the two ministries also visited the prime minister to restrain each other. At the moment, there is nothing else to do but to wait for Prime Minister Hamaguchi to decide. It is quite tense. Depending on how Prime Minister Hamaguchi decides, it will cause serious consequences for naval ministry, the military command and other agencies of the foreign ministry and there is a risk of turning into a political issue. The government is quite棘手. In the end, it may make the Ministry of Foreign Affairs compile an independent case, consider the opinions of the Navy, get a certain case, and then report to the next cabinet meeting and ask for approval before issuing the recall.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Resignation of the German Cabinet <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Financial Bill Encounters Reef</p>
<p>Central Party Succeeds to Form Cabinet</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 27th - The German cabinet resigned tonight, and the resignation has been accepted by the German President. For the past few weeks, the parties in the government have been arguing over the reorganization of the financial bill, especially the reform of unemployment insurance, which is a reef. All the industrialists in the National Party strongly advocated that the deficit in unemployment insurance should be compensated by increasing workers' insurance premiums, while the Social Democrats demanded that the state raise funds to make up for it. Both sides insisted on not giving in. Finally, the Catholic Central Party put forward a mediation method, which was approved by the government, but the Social Democrats in the parliament still refused to compromise. At this point, the cabinet decided to resign in order to end the dispute. At present, the leader of the Central Party, Dr. Brüning, is the most promising candidate for the next prime minister. Although the rumors about his party in the parliament are different, it is roughly to exclude the Social Democrats. Currently, the faction in the National Rights Party is breaking away from the radical faction and joining the new party formed by the former secessionists to join the cabinet. If this can become a reality in the future, Brüning's cabinet can still occupy a majority in the parliament, otherwise it will be in the minority, and the length of its life will be in the hands of the Social Democrats. However, it is heard that the Social Democrats are not eager to force the dissolution of the parliament and re-elect it, and they will leave the responsibility of increasing new taxes to the middle-class political parties to bear.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 27th - The German government resigned today because the party leader and the government have different opinions on financial measures. Financial policy had been in dispute before the Young Plan was passed. Although the prime minister himself belonged to the Social Democratic Party, the Social Democrats in the parliamentary majority were very dissatisfied with the government's financial policy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 28th - Central Party leader Brüning is now organizing a new cabinet.</p>

<p>Debating the Young Plan</p>
<p>The Whole Place Was in an Uproar and Almost Led to Violence</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 27th - The French Chamber of Deputies debated the Young Plan today. Both the left and right wings wanted to postpone its approval. The right wing Marand said that the consequences and repercussions of the Young Plan could not be determined yet, so the case should be shelved indefinitely. The left wing Meyer and Herriot said that the government should not hastily submit this case to the parliament and force its approval. This is an insult to the parliament, and the deputies should have sufficient time to study the plan. The debate became more and more fierce, and the sound of accusations arose everywhere. Herriot said that the majority party standing behind the prime minister has always opposed the policy of peace. As soon as this statement came out, the whole place was in an uproar and almost led to violence. The speaker immediately announced a recess for fifteen minutes. Later, due to the absence of Foreign Minister Briand, a storm arose. Some people pointed out that it was a sign of discord between the prime minister and the foreign minister. Prime Minister Tardieu tried his best to refute it, saying that Briand was stuck in London due to the naval conference and was not absent because he opposed the submission of this case. Briand's opinion was consistent with his, and he also asked the parliament to approve the Young Plan as soon as possible, so that the first payment of the international compensation loan could be used. Finally, the Chamber of Deputies rejected the proposal to suspend the debate on the Young Plan by a vote of 319 to 262.</p>

<p>Causing Unemployment Problems</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th - Liberal Party Samuel raised the issue of cotton industry unemployment in the House of Commons today, saying that the Lancashire cotton industry is getting worse and worse, which can be seen from the decline in exports. India's trade has lost half of it. The production of Indian cotton cloth has increased under the protection of import taxes, and the import of Japanese cotton cloth has also greatly expanded. Although there is now preferential treatment for British goods, it still cannot offset the heavy taxes imposed by the government on British cotton cloth. Minister of Commerce Graham acknowledged the seriousness of the situation in Lancashire, saying that there are currently 154,000 registered unemployed people in the cotton industry. The committee investigating remedial methods will soon be completed and submit its report. The Indian government has stated that it cannot change the 15% tax rate on the assessed value of cotton goods, but it can add taxes to foreign cotton goods. Lancashire can be slightly relieved by this. However, there is now a revised proposal, and if so, the so-called preferential treatment will be deleted. The difficulties in Lancashire are great, but the government may not be able to continue to negotiate.</p>

<p>Coal Mines Bill Expected to Pass the House of Commons</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th - Former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Winston Churchill, stated in a speech in Epping today that the alliance between the Liberal Party and the Labour Party will endanger the Conservative Party. They seem to have reached an understanding to keep socialist members in office until the electoral reform bill is passed. At that point, the electoral law will be transformed into a form extremely disadvantageous to the Conservative Party and the interests of the Empire.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th - The Liberal Party has decided not to aid the Conservative Party's important amendments during the third reading of the government's coal mines bill, nor will it vote. Therefore, the government's coal mines bill is certain to pass the House of Commons.</p>

<p>To all newspapers, for your information: During our army's operations in southern Henan last year, for military convenience, we temporarily reorganized Li Yong'an, also known as Li Kebang, and his miscellaneous troops, who had long occupied the counties of Huangchuan and Gushi in southern Henan, into the Provisional Second Brigade of our army, ordering them to harass the enemy's flank. This order was not followed. In February of this year, our troops moved to Xuzhou, and we again ordered the brigade to quickly move to northern Anhui for reorganization, awaiting review and integration. However, the brigade commander has repeatedly disobeyed orders, lingering in Shangqiu and Gushi, engaging in extortion and exploitation, stopping at nothing. Recently, they even besieged Gushi, committing rape and looting, and secretly colluding with rebels, plotting rebellion. Such degenerates are beyond redemption. We should immediately revoke the original designation to prevent further abuses. In addition to reporting to higher authorities, we specifically telegraph this for your information.

<h3 id="e72">Hu Hanmin's Critique of Current Malpractices <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Construction Should Not Focus on Embellishment</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin, President of the Legislative Yuan, gave a speech entitled "Construction Should Not Focus on Embellishment" at the memorial week of the Yuan on the 24th of this month. His words hit the nail on the head regarding current malpractices. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>(Beginning omitted) Recently, we have been promoting a thrift campaign, which includes financial resources, time, and talent. In addition to personal thrift, government agencies and organizations should also be thrifty. Government agencies, in terms of hiring and working hours, must examine whether they are appropriate and whether there is waste. The organizational laws of each agency often state, "The number of staff or secretaries in a certain section or department shall be between X and Y people." This gives us room for thrift. No agency should casually fill up the maximum number of personnel. Currently, many agencies hire people indiscriminately to accommodate those seeking positions, filling vacancies as if filling them would make the entire agency's work more intense. In reality, there is an unknown amount of waste. As for inappropriate hiring, employing people in fields they did not study, or studying fields they do not use, the losses for both the public and private sectors are even greater, and it is even further from the principle of thrift. That is even more unacceptable. The most important point in saving financial resources within government agencies is not to worry about appearances or focus on embellishment. Every penny must be used practically. It does not matter if the appearance is a little lacking. For example, the recent reception for the Danish Crown Prince seemed too focused on appearances, which goes against the principle of thrift. Furthermore, the self-sufficiency of officials should be frugal, and everyone should cultivate a habit of hard work and endurance. This is also very important. The Turkish Revolution was successful seven years ago, but their capital, Ankara, is still not very elaborate. According to what I saw a few years ago, the population there is only over 70,000, and only one new street has been built. Government offices are mostly simple and crude, but the revolutionary spirit of the staff is very strong. The old capital, Constantinople, has a population of 700,000 to 800,000, almost ten times that of Ankara, and all the buildings are very grand. The distance between the two places is just like that between our Nanjing and Shanghai, which can be reached in a few hours by train. However, the people in their government do not covet the comfort of Constantinople. The high officials in the government do not regard the old capital as a place to rest. They often go there, and everyone works diligently on government affairs in Ankara year-round, constantly striving for self-improvement, seeking to alleviate the suffering of the people, saving financial resources in everything, and striving to create wealth for the people. What should the so-called revolutionary bureaucrats in our government, who live a life of ease and luxury above all the people, think about this? Those who only know their own enjoyment and do not know the suffering of the people, are they revolutionary officials? They are clearly corrupt bureaucrats. If officials are lax and indifferent, how can the people be invigorated? Up and down are exhausted.</p>
<p>It is a sign of national demise. How can it be something that a revolutionary government of a newly emerging country should have?</p>
<p>Speaking of embellishment, it is not only intolerable to the thrift campaign but is also a major obstacle in our construction. In all our work, we must break the embellishment mentality. Once the embellishment mentality takes hold, everything will be superficial and deceptive, deceiving ourselves and others. Even if something is built, it will definitely be unusable, and it will not even be possible to rebuild it well in the future. We must also understand that revolution and embellishment are incompatible. Embellishment has the function of concealing mistakes. Concealing mistakes means not being willing to correct them, which means not being revolutionary. If we make mistakes in our work, we should not avoid them or gloss them over. We should admit and correct them. Only then will everything achieve true beauty and goodness. Currently, the actual political work is too poor. If we still have to be busy putting on a show and seeking false praise, we will become complacent and ignore our actual shortcomings even more. That would be even worse. For example, the recent reception for the Danish Crown Prince should have been limited to the normal etiquette of international relations. He was just passing through our country on a tour. Some people say that the municipal government demolished hundreds of thatched houses and small rooms for this reason. I have asked the municipal government authorities, and they said that this did not happen. I also hope that it is so. If there were any mistakes, the people should be compensated for such losses. As far as the capital is concerned, we hope to have good buildings, houses, and roads for the people to enjoy, but this requires our usual efforts and practical implementation. There is no need for temporary embellishment or a deceptive mindset. It is not shameful to have thatched houses alongside the roads, and there is no need to conceal them in front of a few foreign guests, causing many residents to be displaced. We should strive to ensure that people do not live in thatched houses, or, if people already live in thatched houses, build tiled houses beforehand and have the residents move from the thatched houses to the tiled houses before the Danish Crown Prince arrives. That would still be comforting. But if we only seek a slightly better superficial appearance and the internal suffering is thereby worsened, what is the point? Our municipal administration and all our political work really do not need to be like this. There are people living in thatched houses, or even without thatched houses to live in, not only in Nanjing but everywhere in the country. When we see such suffering among the people, we should step up our efforts to realize the construction revolution. If we do not do practical work but only focus on embellishment, what is the point of revolution? I am afraid that the embellishment skills of the former autocratic government were even better than ours. What do the people want us for? In the matter of receiving the Danish Crown Prince, we should also recognize and pay attention to other aspects from the perspective of our revolutionaries. In international etiquette, we only need to be appropriate, and those we welcome and admire are not necessarily ordinary people with status and qualifications. If a great revolutionary, a great scholar, or a great inventor who has made practical and significant contributions to society and humanity comes to our country, our government may as well treat him with even more enthusiasm and diligence than any emperor or president. However, everything should focus on a sincere expression of spirit, and there is no need for "hanging brocade on the forest" or "fattening guests," all kinds of embellishment and false formality. This point is something our comrades must know.</p>
<p>If we extend the embellishment mentality to society for observation, it becomes even more frightening. Recently, a female comrade came to see me and talked about the situation in society. She said, "The income of people serving society has increased compared to the past, but everyone's life is more difficult and there are more problems because household expenses are many times higher than in the past. Of course, the prices of necessities such as clothing, food, and housing are higher than in the past, so expenses are higher, but the consumption on entertainment and social activities is many times higher than in the past, almost occupying the same or even higher position as necessary living expenses. This is most unbearable." So-called entertainment and social activities are mostly superficial and embellishment of life. They are very elastic and should not be a burden. I have repeatedly said, why did Rome perish in the past? Why has Germany revived recently? Is it not because one was too fond of embellishment and went down the road of extravagance and debauchery, while the other sought practicality in everything and was constantly struggling hard? We are now building a nation and reviving it. The situation in Rome is something we should resolutely guard against, and the situation in Germany is something we should resolutely learn from. Judging from the actual situation, the difficulties we face in building our nation may not be less than those faced by Germany, but the social atmosphere of valuing superficiality and not valuing practicality has always been the opposite of Germany's. Is that not dangerous?</p>
<p>Speaking of the social embellishment disease, it is necessary to mention the women's issue. That female comrade also told me that the new-style women's stockings displayed in shops in Shanghai and Nanjing are as expensive as twenty-five yuan a pair. Other things can be imagined. This kind of thing is really too incompatible with our national conditions. Although only a very small number of people use these luxury goods, it is not a blessing for society. Women's wills are relatively weak, and they are especially easily tempted by things. Women do not have sufficient opportunities for education, but they have ample opportunities for temptation. Its influence is enough to shake the spirit of hard work and struggle in the whole society. Especially when women themselves are seeking liberation, how can they be liberated in this situation? The so-called women's rights will definitely not be won in this way. Even if they are won, they will only be lost at any time and cannot be maintained. If women do not build a good foundation for being human through learning, ability, and career, they will inevitably focus on superficial embellishment, even taking decoration as their only life, then they can only be men's toys and slaves to things. Old-fashioned women worked hard at home and still had considerable abilities. New-style women leave the family and go to society, seemingly liberated, but they do not have the true ability to serve society. As a result, they mostly become decorations in society, not only moving further away from the goal of liberation but even unknowingly ultimately becoming men's toys without realizing it. In Guangdong, the principal of a certain women's normal school was willing to marry a wealthy merchant in Southeast Asia as his seventh concubine. Everyone who heard about it was shocked. It turned out that although she was the principal of a normal school, she really did not have much knowledge and had been shocked by the temptation of material things all her life, unable to resist it. Therefore, she finally found herself in a position that old-fashioned women were unwilling to be in, and she felt that it was her destination. Is it not pitiful and lamentable?</p>
<h3 id="e73">Open Letter to Generals and Soldiers from the Central Propaganda Department <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department recently issued an open letter to revolutionary generals and soldiers. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>For more than a decade since the founding of the Republic of China, disasters have followed one after another, and the people's livelihood has withered. Our party's Leader, Sun Yat-sen, keenly aware of the difficulties, led the revolution, managing painstakingly and struggling actively. It took forty years to achieve what we have today. In the process of revolution, relying on the strong and resolute will and the loyal and courageous spirit of struggle of our revolutionary generals and soldiers, adhering to the Leader's teachings, sharing common beliefs and守護, uniting as one, we finally swept away the stubborn and massive brutal warlords, allowing the unification of our Republic of China to be achieved and the peaceful construction of the Three Principles of the People to begin. This glorious achievement has long been recognized by the world, and it is what our revolutionary generals and soldiers should encourage each other with and maintain forever.</p>
<p>Now that unification has been achieved and tutelage government has begun, remnants of warlords such as Feng Yuxiang and others have repeatedly colluded with corrupt forces. There are even those who abandon themselves and betray their past revolutionary history and personality, echoing the corrupt forces, seeking opportunities to create chaos in order to subvert the Party and the country that our revolutionary generals and soldiers have painstakingly fought for. This has led to recurring rebellions and no peaceful days, and the construction work of our Party has also been greatly hindered. Thinking of this, we are truly heartbroken. Our revolutionary generals and soldiers should know that today's Party and country were created by the blood and sweat of our revolutionary generals and soldiers, and no reactionary remnant warlords are allowed to rise up and destroy them. Today, all the political programs and policies of the Central Government are implemented based on the Leader's teachings and the wishes of the people of the whole country, and no counter-revolutionary forces are allowed to rise up and resist them. In this regard, our revolutionary generals and soldiers should always maintain their patriotic and world-saving zeal, follow the Leader's teachings, distinguish right from wrong, understand the benefits and harms, support the Party and the country, and consolidate the Central Government. Then the achievements and honors of our revolutionary generals and soldiers will surely become greater and greater. The facts of the demise of reactionary remnant warlords in recent years prove that all those who support the Central Government and obey the Party's discipline prosper, while those who resist the Central Government and go against the will of the people perish. The trend of obedience and disobedience is the key to the success or failure of today's soldiers. This is a point that our revolutionary generals and soldiers should deeply understand and encourage each other with.</p>
<p>Furthermore, today's peaceful unification is the common aspiration of the whole country. However, peace does not mean seeking temporary stability, and unification does not mean seeking formality. Only true unification can achieve practical peace, and only thorough peace can achieve the practical effect of unification. Our Party establishes the country based on the Three Principles of the People. Only those who inherit the Leader's teachings and obey the Party's mission are qualified to speak of peace. The Central Government is the Central Government of the people of the whole country. Only those who obey the Central Government's orders and jointly plan the construction of the country are qualified to speak of unification. Those who go against this, such as those who regard the army as their personal force, are not allowed by the Party's unification policy. Those who are treacherous, fickle, collude with reactionaries, and repeatedly plot rebellions are even less forgivable by the people of the whole country who long for peace. Therefore, all those who compete with each other in cunning and scheming, are fickle, resist the Central Government, and attempt to carve out territory, no matter what name they borrow, are traitors to the Party and public enemies of the people.

<h3 id="e74">Zhang Guangwu Who Assassinated Wu Luzhen (Continued) <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to Ten Years Imprisonment by the Shandong High Court</p>
<p>(2) Submitting two types of evidence, 'The Qing History Romance' and 'Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty', briefly stating that the name and occupation of the assassin of Wu Luzhen were detailed in the above two books and had no relationship whatsoever with Guangwu. How could there be arbitrary slander, and so on. Upon examining the award certificates, it could only be proven that before the Xinhai year, the defendant had served as the battalion commander of the First Garrison Regiment, and after the Xinhai year, the defendant had served as an army officer in the First Division Headquarters. As for what position he held in the Xinhai year (the year the martyr was assassinated), there was no document to prove it. Although it was said that he had requested leave to return home due to paralysis, since there was no order approved by his superior officer, nor any official document of handover, it was not credible. If it was said that this was the practice, then why was there a stamped approval later for leave due to injury (injury sustained in Mongolia, attached to the file of the Taian County Court, reviewed by the Chahar Commander). Moreover, the month and day of requesting leave in the Xinhai year was initially said to be in October (see the county file), then said to be in August (see the transcript of this court), intending to evade the period when the martyr was assassinated (November of the Xinhai year). The statements were contradictory and the defendant could not explain himself. Furthermore, the defendant's troops initially belonged to Tie Liang and ended with Yin Chang (see the defendant's statement), and finally belonged to Yuan Shikai (see the Qing History Romance). The claim that Yuan and Yin were the instigators of the assassination of Wu had no impact on the defendant's suspicion of committing a crime. Moreover, it has long been the public opinion that the assassination of the martyr was instigated by people like Tie Liang and Yin Chang. Even if the defendant did not serve as a battalion commander under Yuan Shikai, it cannot be used as an argument that he did not assassinate Wu. His first counter-evidence was not sufficient. Further review of 'The Qing History Romance' and 'Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty' showed that they were both private writings. Although they were said to contain accurate records, they only revealed the main points. Furthermore, according to their contents, they were cross-referenced. 'The Qing History Romance' stated that the martyr was assassinated by his subordinates Zhou Fulin and Wu Hongchang, etc. 'The Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty' stated that the martyr was at the station with a certain Zhan drafting a telegram when a soldier Ma Zhongtian entered, congratulating Fu Jinxi. He then drew a knife from his boot and slashed directly. The martyr resisted from his seat and Zhan also shouted. Upon hearing this, the accomplice soldiers immediately entered and attacked in a crowd, cutting off the martyr's head to bring to Beijing, etc. It was clear that not only those who participated in the conspiracy to assassinate the martyr were numerous, but also those who carried out the assassination were in the majority. As for the names of all the people involved, apart from the ringleader, even if the author had investigated each one, there was no need to disclose them all in the novel. How could the defendant use the fact that only Zhou Fulin, Ma Huitian, and Wu Hongchang were listed, without mentioning his name, as an excuse to try to cunningly evade responsibility. His second counter-evidence was also difficult to establish. (3) The application of the law. The defendant, having been bribed, joined the assassination group and harmed revolutionary pioneers. His aim was to counter the revolution and organize groups or meetings and perform important tasks, which constituted the crime of the former paragraph of Article 7 of the Anti-Revolutionary Punishment Law. Although this law had not been promulgated when the defendant committed the crime, Article 13, Section 2 of this law clearly stipulates that if the crime was committed before the promulgation of this law and had not been definitively judged, it should also be punished in accordance with this law, and should naturally apply retroactively. The defendant also jointly conspired to commit murder, which violated Article 284, Section 1, Item 1 of the Criminal Law. Since the crime was committed before the implementation of the Criminal Law, according to the provisions of the proviso of Article 2 of the Criminal Law, Article 311 of the Criminal Law, which stipulates a lighter punishment for the crime committed, should still be applied. According to Article 74 of the Criminal Law, one act constituting two crimes should be punished severely. Furthermore, the defendant was merely a military officer who only knew how to obey his superior officers, which led him to be caught in the legal net. Moreover, when the assassination was actually carried out, there were other ringleaders (Zhou Fulin, Ma Huitian). The defendant was an accessory, and it was not appropriate to impose a high sentence. Based on the above conclusions, the defendant Zhang Guangwu organized a group and performed important tasks with the aim of counter-revolution, and jointly conspired to commit murder. In accordance with the former paragraph of Article 7 and Section 2 of Article 13 of the Provisional Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, Article 311 of the Criminal Law, the proviso of Article 2 of the Criminal Law, Article 284, Section 1, Item 1, Article 74, Article 292, Article 56, Sections 2 and 3 of Article 57, Article 64, and Section 2 of Article 6 of the Implementing Regulations of the Criminal Law, he was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for fifteen years within the scope of the original sentence. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined was counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days. The judgment was specially made as in the main text.</p>

<p>Asking Zhang Xueliang to Mediate the Dangerous Situation</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: After the attitudes of various parties were openly expressed, the situation suddenly became tense. Due to its strategic location, representatives on the Ping-Shen (Beijing-Shenyang) route arrived in droves. The Border Affairs Office Guest House, the Compatriot Club, and the major hotels in Kainingling were all filled with representatives from various parties, coming and going, and they were overwhelmed with guests.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Wen Shouchuan, who arrived in Shenyang a few days ago, came with a mission from Yan Xishan to contact Zhang Xueliang about everything. The importance of his mission can be imagined. I paid a special visit to Mr. Wen at the Border Affairs Office Guest House on the Third Jing Road in the commercial district today (the 22nd) to inquire about everything. According to Mr. Wen, he and Zhang Weiqing came to Shenyang one after another, both under orders from Yan Bochuan to contact Commander Zhang about the current situation. Yan initially decided to go abroad, but stopped at the urging of the generals of the Second and Third Group Armies. He had paid his respects to Commander Zhang twice. As for the Northeast's attitude, it has been clearly expressed in the Eastern Telegram. Now that the North and South are both at extremes, his mission here, in addition to his personal capacity, is to ask Commander Zhang to do his best to mediate and save the dangerous situation, and to realize peace. However, peace cannot be achieved with empty words. Now the Northeast is considering concrete measures to save the dangerous situation based on his request. Feng Yuxiang</p>
<p>Previously agreed with Yan before returning to Shaanxi, and the Second and Third Group Armies also have a considerable combination. As for the rumor that a government will be organized in Beiping, it is too far from the truth. However, the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force has indeed been established in Taiyuan, and may move to Beiping if necessary. He had already met Men Zhizhong, Feng Yuxiang's representative, in Shenyang. According to Mr. Men, the Northwest Army could reach Zhengzhou within ten days. Shi Yousan and the Second and Third Group Armies have also reached a compromise. He has completed all the matters related to his visit and will leave Shenyang for Taiyuan within two or three days. Zhang Weiqing will remain in Shenyang for the time being. (March 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e76">National Defense: After Liang's Death, Su Inherits the Border <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Su Bingwen Inspects the Manchurian Border</p>
<p>White Russian Rebellion in Shiwei County</p>
<p>Harbin dispatch, 21st: After Liang Zhongjia's death, the Manchurian border becomes vitally important once again. In the Northeast, everyone recognizes its critical significance. When Wan Fulin was in Liaoning, he repeatedly consulted with Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Zuoxiang, Tang Yulin, and other key figures. The final decision was to have Su Bingwen succeed as commander of the 15th Brigade, concurrently serving as the Hulunbuir Garrison Commander and the Commander of the Harbin-Manchurian Border Railway Defense Army. Su previously served as the commander of the 6th Brigade of the Fengtian Army, the 12th Brigade, and the 17th Division. In 1918, he participated in the Allied Powers' expedition to Siberia. He is now being transferred from his position as the Director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Defense Preparatory Office and Chief of Staff of the Deputy Commander's Office in Jiangsheng. He is energetic and capable, and willing to take on responsibility. Entrusting him with this vital border defense position is considered appropriate. On the 13th of this month, Su arrived in Hulunbuir to take office. The Manchurian border was quite unsettled after Liang's death. Su specifically ordered the 43rd Regiment of his troops to return to Manchuria Station to assist in defense. Therefore, the garrison at Manchuria Station, in addition to the two regiments of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, plus one regiment of the 15th Brigade, now numbers approximately 5,000 troops, which has stabilized public sentiment. On the 17th of this month, Su traveled from Hailar to inspect the Manchurian border, meeting with Chen Zhiyuan, the commander of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, to discuss defense matters. On the 18th, he spoke with representatives from various local sectors, expressing his own views, stating that he had a deep personal friendship with Liang and would continue Liang's ambitions to strengthen the border defense. His key principles for action are: (1) Openness and honesty, and vigorously eliminating corruption; (2) Selecting talented individuals and rejecting villains; (3) Strictly enforcing discipline and setting an example with his own conduct; (4) Not fearing death and not loving money; (5) Being loyal to the Party and the nation. As for the remains of the soldiers who died in battle in the Zhalan Man area, many have already been recovered, and Su will be responsible for organizing a public burial at a fixed date. Memorial monuments will be erected next to the Zhalan Nuoer and Manchuria Station railways, and prominent figures of the Party and nation will be asked to write epitaphs on them. Construction has recently begun and is expected to be completed by mid-May. However, the harassment by Russian troops on the border has recently intensified. On the evening of the 17th of this month, 29 Russian cavalrymen penetrated our army's defense line in Zhalan Nuoer, still attempting to plunder guns and horses. They were detected by our army and driven out of the border, with one of them captured. He claimed that their entry was to search for Soviet people who were betraying their country, but his other words were evasive. The next day, he was claimed by the Russian consul. Again that evening, Russian troops conducted artillery exercises on the border for about 20 minutes before stopping. The merchants and residents in our territory are used to this and are not very alarmed. On the morning of the 18th, three Russian planes circled the Zhalan Man border for half an hour before landing at Dawuli. Other demonstrations, seemingly intentional or unintentional, are numerous. Fortunately, the authorities instructed their subordinates to maintain calm, so no incidents occurred.</p>
<p>Shiwei and Qigan counties are mostly inhabited by White Russian immigrants. Since the Russian unrest last year, the clever ones fled, while the poor ones were lured and threatened by the Red Russians, obeying their orders to engage in anti-Chinese actions. The White Russians in Shiwei, those in Xiaohezi, Wulongtao, Haidolai, Geshenge, and other places, have mutually connected to rebel, and have set up tax checkpoints at Wulongtao and Xiaohezi, collecting taxes and inspecting Chinese. Chinese people traveling between the two counties and inland are often killed and robbed. The Shiwei county government has been moved to Hewu because of this. Two thousand miles along the border have been occupied by Russia in an invisible way.</p>

<p>The 29th is the 19th anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 Martyrs of Huanghuagang. People from all walks of life have scheduled a mass rally at the public sports field at 1:00 PM to commemorate them. The preparatory committee has already notified various agencies and organizations to participate at that time.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Industrial and Commercial Visiting Office has been established. Its operating expenses are estimated at over 4,900 yuan annually. It is planned to transfer the funds of the Zhejiang Branch of the National Goods Investigation Association for use. The Construction Department yesterday appointed Liu Yong and Wang Zhonglian as staff members of the office.</p>
<p>The Liangzhe Salt Affairs Audit Branch sent a telegram yesterday to the Wenchu General Tax Collector, stating that the post-war military expenses for the salt in Chu Prefecture have been approved to be reduced to 7.5 jiao per dan, and the military surtax has been reduced to 5 jiao per dan. All other salt fields are completely exempt. This will be implemented starting April 1st.</p>
<p>The price of rice in Hangzhou has been rising repeatedly. Top-quality rice is 16.2 yuan per shi, and ordinary rice is 13.4 yuan per shi. The source of rice is becoming less. Various rice shops have requested that the Rice Price Evaluation Council add 4 jiao to adjust the price. Yesterday, the council held a regular meeting. In order to take care of people's livelihood, it was decided to temporarily maintain the original price and then look at the market situation at the next regular meeting to discuss increasing or decreasing the price.</p>
<p>The seven porridge kitchens in Hangzhou City will be allowed to stop on the 31st. After the report is finished, the organization of the price-controlled rice sales will begin. There will also be seven locations and last for three months. The opening of rice sales is planned from May 1st to the end of July.</p>

<p>Minutes of the County Administration Meeting: The county government held its 51st county administration meeting on the 27th to discuss various cases. (1) It was discussed whether to approve the Construction Bureau's report on the reconstruction of Puzhao Temple Bridge. It was decided to approve it. (2) It was discussed how to deal with the issue of shop signs that cross the street both inside and outside the city and the two-step awnings of shops and households, which not only obstruct streetlights but are also related to fire prevention. It was decided that the county magistrate should instruct the Public Security Bureau's First District Office to persuade everyone to demolish them uniformly.</p>
<p>The Various Villages and Townships Under the County Repeatedly Report Robberies: After the neighboring Jinshan County was attacked and disturbed by bandits, robberies have been frequently reported in various places connected to this county. Bandits are as numerous as hair. Merchants and residents are panicked. At 1:00 AM on the night of the 27th, the home of Jiang Jing'an, a wealthy resident near Tangqiao in this county, was suddenly attacked by over ten bandits. Some held guns and other weapons, entered the house, and searched each room, losing no small amount of clothing and cash. Before leaving, they also shot and wounded the victim and left with loud cries. That same night, the home of Wang Shuqin in Dongwujiazhuang in Hengshan was also robbed by bandits. The bandits came by boat and all had firearms. Thirty dan of white rice were robbed, and one Yangcheng Lake boat moored at the river wharf was untied, loaded with rice, and escaped. Some say this gang may be from the troops of Taibao Ashu, so they paid attention to the boats and rice. It is said that it has not yet been reported to the county. Also, on the evening of the 24th, the home of He Guiming in Yangjiadu, Punan Shanyang, was attacked by over twenty bandits, each holding long knives, iron rulers, box guns, and other weapons, and lighting huge candles. They broke into the house and robbed the house, tying up all ten members of the victim's family, both old and young. He Guiming, his wife, and his second son, Wenru, were all wounded. The eldest son, Shuntang, heard the bandits enter the house and immediately jumped onto the roof, snuck to the neighbor's house, and shouted for help, and the bandits took the loot and left. It is said that 53 silver dollars, three gold rings, and cotton clothing were robbed. Today, the case has been reported to the Songjiang County Government for investigation and arrest.</p>
<p>Minutes of the Standing Committee of the Party and Government Committee: The Songjiang County Party Affairs Consolidation Committee held its 5th meeting on the 27th and resolved: (1) The price of rice has risen repeatedly, and people's food is worrying.

<p>Dear Editor, I read your newspaper's local communication section on March 16th, Fengxian, which contained a piece that says "All of the spring relief xiān rice has been transported," which is inconsistent with the facts. After investigation, our committee plans to sell price-controlled rice. The first phase is limited to purchasing 2,000 bags of forward xiān rice. Except for the first batch of 500 bags, which has been transported in mid-month, the remaining 1,500 bags have not been transported. Furthermore, the poverty quotas for each district have not been investigated, so the sale cannot be scheduled for the time being. I am sending this letter specifically to request that you please correct it. Sincerely, The Fengxian County Righteous Granary Management Committee, March 27th,</p>

<p>(1) The commemoration of the martyrdom of the Seventy-Two Martyrs on March 29th is a memorial day for the comrades of our party who, in the year before the founding of the Republic of China, on March 29th, sought to establish Guangzhou as a revolutionary base with a spirit of benevolence and righteousness.

(3) In commemorating March 29th, we should follow the bloodstained footsteps of the martyrs, strive to overthrow imperialism, thoroughly eliminate the Communist Party, the National Socialist Party, the Reorganization Faction, and eradicate new and old warlords who collude with reactionaries, undermine unity, and bring disaster to the country and its people. (4) In commemorating March 29th, we must awaken the people, support the central government, consolidate unity, work hard on tutelary government construction, implement revolutionary diplomacy, and complete the cause of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, which is sufficient to honor the martyrs and fulfill the responsibilities of those who come after them.</p>

This time, a large number of Chinese citizens from Osaka, Nagoya, Yokohama, etc., were prohibited from landing by the Japanese Maritime Police and escorted back to Shanghai. These included He Peigen, Xu Kangpei, Pan Jichang, Jin Yaoming (Jin, a student, was also prohibited from entering the country), Li Liren, Li Liquan, Ren Huida (all Fujianese, are kimono merchants), Weng Jikang, Lin Guo, Liang, Lin Yule, Weng Guifa, Lin Guangzuo, Lin Xuehua, Lin Zhenxing, Xue Wensheng, Li Junguang, Lin Xiaofu, etc., totaling more than 20 people. Most of them wanted to land in Yokohama to go to the Akasaka district of Tokyo. Japan, citing violations of immigration regulations, rejected them all. Everyone traveled back and forth in vain and suffered huge losses.</p>
<p>Travel Passports Are Difficult to Obtain. In the past, Chinese citizens traveling to various countries only needed a business to act as a guarantor to obtain a passport. Recently, the Foreign Affairs Section of the Public Security Bureau has announced that Chinese citizens traveling to various countries to obtain passports to travel abroad have changed their new rules. Whether traveling to Europe, America, or Nanyang Singapore, etc., when applying for a passport, it must be guaranteed by a statutory authority to be valid. Otherwise, the consuls of the relevant countries will refuse to sign. Recently, due to passport crackdowns, many batches of people have been prevented from traveling abroad and unable to leave.</p>
<h3 id="e98">More Than Thirty Organizations Oppose Japan's Exclusion of Overseas Chinese <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>More than thirty organizations in Shanghai, including the Special Municipality Stallholders, Brokers, etc., jointly issued a declaration opposing Japan's exclusion of Overseas Chinese, stating that the Japanese imperialists have bullied our country and harmed our compatriots for years. The facts and their brutality are already known to everyone, and even more so than other imperialists. The year before last, when our revolution was winning victories and advancing straight into Youyan, they disregarded international law and sent troops to Shandong, blocking our righteous army, killing our officials, seizing our property, and infringing on our national rights. Their violence and evil reached their extreme. Our people have endured humiliation and still have lingering pain to this day. However, new sorrows frequently come before the old hatreds are eliminated. The Japanese imperialists have recently become more extreme and more violent. For our citizens going to their country, they first make it difficult for them, then expel them, and do not allow them to land at all. It is already obvious and undeniable that they are disrespecting our nation, bullying our nation, and oppressing our nation. If our Chinese nation continues to be bullied, slaughtered, disrespected, and oppressed, and cannot enjoy the happiness of freedom and equality with other nations, even if civil rights are developed and people's livelihoods are prosperous, it will still lead to national subjugation and racial extinction. This matter concerns the foundation of the country and should be taken seriously. The members of this association vow to oppose it to the death and hope that all compatriots across the country will rise up together and continue to carry out economic sanctions against Japan to urge them to realize the situation. This declaration is hereby made for your consideration.</p>

A written request was duly submitted, requesting the County Government to review and issue an announcement to cancel the Tu Dong so that it could be posted for public knowledge, which would be a public convenience. After submitting it to the County Political Affairs Meeting for discussion, it was decided that the County Government would issue an announcement on April 1st to abolish it simultaneously with the Di Bao. It is hereby announced that all Tu and Di Bao in this county will be abolished on April 1st, which has been announced to the public.

<p>Three Finnish female missionaries, including Ka Jiangte, were kidnapped by bandits in Jiangxi Province without a trace. To this day, they have not been rescued. Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly consulted the Jiangxi Provincial Government to expedite the rescue, there has been no news. Therefore, the Finnish Acting Representative Wei Meiji dispatched Deputy Consul Ke Aili to Jiangxi to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already issued a passport to travel to the interior, which was handed over by the office. Yesterday morning, Deputy Consul Ke went to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to bid farewell to Director Chen Shiguang, and said that he would take the Wusong steamship to Jiujiang that day. However, he was unfamiliar with the geography of Jiangxi Province and unfamiliar with the route. Please telegraph to the authorities in Jiangxi Province to send personnel to guide him for convenience. It is heard that Director Chen immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request that President Lu be telegraphed to send personnel to wait in Jiujiang. When the Finnish Deputy Consul Ke arrives, it is hoped that they will guide the investigation.</p>

<p>Because the pharmacies in the Public Concession and the French Concession refused to mediate and settle unemployed workers, the slowdown continued today. On the doors of the pharmacies were stuck the words "The capitalists do not obey the mediation, the workers continue to slow down," and the capitalists also printed the approval documents of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, resolutely refusing to settle the workers. The police authorities, fearing that incidents would arise, sent additional police to protect the major pharmacies.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Student Union, in view of the re-emergence of the dispute over the settlement of pharmaceutical workers and the capitalists' refusal to accept the mediation of the Social Bureau, issued a declaration advising the labor side to consistently conduct orderly movements and the capitalist side to make sincere concessions, and to wait quietly for the party and government authorities to find a solution. In addition, the Shanghai Zhabei Water and Electricity Workers Union, the Steamboat Timber Workers Union, the Chinese and Foreign Cloth Industry Workers Union, and 32 other unions also issued declarations yesterday to support the pharmaceutical workers.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Important News About the Yangtze River Shipping Industry <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Continued Dispatch of Troops to Escort Ships. The upper reaches of the Yangtze River from Yichang to Hankou are currently in a period of high cargo volume. In the upper reaches of Shashi and the lower reaches of Yichang, because bandits are rising up, nine ships on the upper river have been attacked. The other day, the Jialing Maru of the Nissin Company and others were also attacked by bandits in the upper reaches. Yesterday, the various shipping companies in Shanghai received telegrams from Hankou stating that in addition to the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan dispatching warships to escort ships between Yichang and Shashi, twenty naval escorts will be added to each foreign ship to protect them. If necessary, the transport of passengers and cargo may be suspended. However, the Jianghe, Xianghe, Qinghe, and Shashi ships of Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire will continue to sail as usual.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Add New Ships. The Japanese Shangchuan East Company in the upper reaches of the river originally had one ship, the Changfeng Maru, operating. Recently, because the river water sometimes rises and falls, the company has specially built a new shallow-water ship in Shanghai called the Zhonggu Maru, with a load capacity of 220 tons, which can travel on the upper reaches of the Sichuan River. It is approved to be added to the Yichang route next month.</p>
<p>The Volume of Foreign Tobacco Shipments Increases Sharply. The Yangtze River ports have a very large outlet for cigarettes. Since the May 30th Movement, the outlet for foreign tobacco in the Yangtze River ports had fallen to about 200 boxes per day. Chinese cigarettes increased to about 1,600 or 1,700 boxes per day. By this year, since the Nanyang factory closed down, the export volume of Chinese cigarettes in the Yangtze River has plummeted. Recently, only 100 or 200 boxes are shipped. However, the export volume of cigarettes from British and American companies has increased sharply. At most, there are more than 3,000 boxes shipped to the Yangtze River ports every day. Recently, the average export volume is also about 1,600 or 1,700 boxes.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Great Competition in Sino-US Shipping Industry <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Merchants Add Six Ships. This year, the Sino-US shipping industry competition... Japanese...with 85 million yuan...nine...join this...operate within, and the Osaka Company also invested an additional 30 million yuan and is building six new-style fast ships with strong rates in Japan. Each ship has a displacement of 13,000 tons and a net carrying capacity of 8,250 tons. All use motor engines, with a speed of 17 nautical miles per hour. Special silk cabins are built in each ship, which can hold 750 tons, and cold storage cabins can hold 350 tons. These six ships will operate exclusively between Shanghai and New York, taking the fastest sea route, limiting the journey from New York to Yokohama to only 28 days, and to Shanghai in just 35 days. Those who used to have a flight every three weeks now have a ship every fourteen days. Taking Shanghai as the main port in the Far East, it plans to take over the ports of Tianjin and Qingdao in North China to obtain the right to transport goods in North China. The first ship is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on July 7th, the second ship is scheduled to operate on July 19th, and by December 4th, all six new ships will be able to sail. It is expected that there will be the most intense competition on the Sino-US line this summer.</p>
<p>Raw Silk Freight Rates Fall Again. Pacific shipping companies have reduced Shanghai raw silk freight rates to US$1 per piece. Recently, the number of direct ships to New York has increased, and the raw silk freight rates have also been reduced. In order to compete for transportation, the Pacific shipping companies in Shanghai, and merchants in other places, have requested that the water rates for Chinese goods to the United States be reduced appropriately. After investigation by various railway companies, the shipping companies have received a reply that from May 1st, the train transfer fee for Shanghai raw silk transported to the United States and transferred to New York in San Francisco, Seattle, etc., will be reduced by one-third from US$9 per piece to US$6 per piece.</p>
<p>Advising Japanese Ships to Join the Association. British and American shipping merchants operating in the Pacific have recently held several meetings with the heads of various lines in the Far East. They all believe that the Japanese shipping companies that do not join the association arbitrarily reduce water rates, which makes the business suffer. After discussion, it was decided to advise Japanese merchants Kawasaki and Mitsui to also join the association. If they agree, the fee for transporting American silk can be increased by three yuan per piece, but the Japanese merchants have not yet accepted.</p>

<p>The Anshan Maru, a small Japanese Osaka Company ferry, runs between the Puxi Wuma Road Bund and the Pudong Zhangjiabang Wharf. At around 5 p.m. the day before yesterday, the boat was on its way back to Pudong from Puxi. From the crowd of passengers, suddenly a young man jumped into the water to commit suicide. At that time the boat was moving quickly, and the waves were raging. The man instantly disappeared without a trace. The crew tried to save him but it was too late. The boat crew only found some belongings: a suicide note, a georgette jacket, a Central Bank 50-cent note, a five-cent airmail stamp, six copper coins, a small knife and several keys, and four pawn tickets. The items were temporarily collected by the crew and handed over to the Lujiazui Water Police for safekeeping when the ship returned to Puxi. They stated that the man had jumped into the river. The head of the police station ordered that the body be identified once it was recovered. The suicide note is recorded below (as it was, without edits) to reveal the reasons for the suicide:</p>
<p>To all gentlemen: Greetings. I used to work in a Westerner’s hotel. Last August, I met Zheng Meihong, a prostitute, at the Xinxin Garden, who lived at No. 243 Yulin Lane, Guling Road in the British Concession. Meihong and I fell in love deeply. By the end of the year, I had spent thousands of dollars on her. Meihong wanted to be redeemed because she was suffering at home. I spoke to Zheng, the madam, and the madam said she wanted $450 to redeem her. I offered $300, but the madam refused, and there was nothing I could do. This spring, on the eighth day of the first month, Zhang Liansheng, a regular customer of Meihong, met Meihong at the Xinxin Garden. She told Liansheng that she had no customers at home and was suffering every day, and asked him to save her. Because Liansheng had a wife, he couldn’t do anything. Meihong told Liansheng that she had a customer working in a hotel and that he could call him and speak to him. Liansheng called me six times to meet her at the hotel. On the ninth day, I went to the hotel and listened to Meihong’s suffering. I decided to help her out of conscience. On the tenth night, I had Meihong stay at the hotel and asked Liansheng to speak to the madam. Because Meihong was suffering, she didn’t want to go home. She told the madam to tell me that she had a customer named Chen who would take her away and that she wanted to speak to me at the hotel. The madam came to the hotel and said that Meihong didn’t want to go home and that she could go wherever she wanted. I thought that if something untoward happened, how could I live in this world with peace of mind? So I said that I would pay the same price as last year. The madam agreed immediately. On the eighteenth day, I paid her $150, with the remaining amount due on the eighth day of the second month. On the twentieth day of the first month, Meihong and I went to Hangzhou and stayed at the Qinghua Hotel. On the second night of the second month, I had to return to Shanghai for business and asked Meihong to stay in Hangzhou for a few days. When I returned to Shanghai, I lost my job, so I returned to Hangzhou on the third day. When I arrived at the hotel, Meihong was gone. I asked the tea attendant, who said that her family had taken her back. I immediately returned to Shanghai and asked the madam why she had taken Meihong back. The madam said that she had not returned to Shanghai and asked me who I was asking for. On the eighth day, the madam asked Hu Bingsheng, a gambler, to force me to sign a bond. I couldn’t bear it, so I signed a bond. Thinking about it, I had lost both the person and the money. I had lost my job, I had no money, and I had pawned all my clothes. I had no face to live in this world, so I jumped into the river to die. I hope all of you gentlemen will never patronize prostitutes. Written by Chen Baoshan from Shangyu County, aged 22, on March 25th.</p>
<h3 id="e123">The Case of the Customs Silver Box <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>A Silver Box Extra in the River Inspection Division</p>
<p>Moved from the Secretary's Office Next Door</p>
<p>The Box Surface Damaged by a Thief with a Saw</p>
<p>The Documents Inside the Box Were Not Lost</p>
<p>There was a case about a silver box in the office of the River Inspector Hallerman of the Jianghai Customs, Hankou Road, Bund, which was spied on by a thief. Fortunately, the box was very strong and was not broken. The contents of the box were various documents, not jewelry or treasures, so what was the use of it? This is a question. At present, the police authorities are secretly investigating. If the truth of this case is still unknown, it cannot be assumed. This incident was discovered on Thursday morning, the 27th of this week. The silver box was originally placed in the room of the secretary of Herr Hallerman, Gand. At about 6:30 a.m. that morning, the servant passed by the aisle and saw that the door was open and the silver box had been moved and transported to Hallerman's office. The surface of the silver box had been sawed by a thief. He was so shocked that he rushed to inform the person in charge of the customs and summoned the police to investigate. This case is quite bizarre, so the details are as follows:</p>
<p>The River Inspector Hallerman's office is on the fourth floor. There is a writing desk in the room, facing the entrance door. There is a convenient door on the left and a window on the right. Behind the window in the corner of the room is a large silver box. Next to it is a file cabinet for storing documents. Although the whole room is not very spacious, it is bright and clean, and the layout is well-organized. The office of Herr Hallerman's office is next door to his secretary Gand's residence. The two households are next to each other, and it is convenient to travel back and forth. The silver box that was lost was from Gand's room. Mr. Hallerman habitually leaves the office at about 4 o'clock every day after finishing his work. On the second day of the incident, that is, on Wednesday afternoon at about 4:30 p.m., he left his office and locked it. The next day, Thursday, the case of the silver box being attacked was discovered by the servant in the morning.</p>
<p>At about 6:30 a.m. this morning, a servant passed by the outside of Herr Hallerman's door. The double doors were open, and there was a silver box in the room. It was the one that had been moved from the opposite household. The box was about two and a half feet high and similar in width. It was black on the outside. The area around the lock handle of the box door was sawed open, but because the box was very strong, thick, and solid, it could not be sawed in, leaving only a deep mark. After the incident, the police station sent detectives to investigate, but they were unable to find any clues for a while. However, it was heard that the raincoat and mandarin jacket of a Chinese staff member in the aisle of the Tax Department office on the third floor below were also stolen. It is unknown whether it is related to the silver box case. All the things stored in the ill-fated silver box are documents, which are useless to ordinary people. After checking, nothing was lost. However, the police officers are convinced that the number of people engaged in this theft must be between three and five. As for what they intended to do, it is confusing and a dumb riddle in a hundred-foot-high building.</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, it was rumored yesterday that three iron boxes in the office of Customs Patrol Inspector Hillman were pried open on Wednesday night and many valuable documents were lost. The office of the Patrol Inspector is in the Customs Building on the Bund. How could his iron box be pried open? The matter is quite strange and is currently under investigation. It is said that this matter may not have been done by an outside thief.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Local Merchants Angrily Assaulted <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Arrogance of the Thugs is Sky-High</p>
<p>Wang Xiaoxizi is Inadvertently Injured</p>
<p>The Garrison Headquarters dispatched several civil servants at 1 p.m. on the 16th of this month to search the Gonghe ship at the Yihua Wharf in Hongkou and seized a large amount of opium and unrefined opium. The local merchants had escaped in advance, so they were not caught. Afterwards, the local merchants suspected that Wang Daxizi, a Jiangbei native, had reported them. Wang was a salesman for the Gongxing Salt Shop on Chongyuanfang Road, and he went to various ships to sell salt due to his job. When the staff of the Garrison Headquarters boarded the Gonghe ship to search that day, Wang happened to be on the ship soliciting business. He was suspected because of this. After the searchers left, the local merchants instigated more than a dozen thugs to insult and scold Wang, and they were about to commit violence. Wang, fearing that he would be embarrassed, endured it and did not argue, and immediately returned to the store. However, the thugs did not give up, and they went to Gongxing. At the signal of the leader, wooden sticks and benches flew together, and Wang was pushed down and beaten. The salt shop immediately reported to the Hongkou Police Station, and detectives He Xiaozhi and Ding Yugao rushed to the scene. Wang had already been seriously injured. The two detectives arrested the two leading thugs, Xu Tianfu from Zhenjiang and Qian Changfa, a local, and the rest scattered. The injured were sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the police sent the two criminals to the Provisional Court, and Judge Tan proposed to continue the trial. The lawyer for the plaintiff claimed that the injuries of the victim Wang Daxizi were very serious, his muscles and bones had been broken, and the internal injuries were even more severe. The hospital had scheduled an operation today, so the victim's life was in danger after the operation. Therefore, the victim came to court today with injuries and requested to be questioned first. Wang Daxizi then stated that the Gonghe ship was privately transporting opium and was searched by personnel from the Garrison Headquarters. I did not know about it, and I did not report it. Because I happened to be on the ship selling salt that day, I was unreasonably implicated. The thugs who committed the violence were all from the local merchant company. After being beaten, I have been receiving treatment until now, and I still cannot move my hands. At that time, the thugs beat me arbitrarily. Qian Changfa was also at the scene. Xu Tianfu slapped my face, and Tianfu's son, Xu Dagezi, was especially vicious and beat me the most. Then, the witness Wang Xiaosanzi testified that he had seen Xu Tianfu slap the plaintiff's face, and he had also seen Xu order the thugs to start beating him after slapping his face. When the defendant Xu Qian was questioned, the testimony was evasive. Lawyers Jiang Baoli and Fan Gang were hired to defend them. Judge Tan said that the defendants were heavily involved in the case and ordered Xu Tianfu to pay a bail of 1,000 yuan and Qian Changfa to pay a bail of 500 yuan for a retrial at a later date.</p>

<p>Chen Haosheng Fined 5,240 Yuan</p>
<p>French Police Detective Chief Shen Defu, Inspector Chen Sanlin, Detectives (?) Chen, Lu Yongxing, Mao Jinsheng, etc., seized four cases of Sichuan opium from the home of Chen Haosheng at No. 8 Zidelai Street, Li De Lane, who was secretly selling opium in violation of the ban. They went to Chen's residence according to the address the day before yesterday and seized four cases of Sichuan opium, weighing 262 pounds, worth 10,480 yuan. They were taken to the police station and sent to the French Court for prosecution yesterday. First, the West Inspector General reported the previous situation to the court and presented the opium. Chen was questioned and confessed to selling opium privately. Chinese and Western officials sentenced Chen to a fine of 5,240 yuan to be confiscated, and the seized opium was confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e126">French Concession Police Solve 20,000 Yuan Robbery Case <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Two Main Robbers Each Sentenced to Five Years in Prison</p>
<p>To Be Sent to Mainland Authorities for Further Trial</p>
<p>The Banque Franco-Chinoise branch at the east end of the Great World on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, on the morning of the 22nd of last month at approximately 8 a.m., ordered an old clerk to deliver banknotes and silver dollars totaling 20,000 yuan to a branch in the British Concession.  As soon as he left the door, he was accosted by several robbers who displayed pistols to intimidate him, seizing all the silver dollars and fleeing. This was reported in a previous issue.  Detectives Jin Jiulin, Wang Rusong, and Bao Tan Zhang Daorong of the special investigation unit of the French Concession Police investigated the whereabouts of the robbers and immediately arrested the robbers Xu Shungui, Zhou Bosong, female robber Qiu Zhou Shi, and Chen Li Shi, confiscating two pistols with bullets and 2,240 yuan in stolen silver dollars.  They were brought to the police station.  Later, suspects Shi Fengchang, Chen Xiaobing, and Cao Niao Ming were also apprehended. Yesterday, they were brought to the French court for questioning.  Chen Zhiquan, the manager of the Banque Franco-Chinoise, filed a complaint, recounting the circumstances of the robbery.  Subsequently, Western Detective Sergeant Salsil reported that the defendant Qiu Zhou Shi had previously been arrested for theft but was released after questioning due to lack of evidence.  When she was apprehended this time, two pistols were found in her room, indicating that the robbers, fearing searches by police detectives, used women to carry pistols when committing robberies, requesting a severe inquiry. Under questioning, Xu Shungui confessed that he was from Shaoxing, lived at 1092 Tongchun Lane on Broadway Road, and had no occupation.  Last month, while walking along Rue Louvain, he met a friend named Chen Fusheng, who invited him to a teahouse to talk about how to make a living.  Chen said there was an opportunity to commit robbery and asked Xu to find people.  Xu agreed and they parted. The next day, the 21st, Xu invited Zhou Bosong to meet Chen at the Dahua Apartments on Rue Paul Beau.  Two people named Liu and Jin were already there.  They went together to the entrance of the Great World and secretly waited.  They saw the old clerk taking the silver out.  Xu went home and waited until the next morning.  He saw the old clerk carrying the banknotes out, and Chen Fusheng and Zhou Bosong, acting as lookouts, used weapons to intimidate the clerk and seize the banknotes, firing a shot into the sky as a warning before fleeing.  Afterward, Chen Fusheng distributed more than 2,000 yuan in banknotes to Xu, who gave Zhou Bosong 40 yuan. Zhou Bosong's confession was the same. Qiu Zhou Shi confessed that she was a prostitute and had an affair with Xu Shungui for nine months.  Chen Fusheng had left the pistols at her place for safekeeping. Chen Li Shi confessed that she had an affair with Chen Fusheng for only three months and did not know about the robbery.  It is now unknown where Chen Fusheng has fled. Shi Fengchang, Chen Xiaobing, and Cao Niao Ming all confessed that they did not know Xu and were unaware of the robbery, requesting a clear investigation. Judge Zhu, after reading the police report and the defendants' confessions, which the defendants acknowledged, sentenced Xu Shungui and Zhou Bosong to five years in the Western jail each, to be deported and sent to mainland authorities for trial. Qiu Zhou Shi was sentenced to three years, to be deported permanently upon completion of her term. Chen Li Shi was to be deported permanently. Shi, Chen, and Cao were released due to lack of evidence. The stolen money was to be returned to the plaintiff, and the pistols were confiscated.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Film Censorship Committee Scheduled <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>To Censor Films in the Special District</p>
<p>Censorship to Begin on April 1st</p>
<p>The Municipal Film Censorship Committee, established by the Public Security, Social Affairs, and Education Bureaus based on the film censorship regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, has been censoring films screened in the Chinese area for five months. However, the committee, from its inception, had the goal of subjecting films in the special districts to the same censorship. Due to the special circumstances of the city, this could not be done simultaneously. After the "Fear Not Death" film incident, the committee felt that censoring the special districts could no longer be delayed. Therefore, it convened a temporary meeting on the 18th of this month, and invited representatives from the Municipal Propaganda Department to attend. It was decided that censoring films in the special districts would begin on April 1st. The measures are listed below: (1) Instruct all cinemas that, starting April 1st, film advertisements must state "This film has been approved for public screening by the Shanghai Municipal Film Censorship Committee." Films that have not been censored will not be allowed to be advertised. (2) The Municipal Party Headquarters and the Film Censorship Committee will send letters to all newspapers stating that, starting April 1st, film advertisements without the above statement should not be published. (3) If any film uses the phrase "has been censored" without actually having been censored, in addition to asking the newspaper to remove the advertisement the next day, the application to censor the film will not be accepted.</p>

<p>Within the Fanwangdu Park</p>
<p>The Wenhui Bao reports that recently, a Westerner, Ai Qingbaomu, applied to the Public Works Department for permission to build a swimming pool and dance hall in Fanwangdu Park. The department, considering the park to be public property, found it inconvenient to allow private individuals to conduct such business and rejected the application.</p>

<p>Amendment to the Route of the French Water Pipe Signal Line</p>
<p>The French Tramway and Electricity Company signed a contract with the Municipal Government on March 22 of last year to lay a No. 4 water pipe in the Chinese area. Article 2 of the contract stipulated that an electrical signal line could be laid along the water pipe to transmit the water level of the French Concession water towers and reservoirs to the Xiaojia Factory water plant. Now, the company stated that if the line followed the water pipe route exactly, it would have to cross the French Concession, taking the route of Rue Louvain, Rue Comte, Rue Luban, and then entering the factory, which would be a long route. If, at the intersection of Sanguantang Road and Lujiabang, it separated from the new water pipe and followed the existing No. 2 water pipe along Lujiabang Road, entering the French Concession at Xieqiao and going straight to the Lujiiawan General Factory via Xujiahui Road, it would shorten the length and save on road excavation work. They sent a letter to the Municipal Public Works Bureau asking for permission to change the route and stated that they were willing to bear all road excavation fees for digging Lujiabang Road. The bureau checked the request and found that, although it changed the terms of the contract, it was not without reason. Therefore, it sought the consent of the Land Bureau and the Public Works Bureau and jointly submitted it to the Municipal Government. It is now known that the Municipal Government has instructed that the approval be granted.</p>

<p>Investigation of Reconciliation Records Required</p>
<p>A Monk and a Nun Must Appear in Court</p>
<p>The case of Zhang Wenqing, the daughter of a deceased official from Huzhou, colluding with Chen Hengcai, the son of her family's maid, and Yao Yonggui and Gao Jintang to kill her stepmother Zhang Su Shi has been widely publicized throughout Shanghai. The courtroom has been crowded for every hearing. The case had already concluded its arguments, and the final sentencing was originally scheduled for yesterday morning. Those concerned about the case all got up especially early yesterday and went to observe. At the ninth stroke of the bell, the second court of the Provisional Court was already full. Half an hour later, it felt even more crowded. Suddenly, Judge Luo Renji ascended to the bench and ordered the four defendants, Zhang Wenqing and others, to stand at the defendant's position. At this moment, the courtroom was silent and solemn, listening to this final five-minute judgment. Judge Luo then declared that the case was originally scheduled for sentencing today, but after examination, it was found that the reconciliation records of the deceased and the first wife in the lawsuit still needed to be investigated, so the judgment could not be announced today. Judge Luo then questioned Zhang Wenqing about the dharma name and address of the monk who participated in the reconciliation. Zhang confessed that there was a monk and a nun who mediated at the time, and the reconciliation record was made by the monk, whose name was Yushan, the abbot of Conglin Temple in Yangzhou, and the nun's name was Genshan, who lived at the Tongshan Hall on Carter Road in this city. He then briefly questioned Chen Hengcai and Gao Jintang a few more times, instructing them to be remanded into custody separately and to summon the two witnesses, Yushan and Genshan, to court on the afternoon of April 7 for cross-examination, and ordered a re-opening of arguments. The audience then dispersed, and the case will have to go through another round of arguments before a date for the final judgment can be set.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Record of the Trial of the Kidnapping of Brothers Case <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Xi Xiangquan and Xi Xianglin</p>
<p>Shen Xinyi and Tan Xinglou</p>
<p>On September 22 of last year, a bizarre kidnapping case occurred in Nanhui County. Xi Xiangquan, a wealthy landowner, was kidnapped and later released for a ransom of 7,000 yuan. The case implicated college student Shen Xinyi, his brother-in-law Tan Xinglou, and Xi Xiangquan's elder brother Xi Xianglin, who were arrested by the county public security bureau and subjected to torture. Shen and others refused to accept this and filed complaints with the provincial government's civil affairs department, the high court, and the judicial yuan, accusing the former Nanhui County magistrate Shen Zhizhong of illegal dereliction of duty and the former public security bureau chief Cao Yongqi of abusing torture. The high court then assigned the Shanghai District Court to investigate and handle the case. A trial was held but not concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian convened another hearing. First, the kidnapped person Xi Xiangquan testified that on the night of September 22 last year, he suddenly heard Tan Xinglou calling at the door. At that time, I had already turned off the lights and was sleeping in the accounting room. I put on my clothes and went out to see about twenty people, each holding a pistol and a flashlight, who dragged me to the field corner and blindfolded me. (Question) Do you know Shen Xinyi? (Answer) I don't know him, but Tan Xinglou often comes to my house. Next, Xi's mother, Xi Yangshi, testified that Xianglin and Xiangquan are both my sons. I am deaf and blind. When Xiangquan was kidnapped, I was pressed to the ground by a group of people and covered with a quilt, unable to call for help. Then, the witness Xi Taoran testified that Xi Xianglin was indeed eating wedding banquet at my house on the night of September 21 last year. On September 23, people from their family came to my house to report that Xiangquan had been kidnapped. Then, on September 24, Xianglin went back. Under questioning, the defendants Shen Xinyi, Tan Xinglou, and Xi Xianglin all denied the charges. Tan Xinglou testified that I had eaten at Xiangquan's house three times after Xiangquan was released. Shen Xinyi also said that in September last year, I was teaching in Kaifeng, Henan, introduced by a friend named Xu. I request that Xu be summoned to court to provide evidence. At this point, the lawyer Wang Zengxian, hired by Xi Xianglin, made a statement. The judge ordered that another joint trial be held later. Shen Xinyi and Tan Xinglou were remanded into custody, and Xi Xianglin remained on bail. The court then adjourned.</p>

<p>Crowd of Flagmen Submits Document to Customs Commissioner</p>
<p>Zhou Linhe, the Chinese chief foreman of the Zhang Huabang River Customs Station in Songnan, resigned after his term of service expired. According to precedent, the vacant position should have been filled by the second foreman, Yin Yunlang, and the vacant second foreman position should have been filled by Song Yinlang, who has served the longest. However, the foreign officer in charge of the station promoted Zhou Adi, who has not yet served fifteen years, instead, causing dissatisfaction among the flagmen at Fort Baoshan. They submitted a document to the Shanghai Customs and River Affairs Commissioners, requesting a thorough investigation and handling of the matter. It is heard that the Customs Commissioner has sent a letter to the foreign officer at Zhang Huabang, instructing the foremen to go to Shanghai for an interview. The original document is transcribed below: To falsely report to superiors, disrupt regulations, and promote foremen improperly, requesting a thorough investigation. Respectfully reporting, we, the undersigned flagmen at Fort Baoshan, because the Zhang Huabang flag chief foreman (Na Ma Hun) Zhou Linhe has completed his term of service and has requested to resign, which has been approved, and will hand over the position on April 1. The vacant chief foreman position should be filled by the Fort Baoshan second foreman (Na Ma Tuo) Ba Yuang. The vacant second foreman position, according to customs regulations, should be filled by Song Yinlang, who has served the longest. Unexpectedly, Zhou Linhe, by fraudulent means, and with the Zhang Huabang Deputy River Affairs Commissioner, promoted his nephew Zhou Adi, who has the shortest seniority and lacks experience as an inspector, ahead of others. It is rumored that this has already been decided. We believe that this matter concerns fairness and violates regulations. We have specifically clarified the facts. The reason is that Zhou Linhe only knows how to benefit himself, disregards justice, and imitates the feudal power of warlords, occupying all foreman positions for the Zhou family and not allowing others to intervene. Now, the newly promoted Na Ma Hun Yin Yunlang is Linhe's brother-in-law, and the small steamship captain Zhou Linlin is his elder brother. However, the vacant Na Ma Tuo position is not considering promoting Song Yinlang, who has served for 28 or 29 years, but is instead promoting his nephew Zhou Adi, who has not yet served fifteen years, ahead of others, treating regulations as trifles and justice as child's play. Under the banner of the Blue Sky White Sun, he still wants to use feudal power to suppress colleagues, making it impossible for others to be promoted, which is not allowed by law and is difficult for justice to tolerate. We believe that this matter concerns the public and cannot be tolerated in silence. Therefore, we have no choice but to briefly describe the facts and earnestly request a thorough investigation and handling to uphold justice and comply with regulations. We urgently submit this report and await your orders. Respectfully submitted by the flagmen at Fort Baoshan.</p>

<p>Half a Cargo of White Rice Taken by Those Claiming to Be Refugees</p>
<p>Zhang Songgen's rice boat from Qingjiao, loaded with 150 shi of white rice, was en route to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Because the wind was unfavorable, it anchored at the border of Qingjiao. Suddenly, more than 20 Jiangbei small boats arrived, with a large number of people, claiming to be refugees, men, women, and children, swarming onto the boat. They opened Zhang's boat's cargo hold and, seeing the rice, claimed they were borrowing it. Zhang told the refugees that this was cargo for customers and could not be lent out. He said that if they were short of food, he would be responsible. His attempts to stop them were ineffective, and they used baskets to carry away approximately half of the cargo. Fortunately, a customs patrol boat, after being notified, sped to the scene to suppress the situation, but the boats had already escaped. Zhang came to Shanghai yesterday to report to rice merchant Wang. Rice boats in Shanghai were alarmed upon hearing the news and were wary. It is reported that rice merchants will hold a meeting to discuss prevention measures.</p>

<p>Dong A'tu Meets His Runaway Wife on the Road</p>
<p>Wu Xiaomei Doesn't Want to Go Home</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at approximately 5 p.m., a young, short-haired, fashionable woman was weeping loudly by the river at the Xinzao Bridgehead on Xinzao Road. In an instant, onlookers crowded around. Suddenly, a man resembling a country bumpkin pushed through the crowd and grabbed the woman. After a while, five or six ruffians came and forced her to go to the Chunjiang Teahouse. According to the country bumpkin, his name is Dong A'tu, from Chongming. The woman's name is Wu Xiaomei, 18 years old, and she is his wife. They were married in their hometown last autumn and were initially harmonious. However, she disliked my ugly appearance and her feelings gradually faded. I knew I was not attractive to women, so when I married her, I did it entirely with money. I gave her parents 500 yuan and paid off her debts of more than 300 yuan. However, after three days, she treated me like an enemy and never let me touch her. I knew my shortcomings and was accommodating in every way. Unexpectedly, she took an inch and wanted a mile, taking my ornaments and running away to Shanghai. It's been two months. The day before yesterday, I was informed by a friend and came to Shanghai to look for her. I met her on Datong Road and she had completely changed her appearance. I urged her to return home, but not only did she refuse, but she also denied that I was her husband. So I wanted to take her to the police station. According to the woman, my parents were blinded by greed. Because he was rich, they sacrificed me, a small and weak woman, for him to trample on. I was raped when I was fourteen. He used his money and power to marry me, but he is nearly forty years old and has a hidden disease. There is no marital joy at all, so I eloped to Shanghai. Now I am a maid in North Sichuan Road. If he wants me to return home and resume our marriage, I would rather drown myself in the river. Later, the Shanghai ruffians forced the woman into a pre-hired car, which sped off in the direction of Carter Road. The woman was still crying all the way.</p>

<p>Zhou Bao and Wang's Conflicting Claims</p>
<p>Zhou Bao from Nantong brought his wife, Zhou Wangshi, and her lover, Jiang Afu, to the Second District Police Station yesterday, accusing his wife, Wangshi, of running away to Shanghai six years ago without a trace. Now, I came to Shanghai on business and stayed in a copper workshop on Huining Road. Unexpectedly, while strolling around today, I saw the defendants living together on the Meixie Road in front. I approached them to ask about it, but she refused, so I brought the case to the police station for investigation. Under questioning, Zhou Wangshi said she was 26 years old. At the age of 20, she had an affair with Zhou Bao in Nantong. The following year, Zhou Bao sold me to Chen Lao San, who ran a brothel at No. 3 Yangzi Lane on Caishi Street, for 130 yuan. I suffered a lot. Last year, I met a client, Jiang Afu, and we fell in love. So he paid 90 yuan to redeem me from the fire pit and I am willing to be his wife. Jiang Afu's confession was roughly the same. The station provided confessions . The court decided to conduct an inquiry in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>Zhang Juncheng's Home Fortunate to Avoid Robbery</p>
<p>At the home of Zhang Juncheng, No. 44, Old Shanghai County Houjie (Back Street), Shanghai, at around 2:00 AM the night before last, a robber suddenly appeared. He descended from the roof of a neighboring house using a rope and broke into the upstairs inner room. Holding a gun, he threatened the occupants to remain silent. He robbed them of tens of dollars in cash and some miscellaneous jewelry. Still unsatisfied, he forced the owner to open the lock on the chest. Unexpectedly, two bullets from the pistol held by the robber fell to the ground. As the robber bent down to pick up the bullets, the owner seized the opportunity to grab the robber's pistol. Shouting for help, they struggled with each other, causing antique porcelain vases and other items to fall onto the floor below, making a loud noise. People downstairs were awakened and began shouting to catch the thief. The robber then forcefully pushed the owner down, jumped out of the window, climbed over the roof of the side room, and escaped from the roof of Fumei Lane. During the struggle with the robber, the owner suffered injuries with bleeding to the hairline of his right ear and both hands. The incident has been reported to the First District Second Precinct for investigation.</p>

He was spotted by the patrol officer at the ferry, who found his behavior suspicious. He was taken to the Fourth Team of the Lujiazhai Police Station. At the same time, the detectives also tracked him to the team. The team leader dispatched senior officers to search the boat, where they found 41 pistol bullets and a magazine. They were all brought to the team. Team Leader Zhu questioned He briefly and then sent him to the Third District Office of the Public Security Bureau, which transferred him to the Public Security Bureau for further action.

<p>Regarding the Shi Chunsheng Robbery Case</p>
<p>Jin Mao Escapes, Zhang Shaoyun Captured</p>
<p>About two or three miles northeast of Gaoqiao Town in Pudong, at the intersection of the three counties of Shanghai, Baoshan, and Chuansha, there is a river called Jiebang. The area south of the bridge is under the jurisdiction of the first district of Shanghai County. Nearby lives Shi Chunsheng, who used to work at the Wuhu Customs and has a comfortable family situation, making him a target of criminal gangs. Zhang Shaoyun (nicknamed "Xiao Guangdan"), a well-known hoodlum in Gaoqiao Town, specializes in creating trouble and exploiting the local people in the countryside. His son, Jin [illegible character], relies on his father's reputation as a hoodlum and forms gangs, acting lawlessly in the countryside. Recently, they learned that the Shi family had considerable savings, so they gathered a gang, armed themselves, and went to rob Shi's home. Because they were unfamiliar with the route, they temporarily forced a local tailor, Mr. Jia, to act as their guide. They went to Shi's home and robbed him of several hundred dollars' worth of property. Still not satisfied, they also robbed the neighboring Zhu family and another family. They fled with the loot, divided it, and spent it. Shi Chunsheng recognized Mr. Jia among the robbers, so he immediately reported to the Fourth Precinct of the Third District. Precinct Chief Lan Zhusan dispatched police to arrest the tailor, Mr. Jia, who confessed that Zhang Jinmao had organized the robbery. Because Zhang's family had been hoodlums for generations with many accomplices and possessed several pistols, Chief Lan immediately reported the situation to Director Yuan of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who ordered the detective team to select capable detectives Gao Wansheng and Wang Chenglong, etc., to carry live ammunition pistols and rush to Gaoqiao Town across the river on the morning of the day before yesterday. They cooperated with the armed police officers of the precinct to arrest Zhang Shaoyun at his home in Jiangjiazhai. However, Jin Mao was well-informed and had already escaped. Only a pistol and a list of accomplices were found under the floor of the house. Later, Zhang Shaoyun was arrested at the Xujaqiao Teahouse and was sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation yesterday.</p>

<p>Only Known by the Surname Zhao, Name Unknown</p>
<p>Chen Shiguang, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after receiving orders to take over the former Jiangsu Special Envoy's Office building, moved the office into the building. However, the building had been neglected for years, resulting in several major leaks in the terrace during rainy weather. If repairs were not carried out quickly, the building would fall into disrepair. He submitted a request to Minister Wang for funds to repair the building, which was approved. The project was contracted to Yuanhe Foreign Firm with an estimated cost of several thousand taels. However, yesterday (the 28th) at 4:30 PM, a worker surnamed Zhao was working on the bituminous felt roofing on the clock tower of the diplomatic building. He accidentally stepped on the hatch under the bell. Because the hatch was not bolted, he lost his footing and fell, landing on the offering table in front of the portrait of Sun Yat-sen. Due to the height and weight, the surface of the offering table was broken, and the frame of Sun Yat-sen's portrait was also knocked down. He immediately lost consciousness. Although other workers tried to rescue him, he did not speak. The foreman immediately took him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is reported that he was seriously injured and still unable to speak, so the worker's name could not be determined. According to the foreman, the bituminous felt roofing project was contracted to Dayouyi Hardware Store. The injured worker was temporarily hired, so only his surname Zhao was known.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Verdict in the Case of a Japanese Girl Killed by a Car <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>An eight-year-old Japanese girl, Shi Qiangmaila, was hit and killed by a cargo truck with license plate number 16542, driven by a car driver named Cheng Atao, on Gordon Road. The police have filed a lawsuit against the car driver in the Provisional Court. As previously reported, the deceased girl lived in a foreign house at No. 967 Gordon Road and studied at a Japanese school. Every day, she was transported to and from school by car number 5339 arranged by her family. On the afternoon of the 13th of this month, the deceased and several other Japanese children were riding in the car back home. When the car arrived at the entrance of the residence, the children got out of the car one after another to return home. At that moment, Cheng Atao drove the cargo truck, knocking down and running over the girl. Although she was immediately taken to Fumin Hospital, it was too late to save her. She died from her injuries. The police accused Cheng of driving too fast, causing the fatal accident. After Judge Sun Yuan conducted a preliminary investigation, he determined that it was necessary to conduct an on-site investigation of the distance between where the deceased was hit and the roadside curb, as well as the circumstances at the time of the collision, the width of the road, and the direction of travel. Therefore, at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, he went to the scene of the accident with the court clerk, the police lawyer Ru Baozhen, and the Western police chief Jefferson from the Gordon Road Police Station to conduct an on-site inspection.

<p>Result: Crushing Defeat of Scotland by Five to Zero</p>
<p>Past Records: Hong Kong, 23rd – This is the sixth International Charity Competition since its inception in Hong Kong. In the past five sessions, apart from the first, a total of four teams have participated in each session: the Chinese team, the British team, the Scottish team, and the Portuguese team. The Portuguese team joined in the second session. Over the past five years, Scotland has won three times, the British team once, and Portugal also managed to win once in their first year of participation. Looking back at our country, we have unfortunately failed in the finals every year. This victory, which can indirectly bring international honor through football, has been regrettably taken by others in each session.</p>
<p>This Year's Competition: This year, the four teams participating in the competition are still China, Britain, Scotland, and Portugal. In the preliminary rounds, Britain played against Scotland, and China played against Portugal. Among the four teams, China and Britain are the strongest. As a result, China defeated Portugal without saying. However, Scotland luckily defeated Britain. Therefore, the final match was between China and Scotland. The Scottish team was originally not weak, but unfortunately, many of their skilled players had been transferred to India not long ago. Therefore, the Scottish team lamented the difficulty in selecting talents. After recent consultations, a not-so-strong team was finally determined. Our country's army, on the other hand, is full of talent and does not worry about not having one. Everyone knows that this year has great potential. Yesterday, the long-awaited final between China and Scotland was held. This day was the second day of special horse racing. The weather was clear and sunny, and there were naturally many people going out. However, the number of people going to the football field to watch this final was several times more than those going to the racecourse to watch horse racing. Around three o'clock, the stands on the east and west sides were already packed with people. Those who arrived later continued to pour in like a tide. As a result, all the seats were occupied, and it was inevitably crowded and bustling, as one can imagine.</p>
<p>Lineup: Soon after, the Scottish army also arrived. Our country's army was wearing red and white striped jerseys and white pants, while the Scottish army wore blue jerseys and white pants, with blue and white socks. The flags of both sides were distinct, and the atmosphere was heroic. After taking photos together, the referee, Ya Qianchen, blew the whistle. Lin Yuying, the commander-in-chief of the Chinese army, and Valentime, the commander-in-chief of the Scottish army, met each other first, and then the battle began. The lineups of the two countries are as follows:</p>
<p>(China): Chen Xipei (Zhonghua), Li Yuda (Zhonghua), Li Tiansheng (Nanhua)</p>
<p>Lin Yuying (Zhonghua), Huang Ruihua (Zhonghua), He Zuoxian (Zhonghua)</p>
<p>Ye Beihua (Nanhua), Sun Jinshun (Zhonghua), Huang Baisong (Zhonghua), Li Huiguan (Zhonghua), Cao Guicheng (Zhonghua)</p>
<p>(Scotland): Luo Zha (Hong Kong Club), Ke Lin (Police), Shi Jilu Fei (Kowloon)</p>
<p>Mai Bulai (Hong Kong), Mai Jiliwei (Police), Jilu Qilai Shi (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Shi Ge (Hong Kong), Valentime (Police), Fu Lisha (Police), Suobei (Navy), Bei Lu (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Kickoff: The Scottish army got the advantage of the terrain first, and our army opened fire. Sun Tuitui kicked the ball to Ye Beihua, wanting to directly approach the Scottish capital along the left wing, but the right guard, Mai Jilu Fei, had strong legs and resisted the attack. The Scottish army immediately took advantage of the situation and forced back from the right wing, but it was ineffective. At this time, the momentum was strong, the firepower was fierce, and the bombs kept exploding, making the battlefield atmosphere extremely tense. Ye, the left wing forward of our team, advanced alone, firing three shots, but the Scottish army's defenses were strict and he could not succeed. Once, Cao, the right wing forward, rushed forward bravely and passed the ball to the center, but Huang and Sun missed the opportunity to cooperate.</p>
<p>One Goal: After a fierce battle, neither side could determine the winner. After about a hundred rounds of fighting, our army finally gained the upper hand. Not long after, Cao ran quickly on the right wing and passed the ball to a key area of the Scottish side. At this time, the veteran Huang Tuitui also arrived. The veteran did not covet the credit. Seeing the ball falling, he deliberately jumped high, intending to let Lao Sun take the shot. General Sun Tuitui was indeed a veteran of hundreds of battles. He intercepted the ball and shot again. The ball was neither high nor low, as fast as an arrow, and went straight to the enemy's goal. How could the Scottish goalkeeper, Luo Zha, resist it? Just like smoke passing before the eyes, the ball had already reached the bottom of the net. Our army won the first victory. Until the end of the first half, Cao shot another goal on the right wing, but the game was called to a halt. Although China scored twice in the first half, only one goal was counted as a victory.</p>
<p>Resume Battle: After exchanging positions, the Scottish army saw that the previous strategy was not effective and changed the lineup. Center Forward Fu Lisha retreated to become the right back, Mai Jilu Fei was changed to the center back, and Mai Jiliwei was moved to the center forward. The Scottish army beat the drums and opened fire first, wanting to regain the city, but our army was strong and the cannons were powerful. Not only did they defeat them, but they also continued to press forward. How could the Scottish army stand against our mighty army?</p>
<p>Two and Three: Another opportunity for our army arrived. Cao, on the right wing, took the corner kick. A certain general received the shot, hitting the top of the goalpost and bouncing to the ground. Originally, this shot would have entered the enemy's goal, but it was not counted. However, luckily, the veteran Huang got the ball and headed it. General Tuitui responded with another header, finally scoring. Our army won the second goal. Not long after, Ye rushed in sharply on the left wing. Fu Lisha tried to seize the ball, all the way to the boundary, but Ye got it back. He lightly passed it to Lao Sun, who shot with his left foot, but it was blocked. Unexpectedly, his right foot kicked up, and the ball went into the net again. Sun Tuitui scored for the third time.</p>
<p>Four and Five: Three victories for the Chinese team were not enough. Sun and Ye, the left and right wings, advanced each other. Ye passed to the right, and Cao went for a kick, but unfortunately, it went over the enemy's goal. Afterwards, the veteran Huang passed the ball to Cao on the right wing again. Cao passed it to the center, and the unlucky Fu Lisha touched the ball with his hand, receiving a penalty kick from the nearest position, a twelve-yard kick. Lin Yuying took the shot, and Luo Zha blocked it, but Lin kicked it again, scoring another victory. There was also the final victory, which was also shot in from the left wing by the veteran Huang. Until the end of the game, the Chinese team defeated the Scottish army by a score of five to zero, causing them to abandon their armor and retreat. In this battle, China defeated Scotland by a large margin and set a new record for overseas Chinese in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Award Ceremony: After the bloody battle, the infinitely glorious International Cup had long been displayed at the entrance. At this time, the crowd of spectators gathered around to watch the excitement. First, the secretary of the Football Association, Holan Shi, gave a speech. Because our countrymen were too happy, his words were drowned out, and we only heard one sentence: "China has won for the first time this time." After the speech, Mrs. Su Xuke, representing the Chinese, awarded the cup to Lin Yuying. The commander-in-chief shouted a command, and the generals dispersed with three cheers.</p>
<p>Art Review: Judging the event based on the event, the Chinese team broke the ground this time to set a record for the Chinese and gain infinite glory internationally. In terms of merit-based awards, General Sun Tuitui made the greatest contribution. However, the eleven players who worked together to win each had special honors. Chen, the goalkeeper, insisted on not letting a few people succeed. Li and Li were brave in killing the enemy. The three central defenders assisted in attacking and defending without flaws. The forwards completed their tasks in one go, which is even more commendable. As for the Scottish army, the worst was Fu Lisha, who must take responsibility for the two goals lost. Mai Jiliwei and others had mediocre performances. Ke Lin was quite commendable, and Bei Lu and others had exhausted their abilities.</p>
<p>Epilogue: The Chinese team added infinite glory to China yesterday. The eleven players who played yesterday certainly deserve our praise. However, I believe that the members who defeated Portugal by three to zero in the preliminary round should also be recorded again to commemorate their merits. I remember that the people who played at that time were goalkeeper Bao Jiaping, defenders Wu Jinquan and Li Tiansheng, center backs Liang Rongde, Huang Ruihua, and Lin Yuying, and forwards Cao Guicheng, Chen Shaokang, Feng Jingxiang, Ye Beihua, and Chen Guangyao. Without the first victory, there would be no second victory yesterday. To commemorate their contributions, the two Chinese associations should reward them both together. The members who played fully in the previous match and did not participate again yesterday, I hope you remember them!</p>

<p>Important Officials Determined</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously announced that the Administrative Vice-Minister Liu Dabai and Standing Vice-Minister Huang Jianzhong would serve as the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the National Education Conference Preparatory Committee. It also announced the Standing Committee members and the heads of various departments. Now, because Huang Jianzhong is going to E Province to take office, Zhu Jingnong is concurrently serving as the Standing Vice-Minister. Therefore, there have been slight adjustments to the staff of the Preparatory Committee. It is reported that Zhu Jingnong has been designated as the Vice-Chairman of the National Education Conference, Secretary Zheng Tianting as the Director of the Editorial Department (Huang Jianzhong formerly held this position concurrently), and Counselor Yang Fang as the Director of the Reception Department (Zhu Jingnong formerly held this position concurrently). Furthermore, it is said that the Ministry of Education has now designated Wu Yan, the section chief of the Ordinary Education Department, and Zhong Lingxiu, the section chief of the Social Education Department, to serve as the secretaries of the conference venue when the National Education Conference is held.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Ministry of Education Issues Order: Public Training Program During the Tutelage Period <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee passed the Public Training Program during the Tutelage Period, which was communicated to the Ministry of Education by the Executive Yuan. The Ministry of Education is now transmitting the original text of the program to the education administrative organs of various provinces and cities, as follows:</p>
<p>In order to remedy the shortcomings of past public movements, the Third National Congress of our Party resolved to establish the following four principles as the overall direction of future public movements:</p>
<p>(1) Public movements must be based on the needs of the people for social survival and create organized people.</p>
<p>(2) For national farmers and workers who already have considerable organization, our Party must assist them in the future to enhance their knowledge and skills, raise the standard of their social morality, and promote their productivity and output, so as to achieve the goal of improving the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>(3) Agricultural economy occupies the main part of China's national economy. Future public movements must support rural education, rural organizations, cooperative movements, and the dissemination of new agricultural production methods as the main tasks.</p>
<p>(4) Our Party should make every effort to create self-governing life within schools for young men and women in the future, implement universal physical training for young men and women, promote scientific and artistic gatherings, associations, and publications, and reward practical scientific research and inventions.</p>

<p>(Photographed by Mr. Lin Zemin)</p>
<p>In order to realize the above-mentioned principles and complete the work of tutelage, a public training program is formulated, divided into four sections: 1. Basic principles of public training; 2. Organization; 3. Training; 4. Responsibilities of Party departments and the government towards people's organizations. In the period of tutelage, we must implement the principles of public movement resolved by the Third National Congress. There are also things that should be determined in theory. Therefore, the first section stipulates the spirit of people's organization and the key points to be paid attention to in training. Secondly, to train the people, we must enable the people to have a sound organization, and then the progress of the training work will be effective. Therefore, the second section stipulates how the Party departments in various places should guide the organization of people's organizations. The scope of training, the methods and methods of training are stipulated in the third section. Moreover, in the past, the responsibilities of the Party departments and the government in various places towards people's organizations were unclear, which hindered the progress of the public movement work. Therefore, the fourth section specifies the powers and responsibilities of the Party departments and the government towards people's organizations. This program is based on the needs of the tutelage period as a principle, and how to implement it should be handed over to the Central Standing Committee to formulate detailed methods based on this program for implementation.</p>
<p>Section 1: Basic Principles of Public Training</p>
<p>(1) The organization of people's groups is based on the principle of voluntary organization. (2) Training the people must recognize the needs of the people for social survival and the spirit of Party tutelage.</p>
<p>Section 2: Organization</p>
<p>(1) The Party department should guide various people's organizations to become sound organizations. (2) The Party department should guide various people to complete their organization.</p>
<p>Section 3: Training</p>
<p>First Item: Scope of Training (1) General Training A. Organizational Training: To enable the people to understand the meaning and methods of organization. B.

<p>(2) When the Party department punishes the people's organization without guidance, it must submit it to the higher Party department for instructions, but the dissolution of the people's organization must also be transferred to the local government for execution in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3 id="e177">A Small Statistic on the Native Places of the Martyrs of Huanghuagang <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>—Si Xuan</p>
<p>Today, nineteen years ago, is the anniversary of the martyrdom of our seventy-two martyrs in Guangzhou. The tragedy of their death can be immortalized in the history of the Republic of China. Since our Party unified the country, the names of the martyrs have become more prominent. Confucius said that it is to achieve benevolence, and Mencius said that it is to take righteousness. That is what it means. Among the martyrs, those from Guangdong are the most numerous, followed by Fujian. The two provinces of Guangdong and Fujian were the earliest to trade with Europe and the United States, and the most overseas Chinese reside there, and the oppression of imperialism is also the most severe. From this, we can know the vigorous spirit of the people of the two provinces, and it is no accident that the revolutionary base is named. The statistics of the native places of the martyrs are listed below.</p>
<p>Guangdong: Forty-one people</p>
<p>Fujian: Nineteen people</p>
<p>Guangxi: Six people</p>
<p>Sichuan: Three people</p>
<p>Anhui: Three people</p>
<p>In terms of counties, Huaxian, Guangdong, has reached seventeen people. Huaxian is the hometown of Hong Xiuquan, the leader of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Perhaps the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs was influenced by Hong?</p>

<p>— Yan Qian</p>
<p>Collected Last Words of the Martyrs</p>
<p>A year passes easily. It is again the solemn and tragic Huanghua Festival. Therefore, I have collected the last words of the martyrs as "Eloquent Words of Huanghua" to commemorate them and to invigorate the national spirit. Dear readers of "Free Talk", have you ever considered that our freedom was not easily obtained? Then please read this article aloud as a tribute.</p>
<p>My revolution is based solely on what my heart believes in. If the heart believes, then act. This is true of Xu Xilin and Wen Shengcai. There is no such thing as an agreement or non-agreement. Everyone in the country is like this. Even Zhang Mingqi, Li Zhun, and you all are just blinded by profit and willingly act as slaves to the Manchus. If you were in my situation, could you guarantee that you would not be revolutionaries? I am performing my duty to save my compatriots. As for success or failure, that is up to Heaven. Who can avoid death? Why be stingy with it? (Confession of Martyr Pang Lie) The country is in turmoil, and the people are suffering. We should act with the hearts of sages and the deeds of heroes. (Words of Martyr Liu Yuandong) The purpose of the uprising is to awaken the compatriots from their dreams. What is meant by inciting rebellion? Sacrificing oneself to achieve benevolence is the teaching of the ancient sages. You are like rats! How can you know the great righteousness? Now that I have been captured, you are lost and will die! (Martyr Chen Gengxin said sternly to the Qing officials) A true man sacrifices his life for the country, it is his duty. Is it that I cannot achieve wealth and status? It's just that I am not like you, who recognize the thief as your father and know no shame. (Martyr Li Deshan cursed the executioner before execution) Do you think this act is a disgrace to warriors? The failure of the matter is Heaven's will. However, it can awaken our compatriots to continue the cause. You are blinded by profit and your blood has grown cold. How can you understand this? (Martyr Chen Kejun scolded the Qing officials) I have nothing to say to the Manchu slaves. (Martyr Cheng Liang was severely tortured by Li Zhun and cursed loudly like this. He then did not answer a single word.)</p>
<h3 id="e179">Returning from Attending the Opening of the Nanjing Grand Theater <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Xin Fu</p>
<p>The Nanjing Grand Theater on Edward Road in this city opened on the 25th of this month. I was honored to receive a ticket to the theater from Mr. Yang Minshi, and was able to witness the grand occasion of the day. After returning, I will describe the scenes I saw in the theater in a jumbled manner.</p>
<p>The Architecture is Elegant and Refined - The exterior of the theater is built entirely of multi-colored artificial stone. The center is interspersed with beautiful and eye-catching bricks. The front faces north. Upon entering, there are silver-white, elegant sculptures that appear before our eyes. On both sides are the lower seats of the hall. In the middle is a stone staircase. Ascending the steps, to the north is the recreational corridor, and to the south are the upper seats. The seats above and below are very comfortable, and the facilities for adjusting the temperature are also very perfect. On the east side of the upper hall and the main hall, there are also very large rest rooms. The electric lights in the theater are of the indirect lighting type, which are bright without being dazzling. In short, the architecture of the theater can be called magnificent and elegant. Being in it is like being in a Roman palace.</p>
<p>Distinguished Guests Arrive - The theater was scheduled to open at 9:00 PM. However, by 8:30 PM, there were no empty seats upstairs and downstairs. For example, the Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality Zhang Qun and the Songhu Garrison Commander Xiong Shihui both came with their families. When the band played the Party song, they stood up solemnly. Their lips moved slightly, probably humming the Party song in a low voice. A Little Sister Opens the Show - The opening performance featured a pair of innocent and lovely young girls under the age of ten. They were dressed in light red Western-style clothes and adorned with red satin flowers in their short hair. They were petite and exquisite, making people love them at first sight. It is said that this pair of little sisters are Miss Xu Miaoyu and Xu Miaosong, both daughters of the famous doctor Xu Yimin, and Mr. Xu is a director of the theater.</p>
<p>Humorous Songs - The film shown on the opening day was titled "Broadway", a latest full song and dance dialogue sound film produced by Universal Company of America. The scenery is magnificent. The plot is bizarre. The singers are like clouds, making people intoxicated. And there are many songs, most of which are melodious and moving. Among them, the song "Does the Chicken Lay the Egg or Does the Egg Lay the Chicken" is particularly humorous. The general idea is that eggs are laid by chickens, and chickens come from eggs. But is there first a chicken egg, and then a chicken, or first a chicken, and then an egg? Even college graduates cannot solve this problem. When the male lead sings this song, he wears a bachelor's cap and holds a stick, which is very humorous. This humorous song is set to a humorous tune, and then added with a humorous performance, which makes the audience even more unable to hold back their laughter.</p>
<h3 id="e180">The Old Fellow Townsman is Still Very Enthusiastic <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Hermit</p>
<p>The old fellow townsman, Sun Juxian, is already ninety-one years old, but his spirit is still very robust. Last year, he performed a play to raise funds for the Yizhi Hall, and unexpectedly won great praise. This year, the Tianjin Red Swastika Society is experiencing financial difficulties, so it also used the old trick of the Yizhi Hall, asking the old fellow townsman to help greatly. It is scheduled to perform plays to raise funds on the 27th and 28th of this month. Although this old man is old, his enthusiasm is still not diminished. He readily agreed to the society's request, and volunteered to perform important good plays to attract attention. The first day will have two performances, one during the day called "Washing Silk" and one at night called "Fish Intestine Sword". The second day will be the full play "Four Jinshi". It is also heard that the ticket prices are very low, with downstairs seats costing one dollar and twenty cents per ticket, and boxes costing six dollars per room. (Recently, various small newspapers in this city have spread the rumor that old Sun has already come to Shanghai to perform on the Shanghai stage. However, inquiries from friends in Tianjin say that this is definitely not true. It is attached here to clarify the truth.)</p>
<h3 id="e181">A Record of a Strange Monk from Goryeo <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>There is a famous monk in Goryeo named Shui Jinan (transliteration), who is currently fifty-six years old. He is energetic and has the appearance of a young man. He is an enlightened monk. According to what he told people, he has not eaten millet for several years. He only eats three pine nuts a day to live. He is confident that he can live to be over three hundred years old. Three years ago, Shui went to Japan and told the people in the Tokyo Noble Club that there is no other way to longevity than to calm the mind and reduce desires. Since I became enlightened, my living expenses have gradually decreased. Now I can live without spending a penny. What is the value of three pine nuts and a cup of clear water that I eat every morning and evening? During his speech, he took out pine nuts from his bag, which were the same as those we usually see in the mountains. A bag of pine nuts can last him three months of life. At this time when rice is as expensive as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, Shui is indeed a lucky child.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, Shui was still working in the diplomatic office of the Korean-Japanese government. Then he served as a police patrolman in two major cities. Before long, he suddenly encountered a high monk, who passed on to him a Buddhist secret book. He became enlightened and resigned in 1917 to live his immortal life in the deep mountains and valleys. Shui was originally a devout Buddhist who studied Buddhism and had a lot of insights. According to what he told people, his longevity method was obtained from this secret book, and he worked hard to obtain it. After the founder of Buddhism, there were many who obtained his way and lived long, becoming immortals. The average lifespan could reach three hundred years. However, it was difficult to practice and was lost over time, so that today there are many who die young and have not heard of anyone who has lived to be over two generations. Shui has been practicing hard in the mountains for thirteen years. He has nothing to do on weekdays. He only enjoys sculpting Buddha statues. In the past thirteen years, it is said that he has made more than one thousand six hundred statues. Most of them are recorded in Buddhist books, but have not been seen by people. Shui's merits are also great. Recently, it was heard that his relatives and friends, as well as those in Japan who believe in him, are about to raise funds to build a temple for him in the mountain where he lives to enshrine the statues he has sculpted. The Japanese are inherently devout Buddhists, so this matter is probably within expectations. It is also heard that Shui will exert his remaining strength to search for the gods recorded in Buddhist scriptures who have been buried and are not prominent, and sculpt statues for them to enshrine, to spend his remaining years. He is confident that he still has over two hundred years of life, and does not need to ask Confucius to lend him a few more years to engage in his work. Record this to see what happens later.</p>

<p>— Lai</p>
<p>After arriving in New York, I sent a letter, which should have arrived. On the 14th, Minister Wu invited the troupe to Washington to perform, specifically to introduce Wanhua to the political authorities and dignitaries from all walks of life. Unfortunately, President Hoover was away from Beijing on a trip and did not attend the grand event. After returning to Beijing, he heard about it and deeply regretted it. He immediately requested the Chinese Embassy to send someone to New York to discuss with Wanhua and perform again. If a solution is determined, it is bound to happen. The program for this performance was arranged by Mr. Zhang Pengchun (Zi Zhongshu, younger brother of Mr. Zhang Boling). Mr. Zhang has a deep understanding of drama and is particularly able to understand the psychology of the audience. His program and schedule are as follows:</p>
<p>Before the Curtain - Music (2 minutes) Explanation (5 minutes)</p>
<p>Fenhe Bay - Each scene after entering the kiln (27 minutes) Short break including curtain calls 4 minutes</p>
<p>Before the Curtain - Music 1 minute Explanation 3 minutes</p>
<p>Green Stone Mountain (rearranged) 9 minutes Short break including curtain calls 4 minutes</p>
<p>Before the Curtain - Music 1 minute Explanation 3 minutes</p>
<p>Stealing the Box and Dancing with the Sword 5 minutes Curtain call 1 minute Break 15 minutes</p>
<p>Before the Curtain - Music 3 minutes Explanation 5 minutes</p>
<p>Stabbing the Tiger 31 minutes Curtain call 1 minute</p>
<p>Total 120 minutes</p>
<p>The performance starts promptly at 9:00 PM and ends at 11:00 PM. Mr. Pengchun is in charge of the curtain. The punctuality is rarely seen in American theaters, and is especially commendable in Chinese theater. The explanation on stage is given by Ms. Yang from Guangdong. Her language is precise and extremely pleasant to listen to. The audience listens without any sign of fatigue. The performances focus on expression. After many rehearsals directed by Mr. Zhang, who also serves as the stage supervisor, the direction is smooth and his enthusiasm is admirable. The 16th was the day before the public performance. On that evening, famous New York playwrights, directors, and reporters were invited to the theater to watch the performance. This was the most critical moment. Praise or criticism would follow. Its nature was similar to undergoing a trial. However, after a song ended, not a single person did not express satisfaction. The next day, theater reviews were published in various newspapers, all of which praised the performance. The audience has been incredibly crowded for days. Whenever Wanhua finishes performing a scene, the applause from the audience is incessant. The curtain calls even reach six or seven times. For Chinese drama, which is completely different from Western interests, to be performed in America and be admired by the masses, it shows that art has no boundaries and has true value.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Plans After the Conclusion of the Honeybee Painting Exhibition <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Swallow</p>
<p>The Honeybee Society Painting Exhibition, initiated by famous painters Zheng Wuchang, Xu Zhao, Qian Shoutie, Sun Xueni, He Tianjian, etc., lasted for a week. Visitors were very crowded. The collaborative fan paintings during the remaining events were especially welcomed by customers. Hu Peiran and Liu Dingsan even bought more than ten fan paintings, showing great interest. The book exhibition in the last three days was also very enthusiastic. Some people who already had painted fans asked for collaborative calligraphy. Ren Jinshu, Zheng Wuchang, Qian Shoutie, Xie Gongzhan, Ye Weishen, Sun Xueni, etc. collaborated on regular, cursive, clerical, and seal scripts, which was most rare. According to statistics, the results of the ten days were very good. At the closing ceremony, Qian Shoutie proposed that the remaining paintings and fan paintings be donated to charitable organizations to benefit the public. The proposal was approved by everyone. Zheng Wuchang proposed to set up an art lecture series, inviting famous artists to teach the advanced members of the society, and to set up a Honeybee Club as a place for members to collaborate and gather. The charter was drafted that day and will be announced later. It is heard that more than a hundred people have joined the society. Among them, Hu Ruosi is only fifteen years old, while Xu Chunxi is already seventy-seven years old. One old and one young, painting fan paintings together at the meeting, is truly an elegant event. By the time the meeting was dismissed and the curtain closed, the remaining lamps had already leaked. I am writing this down to record the event's grandeur.</p>

<p>However, Fengyun still felt a little unconvinced in her heart, often making cold remarks and adding a kind of cold laughter. She was originally a frustrated politician in this room, and they regarded her as a reactionary element in general. Today, everyone crowded around to see this photo, and seeing Zuo Shichen acting as if he was doing something important to check their fingers, Fengyun first curled her lips and let out a cold laugh from her nose, saying, "Second Master, then let me take a bath and then come and see it. Didn't the ancients have to bathe in fragrant water before receiving the emperor's edict so that they could open it and read it?" Zuo Shichen was so stumped by her that he couldn't open his mouth, saying, "No, no. Looking at photos often leaves two fingerprints, which is very ugly. I also had a photo the other day that everyone was looking at, and it left several fingerprints. I used an eraser to try to erase them, but they wouldn't come off. Moreover, some people even talk to the photos, and the saliva splashes on the photos, which is also very annoying." At that time, Fengyun had already pouted and walked away, not wanting to look. Hanyun and others were more honest, saying, "My fingers are very clean, and I definitely won't leave any fingerprints." After a while, they discussed what kind of frame to use and where to hang it. It wasn't until eleven o'clock that Ruiyun finally came back. Zuo Shichen thought to himself at that time, "Ruiyun must be very happy to see this photo, because she has already asked several times if the photo is ready and how come it hasn't been printed after a week." She also said, "I know that everyone else's photos are taken very well, but only mine is taken the worst. If it's not taken well, I'd rather not have it." But Shichen teased her and said, "It's no use if you don't want it. Everyone else's photos are taken very well, so they will naturally want to take them. You can't cut yourself out of the twelve people." Saying this made her even more worried. She said, "Then what should I do? Thank you. Can you help me think of a way?" Zuo Shichen said, "Don't worry. Your photo isn't taken badly. I've already seen it on the glass plate. Not only is it not bad, but it's also taken very naturally and freely." She said that she hadn't seen it herself and couldn't believe it. She had to see it with her own eyes before she could feel relieved. But now that it's been developed, it's indeed not taken badly. She was relieved to see this photo. Since it was taken very well, she was naturally very happy to see it. Zuo Shichen felt that seeing Ruiyun's happiness was like his own happiness, because Ruiyun came back every day after finishing her performance at around eleven o'clock. Although she was inevitably a little tired, she was very happy. Sometimes she was even very happy, because she had a kind of lively and innocent childlike spirit, quite like the "Aijiao" that the Japanese talk about. She sometimes had a face full of Aijiao, not restrained at all. And it wasn't anything frivolous. In that kind of intentional or unintentional question, there seemed to be a kind of pure and genuine character, which made Zuo Shichen think of her running barefoot in the desolate garden in Nanjing.</p>

<p>The Environment is Excellent, Turning from Flat to Sharp - Yesterday, the 28th, the gold market situation turned from bad to good and has exceeded the 500 taels mark.

The large silver bars returned to an upward trend and opened slightly lower, but the demand in the market was not diminished. Although the foreign exchange listed price increased by half a grade, the internal market was still firm. Coupled with the banks absorbing spot goods, it gradually rose, thus exceeding 500 taels. In the afternoon session, Shunli and Wanxing continued to sell, and Hengxingyuan and Sheng bought again, and the market situation became more solid and profitable, once jumping to 501 taels and one mace.

Moreover, the bank transaction price was still stable. Maihang and Taiwan mutually traded the near-term at 11 pence 3125. In June, Datong and Mitsui mutually traded the US dollar at 47 yuan 375. The buyers on the table were particularly active, so the price rose by more than one tael. The spot banks had a strong appetite. Around 11 o'clock, it rose to over 99 taels. Tonghui and Maihang mutually traded June British gold at 11 pence 375. Dongya issued the US dollar at 47 yuan 3125. The Japanese gold settled the far-term at 1 tael 04 fen 25, and the near-term at 1 tael 04 fen 875. Therefore, by 11:30, it reached 500 taels 004 qian.

However, there were some couplings in the British gold industry in June, and the price was only 11 pence 3125. Although there were no large tickets traded on the table, the price has been pulled up by several qian. It dispersed at 4:30, and the result was 500 taels 009 qian, an increase of two taels and six qian compared to the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>The Closing Price Finally Made a Deduction of Nine Taels - Check the highest price of the unified market was 501 taels and 1 qian, and the lowest price was 497 taels and 8 qian, with a review of three taels and three qian. The announced price has been changed to 510 taels, because the Japanese gold is listed at a small half, totaling a deduction of about ten taels. The initial deduction of the announced price in the afternoon was ten taels, and the final deduction was nine taels. The registered water compensation was 500 taels, and the afternoon water compensation was 01 taels.

A considerable amount was settled using current silver dollars and banknotes. The market was instantly bustling and more active than usual, leading to a surge in transactions compared to the past. However, this trading was purely local, so the commission rates remained relatively stable.</p>
<p>Commission Rates: The "foreign commission" opened at 72 cash in the morning and slightly improved to 72.125 cash in the afternoon, still showing a slight weakness compared to the previous day's market, but without a major decline. The "silver commission" opened at 2% in both the morning and afternoon sessions, weaker than the previous day's afternoon session, indicating a loose situation. Clearing house activity was consistently weak. Banks were releasing funds daily, indicating ample supply in the market, but lacking demand, leading to a quiet market and sluggish sentiment.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: Jiangnan small silver dollars opened at 61.5 cash in the morning, with no transactions occurring. The afternoon price was 61.525 cash, similar to the previous day, with only 3,000 "jiao" transacted.

<p>Accumulating Inventory Increases Panic</p>
<p>Forced Maintenance Policy Fails</p>
<p>The weakness of the yarn market has been brewing for a long time, showing signs of a major drop. It was actually held back by a large firm, allowing it to be temporarily maintained. Now, the stockpiles of 20-count Five Blessings, Shepherd, and 10-count coarse yarn are increasing daily, while sales are completely cut off, causing panic to rise sharply. Small short sellers, seeing the unfavorable situation, are rushing to sell, causing the decline to sharpen significantly. It is found that many of the longs of a certain manufacturer are being squeezed by the sellers. Most eyes in the market are on April futures, expecting 145 to 146 taels. However, the overseas cotton yarn market is still firm, it is said.</p>
<p>Recent Yarn Prices Plunge by 2.5 Taels: In the morning session before the "Renbiao" market opened, with American cotton stable, a selling frenzy suddenly arose in the market, with buyers conversely lacking. This is because the underlying inventory is too thick, with near-month contracts falling 1.4 taels and far-month contracts falling 1.5 taels. In the afternoon, small short sellers panicked, with April and May contracts falling 0.35 taels and far-month contracts falling 0.47 taels. The total transaction volume for the day was 20,500 bales. The closing prices of the "Renbiao" market are recorded on the left:</p>

It is found that the total purchases by various groups throughout the day were 1,630 bales, with 250 bales traded among colleagues. Prices fell by over 0.5 taels. Among customer groups, the Guangdong group had the strongest intake, with 690 bales, Sichuan 260 bales, Xuzhou 105 bales, inland 110 bales, Han group 85 bales, Qingdao 195 bales, Xiamen 60 bales, Tianjin 60 bales, and miscellaneous groups 65 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market is slightly weak, mainly because the rise in American cotton has stabilized, and most forecasts expect a possible pullback. Therefore, buying interest is less active. However, the Han group is still pulling in without letting go. However, the sharp drop in the yarn market has slightly affected the cotton market.</p>
<p>Cotton Futures Continue to Fall by 0.2 Taels: In the morning session, the market opened with a lack of buyers and a relaxed market atmosphere. Prices for all months fell by 0.15 taels. In the afternoon, the market remained flat, with prices for all months falling another 0.05 taels. The total transaction volume for the day was 25,000 "dan."

<p>American Cotton Flat and Weak, British and Indian Continue to Rise: Yesterday, American cotton was volatile due to fears of a rebound. It was initially firm due to spot traders buying, but then fell due to long covering. Futures rose and fell by 1 to 8 points, while spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton futures rose by 2 to 6 points, and spot prices rose by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 15 points. Indian cotton was stable due to mixed buying and selling by brokers.

<h3 id="e192">American Cotton Will Squeeze Delivery of May and July Contracts <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Consumption Remains Flat... Cotton Acreage Estimated to Decrease Slightly</p>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 27th reported on the recent cotton market conditions: The near term is fearful, and most of the shorts are manufacturers and cotton merchants. From a responsible perspective, the government agencies (cooperatives) want to squeeze the delivery of May and July cotton contracts. Regarding the amounts and speculation on future methods, there is no value now. However, it is expected that the delivery number will not be small. Consumption is flat, and domestic piece goods trade is mixed. Preparations for the new cotton crop are slightly better than in previous years. Sound cotton acreage estimates say that the acreage has decreased slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e193">British and Japanese Cotton Industry Agreement <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The British Have Not Yet Officially Acknowledged</p>
<p>The news that British cotton industrialists hope to conspire with Japanese cotton industrialists to monopolize the world cotton industry market has already been noted in previous reports. According to the Eastern News, after this news was released, the press paid great attention and immediately telegraphed its correspondent stationed in England to inquire of Mr. Skater, the head of the Eastern Department of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce. He replied that there is currently no cotton industry agreement between Britain and Japan, but he greatly agrees in principle to the coordination of the British and Japanese cotton industries. As for the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, it may be due to one of my letters. As for the actual methods of coordination, I am sorry I cannot clearly state them. When the British and Japanese relations are discussed, the answers to the questions will be found. It is found that when this news was first revealed, Japanese cotton industrialists also denied it, but it has become an undeniable fact. Mr. Skater may be due to diplomatic considerations, or he may not know that this matter has been made public, so he is still unwilling to clearly express it. Japanese cotton industrialists have already acknowledged this fact and have discussed it.</p>

<p>The Osaka Japanese Cotton Traders Association investigated that from September of last year to the end of January of this year, Japan imported 1,316,224 bales of various raw cotton, which is a decrease compared to the previous period.

<h3 id="e195">Grains: Rice Market Temporarily Stabilizes Due to Scarcity <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the source was still small, and the river channel was also not smooth. The production price of coarse rice from the inside roads remained difficult to lower. Northern japonica rice was as firm as ever, but the local authorities have strictly limited the price from exceeding 20 yuan on the market. Helplessly, transportation merchants and cargo customers are taking a wait-and-see approach due to heavy costs, so the high-quality japonica rice on the market has not been sold. Only ordinary Zhongguan japonica rice is circulating, priced according to the limited 20 yuan price. Therefore, most of the goods traded throughout the day were Zhongguan goods. The buying interest in thin rice is not weak, and store demand is very strong, with stable prices. High-quality goods are already around 19 yuan. Yangdu River goods are almost completely depleted. Although there are some, they are extremely small, so there is no standard for large disks. Xian rice from customer ports in the streets is selling well at zero discount, with a tight situation. Bianyuan is ultimately a fancy product and has no development of any kind. It only slightly rises with the general trend.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: River shipments are scarce, and store sales are still active. Changxi machine-milled japonica rice here is priced at 20 yuan for top-quality goods, and transactions are extremely active. Sutong machine-milled japonica rice inventory is very scarce, and market demand is quite strong, with rising prices, but it has tended to stabilize in the afternoon. At present, it completely depends on the source for changes. If shipments are scarce and do not arrive, it is feared that price limits will be difficult to achieve. The southern ship convoys of Lian Tang and other thin early rice are still arriving, and buyers are giving more importance to these goods due to the shortage of northern japonica rice, so sales are active, and the general disk is firm. Only southern route goods are available for Yangdu sharp rice, and northern goods have stopped arriving, so this sharp rice is becoming increasingly firm, selling as soon as it arrives. General-purpose, yin-cured rice has a strong appeal to the rice dumpling vendors, and the dumpling sales are also brisk. The general trend is rising by a corner, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Spot Foreign Rice Scarce and Continues to Sell Well <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market saw futures prices stabilize slightly due to foreign firms selling off. Spot rice arrivals and inventory are both low, remaining firm. 500 bags of spot goods were initially opened for sale at a price of 14.94 yuan. 500 bags of No. 1 were delivered to Saigon, also reaching 15.35 yuan. Other goods were scarce and not opened. Route goods were slightly better by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan, but only several thousand bags were offered. 2,000 tons were opened for distant deliveries, and the price was similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Annan Indica Rice Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Annan coarser-grained indica rice, similar to river-bottom indica rice, is welcomed by Shanghai merchants who need to sell it as river-bottom rice. Unfortunately, the production is small and arrivals are scarce, making it difficult to maintain a presence in the market for a long time. Yesterday, 1,000 bags of recent goods were sold, with delivery expected in about a week, priced at 16.20 yuan. Those for delivery in three or four days were priced at 16.30 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Flour Market's Speculation is Hot <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw different perspectives after the morning opening. Although the quoted price for foreign wheat saw a slight decrease again, the speculative craze of internal and external longs did not pay attention at all. Their only goal was because the largest factory was selling very few goods. Although small and medium-sized factories were selling a considerable amount, it seemed that outsiders occupied half of the April and May volume. The longs raised the price at will, which is so-called holding for higher prices. In terms of actual sales, Tianjin's Hehua brand is not selling, and Shanghai's Shen flour sales will inevitably decrease from now on (the current Tianjin inventory of both local and foreign flour totals 2.2 to 2.3 million bags). The market price of foreign wheat, excluding the premium, is similar to that of local wheat. If factories have the capacity to maintain the price of goods, they should seize foreign wheat as a future means of relief. Otherwise, the longs' momentum will be difficult to calm down for a while. As a result, this month was 0.025 yuan better than the previous day, April was 0.075 yuan, May was 0.01 yuan better, June was 0.025 yuan better, July was slightly 0.025 yuan worse, and August was 0.025 yuan better, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Wheat Futures Still in Progress <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, this month's contracts had already been settled and there was no market. The other months remained firm due to outside interest, so the opening price rose again. According to recent conditions, April's contracts are still mostly held by factories among the longs. If high-priced goods are scarce in the future, they will inevitably be squeezed again. As for the distant months, inland merchants, in light of the soaring rice prices, are still strongly interested in buying, so the future trend is still more likely to rise than fall. As a result, April was 0.01 yuan better than the previous day, June and July were each 0.01 yuan better, and August was 0.02 yuan better. Spot wheat was generally stable, but the high-priced goods on the market were all being delivered at the exchange. The goods that were being traded were all of medium to lower quality, so the price felt cheaper. The opening price was 5.11 taels for Jiangsu and Suzhou wheat, 5 taels for Jiangxi wheat, 4.96 taels, 4.92 taels, 5.08 taels for Mingguang wheat, 4.92 taels for Anqing wheat, 4.82 taels, 4.6 taels, 4.72 taels for Shashi wheat, 4.57 taels for Hankou wheat, 4.53 taels, 4.33 taels, for a total of 5,000 bags, which was handled by Shen Dahua Feng, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Soybeans Plunge by 0.05 Yuan <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the standard Lianyuan beans fell sharply due to a telegram from Dalian reporting a decline. The spot opening price entered the 7 yuan level, so selling interest in Shanghai turned strong. The recent price fell back to 5.29 taels, a drop of more than 0.005 taels. The guild's spot goods were still relatively flat in the early morning, but also turned weak in the afternoon. Inland merchants' demand was very small, so transactions were few. Only three carriages of Pingge grade were transacted, with the price opening at 5.4 taels. Both arrivals and sales of Yangtze River beans were weak, and the market was also poor.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Piece Goods: Fine Serge Sales Turn Active <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Local Cotton Cloth: Prices fluctuated, and coarse cloth declined again. Yesterday, 16-pound Double Elephant opened at 7.05 taels, 13-pound Horse Dog at 5.95 taels, Double Horse at 5.9 taels, and 11-pound Three Cats and Three Deer both at 4.6 taels. 9-pound Car at 4.05 taels all showed softness. Yihua bleached cloth was in strong demand from local customers due to the shipping season, and supply was insufficient. Yesterday, Golden Three Pagodas opened at 7.725 taels, and Yunwai Hall Incense at 7.925 taels. Spot fine cloth was almost exhausted. However, Blue Double Fish fine twill slightly declined, selling at 6.625 taels yesterday. Coarse twill remained sluggish, with few inquiries.</p>
<p>Western Piece Goods: Yesterday, a large number of goods were shipped out, because the customs would be closed today and tomorrow is also a regular Sunday holiday, so those in urgent need of spring goods were all reporting them for shipment. Among them, the shipment of East Asian Yuan yarns was the largest, causing Shanghai's inventory to be almost empty. Dian Qiuxiang's line goods have been completely sold out, and the plain goods require 8.25 taels, Lintongguan 8.05 taels, Western Beauty 7.8 taels, and printed satin is also selling well. Shoulao Qilu Sanhua was sold out at 0.02075 yuan per foot, stripes were 0.02 yuan, and fine serge continued to rise by 0.0025 yuan. Miscellaneous brands were actively moving. Baixiang Fengboting blue-gray was 0.02325 yuan, Yuxian Tu was 0.02275 yuan, and Baizitu was the same price. Goods that had been stagnant for a long time had a sense of turning from bad to good. Yesterday, the West Asian merchants shipped more than 20 pieces of jacquard foreign yarn to the Yangtze River gang. Yuan canvas was slightly moving. Hua Ji Four Rats was 0.06375 yuan, and Anli goods was 0.0475 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Silk and Tea: Silk Market Benefits from Cocoon Shortage and High Costs <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Dry Cocoon Base Requires Net Pull of Over 1,000 Taels</p>
<p>Dry cocoon inventory is thin and cannot be replenished. Last year, various silk factories reduced work and stopped machines in order to regulate production. This spring, European and American silk merchants, due to the surge in gold prices and higher prices for Japanese silk, abandoned Japan and turned to China. Shanghai silk sales turned smooth. However, cocoon inventory became increasingly scarce. The current market price for spring dry cocoons in Wuxi is over 170 taels per dan. When 600 catties are reeled, the net cocoon cost per silk bag requires a pull of 1,020 to 1,030 taels. The silk cost is still high, so the silk market is increasingly firm and selling well. Yesterday morning, there were continued telegrams from Europe turning to Shanghai, and Chinese merchants' attitudes became firmer. Yesterday, Lan Lebi and others entered 60 bales of Shanghai white factory warp, Xinfu entered 20 bales of Shandong yellow factory warp, and Dachang entered 20 bales of gray warp. Prices were still profitable.</p>

<h3 id="e207">The Tutoring System at Great China University <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Jing</p>
<p>The authorities at our school, Great China University, considering the difficulty students face in choosing careers and the complexity of social life, wanted to provide appropriate guidance before students leave the school. This would enable them to adapt appropriately to social and professional life after graduation. Also, as Vice-President Ou said, another reason was: "Nowadays, schools place too much emphasis on formalities. Students attend classes to obtain certificates, and teachers teach to receive salaries. The relationship between teachers and students is limited to a specific time. Once that time is over, they go their separate ways. Teachers don't know their students, and the responsibility of guidance is lost. Students don't understand their teachers, and the idea of learning from them disappears. If they don't communicate with each other, how can there be any instruction? But it doesn't stop there. In recent years, schools have been in turmoil, and student movements have been rampant. There have even been instances of students beating teachers, and student killings of principals are not unheard of. The friendship between teachers and students has completely vanished. The drawbacks of this are countless." Therefore, they considered advocating a tutoring system.</p>
<p>The tutoring system at Great China University was implemented in the first semester of last year. At that time, based on a resolution by the Academic Affairs Council, twenty-one current professors were appointed as tutors. They were under the Academic Affairs Office and initially only applied to fourth-year students in the liberal arts, science, commerce departments, and second-year students in the advanced normal program. At that time, there were more than one hundred and seventy students being tutored. The Academic Affairs Office distributed students to various tutors based on their department, major, hometown, and other factors. Each tutor was responsible for guiding about ten students. This was the first trial implementation of the tutoring system at Great China University. The procedure at the time was that the Dean of Academic Affairs first convened a general discussion, explaining the history of tutoring systems in European and American universities, the purpose of implementation at our school, and points to be noted. Afterwards, they proceeded in groups. The methods of each group were slightly different, including holding tea parties, dinner parties, and even outings and excursions, to achieve the purpose of meeting and talking. As for the content of the discussions, it was truly complex and covered everything: personal cultivation, family and marriage, current affairs, career choices after graduation, and anything else that was relevant. Although there were considerable achievements, it was a pity that the implementation time was too short, only about a week before the approaching graduation exams. In the following semester, because of the initial experiment, the results were still fairly satisfactory, so it was decided to continue with many improvements, roughly as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Expand the scope of the tutoring system from fourth-year students in each department to third-year students in each department. The number of tutors was also increased proportionally.</p>
<p>2.  Because the tutoring system seemed to have the nature of extracurricular work, the University Affairs Council decided to transfer it to the Committee on Group Education.</p>
<p>3.  After discussion by the Committee on Group Education, in order to suit the psychology of the students, it was decided to allow students to choose their own tutors. As a result, the school was enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The above three points are roughly the improvements made in the previous semester, and because of the longer duration, the results were better.</p>
<p>The semester has just started, and the school authorities, in order to meet the needs of the students, are continuing to work tirelessly. They have already announced the list of students who will be under the tutoring system this semester and have resolved on three measures, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>1.  Students in the original groups, except for those who have graduated, will still be guided by their original tutors. Students promoted this semester will be allowed to choose their own tutors and then be assigned.</p>
<p>2.  Freshmen will be guided separately by the deans of each college, the heads of each department, and the heads of each major.</p>
<p>3.  Measures:</p>
<p>A. Notify the deans of each college, the heads of each department, and the heads of each major by letter, and attach a list of freshmen, asking them to meet and talk with the freshmen at any time. B. Announce this measure to all freshmen.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the conversations of our classmates, we can often hear them telling each other that the discussion with a certain tutor was interesting, that a certain tutor's treatment was generous, and even talking about how delicious the food was at the dinner party. Naturally, we will also find many interesting stories in the process, and I will report on them continuously when I have the opportunity.</p>
