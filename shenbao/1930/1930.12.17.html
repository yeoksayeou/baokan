<p>世間之事。一時發展過甚者。不久必有甚大之反動自歐戰以後美國財力之雄厚。代英國而執世界之牛耳。商業興盛。股票日漲。舉凡世界上興一大業。借一大債。非美莫屬。不意近數月來。商業一經衰落。失業人數。爲各國冠。股票旣跌。銀行之關閉。與經理等之自殺者幾於日有所聞。此即所謂盛極必衰也世間之事不能奮往前進。必致後退。方今世界之君主國。若意若英若日若比若西。已寥寥無幾。意英日比等國。皆在奮往前進。故國中尙能相安。西班牙在今日。全無前進之精神。故國中之政局。亦不能相安。罷工舉。久而不息。今且發生革命之戰鬭。是蓋國民之心理。無國不思前進。苟且圖安之國家。終必反致多難也。</p>
<p>世問之人。顧大局者少。修小怨者多。故一國之中。往往爭黨派。爭宗敎。而置國家與。民族於不顧。印度於劇烈抗英聲中。而回敎徒與印度敎徒之相鬭。仍復不絕。即今在英開會之圓桌會議。亦因回敎徒與印度敎徒。關於議會代表權之要求。不能調停。而致不能進行。此亦急小緩大之一端也。</p>

<p>國民十六日瑪德里電西班牙總罷工之形勢、詳情若何、因當道對各報紙檢查極嚴、無從探悉其究竟、據聞有數處之罷工已遭失敗、僅經一度頑抗、即被官軍制服、又其他數處則反是、政府方大受挫折、而據西皇宣稱、則謂各地軍隊均一致忠於政府、故不難於今日肅清全國之反動、且革命方面多係烏合之衆、毫無團結、所以不難一鼓成擒也云云、</p>

<p>電通十六日東京電　大藏省及内務省關於由軍縮剩餘金而减輕國稅之舉、早着手審議具體案、至於昨日、始爲最後的决定、提出本日閣議正式决定後、即提出於今冬議會、且减稅不僅國稅、即地方稅亦輕减、其具體案内容如下、（一）地租之减輕、（甲）平年度一○·八一○·○○○元、改正地租法之稅率爲百分之三·八、（乙）昭和六年度六·七七七·○○○元、改正地租法之稅率爲百分之四、六年四月一日施行、（二）營業收益稅减輕、（甲）平年度四·三七○·○○○元、法人之稅率爲百分之三·四、個人之稅率凈利千元以下之金額、减至百分之二、超越二千元之金額、减至百分之三·六、（乙）昭和六年度一·三一○·○○○元、個人之稅率凈利千元以下之金額、减至百分之二·五、超越千元之金額、减至百分之二·八、施行期昭和六年四月一日、（三）糖消費稅之减輕（甲）平年度六·○五○·○○○元、（乙）昭和六年度二一○·○○○元、减輕稅率施行期昭和七年一月一日、（四）織物消費稅之減輕、（甲）平年度四·一三○、○○○元、（乙）昭和六年度九一○·○○○元、减稅額合計、平年度二五·三六○·○○○元、六年度九·一○○·○○○元、又砂糖及織物之減稅、不於年度之初實施、於適當時期行之、以上專就國稅而言、至地方稅亦斷行同様輕減如下、（一）營業稅、個人營業收益四百元以上乃至千元者、照國稅營業收益稅所減之額、以同様之比例減輕課稅率、（一）特别地租、明年度府縣提出之預算、已包含相當之減稅、故制度上不設減稅方法、若以此方法減稅、照内務省計算、約減二百數十萬元、</p>

<p>吾國如破舟碎帆。尙能無恙者多賴總理之主義耳。然牗户未完之時。輒慮風雨漂搖之危黨部對黨對國。負責最生。諸同志之努力邁進。可謂竭盡心力矣。滬市黨部復於年關百忙中。「舉行小學生黨義演說競賽會。」誠深慮遠謀之計也。月之十四。係該會决賽期。會塲假市商會。尙寬敞聽衆約八百。塲周環立中國女體校童軍。圓冠紅褂。黄衫黄褲。若西國王室衛隊。生色不少爰將是日見聞。筆之於左</p>
<p>總理遣像前求籤　加入演說者。共六十一人。以市校及立案私校爲範圍。十日起分三組預賽。産出各組决賽人選十八。即是日之演說者。開講前。朱家讓同志。召集講員至大台下總理遣像前抽籤。以定講演先後。籤自箸製。置一筒内。大小·式様·顔色宛如城隍廟内大老爺前有求必應之靈籤。當衆學生蝟聚抽籤時。敎局周君向潘公展低語云彼輩在總理遺像前求籤矣其命運或將由此預卜。惜總理無籤訣以安其心。聞者捧腹。即仰首不語之吳開先陶百川同志。亦大開笑口。</p>
<p>不會演說偏演說　主席童行白報告畢。黨代表潘公展致訓。旋爲市敎局代表周君尙致訓。周開口便謂。不諳演說者赴演說會已屬笑話。不諳演說者赴演說會偏再演說。眞奇談矣。幸非自動來此。乃强迫而至望勿以笑話奇談目之。然則不能演說之原因可聞乎。曰不精國語。曰學校乏機會曰社會禁止說話。曰文字爲「之乎者也」而非「的了你我他」曰政法專制。偶語者尙欲棄市。演說自無餘地。吾國歷史上演說家亦不多見。戰國時雖有縱横捭闔之游說家。六朝時曾有言論雋永之清談家。然未見有如Cicero有如Lincoln有之唯我總理。彼以演說力量闡明主義。喚醒民衆。深盼小朋友。效法總理以演說作救國建國之初步方法。</p>
<p>三民奮鬥與努力　諸同學登台時。中心不免忐忑。小心翼翼。然外表大多鎭定。從容不迫。操流利之國語。口若懸河。滔滔不絕。令人心折無旣。記者與同行者費昆年·施毅軒·郭光緝·王潔諸君。相約統計各人講詞中三民主義。奮鬥。努力等字名。口吻中三民主義最多者計二十四句。最少者三句。平均每人七句。奮鬥兩字最多者。爲十六句。最少者二句。平均每人五句。述努力最多者十九句。三句係最少者。平均每人說四句。他如「總理。」「國父」「中山先生」「革命」「救國」「建國」等辭。亦不少。然終不若如三類之多且普遍也。</p>

<p>來學旨趣　老學生不詳其姓氏。聞係湘籍。以里居共匪擾攘不寗。每易一地。喘息未蘇、又須他徒。老學生無奈。乃毅然來滬。暫避其鋒。旋以滬濱生活高昻。在湘時即慕持志名。私心竊念。與其坐食逆旅。毌寗讀書是尙。因報名考入學校。</p>
<p>勤儉一斑　老學生非家無片瓦者。亦略具資産平居布衣布服。布襪布履。猶是田間本色。每日息作亦如他生。唯不善運動。課餘餐罷。輒一人兩手負背。安步縱覽校内景色。藉資遣懷。顧鬚髮雖呈灰白。而精神矍鑠。不讓少壯。受課時靜聽講解。篤志向學。諸敎授咸多之。聞投考時爲一年級。圖高務遠之青年。見之似有愧色也。</p>
<p>互相輝映。持志旣有一老學生。而正風文學院亦來一老學生。所異者正風僅選修佛學一科。此老無鬚。但春秋當在五十以上。或曰此殆崇拜蔣竹莊先生佛學而來。其言頗近之矣。</p>

<p>十三日回拿貓。臨上車陳文君來贈以本廠圖數張。蓋不可多得之品。沿途盡竹林。曾問之友人。如此北缅多竹。可開造紙廠否。友人或曰造紙須大毛竹爲宜。北缅均細竹。當不宜也。但余閱報有缅人開一大紙廠。盡包全缅之竹林。向政府立案。則非不可造紙矣。夕住拿貓又名五科椿。蓋可想昔日初開闢時之名也。但今尙無客棧。只二三家小蓬可住人而已。此次所住之蓬較前次一家更不如。但可享受一種山民生活趣味。其蓬居河岸邊。山坡挑夫艱難。從小徑上。蓬廣而黑。其旁畜猪雞。乃山坡副業也。天未明雞數唱。久居市者不得聞此矣。其雞多居於蓬之下層。因南方地濕。人多以下層畜家畜。不但雞豬。高大之房。馬牛羊雞豕均居下層。汽車亦可置。蓋可想其下層之空而大也。但吾見各地初殖民之工農人則甚苦。大抵印度人初到此間者。只搭蓋一草栅。内置木床。編以繩。則無下層而直臥於地上矣。莊子曰。濕寢則腰疾。鰌然乎哉。亦其習慣與。欲求平等。蓋難言也。</p>
<p>有一種野人者。男女背竹籃來市貿易。衣服華麗。婦女修飾尤美。男帶刀護行去南渡。及回時常見之。蓋山中有野物。不容不帶刀也。且小村落野人。亦往往有危險。故邊僻之民尙武勇矣。　　拿貓爲運銀塊經過之重鎭。其銀塊每塊約重三十斤。如此大塊。聞每日可出數十萬塊。</p>
<p>必談矣。友人伊川氏。昨爲余言花會中最近之軼聞二則。明知言者諄諄。聽者藐藐。然旣有可言之機會。不敢不盡其誠。况本刋施行極廣。或可爲失足回頭者萬一之助。則硜硜之見也。</p>
<p>酒令翻新　伊川氏於上星期三。被譜兄河内氏柬招赴宴。酒半。河内氏夫人某女士出酒籌裝以牙筒。筒貯牙籤若干。雕刻極精。然所刻皆花會所謂諸神。於是胡亂行之。而河内夫人乃與同座之晉陽女士。各述花會之害如左。</p>
<p>打吊桶慘劇　有某女士者。早喪母不得已。托庇於後母膝下。早歲童騃。苦樂不自知。稍長。後母虐待之。然女士雖糼。能察知後母所好。夜有夢。朝有聞見。必爲後母述之。頗亦有所中。金錢關係。居然愛之如已出焉。一日。母夢臨井涿水。旦而詢女。女習聞鄰右言。凡力不能封包。者必以夢爲卜。鄰又適至。曰昨夜夢臨井而汲吊桶上下如轉軸。女因曰。信矣。花會日開三筒。惟早筒爲隔夜所懸。曰吊筒。最公正無所私。今母與鄰夢皆如是。打早筒必獲雋。母信之而并無應。損失且較鉅。母怨恨不已。女大懼。入後圃。取井上吊桶摜之。曰物旣無靈。奈何入夢以累我。遂擲桶於井。不意憤極。用力太猛。竟使桶與繩離。復慮母或需汲。求桶不得。咎亦在已。解衣入井摸索。一失足而不可復出。一弱小妹親見之。走告母。母曰。自作孽。不可活。取而薄葬之。此十日前事。晋陽女士所述也。</p>
<p>必得其壽　花會中有所謂「必得」者。某村學究年已老。在科舉時代。曾取佾生。近年學界潮流。羣趨於科學學究益侘傺。無聊賴。近年友人携之賭塲。司記錄。（按鄉村賭塲必有一人司記錄）稍分餘潤。積得番佛二百尊。最近聞人談花會之神奇。見人占夢所得。頗怦然心動。會夜夢學使者按臨。題爲「必得其壽」一句。醒而大喜。竟以巨資十元打一必得」門。及揭曉。適晚餐。一聲康了。大失所望。飯梗在喉氣塞良久。竟不得其壽矣。家人環泣。而已無及。此亦匝月内事。河内夫人所述也。</p>
<p>雅謔餘音　伊川氏又言。河内夫人此籌。成於十五年前。其時乃夫室有小星。夫人置此籌。爲卜夜之戲。中者値寢。皆中則一夫二婦。作長夜之飲。達旦不寐。皆不中。則擯夫臥外廂。是日酒令復行。如夫人亦在座。且徐娘矣。座中女客知其事者。猶舉以相謔云。</p>

<p>第十六回　殷勤問字翠袖謁先生　慷慨談兵青樓宴女傑</p>
<p>凡足以使人麻醉的東西。容易成癮。倘然你要能自已節制還好。不然。便沉迷了下去。那也是自然之理。但是根本一句話。能自已節制。也就不被伊所迷醉了。所以喝酒的人。最初也不過三杯四杯。到後來成了不醉無歸。吸香烟的起初不過飯後茶餘。一支兩支。到後來便一支接連一支。整罐頭的香。烟。一天就要吸幾罐。鴉片烟更不必說了。最初不過在朋友烟榻上。香這們幾口。覺得胸膈筋骨。都極舒泰。到後來昏沉在香霧之中。鬧到傾家蕩産。人就像一個鬼。那裏能節制呢。左詩晨旣心醉綠潛。幾天不到小花園。心中忽忽如有所失。好像就成了癮了。那時翠筠在去年的年底下。又嫁了一人而去。據說那人。也是上海的一個生意人。論他的地位。遠不及前此所嫁的輪船買辦。但他是還没有討過老婆的。年紀也還輕。不過二十七八歲。左詩晨還給翠筠說笑話。說你是有過經騐的了。人家說。「吃一次苦頭學一次乖」。你再調查清楚。現在外面的人心壞得很。不要陪中又有什麽友人之妻弔膀子弔上了。翠筠說。也没有那様相巧的事。所以翠筠嫁了以後。他更少一個地方走處。俗語說的「單嫖雙賭」。是最壞的事。怎麽謂之雙賭。從來一個去賭錢。每少興趣。且乏勇氣。倘然旁邊有個人一聳恿。他們兩人有了伴侶。便立即去了。去了以後。兩個都贏了。當然格外高興。明天再來。兩個都輸了。便商量如何可以翻本。兩者之中。一輸一贏。輸的便可以向贏的通融。至於單嫖呢。更犯所忌。譬如到一家堂子裏去。來時一同來。去時也只好一同去。一切情話之類。有朋友在那裏。也不好顧此失彼。把朋友冷落了。單嫖便是一個人去。其名謂之獨溜。有時并且要瞞了朋友。私自進行。本來男女之問。容不得第三者。徧徧有個不知趣的朋友。釘住了他。便覺討壓了。左詩晨到小花園綠漪那裏去。一向不單獨進行的。或是龍紫耘。或是林蕃滋。或是凌趾祥。吃了夜飯。到那裏去坐坐。偶然高興。約幾個人去打小牌。便敎他們弄幾様菜。所費也無幾。到後來綠漪那裏。忽然裝了一個電話。從前堂子裏裝電話。也没有現在那般普通。裝了電話。連電話簿子上。也没有上他們的用户名稱的。</p>

<p>「闔校共騰歡、看今日笑口都開、標語蝶飛、幟旗龍舞、是正新生命開端、來來來、齊呼法學院永千秋萬歲、我儕應加勉、懍當年苦心宛在、礎基虎立、聲譽鷹揚、欲將大計劃實現、進進進、敢勗同志們毌一暴十寒、」　　我們的沈先生於第二天的清晨、在太陽含笑和車廂接吻中、笑迷迷緩步走出車站、到家裡略爲躭擱、便興怱忽到了校裏來、褚院長也來了、全校只充滿了緊張的情態、各級友會都忙碌煞主席和委員們開會動議、什様表示慶祝、花蝶一般的標語、還不斷地貼得疊羅漢般滿了全校、引得鄰近的學校裏學生、都聯袂前來觀光、淞滬車不斷的經過校門、幾乎把旅客們的頭頸、個個弔出了車廂、情形的熱烈、眞是無以復加、有非拙筆可以形容的了、</p>
<p>學校當局自然和學生同様的欣喜的了不得、知道學生們都急於要見敎務長、因此等不到下星期一的紀念週、便於這天星期六下午開全體大會、由沈敎務長報告經過情形、</p>
<p>沈先生在一千五百餘隻手掌的歡迎聲中、含聲登臺、西窗裏正射進了一派陽光、微風又拂動着他的美髯、笑容忍不住的展露出來、發言乃帶着些微一顫、這時候的沈先生、正不知若何的快慰呢、</p>
<p>他先述了些本校努力的經過、並頻年進行立案的過程、妙語環生、全堂興奮、講到立案正像一個男子向女子求婚時、女同學們更笑不可仰、沈先生高站着臺上、他的丰度正不减他當年做新郎時代邑、他說、立案成功、正像男子已得女子答允他要求而得以結婚一様快樂、不過結婚是一個人的快樂、立案成功乃是全校師生的快樂、最後他勗勉同學們今後更要努力、並担保明年的畢業同學、准可在新大禮堂内舉行典禮、同時更將有十萬元的募捐建築廣大的圖書館購置多量書籍、</p>
<p>離開放假期祗有兩個星期了、我們爲慶祝紀念起見、在下星期五六兩天將舉行一個校舍落成和大禮堂奠基典禮、并有盛大的游藝大會、届時當然要招待來賓前來指敎的、</p>
<p>寫到這裏一種歡歌忭舞的情形、不自主地齊向我倇底奔來、心是在熱烈地跳動、手於是要顫顫然不能再寫了、不過、有民二十級友會的一篇宣言、我還要摘錄幾句、作本文結束、</p>
<p>「吾校自民國十五年成立、幾經顚沛流離、差幸夷能化險······褚公出長吾校、沈公輔之······不旋踵間、竟由一無所有之法科大學、成今根基鞏固之法學院······敎部以支日批准立案聞矣、逖聽之下、全校若狂、在此歡呼聲中、尙望二公積極圖展校務、期與牛津大學先後媲美、二洗東方敎育事業落後之羞、······伏思立案之日、即爲發軔之時、開來繼往、端賴二公、「莊生云、其作始也簡、其將畢也鉅」、徵之吾校、近之矣······」</p>

<p>重逢納喜主人</p>
<p>克洛奇氏（Mr·Krenger）爲歐洲著名經濟家與實業家之一。最近遊歷美國。訪其舊友納喜氏（MrC·W·Nash）於凱奴薩城之納喜汽車廠。知友重逢。樂不可言。蓋一九二八年間。納喜氏曾至瑞京司篤克航城。小住四日。極受克洛奇氏之欵待。此乃初會也。</p>
<p>克洛奇氏乃全球聞名之火柴大王。納喜氏係世界敬佩之汽車巨子。兩氏志同道合。情極篤切。初起之時。並無資本勢力。然能克苦耐勞。始有今日之偉大成作。此二人者。一爲機械師。一爲運輸家。</p>
<p>克洛奇氏與納喜氏均爲利金生銀行之大股東。此次克氏來美之任務。即爲參加利金生銀行支加哥分行開幕典禮而來。乘機訪其故友於其寓邸。順道遊歷美國西部名勝。</p>
<p>一八九三年時。世界博覧會在美國支加哥舉行。克洛奇氏赴美圖謀一職。初則代人賣買房産。從中稍得佣金。積五十元後。即離美東渡。今日克洛奇氏重遊支加哥。情境大異。必生無限感想。而克洛奇氏之景况。亦已大不相同矣。</p>
<p>此次火柴大王蒞美。頗受各界歡迎。支加哥工業會特設宴欵待。克氏即席發表伊對於解决付還國際公債之問題。意見高深。言詞揚長。蓋克氏關於債務事宜。極其熟悉。富有閱歷。是以克氏非但爲火柴大王。亦爲一債務專家也。</p>
<p>查瑞典火柴廠每日供給全球六萬萬人所用之火柴。統領歐亞南美各國之火柴事業。並有推銷專權。克氏吸收世界金融之本領。祇一二人可敵。瑞典政府國庫賴於該廠之稅捐。每年約在千萬金以上。</p>
<p>克洛奇氏此次參觀納喜車廠時。對於新納喜汽車之機械能力。動作式様。設備工程。極加贊賞。異常滿意。據云納喜汽車在歐洲之風行。不遜於美亞兩洲云。</p>

<p>近十年來。對於興建公路。行駛汽車。全國人士。罔不認爲發展交通方面唯一之建設。顧公路旣日開闢。汽車事業。亦隨之而進展。在科學落後之吾國。則汽車一項。惟有購自船來。是吾國雖路政益闢。轉爲歐美多一推銷汽車之市塲。利爲所奪。不知凡幾。此其一。即吾國各大都市。有所謂汽車公司者。其上焉者僅可將各種機件裝置成車。下焉者亦不過修理零件。配置車胎而已耳。若謂能設廠製造國貨汽車。實如鳳毛麟角。此其二。故吾以爲修築道要。便利交通。固爲目前重要之問題。而製造汽車。尤爲挽回利權之策略。僕於去歲曾有類此論議。披露本刋。頃　建設委員會工作計劃概要一書。對於汽車製造廠建設計劃。其發展程序·分爲四期。工作計劃。蒞爲詳盡。爰祿全文如左。俾關懷汽車事業。與愛好舶來品及促進本國工商業者之注意焉。</p>
<p>國計民生稱乎交通者至巨。故總理力倡於最短期間。完成一百萬英里之國道。同時在適當地點。設立工廠製造汽車。以便運輸而利民行也。現在已成之國道不下二萬英里。奉行遣訓、頗爲努力。惟製造汽車問題。則仍未籌劃舉辦。以致日用車輛。仰給於外。殊以爲憾。查民國十八年度。汽車進口總額爲三千六百餘輛。價値在一千萬元以上。漏巵之大。可概見矣。</p>
<p>當此全國統一。建設開始之際。凡百事業。勢必勃興。而行動工具之諸要亦必日亟。本會外察他國交通發展之趨勢。内審國民日用之需求。擬即秉承總理遺訓。故最短期間。在上海或其他交通便利之處。設立工廠。製造汽車及其他類似之行動工具。先從小規模著手。專事製造較爲簡單之商用汽車。（即長途汽車及運貨汽車）及訓練專門職工人才。次乃逐漸擴充設備。增加出品種類及産量。首用集合。及仿造方法。繼而計劃。試繪·及製造新汽車。務使一切車輛。適合我國道途情况。而所用原料亦以能取給於本國爲主旨。將來國内所需一切車輛。小汽油船·以及飛機等。皆可由本廠製造。若是則對外可以挽回利權。對内可以促進工商。國計民生。實利賴焉。茲將汽車製造廠之建設及發展程序分爲四期。每期三年。各期之主要工作出·設備·及資本分述於下。</p>
<p>第一期爲創業時期。本期主要工作。宜暫限於集合外來機件。及製造商用汽車車身·車架·彈簧·以及其他簡單部分。亦可逐漸仿造。初年每日出車一輛。迨工人技能增進後。可加至每日三輛。設備則須有廠地。集合廠·木工廠·金工廠·緞工廠·油漆廠·引擎試騐室·辦事室·繪圖室·車房·堆棧·動力機·打氣機·木工機·金工機·鍜工機·及相當之手用工具等。所有機械工具。皆須暫從簡略。而以可能製造上列貨品爲度。惟廠地廠房。則規模須較宏大。以便日後發展。開辦時資本約需八十萬元。以後每年增加四十萬元。全期投資共爲一百六十萬元。</p>
<p>第二期爲仿造時期。除繼續第一期工作。及增加出品外。宜即進行仿造汽車重要部份。如傳動機關。行路機關。發動機關·及娱樂車之車身等。出品可照前期辦法。逐年增加。至本期末年。每日須能造成商用車五輛。娱樂車五輛。及農用車二輛。設備則除擴充第一期所有外。當添設娱樂車之車身製造廠·及二廠所需之機械。資本平均每年增加八十萬元。全期資本增加共爲二百四十萬元。</p>
<p>第三期爲設計及製造時期。除繼續前期工作外。須自行設計。試騐。及製造全車主要部份。出品亦可照以前辦法。逐年增加。至每日能造商用車十輛。娱樂車一輛。農用車五輛。機器脚踏車五輛。及電力自動車二輛爲度。設備則除擴充前期所有外。須添設試騐室。及試騐器具資本平均每年增加二百萬元。全期資本增加共爲六有萬元。</p>
<p>第四期爲擴張時期。除繼續分期工作外。可儘量擴張營業。增加車輕種類及産額。同時進行等劃及製造小汽油船。軍用車。及飛機等。至本期末年。製造能力。務須達到每日商用車二十輛。娱樂車四十輛。農用車十輛。機器脚踏車十輛。電力自動車五輛。及每月軍用車十輛。小汽油船五艘。飛機五架之限度。設備則除擴展前期所有外。當添設造船廠·飛機廠·及二廠所需之機械。資本平均每年增加四萬元。全期增加一千二百萬元。以上四期合計。資本總額爲二千二百萬元。</p>

<p>道奇貨車新用途</p>
<p>行軌汽車。所以輔助火車之不足。促進商業。便利運輸。經濟合算。至足稱也。英美各國之採用此種車輛者、不一而足。且大都選用道奇貨車、改建種車身。以充斯項用途。中國南部之新寗鐵路。近以道奇行軌汽車。堅優經用。確爲火車之有力的臂助。爰仿英美成例。定製試用焉。駛行以來、成績良佳。頗爲一般人士所贊美。按新寗路共長九十六英里。行軌汽車與拖車。則在相距二十二英里之道山與百沙間。每日往返四次。平均儎客每日可千人。另一行軌汽車。則不裝拖車。駛行於道山及鞏縣問。每日平均儎客可四百人。兩車燃用汽油约均爲每加侖八英里云。（口）</p>

<h3 id="e9">Miscellaneous Comments on Recent World Events <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Events in the world that develop too rapidly at one time will inevitably lead to a significant reaction before long. Since the European War, the financial strength of the United States has become prominent, replacing Britain as the leader of the world. Commerce has flourished, and stocks have risen daily. Virtually every major undertaking or loan in the world belongs to America. Unexpectedly, in recent months, commerce has declined, and the number of unemployed has become the highest among all countries. Stocks have plummeted, and the closure of banks and the suicides of managers have almost become daily occurrences. This is what is known as "extreme prosperity must decline." Things in the world cannot move forward without retreating. Today, the monarchies of the world, such as Italy, Britain, Japan, Belgium, and Spain, are few. Countries like Italy, Britain, Japan, and Belgium are all striving to move forward, so their countries are still able to coexist peacefully. Spain today lacks any spirit of progress, so the political situation in the country cannot be peaceful either. Strikes and uprisings have continued for a long time. Now, revolutionary battles are breaking out. This is because the psychology of the people in every country is to think of moving forward. Countries that seek only temporary peace will ultimately face many difficulties.</p>
<p>People in the world who consider the big picture are few, and those who seek small grievances are many. Therefore, within a country, there is often competition between parties and religions, neglecting the nation and the people. In India, amidst the intense anti-British movement, conflicts between Muslims and Hindus continue unabated. Even the Round Table Conference currently being held in Britain has been unable to proceed due to the inability to mediate the demands of Muslims and Hindus regarding representation in parliament. This is also a case of prioritizing the small and delaying the important.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The bonds issued by the Beijing-Shanghai Railway in the United Kingdom stipulate that weekly interest will be distributed on December 1 each year, with a total amount of 66,700 British pounds each time. They have been distributed on schedule in previous years, so the bonds have a good reputation.

Moreover, this year, due to the reorganization of railway affairs, the equipment costs have increased considerably. The prices for purchasing materials from foreign countries have almost doubled due to exchange rate fluctuations. The Railway Department has now secured 66,700 British pounds and handed them over to the bank for distribution. It is also reported that the department has begun to revise the freight rates to fully prepare for future exchange rate fluctuations. (16th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications has repeatedly received reports from various sources that postal office staff are making things difficult for the public when receiving mail and packages, and handling savings deposits and remittances, causing disputes. Furthermore, what is most criticized is that letters and packages are often delayed or lost. Even local letters within the city sometimes take two or three days to be delivered, and the postal offices in the capital are the worst. The Ministry sent personnel to investigate and confirmed this to be true. This situation not only hinders the development of postal services, but also greatly violates the fundamental purpose of establishing postal services for the benefit of the people. Therefore, a special order is issued to the responsible postal authorities to strictly warn them. If the above situations occur again, those involved are allowed to report them on the spot. Once verified, the responsible officials will be punished with salary deductions for minor offenses and immediate dismissal for serious offenses. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Martial law Declared in the Capital</p>
<p>Troops Fully Prepared for Battle</p>
<p>Authorities Strictly Censor Newspapers</p>
<p>Conflicting Reports on Strikes</p>
<p>Sixteenth National Telegraph from Paris Reports leaking from the Spanish border regarding the strike situation in that country are mostly contradictory, making it difficult to ascertain the truth. It appears that battles broke out everywhere last night. The revolutionaries seem to have long intended a major offensive and have accumulated substantial weapons. Martial law has been declared in the capital, with troops heavily deployed and fully prepared for battle. However, staff at the Spanish embassy here told people that the above news is all rumor and that the Spanish King has no intention of leaving the country.</p>
<p>Sixteenth National Telegraph from Madrid Reports on the details of the general strike in Spain are difficult to obtain due to the authorities' strict censorship of newspapers. It is reported that strikes in several locations have failed. After only a brief resistance, they were suppressed by government troops. In other locations, the opposite is true. The government is suffering major setbacks. The Spanish King declares that troops everywhere are uniformly loyal to the government, making it easy to quell the national rebellion today. Furthermore, the revolutionary side consists mostly of a disorganized mob with no unity, making it easy to defeat them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Fifteenth National News Agency Telegraph from Hendaye It is reported that members of the Spanish Socialist Party residing here claim to have received reports from their homeland that the revolution has been a great success. The influence is particularly strong in Santander, Bilbao, Barcelona, Valencia, San Sebastián, Cádiz, Seville, San Fernando, and various provincial cities and towns. Airplanes are scattering revolutionary leaflets in the sky. While this news has yet to be verified, the situation in Spain is generally considered to be extremely serious.</p>
<p>Fifteenth National News Agency Telegraph from Berlin As of this evening, telephone and telegraph communications in Spain remain cut off. It is expected that a revolution is underway in that country, causing the exchange rate of the Spanish currency to plummet throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Fifteenth Reuter's Telegraph from Madrid It is reported that the famous Spanish aviator Franco, who recently escaped from prison, has reappeared on the political stage. Multiple airplanes are scattering revolutionary leaflets in the sky. Afterwards, 500 rebels gathered at the army airfield, led by Franco. Government troops rushed to attack and fired on the airfield for half an hour. The rebels then raised a white flag. Franco escaped by plane. The number of casualties is unknown. Officials then issued a proclamation stating that 300 of the rebels at the airfield had surrendered, and the rest fled and are being pursued. Martial law has been declared in Madrid, and leaders of the Socialist Party in the capital have all fled.</p>
<p>Fifteenth Reuter's Telegraph from Madrid News tonight indicates that the rebellion has been quelled. Those detained by the rebels have all been released. Government troops are preparing to intercept the remnants of the rebels. It is expected that the unyielding rebels will cross the snowy mountain passes into France.</p>
<p>Fifteenth Reuter's Telegraph from Hendaye At 6:00 AM this morning, a group of extremists in the Spanish province of San Sebastián stormed the provincial governor's office, killing two police officers and destroying the property inside. At the same time, rioters prevented workers from entering the city. The police dispersed them, arresting multiple people and causing casualties. Post offices and telephone bureaus were destroyed by rioters, and telephone lines to other locations were cut off.</p>
<p>Fifteenth Reuter's Telegraph from Madrid Censorship is strict. It is known that no major disturbances occurred in other provinces yesterday. However, in the province of San Sebastián, rioters carrying Communist flags stormed the governor's office and clashed with soldiers and police. Other places are still quiet. According to workers at the airfield who were detained by the rebels, there were only 500 rebels, most of whom did not know how to use weapons. Therefore, they surrendered when the government troops' artillery fire became more intense. Officials claim that only one rebel was injured.</p>
<p>Sixteenth Reuter's Telegraph from Lisbon It is reported that the Spanish aviator Franco has flown to the airfield in Alcázar. Three other Spanish rebel aircraft have arrived in Portugal. Franco and others have mostly obtained permits to reside in Portugal.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Cabinet Meeting Decides on Tax Reduction Plan <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Sixteenth Electric Communication from Tokyo Regarding the reduction of national taxes from surplus funds due to military reduction, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Interior began concrete review, and as of yesterday, a final decision was made. After formal decision by today's cabinet meeting, it will be submitted to this winter's parliament. Moreover, the tax reduction is not limited to national taxes, but also local taxes are reduced. The specific details are as follows: (1) Reduction of land rent: (A) 10,810,000 yuan per year, the tax rate of the revised Land Rent Law is 3.8 percent; (B) 6,777,000 yuan in Showa 6 (1931), the tax rate of the revised Land Rent Law is 4 percent, implemented on April 1, 1931; (2) Reduction of business income tax: (A) 4,370,000 yuan per year, the tax rate for corporations is 3.4 percent, the tax rate for individuals is reduced to 2 percent for income less than 1,000 yuan, and reduced to 3.6 percent for income exceeding 2,000 yuan; (B) 1,310,000 yuan in Showa 6 (1931), the tax rate for individuals is reduced to 2.5 percent for income less than 1,000 yuan, and reduced to 2.8 percent for income exceeding 1,000 yuan, implemented on April 1, 1931; (3) Reduction of sugar consumption tax: (A) 6,050,000 yuan per year; (B) 210,000 yuan in Showa 6 (1931), the reduced tax rate will be implemented on January 1, 1932; (4) Reduction of textile consumption tax: (A) 4,130,000 yuan per year; (B) 910,000 yuan in Showa 6 (1931), The total amount of tax reduction is 25,360,000 yuan per year and 9,100,000 yuan in Showa 6 (1931). Moreover, the tax reduction for sugar and textiles will not be implemented at the beginning of the year, but will be implemented at an appropriate time. The above only refers to national taxes. Similarly, local taxes are also reduced as follows: (1) Business tax: For individuals with business income between 400 yuan and 1,000 yuan, the tax rate is reduced by the same proportion as the national business income tax reduction; (2) Special land rent: The budget submitted by prefectures and counties for the next year already includes a considerable tax reduction, so there is no tax reduction method in the system. If this method is used to reduce taxes, according to calculations by the Ministry of Interior, about 2 million yuan will be reduced.</p>
<p>And this financial source must be compensated by other means. However, since the next year is to change the tax standard and reduce it, 1.88 million yuan to 2 million yuan is sufficient, and the compensation for this financial source is carried out by the following methods: (1) In order to make up for the reduction of prefectural and county surtax due to the reduced national business income tax revenue, the surtax restriction rate of 4.1 percent will be increased to 4.6 percent to 4.7 percent, which can obtain a surplus income of about 1 million yuan; (2) Although the surtax on business income tax is recognized as a tax outside the restriction, the business tax has never been recognized. This time, in order to narrow the gap, the business tax has also been revised to be a tax outside the restriction; (3) If the financial resources are still insufficient, the finances of the prefectures and counties will be reorganized. From this point of view, the local tax is to increase the prefectural and county tax's surtax on business income tax, in order to reduce the business tax of cities, towns, and villages, and to reduce the tax burden of the lowest-level merchants with an annual income of 400 yuan or less, and attribute it to those with an annual income of more than 400 yuan.</p>

<p>Half of the Body is Numb</p>
<p>Fifteenth Reuter's Telegraph from Paris The famous French politician Poincaré felt slightly unwell on Saturday and Sunday, and his body is now very weak. It is reported that he is suffering from pulmonary embolism. At 9:00 PM tonight, a doctor was urgently called in for diagnosis and did not leave the ward at night. Furthermore, a sixteenth telegram from Paris reports that Poincaré's condition has not changed at 8:00 AM this morning. The doctors treating him all say that Poincaré is critically ill. According to unconfirmed reports from the outside, it is also claimed that Poincaré is on the verge of death. The latest report on Poincaré's condition states that the right half of his body is numb.</p>
<p>Sixteenth National Telegraph from Paris Former Prime Minister Poincaré's condition has entered an extreme crisis tonight. According to the doctors attending him, it is feared that the situation is dire. According to unconfirmed outside news, it is also claimed that Poincaré is on the verge of death. The latest report on Poincaré's condition states that the right half of his body is numb.</p>
<p>Sixteenth Reuter's Telegraph from Paris Tardieu visited Poincaré this morning. Because Poincaré was very ill, he looked worried when he came out. Poincaré still attended the Senate debate on December 4 and was very active in the lounge. However, the next day, he felt exhausted and called a doctor. The doctor advised him to rest, but Poincaré did not listen and continued to meet with politicians to discuss the political situation. In addition to writing an article, he intended to read it at the Sorbonne University yesterday. He also engaged in writing every day. On the 13th, his spirit deteriorated greatly, and he called a doctor again. The doctor said that the disease was uremia and high blood pressure, and there was a risk of rupture of small blood vessels in the brain. Therefore, Poincaré immediately went to bed and had bloodletting by the doctor, but the disease of hemiplegia gradually appeared. He then summoned several specialists for consultation. Poincaré's wife stayed by the bed all day long. Because Poincaré was in great pain, even close friends were refused visits.</p>

<p>Scheduled to be Held in Vienna in 1932</p>
<p>Preliminary Draft Has No Importance</p>
<p>Geneva News The International League of Nations headquarters plans to hold the Disarmament Conference in Vienna in February 1932. It is expected that more than 50 countries will participate in the conference, and the number of representatives will reach thousands, making it the largest international conference since the Versailles Peace Conference. The reason for choosing Vienna as the venue is that in Geneva there are committees on land and naval issues, as well as numerous meetings on political issues, which are being held at the same time as the conference. The first conference will close in May or June of that year. The work of the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference has now ended. The draft disarmament treaty drawn up by the commission can be abolished at the Disarmament Conference, so it is not of great importance. (World)</p>

<p>British Prime Minister's Mediation Ineffective</p>
<p>Fifteenth Reuter's Telegraph from London The demands of Indian Muslims regarding parliamentary representation and the opinions of Indian Hindus on this matter are disparate and inconsistent. Mediation has not been effective. Although British Prime Minister MacDonald is acting as a mediator, he cannot reconcile the views of both parties. However, hope has not been dashed. The Muslim Prince of Bhopal is mediating and making considerable efforts. He has invited leaders from both sides to meet at his residence today. This matter urgently needs to be resolved and cannot be delayed. The representatives of British India believe that if there is no agreement, the work of the Round Table Conference to establish a central responsible government will be hindered.</p>
<p>Fifteenth Reuter's Telegraph from London The report of the small committee of the Indian Round Table Conference, which discussed the powers of provincial councils and executive members, argues that the current minority political system in the provinces should be abolished. All provincial affairs, including law and order, should be handled by the administrators responsible to the council. It also argues that the entire executive organ, including all ministers in the executive organ, must be jointly responsible to the council. The governor's responsibility is to appoint senior officials, has the power to dissolve the council, can return bills to the council for reconsideration, or can retain bills for deliberation. Certain bills must have the governor's consent before they are introduced. The governor can retain or dismiss ministers. The governor has the power to temporarily administer the government in the event of government collapse or constitutional disruption.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Chiang to Convene Meeting at Lushan <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Chiang's Trip to Hankou Still Undecided</p>
<p>Lu, Zhu, and Others Return to the Front Lines Separately</p>
<p>The 19th Route Army Heads to Ganzhou to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chairman Chiang went to Lushan from the province on the 11th of this month for a short rest and to visit historical sites. According to news from Jiujiang, Chiang arrived in Xun on the 11th at 2 PM, resting briefly at Zhang's residence on Yima Road. He then, accompanied by Shao Lizi, Zhou Fohai, dozens of aides and guards, transferred from Jiulian Automobile Road to sedan chairs and ascended the mountain. At 4:30 PM, they safely arrived at Guling. The command headquarters was set up in the Lushan Administration Bureau, guarded by the National Government Guard Regiment and the 5th Division. The Jiujiang County Magistrate was also present on the mountain to oversee all arrangements. On the morning of the 12th, Chiang, along with Shao, Zhou, and others, visited scenic spots such as Bailudong Academy, Xiaotianchi (Small Heavenly Pond), and Huanglong Temple, lingering over the scenery, and only returned to the command headquarters in the afternoon. He also telegraphed Wu Zhihui, Chen Lifu, Ma Fuxiang, Wu Tingyang, and others to come to the mountain to discuss important political matters and actively plan ways to eliminate the communist bandits. It has been decided to convene a military conference of the three provinces for bandit suppression within the next few days. On the 13th and 14th, Wu Zhihui, Chen Lifu, Chen Bulei, Ma Fuxiang, and others arrived at Guling one after another. He Jian, the commander-in-chief of the four routes, also received a telegram summoning him to come from Hankou with Liu Wendao to Xun and then to Guling to attend the bandit suppression conference, report on the recent bandit situation in southern Hunan, and seek instructions on all matters. In addition, Wu Tingyang, the former Director of the Construction Department of Guangxi, has also arrived in Guilin, reportedly to discuss issues related to Guangxi province. There are varying rumors regarding the date of Chairman Chiang's trip to Hankou. However, when Chairman Chiang left the province for Xun the other day, he told Lu that he still needed to visit Nanchang. The command headquarters at the Provincial Library in Baihuazhou has not yet been dismantled, and Deputy Adjutant Xiong of the General Headquarters is stationed there. Perhaps Chiang will return to the province when he returns east from Hankou, but this is not certain.</p>
<p>After Chiang went to Lushan, Lu Diping convened all staff members at the provincial government on the 13th, exhorting them to abide by the current affairs and work diligently. At the same time, he also convened a temporary meeting of various committee members, resolving to abolish the exorbitant tax of adding one yuan and four jiao per dan of salt. As for the division commanders such as Gong Bingfan, he returned to Jishui from the province on the 13th to take over the defense area of Xu Kexiang's division. Zhang Huizan also returned to Yongfeng on the same day. Lu then led the Ninth Route Army headquarters by car on the Nanzhang Road on the morning of the 15th, departing from Zhangshu, transferring to warships to go to Ji'an, ordering all units to recapture the Donggu bandit lair at the junction of Yongfeng, Anfu, and Xingguo counties, in order to recover counties such as Yudu, Xingguo, and Ningdu, and to cooperate with the Fujian and Guangdong armies in encircling and suppressing the remnants of the communist bandits. As for Zhu Shaoliang, the commander-in-chief of the Sixth Route Army, he also led the personnel of the command camp by car on the Nanzhang Road from the province to Xincun on the 15th, and then took the dry road from Xincun to Fu, to supervise the Mao, Xu, and Tan divisions in attacking the bandits of Nanfeng, Guangchang, Ningdu, Ruijin, and Shicheng, and to clear out the communist bandits on the border of Jiangxi and Fujian, before entering Fujian. As for the Jiang and Cai divisions of the 19th Route Army, they have been stationed in Pingxiang for many days. Recently, because the Mao and Chen bandits of Suichuan and Taihe were plotting to attack Ganzhou urgently, they were ordered by Chiang to advance to reinforce Ganzhou. According to a telegram from Brigade Commander Ma of the Jin Division, Ganzhou has been turned from danger to safety. However, since the 19th Route Army left western Jiangxi, scattered bandits have taken the opportunity to operate everywhere. Fenyi was captured on the 8th, and Yichun is also in imminent danger.

<h3 id="e63">He Jian and Others Go to Lushan to Attend the Meeting <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Wang Jinyu's and Hao Mengling's Divisions Ordered to Be Transferred to Jiangxi</p>
<p>The First Batch of Personnel from the Command Headquarters Arrives in Hankou from Jiujiang</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Commander-in-Chief Chiang's coming to Hankou to suppress bandits has been rumored for a long time, but the date of departure has not yet been determined. Now that Chiang is stationed in Lushan, it is said that he will stay for several days and then convene a three-province bandit suppression conference in Lushan. Military and political figures here who have been summoned to go are continuously on the way. As for the personnel of the command headquarters, they have been ordered to come to Hankou first and have completely arrived yesterday. The various situations that have been discovered are recorded below.</p>
<p>Lushan Military Conference: Commander-in-Chief Chiang went to Lushan on the 11th to view the snow. Lu Diping, He Chengjun, Shao Lizi, Zhou Fohai, Lin Wei, and others accompanied him. Chiang then planned to convene a conference of military and political authorities from the three provinces in Lushan to coordinate bandit suppression methods in the three provinces. He telegraphed Hankou to summon He Jian, Xu Yuanquan, Xia Douyin, Xiao Zhichu, and others to participate. He Jian arrived in Hankou from Hunan on the 12th, and on the 13th, he and the Mayor of Hankou, Liu Wendao, went by boat. Xu Yuanquan, Xiao Zhichu, Xia Douyin, and Xie Bin took the Jihe wheel on the evening of the 14th, and Zhang Yinxiang and Yue Weijun took the Dehe wheel on the evening of the 15th, to go to Xun and then to Lushan to participate. As for the division, brigade, and regimental commanders waiting for instructions, about two hundred people have reported to the camp and have been ordered to return to their original defenses. After receiving the telegram, they will come to Hankou to listen to the instructions. It is said that all the important people will arrive in Lushan completely on the 16th, and the formal meeting will open within a few days.</p>
<p>Command Headquarters Staff Arrives in Hankou: Although the date of Commander-in-Chief Chiang's arrival in Hankou has not been determined, he will surely come to Hankou. Whether he will go to Hunan is uncertain. The staff of the command headquarters, led by Zhan Zhenhuang, the Director of the Adjutant's Office, and Luo Junqiang, the Secretary-General of the Political Training Department, arrived in Hankou on the evening of the 14th, taking the Jiangxin and Jiangtian wheels to make arrangements first. This includes two officers and seven soldiers from the Staff Office, four officers and eight soldiers from the Adjutant's Office, three officers and eight soldiers from the Management Office, four officers and four soldiers from the Military Hospital, fourteen officers and sixteen soldiers from the Political Training Office, four officers and three soldiers from the Aviation Department, two officers and three soldiers from the Public Relations Section, three officers and five soldiers from the Documentation Section, two officers and three soldiers from the Personnel Section, five officers and five soldiers from the Accounting Section, seven officers and twenty-two soldiers from the Special Affairs Section, one officer and seven soldiers from the Internal Affairs Section, three companies of guards and a platoon of orderlies from the Guard Division, one officer and thirteen soldiers from the Horse Company, one officer and thirteen soldiers from the Messenger Platoon, thirty-six soldiers from the Transport Team, and eleven officers and nine soldiers from the Wireless Telegraphy Unit. In addition, Zhou Bogan, the Counselor, Peng Zhenhuan, the Secretary, and Cui Shulong, the Section Chief, have also arrived in Hankou. Except for the Military Medical Office, the Management Office, the Transportation Office, the Political Training Office, and the Wireless Telegraphy Team, which are stationed in the former Russian Consulate, all other offices are stationed in the Command Headquarters.</p>
<p>The Entire Ninth Army Transferred to Jiangxi: The Ninth Army originally consisted of two divisions, the 47th Division of Wang Jinyu and the 54th Division of Hao Mengling, stationed in the Zhengzhou and Xinzheng area. The Wuhan Command Headquarters recently received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang, ordering the entire army to be transferred to Jiangxi for concentration, awaiting orders to suppress bandits. The location of Wang's Division has been designated as Pingxiang, and the location of Hao's Division has been designated as Jiujiang. The Zhengzhou garrison duties undertaken by Hao's Division will be taken over by Zhao Guantao's unit of the Sixth Division. The troops are successively moving out. The Command Headquarters has already ordered the preparation of vehicles for the large-scale troop movement, with the Hunan-Hubei Railway Bureau preparing 60 trains and the Pinghan Railway Bureau preparing 20 trains. The Construction Department has also been ordered to allocate small boats for crossing the river. The distribution was completed on the 15th. Zhang Shaoluan's 160th Brigade of Hao's Division arrived in Hankou on the 14th, led by Zhang Wowei, the Deputy Division Commander, waiting for a wheel to the east. Li Wenming's 162nd Brigade arrived on the 15th and is temporarily stationed in Liujiamiao. The 161st Brigade and the Division Headquarters were personally led by Hao Mengling and set off from Zhengzhou on the evening of the 14th, and it is estimated that they will arrive completely on the morning of the 16th. After the division is concentrated in Hankou, it will take a wheel to Xun. Wang Jinyu's 47th Division will come to Hankou after Hao's Division has completely departed, taking a train on the Hunan-Hubei Railway to Changsha, and then going to Pingxiang to take over the defense area of the 19th Route Army. As for other troops, it is said that there have also been slight adjustments.</p>
<p>Recent News on Bandit Suppression in Hubei Province: The military affairs of bandit suppression in Hubei Province are primarily focused on clearing the communist bandits in Huang'an. The area is located in the eastern part of Hubei, bordering Anhui, and slightly to the north is Huangpi, bordering Henan. Therefore, communist bandits appear and disappear, like chasing rats. After the fierce suppression by the Xu and Xiao divisions, Huang'an has been recaptured. The remnant bandits have fled to places such as Hekou Town and Qiliping, and are now being jointly suppressed by Xiao Zhichu's division and Zhang Yinxiang's unit, and Hekou Town and Gaoqiao River have been captured. The remnants can be cleared soon. The bandits who fled to Anhui have been blocked and attacked by the Anhui army at the request of the Command Headquarters and have also been defeated. However, there are still remnant bandits holding out in the Huangsangkou area. He Long's bandit unit, which previously fled from Public Security, Jianli, and Shishou in western Hubei and southern Hubei to the border of Hunan, has repeatedly committed crimes in Nanhua, Jin, and other counties. After being jointly blocked and suppressed by the Hunan and Sichuan armies, they were again unable to succeed and returned to the border of Hubei, directly attacking Public Security County. It is reported that the county was captured by the bandits on the 13th, and the county magistrate fled to Shashi, telegraphing the province for troops. Now Xu Yuanquan's division has left Huang'an for Hankou and, upon receiving the order from the Command Headquarters, will immediately go to western Hubei to clear out He's bandits and be responsible for suppressing the bandit lair in Honghu. Xu has already formulated a plan and, after meeting with Chiang and seeking instructions in Lushan, will return to Hankou and then go to Jingsha to engage in the suppression. (December 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Fujian Province's Deployment to Block and Suppress Zhu and Peng <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Zhu and Peng's Forces Have Fled from the Jiangxi Border into Fujian Province</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Zhu De and Peng Dehuai's communist bandit forces, due to the joint suppression by the Jiangxi armies, have fled from the Jiangxi border into Fujian. Currently, Zhu's bandits have invaded western Fujian from Ningdu and Shicheng, capturing Ninghua and Changting counties. Lu Xinming and Huang Yuebo's troops stationed in the area have retreated to Qingle and Guihua. Peng's bandits have also invaded northern Fujian from Yihuang and Nancheng, capturing Guangze and Chong'an counties. Shaowu and Jianyang are in imminent danger due to the thin forces of the defense army. It is reported that Zhu and Peng's bandits plan to first contact the Red Guards of the local communists in the four counties of Longyan, Yongding, Liancheng, and Shanghang in western Fujian, and the people's associations of the local communists in the four counties of Pucheng, Zhenghe, Taining, and Jianning in northern Fujian, to open up a line between northern and western Fujian, and then occupy the counties bordering the two provinces of Fujian and Jiangxi, relying on the mountainous terrain to resist the government army. As for the Fujian Province's bandit suppression forces, Lu Xingbang's unit is currently still in the Yanping and Jianning regions. Zhang Zhen's division will depart for Nanjing and Zhangping. Liu Heding's division is still in the rear area between Shuikou and Fuzhou, far from the bandit area. The provincial government, due to receiving urgent reports from various counties and telegrams from Commander-in-Chief Chiang urging action, yesterday ordered Lu's unit to quickly advance from Yan and Jian to western Fujian at double speed, and also ordered the advance unit, Zhou Zhiqian's brigade, to take the route from Shaxian and Yong'an into Guihua and Qingle, to block the communist bandits from Ninghua and Changting. The rear unit, Lu Xingbang's brigade, will take the route from Shunchang and Jiangle to Shaowu and Jianyang, to intercept the communist bandits from Chong'an and Guangze, and also ordered them to take a defensive posture temporarily, waiting for the main force to concentrate and then encircle and suppress them. At the same time, Zhang Zhen's division was urged to clear out the local communists in the four counties of Yan, Yong, Hang, and Lian in western Fujian by the end of this month, and to recover the lost territory, in order to prevent them from becoming Zhu and Peng's internal support. Liu Heding's division will concentrate in Yanping within the 20th of this month, and then depart from Shunchang and Jiangle to Jianning and Taining, to cut off the connection between the communist bandits in northern and western Fujian. Currently, Liu Heding has ordered Liu Shangzhi's brigade, stationed in Shuikou, to proceed to Yanping first, while he will lead Chen Baitai's brigade from Fuzhou to Shuikou, advancing successively. As for the defense of the rear areas in the provincial capital and northern Fujian, the marine corps Jin Zhenzhong and Lin Bingzhou and the provincial defense army Qian Yuguang and Zhang Ziming's four brigades will jointly undertake the task. Generally, Jin and Zhang's units will be responsible for the counties under the province, and Lin and Qian's units will be responsible for the counties in northern Fujian. Jin Zhenzhong's unit has already departed from the provincial capital to Lianjiang and Luoyuan yesterday, and Zhang Ziming's unit has departed from Luoyuan to the province. Lin Bingzhou and Qian Yuguang, the two brigade commanders, have also come to the province from Gutian to discuss the supply methods and defense area allocation after departing for northern Fujian. However, during this time of large-scale troop movement, there is a great need for military expenses and bullets. The provincial government specially telegraphed the General Headquarters yesterday, requesting that the previously approved military expenses of 500,000 yuan and 300,000 rounds of bullets be sent to Fujian on a fixed date for distribution.</p>
<p>According to military sources, Zhu Shaoliang, the newly appointed Pacification Commissioner for the Fujian-Jiangxi border, has all the divisions of Xu Kexiang, Mao Bingwen, Zhang Zhen, and Liu Heding under his command. Currently, Zhu plans to set up a Pacification Commissioner's Office in Fuzhou, with Mao's division advancing from Fuzhou to Yihuang and Nancheng, Xu's division advancing from Jishui to Ningdu and Ruijin, Zhang's division advancing from Longyan to Liancheng and Changting, and Liu's division advancing from Yanping to Shaowu and Guangze, converging on the Fujian-Jiangxi border, to attack the Zhu and Peng communist bandits who fled from Jiangxi, so that they will be attacked from both sides and have no way to escape. He himself will advance with the army and support the bandit suppression in Fujian. (December 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Sun Lianzhong Comes to Jinan from Jining <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Negotiates Defense Affairs and Downsizing with Han Fuju</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The 26th Route Army has been ordered to be stationed in western Shandong for nearly half a month, and the various divisions and brigades have arrived successively. Sun Lianzhong, the commander-in-chief of the route army, came to Jinan from Jining by special train at around 7:00 AM today (the 13th) to report on the relocation and discuss the downsizing issue. When the train arrived in Tai'an, the adjutant of Ma Hongkui telegraphed Jinan to report. Due to the late arrival of the telegram, Sun's special train arrived in Jinan at 3:20 PM, so no one from the military or government went to the station to welcome him. Only Cheng Jiaqi, the adjutant stationed at the station of the First Army Corps, was at the station to greet him. There were eight train carriages in total. Accompanying him were Sun's wife and Deng Yuexi, the captain of the messenger team of the General Headquarters, with more than twenty bodyguards carrying pistols. The luggage was extremely simple. I visited Sun on the special train and asked about the relocation of the unit. Sun said that Ji Zhentong's 14th Division, Gao Zhihe's Special Service Brigade, and the personnel of the General Headquarters had all arrived in Jining, and the General Headquarters had been set up there. Dong Zhentang's 13th Division arrived in Juye, Gao Shuxun's 12th Division arrived in Caozhou, Zhang Huatang's 1st Cavalry Division arrived in Dingtao, and Zhu Changde's 2nd Cavalry Division arrived in Caoxian. The defense area of the 15th Division is Juye, and only the advance unit has arrived. The army has been inspected by the Central Government, and the number of personnel is 47,000 and the number of guns is 37,000. I also asked about the mission of this trip to Jinan. Sun said that the army has been ordered to be under the command of Chairman Han and stationed in Shandong Province, so it is natural to have some contact with Chairman Han. This trip is firstly to report on the progress of the relocation and future joint defense issues, and secondly, because the army has too many personnel, it should be cut back to reduce the burden on the people now that the military affairs are over. The downsizing issue also needs to be discussed with Chairman Han. There will be no long delay on this trip, and he will return to his defense area in a few days to engage in downsizing, eliminating the weak and retaining the strong, and retraining them to become a national army. I also asked about the whereabouts of Feng Yuxiang. Sun said that he did not know the whereabouts of Mr. Feng. However, Vice Commander Zhang guaranteed that Mr. Feng would go abroad, and Mr. Feng was also very willing to go abroad. This matter is no longer a problem. Mr. Feng still has 30,000 remnants stationed in Jincheng and Quwo around Yuncheng. The Central Government has also decided on a way to deal with the remnants. After the conversation, Sun took a car to Qianfoshan to meet Han Fuju because Han was in Qianfoshan at the time. (13th)</p>

<h3 id="e66">Inauguration of the New Zhejiang Provincial Committee <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Nanxian, the new chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and committee members Zhang Naiyan, Jiang Bocheng, etc., came to Hangzhou recently after being appointed by the National Government. Yesterday, Zhang Nanxian and Jiang Bocheng went to the Provincial Party Headquarters to meet with the executive committee members, and the talks were very harmonious. This morning (16th) at 10:00 AM, an inauguration ceremony was held in the auditorium of the Provincial Government. About seven or eight hundred staff members of various agencies participated in the ceremony. The meeting began at 10:10 AM, presided over by Zheng Wenli, the President of the Higher Court. After the ceremony, Zhang Nanxian, Jiang Bocheng, Zhou Junyan, Zhang Naiyan, Fang Ce, Ye Zhuotang, and Wang Chengying raised their right hands to take the oath. Then Cai Yuanpei, the Central Supervising Committee Member, delivered a speech, saying that in the past, Comrade Zhang Jingjiang was very clean and honest in Zhejiang, very enthusiastic in his work, and willing to take responsibility. He was especially attentive to construction, and had overall plans for railways, highways, and electrical undertakings, which were being actively carried out. Unfortunately, he was physically weak and also served as the Chairman of the Central Construction Committee, so he was unwilling to continue serving as the Chairman of Zhejiang Province. The Central Government tried to retain him without success, so they carefully selected Comrade Zhang Nanxian to lead Zhejiang. He hoped that Chairman Zhang and the committee members would first strive to make the people live and work in peace and contentment, eliminate the communist bandits in the shortest possible time, and then complete the unfinished undertakings of the previous Zhang's construction plan and create what should be created, to create a model province. Next, Zheng Wenli, the Supervising Committee Member of the Executive Yuan, delivered a speech, and Ye Suzhong, the representative of the Provincial Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, the main idea of which was the same as Cai's. Finally, Zhang delivered a reply speech. The ceremony was completed at 12:00 PM. A group photo was taken in the back garden, and then a banquet with two tables was held in the reception hall of the Secretariat, inviting Cai and Zheng and the executive committee members of the Party Headquarters. Chairman Zhang then convened the secretaries and section chiefs of the Secretariat and the Civil Affairs Department in the afternoon, instructing them to inform the various sections and shares that, except for those with special responsibilities in their duties, please focus on their work.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Songjiang People Petition for Exemption from the Construction Bonds <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Geng Daochong and others from Songjiang petitioned the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Provincial Government to request exemption from the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Bonds, saying: Since the disaster of 1924, Songjiang County has been severely damaged. After the establishment of the National Government, there have been repeated orders to solicit the Two-Five Treasury Bonds, the Continued Two-Five Treasury Bonds, the 18th Year Customs Tax Reorganization, and the 19th Year Customs Tax, etc., with numerous items that are overwhelming. Mortgages and loans have exhausted all resources. Fortunately, unification has been achieved, and our common people hope that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of the People's Livelihood can be implemented. However, recently, it was read in the newspaper that the Jiangsu Provincial Government had passed the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Bonds of 7 million yuan, with the first issue of 4 million yuan, ordering all counties to actively solicit subscriptions. Songjiang County was assigned 80,000 yuan, which caused Daochong and others to be extremely shocked. Songjiang County has a small territory and has never had wealthy merchants who can control finance. The only thing the people rely on for their livelihood is the income from land production. In recent years, the income of landowners has been far less than before due to the implementation of rent reduction. In addition, tenants mistakenly believe in the fallacy that it is incompatible with the Three Principles of the People, delaying and waiting, and cunning people take the opportunity to incite and collectively resist rent. Landowners have retreated to a state of contraction and incompetence, and the rights they should enjoy have been deprived of. It is only feared that the collection agencies have not been able to understand the unlimited taking and unreported use. The state, provinces, and localities have repeatedly increased various taxes, both original and additional. Compared with the amount that should have been paid in the first year of the Republic of China, converted into silver dollars, the money has increased by three-tenths, and the rice has also increased by four-tenths. Income decreases day by day, and output increases day by day. Draining the pond to catch fish, the people are almost going to perish together. Not only that, but the various districts of Songjiang County have suffered from the strange disasters of rice borers gnawing year after year, and have also suffered the tragic disaster of robbery by bandits. Wealthy households in towns have moved away, and the savings of the small people in the villages are almost exhausted. Those who operate land are in danger of bankruptcy due to the low price of land, and those who do business find it difficult to find wealthy merchants due to the desolate market. If this environment is still considered an area of wealth and taxes, seeking without end, like adding depth to water and heat to fire, the heart of the court and the ministries of not bearing to see the suffering of others will also be unbearable to see and hear. Moreover, in terms of construction, from the 16th to the 19th year of the Republic of China, Songjiang County has added more than 100,000 yuan for construction fees attached to the grain item, and road construction fees collected on a special project basis. In addition, the two-corner-per-mu donation of the Farmers Bank is nearly 200,000 yuan, and the road construction labor expenses are several tens of thousands of yuan. The burden on the people of Songjiang is not insignificant. If it is apportioned again according to the number, how can it be tolerated? I read that Article 4 of the fifth day of the Fourth Plenary Session, regarding the construction of positive aspects, should be appropriately reduced or postponed, and the various departments should not issue bonds on the issues in charge. If the issued bonds have not been fully raised, they should be raised slowly, which has been revised and passed by the Assembly. Daochong and others believe that the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session are welcomed by the people, and the ministries and provinces should abide by them. Moreover, at this time of people's poverty and financial exhaustion, it is especially difficult to make up for one loss by creating another. We dare to jointly and sincerely request that the difficulties of the people be considered, and that the construction bonds apportioned this time be exempted from the departments, which is the convenience of the public.

<p>Oil Mill in Jinshanwei Robbed: The Tongxing Oil Mill in Jinshanwei, Punan, under the jurisdiction of the county, was suddenly attacked by 60 or 70 bandits at around 4:00 PM on the 14th. More than ten of them carried pistols and rushed in first. At that time, the oil mill workers were stopping work for dinner and were held up by the gun-wielding bandits, who fired a shot as a warning. Then, they broke into the accounting room, opened the iron box, and robbed more than 1,190 yuan in silver, more than 900 corners in small silver coins, and more than 10,000 copper coins. The bandits still wanted more and broke into the bedroom of Zhang Wenjie, the village head living next door, and robbed four gold rings and 200 yuan in cash. After the robbery, they threw away the deeds and books on the ground. At that time, two patrol boats of the Fourth Detachment of the Anti-Smuggling Team stationed at the old salt canal heard the alarm and attacked, but they were outnumbered and outgunned. One patrolman was killed and several long guns were taken away. Fortunately, the Weidongmen Defense Corps and the headquarters of the Fourth Detachment heard the report and led teams to fire and pursue the bandits in the direction north behind the town. The bandits then fled northwest with the stolen goods. Zhang Wenjie, the village head of the Youchefang Village in Jinshanwei of the 16th District, and Zhang Guoquan, the manager of the oil mill, came to Songjiang to report to the county court and request an investigation and arrest of the criminals.</p>

<p>Lake Bandits Holding Hostages, Lingering in West Mountain: The Water Police Third District reported via telephone from West Mountain at 2 PM yesterday (the 16th), stating that dozens of lake bandits, in five or six bandit boats, were holding five hostages from Tong'an Bridge, as well as multiple other hostages from other cases, and were anchored at the Three Mountains area of West Mountain, waiting for the respective families of the victims to prepare funds and come to redeem them. Furthermore, a telegram from Wu County stated that bandit gangs had been discovered in the Wu-Nong area at the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, requesting immediate dispatch of troops to suppress them. Upon receiving the telegram, District Chief Shen ordered the Eighth Water Police Team to go to West Mountain to rescue the hostages from danger, and also ordered Fourteenth Team Leader Xu to join forces with the Guerrilla Unit to head to Wu-Nong to encircle and suppress the bandits.</p>
<p>Removal and Prosecution of Water Police Squad Leader Yu: An elderly woman, Qian Lu, of Zhou Sidun Village, Nanbei Bridge, was targeted for theft last month by thieves Chen Agou and Jin A Jin, who failed in their attempt to steal but strangled Qian Lu to death with a rope. The local court first apprehended Chen Agou and dealt with him according to the law. Subsequently, Jin A Jin was captured by the First Squad of the Eleventh Water Police Team stationed in Fan Huang Dai. However, A Jin managed to escape. Later, the local court sent a letter to the Water Police Third District requesting the extradition of the criminal for verification by the court. District Chief Shen, upon receiving the letter, stated that Jin A Jin had already escaped without a trace. He then ordered Eleventh Team Leader Pei to place the squad leader, Yu Hongxun, under custody. Yesterday, Yu was transferred to the local court. Prosecutor Lu opened the court for investigation and, suspecting Yu Hongxun of taking bribes to release the suspect, ordered his detention. As for the Water Police District Chief Shen, considering that Squad Leader Yu had indeed engaged in illegal and derelict behavior, he had already ordered his dismissal to await investigation and prosecution by the court according to law.</p>

<p>Moral Learning Society Investigated, Dragon Chair Found: On the day before yesterday (the 11th) in this county, a certain Duan claiming to be a teacher of the Moral Learning Society suddenly came and held a meeting at the Zhou God Temple in the city. The decorations in the meeting were all like the former Qing Dynasty palace, with dragon chairs, dragon flags, and Bagua signs. Over the past few days, a total of three to four hundred men and women have attended the meeting. At around 9 PM on the 14th, someone went to the county party headquarters to secretly report that the Moral Learning Society was holding a secret gathering at the Zhou God Temple late at night. The county party headquarters then joined forces with dozens of police officers from the First Garrison Station, led by Shi Minyong, the supervisory committee member of the county party headquarters, and entered through the front door. At the document office, they found countless documents and a roster of members, with a total of more than 160 people signing. There was also a roster of welcomed people, with more than 260 people signing. Some old women and laborers were left there to guard the place. Then they went to the document office and found more than 200 bookcases. The books contained words such as "Permanent Moral Peace." There was also a society fee book, stating that joining the society required paying four yuan. Supervisor Shi immediately ordered everyone not to move and sat guard there. Shen Zuxian, the Minister of Propaganda of the county party headquarters, entered through the back door and went straight to the upper floor. He saw a room in the west that seemed quite secret, with a silk curtain on the door with the words "Only I am God" written on it. Shen went to the place and met a servant who said that the room was the bedroom of Counselor Tang. He was asked to get up, and a business card was produced with the words "Tang Zhi" printed on it, with the title "Counselor of the National Government" on the right. Another person produced a card with the words "Chen Mingge" printed on it, with the title "Major General Secretary of the General Affairs Section of the National Army Reorganization Committee". As for the so-called teacher Duan, his whereabouts were unknown. Then, according to Tang and Chen, they were officials of the National Government and were familiar with Duan. They had come here for sightseeing. As for the Moral Learning Society, it was religious in nature and had no other function. At that time, Shen Shi and others believed that the society had not been registered, and the fact that it was holding a secret gathering late at night was certainly suspicious, and they had to go to the county government to handle the matter. However, Tang Chen and others refused to go. Then, Wang Kunshan, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, also rushed to the scene. As a result, they were persuaded to go to the county government to meet with County Chief Tan for further disposal. Tang Chen then agreed. At this time, the police officers of the Public Security Bureau searched everywhere. Dozens of villagers were found in the downstairs room, and some books were also found on them. They were immediately detained in the Public Security Bureau for temporary custody. Then the party officials and Director Wang, etc., accompanied Chen and Tang to the county government. First, Supervisor Shi described the search and arrest process. Then, County Chief Tan asked Tang and Chen and asked for evidence of their status as officials of the National Government. They took out the National Government access pass (with a hard seal) and symbol badges, etc. County Chief Tan said, since you have come, why didn't you ask for protection? Holding a secret gathering late at night, and asked whether they could be responsible for the Moral Learning Society. Tang Chen replied that they could only prove it, not be responsible, and also said that there were other founders in Changshu, such as Jin Yiming. That night, the two were sent back, but the police were sent to guard the front and back doors to monitor them. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the Provincial Party Consolidation Committee and the Department of Civil Affairs for instructions. The next morning, the villagers (or disciples and members) in custody were voluntarily surrendered by the founder Jin Yiming, who was willing to take responsibility alone and requested that the villagers who had been detained yesterday be released. The county government then released a group of people, and Jin Yiming was ordered to be released on bail by the Erjiapu. Only teacher Duan's whereabouts were unknown. On the same day, all the furnishings at the society site were removed. On the afternoon of the 15th, Tang and Chen sent a telegram to Beijing to prove their identity and asked Qian Changzhao (a local) to prove it from the National Government Secretariat. The People's Education Center engaged in reforming prisoners: Yao Yi, the jailer and warden of the detention center in this county, recently felt that it was urgent to find ways to reform the detainees. On the 10th, he sent a letter to Yuan Shizhong, director of the Central First People's Education Center, requesting that staff be sent to give lectures in the prison every Sunday to reform them. On the 14th, Director Yuan specially sent Gui Zhi of the Museum Department and Hua Yunsheng of the Lecture Department to give the first lecture at the East and West prisons in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Water Police Relocating, Residents Retaining: The Thirteenth Water Public Security Team stationed in this county is divided into three squads. Except for the Second Squad stationed in the urban area, the rest are stationed in townships and towns. The Third Squad headquarters moved from Dongtang City to Baimao Town this spring for the convenience of responding to emergencies. Because it is close to the coast, bandits are easy to come and go. It was recently heard that Dianyukou needs to dispatch two patrol boats. At the request of Dongtang City, it is proposed to move the team headquarters back to the original defense area on an appointed day. However, the residents of Baimao believe that the river defense is important and should not be allowed to go elsewhere, and they have convened a meeting and elected representatives to go to the county government and the Thirteenth Team headquarters to request a postponement of the discussion.</p>

<p>Department Order to Investigate Grass Camp Death Case: On October 13, Cao Yangfang, head of the fifth district security team of Shengang, reported by Detective Wu Hao that he had captured Jiang Shun, Sheng Xi Binggen and Wu Yongzhen for alleged involvement in the Xie Fulin family kidnapping. The three were taken into custody, and Jiang was shot and killed at night for attempting to escape. His father, Jiang Zian, stated that although his son had always been unruly, he only committed petty theft. The reason for this shooting was that Song Guanren, Mao Xihong and others in the village had conspired to raise hundreds of silver dollars, bribed Commander Cao, falsely accused him of being a bandit, falsely claimed that he was trying to escape, and shot him on the evening of October 17. Zhang Chunhong was unwilling to pay 30 yuan, and accused them of treating human life like grass and filed a complaint with the Department of Civil Affairs. After receiving the report, the Department of Civil Affairs ordered the Jiangyin County to investigate. County Chief Li ordered the police to summon a group of witnesses, scheduled for interrogation on the 17th. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff had fled.

It was recently learned that Wu was arrested and taken to the team, where he was tied up tightly and whipped arbitrarily. At the same time, sentries were placed everywhere to cut off pedestrians to prevent leakage of information. After a neighbor secretly informed the Sixth District Office, Jia, a special affairs officer of the regiment headquarters, was sent to investigate and mediate the matter slightly, and Wu was released. Unexpectedly, after Wu was released and returned to the bureau, the team leader led more than 70 armed team members to Lifaq Town, threatening Wu to hand over 59 people who had been friends with Liu and Zhao. He said that unless two people were shot or 3,000 yuan was handed over, otherwise the guarantors would be handed over one by one and shot immediately. Fortunately, Wu pleaded repeatedly to avoid the disaster. It was recently learned that Wu has also reported the bizarre incident to the County Public Security Bureau. The people in the area had planned to take action after the incident, but because the team leader was violent, their lives were in danger once they took action, so they dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Zhou Investigates Jailbreak Case: The Jiangdu County Court Detention Center had a jailbreak during the Mid-Autumn Festival of the lunar calendar, with 40 or 50 important unjudged prisoners escaping. Except for a dozen or so who were captured on the spot with the help of the county government, the rest have not been captured so far. The High Court believed that Chen Quan, the director of the detention center, was suspected of taking bribes, so it transferred the case to the Zhenjiang Local Court for handling. Prosecutor Zhou Erkai was assigned by the Prosecutor's Office of the court to investigate. Unexpectedly, when the court transferred Chen to Zhen, he suddenly escaped on the way, making it impossible to investigate. It was recently heard that the prosecutor, especially yesterday (the 15th), accompanied Secretary Wang Xia to Yangzhou and went to the detention center to interrogate each of the prisoners who had escaped and been recaptured, and inquired about whether the director and guards of the detention center had taken bribes when they planned to escape that day.

<p>To the Editor: I recently read a communication from Jiangyin in your newspaper on the 15th, which stated that County Chief Li personally investigated the case of the branch bureau chief arbitrarily adjudicating a soil case. This does not conform to the facts. On the 10th of this month, when our bureau sent police to inspect the inn, we found Jiang Fuxiang, a native of Xiagang, in this county, in the Yingbin Inn, accompanied by a woman from Henan, Li, pretending to be a couple. However, the language of the two parties was incompatible. The patrol captain took the police to the bureau, and the two people's words were still inconsistent after the bureau chief's preliminary interrogation. Then, in accordance with Article 43, Item 1 of the Arrest Police Law, they were each sentenced to 15 days of detention and held in custody. Later, they were bailed out by local shops. Unexpectedly, Jiang Fuxiang was reported to the county government by someone else, claiming to be a soil dealer. Then the county chief and the chief of the Public Security Bureau personally went to Yingbin Jin to investigate and brought the persons involved to the government for interrogation by the chief of the Public Security Bureau. As for the fine imposed on Jiang Fuxiang by our bureau, it was because he violated the behavior of being untidy in his whereabouts, not because of a soil case. I am writing to ask you to check and correct the record. Cui Siping, Chief of the First Branch of the Jiangyin Public Security Bureau, December 15.</p>

<p>Director Chen is Currently in Ganzhou: Chen, Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, went to Beijing last Saturday evening to discuss important official matters. He originally planned to stay for a few days and then return. However, due to a telegram from President Jiang of the National Government from Ganzhou, he took a plane to Jiujiang on the morning of the 12th. Chen did not telegraph the Education Department from Wuhan to instruct the departments to expedite the completion of the backlog. It is now learned that the reason for the Education Department to handle the backlog is that it is settling the handled items during the reorganization of the provincial government, and that Director Chen was transferred by the central government to be the permanent deputy minister of the Education Department, so he cleared up the backlog in advance. It is not yet known when the new director will take over.</p>
<h3 id="e83">First Day of the Jiangsu Experimental Elementary School Joint Conference <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Held Opening Ceremony... Reports from Various Groups and Sections</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Experimental Elementary School Joint Conference, after a resolution by the Executive Committee to hold the fourth plenary session, held the opening ceremony at 9:00 AM on the 15th of this month at the Zhenzhong Experimental Elementary School in Bamen Lane, Zhenjiang, as well as an expanded Commemoration Week. Attendees included 35 people such as Xie Shouxian and Yu Gancheng from Zhenzhong Experimental Elementary School, and 135 people from 28 schools including Hu Shuyi and Jin Lunhai from Nanjing Girls' High School Experimental Elementary School, Wei Dunyi, Gu Pin yue, Song Huaichu, Zhou Jianxi, Ma Ketan and Ding Shuming from Nanzhong Experimental Elementary School, Gao Shijun and Huang Jianbai, Shi Renfu and Chen Bangyan from Suzhong Experimental Elementary School. The chairman was Xie Shouxian from Zhenzhong Elementary School, and the recorder was Zhang Danyuan from Zhenzhong Elementary School. (1) Opening of the meeting; (2) Singing of the Party song; (3) Paying the highest respects to the Party, the national flag, and the portrait of the Premier; (4) The chairman respectfully reading the Premier's will; (5) Silent tribute; (6) The chairman reported that before the work report, he would like to say a few words. This conference is held in our school, gathering all the comrades from elementary schools in the province. This is a very rare opportunity. What is worth celebrating is that our school is scheduled to hold a welcome reception this afternoon, and take the opportunity to hold the completion ceremony of the new classrooms and the establishment ceremony of the kindergarten enclosure. Please come and give us your guidance. However, our school is short of staff and has many affairs, so we may not be able to provide adequate hospitality. We hope for your understanding.</p>
<p>(7) Work reports from various sections and groups:</p>
<p>(1) The Executive Committee Standing Committee reported that in the past year and a half, it had held five executive committee meetings, four principals' meetings, and one temporary general meeting. In terms of documents, it had submitted 21 documents to the Central University Administrative Council, 5 documents to the Education Department, 4 documents to the Provincial Government, and 2 documents to the Ministry of Education. In terms of received documents, there were 19 directives from the Central University Administrative Council, 2 directives from the Education Department, and 1 approval from the Provincial Government. As for finances, there is currently a deficit of forty to fifty yuan, not including the expenses for this conference. Therefore, please pay the outstanding membership fees as soon as possible for application.</p>
<p>(2) The Executive Committee Research Group reported that this group was previously responsible for the new elementary school curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education for experimental education in various schools. For detailed information, please refer to the written report to save time. (3) The Executive Committee Publicity Group reported that the affairs of this group were undertaken by our school (Nanzhong Elementary School) and Nanjing Girls' High School Elementary School as recommended by the previous conference. Now, a summary of the work over the past year is reported to the conference as follows. Regarding publicity work, there should be three aspects. One is to have permanent publicity, such as publishing publications, etc., which has been discussed with the Shanghai Commercial Press and can be said to be in order. One is temporary publicity, which has been discussed with major newspapers such as Shanghai Shenxin, asking them to assist in publicity. Another is entrusted to this group by the conference. For example, the previous conference entrusted this group to find ways to contact children's newspapers. This group has contacted the Central Daily News and the Cultural Daily News in Nanjing, which are more established, to publish children's weeklies, which have now been published. This is an overview of the work of this group over the past year.</p>
<p>(4) The Editorial Committee of the Regular Publication reported that the third issue of Elementary School Education was edited by our school (Shang Gong) on a rotational basis. Solicitation of manuscripts began in May of this year, but very few manuscripts have been received, so the Commercial Press cannot undertake the printing. Please contribute more manuscripts so that it can be printed within this semester.</p>
<p>(5) The Testing Group reported that please refer to the written report of our school (Central University Experimental School).</p>
<p>(6) The Local Education Guidance Group reported that the overview of the work of this group over the past year is as follows: (A) The biggest difference between the local education guidance methods promulgated by the Education Department and the previous ones is the designation of special funds and the special establishment of local education instructors. However, due to the initial management's opinion on the increase in budget, there were slight disagreements, so the implementation of each school was delayed. Some have plans, and some have not yet recommended specialists to start work. The reason why our school (Tongzhong Elementary School) cannot conduct important investigations and research is this. (B) The most difficult thing for each school in the methods promulgated by the Education Department is the inconvenience of the district routes. Regarding this level, our school still troubles the Education Department to re-divide the area according to the district routes of elementary school teachers certified by the former Central University Administrative Council. However, according to the personnel in charge of the Education Department, the districts in the Department are distributed according to the number of schools in each county to facilitate adjustment, in addition to the routes.</p>
<p>(7) The Teacher Training Internship Guidance Group reported that the schools in charge of this group are Nanjing Girls' High School Elementary School, Nanjing Elementary School, and Suzhou Elementary School. After contacting the three schools once, our school (Nanjing Girls' High School Elementary School) was recommended to report. (1) The importance of this group: (1) This group is the key to the connection between middle schools and elementary schools. Since the reorganization of the affiliated elementary schools of various normal schools in the province into experimental elementary schools, the relationship between the middle school normal departments and the experimental elementary schools is entirely in the teacher training internship aspect. Therefore, the teacher training internship guidance issue must be resolved definitively. (2) This group is one of the three major functions of experimental elementary schools. There are three functions of experimental elementary schools in this province, and guiding teacher training internships is one of its major functions. Therefore, there must be a precise and concrete method for teacher training internships. (2) The process of research. The three schools are described separately as follows. (1) Nanjing Elementary School's research on this issue. A kind of teacher training internship method specially compiled and printed is displayed at the venue for the conference to study. (2) Suzhou Elementary School issued a questionnaire in the last semester to investigate the internship guidance methods of each school, but only eight schools received it, so it was impossible to conduct statistical reports. (3) Nanjing Girls' High School Elementary School has compiled and printed a detailed method for this issue, the Outline for Visiting Teacher Training Internships and the Internship Curriculum Standards compiled by Hu Shuyi, which will be published by the Ministry of Education soon.</p>
<p>(8) The Elementary School Curriculum Research Group reported that our school (Taizhong Elementary School) believes that the transformation of the elementary school curriculum should take children's lives and social life as the goal, group activities as the means, and children's activities as the process. Therefore, we are now overturning subjects and replacing them with two types of central activities and free activities. Central activities are equivalent to the design of large units, divided into fixed and temporary types. There are eight fixed centers throughout the year, taking into account the four aspects of social science, business, recreation, and life. Temporary centers are determined by children's self-initiative. Free activities are a type of work determined by children themselves or predetermined and announced by teachers, which is different every day and every week. Children choose and recognize them themselves. Our school uses this proposition to transform the curriculum. Two of the eight fixed centers have already been implemented. Our school has put the actual activities and materials on display at the exhibition venue. The remaining six have also predetermined the materials and put them on display separately. If you want to know more details, you can refer to the printed materials and activity results distributed by our school.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Words of Wisdom from Yiqian <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Be forgiving in all things. This is to teach us how to treat others, not to indulge ourselves.</p>
<p>When forgiveness is applied to others, it can also benefit oneself. When forgiveness is demanded of others, only one's own faults are seen.</p>
<p>There are many remarks that can only be made for others, not used for oneself.</p>
<p>There are also many events that can only be used to praise others, not to demand of others.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with how others treat you, then you must be cautious in how you treat others.</p>
<p>Between each other, it is always good to compare one's own heart with the hearts of others, and then the mood will naturally be calm.</p>
<p>In dealing with others, be afraid that people will not expect extravagance from me. In expecting from others, always be wary of desires being too excessive.</p>
<p>All wrongdoings have a source. But to blame them for their mistakes may not necessarily prompt them to change. To investigate its source is the only way to enable people to reform themselves.</p>
<p>When you feel that people's hearts are different, instead of recklessly blaming them, it is better to look for the reasons for the difference.</p>
<p>Accept both praise and criticism with restraint. One is afraid that the criticism is not severe enough, and the other is afraid that the praise is too excessive.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Party Doctrine Speech by Ms. Ye Hua <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Our country is like a broken boat with shattered sails. It can remain unharmed largely thanks to the Premier’s doctrine. However, before the windows and doors are complete, there is always the worry of the dangers of wind and rain. The Party Headquarters is most responsible to the Party and the country. The efforts and progress of all comrades can be said to be exhaustive. The Shanghai Party Headquarters, even amidst the year-end busyness, "held a primary school student party doctrine speech contest." It is truly a deeply considered and far-sighted plan. The fourteenth of the month was the day of the final. The venue was the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which was spacious and held about eight hundred listeners. Around the perimeter stood Girl Scouts from the Chinese Women's Physical Education School, wearing round hats and red jackets, yellow shirts and yellow pants, like the royal guards of Western countries, adding much color. I will record what I saw and heard that day on the left.</p>
<p>Drawing Lots Before the Premier's Portrait: A total of sixty-one people participated in the speech competition, drawn from municipal schools and registered private schools. Preliminary rounds were held in three groups starting on the tenth, producing eighteen finalists from each group, who were the speakers on that day. Before the speeches began, Comrade Zhu Jiarang gathered the speakers under the stage before the Premier's portrait to draw lots to determine the order of speeches. The lots were made of chopsticks and placed in a tube, in size, style, and color just like the efficacious lucky sticks in front of the City God in the City God Temple. As the students crowded to draw lots, Mr. Zhou from the Education Bureau whispered to Pan Gongzhan, saying, "They are drawing lots before the Premier's portrait; their fate may be foretold by this." It is a pity that the Premier has no fortune verses to calm their minds. Those who heard laughed. Even Comrades Wu Kaixian and Tao Baichuan, who usually kept their heads down and did not speak, laughed heartily.</p>
<p>Speaking Without Knowing How to Speak: After Chairman Tong Xingbai finished his report, Party Representative Pan Gongzhan gave a speech. Then, Mr. Zhou Shang, the representative of the Municipal Education Bureau, gave a speech. Zhou opened his speech by saying, "It is already a joke for someone who does not know how to give a speech to attend a speech meeting. It is even more absurd for someone who does not know how to give a speech to give another speech. Truly a strange tale! Fortunately, I did not come here voluntarily but was forced to come. I hope you will not view it as a joke or a strange tale. So, can the reasons for not being able to speak be heard? They are: not proficient in the national language; schools lack opportunities; society forbids speaking; the written language is 'zhi hu zhe ye' (classical Chinese particles) instead of 'de le ni wo ta' (modern Chinese pronouns); and political and legal autocracy. Even casual talk is punished, so there is no room for speeches. There are not many orators in Chinese history. Although there were persuasive speakers during the Warring States period and elegant debaters during the Six Dynasties, there were none like Cicero or Lincoln, except for our Premier. He used the power of speech to explain doctrine and awaken the masses. I deeply hope that the children will emulate the Premier and use speech as the first step in saving and building the country."</p>
<p>Striving and Efforts of the Three Principles of the People: When the students stepped onto the stage, they could not help but feel uneasy and cautious in their hearts. However, on the outside, they were mostly calm and composed, speaking fluent national language and flowing eloquently, leaving people deeply impressed. The reporter and his colleagues Fei Kunnian, Shi Yixuan, Guo Guangji, and Wang Jie agreed to count the number of times the words "Three Principles of the People," "striving," and "efforts" appeared in each person's speech. The speaker who mentioned "Three Principles of the People" the most said it twenty-four times, while the fewest said it three times, averaging seven times per person. The word "striving" was mentioned sixteen times at most and two times at least, averaging five times per person. "Efforts" was mentioned nineteen times at most and three times at least, averaging four times per person. Other words like "Premier," "Father of the Nation," "Mr. Sun Yat-sen," "revolution," "saving the country," and "building the country" were also common, but not as frequent or widespread as the three categories mentioned above.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Recording an Old Student's Hard Work at Chi Chih <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Chi Chih College on Jiangwan Road in this city is a well-known private university in Shanghai. It was organized with departments of Arts, Commerce, and Law. Due to regulations from the Ministry of Education, it was renamed to its current name. Hu Puan, Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, presides over the Department of Sinology. Its achievements are particularly notable. For example, Ms. Chen Naiwen, the current professor of literature at Pei Cheng Girls' School and others, is an outstanding graduate of Chi Chih and a favorite student of Director Hu. Furthermore, the Chi Chih basketball team is also famous throughout the country. This semester, an old student, about fifty years old, is studying in the Department of Sinology. His general situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Purpose of Studying: The old student's surname and given name are unknown. It is said that he is from Hunan Province. Because the communists were disturbing his home, he moved frequently. Before he could catch his breath, he had to move again. Helpless, the old student resolutely came to Shanghai to temporarily avoid the conflict. Later, due to the high cost of living in Shanghai, he recalled his admiration for Chi Chih in Hunan. He secretly thought that it would be better to study than to sit idle in a hostel. Therefore, he registered and was admitted to the school.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Diligence and Thrift: The old student is not one who is penniless. He has some property. Usually, he wears cloth clothes and cloth shoes, still the original style of the countryside. He works and rests like other students every day. However, he is not good at sports. After class and meals, he often puts his hands behind his back and leisurely strolls around the school grounds, using this to relieve his worries. Although his beard and hair are gray, his spirit is vigorous, not inferior to the young. He listens attentively to the lectures and is determined to learn. The professors all praise him. It is said that he enrolled as a first-year student. Young people who aim high and far seem to feel ashamed when they see him.</p>
<p>Mutual Reflection: Chi Chih has an old student, and Zhengfeng College of Arts also has an old student. The difference is that the one at Zhengfeng only takes a course in Buddhism. This old man has no beard, but he is probably over fifty years old. Some say that he came to worship Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang's Buddhism. His words are quite close to the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Celebrating Mother's Birthday at the Brahma Palace by Sheng Ying <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Shen Youyu, named Shishan and also known as Tuotuo, is a former teacher who is now an official and brings benefits wherever he goes. His family is known for its beautiful gardens. Due to unrest, he has taken residence in Shanghai. He calls his residence Haishu Building. He honors his mother by writing books and not asking about current affairs. Mr. Huang Zongyan wrote a postscript for the building, comparing it to Su Can's Hai Zang and Mei Sou's Hai Ri, which is truly fitting. He is skilled in poetry and prose and also loves calligraphy and painting. Last winter, for his mother's eightieth birthday, he refused gifts and, with his brother Zhiping, spent a large sum of money paving the stone road in their hometown, which the villagers appreciated. Recently, on his mother's birthday again, he specially borrowed the hall of the Brahma Palace to display eighty paintings of congratulatory themes collected over the year. He arranged an exhibition and invited famous calligraphers and painters to appreciate them. I personally attended the event and saw the walls filled with beautiful and vibrant works. The paintings were four-foot vertical scrolls, all uniformly mounted, including landscapes, flowers, figures, ladies, birds, animals, insects, orchids, and bamboo, both meticulous and freehand, all complete and exquisite. In addition to more than thirty famous artists from Shanghai, there were also works from various provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan. Within this province, the majority came from Lanling, Liangxi, and Suzhou. Works by ladies and outsiders were arranged in a separate section, truly a grand sight, opening a new era of birthday celebrations. The guests included Pan Lanshi, Wang Yiting, Shang Shengbo, Shen Xinhai, Tang Dongfu, Xie Gongzhan, Hu Tinglu, Wang Shizi, Wang Leixia, Hong Lisheng, Zheng Wuchang, Ma Mengrong, Ma Daiyun, Ma Wanli, Chen Gangshu, Xie Xianou, Wu Qinmu, Yao Mocun, Zha Yangu, Guan Futing, Ding Shaoshi, Xu Muru, Xu Zhengbai, Xu Zhongqi, Lu Danlin, Zhu Rongzhuang, Tang Linze, and Wang Geyi, among others, more than seventy people in all, gathered together, toasting and conversing. After drinking, they took up their brushes and collaborated on several paintings to commemorate the occasion. It is said that Mr. Shen is still planning to collect a hundred paintings and have them printed. This gathering not only provided the joy of friends coming together but also celebrated his mother's joy and created an example for the art world.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Dissecting the Flower Gambling and Talking About the Ice Heart <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Everyone knows the harm of flower gambling. Those who talk about it change color in disgust, but those who are deluded by it are willing to risk their lives and property for it. It is indeed so. My friend Yichuan told me yesterday two recent anecdotes about flower gambling. Although I know that the speaker is earnest, and the listeners are indifferent, I dare not but do my best since there is an opportunity to speak. Moreover, this publication has a wide circulation and may provide a little help to those who have lost their way. These are my unwavering views.</p>
<p>Novel Drinking Games: Yichuan was invited to a banquet last Wednesday by his sworn brother, Mr. Henai. Halfway through the drinking, Mrs. Henai, Ms. So-and-so, brought out drinking tokens stored in a ivory tube. The tube was filled with several ivory sticks carved very exquisitely. However, the carvings were all so-called gods of flower gambling. Thus, they were randomly used. Mrs. Henai and Ms. Jinyang, who was at the same table, described the harms of flower gambling as follows.</p>
<p>Tragedy of Drawing Water with a Bucket: There was a certain lady who lost her mother early and had no choice but to depend on her stepmother. She was ignorant of joy and sorrow in her early years. As she grew older, she was mistreated by her stepmother. However, although the lady was young, she could perceive what her stepmother liked. If she had a dream at night or heard or saw something in the morning, she would tell her stepmother. It was often accurate. In terms of money, she was surprisingly loved as if she were her own daughter. One day, the mother dreamed of drawing water from a well. In the morning, she asked her daughter. The daughter had heard the neighbors say that anyone who could not afford to seal a package would use dreams to predict. A neighbor happened to arrive and said, "Last night I dreamed of drawing water from a well, and the bucket going up and down like an axis." The daughter said, "I believe it. The flower gambling opens three times a day. The earliest one is suspended overnight, called 'diaotong' (drawing bucket), which is the fairest and without bias. Now my mother and the neighbor have both dreamed like this. You will surely win the early round." The mother believed it but did not win. The loss was even greater. The mother was resentful. The daughter was very frightened. She went to the back garden and grabbed the bucket hanging over the well and smashed it. She said, "Since things have no spirit, why do you come into my dreams to burden me?" She threw the bucket into the well. Unexpectedly, she was so angry that she used too much force, causing the bucket to separate from the rope. She worried that her mother might need to draw water and would not be able to find the bucket, and the blame would be on her. She took off her clothes and entered the well to search for it. One slip and she could never come out again. A younger sister witnessed this and ran to tell her mother. The mother said, "She brought it on herself. She deserves to die." She retrieved the body and gave it a simple burial. This happened ten days ago, as described by Ms. Jinyang.</p>
<p>Must Get Longevity: In flower gambling, there is something called "bide" (must get). A village scholar was old. In the era of the imperial examination, he had been an official performer. In recent years, the trend in academia has turned to science, and the scholar has become more and more frustrated and bored. In recent years, a friend took him to a gambling den to be the record keeper (in rural gambling dens, there must be someone to keep records), and he shared some of the profits. He accumulated two hundred Buddhas (currency). Recently, he heard people talk about the magic of flower gambling and saw how people made money by interpreting dreams. He was quite moved. One night, he dreamed that the school inspector came to examine him and gave him the sentence "must get longevity." He was overjoyed when he woke up. He used a large sum of ten yuan to bet on the "must get" door. When the results were announced, he was just having dinner. With a "kang le" sound (lost), he was greatly disappointed. The rice stuck in his throat, and he was choked for a long time. He failed to get his longevity. His family wept, but it was too late. This happened within the past month, as described by Mrs. Henai.</p>
<p>Elegant Joking Echoes: Yichuan also said that Mrs. Henai made this drinking token fifteen years ago. At that time, her husband had a mistress. Mrs. Henai made this token to play a nighttime game. Whoever won would spend the night. If everyone won, then one husband and two wives would drink and make merry all night without sleeping. If no one won, then the husband would be banished to sleep in the outer wing. That day, the drinking game was played again. The lady was also present, and she was already past her prime. The female guests who knew about it still used it to joke with her.</p>

<p>Chapter Sixteen: Earnestly Asking for Words, Cui Xiu Visits the Teacher; Generously Discussing Military Affairs, a Female Hero is Feted in a Brothel</p>
<p>Anything that can make people numb is easy to become an addiction. If you can control yourself, that's fine. Otherwise, you will become obsessed, which is only natural. But the fundamental point is that if you can control yourself, you won't be intoxicated by it. Therefore, people who drink only have three or four cups at first, but later they become incapable of returning home unless they are drunk. Smokers initially only have one or two cigarettes after meals, but later they smoke one after another, smoking several cans of cigarettes a day. Opium is even more unnecessary to mention. At first, they only smoke a few puffs in a friend's opium den, feeling extremely comfortable in their chest and muscles. Later, they become drowsy in the haze of opium, leading to ruin and impoverishment. People become like ghosts, unable to control themselves. Since Zuo Shichen was infatuated with Green Seclusion, he felt lost and aimless if he didn't go to Little Flower Garden for a few days. It seemed like he had become addicted. At the end of last year, Cui Yun had remarried. It was said that her new husband was a businessman from Shanghai. In terms of status, he was far inferior to the previous comprador of the steamship company. However, he had never been married and was still young, only twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old. Zuo Shichen joked with Cui Yun, saying, "You have experience now. People say, 'Learn a lesson from suffering once.' You should investigate carefully. The hearts of people outside are very bad now. Don't have something like a friend's wife flirting with you again." Cui Yun said, "There is no such coincidence." Therefore, after Cui Yun remarried, he had one less place to go. The saying "single prostitution and double gambling" is the worst thing. What is meant by "double gambling"? Whenever someone goes to gamble alone, they lack interest and courage. If someone next to them encourages them, and they have a companion, they will immediately go. If both of them win after going, they will naturally be very happy and come again the next day. If both of them lose, they will discuss how to make a comeback. Among the two, one wins and one loses, and the loser can ask the winner for help. As for "single prostitution," it is even more objectionable. For example, if you go to a brothel together, you can only go together and leave together. All kinds of love talk and things like that are not good to be self absorbed when a friend is there, and neglect the friend. Single prostitution is going alone, called "duliao" (slipping away alone). Sometimes they even hide it from their friends and do it privately. Originally, there should be no third party between a man and a woman. If there is a friend who is annoying and sticks to them, they will feel oppressed. Zuo Shichen never went to Green Ripple at Little Flower Garden alone. It was always Long Ziyun, Lin Fanzi, or Ling Zhixiang. After dinner, they would go there to sit. Occasionally, when they were in high spirits, they would invite a few people to play small mahjong and have them prepare some dishes. The cost was not much. Later, Green Ripple suddenly installed a telephone. In the past, it was not as common for brothels to install telephones as it is now. After installing the telephone, their user name was not even listed in the telephone directory.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Financial Swap: Gold Market Rushes Madly <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>February Contract Extremely Popular: The gold price situation yesterday, December 16, once again showed soaring momentum. Coinciding with the official start of swaps on the exchange, it opened half an hour early at 8:30 AM. The swap was vastly different from before and was posted by the bulls, due to the lack of receivers of spot goods. According to yesterday's report, the initial estimate in the morning was around four taels inside and outside, then three taels, five or six mace, and three taels and six mace according to the listing price. At noon, it was only two taels, four or five mace. However, there was no excessive change in the market this time. The Dalian gang and Hengxing Shengda were mostly short, while Yuanxing Yongyongheng was mostly long. As for the January contract, it was usually not traded and was mostly changed to the February contract. The opening price was 633 taels and 9 mace, and the morning close was 641 taels and 2 mace. This was based on the February contract as the standard, and it had risen 10 taels and 1 mace compared to the day before. The afternoon market had canceled the listing price. It was said that the February contract was already on the market. The market momentum was unstoppable, and it was about to break through the 650 taels mark. However, the turbulence was extremely turbulent, rising and falling sharply. The chaotic state could not be suppressed. The ups and downs of four or five taels in a moment were extremely frightening and difficult to handle. There were a total of ten taels of changes throughout the day. The buying interest among the trade was strong. Yongfeng, Yongheng, Yuanmao Yong, and speculators were all scrambling to buy, while Xinfeng Yifengyong and others were selling. Although the overseas silver market did not rise much, the gold price opened high, then flattened. The exchange rate felt quite beautiful afterward, but the listing price was lengthened by half a grade and was unmoved. It was said to be clearly loose but secretly tight, and the big players in the market were scrambling to buy, and the momentum was increasing day by day. The sharp rise of ten taels and the subsequent market was even more auspicious. However, there was a 3 or 4 tael consolidation, and then a new record of 653 taels and 8 mace was discovered. If this continues, the rising wind does not know where it will end, and international finance may have unlimited impact. It is said that the major gold bars may still have a tendency to fall back this morning.</p>
<p>Huge Storms from Time to Time: The February contract initially opened at 637 taels and a half in the morning (a gross profit of around 37 taels, not much trading). The major gold bars only lengthened by one-sixteenth, the silver price increased by three-eighths, and the private telegraph also increased by 375. However, people's hearts were still firm, so it was not affected. Then, Yongheng and others bought in, and it was increased to 39 taels, 12 mace. Suddenly, Zhifeng Yifengyong and others sold out, and the daily gold seemed to be loose. Huabi entered the spot contract with only 1 tael, 3 mace, 7 fen, and 75 li, and the March British gold could be settled at 1575, so the price plummeted by more than 5 taels. At 9:15, it was 33 taels and a half, and it was pushed up by four or five taels at a time, because the exchange rate rebounded. The banks were doing recent daily gold for 1 tael, 3 mace, 8 fen, 125 li, and the goods and other items came in, so the first order was announced at 39 taels. However, the listing price was lengthened by 125, the US gold was suppressed by a small 875, but the internal gold was not loose, and the March British gold was doing 156875, and Huabi came out with 15625, causing the gold price to rise again and continue to increase by more than 3 taels. At 10:00, it was 42 taels and 675. Huabi Bank absorbed March 15625 and sold it for hedging. Tong Taichang also sold it, which was good because the forward British gold could be done with 625 in and out. In a moment, a storm broke out, falling by 5 taels, but there was only one tael of rise and fall. At 10:45, it was 37 taels, 45 mace. At this time, Yongheng Taiheng Yuan and retail investors were scrambling to buy, and the exchange market was also sharp. Huabi Sumitomo mutually made January British gold 1.5625, and it broke through the 4 tael mark again, reaching 44 taels at noon. However, there was a cycle of one tael and several cents, so people's hearts were in a trance, resulting in the uncertain drifting of the market situation. By the close of the market at 43 taels and 7 mace, the announced price had been changed to 682 taels and 6 mace, because the daily gold hung a small 875, and the estimated reduction was 43 or 4 taels, and the noon close was 39 taels.</p>
<p>New Peak of 53 Taels and 8 Mace: The afternoon market opened at 44 taels and 8 mace (a gross profit of more than 4 taels), which was the remaining wind of the noon close. Then, Yongheng Yuanmao Yong pursued and bought, and because the Indian exchange rate went down by 5 Anna, it immediately rose to 49 taels. Xinfeng Zhifengyong sold and slightly retreated by one tael, estimated at 48 taels. Later, because Hengxing took the stage and scrambled to buy, the March British gold also rose, and the banks did 15 and a half against each other, and Shanghai sold 15 and a half in April. By 2:30, it had exceeded the 50 tael mark, estimated at 50 taels and 8 mace. After that, there was a mutual rise and fall of one tael. Around 2:45, the wind suddenly turned down, because Neixing Yuanheng Yuanmao Yong and others sold out one after another, and because the British gold did not show signs of tightening, and the March and April contracts still settled at 15 and a half, and the May contract at 155625, the price fell to 36 taels, 34 mace by 3:30. In an instant, it presented a peak again, and re-emerged above the 50 tael mark. The progress was all due to Hengxing Xieyu Dadecheng Yuanxingyong and others who bravely moved forward, and they had jumped up by 7 taels, showing a rushing and dancing image. At 4:15, the unprecedented miracle price was discovered, which was 53 taels and 8 mace. After that, there was a slight rise and fall of one or two taels. There seemed to be more sellers, and many parties sold out, so it became 51 taels, 56 mace. HSBC appeared first to order 15375, and Huabi Bank came out with 34375 in March. By the close of the market at 4:30, it was estimated to be 52 taels and 3 mace, which was about 18 or 9 taels higher compared to the day before (excluding 3 taels of swap). Checking the maximum price throughout the day, 53 taels and 8 mace, and the minimum price, 33 taels and a half, the difference was 20 taels and 3 mace, which was also huge. The goods opened at 38 taels and 2 mace in the morning, closed at 43 taels and a half at noon, 4 taels and 9 mace in the afternoon, and closed at 52 taels. The announced price was estimated to be reduced by 30 taels, and the exchange had both the front and rear markets and registered. In the morning, the January contract was 41 taels, and the February contract was 44 taels. In the afternoon, it was 49 taels to 52 taels. The water replenishment was 41 taels in the afternoon and 49 taels. The great changes in the sound of the swap were indeed unexpected.</p>
<p>Extremely Chaotic Trading in the Market: According to the trade statistics, Yongheng Yongfeng Yuanxing Yong Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yuanmao Yong, Hengxing Yuan, Bingxing and speculators were all buying, and the goods were also buying. Yuantai, Shunli, Wanxing, Dadecheng, and Zhifengyong were very active in and out. Chengfengyong, Tong Taichang, Yifengyong, Yuancheng Yong, and Xinfeng were all selling. In the afternoon, Yongheng, Hengxing, Shengda, Yuanxing Yong, Changshengyong, and Yongfeng were all buying. Zhifengyong's entries and exits were uneven. Yuanheng, Fuchang, Xinfeng, Wanxing, Shunli, and Tong Taichang were all selling. The Dalian gang sold a total of 2,500 gold bars, and bought 1,500 gold bars, still accounting for the short position. The Guangdong gang bought 2,000 gold bars to cover the short position.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Foreign Exchange: Apparently Easy, Secretly Tight <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver markets in England, America, and India all rose, but the spot market was still good. The United States was selling, but exchange rates were low. HSBC's listed prices also rose by half a block, with the British gold rate at 125, now one shilling five pence three seven five. The US dollar rate at 25, now thirty-five yuan one two five. The Indian rupee rate increased by half a yuan, now nine hundred seventy rupees five. The French franc rate increased by seven yuan, now eight hundred ninety-five yuan. The Sino-Japanese yen rate increased by seventy-five, now eighty-seven guilders two five. The German mark rate increased by one yuan two five, now one hundred forty-seven marks five. The Singapore dollar rate decreased by one tael two, now one hundred sixty taels. The Hong Kong dollar rate increased by five qian, now seventy-nine taels two five. The Japanese gold rate decreased by eight seven five, now one tael four qian one fen three seven five. However, the domestic market did not move accordingly, but instead showed a tendency to rise, no less than a divergence between the apparent and the real. In fact, the gold market has reached another peak, with the opening price of the morning market exceeding the 40 tael mark, and the afternoon market even exceeding 50 taels. New high prices continued to appear, probably due to large traders actively buying, and strange prices occurred in forward trading, making it unpredictable.

<p>The yarn market is trending upward. It is reported that the factory tax will be implemented on January 1, and there is also a compromise regarding the year-end closing issue. With these two factors, people's minds have become firm, and retail investors are buying long. The market atmosphere is tighter, but the current yarn business is still slow. Various gangs still have no development. According to Japanese merchants, the factory tax issue has little relationship with the yarn market, and the overseas cotton market is still fiercely declining, so the Chaozhou gang and Japanese merchants are calm. Some are continuing to add to their positions on rallies.</p>
<p>The Bids Are High by Two and a Half: The opening of the market was flat due to the continuous decline of American cotton. The market atmosphere suddenly tightened in the two or three discs, and the number of buyers suddenly increased. Due to the factory tax issue, each month rose by 7, 8, 9 qian to 1 tael 2 or 3 qian. The market atmosphere remained firm in the afternoon, and each month rose by another 4, 6, or 7 qian. However, the current yarn transaction was still slow.

<p>The cotton market suddenly rose sharply. The bulls tightened their hold on the current month, and the distant months were affected by it. Spot cotton transactions in the market completely stopped. The fire engine and Ningbo gangs were very strong in pulling, and they were unwilling to loosen their grip. The cotton market situation was unusually chaotic.</p>
<p>Han Standard Rose by More Than Three Qian: The opening of the exchange's Han Standard was flat due to the downward trend of American cotton.

<p>American Cotton Continued to Fall by More Than Ten Pounds: Yesterday, American cotton fell by 15 to 20 pounds in the futures market and 15 pounds in the spot market due to manufacturers buying futures and the Wall Street market being depressed.

Indian cotton initially fell slightly following American cotton, but later rebounded due to purchases by Japanese merchants.

<p>Zhongguan Japonica Slightly Increased by One Jiao... Baiyuan Slightly Softened</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the sources of various gangs arrived at No. 40, and the market sales were still good. The price of high-quality northern japonica rice did not fluctuate much, and it was still opened at 13 yuan 8 or 9 jiao. Zhongguan japonica rice was tight by one jiao, and the route was still active. The arrival and sales of thin indica rice were both sluggish, and the price was neither glorious nor disgraceful, with the top opening price being 11 yuan 9 jiao. Yangxian rice was very popular, and Duxian rice was stagnant and the price was stable. The buying momentum was less than the previous day. At the moment, the market price of Yangduxian rice has returned to consistency, and the top price is 12 yuan and a half. The market for Bubanxian rice was sluggish, and high-quality goods were opened at 12 yuan. The supply of premium goods continued to be scarce, and the special high-quality goods were opened at 13 yuan 2 or 3 jiao. The market situation was flat, and the price of Yinhua rice was slightly weak by half a chi.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, the sources arriving in Hexia were more than 20 houses. The sales on this street were quite good. The retail sales of northern japonica rice were extremely active, but high-quality goods were rare and sluggish, and the price was extremely firm. Sutong and other japonica rice shops continued to purchase Tongli's top-quality japonica rice, with the price opened at 11 yuan 8 or 9 jiao. The sales of southern thin indica rice and early indica rice were initially sluggish but later active. Transactions were very brisk in the afternoon, and the price was reported as flat. Yangduxian rice arrived sparsely and sales were stable, with no ups and downs in the market. The sales of Bianyinyuanjiu were sluggish, and the continued arrival of goods presented a mediocre trend.</p>

<p>Helped by Foreign Wheat and Gold Prices</p>
<p>After the opening of the vermicelli market yesterday morning and afternoon, the prices of various months showed a firm upward trend again. In the morning, the market sentiment for various months was much stronger than the previous day, with the quotation for foreign wheat returning to a good three or seven jiao. There were also many people making up for the floating vacancies. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the surface of the gold market was not only jumping wildly, but also 20 or more taels higher than the previous day. People with no fixed views were quite shocked, and the market price was invisibly attractive. The sharp decline at the moment seemed to be completely international. If the facts are taken as a prerequisite, it seems that the time is not right. As a result, this month rose by two fen compared to the previous day, the second month rose by two fen and seven li and a half, the third month rose by two fen and a half, and the fourth and fifth months rose by two fen and seven li and a half.</p>

<p>This Month Soared by One Qian and Three Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market sentiment for various months changed to a booming scene again. Initially, the market sentiment was slightly high due to the quotation of foreign wheat. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the momentum was even better due to the strong rise in the gold market. However, this month must be stopped for auction on the 20th, and the shorts, although silent, intend to wait quietly, but the bulls do not want to relax due to the relationship of interests, and there is still absorption in this month, which seems to have a short squeeze. Therefore, the market is rising step by step, and the trend is very serious. The distant period takes the recent period, so it also brings up a lot. This kind of progressive speculative buying and selling is not a blessing for formal operators. As a result, the closing price this month rose by a huge one qian and three fen compared to the previous day, January rose by eight fen, February rose by six fen, March and April rose by five fen, May rose by four fen, and current wheat remained unchanged by the manufacturers and no delivery was seen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the custom indica rice remained in a static position. Although there were no inquiries from the customer gang, the transaction intention of the street office was still strong. However, due to the squeeze of rice from Hexia, the market price did not increase due to its low arrival and good sales. Yesterday, the entire market was handled by the street office, with 100 bags of Jiangxi machine early rice at a price of 10 yuan and 4 jiao, more than 300 bags of Hunan machine oil rice at a price of 11 yuan and 2 jiao, and more than 400 bags of machine Jinggang rice at a price of 11 yuan 3 jiao 4 or 5 fen to 11 yuan and 2 jiao, 500 bags of Nanjing machine rice at a price of 10 yuan and 1 jiao half to 10 yuan. The arrival and inventory of Hunan machine Jing rice are still low, and the goods of newly arrived goods are better, so the market price is slightly higher than the one sold the previous day.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market of foreign firms in this port became increasingly deserted. Because the European and American markets have ample stocks of silk, neither futures nor spot silk has any appetite, and silk telegraphs do not turn around. Yesterday, only Huatong imported five packages of current Shanghai factory silk, and Samsung imported ten packages of Sichuan yellow factory silk. Xiangli imported six packages of coarse yellow silk, and the prices were all flat and weak.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the tea market of foreign firms in this port, the English firms Jinlong and Fushi continued to be interested in importing green tea such as needle eyebrows and show eyebrows from the incoming houses, and the transaction was not lonely. However, the market was extremely tired, and the selling price was still difficult to return to high. Zhenmei green tea from medium and low houses was slightly needed by Tianxiang Foreign Company. Xia Mu Pearl Tea also had sporadic sales, but the market price fell by another two or three taels. At this time when the year-end is approaching, Chinese tea merchants are eager to get rid of it, and the market price is even more difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<h3 id="e113">Superior Tribute Serge and Broadcloth Spot Goods Were Out of Stock <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of piece goods turned stable, and the actual sales were slightly stagnant. It is said that there is an extension of the settlement period for the Gregorian New Year, and the sale of substandard goods has also been stopped. However, Donghuo tribute neijie is increasingly rising, and superior goods are largely extinct. Santanyinyue, Sima Xiangru, Shile Bird, and Moganshan have no spot goods. Lieyan Muqiu has opened at three qian four and a half fen, Changbanqiao is three qian five fen, and Shuangtonglu is sold at three qian one fen. Sanyoutu is three qian zero two li and a half. Inferior goods have not changed much, Xiongyun Machang is two qian seven fen two li and a half, Zhu Hu and Circus are both two qian seven fen. Superior fine serge is also unusually attractive, and there is a state of being difficult to find. Baoqiu is sold out as soon as it arrives, and Gucheng will sell out at three qian four and a half fen. There are also no spot goods. Sijunzi Tu Yuan was sold out at three qian three fen. The street office has a strong need. The decline in Que Rong is still fierce. Yesterday, the Shansha gang slightly padded it, and the price was one qian eight fen to one qian seven and a half fen.

<h3 id="e117">Outcome of the Water Rate Case <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Taxpayers Association Holds Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>Water Rates Temporarily Paid According to Company Bills</p>
<p>Price Reduction to be Studied by Special Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession, regarding the water rate increase case, based on the report of the Chinese Directors of the Municipal Council, specially convened an emergency fourth general meeting at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. A record of the results is as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Yang Guoshu, Wu Yaqin, Xu Jiqing, Wen Lanting, Lu Fengzhu, Yu Zhongxian, Zhang Rulin, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Hanliang, Zhang Yilin, Lu Feibo Hong, Cao Zhigong, Sun Jingxi, Li Bohan, Sun Dipeng, Xu Tingzuo, Hu Fengxiang, Wu Zhihao, Xu Yunan, Chen Tianyin, Yan Esheng, Qian Longzhang, Wu Yunzhai, Yu Xiji, Zhao Jinqing, Hu Xi Wu, Wang Jie'an, Xie Zhongfu, Jiang Yinan, Wang Yansong, Yuan Jinchu, Hu Mengjia, Chu Huiseng, Lin Kanghou, Zhu Peiyuan, Zhang Heng Hai, Shen Tianxin, Zhang Zilian.  Present as Observers: Xu Xinliu, totaling thirty-nine people.</p>
<p>Report on the Process: Deputy Chairman Xu Jiqing presided, with Secretary Tao Leqin taking notes. After the customary formalities, the Chairman first reported on the process of urgently convening the representatives' meeting and invited the Chinese Directors to report on the discussions regarding the water rate case at the Municipal Council's special meeting yesterday (i.e., the day before). Director Yu Qiaqing reported, stating that in July, the water company proposed increasing the surcharge by one-quarter. The Municipal Council resolved and passed this matter at the first board meeting in August. At the time, Chinese Director Bei Huadong Songsun had resigned due to his impending departure abroad. Therefore, with only four Chinese Directors, despite their best efforts to argue against it, they were ultimately unable to reverse the decision due to a difference of one vote. Subsequently, following a request from the Real Estate Association, the Municipal Council's reconsideration on September 17th was also ineffective. Afterward, the examination of the water company's accounts revealed that the guaranteed interest rate was too high. Recently, the unfortunate incident of water shutoffs occurred. Therefore, they jointly requested the Municipal Council to convene a special meeting. During the meeting, arguments lasted for three hours. The result was that there was no way to change the 9% guaranteed interest rate, and since the price increase was already a fait accompli, suspension was difficult. Therefore, it was decided that the Public Utilities Committee would hire experts to jointly study the issue in order to reduce water prices and alleviate the burden on users. The prerequisite was to immediately restore the closed water pipes. Regarding the issue of paying water fees according to the company's bills, this Association will issue an announcement. This was the process of yesterday's Municipal Council meeting, etc. Next, Mr. Xu Xinliu provided a brief supplementary report. Subsequently, Lu Feibo Hong, Chu Huiseng, Yan Esheng, Hu Fengxiang, Wang Hanliang, Yu Xiji, Zhao Jinqing, Wu Zhihao, and others spoke and discussed measures to respond to the water rate case. He De Kui explained that if the water rate were increased by one-quarter for the three months from September to December of this year, the company's income would increase by 216,616 taels. For the entire next year, it is estimated to increase by 605,000 taels, for a total income of 2,780,000 taels. Furthermore, after auditing the accounts, it was found that the company was actually wasteful in many areas. Therefore, the Municipal Council could, according to Article 23 of the contract, review the company's accounts and supervise its expenditures at any time. Therefore, the Municipal Council's special board meeting resolved that the Public Utilities Committee should hire experts to form a special committee, which is a feasible fact, etc.</p>
<p>Meeting Results: It was resolved that: (1) Continuing the water supply and not shutting off the water again are prerequisites. (2) During the working period of the special committee composed of experts hired by the Municipal Council's Public Utilities Committee, water rates will temporarily be paid according to the company's bills. If the special committee believes that the price should not be increased in the future, the overpaid amount must still be deducted. (3) The working period of the special committee shall not exceed the end of December of the 20th year at the latest. (4) This resolution will be published in the newspaper to notify all users. Yan Esheng and Tao Leqin immediately drafted it on the spot, and it was passed on the spot. The meeting adjourned at 6 p.m. The announcement passed by the representatives' meeting is also recorded below.</p>
<p>General Assembly Notice: Regarding the announcement, this case concerns the British Shanghai Waterworks' 25.1% water rate increase. A public announcement denying it has already been issued. The company unexpectedly did not seek a legal solution and took the action of shutting off the water. All users were not subdued. Even those who paid did so under duress. This is what this Association should express admiration for. Now the Municipal Council has accommodated the opinions of our attending directors and specially convened a special meeting on December 15th, taking the price increase as a fait accompli. However, the company's internal affairs should be fundamentally studied and improved, resolving that: (1) Continuing the water supply and not shutting off the water again are prerequisites. (2) The Municipal Council's Public Utilities Committee and newly hired experts will jointly form a special committee to thoroughly study methods to reduce the company's water rates, etc. This Association convened a representatives' meeting on the 16th of this month, thoroughly discussed it, and resolved that since the Municipal Council has organized a special committee to thoroughly investigate and study various issues of the water company to determine how water prices can be reduced, during the working period of this special committee, water fees should temporarily be paid according to the company's bills. When the special committee's investigation and research results are available in the future, if it is believed that the price should not be increased, the overpaid water price will still be deducted. The period for temporarily paying according to the company's bills, that is, the working period of the special committee, shall not exceed the end of December of the 20th year at the latest, etc. This special announcement is for your information.</p>

<p>Next Year</p>
<h3 id="e120">Implementation of New Tariff <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Highest Tax Increase on Tobacco</p>
<p>Japan and the United States Rush to Ship Goods</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance will implement a new tariff next year. The entire tariff rate has not yet been announced, but according to reliable sources, the content will include the largest increase in tobacco tax. The tariff on cigarettes and cigars, originally 40%, will now be increased to 75.5%. The next highest will be jewelry and various luxury goods, such as face powder and perfume, which will be increased to 40%. The new tariff on food will be 30%, while canned food will be 20%. Paper tax and sugar tax will increase by 2.5%. The new tax on machinery will vary, with the highest being 25%. The new tariff rate on other imported goods has not yet been heard of. It is also heard that although the US government's implementation of the new tariff on China will have some impact on its trade with China, its attitude is that it does not object as long as it treats all countries equally. However, businessmen from various countries believe that it is closely related to their import and export trade. In order to avoid paying huge taxes, they are mostly rushing to load huge amounts of goods to arrive in China within the year, which is of recordable value. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Large Quantities of American Tobacco Arrive: Among the imported goods in the new tariff, if foreign tobacco is imported, the tax amount must be greater than the original amount. American tobacco leaves have been purchased the most by various factories in China. Since receiving the news last month that the new tariff rate will be announced on New Year's Day, Shanghai has telegraphed the United States to ship large quantities of tobacco leaves to Shanghai in advance. The first batch of goods rushed to be shipped, worth 600,000 yuan, was imported yesterday, and the rest are also on the way. Most of them are loaded on various ships such as Tianxiang, Prince, and Old Taigu, all departing from New York, and must arrive in Shanghai within 37 days. Most of them can arrive before December 31st. It is said that this batch of tobacco leaves is worth 5-6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Rushed and Crowded: Because China is implementing new tariffs, various Japanese merchants in Shanghai telegraphed Yokohama and Hanshin to ship the goods they ordered to Shanghai before New Year's Day in order to avoid paying the new tariffs. In recent days, after consulting with the Japanese postal company to arrange for ships to transport them, Shanghai has 12-130,000 bags of Japanese sugar and 340,000 pieces of finished goods. There are also more than 100,000 pieces of Japanese sugar and tens of thousands of pieces of yarn and cloth to Hankou and Beiyang. The Japanese postal company in Shanghai has increased the number of ships dispatched from the first batch imported today, including Tai'an Maru, Tiancheng No. 9, Bi Jun Maru, and Tsukuba Maru, together with the original Mikasa, Kasagi, Maya, and Aso, for a total of eleven ships, all loaded within 14 days. Fearing that the capacity of the eleven ships would not be enough, three large ships from the Pacific and European lines were also assigned to transport these tax-avoiding goods to Shanghai. In the Yangtze River and Beiyang, 17 ships were dispatched by the Near Seas Company to transport them on behalf. In total, in these two weeks, there are more than 30 Japanese ships specially carrying these goods to China, totaling 300,000 pieces, with an average value of 4-5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Wenzhou Tax Tide Temporarily Set: The Yongjia Unified Donation Bureau changed the tax on foreign and Guangdong goods to a unified donation, with a tax increase of more than ten times, which aroused the resistance of merchants and gangs. Later, the County Party Department took the responsibility of mediation and telegraphed the ministry to ask for instructions on the method. This matter has been recorded in this newspaper. Now it is known that the Ministry of Finance has issued an approval order to Wenzhou on this case. The general idea is to implement the reduction of taxes and the increase of taxes from New Year's Day, and there will be changes to the current tax rules. The collection of unified donations for foreign and Guangdong goods in Wenzhou is determined by the ministry order, but since the gang has exhausted its difficulties, it is allowed to handle the changes. The foreign and Guangdong goods there will still be collected according to the original tax amount, but the name must be changed to a unified donation, so that the maintenance of the ministry order is maintained while the hardships of the merchants are actually understood. The merchants and gangs are very satisfied with this. Shanghai-Wenzhou foreign and Guangdong goods are now being loaded as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Soliciting Coins from Various Countries <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Czech Coin Association Willing to Respond</p>
<p>Central Mint Not Yet Organized</p>
<p>The Central Mint once had a saying of soliciting coins from various countries. The Czech representative specially sent a letter to the External Affairs Office, stating, "I have received a letter from the Coin Association of my country, saying that if your country's mint collects coins from other countries, the association is willing to send them to join in," and requested that the office check and reply. The office then sent a letter to the mint to inquire. Yesterday, it sent a reply to the Czech representative, stating, "Regarding the matter of soliciting coins, it has been forwarded to the Central Mint for checking. Now, the mint has replied, 'Our factory must solicit coins from various countries, but since the date of commencement has not been determined, the solicitation of coins has not been organized yet.' I hope you will convey this information, etc." The corresponding letter is a reply to hope you will check for information.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson</p>
<h3 id="e122">Final Statement from Seamen <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Company Refuses to Increase Salary</p>
<p>Branch Releases Declaration</p>
<p>The three departments of stewards, firemen and seamen serving on foreign merchant ships requested six foreign shipping companies to follow the example of Chinese ships and increase wages by six yuan per person per month. Only Taikoo Company, mediated by Yu Qiaqing, signed a wage increase contract in late November. This matter has been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. However, the British Jardine Matheson did not respond to the seamen's request, which has aroused the public anger of all the seamen of Jianghai. They are prepared to take final measures against the company and carry out a strike to promote the company's awareness. The reporter went to various parties to investigate the ins and outs of the matter in detail and recorded their declarations, etc., as follows:</p>
<p>Seamen's Request Process: After Taikoo agreed to increase the monthly salary of seamen on various ships by five yuan, the seamen on various Jardine Matheson ships believed that the matter was the same, and Jardine Matheson had previously declared that if Taikoo increased salaries, the company would also increase them accordingly. Unexpectedly, after Taikoo signed the contract, Jardine Matheson made no statement. The seamen sent representatives to inquire, and the company initially made excuses that the shipping industry was sluggish this year and requested a postponement. When the seamen repeatedly sent letters urging them, the company ignored them. Later, representatives from the union went to inquire, but the company did not respond sincerely and delayed until now. Another month has passed, and there has been no result. The seamen could no longer bear it and publicly agreed to deal with the company with final and decisive measures.</p>
<p>Petitioning for Central Assistance: Jardine Matheson has about 30 ships sailing on the Yangtze River and the Northern Seas, with more than 1,000 seamen. They are very angry about the failure to request a salary increase. Recently, the foreigners of the company have even used oppressive measures to force seamen on each ship to state that they do not want a salary increase in order to suppress the salary increase movement. The seamen have held many meetings and decided to take final steps. Therefore, the seamen's branch was requested to, based on the requests of the seamen, fully state the impact of rising living standards and the pain of oppression by imperialists, and to describe in detail the process of requesting a salary increase from Jardine Matheson and the company's conspiracy to sabotage the labor movement and refuse to increase salaries, and to request assistance from the Central Government. Now, in order to maintain their own livelihoods, the seamen have to make further statements. If there is no satisfactory reply, the seamen have to go on strike to promote the awakening of the capitalists. This petition was forwarded by the branch on behalf of the seamen's general union to the Central Government. When the Central Government's approval order arrives in Shanghai, the seamen will go on strike. It is heard that the petition can be sent out today.</p>
<p>Declaration Released Yesterday: The seamen's branch specially issued a declaration on this case, requesting assistance from all circles. The declaration is recorded as follows: "Material civilization and the daily decline of life are recognized by all countries. At this time, those who suffer the most are workers. The economic difficulties of workers have reached an extreme point. The trend is like this and cannot be stopped. Therefore, workers in various industries have asked capitalists to increase their salaries to help them make ends meet."</p>
<p>"There are countless examples. Our seamen work in the waves and serve on long journeys. They have no fixed rest and no fixed working hours. They are more arduous than other workers, but their salaries are still the same as they were more than ten years ago. In the past ten years, production has increased day by day, and prices have increased even more. In proportion, it has exceeded more than ten times. If calculated according to the salary earned, how can it be enough to support a family and sustain life? Workers on various ships have repeatedly stated their hardships and requested to negotiate a salary increase. Looking back on the past and present, the situation is true and reasonable. This association, in view of the fact that the passenger, cargo, and water feet of various companies have increased several times, while the wages of workers are still the same as before, believes that the thickness is inherently uneven and the reasons are insufficient. Therefore, it reported to the general union, dispatched personnel to cooperate, and consulted with various shipping companies. Mr. Yu Qiaqing generously supported the result. Taikoo (added four yuan from September 1st of this year, because the company had already automatically added it), China Merchants, and various Chinese shipping companies (added four yuan from August 1st of this year, and another two yuan from March 1st of the 20th year) signed contracts and added them one after another. However, Jardine Matheson has no sincerity at all. It compromises with the workers on the surface, but oppresses them in every possible way in secret, forcing the workers to say that they do not want a salary increase. At this time, how can any worker not want a salary increase? How can there be such a reason in the world? During the May 30th strike, the company arbitrarily fired workers. Those who were willing to stay generally reduced their wages. At that time, workers had to endure it for the sake of survival. It has been several years now. The company's conspiracy is clearly revealed, and it is so inhumane. This association is a seamen's group, and it was founded by the Premier himself. It bears a heavy responsibility and its duties are closely related. It should adhere to the Premier's legacy and, in addition to peace, only struggle.

<p>Xiong's Condition: He slept soundly for six hours on the night of the 15th. After waking up on the morning of the 16th, his spirits were excellent and his body felt quite comfortable. At 9:30 a.m., Dean Niu Huisheng again used X-rays to examine the fractured bone, and the connection was very good. He could urinate and defecate on his own. His diet included chicken porridge, soybean curd, vegetable soup, and juice. His temperature was 99.2 degrees, his pulse was 86, and his respiration was 20. Caring About Bandit Suppression: Xiong's secretary, Li Dezhao, went to Gan Province before Xiong to arrange everything. After hearing the news in Jiujiang that Commander Xiong was injured, he immediately went to see Chairman Jiang and reported everything. He returned to Shanghai by train from Beijing the night before and went to the orthopedic hospital yesterday morning to visit Commander Xiong and report on the bandit suppression situation in Gan Province. Commander Xiong inquired in great detail. Hearing that the government troops were arriving and the bandits were scattering, Xiong looked quite pleased. Yesterday, Central Committee member Chu Minyi, Zhang Qun, Lin Zhiyuan from the Fujian Provincial Committee, Xiao Shu, Zhu Shiming, Zhou Yongneng, and others all went to the hospital to express their condolences to Xiong.</p>
<p>Yang's Condition: Yang's cough has not stopped, but the blood in his sputum has gone. His joints still hurt, but he can sit up with light support. He slept very peacefully before 2:00 a.m. From 2:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m., his cough worsened, but after 4:00 a.m. he was better again. The doctor prescribed cough medicine. His daily food intake has increased again. His temperature is 37.3 degrees Celsius and his pulse is 84.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun's Condolences: Yesterday, those who went to Baolong Hospital to express their condolences included Central Committee member Wu Tiecheng, Chen Guofu's representative Chen Xizeng, and Mayor Zhang. Mayor Zhang talked with Yang for a long time. Because Yang had not had an X-ray before, the extent of internal injuries was unknown, and there was concern about brain congestion and pleurisy. Now, after a Parker examination, it has been proven that there is no danger. After Yang explained this to Zhang, Zhang asked him to rest and recuperate peacefully.</p>
<h3 id="e124">This City Will Implement Standardized Weights and Measures on Schedule <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Instructed the Bureau of Social Affairs to Comply</p>
<p>The Municipal Government, in order to implement standardized weights and measures on schedule, instructed the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday: "In order to comply with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Industrial Character No. 4043, the Ministry presented to the government last year to convene representatives from various central ministries, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and domestic experts to organize a Committee for the Promotion of Standardized Weights and Measures to formulate a unified national weights and measures procedure, stipulating that the sixteen provinces along the Yangtze River and the coast with convenient transportation, industrial and commercial economic development, as well as the capital, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Qingdao, and Guangzhou, should complete standardization by the end of the 20th year of the Republic of China. The ten provinces of Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Xiamen should complete standardization by the end of the 21st year of the Republic of China. Tibet, Qinghai, and Xikang should complete standardization by the end of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. This procedure has already been submitted to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for approval and filing, and has been distributed to the provincial and municipal governments for reference. Cases are on file. Currently, fourteen provinces and six cities have formulated procedures for standardized weights and measures and submitted them to the Ministry for verification and filing. Several other provinces have also submitted them and are being reviewed. In addition, due to frequent military uprisings, there has been no time to take care of standardization matters. Except for a few provinces and cities that can handle the case as is, many of those that have already handled it have also been restricted by military affairs and cannot actively proceed. Fortunately, the military suppression has been pacified and the overall situation has been settled, so the work should be stepped up in a timely manner to lay the foundation for the reorganization of national administration. For this reason, the Ministry specially held a National Weights and Measures Conference in November of this year to consult with various central agencies and provincial and municipal governments to select representatives, and to invite experts in the study of weights and measures to gather together to jointly discuss the new system promotion methods in the future. The Ministry, based on the national weights and measures unification procedures, drafted a plan requesting that the provincial and municipal governments unify on schedule, and submitted a proposal for discussion (this is the Ministry's first proposal for this conference), which is divided into four sections: First, training and testing personnel; second, establishing testing offices to implement administrative affairs; third, promoting manufacturing; and fourth, completing testing and inspection work. Each section is further divided into detailed items for explanation. After discussion and resolution by the conference, it was approved to be submitted for filing and distributed to the provincial and municipal governments for reference. Check the original case of the four sections listed, which are the key tasks for promoting the new system today, and should be organized without delay. However, the situations in the provinces and cities are inconsistent, so the steps taken in handling them are also very different. Now, the four sections of the original case are presented for printing, in addition to being submitted for filing, and distributed to the relevant departments, and a copy is enclosed, hoping that you will check the various regulations and methods of the national weights and measures unification procedure, and check which of the items listed in each section have been handled and which have not, determine the implementation plan, and proceed quickly so that it can be unified as scheduled, and submit the proposed plan to the Ministry for verification, which is truly beneficial to the public. etc. With this approval, the original method is copied and sent to the bureau, and you are required to comply with it and instruct it to be handled accordingly. This order."</p>

<p>Farmers Gave Souvenirs Publicly</p>
<p>The Yangsi Cotton Crop Experiment Farm of the National Central University College of Agriculture is located in Yangsi District, Pudong, this city. Since its establishment, it has been more than ten years. In addition to focusing on Jiangyin white seed cotton breeding and cultivation method experiments, it also carries out promotion work. In recent years, it has made considerable achievements. Local cotton farmers are very enthusiastic about receiving cotton seeds from the farm and inquiring about cultivation methods. In order to carefully carry out the business, the farm has temporarily limited the promotion area to nearby villages and has not been able to popularize it elsewhere. This year, Chen Zixin, the Yangsi District City Committee, specially approved the Social Bureau for the purpose of improving and promoting cotton planting in the district, and donated funds to create ten cotton planting cooperative experiment farms in the district to serve as a demonstration and to promote the promotion. The cotton seeds used in all cooperative places and the technical guidance are all the responsibility of the farm. Now that the harvest season is over, Ma Shusheng District is the best, with an average yield of 162 catties per mu. The average yield of other districts is also more than 120 catties per mu, which is 20% more than that of farmers who use ordinary seeds and cultivate them in the old way. The farmers in each district are grateful for the quality of the farm's cotton seeds and the enthusiastic guidance of the promoters. They specially gave a silver district with the words "Agricultural Tutor" written on it to commemorate the occasion. Chen Zixin, the city committee member of the district, also compensated 120 yuan because the promoters of the farm provided voluntary guidance, ran around the fields in the hot summer, and obtained a bumper harvest. It is heard that the promoters of the farm took the guidance work as their duty and could not accept it without authorization. They asked the Dean of the College and instructed that the farm should be used in the name of the farm for cotton promotion in the district.</p>

<p>The Divorce Case Has Just Ended</p>
<p>A Lawsuit Has Arisen Between the Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law</p>
<p>The Female Lawyer Vigorously Mediates</p>
<p>Ye Paid a Huge Sum of Money to Have His Daughter-in-Law Separate</p>
<p>Gu Yaojuan, the daughter-in-law of Ye Ziheng, previously filed a lawsuit in the Civil Tribunal of the Special District Local Court, requesting to divorce her husband, Ye Kangnan. It has been peacefully settled through the mediation of relatives and friends. Recently, Ms. Gu hired a lawyer to sue her mother-in-law, Ye Zhang, in the Criminal Tribunal of the Special Court for embezzlement, etc. The reasons for her lawsuit are roughly as follows: "The plaintiff is the defendant's daughter-in-law, and all the wedding gifts and jewelry are managed by the plaintiff. However, the defendant, citing the unrest in the situation, instructed her to hand them over for safekeeping on her behalf. The plaintiff believed her to be true and handed them over completely. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff filed a divorce lawsuit this time, and then a settlement was reached. According to the terms of the settlement, all the wedding gifts and jewelry should be returned to the plaintiff. However, the defendant refused to hand them over, resulting in the return of only nine pieces of wedding gifts and jewelry. Among these nine pieces, five pieces were purchased temporarily from Yang Qinghe Silver Building on Nanjing Road and were not the original items, and the materials were very different from the original materials. The defendant initially claimed that the situation was unstable and asked the plaintiff to hand over the jewelry to her, and this time she hid the original items and temporarily purchased jewelry with very different materials, hoping to deceive her. The defendant used fraudulent means to implement embezzlement, which is very obvious and constitutes the crime of Article 363 and 356 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, please arrest her for questioning. However, the defendant is extremely cunning and may flee at any time. Please issue an arrest warrant as soon as possible. If the accusation is false, she is willing to sit in the crime of false accusation, etc." The court approved the words and signed an summons, ordering the arrest to be summoned to 105 Tongyi Lane, Jing'an Temple Road. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Cheng Shangfeng came to the court to open the trial. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant turned themselves in. According to the complaint of the Chinese police, they were ordered to summon them with a court summons, but there was no number 105 on Tongyi Lane, so there was no way to deliver the summons, etc. The lawyer representing the plaintiff also rose to state the case and requested that the account books of Yang Qinghe Silver Building be checked so that it could be clarified. After verification by Judge Cheng, he instructed that the summons be reissued at a later date. It is also heard that this case has been mediated by a famous female lawyer and there is hope of a settlement. The condition is that the father, Ye Ziheng, paid a huge sum of money to have his daughter-in-law separate first. Yesterday, 100,000 yuan was handed over to a lawyer to have his daughter-in-law separate first, and it is expected to be resolved in a few days.</p>
<p>In the Safe</p>
<h3 id="e143">Embezzlement Case of 20,000 Yuan <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Rong Xilin and Wang Jingqing Accused</p>
<p>Newly Installed Safe Unreliable</p>
<p>Rong Xilin of Rong Xiji Cotton Firm at 409 Zhoujin Lane, Hankou Road, from Wuxi, and his employed partner Wang Jingqing, are accused of stealing 20,000 silver dollars deposited by Zhu Jingan, the Shanghai-based manager of the Litai Textile Factory of Taicang, from Anhui province. Following Zhu’s accusation, the Special District Local Court, under Judge Ge, held a trial yesterday. According to the plaintiff, Rong had a contract with Litai to handle cotton transactions. Last month, the factory sent an employee, Gu Baotang, to Shanghai with 20,000 yuan in cash to purchase cotton locally. Rong Xilin invited Gu to stay at his firm and persuaded him to deposit the cash with him for safekeeping. However, on the second night, the defendant allegedly instructed his partner Wang Jingqing to secretly open the safe and steal the money. Gu Baotang testified that on the 17th of last month, he and his colleague Cao Sanduo came to Shanghai with 20,000 silver dollars to buy cotton in Datuantuan. They met the defendant, who invited them to stay at his firm, claiming that he had a newly installed safe suitable for storing money, ensuring that even if something went wrong, the funds would be safe. He even offered to entrust the keys to Gu. Lured by these sweet words, Gu placed all the money in the safe. At the time, Wang Sanduo, Wang Jingqing, Chen Yuntang, and others were present. That evening, Wang Jingqing invited them to see a movie and have dinner, but Gu declined. However, Wang insisted on taking him to the nearby Rixin Garden for a bath. While Gu was bathing, Wang excused himself and never returned. Upon returning to the defendant’s firm, Gu found that the safe was unlocked. Opening it, he discovered that all the silver dollars were gone, and Wang had also disappeared. Gu believed that there must have been two identical keys, one given to him for safekeeping, and the other remaining in the hands of the defendants, leaving no doubt about their guilt. Rong Xilin, the defendant, testified that Wang Jingqing was not his employed partner but was merely staying at his firm temporarily because he was unemployed. Gu Baotang had known Wang for a long time, and Gu voluntarily brought the money to be stored, having nothing to do with Rong. Judge Ge ordered Rong Xilin to post 20,000 yuan bail or a shop guarantee; lacking bail, Rong was detained and the hearing was adjourned.</p>

<p>Li’s Wife Requests Coffin for Corpse</p>
<p>Official Orders Arrest of Culprit</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the male corpse found in cow dung on Jiaotong Road, Tanzi Bay, details were previously reported. Yesterday afternoon, Li Pan, the wife of the deceased, along with local security officer Liu Sansan, submitted a petition to the Local Court, stating that the deceased was her husband, Li Changqing, 25 years old, from Yancheng. He resided at 104 Daxi Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and worked as a driver for the Public Concession Tram Company. On the evening of the 11th of this month, a friend named Zhang Er invited him out to collect dues. However, on the afternoon of the 13th, his body was discovered in cow dung, covered in knife wounds. The discovery of the body was unknown until Li Hesan, the husband’s cousin, saw the body while working as a rickshaw puller. Upon learning the news, he went to the Tanzi Bay police station to inquire and was instructed to file a case with the local security officer, requesting justice and a coffin for the corpse, and asking for an investigation into those suspected. The prosecutor held a preliminary hearing for a long time and ordered a written guarantee, instructing the local security officer to accompany them to collect the coffin for burial and to investigate and arrest the culprit.</p>

<p>San Francisco Bank Executive Manager</p>
<p>Comes to Shanghai to Serve at Shanghai Bank</p>
<p>Wells Fargo Bank of San Francisco, recognizing the significant progress of the Chinese banking sector in recent years and its rising momentum, has reached an agreement with Chen Guangfu, General Manager of the Shanghai Bank, to send its Executive Manager, Mr. Wallis, to Shanghai to work as an employee of the Shanghai Bank, aiming to exchange knowledge and experience with the Chinese banking sector. Mr. Wallis has already arrived in Shanghai to fulfill his service of exchanging knowledge. While there are often examples of universities exchanging professors between countries (such as teachers from University A and University B agreeing to exchange positions for one or two years) to achieve an even progress in knowledge and experience, this is an unprecedented first in the banking sector. Wells Fargo Bank and Shanghai Bank have uniquely initiated this practice, which can be seen as a precursor to cooperation between Chinese and foreign banks. It is reported that the Shanghai Bank has not yet designated personnel to serve at Wells Fargo Bank, but outstanding bank staff will soon be selected and sent to the United States to implement the exchange of knowledge and experience.</p>

<p>Three Crew Members Drown</p>
<p>At 5:40 PM on the day before yesterday, a Jinbaoli freighter carrying yellow sand and gravel was entering Wusong from the Yangtze River estuary. While navigating through Zhanghuabang, a Yongmao fishing boat from the Nanshi Yongsheng Fishing Company suddenly sped towards it. Despite the freighter crew’s desperate attempts to steer clear, the Yongmao boat seemed to ignore them completely, not even sounding its horn, and rammed straight into the freighter. The freighter immediately capsized, and all eight crew members fell into the water. Hearing the loud cries for help, the Yongmao boat finally stopped its engine. Simultaneously, rescue boats from the Rescue Bureau and customs boats from the Wusong branch office rushed to the scene and began the rescue efforts. Five crew members were rescued, but the other three could not be reached, and their bodies were nowhere to be found. The drowned were identified as Wang Along, 31 years old, from Dinghai; Guan Atu, 25 years old, from Ningbo; and Hong Afa, 23 years old, from Dinghai. Following the accident, the Jianghai Customs investigated the vessel at fault to prepare a report. Upon hearing this tragic news, the families of the deceased wept and wailed, a truly heartbreaking scene. Shao Xubai and Wang Azeng, the owners of the freighter, have separately petitioned the Jianghai Customs Superintendent and the Wusong District Water Patrol of the Public Security Bureau, requesting that Yongsheng Company be held responsible for compensating the loss of the ship and cargo, and for providing generous compensation to the families of the deceased crew members.

While passing the waters off Lujiazui Water Patrol station on the Pudong side, a Huidefeng Company tugboat sped from the north and, due to careless navigation, crashed head-on into the cotton boat. The cotton boat capsized, losing four or five bales of cotton, and all the boat's equipment was lost. The four crew members fell into the river but were rescued by a boat behind them. After the accident, Feng Renjie, the manager of the firm, inspected the scene and reported the loss to the Water Patrol, requesting compensation.</p>

<p>Since its establishment as the first manufacturer of high-quality fountain pens in China, the Great China Tap Water Pen Factory has been in operation for two years. Recognizing the growing development of Chinese culture and the increasing demand, the factory hosted a banquet at the Dadong Restaurant last night to gather opinions from all sectors and improve its products. Attendees included Ge Gongzhen, Qian Cangshuo, Zhang Zilian, Ren Jinpin, Liu Shangmu, and dozens of others. During the banquet, Mr. Yin Lushen, the factory owner, reported on the factory's progress. Mo Keming, a representative of the Overseas Chinese Industrial Investigation Delegation, spoke next, stating that promoting industrial production is the only way to save the country. Because of the backwardness of our country’s industrial production, we still rely on foreigners for food and clothing. According to a recent survey, more than 600 million taels of silver are sent abroad each year for these two items. If something were to happen between China and foreign countries, they would stop supplying us with food and clothing before even attacking us, and some of us would starve immediately. Therefore, we must realize this early, rise up, and strive for industrial revolution. Zhang Zilian of the National Products Joint Market then spoke, stating that the first responsibility of a person in society is to fulfill their human duties, regardless of hardship and difficulty. If we can fulfill our human duties, success is not something to be overly happy about, and failure is not something to be ashamed of. For example, promoting national products is something that Chinese people should do, but some people are secretly jealous and destructive, showing that there are not many people in society who can truly be called human beings. Mr. Zhang's speech was poignant, and everyone in attendance was moved. The guests and hosts parted on good terms at around 9:00 PM.</p>

<p>Director Yuan of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, recognizing the rampant gambling of flower gambling among citizens, despite repeated prohibitions, continues to be openly defied, causing great harm to the area. He issued a notice to all district offices last month, instructing them to pay close attention and giving patrol officers the temporary right to inspect pedestrians. Anyone found with flower gambling documents or evidence should be immediately arrested, pre-trialed, and then handed over to the bureau for punishment, without unauthorized disposition. Therefore, in recent days, the number of flower gambling cases detained in various district offices and transferred to the head office has decreased compared to last month. According to a staff member of the head office yesterday, if strict enforcement continues, it is expected that flower gambling in the Chinese Concession will come to an end in two months.</p>
<p>Russian Dancer</p>
<h3 id="e157">Fiance Injures Foot, Case Awaits Sentencing <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The case of Russian woman Asia Tolo, 19 years old, being shot in the foot by her lover, Peter Lich, in a house at 104 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession last month has been previously reported. Now that the plaintiff has recovered, the police sent the defendant to the French Court for further investigation. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that it was unknown whether the shooting was caused by emotional turmoil or intentional harm. The lawyer found it incomprehensible that the plaintiff was only 19 years old, while the defendant was over 40, engaging in gambling at the General Assembly and seducing women, acting as a gigolo. The plaintiff was seduced by the defendant in Harbin when she was only 17 years old, under the pretext of no wife and considerable wealth, leading to her loss of virginity. Later, she found out that the defendant had a wife and several children, and when she confronted him, the defendant claimed to have divorced his wife. They then came to Shanghai together, living together as if they were married. The plaintiff behaved properly, but the defendant often went out and did not return, and had affairs. When she advised him, she was insulted and scolded. This spring, the defendant went to Hong Kong for several months, and upon returning to Shanghai, he abused the plaintiff even more, leading to their separation. The plaintiff had to work as a dancer at a dance hall to make a living. When the defendant found out, he often caused trouble at the dance hall, and finally shot and injured the plaintiff's foot, trying to prevent her from working as a dancer and cutting off her livelihood. According to a Western doctor, the plaintiff's leg has been permanently disabled, and the lawyer requested severe punishment and compensation of 10,000 yuan. The defendant, Peter Lich, also hired a lawyer to defend him, stating that he shot the plaintiff's leg due to mental stimulation and not intentional harm. He stated that the plaintiff seduced him first, and because of her affection, he abandoned his wife and children to come to Shanghai with her. On the day of the incident, both parties went to a tailor shop to order clothes and then went out. The plaintiff insisted on going to a Russian man named Feiteloff, but the defendant believed that this man was his enemy and tried to stop her in vain. The defendant was angry and fired a shot at the ground, intending to scare her, but unfortunately, the bullet bounced off the ground and injured the plaintiff's foot. The defendant used to serve the country on the battlefield, which caused his irritable nature. He was very remorseful afterwards and had no malicious intent, requesting leniency. As for the private prosecution, the plaintiff's injury was minor and there was no significant loss, requesting dismissal. The Chinese and Western officials concluded the debate and will await sentencing.</p>

For unknown reasons, he committed suicide by swallowing poison. Yesterday morning, the tea boy found him lying in bed and knocked on the door without response. He pried the door open and found him stiff in bed, dead. He had not taken off his clothes. The tea boy reported to the police, who sent detectives to investigate. The corpse was wearing a dark blue serge robe lined with yellow flannel, with a sanitary shirt and undershirt underneath, serge trousers, foot wraps, a melon-skin cap, gray socks, and foreign-style shoes. The face had smallpox marks. The corpse was taken to the Tongren Foyuan Hall for examination and will await a post-mortem examination.</p>

<p>Compensation of 200 Yuan Awarded</p>
<p>At 3:20 PM the day before yesterday, Ma Jiquan was driving car number 10427 north on Dixiwei Road in Hongkou. At that time, a child named Gao Changnian was also on the road, walking west and then east. Ma Jiquan lost control and accidentally hit the child. He immediately got out of the car, helped the child into the car, and took him to the hospital for treatment. The child died at 10:00 PM the night before last. Upon receiving the report, the Harbin Police Station ordered detectives to investigate and took the child's body to the Faelun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Xu Mei, a prosecutor from the Special District Local Court, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. He sat in the official seat and heard the complaint from the child's father, Gao Changlin, that his son was only nine years old and died tragically while out shopping, and he demanded compensation. Ma Jiquan also filed a complaint, stating that he did not drive the car for luxury or pride, but for official duties. Moreover, the child was largely at fault, and he could only offer 40 yuan in compensation, which the father considered too little, and requested an increase. Mr. Xu reviewed the evidence and ruled that Gao Changnian was indeed injured and killed by the car, and ordered Ma to pay the family 200 yuan. The body was handed over to his father for burial.</p>

He reported to the Water Patrol Police Station, officer number 35, who took him to the police station. After changing into dry clothes, the young man identified himself as Gong Xianglang, 25 years old, from Chongming, a pai-gow craftsman working at his senior apprentice Chen Xilang's shop at 22 Jiangzhuang Street in the Chinese Concession. He said that he committed suicide because he was angry after being severely reprimanded by his senior apprentice for improper behavior. The police chief verified the information and sent officer Huang Songsheng to take Gong back to his family at 9:00 AM to prevent him from repeating the attempt.</p>

Due to the dry weather, the grinding wheel suddenly exploded, injuring Yin Kaishan's head, breaking his skull, and killing him instantly. Yang Renji was also injured in the head, bleeding profusely. The factory's Western supervisor reported the incident to the Tilanqiao Police Station, who dispatched officer number 222 to send the injured and the corpse to Tongren Hospital. After the doctor treated Yang's wounds, he was discharged. The corpse was transferred from the hospital to the morgue for examination.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provisional Charity Relief Association recently received a plea for relief from the Huaiyin Relief Association, stating that the county is an important town in northern Jiangsu. Due to the country's troubles, the suppression troops were few, and bandits rose from all directions, gathering into large groups, devastating the entire territory. Villages and towns were turned into ruins, countless people were captured, property was looted, and thousands of houses were burned, affecting tens of thousands of people. Faced with the chilling north wind, sleeping in the open and exposed to the elements, and crying out for food, the disaster is the worst in decades.

<p>Western Dye Industry: The Western Dye Industry Association sent a letter yesterday to the representatives Li Shiyan, Wang Zuolin, Shen Yaoshan, and Zhang Zhenhou of the consolidated industry regarding Guanghua Dye Company's excuse for delaying membership due to its concurrent engagement in dyeing and weaving, stating: "Dear Sirs, Regarding the Guanghua Dye Company's case of delaying membership due to its concurrent engagement in the dyeing and weaving industry, we have received a letter from the factory stating that it has decided to withdraw. Our association has already sent a reply, which briefly states: 'We have received your letter stating that our dye business has been declining in recent years, and we have decided to specialize in dyeing and weaving and have joined the Machine-Made National Products Association, and we are withdrawing from your association. Upon investigation, your company was already listed as a Western dye industry member before the Shanghai Foreign Goods Nine Industries Association, affiliated with the Western Dye Industry, was abolished. It is a narrow and complete group. Our association has been handling the aforementioned consolidation for several months, and the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau have repeatedly ordered compliance. Furthermore, at the mediation convened by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 21st of last month, the first item was: (1) Gonghe Lai and other sixteen companies should join the Western Dye Industry Association to strengthen unity and must join before the end of November, etc., which has been reported to the higher authorities for record. Gonghe et al. have already submitted their applications to join the association in compliance with the order. Since your company's joining our association is within the scope of determined consolidation, you should fulfill the obligation to join without any delay or excuse that can be changed. Moreover, tracing back, your company has always regarded the Western dye industry as the basic business entity, which goes without saying. Even if your letter claims to be engaged in the dyeing and weaving industry concurrently, you should also join the respective industry associations separately in accordance with the law in order to comply with the legal system. In this case, no matter how much the Western dye business of your company declines, it is a disguise to resist and quibble. In short, your company holds dissenting opinions, which are close to disobeying the orders of the higher authorities, which is inappropriate. Therefore, we urgently reject your appeal and hope that your company will investigate and promptly contact our association's consolidation committee members Li Shiyan and Wang Zuolin to obtain the application form, fill it out, and submit it to our association for verification and transfer. Please do not wait and see and miss the opportunity. This is very important.' Upon investigation, the factory is one of the sixteen companies that the higher authorities mediated and consolidated. In fact, legally and commercially, there is an extreme need to fulfill the obligation, and there is no room for debate or avoidance. The matter concerns mediation on record, and we hereby request you to investigate accordingly. Gentlemen, you are responsible for the whole group of sixteen companies and have the full authority to handle the consolidation. Please provide a sincere and thorough explanation and submit the application form to our association as soon as possible to complete the procedures and determine the unity, and please inform us of the progress of the handling as soon as possible so that we can handle it. We are extremely looking forward to it, etc."</p>

<p>Dear Editor, I recently read in your newspaper's local news section the section on Zheng Xiangqian's dangerous injuries, which stated that Zheng Xiangqian, who runs the Yucheng Doumai Firm, also runs the Jiuchongtian Club in Taiyuanfang in the French Concession. I was deeply shocked. The so-called Zheng Xiangqian is a distant cousin of the owner of our firm. He used to work in our firm but left due to some matters and has been making a living on his own for several years. He has nothing to do with our firm. What your newspaper reported is a difference of a thousand miles. It must be a rumor. I hereby ask you to correct it and publish it in the letter section to clarify the truth. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Shanghai Yucheng Shushu, December 16.</p>

<p>Wouldn't this count as a miracle? That in such a barren, desolate world there would be such a lovely bud produced. But the facts tell us that it certainly is. The Bud Society has been organized at the People's Livelihood Middle School, and it is expected to have a permanent life.</p>
<p>To put it simply, there are several young people still at the People's Livelihood Middle School who have a sense of national consciousness and are enthusiastically willing to work, struggle, advance, and sacrifice for our own art, and to establish a new life for art. Therefore, they have organized a small group to irrigate it with a spirit and power of cooperation, so that this nascent bud will gradually flourish and grow.</p>
<p>They are divided into drama, music, art, and literature departments, which shows that their organization is complete and their purpose is pure. It is definitely not like the general blind youth societies of the time, which have neither clear doctrine nor understanding, and even less content and reality.</p>
<p>In short, the Bud Society, as its name gives us the image, is still a lovely flower bud that is about to bloom. The flowers that will bloom in the future will surely be very beautiful and vibrant. Moreover, it also symbolizes the greatness of the eve of the great era of the future.</p>

<p>The open road of the times is safely laid out before our eyes. The revolutionary vigor fills the whole country. The general trend of youth literary works is like a rising wind and surging clouds. This is indeed a good phenomenon in China's academic circles, worthy of admiration and dancing.</p>
<p>Of course, the literary groups in various universities are the ones who promote the brilliance of the academic world. Generally, young students with creative desires are unwilling to bury their talents, so in their spare time, they are organizing various societies and associations like rain after spring shoots to express their new spirit of life.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Second Academy of Culture started this semester, the school has been striving to improve. The new campus has been purchased at Wenzhi Road, Jiangwan. It is said that bids for the construction of its large-scale Western-style building will be invited soon. All professors in various departments are scholars with specialized research at home and abroad, so the progress of students' achievements is improving day by day, almost by leaps and bounds. In recent months, the general students have spared no effort in promoting the new culture and are full of energy. The rise of those literary groups is really colorful and varied, all showing amazing brilliance. The most trusted and praised by the students is the Class of 1920 of the Law Department. Among them, enthusiastic and responsible members such as Sun Zhide, Li Jiarong, Lai Jian, and Li Yuyue are willing to sacrifice for the association affairs, and they all show a gentle and friendly attitude towards the students, which is indeed worthy of the students' trust and admiration. It is now heard that the association is publishing a quarterly journal. Since the solicitation of manuscripts, students have been enthusiastically contributing. The content is divided into essays, current affairs reviews, and literary works. The materials are abundant, which goes without saying. In particular, there are the most works on the exploration of social sciences, the interpretation of legal principles, and national consciousness. The entire length is as much as 200,000 words, which is truly a huge publication in Shanghai's student circles. It is now actively being printed and will be published in the near future. It is also heard that it has been agreed with a certain bookstore to be its agent.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Wang Tiehua After the Law School Was Registered <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Education approved the establishment of the Shanghai Law School on the 4th of this month, the news spread and the whole school rejoiced. Immediately, more than 700 students and faculty gathered in the large first classroom (the auditorium is about to begin construction) to hold a temporary general meeting. It was decided that all faculty, staff, and students would go to the North Railway Station to welcome Provost Shen, who had been working hard in Beijing awaiting orders. Although there was no definite knowledge of which train Provost Shen would return on, everyone, unable to contain their enthusiasm, immediately hired a long line of cars, waved flags, and shouted, heading straight to the North Station from Jiangwan Road.</p>
<p>Express trains and fast trains all arrived, but our handsome Provost Shen was nowhere to be seen. We were not disappointed; we still returned to school in a grand and orderly fashion, because other work was waiting for us to carry out.</p>
<p>The sunlight after the rain was shining on our school, making it feel exceptionally bright and warm, like the arrival of new life. The sunlight shone brightly on the five characters of our "Shanghai Law School" plaque.</p>
<p>The students of the whole school were wildly joyful, and slogans were posted all over the school. Clever sayings poured out like a string of pearls. The Anhui Provincial Association hung a banner at the school gate with the large characters "Continue the Efforts After Registration." Upon entering through the main gate, both sides of the path were filled with slogans from various grade associations, provincial associations, and academic societies, full of praise and blessings, both serious and humorous. Some examples include: "Celebrate the Success of Registration," "Support the Dedicated Educators President Chu and Provost Shen," "Although Registration Has Succeeded, Students Must Work Harder," "Registration is the Result of Effort, but Also the Beginning of a New Start," "Create the Highest Academic Institution in the East, Which Should Be the Goal After Registration." The most interesting ones boldly proclaimed, "Welcome Provost Shen, Who Has Contributed Greatly," and "Welcome Provost Shen's Triumphant Return." Mr. Shen was working tirelessly on the Jing-Hu Road (Beijing-Shanghai Railway) for the school's registration, submitting the final designs and plans for the auditorium and library. Therefore, the news of the registration's approval reached the school through Mr. Shen's telegram. The students did not hesitate to go to the station to welcome Mr. Shen, which shows their love for the school and their deep respect for Mr. Shen.</p>
<p>Amidst the school-wide celebration, the members of the "Law Research Association," who always lead the elite, became even busier. While rushing to complete a 300,000-word "Law Journal," they had to take the time to express their enthusiastic congratulations. Under the clock tower in the classroom, they hung a large banner with the large characters "Celebrate the Success of Registration" written in beautiful and eye-catching fonts. On either side were couplets more than ten feet long, which read:</p>
<p>"The whole school rejoices, seeing today smiles blooming, slogans flying like butterflies, banners dancing like dragons, it is the beginning of a new life. Come, come, let us all shout 'Long live the Law School!' We should encourage each other, remembering the hard work of the past, the foundation firmly established, the reputation soaring like an eagle, wanting to realize a grand plan. Forward, forward, dare to encourage our comrades to avoid one day's heat and ten days' cold."</p>
<p>Our Mr. Shen, on the second day, in the smiling sun and the embrace of the train, smilingly walked slowly out of the station. After a brief delay at home, he hastily arrived at the school. President Chu also came. The whole school was filled with excitement. The chairmen and committee members of various class associations were busy holding meetings to discuss how to celebrate. Slogans, like butterflies, were constantly pasted all over the school, piled on top of each other, attracting students from neighboring schools to come and visit. The Songhu (Shanghai-Hangzhou) trains constantly passed by the school gate, almost causing the passengers to crane their necks out of the carriages. The enthusiasm was truly indescribable, beyond the ability of my clumsy pen to describe.</p>
<p>The school authorities were naturally as happy as the students. Knowing that the students were eager to see the provost, they did not wait for the memorial week next Monday but held a general meeting on this Saturday afternoon, where Provost Shen reported on the process.</p>
<p>Amidst the welcoming cheers of more than 1,500 hands, Mr. Shen took the stage with a voice filled with emotion. A ray of sunlight was shining in from the west window, and a gentle breeze was blowing his beautiful beard. He couldn't help but smile. His speech was slightly trembling. At this moment, Mr. Shen was experiencing indescribable joy.</p>
<p>He first described the school's efforts and the process of applying for registration over the years, with witty remarks that excited the whole audience. When he talked about registration being like a man proposing to a woman, the female students laughed uncontrollably. Mr. Shen stood tall on the stage, his demeanor no less than when he was a groom in his younger days. He said that the success of registration was like a man getting a woman's consent to his proposal and being able to get married, equally joyful, but marriage is a person's joy, while the success of registration is the joy of all the faculty and students. Finally, he encouraged the students to work harder in the future and guaranteed that next year's graduates would be able to hold the ceremony in the new auditorium, and at the same time, there would be a 100,000-yuan fundraising to build a large library and purchase a large number of books.</p>
<p>There are only two weeks left before the summer vacation. To celebrate and commemorate, we will hold a ceremony for the completion of the school building and the laying of the foundation stone for the grand auditorium on Friday and Saturday of next week, as well as a grand entertainment fair. At that time, we will, of course, invite guests to come and give us their guidance.</p>
<p>Writing to this point, a sense of joy and celebration spontaneously rushes to my fingertips. My heart is beating passionately, and my hand is trembling so much that I can no longer write. However, I would like to excerpt a few sentences from a declaration by the Class of 1931 Association to conclude this article:</p>
<p>"Our school was established in the 15th year of the Republic of China (1926) and has experienced many ups and downs. Fortunately, danger could be turned into safety... President Chu came to lead our school, and Mr. Shen assisted him... In no time, it transformed from a law college with nothing to a law school with a solid foundation... It is heard that the Ministry of Education approved the registration a few days ago. Upon hearing this, the whole school went wild. In this cheering, we still hope that the two gentlemen will actively plan the development of the school, aiming to rival Oxford University, to wash away the shame of backwardness in Eastern education... It is believed that the day of registration is the time to start, to build on the past and usher in the future, relying on the two gentlemen. Zhuangzi said, 'Its beginning is simple, its end will be great.' Applying this to our school, it is very close..."</p>

<p>Reunion with Happy Owner</p>
<p>Mr. Krenger is a well-known European economist and industrialist. He recently traveled to the United States and visited his old friend Mr. C. W. Nash at the Nash Motors factory in Kenosha. The reunion of old friends was unspeakably joyful. In 1928, Mr. Nash had visited Stockholm, Sweden, and stayed for four days, receiving very hospitable treatment from Mr. Krenger. This was their first meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. Krenger is the globally renowned Match King. Mr. Nash is the world-admired automotive giant. The two have similar aspirations and are very close. In the beginning, they had no capital or power. However, they were able to endure hardship and hard work, which led to their great achievements today. One of these two is a mechanic, and the other is a transporter.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Krenger and Mr. Nash are major shareholders of the Lee Higginson Bank. Mr. Krenger's mission to the United States this time was to attend the opening ceremony of the Chicago branch of the Lee Higginson Bank. He took the opportunity to visit his old friend at his residence and also tour the famous scenic spots of the western United States.</p>
<p>In 1893, the World's Fair was held in Chicago, USA. Mr. Krenger went to the United States to seek a job. At first, he bought and sold real estate for others, earning a small commission. After accumulating fifty dollars, he left the United States and crossed the ocean. Today, Mr. Krenger is revisiting Chicago. The situation is very different, and he must have infinite feelings. And Mr. Krenger's situation is also very different.</p>
<p>This time, the Match King's visit to the United States was very welcomed by all sectors. The Chicago Industrial Association held a special banquet to entertain him. Mr. Krenger gave a speech on his views on solving the problem of repaying international public debt. His opinions were profound, and his words were long. Mr. Krenger is very familiar with debt matters and has rich experience. Therefore, Mr. Krenger is not only the Match King but also a debt expert.</p>
<p>It is found that the Swedish Match Factory supplies matches for 600 million people worldwide every day. It controls the match business in Europe, Asia, and South America and has exclusive sales rights. Mr. Krenger's ability to absorb world finance can only be rivaled by one or two people. The Swedish government's treasury relies on the factory's taxes, which are about ten million gold or more each year.</p>
<p>During Mr. Krenger's visit to the Nash Motors factory, he greatly praised the mechanical capabilities, movement styles, and equipment engineering of the new Nash Motors and was extremely satisfied. It is said that Nash Motors are as popular in Europe as they are in the Americas.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Automotive Manufacturing Plant Construction Plan Wufi <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>In the past ten years, for the construction of highways, driving cars, national figures, have not been that the only construction in terms of developing transportation. As the road is opened, the automotive industry also followed it. In the backward of scientific our country, the only one item is purchased from the ship. Although the road construction in our country is more and more developed, it turns to more market for selling automotives for Euroupe and America. I don’t know how many profits were seized. That is one. Namely our country's major cities, have a so-called automotive company, whose above is merely to install various components into a car, and below is only to repair parts, configure tires only. If you say you can set up a factory to manufacture national automotive products, it is like a phoenix feather. That is two. Therefore, I think repairing roads, convenient transportation, is a current important issue. Manufacturing automotive products, is a strategies to recover profits. I had similar discuss and publish on last year. Recently "Construction Commission Working Plan Outline", for the construction plan of automotive manufacturing plan, its development process is divided into four phase of working plans. The plan is very detailed, so let's copy the full text as left, so that automotive workers and consumers will know.</p>
<p>National economy and people's livelihood are called traffic, the total reason is to promote in the shortest period, complete one million miles of road. At the same time, set up factories in appropriate places to manufacture automobiles, in order to transport and benefit the people's journey. Now the completed national highway is no less than 20,000 miles. Acting of the last training, quite efforts. The only the problem of automotive manufacturing is still not planned and held, which leads to daily vehicles, relying on foreign countries. Unfortunately. It found that the total amount of automotive imported in 18th year of the Republic of China(1929) was more than 3,600 vehicles. The value is more than 10 million, so the big of missing can be seen.</p>
<p>At this time of national unity, construction is the beginning, all business is bound to prosper. And the tools of action are also increasingly urgent. This Association inspects the trend of transportation development in other countries, and examines the daily needs of the people. Intending to follow President Sun Yat-Sen's will and in the shortest period, set up factories in Shanghai or other convenient transportation places, and manufacture automotive and similar action tools. From a small scale, specialized in manufacturing relatively simple commercial automobiles, i.e. long-distance automotive and transport vehicles, and training specialized workers talent. Second, gradually expand equipment, increase product types and production. First with set and copy. Continue to plan, test and manufacture new vehicles. Make sure the vehicles are suitable for our country's road conditions, and the raw materials used are mainly obtained from the country. In the future, all the vehicles needed in the country, small gasoline boats, and airplanes, etc., can be manufactured by the plant. If so, it can recover profits to the outside world and promote industry and commerce to the inside. National economy and people's livelihood, real benefits rely on. The construction and development process of the automotive manufacturing plant is divided into four phases. Each phase is three years. The main work of each phase is outlined below.</p>
<p>The first phase is the entrepreneurial period. The main work in this period should be temporarily limited to assembling foreign components and manufacturing commercial automotive body, frame, springs, and other simple parts. It can also be gradually copied. In the early years, one car can be produced per day. After the workers' skills are improved, it can be increased to three vehicles per day. The equipment must include a factory site, assembly plant, woodworking plant, metalworking plant, forging plant, painting plant, engine test room, office, drawing room, garage, warehouse, power engine, air compressor, woodworking machine, metalworking machine, forging machine, and corresponding hand tools, etc. All machinery and tools must be temporarily simple and able to manufacture the above-mentioned goods. However, the scale of the factory site and factory buildings must be relatively large in order to develop in the future. The initial capital required is approximately 800,000 yuan. Later, increase by 400,000 yuan each year. The total investment for the entire period is 1.6 million yuan.</p>
<p>The second phase is the imitation phase. In addition to continuing the work of the first phase and increasing the output, the important parts of automotive products should be imitated, such as transmission mechanisms. Walking mechanism. Starting mechanism and the body of the recreational automotive, etc. The output can be increased year by year according to the previous method. By the end of this period, five commercial vehicles, five recreational vehicles, and two agricultural vehicles must be produced every day. The equipment must include the expansion of all the equipment in the first phase, and the addition of a recreational automotive body manufacturing plant and the machinery required by the two plants. The capital increases by an average of 800,000 yuan each year. The total capital increase for the entire period is 2.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>The third phase is the design and manufacturing phase. In addition to continuing the work of the previous phase, the main parts of the entire automotive must be designed, tested, and manufactured by itself. The output can also be increased year by year according to the previous method. To the extent that it can produce ten commercial vehicles, one recreational vehicle, five agricultural vehicles, five motorcycles, and two electric vehicles per day. The equipment must include the expansion of all the equipment in the previous phase, and the addition of a test room and test equipment. The capital increases by an average of 2 million yuan each year. The total capital increase for the entire period is 6 million yuan.</p>
<p>The fourth phase is the expansion phase. In addition to continuing the work in phases, the business can be expanded as much as possible and the types and quantities of vehicles can be increased. At the same time, plan and manufacture small gasoline boats. Military vehicles. and aircraft. By the end of this period. Manufacturing capacity. Must reach the limit of 20 commercial vehicles per day. Forty recreational vehicles. Ten agricultural vehicles. Ten motorcycles. Five electric vehicles. and ten military vehicles per month. Five small gasoline boats. Five aircraft. The equipment must include the expansion of all the equipment in the previous phase. A shipyard should be added. Aircraft factory. and the machinery required by the two plants. The capital increases by an average of 4 million yuan each year. The total increase for the entire period is 12 million yuan. The total capital for the above four phases is 22 million yuan.</p>
