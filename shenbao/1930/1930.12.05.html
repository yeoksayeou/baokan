<h3>世界經濟與國交</h3>
<p>世界今日之不安皆起於經濟之不能調洽而國際間之不和亦多由此而起於今急求救濟經濟之危急者爲英美兩國如英銀行家之主張英美合作以二十對一之定率鞏固銀對金之價值以求佔及人類半數之東方人民增加其購買力挽回世界商業之降落其言有曰如目前形勢不亟謀補救則國債之否認與工業之革命成將發生其重視蓋有如此者但余以爲不根本改變工商業之組織而僅致力於金銀之價值雖能挽救一時仍非長久之策也又如美國勞工聯合會會長之估計美國失業人數共達四百八十六萬人如照目下之率繼長增高則至明年二月間將超過七百萬人云又如蘇格蘭煤礦罷工將有蔓延全英之勢又如德國與美國共産黨與警察之衝突日有所聞</p>
<p>此皆受經濟之影響也</p>
<p>至於國際間以意大利爲中心之七國同盟説亦因不能應大戰後所定之賠欵受經濟上之壓迫爲其結合之原因意德俄與土匈布希七國中除意俄外皆爲應付賠欵者而非應得賠欵者其趨勢料可知矣</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>付之一笑</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>夫—吾愛我的袍子上又沾了油漬了你喚王媽給我用汽車油擦刷一下</p>
<p>妻—算了你不要又使伊難受了</p>
<p>夫—這是甚麽話我們出錢僱用了伊難道不能喚伊做些零碎的事情麽</p>
<p>妻—不是的只爲伊去年愛上了一個汽車夫恩愛得了不得近二月來那汽車夫别有所愛和伊斷絶了因此伊一聞着了汽車油的味兒就要傷心落淚</p>
<p>富家婦（出外散步遇了雨在一家小商店中躱雨隨意和店夥交談）—那雨越下越大了眞可厭得很</p>
<p>店夥—是的你不妨在這裏多等一會</p>
<p>富家婦—平日間你是很忙的今天可清閒多了</p>
<p>店夥—是啊你看這麽大的雨還有甚麽生意有身分的太太們都不肯出來了</p>
<p>甲女（向伊未婚夫的姊姊説）—姊姊新年快到了我想買些東西送給你的弟弟</p>
<p>乙女—弟弟還没有東西送給你你何必如此客氣</p>
<p>甲女—但是我想不出甚麽東西來你是他和姊姊總比我更知道些他的脾氣他喜歡甚麽</p>
<p>乙女（想了一想含着笑説）—我看你還是送些容易押當容易變賣的東西給他吧</p>
<h3>最小的問題（上）</h3>
<p>— 振鐸</p>
<p>—楊杏佛先生的講演—</p>
<p>去年的某日楊先生到吴淞中國公學來他是中公的校董並且也被學校邀過了好幾次今天據他説是被拉了來才演講的</p>
<p>楊先生的演講也許没有當面聽見過不過楊先生演講的名望恐怕誰也知道的了所以一等楊先生上了台望着他嘴唇上那一堆小鬚髭每一個人幾乎都張着嘴笑了他説（前略）今天我所要和你們討論的是一個最小的問題你們看現在的滿洲里日本人拿出他們經營慘淡的統計表拿所有僑民的數目比較起來他們説在這種需要之下滿洲里是應該給他們據有的在國際情形之下是這樣在日本眼光中也是這樣然而我們祗會説我們的東西應該是我們的再壞些也不給你們對於根本辦法一些也没有</p>
<p>再看看現要的政治和革命現象混亂得象什麽樣子於是誰都在説中國是没有辦法的了祇等待着若亡國吧消極和悲觀和人生觀可以説是極普遍的那末我們問中國爲什麽弄不好他會説那當局的人不行不能辦事那末再問爲什麽他們不行你爲什麽不去想出些辦法來他絶對會説這是環境不好那末我們想想看這種環境是誰造成的就是眼前的内亂和政治的現象那是暫時的那末我們最小的問題是什麽就是我們這班智識階級的覺悟中國所以弄不好幾千年以來就是這一班讀書人的世界弄得太混亂他們以爲讀書有是高於一切的農工商是爲讀書人耕種工作的農工商要抬高自已的位置就不得不設法將自已鑽到所謂（士）的裏面去一入了（士）的階级似覺身份就抬高了許多以前你們看做軍人的人他們都能寫幾筆大字他們以爲這是讀書人的表現不會做文章的人也請人作了簽了自已的名字這是表示他也是高於一切中的一個（士）人</p>
<p>所以在這種現象之下什麽都弄不好不要説科學連農業工業商業都把自己的兒子去念書以爲人要出頭就非念書不可想想這是什麽現象</p>
<p>且看看我們現在國際上的情形看得中國人簡直和亡國奴還不如人家以爲和中國人在一起那是恥辱的事中國的國際代表到日本去不也是一樣受了侮辱回來中國在一切地位上現在成了什麽樣子這眞使人痛心的</p>

<h3>歐游通訊（八十七）</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>巡禮意大利日記</p>
<p>（三）羅馬十日（十）</p>
<p>第三日——德拉亞Ｔrajan圓柱——聖彼得梵訶里教堂</p>
<p>我的游覽羅馬街市原欲發見羅所以成爲永遠之都的緣故所以游覽市街的興趣倒並不在闊綽繁華的大街乃在有殘石和廢墟和斷碣的僻壞這也並不是單爲了它那可愛的古色都因的這些殘石和斷碣上滿綴着浮雕從這些浮雕裏還可以看出當日的傳説和故事</p>
<p>從我們的住所經過車站在陽光逼耀着的石路上走去約莫十多分鐘就到德拉亞Trajan圓柱廣塲在這個大廣塲的中央樹立一支高一百四十七呎的大理石巨柱轟立於碧蔚的空中顯出異乎尋常的莊嚴和偉大</p>
<p>德拉亞大帝的和平的光榮可以在樹立於這公衆塲所之中的圓柱上看出來這圓柱是羅馬帝國所有一切的紀念坊中保存得最好和一個</p>
<p>圓柱的下部是一間石室内藏德拉亞大帝的骸灰圓柱是立在一個小丘之上的有公衆廣塲圍繞而廣塲墻上也都有浮雕這種浮雕旣不是埃浮土Ｅphise地方的亞德米寺Artemis的上部浮雕也不是亞令比Olympie和台爾佛Delphes的聖壇周遭的浮雕所可比擬Ｔrajan的浮雕的石室之上所竪圓柱高至四十三米突眞是一偉大的建築這個石柱之下有由二十三塊大理石所結合而成的精巧無縫的石室</p>
<p>圓柱的浮雕上的故事不下一百二十五叚共有人物二千五百個由經過達尼白Danude起首至達司Daces京城舍米實易土塞SarmzeGethusa之陷落蠻王竇塞巴爾Ｄecebale自殺爲止均極詳明雕刻不僅以表現戰事爲滿足即在迦爾巴德Ｃarpathes的岩石上和森林中經過的情景也歷歷在目那些物的服飾尤其是考古家的珍貴的材料達尼白人的形狀與服裝和羅馬人相對照是絶然不同的就是亞歷山大時代的希臘藝術也没有這種像眞的態度誠然建築這個圓柱那時候用了不少的希臘雕刻家但是這些雕刻家是由羅馬接受了一種靈感才能完成這種百世不磨的偉大的業蹟</p>
<p>自從德拉亞的圓柱建立以後這種歷史上的偉跡在羅馬漸漸成了傳統的藝術後數世紀意在利文藝復興的彫刻中所發生的藝術也是淵原於此呢惟有這種藝術如是生動如是新穎如是豐富才能給與人類永遠的慰藉</p>

<h3>結束時期之銀洋狀况</h3>
<p>今年銀錢業遂奉國府命令國曆結賬故一應手續槪須預事籌備惟事屬創舉應付頗感困難緣是對於放欵上格外審愼而尤須顧及債務方面之困難苟須兼籌並顧似非通融辦理不可是以目前之業務上消息除一片收賬聲外實鮮要聞足資紀述耳</p>
<p>厘拆升降不一（洋厘）早市人心稍堅收盤價遂高二毫半爲七錢二分四厘半午市更爲生色市價竟抬半厘爲七錢二分五厘惟交易不多市氣不甚堅穩恐日内仍須回落耳（銀拆）早市八分午市五分劃頭白劃掛牌無市形勢之鬆滯又現上月間空閑時之氣象逆料目下收束時期祗收不放頭襯當然充裕宜其銀根之不易升色也</p>

<h3>大夏社會工作班赴蘇參觀記</h3>
<p>— 楊企静</p>
<p>社會學之在中國可説剛在很幼稚的時期亦可説是正在萌芽時代所以中國各大學對於社會學的注意也正是幾年的事迄今各大學中之社會學系的設立仍是没有普遍因之中國社會救濟事業的没有良好現象也正是當然的狀態大夏大學的社會系固然不能説而不敢説是中國東南部之最好的社會系然無論如何至少還可以相信大夏的社會系是在進步和發展的路上走的從民國十七年校中聘請社會學專家是吴澤霖博士來担任該系主任後在這兩年中就不斷地更是蒸蒸日上大可與燕大之社會學系相並美而大夏每學期所開社會系的學程意然爲滬上各大學之冠這是事實如此也用不着我來多所形容</p>
<p>這學期的大夏社會學系更從理論的探討進而求社會事實的研究其中最重要的課程自然要算社會工作和社會調查二學程而這兩學程都是吴博士親</p>
<p>自出馬担任的所以於進行上更覺得起勁其課程的計劃是這樣的社會工作是研究各國社會救濟事業之理論和實施的槪况同時對於中國社會救濟事業的情形加以考察并討論如何纔可使其改良所以這學程的講授情形也一方在講堂裏講解理論一方則出外參觀加以檢討此外社會調查班也是如此是同時做實騐工作進行調查大夏新村附近的農民生活槪况的實際情形作有系統的事實研究除社會調果班上的工作報告不在本文範圍内而不述外茲述這次社會工作班赴蘇參觀的情形及參觀所得的感想報告如下</p>
<p>赴蘇參觀唯一的日標是在蘇州的福音醫院中的瘋人院據説這個瘋人院在中國除在廣州的一個外要算是最好的我們得到該院的允許我們就决定赴蘇順便又可參觀蘇州其他的社會救濟機關</p>
<p>此行我們是约着光華的社會工作班同學一同去的光華有十三有大夏有十七人合計連教授共三十一人那天剛巧是陰霾密佈大風緊刮可是我們鼓着熱烈的慾望我們是毫不畏縮地前進了</p>
<p>當我們到蘇州跨下火車的時候車站外即已排列着整齊的三十幾輛人力車這是我們在事前已請好一位同學先來籌備的這樣三十幾輛人力車一字兒地在蘇州街上迅速地飛跑着當然的影響會引起兩旁商店中的伙計以及行人等的注意全他們似乎是很驚奇的看着這許多穿洋服的人坐着這許多輛的人力車飛樣似的過去</p>
<p>我們是先去參觀我們唯一的目的地—福音醫院蒙該院主任醫師的慇懃招待和指示我們的希望是很歡樂地達到了其中醫治瘋人的部份是另闢一院的這時所收留瘋人的數目約有七十人之譜男的有四十餘女的有二十餘然可驚異而堪注意的據參觀詢問的結果此巨數的瘋人中幾乎都是有相當的學問的男的方面竟然有兩個是留學生得有學位的女的方面有的是聖瑪利亞的教員有的是禆文女學的教員亦有的是曾經服務過中央黨部的而其發生瘋病的原因據説幾乎都是爲着經濟和婚姻兩大問題所支配的結果這就是值得注意的問題值得研究的事實</p>
<p>福音醫院瘋人部所收留的瘋人是否可用作標準來研究中國的瘋人問題這自然我亦不敢武斷的説可以然此中的情形已經是事實這就是值得討論的事實或許亦可暫認爲是可代表的事實則瘋人之在智識份子中的容易産生就可依據此中事實而言而中國近年經濟制度的動搖以及婚姻制席在新舊交替的過程中以致促成多量瘋人的産生這也是事實這都是社會服務機關應當注意的事實</p>
<p>其次我們朝育嬰堂去看蘇州的育嬰堂可説是完全舊式中的較好者從表面上他們的房間還是高大寛敝的衣服器具等也還清潔然而祇有一大房間密密在排佈着四五十個嬰兒則於空氣光綫方面自然是不夠充足更一究此四五十嬰兒狀態我們祗聽到呱呱的哭聲而細視其面容多半是帶有病色的此種狀態在該機關辦事人的心目中似乎是不懂得樣的毫没有拿出他們的注意力而注意到這些</p>
<h3>會塲外</h3>
<p>— 冰攝</p>
<p>再次看到老人堂這是一所很大却是汚穢不堪的内中共收留有兩三百個年老的婦人其設備的情形可説是一個貧民窟的累積而成我實在不好意思去形容它我實在了不敢説這是二十世紀中文明國的社會貧因救濟機關</p>
<p>最後我們跑到婦女救濟會去看了一下這好像是特地佈置起等着我們去參觀似的所以就很難觀察出其中平時的情形和待遇不過該會中懸掛着有幾張圖表的統計却是很精細的也還值得注意</p>
<p>此外我們還順價地參觀了一下江蘇第三監獄但我不願意叙述此中情形和參觀後的感想因我覺得這是政治上設施的問題就讓它留待此後其他與此有關係的機會時再談吧我們就這樣在一天内參觀了以上所述的五個機關而當天晚車就返滬了</p>
<p>總之這次參觀的結查我們人對中國社會救濟機關的設施至少有以下的感想我覺得中國社會救濟機關的設施太缺乏科學化辦事人幾乎是絶對没有科學的精神差不多把這些事業完全交給老成持重的一批人在那辦理而他們根本不懂得救濟社會上之病態的目的底因之現有的救濟方法都是偏於倫理的觀念祇認爲救其生命延其殘喘就以爲盡慈善之能事毫不思及積極的救濟予病態者以正當的出路這是值得注意的事業望堂社會事業之責者有以思及而改良之</p>
<h3>同樂會</h3>
<p>— 英</p>
<p>秋朝寂寂地陶醉在濃霧的温柔内橙紅色的朝陽緩慢的揭開紀念堂前楊公的銅像他毅然地直立著在他微笑的臉上斷續地流淌着瑩晶的露珠—也可説這是他歡欣的表現罷</p>
<p>幽揚的鐘聲摧起了睡夢中的學子笑—在每一個人的臉上都可以看見也許有幾位的態度是平淡的那末别人難免就要奇異地看他幾眼了</p>
<p>短針正指在九點的時候鐘聲又在各人的耳膜上振動了運動的人們停止了他們的工作看書的人們的靈魂也不由地牽進禮堂了</p>
<p>同樂會在中國也許就是這樣講罷…混亂…吵鬧…喧嘩…咒駡…嘘…我根本不明瞭什麽呌（樂）更不明瞭這樣的呌（樂）</p>
<p>學校附近花花的奶奶…拖着鼻涕的孩子…穿着新衣的娃娃還有咧連穿着大花鞋的緊迷着眼的老太太也來參加這個盛會呢</p>
<p>上半天我所感到有深的影像的就是一位先生彈的好似琵琶似的國樂他那（碎錦裂玉）的音調確是很少見的</p>
<p>午後我本不想再去的但是給如雷地呼聲聳恿着入了禮堂</p>
<p>人是更躋了重疊起來好似　座肉</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>山當我跨進去時就聽見幾個同學怪聲</p>
<p>好一個胡琴噫……噫</p>
<p>三弦也嘸啥……</p>
<p>嘘…嘘……</p>
<p>撤尿……</p>
<p>我不敢自已信任自已的判斷力了那裡是學校裏在開同學會簡直是同在中國戲院裏一樣地混亂呀</p>
<p>在我的觀察這次的盛會是長子和矮子便宜長子提起脚來就看得清矮子呢可以在人的肩膀下穿到前面去最不幸的是中等身材的人但是當嬌小窈窕的女士們跳起却爾斯登時天眞的孩子唱起可愛的婉歌時誰肯屈服呢</p>
<p>矮子的工作因之急促了長子也盡力提起脚來中等身材的人們終於咆哮了在猪　的咒聲下毫不急迫的站起來了</p>
<p>他們厚着皮直直地站着没有什麽人能使他们皮薄了下來將身子蹲下去也許有—起碼也要等臺上表演的女士們將脚高提的時候了</p>
<p>混亂…喧嘩…吵閙…就是中國人所謂的（同樂）了不錯的混亂在中國人當熱鬧講混亂就是中國人所謂的……（樂）……呢</p>

<h3>National Government Orders Strict Prohibition of Officials Engaging in Commerce</h3>
<p>Nanjing The National Government issued an order on the 4th stating that administrative officials, having already devoted themselves to serving the nation, each have their respective duties to fulfill. They should selflessly forget personal interests and stay far from monetary gains, in order to prevent the gradual abuse of power for personal convenience. Engaging in commercial operations and manipulating profits is not only a disgrace to officialdom but also hinders government affairs, creating numerous malpractices and making it impossible to uphold law and discipline. Now is the time to rectify the system and strictly enforce the rule of law. All public officials should strive to purify themselves and strictly refrain from any acts of dereliction of duty for personal gain. Therefore, it is specifically prohibited that all levels of officials must absolutely not hold positions in commercial organizations or engage in speculative market transactions. Those who dare to deliberately violate this will be punished with dismissal. All those in positions of authority should be warned. This order (4th dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Economic Mission Received by National Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Received Them at the Government</p>
<p>Attended a Banquet at Wang's Residence Last Night</p>
<p>Nanjing Chairman Chiang received the British Far East Economic Mission at the First Conference Hall of the National Government at 4:30 PM on the 4th, and provided refreshments.

King, Commercial Counselor Potter, and Commercial Attache Zhou Erwan accompanied the mission, which included leader Sir Thomas Royden and members Allen Beale, and more than ten others to the Government.

(4th dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing Wang Zhengting hosted a banquet for the British Far East Economic Survey Group at his residence on the evening of the 4th, and delivered a speech on the spot, first expressing his welcome, then stating that this was the first time that British industrial and commercial leaders had organized a survey group to come to Nanjing. He noted that the commercial relationship between China and Britain has a long history. Fifty years ago, British goods accounted for 40% of all Chinese imports. However, since May 1925, the volume of British trade with China has declined sharply. By 1929, British exports to China had fallen to only 9.2% of China's total imports, a difference that is quite startling. The purpose of your visit to China is likely to investigate the true cause of the decline in Sino-British trade. According to general observations, the prospects for British trade with China are quite optimistic, and British cotton textiles are especially needed by the Chinese market. Furthermore, the progress of Sino-British trade will not only benefit Britain but also China. Tonight, I especially wish your mission success in its investigation, and we will certainly be willing to provide you with assistance. However, there is one point that I must mention to you: the prosperity or decline of international trade completely depends on the state of friendship between nations. Therefore, if one wants to develop trade, the first thing to do is to gain the favor of customers. Now that Sino-British relations are becoming increasingly friendly, what we are most pleased about is that during your investigation period, I am confident that you will obtain some new reference materials. In this regard, I must also hope that you will pay attention to British interests while also considering the needs of China. Finally, I wish you all good health and success, so that the friendship between China and Britain can be further advanced. It is also scheduled that the group members will pay respects at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum on the morning of the 5th, attend a lunch banquet hosted by Mayor Wei at noon, and a welcome banquet hosted by Sun Ke and Kong Xiangxi in the evening. On the morning of the 6th, all the group members will return to Shanghai by land and water. (4th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Left Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central Government Officials Crossed the River to See Him Off</p>
<p>Nanjing Zhang Xueliang's special train departed north at 8:10 PM on the 4th because his affairs in Nanjing had been completed. His staff and guards had arrived at Pukou earlier to board the train. Zhang himself went to various important people in the afternoon to bid farewell. From his residence to the Xiaguan wharf, the National Government Guard Brigade increased its guard posts along the way. At the Zhaoshang Wharf in Xiaguan, the Garrison Command and the Police Department sent teams to strictly guard the area, temporarily cutting off traffic. The security was extremely tight. Around 5:00 PM, the farewell party included He Yingqin and his wife, Zhu Peide, Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, Song Ziwen and his wife, Chen Lifu, Chen Yi, Kong Xiangxi, Zhou Yawei, Wang Boqun, Sun Bowen, Cao Haosen, Yu Jingtang, Wang Jiazhen, Chen Shaokuan, and Hu Hanmin, all of whom were ready to see him off on the Weishing warship. Li Shizeng, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, and Wei Daoming had already crossed the river and were waiting at Pukou station. After Zhang finished his farewells, he accompanied Yu Fengzhi and Zhu Guangmu to the headquarters for a farewell banquet hosted by Chairman Chiang. During the banquet, they had a final discussion on national affairs with the Chairman, which was very pleasant. At 7:30 PM, they took a car to the Xiaguan wharf. A burst of music erupted, and the military police saluted with their guns. The farewell party was also lined up on the corridor of the warship to show their respect. After Zhang boarded the ship, he shook hands with the farewell party one by one to thank them. Then, he boarded the upper deck of the Weishing warship and exchanged greetings with the farewell party. The Weishing warship then set sail to cross the river to Pukou. The security from the riverside wharf to the station was also extremely tight. The National Government also sent a military band to play music at the station. After Zhang arrived at the station, he boarded the train and thanked the farewell party, saying that he would visit the capital often in the future and asked them not to be too formal. The special train departed at 8:10 PM.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>World Economy and International Relations</h3>
<p>Today's global instability stems from the failure to reconcile economies, and international discord is often caused by this as well. Currently, the most urgent need to alleviate the economic crisis lies within Britain and the United States. For instance, British bankers advocate Anglo-American cooperation to stabilize the value of silver against gold at a fixed rate of twenty to one in order to increase the purchasing power of the Eastern population, which accounts for half of humanity, and to reverse the decline of world commerce. It is said that if the current situation is not quickly remedied, the denial of national debt and the revolution of industry may occur. However, I believe that simply focusing on the value of gold and silver without fundamentally changing the organization of industry and commerce, although able to salvage the situation temporarily, is not a long-term solution. Furthermore, the president of the American Federation of Labor estimates that the number of unemployed in the United States has reached 4.86 million. If the current rate continues to increase, it will exceed 7 million by February of next year. Moreover, the Scottish coal miners' strike is expected to spread throughout Britain. Furthermore, conflicts between German and American communist parties and the police are increasingly frequent.</p>
<p>These are all affected by the economy.</p>
<p>As for the seven-nation alliance theory centered on Italy in the international arena, it is also caused by the economic pressure of not being able to meet the reparations set after the Great War. Among the seven countries of Italy, Germany, Russia, Turkey, Hungary, Austria, and Bulgaria, except for Italy and Russia, all are dealing with reparations rather than receiving them. The trend is predictable.</p>

He said that this year's budget is $180,000,000 short, so the people can only hope to continue to reduce income tax by one percent. He stated that the deficit this year is not very large and that he is not anxious about it. He is confident that the general economic recovery will lead to a surplus budget. The revenue for the fiscal year ending June 1922 was $4,085,000,000.</p>
<p>(The revenue budget for 1930-1931 is $4,225,727,000.) The expenditure is $4,054,000,000 (the expenditure budget for the last term was $4,102,938,700). The defense expenditure budget is $690,000,000, a decrease of $34,000,000 from the previous term. It is planned to use $28,000,000 for naval construction. Combining this with the unused shipbuilding funds left over from the suspension of shipbuilding during the London Naval Conference, the total shipbuilding funds for 1932 will be $51,500,000. This amount will be used to continue building one aircraft carrier and seven 8-inch gun light cruisers, and to complete the work on the light cruisers and submarines that have already been built but not completed.

<p>Reducing Production is the Only Way to Remedy the Wheat Market</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, December 3rd: According to the annual report of the Secretary of Agriculture, the United States farmers' method of self-salvation lies in uniting to eliminate overproduction. The report mentioned wheat, believing that automatic production cuts are the only reasonable method to remedy the problem of oversupply. It also advocates reducing wheat fields with a flexible policy. It continued by discussing the cotton market, reiterating the importance of adjusting production to match demand. It also stated that in the past two years, there has been a trend of abandoning US cotton in favor of other countries' cotton. The price difference is less favorable to US cotton, and the quality difference is not as great as before. This year, US cotton production is about 14,486,000 bales, a decrease of 342,000 bales compared to 1929. This year's harvest can be considered sufficient to meet the world market's reduced demand with a surplus. US cotton consumption in the world in 1929-1930 decreased by 2 million bales compared to the previous term, while the consumption of Indian and other foreign cotton increased by 900,000 bales and 500,000 bales, respectively. The decrease in US cotton consumption in the world is due in part to the decrease in consumption by US cotton mills, and the remaining 1 million bales are equally split between Europe and the United Kingdom. Compared to the export volume of the previous term, this year's exports to Germany decreased by 6 percent, exports to the United Kingdom decreased by 32 percent, and exports to Japan decreased by 21 percent. In the year ending June 1930, the low level of US agricultural exports was unprecedented since 1915. Except for forest products, exports of agricultural products all decreased. It is found that this year's agricultural exports are worth a total of $1,495,000,000, a decrease of $352,000,000 compared to the previous year. Although the decrease in exports is not limited to cotton, the decrease in value is mostly due to the sluggish sales of US cotton and the lower average price.</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After learning the news of Chiang Kai-shek's arrival in Jiangxi, Lu Dipin, the commander-in-chief of the 9th Route Army, immediately telegraphed the provincial and prefectural governments to arrange a headquarters for Chiang. Preparations by all sectors of the province to welcome Chiang have also been largely completed. Colorful archways adorned with welcome slogans are erected on the main streets and intersections, which is quite beautiful. The Nanchang General Chamber of Commerce has also notified all businesses in the city to hang flags from the 1st until the day of Chiang's arrival in Jiangxi. To welcome Chiang, Commander Lu took a shallow-water warship from Ji'an at 7:00 AM on the 2nd and sailed straight down the Gan River. Around 4:00 PM, he arrived at Zhangshu, rested briefly, and then took a car to arrive in the province that evening. Upon hearing the news, all members of the provincial government went to Lu's residence in Beitan to pay their respects. Lu reported on the bandit suppression situation, saying that the main communist bandits had retreated to the Ningdu and Xingguo areas and would soon be wiped out. It is reported that Lu will personally go to Jiujiang during the day to welcome Chiang and inspect the defenses of northern Jiangxi and the disaster situation.

<h3>Recent Bandit Suppression Situation in Hunan Province</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: As Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek is about to arrive in Hunan to supervise the suppression of communist bandits, party and government agencies are preparing to welcome him. Regarding the recent bandit suppression situation in central Hunan, He Jian has compiled a summary report and submitted it to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and the Wuhan Headquarters for verification. The telegram is recorded as follows (abbreviations omitted): (1) The bandit Peng Dehuai's unit and Kong Hechong's entire force, which had long occupied Pingjiang, have been defeated by my Army Commander Liu Jianxu's Wang Dongyuan and Tao Guang divisions. Ma Wu has recovered Pingjiang County and is pursuing them towards Mingzhen Township. (2) The bandit Kong Hechong led more than 2,000 men and guns to seize Miluo and Xiangyin. They were routed near Baishui by a unit of my Peng Weiren and Li Jue divisions. They retreated to Xinshi. Now my Wang Dongyuan division has advanced from Pingjiang to Changle, cooperating with the Peng Weiren division to encircle them. Also, according to Army Commander Liu Jianxu's telegram, Kong's bandits were defeated by Tao Guang's division at Tanjiafang, and many were killed or captured. The bandits fled towards the Tongcheng area of ​​Bananao. A telegram has been sent to Tongcheng,</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Xie Bin's division is blocking them. Peng Weiren's division was ordered to quickly advance to Cenchuan and pursue the banditry to the Changle area in order to quell it, temporarily assigning the duties to the three divisions of Tong Kun, Ye Wenk, and Guo Bugao, and ordering Peng's forces to return to the provincial defense once the bandit situation is clear. 3. Wang Dongyuan's division and Hou Mingfei's brigade are ordered to quickly concentrate in the Yangshiling and Meixian areas. If the bandits occupy the Lijiadong or flee to Nanjiang Changshou, they should quickly be blocked and intercepted to prevent the bandits from having time to assemble the remaining forces and annihilate them all. In addition, Peng Shizhang's Weiren You Dian stated that Hu Ti and Liu Jianwen's regiments had advanced to Changle on the day before yesterday. A fierce battle was fought with Kong's bandits on the highlands northeast of Changle Street for several hours. The bandits attacked our forces with all their might several times. Our army bravely charged and killed the bandit battalion commander Li Sixiang, one of the bandit company platoon leaders and more than a dozen bandit soldiers, and 5-600 bandit soldiers, and captured 60-70 guns and countless spears. The Hu Regiment also suffered casualties of 5 company and platoon leaders and 60 to 70 soldiers. The bandits collapsed and fled in all directions to the small mountain roads of Tanjiafang and Cenchuan. It was decided that on the 27th, we will continue to search for the bandits. (3) The bandits who fled from Lianhua, Jiangxi, had more than 30 guns and 4-5,000 spears. They attacked Youxian on the 26th and were defeated by my Commander Duan Heng on the 27th. They fled to Chaling. We also killed more than 600 bandits in the pursuit. However, another group of bandits fled into the border of Chaling. We have ordered all the troops stationed in Chaling, Youxian, Lingling, and Liling to be under the command of Commander Duan to deploy defenses and intercept them. (4) The bandits He Long and Kuang Jixun, etc., were severely damaged at Nanhua Jin. They are now fleeing south from Shimen, and fell into Linli on the 26th, violating Changde and Tao. They are directing Hui Heng to lead Li Guojun, Xiang Keqing, He Ying, and other regiments, as well as the Changde and Tao teams to defend the line of Aoshan and Changlinggang, blocking them head-on. One unit of Zhang Ying's Sichuan Army is attacking from the side of Anxiang. The Linli Sichuan Army Ma Kunshan's brigade and Chen Quzhen's unit Chen Yun'Kui, Tian Shaoqing's two regiments, and the Zhou Xieqing Brigade of the Cili Sichuan Army are attacking Shimen to cut off the bandits' retreat. He's bandits abandoned Linli on the 27th because they could not take care of both ends, and returned to Shimen, and have already increased the dispatch of Li Jue's division from the province to Changde to provide support. Changde and Tao can be guaranteed to be safe. (5) There are no fewer than tens of thousands of scattered bandits in various parts of Liuyang, most of whom have spears, with guns and branches of only about 10%. My Chen Guangzhong's four regiments are now suppressing them in separate routes. In the past few days, more than a dozen bandit lairs have been destroyed and 2-3,000 bandits have been killed. The suppression is still continuing. The above five items are presented by He Jian (November 28th)</p>
<h3>Jin Army Remnants Reorganized into Ten Armies</h3>
<p>Army Commanders Newly Appointed</p>
<p>A List of the Defense Areas of the Ten Armies</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: After taking office as the Commander-in-Chief of the Jin-Sui Garrison, Xu Yongchang immediately began to reorganize the Jin Army. The reason was that the financial difficulties had reached an extreme, and without army reorganization, nothing could be done. To this end, Xu twice went to Wutai to meet with Yan Xishan, who also recognized the need for rapid reorganization, but knew that it was not difficult to reorganize the army, but difficult to settle the generals. Therefore, he summoned Li Fuying, Zhou Dai, Yang Aiyuan, Zhang Yingwu, Wang Jingguo, and other generals with real power in the three factions of southern Jin, northern Jin, and Baoding in Hebian Village, Wutai, to hold a reorganization meeting. As a result, it was generally decided which of the 18 armies should be cut and which should be retained. Xu left Wutai on the 23rd and returned to Taiyuan. On the 25th, in the name of the Commander-in-Chief of the Jin-Sui Garrison, he announced that eight of the original 18 armies of the Third Route Army would be cut, and ten armies would be retained. He also appointed Wang Jingguo, Li Fuying, Yang Chengyuan, Zhao Chengzhou, Zhang Huizhao, Feng Pengzhu, Yuan Qingzeng, Yang Yaofang, Sun Chu, and Yang Xiaoou as the army commanders of the Jin-Sui Garrison. The cut army commander Guan Fuan was transferred to the deputy commander of the Hedong Defense Zone, and Zhou Shilian was transferred to the director of the assessment office of the Military Reorganization Committee. The remnants of Guan's troops were merged into Yang Chengyuan's troops, and the remnants of Zhou's troops were merged into Yang Xiaoou's troops. Feng Yuxi was transferred to the Military Reorganization Committee, and his troops were merged into Yang Yaofang's troops. The names of the army commanders Li Shengda, Chuan Zuoyi, and others were cancelled, and they were transferred to the Military Reorganization Committee and the Jin-Sui Garrison Headquarters as senior consultants and advisors. Their remaining troops, which were already few, were merged into the units of Yuan Qingzeng and Sun Chu respectively. The above order was issued based on the resolutions of the meeting Yan Xishan held in Wutai, and no resistance has occurred. Therefore, Xu further redistributed the defense areas of each army, planning to allocate the first defense area to the Jinbei and Suiyuan areas, the second defense area to the inside and outside of Niangziguan in southern Jin and the area bordering Hebei Province, and the third defense area to the Hedong area bordering the Yellow River along the borders of Shaanxi and Henan provinces. The first defense area is Wang Jingguo's entire army stationed in Suiyuan. The 14th division of Li Fuying's army is opened in Wutai, the 15th division is opened in Guoxian, and the 13th division is stationed in Taiyuan. The first division of Yuan Qingzeng's army is stationed in Datong Gushan, and the two divisions are stationed in Yanmenguan. Zhang Huizhao's entire army is stationed on the Ping-Sui Railway line along Datong Pingdiquan Tianzhen Yanggao. The first division of Zhao Chengshou's army is stationed in Baotou, and the two divisions are stationed in the Ping-Sui Railway line west of Pingdiquan. The second defense area is the first division of Feng Pengzhu's army stationed in Niangziguan, one brigade stationed in Jingxing, and one division and two brigades stationed in Yangquan to Shuyang along the Zhengtai line. Two brigades of Yang Xiaoou's army are stationed inside and outside of Niangziguan, one division is stationed in Yuci, and the remainder is stationed in the Zhengtai Railway between Yuci and Taiyuan. The third defense area is Sun Chu's army stationed in Xinhjiang, Quwo, and Jiexiu, Yang Chengyuan's army stationed in Yuncheng, and Yang Yaofang's army stationed in Luan. All the armies in each defense area are under the jurisdiction of the Jin-Sui Garrison Headquarters in Taiyuan. Yan's most trusted former artillery commander Zhou Dai is the chief staff officer of the headquarters, in charge of the distribution of salaries and supplies. Yan's nephew Yang Aiyuan is the deputy commander of the Jin-Sui Garrison, assisting Xu Yongchang in commanding the entire army. In reality, Yang's power is above Xu's. However, the provincial chairman Shang Zhen, considering that Shanxi's finances have reached a dead end and the Jin banknotes of more than 96 million yuan cannot be maintained, believes that this military reorganization is not thorough enough. He told Xu Yongchang and Yang Aiyuan that if the current ten armies are calculated, the monthly salaries are still not enough. Xu and others also thought so, and planned to conduct a second reorganization while Yan had not yet gone abroad, cutting the current ten armies into six armies or reducing them into ten divisions. Xu plans to go to Wutai to negotiate in the next few days, but the current problem with the Jin Province army is not the number of soldiers, but the number of generals. Even with this reduction from 18 to 10 armies, not a few high-ranking generals are resentful due to losing their positions. If there is further reduction, the difficulties may increase.

<h3>The Issue of Moving the Government Seat of Puxian County, Shandong Province</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The county seat of Puxian County, which belongs to the former Caozhou Prefecture of this province, was originally located on the east bank of the Yellow River. Later, due to the Yellow River floods, it was moved to the west bank. However, four-fifths of the county's land is on the east bank, and only one-fifth is on the west bank. Therefore, the people on the east bank have repeatedly requested to move the county seat back to the east bank for many years, but the matter has been delayed due to opposition from the people on the west bank. A few days ago, the provincial government ordered the Department of Civil Affairs to review this case. The Department of Civil Affairs proposed a method to transfer the five townships in the west of the river to Guancheng and Fanxian counties, or transfer them all to Guancheng County, and the county seat would still be moved back to the east of the river. This was submitted to the provincial government's regular meeting today and was resolved that the Department of Civil Affairs would order the county to convene elderly people over the age of 70 from the east and west of the river, with ten from each side, and three to five impartial gentry from the old city of the county, to come to the province before the 20th of this month to discuss the method. The memorandum of the Department of Civil Affairs is recorded as follows: (After investigation, the area of the county on the east of the river accounts for four-fifths of the entire county, and the west of the river accounts for only one-fifth. The population comparison is also consistent. It seems inappropriate for the county seat to be located on the west of the river. If permission is granted to move the government, the people on the west of the river will rise up to resist. The Civil Affairs Agency thought again and again that only by formulating specific measures can the suspension case be resolved and the dispute be quelled. According to the report of the committee, the west of the county is divided into five townships. The Maling Township is connected to Guancheng County in this province. The Li Kangdian, Linhuang, Wufu, and Chengqu Townships are connected to Fanxian County. Moreover, the land of Guancheng and Fanxian counties is extremely narrow. Can the Maling Township be transferred to Guancheng County and the Li Kangdian, etc. Four townships are assigned to Fan County, or all transferred to Guancheng County. The Puxian County Government is moved to the east of the river, and the Civil Affairs Agency will first send personnel to the county with the Construction Agency for resurvey to facilitate demarcation. If there is any propriety in the proposal, the official reasons for submission please be inspected and approved for implementation (December 2nd)</p>
<h3>Liang and Sun's Troops Actively Transferring Defenses</h3>
<p>Liang Guanying Personally Goes to Qingjiangpu</p>
<p>Sun Lianzhong's Troops March to Western Shandong</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Liang Guanying, the commander-in-chief of the 25th Route Army, came to Xuzhou from Nanjing by special train on the 27th to command the transfer of his troops. Liang stayed at the Bao Xing Company. The troops that have been transported to the north of the Yangtze River are the 94th and 96th brigades of the 32nd Division, the 5th Independent Brigade, and various independent regiments. The headquarters of the commander-in-chief stationed in Shide also arrived at Xuzhou Station on the 30th, led by Chief of Staff Li Yuanhui. On the morning of the 1st, Liang led all personnel to leave Xuzhou by special train to the east, got off at the Grand Canal, and transferred to Qingjiangpu to command the suppression of bandits. The 95th Brigade of Liu Guoming also passed Xuzhou on the 2nd and opened east. The transfer of Liang's troops has been completed by this time. The 23rd Division of Li Yunjie's troops in Lanfeng has dispatched the 69th Brigade to Shide on the 30th to take over the defense.</p>
<p>Sun Lianzhong's troops of the 26th Route Army are stationed in the Xinxiang area. Sun went to Nanjing to see Chiang Kai-shek and was ordered to transfer his troops to western Shandong. After Sun arrived in Xinxiang, he ordered his troops to start moving. However, due to the lack of vehicles, they were divided into two routes: by vehicle and on foot. Those transported by vehicle took a car from Xinxiang, passed through Zhengzhou and Kaifeng to Xuzhou, went north to Yanzhou, and then transferred to Jining. Those on foot went directly from Xinxiang to Caozhou. It is reported that Sun's troops consisted of four infantry divisions, two cavalry divisions, one brigade, and one regiment. The officers were the 12th Division Commander Gao Shuxun, the 13th Division Commander Dong Zhentang, the 14th Division Commander Ji Zhendong, the 15th Division Commander Li Songkun, the 1st Cavalry Division Commander Zhang Huatang, the 2nd Cavalry Division Commander Zhu Changde, the Special Service Brigade Commander Gao Zhihe, and the Pistol Regiment Commander Huang Zhongyan, totaling about 70,000 people. It was stipulated that the 14th Division, the Special Service Brigade, and the General Headquarters should be transported by vehicle separately, and the rest should start on foot. After Liang's troops had finished moving, he led the General Headquarters from Xinxiang to Jining. Those marching on foot were divided into two echelons per division for ease of movement, and salaries, food, tea and water were provided at twelve stations along the way. It would take about two weeks to complete the transportation. As for the defenses left behind in Xinxiang, it is reported that they will be taken over by Wang Jinyu's 47th Division.

<h3>The Anti-Smoking Association Investigates and Prohibits the Garrison from Unauthorized Collection of Illegal Levies</h3>
<p>The Central Anti-Smoking Committee previously received a telegram from the Anti-Smoking Committee of the Fujian Provincial Government requesting that the military and political departments be informed by telegram to the military officers stationed in Fujian Province. In the future, when sending teams to assist in anti-smoking, they should be transferred to the courts for interrogation in accordance with the law, and they must not collect fines privately or collect illegal levies under false pretenses, so as to unify authority and strengthen the ban. After the Military Department approved the consultation, it has now ordered Liu Heding, the commander of the 56th Division of the Army stationed in Fujian, and Zhang Zhen, the commander of the newly編First Division, to convey the order to their subordinate units to comply with it and inform the Anti-Smoking Association for reference.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in South Manchurian Railway Revenue</h3>
<p>Revenue Down by 20 Million in Ten Months</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Since the Beining Railway has vigorously sought transportation development and implemented the joint transportation of various Northeast lines, the income from passenger and freight transportation has suddenly broken all previous records. As a result, the passenger and freight transportation of the South Manchurian Railway has plummeted, and the operating income has visibly decreased. According to the road's budget for this year, there are 5 million passengers. However, according to statistics for the past nine months, there were only 2,529,000 people, which is 51% less than the budget. Even by the end of December, it will not exceed 3.5 million people at most. In terms of passenger revenue, the budget is 14,428,000 yuan, but only 10.09 million yuan has been received so far, a decrease of 3,578,000 yuan. In terms of freight, the budget is 5.8 million tons, but only 4,428,000 tons have been obtained so far. In summary, the current passenger and freight revenue is only 52.5 million yuan, and the budget is 65 million yuan, a sudden decrease of more than 13 million yuan compared to the budget. The above is the decrease in revenue in the nine months. By October, the total decrease in revenue has reached 20 million yuan. It is estimated that the decrease in revenue at the end of the year will exceed 25 million yuan, which is a record unprecedented decrease in revenue for the road. Now, the South Manchurian Railway authorities are not only studying relief measures, but also actively improving various businesses in order to compete with our country. (November 30th)</p>
<h3>Local Correspondence</h3>
<p>Nanhui</p>
<p>Hunan Refugees Escorted Out of County Territory: Yesterday morning, approximately two hundred refugees from Hunan Province, supporting the old and carrying the young, bearing books and burdens, arrived in the city to stay temporarily. Several representatives of the refugees submitted a petition to the county, presenting their passports for verification and requesting the county seal. They also requested travel expenses. The county government, after consideration, provided food allowances and ordered the Public Security Bureau to escort the refugees out of the county immediately. The bureau dispatched six police officers to escort them in the direction of Chuansha.</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>County Magistrate and Chief of the Anti-Banditry Bureau Order Execution of Bandits: County Magistrate and Chief of the Songjiang Anti-Banditry Bureau, Jin Qingzhang, previously received reports from the Joint Defense Office of Songshan Fengjing, composed of Party, government, military, police, and local organizations, and the First Waterborne Public Security Team of Jiangsu Province, regarding the arrest and handover of three individuals from Fengjing: Gu Chunyu, Yu Guixiang, and Fang Ruiyun. After repeated interrogations, they confessed to joining the Communist Party and engaging in kidnapping, robbery, extortion, and fraudulent acquisition of wealth in the Fengjing area, causing unrest among the local residents. Their crimes were indeed unforgivable. They were sentenced to death after approval from the Jiangsu Provincial Government via telegram. Magistrate Jin, on the morning of the fourth, ordered the retrieval of Gu Chunyu and the other two individuals, verified their identities, and had them bound and taken to the Yuhuangge execution ground for execution by firing squad.</p>
<p>Police Officers Seize Suspects: The county government previously dispatched a police team to be stationed in Hougang village. While passing through a certain village, they noticed an individual dressed in Western clothing, carrying a leather bag, approaching leisurely. Upon seeing the police, the individual discarded the bag into the river. Suspecting foul play, the police officers approached to apprehend him. However, the suspect was physically strong. Fortunately, the rear team arrived and, with collective effort, subdued him. They retrieved the leather bag from the river and discovered it contained Communist propaganda materials. It is said that three bandits were also captured in Songjiang and Tinglin at the same time.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Theft from County Government Treasury: It is reported that a treasury, located behind the Wenxi Hall of the county government, is used to store stolen goods from various cases. The other day, the victim of a robbery on Yangmao Bank, Kaiyuan Township, District 14, went to the county to claim the stolen goods but found that several items, including provincial leather robes and fur coats, were missing. A thorough search yielded nothing. Surprisingly, yesterday, when the staff of Datai Silk Shop on North Street prepared a claim form to retrieve the worsted cloth stolen by the thief, it was once again declared missing. Upon hearing this, County Magistrate Pan was enraged and immediately ordered Chief of Political Affairs Police Wu Zhengrong to rigorously pursue and arrest the thieves and recover the stolen goods for legal punishment.</p>
<p>Bandits Arrested in Wuxi: Zhu Niansheng, Chief of the Fourth Public Security Branch outside the West Gate of the county, received a report from Yang Zanchen of Yancheng at 6:00 PM the other day, stating that bandit Sun Tianbao (also known as Yunlong, age 24, from Yancheng), previously served as a soldier in the bandit army of Ma Yuren. On July 17th of this year, he colluded with accomplices Shen Ermazi, Huang Yulong, Zhi Huaibang, and others to kidnap my daughter, Cui Yangshi. Afterwards, the bandits sent a letter to the Cui family demanding a ransom of 600 yuan. Due to the inability to raise the funds, she has not been redeemed to this day. Currently, the bandit Sun Tianbao has brought Cui Yangshi to Wuxi and hidden her in a workshop near Yinglong Bridge outside the West Gate, selling her to Xu Fengyin, a resident of Dongxin Road, as a wife for a price of 110 yuan. He requested immediate dispatch of police to arrest and bring him to justice. After receiving the report, Chief Zhu dispatched police yesterday morning to conduct a surprise arrest at the address, capturing the bandit Tianbao and rescuing the victim, Cui Yangshi.</p>
<p>Both were brought to the bureau.

<p>Successive Cases of Robbery and Assault Occur During Winter Defense: In the current winter defense period, robberies are frequent in the surrounding villages. The family of Weng Qixian, a resident of Jiaqiao, District 20 (Taibo Township), is a modest family with some farmland. The other night, more than ten bandits, speaking with northern accents and wielding knives, sticks, and flashlights, scaled the wall of the Weng residence and broke open the door. All five members of the Weng family, young and old, were tied up and hung. Weng Qixian's mother was stabbed in the thigh with a knife, causing her to bleed profusely. The bandits then overturned chests and boxes, searching and looting at will. All gold and silver jewelry, as well as silk fabrics and clothing, were stolen, with losses estimated at over 2,000 yuan. Furthermore, the Mo Fengsheng Silk Fabric Store in Gedai Bridge, Kaihua Township, District 14, was also invaded by six bandits at 7:00 PM last night. They broke into the store, tied up the owner's wife with ropes, and forced her to reveal the location of the silver. They then robbed her of over 100 yuan in silver.</p>
<p>Continuous Record of Silk Factory Strike: The silk factories in the county suddenly experienced another labor strike on the afternoon of the second, leading to a general strike in all forty-five silk factories in the county. It is now known that on the afternoon of the other day, the Criminal Investigation Team of the Public Security Bureau arrested seven suspects who incited the labor strike: Wang Xiaomei, Wang Pin yuan, Chuan A Ping, Wang Ruhgao, Qin A Jiu, Wang Xiushi, and Bao Wang Cai Bao. They were escorted to the county for interrogation. Subsequently, police officers from the Sixth Public Security Branch continued to apprehend a man named Wang Jingsheng and a woman named Feng Jinmei at the train station, who were sent by Shanghai as representatives to incite the strike. Chief Duan of the branch conducted a preliminary hearing, during which Wang and Feng firmly denied inciting the silk factory labor strike. Based on their statements, Chief Duan presented the case to the county government for investigation. At the same time, Chief of Political Affairs Police Wu Zhengrong of the county government also apprehended Zhang Yifang and Tao Ziming, who were sent to the county for investigation. Hearing Officer Liang opened a court session to investigate.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaomei was released on bail, while the other ten suspects, Wang Pin yuan, Chuan A Ping, Wang Ruhgao, Qin A Jiu, Wang Xiu Bao, Wang Cai Bao, Wang Jingsheng, Feng Jinmei, Zhang Yifang, and Tao Ziming, were temporarily detained pending investigation. In the evening, the Public Security Bureau received a confidential report stating that a small number of workers had formed a team to attend a meeting in Huishan. Upon receiving the report, Chief Xu immediately dispatched Chief Inspector Hu Xinfu and Chief of the Criminal Investigation Team Xue Furui to prevent the meeting from taking place, thus preventing the formation of a new labor strike. After this labor strike, the instruments and items of the four members of the reorganised committee of the Silk Factory Workers' Union, Wang Dongzhu, Li Wujie, Zhang Sanjie, and Zhu Wenxiu, were smashed into pieces, with losses estimated at over 400 yuan. Li and the others have submitted a petition to the County Party Consolidation Committee requesting that it forward the petition to the county government to severely investigate the instigator. Furthermore, the other day, when the Yongtai Silk Factory under Zhizu Bridge outside the South Gate did not completely shut down, a small number of troublemakers entered and smashed part of the factory's glass windows. Chief Wang Weixin of the Third Public Security Branch led police officers to suppress the disturbance, and the situation calmed down. Shortly after, there was also a dispute in front of the Defeng Silk Factory near Jin Hook Bridge. Fortunately, Police Captain Wang Wei led his team to suppress the situation, so no incident occurred. Yesterday (the 4th), all the silk factories still did not resume work. Currently, a mediation and propaganda team organized by Party, government, police, and labor organizations is working hard to mediate between labor and management, but it is unknown whether it can be resolved immediately.

Around 2:00 AM the other night (the 1st), sixty to seventy pirates arrived at Lao Wu City Town East, Dongwu District. At that time, the Fifth Police Squad, which was stationed at the Huoshen Temple there, was sending out sentries. The sentry on the east side suddenly saw two people coming from the opposite side. The sentry immediately questioned them for the password. The two replied that they were ordinary people. The sentry did not suspect anything else and allowed them to pass. As the sentry continued to advance, three bandits suddenly emerged from a pit on the side, intending to seize the police officer's firearms. Fortunately, the police officer was strong and was not disarmed. He then blew his whistle wildly. The police officers gathered together, but the bandits also gathered to resist the police. A fierce battle ensued between the two sides for an hour before the bandits were defeated and retreated. At that time, one of the bandits stabbed a police officer with a small knife. As a result, police officer Hu Wenhua was stabbed in the face. After both sides stopped, the injured police officer was carried back to the team headquarters and transferred to Jishan Hospital in the city for treatment. At the same time, the Public Security Bureau was notified to send a team to the countryside to assist in the suppression of the bandits.</p>

In addition to the representatives from various counties, leaders from Zhenjiang's silver and money industries and various other industries attended the meeting as observers, totaling over 100 people. Each representative had a sincere discussion. They all believed that the national calendar should be observed, and the settlement of accounts is a matter of fact that has a significant impact on the national economy, social security, and public order. Moreover, the circumstances in various regions are different, and the nature of business in various places is also different. If a flexible solution is not sought, it will inevitably affect the whole situation. After a long discussion, it was finally decided that each region should use the end of the national calendar year as the official closing date. If there are outstanding payments, please settle them. If, in reality, there are obstacles and it is necessary to follow the government's method of collecting silver, with a first deadline, a second deadline, and an extension to three times, then the full amount must be cleared. At the same time, the Qianye Guilds of each county will jointly send a letter to the Shanghai Qianye Guild, stating the difficult circumstances and requesting a flexible solution. They will also ask to inform their colleagues of the agreed upon compromise. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

Team Leader Yu Dasheng was dispatched to the original location, and Ruan Kaiji, the county magistrate, has appointed Fang Fengbiao as the acting replacement. It is said that the reason why Zhao Shijie was escorted to the provincial capital was because the county government received a telegram from the Civil Affairs Office stating that Zhao had a significant relationship with the robbery case in Hongfuzhuang, and ordered the county to escort him to the Zhenjiang Court for investigation.</p>
<p>Qingyang Railway Bureau Salary Demand Wave: The Qingyang Railway Bureau is currently experiencing financial difficulties and has laid off many employees in order to maintain management and save costs.

Lu and Liang successively scored, creating a tie of 4-4. After that, Yuehan still maintained the upper hand.

Diao Youdao and Hou Xuemin scored successively, causing Huadong to fall behind. In the first half, Yuehan won with 25 to 17. The battle started again, and the stalemate lasted for a long time. After Yuehan's Chen Xianglong broke the record, Huadong's momentum did not rise. In addition, there were 5 points, but after that, Yuehan showed its power again. Although Huadong was unwilling to show weakness, it was unable to surpass. Yuehan's defense was very tight, making it difficult for the opponent to attack. As a result, Yuehan won 40 to 32.

<h3>West Lake Football Match: Zongwen Wins 4 to 1 Over Anding, Wins Championship</h3>
<p>Watch the Group A Battle on Saturday</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: This city's football championship is divided into Group A and Group B. The Group A championship will be decided this Saturday between the Police Academy and the Institute of Technology. The Group B match between Zongwen and Anding was held at the Hubin Stadium yesterday afternoon. Approximately 2,000 spectators attended. Referee Li Shaoling and inspector Wang Fuxi started the game at 3:15. The players from both teams, with Zongwen taking the upper hand. Anding opened the scoring first, but in less than two minutes, the Zongwen left forward took the opportunity to advance and equalize. Still attacking fiercely, the Anding forward blocked the horse's head, but Zongwen broke through with all its strength and scored another goal. After that, Anding paid attention everywhere, and the center forward drove straight in, but the Zongwen goalkeeper had already ambushed next to him, and there was no chance. In the first half, Zongwen led 2 to 1. After a five-minute break, the teams switched sides and continued the battle. Anding lacked support. Circulating in the Zongwen area, they achieved nothing. The Zongwen left and right guards got people and scored a goal. At this time, Anding's defense line was even more precarious, and it was like a broken bamboo. Zongwen kicked in another goal, so there was no way to save it. As a result, Zongwen won the Group B championship with a score of 4 to 1.</p>
<h3>Record of the Liangjiang Northern Expedition Basketball Team's Victory</h3>
<p>Shao Jiliang, the leader of the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School Northern Expedition basketball team, described the Tianjin and Ping matches. He said that the team set sail north on the Gu Tian Lun on October 19. The ship arrived in Tianjin on the 25th. The sea voyage was originally not supposed to take six or seven days, but the journey was delayed by a day or two due to a slight storm along the way. However, the spirit of the entire team was very strong, and there was no suffering from being unaccustomed to the sea voyage. Upon arriving at the pier, they were welcomed by various Tianjin newspapers, the Sports Federation, and various schools. Nankai University was especially enthusiastic in its reception, and they were taken to the predetermined accommodation at the Young Women's Christian Association. The team originally planned to start the competition the next day, but it was postponed to the 29th because the Tianjin Municipal United Games were held for three days. There were friendship matches in Tianjin with the Women's Normal School, Nankai University, the Women's Teachers University, and the Qunyi team. The details of the victory have been reported in various newspapers, so I will not repeat them here. The team stayed in Tianjin for about a week and had banquets with people from all walks of life. Mr. Zhang Boling, the president of Nankai University, and professors Zhang Jiwu and Dong Shouyi were the closest to the team and provided the most guidance. The team was also very grateful. The organizations in Ping, such as Tsinghua University and the American-organized schools, as well as the Ziqiang and Xingxing teams, which were composed of a mixture of middle schools in Beiping and the athletes from the universities in Beiping, respectively who had won national championships, also participated in friendship matches with the team. They stayed in Ping and also resided at the Young Women's Christian Association. The guidance was cordial, and the chairman of the Sports Federation, Yuan Dunli, and the director of physical education at Tsinghua University, Mr. Ma Bohan, were the most helpful. The team had already boarded the train for the trip to Liaoning, and the Liaoning side had prepared to receive them. However, the trip was cancelled due to the sudden illness of team members Xi Jun and Yu Yunsheng and the extremely cold weather. Even now, the team still regrets this. Since the people of the Tianjin area had not seen the team's battles in Ping, some people went to Ping to watch. Therefore, they detoured back to Tianjin and played two more matches, one with a mixed team from Tianjin Women's Normal University and the other with the Xiaoyang team, which was directed by a former student of the school, Xu He. All the matches were held at the gymnasium of the Kaiqi Mining Bureau. The team received awards from various organizations, including the Tianjin Mayor Jian Qifang, the Sports Association, the Young Men's Christian Association, the Young Women's Christian Association's victory ribbon, Mr. Dong Shouyi's silver shield, and the Kaiqi Mining Bureau's silver medal. Mr. Lu Lihua planned the team's expedition because the atmosphere of women's basketball in Shanghai was declining. The team first planned to travel to Japan, but the Japanese sports organizations sent a letter requesting that the trip be postponed, so the team changed its plans and decided to march north. The enthusiastic support from all circles in North China shows the strength of the promotion of women's basketball in the North.</p>

<h3>Dismissing It with a Laugh</h3>
<p>By Hai Ke</p>
<p>Husband: My dear, I've gotten oil stains on my robe again. Tell Wang Ma to use motor oil to scrub it off for me.</p>
<p>Wife: Forget it, don't make her feel bad again.</p>
<p>Husband: What are you talking about? We pay her to work for us. Can't we ask her to do some odd jobs?</p>
<p>Wife: It's not that. It's just that she fell in love with a chauffeur last year and was madly in love. But in the last two months, the chauffeur has fallen in love with someone else and broke up with her. So, whenever she smells motor oil, she gets sad and cries.</p>
<p>Wealthy woman (taking a walk and encountering rain, seeking shelter in a small shop and casually chatting with the shop assistant): The rain is getting heavier and heavier. It's really annoying.</p>
<p>Shop assistant: Yes, you might as well wait here a little longer.</p>
<p>Wealthy woman: You're usually very busy, but you're much more relaxed today.</p>
<p>Shop assistant: Yes, look at how heavy the rain is. What business is there? Ladies with status don't want to come out.</p>
<p>Girl A (speaking to her fiancé's sister): Sister, the new year is almost here. I want to buy some things to give to your brother.</p>
<p>Girl B: Your brother hasn't given you anything yet. Why do you have to be so polite?</p>
<p>Girl A: But I can't think of anything to buy. You and his sister know his temperament better than I do. What does he like?</p>
<p>Girl B (thinking for a moment and saying with a smile): I think you should give him something that is easy to pawn and easy to sell.</p>
<h3>The Trivial Problem (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhen Duo</p>
<p>— Mr. Yang Xingfo's Lecture —</p>
<p>Last year, Mr. Yang came to Wusong China Public School. He is a school trustee of the China Public School and has been invited by the school several times. According to him, he was dragged here to give a lecture today.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of you have not heard Mr. Yang's lecture in person, but everyone probably knows his reputation as a speaker. So, as soon as Mr. Yang stepped onto the stage, looking at that small mustache on his lips, almost everyone opened their mouths and smiled. He said (the following is omitted): "Today, I want to discuss with you a trivial problem. Look at the situation in Manchuria now. The Japanese are presenting their statistics of disastrous management, comparing them with the number of all their overseas residents. They say that under these circumstances, Manchuria should be occupied by them. This is the case in the international situation, and it is also the case in the eyes of the Japanese. However, we only say that our things should be ours, and we won't give them to you even if they are worse. We don't have any fundamental solutions."</p>
<p>"Looking at the current political and revolutionary phenomena, they are as chaotic as anything. So everyone is saying that there is no solution for China, and we are just waiting to perish as a nation. Pessimism and a pessimistic outlook on life can be said to be extremely prevalent. Then we ask why China is not doing well, and they will say that the people in charge are not good and cannot handle things. Then, if we ask why they are not good, why don't you come up with some solutions? They will definitely say that the environment is not good. Then let's think about who created this environment? It is the current civil strife and political phenomena, which are temporary. Then what is our trivial problem? It is the awakening of our intellectual class. The reason why China has not been doing well for thousands of years is that the world has been made too chaotic by this group of scholars. They believe that studying is superior to everything, and that agriculture, industry, and commerce are for scholars to cultivate and work for. If agriculture, industry, and commerce want to raise their own position, they have to find a way to squeeze themselves into the so-called (scholar) class. Once they enter the (scholar) class, they feel that their status has been elevated a lot. In the past, you saw that the military people could write a few big characters. They thought this was a manifestation of scholars. Those who could not write essays also asked people to write them and signed their own names. This was to show that they were also a (scholar), superior to everything."</p>
<p>"So under this kind of phenomenon, nothing can be done well. Not to mention science, even agriculture, industry, and commerce send their sons to study, thinking that if people want to get ahead, they must study. Think about what kind of phenomenon this is."</p>
<p>"And look at our current international situation. People look at the Chinese as if they are even worse than slaves of a conquered nation. People think it is a disgrace to be with the Chinese. Isn't it the same when Chinese international representatives go to Japan and are insulted when they come back? What has China become in all respects now? This is truly heartbreaking."</p>
<h3>Short Takes</h3>
<p>— Fang Hu</p>
<p>The newly appointed member of the Shaanxi Provincial Government and concurrently Director of the Advisory Hall, Mr. Ben Xie, specialized in hydraulic engineering in Germany. He has detailed plans for the Jing River irrigation project and the Huai River regulation and transportation project in Shaanxi, amounting to hundreds of thousands of words. This time, his appointment means that the Jing River project can be realized, which is enough to comfort his life. In his youth, Li was a classmate with Yang Hucheng and Jing Yuexiu. Li once jokingly said to Jing, "With Li above Jing, I will surely live above you in the future." Jing replied, "It's a pity that the grub has eaten more than half of it." The elegance of the two people can be seen. (However, they rewarded each other.)</p>
<h3>Love Knows No End</h3>
<p>— Gong Yu</p>
<p>There is a Mr. Li near the Wine Affairs Bridge in Shaoxing. His son married Ms. Zhang, nicknamed Meiying, this autumn. Her father, Mr. Zhang, lives in the same town, Shuicheng Village. Both families are in the foil business, and the Zhang family is even a so-called reputable merchant. After only three months, Meiying's belly suddenly bulged high, and her complexion became increasingly sallow. The family thought it was a disease and hired a doctor to prescribe medicine, but to no avail. The doctor knew that she had not been married for long and did not dare to diagnose it as pregnancy. How could they know that things would turn out to be abnormal? One day, Meiying suddenly had severe abdominal pain, and all the symptoms were similar to childbirth. Soon, she gave birth to a baby boy. Looking at the appearance of the child, it was no different from ordinary children, but when held, it was as light as nothing and could be stretched to make it long and shrunk to make it short, as if it were tangible but without substance. The family was horrified and questioned how a fetus could come from only three months. Since it concerned face, Mr. Zhang angrily went to find Meiying's father to reason. Mr. Zhang insisted that his daughter had no immoral behavior in her room. Soon, someone told Zhang, "This is a Yin fetus, a jade from Lantian, and it may not be from the human race." Mr. Zhang was half-convinced and asked his wife to inquire. Meiying was coy and unwilling to tell, and since this matter would hinder her innocence and implicate her old father, she began to describe her strange encounters, and everyone suspected that it was indeed a Yin fetus. However, those who do not believe in ghosts and gods are still unable to explain it. Initially, Meiying was originally betrothed to Zhang, the son of Mr. Zhang, who was young and handsome. Since Meiying was very beautiful and had received a considerable education, although it was arranged by her parents and matchmakers, she really felt satisfied and ecstatic. Others also thought that this pair was truly a perfect match. Zhang's mother was eager to hold her grandson and planned to greet her soon to enjoy the joy of having a grandson. The wedding date had already been selected for this summer. Unexpectedly, Zhang's son was not in good health and, furthermore, was engaged in the business world, calculating and working day and night, and unfortunately contracted tuberculosis. This was still last year's matter. By the spring of this year, he could no longer manage affairs, so he asked for leave to return home, hoping to recover. But who would have thought that since returning home, he had become increasingly ill, and all medicines were ineffective? On the day his illness worsened, he wept and said to his mother, "I am still young and suddenly contracted an incurable disease. My heart is uneasy, and I cannot close my eyes in peace. What I am most concerned about is my fiancée. I have long heard that she is dignified and virtuous and cannot be found elsewhere. I cannot even spend a day with her. Can you discuss with the Zhang family to make her marry my younger brother (note: not a biological brother) so that she can still be a member of my Zhang family?" His mother heard this and wept like rain. She agreed to his wish and asked the original matchmaker to discuss it with Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang refused, saying, "I hope his son will recover from his illness and still be my son-in-law. If there is an accident, he has no right to interfere with my daughter's marriage." The original matchmaker returned and reported to Zhang's son, who wailed loudly and his illness worsened. He also said to his mother, "Although Meiying and I are not married, since she is engaged, she is nominally my wife even if I die. If she can come to my bedside once, then I will have no regrets." He asked his mother to ask the original matchmaker to discuss it with Mr. Zhang. Meiying was quite willing to come and visit, but Mr. Zhang sternly refused, saying, "He is already incurable, so why bother with one more move that would only burden someone else's good daughter? You must know that my daughter's lifelong happiness cannot be sacrificed for him." While Zhang's son was seriously ill, his mind was quite clear. He hoped for good news. When the original matchmaker came and relayed Zhang's words, Zhang's son could not help but cry. He then made a "hehe" sound and said, "There is no affection to this extent, I must repay it." He then died with resentment. Mr. Zhang showed no grief at the death of his son-in-law. Instead, he rejoiced that his daughter had not yet married. Within a month, he returned the engagement money and jade to the Zhang family and demanded the return of the marriage contract to dissolve the relationship. At the same time, someone acted as a matchmaker for his daughter and remarried her to Mr. Li's son. They were married in the autumn. Unexpectedly, Zhang's son did have a spirit after death and often entered Meiying's dreams to enjoy themselves, thus forming a Yin fetus.</p>

The main actors are European superstars Ivan Morujin and his wife, Dangkowa. The film is based on the masterpiece "Rouge et Noir" (Red and Black in English) by the famous French novelist Stendhal (i.e., Marie Hepri Beyle's alias). It is set against the backdrop of the revolution during the reign of King Charles X of France in 1830 and tells the story of an ambitious young man who risks his life and builds many meritorious achievements in the revolutionary party. However, due to the constraints of love, it develops into various tragedies, and the result is that he dies on the battlefield, but not in the love field. This is the best point of the play. As for the depth of expression and the greatness of the background, they are even more insignificant. It is said that the film has been screened at the Paris Grand Theater since Thursday (Yun).</p>

<h3>A Travelogue of the South Seas (91)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>The Burmese respect monks very much. I visited a lawyer and saw a monk in yellow robes arrive. All the seated people stood up, and the monk sat alone. According to custom, people in white clothes cannot sit with people in yellow robes. However, this is not counted in streetcars. Usually, when speaking to a monk, you must call him "Master." Food is also offered with respect. Every morning, households must reserve offerings for the monk's meals. Some say that monks do not beg for food, and people do not dare to eat before offering food to the monks. I dare not believe this, but their monks are already everywhere after dawn and will not be late.</p>
<p>At first, I heard people say that there were no nuns in Burma, but later I learned that this was not the case. There are also quite a few nuns. Their clothes are a lighter shade of yellow than the male monks. Their begging method is different from that of the male monks. Male monks are fed, while nuns beg for rice once every seven days. I think this can prove the laziness of men, who must wait for people to be familiar with them before eating, while women beg for rice and cook it themselves. It is said that Siamese nuns once held an equal clothing color movement, where the color of the nuns' clothes was the same as that of the monks. As a result, the old school opposed it and failed. The system of monks being superior to nuns still exists. Usually, women dare not approach monks. Ten years ago, they had to be several feet away to show respect. Now, this has gradually changed. However, when Burmese people pass in front of monks, they still bow and bend over as usual to show respect. Buddhist countries are truly peaceful.</p>
<p>On the 8th, Lin Baohua obtained a stone tablet from Myanmar and China with a calligraphy post. The three large characters "Weiyuan Camp" were written in high style. On both sides, it was written: "The Great Ming General Who Pacifies the West, Liu ( ) built an altar and vowed to the public here, vowing that the six Comforting Offices will be opened, the three Pacifying Offices will be restored, all foreign tribes will sincerely offer tribute forever, wash their armor in the Jinsha River, hide their knives in the rabbit cave, neither let go nor capture, the southern people will submit themselves. 受誓孟養宣慰司木邦宣慰司孟密安撫司隴川宣撫司萬歷十三年月日刻石云" [Received vows from Mengyang Comforting Office, Mubang Comforting Office, Mengmi Pacifying Office, Longchuan Pacifying Office. Engraved in the 13th year of Wanli.]</p>
<h3>Correspondences from a European Tour (87)</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Pilgrimage to Italy Diary</p>
<p>(3) Ten Days in Rome (10)</p>
<p>Day 3 - Trajan's Column - St. Peter's Basilica</p>
<p>My tour of the streets of Rome originally aimed to discover the reasons why Rome became the eternal city. Therefore, the interest in touring the streets is not in the broad and bustling streets, but in the secluded ruins, rubble, and broken steles. This is not only because of its charming ancient color, but also because these ruins and broken steles are adorned with relief sculptures, from which one can still see the legends and stories of the past.</p>
<p>From our residence, we walked past the station on the stone road shimmering in the sunlight for about ten minutes to Trajan's Column Square. In the center of this large square stands a huge marble column, 147 feet high, towering into the azure sky, showing an extraordinary solemnity and greatness.</p>
<p>The peace and glory of Emperor Trajan can be seen from the column erected in this public square. This column is the best preserved of all the memorial monuments in the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>The lower part of the column is a stone room containing the ashes of Emperor Trajan. The column is erected on a small hill surrounded by a public square, and the walls of the square are also decorated with reliefs. These reliefs are not comparable to the upper reliefs of the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus, nor to the reliefs around the altars of Olympia and Delphi. The column erected above the stone room of Trajan's relief is 43 meters high, truly a great building. Below this stone column is an exquisite and seamless stone room combined of 23 pieces of marble.</p>
<p>The stories on the column's reliefs number no less than 125, with a total of 2,500 figures. They are extremely detailed, from the beginning of passing through the Danube to the fall of the Daces capital, Sarmzegethusa, and the suicide of the barbarian king Decebalus. The sculptures not only focus on depicting battles, but also vividly depict the scenes of passing through the rocks and forests of the Carpathians. The clothing of those objects is especially valuable material for archaeologists. The shapes and costumes of the Danubians are completely different from those of the Romans. Even the Greek art of the Alexandrian era did not have such a realistic attitude. It is true that many Greek sculptors were used at the time of building this column, but these sculptors were inspired by Rome to complete this great achievement that will last for centuries.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of Trajan's Column, this kind of historical monument has gradually become a traditional art in Rome. The art that occurred in the Italian Renaissance in later centuries also originated from this. Only such art, so vivid, so novel, so rich, can give mankind eternal comfort.</p>

<h3>Fierce Bull Market Reappears in Financial Gold Market</h3>
<p>The state is excellent. Yesterday, December 4, the gold bidding showed a peak trend again. The momentum was so rapid that it was no less than a small drop and a large recovery. It only ended with a balance of one or two taels. There were a total of six taels throughout the day. Looking back, the state was excellent. Yuanheng, Yuanmao, Yongda, Decheng, and Dalian Gang all had purchases in the early market. Yongfeng, Fuyu, Fuxingyong, etc. had all sold out. However, all firms did not have large amounts of deposits and withdrawals. The overseas silver market only rebounded with large bars, and the silver price did not move, so people's hearts were firm. The gold price immediately broke through the 600 tael mark, and because the exchange rate was also showing. The listed price did not move, and the gold market will see further progress in the future. However, it rose to more than three taels, but it sometimes rose and fell, hovering around 602 taels. The market was peaceful. In the later market, buyers were crowded. Yongfeng, Decheng, Yuanmao, Yongyuanheng, etc. all competed to buy. The Indian exchange rate reported low, and the exchange rate was even more tense. The industry frantically dug in, so the market was extremely sharp, and there was almost a leap of a thousand feet. The soaring four taels reappeared with a new peak of 606 taels and seven cents. According to those in the industry, the hope of 610 taels or more is foreseeable. This morning, the large bar silver should have a rebound.</p>
<p>The early market was booming. The opening of the January gold bidding was 600 taels and nine cents, an increase of one tael and nine cents (the gross market was initially more than 599 taels to more than 607 taels). This was because although the large bar rose by one-eighth, the US silver did not change to stimulate it. Furthermore, the private telegram went down by one-sixteenth. Subsequently, Yongheng, Zhifengyong, etc. had all taken action and entered, and the British gold immediately showed strength. HSBC absorbed 1.65625 taels in December, and Mitsui absorbed Dalian taels, 1.3 cents and 1.5 cents to 1.75 cents. The gold price continued to rise by 2.0 taels, reaching 603 taels and 3 cents. Subsequently, Yongfeng, etc. sold out, so the initial announcement was 2.3 cents. The listed price did not move, calculated as 2.56 cents, and the domestic market was stable. Citibank issued 37.625 yuan for February US dollars, which was absorbed by the silver company. Furthermore, HSBC bought British gold 1.65625 taels with China and Belgium in December. On the table, Fuxingyong, etc. sold out, so it fell by 1.0 taels to 1.4 cents at 10 o'clock. Subsequently, Neixing, Yuanxingyong, etc. came in, and the industry continued to tie up British gold. Shanghai issued 1.65625 taels in January, and Hefeng issued 1.6625 taels in March. The gold price was back on the table at 1.5 taels. Around 11 o'clock, it was 2.9 cents. In an instant, it seemed that there were many short positions sold in the market and they had already returned 1.0 taels, calculated as 1.7 cents. Afterwards, Taiwan, etc. bought spot goods</p>
<p>Dalian was one tael, three cents, and 1.9375 cents. It was estimated that the recent British gold would be settled at 6 pm in the first half of March at 1.65625 taels. Retail investors also had purchases. At 11:30, it was estimated that 2.7 cents. Afterwards, the market seemed to be divergent, with ups and downs of about 5 or 6 cents, reaching over 2.1 cents. At the noon closing, it was 2.5 cents. Afterwards, it was slightly suppressed by 1 or 2 cents. Items were pressed for 1 cent. The revealed price was estimated at 643 taels and 8 cents, estimated at 41 or 12 taels. In the afternoon, the market could not be stopped. The opening of the afternoon market was 602 taels and 3 cents, and it immediately rose because the Indian exchange rate was small by two anna. Yongfeng, etc. first bought in, estimated to have risen by 4.2 cents. In a moment, it was reduced by 7 or 8 cents. It was estimated that the British gold in March and April was being tied up by the industry. However, the bank was still willing to supply it, such as McGary, East Asia, Shanghai, etc. issued 1.65625 taels. At 2:40, a sudden flight emerged because it was learned that the Indian exchange rate continued to be low and the British gold was particularly sharp. Shanghai issued 1.6 to McGary in March and issued 37.4175 yuan in January in US dollars, and December 3125. Yuanheng Dadongcheng, Yuanmaoyongheng, Yuheng, etc. bought in with courageous momentum, estimated to have risen by 2.0 cents. After 3 o'clock, it reached 5.7 cents, and retail investors sold out and immediately retreated to 4.7 cents. In a moment, Yuanmaoyong, Yuantai Zhifengyong, etc. continued to compete to enter, so the shorts were greatly affected and had to make up for it. Especially the British gold, the Chinese bank sold 1.6 to Mitsui in April, and Mitsui issued 4375 taels in January. Mitsui appeared in Dalian as one tael, three cents, and 3.125 cents. The Datong and Sumitomo mutually traded British gold 1.64175 taels in March, so the gold price was unparalleled. The restoration jumped by 2.4 cents and soared to 4.7 cents. Items also came to chase in. However, the Dalian Gang took this opportunity to sell out, so it depreciated by more than one tael, estimated to be 5.23 cents. However, the buyers were not tired. When the market closed at 4:30, it rose again to 606 and a half taels, a rebound of 7.5 taels compared to the day before yesterday. The maximum price of the day was 606 taels and 7 cents, and the minimum price was 600 taels and 9 cents, with a difference of 5.8 cents. The early market for goods was 600 taels and 8 cents, the noon closing was 2.4 cents, the afternoon was 2.4 cents, and the closing was 6.8 cents, which was 3 cents higher than the Bund. The revealed price was estimated to be 41 to 37 taels, with 606 to 3 taels recorded, and the supplementary water was 606 taels, 610 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>There was a sudden increase in trading accounts. The industry trading generally sought to exceed supply, but there was no very large amount of capital, so there were not many chips. It was estimated that Dadongcheng, Yuanmaoyong, Yuanhengyongheng, Yuanxingyong, Shunli, and Bingxing all entered. Zhifengyong and Wanxing had mixed ins and outs. Yongfeng, Fuyu, Yuda, and Fuxingyong all sold out. In the afternoon, Yongfeng, Yuanheng, Yuantai, Dadongcheng, Zhifengyong, and Yuanmaoyong all entered. Wanxing, Shunli, Taikangrun, Hengyu, etc. sometimes entered and sometimes exited. Taichang, Fuchang, and exchange rate hedging, etc. sold out. Items came to buy. The Dalian Gang entered a total of 1,600 bars and exited 1,400 to 500 bars. The Guangdong Gang still belonged to the eastern hand.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange is Exceptionally Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market rebounded slightly, but the silver price did not change, so the market was stable. The exchange rate rose and fell slightly. The HSBC listed price did not change. However, the domestic market within the bank was extremely tight. The gold market also saw a peak and exceeded the 600 tael mark again, appearing at a new high price of 606 taels and 7 cents. This was actually related to the unchanging price of green silver and there was a shrinking trend. People's hearts were unusually high. Huashang Yufeng, Yongrun, Changyu, Hongli, etc. frantically dug in and purchased 300,000 pounds of British gold in the front and back markets, still occupying a short position and had not yet met the demand for a while. The bank's real intention was not slack. East Asia, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Xingye, Hefeng, Huabi, McGary, Mitsui, etc. all sold out. The various banks mutually traded more than 100,000 pounds and jointly made 200,000 to 300,000 yuan in US dollars. The Japanese exchange transaction was limited, only showing the Dalian ticket. The Dalian Gang had sold more than 1 million yuan to Mitsui Sumitomo Taiwan, etc. in the early market. However, it was slightly settled in the afternoon, and Mitsui San sold it. The market atmosphere was quite auspicious. It was heard that a certain bank received a foreign telegram that the discount rates were likely to shrink again. As a result, each exchange rate was lower than the previous day, with British gold shrinking by 25, US dollars shrinking by half a yuan, and Japanese gold rising by 1.625 cents.</p>
<p>The British exchange domestic market had ups and downs of 1.875. In the morning, the December price was 1 shilling, 6 pence, 5625, and the buying price was 625. The March price was 625, and the buying price was 6875. East Asia issued and HSBC entered 10,000 pounds at a price of 5625 in December. East Asia issued 5,000 at a price of 625 in April.

<h3>Large Bars Increase by 125 in Near and Far Terms</h3>
<p>According to the London telegram yesterday, the large bar silver suddenly turned back, which was a reversal in the midst of the continuous tragic decline. The recent term rebounded by 125 to 16 pence and 1875 (equivalent to 1 shilling, 7 pence, and 125 in British gold). The forward term also increased by 125, calculated as 16 pence and 125. China and India both had purchases. There were still sellers selling out. The market was stable. The United States did not have much activity after the market closed. The US silver price did not change. The spot price was 34.75 cents. The British to US dollar depreciated by 0625 to 4.8553125 yuan. The US to British dollar did not change and was still calculated as 4.8559375 yuan. The Japanese to US dollar was still 49.625 yuan. The British to Japanese dollar was calculated as 2 shillings and 053125. The British to Shanghai shilling increased by 25 to 7 pence and 125. The Mumbai spot price depreciated by one anna, calculated as 46 rupees and 09 anna. Furthermore, Reuters and the Electrical Communication Agency did not change the price, which is omitted.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollar Status During the Closing Period</h3>
<p>This year, the silver money industry followed the order of the national government to close accounts according to the Gregorian calendar, so all procedures must be prepared in advance. However, the matter is innovative, and the response is quite difficult. Therefore, we are extra cautious in lending and must also consider the difficulties on the debt side. If we have to consider both, it seems that a flexible approach is not possible. Therefore, the current business news, in addition to a lot of collection news, is really lacking important events to record.</p>
<p>The prime discount rate fluctuates (foreign prime). The market heart was slightly firm in the morning, and the closing price was high by 0.25 cents, at 7 cents, 2 minutes, and 4.5 cents. The noon market was even more vivid, and the market price was raised by 0.5 cents, at 7 cents, 2 minutes, and 5 cents. However, there were not many transactions, and the market was not very firm. It is feared that it will still have to fall back within the day. (Silver discount) The early market was 80%, and the noon market was 50%. The head and white lines were listed without a market. The atmosphere of looseness and stagnation reappeared, as in the vacant period last month. It is predicted that the current closing period will only collect and not release, and the head liner will naturally be abundant. It is appropriate that the silver price will not easily rise in color.</p>
<p>The silver dollar entry and exit is slightly complicated (silver money). Yesterday, the bank's collection news felt slightly fragmented. It was estimated that the Chinese merchants collected and delivered 260 to 700,000, and the foreign merchants collected and delivered 210,000. The exchange tax sundries collected and delivered 960 to 700,000, and the settlement collected and delivered still had more than 40,000 remaining, and there was also more than 200,000 in special money. 1.4 million was released from the warehouse. The Japanese merchants collected and delivered various money totaling 440,000, and the settlement collected and delivered 150 to 600,000, with 800,000 released from the warehouse. The money banks and silver guild jointly collected and delivered more than 44.4 million and collected and delivered more than 5.2 million in line money. Various routes of remittance money collected and delivered more than 1.2 million and collected 200,000 in cash. (Foreign money) The exchange line money made 1.555 million in the early market and 765,000 in the noon market. The banknotes made 5,000 in the early market and 20,000 in the noon market. The off-site banknotes made 215,000 in the early market and 120,000 in the noon market. The bank transactions made 600,000 in the mutual market in the early market and 500,000 in the mutual market in the noon market. Various banks' foreign accounts received and delivered more than 1.72 million and recovered and issued 260 to 700,000 in banknotes. The money banks and foreign guild jointly collected and delivered more than 6.4 million and collected and delivered more than 2.3 million in foreign line money. The foreign money borrowing was more than 1.7 million, and the small money bank transactions were 8 to 900,000. The source of the customer route was more than 300,000, and nothing was heard about the stomach.</p>
<h3>The Phenomenon of Fluctuations in Subsidiary Currency</h3>
<p>New Price Reappears for Four-Cash Coins: Six Maces, Five Cents, Seven Lis and a Half</p>
<p>Eight-Cash Coins Fall by Three Lis: Copper Coins Rebound by 500 Cash</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, it was reported that a large quantity of silver fractional currency was arriving in Shanghai from other ports, which calmed the market. Consequently, Guangdong small silver coins slightly fell by one li in early trading, reaching six maces, five cents, and five lis and a half. However, buying interest picked up again in the afternoon, but the supply remained insufficient, leading to a renewed increase above the previous morning's high, reaching six maces, five cents, and seven lis and a half, a new high not seen this year. As for Jiangsu small silver coins, due to weak sales and a lack of supply, there were no problems. Therefore, the price remained at six maces, six cents, and one li in both the morning and afternoon sessions, a decrease of three lis compared to the afternoon session of the previous day. Trading volume for Guangdong fractional currency was 85,000 coins in the morning and 20,000 coins in the afternoon. For Jiangsu fractional currency, there were 3,000 coins traded in the morning, with no trading in the afternoon. The streetcar company supplied copper coins in abundance, so there was no fear of scarcity. Therefore, the market rebounded by 500 cash yesterday to 373,500 cash. However, judging by the overall trend, the momentum is still shrinking, and it is possible that the market will shrink into the 70,000 cash range.</p>
<p>Slight Drop in Securities and Bond Prices, Trend Becomes More Stable</p>
<p>Although various government bonds were actively traded in the spot market yesterday, the "zero-week" market remained lively. The trading volume was over 4.8 million in the morning and 6.6 million in the afternoon. Yesterday, the supply and demand for various bonds were relatively balanced, and the trend was more stable than before. However, the selling pressure was slightly stronger than before, and the price decline was mostly only around two or three cents. Only the "96 Financial 19 Rolls" slightly rebounded, and the "Aftermath Small Notes" spot market, which has not been traded for a long time, rose by more than six yuan compared to late August. The total spot trading volume for the day was 35,000 yuan, while the futures trading volume still reached over 11.4 million.</p>

<p>Weak Real Demand for Yarn and Cotton, Yarn Market Difficult to Revive</p>
<p>The yarn market has slightly stabilized. The overseas situation for cotton yarn is uniformly trending downward. Demand for yarn in the Shanghai market is extremely weak, and various sectors are lifeless. This is mainly due to the approaching end of the year and the tight credit conditions, which are weakening purchasing power. Therefore, although some manufacturers are maintaining purchases in recent months, the overall trend is difficult to reverse, and the situation is difficult to be optimistic.</p>
<p>Man-Marked Cotton Futures Market is Firm in the Near Term, Weak in the Far Term</p>
<p>The man-marked cotton futures market opened with a significant drop in American and Indian cotton, causing market sentiment to weaken, with each falling by 3.5 maces. Later, due to a certain factory taking delivery in the current month, the market became slightly firmer, resulting in each falling by 1.4, 7, and 8 maces. In the afternoon, retail investors heard that the factory was maintaining the near-month contracts and that sellers were relatively scarce, tightening the market. Near-month contracts rose by 3.4 maces, while far-month contracts rose by 1.2 maces. The total trading volume for the day was 19,400 bales. It was found that Ruida sold 3,100 bales, Xinhua 1,200 bales, and the rest 300, 400, and 500 bales. Gongtai bought 1,500 bales, Tiancheng 1,400 bales, Yongfeng 850 bales, and the rest 500, 600, and 800 bales. The closing prices for the man-marked cotton futures market are recorded below:</p>

<p>March 14,447 Down 6,255,50</p>
<p>December 14,10 Up 3,247,00 April 14,569,167,50</p>

<p>February 14,333,329,55</p>
<p>Weak Sales of Spot Yarn</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are becoming increasingly sluggish. Statistics for the entire day show that various sectors purchased only 340 bales, with local dealers taking in 30 bales. Japanese yarn prices fell by one or two taels. In addition, foreign dealers imported 125 bales from the mainland, 45 bales from Shantou, 60 bales from Jiangxi, 20 bales from Wuhu, 40 bales from Tianjin, and 50 bales from miscellaneous sources.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Under Strong Pressure from Foreign Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending downward as both American and Indian cotton prices have fallen significantly. However, a portion of the market is difficult to become active because bandits are disturbing the outskirts of Hankou, making it difficult to transport cotton smoothly. The supply is scarce, and prices remain firm. However, both domestic and foreign factories in the market have stopped purchasing cotton. Indian cotton prices are even cheaper by one or two taels compared to before, so Chaozhou merchants continue to sell short. Considering foreign cotton, there is still a risk of further price declines in the future.</p>
<p>Hankou Cotton is Being Heavily Sold, English Cotton</p>
<p>The Hankou cotton market opened with weak sentiment due to the drop in foreign cotton prices. Retail investors sold, and prices fell by two or three maces each. In the afternoon, the market remained weak, falling by another five cents. The total trading volume for the day was 55,500 dan. It was found that Yicheng sold 5,300 dan, Shenxin 2,300 dan, and the rest 1,400, 500, 600, and 700 dan. Shenchang bought 3,500 dan, Hengyi 2,900 dan, and the rest 1,800 and 900 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>February 31,353,013,05 00</p>
<p>Cotton Sales Become Increasingly Scarce</p>
<p>Spot cotton is becoming increasingly desolate. Factories are not taking any action. The supply includes 1,200 bales of Yao cotton and 170 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<h3>Overseas Yarn and Cotton Prices Show Another Downturn</h3>
<p>Liverpool Merchants Dump American Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices were affected by unfavorable news from Liverpool. Liverpool merchants dumped their holdings, and the spot market was quiet and weak.

<p>Grain and Rice Market Firm and Quiet Due to Rain</p>
<p>The arrival of ships from various sectors at Zhabei yesterday was slightly sparse, and sales in the market remained stagnant. However, due to the continuous rain, it was difficult to unload the river rice, so buyers and sellers took a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<p>Trading in high-grade white rice was extremely quiet, and prices turned firm. Special top-grade rice needs to be above 14 yuan. The early rice market was quiet with little fluctuation, but sellers were slightly increasing prices. Both Yangdujian and the guest port rice felt slightly tight, but although there were transactions in the market, the rice was not moved. The situation for Tonghao Jiao, which is permitted to be exchanged for silver yuan, remained the same. The top-grade exchange opened at 13 yuan and 7 jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday in Shanghai South, over ten ships arrived. The purchase interest for common rice from Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou and Tongzhou increased because of the rain that pushed up the price by 1 jiao. The early south rice was initially stagnant, but soon due to the continuous decline, customer interest began to move, and it rose accordingly. The market shape for Yangjian and Dujian, with retail sales, was better than for rice, with a corner to corner and a half increase. Although the arrival of white yuan was slightly less, the stock remained high, so the price only increased by 1 jiao in the purchase. The trading volume in each store was not much, because most of the stores had not been to the market, but the retail interest was refreshing, and the price was tightened by the rain, but the number of corners was few.</p>
<h3>The Guest Xian Rice Follows the Dumi and Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of the guest xian rice was stabilized because the arrival of the Hepu Dumi was greatly reduced, and the households on this street paid attention to the market, and the market immediately became active, and the price also changed to a stable trend. However, the guest gangs were hindered by the end of the year problem, and they have not started for many days. Only this gang on the street asked about it, and there were Dujing and Duxian, which made the price of the guest xian rice not easy to increase. Yesterday, the total market traded more than 100 bags of Jiangxi Jizao, priced at 10 yuan and 2 jiao, and 120 bags of Jiwan, priced at 11 yuan and 5 cents. 100 bags of Hunan Ji oil were priced at 10 yuan and 8 jiao and a half, and 300 bags of Nanjing Ji rice were priced at 10 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>This Month's Flour High Jumps 3 Points Strongly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the markets in each month showed a consistent trend of rising. The origin of this rise is entirely based on facts, not the so-called speculation. The overseas atmosphere is still not good, but in this port, the standard is gradually declining. It seems that there is a concept of not being worth money. The manufacturers' spot goods must be about 2 cents. Everyone who purchases the standard holds the standard, even if it is small, they uniformly collect spot goods to meet the future sales. (It is heard that the Nanyang gang has handled 10,000 bags of spot flour, priced at 2 taels and 2 cents.) The so-called suffering for a while can still be compensated for in the sale of spot goods after delivery. For this reason, the buying interest of people in the industry is strong, and the short sellers outside the industry also see the opportunity to make up for it. The market atmosphere in each month is rising. As a result, this month's closing price rose by 3 points and 2 and a half cents compared with the previous day, January by 2 cents and 7 and a half cents, February by 2 cents and 2 and a half cents, March by 2 and a half cents, April by 2 cents and 5 cents, and May by 2 cents and 5 cents.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Market Turned to Rising Momentum in the Evening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market in each month showed an initial flat followed by a quick trend. At the beginning, the price of foreign wheat was reported to be 2 or 3 jiao lower, so the market atmosphere was still flat. Then, the wheat from the household was seen to be scarce, and the market showed stability. In the afternoon, because the flour market on this street and the actual sales for the purchase were smooth, the price also became lively. The long-silent people's hearts were also carried up. In addition, the large short sellers intended to preemptively make up for the loss, so the opening price of each month also became more expensive. According to the flour sales, the wheat market may follow the lead, but it is difficult to change the situation. The bottom line is that there is no hope for improvement. As a result, the trend for both this month and February was 6 cents better than the previous day, March and April were 5 cents better, and May was 4 cents better. The factory wheat was very tired, and no delivery was seen.</p>
<p>The Sugar Market, Ice Flower and Green Market, Are Still Selling Well</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's production area telegraph: The current price of Cuban sugar is still 1.40625. The New York futures sugar price is 1.29 in December, 1.38 in March next year, 1.48 in May, and 1.59 in September. Compared with the previous telegram, only the March price fell by 4 cents, and the rest of the months fell by 3 cents. The current price of Javanese sugar is 7.875, and the futures sugar price is 8 shield in January and 8.125 in February, with no increase or decrease compared to the previous one. The association market divided the plate, and the buying interest in the 24th grade of Dutch coarse sugar was very small. The transaction price was still 7 taels, 7 cents, and 2 and a half. Although there was no significant downward trend, the market shape was weak. The 20th grade of medium sugar white 7 taels and 8 cents and a half and finely ground sugar white 7 taels and 8 cents were also needed. The transaction of Japanese sugar was also weak. Z marks called 8 taels, YT marks called 7 taels and 9 cents, and there were few inquiries. YRO marks were 7 taels, 3 cents, and a half. YP marks were 8 taels and 3 cents, and YM marks were 7 taels, 4 cents, and 7 and a half cents to 7 taels, 4 cents, and 6 cents and 2 lis and a half. The market atmosphere was also flat. The number of ice flowers opened in the plate was 150 bags, priced at 1 yuan, 7 taels, and 1 and a half cents, and the market was still selling well.</p>
<p>North-South Goods, Jianqu is Rare and Speculative</p>
<p>Land Price 70 Yuan: Shanghai Sales 54 Taels</p>
<p>Hongqu is best produced in Fuzhou, named Jianqu. Recently, the land has been very scarce. The price has risen to 70 yuan, but there are still no takers. There is not much stock here, and the price must be 54 taels. The second is Chaoqu, and the upper village also needs more than 30. The middle village is 212 taels. The bottom of the line has more stock, only selling for around 18 taels. Most of the current sales are retail transactions, and Jianqu is the most sold.</p>
<p>Seafood Dried Scallops, All Firms Tighten Together</p>
<p>Dried scallops have been selling well recently in this street and in the inland gangs. The goods that arrived earlier have been exhausted, and it is heard that the production market has risen by 5 yuan, and the cost must be increased, so the stocks in the hands of the firms are tightened for sale. The market is therefore turning firm. Yesterday, the firm's disc: The medium-sized Xinguang goods were 170 taels, the large-sized goods were 166 taels and 3 jiao, the triangular goods were 135 taels to 132 taels, the broken materials of fresh color were 138 taels, the bad color was 125 taels, the Aomori was 135 taels, the Yantai goods were 130 taels, and the small-sized goods were 115 taels. All the stores were short of goods. If there are no follow-up goods to supply, there is a risk of stock-outs.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea Sichuan Silk, the Source is Gradually Scarce</p>
<p>Every winter, the water level of the Upper River must be shallow, and the shipping is difficult. The shipping companies feel that they will actually increase the shipping fee for import and export goods to make up for it. This year, the shipping fee on the Upper River was first increased on the first of this month. The Sichuan silk merchants shipped the stored silk in batches to Shanghai before the deadline. Therefore, the amount of Sichuan silk transported to Shanghai in the middle of last month increased. Recently, the amount of silk stored in the production area has been thin. The shipping fee has been increased, and the source of Sichuan silk has gradually become scarce.</p>
<h3>Gongxi Tea, Russian Sales Turned Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market continued to show a decline. Russian tea houses have turned weak in their interest in Gongxi green tea recently, and it is heard that there will be a suspension of sales next week. However, the actual operation of tea by Russian tea houses is controlled by the head office. In this time of expensive gold and cheap silver, Japanese tea is more expensive than Chinese tea, and it seems difficult to confirm whether sales will be suspended. Only the Zhenmei item has suffered a major blockage in Morocco, and the Shanghai market has slumped. The future is very worrying. The stocks of other items such as Zhenmei and Pearl Tea are thin, and it seems that there is no major impact on the market.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance's Plan to Consolidate Domestic and Foreign Debt</h3>
<p>Using the New Customs Surplus to Fully Fund the Consolidation Fund</p>
<p>The Nationally Determined New Tariff Rules Cannot Be Announced</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's consolidation of domestic and foreign debt, the foreign debt part is being carried out separately to various countries, and the domestic debt part is only waiting for the establishment of the domestic debt creditor group to be able to connect and carry out. Now that the creditor group has been established, the consolidation is not far away. The information obtained will be recorded below.</p>
<p>The consolidation plan of the Ministry of Finance is to consolidate domestic and foreign debt for a period of 30 years, which has been recorded in the previous report. It is heard that the consolidation method will issue a type of consolidation bonds because the nationally determined new tariff rules are about to be announced, and the fund for issuing the bonds is to extract a part of the new customs surplus after the announcement of the new tariff rules to fully fund the consolidation. According to the world's set tariff income, it increases year by year, so the Ministry of Finance plans to increase the allocation of this fund year by year. It is estimated that the domestic and foreign debt can be fully repaid in 30 years. It is heard that 5 million will be allocated in the first year.</p>
<p>Domestic Debt Creditor Group The domestic debt creditor group has been established and has appointed Zhang Gongquan and five others as representatives to prepare to contact the Ministry of Finance. The office is heard to be located in the Shanghai Banking Association to facilitate the contact. This is a permanent agency. In the future, all debt affairs can be handled by the agency representative. The expenses have been determined to be paid by various banks. Once the domestic debt consolidation method is determined, the expenses can be without worry. It is also heard that a person who is proficient in handling domestic debt in the former Beiping government's Ministry of Finance will be hired to preside over everything with pay.</p>
<h3>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Fails to Pay Interest on the Loan</h3>
<p>Ministry Official Explains the Reason</p>
<p>Purely Affected by Gold's Value</p>
<p>Will Not Delay for Too Long</p>
<p>This Tuesday, the "North China Daily News" published that the Beijing-Shanghai Railway's Sino-British Company loan's semi-annual interest was not paid on time. Yesterday, Director Liu of the Ministry of Railways, together with the chief engineer of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, sent a letter to the newspaper explaining the reasons for the delay in payment, so that those holding bonds could understand the truth and dispel doubts. The letter stated that the reason for the delay in payment of interest this time was entirely due to the extraordinary shortage of foreign exchange. Because the purchase of materials and supplies from foreign countries and the interest on loans are calculated using British gold. Last year, the exchange rate was 12 yuan per pound, but now it has risen to 18 yuan, a huge difference. The construction of this road has exceeded 26 years, and the rails and sleepers must be gradually replaced, and vehicles must also be added. This payment is paid in English gold, which is a significant loss in exchange. In addition, before the war was over, freight transportation was greatly affected, and daily income decreased by no less than thousands of yuan compared to normal days. Now that the war is over, passenger and freight transportation is rapidly returning to normal, so the interest due will be able to be raised and allocated within a reasonable period of time, and it will not be delayed for too long. It can be guaranteed to those who hold bonds. It is also found that this road also failed to pay interest once in June 1927, but it was quickly reissued. This interest can also be raised and paid quickly like in 1927. It is hoped that those who hold loans do not need to worry too much.</p>
<h3>Jinliyuan Case, French Principal Asks for Too High a Price</h3>
<p>Gao Shuo Refutes Shuo, Replies to Ba and</p>
<p>Proposes Three Reasons</p>
<p>In the Jinliyuan Wharf case, Sandetang has been willing to sell and asked for 390,000 from the China Merchants Bureau, but the China Merchants Bureau followed the Ministry of Public Works' Category A land valuation of no more than 110,000 taels, and the difference was too large to be resolved satisfactorily. Gao Shuo, the lawyer representing the China Merchants Bureau, recently sent a letter to lawyer Ba, refuting the matter based on facts. It is heard that French Consul General Gan Gelin convened a meeting on the morning of the 2nd for this matter and asked lawyer Gao Shuo to immediately submit a written opinion for adjudication in order to mediate. The original letter issued by lawyer Gao is recorded below:</p>
<p>Respectfully, the management of the National Government's China Merchants Bureau has issued to the law firm your letter of November 3 this year, representing Sandetang, willing to transfer the deed of land, Aizi No. 69, to the China Merchants Bureau, clarifying the four items of the target object A, B, C, and D, and various conditions. Your law firm replied to your law firm on the 13th of the same month, informing Sandetang to check. Now, after considering the request, the China Merchants Bureau believes that items B and D, the wharfs, historically belonged to the China Merchants Bureau, and they have filled them in with a huge amount of 600,000 taels, which is a solid right and does not need to be purchased separately. The right to increase taxes on the land of item C, not only does the National Government's Ministry of Finance's regulation on managing Shatin not recognize the example of parent and child being born, but the regulations of the former Qing Ministry of Households also stipulated that no matter whether the parent and child are born or the center of the river suddenly rises, it all belongs to the public. The naturally rising beaches along the river and along the coast all belong to the scope of state-owned land. Your client should not regard it as an existing right. Only the base of item A, one mu, one fen, six li, seven hao, six, can be discussed. However, on what basis can your client ask for a price of 290,000 taels for the above land price? The China Merchants Bureau is very willing for your client to clearly answer this point. The other second, third, and fourth articles are all conditions attached to the first article, land A. If purchased, it will not be difficult to negotiate at any time. However, the firm must solemnly declare that on the morning of the 19th of this month at 11 o'clock, the deed issued by Shanghai Daotai Yan in the fifteenth year of Guangxu was personally seen at your client's Xiaolou Father's place, stating that the land should be leased to the China Merchants Bureau for use and should not be leased to others. If it is leased to others, this deed will be used as waste paper. This is the ironclad evidence that the China Merchants Bureau has the permanent lease right to the land and that your client cannot make a decision. For the sake of reconciliation, the China Merchants Bureau wants to purchase the land in good faith, which is an extraordinary accommodation. Your client cannot deliberately raise the price for speculation. The reason (1) The China Merchants Bureau is now ordered by the National Government to be incorporated into the state-owned enterprise and is a department directly under the National Government. It is an official nature. In this office's Land Law promulgated on June 30, Articles 335 and 336, Article 4, the needs of the state's transportation undertakings may requisition private land. Just as the Ministry of Public Works builds roads, it can use private land at any time, and no one can resist. Now the China Merchants Bureau does not directly use the qualifications of an official office to requisition according to law, but first purchases the land through friendly negotiation, which is very considerate to the church. Your client cannot deliberately raise the price for speculation. The reason (2) In short, the only fair and credible standard for land prices in Shanghai is the valuation of the Ministry of Public Works. According to the Ministry of Public Works' pricing of Aizi No. 69, it is only worth 128,436 taels. If you understand the meaning, the Chamber of Commerce can use this as a calculation standard. If your client can understand the above reasons, please reply and then discuss other articles. This letter is sent to your client for review and reply. This is respectfully addressed to lawyer Ba and lawyer Gao Ke, representing the law firm.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Prepares to Deal with Water Shut-off</h3>
<p>Immediately Convening a Meeting of Representatives</p>
<p>Adopting the Most Effective Methods</p>
<p>The "New Voice Society" reports that the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, following the decision made at the representatives' meeting the day before yesterday to reject the water rate increase proposal based on the report reviewing the Shanghai Waterworks Company's accounts, has decided to hand over the enforcement measures to the Executive Committee for discussion. It is also reported that the Executive Committee has decided to convene a meeting at 2:30 PM today to discuss negotiation methods and has already distributed notices inviting all members to attend and deliberate. However, the Waterworks Company is threatening to cut off water supply if the increased water rates are not paid. How the Taxpayers' Association will deal with this if it actually happens, and whether it has made adequate preparations, is a matter of great concern to all residents. A reporter from the "New Voice Society" specifically inquired with the person in charge of the Taxpayers' Association about this issue. The reply was that the Taxpayers' Association's opposition to the water rate increase is based on the five points in the resolution of the representatives' meeting: (1) excessively high interest guarantees and dividend distribution; (2) incomplete installation of water meters; (3) excessive expenses; (4) distribution of bonus shares; (5) bonus shares should not be interest-guaranteed. However, in addition to these five points, the Municipal Council should also be held responsible for the fact that Article 13 of the contract between the Municipal Council and the Waterworks Company stipulates that if the Waterworks Company needs to increase water rates, it should propose it five months in advance. This time, the company only submitted the proposal to the Municipal Council in July and implemented it on September 1st, totaling only two months, which is a complete violation of Article 13 of the contract. As for the company's threat to cut off water to users, the Taxpayers' Association has received the following reports: (1) Wu Jishun at No. 13 Xiwuchang Road is scheduled to have his water cut off on November 28th; (2) Cao Zhenyang at No. 489 Huishan Road is scheduled to have his water cut off on November 27th; (3) Dou Yaoji, a rental accounting firm on Beikaier Road, Yangshupu Road, is scheduled to have its water cut off on November 30th; (4) Shenzhou Hotel has also received a letter from the Waterworks Company setting a deadline for water cut-off. After receiving the letter from Wu Jishun, the Taxpayers' Association forwarded it to the Municipal Council, requesting it to stop this action. However, the Municipal Council's reply on November 14th stated that "(the company may cut off its supply if the user refuses to pay the assessed price)." The Taxpayers' Association believes that water is an essential necessity for life. If the company actually takes such unjust and inhumane action, the first responsible party is the Municipal Council, and the second responsible party is the British Waterworks Company, which will inevitably arouse great indignation among the city's residents, and the consequences may even be unimaginable. This was also discussed at the representatives' meeting the day before yesterday, and it was generally believed that the deadline for water cut-off was just a threat from the Waterworks Company. The fact that the deadline for Wu Jishun and others has passed and has not been implemented shows that the Waterworks Company would never dare to take such an unwise action that risks great disapproval, and users and residents do not need to worry too much. However, in the event that the Waterworks Company insists on going its own way, the Taxpayers' Association is also prepared to immediately convene an emergency meeting of representatives to adopt the most effective methods to order it to immediately restore the water supply and bear the immeasurable losses caused by this action.</p>
<h3>Today's Zhaohe Uprising Commemoration</h3>
<p>Held at the City Party Headquarters at 9:00 AM</p>
<p>December 5th of the Republic of China's fourth year (1915) is the anniversary of the Zhaohe warship uprising planned by the martyr Chen Qimei to attack Yuan (Shikai) stationed in Shanghai. At that time, due to the disparity in strength, it was defeated. Although the event was unsuccessful, the spirit of hating evil like an enemy and acting bravely for righteousness made people respect the past and express the anti-rebellion atmosphere from then on.</p>
<h3>Lan Dong, posthumous portrait of Ke Jun, and Wang Ji, deputy captain, who died in the Zhaohe warship uprising</h3>
<p>The eastern part of the country is filled with the atmosphere. The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters specifically scheduled a commemoration meeting for today (the 5th) at 9:00 AM at the auditorium on the third floor of the Party Headquarters on LinYin Road, Ximen, inviting all sectors of the city.

<h3>The Central Executive Committee Explains the Meaning of Temple Fairs</h3>
<p>The Municipal Executive Committee relayed the order yesterday</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters yesterday instructed the Party Headquarters at all levels in the city, stating: "In order to inform you of a case, the Central Executive Committee's instruction No. 17818 states that recently, lower-level Party Headquarters have occasionally misunderstood the term 'temple fair' in the second item of the 'Measures for Promoting the National Calendar' promulgated by this committee's instruction No. 9933, considering it to be a superstitious behavior belonging to the era of theocracy, and requesting a revision. This is a misunderstanding. Although the temple fair system is an old custom, it is still prevalent in various places. This kind of temple fair is just using the word 'temple' as a trading market, and it has long been purely a commercial gathering without any superstitious elements such as welcoming gods or holding sacrificial ceremonies. It is actually a meeting place for lower-level social daily necessities in market towns and rural markets, and it is closely related to the people. If the meeting period can be changed to follow the national calendar, it will be easier to achieve the effectiveness of promoting the national calendar, and there is no need for revision. In short, the word 'temple fair' referred to here does not refer to superstitious activities such as welcoming gods and holding sacrificial ceremonies. The request for revision is a misunderstanding." The instruction orders all Party Headquarters at all levels to be informed and to instruct their subordinates to be informed as well.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Transfers Customs Personnel</h3>

The remaining four are Zhang Yongnian, Chief Inspector of the Yangyou Customs; Ma Qishan, Assistant of the Jiaohai Customs; Qiu Zhuoqi, Assistant of the Shashi Customs; and Zuo Zhangjin, Secretary of the Fengyang Customs.</p>

<h3>Ma Deji Talks About the Reasons for Resignation</h3>
<p>The Shipbuilding Yard's Finances are Tight</p>
<p>After the reports of Ma Deji, the director of the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy, resigning, a certain gentleman visited Mr. Ma yesterday and made the following remarks: "I (Mr. Ma referred to himself) was transferred from the Fuzhou Shipyard to this position in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927) and have been here for more than three years. This yard is subordinate to the Ministry of the Navy, and the repair of all naval ships is the responsibility of the yard. In the past, the average annual advance payment for repairing naval vessels was only about 100,000 yuan. Since I took over the position, it has been during the rise of the revolutionary army, the suppression of rebellion, and the suppression of communism, one after another. All the vessels participated in the battles, and the repair costs have therefore increased sharply. In the past two or three years, the annual advance payment for repairs has been 500,000 yuan. The yard has no regular maintenance fees and lacks subsidies. The only thing it can use to advance payments is the income from its business operations. In recent years, the social life has become more expensive, and the cost of materials and wages has increased day by day. The business surplus is so small that it cannot be maintained. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China (1928), the yard had a surplus of more than 1.2 million yuan. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929), due to the sharp rise in gold prices during the construction period of the Japanese merchant ship Luoyang Maru, a loss of more than 400,000 yuan was incurred. In addition, the cost of constructing naval vessels such as Xianning, Yongsu, and Minquan was insufficient, resulting in a huge expenditure. The price of gold has not fallen to this day, and it is even more difficult to hope for a surplus. In total, the yard's advance payments for repairing naval vessels have reached more than 2 million yuan in the past three years. All current liquid capital has been used up, so I decided to resign to give way to a more capable person. However, the shipyard is an important institution for the Navy, and the Navy Department will definitely select a capable person to take over."</p>
<h3>The County Rectification Committee Held a Party-Government Talk Yesterday</h3>

As a result, the County Party Headquarters and the County Government were to negotiate and handle it. (4) The County Rectification Committee proposed that the County Agricultural Rectification Committee's funds should be issued according to the amount set by the province and should be issued with the previous shortfall to facilitate work.

<h3>Trade Associations May Set Up Branch Offices</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Simple Rules</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to various trade associations stating that the former Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Group Rectification Committee claimed that the establishment of branch offices would facilitate the handling of association affairs for members in the north and south regions. The request of trade associations to establish branch offices is the same as the establishment of branch offices by the Chamber of Commerce. Although the Law on Industry and Commerce Trade Associations does not have provisions for permitting establishment, in the same urban area, the association's affairs should be facilitated and handled with flexibility. The association has drafted ten articles of simple rules for the organization of trade association branch offices and submitted them to the Second Executive Committee meeting for amendment and approval. The document was submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for review and approval. Now, the approval states that the submitted documents have been reviewed and are generally in compliance. Except that the words "(approved)" in the tenth article should be added with the words "(after filing)", it is temporarily approved for filing. Please comply with the amendment. This approval document is stored, so a copy of the amended simple rules for the organization of trade association branch offices is sent as a letter of notification. Please investigate.</p>
<h3>Seeking Opinions on Raising Funds for Dredging the Shintan Shoal</h3>
<p>Specialized Machinery is Required</p>
<p>The Project Must Be Larger</p>
<p>The Shintan Shoal outside of Wusongkou (also known as Yinsha, which appears and disappears with the tide, hence the name Shintan) is an essential waterway for entering and exiting the Huangpu River. The Dredging Bureau planned to excavate it ten years ago, but due to the large scale of the project and the huge cost involved, it has been delayed until now. However, foreign and Chinese merchants in Shanghai are aware that navigation is not only dangerous but also difficult. In addition, in recent years, the tonnage and draft of ships from all over the world have doubled compared to the past, making it even more difficult to enter and exit Wusongkou. Therefore, Xin Jin Xun, chairman of the Transportation Conference in China, and others wrote to the British Harmony Chamber of Commerce to submit opinions on dredging. The Dredging Bureau convened a meeting with foreign and Chinese merchants to discuss the matter. As a result, raising funds was the first step. According to confirmed information, the Dredging Bureau has been researching the plan for dredging the Shintan Shoal for many years and can prepare to proceed once approved. Recently, the Sino-foreign Merchant Conference has also considered it and is now seeking opinions from major shipping industries on raising funds. According to an engineer from the Dredging Bureau, the foundation of the Shintan Shoal outside of Wusongkou has been surveyed by river engineering experts and technicians from various countries in the past. It is generally believed that the riverbed not only has hidden sand but also extremely hard stone-like sand, which is difficult to apply ordinary dredging machines. In order to dig this sand, it is necessary to use a specially made stone-cutting dredging machine. All of this indicates that the project must be larger.</p>
<h3>The Investigation of the Taxpaying Foreigners' Election is Completed</h3>
<p>2,980 People Have the Right to Vote</p>
<p>Japanese Account for More Than One-Fifth</p>
<p>The public concession's taxpaying foreigners' assembly for the next year will be convened on a regular basis. The bureau has now completed the investigation, registration, and printing of taxpaying foreigners within the area who have the right to vote. A total of 2,980 taxpaying foreigners are eligible to vote in the next term. Among them, the Japanese have the most, with 654 people, accounting for more than one-fifth of the total. The British are second, and the Americans are next. It is expected that the election of the Municipal Council directors in the next term will still maintain the current situation.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Convened a Special Meeting of the Board of Directors</h3>
<p>The Agenda is Not Detailed</p>
<p>The public concession's Municipal Council Board of Directors meeting is regularly held every Wednesday at 4:30 PM. Currently, due to urgent official business that needs to be handled urgently, a special meeting will be convened next Monday. The meeting time is still scheduled for 4:30 PM. The agenda has not yet been announced.</p>
<h3>The Export of Chinese Silk is Declining</h3>
<p>Several More Silk Factories Have Resumed Suspension of Work</p>
<p>Due to various influences, all Chinese silk factories were previously suspended. Subsequently, with the maintenance of the government and the efforts of the industry, a total of forty or fifty factories have resumed work successively. However, in recent days, the sales of Chinese silk exports have been declining day by day, and the competition from Japanese silk is quite strong, resulting in no improvement in the sales of Chinese silk overseas. As a result, the inventory has accumulated, and market prices have fallen, making capital turnover difficult. Yesterday, it was heard that several companies, such as Yufeng and Yongfeng, have temporarily suspended work again to avoid danger.</p>
<h3>The Surtax on Cotton Cloth Should Still Be Levied</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Replies to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance yesterday</p>
<p>telegraphed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in response to the Shanghai cotton cloth industry's request to exempt the surtax on goods: "The former case of the association's East acting as an agent to transfer the Shanghai Municipal Cotton Cloth Industry Association's request to exempt the surtax on goods was previously reviewed by the Ministry in a cold telegram and publicly investigated by the Jiangsu Finance Special Commissioner. The special commissioner's presentation stated that the Jiangyin County Chamber of Commerce Factory Cloth Industry Association had successively requested the cancellation of the 20% disaster relief donation levied on factory cloth. The agency investigated that the donation was a local income of the province, and the Jiangsu Finance Department was consulted to discuss whether to reduce or exempt it. The reply stated that the former instruction of the Jiangsu Provincial Government was issued in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan, stating that no surtax on goods should be levied in the future. Any donation tax levied on goods must be approved by the Ministry of Finance before it can be levied. The general notification originally meant that no surtax on goods should be levied in the future, and that it could not be levied without approval. The intention was that it was not allowed to levy in the future without approval, and that those that had been approved to levy in the past were not subject to restrictions. Jiangsu Province has long been approved to levy a 20% surtax on goods under the goods tax item. It is difficult to stop collecting it when the provincial treasury is in deficit. In addition, there are no newly added surtaxes levied without authorization that have not been approved. The Cotton Cloth Industry Association seems to have slightly misunderstood the scope of the notification restrictions."</p>

<h3>To Ensure Quick Delivery of New Year's Cards</h3>
<p>They Must Be Bundled Separately</p>

<h3>Kidnapping Mistaken for a Robbery of the Bride</h3>
<p>Amei Did Not Want to Sue Her Fiance</p>
<p>Lu Guangrong and Others Were Only Severely Reprimanded</p>
<p>Lu Guangrong, a farmer from Pudong, was betrothed to Ms. Shen, Amei, from Yaojiazhai, Bailinan Road, Shanghai West, by his parents at an early age. It has been fourteen years since then. Amei is now also twenty-one years old, but Lu is poor and unable to marry her. He hired a car from Haining Automobile Company at 1420 Jisi Field Road with his mother, Lu Xu, and brother, Lu Wenqing, early in the morning to rob the bride. When the car passed the intersection of Bailinan Road and Yu Yuan Road, Amei happened to be passing by on her way to the yarn factory. Lu ordered the car to stop, and he and his brother jumped down and dragged Amei onto the car to drive to Wangjia Wharf on the Bund to return across the river. However, Amei was unwilling. Although she was trapped in the car, she shouted loudly. Lu's mother covered her mouth with a handkerchief to make it difficult for her to speak. The driver, Xu Fangshan, did not know that the robbery of the bride was a kidnapping, so he changed course and drove to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to report. The head of the police station ordered Lu and his mother to be detained separately and Amei released. Yesterday, the police station lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Special Zone District Court sued Lu and others for the crime of obstructing freedom. Judge Sun questioned Amei, who confessed that she had been betrothed to Lu Guangrong at the age of seven and said that she did not want to request punishment for the defendant. Judge Sun believed that this was a case that could be prosecuted if the plaintiff declared that she did not want to request punishment for the defendant's crimes. He then ruled that the public prosecution was not accepted, but Lu's and others' behavior of robbing the bride was improper and reprimanded them before releasing them.</p>

<h3>Rice Broker Disappears from Caojiadu Rice Shop</h3>
<p>Went to Shanghai for a Bath and Vanished Without a Trace</p>
<p>Missing for Five Days, No News Received</p>
<p>Cai Jixiang, thirty-eight years old, the chief accountant of Yongmao Rice Shop in Caojiadu Town, West Shanghai, is from Gaoqiao, Pudong. His wife and children live in the countryside. Cai started as an apprentice in the rice shop at a young age (around thirteen or fourteen) through a friend's introduction. He was known for his loyalty, diligence, thrift, hard work, sincerity, and lack of frivolity. He had no bad habits, and was highly valued by the general manager of the rice shop. After completing his apprenticeship, he was gradually promoted, and more than ten years ago, he took charge of the accounting duties. He stayed in the shop all day, never going out for leisure. From then on, he had great power over money. The shop assistants respected and admired him. When the general manager was away on business, Cai was responsible for managing the shop. From his apprenticeship until now, it has been more than twenty years. Even for family matters, he only returned home once or twice a month to take care of things. He never made any mistakes with the shop's money. In recent years, he would occasionally take time off to go to Shanghai for a bath or to see a movie, always at a specific location. If he needed to go elsewhere, he would always notify the shop by phone. Last month, Cai brought several small gold ornaments he owned to the shop, intending to exchange them for silver dollars at a jewelry store, because the price of gold had risen sharply recently. On the afternoon of the twenty-ninth of last month, Cai, because he had some free time at the shop, left the shop around 1 PM with the small gold ornaments, telling people at the shop that he was going to Shanghai to exchange the gold ornaments and take a bath, and that he would return. However, he did not return even by the evening. Everyone at the shop was greatly shocked, thinking that if he had returned home, he would have called. The next day happened to be the end of the month, and the shop needed to settle accounts, so they sent someone to his home to inquire. His family said that he had not returned home, and the whole family was in a panic. They immediately searched everywhere, but found no trace of him. Later, they went to a jewelry store on Avenue Road in the Public Concession to inquire. They said that the gold ornaments had been exchanged for silver dollars, and he had taken away sixty dollars. Therefore, his family became even more anxious, and together with the people from the shop, they tried to investigate. Until yesterday, they still had no news. He has been missing for five days.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for Yang Yunqiu to be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Mr. Yang Yunqiu, the director of the Salt Industry Bank in this city, passed away at his residence in Shanghai on the twenty-second of last month. In his will, he instructed his family not to issue obituaries or hold mourning ceremonies to save expenses. Although his sons felt that the funeral arrangements were too simple, they did not dare to disobey his wishes. Mr. Yang had been doing business in Shanghai for many years and had many friends and relatives, all of whom regretted not being able to offer their condolences. Now, the colleagues from the Salt Industry Bank and the Taiping Bank, which were founded by Mr. Yang, have initiated a public memorial service to be held tomorrow (Sunday) at Baoben Hall, located at the intersection of North Nicheng Bridge, Pingqiao Road, and Changsha Road. All friends and relatives of Mr. Yang are invited to attend on that day. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion with plain carriages and white horses.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Promotes Domestically Produced Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce believes that in recent years, the woolen fabrics and woolen goods consumed by Chinese people have all been imported from foreign countries, resulting in a huge outflow of money. The Zhanghua Woolen Textile Company has created domestically produced products to meet the needs, with the aim of recovering lost rights and interests and preventing the outflow of wealth. The Chamber of Commerce has agreed to promote these products with great effort to maintain domestic goods. Yesterday, a notice was issued to all member businesses to purchase these products as much as possible to show their support for the promotion.</p>
<h3>Mao Yunke Sued by Her Father</h3>
<p>Sued for Stopping Allowance</p>
<p>Requesting Ownership of House on Avenue Joffre</p>
<p>Mao Haisan, the father of actress Mao Yunke, filed a lawsuit yesterday through his lawyer, claiming that his son, Mao Yunke, used to provide him with a monthly allowance of over one hundred yuan. However, recently, Yunke stopped the allowance, leaving him unable to make a living. He requested the court to order that the ownership of the property at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Grosvenor, registered under Mao Yunke's name, be transferred to his name, Mao Haisan, so that he could live out his remaining years. The defendant, Mao Yunke, also through his lawyer, stated that his client strongly opposed all the requests made by the plaintiff. He stated that when Mao Yunke's business was thriving, he provided his father with a monthly allowance of over one hundred yuan in addition to household expenses. Now, due to the decline in business, he is unable to provide the allowance, but all household expenses are still borne by the defendant. He has receipts to prove this. Mao Haisan claimed that the entire Mao family was disrupted by Xia Yueheng. At this point, Mao Yunke stood up and stated that although Xia Yueheng was a friend, he had not disrupted the family. This is proven by the case file. Moreover, he has always been filial and does not want to sue his father in court. Recently, his circumstances have been poor, and the death of his beloved daughter, Jianpei, has caused him great pain. Xia Yueheng then took the stand and stated that he had always been a friend of the Mao family, but he had never interfered in their family affairs. He did not know why Mao Haisan claimed that he had disrupted his family. The lawyers for both parties then presented their arguments. After deliberating, Judge Gong ordered them to leave and await the verdict.</p>
<h3>Old Friend Attempts Extortion with Fake Official Document</h3>
<p>Was Ren Zhongshan Wanted?</p>
<p>The Truth is a Fraudulent Scheme to Obtain Money</p>
<p>Ren Zhongshan, a native of Guiping residing at 183 Rihui Port in West Shanghai, used to be a detective in the First District, Third Squad of the Jiangsu Water Police. After being dismissed, he opened the Renhe Straw Paper Factory and the Renhe Restaurant. On the afternoon of the other day, Lu Wenbin from Changshu, Wu Weide from Xuzhou, Gu Quanfu from Pudong, Xi Senlin, and others went to Ren's house and invited him out for dinner. Lu and Ren used to be colleagues and had a close relationship. After dinner, they went to the Zhonghe Hotel at 689 Fujian Road, Room 16 or 17, for a chat. Ren's cousin, Wu Jian, also arrived. Then, Lu said to Ren, "I am now a detective in the Third District of the Water Police. According to the confession of a bandit recently arrested, you are a member of the bandit chief Taibao A Shu's gang." As he spoke, he took out an official document ordering Ren's arrest. Ren read it and found his name on the list of wanted criminals. Lu continued, "We are old friends, and I should help you." Gu Quanfu, also a detective in the Third District, seized the opportunity to speak and secretly discussed the matter. Gu demanded four hundred yuan, but Ren refused because the amount was too large. After others intervened, they agreed on two hundred yuan. Ren first issued a Shanghai Bank check for fifty yuan, and the remaining money was left with Wu Jian as collateral, so that Ren could go out and raise the money. Once Ren was free, he reported the matter to the Zhabei Police Station. The police chief dispatched detectives Cui Chengke and Liu Chunshu, along with Western detectives, to the hotel. They arrested Lu Wenbin, Wu Weide, Gu Quanfu, Xi Senlin, Wei Zuanming, Xu Maolin, and others. Lu's handcuffs, detective ID card, instruction letter, and the check given by Ren were all confiscated. Wu Jian managed to escape. Yesterday, they were sent to the Special District Court. Judge Xu conducted the trial. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that Lu was being prosecuted for fraud and obstruction of freedom. Then, Ren recounted what had happened. The court ordered the four defendants, Lu Wenbin, and others, to be detained for a later hearing. Wei Zuan, Xu Maolin, and Lin were each released on bail of fifty yuan.</p>
<h3>Fat Woman Hangs Herself, Destroys Beam</h3>
<p>Dies because of Gambling</p>
<p>Liu Mao’s life should not be ended</p>
<p>Liu Yuanshan, from Ningbo, who lived at 1014 Gonghexin Road, Zhabei, ran an old goods business. His wife, Mao, was thirty-seven years old and had two daughters. The couple's relationship was very affectionate, but Mao was addicted to gambling and always sought guidance from the gods, hoping to get lucky. Unfortunately, her luck had been bad lately, and she always lost, leading to a growing mountain of debt. She secretly pawned her clothes and jewelry. She then heard that there was a particularly effective Bodhisattva in a small temple by the river south of Liuying Bridge. Anyone who went to pray for gambling luck would always win. Mao was moved by this and pawned everything she had at home, obtaining twenty-five yuan. Yesterday morning, before dawn, she got up secretly, carrying incense and candles to the temple, where she kowtowed and prayed. She then fell asleep and dreamed of a huge black fish jumping out of the river. She immediately woke up, believing it was a sign of "black fish," and happily returned home, betting all twenty-five yuan on "black fish." Unexpectedly, the result was a complete disappointment. Thinking she could not face her husband, she had the idea of committing suicide. She untied her belt and hanged herself from the beam. Who knew that her life should not have ended. The beam in the house was old and rotten, and Mao was quite large, so her weight was too much. The beam broke and she fell to the ground with a loud crash. Her neighbor, Xiang, heard the noise and entered the house. She saw Mao lying on the ground, a thick rope tied around her neck, her face pale. Xiang was terrified and hurriedly called for her father, Liu. Liu was shocked to see the scene and tried to revive her. After she regained consciousness and explained what had happened, Liu was relieved and happy, and he persuaded her. Mao vowed never to repeat the attempt.</p>
<h3>Chief Steward Attempts to Defile British Girl</h3>
<p>Wang Zhonglin, eighteen years old, a Ningbo native who works as a chief steward for a British family at 120 Baker Road, was overcome by bestial desire yesterday at 6:15 PM. He grabbed the owner's four-year-old daughter, named Somillan Pan Qu Pan Qu (transliteration), removed her pants, and intended to commit indecent acts. The amah, Yang Xu, saw this and reported it to the owner, who reported it to the Yangshupu Police Station. The police ordered the arrest of Wang and sent the girl to the hospital for examination. The doctor confirmed that the girl's hymen had not been broken and that she had not been raped. However, Wang's pants were found to have semen on them, and his glans was not swollen. The police chief ordered Wang to be detained pending transfer to the Special District Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>You Quangen to be Sentenced on a Scheduled Date</h3>
<p>Continued Hearing Yesterday Due to Involvement in Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>Wuxi Native Association Willing to Guarantee Him</p>
<p>You Quangen, a native of Wuxi, was previously found by the police to be involved in the kidnapping case of Liu Nianchun. He was detained and sent to the Special District Court for interrogation and held for further investigation. Yesterday afternoon, the hearing continued. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the progress of the police investigation during the postponement and clarified that the defendant was related to the case based on the confession of the executed kidnapper Yu Baoren. He requested that he be punished according to law. The defendant's representative lawyers, Zhang Deqin and Peng Qixiu, argued that although You was falsely accused by Yu Baoren due to a grudge, the victim had already been interrogated and could not prove that the defendant was at the scene. The police did not find any evidence of a crime, so it was obvious that the defendant was not involved in the case. They requested that he be declared innocent. The Wuxi Native Association, because You had served as an investigator for the association, submitted a letter proving You's character and expressed their willingness to guarantee You. Judge Wu then announced the end of the debate and ordered the defendant to be taken back into custody to await a scheduled sentencing.</p>
<h3>Beef Seller Injured by Chopping</h3>
<p>Culprit Lu Miaofa Detained</p>
<p>Fu Linsheng, a local resident of 61 Nanyang Lane, Seymour Road, sells beef at the market for a living and has some savings. On the morning of the 23rd of last month, at 6:00 AM, Fu was riding in a chartered car when he encountered one robber with a pistol and two robbers with axes on Avenue Road, Park Road. They demanded money. Fu gave them twenty-five yuan in banknotes, but they refused and chopped Fu in the waist and back with an axe before fleeing. Fu was injured and returned home by car. He and his wife, Liang, reported the incident to the police station and then went to the hospital. The Public Security Bureau arrested a suspect, Lu Miaofa. The New Zhabei Police Station brought him back and handed him over to the Special District Court yesterday. According to the police lawyer, the defendant went to Fu's house on the 17th of last month and demanded one thousand yuan but did not get it. Three days later, he went again with two accomplices and demanded five hundred yuan, but also did not get it. Therefore, he resorted to this vicious means. Fu and his wife then filed a complaint and identified the defendant in court as one of the perpetrators. Judge Sun asked the defendant why he insisted on demanding money from him. Fu replied that he really did not know. The defendant claimed that he also had a beef stall on Seymour Road and was a neighbor of Fu's stall. Fu always acted like an elder and recruited many followers. Last month, when I had a fight with Fu's followers, Fu used it as an excuse to pick a quarrel and forcibly demanded five yuan from me, otherwise he would not allow me to set up a stall. Fearing his power, I had to stop working and go home to farm for a living. I don't know who injured Fu. Judge Sun ordered the defendant to be detained for investigation and verification.</p>

<p>Liu Jialu, a native of Hubei who runs a rosewood workshop inside the New North Gate, was sued in the local court by the son of his deceased brother, claiming that the rosewood workshop belonged to his brother. After his brother's death, Liu moved in with his brother's mistress and took over the business, occupying the nest like a magpie. He was accused of embezzling 300,000 worth of property. Liu was released on bail for investigation. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff withdrew the lawsuit and disappeared. At the same time, Liu was ordered to be arrested. Yesterday, Liu Jialu surrendered and was awaiting trial. The prosecutor ordered him to be temporarily detained. Unexpectedly, Liu had several opium bubbles hidden in his crotch, which were discovered.</p>
<h3>Can the Main Culprit in a Murder Case Be Released on Bail?</h3>
<p>Gu Wuxin, a native of Taizhou from Beirun Lane, South Railway Station, was brutally murdered by Zhao Bingsheng, Zhao Binglin, Zhang Wensheng, and others on September 21 of the lunar calendar due to a feud. The bailiffs of the local court arrested Zhao Binglin and Zhang Wensheng and detained them. The main culprit, Zhao Bingsheng, fled. However, when the incident occurred, the local police station was nearby and had arrested Zhao Bingsheng and sent him to the Second District Police Station. But Zhao Bingsheng was released on bail by a dye shop on Coal Ash Road in that district. The victim's family believed that the main culprit in a murder case should not be released on bail and filed a petition with the local court to arrest the guarantor from the dye shop and order him to hand over the person. The guarantor then captured Zhao Bingsheng from another location yesterday and sent him to the court for punishment. However, all the defendants in this case have already been prosecuted by the prosecutor.</p>
<h3>Guandong Sandboat Jinxiangshun Robbed by Pirates</h3>
<p>Looted in Hengsha Waters</p>
<p>The Guandong sandboat Jinxiangshun, loaded with several cabins of salted beltfish and other northern goods from Lushun, was heading to Shanghai for sale. At around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, while sailing through the Hengsha waters outside the Wusongkou, five pirate ships suddenly appeared, fully loaded with pirates, blocking its path. The pirates, armed with weapons, jumped onto the Jinxiangshun and forced it to change course towards the open sea. At the same time, a Hupu sandboat was also seen being looted. While traveling on the ocean, they released one of the crew members.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Yesterday, they arrived at Song and reported to Shen Daily that they would demand money to ransom the boats. It is reported that there were more than ten crew members on the Jinxiangshun, and the salted beltfish and northern goods were worth more than ten thousand silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Woman Attempts Suicide by Poisoning, Life in Danger</h3>
<p>Fan Hongfu, a broker at the Commodities Exchange on Avenue Edward VII, lives at 3 Fuxing Road, Old Race Course Road. His family is quite wealthy and owns a car for transportation. His wife, Qiu, is twenty-eight years old, literate, and quiet. The other day (the 2nd), Fan lost over seven hundred taels of silver in market trading. After returning home, he was extremely frustrated and had an argument with his wife, Qiu. Afterwards, Qiu secretly went out to buy poison, intending to end her life, but failed. On the 3rd, she heard that her husband had lost even more money. Then yesterday after 5:00 PM, when Fan finished his work and returned home, he saw Qiu lying stiffly on the bed, her eyes fixed and her mouth gaping. He found two bottles of Anshenle pills under her pillow, one empty and one still full, as well as a receipt from the Wuzhou Pharmacy in Hongkou, sold on the 2nd. He knew she had taken poison and immediately used his car to send her to Tongren Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, she had taken too much poison and her life was in danger. The hospital then notified the Hongkou Police Station, who ordered an investigation.</p>
<h3>Girl Killed by Car</h3>
<p>At 6:30 last night, at the intersection of Huishan Road and Broadway Road in Hongkou, a girl, about ten years old, looking like she was from Jiangbei and wearing ragged clothes, was wandering in the road. Suddenly, a black-licensed car sped by and ran her over. Her skull was fractured, and her large intestine ruptured. She died instantly. The patrol officer heard the news and arrived, using a vehicle to transport the body to Tongren Hospital and then to the morgue for autopsy.</p>
<h3>Sun Hongcheng Robbed by Pirates Twice</h3>
<p>Both in the Qingkou Waters</p>
<p>The Dalian sandboat Sun Hongcheng set sail last month from Shanghai, loaded with goods worth more than 50,000 taels of silver, including native cloth, to be delivered to Dalian. While sailing in the Qingkou waters, it suddenly encountered a large group of pirates in several pirate ships. Seeing a merchant ship being surrounded and looted, the crew of the Sun Hongcheng immediately hoisted their sails and sped forward to avoid danger. Suddenly, they were spotted by the pirates, and two pirate ships chased after them and fired guns. Two crew members of the Sun boat were wounded by bullets. The crew tried their best to sail, but the pirate ships kept chasing for more than ten miles. Fortunately, the steamship's whistle sounded, and the pirates stopped chasing after hearing the sound. The Sun boat narrowly escaped danger and immediately sailed to Dalian. The two injured crew members were sent to the hospital for treatment, and the cargo was unloaded. After inspecting the ship, a hole was found on the left side of the ship, which did not cause any damage. After hiring workers to repair it, it sailed back to Shanghai. In Dalian, it loaded over five hundred pieces of northern goods and set sail. It then loaded melon seeds in Jiaozhou and sailed back to Shanghai. When it sailed to the Qingkou waters on the border of Jiangsu and Shandong, it encountered two pirate ships again. The two pirate ships approached head-on and surrounded the ship from left and right, opening fire and ordering it to stop. The owner of the Sun boat saw that the pirate ships had arrived and that it was impossible to escape. The ship owner hid in the cabin and left it to the pirates. The crew was also terrified and at a loss. The pirates swarmed onto the ship and started shooting randomly, injuring several crew members. The pirates searched everywhere and found seven or eight hundred silver dollars in the shipowner's room. Dissatisfied, they forced the crew to point out the shipowner. The crew was unable to lead them to the rear cabin and pointed him out. The pirates dragged the shipowner out and forced him to hand over the silver dollars. When he refused, they slapped him and dragged him to the pirate ship and kidnapped him, telling the crew to quickly prepare three thousand silver dollars to redeem the shipowner. The two pirate ships sailed to the East Sea. The Sun ship is now anchored in Fushan. Yesterday, several crew members came to Shanghai to report the incident, requesting that the shipowner be rescued.</p>
<h3>Wu Xiaosanzi Falls into River, Bleeds</h3>
<p>Wu Xiaosanzi from Jiangbei, a foreman at Fengda Warehouse, lives in Dongjiadu, Pudong. Yesterday evening, he was returning home from watching a play in the city. He hired a boat at Wangjia Wharf to cross the river to Pudong. When the boat arrived at the wharf, Wu hurriedly disembarked, lost his footing, and fell into the water. A crew member used a pole to rescue him, preventing him from drowning, but the iron tip of the pole injured his head, creating a gash more than an inch wide and causing excessive bleeding. His family sent him to the hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, if there are no complications within three days, his life can be saved.</p>
<h3>Two Prisoners Die of Illness</h3>
<p>Shen A Hai, twenty-eight years old, was convicted of murdering another person and sentenced to ten years imprisonment by the former Mixed Court. After being sent to the Western Prison, it was found that Ma Chunrong, thirty-four years old, was also convicted of murder and sentenced to a very long term of imprisonment. Recently, both prisoners suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis and died the other day. Their bodies were sent to the morgue on Fielun Road for autopsy. Yesterday morning, Guo Huaipu, a prosecutor from the Special District Court, came to the morgue to confirm the death. As there were no relatives to claim the bodies, it was ordered that Pushan Villa provide coffins and burial.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Security Bureau Hires Temporary Detectives</h3>
<p>Yuan, the director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, believes that the winter defense is important as winter approaches. The winter defense operation has been implemented since the first of this month. However, the police force is weak. The police force of the six police squads has been distributed and dispatched to various districts to assist in defense. The number of detectives in the detective team is insufficient. Each district office can only send one detective as a leader and three or four or five or six detectives to specialize in the investigation of kidnapping and theft cases. However, each district has four or five sub-offices, or at least three or four. If each office has a resident detective, the district office will have no detectives to dispatch when theft and other cases occur, and only the lead detective can take on the investigation, which is not a careful way to investigate and arrest. The district chiefs of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh districts have found that their jurisdictions are vast and that with the winter approaching, criminal activity is rampant, and investigation is particularly important. It is urgent to hire additional detectives to assist in investigations. The district chiefs presented the request to Director Yuan, who approved the hiring of ten temporary detectives in each district office. The detectives will be controlled by the district chiefs and will not be affiliated with the detective team. They will specialize in winter defense investigations within the district office. The lead detective will supervise the work. Each detective will receive a monthly salary of over ten yuan, which will be issued by the district chief. A temporary detective license with only the district chief's private seal will be issued for official business. A sufficient number of detectives have now been hired, ten in each district, for a total of seventy in seven districts. All are experienced investigators and have found reliable shopkeepers to guarantee them. They reported to duty on the first of this month.</p>
<h3>Entanglements of Period Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Grain Association Sets Meeting on 6th to Mediate</p>
<p>When the price of foreign rice was high this summer, the number of futures contracts for foreign rice traded daily was huge. One commodity was resold six or seven times. However, when it came time to deliver the goods, new rice from domestic production areas entered the market. This year's harvest was abundant, so the source was abundant, and the market price fell. As a result, the price of foreign rice also gradually fell. However, at the time of delivery, the market price was several yuan per dan lower than the transaction price. The seller urged the buyer to take delivery, but the buyer refused. This has been delayed until now. Although the seller has repeatedly urged delivery, the market price is even lower than before, so the buyer and seller are very entangled. Recently, fights have even occurred in the market. The Grain Association has repeatedly convened meetings of buyers and sellers to mediate. However, for small amounts, the leaders have persuaded both parties to reach a settlement. For large amounts, the losses are too great, and no resolution has been reached. The association believes that it is not a good idea to leave this unresolved. They have now scheduled a meeting of all members on the 6th to discuss mediation methods to resolve the issue.</p>
<h3>South City Clinic of the Labor Hospital</h3>
<p>Located at the Former Site of the Epidemic Prevention Department</p>
<p>Clinics to Open Tomorrow</p>
<p>Since July of this year, the Epidemic Prevention Department of the Shanghai Labor Hospital on Shangwen Road, South City, has been conducting three months of free diagnosis and medication, saving countless lives. However, as the weather has turned cold and the epidemic has subsided, and the hospital's funds have been exhausted, the epidemic prevention services have been temporarily suspended. At the same time, the chairman of the Hospital Affairs Committee, Pan Gong_, requested the municipal government to allocate funds for subsidies. Approval was granted to provide a monthly subsidy of one thousand yuan starting in the 20th year. After deliberation by the Hospital Affairs Committee, it was decided that the main hospital was located far away in West Shanghai, and the benefits to laborers were not widespread. It was decided to establish a branch clinic at the former site of the Epidemic Prevention Department in South City. The operating expenses will be paid from the subsidy allocated by the municipal government. It has been decided to open the clinic as early as the 5th of this month. Fortunately, the clinic equipment is already available, and the medical staff have been agreed upon by the director of the department, Li Runxiang, who will temporarily not receive a salary and will fulfill his obligations to meet the expectations of the laborers. It is said that the consultation hours will be the same as those of the main hospital, from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>National Shipping Companies Compete in Sino-European Shipping</h3>
<p>Observations on the Rise and Fall of British, French, German, and Japanese Shipping Businesses</p>
<p>With the military end to the North-South unification in China, various foreign shipping companies in China are actively expanding in preparation for developing their trade with China. The expansion of Sino-European shipping companies is summarized below:</p>
<p>Great Britain Profits and Builds Ships: The British company has seen significant improvement in both freight and passenger business since adding the "R" series of four new 16,000-ton ships to the Sino-British route. Among export goods, silk and tea account for more of its cargo volume than any other shipping company. This year, it has been the leader in transporting silk and tea to Europe, followed by Blue Funnel Line. Each regular voyage from Shanghai alone generates approximately 100,000 yuan in freight revenue. This year, the Shanghai-London route has been increased to three ships per month (originally two ships). Starting this month, the 16,000-ton "C" series ships will also be added to the Sino-British route. In October, direct mail ships to Australia were also added. At the beginning of last month, passenger ships to the South Pacific islands were also launched, with Sino-Indian ships also carrying Chinese passengers traveling to and from the region. The company has received a telegram from London reporting that the total surplus from the Far East shipping operations, including the Sino-European, Sino-Indian, and Sino-Australian routes, amounted to 866,000 pounds in the first nine months of this year. This amount, along with the company's accumulated funds from previous years, will be used to build six new oil-powered ships specifically for joining the Central Indian and Australian routes in preparation for competing in the Far East shipping industry, to be deployed to China next year.</p>
<p>French Mail Service Urgently Adds New Ships: The French Postal Shipping Company has historically carried the most silk from China to Europe, hence the saying in the shipping industry that "British ships carry more tea, French ships carry more silk." However, this year's situation has changed, with French ships carrying less silk than British ships, and even less tea. The company's investigation revealed that its new fast ships are not as numerous as those of Great Britain. Now that China has declared unification and Far East shipping is just beginning to develop, the French Postal Shipping Company is urgently building four of the latest type of oil-powered, strong, and top-class mail ships in Marseille, each with a displacement of 24,000 tons, specifically for use on the Sino-French route to compete for silk and tea export business. Once these four ships are completed, the sea voyage can be shortened, with Shanghai to France taking only 33-34 days, reducing the journey by four to five days. The Shanghai office has received a telegram from Paris stating that the first ship has been launched and will begin service to Shanghai in March next year, with all ships in operation by June.</p>
<p>German Ships Establish Dedicated Routes: The German Hamburg Company has expanded the Sino-German route to 52 voyages per year since acquiring the Tianli Shipping Company. Recently, the Sino-German route has been divided into A and B routes, each with sixteen or seventeen ships, with four ships sailing each month. A route ships sail to North China, while B route ships sail to Japan. Recently, the company, recognizing that there are more ships than cargo on the Sino-German route, has changed its approach. Starting with the "Bakin" ship arriving in Shanghai this month, the Sino-German route has been reduced by half, leaving only sixteen or seventeen ships, and the routes have been divided. A route ships are dedicated to the Sino-German route, also serving North China, while B route ships are converted to direct German-Japanese routes, canceling their service to China, so that each is responsible for a specific task and avoids the loss of having too many ships and not enough cargo. This will be implemented from the 25th of this month. The company's top executives have gone to Germany to discuss the company's new plans for Far East shipping after China's unification.</p>
<p>Japanese Mail Service Reduces Routes and Staff: The Japanese Mail Service added two new ships, "Shokokumaru" and "Seokokumaru," this year to the Sino-European route, but business has been sluggish. The "Kitano Maru" had already been rerouted, and now the "Kamo Maru," which recently arrived in Shanghai from London, has also been removed from service. The Chinese sailors on the ships will be dismissed and sent back to Shanghai. This year, the company's business on all routes has been average, with no profit even from official business. Starting from the first of this month, the head office has laid off eighty land-based office workers and eighty sea-based office workers. The Shanghai branch has also been ordered to lay off twelve or thirteen people, and performance reviews are currently underway. Furthermore, the Osaka Company will, starting this month, reassign the "London Maru" and "Paris Maru" from the Pacific route to the Sino-European route. In order to maintain the shipping industry, each shipping company is requesting that the government allocate 5 million yuan from German reparations to subsidize shipping costs, in order to compete with other countries in European shipping. The Japanese Ministry of Communications has already approved the request from the shipping companies.</p>
<h3>Female Worker Commits Suicide by Hanging</h3>
<p>Zhang Jingli, a 17-year-old female worker from Dongyang, Zhejiang Province, at the No. 2 Yong'an Factory in Wusong, was brought to work by Zhang Genquan, a trainee from Workshop No. 124. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, she returned home from working the night shift, looking dejected, likely because she was reprimanded by the car manager for poor work performance. After arriving at her residence, she didn't eat or drink and went straight to bed. She didn't have dinner either, so she was scolded by Zhang Genquan. Angered, Zhang Jingli went outside and went to work at the factory. People saw her enter the factory at the time, but unexpectedly, she went out through the back door. On the morning of the 3rd, when work ended, Zhang Jingli was found lying at the back door. A doctor was called, but she was already dead. Her body was carried back to Zhang Genquan's place. Zhang's wife undressed her and found a belt around her neck, wrapped five times. However, she was not hanging, so the circumstances of her death by hanging are bizarre. Yesterday morning, Yu Shoulian, the head of the 33rd district, reported the case to the local court. Prosecutor Li and Inspector Shen arrived at the scene to investigate. After untying the belt, they examined the deceased's neck and found marks from a rope. It was determined that she died by hanging, likely by first making a loop and then hanging it high, and that the rope came off after death, which is why she wasn't found hanging. The cause of death was likely due to repeated anger and suicide. In addition to determining the method of death, there were also marks on the deceased's cheeks indicating that she had been slapped before death. The judge then ordered the body to be prepared for burial and ordered further investigation.</p>
<h3>Freight Truck Kills Chen Pengqiu</h3>
<p>Chen Pengqiu, a 32-year-old native of Hunan, worked as a servant and resided at No. 70 Lapeid Road, Lafei Lane, in the French Concession, in the Wengzhou Villa owned by his employer, surnamed Zhou. On the evening of the 3rd, at 6 p.m., Chen went out alone and was walking in front of No. 295 Baoyu Lane, Edward Avenue, in the French Concession, when a freight truck No. 1512 driven by Li Alin (license No. 2034) of the Mintini Yin Road Ningbo Moving Company was driven over and was unable to avoid him, causing him to be hit and injured. The police arrived, recorded the license plate number, and sent Chen to the hospital. He died en route. The body was transferred to the Tongren Party Hall for an autopsy. The incident was reported to the police chief, who ordered an investigation. The deceased's family members are all in his hometown; only his employer is in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Vehicle Affairs Department of the French Concession Police Department reported to the French Court. Judge Zhu conducted an autopsy and determined that the body was injured and killed by a car. Since there were no family members in Shanghai, he ordered that photos be taken and the body taken into custody by the court, and that the defendant, the truck driver, be released on bail pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Duties of Film Censorship Authorities</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education had previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan asking whether the existing film censorship authorities in various locations should cease operations before the promulgation of the "Regulations for the Implementation of Film Censorship" and the establishment of the Film Censorship Committee. The Executive Yuan responded with Directive No. 3337, stating: "The Ministry's submission has been noted. The 'Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Film Censorship' are being jointly drafted by the Ministry and the Ministry of Interior and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. Before the rules are approved by the Executive Yuan and the Film Censorship Committee is established, all existing film censorship authorities in various locations should temporarily continue to perform their duties. The Ministry should immediately comply with the previous order and handle the matter in accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the Film Censorship Law."</p>
<h3>Record of Salary Increases for Railway Employees</h3>
<p>The Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Police Headquarters issued an order that the salaries of all officers under its jurisdiction be increased annually. According to established practice, salaries are increased once a year, in January or July. However, the increase for July of this year has not yet been implemented and should be added starting in January of next year. Salary increases should be given separately according to the December payroll. The police chief will receive an increase of ten yuan, the deputy police chief (i.e., inspector) five yuan, the document clerk four yuan, the patrol captain two yuan, and the patrol officer one yuan. Yesterday, the two Railway Police Chiefs, Kong Fanjun, issued a circular to the heads of each division to check the December payroll and forward it so that it could be compiled and submitted to the bureau chief for review and approval by the accounting department for payment with the January payroll next year. It is reported that various departments such as vehicle affairs, machinery affairs, engineering affairs, materials, and station staff will also receive separate salary increases starting in January.</p>
<h3>Another Shipping Line Between Shanghai and Ningbo</h3>
<p>The "Kaiyuan" Ship to Begin Service</p>
<p>There are currently several ships operating between Shanghai and Ningbo, including Ning Shao, San Bei, and Taikoo. Due to the increasing number of passengers and cargo, they are struggling to keep up. Recently, merchants such as Bao Dading have established the Kaili Shipping Company and purchased an old ship from the Japanese Kagoshima Shipping Company. The old ship "Chikugo River Maru" has a deadweight of 800 tons and is priced at 50,000 yuan. It is currently being repaired by the Yiesong Shipyard and is scheduled to begin service on the Shanghai-Ningbo line this year. The ship will be named "Kaiyuan." From then on, there will be one more shipping line between Shanghai and Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Tongchang Car Company Expands Business</h3>
<p>Hosted a Banquet for Newspaper Reporters Last Night</p>

<h3>Chinese Art Exhibition to be Held in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Japanese Representative, Member of Parliament Sakanishi, Arrives in Shanghai to Negotiate</p>
<p>Sakanishi Rihachiro, a member of the Japanese House of Peers, arrived in Shanghai from Japan on the Nagasaki Maru the other day and stayed at the Towa Foreign Firm. According to what he told people, his mission to China this time is to negotiate on behalf of the Chinese Art Exhibition to solicit exhibits. This is because the Japanese government and the National Culture Association plan to hold a Chinese Art Exhibition in Tokyo for one month starting on April 26th of next year. The exhibition will display approximately 200 pieces of various ancient artworks from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. It is also planned to solicit valuable exhibits from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places for display at that time. Mr. Sakanishi took the overnight express train to Beijing on the night before last at 11 p.m.</p>
<h3>National Match Association Requests Extension of Transportation Fee Reduction</h3>
<p>The National Match Industry Association submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways yesterday to extend the reduction of transportation fees for another year. The original text stated: "We respectfully request that the Ministry approve the extension of the preferential treatment of reducing the transportation fees for finished match products, matchbox slices, etc. from Chinese factories to the fourth-class rate for one year in order to overcome difficulties and provide relief. Our association believes that because the match industry has been declining due to foreign goods, the members of our association went to Beijing in December of the 18th year of the Republic of China to petition the various ministries of the National Government and the Ministry of Railways for relief. The National Government and the various ministries agreed to provide relief, and the Executive Yuan approved the relief measures. The Ministry of Railways first approved the proposal on January 30th with document number Ye Zi 1248, reducing the transportation fees for finished match products, matchbox slices, and box boards from Chinese factories to the fourth-class rate for one year. This demonstrates the utmost concern for protecting industry. Since the implementation of this measure on March 1st of this year, all members of the association have been grateful. However, the one-year period will soon expire, and the National Government's fundamental relief measures have not yet been implemented. The fierce flames of foreign goods have not been extinguished, and the situation of the match industry is still precarious. If support is not continued, all previous efforts will be in vain. Therefore, we respectfully request that the Ministry, considering the difficult situation, approve the extension of the preferential treatment of reducing the transportation fees for finished match products, matchbox slices, and box boards from Chinese factories to the fourth-class rate for one year, so that there will still be emergency relief measures to overcome difficulties and provide protection before the National Government's fundamental relief measures are implemented. We urgently await your approval. National Match Industry Association to the Ministry of Railways."</p>

<h3>News from the French Concession Water and Electricity Union</h3>
<p>Although the labor dispute at the Shanghai French Concession Water and Electricity Union has been settled for a long time, several conditions have not yet been agreed upon, causing frequent complaints from the workers. Recently, the atmosphere has become increasingly tense. Mediator Du Yuesheng, considering that the end of the year is approaching, fears that if these conditions are repeatedly delayed, disputes will arise. Therefore, he had already consulted with the capital side the day before yesterday. The capital side proposed several methods, which the labor side unanimously believed were still far from the principle, so they all expressed dissatisfaction. Moreover, the capital side has recently used divisive tactics to allow them to be eliminated on their own. Mr. Du also said that if these workers are still working in the union, the conditions for negotiations will be suspended. Last night, the union convened a meeting of group leaders to discuss this matter, and everyone was extremely angry. They said that the agreement clearly stated that the wages of the dismissed workers who remained in the union to work would be paid by the company equally with the workers in the factory. How could there be disagreements at this time? The union representatives Zhang Renjun, Lu Guanhong, Zhang Qixiang, etc., were delegated to go to Du's residence and strongly negotiated to achieve the principle and never back down.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Visit to the Soviet Union by the Social Work Class of Daxia University</h3>
<p>— Yang Qijing</p>
<p>Sociology in China can be said to be in a very naive stage, or it can be said to be in the budding stage. Therefore, the attention paid to sociology by various universities in China is only a matter of a few years. Up to now, the establishment of sociology departments in various universities is still not universal. Therefore, the lack of a good phenomenon in China's social relief undertakings is also a natural state. The sociology department of Daxia University cannot be said, and dare not say, is the best sociology department in southeastern China. However, in any case, it can at least be believed that the sociology department of Daxia is on the road of progress and development. Since Dr. Wu Zelin, a sociology expert, was hired by the school in the 17th year of the Republic of China to serve as the director of the department, it has been constantly improving in the past two years. It can be compared with the sociology department of Yanjing University, and the academic program of the sociology department of Daxia University in each semester is the crown of universities in Shanghai. This is a fact, and there is no need for me to describe it further.</p>
<p>This semester, the sociology department of Daxia University has further advanced from the theoretical exploration to the study of social facts. The most important courses are naturally the social work and social investigation courses. Both of these courses are taught by Dr. Wu himself, so the progress is more vigorous. The plan of the course is like this: social work is to study the theory and implementation of social relief undertakings in various countries, and at the same time, to examine the situation of social relief undertakings in China and discuss how to improve them. Therefore, the teaching of this course is both explaining the theory in the classroom and going out to visit and review. In addition, the social investigation class is also like this, doing practical work at the same time, conducting systematic research on the actual situation of the farmers' lives near Daxia New Village. In addition to the work report of the social investigation class, which is not within the scope of this article and will not be described, the following is a report on the situation of the social work class's visit to the Soviet Union and the feelings gained from the visit.</p>
<p>The only goal of the visit to the Soviet Union was the insane asylum in the Gospel Hospital in Suzhou. It is said that this insane asylum is the best in China, except for one in Guangzhou. We obtained the permission of the hospital, and we decided to go to Suzhou, and we could also visit other social relief agencies in Suzhou.</p>
<p>This time, we agreed to go with the students of the social work class of Guanghua University. There were thirteen students from Guanghua and seventeen from Daxia, for a total of thirty-one people, including the professor. That day happened to be cloudy and windy, but we were not daunted by our enthusiastic desire.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Suzhou and got off the train, there were already thirty or so rickshaws neatly arranged outside the station. This was because we had asked a classmate to prepare in advance. These thirty or so rickshaws ran swiftly on the streets of Suzhou in a row. Of course, the impact would attract the attention of the shop assistants and pedestrians in the shops on both sides. They seemed to be very surprised to see so many people in Western clothes sitting in so many rickshaws passing by like flying.</p>
<p>We first went to visit our only destination—the Gospel Hospital. With the cordial reception and guidance of the director of the hospital, our hope was happily achieved. The part of the hospital that treats the insane is in a separate hospital. At this time, the number of insane people admitted was about seventy, more than forty men and more than twenty women. However, what is surprising and worthy of attention is that, according to the results of the visit and inquiry, almost all of the large number of insane people have considerable knowledge. Among the men, there are actually two who have studied abroad and have degrees. Among the women, some are teachers at St. Mary's, some are teachers at Piwen Girls' School, and some have even served in the Central Party Department. It is said that the causes of their madness are almost all dominated by the two major problems of economy and marriage. This is a problem worthy of attention and a fact worthy of study.</p>
<p>Whether the insane people admitted by the insane department of the Gospel Hospital can be used as a standard to study the problem of insane people in China is naturally something I dare not say categorically. However, the situation here is already a fact. This is a fact worthy of discussion. Perhaps it can be temporarily regarded as a representative fact. Then, the ease with which insane people are produced among intellectuals can be based on the facts here. And the economic system of China in recent years has shaken, and the marital system is in the process of alternating between the old and the new, resulting in the production of a large number of insane people. These are all facts that social service agencies should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Secondly, we went to the nursing home to see it. The nursing home in Suzhou can be said to be the better of the completely old-fashioned ones. On the surface, their rooms are still tall and spacious, and the clothes and utensils are still clean. However, there is only one large room with forty or fifty babies densely arranged, so the air and light are naturally not sufficient. Further research into the condition of these forty or fifty babies reveals that we only hear their crying, and a closer look at their faces shows that most of them are sick. This kind of state seems to be unknown in the minds of the people in charge of the agency, and they have not taken out their attention and paid attention to these.</p>
<h3>Outside the Venue</h3>
<p>— Ice Photo</p>
<p>Again, I saw the old people's home. This is a very large but dirty place. There are two or three hundred old women admitted in it. The situation of the equipment can be said to be an accumulation of a slum. I am really embarrassed to describe it. I really dare not say that this is a social poverty relief agency in the civilized country of China in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Finally, we ran to the women's relief association to take a look. It seems that this was specially arranged for us to visit, so it is difficult to observe the usual situation and treatment inside. However, the statistics of several charts hanging in the association are very detailed and worthy of attention.</p>
<p>In addition, we also visited the Jiangsu Third Prison by the way, but I am unwilling to describe the situation here and the feelings after the visit, because I think this is a political facility problem, so let it be left for other opportunities related to this in the future to talk about. In this way, we visited the five agencies mentioned above in one day, and took the night train back to Shanghai that day.</p>
<p>In short, after this visit, at least we feel the following about the facilities of social relief agencies in China. I think the facilities of social relief agencies in China are too lacking in scientificization. The people in charge are almost absolutely lacking in scientific spirit, and almost completely hand over these undertakings to a group of experienced and prudent people to handle. They simply do not understand the purpose of relieving social diseases. Therefore, the existing relief methods are biased towards ethical concepts, only thinking that saving their lives and prolonging their lives is to do their best in charity, and never thinking about actively rescuing and giving the diseased a proper way out. This is a business worthy of attention. I hope that those in charge of the social business of the church will think about it and improve it.</p>
<h3>Concert</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>The autumn morning is lonelyly intoxicated in the gentleness of the thick fog. The orange-red morning sun slowly unveils the bronze statue of Lord Yang in front of the Memorial Hall. He stands firmly upright, and the crystal dew continuously flows on his smiling face—it can also be said that this is his expression of joy.</p>
<p>The faint bell sound destroys the students' laughter in their dreams—perhaps you can see it on everyone's face, perhaps a few of them have a bland attitude, then others will inevitably look at him strangely a few times.</p>
<p>When the short hand is pointing at nine o'clock, the bell rings again in everyone's eardrums. The athletes stopped their work, and the souls of the people who were reading were also involuntarily pulled into the auditorium.</p>
<p>The concert in China may be like this... chaotic... noisy... clamorous... cursing... booing... I simply don't understand what is called (music), let alone what such a (music) is.</p>
<p>Grandma Hua Hua near the school... children with runny noses... dolls wearing new clothes, and even old ladies wearing big floral shoes with their eyes tightly closed also came to participate in this grand event.</p>
<p>In the morning, the image that I felt deeply was a gentleman playing Chinese music like a pipa. His (shattered jade) tune was indeed rare.</p>
<p>I didn't want to go again in the afternoon, but I was encouraged by the thunderous shouts and entered the auditorium.</p>
<p>People are even more crowded, stacked on top of each other like a mountain of meat.</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>When I stepped in, I heard a few classmates making strange noises.</p>
<p>"What a erhu, hee...hee."</p>
<p>"The sanxian is nothing..."</p>
<p>"Boo...boo..."</p>
<p>"Pissing..."</p>
<p>I dare not trust my own judgment. It is a school that is holding a classmates' party. It is simply as chaotic as being in a Chinese theater.</p>
<p>In my observation, this grand event is cheap for the tallest and the shortest. The tallest person can see clearly by lifting his feet, and the shortest person can go to the front by passing under people's shoulders. The most unfortunate people are those of medium height. But when the petite and graceful ladies dance the Charleston and the innocent children sing lovely ballads, who is willing to succumb?</p>
<p>Therefore, the work of the shortest person is accelerated, and the tallest person also tries his best to lift his feet. People of medium height finally roared and stood up without haste under the curses of pigs.</p>
<p>They stood straight with thick skin, and no one could make their skin thinner and squat down. Maybe there will be—at least wait until the ladies performing on stage lift their feet high.</p>
<p>Chaos... clamor... noise... is what the Chinese call (concert). It is true that chaos is called liveliness by the Chinese. Chaos is what the Chinese call... (music)...</p>

<p>(Five Minutes of Enthusiasm) Although it is said to be one of the characteristics of our Chinese nation, it seems to be specifically referring to students. This is probably because they have won the view of foreigners for doing patriotic movements without thoroughly solving diplomatic problems and doing patriotic movements with a beginning but no end, so they have given our nation a nickname that is still in line with (Five Minutes of Enthusiasm). But if you try to check, which patriotic movement was not initiated and advocated by young students? Since the booming May Fourth Movement was initiated, the following (May 30th) (May 3rd) and other movements were not all initiated by students? Although the diplomatic department of the National Government handles its own negotiations, if it were not for the students across the country responding one after another to awaken their compatriots to demonstrate and parade, I am afraid that the general public would still be asleep in the drum and not know that my beloved China has suffered all kinds of bullying. There would probably not be such public opinion as a backing in diplomacy. Although the result is that various situations and academic relations make it impossible for students to continue their efforts and continue to work hard, and they have to stop, this is a passive stop, and it is another matter. But at the same time, there are many who stop automatically, because young people are full of blood, and their will is often easy to shake, starting with excitement and ending with disappointment. The so-called five minutes of enthusiasm cannot be easily denied or opposed. If you try to take a look at the groups organized by young students, especially the groups in schools, the most obvious news about a certain school can often be seen in newspapers (...Since the beginning of the school year, various extracurricular research groups such as the XX Club and the XX Association have sprung up like mushrooms after rain...) Don't say that you wish it longevity. Many of them have not even taken off their shells before they disappear. In other words, many groups are only seen to be busy with the opening ceremony. After the articles of association are passed, four dark words are conveniently attached to the supplementary rules (death). It is not intentional to slander students. Such facts are quite common. It is even more unnecessary to talk about publishing publications. Either the life is not long, or the purpose is not pure. They are willing to obliterate the bad and are willing to recognize thieves as fathers, advertising for a certain color and acting as a trumpet for a certain color. Or, they are just a group of leisure people who claim to be bored literati, making an appointment of three or five to publish some kind of publication or newspaper, specializing in creating cases with neurological sensitivity, mostly making fun of women and looking for women's happiness. What they study and contribute is only this. All of these are mostly unavoidable in various schools, but the degree is different. It is a pity to sacrifice the precious time of reading in the golden age on this kind of research. How can groups and publications of this kind be expected to last long? So, how can (five minutes of enthusiasm) not be crowned on the heads of young students? Now the booming patriotic movement of demonstration and parade is certainly not applicable, but a patriotic movement of research and academics is not allowed to be opposed or denied by anyone. Why don't we see students stand up to implement it? This has to make people doubt and be greatly disappointed. Of course, academic movement is not as simple and easy as demonstration and parade movement, but this academic patriotic movement does not necessarily have to be large-scale and needs to contact several schools to carry out. Just like the various groups mentioned above, they can seriously engage in dedicated academic research, pay attention to their own academic cultivation, and store talents for the country. Each student and each academic group can follow this pure purpose and move towards the bright and correct path. The Chinese nation is becoming more and more upward, and the education sector is glowing with strange light. It is not difficult to realize the potential.</p>
<p>Following the purposes and paths mentioned above, there are also groups that implement it, such as the Law Society of the Faculty of Law. Here is a brief introduction for reference by those who are engaged in organizing extracurricular groups. However, what I know is only seen in the publications issued by the society (Legal Light) and the news reports. Since the publication of the publication, the society has sent me a copy of each issue, so I feel more and more interested.</p>
<p>In the second issue, (The Past and Future of the Law Society) shows that although the society is only a bud that was issued at the end of last semester, the work results are not as naive as that. In the month that is about to end, it was still able to publish an issue of (Legal Light), invite a Dr. Lu to give a lecture, etc. This semester, such as the holding of discussion meetings, the continuation of publications, and the solicitation of lectures by celebrities and experts, the sincerity of the litigation practice, and the purity and serious research of the literary society and other purposes can be used as a model for general academic groups. Recently, I received and read the fifth issue of the publication, which includes Jia Liu's reading (Several Points to Discuss After the Opinion of the Central Political Conference on the Preliminary Issues of the Two Chapters of Relatives' Inheritance), Yi Xian's (What China Urgently Needs to Build), Zu Qu's (The Reasons for the Failure of My Country's Silk Industry), and Wang Tiehua's (What Kind of Literature and Art We Need). The content is very rich, but it is a pity that many long papers cannot be published in one issue due to space reasons. In this issue, such as Mr. Jia Liu's (Several Points to Discuss After Reading the Opinion of the Central Political Conference on the Preliminary Issues of the Two Chapters of Relatives' Inheritance) and Mr. Wang Tiehua's (What Kind of Literature and Art We Need) have not been published yet. We will wait and see for the next issue.</p>
<p>What China urgently needs to build is a concise and crisp text that uses the most economical writing to explain the meaning of revolution, the interrelationship between destruction and construction, and the equal importance of psychological construction and material construction. It also points out the reasons and realities of the National Government's failure to construct in one hand (We will not go far back into the past. Just in terms of the facts that have occurred in the most recent half year, the Northern Reorganizationists and the Western Hills Conference Xiao faction jointly formed a government with the Yan and Feng warlords to resist the Central Government. The war on the Jinghan Longhai Jinpu lines lasted for half a year, causing disasters to several provinces. In the south, the Zhang Gui army and the Guangdong army confronted each other in the Yongning area, and it has been unresolved for many years. The people in the war zone suffered unspeakable suffering. There are also the Communist troops ravaging the four provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui, the rampant bandits of Zhu Mao, Peng Huang, etc., the disturbances of the lake bandits in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the rebellion of Lu Xingbang, Zhou Zhiqun, etc. in Fujian. These disturbances made the government rush to quell the chaos, making it difficult to administer and impossible to build. People are unable to protect their lives, so how can they have the ability to operate businesses? Now that the military is pacified, there are thousands of things to be done. On the government side, it is certainly necessary to appease the local areas and stabilize social order to make the people's lives stable, but this is only passive relief. After all, there must be active construction to meet the hopes of the people. The current urgent need for construction is two: one is the construction of transportation infrastructure, and the other is the implementation of local autonomy). It is also divided into three types of transportation (1) ideological transportation (2) personal transportation (3) goods transportation. The implementation of local autonomy (4) also has a considerable contribution to the overall plan.</p>
<p>(The Reasons for the Failure of My Country's Silk Industry) First, the statistics on the declining export volume of China's silk industry in recent years (according to customs reports) and the investigation and statistics on the closure of silk factories in Shanghai and Wuxi and the unemployment of workers are presented. Then, the reasons for the failure are investigated. The reasons for the failure are roughly three (1) the oppression of Japanese silk (2) the lack of improvement of Chinese silk (3) silk factory operators mostly speculate.</p>
<p>In short, a group organized by some classmates outside of class has already made such a contribution. What is shown by all the students in the school should be even more promoted. I hope that the students in the society will continue to work hard to promote and develop it. Finally, I would like to thank the society for sending me (Legal Light) every issue.</p>
