<h3 id="c10">英國總選舉說 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>英政府自工黨執政後。順應潮流。努力於經濟工商各商政務之整理。當然不少進步。然而困難問題。亦時來襲。其中關乎財政最無辦法之工作失業救濟。問題。煤礦國有維持問題。雖經過不數次之苦心策劃。不數次之爭執風潮。而迄今仍成爲無法擺脫之諸問題中重要爭點。政府與議會黨派之意見。益見參差。此亦時代環境使然。而難以衝破者也。</p>
<p>昨日倫敦電。謂主張帝國自由貿易政策之某爵士。將設一新政黨又謂英相麥克唐納已與獨立工黨脫離關係。今日世界社之倫敦訊。又謂英相將俟倫敦軍縮會議畢後。擬舉行總選舉。其原因則以困難問題旣多。内部意見不一致工黨方面。多左翼分子。恒露反對政府態度每遇難題議會中時起爭執如麥荊納稅則案。所謂極端自由黨與保護貿易派。已劇爭不已。况復加以失。業問題中之保險案。煤礦問題中之稅率案等。屢遭反對黨抨擊。故欲以總選舉訴之國人。原因大要不。外乎是。惟此總選舉之說。在今日僅係一種揣測之。詞。將來是否實現。不能懸斷。然以此種種。大問題當前。多關於勞賣切身之利害。而近日國際貿易狀况之不良如是。國内經濟整理之不易如是。黨派中左翼勢力日見增長如是新舊潮流日見衝動如是。所謂時代環境。實足使當局。益感應付之困難。問題爭點。愈覺不易消弭。則或竟出於實行總選舉之途。亦未可知也。</p>

<h3 id="c95">瞿氏檢字方原文（昨）瞿重福 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>爲了檢字麻煩的緣故、我國之讀書人對於一字的意義及來歷、往往不求了解、我國之文化進步已不知扼止了多少、豈非一個很有關係的問題麽、</p>
<p>王雲五先生於東方雜誌二十二卷十二號中說道、用科學方法改良漢字檢查法者、有范尙人氏、Ｉ·Ｍ·Ｃａｌｌｅｒｙ）布列地氏、（Ｐ·Ｐｏｌｅｔｔｉ華胥留氏（Ｗ·Ｐ·Ｗａｓｓｉｌｉｅｗ）魯森堡氏（Ｏ·Ｒｏｓｅｎｂｅｒｇ）高夢旦氏、林玉堂氏、黄希聲氏、何公敢氏、等八個辦法、及王先生自已的檢字方法、共爲九個辦法、那篇論文是我在美國哥侖比亞大學中國圖書館中檢得的、我讀了那篇論文以後、每日有閒即私自比較這九種方法的利弊、一一演繹其排法、一一揣摩其原理、</p>
<p>我的新檢字方法、先將求的字一剖而爲兩半、謂之（初一半）與一餘一半）、再行檢查（初一半）首一筆和末一半的號碼、與（餘一半）首一筆和末一筆的號碼、照此排來、每一個字必有四個號碼、號碼旣多、所有的空位自然亦多了、</p>
<p>我之新的檢字方法最小的號碼爲○○○○、最大的號碼爲九九九九、從○○○○數至九九九九共有一萬個（一○、○○○）、號碼即有一萬個（一○、○○○）空位、以常用一萬餘字排列於此一萬個空位之中、若使排法得當、每一空位不過有一個字、我以後排字的時光、每次參考康熙字典、每次覺得我的辦法（即將每字分爲兩半）是最適當的、因爲我國之字、百個中、九十九個是有偏旁的、是可以剖分爲兩半的、我從此知道我不是進行於錯誤之途徑上、我併且自已相信、若然我願意於此種方法用力加以研究、我的檢字方法、不日即可實現的了、</p>
<p>我最初研究這個方法的時候、覺得各種筆畫應該給與的號碼、極難分配、幸而在學校讀書的時候、略爲學了一些解柝幾何、我於是立刻應用曲線比較原理、費了許多時光、方將筆劃的號碼排定、現在我將每種號碼所代替的筆法演述如下、</p>
<p>我的檢字方法、將各種筆畫分做十種號碼、即一、二、二、四、五、六、七、八、九、○、或（一（（二）（三）（四）、（五）（六）、（七）（八）（九）、（十（檢字的時先每一個字都假定有這十種筆畫、每類的筆畫都用一位的號數來代表、所以一點即（一）一鈎即（○）毫無疑義、第十個號碼是（○）代表有鈎的筆畫、亦可用以代表缺少的筆畫、</p>
<p>我檢字法筆畫順序底大旨、就是點畫直劈四個大類、其先後順序適合（從簡單至複雜）的自然公例、至於我的十種號碼（一）即是點、點用作第一個的號碼、因點是各種筆畫的起點、無論那一種爲筆畫皆可由點而起的、（二）（三）（四）用作平畫、以及類於平畫的筆畫、爲什麽必要三個號位做平畫、因爲平畫的用處最多、在中國字首末兩筆、要占很大的一部、（五）（六）即爲短直與長直、點的下爲畫、畫的下當然是直了、（七）（八）用來代表劈、劈共分爲兩種、直劈（七）同斜劈（八）直劈就是向下作七十五角度的、斜劈就是向下作四十五角度的、挑（七）附於直劈的中間因爲他的角度傾斜恰正和直劈相同、不過寫的方向不同罷了、直劈和斜劈是很容易分别的、因爲這兩劈的傾斜度數不同、而且他的長短亦不同、直劈通常是很長的斜劈是很短的、（捺）附於斜劈的中間、因爲捺從左手看來亦成四十五度的角、（九）（十）是總合以上所有的幾種筆畫、（九）用來代表灣曲的筆畫、（○）用來代表末端有鈎的筆畫、無論何種筆畫、中間有顯明底灣曲的、皆作爲（九）、無論灣曲不灣曲、末端有一鈎的皆作爲（○）、譬如（几）字的末一筆、　這筆也灣曲也有鈎、那麽這筆的號碼是（○）、並不是（九）、（○）有時亦用來代表空虚的筆畫譬如（事）字這一個字無論如何分不成兩半、道樣中間的兩個欵難筆畫、便用兩個圈來代表、以上所說的就是十種筆畫的順序、這十種筆畫都是很簡單很天然的、所以很容易記得、我並不應用一個複筆、因爲複筆即是複雜、</p>
<p>此時應該說明、我所定的（短畫）即一畫之不足一字之長者、（長畫即滿足一字之長者、譬如（士）字第一畫則爲長畫、第二畫則爲短畫、（木）字之一畫爲長、（林）字之二畫爲短、其餘即可按此類推、</p>
<p>（短直）就是不足一字之長的直、（長直）就是滿足一字之長的直、例如（固）字的一直則爲長、（彳）字的一直則爲短、</p>
<p>讀者如欲使用我的檢字方法、必先將欲求之字、分裂而爲兩半、先檢查此字第一半、首筆與末筆之號碼、再檢查此字餘一半、首筆與末之號碼、我們再舉幾個例以說明之、</p>
<p>五○五○、號三二三一碼、三一八一檢、一○九四字、五七三一法、一二七一爲、五二四八最、一一二五新、四一三三式、五二四八最、二一五○利、八五三八便、八二八一的、三一八一檢、一○九四字、五七三一法、</p>
<p>依照這種方法每一個字即有一個字的號碼、按照號碼順序將各字一一排列於字典之中、檢字的時候、各字都有一定不移的地位、（未完）</p>

<p>滿堂賓朋王氏現年四十八歲、山東　城縣人、曾任第二屆中央執行委員職、闔家卜居法租界福理履路一百二十號弄第三號門牌、另闢會客所于邁而西愛路霞飛坊北首沿馬路三百十四號、王氏每日離家外出後、除拜訪友人外、即在該處時間居多、前日入晚未幾、至該處訪晤王氏者、達二十餘人、聞當時與王氏同屆之中委王法勸氏亦在座、衆人談至十一時許、始各興罷散歸、比時祇有黄埔第一期畢業生產東人潘行健、（曾任總政治部宣傳大隊隊長）與河北人趙林相、（年三十歲亦黄埔畢業生）兩人獨留未去、與氏叙談良久、（按潘行健昨報誤爲湯德健趙林相漏一相字、特附王於此）</p>
<p>王樂平氏遺影</p>
<p>屋外男屍王潘趙三人正在密談之際、時正午夜、突聞屋外南首、隠約槍聲一響、當時亦未加注意、三人復談如故、詎響聲未幾、即有一捕房西捕乘脚踏車巡經該處、瞥見三五九號門首電桿下倒斃一人、道傍血跡殷然、隠約可辨、西捕遂停車察看、見死者左胸前中一彈、血流未止、當即呼喚霞飛坊之守門捕看守、西捕返身飛報捕房、</p>
<p>聯珠槍聲西捕歸報捕房、霞飛坊之守門捕、正站立道旁看守、乃未及十分鐘、三一四號屋内槍聲密如聯珠約歷數分鐘始寂、未幾、捕房派往查勘路旁男屍之探捕均至當即巡聲查究、詎方抵三一四號門口、瞥見一守門華捕、臥於門傍呻吟、立即入内查看、但見樓上下屍身狼藉、血汚四濺、探捕見而大驚、立即飛報總巡捕房特别機關、復由大批中西探捕趕往、詳加考查</p>
<p>守門捕言旋據同屋蘇幼溪與受傷守門捕何培之（鎭江南鄉人、年三十四歲、向做米業、因失業後、來滬爲守門捕）云、當晚十一時三十分左右、王潘趙三人在樓上談話、男僕康瑞齋在樓下扶梯口數錢、先由前門竄入暴徒四人、進門時即向何捕開一槍、彈一左手、何捕性甚機警、當即應聲而倒、臥伏不動、四暴徒即抵樓梯口、適見康僕、亦向之轟擊一槍、彈中左額、立時倒地斃命、此時復由後門奔入三人、一齊登樓、向王氏等三人、聯珠狙擊、衆暴徒見目的已達、遂下樓一哄而散、此即當時肇禍大槪情形也、</p>
<p>死傷處理當衆探捕登樓查勘時、王潘兩人、已氣絶多時、趙林相伏地呼痛衆探捕遂先將三屍身、用炭精攝影、嗣即將死傷者、分送仁濟醫院、轉送金神父路廣慈醫院救治、及同仁輔元堂騐屍所候騐、並在屋中檢得彈壳多枚、聞均係盒子砲彈、至於路旁男屍、亦同時舁堂候騐、聞當時法領事亦聞訊親自趕往踏勘、以昭愼重、</p>
<p>蛛絲馬跡、當探捕檢視時、在路旁男屍身畔、抄出名片名丁寳申、年二十歳、並福煦路二九六至二九八號天益公寓信封一只、署名黄幹臣、本報記者隨即至該公寓詢問、據云、本月七日確有一名徐州人黄幹臣者、率同兩人、至該寓租定樓下第五號房間、每月租金言明大洋十一元、詎黄來時、即晤本月四日先住該寓樓上十九號之貴州人梁志雲·梁共來兩人、其一未署名、黄之房内、每日有一女人來訪、深夜始去、黄與梁等、於前晚七時一同外出、迄未見一人歸來、隨由該寓派人至同仁輔元堂察看的係黄某</p>

<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>幼年時會讀英但福氏（魯濱遜飄記與梁任公先生　　（十五小豪傑。）往往發爲遐想。</p>
<p>旣想效魯濱遜飄流絶島。又想追隨十五小豪傑探險蠻荒。那時豪氣凌雲。眞的不可一世。乃曾幾何時。年紀一年年增多。家累一年年加重。而豪氣也一年年的消减下去。久處於這錦天繡地的上海。簡直已腐化到了極點、旣没有讀完萬卷書。也不想走萬里路了。最近聽說有謝憤生葛文烈劉漢僑婁俠莊學本徐蔭棠許增祥梁達新姜錫錫傑諸君。組織了一個全國步行團。將在五年間走遍全國。百折不回。這樣的壯舉。眞是從來所未有。不由得使我怦然心動。自恨不能擺脫一切。跟他們同去。前晚我在餞别宴席上。又曾親聆諸君子的偉論。知道他們的組織很完備。志願很偉大。此去將考察各地歷史地理民情風俗語言文學經濟實業敎育交通等狀况。並蒐集其證物。以供社會作學術上與建設上的參考。準備以九人的血汗精力。與任何艱困危險相搏戰。期在得到最後的勝利。滿載而歸。這種新中華新青年的大無畏精神。是値得我們提倡舉崇拜的。今天是諸君子出發之日。敢以一瓣心香。祝諸君子的健康與成功。</p>

<p>— 君碩</p>
<p>邇來我國學子。專究心於科學。致國學不免有日漸衰微之慨。乃歐西各國。反多服膺我國國學者。其間以法蘭西爲最。我國四部重要之籍。繙譯聞已不少。近聞新自巴黎歸國之某博士云。法人於我國文學家。尤推崇太倉之吳梅村先生。已有極鄭重之表示。云他日當組一團體。來至中國。訪先生珂里。爲開一三百周紀念會。其崇拜已極。果成事實。空前之盛舉也。今按太倉顧師軾所譔吳梅村先生年譜。生於明萬曆三十七年五月二十日。卒於清康熙十年十二月二十四日。自康熙十一年起。至今民國十九年。爲二百五十九年。去三百周紀念之期。尙須遲之四十一年。屆時開會。恐創此議者。或未必人人咸得躬逢其盛。是不能無望於後來者之善承前志矣。五漁洋詩云。白髮塡詞吳祭酒。袁子才詩云。生逢天寳亂離年。妙詠香山長慶篇。就使吳兒心木石。也應一讀一纏綿。其價値固可知也。先生名偉業。字駿公。梅村其别號。二十三歲中會元。殿試一甲二名。榜眼及第。入翰林。制詞曰。陸機詞賦。早年獨步江東。蘇軾文章。一日喧傳都下。當時以爲無愧。至其入清朝。官祭酒。爲溧陽海寗兩相國。曁總督馬國柱所薦。惟時有司敦迫。二親流涕。攝使就道。恐抗朝命。遭不測也。先生上督府馬公詩云。慚愧薦賢蕭相國。召平只合守瓜邱。又自歎云。誤盡平生是官。棄家容易變名難。乃臨終感詞則云。脫屣妻孥非易事。竟一錢不値何須說。先生以不忍累親而出。顧云戀戀妻子。用心可云至苦。今外國人猶崇拜之。不獨文詞益顯。其心亦大白矣。</p>

<p>— 稽覲</p>
<p>友人許君。留法多年。專攻機械之學。頃據上月份通訊云。法人天性好險。其震天撼地之事業。每不憚竭其智力以經營之。若孟塞尼墜道。蘇彝士運河。巴拿馬海峽。此尤　瑩大者。最近鑒於非屬之撒哈拉沙漠。亘有三千餘里。地土乾燥。终歲不雨。爲殖民上一大障礙。迭經學者研究。遂有格斯奈端大學理科敎授洛爾脫氏發明最新人工降雨球。其法先用一種最冷之瓦斯。放入橡皮球中。下端繫之以紐。再用電氣輸送。任其騰空而上。久之球因紐轉。漸自破裂。瓦斯則乘罅而出。瀰漫空際。如雲霧狀。頓使上層之日生熱。驟然减少。其時空中稀微之熱氣。與球中濃重之冷氣。兩相混合。遂成極細之水點。濛濛而下。雖來勢不大。亦足膏黍苗而潤土壤也。</p>
<p>上年冬季。洛氏親往撒哈拉試騐。自上午十時起開放此球。至十一時。恍惚烟霧迷濛。惟兩點尙未下降。乃復加足電力。直向空中放射。及至下午一時以後。始見濃雲密布。天日無光。沛然下雨。一里之内。無不旣沾旣足。此第一次之試騐。厥後在左近維斯脫地方。作二次三次之試騐。效率較著。且雨點細密而匀。有能普及至四五里以外。洛氏喜甚。以爲十年以内。將此一塊廣漠無垠之曠土。一變而爲利用厚生之沃區。可斷定也。惟須多植森林。則天氣地質。倶有變化。埃及沙漠。曩時一年一雨者。近已一季一雨。將來可至一月一雨。世界物質文明之進化。又安見科學之智力。不足以奪造化之工耶。</p>

<p>— 春華</p>
<p>無論何人。殆無不有特殊之嗜好。就其人之嗜好以判定其人之性特。實爲最準確之測騐。予爲一庸碌之人。半生所遭。無足演繹。而予之嗜好。有頗可得而言者。於食物。予喜鹹酸而惡甘。讀書時。喜讀靈妙小文而惡高文典册。比年極喜勸電影。於西國明星。最嗜珍妮蓋諾。彼所主演之名片。如（七重天）（日出）（安琪兒）（四大天王）等。感予甚深。彼之技術。原非絶高。第不識何故。牽縈吾靈感之力量乃絶洪。於舞臺劇予。則數年在北平。嗜程艶秋特甚。近年在滬。以値夜間工作。觀劇之機會極少。程來。予僅能於星期日一顧之耳。唱片中。予最喜聆荀慧生各片。慧生之唱。深得作文之旨。纒綿欲絶。紆徐而妍。他伶所灌之片。多無比味外味也。更言讀報。予每忽於軍國大事而瀏覽社會新聞。幾可一字弗遺。上海社會無奇不有。報紙選載。僅其一綾。予讀之已覺得醰然意足。又昔年予沉迷雀牌之戲。百誡不聽。至爲文讚美厥戲。以爲雀牌之構造配置。旣有數學上之趣味。又合乎美學與力學。取捨應戰之間。復饒有心理學之研究。且周密無弊。可稱爲世界賭品中之聖。近年稍閱世故。嗜之已淡。而於圍棋又復愛好甚至。信乎予爲一最無克制力之庸人也。</p>

<h3 id="c227">婚姻年齡問題卓君 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>婚齡問題、不專是婚姻問題裏一個重要問題並且是一個社會問題和國家民族文化俱有若干關係的重要問題、泰西各國在新近百十年以來、就很注意這個問題了、不過我們中國對於這個重要問題、注意它的人還不多、依新近日本婦人雜誌的紀載、說男女對於婚齡上面、頗有繼長增高的趨勢、並且那繼長增高的推動力、即是繼長增高的生活程度、日本向亦盛行早婚、早現在似乎已經把早婚的習尙都打破了。我們中國除了一些文化較爲昌明的地方、還是盛行早婚的、早婚的弊害、人所共知、此篇爲節省篇幅起見、不容多贅、然而婚姻這一回事、男女的年齡總須得不相上下、如果男的年齡比女的小得太多、或男的尙未發育而女的却已完全發育的了。就生理上說起來、極其應該有糾正之必要、</p>
<p>據陳嘯仙君在山西的觀察說、民國初年的時候、山西就盛行一種男女年齡懸殊很遠的婚姻、他說、有一次到運城的鄉間去、親眼看見一種奇怪的情形、那個做新嫁娘的女子、大約總在二十一二歲的光景、而那個新郎却是勉强不過十歲左右的男孩子、後來回到太原、問了好幾個朋友、纔知道不但晋南有這種風俗、即晋北如大同五台各處也有這種風俗的、陳君又說、民國初年固如此、民國十三年再到山西去、還看見許多次像那麽樣的情形、</p>
<p>據王會川君說、安徽省的東南鄉爲歙縣所轄的地方、有呌做長標莊的、男孩子在十一二歲的時候、往往就和女子結婚了、而且和他結婚的女子、至少總得比他大八九歲或甚至於大十來歲、又說、新嫁娘歸寗、新郎例須同行、女家設宴、例須請新郎坐首席、新郎因爲乳臭未除、笑話百出、有時看見門外有小孩子擲石爲戲踢揵子、它却不知道身爲新郎、居然離座去同門外的孩子玩耍、</p>
<p>上說二例、或者是特殊的現象吧、然而無獨有偶、何其一至於斯耶、我恐怕這種情形、不僅是山西和安徽而已、别省有没有這種情形、不敢臆測、可是這種情形至於今日還有表現的、該不僅山西安徽的特殊現象吧、雖然、這種情形、並非安徽山西全省都有的、總之、以十一二歲的男孩子就和女子結婚、已經是不對了、並且與結婚的女子比他大十歳左右、那是尤其不對了、我們翻閱美國麻省的婚姻統計、始终找不出象我上面所舉的那樣的報告、在一八六四年、美國麻省的婚娶、均齡、男子爲二七、女子爲二○、七、在一八九○年、男子爲二七·二、女子爲二四·四、在一八九五年、男子爲二六·九、女子爲二四·四、在一九○一年、男子爲二七·三、女子爲二四·六、他們的统計、是否十分靠得住、我們却不敢說、但我們就他的統計看起來、他對可以相信未滿二十歲的男子、絶對的不和女了結婚、又我們就他的統計看來、男女的相差年齡、總不過是四五歲上下、女子年齡大於男子、未嘗不可以互相配偶、但是以發育未全或未成年的男子和已經發育或已成年的女子結婚、誠爲國民衛生的中梗、如果滑稽的一點說、那豈不是要弄出笑話麽、</p>
<p>不錯、在法國的婚姻統計中、往往有男女的年齡相差在二十左右的、然而他們却是遲婚的缘故、並不曾有我們山西安徽那種的現象、柏林的一九○六年的婚姻统計、六年爲五十五歲左右、而婦年恒在三十五歲左右的、亦頗不少、原來夫年高於妻年、這是現代的一般現象、可是他們的統計中、决其没有一個十歲上下的男子匹配一個二十來往歲的女子的情形呢、我們又看法國巴黎的婚姻統計、覺得婦女年齡高於丈夫的、不滿百分之十、而夫婦年齡相若的、要居了百分之三順至四、更看英國倫敦的婚姻統計、男子和女子結婚的年齡、大槪男子爲二十五歲以上的居多數、女子爲二十四歲以上居多數、可見以十來歲的男子和女子結婚、那眞是一種的特殊現象、</p>
<p>有人說、印度半島一带的地方、男女俱在八九歲左右就結婚了、不錯、這是印度常有的事、但是印度跨處熱带、氣候特别温暖、男女的發育、都來得特别快、八九歲的時候就結婚、原不足稀罕、恐怕我們中國的十歲左右的男子、未見得就發育完全了、更爲匹配一個發育完全的女子、似乎於生理上有所未合嗎、</p>
<p>這裏還有一點意思、不得不附带說的、就是一個男子或一個女子的結婚底遲早是和在外地位是有關係的、因爲處在某一種地位、而又不甚好的時候、他們的婚嫁年齡、就不得不比較的早一點、反是處得地位比較的高一點、婚娶年齡就往往也高一點、例如英倫的礦工絲織工等等、男的始娶年齡、約在二十四歲至二十六歲之間、女的始嫁年齡、約在二十二歲至二十四歲之間、藝術家及店員等、男子則須三十六歲到二十八歲、他們方纔肯結婚、女子到二十四歲至二十六歳方纔肯嫁、像律師醫生等等、係有專業的、總要到二十六歲至三十多歲纔結婚、女子到二十六歲至二十八九歲纔嫁</p>
<p>據新出版的生活（第五卷第十號）底日本通訊說、日本的女子、總要到二十二三歲纔嫁、男子總要到二十六七歲纔娶可見男女的嫁娶、是要循着生理的原則的、我們中國内地、差不多還是受宗法制度的支配、做老子的、巴不得兒子趁早結了婚、得以趁早抱孫子、不問他的兒子是否完全發育、更不問給他兒子配偶的那個女子、如果年紀太大、有否影響或戕賊他兒子的發育、</p>
<p>末了、我要申明一句、我這篇東西、没有一點系统、對於婚齡問題、也没有具體的貢獻、可是我這篇東西、旨在揭破我們中國内地那一種特殊的婚娶情形、願負有指導勸化的人、想個妥善的方法去制止、</p>

<p>Important Domestic Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e2">Jiang's Telegram to Yan Xishan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Hoping that Yan will take the lead in fulfilling the agreement to send Feng Yuxiang abroad... and be responsible for the implementation of the disbandment resolutions.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Headquarters released Jiang’s telegram to Yan Xishan on the 19th, which reads: “Brother Baixiong, Commander-in-Chief Yan of Taiyuan, I have received your kind telegram. I did not immediately reply to your original telegram because I, Zhongzheng, believe that revolutionary nation-saving is an obligation, and we must not abandon our responsibility to encourage chaos and help disputes. As for the Central Government’s efforts towards peaceful unification, it has no choice but to use force to suppress the rebels. I did not expect that with the deep friendship and understanding we have always shared, the result would be like this. Zhongzheng can only feel deeply ashamed and regretful, and has nothing more to say. Furthermore, the three presidents, Hu, Tan, and Wang, have continued to offer sincere advice. If you, brother, do not consider it an unpleasant truth, it is not too late to rein in at the edge of the cliff. It is not necessary for Zhongzheng to reiterate. Zhongzheng has been silently reflecting on his faults in recent days. Why was I unable to receive your timely guidance and correction in the past when I failed the Party and the country? And why do you suddenly now issue such serious reprimands, like thunderbolts, insisting that Zhongzheng immediately abandon the important responsibilities given by the Party and the country, to prove the rumors spread outside that you, brother, are taking advantage of others' failures and have no choice but to personally come out to overthrow Jiang? I am ashamed that my sincerity is not trusted, and how dare I be indignant and increase my guilt? Moreover, I, Zhongzheng, requested Minister Yang to return to Jin on the date above and urged Mr. Cilong to come to Nanjing to mediate the overall situation. You can inquire about the situation in Nanjing and the hopes I hold from Minister Yang in detail. Please do not lightly believe the slanderous words of those who sow discord. Zhongzheng has also received repeated reports stating that you, brother, have decided to wage war against the Central Government. All commanders-in-chief and commanders of various routes have been appointed. Furthermore, you have forcibly deployed the Second Army as the main force to take Wuhan directly from Zhengzhou and Luoyang, and a large part to invade Xiangyang and Wancheng. Central organs of the Ping-Han Railway Bureau and the Beiping Telegraph Bureau have been placed under surveillance by troops, and forcibly seized with force. Furthermore, telegrams sent by the Beiping Pacification Headquarters are being inspected. In various counties of Hebei, vehicles and mules are being requisitioned urgently, like shooting stars. Zhongzheng did not dare to question you based on this. Instead, I used your telegram as your words. You swore to obey the Central Government's orders, which is excellent. However, the Central Government entrusted you with important responsibilities, and never allowed you to lightly abandon them yourself. Zhongzheng and the presidents of the various institutes have earnestly persuaded you, hoping that you will continue to dedicate yourself to the Party and the country. If you truly have the sincerity to obey orders, then please immediately retract the statements of resigning and retreating. Otherwise, even if you swear to obey orders, I fear that the day your mobilization order is completed will be the day you telegraph your resignation. And the resignation telegram will be announced in the morning, and the disaster of war will break out in the evening. This is using concession as a pretext for competition, and not hesitating to become a sinner to the Party and the country. Speaking of this, Zhongzheng is truly shuddering with fear. Furthermore, I must say this to you, brother: Our revolution should involve obedience to the orders of the Party and the country in public, and emphasis on personal integrity in private. If the Party and the country do not allow me to retreat, I cannot arbitrarily say I will retreat. This is what those who obey orders should know. Integrity is the foundation of concession. Without integrity, all so-called concession is false. You, brother, and Huanzhang have a bond of kinship and are as close as brothers. Your collaboration has been even longer than that between Zhongzheng and you, brother. In August and September of last year, the Central Government repeatedly urged Huanzhang to travel abroad. The travel expenses of 200,000 yuan were also allocated and requested to be transferred by you so that Huanzhang could depart early. Then the war in the Northwest could have been avoided. Unfortunately, you firmly agreed with Huanzhang to travel together in the past and restricted Huanzhang's actions later. When Mr. Liu and Mr. Jiang came, the Central Government was sincerely cordial. However, the telegram about the Northwest Army sending troops to invade the east was suddenly issued from Taiyuan. Even now, thinking about it, there is still lingering pain. The past cannot be pursued. Today, you, brother, should take the lead in fulfilling the agreement to send Huanzhang abroad, restore his freedom, and earnestly be responsible for implementing the resolutions of the disbandment conference to show great faith to the world. The world will also believe that you, brother, are open and upright, and have always been a revolutionary. Obeying orders is not hypocritical, and the rumor of inciting the Second Army is indeed slander. All doubts will be dispelled, and the hearts of the people will be at peace. This is truly the blessing of peaceful unification. I hope you will consider it. I am grateful for your trust, so I dare to frankly state a few things in my personal capacity. I hope you will observe my foolishness and recognize my sincerity. Your brother, Jiang Zhongzheng, Hao. (Special telegram on the 19th)"</p>
<h3 id="e3">Yan Xishan's Statement <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yan sent another telegram to Chairman Jiang, stating that if the previous telegram contained anything offensive, he may be punished as he deems fit, and he would obey. The north remains peaceful, and there is no sign of war preparation here to date. (Reuters telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Last night, Yan sent two telegrams, one in reply to the kind telegram from the three presidents and one in reply to the kind telegram from Jiang, saying that his original telegram had not been replied to, and he missed him very much. When this telegram arrived, the commentary in the Tianjin newspapers became more moderate, and people's hearts were also at ease. Furthermore, Yan’s telegram to the three presidents advocated that the resolutions of the disbandment conference should be followed, and that forming a marshal's office or a council of veteran elders would be more than enough to quell the chaos, and he would continue to lead the troops in surrender. (Special telegram on the 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Yang Zhaotai Arrived in Beiping Yesterday <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Departed for Jin that evening</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yang Zhaotai arrived in Beiping at 1:30 PM today and immediately went to the Central Hotel, stating that he came under the orders of Jiang to dispel all rumors.

Therefore, Zhongzheng and Yang have telegraphed Shang Zuoyi to make contact, and have also prepared a car with the Ping-Han Railway Bureau, and will go to Taiyuan this evening. The date of return to Nanjing is yet to be determined. (Special telegram on the 19th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Bi Guangyue, Chief Secretary of Shi Yousan, left Beiping for Jin last night. (Special telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Minister of the Interior Yang Zhaotai arrived in Tianjin at 10 AM on the 19th. Military, political, police, and constitutional leaders all came to the station to welcome him. Reporters boarded the car to interview him, but due to the large number of people, they could not talk. He waved and wrote a few words, saying that the mission of this trip is extremely simple. He was ordered by Chairman Jiang to go to Jin to persuade President Zhao Daiwen to return to Nanjing together. He does not intend to stay in Beiping, and will go to Jin as soon as there is a car. (19th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e10">The British General Election Theory <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Since the Labour Party came to power in the British government, it has followed the trend and strived to reorganize various commercial and political affairs in the economic and industrial sectors. There has been significant progress, of course. However, difficult problems also arise from time to time. Among them, the unemployment relief problem, which is most unsolvable in terms of finance, and the coal mine nationalization maintenance problem, although they have undergone painstaking planning and numerous disputes and waves, have remained important points of contention in the unresolved problems to this day. The opinions of the government and parliament parties have become increasingly divergent. This is also due to the times and environment, and it is difficult to break through.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram from London said that a certain earl who advocated the imperial free trade policy would establish a new political party. It also said that British Prime Minister MacDonald had severed relations with the Independent Labour Party. Today's London news from the World Society also said that the British Prime Minister plans to hold a general election after the London Disarmament Conference. The reason is that there are many difficult problems, and internal opinions are inconsistent. On the Labour Party side, there are many left-wing elements who constantly reveal their opposition to the government's attitude. Whenever there are difficult problems, disputes arise in parliament, such as the McKinley tariff case. The so-called extreme free party and protection trade party have been engaged in fierce disputes. Moreover, with the insurance case in the unemployment problem and the tax rate case in the coal mine problem, they have been repeatedly criticized by the opposition party. Therefore, they want to appeal to the people through a general election. The main reason is nothing more than this. However, this theory of a general election is only a conjecture at present. Whether it will be realized in the future cannot be definitively judged. However, with such major problems facing us, many of them are related to the vital interests of labor, and the current state of international trade is so bad, the domestic economic reorganization is so difficult, the power of the left-wing forces in the parties is growing daily, and the new and old trends are constantly colliding. The so-called times and environment are truly enough to make the authorities feel increasingly difficult to cope with. The points of contention on the problems are becoming increasingly difficult to eliminate. Then, it may even come to the path of implementing a general election. This is also unknown.</p>

<h3 id="e58">French Political Turmoil Impacts the Work of the Naval Conference <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th: Following the outbreak of political turmoil in France, the French Chief Delegate did not attend the Naval Conference. As a result, little progress was made in the conference today. However, other delegates continued to discuss matters. In the afternoon, the British Prime Minister met with the Italian Foreign Minister and the US Secretary of State at the House of Commons. It is reported that the Italian Foreign Minister has disclosed the content of Italy's memorandum, which will soon be delivered to all delegates and made public. Once this document is submitted to the conference, the figures from all countries will be complete, and the conference will be able to determine the tonnage of various types of ships that each country should possess based on it.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th: The Naval Conference has nearly stalled because key members of the French delegation have returned to Paris. It must wait until a new French cabinet is formed before it can continue with important matters. Currently, the delegates in the conference are only engaging in informal talks, and their records are being sent to the French government.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Content of Italy's Declaration on Military Reduction <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>To Be Officially Released Soon</p>
<p>Tsūshin, London, 18th: It is reported that Italy's statement on military reduction has been drafted and will be released in the form of a declaration. The contents are as follows: (1) Italy expresses its support for the naval holiday plan regarding the construction of battleships, as the plan was originally proposed based on the proposal of Prime Minister Mussolini. (2) Italy supports the abolition of submarines and intends to abolish all submarines, but with two conditions: (A) other countries must also abolish all submarines; (B) all countries must abolish battleships. Both of the above must be fully implemented. (3) Italy is willing to acknowledge the required figures expressed in the French proposal. However, it is regrettable that the required amount is as high as 720,000 tons. It is hoped that France will state that it can reduce this amount for the sake of balancing with other countries. If this assurance is given, Italy will be very satisfied. (4) Italy insists that the real strength of the Italian fleet must be equal to that of the most powerful country in continental Europe. This is the final decision, and it is hereby declared. (5) Italy is willing to agree to any proposal that can truly achieve the purpose of military reduction. (6) Italy will absolutely not sign any treaty that violates the above spirit. This is specifically stated here. In other words, Italy's position is that while it supports the abolition of battleships and submarines, the complete abolition of submarines is conditional on the complete abolition of battleships, and the overall strength of the navy must always be maintained at an equal level with France.</p>
<h3 id="e60">The New French Cabinet Is Still Difficult to Produce <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 19th: French President Doumergue met with various important politicians today. The most watched figure was Poincaré. Poincaré seemed to be in good health, staying at the Presidential Palace for about half an hour. However, his friends said that Poincaré's health was not strong enough and he would not be able to take on difficult tasks within a few months. Poincaré himself is also unwilling to take on political affairs again. Former cabinet member Piérard said upon leaving the Presidential Palace that he could not say for sure that the political turmoil could be resolved.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Paris, 18th: People in Congress do not take seriously the reports that Tardieu may again invite Briand to serve as Foreign Minister. Their comments on the current situation seem to indicate that the composition of the new government will either be a coalition of the left and center factions, excluding the Marin faction, or the Socialist Party. The main figures in this combination would be Briand, Chautemps, Caillaux, and Sarraut.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Japanese General Election Voting Ends Today <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The Ruling Party's Final Efforts</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 19th: The 19th is the final day of the general election. The Minseito Party issued an encouraging telegram to all officially recognized candidates in the name of President Hamaguchi, stating that the decision of victory or defeat lies in the last vote, and urging all party members to actively campaign until the end of the voting time tomorrow.</p>
<p>Inukai Rushes Around Tirelessly</p>
<p>Tsūshin, Tokyo, 19th: The Minseito Party plans to attack the enemy's base in one fell swoop. On the 17th, leaders such as Eguchi, Matsuda, Inoue, and Nagai jointly went to Okayama to attend several speaking engagements, attacking the Seiyukai Party's policies. As a result, the Seiyukai faction in the county was caught off guard and sent a long telegram to President Inukai for help. Inukai had originally planned to return to Tokyo after finishing his speech in Nagoya City last night, but after receiving the telegram, he changed his plans and went to Okayama to hold speaking engagements in Okayama City and Kurashiki City.</p>
<p>Observations on the Election of Various Factions</p>
<p>Tsūshin: According to the unanimous observation of various cabinet members, the number of seats won by each faction will be 235 to 240 for the Minseito Party, and around 200 for the Seiyukai Party. The government is implementing so-called "live ammunition warfare" in various places with only one day left for voting, and is not swayed by the opposition party's malicious propaganda and obstruction. It is making every effort to expose those who violate the election laws in order to ensure the fairness of the election. In particular, it is severely cracking down on physical crimes and adopting a decisive and strict penalty policy for bribery. At yesterday's cabinet meeting, Minister of Justice Watanabe gave a full explanation regarding the judiciary's strict policy.</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press: As of the evening of the 18th, according to news received by the Minseito Party headquarters from various locations, the expected number of seats that the Minseito Party is sure to win is roughly as follows: Minseito 223, Seiyukai 129, Shamin Party 4, Taishuto Party 1, Kakushinto Party 2, Kokuto Party 2, Neutral Party 5.</p>
<p>Preventing Election Abstentions</p>
<p>Tsūshin: With election voting imminent tomorrow, the government has reissued a circular to local officials to provide various conveniences to company employees, laborers, and other common people so that they can freely exercise their pure vote in order to prevent abstentions.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Mori's Bold Words Amidst Busyness</p>
<p>Tsūshin: With all the executives going to the regions to campaign, only Secretary-General Mori remained at the Seiyukai Party headquarters, commanding the entire line. In the midst of his busy schedule, he made the bold statement that the situation for the party is not as optimistic as it was at the beginning. Especially in the past two or three days, the government has shown signs of panic. Currently, the strength of the two factions is evenly matched, so the Seiyukai candidates are gradually being pressured. However, our party's stronghold is immovable.</p>
<p>The Entire Village Sells Votes, All Summoned</p>
<p>Tsūshin: More than 160 residents of Fukiage Village, Saitama Prefecture, secretly held a meeting and decided that the entire village would unanimously vote for the Minseito Party candidate Matsunaga Azuma. Two representatives were sent to the Matsunaga office with a voter reservation list to negotiate the sale of votes. The authorities soon discovered this, and all those with voting rights in the village were summoned for questioning. It is reported that the village intended to sell all of its votes to Matsunaga in order to obtain a considerable amount of money to be used for the village's public works. However, it is rare in recent times for an entire village to take such action unanimously.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Liberal Party First Advocated It</p>
<p>All Parties' Declarations Unanimously Echoed</p>
<p>World News Agency, Madrid: Count Romanones, leader of the Spanish Liberal Party, advocated changing the Spanish political system to a republic and electing the current King Alfonso XIII as the permanent president in order to ease the country's political turmoil. At the same time, the Spanish Radical Party, Republican Party, and Socialist Party issued a joint declaration also advocating the establishment of a republic and urging all liberal forces in the country to gather under the banner of the republic to prepare for the future implementation of universal suffrage. Many people from the professional and commercial sectors signed the declaration.</p>
<h3 id="e63">The Kings of Saudi Arabia and Iraq Hold a Meeting Under the Protection of British Warships <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Datta, 18th: King Saud of the Arab Hejaz and King Faisal of Iraq will hold an important meeting in the next few days, and the meeting place will be a British warship anchored in the Persian Gulf. The people of the two countries often have conflicts and incursions due to the border issue between Iraq and Najd, so the two monarchs want to discuss this matter together. Because there is no suitable location, they chose a British warship as the meeting place, also for the sake of preserving their faces. Henry Dobbs, the British Commissioner in Baghdad, will take a special train with Faisal from Baghdad to Basra in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Britain to Hold Another General Election <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Government's Proposal Is Subject to Many Constraints</p>
<p>The Prime Minister Will Appeal to the Voters</p>
<p>World News Agency, London: After the Naval Conference closes, Britain is likely to hold a general election. Observing the current situation, there are various driving forces that can lead to a general election, the most obvious of which are two: (1) There are many important cases related to imperial and domestic affairs that need to be submitted to Parliament, but the Cabinet's opinions on these issues are quite inconsistent. (2) The Cabinet is in the minority in Parliament and is constrained by political enemies in everything. If the Parliament is not re-elected, government affairs will inevitably come to a standstill. Currently, there are important cases pending resolution, such as the McKenna tariffs, which Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden advocates abolishing, while Lord Privy Seal Thomas strongly supports its establishment. All extreme free trade advocates support Snowden, while Labour politicians who are beneficial to protectionist trade support Thomas. Furthermore, the Cabinet is also divided into two factions on the use of huge sums of money to handle various projects to relieve unemployment. Another major dispute between the House of Commons and the government, and between the government and the House of Lords, will be the proposal to raise the school age to 15. Other cases, such as the coal mining case, the case of increasing national taxes by 20 million pounds, the report of the Palestine Mandate Committee, and the India issue, all make it difficult for the government to act under the pressure of the two major enemy parties. Therefore, it is generally expected that Prime Minister MacDonald will immediately appeal to the national voters and re-elect the parliament after the London Conference.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Warsaw, 18th: Today, the Polish Parliament suddenly staged a full-scale brawl. First, a communist member violated the rules. The Speaker ordered him to leave the chamber, but he refused to listen, so he summoned the parliamentary police to drag him away. As they passed through the chamber, a socialist member punched him in the nose. As a result, the communist and socialist members started a big fight. The whole place was in chaos and the meeting could no longer continue.</p>
<h3 id="e66">International Tariff Truce Conference <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The British Secretary of State for Trade Gave a Speech</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th: British Secretary of State for Trade Graham spoke at the International Tariff Truce Conference in Geneva, saying that countries should now conclude a truce agreement to prevent signatory countries from continuing to protect any industry for a certain number of years. This is not a free trade conference, but its purpose is to prevent unnecessary and unfair tariffs. The purpose of a tariff truce for several years is to seek possible economic security within this period and to draft treaties that reduce tariffs to the lowest possible rate based on this. Graham also suggested that the truce should start from October 1st and last for two years. The world currently feels uneasy about conducting economic procedures. If this conference fails, then countries that base their economies on free trade will also join the tariff war. Once the truce is implemented, a second conference should be convened to discuss tax reduction methods. In addition to Great Britain, 25 countries in Europe participated in this conference. The US government stated that it is not convenient to join at this time. Also, the governments of Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, and South Africa did not send representatives to attend.</p>

<p>Preparing to Replace the Security Team</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th: The armed guards protecting British merchant ships traveling to and from Chinese waters to prevent piracy are scheduled to be withdrawn from April 1st. Arrangements are currently being made because shipping companies are hiring British non-commissioned officers to form security teams. However, some people suggest that the current preparations should continue for another six months to allow the shipping bureau's newly recruited security team to have adequate training.</p>

<p>Reuters, New York, 19th: An anti-Soviet Russia anti-religious movement began here yesterday, and special prayers are scheduled to be held on March 16th. Believers of all churches are now participating in this movement.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 18th: On February 13th, British Foreign Secretary Henderson stated in the House of Commons that the British government will do its best to use its influence to support religious freedom. Russian newspapers commented that this kind of statement directly interferes in Russian issues that have no connection with British or Russian diplomacy and clearly violates the Anglo-Russian treaty initiated by the British government. All of these interferences, whether from the British government or other governments, will be regarded by the Russian people as a hostile act, and the Russian government will definitely reject them.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th: According to the Russian news agency, Russian church leader Sergius declared again to foreign journalists that the Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury are ignorant of the spirit of Christ and only want to overthrow Soviet Russia. There are no anti-religious actions in Russia. He did indeed publish an interview with Russian reporters on Sunday, saying that the abolition of Sundays and holidays and other non-working days does not hinder religion.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Central Political Conference <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Two Hundred and Seventeenth Meeting</p>
<p>The Central Political Conference held its 217th meeting this morning (the 19th) at 9:00 AM. The attending members were Gu Yingfen, Wang Chonghui, Hu Hanmin, Tan Yankai, Chen Guofu, Ye Chucang, Li Yuying, Sun Ke, and He Yingqin. The attending members were Liu Jiwen, Jiao Yitang, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Zhaoying, Liu Luyin, Chen Lifu, Zeng Yangfu, Wu Zhengting, Zhu Peide, Enkebaatu, Fang Juehui, and Wu Tiecheng. The chairman was Tan Yankai. The matters discussed were as follows: (1) Member and President of the Judicial Yuan Wang Chonghui proposed that the Northeast and Shanxi branch courts of the Supreme Court were ordered by the National Government to be abolished last year. Now that the deadline is approaching, for the sake of practical needs, it is proposed that the abolition of the two branch courts be temporarily postponed until the Court Organization Law is enacted and implemented. Five principles for the provisional handling of affairs in the branch courts of the Supreme Court are now drafted. If approved, the Judicial Yuan will order the Ministry of Judicial Administration to draft detailed clauses in accordance with the principles and submit them to the Judicial Yuan for review and implementation. The resolution was that the abolition of the Northeast Branch Court and the Shanxi Branch Court of the Supreme Court should be temporarily postponed until the Court Organization Law is promulgated. The five principles for the provisional handling of affairs in the branch courts of the Supreme Court were approved, and the Judicial Yuan was ordered to draft detailed measures. (2) The Food and Civil Committee reported on the three proposed verification and registration measures for the import, export, and transit of rice and grain and requested review and implementation. The resolution was that the three measures proposed by the Food and Civil Committee should be handled by the competent authorities of the National Government, but the verification and registration procedures should be as simple as possible. Attached are the three measures: 1. The verification and registration of rice and grain import, export, and transit in important ports should be handled by the central government, or temporarily entrusted to the provinces and cities by the central government based on the situation, but they must be subject to the guidance and supervision of the central government. 2. The verification and registration of rice and grain import, export, and transit in Shanghai should be handled by the Shanghai Agricultural Products Inspection Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines, and the ministry may invite representatives from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and other relevant institutions and groups to form a committee as an advisory body. 3. Verification and registration fees for rice and grain should be waived. (3) It was resolved to add Shao Yuanchong as a member of the Food and Civil Committee. (4) It was resolved to appoint Li Luchao as the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Mexico. (5) It was resolved to appoint Wang Zhijue as a member of the Anhui Provincial Government and Director of the Civil Affairs Department. (6) It was resolved to appoint Wang Chonghui as a member of the Guangdong River Management Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Zhejiang Province's Plan to Improve the Cotton Industry <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The cotton-producing areas of Zhejiang Province include counties such as Ningxian, Yuyao, Cixi, Pinghu, and Shangyu. The average annual output is estimated to be around 486,000 yuan. In recent years, due to frequent disasters such as wind, rain, insects, and drought, the output has decreased sharply, foreign sales have declined, and the color of the cotton has deteriorated, making the market unstable, which directly affects civil use and indirectly affects tax revenue. The Director of the Construction Department included an item on improving the cotton industry in the provincial construction administration plan. Based on the actual situation, he drafted detailed implementation steps and submitted them to the provincial government for review and implementation. The main points of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the Cotton Industry Improvement General Farm (1) Appropriately increase funding. The farm originally had regular expenses of 7,800 yuan for salaries and food, 720 yuan for office expenses, 8,700 yuan for business expenses, 360 yuan for the purchase and repair of agricultural tools, and 1,400 yuan for land rent. The original temporary expenses included 4,200 yuan for pledging land, 8,000 yuan for construction, 5,360 yuan for equipment, and 160 yuan for livestock. This year, due to the need for expansion, it is proposed to increase the funding by eighteen out of two. (2) Relocate the farm site. The farm is located in Mayan, Yuyao, about 30 miles from the county seat. Transportation relies solely on small boats, and it is located in a remote rural area. Moreover, Mayan is not the cotton production center of Yuyao. It should be relocated to Zhouxiang, as Zhouxiang is currently the most prosperous cotton production area, and transportation is available by steamship. It is easier to develop improvements and promotions here. (3) Expand the test field. The farm originally had only 200 mu of test planting land, which is only sufficient for use. If millions of cotton seeds are sown for promotion, it is still insufficient. There are 300 mu of newly reclaimed land in Zhouxiang, which should also be expanded for testing. (4) Pay attention to irrigation. Because the river water in the coastal cotton-producing areas tastes salty, irrigation is not used. Every time there is a long drought, there is nothing that can be done, which has a great impact on cotton production. The reason for the salty river water should be investigated, and the composition of the salt should be analyzed to find a way to improve it. If it is due to tidal backflow, dams should be built to prevent it. (5) Prevent hybridization. The farm plants millions of cotton plants, but only plants sorghum around the cotton fields as a barrier. The surrounding areas are all native cotton fields, so it seems that the prevention of hybridization is not adequate. Attention should be paid. (6) Set up an oil pressing factory. Cottonseed cake and cottonseed oil are widely used and are important for eliminating inferior varieties. The start-up costs for the oil pressing factory have already been accurately budgeted and should be started immediately.</p>
<p>Regarding Cotton Industry Improvement Branch Farms (A) Cixi and Pinghu branch farms have been established. The general farm is responsible for urging the implementation of all improvement matters this year in accordance with the improvement procedures. (B) What is the situation of the cotton industry in the cotton-producing counties that have not established branch farms, and is it necessary to promote it? In addition to the department's investigation and orders for handling at any time, all the regulations and budgets for the future establishment of branch farms, as well as the location of the establishments, should be discussed by the general farm and the original Cixi and Pinghu branch farms as soon as possible and reported to the department for review and approval. The funds required are also said to be raised by the department separately for expansion.</p>

<h3 id="e72">News of Taihu Bandits Fleeing into Anhui Province <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>After the joint suppression of the Taihu bandits by the land and water military police of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces began on the 17th, the lake bandits, hearing that the large armies of the two provinces were jointly suppressing them and that airplanes were dropping bombs, became very frightened and have already fled into the Guangde area of Anhui Province. Fortunately, Mr. Ye Kaixin, commander of the 52nd Division, has, in accordance with a telegram request from the Zhejiang Provincial Government, dispatched Zhang Zhong's brigade to the Guangde area to prevent and suppress them. However, it is difficult to avoid small, scattered groups from lurking in the lake, so the suppression of the bandits should continue to be carried out.</p>
<p>After this, the suppression of the Taihu bandits will still be handled by Hang Yi, the commander of the Second Regiment, on behalf of the Zhejiang Province. It is heard that, in order to unify power, the central government intends to order the land and water military police of Jiangsu Province to be commanded by Hang. (Daily News)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Zhang Qun and Yang Shuzhuang Arrive in Fujian <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the political upheaval that occurred in Fujian Province on the 6th of last month, the disputes have not yet been resolved. Recently, Provincial Chairman Yang Shuzhuang went to Beijing to report, and the central government immediately sent Zhang Qun to investigate and deal with the situation, and authorized him with a plan for handling it. Yang, accompanied by Zhang, arrived in the province on the "Pu'an" warship at 9:00 a.m. on the 14th of this month. Zhang's entourage included Guo Shihui, Chen Jianlu, and Lin Yannan. When the ship entered the port, Chen Jiliang, Commander of the First Fleet, Shen Ke, Chief of Staff of the Provisional Headquarters, Jiang Zhizhuang, Adjutant General, and Guo Yongrong, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, went to the ship to welcome them. After a short rest in Mawei, they boarded the "Weifeng" launch to the province and had lunch at the Naval Headquarters, where they met with Lin Zhong, Sa Fuchou, Yang Yugu, and others. Later, Zhang went to the Yingbingguan (Guesthouse) at the old site of the Diplomatic Affairs Office on Cangqian Mountain and convened a meeting with Chen Jiliang and the other two men to discuss the Fujian situation. He made some indications on how to resolve it, but further contacts are needed. When newspaper reporters went to interview Zhang, Lin Yannan met with them on his behalf. According to Lin, Mayor Zhang's focus on the Fujian situation is on investigation, and he will deal with everything within the scope of possibility, but the overall aim is to not harm the prestige of the central government while resolving the disputes and misunderstandings of all parties. The length of Zhang's stay in Fujian will depend on the actual situation, but he is expected to return to Beijing a few days before the Third Plenary Session. According to sources in political circles, the central government's approach to the Fujian issue is to release the provincial committee as the first step and reorganize the provincial government as the second step. Now it is proposed to proceed with both steps simultaneously, that is, to release the provincial committee on the one hand and order the reorganization of the provincial government on the other, in order to resolve the disputes as soon as possible. Regarding military affairs, Zhang Zhen's division has been re-designated by the General Headquarters as the New First Division, and Lu Xingbang's unit as the New Second Division. The Gui Zhenyuan Brigade of Liu Heding's division was transported to Xiamen on the 13th and 14th. In the future, the military defense of western and southern Fujian will likely be the responsibility of Jin Handing's division stationed in Tingzhou, Zhang Zhen's division stationed in Zhangzhou, Liu Heding's division stationed in Quanzhou, and Lin Weiguo's brigade stationed in Xinghua. This is also related to the provincial situation. (February 15)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Shandong Province River Conservancy Conference <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The provincial government, considering that the province is located in the lower reaches of the Yellow River and that river conservancy is important, has specially established the Shandong River Conservancy Committee to plan river conservancy funds, review river conservancy budgets and final accounts, plan river defense and river control methods, and supervise various projects. This morning (the 15th) at 10:00 a.m., the committee held its first plenary session at the provincial government. The attending committee members were Chen Luan Shu, Cui Shijie, He Siyuan, Li Rupu, Ge Xiangyi, Cao Xinben, Song Wentian, and Zhao Luren (Zhao is the representative of the River Affairs Bureau). The meeting was chaired by Cui Shijie, a standing committee member. The following items were discussed: (1) The Provincial Government's request to examine the River Affairs Bureau's report on the investigation of the Jizhuang breach closure project, which requires more than 710,000 yuan, requesting that the county be ordered to close the breach on its own and requesting a certain amount of subsidies (combined with item 7, Li's proposal on the two methods of blocking the river at Ji Kou and building dikes on the Xushui River, asking which one is appropriate, to be quickly surveyed and estimated by the River Affairs Bureau to determine the direction for implementation). It was resolved to submit a report to the provincial government ordering the bureau to send personnel to survey and estimate the building of dikes along the river, and to order the Disaster Relief Association to provide relief to a small number of disaster victims. (2) The Director of the River Affairs Bureau proposed that more than 40,000 yuan for the construction materials of the Hujiatan mouth in Lijin is still unpaid, requesting that the Finance Department be instructed to allocate the full amount by a certain date. Combined with the sixth proposal of Committee Member Li to urge the River Affairs Bureau to start construction of the Hukou project as soon as possible, it was resolved to approve the proposal and submit it to the government for approval. (3) Committee Member Ge suggested that, in accordance with the resolution of the provincial government meeting, urging the payment of funds as soon as possible and dispatching personnel to repair the Liu Jiazhuang Stone Dam. It was resolved to approve the proposal, which has already been finalized, and to submit it to the government to order the department to allocate funds according to the case and order the bureau to dispatch personnel to handle it quickly. (4) Committee Member Ge suggested that, in accordance with the resolution of the provincial government meeting, personnel should be sent to survey the Huangzhuang breach closure and allocate funds for repairs. It was resolved to submit a report to the government to order the bureau to send personnel to inspect and repair it. (5) Committee Member Ge suggested that the provincial government be requested to forward a request to the National Government to transfer the river conservancy works on the south bank of the Yellow River in Hebei Province and Dongming County to Shandong. It was resolved to submit a report to the government for forwarding to the central government, so that the jurisdiction could be resolved to clarify boundaries and eliminate floods. (6) Committee Member Li proposed reforming the method of purchasing and collecting grain by the River Affairs Bureau. It was resolved to withdraw the original proposal. In addition, the draft meeting rules and the draft detailed meeting rules were discussed and passed with amendments. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m. It was decided to hold the second meeting at the provincial government at 3:00 p.m. next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Appendix: Committee Member Ge Xiangyi's proposal to transfer the river conservancy works on the south bank of the Yellow River in Hebei and Dongming County to Shandong's jurisdiction is as follows:</p>
<p>(Regarding the matter of the proposal, it is found that the river conservancy works on the south bank of the Yellow River in Hebei Province adjoin Shandong to the north and Henan to the south, spanning more than one hundred and ten miles. Except for the particularly dangerous Liu Zhuang, other places are not safe. No matter where there is a loss, the damage is in Shandong. From the sixth to the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, there were five breaches on the bank. The suffering of the people in western Shandong from being flooded and the loss of property are difficult to express. The disaster victims from various places sent telegrams and reports on the project situation. The speaker has twice represented the disaster area to Pingjin, requesting the Hebei Provincial Government to allocate funds to repair the dikes and dams and to rescue dangerous projects. However, the provincial government only gave superficial treatment and did not produce the slightest effect. If this continues, our east will suffer. How long will it last? Now, it is found that the entire territory of Dongming County in the province is almost south of the Yellow River, which is adjacent to Shandong. It is estimated that the annual income of the county is more than 200,000 yuan. It is proposed that this committee submit a request to the provincial government to forward it to the National Government, and that Dongming County be made a county under Shandong, and that the jurisdiction of Changyuan and Puyang counties in the province south of the Yellow River be entirely assigned to Dongming, and that the Yellow River works on the south bank of the province be taken over by Shandong for management. Dongming's income is sufficient to repair and defend the river works on the bank with surplus, which is much more appropriate than the Hebei Provincial Government, which has long been indifferent. The views are as follows. Please submit it to the public for resolution.)</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Planning of the New Urban District in Changsha <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Changsha market has been developing rapidly in recent years, and municipal construction has also made rapid progress compared to the past. After allowing streets throughout the city, the ring road and Tianxin Pavilion Park were completed one after another. Recently, the riverside road and Zhongshan Road have been built, and land prices and rents are no less than those of Hankou. In the future, when the Yuehan Road is completed, its future development is even more unpredictable. It is necessary to decide the measurement of the new urban district and the scope of new-style buildings as soon as possible. The Changsha Municipal Construction Preparatory Office specially convened representatives from all agencies and groups in the city a month ago to discuss the boundaries of the new urban district in Changsha, and then surveyed and mapped the area in sections according to the districts. The boundary of the new urban district has now been formulated and submitted to the Construction Department, and submitted to the Provincial Government Committee for deliberation and implementation. The following is an excerpt from the Municipal Affairs Office's submission:</p>
<p>(I secretly checked that the department was ordered to survey and measure the urban roads, and all the divided areas, the designated main lines, and the width of the roads have been drawn into rough maps, with item-by-item explanations, and submitted to your department for review and approval. However, the previously submitted drawings were originally rough drafts, which are inevitably simple, and the branch lines of the city have not been drawn in detail. In the future, there may be difficulties in implementing the drawings. For the sake of prudence, the city's routes have been drawn into the urban map. There are three north-south main lines on the east bank of the Xiang River: (1) From Nanhugang along the riverbank, directly out of Xinhekou, is the third road; (2) From Jinyiling along a section of Changtan Road, connecting Tianxin Pavilion, along the ring road, reaching Jingwumen, out of Magpie Bridge, directly to the new wharf, is the second road; (3) From Yuhuating, passing through Zengjiachong Erlipai, reaching Gejialu, out of Hujidu, is the third road; There is one road on the west bank of the Xiang River: (1) From Yuwanshi along the river, passing through Guanshi Spinning Factory, out of Shijiagang, facing the riverside road on the east bank of the Xiang River. There are five east-west main lines on the east bank of the Xiang River: (1) From Nanhugang, east through Shahu Bridge Chong Huangtuling, to Weijiachong is the first road; (2) From Xihu Bridge, east along a section of the South section Road, passing through Tianxin Pavilion Mashixiang Daba Chang, to Amiling is the second road; (3) From Zhongshan Road extending eastward to Chenjialong, along the Changping Road line, to Pingjiang is the third road; (4) Extending eastward from the old city's North Great Road to Hujidu is the fourth road; (5) From the Maojiaqiao Riverbank, eastward through Kaifu Temple Panjiaping Guihuayuan Dajipo, to Zhujia Garden, is the fifth road. On the west bank of the Xiang River, there are too many mountains and the situation is dangerous, so it is not easy to develop for a while, so it is not planned for the time being. The criss-crossing lines between the other main lines are scattered like stars and are drawn in the map. The names are complicated and cannot be determined immediately, so they are not mentioned for the time being. The meeting points of the main lines have been drawn with red circles on the map, with a diameter of 500 feet. There are three places, one in Huangtuling, one in Dalong, and one in Zhangshuwuchang, which are reserved as areas for future public buildings. The south of the old city is designated as a residential area, the northeast of the old city, that is, between Hujidu and Xinmatou, is designated as an industrial area, north to Xinhe, Nanbei Miaogao Peak, west to the riverbank, east to Erlipai, and the old urban area is also included in the commercial area. The area near Yuelu Mountain on the west bank of the Xiang River is designated as a cultural area. The administrative area is located in the old 49th and 50th standard areas in the commercial area, which is more suitable. The existing administrative agencies can be relocated at any time according to financial resources. There are four parks. The one in the north is Simaochong, named the North City Park; the one in the west is the Yanjia Lake area, named the West City Park; the one in the south is Yuhuating, named the South City Park; Behind Hunan University in the cultural area, the natural scenery of Lushan is the East City Park. The high ground to the north of the industrial area and south of the Liu River is a civilian residential area. The South Diegong Mountain on the east boundary of the urban area is a public cemetery. The above plan is based on the future development trend of the urban area, and they have been separately stipulated and have been drawn into the urban public map. It is proposed that after your department submits it to the provincial affairs meeting for deliberation and promulgation, the original drawn routes will be named and printed on the map for long-term use and easy to follow.)</p>
<h3 id="e76">He Chengjun Advises Yan Xishan by Telegram <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since Yan Xishan issued a "gray telegram" advocating propriety and yielding for the sake of the country and requesting Jiang to step down, the roughly determined situation seems to be showing major fluctuations again. He Chengjun, acting director of the Provisional Headquarters and commander-in-chief of the Fifth Route Army, after receiving this news, immediately telegraphed Yan to advise him. I went to the provincial government on the 16th to meet with He and inquired about the truth of the matter. He said that Ge's telegram had no impact on the current situation and only added to the debate on the telegram. However, there were many pointless debates in the old National Assembly, and it is regrettable to see it again now. At that time, He was unable to talk for long because he was attending a meeting, so I requested to see his secretary-general, Hua Jueming, who told me about this matter and other important matters as follows: (1) Yan Xishan's "gray telegram" rashly made proposals. Chairman He has telegraphed Yan to advise him and urge him to reflect. Yan immediately replied with a telegram in very simple words, but he was not polite and his intention was active. Currently, Chairman He is drafting a telegram to persuade him again. Zhang Xueliang has already responded to the presidents of the Five Yuan with a telegram, and Chen Tiaoyuan has also contacted the Central Army stationed in Xuzhou to secure the defense of Shandong and support the central government. Currently, Chairman He plans to go to Beijing before the Third Plenary Session to meet with the Commander-in-Chief and discuss important matters in person. (2) Xia Douyin previously asked to resign as commander of the Hubei Garrison due to illness and heavy war duties. Now that the provincial pacification headquarters and the troops of the 25th Route Army stationed in Henan and Hubei have been placed under the command of the Provisional Headquarters, the existence or absence of the garrison headquarters is not important. It is now heard that Chairman He has telegraphed Jiang to ask for instructions and plans to appoint Xia as the Wuhan Garrison Commander. (3) Chairman He is planning the pacification of Hubei Province every day. He originally planned to convene a joint military and political conference to determine the methods in detail, but at the moment, the division commanders must go to Beijing to attend meetings, which is practically difficult to implement. Previously, it was reported that Hubei Province would establish four bandit suppression commanders to suppress the bandits and communists in various prefectures and counties within two months, but now that Wang Jinyu's unit has been transferred to Luohe, the pacification of northern Hubei may be undertaken by Xu Yuanquan's unit, and Wang Jinyu will be appointed as the garrison commander of the southern section of Pinghan. Therefore, the four bandit suppression commanders of Hubei Province will be determined after the arrangements have been made. As for the two units of Liu Chunrong and Wei Yisan, since Wang Jun's and Yang Shengzhi's two units have been transferred to Bengbu for defense, the defense areas they left behind will be taken over by these two units. Wei's division is now concentrating on the defense area. Xu Yuanquan will return to the defense tomorrow to inspect the bandit suppression work of his troops, and will first go to Beijing within one or two days to meet the Commander-in-Chief and report important matters in person. (4) Regarding provincial affairs, he has been actively clearing backlog cases in recent days, and it will be completed within one or two days. Chairman He crosses the river every day, and handles important matters personally. Although Huang Jianzhong, the director of the Department of Education, has resigned to the central government, He has telegraphed him to stay and asked him to take responsibility for the construction of his hometown. Therefore, before Huang returns to Hubei, the department will still be concurrently held by Director Huang to familiarize himself with the situation. The members of the provincial government will take the oath of office the day after tomorrow. Member Xie Li will arrive in Hankou tomorrow. Director Wu Xingya also replied with a telegram. Chen Tianfang has been announced as the acting chairman of Anhui Province. If he can make it in time, he can also arrive on the 18th to take office. (February 16)</p>
<h3 id="e77">The People of Sui Prefecture Resist Liu Cunhou <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: The people of Sui Prefecture, unable to withstand the oppression of Liu Cunhou, rose up in resistance, but due to a lack of unity and insufficient strength, the uprisings quickly rose and fell without much effect. Now, the people of Da, Xuan, Cheng, and Wan counties have jointly organized a militia to resist Liu Cunhou. The army was formed and sworn in on January 22, and a declaration was issued as follows: "In the past few years, the people of our Da, Xuan, Cheng, and Wan counties have suffered enough from Liu Cunhou's ravages. Da and Xuan counties have to pay millions of yuan every year. Poor people cannot afford warm clothes or enough food. Carrying burdens and grinding, every penny is a drop of blood and sweat, which must be used to pay for military expenses. If they are a little late, they will be imprisoned or beaten, suffering endless hardships. They still have to raise the full amount of military expenses. In addition, local tyrants and evil gentry exploit them from it. Liu Cunhou wants 10,000, and they have to raise 20,000 to divide the spoils. As a result, our poor people are dying and fleeing. It is really heartbreaking. The situation in Cheng and Wan counties is even worse. Liu Cunhou forced the collection of funds, which led to civil unrest. The stationed troops, Liao Liangchen and others, fabricated accusations of communist bandits and spirit bandits, burned hundreds of houses, and killed more than a thousand people. They heartlessly burned and killed, leaving no one alive. At first, the cries shook the sky, and finally, there was no place to bury the dead. The tragic scene is truly heartbreaking. If we do not punish such brutal bandits, how can we serve the country? The Joint Committee, entrusted with the public will of the four counties, has organized a militia and reported it to the National Government, accusing them of crimes and demanding their punishment. From the day the army was formed on January 22, 1930, all exorbitant taxes and levies in the four counties will be abolished, and no more donations will be collected. The local tyrants and evil gentry who have exploited the people in the past will be punished according to the law, and no more violence will be tolerated. From now on, if there are bandits like Liu Cunhou who occupy Suiding and dare to be tyrannical, our militia will still punish them in accordance with the principle of sovereignty in the people, and we will eliminate the warlords and clear the local area. Then, we will hold county people's meetings, publicly elect virtuous and capable people to handle all local education, industry, transportation, and other matters, in order to develop the spirit of democracy. This is the sincere intention of the Joint Committee to relieve the suffering of the people of the four counties and promote their welfare. This is a special declaration, and we hope that everyone will work hard." (Zhonghua News Agency)</p>

<p>Relief for fellow villagers who died in Harbin: Yao Guoqing, a resident of Xinqiao Township in this county, went to Harbin to do business several years ago because it was difficult to develop in the countryside. He gradually accumulated savings. In recent years, he has been running a money shop there, and his life is still good. Unfortunately, during the Sino-Soviet war, Harbin was at the forefront. Airplanes hovered in the air and bombs rained down. The money shop set up by Yao Guoqing was bombed and destroyed. Yao was killed by the bombing. His wife and daughter escaped from the fire pit and were left alone. Later, they were rescued by the Economic Relief Association and temporarily lived in Tianjin. However, they were unfamiliar with the place and had difficulty solving their livelihood problems. They had to find a way to return home, but they had no funds. So he wrote a letter along with the certificate of the Relief Association and mailed it to Yao Songlao of the Fude Hall here, asking for help. Yao inquired among the villagers and learned that there was no inheritance left in the countryside. However, they were stranded in a foreign land and their situation was very pitiful. He raised dozens of yuan for travel expenses and remitted it to Tianjin for the mother and daughter to return home. Their future life still needs to be figured out. It is now learned that Yao has already remitted the travel expenses to Tianjin.</p>
<p>The county government arrests rent resisters: The county government believes that the reason why the annual dues are not paid is because winter rents are not collected. However, there are bad elements who resist rent and encourage others to wait and see. Zhu Zuosheng of Wu She is one of them. The county government, after learning the facts, dispatched bailiff Cheng Wenrong to arrest him. Since the situation in Wu She was not enthusiastic, he consulted with the dues collector Wang Changqing to arrest Zhu Zuoliang. He has now been interrogated and detained. It is heard that he must be severely punished in accordance with the previous order of the Department of Agriculture to warn the others.</p>

At the same time, inspector Li Baokun and others were to select the main skeletal parts of the corpse and perform a steaming examination to thoroughly clarify the truth and resolve the case. However, due to the lack of a steamer and workers at the Niangniang Temple, arrangements were rushed. It was not until 1:06 PM that the coffin was carried from the Xiyuan Si Tu Guan outside the city into the city. Li Guangxun, Dean of Boxi Hospital, examiner Tao Pei, assistant doctor Liu Sehu, and others brought two specimen bottles.

<p>Deadline for Clearing the Assets of Yaoming Electric Plant: In October of the 17th year, the Central Construction Committee took over the Qishuyan Zhenhua Electric Plant and reorganized it. With the intention of rectifying it, they notified Yaoming of the electricity purchase contract between Wuxi Gengming Electric Company and Zhenhua, requesting them to send personnel to discuss improvements. After five meetings, no result was achieved. The Qishuyan Plant submitted a report to the Construction Committee for approval to stop supplying electricity and directly operate. They also received a part of Yaoming's poles, lines, and shed assets, intending to estimate the price for purchase. The Qishuyan Plant also sent a letter to Yaoming, requesting them to send personnel to jointly estimate the price for compensation. Over a year passed, and Yaoming had not sent anyone to negotiate. However, Yongxing Company, jointly formed by Yaoming and Zhenhua, repeatedly submitted reports to the Ministry, requesting the return of the assets of Zhenhua and Yaoming, but no results were achieved. Recently, the Construction Committee, considering that the Zhenhua assets received by the Qishuyan Plant had been organized into a debt repayment committee, which had agreed on a repayment plan, believed that the materials and assets transferred by Yaoming should also be valued for repayment to reach a conclusion. Yesterday, they specifically instructed the Qishuyan Electric Plant to notify the old board of directors of Yaoming to send personnel to the plant to jointly estimate the transferred materials and assets, fairly discount the price, and complete the process before March 10th, and submit the results for approval.</p>

<p>Collection Officer of Sutra Donation Murdered: Yu Tonghai, the collection officer of the Sutra Donation in Wu County, went to Qinglong Township outside Zhongshan Gate on the 16th to collect donations, intending to return to his hometown. While passing through Dingjiatang, someone suddenly called him to gamble at the teahouse opened by Wu Chansheng. Then, someone called him to speak outside the back door. Before he could take three steps out the door, he was shot and killed by three enemies, who then carried the body away to destroy the evidence. His wife, Tang, was shocked after learning about the incident and reported it to the police the next day to arrest the perpetrators. It was discovered that the enemy was Yang Linda. Yang's foster father, Yang Azeng, and neighbors Wang Yisheng and Wang Shengda were arrested. Yu's wife also reported the case to the County Court, which approved an order on the 18th for the police to investigate and arrest the perpetrators.</p>

<p>Users Advocate Reducing Electricity Fees: Recently, due to the high electricity fees charged by the electric light company, merchants and residents in the urban and rural areas of the county organized a users' association to discuss five points with the company: (1) The costs are too high and should be appropriately reduced compared to other places; (2) The electric lights are only on until midnight, which is inconvenient in case of defense or private matters, and should be on all night; (3) The electric meter is only accurate according to the company, and there are doubts about the speed of the meter, so a public or user company should find a suitable standard meter to avoid increased burdens on users or losses to the company; (4) The current temporary electricity fee is 50 cents per degree, which should be calculated the same as ordinary electricity in the future; (5) The company is registered with 220 pounds of power, but it is questionable whether the company currently generates 252 pounds per day. The above five points should be raised to the electric light company for discussion and improvement. Regarding this issue, the shareholders of the electric light company held an emergency meeting overnight and reportedly decided to automatically reduce the fees by 10% across the board, with some saying that the fee would be reduced to 25 cents per degree.</p>
<p>Explanation from the Department of Civil Affairs Regarding the Rickshaw Issue: The Department of Construction recently issued regulations for the management of rickshaws, and the rickshaw license fees will now be collected by the Finance Bureau. The Construction Bureau of the county wants to use these license fees for the municipal engineering office of the bureau, and has repeatedly argued for this. At the last two county administrative meetings, Director Wu of the Construction Bureau proposed urging the payment of the license fees and requested to use them, while the First District Office, in accordance with the implementation outline of the Department of Civil Affairs on local autonomy, believes that the matter should be handled by the district and requested the county government to submit a report to the Department of Civil Affairs for instructions and explanation. It is now known that the instructions from the Department of Civil Affairs have arrived at the county, and the rickshaw matter should still be handled by the District Office and the fees should be collected by the District Office.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Qu's Character Indexing Method: Original Text (Yesterday) by Qu Chongfu <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Due to the inconvenience of character indexing, Chinese scholars often do not seek to understand the meaning and origin of a character. How much has this hindered the progress of Chinese culture? Isn't this a very important question?</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yunwu stated in the 12th issue of the 22nd volume of the *Eastern Miscellany* that the methods of improving Chinese character indexing using scientific methods include those of Fan Shangren, I.M. Callery, 布列地氏 (Bùlièdìshì, likely a transliteration), P. Poletti, 華胥留氏 (Huáxūliúshì, likely a transliteration), W. Wassiliew, O. Rosenberg, Gao Mengdan, Lin Yutang, He Xisheng, and other eight methods, as well as Mr. Wang's own indexing method, totaling nine methods. I found that article in the Chinese library at Columbia University in the United States. After reading it, I spent my free time comparing the advantages and disadvantages of these nine methods, deducing their arrangement methods, and pondering their principles.</p>
<p>My new indexing method first divides the character to be found into two halves, calling them the "initial half" and the "remaining half." Then, I check the stroke numbers of the first and last strokes of the "initial half" and the stroke numbers of the first and last strokes of the "remaining half." According to this arrangement, each character will have four numbers. With more numbers, the number of available spaces will naturally increase.</p>
<p>The smallest number in my new indexing method is 0000, and the largest number is 9999. There are 10,000 (10,000) numbers from 0000 to 9999. These numbers provide 10,000 (10,000) available spaces. If the arrangement is appropriate, each space will contain only one character when arranging over 10,000 commonly used characters into these 10,000 spaces. Every time I consulted the Kangxi Dictionary while arranging the characters, I felt that my method (dividing each character into two halves) was the most appropriate, because 99 out of 100 Chinese characters have radicals and can be divided into two halves. From this, I knew that I was not on the wrong path. I even believed that if I were willing to devote myself to researching this method, my indexing method could be realized soon.</p>
<p>When I first started researching this method, I found it very difficult to assign numbers to the various strokes. Fortunately, I had learned some analytic geometry while studying at school, so I immediately applied the principles of curve comparison. After spending a lot of time, I finally determined the numbers for the strokes. Now, I will describe how each number represents a stroke:</p>
<p>My indexing method divides the various strokes into ten types of numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. When indexing, each character is assumed to have these ten types of strokes. Each type of stroke is represented by a single-digit number, so a dot is 1, a hook is 0, without any doubt. The tenth number is 0, which represents strokes with hooks and can also be used to represent missing strokes.</p>
<p>The main principle of the stroke order in my indexing method is to divide the strokes into four major categories: dots, horizontal strokes, vertical strokes, and slashes. The sequence follows the natural principle of "from simple to complex." As for my ten numbers, 1 represents dots. Dots are used as the first number because they are the starting point of all strokes. No matter what kind of stroke it is, it can start from a dot. 2, 3, and 4 are used for horizontal strokes and strokes similar to horizontal strokes. Why are three numbers needed for horizontal strokes? Because horizontal strokes are used the most. They occupy a large part in the first and last strokes of Chinese characters. 5 and 6 represent short vertical strokes and long vertical strokes. Below the dot is the horizontal stroke, and below the horizontal stroke is naturally the vertical stroke. 7 and 8 are used to represent slashes. Slashes are divided into two types: vertical slash (7) and oblique slash (8). A vertical slash is a downward stroke at a 75-degree angle, and an oblique slash is a downward stroke at a 45-degree angle. The upward stroke (7) is attached to the middle of the vertical slash because its angle is exactly the same as the vertical slash, but the writing direction is different. Vertical slashes and oblique slashes are easy to distinguish because their angles of inclination are different, and their lengths are also different. Vertical slashes are usually long, and oblique slashes are short. The downward right stroke (捺) is attached to the middle of the oblique slash because it also forms a 45-degree angle when viewed from the left. 9 and 0 are combinations of all the above strokes. 9 is used to represent curved strokes, and 0 is used to represent strokes with hooks at the end. Any stroke with a clear curve in the middle is considered 9. Regardless of whether it is curved or not, any stroke with a hook at the end is considered 0. For example, the last stroke of the character "几" is both curved and has a hook, so the number for this stroke is 0, not 9. 0 is sometimes used to represent empty strokes. For example, the character "事" cannot be easily divided into two halves. The two difficult strokes in the middle are represented by two circles. The above is the order of the ten types of strokes. These ten types of strokes are very simple and natural, so they are easy to remember. I do not use any complex strokes, because complex strokes are complex.</p>
<p>At this point, it should be explained that my definition of a "short stroke" is one that is not as long as a character, and a "long stroke" is one that is as long as a character. For example, in the character "士," the first stroke is a long stroke, and the second stroke is a short stroke. In the character "木," the horizontal stroke is long, and in the character "林," the horizontal strokes are short. The rest can be inferred by analogy.</p>
<p>A "short vertical stroke" is a vertical stroke that is not as long as a character, and a "long vertical stroke" is a vertical stroke that is as long as a character. For example, in the character "固," the vertical stroke is long, and in the character "彳," the vertical stroke is short.</p>
<p>If readers want to use my indexing method, they must first divide the character they want to find into two halves. First, check the numbers of the first and last strokes of the first half of the character, and then check the numbers of the first and last strokes of the remaining half of the character. Let's give a few more examples to illustrate this:</p>
<p>5050, number 3231, 3181 check, 1094 character, 5731 method, 1271 is, 5248 most, 1125 new, 4133 type, 5248 most, 2150 benefits, 8538 convenience, 8281 of, 3181 check, 1094 character, 5731 method,</p>
<p>According to this method, each character has a character number. Arrange each character in the dictionary according to the order of the numbers. When indexing, each character has a fixed and unchangeable position. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Classical Chinese May Be Used in Chinese Language Courses. The Ministry of Education issued a circular to the education departments of each province and the education bureaus of each special municipality, instructing them to order all publishing houses to use vernacular Chinese for editing junior high school textbooks, except for the Chinese language course, which may use both classical and vernacular Chinese. The full text is as follows: It has been found that elementary schools uniformly use vernacular Chinese for teaching and do not teach difficult classical Chinese. The former University Council has already issued a circular to implement this based on the resolutions of the National Education Conference. Furthermore, this Ministry has issued a circular prohibiting the use of classical Chinese textbooks in various cases. Since elementary schools do not use classical Chinese for teaching, students graduating from elementary schools lack the ability to understand classical Chinese texts. However, many junior high school textbooks are still edited using classical Chinese, which does not take into account the connection of levels and is very inappropriate. Therefore, in addition to issuing separate orders, the relevant publishing houses are hereby instructed to use vernacular Chinese for editing junior high school textbooks, except for the Chinese language course, which may use both classical and vernacular Chinese.

<p>The Zhejiang Education Department had previously issued guidelines for middle school students, middle school teachers, administrative affairs directors, and moral education directors. Yesterday, it issued guidelines for middle school academic affairs directors. The following is a record: (1) The academic affairs director must attend at least one class each day, record the points of observation after leaving the class, and talk with the teacher in charge of the class, propose points for improvement, and study them together. Record the points for improvement and prepare them for inspection by the provincial supervisors. (2) The academic affairs director must spend at least three hours each week with the teachers to discuss teaching improvements. (3) The academic affairs director must hold a teaching seminar for at least one subject each week. (4) The academic affairs director must pay attention to useful new books at any time, notify the librarian to purchase them, and announce the book list in conspicuous places to introduce them to teachers or students. Books that are of particular value or relevance to a certain subject should be notified to the professor of that subject in a special letter. The librarian should print and distribute the monthly list of newly added books to each teacher at the end of each month. (4) The academic affairs director must review students' works at any time, check students' extracurricular reading materials at any time, and actively connect with teaching and moral education aspects. (5) The academic affairs director must pay attention to new testing schemes, introduce them at any time, and invite colleagues from the affiliated elementary school or those who are experienced in testing and research to hold seminars. (6) The academic affairs director must assist the principal in organizing a reading club for colleagues and arranging times for mutual reports. (7) The academic affairs director, in order to supplement students' extracurricular schools, invites teachers and staff from the school, or invites scholars from outside the school, to hold various academic lectures. (8) Strictly enforce examination rules and supervise the examination during the examination. (9) Pay attention to various new teaching materials at any time, introduce them to each teacher, and pay attention to the changes in the world situation at any time. Consult with the teachers of each subject to collect and compile teaching materials that meet the needs of the times. (10) In order to actively improve the efficiency of teaching, it is necessary to improve the explanation system in class so that students are sincerely involved in the classroom. For foreign languages and other subjects, the opportunity for students to speak in class should not be less than that of teachers. As for knowledge subjects, teachers must raise one or two questions each time they attend class for students to study on their own, and as the center of the study of the next class. In short, it is necessary to confirm that "autonomy" is not limited to behavior but is an essential basic requirement for all academic work, and it is necessary to break the misconception that promoting autonomy is only for extracurricular organizations and research meetings, while teaching in class is entirely by teachers' explanations. Items one through seven above must be self-established by the academic affairs director in a weekly task table and placed on the right side of the seat to be carried out on time.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Yesterday's Women's Basketball Game: Qiang Nan and McLins Ended Unhappily <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Referee Was Unavoidably Hypercritical</p>
<p>Qiang Nan Staff Ordered Players to Leave the Court</p>
<p>Declaring Qiang Nan's Forfeit, McLins Wins</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Open Basketball Tournament, yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, Qiang Nan versus McLins took place at the China Basketball Hall. At that time, both sides' warriors were eager to fight, ready to go, but the referee Hall was awaited. After waiting for a long time, they were restless. The two team captains agreed to ask Shao Ji to take his place. As the silver whistle was about to sound, Hall arrived, so Hall changed to inspector. Suddenly, a burst of fighting cries was heard from all sides. Initially, McLins, tall and graceful, fought smoothly, taking the lead in the first quarter with a score of ten to four. From the second quarter onwards, Qiang Nan showed considerable improvement. The three forwards were incredibly agile and elusive, and the three guards inside were tightly defending, with no gaps at all. The score suddenly increased, and the momentum was great. The difference between the two sides' scores was only one point (McLins ten, Qiang Nan eight). Turning defeat into victory seemed only a matter of time. At this moment, when the military situation was turning for the better, the referee's whistle for free throws was frequently heard, causing the warriors to feel disheartened and the spectators to change color. Moreover, the referee's and the inspector's rulings were mutually contradictory. In the end, Qiang Nan still took the lead with six to five in this quarter. During the third quarter, Qiang Nan fought consistently both inside and outside, but the momentum was not smooth, and they suffered setbacks. Before long, they fell into an unfavorable position again and lost this quarter by three to seven (McLins twenty-three, Qiang Nan thirteen). Not long after the fourth quarter began, a dispute suddenly arose. The reason was that Wu Xueying of Qiang Nan had committed a foul and left the court during the third quarter, replaced by Qin Lihua. Qin was indeed strong, with agile skills and rapid movements, so it was inevitable that she was somewhat excessive. The referee repeatedly added penalty points, which seemed to be hypercritical. At this time, Qin committed five fouls in a row and retired from the court. A certain female staff member of Qiang Nan ordered the players to leave the court with a strong attitude, unwilling to continue the game, willingly forfeiting. However, the players believed in competing to the end even if they failed, rather than losing spirit out of anger (Sportsmanship). The two sides could not reach a decision. The referee immediately gave them two minutes to consider. Finally, the players obeyed their leader's orders and left the court together. The referee then blew the whistle, declaring Qiang Nan's forfeit and McLins winning by two to zero. In short, whether the referee is fulfilling their duty properly or not, there are legitimate ways to protest. Why resort to such a low tactic, which gives people the impression of pettiness and damages their reputation? The reporter felt compelled to write this after reading it, to tell the sports community today.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Deputy Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government received a telegram from Mayor Zhang saying, "Urgent, must arrive immediately." Yu's telegram to his brother Hongjun: "Today at noon, the chairman invited me to tour the Xichan Temple. Returning to the city, it was already 5 p.m. It was time for a banquet hosted by Provincial Committee Member Chen and Public Security Bureau Director Guo, so I did not return to my residence. I ordered Deputy Adjutant Li Zhongxing to take the original car back to the residence. As he was about to reach the residence, four thugs ambushed the car. As a result, the driver was slightly injured, and Deputy Adjutant Li was seriously injured. He was immediately sent to Bo'ai Hospital for treatment. One of the bandits was also injured and arrested. I was spared because I went to the banquet and did not return. I fear that rumors from afar will be inaccurate, so I am sending this telegram to inform you." Zhang Qun bows, at Hai Yin.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Further News on the Wang Leping Assassination Case <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Details Before and After the Incident</p>
<p>Wang Leping, a former member of the Central Executive Committee for two sessions, was assassinated at 11:30 p.m. the day before yesterday inside No. 314, along the road of Xiafei Lane, Mai'erxi Ai Road, in the French Concession. Three people were killed on the spot, and two were seriously injured. At the same time, a male corpse shot and killed was found under a lamppost at No. 359 on the same road. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Now, further information obtained from various sources yesterday is recorded below.</p>
<p>Full of Guests Wang was 48 years old, from Yucheng County, Shandong. He served as a member of the Central Executive Committee for the second session. His family lived at No. 3, Lane 120, Fuli Li Road, French Concession. He also opened a reception room at No. 314, along the road at the north end of Xiafei Lane, Mai'erxi Ai Road. Wang spent most of his time there every day after leaving home, except for visiting friends. The day before yesterday, not long after nightfall, more than 20 people visited Wang there. It was heard that Wang Faquan, a member of the Central Committee who had served with Wang, was also present. Everyone talked until about 11 o'clock before leaving and returning home. At that time, only Pan Xingjian, a graduate of the first class of Whampoa Military Academy (who had served as the captain of the Propaganda Brigade of the General Political Department), and Zhao Linxiang from Hebei (30 years old, also a Whampoa graduate) remained, chatting with Wang for a long time. (Note: yesterday's newspaper mistakenly wrote Pan Xingjian as Tang Dejian, and the character "xiang" was missing from Zhao Linxiang. This is specially attached to correct the error.)</p>
<p>Portrait of Wang Leping</p>
<p>Male Corpse Outside While Wang, Pan, and Zhao were talking secretly, it was midnight. Suddenly, a faint gunshot was heard from the south outside. They did not pay attention to it at the time, and the three continued to talk as before. Before long, a Western policeman on a bicycle patrolled by and saw a person lying dead under the lamppost in front of No. 359, with bloodstains clearly visible on the roadside. The Western policeman stopped to check and saw that the deceased had been shot in the left chest, and the blood was still flowing. He immediately called the doorman of Xiafei Lane to guard the scene, and the Western policeman returned to the police station to report the incident.</p>
<p>Chain of Gunshots When the Western policeman returned to the police station, the doorman of Xiafei Lane was standing by the roadside guarding the scene. Before ten minutes had passed, gunshots rang out from inside No. 314, as dense as a string of beads, lasting for several minutes before ceasing. Shortly after, the detectives sent by the police station to investigate the male corpse on the roadside arrived and immediately investigated the sound. When they arrived at the entrance of No. 314, they saw a Chinese doorman lying beside the door, groaning. They immediately went inside to investigate and saw corpses scattered upstairs and downstairs, with blood splattered everywhere. The detectives were shocked and immediately reported to the Special Agency of the General Police Station. A large number of Chinese and Western detectives rushed to the scene for a detailed investigation.</p>
<p>The Doorman Said According to Su Youxi, who lived in the same house, and the injured doorman He Peizhi (from Zhenjiangnan Township, 34 years old, who used to work in the rice industry but came to Shanghai to work as a doorman after losing his job), at around 11:30 p.m. that night, Wang, Pan, and Zhao were talking upstairs. A male servant, Kang Ruizhai, was counting money at the entrance of the staircase downstairs. First, four thugs rushed in through the front door and opened fire on He as soon as they entered, hitting his left hand. He was very alert and immediately fell to the ground, pretending to be motionless. The four thugs then reached the staircase and saw Kang and fired a shot at him, hitting his left forehead. He fell to the ground and died instantly. At this time, three more people rushed in through the back door and went upstairs together, firing a chain of shots at Wang and the other two. The thugs, seeing that their goal had been achieved, went downstairs and scattered. This was the general situation of the disaster at that time.</p>
<p>Handling of the Dead and Wounded When the detectives went upstairs to investigate, Wang and Pan had already died for some time. Zhao Linxiang was lying on the ground, crying in pain. The detectives first photographed the three corpses with magnesium powder, and then sent the dead and wounded to Renji Hospital and then to Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road for treatment, and to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for examination. They also found many bullet casings in the house, which were said to be Mauser pistol bullets. It was heard that the French consul also rushed to the scene to investigate in person to show caution.</p>
<p>Clues When the detectives inspected the scene, they found a business card with the name Ding Baoshen, 20 years old, and an envelope from Tianyi Apartment, No. 296-298, Fuxu Road, addressed to Huang Ganchen, near the male corpse on the roadside. The reporter of this newspaper immediately went to the apartment to inquire and was told that a certain Huang Ganchen from Xuzhou had indeed rented Room 5 downstairs on the 7th of this month with two other people, at a monthly rent of eleven yuan. Huang met Liang Zhiyun from Guizhou, who had lived in Room 19 upstairs since the 4th of this month, and another unnamed person. A woman visited Huang's room every day and left late at night. Huang and Liang and others went out together at 7 p.m. the night before last and have not been seen since. The apartment then sent someone to Tongren Fuyuan Hall to check and confirmed that it was Huang.</p>
<p>Suspicious Letter The reporter then found a letter from Nanchang, Jiangxi, in Room 5. The envelope was addressed to He Suzhen, upstairs at No. 72, Minhou North Lane, Hadong Road, Shanghai, and signed Yunqing from Nanchang. The full text of the letter is as follows: "Dear Sister-in-law Suzhen, I received your last two letters. I was surprised to learn that you have not yet received them. The money I remitted was transferred by Liu Lanjie. On January 1st, he wrote to say that he had received it without error and said that you had come to Shanghai and would notify you separately that the money had been received. Based on this, I believe you have received Liu's letter long ago. However, your letter did not mention Liu's matter, so I am writing to ask if Liu has written to you to prove that he has indeed received the money. Please give me a reply. If you have not received Liu's letter, please let me know so that I can question Liu separately. Now, Brother Wang and Deputy Adjutant Jiang have asked for short leave to come to Nanchang. Your box has been deposited with Brother Su. Yang Xingxiang set out on the 16th of last month and is now able to serve. I am in good health. Please don't worry. I cannot say everything in detail in this short letter. I wish you well. Your younger brother, Hu Yunqing, February 6th." According to the staff of the apartment, when Huang arrived, he had nothing but the clothes on his back.</p>
<p>Examination of the Corpses At 2:30 p.m. yesterday, the police ordered detectives to summon Wang Jing, Wang's younger brother, Zhang, Pan's wife, and Su Youxi, Kang's master, to the station. As Ding's body had no family, the Criminal Section of the police station reported to Judge Zhu Qijun of the French Concession Court, who, along with French Consul Du, visited the hall at 2 p.m. to examine each body in detail. They sat in public and first heard the detectives report the previous situation. After Judge Zhu questioned the family of the deceased, he ruled that Wang Leping had died from gunshot wounds sustained during his lifetime and approved Wang Jing's request to prepare a coffin for burial. The police station was instructed to record the location of the bullet wounds in detail and keep it on file. He also ruled that Pan Xingjian had died from a gunshot wound to the throat sustained during his lifetime and approved Pan Zhang's request to prepare a coffin for burial. He also ruled that Kang Ruizhai had died from a gunshot wound to the temple and approved his master Su Youxi's request to prepare a coffin for burial. He also ruled that Ding Baoshen had died from a gunshot wound to the chest. As there were no family members, Tongren Fuyuan Hall was instructed to prepare a coffin for burial. The families of the deceased must prepare clothing and coffins for burial today.</p>
<p>Security Meeting After the incident, the French authorities attached great importance to it. After the incident the night before last, the French Consul-General and key personnel from the police station deliberated until dawn. It was heard that afterwards, the authorities would take effective measures to ensure the security of residents in the concession in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>The Business Reorganization Committee yesterday cabled Chairman Chiang again, saying, "To Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government: Your telegram has been received with respect. We, the business community, would like to express our wishes to you again. Peaceful unification and implementation of demobilization are the established policies of the Central Government and the expectations of the people of the whole country. In recent years, industry and commerce have declined, and the people's livelihood has been exhausted to the extreme. If anyone resists demobilization and undermines unification, causing the cessation of internal strife to recur, the vitality of the business community will not be easily restored.

<h3 id="e113">Municipal Executive Committee Cables Encouragement to Mo Dehui <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee yesterday sent a telegram to Mo Dehui, the representative attending the Sino-Soviet Conference, saying, "To Mr. Mo Dehui, transferred by the Liaoning Provincial Party Department: We are pleased to learn from the reports that the Central Government has appointed you to be responsible for handling the aftermath of the Chinese Eastern Railway issue. Since the incident occurred, Red Russia has repeatedly provoked, causing frequent crises and devastation in the border areas, which is truly heartbreaking. At the Bo Li Conference the other day, Cai Yunsheng overstepped his authority, neglected his duties, made mistakes in public affairs, lost national rights, and brought shame to China and foreign countries, which was deeply hated by the people of the whole country. Now, fortunately, Wen Zheng is pointing west, handling the aftermath negotiations, and the losses in the east can easily be recovered in the twilight. We deeply hope that in your negotiations, you will learn from the past, argue reasonably, shine for the nation, and win honor for the Party and the country. Looking forward to you from afar, we are filled with anticipation. We send this special telegram to express our condolences and our sincere feelings. We hope you will understand."

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Center Construction Committee, in order to judge the various design submissions for the construction of municipal government housing, specially invited various judging consultants, such as Mr. Ye Yuhu, Capital Construction Committee Consultant Muffy, local Consultant Engineer Burns, and the committee's directors and consultants, to conduct a joint review on the morning of the 19th at 9:00 AM.

<h3 id="e122">Negotiation on Public Weight Verification of Raw Silk <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Due to the implementation of public weight testing for raw silk exports, silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have encountered many obstacles. They have publicly selected representatives to petition the Ministry. At 10:00 AM on the morning before yesterday, four representatives, Huang Jin-chen, Shen Hua-chen, Zhu Jing-an, and Cheng Bing-ru, visited the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to meet with Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (Minister Kong was ill and could not meet them). Director Zou and Chief Miao met with them. The representatives stated the various difficulties encountered in implementing the baking test for factory silk. Director Zou stated that the public weight system is the best method for fair valuation for both buyers and sellers. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce implemented this system purely to protect the interests of Chinese silk merchants, and there is no need to cancel it. Subsequently, representatives Zhu and Cheng proposed three suggestions for improvement and correction of the public quantity implementation method, requesting their acceptance: (1) For the baking test, determine that each silk has five pieces, take two pieces for testing, and take ten strands from each piece (silk is sold in units of ten strands, i.e., each silk is ten dan, with forty strands for baking). This will be the standard for the test. However, the aforementioned silk strands for the baking test should be packaged together, valued, and transported for export. (2) The implementation of public weight should be followed by both Chinese and foreign silk merchants (i.e., both buyers and sellers). The verified public weight shall be the standard for valuation. Exporters shall not arbitrarily or intentionally specify the method of valuing according to public weight or net weight at any time, so as to avoid unexpected losses for Chinese merchants. If there is a violation, the local authorities should be requested to correct it. (3) The explanation of the warehouse rent item stipulated in the implementation details is unclear. It should be acknowledged that no warehouse rent will be charged for items brought in for inspection. Director Zou and Chief Miao fully accepted the above three items and accommodated their requests. The representatives were satisfied and took their leave.</p>

<p>Director He of the Jiangsu Department of Agriculture and Mining is scheduled to convene a sericulture suppression research conference in Zhenjiang on the 19th, inviting representatives from the silk cocoon industry. The Shanghai Silk Factory Association has specially dispatched Standing Committee Member Zhu Jing-an, along with silk technician Xiong Dun-gong.

<h3 id="e124">Planning the Establishment of County Granaries Amidst Calls for Grain Storage <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The grain granary established in Shanghai County has disappeared in substance since the founding of the Republic of China. Therefore, grain storage exists in name only and not in reality. Although local gentry proposed its restoration, it was suspended due to various reasons. The county government has now received an order from the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department stating that grain storage is an essential policy for disaster preparedness and must be implemented accordingly. The establishment of grain granaries and the promulgation of organizational regulations have been sent to the county. County Magistrate Leng has sent a letter to the Finance and Property Office, urging it to quickly prepare for the establishment and organization of grain granaries in order to maintain disaster preparedness. Director Qin of the office is currently planning everything and preparing a budget. However, the division of Shanghai's grain storage between the city and the county, with a ratio of 63 to 37, was decided at a meeting last winter. The Civil Affairs Department has now submitted it to the provincial government for approval. If it is approved, the division will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3 id="e125">County Government Recruiting Land Surveying Trainees on Behalf <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Deadline for reporting to the county is the 22nd of this month. The Jiangsu Provincial Land Consolidation Committee previously recruited two classes of forty students each for the triangular surveying training institute, ordering each county to recommend students to the institute for screening. Because the new students recruited by the institute were all very young, the number of students admitted was not full. The committee has again ordered each county to recommend students to the institute, with examinations scheduled for the 25th and 26th of this month. After receiving the order, the Shanghai County Government issued a notice yesterday stating that those who wish to study may report to the county before the 22nd of this month and must pay a registration fee of one yuan in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<p>Important Discussions on the Gold Standard</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Office of the Bank of China sent a letter to its branches yesterday stating that this year's annual meeting will be held at the Shanghai General Office as usual to discuss business coordination between the general office and its branches, and to discuss the gold standard issue. The meeting is scheduled for the 23rd of this month. Please hold branch meetings before the meeting and send representatives to Shanghai to attend the annual meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Method for Allocating Funds for the City's Fire Brigade <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fire Brigade's budget was previously jointly reviewed by the Public Security and Finance Bureaus, and a method was drafted and submitted to the Mayor for approval. The submission stated, "Regarding the joint submission of a report, we received Ordinance No. 2070 from your office, stating that the budget of the Shanghai Fire Brigade has been submitted by the Public Security Bureau to the government for review. The numbers listed differ greatly from the stipulated amount of six thousand yuan. Please examine the original budget and report back after joint review with the relevant bureaus. Upon receiving this, the Finance Bureau and the Public Security Bureau immediately conducted a detailed review. The listed items in the budget are numerous, and it is insufficient to understand the true situation without on-site investigation of the income and expenditure. Therefore, we jointly dispatched personnel to conduct investigations. The results of the investigation have been reported and submitted. In order to strive for accuracy, we also jointly convened a meeting of the various fire brigades at the Finance Bureau. The actual situation of the investigation was announced to the public, and there were no dissenting voices. The Public Security Bureau considered the situation and made overall arrangements. The expenses are estimated at eight thousand five hundred forty-three yuan, one jiao, and six fen. The income, in addition to canceling all monthly donations, is actually two thousand one hundred ninety-seven yuan and two jiao for public assets. Another six thousand yuan will be issued monthly from the municipal treasury according to the budgeted amount. After offsetting income and expenditure, there is a surplus of over fifty yuan, which is intended for repairing vehicles. It seems insufficient for distribution, and it is proposed to approve an additional two hundred yuan, totaling two hundred fifty-four yuan and four fen, specifically for repairs. This will be allocated monthly by the Finance Bureau to the Public Security Bureau for verification and disbursement as needed, with actual expenditures reported and canceled. We have first prepared a statement of the recent income and expenditure of each brigade and drafted a budget table, which we respectfully submit for your review. If approved, please implement it from January of the 19th year. In the meantime, please order each brigade to prepare and submit a detailed budget, which will be compiled by the Public Security Bureau and submitted for filing. Any temporary special expenses should be submitted to the government separately for approval. This unified management method can maintain the progress of important fire prevention policies, and it can also take into account unified economics and attention to facts. Is this appropriate? We respectfully submit this joint report for your consideration and approval." After receiving the report, the Mayor ordered that it be followed.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Postal Colleagues Continue to Submit Petitions to Four Departments <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Fundamentally Cancel the Sino-American Aviation Contract</p>
<p>The Sino-American aviation contract was previously decided by the National Government based on a joint submission from the Ministries of Communications, Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Military Affairs, ordering the China Aviation Corporation to inform the United States of the fundamental cancellation. However, the U.S. government has repeatedly protested, and the American Flying Transport Company has even requested the National Government to revise the contract. It is reported that the National Government intends to submit this matter to the four departments again for review and handling. The Shanghai postal colleagues' anti-Sino-American aviation movement committee immediately telegraphed the four departments and the joint review committee, insisting on the fundamental cancellation of the contract. The original telegram is as follows: Urgent. Committee for Review of Sino-American Aviation Contract to the Ministries of Communications, Foreign Affairs, Military Affairs, and Political Finance. The Sino-American aviation contract was previously resolved by your meeting and submitted by the National Government for fundamental cancellation. The restoration of rights is admired by all. However, recent reports indicate that the U.S. company is still submitting requests to the National Government for revision, attempting to reverse the decision. If this is indeed the case, we should uphold the revolutionary spirit of non-compromise and jointly submit a petition to the National Government, sternly rejecting the U.S. request and quickly issuing an order to announce the cancellation in order to eliminate the root of the disaster and protect air rights. The Party and the nation will be fortunate. This telegram cannot express the urgency and eagerness to await orders.

<p>Expected to Arrive in Shanghai in Early March</p>
<p>The Far East Opium Investigation Team, organized by the Opium Advisory Committee of the League of Nations, has already come east. Yesterday, it was widely rumored that the team had arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. However, according to news released by the Anti-Drug Association, the team has not come to China and is currently investigating in Taiwan. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early March. The Association is actively seeking opinions from all parties, collecting evidence of the harm of foreign drugs, and properly planning countermeasures. The Association has always believed that the organization of the team is illegal and does not recognize it. Furthermore, during the Association's fifth anniversary carnival, in order to reward those who sold the most tickets, it specially prepared many airplane tickets as prizes. The ticket numbers have been published in the newspapers a few days ago. Four or five people have already come to claim the gift tickets in order to ride the plane.</p>

<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Fare Increase Resolved. The China Merchants, Taikoo, Ningshao, Sanbei, and other four companies on the Shanghai-Ningbo route caused opposition from various business circles due to the increase in freight rates, especially from the customs brokers in Shanghai. Since January, the freight of each ship has been recorded because the shipping price has not been determined. Now, during the time of congestion of export goods, various Hakka people and the four companies negotiated to resolve the dispute over the increase in fares as soon as possible. After many negotiations, both parties have made concessions as of yesterday. The shipping price of rice and grain to Ningbo has been reduced from 1 jiao 5 fen per bag to 1 jiao 3 fen. The shipping price of miscellaneous powder has also been reduced from 1 jiao 5 fen to 1 jiao 3 fen. The shipping price of oil has been reduced from 4 jiao 3 fen to 3 jiao 8 fen. The shipping price of wood has been reduced from 8 liang 5 qian per ton to 7 liang. The shipping price of foreign cloth will still be charged at 1 liang. The remaining items will be charged at 85% of the original price. Both parties have expressed their agreement. The Shanghai Hakka people have no problem with the increase in fares.</p>
<p>China Merchants Bureau Purchases Ocean Liners. After the successive accidents of the Xinhua, Xinjiang, and Xinkang and other ocean liners of the China Merchants Bureau, its ships are no longer sufficient to allocate to the various routes in the North and South Oceans. In the past month, the bureau established a ship purchase committee. At that time, the meeting was held several times, and it was planned to buy several ocean liners first to meet the demand. It is reported that the Taikoo Company's Zhenjiang, Yunnan, Shanxi, and other ships in this port are for sale. The bureau contacted Taikoo, and Taikoo asked for 185,000 taels for these three ships, while the China Merchants Bureau offered 135,000 taels. The two parties are negotiating.</p>

<p>Because the Eastern Provinces are fighting against Russia, their military equipment has been depleted significantly. They have specially purchased a batch of airplanes, artillery, pistols, mortars, and bullets from the United Kingdom and Germany to replenish their supplies. The four airplanes transported from the United Kingdom a few days ago were not allowed to land in Shanghai by the Jianghai Customs because they did not have a passport from the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs. Instead, they were transported to Liaoning via Dalian. It is said that the large amount of German guns, cannons, and bullets purchased this time is about 3,000 tons. In view of the prohibition of airplanes, when shipping to China, the carriers first telegraphed Shanghai to inquire whether they could be unloaded in Shanghai. It is now heard that the military equipment has changed its route. After the ship arrives in Hong Kong, it will go straight to Niuzhuang to land. It is also heard that another large batch of military supplies and tanks will be transported from the United Kingdom to Shanghai on March 9. It is expected that they will be allowed to land in Shanghai at that time.</p>

In the early years of the Republic of China, he worked in the law firm of Ze Min for a long time. After Ze Min went north to take a seat in Parliament, Wu was hired by Yi Peng for nearly ten years. During this time, he also served as a clerk for the Shanghai Lawyers Association for several years. Before the reorganization of the Association, the reports were all written by him. Recently, he joined the Shanghai Wu County Lawyers Association and performed his duties. His character, learning, and experience were rare among his peers. Over many years, he compiled two volumes of Explanations of the Supreme Court, which continued the tradition of official books and became a great work, benefiting the legal profession and highly regarded in the country. Unfortunately, he had a history of asthma, and also because of excessive exertion, he suffered from a deficiency of qi and blood and passed away in the spring at the young age of forty-seven. He was buried in a coffin, and his family was impoverished. His elderly mother was in great pain and wanted to die, and his wife and children were unable to survive. Their cries were the most tragic scene in life. Among his surviving children, besides the eldest who is already married, there are still two sons and two daughters whose studies and marriages will be a great difficulty in the future. We, his colleagues, feel heartache and cannot but do our best to help each other. We have chosen to hold a memorial service at the Xin Zha Pingjiang Public Office at 2 p.m. on February 22 to commemorate him. We respectfully request that all wise men in the country and colleagues in the legal profession generously donate money so that his family can rely on it and both the living and the dead will be grateful. We respectfully inform you of our humble request. Zhang Yi'ao, Chen Fumin, Lu Bohong, Zhu Shoucheng, Wang Caiyun, Fan Huichun, Zhang Yipeng, Cai Nipei, Tan Yigong, Zhang Jiazhen, Zhang Zongru, Chen Zemin, Zhao Zuwei, Liu Zuwang, Huang Huansheng, Jiang Yiping, and 30 others jointly announce."</p>
<h3 id="e161">Songhu Rehabilitation Institute Plans to Build Factory <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Songhu Rehabilitation Institute covers an area of more than one hundred acres. In addition to the construction of the institute's buildings, the eastern end has a spacious area with a mountain and a deep pool that doesn't dry up. Whoever climbs the mountain and looks out gets a refreshing feeling. Last year, after Director Wang Zhaocheng took office, he visited the institute every day to supervise. He was deeply saddened that the eastern wasteland was abandoned and uncultivated. He reported to the Social Affairs Bureau and was approved to cultivate the land and plant vegetables for food. Now, the number of unemployed vagrants in Shanghai is increasing, and it is impossible to accommodate them all. The institute is already full and cannot accommodate any more. It is now planned to add new buildings and expand the factory in the hope of accommodating more people and stabilizing society. The construction funds are planned to be raised from wealthy businessmen in Shanghai. If it is not enough, other methods will be found. The factory will advertise for investment and open various factories so that the institute's residents can learn skills and support themselves after leaving the institute. The factory site will be provided by the institute.</p>

<h3 id="e170">History of Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Published <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Tobacco and alcohol tax is a major source of income for our country. Since the establishment of the special tax in the Qing Dynasty, it has been a long time, and there have been many changes and benefits during this period. However, there are no specialized writings on this subject in both public and private sectors, which is regrettable for those concerned about tax administration. Last year, the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance specially established a Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Affairs Committee to start editing the History of Tobacco and Alcohol Tax. The content is divided into ten chapters: evolution, region, tax system, public sales fees, tobacco and alcohol tax, license tax, cigarette tax, foreign liquor tax, overview of revenue and expenditure, and overview of sorting out. Relevant public and private writings on tobacco and alcohol tax are attached at the end for reference. The authors of this book are all well-known figures with knowledge and experience. The descriptions of tax rule changes and the current system are very detailed. It is a great work in the financial world. The upper volume has been published and is sold by the Dadong Bookstore in this city. The lower volume is being proofread and will be published soon.</p>

<p>A Chinese merchant from the United States, Mr. Li Junyao, purchased ten Zhong Ling air pressure machines from the Hanli Company and shipped them to the United States. The overseas Chinese merchants believe that the machine is easy to print and can be called the world's supreme victory, which is enough to resist mimeograph machines. They were sold out quickly, and each machine was sold for 60 US dollars. Although the US import tax is expensive, there is still a large profit to be made. It is now heard that Mr. Li has telegraphed the Baoling Company in Hong Kong to contact the Shanghai Hanli Company to negotiate the general agency in the United States and to guarantee the sale of 160,000 yuan per year. Both parties have agreed on a contract. Our country's new manufactured products are sold in the most developed countries in manufacturing, and this should be the first.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Correspondence <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>To whom it may concern, our hospital has always followed the Health Bureau's guidelines for smallpox vaccinations. We have checked and found that from January to February 19th of the nineteenth year, no smallpox patients came to our hospital for treatment. The information published in your newspaper yesterday was likely based on inaccurate rumors. We are writing this letter to clarify the matter and request that it be published in the "Letters to the Editor" section to ensure accuracy. Sincerely, Wang Zhen, Shanghai Pudong Hospital, to the Editorial Department of Shen Bao.</p>
<p>Esteemed Editor, I am writing to you regarding the news item under the headline "Husband and Wife Incompatible" in today's local news section of your newspaper, which concerns me and has caused me great alarm upon reading it. The truth is, I married a woman named Chen, but due to her inability to please my elders, domestic disputes arose from time to time. In order to seek peace, I personally sent her to live with her mother in the autumn of the seventeenth year and provided her with monthly alimony. For over ten months, this arrangement caused no issues. However, near the end of the lunar year of last year, I received a summons from the First Precinct of the First District, ordering me to go to the station. I then learned that she had come to Shanghai and, at the instigation of others, intended to make trouble for me. I explained the circumstances of my family to the precinct chief, who, after understanding the situation, instructed both parties to reconcile outside the station. However, reconciliation could not be achieved because her demands were excessive and I was unable to meet them. On my part, I have always hoped that she would reform and reconcile, and I have adopted a policy of waiting and seeing how things develop. I believe that she would not dare to take any extreme actions. The report in yesterday's newspaper about a mutual scuffle is entirely fabricated. I respectfully request that your esteemed editor provide a correction to avoid misleading the public. I would be most grateful. Respectfully submitted, Mi Chuxin, No. 3 Hexing Lane, Wangjia Wharf, South City, February 19, 19--.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Farewell to the Gentlemen of the National Walking Tour <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>In my youth, I read English books such as *Robinson Crusoe* and Mr. Liang Rengong's *Fifteen Young Heroes,* which often sparked my imagination.</p>
<p>I wanted to emulate Robinson Crusoe and drift to a deserted island, and I also wanted to follow the fifteen young heroes and explore the wilderness. At that time, my ambition soared to the sky and I was truly invincible. But as time went by, my age increased year by year, and my family burdens became heavier and heavier. My ambition also decreased year by year. Living in this beautiful and prosperous Shanghai for a long time, I have been completely corrupted. I have neither finished reading ten thousand books nor do I want to walk ten thousand miles. Recently, I heard that Mr. Xie Fensheng, Ge Wenlie, Liu Hanqiao, Lou Xia, Zhuang Xueben, Xu Yintang, Xu Zengxiang, Liang Daxin, Jiang Xixi, and others have organized a national walking tour that will traverse the entire country in five years, without turning back despite all difficulties. Such a great undertaking is truly unprecedented. I cannot help but feel my heart flutter and regret that I cannot get rid of everything and go with them. The night before last, at the farewell banquet, I personally heard the great theories of these gentlemen and learned that their organization is very complete and their ambitions are very great. This trip will investigate the history, geography, local customs, languages, literature, economy, industry, education, transportation, and other conditions of various places, and collect evidence to provide society with academic and construction references. They are prepared to fight against any difficulties and dangers with the blood and sweat of nine people, hoping to achieve the final victory and return fully loaded. This fearless spirit of the new China and the new youth is worthy of our advocacy and worship. Today is the day of departure for these gentlemen. I dare to offer a heartfelt blessing for their health and success.</p>
<h3 id="e179">News about the 300th Anniversary of Wu Meicun <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Shuo</p>
<p>Recently, our country's scholars have focused their minds on science, which has inevitably led to the gradual decline of traditional Chinese studies. However, many countries in Europe and the West have turned to embracing our country's traditional Chinese scholars, especially France. It is said that many of the four major books in our country have been translated. Recently, I heard from a certain doctor who returned from Paris that the French especially admire Mr. Wu Meicun of Taicang among our country's literary figures. They have already made a very solemn expression, saying that one day they will form a group and come to China to visit Mr. Ke Li and hold a 300th anniversary memorial meeting. Their worship has reached its peak. If it becomes a reality, it will be an unprecedented grand event. Now, according to the genealogy of Mr. Wu Meicun written by Gu Shishi of Taicang, he was born on May 20th of the 37th year of the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty and died on December 24th of the 10th year of the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty. From the 11th year of the Kangxi period to the 19th year of the Republic of China, it has been 259 years. The date of the 300th anniversary memorial is still 41 years away. When the meeting is held, I am afraid that those who initiated this proposal may not all be able to witness its grandeur in person. It is impossible not to hope that those who come later will inherit the previous aspirations. Wu Yuyang's poem says, "White hair filling in the words of the wine sacrifice of Wu." Yuan Zicai's poem says, "Born in the turbulent years of Tianbao, marvelously chanting the long celebration chapter of Xiangshan. Even if the hearts of the Wu people are wooden and stone, they should also read it and be moved." Its value can be known. Mr. name is Weiye, Zi Jungong, and Meicun is his other name. He became the champion in the provincial examination at the age of twenty-three. In the imperial examination, he was ranked second in the first class, the second scholar, and entered the Hanlin Academy. The edict said, "Lu Ji's poems and essays were unique in Jiangdong in his early years. Su Shi's articles spread throughout the capital in one day." At that time, it was considered not to be unworthy. As for his entry into the Qing Dynasty, he served as the libationer, recommended by the two prime ministers of Liyang Hai Ning and the governor Ma Guozhu. However, the officials at that time were urgent and forced him to take office. The two parents shed tears, and they feared that resisting the imperial decree would lead to unforeseen consequences. Mr. wrote a poem to Governor Ma, saying, "Ashamed to be recommended as a virtuous minister by Xiao Xiangguo, Zhao Ping is only fit to guard the melon hill." He also sighed and said, "Wasted a lifetime in officialdom. It is easy to abandon the family but difficult to change the name." However, his deathbed words were, "It is not easy to abandon wife and children, but what is the use of saying that it is not worth a penny." Mr. left because he could not bear to burden his parents, but he said that he missed his wife and children, and his intentions can be said to be extremely bitter. Now, foreigners still admire him. Not only is his writing more prominent, but his heart is also greatly understood.</p>
<h3 id="e180">A Description of the Newly Invented Artificial Rain Ball <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Jin</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Xu, has studied in France for many years and specialized in mechanics. According to a recent newsletter, the French are naturally fond of danger. They spare no effort in their intelligence to engage in earth-shattering undertakings. The Mont Cenis Tunnel, the Suez Canal, and the Panama Canal are especially large examples. Recently, in view of the Sahara Desert in non-French Africa, which spans more than three thousand miles, where the soil is dry and it does not rain all year round, which is a major obstacle to colonization, after repeated research by scholars, Professor Lorte of the Science Department of Gesnai Duang University invented the latest artificial rain ball. The method is to first put a kind of coldest gas into a rubber ball, and tie it with a button at the lower end. Then use electricity to transport it and let it rise into the air. After a long time, the ball gradually breaks due to the rotation of the button. The gas then comes out through the cracks and spreads throughout the air like clouds. It suddenly reduces the heat generated by the sun in the upper layer. At this time, the sparse heat in the air mixes with the heavy cold air in the ball, forming extremely fine water droplets that fall gently. Although the momentum is not great, it is enough to nourish the millet seedlings and moisten the soil.</p>
<p>Last winter, Lorte personally went to the Sahara to test the ball. He opened the ball from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM. It looked like a hazy mist, but the two spots did not fall. He then added enough power and radiated it directly into the air. It was not until after 1:00 PM that dark clouds gathered and the sky was dark. It rained heavily, and everything within a mile was soaked. This was the first test. Later, he conducted second and third tests in Vistre, a nearby place, and the efficiency was more obvious. The raindrops were fine, dense, and even, and could spread to four or five miles away. Lorte was very happy, believing that within ten years, this vast and boundless wasteland could be transformed into a fertile area for utilization and enrichment. It can be determined that more forests must be planted, then the weather and geology will change. The Egyptian desert, which used to rain once a year, now rains once a season. In the future, it may rain once a month. With the evolution of the world's material civilization, how can we see that the power of science is not enough to seize the work of creation?</p>
<h3 id="e181">On Hobbies <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Chun Hua</p>
<p>Almost everyone has special hobbies. Using a person's hobbies to determine their personality is the most accurate test. I am a mediocre person. My life has been uneventful. But my hobbies are worth mentioning. In terms of food, I like salty and sour flavors and hate sweet flavors. When I read books, I liked to read clever and witty essays and hated lofty and classic books. In recent years, I have been very fond of watching movies. Among Western stars, I like Janet Gaynor the most. The famous films she starred in, such as *Seventh Heaven*, *Sunrise*, *Street Angel*, and *Four Devils*, have deeply moved me. Her technique is not the highest, but I don't know why, the power of her inspiration to me is extremely great. As for stage plays, I was very fond of Cheng Yanqiu in Beijing for several years. In recent years, I have been working at night in Shanghai, and I have very few opportunities to watch plays. When Cheng comes, I can only watch him once on Sunday. Among the records, I like listening to Xun Huisheng's records the most. Huisheng's singing deeply grasps the essence of writing, lingering and exquisite. The records recorded by other actors have many tasteless tastes. Furthermore, when it comes to reading newspapers, I always ignore military and national affairs and browse social news. I can read almost every word without missing one. There are many strange things in Shanghai society. The newspaper only selects a small part of them. I feel that I have had enough of it. Also, in the past, I was addicted to playing mahjong. I did not listen to any warnings. I even wrote to praise the game, believing that the construction and configuration of mahjong have mathematical interest and are in line with aesthetics and mechanics. The choice of taking or discarding cards is also full of psychological research. It is also meticulous and without flaws. It can be called the saint of gambling in the world. In recent years, I have seen a little more of the world, and my love for it has faded. But I have become even more fond of Go. I believe that I am the most uncontrollable and mediocre person.</p>
<h3 id="e182">A Brief Account of the Archery Competition <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>

<h3 id="e183">The Romantic Fortune of a Defrocked Monk <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Yu'an</p>
<p>There is a tobacco and paper shop on Datong Road, established by a defrocked monk. It has now changed hands. The monk's surname is Luo, and he is from Yancheng.</p>
<p>While still a monk, he was the abbot of a certain temple. The temple was quite wealthy. Within a few years, Luo accumulated assets of four or five thousand yuan. His six senses were not yet cleansed, and he had an affair with a woman in the vicinity. They were secretly carrying on, not just occasionally. The woman had a husband, who eventually found out about the affair. He was furious. Instead of blaming his wife, he planned to hire thugs to beat up Luo. The woman secretly told Luo about the plan. Luo was afraid. Relying on his savings, he resolutely removed his cassock and urged the woman to elope with him. They then came to Shanghai together. After living there for half a year, he opened this tobacco and paper shop. The woman's husband also managed to find out their whereabouts. He wanted to take revenge. Coincidentally, Yancheng was experiencing a famine, and life was difficult. So, he brought his mother and younger sister to Shanghai. He planned to find work, and have his mother and sister work as servants. He also intended to reclaim his wife.</p>
<p>The day after arriving in Shanghai, he and his sister went to spy on Luo. As expected, they saw Luo, but he had changed into secular clothes. They did not see the woman. Not daring to act, Luo was at the counter doing business. Suddenly, he noticed two people lingering. Upon closer inspection, he recognized his enemy. He was greatly alarmed and went inside to tell the woman. The woman immediately escaped through the back door and hid in the neighbor's house. Her husband and sister watched for three days, but never saw the woman. They were at a loss. They instructed the sister to come and check from time to time, while the husband went to find work. After more than ten days, the woman's guard was slightly lowered. She happened to be standing in front of the door when the sister saw her. Delighted, she approached the woman. The woman was flustered. Seeing that only the sister was present, and not her husband, she was not afraid. She quickly invited the sister into the room and they talked about what had happened since they had last met. The woman boasted about Luo's wealth. The sister was quite envious. She was already over twenty and still had no husband. Before the woman had eloped, the sisters-in-law had gotten along well. Moreover, the woman had never given birth. Luo, now a layman, was very concerned about having descendants. The woman worried that she might be abandoned in the future. Luo might marry someone else, and she would inevitably be discarded. She also thought that her sister was meek and would not threaten her position. So, she used her eloquent tongue to persuade her to follow Luo. The sister agreed. Thus, Luo killed two birds with one stone, and was completely satisfied. He then sold his shop and still had several thousand gold coins. He took the woman and her sister and left to avoid trouble for a while. Although they were still in Shanghai, the woman's husband could no longer find them. He could not reclaim his wife, and he had lost his sister. He was extremely frustrated. When his mother arrived, she broke down and cried in front of the shop. People in the area then learned the whole story. Many condemned Luo and felt sorry for the woman's husband.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Warmth in the Heart (132) <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Notables Uproariously Play Hide-and-Seek, a Charming Woman Willfully Gives Protection</p>
<p>Let's talk about the spring farewell party on March 30th. It was Zuo Shichen's turn to be on duty. That evening, he hosted a banquet at the Mingjing Club. At this time, the weather was gradually getting warmer. Shanghai's commercial affairs are densely populated, and the houses are lined up one after another. It is often difficult to find an open space. However, this racetrack is in the center of the concession, the most prosperous and lively place, but this open and sparse grassland is left behind. It is truly rare and valuable. That night, because the weather was warm, the windows facing the racetrack were opened, and the gentle breeze flowed in, blowing on the face without feeling cold. The girls were all wearing light cotton clothes. At this time, camel wool had not yet prevailed in China. When the spring cold was still tight, everyone wore silver fox and pearl skin clothes. Removing the small fur clothes, they wore cotton clothes. Those who were particular used fine needles and dense threads to sew them, calling them ten-thread cotton jackets. A group of tailors came up with new patterns, using silk threads to sew various patterns, such as plum blossoms on broken branches, or large orchid flowers, or flowers, bamboo, mountains and rocks, or feathered figures. In short, you like that look, you can sew that look. What you can say can be done. Today's Su Jun wore a West Lake-colored ten-thread cotton jacket made of Huzhou crepe, with apricot blossoms and swallows sewn on it. The Yiqing Xianguan wore an襖zi made of water-gray patterned black velvet. That kind of velvet, although said to be produced in Zhangzhou, Fujian, has recently been woven by weavers in the Nanjing area. Wearing it is enough to make people look at her. The other girls were also competing for beauty. Only Hua Ruiyun wore a cotton jacket made of shimmering flower satin inside. It is said that the clothes were not her own, but her older sister Hua Ruiyun's first. She inherited her older sister's name, but she was Hua Ruiyun the second. Her older sister was the first adopted daughter of the old madam and was also a famous prostitute. She was married off the year before, and the old madam made a lot of money. So, now she is teaching her to inherit this brand, hoping that her business and her fame will not be less than her older sister. Secondly, with this winning brand, it cannot but continue to be used. The brands of the leading girls in the hall, like the famous trademarks in the business world, are equally valuable. After the old madam married off Hua Ruiyun the first, there were still many clothes hidden in the boxes. Now, take them out and see that there are many clothes that have only been worn two or three times and folded in the boxes. It is really a pity to tear them down and remake them. However, no matter what era, women's decorations and clothes change the fastest. Because silk and satin shops and garment makers are thinking about turning over new patterns all day long. If a style is set down and never changes, and you have to wear it until the clothes are broken, then they will only have to drink the northwest wind to live.</p>
<h3 id="e185">The New Four Beauties <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Zhu</p>
<p>In the past, during the warlord era, those who held high positions and enjoyed high salaries mostly had tombstones without inscriptions. It was already rare and precious to have one or two like the Master of Wanxiang Studio, the Upright Scholar of Penglai, who dabbled in literature. Among the important figures of the Party and State in recent times, there are many who are proficient in the arts, too many to count. The difference between the virtuous and the unworthy can be seen here. Recently, I saw four screen panels at a friend's place, written by Tan (Yankai), Yu (Youren), Hu (Hanmin), and Wu (Zhihui). The calligraphy was vigorous in regular, cursive, and official scripts, fully embodying the four styles. My friend regarded them as treasures. I saw them and said with joy, "These are truly the so-called 'Four Beauties Complete.'"</p>

<h3 id="e188">Gold Market Changes Three Times in One Day <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Unpredictable, Revealing Signs of Upsurge. Yesterday, the gold market on the 19th was unpredictable, with twists and turns. In the morning, it was weak, but in the afternoon, it was strong, with highs and lows of 4.67 taels. Later, the market turned strong to a setback, also with fluctuations around 3 taels. The psychology of the industry was still stable and firm, thus revealing a potential upsurge. There were many buyers in the market. If Yuan Cheng Yong, Yu Da, Zhi Feng Yong, and Da De Cheng, etc. all bought in, then the sellers included Wan Xing, Shun Li, and Tai Xing, etc. However, in the afternoon, Yuan Cheng Yong, Yuan Yong, Wan Xing, and Cheng Feng Yong sold out, while Yuan Heng and retail households, etc. bought in. As for the trend of foreign exchange, which tended to be outstanding, industry insiders and speculators had already started to cover their positions. Early in the morning, the long strips saw growth, first falling by more than one tael, and suddenly buyers flocked in, and the price stepped up frequently. In the afternoon, it even broke through 490 taels or more. However, it was Wednesday, and there was no market for drafts. Later, due to the activities of sellers, it returned to between 88 taels. However, compared with the previous day, it still rose by more than one tael.</p>
<p>After Weakness, It Rose, Once Exceeding 90 Taels at Closing. British silver bars have recently increased by 0.0625 for the near term and 0.125 for the far term. The price of silver has also increased by 0.125. The exchange rate has not changed, resulting in the April gold standard opening low, at 485 taels and 4 qian, a small drop of 1.7 qian. The gross margin immediately returned high by 3 taels. There were quite a few buyers, and the draft was also strong. The recent British gold was traded at 11 pence and 875. The US gold was also sold by the East Asia at 48 yuan and 375. At the time of the first announcement, it was 88 taels and 2.3 qian. The listed price did not change. Subsequently, because the March British gold could be settled at 11 pence and 8125, and the May gold at 11 pence and 11875, it fell to 86 taels and 8 qian. After 10 o'clock, the Guangbang and Fuchang, etc. all chased in, and the draft also saw stability. Banks mutually made Citibank 48 yuan and 375, so the price rose by 2 taels and 0. At about 11 o'clock, it was 89 taels and 1.2 qian. At that time, Huabi, etc. sold April British gold at 11 pence and 875, and the hedgers slightly sold off the strips. At 11:30, it fell to 87 taels and 7.8 qian. Later, the draft recovered and strengthened. Citibank sold the next month's gold at 48 yuan and 25 through East Asia. The June British gold bank made a deal at 11 pence and 875. The April and May must be settled at 11 pence and 8125 to 75. The price of gold jumped by more than 2 taels. At noon, it reached 90 taels and 0.1 qian. There seemed to be more buyers on the table. If Da De Cheng, etc. all took action, then the closing price was 89 taels and 6 taels, and it was higher than 90 taels again.</p>
<p>Turning Strong to Weak, Closing Price Still High by 1.3 Taels. The after-market opened at 90 taels and 0.7 qian, but the afternoon closing had already exceeded 90 taels. Continuing to 91 taels, people's hearts were very high. However, it was heard that overseas Indian exchange was large, so it unloaded more than one tael, and Cheng Feng Yong, etc. sold out, so at 2:30 it fell to 89 taels and a half. After that, it suddenly broke through the 90 taels mark. At 2:25, it was 90 taels and 0.4 qian. However, it was Wednesday, and foreign exchange was suspended as usual. A certain Chinese merchant speculator had quite a bit to resist. However, the gold industry also slightly covered the position. It is estimated that 70,000 to 80,000 pounds were bought in.

<p>The cotton market remains sluggish and trapped in a state of depression, mainly due to frequent adverse news. Although the American cotton market remained flat yesterday, the Indian cotton market experienced a sharp decline. Demand for local cotton is weak, while a large volume of Indian cotton has been traded. Although current various factors have not caused much impact, the future pressure may be difficult to avoid. It is reported that the recent sharp drop in American cotton prices has attracted the attention of cotton farmers, greatly reducing their interest in planting cotton, and there is a risk of a reduction in the new cotton planting area. If so, the American cotton market may gradually stabilize and provide impetus to the cotton market. However, the reduction in work by Indian yarn mills is also a hidden concern for the cotton market.</p>
<p>The futures cotton market continued to be sluggish. In the morning, the Exchange's Han Standard cotton was weaker due to the sharp drop in Indian cotton, with declines ranging from five fen to one qian for all months. The market remained weak in the afternoon, continuing to fall by five fen to one qian. However, the situation for the current month is quite varied. Statistics show that the total trading volume for the day was 21,400 dan. The closing prices of Han Standard cotton are recorded below: Han Standard Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Account Balance; Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Account Balance: 2 -- 35.05, down... 38,400; 5 -- 34.45, down 0... 67,700; 3 -- 34.60, 5... 65,000; 6 -- 34.55, down 15... 50,700; 4 -- 34.45, 5... 70,500; 7 -- 34.60, down 10... 29,700.</p>
<p>The sales of Indian cotton are strong again, while spot cotton transactions in the market remain weak. Indian cotton sales are strong again due to its low price. 200 bales arrived at the wharf. Transactions were as follows: Xing Heng Hua 35.00; Li Tai Factory purchased 300 pieces, to be shipped immediately, also 35.50; Yong An Factory purchased 3,000 pieces, 345 to be shipped; Oomra 34.50; Shen Xin Factory purchased 1,000 pieces, spot delivery to the factory; Wusong Hua 35.5 to 35.25, Pu Yi Factory purchased 400 bales, spot delivery to the factory; Da Cang Hua 36.25; Su Lun Factory purchased 200 bales, also delivered to the Su Factory.</p>

<p>American cotton shorts slightly covered positions. Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to poor news from Liverpool and selling from the South, but later rebounded due to some shorts covering their positions. Futures prices rose or fell by one to two points. Spot prices remained unchanged. English cotton futures fell by fourteen to fifteen points, while spot prices fell by eighteen points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by ten points. Indian cotton weakened sharply due to the decline in American cotton prices and profit-taking by long positions. Ping Gu Er prices for near and far months fell by eight rupees. Oomra and Bai Luo Xi prices for near and far months fell by nine rupees. The original telegraph record is on the left.

<h3 id="e196">Grain and Flour Market in Extreme Chaos <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market presented another chaotic situation. The ups and downs throughout the day were entirely driven by market sentiment. During the initial trading session in the morning, the current month once returned to 2 taels, 5 qian, 8 fen, and 7.5 li, which was one fen better than the closing price of the previous day. However, for the March contract, some factories continued to offer their positions, and short selling reappeared, resulting in strong selling pressure and an unstable market. During the second trading session, due to enthusiastic selling and the emergence of short positions, the current month's price fluctuated violently, with the closing price dropping to a low of 2 taels, 5 qian, 6 fen, and 2.5 li, which was a significant drop of 2.5 fen from the opening high. The other months were relatively calmer, falling by half a fen or seven li compared to the previous day. However, the situation changed again during the afternoon trading session. The months that had declined simultaneously in the morning now simultaneously turned upward because the quoted price of foreign wheat had slightly improved by two jiao or three to four jiao. Northern merchants were interested in the current month, so the opening was flat, but then it rose. The other months became stable because of this reason. Observing the subsequent situation, various factories have indeed ordered foreign wheat, so sharp increases should not be seen again in the future. As a result, the current month improved by 2.5 li compared to the previous day, March improved by 5 li, April remained unchanged, May improved by 7.5 li, June remained unchanged, and July decreased by 5 li.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the futures wheat market, the market situation for all months during the morning and afternoon sessions had become more moderate. Some outside speculators had already purchased a considerable amount a few days ago, but due to unfavorable opportunities and a sharp drop in the spot market, they inevitably had doubts. The buying interest in all months yesterday had come to a standstill, and the market value showed signs of softening. Observing the future trend, if there are further changes in foreign wheat prices, the market may still be unstable. As a result, the current month was down by 2 fen compared to the previous day, March and April were each down by 1 fen, and June and July new wheat were also each down by 1 fen. Spot wheat had no trading because factories mutually avoided it and had no intention of taking over.</p>
<h3 id="e198">River Down Rice Market Soars <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the market was tight. Ships arriving with goods were becoming scarce because the prices in the producing areas have been rising frequently recently, making it unprofitable to transport rice to Shanghai. Therefore, local merchants are holding firm and trying to raise prices. Northern merchants are asking for about two jiao more for high-quality white japonica rice, but buyers' appetite has diminished and there is no longer the brisk trading of the previous day. Top-quality japonica rice is priced at 19 yuan and 2 jiao, so most stores are focusing on medium and lower-grade goods. Therefore, the mid-level market continued to improve by two to three jiao, but trading decreased. The supply of Bo Dao rice is slightly tight. Although arrivals are small, sales are also sluggish. The overall market fluctuates by only one jiao. Yang Du Xian rice and foreign Xian rice trading is quiet. However, due to the scarcity of goods, prices continued to rise by one jiao and a half. The need for silver dollars is earnest, so a turnaround may not be surprising.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Arrivals from the River Down area are steady. Sales in this area vary. Changshu and Wuxi northern japonica rice sales are relatively flat. Prices are rising due to the continued rise in prices in the northern market, and are closely following with nearly one jiao. The buying interest in Jiangsu and Tong japonica rice is quite brisk. However, buyers are unwilling to release their holdings, so prices are only increasing slightly. The inventory of southern Bo Dao rice is thick, and arrivals are also strongly avoided. Sales are sluggish and prices are trending down. The supply of Yang Du Xian rice is slightly reduced, and demand remains good. The overall market is neither prosperous nor declining. White Yuan rice sales are slow, and prices have slightly decreased. The current price for Top Yuan rice is about 16 yuan and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Small Broken Rice Sales Slow, Prices Fall <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Saigon Goods Short, Continues to be Popular, Five to Six Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market slightly changed. Arrivals of small broken rice were high, sales were slow, and prices fell by one jiao. The Saigon rice market lacks goods on the market, and futures were also slightly up by five to six fen. The rest were flat and stable. Spot market inventory consists only of large and small broken rice. Small broken rice had high supply and sluggish sales. 3,000 bags were offered yesterday, priced at 13 yuan and 6 jiao to 13 yuan and 3 jiao and 2 fen, which was one jiao lower. 2,000 bags of large broken rice were offered, priced at 13 yuan and 2 jiao and a half to 13 yuan and 5 fen. Futures offerings included 3,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon March rice, priced at 6 taels and a half. 100 tons of May rice, priced at 6 taels, 3 qian, and 2 fen. 1,000 bags of small broken rice, priced at 6 taels and 1 qian and a half. 4,000 tons of March and April rice, priced at 5 taels, 9 qian, 6 and 7 fen. 13,000 bags of Min Dang March rice, priced at 6 taels, 3 qian, and 6 fen to 6 taels, 3 qian, and 3 fen. The small broken rice and other items were dumped by Nissin and Fook Ka foreign firms. The rest were covered.</p>

<p>Yesterday, according to sugar market reports from producing areas, the current price of Cuban sugar remains at 2.0625. New York sugar futures for March are at 1.68, and May is at 1.78, each up by two points from the previous report. September is at 1.96, and December is at 2.05, also up by one point each. Both current Javanese sugar and March futures are priced at 10.625, rebounding by 25. The April price is at 10.75, with no increase or decrease. After the Public Association market plate for No. 24 Dutch raw and white sugar gradually declined, some traders proposed reorganizing to maintain long positions. As a result, market sentiment improved, and the transaction price reached 7 taels and 5 fen. Furthermore, sellers became scarce, and the market showed strength, suddenly increasing by 5 fen compared to the previous day's market. Finely ground white sugar was at 7 taels, 1 qian, and 2.5 fen. No. 10 medium white sugar was at 6 taels and 8 qian. Although the number of transactions was not high, the market showed stability. The Japanese sugar market also asked for higher prices: N Mark was at 7 taels and 5 qian, YP Mark was at 7 taels and 6 qian and a half, YT Mark was at 7 taels and 4 qian, and ER Mark was at 7 taels, 7 qian, and 2.5 fen.

<p>Recently, ice storage has run short, and prices are quite tight. Gao Zhuang ice Tai Yuan brand is not available on the market. The Five Blessings ice market has recovered by one qian and has also opened for business. The newly arrived Peacock brand goods are also good, priced at 6 taels and 6 qian. Only over 200 boxes of unified hand-ice were imported by the Tai Yuan wheel on the previous day. With little inventory, dealers plan to raise prices again, but have not yet opened. The price of Five Blessings ice in future shipments is expected to be 6 taels and 7 qian. If the number of arrivals is limited, it will not be difficult to form a plate.</p>

<p>The trade of British tinplate in this port has been very active recently. Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao merchants all have very strong demand, and factories in this area are also doing very well. Therefore, supply cannot meet demand, and prices are surprisingly strong, estimated at 10 taels and 5 qian per box (90 pounds) and 11 taels and 3 qian (100 pounds). Yesterday, the market offered a total of 800 to 900 boxes.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from London yesterday, each box is priced at 19 shillings and 2 pence (90 pounds) and 21 shillings and 2 pence. Each is 5 pence better than before, and there is not much spot available. Merchants from various ports are buying a lot, so the market trend is becoming unusually firm.</p>

<p>The local cotton market has been affected by the recent chaotic situation, leading to softening market sentiment. Yesterday, merchants from Han also telegraphed to stop transacting, so fine cloth has slightly declined. The goods that Han merchants had previously purchased were sold back yesterday. The local market purchased and traded 50 pieces of Blue Twin Fish cloth, priced at 6 taels, 6 qian, and 7.5 fen. 30 pieces of Blue Chicken cloth, priced at 6 taels and 3 qian. However, because merchants from Guangdong continued to purchase fine twill, Yang Crane cloth rose by 5 fen yesterday, opening at 6 taels and 7 qian. Blue Twin Fish cloth rose by 2.5 fen, opening at 6 taels, 4 qian, and 2.5 fen. 150 pieces were traded. Coarse cloth has declined across the board. Hubei Tian Zi cloth was once out of stock, but 100 pieces arrived yesterday, opening at 7 taels, 7 qian, and 7.5 fen. The situation for coarse twill remains sluggish, and local merchants are all stagnant.</p>
<p>Eastern piece goods: yesterday, eastern printed cloth had the softest trend. The reason for this is twofold: first, the local factory production is increasing daily, and the prices are all slightly lower by two to three qian. Second, the supply is plentiful, and each store has hundreds of pieces in stock, leading to a decline. Yesterday, Yang Guifei white ground opened at 4 taels and 1 qian, Double Child Deer Chong dark color opened at 4 taels, 1 qian, and 7.5 fen, and Children and Grandchildren Happiness dark flower opened at 4 taels, 3 qian, and 2.5 fen. Sales have gradually become sluggish. Among the straight tribute fabrics, only Chang Ban Qiao remains firm. Yesterday, 40 pieces of Jiang merchants box were opened at 2 qian, 7 fen, and 2.5 li. 30 pieces of eastern cotton box were opened at 2 qian and 7 fen. Yue Hua threads, Song Chong Qi Ba fabrics, which were out of stock, have arrived and are opened at 1 qian, 8 fen, and 2.5 li. However, large flower and black flower fabrics are still out of stock. Western goods have also shown signs of declining. Fuchou and feathers were down by about 5 li. Flax yarn is firm.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm silk market was strong. European and American markets showed strong demand for Shanghai factory silk. Of the 106 silk factories in Shanghai, less than half are operating. The production volume is insufficient, and supply cannot meet demand, so market sentiment is firm. Yesterday, Shen Yu and others purchased 60 bales of Shanghai white factory silk. Da Chang purchased 20 bales of factory silk. Prices were firm.</p>

<h3 id="e205">The Question of Marriage Age by Zhuo Jun <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The issue of marriage age is not just an important question within the context of marriage, but also a significant social and national issue, with connections to culture. Western countries have paid close attention to this issue for the past one hundred years or so. However, in China, there are still not many people who pay attention to this important question. According to a recent Japanese women's magazine, there is a growing trend for both men and women to marry later, and the driving force behind this trend is the increasing cost of living. Japan used to be known for its practice of early marriage, but now it seems that the custom of early marriage has been broken. In China, early marriage is still prevalent in some areas with less developed cultures. The drawbacks of early marriage are well known. For the sake of saving space, I won't go into detail. However, in marriage, the ages of the man and woman must be similar. If the man is much younger than the woman, or if the man is not yet developed while the woman is fully developed, there is a physiological need for correction.</p>
<p>According to Chen Xiao Xian's observations in Shanxi, in the early years of the Republic of China, Shanxi was characterized by marriages in which the ages of men and women were vastly different. He said that once he went to the countryside in Yuncheng and saw a strange situation: the bride was probably around twenty-one or two years old, while the groom was barely ten years old. Later, when he returned to Taiyuan, he asked several friends and learned that this custom was not only found in southern Shanxi, but also in northern Shanxi, such as Datong and Wutai. Chen also said that while this was the case in the early years of the Republic of China, he saw many similar situations when he returned to Shanxi in 1924.</p>
<p>According to Wang Hui Chuan, in the southeastern part of Anhui Province under the jurisdiction of She County, there is a place called Chang Biao Village. Boys as young as eleven or twelve years old often marry women, and the women they marry are at least eight or nine years older than them, or even ten years older. He also said that when the bride returns to her parents' home, the groom must accompany her. The bride's family hosts a banquet and always invites the groom to sit in the seat of honor. Because the groom is still wet behind the ears, he is the subject of many jokes. Sometimes, when he sees children outside the door throwing stones or playing kick shuttlecock, he doesn't realize that he is the groom and actually leaves his seat to play with the children outside.</p>
<p>The above two examples may be special cases. However, what a coincidence! I am afraid that this situation is not limited to Shanxi and Anhui. I dare not speculate whether this situation exists in other provinces. However, the fact that this situation still exists today suggests that it is not just a special phenomenon in Shanxi and Anhui. In any case, it is already wrong for boys of eleven or twelve years old to marry women, and it is especially wrong for them to marry women who are about ten years older than them. When we look at the marriage statistics from Massachusetts in the United States, we cannot find a report like the ones I mentioned above. In 1864, the average age of marriage in Massachusetts was 27 for men and 20.7 for women. In 1890, it was 27.2 for men and 24.4 for women. In 1895, it was 26.9 for men and 24.4 for women. In 1901, it was 27.3 for men and 24.6 for women. We cannot say whether their statistics are entirely reliable, but based on their statistics, we can believe that they absolutely do not allow men under the age of 20 to marry women. Also, based on their statistics, the age difference between men and women is generally only around four or five years. It is not impossible for women to marry men who are younger than them, but it is truly an obstacle to national health to have men who are not fully developed or underage marry women who are already developed or of age. If we were to say it humorously, wouldn't that be a joke?</p>
<p>It is true that in French marriage statistics, there are often cases where the age difference between men and women is around twenty years. However, this is because they marry later, and there is no phenomenon like what we see in Shanxi and Anhui. According to Berlin's 1906 marriage statistics, there were quite a few men around fifty-five years old and women around thirty-five years old. It turns out that it is a common phenomenon in modern times for the husband to be older than the wife. However, their statistics definitely do not include a situation where a man around ten years old marries a woman around twenty years old. When we look at the marriage statistics from Paris, France, we find that women who are older than their husbands make up less than 10% of the population, while couples who are the same age make up 3% to 4%. Looking at the marriage statistics from London, England, it can be seen that the majority of men who marry are over 25 years old, and the majority of women who marry are over 24 years old. It can be seen that it is a special phenomenon for men around ten years old to marry women.</p>
<p>Some say that in areas around the Indian subcontinent, both men and women marry around the age of eight or nine. This is common in India, but India is located in the tropics, and the climate is particularly warm. The development of both men and women is particularly fast. It is not uncommon for them to marry around the age of eight or nine. I am afraid that men around ten years old in China are not fully developed, and it seems that it is not physiologically appropriate for them to marry a fully developed woman.</p>
<p>There is one more point that must be mentioned in passing: the earliness or lateness of a man's or woman's marriage is related to their status in society. When they are in a certain position and it is not very good, their marriage age will be relatively earlier. On the contrary, when they are in a relatively higher position, their marriage age will often be higher. For example, miners and silk weavers in England generally marry around the age of twenty-four to twenty-six, and women generally marry around the age of twenty-two to twenty-four. Artists and shop assistants, on the other hand, must be thirty-six to twenty-eight years old before they are willing to marry, and women must be twenty-four to twenty-six years old before they are willing to marry. Lawyers and doctors, etc., who have a profession, generally do not marry until they are twenty-six to thirty years old, and women do not marry until they are twenty-six to twenty-eight or twenty-nine years old.</p>
<p>According to a recent Japanese correspondence in Life (Volume 5, Number 10), Japanese women generally do not marry until they are twenty-two or twenty-three years old, and men generally do not marry until they are twenty-six or twenty-seven years old. It can be seen that the marriage of men and women should follow physiological principles. In inland China, the patriarchal system still dominates. Fathers can't wait for their sons to marry early so that they can have grandsons as soon as possible, regardless of whether their sons are fully developed or whether the woman they marry their sons is too old and will affect or harm their sons' development.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to declare that this article has no system and makes no concrete contribution to the question of marriage age. However, this article aims to expose a special marriage situation in inland China and hopes that those who have the responsibility to guide and advise will think of a proper way to stop it.</p>
