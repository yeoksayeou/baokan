<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c33">一月來世界新生之事 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>記者從一月以來。將報紙上零零碎碎發見世界新起之幾件事。約略紀述。關於亞洲方面者。朝鮮有青年反日運動。越南有醖釀革命騒動。印度有要求獨立非武力抵抗運動。菲律濱有組織代表團請願實行獨立運動阿富汗有廢王陰謀起事運。動關於歐洲方面者。西班牙有推倒狄克推多要求復憲之事波羅的海區域内戰後新興之小國。如愛沙尼亞有圖謀暗殺總統之事。立陶宛有圖謀暗殺外交總長之事關於美洲方面者墨西哥總统。被競選之反對黨刺傷。巴西副總統。被暴動黨徒擊傷。</p>
<p>以上所。述各事。皆含有政治意味總合觀察不外民族主義。隨同民治主義劇烈發展而已。淪於殖民附屬地之民族。則進而要求獨立第一步之自治。有自治資格之。民族。則進而要求完全獨立。朝鮮越南印度菲律濱等之運動是也。已成獨立之國而尙在專制政治下者。則進而要求復憲旣復憲政。則要求實行共和如西班牙今日之情勢是也。旣成共和之國權力操於各黨派。急激派必反對温和派。於是選舉時有黨派之競爭。競爭不已。則起紛擾如墨西哥今日之情勢是也其餘數小國所起政治上之爭執。原因雖未詳。當亦不脫此種層累而進之範圍。可以測世界政治進步之急速矣。</p>
<p>若從民生問題觀察。今日各大國。如英美法日等。則非特無進步。且有倒退之勢吾人不必詳細列舉祇觀各國工廠。屢告停歇。失業工人屢見增加。金融界屢起風潮。絶無穏定之象。商業界屢陷頽勢、絶不振起之機。民生主義與民治主義之進程。確有矛盾衝突之勢。則絶非世界之好現象。世界如是一國亦何獨不然也。</p>

<p>關於這次的裁判員我提起了裁判員、人們恐怕要疑惑我一定是失敗而諉過他人了、其實比賽之後、裁判員三字、是不應再提的、不過這次的裁判員、却和我們發生了絶大的關係、所以我不得不趁這機會、把此次關於裁判的種種、公諸國人、</p>
<p>在未談别事之先、我要首先聲明、我並不敢說我們此番失敗、是裁判員之過、我並没有說他是存偏袒的心、我記得某報界中人、曾對我狠熱地安慰、他說你們這次如果任裁判的是外國人、或稍存公正人、恐怕你們斷不致於失敗罷、他的安慰我的誠意、我是狠感激的、不過他的論調、我却不大十分贊同、</p>
<p>但是在我相信他不致於偏袒當中、我却對他有數點不滿意的地方、我們這次三塲的比賽、都是葉九臯君一人担任裁判、第一塲對方中衛頻頻向我施以暴動、必以傷我爲快、我敢信他的存心、是北華東隊内任何隊員、來得不良、他的舉動、是比任何人來得粗野、葉君對此、並不加以敬告、而反常常向我說、你不要理他、</p>
<p>第二塲比賽原定的九十分鐘過了外、尙多了十二分鐘、據葉君說、因爲賽時替換球員補上去的而華南隊反敗爲和那一隻球、却凑巧在臨完的兩分鐘内踼進、而且賽和之後、例應照第一塲般延長、但葉君說晚色太深、不能繼續、於是氣力不繼的華南隊、又得免於失敗、以上葉君見解、和補時的理由、我且不論其當否、不過有一次當我們左翼带球猛攻時、葉君忽然鳴笛、原來華南隊裏某中衛因傷倒地、故爾中止、葉君爲港會錄取之裁判員、對此不應停賽處而停賽、實在使我大惑不解、如果葉君以爲是應該停賽的、那嗎我們下次遇着敵人進襲時、祇要一人詐傷臥地、便可解圍了、</p>

<p>余自幼即入外國語學校肄業、至民國十二年於約翰卒業了即至美國留學、没有同我國字典相親近的機會、又没有我國小學的研究、然而我忽然想想我要改良我國的字典、欲以自已的意見替代我國數千年來習用的方法、你想起來、這種事情豈不是（駭人聽聞）麽、豈不是（不能相信）的麽雖然如此、我們都知道天下的人非盡可料天下的事的、若使天下的人盡可料定天下的事、那麽天下字典之中即可减去（寄）字一個字了、我開始研案這冷僻的問題、因爲感觸於美國檢字法的利便、美國求學的不難、與夫我國檢字的太難、我國求學的太不利便、美國求學不難的原因、因爲英文各字都按照Ａ·Ｂ·Ｃ·Ｄ·二十六個字母順次排律的、中國求學不利便、因爲中國未有字母、未有简便易學的檢字方法、</p>
<p>檢字方法爲目錄學（Ｉｎｄｅｘｓｃｉｅｎｃｅ）的根基、我國學生於目錄學一門、大多不屑加以研究的、他們並不知道、目錄之學實爲讀書求學獨一無二的帮助、懂得目錄的人、一人圖書館、即可利用其圖書目錄以尋出一切有關係的書籍、一書在手、即可利用其内容細目以析出全書的精華、能够在最簡短的時間、尋出最多數的事物、没有這種研究、雖然入了圖書館、没有帮助不能找出相關的書籍、有書在手、非久讀不能尋出所求的字物、我今日發明在漢字檢查方法上下推其緣故因爲我在美國讀書的時候、曾經有過一番目錄學的研究、我希望進個簡易方法發明以後、我國目錄之學逐日可以發達、對於國故即日可以（整理）、求學方法日日可以利便、</p>
<p>向來檢字方法最流行於我國的、就是部首檢字法、漢初的許愼說文、清初的康熙字典、都是根本此法而編纂成功的、</p>
<p>康熙字典的二百一十四部首、分配極不均匀、其中（人）（口）（心）（手）（水）（木）（金）（草）（糸）（虫）（言）十一大部約佔全書之字的二分之一、而生僻之部首、（即所含之字不足二十個者）如（人）（口）（卜）（厶）等等、都一百二十部省不過一千餘字、</p>
<p>康熙字典所分部首之界限、極不分明、明明可人甲部之字結底却屬於乙部、我亦不必多說、至筆畫一項、何者應連爲一筆、何者應分爲兩筆、亦無一定之標準、很不容易猜到那部首、還要計算筆畫、於十多個或廿多個同筆畫的部首内尋求其部的頁數翻到了頁數、又須再計算筆畫、在同一部首、同一筆畫、數十個或數百個字中（王雲五說草部八畫有二百零五字草部九畫有二百零四字）一一留心、搜尋一過、如果仍尋不着、就要多費二倍工夫、在多一筆或少一筆裏再等、如果又尋不着、祇好另費一番大大的手續、計算全字筆畫的總數、向檢字表中數百個字中再求之、（檢字表中七畫至十二畫所容之字均在二三百以上）如此看來、欲求區區一字的意義、必須費去二三番手續、經過很長的時光、數過數十個至數百個無關的字、才僥倖尋得所求之字、你想麻煩不麻煩、（未完）</p>

<p>長興僻處山陬。弁峰十二。綿延不絶。而尤以碧巖爲最高大。石壁千仭。矗立雲際。珠簾水即濴洄其間。迨至缺口之處。倒流直瀉。勢甚湍急。陡成瀑布。高約三丈許。遠而望之。如長空白練。自天而下。汨汨之聲。晝夜不息。土人常引之以灌田。其下即爲捨身譚。潭水不廣。屈曲向東北流。經大蕩漾而入於太湖。蓋太湖爲浙西衆流所歸之一巨浸也。考珠簾水之遠源。發於碧巖之天雞嶺。相距可三里。每當黄梅水漲。來勢益湧。傾瀉不及。則自　際噴射而出。珠飛玉濺。更覺大觀。最奇者。天久不雨。寖成亢旱。此水斷不至因涸絶流。或謂天雞泉源。上承天目。殆亦足信。現聞本邑弁鄉區委員。奉令調查。亟事建設。倘能更新而擴大之。則苕西風景。定爲湖山生色不少云。</p>
<h3 id="c117">江北剿匪之所聞 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 綺</p>
<p>江北通如一带。素號安謐。乃比歲以來。匪氛大熾。各地民衆。寢饋不安。茲就耳聞目擊者。寫以寄本談。</p>
<p>自衛殲匪通境東鄉某鎭。有某氏聚族而居。族皆富有。少者數萬金。多至數十萬。因鑒于匪勢兇猛。屢遭垂涎。乃合力謀所以禦匪之方。一方築防禦工事。一方辦槍械。實力頗充。並有手提機關槍探海燈等。某夜一巡邏員于瞭望台用探海燈視察。遙見數里外黑影憧憧。有如蟻羣。疾奔而來。其勢甚猛。乃向天空開排槍。槍發而前奔如故。復向人叢中射去。仍無效。且愈趨愈近。時距屋已不過遠。乃發機關槍掃射。匪始退。下台檢視。被擊倒地者。計九十餘人。多爲佃農隣居。手則持農具。執其未斃者詢之。則謂被共黨所脅迫而來。不遵者即遭槍殺。行時匪殿衆後。退縮者死。故若輩進死。退亦死。實出無可如何云。</p>
<p>會勦失約。通如交界之如屬鎭濤鄉。爲共黨嘯聚之巢窟。該區被匪攻陷之後。歷時數月。官兵不到。遂爲匪所盤據。行政公安局等局悉被毁去。且滋長不已。成通屬平潮區之大患。南通縣長陳步蟾。素以治匪著名。以民不聊生。乃邀約如臯縣長。會同勦滅。屆期午夜。通境軍隊動員。奮勇圍攻。乃如臯縣長竟爽約。於是坐視共黨匪首從容向知境逸去、千載良機。失之</p>
<p>交臂、滋可惋惜。而通地軍警。尤爲憤激。蓋萬一被匪擊敗。俟如臯之援兵不至。豈非全軍覆没。刻聞地方當局。已向如臯政府提出嚴重質問矣。</p>
<p>梟首示衆。勦共告捷後。將一匪之首級懸掛示衆。以快人心而寒匪膽。十一日携至平潮鎭。縣於路口之石柱上。一時環而觀者如堵。匪面黄如金紙。狀尙不甚可怖。予喟然曰。固一時之雄也。而今安在哉。夫人類相殘。殺機大開。雖匪死固有餘辜。然世變至是。亦良可悲矣。</p>

<p>— 蘭因</p>
<p>近數年來。沛縣發生不少離婚案。並聯带發生種種笑話。以内地而有此現象。殊可異也。最著者。如前此之張碧月案。轟傳全國。碧月與吳姓離異。其姊與郝姓離異。致釀成槍斃黄長典之慘禍。滬上新劇塲。且取其事實。演諸紅氍毹上。想閱者猶能憶之。邇復發生一當塲試騐之趣史。乃大類剖腹騐花。幸有縣長作魯連。善言勸解。夫婦得和好如初。初有某姓者。貎甚寢。曾卒業中學。故學識尙富。適與一般金玉其外而敗絮其中者相反。其妻則美而慧。結婚已三載。從未生育。即以其夫貎寢。於邑不歡。勃谿之聲。時聞户外。徒擁夫婦虚名。無夫婦之幸福、蓄意離婚也久矣。自受新潮流簸蕩。心志愈决。卒因一事反目。奔赴縣政府。請求判離。縣長傳某至。問願離否。曰願。惟妻腹中已有孕。是我骨血。應還我。妻瞋目曰。何嘗有孕。是故意留難也。因袒腹示縣長。又曰。有孕無孕。不難一撫而知。縣長爲之大窘。某仍堅執前言。曰。月份尚淺。自不得形於外。安可以一撫而即知者。妻乃大憤。厲聲曰。然則請縣長剖騐之。以明究竟。言次。自捧其袒露之腹。要求即剖。縣長至此。知某猶不願離。即改顏勸慰。尋其妻亦頓覺剖腹騐胎。攸關生命。已稍稍氣餒。而羞惡之念又乘之。不禁俯首。遂隨其夫而歸。</p>

<p>疇昔之夜。趙君蘭亭宴客於覺林。逸梅亦與其盛焉。濟濟蹌蹌中。得識革命前輩姚雨平先生。先生癯貎微髭。頭已班白。作嶺兩語。温靄可親。近爲海上寓公。杜門謝客。不問治亂。耽於禪悅。終日靜坐。曰。一切眞理。均可於靜坐中悟之。否則唪經誦佛。徒見其形式耳。洵屬名言。覺林不備酒。而駱君亮公非杯中物不歡。特命役者沽之。酒酣。爲述曩飲於某家。嘗四十年之宿醪。味淡而和醇。不覺傾觴者再。主人力阻之曰。宿醪不宜多飲。恐酕醄也。予方以爲主人之吝。未盡量而罷。及辭出。凉風吹來。目炫而首昏昏然。幾不能自持。始知宿醪之力有如此。母怪主人之力阻也。同座某君因稱其家藏有荔枝酒。昔王十朋食荔枝。有如何敢啗玉堂紅句。遂襲以玉堂紅之佳名。法於仲夏時。剝鮮荔枝。投之於高梁酒中。加以相堂之氷糖。然後密封不見風日。十年後發醅飲之。厥色殷紅。甘芳質厚。有健胃之功。爲市上所未有。錢君化佛乃預乞一　。他日願以遍享諸知好。俾得共領瓊漿玉液滋味也。</p>

<p>▲蒲台爾之死</p>
<p>（二）喪儀</p>
<p>那第二天。上午天氣墨黑。欲雨不雨。是很沉悶的天氣。下午二點將近。滿天湧起黄霧。像也在那裏爲這彫刻大師的死而悲哀。三點過了。蕭女士。彭師勤。傳雷。張弦。都羣集於ｒｕｅ　ｄｅ　ｌａ　Ｓｏｒｂｏｎｎｅ二十號我的畫室裏。我們便坐了摩托車。向Ｉｍｐａｓｓｅ　ｄｕ　Ｍａｒｎｅ　去。這不但因爲要瞻仰這位大人物的遺骸。也因爲想看看這位大師許多未曾發表過的絶作。</p>
<p>（英雄崇拜）是人人的共同心理。尤其是我的特癖。所以我並不諱我的（接近大人物）。這次我到歐洲研究。、順便也想多瞻仰幾個英雄。畫家享利瑪蒂斯。保白羅畢克梭。安特勒獨朗。逢娜。詩人梵刺利。文豪羅曼羅蘭。彫刻家昂杜安蒲台爾。都是我預定要見的。現在蒲台爾在我將要會見他之先。突然死了。我的心。是如何的愴傷呵。</p>
<p>汽車疾駛於市街之際。正是傾盆大雨。這使我更感凄感了。在大路轉右。一排略带茶黄色的短牆。攀附着縱横的老藤。實在是古色蒼然。大門前站着四個巡警。多數的人。憧憧出入。我們汽車也停了。傳君便走上去。脫着帽子問道。（蒲台爾先生的ｌｓｔｅｌｉｅｒ就在這裏麽）。</p>
<p>其中有花白鬍鬚而身材很長的一個回答道。（這裏正是。）</p>
<p>走進去院子裏的幾株大樹。也像抵不過風威霜力那樣。一片片的黄色枯葉。不斷的飄堕在我們頭頂上。再進去數十步。左面就有嵌滿玻璃窗的高大的烏黑的一所建築物。像暴露在二三十年的風雨中。這便是有名的蒲台爾的Ｌａｔｅｌｉｅｒ。我望着那一排很長的玻璃窗門時。心裏想。蒲台爾不斷的創作了不朽的神奇的許多傑作。大槪便是在那間屋子罷。</p>
<p>正門呢。因爲正値下雨。黑到像黄昏。ｌａｔｅｌｉｅｒ裏面點着雪亮的電燈。去參與喪儀的人很多。我們浴着暴雨。立在門外。兩個司儀者穿着黑黑的禮服。頸上套着很粗的銀鍊。酒刺滿面的紅臉。頭髮和鬍鬚的金黄。很惹人注目。他們很恭肅地請來賓一一簽名。魚貫進去。很嚴肅虔敬的進了門。中間安置着蒲台爾的遺骸。四面都堆着無數的鮮花。尤其是後面的花圈堆到屋頂那樣高。兩支三尺長的白蠟。置在遺骸的左右。幽黯的燭光。向風中抖動。現出沈憂凄斷之色。左面的一角。高高置着羅丹的彫像。爲紀念他那先師奥古斯羅丹的風采計。蒲台爾便作這位大藝人的像。運思的雙目。蒼勁而寛廣的前額。輝耀着神奇的風采。這裏所表現的深思的崇偉的大藝人的神氣。眞可以說是施行極大胆的象徵底羅丹的全人的面目。躍然如見了。下面還彫着（我師羅丹。）在左面置着二十尺高八尺闊的一座浮型泥塑。是還没有製作完成的一個大規模的構思。正面一座大作品。是渾然巨大的個幻像。左手直伸出去。渾身肌肉像獅子怒吼那樣緊張。像巴比倫Ｂａｂｙｌｒｏｎｉａ亞細里亞Ａｓｓｙｒｉａ詭怪的巨像那種面目。眞是一種大胆的嘗試。四面還有許多他最近的作品。因爲在那嚴肅的喪儀中。我們不能一件一件細看。浦台爾夫人以及其他親屬。都蒙着烏黑的喪服。坐在遺骸的一邊。多數的來賓肅然立於周圍輪流去致敬。去瞻仰遺容。我也跑前去瞻仰瞻仰。他的臉粗看像是一個三角形。頭頂全秃。前額寛廣而凸起。兩邊腦角上還各有一批全白的頭髮。一直聯絡到下巴尖的鬍鬚。顴象很寛。雙目深窈。像安睡那樣。他的口是緊閉着。他雖然死了。從他的臉部。却還是表現着清奇的深沉的光輝的丰采。</p>
<p>不多久。弔客愈集愈多了。一個八十多歲的老人。進門就大哭起來。他說在十日以前還得到他的來信。昨晨知道噩耗。特地來巴黎的。現在與他永别了。許多人勸慰他。扶他過去與蒲台爾夫人坐在一起。還是不成聲的哭。一室靜悄悄地更森嚴而凄清了。</p>
<p>大奇怪了。我們站了一小時之久。竟不願離開這ｌａｔｅｌｉｅｒ後來的人太多。實在不容我們再留。我便再三的回顧。離開這屋子了。</p>

<p>(Beiping) A certain important person in Shanxi stated that rumors should not be fully believed. Yan advocates for peace and has repeatedly expressed this. For example, during the last telegram from Tang Shengzhi and others, Yan resolutely opposed the reorganization faction and supported the Central Government, which is clear evidence of his stance. In any case, Yan is determined not to use force to resolve political issues. Even in the past when Shanxi participated in military actions, it was only limited to passive self-defense. Therefore, the current situation is not very critical. It is hoped that the press will not excessively promote it, as it may make it difficult to change course later. A foreigner from Taiyuan said that Yan's attitude is stable. He has advocated for peace in the past and has not made military preparations.

He used repeated analogies and his words were extremely thorough. He concluded by saying that the Three Principles of the People are a good prescription for saving China and unifying it, and are a product that China urgently needs in reality. Leading the national revolution to realize the Three Principles of the People is the responsibility of our party comrades. We only need to pay attention to examining our own words and actions to see if they deviate from the Premier's principles, violate the party's discipline, abandon the responsibility of the revolution, or lose the spirit of the revolution. If this is not the case, then no force, no threat, and no temptation will be enough to shake our revolutionary belief. We must fight the counter-revolutionary forces to the end.

<h3 id="e33">Events of Rebirth in the World in One Month <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Since January, the reporter has recorded several new events occurring in the world from newspaper clippings. Regarding Asia, there have been anti-Japanese movements by youth in Korea, rumblings of revolutionary disturbances in Vietnam, non-violent resistance movements demanding independence in India, and organizations of delegations petitioning for independence in the Philippines. There have been plots to overthrow the king and start an uprising in Afghanistan. Regarding Europe, there has been the overthrow of the dictatorship in Spain and demands for the restoration of the constitution. In the Baltic Sea region, newly emerging small countries after the war, such as Estonia, have seen plots to assassinate the president, and Lithuania has seen plots to assassinate the foreign minister. Regarding the Americas, the President of Mexico was stabbed by the opposition party in the election, and the Vice President of Brazil was shot by rioters.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned events all contain political implications. Observing them collectively, they are nothing more than nationalism, accompanied by the vigorous development of democracy. Nations that have fallen into colonial dependencies are advancing to demand independence, the first step being autonomy. Nations with the qualifications for autonomy are advancing to demand complete independence. The movements in Korea, Vietnam, India, the Philippines, etc., are examples of this. Countries that have already achieved independence but are still under autocratic politics are advancing to demand the restoration of the constitution. Once constitutional government is restored, they demand the implementation of a republic, as is the current situation in Spain. Countries that have already achieved republican status have power wielded by various parties. Radical factions are bound to oppose moderate factions. Thus, there is competition between parties during elections. When competition does not cease, disturbances arise, as is the current situation in Mexico. Although the reasons for the political disputes in the other small countries are not known in detail, they are unlikely to fall outside this range of layered and progressive development. The rapid progress of world politics can be measured.</p>
<p>If observed from the perspective of people's livelihood issues, today's major countries, such as the UK, the US, France, and Japan, not only lack progress but also show signs of regression. We need not list them in detail. Simply observe the factories of various countries, which repeatedly announce closures, the number of unemployed workers repeatedly increases, and financial circles repeatedly experience turmoil, with no signs of stability. The business community repeatedly falls into decline, with no chance of recovery. The progress of the Principle of People's Livelihood and the Principle of Democracy do indeed have a tendency of contradiction and conflict, which is by no means a good phenomenon for the world. If the world is like this, how can any one country be any different?</p>

<p>British Foreign Secretary Speaks on the Conference Situation</p>
<p>Tardieu Postpones Trip to Britain Due to Illness</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Japan Allied News Agency): London dispatch of the 16th: The plenary session of the three-nation conference of Britain, Japan, and the United States is scheduled for 3:00 PM on the 17th. The representatives of Britain, Japan, and the United States will meet together to discuss important concrete issues. This will be the first such meeting. It is reliably learned that this three-nation meeting was established at the initiative of the United States. The United States may, according to its established policy, request that the issue of auxiliary vessels be discussed first. However, since the three nations' positions on battleships are already clear, and there is hope that the issue of auxiliary vessels will be easier to negotiate, it is also possible that the issue of battleships will be discussed first. According to reliable sources, the United States' proposed battleship construction plan has met with opposition not only from other countries, but also with considerable criticism within the United States. As a result, it seems likely that the plan will be withdrawn in the near future.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Electric Communication News Agency): The disarmament conference has reached its fourth week, and this week is considered the most important for deliberations. The closely watched three-nation meeting of Britain, Japan, and the United States is scheduled for the 17th. This meeting will focus on the differences between Japan and the United States and strive to find a solution. On the Japanese side, Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki will take on the role of negotiator. On the British side, while directly related countries participate in planning, they also report on the efforts of mediation. In addition to addressing the tonnage of each type of warship, both Japan and the United States will present overall figures. The meeting on the 17th will address the core of the issue, present arguments frankly, and be a meeting to decide whether Japan's 70% demand will be passed.</p>
<p>London, 16th (Reuters): Foreign Secretary Henderson spoke yesterday at Berkhampsted, mentioning the naval conference. He said that the participants are currently studying the details, and when encountering difficulties that must be resolved, resolutions cannot be reached quickly, and the public is somewhat disappointed. This is inevitable for any international conference. The most important thing is how to deal with such difficulties. The British government believes that the people of all countries should have the right to approve a significant reduction in armaments, and the representatives of all countries participating in the naval conference are well aware that concluding a disarmament agreement is indispensable to the livelihood needs of all countries. The abolition of submarines has been discussed. Britain uniquely advocated the abolition of submarines at the Washington Conference. Now other countries have moved towards this concept. Although the current situation proves that the naval conference cannot reach an agreement on the abolition of submarines, the movement for active restriction and eventual abolition should receive a powerful impetus. These words can also be applied to battleships, which currently account for a large portion of naval expenditure. The British government has clearly stated that it wants to unanimously reduce battleships and hopes that the abolition of battleships will be possible soon. The naval reporter for the Observer discussed the future of submarines, saying that it would be too much to regard them as maritime weapons. The secret installations of submarines after the war are very developed, so the effectiveness of submarines is extremely subtle, because they can never move on or under the water without being noticed. From a purely humanitarian point of view, abolishing submarines would benefit everyone. The time for submarines has passed. It would be better to use the money used to maintain submarine teams for more beneficial ships, but it would be even better to leave it in the pockets of taxpayers.</p>
<p>Paris, 16th (Reuters): French Prime Minister Tardieu, also the French chief representative to the naval conference, is currently suffering from influenza and laryngitis and has delayed his return to London.</p>

<p>Proletarian Factions Hold Significant Sway</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Electric Communication News Agency): Regarding the outcome of the general election, according to observations from a fair and impartial standpoint, the Democratic Party will secure 230 seats, the Seiyukai 200 seats, small parties 20 seats, and the remaining seats will be occupied by various proletarian factions. The Democratic Party has abundant funds, with recognized candidates generally receiving 6,000 yuan each. Going forward, they will conduct surprise attacks using substantial methods while guarding against the propaganda of the opposition party, informing the nation of the importance of the current political situation. Furthermore, they will provide considerable assistance to neutral legislators of the Democratic Party who are not officially recognized. Therefore, no matter how one estimates, they will definitely not fall below 230 seats. On the other hand, the Seiyukai's military resources are far inferior to those of the Democratic Party, making it practically difficult to hope to exceed 200 seats. In the previous election, small parties had 50 candidates, but this time only the National Comrades Association has 12 candidates and the Innovation Party has 6. It is extremely difficult to predict how many of them will be elected. Even if there is an increase, it will only be two or three. There were 150 neutral candidates in the previous election, but only 65 this time, almost a 50% reduction. Therefore, combining the small parties and neutral factions, about 20 seats can be expected to be won. This is the general expectation. As for the proletarian parties, judging from the current situation, although only 5 candidates are certain to be elected,</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>the final result may be 17 or 18 seats. Suzuki Bunji and Nishio Suehiro, former legislators, are not optimistic due to the split of the Social Democratic Party. Among the new candidates, Tetsuo Katayama of Kanagawa Prefecture's Second District is the most promising. The certainty of his party's election is almost unshakable. Among the other former legislators who can be expected to be elected with certainty (proletarian faction) are Isoo Abe, Matataro Kawakami, Kenzo Asahara, and Kanichiro Kamei, among others.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Electric Communication News Agency): According to the observations of the Seiyukai leadership, the current situation of the national general election is relatively favorable to the Seiyukai. Those already secured for election are 208 officially recognized candidates and 7 unofficially recognized candidates, totaling 215. It will not be difficult to add further effort and reach 225 seats. On the other hand, the Democratic Party currently has 205 secure seats, which is largely certain. If future interference, suppression, and bribery prove effective, it is possible to increase by 17 or 18 seats, reaching 222 or 223 seats. Therefore, the difference between the Democratic and Seiyukai parties will be negligible, and the decision-making power in the future will fall into the hands of the proletarian and neutral factions outside of the two parties. However, according to the Seiyukai's observation, the number of seats won by each faction will be 4 for the National Comrades Association, 2 for the Innovation Party, 11 for the neutral faction, and 13 for the various proletarian factions. Among them, 7 are supporters of the Seiyukai and 8 are supporters of the Democratic Party. As a result, the power of decision remains in the hands of the proletarian faction.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Japan Allied News Agency): With only three days remaining in the political battle to determine the political landscape, the consequences of failure for the government party would be quite serious. It is possible that the current cabinet will resign en masse. The government and the party are wholeheartedly working towards the established goal of obtaining an absolute majority. Prime Minister Hamaguchi, who went to the major cities of the Kansai region to campaign, returned to Tokyo on the morning of the 17th and decided to work closely with Home Minister Adachi in the central government to develop the final countermeasures for the election battle.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Electric Communication News Agency): Inui, the president of the Seiyukai, who is campaigning among landowners, went to Osaka after holding a large rally at the Kotobuki-za Theater in Hiroshima City yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Tariff Truce Conference Opens <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Britain Takes the Initiative to Convene</p>
<p>Only of Preparatory Nature</p>
<p>Geneva, 17th (Reuters): The Tariff Truce Conference opened today. Chairman Count Moltke stated that the discussions at this conference have a significant relationship with the economic construction of Europe and the world. The conference is expected to last about two or three weeks. The British delegation expects to achieve satisfactory results. The British delegation issued a statement today correcting misunderstandings about the conference, saying that the conference is not to make tariff-related transactions, but to discuss setting a tariff holiday in order to open the way for future negotiations to eliminate commercial barriers.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Associated Press): According to today's news, the Japanese representatives attending the International Tariff Conference convened by the League of Nations in Geneva have no intention of taking active measures and are temporarily adopting a wait-and-see attitude. The purpose of this conference is to discuss ways for countries to avoid tariff competition in the next two or three years. Most of the issues are limited to Europe, so the United States has not sent representatives to attend. It is reported that this conference is of a preparatory nature, and a conference will be convened in the future to discuss ways for participating countries to unanimously reduce tariffs. The number of countries attending today is between 28 and 30. All European countries except Albania are participating. The only non-European country is Cuba. Brazil and Santo Domingo have also sent representatives to observe. The initiator of this conference is the United Kingdom, and the United Kingdom naturally hopes to take the lead in the conference. However, British dependencies such as South Africa, Australia, India, New Zealand, and Egypt have all refused to join, which is puzzling, leading to speculation. A large number of people in Japan have advocated free trade for many years, but the results have been minimal, because Japan's main foreign markets, such as the United States, implement high tariff policies.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Memorial Week for Central Government and National Government <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held the 47th memorial week for the premier at the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters at 9:00 AM on the 17th. Those present were members of the Central Committee, including Hu Hanmin, Sun Ke, Wu Jingheng, He Yingqin, Ye Chucang, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Zhang Daofan, Liu Luyin, Ma Chaojun, and Yu Jingtang, as well as staff from various departments and guests, totaling about six or seven hundred people. Chen Guofu chaired the meeting. After the ceremony, Wu Jingheng reported, saying that since the military campaign, armed comrades have suffered great sacrifices and pain. As a result of their efforts, they have achieved military victory, and it is fortunate that it has come to an end. We hope that the country can achieve some stability and give the people an opportunity to recover. Unexpectedly, Mr. Yan from Taiyuan sent an outlandish telegram out of the blue. Mr. Yan has always been known for his prudence, and everyone knows that he is cautious in his dealings. Now, I don't know why he was influenced by something impure. The telegram was very rough, and seemed to lack refinement. When I went to Taiyuan last year, I thought he was very steady. When I asked him about his political views, he expressed them very simply and reasonably. First, to suppress bandits in various places. Second, to consolidate national defense. Third, to reorganize finance. I believe this is the fundamental blueprint for governing the country and should be followed. Judging by his expression, I did not think that he harbored any ambition. When I left Taiyuan and went to Qingdao, I read in the newspapers that President Chiang was also determined to rectify these points. I felt that our political views were in agreement and was optimistic about the future. But how long has it been? He lost his original appearance. He criticized the use of force in the telegram. Although force is an ominous term, if it is abused because of personal ambition, it is indeed inappropriate. But if internal unrest in the country continues unabated, how can it be quelled without resorting to force? Confucius once said that there has never been anyone who does not like to defy his superiors and likes to cause trouble. Zeng Guofan's caution and fear led him to fight in more than ten provinces. His doctrine was also to quell unrest. As for fighting, the one who acts first bears a greater burden of blame. But if the first mover is allowed to have the opportunity to act, the one who retaliates must resign together. How can this be? He also advocated convening the first, second, and third executive and supervisory committee members to resolve national affairs. This is a direct attempt to form a grand alliance of the so-called Western Hills Conference faction, reorganization faction, nationalist faction, and research faction. Whether this can be achieved in fact and whether it will benefit national affairs is obvious to anyone with intelligence. In terms of reasons, it is not worth studying. In terms of ambition, he does not regard the entire army as a national army, but wants to use national funds to support his personal army. If he does not repent immediately, I am afraid that the name of an ambitious person will be impossible for him to explain, even with a hundred mouths. Zhao Cilong telegraphed that there is a possibility of redemption. I deeply hope that he can awaken and prevent the country from having any more dangerous storms, which would be fortunate for the country. After the report, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>The National Government held the weekly memorial service for the Premier at 10:00 am on the same day. Those present were Chiang Kai-shek, Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Zhu Shouguang, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Yang Zhaotai, Wang Zhengting, Yi Peiji, Wei Daoming, and more than 300 officers from the National Government secretariat and military departments. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek presided over the ceremony. Afterwards, Secretary Qian Changzhao gave the following political report: (The International League of Nations is scheduled to convene a conference to compile international law in The Hague on March 13, which may result in the drafting of conventions and declarations, which is very important. The purpose of this conference is to study three major issues: (1) Nationality, (2) Territorial Waters, (3) State's Responsibility for the Life and Property of Foreigners. The notification from the League of Nations was issued before August. The United States and other countries have studied it in detail (and have published special books. Our country has only recently paid attention to it, and therefore feels that our country lags behind in everything internationally. There is a lack of diplomatic talent, which is indeed undeniable. No matter what problem arises, it is difficult to find a suitable person. If one is quick to get the information and prepare early, one will not be too hasty. Unfortunately, the information is slow, and this conference is a good example of being completely unprepared. There are many such things. I hope the diplomatic authorities and overseas embassies and consulates will make special efforts. The issue of provisional courts is about to be resolved. Officials from our country's diplomatic and judicial authorities are discussing the matter with the committees sent by various countries. After 28 meetings, a draft of the new agreement was drafted, and it will be published after signing. Because the Shanghai concession has not been recovered and the administrative power is in the hands of others, it is difficult to avoid taking reality into account. In short, the recovery of the concessions is the most important task of diplomacy today. Once the concessions are recovered, all problems will naturally be solved. Today, I have a personal opinion to offer to everyone. Since eliminating Tang Shengzhi, the central government has ended its military campaign and is putting all its energy into clarifying politics. On the passive side, such as initiating thrift movements. On the active side, all the concrete plans for reforming politics are in preparation. At this turning point in the country's fortune, loyal comrades must take responsibility, regardless of success or failure, and work with a clear conscience. Do as much as you can. This is the revolutionary spirit. Revolution is progressive, not regressive, linear, not curved. If we follow the tide and worry about gains and losses, we will lose our revolutionary personality. We must know that following the tide and worrying about gains and losses is nothing more than being selfish and not public, being motivated by profit and not by justice. As a result, rebellions have repeatedly occurred in our country recently, and the forces of the revolution itself have split and dispersed. This is also because people in general are selfish and not public, driven by profit and not by justice. If this mentality is not changed, the revolution will not succeed. As for the national citizens who have sacrificed so much over the years, the central government is very concerned and wants them to recover their vitality. We must ensure that society is peaceful. However, after several wars in the country and the disturbances of the bandits and communists, the citizens are like startled birds and are very difficult to calm down. Even an ordinary rumor, an atmosphere, or an assertion, an expression, or a brewing from any side can cause those who are tired of chaos to doubt, and those who like chaos to rejoice, and society will be shaken as a result. I hope that all those in positions should be particularly cautious, and if there are any errors, the central government and the national citizens should correct them.)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Join Forces to Suppress Lake Bandits <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Hu Brigade Commander Orders Military and Police of Both Provinces</p>
<p>To Launch a Major Joint Suppression Starting on the 17th</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are actively planning to eliminate the bandits in Taihu Lake. The central government has appointed Hu Zuyu, the commander of the 5th Division and 14th Brigade, as the commander-in-chief of the Taihu Lake Bandit Suppression, and established the headquarters in Suzhou. The Zhejiang Province will be commanded by Sun Changjun, the commander of the 155th Brigade of the 52nd Division. Starting on the 15th, both provinces will mobilize simultaneously. The destination of the gathering is the second regiment commander of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Force, Hang Yi, and the third district chief of the inland waterway police, Xu Pucheng. They have mobilized their troops and opened up to the lake area. Today (the 17th), there was another order from Commander-in-Chief Hu to implement the general joint suppression. After receiving the order, Brigade Commander Sun, Regiment Commander Hang, and District Chief Xu immediately joined forces to advance and search, and chose to defend key points. The period of intense fighting will not be far off.</p>
<p>It is heard that the planes sent by the central government will also fly over the lake surface at the same time to侦察 bandit activity in order to wipe them out in one fell swoop.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Ye Kaixin Inspects Troops in Wuhu <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Ye Kaixin, commander of the 52nd Division, having taken office, had inspected Sun Changjun's 155th Brigade stationed in Hangzhou and other places. However, Zhang Zhongfu's 154th Brigade stationed in Anhui had not yet been inspected. Now that the headquarters is planning comprehensive training for soldiers of all divisions, Ye specially came to Anhui from Beijing a few days ago, first going to Anqing to inspect his troops. Today, he took the Anfeng special steamer and arrived in Wuhu at 10 a.m. to inspect the troops stationed in Wuhu. After disembarking, Ye lodged at the Jiaotong Hotel on Zhongshan Road. Those accompanying him were Chief Secretary Li Yannian, Adjutant-General Le Yihong, as well as various directors of staff and adjutant offices, messengers, etc. At 3 p.m., he began inspecting the soldiers of the 123rd Regiment of the 154th Brigade at the Taikoo Wharf, under the command of Brigade Commander Zhang Zhongfu. After the inspection, he gave a speech to the officers and soldiers, saying that the revolutionary army is the military force of the people, and if there are any improprieties in the stationed troops, he hoped that the people would point them out. I once asked whether Ma Hongkui had already assumed the post of Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Anhui, and whether Ma's troops would be entirely transferred to Anhui for stationing. Ye said that since Ma was responsible for the security of the entire Anhui, the troops would naturally be transferred to Anhui. When he was in Anqing, the advance station of Ma's troops had already arrived. After that unit arrived in Anqing, the 1st Regiment of Li Shulin and Sen's 154th Brigade would immediately cede its defense and move to the Datong and Wuhu area to take charge of the defense of southern Anhui. It is said that because Ye needs to attend the Wuhu citizens' welcome meeting on the 16th, there is talk of returning to Beijing on the morning of the 17th. (15th)</p>

<p>Jin Handing's Troops Strictly Defend Against Zhu Mao on the Fujian-Jiangxi Border</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: For this large-scale bandit suppression in Jiangxi, all of the 18th Division originally stationed in Jiangxi, the newly arrived Gong Bingfan Division, Tang Yunshan and Deng Ying's two brigades, and Chen Lei's independent regiment are under the control and command of Chairman Lu. A few days ago, Chairman Lu and Division Commander Zhang both intended to personally set out to command in order to boost morale. However, Lu stopped because no one could preside over the provincial government affairs. Division Commander Zhang also did not go to Ji'an because he had to attend the National Military Conference. However, after Chairman Lu issued the general offensive order on the 10th, the four brigades of Cheng (Guangyao), Zhu (Yaohua), Zhang and Tang all mobilized to encircle and attack Zhu Mao. Yesterday, the headquarters of the 18th Division received a telegram from Brigade Commander Zhu from Fuzhou, stating that (Zhu's bandits ordered their pseudo-column of 400 to 500 people to invade Lean on the 25th of last month, carrying out extensive burning and looting. Now, Yi's regiment defeated the bandits on the 10th of this month, recovered the county seat, and continued to pursue Yongfeng in the hope of joining forces with the Cheng and Tang brigades). As for Jin Handing, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the three provinces, after receiving the central government's order to jointly suppress Zhu Mao, he advanced from Fujian towards northern Fujian. Now, the 35th Brigade of the division has already formed guerrillas, with Zhou Tiren of the 69th Regiment as the first detachment, and Xiao Xixian of the 70th Regiment as the second detachment, advancing towards the Mao bandits in Ningdu and Xingguo. At the same time, Jin himself led a portion of the 34th and 36th Brigades, starting from Shicheng and arriving at Gucheng and Baishuizhai areas between Ruijin and Shicheng, deploying defenses on the Fujian-Jiangxi border, for fear that when the Jiangxi army launches a large-scale suppression, Zhu Mao would again resort to their previous strategy of avoiding the strong and attacking the weak, and flee to western Fujian from Ningdu and Ruijin in a roundabout way.

<h3 id="e76">Gui Zhenyuan Brigade Stationed in Quanzhou <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Last year, the 56th Division of Liu Heding was ordered by the central government to move from Anhui Province to Longyan in the Zhangzhou area of western Fujian. At that time, only the 166th Brigade of Chen Wantai and the 167th Brigade of Liu Shangzhi set out for Zhangzhou. Liu was appointed by the provincial government as the Bandit Suppression Commander of Fujian Province. The 168th Brigade of Gui Zhenyuan remained to defend the southern section of the Jinpu Railway and did not come to Fujian. Recently, due to the political change in Fujian Province, all of Liu's brigade and Jiang Yan's regiment of the 56th Division in western Fujian were ordered to concentrate in Zhangzhou awaiting orders. Gui's brigade has also recently received orders from the central government to enter Fujian and take over the defense of Quanzhou. Gui's brigade's 335th Regiment, under Zha Yongjun, with two battalions of infantry, one company of cavalry, and the brigade headquarters' rear units, engineer battalion, special service battalion, signal corps, etc., took the Fulong and Xingshi steamers, boarded the ships at Pukou on the 7th, set anchor on the morning of the 8th, and arrived in Xiamen at noon on the 11th. It was arranged that the Xingshi would carry 1,100 people and 100 war horses, and the Fulong would carry 1,100 people. The 56th Division sent the chief of the staff office and adjutant to Xiamen to take care of them. The Maritime Public Security Bureau temporarily sealed eight small steamers and more than twenty large wooden boats. On the morning of the 13th, they sailed to Anhai, transferred to Quanan buses and entered Quanzhou. The division headquarters' cavalry company opened to Zhangzhou. The 336th Regiment of Tang Lin, with three battalions of infantry, and the 335th Regiment with one battalion of infantry, one battalion of artillery, and a machine gun company, set sail from Pukou on the Huaan and Tangshan steamers respectively. At noon on the 13th, they arrived in Xiamen one after another. Brigade Commander Gui Zhenyuan took the Tangshan steamer. After arriving in Xiamen, he landed and visited Lin Guogeng, the commander of the Zhangzhou and Xiamen garrison. At 5 p.m., he took a small steamer to Fugong and entered Zhangzhou to visit Division Commander Liu Heding. The soldiers are temporarily stationed on the ships, waiting for the small steamers transporting soldiers to Anhai to return to Xiamen. Today, they can transfer to Anhai and enter Quanzhou. As for the 2nd Brigade of Marines originally stationed in Quanzhou, under Lin Shouguo, it was ordered to concentrate in Quanzhou City, and on the 12th and 13th, they sealed the Xingquan buses, set off, and moved to Xianyou and Putian. It was decided that after Gui's brigade entered Quanzhou on the 13th, they would all withdraw. Lin Shouguo had already brought his family to Xiamen on the 12th. According to Regiment Commander Zha Yongjun of Gui's brigade, he told reporters that the brigade was ordered by the central government to be stationed in Quanzhou this time and had no other mission. The central government has a solution for the Fujian affairs and it is hoped that they will be resolved peacefully. The names of the officers of Gui's brigade are investigated as follows: Brigade Commander Gui Zhenyuan, Deputy Brigade Commander Jiang Hong, Chief of Staff Gan Jilin, Adjutant-General Zhao Hanrun, 335th Regiment Commander Zha Yongjun, Deputy Regiment Commander Fang Yebiao, 1st Battalion Commander Sun Fenggang, 2nd Battalion Commander Tian Yu璠, 3rd Battalion Commander Wang Tinghao, 336th Regiment Commander Tang Lin, Deputy Regiment Commander Li Mufei, Regiment Deputy Wang Yue, 1st Battalion Commander Zhang Hongxuan, 2nd Battalion Commander Chu Junlie, 3rd Battalion Commander Ye Qin, Division Headquarters Cavalry Company Commander Wang Xianzhen. It is found that the brigade has 5,000 infantrymen, together with mortar squads, cavalry company, signal corps, rear guard medical officers, etc., totaling more than 6,000 men. (February 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Labor and Fishing Unrest in Qingdao <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since the resolution of the yarn industry labor unrest in this city, the workers of various industries have mostly returned to work as usual. The sound of labor unrest has long been absent from our ears. As for the fishing unrest, it gradually calmed down after the destruction of the Fishing Navigation Bureau last year. Unexpectedly, in recent days, labor and fishing unrest have risen again one after another. The situation is described separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Labor unrest: Before the lunar New Year, a disturbance occurred in the Fengcun oil workshop, which was quickly resolved through mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. However, the four match factories of North China, Hualu, Minghua, and Ludong have not yet resumed work since the New Year holiday. The reason is due to conflicts between labor and management regarding workers' treatment and the labor union. The factories unilaterally stopped work. The three organizations of the Municipal Party Department, the Labor Rectification Association, and the Social Affairs Bureau believed that a prolonged work stoppage would not be a satisfactory resolution. On the afternoon of the 13th, representatives of both labor and management were summoned to the auditorium of the Municipal Party Department for mediation. The labor side put forward two demands: (1) work should resume immediately, and (2) the factory should bear the office expenses of the labor union. The management completely accepted these demands. At the same time, the management also put forward three conditions: (1) to dismiss riotous workers, (2) the factory must have the right to select workers, and (3) to reorganize the Match Industry Rectification Association. The labor side considered the conditions too harsh, and the Rectification Association also believed that there was no need to reorganize the Match Industry Rectification Association. Therefore, the mediation was ineffective and the opinions of both sides became increasingly divergent. Mediation continued on the 14th, but without result. Fortunately, both labor and management sides in this labor unrest are Chinese, unlike the yarn industry labor unrest, where the management belongs to the Japanese, which immediately involves diplomacy. It should not be difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>(2) Fishing unrest: Fishermen in the Yin Island area had a conflict with the salt police last year. Now they have gathered a large number of fishermen to resist the salt tax. Many salt farmers in the area have also joined. Now, the fishermen have established a fishing industry association, electing Che Zhongrun as the chairman and Sun Bingzhang as the vice chairman. The municipal government, upon receiving the report, believed that the fishermen often gathered to cause trouble and go astray, and has ordered the Public Security Bureau to order its dissolution.

<h3 id="e78">North China to Hold Water Conservancy Discussion Conference <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to Open on April 1st for One Week</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The North China Water Conservancy Commission, whose jurisdiction reaches several provinces in North China, is responsible for matters such as river management, water conservancy, and disaster prevention. However, the vastness of the land often makes it difficult to implement plans. During the sixth general meeting in October of last year, it was decided to convene a North China Water Conservancy Discussion Conference in April of this year to discuss water conservancy construction issues in various parts of North China, and to formulate procedures for various water conservancy facilities that should be implemented. The conference will also exchange the latest theories and experiences on water conservancy projects, bringing experts together to facilitate water conservancy construction. Since the approval of this case, the Water Conservancy Commission has been preparing for the progress of the discussion conference. Recently, the general plan has been finalized and submitted to the Construction Committee for approval and record. It is reported that the scope of discussion is quite broad. All construction departments and responsible officials and senior technicians of river management agencies in Henan, Hebei, the three northeastern provinces, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Shanxi provinces are invited. For the sake of collective wisdom, representatives from the Yangtze River and Huai River Water Conservancy Commissions are also invited to participate. All those who have handled water conservancy construction in North China and have achieved results, or who have works and inventions in water conservancy academics, regardless of whether they have a position or not, are also solicited and invited. Letters are also sent to various water conservancy agencies and factories at home and abroad, asking them to send plans, charts, statistical reports, water conservancy books, engineering instruments, engineering machinery, and other water conservancy materials that can be used for observation to the commission as much as possible, taking the opportunity to open a water conservancy exhibition, publicly exhibit them, in order to popularize water conservancy knowledge. The officers of the discussion conference have now been determined, with Zhang Jingjiang as the chairman, honorary chairmen Li Shizeng, Xu Yongchang, and Cui Tingxian, and vice chairman Zeng Yangfu.

<h3 id="e79">All Circles in Northeast Celebrate Panchen Lama's Birthday <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Panchen Lama, not tolerated by the Mongolian party, came to Shenyang to reside, and has been there for several months. The 10th (the twelfth day of the first month of the lunar calendar) was his 50th birthday. All circles in Liaoning and Ningxia specially organized a Public Birthday Celebration Committee and held a public celebration ceremony at the Provincial Education Association (the old site of the Imperial Palace) on the 11th. On that day, the authorities, in order to show their congratulations to all merchants and citizens, specially informed all shops to hang flags for one day. The entrance of the Education Association was decorated with a yellow cloth and colored arch. From 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., the highest authorities in the Northeast, such as the Political Affairs Committee, the Border Defense Command, the Provincial Government, and senior and mid-level dignitaries from military, political, academic circles, all gathered at the association. At 10:45 a.m., the Panchen Lama, accompanied by translator Zhang Yuliang, secretary Liu Rongguang, master of ceremonies Xia Sangdeng, and various princes and followers, traveled in six cars from the Imperial Temple. At that time, Yang Zhengzhi (deputy officer of the Border Department), Zimingzhen (head of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau), Wang Jiarui (county magistrate of Shenyang), Wang Huayi (chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Education Association) and a group of dozens of people greeted him at the front gate. At 1 p.m., the Panchen Lama took a specially prepared yellow car, with the Kuomintang emblem painted on the front of the car. Amidst the melodious military music, he alighted from the car and was led by the welcomers to the Education Association Tongzhi Hall, and then turned to Baoke Palace to rest. The Panchen Lama wore a scattered flower yellow satin robe, purplish-brown patterned satin pants, a sable hat, and yellow leather boots. He then went to the Diguang Hall to hold the public celebration ceremony. In the auditorium, there was a seat for the Buddha, a yellow carpet on the ground, and satin chair covers embroidered with colorful longevity characters. On both sides hung satin couplets saying, "Fame, profit, great joy; fortune, longevity, much virtue." In the middle hung a plaque presented by Zhang Xueliang, inscribed with the four characters "Eternal Abode of the Dharmakaya," the upper inscription being "Grand Celebration of the Birthday of the Panchen Lama National Teacher" and the lower inscription "So-and-so Celebration." After the ceremony, he took a photo in front of the Wensu Pavilion. After the photo was taken, the Panchen Lama gave a speech, which was translated into Chinese, roughly saying that since the Panchen Lama came to China from Tibet in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, although he had a motherland to return to, he still had no fixed residence. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the late Great Marshal benefited the distant people, maintained Buddhism, and ordered him to come east, caring for him in every way, so that he had something to rely on. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, Commander-in-Chief Zhang Hanqing cared even more for the Panchen Lama, and the monks and Tibetans who followed the Panchen Lama, the military, political, and civilian officials of the four northeastern provinces. At a time when the finances of Liaoning Province were stretched, they arranged monthly allowances to help the distressed. The Panchen Lama was deeply grateful. Today, on the Panchen Lama's birthday, Commander-in-Chief Zhang, the Provincial Government Chairman Zang, and all civil and military officials, legal entities, and gentlemen, disregarding the Spring Festival celebrations and busy political affairs, showed sincerity and love, gathered to celebrate, and in addition to accepting this honor, he was endlessly grateful. Although the Panchen Lama is the leader of the Yellow Sect, he is only passing on the mantle of the Buddha, and has not left his physical body. Since he came to Liaoning, he has experienced four years of assistance from the officials and people of the four northeastern provinces. The officials and people of the four northeastern provinces have become even more fond of the Panchen Lama. What virtue and ability does the Panchen Lama have to inspire such a response? This is all due to Commander-in-Chief Zhang's enthusiasm for national affairs, concern for Tibetan soil, love for distant people, and support for the true religion, which has led to this. In the future, the Panchen Lama should pray to the Buddha even more, advocate peace, and offer his humble opinion. He respectfully wishes Commander-in-Chief Zhang ten thousand years, the Provincial Chairman ten thousand years, the officials and people of the four provinces ten thousand years, and the Republic of China ten thousand years. After the speech, the Chairman of Rehe Province, Tang Yulin, the Chairman of Liaoning Province, Zang Shiyi, and the Vice Chairman of the Northeast Political Affairs Council, Yuan Jinkai, and the Director of the Liaoning Civil Affairs Department, Chen Wenxue, accompanied the Panchen Lama to the Jiayin Hall to watch a play. At about 3 p.m., a banquet was held for the Panchen Lama at the Baoke Palace. After the banquet, Tang, Zang, and Yuan bid farewell one after another. Chen accompanied the Panchen Lama back to the Jiayin Hall to watch a play. The plays included "Great Blessing," "Boundless Longevity," "Prosperous Spring and Autumn," "Qingdingzhu," and "Meeting of Heroes." At 4:20 p.m., the guests sent the Panchen Lama off the stage, and the director of the Panchen Lama Reception Office, Li Shaobai, personally escorted the Panchen Lama to his residence. At about 6 p.m., the guests dispersed. This afternoon at 3 p.m., the Panchen Lama will host a banquet for all circles at the Education Association. (February 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Ardent Anti-Japanese Movement of Koreans <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Korean Students in Longjing Village Hold Demonstration</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Korean anti-Japanese movement has been extremely vigorous and passionate. There is no doubt about it in the major cities of Korea. Even in Longjing Village, a demonstration was held on the 5th of this month. Although the Japanese police forcibly suppressed it and treated them in every way, the patriotic spirit of the Korean youth was not slightly subdued. The following is the situation described by witnesses in the area:</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of student unrest in Korea, the Japanese police have been under special martial law. They frequently searched Korean hotels and private schools. In recent days, more than 250 Koreans have been detained by the Japanese police at the consulate, mostly students, but there is no concrete evidence of their crimes. At noon on the 5th, more than 100 Japanese consulate police officers, all fully armed, either on horseback or on foot, went in groups of three or five to Korean student dormitories and the Dacheng Middle School to conduct searches, and forced the students to go to the consulate. The students had no weapons and were unable to resist, so they obeyed. Unexpectedly, in front of the consulate, a Japanese policeman pushed a Korean student down and kicked his head with force, causing him to bleed profusely and faint immediately. When the Japanese police saw that he was about to die, they carried him into the prison. The rest were also forced into the prison. When the students were forced to go to the consulate, they were in excellent spirits and kept shouting "Korean Independence Forever."</p>
<p>At about 1 p.m. on the 5th, Korean students in Longjing Village held a demonstration. The Japanese police surrounded and arrested them, arresting a total of 57 students. When they rushed into the consulate, there were four Korean women, some carrying children on their backs, behind the students, also shouting "Korea Forever," and were arrested by the Japanese police and taken to the consulate.</p>
<p>At about 2 p.m. on the 5th, on the main street near the Japanese consulate, a Japanese policeman, riding a tall horse with a rope tied to it, tied a Korean student (about seventeen or eighteen years old) by two of his fingers and galloped along the street. The student had no choice but to run after him. However, how could a person's running speed catch up with a galloping horse? The two thumbs were tightly bound by the rope, and the pain was indescribable. Yet he still shouted "Long Live."</p>
<p>At about 4 p.m. on the 5th, more than a dozen Japanese policemen patrolled on horseback, galloping through the streets. All Korean private schools were searched. Later, behind the Dongshan Entu School, eight youths were arrested, including one woman. In front of the Korean bank, a student from the Dongxing School was arrested and taken to the Japanese Consulate General for detention. (February 12th)</p>

<p>The County Government Summons Local Chiefs to Instruct Them. In this county, the harvest of grain rentals in the southern townships last winter was only 30-40%, which affected the national tax revenue and caused a sharp reduction. The grain transport was originally based on past precedents, with the lunar New Year's Eve as the initial deadline. However, most of it was not moved last year. The county government and the Finance Bureau jointly presented a request to the Finance Department to extend the deadline by half a month and strictly urge rent collection. The county government specially summoned the local chiefs of each district on the 17th to listen to the instructions. The general instructions were that the grain transport has been approved for an extension of half a month, with the deadline being the 20th. All industries should be notified to pay within the deadline. The public silver from last year should be closed out at the end of this month, and all chiefs should be ordered to pay the full amount, without any shortage. All tenants should be notified to quickly return the rent to avoid being pursued for payment.</p>

<p>Han Jin's Steaming Bone Examination. The case of Jin, the daughter-in-law of the late Qing official Han Qipangzi, who resided at No. 30 Gejia Lane, Changmen Nei, who died under unclear circumstances, has been lingering for more than a year. Now, her relatives Han Guoduo and Han Guolin have come forward to report it, accusing the悍servant Shi Junqing and others of murdering her. After accepting the case, the Wuxian District Court detained Shi Junqing and Li Chenshi. Yesterday (the 17th) morning, at the temple east of the Jiezhuang Temple in Xiyuan outside Changmen, Han Jin's body was exhumed and steamed bones were examined. A shed was pre-built for steaming the bones. The inspection officers of Zhenjiang and Wujiang counties were invited to Suzhou to assist. The president of Boxi Hospital, Li Guangxun, and others were invited to help with the examination. On that day, Inspector Lai led the police to preside over the inspection. At 2 p.m., Han Jin's coffin was carried to the corpse field. First, the deceased's husband Han Youjiu and the plaintiff Han Guoduo and others made a written statement before the coffin was opened, and then the coffin was opened, the corpse was taken out, the clothes were cut off, and the whole body was washed. Because the corpse had not completely rotted, it could still be examined. Silver needles were then inserted into the mouth and anus, and taken out after about ten minutes, and no traces of poison were found. The whole body was then covered with distiller's grains, and silver needles were still inserted into the mouth and anus. Cotton was then used to cover the body for testing. The examination was completed at 6 p.m., but no traces of injury were found. It was then wrapped in cotton wool and placed back in the original coffin, which was then sealed. It has not yet been decided whether to use steamed bones for the examination today (the 18th).</p>

<p>Result: 40 to 26</p>
<p>There Were Also Three Group B Matches</p>
<p>Yesterday's match between Qing Guang and West Qing concerned the future of this year's Shanghai Basketball Association Group A Championship. If Qing Guang were to win, the championship would also belong to them. As a result of the competition, Qing Guang suffered a major blow and returned in defeat. West Qing is therefore closer to the championship. West Qing's victory was due to the equal strength of its internal and external players, coupled with accurate shooting and tall, fast-moving players. As a result, Qing Guang was controlled by them and allowed them to invade. Although there were famous generals who rose up to resist, most of their companions did not fulfill their duties. A single tree cannot support a collapsing building. The Qing Guang team lost to West Qing with a score of 26 to 40. Not long after the start of the battle, West Qing's Smith missed a free throw. Sullivan seized the opportunity and threw the ball with both hands, scoring a goal. Smith added two more points, making it 4-0 in the lead. At that time, Qing Guang launched a major counterattack, Tan roamed freely under the West Qing basket, throwing repeatedly, but none hit the mark. The ball then turned back. Before you knew it, West Qing added two more balls. Qing Guang's Li Baojun took advantage of the unpreparedness of others and went deep alone, causing the enemy to be at a loss and breaking the line. He jumped and threw to win the ball. West Qing's cavalry emerged one after another, and the momentum was smooth. Before long, they led 12-2. Qing Guang fought again. Tan single-handedly scored five points, while West Qing's Hennis and others also gained something. The score at halftime was West Qing 17, Qing Guang 7. After switching sides and fighting again, one of Tan's shots circled the iron ring several times and still jumped out. At this point, if there were celestial numbers, Li Sunneiwei successively added three points, and the momentum gradually grew stronger. However, West Qing's center Hennis stood tall and straight, dribbling the ball in the center, and doing whatever he wanted, causing Qing Guang to suffer a great loss. The shooting skills of their five players were indeed remarkable, so they ultimately won 40-26. From now on, West Qing's only strong opponent will be East-West. If East-West can defeat West Qing, then East-West and Qing Guang, West Qing will be divided into three parts, and who will win the championship, or another struggle will be needed.

<p>Yesterday's Shih Shih Football Championship</p>
<p>First Cycle: Each of the Three Newspapers Wins Once</p>
<p>The Championship Depends on Another Effort</p>
<p>The football championship held by the Newspaper Industry Union is divided into three teams, namely *Xin Wen Bao*, *Shen Bao*, and *Shih Shih Hsin Bao*. A double round-robin system is adopted. The first cycle has now ended. In the first match, *Shen Bao* won against *Shih Shih*; in the second match, *Xin Wen* won against *Shen Bao*; and in the third match, *Shih Shih* won against *Xin Wen*. Each team scored two points. The players of each team were originally familiar old friends and showed a kind and amiable attitude, which is commendable. The performance was also quite good. The strength of the three teams is also very similar. Each time they took the field, they were able to kick hard and never give up. The second cycle will begin this Thursday. It is unknown who will win the championship.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the day for the match between *Shih Shih Hsin Bao* and *Xin Wen Bao*. At ten o'clock, the athletes of both sides began to fight. After about ten minutes, Zhang Baokang, the center forward of the *Shih Shih* team, received a pass from the right wing and shot from 30 yards, scoring a goal. Afterwards, both sides fought even harder, and the lines also changed each other. However, due to the lack of practice, although there were many opportunities, none hit the mark. In the first half, it was 1 to 0. In the second half, there was no score. As a result, the victory belonged to the *Shih Shih* team. Referee Zhang Wugao.</p>

<h3 id="e114">My Recollections on This Divisional Tournament (Part 2) by Li Huitang <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the referees this time: The referees have been mentioned. People are probably wondering if I must have failed and am blaming others. In fact, after the game, the word "referee" should not be mentioned again. However, the referees this time have had a huge impact on us, so I have to take this opportunity to make public to the country all kinds of things about the referees this time.</p>
<p>Before talking about other things, I want to declare first that I dare not say that our failure this time was the fault of the referees, and I did not say that they were biased. I remember that someone in the press once comforted me very warmly, saying that if the referee for your game this time was a foreigner or someone who was a little more fair, you probably wouldn't have failed. I am very grateful for his sincerity in comforting me, but I do not quite agree with his argument.</p>
<p>But while I believe that he was not biased, I do have a few points of dissatisfaction with him. All three of our games this time were refereed by Mr. Ye Jiugao alone. In the first game, the opponent's center-back frequently used violence against me, wanting to injure me as soon as possible. I dare to believe that his intention was no better than that of any player in the North China-East China team. His actions were more rude than anyone else's. Mr. Ye did not warn him, but often said to me, "Ignore him."</p>
<p>In the second game, the originally scheduled 90 minutes passed, and there were 12 more minutes. According to Mr. Ye, it was because the players were substituted during the game to make up for the lost time. The goal that allowed the South China team to turn defeat into a draw happened to be kicked in the last two minutes. After the draw, the game should have been extended as in the first game, but Mr. Ye said that it was too late and could not continue, so the South China team, which was running out of strength, was spared from defeat. I will not discuss whether Mr. Ye's views and reasons for overtime are appropriate or not. However, once, when our left wing was attacking fiercely with the ball, Mr. Ye suddenly blew the whistle. It turned out that a center-back in the South China team had fallen to the ground due to an injury, so he stopped the game. Mr. Ye is a referee hired by the Hong Kong Association. It is really puzzling that he stopped the game when he should not have stopped the game. If Mr. Ye thinks that the game should be stopped, then next time we encounter an enemy attack, we only need one person to fake an injury and lie on the ground to get out of trouble.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Qu's Character Indexing Method Original Author Qu Chongfu <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Since I was a child, I attended foreign language schools. After graduating from St. John's in 1923, I went to study in the United States and did not have the opportunity to get close to Chinese dictionaries, nor did I have any research on Chinese primary schools. However, I suddenly thought that I wanted to improve Chinese dictionaries, wanting to replace the methods used in China for thousands of years with my own opinions. When you think about it, isn't this (shocking)? Isn't this (unbelievable)? Although this is the case, we all know that people in the world cannot fully predict the affairs of the world. If people in the world could fully predict the affairs of the world, then the word "hope" could be removed from all dictionaries in the world. I began to study this unpopular issue because I was impressed by the convenience of the American character indexing method and the ease of studying in the United States, as well as the difficulty of Chinese character indexing in China and the inconvenience of studying in China. The reason why it is not difficult to study in the United States is because English words are arranged in order according to the 26 letters of A, B, C, D. It is inconvenient to study in China because China does not have letters and does not have a simple and easy-to-learn character indexing method.</p>
<p>The character indexing method is the foundation of cataloging (Indexscience). Most Chinese students are unwilling to study the subject of cataloging. They do not know that cataloging is the only help for reading and studying. People who understand catalogs can use the library's catalogs to find all relevant books in a library, and use the detailed contents of a book to analyze the essence of the entire book, and be able to find the most things in the shortest amount of time. Without this kind of research, even if you enter the library, you cannot find relevant books without help, and if you have a book in hand, you cannot find the words and things you are looking for without reading it for a long time. The reason why I invented the method of checking Chinese characters is because I had some research on cataloging when I was studying in the United States. I hope that after a simple method is invented, Chinese cataloging will gradually develop, national heritage can be [organized] as soon as possible, and learning methods can be convenient day by day.</p>
<p>The most popular character indexing method in China has always been the radical indexing method. Xu Shen's *Shuo Wen Jie Zi* in the early Han Dynasty and the *Kangxi Dictionary* in the early Qing Dynasty were both compiled successfully based on this method.</p>
<p>The 214 radicals in the *Kangxi Dictionary* are distributed extremely unevenly. The eleven major radicals (人) (mouth 口) (heart 心) (hand 手) (water 水) (wood 木) (gold 金) (grass 艸) (silk 糸) (insect 虫) (speech 言) account for about one-half of the characters in the entire book, while rare radicals (that is, those containing less than twenty characters), such as (人) (口) (卜) (厶), etc., all contain no more than one thousand characters in the 120 divisions and provinces.</p>
<p>The boundaries of the radicals divided in the *Kangxi Dictionary* are extremely unclear. It is clear that the characters of the first radical should belong to the second radical. I don't need to say much about it. As for the number of strokes, which strokes should be connected into one stroke and which should be divided into two strokes, there is no fixed standard. It is very difficult to guess which radical, and you have to calculate the number of strokes. You have to look for the page number of the radical in more than ten or twenty radicals with the same number of strokes, and when you turn to the page number, you have to calculate the number of strokes again. In the same radical and the same number of strokes, among dozens or hundreds of characters (Wang Yunwu said that there are 205 characters with eight strokes in the grass radical and 204 characters with nine strokes in the grass radical), pay attention to each one and search. If you still can't find it, you have to spend twice the effort and wait in one more stroke or one less stroke. If you still can't find it, you have to spend a lot of effort to calculate the total number of strokes of the entire character and look for it among hundreds of characters in the character indexing table (the characters contained in the character indexing table with seven to twelve strokes are all above 200 or 300). In this way, to find the meaning of a small character, you must spend two or three times the effort, go through a long time, count dozens to hundreds of irrelevant characters, and then luckily find the character you are looking for. Do you think it's troublesome? (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e117">Zhulian Waterfall in Changxing <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Jin</p>
<p>The Zhulian Waterfall on Biyan Mountain in Changxing is a famous scenic spot. In the past, when Su Dongpo was the prefect of Wuxing, he would occasionally lead his colleagues to visit. His inscription said, "The Zhulian wants to roll up the rain in the West Mountain, all pouring down towards the Milky Way." This is a factual record. It is a pity that the place is located in a remote rural area and lacks people to care for it, so that the natural beauty has long been submerged in the wilderness. I don't know how many years have passed before it has this fleeting moment of glory today. What are the feelings about this? The following is a brief record of what I learned from a friend's communication.</p>
<p>Changxing is located in a remote mountainous area. There are twelve peaks of Bian, stretching endlessly. Biyan is the highest and largest. The stone walls are thousands of feet high and stand tall in the clouds. The Zhulian water meanders through it. When it reaches the gap, it flows straight down, the momentum is very rapid, and it suddenly becomes a waterfall. It is about thirty feet high. From a distance, it looks like a long white silk hanging from the sky. The sound of gurgling does not stop day and night. The local people often use it to irrigate their fields. Below it is the She Shen Tan. The pool is not wide and flows tortuously to the northeast, passing through Da Dang Yang and entering Taihu Lake. Taihu Lake is a huge pool where all the rivers in western Zhejiang converge. According to research, the distant source of Zhulian water originates from Tianji Ridge on Biyan Mountain, about three miles away. Whenever the Yellow Plum water rises, the momentum becomes more surging. If it cannot be discharged in time, it will spray out from the [missing character] border, and the pearls and jade will splash, making it even more spectacular. The most peculiar thing is that when there is no rain for a long time and it becomes a drought, this water will never run dry due to the exhaustion of the flow. Some say that the Tianji spring source is connected to Tianmu, which is credible. It is now heard that the Bianxiang district committee of this county has been ordered to investigate and is urgently constructing it. If it can be renewed and expanded, then the scenery of western Zhejiang will definitely add a lot of color to the lakes and mountains.</p>
<h3 id="e118">News from the Bandit Suppression in Northern Jiangsu <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>The area around Tongzhou and Rugao in northern Jiangsu has always been known for its peace. However, in recent years, banditry has become rampant, causing unrest among the local people. What follows is a description of what I have heard and seen, written for this publication.</p>
<p>Self-Defense Eradicates Bandits: In a certain town in the eastern part of Tongzhou, there was a clan of the surname "Mou" living together. All the clan members were wealthy, with some possessing tens of thousands of gold and others up to hundreds of thousands. Recognizing the ferocity of the bandits and their repeated covetousness, they joined forces to devise a plan to defend against them. On one hand, they built defensive fortifications, and on the other hand, they procured firearms, amassing considerable strength, including handheld machine guns and searchlights. One night, a patrolman used a searchlight on a lookout tower and saw dark shadows looming several miles away, like a swarm of ants, rushing towards them with great force. He fired a volley of shots into the sky, but the rushing continued unabated. He then fired into the crowd, but still to no avail, and they drew closer and closer. When they were not far from the houses, he fired the machine gun, and the bandits finally retreated. Upon inspecting the scene, he found more than ninety people shot down, mostly tenant farmers and neighbors, holding farming tools in their hands. When asked, those who were not dead claimed that they had been coerced by the communists and would be shot if they disobeyed. The bandits were at the rear, and anyone who retreated would be killed. Therefore, these people advanced to their deaths, and retreating meant death as well, leaving them with no other choice.</p>
<p>Failed Joint Suppression: The town of Taoxiang in Rugao, bordering Tongzhou, was a den of communist bandits. After the area was captured by the bandits, government troops did not arrive for several months, allowing the bandits to occupy it. The administrative and public security bureaus were all destroyed, and the problem grew, becoming a major threat to the Pingchao area of Tongzhou. Chen Buchan, the magistrate of Nantong County, known for his bandit suppression efforts, seeing the plight of the people, invited the magistrate of Rugao County to join him in suppressing the bandits. At midnight on the appointed day, the troops of Tongzhou were mobilized and launched a courageous siege. However, the magistrate of Rugao County broke his promise. Thus, they could only watch as the communist bandit leaders leisurely escaped towards the border, missing a golden opportunity.</p>
<p>It is truly regrettable, and the soldiers and police of Tongzhou were particularly indignant. If they had been defeated by the bandits, and the reinforcements from Rugao had not arrived, would it not have meant total annihilation? It is now reported that the local authorities have lodged a serious protest with the Rugao government.</p>
<p>Beheading for Public Display: After a successful bandit suppression campaign, the head of a bandit was hung up for public display to appease the people and intimidate the bandits. On the eleventh, it was brought to Pingchao Town and displayed on a stone pillar at a crossroads. A crowd immediately gathered to watch. The bandit's face was as yellow as gold paper, and he did not look particularly frightening. I sighed and said, "He was once a hero, but where is he now?" Human beings slaughter each other, and the killing intent is greatly unleashed. Although the bandit's death is deserved, the changes in the world are truly lamentable.</p>
<h3 id="e119">An On-the-Spot Examination <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Yin</p>
<p>In recent years, many divorce cases have occurred in Peixian, accompanied by various farcical events. Such a phenomenon is quite unusual for an inland area. The most notable case is that of Zhang Biyue, which caused a nationwide sensation. Biyue divorced a man surnamed Wu, and her sister divorced a man surnamed Hao, leading to the tragic shooting of Huang Changdian. The incident was even adapted into a new play in Shanghai. I believe readers may still remember it. Recently, another amusing story of an on-the-spot examination occurred, similar to the "dissecting the abdomen to verify the flower" incident. Fortunately, the county magistrate acted as a Lou Lian, using kind words to mediate, and the couple was able to reconcile. Initially, there was a man surnamed Mou who was quite unattractive. He had graduated from middle school and was therefore quite knowledgeable. He was the opposite of those who are outwardly beautiful but inwardly flawed. His wife was beautiful and intelligent, but they had been married for three years and had not yet had children. She was unhappy with her husband's unattractive appearance. Quarrels were often heard outside their home. They were husband and wife in name only, without the happiness of a couple, and she had long intended to divorce. Under the influence of the new trends, her determination grew stronger. Finally, they quarreled over an incident and went to the county government, requesting a divorce. The county magistrate summoned Mou and asked if he wanted a divorce. He said he did, but that his wife was pregnant with his child, which should be returned to him. His wife glared at him and said, "I am not pregnant. He is deliberately making things difficult." She then bared her abdomen to the county magistrate and said, "It is not difficult to know whether I am pregnant or not with a single touch." The county magistrate was very embarrassed. Mou insisted on his previous statement, saying, "The pregnancy is still in its early stages and cannot be seen from the outside. How can it be known with a single touch?" The wife became very angry and said in a stern voice, "Then please let the county magistrate dissect me to find out the truth!" As she spoke, she held up her bare abdomen, demanding an immediate dissection. At this point, the county magistrate realized that Mou still did not want to divorce, so he changed his expression and began to persuade and comfort them. His wife also realized that dissecting her abdomen to verify the pregnancy was a matter of life and death, and she became slightly discouraged. Shame and aversion also took hold of her, and she bowed her head and returned home with her husband.</p>

<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Last night, Mr. Zhao Lantang hosted a banquet at the Jue Lin Temple. Yimei also attended the grand occasion. In the midst of the bustling crowd, I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Yao Yuping, a revolutionary veteran. Mr. Yao had a thin face and a slight mustache. His hair was already gray, and he spoke gently and kindly. He is now a resident of Shanghai, living in seclusion and refusing guests, not concerning himself with the state of affairs. He is devoted to Zen meditation, sitting in silence all day, saying, "All truths can be realized through meditation. Otherwise, chanting scriptures and reciting Buddhist texts is merely a formality." These are truly wise words. The Jue Lin Temple did not have wine, but Mr. Luo Liangong cannot be happy without a cup. He specially ordered a servant to buy some. In his drunkenness, he recounted a time when he drank at someone's house, tasting forty-year-old aged wine. The taste was light, harmonious, and mellow. He unknowingly emptied his cup again and again. The host repeatedly stopped him, saying, "Aged wine should not be drunk in excess, lest you become intoxicated." At the time, I thought the host was being stingy, not allowing me to drink to my fill. But when I left, a cool breeze blew on me, and my eyes were blurred and my head was dizzy. I could hardly stand. Only then did I realize the power of aged wine. No wonder the host repeatedly stopped me. A certain gentleman at the table then mentioned that his family had lychee wine. In the past, Wang Shipeng ate lychees and wrote the line, "How dare I eat the 'Jade Hall Red'?" So he adopted the beautiful name "Jade Hall Red." In midsummer, he peels fresh lychees and puts them into sorghum wine, adding Xiangtang rock sugar, and then seals it tightly, away from the wind and sun. After ten years, it ferments and can be drunk. Its color is crimson, its taste sweet, fragrant, and rich, and it has the effect of strengthening the stomach. It is not available on the market. Mr. Qian Huahuo immediately requested a jar, hoping to share it with his friends one day, so that they could all enjoy the taste of this exquisite nectar.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Tea Addiction <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Wenzhong</p>
<p>In recent years, Shanghai literati have formed poetry societies to write and harmonize with each other. Mr. Chen Zhuzun and Mr. Liang Yantian are both members of the society. One is known for his drinking capacity, and the other for his tea addiction. Mr. Zhuzun's drinking capacity has already been recorded in this publication by Wan Chengjun. Today, I will talk about Mr. Yantian's tea addiction.</p>
<p>Mr. Yantian is an old classicist, over seventy years old, but his spirit is vigorous and he walks faster than a young man. He is extremely fond of tea. In his room, besides the zither and books, there is a tea set on his desk. When the mood strikes, he brews tea himself, holding a cup in his left hand and a brush in his right, drinking and chanting poetry all day long. He says, "Reciting poetry without drinking tea is dry and tasteless, and inspiration does not arise." His poem says: "Every time I encounter fine wine, my heart is drunk first; I love to brew new tea myself. How many days have I returned to my hometown with a cane? Joining the society with a group of virtuous people." From this, one can see a glimpse. (Thank you)</p>

<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>▲ The Death of Putaier</p>
<p>(2) Funeral</p>
<p>The next day, the weather was dark and gloomy in the morning, threatening rain. It was very depressing. Around two o'clock in the afternoon, yellow fog rose up in the sky, as if mourning the death of this great sculptor. After three o'clock, Ms. Xiao, Peng Shiqin, Chuan Lei, and Zhang Xuan gathered at my studio at 20 Rue de la Sorbonne. We then took motorcycles to Impasse du Marne. This was not only to pay our respects to the remains of this great figure, but also to see many of the master's unpublished masterpieces.</p>
<p>"Hero worship" is a common human psychology, especially my own peculiar habit. Therefore, I do not shy away from my "close contact with great figures." This time, I came to Europe to study and also wanted to pay my respects to a few heroes. The painters Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Antler Duran, and Feng Na; the poet Valery; the literary giant Romain Rolland; and the sculptor Antoine Putaier were all on my list to meet. Now, before I could meet Putaier, he suddenly died. How saddened I was.</p>
<p>As the car sped through the city streets, it was pouring rain. This made me feel even more desolate. Turning right on the main road, there was a row of short, slightly brownish-yellow walls, clinging to old vines that ran horizontally and vertically. It was truly ancient and desolate. Four police officers stood in front of the gate. Many people were coming and going. Our car also stopped. Mr. Chuan went up, took off his hat, and asked, "Is Mr. Putaier's L'atelier here?"</p>
<p>One of them, with white whiskers and a tall figure, replied, "This is it."</p>
<p>Walking into the courtyard, the large trees seemed unable to withstand the wind and frost, and yellow withered leaves fell on our heads. After walking dozens of steps further, on the left, there was a tall, black building with glass windows. It looked like it had been exposed to the wind and rain for twenty or thirty years. This was the famous Putaier's L'atelier. Looking at the long row of glass windows, I thought to myself, Putaier constantly created many immortal and magical masterpieces, probably in that room.</p>
<p>As it was raining, it was as dark as dusk. The L'atelier was lit with bright electric lights. Many people had come to participate in the funeral. We stood outside the door in the downpour. Two masters of ceremonies, dressed in black formal attire, wearing thick silver chains around their necks, with red faces full of pimples, and golden-yellow hair and beards, were very eye-catching. They respectfully asked the guests to sign their names one by one and entered the door in a solemn and reverent manner. In the center was placed Putaier's remains. Countless flowers were piled all around, especially the wreaths in the back, which were piled as high as the roof. Two three-foot-long white candles were placed on either side of the remains. The dim candlelight flickered in the wind, revealing a mournful and sorrowful color. In the corner on the left, a statue of Rodin was placed high up. To commemorate his teacher, Auguste Rodin, Putaier created this statue of the great artist. The thoughtful eyes and the vigorous and broad forehead shone with magical charm. The spirit of a deeply thoughtful and sublime artist was expressed here. It can be said to be a very bold and symbolic representation of the whole person of Rodin. It seemed as if he was right in front of you. Below it was also carved "My Teacher Rodin." On the left was a twenty-foot-high and eight-foot-wide relief sculpture, an unfinished large-scale concept. The large work in front was a completely gigantic illusion. The left hand was stretched straight out, and the muscles of the whole body were tense like a lion roaring. It had the face of a Babylonian or Assyrian grotesque giant statue. It was truly a bold attempt. There were also many of his recent works all around. Because it was a solemn funeral, we could not look at each one in detail. Mrs. Putaier and other relatives were all wearing black mourning clothes, sitting on one side of the remains. Most of the guests stood solemnly around, taking turns to pay their respects and瞻仰遺容. I also ran forward to瞻仰瞻仰. His face looked like a triangle at first glance. The top of his head was completely bald. His forehead was broad and protruding. On both sides of his temples, there were patches of white hair that connected to the beard on his chin. His cheekbones were very wide. His eyes were deep and sunken, as if he were asleep. His mouth was tightly closed. Although he was dead, his face still showed a clear, deep, and radiant demeanor.</p>
<p>Before long, more and more mourners gathered. An old man in his eighties came in and burst into tears. He said that he had received a letter from him ten days ago. He learned of the sad news yesterday morning and came to Paris specially. Now he was saying goodbye to him forever. Many people comforted him and helped him to sit with Mrs. Putaier. He was still crying uncontrollably. The room was silent and even more solemn and desolate.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, we stood there for an hour and did not want to leave the L'atelier. Later, there were too many people, and we could not stay any longer. I looked back again and again and left the room.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Gold Market is Greatly Weakened After the Swap <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The initial peak continued to decline, with the price slightly weakening by 0.25 taels. Yesterday, the gold market was again in a weak state. However, the initial peak occurred in the afternoon, with the morning market estimated at 7 taels difference. The afternoon market was also estimated to fluctuate around 3 taels and several qian. The market atmosphere was chaotic. Some dealers were quick to buy and sell, but supply and demand differed. Yuan Sheng, Sheng Da, Yuan Mao Yong, Da De Cheng, Shun Li, and others bought in, while some major players shorted and sold off positions, such as Yong Heng, Yu Da, Zhi Feng Yong, and Tai Xing. As for the exchange rate, it had already been reduced by one level, but the internal trend was weakening rather than strengthening. Some dealers were selling. The early market was strong, and the price once rose to over 493 taels. Later, major players sold off, and the exchange rate also turned to a deficit trend, resulting in a continuous decline of as much as 5 taels. In the initial stages of the afternoon market, it was still stable. Later, Japanese banks and speculators sold off in droves, and foreign exchange deteriorated, with each pound sterling worth 2 shillings. It fell by more than 3 taels and broke through 85 taels. Later, various parties made some purchases, and the situation eased, rebounding by 1-2 taels, but there were ups and downs from time to time, while foreign exchange was flat. Transactions were smooth. The final price was 86 taels and zero qian, a decrease of 3 taels and 9 qian from the previous day's closing price. In general, the investors were in a chaotic mood, and the price fluctuated in a narrow range. Yesterday was the beginning of the week, and there was no telegraphic news from the major regulations.</p>
<p>In the early morning, major players bought heavily and opened at a high price. The opening price for the April gold standard was 491 taels and 2 qian, an increase of 1 tael. Later, it rose to 93 taels and 4 qian, probably because major players were buying heavily. The exchange rate was also strong. The Japanese gold price was 1 tael and 0.025 by Sumitomo. The British gold price was 11 pence and 6875 by the British and Indian merchants. However, the gross price fell back by more than 2 taels due to the major players selling off. Therefore, when the ordinance was announced, it was 91 taels. Subsequently, there were slight increases and decreases. Upon learning that the ordinance was reduced by 25, the US dollar was reduced by 5 jiao, and the Japanese gold price increased by 1 fen and 125, it rose to 91 taels, 5-6 qian. The internal price was flat. The banks were quoting 11 pence and 75 for British gold in April and May, and US dollar for Huawei Japan etc. were doing 48 yuan and 125. After 10 o'clock, the market suddenly weakened. Yong Heng, Yu Da, etc., were selling first, and the price broke into below 90 taels. The Meifeng and Datong had done US dollar in April and May for 11 pence 8125, and the Megali sold 11 pence and 9375. The investors were very frustrated, and the price fell sharply, only to be estimated at 86 taels, 3-4 qian by 11:45. It jumped by 8-9 qian, because Zero households and others made purchases, and after it closed at 87 taels.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the trough at 2:30 pm was 84 taels and 8 qian. The opening price at closing was 88 taels and 3 qian. It was then increased from 87 qian and 3 qian to 8 taels and 4 qian. This was really because the demand and supply were in progress at times, and because Mitsui and others tended to sell, the market atmosphere was not good, and it had already fallen by more than 3 taels. The exchange rate was also wide. Megali quoted British gold for 2 shillings, and Shanghai quoted Japanese gold for 1 tael and 0.0125. It fell to 84 taels and 8 qian by 2:30. Since then, the Guangdong business association and others bought in, and it jumped by 2 taels. Also, because dealers sold to banks for cash estimated at 85 taels, the investors were prone to become bullish. At 3 o'clock, it was 86 taels and 8 qian. After this, there was an increase and decrease of 1-2 taels, and the buyers on the counter were more numerous after 4 o'clock, so the price went up, estimated at 2 taels, 86 taels, 8-9 qian. However, the foreign exchange transactions were limited, and the closing price at 4:30 pm was 86 taels and 3 qian, a decrease of 3 taels and 9 qian compared to the 16th.</p>
<p>The difference for the whole day was 8 taels and 6 qian. It was noted that the maximum for one day was 93 taels and 4 qian, the minimum was 84 taels and 8 qian, a difference of 8 taels and 6 qian. The quoted price was changed to 499 taels and 2 qian, because the Japanese gold price was quoted 1 fen and 125 higher. The initial trade was small, 17-18 taels, but the afternoon repressed small was 12-13 taels. The account was posted for 87 taels to 86 taels, and the water was replenished for 87 taels. The afternoon replenished water for 87 taels. The physical goods opened at 91 taels and 3 qian in the early morning, closed at 87 taels and a half in the afternoon, 88 taels in the afternoon, and 86 taels and a half at closing.

In the afternoon, dealers such as Zhi Feng Yong, Yu Da, Tai Xing, Yong Heng, and Yuan Cheng Yong all sold in.

<h3 id="e129">Yarn and Cotton Demand Unenthusiastic, Yarn Market Flat and Weary <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is flat and weary, because the overseas yarn market is trending downward again, and actual</p>
<p>sales have not been stimulated. The inventory is not easily eliminated in a short time, and people's confidence is relatively weak. The prosperity or decline of current actual sales directly dominates the advance and retreat of the yarn market. The spring sales season is approaching, but customer groups do not seem very enthusiastic. Although there are daily transactions of one or two thousand bales, the public believes that this sales volume is considered smooth in the off-season, but it is not considered satisfactory during this period. Further analysis of the yarn inventory shows that the number of coarse yarns exceeds that of fine count yarns, which is why people's confidence cannot be aroused for the time being. According to inquiries, customer groups have the following concerns: First, the agricultural situation in the interior is not ideal, and purchasing power is weak. Second, changes in current events and bandit disasters cause frequent traffic disruptions. Therefore, the intention to purchase is not strong. However, in the futures yarn market, the buyers are all large households, while the sellers are all retail investors. Therefore, although people's confidence is weak, the market presents a situation of hesitation. What the future holds depends solely on actual sales.</p>
<p>Futures yarn fell seven qian. People in the exchange mark standard yarn. The morning market was initially quite firm, but then actual sales were sluggish, the third grade trended downward, and the market turned weary. Each month rose and fell by two, three, or four qian. In the afternoon, the third grade reported a decline, people's confidence was weaker, and the market continued to be weary. Each month fell by three qian to seven qian. The total transaction volume was 14,300 bales. The closing price of the standard yarn is recorded below:</p>
<p>Standard Closing Price Rise/Fall　May 1554　Down 7</p>
<p>February　576　Down 7　June 1554　5</p>
<p>March　1565　3　July 1556　4</p>
<p>April　557　4</p>
<p>Spot sales were 2,000 bales. Spot yarn transactions in the market were still good, totaling 2,000 bales, with the market being weary by about two qian and five fen. Among the customer groups, Sichuan imported 705 bales, Jiangxi 295 bales, the interior 195 bales</p>
<p>, Tianjin 243 bales, Xuzhou 165 bales, Guangdong 65 bales, Anqing 20 bales, Hankou 25 bales, Shantou 50 bales, Xiamen 35 bales, Niuzhuang 30 bales, Yanhua 7 bales, Ningbo 10 bales, Qinhuangdao 10 bales, Dalian, Qingdao, and Yantai each imported 5 bales. In addition, fellow traders imported 20 bales, Dongmian Foreign Firm 100 bales, and factory openings 60 bales. The selling prices of each yarn can be found in the price list below.</p>

<p>Survey at the End of January</p>
<p>Recently, the yarn market has gradually moved from a weak position to a stable one. The future trends will fluctuate with overseas news, but the direct driving force will depend on current affairs news and the prosperity or decline of actual sales. However, the increase or decrease in inventory numbers also has a significant impact on the advance and retreat of the market. According to a survey, at the end of January this year, the local yarn inventory reached 111,617 bales, an increase of 40,997 bales compared to the end of December last year. If this large number cannot be eliminated, it will be enough to hinder the development of the yarn market. The inventory numbers of each count are listed separately below:</p>

<p>The cotton market situation is stable because American and Indian cotton continue to trend upward. Therefore, although those who need cotton do not have significant activity, people's confidence is slightly stable, and the calm attitude of those holding goods is also an indication of market stability. However, according to Indian news, each yarn factory has a relatively abundant inventory of piece goods and has decided to stop work one day more per week starting March 15. Therefore, the consumption of Indian cotton will inevitably decrease, and the market price may change. The extent of its impact is also something we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Marked cotton is stable following foreign cotton. The Exchange's Hankou Marked Cotton was firm in the morning due to the consistent strength of the American and Indian cotton markets from the previous day, and people's confidence was quite good. Each month rose five fen to two qian and five fen. In the afternoon, due to the weakening of the yarn market, the market turned weary again, falling back five fen. The total transaction volume was 31,600 dan. The closing prices of Hankou Marked Cotton are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hankou Mark Closing Price Rise/Fall　Inventory Account　Closing Price Rise/Fall　Inventory Account</p>
<p>2　3515 Up 5　41,800　5 3480 Up 25　65,100</p>

<p>4　3,75　20　6800　7 3490　20　27,800</p>
<p>Spot cotton transactions remain sluggish. Spot cotton transactions in the market are intermittent and show no signs of development. 350 bales of Yao flower arrived at the dock and were transacted as follows:</p>
<p>Leigong Flower 35.50　Yihe Factory Imported　200 pieces　Loaded on ships and sent to the factory.</p>

<p>Due to Excessive Piece Goods Inventory</p>
<p>One More Day Off Per Week</p>
<p>The 16th, the Blackmer White Telegraph, the Indian Yarn Factory Association held a meeting here today and passed a resolution to support each yarn factory taking one more day off per week starting February 15. This is because the piece goods inventory in the factories is too thick and the market situation is not good.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Grain, Spot Foreign Rice Rises Two or Three Jiao <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Recent Rise Follows the Increase, Distant Terms Remain Stable. Although foreign rice arrived yesterday and was unloaded, and there was talk of a new ship arriving, the market price instead soared. No. 1 Saigon opened at 14 yuan, 5 jiao, and 3 fen in the morning. In the afternoon, due to competition among local customers, it rose sharply to 14 yuan and 7 jiao, a rise of two jiao compared to the morning. Small Jiaomi initially opened at 13 yuan and a half, then rose to 6 jiao and 3 fen, also rising outside the normal range. The reason is that the rice that arrived this time was previously sold in advance, and there was very little left, so it became extremely scarce. Therefore, only 600 bags of Saigon No. 1 were offered, and 6,000 bags of Small Jiaomi were offered. Over 1,000 bags of Large Jiaomi were also offered, priced at 13 yuan and 1 jiao. Road cargo followed the trend due to the scarcity of spot rice. 1,000 bags of No. 1 road cargo were offered, priced at 14 yuan, 3 jiao to 4 jiao and a half. Distant terms were still stable. The total transaction volume was 30,000 bags of Saigon, Small Jiaomi, Min Dang, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Recent Wheat Contracts Experience Aggressive Price Surge <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market saw a sudden and sharp price surge in the near-term months. However, when prices opened in the morning, they were still calm because foreign wheat was reported at a small 4 jiao increase. The current month opened at 5 taels, 2 qian, flat. However, local customers felt that the current standard market price was about 1 qian cheaper than the price of spot wheat, so they were very willing to buy. Since the current month had this trend, the March and April months also rose successively. As for the new wheat of June and July, it was heard that factories were quite willing to purchase it, so transactions were very smooth. By the afternoon opening, the near-term months saw a continued improvement in the market due to a surge in demand. The sole goal of those going long was that the underlying goods were limited. If they bought as much as possible, they would inevitably run out of money. It seemed like there was an attempt to corner the market, and the future was quite noteworthy. As a result, the February and March months rose by a huge 6 fen compared to the closing price of the previous week, the April month rose by 5 fen, the June month rose by 2 fen, and the July month rose by 3 fen. The spot wheat market was still stable, opening with Mingguang wheat and Nanzhou wheat at 5 taels, 3 qian, and 7 fen, Taizhou wheat at 5 taels, 3 qian, and 6 fen, Shaoxing wheat at 5 taels and 3 qian, and then down to 5 taels, 2 qian, and 2 fen, and Hankou wheat at 5 taels and 3 qian, and 5 taels, 2 qian, and a half. A total of over 2,000 bags were offered, and were bought by Fuxin and Shenda.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Marked Flour Market Turns Soft <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, each month was roughly the same as the closing price of the previous week. The current month had been slightly better by 5 li because there was still an urgent need to cover short positions. The distant terms presented a hovering appearance. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, both the near and distant terms were trending in a weary direction. The near term was because the Tianjin quotation turned smaller, and those going long occasionally sold back. Moreover, because the political situation was fraught with multiple reasons, the actual sales group inevitably had doubts and did not dare to advance smoothly. As for the distant months, half were affected by the near term, and half was because the weather was very good, and people's confidence in the interior ultimately looked weak. Therefore, although the ups and downs were not large, the market was not as firm as before. Looking at the future situation, if problems occur in sales to the north, it may be necessary to soften a little further. As a result, the current month was down 7.5 li compared to the closing of the previous week, March was down 1 fen, April was down 1.5 fen, May and June were down 7.5 li, and July was down 5 li.</p>

<p>The yellow and white coarse silk produced in Anhui and Hubei provinces is sold extensively in England and France. Because the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau is scheduled to implement inspection and testing of exported Chinese silk on March 1, if the Anhui and Hubei yellow and white silk are subjected to baking tests, the color of the silk will inevitably change and the silk threads will become brittle, which does not meet the needs of Europe and America. It will inevitably be ignored and difficult to comply with. Representatives have now been elected to petition for exemption from inspection.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Piece Goods, Guangdong Merchants Scramble for Fine Twill Fiercely <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Tense Situation, Sichuan and Hubei Merchants First Announce Suspension</p>
<p>The factory's cotton cloth sells very well. Guangdong merchants have been trading fine twill for over 500 pieces in recent days, so domestic goods have suddenly become popular. Changzhou goods such as Butterfly Ball, opening at 5 taels, 9 qian, and a half, and Flying Bear, 5 taels, 8 qian, and a half, also sell quite a bit. This street is more interested in fine cloth. After rumors arose regarding the political situation, customer groups seemed a bit wooden, and spot goods gradually increased. 9-pound coarse cloth fell 2 and a half fen yesterday, and the rest remained stable. This street also traded 16-pound goods. Only the 16-pound Five Yuanbao coarse twill has a way to sell dyed blanks, and the rest are sluggish.</p>
<p>The situation in the East and West piece goods market is chaotic. The East's tribute flannel suddenly softened again. Double Child Deer has opened at 2 qian, 3 fen, and a half. Moganshan Hunter Goose Muqiu is at 2 qian and 6 fen when entering customs. Only Changbanqiao has risen 2 li and a half, opening at 2 qian, 7 fen, and 2 li and a half, because this street's Taizhou and Tongzhou merchants are actively purchasing. Blue Strip Satin continues to be small, Zijinshan Xiaodebao uniformly sells for 1 qian, 6 fen, and 7 li and a half, and new strips are all 1 qian, 7 fen to 7 fen and a half. Floral cloth sells quite smoothly, but the inventory is also large, so it is difficult to rise in price. Sales are smoother on this street. Sichuan and Hubei merchants have unanimously suspended business. Jiujiang, Wuhu, Ningbo, and other merchants still have sporadic sales. Among Western goods, yesterday the poplin was the most active, and both local customers were adding to their purchases. Fair's Longjingsi was 5 qian and 5 fen, and Bazhentu was 4 qian and 4 fen, both of which were traded.</p>
<h3 id="e139">North-South Goods, White Lotus Land Prices Rise Repeatedly <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the white lotus has had a thin inventory, and land prices have risen repeatedly, trending quite tightly. Lanxi has risen from 41-42 yuan to 45-46 yuan, and here it has also risen from 32-33 taels to 35-36 taels. Hunan shipping is currently flat, but the Hankou market is still tight. According to reports, each is 22 taels and 2 qian to 21 taels. The Shanghai market is not smooth, with only sporadic transactions in recent days. Guang merchants have few buyers. Yesterday's market prices were Xiangtan shipping at 42 taels, Hengzhou shipping at 39 taels, Jiuxi shipping at 38 taels, and Changde shipping at 36 taels and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Seafood, Kelp Arrival is Scarce, Market Rises <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The production price of kelp is gradually rising, which is the opposite of the Shanghai market trend. Therefore, the firms have tightened their hands on goods and are generally unwilling to sell them. Moreover, the inventory of each shop has long been exhausted, and the source of production goods has long been lacking due to the relationship between the expensive price. As a result, customers often need to prepare for a shortage of goods on the market, so the market is also rising step by step. The day before yesterday, traders who were hawking already shouted for price increases. Nemuro kelp was 6 taels and 6 qian, Hamamaka, Kunashiri, Kawaji, and Akkeshi were 6 taels and 3-4 qian, Guizhuang was 6 taels and 1 qian, head kelp was 6 taels, down to 5 taels and 8 qian, secondary quality was 5 taels and 2 qian, cat's paw was 4 taels and 8-9 qian, and snake skin was 5 taels and 7 qian. Compared to the red market, each grade has risen by a huge 5-6 qian. According to people in the industry, if the production goods do not arrive for another ten days, the market goods may be in short supply.</p>

<p>Grand Opening Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bank held its opening ceremony at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. The grand occasion is described in detail below:</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony: At 8:40 a.m., the clock rang. First, General Manager Xu Shengchan, Manager Gu Yinong, Deputy Manager Chen Zhangwen, and all staff members performed a meeting ceremony. Next, the Deputy Manager performed the opening ceremony. Then, the General Manager gave a training speech to all the staff, stating that the main purpose of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Bank was to (1) concentrate the city's wealth, (2) unify the city's income and expenditure, (3) adjust the city's finances, and (4) develop the city's business. Therefore, all countries attach great importance to municipal banks. China did not have one before. The Capital Special Municipality was established the year before last. This bank is actually the second. Now it is in the germination stage. Although the funds are only 1 million yuan, since this bank holds the general hub of the city's finances, there is no end to its future business. Even if only the income and expenditure of the municipal government are counted, the annual amount is already very large. In addition, with the various exchanges of industry and commerce and the public, as well as the various equipment for the city's business, the development of the future has no limits. I encourage you all, etc.</p>
<p>Guests: Those who attended included Zhang Yongni, Vice Minister of Finance; Zhang Xiqing, Lianghuai Salt Transport Envoy; Ren Guangyu, Chief of Staff of the Naval Headquarters; Chen Xunyong, Fleet Commander; Yin Yinong, former Director of the Navigation Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications; Zhu Shoumei, Director of the Management Department of the Headquarters; Wu Qiding, Director of the Jiangsu Shatian Official Property Affairs Bureau; Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Qian'an, Lu Jianquan, Li Fuxun, Tang Shoumin, Bei Songsun, Xie Hengchuang, Ye Kuichu, Xu Jiqing, Wu Zhihao, Yuan Lidun, Zhu Chengzhang, Shen Lianfang, Zhou Peizhen, Lu Daizhi, the Director of the Secretariat of the Municipal Government Council, and the heads of various bureaus, as well as important staff members from various banks and companies, totaling more than 1,000 people.</p>
<p>Meeting: At 9:00 a.m., the clock rang nine times, announcing the start of the meeting. The meeting was presided over by Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government Council Bureau, representing Mayor Zhang. (1) Playing music to open the bank, (2) Chairman, representatives of various agencies, and all participating guests and staff members take their seats, (3) bowing three times to the national flag and party flag, (4) Chairman respectfully reads the President's will, (5) three minutes of silence, (6) directors, supervisors, general manager, and deputy general manager swear to take office, (7) guests deliver congratulatory speeches, (8) chairman's reply, (9) completion of the ceremony and playing of music, (10) tea and refreshments.</p>
<p>Speeches: First, Xu Jiqing delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the guests, saying, "To promote the development of industry and commerce and the advancement of culture in a city, it is necessary to first improve the municipal administration and engage in construction, and finance is the general hub. The Shanghai Municipal Government used to be corrupt and never considered construction, so there was no special bank. Since General Zhang Gongyue took over the municipal government, the establishment of a municipal bank was planned. Since Xu Gongshengchan has been in charge of the Finance Bureau, the municipal bank has been realized. The municipal bank manages the city's finances, so it assists in municipal construction and protects the welfare of the public. Its mission is significant and cannot be compared to ordinary financial institutions. After months of preparation, the business plan has been successfully completed. In the future, we will see the spread of grand plans, the promotion of the city's civilization, and the realization of the plan for a Greater Shanghai. Its reputation will be known throughout the country. It will be more than just a bank for the citizens. Today, on the grand opening ceremony, I respectfully offer these humble words to express my congratulations." Next, Xie Hengchuang, Chu Minyi, and others gave speeches one after another, saying that the municipal bank assists in the construction of the municipal administration and promotes the development of municipal business, which benefits all citizens and the public. We know that it will definitely thrive in the future, and the greatness of the future can be predicted.</p>
<p>Chairman's Reply: Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, gave a reply on behalf of Chairman Zhang, saying, "Today is the opening of the Shanghai Municipal Bank. Mayor Zhang has gone to Fujian on official business and could not come, so he specially ordered his brother to attend the meeting and participate in the ceremony. I respectfully represent the municipal government and say a few words: (1) Although the municipal bank was founded by the municipal government, its success is due to the vigorous support of all the advanced people in the industrial, commercial, and financial circles. On this point, I must thank you on behalf of the municipal government. (2) From the preparation to today's opening, the planning and equipment have taken a lot of effort. Fortunately, all the directors, supervisors, general manager, and deputy general manager have spared no effort in planning carefully and logically. Looking at the achievements of today's founding, we can use this as a guarantee for future development. On this point, I should also express my great joy on behalf of the municipal government. (3) Today, I am honored to have guests from all walks of life come to guide us and offer generous gifts. However, due to the narrow space, it is very crowded, and the hospitality is inadequate. On this point, I will express my deep apologies on behalf of the municipal government, and I hope everyone will forgive me. (4) The municipal bank is in its initial stage, and the scale is roughly complete. Everything depends on the guidance of all the advanced people, and I especially hope that the industrial, commercial, and financial circles and all the citizens will do their best to support us, so that the foundation of the municipal bank will be consolidated day by day, and the business will develop day by day, so as to realize the plan of the late President for a Greater Shanghai. On this point, I should especially express the municipal government's great hope."</p>

If I violate my oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment from the party. This is my oath.)"</p>

<h3 id="e142">Industry and Commerce Department Shanghai Office Discusses Silver Prices <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Over Ten Business Leaders from France, Japan, Germany, and Italy Arrive</p>
<p>Mitsui Bank President Tsuchiya Proposes Banning Gold Exports</p>
<p>Zhao Jinqing, Director of the Industry and Commerce Department's Shanghai Office, to address the issue of declining silver prices, previously invited business leaders from China, Britain, the United States, and other countries in Shanghai last Wednesday to a meeting for discussion and to seek opinions for adoption by the National Government and submission to the League of Nations. Yesterday afternoon, Zhao invited leaders of French, Japanese, German, and Italian commercial organizations in Shanghai for a second informal exchange of views at the Industry and Commerce Department's Shanghai Office in the Jianghai Customs Building. Those present included Mr. Dubosq, President of the French Chamber of Commerce; Mr. Miri, President of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce; Mr. Vogel, President of the German Chamber of Commerce; Mr. Fumagalli, President of the Italian Chamber of Commerce; Mr. Tsuchiya, President of Mitsui Bank; Mr. Hirtz, President of Banque de l'Indochine; Mr. Last, President of Deutsch-Asiatische Bank; Mr. Hattori, President of the Bank of Chosen; Mr. Charlotte, Manager of Arnhold Trading Company; and from the Chinese side, Zhao Jinqing, Zhu Chengzhang, Xia Jinlin, Qin Runqing, Lin Kanghou, Hu Xiansheng, Shou Jingwei, Zhang Xianglin, Gao Lu, Li Weimin, and over ten others.  After approximately two hours of exchanging opinions, the main points of each party can be summarized into three: (1) the suggestion of Mitsui Bank's Tsuchiya; (2) requesting the governments of India and Annam to temporarily suspend the sale of silver to China for a period of two years; (3) the National Government should order customs to prohibit the export of cash; (4) the German and French proposal to maintain peace and restore domestic transportation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhao Jinqing stated in his address: "Today we are discussing the silver price problem. I am extremely delighted that you gentlemen have graced us with your presence. As leaders of French, Japanese, German, and Italian commercial organizations in Shanghai, your willingness to come is appreciated, and I trust you will provide valuable guidance. Recently, silver prices have fallen again, and the resulting impact will inevitably lead to a continued increase in commodity prices. This will impede China's import trade on the one hand, and have a very negative impact on export commerce on the other. Both Chinese and foreign merchants are suffering. Therefore, the low silver price has become an international problem.  Low silver prices are not only a major obstacle to the development of Chinese industry and commerce, but also severely harm international trade. The government is currently planning to implement various measures, but this matter is of great importance and requires collective wisdom and broad consultation. We have convened this informal meeting to discuss various relief methods, hoping to contribute something that the government can adopt and implement. Last Wednesday, business leaders from China, Britain, and the United States also gathered for a similar discussion. Today, I hope that you gentlemen will express your views as much as possible."</p>
<p>Opinions from All Parties: After Zhao Jinqing's speech, the business representatives from various countries present expressed their opinions. The suggestion from Mr. Tsuchiya, President of Mitsui Bank, was the most specific. Mr. Tsuchiya's suggestion was, in brief: to alleviate the preciousness of gold and the cheapness of silver, the first step is to ban gold exports. This measure has been implemented in various European and American countries in the past. Even in Japan, it was implemented for fifteen years before being lifted recently. Because China has very little cash reserves, if exports are prohibited, there will be no need to purchase foreign exchange for gold, and the price of gold will naturally fall, while the price of silver will rise. Some say that gold trading in Shanghai is all about selling short and buying long, and that there is no real trading in gold bars. However, last Saturday, 10,000 gold pounds were exported, and this amount is not small. Secondly, the National Government can consult with major silver countries, such as Annam and India, to ensure that they do not sell silver to China for two years. Qin Runqing, President of the China Reclamation Bank, said that the paper currency issued by various banks in Shanghai totals 200 million yuan. If a reserve of 60% is maintained as required, then 120 million yuan in silver is needed. Shanghai has a total of 200 million yuan in silver, which is not much. Mr. Hirtz, President of Banque de l'Indochine, and other French, German, and Italian figures argued that artificial methods are insufficient to alleviate the trend of expensive gold and cheap silver. The fundamental solution lies in China maintaining peace and quickly restoring national transportation so that the silver stored in Shanghai can circulate. According to some sources, once the silver stored in Shanghai circulates inland, foreign silver will inevitably flood in. Even from Annam alone, there are 20 million yuan in silver currency, of which 7 million yuan has already been imported into China, and the rest is waiting for an opportunity to be imported into China. The National Government's order to prohibit the import of silver coins into China is also for this reason.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Li Fusun's Opinions on the Decline in Silver Prices <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Reporters from various newspapers specifically sought the opinion of Mr. Li Fusun on the matter of the decline in silver prices. Mr. Li is the Chairman of the Bank of China and is very knowledgeable in economics and experienced in commerce.  His remarks are recorded below:</p>
<p>Mr. Li said, "The current low silver price is largely due to international reasons, which we cannot control. However, there is an important point, which is that due to the low silver price, there is panic in Shanghai, and its impact extends to other markets internationally. In my opinion, panic is not necessary. The main reasons for the recent decline in silver prices are two: (1) The currency system of Indochina has changed from a pure silver standard to a virtual gold standard, which was completed at the end of January of this year. The method is to convert all the silver reserves of the Banque de l'Indochine (the sole issuer of banknotes) into gold reserves within six months, requiring approximately 5 to 6 million pounds of gold, mostly purchased from the Shanghai market. (2) After adopting the gold standard, the Indian financial authorities have repeatedly secretly sold the silver obtained from melting coins in the London market.  Their sales are neither at a fixed time nor at a fixed price, and their attitude is very difficult to grasp.  Outsiders often exaggerate their words, occasionally causing panic in the market. The above two are the so-called international reasons.  However, these two reasons have already affected the silver market in the past, so if no other reasons occur, the current low silver price can be said to have reached its limit, or is not far from its limit. At this time, we should regard it as a period of recovery, not a period of panic. Those who discuss the silver market today often fail to consider that Shanghai is the storage place for the nation's silver reserves. It must be known that the silver stored in Shanghai is not purely the silver stored in Shanghai alone; it actually includes the silver reserves for the banknotes circulating in this port and the country. If industry develops in the future, commerce and goods sell well, and the amount of banknotes issued increases, then this silver reserve will also increase. Banknotes are merely representatives of silver. Issuing banknotes requires storing a considerable amount of cash for redemption. Therefore, the large amount of silver stored in Shanghai should not affect the silver market and cause its price to fall.  Most of the silver stored there is actually no different from being stored inland. It is a mistake to base discussions of the silver market solely on the statistics of silver stored in Shanghai, without considering that this stored silver is a banknote reserve or goods for sale. As for why large amounts of silver are concentrated in Shanghai, it is because the situation has not yet stabilized. Historically, when military events occur, Shanghai has been the nation's silver treasury. In the future, when peace lasts a little longer, the silver will inevitably disperse inland, and the banks in the major ports that now deposit silver reserves in Shanghai will at that time convert some of it to be stored in their respective locations, no longer concentrated in Shanghai. In addition, there is also a common misconception that if our country adopts the gold standard, the use of silver in our country will inevitably decrease. Regarding this issue, it can be discussed from the following two points: (1) At this time, it is not easy for our country to suddenly change from the silver standard to the gold standard. In my opinion, it should be done when the situation is more favorable than it is now. However, before I see the report of the Kemmerer Financial Advisory Group, I am unable to make a final conclusion. (2) Minister of Finance Song stated that even if China adopts the gold standard, the currency in the country will not be gold coins but still silver coins, indicating that although our country's currency system may be improved, the use of silver in the country will not be greatly reduced. I am saying this because I do not want to give the impression that I want to control the market situation. This is definitely beyond my ability, because the Shanghai silver market is governed by economic principles and political reasons, and will never be swayed by any optimistic remarks. However, it is my wish that we should try to use common sense to restore the market situation and not be moved by rumors. Over the years, the silver market in Shanghai has been loose, and the capital available for productive enterprises is more abundant than ever before. If merchants can take advantage of the opportunity and devote themselves to productive enterprises, then what they do is in line with economic principles. On the one hand, politically, I also hope that the government will quickly promulgate laws to protect industry and commerce to promote their progress, and the silver market will naturally return to calm. In short, instead of focusing on strategies to save the silver market, it is better to shift your gaze and skills to the restoration of economic order and the development of industry and commerce, so that the demand for silver coins increases and the value of silver naturally rises."</p>

<p>48,000 Bags</p>
<p>Due to the lack of food in Shanghai, rice merchants are rushing to bring Saigon rice to Shanghai to maintain the people's livelihood. In recent days, various ports in North China have also come to Shanghai to purchase and transport large amounts of rice to Tianjin. The Zhejiang side is also purchasing over a million piculs of foreign rice from Annam to provide relief to disaster-stricken counties. British, Japanese, and French shipping companies in Shanghai have dispatched more than twenty ships to transport this rice, planning to ship 3 to 4 million piculs to Shanghai within two months. Yesterday, 48,000 bags arrived and are currently being unloaded.</p>

January: 1,506,190 people, 310,809 households; February: 1,499,592 people, 310,849 households; March: 1,504,024 people, 311,965 households; April: 1,509,963 people, 313,526 households; May: 1,513,874 people, 314,839 households; June: 1,525,562 people, 318,629 households; July: 1,547,384 people, 324,586 households; August: 1,559,671 people, 327,978 households; September: 1,573,833 people, 331,554 households; October: 1,591,517 people, 335,546 households; November: 1,609,663 people, 339,627 households; December: 1,620,187 people, 341,785 households.</p>
<p>It is reported that the number of households in December 1928 was 313,14. The difference between the increase and decrease in the number of households for the whole year was the sharpest decrease in the number of households in January, and the decrease in the population was the lowest in January and February. After that, it gradually increased, with the largest increase rate in July. According to the bureau's investigation, the main reasons for the increase or decrease, in addition to the fact that the number of households changed in January had just been investigated in the previous year and had not been re-investigated, and the reason was unknown, most of the decrease in the population was due to death exceeding birth, in addition to the decrease in household migration. The main reasons for the monthly increase after February are that municipal facilities are becoming more and more perfect, and public security administration is also actively reorganized. Residents have generally obtained security guarantees and welfare increases, so more and more people are moving into the city.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Procedures for Applying for Loss of Nationality <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Personnel Should Be Dispatched for Investigation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government yesterday issued an order to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, stating: "In order to comply with the matter, according to the Ministry of Interior's inquiry, after investigating the matter of people applying for loss of nationality, in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Nationality Law, the Ministry of Interior shall not permit the loss of nationality if one of the following circumstances exists: (1) Having reached the age of military service, not being exempt from military service obligations, and not yet having performed military service; (2) Currently serving in the military; (3) Currently holding a Chinese civil or military position. Furthermore, according to the provisions of Article 13 of the same law, even if one meets the provisions of Article 12 of the same law, one shall still not lose nationality if one of the following circumstances exists: (1) Being a criminal suspect or defendant; (2) Having been sentenced and the execution has not yet ended; (3) Being a civil defendant; (4) The compulsory execution has not yet ended; (5) Having been declared bankrupt and not yet reinstated; (6) Having overdue taxes or having been subject to overdue tax penalties that have not yet ended. Furthermore, according to the provisions of Article 14 of the same law, those who lose nationality lose the rights that non-Chinese people cannot enjoy. If a person who loses nationality has enjoyed the aforementioned rights before losing nationality, if they do not transfer them to a Chinese person within one year after losing nationality, the rights shall belong to the national treasury. The original intention was to prevent people from attempting to evade obligations by losing nationality. The Ministry previously issued application forms and stipulated that whether the person applying for loss of nationality has any of the circumstances in Article 12 or Article 13 of the Nationality Law, and whether they have any rights that should be lost under Article 14 of the same law, should be indicated separately in the application form for verification. In the future, regarding cases of people applying for loss of nationality, the competent local official office or embassy should urgently dispatch appropriate personnel to local courts and chambers of commerce to thoroughly investigate and order them to obtain a guarantee letter from two or more reputable shops established by Chinese people in the Chinese place of residence, and after the reviewing agency has reviewed it and found no discrepancies, it should be sent to the Ministry of Interior for verification with a truthful endorsement, so as to ensure prudence and prevent fraud. In addition to distributing the information, we are also consulting your government to investigate and instruct your subordinates to comply with the handling, etc. With this approval, we order the bureau to comply with the handling. This order."</p>

<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Traffic is inevitably blocked, but many products have been sent from various places. The first batch was fully transported to Yangshupu yesterday and loaded on a ship, entrusted to the Japanese mail ship Kitayama Maru for transportation. It is scheduled to leave the sea this morning and arrive in Anvers, Belgium, on March 28. Nong Ruhui and Tian Dingcheng, secretaries of the exposition representative, are scheduled to depart on the French mail ship Anlai Lai Peng on the 22nd of this month. The details of the matter are recorded below.</p>
<p>Exhibits: This collection of special products from various places is divided into three categories: agriculture, industry and commerce, and education. The first batch totaled 103 boxes, with more than 18,000 pieces. It is reported that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has now allocated another 10,000 yuan to purchase special products from various places, which will be sent in batches along with the continued arrival of various pieces from various places.</p>
<p>Gifts: Chinese tea merchants, in view of the fact that the number of foreign trade sales has decreased in recent years, and the position of Chinese flower and leaf teas has been gradually occupied by products from Japan, Ceylon, and other places, are taking this opportunity to urgently try to recover their rights and interests. They have specially prepared 10,106 cans of high-quality tea of various colors (four taels per can), packed in 52 boxes, which were also loaded on the ship yesterday and sent to the association for distribution for publicity.</p>

<h3 id="e151">International Opium Suppression Investigators Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>A Group of Four</p>
<p>Wen Hui Bao reported that the commission of the League of Nations investigating the opium situation in the Far East, after investigating Burma, British Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Siam, Hong Kong, and other places, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (16th). The whole group consists of four people, with Axel Ekstrand, the Swedish Minister to Argentina, as the director, and Charles Kittar, the President of the Belgian Political and Economic Association, and Dr. Halaša, the former Czechoslovak Minister to Brazil, as members. Leng Bo, an official of the League of Nations Secretariat, is the accompanying secretary. It is reported that the French Concession authorities have already treated them well.</p>
<h3 id="e152">This Year's Progress in Opium Suppression in the City <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau lists and reports on opium suppression to the Municipal Government and the Opium Suppression Committee on a regular basis for performance evaluation. It is reported that the bureau has listed and submitted the progress of opium suppression in the first half of this year, from July to the end of the year of 1929, for verification and transfer. In summary, the bureau's opium suppression work, all matters related to the examination of public officials' regulations, still refer to the chapters and regulations for the affiliated officials and police, who are responsible for reporting. For several months, strict examinations have been conducted, and no suspicious points have been found. In fact, it has been effective. However, the elimination of drug atmosphere is the first to stop trafficking, and the two Chinese and French concessions in Shanghai are adjacent to each other, with convenient transportation in all directions, making prevention difficult. The bureau has repeatedly ordered the land and water police teams to seriously investigate at railway stations, harbors, land and water ports, and at the junction of the Chinese and French concessions. In addition, recently, traitors and rioters have often lured rural women to carry smuggled opium and guns, hoping to smuggle them. The bureau immediately recruited female inspectors and distributed them to various districts and offices to carry out inspections, which was quite fruitful, especially in the 5th and 2nd districts of the water patrol team, where more trafficking cases were detected. There were often more than 20 cases of opium seized in a month. The bureau has reported the cases separately, and rewarded those who have contributed to encourage them. As for the prohibition of smoking, opening lights for sale and smoking has long been strictly prohibited, but those who have been deeply infected with the habit of smoking privately are still unavoidable. Every time the bureau cracks a case, the perpetrators are dealt with according to the severity of their crimes, and are transferred to the court along with the evidence for legal action. The effect of opium suppression in each district office is listed and reported at the end of the month, and is carefully assessed and punished or rewarded as appropriate. In the first half of the year, the bureau handled a total of 1,104 cases of trafficking, selling, and smoking opium, an increase of 389 cases compared with the first half of the year. More than 48,000 taels of miscellaneous opium and opium paste were seized, and more than 520 boxes of red pills and morphine were seized, almost an increase of four-fifths compared with the previous half year. The reason for this is that although it is caused by the serious investigation of the various districts and teams, it is also because of the recent unrest in the local area, increased unemployment, and the rush of dangerous people to gather together, regardless of violating the law, and secretly plotting to sell for profit. Once strictly investigated and banned, all of them were cracked down. This is the actual situation of the increase in opium cases.</p>

<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Joint Association sent a telegram to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday, stating: "We have investigated that our country's gauze and satin are sold to Japan, South Korea, and other places in large numbers. In the autumn of 1924, the Japanese government suddenly designated our country's silk as a luxury item and imposed a heavy tax of 100% of the value, resulting in the disappearance of goods for the past six or seven years. The losses of the silk industry are more than several million. The unemployed industry and commerce have not been able to obtain relief. Our associations have been appealing for years and sending telegrams back and forth, but it is difficult to bet on effectiveness. Fortunately, now is the time to start revising the Sino-Japanese treaty. We beg your government, court, and departments to consider that this matter is related to the national economy and people's livelihood, and is a very important issue that should be addressed in advance. If they do not agree, please ask the national government to immediately implement the same tax rate on foreign goods coming to China to show equality and save the people's livelihood. We cannot bear the urgency of our prayers. Respectfully, the China National Goods Maintenance Association and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Joint Association."</p>

Yesterday, due to the numerous official duties in Shanghai, and because Mr. Yano, the secretary of the Japanese Embassy in Peiping, is currently in Shanghai, all important matters need to be discussed in person, so the departure date has been postponed for several days, and he must go to Beijing by Friday at the latest.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Regarding the Petition to Cancel the Autumn Cocoon Silk Tax <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Huang Jin Shen, Chairman of the General Silk and Cocoon Association Committee of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, submitted a request yesterday to the finance department.</p>
<p>It concerns the matter of autumn cocoons being exempt from tax and a request to cancel the silk tax, which was instructed on October 10 of the previous year in document number three: "Upon reviewing the received documents, including the telegram from the Yiyang Association (omitted portion), you are to comply accordingly." Upon receiving this instruction, and noting that over four months have passed without knowing whether Zhejiang province has implemented any improved measures or replied to Suzhou, we have been waiting anxiously. The association has carefully translated the sections of the instruction and must urgently make the following clarifications regarding the facts: (1) Exempting cocoon tax without exempting silk tax. In Suzhou province, only the monthly cocoon tax has been levied on local silk cocoons; there is no silk tax. Each hundred catties of dry cocoons from various cocoon-producing counties are subject to a cocoon tax of twelve yuan and forty cents. Even Wuxi county reports and pays taxes based on the amount of silk reeled from cocoons, not as a silk tax. This is the case for spring cocoons, let alone autumn cocoons. Therefore, the autumn cocoon silk tax should be canceled. (2) Exempting the autumn cocoon tax is to show consideration for silkworm farmers, not to favor capital factories. Autumn silkworm rearing is not initiated by silkworm farmers themselves; silk cocoon merchants produce autumn seeds and distribute them to the farmers. Significant expenses are incurred in setting up cold storage facilities during the seed production stage, and generous cocoon prices are offered after the cocoons are harvested to encourage farmers, all to increase production and compensate for the insufficient spring silkworm yield. Therefore, merchants play a proactive role in the development of autumn cocoons, while silkworm farmers are reactive. The Zhejiang province measures may misunderstand the source of autumn seeds by only considering silkworm farmers. Silk cocoon merchants deserve to share the preferential treatment with the diligent silkworm farmers for their painstaking efforts in autumn seed production. Therefore, the autumn cocoon silk tax should be canceled for this reason as well. (3) Tax exemption for inland areas is already a concession. Silk factories in treaty ports, some of which are established by foreigners, enjoy the benefit of tax exemption, while inland silk factories, which are purely Chinese-owned, are not. This preferential treatment of foreigners over Chinese is a flawed perspective in Zhejiang province, and such measures can easily lead to malpractices. Japan, being a strong competitor in raw silk, faces a shortage of raw materials and relies on purchasing fresh cocoons from China. The autumn seeds painstakingly developed by our silk merchants are used to supply raw materials to foreigners, with tax-free direct exports. In essence, the efforts of silk merchants and the diligence of silkworm farmers are benefiting others. The government would surely not want to adopt such a strategy. Therefore, the autumn cocoon silk tax should be canceled for this reason as well. (4) Silk reeled from silk factories in treaty ports and transported to inland areas is also subject to tax. Silk factories generally produce raw silk for export trade, unlike native silk. All silk products from treaty ports are declared and shipped out locally; there is no reason to transport them to inland areas. The fourth provision of the original measure becomes redundant if the sales channels of factory silk are clear. As for inland silk factories, their monthly output cannot be exported without being transported to treaty ports. Therefore, the tax exemption is merely a verbal promise, creating a new silk tax under the guise of exempting cocoon tax. Although explanations are provided, they only create more doubts. Therefore, the autumn cocoon silk tax should be canceled for this reason as well. In summary, regarding the fundamental aspects of this matter: (1) It must be understood that there is no silk tax in inland areas, only a cocoon tax. Once the cocoon tax is exempted, there is no silk tax to speak of. (2) It must be understood that factory silk is sold to Europe and America through treaty ports, and there is no reason to transport it to inland areas, so there is no silk tax to collect. If the government considers these two points, it will understand that the repeated requests are not unfounded complaints. The development of autumn cocoons is only two years old, and both Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have seen positive results, with Wuxi county in particular demonstrating high yields. In the future, with sufficient seed production, the output will be no less than that of spring cocoons. If this opaque and fragmented approach is adopted, it will lead to significant malpractices, being lenient towards treaty ports and harsh towards inland areas, akin to driving fish into the depths, granting foreigners the benefit of absorbing raw materials. The hard work of silk merchants in seed production and the diligence of silkworm farmers will instead be used to supply the deficiencies of strong neighbors. Why then bother with such active promotion? The unresolved case has been pending for over half a year, and autumn seed production must soon be prepared. Unless the original measures are thoroughly changed and the previously unheard-of silk tax is completely canceled, the government's intention to promote autumn cocoons will be counterproductive. Industry is the foundation of the country, and the government and merchants are closely intertwined. Matters of the day should be clarified promptly. We earnestly request your acceptance of the above points and the fundamental cancellation of the autumn cocoon silk tax, as well as a thorough improvement of the original tax exemption measures to eliminate obstacles and maintain the silk industry for the public good.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Compilation of Commemorative Week Activities in Various Institutions <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Executive Committee held its 47th Sun Yat-sen Commemorative Week yesterday at 9:30 AM. Over 200 attendees included members of the Executive and Supervisory Committees, along with guests. Chairman Tang Demin presided and delivered a report analyzing the content of Yan Xishan's telegram, forcefully pointing out its absurdities, hoping that all comrades and compatriots in the city would deeply understand and unanimously urge Comrade Yan to come to his senses. He also hoped that under the leadership of Party Leader Chiang Kai-shek, they would unite as one, further consolidating the foundation of the Party and the nation. The ceremony then concluded.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government held its Sun Yat-sen Commemorative Week yesterday at 9:00 AM. Chairman Sun Baorong presided, performing the rituals as prescribed. Section member Chen of the Fifth Section delivered a training report on the domestic and international political situation of the past week. The ceremony concluded after 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau held its 75th Sun Yat-sen Commemorative Week on the 17th at 10:00 AM. Chairman Pan Gongzhan presided. Section Chief Sun Jianhou of the First Section reported on bureau affairs, and Section Chief Feng Liutang of the Fourth Section reported on domestic and international current events. Finally, Director Pan gave a speech, repeatedly dissecting (the morality advocated by the Kuomintang) with extensive evidence. The main point was that revolutionaries must possess the necessary morality to restore the nation's position, and they must first restore the nation's inherent morality. Therefore, the Communist Party's slogan of "revolution without morality" should not be used to numb the youth. As for the morality advocated by the Kuomintang, it includes loyalty, filial piety, trustworthiness, righteousness, benevolence, love, and peace, all of which Chinese people should have. Those who consider themselves revolutionaries, whether they are party members or work in political institutions or the military under party rule, must first have these virtues. To have these virtues, they must possess the following four spirits: (1) serving the public, (2) determination to sacrifice, (3) unity and love, and (4) strict adherence to discipline. The repeated betrayals of the nation, the inability to eradicate corruption and evil, and the inevitable problems of disorganization and inefficiency in various institutions are all due to revolutionaries not understanding the morality they should have. He hoped that colleagues would encourage each other and strive to serve.</p>

<h3 id="e158">The China National Products Maintenance Association Cables for Support of the Nanyang Tobacco Factory <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The China National Products Maintenance Association considers the continuous losses of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and the cessation of factory operations a major blow to the future of the national products industry. The Executive Committee resolved to cable the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting substantial support and assistance to revive the business, so that factory operations can continue to develop and workers will not lose their jobs. The original telegram is as follows: "We have recently heard that the Shanghai factory of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Co., Ltd. has suffered from various environmental pressures in recent years, incurring significant losses and unable to sustain itself, leading to the suspension of operations and closure of the factory. Upon learning this news, we are shocked and dismayed. We believe that this company is a giant in China's tobacco industry. Over the years, it has received support from the people of the country, and its business has flourished throughout the country, initially helping to recover some of the huge annual losses in the industry. However, compared with foreign merchants, it still feels financially weak and lagging behind. Unfortunately, it has recently been hit by frequent labor unrest and heavy taxes, leading to a rapid decline in business. Now it is unable to maintain operations and has even closed down. Not only are the company's years of hard work and dedication wasted, but the thousands of workers who depend on it for a living, as well as the promising future of China's tobacco industry, are also cut off. Thinking of this, we deeply regret the future of national products. Moreover, at a time when the gold price crisis is raging, our government is making painstaking efforts to provide relief, with clear statements on developing industry, using national products, increasing production, and reducing taxes on national products. The people of the country are deeply gratified, but we never expected that Shanghai's leading industrial factory would be forced to sacrifice under the constraints of a severe environment. This runs counter to the intentions of our government and is completely different. Our association, being a national product group, and at this critical juncture for the survival of the national products industry, dares to offer our humble opinion, hoping to be accepted. We believe that although the Nanyang Tobacco Company is only in the tobacco industry, it is of great importance to the future of national products, people's livelihood, and the national economy. At this time of factory closure and suspension of operations, we earnestly request your departments, governments, and courts to allocate funds to maintain and continue operations, and to lift the heavy taxes imposed in recent years, in order to restore the original tax situation of three years ago. At the same time, please increase the import tariffs on foreign tobacco and implement a production tax on products manufactured by foreign merchants in China, in order to implement a policy of protecting national products trade and to comply with the Premier's legacy on people's livelihood. This is what our association urgently presents and appeals for adoption and implementation, in order to provide relief. We are extremely anxious and cannot express all our thoughts. We await your instructions. China National Products Maintenance Association Standing Committee Members Wang Jiean, Wang Xingyi, and Wang Hanqiang respectfully kowtow."</p>

<p>Lack of Silk for Shipment to the United States. Since the reduction of freight charges for Chinese silk on Pacific liners, most of the silk stored in Shanghai has been rushed to the United States within the past two weeks. Recently, the port has shown a shortage of silk for export. The reason is that various silk factories in Shanghai have been shut down for a long time, resulting in a minimal amount of goods being shipped, which has delayed delivery and affected exports. According to various shipping companies, it will take about three to four weeks before silk can be loaded, and operations are currently at a standstill.</p>
<p>New York Reduces Freight Charges. Various shipping companies on the Sino-U.S. New York route have invited representatives from all shipping companies to discuss competitive business methods in response to the Japanese shipping lines' excessive reduction of freight rates. Except for the freight charges for Zhejiang silk, which will be discussed separately, the export freight rates for all other goods have been reduced uniformly starting yesterday (17th), with a further 20% reduction on the already reduced rates to enhance competitiveness. For example, mineral sand has been reduced from 10 yuan to 8 yuan per ton, pig bristles from 20 yuan to 16 yuan, wool from 12 yuan to 10 yuan, leather from 10 yuan to 7.5 yuan, duck feathers from 14.5 yuan to 11.5 yuan, cotton yarn from 10 yuan to 8 yuan, eggs from 15 yuan to 12 yuan, and rhubarb from 15 yuan to 12 yuan. For goods not listed in the designated freight rate list, the rate has been reduced from 15 yuan to 14 yuan. Yesterday, the union has notified all customers that the rate is collected in US dollars, with each ton occupying 40 cubic feet or weighing 2,240 pounds, and the standard is applicable to ships traveling through the Panama Canal.</p>

<p>Ningbo commercial organizations are opposing the four companies on the Shanghai-Ningbo route increasing freight charges. They have submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to stop the increase and are discussing the establishment of a new Shanghai-Ningbo steamer company to fundamentally resolve the issue. At the end of last month, a meeting was held to determine the establishment cost to be 500,000 yuan, divided into 100,000 shares, with the initial purchase of a steamer to operate between Shanghai and Ningbo. In order to expedite the establishment, Ningbo merchants in Shanghai have been notified to attend the inaugural meeting of the Shanghai-Ningbo New Steamer in Ningbo on the 18th to discuss fundraising, share collection, and ship purchase procedures.

<h3 id="e162">Disaster Report from Yuhuan, Eastern Zhejiang <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Association received a telegram from the Yuhuan County Chamber of Commerce yesterday: "Yuhuan County is experiencing an unprecedented disaster in 200 years. Pests, floods, wind, and drought have struck successively, leaving the land barren with nothing remaining. Grain prices have soared, and reserves are exhausted. Even wealthy households are on the verge of bankruptcy. The people are extremely distressed and displaced, with over 50,000 suffering from the disaster. With continuous rain and snow since winter for two months, wheat roots have rotted and the spring harvest is hopeless. Fishermen cannot fish, making livelihoods even more difficult. To this day, children are being sold, and people are fleeing. Seaweed and mountain herbs are being used as food. Some are even digging up sticky soil to prolong their lives, leading to digestive blockages and death from poisoning. The number of such cases is countless. Desperate famine victims are gathering in crowds, causing disturbances almost daily. The disaster area is vast, and the future is uncertain. If significant funds are not allocated promptly for relief, we fear that half of the 160,000 people will starve to death, and there will be no clean land in the 700 square li. We humbly request the immediate allocation of 100,000 yuan for spring relief and 20,000 sets of cotton clothing to save those who are groaning and waiting to die. Yuhuan County Chamber of Commerce Chairman Lin Wenhan and others respectfully kowtow." Also, the Yuhuan County Tonglin Lichun Committee reported: "Thousands of families in the Tonglin area and our village rely entirely on farming for a living. Unexpectedly, in June and July of last year, locusts and pests devoured everything, and strong winds and floods caused disasters one after another. The early and late rice crops planted were turned into weeds, resulting in no harvest of grain. From August to November, there was a prolonged drought with no rain, and the harvest of sweet potatoes, rice, and sweet potato vermicelli was less than 20%. This is a famine year unlike any in ancient times. Moreover, our area is inherently poor, leading to starvation and cold, with people hanging themselves, drowning themselves, and dying of illness due to starvation. All sorts of things have happened. Previously, we received 500 yuan from the provincial government for emergency relief, temporarily alleviating the immediate crisis, but it was only a drop in the bucket, unable to cover the entire area. Currently, our area and our village are about to run out of food, with no way to make a living. We will inevitably face starvation and death everywhere, a heartbreaking and tragic sight beyond words. We humbly request you to make every effort to convert funds into rice and quickly send it to our area to feed the starving people, so that there will be no more starvation and suicides. All of this will be your act of re-creation. Yuhuan County Tonglin District Poor People's Representative Gan Wufu and others."</p>

<h3 id="e170">News Report Editor Xu Yusun Dies Tragically <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Plight of Newspaper Reporters</p>
<p>Unable to Return Home Before Late at Night</p>
<p>Xu Yusun Meets Tragic End in Robbery</p>
<p>Shot Once, Giving His Life</p>
<p>At approximately 12 a.m. yesterday, Xu Yusun, a native of Zhenjiang and economic news editor at the News Report newspaper, was robbed and fatally shot while walking on Route Paul Brunat (now Huaihai Road) in the French Concession, inside the Sanyi Lane. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Brief Biography of the Xu Family: Xu Yusun was 33 years old, originally from the Shunjangzhou area across from Dagang Town, Zhenjiang. His family had moved to Shanghai years ago. His father, Wei Liu, was in the lumber business and passed away ten years ago. His mother, Zhang, is currently sixty years old. His wife, Chen, is the same age as him. He has four siblings; he is the second eldest. His elder brother, Fansun, is already over forty and works as a clerk at the Banking Association at No. 4 Hong Kong Road. His third brother, Shuchu, is 21 years old, and his fourth brother, Fuchu, is 19. Both are currently students at the Yucai School at the Datongmen in the southern part of the city. During the day, Xu worked as an editor for the Banking Weekly at No. 4 Hong Kong Road and also served as a secretary in the office of the President of the Central Bank. He went to the News Report newspaper to work in the evenings, working tirelessly with hardly any time for rest. He had three sons: the eldest, Zengdi, is 12 years old; the second, Yingkui, is 7 years old; and the youngest, Zengyi, is only 3 years old. Xu initially studied at the Nantong Textile Institute and later graduated from the Nanyang Commercial College in Shanghai. He had reportedly worked at the News Report newspaper for nine years.</p>
<p>Death During Robbery on the Way Home: The Xu family resides at No. 23 Tingyun Lane on Route Francis Garnier (now Kangping Road) in the French Concession. His elder brother, Fansun, rents part of No. 22 next door to live separately because the family home is small and crowded. Xu returned home from the newspaper office every day no earlier than midnight. The day before the incident, when Xu left home, he told his mother that he planned to return home early, no later than midnight. That evening, at approximately 11 p.m., Xu finished his work and started home. However, while walking inside Sanyi Lane on Route Paul Brunat in the French Concession, less than a few paces from his back door, several robbers suddenly rushed out from the darkness and stopped him to rob him. At the time, the robbers had already stripped off his black cat fur coat and mandarin jacket and were about to flee the lane when Xu shouted for help. The robbers then turned back and shot at Xu. One bullet struck his left flank, piercing through to his right back, and he immediately fell to the ground and died. The robbers fled in the chaos. However, no one heard the alarm at the time. It wasn't until 12:30 a.m., when the doorman of Sanyi Lane went out to close the iron gate at the entrance of the lane, that he noticed the body. However, he did not recognize Xu, so he immediately reported it to the police station.</p>
<p>Body Taken to Hall for Examination: After receiving the report, the police chief immediately ordered detectives to investigate. They found a bullet casing in the lane. The deceased was found wearing a short jacket, cotton trousers, leather shoes, and a felt hat, with nothing else on him. Later, several cards were found in the lane. The patrolman was about to take the cards, which had occupations, names, and addresses on them, to Tingyun Lane to inquire, when at the same time, Xu's mother was leaning against her pillow, hoping for her beloved son to return, as he was late. Suddenly, she heard a commotion outside the door and knew something was wrong. She got up and went outside, only to see her beloved son lying stiff in a pool of blood. Xu's mother wept bitterly over the body, and all the family members gathered upon hearing the news. They helped Xu's mother back inside and took the body to the Tongren Fuyuantang coroner's office. Yesterday, the Criminal Division of the police station ordered detectives to notify the deceased's brother, Xu Fansun, to come to the office to report the case. Judge Zhu of the French Court arrived at the office at 3 p.m. to conduct an examination. After the patrolman reported the details, Judge Zhu declared that the deceased had been fatally shot by robbers and that the family should be allowed to prepare a coffin and collect the body, pending the police's rigorous pursuit and investigation of the robbers. After the examination, Xu's third brother, Shuchu, hired undertakers to transport the body in a hearse to the Jingjiang Guild Hall in the Old West Gate for encoffining, and the body will be sent back to his hometown for burial on a selected date.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Huo Shouhua's Lawsuit Against Wen and Guo Ruled on Yesterday <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Wen and Guo Declared Not Guilty</p>
<p>Elements of Defamation Not Met</p>
<p>The Guangzhao Guild Hall's address on Ningbo Road in the International Settlement was leased by the guild hall to the Shanghai Bank to build a large building. However, Huo Shouhua, the chairman of the Guangdong Club, which was previously affiliated with the Guangzhao Guild Hall, and Wen Zongyao and Guo Biao, directors of the company, had disagreements over this issue. On December 24th of last year, the board of directors of the Guangzhao Guild Hall issued a leaflet announcing the situation to fellow villagers from the Guangzhao region residing in Shanghai. Huo Shouhua believed that the leaflet contained language that damaged his personal reputation. He hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution with the Provisional Court, requesting that Wen Zongyao (styled Qinpu) and Guo Biao be brought to court and punished according to Articles 324 and 325 of the Criminal Code, and that they be ordered to publish an apology in the newspaper. The case had already been heard once. Yesterday morning, Chief Justice Xu Jiashi opened the Seventh Court and summoned witnesses to continue the hearing. First, Luo Qin'san testified that the club had requested the guild hall to negotiate with the Shanghai Bank because the guild hall had leased the address to the Shanghai Bank to build a new building, and the contract did not specify a location for the guild hall's office or allow the guild hall's plaque to remain displayed. Therefore, a family reunion meeting was held to resolve this issue. Next, a witness surnamed Kuang testified that he attended the family reunion meeting as a guest and personally heard Huo Shouhua say that the club should supervise the guild hall. Huo immediately argued that he did not see this witness present at the time and did not know him. The two sides questioned each other and swore to the heavens. Later, Huo stated that his remarks at the time did not say that the Guangdong Club would supervise the Guangzhao Guild Hall. However, the leaflet issued by the defendant accused me of seizing and occupying, which is the behavior of local tyrants and bullies. If I, Huo, had such behavior, I would accept the punishment of a local tyrant. The defendant slandered me with such words, making it impossible for me to live in society. Therefore, I have no choice but to seek legal protection, and so on. Chief Justice presided. Next, the defendant Wen Zongyao testified that the leaflet said that Huo had the intention of seizing and occupying, and his letters of February 19th and March 1st revealed his intention to occupy. He wanted to stop the construction of the new building in order to stay in the old building for a long time. Wen also answered the plaintiff's lawyer's question, stating that the Shanghai Bank leased the land to the Guangzhao Guild Hall to build a building. The guild hall's board of directors appointed me, Chen Bingqian, Guo Biao, Guo Le, and others on August 24th of the year before last to negotiate with the Shanghai Bank. The agreement was reached on December 25th, and the contract was submitted to Chairman Tang Shaochuan for review. The board of directors then held a meeting to review the contract item by item. As a result of the discussion, the entire contract was passed. The bank now retains 5,200 square feet of land for the guild hall's use, but the bank is unwilling to lease it to the club for use as an office, and so on. Huang Hongjun, a director of the club, also testified and was critical of the contract between the company and the bank and sympathetic to Huo Shouhua's actions at the time. The witness Chen Bingqian also stated that Huo did say at the family reunion meeting that the club should supervise the guild hall. Finally, the lawyers for both sides began their arguments. The arguments ended at 2 p.m., and Chief Justice Xu then ruled that the defendants Wen Qinpu and Guo Biao were not guilty and announced the reasons for the ruling, stating that Wen Qinpu proposed at the board of directors meeting of the guild hall on December 24th that if the leaflet issued by the preparatory committee of the Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association was not clarified, fellow villagers from Guangzhao residing in Shanghai might have misunderstandings. The true situation of the land lease should be printed and announced so that fellow villagers would be aware. The purpose of issuing the notice was to defend and explain, not to spread the plaintiff's evil deeds to the public. Examining the contents of the notice, it is clear that it contains language debating right and wrong. The facts pointed out were merely that the plaintiff had requested to lease back the base for the Guangdong Club and was unsuccessful, and that he was obstructing the project out of resentment. The plaintiff was said to have contributed to the Guangdong Club, which shows that the plaintiff's protest was a matter of public concern and not an attempt to seize and occupy for personal gain. It cannot be said that the plaintiff's evil deeds and scandals, that is, the matters pointed out, are sufficient to affect the plaintiff's social standing and there is no risk of loss of reputation. The elements of the crime of defamation are not met, and the defendants are not guilty. Upon hearing the ruling, both parties left, and the case ended there.</p>
<h3 id="e172">French Municipal Council Accused <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Plaintiff: Sino-French Company</p>
<p>Consular Court Opens Trial</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, on December 30th, thieves broke into the Sino-French Company at No. 693 Xujiahui Road and stole part of the staff's wages, totaling 4,600 yuan. Afterward, the Sino-French Company accused the French Municipal Council of negligence of duty by the police and claimed that it could provide sufficient evidence. The French Consular Court summoned both parties and opened the trial on the 13th of this month. The plaintiff's lawyer, Mo Tiyi, first refuted the defendant's lawyer Ba He's argument that the Administrative Committee of the Municipal Council was not responsible for the actions of the police, stating that since there was no judicial police force in the concession, all the police officers should be considered municipal police officers, and the Municipal Council should be responsible for the police affairs it handles. If the court accepts this principle and responsibility, then he can easily prove the police's dereliction of duty based on the subsequent investigation, so the Sino-French Company should demand compensation, and so on. Lawyer Ba He argued that the Municipal Council only provided the necessary expenses for handling police affairs to several responsible personnel to handle police affairs and refuted the plaintiff's lawyer's points, saying that if the court accepts his principle, then the Municipal Council will be responsible for every petty theft that occurs in the concession. Subsequently, the lawyers on both sides displayed their eloquence and debated for a long time. The court then announced a recess and scheduled a date for the verdict. It is said that this type of case may still be the first time in the French Court, so its outcome is of great concern to all parties.</p>

<p>The birth of Gao Liao at the Suzhou High Court detention center was reported in the previous newspaper. News has now been received from her relatives in Shanghai that she is ill in the detention center. Also, because she was seven months pregnant, she fell and injured herself, causing a premature birth. Her condition is quite critical, and a certain doctor saved her. After childbirth, her body became weaker, and her lung disease recurred. The doctor ordered her to be moved to a hospital, so she immediately appealed for bail. She was granted bail for a deposit of 10,000 yuan. She has been raising money for many days but has not been able to reach the full amount, so she appealed again for a reduction, asking to pay a 3,000 yuan deposit with a shop as guarantor.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Spring Grazing of Sheep Hinders Farming <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Wusong City Committee Petitions for Issuance of Proclamation Banning</p>
<p>In the Bao Shan County territory, it has been the custom that, every spring, the county government issues a proclamation to all county residents banning sheep grazing to avoid damage to crops. Violators will be severely punished according to law. Therefore, farmers in the county invariably transport their livestock to other counties to sell during this period, and the value of sheep is therefore lower than usual. This spring, the Bao Shan County government again issued a proclamation banning sheep grazing as usual. Because Wusong was incorporated into the special municipality, the farmers of Tui 34, Tui 35, Teng 40, Teng 41, and other villages bordering Bao Shan County all coveted the cheap price of sheep, which was profitable, and because the municipal government had no clear ban on sheep, eight or nine out of ten people invested in purchasing sheep from places like Yang Hang in Bao Shan for raising. They disregarded public morality and arbitrarily formed groups to graze in the fields, causing great damage to crops. Liu Ziwen, a member of the Wusong Municipal Government Committee, after receiving reports from the local bailiffs and farmers of the various villages for the past two days, immediately sent personnel to investigate the sheep raised by farming families in the countryside. There were as many as five or six thousand sheep. At this early spring time, the crops are just budding, and if they are allowed to trample and gnaw, it will not only hinder the spring harvest, but the autumn harvest will also be greatly affected. Moreover, this situation is not unique to the Wusong district. It is assumed that the situation is largely the same in other rural districts of the city, which is of great importance to the future of agriculture. Therefore, yesterday, the Social Bureau of the Municipal Government was presented with the situation and requested that the Municipal Government immediately issue a proclamation banning farmers from grazing sheep in the spring, following the precedent of the Bao Shan County government, so as not to hinder agriculture.</p>

<p>Recently, Leng, the magistrate of Shanghai County, ordered that, since exposed coffins and corpses were everywhere in the county, and that some had not been buried for many years, which was detrimental to hygiene, the district chiefs were instructed to bury all exposed coffins and corpses, regardless of whether they had owners or not, before Arbor Day. The funds required, set at 100 yuan per district, have been officially notified to the property office to be allocated under the charity item.</p>

However, smallpox has suddenly become rampant along the Pudong coast, with many children suffering. The police station and Pudong Hospital are constantly visited by those seeking treatment, and there are not a few who die. There are as many as seven or eight small coffins for children in front of the Pudong Hospital every month.</p>

Her father, Dai Xuelian, sold Dai Zhenru to a brothel opened by Li Bin in Qugang, Rugao, as a prostitute due to economic pressure. From then on, she fell into the pit of fire, and her business was quite bad. The pimp also relied on her as a cash cow. Recently, Zhenru received a guest named Gu Lanbo, who was a member of the 8th District of the Qugang Public Security Bureau. He was young and heroic and fell in love at first sight. Thus, when Gu was off duty, he often lingered in the brothel. As a result, they made vows of love and marriage. Zhenru requested to leave the brothel, and Gu discussed it with the pimp. However, the pimp deliberately raised the price, and Gu's funds were insufficient, causing the matter to stall. On the 1st of this month, Gu went to Yaojia Stone Bridge in Shanghai to visit his uncle. On the 8th, he did not go to Zhenru's place. Zhenru, with eyes worn with longing, asked Gu's servant, Wu Jinchen, who said that Gu had gone to Shanghai. Zhenru then begged Wu to take her to Shanghai on the 10th of this month to meet Gu and live together in love. However, after losing Zhenru, the pimp sent people to search everywhere. He San, a pimp hired by Li Bin, saw Zhenru passing by Qiujiang Road in Zhabei in a rickshaw the day before yesterday. He San pulled Zhenru out of the rickshaw and reported it to the police at the 2nd Sub-station of the 5th District. After questioning and clarifying the details, Gu Lanbo was also detained. Yesterday, they were both presented to the Judicial Section and transferred to the District Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Conclusion of Trial for Husband's Murder by Mercury-Laced Rice <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Landlady Inevitably Suspected of Abetting</p>
<p>Last year, a foreign resident, Hou Yanji, was poisoned by his concubine, Hou Li, who mixed mercury into his rice in an attempt to murder him. Hou noticed something was wrong and shouted for help. The police sent Hou to the hospital for treatment. Because he did not ingest much, he was able to recover. Hou Li and the involved landlady, Li Wei, were detained and sent to the District Court for interrogation. It is now learned that the Procuratorate has completed its investigation and determined that Hou Li and Li Wei, who abetted her, were guilty of murder under Article 284, Section 1 and Section 2 of the Criminal Code, and have filed a public prosecution. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian opened a court to hear the case. Hou Yanji testified that on the afternoon of January 19th, at 3 p.m., his wife, Hou Li, called him home for dinner. Because he was ill and had a poor appetite, he complained that there was a lack of soup, and it was difficult to swallow the dry rice. At that time, the landlady, Li Wei, said that it would be better to use vegetable soup to mix the rice, which would be easier to swallow than dry rice. However, when he was about to finish eating, mercury appeared at the bottom of the bowl, and he realized that there was poison in the rice, which was why the taste was different from usual. He shouted for help in terror, and the police sent him to the hospital for treatment and saved his life. He asked for an investigation, and so on. After obtaining the testimony, the judge ordered the imprisoned Hou Li and Li Wei to be brought to the case. First, Hou Li testified that she had been having an affair with Hou Yanji for seven years. This time, she tried to murder her husband with mercury at the instigation of the landlady, Li Wei, who repeatedly urged her to buy mercury. She was confused for a moment and bought three packets of mercury and took them home. At about 3 p.m. that afternoon, her husband, Hou Yanji, was drinking tea in a teahouse. Li Wei urged her to call her husband back for dinner. She mixed two packets of mercury into the rice, and Li Wei helped her mix the other packet into the rice. Fortunately, it was noticed immediately and he was sent to the hospital, so he did not die. This fact was instigated by Li Wei, and so on. The judge asked, "Did Li Wei benefit from ordering you to murder your husband?" She replied, "Li Wei told me that after Hou was murdered, she would let me eat at her house and think of another way," and so on. Li Wei vehemently denied this. The judge asked, "Do you have any grudges against Li?" She replied, "No." The judge said, "Since there are no grudges, there is no reason for her to implicate you." Li Wei testified that this matter was entirely initiated by Hou Li alone, who wanted to murder her husband. She repeatedly discussed it with me in secret. I said that human life is at stake, so how could I do such a thing? Where is your conscience? However, she was determined to murder her husband, and I could not stop her. The judge asked, "Why didn't you provide this kind of testimony earlier? It is obvious that you participated in the murder plan. Even if Hou Li is implicating you out of resentment, then why did she admit that she went to buy the mercury alone and did not say that you went with her? She also said that she put two packets into the rice, saying that you only put in one packet. Judging from this, Hou Li's testimony is correct." At this point, the judge ordered prosecutor Zhu to come to the court to present the prosecution's intentions and requested that the designated lawyer Zhou Yu defend the two defendants. The judge then declared that the arguments in this case were over and awaited sentencing. The two defendants, Hou Li and Li Wei, were returned to custody, and Hou Yanji was dismissed.</p>

<p>Zheng Jinshan, a native of Funing, who lives at No. 7 Yishen Lane, Yaojia Stone Bridge, Zhabei, yesterday brought Zhang Wang, with whom he lives, to the 4th District General Office to complain, saying that he used to farm in his hometown. Later, he heard that life in Shanghai was comfortable and easy to make money, so he led his wife, Yang, to Shanghai on the 14th day of the twelfth lunar month of the previous year. He asked his wife to work in a silk factory, and he also worked as a laborer. The monthly income of the two of them was enough to make a living, and the family was happy. However, his wife was led astray by Wang, who lived with them, and suddenly liked to wear heavy makeup and fancy clothes. She secretly cut off her Lizhi hair and often went to amusement parks or movie theaters. The feelings between the couple, which were once strong, are now often strained, like strangers. A few days ago, she was led out for fun by Wang three times in a row and given a fur coat. However, on the 14th of this month, she disappeared. He has no relatives in Shanghai. Judging from the situation, she must have been abducted by Wang. Therefore, he brought her to the office to ask for an investigation. When questioned, Wang, 35 years old, said that she was from the same hometown as the plaintiff and lived with him. His wife came to Shanghai for the first time and had little experience. She often invited me to go out, and I could not refuse, so I accompanied her out twice. A few days ago, the plaintiff and his wife had an argument and said that he wanted to sell her. She was very angry and sobbed for a long time. (At that time, she said to me, "I (referring to the plaintiff's wife) don't want to live in this world anymore." I comforted her, but I didn't expect her to disappear the next day. So the disappearance of his wife is not my fault. As for saying that I gave her a fur coat, you don't know that I can barely feed myself, so where would I get the money to make clothes for her? All the accusations are unfounded. Please investigate." Director Jin thought that the statements of both parties were conflicting, but the case involved criminal prosecution, so he ordered them to be sent to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Examination of Young Girl's Corpse <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Doctor Proves Lung Disease</p>
<p>Official Orders Re-Examination After Autopsy</p>
<p>A young girl's corpse was found on the riverbank behind the Rui Rong Shipyard in Yangshupu. It has been examined by the Provisional Court, and the Huishan Police Station has found the deceased's father, Ding Huibiao, and sent him to the court for questioning. He was ordered to be detained temporarily for an autopsy and re-examination, and the details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Judge Sun Yuan arrived at the coroner's office on Ferry Road at 11 a.m. yesterday and opened a court to hear the case. The deputy police chief of the Huishan Police Station, Hui Ke, reported the details and summoned two witnesses to testify. According to Chinese doctor Guan Nanchun, the deceased lived in Huixing Lane, Tao Peng Road, and suffered from lung disease. I treated her four times, and the phlegm had become pus, which was a fatal disease. According to Yang Ren, who lived with her, the deceased's parents lived downstairs, and I lived in the loft they built. The deceased had been suffering from the disease for a long time. I don't know how she was carried out after her death, because it was at night and I was asleep, so I didn't see anything. When questioned, Ding Huibiao testified that his daughter, Xiao Kouzi, had lung disease. She was treated in Jiangbei in various ways, and she was treated several times after coming to Shanghai, but the treatment was ineffective and she died. Because four children have died in a row, and we fled to Shanghai from Jiangbei because of famine, we had no money to buy a coffin, so we hired a rickshaw to dump the corpse. The cotton and flowers stuffed in her mouth were because we were afraid that the lung disease would spread through her breath after death, so we stuffed cotton in. Please understand. Judge Sun received the report and stated that although Ding Xiao Kouzi's corpse had been autopsied by a doctor, the autopsy report had not yet been received. Ding Huibiao was ordered to remain temporarily detained at the police station, and the matter will be re-examined next Monday.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Small Cargo Ships Gather to Protest Inspection and Are Expelled <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>All types of boats in the city, except for punts and rowboats, which are simply constructed, have complex demographics among the boatmen, and have no legitimate business, have long been criticized by passengers on the Huangpu River. Therefore, the Municipal Government has decided to ban these boats that hinder traffic and has stipulated that no donations or taxes will be levied to limit their number, in order to seek a fundamental solution. In addition, boats with legitimate businesses should pay donations separately according to the prescribed grades, which goes without saying. However, small cargo ships carrying rice have completely different areas, tonnage, construction, and business nature from so-called punts. Now, someone is stirring up trouble, trying to cite the precedent of rowboats and demanding exemption from donations. They gathered at the Dongjiadu Wharf to protest the inspection and forced the same type of boats that had already registered and paid donations (about sixty ships) to join the commotion. It was found that the Dongjiadu Wharf is very important to traffic because of the Shangnan Ferry, Luli Bridge Ferry, and other ferries, where passengers get on and off. The passengers of the Luli Bridge Ferry almost fell into the Huangpu River because of this. The Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau believed that the actions of small cargo ships, etc., were detrimental to traffic. In order to maintain order on the water and protect the safety of travelers, they had to be expelled. The boatmen then dispersed.</p>

<p>Suddenly Returns to Bao Shan to Surrender Himself</p>
<p>The escape of thief Yin Zhengzhong from the Bao Shan County Prison, and the simultaneous disappearance of guard Wu Dengjia, who was monitoring the prisoner, etc., were reported in the previous newspaper. It is now learned that the guard Wu suddenly returned to Bao Shan yesterday morning to surrender himself. County Magistrate Wu Jianong sent hearing officer Zhang to open a court at 1 p.m. to interrogate him. According to Wu, the thief Yin Zhengzhong asked the head guard Liu Jingren for leave to go out that day, and Liu ordered me to accompany him to monitor him. After leaving the prison, we took a car to Shanghai and stayed overnight at the Wang family, relatives of the prisoner Yin, in Tanzi Bay. The next day, we got up and went to Yin's house. In the afternoon, Yin wanted to go out again, and I followed behind him. However, after walking about half a mile, five or six people wearing short clothes suddenly came up and stopped me. At this time, the prisoner Yin took the opportunity to escape, and they all dispersed in a crowd. After the incident, I dared not return immediately. I lingered in Shanghai for several days, begging for forgiveness, and so on. According to Liu Jingren, he only allowed him to ask for leave to go out to buy things and did not allow the prisoner to go to Shanghai. After verifying the statements, the hearing officer Zhang believed that Liu and Wu should not have neglected their duties and ordered them to be returned to custody, pending investigation.</p>

<p>At the Shanghai South Railway Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, yesterday at 7:30 AM, a passenger arrived by rickshaw to purchase a ticket. Hu Yiqian, an investigator dispatched by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to the South Station to inspect passengers, along with Senior Inspector Gao and others, found his demeanor suspicious. Upon inspection, they discovered four ounces of opium hidden in the passenger's crotch. A police officer took the passenger to the Second District Police Station at Gaochang Temple. Unexpectedly, upon realizing the opium was confiscated, the passenger attempted to stab himself under the police officer's electric baton, but was fortunately restrained. After a brief interrogation by Police Officer Niu at the station, he identified himself as Xu Shiyong, 45 years old, from Taizhou. He claimed the opium was for his own consumption. Subsequently, Police Officer Niu prepared a document and escorted both the suspect and the evidence to the Second District Headquarters for further investigation.</p>

<p>Two Zhang Yueyues Emerge</p>
<p>Dispute Over Zhang Haisheng's Inheritance</p>
<p>Zhang Haisheng, a local resident of Yangjiazhai in Pudong, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Local Court against his elder sister, Zhang A'da, accusing her of illegally occupying the inheritance and requesting its division. After repeated summons, Zhang A'da raised the issue of debt, claiming that after their parents' death, they lacked funds for the funeral and had borrowed 300 yuan from Zhang Yueyue, which now needed to be repaid. Rights and obligations should be equally distributed. The court thus summoned Zhang Yueyue to testify. Zhang Haisheng immediately denounced the person appearing in court as not the real Zhang Yueyue, stating that the other Zhang Yueyue was a female worker at the British American Tobacco factory. The questioning official concluded that this Zhang Yueyue was not the genuine one and was impersonating the real one. Therefore, she was sent to the Prosecutor's Office to investigate her perjury. This Zhang Yueyue defended herself by stating that her real name was indeed Zhang Yueyue, and that there was another Zhang Yueyue who was a foreman. Thus, the double Zhang Yueyue case emerged. The prosecutor ordered her to be released on bail pending investigation. Yesterday, an order was issued to summon both Zhang Yueyues for questioning to determine the truth of the matter. Unexpectedly, Zhang A'da also went to the Prosecutor's Office to file a complaint, alleging that she had been beaten by her younger brother and uncle and pushed into a river, highlighting the unending legal disputes between siblings.</p>

<p>The ten-year-old daughter of a Russian woman named Baisha Weiqi, residing on Rue de l'Immaculée Conception in the French Concession, was accompanied by her nanny, Zhang, to school on Hualong Road on November 14 of last year. Unexpectedly, while walking near Huanlong Road, she was struck and injured by a private car driven by Fang Yulong, residing on Dalianwan Road. She was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday, the plaintiff's lawyer, Yan Pulai Mei, filed a lawsuit in the French Court, stating that the plaintiff's daughter had been seriously injured by the defendant's car and was still in the hospital. The circumstances of the accident were witnessed and could be proven. Subsequently, a Westerner, Mr. A, testified in court, confirming everything. The defendant, Fang Yulong, stated that on that day, a merchant's car was traveling from east to west at a speed of only fifteen yards. The plaintiff's daughter and another child suddenly rushed out of a small alley from north to south and bumped into the rear wheel of the merchant's car. Upon noticing, he immediately stopped the car and sent the child to the plaintiff's home. At that time, the merchant observed that the child's foot was only slightly injured.

<p>Death After Falling Down, the day before yesterday, an unidentified man, approximately 40 years old, suddenly fell to the ground and died in the Yukang Lane of Rue P. Fesson in the French Concession. The police, upon discovering the body, reported it to the police station and ordered detectives to investigate. The deceased was wearing a dark blue silk cotton robe, a dark blue Western silk jacket, a gray Saxon cloth lining, a cotton-padded jacket and trousers, a willow-patterned cloth shirt, and white flannel trousers. He wore an old black velvet hat and straight-lined woolen shoes with white cotton socks. He appeared to have died from illness.

The detectives reported back to the police chief, who had the body taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to confirm the cause of death. Yesterday, the Criminal Division of the French Police Station reported to Judge Zhu, who confirmed that the deceased had died of illness. He ordered that the body be photographed and stored by the hall, awaiting family members to claim it.</p>
<p>Death by Coal Gas Poisoning, Shao Li, a Ningbo housewife residing at No. 14 Huaji Road in Hongkou, shared a pavilion room upstairs with her granddaughter Shao Xiuzhen and maid Zhu Jiang. On the night of the 14th, due to the cold, they had a coal briquette stove, which they did not extinguish when they went to sleep. On the afternoon of the 15th, none of them woke up.

<h3 id="e192">Merchants' Association Requests Permission for Street Vendor Association to Organize <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The Merchants' Association submitted a report to the Central Party Headquarters yesterday regarding the organization of a trade association for street vendors. (Above omitted) The case originated from a letter from the Vegetable Stall Industry Branch on the 12th of this month, stating: "We have read in the newspaper that the Central Executive Committee has issued instructions to party headquarters in various provinces and cities, as well as a news item stating that the new Chamber of Commerce Law and the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law have been officially promulgated by the government. From now on, the organization of merchant groups should be carried out in accordance with the newly promulgated laws and regulations. Members of the original merchant associations, except for street vendors who are mobile and do not need to organize a group, are naturally included in the Chamber of Commerce and the Trade Association. We do not know if this is true. Our branch was originally composed of street vendors and is naturally included in the street vendor category. However, we have found that most street vendors in various places do not have a fixed base. Their mobile nature is self-evident. However, the situation of street vendors in Shanghai Special Municipality is different. Street vendors must report to the Public Security Bureau to designate a location, assign a number, and pay a license fee to the Finance Bureau. They are not allowed to move without permission. The same is true in the concessions, where the police handle it in the same way. Therefore, their nature is different from that of other street vendors and those in other places. They are not mobile. May we request your observation and submission to the Central Government, approving that the Vegetable Stall Industry in Shanghai Special Municipality, like small and medium-sized merchants, should still be allowed to establish an association for the purpose of judgment, etc." Upon investigation, the letter states that street vendors in this city must report to the bureau to designate a location, assign a number, and pay a license fee, and that after the number is assigned, they cannot move without permission. It can be verified that there are official records in the government offices. In its recent report to the Executive Yuan, the municipal government also stated this point and did not make it up. The claim that their nature is not mobile and that the situation is different from that in other places is reasonable. Street vendors belong to the category of small merchants. The general rules for merchants have clear provisions, but restricting their right to unite and defend themselves seems to be contrary to the principle of equality for all in national politics. According to the previous letter, the branch association resolved at the 37th standing committee meeting to submit it to the Central Government for review and approval. We hereby submit this document to your department for review and approval and request that you issue instructions for compliance. (Below omitted)</p>

<h3 id="e211">News from the World of Painting and Calligraphy <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>The painter Lü Gongwang has returned to Shanghai from Huzhou. Mr. Lü Wang of Beiping has calligraphy that is vigorous and powerful, and has long been highly praised. He originally planned to increase his fees in the Gengwu year to benefit the poor, but in the new year, he was invited by a friend in Huzhou to write inscriptions for plaques. He only returned yesterday. He had already accumulated many written pieces last year, and this has further increased the backlog. It is difficult to increase the fees now, so he will temporarily maintain the original example from the Yi Si year and revise them in the summer. Those who admire him should take note of this. The general receiving address remains at No. 129, intersection of Ximen Road and Bai'er Road.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Collection of Childlike Hearts <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>I remember that last summer, the elementary school of the Patriotic Girls' School published a collection called "Childlike Hearts," which was very well received by readers. They originally planned to publish second, third, and more collections, but the training instructor, Guo Licen, accepted an invitation from Suzhou Girls' Middle School and Elementary School, and thus Mr. Guo left the Patriotic Girls' School to work at the Suzhou school. After graduation, most of the young writers dispersed, with about two-thirds remaining to continue their studies in the middle school of the Patriotic Girls' School. Although they were scattered like swallows and petrels, their spirit of unity remained the same, and they continued to work tirelessly in the arts. The enthusiasm for the first collection was already surging and boiling in their minds. Even outside readers often sent letters to inquire, showing that those who had read it were extremely concerned. The motivation for the second collection was their fuse. It is said that they already have a complete plan and are currently preparing various manuscripts, with Mr. Guo Licen still responsible for editing, and the second collection will be published in the near future.
