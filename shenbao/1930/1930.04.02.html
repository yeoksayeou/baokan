<h3 id="c3">愛爾蘭之運動 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>英國附屬地之最大者。在亞洲爲印度。在歐洲爲愛爾蘭。今印度人民之獨立運動。正在以非武力抵抗求達目的。而愛爾蘭之獨立運動。似亦仍在繼續進行中。此次國民黨領袖伐勒拉氏。在美迭有表示。一則謂回國後决意改組新政府。誓將完成其向所懷抱愛爾蘭獨立之主張。再則謂。本黨果能如願執政。則將宣布政策。造成愛爾蘭之統一與獨立共和。查愛爾蘭之國民黨。在國會中勢力。本不亞於政府黨。若再聯合一二同情之政黨。必能占議席多數。故伐氏所抱完成獨立之志願。亦並非可望而不可即者也。</p>
<p>自一九二一年英愛簽定和約後。南愛爾蘭即已脫離聯合王國而造成自由邦。自由邦在不列顚帝國中所處地位。與加拿大相同。僅爲一種自治領域。雖其行政會議主席由國會選舉。（即大總統）但仍屬英帝國統治之下。於軍事上經濟上。並須盡種種義務。因是愛人認爲未能滿意。近因工業不振。財政不易整理。失業與移民等問題。無法解决。於是益觸動其完成獨立之念。而覺進行運動之不可稍緩。其最大目的。在要求恢復愛爾蘭國語。藉以鼓勵愛爾蘭人民愛國之决心。蓋亦在民族運動勃發之潮流中必至之現象也。</p>
<p>自民族運動紛起以後。吾觀各國政府所取應付之態度。以英國最爲寛大和緩。如此次印度之非武力抵抗。僅將某市長拘禁十日。其餘義務員未捕一人。説者謂寛大和緩。適以引起其他殖民自治地獨立之欲望。殊不知在此時代中。愈嚴厲即愈激起其奮發之心。糾紛恐將愈甚。此種大勢所趨之問題。豈手叚所能消弭也哉。</p>

<p>民族體格强健</p>
<p>完成國民革命</p>
<p>中央黨部代表邵元冲致訓詞、略謂中國幾千年來、祇講文字、對於國民體魄、民族精神、毫不注意、所以每逢外力來壓迫、往往不能抵抗、近年西方白種人、運用其科學精神、中華民族處處表現其弱點、因此總理提倡國民革命、不但恢復固有的文化道德、同時恢復固有的能力、民族的精神、將中華民族體格强健起來、完成國民革命、此次全國運動大會經過長時間籌備、能於今天舉行、倘使一般國民、能個個認識這次大會的使命、國家就有希望了、近代國家國民、完全以知識能力相競爭、根本要有强健體力、才可以將文化道德民族精神振作起來、並且運動要普遍於全民、社會能整個强健、才能達到在世界上爲最優的民族、而能創造新文化、以發展國性、希望全體運動員、認識這重大的責任、</p>

<p>全國運動會係擁護中央的表示</p>
<p>演説畢羣衆歡呼萬歲四聲</p>
<p>蔣主席略謂、中華民國全國運動大會全體會員會長、今天我們在此地舉行全國運動大會、他的意義及使命、現在要向諸位報告一下、我們中華民族、在世界上是開化最早的、人口有四萬萬之多、在世界上又占第一位置、土地又很廣大、但是我們的國家、在世界上的地位、在國際上的地位、又是占着怎樣一個位置呢、説起來是極其恥辱的、可是這種奇恥大辱、又從怎樣來的呢、是帝國主義者用種種方法、壓迫我們所致、這一次全國運動大會、就是我們中華民族對於帝國主義示威的表示、是一種獨立精神的表示、也是對於國内一切軍閥反動勢力的表示、這一次大會、是集全國最優秀最强健的國民於一塲、换句話講、就是對於中央政府、表示一致的擁護、所以這一次大會的意義、不單是發揚國民的體格、也是對於帝國主義軍閥反動勢力表示示威、以完成國民革命、建設三民主義的國家、來洗刷從前一切的國恥、今天代表國民政府歡迎各省市運動員、從今天起、希望本着大會的使命、繼續不斷的努力、蔣主席致詞畢、呼全國運動大會萬歲、中國國民黨萬歲、中華民國萬歲、全塲呼蔣主席萬歲、</p>

<p>總代表袁禮敦致詞謂、今天是中國空前之全運開幕日、兄弟代表參加各單位向中央國民政府會長各方代表表示謝忱、此次全運大會開會、承中央及各方代表參加、給我們許多敎訓、除我們各人自己振刷精神之外、更謝中央訓詞、不但我們此次要奮發、離開後也不斷提倡體育、我們參加單位到杭州、見設備之周、招待之殷、實異常榮感、代表向籌備諸君道謝、此次在杭州開會、杭是全國勝地、得參加之餘、流連山水、體力得修養、感謝提議杭運、更感謝帮忙諸先生、因爲此次中央如此提倡、設備如此週到、地方如此優美、覺得非常快慰奮發、我們希望此會完後、體育得從此發達、精神得普遍健康、希望中央督促、自己還加努力、</p>

<p>全會係强健民族的最好方法</p>
<p>各省市全體運動員宣誓之後、國民政府主席蔣介石氏再致訓詞、略以各位運動員同志、方才兄弟所講的話、恐怕爲風勢過大、不甚清晰、爲了十二分的佩服、所以還要再對各位運動員各位同志講幾句話、此次全國運動會舉行的意義、各位都已很明瞭、而中央對於全國運動會的希望尤大、因爲黨國基礎爲民族、民族不强、則外侮侵漸、全國運動會、是强健民族的最好方法、從此次神户·遼寗等各路途遠駌之區、竟能如期趕到參加運動、此種精神、良可敬佩、但在最近帝國主義侵略情形之下、與軍閥封建思想壓迫之下、極希望以此次參加之精神、强健我們的身體、大家起來奮鬥云云、</p>

<p>我們要做已開化的國民</p>
<p>吴氏略謂今天集全國選手於一地、開這樣盛大的運動會、是極不容易的一回事、本來國家的强弱、完全根據於國民的體格强弱與否、有了强健之民族、然後才有强健之國家、我們人數的進化、已有了幾萬年的歷史、我們中國人不但體格方面没有進化、連原有的體格、及漸漸地退化下去、以致外國人以東西病夫這名字、加在我國國民身上、希望諸位選手、從今天以後、努力奮鬥、做一個已開化民族的國民、</p>

<p>大會是表演全國統一的精神</p>
<p>希望出席遠東會得最後勝利</p>
<p>大致謂各位選手已聽了許多重要的演説了、我也不必多講、不過我在這次的運動會中、看見這許多選手、覺得非常之高興、此次運動大會是靜江先生發起的、各省代表及國外僑胞、都前來參加所以蔣主席説、全國運動會可算是表現全國統一的精神、五月間遠東運動大會、又要到日本去舉行了、所以這次大會、又可算是遠東大會預備會、更希望到日本去的諸位選手、爲祖國爭光得最後勝利、發揚我民族精神、</p>

<p>褚氏謂今天參加全國運動會、精神非常之快樂、因這次全國運動會、是國府統一以後的第一次大會、兄弟前後參加過不少的全省運動會、覺得精神和設備、總不如這次的盡善、這次全國運動、是靜江先生發起的、目的在激發固有的體育、惟體育應時時注意、一主面要競賽、一方面要多注意平時練習、單在競賽時注意、是不好的現象、希望以後每年皆有很大的運動會、使得體育普及、人民的體格由弱而强、</p>

<p>天津隊以勇猛之前鋒向安徽進攻左右兩内锋均活潑異常、安徽隊則一盤散沙踼出之球大多無的放矢、故始終被津隊包圍、絶無進展之機會比賽亦因此毫無精采可言</p>

<p>開賽後津隊前鋒即猛攻安徽球門、津隊白安興、帶球傳中、中鋒張長裕射門被擋出、奈四面包圍卒被左内鋒孫桂林打進安徽受此重創力圖恢復、然實力究竟不足、未生效率、其後津隊左翼白慶國盤球如入無人之境舉足射門、球爲張長裕所得再傳與孫桂林輕輕一脚又應聲入網以後安徽隊陣勢更凌亂最後又被津隊孫桂林連續射兩球、上半時四與零、天津勝、</p>

<p>休息五分鐘再行續戰、開戰未幾、孫桂林盤球直入、又進一球、時距開賽僅兩分鐘耳、此時安徽隊軍心更搖動每有絶好機會均失之交臂以後球常在安徽隊門前、鮮有過半道線者、安徽隊球門、遂成衆午之時、梁建文又得中鋒及右翼之接濟、射進二球、第八第九兩球均爲中鋒張長裕射進俄而銀笛聲起、比賽遂告終結、</p>

<p>擇方旣定、浙先發球、未曾得分、天津首次發球即連得五分、聲勢赫赫、旋浙亦努力進攻、成二與五之比、然卒以實力相差懸殊、殊難與抗、迨津隊以十一比五佔優調方以後、氣勢愈盛、未幾即以二十一比五勝第一局、第二局中、浙隊仍一蹶不振又以四比二十一失敗、津隊旣連勝二局、遂取得次賽權云、兩隊陣綫列後、裁判員李飛雲、</p>

<p>衣此屆全國運動大會、四方健兒、會聚一堂、洵爲一時盛况、各選手平時所御衣服、五顏六色、至爲可觀、其間除大部分均着普通之運重服外、如遼寗之女選手、頭帶紫羅蘭色運動帽、上身紫醬色藍邊絨衫、玄色嗶嘰衫褲、北平女選手上身黑色紅邊絨衫、黑色衫褲、青島女選手、藍色布衫藍布裙、男選手黄色絨衫白褲、河北男選手紅色絨衫白褲湖北女選手藍色衫褲、均配色匀整、十分漂亮、大槪各地衣服之顏色、華北方面、非常鮮艶、華中方面如湘豫鄂赣等處之選手、衣服則十分樸素、於此一端、亦足見國内地衣服色彩之心理也、</p>
<p>食大會選手曁職員、都至三千餘人、吃的問題、至爲重要、大會乃向報事火頭軍之包飯作、訂定條約、每日中膳在十二時、下午在六時、同時開飯、不得延誤、以謀時間之便利、並規定運動員每桌八人、四盤兩碗一湯、每客大洋兩角、職員則六碗一湯、每桌六人、每客小洋兩角、但大會如同時開飯、塲内又無若是之廣廳、可供大啖之需、於是乃搭一大棚廠、計闊十一間、深二十間、列桌二百四十、條凳九百六十、同時開飯、盤碗交響、如此大飯廳「蔚爲大觀」四字、足以當之、在始吃飯問題之間、日昨北方選手竟發生異議、以北主嗜麵、對於白米飯、殊難下咽、大會方面亦以南北習慣这各異、故於北主健兒、則每餐之白米飯、均改爲麵包大饅頭矣、</p>

<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>（一）十二小時内地震八十次　頃據日本通訊。謂近在阿塔迷At2mi及矮子半島　Izn　Ｐen附近。地震極多而烈。除爲居民所。察得者外。在天文台之地震計上所探得者。在最近三星期中。已及七百餘次之多。其中以上星期一一日爲最甚。平均每日自日落至日殁之間。至少有八十次之地震。日本各地。素以擅於地震著稱。然如此次次數之多。實覺少見。然當局者則頗以此爲幸。因小地震多則可免激烈之大地震也。重建東京之事業方成。深望在此地震聲中。忽再遇大地震如數年前之東京也。該地居民。日處於恐慌之境。已有大多數殷實之民。遷居别地者。又聞經此次地震後。阿塔迷之温泉。忽然失其温度。蓋阿塔迷素以温泉著名。春夏之季。游者衆集之地也。亦可異已。又有盛傳將有大海潮之侵入其地者。於是居民益形恐懼。而遷徙益多。當局者雖時加勸止。然亦無效也。故其地震若再不歇止。恐上述兩地。將成邱墟矣。</p>
<p>（二）化妝品滲用鉛質之重申禁命　日本化妝品之製造。遠遜於歐美各國。其中如撲粉面粉等女人化妝品至今尙有滲用鉛質之事者。頃聞其内政省已有明令禁止此後以鉛質滲加粉類之中。蓋化妝粉内雜有鉛質。非但有捐於用者之皮膚。而最近據衛生家調查所得。謂孩童之生有腦膜炎者。大半係乳母或其生母施用鉛質粉之故。故内政省爲求人民之衛生計。不得不明令嚴禁之也。查化妝品禁滲鉛質之事。在日本於一九○○年間亦曾有令禁止。惟當時因商界反對甚烈。議决保留緩行。至今已三十年矣。乃有此次之重申禁令也。</p>
<p>（三）大選舉之損失　月前日本之大選舉。其國内民情之鼎沸。事業之停頓。吾人可於報紙上見之。其熱烈之態度。不由吾人不稍稍振發其愛國之心。據聞此次日本之大選舉。朝野人氏金錢之損失。幾及一千萬元。而每候補者。平均亦須費用至五萬元以上。其金錢之流入處。亦大都爲印刷家之囊。蓋選舉事宜。首仗宣傳。而宣傳除演講外。多賴印刷。故此次因選舉而發財之印刷所。爲數極多。即在東京一隅。金錢之流入印刷所者。爲數已達一百萬元之多。亦幸運兒哉。</p>

<p>五光十色之西齋　禮成。新宿舍各寢室公開參觀。同學中無不先事整理。佈置一新。或懸彩屏。或懸字畫。或設計若家庭。或寓意於逆旅。或長於雅潔。或富於美思。有設菓品以餉佳賓。有出紙筆以求題名。五光十色。不一而足。賓客之蒞止者。無慮數百。以本校女同學光臨最早。對於各室。讚不絶口。就中尤以一一八號之簡潔。爲來賓所屬目。衣香鬢影。爲新宿舍增寵多矣。</p>
<p>萬目睽睽之女生宿舍　交大男女同學。雖已三載。顧雙方極鮮往返。其宿舍僻居東北。故有稱之爲「冷宮」者。三載以還。從未開放。此次爲慶祝週年紀念起見。特破天荒開放一天。任人參觀。入門。由指導員吴佩紫女士肅客入。登樓。則王亨齡女士任招待。導觀三室。良覺富麗。壁間懸照片畫片甚多。其佈置之設計。别具風格。更詢其餘。則曰已下鍵矣。然則所謂開放。亦僅一小部分而已。女宿舍原爲敎員住宅。故房間大小均不一律。且屋宇陳舊。女新宿舍之建築似爲刻不容緩之要圖也。</p>
<p>游藝一斑　午後爲游藝。節目甚多。以二角戲爲最滑稽。後又有一西人奏手琴。一西女子操披亞那和之。其音絶佳。後又有火棍歌舞等。夜塲爲京劇。以張直夫先生之黑風帕爲最引人注意。參觀之女賓極爲衆多。秩序尙能維持。</p>
<p>直逼仙境之夜景　華燈初上。交大之情景。又爲之一變。蓋自大校門起繞操塲之四周。轉而之新宿舍。皆連續懸以彩燈。竚立遠望。直類繁星。而鐘樓及旗桿。復電炬燦然。間以彩色。美乃無藝。時則霧鬢風鬟。珊珊遲步於道左。燕語鶑啼。默點含情於花陰。此情此景。直疑非復人間矣。午夜劇終。盛會亦於此而宣告閉幕。</p>

<p>仲春之初。風雨浹旬。春色二分一分塵土。討春之土。恨何如也。梅園花事。强半孤負。昨以江南烟酒局長老友鄭君鍾岫之約。余亦亟思一顧園中。如探久别之故人也。又得張雲笙君與偕。三人驅車而往。旣至。入門一望。則香海風光。十餘五六。到眼花枝。或疎或密。如窺徐妃半面妝也。惟雪痕糝徑。暗香襲人。過客春衣。皆爲荀令矣。余等於誦豳堂外。啜茗閒談。鍾岫謂不日調任揚州。將與錫地湖山小别。恐二分明月。更夢萬樹梅花也。因倡議攝影。俾資紀念。余亟表同情。蓋不第留取春光。亦以慰他日雲樹之思耳。遂擇定天心台前草塲上。相與共攝一幀。花間人影或坐或立。更一怪石點綴其旁。孤峯突立。尤饒逸趣。爰題以四詩云。名園勝侶慰天涯。春在枝頭鳥作家。瘦影自憐同堃鶴。朅來山裏伴梅花。剛從雪海著泥痕。天外飛鴻爪偶存。莫怨遲來花半落。餘香一縷化吟魂。玲瓏一石證三生。松竹和梅有舊盟。笑指太湖波萬頃。爲儂惜别紀深情。鄭莊豪興喜停驂。張緒同遊意亦酣。此去揚州風月夜。二分春色夢江南。</p>

<p>友人某君。經商蒙古有年。前日來一信。述蒙古發現古物古書事。津津有味。因摘錄於下。</p>
<p>俄國東方探險隊。去歲由高寺洛氏爲領袖。至蒙古戈壁沙漠等處探險。時値隆冬。天氣嚴寒。高寺洛夫暫返莫斯科。其助手多人。仍繼續進行。探尋古蹟異物。旋覓得一古墓。諸人遂從事開掘。墓之深處。得白礬石棺一具。展視之。内有花氈掛帷。各種絲織物品。尙有金銀珠玉飾物多種。雕刻琢磨。皆極精巧。似非近代工匠所能爲。最後又掘獲古代手鈔書册七百卷。</p>
<p>字跡細小。隱約可辨。内分七國文字。所可讀識者。惟中國與印度二國之字體。其餘古書莫能辨識。書面裏以綢帛。裝訂極精。書箱上鐫有宋徽示三年二月識字樣。該探險隊自得此書後。珍同拱璧。聞將與花氈掛帷及飾物等。一併携返俄京古物保存所陳列云。</p>

<p>— 來</p>
<p>對於梅君之做工。使余感想到希臘之戲劇。蓋古書中有論希臘劇之作法者。每使人不易領略。今觀梅君之做工。方豁然有所領悟。</p>
<p>中劇之作法。非常之眞。不過非寫像之眞。乃藝術之眞。使觀者感覺比本來之眞還要眞。</p>
<p>余最愛看之劇。爲刺虎。有歷史文義上之氣味。而自刎之身段尤佳。</p>
<p>美國之一般戲劇家之做工。均覺呆板。梅君之做工。從眼之動。到袖之動。均恰當而止。恣態生動。絶無呆滯之病。</p>
<p>面部表情。有人以爲寫實。其實非寫實。也是一樣有規矩之變動。絶不是以暴烈感情之浮淺舉動爲目標。</p>
<p>中劇各角。在台上之地位。非常之好。梅之站立地位。時有變動。（如靠前或向後）然皆是極適當的地方。每一變動。令人視線一新。能使觀者永遠不倦。梅君眉部之化裝極佳。其白黑紅之布置。像古磁之美。至於俯仰坐立之姿態。皆與古畫相仿。</p>
<p>余對於梅君所唱之小嗓。毫無一點隔膜。余以爲梅之小嗓。與女子眞嗓之差别。即等於戲中模仿女子之身段。與女子自然動作之差别。可謂爲純是美術化。聽之毫無不快之感也。</p>
<p>楊君批評之後。詢畹華有無錯誤之點。畹云。批評極當。惟媿不敢承耳。並屢詢中劇各種規矩。畹一一具答。君聞之。拍案呌絶。并謂此方係眞正戲劇云云。以上楊君所談。係尙未見報者。故詳及之。其餘紐約各報。常有記載。不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>自畹華開演之日起。一週以内。有十處新排戲劇。先後出台。然賣座皆不及畹華之奸。目下已售出之戲票。在外邊漲至八元之多。以最近紐約市面情形而論。此種售價。固非易易。然一般與論。以爲吾輩即漲價八元。亦可滿座。現有數家最大劇場。來此接洽。有一家劇塲（案即國家大戲院）大致可容千餘座。刻已説妥。第三星期即移往演奏。將來或另定價目也。</p>

<p>蕊雲道。好啦。别釣胃口了。你旣説好了。我爲什麽不去。阿金道。什麽新戲。是不是戲台上有種種布景的。戲台前還有一個幕。把幕拽開來。裏面種種布景。就和眞的一樣咧。左詩晨道。可不是嗎。現在也有那種不三不四的新戲。上海漸漸兒流行起來了。也有布景也有幕。也有鑼鼓也有唱。那是一種叫做四不相。他們的是純純粹粹的新戲。單是習練也已經習練了好幾個月咧。不是他們那種馬馬虎虎的。不論阿貓阿狗。跳上去都可以做的。平日間一點不用練習。到了演戲的當兒。弄得前言不搭後語。那是眞正的新戲咧。阿金聽見了。更加起勁。説道。阿囡。那新戲比了老戲好看得多咧。他們並没有鑼鼓傢生。也没有唱。單是説話。那就我們容易懂得多。那種老戲。我們不知道他們唱的什麽。要是唱得長一點。我簡直是要在戲館裏打渴睡咧。懂得唱的人聽聽是有滋味的。我們不懂得唱的。不曉得他們在　些什麽。至於那些武戲吧。我們只看見紅面孔和黑面孔相打。翻筋斗。豎蜻蜓。倒是好看的。可惜他們玩來玩去。還是玩這一套兒。倒是那種新戲。情節也好。一句一句説話。我們都聽得清清楚楚。而且他從頭至尾。完全的一本戲。不是東截一段。西挖一節的。二少。你請阿囡。我也要去的呀。左詩晨道。這個自然。你是少不得的。你就是阿囡的待從武官。自然非請你不可的。阿金也不曉得什麽叫做侍從武官。又道。到了那天。我們要早些預備好了。不過大阿姨即使放蕊雲去看戲。伊還是老規矩。轉堂唱仍舊要到戲館裏來轉。那末正在好看頭上。勾魂票又要來了。最好到了那一天。給伊的娘説好了。無論什麽人來叫堂唱。不必來轉。就叫他們兩個。去代一代就完了。蕊雲道。不相干。倘然是寫出要我去的。他們還是要來轉的。左詩晨道。不妨事。到了那一天。包你没有人來轉。讓你安安穩穩從頭看至尾。决不來驚擾你一下子。蕊雲道。眞的嗎。若得如此。眞個要謝謝你呢。那末怎麽向吾娘説呢。恐怕伊不答應。左詩晨道。你不用管他。我自有法子。天機不可洩漏。預先不能説給你聽。到了那一天。總讓你安心看戲就是了。</p>

<p>去年十一月下旬美國通用公司。在紐約西門第五十七條街上。嘗一度召集股東會議。討論分派紅利事宜。據云通用公司近年來所派紅利之豐。爲世界各國。任何工廠所不及。即以去年之贏餘而言。竟得盡利百分之一百五十。各股東分得之紅利。計有四三、五○○四、○○○元之多。此外如職員之花紅。股東之股息。亦有四三、五○○、○○○元。在聖誕節之前。各股東咸相率前來。至公司方面。領取紅利。自此項消息傳出後。社會人士。莫不爲之驚異。蓋通用公司自成立以來。爲時不過二十年。且在八年之前。一般社會人士。對於通用公司之能否永久成立。或將解散。尙不能加以確説。通用公司之得以成立。在美國汽車界中。占有重要之地位也。窮源歸本。當歸功於都倫脱氏Ｗ·Ｃ·Ｄurant。當都氏之從事汽車事業也。滴在萌芽時代。一般社會人士。對於汽車事業。尙未有相當之信仰。故設非都氏而具有大無畏之精神。努力奮鬥。則通用公司必無今日之成績也。都氏旣具有先見之明。當其着手之初。先購畢克車廠。悉心經營力加整頓。不數年間。廠中所出畢克汽車。已氣象一新。不復如往日之粗劣矣。當是時也。畢克車廠。設於米西根弗林脱地方。馬車之車身。汽車之引擎。以及自由車與乎一切零件。均有製造。時則模型初具。設備簡單。與今日相較。不啻有天壤之隔矣。新廠之組織。創始於一九○九年。迄今僅二十年有奇也。其間經過不少周折。直至八年以前。所產車輛。始風行全球也。</p>
<p>都倫脱之處置廠中一切事宜也。井井有條。管理得宜。凡熟識之人。莫不爲之欽佩。渠爲樂於投資之人。而又有新思想也。自一九○五年至一九一○年。前後五年之中。都氏竭其全力。經營畢克車廠。自是以後。始入通用公司。而一九一○年通用之營業。全年已有五○、○○○、○○○元。盡利計有一○·○○○·○○○元。大戰時期。通用之營業。因特殊之關係。倍形發達。一九一七年全年所銷之車輛。價値已達一七二·○○○·○○○元。此後蒸蒸日上。逐年發展。一九一八年爲二七○·○○○·○○○元。而一九二○年已達五六七·○○○·○○○元矣。惟一九二一年之命運不佳。幾乎破產歷年所得盡利。最高之時。有七○·○○○·○○○元之多。其間中落之時。所遭損失。亦有三八·六八○·○○○元之多。通用之幾經周折。得以繼續存在。不告破產者。蓋因歷年已有優厚之利息。而資本之雄偉。尤覺難覓大資本家。出資購買者也。</p>
<p>此後公司方面又竭力整頓。加以改革。辛苦經營。始有今日之成績。而得以槶握全世界汽車事業之牛耳。當通用革新之初。主要目的。在求產車之神速。俾數量之加多。並用科學方法。對於機件之製造。加以改革。而銷路始得一日千里。日形發達。夫通用公司之得以有今日也。並非因資本之雄偉。分廠之繁多。其主要原因。乃係用人之得宜也。各廠所用職工。十九學識豐富。經騐充足。辦事之能力。爲任何工廠之職員所不及。是故能利用科學方法。將舊有機器。盡行改革。採用新式機器。製造各種車輛。於是所產車輛。成績之優良。倍於他廠。社會人士莫不樂於購買。而銷數亦因之得以大增。通用之得以有今日。當歸功於都倫脱。上文已言之矣。然除都氏以外。尙有一人。足爲讀者一告者。即司龍氏Al　fred　P·　Sloan　jr·，是也。渠自一九二○年起。即任通用之經理。此人於青年時代。即卒業於某大學。辦事能力。不亞於都氏。故若二人者。乃通用公司之柱石也。</p>
<p>當通用公司創辦之初。至一九○九年爲止。前後十二月中。所銷車輛。價値爲二九·○○○·○○○元。而凈利則有九·○○○·○○○元。當是時也。一般汽車界人。咸不信自是而後。通用公司所銷車輛。將超過二九·○○○·○○○元。然今日之銷車數量。即以去年最後之三月而言。亦當四十倍於一九○九年全年之數量也。通用公司自成立以來。不過二十年有奇。上文已言之矣。然在此二十年中。其進展之速。實出我人意料之外。迄今資本之濃厚。力量之偉大。竟無與爲之匹敵也。以資本而言。目前已有美金一·二○○·○○○元。而廠中所有職工。爲數亦已有二○○○·○○○人矣。每年產貨車客車。已達二·○○○·○○○輛。此又豈爲二十年前之人所能意料耶。且通用公司之工程方面。每有出奇制勝之處。如以馬力廢除。利用汽油。採用電流系統等。皆首先發明。至今能享盛名者。蓋亦因此耳。</p>
<p>自一九二一年而後。通用公司之營業。更有一日千里之勢。一九二三年全年所銷之車輛。總數爲七○○·○○○·○○○元。而一九二六年已達一·○○○·○○○·○○○元矣。一九二七年爲一·二六九·五一九·六七三元·至於去年之銷數。尤屬駭人聞聽。即以先前之九月而言。所銷車輛。已有一·六○○·○○○輛。貨車客車。均包括在内。設予以正確之統計。則美國全境人民。包括女人及少孩。通用公司在九個月中。每七十五人中必售去汽車一輛也。直至前年爲止。美國全境所有之汽車。通用之出品。已占三分之一。目前廠中所僱職工。其數已達二一○·○○○人。較之美國鋼鐵廠。賓賽爾佛尼亞鐵路。及美國德律風電報公司所用工人。相去不遠。而上述四大工廠。所僱工人。總計已有一·○○○·○○○人矣。此外通用公司之代理商人。目前亦已有二○·○○○人矣。通用公司。近年以來。發展旣有若是其神速。於是所處地位。亦日見穩固。而美國之汽車事業。近來進展之速。得以如此者。其主要原因。蓋係人口之增加。而一家之中。大都備有汽車二輛。他如舊車之損壞。添購新車。亦足增加銷路。大槪汽車一輛。經過七年有半。已不堪再用。而近年海外貿易之發展。亦足增加通用之銷路。根據歷年之紀錄。通用公司之汽車。出口者一九二六年爲九八·○○○·○○○元。一九二七年爲一七二·○○○·○○○元。至於去年之海外貿易。根據通用公司事前之估計當有二六○·○○○·○○○元。此數已與一九一八年前。歷年通用所產汽車之數量相等矣。</p>
<p>通用公司之分廠。開設於世界各國者。連同經售之商人。目前已有六·○○○處。勢力所及。已達一百餘國家。是故海外銷數之發達。其原因即在分廠及經理之繁多也。且通用之車輛。運銷海外者。並非以裝配之汽車。直接運出。大都由各地分廠自裝。蓋通用公司。近來發見車輛之在國外裝配者。較爲經濟。而售價亦略可低廉。是故决計利用分廠制度。回憶一九二四年之時。通用公司。首先設分廠於哥卑哈根。自是以後。各地分廠。繼續開設。迄今如倫敦。巴黎。斯德哥爾摩。安德威伯。伯林。馬德里地。亞立山堡。不宜諾斯艾利斯。聖保羅。布里斯本。威靈頓。大阪。八打威。南非等地。均有分廠之開設。是故汽車之銷數。目前尙未到達　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　中國。日本。印度等這東各國。通用之車輛。亦到處可見。以事實而言。無論高原低澤。深山幽谷。目前通用汽車。殆無處而勿到也。各色人種。語言雖各不同。而對於通用汽車之信仰。則如出一軌。故通用之汽車事業。前途尙有無窮之希望也。我人試拭而待之。</p>

<p>復次言其他諸國各鐵路。</p>

<p>從以上簡括之叙述。即可見世界鐵路採用列車調度制之趨勢。及其制度之異同。至綜合各國制度比較觀察所得之結論。與夫體察我國情形。認爲可供參酌採用之具體辦法。已一一具載本計劃書内。茲不復贅其有爲計劃書所不及詳論者。特申述數端於次。以資説明。</p>
<p>（一）組織　集中制與分段制各有優異之點。各路以採用何種爲有利。則當視各路之管理制度。路綫長短。運輸繁簡而定。大體言之。集中制度使全路一切運輸事務統籌全局。故對於酌劑各段運輸情形。分配車輛。利用機車能力等等。功效易著。英倫各路路綫較諸各國及屬地各路爲短。故採用集中制頗稱適當。至美國路綫多數蔓延甚廣。且多屬大批貨運故非採用分段制不可。我國各大路綫多綿長兩三省。以地形論。當以分段制爲宜。但各路運輸遠不如歐美鐵路之繁重。則組織制度。應以簡單爲經濟二。以人才缺乏。集中制能使全路運轉事宜集中於比較少數人之手。故於可能範圍内。應以採用集中制爲宜。</p>
<p>（二）專用電話　列車調度制之運用。當以裝置完善之專用電話爲不可缺少之利器</p>
<h3 id="c255">雪佛蘭服務站　吉人 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>

<p>（三）車輛分配　車輛分配有由調度處兼理之者。如倫敦米蘭鐵路是。有另組機關辦理者。如倫敦東北鐵路是。然之米蘭一路。已有貨車十二萬八千餘輛。種類不下百餘。而我國合全國鐵路貨車計之。僅一萬七千餘輛。各大路貨車最多不過三四千輛之譜。事務繁簡之懸殊。不啻數十倍。故由調度室兼管車輛分配事項。當無不能勝任愉快之慮。</p>
<p>（四）機車及車上員役之調度　車守旣屬車務人員。當在車務管理之下。其餘如司機火夫等工役之輪値調遣。旣機車之分配指揮。或由車務管理。或由機務管理。各國鐵路因組織不同而異。但此等事務旣與列車調度有相當關係。應由一首領兼理之。自易收效。各國鐵路將來趨勢。必多數傾向於此項組織。此雖與我國鐵路車機兩處職務劃分之現行制度不同。但吾人當以原則上是否健全。與事實上是否適當爲斷。故計劃書内關於機務方面。多持此項主張。藉示進圖革新。不爲現制縛束之意。</p>
<p>抑最後著者更有欲進一言者。英國倫敦大學運輸學敎授莎陵敦氏（Ｅ·　Ｒ·　Ｓherrngton）嘗揭列車調度制之精義。謂「此制在於集中列車之調度於比較少數有高深訓練。且受高級俸給之人員之手。復使其對於該管全綫運輸。了然無遺。」是故雖有良法美意。尤不可無實施之人才。善爲運用。莊子所謂不龜手之藥一也。或以覇。或不免於世世洴澼統。此則在於全國路界同人之自奮。區區計劃之作。其所補益者。直微末不足道耳。（完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Feng's Army Advances Eastward Along the Longhai Railway <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Main Troops Still in the Gongxian and Luoyang Area</p>
<p>Wan Xuancai's Troops Advance from Kaifeng Towards Lanfeng</p>
<p>Feng's Army Continues Eastward, Seemingly Aiming for Shandong</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Longhai Railway staff to foreign organizations, Wan Xuancai's troops are attacking Lanfeng. Some Northwest Army cavalry has arrived in Zhengzhou, but has not entered the city. The main infantry force is still in the Gongxian and Luoyang area. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Wan Xuancai's advance troops are near Kaifeng. (Special dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wan Xuancai appointed his brigade commander, Li Guanglong, as the Zhengzhou Garrison Commander. Sun Liangcheng arrived in Zhengzhou with his entourage. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang is in Tongguan, and Lu Zhonglin is in Luoyang. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to railway sources, the situation on the border between Jiangsu and Henan is very peaceful after the resolution of Sun Dianying's troops. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Chunrong telegraphed from Pingdingshan on the 31st, stating that his commander's family members have been safely relocated and requested Li Fuying to provide care. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The telegraph lines between Zhengzhou and Hankou have been restored. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Yu Feipeng returned to Xuzhou on the 1st after inspecting the military stations in Jinan. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The two divisions of the Shanxi Army led by Fu Zuoyi began their attack on Jinan from Dezhou and Nanpi on the night of the 30th. At the same time, the Northwest Army entering Kaifeng also began advancing towards Lanfeng, intending to assist the Shanxi Army's attack on Jinan from the side. (Electric News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Northwest Army initially feigned an attempt to capture Wuhan, seemingly concentrating its forces in the Hubei province area. However, this is not the case. They are continuing their eastward advance along the Longhai Railway, with their true objective being Shandong province. This has become increasingly apparent recently. The vanguard of the Northwest Army, advancing from Zhengzhou towards Kaifeng, will wait for the main force to fully enter Zhengzhou before launching a full-scale eastward advance. Ren Shiyou has been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, commanding the armies of Wan Xuancai, Sun Dianying, and Liu Chunrong in their offensive. The forces of Han Fuju, currently in Kaifeng and Lanfeng, have retreated eastward, seeking to contact the Central Army. (Electric News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) As of the 30th, 30,000 Northwest Army troops had entered Zhengzhou, with more troops continuously advancing eastward. Feng Yuxiang's strategy is to wait for the majority of the Northwest Army to concentrate in Zhengzhou before launching a full-scale eastward advance. He has appointed Ren Shiyou as the Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, to command the armies of Wan Xuancai, Sun Dianying, and Liu Chunrong in their offensive. The forces of Han Fuju, currently in Kaifeng and Lanfeng, have retreated eastward, seeking to contact the Central Army. (Electric News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Irish Movement <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The largest of Britain's dependencies. In Asia, it is India. In Europe, it is Ireland. Today, the independence movement of the Indian people is seeking to achieve its goals through non-violent resistance. The independence movement of Ireland also seems to be continuing. During his recent stay in the United States, Mr. de Valera, leader of the Nationalist Party, repeatedly stated his intentions: first, upon returning to his country, he is determined to reorganize the new government and vows to complete his long-held aspiration for Irish independence; second, if his party can come to power as desired, it will announce policies to create a unified and independent Irish republic. It is known that the Nationalist Party of Ireland has a strength in the parliament that is no less than that of the ruling party. If it unites with one or two sympathetic parties, it will certainly be able to occupy a majority of the seats. Therefore, Mr. de Valera's ambition to achieve independence is not something unattainable.</p>
<p>Since the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed in 1921, Southern Ireland has broken away from the United Kingdom and created the Free State. The position of the Free State within the British Empire is the same as that of Canada, merely a self-governing dominion. Although the Chairman of the Executive Council is elected by the Parliament (i.e., the President), it is still under the rule of the British Empire. It must fulfill various obligations in military and economic affairs. Therefore, the Irish people are not satisfied. Recently, due to the stagnation of industry, the difficulty in managing finance, and the inability to resolve issues such as unemployment and immigration, the idea of achieving complete independence has been further stimulated, and the continuation of the movement is deemed unpostponable. The greatest goal is to demand the restoration of the Irish language in order to encourage the patriotism of the Irish people. This is also an inevitable phenomenon in the rising tide of national movements.</p>
<p>Since the rise of national movements, we observe that the attitude taken by various governments is most lenient and moderate in the case of Britain. For example, in the current non-violent resistance of India, only the mayor was detained for ten days, and not a single other volunteer was arrested. Some say that leniency and moderation are precisely what arouse the desire for independence in other colonies and autonomous regions. However, one does not know that in this era, the more severe the measures, the more they will inspire the determination to struggle. Disputes will probably become even more intense. Such a problem, driven by the general trend, can never be eliminated by hand.</p>

<p>Renamed the Third Route Army</p>
<p>Yan and Feng Assume Office Yesterday</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yan Xishan ordered all agencies to end the Third Group Army Headquarters and the Third Demobilization Area Headquarters, and changed them to the General Headquarters of the Third Route Army of the Republic of China Army, using the new seal from the 31st. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today, the telegram of Yan Xishan assuming office has not arrived. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yan Xishan decided to assume the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy in Taiyuan on the 1st, and at the same time telegraphed the whole country, stating that he was taking office based on the recommendation of party members. On the one hand, he made the same notification to the diplomatic corps, and sought their recognition of the belligerent group. After Yan Xishan took office, he immediately went to Shijiazhuang and assumed the command of the entire army. Feng Yuxiang assumed the position of Deputy Commander in Shanzhou at the same time. (United News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is expected that Yan Xishan will assume the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces today. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yan Xishan telegraphed to the newly received agencies in Beiping and Tianjin yesterday, saying, "I hope that according to the salary regulations of the agencies of the Third Group Army, the maximum monthly salary for a simplified appointment should not exceed five hundred yuan, three hundred yuan for a recommended appointment, and the appointed should also be reduced by the agencies. Please prepare the budget according to this standard, so as to be able to audit and seize." (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Quan Qibao, Director of the Diplomatic Archives Office, said, "Yan Xishan believes that the archives are important and ordered me to be responsible for taking over. All gentlemen in this office must be pragmatic and realistic." (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Political Figures from Various Factions Plan to Form a Northern Government <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Chen Gongbo and Others Will Hold an Enlarged Meeting</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Gongbo and Zou Lu have agreed to hold an enlarged meeting, first to establish a central cadre, and then to generate a political conference, organized by accommodating figures from various factions. Gui representative Lu Weigan also participated in this discussion. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The headquarters announced a telegram from Beiping on the 1st: Zou Lu and Xie Chi, representatives of the Xishan faction, and Chen Gongbo and Wang Faqin, representatives of the reorganization faction, went to Taiyuan a few days ago to discuss opposing the central government with Yan Xishan. They are now actively organizing a puppet government. The issue of party formation was not mentioned. Politicians such as Zhang Shizhao and Li Shucheng strongly persuaded Yan Xishan to separate party and government, and vigorously advocated multi-partyism. Therefore, Chen Gongbo and others could not gain a foothold in Taiyuan and have now come to Beiping together. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A special train on the Beiping-Hankou Railway is prepared to welcome Chen Gongbo and Wang Faqin to Taiyuan. Please board the train before 9:25 tonight. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today's "Xin Chen Bao" and other newspapers widely published Chen Gongbo's speeches and lecture records. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Feng's Army Plans to Attack Nanyang <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Central Troops Deploy a Solid Defense</p>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun told people that Feng Yuxiang seemed to have the intention of attacking Nanyang with all his strength. The Feng's army, which previously attacked Xiangfan from Jingziguan, is also said to be heading to Nanyang, and after concentrating in Nanyang, will attack Xiangfan again. The Central Army, stationed on the Pinghan Railway and in northern Hubei, totals 250,000 men. If Feng's troops come to attack, they will never let a single soldier return alive. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Aviation Administration has dispatched five aircraft, which will arrive in Hankou immediately and be under the command of ____. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Xu Yuanquan returned to Zhaoyang after inspecting the front line, and telegraphed He Chengjun on the 31st, requesting instructions as needed, and expressing his loyalty to the party and the country with sincerity, vowing to annihilate the rebels and secure the homeland of the party and the country. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Wang Jinyu decided to postpone his trip to Luohe after the deployment of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway was completed. After He Yingqin arrives, he will set off for Xuyan with He Chengjun. He Chengjun will also transfer to Xiangfan. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun received a telegram from Zhang Yougu on the 1st, saying that fighter planes had been dispatched for days to scout in Jingziguan, Xichuan, and other places, and bombs were dropped, killing many rebel soldiers. The enemy in Xichuan has stopped advancing. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Li Yunheng dispatched a brigade of soldiers to Laohekou for joint defense. Most of them were suppressing bandits in the Yicheng area. Li went to Yicheng in person to inspect on the morning of the 1st. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Military Plans of the Shanxi Faction <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The headquarters announced a telegram from Beiping on the 1st: The recent military plan of the Yan Army is to have Sun Chu, Feng Pengzhu, and Yang Yaofang's three divisions as one route, under the command of Sun Chu, advancing from Daming towards Yanzhou and Jining; Fu Zuoyi, Li Shengda, and Wang Jingguo's three divisions as one route, under the command of Fu Zuoyi, advancing along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway towards Jinan; and Yang Xiaou, Zhang Huizhi, and Li Fuying as the general reserve team, concentrated in the Baihe and Tianjin area of the Beining Railway, specializing in defending against Fengtian (Zhang Xueliang). (3) Yan Xishan said that if Feng Yuxiang did not go to Zhengzhou to supervise the army, he would not leave Taiyuan, and he would not organize the government until Feng Yuxiang took the position of Deputy Commander, and he would issue salaries to the Northwest Army. (4) Yan and Feng appear to be in agreement but are not. Since Feng Yuxiang left Taiyuan, there has been no direct communication or correspondence between them. Occasionally, news is indirectly relayed through Sun Chu and Lu Zhonglin. It seems that Feng Yuxiang hates Yan Xishan for his confinement, and has learned a painful lesson, but he has not been able to break with him for the time being because Feng's wife, Li Dequan, is still being held hostage by Yan Xishan in Shanxi, and has not yet regained her freedom, as if she is a kidnapped hostage who has not yet escaped danger, so he has no choice but to pretend to cooperate.

<p>Six Foreigners Were Kidnapped</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhu De and Mao Zedong have disturbed the three provinces of Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong for two years. Now, the northwest and west parts of Jiangxi Province and the Gan River basin between Ji'an and Ganzhou are all under their control. The bandit soldiers burn, kill, rob, and are extremely violent, and especially hate foreigners. They scurry around, and before the suppressing soldiers arrive, they have already run far away. On March 26, they captured Yuanzhou, looted for three days, and then withdrew. In this battle, the county magistrate was thrown into boiling oil, the principal of the high school and several Chinese preachers and respected figures of the local church were brutally killed, and the owners of many shops were tortured and ordered to pay 60,000 yuan. After entering the city, six foreigners were kidnapped, including the British couple Mr. and Mrs. Tors, and the American Ms. Kimmel, all of whom were working for the China Inland Mission. They have been taken elsewhere. The remaining three managed to escape. There are only a thousand soldiers stationed in Nanchang, half of whom are deployed along the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway, so the provincial defense is weak and very worrying. The families of missionaries have already moved away. The bandit troubles in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are also severe. Many towns near Shashi have been looted, and many residents have been tortured to death. Even around Hankou, there are occasional bandit alerts. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to a telegram from Changsha, local bandits and communist troops are rising everywhere on the border between Jiangxi and Hunan provinces, robbing and looting at will. The most severely affected is Yuanzhou in Jiangxi Province. Yuanzhou was occupied by bandits on the 23rd of last month, and after carrying out killings and looting, they withdrew on the 27th. The county magistrate was burned to death after being doused in kerosene, and the principal of the school and others were all killed. All the shops in the city were completely looted, and countless residents were killed. Three foreign missionaries in the local church, including two British and one American, were kidnapped.

<p>The Prohibition of Silver Coin Imports Is Temporarily Not Implemented</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance announced that although the amount of imported goods has decreased since the customs duties have been converted to gold units, this method of collecting gold has the subtle effect of making up for deficiencies, and domestic goods are being used more widely, which has also expanded trade. Therefore, the recent customs revenue has not suffered a large loss due to the decrease in the amount of imported goods. Japanese merchants had previously opposed the collection of gold in the Andong Customs, but after we refused to collect at the original rate, they did not insist much. The current temporary measure is to have the customs record the amount of increase in gold units compared to the old system, and it will be resolved together after the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement is approved. There are no more problems in this regard. Regarding the prohibition of silver coin imports, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce once proposed this as an emergency measure. However, after a lengthy study of the domestic and international financial situation and the comparison of advantages and disadvantages by Ministers Song and Kong, it was considered that it would not have a great effect in the short term, so it has not been implemented.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance had previously rejected the request of the Wheat Flour Special Tax Bureau of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Region to exempt the special tax and abolish the export ban on Chinese flour. Now, according to the bureau's transfer of the original request from the Shanghai Wheat Flour Association to cancel the export ban, it is said that Chinese flour shipped to Japan, Little Luzon, Saigon and other places is subject to a heavy tax of seven or five corners per bag. Chinese businessmen are originally unwilling to take losses, only because overseas Chinese are scattered in the South Seas Islands, buying and eating foreign grain, and suffering losses in pound prices, they have sent telegrams to China. Once the purchase of Chinese flour is approved for shipment, the Shanghai factories may be able to consider ordering foreign wheat to maintain the livelihood of workers, and it is not for exporting to aid foreigners. It is also proved that it is not related to the food for the people in the disaster area. Considering that its theory and facts are related to the people's food and the development of industry, it is specially submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. The Executive Yuan ordered the two ministries of industry and commerce and finance to investigate. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e62">Anglo-Egyptian Conference Opens <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Solving Political Disputes Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Taking the Former Egyptian Prime Minister's Proposal as the Basis for Negotiation</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 31st - The Anglo-Egyptian conference, which opened here to resolve political disputes between the two countries, is led by Foreign Minister Henderson as the chief representative of the British side and Prime Minister Nahas as the chief representative of the Egyptian side. Henderson delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the British government at a public meeting held at the Foreign Office today, stating that both sides had gathered here to consolidate the friendship between the people of the two countries with a treaty. The interests of both sides are similar in many respects, and he refuses to consider the possibility of this meeting failing. Egypt should be included among the nations with the qualifications of a free, independent, and sovereign country, to suit its ancient greatness and recent progress. Nahas replied that the failure of previous Anglo-Egyptian negotiations did not weaken his determination to reach a sincere understanding with Britain this time. He is confident that this work will succeed. Britain, as the mother of freedom, will naturally welcome Egypt, the mother of all cultures, to join the League of Nations. Subsequently, a closed-door meeting began, and the negotiations will be based on the Anglo-Egyptian treaty proposal published last August after talks in London between the former Egyptian Prime Minister, Mahamed, and Henderson. According to the British Foreign Minister, this proposal is the extreme limit that he can advise the British government to accept.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Japanese Cabinet Passes Naval Reduction Reinstruction <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Prime Minister Submits a Request to the Emperor for Approval</p>
<p>Telegraph Sent to Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki Immediately</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 1st - The reininstruction proposal was passed by the Cabinet today according to the original plan of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Prime Minister Hamaguchi went to the Imperial Palace at 3:00 PM to report to the Emperor. After obtaining the Emperor's approval, a telegraph was immediately sent back to Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 1st - Before the Cabinet meeting today, Prime Minister Hamaguchi summoned Foreign Minister Shidehara and Vice Minister of the Navy Yamanashi to his official residence for final consultations. It was decided to adopt the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' plan. In addition to acknowledging the figures requested by Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki, this agreement will be a short-term agreement until 1936 and will expire upon its completion. The Cabinet meeting then opened and submitted the plan.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 1st - After the dissolution of the Hamaguchi Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Hamaguchi entered the palace at 3:30 PM, presented the contents of the reininstruction to the Emperor, and provided an explanation. The Emperor has already approved it, so the reininstruction was immediately telegraphed by Foreign Minister Shidehara to Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 1st - At the Cabinet meeting today, Vice Minister of the Navy Yamanashi and the director also attended. The meeting opened at noon. First, Prime Minister Hamaguchi began by stating that the reininstruction proposal was based on the two major principles of world peace and reducing the burden on the people. He then described the process of deciding on the reininstruction. Next, Foreign Minister Shidehara stated that since January 21st, the Japanese plenipotentiary had repeatedly discussed with Britain and the United States, seeking the understanding of various countries, based on the instructions given by the previous government. There were beneficial meetings with the two plenipotentiaries, Matsudaira and Ri'da, and the process of concluding an unofficial compromise between Japan and the United States and the instructions. The Ministry in charge presented the reininstruction proposal, which consisted of two papers: one was to inquire again about the doubts regarding the reininstruction, and continued to describe the Japanese government's policy; the other was the points that became problematic in this reininstruction, including (1) the Japanese government's recognition of the principle of the Japan-US compromise plan, (2) the number of large cruisers included in this treaty, in order to avoid restricting Japan's holdings, Japan reserves the right to propose new holdings at the meeting in 1935, (3) the form of reservation is left to the discretion of Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki, (4) Regarding submarines, the principle of possessing 52,700 tons is recognized, but from the point of view of Japan's shipbuilding skills, it is hoped that the expert committee will have appropriate negotiations, (5) This treaty is limited to the end of 1936, and its effectiveness will be completely eliminated upon expiry, all of which must be clearly stated, and the next meeting will be convened in 1935. Foreign Minister Shidehara gave a detailed explanation. Next, Vice Minister Yamanashi stated that although the requirement of summarizing 70% of auxiliary vessels in the proposal can be agreed to, the naval side felt quite regretful about the two points among the three major principles, namely 70% of large cruisers and the autonomous possession of submarines, and expressed opposition. However, since the navy is a part of the government, if it has already been decided, there is no other way, and expressed his attitude. Next, the Minister of Finance expressed his approval from a financial perspective, and Minister of Railways Eguchi also expressed his approval, so the reininstruction was decided according to the original plan, and the meeting adjourned at 2:10 PM.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 1st - Although Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki's request for instructions was approved regarding the portion of submarines in the reininstruction proposal, in order to prevent the cessation of submarine construction, the ship age was required to be shortened from thirteen years to ten years. This is to accommodate the navy's position.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 1st - The heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy held a final consultation meeting last night. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not clearly indicate the contents of the reininstruction proposal at the meeting, and the Navy did not express any opinions. The points of contention between the two sides were not resolved and the meeting dispersed. According to Vice Minister Yoshida, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy have different positions and their opinions cannot be consistent. However, the reininstruction proposal made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also took into consideration the opinions and hopes of the Navy. After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' reininstruction, only the general outline of the Japan-US agreement was decided, and the details will be decided by the plenipotentiary. There is still room for negotiation, and if negotiations are conducted directly, it may be possible to fully establish the treaty format.</p>

<p>Deciding to Issue the Agenda</p>
<p>British and French Continue Talks</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 31st - The heads of the naval conference met at St. James's Palace this morning and decided to issue the agenda so that the heads of delegations can consider it on Wednesday. French Foreign Minister Briand and British Foreign Minister Henderson continued their talks this afternoon, discussing political issues, with experts from both sides assisting.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 31st - In the House of Commons today, a Member of Parliament asked if the government was still determined to establish a five-power agreement rather than a two- or three-power agreement. The British Prime Minister replied coldly, "Yes, sir." Another Member of Parliament asked whether the British representatives at the naval conference had made proposals regarding the British dismantling of four Hawkins-class cruisers. The British Prime Minister replied that negotiations were still underway and he could not answer this question. He also said that temporary proposals can be changed at any time, and whatever agreement there may be, it must be orderly and without any bias.</p>
<p>Dentsu, London, 31st - The French side believes that Britain's announcement on the 30th of the Anglo-French negotiations disregards the previous understanding that prohibited the publication of everything before the negotiations were completed, and is very indignant, saying that there is no other way but to break off.</p>
<h3 id="e65">German New Cabinet Meets to Discuss Policy Guidelines <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Oath of Allegiance to the Republican Constitution</p>
<p>Most Creditor Countries Express Sympathy</p>
<p>Kokumin, Berlin, 31st - After discussing policy guidelines, the new cabinet members took an oath of allegiance to the Republican Constitution today and will announce their political views in the parliament tomorrow. However, the fate of the new cabinet will depend on the parliament on Wednesday, when the Socialist Party will propose a vote of no confidence, and the vote of the Nationalist Party will suddenly have a decisive impact. However, the attitude of the party has not yet been expressed. They will probably decide whether to support it after listening to the agricultural policy announced by the new cabinet.</p>
<p>Kokumin, Berlin, 31st - Most of Germany's creditor countries, except France, have expressed sympathetic welcome for the new German cabinet. Only the French press is concerned because it previously opposed the inclusion of conservative leaders who had opposed the Young Plan, Hill and Nationalist Party figure Trierner, in the cabinet. However, most newspapers also believe that the Brüning cabinet is the only way to resolve the political crisis. For example, Le Journal de Paris stated that Brüning has always been a supporter of the Young Plan and, of course, opposes diplomatic policies with a retaliatory nature. Le Petit Journal stated that although Brüning may cause neighboring countries to be wary, it is hoped that he can comply with the times and implement financial reorganization, otherwise the Young Plan will be like the mortgage of a house that has been in disrepair for a long time. British and American newspapers have no such concerns. They generally believe that the change of cabinet is purely an internal affair and has nothing to do with diplomacy. They claim that the reappointment of Curtiss as Foreign Minister and the personality of President Hindenburg can both guarantee the invariance of German diplomatic policy. President Hindenburg's integrity and sincerity are beyond doubt, and his power seems to have become more consolidated after recent political developments.</p>

<p>Kokumin, Rome, 31st - Fascism and the Catholic Church have apparently reached a complete understanding and are reconciled as before. The Secretary-General of the Fascist Party has instructed local secretaries that members of various organizations affiliated with the Church may be members of the Party in the future, and the Church's newspaper has expressed warm welcome for this decision, saying that it is enough to eliminate the last obstacle to the friendship between the Church and the Fascist state.</p>
<p>Kokumin, Rome, 31st - The Fascist Party Congress has passed the plan to arm 300,000 members of the Party and resolved that officers in the group must receive special military training. All physically fit members of the Party should serve in the civilian army for at least one year.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 31st - The report of the Commission of Inquiry into the disturbances in Palestine last August generally blames the Arabs, saying that the cause of the Arab killing of Jews was their disappointment with their political and national aspirations and their fear of their economic future. The recent causes of the disturbances were (1) the various details arising from the Wailing Wall, (2) the activities of the Islamic Holy Places Protection Association, (3) the arguments of the newspapers inciting the people, and (4) the inadequacy of the military and police force. However, these disturbances were not a hatred of the British. The report advocates that the British government should declare its policy as soon as possible and implement it, and that this declaration should include the provisions in the mandate, stipulating the correct interpretation of protecting non-Jews. The report also advocates re-notifying the Zionist Organization, informing it that it is not allowed to have any participation in the government of Palestine. The report finally advocates deciding the ownership of the Wailing Wall as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Indian Parliament Passes the Tariff Act <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 31st - The Indian Tariff Act was passed in Parliament today with one amendment. This amendment was proposed by Indian members of Parliament and accepted by the government, amending the preferential treatment enjoyed by Britain on certain cotton cloths to avoid competing with Indian cloths. In practical terms, British plain-colored cloth, that is, unbleached cloth, will have no preferential treatment, but other kinds of cloth will have it. In other words, those who apply the three-anna-and-a-half tariff have no preferential treatment, while those who apply the value-added tax method have preferential treatment. This case was passed after the members of Parliament of the Kuomintang left the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e69">U.S. House of Representatives Discusses the Tariff Act <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Kokumin, Washington, 31st - Judging from the attitude of the House of Representatives today, it can pass the tariff bill submitted by the Senate and transfer it to the joint committee of the two houses for review. This matter is likely to be realized on Wednesday or Thursday. According to this committee, it is composed of members of the two houses, and the purpose is to reconcile the differing opinions of the two houses on this case. The speed of the House of Representatives in dealing with this case this time contains conditional effects. The so-called conditions are the rights of the House of Representatives to vote separately on the tax rates of sugar, cement, timber and other items in the tariff bill.</p>

<p>Saionji's Illness Affects the Political Situation</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 1st - Duke Saionji Kimmochi, who has been repeatedly reported to be seriously ill, is 82 years old this year, and all parties are worried. The Duke is the highest statesman in Japan and the only person most deeply trusted by the Emperor. After the two Genro, Yamagata and Matsukata, he consulted with the Emperor. What the Duke replied has often had major results in the political situation. This is well known to the world. If there is an emergency, it will have a great impact on the political situation in the future. Therefore, the current question is whether the Genro system, the Emperor's highest advisory body, will survive. This is what the world is paying attention to. Duke Saionji once advocated that he be the last Genro and that it be abolished thereafter. Duke Saionji has spoken of this intention in a definite way to all parties in the high echelons, so eight or nine out of ten of Duke Saionji's wishes can be expected to be realized. In any case, there will be no intention to overturn Duke Saionji and grant the treatment of a new Genro, but since there is no Genro, to what will the Emperor's highest advisory body belong? It is said that the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Imperial Household, the Privy Council, and the speakers of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives will be at the center, and a new method of consultation will be adopted.</p>

<p>The newly appointed members of the Jiangsu Provincial Government held a swearing-in ceremony at 9:30 AM this morning (the 1st) in the auditorium of the Provincial Government. Those present included the Chairman of the Provincial Government Ye Chucang, members Hu Pu'an, Chen Qicai, Chen Hexian, Sun Hongzhe, He Yushu, Li Mingyang, Luo Liangjian, Wang Chonghui representing the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government, Tao Gongheng representing the Executive Yuan, Xu Dongfan and Fan Guang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jin Baoshan of the Ministry of Health, Bi Jingqian of the Auditing Yuan, Zhang Quan and Ren Jiaqi of the Garrison Headquarters, Enkebaatu of the Legislative Yuan, Dong Xiangrui of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, Chen Dasan of the Ministry of Interior, Xu Pucheng of the Zhejiang Water Police, Zhang Daofan, Ye Xiufeng, and Zhang Yuanyang of the Provincial Party Consolidation Committee, representatives of various institutions and organizations, and staff members of the Provincial Government's departments, totaling about a thousand people. After the meeting and salute, Wang Chonghui, representing the National Government, presented the seal and delivered an instruction, which stated, "Jiangsu occupies a special position in China's geography. Politics, culture, and financial resources are all the best in the country. Chairman Ye and the members take office today. I will say two things on behalf of the colleagues in the Central Government. Now, political and social physiologists use a person's physiological proportions to describe the position of politics. The center is the head of the person, the provincial government is the abdomen of the person, and the counties are the limbs of the person. The head must rely on the body to introduce the brain's command of the limbs. There has never been a case where the abdomen is not healthy but the head can clearly command the limbs as desired. Therefore, the center is to the counties, and the provincial government will be the pivot to make the administration as desired. Chairman Ye has a history of revolutionary struggle and experience. In the future, he will be able to popularize Jiangsu's counties in accordance with the central government's general principles for finance, education, transportation construction, etc. The benefit of Jiangsu is the blessing of the world. I wish you all good health on behalf of my colleagues in the Central Government." Next, Tao Gongheng, representing the Executive Yuan, delivered a speech, which stated, "The new Director of Finance, Member Chen, once served in Zhejiang as the Director of Finance. He is good at managing finances and is honest. Director Hu is a Chinese scholar. He is coming to serve in civil affairs. The other new and old directors of departments and provincial members are all virtuous officials with outstanding achievements. Chairman Ye has expressed to the Executive Yuan in Beijing that the first problem in Jiangsu's political facilities is bandit suppression. Now there are many bandits in the four townships, the wealthy live in Shanghai, and the less wealthy live in the city. There is no one in the township government, and financial resources will be exhausted. Chairman Ye has the determination to suppress bandits, which is not only a blessing for Jiangsu Province, but also a good model for the central government to command other provinces." Then, representatives of the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and representatives of the Provincial Party Headquarters delivered speeches. Finally, Chairman Ye Chucang replied, "Today, I am very honored to receive the encouragement from the swearing-in officer and the representatives. The more hope there is, the more uneasy I feel. We are ordered by the central government to do things for the people of Jiangsu. We feel that we are here to do things, not to be officials like in the past bureaucratic era. Therefore, we must now fulfill our obligations, not enjoy our rights. It is our duty to fulfill our obligations and do well. If there is no achievement, then we have not fulfilled our obligations. We only feel that we dare not take credit. If there are any mistakes or omissions, it is our fault. We are always uneasy and have no time to be happy. Perhaps this uneasiness will reduce negligence and mistakes. I hope that the central government and all sectors will often encourage us." After the speech, the ceremony was completed and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e77">The Yellow River in Shandong Province is in Extreme Danger <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River in this province has just passed the ice run stage, and the peach blossom floods are about to arrive. The downstream areas are in extreme danger. The most critical issue is the dike closure project at Hujiatan in Lijin downstream. This breach occurred in February of last year. Last summer, Provincial Government Commissioner Yan Rongde went to close the breach, spending 300,000 yuan, but the more they tried to close it, the larger the breach became. Generally, river works are most afraid of closing breaches during high water; nine out of ten attempts fail. It is not fair to blame Mr. Yan alone. In winter, when the water receded, the breach was only two or three feet deep. The River Affairs Bureau estimated that the cost of closing the breach would be 70,000 yuan, which could be easily accomplished. However, the Finance Department has only allocated 30,000 yuan to date, and both funds and materials are lacking, leaving them helpless. Therefore, during the ice run, the breach was further enlarged by ice floes. Originally, only 20% of the water flowed through the breach, but now 60% flows through it, with a depth of twelve feet, taking nearly two-thirds of the main current. The River Affairs Bureau has estimated the cost for a second time, requiring 119,000 yuan to close the breach, but the Finance Department has not yet allocated the funds, so work cannot begin. In the blink of an eye, the peach blossom floods will rise again, and there is fear of repeating last year's failures, making it impossible to close the breach. This is the dangerous situation of the Hu dike project. Furthermore, according to the River Affairs Bureau's usual practice, during the spring low water, the entire river's dikes and dams are repaired to prevent floods and breaches, known as "Spring Repairs." This is not only precautionary but also achieves twice the results with half the effort. In the seventeenth year, Zhang Zongchang was defeated and fled, followed by the Jinan Incident. In the spring of the eighteenth year, the Jinan Incident was not yet resolved, and the Provincial Government had not yet moved to Jinan, resulting in the complete neglect of Spring Repair projects for two years. All the river's dikes are riddled with holes, causing dangerous conditions. The River Affairs Bureau has repeatedly appealed, but the funds for Spring Repairs have not yet been issued. Four representatives of the disaster victims in Lijin came to Jinan the day before yesterday to petition the Provincial Government, Finance Department, and River Affairs Bureau, detailing the dangerous situation downstream. Yesterday, the Provincial Government Standing Committee approved the River Works Committee to review the funds for closing the breach at Hujiatan and the funds for repairing Spring Repairs. After review, the Finance Department will allocate funds to close the breach. However, although the River Works Committee is the superior authority of the River Affairs Bureau, it has not held a meeting for several weeks. If it is necessary to wait for the committee to meet and approve, or to re-estimate the project at Hujiatan, before issuing funds, then the time will be too long, and the water will not wait. The people of several downstream counties will truly suffer the disaster of being fish. (28th)</p>
<h3 id="e78">The Shanxi Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters are Sealed <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The Minguo Daily and Jinxin Bookstore are also Searched</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The Shanxi Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters and the Minguo Daily office were searched by a joint force of military police and constabulary around 5 PM the day before yesterday (the 22nd). According to official statements, the reason for this action was that there were abnormal activities within the Party Headquarters. However, according to my understanding, it was due to the discovery of a large number of propaganda materials in the city the day before, containing absurd and outrageous mentions of Yan Xishan and others. The authorities believed that these materials were produced by the Party Headquarters, hence this action. The search of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Municipal Party Headquarters, Minguo Daily office, and Jinxin Bookstore, which prints the Minguo Daily, was carried out simultaneously. The Provincial Party Headquarters was guarded by a battalion of garrison soldiers and many police and constables. The other locations each had between forty and fifty or more than a hundred personnel, armed with live ammunition, assisting in the operation. The supervisors and committee members of the Provincial Party Headquarters had either gone to Beijing beforehand or had gone into hiding, leaving only a few staff members inside. The department's disciplinary team initially closed the main gate, intending to refuse the inspection. However, the garrison soldiers moved several machine guns and aimed them at the Party Headquarters' gate, with boxes of ammunition. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the disciplinary team agreed to disarm themselves, collect the weapons, and then open the gate. Immediately afterward, they left empty-handed. The military police and constables outside entered the Party Headquarters and immediately began surveillance. At the Municipal Party Headquarters, there were no complications. The military police allowed all staff members to take their luggage and move out that evening. All documents and equipment were temporarily guarded by the military police. The search of Jinxin Bookstore was quite strict, with the entire area surrounded, cutting off all internal and external communication. All propaganda materials were temporarily placed in one location. At the Minguo Daily office, only editor Wang Ying, a Mr. Lan, and business manager Dong Jingru were present at the time. The others had not yet arrived because it was still early. The publication was suspended from that evening. Around 5 PM yesterday, the General Headquarters and Special Party Headquarters dispatched Wang Gaisen, Liu Hanlin, Xia Guozhen, and three others to take over the Provincial Party Headquarters, Municipal Party Headquarters, and Minguo Daily, respectively, sealing and securing all documents and items. The detained personnel were also released. However, soldiers continued to guard the four locations. As for the branch offices and joint offices of various cities, counties, and districts, they have already erected signs at No. 3 Haizi Edge and have begun operations. The association and the Special Party Headquarters have been unusually active in recent days. The aftermath of the Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters will be resolved at the citizens' assembly. Recently, students from various schools have organized revolutionary youth groups, and slogans are posted all over the streets, with leaflets flying like snowflakes, seemingly ending the previous period of silence.

<h3 id="e79">Zhu and Mao Flee and Disrupt the Guangdong Border <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Nankang and Dagan on the Jiangxi Border Have Been Occupied by Bandits</p>
<p>Guangdong Training Regiment Heads to Nanxiong for Defense</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The remnants of the Communist bandits Zhu and Mao in southern Jiangxi have recently taken advantage of the local emptiness to harass in all directions. They previously attacked Ganzhou and were repelled by the Jiangxi army. One group of Communist bandits fled to Shangyou, and another group fled south again, passing through Nankang, with the intention of crossing the Dagan Mountains and eyeing Nanxiong in northern Guangdong. Because Nankang County had no defending troops, the bandits were able to drive straight in. It is reported that on the 20th, Nankang fell to the bandits, and the bandits took the opportunity to invade south, taking the route of Xincheng, Chijiangwei, and Qinglongwei, directly to Nan'an (i.e., Dagan County). Nanxiong in Guangdong is only one hundred and twenty li from Dagan. Local organizations and groups in that area have been sending urgent telegrams for days. (1) The Nanxiong Chamber of Commerce telegraphed, saying that Zhu and Mao's large forces have successively captured counties on the Jiangxi border and are approaching Nanxiong. Jiangxi Province has dispatched troops to pursue and suppress them. The bandits have nowhere to retreat and will inevitably flee to Nanxiong. They request immediate dispatch of troops to assist them day and night, and kindly request a telegraphic reply. (2) The magistrate of Shixing County telegraphed, stating that according to reports, Communist bandits are fleeing to Nan'an, eyeing Nanxiong. The county is preparing to meet them. They request assistance. (3) The magistrate of Nanxiong County telegraphed, saying that according to confirmed reports, Zhu De's Communist bandits set out from Nankang in two routes, one from Shangyou and Chongyi, and the other from the main road. It is said that they have arrived at Xincheng and are fleeing towards Dagan. It is found that Xincheng is only sixty li from the Guangdong border, and there are no troops to defend along the way. Nanxiong is in extreme danger. He urgently requests the prompt urging of the 63rd Division's training regiment to assist day and night. Nanxiong County Magistrate Mei Yiqiang bows and begs. After receiving repeated urgent telegrams, the authorities have received further warnings, stating that Dagan and Xinfeng counties were captured by bandits on the 23rd, with the intention of crossing the Dagan Mountains and entering Nanxiong in Guangdong Province. Businesses in Nanxiong have sent telegrams to Shaoguan and Guangzhou, stopping the dispatch of goods. Wealthy residents of Nanxiong City are even moving their families. Yesterday, the authorities have transferred Wu Wenxian, the chief of staff of the 63rd Division, to lead the division's new recruits training regiment to Nanxiong to coordinate with the local military police to strictly defend.

<h3 id="e80">Communist Bandits in Western Fujian Flee and Capture Yongfu <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Newly Organized First Division Has Sent Troops to Suppress Them</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The local Communist bandits in western Fujian recently concentrated in Longyan, led by Communist leader Deng Zihui. On the 22nd, they captured Hexi. The local Communist bandits stationed in Baihe, led by Fu Bocui, attacked Xiepu camp on the 22nd. After the Baihe militia led by Zhan Jifu and the Fifth Security Brigade led by Liu Liebo resisted with all their might, the Communist bandits retreated to Baisha in the evening. On the morning of the 23rd, Deng Zihui led about 2,000 Communist bandits from Hexi and Baisha towards Yongfu, which belongs to Zhangping County. At dawn on the 24th, they suddenly attacked Yongfu. The garrison only had 200 soldiers of the Security Brigade under Xiao Jiwu. They were caught off guard and vastly outnumbered. Xiao's troops were disarmed of over a hundred, and Xiao was also captured. Yongfu was thus captured. Xiao was subsequently burned to death by the Communist bandits. Yongfu is only eighty li from Zhangping County. After the Communist bandits entered the town, they looted and levied funds. Most of those with some assets fled. On the 25th, Deng sent over a hundred Communist bandits to occupy Guantian, which is twenty li from Hua'an County, and cut off the telegraph lines. When the Communist bandits captured Hexi, the Newly Organized First Division of Zhangzhou immediately sent a battalion of troops to join the soldier battalion and security team of Jinshan to recover Hexi on the 24th. On the 25th, they transferred two battalions of Chen Linrong's Third Regiment to advance towards Nan'an to suppress the Communist bandits in Hexi and to attack Yongfu from the rear. They also transferred all of Huang Kesheng's Fourth Regiment to advance towards Zhangping via Punan. It is said that one part of Huang's regiment has already set out, and the advance troops have arrived in Hua'an. This route is the main force for suppressing the Communist bandits in Yongfu. With such strong forces on both routes, it should not be difficult to eliminate them. On the 27th, Yang Fengnian, the Second Brigade Commander of the First Division, Lin Xuezeng, the Magistrate of Longxi County, and Zhu Peihuang, the director of the Longxi 指委, convened a joint meeting of party, government, and military representatives at the county party headquarters to discuss the prevention and suppression of bandits and the maintenance of public order. Zhangzhou has been under martial law since the 25th. (March 28th)</p>

<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Qian Zongze, the director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, after going to Zhengzhou to take over the bureau, went to Beijing to report to the Ministry of Railways. The bureau originally intended to remain in Zhengzhou and not move, to avoid confusion. However, due to changes in the situation in the Northwest, the Bianzheng trains have been interrupted. After Qian returned to Xuzhou from Zhengzhou this time, he immediately requested and received approval from the Ministry of Railways to temporarily move the Longhai Railway Bureau to Xuzhou for convenience. The personnel from the Zhengzhou bureau have already come to Xuzhou separately. The newly appointed officials in Xuzhou have also arrived at the bureau. The bureau is located at the Longhai North Station. Qian appointed Yan Zuolin as the chief secretary, and he began working on March 27th. The bureau is divided into five departments: General Affairs, Accounting, Transportation, Mechanical Engineering, and Civil Engineering. Yu Shibin is the director of the General Affairs Department, which includes the Document Section, headed by Yi Weicheng; the Translation Section, headed by Lu Dezheng; the General Affairs Section, headed by Qian Ziyuan; and the Materials Section and Police Section, for which the heads have not yet been determined. The Mechanical Engineering Department is temporarily headed by Chief Engineer Lin Yi, and the Civil Engineering Department is temporarily headed by Chief Engineer He Xianhua. The director of the Transportation Department, a French national, is still in Zhengzhou and has not yet arrived. Huang Zhaoxiang has been appointed as the deputy director. The head of the Accounting Department has also not been determined. It is said that they must be recommended by the French and Belgian banking groups. Each department is further divided into sections, which are currently being organized and established.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Twists and Turns in the Future of the Sino-Soviet Conference <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Mo Dehui Will Have Difficulty Departing on the 10th</p>
<p>Soviet Russian Personnel Do Not Discuss This Matter</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence, March 24th: It was rumored a few days ago that Mo Dehui had telegraphed the central government, stating that he was scheduled to go to Russia on April 10th and convene the Sino-Soviet conference in Moscow on the 15th. Regarding this matter, I visited relevant parties today, who claimed that this was not the case, and Mr. Mo had not telegraphed the central government regarding a firm departure date. It is also heard that the true intentions of Soviet Russia have not yet been clearly expressed. Even the director of the Russian consulate and the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau in Harbin does not discuss this matter. Therefore, the Russian attitude towards the conference is difficult to grasp. If their consent is not obtained in advance, there is no reason to go rashly. As Mo Dehui is in a position of full authority, he should not directly express any opinions to the Russian side, lest the Russian side develop a sense of contempt. Therefore, it is necessary for the newly appointed special envoy for diplomacy in Harbin, Zhong Yu, to formally notify Russia after his arrival, and only after obtaining a reply from the Russian side agreeing to it, can Mr. Mo set out. However, Zhong Yu sent a letter to his friend in Harbin yesterday, stating that due to discussing matters with Chairman Zhang (Zuoxiang), he would need to come to Harbin at the end of the month to take office. Only after Zhong arrives in Harbin at the end of the month to negotiate with Russia and everything is in order, will Mr. Mo be able to depart in half a month. Therefore, Mr. Mo's originally scheduled departure on April 10th will likely be postponed again. Of the two attendants assigned by the central government, except for Tu Wei Zeng, who has already arrived in Harbin, Li Chen is still in Hangzhou. Due to these various issues, Mr. Mo's trip to Russia will not be easy to realize in the short term. It is vaguely heard that key Russian figures in Harbin have indicated to third parties that the Soviet Russian side has not received the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs' declaration on the Sino-Soviet conference. If the conference is convened in the future, the commercial treaty and navigation rights must also be proposed. Judging by their intentions, it seems that they still do not want to deal directly with our central government, do not recognize and accept our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' declaration, and want to use the difficult issues of proposing commercial treaties and navigation rights as a plan to delay the conference. As for Mo Dehui's statement to people that if the Sino-Soviet conference can be convened, in addition to discussing the Chinese Eastern Railway issue in accordance with the central government's declaration, navigation rights and commercial treaties will not be mentioned, in order to comply with the central government's diplomatic intentions.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Second Court Hearing of the Gao Ying Appeal Case <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Result is Further Investigation of Evidence from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>The appeal case of Gao Ying and his wife was heard once by the Jiangsu High Court last winter. Because it was still necessary to transfer the case to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for investigation of evidence from San Francisco, the procedure was more time-consuming, and Gao and Liao requested an extension due to childbirth, resulting in a delay of many days. Only today (the 1st) was the second court hearing held. At 1 PM, people from all walks of life arrived in droves to observe, totaling more than 290 people, with women accounting for about 40%. At 2 PM, the Presiding Judge Huang Bingdao, Judges Zhao Zhengzhang and Zheng Zhiguo, Prosecutor Sun Xiyan, and Clerk Qin Qijun entered the courtroom and took their seats. At the same time, Gao Ying, Gao Liao, and Sun Yuan were brought to the court. Gao Ying's lawyers, Liu Shifang and Wang Youling, and Sun Yuan's lawyer, Hu Zhen, also appeared in court. After Judge Huang asked the three people their names and ages, he ordered Sun Yuan and Gao Liao to retire to the side seats. Prosecutor Sun Xiyan stood up and stated that the reasons for the appeal had been explained during the last court hearing and would not be repeated. At this point, Judge Huang began the interrogation.</p>
<p>First, interrogate Gao Ying: Judge (Q): When you were the consul in San Francisco, did Gao Liao bring eleven pieces of luggage when she returned to China from the United States after her first trip? Gao (A): There were fourteen pieces in total. (Q): Did all fourteen pieces of luggage have seals? (A): No seals. (Q): An investigation has been conducted with the Chinese consulate in San Francisco, and photos have been sent back. The luggage clearly has seals on it. You can take a look. (The judge handed Gao the photos for review, totaling three. The first showed eleven pieces of luggage with seals, the second showed three pieces of luggage without seals, and the third showed one of the eleven pieces of luggage with seals. These photos were taken in San Francisco.) (Q): Are these seals from the consulate? (A): No. (Q): Then where did these seals come from? (A): They were probably from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Q): Were they issued to the consulate by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? (A): No. (Q): Even if the seals are from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, does your consulate have seals? (A): The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has seals, but the consulate does not have seals. (Q): Does the embassy have seals? (A): It also does not have seals. (Q): According to you, do our Chinese embassies in the United States not have seals? Do their luggage not need seals when they come and go? (A): They do not need seals. (Q): Of the fourteen pieces of luggage that Gao Liao brought, were three pieces her own, and the other eleven pieces were brought on behalf of others? (A): Yes. (Q): According to the photos sent by the San Francisco consulate, all fourteen pieces of luggage have seals. (At this time, the judge showed Gao Ying the photos again, saying that there were seals on eleven pieces of luggage in the photos.) (A): These are not seals. Even if they are seals, I did not know about them in the United States beforehand. I cannot forge seals. (Q): You just said that the luggage did not have seals, but the photos clearly show seals. Since you say there are no seals, where did these seals come from? (A): The luggage was sent from China. I was not in China. Perhaps these seals were affixed in China. As for where they came from, I do not know. (Q): Do the several people named Shen Guang and others exist? (A): Yes, they exist, but I do not know them. (Q): They sent letters to your consulate. How can you not know them? (A): I certainly</p>
<p>do not know them. Now I have evidence to present in rebuttal. The judge ordered him not to present it and ordered him to step down.</p>
<p>Next, interrogate Gao Liao: Judge (Q): You did not accept the judgment of the Jiangning District Court, so you came here to appeal. Are the reasons for the appeal the same as before? (A): Yes. (Q): Did you have eleven pieces of luggage when you went from China to San Francisco? (A): There were fourteen pieces in total, three were my own, and eleven were brought on behalf of others. (Q): Were the eleven pieces entrusted to you by Chen Sheng? (A): Yes. (Q): Did all fourteen pieces of luggage not have seals on them? (A): No, my own three pieces did not have seals. (Q): Did the other eleven pieces have seals? (A): I did not see them at first. I only saw them on the ship later. (Q): How could you not see the things that people entrusted to you? And when the luggage is loaded onto the ship, you need to fill out a customs declaration form, and you must inspect the items. How could you not see them? (A): I did not see them at that time. (Q): When you declared customs, were all fourteen pieces filled out together? (A): They handled it, not me. That's why I didn't see the seals. (Q): Now the San Francisco consulate has already sent photos. The luggage you brought at that time clearly had seals. (He immediately showed her the photos for review.) After Gao Liao reviewed them, (A): My luggage is not in these photos. (Q): Is your luggage not among these fourteen pieces? Then is all that is shown in these photos not your luggage? (A): These eleven pieces were all entrusted to me to bring. (Q): Where is your own luggage? (A): My own three pieces were taken away at that time. (Q): It is true that these eleven pieces have seals, right? (A): Yes. (Q): Where did these seals come from? (A): I don't know. (Q): Would you not know about the luggage you brought yourself? (A): They wrote to me and asked me to bring it, so I don't know. (Q): Gao Ying said that these seals came from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Do you know about it? (A): I don't know. (Q): Are you four</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>going to the United States in April? (A): No, I went in June. (Q): Did you not go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get seals when you went? (A): No. (Q): Does the consulate have seals? (A): No. (Q): Are there seals from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the consulate? (A): Also no. (Q): Where do the several people named Shen Guang live in Hong Kong? (A): I don't know. (Q): What about Chen Sheng? (A): I don't know either. (Q): Last time you said he lived on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai, but you didn't know where on North Sichuan Road he lived. Now we have already asked the Shanghai Provisional Court to investigate. Because North Sichuan Road is very long, they couldn't find him either. Do you know the street number where he lived? (A): I don't know.</p>
<p>Next, interrogate Sun Yuan: Judge (Q): Have you been at the San Francisco Consulate for many years? (A): Yes, seventeen years. (Q): Did the consulate originally have seals from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? (A): No. (Q): Did the consulate have its own seals? (A): Also no. (Q): Are there any in the embassy? (A): I'm afraid not, I haven't seen them. (Q): Are the seals from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from before 1927, or are they from the National Government after 1927? (A): There are also no seals from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in the consulate. (Q): Since there are no seals, the San Francisco consulate has sent photos, and the luggage at that time had seals on it. Take a look. After Sun Yuan reviewed them, (A): These are not seals. (Q): Then what are they? (A): I'm not sure. (Q): You see, these are also not seals from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? (A): I don't know. (Q): Since there are no seals in the consulate, it can be seen that they were obtained from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (A): I don't know. (Q): Do the four people named Shen Guang live in Hong Kong? (A): I don't know. (Q): They clearly have letters to you. If you don't know them, why do they have letters to you? (A): I certainly don't know them. (Q): According to their letters to you, the four people named Shen Guang said that they have dealings with the Guangdong Bank in Hong Kong. We have now investigated the Guangdong Bank in Hong Kong, and they replied that there are no account holders with these names. At this point, the judge had the documents from the Guangdong Bank in Hong Kong, transferred by the Guangzhou Court, given to Sun Yuan for review. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Chinese Representative's Speech Expressing Hope for Cooperation in Eradicating Narcotics</p>
<p>Geneva News: The current session of the International Opium Committee was held from January 20 to February 14, 1930, at the secretariat of the League of Nations International Federation in Geneva. Official representatives from the governments of twelve countries, including China, Germany, France, Great Britain, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Yugoslavia, Siam, and Switzerland, attended the meeting. The United States government sent non-official representatives to observe. The Executive Yuan assigned three specialized assistants, Mr. Henri Brenier, Mr. L. A. Lyal, and Mr. H. E. Snks. The representatives from various countries were all familiar faces from previous sessions, except for the Japanese representative Mr. Sato, who was replaced by Mr. Ito due to the London Naval Conference. In addition to the representatives and specialized assistants from various countries, when discussing the issue of private trafficking in opium and narcotics, the committee invited Mr. T. W. Russel Pasha, the police chief of Cairo, to attend the discussion on the situation in Hungary. A representative from the Hungarian government also attended. At the first meeting, Mr. W. E. van Wettum from the Netherlands was elected as the chairman, and Mr. Gastan Pourgois from France was elected as the vice-chairman. The chairman expressed his welcome to the newly appointed Chinese representative, Mr. Wu Kaisheng. The following is a record of Mr. Wu's speech at the meeting:</p>
<p>Chairman, the report submitted by the Chinese government to the Advisory Committee on the Traffic in Opium this year contains a summary of 1928. This is one of the important tasks in opium control. At the first to third meetings, our country's representatives had already expressed the determination of the Chinese National Government to strictly prohibit opium and other narcotics. Today, I can tell you that this determination has been put into practice. Please read this year's report. It can be seen that the new opium prohibition regulations promulgated on September 10, 1928, clearly express the Chinese intention to prohibit opium in these regulations, so there is no need for me to elaborate. You all have many years of experience and deeply understand the difficulty of prohibiting opium and other narcotics. The Chinese government, in view of this difficulty, in addition to revising the existing laws, is also engaged in great reforms in the administrative field to respect the teachings of the late Generalissimo, who said: "To achieve the goal of opium prohibition, the National Government must adopt a nationally consistent plan." In the past, only because of the influence of the domestic political situation, the government was unable to make active reforms. As political stability was achieved, the National Government studied the situation at that time and specially organized a National Government Opium Prohibition Committee in 1928, which exercised the highest authority to handle opium prohibition matters. The members of the committee are selected by the National Government and the Military Affairs Commission, such as military commanders from various regions, relevant ministers in charge of opium prohibition affairs, and representatives from the National Anti-Drug Association. According to Article 2 of the National Government Opium Prohibition Committee Charter, its main functions are to receive orders from the National Government, supervise and be responsible for strictly prohibiting opium throughout the country, and to investigate opium prohibition and report to the government, which are also the responsibilities of the committee. In addition to handling administrative affairs, the National Government Opium Prohibition Committee also pays close attention to education and cooperates with anti-drug associations organized by the people in various regions, as suggested by the League of Nations General Assembly. The China Anti-Drug Association has now expanded its organization and spread throughout the country, and its development is truly amazing. The National Government Opium Prohibition Committee has not been established for long, and its ultimate success can also be predicted. As for the problem of prohibiting opium smoking, although there were many obstacles in the past, we can happily announce that we have gradually achieved satisfactory results. It should be known that the evil habit of opium smoking will be gradually eliminated due to the joint efforts of the government and the people. However, it is regrettable that illegal smuggling and the use of opium to manufacture narcotics have increased compared to before. Most of China's toxic drugs are smuggled in from various countries. Whether the National Government's opium prohibition efforts can succeed depends entirely on whether the smuggling of these toxic drugs can be stopped. I am not shifting responsibility to others, but I must announce to all countries that they should cooperate sincerely with each other. The Chinese government has long expressed its goodwill and determination. Today, the people of the whole country continue to work hard to find ways to prohibit toxic drugs. I say this in the hope that all countries will cooperate in a spirit of cooperation and work together to promote it.</p>

<p>Robbery of a Coffin Occurs in Nanxiang: At the Zha Creek funeral home in Nanxiang, the coffin of a deceased woman surnamed Zhou was stolen and broken open on the previous occasion (the 30th). The corpse's burial clothes and jewelry were completely stripped away. It was discovered by someone yesterday morning. The family reported it, and the case was forwarded to the Public Security Bureau, which is strictly investigating it. It is rumored that the stolen jewelry is worth as much as eight or nine hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Public Decision on Formaldehyde Alcohol Verification: Seven or eight out of ten wine merchants in this county mix formaldehyde alcohol. At the end of last month, the County Public Security Bureau discovered twenty urns of formaldehyde alcohol and five hundred urns of tax-evading old wine at the newly opened Zhou Zhenxin winery in Ximen. In addition to handing over the tax-evading old wine to the Public Sales Bureau for punishment according to law, all the formaldehyde alcohol was stored in the county government. Now, County Magistrate Chen has summoned various public institutions to decide on a solution at the county government at 10:00 a.m. today (the 1st). It was decided that a small bottle would be drawn from each urn in public and sent to experts for verification. If it is indeed formaldehyde alcohol, it will be severely dealt with according to law.</p>

<p>Handling of Household Registration Donation: The household registration donation in this county, originally called the "house number fee," was resolved by the second local council last year to levy one jiao to cover the costs of clearing the countryside. Later, due to insufficient budget, it was proposed to add two jiao in the first administrative meeting. Later, because the "Regulations for Clearing the Countryside" had not been promulgated, it was not implemented. In terms of defense, the county police team was勉qiang(reluctantly) allocated according to districts, but it was only one squad per district, which was often felt to be weak. Since the robbery in Ruan Lane occurred, rumors have become more prevalent. Therefore, the county government meeting changed the original proposal to "household registration donation" to be used to establish a temporary police team. It was then submitted to the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments for instructions that the county should establish a temporary police team. The method was concise, and the required funds had already been discussed to be collected through household registration donations, which was also acceptable. It was also submitted to the Provincial Government Meeting for approval and compliance. However, after the garrison troops were transferred to other places last month, the defense became even more vulnerable, and the local people were frightened and requested the opening of the project. Therefore, the county government ordered the first district chief to draft collection methods and immediately established a detachment to increase its strength. It is now known that the case has been instructed by the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments, stating, "The case was submitted by the Provincial Government No. 1288, and this Department submitted that the county should collect household registration donations for four months, one jiao per household per month, as temporary police team funds. It was ordered that the case be submitted to the Government Committee for the 1170th meeting, and it was decided to approve it. You should immediately inform the county magistrate to comply with this order, etc." Upon receiving this, it was found that the case had been submitted by the county before, and it had been forwarded and instructed as the situation warranted. Now, due to the previous reasons, it is necessary to instruct the county magistrate to comply with this order. Therefore, County Magistrate Hong has publicly recorded the order today and issued a notice for compliance.</p>
<p>Additional Notes on Robberies in the Four Townships: The trend of robbery in this county has been slightly reduced since the police team successively cracked down on a large number of bandit dens. However, multiple robbery cases have occurred again this month, such as the Zhang surname in the 48th Tu and the robbery case on the Shaji Road of Fahua Bridge. Last night, the home of Lu Caigen in Baiyun Temple was also robbed of clothing and more than two hundred yuan in cash. In addition to sending personnel to investigate, the county has ordered the water and land police teams to arrest the suspects together.</p>

<p>Disputes After Divorce Judgment: Chen Yunyu, a student at an adult women's school, married Yang, who lived outside Dongmen, nearly six years ago. The couple had a good relationship. However, her husband worked at a pawnshop in Shanghai, and his elderly mother had a mental illness. Family affairs were usually managed by his unmarried eldest daughter. The sisters-in-law did not get along. Last year, due to a tenant issue, Yunyu was forced to leave home and began studying at the school. Her family then sent a letter to her brother to return home, accusing Yunyu of "disobeying her mother-in-law" and "secretly fleeing with belongings." Her husband, without investigating, directly filed for divorce with the county government. After interrogation, it was found that the accusations were unsubstantiated, and the plaintiff lost the case. However, after the judgment, the couple lived together for several days. Ms. Yunyu even found her own belongings, such as children's hats, in her husband's sister's room, proving that they had been hidden and then falsely accused of being stolen. Her husband still returned to work in Shanghai, and another incident occurred at home. The matter was heard by the clan, who all disapproved of what the Yang family had done. Fearing an incident, they invited Ms. Yunyu to temporarily live at her aunt's house, waiting for her husband to return to Songjiang for mediation. Unexpectedly, the Yang family recently filed an appeal and secretly burned Ms. Yunyu's clothing and bedding. Ms. Chen has reported this to the Fourth District Police Station, which has dispatched police to investigate. She is also seeking justice everywhere. Those who hear about it sigh for her.</p>

<p>Crackdown on Profiteering Merchants Hoarding Food: The retail price of rice in Jiaxing has risen to 16 yuan per shi (a unit of dry measure), while traders are asking for 16.50 or 16.60 yuan. Rice merchants are requesting the評議會 (pingyi hui; council) to allow price increases due to capital losses. The council has decided that the current price is temporarily limited to 16 yuan and will not be increased. It will then submit a request to the county government, which will forward it to the Department of Civil Affairs, requesting that the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs allow Zhe省 (abbreviation of Zhejiang Province) merchants to purchase several tens of thousands of shi of rice and instruct rice merchants to purchase as much 洋米 (yangmi; foreign rice) as possible in Shanghai to provide relief. On the other hand, the county government has formulated five measures to crack down on profiteering merchants hoarding food and issued them to rice merchants for compliance: (1) Local merchants and wholesalers who hoard food with the intention of profiteering and obstructing the people's food supply will be dealt with according to these measures. (2) Local merchants and wholesalers should report the amount of grain stored each month to the county chamber of commerce, which will forward it to the county government for verification. If there is a case of underreporting, the remaining grain may be confiscated. (3) The grain stored by merchants should be sold to anyone who wants to purchase it at the market price and should not be refused. (4) If the grain stored by wholesalers is not sold for a long time, they should provide reasons and report them to the county chamber of commerce, which will forward them to the county government for verification. If the county government considers the reasons insufficient or deems it necessary to regulate local food supplies, it may order them to sell it at the market price. (5) Those who hoard food and refuse to allow purchases or refuse to comply with the county government's order to sell it may be punished or have their goods confiscated, depending on the severity of the circumstances.</p>

<p>Chairman Dai Jitao's Opening Address</p>
<p>Forge a Solid Physique</p>
<p>Cultivate a Strong Spirit</p>
<p>Chairman Dai Jitao said in his speech: "Only with a sound body can we have a sound mind. Only with sound citizens can we form a sound nation. And only with a sound nation can we create a sound culture. Looking at the past and present, spanning the universe, there has never been a case where a nation was weak and enervated, yet its culture could flourish and expand, or its nation could maintain its independence and survival. Before the revolution was complete and the nation was just beginning to be built, the central government deeply considered the lack of vigor in national physical education, which is the root cause of cultural decline and a means of inviting insults and causing chaos. Wishing to fundamentally change customs and establish a new foundation, it resolutely decided to hold a national sports meet. The site was selected in Hangzhou in April, and preparations were carried out for more than half a year. The sports-minded people of the country were delighted and danced with joy upon hearing the news, and they gathered to witness its completion. Various provinces and cities across the country selected and recommended outstanding talents who enthusiastically came to the meeting. From Hebei and Liaoning in the north to the Lingnan region in the south, and as far as the descendants of the Chinese nation overseas, more than 2,000 people will participate. The time is the transition between spring and warmth, a time when all things germinate. The location is Goujian's [of Yue] place of gathering and breeding, and Wu Su [of Wuyue] defended this place with self-improvement. It is a moment of vigorous striving that has lasted for a thousand years. Since the decline of military virtue, this is the first time that the entire country has gathered for a general competition. In ancient Athens, there was the Olympic Games. In our nation's golden age, there was also the system of hunting and military training. The people were accustomed to hard work, and their spirit soared to the heavens. The atmosphere of national revival was naturally different from that of later generations. With the decline of culture, physical strength gradually disappeared, and the physical body became thinner and weaker. This led to the deterioration of the people's morals, the darkening of the people's intellect, and the exhaustion of the people's livelihood, to the point where it could not be saved. Even selecting and nurturing seedlings and breeding species still requires artificial selection. How can we say that preserving the race and protecting the group does not require efforts to transform natural selection? Moreover, in modern physical education, concepts are constantly renewed, methods are constantly advanced, and regulations are detailed and meticulous. Every movement must be on course, which is how the laws of life are cultivated. The slightest deviation is fleeting. Superb skills are accumulated over time, so agility, diligence, and perseverance are essential. The loss of one person may mislead the group. One wrong action may affect the whole situation. This is how teamwork is practiced. Its effectiveness is not limited to increasing physical strength and improving the body. It will directly overcome the heavens and save the world. Sun Yat-sen said that modern warfare always sees weak countries as a problem, so peaceful nations need self-defense even more. If the mythical creatures qilin and wenhui had claws and teeth, how could eagles and tigers succeed? Our party upholds his teachings and firmly believes in his principles, which are to seek equality for the country and to achieve universal harmony in the world. It is especially important to develop national physical education as the foundation of the great cause of nation-building. I hope that from now on, this meeting will be held every year in different locations. The reputation it creates will spread from cities to villages, from schools to society, so that every household will make physical education a regular part of their lives, forging a solid physique and cultivating a strong spirit. Freedom from illness is true freedom. Fearlessness of the strong is true equality. A strong father will never have a weak son. Eugenics are the way to improve the breed. Then the nation will be healthy and strong, and the foundation of the country will be solid. Competition rules will become customs. Be upright, not deceitful. Compete without conflict. Protect what should be protected in terms of rights, and fulfill all obligations. The powerful and the inferior will not be able to deceive, and cunning and luck will be disdained. Then autonomy will have a solid foundation, and the rights of the people will be asserted. Those with full muscles will be diligent. Those with joyful spirits will enjoy their work. Do not seize what is not yours, and do not take what is unjust. Then the economy will be prosperous, and the people's livelihood will be secure. It is known that the governance of the country depends on the prosperity and decline of society. The prosperity and decline of society depends on the vigor and decline of the people's hearts. And the development of physical education is essential to stimulating the people's hearts and promoting the people's aspirations. This association has been ordered by the central government to gather these talented people, each displaying their unique talents, jointly setting a good example. I firmly believe that the future of physical education in our country will advance by leaps and bounds. The wind is bright, the banners are fluttering. Mount Wu stands tall, and West Lake is beautiful. Remembering the vastness of the rivers and mountains, we wish the country's fortune will be limitless. People of the whole country, why not come?"</p>

<p>Celebrate Boundless Progress</p>
<p>Vice Chairman Zhang Renjie delivered the welcome speech on behalf of Shi Weihuan: "The lake and mountains are warm in spring, and events are starting in this broad space. Distinguished guests have come to a magnificent gathering. Knowledge is imparted, skills are assessed, rewards are given generously, and national practices are demonstrated. Talents of the time are each giving their best. Kunwu [a sword] shines brightly, and Ganjiang [another sword] soars into the sky. Spirits are invigorated, and ambitions are raised. Success is achieved, preserving the race and strengthening the nation. I am untalented, bearing responsibility for my hometown. As the host, I have the honor of assisting in the affairs of the meeting. Many talented people have come, and I am immensely happy. I open my heart and embrace everyone, with wine, music, and song. I offer my sincere words, forming a short chapter. The foundation has been laid, and progress is boundless. This is a model for the whole country, and the glory of Zhejiang."</p>
<h3 id="e110">Director Zhu Jiahua's Speech on Preparations <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Reported that a Total of 185,500 Yuan in Donations were Received</p>
<p>Director Zhu Jiahua said in his speech: "Because I am busy with government affairs, I have had to rely on the help of the deputy directors. This place used to be the Sixth Division Garrison Headquarters. After it moved out a few months ago, we began to level the ground by two feet. The expenses were: 100,000 from Zhejiang, 10,000 from Jiangsu, 10,000 from Guangdong, 10,000 from Hubei, 10,000 from Hunan, 5,000 from Shandong, 3,000 from Anhui, 3,000 from Jiangxi, 3,000 from Shanghai, 3,000 from Hankou, 2,000 from Guizhou, 2,000 from Fujian, 1,500 from Qingdao, 1,000 from Liaoning, 1,000 from Henan, 500 from Heilongjiang, 500 from Jilin, and 20,000 from the central government, totaling 185,500 yuan."</p>
<h3 id="e111">Central Party Headquarters Shao Yuanchong's Address <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Strengthen the National Physique</p>
<p>Complete the National Revolution</p>
<p>Shao Yuanchong, representative of the Central Party Headquarters, said in his address that for thousands of years, China has only focused on writing and has paid no attention to the national physique or the national spirit. Therefore, whenever foreign forces come to oppress us, we are often unable to resist. In recent years, Western white people have used their scientific spirit, and the Chinese nation has shown its weaknesses everywhere. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen advocated the National Revolution, not only to restore the inherent culture and morality, but also to restore the inherent abilities and national spirit, to strengthen the Chinese national physique, and to complete the National Revolution. This National Games has been prepared for a long time, and it can be held today. If the general public can recognize the mission of this conference, the country will have hope. Modern national citizens compete entirely on knowledge and ability, and it is essential to have a strong physique to revitalize culture, morality, and national spirit. Furthermore, sports should be widespread among all people, so that society as a whole can be strong, in order to become the best nation in the world, to create a new culture, and to develop national character. I hope that all athletes will recognize this important responsibility.</p>
<h3 id="e112">National Government Chairman Chiang's Address <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The National Games is an Expression of Support for the Central Government</p>
<p>After the Speech, the Crowd Cheered "Long Live" Four Times</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang said briefly, "All members and chairmen of the National Games of the Republic of China, today we are holding the National Games here, and I will now report to you its meaning and mission. Our Chinese nation was the first to be civilized in the world, has a population of over 400 million, and occupies the first position in the world in terms of population. The land is also very vast. But what position does our country occupy in the world and in the international arena? Speaking of it is extremely shameful, but where does this great shame come from? It is caused by imperialists using various methods to oppress us. This National Games is an expression of the Chinese nation's demonstration against imperialism, an expression of an independent spirit, and also an expression against all warlords and reactionary forces within the country. This conference brings together the most outstanding and strongest citizens in the country in one place. In other words, it is an expression of unanimous support for the central government. Therefore, the meaning of this conference is not only to promote the national physique, but also to demonstrate against the imperialist warlords and reactionary forces in order to complete the National Revolution and build a country based on the Three Principles of the People, in order to wash away all past national humiliations. Today, on behalf of the National Government, I welcome athletes from all provinces and cities. From today onwards, I hope that you will continue to work hard in accordance with the mission of the conference." After Chairman Chiang finished his speech, he called out "Long Live the National Games," "Long Live the Chinese Nationalist Party," and "Long Live the Republic of China." The whole venue shouted, "Long Live Chairman Chiang."</p>
<h3 id="e113">Head Representative Yuan Lihun's Thank You Speech <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Expressed Gratitude to the Conference</p>
<p>Hoped for Supervision from the Central Government</p>
<p>Head representative Yuan Lihun said in his address, "Today is the opening day of the unprecedented National Games in China. I, as the representative of the participating units, express my gratitude to the Chairman of the Central National Government and representatives from all parties. The opening of this National Games has been attended by representatives from the central government and various parties, giving us many lessons. In addition to encouraging ourselves to invigorate our spirits, we also thank the Central Government's address. Not only will we strive hard this time, but we will continue to promote sports after we leave. We, the participating units, have come to Hangzhou, and we are deeply honored by the thoroughness of the facilities and the warmth of the hospitality. I, as a representative, thank the organizing committee. This time the meeting is held in Hangzhou, which is a scenic spot in the country. In addition to participating in the meeting, we can also stroll around the mountains and rivers and recuperate our physical strength. I thank those who proposed the Hangzhou Games, and I thank the gentlemen who helped. Because the central government has promoted it so much, the facilities are so complete, and the location is so beautiful, we feel very gratified and inspired. We hope that after this meeting, sports will develop from now on, and the spirit will be universally healthy. I hope that the central government will supervise, and we will continue to work hard."</p>
<h3 id="e114">Chairman Chiang's Second Address <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Entire Meeting is the Best Way to Strengthen the Nation</p>
<p>After all the athletes from the provinces and cities took the oath, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government delivered another address. He said briefly, "Athletes and comrades, I am afraid that my words just now were not very clear due to the strong wind. In order to express my full admiration, I would like to say a few more words to all athletes and comrades. Everyone is already very clear about the significance of holding this National Games, and the central government has even greater hopes for the National Games, because the foundation of the party and the country is the nation. If the nation is not strong, it will be invaded and encroached upon by foreign powers. The National Games is the best way to strengthen the nation. From this time on, the regions such as Kobe and Liaoning, which are far away, have been able to arrive on time to participate in the sports. This spirit is commendable. But in the face of the recent imperialist aggression and the oppression of warlord feudalism, I hope that everyone will use the spirit of participation to strengthen our bodies and rise up to fight," etc.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Wu Zhihui's Speech <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>We Must Be Civilized Citizens</p>
<p>Mr. Wu said briefly, "Today, it is not easy to gather athletes from all over the country in one place and hold such a grand sports meet. Originally, the strength or weakness of a country depends entirely on whether the national physique is strong or weak. Only with a strong nation can there be a strong country. The evolution of our population has a history of tens of thousands of years. Not only have we Chinese not evolved in terms of physique, but even our original physique has gradually degenerated, so that foreigners have given the name 'sick man of the East' to our citizens. I hope that all athletes will work hard from today onwards and be citizens of a civilized nation."</p>
<h3 id="e116">Wang Zhengting's Speech <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Conference is a Demonstration of the Spirit of National Unity</p>
<p>Hoped that the Delegation to the Far Eastern Games Would Achieve Final Victory</p>
<p>He generally said that the athletes had already heard many important speeches, so he didn't need to say much. However, he said that he was very happy to see so many athletes at this sports meeting. This sports meeting was initiated by Mr. Jingjiang [Zhang Jingjiang], and representatives from various provinces and overseas Chinese have come to participate. Therefore, Chairman Chiang said that the National Games can be regarded as a demonstration of the spirit of national unity. The Far Eastern Games will be held in Japan in May, so this conference can also be regarded as a preparatory meeting for the Far Eastern Games. I hope that the athletes who go to Japan will win glory for the motherland and achieve final victory, and promote the spirit of our nation.</p>

<p>Hoped for a Grand Sports Meet Every Year</p>
<p>Mr. Chu said that he was very happy to participate in the National Games today. Because this National Games is the first conference after the unification of the National Government, he has participated in many provincial sports meets before and felt that the spirit and facilities were not as good as this time. This National Games was initiated by Mr. Jingjiang, with the purpose of stimulating the inherent physical education. However, physical education should be paid attention to at all times. On the one hand, there should be competitions, and on the other hand, more attention should be paid to regular practice. It is not a good phenomenon to pay attention only during competitions. I hope that there will be a grand sports meet every year in the future, so that physical education will be universal, and the physique of the people will change from weak to strong.</p>

<p>Nine to Zero</p>
<p>A total of eleven teams joined the soccer competition in this tournament. The competition adopted an elimination system. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the tournament opened at the soccer field. As a result, the Tianjin team overcame the Anhui team with a score of nine to zero. The lineups of the two teams and the match situation are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Both Sides' Lineups <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Tianjin team launched fierce attacks on Anhui with its forwards. Both the left and right inside forwards were exceptionally lively. The Anhui team, on the other hand, was disorganized. Most of the balls kicked out were aimless, so they were always surrounded by the Tianjin team and had no chance of progress. As a result, the game was not exciting at all.</p>

<p>After the start of the game, the Tianjin team forwards immediately launched a fierce attack on the Anhui goal. Tianjin team's Bai Anxing dribbled the ball and crossed it, but center forward Zhang Changyu's shot was blocked. However, surrounded on all sides, left inside forward Sun Guilin finally kicked it into the net. Anhui suffered a heavy blow from this and tried to recover, but their strength was ultimately insufficient, and they produced no results. Afterwards, Tianjin team's left winger Bai Qingguo dribbled the ball as if he were in no man's land and lifted his foot to shoot. The ball was obtained by Zhang Changyu, who passed it to Sun Guilin, who easily kicked it in again. After that, the Anhui team's formation became even more chaotic. Finally, Sun Guilin of the Tianjin team scored two goals in succession. The first half ended with a score of four to zero in favor of Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Second Half: Five to Zero <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>After a five-minute break, the game continued. Not long after the start, Sun Guilin dribbled the ball straight in and scored another goal. This was only two minutes after the start of the half. At this time, the Anhui team's morale was even more shaken, and they missed every excellent opportunity. Afterwards, the ball was often in front of the Anhui team's goal, rarely crossing the halfway line. The Anhui team's goal became the target of everyone's attacks. Liang Jianwen also received assistance from the center forward and right winger and scored two goals. The eighth and ninth goals were both scored by center forward Zhang Changyu. Suddenly, the silver whistle sounded, and the game ended.</p>

<p>Two to Zero</p>
<p>Once the sides were decided, Zhejiang served first. They did not score. Tianjin scored five consecutive points with their first serve, with great momentum. Then Zhejiang also tried to attack and made the score two to five. However, in the end, due to the huge difference in strength, it was difficult to resist. When the Tianjin team was ahead with a score of eleven to five, they switched sides. Their momentum became even stronger, and soon they won the first game with a score of twenty-one to five. In the second game, the Zhejiang team was still unable to recover and lost again with a score of four to twenty-one. The Tianjin team won two games in a row and won the right to the next match. The lineups of the two teams are listed below. The referee was Li Feiyun.</p>

<p>First Sound: Tianjin Initially Shows Its Power</p>
<p>Strange Record: Jiangxi Almost Eats Dumplings</p>
<p>[A score of 153 to 4]</p>
<p>The tournament opened, and the basketball competition also began. Today's basketball program originally had three matches: Men's Shanxi vs. Anhui and Tianjin vs. Jiangxi, Women's Fujian vs. Shanghai. Later, since Shanxi and Fujian did not arrive, Shanghai and Anhui teams proceeded with a two-round competition. The Tianjin-Jiangxi battle started at 2:00 PM. This was the first act of the National Games basketball championship. Spectators flocked to the event, reaching over a thousand people. Referee Qian Yiqin and Inspector Shao Ji arrived at the venue and ordered the game to begin. Tianjin immediately took the offensive. In less than a minute, center Liu Jianchang scored a basket, opening the scoring. Not long after, Jiangxi had a free throw opportunity, and Hu Xianmei made one point, making the score two to one. Tianjin had many Nankai team members, and their exquisite skills were well known to people across the country. Most of Jiangxi's players were emerging athletes, and their skills were naturally slightly inferior. Tianjin forwards Tang Baokun, Yao Enhan, and Liu Jianchang passed the ball to each other, scoring repeatedly. Jiangxi was unable to fight back. Tianjin then replaced reserve players to continue the battle, but their momentum did not weaken at all. As a result of the first half, Tianjin scored 63 points, while Jiangxi only scored one point. After a ten-minute break, they switched sides and continued the battle. Tianjin's momentum was still strong. Jiangxi suffered a complete defeat. The final score was one hundred fifty-three to four, a difference of one hundred forty-nine points, a strange record unprecedented in the basketball world. Looking at the overall game, both teams gave their all in the battle. One side did not become arrogant because of their victory, and the other side did not become discouraged because of their defeat. Both sides fought to the end, and their perseverance and spirit were commendable.</p>

<p>Wang Chonghui: To the National Games, Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, Dai Jitao, He Jingzhi, Zhu Liuxian, and other gentlemen. Upon receiving the invitation to go to Hangzhou to observe the National Games, I very much wanted to go. Unfortunately, today I am going to Zhenjiang to supervise an oath-taking ceremony and cannot participate in the grand event. I am very sorry. I respectfully wish the sports meet great success in promoting and guiding the nation. Your brother, Wang Chonghui.</p>
<p>Chen Hexian: To National Games Chairman Dai, Vice-Chairman He: I was officially recommended by the Jiangsu Provincial Government to participate in the grand opening of the Games tomorrow. However, it coincides with the oath-taking ceremony for the new Jiangsu Provincial Committee and the heads of various departments, and I am unable to arrive in Hangzhou on time. I plan to go for sightseeing a day or two later. I hereby send this telegram for your understanding. Chen Hexian bows.</p>

<p>The National Games officially opened in Hangzhou yesterday. Shanghai, as one of the most important regions in the country, not only sent athletes to participate but also organized a delegation to attend the opening ceremony and assist the organizing committee in handling all matters. To show the importance of the delegation, the municipal government specifically appointed Chen Dezheng, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, as the Chief Representative. Mr. Chen went to Hangzhou the day before yesterday to attend as a representative. All business related to the Education Bureau will be handled on his behalf by Section Chief Ni Wenya.</p>
<p>The National Games is scheduled to be held in Hangzhou on April 1st. The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously resolved to officially recommend Director Chen of the Education Department to go to Hangzhou to attend the ceremony. Mr. Chen originally planned to go early, but the new Jiangsu Provincial Committee and the heads of various departments are scheduled to take office and swear oaths on that day, making it impossible to leave. Therefore, Mr. Chen has changed his plan to go for sightseeing after the inauguration and has already telegraphed Chairman Dai and Vice-Chairmen Zhang and He of the Sports Federation to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Yang Zhongming, the chief representative of Anhui Province, was originally the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Preparatory Office of the Central China Games. Due to the closing of the Preparatory Office, he was unable to accompany the athletes of the province. Mr. Yang took an express overnight trip to the East because of the opening of the Games and arrived late at night on the 31st.</p>

<p>Clothing: Athletes from all directions gather at this National Games, truly making it a grand occasion. The clothes usually worn by the athletes are colorful and very impressive. In addition to most wearing ordinary sports clothes, the female athletes from Liaoning wear violet sports caps and purple-red velvet shirts with blue trim, with dark blue serge trousers and shirts. The female athletes from Beiping wear black velvet shirts with red trim and black shirts and trousers. The female athletes from Qingdao wear blue cloth shirts and blue cloth skirts. The male athletes wear yellow velvet shirts and white trousers, and the male athletes from Hebei wear red velvet shirts and white trousers. The colors are all well-coordinated and very beautiful. In general, the colors of clothes in North China are very bright, while the clothes of athletes in Central China, such as Hunan, Henan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, are very simple. This alone is enough to show the psychology of clothing colors in the country.</p>
<p>Food: There are more than 3,000 athletes and staff members at the Games, making the issue of food very important. The organizing committee has contracted with the Bao Shi Kitchen Army for meals and has set a treaty to have lunch at 12:00 PM and dinner at 6:00 PM every day, simultaneously, without delay, to facilitate time. It is also stipulated that there are eight athletes per table, with four dishes, two bowls, and one soup, costing 20 cents per person. Staff members have six bowls and one soup, with six people per table, costing 20 cents per person. However, if the organizing committee opens meals at the same time, there is no such wide hall in the venue to accommodate the need for a big meal. Therefore, a large shed has been built, measuring eleven rooms wide and twenty rooms deep, with 240 tables and 960 benches, allowing for simultaneous meals. The sound of plates and bowls echoes. The four words "spectacular sight" are enough to describe such a large dining hall. On the first day of the meal, the northern athletes raised objections, because northerners prefer noodles and find it difficult to swallow white rice. The organizing committee also took into account the different habits between the North and the South, so the white rice for the northern athletes was changed to bread and large steamed buns for each meal.</p>
<p>Many slogans related to eating are posted in the large dining hall. They are recorded as follows: "Eating is 'group-oriented'," "Eat to your heart's content," "Buckle up and exercise," "Win the championship with a full stomach," "Neatness at meals can be seen in the neatness of exercise," "Chew while eating, do not speak." The use of slogans for eating is truly a first for the National Games.</p>
<p>All Instructors</p>
<p>Accommodation: The Games venue is located in Meidong Gaoqiao, originally an old barracks, covering an area of 300 acres. The venue is all open space, while the offices in the rear are in the barracks. Therefore, the athletes' dormitories are transformations of the barracks. There are three dormitories: the first is for women, and the second and third are for men. Each room in the first has 32 beds, with wooden frames in two layers, like upper and lower bunks on a ship, for a total of more than 2,000 beds. Each dormitory has two laborers to take care of everything. The women's dormitories are even more well-equipped. Each room has a piece of white cloth at the door as a screen, and there are 20 bathtubs, specifically for the female athletes to cleanse themselves. Nine female servants have been hired, one in charge of the pavilion, four as errand girls, and four to manage the bathroom. Two female receptionists have also been hired to handle reception matters. As for laundry and various other trivial matters, all equipment can be described as meticulous. However, some athletes, such as the athletes from Guangdong, feel that the beds in the dormitory are made of hardwood and are unwilling to endure it, so they all reside in the West Lake Hotel.</p>

<p>When the Games were about to open, the female athletes from all over could not help but have their hearts beating. Although they usually trained well, they were still worried about not being accurate, and even more so because of their vanity and competitive spirit, they practiced desperately. Some had lovers guiding them by their side, practicing volleyball in the square, their voices娇声引吭. Red and green clusters formed round shapes, like several hydrangea flowers laid flat. The spectators also almost felt as if they were in a flower bush.</p>

<p>Before the opening, boys and girls from elementary schools in Hangzhou gathered in the inner square of the preparatory office, with glowing spirits and innocent expressions. The boys and girls wore white caps, white cloth jackets, and blue bamboo cloth trousers. The girls wore blue bamboo cloth skirts. The colors were distinct, but at a glance, the upper bodies were all white and the lower bodies were all blue, making it difficult to distinguish male from female.</p>

<p>Honorary Chairman Chiang Kai-shek arrived at the meeting that day with his wife, Soong Mei-ling, with joy overflowing between their eyebrows. When the master of ceremonies announced the Chairman's speech, Chiang saw a photography stage in the middle of the venue, so he ordered to leave his seat and ascend the stage to give his speech. As the photography stage was not located in the center of the venue, the police and the audience moved it to the center. Chiang gracefully ascended, wearing a light yellow military uniform, looking high and far, reaching out in all directions, speaking and pointing, with a strong voice and spirit, which encouraged the athletes greatly.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Earnest Words <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>A broadcasting wireless machine was installed in front of the rostrum. When Chiang moved to the venue to give his speech, the machine was quickly moved and installed. By the time it was installed, Chiang had already finished speaking. After returning to the rostrum, after speeches by guests such as Wu Zhihui, Wang Zhengting, and Chu Minyi, Chiang was afraid that everyone had not fully understood his first speech, so he repeated it on the broadcasting machine, with thunderous applause.</p>

<p>The opening ceremony of the Games was held at the athletics field. In the middle of the field, a long pole was erected to hang flags. When the reporter entered the field at about 7:00, the Games staff were stacking prizes into a tower around the pole. There were no fewer than two or three hundred silver goblets and shields. It was said that this was only a quarter of the prizes.</p>

<p>Athletes from various provinces had arrived in Hangzhou ten days before the Games. Now that the Six Bridges and Three Temples were full of peach blossoms and green willows, the athletes went for a boat ride on the lake in their free time. Therefore, traces of athletes could be seen everywhere on the embankment and in the lake. However, the Games venue and its surroundings were not located in the city center, and people rarely visited there on weekdays. Now that so many athletes had suddenly come, the rickshaw pullers who stayed there took the opportunity to exploit them. The boatmen by the lake usually raised their prices for tourists, and now that it was springtime and the athletes had accents from other places, the boatmen ganged up to gouge them, so the daily rate for boat rides, which was usually one yuan, cost no less than two or three yuan these days.</p>

<p>The rest rooms for male and female athletes were clearly marked in the venue. Yesterday, after the athletics competition, three female athletes from Liaoning, feeling tired, lay down on the floor of the Liaoning male athletes' rest room. The male athletes next to them were either lying down or sitting on the floor. According to the traditions of the North, men and women, or guests, often lie together to keep warm and do not find it strange. Spectators passing by often stopped to watch.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Many Interesting Things at Night <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Last night, a female athlete from Shanghai, feeling idle, saw a rickshaw in front of the dormitory and impersonated a rickshaw puller, pulling it to the southeast corner of the field near the gate. A male athlete happened to be going out and shouted from afar, "Hey, rickshaw!" The female athlete deliberately made a funny gesture, speaking in her Shanghai accent, "Where to? Come, come!" When they got closer and looked at each other, they burst out laughing.</p>

<p>At the opening ceremony, there was initially a slight breeze, which then turned into a strong wind. When Chiang gave his second speech, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department took advantage of the wind to scatter leaflets, blowing them to the crowd like snowflakes, dancing wildly in the air. The leaflets urged the use of domestic goods, but the rostrum was also obscured by the flying catkins, making it difficult to see clearly. The police department immediately prohibited this and threatened to punish them for disrupting order, which was truly trying to be clever and making a mess.</p>

<p>The female athletes from various places all had short hair and short clothes, with their chests sticking out, giving the impression of strong warriors. However, Yin Linzhen, number 252 in volleyball, a female athlete from Shanghai, was short and petite, and still had a braid behind her, which had not been cut off, inevitably giving people a sense of incompleteness.</p>

<p>The soccer representatives for Japan for the third Far Eastern Games have already been selected. The main players are from the two teams of Tokyo University and Kwansei Gakuin University. Mr. Takekoshi is the coach and commander. Every day he leads vigorous practice sessions at the Jingu Stadium. Because Japanese soccer has historically been immature, in order to arouse the enthusiasm and effort of the players, a soccer players' motivational meeting was held at the Asahi Hall a few days ago. Sports expert Mr. Imamura delivered an earnest speech, hoping that Japanese players could keep pace with China. In order to promote soccer tactics, Japan will provide substantial rewards and preferential treatment to soccer players.</p>

<h3 id="e169">The Renaming and Methods for Chinese Medicine Schools <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health have submitted a request to the government and the Executive Yuan to change the names of Chinese medicine schools to Chinese Medicine Academies and to manage them according to the methods for managing academic groups, in accordance with the law. An order has recently been issued to the Education Bureaus of various provinces and special municipalities. The case involves Proclamation No. 8 issued by this Ministry last year, which changed Chinese medicine schools into training centers, and the Ministry of Health's order changing Chinese medicine hospitals into clinics, prohibiting Chinese medicine practitioners from using Western instruments and medicines. These cases have been submitted to the Executive Yuan, which has been informed by a letter from the Civil Affairs Office of the National Government that it has received an instruction from Chairman Chiang to revoke the aforementioned proclamations and orders, and to comply with the instructions. Upon receiving this instruction, we should respectfully adhere to Chairman Chiang's intention to protect Chinese medicine and comply with the instructions. Subsequently, in February of this year, this Ministry, together with the Ministry of Health, submitted a report to the Executive Yuan, detailing the circumstances of changing the names of Chinese medicine schools, allowing Chinese medicine practitioners to use Western instruments, and changing Chinese medicine hospitals into medical clinics. This Ministry proposed changing Chinese medicine schools into Chinese Medicine Academies, and the Ministry of Health proposed changing the names of hospitals, with better public Chinese medicine hospitals being called "Public Chinese Medicine Hospital of..." We requested that these proposals be forwarded to the National Government for review and compliance. Subsequently, the Chairman of the Executive Yuan, Zhu Jiahua, delivered an opening speech at the meeting.</p>

<p>The Executive Yuan has ordered that the proposed methods be implemented separately, adhering to the law while also embodying the intention to protect Chinese medicine. This has been forwarded for approval to facilitate implementation. Furthermore, we have received an order stating that the National Government has approved the instruction and ordered its implementation, in addition to separate orders to the Ministry of Health. Upon receiving these instructions, we should comply. Regarding the method proposed by this Ministry to change Chinese medicine schools into Chinese Medicine Academies, it is for the sake of improving Chinese medicine. We should conduct scientific research and improvements on existing academic knowledge and clinical experience, so that it gradually becomes a scientific discipline. Students studying Chinese medicine should first have this foundation before pursuing further studies. During this transitional period, Chinese medicine should move towards science and free research. Therefore, we specifically request that the organization of the place for researching Chinese medicine be called Chinese Medicine Academy, so that it can become an academic group and be managed according to the methods for educational administrative agencies managing academic groups. Hereafter, all Chinese medicine schools within the jurisdiction of the "Office" or "Bureau" should be instructed to change their names to Chinese Medicine Academies. All management methods should be implemented in accordance with the methods for educational administrative agencies managing academic groups. In addition to separate orders, we are hereby issuing an order for compliance.</p>

<h3 id="e171">The Two Courts of the Public Concession Established Yesterday <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Presidents and Prosecutors of Both Courts Take Office</p>
<p>Each Gives a Speech on Justice and Integrity</p>
<p>Representatives of the Party Hope to Eradicate Bad Habits</p>
<p>Yesterday Afternoon, Cases Accumulated by the Police Stations Were Heard</p>
<p>The Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Shanghai Special District Court were officially established yesterday at the original site of the provisional court on North Zhejiang Road. The presidents of both courts and the chief prosecutors of both courts, as well as all the prison directors, were sworn into office at the same time. Ma Shouhua, a director specially appointed by the Ministry of Judicial Administration, came to Shanghai to supervise the oath-taking ceremony. The detailed situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Court Arrangement: At the main entrance of the court facing North Zhejiang Road, the flags of the Party and the country are crossed. Above, a long wooden plaque reading "Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court" is hung, and below, a long wooden plaque reading "Shanghai Special District Court of Jiangsu" is hung. Both are in black characters on a white background. Above the main entrance hangs a white cloth banner reading "The World is for All". On both sides are white cloths written with the couplet "The Revolution Has Not Yet Succeeded" and "Comrades Still Need to Strive". The entrance to the main entrance is the registration office, with a signature book and several receptionists to receive guests. After signing in, the receptionists lead the guests to the reception room or auditorium on the second floor of the High Court branch.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Auditorium: The auditorium for the oath-taking ceremony is located in the second courtroom on the second floor of the High Court branch. In the center of the auditorium, a portrait of Sun Yat-sen and his will are hung, with the flags of the Party and the country crossed above, and the two characters "Auditorium" written on white cloth. There is also a banner with "The World is for All", and the couplet "The Revolution Has Not Yet Succeeded" and "Comrades Still Need to Strive". Oath Order</p>
<p>Photography of the Inauguration Ceremony of Presidents Xu and Yang (Taken by China Photo Studio)</p>
<p>Notable Guests: Among the guests, Pan Gongzhan was present from the Municipal Party Department, Su Fuchou from the Garrison Headquarters, Yu Hongjun from the Municipal Government, Guan Jiongzhi from the Stamp Duty Bureau, and Yu Qiaqing and Chen Bingqian from the business community. The largest number of guests were from the legal profession, including famous lawyers Chen Tingrui, Jiang Yiping, Wu Chengyu, Shen Yuesheng, Qin Liankui, Fan Gang, Qu Yue, and others. Female guests included Dr. Zheng Yuxiu and Mrs. Xu, and the daughter of Court President Hu. The hall was crowded with three or four hundred people.</p>
<p>Inauguration Ceremony: The inauguration was originally scheduled for 10 a.m., but due to various procedural delays, it was not until 11 a.m. that Presidents Xu and Yang, Chief Prosecutors Wang and Zhou, Prison Director Xie, and the presidents, judges, and prosecutors of the civil and criminal divisions of the two courts successively entered the auditorium. The master of ceremonies, Xiong Sipeng, called out according to the pre-arranged order: (1) The supervising officer takes the chair, (2) The president of the High Court branch, the chief prosecutor of the High Court branch, the president of the Special District Court, the chief prosecutor of the Special District Court, and the second prison director take their places, (3) The entire hall stands at attention, (4) The chairman respectfully reads the will, (5) Three minutes of silence, (6) The chairman presents the seals, (7) Oath-taking (the oath is recorded below), (8) Admonitory speech by the supervising officer, (9) Speech by the representative of the Party, (10) Speech by the guest, (11) Responses from the president and chief prosecutor (all speeches are recorded below).</p>
<p>Text of the Oath: I solemnly swear that I will恪恪恪遵 Sun Yat-sen's will, obey the Party's principles, abide by the laws of the nation, be loyal and diligent in my duties, and save expenses. I resolve not to hire useless personnel, not to engage in private gain or corruption, and not to accept bribes. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment from the Party. I swear. First, President Xu raised his right hand and respectfully read the above oath, and ordered all the prosecutors of both courts to follow him, each raising their right hand. Then, Chief Prosecutor Wang of the High Court, President Yang of the District Court, Chief Prosecutor Zhou, and Prison Director Xie each raised their right hand in turn and read the oath aloud.</p>
<p>Admonitory Speech by the Supervising Officer: Ma Shouhua, Director of the Ministry of Judicial Administration and supervising officer, gave an admonitory speech, stating in brief: Today is the day of the establishment of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Shanghai Special District Court, and it is also the day of the oath-taking ceremony for the presidents and chief prosecutors of both courts. I have been ordered by the Ministry of Judicial Administration to come here to supervise the oath-taking, and I would like to offer a few words and express my expectations. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has now entered the period of political tutelage, and construction is of utmost importance. The judicial authorities are working hard to protect human rights, and the establishment of the two courts is timely. Although their organization and powers are still limited by special circumstances, they are generally similar to purely Chinese courts. The unequal treatment that the people of the Special District have suffered in the past can be gradually eliminated, and the presidents and all the judges of the two courts are always honest and just, and can all do their best to abide by the law. I believe that they will surely live up to the wishes of the people of the Special District. However, at the beginning of this reform, I hope that they will work even harder to ensure that the property, reputation, and freedom of all the people in the Special District are fully protected by law. As for honesty and justice, these are well-known and easily practiced by all the presidents and prosecutors, and I need not elaborate further.</p>
<p>Speech by the Party Department: Pan Gongzhan, representative of the Special Municipal Party Department, gave a speech, stating in brief: Today, I am very honored to participate in this grand ceremony. I represent the Municipal Party Department and should offer a few words. I recall that a few months ago, I came here to attend the inauguration ceremony of President Xu as the president of the Provisional Court. At that time, I earnestly hoped that President Xu would overthrow all the distorted systems of the past decades, especially the last twenty years, and establish a court that fully conformed to the general legal system. Fortunately, the efforts of the various departments of the Central Government have made this hope a reality. Although there are still one or two points that cannot satisfy people's wishes due to environmental factors, they must be reformed gradually and cannot be achieved overnight. Now, the prison has been taken back and the three-trial system has been implemented. Other distortions will eventually be eliminated, and it is expected that those that cannot be satisfied can also be gradually improved. I hope that all the judges will work hard and be able to achieve their goals. We also believe that all the judges led by the presidents of the two courts will be able to fulfill their duties. Sun Yat-sen said that knowing is difficult, but doing is easy. Justice and integrity are well-known to judges, but sometimes they are not honest. This is because their will is weak, and they fall when they are tempted. Therefore, those who know must know thoroughly, so that they will not be swayed by the environment, and the people can receive just benefits. Shanghai is the easiest place to violate the law and lose one's personality and morals. I believe that the presidents of the two courts will be able to establish a good reputation and set an example here. Therefore, I have sincere hope for the presidents of the two courts and all the prosecutors to proceed with justice and integrity. There is also one point: the prosecutors and prison directors have always been honest and self-disciplined, but they cannot rely solely on the honesty of their superiors. All the staff must have a sense of justice and integrity in order to be effective. If you want your subordinates to be honest, you must strictly assess them. Otherwise, if only the superiors are honest, it will not alleviate the suffering of the people in litigation. Furthermore, if subordinates are deceived or obstructed in their work, and those who suffer have no way to complain, they can only swallow their anger and weep silently. Superiors will still not know the pain of the people. I am not usually good at flattery, but today I have the opportunity to congratulate the wise leaders on their inauguration, so I am fulfilling my responsibility to speak my mind. I hope that all the bad habits of the past can be completely eradicated. I have heard that there is a lot of corruption in prisons and detention centers. Prisons are still tolerable, but detention centers hold people who have not been convicted, and they also suffer, and they suffer without daring to complain, and without a way to complain. They only tell their relatives and friends after they are released, and never complain in public. I hope that after this reform, the wise leaders will pay attention to these small details, because those who can truly connect with the people are mostly subordinates. If you want to alleviate their suffering, you should strictly assess your subordinates, and strive to eliminate one thing at a time, and work hard one day at a time to achieve results. What I have contributed today is entirely on behalf of those who have suffered in prisons and detention centers, appealing to the wise leaders.</p>
<p>Speech by the Guest: Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, representing the Mayor of the Special Municipality, Zhang Qun, gave a speech, stating in general: The establishment of the High Court branch and the Special District Court gradually completes the judicial system in the Special District. From now on, I deeply hope that the court and the municipal government will fully cooperate so that the people can benefit, and I hope that it will become a model court for the whole country.</p>
<p>Summary of Responses: (1) President Xu of the High Court branch said in his speech: Today is the first day that the Shanghai Special District has formed a formal court. The officials of the two courts and the branch prison are taking office at the same time. The Party Department and the responsible department have given us earnest instructions. We should strictly abide by them. I personally have no opinion to express, but whether the officials of the two courts and the branch prison are qualified is not only related to local security and the rights of the people, but also has an impact on current and future diplomacy. I hope that my colleagues will abide by the law in everything they do, and that all sectors of society will uphold the law, so that the credibility of the court can be maintained, and the foreign policy that Sun Yat-sen has proclaimed will eventually be completely victorious. This is what I use to encourage myself, and I would like to share it with everyone present. (2) Chief Prosecutor Wang Zhennan of the High Court branch said in his response: I will sincerely accept the admonitory speech of the supervising officer of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the guidance of the representative of the Municipal Party Department, and the expectations of the guests regarding integrity. As for the current prosecutorial system and prosecutorial powers, I feel that there are still limitations in the agreement. In addition, I should strive to fully exercise my powers and work hard. (3) President Yang Zhaoyu of the Special District Court said in his response: The instructions of the representative of the Ministry of Justice, the guidance of the representative of the Party Department, and the opinions expressed by the guests should be regarded as golden rules, and it is especially important to abide by the law. I will encourage all the judges to do so. (4) Chief Prosecutor Zhou Xianjue of the Special District Court said in his response: The prosecutorial system in the Special District has just been established, and foreigners are initially unclear about it, causing many obstacles and preventing prosecutors from fully exercising their powers. We should work hard to eliminate foreigners' doubts, and integrity is what I have always upheld, and I should practice it in my own life.</p>
<p>Photography and Adjournment: The meeting adjourned at noon. The group went downstairs and sat in a semi-circle outside the main entrance of the court to take pictures. After the event, the guests dispersed, and Presidents Xu and Yang sat down again with the presidents, judges, and prosecutors of the two courts in turn, still in a semi-circle, to take another picture as a memento. When taking office in the auditorium, electric light photos were also taken three times. Everyone in the auditorium was startled by the loud noise.</p>

<p>Residing at the New Longhua Railway Station</p>
<p>Will Take the Original Special Train to Nanjing</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife of the National Government went to Ningbo and then to Hangzhou. Yesterday morning, they participated in the opening ceremony of the National Games, and then at 8:30 p.m. last night, accompanied by Finance Minister Song Ziwen, Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, German military advisor Fischer, and guards, they left Hangzhou for Shanghai by special train. The armored car Nanjing No. 1 led the way. They arrived at New Longhua Station at 0:30 this morning. Chairman Chiang and his wife and party stayed in the car and spent the night at the station. At 6:30 this morning, they left New Longhua Station and headed for the North Station. It is expected that after arriving at the North Station, they will take the original special train directly to Nanjing. However, their family members prepared a car this morning and waited for Chiang at the North Station. Upon learning of Chiang's arrival in Shanghai, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters deployed soldiers from the Fifth Division and spread out sentries in New Longhua, Xujiahui, Fanwangdu, and the North Station to provide all-night protection.</p>

<p>The rice market was still very tense yesterday. Only eight rice boats arrived at the south city riverbank, and only one of them came from Tongli. According to the investigation, there were fourteen boats of rice from Tongli arriving in port on the 28th of last month. In this situation, it is obvious that someone is manipulating the market. In addition, boatman Zhang Liandi had 120 piculs of Lian Tang Bo rice on board, which arrived in port on the 27th of last month and was docked at the new pier. As of yesterday, more than 90 piculs had not been sold, hoping for a good price. At a time of food panic, it is truly a scourge of the people's livelihood to engage in hoarding and price gouging. After receiving the report, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately convened the boatman and the dealer, Wanxing Rice Shop, to the bureau together with the Public Security Bureau to give them a warning. In the future, when rice boats arrive in port, they should be sold immediately without waiting or hoarding. It was also found that there were cases of waiting and not selling in the northern part of the city. The bureau also investigated and issued strict warnings at the time.</p>
<h3 id="e174">The Minquan Warship Held a Flag-Raising Ceremony Yesterday <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>And Established a Party Branch at the Same Time</p>
<p>The new Minquan warship of the Navy held a flag-raising ceremony at 8 a.m. yesterday. Male and female guests arrived one after another, about a hundred people. Then, Fleet Commander Chen Xunyong led the captains and adjutants of the various warships stationed in Shanghai to board the ship. Captain Luo led all the officers and men of the ship to stand at attention and greet them. Commander Chen represented the Navy Department in the ceremony. The order of the ceremony was as follows: (1) Stand at attention and sing the Party song, (2) Bow three times to the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, (3) The captain respectfully reads Sun Yat-sen's will, (4) Raise the flag, (5) Award the seal, (6) Commander Chen's speech, (7) Captain Luo sworn in, (8) Free speech, (9) End of ceremony, photography. Commander Chen inspected the enemy defense exercise. In an instant, the bugles sounded in unison, and the entire ship was ready for battle. The guns were operated freely, and the transmission of ammunition and fire fighting were all in accordance with orders. There was silence, and the guests were moved and held their breath to watch. After the exercise, Commander Chen gave another encouraging speech, and the tea party ended. In the afternoon, a party branch was established. The following is a quick record of the speech. Since the establishment of the National Government, in the past two years, our Navy has successively built the Xianning and Yongxu warships. It can be imagined that the leaders of the country attach importance to naval construction and that Vice Minister Chen Shaokuan has put a lot of effort into planning. Now, the Minquan, which was subsequently built by the Jiangnan Shipyard, has also been completed. Today, the flag-raising ceremony is held, and Captain Luo is taking office on the same day. Xunyong is very happy to be ordered by the Navy Department to come to the ship to supervise the oath. I hope that the construction of our country's warships will become more prosperous day by day in order to strengthen our national defense. I especially hope that all colleagues will work together with one heart and one mind for the preservation of the new</p>

<h3 id="e178">Director Wu Discusses Dredging Yu Tang <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The Yu Tang River in the western countryside of Shanghai County has recently become increasingly silted. The County Construction Bureau's Second, Third, and Sixth Districts, along with local gentry, have initiated preparations for dredging. Wu Wenhua, Director of the Construction Bureau, is scheduled to meet with representatives from the districts and local figures today to conduct a renewed survey as a basis for action. Yesterday, Director Wu spoke in detail about the history of Yu Tang and the dredging plan, which is closely related to water conservancy. A record of this follows:</p>
<p>Yu Tang is the main east-west river in the county, receiving water from the Xiepu River in the east and reaching the Songjiang boundary in the west to connect with Lake Mao. It stretches over 4,700 zhang, equivalent to more than 27 li. The tributary rivers it receives include Yu'erjing, Zhangshugang, Lijia Gang, Daijia Gang, Dian Gang, Sha Gang, Zi Gang, Zhu Gang, Miao Jing, Heng Jing, Xin Gou, Xing Dou He, and Tangcun Jing. These rivers irrigate a total of over 54,000 mu of farmland. The eastern region is suitable for cotton, while the western countryside is suitable for rice. All water resources are drawn from here. Because the Huangpu River receives sea tides in the east, with muddy water entering and clear water leaving, silt accumulates easily. Therefore, the county records indicate that there was originally a rule of dredging every five years after periods of flooding or drought. However, since the dredging in the nineteenth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, over 30 years have passed, and the siltation has become increasingly severe. Boats and ships can barely pass. Repeated military disasters, a lack of attention, and the impoverished state of the people have made it difficult to start construction. The matter has been delayed until now. Now, unexpectedly, it is becoming dry land. The bureau, which is responsible for construction, cannot shirk its responsibility. We have sought opinions from relevant districts and local figures and have planned to dredge. On September 10th of the 18th year, the preparatory meeting for dredging Yu Tang was opened. After repeated discussions and consultations, we unanimously elected a standing committee to be responsible for carrying out the project. The current plan of action is: First, the bureau will resurvey the siltation of the riverbed and the current state of the tributary flows and bridges to estimate the overall dredging project. Second, the bureau will assign technicians to conduct detailed surveys to determine the details of the project and establish a budget. Third, we will submit a report to the provincial government requesting approval to implement the construction steps. The steps have been decided, but the difficult problem that needs to be resolved first is how to raise the funds. Regarding the collection of dredging funds, there are methods such as apportioning the cost based on the irrigated land along the river, borrowing from the provincial treasury first and then repaying it by levying a surcharge on the land over the years, or having landowners along the river contribute money and tenants contribute labor. For example, the Wujin section of the recently dredged Tuyang Canal is funded by levying three-tenths of the busy grain transport surcharge for a period of five years. The dredging of the Zhangfu Canal in Huai'an is funded by local contributions of four-tenths, and the provincial government allocates two-tenths from disaster relief funds and designates four-tenths. These all involve referring to the first and second methods and adjusting them to the circumstances. However, the former case relates to the Grand Canal, and the latter relates to the Huai transport system. Neither is a simple matter for a single county or region, which is very different from the situation of Yu Tang. Furthermore, according to the old example of dredging Yu Tang, the general principle is to mostly adopt the third method, handling the dredging independently. Therefore, the current method of raising funds still follows the previous example in principle. However, before construction, there are fees for surveying, and before excavation, there are fees for embankment construction and bridge repair, all of which require initial expenditures. Sporadic collections may not be sufficient for the people, and apportionment by household may cause delays. It may still be necessary to use the first and second methods to borrow in advance to facilitate implementation. All of this will be determined after the actual survey is carried out and the budget is established. In short, in this time of public and private difficulty, the bureau can only do its best to strive forward.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Two Important Telegrams from the National Federation of Commerce <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Urging a Delay in Lace Inspection—To the Honorable Executive Yuan, Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Finance of the National Government in Nanjing: We have received a telegram from the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Lace Embroidery Trade Association, stating, "Our companies and firms have received a public letter from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on March 12th, stating that lace is a handicraft product of our country and also a part of foreign trade, with about 500,000 women across the country depending on it for a living. In addition to the original telegram on file, which is not redundantly described, we request the Federation of Commerce and all chambers of commerce to unanimously support and present our difficulties, requesting the abolition [of the inspection]." Attached are detailed rules signed and noted to the meeting. In response, we believe that the first essential for commodity inspection is standards. Lace embroidery has thousands of variations in patterns and designs, with different products and different times. To establish a standard for inspection would be difficult and obstructive. The reason is the same as why it is impossible to establish an exchange for silk fabrics, as there are too many patterns that change frequently. As for the excessive fees and the dispatch of personnel for guidance, those are secondary issues. This industry belongs to handicraft products and is a major part of our country's recent foreign trade of domestic goods. In recent years, merchants' capital has been insufficient, and they have suffered from foreign economic encroachment. Domestic merchants are merely entrusted to use their money. In the past, the Ministry of Finance, considering domestic goods, specially exempted various types of transit taxes, as documented in two orders. To maintain and develop this industry, we should find ways to help increase its capital to facilitate business and prevent profits from going to foreigners. If inspection is carried out without standards, it would not be in line with the policy of encouraging handicraft products for foreign trade and protecting women's handicrafts. The association feels this is a crisis and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we are sending this telegram to your esteemed Yuan and Ministries for review, requesting that the inspection of lace be temporarily delayed until the trade association is formally established. At that time, they should be ordered to establish regulations and improve product quality to facilitate foreign trade. In this way, promotion and support would still have the intention of advancement, and both commercial and industrial sectors would benefit greatly. We are deeply grateful." Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce; Su Minsheng, Zhang Yuquan, Lu Guangji, Chen Riping, Li Kuian, Peng Chuli, and others, kowtow.</p>
<p>Requesting the Maintenance of Swatow Telephone—To the Honorable Executive Yuan, Ministry of Transportation, and Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government in Nanjing; and to the Honorable Guangdong Provincial Government Construction Department in Guangzhou: We have received a report from Chen Zhiying, executive committee member of the affiliated association, representing the Swatow General Chamber of Commerce, stating that the Swatow-Chaozhou-揭陽-普寧 long-distance telephone company, run by merchants, was established in the ninth year of the Republic and approved by the provincial government. In the seventeenth year of the Republic, the Construction Department approved the registration and issued a license. In February of this year, part of the shareholders' stock was transferred to Ren Shou Tang and Jin Cheng Tang, who were original shareholders. On March 9th, a letter was received from the Swatow Electric Bureau, stating that, according to the Ministry of Transportation's order, the merchant-run telephone company must submit an application for registration to the Ministry within one month. While complying with this order, on the 20th, a letter was suddenly received from the Swatow Electric Bureau, stating that, according to two telegrams from Yuan Hao of the Ministry of Transportation, the company was illegally established and that the private transfer of business to Ren Shou Tang was even more inappropriate. It should be taken over by the Ministry, and the original capital of 12,000 yuan would be repaid from the surplus, etc. The Electric Bureau then forcibly took over the company. The company petitioned the Swatow General Chamber of Commerce for support, and the Swatow General Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Transportation requesting the withdrawal of the Ministry's takeover order. A letter was then sent to the factory committee, reporting to the association requesting assistance. In addition, Lu Shaofan, the company's representative, reported to the association, stating the same as above. The company was founded ten years ago, and the provincial government and departments approved the registration, so it was not illegally established. The capital was not just 12,000 yuan. As for the transfer of stock, it is a common practice for merchant-run companies. Ren Shou Tang, namely Chen Pengqiu, the former vice president of the Swatow General Chamber of Commerce, is indeed a legitimate businessman. At a time when the regulations protecting privately-run electrical enterprises have been promulgated, if a privately-run telephone company is suddenly nationalized, it would be contrary to the original intention of maintaining privately-run companies. Moreover, according to the report from Representative Lu, the case occurred because Chen Xinyu, a partner who had quit the company, falsely accused the Swatow Electric Bureau, which then telegraphed the Ministry. Therefore, the other three merchant-run telephone companies in Swatow have no problems. Considering this, it seems that there is suspicion of favoritism. An investigation should be sent to clarify the truth. In order to respect the law and maintain commerce, the association is jointly telegraphing your esteemed Yuan and Ministries for review, requesting a prompt withdrawal of the Ministry's takeover order and a return of the company to merchant management for reorganization and compliance with the deadline for submission to the Ministry for registration. We also request the provincial government and departments to instruct the Swatow Municipal Government to protect the company. We hope for a telegram in response. With deep gratitude, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, et al.</p>
<h3 id="e182">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Maintains Yangtze River Traffic <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Upstream Steamers Have Stopped—The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company originally had ten ships operating on the Yangtze River. As of yesterday, the Shanghai branch of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has canceled the upstream routes from Shanghai to Hankow, and there are temporarily no ships operating today. Furthermore, the Sanbei Company's Chang'an and Dexing ships cannot sail downstream, so there are no ships available to Hankow, resulting in a suspension of service. There will be no Chinese ships sailing on the Yangtze River from Shanghai this week.</p>
<p>Fourteen Ships to Suspend Service First—The Shanghai Navigation Industry Association, in order to maintain traffic and commerce on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, has invited representatives from various shipping companies to a meeting to discuss ways to balance commerce and transportation. It is reported that yesterday's discussions resulted in the designation of six ships from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which had temporarily suspended services, and the agreement to suspend service for eight ships from Sanbei, Zhaoxing, and other companies, for a total of fourteen ships. If further suspensions are necessary, they will be discussed again today and shared among the companies.</p>
<p>Three Major Yangtze River Ships Can Return—The Jianghua, Jiangshun, Jiangxin, and other ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company that are currently in operation are the top-tier ships among the Chinese-owned Yangtze River steamers, referred to by the company as the "Three Major Yangtze River Ships." Their operations have ceased this time upon arrival in Hankow. Because this concerns the lifeline of the business, Li Yunliang, the business section chief who is in Hankow for inspection, has repeatedly negotiated. Yesterday at noon, a telegram was received from Li, stating that the Three Major Yangtze River Ships can all depart from Hankow and sail eastward to Shanghai in approximately four or five days. Starting next week, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company may be able to operate one or two ships on the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>The Water Conservancy Commission Dredges Sandbars—The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission of the Ministry of Transportation has specially dispatched Acting Engineer Li Qianruo to Shanghai to inquire with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company about the shallow shoals and sandbars in the Yangtze River in preparation for dredging. The company has submitted its opinions, stating that the Shanghai-Hankow waterway is constantly changing, with the riverbanks on both sides also collapsing and silting up. The problem with the river flow is that it has not been guided to follow the natural course, resulting in the blockage of many important waterways. During periods of low water, navigation is extremely dangerous. For example, in the Yadan Zhou waterway upstream of Huangshigang, the hidden sandbar and narrow waterway in Lanxi on the upper reaches, the customs house specifically prohibits night navigation during low water and sets up red flag, black ball, and light vessels to warn of the dangers. In recent years, merchants have suffered greatly. Taking advantage of this low water period, dredging should be carried out as soon as possible. The Water Conservancy Commission will base its actions on this proposal and conduct a preliminary survey.</p>
<p>More Ships Are Stopping Upstream—Since the labor strikes by boatmen in Chongqing and stevedores in Yichang, an increasing number of foreign-owned ships are suspending service to Shanghai. There are currently four British ships and three Japanese ships that cannot sail upstream and are therefore staying in Shanghai, anchored idly in the Huangpu River.</p>

<p>Well, well, well, Bullets flying everywhere</p>
<p>Twisting stairs evade danger</p>
<p>The bandit den is luxuriously decorated</p>
<p>The hotel has a secret setup</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper gave a detailed account of Yan Ruling's escape from kidnapping. Further reports have been received describing the circumstances of the arrest, and they are recorded here. Jin Jiulin, Special Agent Detective Inspector of the French Concession Police, after investigating and confirming that the bandit den was located on the third floor of the Western-style house at 356 Jin Shenfu Road, reported to West Inspector Sachair. Together with West Detective Inspector Belgie, West Detective Gélanti, Chinese Detectives Li Yaolong, Mao Jingen, Qian Yumin, and Bao Detectives Zhou Yaoting, Zhang Ziying, Zhou Buguang, Qin Youyu, and more than ten others, they fully armed themselves and drove to the location in cars on the evening before last to make the arrest. Upon reaching their destination, the detectives scattered to ambush and surround the bandit den. Chinese and Western detectives knocked on the back door, and a bandit answered. The detectives immediately captured him. The bandit shouted loudly, "Well, well, well." Upon hearing this, the bandit guarding the hostage on the third floor knew that the detectives had come to make arrests. He took out a pistol and a Mauser pistol at the staircase and opened fire downwards to resist arrest. The detectives also opened fire in response. Nearly eighty shots were fired. Fortunately, the staircase in the Western-style house was circular and winding, allowing the detectives to dodge and rush upstairs fearlessly. They captured two bandits in the pavilion room on the second floor. Seeing that the situation was not good, the kidnappers on the third floor opened the windows and fled to the roof. The detectives also chased onto the roof and captured four or five people. At the same time, they rescued the hostage. In total, more than ten kidnappers were captured, including Zhang Fengxiang, Zhou Bingcheng, Tao Jinbao, Wang, A Da, Fang Youshan, Luo Shisheng, and others. They were handcuffed together in a chain. Then, three pistols, one Mauser pistol, and nearly twenty bullets were found in the bandit den. After the search was completed, the hostage and the bandits were taken to the police station in separate cars. First, the hostage was escorted home. Then, the detectives interrogated the bandits and learned that secret setups were located in the Dongya and Central Hotels. Detective Jin led the detectives to the British Concession Police Station and, together with Chinese and Western detectives, went to the two hotels. The bandits had already fled upon hearing the news. The detectives reported back to the West Inspector, who ordered a strict search for the bandit gang to bring them to justice. It is reported that the bandit den was luxuriously decorated, with the rooms full of mahogany furniture and equipped with telephones.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Coincidentally, Another Madwoman is Discovered <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Topless, Wielding a Knife and Axe</p>
<p>Again Staging a Violent Scene of Chopping People with a Knife</p>
<p>A Second Landlady Chopped Five Times</p>
<p>The Injuries are Severe and Life-Threatening</p>
<p>Wang Quanfu, a local from the Fan Family Residence at 19 Hongzhen, earns a living as a laborer. He rents out his spare rooms to Wang Da, a Tongzhou rickshaw puller, and his wife, Cao, who is 47 years old. Last year, she suffered from a mental illness, but was later cured. Her husband Da did not know that it had recently relapsed. At around 9:00 AM yesterday, Wang Da went out to pull a rickshaw, and Cao's old illness relapsed. She was topless, holding a knife in her left hand and an axe in her right. She barged into the room of Wang Shen, the wife of the second landlord Wang Quanfu. At the time, Shen was just getting out of bed. Seeing Cao wielding a knife and an axe and stumbling in, she was greatly alarmed. Cao did not say a word and went straight to the bedside, drew the blade, raised the axe, and chopped at Shen. Shen was, after all, a woman, and could only shout for help. Her head and face were chopped in more than five places, and she fainted to the ground while bleeding profusely. The madwoman Cao then began to wave her hand. At that time, a patrol police officer from the Hongzhen Police Station of the Fifth District, Third Precinct Public Security Bureau happened to be passing by Dexingli and heard cries for help. Following the sound, he saw the truth and arrested the madwoman. When asked why she killed someone, she spoke incoherently, only saying, "I couldn't stand it, it's nothing." The victim, Wang Shen, is 34 years old. After the incident, she was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Because the injuries are severe, her life is in danger. This incident and the murder case by a madman that occurred in the Nanshi district a few days ago are truly coincidental.</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Madman's Life Can Be Saved <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>But His Foot Must Be Sawed Off</p>
<p>The events of the madman, Zhang Jiazhen, killing one woman and one child and injuring another child in front of the Qunxue Society on Zhonghua Road have been recorded in previous newspapers. After the Yang Prosecutor of the local court accepted the case, he ordered the bailiffs to go to Xinpuyu Hall to examine the madman and ask him the reason. Unexpectedly, he still answered with the words "Heaven ordered me to kill them." After the bailiffs reported back, Prosecutor Yang, together with Secretary Mao and Inspector Shen, went to the court yesterday morning to conduct an inspection. The madman's injuries can be guaranteed not to threaten his life, but his foot must be sawed off; otherwise, it will spread to other parts, and the danger is unimaginable. When asked why he killed, he still gave no coherent answer. The official then instructed the hall to report if the madman could be cured so that the case could be investigated.</p>

<p>At around 9:00 PM on the night before last (the 31st), more than ten robbers suddenly came to the home of Ni Ruicheng, a villager behind Ni Jia Temple, about six li north of Xinchang Town in Pudong. Showing pistols and Mauser pistols, they threatened and intimidated, and arbitrarily searched for valuables. However, the family of peasants had no valuable possessions, only a few cloth clothes. They kidnapped his son, Yongsheng, and took him away. At this time, Ni's wife, Ma, was deeply attached to her son and could not bear to part with him. Disregarding the danger, she stepped forward to stop them. The robbers turned around and fired several shots, one bullet hitting her left leg. Bleeding profusely, she fainted to the ground. The robbers then left. The injured woman hired a boat to Shanghai at dawn and was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau began handling the fourth registration of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, it has organized the Fourth Traditional Chinese Medicine Examination Committee to review and examine the registered practitioners. However, there are still a few practitioners who have not received notification letters due to being away on business or having unclear addresses, preventing them from taking the examination as scheduled.

<p>The Section of North Sichuan Road Has Been Installed</p>
<p>The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company is adding an 8-inch diameter pipe to Shiqing Road to connect the existing two small-diameter pipes, which are insufficient to meet the increased water demand from the newly built houses on both sides of the road. The new pipe will connect to the pipes on Yokohama Road in the south and Xingjiazhai Road in the north to form a circulating water flow and to provide relief in case of a failure in the Dongbaoxing main pipe. However, the section crossing North Sichuan Road is a road built by the Public Concession outside its boundaries. The company submitted a request to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities to negotiate with the Public Concession Council for the issuance of a road excavation permit. The Bureau then sent a letter through the Municipal Government Secretariat and obtained the agreement of the Council. The company has now completed the installation in the section of North Sichuan Road and will continue to bury the pipes on Shiqing Road.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the number of fatal vehicle accidents on the roads of the Public Concession in the first three months of this year has decreased compared to the same period last year as a result of public cooperation with the police. As of yesterday, only twenty-seven people have died in vehicle accidents this year, compared to thirty-three in the same period last year. Of these twenty-seven deaths, ten occurred in March, eight of whom were due to their own carelessness, and two of whom were due to the drivers' fault. The police have charged those responsible with manslaughter in the Provisional Court. In addition, 320 people have been injured this year. Bicycles are the most difficult vehicles for traffic police to manage. There have been a total of 105 bicycle accidents in the past three months, injuring twelve people. There have been 725 car accidents, killing eight people and injuring 254 people. There have been 487 accidents involving various types of hand-pulled vehicles. Among the bicycle accidents, 43 were due to the fault of the riders. This is because these vehicles are often ridden by minors who often disregard all safety regulations, leading to frequent accidents. Therefore, some have proposed increasing the registration fee to regulate them. The roads most prone to accidents are still Nanjing Road, Xizang Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and North Sichuan Road.</p>

Director Yuan paid close attention to the diligence of the officers on duty along the way. After inspecting the police station, they took the original boat north at the ferry and docked near the Lan Nidu Wharf. Detectives Zhang Yong and Yang Jinsheng from the Third District greeted them ashore and escorted them directly to the Third District Headquarters. By this time, it was noon, and they had lunch in the district. District Chief Zhang Wuqin then summoned all the patrol officers and chiefs from the district and the various foreign factories to the district headquarters. Director Yuan inspected them and then gave a speech. He said that the police are public servants and should act with integrity. The only goal of the police is to eliminate violence, maintain order, and prevent harm. Therefore, they should do their best to maintain peace and stability. Local officials should especially lead by example and avoid any improper acts such as corruption or embezzlement. The director of the bureau uses personnel impartially. All officials are personally examined and hired. Recommendations from private individuals are not accepted. Rewards and punishments are clearly defined. For example, seven patrol chiefs have recently been promoted to patrol officers for their good service to encourage them. Therefore, the police should strive to improve themselves step by step. The director also has an ideal to train the city's police force to become a model for the entire country to achieve the goal of recovering the concessions in the future. It is hoped that everyone will work diligently and faithfully, and that the officials unite to benefit the region. The director has high hopes for this. After the speech, they inspected the district's dispatch room, household registration office, detention center, and the district chief's office, expressing satisfaction. It was not until 4:00 PM that they walked to the Fourth Police Squadron in Lujiazui for detailed inspection and then took the original boat back to the bureau. It is reported that tomorrow they will continue to go to Pudong to inspect the Second Sub-office of the Third District in Yangjingzhen and the Fourth Sub-office of the Third District in Gaoqiao.</p>

<p>Su Xiaodi, a 44-year-old resident of the Su family pond house in Tangqiao, about eight miles north of Dachang Town in Baoshan, was in financial straits, so he entrusted a middleman to sell his six mu of farmland. At 10:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, he received a deposit of 50 yuan. Unexpectedly, at about 10:30 p.m. the previous night, more than twenty bandits, wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers, speaking with a local accent, and with their faces painted in various colors, went to Su's house, kicked open the door, and rushed in. They pulled out handguns and threatened Su Xiaodi to hand over the full price of the land. Su dared not resist and immediately took out the 50 yuan deposit and handed it to one of the leading bandits. The bandits suspected that Su was intentionally withholding the full amount, so they beat Su all over with iron bars and ordered him to reveal where the money was hidden. In great pain, Su randomly claimed that the land price was hidden in a stone cave at the foot of the Tangqiao Bridge. The bandits believed him and forced Su to lead them to the bridge abutment. Su tried to jump into the river to commit suicide, but was pulled back by the bandits and taken back to Su's house. They took the large iron pot used for cooking rice from the stove, then overturned Su naked onto the stove and burned firewood under the stove. Su's chest and abdomen were burned by the fire, and he cried out for help. The bandits clapped and laughed wildly, then fled eastward, firing several shots before leaving. Although nearby farmers heard the noise, they dared not help. After the bandits left, people went to Su's house to check, but Su Xiaodi had been burned so severely that his condition was critical. In addition, Xu, the 32-year-old wife of Cao Fusheng, a resident of Caobing Lane, about four miles southeast of Dachang, ran a burlap bag shop in Zhabei in this city. She returned home to sweep the tombs the day before yesterday morning. At about 11:30 p.m. the previous night, she was also robbed by similar face-painted bandits. The bandits robbed Cao Xu of a pair of gold bracelets, two rings, clothes, and more than 20 silver yuan. After succeeding, they also stripped her naked, placed her on the stove, burned firewood, and fled with shouts. After people went to rescue her, her breasts and lower body were burned. The scene was too horrible to look at. Afterwards, both the Su and Cao families reported to the Dachang Township branch of the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau and the Dachang Security Corps. However, the police force was weak, and the head of the Security Corps, Lu Fengpu, was accused by the members of failing to take responsibility, allowing the bandits to escape. Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau had already sent detectives to arrest them everywhere.</p>

<p>Due to the reorganization of fire prevention in Zhabei, the Shanghai Special Municipal Public Security Bureau recently convened a meeting of the directors of the Zhabei fire brigades and staff of the water company. The result was that due to the vastness of Zhabei and the lack of fire hydrants, firefighting was very difficult in case of fire. It was urgent to add them where necessary. It was decided to set a date for a joint survey. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00, Yu Suqiao, a staff member of the Second Section, and Section Chief Song of the Public Utilities Bureau, went to the Zhabei Third Section Fire Brigade, together with Director Yao Xiangsheng of the First Section, staff of the Second and Third Sections, and the Business Director of the Zhabei Water Company, to inspect the roads in Zhabei for a week. It was decided to add twenty-five fire hydrants. The water company will immediately select workers to install them in the order of the locations determined by the fire brigade, to strengthen fire prevention. By the time the survey was completed and they returned to the bureau, it was already past 6:00.</p>

<p>Chen Baoshan, a 20-year-old from Shangyu, boarded the Anshan Maru ferry of the Osaka Company at dusk on the 27th of last month. Just as it reached mid-stream, Chen left a note and threw himself into the river. The note stated that he had been deceived in love with a prostitute, losing both his money and his heart, and therefore committed suicide. The ferry captain reported the incident to the Water Police Station for record. Details were reported in the previous newspaper. It is now learned that two men, Chen Ruijun and Chen Jinbiao, claiming to be cousins of the deceased, went to the police station yesterday, claiming that the deceased's original name was Jiayou, with the courtesy name Xuewen, later changed to Baoshan. His parents were deceased, and he had no wife or family, being all alone. He resided in a boarding house at 134 Xinzha Road in this city, working as a shop assistant, and presented a red name card of Chen Baoshan issued by the Shangyu County government, requesting the police station to recover the deceased's body so that they could arrange the funeral. The police chief instructed them to wait for notification after the body was recovered. Also, the Shangyu Native Association in Shanghai, considering that the deceased was from Shangyu and a fellow townsman, felt it was their duty to assist. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Water Police Station requesting an investigation. The letter stated: "To the Director, Having read in the newspaper that Chen Baoshan of Shangyu was deceived of all his wealth and forced to write a promissory note by the prostitute Zheng Meihong of No. 203 Yulin Lane, Guling Road, colluding with the pimp Hu Bingsheng, and was driven to suicide by drowning, our association, based on the principles of our fellow townsmen, cannot shirk our duty. We will immediately select personnel to investigate the facts to seek redress. This matter concerns human life, and we request the police station to thoroughly investigate and handle it according to the law, to uphold humanity." After receiving the letter, the police station replied to the association, requesting them to send personnel to present their case in person.</p>

Yesterday, the section chief ordered patrolman Chen Zhanyin to lead a squad of police officers to serve at the substation. After receiving the order, patrolman Chen immediately led the officers to the station, and they began to take turns on duty from yesterday.</p>

<p>An Old Woman Injured, Two People Dead</p>
<p>An Old Woman Staggering Along: The Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe long-distance bus, the 1:00 p.m. bus driven by the newly hired Pan Liansheng, who had only been working for three days, caused an accident on the Shenkai-Minhang route. As the bus was approaching the south end of Zhuanqiao Station on the main road, an old woman, about fifty years old, suddenly staggered across the road. Pan Liansheng repeatedly honked the horn, but she ignored it and continued to walk, so the bus was unable to give way and knocked her down. The front of the bus grazed the left corner of the old woman's forehead, causing her to bleed profusely and lose consciousness. She was later revived after being rescued. The impact also slightly damaged the engine of the bus, rendering it unable to run. The company was notified and sent personnel to repair it. The passengers were carried by another bus. At the same time, the injured old woman was sent to Minhang Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>A Hawker Careless: Zhang Apei, a 60-year-old local hawker living in Xiaonanmen, was struck by a private car No. 6226 driven by Jiang Zidong, residing at No. 99 Xiafei Lane, Xiafei Road in the French Concession, as he was walking through the area on the afternoon of the 12th of last month. Zhang was knocked down and injured his head, and died on the ground on Pushi Road the next day. The police reported to the police station, and the body was taken to the autopsy center. Judge Zhu of the French Court came to the center to verify the cause of death. Finding no relatives of the deceased, the court arranged for burial. Yesterday, the police summoned Jiang to the French Court for questioning. The head of the Vehicle Department first testified, explaining the previous situation. Questioned, Jiang Zidong testified that the deceased was walking from north to south and bumped into the rear wheel of the merchant's car. When the merchant realized it, he immediately stopped the car, but the deceased had already fallen to the ground. The police arrived and helped him into the car. At that time, the deceased was conscious. He took him to the hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, the injury was not serious. After applying medicine, he was discharged from the hospital. He accompanied him to the police station. After questioning, the police chief determined that the deceased was not careful and ordered the merchant to give him two yuan to go home and rest. Later, he did not know how, the deceased fell to the ground and died at Pushi Road. He found that the merchant's car was driving very slowly at the time, and it was indeed the deceased's own carelessness that caused the accident. He asked for investigation. Then, patrolman No. 446 testified that he was on the scene that day and saw that the defendant's car was driving very slowly. The Chinese and Western officials ruled that it was indeed the deceased's carelessness, and the case should be closed.</p>
<p>Unable to Avoid in Time: Zhang Jinsheng, a 26-year-old local carpenter, was riding a rickshaw through the intersection of Laobazi Road and North Sichuan Road at 8:30 a.m. yesterday when he was suddenly run over by a private car No. 909 owned by Shen (who ordered the chauffeur to send his two sons to school). Unable to avoid it in time, Zhang was crushed to the ground, his skull fractured, and blood gushed out. The rickshaw was completely damaged. Two plainclothes officers were patrolling the area and arrested the chauffeur and sent him to the police station. The injured person was rushed to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that his injuries were critical.</p>
<h3 id="e203">A Woman Requests Dissolution of Marriage <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Chen, a resident of No. 318 Yuqing Lane, Zhaofeng Road, and engaged in the automobile business in Pudong, whose given name is Guiying and is 19 years old, was betrothed to Qu Miaofu of No. 4 Zhongshi Lane, Yangjiadu, Pudong, when she was ten years old, with Chen Achun as the matchmaker. They were scheduled to marry this spring. However, Chen Guiying claimed that the marriage was not agreed to by her and hired lawyer Ye Kang to file a petition with the District Court requesting dissolution of the marriage, stating that the defendant's side had contacted her father and hastily arranged the marriage. The defendant, Qu Miaofu, has no permanent employment, is idle all day, and is habitually dissolute. As this concerns her lifelong happiness, she requested permission to dissolve the marriage. Yesterday, Judge Yang Keqian held a hearing in court. The defendant did not appear. According to the plaintiff Chen Guiying's testimony, she is 19 years old and a local. (Question) When were you engaged? (Answer) In the tenth year of the Republic [1921], when I was only ten years old. It was entirely decided by my parents. My mother is now deceased. (Question) How much betrothal gift was there at the time? (Answer) Gold bracelets, gold rings, and gold ruyi hairpins, etc. (Question) Who was the matchmaker? (Answer) The matchmaker was Chen Achun, who is now deceased. (Question) Why do you want to request the dissolution of the marriage? (Answer) He has no job. (Question) Did you know this when you were engaged? (Answer) I knew it, but I was very young at the time. (Question) Why didn't you come to the last hearing? (Answer) Because the defendant's side asked someone to negotiate and settle it out of court, and asked me to request to withdraw the case, so I didn't go last time. Unexpectedly, they went back on their word and ignored it. (Question) Can it still be reconciled out of court? (Answer) There is no possibility of reconciliation. The judge then invited prosecutor Liu Pingfan to the court to express his opinion. The plaintiff's lawyer then rose and stated that the National Government adopted a lenient policy toward the dissolution of marriage. If one party disagrees, the marriage can be dissolved. Therefore, the dissolution of marriage is different from divorce, so the court must carefully consider and judge divorce cases. The plaintiff in this case was only ten years old when she was engaged and had no judgment. Now she hears that the defendant's side is planning to marry her soon, so the plaintiff suddenly panicked. Although the plaintiff's age has not reached the age of autonomy in marriage, considering that the defendant has no profession and the future is bleak, for the sake of her lifelong happiness, she has no choice but to request permission to dissolve the marriage. The judge then announced the end of the debate and adjourned the hearing to await the verdict.</p>

<p>At the home of Gu Xuegen in Gujiabang, Changping Road, Hongqiao, at around 9:00 p.m. the night before last, four robbers suddenly arrived, robbing with guns, obtaining more than two hundred silver dollars. Just as they were about to escape, four Chinese police officers, Nos. 463 and 2138, and one Indian police officer, who heard the news, entered the house to arrest the robbers. The robbers opened fire first, and the police returned fire. As a result, Chinese police officer Liu Youqing, No. 463, was shot and injured, and No. 2138 was also shot and fell to the ground. The robbers all escaped in the hail of bullets. Later, the Gordon Road Police Station learned of the incident and sent detective Bao Lisheng to investigate with a Western detective. They sent the two injured police officers to the police hospital. Police officer No. 2138 was slightly injured and unharmed, but Liu Youqing died immediately. The detectives took the body to the Feilun Road morgue. At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the District Court appointed prosecutor Guo Wei to the morgue for a preliminary examination of the body.

The Shanghai Municipal Council should provide appropriate compensation in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<p>The Yangzhou Guild Hall in this city annually handles about one thousand coffins for the seven counties under Yangzhou jurisdiction. They are usually numbered by the Guild Hall and handed over to boatman Gu Dechen for transport to Jiangbei for collection by the families. However, twenty-seven coffins transported last winter were frozen on the way to Wutaishan, Yangzhou, and had to be temporarily stored in the Yangzhou cemetery. When they went to retrieve them this spring, four coffins were missing. It has now been discovered that boatman Zhu Dashizi is suspected of making false reports to compete for the contract to transport coffins. The 23rd detachment of the Zhabei Songhu Security Corps has sent personnel to intercept Zhu Dashizi's boat, but the person has escaped and is currently being investigated.</p>

<p>The elderly Mrs. Hou Zhang, a 67-year-old local residing in the Wu family house behind the John Garden in Caoyang Road, Hongqiao, Western Shanghai, accidentally burned paper ingots for ancestor worship at about 10:20 a.m. yesterday, causing a fire in thatched cottage No. 35. Thick smoke filled the air, and flames roared, quickly spreading to thatched cottages Nos. 36, 37, and 38. Fortunately, due to the strong wind and dryness, the fire was very fierce, but nearby residents rose up and demolished a thatched house to isolate the fire, which was extinguished after more than twenty minutes. The four thatched houses were almost completely destroyed. The police from the Sixth District Police Station were dispatched to bring the fire starter, Mrs. Hou Zhang, and five victims, including Liu Asan, back to the district. After questioning by District Chief Duan, the victims stated that Liu Asan, 39 years old, from Haimen, lived in No. 35; Yang Shengfa, 26 years old, from Haimen, lived in No. 36; Shi Cailang, 29 years old, from Chongming, lived in No. 37; Mrs. Liu, 41 years old, from Tongzhou, lived in No. 38; and Zhu Quan, 40 years old, from Jiading, lived in No. 39.

<h3 id="e208">New System for Manchuria Railway Freight <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Implementation of the Metric System</p>
<p>Every year, a large amount of goods are transported from Shanghai to the northeastern provinces, such as Fengtian, Changchun, Andong, Niuzhuang, and Gongzhuling. The South Manchuria Railway accounts for most of the goods transported. The Dalian Steamship Company, affiliated with the railway, is the joint transportation agency for passengers and freight. Due to the success of its business in recent years, it has plans for a major expansion this year. The company's freight transport has always used Japanese shaku and kan, as well as British and American pounds and yards. It is now announcing to the Dalian Steamship Company in this city that it is changing to the new metric system. It is said that 64 countries in the world use this new system, so the company is also changing its regulations. Currently, in China, only the Jichang Railway uses the metric system for freight. For example, if a carload of goods is calculated at 33 American tons, which is 49,816 catties, it becomes 30 tons if the metric system is used. In fact, 104 catties can be loaded more. In the new system, "length" includes (1) micron, abbreviated as (mu), which is one millionth of a meter; (2) millimeter, abbreviated as (hao), which is one thousandth of a meter; (3) centimeter, abbreviated as (li), which is one hundredth of a meter; (4) decimeter, abbreviated as (fen), which is one tenth of a meter. Also, one meter is equal to 3.3000 Japanese shaku, 3.2804 British feet, or 1.09361 yards. One "ton" is equal to 0.62137 miles, one "metric ton" is equal to 0.98420 British tons and 1.1023 American tons. The new freight rates for the metric system that have been set are specially recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Destination) (First Class Freight Rate) (Second Class Freight Rate) (Third Class Freight Rate) (Fourth Class Freight Rate)</p>
<p>Dan/Ton Yuan Dan/Ton Yuan Dan/Ton Yuan Dan/Ton Yuan</p>
<p>Fengtian 1.85 12.53 1.50 10.28 1.15 7.51 0.80 5.32</p>
<p>Tieling 2.15 14.81 1.73 12.14 1.32 8.85 0.92 6.29</p>
<p>Kaiyuan 2.28 16.12 1.83 13.10 1.40 9.60 0.97 6.37</p>
<p>Andong 3.20 N/A 2.59 17.60 1.96 12.88 1.35 9.00</p>
<p>Niuzhuang 1.59 N/A 1.29 8.34 0.99 6.32 0.70 4.35</p>
<p>Changchun 3.42 23.52 2.72 18.83 2.08 14.20 1.40 9.62</p>
<p>Gongzhuling 3.15 21.41 1.52 17.17 1.93 12.98 1.32 8.73</p>
<p>The above freight rates are calculated in Japanese yen. Shanghai must also pay in Chinese currency according to the market price. This metric system is new to Shanghai, so it is specially recorded in detail.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Relief for Bovine Plague Near Shanghai <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Commodity Inspection Bureau Succeeds in Manufacturing Bovine Plague Serum</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce believes that the prevalence of bovine plague in our country causes losses of no less than tens of millions of yuan every year. Even the milk farms in Shanghai and its vicinity suffer significant losses every year due to bovine plague and the death of cattle. The bureau's veterinarians Yi Wenzhi, Luo Qingsheng, and technician Shou Biao believe that this is a problem for China's animal husbandry industry and must be urgently addressed. In addition to their inspection work, they have been researching the manufacture of bovine plague serum. The bureau strongly supports their proposal and has rented five mu of land on Tiyu Road, Jiangwan, and purchased many cattle for experiments. It is now reported that the experiments have been successful, and the manufactured serum has been tested repeatedly and proven to be sufficient to resist bovine plague. It is said that five cattle were used in the first experiment and four cattle in the second experiment. The experimental methods were divided into two types: (1) Inject the manufactured serum into the healthy and disease-free cattle, and then inject blood poison (i.e., blood containing bovine plague bacteria) into the cattle at the same time. The cattle do not show any symptoms and are permanently immune to bovine plague. (2) Inject blood poison into the healthy and disease-free cattle, and the cattle develop disease. Then inject the manufactured serum into the cattle, and the cattle recover. The results were very satisfactory. The bureau now plans to further demonstrate the greatness of its effectiveness from multiple perspectives and in practice. It plans to send letters to the Shanghai Special Municipal Municipal Committee Offices and the Shanghai County Township Government, stating that the bureau can provide injections free of charge when bovine plague occurs in the townships to ensure that the experiments are more accurate. It is said that Wu Tingyang, the former director of the Guangxi Construction Department, and Niu Houze, the Gansu disaster relief representative, greatly admired this plan and the success of the experiment, and personally visited Jiangwan to observe the cattle. Niu Jun said that Gansu province has more than 4 million cattle, and many cattle die from bovine plague every year. He expressed enthusiastic sympathy for the manufacture of bovine plague serum and said that he would like to study manufacturing there in the future.</p>

<p>15th Committee Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday at 4 PM, the Jiangsu Provisional Relief Association held its 15th committee meeting in the back hall of Renji Hall. More than ten committee members attended, including Wang Yiting, Huang Boyu, Huang Hanzhi, Jiao Leshan, Gao Henian, Zhu Xiechen, and Cheng Yiqing. Wang Yiting chaired the meeting. The following matters were reported: (1) 260 yuan was remitted to Funing for relief efforts. (2) The association previously telegraphed the provincial government on the 銑 day, requesting 50,000 yuan for spring relief. A reply has been received stating that the provincial relief committee has been instructed to determine the amount, which will be submitted to the provincial government for decision. Another telegram was sent to the provincial relief committee yesterday urging them to expedite the review and submit it to the association for a decision as soon as possible. (3) Director Zhu informed that 28,500 yuan was released for relief in Xinghua and 4,370 yuan was used to subsidize porridge distribution. After deducting 20,000 yuan allocated by the association and 5,000 yuan turned over to the provincial government by the Xinghua Relief Branch, the remaining 7,870 yuan was raised locally, resulting in a balanced budget. (4) The Xinghua Relief Branch sent a letter of gratitude for the allocation of funds to help disaster victims, along with a plaque inscribed with "The People Will Not Forget" to express their appreciation. Director Zhu also forwarded a plaque inscribed with "Sweet Rain for the Populace" from Mr. Gao Henian and other representatives of the Xinghua Sixth District to the association to express their gratitude. (5) Relief funds received this week were discussed. (1) Spring relief is urgent. Although Huai'an has started, the relief funds are not yet secured. Liuhe has also been approved for additional relief funds. Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Jiangyin, and other counties are also proposed for discretionary subsidies. However, the association's relief funds have already been fully allocated. It is now necessary to raise funds urgently to avoid delaying the relief period. A resolution was proposed on how to raise funds. Resolution: Actively raise funds and simultaneously telegraph the provincial government to request additional allocation. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>The Ninghai County Relief Association recently telegraphed that representatives of disaster victims from the four rural districts are flocking to the association, weeping and claiming that they have exhausted grass roots and are now resorting to wheat seedlings. If relief is not provided promptly, they will face starvation. The association has dispatched personnel to inspect Huayu, Xiaopu, Jiantiao, Jiankang, Tangdou, Ao, Xiaoqingtang, Xincheng, Lejing, Gudu, Qianheng, Tiaotou, Maoyu, Liujing, Baijiao, Baiqi, Qian'ao, Qianfangtou, Liuhongying, and other places. Reports confirm the claims of the disaster victim representatives. They witnessed dozens of people, including Lin Xianchang of Xiaopu and Hu Biyan of Jiantiao, commit suicide due to unbearable hunger, with their corpses lying along the roadside, a truly tragic sight. If relief is further delayed, pushing them into desperation, unpredictable events may occur. They request that personnel be dispatched immediately with grain for spring relief to save the disaster victims and maintain public order. The association has previously allocated and remitted 10,000 yuan in relief funds to the Wenzhou and Taizhou prefectures in eastern Zhejiang. Due to the current spring famine, they are appealing to all sectors for assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Jisheng Association Pleads for Disaster Victims <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Letter to the National Government</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association writes that disasters have spread everywhere, and the people cannot bear their suffering. First, due to the lack of water conservancy, droughts and floods persist. Second, due to the presence of soldiers and bandits everywhere, the people are fleeing. Third, due to the failure of agriculture, production has decreased, leading to a shortage of rice in the south and wheat in the north, with reliance on imports from foreign countries. If the leak is not stopped, the foundation will be depleted. If we only focus on emergency relief, we must encourage increased agricultural production and remove obstacles to agriculture, industry, and commerce. Otherwise, empty talk of saving the country will lead to unimaginable consequences. With compassion, we appeal to the national government ministries and relief associations, pleading and beseeching them on behalf of the people. We have no choice but to raise our voices. The original manuscript is provided below. Wang Zhen, Chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Jisheng Association, and Vice-Chairmen Xu Mao and Huang Qinglan, wrote to the National Government Executive Yuan, Ministry of Interior, and Relief Commission: Our association is currently handling relief in dozens of counties in the seven provinces of Shaanxi, Suiyuan, Pingyuan, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu. The amount of relief funds spent is significant. However, based on reports of disasters from various provinces and counties, the area we are providing relief to is only one or two thousandths of the total area affected. It is a drop in the bucket, and universal relief is difficult. The dire circumstances reported are all based on the personal experiences and observations of our association's relief directors and staff, who have conducted on-site investigations. They are not based on hearsay or vague impressions. In the disaster areas, some people have died from cold and starvation due to the heavy snow and extreme cold last winter. Others have committed suicide due to years of drought and floods, facing famine. They are cooking bones, eating flesh, selling their wives and children, losing their homes and families, and separating from their loved ones. Corpses are everywhere, leading to the spread of epidemics. It is a human hell, an unprecedented disaster. The situation is especially dire in the Northwest. Nearly half of Shaanxi's population has died, and misfortune is spreading. In Suiyuan, fields are barren, and there is no ability to sow seeds, leading to a hopeless autumn harvest. There is no one to appeal to. Even in the relatively prosperous regions of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the disaster in more than ten counties north of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu and more than ten counties in Wenzhou and Taizhou in Zhejiang is severe. The hardship and displacement are beyond description and are unprecedented. The reasons for this are that first, due to the lack of water conservancy, any natural disaster, such as drought or flood, becomes unmanageable. Second, due to the presence of soldiers and bandits everywhere, those with some savings are relocating to better places. Third, due to the failure of agriculture, production has decreased, leading to soaring grain prices and public panic. Trade relies heavily on other countries, and economic control is in the hands of foreign merchants. Money flows out, and prices double. If this leak is not stopped, the foundation will be depleted. This is not just a matter of survival for people in disaster areas but will become unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore, with consecutive years of famine and poor harvests, not only will the famine victims in the Northwest fill the ditches, but the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will also face a similar fate. Our association considers disaster relief our duty and does not meddle in other affairs. We are deeply concerned about helping the needy and alleviating suffering. We have always done our best to provide disaster relief in provinces such as Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Shaanxi. We also carry out work relief to promote agriculture, prevent floods, and alleviate droughts. Now, during the period between the exhaustion of last year's harvest and the availability of the new crops, poor farmers have no means of livelihood, and there are many who cannot afford seeds. If we do not provide assistance now, planting will be delayed, and there will be no harvest in the autumn. If we face another famine year, the remaining people will face extinction. In the past, disasters only affected a few provinces or dozens of counties. Now, there is almost no province or area that is free from disaster. A great catastrophe has befallen us, which was unexpected. The situation requires urgent action. Our association is acting on our conscience to provide long-term planning for disaster victims. Our strength is insufficient, and we must appeal for help. Your esteemed office is the central authority for the whole country, and the welfare of the people is your concern. You should provide relief to the starving and open the granaries. How should we ensure that planting is not delayed, that production is increased, that the people can live in peace, and that farmers can work in peace? We hope you will review, consider, and implement measures to encourage and inspire them. Our association, on behalf of hundreds of millions of disaster victims, is deeply grateful and awaits your command.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Investigation of Stamp Tax Implementation Methods in Various Countries <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Manufactured National Goods Factory Association believes that stamp duties on documents provide legal protection and are recognized as legitimate taxes in various countries. However, the implementation methods vary. Therefore, the association requested its permanent lawyer, Mr. Wang Zhengshao, to consult and investigate the matter at various consulates. The following is a report based on Mr. Wang's findings: (1) United States: According to investigations at the US Commercial Counselor's Office and the US Consulate General in Shanghai, invoices for cash transactions are not subject to stamp duty. However, for other non-cash transaction documents with a term of more than twenty days, a stamp duty of one cent is levied per 100 yuan (refer to the 1924 US Stamp Tax Regulations). (2) United Kingdom: According to investigations at the British Consulate General, invoices for the sale of goods, other than payment receipts, are not subject to stamp duty. For various securities subject to stamp duty, the value must be at least two gold pounds (approximately equivalent to more than 20 yuan in national currency). (3) Japan: According to investigations at the Japanese Commercial Officer's Office and the Japanese Consulate General, the rules are the same as in the United Kingdom. The value of the securities subject to stamp duty must be at least 10 yuan. Amounts of 10 yuan or less are exempt from stamp duty.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Laundry Guild held a joint meeting of its executive, supervisory, and standing committees yesterday at 8 PM at 255 Weishui Lane, Ningbo Road, Public Concession. More than twenty people attended, including Zhu Rong and Zhang Liyong. The standing committee member Fang Yunlong was elected as the temporary chairman, and Fang Zhenlei served as the secretary. The meeting proceeded as planned. During the opening remarks, the chairman reported that the guild had been established for nine years. Due to the scattered nature of the industry, the guild's offices were established in two locations: (1) on Hanbili Road, Hongkou, as the Shanghai Laundry Guild, and (2) on Beidiluo Road, French Concession, as the Shanghai Laundry Guild Office. This was initially done for the convenience of industry members. However, current budget expenditures and monthly dues collected are insufficient to cover public expenses. Therefore, industry members have been called together to discuss merging the guild's offices into one location to reduce monthly expenses. A new address has already been selected, and preparations are being made to report to the authorities for record-keeping. Zhu Kunyang reported on the previous income and expenditure. Hu Shanlai proposed that the chairman appoint someone else to review and disclose the previous accounts to the public. Wu Rongfang reported that Fang Yunlong had been appointed as the standing committee member because the guild's internal restructuring had been unreliable. Therefore, he was appointed to reorganize everything. Huang Linqing proposed merging the labor union and establishing a joint labor-management committee to avoid labor disputes. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 AM.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Accountants Association reported that its members often encountered difficulties when applying to the local industrial and commercial administrative authorities for registration when providing services outside Shanghai, as stipulated in Article 6 of the Accountants Ordinance. Therefore, on February 13, the association requested the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to provide an interpretation for relief. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce replied in document Shang Zi No. 9164, stating that according to Article 6 of the Accountants Ordinance, accountants should directly submit their applications to the local industrial and commercial administrative authorities for approval when performing their duties. Regarding the matter of filing with the court, as stipulated in Article 10 of the same ordinance, the local administrative authority where the registration is sought should notify the court. If an accountants association has not been established in the place where the duties are performed, Article 16 of the same ordinance allows the accountant to join the nearest accountants association. Furthermore, with the exception of those who hold certificates issued by the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce and Ministry of Industry and Commerce of Beijing that have not been verified, all other certificates are naturally valid. The association is hereby notified accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Rare News from the Eastern Seas <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Qiushui</p>
<p>(1) Eighty Earthquakes in Twelve Hours: According to Japanese communications, there have been extremely numerous and intense earthquakes recently near Atami and the Izu Peninsula. In addition to those observed by residents, the seismographs at the observatory have detected over 700 earthquakes in the past three weeks. The most severe was on Monday the 11th of last week. On average, there have been at least eighty earthquakes per day between sunset and nightfall. Japan is known for its frequent earthquakes, but the number of occurrences this time is rare. However, authorities are somewhat fortunate, as frequent small earthquakes may prevent a severe earthquake. The Tokyo reconstruction project has just been completed, and it is hoped that a major earthquake like the one several years ago will not occur again amidst these seismic events. Residents are living in a state of panic. Most of the wealthy residents have moved elsewhere. It is also reported that the hot springs in Atami have suddenly lost their temperature after the earthquakes. Atami is known for its hot springs and is a popular tourist destination in the spring and summer. This is quite unusual. There are also rumors that a large tsunami will strike the area, which is increasing the residents' fear and leading to more migration. Although the authorities are trying to stop it, it is ineffective. If the earthquakes do not stop, the two areas mentioned above may become ruins.</p>
<p>(2) Reiteration of the Prohibition on Using Lead in Cosmetics: Japanese cosmetics are far inferior to those in Europe and America. Some women's cosmetics, such as powder and face powder, still contain lead. It has been reported that the Ministry of Interior has issued a clear order prohibiting the addition of lead to powder. Cosmetics containing lead are not only harmful to the user's skin, but recent surveys by health experts have revealed that most children who develop meningitis are due to their wet nurses or mothers using lead-based powder. Therefore, the Ministry of Interior has had to issue a strict ban to protect people's health. The prohibition of lead in cosmetics in Japan was previously issued in 1900. However, due to strong opposition from the business community, the decision was postponed. Now, thirty years later, the ban has been reiterated.</p>
<p>(3) Losses from the General Election: During the general election in Japan last month, the public sentiment was boiling, and businesses were shut down. We can see this in the newspapers. Their fervent attitude cannot but stir our patriotic hearts. It is said that the financial losses for both the government and the public during the recent Japanese general election were nearly 10 million yuan. Each candidate had to spend an average of over 50,000 yuan. Most of the money flowed into the pockets of printers. Election matters rely heavily on publicity, and publicity relies on printing, in addition to speeches. Therefore, many printing houses made a fortune from this election. Even in a corner of Tokyo, the money flowing into printing houses reached over 1 million yuan. They are lucky indeed.</p>

<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>The Kaleidoscope of the West Dormitory: After the ceremony, the new dormitory rooms were opened to the public. Students had taken the initiative to tidy up and decorate their rooms. Some hung colorful screens, others hung calligraphy and paintings, some designed their rooms like homes, and others hinted at transience. Some emphasized elegance, while others were rich in aesthetic ideas. Some offered fruits to the guests, while others provided paper and pens to solicit inscriptions. It was a kaleidoscope of sights. There were probably hundreds of visitors. The female students of the university were the first to arrive and were full of praise for the rooms. The simplicity of Room 118 was particularly attractive to the guests. The fragrance of clothes and hair added to the charm of the new dormitory.</p>
<p>The Women's Dormitory under the Gaze of Ten Thousand Eyes: Although Jiaotong University has had female students for three years, there has been little interaction between the male and female students. Their dormitory is located in a remote northeast corner, which some have called the "Cold Palace." It has never been open for public viewing in the past three years. This time, to celebrate the anniversary, it was opened for public viewing for one day for the first time ever. Upon entering, the instructor, Ms. Wu Peizi, greeted the guests. Upon ascending the stairs, Ms. Wang Hengling served as the hostess and guided the tour of three rooms. The rooms were richly decorated, and the design was unique. Upon asking for further details, it was said that the other rooms were locked. So-called open viewing was only a small part of the whole. The women's dormitory was originally a faculty residence, so the rooms were not uniform in size, and the buildings were old. The construction of a new women's dormitory seems to be a pressing matter.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Entertainment: The afternoon was for entertainment, and there were many programs. The two-person play was the most humorous. Later, a Westerner played the hand organ, and a Western woman played the piano. Their music was excellent. Afterwards, there were fire stick dances and other performances. The evening performance was Beijing opera. Mr. Zhang Zhifu's "Black Windkerchief" was the most eye-catching. There were many female guests in attendance, and order was maintained.</p>
<p>Night Scene Approaching Paradise: When the lights came on, the scene at Jiaotong University changed again. Colored lanterns were strung from the main gate around the playground to the new dormitory. From a distance, they looked like stars. The clock tower and flagpole were illuminated by colorful electric lights. The beauty was beyond description. At that time, women with mist-like hair and swaying skirts walked slowly on the paths. Whispers and chirps filled the flower shadows. This scene was almost not of this world. The show ended at midnight, and the grand event was declared closed.</p>
<h3 id="e230">A Record of Lingering Spring at Fragrant Sea <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>Early in mid-spring. Wind and rain persisted for weeks. The spring colors were marred by dust. How could one not lament the erosion of spring? The plum garden's floral affairs were mostly unappreciated. Yesterday, at the invitation of Zheng Zhongxiu, an old friend and head of the Jiangnan Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau, I also eagerly thought to visit the garden, as if visiting an old friend I had not seen for a long time. I was also accompanied by Zhang Yunsheng. The three of us drove there. Upon arrival and entering, the scenery of Fragrant Sea was only half or a little more of its former glory. The branches in sight were either sparse or dense, like glimpsing only half of Consort Xu's face. Only the traces of snow on the path and the subtle fragrance filled the air, making all the passing guests like Xun Ling. We chatted casually over tea outside the Song Bin Hall. Zhongxiu said that he would soon be transferred to Yangzhou and would be temporarily separated from the lake and mountains of Xidi, fearing that the two-thirds of the bright moon would evoke dreams of ten thousand plum trees. Therefore, he proposed taking a photograph to commemorate the occasion. I readily expressed my agreement, not only to capture the spring scenery but also to console his longing for the clouds and trees in the future. So, we chose a spot on the lawn in front of Tianxin Terrace and took a photograph together. The figures among the flowers were either sitting or standing, with a peculiar rock adorning the side. The solitary peak stood out, adding to the uninhibited charm. Thus, I inscribed four poems:</p>
<p>Cherishing old friendships in this famous garden, comforting hearts at the edge of the world.</p>
<p>Spring is on the branches, birds its artisans.</p>
<p>My slender shadow is like that of the Kun crane.</p>
<p>I have come to the mountains to accompany the plum blossoms.</p>
<p>Just now emerging from the snow-covered sea, leaving traces of mud,</p>
<p>Like a wild goose flying from beyond the sky, leaving an occasional footprint.</p>
<p>Do not lament the late arrival, the flowers half-fallen,</p>
<p>A wisp of lingering fragrance transforms into a soul of verse.</p>
<p>A delicate stone bears witness to three lifetimes,</p>
<p>Pine and bamboo have an old pact with plum blossoms.</p>
<p>Smiling, I point to the vastness of Lake Tai,</p>
<p>Cherishing this parting for you, recording deep affection.</p>
<p>Zheng Zhuang's heroic spirit gladly pauses his carriage,</p>
<p>Zhang Xu, joining the excursion, is equally delighted.</p>
<p>From here to Yangzhou, moonlit nights will bring,</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the spring colors in dreams of Jiangnan.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Discovery of Mongolian Artifacts and Ancient Books <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jun</p>
<p>A friend of mine has been doing business in Mongolia for many years. He sent a letter the other day, recounting the discovery of ancient artifacts and books in Mongolia. It was fascinating, so I have excerpted it below.</p>
<p>Last year, the Russian Oriental Exploration Team, led by Gao Siluo, ventured into the Gobi Desert and other parts of Mongolia. It was deep winter, and the weather was bitterly cold. Gao Siluofu temporarily returned to Moscow, while many of his assistants continued their work, searching for ancient ruins and strange objects. Soon, they discovered an ancient tomb. They began to excavate it. Deep within the tomb, they found a white alum stone coffin. Upon opening it, they found floral felt hangings, various silk items, and many gold, silver, pearl, and jade ornaments. The carvings and workmanship were extremely exquisite, seemingly beyond the capabilities of modern artisans. Finally, they unearthed seven hundred volumes of ancient handwritten books.</p>
<p>The handwriting was small and faintly discernible. The books were written in seven different languages, but only the Chinese and Indian scripts could be identified. The remaining ancient books could not be deciphered. The books were lined with silk brocade and meticulously bound. The book chests were engraved with the inscription "Identified in the third year of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty in the second month." Since obtaining these books, the exploration team has treasured them as priceless gems. It is said that they will be taken back to the ancient artifact preservation center in the Russian capital along with the floral felt hangings and ornaments for display.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Random Notes on Mei Lanfang’s American Tour from the Zhuiyu Pavilion <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Lai</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang’s acting made me think of Greek drama. There are discussions of Greek drama in ancient books that are often difficult to understand. Now, watching Mei Lanfang’s acting, I suddenly have some understanding.</p>
<p>The acting in Chinese opera is very real, but not in a photographic sense. It’s an artistic reality that makes the audience feel it is even more real than the original.</p>
<p>My favorite opera to watch is "Assassinating the Tiger," which has a historical and literary atmosphere. The suicide scene is particularly well done.</p>
<p>The acting of most American playwrights feels stiff. Mei Lanfang's acting, from the movement of his eyes to the movement of his sleeves, is just right. His postures are lively and completely free of stiffness.</p>
<p>Some people think that facial expressions should be realistic, but they are not. They also have a set of rules and changes. They are definitely not aimed at superficial expressions of violent emotions.</p>
<p>The placement of each character on the stage in Chinese opera is very good. Mei’s standing position changes from time to time (such as moving forward or backward), but it is always in the most appropriate place. Each change gives the audience a fresh perspective, keeping them from getting tired. Mei's eyebrow makeup is excellent. The arrangement of white, black, and red is like the beauty of ancient porcelain. As for his postures of bowing, looking up, sitting, and standing, they are all similar to ancient paintings.</p>
<p>I have no problem with Mei's falsetto singing. I think the difference between Mei's falsetto and a woman's real voice is equivalent to the difference between imitating a woman's posture in opera and a woman's natural movements. It can be said to be purely artistic. Listening to it, there is no unpleasant feeling.</p>
<p>After Yang Jun's criticism, he asked Wan Hua if there were any errors. Wan said, "The criticism is very appropriate, but I dare not accept it." He repeatedly inquired about various rules of Chinese opera. Wan answered them one by one. Hearing this, Jun slapped the table and exclaimed, calling it true drama. The above is what Yang Jun said, which has not yet been reported, so I have described it in detail. The other New York newspapers often have reports, too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of Wan Hua's performances, ten new plays have been staged within a week. However, their box office sales are not as good as Wan Hua's. The currently sold tickets are being resold for as much as eight dollars. Considering the current situation in New York, this price is not easy to achieve. However, the general opinion is that we could still fill the seats even if we raised the price to eight dollars. Several of the largest theaters have come to negotiate. One theater (i.e., the National Theater) can hold about a thousand seats. An agreement has been reached, and the performances will move there in the third week. Prices may be set differently in the future.</p>

<p>Chapter Ten: Fiery Flames Rise, Laneway Praises Filial Daughter; Red Carpet Laid, Famous Performers Met on the Spot</p>
<p>Ruiyun said, "Alright, stop trying to whet my appetite. If you say it's good, why wouldn't I go?" A-Jin said, "What new opera is it? Does the stage have all sorts of scenery? Is there a curtain in front of the stage that pulls open, revealing all sorts of scenery that looks just like the real thing?" Zuo Shichen said, "That's right. There are all sorts of unconventional new operas these days. They're gradually becoming popular in Shanghai. They have scenery, curtains, gongs and drums, and singing. It's something called 'neither fish nor fowl.' Theirs is a purely new opera. They've been practicing for months. It's not like those sloppy ones. Anyone can jump on stage and do it. They don't practice at all on weekdays. When it comes time to perform, they end up saying things that don't make sense. This is a real new opera!" Hearing this, A-Jin became even more excited and said, "Little Miss, the new opera is much better than the old opera. They don't have gongs, drums, or singing. They just talk, so it's much easier for us to understand. With those old operas, we don't know what they're singing. If they sing for too long, I'm going to fall asleep in the theater! People who understand singing find it interesting. We don't understand singing. We don't know what they're saying. As for those martial arts plays, we only see red-faced and black-faced people fighting, tumbling, and doing handstands. They're fun to watch, but they keep doing the same old tricks. On the other hand, those new operas have a good plot. We can understand every sentence they say clearly. And it's a complete play from beginning to end. It's not just a piece here and a section there. Second Young Master, if you're inviting Little Miss, I want to go too!" Zuo Shichen said, "Of course. You're indispensable. You're Little Miss's military attendant. Of course, I have to invite you." A-Jin didn't know what a military attendant was. She also said, "When the time comes, we have to be prepared early. But even if Big Aunt lets Ruiyun go to the opera, she'll still follow the old rule. The donation songs still have to come to the theater. So, right when it's getting good, the solicitation ticket will come again. It would be best to tell her mother that day that no matter who comes to ask for donation songs, they don't have to come. Just tell the two of them to take their place." Ruiyun said, "It doesn't matter. If they write out that they want me to go, they'll still come." Zuo Shichen said, "It doesn't matter. When the time comes, I guarantee that no one will come. I'll let you watch from beginning to end without being disturbed. Ruiyun said, "Really? If that's the case, I'll really have to thank you. But how do I tell my mother? I'm afraid she won't agree." Zuo Shichen said, "You don't have to worry about it. I have a way. It's a secret. I can't tell you in advance. When the time comes, I'll make sure you can watch the opera in peace."</p>

<h3 id="e234">Gold Price Barely Holds at Five Hundred Taels <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, April 1st, the gold market seemed to be fluctuating, with highs and lows. The morning market saw differences of over three taels, while the afternoon market fluctuated by only two taels, eventually falling slightly, but remaining just outside the 500-tael mark. Foreign exchange weakened slightly. Banks saw some buying and selling. Among the traders, supply exceeded demand. Shunli and Yu Da both bought, while Taixing and Yuansheng sold. Since the morning market was sluggish and did not move, the opening was slightly higher. However, the sellers were agile and briefly broke through the 500-tael mark, falling from over 502 taels to between 499 taels. Exchange rates also loosened slightly. Banks bought forward Japanese gold at only 1.0425 taels, and British gold at 11 pence 375 to 4375. Later, Hengxing, Wanxing, and Shunli were all buyers, while Yu Da and others had already sold. Initially, sellers seemed to be more numerous, leading to weakness. However, banks then purchased spot gold, and buyers on the floor increased, suddenly pushing the price above 500 taels. Exchange rates also stabilized, and sentiment improved. However, the price of silver bars in London did not change, and the silver price only increased by 0.125. Exchange rates did not move.</p>
<p>Opening Rises Six Mace: The opening for May gold was higher by six mace, at 502 taels and two mace. The gross margin fell from two mace and four candareens to one mace and four candareens, but sellers did not relent. The official announcement of no change came, with the internal market at two mace. Dalian Mitsui absorbed 1.051875 taels, and bought June British gold at 11 pence 3125. Shortly after, it retreated slightly, but only by a few candareens. After 10:30, the price gradually declined, likely due to the weakening of Japanese gold. Sumitomo bought forward contracts at 1.0425 taels, and Mitsui bought near-term British gold at 11 pence 25 and far-term at 11 pence 375. By 11:30, the price had fallen by over two taels, to only 99 taels. However, Taixing, Yuansheng, and others were eager to sell. After their entry, the price rose by six or seven candareens, reaching 9 taels and 67 candareens at 11:45. At noon closing, it was 9 taels and 50 candareens.</p>
<p>Result: Down Eight Candareens: The afternoon market opened at 9 taels and 90 candareens, due to a large opening for goods. Before long, it declined by one tael, due to active selling. It suddenly fell to 98 taels and 90 candareens. At this time, Erjing absorbed July British gold at 11 pence 4375, and the China Bank mutually traded this month's contracts at 11 pence 3125. After 2:30, various banks mutually traded at 11 pence 25. With the addition of Yongchengchang, Hengxing, and others buying, the price rose by about two taels. Then, news came that Indian exchange rates were shrinking, boosting morale. However, the Japanese bank had sold 1.05 taels of Japanese gold this month. After 4:00, they added another two taels, breaking through the 500-tael mark, reaching 0.0089 taels. At the 4:20 closing, it was 500 taels and 0.008 candareens, down eight candareens from the previous day.</p>
<p>Closing Price Ends Down by About Five Taels: The highest price of the day was 502 taels and four candareens, and the lowest price was 498 taels and nine candareens, a difference of three taels and five candareens. The listed price was still 515 taels and four candareens, down about 13 or 14 taels. At noon, it was down by as much as 16 taels. The water price for settling accounts was 500 taels. The afternoon listed price was adjusted down by 15 or 16 taels. Finally, it was around 15 taels, and the water price was 501 taels. The opening price for goods was two taels and one candareen in the morning, 99 taels and 50 candareens at noon, and 9 taels and 80 candareens in the afternoon, closing at 500 taels and 0.009 candareens.</p>
<p>Speculators Sell Off Considerably: Traders bought and sold. Zhifeng Yong, Taixing, Yuansheng, Dade Sheng, Yuanda, Yuanmaoyong, and Yuanchengyong all sold. Yuda Shunli, Fuchang, and Yifeng Yong all bought. In the afternoon, Hengxing, Xiangyu, Yongchengchang, Wanxing, Shunli, and Yuankangxiang all bought.

<p>Results Weaken... Trading Inactive</p>
<p>Yesterday's HSBC Exchange Rates: Except for Hong Kong, which decreased by 0.25 to 80 taels, the rest showed no increase or decrease. The large contracts did not change.

Kobe was not good in the morning, but fell in the afternoon. Local foreign exchange rates were firm in the morning but weakened at noon. The afternoon was slightly calmer. Overall, it was difficult to break through the 500-tael range. Eventually, it weakened slightly. Compared to the previous day, British gold was flat, US dollars increased slightly by 0.0625, and Japanese gold decreased by 0.125. Chinese merchants' trading was not very strong, with 40,000 to 50,000 pounds of British gold sold. Mitsui's appetite was not bad, and various banks mutually traded 50,000 to 60,000 pounds and paired off $100,000, with $100,000 sold by Sumitomo and Makali. Chinese merchants sold tens of thousands of Japanese gold. Sumitomo and Mitsui absorbed some, and purchased 100,000 to 200,000 in the afternoon. Mitsui and Chosen sold. Hedging was not smooth. Sentiment was stable, and market sentiment seemed to change slightly.</p>

<h3 id="e237">Options Trading Stalls, No Hope for Turnaround in Interest Rates <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: This year, the informal suspension of both the late third and early fourth month options trading has resulted in a chaotic convergence of spot silver prices. Although there have been no extraordinary surges, there have also been few drastic drops. The daily price has generally remained at the 7 mace 2 candareen mark, but the volume of trading has varied from time to time. It is known that this is not due to formal demand. As for the state of the money supply, given the current cautious and thorough consideration by silver and money traders, it is difficult to see significant development. The market appears to be superficially active, without any actual significant fluctuations worth reporting. The market for all auxiliary coins has lacked both sales and supply for a long time, so the daily price has remained unchanged, without any changes.</p>
<p>Interest Rates: (Silver Interest) The supply and demand in the morning and afternoon markets are equal, making it difficult for prices to rise or fall significantly. The price remained at 7 mace 1 candareen 9 lin 8 hao 7 hu and a half, the same as the previous day's noon price. The current market price is like a carved block, without any daily changes, which is against human nature. (Silver Discount) The morning and afternoon markets both opened at 5%, seemingly 0.2 better than the previous day. The market has been soft throughout, and the money supply has never been so loose for so long.</p>
<p>Auxiliary Coin Market: Jiangnan small coins were priced at 6 mace 1 candareen 6 lin in the morning, and suddenly increased by 0.035 in the afternoon, to 6 mace 1 candareen 9 lin 5 hao. However, it is unknown whether the increase is due to slight customer demand. Trading volume was 2,500 jiao in the morning and 12,000 jiao in the afternoon. Guangdong small coins differed by only 0.005 between the morning and afternoon markets. The morning price was 5 mace 9 candareen 6 lin, and the afternoon price was 0.0065. Trading volume was 100,500 jiao in the morning and 85,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins increased by another 1,500 wen, to 396,500 wen. Trading volume was 34,500 strings.</p>
<p>Silver and Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: (Silver) Yesterday, the banks' silver inflow was much lower than the previous day. Chinese merchants received over 1.9 million in remittances, foreign merchants received over 1.67 million, and various goods, foreign exchange taxes, and other items totaled over 8 million. Special outflows totaled over 800,000, and warehouse outflows totaled 1.3 million. Japanese banks received over 3.1 million in various items and had warehouse outflows of 300,000. Money shops and silver firms received over 28.8 million in single remittances, over 2.9 million in clearing remittances, and over 1.3 million in remittances from various routes, with over 100,000 in cash received. (Silver Dollar) The morning market for exchange remittances totaled 1.48 million, and the afternoon market totaled 490,000. The morning market for banknotes was 5,000, and there was no trading in the afternoon. The morning market for Zhongshan new coins was 5,000, and only 50,000 were traded in the afternoon, all at a premium of 0.005. The morning market for off-market banknotes was 114,000, and the afternoon market was 47,000. Bank buying and selling totaled 500,000 each in the morning and afternoon. The inflow and outflow of foreign accounts between banks totaled over 1.1 million, and the inflow and outflow of banknotes totaled over 1 million. Money shops and silver firms received over 4.22 million in single foreign currency, over 1.1 million in foreign currency clearing remittances, and over 700,000 in foreign currency loans. Small money shops saw inflows and outflows of banknotes, exchange remittances, spot silver, and new coins totaling 400,000 to 500,000. Over 300,000 were shipped from the Yangtze River by customers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there was little spot trading of public debt. Only the Rehabilitation and Disbandment bonds opened in the morning, and there were no transactions in the afternoon. The futures market was active. At the beginning of the morning, selling was strong, and the continued trading in Rehabilitation, Customs, and Disbandment bonds caused them to fall by one to one and a half yuan. However, as sentiment stabilized slightly, buying suddenly increased, and bond prices rebounded. As a result, Rehabilitation bonds rebounded by 0.8 yuan compared to the previous day, and continued trading in Customs bonds also rebounded by 0.6 to 0.7 yuan. Other fluctuations were slight, and there were mixed gains and losses. The total spot trading for the day was only 2,000 yuan, and the total futures trading reached over 7.75 million yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e240">Yarn Factories Increase Orders, Yarn Market Rises Sharply <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market rose sharply and rapidly due to consistent price increases in overseas cotton yarn, leading to a slight settling of sentiment. A certain manufacturer, bullish on the market, purchased four lots this month, totaling approximately 2,500 bales. As a result, the outstanding balance on the floor was depleted, creating a temporary shortage. This triggered a shift in sentiment and a tightening of the market, leading to stronger buying interest. According to some sources, a certain manufacturer is transferring 3,000 bales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn to another manufacturer, leading to a slightly firm attitude. Sales to Niuzhuang in the north are relatively active. Currently, due to the thick underlying inventory, sellers are not letting up. The future remains dependent on actual sales and the evolving situation.</p>
<p>Broker #1 Aggressively Absorbs This Month's Yarn: At the opening of the morning session, although foreign cotton was up, most people were still bearish. Unexpectedly, Broker #1 collected yarn limited to nine taels in the current month, pulling up the far-month contracts. The second lot was also in the current month, but the far-month contracts fell sharply. The third lot was also purchased in the current month, clearing the floor and causing prices to suddenly rise at the close. As a result, prices rose by one tael and seven mace to one tael and one candareen across all months. The market remained firm in the afternoon, with sellers reducing their activity. Scattered traders covered short positions, and prices rose again by 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.8 mace across all months. Total trading volume for the day was 20,900 bales. The closing prices for the Zhong brokers are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Zhong Closing Prices Change Balance in Account July 1518 Up 1.7 22 800</p>
<p>April 1500 Up 1.9 42,200 Aug. 1522 16 18 210</p>
<p>May 1499 14 36 300 Sept. 1528 8</p>
<p>June 1508 13 16 650</p>
<p>Purchases by Niuzhuang Traders are Relatively Frequent: Current yarn sales are still good, and the buying interest from Niuzhuang is strong. Total purchases by all traders for the day were 1,280 bales, with traders accounting for 300 bales. The market sentiment is slightly firm. Among the customer traders, Niuzhuang was the most active, accounting for 630 bales, with 200 bales for the mainland, 30 bales for Jiangxi, 185 bales for Guangdong, 105 bales for Zhenjiang, 50 bales for Sichuan, and 7,000 bales for miscellaneous traders.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Cotton Market Covering Shorts with Furious Rise <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market's rise is dramatic, led by the upward trend in American cotton. Retail investors are active in covering short positions, and one major player has also suffered significant losses from being short, leading to a dry market and increasingly sharp price increases. Dealers in Chinese cotton are taking a firm stance, holding back and not moving goods. Overall, the cotton market has too little stock on hand and a lack of supply. When foreign cotton strengthens, the price rise naturally becomes even more robust.</p>
<p>Han Standard Rises Sharply by 5.5 Candareens: In the morning session, the Han Standard opened higher, following the rise in foreign cotton, and the situation became even firmer. Prices for all months rose by an average of 4.5 candareens. A major player covered 5,000 bales of short positions. In the afternoon, the market remained tight, with prices for all months rising by another 0.05 to 0.1 candareens. Total turnover for the day was 39,100 bales, worth 30,000 yuan. The closing prices for Han Standard are recorded below:</p>

<p>June: 35.10, up 0.50, 77,300</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Market Steady Sales, Dull Quiet: The spot cotton business is flat, with factory offices showing sluggish interest. Incoming goods included 700 bales of Yao cotton and 520 bales of Tong cotton. Sales records are listed below:</p>

<p>American Cotton Skyrockets, Covering Shorts Triggers a Rise of Over 30 Pounds: Yesterday, American cotton initially remained firm due to a lack of sellers. Later, due to purchases by spot traders and short covering, it gradually rose. Futures rose by 20 to 35 points, and spot prices rose by 35 points. English cotton futures rose by 7 to 9 points, and spot prices rose by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. Indian cotton saw a strong market due to the rise in American cotton and purchases by speculative heavyweights. Pingguoer futures for both near and distant months rose by 8 rupees, Aomula futures for both near and distant months rose by 7 rupees, Bairuoxi rose by 4 rupees, and distant months rose by 5 rupees.

<h3 id="e243">Grains: Increased Supply in the Hexia Rice Market <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>General Market Still Tight</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the number of boats arriving at various wharves increased, numbering around 40. Sales were very brisk. After days of quiet, shops saw a good supply and rushed to buy. The market remained tight. However, high-quality goods stabilized. Top-grade northern japonica rice inevitably had some behind-the-scenes price adjustments. Mid-range goods were slightly firmer at their original levels. As for lower-quality goods, they stood very firm. Judging from the day's situation, japonica rice may fluctuate slightly. The reason for the rise is that after the river channels opened, incoming goods could barely meet demand. However, prices are also unlikely to fall due to cost factors. Arrivals of thin indica rice were scarce, and demand was weak. Prices remained unchanged. However, high-quality goods had reached 19 yuan outside the customs. Sheep's belly glutinous rice from Hexia was being received in small quantities. Sales on this street were quite active, and prices rose slightly. Sales of Baiyuan rice were also active, but with more goods available, there were neither gains nor losses.</p>
<p>Hunan: Over ten boats arrived from Hexia. Merchants on this street showed great interest, and the buying interest in machine-milled japonica rice from the northern route, such as Changshu and Xixi, was excellent. The prices of various goods continued to increase following the previous day's rise, but the situation felt more moderate. The market for thin indica and early rice from the southern region, such as Jinze, Fengjing, and Liantang, remained strong. This was mainly due to the scarcity of stock and the active interest of shops. Prices were tightening, but the rise in these goods in the previous few markets had been excessive, so although sales were strong yesterday, transactions decreased slightly. Because the price of Yangbu glutinous rice was approaching the price of foreign rice, shops and merchants were mostly taking a wait-and-see approach, with only sporadic transactions. Market prices were firm. Tongbian Yinyuan rice also followed suit and rose. Sales in the market felt very flat.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Reversal After High Prices of Foreign Rice <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Spot Prices Fall Slightly by 10-20 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, two ships of foreign rice arrived. Because sales were weak and some mainland merchants were returning goods, and merchants on this street were also observing due to the arrival of goods for sale, only 4,000 bags were traded in the overall market. Prices fell slightly by 10-20 cents. The reason for the sudden and drastic changes in the market is that many ships had arrived in recent days, and foreign merchants had long been selling forward contracts. Now that these contracts were being fulfilled one after another, there was little concern for the spot goods on the market. Secondly, robberies were frequently occurring on roads in various regions, and distant mainland merchants also had concerns. Thirdly, after market prices rose repeatedly, everyone had a sense of high risk. Once there was a surge in arrivals, a reversal occurred. Over 2,000 tons of forward contracts were traded, and prices also fell slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Reasons for the Trend Towards Flatness in the Flour Market <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Weak Northern Sales... Market Prices Too High</p>
<p>Manufacturers Selling Short... Bulls Cautious</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was generally flat and sluggish. Although the stock levels of various factories were not very high, actual sales in the north were indeed quiet. The price of flour at around 5.5 candareens was not cost-effective in Tianjin, and the chaotic situation made actual sales hesitant. Small and medium-sized manufacturers accounted for a significant portion of the shorts for April. If the squeeze becomes too high, they will inevitably have to release all their spot goods into the exchange. Judging from the warehouse receipts for the previous month, there were only 50,000 bags, and the market had already been affected. If the remaining manufacturers also follow suit, the bulls will inevitably suffer a major blow. The trend towards flatness in the market is also due to this reason. As a result, the price for this month was 0.05 candareens lower than at the end of the previous month, 0.1 candareens lower for May, 0.05 candareens lower for June, 0.1 candareens lower for July and August, and 2.2975 taels was initially opened in September, but fell by 0.1 candareens in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Mixed Rise and Fall of Wheat Futures <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of wheat futures in the morning, various months showed mixed rises and falls. With foreign wheat reported at a slight decrease of 0.345 candareens, people inevitably had doubts. Trading for this month was still smooth, but both sides were evenly matched. Currently, with sluggish flour sales, buyers felt slightly at a disadvantage. It will be difficult to determine the winner until the time of delivery. The sentiment of mainland merchants for June was very good, and the market continued to be strong. The trend for July and August was flat. The initial opening for September was 4.46 taels, and then the sentiment of mainland merchants was also good, and it tended to be stable. As a result, the price for this month was 0.01 candareens lower than at the end of the previous month, 0.02 candareens higher for June, 0.01 candareens lower for July, unchanged for August, and 0.02 candareens higher for September compared to the initial opening. The spot wheat market was stable, but factory offices were very active due to the selling of flour. Yesterday, Qingjiangpu wheat was opened at 5.11 taels, Suzhou wheat at 5.11 taels, totaling 3,000 bags. Shashi wheat was 4.9 taels, down to 4.66 taels, Jiangxi wheat was 5.03 taels, down to 4.9 taels, Hankou wheat was 4.7 taels, totaling 5,000 bags, which were purchased by Fuxin Huafeng and other factory offices.</p>

<p>Actual Sales Even More Dull</p>
<p>Yesterday, the textile market suddenly experienced drastic changes. The surge in prices of Eastern goods was truly rare in recent years. The reason was that the prices of Sampin were rising steadily, and the Eastern exchange rate was extremely high, with prices exceeding spot prices by a large margin. In addition, the inventory in Shanghai was gradually becoming depleted, and merchants holding goods had high costs. Therefore, opening prices leaped sky high. Yesterday, Gucheng Hui fine serge opened at 2.775 candareens, Baoqiu at 2.725 candareens, Fengbo Pavilion at 2.475 candareens, Huxin Pavilion at 2.35 candareens, Moganshan, Hunting Goose, Muqiu, and Tribute Neli all opened at 2.65 candareens, Guangxie Zijinshan gray scarf at 4.8 taels, Lovely Beauty ocean blue at 4.9 taels, Flower Standard increased by 0.5 candareens, Chongsu silk rose by 0.025 candareens, and the First Grade Tribute Satin opened at 2.6 candareens. The market situation was extremely chaotic, but actual sales were still lackluster due to the impact of the situation. Therefore, after the price increase, it became even more quiet, with only those in urgent need making some additional purchases. Western goods remained stable. Merchants on this street purchased over 20 pieces of printed Fuchou. Laibei Dragon Boat Association was 4.75 candareens, and Fengyu Yibenwanli was 4.5 candareens. Bleached cloth was also quite active due to the sales season.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Silk and Tea: Chinese and Foreign Thrown Silk Contract Has Been Revised <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>In the local Shanghai Chinese and foreign raw silk trade, there was originally a contract for thrown silk futures, which had been mutually adhered to for a long time. However, Chinese silk merchants had suffered considerable losses over the decades due to the restrictions of the contract's terms. Taking advantage of the reorganization of the foreign merchants' silk association into an export silk association (because the contract was signed between Chinese merchants and the foreign merchants' silk association), they requested revisions. Now, the two most important clauses have been mutually negotiated and revised: (1) The payment for silk shipped on Saturdays will be made on the morning of that day, without having to wait until the following Monday to make the payment; (2) For every five pieces of silk, only two strands of sample silk are allowed to be drawn for inspection, and restrictions are shown to prevent arbitrary drawing. The sample silk must also be given a receipt. After inspection, the Chinese merchant will take the receipt to the foreign firm to retrieve it, and weigh its weight in person to avoid damage. The new revised clauses have been implemented as of yesterday (April 1st).</p>

<p>Price Pulling Increases Sharply by 5-10 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firm silk market reported another continued increase. The reason is that the stock of cocoons is limited and insufficient to replace the old, while European and American white silk factories have strong demand, and the exchange rate is also firm, so market prices continue to rise. Yesterday, Landale &amp; Clark and others purchased 90 bales of Shanghai white silk, and Xinfu and others purchased 12 bales of yellow reeling silk. Prices all increased sharply by 5-10 taels.</p>

<h3 id="e253">A History of General Motors' Development Over the Past Twenty Years: Huang Yingdai <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>In late November of last year, the American General Motors Company held a shareholder meeting on 57th Street in New York, discussing the distribution of dividends. It was said that the dividends distributed by General Motors in recent years are richer than any factory in any country in the world. Even in terms of last year's profits alone, the net profit was 150%. The dividends distributed to the shareholders amounted to 43,500,400 yuan. In addition, the bonuses for employees and the dividends for shareholders also amounted to 43,500,000 yuan. Before Christmas, the shareholders all came to the company to receive their dividends. After this news spread, people in society were all amazed. This is because General Motors has only been established for twenty years, and even eight years ago, people in general could not say for sure whether General Motors would be permanently established or would be dissolved. The establishment of General Motors occupies an important position in the American automotive industry. To trace the origin, credit must be given to W.C. Durant. When Durant was engaged in the automotive business, it was still in its infancy. People in general did not have much faith in the automotive business. Therefore, if it were not for Durant's spirit of fearless courage and tireless efforts, General Motors would not have achieved its current success. Durant had foresight. When he started, he first bought the Buick factory and devoted himself to managing and reorganizing it. In a few years, the Buick cars produced by the factory had a completely new look and were no longer as crude as in the past. At that time, the Buick factory was located in Flint, Michigan. Horse-drawn carriage bodies, automobile engines, and bicycles, as well as all parts, were manufactured. At that time, the model was just beginning to take shape, and the equipment was simple. Compared with today, it is like heaven and earth. The organization of the new factory began in 1909, only a little over twenty years ago. It has gone through many twists and turns. It was not until eight years ago that the vehicles produced began to become popular around the world.</p>
<p>Durant handled all matters in the factory in an orderly manner and managed them well. All who knew him admired him. He was someone who enjoyed investing and also had new ideas. From 1905 to 1910, Durant devoted all his efforts to managing the Buick factory. After that, he entered General Motors. In 1910, General Motors' annual sales were 50,000,000 yuan, with a net profit of 10,000,000 yuan. During the war, General Motors' business developed greatly due to special circumstances. In 1917, the value of vehicles sold throughout the year reached 172,000,000 yuan. After that, it flourished day by day and developed year by year. In 1918, it was 270,000,000 yuan, and in 1920, it reached 567,000,000 yuan. However, 1921 was an unlucky year, and the company almost went bankrupt. The highest net profit in previous years was over 70,000,000 yuan. During the decline, the losses suffered were also over 38,680,000 yuan. General Motors was able to continue to exist and avoid bankruptcy because it had accumulated generous profits over the years, and its capital was so strong that it was difficult to find a large capitalist to invest in purchasing it.</p>
<p>After that, the company made every effort to reorganize and reform, and managed it diligently, which led to today's success. The company was able to grasp the leading position in the world's automotive business. At the beginning of General Motors' reforms, the main goal was to produce cars quickly, increase the quantity, and reform the manufacturing of parts using scientific methods. As a result, sales increased rapidly. The reason why General Motors has achieved today's success is not because of its strong capital or the large number of its factories. The main reason is that it used people properly. Most of the employees used in the various factories have rich knowledge, sufficient experience, and the ability to handle affairs is unmatched by the employees of any factory. Therefore, they are able to use scientific methods to reform the old machines and adopt new machines to manufacture various vehicles. As a result, the performance of the vehicles produced is better than other factories. People in society are happy to buy them, and sales have also increased greatly. General Motors' success today should be attributed to Durant. This has already been mentioned above. However, in addition to Durant, there is another person who should be mentioned to the readers, namely Alfred P. Sloan Jr. Since 1920, he has been the manager of General Motors. He graduated from a university in his youth. His ability to handle affairs is no less than Durant's. Therefore, these two are the cornerstones of General Motors.</p>
<p>When General Motors was founded, up to 1909, the value of vehicles sold in twelve months was 29,000,000 yuan, and the net profit was 9,000,000 yuan. At that time, people in the automotive industry did not believe that after that, the vehicles sold by General Motors would exceed 29,000,000 yuan. However, today's sales volume, even in the last three months of last year, is forty times the annual volume of 1909. General Motors has only been established for a little over twenty years. This has already been mentioned above. However, in these twenty years, its progress has been faster than we expected. To date, its capital is abundant and its power is great, with no match. In terms of capital, it currently has 1,200,000 US dollars. The number of employees in the factory has also reached 2,000,000. The annual production of trucks and buses has reached 2,000,000 vehicles. How could this have been foreseen by people twenty years ago? Moreover, General Motors' engineering has always had surprising and successful points, such as the abolition of horsepower and the use of gasoline, and the adoption of current systems, all of which were first invented. It is because of this that it has been able to enjoy fame to this day.</p>
<p>Since 1921, General Motors' business has grown even faster. In 1923, the total value of vehicles sold throughout the year was 700,000,000 yuan, and in 1926, it reached 1,000,000,000 yuan. In 1927, it was 1,269,519,673 yuan. As for last year's sales, they were even more alarming. In the previous nine months alone, the number of vehicles sold was 1,600,000, including trucks and buses. If accurate statistics are used, then in the entire United States, including women and children, General Motors sold one car for every 75 people in nine months. Until the year before last, General Motors' products accounted for one-third of all cars in the United States. Currently, the number of employees employed in the factory has reached 210,000, which is not far from the number of workers used by the American Iron and Steel Company, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. The total number of workers employed by the above-mentioned four major factories has reached 1,000,000. In addition, General Motors' agents currently number 20,000. In recent years, General Motors has developed so rapidly, and its position has become increasingly stable. The main reason for the recent rapid progress of the automotive business in the United States is the increase in population, and most families have two cars. In addition, the damage of old cars and the purchase of new cars also increase sales. Generally, a car is no longer usable after seven and a half years. The development of overseas trade in recent years has also increased General Motors' sales. According to historical records, the value of General Motors' cars exported in 1926 was 98,000,000 yuan, and in 1927, it was 172,000,000 yuan. As for last year's overseas trade, according to General Motors' prior estimates, it should be 260,000,000 yuan. This number is equal to the total number of cars produced by General Motors in the years before 1918.</p>
<p>General Motors' factories are located in various countries around the world. Including the merchants who sell them, there are currently 6,000 locations. Its influence has reached more than 100 countries. Therefore, the development of overseas sales is due to the large number of factories and managers. Moreover, General Motors' vehicles are not shipped directly as assembled cars. They are mostly assembled by local factories. General Motors has recently discovered that it is more economical to assemble vehicles abroad, and the price can be slightly lower. Therefore, it decided to use the factory system. Recalling 1924, General Motors first established a factory in Copenhagen. Since then, factories have continued to be established in various places. To date, there are factories in London, Paris, Stockholm, Antwerp, Berlin, Madrid, Alexandria, Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo, Brisbane, Wellington, Osaka, Batavia, South Africa, and other places. Therefore, car sales have not yet reached China, Japan, India, and other eastern countries. General Motors' vehicles can also be seen everywhere. In fact, whether it is in high plateaus or low swamps, deep mountains or secluded valleys, General Motors' cars can be found almost everywhere. Although people of all colors speak different languages, their faith in General Motors' cars is the same. Therefore, General Motors' automotive business still has endless hopes. Let us wait and see.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Methods for Railroad Car Switching on the Pinghan Railway (Continued) by Zheng Baozhao <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Next, let's discuss the railways of other countries.</p>
<p>Aside from England and America, other countries that implement the train dispatching system include all of the Norwegian &amp; Swedish State Railways, major Belgian State Railways, the French Eastern Railway, the Paris-Lyons-Mediterranean Railway, and the Paris-Orleans Railway, as well as the Madri-Sarayas-slaicante Railway in Spain. What is noteworthy is that the dispatchers of the Madri-Sarayas-slaicante Railway do not participate in any train operation matters. Their primary duty is to manage the dispatch of freight cars to ensure the complete transportation of goods. When necessary, they can order the operation of auxiliary trains and pay attention to preparing the locomotives and personnel needed for these trains. In other European railways, the system can be divided into two categories: (1) The dispatching office is the sole authority for dispatching the entire section of operation. (2) The dispatching office is an organ for transmitting information. Under the first system, the sole duties of the dispatcher are as follows: (A) Before the train is assembled, determine whether it is necessary to operate auxiliary trains or special trains, considering the conditions at the originating and destination stations, the availability of motive power, and the best way to utilize motive power. Ensure that the route selected for the auxiliary train and special train does not conflict with regular trains or other trains already running on the route. After deciding to operate a train, notify the relevant stations and locomotive depots so that they can prepare the necessary locomotives and personnel in a timely manner. (2) After the train is running, if it is a double-track line, decide on switching matters or change the order of trains. If it is a single-track line, decide on the location of meeting or overtaking trains, and order the relevant stations to implement it. In case of an accident, dispatch rescue trains and arrange their itinerary. If it is a double-track line and there is an obstruction, arrange temporary single-track operation procedures. Under the second system, when the dispatching office is considered an organ for transmitting information, the decision to operate trains and various necessary arrangements after the train is running are no different from railways that do not implement a dispatching system. Railways that apply the first system include the Swedish State Railways, the Norwegian State Railways, and the Czechoslovak State Railways. As for the Paris-Orleans Railway in France, the authority of its dispatchers after the train is running is also the same. The scope of the train dispatching system in other countries' railways is generally between the first and second types. A special feature of the Belgian railway dispatching system is that the dispatcher has the right to advance the departure of freight trains when transportation conditions permit. This measure is to avoid route congestion. In addition to managing the actual operation of trains, dispatchers also handle part of the vehicle allocation matters, either as an intermediary organ between the vehicle allocation room and the station, or as the vehicle allocation organ. The dispatching office of the Belgian State Railways has a high position, with the power to manage the operation affairs of the entire line, and is directly linked to the dispatching offices of each section. All matters related to operation, such as the occurrence of any events in assembling trains and exchanging yards, as well as the waiting status of freight cars, are reported.</p>
<p>From the above concise description, it can be seen that the trend of world railways adopting the train dispatching system and the differences and similarities in their systems. The conclusions obtained from a comprehensive comparison and observation of various countries' systems, as well as the consideration of our country's situation, and the specific methods considered for reference and adoption, have been fully documented in this plan. It is not necessary to repeat them here. What has not been discussed in detail in the plan is specifically stated in the following points for further explanation:</p>
<p>(1) Organization: The centralized system and the sectionalized system each have their advantages. Which type is more advantageous for each road depends on the management system, the length of the route, and the complexity of transportation. Generally speaking, the centralized system enables the entire road to comprehensively coordinate all transportation affairs. Therefore, it is easier to achieve effectiveness in considering the transportation situation of each section, allocating vehicles, and utilizing locomotive capacity, etc. The routes of the British railways are shorter than those of various countries and territories, so the centralized system is quite suitable. Most of the routes in the United States are widely spread and mostly involve large-volume freight transport, so it is necessary to adopt the sectionalized system. Most of our country's major routes span two or three provinces in length. In terms of topography, the sectionalized system is more suitable. However, the transportation of various roads is far less heavy than that of European and American railways. Therefore, the organizational system should be simple and economical. Due to the lack of talent, the centralized system can concentrate the operation affairs of the entire road in the hands of a relatively small number of people. Therefore, within the possible scope, the centralized system should be adopted.</p>
<p>(2) Dedicated Telephone: The operation of the train dispatching system should be equipped with a complete dedicated telephone as an indispensable tool.</p>
<p>The transmission of information and the issuing of orders require speed. Even a slight delay can negate its effectiveness. Railways in Sweden, Norway, Belgium, Spain, and France are mostly equipped with selective telephones. The plan for the installation of dedicated telephones on the Pinghan Railway is appended later for reference.</p>
<p>(3) Vehicle Allocation: Vehicle allocation is either handled concurrently by the dispatching office, such as on the London Midland Railway, or handled by a separate organization, such as on the London and North Eastern Railway. However, the Midland Railway alone has more than 128,000 freight cars, with no less than a hundred types. In our country, the total number of freight cars on all railways combined is only over 17,000. The largest number of freight cars on major roads is no more than three or four thousand. The disparity in the complexity of affairs is more than several dozen times. Therefore, it is believed that the dispatching office can competently handle vehicle allocation matters concurrently.</p>
<p>(4) Dispatching of Locomotives and Train Crews: Since the train guards belong to the car service personnel, they should be under the management of the car service. As for the rotation and dispatch of other workers such as drivers and firemen, as well as the allocation and command of locomotives, they are either under the management of the car service or the locomotive service. The railways of various countries differ due to different organizations. However, since these affairs are considerably related to train dispatching, they should be managed concurrently by one leader, which will easily achieve effectiveness. The future trend of railways in various countries will inevitably lean towards this type of organization. Although this differs from the current system of dividing the duties of the car and locomotive departments in our country's railways, we should judge whether it is sound in principle and appropriate in practice. Therefore, this plan holds this view on locomotive service matters, in order to show the intention of striving for reform and not being bound by the current system.</p>
<p>Finally, the author has one more thing to say. Professor E.R. Sherrngton of Transportation Studies at the University of London once revealed the essence of the train dispatching system, saying, "This system lies in concentrating the dispatch of trains in the hands of a relatively small number of personnel with high-level training and high salaries, and also enabling them to have a clear understanding of the entire line of transportation under their jurisdiction." Therefore, even with good laws and good intentions, it is especially important to have personnel who can implement them and be good at using them. Zhuangzi said that the medicine for preventing chapped hands is the same, but some use it to dominate, while others cannot avoid making a living by washing silk floss generation after generation. This depends on the self-improvement of all those in the national railway industry. The creation of this humble plan is of negligible benefit. (The End)</p>

<p>Ningbo Yongyao Electric Light Company's New Machinery Arrives in Yong: Ningbo Yongyao Electric Light Company announced that the original machinery of the company was insufficient for use, so it built a new factory and ordered a new high-pressure double-cylinder 2,000-kilowatt turbine generator from Shanghai Xintong Company last year, along with a 300-pound high-pressure boiler and other complete factory equipment. The entire equipment arrived in Shanghai last month. Because the machinery was heavy, Yongyao Company specially sent engineer Zhang Hongqing to Shanghai to supervise the transportation. Yesterday, all the machinery was packaged and loaded onto the Hengshan wheel and transported to Yong. The installation can begin immediately. The double-cylinder turbine is the latest model in the world and has not yet been used in our country. Its coal consumption can be reduced by more than one-third compared with ordinary turbines. As for the speed of starting and the durability of use, it is also not comparable to ordinary ones. Xintong Company has been undertaking power plant projects all over the country for a long time. Recently, in order to seek excellence in engineering, it has strengthened its research on the complete plan of new high-pressure power plants. In addition to Yongyao Company, the new 4,000-kilowatt high-pressure turbine generator added by Yong'an Yarn Factory is also handled by Xintong Company. After the new power plant in Ningbo is completed soon, not only will the city's electricity can be greatly expanded, but also there will be one more opportunity for observation in our country's engineering field.</p>
