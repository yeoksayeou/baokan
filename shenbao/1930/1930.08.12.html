<h3>東省大豆行銷德國情形</h3>
<p>吉林通信東省爲産豆之區亦即惟一大宗之出口惟農作及商運均欠改善漸有下降之勢以致銷售歐陸各地亦多窒滯近經工商部工商訪問民局函據上海德國商會函知近年東省大豆行銷德國情形以與東省對外貿易有關轉抄原件函請吉林省政府查照經即轉飭吉林商聯會研考兹將原件覓錄如次以見我東省大豆在德實具有相當之地位焉</p>
<h3>（一）大豆在德</h3>
<p>純用於各種工業及油坊實業豆油則作食料及工業之需磨碎之大豆今巳視爲喂養牲畜品有最充分蛋白質之食料因咸知以之飼牛能增進牛乳出産之效能大豆粉之用途亦能與其他通用粉麵相抵且以之製造麵包尤能增加滋養之質</p>
<p>（二）大豆油及其他大豆産物在德之需要及銷費正方興未艾大豆油之用途尤以供給滋養品爲甚磨碎大豆今巳視爲食品中最有價值者矣</p>
<p>（三）磨碎大豆尚可以具有油性之種子産物如椰子餅花生餅等替代至於大豆實無他物可以直接替代</p>
<p>（四）按現下消息大豆在德於本年内斷無减落之可能以本年前三個月中進口之數與上年比較巳屬超過至於價格之低落並非由於需要之疲軟實因全世界農産物價格共同之低落此種農産物價格共同之低落自能使德國農民購買力之銳减畜養消費之需要以隨之而减低但當上項價格低落之時德國農民對於大豆之需要仍復向上</p>
<p>（五）今將近五年來大豆進口之數開列如左即知德國對於此項需要之增進</p>
<p>一九二五年三三六○○○噸</p>
<p>一九二六年三七○○三八噸</p>
<p>一九二七年五七六○九六噸</p>
<p>一九二八年八四七七二四噸</p>
<p>一九二九年一○二三八五八噸</p>
<p>一九三○年一月至三月二九一七一五噸</p>
<p>德國由華進口幾兩倍於其對華出口此應注意者一九二九年對華出口之價值爲一萬九千萬金馬克由華進口之價值三萬萬六千五百萬金馬克</p>

<p>週初銀洋巿稍優</p>
<h3>巿塲概况</h3>
<p>金融界業務狀况本屬夏末秋初適值最淡之候爰是每日形勢岑寂逾恒微特洋欵買賣及銷胃之疎滯即銀欵之需給亦無重大消息乃致收解數量日形稀少拆押交易竟有中斷者但昨爲星期一巿氣狀况比較平時略形升色銀行收解亦頗優繁惟洋欵去胃依然呆滯耳</p>
<h3>厘拆價格</h3>
<p>（洋厘）早巿爲七錢二分九厘一毫二忽半午巿爲七錢二分九厘三毫七忽半結果似較前日巿價轉昻三毫七忽半惟去化微細終久無升騰可能或亦在盤旋中未能有所軒輊耳（銀拆）連日銀根鬆濫達於極點每日非二分即白借昨日早巿銀拆雖開二分而午巿亦仍白借劃頭終無行巿銀掛牌更無論矣</p>

<h3>休息</h3>
<p>— 椿森</p>
<p>王實味著</p>
<p>實在這樣一個滿佈着魅魑魍魎的萬惡的社會怎能不使一般年青青的人由痛苦悲哀而失望而絶望呢一切封建的遺物滿滿圍成了鐵絲網圍在週遭擺在眼前的都是鬼蜮與黑暗當没有踏進社會的時候是滿腔熱望然而在踏進了以後一切現實的環境幾不及理想的萬一每天接觸的無非是冷酷殘虐虚僞欺詐的面目和枯燥刻板的工作於是自然而然活跳跳熱血洶湧的消沉了神經思想不由麻痺遲鈍純潔的心靈射上了創傷的羽箭畢竟不能再煎熬着……煎熬着……了而在生之路上疲倦以至厭棄了</p>
<p>固然這其間的責難青年不能堅持到底而惶慄於茫然的前途和不能容受社會的現實環境奮鬭而加以澈底改造是不能辭的但另一方面講這樣的社會制度也只有使純潔的青青年到處碰壁而且因爲青年清白純潔之身往往不願與濁流迎合同伍沾汚自巳的人格在這樣懸殊的狀况之下能給一個才離開學校生活踏入真的社會的自負甚厚的青年美好的結果嗎一幕幕的黑暗只使自己厭惡同時也何嘗不想到自巳該怎樣怎樣奈環境會允許的嗎奮鬭不得掙扎掙扎不得還能如何呢雖則誰都說青年是富於向上意志的那裏知道惟其如此苦悶更深呵在工作上求光明是的然而苟没頭没腦的工作那戮傷該怎樣的打擊我們可以說「這地獄的社會一日不毁滅人類的痛苦一日不得解脫合理的美的社會一日没有建設成功人類的幸福一日不能獲得」這話自然不免太遠了然而也正是顯出時代青年所處地位的惡劣因之我們要求青年充分表現向上進取的意志自也不能不創造新的美好的社會使青年得以發展個性無形中發生鼓勵的力量所以要是嚴格一點爲我們青年表白一句這大半都是社會給予的影響</p>
<p>這本「休息」便是從社會的實際生活所體騐過來的呌喊是惡社會的暴露是敵不過種種的壓迫憤激悲哀失望痛苦……以致不得不抛棄了一切往那幽靜的清波休息去作者是這樣呼喊「我底死並不是自殺我只是要到那澄明靜冷的清波裏休息休我疲乏了的精神調劑調劑我枯涸了的血液潤舒潤舒我燒焦了的靈魂—待我恢復了原有的力時再和這妖魔社會搏戰我是不會死去的喲」（八五頁）這休息這疲倦於生之象徵的休息呵能不掀感共鳴而流深切的同情之涙呢我們看吧一個極端反對自殺認識自巳「自負是覺悟青年中的一個更不願以死解脫個人輕易放棄自巳底使命」（四八頁的青年竟「想起一年前的我還是個壯健活潑的青年不知爲什麽一年後的今日我便不得不投白投白死神的懷裏」（八四頁）他是這樣沉痛「母親的死固然是我生命裏一道深重的創傷但吮吸我的血液斵盡我底精力的實在是這血腥肉臭的社會呵牠使我失學使我做不願做的煩重機械的工作使我熱血騰沸使我癲狂使我患不可救治的病最後牠逼我去死」（八五頁）哦這是誰的不幸誰的賜予</p>
<p>這裏是包含十一封信當一口氣讀完了心頭不禁激起火來我被烈焰般的情感打動了呵這社會竟犧牲了這樣一個青年不其實有更多的青年同樣被犧牲了吧</p>
<p>他是「…悔恨當初不該讀書作一個無知無識的農夫數畝薄田自耕自食朝暮承歡於老母飽享自然風景與天倫樂趣是多展優遊自在不止學旣不耗費又可在農作上從事生産家中也不像現在債台高築」因此不得巳而結束了學校生活的十八歲的青年懷着鬼胎走上這黑暗齷齪的社會路來了當一個郵局的局員他雖然「感到微妙的痛苦因爲這地方在我底眼中巳現出了惡魔的暗影在向我作微笑」但也「曾感到一種未有過的愉快因爲想到這是第一天用自巳的力量換來飯吃」（七頁）他希望能半讀半工不料不上半月所謂計劃成了鏡花水月反體會到那一言難盡的滋味了「我巳從一個生龍活虎般的青年一變而爲機械的奴隷了只就工作時間來說從早七時到夜十時差不多没半點閑暇甚至計吃飯都無空而且每飯都是生吞硬嚥填下肚裏丢下碗箸便即刻又要繼續這不死的工作」（九頁）更受同事的挪揄爲的是新來的處處蒙白眼與輕侮的惡意工作却比任何那一個同事都要煩重</p>
<p>終於因機器運用得太劇了吐了一大口鮮紅的血害了九死一生的病年青青的精力消失了然而他是依舊奮鬥着的鼓起勇氣在進攻「只要努力多少可以得代價的」因爲—</p>
<p>「我們青年的使命就是要用我們的力去搗毁一切爲淵窟用我們的血去澆减一切的魔火拯救阽危的祖國改造齷齪的社會乃是我們應有的惟一目標與責任」（四七頁）不幸慈母長逝了這給他的創傷是「母親與我實在是相依爲命她是我精神深處的撫慰者是我生命的光明是我靈魂的寄托失掉了這樣一個真真當得起母親的母親我底一切勇氣希望熱情豪志都氷消了」（六一頁）可不是嗎</p>
<p>同時又嘗「至視骨肉毫無人情」的剌激他的叔父當他剛經了喪母與重病兩重創傷日在悲哀之　裏浸沉着便惡毒地逼逍歸母喪時借的錢給他達到併吞家的目的並且發現了自巳的病巳至不能醫治的地步他於是排脫了一切决定了他的計劃了他告訴我們</p>
<p>「我是極端反對自命覺悟的青年自殺的失戀的自殺雖然它本身有她的意義但巳是我們處這種時代的中國青年所應避免而視爲不當的了至於悲憤社會萬惡國家糜爛而自殺如果不是由於驟然的瘋狂理智尚未消失那簡直是懦弱和不澈底更應當爲我們所不取了因爲我認定真欲救國真欲改造社會便應當用我們的精力和血液去切實做點工作換點代價——可是我現在巳經是精力疲竭血液枯涸的人了我是真真精力和血液都没有了都没有了</p>
<p>呵真是「我們現在正是思想奔放狂熱尋求真美善的青年期不幸生在這時代這社會接觸的處處是黑暗是汚濁是罪惡怎不剌傷我們純潔的心靈使我們感到悲憤與失望」至於對於這幕悲劇我們所要尊敬的是他的和社會的實生活肉搏過來的呼聲雖然也不免有的地方是自餒了但見他那堅苦卓絶大無畏的精神不是處處都流露着嗎呵我們十八歲的青年戰士給社會奪去了這是我們青年的生機嗎</p>
<p>感慨不禁湧溢總之這本書雖是近於悲觀傷感而我們却能發見多少我們社會的内幕呵</p>

        <h1>1930.08.12</h1>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>The Central Executive Committee, regarding Wang Jingwei and others betraying the Party and the nation by raising troops and creating chaos, issued a proclamation to the people on the 11th, saying that the only path to survival for the Chinese nation lies in following the three stages of military government, tutelage government, and constitutional government as determined by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, to realize the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, after the completion of the Northern Expedition, our Party established the policy of unification and peace, hoping to conclude the work of the military period and initiate all construction projects of the tutelage government period to lay the foundation for the constitutional government period. For the past two years, the Central Government, comrades of the entire Party, and the people of the whole country have been encouraging each other, hoping to, with the spirit of enduring hardship and striving for revenge, seek the restoration of the nation's strength from the chaos of the past ten years, and the recovery of society's vitality and the development of the people's livelihood. At the same time, we also wanted to use this gradually restored and developed national strength to implement various construction projects to open up a new path for the life of the Chinese nation. Unexpectedly, the Guangxi clique and the Feng Yuxiang faction of warlords repeatedly rebelled during these two years, not only disregarding Party discipline and national laws, but also directly antagonizing the people of the whole country who unanimously longed for unification and peace. The Central Government repeatedly convened national demobilization conferences last year, hoping to guide them onto the right path. However, before the ink was dry, their rebellious plot was revealed. These people consistently regarded the Central Government's usual sincerity, trustworthiness, and leniency as weakness, and their past repeated failures as accidental. They raised troops to harm the country and did not repent. When their desperate situation became apparent, Yan Xishan could turn hatred into friendship with Feng Yuxiang, and Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi could recognize traitors as their fathers. The deep collusion between the remaining warlords in the north and south, mutually supporting each other, led to this rebellion and plunged our people into dire straits. The Central Government has been enduring pain to quell the rebellion for several months. The soldiers at the front clearly know that unless these warlords are eliminated, there is no way to guarantee the lives and property of the people of the whole country, as well as the political, economic, and social construction plans on which prosperity and development depend. Therefore, they would rather sacrifice their lives and brave the summer heat to kill the bandits without hesitation. Since the dispatch of troops, the Zhang Fakui, Li Zongren, Huang Shaohong, and Bai Chongxi rebels in the south have been wiped out, and their remnants have been trapped in Guilin. In the north, the main force of the Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan rebel armies has been defeated, and they are bravely advancing along the Pinghan, Longhai, and Jiaoji railway lines. The rebels' demise can be expected soon. However, at this time when the rebels are exhausted, Wang Jingwei, who has lost his integrity, is trying to confuse the people by means of his so-called expanded conference. Wang Jingwei is attempting to rely on the secret techniques he learned from the Communist Party over the years, to steal the name of our Party and use the pseudo-expanded conference as a resource to advance a united front of all counter-revolutionary forces. The expanded conference is not found in the Party's constitution, and in fact, all those who participated in the pseudo-expanded conference are warlords and politicians deeply hated by the whole country. Observing the counter-revolutionary elements participating in it, they can be roughly divided into five factions: first, the Feng Yuxiang faction; second, the Yan Xishan faction; third, the Guangxi clique; fourth, the Western Hills Conference faction; and fifth, the Reorganization faction. Although some members of each faction have served as members of the Central Executive or Supervisory Committees for one or two terms, their qualifications have either been lost due to the expiration of their terms or they have been expelled for betraying the Central Government. Yet, they shamelessly claim to be members of our Party, which is the height of absurdity. This kind of counter-revolutionary gathering that harbors filth and accepts dirt was initially used by Yan Xishan as a tool for his personal planning. Now, Wang Jingwei wants to hijack it again as a tool for playing tricks. What Wang Jingwei relies on are the politicians of the Reorganization faction, and the Reorganization faction is a disguised form of the Communist Party. Regardless of how the words and actions of these people change on the surface, their central strategy never deviates from the conspiracy instructed by Soviet Russian imperialism, which is to participate in any turmoil, destroy any social organization, and instigate a communist revolution in uninterrupted turmoil. Wang Jingwei's plan is that by participating in the rebellion of Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang at this time, on the one hand, he can prolong the war, and on the other hand, he can take the opportunity in the prolongation of the war to seize the power of the first group of allies and replace them by attaching himself to the second group of allies. When his opportunity comes again, he can then seize the power of the second group of allies and replace them by attaching himself to the third group of allies. In this way, they will always be participating in turmoil and always playing counter-revolutionary conspiracies in the turmoil, hoping to increase their own power. However, if Wang Jingwei wants to carry out this kind of plan, he must use his flattering and bewitching tricks during this rebellion of Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang to deceive and obtain a great mixture of all counter-revolutionary elements, so that he can then start to use his skills of manipulation. Therefore, Wang Jingwei first mixed the Reorganization faction and the Western Hills Conference faction, who were incompatible with each other, as the first smokescreen, then shamelessly used the connection of the remaining warlords who hated each other as the second smokescreen, and then used the collusion of the communist bandits in Hunan and Jiangxi as the third smokescreen. Each layer of the smokescreen contains various incompatible factions, and he is slowly plotting to defeat them one by one with all kinds of seductive and provocative strategies. All of this is the strategy of the Soviet Russian Communist Party using a united front, and Wang Jingwei is doing his best to use it. When Wang Jingwei arrived in Pingxiang in Hunan, there was the tragedy of the communist bandits in Changsha. In Jiangxi, there was the activity of the communist bandits in Zhangshu, Fengcheng, and other places. The people of Hunan and Jiangxi all saw that these people did not have slogans to overthrow Wang Jingwei and Feng Yuxiang. It is self-evident who masterminded the disasters and massacres suffered by the people of Hunan and Jiangxi this time. Furthermore, the Central Government's generals who attacked Guangxi seized a secret telegram that Wang Jingwei sent to Li Zongren on July 31. Wang Jingwei, because Zhang Fakui's troops had been defeated, assigned him the task of uniting with the communist bandits in Hunan and Jiangxi, and agreed with the communist bandits to attack Wuhan in different directions on August 10. When Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and He Long attacked Zhangshu and Changsha, Wang Jingwei telegraphed Li Zongren to lead his troops to Hunan to provide backup, but he did not know that the remnants of Li Zongren's troops had been besieged in Guilin. Moreover, the confession obtained by He Yingqin from the captured communist bandits also proved that Wang Jingwei was actually mixing with the warlords on the surface, but secretly colluding with the communist bandits. Reviewing the course of this warlord rebellion, Yan Xishan was the first to initiate the rebellion in the north, and the result was the emergence of Feng Yuxiang, who has always relied on Soviet Russia as his backing. The remnants of the Guangxi clique were the leaders of the rebellion in the south, and the result was the emergence of Wang Jingwei, who has always been affiliated with the Communist Party. Therefore, the result of the rebellion of the warlords of the Shanxi and Guangxi cliques is only to create opportunities for the Communist Party and Soviet Russian imperialism. The warlords themselves will soon fall into the trap of the Communist Party without waiting for the addition of national law. It can be asserted that the Central Government was heartbroken that it could not rescue the people of Changsha in advance during the communist disaster and burning. It is unknown what hatred Wang Jingwei and others have against the people of Hunan that they must be put to death. It is heard that the rebel party still thinks that the disaster in Changsha is not enough and is planning to inflict on the people of other provinces what they inflicted on the people of Hunan. The people of the whole country should think about whether this poverty-stricken and exhausted China can tolerate warlords, politicians, the Communist Party, and imperialism devouring each other wildly and draining the pond to catch fish, or whether they will rise up together to extinguish the evil forces of counter-revolutionary factions who are heavily involved. At this time, when the conspiracies of the counter-revolutionary factions are overlapping, the Party, remembering the difficulty of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and countless martyrs in starting the revolution, vows to quell the rebellion and exterminate the communist bandits, and to work with the people to complete the mission of building a nation based on the Three Principles of the People on the road to peace and unification. If the people of the whole country want to listen to the sweet words and temptations of the counter-revolutionary elements gathered in Peiping, then communist disasters will repeatedly arise and the nation may perish. Otherwise, they should strictly distinguish between right and wrong, and the situation of order and chaos, and not give the bandits an opportunity to riot due to impatience, and not listen to rumors and fall into the trap of the reactionary politicians' provocations. In this way, the momentum of the rebellion will be exhausted, the greatest conspiracy of red imperialism will not be able to succeed, and the war of suppressing the rebellion that the whole country has been enduring for months will also be successfully completed.

<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>Military News (1) It is confirmed that our left and right flank units on the Jinpu Railway have separately reached Jieshou and Feicheng. The rear troops are advancing very quickly and have been clearing the remaining enemies in the Fanjia Town area on the right flank of Taian for several consecutive days. The enemy's trenches were completely broken through, with casualties exceeding tens of thousands. A part of the enemy has already collapsed towards Jinan and is in extreme disarray. The Han army left a part to take charge of searching and destroying the remaining troops in the Taian right flank area. (2) The Han army is advancing along Taian. The enemy retreated in haste and completely abandoned the artillery regiment. They have attacked more than 20 miles past Taian and are still advancing fiercely. (3) Chiang Kai-shek, due to the great victory in the Jinpu military operations, specifically telegraphed the Jinpu generals for their respective commendations and ordered them to recover Jinan within one week and eliminate the enemy south of the Yellow River.

The trapped enemy in Taian and Feicheng can be disarmed. The vanguard troops have arrived at Jieshou. Because the enemy suffered a loss on the Jiaoji Railway, both sides are in a tense situation, and there is no determination to hold on. Jinan is not a problem. What is worrying is that the destruction of bridges and tracks is too ruthless. The two bridges at Jieshou and the Yellow River will inevitably be destroyed.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Turkish-Persian Dispute</h3>
<p>Turkey and Persia both struggled after the European War to break free from the restraints of strong countries and become revitalized nations. They are also the most effective countries in the Eastern national movement, and they are both independent, but their situations are still extremely difficult. Both countries find it difficult to deal with strong neighbors and to reorganize their internal affairs. Therefore, it is imperative for both Turkey and Persia to unite with each other to help each other in their diplomacy, rather than to be suspicious of each other and start a conflict themselves.</p>
<p>The revival of Turkey and Persia was successful thanks to Kemal Atatürk and Reza Shah, respectively. Both were strong and capable men who were determined to make progress, similar to Mussolini of Italy. Therefore, the internal affairs of both countries today are focused on making every effort to develop, and their diplomacy is often unwilling to show weakness. However, the changes in the environment are unpredictable, and those who are too eager to make progress are prone to setbacks. For example, recently, the Kurdish movement's conspiracy for independence has been discovered within Turkey, and major changes have occurred in the political situation. Persia has had a major earthquake in Salmas, and the people are all feeling uneasy. Is this not what is meant by unpredictability? Moreover, a major dispute has suddenly arisen between Turkey and Persia. The Turkish government first felt indignant because the incursion and rebellion of the Kurdish rebels was due to Persia's secret assistance. Now, it feels even more unhappy because the Persian government has rejected its request to demarcate the border. If the Turkish government does carry out a military expedition to punish the Kurdish rebels, the involvement of the Turkish-Persian relations may fall into a more dangerous situation. It is fortunate that those who are in the same difficult situation are not getting along well and rejoicing in the misfortune of others will surely take the opportunity to wait behind them. Are they not aware of this?</p>
<p>Important Domestic Telegrams Two</p>
<p>The Japanese Consul in Changsha Arrives in Hankou to Report on the Recent Situation in Changsha</p>
<h3>Hankou</h3>
<p>The Japanese Consul in Changsha, Tanimoto, arrived here this morning on the Xiangjiang Maru and immediately visited Consul General Sakane to report on the situation of the Changsha incident. The content is roughly as follows: the residences of the Japanese expatriates in the Lingguandu area have almost all been destroyed. It is said that the looting in this area was the most extreme. Only a few pillars of the houses remain. The doors, windows, curtains, and glass were all taken away. The Shuiluzhou area was spared this disaster. The Japanese consulate was completely burned except for the office. All public documents were taken out and preserved without incident. The communist bandits are now 50 miles outside the city. The order in Changsha has not been completely restored. When He Jian's army recaptured Changsha, I immediately went to meet with He, who first expressed his regrets. According to his conversation, 90 of the 100 guards went to the front line, and He only had 10 guards to escape. After He entered the city, he still had no residence. The Chinese institutions and the silver shops and money houses near the Bajiating in the city were all looted. Therefore, the communist army must have taken out a considerable amount of gold. The city is now under strict guard, and those who have not been permitted are not allowed to walk even during the day. Each household is searched in order, and 300 to 400 suspected persons are arrested every day. The extent of the damage suffered by the Japanese expatriates is inconvenient to mention.

<p>Wang Boqun Discusses Rear Area Security</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>Minister of Communications Wang Boqun stated that the communist disaster in Changsha is just one scene of the Communist Party's plan, and there are many other hidden dangers. Recently, the arrest of communists by the Capital Telegraph Bureau and the labor unrest in Shanghai were mostly planned by the Communist Party. At present, all reactionary factions have jointly launched attacks on our Party. While military affairs at the front are very important, the work of preventing communism in the rear is even more important. Those who are directly responsible for political affairs must strive to build and eliminate corruption, so that reactionary factions have no excuse. However, Party workers should always guide the masses to stand on the same ground as the government. When Chairman Chiang is busy with military affairs at the front, comrades in the rear should take a calm attitude, distinguish right from wrong, and avoid being reckless, otherwise it is tantamount to helping the warlords at the front. These words are worth everyone's attention. If the Party, government, military, and people are of one mind, it will not be difficult to stabilize the rear. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<h3>Political Situation in Turkey is About to Change</h3>
<p>Ambassador to France Returns Home to Form a New Party</p>
<p>The Current Cabinet May Be Facing Instability</p>
<p>The Kurdish Rebels Constantly Invade the Border</p>
<p>Persia's Reply Refuses Border Demarcation</p>
<h3>Reuter, Constantinople, 10th</h3>
<p>It seems that a significant change is about to occur in the Turkish political situation. Ali Fethi has resigned as the Ambassador to France and is currently on leave to organize a new political party. The main aim is to resolve Turkey's current economic and financial difficulties. Three hundred and fifteen members of the Angora Parliament, who were affiliated with the People's Party, will now be divided into two parties, and the position of Prime Minister General Ismet may be shaken. It is particularly noteworthy that there have been many rumors recently that Ismet has lost the trust of President Kemal. Fethi is a close friend of President Kemal. Today, the President told people that he welcomes the emergence of the new political party, saying that the confrontation between the two parties will definitely consolidate domestic republicanism and greatly contribute to the development of the national political and social structure. At the same time, disturbing news is coming from the southeastern border of Turkey. Turkey recently sent a note to the Persian government requesting the demarcation of the Turkish-Persian border to prevent frequent disturbances by the Kurdish tribes. Persia's reply has now been received, but the contents have not been announced. Yesterday, it was heard that the wording of the reply was tantamount to refusing the request for border demarcation. In any case, the Turkish government will eventually have to send troops to suppress the Kurds. The Chief of Staff has set off to inspect the troops in the eastern provinces.</p>
<p>Germany Celebrates Three Major Anniversaries</p>
<p>Recovering Lost Territory</p>
<p>Breaking Free from Economic Shackles</p>
<p>The People Cheer Ecstatically</p>
<h3>National Society, Berlin, 10th</h3>
<p>The German people have temporarily put aside their political and economic worries and are celebrating three major anniversaries with great joy. This time coincides with the 40th anniversary of Germany's exchange of the Changjiebo area with Britain for the North Sea's Xili Helgeland Island, the 10th anniversary of the East Prussian National Assembly's resolution to remain affiliated with Germany, and, more importantly, the 11th anniversary of the enactment of the Republican Constitution. According to the Harmful Acts Commemoration Day, which was originally on Monday, this year, because the Rhine has regained its freedom and national sovereignty throughout the territory except for the Saar region, celebrations begin today. Various ceremonies in the capital are particularly grand, with six thousand schoolchildren gathering in the National Assembly Square to perform the liberation of the Rhine. It is estimated that no fewer than seventy thousand people watched, making it the most grand event in the capital today.

<p>Dr. Torleif Randers, the former chief official of the occupied territories, spoke frankly about the issue of Germany's eastern border during the parade celebrating the 10th anniversary of the East Prussian Citizen's Assembly (in which ninety percent of the East Prussian people expressed their willingness to remain under the German flag forever). He said that the division of the land east of the Vistula River into Polish territory was a heavy blow to Germany's eastern wing. Poland's future can only be guaranteed if Germany and Poland are no longer in a state of constant unrest due to unfair borders. He also said that we cannot help but feel resentment when we see the land that was once ours but is now lost, but there will eventually be a day when we recover it. A war for justice will eventually break out to liberate Germany and Europe. After Dr. Randers made this statement, discussions or diplomatic events may arise between Germany and Poland.</p>
<p>American Forest Fire Destroys Nearby Farmhouses</p>
<h3>Associated Press, Ribeeten, 10th</h3>
<p>While President Hoover was convening the Secretary of Agriculture and other relevant administrative officials in his office today to discuss disaster relief measures, a forest fire suddenly broke out seven miles away. Firefighters from all over gathered to put out the fire, and Navy personnel also joined in. It is expected that the fire can be brought under control in the evening.</p>
<h3>Associated Press, Tacoma, 10th</h3>
<p>A fire broke out in a 25-mile-wide forest in the Carville district, and farmhouses were destroyed everywhere. What is strange is that after the fire warden of the district was notified, no one was sent out by the fire department. The government is investigating the reason.</p>
<p>The Committee to Investigate the Japan-U.S. Treaty is Established</p>
<p>The Chairman Decides on Ito</p>
<p>The Response Text Raises Questions</p>
<p>The Ruling and Opposition Parties Have Different Opinions</p>
<p>Inukai Tsuyoshi Criticizes the Government</p>
<p>Saying It Starts Like a Crafty Rabbit and Ends Like a Virgin</p>
<h3>Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 11th</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of requesting a response text as prompted, the opinions of both the ruling and opposition parties are as follows: The Minseito Party said that the Privy Council's request for the government to provide a response text from the Council of Councillors was rejected, and the proposal to open an investigation committee to make this an issue is intended to delay deliberation while this investigation committee has not yet been decided. Although this is not the intention of all the advisors, if the attitude of showing malice continues, they will fight heroically with the backing of 270 members of parliament, preferring to be shattered like jade rather than preserved like tile. The Seiyukai Party said that it is extremely inappropriate not to inform experts of their opinions when deliberating on important treaties concerning national defense. In the deliberation of the Washington Treaty, the response text of the Marshal's Office had been submitted to the Privy Council first. Even if the content of the response text is unfavorable, reporting it verbatim is what is valued as the national defense of the state. As a result, the government has no choice but to submit to the Privy Council; if it is concealed, it would be cowardly and incompetent.</p>
<h3>Electric Communication, Tokyo, 11th</h3>
<p>Inukai, the president of the Seiyukai Party, went to his Fujimi Villa in Nagano Prefecture yesterday morning to attack the government's inaction and lack of policies. He said that the Seiyukai's economic investigation team can return to Tokyo in four or five days to report on the truth of the recession. Hamaguchi, Inoue, etc., say that the recession is not as severe as the world says, or that the recession is gradually recovering, which is purely deceiving children. They turn a deaf ear to the suffering of the people. The government's promotion of disarmament can be achieved through the London Treaty, saying that it has gained the support of public opinion, but from the point of view of expenses, it is only known that the result is military expansion and then wants to use false means to try to cover it up, so the situation is even more difficult. The Privy Council's request to present the response text and the refusal to give reasons proves that the content is unfavorable to the government. Hamaguchi's will is extremely soft and he is instructed by Eguchi and others, so he adopts the attitude of 各斯. However, if the investigation committee decides that it must be submitted, the Privy Council will have to submit. As for Hamaguchi, he may not have intended to lie at first, but the reports he received were not true, so his words were unfounded. It is cruel to Hamaguchi personally, and the people are even more confused. As for the budget formulation, there is not a single true action. At first, they spoke out and said that the surplus from military reduction would be used to reduce the burden on the people, but from the perspective of military strength, although it is military reduction, after despising the opinions of the military command, they then apologized and said that they would find a way to raise funds for the supplementary plan, regardless of the amount. It starts like a crafty rabbit and ends like a virgin, that's what they mean. And Adachi really has an unyielding spirit, saying that unemployment etc. are not a problem and that no one has starved to death. His brain is truly frightening. Suicides due to unemployment are reported every day. How can he not know? Isn't he a strange Minister of the Interior?</p>

<p>Various Provinces Submit New Demands for Japan's Next Year's Budget</p>
<p>Violating the Austerity Policy</p>
<p>Many Future Disputes</p>
<h3>Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 11th</h3>
<p>The budget of each province for the sixth year will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance by the 15th. Although each province is afraid that it will be difficult to collect as scheduled, the new requirements violate the Ministry of Finance's policy in unexpected ways. For example, the Ministry of Interior requires 20 million yuan in the name of water conservancy projects, port construction fees, and unemployment relief projects. The Ministry of Navy requires 30 million yuan in the name of air force expansion and subsidy for the maintenance of naval vessels (which is a planned plan). The Ministry of Communications intends to request an increase of 15 million yuan for pensions in addition to the construction of an international airfield in Fukuoka and the completion of night aviation lighting equipment. That is, excluding the supplementary plan of the Ministry of Navy, the total amount of new requirements reaches 100 million yuan. Even if Minister of Finance Inoue deletes all these requirements, he still has to raise more than 100 million yuan in financial resources. In addition, there is a risk of a decrease in income. From September, the Ministry of Finance and the provinces will inevitably have disputes.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<p>Memorial Week for the Central Government and the National Government</p>
<h3>Central Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>At 9 a.m. on the 11th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 72nd Memorial Week for the Premier in the auditorium. Central Committee members Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Enke Batu, Miao Peicheng, etc., as well as staff from various departments and guests, numbered about 500 people. Chairman Chen Guofu bowed, and then the chairman's report briefly stated: "Regarding the military aspect, the Central Army has captured Tai'an and is surrounding Jinan. Although the Feng rebel troops on the Longhai Line have repeatedly tried their best to counterattack, they have all been defeated. In the recent period, the anti-rebellion military can definitely achieve a great victory and eliminate the rebel troops. There is a definite grasp. After the recapture of Changsha, the tragic suffering of the people was unprecedented. Personnel have now been sent to investigate the details in order to properly appease them. The reason why the Communist Party is so rampant this time is that most of the Central Army was sent to the front to suppress the rebellion. One part of He Jian's troops was stationed in southern Hunan and could not be transferred in time. The defenses of Changsha were inevitably empty, so it was suddenly captured. The most important reason is that the Yan-Feng warlords and reorganizationists saw that the military affairs of the central government were progressing step by step and their own destiny was in danger, so they tried their best to collude with the Communist Party to disrupt our army's rear and attempt to contain a part of the military force, thus causing the tragedy of Changsha. During this period, they still loudly proclaimed anti-communism and prominently unveiled the slogan of exterminating the Communist Party in order to cover up their heinous crimes, deceiving themselves and others, who would believe it. Now, the main forces of Yan and Feng have been defeated and disintegrated. In the present, as soon as the suppression of the rebellion is completed, moving troops to destroy the communists will definitely be like crushing dry weeds and destroying decaying matter. It is not difficult to eliminate them in one fell swoop. After Wang Jingwei arrived in Beiping, the so-called expanded meeting is being greatly publicized. Generally, people believe that it will have some impact on the central government. The reactionaries are especially elated, but the loyal comrades and people of our party who have common sense all regard it as a ridiculous move, no different from seeking their own destruction. In terms of the cause and effect of things, anyone who wants to be the leader of a party must be able to lead the comrades within the party and all the people to follow the doctrine and create happiness for the country and the people, use the credit earned to gain the belief of the people, and must be determined in his integrity and not be swayed by wealth or subdued by force. Only in this way can he bear the heavy expectations of a party and gain sympathy and support. If he flatters the warlords and seeks to achieve personal desires, and is willing to be used by the traitors, then his personality has long been lost. Can he still claim to be the leader? The newspaper reported the other day that Wang had a letter to Qi Xieyuan, actually calling him Comrade Fuwan. Even a three-foot-tall child knows that Qi is a reactionary warlord, but he actually cited him as a fellow traveler, which is not surprising. Also, looking at the newspaper report on his plan to organize a government, he first wants to establish a Supervisory Yuan and an Examination Yuan, and how to organize other high-level agencies is silent and absurd, bizarre and incomprehensible, making people feel at a loss. It is appropriate to see that his days are numbered, his mind is exhausted and his skills are exhausted. After the report was over, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>National Government</h3>
<p>At 10 a.m. on the same morning, the National Government held the Premier's Memorial Week. Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Ma Fuxiang, Yi Peiji, Jiang Menglin, Wang Boqun, Zhang Nanxian, Liu Ruiheng, Lin Xiang, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Zheng Hongnian, Mu Xiangchuan, Zhou Yawei, Wu Siyu, Qin Hua, Chen Yu, etc., and more than 200 officials from the civil and military affairs offices attended. After Chairman Tan Yankai bowed, Secretary Qian Changzhao gave the following political report: "The Jinpu Road in Jinan can be recovered within days. The rebels on the Longhai Road believe that our full force is concentrated on Jinpu and that the attempt to counterattack will cause great losses. Xuchang on the Pinghan Road is under siege and can be captured soon. Roughly, the military affairs can be concluded within a month. As for the area of Changsha, after the communist harassment, it will take some time to restore its vitality in the future. The government is very concerned about this and feels very distressed. The harm of the Communist Party has been going on for more than a day or two. Murders and arson have occurred from time to time in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. The government should have launched a large-scale encirclement and suppression to solve the problem once and for all. However, military rebellions have occurred repeatedly in recent years, and the government has had no choice but to use force. Although it has been gradually pacified, the communists everywhere have been able to survive. Now it is even more rampant than before and cannot be solved immediately. The State Council resolved last Friday that He Yingqin, the director of the Bandit Suppression Affairs of the E, Xiang and Gan Dynasties, was specially appointed to be responsible for handling the bandit suppression affairs. The garrisons of each province are all under the command of the director. At this moment, we think about the rebellion of feudal warlords, the harassment of the Communist Party, and the disturbances of local bandits, and all the final struggles of reactionary elements have created a phenomenon of unrest in the locality. The strength of the government can definitely eliminate them, but we must know that in addition to the general unrest in the country, there are really many social ills. For example, the general poverty, the general weakness, the general backwardness of knowledge, the general decline of righteousness, and the general lack of national consciousness are all equally serious. It is okay to talk about them separately. (1) The general poverty. Although there are no statistics on the property of the people in our country, we refer to local surveys in various aspects. The poor account for at least 70% of the people. The so-called poor, of course, refers to compatriots who cannot maintain or have difficulty maintaining the minimum living standard. Recently, the living standard has become higher and higher, especially after the trend of valuing gold and devaluing silver, it has become more difficult. Even those with a little property can only barely survive, and there are not many people who can be said to be rich in the whole country. At this time of hardship, foreign oppression continues to come, and domestic production cannot immediately make it develop. The danger of the economic future is really unbearable. (2) The general weakness. There is no denying the weakness of our Chinese race. Generally, people have poor health, are plagued by diseases, and plagues occur from time to time. There are not enough Western doctors to distribute in society, and traditional Chinese medicine does not understand science. Western medicines cannot be manufactured themselves and rely entirely on imports. Chinese medicines do not know how to organize, and public health and sports are not emphasized at all. No wonder the race is weakening day by day. According to the speculation of many scholars, the population of our country is only decreasing and not increasing. That is, the mortality rate of all the recent population statistics in various places mostly exceeds the productivity rate. We must know that in the world, the superior races will be defeated, and if we do not try to remedy the situation urgently, we will inevitably gradually disappear. (3) The general backwardness of knowledge. Everyone knows that education in our country is not universal. No matter where you are, there are always too few elementary schools, and it is even more difficult to find a complete elementary school. As for the middle schools and universities, they are not necessarily very good. Therefore, most parents are suspicious of sending their children to school, so the number of people who have the opportunity to go to school is reduced, and the knowledge of the majority of people is also backward. In this 20th century, if you want to live, if you have backward knowledge, even if you can avoid freezing and starving, you will inevitably be exploited. This is a natural result. (4) The general decline of righteousness. There are really too few people in society who can treat people and things with righteousness. The evil and corrupt atmosphere fills the society. A few people with righteousness are sometimes excluded and flow into negativity, and society falls into an incurable state. This situation can lead to the destruction of the country and the extinction of the race. (5) The general lack of national consciousness. The people of our country have always had too strong a personality. The so-called each person sweeps the snow in front of his own door and does not care about the frost on the roof of others. This kind of thinking has almost become a second nature. The general public rarely cares about the future of the country and even considers it noble not to ask about state affairs. Therefore, when they encounter national humiliation, they occasionally show their emotions and soon forget about it. There are so many national humiliation commemoration days in recent years, but the shame has not been erased after all. This cannot but be blamed on our own lack of effort, that is, the lack of national consciousness. The above points are really very serious ills in the current society, and they have a linked relationship. It is definitely not a short time to reverse them, nor can the thoughts and talents of a few people do it. It is necessary for the entire nation to rise up and start a grand reform movement. However, if we look at China, there are indeed not many people who have morality, talent, and a sense of responsibility. Those who have no morality are corrupt, those who are evil are becoming more evil, those who change their minds are changing their minds, and those who fall are falling. We don't need to talk about them. Even those who have morality and talent are often irresponsible, or they sing high-sounding tunes and scold others, or they have a sudden impulse today and a sudden impulse tomorrow, and in the end, they achieve nothing. As for those who have morality and talent and can really take responsibility, because there are too few talents in society, all things are concentrated on one person, and they have to do everything themselves from morning to night. They can only cope with the present and have very little time to think about things in the big, distant, and deep places. In this situation, it is not easy to remedy the current decadent situation. In the future, the government will have to make special efforts, and at the same time, it hopes that all compatriots in the country will have a common awareness to fight to save China."</p>
<h3>何鍵 Recaptures Changsha</h3>
<p>The Tragic Scene of Communist Bandits Slaughtering the People</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: Communist bandit leader Peng Dehuai, claiming to be the commander-in-chief of the 3rd Army Group of the Red Army, gathered over ten thousand communist bandits from Pingxiang and Liuyang. On the evening of the 27th of last month, they captured Changsha, engaging in burning, killing, and looting for ten days. Public and private losses amounted to tens of millions. Half the population has fled. Changsha, once considered the safest place by people from surrounding counties, is no longer a suitable place to live. It is feared that even ten years of recovery will not restore it to its original state. A brief account of the devastation caused by the communist bandits is as follows:</p>
<p>On the night of the 27th, at midnight, the 4th Route Army troops stationed in the city, along with the water and land police and local militia, completely retreated. Officials from various agencies, leaders of various organizations, personnel from the party headquarters, teachers and staff from various schools, and wealthy merchants all fled towards the west gate. All large steamers, whether heading downstream to Hankou or upstream to Xiangtan and Hengzhou, were packed to the brim with no room to stand. Even small private boats were fully hired. The cost of crossing the river was as high as one yuan per person, indicating the dire situation. Before the 4th Route Army had completely retreated, the communist bandit spear teams charged into the city. Initially, they only collected scattered firearms from the army, attacking the headquarters of the 4th Route Army, the provincial government, and various military and police agencies. Around 11 o'clock, the provincial government, the headquarters of the 4th Route Army, the anti-bandit headquarters, the Public Security Bureau, the garrison headquarters, the 15th Division headquarters, and the Changsha County government were all set on fire, burning throughout the night without stopping. On the 28th, they continued to burn civilian property, including the four major public buildings: Education Hall, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, Sun Yat-sen Library, Sun Yat-sen Museum, the Provincial Education Association, the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the County Party Headquarters, police stations in various districts, the Changyue Customs Supervisory Office, the Provincial Bank, the High Court, the District Court, the prison, the municipal preparatory office, the Army Survey Bureau, the Stamp Tax Bureau, the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, and schools such as the Provincial First Normal School. Other buildings were demolished at the request of residents to avoid being affected, including various churches and church buildings inside and outside the city. The residences of important figures such as He Jian, Cao Dianqiu (member of the provincial government), Dai Douyuan (deputy commander of the 16th Division), Liu Yuezhi (secretary of the Provincial Party Committee), and Zhao Heng (president of the Provincial Bank), as well as dozens of private houses including the residence of Chen Peicheng, the general manager of Hunan Electric Light Company, were burned down. All large mansions and residences of important figures were led into by local hooligans and thugs. The Red Army (communist bandits with guns) and the Red Guards (communist bandits without guns wielding spears) broke down doors to search for so-called local tyrants, evil gentry, bureaucrats, military officers, party members, and reactionaries. The life or death of a person was determined by a single word from a passerby or a bystander hooligan. There was no trial or announcement of charges. Sometimes, people were directly sent to the bandit headquarters or the Soviet Provincial government for interrogation. Whenever they entered a people's residence, the Red Army and Red Guards first looted gold jewelry and silver money, and then incited hooligans and thugs to enter and carry away furniture, clothing, and other bulky items, showing favor to the proletariat. Sometimes, they would accuse hooligans and thugs of arbitrary looting and then shoot them, demonstrating their manipulation of the proletariat. On the 29th, Peng Dehuai arrived in Changsha and simultaneously established the so-called Hunan Provincial Soviet, appointing Li Lisan as chairman. He ordered the Changsha Chamber of Commerce to convene merchants from various industries to raise 700,000 yuan in cash within three days to ensure the protection of businesses, otherwise, they would take "free action." At that time, the bandit army was capturing people from various shops and extorting donations. Li Wenyu, Tongfeng, Tongzhen three gold shops, Huafeng, Rixin and other silk shops had already been broken into and looted by the bandit army, each suffering losses of tens of thousands. Only Yu Taihua Gold Shop paid 80,000 yuan in donations and was spared intrusion. Other large businesses had their owners and managers captured, and those identified as local tyrants were arrested. The whole city was filled with fear. The merchants had no choice but to nominate representatives to request that they be allowed to pay the full 700,000 yuan in cash and stop direct action against the merchants. The bandit army then turned to offering rewards: 2,000 yuan for capturing He Jian, Liu Jianshu, Xu Kexiang, Tao Guang, and Wei Suzhong; 1,600 yuan for capturing Cao Bowen, Song Hegeng, and Chen Changzu of the Provincial Committee; 600 yuan for capturing Feng Ti and others of the Party Committee, as well as Changsha County Magistrate Wang Zhengshi, Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Hanchuan, Reformatory Director Zhou Anhan, and Water Police Captain Wang Guangqian. Half the reward would be given for bringing their heads. In addition, anyone who captured a Party Committee member, bureau chief, association president, or regiment commander would be rewarded with 200 yuan. Anyone who concealed information would have their entire family executed. Those who lived together and did not report would also have their entire family executed. As a result, over a thousand so-called local tyrants were arrested one after another and gathered outside Xiaowumen at the 49th Biao and the Bible School, the headquarters of Peng Dehuai. Those who donated several thousand or tens of thousands of yuan could be released, while the rest were arbitrarily executed. When the business community had paid the 700,000 yuan in cash, they were ordered to pay two months' worth of house rent, temporarily based on the assessed value of the houses, within two days. They obtained another 500,000 yuan in cash. No one dared to delay even slightly. Meanwhile, a land policy was promulgated, and a General Anti-Counterfeiting Headquarters and a Confiscation Committee were established, scheduled to begin a house-by-house general inspection and massacre on August 10th. Anyone hiding party members, public officials, military officers, or so-called reactionaries and local tyrants would be executed without mercy. Finding long gowns was considered proof of being a local tyrant's residence. Finding Western suits and school uniforms was considered proof of being a party member or public official's residence, and they would be executed without mercy. It was also planned to select ten men and women from each regiment to serve in the military, and all merchants and workers of various industries were ordered to establish associations and obtain membership certificates before the 8th. Anyone without a membership certificate would be placed under surveillance. Their intention was to communize all industries, merchants, and workers to expand their bandit forces. Therefore, the people of the whole city were terrified. The land and water transportation was sealed off on all sides, making it difficult to escape. Many people were publicly executed by the Red bandits on the street, including Army Hospital Director Liu Fucha, 4th Route Army Staff Officer Su Guangjun, Seal Keeper He Qingyun, County Party Committee member Jiang Xilong, and many others. More than a thousand people were executed outside the 49th Biao and Liuyangmen. The most dangerous thing was that the communist bandits set the price of one Sheng of rice at 200 Wen, one Jin of oil at 800 Wen, and one Jin of salt at 600 Wen. The general public took the opportunity to squeeze and buy. Because of the large number of people and the confusion, some did not pay and freely grabbed what they could. Therefore, within three days, all the rice, oil, and salt stores in the whole city were emptied, resulting in no goods available despite having money. The whole city was on the verge of starvation. People bought ash noodles to stave off hunger, resulting in the 40,000 bags of ash noodles stored in the ash noodle company outside the north gate being snatched away within half a day. The factory buildings were also demolished. Foreign companies also suffered losses, including the Jardine Matheson Company's warehouse and the Japanese Xiaoling Foreign Company. The people of the whole city were in this abyss of misery, unable to escape, and eagerly awaited the arrival of the army. On the morning of the 5th, at 3:00 AM, He Jian personally accompanied Tao Guang, commander of the 31st Division, and led the entire division from the Yiyang Ningxiang line to the west bank of the river to attack Changsha. He ordered Wang Dongyuan's brigade of the 15th Division to advance from Yuezhou Xiangyin to attack the north of Changsha. The three units of Liu Jianshu, commander of the 19th Division, Luo Fanying, commander of the 16th Division, and Chen Guangzhong, commander of the Independent 7th Brigade, concentrated in Tanli and advanced towards the south of Changsha and Liuyang. At the same time, he telegraphed the Hubei army under Luo Lin to assist in the attack on Changsha along the Xiang-E Railway and telegraphed the Jiangxi army under Zhang Huizan to block Pingxiang and Liuyang. Starting at 3:00 AM on the 5th, all troops were mobilized, with the local militias from Changning and Yiyiang counties advancing to the opposite bank of Changsha and feigning an attack on the west gate of the provincial capital. Wang Dongyuan's brigade of the 15th Division and Lei Jun's regiment, in coordination with Chen Wo's brigade of the 31st Division, forcibly crossed the river from Sancha Ji, 15 miles downstream of Changsha, and attacked the north gate and Xiaowumen 49th Biao of Changsha. Yan Zhongru's brigade of the 31st Division crossed the Jinjiang River upstream of Changsha and attacked the south gate of Changsha, Liuyangmen, and the Bible School outside Xiaowumen. Zhou Xiwu's brigade of the 31st Division crossed the Yuelu Mountain and attacked Lingguan Ferry and the south gate. The navy's Xianning and Yongsheng ships also fired their cannons to assist. At the same time, they agreed with Liu Luo and other divisions to attack Yiji湾 and Datuo铺 from both sides. At that time, most of the bandit army tended to heavily defend the Yijiawan Xiangtan line, and there were not many bandit troops in the province. Although they resisted fiercely, they were finally defeated due to the brave encirclement and attack of Tao's division and Wang's brigade. After five hours of stalemate, the bandits' headquarters was broken, more than 2,000 bandits were killed, and more than 1,000 male and female bandits were captured. Bandit Chairman Li Lisan and Bandit Political Department Director Yuan Guoping were killed. Only Peng Dehuai was wounded and broke through the encirclement and fled in a panic towards Huanghua City, Liuyang. After Peng fled, the remaining bandits were successively annihilated. By about 9:00 AM, the whole city was cleared. Only twenty or so people were accidentally injured. Tao Guang personally supervised the division to pursue the bandits. On the 6th, He Jian crossed the river from the spinning factory and returned to the province, temporarily working in the YMCA building. On the 7th, division commanders Liu Jianshu, Luo Fanying, and Wei Suzhong, deputy division commanders Luo Shujia and Dai Douyuan, and Chen Guangzhong and other independent brigade commanders led their troops to the province and ordered their troops to encircle and attack Pingxiang and Liuyang. Provincial government members Zeng Jiwu, Cao Bowen, Cao Dianzhu, and Zhang Kailian, and Secretary-General Yi Shuzhu returned to the province from Xiangxiang, Hengzhou, and Hankou. The departments of the 4th Route Army headquarters and the Anti-Bandit Headquarters moved from Xiangtan to the province and temporarily worked in the YMCA. Wang Dongyuan, brigade commander, was appointed as the garrison commander of the provincial capital. Starting on the 8th, the entire city was cut off from transportation to search for communist bandits hiding and the thugs who aided them, and to search for the public and private property that was looted to clear bandit traces. All follow-up measures and anti-bandit strategies were decided at a joint military-political meeting on the 8th to resolve everything. It is reported that He Jian has made up his mind to destroy Peng's bandit lair to eliminate future troubles and thank the people of Hunan. (August 7th)</p>
<h3>Jinan Suffers Severe Rain Disaster</h3>
<p>Streets and Alleys Become Waterlands</p>
<p>Weather Turns Suddenly Cold</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Jinan and its surrounding areas have experienced a sudden heavy rainfall in recent days. Since the 2nd of this month, it has been raining for five days. Although there have been occasional clearings, it has quickly turned cloudy and rainy again. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the rain was particularly heavy, pouring down like a waterfall. In the afternoon, a strong wind rose again, and the wind and rain mixed together. The weather changed abruptly and turned cold. Many people changed into lined clothing. The streets and roads of the city were a vast expanse of water. In low-lying areas, the water was as deep as two or three feet, and the current was very swift, carrying mud and sand. Therefore, traffic on the streets was cut off. Cars passing through splashed water, resembling boats on a river. Most of the old houses in various places collapsed, and many of the newly built houses also leaked. The areas outside Linxiang Gate, inside the North Gate, at the South City Wall, and at the East City Wall were particularly severely affected. Some residents moved to the city walls to take temporary shelter. The water in the Xiaoqing River between the Dongliushui Rainbow Bridge also rose above the bank by more than two feet. The shops on the main roads, due to their low-lying location, all used burlap sacks filled with soil to place in front of their doors to prevent water from entering. Those who did not prepare in time suffered from the rain, and the water inside the houses was also several feet deep. The rain began to ease slightly at 10:00 PM, and the accumulated water on the roads gradually receded, but the stones were exposed and the roads were rugged and difficult to travel. Unexpectedly, the rain intensified again after 12:00 AM and continued until this morning (6th), and it is still cloudy and rainy. The north wind suddenly rose, and it felt like entering late autumn. Even in lined clothes, it still felt cold. Many young children were already wearing cotton clothes. Such a situation has not been seen in recent years. (August 6th)</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Plot to Disturb Harbin Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Han Shouben Orchestrates from Within</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The local Communist Party planned to carry out disturbances on August 1st, first attacking the headquarters of the 18th Brigade to seize weapons, and then attacking the Special Region Administrative Chief's Office, the Road Police Department, the Public Security Bureau, and the Special Police Management Office. Their plan of attack was to incite the troops of the 18th Brigade and 26th Brigade stationed in the area, and to collude with the 36th Shed Chinese workers of the Eastern Railway. On July 30th, after the Chinese workers of the Eastern Railway were dismissed, the workers still lingered and did not leave the venue.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Someone noticed that the workers were preparing knives, axes, and other weapons, which were sharpened very sharply. They secretly reported to the road police. The road police secretly arrested one or two workers and interrogated them. After confirming the truth, they immediately notified the military and police agencies responsible to strengthen their guard. Therefore, the incident on August 1st did not occur. However, the Special Police Department discovered in recent days that the main figure planning this event was Han Shouben, a former reporter for the Changchun Dadong Daily. Han had served as a special commissioner of the Jilin Central Party Affairs Department during the secret work of the Eastern Province Party Affairs. After the purge of the communists, Han lost his position and worked as a reporter for the Changchun Dadong Daily, secretly promoting communism for the Third International and actively contacting student circles. Last spring, he was discovered by Huo Zhanyi, the president of the Dadong Daily, and was fired from the company. Han went to the Harbin area to engage in activities and was promoted to serve as the secretary of the Eastern Railway Industrial Maintenance Association, provoking labor unrest and promoting communism. After being noticed by the authorities, he voluntarily resigned and returned to Changchun to serve as a teacher at the Seventh Middle School in the Special Region. He was again discovered by the principal for promoting communism at the school and was dismissed. Recently, after the fall of Changsha, the Communist Party in various places was eager to move. Han claimed to be a representative of Song Zheyuan's Northwest Army and publicly engaged in activities. Subsequently, he was discovered by the authorities and arrested by the special police in a inn on Daoli Street on the 5th of this month. That night, he was escorted to Liaoning by one inspector, one translator, and two judicial police officers. However, on the way, near the Laoshaogou Station between Harbin and Changchun, it is unknown what tricks Han used, but he escaped from the car under the strict supervision of the crowd. The police officers who were escorting him returned to Harbin and reported to the authorities. Suspecting that they were selling him out, they have been all arrested and imprisoned. It is generally said that after Han's escape, the communist disaster in the Eastern Province may break out sooner or later. (6th)</p>
<p>Japanese Police's Brutality in Yanbian</p>
<p>Japanese Intend to Invade and Occupy Yanbian</p>
<p>Japanese Police Actually Assault Our Military Officers</p>
<p>Yanbian Circles Blood-Written Declaration</p>
<h3>Harbin Correspondence</h3>
<p>In recent years, Japanese and Korean people have been migrating to the various districts of Jidong Yanbian in increasing numbers, becoming the masters instead of the guests, and making the guest room the master's hall, directly causing the status of the nationals of the sovereign country to be reversed with that of the expatriate residents. It is reported that as of the beginning of May of this year, in the various counties under the jurisdiction of Yanji alone, there were as many as 1.3 million Japanese and Korean expatriates, while the number of Chinese people was very small. Therefore, Japanese and Korean vagrants often take advantage of opportunities to bully the Chinese people. The Japanese government offices in Yanbian have been established everywhere without our permission, and when incidents occur, they stir up trouble to protect them, causing the Chinese people to suffer immensely. There have been numerous cases of Japanese and Korean people killing Chinese people and oppressing our government offices, and official negotiations have been endless and without thorough solutions. Seeing our weakness, the Japanese have increased their bullying day by day. On July 28th, there was another incident of assaulting our military officers. After this incident occurred, the people of several counties in Yanbian, without prior consultation, informed each other and immediately formed a powerful organization to hold a meeting to assist the government officials and vowed to confront the situation to the death. On the day of the meeting, some people bit their fingers and wrote a letter in blood, drafting a declaration to announce to all circles in the country, requesting unanimous support. Recently, the Jilin Provincial Authorities have telegraphed Zhang Shuhan, the negotiator in Yanji, to investigate and report back, and to handle the matter carefully before the provincial order arrives to avoid triggering major changes. The declaration is recorded as follows: "Jilin Yanji Longjing Village is an important town on the Chinese Yanbian border. Japan calls it Jiandao, revealing its intention to annex it. A Japanese Consulate General has been specially established, with branch offices in Yanhun and Wangqing. More than 400 armed police officers have also been forcibly set up, ostensibly to protect expatriates, but in reality, they are carrying out aggression. In recent years, they have destroyed our customs, forcibly built railways, interfered in our administration, poisoned our people, and sent armed police officers to arrest people without cause, acting arrogantly and recklessly in all kinds of barbaric ways. Recently, on July 28th, the 1st Battalion of the 7th Regiment of the 13th Brigade of the local garrison army learned that some Korean civilians were gathering to gamble and extort money. The garrison army sent Zhang Fengquan, the second company commander, along with three plainclothes soldiers to arrest them. Three gambling offenders were caught on the spot and were about to be taken back to the company for interrogation. As they passed in front of the Japanese police station, the Japanese police suddenly interfered. Company Commander Zhang argued with them on the grounds of reason, but the Japanese police were unreasonable and did not listen. They summoned many Japanese police officers and beat Company Commander Zhang for a long time, and took him to the Japanese Consulate. Company Commander Zhang was wearing an army uniform, which was torn and tattered, and he was covered in bruises. There is a certificate from a British doctor as evidence. The facts are clear. The Japanese police officers and consuls are still trying to defend themselves with a hundred excuses. The local people are angry and agitated and vowed not to live with the Japanese police. When the municipal people's congress was convened, the masses bit their fingers and wrote blood letters. They have unanimously decided to protest seriously to the Japanese side, demanding the withdrawal of the Japanese police in Yanbian, the punishment of senior Japanese police officers and the Japanese police officers who caused the incident, and a formal apology to our country in order to uphold the national system and maintain sovereignty. The border people vow to resist unanimously to the death. Therefore, we present this statement in blood and respectfully hope for your attention. Jilin Yanji County Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, and Student Joint Association." (August 6th)</p>
<h3>Sales of Dong Province Soybeans in Germany</h3>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: The Eastern Province is a soybean-producing region, and also the only major exporter. However, agricultural production and commercial transport are both lacking in improvement and are gradually declining, resulting in many obstacles in sales to various parts of Europe. Recently, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has forwarded a letter from the German Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, stating the situation of Dong Province soybean sales in Germany in recent years, as it is related to Dong Province's foreign trade. The original letter was copied and sent to the Jilin Provincial Government for investigation, and then forwarded to the Jilin Chamber of Commerce Federation for study. The original letter is extracted below to show that Dong Province soybeans have a considerable position in Germany.</p>
<h3>(I) Soybeans in Germany</h3>
<p>Are purely used for various industries and oil mill enterprises. Soybean oil is used for food and industrial needs. Crushed soybeans are now regarded as the most nutritious feed for livestock, as it is known that feeding cattle with it can increase milk production. The use of soybean flour can also be substituted for other common flours, and it can increase the nutritional quality of bread.</p>
<p>(II) The demand and consumption of soybean oil and other soybean products in Germany are flourishing. The use of soybean oil is particularly important for supplying nutrients. Crushed soybeans are now regarded as the most valuable food.</p>
<p>(III) Crushed soybeans can be substituted for oily seed products such as coconut cakes and peanut cakes. As for soybeans, there is nothing else that can directly replace them.</p>
<p>(IV) According to current news, there is no possibility of a decline in soybeans in Germany this year. The number of imports in the first three months of this year already exceeds that of last year. As for the decline in prices, it is not due to weak demand, but due to the common decline in the prices of agricultural products worldwide. This common decline in the prices of agricultural products will inevitably lead to a sharp reduction in the purchasing power of German farmers and a corresponding reduction in the need for livestock consumption. However, when the above-mentioned prices are low, the demand for soybeans by German farmers still increases.</p>
<p>(V) The number of soybean imports in the past five years is listed below to show the increase in Germany's need for this item:</p>
<p>1925: 336,000 tons</p>
<p>1926: 370,038 tons</p>
<p>1927: 576,096 tons</p>
<p>1928: 847,724 tons</p>
<p>1929: 1,023,858 tons</p>
<p>1930: January to March: 291,715 tons</p>
<p>Germany imports several times more from China than it exports to China. It should be noted that the value of exports to China in 1929 was 190 million gold marks, while the value of imports from China was 365 million gold marks.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Government Expenses Temporarily Issued at 50%</h3>
<p>Limited to August and September</p>
<p>Supplementary Issue After October</p>
<p>Chen Qicai, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department, previously submitted a request to the Provincial Government Committee for discussion on measures due to heavy military spending and financial difficulties. After the 319th meeting of the Provincial Government, three measures were decided: (1) Military police supplies and education subsidies will be issued as usual. (2) The expenses of various agencies will be issued at 50% first, and the agencies will allocate them themselves, temporarily limited to August and September. Supplementary issues will be made successively after October. (3) Other expenses that can be issued later will be determined by the responsible agency and reported to the meeting. The Provincial Government has already issued separate orders to the various departments and associations to follow the procedures and has issued instructions from the Finance Department to the county governments and county finance bureaus to comply with the procedures.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Express Mail</h3>
<p>Since the wounded soldiers caused trouble in Wuhu, the Public Security Bureau has been heavily guarded day and night. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, the 3rd Battalion of the Garrison Regiment dispatched two companies of soldiers to cooperate with the Public Security Bureau's security team to distribute themselves on the roads and at various locations such as the West Gate, North Gate, and Lishe Bridge to conduct inspections of pedestrians. Traffic was cut off after 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>Feng, the commander of the 3rd Battalion of the Garrison Regiment, previously led his troops to Nanling to suppress bandits and captured the bandit leaders Ding Tangming and Zhao Jingwu. Today, soldiers from the 10th Company have been dispatched to escort Ding and Zhao to the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters for review.</p>
<p>The Security Office of the Provincial Government has purchased a large number of guns and ammunition in Shanghai to train two regiments and one special task force of the security team. It is expected to be shipped to the province in about a week and has issued a notice to various counties that they can prepare the price and collect it if needed.</p>
<p>Due to the recent increase in the number of new water stoves in Wuhu, which is detrimental to business, the water stove industry has requested the Municipal Office and the Public Security Bureau to strictly restrict them, but this has not been achieved. It is now decided that all businesses will be suspended starting tomorrow to demand implementation (August 10th).</p>

<p>The neighbor of the Maitreya Temple on Nanchengdu Road, Shanghai, Mr. Liu, the owner of the Liu Mansion, who works at the Gold Exchange, was kidnapped by bandits last month and demanded 50,000 yuan for ransom. After the family members of the victim received several letters, they commissioned someone to negotiate the ransom at the bandit den. After several negotiations, the business was redeemed. Afterwards, a tipster reported to Detective Cao of the Police Department that Yu Baoren, a driver of the Xinglong Auto Company on Disiwei Road, was also involved in the Liu case.

<h3>Suicide Case at Changguang Bridge</h3>
<p>Zhang Bairong (36 years old) from Huashu, Jiangyin County, came to Wuxi with his wife, Ms. Xu (named Ruizhen), a few months ago to seek a livelihood due to financial difficulties. Unexpectedly, an old woman named Granny Yang, who lived on Tonghui Road (Granny Yang specializes in selling women), acted as an intermediary and sold Ms. Xu to Zhang Jiren, the owner of Jiuchengchang Cigarette and Paper Shop outside Guangfu Gate on Wanqian Road, as his wife for 60 yuan. Ms. Xu received 40 yuan, and Granny Yang received 20 yuan. When Bairong came to Wuxi for the second time, he learned the truth. Overwhelmed with shame and anger, he had thoughts of ending his life. He wrote a suicide note at the First Hotel on Malu Wudong yesterday and secretly went to Changguang Bridge at Huangnitou in Guangqin District and threw himself into the river. Around 4 PM, Jin A’mei, the chief of the 17th Tu of that area, discovered the incident and immediately reported it to the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. The bureau dispatched police officer Xia Zixuan to investigate. As a result, a discarded package of green willow twigs, a short shirt, and a suicide note signed by Zhang Bairong were found on the ground. The officers from the Sixth Branch searched for a long time but did not find Zhang's body. They took the belongings and suicide note back to the bureau to be filed for further investigation. It is also heard that Zhang Jiren, knowing the situation was bad after the incident, had already fled elsewhere with Zhang Xu.</p>

Subsequently, the county government sentenced Qin Xifang to six months in prison and Fei Zhongliang to two months in prison. Qin and others, dissatisfied with the verdict, hired lawyer An Ruotai to appeal to the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court summoned both parties to court for interrogation the day before yesterday. After two hours of debate, the verdict was announced yesterday, acquitting Qin Xifang and upholding the original sentence for Fei Zhongliang. However, Gao Zhongyu declared in court that he was dissatisfied and would appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of Yangzhou's City Closure and Market Strike</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Wu, who came from Yangzhou to Shanghai, around 10 PM on the 9th of this month, gunshots suddenly rang out in the bustling Yuanmen Bridge and Duozi Street areas, along with a great commotion. Silence was restored after about two hours. It was later learned that the reason was that an injured soldier had caused trouble at the Yangzhou Bathhouse, which was still under construction on Sucang Street, that afternoon. The person in charge offered six yuan to settle the matter, but it did not satisfy the soldier. He then gathered more people to cause trouble, but was unsuccessful. He then gathered two or three hundred people, distributed them, and began to retaliate. After entering the city, they first seized the firearms of the merchant corps guarding the posts at Yuanmen Bridge and other places, wielding iron bars and, in some cases, fast-firing guns. Fortunately, the merchant corps was well-trained and fought bravely. Only Xiong Xiaoyun and Guo Jufu lost one gun each. Dan Wenyi was injured, but his gun was not lost. However, Ju Zheng Guo, the guard at Yuanmen Bridge, was struck on the head with an iron bar, causing blood to flow, but he was able to hold his gun and break through the siege. He fell several steps away and fired at one of the injured soldiers chasing him, and the crowd scattered. Xie Chaobin, the Chief of Staff of the 133rd Brigade and the Chief of the Joint Military-Police Inspection Office, heard the alarm and led a team on patrol. At Xiaodongmen Longtou Pass, they encountered the perpetrators, who opened fire on them. The crowd retreated, and Xie led the team in pursuit. Most of the perpetrators exited through the South Gate, while the rest scattered. During the disturbance, all the stores in the city were closed, and the city gates were also closed. It was heard that after the Chamber of Commerce and the Brigade Headquarters held a meeting, more soldiers and police were dispatched to the Fortune Gate to open one gate.</p>

<h3>Man Killed with a Punch Due to a Jesting Remark</h3>
<p>Lin Chun, the second son of Tao Jincheng of Huangtang Bridge, Section Two, Qishan Township, Dongwai, was working as a tenant farmer at the Xu family in Qingyangxia Village. The night before last (the 9th), he went home, and his cousin Zibao invited him to eat a late Mid-Year Festival meal. After the meal, Lin Chun saw Zibao's family propping up the door to cool off and jokingly remarked, "Is propping up the door for dead people to sleep?" Zibao, misunderstanding his words, punched Lin Chun in the heart. Lin Chun fell to the ground and died instantly. Later, his mother and wife cried foul. The Public Security Bureau reported to the county for an examination, but the murderer had already fled. Yesterday afternoon, relatives intervened and resolved the matter peacefully.</p>

According to him, there are currently more than twenty bandit ships in the port, holding more than four hundred hostages from various places. Their hair is about a foot long, and they stink terribly. They only eat two meals of sweet potato dried per day. The day before yesterday, more than fifty hostages angered the bandits and were all shot and their bodies thrown into the sea. It was a tragic and unbearable sight.</p>

<h3>Record of Bandit Troubles</h3>
<p>Bandit troops were discovered at Wuxing Port in Funing County. After being repelled by Commander Deng of the 265th Regiment of the 133rd National Revolutionary Army and Police Captain Xiong, they reoccupied the Zhaowangjian, Daxingzhen, and Nandoukan areas. Zhang, the manager of the Huacheng Company, was kidnapped and a ransom of 100,000 yuan was demanded. The firearms of the Hede Company were also robbed. All the places they passed were disrupted and harmed. Local bandits seized the opportunity to rise up like bees, robbing, kidnapping, and killing every day. The people are living in misery. The National Revolutionary Army has temporarily been transferred back to Funing City. The Wuxing Port defense line has ordered Police Captain Huang to lead troops to block and defend it.</p>
<h3>Zhu Ruifeng Arrested, Dongkan Strikes</h3>
<p>Zhu Ruifeng's house, the head of the Dongkan Red Cross Branch, was suddenly surrounded by about twenty people who looked like soldiers at 4 AM on July 29th. They broke down the gate, jumped over the wall, and immediately arrested Zhu Huanwen, Zhu Ruifeng's elder brother, and looted all the valuables in the house, incurring losses estimated at about 30,000 yuan. They then took a boat and bound them away. As a result, all the stores in the town closed, and the people were fearful. Telegrams were sent to the National Government, the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Shanghai Red Cross Headquarters, requesting assistance. It has been three days, and the stores in Dongkan have not yet resumed business.</p>

Last spring, she returned home to renovate her old house. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 4th of this month, bandits suddenly came to extort 1,000 yuan. Eventually, they agreed to 250 yuan. Both sides agreed to pay the money at dusk on the 9th. Ms. Xu gathered the money, and on the night of the 9th, the bandits came to collect the money and left. Unexpectedly, the next morning, the bandits came again, claiming that the money had not been received. They tied up Ms. Xu, beat her, and burned her lower body before taking her away. Around the 11th, after arranging 500 yuan, they were allowed to redeem her. They also forced the neighboring neighbors to be guarantors. If the family of Fei Xu concealed any information, the neighbors would be questioned and burned.</p>

<h3>Threatening Letters One After Another</h3>
<p>Wang Xingqing and Wang Wujin, farmers in Xianfeng Temple, about three miles from Quan Gongting, received two threatening letters on the 2nd and 4th of this month, demanding 1,000 yuan. The Wang brothers ignored them. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 6th, more than twenty bandits, wearing white headbands and carrying firearms, swarmed into the Wang family's house, tied up Xingqing and Wujin, and hung them up, demanding that they pay the money. Wang claimed he had no money, so the bandits beat them. After Xingqing's wife knelt down and pleaded, they agreed to pay 1,000 yuan on the 10th and wrote a promissory note. Only then did the bandits leave. Xu Heshang, Liu A'san, and Zhou Sanzun in the village also received threatening letters demanding 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Huzhou</p>
<h3>Bandit Robbery, Victim Wounded</h3>
<p>Cai Wanrong, a farmer near Dama Town, Deqing County, Huzhou, worked diligently and had a prosperous family. At midnight on the 6th, six bandits with mixed accents and short knives and wooden clubs broke into his house. Cai Wanrong saw that the bandits did not have firearms and tried to resist, but he was outnumbered and wounded by the bandits' knives and clubs. One bandit guarded Wanrong while the remaining bandits entered the house and ransacked all the clothes, silver, and other items. After the incident, Cai's family hired a doctor to treat him.</p>
<h3>Woman Murders Biological Son Due to Affair</h3>
<p>Madam, the wife of the late Wang Zhineng, the owner of Wang Tongchang's bronze and tin shop in Dongzha, Nanxun, is over forty years old and has a lewd nature. After Zhineng's death, Madam had an affair with her husband's nephew, Mr. Jia, and they soon lived together as if they were husband and wife. Zhineng had a son named Wubao, who is now eighteen years old. Two years ago, he married a woman surnamed Mou, and they lived in harmony. However, Madam, deeply afraid that this would be detrimental to herself, incited him from within, falsely accusing her daughter-in-law of misconduct. Wubao was young and ignorant, so he was confused and began to mistreat her. Last year, she was once again severely reprimanded. Later, the woman suddenly disappeared and has not been heard from since. The night before last, Madam colluded with her lover and planned to murder her son, Wubao, with a bayonet. Fortunately, the neighbors on the left and right were not yet asleep and heard a scream. They rushed to rescue him, and Wubao escaped from the tiger's mouth and was not stabbed to death. The neighbors arrested the adulterer and adulteress and sent them to the Public Security Bureau of the town for legal proceedings.</p>

<h3>Continued Record of Fan Shoukang's Escape</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Fan Shoukang, the former principal of Chunhui, escaped danger, visitors have been flocking to his door every day. Here is an excerpt from his conversation, which was not fully reported earlier: When I was kidnapped and taken by the bandits in the dark, I fell more than thirty times on the narrow and dilapidated streets. When passing the Wu Zixu Temple, I accidentally fell into a muddy field. When the bandits helped me up, my shoes were gone. I ran barefoot on the sandy and rocky road for more than an hour. My soles were blistered, and I could barely stand. Then the bandits gave me cloth shoes to wear before I reached the place where I was imprisoned. There were four bandits guarding me. Every afternoon, one bandit would go out and return with a bucket of corn to feed me. Aside from occasionally making pointless consolations, someone from Shanghai would come here every other day. These people were extremely secretive and had been trained. I heard from one of them that their party members were all over Yuyin, Yu, Ci, Xin, Sheng, Fenghua, and other counties, numbering about one division or more. I also heard that the Chunzhong Nursing School Sports Committee planned to celebrate the success of the escort and the escape of the former principal at the beginning of the semester.</p>
<h3>Another Case of Smuggling Rice Out of the Territory</h3>
<p>After the Kang Rice Company outside the East Gate caused public outrage among the people by smuggling early rice out of the territory, unfortunately, a similar incident occurred in Songxia Town in Yuxi, Shangyu. Here is a record of the incident: A few days ago, the Zhou Yihe Rice Shop colluded with a Shaoxing rice dealer nicknamed "Nun" to transport 500 dan of rice in batches by boat out of the territory. Unexpectedly, when passing through the Tan Village of Li Hai Suo and Xiajia bu, it was discovered by the villagers of Qianzhuang Quzui, who rang gongs and gathered a crowd to cross the river to chase them. Two small boats were intercepted, containing a total of more than 100 shi of rice. The rest had already been transported away. The boats, rice, boatmen, and rice dealers were all detained and reported to the village committee, the Public Security Bureau, and other agencies. Two meetings were held at the Sixth Community and the Five Dragon Temple, attended by more than 1,000 people. It was decided to detain the rice dealer, Nun, and hand her over to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The fourteen bags of rice that had not yet been transported were also detained. Later, Yu Yantang and others came forward to mediate the results. The rice dealer, Nun, was released, fined one hundred yuan, forty yuan to be used for the repair of the Five Dragon Temple, and sixty yuan to be allocated to the Fifth District Office. The detained rice was returned in full. The Zhou Yi Tai was leniently exempted from further investigation. Afterward, the people there decided on two measures: (1) Strictly prohibit rice merchants from hoarding; (2) If the above situation is found in the future, the confiscated rice will be confiscated, and the informant will be rewarded with three yuan per bag.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from Refugees from Hengfeng, Shangrao, Fleeing to Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Hengfeng, Shangrao, is located in the central part of eastern Jiangxi. The land is barren and the people are poor. Years of wind, drought, water, and insect plagues have occurred repeatedly. How can we bear this? Since the rampage of the Communist bandits led by Fang Zhimin, Shao Shiping, etc., under the name of the Third International, organized the Soviet puppet government, inciting workers and peasants and anesthetizing the youth, their red flames are more ferocious than floods and beasts. The areas bordering the northwest townships of Hengfeng in Shangrao are particularly close, and therefore, they were the first to be incited. Rumors spread, and people were startled every night, making it difficult for them to sleep. For two years now, the tens of thousands of people in the county have been living in deep water. Since Hengfeng was disturbed and occupied by the Communist bandits, the number of refugees displaced has reached thousands, all of whom have taken refuge in Shangrao City. On February 23rd of this year, Shangrao County was suddenly attacked and occupied by the Fang bandits. The county office and the court were burned down, and most of the shops and residences were looted. More than twenty people were kidnapped, and the loss of property and materials was estimated at more than 200,000 yuan. Fortunately, the county was recaptured in just a few hours, and the refugees were spared from being searched and killed. Unexpectedly, the bandit nests were not destroyed, and there was no large army to suppress them. The bandit forces were rampant and became increasingly severe. The area within ten miles of the city had become a bandit area. At dawn on July 24th, Shangrao County was once again attacked and occupied by the Fang bandits, who gathered a puppet Red Army and peasant bandits numbering about 20,000, with more than 3,000 guns, knives, and spears. From the 24th when they entered the city to the afternoon of the 28th, after the bandits learned of the news of the joint counterattack by various counties, they led their troops to withdraw, occupying the city for four days, searching, burning, killing, and looting from house to house, even worse than before. The exact number of shops and residences looted is unknown. More than 200 people were kidnapped. About 300 people were searched out and brutally killed by the bandits. Most of the shops and residences were destroyed, and property was looted. Corpses were lying all over the city, and the stench was unbearable. The refugees from Hengfeng and the northwest townships of Shangrao who were taking refuge in the city were regarded as counter-revolutionaries and were searched, arrested, and killed with particular cruelty. The refugees who were killed were beheaded, disemboweled, and their hearts dug out. The situation was so tragic that it was painful to even talk about. The loss of property and materials in Shangrao in this tragic invasion by the Communist bandits was more than one million yuan. The essence of the county seat was destroyed without any remains. It was truly a tragedy unprecedented in recent centuries. Although the Communist bandits have retreated outside the city, the bandit area is approaching the county seat and could arrive at any moment. The refugees and others fear that they will come again, so they are helping the old and carrying the young. The number of those who gathered reached more than 5,000. First, they fled to Yushan, but because Yujing borders Shangrao, rumors abounded. The refugees were all fleeing from the gunshots and bullets of Shangrao City. Having just left the dangerous situation, they were like frightened birds, no longer protecting themselves. They fled from Yu to Zhejiang. Now, they are in Changshan, exposed to the wind and sleeping in the open, without clothes or food, looking up to their homeland. The fields and houses are no longer theirs. They have endured all the pain of displacement, with no tears to shed. Hengfeng has been tragically disturbed by the Communist bandits for four years, and the county seat has been occupied by the bandits for nearly a year. If there is no large army to suppress them, the tens of thousands of displaced people in the two counties will inevitably become starving corpses and take the risk of becoming bandits. If the government can show compassion and rescue them, it should quickly send a large army to station at the key locations of Shangrao and Hengfeng, order them to carry out the suppression, and set a deadline for the elimination of the bandits. At the same time, it should carry out a clearing of the countryside to eliminate the source of the bandits and eradicate the roots. Furthermore, the more than 5,000 refugees, helping the old and carrying the young, who are taking refuge in Changshan, Zhejiang, are all citizens of the country and our compatriots. They should be treated equally. We should quickly distribute grain to provide appropriate relief to maintain their livelihoods and not let them wait anxiously for their fate. The representatives of the refugees from Hengfeng and Shangrao counties taking refuge in Changshan, Zhejiang, Zeng Renmin, Wang Hengyuan, Fang Chengjun, and others, more than 5,000 people, together bow and request.</p>

<h3>Cai Pei Returns to Office After Leave</h3>
<p>Discusses the Situation of Maintaining the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</p>
<p>Cai Ziping, the Director of the Navigation Administration Department dispatched by the Ministry of Communications to Shanghai to serve as acting managing director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, informed Minister Wang Boqun at the beginning of his tenure that he could only maintain the position for ten days and requested that the National Government appoint someone to take over. Last week, Cai requested leave to return to Beijing due to his wife's severe stroke and strongly resigned from his concurrent position to Minister Wang. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which was on the verge of collapse, suddenly appeared to be without a leader. The company's labor union sent a telegram to the ministry requesting maintenance, and Minister Wang urged Cai to quickly return to the office after his leave and to take on the difficult task. Cai, urged by Minister Wang, arrived in Shanghai on the Sunday night train and reported to the office yesterday to resume his duties as usual. The reporter made a special visit to ask about the future of the bureau, and he answered as follows:</p>
<h3>Continues to Serve Concurrently</h3>
<p>The reporter asked Cai whether he came to Shanghai this time to formally assume the position of managing director. Cai replied that he has always been indifferent to officialdom. He initially strongly declined the position of managing director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and only agreed to serve concurrently for ten days. Later, due to his wife's illness, he returned to Beijing to attend to his personal affairs. However, Minister Wang again urged him to return due to public and private considerations, so he came to the bureau again to continue serving as acting managing director. He has again requested the National Government to appoint someone. If the official personnel arrive at the bureau tomorrow, he will immediately hand over his duties and return to his original position in the Navigation Administration Department. Currently, the First Section is temporarily acting as the managing director, as he is determined not to hold this position of managing director.</p>
<h3>Financial Problems</h3>
<p>The most difficult point at present is the financial problem. The reporter asked about his plans for finance. Cai replied that as an acting official, he could not talk about plans. However, at this time, when the bureau is riddled with holes, he will do his best to raise some funds to pay the arrears of salaries to sailors and seamen so as not to hinder shipping. The arrears of salaries for the office staff in the bureau for several months are also being planned to be issued in some amount to maintain everyone's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Tidying Up the Future</h3>
<p>When a reporter inquired about tidying up the future, Cai [Yuanpei] replied that Zhao Tieqiao had been in charge for over two years but still failed to cure the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's (招商局) illness, and it was even worsening. Considering the current situation, the company's condition was not yet beyond salvation. If one could carefully research and find ways to reorganize, it was not impossible to revive it. However, as he was not a reorganization specialist, he need not add his opinions. When the National Government appoints a specialist, they will naturally have their own methods. For now, he was merely acting as a temporary substitute, and everything would proceed according to existing procedures, with each department responsible for its own work. He would primarily maintain the status quo. What he could firmly guarantee was that he would not allow shipping to be suspended for even a day while he was in office. This he could tell the reporter. The reporter then took his leave.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's German Consulate Tea Party</h3>
<p>German Nationals Celebrate the Anniversary of the Establishment of the Constitution</p>

Chen Shiguang, the Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and representatives from various institutions attended. The host and guests happily dispersed around noon.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Bureau of Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>Preparing to Implement a Publicity Plan</p>
<p>Inspection Work to Begin Soon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bureau of Weights and Measures has been under preparation since the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau submitted a request to the Municipal Government to establish a preparatory office three months ago. During this time, matters such as examining and sending inspection personnel, implementing temporary surveys of weights and measures, convening workshops for various weights and measures manufacturing stores, compiling various promotional materials and commodity price conversion tables, etc., have all been completed. The staff sent to Beijing for training at the end of last month have also returned to the bureau one after another. Recently, the Social Affairs Bureau consulted with the Manufacturers of Flower and Tree of Xiejiao Guild to rent the guild's surplus rooms for the bureau's office. Construction and renovation of the building began immediately. Zhou Zanming, a staff member and technician of the bureau, was concurrently appointed as the director of the bureau to take charge of everything. Preparations are now complete and the bureau was officially established yesterday, operating at the new location. The first step of work, it is said, will be to implement the pre-determined publicity plan. As for the inspection work, it will begin after the revision and promulgation of the regulations on weights and measures equipment from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Returned to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Met with Zhu Shaoyang and Others Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting went to the Foreign Affairs Discussion Association office at 10:00 yesterday morning to pay his respects. Zhu Shaoyang, Song Ziliang, Wu Tianfang and others were present. He returned to his residence to rest at noon. Wang left by car for Beijing at 2:45 yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Chongguang Talks About Negotiations Regarding the Changsha Incident</h3>
<p>Demanding Compensation for Damages</p>
<p>Shanghai, 11th (Electrocution News Agency) - Acting Minister Chongguang met with a group of reporters today and gave a speech saying that negotiations regarding the Changsha incident were still in progress because the investigation of the actual situation had not yet been completed. The Japanese government hoped for a speedy resolution because there was a precedent of the Nanjing and Hankou incidents. The preliminary investigation by Japanese Consul Kasuya in Changsha was scheduled to be completed on the 9th, but the official report had not yet been received. The investigator specially dispatched by Foreign Minister Wang should arrive in Changsha by today and begin the investigation. Negotiations on the specifics would begin after both sides had completed their investigations. The investigation would be conducted by either the investigative organs of both parties or a newly formed Sino-Japanese joint investigation commission. However, it had not yet been determined. Naturally, the Japanese side would demand compensation for damages based on the Japanese side's investigation. The National Government had already taken full measures in places such as Hankou and Jiujiang and would certainly not allow a second Changsha incident to reoccur.</p>
<p>Incidents Involving Merchant Ships</p>
<h3>Yichang Boiler Explosion</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Hakka people at this port from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River received a telegram from Yichang stating that during its voyage upstream from Chongqing, the Yichang, a steamer of the American company, Yangtze Rapid Steamship Company (捷江公司), the boiler in the engine room suddenly exploded due to excessive heat. It is said that the machinery was completely damaged and the hull of the ship was also damaged by the explosion. Whether the crew members were injured is not yet known in detail. This telegram was received by the Hakka community, and the company has not yet provided any detailed information.</p>
<h3>Jiang Yu Repairs Bow</h3>
<p>The bow of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang Yu steamer was damaged when it was hit by Jardine Matheson's De He steamer near Huangzhou earlier this month. Yesterday, the Jiang Yu returned to Shanghai and docked at the Yangjiadu wharf at 4:00 PM. The damaged area was above the waterline, and even the anchor hawse was damaged. It was scheduled to dispatch engineers to inspect it this morning and then enter the dock for major repairs. Jardine Matheson has already acknowledged liability for the repair costs.</p>
<h3>Collision Between Japanese and German Ships</h3>
<p>Nippon Yusen's Rokkakumaru, arriving in Shanghai from Japan, entered the Wusongkou at 9:00 AM on Saturday. It collided with the North German Company's steamer Atoran, which was being operated by Melchers &amp; Co. and was departing at the time because they were unable to avoid each other. The German ship damaged the starboard side of the Rokkakumaru, with the damage extending 20 feet. Fortunately, it was above the waterline, so it was still able to sail and has now gone to Japan for inspection before being repaired.</p>
<p>Compilation of Memorial Week Activities in Various Organizations</p>

<h3>Record of the General Meeting of the Red Cross Society</h3>
<p>Resolved to Invite Chairman Wang Yiting to Preside over the Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Chinese Red Cross Society held a temporary meeting of member representatives at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association on the second floor. Sixty to seventy people attended. Hu Hongji, a representative from the National Government, and Yan Sen, a representative from the Municipal Government, attended. Wang Peiyuan, Zhou Guangjiu, and Wang Fuqing were publicly elected as chairmen, and Ji Zhongze and Ji Heqin were appointed as recorders. After performing the rituals, the chairman reported on how the first vote had not been completed, leading to a re-election, which was also illegal. They discussed how this should be resolved and that the qualifications of the attending representatives should be strictly reviewed before the meeting to avoid repeating the same mistakes. Jiang Daqiu proposed the election of three people as a review committee. The chairman submitted it for a vote, and there were no objections. Member Dong Xinqin proposed that there was no quorum of representatives. The chairman replied that according to Article 54 of the charter, the resolutions of the general meeting of members were limited to the number of attending members. Dong said that the principles of civil rights must be followed. Member Ji Heqin said that the highest organ of the association was the Standing Council. Since the revolutionary army secured the Yangtze River, not a single motion had complied with the principles of civil rights, and no one had mentioned basing things on the principles of civil rights. The chairman invited Municipal Government representative Yan Sen to speak. Yan said that the government had not yet decided on the election for your association and that to respect your association, all unresolved issues should be resolved by your association itself. The government would not intervene, but it was not easy to convene a meeting, and the government had sent someone to investigate after the dispute arose. They knew that there was a proposal to convene a temporary meeting on August 10. The government hoped for success because procedural issues had to be carefully considered. After the meeting, each member would raise their spirits, take responsibility, and develop the future. The government would not interfere. Under these circumstances, it was hoped that the association would quickly reorganize itself. Today's chairman had not arrived, which was not in accordance with the charter, but the government's meaning had been stated in the newspaper. The four items that were to be handled today were issues of the association itself, not government issues. The government's responsibility was supervision and it could not resolve legislative issues for your association. The situation today should be reported to the government for reference and decision. The government could not advise on whether the meeting could be held or whether it was legal because there was a charter to follow. Representative Jiang Daqiu of the Huai'an branch proposed to publicly invite the chairman to attend the meeting, and more than five people seconded the motion. Dong Xinqin proposed to retroactively recognize today's meeting as a discussion meeting, which was approved by all. As a result, Ji Heqin was publicly elected to draft a telegram to Wang Yiting: "Representatives have arrived at the meeting and generally agree that the meeting cannot be held without the chairman's attendance. We urgently hope that you will come to Shanghai immediately. The public is deeply expectant. The representatives and members attending the Third Temporary General Meeting of the Chinese Red Cross Society kowtow." Member Ji Heqin proposed that if the chairman had asked for leave three days ago, Mr. Huang Han should act on his behalf. Mr. Huang took responsibility and held two Standing Council meetings and one Executive Committee meeting within five days. Today, he suddenly sent a letter saying that he was suffering from diarrhea and hemorrhoids. Why would he be robust for Li Yingguang's scheme to become chairman but succumb to illness today? There were only three Standing Council members who attended the meeting. Mr. Yao Yuqin sat down briefly and left. Mr. Yuan Zhongwei and Ha Shaofu were still present. Why were the councilors who could attend a meeting two days ago unable to come today? If the chairman and councilors use passive methods to resist and make it impossible for the meeting to be held, we will only have to request the government to send someone to supervise and have the branch associations publicly elect representatives to take over the headquarters. Everyone applauded and supported this proposal. Dong Xinqin proposed that if the chairman pretends to be ill and does not come, we will send representatives to respectfully request his presence. Li Zhenbang of the Taian branch proposed that now that there are natural disasters and man-made disasters everywhere, and corpses are lying unburied, rescue and protection are the responsibility of our Red Cross Society. Why are the gentlemen of the Standing Council standing idly by? The Red Cross constitution stipulates that a meeting is held every three years. Why has it not been held for eight years? Although it was held this year, the dates were changed, changed, and changed again, a total of four or five times. Now there is a letter and telegram notification to hold a meeting on August 10, and the branches are sending representatives to Shanghai. The Standing Council sent a letter inviting them to go to the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association at 2:00 PM this afternoon. Why did the chairman, vice-chairman, etc. of the Standing Council not attend? In such hot weather, our branch representatives and members are suffering in vain, and the association's affairs are unnamed and trifling. I very much support the items proposed by the gentlemen. If the chairman does not come, we will prepare our own travel expenses to go to Ningbo to hold a meeting. Everyone applauded and supported the proposal and then dispersed.</p>
<h3>Workers at the Lianglu General Factory Re-Raise Demands</h3>
<p>Director Liu Scheduled to Reply on Monday</p>
<p>The artisans of the Wusong General Factory of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Ningbo Railways, due to the recent impact of gold prices on their livelihood and the difficulty of maintaining a living, requested rice subsidies and housing allowances from the Railway Bureau the other day, as reported in the Japanese newspaper on the 9th. It is now known that the artisans waited quietly for a resolution because the person in charge of the factory promised to relay everything to Director Liu for explanation. However, as there was still no response as of yesterday, the labor union re-submitted this request and asked the railway authorities to explain why those with salaries above 100 yuan received a 25% housing allowance, while those with salaries below 100 yuan received nothing. At this time of high prices, it inevitably made those who enjoyed huge salaries feel richer economically, while low-paid employees who were in dire straits were increasingly unable to make ends meet, and the authorities had not issued any remedial measures. This was unfair in both reason and emotion. It was also stipulated that the rice subsidy must be based on a rice price of 12 yuan as the highest, and if the market price rose to 20 yuan, each person must be given a rice subsidy of 8 yuan per month, which would be issued at the end of each month along with the monthly salary. As for housing allowances, all those below 100 yuan would receive an additional 25% of their salary to show fair treatment, and the Railway Bureau was given 20 hours to reply. Liu Weichi, the Director of the Railway Bureau, summoned Cai Jinhai and other representatives of the factory yesterday afternoon to explain everything. The representatives also stated their opinions and requested that the railway authorities accommodate them. Director Liu accepted the request and promised to relay it to Minister Sun this Thursday and give an official reply next Monday, hoping that all workers would wait quietly for a resolution.</p>
<h3>Xiang Sheng Factory Resolves Rice Subsidy Issue</h3>
<p>The issue of workers at the Xiang Sheng Iron Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, requesting an increase in rice subsidies of 2 yuan per person per month from the employer was reported in the previous newspaper. It is now known that the request was successfully resolved yesterday. The employer agreed to increase each worker's wages by 5 cents of silver each day, which was only half a yuan less than the original request per month, and claimed that it was because the factory's business was slack. This was not a lack of consideration. Labor representatives Zhang Linhua, a standing committee member of the labor union, and translator Xia Zhenru negotiated back and forth, and both sides agreed to this request, which was approved to be implemented on August 13. It was also heard that the labor union's affiliated voluntary elementary school was overcrowded with new students this semester, and the existing classrooms were insufficient, so they rented a room from the Japanese-Chinese Workers' Union building as a classroom. At the same time, they requested an increase in subsidies from the factory, which was also approved by the factory foremen, Peng Si and Tang Baluo, to increase the subsidy by 40 yuan per month.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's News on the Strike of the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers</h3>
<p>The French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Union had originally scheduled to convene a general meeting at the Public Sports Ground yesterday afternoon, but it was changed to a discussion meeting at the union's office on Luban Road at 4:00 PM for other reasons. More than 700 members attended. Xu A'mei was publicly elected as chairman. After performing the rituals, the chairman reported that the union had sent representatives Lu Guanhong, Shen Keming, Xu A'mei, and Zhang Renjun to inquire with the Municipal Party Department about the Central Party Department's mediation of the case. Comrade Chen Junyi, a standing committee member of the Municipal People's Training Association, received them and said that Mr. Li Shizeng of the Central Government was actively mediating the matter and had negotiated with the French Consul several times regarding the preconditions proposed by the union. A satisfactory resolution should be reached soon, and the union was asked to wait patiently for the mediation of the higher authorities. The preconditions were as follows: (1) The French authorities were requested to release the arrested workers as soon as possible. (2) The issue of wage increases was that each person would receive an additional 2 yuan and 4 jiao of silver per month. (3) The factory would pay the wages of the workers during the strike period. (4) The issue of the employer dismissing workers would be mediated by Mr. Li Shizeng, and all dismissed workers would be allowed to work in the union office, with their monthly wages paid by the factory. This matter was still under negotiation, and if there were results, representatives from both labor and management would be convened to discuss it and resolve it. Finally, the following resolutions were discussed: (1) What should be done about the case of union worker Zhou Longhu being captured by Wang Wenjie, Wu Qinsheng, and Yuan Along when he passed by the company's gate, severely beaten, and sent to the police station? It was resolved to submit a request to higher authorities for a prompt and serious negotiation. (2) A request should be submitted to the Municipal Party Department for the protection of human rights in the case of worker spies privately capturing loyal workers.</p>
<h3>Telegram from Two Postal Unions to Minister Wang</h3>
<p>Telegram from the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, etc., to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Transportation in Nanjing: We are greatly relieved that the Shanghai postal workers, in order to resolve the ten outstanding cases, were about to cause a major storm. Fortunately, you have shown consideration for the situation and have insight into the crux of the postal workers' suffering, and have specially sent a commissioner to consult with our union, etc. Director-General Wei has also met with us with sincerity, and we have been able to bring this to a close in this time of crisis and achieve a satisfactory resolution. Our union, on behalf of the postal workers nationwide, would like to express our sincere thanks to you. However, there is something we must say: all of our postal workers are inspired by the righteousness of our party, and we are more sincere in our love and protection of the post office than anyone else. As for the ten outstanding cases, they are all about the improvement of postal construction, the preservation of the post office's original good system, and the improvement of the lives of postal workers across the country. Our postal workers have studied these cases and unanimously believe that if the previous postal authorities could have studied them with the slightest sincerity, it would not have been difficult to accept them on the day they were proposed. Why did they delay them for a year, resulting in these outstanding cases? The previous postal authorities' disregard for the demands of our union, etc., was the main reason for causing this storm. During this year, our union, etc., endured pain and bitterness, eagerly anticipating a result like this, which is why we had to give a limited-time response. Our union, etc., deeply knows the difficulty of building the post office and does not want to cause a storm to create various unfortunate disputes. Therefore, in this serious situation, we remained calm and sought a final solution. Fortunately, with your wise observation and the assistance of Director-General Wei, the cases were satisfactorily resolved under the consultation of both parties on August 4, which is gratifying. From this, we know that none of the demands put forward by our union, etc., are unreasonable or unsolvable, but can be resolved by opening up and consulting in good faith. We hope that in the future, you will abandon your suspicions and eliminate the barriers to our union's suggestions and meet us with sincerity. If our postal workers are not mindless or insane, they will never harm the post office, which is the foundation of their survival. If you adopt this suggestion, the future of the post office will depend on it. We respectfully await your enlightened teachings. Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, Shanghai Postal Employees' Union, together with our respect.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Federation Issues Declaration</h3>
<p>Regarding Foreign Insurance Companies</p>
<p>According to the Guo Wen News Agency, the Shanghai Federation of Citizens issued a declaration yesterday regarding foreign insurance companies: The Fuzhou Guild recently informed various groups that on November 5, 1928, the Xin Ji steamship of the China Merchants Bureau was loaded with goods and set sail for Fujian. When the ship sailed to Caoshidao, it hit a reef due to fog, causing the goods worth more than 300,000 taels to be completely submerged. Before the Xin Ji sailed, the guild insured the goods with Baler, Allied, Sino-American, American, American-Asia, American-China, Hanli Baoxing, and Baotai companies for a total of more than 300,000 taels and obtained insurance policies as proof. After the Xin Ji accident, the Fuzhou Guild requested compensation, but the insurance companies refused to pay on various pretexts. The guild first sued a portion of the Berlin Hamburg Land and Sea Transport Company, which had been transferred by Baoxing Company, to the Shanghai Temporary Court last September. On March 20 of this year, the court ruled that the defendant should pay the full amount and 6% annual interest. The company was cunning and refused to accept the judgment and appealed, which is still being litigated. The Baler, Allied, Sino-American, American-Asia, American, American-China, Hanli, and Baotai companies still disregard Chinese merchants and credibility and refuse to pay compensation. In addition to having resolved to deal with the situation by: (1) submitting a request to the government to order foreign insurance companies to register; (2) issuing a notice to merchants to refuse to insure with unregistered foreign insurance companies; (3) stating that the government will not accept any compensation claims from merchants who insure with unregistered companies in violation of the notice. The Shanghai Federation of Citizens specially issues a declaration to all merchants in the country to pay attention and absolutely no longer insure with the above-mentioned foreign insurance companies that refuse to pay compensation, and urge them to become aware and register with our government to exercise the scope of business and prevent future events that damage commercial credit and refuse to pay insurance claims. Furthermore, the purpose of foreign merchants establishing insurance companies is to make profits, which is also a part of economic aggression. Although the establishment of foreign insurance companies was not considered economic aggression, their operation of the insurance business in our country is not supervised by our government, so there are acts of refusing to pay compensation. This is obvious and clear economic aggression. Our country's merchants have long been anesthetized by the sweet talk and enticements of foreign insurance companies and buried under brutal economic aggression, which is countless for centuries. Now our country's merchants should also know the purpose and means of foreigners. If you don't realize it now, the future troubles will be even deeper. The Shanghai Federation of Citizens, in order to prevent and save the situation, and contribute its loyal advice, requests that our merchants be self-respecting and no longer be deceived by foreign merchants. Please be careful and hereby declare it. The Shanghai Federation of Citizens Preparatory Committee.</p>

<h3>Anti-Opium Society Establishes Overseas Branch</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society has been extremely concerned about the suffering of overseas Chinese from the opium monopoly. Last spring, it sent the society's director-general, Huang Jiaohui, to Nanyang and other regions to promote its work, which was very effective. The leaders of the Chinese communities in Singapore in particular expressed their sympathy and began to organize anti-opium groups. For the sake of convenience, they promoted the revival of the original Zhenwu Charity Society. After four months of preparation, they elected responsible officers last month, who were sworn into office. They are now establishing branches in various British-controlled ports. The society's chairman, Chen Shunan, vice-chairman, Lin Jindian, executive committee members, Zhou Xianrui, Luo Chengde, etc., sent a letter yesterday reporting as follows: "Respected Sirs: Since opium was imported into our country more than 80 years ago, the scourge of opium has spread throughout the country. The pain and suffering have caused people throughout the country to wring their hands in anguish and fear the decline and fall of our country. We have been calling out loudly and trying to save it. Five years before the founding of the Republic of China, the Japanese first founded this society in Singapore. At the same time, the British-controlled islands of Malaya were also established. The British-controlled states of Malaya held their first anti-opium conference in Perak the following year, and the momentum was very enthusiastic. The promotion of smoking cessation was very effective. When the European War broke out in 1914, the local government banned various societies from holding meetings and discussions, and this society became inactive. However, we have never forgotten the importance of reorganizing the society and restoring its former glory. This spring, your society's director-general, Mr. Huang Jiaohui, came to Nanyang to investigate the opium situation. When he passed through Singapore, he told us about the tragic situation of the opium scourge in recent years. We were even more alarmed and rushed to call for action. On March 8, we convened a general meeting of new and old members of this society at the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce to welcome Director-General Huang and discuss the situation. We unanimously agreed to revive the society and elected a preparatory committee to carry out the process. After four months of preparation, the procedures were completed. On the 15th of last month, we held a general meeting of members to pass the constitution and hold elections. On the 20th of this month, all officers were sworn into office and held their first meeting, resolving to send letters to Chinese community leaders in various British-controlled ports to urge them to unite against opium, and to persuade our overseas Chinese to resolve to quit smoking, and to contact anti-opium groups at home and abroad to cooperate and work together to achieve the goal of eliminating opium. Your society leads the anti-opium movement and is admired throughout the country. Mr. Huang Jiaohui's mission to Nanyang has also given our society a great boost in its revival. We hereby record the case and ask for your review and guidance. We look forward to your guidance and assistance."</p>
<h3>Printing Business Not Mortgaged to Japanese Merchants</h3>

We have forwarded the original and duplicate orders to the color and lead printing trade associations to investigate and report back. Now, on July 31st, we received a letter from the Lead Printing Trade Association stating that none of its members have sold or mortgaged their businesses to Japanese merchants, and they have earnestly advised them not to be tempted by Japanese merchants to engage in private sales or mortgages in the future. On August 6th, we received a letter from the Color Printing Trade Association stating that they have more than forty members in the same industry and have sent personnel to investigate, and have not heard of any such incidents. If the Sixth District Party Department has any knowledge, it can provide the names of the businesses for investigation and assistance." We hereby submit a document for your review and forwarding for public convenience.</p>
<h3>Commodity Inspection Bureau Acting as Agent to Inspect Military Clothing Materials</h3>
<p>Entrusted by the Quartermaster Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has previously been entrusted by the Quartermaster Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs to inspect various items such as cotton and military blankets, and the inspection reports have been highly accurate. The department is very satisfied with this service. Now, the department is purchasing a large quantity of military-use khaki woolen fabric in Shanghai to be used for military uniforms. In order to determine whether the quality of the fabric meets the standards of the sample fabric, the department has specially ordered Director Yan of the Material Section of the Storage Department to travel to Shanghai to deliver a letter to the bureau requesting assistance with the inspection. The letter states that the department has ordered a large quantity of military-use khaki woolen fabric from Shanghai merchants. Detailed agreements have been made regarding the ratio of wool to cotton, the quality of cotton and wool, the number of warp and weft yarns, the weight per yard, the warp and weft density per square inch, the width, tensile strength, and insulation properties. Now, the merchant has delivered the first batch of woolen fabric, and in order to determine whether its quality meets the requirements stipulated in the signed contract, we have extracted the quality clauses from the contract and request your bureau to conduct an inspection and provide us with the results. Upon receiving the letter, the bureau immediately sent personnel to the Dahua Woolen Mill to take samples for inspection in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Passenger on Small Boat Drowns in River at Night</h3>
<p>Driver Unable to Rescue</p>
<p>The Xiaoguang class head small boat of the Asia Petroleum Company departed from the Xinkuan Wharf on Hankou Road at 8 PM last night, carrying passengers to the company's wharf in Pudong. While passing the Lujiazui pier, a middle-aged man suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide when no one was paying attention. The captain immediately stopped the boat to rescue him, but due to the darkness of the night, he had already disappeared without a trace. Afterwards, the second captain, Ye Xigen, reported the incident to the water police station for record. It is said that the man was wearing a white undershirt and blue cloth pants, and was about thirty years old.

<h3>Small Fire at Huashang Electric Company</h3>
<p>At 3:35 PM yesterday afternoon, a fire broke out at the Huashang Electric Company in the south of Shanghai. Two large thatched houses, each divided into four small rooms, totaling eight rooms, used to store materials such as steel rails and asphalt, were unoccupied. The northern four small rooms, containing steel rails, asphalt, cement, lime, carpentry wood, and metalworking materials, suddenly caught fire for unknown reasons. Upon hearing the alarm, the company's Traffic Director Zhu Shaoyi and Engineering Section Director Song Ziyuan immediately led the employees to try their best to rescue the situation. They immediately reported to the Dongjiadu and Nanxi fire stations, which dispatched fire trucks to the scene. The fire trucks arrived quickly and bravely fought the fire. The Songhu Garrison Command also received the report and immediately dispatched a platoon of soldiers from the 26th Regiment stationed near the Gaochangmiao Arsenal, as well as the arsenal's guard team and the Gaochangmiao Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, to maintain order at the scene. The fire was extinguished at 4:10 PM. As a result, four thatched houses were destroyed, causing damage to teak, asphalt, lime, etc., totaling approximately 2,000 yuan. It is said that the fire was likely caused by the spontaneous combustion of lime and asphalt due to the hot and dry weather. Since it occurred during the day, there were no major dangers. It is said that the thatched houses were originally planned to be demolished and rebuilt as iron houses.</p>

<h3>Ransom Victim Safely Escapes After Being Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Chen Dezhong, owner of Yingfeng Silk Factory</p>
<p>Suddenly Kidnapped by Bandits Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>A Herd of Water Buffalo Blocks the Way</p>
<p>Bandits Abandon Victim and Flee Upon Seeing Pursuers</p>
<p>Chen Dezhong, the owner of Yingfeng Silk Factory in Tanhuaqiao, Pushan Road, Zhabei, and a native of Huzhou, lives at No. 4 Zhili Bi Yanghang, Xinkang Road, Second Malu, in the public concession. He goes to the factory every morning to manage the factory affairs in his own car, concession permit No. 8850, municipal government permit No. 6263. He employs a driver, Xu Yuncheng, from Taizhou. Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, he had breakfast at home and went to the factory as usual, not expecting that disaster was about to befall him.</p>
<h3>Sudden Armed Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Chen Dezhong arrived at the factory around 8:50 AM. Since the factory's products have not been of good quality recently, he planned to visit Baotai Silk Factory in Rihuiqiao, South City. He summoned six employees and ordered the driver, Xu Yuncheng, to drive there. However, when the car passed Pushan Villa, four kidnappers suddenly appeared. Two were wearing blue short shirts and pants, one was wearing a white short shirt and pants, and one was wearing gray short shirts and pants. Three of them pulled out guns and warned everyone not to make a sound.</p>
<h3>Chen Dezhong is Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Although there were many people in the car at the time, they were all intimidated by the weapons and remained silent. The six employees were driven out of the car by the bandits, and one bandit grabbed Chen, turned the car east, and drove towards Dachang. The evicted employees watched as their factory owner was kidnapped, but were unable to call for help and had to report to the Tanhuaqiao security group for assistance.</p>
<h3>Water Buffalo Blocks the Way</h3>
<p>After obtaining the ransom victim, the kidnappers sped eastward at full speed. Unexpectedly, when passing near the Taiyangmiao Road Pingjiang Public Office, a herd of water buffalo suddenly appeared ahead, moving slowly. The bandit driving the car honked the horn frantically, but the stupid water buffalo ran around in all directions upon hearing the sound. Two of them suddenly ran into the road. The bandits, fearing an accident, panicked and crashed the car into the wall of the public office.</p>
<h3>Gripping Ransom Victim's Hands</h3>
<p>At the same time, the ransom victim seized the opportunity to stop the car engine. The engine was damaged instantly and could not be started. The bandits were terrified. One bandit gripped the ransom victim's hands tightly and pressed his head down to hide him in the car. Another bandit got out of the car to inspect the damage, intending to drive again.</p>
<h3>Kidnappers Flee</h3>
<p>After Chen was kidnapped, the evicted employees immediately reported to the security group. Soon, the Taiyangmiao police station of the fourth district, as well as the fourth district headquarters and the detective team, received the report and rushed to the scene with police officers. The bandits saw the detectives coming from afar and knew that their plan had failed. They abandoned the ransom victim and fled in all directions.</p>
<h3>Ransom Victim Survives Narrow Escape</h3>
<p>Chen Dezhong, seeing that the bandits had fled, jumped out of the car and hired a rickshaw to return to the factory. On the way, he met Zhang Shaotang, a silk factory donor, and told him about his narrow escape. He also went to report to the fourth district headquarters police station, and the detectives pursued the bandits for several hours, but failed to capture any of them.</p>
<h3>Uncle's Kidnapping of Nephew Case Judgment</h3>
<p>Russian and Song Sentenced to Five Years Imprisonment and Deportation</p>
<p>To Be Sent to Inland Authorities for Further Punishment</p>
<p>Last month, a sensational case of an uncle kidnapping his nephew occurred at the residence of Mrs. Chen Xing, an elderly woman residing at No. 2 Huabao Alley, Lagenna Road, French Concession. The case has been thoroughly investigated by the special investigation unit of the French Police, including Detective Inspector Jin Jiulin, Chief Detective Li Yaolong, Deputy Detectives Mao Jingen, Qian Yumin, Wang Rusong, and patrol detectives Zhou Yaoting, Zhang Ziying, Zhou Buguang, and others. The main culprits, Luo Henglin, Song Wusheng (also known as Song Huaiqing), as well as Yuan Tianming, Bao Zhiming, and suspects Zhou A'er, Zhou Weixiang, and others, seven in total, were apprehended, and the kidnap victim was rescued. As previously reported, yesterday, the police handed over the group to the French Court for prosecution. Western Inspector Sazier first explained the background, stating that after the plaintiff's grandson was kidnapped, the perpetrators demanded a ransom of over 100,000 yuan, arranging a meeting in Ningbo Road, leading to the case's breakthrough. Subsequently, Attorney Ba He, representing the plaintiff, stated that the plaintiff was too old to appear in court. The first defendant, Luo Henglin, the uncle of the plaintiff's grandson Chen Yongkang, daringly colluded with outsiders to kidnap and demand ransom, was extremely unlawful and requested severe punishment according to the law. Furthermore, the plaintiff's side greatly admired the police's swift detection and resolution of the case and wished to allocate 500 yuan as a reward to the detectives. When questioned, Luo Henglin confessed that he was from Jiaxing and used to be in the foreign goods business, but recently lost his job and, out of desperation, colluded with Song Wusheng and the fugitive Chen A'gen to kidnap his nephew in hopes of extorting money. Song Wusheng confessed that he was previously a secret agent for the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. Luo Henglin had asked Zhu Shanhe to discuss with him the kidnapping of the plaintiff's grandson, so he introduced Chen A'gen to arrange the kidnapping. At the time, Luo said he could get at least 160,000 to 170,000 yuan, and promised to give him 20% of the reward after it was done, but although he knew about it, he didn't assist with the kidnapping. The rest gave evasive answers and hired lawyers to defend themselves. Yuan Tianming confessed that he was sent by Chen A'gen to negotiate with the plaintiff for the money. Bao Zhiming confessed that Chen A'gen sent him to monitor Yuan Tianming's negotiations with the plaintiff. Zhou A'er, Zhou Weixiang, and others all stated that they came to Shanghai and were mistakenly arrested by the detectives, knowing nothing about the kidnapping and requesting a clear investigation. Judge Zhu, the French Consul presiding over the case, sentenced Luo Henglin and Song Wusheng each to five years in the Western Prison, followed by deportation and transfer to inland authorities for punishment. Yuan Tianming and Bao Zhiming were each sentenced to four years in the Western Prison, after which they would be permanently expelled from the Concession. Zhou A'er and Zhou Weixiang were released without charge. The 500 yuan offered by the plaintiff was transferred to the General Inspector to be distributed as rewards to the detectives who handled the case.</p>
<h3>Numerous Knife Wounds on Female Corpse</h3>
<p>Face Hacked Beyond Recognition</p>
<p>Neck Bones and Fingers Severed</p>
<p>Seemingly Killed by Multiple Assailants</p>
<p>The Horrific Sight Was Unbearable to Witness</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a female corpse was discovered in a pond dug by villagers at the end of Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei. The body was covered in blood and flesh, unrecognizable. The Fifth District Police Station investigated and ordered Tan Maokun, the local warden of Que San Tu, to report to the Land Court. Xu, the prosecutor, and Shen, the coroner, were appointed to the scene for examination. The female corpse was found to be about twenty years old, wearing a Xiangyun gauze shirt and pants, with her hair already cut off. Her body had numerous knife wounds, and her face was hacked beyond recognition. The neck bones were severed, and many fingers were cut off. The sight was too horrific to witness. It was suspected that she had been killed by multiple assailants after resisting, resulting in the loss of her fingers. The cause of death was determined to be from injuries, and the body was disposed of at that location after death. Photographs were taken, and the body was collected by the charity and placed in a temporary coffin while the investigation into the killer(s) continues.</p>
<h3>Fat Cow Bursts With Wild Nature</h3>
<p>Rams Through the Streets into Nanhai Goods Store</p>
<p>Smashes Jars and Leaves a Pile of Feces</p>
<p>Shen Linsheng, the owner of Tiancheng Nanhai Goods Store in Caojiadu Town, Shanghai West, has been privately raising several dairy cows without a license to sell milk. Because this area is a prosperous market, he lets his cattle roam in the open spaces near commercial shops and residential houses every day, causing them to trample plants, smash bamboo fences, and cause other damage. The businessmen and residents have suffered greatly. However, due to the friendly relations of neighbors, there was no need to intervene, but yesterday at about 7 PM several cows grazed on the vacant area behind Laogong Mao Store. One of the fat dairy cows suddenly got excited and rushed recklessly to the point where it smashed a bamboo fence of a certain family. It leaped from the small lane and raced into town (that is, the extremely busy Great Western Road) and went straight to Lisanjiaochang, and straight to Dashunfeng Nanhai Goods Store, rushing into the shop, the kitchen, and the earthen jars and other objects, all being smashed. The shop's staff feared something dreadful would happen, so they called the police. They all came to drive the cow away. The cow also left a pile of dung in the hall before leaving. People fled and panicked. When Mr. Shen learned of this he went there and stopped the cow. The police on duty took the owner of the cow, Shen Linsheng, back to the Sixth District Police Station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Emphasizes Public Hygiene</h3>
<p>Fruit Vendors Must Use Gauze Covers</p>
<p>Municipal Health Bureau Ordered to Conduct Regular Inspections</p>
<p>Recently, various fruit stalls along the roadsides in the South City have been selling various kinds of fruits, attracting swarms of flies. Although the Municipal Health Bureau has strictly ordered compliance with regulations to use gauze covers, there are still many vendors who have not complied. The Municipal Government believes that as the weather is hot, eating carelessly can easily lead to illness, making it necessary to take practical measures to prohibit this practice. Yesterday, it specially instructed the Health Bureau to immediately work with the Public Security Bureau to send personnel to conduct inspections and eliminate these practices in order to emphasize hygiene.</p>

<h3>Expansion of Domestic Department Store's Business</h3>
<p>Tongle Amusement Park Temporarily Closed for Internal Reorganization</p>
<p>Since the China National United Department Store decided to extend its business period, various parties have inquired and requested to participate in the store. As most of the original participating manufacturers are willing to continue, there is an urgent need to find ways to expand the store space and improve it. It is said that the entire second floor of the iron building will be developed into a commercial area, and efforts will be made to expand the consignment department to facilitate the consignment of goods from manufacturers in other locations. The Tongle Amusement Park, located on the second floor, was originally renting space from the store and was separate from it. Now, Tongle Amusement Park is temporarily closed for internal reorganization starting yesterday. As the lease agreement between the department store and Tongle Amusement Park is about to expire, it is planned to take it back after the expiration date for self-management or to find someone to take over in order to expand the promotion of domestic goods. Furthermore, in order to attract the interest of guests, the store has decided to hold a riddle-solving contest on the second-floor commercial area from 7 PM to 9 PM every day starting today (12th), with domestic goods as prizes to add to the fun. It is said that riddle masters such as Sun Yusheng, Wu Lianzhou, Xu Hangsu, and Cao Chigong will take turns hosting the event.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Establishment of New Private Cemeteries for Group Tombs</h3>
<p>Existing Ones Will Also Be Appropriately Regulated</p>
<p>The Municipal Government previously surveyed and determined four locations for the construction of public cemeteries in this city, and ordered the Bureau to begin construction on one location in Jiangwan first, as reported previously. Now, it is learned that the Municipal Health Bureau believes that although there are many old group tombs in the city, their locations and constructions are not very suitable. It has specially requested the approval of the Municipal Government to appropriately regulate them to gradually rectify them. In the future, requests from private groups to establish new group tombs will also be restricted.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Merchants to Organize National Goods Export Company</h3>
<p>Zhou Qigang Strongly Supports Progress</p>
<p>In recent years, overseas Chinese have returned to the country to start businesses in succession. Even during this period of unstable political situation, overseas Chinese still do not forget to develop their motherland's industries, which is a good phenomenon. Now, many overseas Chinese, including Huang Yuqing, have returned to the country to investigate the products of various places in China and will organize a large company in Shanghai to export national goods. National products such as silk, tea, porcelain, etc., are in universal demand in various countries. The company will specialize in transporting these national goods to various countries for sale in order to make up for the leakage of foreign goods imports. The overseas Chinese merchants believe that Committee Member Zhou Qigang has been handling overseas Chinese affairs for a long time and is enthusiastic about promoting industry, so they specially requested Zhou's planning of everything. Zhou believes that the overseas Chinese merchants' promotion of national goods is indeed an important plan for saving the country and has given his full support. He has been engaged in planning in Shanghai for the past month. If it can be realized, it will greatly benefit the country.</p>
<h3>Boat Owners and Others Request Dredging of Nanhuiguan and Other Wharves Again</h3>
<p>Boat owner representatives Xing Zhigang and others yesterday submitted a petition to the Municipal Port Authority again, requesting the dredging of Nanhuiguan and other ports, stating that they were petitioning for the dredging of ports to facilitate transportation. They stated that they had previously submitted a petition to the Municipal Government requesting the allocation of large funds to order your bureau to dredge the riverside beaches and reorganize water transportation to maintain navigation, etc. The reply was that although a comprehensive dredging would be costly and have far-reaching effects, it would not be easy to implement at the moment and could be delayed for now. Upon investigation, the Nanhuiguan Wharf and Wanyu Wharf have long been the places where east-west boats from the Pudong area dock in Shanghai. During the seventh year of Xianfeng of the Qing Dynasty, December (1857), merchants such as Deji, Daheng, Wanxiang, Senmao, Hecheng, and Wanyu petitioned Huang, the Shanghai County Magistrate, to erect stone tablets at each of the ports, granting permanent docking rights. To this day, the stone tablets still exist and the writing is clear. A simple inspection will reveal that although the wharves are often repaired, the sand and mud on both sides have accumulated more and more. There are also sampans squatting on the wharves, treating them as homes, so that boats coming to Shanghai cannot dock and have to stay far out in the river. Passengers and goods cannot get on and off safely. It is believed that Shanghai is a world-renowned commercial port, relying entirely on the convenience of port transportation. The Nanhuiguan Wharf is also a famous port in the South City, the lifeline of commerce. Each day, it is relied upon by no less than thousands of people, and the goods transferred are worth no less than tens of thousands of taels of silver. The amount of ship tax paid is also not small. Your bureau is in charge of port transportation and should plan in detail to facilitate transportation. Therefore, we jointly petition your honor to approve the removal of obstacles such as sampans at the Nanhuiguan, Wanyu, Gongyi, and other wharves, and prohibit them from docking. Survey the earthworks and engage in dredging to maintain navigation and facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3>Ning Shao Wen Tai Command Headquarters in Shanghai Apprehends Two Major Bandits</h3>
<p>The bandit suppression command headquarters of Ning, Shao, Wen, and Tai prefectures in Zhejiang Province received a report that the major bandits Wang Xiumei and Chen A'xiu, natives of Ningbo, were hiding in the Shanghai West area. They prepared a transfer document and specially sent detectives Wu Zhenyuan and Wang Yonggui to Shanghai for investigation. The detectives learned that Wang and Chen were hiding at No. 1295 Caoxiebang and No. 135 Maodeli, Xiaodulu. Both locations are under the jurisdiction of the Putuo Road Police Station. The detectives, along with detectives Ma Jialai and Qi Mengqing of the police station, secretly went to apprehend Wang and Chen. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Special District Land Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi preliminarily interrogated them and reviewed the transfer document. He then ordered the detectives to take the two bandits back to Zhejiang to be investigated.</p>
<h3>Cook Executed for Murdering for Money</h3>
<p>Xue Cheng Innocent</p>
<p>Gatt, a British employee of the Jianghai Customs, flaunted his wealth and luxurious attire, which led to his murder by Pan Zhi, a Cantonese assistant to Xue Cheng, the cook he employed. On the 18th of last month, Gatt was lying in his apartment on the third floor of No. 859 North Sichuan Road when Pan broke into the room with a sharp knife and killed him. Afterwards, the police arrested Pan and Xue and sent them to the Special District Land Court. Pan confessed to the murder, while Xue denied any prior conspiracy and invited several witnesses to testify that he was indeed at home on the night of the incident. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge Zhitian presided over the case and sentenced Pan Zhi to death for the crime of murder, depriving him of his civil rights for the rest of his life. Xue Cheng was found innocent, and the kitchen knife was kept on file. After the verdict, the police lawyer Ru Bao Yi requested that Xue Cheng remain in custody pending the appeal period. Both Pan and Xue were then escorted back to the police station.</p>
<h3>Another Accomplice in the Murder of the Butcher Apprehended</h3>
<p>Butcher Wang Caibao was unable to endure the heat at home and slept outdoors at night. He was attacked by Zhu A'da, a fellow butcher, who gathered a group of people to injure his hands and feet. A'da was arrested and suddenly developed heatstroke, and both were sent to the hospital for treatment. It has already been reported that the Harbin police apprehended another accomplice in the case, Qian, a native of Jiangyin, and escorted him to the Special District Land Court yesterday morning. Judge Feng questioned Zhu Shunbao, who was sleeping with Wang Caibao, who testified that Ji was indeed present that night, wielding an iron bar. Ji was also known as Xiao Qian. The defendant confessed that he was in Xiaoshadu that night but knew that someone else was behind it. The court ordered the defendant to be detained pending Wang Caibao's recovery before further questioning.</p>

<p>Wang Jinbao Willing to Be Second Wife</p>
<p>Gao Bingjiang Admits Visiting Prostitutes</p>
<p>Wang Lu, a woman from Ningbo, and her daughter Genbao recently filed a lawsuit in the French Court against Gao Bingjiang, who resides on the upper floor of Xingxin Soy Sauce Garden at No. 1022 Huade Road in the Public Concession, accusing him of seducing a virgin, breaking his promise, and publicly insulting them, requesting the court to investigate and prosecute him. Her complaint states that she only has one daughter named Genbao, who is 18 years old. In the winter of the sixteenth year (1927), she rented the upper floor of the soy sauce garden opened by Gao Bingjiang. Unexpectedly, in March of the following year, the defendant took advantage of her absence and seduced Genbao. At that time, Genbao was only 16 years old. When she found out that her daughter had been seduced, she immediately scolded her daughter and questioned the defendant that since he already had a wife, he should not seduce a virgin. The defendant then asked Chen Zhiqin, a fellow villager, to mediate. Bingjiang was willing to marry Genbao as a second wife. Seeing that the matter was a foregone conclusion, she reluctantly agreed for the sake of her reputation. On the first day of the tenth month of that year, he sent a gold ring and a marriage proposal card in the name of his brother Gao Shunsheng. Following Ningbo customs, she also gave a reply card, agreeing to set another date for the betrothal gifts. However, since then, the defendant transferred his shop to someone else and avoided meeting them, and the marriage was delayed. She was very surprised and asked the original matchmaker, Chen Zhiqin, to search for the defendant everywhere, but he could not be found. It was not until March of this year that she learned that the defendant was now living on Huade Road. She went to find him with her daughter, but the defendant changed his attitude and cursed them when the marriage was mentioned. She had no choice but to drag the defendant to the police station. The defendant still admitted the marriage agreement, but when the case was brought to court, the defendant denied the marriage, falsely claiming that her daughter was a prostitute and admitting to visiting prostitutes. They were fined in transit and quarreled everywhere. Afterwards, she still asked the original matchmaker to inquire about the date the defendant would fulfill the marriage, but he completely denied it. Therefore, she submitted evidence and requested the court to summon him to be punished accordingly. The summons for the hearing was issued yesterday, but the defendant did not appear for excuses. The court ordered him to be detained and the case to be reviewed.</p>
<h3>False Report of a Child's Death to Deceive for a Coffin</h3>
<p>The Insidiousness of Human Hearts Is Evident Here</p>
<p>The coffin distribution society attached to the Yongyi Benevolent Hall in Caojiadu, Shanghai West, is funded by philanthropists and merchants. The regulations stipulate that to give a coffin, it must be introduced by a merchant and verified by the society before the coffin is distributed to ensure that the matter is true. The afternoon before yesterday, a certain merchant introduced a case, reporting that the family of a Cheng, a Jiangbei native living in Hambei, had a 12-year-old boy who suddenly fell ill and died, and they were too poor to afford a coffin. They requested the society to approve the distribution of a coffin. After receiving the report, the society immediately sent investigator Zhu Guisan to the address for investigation in accordance with the regulations. However, as soon as Zhu arrived in front of the Cheng's house, several people stopped Zhu and said that the boy had been dead for two days and that the weather was too hot, causing him to decay, and asked him not to enter to avoid infection. Zhu thought that the rules of the society stipulated that he must investigate the truth, so he boldly entered and saw someone silently lying in the bed. He stared at it for about three minutes and suddenly saw movement in the bed. He suspected something was wrong and stepped forward to lift the quilt. He saw a child staring with his eyes, sweating profusely on his forehead. He carefully observed that the child seemed to be ill but was definitely not dead. Zhu immediately returned to the society and reported that the Cheng family had falsely reported the death to deceive for a coffin. Fortunately, the coffin had not yet been carried to the house. The insidiousness of human hearts today is evident here.</p>
<h3>Passenger Dies After Jumping Out of Train Window</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, a passenger, about twenty years old and wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants, jumped out of the train window as it approached the North Station platform. It is suspected that he did not purchase a ticket. He fell onto the tracks and suffered serious injuries, unable to speak. He was immediately sent to Renji Hospital by the police but died before he could be treated. Yesterday, Yan Liugen, the warden of Ji Yi Tu, reported the case to the Land Court. Prosecutor Xu and others arrived at the scene for examination and ordered the body to be collected for burial.</p>
<h3>Bandit in Little Lion Kidnapping Case Changes Testimony</h3>
<p>Claims He Was Just Taking the Child to Play</p>
<p>Court Orders Summons of Rice Cake Vendor</p>
<p>Chen Huanwen, Jiang Wenxuan, Yang Zhaoxian, and Yang Wang, along with others, kidnapped Xiao Shizi, the four-year-old son of Wu Guisheng, who runs a restaurant at the Youche Wharf, on July 23rd. The next day, the First Section of the First District apprehended the bandits and rescued the hostage in Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai West. After interrogation, the defendants confessed and were transferred to the Land Court for investigation and prosecution. However, the defendants changed their testimony, claiming it was not a kidnapping because Chen Huanwen and the victim's son were cousins and he was just taking him to play. Therefore, Judge Niu opened the court again yesterday for further investigation. According to the victim Wu Guisheng, 45 years old, from Yancheng, who runs a restaurant at the Youche Wharf in Nanshi, Xiao Shizi is my son. On the day of the kidnapping, I went to Nanhai Putuoshan to offer incense and returned home to find that he had already been rescued. It was on July 23rd. My wife went out to buy groceries and left Xiao Shizi at home. At that time, Chen Huanwen also came to my house. Chen Huanwen is related to me by marriage. Later, my son disappeared. According to the rice cake vendor, my son was taken away. My wife suspected Chen Huanwen, so she asked my brother-in-law Zhao Ronghua to look for him. Zhao found Chen Huanwen's mother-in-law, Yang Zhaoxian's mother, and met Yang Zhaoxian, who confessed, so he reported it to the police and they were arrested. But after being kidnapped, they did not ask us for money. Wu Zhang, 45 years old, testified that after entrusting Zhao Ronghua to search, she received a letter the next day instructing her to go to Yinghua Street, saying that Yang Zhaoxian's accomplices were there. She dragged them to the police station, but they were not accepted. The police station then sent a patrol officer with police to Zhoujiaqiao to solve the case. Zhao Ronghua, 41 years old, from Shou County, Anhui, testified that Xiao Shizi disappeared on the 23rd of last month. Wu Zhang ordered her brother to come to me and asked me to look for the Chen family. I went to Yang Zhaoxian's mother's house and asked, and she said that he had gone with Yang Zhaoxian, but she did not know about the child. The next day, I went to Yang's mother-in-law Wang's house to investigate. Later, Yang Zhaoxian came, and Wang asked my second son-in-law, Xu, to call me. I said to Yang Zhaoxian, "If you hand over the person, I will give you 20 or 30 yuan." He refused at first, and I wanted to call the detectives, so he gave me the address, which was in the straw shed at No. 12 Zhoujiaqiao. At that time, three men and one woman, and Xiao Shizi, five people in total, were arrested. There were three reed mats inside. Patrol Officer Zhang Haizhu, 33 years old, from Beiping, currently residing in the First Section of the First District, testified that at 3 or 4 AM on the night of July 24th, we received a report and took a car with Yang Zhaoxian to the straw shed in Zhoujiaqiao and ordered Yang Zhaoxian to knock on the door. We entered and arrested them. The testimony of patrolman Liu Chunxi, 35 years old, from Tai'an, Shandong, first-class patrolman, was roughly the same. The judge then questioned the defendants, who all gave evasive answers and did not admit to being kidnappers. Because the circumstances of the case were strange, the judge ordered that the debate not be opened and that the rice cake vendor and Wu Zhang's brother be summoned for further investigation. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Zhang Chunguang Hangs Himself After Mourning a Friend</h3>
<p>Cause Unknown</p>
<p>Zhang Chunguang, 41 years old, a native of Chaozhou, has been the manager of Jin Yu Pawnshop at No. 97 Quanzhang Hall, Limalu, Sixteenth Shop, Nanshi, for more than 20 years. A few days ago, Zhang's sworn friend, Chen, who opened Yongtai Pawnshop in the Baxianqiao area of ​​the North City, suddenly passed away. Zhang, after hearing the news, went to mourn him the day before yesterday. Around 7 o'clock in the evening, he returned to the store. After dinner, around 12:00 AM, the pawnshop was closed. Because his family lived in the back of the house, Zhang returned to his bedroom. Then, around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, Zhang groped in the dark to the shop, reached out, and opened the drawer of the counter. He was heard by the shopkeeper, who was awakened from his sleep. The shopkeeper asked what was happening, Zhang then closed the drawer, saying it was nothing, and went back to the room. The shopkeeper went back to sleep. Then, Zhang's wife, Zhu, suddenly remembered that her husband had been out for a long time and had not returned, she became suspicious, got up, and called the shopkeeper to search everywhere, but could not find him. When they were led to the package room upstairs, they suddenly saw Zhang had hung himself from the beam with a belt. They felt his body and found that he was already dead. They reported the matter to the chief of the First District, who ordered Lu Yongde, the landlord of the Sixteenth Shop, to report to the Shanghai Land Court to appoint a prosecutor to investigate the scene.</p>
<h3>Two Floating Corpses in Shanghai</h3>
<p>(1) Yesterday morning around 7 o'clock, an unidentified girl's corpse was discovered floating in the Suzhou River under Fujian Road Bridge. The girl was approximately seven or eight years old, and no one has claimed her. Subsequently, a Chinese constable, No. 29, from the Water Police Station came across the body and had it retrieved and sent to the Life Saving Bureau for collection. (2) Again, at 10 o'clock in the morning, an unidentified male corpse floated to the surface of the Huangpu River near the China Merchants Bureau's Jin Li Yuan wharf. The man was wearing a blue cloth shirt and trousers, with sores on his head. He was approximately thirty years old. The Life Saving Bureau's patrol boat retrieved the body and transported it to the Bureau for collection.</p>
<h3>Lodger Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at around 2 o'clock, a customer arrived at the Jiangsu Inn, Mantingfang, Wuma Road, wearing a twill shirt and trousers, appearing to be an intellectual. He only wrote his name as Lu Zhongde, a local resident, seventeen years old, in the guest register. After the tea server led him to room 55, he paid the room fee. Before long, he went out wearing a hat and returned at around 6 o'clock in the evening. It is unknown what caused him to secretly consume lysol. By 10 o'clock, the poison took effect, and his groans reached outside the room. At first, the tea server and others suspected he was suffering from heatstroke, but gradually his complexion turned pale, his eyes became fixed, and his mouth remained open. The accountant's office promptly notified the Old Gate Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Constable No. 2706 to arrive and transport him by vehicle to Renji Hospital for treatment. His life is said to be in critical condition.</p>
<h3>Axes and Pistols Fired Together</h3>
<p>Yun Xiaorong Severely Injured</p>
<p>Yun Xiaorong, a thirty-two-year-old Nanjing native, currently resides on Shantou Road in the Public Concession and is an unemployed hooligan. He previously worked as a protector in various gambling dens in the Public Concession (commonly known as "baotaijiao"). Later, when all the gambling dens were completely closed, he was also eliminated. When Yun was protecting gambling dens, he had two close companions named Ma Pi Fa and Fang Xiaomao, who spent their days together. However, a few weeks ago, Yun suddenly had a quarrel with Ma Pi and Fang, which then turned into a physical fight. Initially, Fang Xiaomao was beaten up once by Yun, who had gathered a group of people. Fang then held a grudge and called upon Ma Pi and others every day to search for Yun everywhere to seek revenge, but they did not encounter him for several days. Later, Fang learned that Yun was currently hiding in the home of Fan Asi at No. 6 Yuqingfang, Maide'an Road, in the French Concession, smoking opium. Yesterday morning at 11:30, he gathered six or seven people, including Ma Pi Fa, and went straight to Yuqingfang to wait. At that time, Yun was just walking out of No. 4, intending to go to No. 6 to smoke opium. As soon as he approached the entrance of No. 7, Fang and others rushed forward, each using pistols and axes to wildly chop at Yun's body, firing two shots. One bullet pierced Yun's right thigh, causing him to immediately fall to the ground, bleeding profusely. A total of six axes struck his legs, and one axe struck each of his hands, breaking his foot bones. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the assailants fled the alley and disappeared without a trace. Someone reported it to the Great Bell Police Station, and the head constable immediately dispatched detectives to investigate. He also ordered Chinese Constable No. 323 to send Yun to Renji Hospital. According to the doctor, the injuries were very severe, and even if his life was spared, it would take more than two months to recover.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing to you because the "News" column of your esteemed newspaper today contains a report entitled "Delivery Note Packages Not Affixed with Stamps." Although this notice was issued by the Transportation Department, it is unknown on what basis it was issued. Upon investigation, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways have not issued any regulations recently (the Transportation Department's notice is based on the regulations of March 28, which contains a major misunderstanding). Our Bureau specializes in handling stamp duties for delivery notes and has not received any explicit orders from superiors to waive the affixing of stamps, nor has there been any official document canceling our Bureau. We have already submitted a request to the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau to await instructions. This matter concerns the future of tax revenue and must be urgently corrected to avoid misunderstandings. I hope you will publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to maintain our friendship.</p>
<p>With best wishes,</p>

<h3>The Successes and Failures of the Chinese Expedition Football Team in Batavia</h3>
<p>Great Victory Over Batavia... Five to One</p>
<p>Crushing Defeat by Batavia Combined... Two to Six</p>
<p>| Li Huitang, Li Ning, and others Injured Again | Chen Yutian Rushed from Shanghai |</p>
<p>(July 27th, Batavia Dispatch) After the Chinese Expedition Football Team went to Java from Singapore, they competed twice in Bandung. On the 23rd, they played against the Bandung Selection Team, resulting in a 1-1 draw. On the 24th, they played against the Uni Team, resulting in a 0-1 loss for China. After the Chinese team returned to Batavia, they had two games at Ligapala on the 26th and 27th. The first was a contest with the Batavia team, which resulted in a 5-1 victory for China. The second day was the final against the Batavia Selection, which ended in a 2-6 defeat. The battle conditions of the two days are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Great Victory Over Batavia</h3>
<p>Five to One</p>
<p>At 4:45 PM on Saturday the 26th, the Chinese and Batavia teams entered the field one after the other and took their positions. After the referee blew the whistle to announce the start of the game, our Consul General performed the opening kick ceremony. The result of the game was a 5-1 victory for China.</p>
<h3>Four to One in the First Half</h3>
<p>The Chinese team's forwards received the ball, and five players attacked simultaneously, coordinating well and nearly reaching the Batavia goal. The center forward passed the ball to Cao on the right wing, who then passed it to the left wing, but it was cleared by the opposing inner defender. Sun, the center back, passed it again to the right wing. The flying general charged straight at the goal alone, causing panic among the opposing inner defenders, who mistakenly touched the ball, resulting in a penalty kick. The center forward, Dai, took the kick. As the whistle blew, the ball rolled into the corner of the goal. Before long, in the next play, the Batavia team tried to retaliate, and their five forwards attacked bravely. Fortunately, the Chinese team's inner defenders defended powerfully, and they were unable to succeed. At this time, they attacked and we defended, advancing and retreating. After about ten minutes of battle, the Batavia right wing seized the ball and dribbled it straight up, kicking it towards the Chinese goal. Zhou, the goalkeeper, tackled the ball, causing it to hit the ground. The ball was about to enter the goal, but it was hooked out of bounds by the inner defender. A corner kick was awarded; otherwise, this goal would have been scored. After a while, the Batavia forwards seized the ball again, passing it to each other and heading straight into the Chinese inner defense. With lightning speed, they kicked the ball into the Chinese goal. Ten minutes later, Cao, the right wing, received a ball passed from the center back and dribbled it straight up, nearly reaching the opposing goal before passing it to Dai, the center forward. Dai kicked the ball, and it went into the net. This was at 5:10. Two minutes later, Dai received another ball passed from the right wing and, taking advantage of the opponent's inner weakness, broke through the Batavia goal again. Three minutes later, Chen, the left wing, seized the enemy's ball and passed it to the right wing auxiliary, Chen Jiaqiu. Chen, the right wing auxiliary, sent it into the enemy's goal with a header. At halftime, the Chinese team had a 4-1 lead.</p>
<h3>One to Zero in the Second Half</h3>
<p>After the break, Liang Rongde replaced Chen Zhenhe as the left center back, and Chen, the right wing auxiliary, was changed to right wing, and Cao, the right wing, was changed to right wing auxiliary. After a while, the inner defender Li was injured and fell to the ground, and Li Huitang took his place. Liang Rongde became the left wing auxiliary, and the reserve player Fu Xiangqing became the left center back. Both sides fought until 6 o'clock without any gains or losses. At 6:03, the center forward Dai received a ball from Chen, the left wing, and attacked the opponent's goal again, scoring another goal. When the whistle blew to end the game, the Chinese team defeated Batavia by a score of 5-1. On this day, the winner received a trophy jointly presented by Lin Shuiqing and Chen Fuding, as well as trophies from the Silawaharora and Wuliayan factories. The losers received a silver medal from the Xu Li Company. The total ticket revenue for the day was over 9,000 guilders.</p>
<h3>(Two) Crushing Defeat by Batavia Combined</h3>
<p>Two to Six</p>
<p>On Sunday, the 27th, the Chinese team played the final against the Batavia Selection Team in the afternoon. The audience was larger than on the first day, with ticket revenues reaching over 10,000 guilders, as it was expected that today's match would be more spectacular. However, because many of the Chinese team's players had sore feet and the reinforcements had not yet arrived, although Mr. Chen Yutian had accepted the invitation to come south to take a position at a certain insurance company, he had not practiced for a long time and might not be able to join the team. Those in the know had long predicted that it would be difficult to win, but they never expected that they would lose so badly by a score of 2-6.</p>
<h3>Center Back Sun Retaliates with a Goal</h3>
<p>At 4:30, Mr. Hong Yuanyuan first presented a cigarette factory trophy that had not been prepared and presented the previous day. Then, Provincial Assembly Member Yang Hengjian performed the opening kick ceremony. The selected team took the offensive from the start. In less than five minutes, the Chinese team was scored upon. However, four minutes later, the five Chinese forwards coordinated their passes and attacked the opponent's goal. Suddenly, they were repelled. The ball was received by center back Sun. The opponent was unable to defend in time, and he retaliated with a goal.</p>
<h3>Injured Soldiers and a Disordered Battle Line</h3>
<p>By 4:50, the Chinese team's inner defense was weak, and the opponent took the opportunity to score another goal. Before long, inner defender Li Ning was injured and fell to the ground. At this time, the Chinese team's line-up changed greatly again. Because Li Ning was injured and left the field, Li Huitang had already been reassigned to left inner defender, Fu Xiangqing replaced Liang Rongde as center back, and Liang was changed to left wing auxiliary. At 5:10, the selected team's forward dribbled the ball straight in and, taking advantage of the fact that Li Huitang was standing in front of goalkeeper Zhou and could not block him, kicked in another goal. At halftime, the selected team had a 3-1 lead.</p>
<h3>The Situation is Dire, and There is No Way to Recover</h3>
<p>After the lemon quenched their thirst, they fought again. Although their desire for revenge was strong, there were few opportunities. At 5:30 and 5:45, the opponent scored two consecutive goals. At this point, Li Huitang returned to his original position. At 5:49, he kicked in a goal against the opponent. However, three minutes later, the opponent scored another goal. When the game stopped, the Chinese team lost by a score of 2-6. The Tiansheng Daily, Jingbao, and Angosmi trophies were all won by the Batavia Selection Team, while the silver medal from Xu Li Company was won by the defeated Chinese team.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of developing Mongolian-Tibetan education, a resolution was passed at the Third Plenary Session and the Second National Education Conference to promote concrete plans for Mongolian-Tibetan education. Based on this resolution, the Ministry of Education decided to establish Mongolian-Tibetan schools in Nanjing and Kangding to quickly train talents urgently needed for the development of Mongolia and Tibet and to provide teachers for local education.

Yesterday, the Commission responded to the Executive Yuan for approval. The organizational outlines for the two schools are recorded as follows:</p>

The Ministry of Education issued the following reply: It is known that the qualifications of graduates of the old system of middle school are equivalent to those who have completed one year of study in senior high school. Those who wish to continue their education must pass an entrance examination and be inserted into the second year of senior high school. Regarding the claim in the petition that graduates of the old system of normal school who have served for more than two years are allowed to study at the College of Education of a university, the Ministry has no such explicit order. Let it be known.</p>

<h3>New News from the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center</h3>

<h3>The Success of the Chinese Language Textbook for Senior High School from the World Bookstore</h3>
<p>The textbooks for junior and senior high school published by the World Bookstore have become popular throughout the country for a time, and the education community has unanimously praised them. In particular, the Chinese language textbook for senior high school from the Bureau is recognized by the world as an unprecedented creation. The reason is that Chinese language teaching has become the most important issue in recent years. One reason is the lack of good textbooks, and the second is the lack of effective teaching methods. The two are mutually causal. Now, the Chinese language textbook for senior high school from the World Bookstore completely applies scientific methods to edit and identify literary styles, study the relationship between literature and the times, and literary principles as the three major focuses of Chinese language research. It is compiled into a very organized textbook, consisting of three volumes divided into six books. The first volume, upper and lower, is for the study of literary styles; the second volume, upper and lower, is for literary history; and the third volume, upper and lower, is for literary theory. The three volumes are consistently connected but can also be independent of each other. As for the level, it is gradual, and the goal is from near to far. The annotations are simple and appropriate, and both literary words and thoughts are emphasized. They are all carefully considered, which has opened up a new path for Chinese language teaching. Now, dozens or hundreds of schools in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and other places have scheduled to adopt the book as a textbook. It is heard that in addition to using high-quality wood-free paper for printing, the Bureau is now planning to print another edition on Swedish paper with even lower prices to provide for self-study and seek popularization.</p>
<h3>Wang Buxian's Bestselling English Conversation and Letter Writing Model</h3>
<p>The two books, "English Conversation Model" and "English Letter Writing Model," written by English writing expert Mr. Wang Buxian and published by the Commercial Press, have been adopted by many middle schools in various provinces and cities. The "Conversation Model" is divided into 41 chapters, listing all the sentences needed inside and outside the school, in commercial communication, meetings, speeches, discussions, and daily life. They are printed side by side with extremely fluent vernacular translations, making it easier for scholars to understand. It is truly the newest and most unique conversation reader. The "Letter Writing Model" has 25 chapters, detailing the methods and regulations for writing various letters in social, commercial, and administrative settings. In addition to listing sample articles, it also provides a variety of information for scholars to use. The Chinese annotations at the end of each chapter are particularly complete.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Daughter: Mom, please put more vinegar in this fried noodles, I like the sour taste the most.</p>
<p>Mother: Child, vinegar hinders development. You can't eat too much, or you won't grow up and will always be like a child.</p>
<p>Daughter: Then I can ride the tram for free for the rest of my life and save on clothing material when making clothes. Isn't that good?</p>
<p>Husband: I plan to dismiss the cook and have you cook the meals.</p>
<p>Wife: Didn't you previously complain that I didn't cook well?</p>
<p>Husband: But a good cook cooks too well.</p>
<p>Wife: What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>Husband: The doctor said I've been eating too much and have already planted the seeds of a stomach disease. If you cook, I can eat less.</p>
<p>Pastor: Mr. Wang, why haven't you been coming to my church lately?</p>
<p>Mr. Wang: Because your church causes me unpleasant feelings in three ways. First, I get sleepy listening to your sermons. Second, the sound of the hymns annoys me. Third, I first met my wife while attending church in your church, and later we also got married there.</p>
<h3>Jiong Yuan Random Notes</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Liu Wende, an old man from Jilin, grew two horns on his head. The Japanese hired him at an annual salary of ten thousand gold to go to Japan for biological research. I think, perhaps his father or grandfather, or even himself, was a specialist in producing and selling deer antlers. They raised a deer, hoping every day for its antlers to grow, diligently seeking profit. His mother or wife served as a provider of fodder, treating the deer like a deity. As a result, thoughts solidified into form, leading to this outcome. I have seen a friend who studied Buddhism. After more than ten years, his earlobes drooped like Buddhist beads. After more than thirty years, a round mark appeared on his forehead and between his eyebrows, like the image of the Buddha in paintings. However, my friend Wang Ernan, who does not need to be an old man, is seventy-nine years old this year, and his ears and forehead are already like the above. As for the Buddha-image, only his two ears are so far. As for what is recorded in past records that transformations into objects are mostly near delusional. Therefore, the Ma Yi school often says that appearances follow the mind; this is indeed because they have seen many people. In the past, there was a friend named Guan Hanqing who admired Guan Yu's character since childhood, so his eyebrows and eyes were like the portrait, except without a beard. Wang Er Ma, a performer in Shanghai, who is used to playing Guan Gong, looks absolutely like him on stage. And Xia Yuerun also plays Guan Gong often, so he has some resemblance. As for Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Xun Huisheng, and Shang Xiaoyun, who specialize in cross-dressing, their words and actions become feminine, which is enough to support the saying that appearances follow the mind. I suspect Liu Wende being a deer antler merchant is just an ideal, but it can also be tested on ordinary people to see if it is possible. For example, extend your right arm, stare at a small raised piece of flesh on the arm, and think with all your heart that this flesh can bulge up like a ball. Then, focus your mind, concentrate your attention, and stare without blinking. This flesh will gradually rise and become higher. All kinds of diseases are created by the mind, and a mind like Yao or Jie will appear on the face, which is exactly the same principle.</p>
<h3>Detailed Records of the Hua Dong University Summer Conference (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xiao Meng</p>
<p>Vegetarianism: Putuo is a sea island managed by monks. All the residents of the island are vegetarian. Even canned meat dishes are not available. Generally, those who love meat have a state of mind of not eating without meat. The Youth Association officials shipped canned food from Shanghai to Putuo, but they were exhausted in a few days. After the canned food was gone, the amount of food also decreased greatly. Some admired the beautiful scenery of Putuo and wanted to become monks, but at this point, they dispelled this idea. When returning to Shanghai, they were like hungry people who didn't pick their food. The Ningbo dishes prepared in the ship's steerage were all scrambled for a taste.</p>
<p>Sightseeing: The people in the conference always take an afternoon tour every day, divided into teams. The organized teams often take schools as units. Someone from a certain school came to the conference with only one person, which was very boring. It is necessary to temporarily break the closed-door policy. When the group was touring, they saw watermelons and picked them to eat. Some exchanged a silver dollar for six watermelons and four cantaloupes. They were sweet and fresh, and the skin could be removed with fingers. It was really rare. A certain student was walking halfway and saw a statue of Buddha, so he sat next to it and put his hat on the Buddha's head to take a picture together. The monks were not angry at first and stood by and laughed. Later, when they saw four or five pilgrims passing by without throwing a penny, they became angry, so the student said, "Sir, please understand yourself, we rely on him for food." The teams mostly rode bicycles for sightseeing. The sedan carriers in the temple put the title of "extremely rude" on the members, but because of the large number of people, they were not afraid of them.</p>
<p>Lawyer: Among the members, there is a famous lawyer from Shanghai, Mr. So-and-so, whose eloquent speeches are quite admired by his colleagues. In his free time, he often gathers a dozen people to discuss "criminals" and "laws" as a pleasure. The number of people freely joining this group increased day by day. The closest to him were the students from Shanghai University. This lawyer has been away from school life for many years and is busy in society all day long. He can actually split himself up and join this group as a student. It is really a strange thing. At first, some wanted to ask him various questions, but they were afraid that he would ask for consultation fees after returning to Shanghai, so they hesitated. It was not until a few days later that they realized it was all overthinking.</p>
<p>Farewell: On the last day of the conference, the members exchanged addresses and took many group photos. Some wanted to extend the conference period. When parting, the sound of "See you again someday" was endless, just like "Hope to see you again."</p>
<p>This conference leaders have sacrificed a lot of time and money. General students have benefited from physical, mental, intellectual and social benefit, which is the efforts of the summer conference preparatory committee.</p>
<h3>Xiao Chang Xin News</h3>
<p>— Qiu Xu</p>
<p>The mountains and peaks of Changshan Yushan area of ​​Zhejiang are high and rugged, and the ports and forks are vertical and horizontal. It takes about half a month by boat from Changshan to Hangzhou, so travelers feel quite inconvenient. The railway authorities have seen this and discussed the construction of a branch road named Xiao Chang (Xiaoshan to Changshan) light railway. The journey is about 700 miles long, and the rails are laid along the foothills to avoid occupying farmland. However, the whole road project is quite large, so it is planned to build the Xiao Zhu (Xiaoshan to Zhuji) section first. It is heard that this section is now under active construction and is expected to be completed by next spring and open to traffic first. It is said that the locomotives needed are the ones currently running on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. New locomotives have also been ordered from Germany for the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Once the new locomotives arrive, they can be installed separately. It is also heard that Minister Sun of the Ministry of Railways personally visited the engineering office of the section last month to inspect everything and was very satisfied. In the future, when the entire road is completed and opened to traffic, Hangzhou and Changshan can be reached in one day, which is much more convenient than traveling by boat.</p>
<h3>Recording Zhang Huichong's Magic</h3>
<p>— Shen Ying</p>
<p>Movie star Zhang Huichong has long been studying magic. Five or six years ago, he showed his skills at the Carlton Theater. This spring, he was again invited by the Central Grand Theater to perform magic on stage for half an hour along with the Yellow Sea Pirate film he starred in. His quick and magical transformations were praised by those who saw him. Recently, the foreign magician Nie Geladi came to Shanghai, calling himself the King of Magic and saying that his large repertoire could not be performed by other magicians. Zhang Jun thought that his words were too arrogant and despised Chinese people. Therefore, last month, he publicly performed the magic that Nie claimed that others could not perform for the Chinese people at the Central Grand Theater. Such as Nie's performance of "Crushing Women", "Waist Chop Beauty" and Silk Scarf Illusion and other programs are extremely wonderful and won the welcome of the audience. Zhang Jun's trial performance was successful. Now, starting from August 14th, he has been invited by the Xia Ling Peck Theater to perform formally for Chinese and foreign audiences. It is heard that his performance programs include the "Water Escape" and "Thousand Stone" programs that Zhang Jun recently invented, in addition to melting and performing the magic of Nie Gelakade and other schools.</p>
<h3>Supplement to Anecdotes of Mr. Sheng Xingchuan</h3>
<p>— Qing Song Jushi</p>
<p>Unchanged Scholarly Style: The folk customs of Ningdu, Jiangxi Province are fierce and the scholar spirit is rampant. There are Zhao and Wu two Mingjings who are cunning and good at writing. They wear tiger hats and combine with officials to arbitrarily make decisions in the countryside, and the roads are viewed with caution. There is a woman named Quan, whose surname is Liang and married Hong Junsheng in the same village. The lady is newly widowed and naturally beautiful. Zhao and Wu have coveted it for a long time. One day, they saw that the parents-in-law were out, so they broke in and violated it. The woman suffered this humiliation and wanted to die. The father-in-law knew the truth and complained to the magistrate. The magistrate was greedy and confused. Zhao and Wu offered a thousand gold to frame the woman for having a mulberry tryst and accused the father-in-law of suing and placed him in prison, while the two were free from the law. At that time, Mr. Sheng Xingchuan visited Ningdu, and heard about the incident and secretly visited to find out the truth. He summoned the magistrate and rebuked him, saying, "You covet gold and ruin your integrity. How can this be human? I am a Fengxian official and have the duty to maintain customs and redress grievances. Bind Zhao and Wu for me." The magistrate complied and bound them. Mr. Sheng slapped the table and shouted, "You rely on the magic power of money to forcibly violate the chaste woman of a family, coerce the magistrate to reverse the truth and turn it into a wrong. This court has long known that you are colluding with each other and doing all kinds of evil. You are truly beasts in clothing. What do you have to say?" The two knew it was difficult to escape punishment, and they confessed the truth to the court, released the father-in-law from prison, and put the two to justice and impeached the Ningdu magistrate from office. At that time, those who heard it were happy and praised Sheng Qingtian, and the scholarly style of Ningdu was respected.</p>
<p>Caring for the Poor After Relief: There was a man named Liu, who was a fellow villager of Mr. Sheng and had a close relationship. When Mr. Sheng passed the imperial examination, Liu was assigned to the Luojiang County of Sichuan Province. As a scholar, he was not good at flattering the magistrate and remained honest and upright throughout his life. After his death, he was poor and owed a thousand gold to the government. The superiors urged him to pay it back as soon as possible, and the coffin was stopped in the wilderness, and there was no way to return to his hometown. His wife and children cried sadly. Mr. Sheng was presiding over the examination in Sichuan and felt unbearable pain for the coldness of human relations. He asked the superiors to voluntarily compensate and persuaded scholars and people to help him. At that time, three hundred gold were collected from the wheat boat. Liu's family was able to transport the coffin back. Mr. Sheng gave another two hundred gold to manage his family. Both the living and the dead felt the Yin virtue. It is not luck that he reached the age of ancient times and reached old age. It is appropriate.</p>
<h3>New Knowledge of the Family</h3>
<p>— Edited by Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Homemade fruit dew wine or ice jelly or cool rice cakes and fruit soup. Using Invincible brand fruit dew, it is all beautiful and extraordinary. Using almond dew to make almond cheese is even more beautiful. Adding almond dew to milk or soy milk can resolve phlegm, relieve coughs, heal the lungs, and moisten the intestines. The effect is very obvious. Drinking this in autumn is more effective than medicine for preventing coughs and dysentery. Lemon dew is suitable for summer. It clears away heat, relieves heat, can cure stomach pain, and prevents epidemics, cholera, and prickly heat. It is much safer than cold food sold in the market. If you want to be cool, mix it with ice water. The taste is the same as Dutch water. It is a pity that the glass bottle is too big and the postage is inconvenient, which makes people far away sigh. (Fang Chengde)</p>
<p>Xu's Note: The fruit dew can be concentrated to ten times or even a hundred times, but the amount used is not appropriate, so it is often unsatisfactory. Therefore, it is not produced and sold. If you want to use this as a business item in a distant port, please contact us by letter, and we will have a way. The approximate cost is 500 yuan, and you can get about 25% profit, and you can also produce and sell white rose wine, which is made with local shochu and fragrance. The price of each jin of fragrance is only 1.2 cents. If you want to try it out, just send 5 yuan in postage stamps to the agency, and we will send you various types and their preparation methods for trial production.</p>
<p>There are many ways to make ice cream. Some contain too much water, which leads to the formation of ice flowers that are sandy. Some contain too much powder, which is as hard as a cake and unpleasant. Some contain too much milk and soften like cream. All of these are shortcomings. The best ice cream in Shanghai was formerly made by Huitong on Nanjing Road. It was fat and beautiful like butter from the borderlands. It is a pity that the cost was too high, so the price was high and the diners gradually thinned out. I made it myself in its style. The finished product is excellent. Twelve eggs a month. First, beat the egg whites into a froth. Then, beat the egg yolks in another container, add three pounds of fresh milk and one pound of fruit dew and mix them thoroughly. Then, gradually add one pound of six-grain flour and mix it into a slurry to ensure that there are no particles. If there are particles, they should be fished out, dissolved in cold water, and mixed in again. Then, combine it with the egg white froth and put it in a shaking bucket. Surround the bucket with crushed ice and add salt. For every ten pounds of ice, two pounds of salt should be added so that the ice melts easily and gets very cold. Shake for only thirty minutes and it is done. Do not open the lid temporarily. Cover the top of the bucket with a damp cloth so that it can be stored for a long time. The product thus produced is enough for twelve people to eat and have plenty left over. The cost is only 1.5 yuan. The banana dew of the Invincible brand is the best for the fruit dew used. Each dozen pounds only costs 2.4 yuan, which is much cheaper and more beautiful than using fruit juice and sugar. If you want it to form sand and ice chips, add two pounds of cold water when mixing, so that it contains more water. (Ri Zhi)</p>
<h3>Dance Knowledge (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Bu Wu Zhi He</p>
<p>(1) If a female guest does not want to dance for any reason, she must have a reasonable excuse, such as being unwell or feeling tired, and must express deep apologies. However, after this statement, she must not dance with other male guests. (1) Tea dance should be waited until after tea snacks are served, and meal dance should be waited until after soup and fish are served. (1) When leading a female guest for the first time, you must see how good at dancing she is. If she is very good at dancing, you can gently touch her shoulder and use your arm movements to guide her. In this way, the chest can be separated and the demeanor is elegant. However, if you encounter a clumsy dancer, it is still better to hug her tightly to avoid tripping and bumping toes due to being too polite, leading to falling and losing your composure. (1) When dancing in hot weather, pay attention to sweaty hands getting the female guest's clothes dirty (especially those wearing evening dresses). It is best to lightly touch the back of the index finger and wrist of the dance partner, and loosen your hands from time to time to avoid raising the clothes. Be sure to avoid holding the whole palm tightly. It is best to wear gloves. (1) In hot weather, you must pay attention to your appearance. If you are sweating, your veins are bulging, your face is red, and you are panting, you should rest, tidy up your appearance, and wipe away sweat. You should not be rude or use paper to fan yourself, etc. (1) When the music stops, you should stop lightly and pat her hand, listen to the music and continue playing, and then dance again. If the dance partner shows signs of fatigue at the end of the first song, you should stop. However, you cannot stop dancing before the music stops, otherwise it will inevitably attract attention. (1) When dancing with a female guest who is not very familiar, you should not dance a too lively step that is difficult for the other party to cope with and feel sorry for themselves, thus making them unhappy. (1) You should not refuse to dance if you have been requested by a female guest to dance. If there are special reasons, you must also set up a word of tactful refusal. (1) You should always check yourself in terms of manners, and apologize if you feel that you have been negligent. (1) If you are not familiar with slightly complicated dances such as Polonaise or Tango, you should refrain from dancing when the music starts, or if you can dance but dance with a female guest who is not familiar with this kind of dance, it is easy to cause improper etiquette, so you must pay attention. (1) It is easy to attract attention when there are occasional inappropriate things in social situations, but you must deal with them calmly and calmly to quell the public's ridicule. Do not be cramped and ashamed, which will only lead to publicity and become uncontrollable. (1) No matter what kind of dance posture, it should be beautiful. For example, when dancing Foxtrot, it should be lively and brisk, Polonaise should be natural and lazy, Waltz should be beautiful and gentle, Tango should be charming and gentle. Avoid hunching back, snake waist, crooked head, bent hands, shaking shoulders, restraining legs and other ugly attitudes. When dancing, words must be respectful and polite. Avoid being humble and rude. (1) When attending a dance party, you must not be full of sorrow and make the whole seat unhappy. You should try to make a happy face and cheer up. Otherwise, you can refuse to come so that others will not be unhappy because of you. (Appendix) At tea parties, female guests are mostly responsible for serving tea, adding sugar, pouring milk, and serving snacks. Men are responsible for serving tea, coffee, or fruit juice after meals. If alcohol is served, sweet wine is appropriate. If the dance partner is beautiful, serving mint wine, peach cheeks and willow eyebrows will reflect each other, and the red lights and green wine are enough to intoxicate without drinking. If men want to drink, they can only drink beer or stronger alcoholic drinks to show the outline of their beard. If you don't want to drink, you can order ginger beer or ginger ale. Otherwise, ordering a cup of milk is equal to being in a nursery.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (2) (5) (2)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Episode 13: Who Plants Fortune and Unintentionally Obtains a Diamond Ring? Only This Karma Sings a Gold Thread</p>
<p>At that moment, Zuo Shichen suddenly encountered a frustrating and frustrating thing. What do you say it is? It turned out that his beloved son died. This child of his was three years old according to the Chinese way of calculating age. According to the foreign way of calculating, it was less than three years old, only twenty-six months old. He was already learning to speak. This child had a smart face, but he unexpectedly contracted a sudden infantile convulsion, and the onset was at twelve o'clock at night. He was caught off guard. However, Zuo Shichen believed in Western medicine. Near where he lived was a hospital opened by a Western church, and there was a female doctor who was famous for specializing in pediatrics. The quickest way was to immediately knock on the door of that hospital and ask that female doctor to come for a consultation. At that time, there was only a maid and a carriage driver in Zuo Shichen's house. Because he thought it would be difficult for the carriage driver to explain clearly, he decided to go himself. He simply left the carriage driver at home and hired a streetcar to come to the hospital and knocked on the door for a long time. The gatekeeper of the hospital finally asked with a sleepy and hazy tone, "Who is it?" Zuo Shichen said, "Please see the doctor, thank you for opening the door." The gatekeeper said with lingering anger, "Please see the doctor? What doctor do you want to see in the middle of the night? Can't you ask a doctor to come during the day tomorrow?" Zuo Shichen felt a little angry in his heart when he heard his words. He thought that the arrival of disease is not like many regular people. It does not patronize people at night. Disease is an evil demon that does not know the time. It comes whenever it wants to. The duty of a doctor is to defeat the evil demon of disease. When encountering an emergency, the doctor should set off at any time, regardless of night or day. Treating an emergency is like putting out a fire. How can you slowly wait until tomorrow? Moreover, the family's hope for a doctor is like a living Bodhisattva saving lives. When Zuo Shichen went out, his wife was holding the sick child in her arms, her eyes filled with tears. She repeatedly said, "Can you ask that doctor to come right away? Promise him whatever medical expenses he wants." It was as if the doctor's hand touched the child's head and the illness would disappear immediately. It was just that he encountered such a gatekeeper when he knocked on the hospital door. Zuo Shichen thought that the child was probably difficult to save. The first hurdle was unlucky. But he still begged him to open the door. He thought that the gatekeeper only knew the gatekeeper's duties, and it would be useless to say anything to him. If he agreed to open the door, he could talk to the hospital official, or if he was lucky, he could talk to the doctor directly. How could he know that the doctor would not be willing to come when he saw my urgent request?</p>

<p>The Silver Dollar Market Was Slightly Better at the Beginning of the Week</p>
<h3>Market Overview</h3>
<p>The business situation in the financial sector is inherently dull during the late summer and early autumn. Therefore, the daily situation is unusually quiet. The buying and selling of foreign funds and the slow digestion of goods, as well as the supply and demand of silver funds, are not significant. As a result, the amount of collections and settlements is becoming increasingly scarce, and even interbank lending transactions have been interrupted. However, yesterday was Monday, and the market atmosphere was slightly better than usual. Bank collections and settlements were also quite prosperous, but the digestion of foreign funds remained sluggish.</p>
<h3>Interest Rate for Short-Term Loans</h3>
<p>(Foreign Interest Rate) The morning market was at 7 qian, 2 fen, 9 li, 1 hao and 2 hu and a half. The noon market was at 7 qian, 2 fen, 9 li, 3 hao and 7 hu and a half. The result seemed to be 3 hao and 7 hu and a half higher than the market price of the previous day. However, due to the small amount of sales, there was ultimately no possibility of rising. It may also be that it is hovering and unable to make any significant changes. (Silver Interest Rate) The loose and excessive silver supply has reached its extreme in recent days. Every day, it is either 2 fen or a free loan. Although the morning market silver interest rate opened at 2 fen yesterday, the noon market was still a free loan. There was no market for negotiated rates, let alone silver listings.</p>
<h3>Subsidiary Coin Market Situation</h3>
<p>Jiangnan small silver dollars remained firm. The morning market was at 6 qian, 4 fen and 3 li. The noon market was at 6 qian, 4 fen and 2 li. The result was comparable to the noon market of the previous day. The transaction volume was 4,000 jiao in the morning market and 2,000 jiao in the noon market. The Guangdong small silver dollars were at 6 qian, 1 fen, 5 li and 7 hao and a half in the morning market and 6 qian, 1 fen, 6 li and 7 hao and a half in the noon market. The fluctuations between the two markets were 1 li, and it was 1 li and 2 hao and a half higher than the morning market of the previous day. The transaction volume was 85,000 jiao in the morning market and 90,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins remained at 391,000 wen.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow</h3>

Chinese banks collected and settled over 300,000 yuan of drafts, foreign banks collected and settled over 2.3 to 2.4 million yuan of drafts, special drafts were over 1.3 million yuan, advances were 1 million yuan, and various freight, tax and miscellaneous collections and settlements were over 1.1 million yuan.

<h3>Records of the Desolate Financial Scene</h3>
<p>The financial industry in Shanghai is currently slightly calm. It is generally expected that it will be prosperous in the autumn. However, trade with other ports is becoming increasingly sluggish. Since the major stimulus in the Guangzhou market, it has inevitably declined. The Hubei businesses have also been affected in the same way, and they have generally reduced lending, even refusing to do much. If cash needs to be shipped, the cash must be remitted by telegraphic transfer before it can be shipped. Otherwise, it may take many days of waiting. It is also heard that the Jiangxi businesses have also been affected by the military situation, and the transportation of goods and remittances has been temporarily suspended. This autumn, various goods will not be handled as usual. In addition, land transportation in the northern routes is blocked, and goods are stagnant. The provinces of Henan and Hunan are even more desolate after the disasters, and it will take time for post-disaster recovery. However, trade with overseas Chinese is still smooth, which is surprising.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Tend to be Slightly Peaceful</h3>
<p>Various prices fluctuated compared to the end of last week.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for various public bonds saw little trading. The futures market was also slightly calmer than the previous day. The trends of various bonds were also more peaceful than before. The morning market saw subdued buying interest, and prices once fell, with the downsizing, customs duties, and troop reduction bonds each falling by 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan. Afterwards, buying interest turned strong and prices rebounded. As a result, there were fluctuations compared to the end of last week. Domestic customs duties rose by 6 to 7 jiao, and the spot price of troop reduction bonds rose by as much as 2.5 yuan compared to Friday of last week. Other changes were in the range of several jiao. The total spot market transaction volume was 15,000 yuan, of which whole sixes accounted for 13,000 yuan, and the rest were extremely scarce. The futures market opened at over 5.7 million yuan in the morning and only over 2.3 million yuan in the afternoon, for a total of over 8 million yuan. Domestic customs duties and troop downsizing bonds were still good, each accounting for over 2.5 million yuan. Troop reduction bonds also accounted for over 1.9 million yuan. Whole sixes and post-disaster relief bonds each accounted for only 400,000 to 500,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn, Cotton Yarn Market Shows Slight Softness</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm and the trend is slightly soft. Since the overseas yarn and cotton market situation has fallen sharply, the bulls in the local market have become slightly less enthusiastic. Therefore, the actions of the Guangdong businesses are slightly quieter, and actual sales are not as strong as the previous day. However, the buyers' attitude remains firm. Because the standard first-class goods have been almost entirely acquired by the Guangdong businesses, although the sellers are throwing out goods, they dare not act rashly. The market atmosphere can still be maintained for a while and will not fall sharply. However, the telegraphic report from the third-grade yarn market is relatively softer.</p>
<h3>Renbiao Dachang Completes Bull Positions</h3>
<p>The Renbiao market opened in the morning with a calm atmosphere. The trading in the market was still good. Dachang completed its bull positions, and the market situation was slightly looser. All months fell by 2, 3, or 4 qian. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere was slightly firmer, with the bulls pulling tight and not letting go. All months rose by 1, 2, or 3 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 9,250 bales. It was found that Yiyu sold 1,450 bales, Dachang sold 1,100 bales, and Yuda, Maoji, Chongyu, and Yichang sold 350 to 550 bales. Dafu bought 950 bales, and Gengfeng, Shenchang, Tiancheng, Changfeng, Yongchang, and Dafeng bought 350 to 450 bales. The Renbiao closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Renbiao Closing Prices, Increase/Decrease, Open Account Balance, November 1588, Down 23, 12,000</p>
<p>August 1588, Down 11, 73,500, December 1587, 32,000</p>
<p>September 1588, 22, 51,000, January 1586, 32,600</p>
<p>October 1589, 23,8050</p>
<h3>Guang Businesses' Intake of Spot Yarn Has Turned Weak</h3>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are relatively clear. The statistics for the day show that all businesses bought a total of 896 bales, of which 210 bales were taken in by other businesses in the trade. The market is slightly weak. Among the outside businesses, the Guangdong businesses bought the most, at 365 bales. In addition, Niuzhuang took in 40 bales, Xuzhou took in 195 bales, Shantou took in 130 bales, inland took in 30 bales, Yunnan took in 35 bales, Wuhu took in 40 bales, Sichuan took in 35 bales, and miscellaneous businesses took in 26 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market in a Slack Situation</h3>
<p>The cotton market is flat and weak, and the overall situation is mediocre. Due to the sharp fall and slight rise in US cotton and the recent good weather, the production of new cotton in Hankou and Tongzhou is smooth. Therefore, some Hubei businesses are selling short. Buyers see the environment as unfavorable and dare not raise prices sharply. However, the Ningbo businesses are still increasing their positions. Manufacturers have a calm attitude because their inventory of old cotton is thick and there is enough for immediate use, so there is no need to purchase. The same is true for Japanese factories. The future of the cotton market is still difficult to be optimistic about and must depend on US cotton for changes.</p>
<h3>Han Standard Slightly Released</h3>
<p>The Han Standard market opened in the morning with most people thinking that US cotton had fallen sharply and risen slightly, and that the bulls were closing out their positions. All months fell by 1 qian and a half. In the afternoon, the Ningbo businesses bought in and rose by 5 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 40,800 dan. It was found that the Hubei businesses Shenchang sold 5,400 dan, Maoji sold 4,000 dan, Tianchang sold 2,300 dan, and Changji, Yongfeng, Dafeng, Yiyu, Xiesheng, Gongtai, and Jinfeng sold 1,200 to 1,800 dan. The Ningbo businesses bought 2,700 dan, Dapincheng bought 3,000 dan, and Shenfa, Dazi, Taixing, Yichang, Yongchang, Yuanda, and Daji bought 1,000 to 1,500 dan. The Han Standard closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>October 3345, 8,74,000, January 3445, 55, 21,000</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Trading Extremely Calm</h3>
<p>Spot cotton business is dull. The source is Yaohua 800 bales.</p>
<p>Shaanxi cotton 3685, Hongzhang Factory took in 100 pieces of spot goods for delivery to the factory.</p>
<p>Yaohua 3460, Weitong Factory took in 100 bales and delivered them at the pier.</p>
<h3>Tong Cotton Crop Situation Still Good</h3>
<p>The situation of the cotton crop in Nantong is extremely good, and the boll formation is also good. However, the area along the river has suffered some losses due to the sudden rise in the tide. The cotton crops of Tonghai Reclamation, Dayu, and Dayou Jin, which are under the Yantian Reclamation Company, are growing well. The companies in Yanfu are slightly inferior. If the weather is suitable in the future, it is still possible to have a moderate harvest.</p>

<h3>Food: Domestic Customs Foreign Rice Sales Active, Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was quite active because the demand from the inland businesses was very good. The Hubei businesses also had a small amount of demand. The demand from the local streets and villages was also good. However, the traded goods were mainly domestic customs rice, and the trading of high-quality goods was mediocre. The demand for small-milled rice was the best, rising by 2 jiao alone. Other medium-quality rice all rose by 1 jiao. Although high-quality rice was also active, the market price did not follow. The total market transaction was 3,000 bags, priced at 15 yuan and a half to 14 yuan and 8 jiao. Large-milled rice was 1,000 bags, priced at 12 yuan and a half. Saigon No. 2 was 500 bags, priced at 14 yuan, 2 jiao and 3. Another No. 1 was 200 bags, priced at 16 yuan and 4 jiao. Cover rice was 300 bags, priced at 15 yuan and 2 jiao.

<h3>Flour Market Near Firm, Far Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market generally showed a hovering trend. Initially, the small report of foreign wheat made people slightly tired. Then, the manufacturers' intention to buy in the near future stimulated the market. However, in the long run, the flour sales could not rise, and the outside buyers had no intention of actively pursuing them. Therefore, the market atmosphere was flat. Judging from this situation, the near term should not be too weak due to the manufacturers' support. If the accumulation of goods in the long term becomes too large, problems will inevitably arise. As a result, the current month was 5 li better than the previous week, September was 2.5 li worse, November-December was 2.5 li worse, and January was 5 li worse.</p>
<h3>Near-Term Wheat Deficiencies, Bulls Alone Prosper</h3>
<p>Spot Goods, Factory Demand Active...Increased by 5 Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a near-firm and far-flat trend. This was because the short sellers in the current month were actively covering their positions, and there was very little high-quality goods on the market. All the goods did not meet the standards, and they may need to be taken delivery of when the opportunity arises. Therefore, people became nervous and the market turned firm again. In the long term, foreign wheat fell by a small amount of 3 to 4 jiao, and most people were still bearish, so there were few fluctuations. As a result, the current month rose by 4 fen compared to the previous week, September rose by 2 fen, and October to January remained unchanged. Spot wheat had very few high-quality goods arriving, and the source was not abundant. The demand from various factories was still active, so all grades increased by 5 fen. Wheat from Kaisashi, Jiangyan, Qitang, Yaowan, Bengbu, Guandian, Qishu, Xiping, Xinyangzhou, and Hankou, totaling over 7,000 bags, was taken away by factories such as Fuxin and Fufeng.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Factory Long Silk Exports Slightly Up</h3>
<p>Since the summer, long silk exports from silk factories have been quiet for a long time, and the market price has been sluggish. Recently, overseas silk factories have started work, and demand has gradually increased. Yesterday, there was a long silk export message from Marseille, with transactions including 30 bales of superior silk factory long silks from Xinfu, priced at 180 taels, gradually showing firmness.</p>
<h3>European and American Stockpiles, Factory Operations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in Shanghai continued to show a firm rise because European and American firms, aware that there was not much silk in overseas inventory, took the opportunity to stockpile yellow and white factory silk. However, because the price did not rise high, Chinese merchants were not willing to sell. Yesterday, only Lan Lebi and others took in 80 bales of white factory silk in Shanghai, and Dachang and others took in 50 bales of yellow factory silk, with prices all firm.</p>
<h3>Roadside Green Tea, European Sales Slightly Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, roadside green tea such as Zhenmei needle tea and Zhenmei needles had strong interest from British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Xieh, Jinlong, and Tongfu. The market price for the best needle tea has risen by 4 to 5 taels. However, the medium and low-grade goods remained unchanged. Zhenmei has an overabundance of inventory, so prices are falling rather than rising. Gongxi is becoming increasingly quiet. In recent days, Baitu has been mostly watching. Although Xiezhu has large sales, they still adhere to the principle of not buying unless the price is low. Many Chinese tea merchants are quite persistent in not selling.</p>
<h3>Italian and French Rayon Sales Smooth, Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The rayon sales season has arrived, and the producing countries such as Italy and France have been experiencing repeated natural disasters, and the source of goods has been interrupted. The demand from inland businesses is brisk, and the inventory in Shanghai is becoming increasingly thin. The market price has risen sharply. In recent days, Italian, French, British, and other firms have sold dozens of cases of rayon per day, and the transaction prices have all risen by more than 2 taels. Yihua Yangxing's Xuelong brand was 121 taels and 5 qian and 136 taels and 7 qian and a half. Kaili Yangxing's natural color opened at 133 taels and 5 qian. Kongshi Yangxing's Beauty brand was 131 taels and 2 qian and a half (all 150 denier).</p>
<h3>Paitou Yuehua Velvet, Rising Wind Extremely Strong</h3>
<p>The paitou market has been improving in recent days because the autumn sales season is approaching and the harvests are great everywhere. Therefore, everyone is optimistic and the price of goods is rising steadily. The wholesale business in the local streets is showing signs of stirring. The customers such as Ningbo, Zhenhai, and Hefei are all actively searching for goods. The Hubei and Jiangxi businesses are still watching. Although the Changsha businesses have been ravaged by the Communist Party, the goods that were sold in the past have not been returned at all. Yesterday, the Osaka price hardened again, so the market situation is very tight. The Yuehua velvet in the east has suddenly risen by 2.5 to 5 li. Daping's Tianshang has already reached 1 qian, 9 fen and a half. Zijinshan and Yang Guifei are 1 qian, 9 fen and 2 li and a half. Zhongping's Yang Guifei Qiba and Wulu are all 1 qian and 8 fen and a half. Fuhua is 1 qian and 8 fen and 7 li and a half. Black velvet is all 1 qian and 8 fen. Fine tweed continues to rise by 2.5 li. Baohua opened at 2 qian, 8 fen and 7 li and a half. Huxinting opened at 2 qian, 5 fen and 2 li and a half. Jinwengong opened at 2 qian and 5 fen. Yanghongbiao, Chongsu silk, and Hui Guangxie are all 2 fen and a half higher. Fine twill has also risen by 1 or 2 qian recently due to the strong demand from the Zhenjiang businesses. Renmian is 7 taels and 1 qian. Shuangjunren is 8 taels and 1 qian. The good Chinese three deer heads from the west have reached 10 taels and 2 qian and a half, and some have been taken away.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Glutinous Rice Branch Rebounds by 5 Taels</h3>
<p>Yuanzhi Up by a Few Taels</p>
<p>Glutinous rice branches had previously fallen to about 68 taels due to the easing of land prices. Now that it has rebounded from its extreme weakness, the rise has reached 5 taels. The current market price for medium-grade goods is over 73 taels, and the market is quite active. There may be further tightening in the future. Jinshan Yuanzhi has been priced firmly in recent days, and the goods of the upper brand have been arriving less and seeing price increases. Yesterday, the market opened at 28 taels, up about 1 tael from before. The trend of the medium and lower grades is stable as before.</p>

<h3>Passing of Mr. Xie Jiezi, Staff Member of This Newspaper</h3>
<p>Mr. Xie Jiezi, a staff member of this newspaper, passed away due to pneumonia at 10 PM on August 10th. The encoffining ceremony was held at 3 PM yesterday at his residence, No. 1789, East End of North Zhejiang Road, Hai'ning Road. The funeral procession is scheduled for 1 PM today, with temporary interment at the Xijin Guild Hall. Colleagues, upon hearing the news, have flocked to pay their respects and assist with the arrangements. Mr. Xie, a native of Dantu, was the younger brother of the renowned painter Mr. Xie Gongzhan. After graduating from school, he joined this newspaper's editorial department in 1919, serving diligently without regard for the weather, day or night. He also co-founded the Newspaper Reporters' Association with colleagues to foster camaraderie and exchange knowledge, achieving notable success. Possessing a frail constitution, he also held teaching positions at Minli Middle School and other schools, leading to a gradual weakening of his lungs and subsequent hemoptysis. Following the advice of relatives and friends, he spent over a year recuperating at Meiyuan in Wuxi, significantly restoring his health. However, he soon resumed his duties at the newspaper as before. Recently, due to the need for personnel to promote the West Lake Exposition, this newspaper requested Mr. Xie to serve as an editor. He took on all tasks, large and small, despite his physical condition, and his illness worsened as a result. Most recently, he frequently traveled under the scorching sun due to his wife, Ms. Zhang Shimin's illness, which led to a sudden and severe case of pneumonia. Although he received treatment at Baolong Hospital, medicine proved ineffective, ultimately leading to his demise. Mr. Xie was proficient in poetry and classical prose, and he published books such as "Lakeside Lianyin Grass." He passed away at the young age of thirty-three, his talents tragically unfulfilled. Alas.</p>

<h3>Medical News</h3>
<p>Dr. Chen Weiqing, a dentist at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road, is highly skilled in medicine. Whether it is tooth extraction or filling, it is no different from natural teeth. He can compassionately treat all dental diseases. Recently, the number of patients seeking treatment has increased, and the medical office has been expanded into two rooms, with the middle one serving as a waiting room filled with people. Dr. Wang Zhengting recently presented him with a plaque that reads "Just Broken, No Worries," which is hung high above. It is said that Chen's eldest son, Chen Qiujun, has inherited his father's career and is already able to practice medicine. However, his father believes that he is still too young to formally practice medicine, so he has newly opened a room for him to share the burden. It is said that Dr. Wang and his family, whenever they have dental problems, always ask Dr. Lu to treat them.</p>

<h3>Rest</h3>
<p>— Chunsen</p>
<p>By Wang Shiwei</p>
<p>In such an evil society filled with demons and monsters, how can we not cause young people to feel pain, sorrow, disappointment, and despair? All feudal relics have formed an iron fence, surrounding us, and what is presented before our eyes is nothing but ghosts and darkness. When we have not yet entered society, we are full of hope. However, after entering, the actual environment is only a fraction of what we imagined. Every day we are exposed to nothing but cold, cruel, hypocritical, and deceitful faces and tedious and rigid work. Thus, naturally, the lively, passionate spirit declines, the nerves and thoughts become numb and dull, and the pure soul is shot with the arrow of wounds. After all, it can no longer endure... endure... And on the path of life, it becomes tired and even disgusted.</p>
<p>Of course, the blame lies in the fact that young people cannot persist to the end and are frightened by the vast unknown future and cannot accept the reality of the social environment. It is impossible to escape the struggle and thoroughly transform it. But on the other hand, such a social system only makes pure young people run into walls everywhere. And because the young people's pure and innocent bodies are often unwilling to cater to the muddy current and pollute their own personality, in such a disparate situation, can we give a young person who has just left school life and entered the real society, who is very confident, a good result? Scene after scene of darkness only disgust themselves, and at the same time, how can they not think about what they should do? Can the environment allow it? They cannot struggle, they cannot struggle. What else can they do? Although everyone says that young people are full of upward will, who knows that the more they are like this, the deeper their troubles are. They seek light in their work, yes, but if they work blindly, what kind of blow should we inflict? We can say, "If this hellish society is not destroyed, the pain of mankind will not be relieved for a single day. If a reasonable and beautiful society is not successfully constructed, the happiness of mankind cannot be obtained for a single day." These words are naturally a bit too far away, but they also show the bad situation in which the young people of the era are. Therefore, while we demand that young people fully express their will to improve and advance, we must also create a new and beautiful society so that young people can develop their personality and unconsciously generate encouraging power. Therefore, if we are strict, we can explain a sentence for our young people: this is mostly the influence given by society.</p>
<p>This book "Rest" is a shout that comes from the practical life of society, an exposure of an evil society, unable to overcome all kinds of oppression, indignation, sorrow, disappointment, pain... so that one has to abandon everything and go to that quiet and clear wave to rest. The author shouted like this: "My death is not suicide, I just want to go to that clear, quiet and cold wave to rest, rest my tired spirit, adjust my withered blood, and soothe my scorched soul - when I recover my original strength, I will fight with this demon society again, I will not die." (Page 85) This rest, this symbol of fatigue in life, can it not arouse a sense of resonance and flow with deep tears of sympathy? Let us see, an extreme opponent of suicide, who recognizes himself as "one of the conscious youths, and even more unwilling to solve personal problems with death and easily abandon his mission" (Page 48), actually "remembered that I was still a strong and lively youth a year ago. I don't know why, but today, a year later, I have to throw myself, throw myself into the arms of death" (Page 84). He is so grieved, "My mother's death is of course a deep wound in my life, but it is this bloody and smelly society that sucks my blood and consumes my energy. It made me lose my schooling, made me do unwanted and cumbersome mechanical work, made my blood boil, made me go crazy, made me suffer from incurable diseases, and finally it forced me to die" (Page 85). Oh, whose misfortune is this? Whose gift is this?</p>
<p>This place contains eleven letters. When I finished reading them in one breath, I couldn't help but feel fire stirring in my heart. I was moved by the flame-like emotions. This society actually sacrificed such a young person. No, in fact, more young people were sacrificed in the same way, right?</p>
<p>He is "...repenting that he should not have studied, but should have been an ignorant and unknowing farmer, tilling and eating a few acres of thin land, serving his old mother morning and evening, and enjoying the natural scenery and the pleasures of family life. It is more carefree than studying. It is not only not expensive, but it can also be engaged in production in farming, and the family is not as debt-ridden as it is now." Therefore, the eighteen-year-old youth who had to end his school life and walk on this dark and dirty social road came with ulterior motives. As a post office clerk, although he "felt a subtle pain because this place has shown the shadow of the devil in my eyes and is smiling at me," he also "felt a kind of unprecedented joy because I thought that this was the first day to earn a meal with my own strength" (Page 7). He hoped to study and work part-time. Unexpectedly, in less than half a month, the so-called plan became a pipe dream and he experienced the unspeakable taste. "I have changed from a lively and vigorous youth into a slave to machines. Just in terms of working hours, from 7 am to 10 pm, there is almost no free time. Even eating is not free, and every meal is swallowed raw and hard, filling the stomach. After putting down the bowl and chopsticks, I have to continue this immortal work" (Page 9). He was even ridiculed by his colleagues because he was a newcomer and was treated with evil intentions of glaring and contempt everywhere, but his work was more tedious than any of his colleagues.</p>
<p>Finally, because the machine was used too violently, he vomited a large mouthful of bright red blood and suffered a near-death illness. His youthful energy disappeared. However, he was still fighting and mustered up the courage to attack, "As long as we work hard, we can get the price." Because -</p>
<p>"The mission of us young people is to use our strength to destroy all the dens of iniquity, use our blood to extinguish all the demonic fires, save the endangered motherland, and transform the dirty society. This is our only goal and responsibility" (Page 47). Unfortunately, his beloved mother passed away. The wound this gave him was that "My mother and I really depend on each other for life. She is the comforter in the depths of my spirit, the light of my life, and the sustenance of my soul. Losing such a mother who is truly worthy of being a mother, all my courage, hope, enthusiasm, and ambitions have melted away" (Page 61). Isn't that so?</p>
<p>At the same time, he also tasted the stimulation of "seeing relatives and friends as having no human feelings." His uncle, when he had just suffered the double wounds of losing his mother and a serious illness, immersed in sadness, viciously forced him to pay back the money borrowed when he returned home for his mother's funeral to achieve the purpose of annexing the family's property. And he discovered that his illness had reached a point where it could not be cured. So he shed everything and decided on his plan. He told us,</p>
<p>"I am extremely opposed to self-proclaimed conscious young people committing suicide. Suicide due to a broken heart, although it has its own meaning, is already something that we Chinese youths in this era should avoid and regard as inappropriate. As for suicide due to grief and indignation over the evils of society and the decay of the country, if it is not due to sudden madness and the intellect has not disappeared, then it is simply cowardly and incomplete and should be rejected by us. Because I believe that if we truly want to save the country and truly want to transform society, we should use our energy and blood to do some practical work in exchange for some price - but I am now a person with exhausted energy and withered blood. I really have no energy and no blood, no nothing."</p>
<p>Oh, really, "We are now in the period of youthful thought, unrestrained passion, and the pursuit of truth, beauty, and goodness. Unfortunately, we are born in this era and this society, and what we come into contact with is darkness, filth, and evil everywhere. How can we not wound our pure souls and make us feel grief, indignation, and disappointment?" As for this tragedy, what we want to respect is his cry that has come from the real life of society, although there are inevitably some places where he is self-defeating. But can we not see that his steadfast, persevering, and fearless spirit is revealed everywhere? Oh, our eighteen-year-old young warrior has been taken away by society. Is this our young people's vitality?</p>
<p>I can't help but feel full of emotion. In short, although this book is close to being pessimistic and sentimental, we can discover how much of our society's inside story there is.</p>
