<p>時評</p>
<h3>最近各國之内擾</h3>
<p>世界各國。近時國内之不安者甚多。巴西巳繼南美之玻璃維亞阿眞廷而有革命之舉動。其勢力已及於五省。。京城雖尚安靜。而暗中醖釀甚力推翻政府不過數時間事。西班牙北部之罷工。尚在進行不已。今已發生暴動。死十二人傷者極多。當地請援甚急。否則將不能維持秩序云。據各報所傳。罷工之初。並無政治關係。今則已爲極端派所利用。羅馬尼亞之内閣。已與國王意見相左而總辭職。名雖爲病。實則勢不相容。羅國或將因此而多故。德國會之召集期已近。而政府之財政談判。尚無把握。國中之鋼盔黨且有十二萬人之游行要求修改歐戰和約。並收還德國割讓之地。是其不安之情形。又可想見。</p>
<p>總之今日世界各國。多患同一之病。旣感經濟之因難。復因人心之不一。昔日所謂富强之國。昔日所謂全國一致之國。其根基皆已搖動。其不安之機。皆已潛伏。所不同者。特有顯有微。有深有淺。病象因而各異耳。</p>

<h3>付之一笑</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>理髮師（敎訓一個新來的學徒）—我們做生意。第一要客氣。見了客人。總要做出一張笑臉。說幾句恭維他的話。</p>
<p>學徒—師父。這是我辦得到的。但是我倘見了一位秃頂的客人。又待怎樣恭維他呢。</p>
<p>理髮師—你說。「先生的頭髮太長了。可要修剪一下麽。」</p>
<p>警察（見河邊一個孩子在哭。）—小朋友。你爲了甚麽事啊。</p>
<p>孩子（仍在哭着指點河心）—我的哥哥—警察（不等他說完。向河裏就跳。一會兒）取了一隻帽子起來。—怎麽說。河裏没有你的哥哥。</p>
<p>孩子—哥哥本來不在那裏。他把我的帽子抛在河裏。就逃跑了。我剛纔話没說完。你怎麽這樣的性急。</p>
<p>演講者（抬高了頭。滔滔汨汨的講出了）神。忽然停住了。見身旁一個少年在打呵欠。）—咦。同志。像我這樣的有精神的演講。你還聽得厭倦麽。</p>
<p>少年—我並不在聽。你瞧瞧四座。不見聽的人都已散盡了。我只等候着先生講完之後。預備掃地抹桌鎖大門哩。</p>
<h3>朱庵感舊記</h3>
<p>— 大可</p>
<p>金風乍起。玉露微零。叢桂巖阿。不無幽思。三百里内。以桂名者。推杭州之滿覺壟。與我禾之朱庵。滿覺壟以多。朱庵以古。皆薌林勝地也。按朱庵在禾城東南十里許。挈舟自宣公橋度南湖沿長水塘而往。約炊許可達。雙桂亭亭。轟立檐際。一七臺者。高二丈餘。一五臺者。高丈餘。並數百年物。或謂明代朱文恪公手植。檢曝書亭集。未載其事。殆不可考。庵祀伽藍神。比邱尼主之。疉經喪亂。緇流星散。殿宇亦垂垂就圯。里人金香嚴丈捐資修葺。始復舊觀。戊辰仲秋。余與香嚴丈及郭和庭起庭兄弟。邀同朱彊村烟丈劉佐泉次壁父子姚虞琴嚴畸　諸君。泛舟往遊。時林鐵尊丈司榷禾中。聞之亦惠然肯來。主客十人。盤桓竟日。和庭手寫朱庵訪桂圖。以誌鴻爪。香嚴丈以次各賦詞詩。題於卷後。自咤爲一時雅集。回首西風。忽忽三載。香嚴丈巳於去冬下世。余亦衣食奔走。興致索然。偶披舊圖。感慨係之。圖中題詞。推彊翁首唱。鐵老繼聲。二公爲當代周姜。海内詞流。早有定論。余不自量。亦成桂枝香一闋。彊丈謂似王半山之作。前輩宏奬。彌深愧恧。茲附錄於此。以當小山隱士之招。彊翁好事近云。遺世廣寒仙。香界别開蟾户。一例恒沙刦外。比月盤松古。（自注在盤山天成寺）色身不礙被黄絁。糝地碎金布。遮莫窮檐薪盡。供籜龍斤斧。鐵翁夜飛鵲云。天香度雲醖。金粟成堆花葉湧傍蓮臺。婆娑却散廣寒影。娟娟蟾鏡深開。釦鈿筐似承蓋。料推南間隱。斷夢初回。鐘聲定後。伴維摩百歲寒灰。清涙露盤消盡。金藥舊薌林。一例蒿萊。風外紅紗香滿。驚塵不到。瓔珞低徊。智瓊去久。　額黄與點秋杯。要木犀禪意。無言會取。月地重來。余桂枝香云。歸來懷抱。趁楓葉葦花。湖上秋早。聞得木犀香未。禪心易惱。伽藍零落鐘魚冷。賸團欒桂之樹好。祇園刦後。黄金布地。倩何人掃。且莫話淮南文藻。算閱盡興亡。一般草草。當日詞流醉處。憑誰指道。黄　人去經年事。絮斜陽白頭衰媪。不堪攀取。臨風笑我。鬢絲欲老。</p>
<h3>葷素辮線誤易之趣聞</h3>
<p>— 斅厂</p>
<p>平窰有韓某者。腦後尚垂髮辫。往歲年夜。韓就附近某理髮處理髮。旣畢。即歸家就寢。及登床盤辫。忽覺己之黑辫線已易爲白色。大恚。急至該理髮處詰責。而爲其理髮者。係店主金某。金被責。始而驚呆。繼乃悟。蓋白辫線。係當時另一主顧者。金某因夜深神昏。竟將此白辫線。誤繫韓某辫上。及韓復至。則另一主顧尚在店中理髮也。金旣自知錯誤。急向韓道歉。並爲之更換原物。韓聲勢洶洶。謂非保其來歲一年順利不可。嗣經旁人勸解。始怏怏而歸。不料事有凑巧者。蓋數日前。韓某之父。忽溘然長逝。韓以爲遭此大故。係上年誤繫白辫綫之故。於是怒不可遏。遂邀集多人。欲與該理髮處交涉。事爲鄰人宋某所悉。即出而勸阻。韓始罷休。誠巧事。亦趣聞也。</p>
<h3>補演名伶骨肉離合之一幕</h3>
<p>— 澤丞</p>
<p>前者報載名伶王芸芳。脫離義父關係一則。其生平事蹟。載諸各報曁有名雜誌者。猶覺語焉不詳。或詳而未實。茲就所知補之。似較眞確。初渠在髫年。即遭離亂。而所遭旣非天災。又非人禍。以翁婿不睦。音訊隔絕之故。遂致流亡。僅免一死。遇慘且奇。請實本談。以餉閱者。</p>
<p>閥閱世家　芸芳爲金壇望族。祖守勤。丙子孝廉。知山東東昌府事。父璧昌。亦山東丞碎。所至清廉有政聲。罷官回里之日士民歡送者數百人。大有昔日二疏致仕之風焉。</p>
<p>寄養外氏　芸芳四歲喪母。父以不善撫育。送往濟南舅家。外祖母鍾愛之。外祖父授之讀。生而穎慧。年甫九齡。即通文藝矣。</p>
<p>箠楚餘生　旣而外祖母卒。繼配凶悍無人理。榜笞刺剟五毒備至。凍餒猶其餘事。不得已出亡。外家旋亦遷徙。時父貧困在家復以音訊隔絕。淡然置之。</p>
<p>異樣簫聲　旣出亡。躑躅街頭。日則假說書爲吳市簫。夜則視邑裏鐘樓爲息影地。童年落魄。一至於斯。然其智不可及矣。</p>
<p>寄生不牢　會有向充鹽丁之邱某。憐其文秀。携之去。撫爲義子。冒邱姓。更名健周。居月餘。終以薰蕕不同器。復爲邱所逐。</p>
<p>漂母飯信　會歲墓。飢寒交迫。獨臥於磨車之上。適來二婦挽磨工作。一見而哀王孫。挈之歸。衣之食之。雖當年漂母不是過也。</p>
<p>身陷匪竄　一日忽遇邱於途。復隨之之曹縣。值匪陷曹城。身被擄。日在槍林彈雨中。（腿部彈㾗尤在）數月始得逃至濟南。</p>
<p>肄業學社　時魯省創辦易俗社。收俊穎子弟。普通敎育外。兼授戲曲。芸芳與焉。六年卒業。屢試冠軍。年已十八歲矣。</p>
<p>曹邱揚名　自是北遊燕京。師事王瑤卿　更進。復得孫君嘯林紹介和上海共　台及天蟾舞台。名益噪。皆孫君揄揚之力也。</p>
<p>獨丸認子　藝旣成名。各報爭傅軼事。直至今年春。父乃因閱報來滬訪子。一見絮談。事多脗合。尤以獨丸隱事爲鐵證不禁悲喜交集。於是骨肉復合之一幕。乃告實現云。</p>
<h3>誌野蘭花影片</h3>
<p>— 欣俯</p>
<p>野蘭花一片。爲葛萊泰嘉寶所主演。述一對美國伉儷。往遊爪哇。途中邂逅爪哇王子王子涎婦美乃佯與其夫友善。而暗施偷香竊玉之伎倆。旋以被未窺破秘情。大怒。因藉獵虎之機。圖斃王子。幸救助尚速未死。以是婦頗責夫之不應如此殘忍。夫以爲婦已傾心王子。憤而獨歸但待其登車時。則見婦巳守候車廂中。至是婦之心跡始大白劇情曲折離奇。殊非觀衆所能意料得到者。</p>
<p>嘉寶女士態度之美媚。藝術之高超。固已蜚聲中外。惟尚有一事足述者。即歷來嘉寶主演之片。所飾之女子。大都冶蕩不覊。但在此片中則係飾一艶如桃李冷若冰霜之少婦。始終不肯背棄其年事巳高之夫壻。而從彼風流倜儻之王子以去　其一種似有情似無情之態度。即觀者亦將爲之心醉嘉寶誠多能哉。</p>
<p>就背景言。則有富麗堂皇之爪哇宫殿。明媚秀麗之爪哇山水。就穿插言。則有盡熊極妍之爪哇跳舞、驚心動魄之猛虎撲人。均極可觀。該片巳定於雙十節前一日。起映於巴黎大戲院云</p>
<p>更正　十月四日拙稿「北站花絮錄」第三節末二三行。「其奈中將又函送轉來。曰非此不可」二語。查事實不符。特此自動更正蘭茜</p>
<h3>南洋游記（六一）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>七月十四號乾坤校長黄水田歐迎在其校演說。是日乃陰暦六月十九日。爲觀音誕日。道階法師萬慧師觀修尼鄭康綿陳佑嘉等在龍華寺發起觀音萬緣會。</p>
<p>十八日。安溪會館坐辦王其園請移住安溪會館。會長林庚申陳良糧招待。二十日韻新詩社仰光報經理陳守金等。請到詩社演講。參觀其社規頗可采。社員不滿百人。而成績斐然。其法每週一會。任意選二字。例如天宙用骰子擲幾點。即爲七言之第幾字。名第幾唱。成爲聯語。每人任作幾聯。每作一聯。須納銀二角。每卷用印好之紙條。無作者名。公舉社長評甲乙。假如百聯可取三十聯。有奬勵。四十聯爲中取。餘三十爲副取。而三十名之奬金。即出自百聯每人二角中。如一人作五聯。能取一聯。則可保本也。此乃其一例。此外尚有他法。總之此法較呆。作成首詩爲有趣。故久而不衰。余視其例作頗多名貴之聯。甚爲欣賞。誠海外文化之大觀也。衆請余講。余講題爲詩化運動。與人生革命大旨。述中國印度希　皆啟化於詩。古誦詩以爲政。今英國有詩官。美總統威爾遜參戰演說。謂詩人之力。人均不知。欲世界政治大改良。非詩人爲政不可。故我希望能多引新社員。并引女友詩人加入更好。并可闢少年部。以八九歲至十九歲者。白話詩亦可加入。音樂中西畫美術體育等高尚游戲。并可辦詩村焉。蓋余在北平。曾興覺華詩社。欲爲詩村運動。而未得良法也。海外運動。大有望焉。此眞提高國花文采者矣。結果衆選二字爲下次詩題。請余評詩。</p>
<p>二十三日再晤證道會書記。NaganattansSecralary　of　Theonofhical　Sociely上次余曾在該會講演一次。全體大贊成。此次余詢該會内容。乃知雖在緬甸。而主持者仍是印度人。此君亦印人。對於中印精神默契。心心相印。同事文化運動。將來余到印度。彼會將專派人同心招待。因該會在全球有千五百萬人。而會長爲印度女子也。復贈余以副女會長Mrs　　Cousing女士之覺悟一册。</p>
<h3>歐游通訊（七十六）</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>巡禮意大利日記</p>
<p>（二）余中（Ｃ</p>
<p>火車經過意法交界之際。約在下午三點左右、檢查過護照和行李。這是照例的手續。從這兒起。天氣漸漸熱起來。一切事物都感着不同了。最顯著令人感着不同的。是每一處車站上穿戴着拿破崙式的三角帽和服裝的憲兵。有的又在帽子上綴着蓬蓬鬆鬆的白毛或者黑鷄毛的東西。終是非常惹目的。還有許多幢幢往來的俊俏的少女。那蟬翼紗的闊邊的帽子。那淡黄色的靈巧的卦肩。這打扮眞是絕艶。這大約是意大利現今流行的裝束吧。意大利女子的美和法國是絕然不同的粗健活潑的身材。胸部隆起九十度弧形似的乳房、飽滿而抖動著。一些也不下垂。宛然希臘。羅馬的彫刻一樣。這是一種美感的迷惑。平直的鼻。蓬鬆柔媚的髮。櫻桃似的嘴唇。在嬌柔的眉毛之下。兩顆烏黑而含着波光的眼珠。都像蒂湘畫中的女神。眞討人尋味。她那動人的姿態。那活潑豐饒的表情之美。就是在西洋不論那一國都是少有的。</p>
<p>我們到了Turin算是告一段落。轉换了應該轉換的火車以後。就在車站吃飯。天氣巳經很熱了。熙熙樂命的意大利人。終是挺着身子向前進。嘴裏嘰呀嘰呀的清脆的聲音是非常入耳的。從前聽人家說。意大利語輕靈婉轉。清脆絕俗是頌讚神明的聖歌。法蘭西語。清明流麗是沙龍裏漂亮的交際說話。是人間的瀟灑的清音。我正有相類的感覺。火車又向東南開動了。一路眼見道旁一叢一叢葱鬱的樹林。有的地方生着很高很綠的椰樹地上滿生着碩大的仙人掌。草地的綠。綠得生油。因此。我纔覺得巳經嘗到了南歐的風味了。儘走儘走。大約走了一二小時吧。從Genes附近起。我們坐着的火車就一直沿着海濱走了。這是迪勒安尼海。Ｍer　Tyrrhenienne</p>
<p>南歐的靑天照映着一望無際的平靜的綠海。沿海濱的玲瓏秀雅的古屋。蒙着潮風挾着晴光包在愉快的氛圍中的這些地方。我一路看一路想。普陀山没有這樣秀。日本没有這樣雅。瑞士没有這樣闊。大。我想天下是少有如此的地方的。這樣的河山之氣。大概一定浸潤了意大利人的腦裏。而且渲染了他的性根的。</p>

<h3>紗花　擯持境地下的紗市觀</h3>
<p>過去現在和未來　棉紗市况似已成擯持之象、而徘徊於三四兩之間、上趨力似有所未逮、而回跌又屬不易、前途如何殊難揣測紗市在上月中旬形勢極爲　唐、詎醞釀數月之北方戰局有和平之仁訊、虚疲之市况頓告興奮不旬日間由四十七八兩而達五十三四兩、其勢殊銳、蓋紗市因　事及匪禍之蔓延與持久、萎靡已久、今以時局消息良好而回漲七八兩、殊未可認爲過激、然内地以兵匪爲患、元氣斷傷殆盡、又承去年歉收之後、現銷未能暢旺·蓋客帮態度雖以和平消息而興奮然以内地並無需要、但鑒於市况之看高、亦不得不略有吸進、此次現銷鈍屬此　現象、故成交數量最盛亦不過四五千包、四五千包之交易雖視過去之一二千包爲佳、然在久亂初定市况疲極反動之時、殊屬不多也、而美棉復由一角一分外而慘落、逼近一角故紗市漲風又受相當的打擊、遂暫告停頓矣、然跌風暫時似亦不易蓋和平空氣市場人氣當爲之激起、綜之、紗市雖有時局平和、足以促起市况之進展、但反抗的力量尚多、換言之、起市况上漲之力量同屬雄厚、然已爲其他原因所抵消、暫時將呈盤旋之局勢以待外界之引力而定其升沉也、</p>
<p>安穩靜定的人標人標紗上午以時局消息益形良好人氣頗爲穩定、各月漲三四錢、午後三品紗趨漲市勢仍穩、各月漲二三錢、統計全日成交一萬零五百包、各月價如下、</p>

<h3>原棉前途之悲觀</h3>
<p>美棉估計又增……世界消費反减</p>
<p>國内棉收歉薄……新棉上市　少　　外棉校銷甚力……本棉疲象愈顯　棉花市况呈徘徊不定之局勢、蓋視諸國内棉作情形、似無跌落之可能、然回顧國外棉市狀懲、殊難望其趨漲也、蓋美棉收成據近日來之報告、本届政府估計將視上次爲增、以天氣良好棉收頗爲順利、似有達一千四百五十萬包收成之希望、農務局雖有國積運動、然農民以一般的農産物價格虚軟、團積之心思殊屬淡薄况國積之原棉究將至何時出售、殊爲一殺商人所懷疑、生産旣有增加之象而消費方面令人悲觀、據最近美棉一週統計報告八月一日至十月三日止、原棉運赴美國廠家僅四十九萬五千包、比較去年同期减少八十三萬四千包之巨、即世界運廠美棉亦視去年同期减少八十三萬四千包、由此可見美棉消費之悲觀、生産增而消費减退、前途市况已可得其大概矣、至若印棉情况當然不能與美棉背　而馳、國内新棉收成以天氣不良而歉薄、棉農則不甘廉價出售、上市新棉　形减少、而廠商以印棉貶價競售、有大量之吸收、期貨之定約尤多、美棉成交亦不少數、内地新棉能擯持不動、市况或可暫告平定、然本棉之地位益形惡劣、若至不得已而出售、需要者以定期充足無意吸收、則將來棉市之趨勢、其疲象將更甚於今日、此種情形固直接影響於棉農、然國家經濟亦蒙重大之損失、蓋本棉上市旣少、又不願廉價掃售、需要者不得已而吸收外棉、故年來外棉之進口數字與年俱進據海關報告十六年外棉進口計值八千八百九十萬兩、十七年較减、迨十八年　增至一萬萬兩以上、恐本年之數字將更甚於去年、此巨量數字之漏巵、其對於棉農之影響將若何、殊足令人悲觀也、</p>
<p>漢標近漲遠跌　交易所漢標上午以美棉形勢仍疲、市氣頗虚但近月新棉到貨不湧、趨勢較平、遠月一跌二錢、午後以紗市較活、市氣平定近月漲五分至一錢遠月平疲、統計全日成交二萬六千六百担、各月價如下、</p>

<h3>糧食　節後米市上漲半元</h3>
<p>晚市轉趨呆懈　　　　閘北　昨日内地到源二十餘號、河存共計一百號左右、本　走銷初極爽暢、新粳又漲半元外、特别眞眞頂貨開至十八元兩角普通市高至十七元五六角、形勢大俏交易甚多、迨至午問晚市銷化立轉呆懈緣此次回漲已達兩元之鉅故在貨主方面、亦抱乘此時間脫售而買户因猛漲後、胃口銳减因此市氣一轉、趨勢遂呈不振矣今市設或開盤不免回疲未奇百哥等早稻亦見跟昂兩角羊杜尖來貨不旺客銷續進、價提三角左右、高貨大都開出十四元外、客埠秈大盤向上一兩角情况堅穩白元到貨仍稀、市銷平淡價鮮榮辱</p>
<p>滬南　河下見到三四十號市銷極暢新　均好四五角、各方買氣大爽舊存新到斛夫大半、即如中次貨成交亦鉅、開出大盤除頂貨與閘市相彷外餘均在十五元半左右、早稻紅稻悉提兩三角羊杜尖亦漲三角左右、高貨開十二元三四角、此間市况較北方爲和平、不果大勢仍須隨其而轉務也、</p>
<h3>標粉晨軟午稍振</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、因洋麥報價、徵有上落、各月份人心、亦兄盤旋、本月份因前月之大票棧單聞已由廠家售與津帮、致人心尚穩、遠期則以大部份人心不佳微覺　動迨至卜午開盤、本月份初以廠家表示不能抽買、故開休未佳旋因客帮略動、市氣　好遠期亦因空頭抵補、較上午稍形盤高、觀此後之結果、如北銷續動不致過落否則尚未可靠也、結果本月份較前週小七厘半、十一月份小七厘半、十二月份小一分正月份小二厘半二三月份小五厘云、</p>
<h3>期麥市疲怠向下</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份大致呈疲滯之象因目下大部份之標準空頭、直接均係本外埠之中小廠家、一方旣經定有洋委、在事實上已非完全做空者可比故應度甚定買方則屬業外居多、暫時自難對抗、所以交易雖稀、市價則繼見疲落也、結果本月份較前週小二分十一十二月份小二分、正月份小四分、二三月份小三分現麥因檢騐費用、尚未解决、故仍未開云、</p>
<h3>絲茶乾繭益呈疲滯</h3>
<p>邇來乾繭市面益呈疲滯、緣自廠經歐銷不振以來、繭市日趨疲靜、而滬埠絲廠又因反對公量、同盟罷業無錫等處、絲廠亦起響應、取一致行動、動繭廠銷益無生氣繭價步跌五六兩　春乾繭祗開一百三十兩（五百七八十斤練折）夏繭九十五兩、（七百斤繅折）均無人過問、</p>
<h3>遠期廠經漲一二十兩</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、囤户已發動、緣歐美各莊、鑒於横濱日絲遠期步漲二三十日元、全滬絲廠現又同盟罷業絲産益减、分起囤積　遠期滬廠經等進十一·二·月及一·二等月份滬白廠經六十包、價漲一二十兩、達昌進川廠經五包、價尚平定云、</p>
<h3>俄莊開辦紅綠茶</h3>
<p>本埠洋莊茶市、昨日以來、略呈熱閙之象、羣衆屬望之協助會、對於寗州紅茶及貢熙綠茶、業已正式開辦、成交共達三千餘箱、售價無上落、惟俄莊此次搜辦、係因船期迫切之故、華茶商鑒於本年貢熙茶額數不多、取價略爲堅挺、現下珍眉綠茶、南價日低、俄莊亦有動辦之望云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　長沙帮復起動辦</h3>
<p>溫台皖北因加捐事暫停</p>
<p>本廠市　邇來實銷尚暢、市面無甚變更、惟現貨因各廠時有罷工事件、故如十磅三鹿·三兎粗布、十二磅陽鶴·藍雙魚·斜、十一磅猫英·粗斜俱呈供不應求之狀、細布仍形不振、實以各廠有巨額開出之故、但染坯去路較暢、昨川帮成交一百多件、濟南·徐州等埠亦時有添辦、　布本街頗形活動、成交十六磅雙魚·吉慶九兩四錢半、十五磅電車九兩一錢等一百五十件云、</p>
<p>東西疋　實銷轉呆、良以温台·皖北各埠、均有加捐事件故咸各停辦、惟長沙帮昨又活潑、進東貨之之雙龍水浪　二錢二分七厘半、大曲馬明呢三錢四分半、太陽美人印花直貢呢三錢二分等二百餘件、川帮需胃尚殷、獵雁慕秋直貢呢三錢二分七厘半、麻姑直貢緞二錢八分二厘半鷄　大枯絨二錢零五厘、蕉集中山呢二錢七分七厘、俱有辦去、西貨放鯉直貢呢長江帮、需要甚殷、價已至二錢六分矣、</p>
<h3>南北貨　天津紅棗不日可到</h3>
<p>津開八兩</p>
<p>天津紅棗陳貨申存已告斷檔、新貨地頭首盤已開、昨據電訊價爲八兩、不日即可到申、預料勢必穩俏棉紅棗前價爲七兩半、昨聞津號家開七兩八錢、行售北規亦由七兩二錢升七兩半、至紅棗到貨稀而走場旺、趨勢頗佳、現市價爲九兩至六兩四錢、次四兩四</p>
<h3>五金　竹節鋼暴跌十餘兩</h3>
<p>竹節鋼條　來到貨疊疊、而成本低廉、故同業之有到貨者、莫不博獲厚利、惟市價方面、因到廣出滯、反見回落、最近數日、復因建築帮用户有大批到貨、致標準暴跌十餘兩、計一分至寸半統花色祖估九十三四兩、而花色較次者則祗開九十兩、較之最大價跌落四十兩、查最近售價同業仍有利圖、而執貨者復十分衆多、帮前途標準殊不易樂觀也、</p>

<p>致開會詞　　主席市長代表俞鴻鈞致開會辭、略云、各位來賓、今天是上海市社會局第三届國貨運動大會宣傳週舉行開幕典禮、承各位光臨、本市政府覺得非常榮幸、關於提倡國貨的重要、各位想多早已知道、現在我再作一個簡單的報告、中國白南京條約訂立以來、受經濟壓迫、在一千八百七十六年之前、洋貨的進口、還不如國貨出口數量之多、自一千八百七十六年以後、洋貨逐漸暢銷、到現在日用品十九多要靠洋貨、我們一看海關統計、莫不怵目驚心、我們中國國際的地位、日漸沉淪、全國民衆、應趕緊覺悟起見、大家抵制洋貨、但是抵制洋貨、巳不止一次、像民國八年、抵制美貨、民國十四年、抵制英貨、當我們抵制英美國貨的時候、日本貨乘機暢銷、所以效果仍很微、所以要抵制外貨非先提倡國貨不可、我們遵總理遺敎、把宣傳國貨運動列人七項運動之一、我們總得竭力設法完成這使命、現在說到提倡國貨應該從三方面同時發　第一、是注重國貨生産、注重生産、應分兩方面、（一）農産、（二）工業農産方面、中國向來是以農立國的、農産物像絲茶等類、多在世界各國有相當地位、後來日本印度多逐漸改良興旺起來、而我國的出品、反而衰落以致失敗、又像米是農産主要物以農立國的我國、甚至於自己出産的米、不夠吃、要仰給於外貨、這是多麽可恥的事情啊、痛定思痛、這到底是什麽原因呢、工業方面、現在雖然落後、其實雕刻建築印刷、多是我們中國發明的、向來世界各國多很羡慕、但是不知改良以致衰退落後、現在應該用科學方法來改良製造、以期進步、第二、是國貨銷路方面、實在我們中國人的商業道德、和商業常識太嫌缺乏、國貨好的很多、因爲宜傳不得法、像絲茶之類、在國際宣傳方面不得其法、以致外國人不喜用我國貨、又像我們中國四川等處、出一種仿製巴拿馬草帽、這種草帽、在美國很盛行在中國因爲宣傳不得力、反而没有銷路、又因商業道德太劣、在金賤銀貴像民國六七八年間貪廉進口的洋貨數量可驚、只知爲個人發財、不知國際關係、及顧到羣衆利害、以致於國貨很失敗、如果商人能注重商業上的道德、和常識那時國貨的銷路才有希望、第三是要使國貨適合人民的需要、因爲國民對於國貨的購買和選擇、是以價各及貨品的優劣、爲取吉之標準、雖然工商的進步非一日之功、但是我們總希望能夠絕對不需要用洋貨才好、我們現在舉行這第三個國貨運動大會、正值前方軍事將要結束的時候、交通不久便可恢復、俟反動份子肅清消滅之後、内政和外交、方有辦法、稅則亦可慢慢减輕、人民能安居對業國貨的銷路、也可增加、現在在金貴銀賤的時候、正是提倡國貨的機會、倘能大家起來努力、國貨才有發揚光大的一天、</p>
<p>籌備經過　社會局長潘公展　報告籌備經過略謂我們今天舉行第三届國貨動運大會開幕的原理、方才我們已聽過市長的代表俞秘書長說得很明白了、我現在要說我們對於這國貨運動大會爲什麽也須一年舉行一次、以及此次籌備的經過情形、費二三分鐘的時間來報告一下、民國十七年七月是我們第一次舉行這國貨運動大會、那時候政府建都南京未久、一切政治的設施止在開始進行覺得一般人民吃的·穿的·用的·都是洋貨、每年因用洋貨而輪給外國人的金錢要二萬萬元以至三萬萬元這是以出口貨抵銷進口貨剩餘的數目來計算、就是每人每年差不多要貢獻給外國人一塊錢、我們現在要想方法把這一塊錢、不要再從荷包裡面拿出去、送給外國人、只有趕緊起來、提倡國貨、我們舉行國貨運動大會、也就是爲此但是我們中國人、向有五分鐘熱度之譏所以提倡一項、恐怕没用、必須每年來上一次、直到完全達到我們的目的之日爲止、現在來參加大會的人回去、大家必須去傳說、父敎子、兄敎弟、千萬不要忘記、我們要想法、不要再每年每人進貢外國人一塊錢了、去年舉行大會、在雙十節前後、今年亦在雙十節前後、要使大家知道　爲什麽要用國貨、以及怎樣去發展國貨、並且使大家回去、各白勉勵家人、至於辦這國貨運動大會的經費、是市政府每年撥出三四千塊錢來　同時得到工商各界的贊助、有的捐金錢、有的揭物品、一方面可以使我們的國貨運動大會、辦得有聲有色一方面了可以替他們自己的出品、宣傳一下、像綢緞業方面、捐了許多的現金、同時還捐了許多衣料、其他各工廠捐錢和捐物品的也很多、一星期之</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>内天天在此有遊藝以及關於國貨的演講、又揀了一天在大華飯店舉行國貨時裝展覽會、現在大家只知道穿衣服好看、非買外國貨不可、其實中國廠家、也有很好出品、嗶嘰也有、呢絨也有如果要穿西裝、也可買國貨衣料、至於綢緞更不必說假使說外國貨、一定比中國貨好、那是差了、並且有許多中國貨非常之好、像美亞織綢廠、及杭州虎林公司等出品實質比外國貨來得好、但是因爲買客喜歡要買外國貨、店家又因外貨利厚、國貨利薄、譬如外貨每尺成本一元、可以買至三元四元買客不知原價、也不能到外國廠家去問如果是國貨、至多照批價加上二三分錢、再要加多、人家便不相信、萬一到出品的廠家去一問即知、所以有許多綢店、要求廠家織成了外國廠家的牌號、冒充外國貨來買好價錢、這種情形、到各店家去一調查、便能明白、所以國貨時裝展覽會、是全體穿了國貨原料的服裝、來表明一切的時裝衣服、男女平常服裝獵裝等等都可以用國貨原料來做、至於爲什麽要在大華飯店舉行、是因爲道裡地方不夠、此外尚有許多宣傳的地方、這幾日隨便到各處走走都可看得見又提倡國貨的責任、不好專推在廠家、因爲一般人不採用國貨、豈不是要呌國貨的廠家虧本、所以我們是好要仿效日本人的樣子、儘管日本貨不比西洋貨好、日本人一定要用日本貨、才有辦法並且我國大家用國貨使國貨廠家賺了錢、自然能夠逐漸地改良起來了、像這裡國貨商場雖是虧本但仍舊極力維持、在一條南京路上、一百家店家之内、幾乎九十九家、是買洋貨的一完全國貨的商店不到百分之一、尤其是此處永安先施等洋貨商塲集中的處所、要立住一個國貨商塲、來和洋貨竸爭、原是很不容易、須得我們大家想方法、共同來維持他、就是要生産消費合作起來、乘這國貨運動宣傳週裡面、各方面大家起來努力、我們的希望就是如此、另有名人演說辭長從略、</p>

<p>延殘窮途潦倒　湖南衡山人衛民、字延織、近又改名延殘、蓋取其在世並無樂趣、而苟延殘喘之意、家有妻室一、口吐揚州音、生一子、年約十一二歲、衛失業日久、窮途潦倒、於上月五日、由原籍帶司妻子乘輪來滬謀生、寄宿於本埠愛多亞路大世界西首餘樂里五一五號中央公寓二樓十六號房間、每月房金大洋十五元、但所帶盤費有限、每日開支、無非依賴衣服典質現金化用、其生活之苦况、諒非筆墨所能描寫其萬一、</p>
<p>全家投浦自殺　衛民文墨不惡、曾草一文、投寄報館、但稿長十餘萬言、未能揭載、衛民至爲失望、所謀復一無所成、乃蓄心自殺、本月五日晚、在所宿之中央公寓内、書寫絕命書、時至午夜、茶房正欲關熄電火、而術以作信爲辭、要求緩熄、嗣茶房留心其舉動、見其埋首案頭、作書達旦始臥、衛六日臥至午後、深晚又帶同妻室及子、不别出外、臨行留致該寓經理書一、内容即表示吞服毒物、惟欲死得乾凈、故去投浦等語、該公寓等至天明、（即昨晨）未見衛等歸來、恐有變故、乃入其房間内察看、見桌上留書一封、拆閱一過、知若輩均巳自殺去矣、但挽救亦已不及、亦惟徒嘆莫可如何耳、</p>
<p>遺書凄慘萬狀　衛臨行所留致該寓經理吳運祺書、文長凡百言、一字一涙、不忍卒讀、茲抄錄於下、中央公寓經理先生惠鑒、鄙人不學無術、年來諸事輒逆、非特是個庸夫、尤其是個弱者、今已與屈大夫爲伍矣、意此落局、亦殊自嘆、在人必駡我未嘗修積、在我尚自問從未負人、一生事跡、向誰訴言、抵滬以來、已四十餘日、投輒不着、氣運可知、此外又不能武、又不能藝、一家數口、其何生活、若論滬地、原極富庶、詎哀鴻竟是遍野、求憐求助者、又幾滿坑滿谷、豈非乞討、亦無鄙人餘地、不知鄙人生性執拗、向見苟延喘息、當街呌化者猶且恥以毫無志氣、未免預備一死、亦不爲其祖宗門第爭光、鄙人不敢稱節烈、然而自問尚有血性、特將弱妻幼子、先自處斃、亦惟恐其遺留獨世、貽羞故鄉、同歸於盡、庶可稱乾凈也、今在貴寓棲遲三十二天、無非依靠典質度日、有爲逐漸變賣殆盡、尚餘物什、又值幾何、幸於貴寓房金、勉能歸結清楚、欠亦祗昨今兩日、但尚有餘房内衣物、儘可以變價收償、餘則賞茶房及倒馬桶人、亦即爲鄙人後言、祇未死於貴公寓者、亦誠恐累貴主人耳、故又服藥後、投向江中、蓋亦冀圖清白之故、今祇求能將所留文稿、載諸新聞、或托訪員、俾能表彰辜生、即所以慰鄙人於地下矣、貴寓想不乏熱烈君子、倘能助成鄙志、寗忘結草圖報、心思忽忽、拉雜留言、諸維鑒照、此請財安、（下略）</p>

<p>衛民可望有救　該捕房旣據舢舨夫將衛送來、即設法灌以姜湯等物、但衛仍臥地不省人事、捕頭恐有别種原因、立命華探程永年將其舁送上海仁濟醫院救治、經醫生診得、衛於投浦之先、曾服有多量之鴉片烟所致、旋以種種手術、先將毒質完全打清、衛始漸漸蘇醒、但神智仍極衰弱、語音低微、惟至昨日午後、身體已漸轉强、據醫生云、可無生命之虞、捕房捕頭得此消息、仍諭留養院中、迨精神體力、完全恢復原狀、再候設法救濟、</p>
<p>衛妻屍身發現　衛妻投水自殺身死之後、屍身已於昨日上午十一時、在虹口東洋公司碼頭、突然浮起、上身穿黑色短衣、下穿藍華絲葛袴、小足、髮梳辫子髻、終計沉於浦底、未滿七小時、故面目宛然如生、尚無十分浮腫、是時適有水巡捕房四十五號華捕巡江經過發見、將屍撈至捕房、經捕頭派探傳到中央公寓人員到來、認明該女屍確係衛妻屍身無悮、捕頭諭將屍運送救生局先行備棺代爲收殮、候衛出院具領、</p>

<p>靑年園地</p>
<h3>星期六—虹口公園</h3>
<p>— 葵恩</p>
<p>在星期六的下午、似乎一切均在活躍、尤其是那雖靠近城市而却還帶有自然色彩的虹口公園、更顯出人們爲生活的忙碌疲勞、而對於自然更增加了無限的濃厚興趣、他們、她們的情緒是非常緊張活躍、然而又非常自然、在碧綠的草地上蓋着蔚藍色的天空、草塲週圍種着的樹、似乎一動都不動地在休息、雖然不時有帶着溫和日光的微風吹着、牠也不過略擺了一擺、搖了幾搖、後來落下幾片黄葉、免致使微風掃興、這是時近廢歷中秋的一天、因着連日來都在括着凛烈肅殺的寒風、人們有的是在家中蟄伏着、有的是正在忙着生活上應盡的工作、閒着没　的朋友也情願花幾角錢去看電影、有誰肯去領略那含有肅殺氣的秋景、然而今天可不同了、肅殺的寒風已變了溫和可愛的微風、公園内蠕動着一大堆人影在蠢動、足以表現人們今天的興緻特别濃厚、</p>
<p>沁的生性本來是很愛好自然、所以天天也得花幾個銅板坐電車到離二三里路遠的虹口公園去呼吸一些新鮮空氣、賞鑒一些自然的風景、今天的美景、當然更不能使她例外、</p>
<p>天天到公園都是她一個人去的、她尤其不喜歡和異性的朋友一起去、因爲她最怕别人用異樣的眼光射着她、倒反不如一個人來得自由自在、她喜歡一個人靜悄悄地鑒賞那自然的景緻、虫鳥的鳴聲、魚的躍水、……一切……都是牠獨自忻賞的好資料、她是從小在鄉間長大的、所以對於那般釣魚的日本人她是非常注意注意他們有此種特殊的權利、</p>
<p>因爲她是最喜歡釣魚的、她常站在旁邊看釣魚、她的兩目是很集中地注視那擊釣竿線上的記號、只要那記號稍微動了一動、她就知道是有魚來吃餌了、那時她的情緒是非常緊張、心是拍拍地在跳動、然而等到釣魚的日本人很平常地牠釣竿拉上時、這又使她失望了、她輕視日本人的笨拙不會釣魚、她迴憶自已從前鄉居的時候、如何的會釣魚、手裏拿了許多魚在將回到家的時候、想着家裏人看着了自己釣了這許多魚將怎樣的快樂、自己是驚喜得連心裏都在拍拍地跳、恨不得三步掽作兩步的趕速把這許多魚呈獻在與她有同樣嗜好父親面前、……這些的廻憶均足使她感着現在技癢難敖、眞的、日本人好像眞的不會釣魚、他們把香餌用力地鼕的一聲擲入水中、她想水中的魚早跟着這巨大的聲浪逃跑了、那裏還會再來吃釣、其餘如香餌的配置、置放釣竿的位置、一切均足使她覺着日本人釣魚技術的粗劣不及她、她想起日本是著名的水産國家、水産物又是他們出産品的大宗、難道他們是只會用强蠻的捕捉方法、而不會用文明的釣魚方法、這大概是他們所含有的帝國主義的特性的表現了、然而她又想着姜太公釣魚是「願者上鈎、「日本人釣魚或是是在模倣我國古時的文化吧、</p>
<p>有兩個日本小孩在她面前嘻戲、她用力將雙目注視在這兩個日本小孩的身上、她想從他們的身上籌出一些他們所以爲帝國主義的模型來、他們背着書包、她在推測着安放在裏面的印着日本文字的幾本國民敎科書裏面、一定有地理和歷史的科、歷史敎科書裏面有一篇是說明日本怎樣的取中國的滿洲、地理敎科書裏面亦有一張把中國的滿洲劃入日本疆域的地國、當一個日本致科在敎台上講指劃時、一般帝國小國民是如何靜心地在聽、……公園外的日本兵士打靶聲、仍然在繼續不斷地響着、使她覺着這完全不是推測而是事實、</p>
<p>該是吃晚飯的時候了、她還是留意着不肯回去、因爲她覺着在這裏的人生好像是特别的有意義些……</p>

<p>汽車新聞</p>
<p>專論</p>
<h3>一九三一年之新别克汽車</h3>
<p>— 吉</p>
<p>經三年之澈底改造與路面試騐。而完成今日之豐功偉績者。即一九三一年式之八汽缸新别克汽車也。新車之優點甚多。八汽缸之引擎。改良馬達。變速機。車身與裝修。今巳在全國各地之别克經理處陳列。以供參觀。</p>
<p>數十年來。别克始終根據其標語而行事。「優美之汽車。惟别克能造之。」今一九三</p>
<p>一年之新别克。又爲汽車業增光不少。</p>
<p>别克機師在近三年中。專心研究製造。深信一九三一年之新出品。所有構造式樣。在各車中。確爲最精美盡至者。故敢將新出品今日獻諸各界。</p>
<p>新車馬達當爲衆矢之的。據美國通用汽車公司經理克利時氏云。新車汽缸加至八只。持色增添許多。車機各部。均經加工改良。質料處處優選。旣講外觀。又重實際。此所以别克汽車能風行於世。而有二百五十萬輛每日行駛於全球大道之上。</p>
<p>一九三一年之新别克有四種輪距。八—五十號之輪基爲一一四时。八—六十號</p>
<p>者一一八时。八—八十號者爲一一四时與八—九十號者爲一三二时。並有各式蓬車與轎車之闊大飛顯車身。適合各種别克輪距。任君選擇。</p>
<p>新車均有直綫形八汽缸。頭上汽門之引擎。大小與機力均與輪距重量相稱。八—五址號用二时作分之七之對徑與四時四分之一之衝程供給機力。移置面積二二○·七·立方时。每分鐘凡三千轉。可産七十七匹馬力。</p>
<p>八—六十號輪距之引擎有三时十六分之一對徑與四时八分之五之衝程。移置面積二七二·六立方时。每分鐘旋轉三千次。發生九十匹馬力。</p>
<p>八—八十號與八—九十號輪距之引擎。均有三时十六分之五之對徑與五时之衝程。移置面積三四四·八立方时。每分鐘二千八百轉。可生一百另四匹馬力。以上四種馬達之能力。堅固與耐久。均極高超。</p>
<p>别克機師今所發明之油溫節制器。在汽車機械設備中。尚屬第一次。機油與引擎滑面常因熱力或氣候之影響。往往縮漲失效。此器之優點即在寒冬酷暑之時與激烈駕駛之下。引擎油質不變。油量不减。有力不失。構造形如小水箱。在唧水器與汽缸壁間之散熱系内。油自唧器射出。經此關口。流入引擎時。執巳散去。天寒時節。引擎内之機油凍冷。油溫節制器能使冷油變熱。並保持其日常溫度。化熱方法。即賴水蒸熱氣之溫和。特環流動。俾油液注入機器動作各部。」</p>
<p>壓力上油至總滑面。拐軸瓦。接桿滑面。搖桿靠手。準時齒輪與前電氣系滑面。直接迅速。充分周到。尚有濾油器與偏心通風系各一。常使油質清潔。</p>
<p>新别克之偏心軸均有五個大號總滑面。各軸量力平衡。微力測量器在偏心盒内。完人不爲　污侵犯。普通裝於引擎外部。垢污堆積。時礙工作。</p>
<p>别克機師經三年之試騐。深知將此五大堅强之偏心軸瓦與鋼圈平衡器合於一起。可以輕快省事不少。且能將滑面直往與面積放大。更加堅固耐久。而其上油亦最圓滿。</p>
<p>雙式炭化系。凡八—六十五號。八—八十號與八—九十號之引擎均有。無論快車慢車。爬山加速。藉此可得超等動作。每只炭化器供給四只汽缸之汽。汽自進汽管送入。簡便可靠。經濟異常。無需另添火星塞。發火電圈及其他機件。</p>
<p>别克汽車之汽門準時器與特配凈氣器。打倒一切進氣震聲。且産生十足機力。别克之頭上汽門。亦使車行時。靜寂無聲。鍜鐵活塞。質輕性堅。毫不顚盪。久用不損。風扇軸内。油流不絕。油由齒輪唧器内射出。比人工注油器。當然大不相同。拐軸駕駛器爲直接齒輪式。</p>
<p>新别克之傳力盒。自動整理。久用潤滑。無容常顧慮。祇須對於踏片稍加整理而已。八—五十號與作—六十號裝單片傳力盒。八—八十號與八—九十號裝雙片傳力盒。致其任重力亦較大。</p>
<p>齒輪變速器爲今年新别克之特産。除八—五十號外。其他三種均有。此種設置。大都祇高價汽車始有之。今新别克。車旣上選。價又公道。並有上項設備。殊爲難得。</p>
<p>此變速器自動處理。决無衝突。吃排時聲息全無。簡便無比。在任何速力之下。均能運用應手。且其構造堅實。能勝各種艱險。更於緊急時。如上山下坡。車排可以隨伸縮。吃排甚快。</p>
<p>齒輪變速器係一簡單結實之組織。直接動作。無需整理。第一速度與倒車齒輪。爲定例式斜形齒輪。第二速度之齒輪均準時相合。第一排至第二排亦然。吃排次序不亂。因有斜面齒輪傳力盒與圓錐形磨擦互聯機之準時機關加以節制。是以得免衝碰。</p>
<p>八—五十號仍用普通式之三速度變連器。然其傳力盒之轉動部輕之小巧。故其運用亦極靈便。亦無阻滯。</p>
<p>蠕蟲式與螺旋式之駕駛齒輪除八—五十號外。其餘均有。並在表版上即可處理。加以前座活動。因之駕車時頗覺舒服。車制之改良亦與其他特色並駕齊馳。簡而强大。地位寛舒。在極快速度時。該項機械作用「守夫」式之車制。甚爲堅忍可靠。敏捷靈便。</p>
<p>著名别克集中輪距上油系。仍舊保留。蓋經疊次試騐。此系頗稱簡靈。上油工作迅速。因其唧油機關完善。各輪距滑面均有一油管通到。上油十分周到。不必經過其他部分。</p>
<p>速力每小時可八十哩之多。快慢隨意。安穩無比。疾駛時寂靜無聲。路面行駛穩妥。無論爬山落坡。極爲可靠。新引擎之加速率每小時約十哩至六十哩。且較他車快五秒鐘。</p>
<p>别克機師對於速度深加考慮。向至保守穩當如妙。故高烈速度。不輕易勸用。平均速度。八一五十號者爲每小時七十哩。八—六十號者七十五哩。八—八十號與八—九十號者可至八十四哩之多。頗爲穩適。</p>
<p>新車均爲飛顯車身。飛顯手工素來著名。故新别克之車身與輪距。均極堅强牢靠。秀美絕倫。架　全部工程亦十分堅忍穩當。</p>
<p>新别克内部設置與手藝。極其精細。尤其壯麗。呢羢緞布及邊繩皮革。之質地與色澤。均爲優選美觀。</p>
<p>車機控制器具之格式與地位。亦甚相稱。駕駛乘坐其間。舒適暢快。齒輪桿與手用制桿亦移至前部。故駕駛員之紳足地位。較前寛大。致於右面駕駛之車輛。亦加改良手用制桿在裝齒輪桿之左。加速踏板頗合紳脚地步。</p>
<p>新别克之機件設備中。最著名者有引擎熱表測量表。水壓量油表。同時發火器與駕駛關閉器。九十哩之速度表。趾形加速踏板。雙片眞空作用之風擋刷。凡八—六十號八—八十號與八—九十號轎車均裝用之。其他爲單片式。直接與間接表板電光。與蓬車用之雙制風擋。</p>
<p>其他改良爲四懸點橡皮引擎座子。改良水箱座子。新式出汽系。新式全片後軸殼。堅强架框。新式防震器與座子。改良車身座子。新式水箱蓋。新式鍍鉻車蓬鏈釘。完全鍍鉻電燈設備。新式登車板鑲嵌物與接構器。改良箱架。新式駕駛舵輪。新式表板。橡皮包裹之加速踏板。新式地毯與底深富麗座位。</p>
<h3>八萬九千英里汽車蜜月旅行</h3>
<p>— 沛</p>
<p>固特異車胎跋涉長途</p>
<p>居住紐約九十八條街一百三十九號之阿倫夫婦。嘗駕汽車作兩年之世界蜜月旅行。新近自外國返美。其旅行所遇之境地。有革命。水災及酷熱難當之沙漠。渠等所用之汽車其行程届七萬五千英里。所備之固特異車胎。其中一枚之行程已達四萬英里之多。</p>
<p>阿氏夫婦之汽車不啻一家庭也。車中具有露宿之各種用具。無讑畫夜。車一停駛。即能隨處安居。搭成廚房。食堂。及整衣室等。一至晚間。將車内之坐墊略一改置。即成一舒適之臥室焉。</p>
<p>阿倫君與阿倫夫人相遇於菲律濱島。在中國結婚。一千九百二十八年三月自上海出發度蜜用。渠等旅行之全程計共八萬九千英里。其中之一萬六千英里係在中國所過。</p>
<p>阿氏夫婦作此長途旅行之動機。言之亦頗饒興趣。旅行所用之汽車係在中國配製而成。車身則係阿倫君指揮華人所造成。阿氏言渠因覓得舵輪一枚。乃决心造成一輛汽車云。</p>
<p>渠等先由上海搭輪赴馬尼刺。在菲律賓島旅行後。乘船往新加坡。而自馬來駕車至檳榔嶼。旣抵其地換船至加爾喀搭。駕車作印度漫遊。阿富汗首次革命發動時。阿氏夫婦適於此時駕車而往。阿倫夫人爲保持安全起見獨乘飛機而行。阿倫君則繞行曲折之道駕車前進。得免革命黨人之注意。阿倫夫人即於此地爲革命黨人所拘捕。逃逸之時。手臂中强受傷。阿倫君於逃難之時曾受三次之槍擊。亦云險矣。</p>
<p>阿倫夫婦第二次所經歷者爲印度西北方卡息米耳之水災。其時夫婦二人正駕車作三個月之行程。經由印度沙漠至俾路芝斯坦。然後再返孟買也。渠等買舟至亞登。阿拉伯。更自蘇彝士運河至紅海。埃及之開羅。及寶德舍而至意大利。法蘭西。芳的卡羅。英吉利。最後乃搭「布蘭加利」輪逕返紐約故居。</p>
<p>總之阿氏夫婦所經歷者。在中國遇革命兩次。阿富汗革命一次。印度則雖未爆發而所去亦未遠矣。渠等之度蜜月不僅旅行已也。渠等經過旅行家所不經見之事物。並作大規模之行獵及訪問印度羣王。惟有一事足令阿氏夫婦常帶念及故鄉者。即渠等萬里長征之時。其車上携一固特異車胎之廣告以俱行也。</p>

<p>— 卓</p>
<p>全世界之汽車總計。巳超乎二千四百五十萬輛。將來之增加。尤其未可限量。縮短陸地上之距離。汽車之功績誠大矣哉。惟是各國交通事業之發達程度。各有不同。而汽車之多寡。恒可覘出交通事業發達程度爲何若。據日本内閣統計局出版之列國國勢一覽。其間列示各國汽車之輛數。至爲翔確。吾人就其統計而比較</p>
<h3>維也納學習汽車駕駛之準備</h3>
<p>奥國維也納此間警務處近採用一種「心理學機器」。以考試學習汽車駕駛員。圖示一被試者正聚精會神。雙手把小舵輪。徐引鉛筆在一幅車輛最擁擠街市地圖上行動情形。圖下爲圓柱。内通電。故能自轉也。</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>之。則美國佔第一位。蓋美國之汽車輛數。育一千九百九十萬輛之多。英吉利居第二位。法蘭西居第三位。加拿大居第四位。日本雖亦號稱强國。然巳居於全世界之第二十一位矣。緣日本所有汽車之輛數。僅爲三萬五千八百餘輛耳。以言我國。則更居於全世界之第三十五位。以我國所有汽車輛數。祇一萬四千而不足耳。美國每一萬人口中。　有汽車一千七百輛以上。我國每一萬人口中。只三輛汽車耳。我國汽車事業之幼稚。爲何如乎。爰將日本内閣統計局關於全世界各國之汽車統計。譯出以歷警惕。日本内閣統計局出版之列國國勢一覽。雖在民國十七年出版。而此種全世界之統計。亦頗有一幣之價值也。</p>

Not only has the enemy's route of retreat in western Henan been cut off, but their retreat to the north will also not be easy. On the Ping-Han front, Liang Guanying sent a trusted aide to Bian to pledge allegiance. I have already requested that the Commander-in-Chief grant him the position of General Commander.

Moreover, Ji Hongchang's and Zhang Yinxiang's units, which have already pledged allegiance, departed south yesterday in compliance with orders, sincerely submitting. It is estimated that since Yan Feng betrayed, being arrogant for half a year, they are eliminated in one fell swoop. It is expected that everyone will be delighted. Holding the telegram, I respectfully report. Liu Zhi respectfully sends this message. Special dispatch of the 7th</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Recent Domestic Disturbances in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Many countries around the world are experiencing domestic unrest in recent times. Brazil has followed Bolivia and Argentina in South America with revolutionary movements. Their influence has already reached five provinces. Although the capital is still quiet, intense behind-the-scenes plotting is underway. Overthrowing the government is only a matter of hours. The strike in northern Spain is still ongoing. Riots have already broken out, resulting in twelve deaths and numerous injuries. The local authorities are urgently requesting reinforcements, otherwise they will be unable to maintain order. According to reports, the strike had no political connections at the beginning. Now, however, it has been exploited by extremists. The Romanian cabinet has resigned en masse due to disagreements with the king. Although the reason given is illness, the real reason is irreconcilable differences. Romania may experience further troubles as a result. The convocation of the German parliament is approaching, but the government's financial negotiations have yet to be secured. The Steel Helmet League has even staged a march of 120,000 people, demanding the revision of the Treaty of Versailles and the return of German territories ceded. The extent of their unrest can be imagined.</p>
<p>In summary, countries around the world today suffer from the same illness. They are burdened by economic difficulties and internal divisions. The foundations of so-called wealthy and powerful nations, and of those countries that were once considered nationally united, have been shaken. The seeds of unrest are latent. The differences lie only in the degree of manifestation, depth, and intensity. The symptoms therefore vary.</p>
<p>Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams</p>
<p>(Beiping) Received a confirmed report that Gu Zhutong and Liu Zhi's Central Army had occupied Zhengzhou. (Special Dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Military News: The General Headquarters train is scheduled to move from Bian to Zheng on the 8th. Chiang has already discussed the post-Northwest Army arrangements with Ma and Zhang. Implementation will begin immediately after arriving in Zheng. (Special Dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Xuzhou-Zhengzhou telegraph line was restored to full operation on the evening of the 7th. (Special Dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang to Return to Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) With the end of the fighting south of the Yellow River and the situation having reached a conclusion, Chiang Kai-shek plans to return triumphantly to Nanjing on Double Tenth Day. At the same time, major issues such as the Fourth Plenary Session of the Executive and Supervisory Committees and the Fourth National Congress will be decided. (United Press Report, 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fourth National Central Committee meeting has been scheduled for mid-October. The Standing Committee meeting this week will finalize and announce it. It is reported that the date of the Fourth National Congress and the amnesty proposal will be decided at this meeting. (Special Dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<h3>National Government Appoints Liu Zhi, Member of the Henan Provincial Government, as Concurrent Chairman</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government recently issued an order appointing Liu Zhi, Liu Maoen, Wan Wu, Liu Yaoyang, Liu Jixue, Zhang Feiran, and Zhang Fang as members of the Henan Provincial Government, with Liu Zhi concurrently serving as Chairman of the Provincial Government, Wan Wu concurrently serving as Director of the Department of Finance, Zhang Feiran concurrently serving as Director of the Department of Construction, and Zhang Fang concurrently serving as Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. This is the order. (Special Dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Inauguration Date</h3>
<p>Scheduled for the 9th of this Month (Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang is scheduled to assume the position of Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force on the 9th. The Central Government has telegraphed Wu Tiecheng, and the National Government has sent Zhang Qun as representatives to administer the oath and deliver an address. (Special Dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Official news: Zhang Xueliang has scheduled his inauguration as Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force on Double Tenth Day. Yu Xuezhong will assume the position of Garrison Commander on the same day. (Special Dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Requests Passage from Shi Yousan</h3>
<p>Lu Zhonglin Arrives in Xinxiang (Beiping) Railway Bureau News: Feng is still at Zhongyidian. Liu Ji arrived in Xinxiang to meet with Shi, requesting passage to Shanxi. Although Shi agreed, Feng has not yet been willing to go to Xinxiang rashly. Feng may go from Zhongyidian through Qinghua Town to Xiuwu County, crossing Wangwu Mountain and Qinling Mountain to Zezhou. It has been verified that this route is passable for mules and camels, but field artillery cannot pass. If Shi can facilitate it, Feng will go directly to Shizhuang. (Special Dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Railway Bureau News: Less than 30,000 of Feng's troops have withdrawn to the Xinxiang area. Some have gone on foot from Zhandian Zhongyidian to Qinghua, but the number is yet to be determined. (Special Dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zhangde reports that the Northwest troops retreating in the Xinxiang area are in great disarray. Lu Zhonglin, Sun Liangcheng, and Xu Yongchang have arrived in Xinxiang amidst the retreating troops. Feng will travel from Zhongyidian to Xiuwu Qingxiang to Jiaozuo, with Liu Ji arriving in Jiaozuo first to set up a headquarters. (Special Dispatch from the 7th) (Beiping) Those who came from Zhangde say that the Northwest Army in Zhengzhou cannot retreat to Hebei for the time being because there are no vehicles and supplies are difficult to obtain in Hebei. Lu intends to accept orders from the Central Government in Zhengzhou. (7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the Northwest Army's main force's retreat route (referring to the road through Luoyang to Shaanxi) has been cut off by the Central Army, they plan to cross the Yellow River and gather near Xinxiang. However, because the attitude of Shi Yousan's army in Zhangde, north of Xinxiang, is unclear, it is inconvenient to go north by railway. In the end, they will move westward by land and merge with Feng Yuxiang in Jiaozuo. (United Press Report, 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiong Bin and He Qigong's trip to Shenyang was at the invitation of Zhang Xueliang. After Xiong and He arrived in Shenyang, they represented the opinions of Lu Zhonglin and other generals and discussed with Zhang Yurliang the method of preserving the existing strength of the Northwest Army, but to no avail, and they returned disappointed. (United Press Report, 7th)</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan</h3>
<p>Unwilling for Feng's Army to Enter Shanxi</p>
<p>(Beiping) News from Shizhuang: Yan has politely declined Feng's army's request to go to the southern parts of Shanxi. Yan has moved two regiments of artillery to Fenlingdu in order to prevent Feng's troops from crossing the river. (Special Dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lu Zhonglin is currently proposing to the Central Government that the Northwest Army be allowed to enter Shanxi to resolve the situation. However, the Shanxi faction is making every effort to undermine this movement, and Wang Jingwei is still staying in Taiyuan with his clique. (United Press Report, 7th)</p>
<h3>Chu Xichun's Troops on the Ping-Sui Line Relinquish Defense</h3>
<p>(Beiping) News from PingSui: Chu Xichun has withdrawn to Zhangjiakou, and the Northeast Army is taking over the defense towards Xuanhua. It is said that Yang Yulin's troops will go from Rehe Province to Chahar Province to take over the defense. (Special Dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yan telegraphed the official in Zhangjiakou, stating that if the Northeast Army advances further, he will immediately withdraw from Zhangjiakou and relinquish the provinces of Suiyuan and Chahar. (Special Dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<h3>Ji Hongchang et al. Issue a Circular Telegram</h3>
<p>Leading Troops to Quietly Await Central Government's Disposal Receiving New Military Posts by Order of Chiang (Kaifeng) Ji Hongchang et al. issued a circular telegram stating: All newspaper offices are requested to note that, unfortunately for the Republic of China, since the 19th year of the Republic (1930), wars have been frequent, and they are especially intense now. The fierce fighting has lasted for five months, yet there is no end in sight. The losses to public and private property, and the deaths and injuries of soldiers and civilians, are difficult to calculate, even with clever methods. Who is responsible for this? Who has caused this? Unity had just been achieved, yet it has been lightly destroyed. It is known that separatism will inevitably lead to defeat, yet some willingly act as exemplars of it. Forcing comrades to blindly follow suit is causing great sorrow to the Party and the country, provoking outrage from all over, and causing particular pain to loved ones. The bitterness endured by Hongchang and others, wanting to cry but unable to, has lasted for more than a year. Fortunately, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, with the Central Government's magnanimous spirit, has repeatedly given sincere advice, seeking only national unity and not counting personal grievances. Deputy Commander Zhang in particular, with the intention of calming the situation, has advocated peace and proposed an immediate ceasefire, leaving all national affairs to the disposal of the Central Government. These are all precious rafts to guide us out of迷途(maze of confusion) and gospels to save the country. All of us should be aware, for opportunities are easily lost and the public's wheel is difficult to escape. Now is the time to lay down the butcher knife and cross to the other shore together, thereby reversing the disaster and restoring peace. Hongchang and others, though not talented, respectfully lead all officers and soldiers to follow Deputy Commander Zhang's teachings, quietly awaiting the disposal of the Central Government. Furthermore, we have received Commander-in-Chief Chiang's appointment of Hongchang as Commander-in-Chief of the 22nd Route Army of the Anti-Rebellion Army, Zizhong as Commander-in-Chief of the 23rd Route Army of the Anti-Rebellion Army, and Yinxiang Yunlong as Army Commander, and we have respectfully assumed our posts today. Soldiers consider obedience to orders their duty, but one should not blindly follow orders that undermine unity, for it is a greater honor to die for the Party and the country than to be a futile sacrifice for individual ambitions. Hongchang and others dedicate themselves to the country, vowing to save the people. We can only obey the Central Government, uphold unity, fulfill our responsibilities as ordinary citizens, and uphold the teaching that one should not yield in the face of duty. Whether people know my guilt or commend me, I will leave it to public opinion. I respectfully send this telegram, hoping for your consideration. Ji Hongchang, Zhang Zizhong, Zhang Yinxiang, and Ge Yunlong together send this message. (Special Dispatch from the 7th)</p>

Airmail in Brazil has also been suspended. Martial law has been declared throughout the country. Government warships have sailed south to blockade the rebellious areas.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Brazilian Capital, 6th: The Brazilian revolutionary party announced today that the capitals of Brazil's five major states are under their control. It is reported that the revolutionary forces are spreading rapidly. The states of Ceará and Pará, as well as the northern states, are likely to be invaded. The government has explicitly declared a state of siege throughout the country.</p>

<h3>Romanian Cabinet Resigns En Masse</h3>

<h3>Contents of the British Imperial Conference Kept Secret</h3>
<p>Conservative Newspapers Express Dissatisfaction Pacific News, London, 6th: Some Conservative newspapers have expressed dissatisfaction with the secrecy of the Imperial Conference.

As for the issue of Imperial Defense, these newspapers advocate organizing Imperial Army and Navy forces, because it seems unfair that the British Empire continues to bear most of the Imperial Defense expenses. On the other hand, if the self-governing colonies bear more Imperial Defense expenses, their right to speak on management will inevitably be greater.</p>

<h3>Date of German Parliament Session Approaches</h3>
<p>Political Negotiations Underway</p>
<p>Steel Helmet Party Marches</p>
<p>Strongly Advocates Recovering Ceded Territories</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 6th: With only one week left until the convocation of the new parliament, negotiations on the political situation are proceeding urgently. After President Hindenburg returned to the capital today, Prime Minister Brüning immediately paid a visit to report on the informal contacts with leaders of various parties. The conversation was lengthy, and the content is unknown. Also, the leader of the National Socialist Party, Hitler, also visited the Prime Minister last night with two well-known members of his party to discuss the political situation. However, according to the current situation, the final attitude of various parties towards the cabinet's financial plan may not be clear until the 13th, when the plan is formally submitted to parliament. There is another important development in party issues. The Archbishop of Mainz has sent a letter to his dioceses, formally announcing a ban on Catholics from joining the National Socialist Party, and those who are already members should withdraw from the party, otherwise they will not receive the sacraments. The reason is that Hitler's political program contains principles that violate the Catholic faith. It is expected that other Catholic archbishops in the Rhineland will issue similar announcements soon. However, it is noteworthy that during the National Socialist Party's election campaign, many Christians also joined the activities. Pacific News, Coblenz, 6th: Today, the German "Steel Helmet Party" marched in the city. According to the organizers, more than 120,000 members participated. The leader of the party gave an important speech, strongly arguing that the European peace treaty must be amended immediately, and that the territories ceded by Germany should be returned in full. The German left-wing newspapers reported that the former Crown Prince has joined the Steel Helmet Party.</p>

Retired soldiers formed a guard of honor and took care of the coffins day and night, and those who came to pay their respects walked through the door of the room in an endless stream. Tomorrow morning at 10:00, the bodies will be sent to the cathedral, where a memorial service will be held by the Bovan pastor, and then the coffins will be transported by gun carriage to the station and taken by special train to Caen.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th: Officials have decided to hold a memorial service for the R-101 deceased on October 10 at St. Paul's Cathedral. The coffins will be transported from Boulogne to Dover by two destroyers. According to news from Bovan, the identification of bodies in Aroye is taking longer than expected. Only three of the twenty bodies have been identified.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th: The Air Ministry officially announced that the R-101 airship carried a total of 54 people. 46 bodies have now been found, one person died in the hospital from injuries, and seven people survived, which matches the numbers. The authorities have now sent letters to the families of the deceased, because most of the bodies cannot be identified, suggesting that the bodies be buried in one place, so that a memorial plaque can be placed at the burial site. The approximate location is planned to be in Cardington.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bovan, 7th: Only five of the R-101 disaster victims have been reliably identified, including a man named Potter, who survived the R-38 airship disaster. The members of the investigative committee have now been announced, including eight British experts and four French experts. The captain of the R-100 airship, Booth, is also a member of the committee. It is reported that by counting the skulls, the number of bodies is indeed 46.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bovan, 7th: The coffins of the 47 R-101 victims were transported today by one gun carriage each from the City Hall to the train station. The streets were lined with people watching, all taking off their hats to pay their respects. All banks and most stores were closed today in compliance with the national mourning order. French Prime Minister Tardieu, Air Force Chief Amar, British Ambassador Tyrrell, and many French military and civilian officials walked behind the coffins.</p>
<p>Pacific News, London, 6th: The Air Ministry issued an announcement stating that the large airship R-101 crashed and caught fire near the southern part of Boulogne at approximately 2:00 a.m. A factory employee of the airship manufacturer and seven crew members were rescued after being injured. Rumors that two of the survivors died are absolutely false. The airship used a total of five engines. Although they were suitable for airship use, their weight was increased compared to the original plan, so the airship's power was also weaker than the original plan. Its overall design was not without flaws. The larger the hull, the more difficult it is to steer, and if the frame is weak, the danger is greater. One of the reasons for previous airship disasters was this. The airship's manufacturer had already seen this. The airship was completed in October of last year and ranked first in the world. Its volume was 155,740 cubic meters, and its value was over one million British pounds. Its minimum diameter was 39 meters, and its maximum diameter was 50 meters. Its height was 42 meters. Its lifting power was 155 tons. Its outer layer was made of stainless steel. The bedrooms inside were very spacious, and the dining room could accommodate 50 people. The smoking room was made of fireproof materials. The ship carried four days' worth of food and supplies, which only needed to be replenished after reaching the Suez Canal. After replenishment, it could sail directly to Karachi, India. Its speed could reach 120 kilometers per hour during the voyage. On average, it could reach 100 kilometers per hour.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 6th: Newspapers reported that aviation experts such as Eckler criticized the R-101 disaster, saying that airships should use non-flammable gas instead of light gas. The United States' helium monopoly does not allow helium exports, except for a very limited amount. It is now hoped that the United States will lift this ban. The British government has invited Dr. Eckler to London to present his views on the accident.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 6th: Congressman Britten, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, said today that in light of the loss of the R-101 airship, he will propose allowing the export of helium, specifically for the needs of foreign governments' airships. Political circles believe that exporting helium would deplete the United States' supply, and that helium is a military necessity that the United States uniquely possesses. Providing it to other countries would be tantamount to giving them a weapon.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Plans to Establish Large-Scale Farms</h3>
<p>315,000 Cattle to be Raised</p>
<p>Costing 22 Million Rubles</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 6th: The Armenian Agricultural Committee has decided to establish a very large-scale farm in the Stepanavansky region, where the dairy farm will house 315,000 cattle, producing butter and hard cheese, with an estimated cost of 22 million rubles.</p>
<h3>German Rejuvenation Expert Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Due to the Decline of His Medical Practice</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 6th: German rejuvenation expert Schmid committed suicide today, apparently because his medical practice was affected by the social and economic hardship, and became increasingly decadent, so he embraced pessimism. Mr. Schmid had traveled extensively to various countries, and recently traveled to China, Japan, Siam, and other places, promoting his medical skills.</p>
<p>Important Domestic News</p>
<h3>Record of Wang Shuchang's Visit to Tianjin</h3>
<p>Wang Publishes Speech on Governing Principles</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Wang Shuchang, commander of the Second Northeast Border Defense Army and chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, entered the Pass by special train from Shenyang at 1:40 p.m. yesterday (September 30) and arrived in Tanggu at 12:50 p.m. today. Those who welcomed him at the station included Zhang Jinchen, director of the Tanggu Public Security Bureau, leading a police force, and more than 20 representatives of gentry and merchants. Wang Shuchang was fast asleep in the car and did not wake up. His Chief of Staff Chen Qinruo thanked them on his behalf. Zhang Xueming got out of the car and guided reporters onto the car to talk. He briefly stated that his brother originally planned to take over the Tianjin Public Security Bureau today, but due to the train delay, it was changed to tomorrow. All detailed plans for reforms will be reported after taking office. In simple terms, it is only to seek tranquility and progress for Tianjin and its public security. The press is the voice of the people and should announce a sentence in the newspapers: Citizens should pay attention, my brother is from outside the Pass, but this time, his foothold is completely in Tianjin and on his duty, to work for Tianjin, not for outside the Pass, to work for the country, not for himself. I hope everyone sees me as one of the citizens of Tianjin, and also sees me as serving Tianjin. I only brought three or four people with me to help with the takeover. I very much hope that everyone will contribute their opinions and guidance as much as possible. If it is beneficial to the local people, I will sincerely accept it. Next, he visited Zang Qifang, director of the Tianjin Social Affairs Bureau. According to Zang, Commander Zhang believes that the mayors of Beiping and Tianjin are very important because they are related to national politics and local measures. He plans to appoint those who are excellent in character and learning and meet the public's expectations to serve. Therefore, the selection of candidates is difficult, so he sent his brother to temporarily take care of the matter. All existing personnel will not be changed to ensure familiarity. If there are those who resolutely seek to leave, they must be resolutely retained. Mayor Cui has done a very good job in municipal administration during his term, and the projects that have already been started will continue to be carried out and will never be stopped. Businesses that should be developed and reformed will also be carried out step by step. The affairs of the Social Affairs Bureau are very complicated and there are many opportunities to contact the public. I hope the press will not hesitate to give advice, for which I am very grateful. Furthermore, according to Zeng Guangxiang, director of the Ping Sui Railway Bureau, he will go to Beiping tomorrow to take over the bureau. He heard that the bureau has already taken the archives to Zhangjiakou for office. Such actions are not appropriate. However, without archives, we can still handle things. I have been away from Beiping for a long time, and I do not know the extent of the damage to the railway. How to reorganize it must be determined after the takeover and a comprehensive plan is made. There is nothing I can report at this time.</p>
<h3>Wang Shu-chang, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government</h3>
<p>At 4:40 PM, the special train arrived at Junliangcheng. Wang Shu-chang had already risen. The reporter then presented his card requesting an interview. According to Wang, he arrived in Tianjin today, and will rest for one day tomorrow. The day after tomorrow (the 3rd) at 10:00 AM, he will take office with all the commissioners of the provincial government. The provincial government and all departments will also move back to Tianjin to conduct business. After the central government dispatches a swearing-in officer to Tianjin, a supplementary oath will be taken. Regarding policy guidelines, he will discuss them in detail after taking office. However, before his departure, he consulted with Commander Zhang, and now he can simply report that Commander Zhang, in view of the years of war and the people's livelihood in decline, strongly advocates peace and proposes to end the war. As a man of ordinary talent, he is honored to be in charge of the government of Hebei. He should uphold the commander's intention and first eliminate bandits to allow the people to live and work in peace. The administration of Hebei Province can be said to have not been rectified in recent years. This is not because the provincial authorities lack a sense of responsibility and abandon their duties, but because of the situation and the environment that does not allow for rectification. After he takes office, it will be easy to talk about cleaning up officialdom, rectifying finances, revitalizing industry, and popularizing education, but difficult to implement. He does not want to make empty promises without doing anything. In the future, he will do it step by step, and contribute as much as he can. He is not sure whether he can do it well. The press is an organ representing the people, and he hopes for unreserved guidance, which he will sincerely accept. Over the years, the people of Hebei Province have been waiting for relief from their difficulties, and unreasonable taxes and levies should be exempted. The Chongwenmen Customs in Peiping is a type of double tax, and it is planned to abolish it immediately. The Second Army Command is located inside the Tianjin Garrison Command, and the choice of the garrison commander has not been determined. Chen Xingya's appointment as the commander of the Peiping-Tianjin Gendarmerie is also a proposal and has not yet been finalized. Regarding the commissioners of the provincial government who do not concurrently serve as department heads, no one has been appointed yet. It has not yet been discussed whether the former provincial commissioner Shen Yinmo will be reappointed. Wang Weicheng, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, is the secretary-general of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government and has not yet set off. Commander Zhang will not enter customs in the near future. Although the central government is urging him to take the position of deputy commander of the army, navy, and air force, Zhang is still declining. A second telegram is still under consideration to solicit opinions. He still hopes to turn hostility into friendship based on the Qiao telegram. The Third Army has not yet been organized, and the selection of the army commander has not yet been determined, and so on. At 2:20 PM, the special train arrived at Tianjin East Station. Those who welcomed him at the station included more than ten groups such as the General Chamber of Commerce, various trade associations, the Lu Salt Public Office, the joint office of street and village chiefs and deputy chiefs, and Liu Jinkan, a representative of the municipal government, and Zhao Hengbao, a representative of the Public Security Bureau. Wang Shu-chang got off the train and greeted the welcomers before getting back on the train and heading to the main station. Those who welcomed him at the station included Mayor Cui Tingxian and others. Wang got off the train and went to the military headquarters to rest. In addition to the above-mentioned people, those who arrived in Tianjin on the same train included Liu Hainian, director of the Tianjin Finance Bureau, Tao Jingqian, director of the Public Works Bureau, Ning Xiangnan, director of the Special Second District, Lu Lu, director of the Special Third District, Zhao Manlin, director of the Telegraph Bureau, Wang Tao, director of the Peiping Finance Bureau and acting mayor, Yao Hong, director of the Hebei Provincial Finance Department, Lin Chengxiu, director of the Construction Department, Chang Bingyi, director of the Agriculture and Mining Department, Jing Youyan, financial commissioner, Chai Shiwen, director of the Dagu Shipyard, Shi Wei, director of the Stamp Tax Office, Wu Yintang, director of the Telecommunications Administration, and Bao Zhusun, director of the River Affairs Bureau. Those who arrived in Tianjin on train number 102 at 6:30 this morning included Han Linsheng, superintendent of the Tianjin Customs, Hong Weiguo, salt transport commissioner of Changlu, Wang Shouzhong, director of the Mint, Kang Ruifu, director of the Peiping Telephone Bureau, Bao Yulin, director of the Public Security Bureau, and Ge Guangting, director of the Pinghan Railway Bureau. At 9:00 PM, Gao Jiyi, director of the Beijing-Shenyang Railway Bureau, hosted a banquet at his residence for a group of new dignitaries. It was decided during the banquet that they would take over various agencies at 9:00 AM on the 2nd. Duan Maolan, director of the Telephone Bureau, Chen Hongxin, director of the Special First District, Deng Qinglan, director of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Quan Shaoqing, director of the Health Bureau, were all reappointed. (October 1st)</p>
<h3>Northeastern Takeover of Tianjin Agencies</h3>
<p>Temporarily Held Under the Title of Agent</p>
<p>Pending Appointment by the Central Government</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: Personnel sent by Zhang Xueliang to take over various agencies in Tianjin arrived in Tianjin on the 1st of this month. Starting at 10:00 AM on the 2nd, agencies such as the Municipal Government, Public Security Bureau, Social Affairs Bureau, Finance Bureau, Changlu Salt Transport Commissioner's Office, Tianjin Customs Superintendent's Office, Telegraph Bureau, and Special Third District Public Office were taken over one after another. The Special First and Second District Public Offices were taken over on the morning of the 3rd. However, Tao Jingqian of the Public Utilities Bureau only has a position without a bureau because Tianjin only has a Public Works Bureau, and public utilities are under the jurisdiction of the fourth section of the municipal government. Tao has telegraphed Zhang for instructions on how to handle the situation, and it is possible that he will be reassigned to the Public Works Bureau. Furthermore, Deng Qinglan, the original director of the Education Bureau, Li Rongpei, the director of the Land Bureau, Quan Shaoqing, the director of the Health Bureau, Huang Airu, the director of the Port Affairs Bureau, and Duan Maolan, the director of the Telephone Bureau, all have hopes of being reappointed because their positions are simple and because they have connections with the Northeast. The circumstances of the takeover of each agency are roughly the same. On their inauguration announcements, they all wrote "Entrusted by the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Border Defense Army on September 26, Commission No. X to appoint so-and-so as the agent for a certain position." The word "agent" is used because the formal appointment or commission from the central government has not yet been received. The word "Special" has also been removed from the Tianjin Special Municipal Government to comply with the central government's laws and regulations. The Special First, Second, and Third Districts, which were originally under the jurisdiction of the municipal government, have now been changed</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>to be under the jurisdiction of the Public Security Bureau. The details of the takeover are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Government: At 10:00 AM on the 2nd, the original Mayor Cui Tingxian and various section chiefs and staff members arrived at the government building one after another.</p>
<h3>Acting Mayor Zang Qifang</h3>
<p>Deng Qinglan, the director of the Education Bureau, Li Rongpei, the director of the Land Bureau, Quan Shaoqing, the director of the Health Bureau, and Huang Airu, the director of the Port Affairs Bureau, also arrived at the government building one after another. At 11:00 AM, Zang Qifang, the concurrent acting mayor, and Liu Jinsheng, the original secretary-general of the municipal government, arrived at the government building and entered the auditorium. Cui Tingxian introduced the subordinates to Zang. The mayor's seal was displayed at the ceremony, and Cui handed it over to Zang for acceptance. Zang then gave a speech to the public, saying that he was very grateful to Mayor Cui for introducing him to everyone at the municipal government today. Commander Zhang was carefully looking for a suitable candidate for the position of mayor, and it was difficult to find a suitable person for the time being. He was here temporarily to take care of things. Commander Zhang of the Northeast sent troops to Peiping and Tianjin purely to eliminate the scourge of war and maintain peace. The politics of a city is of great importance to the country. Mayor Cui has been in office for two years, and his achievements have been praised. He is willing to continue Mayor Cui's previous achievements in building Tianjin's municipal administration and continue to work hard. Moreover, he will only be acting as mayor for a very short time, and everyone will be working for a very long time. He hopes that everyone will continue to work as usual. He will never place his own people in positions. From the day he takes office until the day he hands over the position in the future, he will concentrate and work hard to the end. Everyone has many years of experience in municipal administration and will naturally be able to do well. As for the recovery of concessions, the people of the whole country are constantly calling and hoping for it. But he believes that if the municipal administration can be done well and all construction can be done better than the concessions, people who live in the concessions will gradually move back to the Chinese streets. At that time, if the Chinese do not live in the concessions, they will be recovered without being recovered. He hopes that everyone will give him advice on municipal administration from time to time. Although he does not dare to make decisions easily, he will definitely study them carefully and adopt them for implementation. Next, Cui said in his speech that he was very moved by Mayor Zang's speech, which was very sincere. Regarding the personal issues of the various staff members, Mayor Zang has already said that everyone should know that they are working for the Tianjin Special Municipal Government, not for Cui Tingxian personally. Therefore, he hopes that everyone will work hard with peace of mind. If there are important reasons why you have to resign, you must explain it to Mayor Zang and ask for a suitable replacement before leaving your post. This is the right way to do things. You must not leave your post without permission or delay things. If you are an official for a day, you must be responsible for a day. He especially hopes that everyone will work harder than he did when he was in office, because he personally is tired. Now that Mayor Zang has come to lead everyone, you should cheer up and work hard. Mayor Zang has studied municipal administration and has studied in the United States. In the future, there should be achievements that were previously impossible to achieve to satisfy the people's wishes. At 12:00, everyone took a photo together to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau: The original director, Zeng Yanyi, did not go to the bureau to work after the Northeast Army arrived in Tianjin. The new director, Zhang Xueming, arrived at the bureau at 10:00 AM. All the section chiefs and the directors of the five district offices lined up outside the bureau to welcome him respectfully. Zhang arrived at the auditorium and summoned all the personnel for a lecture. He said that today he was taking office, and he would not replace the old staff. If anyone insisted on leaving, he would not force them to stay. Everyone should serve the local area and maintain integrity. Those who can do their best for the public will be promoted. The organization and training of the Tianjin police are the best in the country. They have a reputation as the model police of Beiyang. He hopes to maintain the glory that exists and further promote and expand it. The duty of the police is to protect the people and defend the local area. They should listen to the training of their superiors in order to get on the right track. If anyone is not doing their job well, they will be given appropriate punishment. Zhang had just finished his lecture when congratulations filled the courtyard. There were more than 100 people, including Yao Dongfan, the commander of the 25th Brigade, Bao Zhonglin, the commander of the 23rd Regiment, Bi Luo, the customs commissioner, Bao Zhusun, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, and Fu Baoheng, the deputy director of the Beijing-Shenyang Railway Bureau. Zhang met with them in batches. At 4:00 PM, he took a car to Peiping and planned to return to Tianjin by train early on the 3rd. At 3:00 PM, he attended the ceremony for Wang Shu-chang's assumption of the chairmanship of the provincial government. Zhang announced that more than 60 new officials had arrived, and 40 to 50 more would be announced soon. Secretary-General and Chief of the First Section</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueming, Director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Wu Yixian, Secretary and Chief of the Fourth Section Ning Xiangnan (Director of the Special Second District), Zhao Yunpu, Zhang Guanru, Luo Peixiang, Du Dianyuan, Chief of the Second Section, Sun Shaokang, Chief of the Third Section, Wang Yimin, Chief Instructor, Tao Weiduo and Liu Bailing, Inspectors, Rong Zilong, Chief of Special Affairs, and Wang Xingzhou, Chief of General Affairs.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau: The original director, Liu Jinsheng, arrived at the bureau at 9:00 AM. At 10:00 AM, the new director, Zang Qifang, arrived at the bureau and summoned the staff for a lecture. He said that there was no need to deny that Chinese society needs to be reformed. However, the starting point of the reform plan should be the cities first, and then the rural areas. Urban social undertakings are directly related to the welfare of the people of the whole country. Looking at various countries in the East and West, the evolution of urban society has affected the changes in the entire society. It is no longer a matter of one country, one city, or one era. Now, let me mention a few key points in social administration to discuss with you: (1) Steady progress and persistence. Social evolution comes gradually and cannot be achieved overnight. The bureau should be bold in carrying out improvements in social undertakings, but it must not be impatient in its intentions. As the saying goes, "Haste makes waste." Today, Chinese society has many deep-rooted problems. If we want to carry out reforms, we must first investigate the pathological conditions clearly, and then use the power of the people and the government to design carefully and do it slowly. (2) Approaching the people. The government is established for the people, and the administration of the bureau is directly related to the people. The staff has a lot of contact with the people in their work. In the future, we hope that the undertakings we organize will be empathetic and must go deep into the people and seek progress together. Do not regard ourselves as officials and raise our status. We should regard ourselves as citizens and think and act like that. We must break the bad habits of bureaucracy and strive to approach the people. Only then will Chinese society have the hope of improvement. (3) Setting an example. The administration of the bureau is different from other agencies, and it is responsible for guiding society. If someone is already corrupted, how can they improve society? Finally, I hope that everyone will be clean and self-disciplined, set an example, and be a model for society and the people. I hope we can all encourage each other. If it does not meet this purpose, either I will leave, or the staff will leave.</p>
<p>Salt Transport Commissioner's Office: When the reporter arrived at the Changlu Salt Transport Commissioner's Office at 10:00 AM, the newly appointed commissioner, Hong Weiguo, was giving a lecture to the staff, repeatedly urging them to work with peace of mind. Those with stronger abilities will be promoted. He then told the reporter that when he was the superintendent of Shanhaiguan Customs, he met Lu Yunshi because of the issue of establishing a Qinhuangdao sub-customs at Lu Transport. Now he is here to replace Lu. Lu has not arrived due to illness.</p>
<p>, and Zhang Guokui, the chief of the general affairs section, is responsible for the handover, which will take about two days to complete. He is not very clear about the salt affairs situation, but from his observations over the years, the national salt affairs generally have many malpractices. The most serious malpractice is that the merchants who handle the affairs add water and mud to exploit the food households, which is obvious to everyone. It is hateful to talk about. After he takes office, he will first eliminate the accumulated malpractices, and at the same time step up the crackdown on smuggling. Those who abide by the rules will be rewarded, and those who control and manipulate will be severely punished. Next, we should expand sales and facilitate transportation, and we should adapt to the circumstances and handle them accordingly. As for the sale of salt, official transportation and official sales are not good policies. In the future, it may be changed to official supervision and merchant sales. Jin Yulun has now been appointed as the director of the Lu Salt Tianjin Wu Sixty-one County Yin'an Official Salt Management Office to take over.</p>
<p>In addition, Han Linsheng will take over as the superintendent of the Tianjin Customs, Zhao Manlin will take over as the director of the Telegraph Bureau, and Lu Lu will take over as the director of the Special Third District. Lu will also serve as the director of the Special First District and will take over at 10:00 AM on the 3rd. Ning Xiangnan, director of the Special Second District, will take over at 9:00 AM on the 3rd. Zhu Luyun, sent by the Ministry of Railways, will take over the Jinpu Railway Bureau at 2:00 PM on the 3rd and will still reduce its scope to an office. Giersen, the customs commissioner, will lead the old customs officers to take over at 8:00 AM on the 3rd. The new customs officers will be dismissed with half a month's salary on the 2nd. (October 3rd)</p>
<h3>Jinpu Railway Handles Traffic</h3>
<p>Jinan Communication: She Xu, the chief of the Traffic Department of the Jinpu Railway Administration, came to Jinan yesterday to handle traffic matters. The reporter visited She at the construction room of the Jinan Station of the Jinpu Railway at 10:00 AM this morning (the 4th) and asked about the traffic on the Jinpu Railway and the revenue of the vehicles. She Xu gave the following statement:</p>
<p>Traffic Issues: Regarding the issue of full traffic on the Jinpu Railway, the central government and the Northeast have reached a compromise. He came north this time to handle traffic matters and will go to Dezhou tomorrow (the 5th). It is not yet certain whether he will go north from Dezhou. The most difficult thing now is the lack of vehicles. The Jinpu Railway had four large locomotives, three small reversing locomotives, thirty passenger cars, and seventy freight cars in Tianjin. He does not know if they are all still there at the moment. According to a telegram from Tianjin on the 1st, the Jin army must send the Jinpu Railway's vehicles to Shanxi in order to transport troops. The Jinpu Railway employees believed that if the vehicles were taken away, there would be no way to get through in the future, and it would be difficult to maintain food, so they repeatedly begged the Jin army not to take the vehicles away, but there was no result. Later, he also met with the Northeast Army officers stationed in Tianjin and asked them to mediate, but the Northeast Army was reluctant to interfere because they had just exchanged defenses with the Jin army in Tianjin and had no orders. Therefore, the railway employees broke with the Jin side and almost came to blows. They dismantled all the engine wheel parts and screws to resist and avoided meeting to avoid being forced to drive. Zhu Luyun, the deputy director of the Jinpu Railway, arrived in Tianjin on the 2nd, but the Jin personnel refused to hand over because they claimed that they had to hand over to the Northeast Army, so Zhu has not yet taken over the bureau. In short, full traffic on the Jinpu Railway will have to wait until the Northeast Army takes over the various agencies before it can be handled.</p>
<p>Vehicle Situation: Before the war broke out, the Jinpu Railway had more than 500 passenger and freight cars each, and more than 70 locomotives. Last summer, Feng Yuxiang's army pulled away 400 passenger and freight cars and 21 locomotives. When Tang Shengzhi rebelled, the vehicles disappeared. Last winter, when Shi Yousan's incident occurred, he also took away 300 vehicles and 20 locomotives, which also disappeared. Therefore, it is difficult to talk about reorganizing the Jinpu Railway now. We must wait until the military affairs are settled before we can start. At present, the vehicles used by the General Headquarters, in addition to the five trains originally on the Longhai Railway, have also borrowed 600 vehicles and 18 locomotives from the Jinpu Railway. Qian Zongze, the transportation commander, telegraphed last month that he would return the vehicles in batches, with the ratio of Longhai and Jinpu being one to two. For example, if Longhai returns one train, Jinpu will return two trains. However, due to busy military transportation, only six trains have been returned recently. The Jinpu Railway currently has four passenger trains and three freight trains, totaling nine trains, including others. There are 200 cars of all sizes, seven passenger car locomotives, and nine freight car locomotives, excluding the six new returned trains.</p>
<p>Revenue Situation: The revenue of the Jinpu Railway in the previous two months was very small, and it was very difficult to pay the salaries of the employees. After the military authorities recently returned six trains, the average daily revenue from transporting accumulated goods along the way was 20,000 yuan, which was enough to pay the employees' salaries, but there was no surplus to purchase materials to repair the tracks, bridges, and vehicles.

<h3>He Yingqin Arrives in Jiangxi from Wuhan</h3>
<p>Convenes a Military Conference</p>
<p>Determines the Communist Suppression Plan</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: He Yingqin, the director of the Wuhan Headquarters and the commander-in-chief of the Communist suppression in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, believes that the Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang bandit gangs have fled to the Xinyu and Qingjiang areas and must be eliminated as soon as possible. Therefore, he came to Jiangxi from Wuhan to inspect everything and give instructions to Commander Lu and Division Commander Zhang. On the 2nd of this month, Lu received a telegram from He, stating that he would come to Jiangxi on the 3rd, but was postponed to 10:00 AM on the 5th. Fang took the Xiangjiang water plane to the province. Before He arrived in the province, the heads of various agencies in the city, the leaders of various groups, and the military officers above the regimental commander level gathered at the riverbank of the Mint outside Zhang on the morning of the 5th to welcome him. Those who arrived included Commander Lu, Division Commanders Zhang and Yue, all members of the provincial party headquarters and the provincial government, the Ninth Route Army Headquarters, the 18th Division Headquarters, all officers of the Garrison Command, and more than 1,000 representatives from various industrial, commercial, and academic groups from the provincial government and below. At 10:30 AM, they saw a plane flying from north to south along the Nanxun Road, circling the city once, and then landing in the river outside Zhang. He then disembarked from the water plane amidst the melodious music and shook hands with Lu, Zhang, and other dignitaries. He then took a car with Lu, Zhang, and others to the provincial government, but the security along the way was extremely tight.</p>
<p>After resting at the provincial government, He convened a military conference at 12:00 to discuss all communist suppression plans. Those present included Lu Dipin, Zhang Huizan, Gong Bingfan, Yue Sen, and Lu Xiaochen, among others. First, Lu and Zhang reported on the recent bandit situation, the deployment of the various armies, and the defense work in the provincial capital, and presented various telegrams, charts, and tables. Then, they discussed the allocation of troops and the strategy of attack and defense one by one. The meeting lasted for two hours before it ended. After the military conference ended, the provincial government immediately held a banquet in the Xiyuan Hall to welcome He. During the banquet, Lu gave a welcome speech, He gave a reply, and Provincial Party Member Liu and others gave speeches. After the banquet, He had a long private conversation with Lu, Zhang, and Gong. Then, at about 3:00 PM, he took a car to the airport outside Zhang and boarded the Xiangjiang to return to Wuhan.

<h3>Xiamen British Concession Land Ownership Issues</h3>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Secret Agent Continuously Solves Kidnapping Cases The Fengjing Township in this county is located at the intersection of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and borders Jinshan and Qingpu. The numerous waterways make it a den for bandits. Kidnapping cases occur from time to time. In the case of Yin Xietai's kidnapped child in Jiaodiao Bay, the secret agent Yang Shijie of the Military Police Inspection Office captured the bandit woman Wu Lushi in Shanghai. After recovering the kidnapped child, the secret agent interrogated her, and she confessed that a bandit named Shen A'san was still hiding in Shanghai. On the 4th, he led secret agents Tang Shuqin, Lu Shounan, and Shen Shoulin to Shanghai and arrested the bandit Shen in Fu'an Lane, Qipu Road. He also transported the kidnapped Shen women and two young children back to Songjiang by the second shift train. After interrogation, it was learned that Shen A'san was the duck herder Shen A'san from Shenjiabang. He was the mastermind behind every kidnapping case near Fengjing. According to his confession, on the 18th of last month, he kidnapped Shen Renru from Nansugang, Shihudang. The next day, the kidnapped victim escaped due to the guard falling asleep. He then went to Bushi Village and kidnapped a Luo boy (nine years old) and returned. According to the Shen woman, she was kidnapped and did not know the details. The secret agent also captured Xie Yunlian, who was involved in the kidnapping case, in Xinzhen, Fengjing. He confessed that on February 13th, he and his accomplice Lu Jinzhou kidnapped the son of Zhu Xinlong from Shangnanbang. Lu brought him to my house, and I received 26.5 yuan. In early May, I and Jia Zixiang delivered three guns to a bandit nearby. On the same day, in the Shijing area, he captured Shen Yin'an, a bandit who rowed the boat for Taibao A'shu. According to his confession, he disembarked at Bainiudang. He also discovered an abandoned boat left by the bandits in Jiangjiabang and took it back to the office for investigation. Yesterday (the 6th), Agent Yang, based on a tip, immediately led agents to Shanghai. He arrested Tao Yunsheng, nicknamed A'pi, in a smoking den in the French Concession, who had repeatedly committed kidnapping cases. The kidnapped victims of Wanliangjing were hidden in South Chengdu Road. He arrested Qian Longxiu, the bandit guarding the hostages, and rescued Shen Genbu's grandson A'shui (six years old) and Chu Jinkui's son A'xiao (eight years old). Both children, along with the two bandits, were taken back by train that night. The results of the interrogation will be used to search for guns in a certain place and to hunt down the remaining bandits. The above captured bandits will be sent to the county government tomorrow for interrogation.</p>

<p>Large Number of Refugees Passing Through Yesterday (the 7th), more than 300 refugees arrived in Suzhou from Kunshan, passing through Waikuatang and then heading towards Wujiang.</p>
<p>High Court Orders Counties to Guard Against Prisoners The President of the High Court, Lin, stated that recently, reactionary elements have frequently engaged in subversive activities. In all county prisons, communist criminals are mixed in with ordinary prisoners, and the number of escaped prisoners is increasing every month. Given the current unsettled situation, counties should be ordered to be vigilant at all times. Therefore, yesterday (the 7th), he specifically ordered the wardens and prison guards of all counties to be vigilant to avoid negligence.</p>
<p>High Court Thoroughly Investigates Sun Zuji's Bribery Case Former Wuxi County Magistrate Sun Zuji, upon leaving office, allegedly bribed prison guards to release prisoners, leading citizens such as Zhang Tong of the county to submit petitions to the High Court and the Provincial Government, requesting a thorough investigation. Yesterday, the High Court Prosecutor's Office replied that the Wuxi County District Court Prosecutor's Office has been ordered to investigate and handle Sun Zuji's bribery and release of prisoners according to the law.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Continued News of Lake Bandits Robbing Two Steamers Further news indicates that the Zhaoshangju's Xinjiangcheng steamer and the Yangxian Company's Guoshan steamer were robbed by bandits on the way from Liuyang to Wuxi at Jiulikou (also known as Penglikou) the other day. Thirteen men and women were kidnapped as hostages. That night, the two steamers were released. Upon receiving the report, Wang Yunwu, the head of the Yixing Chamber of Commerce branch, immediately led members of the Chamber of Commerce and the militia to cooperate with the garrison troops and pursue the bandits by steamer. By noon, they pursued them to Zhukui Bridge and learned that the bandits had dispersed in all directions, with only a few remaining in the mountains. The kidnapped men and women were also being watched. Chief Wang immediately led the militia members to search the mountains and engaged the bandits. The two sides opened fire for half an hour. The bandits, unable to withstand the attack, abandoned the hostages and fled over the mountains, scattering in all directions. The pursuit continued to Linghukou, where the borders of Jiangsu and Zhejiang meet, where they boarded the bandit ship moored there and fled into the lake. Chief Wang rescued the kidnapped men and women.</p>
<p>Sixteen Silk Factories in Wuxi Close The silk reeling industry in Wuxi has not yet achieved its goal of opposing public weighing. The silk market is sluggish, and the factories are losing too much money, making it difficult to maintain operations. After a meeting of all the industry, it was decided to suspend operations uniformly, following the example of Shanghai. The other day was the abolished Mid-Autumn Festival, and the factories still closed down as usual. Starting yesterday, most factories have already closed down. Some factories have had to clear their inventory at a painful loss due to silk transactions. The following is a list of the closed factories, based on available information: Dafeng (next to Zhang Yuan'an), Yingyi (Beixin Bridge), Didayu (Zhoushanbang), Yifeng (outside Guangfu Gate), Sanxin (Sheqiao Head), Jintai (Nanxiatang), Taifu (Tatangxia), Santai (Pinggang Bridge), Yusheng (Tieshu Bridge), Ruifu (Yanggu Bay), Defeng (Jingou Bridge), Yisheng (Lixin Road), Yonghengfeng (Sheqiao Head), Yongyu (Xinglong Bridge), Zhenyicheng (Qingming Bridge), Yuanfeng (Beixin Bridge). A total of sixteen factories.</p>
<p>Two Robbery Cases Occur in Urban and Rural Areas in One Day Recently, robbery cases have occurred frequently in urban and rural areas of this county, causing great concern about public security. Unexpectedly, two more robbery cases occurred yesterday. The following is a record of the events: (1) Two men from Wujin, Wu Ronggao and Gao Bingsheng, had finished transporting pigs in Suzhou and were returning in their empty pig transport boat yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM. As they approached the Wudian Bridge near Jingyun City in the Second District of this county, four bandits suddenly called out to swing the boat over. Wu and Gao did not understand their meaning and immediately brought the boat ashore. The bandits jumped onto the boat. Unexpectedly, once inside the small river, the bandits overturned the cabin, robbing the pig transport fee of 18 yuan and fleeing ashore. The incident was immediately reported to the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, which dispatched police to the countryside and captured two suspects, Xu Genrong and Huang Xinggen, who were taken back to the bureau for interrogation. (2) The home of Gao Rongsheng, a villager from Gaoxiang in the Seventh District (Huai Shang City), was suddenly invaded by more than ten bandits the other night, who broke into the house and searched at will. They robbed 130 yuan in cash, 70-80 pieces of clothing, and gold jewelry worth about 300 yuan. Gao Rongsheng was burned on the arm by the bandits, and Gao's elderly mother was beaten all over with hard firewood sticks. The incident has been reported to the district office for submission to the county government, which has ordered a search.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Detective Team to Be Disbanded The position of captain of the Jiangyin Detective Team has been held by Huang Bingzhong since he was dismissed for the Hongwan case, then temporarily by Huang Jinbiao, and then again by Wu Shanbao. However, cases of banditry have continued to emerge, and none have been solved. Now, County Magistrate Li has decided to disband the detective team on the 5th, deeming it a waste of public funds.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Strictly Handles Jiang Hong Case Former director of the Relief Institute Jiang Hong, for Ji Hehua, was confirmed by County Magistrate Li as having obtained 5,000 yuan from Ji's parents in the name of the county government, with 3,000 yuan used to purchase guns for the Public Security Bureau and 2,000 yuan used for the Relief Institute's medical clinic, implying fraudulent intent. He has been arrested and detained, and Ji's mother, Sha, has been designated as the plaintiff for a thorough investigation. During the interrogation the other day, Jiang Hong stated that the 5,000 yuan had been approved by County Magistrate Li and that he had only acted as an intermediary, with someone named Mei handling the funds. He claimed that he had not directly received the funds and that Ji's mother had personally come to the city to request the rescue of her son, and that he had no intention of obtaining funds under false pretenses. County Magistrate Li absolutely denied Jiang's statements, stating that he should be dealt with strictly according to the law. The outcome of this case is unknown.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Detailed Account of Prison Break at Detention Center At 5:10 PM on the 6th, a large number of important criminal defendants escaped from the detention center affiliated with the Jiangdu County Court. The general situation was reported in yesterday's special dispatch column. The following is a detailed account of the prison break: The Yangzhou Detention Center is located inside the Jiangdu County Government compound. Outside the detention center, a squadron of police troops is stationed. The other day, 30 of the more combat-capable troops were transferred to Luyang Lake to suppress bandits, leaving the defense weak. The 6th was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the escaped prisoners, knowing that there were few defenders and that most of the guards were newly replaced, prepared a large amount of wine and meat and held a public feast for the guards. A few prisoners who had not been shackled accompanied them in heavy drinking, while the rest secretly broke their shackles inside the prison. By the time they had mutually broken free, most of the guards were already drunk. In addition, Chen, the head of the detention center, also went to visit Slender West Lake with relatives and friends because it was the Mid-Autumn Festival, so the situation was uncontrollable once it erupted. When the prisoners broke out, they first used their bed boards as weapons, and upon exiting the prison gate, they seized four quick-firing rifles from the police team's fence and rushed out, overwhelming the county government's gate guards. Two of the gate guards were injured. The escaped prisoners fled mostly through the West Gate (because the county government is close to the West Gate). It is estimated that 59 important prisoners escaped. Later, the brigade, police team, and public security bureau successively recaptured ten prisoners, including Zheng Desheng, Xie Jiangxin, Sheng Qichang, Chen A'san, Xian Yuyuan, Xu Ziming, Wang Xiaoliuzi, Cui Lunhua, Zhou Wenhui, and Zhang Fengkui. Chen Churuo was killed in a firefight at Jimaozhuang outside the West Gate. The rest were not found. After the incident, the city gates were closed, and a temporary curfew was announced. However, many people had left the city to visit scenic spots that day and were mostly stranded outside the city. Chen, the head of the detention center, did not enter the city until this morning.</p>
<p>Also, according to a Suzhou dispatch, the High Court received a telegram from the Jiangdu County Court yesterday (the 7th) stating that 56 prisoners escaped from the court's detention center at Shenshi on the 6th. One prisoner was killed on the spot, and eight were captured. President Lin, upon receiving the telegram, immediately dispatched judicial commissioner Gu Douyin to thoroughly investigate and report. It is also said that the reason for the escape of prisoners from the Jiangdu County Court detention center was that the 6th was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the guards were somewhat negligent, which led to the incident.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Li Mingyang Cables to Investigate Surrendered Bandits and Communists In the past month, many Wang bandits and communists in Tongzhou, Rudong, Taixing, and Haian counties have surrendered to the government troops. Rosters are being compiled and submitted to the province for verification. Li Mingyang has cabled from Yancheng, ordering the county magistrates to quickly investigate and report.</p>
<p>Methods for Harvesting Cotton in the Huainan Reclamation Area The Huainan coastal reclamation area has been occupied by large groups of sea bandits, causing employees to flee and making it impossible to harvest cotton. Now, Shen Guanxi's gang has been driven back by the provincial security regiment. Representatives from various districts gathered in Tongcheng to discuss methods for harvesting cotton and resolved to quickly organize a joint militia to protect the tenant farmers in harvesting cotton. A telegram was also sent to the provincial government appealing for assistance. The Civil Affairs Department ordered Xiong Yanghe, the police captain of Funing County, to dispatch troops to assist. Employees and tenants of various companies in Tongcheng have successively gone to the Yanfu reclamation area.</p>
<p>Implementing Rural Pacification in Bandit Areas The areas of Nantong with the deepest banditry, such as Siyu and Pingchao, have been approved by the county government to implement rural pacification, with a period of three months. The Rural Pacification Bureau is attached to the county government, with the county magistrate and the head of the Public Security Bureau as the director and deputy director, respectively. Below them is a rural pacification director, without the establishment of additional departments.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Large Numbers of Refugees Disturb Shanlian and Shichong In Shanlian Town, Wuxing County, Huzhou, over four hundred refugees suddenly arrived, claiming to be from Baoqing County, Henan, in a very miserable state. Led by their representative, Li Zhonghan, they walked from Lianshi to Shanlian and resided in the Xida Temple in the town. The back of the temple is the site of the Shanlian Elementary School in the Fourth District of Wuxing County. After the refugees arrived in Shanlian, only a local police officer was able to manage them, causing the town's shops and the school site to be disrupted. The next day, the refugees left Shanlian and passed through Shichong, staying overnight in the Taijun Temple in the village. They then went out to collect firewood and forcefully took taro, chickens, ducks, and other items from the villagers. Any resistance resulted in violence, causing unrest among the nearby residents. It is reported that the wealthy Shen family in the East Village of Shanlian was invaded by the refugees the other day, who searched the inner rooms and robbed cash, jewelry, clothing, and other items worth no less than 2,000 yuan. Afterward, Shen requested the town's militia to pursue them, but due to the small number of militiamen, they feared being outnumbered and dared not pursue.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Sea Bandit Li Qihe Executed by Firing Squad Li Qihe, alias Li Shunhai, alias Li Lao Zhu (from Linhai), 26 years old, who had previously robbed merchant ships in the waters of Zhapu and was captured and sent to the county, was sentenced to death by the county government due to the severity of his crimes and the sentence was submitted to the province for approval. On the 6th, a telegram was received from the province approving the execution by firing squad. The execution was carried out by police dispatched by the county government at the Wanchang School Grounds outside the South Gate at 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Land Bandit Commander Ying Mentioned to He Qian Changxing Militia Commander Zhang Minggao, when ordered to suppress bandits last year, actually led his troops with weapons into Taihu Lake and joined the bandits. The provincial government had issued a reward for his arrest. Zhang was residing in Shanghai. The Jiangsu Water Police Third District Office learned of this and dispatched troops to Shanghai to cooperate with the French Concession police in capturing the bandit. He was sent to the district office for investigation. Hang Yi, the Jiahu Bandit Suppression Commander, stated that the bandit had disrupted the Zhejiang border in several cases and prepared a document to dispatch Adjutant Zhang Lianfeng to lead a squad to Suzhou to retrieve the bandit from the Water Police Third District Office and bring him back to He, where he is being held at the Bandit Suppression Command for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Economic Oppression Leads to Double Suicide In Zhuangjia Village outside the South Gate of Xiaoshan, there was a man named Lu Xiuhong, who made a living as a small vendor. He lived with only his elderly wife and had no children. In recent years, rice and firewood have become expensive, making it difficult to make a living. He borrowed money from all sides, increasing his debt. The recent festival season also brought many debt collectors, and Lu was unable to cope. He conceived a desperate plan. Last night (the 5th), Lu Xiuhong and his wife both hanged themselves. Neighbors only found out this morning, and it was too late to save them.</p>
<p>Shops' Festival Accounts Collected Less This year, the provincial government stipulated that the 9th of May, September, and December were the deadline for shops to collect accounts. However, shops in Xiaoshan have not changed their old habits and continue to use the Mid-Autumn Festival season to collect accounts from debtors. However, this year's festival accounts were very meager. It is estimated that the shops collected less than half of the accounts owed.</p>
<p>Request to Allocate Dike Engineering Fees The Xiaoshan County Government reported to the Construction Department that the dike project in the Hechangda Third Township is extremely important and cannot be delayed any longer. It requested the transfer of a letter to the Shatian Bureau requesting the advance allocation of 10,000 yuan in construction funds for use. It is learned that the Construction Department has sent a letter to the Shatian Bureau requesting the advance allocation of 10,000 yuan to meet the urgent need and ordered Xiaoshan County to raise the one-quarter of the expenses to be borne by the three townships within one week for construction use.</p>
<p>Incoming Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from Changshu County Government</h3>
<p>Respectfully, I recently read the article "Firefight Between Police and Bandits at the Border of Yu and Cheng" in the local correspondence column of your newspaper on October 2nd. It is inconsistent with the facts. Shizhuang belongs to the jurisdiction of Jiangyin and is not at the border with our county. Furthermore, the Jiangyin Fortress Command did not notify our county to dispatch troops to join in the suppression. Such reports may cause misunderstandings among the people and have a great impact on local public security. Please publish a letter to correct this and clarify the facts. Changshu County Government, respectfully, October 4th</p>
<p>Educational News Highlights</p>

<h3>Representatives of Ten Zhejiang Provincial Middle Schools Go to the Province to Demand Outstanding Payments</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial No. 10 Middle School has been renovated since the beginning of the semester. The school buildings have been repaired, and a new wireless telephone has been installed for practical training of science students. New fire engines have been purchased to prevent fire alarms. Students are studying diligently, and teachers and staff are doing their best. Both senior and junior high school students have established self-government associations, published weekly and monthly magazines, and organized consumer cooperatives. On the faculty and staff side, book clubs, Party Theory Research Society, soccer teams, tennis teams, and basketball teams have been organized. It has recently been learned that the school has been overdue in receiving provincial funds for four months. Student fees have been used up, and teachers and staff are pawning their belongings to make ends meet. They are working for the public on empty stomachs, which cannot last long. The principal has repeatedly telegraphed the province, but to no avail. It is becoming difficult to cope, and the school is about to run out of funds. Therefore, all teachers and staff held a temporary meeting the other day and resolved to send representatives to the province to demand the outstanding payments. Jin Bixian and Chen Guangzeng were elected as representatives of all teachers and staff to demand the outstanding payments.</p>

The school filing must wait until the Ministry of Education sends someone to inspect it before it can be reviewed and approved.</p>
<h3>Hunan Province Re-requests Complete Independence of Education Funding</h3>
<p>and Plans for Future Education Changsha Correspondence: After the recent devastation of Hunan Province by the communists, the education community suffered heavy losses. Education funds have been temporarily advocated by the government. Salt tax revenue has decreased sharply compared to before. Schools that have not been burned down are mostly stationed by troops, and public and private property has been damaged in countless numbers. Although half a month's funding has been distributed at the request of people in the education community and schools have reopened one after another, there is no guarantee for previous arrears and future funding given the current state of the government. The reason for this recurring phenomenon is that education funding is not completely independent. Therefore, the Provincial Education Association convened an executive committee meeting at 4:00 PM on the 1st. More than ten people, including Hu Yiru, attended. Fang Kegang chaired the meeting, reported the purpose of the meeting, and then discussed various proposals below: (1) How should we request the government to maintain the original plan for the complete independence of education funding in this period? It was resolved to send a letter to the Education Department, asking them to be responsible for negotiating with the salt transport bureau to request that the education funding under the salt tax item for July, August, and September be allocated in full to the Education Funding Guarantee Committee, and to request the government to expedite the issuance of the funding for July, August, and September according to the original budget. If the provincial treasury does not have enough to issue, please withdraw a portion from the deposit item of the Education Funding Guarantee Committee for temporary advance payment. (2) Please ask the Education Department to revise the charter of the Education Funding Management Committee to seek complete independence. It was resolved to submit a special proposal to the Education Department for implementation. (3) How should post-disaster education be planned and carried out? It was resolved: (A) To submit a report to the Education Department to announce the post-disaster education facility plan. (B) To publish notices soliciting opinions from education institutions and school administrators in various cities. (C) To designate executive committee members of the association to be responsible for drafting the following education plans: (1) Primary education, (2) Secondary education, (3) Vocational education, (4) Normal education, (5) Public education. (6) Strengthen the work of eliminating communists. It was resolved to ask the secretary-general to draft a plan and submit it to the executive committee for approval and implementation. (5) Please submit a report to the provincial government to repair Zhongshan Hall in advance to avoid greater losses over time. It was resolved to send a document to the Education Department today requesting the provincial government to repair it in advance. (6) The communists have looted the country, and the National Government has specially issued 100,000 yuan in national currency to comfort the people of Changsha. Our education community has suffered huge losses. How should we request the government to distribute it quickly and evenly? It was resolved to consult with the city chamber of commerce in advance to formulate a plan and then negotiate with the Provincial Relief Committee. (7) Send a letter to the charity association requesting the allocation of a portion of funds to maintain post-education funding. It was resolved to pass the motion as is. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Shandong Provincial Government Raises Funds for Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>Jinan Quick News: He Siyuan, member of the Shandong Provincial Government and Director of the Education Department, stated that Shandong owes a huge amount of funding for studying abroad in the East and the West. As of the end of September, it had reached 147,892.3 yuan and urgently needs to be raised as soon as possible to support the scholars studying abroad. Therefore, he submitted a detailed list of the funding for studying abroad in the East and the West to the sixth political affairs meeting of the provincial government for discussion. It was resolved to order the finance department to allocate funds as appropriate and handle the procedures according to previous practice. The proposal is recorded below. Report from the Secretariat: The Education Department submitted a list of outstanding funding for studying abroad in the East and the West for review. How should it be handled? Please make a public decision. The Education Department reported that it had been ordered to investigate and report the amount of funding owed to students studying abroad. It has been found that as of the end of September of this year, a total of 147,892.3 yuan in national currency is owed for studying abroad in the East and the West. A list and inventory are attached for review. In addition, the various amounts listed in the table are calculated based on recent market prices. Recently, the value of gold coins in various countries has fluctuated, and if there is insufficient funding during the remittance, a request will be submitted for review and supplement. As for the remittance fee, because it fluctuates with the price of gold, it is impossible to predict in advance. It is proposed that when allocating funding for studying abroad, it should be calculated according to the market price and submitted for approval. How should it be handled? Please make a public decision. Attached is a list and inventory (omitted).</p>

<h3>Hubei Province Holds Sports Competition</h3>
<p>Huang Jianzhong, Director of the Education Department of Hubei Province, initiated sports competitions for various schools, emphasizing practicality. The following is a record of his instructions and methods:</p>
<p>Instructions: It is noted that sports competitions should not focus on form but on spirit, and not on spirit but on universality. Often, schools hold sports meets with extravagance and waste of money, with only selected athletes participating in running and jumping, completely losing the meaning of sports, and wasting the spirit and time of learning. Thinking of this, I am deeply saddened. The intention of this provincial student sports competition is to eliminate the accumulated bad habits of the past and establish a more progressive method. All extravagance that easily leads to extra classes and waste is eliminated, and exercises that are not suitable for the season or physiology are generally discarded. Emphasis is placed on group competitions, striving to make young students tend towards group discipline in order to eliminate the accumulated ills of abnormal development and cultivate the spirit of loving the group and cooperating. Consider the promotion of sports education to achieve universality. In addition to separate instructions, all schools should first promote universal sports education, group disciplinary action, and, in particular, adhere to the spirit of sports in order to develop education and participate in this competition as much as possible. This is of utmost importance. Attached is one copy of the Hubei Provincial Student Sports Competition regulations and one copy of the group teaching materials.</p>
<p>Regulations: The key points of the competition regulations are recorded below. All provincial schools at all levels and private schools that have been registered can participate in the competition. The competition is divided into the following groups according to the nature and level of the school: Group A University and Specialty Group, Group B High School Group, Group C Junior High School Group, Group D Girls' Group (middle school girls), and Group E Primary School Group (co-ed gymnastics group). The competition events are stipulated as follows: Group A Gymnastics, (1) Freehand Exercises, (2) Military Exercises, (3) Boy Scout Performance, Group B Ball Sports (1) Soccer (2) Basketball (3) Mini-Soccer (4) Volleyball (5) Baseball (6) Tennis. When participating in the competition, schools will generally send representatives to participate in preliminary competitions in accordance with the time, location, and order of competing schools determined in the preliminary schedule. At the end of the preliminary competition, a final competition will be held on a scheduled basis. The final competition will be the Hubei Provincial Student Sports Competition, which must be held no later than November 1st. Therefore, all preliminary competitions should be completed before November 5th.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Seafarer</p>
<p>Barber (teaching a new apprentice): "In our business, the first thing is to be polite. When you see a customer, always put on a smiling face and say a few words to compliment him."</p>
<p>Apprentice: "Master, I can do that. But if I see a bald customer, how should I compliment him?"</p>
<p>Barber: "You say, 'Sir, your hair is too long. Would you like a trim?'"</p>
<p>Police officer (sees a child crying by the river): "Little friend, what's wrong?"</p>
<p>Child (still crying, pointing to the middle of the river): "My brother—"</p>
<p>Police officer (interrupting, jumps into the river. After a while) brings up a hat. "What's this? Your brother is not in the river."</p>
<p>Child: "My brother wasn't originally there. He threw my hat into the river and ran away. I hadn't finished speaking. Why are you in such a hurry?"</p>
<p>Lecturer (raising his head, speaking eloquently) suddenly stops, seeing a young man next to him yawning. "Hey, comrade, you're tired of listening to such an energetic lecture?"</p>
<p>Young man: "I'm not listening. Look around, the audience has already left. I'm just waiting for you to finish so I can sweep the floor, wipe the table, and lock the door."</p>
<h3>Nostalgic Notes from Zhu'an</h3>
<p>— Da Ke</p>
<p>The golden wind rises suddenly, and the jade dew is slightly scattered. Among the clumps of osmanthus trees, there are melancholy thoughts. Within three hundred li, the most famous place for osmanthus trees is Hangzhou's Manjuelong and my Jiahe's Zhuan. Manjuelong is known for its abundance, and Zhuan for its antiquity. Both are scenic spots in fragrant forests. Zhuan is located about ten li southeast of Jiahe City. Taking a boat from Xuan Gong Bridge, passing Nanhus, and along Changshuitang, one can reach it after about a meal's time. Twin osmanthus trees stand tall by the eaves. One is over two zhang tall, and the other is over one zhang tall. Both are hundreds of years old. Some say they were planted by Zhu Wenge Gong of the Ming Dynasty. After checking the Baoshu Ting Collection, there is no record of this. It is probably untraceable. The nunnery worships Garan. The nuns who run it are scattered due to wars and disasters. The halls are also about to collapse. Jin Xiangyan of the village donated funds to repair it, and it was restored to its former glory. In the mid-autumn of the year Wuchen, I, together with Xiangyan, Guo Heting and the Qiting brothers, invited Zhu Qiangcun Yanzhang, Liu Zuquan Cibifu and his son, Yao Yuqin, Yan Qizhou, and other gentlemen to take a boat trip. At that time, Lin Tiezun was in charge of the salt tax in Jiahe, and he was happy to come when he heard about it. Ten people, hosts and guests, lingered all day. Heting hand-painted a map of Zhuan's visit to the osmanthus trees to record the footprints. Xiangyan and others composed poems and lyrics, which were inscribed on the back of the scroll. They boasted of it as a gathering of elegance at the time. Looking back at the west wind, three years have passed in a hurry. Xiangyan passed away last winter. I am also running around for food and clothing, with no interest. Occasionally, I open the old map and feel sad. Among the inscriptions in the map, Qiangweng was the first to write, followed by Tie Lao. The two gentlemen are contemporary Zhou Jiang, and their reputation as masters of lyrics is well-established. I am not modest, and I also composed a tune of Osmanthus Branch Fragrance. Qiangzhang said it was like Wang Banshan's work. The predecessors' praise is deeply ashamed. It is attached here to serve as a call from the hermits of Xiaoshan. Qiangweng's Good Things Close says, "Leaving the world, Guanghan immortals, the fragrant world opens another toad door. Outside the constant sands robbery, compare the moon to the ancient pine on the plate. (Note: At Tiancheng Temple on Panshan) The colored body does not hinder being covered in yellow silk, and crushed gold cloth covers the ground. Even if the poor eaves are exhausted, offer bamboo shoots and axes." Tie Weng's Night Flying Magpie says, "Heavenly fragrance degrees Yun Yun, golden millet piled into heaps of flowers and leaves surging beside the lotus platform. Swaying and scattered Guanghan shadow, Juan Juan Chan mirror deeply open. Kou Dian baskets seem to carry the cover, it is expected to push the southern room to hide. Broken dreams come back for the first time, and after the bell sounds, accompany Vimalakirti for a hundred years of cold ashes. Clear tears from the dew plate disappear, the old fragrant forest of golden medicine. The same as artemisia. The wind outside the red gauze is full of fragrance, and no dust reaches it. Ying Luo lingers. Zhi Qiong has been gone for a long time, and the forehead is yellow with autumn cups. The meaning of osmanthus and Zen, wordless meeting, the moon land comes again." My Osmanthus Branch Fragrance says, "Returning with embrace, taking advantage of maple leaves and reed flowers, the lake is early in autumn. Hearing that the fragrance of osmanthus has not yet arrived, Zen mind is easily annoyed. The Garan is desolate, the bells and fish are cold, and the osmanthus trees are good. After the robbery of the Garden, gold covers the ground, who will sweep it. Don't talk about the literary talent of Huainan, count the joys and sorrows, generally sloppy. Where the lyricists were drunk that day, who can point it out. The yellow-haired people have been gone for years, and the catkins and slanting sun, white-haired old woman. Can't climb and take it. Laugh at me in the wind, the hair is about to grow old.</p>
<h3>A Humorous Anecdote of Mistakenly Swapping Vegetarian and Meat Braided Cords</h3>
<p>— 斅厂</p>
<p>There was a man named Han in Pingyao who still wore a braid. One year on New Year's Eve, Han went to a barber shop nearby for a haircut. After it was finished, he went home to sleep. When he got into bed and coiled his braid, he suddenly realized that his black braided cord had been replaced with a white one. He was very angry and rushed to the barber shop to question them. The barber was the shop owner, Jin. Jin was stunned when questioned, but then he realized that the white braided cord belonged to another customer who was there at the time. Jin had mistakenly tied the white braided cord onto Han's braid because he was tired late at night. When Han returned, the other customer was still getting his hair cut in the shop. Jin, realizing his mistake, quickly apologized to Han and replaced it with the original. Han was furious and said that he had to guarantee his good luck for the coming year. After some persuasion from others, he reluctantly went home. Unexpectedly, by coincidence, a few days earlier, Han's father had suddenly passed away. Han thought that this misfortune was due to the mistaken white braided cord from last year. Therefore, he was uncontrollably angry and gathered many people, intending to negotiate with the barber shop. A neighbor, Song, learned about this and came out to dissuade him, and Han finally stopped. It was indeed a coincidence and an amusing story.</p>
<h3>Supplement to a Scene of Reunion and Separation of Famous Actors</h3>
<p>— 澤丞</p>
<p>Previously, a report mentioned the famous actor Wang Yunfang breaking away from his adoptive father. His life story, as reported in various newspapers and magazines, still felt vague, or detailed but not true. Now, based on what I know, I will supplement it to be more accurate. Initially, he experienced chaos in his youth. The disaster he encountered was neither natural nor man-made, but due to discord between father-in-law and son-in-law, resulting in a loss of contact. This led to wandering, barely escaping death, and encountering both tragedy and wonder. Please take this as a factual account to share with readers.</p>
<p>Distinguished Family: Yunfang was from a prominent family in Jintan. His grandfather, Shouqin, was a successful candidate in the imperial examination in the year of Bingzi and served as the head of Dongchang Prefecture in Shandong. His father, Bichang, also served as an official in Shandong. He was known for his integrity and good governance wherever he went. When he retired and returned to his hometown, hundreds of people welcomed him, resembling the style of the two Shu who retired in the past.</p>
<p>Raised by Maternal Relatives: Yunfang lost his mother at the age of four. His father, feeling unable to raise him well, sent him to his maternal uncle's family in Jinan. His maternal grandmother doted on him, and his maternal grandfather taught him to read. He was naturally intelligent, and by the age of nine, he was proficient in literature and art.</p>
<p>Beaten and Abused: Later, his maternal grandmother passed away, and her successor was fierce and unreasonable. He was subjected to beatings, stabbings, and all kinds of abuse. Cold and hunger were common occurrences. He had no choice but to flee. His maternal family also moved soon after. At that time, his father was poor and out of contact, so he simply ignored him.</p>
<p>Unusual Flute Sound: After fleeing, he wandered the streets. During the day, he pretended to be a storyteller, playing the flute in the market. At night, he used the clock tower in the town as a place to rest. His childhood was spent in poverty, to this extent. However, his intelligence was unmatched.</p>
<p>Unstable Fosterage: There was a Qiu who worked as a salt carrier. He pitied Yunfang's refined appearance and took him in as an adoptive son, adopting the surname Qiu and changing his name to Jianzhou. After living there for more than a month, they were ultimately incompatible, and Qiu drove him away again.</p>
<p>Piaomu Feeds Han Xin: It was the end of the year, and he was suffering from hunger and cold. He was sleeping alone on a millstone when two women came to work, grinding. They took pity on him as a descendant of nobility and took him home, clothing and feeding him. This was not unlike Piaomu of that year.</p>
<p>Imprisoned by Bandits: One day, he suddenly encountered Qiu on the road and followed him to Cao County. He was captured when bandits attacked Cao City. He was in the midst of gunfire every day (the scar on his leg is still there). After several months, he managed to escape to Jinan.</p>
<p>Studying at the Society: At that time, the Shandong Province established the Easy Customs Society, which recruited talented young people, providing general education as well as teaching opera. Yunfang joined. He graduated after six years, repeatedly winning championships. He was already eighteen years old.</p>

Unable to contain their grief and joy, the scene of the reunion of flesh and blood was realized.</p>
<h3>"Wild Orchids" Film Review</h3>
<p>— 欣俯</p>
<p>"Wild Orchids" starring Greta Garbo, tells the story of an American couple traveling to Java. On their trip, they encounter a Javanese prince and his concubine, Mayna, who pretends to befriend the husband while secretly trying to seduce him. When her secret affair is discovered, she becomes enraged and attempts to kill the prince during a tiger hunt. Fortunately, he is saved in time. The wife then criticizes her husband for being so cruel. The husband believes that his wife has fallen in love with the prince and angrily returns home alone. But when he boards the train, he sees that his wife is already waiting for him in the compartment. It is only then that the wife's true feelings are revealed. The plot is full of twists and turns, far beyond what the audience can imagine.</p>
<p>Ms. Garbo's charming demeanor and artistic talent are already well-known at home and abroad. However, there is one more thing worth mentioning. The women Garbo has portrayed in previous films have often been dissolute and unruly. But in this film, she plays a beautiful and cold young woman who refuses to abandon her elderly husband for the handsome and dashing prince. Her attitude, seemingly affectionate yet indifferent, will captivate even the audience. Garbo is truly versatile.</p>
<p>In terms of background, there are magnificent Javanese palaces and beautiful Javanese landscapes. In terms of interspersed scenes, there are captivating Javanese dances and thrilling tiger attacks, all of which are very interesting to watch. The film is scheduled to premiere at the Paris Grand Theater the day before the Double Tenth Festival.</p>
<p>Correction: In the third section of my article "Northern Railway Station Anecdotes" on October 4th, the last two or three lines, "Then the lieutenant general sent another letter saying that it had to be this," are not factual. I hereby voluntarily correct this. Lanxi</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Southeast Asia (61)</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>On July 14th, Principal Huang Shuitian and Ou Ying gave speeches at his school. That day was the 19th day of the sixth lunar month, the birthday of Guanyin. Master Daojie, Master Wanhui, nuns Zheng Kangmian and Chen Youjia, and others initiated the Guanyin Wan Yuan Meeting at Longhua Temple.</p>
<p>On the 18th, Wang Qiyuan, the manager of the Anxi Association, invited me to move into the Anxi Association. Chairman Lin Gengshen and Chen Liangliang hosted me. On the 20th, Chen Shoujin, the manager of the Yangon newspaper Yunxin Poetry Society, and others invited me to give a lecture at the poetry society. Their society's rules were quite commendable. The society had fewer than a hundred members, but their achievements were remarkable. Their method was to hold a meeting every week, arbitrarily selecting two characters. For example, "Tian Zhou" (Universe) would be used, and dice would be rolled to determine the number of dots, which would then correspond to the nth character in a seven-character line, named the nth chant. This would form a couplet, and each person would create several couplets. For each couplet created, two jiao of silver must be paid. Each volume used pre-printed strips of paper without the author's name. The president would then be publicly elected to evaluate A and B grades. For example, if 30 out of 100 couplets were selected, there would be a reward. Forty couplets would be considered medium selection, and the remaining thirty would be deputy selection. The prize money for the thirty names would come from the two jiao of silver paid by each person for each of the hundred couplets. If a person created five couplets and one was selected, they could break even. This was just one example. There were other methods as well. In general, this method was less rigid, and creating a poem was more interesting, so it lasted for a long time without declining. I saw that there were quite a few valuable couplets created according to this example and greatly appreciated them. This was truly a magnificent view of overseas culture. Everyone invited me to speak. My topic was the Poetry Movement and the Main Points of Life Revolution, describing how China, India, and Greece were all enlightened by poetry. In ancient times, reciting poetry was used for governing. Today, England has a poet laureate. US President Wilson's speech before entering the war stated the power of poets, which people do not know. If the world's politics are to be greatly improved, then politicians must be poets. Therefore, I hope to attract more new members, and it would be even better to attract female poets to join. We can also open a youth division for those aged eight or nine to nineteen. Vernacular poetry can also be added, along with elegant games such as music, Western painting, fine arts, and sports. We can also set up a poetry village. I once started the Juehua Poetry Society in Beiping, wanting to start a poetry village movement, but I did not find a good method. Overseas movements have great prospects. This is truly improving the national flower's literary brilliance. As a result, everyone selected two characters as the next poetry topic and invited me to judge the poems.</p>
<p>On the 23rd, I met again with the secretary of the Theosophical Society, Naganattans. I gave a lecture at the association last time, which was greatly appreciated by everyone. This time, I asked about the association's content and learned that although it was in Myanmar, it was still run by Indians. This gentleman was also an Indian. There was a tacit understanding between China and India in terms of spirit, and they were working together on cultural movements. When I go to India in the future, the association will send someone to wholeheartedly receive me because the association has 15 million people worldwide, and the president is an Indian woman. I was also given a copy of "Awakening" by the vice president, Mrs. Cousing.</p>
<h3>Correspondence from Europe (76)</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Pilgrimage to Italy Diary</p>
<p>(2) Yu Zhong (C</p>
<p>When the train crossed the border between Italy and France, it was around 3 p.m. We went through the routine procedures of checking passports and luggage. From this point on, the weather gradually became hotter, and everything felt different. The most noticeable difference was the gendarmes wearing Napoleon-style tricorn hats and uniforms at every station. Some of them had fluffy white or black chicken feathers attached to their hats, which were very eye-catching. There were also many beautiful young women coming and going. The wide-brimmed hats made of cicada-wing gauze and the delicate pale yellow jackets were truly stunning. This must be the current popular dress in Italy. The beauty of Italian women is completely different from that of French women. They have strong and lively bodies, breasts that protrude like a 90-degree arc, full and shaking without sagging, resembling Greek and Roman sculptures. It is a kind of aesthetic bewilderment. Straight noses, fluffy and soft hair, cherry-like lips, and two dark eyes full of sparkling light beneath delicate eyebrows all resemble the goddesses in Titian's paintings. They are truly intriguing. Their moving posture and the beauty of their lively and abundant expressions are rare in any Western country.</p>
<p>We arrived in Turin, which marked the end of one stage. After transferring to the train we needed, we ate at the station. The weather was already very hot. The cheerful Italians are always pushing forward, and the crisp sounds coming from their mouths are very pleasant to hear. I have heard people say that the Italian language is light, graceful, crisp, and otherworldly. It is a sacred song praising the gods. The French language is clear and flowing, like elegant social speech in a salon. It is the elegant clear sound of the human world. I have a similar feeling. The train continued to move southeast. All along the way, I saw clusters of lush trees by the road. In some places, very tall and green coconut trees grew, and the ground was full of large cacti. The green of the grass was so green that it seemed oily. Because of this, I felt that I had already tasted the flavor of Southern Europe. As we continued, we traveled for about an hour or two. From near Genoa, the train we were on continued along the coast. This is the Tyrrhenian Sea. Mer Tyrrhenienne</p>
<p>The blue sky of Southern Europe shines on the boundless, calm green sea. The exquisite and elegant old houses along the coast are covered with sea breeze, wrapped in a pleasant atmosphere. As I looked at these places, I thought, Putuo Mountain is not so beautiful, Japan is not so elegant, and Switzerland is not so vast. I think there are few such places in the world. Such majestic mountains and rivers must have soaked into the minds of the Italians and influenced their nature.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Show Strong Upward Momentum</h3>
<p>Tight Market Conditions: Yesterday, the gold market situation seemed quite firm and upward momentum continued to strengthen. Prices quickly broke through the 70 tael barrier. However, the price fluctuation throughout the day was only one or two taels at the beginning and end of the market, with a total range of over seven taels. Foreign exchange was also relatively tight, with traders showing strong buying interest, mainly for hedging. Trading in the market was very active, with demand exceeding supply. Yuansheng, Wanxing, Taikang, Runyuan, Maoyong, and others were all actively buying, while sellers included Fuchang, Yuancheng, Yongyuan, and Heng, among others. Silver bars initially fell in the early morning market, leading to a higher opening. Afterwards, prices fluctuated around 70 taels. At noon, the foreign exchange situation became even tighter, and buyers were still plentiful, so prices soared, rising by five or six taels.

Overall, the market sentiment was somewhat erratic, but it did not seem to be tiring out.</p>
<p>High Opening: The opening price for November was 569.2 taels, an increase of 4.8 taels. This was likely because large silver bars had been reduced by a total of 1,875 bars in the previous two days, with silver prices down by .25 and silver being sold from the mainland.

Mitsui offered near-term Japanese gold at 1 tael, 2 qian, and 7 fen. The industry aggressively shorted "Xianling" orders. The December 7 pence 75. Around 2:30 p.m., the gold price rose to 74.5 taels. Later, Hengxing and others sold, and hedging firms like Fuchang and Yuanheng also sold slips while buying remittances, so the price fell back by over three taels. However, there was a fluctuation of over one tael at around 4 o'clock, with the price at 71 taels. Afterwards, small households chased in, slightly raising the price by 1.4 qian. It was then suppressed again to 1.78 qian. At the 4:30 p.m. close, it was 572 taels, an increase of 7.6 qian compared to the previous Saturday.

<p>Many firms traded due to limited supply and strong demand. However, inflows and outflows were chaotic. Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yuancheng, Yong, Deheng, Chunyong, Tianfayong, Yongfeng, and others sold. Yuanmaoyong, Zhifengyong, Senchangyong, and Dadecheng were quite active in and out of the market. Yuancheng, Taikangrun, Wanxing, Shunli, Bingxing, Fuyu, Xinheng, and Hengxing all bought. In the afternoon, Yuancheng Yong, Fuchang Yuanmaoyong, and Yuanheng sold. Wanxing, Shunli, Taikangrun, and Yuancheng all bought. Goods were sometimes bought and sold, while those who hedged foreign exchange sold. The Dalian gang bought 1,600-1,700 silver bars and sold over 1,000. The Guangdong gang bought slightly, it was said.</p>

The Shanghai HSBC's listed rates for foreign exchange did not rise or fall and were the same as the previous Saturday. However, the trend in the domestic market had already strengthened. Because the gold market had broken through the 70 tael mark again, sentiment was firm, causing all exchange rates to improve from the start.

<p>The banks were closed for two consecutive days, first due to the days of the week, then due to the Mid-Autumn Festival.

The usual amount of settlements could not be recorded in detail. The market commission rate in the morning was 7 qian, 2 fen, 9 li, 2 hao and a half. In the afternoon, it was 7 qian, 2 fen, 9 li, 1 hao and a half, which was slightly better by 2 hao and a half compared to the previous noon.

<h3>Cotton Yarn: An Observation of the Cotton Yarn Market Under Pressure</h3>
<p>The Past, Present, and Future: The cotton yarn market seems to have entered a state of stalemate, hovering between 34 and 35 taels. The upward momentum seems insufficient, but a decline is also unlikely. It is extremely difficult to predict the future. The situation in the cotton yarn market was extremely abrupt in the middle of last month. The news of peace in the northern war situation, which had been brewing for several months, gave the weakened market a sudden boost. Within days, the price rose from 47-48 taels to 53-54 taels, a sharp increase. The cotton yarn market had been languishing for a long time due to war and the spread and persistence of banditry. The current rebound of 7-8 taels due to good news about the situation is not considered excessive. However, the interior is plagued by soldiers and bandits, and its vitality is almost exhausted. Furthermore, after last year's poor harvest, current sales have been sluggish. Although the merchants were excited by the news of peace, there was no demand in the interior. However, in view of the expectation of higher prices in the market, they had to make some purchases. This sluggishness in current sales is a manifestation of this phenomenon. Therefore, the maximum transaction volume was only 4,000-5,000 bales. Although a transaction volume of 4,000-5,000 bales is better than the 1,000-2,000 bales in the past, it is still not much in a situation where the market is extremely tired and reacting after a long period of chaos. Moreover, the price of American cotton plummeted from over 11 cents to close to 10 cents. Therefore, the rising trend in the cotton yarn market was hit hard and temporarily stopped. However, a decline seems unlikely in the short term, as the atmosphere of peace and market sentiment will be stimulated. In summary, although the peaceful situation is enough to promote the development of the cotton yarn market, there are still many opposing forces. In other words, the forces driving the market upward are strong, but they have been offset by other factors. Temporarily, the market will likely remain in a state of consolidation, waiting for external forces to determine its rise or fall.</p>
<p>Stable and Quiet "Ren Biao" Yarn: In the morning, the "Ren Biao" yarn market was quite stable due to increasingly positive news about the situation. Prices for all months rose by 3-4 cents. In the afternoon, the prices of third-grade yarn tended to rise, and the market remained stable, with prices for all months rising by 2-3 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 10,500 bales. Prices for each month are as follows:</p>
<p>"Ren Biao" Price Increases/Decreases, Inventory: Closing Price Increases/Decreases, Inventory</p>
<p>October: 15.22, up 0.02, 1,750</p>
<p>November: 15.32, , 2,460</p>
<p>December: 15.31, , 3,780</p>
<p>January: 15.32, up 0.05, 3,500</p>
<p>February: 15.23, up 0.01, 2,850</p>
<p>March: 15.38, up 0.06, 2,300</p>
<p>Existing Transactions Progressively Expanding: Transactions of existing yarn are still continuous. The total transaction volume was 1,892 bales. Merchants from Sichuan purchased 688 bales, Shantou merchants purchased 72 bales, inland merchants purchased 215 bales, merchants from Xuzhou and Jinan purchased 10 bales each, merchants from Hankou purchased 270 bales, merchants from Yantai, Anqing, and Wenzhou purchased 5 bales each, Qingdao merchants purchased 50 bales, Wuhu merchants purchased 24 bales, Guangdong merchants purchased 180 bales, Xiamen merchants purchased 25 bales, Ningbo merchants purchased 10 bales, and fellow traders purchased 307 bales. The market is firm and stable, with prices up about 0.025 taels compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Pessimism About the Future of Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>U.S. Cotton Estimates Increase Again… World Consumption Declines</p>
<p>Domestic Cotton Harvests Are Poor… New Cotton Enters the Market in Small Quantities</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Schools Sell Vigorously… Domestic Cotton Fatigue Becomes More Apparent</p>
<p>The cotton market is in a state of uncertainty. Considering the domestic cotton production situation, it seems impossible for prices to fall. However, looking back at the state of the foreign cotton market, it is difficult to expect prices to rise. According to recent reports on the U.S. cotton harvest, the government estimates that this year's harvest will be higher than the last. With good weather, the cotton harvest is going smoothly, and there is hope of reaching 14.5 million bales. Although the Agricultural Bureau has a national accumulation movement, farmers are not very interested in hoarding due to the weak prices of general agricultural products. Moreover, merchants are very skeptical about when the accumulated raw cotton will be sold. With production increasing and consumption declining, the future market situation can be roughly determined. As for the Indian cotton situation, it certainly cannot run counter to U.S. cotton. Domestic new cotton harvests are poor due to bad weather, and cotton farmers are unwilling to sell at low prices. The supply of new cotton on the market is decreasing, while manufacturers are competing to sell Indian cotton at discounted prices, absorbing large quantities and signing many futures contracts. A significant number of U.S. cotton transactions are also taking place. If domestic new cotton can remain stable, the market may temporarily stabilize. However, the position of domestic cotton is becoming increasingly unfavorable. If it is sold out of necessity, buyers with sufficient inventories will be unwilling to absorb it. Then, the future trend of the cotton market will be even more fatigued than it is today. This situation directly affects cotton farmers, and the national economy also suffers significant losses. Because there is less domestic cotton on the market and farmers are unwilling to sell it cheaply, buyers have no choice but to absorb foreign cotton. Therefore, the import figures for foreign cotton have been increasing year by year. According to customs reports, the value of foreign cotton imports in 1927 was 88.9 million taels. It decreased slightly in 1928, but increased to over 100 million taels in 1929. It is feared that this year's figures will be even higher than last year. The impact of this huge outflow on cotton farmers is a cause for great concern.</p>
<p>Hankou Cotton Yarn: Near Months Up, Distant Months Down: The Hankou Cotton Exchange saw a weak market atmosphere in the morning due to the continued fatigue of the U.S. cotton market. However, the arrival of new cotton in the near months was not overwhelming, so the trend was relatively flat. Distant months fell by 0.02 taels. In the afternoon, the cotton yarn market was more active, and the market atmosphere stabilized. Near months rose by 0.005 to 0.01 taels, while distant months remained fatigued. The total transaction volume for the day was 26,600 dan. Prices for each month are as follows:</p>
<p>October: 32.40, up 0.01, 774,000</p>
<p>November: 32.35, , 104,600</p>

<h3>Divergence Between Third-Grade Cotton and U.S. Cotton</h3>
<p>U.S. Cotton Downtrend Unabated: Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market was initially calm and unremarkable due to wait-and-see attitudes among traders. Later, it became fatigued due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and a depressed mood on Wall Street. Futures fell by 4-11 points, and spot prices fell by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 6 points, and spot prices fell by 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 30 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (6th telegraph).</p>

<h3>Grains: Rice Market Up 0.5 Yuan After the Holiday</h3>
<p>Evening Market Turns Dull</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, over twenty boats arrived from the interior, with a total of about one hundred boats in the river. Sales were initially very brisk. New japonica rice also rose by 0.5 yuan, with top-quality "Zhen Zhen" rice opening at 18.2 yuan and ordinary rice rising to 17.5-17.6 yuan. The situation was lively, and there were many transactions. However, by noon and evening, sales turned dull. Because this rebound had reached a significant 2 yuan, sellers were eager to sell while buyers' appetites had diminished after the sharp rise. Therefore, the market atmosphere reversed, and the trend became lackluster. It would not be surprising if the market opened lower today. Early rice varieties such as "Baige" also rose by 0.2 yuan. The supply of "Yang Du Jian" rice was not abundant, and customer sales continued, with prices increasing by about 0.3 yuan. High-quality rice was mostly priced above 14 yuan. Foreign indica rice was generally up 0.1-0.2 yuan, and the situation was firm. White yuan rice was still scarce, and market sales were flat with little price fluctuation.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: 30-40 boats were seen at the river, and sales were extremely brisk. New rice prices generally rose by 0.4-0.5 yuan, and buying interest from all sides was strong. Most of the old and new rice was "Hufu" rice. Even mid-quality rice saw significant transactions, with prices mostly around 15.5 yuan, except for top-quality rice, which was similar to the Zhabei market. Early rice and red rice both increased by 0.2-0.3 yuan. "Yang Du Jian" rice also rose by about 0.3 yuan, with high-quality rice priced at 12.3-12.4 yuan. The market situation here was more stable than in the north. However, the overall trend must still follow the north.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Soft in the Morning, Slightly Firmer in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for foreign wheat fluctuated. Market sentiment for each month was mixed. The current month's prices were relatively stable because it was rumored that the large batch of warehouse warrants for the previous month had been sold by the factory to merchants from Tianjin. However, the prices for distant months were slightly weak due to the generally unfavorable market sentiment. At the opening of the market in the afternoon, the current month's prices were initially unfavorable because the factory stated that it could not purchase. However, market sentiment improved slightly due to activity from merchants. Distant months also rebounded slightly from the morning due to short covering. Looking at the subsequent results, whether or not this will be reliable depends on continued activity in North sales and whether prices fall too much. As a result, the current month's prices were down 0.0075 yuan from the previous week, November was down 0.0075 yuan, December was down 0.01 yuan, and January, February, and March were down 0.0005 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Market Weak and Downward</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally weak in both the morning and afternoon sessions. Because most of the current standard short positions are directly held by small and medium-sized factories in Shanghai and other locations, they have already placed foreign orders and are not entirely comparable to purely short sellers. Therefore, they are very stable. Buyers, on the other hand, are mostly outsiders and are temporarily unable to resist. So, although transactions are scarce, market prices continue to decline. As a result, the current month's prices were down 0.02 yuan from the previous week, November and December were down 0.02 yuan, January was down 0.04 yuan, and February and March were down 0.03 yuan. Current wheat has not yet opened for trading because the inspection fees have not yet been resolved.</p>
<h3>Raw Silk, Tea, and Dried Cocoons Increasingly Weak</h3>
<p>Recently, the dried cocoon market has been increasingly weak. Since the silk mills began to experience poor sales in Europe, the cocoon market has become increasingly quiet. Furthermore, silk mills in Shanghai have launched a strike to protest against public weighing, and silk mills in Wuxi and other places have also responded, taking unified action. This has further dampened the sales of cocoons. Cocoon prices have fallen by 5-6 taels. Spring dried cocoons are only priced at 130 taels (570-580 catties after refining), and summer cocoons are priced at 95 taels (700 catties after reeling). No one is interested.</p>
<h3>Distant Month Factory Silk Up 10-20 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign silk market was being mobilized by hoarders. Because European and American firms, in view of the fact that Yokohama Japanese silk futures have risen by 20-30 yen, and the fact that all Shanghai silk mills are now on strike, reducing silk production, are hoarding silk. 60 bales of distant month Shanghai factory silk for November, December, January, and February were traded, with prices up 10-20 taels. Da Chang purchased 5 bales of Sichuan factory silk, with prices remaining stable.</p>
<h3>Russian Firms Open for Red and Green Tea</h3>
<p>Recently, the tea market in Shanghai foreign firms has been slightly lively. The Mass Assistance Association has formally opened trading for Ningzhou red tea and Gongxi green tea, with a total of over 3,000 boxes traded at unchanged prices. However, this Russian purchase is due to urgent shipping schedules. Chinese tea merchants, in view of the limited quantity of Gongxi tea this year, are taking a slightly firmer stance on prices. Currently, the price of Zhenmei green tea is falling daily, and Russian firms may also purchase it.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Changsha Merchants Resume Buying</h3>
<p>Sales Temporarily Suspended in Wen, Tai, and Northern Anhui Due to Increased Taxes</p>
<p>Local Fabric Market: Recently, actual sales have been brisk, and there have been few changes in the market. However, current goods, such as 10-pound "San Lu" and "San Tu" coarse cloth, 12-pound "Yang He" and "Lan Shuang Yu" twill, and 11-pound "Mao Ying" coarse twill, are in short supply due to frequent strikes at various factories. Fine cloth remains sluggish, primarily because factories have large amounts of goods available. However, dyed cloth is selling well. Yesterday, merchants from Sichuan purchased over 100 pieces. Merchants from Jinan and Xuzhou also made purchases from time to time. The fabric market is quite active, with 150 pieces of 16-pound "Shuang Yu" and "Ji Qing" cloth trading at 9.45 taels and 15-pound "Dian Che" cloth trading at 9.1 taels.</p>
<p>East and West Piece Goods: Actual sales have become dull because sales have been temporarily suspended in Wen, Tai, and Northern Anhui due to increased taxes. However, merchants from Changsha were active again yesterday, purchasing over 200 pieces of eastern goods such as "Shuang Long Shui Lang" at 2.275 taels, "Da Qu Ma Ming Ni" at 3.45 taels, and "Tai Yang Mei Ren Yin Hua Zhi Gong Ni" at 3.2 taels. Merchants from Sichuan are still very interested in purchasing, and bought "Lie Yan Mu Qiu Zhi Gong Ni" at 3.275 taels, "Ma Gu Zhi Gong Duan" at 2.825 taels, "Ji Zhong Da Ku Rong" at 2.05 taels, and "Jiao Ji Zhong Zhong Shan Ni" at 2.77 taels. Western goods, such as "Fang Li Zhi Gong Ni," are in high demand from merchants from the Yangtze River area, and prices have reached 2.6 taels.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Tianjin Red Dates Expected to Arrive Soon</h3>
<p>Tianjin Opens at 8 Taels</p>
<p>Stored Tianjin red dates have sold out. New dates have opened in Tianjin, and the price reported by telegram yesterday was 8 taels. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai soon and are expected to be firm. The previous price for cotton red dates was 7.5 taels. Yesterday, it was reported that merchants in Tianjin opened at 7.8 taels, and retail prices in the north also rose from 7.2 taels to 7.5 taels. Because the arrival of red dates is scarce and sales are brisk, the trend is quite good. Current market prices are 9 taels to 6.4 taels, and the price for lower quality dates is 4.4 taels.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Rebar Plummets by Over 10 Taels</h3>
<p>Rebar: Rebar shipments are arriving in large quantities and at low cost. Therefore, traders who have received shipments are making significant profits. However, market prices have fallen due to slow sales. In recent days, prices have plummeted by over 10 taels because construction firms have received large quantities of rebar. The current price for 0.1 to 1.5-inch rebar is estimated at 93-94 taels, while lower quality rebar is only priced at 90 taels, a drop of 40 taels from the highest price. According to recent sales prices, traders are still making a profit. However, there are many holders of goods, so the future of the standard is not optimistic.</p>

<p>Opening Speech: Chairman and Mayor Representative Yu Hongjun delivered the opening speech, roughly saying, "Distinguished guests, today is the opening ceremony of the Publicity Week of the 3rd National Goods Movement Conference of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau. The municipal government feels very honored that you are here. Everyone must already know the importance of promoting national goods. Now I will make a brief report. Since the Nanjing Treaty was signed in China, it has been subject to economic pressure. Before 1876, the import of foreign goods was not as large as the export of national goods. Since 1876, foreign goods have gradually sold well. Now, most of the daily necessities rely on foreign goods. When we look at the customs statistics, we are all alarmed. China's international status is gradually declining. The people of the whole country should hurry up and realize the importance of resisting foreign goods. However, the resistance to foreign goods has been more than once, like the resistance to American goods in 1919 and the resistance to British goods in 1925. When we resist British and American goods, Japanese goods take the opportunity to sell well, so the effect is still very small. Therefore, to resist foreign goods, we must first promote national goods. We follow the Prime Minister's teachings and include the promotion of national goods movement in one of the seven movements. We must do our best to complete this mission. Now, when it comes to promoting national goods, we should simultaneously develop in three aspects: first, pay attention to the production of national goods. Paying attention to production should be divided into two aspects: (1) agricultural products, (2) industrial agricultural products. China has always been an agricultural country. Agricultural products such as silk and tea have a considerable position in various countries around the world. Later, Japan and India gradually improved and prospered, while our country's products declined and failed. Also, like rice, which is the main agricultural product of an agricultural country, we even produce our own rice that is not enough to eat and have to rely on foreign goods. How shameful is this? After careful consideration, what is the reason? Industrial aspects, although backward now, in fact, carving, architecture, and printing are all invented by China. All countries in the world have always been very envious, but they do not know how to improve, which leads to decline and backwardness. Now, we should use scientific methods to improve manufacturing in order to make progress. Second, in terms of the sales of national goods, in fact, Chinese people's commercial ethics and commercial sense are too lacking. There are many good national goods, but because the publicity is not effective, like silk and tea, the international publicity is not effective, so foreigners do not like to use Chinese goods. Also, like the imitation Panama hats produced in Sichuan, China, this kind of hat is very popular in the United States, but in China, because the publicity is not effective, there is no sales. Also, because the commercial ethics are too poor, the amount of foreign goods imported during the period when gold was cheap and silver was expensive, such as in 1917, 1918 and 1919, was alarming. They only knew how to make money for themselves and did not know about international relations and the interests of the masses, which led to the failure of national goods. If merchants can pay attention to commercial ethics and common sense, then the sales of national goods will be promising. Third, we must make national goods suitable for the needs of the people, because the public's purchase and selection of national goods is based on the price and the quality of the goods as the standard for good luck. Although the progress of industry and commerce is not achieved overnight, we always hope that we can absolutely not need to use foreign goods. We are now holding this third National Goods Movement Conference at a time when the military operations on the front line are about to end, and traffic will soon be restored. After the reactionary elements are eliminated, domestic and foreign affairs can be managed, and tariffs can be gradually reduced. People can live and work in peace, and the sales of national goods can also be increased. Now, when gold is expensive and silver is cheap, it is an opportunity to promote national goods. If everyone can work hard, national goods will have a day to flourish."</p>
<p>Preparation Process: Social Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan reported the preparation process, roughly saying, "The principle of why we are holding the opening of the Third National Goods Movement Conference today has been explained very clearly by Secretary-General Yu, the mayor's representative. What I want to say now is why we also need to hold this National Goods Movement Conference once a year, and the preparation process this time. I will take two or three minutes to report. July 1928 was the first time we held this National Goods Movement Conference. At that time, the government had just established its capital in Nanjing, and all political facilities were just beginning to be implemented. We felt that the people's food, clothing, and supplies were all foreign goods. Every year, the money given to foreigners because of the use of foreign goods amounted to 200 million to 300 million yuan. This is calculated by the surplus of exporting goods to offset imported goods, that is, each person has to contribute almost one yuan to foreigners every year. Now we want to find a way to prevent this one yuan from being taken out of our pockets and sent to foreigners again. We can only hurry up and promote national goods. We hold the National Goods Movement Conference for this purpose. However, Chinese people have the criticism of having a five-minute craze, so promoting an item is probably useless. We must come once a year until we have completely achieved our goal. Now, people who come to participate in the conference must go back and tell their fathers to teach their sons and their brothers to teach their younger brothers. Don't forget that we must think of a way not to contribute one yuan to foreigners every year. Last year's conference was held around the Double Tenth Festival, and this year's is also around the Double Tenth Festival. We want everyone to know why we want to use national goods and how to develop national goods, and also to encourage our families when we go back. As for the expenses of running this National Goods Movement Conference, the municipal government allocates three or four thousand yuan every year, and at the same time receives the support of various industrial and commercial circles. Some donate money and some donate items, on the one hand, it can make our National Goods Movement Conference run well, and on the other hand, it can promote their own products. Like the silk and satin industry, they donated a lot of cash and also donated a lot of clothing materials. Many other factories also donated money and items. Within a week</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>There are游艺 and speeches about national goods here every day, and one day was chosen to hold a National Goods Fashion Exhibition at the Dahua Hotel. Now everyone only knows that it is good to wear clothes, and you must buy foreign goods. In fact, Chinese manufacturers also have very good products. There are also tweed and wool. If you want to wear a suit, you can also buy national goods clothing materials. As for silk and satin, it is not necessary to say that foreign goods must be better than Chinese goods, that is wrong, and there are many Chinese goods that are very good, such as the products of the American-Asian Silk Weaving Factory and the Hangzhou Hulin Company, which are actually better than foreign goods. However, because customers like to buy foreign goods, and the stores have more profit from foreign goods and less profit from national goods, for example, the cost of foreign goods is one yuan per foot, and they can be sold for three or four yuan. Buyers do not know the original price and cannot go to foreign factories to ask. If it is national goods, at most add two or three cents to the wholesale price, and if you want to add more, people will not believe it. If you go to the factory that produces it to ask, you will know, so many silk shops ask the factory to weave the brand of foreign factories and pretend to be foreign goods to buy a good price. This situation can be understood by going to each store to investigate, so the National Goods Fashion Exhibition is to show all kinds of fashionable clothes, men and women's ordinary clothes, hunting clothes, etc., which can be made of national goods raw materials. As for why it is held at the Dahua Hotel, it is because the place is not enough. In addition, there are many places to promote, and you can see it by walking around these days. The responsibility of promoting national goods should not be pushed to the manufacturers alone, because if the general public does not use national goods, wouldn't it cause the manufacturers of national goods to lose money? So we have to imitate the Japanese, even though Japanese goods are not as good as Western goods, the Japanese must use Japanese goods in order to have a way, and if everyone in our country uses national goods, so that the factories of national goods can make money, they will naturally be able to gradually improve. Like this National Goods Department Store, although it is losing money, it is still trying its best to maintain it. On Nanjing Road, among the one hundred stores, almost ninety-nine sell foreign goods. There are less than one percent of stores that sell only national goods, especially here, where Yong'an and Sincere and other foreign goods malls are concentrated. It is very difficult to establish a National Goods Department Store here to compete with foreign goods. We must all think of ways to maintain it together, that is, to cooperate in production and consumption. During this National Goods Movement Publicity Week, everyone should work hard in all aspects. This is our hope. Speeches by other celebrities are omitted."</p>

<h3>Consulate in Canada Advocates for Overseas Chinese in Canada</h3>
<p>They have requests for us.</p>
<p>A good opportunity to abolish harsh regulations.</p>
<p>The Chinese Consulate in Canada, citing the oppression and suffering of overseas Chinese in Canada at the hands of the local government, sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating: "Regarding the Canada General Chamber of Commerce's initiation of a Sino-Japanese commercial investigation delegation scheduled to depart in October, and the United Kingdom's recent consideration of dispatching an economic investigation delegation to China, the purpose of these two delegations is none other than to visit China to foster goodwill and promote their respective domestic industries and commerce. When they engage in discussions and networking with political and business figures in our country, our consulate earnestly hopes to thoroughly inform them of the oppression and suffering endured by overseas Chinese in this area at the hands of the local government, explaining the advantages and disadvantages, so that they may incorporate this information into their reports upon returning home or disseminate it through oral communication. This aims to prompt their governments to conduct evaluations and demonstrate that our citizens are determined not to disregard the hardships of overseas compatriots. This will also provide additional support when the Sino-British commercial treaty is revised in the future, making it easier to achieve results. As for the 44,000 overseas Chinese in Canada, their suffering primarily stems from the harsh provisions of the 1923 Immigration Act No. 43. Since the implementation of this act, all efforts to repeal it over the years, as well as the consulate's negotiation efforts, have yielded no results to date. Therefore, the overseas Chinese community believes that attention must be paid to the treatment of overseas Chinese in British colonies during the revision of the commercial treaty. Given the particularly severe impact of the harsh regulations on overseas Chinese in Canada, it is especially necessary to declare their abolition in the new treaty. Since the promulgation of these regulations, the wives and children of all overseas Chinese in Canada are not allowed to come to Canada. Students must possess a university degree to be allowed to study in Canada. Upon completion of their studies, they must leave Canada and are not allowed to reside there. When overseas Chinese return to China, their return to Canada is limited to two years; after this period, they are not allowed to return. The inspection of Chinese when entering the country is excessively harsh. These measures are intended to sever the influx of Chinese into Canada. It is feared that within a century, Chinese will disappear from Canada. Although the harsh regulations nominally recognize that Chinese merchants can enter, the restrictions are too strict. Not only must they possess capital of over 2,500 Canadian dollars, but they must also be dedicated to the business for more than three years, specializing in the sale of Chinese secondary products in Central Canada, to be considered qualified. However, it has recently been found that these facts are being completely disregarded, and Chinese merchant qualifications are not recognized, regardless of their capital strength. Therefore, a strict attitude is being shown, and entry is not allowed. Those already in Canada are often subjected to discriminatory local government regulations, such as prohibiting Chinese restaurants from employing white women as waitresses and banning Chinese workers in factories. Recently, because many overseas Chinese in Western Canada are engaged in agriculture and are known for their resilience, Canadians have become jealous and are implementing countermeasures, demanding that local governments stipulate value restriction regulations for agricultural products, and so on. Such incidents occur frequently. Although overseas Chinese exert their utmost efforts to resist, such as organizing bureaus to refute regulations, hiring lawyers to file appeals, and mobilizing the press to publish public opinion and imploring assembly members to oppose their passage, their efforts have yielded very limited results. In summary, our overseas citizens are already in a situation of struggling for survival. Now, taking advantage of the fact that the other party has requests for us, we deeply hope that all parties in our country will cooperate to fight for justice for overseas Chinese. During the treaty revision, the harsh regulations of the Canadian side must be abolished. Otherwise, the overseas Chinese intend to return the treatment they receive to the Canadians, returning to China to promote and implement a boycott of Canadian goods to strike a fatal blow and prompt them to reflect. This is a last resort. Enclosed are copies of the "Declaration of Overseas Chinese in Vancouver, Canada, Regarding Immigration Regulations" from 1927 and the original English manuscript of the "Petition to the Canadian Immigration Department" from the Fifth All-Canada Representative Conference of the Kuomintang in Canada this year. We hope that you will examine these and use them as publicity materials."</p>
<h3>Li Mingyang's Suppression of Bandits is Earnest</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Yesterday Needed Xiong Shihui</p>
<p>Telegraphic Commendation to Show Encouragement</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Commander, Xiong Shihui, previously reported the situation of bandit suppression by the Jiangsu Bandit Suppression Commander, Li Mingyang, and immediately telegraphed General Chiang Kai-shek and requested a special reward. The Garrison Headquarters received a telegram from General Chiang yesterday, stating roughly: "Your telegram regarding the winter offensive has been read in full. Commander Li's supervision of the suppression of bandits in Tongzhou, Rugao, and other counties is deeply earnest. A telegram of commendation should be issued immediately to show encouragement, and further orders should be given to track down and thoroughly eliminate the bandits at an early date."</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Prohibits the Export of Japonica Rice in Packages</h3>
<p>Orders for the Rice Industry to Comply</p>
<p>Also a Letter to the Jianghai Customs for Verification</p>
<p>The export of Jiangsu Province's japonica rice has always been prohibited. Historically, grain purchases in Shanghai from various places have also been limited to non-glutinous rice. The Municipal Social Bureau recently discovered that the Xin Zha Yonghexiang and Qingshengyi rice shops were using military rice passports to export japonica rice in packages. Therefore, a directive was issued to the Rice Trade Association, stating: "Regarding compliance matters, the export of Jiangsu Province's japonica rice has always been prohibited. Historically, grain purchases in Shanghai from various places have also been limited to non-glutinous rice. However, it has been discovered that the Xin Zha Yonghexiang and Qingshengyi rice shops dared to use military rice passports to export japonica rice in packages, which is highly inappropriate. In addition to conducting a separate investigation, it is rumored that unscrupulous merchants, driven by greed, are planning to take advantage of the opportunity to smuggle large quantities of rice overseas, reaping huge profits. If such unscrupulous behavior is not warned against in advance, it will escalate and lead to soaring grain prices. Just as the common people are being relieved from the grain shortage, they will be subjected to repeated exploitation by unscrupulous merchants. Therefore, this association is strictly ordered to immediately instruct its members that all japonica rice must not be exported in packages. If rice prices are found to be low, purchases should be made to store grain for the coming year in warehouses, and the storage should be registered with this bureau in accordance with the municipal regulations on public rice storage, which will be guaranteed. Otherwise, if packaged rice is found, it will be considered as prepared for export and will be severely punished without leniency. This is imperative. At the same time, a letter was also sent to the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office, stating: "Regarding the transshipment and re-export of rice in this city, all registrations are done by this bureau with a stamped seal, and inspection and release are carried out by the Customs Commissioner of your Customs. The passport for purchasing rice in Shanghai is first inspected by your office and then registered by this bureau. This has been the practice for a long time, but it is all limited to foreign rice, non-glutinous rice, and a small amount of non-glutinous glutinous rice. The external transport of japonica rice is still prohibited in Jiangsu Province. However, it is recently rumored in the market that a large quantity of japonica rice is being exported in packages, and one case has already been discovered, which is not without reason. At this time when the people's food supply has just been restored, there are large-scale exports. If preventive measures are not taken immediately, the consequences will be dire. Therefore, we specifically request that your office promptly instruct the Customs to conduct strict inspections of wheeled vehicles carrying packaged rice for export, checking for any smuggled japonica rice leaving the country. For rice purchasing passports issued before October 1, even if they have already been registered with this bureau, please instruct them to report to this bureau again for re-examination to clarify the situation. This bureau will then prepare an official letter for the Customs Commissioner to release the goods, in order to prevent loopholes and ensure due diligence. This matter concerns the food supply of the entire city and we hope to receive your support. We hereby send this letter for your examination and reply."</p>
<h3>Grand Occasion of the Memorial Service for Mr. Yuan Guanlan in Baoshan</h3>
<p>His posthumous title is "Mr. Hongyi." After the death of Mr. Yuan Guanlan, the people of Baoshan organized a committee to commemorate Mr. Yuan and planned to hold a public burial and erect a memorial碑, etc. On the 5th (the day before yesterday), a memorial meeting was held in the Mass Assembly Hall in the city. More than a thousand people attended, and hundreds of elegiac couplets were hung all over the walls. The meeting began at 2 o'clock with the playing of mourning music, photography, and the singing of a mourning song. Then, the chairman, Mr. Wang Zouyun, delivered the opening remarks, stating that the presence of more than a thousand people today shows the depth of respect among the local people. Mr. Wu Shiqiao reported on Mr. Yuan's deeds, such as advocating for public libraries, establishing schools, handling land surveys, transportation, farms, and life-saving, etc. Although he sometimes lived away from Baoshan, his heart never forgot Baoshan. Therefore, even in his illness, he still focused on Baoshan affairs, etc. After the presentation of flowers and the reading of the eulogy, County Chief Qiu delivered a speech, saying that Mr. Yuan's cause deeply moved him, especially when he visited the Baoshan rural elementary school and recognized the practical results of Mr. Yuan's school management. Also, he received Mr. Yuan's support in administrative matters, and difficulties were easily resolved, showing the profound influence of morality. Mr. Pu Xieying of the Education Bureau said that Mr. Yuan had a broad mind, so he could handle affairs without fear of hard work or resentment. When Mr. Yuan was in a difficult situation in 1927, the youth of this county planned to raise money to send to him. Although the matter did not succeed, the feelings were deeply moving. Mr. Gu Zhenjun, director of the Doubtful Properties Department, said that Mr. Yuan was like a complete encyclopedia. When colleagues encountered difficult problems, they consulted Mr. Yuan, and they always received essential solutions, showing Mr. Yuan's vast knowledge. Mr. Hong Lanxiang, a representative of the Water Conservancy Association and the Shanghai Municipal District, said that Mr. Yuan's cause in Baoshan was as solid as the stone embankment built by Lord Hu. If anyone destroys Mr. Yuan's cause, the people of the county should strive together to resist. Although we have been incorporated into the Shanghai Municipal District, we should jointly take responsibility for carrying it out. After the representatives of various organizations delivered their speeches, Mr. Lai Bao and Mr. Ma Wujun said that Mr. Yuan had enlisted Mr. Ma as an ally in running compulsory education. However, it is rare to find someone like Mr. Yuan who can solve the fundamental problems of compulsory education and take each step carefully. Therefore, Mr. Yuan's death is not only mourned by the people of Baoshan, but also deeply mourned by those who reside in Baoshan. Mr. Feng Maijue said that upon hearing of Mr. Yuan's death, his colleagues all stamped their feet in regret, which is very different from being applauded after death. Therefore, death at the feet and death at the hands are immeasurable, etc. Then, guests Feng Xiwu and Zhu Jianshan, etc., delivered speeches. After the speeches, the chairman respectfully designated Mr. Yuan's posthumous title as "Mr. Hongyi," and reported on the memorial arrangements. Afterwards, Mr. Bai Shilang, Mr. Yuan's eldest son, replied with thanks. The meeting ended at 6 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, Shanghai Law College Welcomed Dr. Yokota from Japan</h3>
<p>Must Return to Japan in One Week. The Shanghai Law College on Jiangwan Road in Shanghai, in view of the visit of Dr. Yokota Hideho, president of Meiji University of Japan, to China, arrived in Shanghai on the 6th of this month. In order to promote friendship, the college specifically arranged yesterday (the 7th) morning to welcome the doctor to the college for a visit and lecture. Mr. Dai Xiuzan, director of the law department of the college, personally went to the Fengyang Hotel where the doctor was staying to welcome him, and immediately accompanied him to the college. In addition to the doctor, there were also Professor Akagami Yoshiyuki of Meiji University's Department of Sociology, Mr. Onishi Tanetsujiro, advisor to Meiji University, and Mr. Shio. They were received by the college's dean of academic affairs, Shen, and professors Zhang Yaozeng, Huang Tong, and Li Jianhua, who accompanied them on a brief tour. Then they went to the auditorium for the lecture. Dean Shen briefly introduced the doctor and then invited the doctor to speak. Mr. Dai Junliang translated. The speech was lengthy and will not be recorded in detail. It mainly stated that Japanese culture and Chinese culture have a close relationship, and the educational circles of China and Japan must cooperate and work together to promote the development of East Asian culture. The speech was very sincere. In the end, he said that after returning to Japan, he would communicate frequently and discuss various issues concerning education. Then, Professor Akagami lectured on the methods of social science research, which was translated by Huang Tong. Mr. Akagami was full of energy and his arguments were thorough, providing instructions on methods of academic research for scholars, which was especially appropriate. After the lecture, the dean of academic affairs represented the school to express gratitude, and Mr. Shio took a photograph to commemorate the event. It is said that it will be printed in the Meiji University prospectus in the future. It is reported that the doctor is currently the president of the Supreme Court of Japan. He is very busy with his official duties, and this visit to China is very short. He must return to Japan in one week. He only plans to stay in Shanghai for two days, so he may not be able to accept all the invitations to lecture. The lecture at the Law College was the first place he visited after arriving in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Such a Tragic Event in the World: The Wei Family Throws Themselves into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>The natural son… violently thrown into the river</p>
<p>Husband and wife… jump in one after another</p>
<p>Wei Min rescued… the wife's body found</p>
<p>A tragic scene under the pressure of life</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around four o'clock, an extremely tragic case of suicide by drowning occurred in the Huangpu River. A woman and a boy died, and a man was rescued. The circumstances are extremely pitiful. An investigation into the background and aftermath is recorded below:</p>
<p>Prolonged life, impoverished and frustrated. Wei Min, courtesy name Yan Zhi, from Hengshan, Hunan, recently changed his name to Yan Can, to reflect the idea that there is no joy in life, only a lingering breath. He has a wife who speaks with a Yangzhou accent and an eleven or twelve year old son. Wei had been unemployed for a long time, and impoverished. On the fifth of last month, he brought his wife and children by boat from his hometown to Shanghai to seek a livelihood, staying at Room 16, 2nd Floor, Central Apartment, 515 Yuele Lane, Edward Road, at a monthly rent of 15 yuan. However, the funds they brought were limited, and their daily expenses depended on pawning clothes for cash. The hardship of their life can hardly be described.</p>
<p>The whole family jumps into the river to commit suicide. Wei Min had some literacy and had drafted an article to submit to a newspaper, but the draft was over ten thousand words long and could not be published. Wei was extremely disappointed and all his plans failed. He planned to commit suicide. On the evening of the 5th of this month, he wrote a suicide note in the Central Apartment where he was staying. At midnight, when the tea boy was about to turn off the lights, he asked to delay it, saying he was writing a letter. Later, the tea boy paid attention to his actions and saw him buried at his desk, writing all night until dawn before going to bed. Wei slept until the afternoon of the 6th, and late at night he took his wife and son out without saying goodbye. Before leaving, he left a letter to the manager of the apartment, expressing his intention to take poison, but wanting to die cleanly, he went to jump into the river, etc. The apartment waited until dawn (yesterday morning) and did not see Wei and others return. Fearing something might have happened, they entered his room to investigate and found a letter on the table. After reading it, they knew that they had all committed suicide. However, it was too late to save them. There was nothing to do but sigh.</p>
<p>The suicide note is extremely tragic. The letter left by Wei to the manager of the apartment, Wu Yunqi, was a hundred words long, each word a tear, unbearable to read. It is transcribed below: "To the manager of the Central Apartment: I, Wei, am unlearned and unskilled. In recent years, things have often gone against me. Not only am I an ordinary person, but I am also a weak one. Now I have joined the ranks of Qu Yuan. I sigh at this failure. People will certainly scold me for not cultivating merit, but I ask myself that I have never let anyone down. To whom can I tell the story of my life? Since arriving in Shanghai, it has been more than forty days, and all my efforts have failed. My fate is evident. Moreover, I am neither skilled in martial arts nor in art. How can a family of several people make a living? If we talk about Shanghai, it is extremely prosperous, but the wretched are everywhere, and those seeking pity and help are also numerous. Is there no room for me to beg? I do not know that my nature is stubborn. I have always seen those who drag out their lives, begging in the street, as lacking ambition. I might as well prepare to die, not for the sake of glorifying my ancestors. I dare not call myself a martyr, but I still have blood in my veins. Therefore, I will first kill my weak wife and young child, lest they be left alone in the world, bringing shame to their hometown. To die together is the only way to be clean. I have been staying in your apartment for thirty-two days, relying on pawning things to make a living. There is little left to sell. Fortunately, I can pay the rent in your apartment. I only owe for the last two days. However, there are still some clothes in the room that can be sold to pay for the rent. The rest can be given to the tea boy and the toilet cleaner as my last words. The only reason I did not die in your apartment is that I fear causing trouble for your master. Therefore, after taking medicine, I will throw myself into the river, hoping to be clean. Now, I only ask that the manuscript I left be published in the news, or that a reporter be entrusted to publicize my plight, so as to comfort me in the afterlife. Your apartment must have many enthusiastic gentlemen who can help me achieve my goal. I will never forget to repay them. My thoughts are scattered, and my words are disorganized. Please take them into consideration. I wish you prosperity. (The following is omitted)."</p>
<p>An unparalleled tragedy. Wei took his wife and son out late the day before yesterday, walking slowly. The husband and wife only cried together. Until 4:15 yesterday morning, they walked to the Hankou Road New Customs Wharf, called a Ningbo sampan and said they wanted to cross to Yangjia Ferry in Pudong. The sampan driver asked for six jiao, and Wei bargained for four jiao, and the deal was done. The three of them sat in the cabin and floated towards the middle of the Huangpu River. It was not yet dawn at this time. The sampan rocked to the outside of the Mud Ferry Wharf in Pudong. Wei and his wife cried even more bitterly. Then, Wei picked up his own son and threw him violently into the river. Only splashes were seen, and the person sank without a trace. At the same time, Wei's wife walked to the bow and jumped into the river to commit suicide. Wei also jumped down together. In this instant, an unparalleled tragedy was created. Although the sampan driver tried to save them, the three of them entered the water quickly, and it was difficult for him to save all three. Only Wei was still floating on the surface of the water and had not sunk. The sampan driver tried his best to rescue him, but he had already drunk too much water and was unconscious. So he rocked him to the water police station and described the situation of the three suicides in detail.</p>
<p>Wei Min can hopefully be saved. After the police station received Wei from the sampan driver, they tried to feed him ginger soup and other things, but Wei was still lying on the ground unconscious. Fearing that there was another reason, the police chief ordered Hua Tan Cheng Yongnian to carry him to Shanghai Renji Hospital for treatment. After the doctor diagnosed him, Wei had taken a large amount of opium before jumping into the river. Then, with various operations, the toxic substances were completely removed first, and Wei gradually woke up. However, he was still very weak and his voice was low. By yesterday afternoon, his body had gradually become stronger. According to the doctor, there is no danger to his life. After receiving this news, the police chief ordered him to be kept in the nursing home until his mental and physical strength had fully recovered, and then he would find a way to help him.</p>
<p>Wei's wife's body was found. After Wei's wife jumped into the water and died, her body suddenly floated up at the Dongyang Company Wharf in Hongkou at 11 a.m. yesterday. She was wearing a short black coat and blue silk trousers, with small feet and a braided hairstyle. In the end, she sank to the bottom of the river, not full of seven hours, so her face was still alive, without much swelling. At this time, Water Police Station No. 45 Hua Bu was patrolling the river and found it. He dragged the body to the police station. The police chief sent a detective to call the staff of the Central Apartment to come and confirm that the female corpse was indeed Wei's wife. The police chief ordered the corpse to be transported to the Life Saving Bureau to prepare a coffin for temporary collection, and Wei would come to claim it after he was discharged from the hospital.</p>
<h3>The Grand View of the Zhejiang Tide</h3>
<p>Yesterday the tide exceeded the seawall</p>
<p>The audience cheered and cheered</p>
<p>Travel agencies add special trains today</p>
<p>The Qiantang autumn tide is a famous spectacle in Zhejiang. During the tide season, tens of thousands of Chinese and foreign guests come to admire it. This autumn, due to the weather, the tide is the largest in the past 16 years. In order to meet the needs of Chinese and foreign women, the China Travel Agency has organized tide-watching groups every year. This autumn, the company admired the tide of Bapu, which is even larger than Haining, and its momentum is even more spectacular. Therefore, the company organized a Bapu tide-watching group, which started to run special tide-watching trains every day from the 5th of this month. On the first day, it ran seven small chartered cars carrying about 40 passengers. On the second day, it increased sharply to 18 cars. Yesterday (the 7th) was the third day, and more guests came. It ran 20 special tide-watching trains, and then added 13 cars due to the continued chartering from the company, for a total of 33 cars. At 7:30 a.m. on the morning of that day, all the special trains departed from the company's door on Hubin Road, one after another, and arrived at the Bapu Weichang at 9:30 a.m. The two photographers who accompanied the journey took a group photo, and then the company prepared Western food and refreshments for the guests. Among the guests on that day were the wife of Liu Jiwen, superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and many attendants, who were personally received by the company's manager, Li Jingru. At about 12 o'clock, only the south tide arrived first, with great momentum. It rushed onto the stone embankment and rested for a while, and the east tide followed. When the two tides met, they collided and rose to tens of feet, and ten thousand horses galloped, rushing straight to the seawall. The momentum was like a snow mountain collapsing and a silver cliff collapsing, which was really shocking and spectacular. At that time, the company staff all told the guests to retreat to prevent danger, and all the guests who saw this ten-zhang tidal wave cheered and cheered. Fortunately, Chief Gao of the local county public security bureau led the police to maintain order in the enclosure, so the audience was quite safe, and the company's spirit of doing things was also seen in promoting travel. Today, the 8th, is the fourth day. The company is afraid that there will be more guests, so it plans to add 50 special trains in the next two days.</p>
<h3>The Xiao Xin'an Case That Caused a Sensation in Nanyang</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Organizations Unanimously Support (Communication from the Ministry of Culture of Jinda) The Peder School in Ambon, Dutch Nanyang, hired Ms. Xiao Xin'an from China as a teacher. Ms. Xiao took the Zhibade ship of Java Company on August 13 to go to school to work. On the ship, the Dutch deputy and second officers first seduced and then raped her, followed by violence and insults. This matter has been detailed in the Shanghai Shenbao on September 26. At this time when women's liberation and equal rights for men and women are being advocated, all Chinese people who read it are indignant. The former Nanjing Central District Experimental School and the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation, where Ms. Xiao previously worked, have sent telegrams expressing their opinion to thoroughly negotiate. The various ports in Nanyang are even more sensational, especially Makassar, which is where Ms. Xiao landed and is close to Ambon. According to the Makassar Min Sheng Bao, the entire overseas Chinese community in Makassar is very angry about this case. On the evening of September 3, dozens of people from the industrial, commercial, and academic circles held a meeting to discuss it and elected Jiang Yusheng, Shi Jietu, Ye Tianxia, and other seven people to prepare for the establishment of the Xiao Case Support Association, in order to thoroughly negotiate with the Java Company and achieve the final victory. On the 5th, the Makassar branch also convened a joint meeting of representatives of various communities to discuss methods. On the one hand, they still asked Consul Wang to continue to negotiate with the company based on facts and law. Later, the consulate in Makassar received a letter from the company to Ms. Xiao, stating, "We are very sorry for what happened on the Zhibade ship on August 19. It is not allowed by our company for the chief officer of our company to have indecent behavior towards you. Our company sincerely apologizes to you and will report this matter to the head office in Batavia, and the perpetrators will be severely punished," etc. After receiving the letter, Ms. Xiao believed that the ship's crew's violent behavior during the voyage should not be settled with a letter of apology. Various communities also advocated that Consul Wang should still file a second negotiation and attach several requests, clearly listed, and would not stop until the goal was achieved. It is clear that the overseas Chinese in Nanyang are filled with righteous indignation about this case and express their extreme sympathy for Ms. Xiao, and can speak out for weak women.</p>
<h3>Dr. Zhu Ziyun's Personal Account of His Kidnapping and Escape</h3>
<p>Dr. Zhu Personally Appeared in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Both Defendants Firmly Deny the Charges</p>
<p>The renowned physician Dr. Zhu Ziyun was kidnapped from his residence at 3151 Zhoujiazui Road on September 21st at approximately 10 AM.  Harbin Police Detective Zhu Hanbo and French Concession Police Detective Liu Changgen, believing that the Chongming woman Fei Zhu, the landlady of room two at 722 Caihua Lane, Qipu Road, and her husband, Fei Zhenkun, were connected to the bandits and were harboring the kidnap victim, arrested them and brought them before the Special District Court.  During interrogation, they denied the accusations and were released on bail of 3,000 yuan each, pending further interrogation when the victim, Zhu Ziyun, appeared in court. This information was previously reported in this newspaper.  It is now known that because the two defendants could not secure bail, they remained in custody. Yesterday morning, Judge Ge Zitan of the Third Criminal Court conducted a further hearing.  Zhu Ziyun, accompanied by his lawyer, Lu Qi, also appeared in court to provide testimony.  Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, stating that Dr. Zhu had arrived in court this morning and requested to be heard.  Zhu Ziyun then testified: "At around 10 AM this morning, I was seeing patients at my residence when four bandits suddenly arrived.  Two of them rushed in, grabbed my hands, and threatened me with pistols. They forced me outside.  One bandit pushed me violently from behind, while another stood guard in the courtyard.  I was forced into a car that they had pre-arranged.  My head struck the car window, and I became dazed.  However, I vaguely remember the route.  We turned off Yalu Road, went through Peng Road, and then entered Caihua Lane, where I was held temporarily on the upper floor of a certain building. We entered through the back door. Two bandits were assigned to guard me that evening. There was a Shaoxing woman, about twenty years old, who was in charge of bringing meals. I saw this woman standing at the door when I entered the bandit's den. I have never seen the two defendants before, but I heard them speaking with a Chongming accent, and they were calling for mahjong downstairs. The bandits all spoke with Jiangbei Shaoxing accents. One had a pockmarked face and wore Western clothes, and there was one female bandit (the one who delivered meals). At three o'clock the next morning, they moved me to a small boat in a secluded river in the French Concession. Two bandits took turns guarding me, each with a pistol. They did not ask me to write a letter to my family demanding ransom. After several days on the bandit boat, I became somewhat familiar with the bandits guarding me. I casually asked them if they were the leaders. They said that the leaders were all regimental commanders and brigade commanders, and they were hired by them, earning a monthly salary of thirty yuan. Later, I tried to persuade them with kind words, saying, 'If you want to be comrades, why not join the army?  Furthermore, your leaders are mistaken in thinking I am a wealthy man. I am just a doctor and have no savings. If the police were to catch you, you would be in great danger. I currently have sixty gold coins on my person. Could I give them to you temporarily in exchange for my release? I will give you a reward of five hundred yuan later, and I will not go back on my word.' The bandits seemed to understand what I was saying. On the 28th, they released me. I immediately returned home. They have not come to collect the five hundred gold coins to this day. I reported it to the police, and that evening, I went with detectives to Qipu Road to try and identify the bandit's den, but I couldn't find it. The next morning, I went again with the detectives and recognized the location where the two defendants lived. I had previously received threatening letters from the bandits demanding money, but I ignored them." Detective Zhu then testified that the extortion letters, two in total, were now in the police's possession. One demanded three thousand yuan, and the other demanded one thousand yuan, and they arranged to meet at the Tianhou Temple Bridge, among other things. Judge Ge verified the testimony and questioned the two defendants, who firmly denied the accusations. He then ordered them to be remanded in custody separately, pending a further hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>Three Homicide Cases in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Burning...Bullet Wounds...Murder</p>
<p>Worshipping Gods and Thanking Buddha Leads to the Burning of a Sick Child.  Ding Shaoqing, a farmer residing at 14 Nanjie Street, Hongqiao Town, Western Shanghai, is over seventy years old. He has only one son, named Genxin, who is fifteen years old and learning the lacquer trade. Shaoqing loves him like the apple of his eye. However, on the third of this month, Genxin suddenly fell seriously ill with typhoid fever. In addition to seeking medical treatment, the night before last, he specially invited two Taibao (a superstitious practice that is now prohibited) to his home to worship gods and thank Buddha, and went to the temple to "invite joy" (requiring seven lanterns) and perform various superstitious acts. At around two o'clock yesterday morning, the lantern hanging over the patient's bed, used for "inviting joy," suddenly caught fire, causing the bed curtains to ignite. At that time, Shaoqing and his wife were cooking tea downstairs. The only person in the upstairs room was Genxin, who was lying sick in bed. The Taibao and others had already left after completing their tasks. By the time Shaoqing brought the tea upstairs, the room was filled with flames. He attempted to save his beloved son twice, but was unable to enter. On the third attempt, he finally managed to rescue him, but Genxin had already been burned all over his body, with no intact skin. The scene was gruesome and unbearable to witness. He succumbed to his injuries and died yesterday morning. Shaoqing and his wife, seeing their beloved son dead, were overcome with grief. Tears streamed down their faces, and they repeatedly fainted. The family has now reported the incident to the Wangjialou Police Station of the First Branch of the Sixth District, requesting exemption from an autopsy and arranging for the burial themselves.</p>
<p>Accidental Discharge of a Bullet Kills a Colleague. Lei Zaiyin, a third-class police officer at the Longhua Substation of the Third Branch of the Sixth District of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, was from Dehua, Jiangxi, and was twenty-three years old. Wang Genglin, from Changshu, was thirty-three years old. The two had a very good relationship. At around ten o'clock the night before last, Lei, Wang, and Zhang Shijun were ordered to escort a thief to the Caohejing station. They then patrolled the area around the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road until 2:15 AM yesterday morning, when they returned to the Longhua Substation. Wang Genglin returned one or two minutes earlier. By the time Lei and Zhang returned to the bedroom, Wang was already sitting on the bunk on the west side. Lei Zaiyin, who was lying on the opposite side, had just unloaded four bullets from the rifle he was carrying, leaving one bullet inside, which he forgot about. As Officer Lei was about to hang the rifle on the wall, he accidentally touched the trigger with his finger. The bullet suddenly fired and struck Wang Genglin in the chest, who was resting on the opposite bunk. The bullet exited through his back, and he fell onto the bunk, dying instantly. A hole was also pierced in the wall. Lei, seeing the tragedy he had caused, was overcome with grief and attempted to shoot himself in the throat with the rifle, wishing to die as atonement. Fortunately, Zhang Shijun saw this and rushed to snatch the gun away. After investigation, Inspector Jia detained Lei and sent him to the Third Branch of the Sixth District, and then to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning. He also telegraphed Wang's family in Shanghai and reported the incident to the local court for an autopsy. Yesterday, the court sent Prosecutor Zhao, along with a forensic examiner, to confirm that the death was accidental. He ordered a coffin to be prepared for burial, pending further investigation.</p>
<p>A Murdered Male Corpse Discovered in a Wasteland. A murdered male corpse was discovered in the reeds in the southeast corner of the Magenlang area, number sixteen map, twenty-eighth Bao, south of Hongqiao Road, Western Shanghai (the area bordering the First and Second Branches of the Sixth District, very close to Zhongshan Road). A farmer saw it while cutting grass in the field and reported it to the Wangjialou Police Station of the First Branch of the Sixth District. Chief Chen of the patrol considered the area to be under the jurisdiction of the Second Branch of the Sixth District and immediately notified the Heyoujiao Police Station. Patrol Chief Li Huapu, upon receiving the report, went to inspect the corpse. The corpse was approximately twenty years old, with a naked upper body, wearing only white cotton shorts and yellow silk socks, without shoes. The hair was very long. The skull was shattered, the face was covered in blood, and the whole body was bruised. There were deep rope marks around the neck and abdomen. No family members came to claim the body. Chief Li immediately ordered the head of the local area, Shen Yunpu, to report the case to the local court for an autopsy, pending a thorough investigation and arrest of the perpetrator.</p>
<h3>Yu Jingyu's Appeal Rejected</h3>
<p>Yu Jingyu of Haimen, acting as a member of the 20th sub-division of the second district, sued Wu Jianguang, Wang Zhenhai, Wang Yonghai, and the sons of the deceased Chai Wenzhong, Cai Gao and Cai Fa, astrologer of having made false and deceptive accusations and fraud for financial gain in the Special District Court. In the initial trial, all five defendants were found not guilty. Yu appealed the verdict to the collegiate bench. Following the conclusion of interrogations, Judge Xu Jiashi, along with Assessors Sun Yuan and Ge Zitan, ascended the bench in the First Criminal Court yesterday afternoon. Only the defendant Wu Jianguang was present; the plaintiff Yu Jingyu and the remaining defendants were absent. Judge Xu then announced the verdict, rejecting the appeal.</p>
<h3>The Wharf Management Office Streamlines City Docks</h3>
<p>Expelling Gangs: Ensuring Traveler Safety</p>
<p>The Nanshi Wharf Management Office of the Shanghai Port Authority has made considerable efforts to streamline the Nanshi area wharfs. Since the Port Authority took over the Chaonan Wharf at the 16th Bund, a patrol team has been stationed there, dedicated to protecting merchants and travelers at the wharfs and eliminating old malpractices. The six-gang party, the eight-gang party, the sixteen-gang party, the thirty-two-gang party, the seventy-two-gang party, all of whom relied on the wharfs for survival, have all been expelled. Each time a ship docks, the patrol team is stationed on the shore, prohibiting anyone from standing on the wharf until the passengers have disembarked. Only then are porters allowed to board the ship to transport goods, following regulations and maintaining order, with no discrepancies or thefts occurring. Merchants and travelers alike applaud this achievement, marking a new era for Chinese ports. According to Xu Shichuan, the director of the Nanshi Wharf Management Office, and Gao Erde, the leader of the patrol team, efforts will be made to improve the Nanshi area wharfs to create a model wharf for the entire country.</p>
<h3>The Fuqing Steamer Case Concludes with Release</h3>
<p>The Fuqing steamer of the Fuxing Company, which originally operated the Xinghua-Quanzhou route, was previously involved in a lawsuit due to financial disputes at the management office. The Jianghai Customs was ordered to detain the steamer pending the legal proceedings. Since the Fuqing steamer was detained, it had been out of service for a long time. The lawsuit concluded yesterday with a ruling to release the ship and allow it to resume operations as usual. Yesterday afternoon, the Fuxing Company requested the Shanghai Customs to release the Fuqing steamer, which the Customs granted, immediately ordering its release. The company is preparing to resume its Xinghua route.</p>
<h3>The Hongkou Epidemic Hospital Closes</h3>
<p>Decision to Raise Funds to Build a Building</p>
<p>The Hongkou Epidemic Hospital has been in operation since July of this year. Initially, it was relatively quiet, but unexpectedly, the epidemic intensified in the autumn. The first person in Shanghai diagnosed with true cholera (Xia Fugou) was examined by the hospital. The situation was extremely dangerous, but he was successfully cured. The hospital has a good track record, saving countless lives. Recently, due to the cool weather, the epidemic has subsided. The hospital officially announced its closure yesterday and held a concluding meeting. The meeting was chaired by the medical director, who reported that the epidemic was mild in the summer but intensified in the autumn. A total of over 2,600 people received treatment, an increase of one-third compared to previous years. Among them, only twenty-five people were diagnosed with true cholera, all of whom were successfully cured and discharged. The hospital has repeatedly received plaques and newspaper acknowledgments from grateful patients. The Municipal Health Bureau has also sent staff to visit and provide guidance daily, expressing satisfaction. The administrative director then reported a summary of income and expenses, stating that Hongkou is a semi-industrial area, and most residents are poor. The hospital has been operating for three terms. Given the increasing number of patients seeking treatment each year, and the hospital's land has been purchased and drawings have been made, there is an urgent need to build a hospital building to avoid the annual cost of building reed sheds and thatched huts (six to seven hundred yuan) and the inconvenience and losses of storing items here and there. After lengthy discussions, it was decided that the directors would first raise funds for the construction of the building. If a certain amount is raised, another meeting will be held to discuss the progress.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Complain of Hardship</h3>
<p>Meng Jinchen and other representatives of rickshaw pullers in Zhabei stated that life has become increasingly difficult in recent years. Renting rickshaws is a hardship, and their earnings are meager. The rickshaw owners are unsympathetic and want to increase the rent by ten cents. Some people even plan to monopolize the rickshaws in the name of public associations, which is intolerable to the rickshaw pullers. They have drafted a declaration and sent it to various organizations and groups, requesting assistance.</p>

<h3>Corpse of a Child Found in a Sack in Xiaopu</h3>
<p>At around 8 AM yesterday morning, a small sack was discovered next to the road on Fangbanqiao West Milu Road in the French Concession. There was something bulging inside. When people opened it, they found the corpse of a recently born child, completely naked and already dead. A crowd gathered to watch, all saying that they did not know who had abandoned it on the roadside, which was immoral. The local merchants ordered someone to send the corpse and the sack to the Tongren Fuyuantang for burial.</p>
<h3>Three Suicide Attempts by Jumping into the River, All Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>At around 5 PM yesterday afternoon, a patrol officer from post number 1779 of the Old Concession Police Station on Fourth Road saw someone jump into the river in an attempt to commit suicide. He immediately ordered a boatman to rescue the person and transport him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It was learned that the person who jumped into the river was Li Hesheng from Liyang, 34 years old. He was attempting suicide due to economic pressures. At around 6 PM the night before last, he jumped into the river at the Old Zha Bridge, but was also rescued by a boatman. This was his third suicide attempt by jumping into the river since coming to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Negotiations to Stop Disrupting the Price of Almond Shao</h3>
<p>Ling Yongde will File a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Recently, the Mid-Autumn Festival was celebrated according to the lunar calendar. People in society, unable to break old customs, still gave each other domestic almond shao as gifts. Therefore, there were many buyers on that day. Among them, a customer went to Yihe Garden to buy wine and was greatly dissatisfied after inquiring about the price. He said, "We are going out of our way to come here, wanting to get a little discount. Now, your factory's own product is more expensive than the one sold on the market by five cents. That is extremely unfair." Ling Yongde, the factory owner, heard this and, believing that it was related to the future of the business, immediately treated the customer with courtesy and asked about the truth. He learned that the Taichang Wine Store on Fada Road also sold the same wine. He was deeply concerned that unscrupulous merchants were imitating it, so he went there to investigate the truth. Later, he saw that the wine being sold was indeed a product of his factory. He asked a fellow partner at Taixing, who said that the retail price for small-scale almond shao on the market was 25 cents, while this store only sold it for 20 cents. When asked about the source, he said it was delivered by a manager surnamed Hu. Ling had no choice but to return to the factory to check the books. There was no wholesale shipment to Taixing. At this point, he filed a report with the Yangshupu Police Station, requesting an investigation. After receiving the report, the police chief, considering the case to be related to the credibility of the business community, and noting that the store dared to privately receive goods from an unknown source, and sold them at a lower price, which was highly suspicious, immediately ordered Detective Ge Futing, Wang Tongpo, and a foreign detective to go to the French Concession Police Station, report the situation, and then go together to the Taixing Wine Store at 371 Fada Road to confiscate the stolen wine and several declaration letters and brochures. They took them back to the police station for safekeeping. It is now known that Ling Yongde, the manager of Yihe Garden, believes that Wu Baolian, the manager of Taixing Wine Store, should not have undermined the industry by disrupting the selling price of products. He is said to be filing a criminal lawsuit, requesting the court to handle the matter according to law.</p>
<h3>The Wusong Jide Charity Hall's Re-election Fails</h3>
<p>The Wusong Jide Charity Hall was established in the eighth year of the Daoguang era of the Qing Dynasty. Recently, due to poor management, it was reported to the Social Bureau by local people. After the Social Bureau issued an order for the hall to re-elect its members, the board of directors of the hall selected thirty-five candidates from among the Wu Song gentry and merchants, and reported them to the bureau. At the same time, the candidates were notified to attend the re-election at the Wusong Municipal Office on the afternoon of the seventh. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the day before yesterday, Qiangsheng, a special representative sent by the Social Bureau, went to Song and went to the hall, saying that among the candidates submitted for this re-election, it was found that seven or eight people, including Yu Weigan, had either bad habits, misappropriated public funds, or been subjected to administrative penalties. Therefore, this re-election was deemed inappropriate and was ordered to be suspended temporarily. The list of local gentry and merchants should first be submitted to the Social Bureau for approval before scheduling a new date for the re-election. Therefore, yesterday, the municipal party department, unaware of this beforehand, still sent Wang Lide as a representative to Song to supervise the situation. Yu Weigan, the former executive director of the hall, also claimed illness and did not attend, so there was no way to contact him. After Liu Youtong of the Municipal Administration Bureau informed him of the details, he returned to Shanghai to report the situation.</p>
<h3>A Woman Hit and Killed by a Shanghai-Nanjing Train</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 7th), a villager, about fifty years old, wearing a long blue cloth gown and a dark-colored vest, was walking on the 106th bridge, Suzhou Dingwai Yangqi. The Shanghai-Nanjing train, traveling at high speed for the eighth time, sounded its whistle as a warning. However, the villager turned a deaf ear and was hit in the head by the train, spitting out fresh blood and dying on the spot. Later, the staff on the train notified the Suzhou stationmaster, who ordered the local bailiff to call for someone to claim the corpse.</p>
<h3>A Fire in the Zaojulu area Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 11 AM, a fire broke out at the home of Mrs. Zhang Zhou (20 years old) at 1 Fuxing Lane, Zaojulu, Nanshi. While cooking lunch with a foreign stove, Mrs. Zhang Zhou accidentally spilled kerosene, causing a sudden fire. The fire brigades of all districts in Nanshi heard the alarm and rushed to the scene to put out the fire. After about an hour, at 11:30 AM, the fire was finally extinguished. One floor was burned down, and the furniture and belongings inside were completely destroyed, causing a loss of over a thousand yuan. Mrs. Zhang Zhou, who was the cause of the fire, was arrested by the Second District Headquarters and questioned. The matter is being investigated further.</p>

<h3>The New Italian Consul General Will Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Count Ziano: Expected to Arrive on Double Tenth Day</p>
<p>The newly appointed Italian Consul General to Shanghai, Count Ziano (son of the Italian Minister of Communications), and his wife, Edda (eldest daughter of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini), departed from Rome at 10:40 PM on September 9th, heading to Brindisi (an Italian port on the southeast coast) to board the Lloyd Triestino's De Fore (Tevere). They are expected to arrive in Shanghai around October 10th. Those who saw them off at the Rome station, in addition to Prime Minister Mussolini and Minister of Communications Ziano, included various dignitaries from the Fascist Party and the political world, senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others. Zhu Shuangzhai, the secretary of the Chinese Legation in Italy, also went to the station to greet them and presented Countess Ziano with a bouquet of flowers, wishing them a safe journey. The Countess shook hands and thanked him before boarding the train.</p>
<p>Count Ziano was born in Livorno on March 18, 1903. He graduated from the Faculty of Law at the University of Rome on April 20, 1922. On July 21, 1925, he passed the diplomatic and consular examinations and began studying at the Ministry. He was later assigned to the Brazilian Legation as a trainee. On January 10, 1929, he was awarded the Italian Crown Order, Fifth Class. On April 30, 1926, he was promoted to attaché at the Legation. On June 19, 1926, he was transferred to the Argentine Legation. On March 14, 1927, he returned to the Ministry to work. On April 1, 1927, he was promoted to deputy secretary of the Legation.

She excels in sports such as playing ball and horse riding. In Rome, she often rode horses in the park with her father. The U.S. Prime Minister Mussolini sent his fast son-in-law to China, and we can see that he attach great importance to China, since China is a new country, sending young element who has a new idea to the extent the economic relations between Italy and China. We deeply hope the economic relation will continue to become political cooperation.</p>
<h3>The South Vietnamese Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Requests Joint Resistance Against the Harsh Passport Law</h3>
<p>Willing to Back the Chinese Overseas Federation</p>
<p>The Chinese Overseas Federation received a telegram from the South Vietnamese Chinese General Chamber of Commerce yesterday: "To the Shanghai Chinese Republic Chinese Overseas Federation, respectfully, we received your respectful telegram. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' promulgation of measures for issuing passports and temporary measures for issuing return passports and visas for foreigners coming to China, stipulating a fee of six yuan per passport and two yuan for stamps, with annual renewal and payment, is a harsh and cumbersome law that is unprecedented in ancient and modern times. It makes it difficult for overseas Chinese to endure. Overseas Chinese abroad are forced to make a living abroad due to the poverty of their motherland, enduring unequal treatment from foreigners and bearing heavy taxes from foreigners. We hope that the government of the motherland can help alleviate our suffering. Unexpectedly, the government has done the opposite. The so-called revolutionary diplomacy implemented by the government in recent years to amend treaties has not brought any benefit to overseas Chinese. Instead, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has taken the opportunity to implement measures for paying high fees for passports, greatly increasing the suffering of overseas Chinese. How can overseas Chinese not be disheartened by this? The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' harsh treatment of overseas Chinese and its exploitation of overseas Chinese is almost worse than what overseas Chinese receive from foreigners. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is like a butcher, and overseas Chinese are like fish on the chopping board. How much blood and sweat do overseas Chinese have? We are already groaning under the oppression of foreigners and have not received the help of our country. How can we have the strength to fill the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' insatiable desires and meet its greedy demands? Most of the overseas Chinese here are poor and powerless, paying large amounts of head taxes and various heavy taxes to foreigners every year. There are often those who cannot pay and are deported. Suddenly, upon hearing of this harsh law, we were extremely agitated, and the people are in uproar. In addition to submitting another report to the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee to forward it to the National Government, requesting the abolition of this harsh law by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we respectfully request that your Federation earnestly uphold the interests of all overseas Chinese and represent the public opinion of all overseas Chinese, continuing the struggle to the end. Our Chamber of Commerce respectfully represents all the overseas Chinese in Vietnam to be your backing. The Vietnamese Chinese General Chamber of Commerce bows, with cold seal. It is heard that the Chinese Overseas Federation will ask the government for approval of its request, ordering the Ministry of Finance and the two provincial governments of Guangdong and Guangxi to remit 100,000 yuan to relieve the victims of the Kunxiong fire, and that the Relief Committee will also remit 10,000 yuan, which shows that the government has not forgotten the overseas Chinese. The harsh passport law privately enacted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is hated by the entire overseas Chinese community, and the government will certainly be able to consider the public opinion of all overseas Chinese and abolish the law. We plan to work together to appeal again, to alleviate the difficulties of the Soviet overseas Chinese."</p>
<h3>Revised Regulations on Handling Fees at the Jianghai Customs</h3>
<p>Effective October 7th, the old regulations of the Jianghai Customs, including the measurement and inspection procedures for unloading goods from foreign and inland river steamers, have been in place for over sixty years. Now, with the approval of the Superintendent of Customs upon submission by the Inspector General of Customs, new regulations have been revised and implemented starting yesterday. Detailed regulations on the collection of all handling fees are posted inside the customs office. Various shipping companies and customs brokers can request copies for review. However, the new regulations on customs warehouse bonded fees have not yet been implemented, it is said.</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Negotiation Regarding the Sinking of the "Xin Kang"</h3>
<p>The family association of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Xin Kang" steamer, which was sunk by the Japanese Mail Steamship Company's "Tatsuno Maru" on July 21st last year in the waters off Chengshan Cape in Shandong, resulting in the drowning of many people and the loss of millions of dollars in property, held a meeting the other day. To date, it has been over a year, and the China Merchants Bureau and the bereaved family association have repeatedly telegraphed the National Government, requesting serious negotiations. However, due to the Japanese side's lack of sincerity, there have been no results whatsoever. Subsequently, the China Merchants Bureau's diplomatic approach failed to resolve the matter. Therefore, they submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications for approval to proceed legally in accordance with international practice. They have already filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai Special District Local Court. The bereaved family association has also taken steps to achieve the goal of consoling the deceased and providing for the living. They have already hired Sheng Zhen as their lawyer to act as their litigation agent and have filed a lawsuit with the Special District Court. However, due to litigation costs, the formal submission of the petition has not yet occurred. They are currently applying for financial assistance. The bereaved family association specifically convened a committee meeting the other day to discuss litigation issues. Standing Committee Member Mr. Zhu reported on the association's affairs. Following this, the matter of pursuing litigation was discussed. It was stated that all litigation procedures and evidence lists were complete. However, due to a lack of funds, they could not proceed. As this concerns national rights and the lives of the people, they should request assistance from the court. A resolution was passed to this effect, and Committees Zhu and Zhou were appointed to negotiate all matters with Lawyer Sheng. Next, the issue of providing relief to impoverished families facing livelihood difficulties was discussed. It was resolved to negotiate with the China Merchants Bureau for an allocation of funds for relief. The issue of the association's finances was not discussed. Due to financial difficulties, there are issues regarding the operation of the association. The various committee members will find ways to maintain the association. Finally, other association affairs were discussed before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>News on the Audit of Waterworks Accounts</h3>
<p>Yu Xizong, He Dekui, Pan Xulun, and others, representatives of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement, have been auditing the accounts of the Shanghai Waterworks Company for several days. They have roughly completed the audit of the accounts from 1915 to 1929 and are currently conducting a detailed review. The Chinese Ratepayers' Association considers the budget for the first half of this year to be particularly important and has sent a letter to the Shanghai Waterworks Company requesting that the profit and loss statement and balance sheet for the six-month period from January 1st to June 30th of this year be submitted to the association for review. It is said that the representatives originally intended to complete the audit within a week, but now they must extend the deadline pending the receipt and review of the budget statement for the first half of this year.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Anti-Opium Society to All Anti-Opium Comrades Nationwide</h3>
<p>The 7th Anti-Opium Movement Week Concludes. The 7th National Anti-Opium Movement Week has been held for a week. The enthusiasm of the movement in this city and other places has been detailed in various newspapers. The China National Anti-Opium Society, in order to request anti-opium organizations and enthusiastic individuals to continue their efforts in the anti-opium movement, specifically records its letter to comrades of all anti-opium organizations as follows:</p>
<p>All Comrades of National Anti-Opium Organizations, Greetings: The 7th National Anti-Opium Movement Week has concluded. Looking back on the movement during this week, it originated in Shanghai and spread throughout the north, south, east, and west of the country, reaching far and wide. Although there are certainly cases where the interior was unable to hold events consistently due to the impact of military affairs or political instability, those who participated in the movement still covered the entire country, and the situation was increasingly enthusiastic. This shows that those who advocate for opium prohibition share the same heart and the same principle, which cannot be suppressed by any force. With every fraction of development in public opinion, the hope for opium prohibition increases by a fraction. We have been hoarse and exhausted from engaging in the anti-opium movement, yet the scourge of opium has been rampant and has not been eliminated, which is inevitably disheartening. However, our efforts should not be swayed by success or failure. We must set a firm goal and make persistent efforts to achieve success. Today, the Anti-Opium Movement Week has concluded, but the anti-opium movement does not end with it. We should expand the scope, extend the time, promote the spirit of Anti-Opium Week, and continue the work of Anti-Opium Week. With a spirit of fearlessness, we will engage in a movement to save the country. The main points announced during this Anti-Opium Week are all the only correct path for our work. If we want to wash away national humiliation, we must first reject opium. If we want to talk about opium prohibition, we must emphasize abiding by the law. Other aspects, such as improving families and strengthening physiques, should also eliminate the harm of opium. Eliminating famine to enrich the people's food also requires eliminating opium seedlings all over the land. National wealth and a strong populace are closely related to the success or failure of opium prohibition. This is the principle of anti-opium and also the key to saving the country. Our association uses the combination of the people to create an invincible shield of public opinion. We are willing to use our position as representatives of the people to offer sincere advice to the authorities, earnestly ensuring that this dying opportunity can have hope of revival. The people would be fortunate, the country would be fortunate. The China National Anti-Opium Society humbly announces.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Yesterday, your newspaper published an article stating that the Cui Clan's Banxiangting had been robbed repeatedly, with Zhao Yichun as the owner of the Cui Clan's Banxiangting. Upon reading this, I was shocked and surprised. The Cui Clan's Banxiangting Pharmacy was established solely by my late father, Ji Yun, and has been in operation for more than thirty years. None of my paternal relatives or uncles have any shares in it, let alone a Zhao person with a different surname. I believe that your reporter heard rumors that were untrue, leading to this error. Therefore, I request a correction and hope that it will be published.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Cui Yi, Owner of the Cui Clan's Banxiangting</p>
<p>October 7th</p>

<h3>Saturday - Hongkou Park</h3>
<p>— Kui En</p>
<p>On a Saturday afternoon, everything seems to be vibrant, especially Hongkou Park, which is close to the city but still retains its natural beauty. It further reveals how people, weary from the busyness of life, have an even greater interest in nature. Their emotions are very intense and lively, yet very natural. The verdant grass is covered by a cerulean sky. The trees planted around the lawn seem to be resting without moving. Although there is a gentle breeze with warm sunlight from time to time, it only sways slightly, shakes a few times, and then drops a few yellow leaves to avoid spoiling the breeze's mood. This is a day near the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar. Because of the fierce, chilling winds that have been blowing for days, some people are hibernating at home, others are busy with the work they must do to make a living, and friends with nothing to do would rather spend a few cents to go to the movies. Who would be willing to appreciate the bleak autumn scenery? But today is different. The chilling wind has turned into a gentle and lovely breeze. A large crowd of people is moving around in the park, which is enough to show that people's interest is particularly strong today.</p>
<p>Qin's nature is very fond of nature, so every day she has to spend a few copper coins to take the tram to Hongkou Park, which is two or three miles away, to breathe some fresh air and appreciate some natural scenery. Today's beauty, of course, cannot be an exception for her.</p>
<p>She always goes to the park alone. She especially does not like to go with friends of the opposite sex, because she is most afraid of being stared at by others with strange eyes, which is not as free as being alone. She likes to quietly appreciate the natural scenery, the chirping of insects and birds, the leaping of fish in the water, ... everything ... is good material for her to enjoy alone. She grew up in the countryside, so she is very attentive to those Japanese people fishing and to the fact that they have this special right.</p>
<p>Because she likes fishing the most. She often stands next to them watching them fish. Her eyes are very focused on the mark on the fishing rod line. As long as that mark moves slightly, she knows that a fish has come to eat the bait. At that time, her emotions are very tense, and her heart is beating. However, when the Japanese fisherman very casually pulls up his fishing rod, it disappoints her again. She despises the clumsiness of the Japanese and their inability to fish. She recalls how well she used to fish when she lived in the countryside, how she held many fish in her hands on the way home, thinking about how happy her family would be when they saw how many fish she had caught. She was so surprised that her heart was pounding, and she could not wait to take three steps at a time to quickly present these many fish to her father, who had the same hobby as her. ... These memories are enough to make her feel that her skills are now itching. Really, the Japanese seem to really not know how to fish. They throw the fragrant bait into the water with a loud thud. She thinks that the fish in the water have long escaped following this huge sound. Where would they come back to eat the bait? The configuration of the fragrant bait, the position of placing the fishing rod, everything is enough to make her feel that the fishing skills of the Japanese are inferior to her. She remembers that Japan is a famous aquatic country, and aquatic products are their major products. Could it be that they only know how to use brutal methods of capture and do not know how to use civilized fishing methods? This is probably the manifestation of the imperialistic characteristics they possess. However, she also thinks that Jiang Taigong's fishing is "those who are willing will be hooked." "The Japanese are fishing or are imitating the ancient culture of our country.</p>
<p>Two Japanese children are playing in front of her. She stares hard at these two Japanese children. She wants to extract from them some model of their so-called imperialism. They are carrying schoolbags, and she is speculating that in the few national textbooks inside, printed with Japanese characters, there must be geography and history subjects. In the history textbook, there is an article explaining how Japan took Manchuria from China. In the geography textbook, there is also a map that includes Manchuria in China's territory into Japan's territory. When a Japanese teacher is lecturing on the podium, how attentively the general little imperial citizens are listening. ... The sound of Japanese soldiers shooting targets outside the park continues to ring incessantly, making her feel that this is not speculation at all but a fact.</p>
<p>It's time for dinner. She is still reluctant to go back, because she feels that life here seems to be particularly meaningful...</p>

The 8-50 model uses a bore of 3 7/16 inches and a stroke of 4 1/4 inches to provide power. The displacement area is 220.7 cubic inches, and it can produce 77 horsepower at 3,000 revolutions per minute.</p>
<p>The engine of the 8-60 wheelbase has a bore of 3 1/16 inches and a stroke of 4 5/8 inches. The displacement area is 272.6 cubic inches, and it generates 90 horsepower at 3,000 revolutions per minute.</p>
<p>The engines of the 8-80 and 8-90 wheelbases both have a bore of 3 5/16 inches and a stroke of 5 inches. The displacement area is 344.8 cubic inches, and it generates 104 horsepower at 2,800 revolutions per minute. The capabilities, sturdiness, and durability of the above four types of motors are all extremely superior.</p>
<p>The oil temperature regulator invented by Buick engineers is the first of its kind in automobile mechanical equipment. Engine oil and engine sliding surfaces often lose their effectiveness due to thermal or climatic influences, often expanding and contracting and failing. The advantage of this device is that the engine oil quality does not change, the oil volume does not decrease, and the power is not lost in cold winter or hot summer or under intense driving. The structure is shaped like a small water tank and is in the heat dissipation system between the water pump and the cylinder wall. The oil is ejected from the pump, passes through this gateway, and dissipates when it flows into the engine. In cold weather, the engine oil is frozen and cold. The oil temperature regulator can heat the cold oil and maintain its daily temperature. The heating method relies on the gentle warmth of water vapor and special circulation to allow the oil to flow into the various moving parts of the machine."</p>
<p>Pressure is applied to the general sliding surface, crank journal, connecting rod sliding surface, rocker arm rest, timing gear, and front electrical system sliding surface directly, quickly, and thoroughly. There is also an oil filter and an eccentric ventilation system, each of which constantly keeps the oil quality clean.</p>
<p>The new Buick's eccentric shafts all have five large general sliding surfaces. The force of each shaft is balanced, and the micrometer is inside the eccentric box. The completion is not committed by dirt, which is commonly installed on the outside of the engine. Dirt accumulates and hinders work from time to time.</p>
<p>Buick engineers have learned from three years of testing that combining these five large and strong eccentric shaft tiles with steel ring balancers can save a lot of effort. It can also enlarge the sliding surface area and make it more solid and durable. And its oiling is also the most satisfactory.</p>
<p>Dual carburetor system is available for engines of models 8-65, 8-80 and 8-90. Whether it is a fast car or a slow car, climbing or accelerating, this can obtain super performance. Each carburetor supplies the gasoline to four cylinders. The gasoline is sent from the intake pipe, which is simple, reliable, and exceptionally economical. There is no need to add spark plugs, ignition coils, or other components.</p>
<p>Buick automobiles' valve timing and special air purifiers eliminate all intake noise and produce full power. Buick's overhead valves also make the car run silently. Forged iron pistons are light, strong, and do not shake at all. They will not be damaged after long-term use. The oil flow in the fan shaft is constant. The oil is ejected from the gear pump, which is of course very different from manual oil injectors. The crank driver is a direct gear type.</p>
<p>The transmission box of the new Buick is automatically adjusted and lubricated for long-term use, so there is no need to worry about it often. Only a slight adjustment of the foot pedal is required. Models 8-50 and 8-60 are equipped with single-disc transmission boxes, while models 8-80 and 8-90 are equipped with double-disc transmission boxes, so their heavy duty is also greater.</p>
<p>Gear transmission is a special product of this year's New Buick. Except for the 8-50 model, the other three models have it. This type of setup is mostly only available in high-priced automobiles. Today, the New Buick is both an excellent car and reasonably priced, and it also has the above equipment, which is extremely rare.</p>
<p>This transmission is automatically handled and has no collisions. There is no sound when shifting gears, which is incredibly convenient. It can be used easily at any speed, and its structure is solid and can overcome all kinds of difficulties. In emergencies, such as going uphill or downhill, the gear can be stretched and contracted at any time, and shifting gears is very fast.</p>
<p>The gear transmission is a simple and sturdy organization. It operates directly and does not need to be adjusted. The first speed and reverse gears are standard spiral gears. The gears of the second speed are all aligned on time. The same is true from the first gear to the second gear. The shifting order is not chaotic. Because there are spiral gear transmission boxes and conical friction interconnection mechanisms to control them, collisions are avoided.</p>
<p>Model 8-50 still uses the ordinary three-speed transmission. However, the rotating part of its transmission box is light and small, so its operation is also extremely flexible and without stagnation.</p>
<p>Worm-type and spiral-type driving gears are available for all models except 8-50, and they can be handled on the dashboard. Adding a movable front seat makes driving quite comfortable. The improvement of the car's system is also on par with other features. It is simple and powerful, and the position is spacious. At extremely fast speeds, the mechanical action of the "husband" type car system is very tenacious, reliable, agile, and flexible.</p>
<p>The famous Buick concentrated wheelbase oiling system is still retained. After repeated tests, this system is quite simple and flexible. The oiling work is fast. Because its oil injection mechanism is perfect, each wheelbase sliding surface has an oil pipe connected to it, and the oiling is very thorough without having to go through other parts.</p>
<p>The speed can be as high as 80 miles per hour. You can drive as fast or as slow as you like. It is incomparably stable. It is quiet and silent when driving fast. It is stable on the road. It is extremely reliable whether you are climbing a mountain or going downhill. The acceleration rate of the new engine is about 10 to 60 miles per hour, which is five seconds faster than other cars.</p>
<p>Buick engineers have given deep consideration to speed and have always been conservative and steady. Therefore, high speeds are not easily recommended. The average speed is 70 miles per hour for the 8-50 model, 75 miles per hour for the 8-60 model, and 84 miles per hour for the 8-80 and 8-90 models, which is quite stable.</p>
<p>The new cars all have prominent car bodies. Prominent craftsmanship has always been famous. Therefore, the car bodies and wheelbases of the New Buick are extremely strong and reliable and exquisitely beautiful. The entire frame project is also extremely tenacious and stable.</p>
<p>The interior design and craftsmanship of the New Buick are extremely exquisite, especially magnificent. The quality and color of the呢羢緞布 and edge rope leather are all excellent and beautiful.</p>
<p>The format and position of the car's control instruments are also very commensurate. Driving and riding in between is comfortable and enjoyable. The gear lever and hand brake lever have also been moved to the front, so the driver's leg position is larger than before. The vehicles driving on the right side have also been improved. The hand brake lever is on the left side of the gear lever. The accelerator pedal is quite in line with the position of the foot.</p>
<p>Among the New Buick's mechanical equipment, the most famous are the engine heat meter, water pressure gauge, simultaneous igniter and driver closer, 90-mile speedometer, toe-shaped accelerator pedal, and double-piece vacuum windshield wiper, which are installed on the 8-60, 8-80, and 8-90 sedans. Others are single-piece. Direct and indirect dashboard lights and double-system windshields for convertibles.</p>
<p>Other improvements include four-suspension rubber engine seats, improved water tank seats, new exhaust system, new full-piece rear axle housing, strong frame, new shock absorbers and seats, improved car body seats, new water tank cap, new chrome-plated car top chain nails, complete chrome-plated lighting equipment, new running board inlays and connectors, improved box frames, new driving rudder wheels, new dashboards, rubber-wrapped accelerator pedals, new carpets, and rich and luxurious seats.</p>
<h3>89,000-Mile Automobile Honeymoon Trip</h3>
<p>— Pei</p>
<p>Goodyear Tires Traverse a Long Distance</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Allen, who live at 139 Ninety-eighth Street in New York, once took a two-year world honeymoon trip by car. They recently returned to the United States from abroad. The situations they encountered during their trip included revolutions, floods, and unbearably hot deserts. The car they used traveled 75,000 miles, and one of the Goodyear tires they prepared traveled as many as 40,000 miles.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Allen's car is no less than a home. The car has various camping utensils. No matter day or night, the car can be parked anywhere. It can be set up as a kitchen, dining room, and dressing room. In the evening, the cushions in the car can be slightly rearranged to form a comfortable bedroom.</p>
<p>Mr. Allen and Mrs. Allen met on the island of the Philippines and married in China. They set off from Shanghai in March 1928 for their honeymoon. Their total trip totaled 89,000 miles, of which 16,000 miles were spent in China.</p>
<p>The motivation for Mr. and Mrs. Allen to take this long trip is also quite interesting to talk about. The car used for the trip was assembled in China. The car body was made by Chinese people under the direction of Mr. Allen. Mr. Allen said that he found a rudder wheel, so he decided to build a car.</p>
<p>They first took a boat from Shanghai to Manila. After traveling on the island of the Philippines, they took a boat to Singapore, and then drove from Malaya to Penang. After arriving there, they changed boats to Calcutta and drove around India. When the first revolution in Afghanistan broke out, Mr. and Mrs. Allen happened to be driving there at this time. To ensure safety, Mrs. Allen traveled alone by plane. Mr. Allen drove forward on a winding road to avoid the attention of the revolutionaries. Mrs. Allen was arrested by revolutionaries at this time. She was seriously injured in the arm when she escaped. Mr. Allen was shot three times while escaping, which was also very dangerous.</p>
<p>The second thing Mr. and Mrs. Allen experienced was the flood in Kashmir, northwestern India. At that time, the couple was driving for a three-month trip through the Indian desert to Balochistan, and then back to Mumbai. They bought a boat to Aden, Arabia, and then from the Suez Canal to the Red Sea, Cairo in Egypt, and then to Italy, France, 芳的卡羅, England, and finally took the "布蘭加利" boat directly back to their home in New York.</p>
<p>In short, what Mr. and Mrs. Allen experienced was two revolutions in China and one revolution in Afghanistan. Although there was no outbreak in India, the place they went was not far away either. Their honeymoon was not just a trip. They experienced things that travelers had never seen before and made large-scale hunts and visits to Indian kings. The only thing that made Mr. and Mrs. Allen often think of their hometown was that they carried an advertisement for Goodyear tires on their car during their long journey.</p>

<h3>1931 Studebaker Trucks to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Henry Motor Company, located at 883 Jing'an Temple Road in this city, has long been known for its excellent reputation as a manager of various Studebaker vehicles. It is heard that the company will have a large batch of new 1931 Studebaker freight trucks arriving in Shanghai. The vehicles are divided into four types: 8,000 pounds, 7,000 pounds, 6,000 pounds, and 5,000 pounds. The machinery is solid, durable, and inexpensive. There is nothing else like it. The number of people ordering is already endless.</p>
<p>Statistics</p>
<h3>Automobile Statistics of Various Countries</h3>
<p>— Zhuo</p>
<p>The total number of automobiles in the world has exceeded 24.5 million. The future increase is especially unlimited. The automobile's contribution to shortening the distance on land is truly great. However, the degree of development of transportation industries in various countries is different. The number of automobiles can always reveal the degree of development of the transportation industry. According to the "List of National Conditions of Various Countries" published by the Japan Cabinet Statistics Bureau, the number of automobiles in various countries is listed in detail. We can compare their statistics.</p>
<h3>Preparation for Learning to Drive a Car in Vienna</h3>
<p>The Vienna Police Department in Austria has recently adopted a "psychological machine" to test prospective car drivers. The illustration shows a test subject concentrating intently, hands on the small steering wheel, carefully guiding a pencil across a map of a heavily congested city street. The cylinder below the map is electrically powered, allowing it to rotate.</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>Of these, the United States ranks first. The US has a total of 19,954,347 automobiles. England ranks second, France third, and Canada fourth. Although Japan is also known as a major power, it only ranks 21st in the world. Japan only has 35,802 automobiles. As for China, it ranks 35th in the world, with fewer than 14,000 automobiles. The United States has more than 1,700 cars for every 10,000 people, while China has only three cars for every 10,000 people. How underdeveloped is China's automobile industry? Here is a translation of the Japanese Cabinet Statistics Bureau's statistics on automobiles in various countries around the world as a warning. Although the "Overview of National Conditions in Various Countries" published by the Japanese Cabinet Statistics Bureau was published in 1928, these global statistics still have considerable value.</p>

<h3>Automobile Industry Invents X-Ray Machine</h3>
<p>Diagnose Internal Car Problems Instantly</p>
<p>We are already familiar with X-rays for treating human illnesses. But now an X-ray machine has appeared in the automotive industry. Isn't this a wonderful story? This X-ray is specifically designed to diagnose automobile ailments.</p>
<p>The inventor of this car X-ray machine is the Automobile X-Ray Company. The method involves placing a mirror on a stand and connecting it electrically to various components inside the car. Any damage or defects will then appear on the mirror, even the smallest details. The car owner can see it at a glance. Otherwise, when a car breaks down, one is often unaware of the source of the problem, leading to blind searches that take a long time and make repairs impossible, delaying everything. Now, with this mirror, the problem can be identified instantly, which is a great convenience.</p>
<p>This machine weighs 26 pounds, is 3 feet 3 inches tall, and has a circular disk with a diameter of 14 inches. Many American modification companies and car owners are buying these machines to facilitate car maintenance. The benefits of X-rays to the automobile industry are undoubtedly significant.</p>
<p>The machine's disk is decagonal and contains six dials, each with electrical wires connected to a specific component, such as the carburetor and battery. If there is damage, a different phenomenon will appear on the dial. The repairman can then follow the instructions, making it easy to find the problem. The price of each machine is very low. It is currently being sold by the Lewis Brothers Company and will soon be shipped to the Far East for public demonstrations to promote its marvelous functions.</p>
