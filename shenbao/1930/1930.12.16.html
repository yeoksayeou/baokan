<h3>前鋒周報廿一期南心</h3>
<p>最近出版的前鋒周報第二十一期內容較以前更爲整齊取材的愼重實爲出版界所創餐它所以能夠使大多數讀者爭相誦讀這最大的起點是它具有正確的中心思想無論屬於文字的那方面均顯現着統一性的輪廓同時也是爲了讀者客觀的要求確定了一種以民族主義文藝爲中心的意識因此前鋒周報是成爲最有力的文藝刋物文字的生動更能把握着讀者整個的心這是極形顯明的事實這一期計載着五篇文章在實質上是更其展進的了（一）襄華的民族主義的戲劇論（二）蘇靈的邊疆之夜（三）張季平的「兩種不同的人類」（四）錦軒的談鋒「小說家與抄襲家」（五）爭波的續稿「兩個孤兒」這都是在其它刋物上不易多見的力作　　中國的劇壇眞是荒蕪得不堪舊的戲劇是充滿了出世的傳统的封建的思想這對於中國民族的發展是有莫大的妨碍在中國思想界正含有莫大的危機的期問有似這類的思想决不應灌輸於青年的腦筋中就是所謂改良國劇也不過是換湯不換藥的東西無論他改良到如何的程度但是這種濃烈的封建思想與傳統的意識總不能减輕以至全部的毁滅而添上一種向上的正確的人生觀這當然是不能辦到的旣然這様所謂改良國劇也不過是這麽一回事至於最近所流行着的話劇也是同様的使我們失望所謂中心思想更其是不正確的誘惑青年們走上惘迷的偏激的道路這更使我們痛心疾首這亦即是新劇没落的表象所以襄華的這篇「民族主義的戲劇論」委實値得我們的注意作者在起首就這様的寫着　　「中國的戲劇永遠不曾走上正確的軌道舊劇和文明戲固不必說即最近甚爲流行的話劇也是同様的迷惘地走上了末路這是一個顯明地擺在我們眼前的客觀的事實凡稍爲留心中國劇壇的人是誰也不會否認的　　「···在這長遠的時期舊劇和文明劇是早喪失了其時代的精神和藝術的價値在我們民族運動的浪潮高漲的今日這封建的殘存的屍骸當然是不容其再有立脚的餘地了至於話劇近來頗有幾個愛美劇社從這方面努力如沙士比亞的威尼斯商人柴霍甫的文舅舅田漢改譯的卡門等都曾公演於中國的舞台但因爲這些從事戲劇的人均不曾有正確意識又不能顧到我們民族覺醒的現在的客觀的需要所以有的搬些外國的貴族資産階級的劇本來有的把民族主義的劇本反改成標語口號的宣傳品結果都是成績毫無的歸於失敗了」像作者關於上列的發揮眞是針針見血淋漓盡緻的了的確擺在我們的眼前的中國戲劇是一個絕大的危機在稍有民族中心思想的人當然不能目覩中國戲劇就此沉淪下去那末「我們必須要打出一條血路開始我們民族主義的戲劇理論的建設襄華這篇據說長約二萬的巨論就是建設這理論的基礎最重要的「是不能容許有封建殘餘勢力的存在要廓清中國的劇壇」最初步的設論是須「怎样廓清劇壇的封建勢力」關於這一點作者所論尤爲透澈因爲篇幅所限恕我不能詳爲徵引其次應介紹於讀者之前的是蘇靈的詩了　　　「邊疆之夜」是描寫北國的風光戰士的高歌與及戰爭的情狀作者藝術的手腕很高超所以清澹的刻畫却含有深沉的意義在詩底技巧上也可以說是取得藝術最高之點無論在那一方而這首詩是使我們讀了感着意外的滿意例如　　酒盞高舉在戰士們的手握　　戰士們的心中正如熾火在爆燃　　在每雙沈毅的目光中丨　　都充藴着等待暴發的烈熖　　酒盞高舉在戰士們的手握　　戰士們對着這血色的酒液齊歌　　在今夜在今夜戰士們　　來痛飲下這血酒一盞　　到明晨太陽爬上了地線　　戰士們我們誓把暴敵攻陷　　像這様的詩是具有幽默而雄壯的　　氣分在各刋物上所發表的詩歌裏却是不易多見是的力作讀者們歌吟了上列兩節所徵引的詩句便能相信無疑的吧　　此外季平的嚴正批評錦軒的尖刻的談鋒爭波的流暢的譯稿都是必讀的力作關於這三篇文字的內容祗可讓讀者自已去欣賞的了</p>
<h3>初陽旬刋高偉</h3>
<p>第一二期　　杭州初陽社編輯　　自民族主義文藝運動的聲浪高唱入雲中國文藝界的形勢確是趨入於轉機中了不惟在發源根基地的上海展露了蓬勃的現象即在內地也震波而普及到本來內地的文藝界因着風氣的閉塞對於文藝思潮的隔閡甚深但這次民族主義文藝運動却不然竟一反過往的常態在不數月間已使內地的文藝界轉變入另一個方面而形成同様的企感着惟有民族主義文藝足以推翻一切舊有的潛勢力突破那病態的危機而創造新的局面這自然是因爲民族主義文藝在這時代裏爲全民族份子所殷切的要求所以一有發動便馬上羣起響應了我們第一看到的是南京文藝界的活躍由民族主義文藝運動的掀發而次第産生的各種刋物如開展月刋等在這裏也已有介紹過了現在來談談西子湖畔的文藝界情况是怎様我們畢竟也發現了一種民族主義的文藝刋物「初陽旬刋」過去杭州的文藝界誰都知道爲西子湖漣漪的陶醉所以說不到什麽意識的而現在乃一脚就踏上正確的文藝思想的道上委實覺得無限欣忭現在把我們見到的兩期置</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>出來介紹給一船讀者之前　　「在初陽旬刋」裏開首第一篇是「是們的話」這是表明「初陽」所站的立塲和態度的也是普通刋物問世時所不能免的開塲白他們對於歷史的時代的軌跡首先作一個相當的認識而後及於這時的一般要求　　時代先生挾着地球不斷地前這前進的軌跡即是人類的歷史人類在這動的激蕩的時波裏因爲生存的企求時時刻刻的追隨着時代的軌跡努力於改善生活的創造在另一方面血統生活語言文字宗敎及風俗習慣又區分人類爲若干具特徵的某團各集團的人羣因爲特徵的不同所以雖同時代的巨輸前進雖目的均求生存而在方法上則各自形成區異的軌跡這各具特徵的人民即是民族我們研究人類的一切過去現在未來第一步要有民族的認識即空間的觀念第二步要有時代的認識即時間的認識這時間與各空問的交义點即各民族的時代震源因了這様關係所以反映在文藝上的各民族亦因利害問題和因果問題的影響於是顯赫地産生相異之處了　　文藝是人類創造的一部份無論牠的形式與實質均在有意或無意的受了民族和時代的支配所以文藝在横的方面各民族的自具特質而在直的方面各民族的文藝又各隨時代而不斷的演進可憐沉醉的幻夢的藝術超然論者他們雖然停了時計坐在象牙塔裏作夢不知道自已呼吸之間容身之地仍逃不出民族與時代的掌心可笑無恥即普羅文藝論者他們不幸秉賦了民族性中頽的不長進的遺傳忘記了自已的民族看不見自已民族的特質做了異族的留聲機硬要毁滅了自已民族的一切竟自凟的反時代而在時代的巨輪下輾死了生命反民族而在民族的唾沬中淹没了自已的靈魂　　這是實在的話無論在那一種文藝思潮都該有民族的因素潛伏其内的祇要提倡者能夠不盲目能夠認識清楚客觀條件的需要緊記着「民族文藝的興衰是與民族意識的盛替民族國家的成功互爲因果的」而開展文藝的進程則必不至於陷入没落的危機的蓋「人類求進化的慾望於是促進新文藝的誕生」是故文藝總是逃不掉「適應民族生存與生活改善的企求」這個範疇很是明顯而過去中國文藝之所以不能有蓬勃的生氣就是誤跳進了黑暗面的圈子以致老是滯溜着不能闊步前進末了他們對於這新時代文藝的前途表示了這様的展望　　文學是時代的反映新時代的文學運動者是時代的前驅中國現代的中心文字是民族主義的文學牠的使命是喚起民族意識促進民族發皇發揚民族的奮鬥精神是赤白帝國主義夾攻中的被壓迫民族及殘餘封建勢力宗法勢力悛削下的被壓迫民族的慰藉者應援者與領導者偉大的時代已在我們的面前展開希望一切文藝作家及文藝興趣者一致站在民族的立塲上來完成這偉大的使命　　我相這様一來西子湖畔的風光雖任様充滿了純美的氲氛也必然能有所波動了吧我們當怎様地祈禱着「希望一切文藝和家及文藝興趣者一致站在民族的立塲上來完成這偉大的使命」這句話的實現　　在態度方面我們已看到了現在再來把這二期的内容作一個簡單的分析　　童蒙聖的「我對於文學的看法」先說明文學是屬於那一種學科這個問題我們從人類求生的根源上看來可以知道科學與技術根本是研究種種事物的現狀與功用的學問而藝術是指導人類應該過那種而意義的生活的東西但在過去却是很少有人這様加以說明的同様文學與時代這問題雖早已有人說過可是把時代與人類的生活聯在一起這件事也是時常被許多文學家忽略過去的至於作者的結論對於文學的看法認爲「文學這様科學就是用一種特殊的形式丨以美的文字傳逹作者的想像及感情指導一個時代的人類普遍的好的生活文學的界限便是指導時代中間人類的好的生活所以我們要判斷文的優劣决不能在形式上去刻劃」這就是說我們對於一件文學作品首在要顧到它的内在的實質的表現　　不過覺得很可惜的在這二期内是不能看到有一篇完整的創作發表亡羊譯的「村莊的畫家」是匃牙利Garolony的原著這篇並没有多大的意味只是那種淡逸的筆調很輕散地叙述下來在譯筆方面談來亦不見怎様流暢假如純粹以民族主義文藝的觀點來解剖這篇「村莊的畫家」我以爲我們對於外國文學的介紹眼光尙須深遠些　　在詩歌方面這二期中都佔據着很多篇幅本來詩歌的表現情的爆發是最强烈不過的但在這幾首中屬於詩的情操尙缺乏所謂美的條件似乎尙該加以修養哩白雲的「初陽」大概就是象徵了「初陽旬刋」　　深夜沉沉星月缺　　慘霧悽風亦凝結　　萬物凋殘將盡死　　魔火鬼燈時滅　　於此時際　　東方漸漸升起初陽了　　她用麗熾的流波　　愛憐的燭照萬方　　說道　　「我没有好貢獻　　我只有點熱和光」　　綜觀在内容方面固然未能認爲充實的但也差强能過得去吧在一運動纔開始的時候糼稚是不免的只要决心正如「只要有點熱和光」積極地努力改進下去自然愈益健全起來我希望「初陽旬刋」的諸位作者决不要有所頽墮這於民族性的表揚也是很有關係的所謂好譽還是該由自已建設起來的總之爲了要完成我們的使命努力是第一要緊</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>American Commerce Report</h3>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce released its business report for this year, stating that although the American economy has experienced a period of exhaustion, it is still optimistic. According to statistics, the national product and commercial activity results for a fiscal year are excellent. However, it also stated that the turmoil in the trading market in 1929 was the cause of the decline of the national commerce, resulting in a sharp reduction in imports and exports. Therefore, the so-called optimism must be very limited. With the wealth of the United States, it may not feel much pain even if it is temporarily affected by the trend. However, if continuous financial turmoil continues to exert pressure, it will be enough to make the authorities helpless. Last year's turmoil in the stock exchange already had such a significant impact on trade. Now, the turmoil in the banking industry is following closely and is expanding daily, with loopholes being exposed frequently. The impact on commerce must be even greater than last year's turmoil in the stock exchange. The U.S. Department of Commerce report may have been written before the outbreak of the banking turmoil, so it is still mostly optimistic. We will further observe the measures to save this commercial downturn, and the only way is to pay attention to trade with China. Therefore, it is very concerned about the proposal to increase tax rates in China. An American telegram said that exports to China have been greatly affected recently due to the sharp drop in silver prices. The Department of Commerce is very worried that the result of China's tax increase will further reduce the number of American goods going to China. The U.S. Department of Commerce's worries are not unreasonable. However, international trade is based on the principle of fairness. The new tax rules of the United States have already increased tax rates. After being opposed by European countries, although there have been statements that it can be modified, it has not been realized. It is expected that other countries will also increase tax rates. It is not necessary to ask whether China will take this action. Domestic News Brief Two</p>
<h3>Abolishing Likin on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen issued a circular stating: Nanjing Finance Minister Song Ziwen issued a circular stating that all newspapers are aware that the abolition of likin and all taxes similar to likin will be implemented on January 1st of the 20th year of the Republic of China. No province may request an extension for any reason. The Central Executive Committee's Third Session of the Fourth Plenary Meeting has already made a resolution and issued an order to the Executive Yuan to forward it to the Ministry for strict compliance. Now that the deadline is approaching, it is necessary to strictly supervise and implement it. Orders have been issued to the finance departments of various provinces, special finance commissioners, railway cargo tax bureaus, parcel tax bureaus, the Inspector General of Customs, and the supervisors of various maritime customs to ensure that all likin nationwide, as well as unified taxes, unified surcharges, special taxes, commodity taxes, railway cargo taxes, parcel taxes, landing taxes, and all other taxes and surcharges of a likin nature that have been renamed from likin, as well as ordinary customs duties outside the fifty-li range of the customs and other inland ordinary customs duties, and national border import and export taxes collected on land borders, except for the sub-port tax and re-import tax, etc., should all be permanently abolished by December 31st of this year. From January 1st of the 20th year, the above-mentioned collection agencies must not exist under any name. If anyone delays for reasons, establishes names under false pretenses, acts against orders, or seeks personal gain, they are deliberately violating orders and laws, which is intolerable and will be abandoned by public opinion. All my comrades should know that the establishment of this likin system was originally an expedient measure. Later, due to poor implementation, it deteriorated, and various miscellaneous taxes and surcharges similar to likin emerged one after another, harming the country and harming the people, and becoming a source of all evils. In order to realize the reform policy, the government will fundamentally eliminate this long-standing malpractice and follow the teachings of the late Premier to adapt to the requirements of the times and formulate good tax systems to start anew with the people. The Ministry is in charge of the national economy and sales, and the military affairs have just been settled. It is time for construction, and the treasury revenue will inevitably decrease sharply, and the deficit is self-evident. However, in order to relieve the suffering of the people and the great plan of the party and the country, the matter is imperative and there is no turning back. No matter how difficult it is, we must personally practice and implement the advocacy. On the one hand, we will actively reorganize the budget and strive to take into account the national economic and financial needs and promote benefits as much as possible. I hope that the sages of the country will give assistance and guidance to correct the deficiencies. In addition to presenting to the Central Party Department, the National Government, and the Executive Yuan, I would like to send a telegram first. Finance Minister Song Ziwen Kouxian (Special Dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<h3>Plan to Compensate for Likin Abolition</h3>

(Special Dispatch from the 15th) Central Party Headquarters</p>
<h3>Fundraising for Construction Expenses</h3>
<p>Donation Methods for Staff of Various Institutions Nanjing The cost of rebuilding the Central Party Headquarters is estimated at one million yuan. The address is located near the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Team leaders such as Lin Sen have been assigned to solicit donations separately.

The meeting adjourned at 6:00 pm. (Special Dispatch from the 15th) He Yingqin</p>
<h3>Speech on Military Reorganization</h3>
<p>Nanjing He Yingqin gave a speech at the memorial week of the Ministry of Military Affairs on the morning of the 15th, saying that military reorganization must be carried out before political training and construction. If military affairs cannot be reorganized, then everything else is out of the question. According to the statistics of this military reorganization committee, there are 66 divisions and several independent brigades that are directly funded by the central government. If the number of regiments is calculated according to the current number of regiments and salaries are paid according to the regulations, plus the expenses of military agencies, it will cost at least 30 million yuan per month. In addition, provinces such as Guangdong, Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Xinjiang, Gansu, and the Northeast are not included. If combined, the monthly cost will be more than 50 million yuan. Such a huge military expenditure is beyond the financial capacity of the country. If we do not seek to reorganize urgently, the danger is unimaginable. At this time, what we hope most is that the military can realize that they must understand politics and understand the situation of the country, so that they can abandon their own selfish interests and take care of the country's urgent needs.

The central government has approved it. There were rumors that Mo resigned to the central government due to physical weakness and that Gu Weijun would succeed him. Now, the person in charge of the diplomatic authorities stated that these rumors are completely untrue. (Special Dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<h3>The Question of Redeeming the Jiaoji Railway</h3>
<p>Nanjing The Shandong Provincial Government submitted a report to the Executive Yuan, stating that the Economic and Financial Reorganization Committee of the Provincial Government suggested that the central government should establish a preparatory committee for redeeming the Jiaoji Railway as soon as possible and formulate three measures: (1) After the redemption, the railway should be owned by the state or the province; (2) The preparatory committee for redeeming the railway should be established within the Economic and Financial Committee of the Shandong Provincial Government to investigate the operating conditions of the railway first; (3) Funds for redeeming the railway should be raised as soon as possible. The reason for redeeming the railway rights is that the Japanese government's management clause stipulated in the Shandong Case Agreement has expired in February of this year, and the Japanese government has no reason to object. The Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Railways on the 15th to review the redemption plan. (Special Dispatch from the 15th)</p>

(Special Dispatch from the 15th) Beiping Zhang Xueliang told someone that the troop issue was the most difficult to discuss in the post-war measures for Shanxi, but the principle of resolution is nothing more than fairness.

After Yan arrived in Tianjin, he telegraphed Wang Jingwei to inform him that he had arrived safely in Tianjin, and Wang replied from Hong Kong with great approval and hoped that he would travel to Fusang soon. Feng has not arrived in Tianjin, but he has left Shanxi Province. The authorities in Beiping and Tianjin are paying close attention to Feng's whereabouts, and scouts have been dispatched everywhere, but there is still no news. Now that the military affairs have ended and China is unified, with Commander Chiang in the south and Vice Commander Zhang in the north working together to implement the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, there is great hope for China's future.

<p>Reuters dispatch on the 15th from Madrid: The Spanish government issued a statement saying that the Jekai incident was the harbinger of a national general uprising, and anyone who follows the rebels will be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch on the 15th from Madrid: This morning, two military aircraft flew over the sky and dropped a salute to military personnel stating the Republican party has already risen up and that soldiers and civilians alike have come to its support. They warned that if there is any resistance, their barracks will be bombed immediately. Republicans here say that the authorities' execution of two military officers is a signal for a national uprising, and representatives of the new government have been selected in various places. Madrid is quiet as usual, but newspapers have stopped publishing and police patrols are frequent. The authorities regard the leaflets dropped by the planes as deliberate intimidation.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch on the 14th from Hendaye: It is expected that a general strike will occur throughout Spain, so the government is now planning to declare martial law. It is said that the former Minister of the Army, Chai Mora, who is now a leader of the moderate Republican Party, and Maura, the son of a well-known Conservative Party leader, have both been detained in Madrid.</p>
<p>National News Agency dispatch on the 15th from Paris: According to an unconfirmed report received from Hendaye, general strikes have occurred in some towns in northern Spain. These workers are fully equipped with self-provided firearms, ready to resist if the government uses force against them.</p>
<p>National News Agency dispatch on the 14th from Madrid: The general strike in Zaragoza has resumed after the military governor issued a decree to ban strikes and force shopkeepers to open their doors. However, the situation in Jekai is still chaotic. Although government troops have recaptured the city, the rebel army suffered minimal losses and is still entrenched in the nearby mountains, waiting for reinforcements from rebel troops elsewhere. However, official reports claim that the government is quite capable of controlling the situation.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch on the 14th from Hendaye: News from Madrid: The leaders of the Jekai rebellion in Spain, Galan and Salerna, were captured after their defeat and subjected to military law. They have now been executed. The remaining officers were sentenced to life imprisonment. Chalan was imprisoned for four years in 1926 for plotting a failed coup.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch on the 15th from Madrid: According to an official announcement, Colonel Galan and Captain Garcia, the leaders of the rebels, were both shot. Captain Salerna, Lieutenant Muni, and Lieutenant Kisbai were all sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch on the 15th from Paris: When the leader of the Jekai rebellion was executed, the executioners were selected from suspicious regiments and ordered to obey orders carefully. Both military officers died generously.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch on the 15th from Madrid: The government has published a long article describing the Jekai incident, stating that a group of officers and some soldiers and farmers suddenly revolted on December 12, falsely claiming that Spain had declared a republic. Loyal soldiers and gendarmes were dispatched to resist and killed three rebels. The rebels then formed a revolutionary committee, cut off transportation, seized military equipment and uniforms, and distributed them to supporting civilians, using cargo trucks to carry troops to Huesca. After dawn on the 13th, they encountered government troops ten miles from Huesca. Government troops had artillery and fired artillery at the rebels. The rebels abandoned two corpses, twenty-five injured people, and several rifles and machine guns and fled.</p>
<p>National News Agency dispatch on the 14th from Paris: The Spanish Ambassador, Li Ang, met with French Foreign Minister Briand today for a long time. It is reported that the main topic of discussion was the situation in northern Spain and along the border. Although Spanish troops and security forces are closely guarding the border, the Jekai rebels are still fleeing into French territory.</p>
<h3>Approaching the Japanese Political Season</h3>
<p>The Proletariat prepares to expose the current government's shortcomings - There is no legal problem with the Acting Prime Minister attending Parliament.</p>
<p>Japan United News Agency dispatch on the 15th from Tokyo: As the political season draws closer, the various factions of the Proletarian Party are gradually preparing for the Diet. Because various important cases are piling up in the Diet and there is a lot of material for attacking the government, a joint committee of the Proletarian Party will be established in the upcoming Diet to fight the Diet, propose motions, hold mass movements outside the Diet, and expose the current government's shortcomings by opposing the government's policies on issues such as military expansion, tax cuts, unemployment, labor unions, and the suppression of the Proletarian Party.</p>
<p>Denstu News Agency dispatch on the 15th from Tokyo: The government intends to have Prime Minister Kiyoura act as Prime Minister during this Diet session. Regarding whether there are any legal issues, Dr. Tatsukichi Minobe said that there are no legal questions regarding the relationship between the acting Prime Minister and the Diet. There have been precedents for the acting Prime Minister attending the Diet, so it is obviously not impossible. Also, having the acting Prime Minister go through the entire Diet session only prolongs the time, and there is no legal obstacle. However, whether it is acceptable in terms of political morality is another matter.</p>
<p>Denstu News Agency dispatch on the 15th from Tokyo: Regarding the government's plan for Prime Minister Kiyoura to attend this Diet session as acting Prime Minister, Dr. Minobe has stated that there is no legal violation. However, the opposition party, the Seiyukai, says that Prime Minister Hamaguchi's recovery, no matter how rapid, will definitely not allow him to attend the Diet, which is extremely clear. Even if he can get to the Diet, it is feared that it will be difficult to continue during the session. Now, having the Acting Prime Minister attend is absolutely not allowed under constitutional politics. Furthermore, Mr. Kiyoura is not a member of a political party, which is even more inappropriate. This is a reversal of constitutional government.</p>
<h3>Chile Raises Tariffs</h3>

<h3>United States Business Report for the Year</h3>
<p>Dull import and export trade.</p>
<p>Substantial progress in agriculture.</p>
<p>Associated Press dispatch on the 14th from Washington: According to the annual business report submitted to President Hoover today by US Secretary of Commerce Lamont, although the US economy has gone through a period of turmoil, there are still many reasons to be optimistic. Although the US business situation has been declining since November 1929, the national products and business activities during the statistical fiscal year (ending June 30, 1930) were excellent, especially the progress in agriculture, which was remarkable. The construction industry was also quite active, but not as prosperous as in previous years. Railway income was far less than before. The financial position of the United States has shifted due to mortgage loans, so the turmoil in the trading market in 1929 was the cause of the nationwide commercial decline, resulting in a reduction in US import taxes due to the weakness of domestic purchasing power, and the sluggishness of exports was also due to the decline in the purchasing power of other countries.</p>
<h3>Polish Minority Groups Meet</h3>
<p>Conspire to protect rights</p>
<p>National News Agency dispatch on the 14th from Warsaw: Representatives of minority groups from Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Lithuania, and Latvia held a special meeting in Riga and decided to establish a secretariat to communicate with Polish people in various countries to protect the rights granted by the Treaty of Versailles and the International League of Nations Charter. The headquarters will be located in Berlin. Indian Princely Representatives</p>
<h3>Refuting Churchill's Remarks</h3>
<p>Saying bureaucratic government and iron-fisted policies cannot make Indians willingly submit</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch on the 14th from London: Churchill, former Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Conservative government, expressed his views on the Indian issue in a speech on Thursday, saying that Britain does not want to give up the power to actually manage the lives and progress of Indians, and that the Round Table Conference has no right to enact a constitution, and any measures it determines cannot bind the British Parliament in spirit and law. British Prime Minister MacDonald issued a statement the next day refuting his remarks, accusing him of being rash and not contributing to construction, but rather adding to the burden. The Times also published an article criticizing Churchill's remarks, stating that representatives of the three major British parties are currently abandoning their party views and working day and night to resolve major issues with Indian representatives. Churchill should not have made these remarks that would provoke resentment among Indians at this time. However, Churchill cannot represent the Conservative Party and his remarks are insignificant. The Indian representative from Bikaner, who attended the Round Table Conference today, published an article stating that anyone with a little knowledge can say that India, which contains a majority of thoughtful people, can forever willingly submit to the rule of a bureaucratic government, or can iron-fisted policies be used to make them submit? Those who participated in the Indian Round Table Conference have now reached a conclusion that the great driving force for making India prosper should be included in the federal constitution that links British India and the princely states of India. However, some say that if this goal is achieved, India will be manipulated by a few ambitious people and fall into the chaos of China. I don't know that if there is such a bad result, the worst sufferers will be the Indian princes and people. The loss to the Indians is ten times greater than to the British. The people who are closely related to the Indians are Zhang Mu, who trap their country in chaos. Is this what should be in reason? What makes India leave is the attempt to include extraordinary national forces in an unsuitable non-national government. On the other hand, if you want to keep India under the crown, Britain only has to reject all doubts by its parliament. Britain should recognize the power of justice and use the courage and generosity that a great nation should have to guide the new India and steadily plan for the satisfaction of India in a national government within the federal system. This policy has been applied to Canada and South Phi and has been effective.</p>
<h3>Japanese Authorities Suppress Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo Press Expresses Indignation - Hamaguchi unable to see newspapers while sick</p>
<p>Denstu News Agency dispatch on the 15th from Tokyo: When the Hamaguchi Cabinet was formed, it strongly advocated freedom of speech. As time passed, it broke its previous promises and gradually suppressed speech. Administrative and judicial measures were used to prohibit publication or posting, and this happened from time to time. Representatives of the speech community urged the government to reflect, which was not uncommon, but the government's suppression intensified, especially of assemblies and speeches by the proletariat. The suppression was beyond words, and there were often unintentional actions and illegal arrests of journalists and correspondents in the hope of obtaining materials. Recently, Takashi Ogoshi, a reporter for the Jiji Shinpo, was illegally imprisoned, which became an issue in the speech community. The reporter corps in various official residences rose up to condemn the authorities and resolved to thoroughly censure them. At the same time, executives of various news agencies and news agencies in Tokyo negotiated and passed a joint declaration to censure the government's suppression of speech.</p>
<p>Denstu News Agency dispatch on the 15th from Tokyo: The government's suppression of speech has aroused resistance from the speech community in Tokyo, and the government is quite embarrassed. Maruyama, the Superintendent-General of the Metropolitan Police, visited Prime Minister Kiyoura at the Prime Minister's residence in Nagata-cho this morning to discuss countermeasures for the joint declaration on the suppression of speech by various newspapers and news agencies.</p>
<p>Denstu News Agency dispatch on the 15th from Tokyo: Prime Minister Hamaguchi, who is sick in bed, has recently requested to read newspapers every day. Shinabe, the attending physician, is holding back because the Minseito party is currently fighting over it, fearing that he will know about it, so he has been postponing it every day. The morning papers today have all attacked the government's suppression of speech, believing that giving the newspapers to read will stimulate his nerves and harm his health, so they will not be given to him for the time being.</p>

<h3>Central Party Headquarters and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held the 90th Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters at 9:00 AM on the 15th. Approximately 500 to 600 people including Central Committee members, heads of various departments and bureaus, staff members, and guests attended. Chairman Dai Jitao presided over the ceremony and reported that we are now at the end of the 19th year of the Republic of China and that the decision on the important work of the 20th year of the Republic of China should be noted with care. After the completion of the campaign against the rebels, the people in various places have voiced strong criticisms of the party departments at all levels. Chairman Chiang who returned from the front made an extremely grave report on this, and it is especially impacting the reputation and strength of the entire party. In fact, it can be divided into two kinds: (1) The upper-level party organization is unsound, and its work is doing revolutionary work. All the claims conflict with the ideas and customs of the general unenlightened people and corrupt scholars, etc. They cannot accept the root and wood, so they seized the shortcomings of the party members to carry out attacks. (1) The lower-level party department cannot be sound due to the lack of local self-government organizations (2) The central government's orders cannot be universally implemented. Regarding any construction of the country and local, the central government issues orders. The provincial governments can accept the orders, but when it is issued to the county, the efficiency has greatly reduced, and it is like a stone falling into the sea when the county issues it to the countryside. Therefore, the reform policy in the future is to actively carry out seven movements to promote local self-government, increase the strength of the party department, establish the foundation of construction, and the fundamental work is to remedy the lack of education and create the talents needed. Therefore, the most important thing in the central government's work plan for the 20th year of the Republic of China is to vigorously carry out educational construction. At the same time, in order to communicate the culture of the north and the south, special attention is paid to transportation construction. The construction plan includes (1) completing the Longhai and Yuehan roads and building the Dianyue road (2) implementing the Guiding Huai River (3) setting up a medical specialist school in each provincial capital or city with a population of more than 300,000, and attaching a hospital with a capacity of more than 200 people (4) Each province sets up a higher education institution and attaches a farm of more than 5,000 mu and a forest farm of more than 10,000 mu (5) Each former Taoist government sets up a secondary agricultural school and attaches a farm of more than 500 mu and a forest farm of more than 1,000 mu (6) Each provincial capital or city with a population of more than 300,000 sets up a higher industrial school, and its craftsmanship is based on nearby local products and needs, and there must be a corresponding workshop attached to it. The houses and all the material equipment are not rich, but only sufficient for application. No matter how difficult this educational construction is in various provinces, it must be prepared in the 20th year of the Republic of China, and it will be implemented and opened in the 21st year. Although the financial resources of the provinces are not abundant, if it is said that this cannot be done, then I do not believe it. If there is a lack of scientific talents, it is better to seek talents from other countries. The party departments at all levels must be rich in strength to urge and assist in carrying out this matter. If we can implement this, I believe that there will be considerable achievements in five years or years, and the strength of the country and society will also be greatly improved. The central government has a whole plan for reorganizing and reforming party affairs, which must be implemented next year. Comrades in the lower-level party departments should still promote their work while carrying out their duties and that there will be a new atmosphere after the new year. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Niu Yongjian Takes Office as Minister of Personnel</h3>

Chairman Wang Chonghui presided over the ceremony and first presented the seal. Chairman Wang Chonghui presented the seal, and Minister of Personnel Niu Yongjian received the seal, followed by the oath-taking ceremony. Central Committee member Dai Jitao supervised the oath, and Niu raised his right hand and swore an oath. After the oath, supervisor Dai Jitao delivered a speech stating, "Minister Niu has made great achievements in our party's revolution for many years and has long been respected by colleagues. The key to major political construction in the future lies in stipulating various palace rules and laws and being good at applying them. It is deeply believed that after Minister Niu takes office, he will be able to promote and benefit the implementation of various laws. Furthermore, Minister Niu is meticulous and will make great contributions to the completion of various systems in the future. It is hoped that after Minister Niu takes office, he will promote existing laws and regulations on the one hand and complete the systems that should be improved as soon as possible so that the government's foundation will become more consolidated." Next, Chairman Shi Chonghui delivered a speech stating, "Among the Five-Power Constitution of the Prime Minister, in addition to the original three powers of administration, judiciary, and legislation, the other two powers of examination and supervision were first created by the Prime Minister. Examination and supervision have an interrelationship. The biggest task of the Ministry of Personnel is to examine the qualifications of the civil service and examine their performance. If malpractices occur after employment, the Censorate will implement impeachment and punishment. It is deeply believed that after Minister Niu takes office, he will be able to "resolutely not misuse a single person in accordance with the civil service oath." Niu replied, "I am humble in my knowledge and shallow in my political experience. The responsibility of personnel affairs is of utmost importance, and I am deeply concerned about falling short. I did not dare to take office rashly, but since I have been appointed by the government, I will follow the Prime Minister's last wishes and the supervisor's and chairman's instructions to do my best to live up to the government's expectations and hope that my colleagues will give me guidance at all times." After the reply, the music was played, the ceremony was completed, and the participants dispersed.</p>

<h3>Request for Compensation for War Losses of Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>The provincial government decided to first order the counties along the line to investigate, and after the investigation is completed, consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for approval.</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: The provincial government suddenly received a letter from Nishita Kōichi, the Japanese consul in Jinan, a few days ago, stating that this year's war has affected Japanese women in Jinan, Shandong, and along the Jiaoji Railway line, who have repeatedly relocated to take refuge, incurring heavy expenses. A total of 77 households of Japanese residents in Zhangdian and Fangzi were damaged and looted, with a total loss of 27,473 yuan, requesting compensation. The provincial government submitted this for discussion at the 23rd political affairs meeting on the 12th. According to the secretariat's report, since the Shandong Negotiation Office has been abolished and local diplomacy is under the central government's jurisdiction, it should be transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for approval after ordering the counties along the route to investigate and submit a report. The result was a resolution to adopt the following report from the Secretariat of the Provincial Government on this case: "Approved letter from Nishita Kōichi, Consul-General of Japan in Jinan, stating that this year's war has affected Shandong, and this office and the Jiaoji Railway line have been engulfed in the whirlpool. Because of the two times of seizure in this office, the Japanese women living in Jinan have repeatedly moved. The Japanese women living in Zhoucun have been unable to take refuge. Fortunately, no misfortune has occurred in Zhoucun Zhangdian and other places. Since the war has affected the line from Zhoucun to Fangzi, the residences of Japanese nationals are in danger. At that time, the situation was so confusing that it was impossible to do anything about it. At that time, the security situation was very lax, and many houses were damaged and looted because the Japanese nationals left. There are 55 households in Fangzi and</p>
<p>23 households in Zhangdian, totaling 77 households. The directors in Fangzi and Zhangdian have jointly investigated with the local authorities and reported to the relevant county heads. The current situation is stable, and Japanese nationals are gradually returning. The victims have repeatedly reported the direct losses they have suffered, and the directors of the branch offices have carried out serious investigations, and the damages that are difficult to admit have been generally deleted. The total damage suffered by Japanese nationals along the line is 27,473 yuan and 8 jiao 1 fen. The compensation now requested includes direct damage losses and the cost of refuge, and is actually only the damage to the housing, furniture, and loot. The investigation report and the general situation of the damage are hereby submitted together. I hope for compensation and please indicate the method of resolution as soon as possible, etc. Subsequently, the second section of this office reported that according to the order No. 2361 issued by the Executive Yuan on August 3 of the 18th year, after the abolition of the Shandong Negotiation Office, all diplomacy in various places shall be under the jurisdiction of the central government. Since this case is a diplomatic case, it seems that it should be handled in accordance with the previous order. It is proposed that after ordering the counties along the route to investigate and submit a report, it should be transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for approval. Is it appropriate to request a review and follow the instructions, etc., and how should it be handled? Please make a public decision."</p>
<h3>Preparation for Abolishing the Likin Tax in Shandong</h3>
<p>The Department of Finance Formulates Methods for Compensation and Implementation Procedures</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Department of Finance, in compliance with the Ministry of Finance's order to abolish the Likin tax by January 1st of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], a deadline that is rapidly approaching, and fearing that the province's budget for the 19th year [1930] cannot be maintained after the abolition of the Likin tax, has specifically formulated compensation methods and implementation procedures, which were submitted to the provincial government for discussion and implementation. They have been presented at the 22nd provincial government meeting and a Shandong Likin Abolition Committee has been organized to prepare everything. The memorial of the Department of Finance is recorded as follows: "In accordance with the order of the Ministry of Finance, the abolition of the Likin tax is to be completed by January 1st of the 20th year, and preparations should be actively made for methods to compensate after the abolition, and a plan should be formulated, etc. Upon investigation, Shandong is not an area rich in products. Based on the resolution of the National Likin Abolition Committee, of the 21 categories of special taxes, only ten are suitable for implementation in this province: textiles, factory output, minerals, silk, soybeans, cotton, peanuts, and dried fruit and fur. Except for the first two, textiles and factory output, which are directly managed by the Ministry, and the minerals item, which is already subject to a special tax, only seven remain: silk, cotton, soybeans, etc. Although the special tax rate is higher than the current donation rate, bureaus can only be established to collect taxes at the place of production or gathering of goods, and no card can be set up at each stage. All scattered goods must be abandoned. In the future, if foreign imported goods of the same kind as the special tax have already paid customs duties, and then need to pay special tax, the income may increase slightly; otherwise, only taxing the province's products is expected to generate no more than half of the local goods donation revenue per year. Since the 14th year of the Republic [1925], when Zhang Zongchang was the governor of Shandong, the province's commerce has suffered from excessive levies and exploitation. Since then, disasters have occurred repeatedly, and its vitality has not recovered. If a provincial business tax is implemented based on business income, it is feared that it will not be very smooth. The revenue budget for Shandong Province in the 19th year has already included the existing donations and taxes, with the local goods donation being 4.6 million yuan and the Jiaoji Railway goods donation being 800,000 yuan, totaling 5.4 million yuan. Once abolished, local revenue will be insufficient to cover expenses, which is a serious concern. In order to comply with the central government's Likin abolition plan and maintain local revenue, the director of the department proposes that the provincial government should first consult the Ministry of Finance to have the Department of Finance mainly manage all items that should be subject to special taxes, in addition to the currently implemented special taxes on wheat flour, coal, and smoked tobacco. The tax revenue collected will be temporarily retained by the province for local use to supplement funds. Once the business tax is successfully implemented, it will be returned to the central government. On one hand, according to the organization of the provincial sub-committees determined by the National Likin Abolition Committee, a large assembly will be established to establish the Shandong Likin Abolition Committee, consisting of the Director of the Department of Finance, the Director of the Department of Agriculture and Mining, the Director of the Finance Bureau of Jinan City, representatives of the General Chamber of Commerce, and those hired by the provincial government who have rich financial and economic knowledge or experience. An Economic and Financial Reorganization Committee can also be appointed to send representatives as members to specialize in researching the abolition of Likin and compensation methods. Several shares are set up below to be responsible for general affairs, investigation, and compilation matters in order to gather ideas and benefit from each other to plan for progress, so that both laws and facts are considered. Whether the compensation method and implementation procedures drafted by the Department of Finance are appropriate should be presented for review and guidance."</p>
<h3>Ancient Artifacts from the Tan Kingdom Transported to Jinan for Research</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Institute of History and Philology of Academia Sinica and the Shandong Provincial Government jointly formed an antiquities research association to excavate the old city of the Tan Kingdom in Donglongshan Town, Jinan. Due to the cold weather, the excavation work has been suspended and the artifacts found have been transported to the College of Engineering of Qingdao University in Jinan for storage. The members of the association have also returned with satisfaction. Today, I visited Mr. Li Ji, director of the Archaeological Group of the Institute of History and Philology of Academia Sinica and director of the Longshan Office, to inquire about the work. According to him, from October 6th, when they arrived at Longshan, until November 12th, when they left Longshan, they worked for a total of 35 days. Excluding two days of rest, they actually worked for 33 days. They excavated a total of 43 pits, covering an area of 430 square meters and a volume of 1,411 cubic meters. They obtained a total of 89 boxes of artifacts, including more than ten pieces of pottery, 21,136 pieces of pottery shards, 327 stone tools, 1,693 pieces of bone tools and bones (including 18 human skeletons), 915 pieces of shell tools and shells, 60 pieces of horns, and other jade objects, one bronze arrowhead, three knife coins, and twelve oracle bones. The results of this work, generally speaking, show that the upper cultural layer is the Tan Kingdom culture, and the artifacts obtained include divination tools, bronze ware, and pottery. Among the pottery, dou vessels [a type of stemmed bowl] are the most numerous. The lower cultural layer is the culture before the Tan Kingdom, and the artifacts obtained include stone tools, black pottery, and red pottery. By comparison, the pottery from before the Tan Kingdom is the most exquisite, with unique and beautiful styles never seen before. Although the pottery from the contemporary Tan Kingdom is more recent, its shape is inferior. It is speculated that by the Spring and Autumn period of the Tan Kingdom, bronze ware was commonly used, and pottery mostly imitated the styles of bronze ware, such as ding tripods and yi vessels, but the craftsmanship was less advanced than before. Furthermore, compared with the ancient pottery excavated in Anyang (Yinxu) and Yangshao (Mianchi) in previous years, the pottery from Tan City is thinner, and the patterns seem to be less than those from Yinxu and other places, perhaps due to different customs. In addition, the bones obtained in Yinxu and other places are mostly pig bones, while the bones obtained in Tan City are mostly cattle bones, which is also worth studying. What is most noteworthy is that the current ground surface of Longshan is the old Tan Kingdom city. The Tan Kingdom city is more than one meter deep and empty. Below that is a layer of yellow sand about two centimeters thick. Below the yellow sand layer is the oldest stratum where black pottery was found. It is speculated that this yellow sand layer may be the remnant of a flood that occurred there before the establishment of the Tan Kingdom, but the date cannot be determined. The artifacts obtained have now been transported to Jinan. Except for those that cannot be studied in Jinan and will be transported to Beiping, the rest will be stored entirely in Jinan and will not be transported elsewhere (those transported to Beiping will also be transported back after research). Our work for more than a month has been just trying to make a living in piles of broken tiles and bricks. It is not worth laughing at those who say that large amounts of treasures have been excavated. The excavation work has ended and a meeting is scheduled to be held in Jinan on the 14th to report on the process and discuss research methods. Furthermore, during the excavation, two human skeletons were found under the city wall of the Tan Kingdom, one headless and limbless, and the other intact, lying face down with both hands covering the face, with a bronze arrowhead under the body. Some say that they were the victims when Duke Huan of Qi destroyed Tan, but whether this is the case cannot be determined at this time. It is undeniable that they died in battle. (13th)</p>
<h3>Passenger Train on the Sidao Railway Robbed</h3>
<p>Taonan Correspondence: On the afternoon of the 9th of this month, at about 5 o'clock, the second train on the Sidao Railway, traveling from Taonan to Siping Street, was suddenly attacked near the Shanzuizi Road House, west of Chuanjiatun Station, by about sixty or seventy mounted bandits who had previously tied up the workers at the road house, cut the communication lines, and dismantled a section of the railway track, and posted sentries everywhere. The total number of bandits was estimated to be no less than one hundred, all carrying guns and cannons. When the train arrived at the scene, the bandits immediately opened fire on the train. The police escorting the train also opened fire and fought bravely, but the railway track had been destroyed and three carriages immediately derailed and overturned. The train police escorting the train numbered only eight people and were eventually outnumbered, resulting in many injuries, including one who was seriously injured and in critical condition. Several passengers were also injured. All the railway funds of several thousand yuan and passenger luggage were robbed. Upon hearing the news, the railway bureau immediately dispatched the chief of the traffic section, the chief of the business section, and the chief of the police section, along with forty armed railway police officers, to immediately drive a rescue train to the scene for rescue and to pursue the fleeing bandits. At the same time, urgent telegrams were sent to military and police agencies along the line to quickly send teams to encircle and suppress the bandits. At 11 o'clock at night, the rescue train returned to Siping Street and immediately sent the injured passengers and police to various hospitals of the railway and the South Manchuria Railway for proper treatment. Poor passengers whose funds were robbed were provided with funds by the railway bureau to be sent to their destinations. In addition to reporting to the Commander-in-Chief's Office and the Northeast Communications Committee, efforts are being made to handle the aftermath urgently and repair the damaged railway line overnight, with the expectation of restoring traffic on the evening of the 10th.

<h3>Shanxi After Yan's Departure</h3>
<p>Provincial Government Holds Important Meetings</p>
<p>City Life Gradually Returns to Normal</p>
<p>Important Figures of the Yan Faction Resign One After Another</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since Yan's departure from Shanxi, the situation here has taken a turn for the better, and the state of panic caused by the planes dropping bombs on Taiyuan has completely disappeared, and all industries have gradually returned to normal. The most recent news is summarized below. Shang Zhen and Xu Yongchang believe that all issues since Yan's departure from Shanxi must be resolved after careful handling, but the daily supply of provisions to the troops and the maintenance of Shanxi currency are closely related to the public and must be resolved as a priority to alleviate the people's difficulties. Yesterday, a special meeting was convened at the provincial government with important figures, generals stationed in Taiyuan, and representatives from the units of Sun Dianying, Gao Guizi, and Yue Xiangru to discuss solutions. Everyone at the meeting recognized that these two issues were extremely important and could not be resolved locally, and it was decided to send a telegram to the central government for instructions. After the meeting, Shang Zhen immediately telegraphed the central government for instructions. As for the allocation of military pay, the division of defense zones, and other issues, they will be discussed with Zhang Xueliang. Since the central government's planes bombed Taiyuan five times in succession, the panic suffered by the people here was as great as frightened birds, and everyone was in a state of anxiety. Various agencies changed their office hours, shops opened only half-doors, and most students in schools had returned home, so classes were suspended de facto. People continued to dig cellars. Now that Yan has left Shanxi, and the central government has telegraphed that planes will no longer come to Taiyuan, the provincial government yesterday notified the Department of Education to instruct schools under its jurisdiction to quickly find ways to summon students who had returned home to return to school, and ordered all agencies to resume their old office hours from today (the 4th), and ordered the General Chamber of Commerce to instruct all shops to completely resume normal business hours. It has been found that two-thirds of the shops are fully open for business today. Ji Gongquan, the president of the Shanxi High Court, had repeatedly petitioned the provincial government to resign when the rumors of Yan's departure from Shanxi were very strong. Shang Zhen has already approved it and appointed Wang Zhaopeng, the chief justice of the Supreme Branch Court, as his successor. Wang has already taken office. Xu Yiqing, the president of the National Bank, the president of the Shanxi Provincial Bank, the member of the Shanxi Financial Public Debt Fund Custody Committee, and the director of the Shanxi Provincial Business Association and the Xixin Society, has also resigned from the above positions since Yan's departure from Shanxi. It is said that Xu has left Shanxi and gone to Tianjin to prepare to accompany Yan abroad. In addition, there are said to be several other department heads who are preparing to resign.

<h3>Trends in the Sino-Soviet Eastern Railway Telecommunications Rights Conference</h3>
<p>The Russian Side Moves the Telephone Section to Moscow</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Intends to Interfere with the Sino-Japanese Eastern Railway Contract</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Sino-Soviet Eastern Railway Telecommunications Rights Conference has been held intermittently, neither breaking off nor making progress. Since the establishment of the special committee on May 1st of this year, the so-called formal meeting has not yet been held after eight months, and the Sino-Soviet special committee meetings have been held twenty-two times before and after, and only the news service items have been discussed. The telephone section problem has been rumored for two months, but has not been discussed. Recently, Li Deyan, the representative of the Communications Committee, met with Russian Committee Chairman Janison to discuss the procedures for this section of the meeting, and learned that the Russian side, without obtaining our consent, had sent all the telephone files to Moscow to be raised at the Sino-Soviet Conference. This is completely contrary to the original purpose of the meeting. Li Deyan reported this to the Communications Committee, and the Communications Committee, in addition to ordering Li to declare to the Soviet side of the Eastern Railway that the issue should still be resolved by the Sino-Soviet Telecommunications Rights Conference convened in Harbin, telegraphed Mo Dehui to instruct the Russian side to refuse to discuss the issue when it is raised, so that the whole case can be returned to Harbin. Due to this twist in the telephone section problem, the expected start of discussions in the latter half of this month will not take place. As for the progress of the public telegraph issue conference, it is also extremely slow. Currently, the special committee still holds three meetings per week as usual, but only to sort out previous records, and the unresolved items may need to be re-examined. The Russian side is deliberately delaying the resolution of this issue, and also claims that the original records are incorrect and wants to raise other opinions and request them to be attached. The Chinese side believes that the records have been signed by both parties' committee members, although they have not been used as draft agreements, but all negotiations can only be based on the original records and should not raise other opinions, otherwise the records will be invalid and the addition of opinions will be endless and the deadline of the meeting will be unreachable. Therefore, the Russian side's request was rejected, but the Russian side said that they have the right to raise it, and the Chinese side denies that it is another issue. Therefore, the task of sorting out the records has been going on for many days and has not yet been completed, and the public telegraph issue has not been resolved. Regarding the private telegraph contract secretly concluded between the Eastern Railway and the Manchuria Railway, the Eastern Railway recently realized that it was illegal, so it did not insist on canceling the original contract. However, the Manchuria Railway finds it very convenient to rent the Eastern Railway's telegraph lines, and is unwilling to cancel it. Recently, it requested that when the Sino-Russian negotiations on this section are held, the Manchuria Railway should be allowed to send personnel to participate in the discussions, which was rejected by Li Deyan. However, it is said that this matter will be discussed by another committee to be organized next week, and if the Manchuria Railway is not allowed to send personnel to join, it will inevitably interfere.

<p>A Woman from Suzhou Raped and Sold: Chen Wangshi, a widow from Suzhou, is not unattractive. Her brother works as a laborer in Shanghai. She took a train from Suzhou to Shanghai a few days ago to work in a factory, but when the train reached near Nanxiang, the engine broke down and all the passengers got off. Mrs. Chen was lured to a rural temple by several unknown men claiming to take her to Shanghai, where she was forcibly raped for seven consecutive days. Later, she was led to the 11th district by Zhang Along (from Jiwang Temple) and sold to the brother of a villager, Cheng Youliang, as his wife for 150 yuan. Mrs. Chen took the opportunity to escape to the 1st branch office of the local Public Security Bureau to report the incident.

<p>Guo Daming's Divorce Case Appeal: Former Feng Army Commander Guo Songling's younger brother, Guo Daming, married Ms. Jiang Ruiying in November of the ninth year of the Republic of China through a matchmaker. They were married at the Yongchunlou Restaurant in Heilongjiang. Initially, the couple's relationship was very close, but in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, Guo Daming met a prostitute named Ju Di in Hanjiatan, Beijing. He immediately redeemed her and took her as a concubine, renaming her Chen Huiying. After Guo Songling's rebellion failed, Chen Huiying betrayed Guo and went to Shanghai to resume her career as a courtesan, using the name Lin Guiqing. From the 14th to 17th years of the Republic of China, Guo Daming went to Shanghai and recognized Chen Huiying at the Yipinxian Restaurant. Chen, at that time, sought to return to the old ways by having Guo's property returned and resuming cohabitation. They are currently residing at No. 114 Yangyu Lane in Suzhou. Soon, Jiang Ruiying found out and went south, currently residing in Shanghai, at Jisi Feier Road, inviting Guo for negotiations. On September 6th of last year in Shanghai, Guo falsely requested to establish a fake divorce agreement with Jiang Ruiying in order to smoothly separate from Chen, and he also wrote proof that the divorce agreement was feigned. Jiang Ruiying, seeing that Guo had the intention of separating from Chen Huiying, agreed to establish a divorce agreement with him. Up until this spring, Guo and Chen had not separated and were still cohabitating, so she repeatedly negotiated with Guo, but Guo did not agree. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit with the Wuxian District Court, requesting a judgment to divorce Guo from Chen Huiying. Guo also hired a lawyer to defend him, saying that he had already separated from Jiang Ruiying and had a divorce agreement as proof. The court ruled to cancel the divorce document and confirmed that the plaintiff was the defendant's wife. Guo Daming refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyers Xu Shihao and Dai Jinghuai to appeal to the High Court. After repeated summons, the case could not be concluded. Yesterday (the 15th) at 2:00 PM, Judge Shen Yuan, the presiding judge of the First Civil Division of the High Court, again summoned both parties to court for trial. Guo Daming and lawyers Dai and Xu did not report to the court. Only Jiang Ruiying, accompanied by her defense lawyers Ni Gang and Jiang Shiyi, reported to the court. After the court opened, Judge Shen, noting that the appellant had not arrived, advised Jiang Ruiying and her lawyers to reconcile with Guo Daming. If reconciliation was not possible, the court would make a judgment. Jiang Ruiying stated that she originally did not want to divorce Guo. If she wanted to divorce, she would have done so in the first instance. Moreover, in the first instance, Guo was willing to pay 50,000 yuan in alimony. Now, if Guo Daming truly could not reconcile, she would need the court to make a fair judgment. The judge then instructed them to go out and try to reconcile. If it was not possible, the hearing would be rescheduled for around January 10th.</p>

Feng Jinrong has already been taken to the county for interrogation, while Ding Asheng suddenly died in the water patrol team's headquarters a few days ago. According to Captain Qian, Ding committed suicide out of fear of punishment. Liang, a trial officer from the county committee, and Shen, a coroner, went to examine the body. Coroner Shen issued an autopsy report stating that Ding Asheng's death was caused by strangulation with an iron chain, with iron chain marks on his neck and an abrasion on his right waist. However, after hearing the news, Ding Asheng's mother, Ding Sunshi, and wife, Ding Xushi, suspected that Ding's cause of death was unclear and immediately came to the city to investigate the truth. Yesterday, they submitted a petition to the county government requesting a re-examination to clear their grievances. In their petition, they accused the police of falsely accusing innocent people, detaining them without handing them over to the county, extorting confessions through illegal means, executing them with private punishments, and causing them to die unjustly. They requested a re-examination to allow relatives of the deceased to point out the truth and clarify the situation, and also requested that Captain Qian Tianxiong and Patrol Officer Zhu Jinru of the water patrol team be dismissed, placed under supervision, and strictly investigated. It is unknown how Magistrate Pan will handle this matter.</p>

<p>Crackdown on Opium Trafficking Operation in Sitou Town: Lei Jiaju, the chief of the Sixth Public Security Branch of Sitou Town, Fifth District (Tianshang City), recently received information from opium addict Wu Yongxi that he had been purchasing opium from Yang Gusheng's house. It was also discovered that Yang Gusheng engaged in both silkworm cocoon trading and opium trafficking, earning substantial profits. However, his house was deeply hidden and had seven or eight layers of doors, making it impossible for outsiders to know about it. Police officers were dispatched to arrest Yang's wife, Zhuang, and his younger brother, Yang Xiaoyun, and seized several pieces of evidence. They were immediately taken to the bureau for interrogation. Zhuang confessed that she was twenty-five years old and that although her husband, Gusheng, used to traffic opium, they had stopped selling it a long time ago. The opium pipes were left behind by her father-in-law. Yang Xiaoyun confessed that he worked in a stone powder factory in Huzhou and had only returned to Wuxi for three days. He had separated from Gusheng a long time ago and was unaware of his opium trafficking activities. The next day, Yang Gusheng himself was arrested. The town chief then bailed out Zhuang and Xiaoyun.

Zhu immediately sent personnel to Yangshuyuan to report to Inspector Li of the Winter Defense Bureau. Upon receiving the report, Inspector Li dispatched a team of soldiers to suppress them.

<p>The Water Company is Seeking Development: The Zhenjiang Water Company has been operating for six years, and all sectors inside and outside the city have praised its convenience. However, the company's capital is only 100,000 yuan, and it is said to owe 170,000 yuan. Monthly income is only over 7,000 yuan, while expenses are around 5,000 yuan. The water price is lower than other cities, which limits development due to debt. A meeting was held yesterday afternoon to discuss solutions. It is said that the company plans to encourage public-spirited people to join the share capital. The board of directors and supervisors will recruit, among the eighteen people, excluding the deceased Hu Ziming and Jin, who is living in Shanghai, and the sixteen people are planning to add 1,000 yuan each. Others are recruited from all sectors. Someone suggested that the major landlords who own a large amount of real estate in Zhenjiang should naturally join the share capital, because the Water Company is of great benefit to the major landlords. Taking insurance as an example, it used to cost twelve taels per thousand taels, but now it only costs six taels, which is a clear benefit. Other users can also join the shares according to their ability.</p>

<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Dredging Workers Brawled Over a Minor Matter: Recently, several dozen workers have been newly assigned to the dredging project in Zhapu, bringing the total to over a hundred.

<h3>Shengshan Town Was Looted by Bandits: Shengshan Town, about eighteen miles east of the city gate, has several villages, mostly inhabited by people with the surname Lu. There are about twenty stores of various sizes. A certain Lu in the town, who owns considerable assets, had long been coveted by bandits. Because the town is located in Zhitang, east of Chenshe Town, west of BaliDian, and adjacent to Yishan Village, the bandits did not dare to take it lightly. Unexpectedly, at about 1:00 AM on the 12th, two bandit ships carrying twenty or more bandits speaking in mixed dialects, armed with various firearms, knives, and clubs, suddenly arrived at the town. They first went to Lu's house and knocked on the door. Because the house's door and walls were strong and could not be broken, the bandits split up and looted various shops and residences. It is estimated that more than ten stores, including Xuyuan Chang Nanhuo Store, and Chen Yuansheng's boat, a tax collector from the Wuxing County government who was resting there, were robbed. It is said that the loss of each family is estimated to be more than 6,000 yuan.</h3>

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Orders Unqualified Private Schools to Close by the End of the Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday ordered private school teachers in the city to voluntarily close down by the end of this year, otherwise, strict measures will be taken.

Later, private school teachers, including Wang Shixian, jointly submitted a request to postpone the closure until the Dragon Boat Festival.

<p>Zhenru Wins St. John's (First Group)</p>
<p>The last group, Zhenru vs. St. John's, was very intense, and the scores were always close and difficult to distinguish. St. John's took the lead after the start, but Zhenru was not to be outdone and reached a tie of 8 to 8. But later, St. John's was very successful, and Chen Xianglong repeatedly made contributions, with the score leading at 14 to 10. Afterwards, Zhenru made great efforts to counterattack, and the score was reversed, with Zhenru winning the first half 22 to 18. In the second half, St. John's continued to work hard, and the score was often in the lead, but Zhenru followed closely behind and did not relax a bit. The score was only two or three points apart. In the last few minutes, Zhenru suddenly showed its power and jumped ahead, winning 37 to 32.</p>

<h3>End of the Shanghai Women's Basketball Tournament</h3>
<p>丨The First Team of Liangjiang is the Best丨</p>
<p>丨But There are Still Problems with the Championship丨</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Basketball Association concluded its championship last night. As usual, the championship goes to the First Team of Liangjiang, but because Liangjiang players Xi Jun were previously disqualified from participating in the Shanghai Municipal Games for violating amateur qualifications, a certain team has protested based on the above example. The basketball committee originally scheduled a meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday to discuss the matter, but the number of attendees was insufficient, so the matter could not be resolved. Therefore, although the game has ended, it is still pending who will win the championship and must be decided by the committee in the coming days. The results of the three groups last night: (1) Zhenru Wins Shanghai Middle School 16 to 13 (2) Liangjiang First Team Wins Jingwu 55 to 8 (3) Yaguang Wins Liangjiang Second Team 19 to 8. Also, during the game between Yaguang and Liangjiang Second Team last night, the cheering of Yaguang students was insulting to the other party, which is not the attitude that cheerleaders should have, nor the spirit that those who study sports should have. The results of each group and the scoring rate of each team are listed below:</p>

<h3>News from the Good Food Movement Gathering by Pu Gong</h3>
<p>Mr. Li Shizeng and Mr. Wu Zhihui, members of the Central Committee, are known for their frugality. Feeling that social gatherings are wasteful and banquets are unsanitary, they initiated a Good Food Association. The purpose is roughly that the function of social banquets is mostly to connect feelings. The reason why people are unwilling to save money is simply that they think it is not respectful enough if it is not rich. However, every banquet of ours costs dozens of gold, with dozens of dishes, lasting two or three hours. As a result, people often suffer from gastrointestinal diseases due to excessive amounts of greasy food. Therefore, whether eating is good or bad is not only related to individual economic hygiene, but also to the prosperity and strength of the country. Yesterday, the association held its first gathering at the Capital Education Fund Committee, and I also joined. Now I will write down some trivial things that are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>On this day, in addition to Mr. Li himself, there were Wu Zhihui, Wei Daoming, Li Shuhua, Chen Hexian, Vice Minister Xiao and Director Xu from the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, directors of various bureaus of the municipal government, and art experts, a total of more than twenty people gathered together, which was quite a grand occasion for a while.</p>
<p>At the meeting, Mr. Li Shizeng of the Central Committee said that the so-called good food is based on the good of truth, beauty, and goodness. If the dishes are too simple, the time of the gathering will be reduced, and the business will also be affected. Now, we want to improve meaningless banquets, save money, be hygienic, and take care of business, so that everyone can be good. Therefore, we call it good.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhihui of the Central Committee often made humorous remarks at grand events. At the meeting, he discussed the method of banqueting and eating, saying that when inviting guests, the host often cannot take care of everyone if there are two tables. Using casserole dishes on the table is also not elegant. It is best to sit together and divide the food, but there is no need to use knives and forks to imitate foreign methods, which is convenient.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes about Chairman Chiang's Glorious Return to His Hometown by Anan</h3>
<p>Last month, Chairman Chiang triumphantly returned to his hometown of Xikou. The elders and children celebrated Chairman's birthday and hired a local grass-roots opera troupe named Song Xiangji from Dalian to perform. (Famous actors in Shanghai in the past, such as Lü Yueqiao and Chang Chunheng, all came from this troupe.) Chairman and Madam Soong Mei-ling watched the opera for a long time and gave each actor two longevity peaches. (People in Ningbo call steamed buns longevity peaches.)</p>
<p>One day, Chairman Chiang and Chen Bulei were touring Wuling Elementary School when they saw a monk sleeping soundly. When asked who he was, Chen said that he was Abbot Anxin, the director of the Buddhist Orphanage of the White Clothes Temple in the North Gate of Ningbo. At that time, the monk also woke up, put his palms together, and said to Chiang, "Amitabha," "Amitabha," and then solicited donations for the orphanage from the chairman. Chiang gave him 500 gold.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang instructed the students of Wuling Elementary School that when he was young, he often obeyed his mother's orders to dig taro and sweet potatoes in the fields, saying that self-reliance must be based on diligence in childhood.</p>
<p>The inscription on the stele for Chairman Chiang's mother's tomb was written by Premier Sun.</p>
<p>Mr. Li said that when he was in Beiping, he once placed a square table in the middle of two round tables when entertaining guests. The host sat in the middle, like a pair of glasses, so that he could take care of both sides. Everyone who heard this praised the old man's new invention.</p>
<p>On that day, Mr. Zhong Ling arrived at the meeting and brought his newly invented printing machine for on-site testing. It was simple, clear, and could produce various primary colors. Everyone who saw it was amazed. Therefore, everyone present jointly signed a paper with a famous painter, Xu Beihong, who painted a plum blossom branch. The machine was used to print it, and it was bright and colorful. Each person was given a paper as a souvenir. (Returned Reward)</p>
<h3>Fun Facts about the Fire at Shengping Tower by Sun Choucheng</h3>
<p>Shengping Tower on Fourth Avenue caught fire at 7:45 PM on the 12th of this month. I was drinking with a friend at the Wei Ya Restaurant and heard and saw more details, so I chose some trivial things to share with readers.</p>
<p>Startled Mandarin Ducks: Shengping Tower is an area where courtesans gather. It was the time when tea customers were entering at night, and the courtesans were chatting intimately with the guests, inviting them to their boudoirs. Suddenly, smoke filled the room, and everyone knew that the fire was coming. They all scrambled to go downstairs. After this shock, they separated and flew away, making it difficult to do good things.</p>
<p>Bad Luck for Restaurants: The Wei Ya and Tongxing restaurants near the tower were newly built and reopened, hoping to make money. Around 8:00 PM, just as diners were arriving, the traffic was cut off due to the fire across the street. Not only did temporary diners dare not come, but even regular customers could not get in, resulting in a loss of money for the banquets that had been set up. Everyone called it bad luck.</p>
<p>The Courtesans Took Advantage: On that day, more than a dozen courtesans had already been invited to the Wei Ya Restaurant by the diners who arrived earlier. When they heard that there was a fire across the street, they were all extremely frightened and wanted to return home, but the entrance was blocked by the police, and the road was being watered, so they couldn't go anywhere. They could only sit next to the guests. After the fire was extinguished, they left. It took about an hour, which is much longer than the usual courtesan appointment, which only lasts a few minutes. I said that it is not easy to watch the fire from across the river and drink with the courtesans.</p>
<p>Lost His Footing and Regretted: The north wind was very strong that night, and the fire was very fierce. The fire trucks were lined up in the Xihuaifang alley area, desperately watering the road, and the water accumulated like a river. Because the ditches on the sidewalks were being rebuilt, a lot of mud had been dug up and piled up in front of the Tongxing Restaurant, forming a mound five or six feet high. The idlers were all occupying this mound to look into the distance. After 8:00 PM, the firefighters ordered the police to drive them away because they were hindering the work, resulting in someone losing his footing, wading in the water, losing his hat and shoes, and regretting it.</p>
<p>The Beauty Was Stained: The Xu Shengji Photographic Print Distributor, which opened at No. 152 downstairs in Shengping Tower, arranged various beauty calendar posters in mirror frames and hung them on the wall as advertisements. During the fire that night, the company was afraid of being affected and sent people to sort out the goods in the store in one place to find a way in case of emergency. However, the various beauty photos were hanging high on the wall and could not be cleaned up, resulting in them being stained by the fire trucks watering the area.</p>
<p>Exhibition of Trolleys: The fire lasted for about an hour that night, so the intersection of Fourth Avenue and Shilu Road was cut off. Other vehicles could still take detours, but the No. 17 trolley to Shilu Road and the No. 14 trolley to Fourth Avenue were</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Southeast Asia (101)</h3>
<p>If the Chinese want to do small businesses, there are ways to consider. The so-called "Guijia Treasure" in the former Ming Dynasty is the place where silver mines were operated. It is also an old Chinese mining area. It can still be operated on a small scale with a semi-mining method in cooperation with local chieftains. The name can be borrowed from the local chieftains, and it is not easy for the British to stop it. However, transportation is a problem. However, if the government is determined to send professional knowledgeable people to investigate and discuss solutions, there is no need to worry about not finding a way. Since I am only passing through as a traveler and am not a mining professional, I can only talk about it in general terms. If anyone has the intention to select and employ, this silver mine is a major issue on the Yunnan border and must be paid attention to.</p>
<p>On the 12th, the local newspaper reported that the British had employed the Governor of Burma for a four-month trial period. This is unprecedented, but knowledgeable Burmese people also know that Burmese people already have the right to self-government and hold high office. A Chinese friend told me that the British could not succeed in India, so they are trying their best to manage Burma because India is a large country with a large population and a high culture. Now that it has broken down, it is difficult to determine for a while. In case there are changes in the future, the British can still use Burma as a center to operate the Yunnan and Tibetan borders, which shows that their ambition to control the world's naval power is all-important. Generally speaking, there are many people on the Yunnan-Burma border who are very enthusiastic about border affairs and are very knowledgeable. If someone specializes in investigating border affairs and asks in detail, a lot of materials can be obtained. The place of the Southern Crossing is undulating, with no high mountains or ridges, but a plateau. The green fields are connected to the sky and stretch endlessly, with a large river in front and an iron bridge running through it. It is a very rich area, but it is a working-class society where gambling and food are the same day and night, which is truly irreparable. As for the silver companies, due to the impact of low silver prices, they have also reduced the number of workers and reduced everything, showing a tendency to retreat. The road is clumsy and inconvenient to detour, resulting in a standstill on the road. There are more than ten vehicles connected like trains, which is like opening a trolley exhibition.</p>
<h3>Further Study of the "Yu Tang Chun" Opera Lyrics by Shaoqing</h3>
<p>Tianxu Wosheng, a literary veteran, has furthered his study of my "Yu Tang Chun" opera lyrics, and I am delighted to hear this rare voice of appreciation. Refining the pronunciation is my pleasure. I will elaborate further without hesitation. Ancient and modern pronunciations differ, as do the rhymes in poetry and opera. The thirteen rhyme categories used in opera and Peking opera are also different. Times change, and regional differences exist, leading to vast differences in adoption. This is well known to those who study phonology. Among the thirteen rhyme categories of Peking opera, the "Dong" (東) category is unique because it uses nasalized and rounded sounds. The "Ren Chen" (人臣) category includes sounds that touch the palate. The true "Zhen Wen" (眞文), "Geng Ting" (庚亭) (read lightly), and "Qin Xun" (侵尋) rhymes in opera are combined. In ancient times, "Qin Xun" were all closed-mouth sounds. Now, in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, these sounds are lost and read like "Zhen Wen" rhymes (only parts of Guangdong, Fujian, and Jiangxi still preserve closed-mouth sounds). "Geng Ting" was connected to "Jiang Yang" (江陽) in ancient times but later became a nasal sound. In Kunqu opera, it is read lightly and merged into "Ren Chen." The "Ren Chen" category all have palate-touching endings, which differ from the N in English and the NG nasal sound in "Zhong Dong." Therefore, neither Yin nor Yang tones can be used interchangeably with "Ren Chen." Peking opera emphasizes colloquial language. Sounds like "Jin Xin Yin" (金心陰) all touch the palate, and this has become customary, so there is no need to revert to ancient ways (the closed-mouth sounds of "Xian Lian Jian Xian" 纖廉監咸 are similar). Kunqu opera does not even use closed-mouth sounds, let alone Peking opera. The inverted "Dao Ban" (倒板) section of "Yu Tang Chun" and everything below it are in the "Ren Chen" rhyme, so it is not appropriate to mix in "Zhong Dong" characters. Adding the character "Cheng" (城) after "Hong Tong" (洪桐), using "Dao" (到) as a filler character, and then singing it as "(You Shei Zhi Yi Ma Dao Hong Tong Cheng) 又誰知一馬到洪桐城" is an excellent technique. The old version of "Yu Zhan" (玉盞) used "Yin Zhan" (銀盞), so it could be "Da" (打, broken). But if it's "Yu Zhan" (玉盞), it shouldn't be. Changing "Yan Qiu" (艶秋) to "Mai" (買) are both rising tones, but "Da" (打) is Yin rising tone, while "Mai" (買) is Yang rising tone. "Da" (打) is more resonant (the Yin and Yang of characters are not limited to level tones; they greatly affect the tune, including rising and departing tones). If "Zhi" (置) is changed to a departing tone with a subtle sound, it is far inferior to "Mai" (買). Peking opera emphasizes colloquial language and need not be elegant. Listening carefully to Yan Qiu and Gao Ting's recording of "Yu Tang Chun," it is still "You Mai Cui Pan Yu Cui Ping 又買翠盤與翠瓶." The "Hua" (花) character was a temporary mistake. The second time I heard Yan Qiu sing "Yu Tang Chun," it was still three hundred taels instead of one hundred taels. The first time I sat too far away to notice. When I saw that the lyrics printed on the program were one hundred taels, I thought it was better than three hundred taels, hence my previous comment. Whether it's three hundred or one hundred is nonsense. There is no need to audit it, no need to be as thorough as an accountant. A smile. My understanding of "Wu Tou" (務頭) differs from Tianxu Wosheng's. Zhou Deqing of the Yuan dynasty explained it in great detail, and Wu Qian'an explains it very clearly today. Certain sentences in opera are crucial and must use a specific Yin, Yang, and four-tone structure to meet the requirements for intonation. This is called "Wu Tou." Some Peking opera masters also know how to use "Wu Tou." It seems to have no connection with the closed-mouth sound of the "Qin" (侵) rhyme. This is not the main topic, so I won't elaborate. If you have any questions, I am willing to explain in person.</p>

For three days in a row, Zuo Shicheng hosted guests, rushing to the Small Garden every evening. On the fourth day, a helper from Lü Yi's room brought a guest. The hosting finally started with drums and gongs, making it lively for four days and not so lonely. The three floors added together made four signs, and theirs could be considered the best opening. A customer at a house downstairs had already promised to host a feast for them, but unexpectedly, the next night, he informed them that he had important business matters and would be taking a Yangtze River steamer to Hankou the following evening. Although that customer had somewhat retreated at the last minute, businessmen prioritize business. Drinking wine and enjoying courtesans is just a pastime. How could he delay his trip for a feast? But the lack of fanfare on the first day was considered a great humiliation for the brothel. That day, they forcibly dragged in a customer as a temporary filler, but they didn't ask their friends to host a feast. They wrote more than a dozen invitation cards, running all over the South City and Zhabei, exhausting the two helpers. They cursed the doorman in the hall, but only one friend came. The host and guest were both unhappy, so they ordered the people in the room to sit down, even treating the old nanny who cleaned the room as an honored guest. The next day was also empty. On the third day, only people from the venue and the establishment showed up. How snobbish the business world is! The madam at the entrance couldn't help but make sarcastic remarks, which made the young lady downstairs cry all night. The situation in a brothel is just like being an official. When you first arrive, you have to show your colors to make people look up to you, just like a new chairman who, if he doesn't show any results, will be looked down upon. Lü Yi is, after all, a young teacher, and people forgive her. Now, her performance is the best among the four houses, no wonder her mother goes in and out of the hall with a triumphant expression. No wonder the owner of the house downstairs asks the young teacher what dishes she likes to eat every day, and often adds dishes besides the regular menu. However, from then on, Zuo Shicheng was a frequent visitor at the Small Garden. If he didn't go to the Small Garden for three days, it felt like there was a graceful shadow in his mind smiling and beckoning him. When he was busy, he waved his hand and focused on his work. When he was free, his feet itched as if he wanted to run to the Small Garden. At worst, he would eat at a small restaurant. Whether or not he called a courtesan, after the meal, feeling a little tipsy, one or two friends would say, "It's still early. Let's go to the Small Garden to sit for a while." Zuo Shicheng couldn't refuse, and they dragged him along. Dear readers, you must know that anything in the world that can make people drunk can also be addictive. Wine can make people drunk, but not drinking makes people sad. Cigarettes and opium can all make people drunk, and smoking them is even more addictive. At this time, Zuo Shicheng was already intoxicated by Lü Yi, so going to the Small Garden every three days became an addiction.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Bar Fluctuations are Also Severe</h3>
<p>Plummeting Terribly to 9.9 Taels. Private Forward Deals Cause Bulls to Sell at a Loss. Yesterday, the gold price continued its weak trend, and the momentum has reversed. Although the price rose and fell in the early session, reaching over 17 taels, the price initially flattened and then declined in the later session, fluctuating by about 5 taels. However, the violent changes of the surge made it difficult to handle, and the morale of the industry was extremely panicked. The market was already showing a weakening trend. Due to large sellers and the release of bulls, Heng Xing Yuan, Xie Yu, Yuan Mao Yong, Tong Tai Chang, and Xin Heng were eager to sell, while Dalian Gang and Hong Li were keen to buy. Although the overseas silver market rose slightly in the previous day's telegram, the gold price opened high. Once rose to more than 649 taels. However, it was a fleeting moment, and it suddenly plummeted by more than ten taels. This was really because the buying trend rose. The foreign exchange market was also sluggish. However, the listed price remained unchanged. Only by noon did it reach 632-3 taels, which threatened to collapse and explode. Sellers in the later market remained strong, and suddenly fell to the 30 tael mark. Especially, the forward deals were not allowed. According to the exchange's regulations, they should be made on the 16th of each month, but they were made privately a day earlier. By yesterday afternoon, they had been transacted with each other, but it was very different from the previous period, and the bulls sold at a loss. This was because the end of the year was approaching, and there was no principal for the spot goods. It was related to the silver market. Therefore, the bears had to strive to enter the market. Initially, it was estimated to be around 3 taels, and later it rose to about 4 taels. This was why the bulls were selling. It is predicted that the large bars will see an upward trend this morning, etc.</p>
<p>Once, the high opened at 647 taels and 5 mace in January, up 6 taels and 5 mace (the gross opening was initially around 5 taels, and later rose to more than 7 taels, and the buyers were not silent).

The sluggishness of the market could not be suppressed.

The price plummeted by 10 taels from before 10 o'clock to 11:30, and the foreign exchange rate also followed the decline. Near and far term English gold were settled at 1.575.

Later, due to the fact that the firms had already started making forward deals, the price fell. It was only 32 taels, 5 or 6 mace. In a moment, it had already risen by 2 taels. Because Heng Xing Yuan bought in, and Sanjing and Huayi did the same for March English gold at 1.575. Korea and Datong mutually made a recent East exchange at 1 tael, 3 mace, 8 fen, 1 or 25. At 2:30, it was 34 taels and 7 mace, and suddenly it fell by more than 3 taels. The English gold in January came in and out at 1.575. HSBC also made a recent US dollar at 35 yuan and 8125. Shanghai issued April English gold at 1.58125, so after 3 o'clock it was 30 taels and 4 mace.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Initially Picks Up, Then Weakens</h3>

The foreign exchange rate of British and American currencies fell, while the Japanese and American currencies rose. Yesterday, the Kobe exchange rate slightly decreased. HSBC's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. However, the internal disk initially rose and then weakened. This was because the gold price turned high and low, which was already a reversal. The price plummeted by more than 10 taels. However, the day was full of dangerous storms and had a fluctuation of more than 19 taels. This was because large bulls emerged, and the forward deals were made earlier, and the bulls sold at a loss. Due to the fact that no one was receiving cash, it was not the same as the previous period. The people were extremely panicked. As a result, the exchange rates of various currencies were longer than last Saturday. English gold was longer by 2.5, US dollar was longer by 5 jiao, and Japanese gold fell by 1 fen.

<h3>The Yarn, Flower, and Yarn Markets are Softening</h3>
<p>The sluggishness of the yarn market is due to the weakness of the world's cotton industry and the approaching end of the year, which reduces the demand for yarn. Therefore, people's morale is not high. According to Japanese merchants, there is still an increase in bottom goods, so the intention to sell is quite strong. Chao Bang and Japanese merchants are unanimously shorting, but there are also quite a few retail investors who are hedging. In short, the actual sales are too poor and it is difficult to turn around in a short time. The Weakness of the Market is attributed to the trend of falling American cotton prices. The retail investors who sold in the market each fell by eight or nine cents and two or three discs. The retail investors who bought up in the market rose by three or four cents. However, the trend of selling in the futures market was more enthusiastic. As a result, the near market fell by four or five cents and the far market fell by seven or eight cents. The market atmosphere was calm in the afternoon, and each rose and fell by 1, 2, and 3 cents. The total transaction statistics for the day were 19,800 bales. The delayed record was 1,650 bales for Chabei, 1,100 bales for Rongxing, 900 bales for Lichang, 950 bales for Ruidai, 1,000 bales for Gongtai, and 7-800 bales for the rest. The purchases were 1,700 bales for Hengfeng, 1,000 bales for Yiyu, 1,650 bales for Changfeng, and 3-5-600 bales for the rest. The closing price is recorded on the left. Market Closing Rise and Fall Account Number March 1410 Rise 626550 December 1360 Rise 419300 April 1423825500 January 1378527950 May 1436511600 February 1392531550 Consumption is Flat.

The market price of Japanese yarn fell by one or two taels.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Has No Vitality</h3>
<p>The Trend of Falling American Cotton Prices is severe. The four-month contracts have all broken the 10-cent mark. However, the local bulls insist on this month because the sources from all routes are not strong and there is a saying that they will purchase more. However, the world market is unanimously trending downwards. The factories in the downstream are now stagnant. Therefore, the goal of Japanese merchants must be to see the changes after 30 taels. There is still a very large discovery. The Distant Month Han Standard is Neglected. The Han Standard opened in the market with the falling trend of American cotton. Each fell by 1, 2, and 3 cents. In the afternoon, the bulls purchased in the near month, and the market rose by 5 cents. The total transaction statistics for the day were 57,300 dan. The sales were 4,400 dan for Tianlong, 2,300 dan for Yicheng, 2,400 dan for Rongxing, and 1-2,000 dan for the rest. The purchases were 2,300 dan for Taishengkang, 3,200 dan for Changji, and 1-2,000 dan for the rest. The closing price is listed on the left. Market Disc Rise and Fall Account Number March 3085 Fall 15133400 December 116···75000 April 30852079900 January 115 Fall 5159400 May 30952035100 February 309010122200 The actual sales are extremely stagnant. The sales of the present cotton have almost disappeared. The factories are stagnant. The sources are 450 bales of Tonghua and 1,200 bales of Yaohua. Fire Machine Flower 31.00 Yongyu Factory purchases 300 bales. The Spot Goods are delivered to the Factory.</p>
<h3>Yarn Inventory Increased at the End of November</h3>
<p>At the end of November, the inventory of cotton yarn in Shanghai factories was 128,415 bales (excluding the warehouse inventory), an increase of 16,546 bales compared to the end of October. Among them, the Huaying Factory increased by 15,726 bales, and the Japanese Factory increased by 820 bales. Twenty-count and sixteen-count yarns</p>
<h3>US Government Relief for Agricultural Product Losses</h3>
<p>The US government, in order to provide relief for agricultural products, submitted a proposal to Congress to allocate $250 million in funds for relief. According to a New Orleans cotton industry report dated November 15th, the government, to provide relief for agricultural products, is purchasing raw cotton at 16 cents per pound and wheat at $1.15 per bushel. Purchases have commenced. Currently, the price of cotton has fallen to 11 cents per pound, and the price of wheat has fallen to 70 cents. It is estimated that this loss amounts to $60 million. This is only a superficial calculation; the actual loss is more than this figure. The government's allocated fund of $250 million has almost been depleted. It is now considering requesting a further allocation, but it is feared that Congress will not approve it.</p>
<h3>Grain and Flour Market Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market continued its sharp decline in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The quoted price of foreign wheat for forward months in Chicago fell by 70 cents, while Canadian wheat for near and distant months fell by 40 to 50 cents. Originally, when the foreign wheat prices fell but the exchange rate remained strong, there was no significant impact. However, the continuous heavy decline in market sentiment was due to recent forward purchases of spot wheat by various manufacturers over the weekend. This led speculators to believe that the surplus of foreign wheat was endless and that imports of wheat to China would inevitably increase. Consequently, confidence suddenly weakened, and there was widespread panic selling. Such a situation will be difficult to reverse unless there is a major change in foreign wheat. As a result, the current month's price fell another 2.5 cents compared to the previous day, January fell 2.25 cents, February fell 1.75 cents, March fell 2.5 cents, April fell 2.75 cents, and May fell 3.25 cents.</p>
<h3>This Month's Wheat Price Plummets by 12 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the future wheat market again experienced a sharp decline in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The decline in the current month was particularly severe. The falling price of foreign wheat had a significant impact. The continued purchases of foreign wheat by manufacturers seemed to deal a heavy blow to already nervous sentiments. The question of whether the foreign wheat contracted by short sellers in the current month could arrive became an issue. Now, the situation is clear, and delivery may be made as scheduled. Therefore, short sellers regained their momentum and increased pressure. Distant months also declined due to poor sentiment and panic selling. As a result, the current month plummeted by a massive 12 cents compared to the previous day, January fell 6 cents, February fell 5 cents, March and April fell 7 cents, and May fell 6 cents. Spot wheat remained stagnant due to inactivity by manufacturers.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian (客秈) Rice Sales Slightly Improved on the Local Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the appetite for Ke Xian rice on the local market improved slightly, but market prices were suppressed by the low prices of Du Rice from downriver, making it difficult to recover. Fortunately, the quantity available was not large, and the market was able to hold steady. Yesterday, 650 bags of early Jiangxi machine rice were sold at a price of $10.034; 153 bags of late machine rice were sold at $11.10; 500 bags of Nanjing machine rice were sold at $10.012 to $10.005; 100 bags of brown rice were sold at $8.50; and 140 bags of Liu brown rice were sold at $8.80. All were purchased by local merchants. Merchants from other regions remained inactive, except for some occasional inquiries about Ke machine rice from Xiamen merchants. After the influx of Yuan rice from downriver, sales of Yuan rice on the local market have been slow, and the price of Ke Yuan rice has been difficult to maintain. High-quality Hunan and Jiangxi machine Yuan rice only sold for $13, while mid- to low-quality rice fell to around $11.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Particularly "Show Mei," Experience Slightly Improved Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, on the local market, foreign firms and local traders showed a slightly stronger interest in "Show Mei" green tea from the Lu Zhuang and Tu Zhuang regions. The total volume of transactions was over 300 boxes, with prices remaining unchanged from the previous week. However, "Zhen Mei," an important type of green tea, still had an inventory of 30,000 to 40,000 boxes, and sales remained sluggish. Furthermore, after Russian firms stopped trading Gong Xi green tea, there was a complete lack of demand. The future of the tea market is extremely pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants Request Cancellation of Customs Warehouse System</h3>
<p>The export of Chinese tea is declining. The government, to promote foreign trade, has reduced domestic taxes by half and exempted export taxes. However, over the years, there have been discrepancies in the issuance and offsetting of import and export permits. This is because tea purchased by foreign firms must undergo various procedures of blending and re-processing before being packed into large boxes for export, with very few original boxes being exported. Currently, the customs authorities, to prevent the above-mentioned boxed tea from being exported without paying taxes, plan to collect export red and green tea in customs warehouses. However, according to customs regulations, goods entering customs warehouses must be directly declared for export and cannot be withdrawn. If this customs warehouse system is implemented, tea cannot be withdrawn from the customs warehouse, and the tea trade will inevitably come to a complete halt. The customs authorities should be aware of this point, hence this proposal. Recently, tea merchants from various provinces residing in Shanghai have been greatly alarmed and have jointly submitted a petition to Zhang Fuyun, the director of the Customs Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, requesting the cancellation of this customs warehouse system and offering the property of the Tea Industry Association as a guarantee to prevent foreign firms from exporting tea without paying taxes.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: New Qing Sugar Opens at 7.2 Taels</h3>
<p>The spot sugar market has seen declines. Yesterday, reports from sugar production areas were still lacking. In the public market, in addition to the sharp drop in the gold market, the exchange rate has slightly increased, and market sentiment is relatively stable, but buying interest is quiet, and sellers are gradually becoming more active. The opening transaction price was 8.45 taels, with inquiries quiet. In the later market, some transactions occurred at 8.4 taels, and the market was relatively stable. No. 20 medium white sand was priced at 7.65 to 7.625 taels, with market sentiment also flat. Transactions in regular sugar were even scarcer. TM marks traded slightly at 8.3 taels, YP marks traded slightly at 9.1 taels, YT marks were quoted at 8.6 taels, and YR○ marks were quoted at 8.1 taels, with limited buyers and a stable trend. Taikoo Refined Sugar offered B marks for delivery on the 15th day of the first month at a price of 7 taels for 5,000 bags, CW marks at 6.9 taels for 1,000 bags, and DY marks at 6.8 taels for 500 bags. All were newly taxed and still sold quickly, with prices then increasing by 1 cent, but there were few inquiries. No. 135 bags of domestic new Qing sugar have been opened at a price of 7.2 taels. Taiyuan rock sugar has also arrived, with 150 boxes offered at a higher price of 7 taels. At the same time, Wufu rock sugar also opened with 76 dan at a price of 7 taels, both showing strong sales. Also, yesterday's report mistakenly listed the price of new Qing sugar at 6.2 taels instead of 7.2 taels, and the price of Maqiu rock sugar at 6.3 taels instead of 6.2 taels. This correction is made here.</p>
<h3>Scarce Inventory of Hardware, Smokers' Tin, and Iron</h3>
<p>Smokers' tinplate is a popular item during the winter season. Every autumn and winter, its business is very prosperous. This year, there are few arrivals, leading to a more buoyant market. Prices have risen by 5 cents to 2 taels. After various groups in Zheng'an and Niuzhuang successively closed their ports, access to markets has been greatly reduced, and prices have fallen back. Three-by-six-foot sheets, from three to thirteen sheets, have each fallen by 2.5 cents. Due to the scarcity of goods, two-by-six-foot sheets can still fetch around 12 taels. In recent days, inventory has become even thinner, and access to markets has been quite smooth. As a result, the fewer goods remaining, the more the market price has gradually recovered. Currently, three-sheet goods are estimated at 9.4 taels per dan, four sheets at 8.85 taels, five sheets at 9 taels, six sheets at 9.15 taels, seven sheets at 9.25 taels, and eight to ten sheets all sell for 9.5 taels. Eleven sheets sell for 9.75 taels, twelve sheets sell for 10.025 taels, and thirteen sheets sell for 11.5 taels. Two-by-six-foot sheets, eighteen sheets, sell for 12.25 taels. Also, secondary goods sell for 11.5 taels. It is said that the goods that were opened in the past two days totaled four to five hundred bundles, and most of the buyers were local enamel factories, while only Qingdao among merchants from other regions showed some interest.</p>
<h3>Prices of Northern and Southern Orchid Seeds Rise Again</h3>
<p>Every year during the early spring season, orchid seeds have a new batch of "end-of-season, new flower" seeds available. According to reports from Zhangzhou yesterday, due to scarce rainfall this year, flowers have not yet bloomed. Therefore, the price of the previous batch of inventory has risen again, and the quantity is becoming increasingly tight in recent days. Yesterday, over ten pieces arrived by Jinan steamer from Xiamen, and they were immediately opened at a price that was one to two taels higher than before.</p>

<h3>Serious Situation Developing</h3>
<p>Water Price Increase Case</p>
<p>Municipal Council Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Meeting This Afternoon</p>
<p>New Situation May Develop</p>
<p>The following is a compilation of important news obtained yesterday regarding the public concession water price increase case:</p>
<p>Municipal Council Special Meeting: The Municipal Council held a special board meeting at 4:30 PM yesterday in the General Manager's office. Those in attendance included Chairman Macnaghten, directors Yuan Lüden, Okamoto, Fukushima, Xu Shi, Behr, Hu Mengjia, Bai Lang, Kaine, Xu Xinliu, Yu Qiaqing, Lai Lian, Liu Hongsheng, General Manager Fessenden, General Office Director Edward, and Associate Director Jones. The meeting was solely for discussing the water issue and adjourned at 6:50 PM. The meeting immediately resolved a stop-gap measure regarding the water price increase, ordering the Water Company to immediately restore water supply to the three households whose water had been cut off. However, the additional surcharge would remain in effect, temporarily accepted by the users. Regarding a permanent solution to fundamentally eliminate the price increase, it was also resolved that the Municipal Council would form a committee specifically to study a win-win solution to reduce water prices. The committee would be based on the Municipal Council's existing Public Utilities Committee, and foreign expert advisors would be invited to Shanghai to assist. The existing Chinese members of the Public Utilities Committee, Hu Mengjia and Wu Yunzhai, may be joined by one or two other Chinese representatives. Chinese directors told this newspaper reporter that during the meeting, there was a most difficult point to answer, namely that some landlords had already used the excuse of the water price increase to increase their rent even though the water price increase had not yet been implemented. The Municipal Council questioned the Chinese directors about this, who found it difficult to speak out. They hope that citizens will pay attention to this, as it will make the movement to reduce water prices even more effective.</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association General Meeting This Afternoon: At 7:15 PM yesterday, the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association was attended by five Chinese directors who attended the Municipal Council meeting: Yuan Lüden, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Liu Hongsheng, and Hu Mengjia. The association's secretaries Tao Leqin, He Dekui, Xu Fansun, and Shanghai Real Estate Association representative Li Bohan were also present. All agreed that the matter was of great importance and that an emergency representative conference should be convened immediately to discuss everything. It was decided to hold it at 3 PM this afternoon and immediately send express letters to all representatives. The letter stated: "Regarding the water price issue, it has been specifically set for 3 PM on December 16th (Tuesday) to hold an emergency representative meeting in the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's meeting room. In addition to the Chinese directors reporting on the Municipal Council's special board meeting, the meeting will also discuss countermeasures. Please take the time to attend."</p>
<p>British Consulate Expresses Position Yesterday: Chen Shiguang and Liu Yunfang, the Director and Deputy Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' office, visited British Consul General Brenan at 10 AM yesterday to discuss the water price issue. According to the British Consulate, the three households currently without water are completely behind on their water bills for three months. They can guarantee that water shutoffs will not occur again in the future. However, the price increase contract is of great importance, and it cannot be resolved in a few words. They will mediate the matter. This morning at 10 AM, Chen and Liu will visit the British Consulate again, and representatives of the Water Company will also attend to exchange views.</p>
<p>Installation of Water Meters Issue: This newspaper reporter inquired about the installation of water meters with the Water Company's manager and chief engineer, Mr. Pearson. He replied that the installation of water meters is inevitable, but it is only a matter of time. Nanshi, Zhabei, and the French Concession in Shanghai have already installed water meters. In Europe, the only country that has not installed water meters is the UK. As for the US, except for Chicago, all cities have installed water meters. It is still difficult to predict the water prices after the installation of water meters in the Shanghai Public Concession. It is generally hoped that the current 25% surcharge can be eliminated. As for the benefits to the company after adopting the water meter calculation system, the only benefit is to eliminate the unrestricted use of water by users. According to historical water consumption statistics, 25 years ago, each person used 10 gallons of water, but last year, each person's water consumption increased to 34 gallons. In theory, it should only increase to 18 or 20 gallons per person. Therefore, each person wastes about 16 or 17 gallons. This type of waste can be avoided after installing water meters. However, it is not yet possible to predict whether water prices after the installation of water meters will also vary depending on the amount of rent. However, this can generally be done. Currently, there are 15,000 landlords who have signed water contracts with the company, and three households have had their water supply cut off.</p>
<p>Contract Revision Issue: According to related sources, the contract between the Water Company and the Municipal Council is not impossible to revise, but it cannot be done overnight. Generally, this will also be handled by the committee organized by the Municipal Council. One point that must be revised in the contract is the excessively high guaranteed interest rate of 9%. Therefore, the key to reducing water prices lies in reducing this superior interest rate.</p>
<h3>National Calendar</h3>
<p>Settlement Expected to Be Flexible</p>
<p>Efforts by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Petition</p>
<p>Decision Pending at Today's Executive Yuan Meeting</p>
<p>The deadline for national calendar settlement is approaching, and the difficulties faced by various industries are becoming increasingly apparent. In reality, it is becoming difficult to comply. The following is an exploration of the latest news:</p>
<p>Complaints of Difficulties from Various Places: The year-end settlement according to the national calendar is proving difficult for various provinces and cities. Chambers of commerce in places such as Hangzhou, Anqing, and Wuhu have all sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai requesting postponement. Recently, the Yingkou General Chamber of Commerce also sent a letter stating that Yingkou's commerce is based on silver taels. The price of goods is also dependent on silver taels. The news of Shanghai switching to year-end settlement according to the national calendar has caused merchants owing money in Shanghai to urgently seek ways to repay it in order to maintain their credit. However, the loss from remitting these funds to Shanghai is truly unbelievable. The original price set by the Fourth Mao Mao Price Supervisory Office was 27.5 yuan per ingot, but due to the remittance of funds by various companies, the exchange rate has risen to over 2,890 taels. If this continues, who knows what the future holds? Furthermore, Yingkou's commerce is dominated by goods, with the amount of goods owed outside the city reaching tens of millions of silver taels every Mao, especially the Fourth Mao. It is customary to only repay these debts near the end of the Mao period. If one wants to demand payment in advance, it is impossible. This situation is also well understood by merchants in the south. Previously, the settlement for the lunar calendar was consistent between north and south, and there was room for adjustment. Now that it has been changed to the national calendar, debts for goods outside the city cannot be repaid in advance, and it is impossible to arrange alternative funding for debts in Shanghai. The difficult situation can be imagined. It is requested that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Money Trade Association notify all money shops to continue operating as before to avoid losses.</p>
<p>Efforts by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the reports from various industries indicate that it is necessary to request the government to allow flexibility in the settlement date. Although the previous request to change the total settlement date to the day before the Beginning of Spring has been rejected by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, various committee members are still seeking ways to request postponement. The last time Chairman Chiang Kai-shek came to Shanghai, Standing Committee member Ye Huijun personally went to Chiang's residence to submit a memorandum explaining the various difficulties faced by the business community in settling accounts according to the national calendar. When Chairman Chiang left Shanghai, Ye again went to the train station to bid farewell and appeal again. Standing Committee member Wang Yansong also strongly explained the difficulties to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and requested assistance.</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing's Petition in Beijing: Business leader Yu Qiaqing also felt that if this issue was not resolved satisfactorily, it would inevitably affect the financial market. He took the night train to Beijing last Friday to petition the Executive Yuan. The next day, he sent a telegram to the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wang Xiaolai, with the results of his petition. The original telegram stated: "Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, with respect, I have personally informed Vice President Song in person about the difficulties with the national calendar settlement. He has agreed to be flexible and will submit it to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval. A telegram will be sent to Mayor Zhang. He Deyuan." Therefore, the final resolution will depend on today's Executive Yuan State Council meeting. It is rumored that there will be a statement that settlement will still be handled according to the national calendar and that flexibility will be allowed. That is, settlement and payment will be separated into two periods. However, if this method is followed, it is still necessary to give serious consideration to the actual situation. Firstly, whether business can continue should depend on the results of the payment. If the payment and settlement periods are different, then there will inevitably be a standstill in commerce during this period between payment and settlement. This cannot be ignored. Secondly, the issue of layoffs can only be handled after the accounts of the employees are cleared. If payment is in mid-February of the national calendar, then the layoff date must be changed accordingly. This cannot be ignored. Currently, this issue should be discussed and resolved at today's State Council meeting before further plans are made. As for Yu, he had already returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Another Telegram of Appeal: When the Municipal Chamber of Commerce received the telegram from Yu Qiaqing in Beijing, it was holding the eighth meeting of the Executive Committee. Those present included Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Fang Jiaobo, Ye Huijun, Xu Jilun, Chen Songyuan, Wu Zhihao, Ma Jiliang, Lu Fenghang, Lu Qisheng, Luo Qinghua, Yan Esheng, and Zheng Chengqing. After detailed discussion, it was decided to send another telegram of appeal immediately. The telegram stated: "Vice President Song Junjian of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, we beg to report that the difficulties with the national calendar settlement are extreme. We earnestly beseech you to heed the sentiments of the business community and make a prompt decision to allow flexibility. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully."</p>
<p>Executive and Supervisory Committees Held in Advance: The regular meeting of the Executive Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was originally scheduled for Friday, the 19th. Because the settlement issue urgently needs to be discussed, it has been brought forward to Wednesday, the 17th, at 4 PM, and will be combined with the Supervisory Committee meeting to resolve everything.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Preparing to Celebrate New Year's Day</h3>
<p>The Puxi and Songjiang areas held their first preparatory meeting at Shicun Elementary School yesterday morning at 10 AM. The meeting was chaired by Municipal Committee Member Chen Ya'fu. The following key resolutions were made: (1) Regarding the method of celebration, it was resolved to hold a flag-raising, celebration, and group worship ceremony at 8 AM. (2) Regarding the designated celebration location, it was resolved to hold it at Shicun Elementary School. (3) Regarding the celebration lanterns, it was resolved that each agency would prepare their own. (4) Regarding the publication of a special "New Shanghai West New Year's Day" issue, it was resolved that the New Shanghai West newspaper editorial committee would be responsible for preparation. (5) Regarding how to promote the celebration of New Year's Day, it was resolved that this association would send letters to various organizations, schools, and stores in this area, urging them to hold enthusiastic celebrations. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<p>The Wusong area held an executive and supervisory committee meeting at the Wusong Eighth District Party Headquarters yesterday at 1 PM to discuss the celebration of the 20th anniversary of New Year's Day. It was resolved to (1) notify all organizations, large and small, and businesses to hang flags and lanterns to expand the celebration; (2) hold a group worship ceremony for all organizations in the morning; (3) hold a variety show at the Wusong Grand Theatre at 1 PM in the afternoon; (4) screen a movie in the auditorium of the Eighth District Party Headquarters at 7 PM in the afternoon; (5) request the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau to provide propaganda materials for promoting the national calendar; (6) have the Wusong Xunkan News publish a special New Year's Day issue; and (7) have the Party Headquarters allocate funds for New Year's Day celebration.</p>
<h3>Notifying Foreign Dignitaries of Participation</h3>
<p>The Office Sent Letters to Eight Countries' Embassies</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Office received a letter from the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday stating: "Please be advised that a military parade will be held in Beijing on the 20th anniversary of New Year's Day. Please inform the ambassadors and representatives of all countries stationed in Shanghai to participate, and after contacting them, please send a list of the names and titles of the participants to the Ministry as soon as possible." The Office sent letters to the British, Japanese, Belgian, Turkish, Polish, Finnish, Norwegian, and Cuban ambassadors and representatives stationed in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The Shanghai Municipal Government is also preparing to hold a joint celebration with the Songhu Garrison Command on this day. Mayor Zhang and Commander Xiong will invite the consuls of various countries stationed in Shanghai to participate.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Port Authority Closes Down</h3>
<p>Original Responsibilities Taken Over by Three Bureaus</p>
<p>The Municipal Port Authority has been in preparation for over two years. It has made considerable efforts in the organization of port affairs, such as the recovery of wharves and the regulation of coastline. However, due to an order from the Executive Yuan to temporarily suspend operations, it has been decided to close down at the end of this month. The original responsibilities will be taken over by the Land, Public Utilities, and Public Works Bureaus. The following is a summary of the situation:</p>
<p>The History of the Port Authority: Initially, when the Shanghai Special Municipality Organization Law was stipulated, there was a Port Authority in addition to the Finance and other eight bureaus. Former Mayor Huang Yingbai appointed Li Yizhi as director, but Li never took office after Huang left office. The Port Authority was only established after Zhang Dingren took office as mayor, and he appointed Xi Dingmo as director. In April and May of the 17th year, a preparatory office was established in the Hydrographic Survey Bureau of the Municipal Government Road in Fenglin Bridge. On August 21 of the same year, the organizational rules were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The organization was not established until December 22. Because the order from the Executive Yuan on whether or not to approve the organizational rules had not been received, two requests were made. In April of the 18th year, the Executive Yuan issued Instruction No. 1135, stating that it had been submitted to the five ministries of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Industry and Commerce, Transportation, and Military Affairs for review and opinions. They believed that the rules conflicted with the central government's powers and were difficult to implement. According to the presentation, the National Government issued Directive No. 446, transferring it to the Municipal Government for re-drafting. On May 10, it was revised and re-presented, omitting several items and adding detailed explanations to any misunderstandings. On January 21 of the 19th year, the Ministry of Transportation convened the ministries of Industry and Commerce, Navy, Finance, Military Affairs, Foreign Affairs, and the Construction Association for review. The Shanghai Municipal Government sent Director Xi Dingmo to attend and explain the rules item by item. The rules were then passed.</p>
<p>The Order to Temporarily Suspend Operations: After the first review by the six ministries, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan then ordered the Municipal Government to say that at a time when military affairs had just ended and finances were short, all government expenses should be reduced as much as possible. To save expenses and reduce disputes, the Port Authority of the Special Municipality was not urgently needed at this time and could be established after the concessions were recovered. It was also resolved by the State Council to postpone the matter. On March 5 of the 19th year, the bureau re-submitted the reasons why it could not be postponed, but it was not approved. Later, the city's organizational regulations were re-stipulated. In addition to the four bureaus of Finance, Public Security, Public Works, and Social Affairs in the organization law, five bureaus of Public Utilities, Hygiene, Education, Port Affairs, and Land Affairs could be established when necessary. The Municipal Government then decided to establish the five bureaus. As a result, the Public Utilities and other four bureaus were approved for establishment, but the Port Authority was still ordered to be postponed.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Two Extensions of the Closing Date: The Municipal Government then ordered the bureau on September 24 to close down by the end of October. The bureau presented the difficulties on October 27 and requested an extension of one month, which was approved. Later, on November 28, it requested another extension, which was approved by the Municipal Government until the end of this month.</p>
<p>The Takeover of Responsibilities: The bureau received Instruction No. 6613 from the Municipal Government on the 9th of this month stating that the case of the bureau's closure has been approved for extension until the end of this year. All original responsibilities after the bureau's closure should be pre-arranged for continued operations. The following decisions have been made: (1) The reorganization of the Nanshi Wharf and ship registration matters should be taken over by the Public Utilities Bureau. (2) The reorganization of coastline matters should be taken over by the Land Bureau. (3) The treatment of dyke matters and the dredging of waterways should be taken over by the Public Works Bureau. In addition to the separate orders to the various bureaus to follow the merging of the relevant parts, the bureau is also ordered to be informed and handed over separately at the time of delivery.</p>
<p>Revenue and Expenditure of the Port Authority: The bureau is a profit-making agency with three offices in addition to each department: the Nanshi Wharf Management Office in the Maojianong area of the Nanshi Bund, the Sand Fishing Boat Registration Office in Wusong, and the Dyke Construction Office in Gaoqiao. The total annual expenses for regular and business affairs are approximately 150,000 yuan, which is the least amount of funds among the various bureaus of the Municipal Government, accounting for about 2% of the total. After the reorganization of the wharves and coastline, the annual income from these two items is approximately 350,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Public Utilities Bureau Contacted Yesterday: The Public Utilities Bureau sent Secretary Xu to the Port Authority yesterday to contact them regarding the transfer of management matters. The bureau is said to have stated during the talks that it is currently closing down and will request receipt as soon as everything is properly arranged.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Minister to China Expected in Beijing</h3>
<p>The Office Cables the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Instructions</p>
<p>Met with Chen Shiguang and Liu Yunfang: The newly appointed Portuguese Minister to China, Mr. Navalho, visited the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 9 AM yesterday and met with Chen Shiguang. Chen accompanied Liu Yunfang to receive him, and they had a pleasant conversation for over ten minutes before he took his leave. Mr. Navalho is scheduled to go to Beijing within this week to present his credentials. The Office has cabled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request a date and then notify the Portuguese Minister. Mr. Navalho is currently residing on the fifth floor of the Huamao Hotel on the Bund. He told the visiting reporter that this was his first time in China, and Shanghai is indeed a bustling metropolis. He has had many contacts with Chinese people in recent days and has very good impressions. He was originally the Portuguese Minister to France. He was summoned back to his country by the government a month ago, and then he was assigned to come to China. His family is still living in Paris. He expects to go to Beijing in four or five days to meet Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting and arrange a date to present his credentials.</p>

After two weeks, when the ribs have gradually healed, surgery can be performed to remove the accumulated blood, and then the lung can expand as normal. The spine in the waist was not injured. Also, yesterday Yang's pulse was 93, and his temperature was 36.7 degrees. He was quite comfortable during the X-ray examination.

According to Dr. Bai, he should recover within four weeks.　　Regarding condolences and gifts, Ding Weichun, director of the medical office of the garrison headquarters, visited Yang at Baolong Hospital yesterday on behalf of Commander Xiong. He briefly spoke with Yang and inquired about Commander Xiong's condition. He was pleased to hear that he was recovering. Soon after, Mrs. Shao Lizi, Wang Jingzhen, and Zhang Huichang, director of the Aviation Administration, also visited the hospital. Zhang's conversation lasted the longest, about a quarter of an hour. Ms. Wang gifted Yang several bottles of chicken broth and a basket of oranges. Yang expressed his gratitude.　　Summary of condolence telegrams: Urgent, to Commander Xiong Tianyi in Shanghai, upon reading the newspaper, I learned with surprise that you were injured due to a mishap while flying. I hope you will rest and recover soon. Sincerely, Liu Zhi, bowed in Yuan. In addition, there are telegrams from Ma Fuxiang, He Jian, Wang Yinxi, Zhang Feiran, Xiong Yuxi, He Siyuan, Zhang Hongzao, etc., omitted for brevity. October nationwide.</p>
<h3>Decline in Exports to the United States</h3>
<p>Since the second half of this year, due to the global economic downturn, our country's exports to the United States have been quite sluggish. According to the statistics of the U.S. Consul General's Office in this port, the national exports to the U.S. in October were only worth US$5,139,839, a decrease of more than US$120,000 compared to September. The total value for the ten months of the year was US$91,202,105, also a significant decrease compared to last year. However, it has been found that the most significant decrease occurred between July and August, with a difference of nearly US$3 million in export value between the two months. Therefore, it is expected that the market situation may see a turnaround soon. Furthermore, the exports from Shanghai in November were only worth US$1,313,361, a decrease of more than US$470,000 compared to October. This is mainly because tung oil alone decreased by more than US$479,000 compared to last month. Although green tea exports to the U.S. increased by more than US$50,000, it was still difficult to reverse the decline. Hong Kong port.</p>
<h3>Alarming Gold Shipments to the United States</h3>
<p>Statistics from the U.S. Consulate　　Since our country prohibited the export of gold currency on June 1, Dalian in the north and Hong Kong in the south have become major channels for gold exports, as the ban does not apply there. According to the statistics of the U.S. Consulate in this port, the gold currency shipped from Hong Kong to the United States from June 1 to the end of October was worth US$8,924,160, including gold bars worth US$7,953,841 and gold coins worth US$970,319. Among them, August had the highest exports, with gold bars worth US$3,660,699 and gold coins worth US$430,000. This only refers to shipments to the United States alone. The number of shipments to other countries is likely to be considerable as well. If Dalian is included, the number would be even more astonishing.

<h3>Telegram to the Executive Yuan Requesting Approval of Industry Regulations</h3>
<p>Listing reasons and facts　　Requesting a general order for compliance　　The various industry trade associations of this city sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan yesterday, requesting approval of industry regulations, stating: "To the esteemed Executive Yuan of the National Government in Nanjing: Regarding the document approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce under No. 14438, which stated that a telegram was received, reporting that the industry representatives unanimously resolved on industry regulations in the general assembly, and requesting the Ministry to promptly implement and forward for review and approval, the branch office acknowledged receipt of the telegram. Upon investigation of the industry regulations, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs submitted three measures in the National Industry and Commerce Conference to the Executive Yuan for consideration. Please be informed accordingly." In response, the merchants of Shanghai were shocked since receiving the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's rejection of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's industry regulations. They then saw in the newspapers that the National Industry and Commerce Conference had passed the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs' proposed industry regulations, requiring all those in the same industry, whether or not they were members, to comply, which brought some stability. However, they still hoped for early implementation to relieve the suffering of the merchants. Therefore, they repeatedly held general assemblies of industry representatives and jointly dispatched representatives to Beijing to petition the National Government and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to maintain the regulations. In response to the previous approval, we hereby briefly state the meaning of the organization of trade associations and the need for industry regulations in law and in fact to your esteemed Yuan. The organization of trade associations is responsible for planning the development and reform of the industry itself, and for the government, it assists in the commissioned tasks of various public welfare projects. It is indeed a link between the top and the bottom. What this link relies on to maintain its tireless effort is industry regulation. If industry regulation can restrain those in the same industry outside the association, then those who join the association must not only fulfill the commissioned tasks of various public welfare projects of the government but also be subject to the constraints of industry regulation. It would be better for those who have not joined the association, as they can avoid all obligations in society and operate freely in business. The disadvantages are that not only do those who have not joined the association not want to join, but those who have already joined will also leave one after another, and the organization of the industry will immediately disappear. If the trade association disappears, there is no hope for improvement and rectification of commerce, and even if the government occasionally wants to start something, it will feel that there is no way to start. This is also a matter of inevitability and a matter of course. This is the first reason, in terms of the meaning of the organization of trade associations, why we should request prompt approval. Article 2 of the promulgated Trade Association Law states that trade associations must have the means to increase and maintain the common interests of the industry and correct malpractices. What is this tool and weapon? It is industry regulation. Moreover, Article 1 of the General Principles of the Civil Code states that if the law does not stipulate, it shall be based on custom. If there is no custom, it shall be based on legal principle. The so-called custom naturally includes commercial custom. Since commercial customs differ from industry to industry, how can the customs of each industry be expressed? In essence, the industry regulations of each industry are the written customs of each industry. They have a supplementary effect outside of commercial laws and regulations and do not violate public order. This is the second reason, in law, why we should request prompt approval. Industry regulations have always occupied an important position in the Chinese commercial system. If industry regulations are destroyed, business will inevitably be invaded and disappear. For example, the dyeing industry has been in constant disputes, and today it is difficult to survive. The sausage industry has a large export volume every year, but in the past, because there were no industry regulations, unscrupulous operators mixed in inferior goods, and the foreign government ordered a ban on imports due to health concerns, causing great damage to international trade. In recent years, it has been slightly restored to its former state thanks to the painstaking efforts of the Sausage Industry Association. For example, if the silver tael rate set by the Money Industry Association every day cannot be followed by all those in the same industry outside the association, then raising and suppressing will disrupt finance. This is the third reason, in fact, why we should request prompt approval. Based on the above conclusions, it is reasonable to telegram your esteemed Yuan to promptly approve and implement the three measures proposed by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs regarding industry regulations, and issue a general order for compliance to benefit commerce. We eagerly await your instructions. Sincerely, the Industry Regulation Protection Committee of various industry trade associations, bowed respectfully.</p>
<h3>Ling Hongxun Returned to China Yesterday</h3>
<p>Gained many insights in Europe　　Will discuss with the Ministry of Railways　　Ling Hongxun, former president of Nanyang Public School, director of the Public Works Bureau of Wuzhou City, Guangxi, and current director of the Longhai Railway Engineering Bureau, was dispatched to Europe by the Ministry of Railways to attend three international conferences on industrial education, applied mechanics, and reinforced concrete. He set sail from Shanghai on July 2 and returned to Shanghai yesterday on the Empress of Canada. Ling's relatives and friends went to the Customs Wharf to greet him.

He gained many insights from this trip and will make some recommendations to the Ministry of Railways. His wife, Shi Huifang, also conducted a detailed investigation of education in European and American countries and took many photos.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Local Autonomy Training Institute</h3>
<p>The general class opened yesterday　　Since the Shanghai Municipal Local Autonomy Training Institute was prepared by the Municipal Government, all facilities have been completed. The general class students reported to the institute on the 11th, 12th, and 13th and started classes yesterday. The first Prime Minister's Memorial Week was held at 9:00 AM, with the attendance of Director Yu Hongjun, Municipal Government Representative Huang Daoxiao, Dean of Studies Ma Chonggan, Dean of Students Chen Kecheng, Director of Affairs Zhu Weiyao, Professors Lin Zhongke and Wu Gengxin, Military Professor Han Tiexian, and more than one hundred staff and students. The spirit and order were very solemn. It is said that the opening ceremony of the institute will be held next week, and the list of those admitted to the special class will also be announced this week. There is also local news from this port on the following page.</p>

<h3>Price War in Chartered Cars</h3>
<p>Earnings cannot cover fuel costs　　Competition may have to be extended　　The rental price of chartered cars in this port was originally one yuan for every twenty minutes and three yuan per hour. After the exchange rate plummeted and gasoline prices soared, it rose to one and a half yuan for every twenty minutes and four yuan per hour, and the car companies agreed to abide by it. However, due to business competition, several Chinese car companies took the lead in reducing the price back to the old price to attract customers. Then, Huang Automobile Company also reduced prices in the same way. Yesterday, the Western companies Universal and Turner also restored the old prices at the same time in order to compete with the Chinese companies. Yunfei Company will also reduce prices in the same way starting this morning. At present, the value of gasoline is one yuan and one dime per gallon, and the cost of tires is also higher than before. The average hourly gasoline consumption for rental cars is about one gallon, and the income cannot even cover the cost of gasoline. It is indeed painful competition for the car companies. From the perspective of those who ride in cars, it is a great piece of good news. According to people in the industry, since the competition has begun, it may not end soon. This new price may be extended to six months or even more than half a year.</p>
<h3>Wet Nurse Was the Kidnapper</h3>
<p>Wang Yanxiang's son rescued yesterday　　More than ten kidnappers caught on Yuezhou Road　　Wang Yanqing, the current Chinese manager of Huifu Company, and Wang Yanxiang, Wang Yanqing’s younger brother, changed his name to Wang Jinshan at the police station, who specialized in real estate. He lived at No. 98, Fengyuli, Saposai Road, French Concession. On the 27th of last month, Wang's infant son, Bao Bao, who was just eleven months old, was suddenly abducted by his wet nurse, Tang Zhu from Anhui. The details have been reported in this newspaper. After his beloved son disappeared, Wang knew that the wet nurse was blinded by greed and wanted to extort a large sum of money. On the one hand, he reported the situation to the police station in charge, and on the other hand, he waited quietly. However, before a few days had passed, the kidnappers sent a letter asking for an exorbitant price. Wang ignored it. Later, letters came repeatedly, stating that the lowest price for ransom was 20,000 yuan. After negotiations by his family, there was still no result. Until the day before yesterday, the French police detectives learned the location of the hideout. Yesterday morning, at about 5:00 AM, Special Branch Western Detective Bartdi, Inspector Jin Jiulin, Head Detective Li Yaolong, Deputy Head Detectives Mao Jingen, Wang Rusong, Qian Yumin, Detective Zhou Buguang, etc., first went to the Huishan Police Station to meet with Chinese and Western detectives and went straight to No. 29, Yuezhou Road, Yuezhoufang. They first surrounded the house on all sides and then rushed in, rescuing the small hostage in the front building. More than ten male and female kidnappers were arrested on the spot and taken to the police station. After the police chief interrogated them one by one, one of the kidnappers directly confessed the details of the kidnapping, saying that they had first hired a car and parked it near the middle section of Ximen Road. Then, the wet nurse Tang Zhu brought the hostage to the car together. The police chief ordered them to be detained separately and sent to court for investigation in the Li Guoliang case.</p>
<h3>Record of Kidnapper Interrogation</h3>
<p>Li Guoliang testified in court yesterday　　Xu Jiajun admitted to initiating the kidnapping　　Li Shaoxuan and others confessed to going to abduct the victim　　Zhuang Ruibang and others admitted to guarding the hostage　　Li Guoliang, a native of Yunnan and the owner of Xingli Tin Mine Company at No. 818, Tongchunfang, Zhejiang Road, was suddenly invaded by four kidnappers armed with guns while having dinner at home on the evening of the 28th of last month. They threatened and shouted, and Li was kidnapped for a large ransom. However, after Li was kidnapped, Xu Jiajun, a fellow villager, went to Li's house to inquire and comfort Li's wife, Wu, who suspected Xu's actions. She reported to the police station, and the police chief instructed her to report and arrest Xu when he came again. On the evening of the 13th of this month, at about 11:00 PM, Xu went to Li's house again. Wu pretended to talk to him while leading the servant to report to the patrolman guarding the back door. Xu then left, saw the patrolman standing at the back door, and returned upstairs, opened the window and jumped to the neighboring No. 817, breaking through the door to escape. Li's servant chased after him. At that time, a patrolman No. 1117 from the Cai Zha Police Station happened to be nearby after taking a bath at the hot spring bathhouse. He heard the alarm and helped arrest Xu and took him to the police station. Under questioning, Xu admitted to the kidnapping of Li but did not know the location of the hideout, saying that it could only be known after the arrest of Li Shaoxuan (Yang Nanxuan) and Chen Zhenzhi (Xia Jizhi). The two lived at No. 128, Xinxinli, Jinshenfu Road, French Concession. The police chief ordered detectives Zhu Ziqing and Li Hanzhang to secretly go to the address with detectives from the French police station. They arrested Li, Chen, Cui Zhizhi, Yuan Gendi, and others and brought them back to the police station. Under questioning, Li Shaoxuan confessed that the hostage was hidden at No. 9, Fulu Li Road, French Concession. Detectives You Agen, Wang Changgen, Chen Ruhai, Zhang Liang, and others, assisted by Western detectives, went to the house fully armed and arrested Zhuang Ruibang and Zhou Zhiwei, who were guarding the hostage, on the fourth floor. They found two pistols and thirteen bullets under the pillow on the bed and rescued the hostage, Li Guoliang. They also arrested Yin Chengchang, Cheng Qingshan, Dong Qide, Wei Huizhang, and Yang Tang, and five women in the house and brought them back to the police station. The detectives who stayed at No. 128, Xinxinli, then arrested Zhang Kun, Shen Yongfang, Zhu Yunqing, and Xu Helin, and brought them back to the police station. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court, presided over by Judge Zhou Han. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the police station was prosecuting according to Article 2 of the Law on Punishing Bandits. On the day of the incident, Li and others were having dinner when someone knocked on the door. The maid, Li Xuezhen, went to ask who it was. The person spoke in a Yunnan accent and replied that he had important business to visit Li's cashier. When Li's maid opened the door, four bandits rushed in and threatened with guns. One bandit locked Li's family in a room, and three bandits helped Li upstairs. Before long, one bandit went downstairs and ordered Li's wife, Wu, to go upstairs. The bandit then said to Li's wife, "We are all fellow villagers and have long wanted to kidnap Li. Now, I have a letter for you." After saying that, he took out a letter and handed it to her and tied Li up in the car prepared outside the door and drove away. The content of the letter was no more than three points: (1) Do not report to the police; (2) Do not publish in the newspaper; (3) Do not let anyone know. On the 8th of this month, they received another letter, which was sent from the General Post Office, stating that if they did not continue to send tickets, they would have to take Li back to Yunnan. Since Li was kidnapped, the defendant Xu Jiajun went to Li's house to visit in the name of a fellow villager, and the police station was very suspicious of Li and asked Li Wu to report to the police when Xu came next time. Therefore, Wu ordered the police to arrest Xu, and the police detailed the situation of cracking down on the bandit's den, stating that the police now found that the car used by the bandits was rented from the Northern Automobile Company at No. 685, Minguo Road, by the defendants Shen Yongfang and Xu Helin. The driver, Xu Chunnian, drove to Lafayette Road, Lafeifang. The defendant Chen Zhenzhi got in the car and drove to Baisaizhong Road. Shen Yongfang took out a pistol and threatened Xu Chen. The two drove the driver Xu out and tied him to the bamboo fence in the nearby wilderness. Xu Helin then drove the car to kidnap the plaintiff. The bandits then abandoned the car on Jisi Fei'er Road. Today, the defendants Li Shaoxuan, Chen Zhenzhi, Wei Huizhang, and Zhang Kun can be proven by the plaintiff Li Guoliang and his wife and servants to have been at the scene of the kidnapping. Zhuang Ruibang, Zhou Zhiwei, Yin Chengchang, and Dong Qichang were guarding the hostages and can be proven by the plaintiff. Cheng Qingshan was responsible for cooking in the bandit's den. As for the female offender Yang Tang, she is Yin Chengchang's mistress. Cui Zhizhi is Zhou Zhiwei's mistress. Yuan Gendi is Dong Qide's mistress. The three women have all been to the bandit's den many times, so they cannot deny that they did not know. They should be severely punished according to the law. Then, Li Guoliang proved everything, which was roughly similar to what Lawyer Ru said. He only stated that Zhou Zhiwei had beaten him while guarding the bandit's den. Li Wu, Li Xuezhen, and Xu Chunnian proved the details of the incident. Interrogating the defendant Xu Jiajun, he stated that he used to work in the General Headquarters and served as the leader of a detective team in a certain army. I am a friend of the plaintiff. I initiated this matter, and Xiao Juewu was in charge of it. The rest of the confession was evasive. Li Shaoxuan, Chen Zhenzhi, Wei Huizhang, and Zhang Kun admitted that they had kidnapped the plaintiff and stated that Xu Jiajun had knocked on the door first. Zhuang Ruibang and Zhou Zhiwei admitted that they were guarding the hostages. Although the other defendants also confessed, they were all evasive. Then, the plaintiff proved that the defendant Dong Qide was very loyal in guarding the hostages and did not sleep at night. After Judge Zhou verified the confessions, he ordered the defendants to be detained separately and postponed the trial for a week.</p>
<h3>Bandits Robbed Patrolmen</h3>
<p>One bandit suddenly pulled out a gun and fired　　Fortunately, the patrolman was not hit and did not die　　Yang Delin, a patrolman from Yangzhou guarding the entrance of the Quangong Bank on Nanjing Road, was stopped by four thieves at the intersection of Shanxi Road and Nanjing Road at 3:10 AM yesterday on his way home. One thief was holding a gun. Patrolman Yang immediately shouted wildly. The thief with the gun dared to open fire and resist arrest. Fortunately, the gun did not aim accurately, and Yang was not injured. Soon, patrolmen No. 435 and No. 1357 nearby heard the alarm and rushed to arrest the thief who fired the gun, Wang A'gen, and his accomplice, Li Jinlong. The other two thieves escaped. They were sent to the Special District Court at 9:30 AM to investigate. Wang and Li both confessed that the gun was initiated by a monk who was at large. Judge Zhou ordered them to be detained and postponed the trial.</p>
<h3>Fujian Provincial Highway Committee Member</h3>
<p>Embezzled more than 400,000 yuan　　Fled to Shanghai and hid in the French Concession　　Arrested by detectives yesterday　　The Shanghai Special Municipal Public Security Bureau sent detectives Gu Liancheng and others to the French police station to report on the day before yesterday, stating that according to a document from the Construction Department of the Fujian Provincial Government, Deng Cheng, the director of the Shaoguang Highway Committee, a 56-year-old Fujianese, embezzled more than 400,000 yuan of public funds and fled to Shanghai, hiding in the Ganfeng Merchant Shop at No. 3, Shoukangli, Caishi Street, and Mofang Street under its jurisdiction. He requested assistance in arresting him. The police chief approved the request and immediately ordered detectives to assist in arresting Deng Cheng and taking him to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the French court for interrogation. The detective first went to court to state the case and requested permission to extradite him for trial. When asked, Deng confessed that he had come to Shanghai to recuperate last month, and the rest of his words were evasive. The Chinese and Western officials jointly ruled to hand over the defendant to the detective to take him back for trial. Gambling on flower games.</p>
<h3>Cutting Off the Head of a Dead Person</h3>
<p>Li Qinghai was eager to make a fortune　　The methods seem to be rather cruel　　There is a Li Qinghai in front of the Jiangxi Guild Hall behind the South Railway Station who is fond of flower games. He loses every time he fights. He is superstitious about divine power, which is inappropriate. He split open a masterless coffin and cut off the head of a dead person, saying that he could take it home and pray to it, and he would know what would be opened in the flower game. However, the police learned about it and arrested Li and sent him to the Second District Police Station. The head was also copied and sent to the District Court yesterday. The prosecutor interrogated him one by one. According to the confession, there were many flower game listening tubes and ships in the area. At first, he was lured into gambling and often won a little, but now he loses a lot, so he came up with this strategy. The judge considered his methods to be cruel and ordered him to be detained pending a heavy sentence. The head was put in storage pending the arrival of family members to claim it.</p>
<h3>The Public Utilities Bureau Tested the New Ship Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is actively carrying out the ferry service between the east and west sides of Pudong. The first and second ferries built earlier are operating between Shanghai and Donggou. Yesterday, the third and fourth ferries that were continued to be built were tested. At 1:30 PM, they departed from Dongjiadu and at 2:00 PM from Tongren Wharf and headed east to Gaoqiao. Many guests arrived, and Mayor Zhang also boarded the ship from Tongren Wharf at 2:00 PM. Director Huang Boqiao and the head of the Secretariat Section and others were all attentive. At 4:15 PM, they returned to Shanghai and headed south back to Dongjiadu. These two ferries were contracted by the Hexing Factory on Machinery Factory Street. Their style has been slightly modified compared to the previous two ferries. The lower cabin is a second-class seat, which is very spacious. There are also many windows and doors, and both light and air are sufficient. The cabin surface is a first-class seat, which is more than the previous boat, and the special class is on top. It is said that in the future, three ferries will operate between Shanghai, Xigou, Qingning Temple, Donggou, and Gaoqiao, with one ferry as a spare.</p>
<h3>Returned Overseas Chinese from Honolulu</h3>
<p>Established a Paris Cosmetics Factory　　Overseas Chinese groups are investing in various domestic industries and creating various handicrafts in many places. However, due to successive political changes and unstable situations, overseas Chinese groups have been suppressed. After the unification was completed and the political situation became stable, overseas Chinese compatriots who were planning to do something gradually emerged. It is said that several returned overseas Chinese from Honolulu recently founded a Paris Cosmetics and Pharmaceutical Factory at the eastern end of North Sichuan Road, Haining Road, in conjunction with the business community of the port. The factory has recently hired dozens of male and female workers and started rushing to produce various products. Soon, there will be a large number of goods available to meet the market and promote sales widely. It is also said that the factory's various products are made using the latest methods in the Paris cosmetics industry to produce various valuable goods, which are cheaper and of better quality than imported goods. They will be welcomed by ladies who love domestic goods and will be sufficient to recover some of the outflow of profits.</p>
<h3>Russian Piece Goods Will Defeat Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Customs Cannot Know the Exact Number　　The Chinese-language newspaper "Zi Lin Bao" reported that recently there have been rumors that Russia is shipping a large amount of wheat to Shanghai and selling it at a reduced price, disrupting the market. This is obviously absurd with a little thought. The areas that produce wheat in Russia are in the western and central parts of the country. Even the eastern part of Siberia lacks food and buys wheat from Canada for assistance. How can there be surplus wheat for export? If you really want to transport it from central Russia to the Far East by rail, the cost of transportation is far higher than that of ships. Its value can never compete with the cheap American wheat. However, in the piece goods market, Russian goods have begun to flood the market and will become increasingly severe. It is said that a Chinese merchant in Shanghai has signed a contract with the manager of a Russian textile industry to purchase at least 1.5 million taels of silver each year. These piece goods will be sold to stores across the country. The selling price can be 30% lower than similar goods from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. In the past, Japan was a strong enemy of British and American cotton merchants with its cheap goods. In the future, Japanese merchants may also have to pack up their samples and return home in defeat. Even British merchants with higher prices will be unable to catch up with or defeat the Russians. The extent to which Russian piece goods flood the Shanghai market cannot be determined by customs statistics, because most of the goods are transported by land to Tianjin and Qingdao and then transshipped to Shanghai as transit goods, so it is difficult to know the exact number.</p>
<h3>Westerner Dalvenly</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, he was suddenly shot. Whether it was suicide is unknown. His life may not be in danger. The Westerner Dalvenly of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Engineering Department, who lives at 449 Dixwell Road in Hongkou, finished breakfast yesterday morning at nine o'clock and went to the upstairs bedroom. Not long after, the family downstairs heard a loud bang. They rushed to the bedroom and saw Dalvenly lying on the floor, a bullet through his chest, bleeding profusely. He was immediately sent to the Country Hospital for treatment. It is said that Dalvenly's attitude was normal on weekdays. It is really difficult for outsiders to predict whether the shooting was suicide or an accidental injury while cleaning a gun. It is said that his injuries may be salvageable.</p>
<h3>Taibao Ashu Gang's Three Robbers</h3>
<p>The headquarters issued an order for execution on the spot. A proclamation (Law No. 60) from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters stated: Regarding the case, Hu Zhengji, commander of the Songqing Jinping Bandit Suppression, reported that the first district unit of the Jiangsu Maritime Public Security Team had captured three robbers, Pan Sijin, Zhu Xiangming, and Xue Asan, in Jinshan County and other places, requesting interrogation and handling. According to their confession, they were robbers under Taibao Ashu Gang, brazenly robbing places such as Xincang Qianjiawei. The interrogation was clear. According to Articles 1 and 9 and 13 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Bandits, each should be sentenced to capital punishment. In addition to the fugitives Taibao Ashu, Pan Amu, Wang Ajiu, Lin Asi, Zhang Axiang, Yu Awu, and Xu Atao, who have been ordered to be arrested, Pan Sijin, Zhu Xiangming, and Xue Asan are hereby identified and sent to the first district for execution on the spot to serve as a warning. Let everyone know this proclamation. List of executed bandits: Pan Sijin, 34 years old, from Jinshan; Zhu Xiangming, 28 years old, from Songjiang; Xue Asan, 39 years old, from Jinshan.

<h3>Rickshaw Exchange for New Licenses Extended for Half a Month</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Proclamation</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities issued a proclamation yesterday stating: Regarding the matter of rickshaw exchanging for new licenses, it has been handled since December 1st. Those who have received old licenses but have not exchanged them by December 15th will have their license numbers cancelled and the original deposit fee confiscated, as previously announced. Because there are still many rickshaw owners who have failed to exchange their licenses as scheduled, the deadline for returning the old license deposit fee is extended to the end of December. If the exchange is still not done by the deadline, the original deposit fee will be confiscated. This proclamation is hereby issued for general knowledge.</p>
<h3>North China Daily News Benefits Rickshaw Pullers</h3>
<p>Collecting Relief Funds for Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<p>The North China Daily News in this port collects relief funds for rickshaw pullers around Christmas and sends them to the Rickshaw Pullers' Gospel Society to purchase clothing, shoes, and food to donate to the general public. Rickshaw pullers serve the society and are meritorious and hardworking. However, they are poor and helpless, hungry and cold. This allows them to provide their parents, wives, and children with a warm meal for one night. There is no shortage of wealthy and benevolent people in this port. They usually feel deeply concerned about the rickshaw pullers' meals in the wind, sleeping in the open, rain, and sun, running like cattle and horses, but still not getting a full meal. Taking advantage of this opportunity, they can generously open their wallets and widely give alms, so that the rickshaw pullers can obtain the real benefit of warmth and shelter, and we can also slightly fulfill our long-cherished wishes and easily obtain spiritual comfort. The Rickshaw Pullers' Gospel Society has been established for 18 years and specializes in seeking welfare for rickshaw pullers. They know the needs and sufferings of rickshaw pullers best. The number of poor rickshaw pullers who have benefited from them on weekdays is countless. Therefore, it is most appropriate to hand over money to them to handle relief items. This donation can be sent to the North China Daily News office at 17 Bund.</p>
<h3>Case of the Tragic Murder of a Mistress Re-examined</h3>
<p>Yang Guoming said he felt like he was dreaming when he committed the murder.</p>
<p>Yang Lindi, the wife of Jiang Zhongfu from Changzhou, had been having an affair with Chang Guoming, a shoemaker in the Lane near McGinness Road and the Shanyue Yi Shantang, for a long time. Recently, she suddenly became tired of him. At 11:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, Lindi was walking through the lane when Yang forcefully invited her to his house at 348 Lane. Yang took a knife and killed Lindi. Yang was also arrested and detained on the spot. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police first took the murderer to the Special District Local Court for interrogation. Because the body had not yet been inspected, he was ordered to be taken to the forensic examination office on Feren Road. Prosecutor Guo was then appointed to the office to verify that the deceased died from a knife wound to the neck. When questioned, Yang Guoming confessed that Lindi was his mistress. She had previously told him that she had never been married and had cheated him out of 145 yuan. Later, she suddenly broke up with him. Regarding yesterday's incident, he said that he felt like he was in a dream and did not know why. He only remembered that Lindi had first taken his knife and tried to slash him, but he snatched it back and slashed her head. Then, the deceased's husband, Jiang Zhongfu, testified that he did not know Yang and did not know that his wife was having an affair with him. Now that his wife had been tragically murdered, he requested justice. Prosecutor Xu then instructed Jiang Zhongfu to sign a statement and take the body for burial. Yang Guoming was detained. The case has been prosecuted and is awaiting sentencing.</p>

<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>New Locomotive to Test Run Today</p>
<p>Traveling Between Shanghai and Kunshan</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway previously found that the original locomotives were insufficient for distribution due to business development, and their age had reduced their speed. In order to make travel more convenient, the authorities ordered eight Pacific-style locomotives from the British Great Northern Company. After they were shipped to China last month, the Wusong Locomotive Factory of the railway gradually assembled them in order. Yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m., one locomotive left the factory and drove to Shanghai, stopping at Platform 4 of the North Station. Director Liu Weichi personally boarded the train to hold the departure ceremony. Chief of the Locomotive Department, Chief of the Transportation Department, and Chief of the Engineering Department, along with their deputies, all attended the ceremony on the platform. It is now scheduled to tow the No. 15 train heading upward between Shanghai and Kunshan at 11:00 a.m. today to test its speed in order to guide long-distance travel. Chief of the Transportation Department Liu Chengchang, Chief of the Locomotive Department Fenci, and several technicians from the Great Northern Company will travel on the train together to conduct detailed assessments in order to revise the standards for future schedules. It is found that this type of locomotive is the newest in various countries, and both coal loading and ash unloading are done by machine (old machines require manual labor), so the firepower is very even. In the future, the time for towing passenger cars can be increased by a quarter.</p>

<h3>Dongfeng's Major Damage Case from Collision</h3>
<p>Japanese are Trying to Deny Compensation</p>
<p>Negotiations Fail, Arbitration</p>
<p>In recent years, when Japanese ships have caused accidents, they have often damaged Chinese ships and then tried to evade responsibility. Cases such as the Houda's New Daming case, the Ryuno's New Kang case, and the Jing Shan's Xin Feng case have not yet been resolved. In the summer of this year, the Dongfeng Wheel of the National Aviation Industry Company was damaged by the Japanese ship Kagomaru in the Minhai Sea, with a loss of more than 100,000 yuan. The responsibility has been proven to be entirely due to the Japanese ship's error, but the Japanese initially tried to cover up the matter, then delayed it, and now they are formally negotiating and using cunning means. The details of this matter are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Violate Navigation Rules: The Dongfeng Wheel was transporting goods from Shanghai to Shantou and was about 40 miles from Fujian. At that time, there was a slight fog. The Dongfeng was traveling according to the route. When the Japanese ship Kagomaru was seen, the Dongfeng quickly sounded the whistle, and the Japanese ship also slowed down to comply with the navigation regulations. Unexpectedly, the Japanese ignored it and proceeded at full speed, as if they had not seen the Dongfeng. When the two ships were close, the Dongfeng shipowner was shocked and wanted to reverse to avoid it, but it was too late. The starboard side of the Japanese ship Kagomaru violently collided with the head of the Dongfeng, and the entire bow of the Dongfeng was knocked off, with a loss of more than 100,000 yuan. The middle cabin of the Japanese ship was also severely damaged.</p>
<p>Confirmation of Responsibility Issues: After the Japanese ship caused the accident, it suspected that the Dongfeng Wheel had sunk. The shipowner wanted to cover up the mistake, so he sent a telegram to the port, not mentioning the collision with the Dongfeng and falsely claiming that the ship had run aground and damaged the middle cabin in the Minhai Sea. When the ship arrived at the port for repairs, the Dongfeng was also towed to the port by the China Merchants Bureau. The Japanese ship saw that the Dongfeng had not sunk and knew that it could not hide the accident, so it fabricated a report claiming that the two ships had collided with each other and the Dongfeng should also be responsible. However, after the Dongfeng arrived at the port, it immediately reported to the Hong Kong Marine Department for on-site inspection and investigation. The results proved that the responsibility for the accident lay entirely with the Japanese ship's error and it should be liable for compensation.</p>
<p>The Delay in Negotiations: The Dongfeng was damaged and the repair cost in the port was 56,000 taels. The loss of the head cabin was worth 50,000 taels. The company filed a negotiation, but the Japanese initially ignored it. After the National Company urged it, the Japanese Post Office replied that the Kagomaru was also damaged and the loss of goods was more than 170,000 yuan, but the issue of responsibility was not discussed, and the responsibility was shirked and evaded, just like the Ryuno's sinking of the New Kang.</p>
<p>The Chinese Side Will Submit to Public Judgment: The National Aviation Industry Company entrusted Chen Shuntong to negotiate with the Japanese side on this matter. The Japanese Post Office has sent the Chinese manager Li Zichun to discuss with Chen for days. The Japanese side intends to settle this matter immediately and insists on not compensating for the losses. Our side believes that the accident was entirely caused by the Japanese ship's disregard for the Chinese ship's maritime return sound and ignoring the lives and property of Chinese ships. Afterwards, they tried to shirk responsibility. Chen has decided to hire a navigator arbitration committee to publicly judge the case because the negotiations have failed.</p>

<h3>British Economic Delegation Will Specialize in Inspection</h3>

<h3>Department Order Requiring Chinese People to Take Chinese Ships</h3>
<p>Shipping Companies Should Improve and Offer Preferential Treatment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association received instructions from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating: "In order to issue orders, the Executive Yuan's Correspondence Office sent a letter from Jiang, the concurrent president, forwarding a letter from the Central Organization Department of the Central Executive Committee, submitted by Wu Huizhu and others, Filipino overseas Chinese businessmen, requesting the issuance of a circular ordering compatriots at home and abroad to maintain the domestic shipping industry." I have copied the original document and sent it to the department for investigation. Our country's shipping industry is not prosperous and it is difficult to compete with foreigners. The loss of rights and interests is most serious. The various points mentioned in the original submission of the overseas Chinese businessmen are really out of patriotism. All our merchants and people should be aware of this. Especially for shipping business, we should strive to improve and offer preferential treatment to passengers in order to promote the people's patriotic enthusiasm and avoid the loss of interests that have been recovered. In addition to distributing it to the provincial governments to order them to transfer it to various people's organizations for widespread persuasion, the original document is hereby copied and ordered to be obeyed by the association and transferred to all shipping companies for compliance with this order."</p>
<h3>A Record of the Renovation of the Jiangnan Shipyard</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Shipyard in this port has perfect equipment and excellent art. It is the only shipbuilding institution in our country. It has built many warships and merchant ships and has a high reputation. However, recently, due to the price of gold, it has suffered losses in building merchant ships. Moreover, the workers are tired and slow, and they do not know how to save materials, which also has a great impact. After Ma Deji resigned due to illness, the director of the shipyard was concurrently held by Chen Shaokuan, the vice minister of the Navy. He has repeatedly instructed the workers, and the office hours of the staff have been moved forward. They must sign in no later than eight o'clock every morning. There is a great atmosphere of innovation. The Party Department of the shipyard has also done a lot of propaganda to the workers. The Party Department issued a letter to all the comrades of the workers yesterday, mostly words of encouragement, in order to inspire and achieve remarkable results.</p>
<h3>Testing Pilots of Various Ships</h3>
<p>Will be Implemented from Tomorrow</p>
<p>In order to create pilots for various ships, the Navy Department first started with the Yangtze River and specially established a pilot training institute to teach specialized courses. Yesterday, the institute informed various Chinese ship bureaus that it had hired the director of the Coast Guard Office to go to various Yangtze River ships on the 17th of this month to test the pilots currently in service in order to determine whether they are qualified for the job. Yesterday, various companies have informed the personnel in charge of the river route on each ship to wait for the test on the ship from tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Three Yangtze River Ships Attacked by Bandits</h3>
<p>Jiangshun: The bandits in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have risen in large numbers. It was reported yesterday that the Jiangshun of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was attacked by communist bandits. It is now known that this ship encountered fog on the 10th night in the Huangzhou area, so it was temporarily anchored about ten miles upstream of Tianjia Village on the morning of the 11th to avoid it. Unexpectedly, the area happened to have a communist bandit riot memorial meeting with six or seven hundred people. When they saw Jiangshun, they opened fire and sent a team of communist bandits on small boats to the wheel to rob it. Fortunately, the soldiers stationed on the wheel fired and repelled them, but more and more communist bandits arrived and fired wildly. Four or five bullets hit the head and tail cabins of Jiangshun. Fortunately, no passengers were inside. Seeing the situation was critical, the shipowner risked escaping in the fog and managed to escape.</p>
<p>Wuhu Taikoo: The Wuhu wheel of Taikoo Steam Navigation Company, which was traveling with Jiangshun, was also anchored in one place. The communist bandits could not rob Jiangshun, so they tried to rob Wuhu. The bandits divided into three teams and fired at Wuhu. British soldiers on the Wuhu ship immediately set up machine guns and swept the south bank, and the bandits took refuge in the trenches. Seeing that they were about to fire artillery, Wuhu also risked going downstream in the fog. The outer side was also hit by bullets, but fortunately no one was injured.</p>
<p>Ruihe: The Fuhe of Jardine Matheson &amp; Company's upper Yangtze River ship was attacked by bandits above Chenglingji. Bullets hit the cabin, and the hand of the first mate was penetrated by a bandit bullet and was seriously injured. When the Ruihe wheel went downstream and passed Tianjia Village, it was also attacked by bandits. Fortunately, it sailed close to the north bank, and the British soldiers guarding the ship fired back. It lasted for twenty minutes before it stopped, and the passengers on the ship were terrified.</p>

After the ceremony, Chairman Fan Zhengbo reported on the purpose of the meeting, which was about three points: (1) To unite the Henan people in Shanghai and consolidate their fellow villagers' friendship. (2) To call on all circles to raise funds for disaster relief in Henan in the name of the entire association. (3) To relieve the suffering and helplessness of the Henan fellow villagers in Shanghai.

The suffering of the people was unbearable to hear. Then, Wu Jiaze, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a training speech, and the meaning of the words was earnest and detailed, which was awe-inspiring. It was extended to about 6:00 p.m. before the meeting closed.

It has sought the consent of the majority of members and renamed it the "Pacific International Society" from January 1, 20th year of the Republic of China. It is heard that the association has now sent a circular to all members to inform them.</p>
<h3>News of the Two Country Exhibitions</h3>
<p>Suzhou: The Suzhou National Goods Mobile Exhibition will be opened on December 25 after the resolution of the all-Shanghai National Goods Factory representatives' meeting yesterday.

<h3>Stamp Duty Should Not Be Affixed to Draft Books</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied to the Lanxi County Business Association yesterday, stating that stamp duty should not be affixed to store draft books. "Respectfully, we received your letter on the 13th of this month stating that the tax bureau forcibly ordered the stamp duty to be affixed to draft books and claimed that Shanghai and Hangzhou have implemented this. Please check and reply whether this is true." According to the Standards for Stamp Duty Affixation, the stamp duty regulations led by the National Government should be taken as the basis, and each tax bureau cannot make its own claims. The store takes business as its duty. What is not related to business? If it is said that it is related to business, stamp duty must be affixed. Why is it necessary for the stamp duty regulations to list each article and only make a general rule that all pieces of paper and words related to business must be affixed with stamp duty? The branch bureau's claims are unprecedented. The association dare not speculate about the situation in Hangzhou. The tax bureau in this city does not have this practice. Sincerely, the Organization and Unity Committee of the Lanxi County Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Editor, I read in your newspaper's Shanghai news on the 14th that the article about Commander Xiong's injuries stated that the Ministry of Finance sent representative Hu Lansheng to the orthopedic hospital yesterday to inquire about his condition. It also stated that Mr. Hu is a doctor and is currently the director of the military medical department and will soon take office. As far as our association knows, Mr. Hu is just one of the ordinary doctors, and there is a record of Mr. Hu being the director of the military medical bureau. Not only are the members of our association deeply confused, but all active-duty military doctors will inevitably be involved in disputes as a result. Therefore, we, the members of the association, firmly believe that the information in your newspaper must be a rumor. We specially request that you correct it in order to dispel public doubts. We look forward to your reply. Sincerely, The Shanghai Army Medical Students Association, December 19th, 25th year of the Republic.</p>

To close, the button was pushed up, and to open, it was pushed down. This opening method often made a small popping sound, so it was commonly called a soda cannon. Now, Coca-Cola uses completely mechanical bottling, never touched by human hands. Each bottle is first boiled and disinfected with a strong alkaline water, then rinsed with clean water, and then Coca-Cola is poured in, and the bottle is sealed with a mechanically sealed stopper made of a combination of rubber and metal caps.

<h3>The Vanguard Weekly, Issue 21, Nanxin</h3>
<p>The recently published issue number 21 of The Vanguard Weekly is more organized than previous issues. The selection of materials is cautious and truly pioneering in the publishing world. The reason it can attract most readers to eagerly read it is that it possesses a correct central ideology. Whether it pertains to the textual aspect, it displays a unified outline. At the same time, it determines a kind of consciousness centered on nationalistic literature and art for the objective demands of the readers. Therefore, The Vanguard Weekly has become the most powerful literary publication, and the vividness of its writing can grasp the reader's entire heart. This is extremely evident. This issue contains five articles, which are substantively more advanced: (1) Xiang Hua's "On Nationalistic Drama"; (2) Su Ling's "Night in the Borderland"; (3) Zhang Jiping's "Two Different Kinds of Humans"; (4) Jin Xuan's "A Discussion on Novelists and Plagiarists"; (5) Zheng Bo's continuation of "Two Orphans." These are all powerful works that are not easily found in other publications.</p>
<p>China's theater scene is truly desolate beyond description. Old dramas are filled with otherworldly traditions and feudalistic ideas, which greatly hinder the development of the Chinese nation. In a period when the Chinese intellectual world contains great crises, ideas like these should never be instilled into the minds of young people. Even so-called reformed national opera is merely the same old wine in new bottles. No matter how reformed it is, this intense feudalistic ideology and traditional consciousness cannot be lessened or completely destroyed, and adding an upward-looking and correct view of life is certainly impossible. Since this is the case, the so-called reformed national opera is just that. As for the recently popular spoken drama, it is equally disappointing. The so-called central ideology is even more incorrect, tempting young people to embark on paths of delusion and extremism, which makes us even more heartbroken. This is also a sign of the decline of new drama. Therefore, Xiang Hua's "On Nationalistic Drama" is truly worthy of our attention. The author writes at the beginning:</p>
<p>"Chinese drama has never been on the correct path. Old dramas and 'civilized dramas' need not be mentioned, but even the recently very popular spoken drama is similarly lost and walking towards its end. This is an obvious objective fact before our eyes, and no one who pays attention to the Chinese theater scene will deny it."</p>
<p>"...Over this long period, old dramas and 'civilized dramas' have long lost the spirit of the times and artistic value. In today's high tide of our national movement, these feudal remnants and corpses are of course not allowed to have any foothold. As for spoken drama, several 'love beauty theater groups' have made efforts in this area recently, such as Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice,' Chekhov's 'Uncle Vanya,' and Tian Han's revised translation of 'Carmen,' all of which have been performed on Chinese stages. However, because these people engaged in drama do not have a correct consciousness and cannot take into account the objective needs of our nation's awakening today, some move foreign aristocratic bourgeois plays, and some turn nationalistic plays into propaganda slogans, resulting in no achievements and ending in failure." The author's elaboration on the above is truly incisive and thorough. Indeed, the Chinese theater scene before our eyes is a huge crisis. Those with a nationalistic central ideology certainly cannot bear to see Chinese drama sink like this. So, "we must forge a bloody path and begin the construction of our nationalistic drama theory." Xiang Hua's essay, said to be about 20,000 words long, is the foundation for building this theory. The most important thing "is that the existence of feudal remnants cannot be allowed, and the Chinese theater scene must be cleared." The initial argument is how to "clear the feudal forces from the theater scene." The author's argument on this point is particularly insightful. Due to space limitations, I apologize for not being able to quote it in detail. Next to be introduced to the readers is Su Ling's poem.</p>
<p>"Night in the Borderland" depicts the scenery of the northern lands, the soldiers' songs, and the state of war. The author's artistic skill is very high, so the light description contains profound meaning. In terms of poetic technique, it can also be said to have achieved the highest point of art. In any case, this poem makes us feel unexpectedly satisfied after reading it. For example:</p>
<p>Wine cups raised high in the hands of soldiers,</p>
<p>The hearts of the soldiers are like raging fires.</p>
<p>In every pair of resolute eyes,</p>
<p>There is a fierce flame waiting to erupt.</p>
<p>Wine cups raised high in the hands of soldiers,</p>
<p>The soldiers sing together facing this blood-colored wine.</p>
<p>Tonight, tonight, soldiers,</p>
<p>Let us drink this cup of blood wine!</p>
<p>By tomorrow morning, the sun will climb the horizon,</p>
<p>Soldiers, we swear to capture the violent enemy!</p>
<p>A poem like this has a humorous and magnificent atmosphere, which is not easily found in the poems published in various publications. Yes, readers who sing the poem verses quoted above can believe it without a doubt.</p>
<p>In addition, Ji Ping's rigorous criticism, Jin Xuan's sharp discussion, and Zheng Bo's fluent translation are all must-read powerful works. The content of these three articles can only be appreciated by the readers themselves.</p>
<h3>Early Sun Bi-Weekly, Gao Wei</h3>
<p>Issues 1 and 2</p>
<p>Edited by the Hangzhou Early Sun Society</p>
<p>Since the waves of the nationalistic literary and artistic movement have risen to the clouds, the situation in China's literary and artistic circles has indeed entered a turning point. Not only has it shown a vigorous phenomenon in Shanghai, the origin and foundation, but it has also spread and permeated the mainland. Originally, the literary and artistic circles in the mainland were deeply isolated from literary and artistic trends due to the closed atmosphere, but this time, the nationalistic literary and artistic movement is different. Contrary to the past, in just a few months, it has transformed the literary and artistic circles in the mainland into another aspect, forming the same feeling that only nationalistic literature and art can overthrow all old potential forces, break through that morbid crisis, and create a new situation. This is naturally because nationalistic literature and art is the urgent demand of all national members in this era, so as soon as it is launched, everyone immediately responds. The first thing we saw was the activity of Nanjing's literary and artistic circles. Various publications, such as Development Monthly, which were produced successively due to the upsurge of the nationalistic literary and artistic movement, have already been introduced here. Now, let's talk about the situation in the literary and artistic circles by the West Lake. We have finally discovered a kind of nationalistic literary and artistic publication, "Early Sun Bi-Weekly." In the past, everyone in Hangzhou's literary and artistic circles knew that they were intoxicated by the ripples of West Lake, so there was no talk of any consciousness. Now, they have stepped onto the path of correct literary and artistic thought in one fell swoop, which is truly gratifying. Now, let's put the two issues we have seen before introducing them to the readers.</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>The first article at the beginning of "Early Sun Bi-Weekly" is "Our Words," which shows the position and attitude of "Early Sun" and is also the opening remarks that ordinary publications cannot avoid when they are published. They first make a considerable understanding of the trajectory of historical times, and then turn to the general requirements of this time.</p>
<p>Mr. Time is constantly moving forward with the earth. The trajectory of this advancement is the history of mankind. In this turbulent wave of movement, because of the pursuit of survival, mankind is constantly following the trajectory of the times and striving to improve life's creation. On the other hand, blood, life, language, writing, religion, and customs and habits also divide mankind into several groups of people with characteristics. Because of the different characteristics, although they are advancing in the same era and their purpose is to seek survival, they each form different trajectories in their methods. These peoples with distinct characteristics are nations. To study all the past, present, and future of mankind, the first step is to have a national understanding, that is, the concept of space, and the second step is to have an understanding of the times, that is, the concept of time. The intersection of this time and each space is the source of the times for each nation. Because of this relationship, the various nations reflected in literature and art also produce significant differences due to the influence of issues of interest and causality.</p>
<p>Literature and art are a part of human creation. Whether their form or substance is intentionally or unintentionally dominated by nation and time. Therefore, literature and art have their own characteristics in each nation in the horizontal aspect, and the literature and art of each nation is constantly evolving with the times in the vertical aspect. How pitiful are those who are drunk, dreaming, and transcendental theorists! Although they stop the clock and dream in an ivory tower, they do not know that the place where they breathe and live still cannot escape the palm of the nation and the times. How ridiculous and shameless are those proletarian literary theorists! They are unfortunate to have inherited the decadent and unprogressive heritage of nationality, forgotten their own nation, cannot see the characteristics of their own nation, and have become the phonograph of foreign races, insisting on destroying everything of their own nation and even defying the times, trampling their lives under the wheel of the times, opposing the nation, and drowning their souls in the spittle of the nation.</p>
<p>These are real words. No matter what kind of literary and artistic trend, there should be national factors lurking within it. As long as the promoters can be clear-headed and recognize the needs of objective conditions, remember that "the rise and fall of national literature and art are mutually causal with the prosperity and decline of national consciousness and the success of the national state," and develop the progress of literature and art, they will not fall into the crisis of decline. It is because "the desire of mankind to seek evolution promotes the birth of new literature and art." Therefore, literature and art always cannot escape the category of "seeking to adapt to national survival and improve life." This is very obvious, and the reason why Chinese literature and art in the past could not have vigorous vitality is that they mistakenly jumped into the dark side, so they have been stagnant and unable to move forward with big strides. Finally, they expressed this vision for the future of literature and art in this new era:</p>
<p>Literature is a reflection of the times. The literary movement workers of the new era are the vanguard of the times. The central text of modern China is nationalistic literature. Its mission is to awaken national consciousness, promote national development, and promote the spirit of national struggle. It is the consoler, supporter, and leader of the oppressed nations and the oppressed nations under the residual feudal forces and patriarchal forces in the attack of the Red and White empires. A great era has unfolded before us. It is hoped that all literary and artistic writers and those interested in literature and art will stand on the position of the nation to complete this great mission.</p>
<p>I believe that in this way, the scenery by the West Lake, although full of pure and beautiful atmosphere, will inevitably be somewhat turbulent. How should we pray for the realization of the sentence "It is hoped that all literary and artistic families and those interested in literature and art will stand on the position of the nation to complete this great mission"?</p>
<p>In terms of attitude, we have already seen it. Now, let's make a simple analysis of the content of these two issues.</p>
<p>Tong Mengsheng's "My View on Literature" first explains which discipline literature belongs to. From the root of mankind's pursuit of survival, we can know that science and technology are fundamentally the study of the current situation and functions of various things, and art is to guide mankind to live the kind of meaningful life they should live, but in the past, few people have said it this way. Similarly, although the issue of literature and the times has been said for a long time, the connection between the times and human life has often been overlooked by many writers. As for the author's conclusion, the view on literature is that "literature, like science, is to use a special form to convey the author's imagination and emotions with beautiful words and guide the good life of mankind in an era. The boundary of literature is to guide the good life of mankind in the middle of the times, so we must not carve in form to judge the quality of a text." This means that for a literary work, we must first consider its internal substantive expression.</p>
<p>However, it is very regrettable that in these two issues, we cannot see a complete creative work published. Wang Yang's translation of "The Painter of the Village" is the original work of Hungarian Garolony. This article does not have much meaning, but the light and easy style describes it very loosely. In terms of translation, it is not very smooth. If we purely dissect this "The Painter of the Village" from the perspective of nationalistic literature and art, I think we still need to have a deeper vision for the introduction of foreign literature.</p>
<p>In terms of poetry, these two issues occupy many pages. Originally, the expression of poetry and the explosion of emotion are the strongest, but in these few poems, the emotions belonging to poetry still lack the so-called beautiful conditions, and it seems that they should be cultivated. Bai Yun's "Early Sun" probably symbolizes "Early Sun Bi-Weekly."</p>
<p>Late at night, the stars and moon are missing,</p>
<p>Miserable fog and cold wind are also condensing.</p>
<p>All things are withering and dying,</p>
<p>Devil fires and ghost lights are extinguished from time to time.</p>
<p>At this moment,</p>
<p>The early sun is gradually rising in the east.</p>
<p>She uses a beautiful and blazing stream,</p>
<p>And affectionately illuminates all directions,</p>
<p>Saying,</p>
<p>"I have no good contribution,</p>
<p>I only have a little heat and light."</p>
<p>Overall, in terms of content, it is certainly not considered substantial, but it is barely passable. At the beginning of a movement, immaturity is inevitable. As long as we are determined to actively work hard to improve, just like "as long as there is a little heat and light," we will naturally become healthier. I hope that the authors of "Early Sun Bi-Weekly" will never be decadent, which is also very important for the expression of nationality. The so-called good reputation should still be built by ourselves. In short, in order to complete our mission, effort is the most important thing.</p>

<h3>The Art World</h3>
<h3>Su Ling on the Achievement Exhibition of the Shanghai Art College</h3>
<p>Regarding the achievement exhibition of the Shanghai Art College, five articles have been published in this art world one after another. Naturally, from what is said in these five articles, even if you have not seen the achievement exhibition, you will know that the achievements of this Shanghai Art College have already given us satisfaction. It seems that I should not say anything more here. However, two days ago, I spent an hour in that exhibition room, which was simply built and filled with the life of art, and the deep impression it gave me is still engraved in my memory. Then, I think it is not too wordy to write out a little impression and feeling in my memory.</p>
<p>Among the nearly one hundred practice achievements of the students, we can easily find that there are many works that are on the road to success. For example, Mr. Qiu Ren's nude painting has bright and warm colors, and the brushstrokes are clear and bold, and Mr. Du Shiqi's nude painting has a rich emotional and profound feeling. Mr. Zeng Zhiliang's nude painting has a solid and simple power. These are achievements that have never been seen in the achievement exhibitions of all art schools in my country in the past. The same is true for landscape paintings. Among these achievements, many have already captured the true feelings of nature and have been transformed into moving expressions. Although the use of colors and brushstrokes is often not very stable, as long as there is a long period of effort, this harvest in three years or even a shorter period of less than three years is enough to make people sigh.</p>
<p>At night, we should also look at their basic practice of sketching achievements. On this point, I cannot but sincerely advise the students of Shanghai Art College. Indeed, sketching is the basic and most important stage in the practice process of painting, and it, sketching, always occupies an important position in the efforts of an artist. Even an old writer who has created too many successful works will not leave the life of sketching. Therefore, I think that if the students of Shanghai Art College can put more effort into sketching, the achievements of oil painting production will definitely be more than this. Of course, painting can also be quite successful by relying on talent, but that always lacks reality and is easy to fail and go astray. Even this talent will become clumsy. Here, I am not saying that the students of Shanghai Art College have not done sketching practice, but I think their sketching achievements seem to lack sincere practice. Although some of the sketching achievements do recognize the function of sketching, I always hope that everyone who is engaged in art practice will never neglect the basic process of sketching. Although this process is dry and dull, you will not regret it when you make it in the future with the brushes that come out of this kind of forging. As for talent, it is a terrible thing. It can make an artist achieve accidental success. In fact, it is also a demon that leads a scholar into the path of failure.</p>
<p>I have said a lot of seemingly irrelevant things. Now I want to talk about the products of several professors.</p>
<p>This time, Mr. Chen Baoyi's few paintings are obviously more advanced than before. The colors are more cheerful, bright, and have a peaceful meaning. The brushstrokes are more sparse and lively, and what is seen is not flashy but only expresses solidity and purity. The two small landscapes are my favorite, which is like listening to the shepherd's flute under the spring sun and the stream in the autumn wind. I have always admired Mr. Chen's sketches, so in this product, I am more pleased with the sketch of Ms. Guan's portrait than with the oil painting of Ms. Guan's portrait.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Daoyuan's works have a special flavor that can give people a mysterious mood. Looking at the still life decoration of that small decoration, it seems to be whispering a little poem, and you will feel a kind of strange temptation in your heart, but the gray tone combination and strong brushstrokes of that girl's portrait bring your heart from the mysterious realm to reality.</p>
<p>Yes, it seems that in previous articles, it was said that Mr. Ni Yide's style has changed. The change of Ni's style is precisely the phenomenon of his entering the realm. Although I only found a musical instrument in this product, it was a more successful production.</p>
<p>Indeed, Ms. Guan Zilan's continuous efforts have earned her endless success. This time, she has several recent works that clearly show us a new feeling about her progress on her path of effort.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Yingpeng displayed three small old works, "Earth Mother", "Night Righteousness", and "Hou Yi Shooting the Sun." From these three small productions, it is enough to express Zhu's views on painting. In the painting part of the nationalistic literary and artistic movement, Zhu is responsible for the forerunner. In his coloring and use of brushstrokes, powerful, resolute, and profound are fully expressing the spirit of nationalism. Zhu pays attention to the ideological aspect of the content of painting, and this kind of thought is nationalistic. We hope that the production of this kind of creation can produce a large amount, radiating the glory of our nation from art to guide us to a new path of life for our nation.</p>
<p>Here, there are also several Japanese painters' products, colorful displays, Ogawa Shichigosan's small "Nude Woman" in harmony, Umehara Ryuzaburo's use of brushstrokes has a deep taste, Tatsugaya Noboru's picture is lovely, and Nakagawa Kigen's is chic and beautiful, and what I like the most is Akita Yoshikazu's landscape. This time, there is only one of his Suzhou landscapes. His brushstrokes are cheerful and vigorous, and the purple-blue tone is beautiful and quiet, with a feeling of recollection, such as listening to the sobbing of a young widow and feeling like a summer rainstorm.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to say that, in summary, the achievement exhibition of the Shanghai Art College has opened a new record for the achievements of art students in my country, and the products of the professors have shown the efforts and progress of several artists, which can be congratulated for the revitalization movement of the new art world in my country. This is what no one who has visited the achievement exhibition of the Shanghai Art College will deny.</p>
<h3>After Seeing Your Country's Art College Exhibition,</h3>
<p>A Few Words I Want to Say</p>
<p>Kotani Akikawa Saburo</p>
<p>Although I cannot hold a paintbrush, I am an art lover and admirer. I am not an art critic. What I say here is just my own impression after seeing it. I really dare not say that I am here to criticize. A few years ago, when I was in my country, whenever the Wen Zhan Er Ke Zhan and Shunyo Exhibition opened, I always ran to it early and observed every one in detail to find its true love. It has been two years since I left the country. I have come to Shanghai in your country. I am busy with company affairs all day long, and I am so busy that I can hardly even take a walk, let alone appreciate art. The night before, my wife told me that she had visited the Art College's term exhibition today, and the seven or eight exhibition rooms were really full of beautiful things. My heart, which had been extinguished for a long time, was burning again at this time. But I also thought, maybe there is nothing good to see.</p>
<p>The next day, when I drove to the Art College on Jiangwan Road, it was already two o'clock. At that time, the signing was quite crowded. After going through considerable procedures, I finally stood in Chen Liujia. The mountains and lakes on all four walls were beautiful, and my mind was completely intoxicated in the art world. There was only praise and only worship.</p>
<p>Going upstairs, I saw Chen Zhifo's powder painting and dye printing pattern, which used the ancient Egyptian figure as a material. The beauty of the composition and the harmony of the colors are really indescribable. Wang Daoyuan's "Uta-ko Statue" and "Lingyin Road" can also show his artistic depth. Chen Baoyi's portrait of Mr. K is lifelike, and the brightness of the landscape is even more rare. Ni Yide's musical instrument tea set adopts the styles of various masters in Western Europe and melts them into one furnace. You cannot achieve this wonderful realm without years of studying art. Zhu Yingpeng's Shooting the Sun uses folk stories as material and also shows its magnificent intentions. Other students can also show their personalities. Qiu Ren's Morning and Guo Weiqu's Night in Suzhou and Du Shiqi's Nude Woman show great expressive power, and the artistic talent is revealed in the paintings. It is really the future show of your country's art world. In addition, there are several paintings by my country's painters. Manya Kunihiro is a senior in my country's art world, Nakagawa Kigen is the backbone of the Er Ke Zhan, and Hasegawa Noboru is a strong member of the Shunyo Exhibition. You can also see his characteristics here. This time, Ogawa's Bridge looks like the brushstrokes are poor, so I can't help but blush for the people of the country. Because I have to examine every picture in detail, it was already dusk when I came out. After returning home, my wife asked me how I felt after seeing it, so I wrote this article to tell her, and I also hope that your editor-in-chief will publish it in the art world (thanks to Mr. Zhao Ruiwen for the translation).</p>
