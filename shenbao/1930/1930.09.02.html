<p>最近國民政府衛生部曁上海市衛生局。有管理藥商管理成藥各項規則之頒佈。以一藥典尙無之中國。乃得先有此縷析條分綱目畢具之管理規則施行。未始非政府立法羣公之宵旰勤勞。求治心切。使我儕藥業同人。得一永守勿諼之經商準則。良法美意。自無間言。惟念茲事體大。其影響實及於全國新藥業之根本。若不於作始之際。爲精密之研究。則施行一窒。糾紛必多。下旣無以爲同人恪守之良資。上亦無以宣政府提掖之美意。敝會爰於開第三次執行委員會集議時。議决特組研究管理藥商及管理成藥規則委員會。聘請新藥專家。藥學顧問等多人。悉心計論。其結果。認爲此項規則。條目雖視若周密。而要點仍難免疎漏。持論雖言之成理。而實施則多所罣礙。其癥結在於立法羣公於高瞻遠矚之餘。或未遑深考現代新藥業之情况。及未能周知各地新藥業之習慣。坐是使此項法規之本身。未能臻於十分健固之地位。而異日施行後之成效若何。或有非目前所敢想像者。充其極。或將使病家求治有方。而無藥可購。藥商有藥療人。而受制於法規。未敢出售。終於坐視病者。呻吟床第。延頸而死。是則法規所以衛民者。適足以病民。詎非失却國家立法之本意耶。敝會同人本一得之愚。竊謂中國新藥業之宜有此項法規。初無疑義。惟法規之本身。必先考慮周詳。無懈可擊。故爲今要圖。厥有三端。（一）條文之含有多量的歧義者。請當局予以具體的解釋。（二）條文之與實情相牴牾者。聲請異議。（三）條文中有所掛漏者。請予以修正及補充。且此項法規之頒佈。雖爲時已逹數月。而以上述種種之故。必須請當局展緩實施。再以一言括之。卽以商榷之精神。求法規之妥善。在法規未致妥善以前。同業如貿然註册。則將來跋疐得咎。手足無措。充其極。必至盡負國家立法之美意而后已。故請全國同業。愼行於先。作積極之堅持。一致力爭。促成政府改訂完美合法之管理規則。然後得循軌進行。前途無礙。茲敝會先就各會員之意見。呈請中央政府中央黨部行政院立法院工商部衛生部等各機關。請求對於此項法規。予以解釋。予以修正。予以補充。在此改訂期内。並請展緩執行。一方面敝會正在籌備召集全國新藥同業代表。擬請從長討論改善法規之方案。以資供獻於當局。作藥業根本上之救濟。一勞永逸。自衛卽以衛人。至於國中聞達。海内學者。更請鑒其苦衷。予以匡助。俾藥業前途。有軌則之發展。民生康健。無夭札之流行。凡在病疢。皆利賴之。又豈獨敝會區區之幸而已。謹此宣言。伏維公鑒。</p>

<h3 id="c6">附呈國民政府衛生部文 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>呈爲管理藥商管理成藥各項規則請求解釋疑義補商條文並暫緩執行事。竊念國家訂立商業法案。非採取該業專家之意旨。曁該業相沿之習慣。無由産生穩固健全之商業法規。嘗讀先總理三民主義。其主旨在乎適合現代國情及環境。其能認識國情及環境之眞相。端賴二十餘年詳察周知。加以力行之經騐。是以無論古今中外。凡創立主義。或制定法規。必以現狀爲依歸。苟悖乎此。非迂即虐。就法理而論。成文與習慣。自應並重。查吾國藥業之宜有此項管理藥商管理成藥規則。自不待言。惟。惟其規定之步驟。先須洞悉國内藥商之現狀。即國内藥商之習慣及其環境。然後酌理衡情。而加以法制。庶期令出能行。不相鑿枘。否則必致推行之際動生窒礙。究何之於事實哉。此次　鈞部所頒管理藥商及管理成藥規則。或疎密似覺失調。寛猛稍嫌失濟。跡其癓結所在。要以未能周詳藥商習慣及其環境之故。是以爲立法保持威信計。爲藥商切身利害計。立法機關應具旁求博采之虚懐。敝會同人當進知無不言之芻議。茲對於鈞部所頒各項規則。未敢隱忍奉行於先。以致引起糾紛於後。特就其間所急欲救濟者言之。約有三點。（一）條文中含有歧義者。請予以具體的解釋。（二）條文之與實情相牴牾者。聲請異議（三）條文中有所掛漏者。請予以條正及補充。茲更就三端。分别摘錄如下。（甲）請求解釋者</p>
<p>（一）如專營生物製劑製造之藥商。除任用細菌學者外。仍須照管理藥商規則第五條之規定。任用藥師或藥劑生否</p>
<p>（二）按管理藥商規則第十六十七兩條之規定。除新發明之藥品。得呈請核准發售外。其他爲藥典所不載之藥品。如「非官藥品」（Non　official　remedies）及爲現行藥典所删去之藥品。而爲醫師所賞用者。正復不少。亦在禁止之列否。</p>
<p>（三）管理成藥規則第一條第一項。關於成藥之定義。不易確認界限。如雪花膏。生髮油。菓子露等。依原文之定義將無一而非成藥。且經一醫師指示」及不經「醫師指示」之間。按之習慣。亦屬不易分别。應請明白解釋</p>
<p>（四）管理成藥規則第一條第一項第三句「不待醫師指示」之醫師二字。是否專指新醫。抑並包括中醫士。（五）毒藥第一類所載各藥。照成藥規則第八條之規定。不准摻用。然如烏頭素阿托品莨菪素士的年等。雖不准用。而其原生藥烏頭顚茄東莨菪番木龞等均有規定分量。准於摻用。倘用烏頭素等。而不超過其原生藥極量之當量。是否亦在禁止之列。</p>
<p>（乙）聲請異議者</p>
<p>（一）管理藥商第五條規定。凡西藥商必須僱用領有部證之藥師或藥劑生。查中國正式新藥商不下六千餘家。總計領有部證之藥師及藥劑生不滿六百人。但按之規定之服務程度。每一藥商所需之藥師或藥劑生。至少當在三人以上。其不敷分派明甚。然則數千家藥商。殆將同歸於盡矣。（二）管理藥商規則第七條關於麻醉及毒劇藥品之營業規定。如非醫師或醫師處方。或學術及政府機關購用。不得出售。然家庭用之臭藥水。來沙而等。農事用之殺蟲劑。如砒素。燐質等。照相術中。如定影制進用之碘。堅膜用之福馬林。加厚用之昇汞等。他如工藝必用之品。如鹽酸。硫酸。靑酸化鉀等。而由藥商出售者。何一而非毒劇之藥。今一律皆在禁止之例。殊不合營業慣例。（三）管理藥商規則第十六條規定。凡藥典記載之藥品其「性狀」「品質」「製法」俱須適合藥典標準。查各國現行藥典。祗以「性狀」「品質」爲重。於製法並不苛求限制。蓋製藥技術。日有進步。設有一藥。其「品質」「性狀」及其他學術上之需要條件。均能適合標準。正不必以藥典之規定。限制其製造技術之進展。譬如硫酸之製造。昔爲鉛空法。今爲接觸法。兩法製成之品。如純度濃度適合標準可不斤斤於製法。即如藥典製劑之製法亦未必盡合於大量製造之技術。故本條列有製法一項。殊非必要。（四）管理藥商規則第十六條。關於藥用藥品。及非供藥用的藥品。混成一起。亦屬不合商情。查非供藥用的藥品。而同名於藥典藥品者。在所不免。譬如工藝用之醋酸。其品質性狀。初不必適合藥典之規定。乃即使不供藥用。亦在不得製造賣買或貯藏之列。未免難堪也。</p>
<p>（五）管理藥商規則第十七條規定。凡新發明之藥品。非經呈請查騐。不得販賣製造或輸入。按非經查騐不得販賣可也。若謂不得「製造」「輸入」則所謂「製法」何由而知。所謂「樣品」何由而來。即此製法及樣品之呈騐早干禁例矣。</p>
<p>（六）本規則通篇稱新藥商爲西藥商。似亦未加考慮。</p>
<p>（七）管理成藥規則第十條。規定成藥所含主要藥料。必須以國文載明。此亦緩急不切實情之處。蓋將成分公開。本無何種意義。查普通服者。未必能從其所載之成分上判别藥性與效用。或增减其服量。反之其流弊則甚大。服者除構成誤解外。或且自購各藥料以不完備之技術。自行調製。豈不誤事。</p>
<p>（八）附屬管理成藥規則第八條甲之二之毒藥品目表第二類及劇藥品目表第一類所記之Maximum　dose　in　one　day</p>
<p>（一日極量）分劑輕於各國藥典。如亞砒酸其一日極量僅爲各藥典極量之三十分之一。不知有何根據。查亞砒酸雖有蓄積作用。然其重要之點。在於服法之增减與久暫。不在限量之如此輕微也。</p>
<p>（九）劇藥第一類所載藥品。其品質性狀不載明依據何國藥典。亦是缺點。查各國藥典所載同名稱之藥品。其性狀品質。未必完全相同。有時且極有高下。如藥喇叭一藥。照美藥典規定。其樹脂含量之最低限度爲七％。德藥典則爲十％。兩者相差之比。爲三十％然則照劇藥第一類之規定劇量。應有１·０土０·３之上落矣。</p>
<p>（十）毒藥第二類載有顛茄一藥。查顛茄之根與葉皆入藥。其葉之顛茄鹽基含量爲○·三％（美藥典）。根之顛茄監基含量爲○·四％（美藥典）。兩者濃度各異。且其鹽基成分。亦非盡同。用根用葉。關係甚鉅。極應明白規定。</p>
<p>（丙）修正及補充者</p>
<p>（一）爲救濟管理藥商第七條之規定。</p>
<p>（１）請於第七條第二項中規定「但已照成藥之規定及非供用之毒劇藥品不在此限。非供藥用之毒劇藥品營業規則另訂之」。</p>
<p>（２）請參照英國之「毒物及藥業法」日本之「毒物劇物營業取締規則」美國之「飲食藥物法」及「州藥律」等。準以國情。訂定藥用以外之毒劇藥品營業規則。</p>
<p>（二）關於管理藥商規則第十六條之規定請改訂如下。</p>
<p>（１）凡供藥用之藥品。其品質性狀必須適合中華民國藥典之標準。並得以「中華民國藥典標準」及P·R·C·（丨丨Pharmacopiea　of　the　epublic　of　China）等字樣記明於瓶籤上。</p>
<p>（2）中華民國藥典所記載之藥品。其性狀品質。非適合於該藥典之所定。不得以藥用目的買賣。（3）其爲中華民國藥典所不載者。以各藥所依據之外國藥典或學術團體所公認之書籍爲標準。</p>
<p>（三）關於管理藥商規則第十七條之下請加入「但治療急症之新發明藥品經醫師之採用時。不在此例。」又不得製造輸入之「製造輸入」四字請删去。</p>
<p>（四）管理成藥規則第一條第一項第三句「不待醫師之指示」下。應加入「即以治療之目的」一句。又第四句首「即」字請取消。</p>
<p>（五）管理成藥規則第十條請删去。</p>
<p>（六）兩項規則中。凡稱西藥及西藥商之處。請一律改新藥及新藥商。</p>
<p>（七）請召集醫藥團體及藥業代表。重訂毒劇藥品目表。及成藥中摻用毒劇藥之限制量。</p>
<p>綜上所列各項。其窒礙各點。彰彰明甚。其建議各點。亦爲當務之急。良以吾國有此法規。尙屬創舉。欲其完美合法。自非多次增删不可。查美國藥典第十次改正委員會會長柯克氏近作「實用藥學」一書。有言曰。「許多有見識的立法者。與事業改進家所提出之法案。就其表面觀之。似與任何一方。均無窒礙。且依若輩之見解。亦爲大有裨益者。及經精密的考慮。每有許多缺點發生。假令此項法案。成爲法規。則非獨久經確定之習慣與經營方法感受深刻之牴觸。即其所收之效果。亦將與立法之本意適相反也。是故藥團之職員及立法委員。於訂定此項法規之時。必須常自警惕。且其工作之進行。更非得藥商個人及團體的精神與實力之贊助不爲功也。」（柯氏原文從略）美國爲藥業先進之邦。殊非一藥典尙無之中國所敢望塵。尙復如此考慮周密。足證吾輩藥商對於此項管理規則之深感不安。初非無病而呻。甘爲抗命。中間不合實情。窒礙難行。及亟須修正補充之處。已如前陳。伏祈鈞部迅予召集修訂各項管理規則會議。並准敝會派員參加。在此修訂期内。及本國藥典尙未頒行之前。所有藥商註册及成藥登記等項。均請暫緩執行。實爲公便。謹呈國民政府衛生部部長鈞鑒　　上海市新藥同業公會常務委員（名略）</p>

<p>自由談付之一笑  海客　　甲—對於我的婚姻。眞的滿意極了。我妻實是一個絶頂聰明的女子。　　乙—那伊怎的肯嫁給你呢。這不是聰明常爲聰明誤麽。　　夫—我們夫婦之間。無論甚麽事情。都應公開。你要是在外有甚麽不端情事。只須欺騙我一次。我就立刻自殺。　　妻—要是兩次。便怎麽樣。　　老紳士—好孩子。你尙肯給我香一個面孔。我給你十個銅子買糖吃。　　小女郎—不要。昨天我的媽呌我吃藥。給了我二十個銅子。十個銅子有甚麽希罕。　　甲女—像密司。長得那麽醜。伊偏喜歡常照鏡子。　　乙女—你不要小覷了伊。伊眞是一個勇敢的女子。　　甲—昨夜和我妻反目。伊竟發起火來。將一個磁碟子擲在我的頭上。打了個粉碎。你看我應當怎麽辦。　　乙—我看只有一個法子。　　甲—甚麽法子。就和伊提出離婚麽。　　乙—以後多買些銅碟子。不要再買磁碟子了。漫遊雜綴  松廬寄自金閶旅次　　匝月以來。旣苦於熱。復爲文債所困。終朝埋頭書案。腦爲之脹。因屏除一切。作半月之汗漫游。旬日以還。僕僕於兩路道中。足跡所至。頗多足述。爰拾一二。以留鴻爪。　　浙省山明水麗。風景天然。而尤以諸湖勝。余此次浪游。所歷名湖凡三。即紹興之東湖。嘉興之南湖。與杭州之西湖是也。茲三湖者。各有其狀。差擬之。則西湖似美人。東湖似俠女。而南湖乃若一大家淑媛也。餘如鑑湖則似一鄉村女子。不施粉飾。太湖乃似一古刹高僧。空然無物。是則更不得不歎造物之偉大矣。　　蘇州多名園。杭州多莊墅。而嘉善則獨多烟窟。作旅善五日。得武林漁人之引導。問津者凡十有三處。且每家均有妙齡少女。以任招待。身入其境者。旣可吞雲而吐霧。又能醉月以坐花。一般意志未堅之靑年。靡不爲之神魂顛倒云。　　蓄尼之風。國府巳懸爲禁令。乃鴛鴦湖中。此風猶未稍殺。余旅浙久。每聞禾友道及該地尼庵之淫風。此番便道游禾。因往訪焉。泛舟湖心。紆行又里許。紅牆一角。即其地矣。庵門緊扃。叩之始啓。一老婦迓客入。旣而喚幼尼三數人出。年皆十六七。雖光頭僧服。丰姿殊不惡。見客。出瓜子靑荳各一具。並煑茗以奉客。余略坐片刻。即辭去。瀕行擲銀餅一枚。以代茶資。尼亦不言謝。事後詢諸土人云。昔者此間有送子庵。其中之尼。雖名妓對之猶有遜色。今已爲縣府驅逐出境矣。　　杭州之百獅池中。有巨黿。大可逾桌。傳爲宋時秦檜養以防盜者。事雖漫不可考。然確爲數百年前物也。蘇州之西園池中。亦多黿。雖不及杭産之巨。但大者亦如洗衣之盆。按該池爲放生池。此中成績。皆纍纍之善果也。吳人心慈而柔。於此可見一斑。　　凡久旅滬瀆者。輒歎海上生活程度之高。實則京中之生活程度。尤倍之。即以旅費而論。斗室單舖。須費二金。而帳也被也。皆須另資。茶也水也。亦須代價。蓋此所謂二元之租金者。舍一榻一桌外。别無長物也。故京中一宿之資。少輒四五金。長安居大不易。信可慨已。栩園隨筆  天虚我生　　近來久不作詩。前夜夢轉。忽聞蟬聲。疑已天曙。推窗外望則月色大明。擬以一二句括之苦不可得。蓋去年曾有二句云。凉月下高樹驚蟬移故枝。其景狀正同。顧亦未能續成之也昨接老友王鈍根來函。囑爲新華書局之漢宮春色一書題詞。謂其書爲許嘯天徐哲身合著。其事跡始於嬴秦。迄於西漢實取史材。無涉猥褻云云。爰作四絶以當楔子云焚書未盡笑秦皇竿木隨身又上塲却說漢宮春色好。要人借鑑看興亡。得失豈皆由馬上。荒淫多半出房中。楊雄一賦無人續。偏有而今野史公。許國曾誇大手筆。徐陵尤擅小聰明。二難三絶何緣見。四部重判王世貞。史官何似稗官尊新處都由故處温。下酒本無需别物。雲臺功罪且休論。因鈍根函云。不涉東漢事故云。應酬之作。每不愜心。惟此四首。自喜亢爽。不落窠臼。而房中馬上。竊謂天下古今。大抵如是。一部二十五史。殆可以此十四字括之。聞所未聞之笑柄  柘村　　昨赴人宴席。健談之客甚衆。皆娓娓可聽。某某君各述一事。則聞所未聞之笑柄也。轉述以博閱者一粲。　　棺材裏伸出手來　某地某年大疫。横料店（棺木舖之别稱）莫不利市三倍。日夜鳩工。趕造棺木。有孫姓人死。買棺成殮後即葬。方舉棺出門數步。棺底中段忽脫。死者一手。竟露出棺外。察之。始知棺底中段。少釘一列。殆以怱促潦草之故。且棺底過薄。旣實以重量。遂致脫開。衆怒。議多絆繩索。扛至該横料店。换厚棺重殮。以爲交涉條件。并石灰等亦責令賠償。於是人多謂「棺材裏伸出手鶆。」本爲「死要」兩字之謎語。今孫某可謂實行此語矣。蓋孫某生前。本貪得無厭之徒。今一伸手。遂換得好棺材。覺贈以此一語之尤爲確切也。　　猪壽保險費二千元　甲子兵災。某村有富室陳翁者。以現銀二千元。藏於猪圈内。掘開猪窠至最深處埋之。（積稻草灰。及他委棄穢物。塡入猪圈。名曰猪窠。農家用以肥田者。）旣而兵到。搜刮至陳氏宅。聚而煑飯。打雞鴨佐餐。又見有猪。羣謀屠之。以供大嚼。方入圈執猪。瞥見銀元。蓋猪性喜爬。主人埋銀後。猪窠略有鬆處。遂爲猪爬開。丘八見之。大喜過望。盡掘出二千元。分携而去。反無心宰猪矣。圈中二猪。性命皆保。其鄰人某。素性滑稽。語人曰。此二千元者。陳翁代兩猪所納之猪壽保險費也。獨怪翁何薄於已而厚於猪。乃如是耶。人問其故。始知陳翁嘗以其姻戚某君之言。議欲爲人壽之保險。卒以吝惜中止。故其鄰人爲此語以嘲之也。測騐記  可可　　近來游大世界歸者。每談測騐目力記憶力盛况。謂其所備美女圖花露水等贈品。可輕易飛入各人手中。小兒女慾不望大。獲之自宜欣然。而參預之者不須分文。逈異貿利。亦其受人歡迎處也。日昨薄暮無事。擊煕兒作大世界游。纔入門。煕兒即欲予導往取花露水。意若可探囊而取。可爲一笑。姑從其意。尋覓測騐所在直至四樓屋頂。見一大獅子後。人如蟻聚。即測騐處也。獅子長凡三丈有寄。作金黄色。蹲而昻首。雄偉夐絶。雙目以回光燈製成。光可遠射。所謂目光如電。洵非虚語。獅首徐徐搖轉。則目光隨即移射各處。頸間鬣毛。隨風披拂。厥嘴翕如。幾疑躍然欲起。以下而鐵籠所豢眞獅况之。誠如小　巫之見大巫。技亦神矣哉。往測騐。則首須於咫尺窗口中領取測騐單。而領單時爭攘之烈。殆可以爲一幅生活競爭圖予用盡氣力。僅乃得之。隨衆略移數步。則電光之後。有板懸焉。板界以黑綫。綫内懸物殆遍。如各種果品。各種日用品。亦有燭台衣橱面湯檯梳妝檯等具體而微若小兒玩具之物。無不爲習見之品。人人能識。然亦煞費搜羅矣。據稱每次陳物凡二十種。大小間搭啓視約一二分鐘。燈光灼然。能速記者。歷歷據所見記入。固可盡羅入紙。惟欲塡二十種無誤。則非有過人之頭腦。殆不可能。大約普通自七八種。靈敏者至十五六種。當不難如願以償。好在五種以上即有贈品。懸格不高。凡入寳山者。固不至空手回也。予與熙兒各參與二次亦均得贈。始信目光腦力尙非過劣。推以領單時不勝擁擠。適可而止。至廿種全對者。迄未見一人。據聞開始以來此次全對者。亦僅一二見而已。逡巡有頃。始如此爲九福新藥補力多之廣告。蓋目力記憶力之健全與否。在在關係於身體之强弱。而補力多爲新出壯補劑。凡目力記憶力减退而身體衰弱者。服此有非常效力。即其龐大之獅。亦所以象徵服補力多後可以有力如獅。睡獅之國。固宜以獅力之劑治之也。　　來函　逕啟者前閱貴刋。見載有署名滬濱散人之「新聞記者被騙記」一則。内述鄙人如何被李某騙取銀錢情形。閱之不勝詫異。查此事全屬子虚。當時以病在牀褥。未暇聲明爲憾。茲特專函上達。敬祈登人貴刋來函欄内。藉以補正爲荷。此致主筆先生台鑒并請撰安朱槎謹上八月二十九日英國失業工人增加之内幕（中）  黎六曾寄於巴黎　　現在英國已有許多政論記者。將各政治家所不願明言之失業人數急激增加之眞正原因。大聲道破。眞正原因如何。乃民衆對於失業救濟之濫用是。泰晤士報且公言工黨政府已因其所創立之一九三○年失業保障法案而使此不幸現象愈加顯著。使失業基金宣告破産。蓋此法案成立。失業工人獲得無限期之救濟更易。而减少其尋求工作之熱心也。對於千萬工人。接受施與已成爲一種習慣。以前並未繳欵而現在可以領得之政府救濟。已被此千萬人認爲一種應有之權利矣。　　實際。照現在規定。凡在過去不論何時。曾經繳納保險基金滿三十星期或在百零四星期（即兩年）中。曾經繳納保險基金滿八星期（即兩月）者。即有資格領取失業救濟費。而領取救濟費之工人。平素有工作時。大都所獲不多。因之領取救濟費時不免盤算工作時所獲之數目與不工作時有權領取之救濟費之數目相差幾。此相差之數目是否值得辛苦工作。盤算之結果大多以不勞而獲爲得計。　　當然。在别方面因維持衣食之實業一旦停頓。便至無法生活之大多數工人。救濟費之發給自爲必要之舉。失業工人最多之地如採炭區域與織造區域。北部及中部實業區域。因輸出不振。炭坑封閉而致失業之炭工。及因紡織範圍縮小而致半日休業或完全失業之紡織工。一時不易遷往别處以便運用其兩臂。對於此類工人領用救濟費自不能加以非難。但其救濟數目亦殊可驚。普通每採炭工人每星期所得之失業救濟費與每星期工作之酬金僅差一二先令。亦有完全相等者。是眞可謂不勞而獲之工人矣。心上温馨（二六七）  包天笑　　第十四回　翠竹淚斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離　　翠筠的晚娘。有個呌來的阿姐。。伊的名字喚做阿秀姐。。伊也是崑山人。。往來上海崑山之間。。在崑山鄉鎭間的人看來。。伊是一個漂亮人。。這時滬寗火車没有造。。航船小輪往來。。到了鄉間。伊說得上海眞似天堂樂園。。鄉下人聽得出了神。連　睡水也掛下了三尺長。。其實這位阿秀姐是做什麽生意的。。實在是一個水販媒人。。伊到吳銀匠家裏來。。看出那個呌來的妹子。。見了翠筠苗條出衆。。早已在伊的惡心脾上存記了起來。。百番在翠筠晚娘前挑唆。。加着那個時候。。吳銀匠在倒霉的當兒。。連一爿銀匠店也漸漸支持不下去了。。而且他有點懼怕這位後妻。。要是夫妻俩爭吵起來。。那個婆娘喉嚨比他響。。他也就屈服下來。。積威旣久。。事事便只好順從伊。。鄉鎭上的人。。都說吳銀匠没出息。。討了這個掃帚精進來。。一家也就完了。。那個阿秀姐好像險魂不散似的。。到了崑山。。終在轉翠筠的念頭。。知道吳銀匠近來境况不好。。家道艱難。。送點東西。。借點銀錢。。隨後提到要帶翠筠到上海去。。其實阿秀姐和翠筠的晚娘。。早已兩心相印。。在伊的晚娘。。也願意早早拔去那眼中之釘。。就只怕伊的父親不答應。到後來事機成熟。。也不怕伊父親不答應。。伊就牽着翠筠走了。。翠筠那時也不過一個十二三歲的小姑娘。。在家裏的晚娘鞭箠之下。。有什麽好處。。聽阿秀阿姨講的上海似天堂般。。當然也願意到天堂裏去觀看。。有人說。。縊死鬼討替身。。老是趁人在失意時候。。引誘人到天堂裏去。。那個天堂在那裏呢。。伊把一條帶兒做了一個圈。。像是一個月洞。。圈子裏面是仙山樓閣。。種種引人入勝。。只工你把頭鑽進圈子裏去。。連忙把帶子向你頭頸裏一收。。頃刻之間。。天堂便成了地獄。。此刻翠筠被騙到上海來。。就是這個境界。。阿秀姐就是一個討替身的縊死鬼。。做就了那個圈套。。幻出上海的種種景緻。。海市蜃樓。。不讓仙山樓閣。。你只脚踏到了黄浦江頭。。伸長了頭頸望了一望。。便好似一索子把你咽喉切住。。没有到上海時。。看是一個天堂。。騙到了上海時。。便墮入地獄。。不到幾個月。。阿秀姐便把伊賣到了堂子裏去。。名爲押賬。。一押就是十年。。好在伊和伊的晚娘通氣的。。横竪豎不是自己的骨肉。。阿秀姐稍爲分伊幾個錢。。伊巳經心滿意足的了。。</p>

<p>Recently, the National Government's Ministry of Health and the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau have promulgated various regulations for the management of drug merchants and prepared medicines. In a country like China where a pharmacopoeia does not yet exist, to have such detailed and meticulously categorized management regulations implemented is no small feat. It is the result of the government's legislative efforts and the diligent work of public officials, striving for good governance. This provides us, fellow members of the pharmaceutical industry, with a business standard to uphold and never forget. There is no doubt about the good intentions behind these well-intentioned laws. However, we are mindful that this matter is significant, and its impact will fundamentally affect the entire national new medicine industry. If we do not conduct thorough research at the outset, implementation will be hampered, and disputes will abound. Below, there will be no sound basis for colleagues to abide by, and above, there will be no way to proclaim the government's benevolent intentions. Therefore, at the third executive committee meeting, our association resolved to establish a committee to study the regulations for managing drug merchants and prepared medicines, inviting many new drug experts and pharmaceutical advisors to carefully discuss the matter. The outcome of these discussions is that, while the regulations appear comprehensive, they inevitably contain omissions in essential points. While the arguments seem reasonable, implementation is fraught with obstacles. The crux of the matter lies in the fact that the legislative officials, in their farsightedness, may not have deeply considered the situation of the modern new medicine industry and failed to fully understand the practices of the new medicine industry in various regions. This has resulted in the regulations themselves failing to reach a fully robust position. As for the effectiveness of their implementation in the future, it is difficult to imagine at present. At its extreme, it may lead to patients being unable to purchase medicine despite knowing how to seek treatment, and drug merchants having medicine to treat people but being restricted by regulations and not daring to sell it. In the end, we will sit idly by as patients groan in their beds and die waiting. In that case, the regulations meant to protect the people would instead harm them. Wouldn't that be losing the original intent of the state's legislation? Our association, with our limited understanding, believes that there is no doubt that the Chinese new medicine industry should have these regulations. However, the regulations themselves must first be thoroughly considered and flawless. Therefore, the most important plan for now is threefold: (1) For clauses containing multiple ambiguities, please ask the authorities to provide specific explanations. (2) For clauses that contradict reality, file objections. (3) For clauses that have omissions, please make revisions and supplements. Furthermore, although the promulgation of these regulations has been several months, due to the reasons mentioned above, we must ask the authorities to postpone implementation. In a word, we seek the properness of the regulations with a spirit of consultation. Before the regulations are perfected, if the industry rashly registers, they will stumble and be blamed in the future, and be at a loss. At its extreme, it will inevitably negate the good intentions of the state's legislation. Therefore, we ask all colleagues across the country to act cautiously and take proactive measures to strive together and urge the government to revise the management regulations to be perfect and legal. Only then can we proceed on the right track without hindrance in the future. Now, our association will first submit the opinions of various members to the central government, the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Health, and other agencies, requesting explanations, revisions, and supplements to these regulations. During this revision period, please also postpone implementation. On the one hand, our association is preparing to convene representatives from the national new medicine industry to discuss a plan to improve the regulations in the long term, so as to offer it to the authorities as a fundamental remedy for the pharmaceutical industry. This will be a permanent solution. Protecting ourselves is to protect others. As for the renowned figures in the country and scholars within the sea, we ask them to understand our plight and provide assistance, so that the future of the pharmaceutical industry will have a development with rules and regulations, and the people's health will be free from the spread of premature death. All those suffering from illness will benefit from it. Wouldn't that be the good fortune of our association alone? This declaration is made with reverence for public review.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Attached is a document presented to the Ministry of Health of the National Government <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Submitted for the purpose of requesting explanations for ambiguities, supplementing commercial clauses, and temporarily postponing the implementation of various regulations for the management of drug merchants and prepared medicines. We believe that the state's enactment of commercial laws, without adopting the opinions of experts in the industry and the customs that have been followed by the industry, cannot produce sound and robust commercial regulations. We have read the Three Principles of the People of the late Premier, the main purpose of which is to suit the national conditions and environment of the modern era. Its ability to recognize the truth of national conditions and the environment depends on more than twenty years of detailed observation and thorough understanding, coupled with the experience of practical implementation. Therefore, whether in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad, all those who create doctrines or formulate regulations must take the status quo as the basis. If it goes against this, it is either impractical or tyrannical. From a legal perspective, both written law and custom should be given equal importance. It goes without saying that our country's pharmaceutical industry should have these regulations for the management of drug merchants and prepared medicines. However, the steps stipulated should first thoroughly understand the current situation of domestic drug merchants, that is, the customs of domestic drug merchants and their environment, and then add legal systems with discretion and consideration. It is hoped that orders can be executed and not incompatible. Otherwise, it will inevitably lead to obstacles during the implementation process. How can it be of any use to the facts? The regulations for the management of drug merchants and prepared medicines issued by Your Ministry this time, the looseness and tightness seem to be uncoordinated, and the leniency and severity are slightly out of balance. The location of its flaws is that it has not been able to fully understand the customs and environment of drug merchants. Therefore, for the sake of maintaining the prestige of legislation and for the sake of the vital interests of drug merchants, the legislative body should have a humble attitude of seeking widely, and our colleagues should offer suggestions without reservation. Now, for the various regulations issued by Your Ministry, we dare not forbear and follow them first, so as to cause disputes later. We will specifically mention those that urgently need relief, which are roughly three points: (1) For clauses containing ambiguities, please provide specific explanations. (2) For clauses that contradict reality, file objections. (3) For clauses that have omissions, please make amendments and supplements. Now, we will extract the three points separately as follows. (A) Those requesting explanation</p>
<p>(1) If a drug merchant specializes in the manufacture of biological preparations, in addition to employing bacteriologists, must they still employ pharmacists or pharmaceutical students in accordance with Article 5 of the Regulations for the Management of Drug Merchants?</p>
<p>(2) According to Articles 16 and 17 of the Regulations for the Management of Drug Merchants, in addition to newly invented drugs that may be submitted for approval for sale, other drugs not recorded in the pharmacopoeia, such as "Non official remedies" and drugs that have been deleted from the current pharmacopoeia, but are appreciated by physicians, are quite numerous. Are they also prohibited?</p>
<p>(3) Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Management of Prepared Medicines, regarding the definition of prepared medicines, is not easy to confirm the boundary. For example, snow cream, hair growth oil, and fruit syrup, according to the definition of the original text, will all be prepared medicines. And the distinction between "on the instruction of a physician" and not "on the instruction of a physician" is also not easy to distinguish according to custom. A clear explanation should be requested.</p>
<p>(4) In Article 1, Paragraph 1, Sentence 3 of the Regulations for the Management of Prepared Medicines, "without the instruction of a physician," does the word "physician" specifically refer to new medicine doctors, or does it also include traditional Chinese medicine practitioners? (5) The various medicines listed in the first category of poisons, according to Article 8 of the Regulations for Prepared Medicines, are not allowed to be mixed. However, although aconitine, atropine, hyoscyamine, strychnine, etc. are not allowed to be used, the original medicinal materials aconite, belladonna, hyoscyamus, nux vomica, etc. have prescribed amounts and are allowed to be mixed. If aconitine, etc. are used, but do not exceed the equivalent of the maximum dose of the original medicinal material, is it also prohibited?</p>
<p>(B) Those who object</p>
<p>(1) Article 5 of the Regulations for the Management of Drug Merchants stipulates that all Western medicine merchants must employ pharmacists or pharmaceutical students who have obtained ministry certificates. It is found that there are no less than 6,000 formal new medicine merchants in China, and the total number of pharmacists and pharmaceutical students who have obtained ministry certificates is less than 600. However, according to the prescribed level of service, each drug merchant needs at least three pharmacists or pharmaceutical students. It is clear that there are not enough to allocate. Then, thousands of drug merchants will almost all perish. (2) Article 7 of the Regulations for the Management of Drug Merchants, regarding the business regulations of anesthetic and highly toxic drugs, stipulates that they shall not be sold unless purchased by a physician or a physician's prescription, or by academic and government agencies. However, household disinfectant, Lysol, etc., and insecticides for agricultural use, such as arsenic and phosphorus, etc., and iodine used in photography for fixing, formalin for hardening, and corrosive sublimate for thickening, etc., and other essential items for crafts, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, potassium cyanide, etc., which are sold by drug merchants, which one is not a highly toxic drug? Now, all of them are prohibited, which is not in line with business practice. (3) Article 16 of the Regulations for the Management of Drug Merchants stipulates that for medicines recorded in the pharmacopoeia, their "properties," "quality," and "preparation methods" must meet the standards of the pharmacopoeia. It is found that the current pharmacopoeias of various countries only emphasize "properties" and "quality," and do not strictly limit the preparation methods. Because pharmaceutical technology is progressing day by day. If a drug has "quality," "properties," and other academically required conditions that can meet the standards, there is no need to limit its manufacturing technology with the regulations of the pharmacopoeia. For example, the manufacture of sulfuric acid used to be the lead chamber method, but now it is the contact method. If the products made by the two methods have purity and concentration that meet the standards, there is no need to be meticulous about the preparation method. That is, the preparation method of the pharmacopoeia preparation may not fully meet the technology of mass production. Therefore, it is not necessary to include the item of preparation method in this article. (4) Article 16 of the Regulations for the Management of Drug Merchants, mixing pharmaceutical drugs and non-pharmaceutical drugs together is also not in line with business practice. It is inevitable that non-pharmaceutical drugs have the same name as pharmacopoeia drugs. For example, acetic acid for industrial use does not necessarily meet the regulations of the pharmacopoeia in terms of quality and properties. However, even if it is not for pharmaceutical use, it is also prohibited from manufacturing, selling, or storing, which is somewhat embarrassing.</p>
<p>(5) Article 17 of the Regulations for the Management of Drug Merchants stipulates that newly invented drugs shall not be sold, manufactured, or imported without being submitted for inspection and testing. It is acceptable not to sell without inspection and testing. But if it is said that it is not allowed to "manufacture" or "import," then how can the so-called "preparation method" be known? How can the so-called "sample" come from? That is, the submission of this preparation method and sample for testing has already violated the prohibition.</p>
<p>(6) Throughout the entire regulations, new drug merchants are referred to as Western drug merchants, which does not seem to have been considered.</p>
<p>(7) Article 10 of the Regulations for Prepared Medicines stipulates that the main medicinal materials contained in prepared medicines must be stated in Chinese. This is also an impractical place that is not urgent. There is no meaning in disclosing the ingredients. It is found that ordinary users may not be able to judge the properties and efficacy of the medicine from the ingredients listed, or increase or decrease the dosage. On the contrary, its drawbacks are very large. In addition to causing misunderstandings, users may even purchase various medicinal materials themselves and prepare them by themselves with incomplete technology. Wouldn't that be a mistake?</p>
<p>(8) Maximum dose in one day (一日極量) appended to Item 2 of Clause A of Article 8 of the Poisonous Drug List Second Category and the Severely Toxic Drug List First Category of the Subsidiary Regulations for the Management of Prepared Medicines is lighter than the pharmacopoeias of various countries. For example, the maximum daily dose of arsenic acid is only one-thirtieth of the maximum dose of various pharmacopoeias. I don't know what the basis is. Although arsenic acid has a cumulative effect, its important point lies in the increase or decrease and duration of the dose, not in limiting it so slightly.</p>
<p>(9) For the drugs listed in the first category of severely toxic drugs, it is also a shortcoming that their quality and properties are not stated according to which country's pharmacopoeia. It is found that the properties and quality of drugs with the same name listed in the pharmacopoeias of various countries are not necessarily completely the same. Sometimes, there are also very high and low points. For example, for the drug ipecac, according to the United States Pharmacopoeia, the minimum limit of its resin content is 7%. The German Pharmacopoeia is 10%. The ratio of the difference between the two is 30%. Then, according to the regulation of the first category of severely toxic drugs, the severe dose should be 1.0 ± 0.3.</p>
<p>(10) The second category of poisons contains the drug belladonna. It is found that both the root and leaves of belladonna are used as medicine. The belladonna base content of its leaves is 0.3% (United States Pharmacopoeia). The belladonna base content of the root is 0.4% (United States Pharmacopoeia). The concentrations of the two are different, and their base components are not entirely the same. The use of roots and leaves is very important and should be clearly stated.</p>
<p>(C) Amendments and supplements</p>
<p>(1) To remedy the provisions of Article 7 of the Regulations for the Management of Drug Merchants.</p>
<p>(1) Please stipulate in Article 7, Paragraph 2, "However, this is not the case for highly toxic drugs that have been processed in accordance with the regulations for prepared medicines and are not for use. Separate operating regulations for highly toxic drugs not for pharmaceutical use will be formulated."</p>
<p>(2) Please refer to the United Kingdom's "Poisons and Pharmacy Act," Japan's "Regulations for the Control of the Operation of Poisonous and Deleterious Substances," the United States' "Food and Drug Act," and "State Pharmacy Laws," etc., and formulate operating regulations for highly toxic drugs other than for pharmaceutical use based on national conditions.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the provisions of Article 16 of the Regulations for the Management of Drug Merchants, please revise as follows.</p>
<p>(1) The quality and properties of all drugs for pharmaceutical use must meet the standards of the Pharmacopoeia of the Republic of China, and the words "Standards of the Pharmacopoeia of the Republic of China" and P.R.C. (丨丨Pharmacopiea of the Republic of China) may be marked on the bottle label.</p>
<p>(2) Drugs recorded in the Pharmacopoeia of the Republic of China, whose properties and quality do not meet the standards set by the pharmacopoeia, shall not be bought or sold for pharmaceutical purposes. (3) Those not recorded in the Pharmacopoeia of the Republic of China shall be based on the foreign pharmacopoeia or books recognized by academic organizations on which each drug is based.</p>
<p>(3) Please add "However, this is not the case for newly invented drugs for the treatment of acute diseases that have been adopted by physicians" under Article 17 of the Regulations for the Management of Drug Merchants. Also, please delete the four words "manufacture and import" that are not allowed to be manufactured and imported.</p>
<p>(4) Under Article 1, Paragraph 1, Sentence 3 of the Regulations for Prepared Medicines, "without the instruction of a physician," the phrase "for the purpose of treatment" should be added. Also, please remove the word "that" at the beginning of the fourth sentence.</p>
<p>(5) Please delete Article 10 of the Regulations for Prepared Medicines.</p>
<p>(6) In both sets of regulations, please change all references to Western medicine and Western drug merchants to new medicine and new drug merchants.</p>
<p>(7) Please convene medical and pharmaceutical groups and pharmaceutical industry representatives to re-determine the list of highly toxic drugs and the limits for the addition of highly toxic drugs in prepared medicines.</p>
<p>In summary, the various points listed above, the various obstacles, are very obvious. The various suggestions are also the top priority. Because our country has these regulations, it is still a pioneering undertaking. If we want it to be perfect and legal, it must be amended and deleted many times. Mr. Coke, the chairman of the Tenth Revision Committee of the American Pharmacopoeia, said in his recent book "Practical Pharmacy," "Many bills put forward by insightful legislators and business improvers, on the surface, do not seem to have any obstacles to any party. And according to the views of these people, they are also very beneficial. After careful consideration, many shortcomings occur. If this bill becomes a regulation, it will not only have a profound conflict with long-established habits and business methods, but also the effect it achieves will be the opposite of the original intention of the legislation. Therefore, the officers of the pharmaceutical group and the legislators must always be vigilant when formulating this regulation, and the progress of their work cannot be successful without the support of the spirit and strength of individual drug merchants and groups." (Mr. Coke's original text is omitted) The United States is an advanced country in the pharmaceutical industry, far from being comparable to China, which does not yet have a pharmacopoeia. It is still so carefully considered, which proves that our drug merchants feel deeply uneasy about these management regulations. It is not groaning without illness and willingly disobeying orders. The intermediate places that do not conform to the actual situation, are difficult to implement, and urgently need to be amended and supplemented have been stated above. We respectfully request Your Ministry to quickly convene a meeting to revise the various management regulations, and allow our association to send representatives to participate. During this revision period, and before the national pharmacopoeia has been promulgated, all items such as drug merchant registration and prepared medicine registration should be temporarily postponed. It is really convenient for the public. Respectfully presented to the Minister of the Ministry of Health of the National Government. Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai New Medicine Trade Association (names omitted)</p>

<p>Advancing Towards Lanfeng</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Second Division of the Training Corps telegraphed from Minquan County on the 31st that the division captured Minquan County City at dawn on the 31st and is now advancing towards Lanfeng in fierce pursuit, which can be taken within a day. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Second Division of the Training Corps launched a general offensive on the 29th and 30th. The enemy troops resisted desperately but were defeated. The division occupied Minquan County on the morning of the 31st and captured a large number of enemy firearms. The division is now dispatching teams to pursue. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military news: The Central Army launched a general offensive on the 1st on the front line of the Longhai Railway, on both the left and right wings. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government, according to a telegram from the General Staff Office of the Train Headquarters, stated that on the Longhai front, the rebel troops of Yan and Feng relied on the defense lines they had built and stubbornly resisted, hindering the advance of our large army for more than a month. Since the pacification of the Lu border, our large army has gathered on the Longhai front, and morale is high. For days, the entire line has been launching fierce attacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the rebel enemy. More than half of those killed in various areas have died, and the elite troops have been lost, and the rebel atmosphere has dissipated. On the 29th, the order for a general offensive was issued. Our soldiers bravely fought and took the lead, breaking through various important fortresses one after another. The enemy troops had no dangerous place to rely on and collapsed and fled in disorder. Our army tracked them down and inflicted heavy blows. The enemy's several defense lines were completely lost and had no time to stop. On the morning of the 30th, the troops on our right flank had crossed Kaocheng Hongmiao and approached Lanfeng. The troops on the central route had also crossed Yejigang and reached Yifeng Shuangcui Jitai Chen Sai Guolou Line to the west of Neihuang. The columns on our left flank had also advanced to Gaoxianji Touduankou and other places. All are now in the process of pursuing at full speed, with corpses lying all along the way. The enemy abandoned a large amount of military supplies and equipment. It is estimated that more than 2,700 officers and soldiers, more than 3,000 rifles and carbines, more than ten field mountain guns, and more than thirty heavy mortars and more than twenty machine guns have been captured. Since this heavy blow, the collapse is beyond salvation, and there is no time to save the dead. The day when the army washes its armor is near at hand. I respectfully announce the victory first. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gao Lingbai, Secretary of the National Government, telegraphed Gu Yingfen from the front line on the 1st, saying that the enemy troops on the front line of the Longhai Railway had collapsed the night before, and our army was intercepting them.

<p>(Nanjing) Yanzhou telegram: Inspectors Jing and Zhang Jichun of the Xuzhou Camp and the Xuzhou reporter group went to Qufu from Yanzhou on the morning of the 31st to inspect the post-war situation and represent condolences. After the war, Qufu has been comforted by Commander-in-Chief Chiang's appropriation of funds, but the Confucius Temple, Yan Temple, city walls, and houses that were bombed have not yet been repaired. After the inspection, they went to the Sacred Duke Temple to visit Duke Yansheng Kong Decheng, who is only eleven years old. His clansman Kong Lianfang represented him and spoke, denouncing the cruelty of the Jin army in bombing the sacred sites with artillery. Later, they went to the Confucius Forest to inspect. The forest guard said that when the Jin army attacked the city, they occupied the area around the Confucius Forest and set up artillery on the Second Gate Tower to shoot at the city. The forest is in the northeast corner of the city, and the Yan Temple has been hit by many shells. The east, west, and north sides of the city all have battle trenches built by the Jin army, less than a mile away from the city. There are also abandoned corpses of fallen officers and soldiers near the battle trenches. There are many corpses of rebels. Several battle trenches can also be seen on the Qu-Yan road, which have not yet been leveled. In the Confucius Temple, there are posters praying for the speedy death of the bandits Yan and Feng by the people of the north, and praying for the success of Sun Zhongshan Zhongzheng. The psychology of the people of Qu can be seen. After the inspection, they returned to Yanzhou that evening and planned to go to Taian for inspection on the 1st. (1st Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Military News: (1) Sun Liangcheng dispatched a unit on the evening of the 31st to sneak attack Suixian County, feinting east and attacking west. Mao's army was aware of the trick and secretly dispatched a regiment to抄 sneak around the sneaking troops and violently shoot them with machine guns. Sun's rebels were unprepared and suffered many casualties. Most of the soldiers who failed to escape were captured. The remaining enemies fled towards Qixian County and are now being pursued. (2) Our Xu Kexiang's division had already defeated the remnants of Zhou Dai's troops on the north bank of Luokou on the evening of the 29th and captured a large number of them. (3) The Ping-Han battle, which had been silent for a long time, has had no changes in its formation in the past three weeks. The frontline troops of both the enemy and ourselves have recently been redeployed in the past three days. The main force on our frontline has suddenly increased by more than double, and the formation has been expanded into a situation that is about to break out. (4) The enemies on the front lines of the Longhai and Ping-Han lines have completely changed their strategy, shrinking their lines of defense. Their main force has been transferred and retreated to defend the Long and Ping lines. The Chenliu-Tongxu-Weishi area has become a horizontal connecting line, forming the most solid defense. Lanfeng-Xuchang relies on artillery for protection and does not have heavy troops stationed. It seems that there is an intention to abandon it. (1st Dispatch)</p>

The Zhu and Huang factions have already approached, and there have been engagements last night and this morning, resulting in over 200 communist casualties and over 1,000 wounded. I intend to wait for their exhaustion and then launch a full-scale, fierce assault to annihilate them in one fell swoop. (2) The mountain ranges of Liuyang and Pingxiang make combat difficult, so I am waiting for the bandits to leave the bandit area to eliminate their main force.

<h3 id="e12">Portuguese Colonies Demand Autonomy <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Today's world finds that the countries that possess the most colonies are the most difficult to govern. As the tide of national movements fiercely develops, military force is insufficient to deter, and kindness is insufficient to influence. There are no methods to maintain the yoke of control, so the countries governing these territories, even if they are slightly negligent, will immediately face unrest. Among the major European powers, other than Britain and Spain, Portugal has the most extensive colonies. The Portuguese colonies in Africa are even larger than those in Asia, and have rich production. Today's methods of governing colonies are nothing more than improving agriculture, industry, and commerce to absorb products, and maintaining political order to keep the people peaceful and without causing trouble. The Portuguese government has also issued orders to reorganize and reform its administrative system, subsidize its annual expenses, and encourage its agriculture and industry. However, the Portuguese government's assistance is limited, so there are no visible achievements. Moreover, because most of its colonies are located along the coast, Portugal places the greatest emphasis on maintaining its naval power, believing that without it, it would be impossible to suppress everything. As a result, its emotional ties with its colonies are not very close. Moreover, the Portuguese government itself has recently been unstable. This is why the People's Party in Angola and other African colonies has risen up to demand autonomy. Although, in the current situation of national movements, no country can avoid this, and once the movement starts, no country can easily eliminate it. Britain's experience can be used as a lesson. Furthermore, the demands of the African colonies are only for the organization of a federation, which is also a political system that adapts to the current trend and is not absolutely disadvantageous to the Portuguese government. It is unknown how the Portuguese government will respond.</p>

<p>German Remarks Arouse Resentment</p>
<p>Firmly Refuse to Give Up Western Territory</p>
<p>Reuters Warsaw, 31st -- At a celebration held in Berlin on August 10, Dr. Treviranus, a former official in the German-occupied territories, spoke of the Eastern Territory issue, saying that the division of the land east of the Vistula River to Poland was a heavy blow to Germany's eastern flank. Poland's future could only be guaranteed if the borders between Poland and Germany were no longer unjust and were no longer in a state of unrest, and that we cannot but resent seeing the land that has been lost, but one day it will be taken back, and a war for justice will eventually break out to liberate Germany and Europe. These remarks aroused considerable resentment among the Polish people. At the Citizens' United Congress held today, ten thousand participants discussed Dr. Treviranus's remarks and passed a resolution condemning his demand to seize Polish territory, and declared that Poland would never allow an inch to be given up. A delegation was then sent to visit Foreign Minister Zaleski with the resolution. Zaleski replied that the Polish government would never allow Polish rights to be infringed upon.</p>
<p>National News Agency Warsaw, 31st -- Even though Piłsudski's appointment as prime minister knew that the Polish parliament would soon be dissolved, yesterday's sudden order was unexpected by the opposition party. The opposition is pessimistic about the new elections, and its leaders believe that the government will disregard everything and use extraordinary means to crack down on the opposition's financial resources and restrict freedom of election. The government hopes to use the imagined terror of the Germans to divert national attention and make the people support the dictatorship system. The civic congress convened in the theater square tonight is also used for this purpose, and the large-scale search of Ukrainian political propagandists a few days ago had the same intention. However, Piłsudski is not solely responsible for creating this kind of situation in Polish politics. The opposition party should also share the blame. The members of the opposition have never dared to genuinely and forcefully resist the actions of the military faction, and only like to make grandiose statements, but when they are subjected to a little pressure, they are as silent as cicadas, so they are despised by Piłsudski along with the Congress and the constitutional government.</p>

Later, the Prime Minister told people that the wind and rain were extremely heavy that day and lasted for several hours. If he had been half an hour later in the sky, he might have died.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Reasons for the Secret President's Detention <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Accumulating Wealth and Enriching Himself During His Tenure</p>
<p>The People Hold a Deep-Seated Grudge</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 31st - According to travelers returning from Peru, the reason the deposed president of Peru was detained by the revolutionary party is that he is rumored to have a huge sum of 25.5 million pounds deposited in a British bank. The Peruvian people deeply resent the deposed president and others for accumulating wealth and enriching themselves. Therefore, they destroyed his residence in the capital and burned his valuable furniture to the ground.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 31st - A telegram from Peru states that the new government is now dismantling the Peruvian diplomatic service. The resignations of the envoys stationed in London, Spain, Vienna, and Beijing have been approved. It is said that the envoy and consul-general stationed in France have been replaced, and the envoy stationed in Paris has been ordered to return home for inspection.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Lima, 31st - The new Peruvian government has declared that it guarantees to abolish all monopolies within the country, revise all financial treaties concluded with foreign governments and merchants, and temporarily suspend the provisions in the constitution regarding the special status of officials, in order to prosecute certain corrupt officials who accepted bribes during the La Guia's tenure in court. All the senior officials during the former president's tenure have actually been dismissed, and even the envoys stationed in France, Belgium, England, Spain, and Austria will be replaced. However, the envoys stationed in the United States and the representatives to the Holy See have successively submitted their resignations, but none of them have been approved. In addition to replacing one representative, the remaining members of the delegation to the League of Nations have all been reappointed. Currently, great attention is being paid here to the repercussions of the Peruvian revolution on various South American countries. It is reported that political unrest has occurred in Guatemala, and the cabinet has resigned en masse, but the president has only approved the departure of a few cabinet members. It is feared that the turmoil has not yet subsided. Although no further disturbances or public security incidents have occurred in the capital of Argentina since yesterday's bloody tragedy, the situation remains extremely tense, and the strictness of the alert makes the entire city almost a large military camp.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Memorial Week of the Central Government and National Government <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters, 1st, 9:00 AM - The Central Party Headquarters held its 75th weekly memorial service for the Premier. Central Committee members Hu Hanmin, Chen Guofu, Enhebatu, Chen Lifu, Miao Peicheng, and others, as well as approximately 500 staff members of the headquarters, attended. Chairman Hu Hanmin presided over the ceremony. After the ceremony, the chairman's report briefly stated that the Central Government has achieved a complete victory in the recent military situation. The Yan army has been disastrously defeated and cannot be reorganized, and the Feng army has also suffered repeated blows and is on the verge of collapse. As for the false expanded meeting, the Central Government's aircraft only inspected Peiping once and dropped a few bombs, causing those people to panic. Feng's only way to avoid danger is to dig earth caves, but even if they dig into the caves, they still cannot last long. Since Yan is unable to maintain the situation in the north, he still hopes that Feng can come to Peiping, but Feng is afraid of conflict with Liaoning and dares not go north. Now, the Liaoning army has already been dispatched, and the Yan army is already unable to fight. Even if the Feng army retreats, there is still only one path to Shaanxi and Gansu, but the land in Shaanxi and Gansu is barren and the people are poor, unable to support a large number of troops. Moreover, Feng has greatly lost the morale of the army. If he withdraws to Shaanxi and Gansu, many officers and soldiers will not be willing to follow. Many officers and soldiers under Yan and Feng are discerning and know what is in their best interest. Comrade Chiang Kai-shek recently issued a declaration urging Yan and Feng's subordinates to defect to the Central Government, which will still be treated favorably. Originally, this campaign against the rebels was only to eliminate their leaders, and those who were coerced would be treated leniently. If the military personnel in the north are awakened, the war will not be difficult to end soon. Yan Xishan has been cunning all his life, always setting people up. This time, he himself has been set up. Feng Yuxiang has been fickle all his life, and the result is also that he cannot succeed. However, the Central Government has also been greatly affected. Matters that should be carried out in domestic affairs and diplomacy cannot be promoted due to the war. However, comrades must still work extra hard on matters that can be promoted and must not blame the military situation and let them stagnate. We must also blame and encourage ourselves. As the saying goes, "Many hardships build a nation." A newly emerging nation must have all kinds of hardships and difficulties, which is also the historical process of ancient and modern China and foreign countries. Now that the military situation is about to end, we can be very optimistic about the future. However, it is regrettable that Wang Jingwei abandoned his revolutionary position this time and cooperated with reactionary warlords. In terms of writing and career, Wang is still a good revolutionary, so why did he fail to such an extent? We must study the reasons for this. In a word, it is because he lacks purpose and unwavering faith. Therefore, he can cooperate with the government faction one moment, the Communist Party the next, and then reactionary warlords. His repeated changes of purpose are like Liang Qichao, who was able to become famous for his articles but whose political views could not be valued by the world. This has to be regretted for Wang. The Premier's will says to continue efforts and carry through to the end. Wang Jingwei has now left the revolution and entered reaction. The continuity of the revolution has been lost, and there is no point in talking about efforts. Revolution cannot even talk about carrying through the revolution to the end. The Premier divided the construction into three periods: military administration, tutelage administration, and constitutional administration. The order in this process contains great significance. The United States and France are both revolutions, but the difference between order and chaos is determined by whether they have undergone the revolutionary training process or not. The Premier attached more importance to the period of tutelage administration than to the periods of military administration and constitutional administration, because the success or failure of political construction depends on whether the scale is created well during the period of tutelage administration. The Premier said that all human actions cannot be separated from faith for a day. Without faith, there is no doctrine. Wang Jingwei's problem is that he has no faith. If you compare his articles before and after, you can see that he has no doctrine. Therefore, he can only become a writer and cannot become a politician. The Premier's learning is all-encompassing. Without science, there is no way to revitalize the cause. Without philosophy, there is no way to set people's hearts right. Therefore, the Premier wants to mention science and philosophy together. He once said that in the university, rectifying the heart, making the will sincere, cultivating the person, regulating the family, governing the state, and pacifying the world are the great foundation of a person's life, which is also the great foundation of politics. It can be seen that the success of the Premier's great cause is all due to the four words "rectifying the heart and making the will sincere." The reason why the reactionaries ultimately failed is actually just one word: "false." This is why we must constantly remind ourselves to be honest in everything we do. As for the selection of talents, the examination system has now been adopted, but examining officials is different from examining students. The Premier once said that examining a cook is to test his ability to cook and season, and examining a chauffeur is to test his ability to drive. If people are selected based on their articles, then their talents will not match their positions. Therefore, when examining officials, the focus should be on whether they are competent for their positions. When examining students, the focus should be on whether they are capable of learning. It is not possible to stick to one rule but should be based on the situation and the talent. Recently, there have been many cases of non-cooperation in the lower-level party and government organs, all because one party adheres to theory and the other values ​​reality, and they cannot integrate with each other. Thinking of this, I hope that those who work in the lower-level party and government organs must pay attention to cooperation in the future. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>National Government, 1st, 10:00 AM - The National Government held a memorial week. Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Wang Zhengting, Yi Peiji, Zhu Peide, Jiao Yitang, Jiang Menglin, Liu Ruiheng, Zhang Nanxian, Lin Xiang, Zheng Hongnian, Chen Shaokuan, Zhou Yawei, Mu Xiangyue, Zhong Ketuo, Zhu Jingnong, Chen Yu, Yi Ao, Chen Wohua, Wu Siyu, Zhang Xiqian, and others, as well as more than 200 staff members from the two departments of the National Government's civil affairs and military affairs, attended. Chairman Tan Yankai presided over the ceremony. Secretary Qian Changzhao gave a political report as follows: "The State Council approved the two protocols on the revision of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice and the United States' accession to the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice last Friday. The Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice was formulated in 1920 and began to perform its duties in 1922. After seven years of experience, countries believe that the content of the Statute needs to be revised. This year is the period for the complete re-election of the court's personnel, and the revision of the Statute must be prepared as soon as possible. Therefore, the review and revision have been carried out since 1928. The new protocol was signed by representatives of various countries on September 14, 1929, and sent to various countries for approval. However, the period for the complete re-election of the court's personnel is September of this year, which is very short. The approval procedures of various countries may not necessarily be completed in full. Therefore, Article 4 of the new protocol stipulates that if the Executive Council of the League of Nations is aware that members of the League of Nations who have approved the protocol of December 16, 1920, and the countries listed in the Annex to the Covenant, although they have not yet submitted the documents of approval of this protocol, do not object to the entry into force of the revised text of the court's Statute attached to this protocol, then this protocol shall enter into force on September 1, 1930." Now I will talk about the content of the revision of the Statute. There are many articles revised this time, and the important points are: 1. Regarding the increase in the number of court sessions and the extension of court terms; 2. Regarding the changes in the organization and duties of court personnel, as well as their treatment; 3. Regarding the increase, decrease, or change of other items. In addition, a new chapter has been established to regulate the authority of consultation, which can be studied separately. (1) Regarding the increase in the number of court sessions and the extension of court terms, the 1920 regulations stipulated that the court should hold one session per year, and its term should be from June 15 until all cases submitted for trial are concluded. The president may convene court personnel to hold sessions temporarily when necessary. In fact, there have been eight temporary sessions in the past seven years, which is more than the regular court sessions. The court terms are also very long. In order to adapt to the facts, Article 23 has been revised this time to state that "the court shall hold sessions regularly except for judicial holidays. The date and duration of the holidays shall be determined by the court itself. Court personnel whose residences are more than five days' ordinary journey away from The Hague may apply for six months' leave every three years in addition to judicial holidays and may deduct the days spent in transit. Court personnel must be at the disposal of the court at all times, except for regular leave or if they are unable to attend court due to illness or other reasons after informing the president." (2) Regarding the changes in the organization and duties of court personnel, as well as their treatment, the 1920 regulations stipulated that the court should be organized with 15 people, 11 regular members and 4 alternate members. At that time, the legislators believed that there was a big difference between the duties of regular members and alternate members who were occasionally called to court. Therefore, regular members were bound by the conditions of not holding concurrent positions, while alternate members could continue to engage in other duties. However, in the past seven years, the difference in duties between regular members and alternate members has completely disappeared. Alternate members attend court as frequently as regular members, and their status is not subject to the restrictions of not holding concurrent positions, which is more favorable than regular members. Therefore, the distinction between regular and alternate members has been abolished this time. The new Article 3 states that "the court shall consist of 15 people." As for the conditions of not holding concurrent positions, they have also been further restricted. The new Article 16 states that "court personnel may not exercise political or administrative functions and may not engage in other occupations." Let's talk about treatment again. The 1920 regulations stipulated that court personnel should receive an annual salary, with special allowances during their term of service. This time, it has become a simple regulation that all court personnel receive a fixed annual salary regardless of their term of service, which is more favorable than before in various ways. (3) Regarding the increase, decrease, or change of other items, important ones include the election and financial responsibility of countries that have signed the protocol but are not members of the League of Nations. There was no explicit provision for this in the past, but this time it has been stipulated. There was also no explicit provision for the resignation of legal personnel in the past, but this time it has also been stipulated. Others, such as promoting summary courts and allowing the use of languages ​​other than English and French in court at the request of either party to the case, etc. The above are all revisions to the articles. The new chapter in the Statute regulates the authority of consultation, which is also very important. There was no explicit provision for this in 1920. Although some scholars believe that the jurisdiction of the court as stated in Article 36 already includes the authority of consultation, it is more appropriate to stipulate the consultation procedure in the Statute. The new chapter has four articles and is quite comprehensive. In short, the Statute revised this time does not fundamentally create anything in the Statute but only revises or supplements the places that must be changed or supplemented based on the experience gained in the past seven years. All the articles are still considered appropriate, and our country has already approved its protocol. At the same time, the United States' accession to the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice protocol, although its Article 1 recognizes the five reservations of the United States, and Articles 2, 3, 4, and 5, etc., have restricted the rights of the signing countries on the five reservations, which does not hinder them, so it is approved together."</p>
<h3 id="e70">Chen Jitang Returns to Guangdong <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication - Since the Yunnan army joined the war in Guizhou province, Lu Han's and Zhang Chong's troops are besieging Nanning. However, due to the terrain, they have not yet entered the city. The Eighth Route Army has transferred troops from the Fuhe area to Dahe, while Zhaoping, Majiang, and Limugen in the Fuhe area are temporarily taking a defensive posture. It has been learned that the Eighth Route Army going to Dahe includes two divisions, one brigade, and three independent regiments, which will assist the Yunnan army in attacking the enemy, naturally increasing their prestige considerably. After the various divisions concentrated in Dahe, they issued a general offensive order on the 25th, with the Yunnan army responsible for besieging Yongyuan and monitoring the enemy's retreat. After the general offensive order was issued, the Yu division occupied the enemy in Shilong, Laibin, and Binyang, who did not dare to escape to Liuzhou and turned to Nanning. Therefore, the Yu division of the Eighth Route Army occupied Binyang at 9:00 AM on the 26th. With Binyang captured, the enemy's communication with Liuzhou has been cut off, and the fall of Nanning is no longer a problem. In the future, the plan is to attack Liuzhou. Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route Army, took advantage of the success of the military operations in the front to return to Guangdong and negotiate with the authorities on the post-war plans for Guizhou province. On the morning of the 27th, Chen accompanied Deng Hui, the third section chief of the headquarters' staff office, adjutant Huang Tingxiang, advisor Chen Gong, and Yunnan representative Lu Yafu, among others, from Wuzhou on the Zhixin warship, setting sail at 5:30 AM and arriving at Sanshui Kouhe in the afternoon. Upon receiving the news, the provincial capital's military and police authorities immediately ordered the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway Bureau to prepare a special train to wait at Kouhe and sent military police detectives to protect the Shiweitang station. At 2:00 PM, the heads of military and political organs arrived at the station one after another to welcome them. The Zhixin ship arrived at Kouhe at 4:00 PM that afternoon. Chen Jitang and others then transferred to a special train to the province. At 5:20 PM, the special train arrived at the destination. After getting off the train, they shook hands with each of the welcomers and walked out of the station, taking an electric wheel to land on the Huangsha embankment and returning directly to their residence in Dongshan by car. That evening, all the officials visited and inquired. According to Chen, the Eighth Route Army's separate attacks on Liuzhou and Nanning would first attack Binyang to cut off the enemy's communication between Liuzhou and Yongzhou. Binyang was indeed captured by the Yu division on the morning of the 26th, and the enemy is no longer a problem. Currently, the Eighth Route Army is still transferring a part of the army to cooperate with the Yunnan army in besieging Nanning. Once Nanning is taken, Guizhou province can be stabilized. The remaining enemies are now scattered in Liuzhou and Guilin, with little remaining strength, and it is easy to eliminate them. (August 28)</p>

<h3 id="e72">Crowds Gather in Beidaihe <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Beidaihe Communication - Since the Jin army abandoned Jinan and retreated to Hebei, the overall situation has suddenly changed. Crowds have gathered in Beidaihe, which has become the center of the current situation, and Zhang Xueliang has become an influential figure. In order to provide readers with accurate news, the reporter took a train from Tianjin at 11:50 PM on August 24. This was the first day that the Beining Railway was restored to traffic after being damaged by floods. The passengers were very crowded, and there was almost no room to set foot in the second and third class carriages. At 2:00 AM (that is, the morning of the 25th), the train passed Lutai, and a sudden thunderstorm, gale, and rain brought hail, which lasted for about 20 minutes. At 5:20, the train passed Luanzhou, which was still being inspected by the Jin army. No trace of the Northeast Army was seen. The flood in the Luan River had receded. Crossing the river belonged to Changli County, which was the defense area of the Northeast Army. At 6:30, the track north of the 65th road house at Liushouying was washed away by water for 500 meters, and the deep pit was 27 feet deep. 14 train cars of stones had not yet filled the pit. Although traffic was restored today, this place was still supported by railroad ties, and the train slowly passed. At 7:30, the train arrived in Beidaihe. Changed trains to the Haikou Station and stayed at the Dongshan Hotel. Then went to the Tongfu Hotel in Xishan to visit Kong Fanwei, the representative of Yan Xishan. According to him, he was the representative stationed in Liaoning. On the 15th, because the Third Route Army was defeated in Jinan, he accompanied Feng Yuxiang's representative stationed in Liaoning, Men Zhizhong, to Dalian to visit Sun Xinyuan (that is, Sun Chuanfang). After arriving in Dalian, he heard rumors of the Shanhaiguan mutiny. On the 17th, he and Sun went to Tianjin. After arriving in Tianjin, he heard rumors of Zhang Xueliang's assassination, so they came to Beidaihe together. The purpose was only to express condolences. Unexpectedly, representatives of the expanded conference, such as Guo Taiqi, Chen Gongbo, and Qin Liming, and the representatives of the Second Route Army Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi, Jia Jingde, and Xue Dubi of the Second and Third Route Armies arrived one after another. The quiet beach suddenly became active. Before Yin Mouyi of the 23rd Brigade Commander of the Northeast Army, Ma Tingfu, moved, he was in the Tongfu Hotel all day long with Tao Dunli, etc., swallowing clouds and spitting fog, spending money like dirt, which has already caused people to suspect. Then, after the Shanhaiguan Guard</p>
<h3 id="e73">The Tongfu Hotel in Beidaihe <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Ma Tingfu, Tao Dunli, etc., were all arrested here</p>
<p>Route Commander Yu Xuezhong obtained evidence of the Ma brigade's abnormal movements and secretly reported to Zhang. Zhang did not reveal his emotions and immediately arrested and monitored Ma, Tao, and Zheng Zesheng, the commander of the Northeast Cavalry Division, in special cars and the Public Security Bureau. At that time, Ma Brigade had a regiment of infantry stationed between Liushouying and Beidaihe, and most of the Qin-Shanhaiguan was gathered in Ma Brigade. Zhang's ability to handle it with ease, not being alarmed, and his amazing methods are truly admirable. The Chinese and foreign people living on the seaside did not know about the mutiny until they read the reports in the Pingjin newspapers. After Zheng Zesheng was monitored, he became anxious and suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. After being diagnosed and treated by the Lianfeng Hospital, it was ineffective. He died on the 22nd. A memorial service was held on the 24th, and the coffin was sent back to his hometown for burial on the 25th. Southern representatives Fang Benren, Wu Tiecheng, and Zhang Qun all lived in the Tongfu Hotel. The northern and southern representatives met from time to time, but they never talked about state affairs. After all, everyone was an acquaintance, but they were in different positions. Personal meetings were still friendly, and there were no grudges. Then, I visited Qin Liming. According to him, he arrived here on the 22nd and met with Zhang Xueliang at 10:00 PM on the 24th. Guo Taiqi and Chen Gongbo were both present. The conversation ended at 3:00 AM on the 25th, and it was decided to return to Ping by car with Guo Taiqi on the 26th night. Speaking of this, Xue Dubi also came and said to the reporter that he had talked with Zhang Xueliang several times, and the task had been completed. The scenery here is beautiful, and he plans to stay for a few days and then return to Ping with Jia Jingde. Fu Zuoyi lives in a certain residence in Xishan Park, and his chief of staff, Zhu Xizhang, lives in the Biji Hotel. As for the Northeast Army generals who followed Zhang Xueliang to Beidaihe, in addition to Yu Xuezhong and Shen Honglie, there are also He Zhuguo, Liu Yifei, and other four brigade commanders. Zhang met with the French minister for a long time yesterday. The British minister will also come here from Weihaiwei in a few days. Zhang will return to Shenyang after meeting with the British minister. Hu Ruoyu is scheduled to go to Qingdao during the day to take the position of mayor. (August 25)</p>
<h3 id="e74">After the Malay Peninsula Restricted Chinese Laborers <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Number of Overseas Chinese Exported from Chaozhou and Meizhou Has Decreased by Approximately 100,000</p>
<p>Shantou Communication - The British colonial government of the Nanyang Malay Peninsula has recently experienced a shutdown of tin mines, a sharp drop in the prices of rubber, coffee, coconuts, pepper, gambier, and other products produced in the peninsula, and the adverse effects of rising gold prices. According to a survey by the local government, there are more than 1,578,000 Chinese laborers in the Malay Peninsula. As of the end of July, more than 148,600 people have lost their jobs. In order to maintain the local order in the peninsula, the British colonial government has repatriated unemployed Chinese laborers to Hong Kong, Shantou, and Xiamen and prohibited newly arrived Chinese laborers from seeking employment. Since August 1, it has been trying to restrict the entry of Chinese laborers for a trial period of August, September, and October. If our government does not file a protest, the ordinance restricting the entry of Chinese laborers will be extended indefinitely. It has been found that there are five ships of the Yaji Company, six ships of Jardine Matheson, five ships of Taikoo Dockyard, three ships of the Hetong Company, and one ship of the Hesheng Company that regularly travel to Singapore from Shantou. There are a total of 32 ships that regularly travel between the four ports of Hong Kong, Shantou, Xiamen, and Haikou, with a limited number of 53,160 passengers per year. Calculated at one-quarter, the number of passengers traveling from Shantou to Singapore per year is only over 12,000. According to the number of passengers traveling from Shantou to Singapore in the entire year of 1919, the number reached 110,000. Now, with the sudden restriction, the route for making a living for 100,000 people from Chaozhou and Meizhou is greatly affected. The Shantou Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society has telegraphed the National Government to request that it promptly negotiate with the British side. The Hai Xing ship, which sailed from Shantou to Singapore before the promulgation of this ordinance, carried more than 400 passengers, which was extremely embarrassing. According to what I have heard in Shantou, those who take first- and second-class seats or have overseas passports issued by the Diplomatic Agency are not subject to this restriction. Those who have fixed occupations in Singapore or travel with their wives and children are also relatively convenient, as the local government only wants to crack down on Chinese laborers.

<h3 id="e75">Interrupted Civil Suit Regarding the Xiamen Ferry Disaster <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Bereaved Families Declare Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Wutong ferry disaster in Xiamen was previously ordered by the central government to be transferred to the Provincial High Court for handling. The High Court stated that, according to the judicial jurisdiction, the case should be under the first instance of the Siming Court. If the parties apply for transfer, they should apply to the Xiamen First High Court Branch. Therefore, the case is still being heard by the Siming Court. The bereaved families of the disaster victims originally divided their lawsuit against Quanhe Automobile Company into criminal and civil parts. The civil part has been provisionally suspended upon the application of Quanhe Company, and the court has decided to approve it. The decision was announced yesterday, and the content is as follows: "Siming District Court Civil Decision (Year 19, Di Zi No. 124). Applicant: Chen Youcai, et al. (representatives of Quanhe Automobile Company). In the case of the applicant, etc., versus Su Linchai, et al., regarding compensation, this court has reviewed and decided as follows: Main text: The litigation procedure in this case is provisionally suspended. Reasons: According to Article 246, Paragraph 1 of the Revised Civil Procedure Law, if the trial of all or part of a lawsuit involves another lawsuit, and the establishment of the legal relationship of that other lawsuit should be the basis, the court may order the suspension of the litigation procedure before the conclusion of that other lawsuit. In the case of the applicant and Su Linchai, etc., regarding compensation, it is stated in the petition that because of the ferry disaster, the bereaved families have filed a criminal lawsuit with the Criminal Court. The criminal case has not yet been resolved and the responsibility is unclear. Therefore, the lawsuit for compensation by Su Linchai, etc., should be provisionally suspended until the criminal case is resolved before proceeding further. After investigation, this case involves criminal matters, and the circumstances are significant. The request of the applicant for suspension is in accordance with the aforementioned legal provisions and should be approved. A decision is made as in the main text." It is reported that after receiving the decision, the bereaved families, through their representative Su Linchai, filed an appeal with the Civil Court on the 21st, declaring their dissatisfaction. The court has not yet issued a response.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Russian Warships Inspect Our Merchant Ships <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Navigation Bureau Cables Zhang Shou Zeng for Negotiation</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: On the 7th of this month, five Soviet warships sailed down the Ussuri River and anchored at Sanjiangkou for four days and nights before sailing up the river to Heihe. During the four-day anchorage, when our merchant ships passed, the Russian sailors fired shots into the air, laughing at the panicked state of our sailors and passengers. Fortunately, the warships soon left, otherwise navigation on the Ussuri River would have been interrupted again. Unexpectedly, on the 17th of this month, two more Russian warships, the "Garr Haik" and "Volorening," sailed out of the Semenovskaya military port and, in conjunction with the gunboat "Rabiro," patrolled outside Tongjiang, traveling between Molihong and Xuergu, approaching our Lahasusu Customs. Whenever our merchant ships passed, they raised flags to stop them and sent sailors in small boats to board and inspect the ships. If they found White Russians or Russians without passports, they would detain them. The inspection time often extended to several hours. Our merchant ships, being within their sphere of influence, dared not resist, resulting in severe disruption of navigation on the Ussuri River in recent days. The Northeast Navigation Bureau received a telegram the day before yesterday and has cabled Zhang Shou Zeng, the head of the Heihe Municipal Preparatory Office, to negotiate with the Russians. Furthermore, many navigation markers along the Heilongjiang and Ussuri Rivers were cut down by the Russian army when they invaded last year. Recently, the Ussuri River has become shallow, making navigation difficult. If our merchant ships happen to get close to the Russian bank, the Russian army may, at a minimum, open fire, or, at worst, seize the ship. Russian ships, on the other hand, can navigate the river freely and can even get close to our bank without anyone daring to stop them. Therefore, the Heilongjiang authorities have ordered Zhang Shou Zeng to negotiate with the head of the Russian Waterways Bureau to discuss methods for restoring the navigation markers. It is noted that an international committee was established in 1927 to handle the repair of river channel markers and the surveying of navigation routes on the Heilongjiang and Ussuri Rivers. Last year, due to the Eastern Route issue, the committee could not be convened. This year, diplomatic relations have not been formally restored, and it is not yet known what attitude the Russian side will take regarding the repair of the river channel.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Harbin Plans to Build a Trans-River Bridge <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Construction Cost: 1.97 Million US Dollars</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: North-south traffic in Harbin is hampered by the Songhua River, relying on ferries for transportation. However, there are many dangers during wind and waves, and countless people die from capsized boats every year. Moreover, during the spring thaw, when the ice melts, boats and vehicles cannot pass, making travel even more difficult. This is a great inconvenience for the people on both sides of the river. Recently, the Special Municipal Bureau has proposed building a bridge to connect the north and south sides of the river, with engineer Mr. Pugwozuoer planning and implementing the project. The entire bridge will be made of steel, with a length of 650 meters and a width of 21 meters, completely for the passage of vehicles, horses, and pedestrians. The initial proposed location was from Daoli Artillery Street, passing through Sun Island to Hanyunte Fort on the north bank. It is now rumored that there has been a slight change, with the starting point still being Daoli Artillery Street, but the endpoint is yet to be determined. The construction cost is estimated at 1.975 million US dollars. However, the depth of the river channel varies by 7.05 meters at various points, posing some difficulties for the construction project. After the bridge is completed, tram tracks will be laid in the center, with convenient paths for vehicles, horses, and pedestrians on both sides. The original plan was to prepare materials in the autumn of this year and start construction in the spring of next year. However, merchants in Daowai said that the planned starting and ending points of the bridge are sparsely populated, and they have requested the Chamber of Commerce to forward a request to the Municipal Bureau to start the bridge from the Twelve Daobei Street pier, which is a prosperous area in Daowai, and end it at the Maqiaokou on the north bank. They are willing to pay passage fees for vehicles and horses after the bridge is completed to compensate for the construction costs. The Municipal Bureau has not yet made a decision on this, and construction has not yet started. (27th)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Reasons for the Decline of Soybean Quality in Eastern Provinces <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>German Engineer Advises Improvement</p>
<p>Ministry Orders Northeast to Provide Guidance</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to a report from the consul in Hamburg, stated that Mr. H. Ballmerue, an engineer at the Hawtu Niuhle Oil Extraction Plant, said that the quality of soybeans produced in our country is deteriorating day by day, so the oil content obtained is also decreasing accordingly. The reasons for the deterioration of soybean quality are: (1) seeds are not selected, (2) harvesting is too early, and methods should be devised to improve the situation. It is found that the demand for soybeans in Europe is gradually increasing, so the economic position of North Manchurian soybeans in the world has become important. If the quality decreases, resulting in a gradual reduction in credibility and price, the future of the North Manchurian commercial sector will be extremely significant. Moreover, the factory is the most modern oil extraction plant in Germany. Since 1927, after using new machinery, it has been able to extract approximately 400 tons of oil per day. The above-mentioned points of the chief engineer necessitate that all sectors of our country involved in soybean cultivation make rapid improvements. It is necessary to transfer the information to all chambers of commerce for extra attention to maintain the soybean industry. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs forwarded the information to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for review. The Ministry considered that North Manchurian soybeans are a major product of our country, with an annual export value of no less than tens of millions of taels, which is of utmost importance to the national economy. They immediately sent a notice to the relevant authorities in the Northeast, instructing the competent authorities to devise methods for guidance and improvement in order to maintain national production. After the Jilin Provincial Government approved the notice, it ordered the competent authorities to comply and implement it. (August 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">The Current Economic Situation in Yunnan <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Yunnan's only urgent problem today is the increasingly pessimistic economic situation. According to today's (19th) market conditions, the exchange rate for foreign currencies is as follows: 980 yuan of Yunnan currency is required to exchange for 100 yuan of French francs, 740 yuan for 100 yuan of Hong Kong dollars, and 640 yuan for 100 yuan of Shanghai currency. The province's production is low, and most daily necessities rely on imports, resulting in soaring prices and a declining standard of living for the people. The salaries of officials in various agencies, even senior officials such as provincial committee and department heads, are only several hundred yuan per month, while secretaries and section chiefs receive only one hundred and several tens of yuan. Lu Han, the commander-in-chief of the 38th Army, when concurrently serving as the Director of Finance, once proposed doubling the salaries of officials in various agencies by one and a half times. Although Lu has now departed to suppress the Guangxi case, his successor, Chen Weigeng, is overwhelmed by the sudden increase in expenditures and has repeatedly resigned after being in office for more than a month. The authorities have been unable to retain him. Now, Lu Chongren has been newly appointed as the successor. Lu once headed the Kunming finance department and is said to be close to the provincial chairman, Long Yun. After taking office, he will likely be more effective in handling affairs. However, the only hope of the people is for a decrease in the exchange rate for foreign currencies. It is not known what methods Lu will use to deal with this situation.</p>
<p>Due to the high exchange rate, the authorities are also very anxious. Thus, in addition to the statutory Finance Department, there is also a suddenly arising Financial Reorganization Committee. This committee has been established for some years, but it has not achieved any success in remedying the exchange rate situation. It has now been renamed the Financial Reorganization Committee, and it is headed by provincial committee members Hu Ying and Tang Jilin, as well as division commander Zhang Fengchun. Its effectiveness is yet to be seen.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Special Import Tax Bureau, which was specially established in the provincial capital last December, recently collected customs duties according to the full supplementary water rate of the new gold unit tax rate by the customs office. In order to meet the demands of merchants and residents, the provincial government decided to abolish the Special Tax Bureau at the end of October to reduce the burden on merchants. It is found that since the bureau began collecting taxes until the end of July, the total revenue was approximately 2.8 million yuan in Yunnan currency. Merchants here heard the news that the Special Tax Bureau would be abolished and telegraphed Hong Kong and Shanghai to temporarily suspend ordering goods. However, according to the explanation of Yan Jiguang, the director of the bureau, the bureau has not yet received a clear order to abolish it. If the special tax is scheduled to be abolished at the end of October, it is best for merchants to rush to import goods before the end of October, as this will benefit them. After the customs office collects according to the full gold unit, the tax paid by merchants for bulk goods will be even heavier than the sum of the current special tax and customs duty. For example, the customs duty for every 100 catties of coarse yarn is 32 yuan in Yunnan currency, and the special tax is 15 yuan in Yunnan currency, for a total tax of 47 yuan in Yunnan currency. If the special tax is abolished and the customs office collects according to the full gold unit, the customs duty for every 100 catties of coarse yarn will be 64 yuan in Yunnan currency. For large pieces of fabric, such as twill, the current total customs duty and special tax is 6 yuan and 9 jiao. Starting on November 1, the tax will be 11 yuan and 2 jiao per piece. Other goods can be inferred by analogy. Although the Special Tax Bureau hopes to increase its revenue in the next two months, merchants should consider the value of this matter. (August 19th)</p>

<p>Armed Robbery in Zhuanqiao Town is Repulsed by Military and Police. Zhuanqiao Town, located in the northwest corner of Xin Zhuang, is a necessary transit point for vehicles traveling between Shanghai and Minhang. This morning (1st) at 10:00 AM, four cars carrying more than 20 fierce-looking bandits armed with box-type pistols suddenly stopped. They intended to rob and kidnap, but fortunately, the local defense corps heard the news and took courageous action. The Shanghai Garrison Command also received a telephone report and dispatched a team by train to Zhuanqiao. After getting off the train and assisting in the suppression, the bandits were unable to resist and retreated in disarray. The pursuing troops seized four box-type pistols and the bandits scattered and fled. Fan Zicheng, the captain of the first squad of the Songjiang Water Police District, also received intelligence and immediately led several naval vessels to block the escape route by water and assist in capturing the fleeing bandits. The town was quite alarmed, and the local defense and police forces increased their vigilance. The Public Security Bureau Implements Training for Senior Police Officers. Zhu Huanbo, the director of the Public Security Bureau of this county, has established a refresher course for senior police officers to improve their knowledge and physical fitness.

<h3 id="e81">Wuxi <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Two Robbery Cases in Huaishang and Kaihua. The Wuxi area has been plagued by unrest in the recent month, with robbery cases occurring frequently in the countryside. The day before yesterday, two robbery cases occurred in Huaishang and Kaihua townships. The details are as follows: (1) In Xizhuang Village, Dai Dian Township, Huaishang, a villager named Lu Yongru was previously the local headman. When the headman system was abolished, Lu, due to his age, was replaced by his son, Zifan. Currently, it is the season for raising silkworms. The women of the family were spreading leaves when they suddenly heard someone calling out "Yongru Gong" outside the door. Zifan suspected it was an acquaintance and opened the door in response. Unexpectedly, five bandits with white cloths on their heads and wooden sticks in their hands rushed into the house. Three other bandits stood guard outside the door. After entering the house, the bandits tied up Zifan and struck Lu Yongru on the head with a stick, breaking his skull. They then ransacked the house at will, and left after an hour. It is estimated that they robbed 211 yuan in banknotes, gold and silver jewelry, and men's and women's clothing, for a total loss of approximately 500 yuan. (2) Tao Ruozhou, of Taoxiang Village, Kaihua, usually runs a dye business in Shanghai. Only his daughter-in-law and a few servants remained at home to manage agricultural affairs. The night before last, after 10:00 PM, six or seven bandits wearing short clothes and carrying sharp knives and clubs broke into the house and ransacked it. They robbed clothing and jewelry worth approximately 300 to 400 yuan. Afterward, the Tao family did not report the incident to the county because the bandits were all locals and they did not want to cause trouble.</p>
<p>Request for Instructions on Business Tax Collection. The County Chamber of Commerce recently received instructions from the Provincial Government through the County Government stating that the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly has decided to implement a business tax, and it has been scheduled to convene representatives from all county chambers of commerce in the province on October 1 to discuss the implementation. As this matter is important, a public notice is issued to solicit opinions from various industries on the case, which must be submitted to the Chamber in writing by the 10th of this month for reference. Furthermore, as the method of collection has not been clearly promulgated, a telegram was sent to the Provincial Department of Finance yesterday requesting a prompt investigation and filing of the case.</p>
<p>Bloody Incident After Slaughtering Cattle. Ma Xingsheng, a migrant worker from Shandong province and over 30 years old, who lived behind the slaughterhouse on Liangxi Road, Qiaodong, was a small worker at the Maoxin Flour Mill. His wife, Zhao, 25 years old, worked at the Baofeng Silk Mill. Yesterday morning, Gu Dabao, a fellow worker, asked Ma for membership fees. Ma was not at home, so he talked with Zhao in the room, and Zhao treated him to vegetable porridge. At 11:00 AM, Ma Xingsheng returned home and saw his wife and Gu Dabao talking intimately at the table, arousing his suspicions. He became extremely angry and rushed into the room with a kitchen knife, shouting, "Shameless!" Gu was shocked and hid under the bed. Ma dragged him out and slashed him twice, and Gu fell to the ground unconscious. Zhao stepped forward to persuade him and was also slashed twice on the left side of her face. Neighbors heard the commotion and went to twist Ma Xingsheng over to the police. The injured Gu Dabao was sent to Puren Hospital, and Zhao was sent to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. Gu's injuries were severe, and he was unconscious. Zhao's injuries were lighter. Relatives from both sides have submitted a petition to the County Government requesting an injury examination and legal action. Apprentices from a Rice Shop Who Ran Away Have Been Found. Jia Shixing, Fan Futang, and Lu Duansheng, apprentices from the Xinxin Rice Shop outside the North Gate of this county, because they were fond of reading martial arts novels and admired the swordsmen in the books, took with them on the afternoon of the 26th self-made iron swords, tents, and other items and ran away together. It has been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that on the afternoon of the 26th, Jia, Fan, and Lu hired a streetcar to go to Meiwu and Huazang on the shores of Taihu Lake. It is said that they were traveling around to visit immortals. That night, they slept in the Guanwang Temple and prayed for good fortune. The next day, they went down the mountain together and arrived at the Hu Dai Town in the Seventeenth District (Fuan Township). On the way, a villager named Jia saw Jia and others hurrying along and asked them where they were going with so much luggage. Jia and others replied that they were going to Hu Dai Town. Jia and others then threw two iron swords and a tent into Taihu Lake to avoid suspicion and questioning. After arriving at Hu Dai, they stayed at an inn in the town. That night, the town's merchants patrolled the inn and found two iron darts in Jia's luggage. The merchants asked them what they were for, and Jia and others replied that they were toys and had no other use. The merchants confiscated the iron darts and took them back to the team headquarters. Afterward, Jia and the others regretted that they had thrown the iron swords and tents into the lake and had their iron darts confiscated. They decided to go back, but they were afraid of being ridiculed. If they returned home, they were afraid that their parents would punish them. Therefore, they decided not to return home and went to Changzhou to join the army. On the morning of the 28th, they left the town, went to Daixi Bridge in the Sixth District, and took a boat to Changzhou. They used aliases to enlist in the First Division of the Training Corps stationed in Changzhou, Jia Shixing used the alias Jia Chunting, Fan Futang used the alias Fan Jianpeng, and Lu Duansheng used the alias Lu Qishi. That night, the recruiting office sent Jia, Fan, and Lu by car to the General Office of the Training Corps in Xiaguan, Nanjing, to await assignment to various battalions. Jia's relatives, after hearing the news of their running away, were extremely anxious and searched everywhere. Jia Hanping, Jia Shixing's father, found three small notes in his son's bamboo box in the rice shop's warehouse, one of which read, "All the mandarin jackets are in Xiaosifang Alley. I have joined the front line. Please do not worry." Therefore, he went to Zhenjiang and Nanjing by car with his wife's brother, Xuan Zhongqin, to search for them. On the 30th, he found his son and others serving as soldiers in the Training Corps in Xiaguan, Nanjing. He went to the recruiting office of the Training Corps and reported the circumstances of Jia and the others' running away. The director of the office approved the release of Jia and the others on bail. Mr. X, the director of the office, considered that Jia and the others were apprentices from a rice shop and should not join the army. He immediately approved the release on bail, and Jia Hanping took them back that day by night train to Wuxi. They are currently staying at the Shengchang Hotel on Guangfumen Wai, Hanchang Road, and plan to have them return to work in the rice shop within a few days. As for Lu, his father, Lu Jinkui, also went to Beijing yesterday to request his release.</p>
<p>A Case of Framing and False Accusation in a Forced Marriage. Li Ahu (also known as Shouhuan, from Qingyang, Jiangyin), a partner at the Yuanyuan Shoe Workshop under the Liulang Bridge in Wuxi, is over 20 years old and not yet married. Recently, Yang Shouquan (from Shitou, Wuxi), a partner at the neighboring Huiyuansheng Paint Workshop, had a whimsical idea and colluded with Sheng Tianfu from Wujin to marry Sheng Tianfu's second daughter, Sheng Xiuying, to Li Ahu. At that time, Yang Shouquan extorted 50 yuan from Li as a matchmaker fee. The total cost was over 100 yuan. After the marriage, they rented a house from the Shen family at Rihui Bridge outside the South Gate. Unexpectedly, Yang Shouquan suddenly instructed Sheng Xiuying's brother, Sheng Yuechun, to come to Wuxi from Changzhou to extort 50 yuan from Li Ahu. Li replied that he did not have it. Sheng Yuechun became angry and twisted Li over to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, falsely accusing Li Ahu of abducting his sister, Sheng Xiuying. The director of the branch sent both parties together to the Public Security Bureau, which transferred them to the County Government for interrogation. Li Ahu was sentenced to eight months in prison. Afterward, Li Shouhong, Li Ahu's elder brother, filed a petition with the County Government yesterday, stating that his younger brother had been falsely accused and imprisoned. He requested that Li Ahu be temporarily released on bail leniently and that a secret investigator be sent to investigate the facts and arrest the masterminds, Yang Shouquan and Sheng Yuechun, to be brought to justice.</p>

<p>Salt Smugglers Run Rampant in the Countryside. The Pudong gang of salt smugglers clashed with the anti-smuggling team in Shitang Town, Wuxi. The ringleader, Zhang Xiaoxiansheng, was killed on the spot. The remaining bandits fled to Yangcheng Lake, heading towards Changshu, robbing civilian ships and planning to retaliate against the anti-smuggling team. The Wuxian Police Team reported yesterday (1st) that the gang of bandits is now concentrated in Yangcheng Lake and Beishi and is harassing nearby villages. Two women in the Yin Guo area were raped and injured. Captain Du received the report and immediately dispatched the First Company to suppress the bandits.</p>
<p>Another 400+ Wounded Soldiers Arrive. Four hundred and some wounded soldiers were transferred from Nanjing to the Seventeenth Rear Hospital in Suzhou at 2:00 AM yesterday (1st). 130 lightly wounded soldiers were sent back to Nanjing by a team dispatched by the Fourth Regiment of the Military Police at 3:00 PM in the afternoon due to the hospital being full.</p>
<p>A Youth from Wenzhou Hangs Himself at Tiger Hill. Tang Lin (Zhibo), a youth from Wenzhou, hanged himself in the Tiger Hill Pagoda yesterday (1st). He was rescued, and a suicide note was found. The note stated that his father, Tang Qiu, also known as Yuanlong, is currently an official in Xuzhou. He wrote a letter to Leqing County, Wenzhou, summoning him to Xuzhou. He took his servant, Zhang Wending, and detoured to Shanghai, staying at the Dasheng Hotel in the South City. 412 yuan and 6 jiao in travel expenses were robbed by bandits, and Zhang died in the hotel. He sold his luggage to bury Zhang and then came to Suzhou to visit friends, but he was unsuccessful and had difficulty making a living. Therefore, he hanged himself. He has now been sent to the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Lake Bandits Invade Suzhou Territory and Plunder. The Pudong gang of bandits from Taozhuang, near Jiashan, Zhejiang, were dispersed by the Zhejiang Second District Water Police Team and the Zhejiang Provincial Defense Army at Yujiahui Zhangliantang and other places. The surviving bandits fled to the Guanpu area of Guoxiang, Wuxian County, yesterday (31st) afternoon. About 80 bandits in six ships landed in the town and bought food. The stationed Pan Shui Land and Water Police Team suspected them and detained 16 of them. They claimed to be refugees. According to a report from Gong, the chief of the Third District of the Public Security Bureau, Captain Xu Boying of the Eleventh Company was ordered to dispatch eight naval vessels to suppress the bandits.</p>

<p>Military Police Set Off to Block Key Coastal Locations. Yesterday, armed forces and government agencies in this county received a telegram from Li Mingyang, the director of the Provincial Security Department, stating that, due to the increasing number of robbery cases in Chongming, Qidong, and the neighboring coastal areas of our county, a telegram was sent to key coastal locations to prevent and block them. Wang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, was in Shanghai on official business when he received the telegram. Lv Baozhong, the chief inspector, dispatched approximately 50 patrol officers and box-type pistol squads from various police stations in the urban and rural areas. He led them to the coastal locations. Beforehand, Inspector Lv and Yang Qingjiu, the captain of the Thirteenth Water Police Team, and Qian Mobin, the captain of the County Public Security Team, discussed the methods for the troops to go to the coast to suppress the bandits, such as the east-west deployment methods at key locations such as Fushan, Hupu, and Baimao, and designated defense areas to facilitate military operations. He also notified the water patrol team stationed at Gengjingkou and the various sub-bureaus of public security along the river to be on strict alert. The departing troops set off at 1:00 PM on the 31st of last month on gasoline ships. However, Captain Qian Mobin of the police team did not personally go because County Chief Tan and Director Wang of the Public Security Bureau were both away from Changzhou on important official business. He specially sent Jin, the special affairs officer, to lead the team.</p>
<p>Five Hostages Escape from Wangshi Town. In the second robbery in Wangshi Town, five men and women from the Shao, Gu, and Da families were kidnapped. Initially, the bandits demanded exorbitant prices. Because the families refused, an intermediary negotiated a price of 700 yuan for Da Tongchang and 400 yuan for Gu Tongxing to be released first. After the bandits received the money, they said that all five hostages in Wangshi Town must pay the money for their release and that they would not be released piecemeal. Therefore, the children of the Da and Gu families were still in the bandits' den. However, their families were extremely anxious and asked someone to negotiate with the kidnapped Shao and Chen families. After negotiating a result, they went to Da'an Port to negotiate with the bandits. Until the 29th, the men and women from the Shao, Gu, and Da families returned to the south from Da'an Port. It is reported that, in addition to the 1,100 yuan already paid by the Gu and Da families, the Shao family paid 1,400 yuan for the apprentice Wu Xiangbao and Tang. The Chen family paid 700 yuan for their apprentice.</p>

<p>First Day of the Guangdong-Hong Kong Table Tennis Cup: Tianma Wins Against Japan Team: Guangdong Plays Hong Kong Team Tonight.</p>
<p>The Guangdong-Hong Kong Table Tennis Cup, which had been advertised for a long time, started last night. The venue was still the Jiande Gymnasium. There were more than 300 guests, 1/5 of whom were Japanese. When the bell rang eight times, the referee Yu Binqi flipped a bronze coin to determine the two sides of the battle. With a whistle of a silver flute, applause sounded like thunder. Zeng Rongzong was invited to be the recorder. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Team Tianma Team Result Winner</p>
<p>Matsuda Lu Hanjun 1 to 3 Tianma</p>
<p>Ikeda Lu Shentong 3 to 2 Japan</p>
<p>Nagata Zhu Guisheng 3 to 1 Japan</p>
<p>Hirano Sun Jianqu 2 to 3 Tianma</p>
<p>Enta Ma Tingliang 2 to 3 Tianma</p>
<p>Brief Review of the Game: Matsuda of Japan is a veteran player who is good at defending the ball. Lu Hanjun of Tianma is good at drawing the ball. Once they meet, they are evenly matched. In the end, Lu won because of his deft serve. In the second match, Ikeda of Japan played against Lu Shentong of Tianma. Ikeda is the king of the Japanese team. He has played for more than ten years and has rarely lost. He has been the leader of the Japanese team in Shanghai for many years. However, he has not played for two years due to illness. Lu is the representative of our country to the Far East Games. He is good at defending the ball and can play from both near and far. However, Ikeda's draw ball is very strong. Although Lu tried to defend, he was ultimately unable to cope, resulting in failure. In the third match, Nagata of Japan played against Zhu Guisheng of Tianma. After Ikeda's illness and rest, Nagata has repeatedly won individual championships. He just returned to Shanghai from Japan last night. He is good at drawing and defending. Zhu is from Wuxi. Tianma specially sent Lu to Wuxi to invite him. He also showed his sophisticated skills and was good at drawing the ball, but in the end, he lost due to lack of strength. In the fourth match, Sun Jianqu of Tianma played against Hirano of Japan. Sun won the first individual prize when he was pre-selected for the eighth Far East Games. He is good at attacking and defending, and is suitable for both near and far. Although Hirano actively responded, he could not last long and was defeated by Sun. The fifth match was between Ma Tingliang of Tianma and Enta of the Japanese team. Ma is known as the "cowhide candy king" in the Wuxi Ping-Pong world. At first, he failed to draw the ball, but then he used his true colors to win the final victory. This was a fortunate thing for Tianma and also the credit of Lu Shentong's running around in Wuxi.</p>
<p>Nanhua's Declaration of Not Participating in the European Tour (Considerations): There are three main reasons for not being able to participate: The Chinese Expedition Team's Organization is flawed (August 20 Singapore Correspondence). The Nanhua team members' triumphant return to Hong Kong was the same number as when they came to Singapore from Hong Kong, with not a single warrior staying in Singapore. From this, it can be concluded that the Nanhua team members will not participate in the Chinese Expedition Football Team's trip to Europe. Regarding this point, the reporter specially went to Hu Wenhu's villa in Baisibanrang before the team left Singapore to visit the team. It happened that the leader of the team, He Run Guang, was not there, so the team's Chinese secretary, Yu Juxian, received him. The following is a brief record of what was discussed at that time: The reasons why the Nanhua team members cannot participate in the expedition to Europe, according to Yu, are roughly three: First, there was no formal contact. When the Nanhua members who attended the Far East Games, such as Ye Beihua, Li Tiansheng, and Liang Xianzhan, returned to China and passed through Shanghai, Yu Hengzhi verbally invited Tiansheng, Beihua, and Feng Jingxiang to join the expedition to Europe. However, it was only a verbal and personal exchange, which was certainly not enough to be formal. Therefore, the fact that the three of them did not go this time was largely due to the fact that the expedition team did not formally borrow team members from the Nanhua Sports Association at that time. The second reason is the funding issue. The expedition team was not fully prepared this time. The funding only relied on ticket sales along the way. The trip to Java might get 28,000 guilders (equivalent to 20,000 Dutch dollars or 40,000 Chinese dollars). This small amount is only enough for expenses before leaving Singapore. Moreover, the team members are not many, and if there are illnesses or injuries, no one can replace them. How can they predict victory? If they lose every battle, no one will care about them, and the lifeline of the expedition team depends on ticket sales. Therefore, if the funding is not available, it is difficult to advance or retreat, and the team members will suffer. At this time, how will the Nanhua General Association arrange for its team members? This is the second reason. The third reason is that I am afraid that the expedition team will be suspected of being professional. If the team members return after the war, it will be difficult to participate in various competitions. If there is a long period of suspension, can the team members' skills still be expected to be flexible? This is the third reason. The above three points are the important points that Yu Juxian talked about. According to his personal opinion, Hengzhi should first obtain permission from the central government agencies (such as the China Sports Association), and then it would be easy to select and transfer players from the north and south. He once asked Hengzhi about this, but Hengzhi said that it is easy to be laughed at if things don't work out, but it is easy to be envied if they do. Therefore, he did not publicly announce the process of inviting team members to proceed. Mr. Juxian believes that the world may not fully know about the secret progress, but how can people in the sports world not know? When the expedition team passed through Hong Kong this time, the Nanhua Association also held a meeting to welcome them and extremely supported their European expedition. Perhaps, it is said that the Nanhua Association is tricking them, but supporting is one thing, and participating is another. They did not contact the association in advance, so the fact that the three of them did not go was not against reason. Also, when the Nanhua team was in Kuala Lumpur, Hengzhi flew from Java to Malaysia to talk to Tiansheng, Beihua, and Jingxiang. The Nanhua team allowed it, but the result was that the three of them were not willing to go, which was also due to the above three reasons. The reporter also asked Juxian because the Singapore Star Island Daily has been reporting that the Nanhua team is dissatisfied with the fact that the expedition team is still using the name "Lehua." He said that this is not very relevant. When Lehua went to Australia years ago, some Nanhua people joined, but the name was not changed. For example, in a competition in Hong Kong, Hui Tang came to help the Nanhua team, so the name is not very relevant. However, in the reporter's opinion, Nanhua is not dissatisfied with the expedition team still using the name "Lehua". Even if there is dissatisfaction, they should understand because the Singapore media believe that most of the people who came to this expedition team are strong Lehua players, and "Lehua" is also familiar to people and has been to this country once. Therefore, all the records still use "Lehua." The expedition team did not ask the media to correct the name, which is also a fact. However, the Lehua team members rarely read newspapers because they live in Baisibanrang, which is too far from the city. However, several newspapers sent the newspapers of the day to read about the competition news, but the expedition team did not pay attention to it because there were only two competitions in Singapore. However, most of the newspapers in Java used the new name of the expedition team. The above is the opinion of Nanhua. In the future, the expedition team will probably have their own words. When they return to Singapore, they will visit Hengzhi again to inform the readers. The team can return to Singapore in about a week.</p>

<p>Recovering the Telephone Rights in the Concession: The Result of Soliciting Opinions from Chinese Users</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the case of recovering the telephone rights in the concession has been making a lot of noise for a long time. The Chinese Users' Association has always advocated peaceful struggle and insisted on it to the end. The association previously sent letters to Chinese users to collect opinions. According to the person in charge of the association, the Chinese users have submitted their opinions after receiving the letters from the association. Now, more than 41 letters have been received successively. They are very resentful of the Municipal Council's abuse of power, damage to China's transportation administration, and the International Telephone and Telegraph Company's unauthorized purchase and operation without the approval of our government. They all asked to fight to the end and never waver. Some came to the association to consult and ask for instructions on the boycott policy, some were willing to donate funds to maintain it, some advocated that the telephone rights should be automatically recovered by the Ministry of Communications immediately without relying on the power of the concession, some proposed to jointly refuse to pay telephone bills or refuse to use the concession telephone and switch to domestic telephones, and some advocated that Chinese users should jointly invest capital to organize a cooperative company for self-management. The various opinions with the most suggestions from each user and those that are feasible are listed on the left: (1) Chinese users unanimously refuse to have business relations with the International Telephone and Telegraph Company that despises our national sovereignty. (2) Request the Ministry of Communications to form a special agency to handle the telephone business in the Shanghai Special Zone. (3) Request the Ministry of Communications to order the Shanghai North and South City Telephone Bureaus to first recover the telephone rights in the areas beyond the boundaries as soon as possible. (4) Request the National Government to order the customs to ban the import of all telephone materials that have not been approved by the government. (5) Request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to conduct serious negotiations again and actively recover the Shanghai Concession as a fundamental solution. (6) The Chinese people who serve the company should rise up to support national rights and, when necessary, use serious and effective means not to cooperate and urge them to reflect.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Users' Association plans to consider the actual situation and actively proceed based on the opinions put forward by the users. Unless the International Telephone and Telegraph Company submits it for approval and supervision by our government, it will never stop the movement. It is also heard that the association plans to collect and sort out the candidates put forward by each user and formally announce them to the elected members, so that the association can become a permanent organization and a permanent protection agency for the interests of users, and carry out a continuous struggle with the international company.</p>
<p>The Silkworm Cocoon Issue is Resolved Invisibly, and Chinese Silkworm Merchants Vigorously Oppose It</p>
<p>Japanese Representatives Telegraph to Stop Loading and Will Go to French Markets to Visit.</p>
<p>Mr. Takahashi, a representative of the Japanese Silkworm Cocoon Industry who came to Shanghai, is staying at the hostel. Mr. Takahashi is the director of the Japan Silk Cocoon Industry Association and was sent to Shanghai this time to negotiate the transaction of Japanese silkworm cocoons and promote sales. According to Mr. Takahashi, the harvest of spring and summer cocoons in Japan this year is very rich, but most of the silk factories have stopped working due to various reasons, resulting in an oversupply of raw materials and no way to sell them. Local farmers are forced to seek other sales channels due to their difficult situation. At that time, people from Chinese silk factories came to Japan to negotiate the purchase of Japanese cocoons, and it was decided to sell the surplus dried cocoons from spring and summer to China. This time, I came to Shanghai to carry sample cocoons and ask the factories to try them out. Unfortunately, Chinese cocoon merchants have been strongly opposed to them for days, causing Chinese silk factories to have concerns and shrink back. Judging from the current situation, it is feared that Japanese cocoons will be difficult to continue to be transported to Shanghai for import. Therefore, I have changed to contact silk merchants in the United States and France for days. Fortunately, French merchants are happy to purchase them, and it has been decided to go to France to open up the Japanese cocoon market. I have telegraphed the cocoon merchants in the mainland to stop loading. After that, no more cocoons will be transported to Shanghai. The remaining large quantities of dried cocoons are actually very beneficial.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the issue of transporting Japanese cocoons to Shanghai will be resolved invisibly.</p>
<p>Recently, Chinese Silk Exports Reached 35,868 Bales</p>
<p>According to a recent survey, Chinese silk exports have become more developed again. Although sales in Europe have decreased slightly, sales in the Americas have increased sharply. The exact numbers are recorded below: 8,696 bales were shipped to Europe, 24,631 bales to the United States, and 2,558 bales to other countries, for a total of 35,868 bales.</p>

<p>Opening Remarks</p>

It was originally planned to convene a meeting to discuss all the important issues in the meeting as soon as possible. Because many directors were away from Shanghai on official business, the meeting was postponed to today. Recently, the specialized committee needs to hold a meeting to decide on the scope of research and implementation plan, and many directors of the association also serve as directors and deputy directors of the specialized committee. Therefore, for the convenience of all, the joint meeting of the directors and deputy directors of various groups was held at the same time. I am deeply grateful for your presence and hope that you will express your great opinions.</p>
<p>After the speech, (1) the secretary-general reported on the recent progress, and then discussed the second proposal. It was decided to revise and follow the third proposal. It was decided to retain the fourth proposal. It was decided to urge each resigning member to urge the fifth proposal. First, the secretary-general reported the amount of income and expenditure and said that Director Kong had agreed to donate a special donation of 1,000 yuan to the association, which has been received in full today. It was decided that the preparation fee would be allocated by the association. The sixth proposal was to add a legal system team, and the board of directors would appoint another member. The seventh proposal was to find a way to borrow, and the eighth proposal was to recommend members to prepare. (9) Temporary proposal: Director Qian Chengxu proposed to expand the implementation of the regular lecture proposal, and it was decided to combine it with the eighth proposal.</p>
<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>The Secretariat was entrusted by the Board of Directors to handle the daily affairs of the association. After receiving the order, it immediately began to prepare and was officially established on July 9 and began to work. For a month, everyone has been actively working to achieve practical results as soon as possible. However, since it was just established, there were some difficulties in the process due to various reasons. The following is a report on the various affairs of the association since its establishment:</p>
<p>(A) Process of Soliciting Members</p>
<p>At the beginning of the association, most people in the industry and commerce circles did not know the purpose of the association, so it was slightly difficult to solicit members. However, since the solicitation began, 80 individual members and 30 group members have been obtained. In addition, the specialized committee members of the association are all basic members, so the total number of members is more than 200.</p>
<p>(B) Necessity of Fundraising</p>
<p>Although the association has tried its best to save on recurring expenses, it needs funds to purchase reference books and edit and publish projects. If it does not try to raise funds, the association will have to stop.</p>
<p>(C) Summary of the Work of Various Groups of the Specialized Committee</p>
<p>Before the specialized committee held a meeting, the secretariat had initially set the date of the research meeting for each group, and then convened a joint meeting of the specialized committee and the directors and deputy directors of each group at the Bank Guild on July 30 to discuss the scope of research of each group and avoid duplication. It was decided that the deputy director of each group would first formulate research questions and convene the committee members of the group to discuss them. After the decision, the secretariat would be submitted for filing, and then a joint meeting of the directors and the directors and deputy directors of each group would be convened for the final decision. It was also decided that each group would separately draft proposals and submit them to the National Industrial and Commercial Conference. On August 1, the Finance Group held its first research meeting to discuss the scope of research and implementation methods. It was decided that three items, such as the research plan, whether the enterprise is consistent with its scheduled capital amount, the use and expansion of the company's funds, and the reasons for the company's liquidation, merger, and bankruptcy, would be the outline of the research. Li, the deputy director, and Cai, the committee member Shuixin, were publicly elected to draft the details of the research outline and submit them to the secretariat for printing and distribution to the committee members for identification and research first, so that they could be discussed at the next meeting. A proposal was also decided to be submitted to the Board of Directors to propose the establishment of a legal system group. On August 6, the Personnel Group held its first research meeting to discuss for more than three hours. In the end, due to the importance of the issue and the short time, it was unable to obtain its specific methods. It only assumed the following three items as the research outline: (1) Employment, dismissal, and transfer; (2) Union and bonus system; (3) Seeking the happiness and safety of workers. The committee members Qian Chengxu, Liu Zongqiang, and Cai Zhengya were publicly elected to draft the research outline and details of the group and set it to convene a temporary meeting on August 11 for further discussion. On August 9, the Management Group held its first research meeting, which was chaired by Director Liu Hongsheng. It was decided that the group's research outline would be as follows: (1) Establishment and organization issues. Xu Yong and Li Gan were recommended to be responsible. (2) Merger and joint business issues. Director Liu Hongsheng and Lu Fei, member Bohong, were recommended to be responsible. (3) Rationalization issues. The committee member Yicheng and Secretary-General Shi Youming were recommended to be responsible. (4) Raw material issues. Deputy Director Bingwen and committee member Xu Chao were recommended to be responsible. On August 11, the Personnel Group held its first temporary meeting to discuss the research outline drafted by the committee members. It was decided to revise the research outline of the Personnel Group as follows: (1) Research on the method of selecting employees to achieve the purpose of selecting people for the job and selecting jobs for people. (2) Research on the method of cultivating the service ethics and service discipline of employees. (3) Research on the method of improving the work efficiency of employees. (4) Plan for employee welfare undertakings. (5) Research on employee treatment methods and the implementation methods of the Personnel Group (1) Research questions (2) Collect data (3) Collect and discuss (4) Suggest solutions and decide on several research questions. 推 committee members to be responsible for the research. One organization plan of the factory personnel department. Cai Zhengya, Liu Pinqiang, and Xu Zhiyi were recommended to be responsible for drafting. Two collect the materials about personnel in the industry and commerce circles. Committee member Qian Chengxu was recommended to be responsible. Three research labor laws and regulations. Deputy Director Qian Tao and committee members Leqin and Zhang Zhuping were responsible. On August 12, the Accounting Group held its first research meeting. It was decided that the group's research outline would be established and committee members would be promoted to be responsible for the research in order to achieve practical results as soon as possible. The resolution is as follows: (1) Ordinary commercial application accounting format. Yang Ruqian, Qian Zuling, and An Shaoyun were recommended to be responsible for ordinary accounting, and Deputy Director Gu Yiqun and Yan, member Oujia, were responsible for financial accounting. (2) Research on the most common errors in the old Chinese accounting methods. Director Pan Xulun and Gu, member Xun, were recommended to be responsible. (3) Unified accounting name. Director Pan and members An and Yang were recommended to be responsible. (4) Cost accounting. Zhao Tang, Sun Ruihuang, Wang Zhiwei, and Hua Runquan were recommended to be responsible. (5) Research on the accounting methods between the head office and branches. Chen Riping, Li Jinghan, and Zhu Boquan were recommended to be responsible. On August 20, the Affairs Group held its first research meeting. Because the boundaries were unclear, there was no sufficient preparation in advance, and a concrete plan could not be discussed immediately. It was decided that the secretariat would send a letter to each committee member to explain the meaning of the Affairs Group and ask each committee member to draft a research outline and send it to Deputy Director Chen Canglai for sorting and submission to the secretariat for printing by the 26th of this month. A temporary meeting of the group will be held at 5:15 PM on September 1 at the Lianhua General Assembly Hall for further discussion on the research outline, which has been</p>

<p>Random Notes While Traveling</p>
<p>By Songlu, written while traveling in Jin Chang</p>
<p>For a month now, I have suffered from the heat and been troubled by writing debts. I bury myself in my desk all day, and my brain swells. So I put everything aside and took a half-month wandering trip. In the past ten days or so, I have been rushing back and forth on the road. I have been to many places worth mentioning. So I will pick up one or two to leave a trace.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province has bright mountains and beautiful waters, with natural scenery. The lakes are especially beautiful. On this wandering trip, I visited three famous lakes: East Lake in Shaoxing, South Lake in Jiaxing, and West Lake in Hangzhou. Each of these three lakes has its own character. If I were to compare them, West Lake is like a beauty, East Lake is like a female knight, and South Lake is like a well-bred lady from a great family. Jian Lake is like a village girl, without makeup. Tai Lake is like a respected monk in an ancient temple, empty and devoid of material possessions. This makes one even more marvel at the greatness of the Creator.</p>
<p>Suzhou has many famous gardens, Hangzhou has many villas, but Jiashan uniquely has many opium dens. During my five days of traveling in Jiashan, guided by a fisherman from Wulin, I visited more than thirteen places. Each house had a young girl to provide service. Those who enter can swallow clouds and spit out mist, and get drunk on the moon and sit among the flowers. Ordinary young people with weak wills all become infatuated.</p>
<p>The practice of raising nuns has been banned by the national government. However, in Mandarin Duck Lake, this custom has not diminished. I have been traveling in Zhejiang for a long time, and I have often heard my friends from He mention the licentious customs of the nunneries there. This time, when I was traveling in He, I went to visit. I sailed to the center of the lake, and after another mile, I saw a corner of a red wall, which was the place. The gate of the nunnery was tightly closed. I knocked and it opened. An old woman greeted us in. Then she called out three or four young nuns, all sixteen or seventeen years old. Although they were bald and wearing monastic robes, their appearance was not bad. When they saw us, they brought out melon seeds and green beans, as well as boiled tea to serve us. I sat for a while and then left. As I was leaving, I tossed a silver coin as a tea fee. The nuns didn't even say thank you. Afterwards, I asked the locals, who said that there used to be a "Sending Children Nunnery" here. The nuns there were more beautiful than prostitutes. Now they have been driven out of the country by the county government.</p>
<p>In the Hundred Lions Pool in Hangzhou, there is a giant turtle, large enough to be bigger than a table. It is said that it was raised by Qin Hui of the Song Dynasty to prevent theft. Although this cannot be verified, it is definitely an object from hundreds of years ago. There are also many turtles in the West Garden Pool in Suzhou. Although they are not as big as those in Hangzhou, the larger ones are as big as laundry tubs. According to the pool, it is a liberation pond, and this achievement is all a result of good deeds. The people of Wu are kind and gentle, which can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Those who have been traveling in Shanghai for a long time often lament the high cost of living at sea. In fact, the cost of living in the capital is even higher. Just take travel expenses as an example. A small, simple bed costs two gold pieces. And the bedding and mosquito nets all require additional fees. Tea and water also cost money. The so-called two yuan rent only includes a bed and a table, and nothing else. Therefore, a night in the capital costs at least four or five gold pieces. It is truly difficult to live in Chang'an.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Random Notes from the Xuyuan Garden <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>By Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>I haven't written poetry in a while. Last night, in a dream, I suddenly heard the sound of cicadas. I suspected it was dawn. I pushed open the window and looked out, and the moonlight was bright. I tried to summarize it in one or two sentences, but I couldn't. Last year, I had two lines: "Cool moonlight under tall trees, startled cicadas move to old branches." The scenery was exactly the same, but I couldn't continue to write it. Yesterday I received a letter from my old friend Wang Dun'gen, asking me to write a poem for the book "The Spring Colors of the Han Palace" published by Xinhua Bookstore. He said that the book was co-authored by Xu Xiaotian and Xu Zheshen. The story begins with Ying Qin and ends with the Western Han Dynasty. It is based on historical material and does not involve obscenity, etc. So I wrote four quatrains as a prelude:</p>
<p>Burning books not yet finished, laugh at Emperor Qin,</p>
<p>Carrying poles, they ascend the stage again.</p>
<p>But say the spring colors of the Han Palace are good,</p>
<p>Wanting people to learn from the rise and fall.</p>
<p>Gains and losses not all from horseback,</p>
<p>Licentiousness mostly from the boudoir.</p>
<p>Yang Xiong's fu has no successor,</p>
<p>But now there are unofficial historians.</p>
<p>Xu Guo once praised a grand style,</p>
<p>Xu Ling was especially good at petty cleverness.</p>
<p>How can the two difficulties and three wonders be seen?</p>
<p>The four parts are re-judged by Wang Shizhen.</p>
<p>Is the official historian like the unofficial historian?</p>
<p>The new places are all warmed by the old.</p>
<p>Wine does not need any other things,</p>
<p>Let the merits and crimes of Yuntai be discussed later.</p>
<p>Because Dun'gen's letter said that it did not involve the affairs of the Eastern Han Dynasty. Such occasional pieces are often unsatisfactory. But I am pleased with these four poems, they are refreshing and do not fall into clichés. And "boudoir and horseback" are, in my opinion, generally the case throughout ancient and modern times. This entire twenty-five-history can almost be summarized in these fourteen words.</p>
<p>Laughable Anecdotes Never Heard Of</p>
<p>By Zhecun</p>
<p>Yesterday, I attended a dinner party. There were many eloquent guests, and all of them were worth listening to. Each of them told a story that was a laughable anecdote that had never been heard of. I will retell them to amuse the readers.</p>
<p>A Hand Stretches Out From Inside the Coffin</p>
<p>During a major epidemic in a certain place in a certain year, the coffin shops (another name for coffin shops) were making three times their usual profit. They worked day and night, rushing to make coffins. A man named Sun died. After buying a coffin, the body was placed in it and buried immediately. Just as the coffin was being carried out the door, a few steps away, the middle section of the bottom of the coffin suddenly fell out. The deceased's hand actually protruded from outside the coffin. Upon inspection, it was discovered that a row of nails was missing from the middle section of the bottom of the coffin. This was probably due to rushing and carelessness. Moreover, the bottom of the coffin was too thin. After being filled with weight, it broke open. The crowd was angry. They discussed tying the coffin with ropes and carrying it to the coffin shop to exchange it for a thicker coffin and re-bury the body, as a condition for negotiation. They also demanded compensation for the lime and other materials. As a result, many people said, "A hand stretches out from inside the coffin." This was originally a riddle for the two words "death wants." Now, Sun can be said to have put this phrase into practice. Sun was originally a greedy person in life. Now, with a single hand, he was able to exchange it for a good coffin. It is especially accurate to give him this phrase as a gift.</p>
<p>Two Thousand Yuan for Pig Life Insurance</p>
<p>During the Jiazi war, a rich man named Chen in a certain village hid two thousand yuan in cash in the pigsty. He dug open the pig pen to its deepest point and buried it there. (Piled rice straw ash and other discarded filth into the pigsty, called the "pig pen," which farmers used to fertilize the fields.) Then, when the soldiers arrived, they searched Chen's house and gathered to cook rice and slaughter chickens and ducks to eat. They also saw a pig and plotted to slaughter it for a feast. Just as they entered the pen to catch the pig, they caught a glimpse of silver coins. The pig was fond of digging. After the owner buried the silver, the pig pen was slightly loose, so the pig dug it open. The soldiers were overjoyed. They dug out all two thousand yuan, divided it up, and left. They ended up not slaughtering the pig. The lives of the two pigs in the pen were spared. A neighbor of his, who was usually humorous, said to others, "These two thousand yuan are the pig life insurance that Chen paid for the two pigs." It is strange that Chen is so stingy with himself but so generous with the pigs. People asked him why, and then they learned that Chen had once discussed buying life insurance at the suggestion of a relative, but he stopped because he was stingy. So his neighbor used this phrase to mock him.</p>
<p>Testing Record</p>
<p>By Ke Ke</p>
<p>Recently, those who returned from visiting the Great World Entertainment Center often talked about the spectacle of testing eyesight and memory. They said that the free gifts prepared, such as beauty pictures and floral water, could easily fly into everyone's hands. Young children were naturally delighted to receive them, and participation did not cost a penny, which made it popular. Yesterday evening, with nothing to do, I took Xi'er for a visit to the Great World. As soon as we entered, Xi'er wanted me to lead the way to get some floral water, as if it could be easily obtained. I smiled and followed his intention, searching for the testing area until we reached the roof of the fourth floor. We saw a large lion, behind which people were swarming. This was the testing area. The lion was about thirty feet long, made of gold, squatting and raising its head, majestic and extraordinary. Its eyes were made of spotlights, which could shine far away. The so-called "eyes like lightning" was no exaggeration. The lion's head slowly turned, and its eyes immediately moved to shine on various places. The mane on its neck fluttered in the wind. Its mouth opened and closed, as if it were about to leap up. Compared to the real lions kept in iron cages below, it was like a minor shaman seeing a great shaman. The skill was truly amazing. To take the test, one had to get a test form from a small window. The competition for the forms was so fierce that it could be a picture of the struggle of life. I used all my strength to get one. Following the crowd, I moved a few steps to where a board was hanging behind the electric light. The board was divided by black lines. Almost all kinds of objects were hanging inside the lines, such as various fruits, various daily necessities, and also miniature objects like candle stands, wardrobes, washstands, dressing tables, etc. They were all commonly seen objects that everyone could recognize, but it still took some effort to collect them. It was said that each time there were twenty kinds of objects displayed. The lights were bright, and those who could quickly remember could record everything they saw, and they could write everything down on paper. But to fill in all twenty kinds without error was almost impossible without an extraordinary brain. On average, people could remember seven or eight kinds. Those who were clever could get fifteen or sixteen kinds, which should not be difficult to achieve. Fortunately, there were gifts for those who got more than five kinds correct, so the bar was not set too high. Those who entered the treasure mountain would not return empty-handed. Xi'er and I each participated twice and both got gifts. This confirmed that my eyesight and memory were not too bad. Considering the crowding when getting the form, I stopped there. I never saw anyone who got all twenty kinds correct. It was said that since the beginning, only one or two people had gotten them all correct. After a while, I realized that this was an advertisement for Jiufu New Medicine's Bulido. Whether eyesight and memory are sound is related to the strength of the body. Bulido is a new tonic that has a very effective effect on those whose eyesight and memory are declining and whose bodies are weakening. The huge lion also symbolizes that after taking Bulido, one can be as powerful as a lion. The country of sleeping lions should be treated with a lion's strength tonic.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>I previously read in your esteemed publication an article entitled "A News Reporter Gets Swindled" by a writer named Hubin Sanren. It described how I was swindled out of money by a certain Li. I was very surprised to read it. After investigating, I found that this matter was entirely fabricated. I was sick in bed at the time and did not have time to make a statement, which I regret. I am now writing this letter to you and respectfully request that you publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" section of your esteemed publication to correct the record. With utmost respect, I remain,</p>

<p>The Inside Story of the Increasing Number of Unemployed Workers in England (Part 2)</p>
<p>By Li Liuzeng, sent from Paris</p>
<p>Many political commentators in England are now loudly revealing the true reason for the rapid increase in the number of unemployed, which politicians are reluctant to admit. What is the real reason? It is the abuse of unemployment relief by the public. The Times has even publicly stated that the Labor government's Unemployment Insurance Act of 1930 has exacerbated this unfortunate phenomenon and bankrupted the unemployment fund. The act made it easier for unemployed workers to receive unlimited relief and reduced their enthusiasm for seeking work. For millions of workers, accepting charity has become a habit. The government relief, which they did not pay for before but can now receive, has been recognized by these millions of people as a right.</p>
<p>In fact, according to current regulations, anyone who has paid into the insurance fund for at least thirty weeks at any time in the past or who has paid into the insurance fund for at least eight weeks (two months) in one hundred and four weeks (two years) is eligible to receive unemployment relief. The workers who receive unemployment relief usually do not earn much when they are working. Therefore, when receiving unemployment relief, they cannot help but calculate the difference between the amount they earn when working and the amount of relief they are entitled to receive when not working. They calculate whether the difference is worth the hard work. The result of the calculation is often that it is more profitable not to work.</p>
<p>Of course, in other respects, relief payments are necessary for the majority of workers who are unable to live once the industry that sustains their livelihood comes to a standstill. In areas with the highest unemployment rates, such as coal mining areas and weaving areas, and in industrial areas in the north and central regions, coal miners who have lost their jobs due to declining exports and closed coal mines, and textile workers who are working half-days or are completely unemployed due to the shrinking scope of the textile industry, cannot easily move elsewhere to use their arms. It is impossible to criticize these types of workers for receiving relief payments. But the amount of relief is also alarming. The average coal miner receives unemployment relief that is only one or two shillings less than their weekly wages. Some are even equal. These are truly workers who are profiting without labor.</p>

<p>Chapter 14: Green Bamboo Sheds Tears, the Beauty's Heart Is Broken; Red Lotus Loses Its Fragrance, the Young Woman's Soul Departs</p>
<p>Cuiyun's stepmother had a matchmaker friend. Her name was Sister Axiu. She was also from Kunshan. She traveled between Shanghai and Kunshan. In the eyes of people in the Kunshan villages and towns, she was a beautiful woman. At that time, the Shanghai-Nanjing train had not been built, and people traveled by boat. When she arrived in the countryside, she described Shanghai as if it were heaven. The villagers were so fascinated that their saliva hung down three feet long. In fact, what was Sister Axiu's business? She was actually a water peddler and matchmaker. When she came to Wu the silversmith's house, she saw that the girl who had been called in, Cuiyun, was slender and outstanding. She had already taken note of her. She constantly provoked Cuiyun's stepmother. Moreover, at that time, Wu the silversmith was going through a bad patch. Even the silversmith's shop was gradually becoming unsustainable. He was also a little afraid of this second wife. If the couple argued, the woman's voice was louder than his, and he would give in. After a long time, he had to obey her in everything. People in the villages and towns said that Wu the silversmith was useless and that marrying this broom star had ruined the family. Sister Axiu seemed to be haunted. When she arrived in Kunshan, she was constantly thinking of Cuiyun. She knew that Wu the silversmith's situation had been bad recently, and his family was in trouble. She sent some things and borrowed some money. Then she mentioned taking Cuiyun to Shanghai. In fact, Sister Axiu and Cuiyun's stepmother had long been in agreement. The stepmother was willing to get rid of the thorn in her side as soon as possible. She was only afraid that her father would not agree. Later, when the opportunity was ripe, she was not afraid that her father would not agree. She took Cuiyun away. Cuiyun was only a twelve or thirteen-year-old girl at that time. Under the whip of her stepmother at home, there was no good. Listening to Aunt Axiu's description of Shanghai as if it were heaven, she naturally wanted to go to heaven to see it. Some people say that ghosts who died by hanging are always looking for a substitute, always taking advantage of people's times of disappointment, and luring them to heaven. Where is that heaven? They make a circle with a belt, like a moon cave. Inside the circle are fairy mountains and pavilions, all kinds of fascinating things. You just have to put your head into the circle. They quickly tighten the belt around your neck. In an instant, heaven becomes hell. At this moment, Cuiyun was tricked into Shanghai, which is this realm. Sister Axiu is a ghost who died by hanging, looking for a substitute, setting up a trap, and creating all kinds of scenes in Shanghai. A mirage. It's more than a fairy mountain and pavilion. You only have to set foot on the Bund and stretch your neck to take a look. It's as if a rope has cut off your throat. When you haven't arrived in Shanghai, it looks like heaven. When you've been tricked into Shanghai, you fall into hell. In less than a few months, Sister Axiu sold her to the brothel. It was called "pledging the account." The pledge was for ten years. Fortunately, she and her stepmother were in contact. Anyway, she wasn't her own flesh and blood. Sister Axiu gave her a few dollars, and she was already satisfied.</p>

<p>The Gold Market Turns Around, Progresses, and Morale Is Slightly Optimistic, Changes Still Peaceful</p>
<p>Yesterday, September 1st, the gold market suddenly showed a high soaring trend, but the overall market situation was still peaceful. The price fluctuated by only one or two taels throughout the day. There were more than five taels of differences. The wind and waves initially seemed to be calming down. However, morale was trending upward, and the foreign exchange market showed signs of tightening. Posted prices did not change, but supply and demand among dealers varied. In the morning, Yuan Cheng, Yong Tai, Kang Run, and others made purchases, while Yuan Mao Yong and small accounts sold. From early morning, although silver bars were priced high, there were many buyers, and the price quickly rose to the 60 tael mark. After that, sellers were also active and in a daze, so they were unable to continue raising prices and retreated by two or three taels. Later, Cui Tai, Yuan Sheng, Fu Chang, and others all made purchases, while sellers were scattered. The market initially opened flat, then slightly trended upward, but fluctuated around 60 taels. As for large bars, the telegram on the day before yesterday (August 31st) was slightly longer, with the silver price unchanged by one-sixteenth, but the exchange rate had increased by one-sixteenth. The gold price opened high, then sellers were in a daze. The opening price for gold in October immediately rose 2.8 yuan to 555.3 yuan, and then added another 5 yuan. However, Yu Da and others sold, immediately reducing the price to 54.6 yuan. After entering the market, buyers saw the strength and jumped up 3 yuan, totaling 57.7 yuan. As the prime rate was announced unchanged, Yuan Cheng and others sold off, reducing the price to 6.34 yuan. Before long, the price gradually rose by three or four taels. The exchange rate was strong, with the English gold bank making interbank transactions for October at 7 pence 4375, and Mitsui offering US dollars at 39.5 yuan. Yuan Cheng and Tai Kang Run bought in, reaching 60.02 yuan around 10 o'clock. Afterwards, various firms' sentiments softened, and suppliers became active, gradually moving downward, losing three taels to 57.1 yuan at 10:45. Then, Cui Tai and others bought in, raising the price by more than two taels to 59.78 yuan after 11 o'clock. However, the market was confusing and chaotic, and the price was again reduced by two taels to 57.7 yuan at noon. The closing price at noon was 58 yuan. The posted price was still 622.2 yuan, a small reduction of 66 yuan, and it only leveled off when it reached 64 yuan. After that, it slightly rose back to 6.6 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon at 57.9 yuan, then 7.6 yuan. Yuan Cheng, Yong Zhi Feng, Yong, and others bought in, and the Indian silver market slightly rebounded, so the price had already increased by two taels. Fu Chang and others likely also disposed of their holdings, so the price rose to 60.01 yuan at 2:45. The exchange market was also strong, with Mitsui buying December US dollars at 39.6875, and also buying Dalian October at 1.225. Later, people's sentiments were unstable, and supply and demand in the market were divergent, so prices also tended to drift, sometimes fluctuating by one or two yuan. By 4 o'clock, it was 58.7 yuan. Finally, there were only two or three qian of ups and downs, and the market closed at 4:30 at 59.1 yuan, a rebound of 6.6 yuan compared to last Saturday after many days of decline. It was found that the highest price of the day was 60.02 yuan and the lowest price was 54.6 yuan, a difference of 5.6 yuan. Looking back at the posted price, there was a reduction of sixty-three or four taels. The account book showed a filling of 69 taels to 58 taels, and a water replenishment of 69 taels. In the afternoon, it was 70 taels. It was said that yesterday (September 1st) happened to be when the exchange started to settle the public orders for September that had not been cleared, with the October orders being settled in cash by both long and short positions according to regulations. It was heard that there were about 2,000 orders, with the long positions mostly being Guang Bang, Heng Xing, Yu Feng Yong, etc., and the short positions being Jin An, Yuan Xing, Yong Tong Feng Yong, etc. The goods' opening price in the morning was 5.5 taels, the noon closing was 8 taels, the afternoon opening was 7.9 taels, and the closing price was 9.3 taels. Supply and demand were inconsistent, and there was a lack of wholesale volume. The transactions of various firms such as Zhi Feng Yong, Da De Cheng, Yu Da, Yuan Xing Yong, Sen Chang Yong, and Yuan Kang Xiang were unstable, sometimes buying and sometimes selling. Tai Kang Run, Yuan Cheng Yong, Cui Tai, Fu Yu, etc. were all buying, while Wan Xing, Yuan Mao Yong, and Heng Xing were selling. In the afternoon, Yuan Cheng Cui Tai and Tai Kang Run were all buying, while Yuan Da Yong Yi Yu and small accounts were all selling. The volumes of the various firms were mostly small. Transactions by the Dalian gang were quiet, with only five or six hundred orders sold and two hundred orders bought. The Guang bang also sold only one or two hundred orders.</p>

<p>A Brief Overview of the Dismembered Chaotic Market Situation</p>
<p>Recently, the foreign cent market has been characterized by sluggish use, and both supply and demand parties, in addition to mutually settling exchange head orders, do not engage in formal transactions and sales commissions. As a result, prices have slightly softened. However, the underlying foundation is stable, and it is unlikely that there will be a sharp decline in the short term. The silver market has reached a state of extreme looseness and abundance. However, with the reopening of the currency factory and the increasing demand for raw materials, there may be a glimmer of hope for a turnaround. But currently, there is no good outlook.</p>
<p>Dismembered Price "Foreign Cent" The price of foreign cent felt slightly sluggish in the early market, and the closing price was 7 qian 2 fen 8 li 8 hao 7 hu half, a continuation of the small decline of 2 hao half from the early market of the previous day. The afternoon market was even weaker by 1 hao 2 hu half, at 7 qian 2 fen 8 li 7 hao half. Looking at the current market situation, there do not seem to be any special changes.</p>
<p>"Silver Dismemberment" Silver dismemberment was 2 fen in the early market. The fact that white borrowing was available in the afternoon market shows the current looseness of silver dismemberment and the lack of hope for a turnaround. Head scratching and bank posting are still not open, and head support is abundant with no one asking about it.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions Jiangnan Small Foreign Coin remained at 6 qian 4 fen 7 li in the early market, the same as the previous afternoon. Only 1,000 jiao were transacted. In the afternoon market, due to the complete absence of transactions, the market price was no one competing, so it was the same as the early market.</p>
<p>Guangdong Small Foreign Coin fell back again yesterday. The early market was 6 qian 2 fen 4 li half, and the afternoon market was 6 qian 2 fen 4 li 2 hao half. The result was a total decline of 3 li 2 hao half from the early market of the previous day. 95,000 jiao were transacted in the early market and 15,000 jiao in the afternoon market.</p>
<p>Copper coins continued to rise by 1,500 wen, totaling 393,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Foreign Coin Inflow and Outflow "Silver Funds" The bank opened on Monday, so collections were tight. Chinese merchants collected 320,000 to 330,000 in draft funds, foreign merchants collected 270,000 to 280,000 in draft funds, and a total of 500,000 to 600,000 was collected for end-of-month settlement and sorting. Over 100,000 was collected for special funds, and over 1,010,000 was collected for various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous funds. 1,000,000 was released from the warehouse, and 500,000 was entered into the warehouse. Japanese banks collected 5,400,000 to 5,500,000 in various funds, and 800,000 was released from the warehouse. Qianzhuang and Yin Gong collected over 39,000,000 in single accounts, and over 440,000 in head scratching funds. Over 1,500,000 was collected for various exchange funds, over 100,000 was collected in cash, and 1,000,000 was deposited.</p>
<p>Strong and Weak Foreign Funds Exchange Draft Funds 1,750,000 was transacted in the early market and 924,000 in the afternoon market. No transactions were made in either market for banknotes. 170,000 was transacted outside the market in the early market and 141,000 in the afternoon market.</p>
<p>New Currency 100,000 plus was traded. Early Market Inter-Market of Bank traded 600,000, Afternoon Market Inter-Market of Bank traded 550,000, Over 1,400,000 was traded in foreign accounts of various banks, 200,000 plus in banknotes were collected and issued.

<p>Hangzhou Currency Factory Scheduled to Open Approximately Three or Four Days. Yesterday, silver bars and present treasure were transported to the Hangzhou Mint. The furnace had been stopped since June due to the low foreign cent and internal reorganization, lasting several months. It was originally intended to restart work last month, but due to the large amount of raw silver bars being shipped to the export factory, the factory had no way to procure raw materials, resulting in a delay until now. According to financial circles, the silver market has been unusually loose recently. Although large bars are not very abundant, present silver is still sufficient. Therefore, a resolution has been reached by financial circles and permission has been obtained from the factory to negotiate and determine that casting will begin between the 3rd and 4th of this month, and the raw materials required will continue to be supplied by the Shanghai silver market. It is predicted that new coins will be circulating in the Shanghai market in three or four days, and the cent price can be expected to loosen.</p>
<p>Securities The 19-year cigarette tax has opened, and bond prices are fluctuating. There is a slight continuous decline compared to before, and the market is still good, with 1,300,000 transacted. Yesterday, the securities exchange resumed full four-session transactions before and after the market, and also opened the sale of 19-year cigarette tax treasury bond futures. Both September and October contracts have been opened. Looking at the overall market situation throughout the day, although spot transactions continued to be few, futures remained strong. As for the trend of various bond prices, the market sentiment is still hesitant due to the chaotic environment, so prices are also chaotic. The result was that the Customs October contract and the Disarmament spot contract both rose by one yuan and several jiao compared to last weekend. The continuous large September contract rose by three yuan and four jiao compared to mid-last month due</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau held its 163rd bureau affairs meeting the other day. The director reported that (1) the municipal primary schools have started, and most of the situations have been handled properly, but schools such as Shangwen and Xijiang have requested additional classes, but due to limited funds, they could not be expanded as much as possible. The situation in municipal middle schools is also better than before. The first phase of the rural normal school has exceeded the quota, and there are currently 56 students. The later phase has also recruited enough students. Jingye Middle School's old dormitory could not accommodate the increased number of students, so a separate dormitory was set up outside the school. Many candidates applied to Wubu Middle School. Many candidates also applied to the newly established Yangjing Junior High School this year, but it is limited to only forty students. Wusong Middle School reduced a class, so many students could not be admitted. (2) In terms of social education, the plans for the people's schools and supplementary schools have been announced, but it will inevitably be difficult to implement due to reduced funding. However, social education work is inherently difficult, and we must work even harder. This intention should be encouraged in various schools. The bureau plans to run a people's school with bureau staff as teachers to show its promotion. It is proposed to submit it for discussion today. (3) The city government has approved the library funding. The people's reading newspaper and magazine agency will open after the budget is approved. (4) In terms of teaching research, the educational statistics for the 18th year should be carried out as soon as possible. (5) The supervision department has two urgent matters to handle: one is to conclude the past work, and the other is to convene a supervision meeting in the near future to discuss future work. (6) The reference room hosted by the Fifth Department is now decorated and ready. Director Tang is requested to send staff to arrange the display immediately. (7) The library has also begun to be arranged. Then, the following were discussed: (1) A proposal to delete the word "female" from the names of girls' schools. It was decided that municipal primary schools should be co-educational, and the word "female" should be removed. Private primary schools should not be restricted. (2) A proposal to issue a notice to private primary and secondary schools to pay attention to hygiene matters. The method was revised and passed and a notice was issued to all schools to comply with it. (3) A proposal to establish a people's school attached to the bureau. It was decided to pass it and hand it over to the Fourth Department to draft a method and submit it to the director for approval and implementation. (4) A proposal to organize a phonetic alphabet promotion committee. It was decided to pass it and the members would be appointed by the director.</p>
