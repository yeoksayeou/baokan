<p>劉世芳起謂本律師辯護方面與汪律師同現在分三部份來謂（一）高英販土部份（二）高廖氏販土部份（三）高英凟職部份現在先說高英販土部份（一）事實上對高廖氏行李内帶有鴉片高英當然知情辯駁（甲）高英雖爲廖氏之夫但第一不能因夫妻關係即斷定其爲知情第二並無證據可以證明伊等夫婦事前接洽情形因高英未與其妻同行其間且無信電可爲明證（乙）封條問題係高英預給廖氏一點在第一審即爲認定之事實但此全係錯誤第一據辯護人接到領事館的電報此項封條並無領事館的印第二由舊金山寄來的照片上看箱子上所貼的也不像封條至於說這封條是外交部發的現在也巳經查明外部並未發交封條與駐外使領館預存據是則高英何來此種封條預給廖氏又外交部原有封條非經駐外使領館員請領向不發給高英在事前並未回國何能領就查高廖氏十七年回國之時外交部亦證明彼等無請領封條之事可見封條問題高英和廖氏都没有請領的第三箱上封條略成方形其上並無領館圖章據外部復文稱實與普通印刷品無異故本案關於封條部份根本不能爲成立罪名的證據（丙）廖氏到金山碼頭的時候高英以夫婦關係前往迎接亦屬人情之常（丁）高英在行李被扣之後即電伍公使報告箱内有少數毒物一點係高英聽哈里土史密史說後所以知道的並非他事前先知哈里士史密史二人皆係金山海關毒樂部主任所以高英聽得他們說箱内有毒藥消息之後即信其無訛所以當即電伍公使報告情形（戊）至於說高英向伍公使乞援一點也有數種理由第一烟爲國體有關第二夫婦相助人情之常第三高英報告時態度正大電内有「或運送鈞處查騐」可見並無私心第四他和伍公使同具愛國苦心在七月七日伍公使給他的電報内說「宜由執事逕向海關交涉免騐運回中國旣不入境當可辦到如辦不到用電告知」照此看來伍公使亦有庇護嫌疑嗎據龔總領事稱高英夫婦堅拒宣露土販姓名全非眞相第一因高龔不睦這孫垣在第一審時巳經供過又金山總領事館律師顧問　爾來函稱亦證明龔與高英意見不和所龔總領事在事後曾說南京方面對偷運鴉片處分有極嚴厲之法律故高英夫婦此次運烟至少將受無期徒刑處分其誣衊態度溢於言表可見他對高英意氣用事之深了（龔之言論係據金山民國日報去年七月十三日載其與外報記者之談話）以上事實方面皆可證明高英無販土之行爲次說高廖氏販土部份高廖氏現年僅二十四歲智識經騐均屬幼稚且生長於外交家庭常常游歷交際廣闊對於人情世故未嘗措意所以說他有販土的胆識殊未可信因爲他年稚識淺好騖交際所以陳生夫婦於宴會席上認識後即不追究他的住址而且携帶禮物係屬平常之事當陳生託他帶行李的時候說抵埠後有人來領取廖氏無庸顧問則廖氏自難推託不與携帶因爲這些行李廖氏多未經手所以件數和鎖匙等等他都未知直到船過檀香山後塡寫報單時候廖氏旣未知箱内藏有遠禁品當然照章塡寫並没有分别自己物件和他人託帶的十一件至於箱上所貼封條廖氏旣未領取當由陳生僞造無疑由上述推論下來廖氏運土的證據殊不充分現在再有四點可資反證第一廖氏自知領館人員的行李並無絶對免騐的權利所以决不會做這樁事的第二十一件行李廖氏始終未嘗親自檢點過故關員囑伊指出伊確不能（見金埠西報記載）第三廖氏自己三件上並無封條第四搜出信件均係固封廖氏何從知其内容（見案内西報記載）照此四點看來更足證明廖氏無運土行爲不過廖氏上這個當也由疏怱過失得來依刑法第二十五條過失應處罰者以有特别規定者爲限廖氏旣由疏怱得罪當無處罰之理至本案在法律方面的研究可分两點來說（一）新禁烟法不能援用因本案發生在新禁烟法未頒之前自無援用之可能所以本案仍應援用舊禁烟法或刑法二百七十一條行爲時之法律之規定但本案高廖旣未製造亦未販賣或意圖販賣（玉賢深光致壽南信内云此貨俱是深光兄之貨）則此二點都不成立至於運輸乃照刑法第二百七十一條加有限制「自外國輸入或輸出外國均須與本國有關方成罪案」現高廖氏從香港到美國旣非中國領土何得成罪依刑法第一條「行爲時之法律無明文科以刑罰者其行爲不爲罪」之規定高英與高廖氏實俱無罪現在再退一步說即有法條可援進而研究共犯問題（甲）正犯凡事前敎唆及於實施犯罪行爲之際或直接爲重要之帮助者均謂之正犯（乙）從犯就是帮助正犯的現在就高英方面說他不是正犯正犯温玉賢及深光等其理由如次（一）因高英事前並無唆深光玉賢等販賣烟土的證據（二）高英並未在犯罪行爲之際爲直接及主要之帮助這因爲高英始終未離美國無從帮助玉賢深光等在香港辦貨次就從犯方面說高英亦非從犯因爲他並無普通帮助正犯的行爲假使說高英此次舉動姑當他有帮助高廖氏的嫌疑則高廖氏當爲正犯但高廖氏帶的烟土旣非爲他所有即不能成爲正犯且高英事前亦無敎唆廖氏之證據亦並未施行任何帮助的行爲如領取外交部封條及給與方形之印刷品等類至於電伍公使乞援問題這完全係事後的行爲且因夫婦關係亦即人情之常如刑法一百七十七條親屬圓利犯人或依法逮捕拘禁之脫逃人而有本條（即藏匿犯人及湮滅證據罪）之罪者免除其刑所以高英乞援一節亦無構成本案犯罪嫌疑之可能至於高廖氏照上面所說他也不是正犯（一）因爲他没有敎唆玉賢深光販賣的證據（二）於實施犯罪行爲之際無直接及重要之帮助請申述之第一若說高廖氏是正犯須證明他確知深玉賢等有販賣之意第二他的帮助與實施行爲須證明他有推銷鴉片之行爲但這鴉片是由深光玉賢等推銷的高廖氏在運輸上不過普通之帮助故不成爲主犯至多是一個從犯而巳然而高廖氏代運烟土之行爲其實情祗能爲過失犯依刑法第二十七條「凡人雖非故意但按其情節應注意並能注意而不注意爲過失犯過失犯無特别規定者無罪」之規定則高廖氏實無罪可說本律師認本辯護理由充足請求撤消原判予以無罪再述高英凟職部份在質的方面是可以調查的如期約賄賂當然有事實可證俣本案是由陳以一的意思搆成的高英在他的回電中早有反對的表示不能再說他是有期約的至於報酬三千陳得四之一高得四之三後來又由二四加以二六都是陳以一作的主張高英是没有參預（讀高致陳電）陳以一是外交官他在墨西加利做領事所以他在外交方面的情形很明白他招得梅光等四人到美國去護照由他代辦一面約高英在美接引說定如何如何酬勞並說酬金等這四人到美後即可交付但後來四人到埠因護照不合被移民局扣留並在四人身上檢查就中祇有一人帶了二十美金其餘並無銀錢照此看來陳以一約高英的賄賂行爲豈不是根本不成立嗎所以原判說他是期約賄賂及凟職罪也是不能成立的本辯護人根據上述理由請庭上撤消原判予以無罪（李宗謙胡震關於孫垣之辯論均請維持原判從略）</p>

<p>全塲經過</p>
<p>上半時形勢尙見精彩後衞李天生及右翼曹桂成時有極佳之表演頗得觀衆之讚美餘子亦俱出色但以缺少聨絡未能盡如人願下半時中曹桂成孫思敬陳鎭和三人未出場由梁彦贊代孫馮運佑代陳陳光耀調任右翼葉北華任左翼形勢益趨平淡頗少精彩可言</p>
<p>努力加鞭</p>
<p>觀昨日之表演成績雖可樂觀然尙須勤加訓練則此次遠東錦標必可言穩全體選手於今晨東度預料抵日本後距大會開幕日期尙有多日務須努力加鞭勤加操練冀得保持吾國常勝軍之盛名願各勉之</p>
<p>先下强手</p>
<p>昨日之戰原定下午四時開始因西捕到場稍遲列陣交鋒巳四有半國軍先發制人孫錦順陳光耀聨合進攻陳光耀傅球西捕門前陳家球打門甚急西捕手忙脚亂罔知所措不料事有湊巧球觸西捕史欲脫腿上彈出界外曹桂成踢主角球落點甚佳未能奏效</p>
<p>孫破紀錄</p>
<p>一刻鐘後西捕忽逞兇猛向國軍門前猛力壓迫幸内衞措置得法解危爲安李寗將球送至前方陳家球裁得撥至右邊曹桂成帶球衝追至適當地點傅送西捕門前孫錦順趁勢一脚對門射云正中要害國軍乃勝一球</p>
<p>两翼建功</p>
<p>勝負雖分形勢依然未見緊張戴麟經得陳光耀交下之球還交孫錦順孫得球撥過防線逼近西捕門前巳入無人之境觀衆以爲反掌可以立功無奈操之過急脚頭略斜未能命中當二十五分鐘時戴麟經傅球與曹桂成曹帶球疾馳而進用高球傅至西捕門前不料球正落入西捕門之左角遂又勝一球喜出望外此後西捕在國軍門前得一極好機會但打門未中相差毫釐觀衆大受驚嚇相戰良久陳光耀得曹桂成傅下之球亦建奇功國軍乃以三比零勝上半時</p>
<p>敵勢忽盛</p>
<p>休息以後易陣趣戰國軍陣線大有調動實力大减竸爭興趨頗爲平淡西捕聲勢忽盛興兵進攻國軍門前危險頻逞有一次周賢言跑出救球未着球球彈向門去梁彦贊趕回坐鎭將球頂出線外權以退兵啞克萊角球甚佳西捕乘勢追殺卒未奏效</p>
<p>最後勝負</p>
<p>戰至一刻鐘時西捕又雄兵追上國軍中線失手後方忽逞空虚透納得球對門遠射竟然命中西捕乃開紀錄成三與一之比人後西捕活根生又中一球觀衆乃爲國軍担憂全塲形勢忽變對於國軍大爲鼓勵果然在最後幾分鐘間葉北華打中一球結果遂成四與二之比國軍勝裁判員李思廉</p>
<h3>日本對於游泳比賽的預測</h3>
<p>謂彼必獲錦標我國全無希望</p>
<p>望我選手努力雪恥</p>
<p>東京通訉日本出席遠東大會游泳隊監督白山源三郎氏昨對記者作關於此次大會錦標之談話如下</p>
<p>第九次遠東大會的游泳比賽要在日本體育史上佔最要的一頁因爲一是神宮游泳池的開幕二是日本雪恥的紀念和新紀錄的産生日本的必勝是誰也不能有些許懷疑的也决不能因上屆在上海的惜敗而作任何不利於日本的推測一九二七年在上海舉行八次大會時正值全美竸泳大會也在夏威夷舉行日本因被招待遂遣送第一流選手高石等數名出席當時注意國際的大會而又不放過入世界舞臺的機會措置之苦心也算得當日本毅然的推薦些第二流選手參加遠東大會也有至理一則日木選手過多平時第二流以下的選手難得對外比賽的機會借此使他們得着經騐是有益前途的二則他們的勝利是證明日本水泳界可怕的進步增長日本的自信心不幸一班新進的中等選手到底實力較弱加以審判不公使之减興結果僅以少數之差而惜敗了</p>
<p>此次大會日本的優勝是絶對的是十分痛快的决没有因分數之爭而演出激烈竸爭的事祗有看日本選手的優良表演是值得特别注意的要說二百米平泳與五十米自由泳是大會的唯一精彩也非過言日本此項選手能與世界名選手抗衡者有數名之多菲律賓則只有伊魯福郎一人中國竟無此種人才五十米自由泳一項素難預測每因些許不同的情况而影響其成績此次也許有意外驚人的創作加之五十米從來是菲律賓得意的所以我國也不能太樂觀了二百米是同樣的也非相當的注意不可</p>
<p>敎部贈送大會之銀爵</p>
<p>（王開攝）</p>
<p>鶴出君的二百米平泳可寫寫意意的冠軍是衆人所公認的他的紀錄是二分四五秒菲島預選時伊魯福郎氏是二分五十二秒四也不可忽視伊氏有感寒的弱點鶴出氏則起步失之遲緩但鶴出氏的實力特别充足即使他在練習時不能勝伊氏取得决賽的冠軍則易於探囊現可在幻想到决賽時鶴出氏飛步在前隨著有馬渡松本勝田粟田或塚原原岡島總之計　流選手將包圍伊氏而演出熱烈的競爭結果也許伊氏得第二或落爲第四至少有一人是伊氏第二終點的强敵</p>
<p>五十米自由泳中菲島第一烏魯加氏的成績時二八秒二所以說日本没有可慮的宮本益田早川的成績皆在二十七秒左右神宮賽時宮本是二七秒六（預選是二十七秒四）益田二十七秒六早川二十七秒八高石佐田及其他能士雖難有保持二十六秒左右的成績者但平均二七秒四是不成問題的如此烏氏的成績决不足道二百米絶力賽也是最有興味的也能演出非常來</p>
<p>其次的問題在百米背泳菲培羅比氏的成績是一分十六秒二他以下的概可想見了以成績論入江氏之執此項牛耳不待而言（按人江氏前年出席出界大會獲百米背泳第四他的紀錄是一分十三秒二）神宮預選會巳確定此次出席大會的片山氏是一分十七秒六松村一分十八秒六大島一分十九秒六木村一分十七秒四大本一分十八秒六其他松村大槻等也有可觀的記錄去歲東西中等學校對抗競技時片山的成績是一分十六秒六此次與塔氏作第二之爭的競敵自然是片山氏了</p>
<p>張學良送贈之大銀杯三只</p>
<p>（王開攝）</p>
<p>百米自由泳選手巳指定的有高石宮本村上佐田諸氏當初居第三位的宮本氏的成績現巳進步到一分二秒六若烏魯加氏的成績來與日選手一同排列不過落在第九名其餘的菲選手更可不提了</p>
<p>四百米一千五百米更不待言結局是給中菲選手看一看日本的强勁罷了其次使人注意的就是日本去年冬季公開比賽以來選手們的實力了明大武村氏四百米以四分五十二秒的成績迫進了世界記錄二百米的成績是二分十七秒高石佐田也都是二分十七秒</p>
<p>最後關於公開比賽男子方面五十米百米千米各項自由泳二百米背泳四百米平泳都是此次未出大會各選手活躍用武的機會水泳王國的豪勢將要使全世界驚恐女子方面有五十米·百米·二百米·四百米的自由泳　百米二百米平泳日本都要意氣揚揚的</p>
<p>總而言之此次的優勝是屬日本無疑菲日間或有相當的烈戰中國的游泳實在大幼稚很難有活動的可能</p>

<h3>虞太夫人治喪瑣聞孫籌成</h3>
<p>上海商整會常務委員虞洽卿之母方太夫人於月之九日在三北龍山領帖滬杭京甬各埠前往執紼者數千人爰將見聞所及分誌如下以實自由談</p>
<p>途中狀况虞府距滬有數百里之遥交通本不便利此次因虞君布置妥洽尙稱便利先期分送證章船票與來賓在新江天與寗興二輪分設虞氏治喪辦事處以便招待八日下午五時两輪由滬啓輪次晨抵鎭海飭姚北慈北鎭北三輪將來賓駁至龍山碼頭攺乘虞君自備之小火車計行十分鐘抵龍山備有汽車二輛山轎四十人力車三十輛小船數十艘輪流分運至虞府沿途派人招待車轎夫役均穿虞府沿途派人招待而知</p>
<p>虞宅布置虞宅因此次來賓甚多特裝五千盞電燈之發電機及自來水無線電等門前高張白布天幔約長百餘丈两旁搭有四丈高彩樓两座上有鼓吹亭爲迎送來賓之用左爲泰平橋右爲天叙橋橋上均豎白綾三角大纛旗四面黑絨狗牙齒邊中有祭奠等大黑字臨風招展煞是好看幔下遍列萬民傘德政牌等祭堂旁懸有黨國要人蔣介石蔡元培于右任等之輓聨祭幛甚夥</p>
<p>弔客擁擠甬俗往弔者以備有祭文爲最恭敬此次國民政府江浙两省省政府上海熊司令張市長寗波楊市長王指揮以及縣長局長署長等有派代表前往者有親往執紼者故九日領帖各機關各團體之公祭自朝至暮從未間斷每一次公祭均由贊禮員司儀高唱大吹獻爵等名辭且須恭讀祭文故贊禮員與鼓吹手咸叫苦連天云</p>
<p>蒪話盛</p>
<p>日前因事赴江干順道游西湖舟抵柳岸聞鶯乃捨　　舟登陸時值午餐於樓外樓中有蓴羹一味極可口考蓴菜專産地不僅僅西湖耳如紹興之湘湖鑑湖嘉興之鴛湖吳興之菱湖餘杭之南湖以及蘇州之太湖均有之然以數處相比較則以西湖所出産者爲最佳　　晋代張季鷹思及蓴羹乃曰人生貴適志何能覊官數千里以要名爵乎自右傅爲佳話而其急流勇退之氣概洵乎不可及矣</p>
<p>蓴菜一名蒓菜又名水葵·菜作橢圓形有長柄莖葉間有粘液故用以製羹游西湖者盛道蓴羹之鮮美意者西湖上源水清瑩如鏡蓴之所受給養殆亦有所特異者歟</p>
<p>發引情形十日上午十時發引除普通儀仗外并有肉身燈提香爐孔雀亭小地戲等蓋三北舊俗每年本有賽會之舉自國民政府禁止後巳三年不舉行此次虞太夫人出殯附近各社因其生前能爲人排難解紛械鬥惡習得以革除人皆感激故咸集資加入以相送經虞興村龍頭塲等處所有儀仗有八九里之長沿途觀衆僉謂較以前賽會更盛</p>
<p>食宿問題此次弔客之多世所罕見龍興村向無客棧酒館故此次食宿二事最難解决酒菜由滬甬四廚房承辦除中菜外另設西菜部原定每日開六百桌旋因來賓超過預算每日須開一千桌人手不敷分两次開飯致後食者巳垂涎欲滴虞府房屋甚大佔地十餘畝原有床舖三百餘臨時添置行罼床一千隻每間設舖位十五床上被褥概用白色與醫院相仿其他保衞團等均宿地舖</p>
<p>小販獲利虞宅面臨小河可通餘姚周巷自九日起鄉僻小鎭頓形熱閙買棹而來艤舟如織水道爲之阻斷小販投機租船以供人宿搭棚而售酒飯致有水上公館臨時飯店等名稱其他如西洋景打拳頭賣綫粉水菓攤觸目皆是十日與十一两日由滬上中華公蘭社雅歌集律和等四票在虞府及虞氏家祠虞母專祠三處演劇以祝虞母九十冥壽故觀衆雲集小販獲利不少</p>

<h3>英國美術考察記汪亞塵自倫敦寄</h3>
<p>初春樹葉抽芽巴黎天氣從灰暗中巳見光明得友人倫敦函近有意大利名畫在倫敦美術學院展覽余約畫家吳恒勤於三月中旬抵倫巴黎來倫敦晨發夕至到後旬餘氣候晴朗連日參觀倫敦各博物館美術館及世界著名之建築目不暇接茲將美術上考察所得簡記於後</p>
<p>一·國立畫NationalGalery在倫敦市之中心隣近宮該館陳列名作四千餘點自文藝復興以降歐洲各國名作皆有精品陳列尤以收藏意大利·荷蘭·西班牙之作品爲最多近闢新陳列室一大間專懸掛文藝復興之繪畫數百點英國收藏之富可與法國並美</p>
<p>二·太帝美術館TaieGalery在倫敦市内建築宏麗爲各美術館之冠館内分陳繪畫二十五室除三間法國印象派之作品外餘皆英國近代乃至現代之名作範圍之大作品之多與上述國民畫堂彷彿余此行的專爲考察英人之繪盡故對於英人之繪畫略記於下以供國内同志之參考焉</p>
<p>英國之繪畫在十八世紀中葉即顯著現實之特色其時以自然主義在風景畫上創開新面目者有太納Turner與康司坦勃爾Conslablel一人之繪畫該館特别陳列數室當十八世紀初期之英國畫都尙因襲以自然爲對象之繪盡實創始於二人太納之作以描寫水蒸氣光與空氣之特色勝前期寫實後期寫意康司坦勃爾之作對自然用忠實之表現與太納目標雖同而技術各異近代歐洲現實派與自然派之繪畫實啟端於二人</p>
<p>在太納以前英國尙有两大畫家使吾人不能忘者即黎納爾特Reynolds與有甘司蒲羅Gainsborough在十八世紀初期英國之繪畫完全受意大利及和蘭作風的影響千張一例缺少變化惟黎氏之作雖繼承和蘭大家汪達克VanDyck之畫風但描寫上都以寫實爲主要絶不描寫文學與空想之題材黎氏留下肖像畫共四千餘幀表現力偉大可推英國人物畫家之第一人也</p>
<p>甘氏之作描寫森林擅長亦依自然爲歸彼之手法及觀照自然除法國風景畫家Corot以外無可匹敵今人常稱甘氏爲自然主義之師宜矣</p>
<p>太納以後英人創拉飛爾前派其中心人物爲羅司帝Rosselti羅氏文學家而兼畫家名作有「但丁之夢」該館列一大室計二十餘點專描幻想作風柔美偏於文學趣味太重繪畫本身之力量不免薄弱當時法國盛行浪漫主義羅氏之作其趣味可與法人特拉克Delacroix並稱然其技術之力量相差甚矣</p>

<p>文官處訓令責交數月來趙李爭端雙方各趨極點互不相讓及至本月初國府文官處據趙鐵橋之呈請即下令上海特别市市長張羣轉飭招商局董事兼積餘經理李國杰着將積餘地産尅日交給新經理如再違延即予法辦迨經市政府將此令轉行到積餘至本月五日李國杰允將所管之全部産據如數交出而趙鐵橋立即派員接收</p>

<p>招商局擴充所聞積餘公司巳接收招商局在經濟上巳可流通活躍而與擴充計劃實有聨帶的關係近日局中之辦事人員亦十分有興據聞該局之全部擴充爲添造船六萬餘噸並建新式洋樓而目前先認爲切要而急需第一步之擴充者係爲揚子江内之發展業務該局巳根據調查之結果先從長江上游如宜昌·湘潭·長沙·各路增造大批鐵駁及拖船以爲競爭上游航運之第一步日來己在打樣定建聞共先造二十餘艘云</p>

<h3>世界文學的故事（一）（五）（三）美國約翰瑪西著胡仲持譯</h3>
<p>第十八章十九世紀的法蘭西詩</p>

<p>Thursday (5)</p>
<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Japanese Parliament</h3>
<p>This special session of the Japanese parliament is called a shameful history of constitutionalism by the Japanese, but it is actually nothing more than a normal state of recent disputes. Since the European War, the outward appearance of civilization has been stripped away. Everything is seen naked. It is useless to resist the power of reason. If the power is not enough, then use wrist strength to take pleasure in a moment is common. Those who have military power available use military power to expand the role of their wrist strength is also common. In short, using all available power without any hesitation is the current state of naked struggle in the world.</p>
<p>People often talk about the struggle between the new and the old. In fact, the fiercest struggle between the new and the old is not the struggle between new and old ideas, nor is it the struggle between new and old methods, but the struggle between new and old forces. The metabolism of the new and old is the normal principle of things. If the new forces are born and the old forces do not retreat, how can the struggle be avoided? Moreover, the so-called old forces often regard the past glory, power, and influence as a gift and are determined not to lose it slightly. If it is lost once, they will do everything possible to seek restoration. Therefore, the struggle after the old forces are frustrated is often more reckless than the struggle when the new forces have not succeeded. The so-called ugliness in the Japanese parliament this time is also formed by this example.</p>

<h3>A Page of Ugly History in Japanese Constitutionalism</h3>
<p>A Punch Throws, and Raimaki is Seriously Injured</p>
<p>The Lights are Extinguished Twice as Politicians Fumble in the Dark</p>
<p>Parliament Opens Chaotic and Closes Chaotic</p>
<p>Domei, Tokyo, Fourteenth: The special parliament ended yesterday. These two weeks saw the House of Representatives end in chaos. At yesterday's final meeting, an inauspicious event occurred: Shiga Chitori of the Seiyukai party assaulted Raimaki Katsukichi of the Minseito party, causing serious injury. This is a page of ugly history in Japanese constitutionalism. Yesterday, the Seiyukai's economic resolution failed to be put on the agenda, and Ozaki Yukio's motion of censure against the government was not submitted for a vote, buried in obscurity. The Minseito party, relying on its majority, displayed its tyrannical state to the fullest extent. Enraged Seiyukai members vented their accumulated grievances in the punishment committee of Toubu and Aoki, leading to great chaos. The committee adjourned three times. During party discussions, someone twice extinguished the lights. In the darkness, people ran back and forth. When it came to the main meeting, Toubu, during questioning, demanded the Prime Minister's presence. When the Prime Minister went to the House of Peers, Raimaki Katsukichi and two other Minseito members were discussing the matter with three Seiyukai members. Suddenly, Shiga Chitori of the Seiyukai violently struck Raimaki in the back of the head. Raimaki, suffering from a chest hemorrhage, collapsed to the ground and was immediately carried to the in-house infirmary. The back of his head was swollen, and the injury was quite serious. Judge Matsuzaka, Prosecutor Ichihara, and Police Superintendent Maruyama, along with thirty others, rushed to the scene to investigate everything. Raimaki's wife also rushed to the infirmary and took him back to his residence. Shiga, in his excitement, vehemently argued that he used an empty hand and did not strike violently. The attending physician said that if it were an empty hand, he would not have sustained such a serious injury and that full recovery would take five months. The Minseito immediately held an executive meeting to discuss retaliatory measures, resulting in the filing of a complaint in the names of Harabufujiro and another against Shiga Watari, demanding the immediate exercise of judicial authority. At the same time, the punishment committee accused Toubu and Shoji Ryoro of the Seiyukai of disrupting official duties by stirring up trouble during the conference, using the name of Tsuchiya Seisaburo to sue the two for obstructing the execution of public duties. With Raimaki injured, the Seiyukai, filled with murderous intent, sent twenty representatives to Prime Minister Hamaguchi's office to negotiate. The militants of the Seiyukai's off-parliamentary group also broke into the parliament, and the situation became extremely unstable. Prime Minister Koizumi and Minister of Colonial Affairs Matsuda changed color and entered the Prime Minister's office. The Minseito's off-parliamentary group also mobilized to protect Prime Minister Hamaguchi. There were minor clashes between the two sides. As a result, only the three Seiyukai representatives, Hara Sohei and others, entered the Prime Minister's office to negotiate with the two Prime Ministers, Koizumi and Matsuda, strongly criticizing the party's inappropriate actions. During the chaos in the main meeting, members of the Kenkokukai in the gallery distributed dozens of leaflets with the inscription "Give bread to the unemployed." There were sighs everywhere about when the parliament's lack of order and politicians' lack of reflection could be improved. The 58th parliament closed amidst a tragic and chaotic atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Germany and France Begin Negotiations on the Saar Issue</h3>
<p>Italy Intends to Request France to Cede Lake Chad</p>
<p>Kokumin, Geneva, Thirteenth: The informal talks between the German and French foreign ministers regarding the Saar issue have attracted considerable attention here. Saar residents have elected representatives who arrived this morning to appeal to the League of Nations Administrative Council about the French intimidation of residents. It is claimed that French authorities are taking advantage of the current economic decline in the area to force German mine owners to send their children to French-language schools and distributing 100-franc banknotes to these students to lure them. In addition, they are putting pressure on employers to dismiss workers who come from Germany every morning. The German Foreign Minister, in addition to protesting these circumstances to Briand, is also protesting the French and Belgian authorities' lack of intention to fulfill their previous promise to withdraw the Saar region's railway, garrison troops, and Rhine garrison troops at the same time, demanding that all troops, regardless of their designation, be withdrawn. It is reported that Briand has already agreed to withdraw.</p>
<p>Kokumin, Paris, Thirteenth: According to an unexpected日內 news item, the Italian Foreign Minister is now asking France to cede Lake Chad to Italy. This move would be tantamount to severing the nerve center of France's vast African empire, hence the astonishment here upon hearing the news. It is said that according to the 1916 agreement, Italy must fulfill certain conditions. Since the conditions have not been met, how can they demand the lake? Therefore, many French political figures point out that this kind of Italian demand has no value for negotiation.</p>
<h3>Clash of Yellow and White Races</h3>
<p>Two Hundred Filipino Workers in Seattle</p>
<p>Attacked by Whites, Fleeing Empty-Handed</p>
<p>Japanese Livelihoods Greatly Affected</p>
<p>Seattle News: Ill feeling between Americans and Filipinos has been accumulating recently. On the 7th of this month, about 200 Filipino field workers in the White River area were suddenly attacked by a group of white laborers, fleeing empty-handed, forbidden to take their clothes and furniture, otherwise they would be shot. Upon hearing the news, the Seattle County Executive sent a team to suppress the violence, but the white workers had all fled, with only one arrested. The White River area is a concentration point for Japanese vegetable farmers. This incident has greatly affected the lives of the Japanese. The reason is that Filipino labor is cheap, and white workers are jealous, leading to this violent act (World News).</p>
<h3>Conditions in Sholapur Bleak After Martial Law Implementation</h3>
<p>Police Afraid to Report for Duty</p>
<p>Government Offices Unmanned</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, Thirteenth: Although assisted by soldiers, civil officials in Sholapur have ultimately failed to restore normal order. Unarmed police officers, having witnessed two of their colleagues being captured by the crowd on May 8 and burned alive, dare not report for duty. At the same time, government offices are unmanned, factories are closed, and there is no prospect of resumption. Civil officials, seeing this situation, decided to hand over management of the city to the military authorities. Yesterday afternoon, the Chief Magistrate hastily left the city, and all the soldiers in the city immediately returned to their posts. Nationalist leaders, believing that British rule had ceased from this point, issued a declaration yesterday, stating: "The British government has come to an end, and the Gandhi government has been established here. Europeans have abandoned their houses and left, the police have disappeared, the government offices are empty, and the courts have become scorched earth, with case files reduced to ashes. The traffic controllers at street corners are now officers of the Nationalist Congress. All of this is a sign that British rule no longer exists." Although there are soldiers parading in the streets, it is merely a futile display of the power of a dying regime. The above declaration was issued before the arrival of the troops and the declaration of martial law. However, from today onwards, martial law is implemented, and people are not allowed to carry weapons, fly the flag of the Nationalist Party, or gather in groups of more than four. Reuters, Bombay, Fourteenth: It is reported that 158 non-violent resistance volunteers were arrested when a team attacked the Shewla salt depot. Sixteen people were injured during the clash with the police.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Fourth Provisional Meeting of the National Government</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement is Approved According to the Opinion of the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>The fourth provisional state council meeting of the National Government was held at 3 pm on the 14th. The meeting was attended by committee members Lin Sen, Wang Chonghui, Hu Hanmin, Dai Fuxian, Tan Yankai, Chen Guofu, Sun Ke, and Zhu Peide. Chairman Tan Yankai discussed Legislative Yuan President Hu's presentation regarding Article 5 of the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement, which stipulates that the agreement shall take effect on the tenth day after the date of signing, which violates Article 25, Section 2 of the National Government Organization Law and should be questioned in accordance with the rules for the exercise of legal rights. The matter was discussed at the 88th and 89th meetings of the Yuan, and Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting attended to state his opinions. It was resolved to refer the matter to the Legal, Foreign Affairs, Financial, Economic, and Military Five-Committee for review. The committee then submitted its review report to the 90th meeting of the Yuan, and it was resolved that Article 5 of the agreement refers to the period during which its effectiveness takes place after it is submitted to the National Government for approval. Although the wording is too abbreviated, it does not violate any regulations. The tariff rates are also feasible within a reasonable period of time and should be approved. However, it should be solemnly declared that there should be no similar negligence in the wording of Article 5 in the future to prevent abuse. Furthermore, the competent authorities should be instructed to pay attention to the provisions of Article 25, Section 2 of the National Government Organization Law in the future to clarify responsibilities. In addition, special attention should be paid to the regulations of Articles 4 and 6 of the Party's foreign policy when convening a meeting of creditor representatives to sort out unsecured or insufficiently secured debts in Annex 4 of the agreement. Now, the case is recorded and submitted for review and implementation. The resolutions were: (1) Approve the agreement and ratify it. (2) Regarding Article 5, the text of the agreement should take effect on the tenth day after the date of signing. The competent authorities should be instructed not to have similar negligence in handling international events in the future, and the competent authorities should earnestly make a solemn declaration to prevent abuse. (3) The matters recorded in the exchanged notes of Annex 4 should be instructed to the competent authorities to pay close attention to the provisions of Articles 4 and 6 of the Party's foreign policy when convening a meeting of creditor representatives in the future. According to Article 25, Section 2 of the National Government Organization Law, the Legislative Yuan has the power to resolve legal cases, budget cases, amnesty cases, declarations of war, peace treaties, treaty cases, and other important international matters. Furthermore, according to Article 4 of the KMT's foreign policy, foreign debts borrowed by China should be guaranteed and repaid within the scope of not causing political or industrial losses to China. According to Article 6, the Chinese people are not responsible for repaying the foreign debts borrowed by irresponsible governments in China, such as the Beijing government, which was bribed, elected, or usurped power, because these debts were not used to improve the people's well-being but to maintain the position of warlords so that they could bribe, sell, invade, embezzle, and misappropriate these debts.</p>
<h3>After the Central Army's General Attack</h3>
<p>The Third Division Occupies Mamuji, and the Sun's Troops are Surrounded in Northern Anhui</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Central Army launched a general attack today (12th). The battle has begun. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>General Attack Order Issued: Chairman Chiang arrived in Xuzhou from Jinan yesterday (11th) at noon and met with Liu Zhi, Yang Jie, Jiang Chu'ou, and others to instruct them on military matters. The general attack order was issued that evening. Liu Zhi led the headquarters of the 12th Army Corps to Dangshan at 11 pm to supervise the battle. At 2 pm today, Yang Jie and Jiang Chu'ou also took an armored train to Dangshan to command the artillery team and armored train team to join the various units of the Second Army Corps and advance.</p>
<p>Recovery of Mamuji: The various units of the Second Army Corps on the Longhai Line, with the Third Division under Chen Jicheng in the front line of Liu Yangquan, and the artillery team under Xiang Zhizhuang, arrived last night to cover the Third Division's attack on Mamuji, one station west of Liu Yangquan. Although the trenches there are defensible, the number of Wan Xuancai's forward troops in that area is small. After one battle, they retreated. By noon, the Third Division had occupied Mamuji and telegraphed Xuzhou to report victory, stating that after occupying Mamuji, they were pursuing Guidet. Guidet is one station west of Mamuji and has no defensible terrain. It can also be captured within a day. The First Division is attacking west from Yucheng, and the Cavalry Brigade is advancing west from Xiayi, also making similar progress. Aircraft teams are taking off in large numbers from Dangshan to drop bombs. The armored trains, Great Wall, Beiping, Yungui, Huguang, and Tongyi, are jointly attacking. Materials trains have now gone west on the Longhai Railway to rush to repair the tracks and bridges to facilitate the advance.</p>
<p>Enemy Situation: The enemy troops had attempted to advance eastward in small groups since the 8th but were repelled by the Central Army. After a general attack by the Central Army, the front line has been shaken. The Jin troops in Lanfeng have moved east, and Guan Fu'an's division has arrived at Liuhe, deploying defenses behind Wan Xuancai's troops. Lanfeng has also deployed heavy defenses. It is heard that Sun Chu is currently in Lanfeng and Wan Xuancai is in Guidet. Zhang Fang, the former Director of Construction of Henan, came to Xuzhou to negotiate surrender for Wan. When Chairman Chiang passed through Xuzhou, he paid a visit and presented everything in person. Chiang sent a handwritten letter to Wan, delivered by a service member from the Second Army Corps headquarters to Guidet. Yesterday (11th), Zhang again visited Chairman Chiang. It is heard that Chiang was very understanding of Wan and instructed him to counterattack Yan and Feng as soon as possible to show his sincere attitude. As for the surrender of Sun Dianying, Sun's representative is still negotiating in Xuzhou. However, it is difficult to communicate due to poor communication. It has not been determined. Shi Yousan's troops are likely to contact Han Fuju. It is heard that Chiang has instructed Han to decide how to handle the matter. If he can show sincerity, Han will command him.</p>
<p>Northern Anhui Military News: There has been contact in the Bozhou area of Northern Anhui. According to military news, Wang Jun's Seventh Division and Yang Shengzhi's troops have approached Bozhou. Ye Kaixin's Fifty-second Division and Li Yunjie's Twenty-first Division have passed Zhoujiakou and surrounded Sun's troops. The battle situation is extremely favorable (12th).</p>
<h3>The War Between Henan and Anhui</h3>
<p>The Central Army Advances Towards Eastern Henan</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: After the Central Army came into contact with the Sun and Wan armies, the front lines of both sides expanded and have now entered a state of full engagement. The news received here is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Sun Dianying Destroys the Iron Bridge: Wan Xuancai's troops of the Longhai Railway have been advancing eastward since the evening of the 8th and are avoiding the railway line, focusing on the Yucheng area. The fighting is quite fierce. Sun Dianying, feeling the pressure on the railway line, destroyed the iron bridge about four miles east of Mamuji to prevent attacks by the Central Army's armored trains. The Jin side believes that the Wan and Sun troops are weak and has transferred several divisions of the Jin army to Lanfeng and Guidet to support them. The Central Army's Tenth Division: After Yang Shengzhi's Tenth Division of the Central Army came into contact with Sun Dianying's troops in the northern border of Woyang, the following information was received from the front: The Seventh Division of Sun's troops along the Zhao Wang River was fiercely attacked by Jiang Fusheng's 30th Brigade of Yang's Division on the 8th. The 28th Brigade under Gao Ji's portion also crossed the river from Shatuji to assist in the attack and captured the fortified stockades of Zhang Xinliugusi, seizing mortars, rifles, and a large amount of luggage. They then surrounded and attacked Zhu Zhaiwei. Li Bohua's 29th Brigade has advanced to the Sanguan Temple north of Guanyintang (Guanyintang is east of Bozhou) and launched a multi-pronged attack at dawn on the 9th.</p>
<p>Sun's Troops Mutiny in Bozhou: Sun Dianying's troops mutinied a few days ago. After opening fire with the Central Army, Yang Shengzhi's Tenth Division has bypassed Bozhou and cut off its rear. The Sun's troops in Bozhou City have no will to fight. Two battalions mutinied the day before yesterday. Only a small number of troops are defending Bozhou City.</p>
<p>Li Yunjie Advances to Lucheng and Taikang: Li Yunjie's newly formed Twenty-first Division of the Central Army has been actively advancing since capturing Feihekou. According to reports from the front, Sun's troops in the Lucheng and Taikang Daiyong areas of Eastern Henan have retreated north. Li's Division is now advancing in multiple directions towards Lucheng and Taikang to capture the two cities. The Fifty-second Division of the Eighth Army under Ye Kaixin has retreated towards Huaiyang after passing through Taihe (May 12th).</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Investigates the Wuchang Ship Soil Case</h3>
<p>Wang Xun Chang and Others Petition the County Government to Investigate</p>
<p>The Previous Transfer Did Not Include These Files</p>
<p>Rumors that Former County Chief Kong Resolved the Matter Through Bribery</p>
<p>The Current County Chief Petitions the Civil Affairs Department for Review</p>
<p>According to Wang Xun Chang, Li Jingcheng, Zhang Nanping, Yu Shaofu, and other citizens of Zhenjiang, the well-known soil traders Tang Futing and Chen Qifu transported a large quantity of opium to Zhenjiang in late August and early September of last year. Customs officers on the Taikoo Company's Wuchang ship seized two large boxes of opium and sent them to the county government for investigation. However, after several months of investigation, the criminals were not transferred to the court, and the opium was not announced and destroyed by burning. Wang Xun Chang and others suspect that former County Chief Kong shelved the case or that the county government did not have time to handle it. There are also rumors that former County Chief Kong Xiankeng resolved the case by accepting a bribe of 700 yuan, and the two boxes of opium were divided and sold. Although these are just rumors, they should not be dismissed. It is requested that the county magistrate, who is known for eradicating old evils and reforming malpractices, should strictly investigate this case of corruption and bribery. If the case has not yet been handled, it is requested that the case files be reviewed or that the customs be contacted to investigate and pursue the matter according to law to comfort the people and punish corruption. Upon investigation, the two names, Tang Futing and Chen Qifu, and the two boxes of opium were not approved for transfer, and there were no related files in the original case files. Separate letters were sent to the Zhenjiang Customs Service and the Zhenjiang Customs Superintendent's Office to inquire. The Zhenjiang Customs Service replied that in late October of last year, customs officials found 31 kilograms of opium on the Wuchang ship, arrested two people, and sent them to the county government along with a receipt. The Zhenjiang Customs Supervisor also replied that on the evening of October 30th of last year, at about 9 pm, the office received a phone call from the Zhenjiang Customs Service stating that customs officials had seized 31 kilograms of opium and the traffickers Tang Futing and Chen Qifu on the Wuchang ship and requested that they be handed over to the local officials for investigation. The office dispatched personnel to investigate and found that many gangsters were surrounding the customs. A phone call was made to former County Chief Kong to request assistance. The county dispatched personnel and police to the customs. The officials stated that since the people and opium were taken to the county, the Customs Commissioner agreed. Thus, the county escorted both the criminals and the opium from customs. The office immediately sent a letter to former County Chief Kong to investigate and handle the matter according to law and reported it to the Ministry of Finance and Salt Administration. Later, there was a rumor that the traffickers had been released. A letter was sent to inquire, but no reply was received. The files of the case are being sent for review. It should be investigated how former County Chief Kong handled this case and then reported back. County Chief Zhang asked former County Chief Kong to investigate and reply in detail and to send the original files that had not been filed to the county for review. Yesterday, Kong replied that it had been a long time since the transfer and that the cases were handled by the responsible staff. Therefore, it is difficult to recall each case handled during his term. The transfer matters were also handled by subordinate staff on his behalf, and the staff who originally handled the cases are now dispersed. Therefore, it is impossible to reply in detail for the time being. After receiving the letter, County Chief Zhang, believing that his words were evasive and difficult to justify a reply, intends to petition the Civil Affairs Department for review.</p>
<h3>Trial Proceedings of the Gao Ying Appeal Case</h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>After the lawyers' arguments, the questioning official again addressed Gao Ying and the other two defendants, asking if they had any arguments against the prosecutor's accusations. He then instructed Lawyer Wang and others to begin their arguments.</p>
<p>Wang Youling began by stating that he had four points to make especially clear at the start of his defense of Gao Ying regarding the opium charges. First, this case occurred in the United States, so the United States is paying close attention to this case. Other countries are also paying close attention. If asked what they are paying attention to, it can be confidently said that they are watching whether our country's trial is fair and appropriate. It is not fair and appropriate to find a guilty person innocent, nor can it be considered fair and appropriate to wrongly convict an innocent person. Therefore, Minister Wu presented a document to the National Government stating that this case must be handled according to the law, lest there be accusations of leniency, and if mistakes are made, there will be accusations of harshness. A proper trial would greatly benefit the abolition of consular jurisdiction, etc. Therefore, the judgment of this case will be eagerly awaited by all countries. This is the first point that should be noted. Second, Vice-Consul Gao Ying is a diplomat, and it is detrimental to the country's reputation for a diplomat to be suspected of involvement in an opium case. If Gao Ying is truly guilty and punished by the court according to the law, the country's reputation will be slightly damaged, but it will demonstrate the impartiality of our judiciary, which is still acceptable. However, if Gao Ying is not guilty but is punished indiscriminately due to foreign relations to show the strictness of our law enforcement, the country's reputation will be difficult to restore, and knowledgeable people from all countries will laugh at the immaturity of our judiciary. The country will suffer a great loss. This is the second point that should be noted. Third, after this case occurred, people across the country were greatly indignant because it concerned the country's reputation. The National Anti-Opium Society even sent a letter to the court strongly requesting a strict investigation. Whether their actions were legal is debatable, but their intention to rely on the power of the judiciary to restore the country's reputation is consistent. However, let us ask the members of the National Anti-Opium Society: Do you want to prosecute Gao Ying, who is truly guilty, or Gao Ying, who is greatly wronged? This lawyer dares to boldly answer on their behalf: They want to prosecute Gao Ying, who is truly guilty. Therefore, whether he is guilty or innocent depends solely on the fair judgment of the court. This is the third point that should be noted. Fourth, the system of collective punishment is a method from barbaric times. It has long been criticized that wives are punished for their husbands' crimes. If Gao Ying is guilty, Gao Ying should be punished. If Gao Liao is guilty, Gao Liao should be punished. If both Gao Ying and Gao Liao are guilty, then both should be punished. However, if Gao Liao is presumed guilty because Gao Ying committed a crime, or Gao is presumed guilty because Gao Liao committed a crime, then all husbands and wives in the world would be in danger. By extension, fathers, brothers, sons, and younger brothers would also be in danger. This is the fourth point that should be noted. The above four points have no direct bearing on clarifying the facts. However, the first trial determined Gao Ying's guilt based on these four points. This can be clearly seen in the original text of the judgment. Now, I would like to proceed to defend the facts. The only evidence in the case is the seal of the consulate on the seals. Even if there is a seal of the consulate, how can it be determined that Gao Ying delivered it to Gao Liao? Even if Gao Ying delivered it to Gao Liao, how can it be determined that it was for the purpose of transporting opium? A rope can strangle a person to death, and a kitchen knife can kill a person. However, giving someone a rope or a kitchen knife does not necessarily make one an accomplice. Even if we take a step back and say that the seal of the consulate is enough to determine Gao Ying's guilt, then it must be asked whether the so-called seal of the consulate</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>May 15, 1930 (Shen Bao, Second Sheet) Thursday (8</p>
<p>is genuine or not. The result of the investigation by the Customs revealed that one had no seal, one was not a consular seal, and one was not sealed by the consulate and was no different from ordinary printed matter. Even the so-called seal of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not pre-stored at the consulate, nor was it requested by Gao Ying and his wife. These facts are all evident in the official documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, Gao Ying, who has lived in San Francisco for a long time, has absolutely no connection with the printed matter (i.e., the so-called consular seal in the original document) on the suitcases sent from Hong Kong. The original trial paid attention to this seal. Even the prosecutor's appeal to the court focused on the seal to attack Gao Ying. If the various official documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are presented, I am afraid they will all be at a loss. As for Gao Ying knowing in advance that there were narcotics in the boxes before they were opened, it was because he asked the customs why they were detaining the luggage and received an answer from a customs official, similar to Minister Wu negotiating with the Ministry of Finance for an exemption from inspection and release, and hearing from the Ministry of Finance that there was a large quantity of opium in it according to the detective report. This happened after the detention, so how could it have helped in the transportation? If it is said that he refused to announce the names of the people in San Francisco, etc., it was because Gong Anqing said so in his telegram on July 10. Because Gong was at odds with Gao, he said this. However, the so-called refusal to announce the names is equivalent to not knowing who did it, which means it has nothing to do with him. Therefore, Gong's telegram on the 14th also stated that Gao and his wife still insisted on their previous statement that they had nothing to do with it, etc. The original trial's paraphrasing of evidence regarding Gao Ying's knowledge of the narcotics and his refusal to announce the names was superficial and did not focus on it. Now that the consular seal, which was presented as the only evidence, cannot be established at all, there is no need to refute these unimportant narratives in detail. This is the defense for Gao Ying's opium charges. As for the dereliction of duty charges, the original trial had two very concise statements: 1. Whether Gao Ying agreed to Chen Yi's request; 2. Whether it was within the scope of his duties. Now, there is no evidence that Gao Ying made any promises to Chen Yi. On the contrary, there is strong evidence that he refused, as evidenced by Chen Yi's letter to Gao Ying stating, "We received your telegram in the east. They have already boarded the ship and had to leave." If Gao Ying had not refused, how could this statement have been made? The original trial ignored this fact, and it is unknown why. Now, even if we put aside these facts and consider the consular duties regulations, the duties of a consul are specifically to appease overseas merchants and not to receive overseas laborers. Laborers and merchants are two completely different concepts. Although the official letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that matters that are necessary are also the responsibility of the consul, when Mei Guang and the other four arrived, Consul-General Gong sent Chief Clerk Sun Yuan to meet them. Therefore, it is clear that it was not a matter that the consul should have handled. Therefore, even according to the official letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it cannot be said that receiving overseas laborers was within the scope of the consul's duties. Based on the above defense, it should be requested that the original judgment be overturned for both the opium and dereliction of duty charges against Gao Ying, and that he be declared innocent. Next, this lawyer also has a prerequisite for the defense of Gao Liao: the judgment must have evidence, and if the evidence is insufficient, the basis for the judgment is weak. Therefore, before the judgment, the court should collect as much evidence as possible. During the last trial, the questioning official asked Gao Liao where she lived in Shanghai. She replied that she lived in her uncle's house. The official asked what her uncle's name was. She replied that she did not know. He also asked where she lived in Hong Kong. She replied that she lived in her brother-in-law's house. He also asked what her brother-in-law's name was. She also replied that she did not know. This situation may seem unreasonable at first glance, but upon closer examination, it makes perfect sense. Because she had not committed a crime before, she suddenly committed a major crime. When she arrived at the court, she was already mentally disturbed, and because she went to the United States with her husband, her husband was also implicated. This stimulation was very great, so it is not surprising that she said these things in court. Furthermore, the words she spoke to Chen Sheng in Shanghai cannot be used as evidence of conspiracy. Otherwise, if she lives in her uncle's house, does that mean her uncle is also a conspirator? When she arrived in Hong Kong and lived in her brother-in-law's house, does that mean her brother-in-law is also suspected of conspiracy? She is being judged alone, which is causing many people to be implicated in crimes. This makes her very uneasy, so these answers cannot be used as important evidence. As for Gao Liao bringing fourteen items from Hong Kong to the United States, opium was found in eleven of them, but these eleven items were entrusted to her by Chen Sheng. Although Chen Sheng cannot be found now, the two letters that were found are extremely beneficial to this case, as they prove that these eleven pieces of luggage containing opium were brought on behalf of others and were not her own. It is common for people to carry luggage for others, and there is no crime in that. As for the letters not being delivered by Chen Sheng in person, it is thought that Chen Sheng wanted to use Gao Liao to transport the opium, so he entrusted someone to send them. Gao Liao herself thought she was the consul's wife and was careless, and she did not bother to ask what was in the boxes. This is also normal. Gao Liao did not pay attention at the beginning, so it is difficult for her to know the details later. The original judgment that Gao Liao was guilty is not based on sufficient evidence. If it is said that they discussed transporting the opium beforehand, otherwise they would not have entrusted it so rashly, this speculation is also unrealistic. You must know that Gao Liao is the consul's wife, and her father was once the Cuban minister. Therefore, Chen Sheng and others saw that she had a very high status. Although they were not close friends, they entrusted her without a doubt. People trusted her psychology, which is also exploiting her psychology. Gao Liao is suffering this charge, and it is truly a wrongful charge. Furthermore, the criminal part of the original judgment is very absurd. The original judgment was based on Article 271 of the Criminal Law, which divides the crime into three categories: (1) manufacturing, (2) trafficking, (3) importing or exporting from a foreign country. Which category does this case fall under? Manufacturing and trafficking are not applicable. If it is said to be the third category, is transporting from Hong Kong to the United States importing from a foreign country or exporting to a foreign country? Therefore, the name of the crime in the original case is not accurate. Therefore, the original judgment has no value to be upheld and should be overturned, and she should be declared innocent.</p>
<p>Liu Shifang began by saying that his defense was the same as Lawyer Wang's. He will now divide it into three parts: (1) Gao Ying's opium trafficking part, (2) Gao Liao's opium trafficking part, and (3) Gao Ying's dereliction of duty part. He will now first discuss Gao Ying's opium trafficking part. (1) The defense refutes the fact that Gao Ying must have known that Gao Liao's luggage contained opium. (A) Although Gao Ying is Liao's husband, firstly, he cannot be determined to have known simply because of the husband-wife relationship. Secondly, there is no evidence to prove that they had any prior contact, because Gao Ying did not travel with his wife, and there were no letters or telegrams between them to prove it. (B) The issue of the seals is the point where it was determined in the first trial that Gao Ying gave Liao the seals in advance, but this is completely wrong. Firstly, according to the telegram that the defense received from the consulate, this seal did not have the consulate's seal. Secondly, looking at the photos sent from San Francisco, the thing stuck on the box does not look like a seal. As for saying that this seal was issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it has now been verified that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not issue the seal to the consulates abroad for pre-storage. Based on this, where did Gao Ying get this seal to give to Liao in advance? Furthermore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' original seals are not issued unless requested by the staff of the consulates abroad. Gao Ying did not return to the country beforehand, so how could he have obtained them? Upon investigation, when Gao Liao returned to the country in the 17th year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also proved that they did not request any seals. It can be seen that Gao Ying and Liao did not request the seals. Thirdly, the seal on the box is slightly square, and there is no consulate stamp on it. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' reply, it is no different from ordinary printed matter. Therefore, the part of this case concerning the seal cannot be used as evidence to establish guilt. (C) When Liao arrived at the San Francisco pier, Gao Ying went to meet her as a husband, which is normal. (D) Gao Ying reported to Minister Wu after the luggage was detained that there were a small number of narcotics in the box. Gao Ying knew this because he heard Harry Smith say it. It was not that he knew in advance. Harry Smith is the director of the narcotics department of the San Francisco Customs, so Gao Ying immediately believed it when he heard them say there was a narcotic message in the box. Therefore, he immediately telegraphed Minister Wu to report the situation. (E) As for saying that Gao Ying asked Minister Wu for help, there are several reasons for this. Firstly, the opium is related to the country's reputation. Secondly, helping each other as husband and wife is normal. Thirdly, Gao Ying's attitude when reporting was upright, and the telegram said "or send it to your office for inspection," which shows that he had no selfish intentions. Fourthly, he and Minister Wu both had patriotic aspirations. In the telegram that Minister Wu gave him on July 7, it said, "It is advisable for you to negotiate directly with the customs to avoid inspection and return it to China. Since it does not enter the country, it can be done. If it cannot be done, let me know by telegram." Based on this, is Minister Wu also suspected of shielding him? Consul-General Gong claimed that Gao Ying and his wife firmly refused to reveal the names of the opium traffickers, which is completely untrue. Firstly, Gong and Gao were at odds. Sun Yuan already confessed this in the first trial. Furthermore, the lawyer consultant of the San Francisco Consulate also wrote a letter stating that Gong and Gao Ying disagreed. Consul-General Gong said afterward that Nanjing had extremely strict laws for the punishment of opium smuggling, so Gao Ying and his wife would at least be sentenced to life imprisonment for this opium transportation. His slanderous attitude was overflowing with words. It can be seen how deeply he was resentful of Gao Ying. (Gong's comments are based on an interview with a foreign reporter published in the San Francisco Republic Daily on July 13 of last year.) All of the above facts can prove that Gao Ying had no opium trafficking behavior. Next, let's talk about Gao Liao's opium trafficking part. Gao Liao is only 24 years old this year, and her knowledge and experience are both immature. She grew up in a diplomatic family and often traveled extensively and had broad social contacts. She had never paid attention to human relations, so it is hardly credible that she has the courage to traffic opium. Because she is young and inexperienced and likes to engage in social interactions, she did not ask for Chen Sheng's address after meeting him at a banquet, and carrying gifts is a normal thing. When Chen Sheng asked her to bring the luggage, he said that someone would come to pick it up after arriving at the port, and Liao did not need to ask. Liao could not refuse to carry it, because Liao had not handled most of this luggage. Therefore, she did not know the number of pieces and the keys, etc. Until after the ship passed Honolulu, when filling out the declaration form, Liao did not know that there were prohibited items in the boxes, so of course she filled it out according to the regulations and did not distinguish between her own belongings and the eleven items that others entrusted her to carry. As for the seals on the boxes, Liao had not received them, so Chen Sheng must have forged them. From the above reasoning, the evidence of Liao transporting opium is not sufficient. Now there are four more points that can be used to refute this. Firstly, Liao knew that the luggage of consulate staff did not have absolute immunity from inspection, so she would never do this. Secondly, Liao never personally inspected the eleven pieces of luggage, so she certainly could not point them out when the customs officer asked her to. (See the San Francisco West News). Thirdly, there were no seals on Liao's own three items. Fourthly, all the letters that were found were sealed, so how could Liao know their contents (see the Western newspaper report in the case file). Looking at these four points, it further proves that Liao had no opium transporting behavior. However, Liao was deceived due to negligence. According to Article 25 of the Criminal Law, those who should be punished for negligence are limited to those who have special provisions. Since Liao was guilty due to negligence, there should be no punishment. As for the legal research in this case, it can be divided into two points: (1) The new anti-opium law cannot be invoked, because this case occurred before the promulgation of the new anti-opium law, so it is impossible to invoke it. Therefore, this case should still be based on the old anti-opium law or Article 271 of the Criminal Law, the law in force at the time of the act. However, since Gao Liao did not manufacture, traffic, or intend to traffic (Yu Xian and Shen Guang's letter to Shou Nan said that the goods were all Shen Guang's), then these two points are not valid. As for transportation, it is subject to restrictions according to Article 271 of the Criminal Law, "Importing or exporting from a foreign country must be related to this country to constitute a crime." Since Gao Liao went from Hong Kong to the United States, which is not Chinese territory, how can it constitute a crime? According to Article 1 of the Criminal Law, "If the law in force at the time of the act does not expressly prescribe a penalty, the act is not a crime," Gao Ying and Gao Liao are actually both innocent. Now, even if we take a step back and say that there are legal provisions that can be invoked, let us further study the issue of accomplices. (A) Principals: Those who instigate the commission of a crime beforehand, or who directly provide important assistance during the commission of the crime, are called principals. (B) Accomplices: Those who assist the principal are called accomplices. Now, let's talk about Gao Ying. He is not a principal. The principals are Wen Yuxian and Shen Guang, etc. The reasons are as follows: (1) Because there is no evidence that Gao Ying instigated Shen Guang, Yu Xian, etc. to sell opium beforehand. (2) Gao Ying did not provide direct and main assistance during the commission of the crime. This is because Gao Ying never left the United States and could not help Yu Xian, Shen Guang, etc. to handle the goods in Hong Kong. Next, let's talk about accomplices. Gao Ying is also not an accomplice, because he has no ordinary acts of assisting the principal. Assuming that Gao Ying's actions this time can be regarded as having the suspicion of assisting Gao Liao, then Gao Liao should be the principal. However, since the opium that Gao Liao carried was not his own, he cannot become a principal. Furthermore, Gao Ying had no evidence of instigating Liao beforehand, nor did he implement any acts of assistance, such as obtaining seals from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and giving square printed matter, etc. As for the issue of telegramming Minister Wu for help, this was completely an act after the fact and was due to the husband-wife relationship, which is normal. According to Article 177 of the Criminal Law, relatives who shield criminals or escapees who are legally arrested and detained and who have committed the crime in this article (i.e., the crime of concealing criminals and destroying evidence) are exempt from their sentences. Therefore, Gao Ying's request for help does not constitute the suspicion of committing a crime in this case. As for Gao Liao, as mentioned above, he is also not a principal. (1) Because he has no evidence of instigating Yu Xian and Shen Guang to sell opium. (2) There is no direct and important assistance during the commission of the crime. Please explain. Firstly, if Gao Liao is said to be the principal, it must be proved that he knew for sure that Shen Yuxian, etc. intended to sell opium. Secondly, his assistance and actual implementation of the act must prove that he had the act of selling opium. However, this opium was sold by Shen Guang, Yu Xian, etc. Gao Liao only provided ordinary assistance in transportation, so he cannot become the principal. At most, he is an accomplice. However, the true situation of Gao Liao's act of transporting opium can only be a crime of negligence. According to Article 27 of the Criminal Law, "Anyone who is not intentional, but according to the circumstances should pay attention and can pay attention but does not pay attention, is a crime of negligence. There is no guilt for crimes of negligence that are not specially stipulated," so Gao Liao is actually not guilty. This lawyer believes that the reasons for this defense are sufficient and requests that the original judgment be overturned and declared innocent. Let us now discuss Gao Ying's dereliction of duty part. In terms of substance, it can be investigated. If there is a promised bribe, there is certainly a fact to prove it. However, this case was constructed by Chen Yi's intention. Gao Ying already expressed his opposition in his reply telegram, so it cannot be said that he had a promise. As for the reward of three thousand, Chen got one-fourth and Gao got three-fourths, and later it was changed from two-four to two-six, which were all Chen Yi's decisions. Gao Ying did not participate (read Gao's telegram to Chen). Chen Yi is a diplomat. He is a consul in Mexicali, so he is very clear about the situation in the diplomatic field. He recruited Mei Guang and the other four to go to the United States. He handled the passports and agreed with Gao Ying to meet them in the United States and how to reward them, and said that the reward would be paid after the four arrived in the United States. However, later the four arrived at the port and were detained by the Immigration Bureau because their passports were not in compliance, and they were inspected. Only one of them carried twenty U.S. dollars, and the rest had no money. Based on this, isn't Chen Yi's bribery of Gao Ying fundamentally not established? Therefore, the original judgment that he was guilty of promising bribes and dereliction of duty is also not valid. This defense lawyer, based on the above reasons, asks the court to overturn the original judgment and declare him innocent. (Li Zongqian and Hu Zhen's arguments regarding Sun Yuan are all requested to maintain the original judgment, which is omitted.)</p>
<p>The debate was scheduled to be declared. After the debate, Gao Ying said that Gong Anqing had said that the San Francisco prosecutor said that Gao Ying had illegal behavior for two years. Please ask the court to inquire with the prosecutor there to clarify the truth. The questioning official nodded. Then, he ordered the clerk to read the confession and ordered the three defendants to affix their seals separately. Then, he announced that the debate in this case was concluded and scheduled to be declared at 2:00 p.m. on the 17th of this month. Gao Ying and the other two defendants were returned to prison. It was already 7:30 when they left the court.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhennian Arrives in Jinan from Yantai</h3>
<p>Will Go to Xuzhou to Meet Chiang Kai-shek and Report on Defense</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Liu Zhennian, commander of the 21st Division stationed in Yantai and member of the Shandong Provincial Government, originally planned to go from Yantai to Jinan to meet Chiang Kai-shek, the commander-in-chief, when he came to Jinan the day before yesterday for inspection to ask for instructions on everything. However, Chiang Kai-shek's visit was too brief, so he could not make it in time. He then decided to go to Xuzhou to meet him. At 7:00 a.m. on the 11th, he departed from Yantai by car. Because he was inspecting the troops along the way, he did not arrive in Weixian until 11:00 p.m. He then took a special train on the Jiaoji Railway to Jinan, arriving at the station at 7:00 a.m. today. Liu got off the car and went to the first-class lounge and exchanged greetings with the welcomers. He then took a car to the Zhongxi Hotel to stay. Those who came with him included Adjutant Zhang Yuliang, Councilor Liu Suru, etc. I visited him and asked the division commander whether the newly appointed commander of the 17th Army had taken office. Liu replied that he had only received the central government's telegram when he got on the car yesterday and had not officially taken office. I asked the division commander if he was going to Xuzhou. Liu replied that he would definitely go to Xuzhou with General Counselor Jiang Bocheng tonight to meet Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek and report on defense. It is heard that Liu's department has received a new order to temporarily station in Jiaodong, and the original defense will not be moved. (May 12)</p>
<h3>Han Stone Carvings Discovered in Teng County, Shandong</h3>
<p>Now Stored in the Provincial Library</p>
<p>In front of the Hongdao Academy in Teng County, Shandong, five Han stone carvings were excavated from ancient Han tombs when new houses were being built, as well as ancient swords, ancient coins, ancient mirrors, belt hooks, and many pottery items. The county's Education Bureau Director Li Wanzhang reported to the Education Department, and the Education Department sent Wang Xiantang, director of the Provincial Library, to the county to contact the Hongdao Academy to transport the stone carvings to the library. In addition to the five pieces, four more pieces were excavated at the academy, which were also generously donated by the Hongdao Academy for preservation in the library. It was also surveyed that the terrain was an ancient cluster of tombs. Searching northeast from there, two more stone carvings were excavated from the ancient tomb dug out beside the road. Two more pieces were found along the moat outside the North Gate of Tengcheng. Huang Futang, who lives in the North Gate of Tengcheng, also excavated two stones in the land near the Hongdao Academy this spring and donated them to the library. At the same time, Mr. Wang also heard that there were two stones stored in the old photo studio in the South Gate of Tengcheng. He went to inspect them and found that they were Han stone carvings. He negotiated and purchased them for sixty yuan. In total, eighteen stones were obtained before and after. Six of them are the largest in area and have not been found in previous discoveries of Han stone carvings. The patterns are all raised yangwen, which is also different from other stones. They were wrapped and transported to the Teng County Railway Station. Because of the military transportation, there was no car to transport them. Mr. Wang returned to Jinan and consulted with Committee Member He Xiancha, Committee Member Chen Xuenan, and Secretary-General Liu Jupo. Chairman Chen specially allocated vehicles from the Transportation Department of the Headquarters to transport them to Jinan Railway Station on the previous day. Yesterday (the 11th) morning, they were transported to the library for preservation. Mr. Wang is currently researching the patterns and carvings on the stone carvings, as well as the half-liang five-zhu coins and the patterns on the bronze mirrors and belt hooks, and the historical facts of the place of excavation. It has been determined that they are from the Eastern Han Dynasty. He is currently working on editing a book entitled "Newly Unearthed Han Stone Carvings and Other Items from Teng County," which will be published soon. It is also planned to build a building in the courtyard, with the inner walls of the lower floor inlaid with stone carvings, to be named Han Painting Hall. The ancient coins from all dynasties will be displayed on the upper floor, to be named Luoquan Tower. These ancient coins were formerly owned by Ma Guohan of Licheng. Several coins are combined and inlaid into one plate. Ma conducted research on each of them and engraved them on the plate. There are a total of 610 plates, ranging from the Shang and Zhou dynasties to the late Ming Dynasty. The collection is extremely complete and is the most important reference material for the study of the monetary system of all dynasties.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Planning to Expand the Henan Area</h3>
<p>Provincial Government and Party-Government Organs All Plan to Move to Henan</p>
<p>Recently Determined Routes, Residential, and Industrial-Commercial Zones</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Although the war situation in Guangdong Province has been frequent recently, the authorities are still paying attention to local new construction within a possible scope. The model area of Guangzhou and the Shipai Forest Farm have already started construction separately. At the same time, the Zhujiang Railway Bridge connecting the two sides of Hebei and Henan is also under construction. Recently, there is also a plan to develop the inner port of Henan and expand the Henan urban area. The inner port project has already invited contractors to build it a few days ago. The Henan expansion plan has also been thoroughly planned by the authorities based on the principles of urban design. In the future, all large and small organs of Guangdong Province will also be moved to Henan. The provincial government compound, provincial and municipal party headquarters, museums, art galleries, libraries, and other large and small government organs all plan to be built in Sansonggang and Deshenggang in Henan. The administrative district here is connected to a 100-foot-wide open road in the north, directly connected to the Zhujiang Railway Bridge, and reaches the Huangpu commercial port in the south. Considering that Henan is surrounded by water on all sides, like a small island, the north bank faces the long shoreline of Guangzhou City from a distance. The current Zhujiang Railway Bridge only crosses the river from the Weixin Road intersection in Guangzhou. In the future, when necessary, it is planned to build two more bridges on the south bank, forming three bridges in total, to facilitate transportation between the north and south banks. As for the Henan roads, the main trunk roads take the Zhujiang Bridge intersection and Huangpu as the starting and ending points. The inland branch lines adopt a chessboard pattern, adjacent to the new provincial government area, and the road adopts a spider web pattern. In order to ensure that the houses in each section are exposed to the sun every season, the route does not take a north-south orientation, but will be biased to the northwest by about 30 degrees to seek uniform light. The scenery around Qixinggang is beautiful, the water is calm, and the trees are lush. It is planned to open an outdoor park near the Gang and use the river connecting Zhoutouzui to Yadunguan to imitate the legacy of the Qinhuai River, with tree-lined avenues on both sides. The Nantoutou Shuzhugang and other places along the stream are also rich in scenery, and it is also planned to be developed into a garden and forest along the river. The entire island area is divided according to its terrain. The areas from Zhoutouzui to Nantoutou Liheng, etc. are convenient for transportation and close to the railway stations of the Inner Port, Guangdong-Han, and Guangzhou-Sanshui railways, so they are designated as industrial areas. The riverside houses close to the industrial area are designated as commercial areas. From the Shimingshi Factory Fangcun area to Yadunguan, it is suitable for loading and unloading goods near the Zhujiang River, so it is designated as a commercial area for wholesale warehouses and light industry. The sides of the main road trunk lines are also included in the commercial area, and the remaining sections are designated as residential areas, allowing people to purchase land and build houses.

<h3>Chuansha</h3>
<p>Result of County Government Officials' Fraud Case: Mai Caisheng, a farmer from Sizao Port outside the west gate of Chuansha County, was defrauded of 100 silver dollars by county government officials Wu Zanxun and others on the 26th of last month on the grounds of selling and smoking opium. Afterwards, after Mai entrusted someone to send a letter to the county government, Ruan County Magistrate Fu ordered an investigation and detained Cai Wenlong, the main culprit in this case, to await judgment. The other four people were indeed found to have been swindling and defrauding, and they were immediately dismissed from their posts. A notice was posted on the 13th to warn against illegal activities.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>A Newlywed Bride Hidden Before the Wedding: Zhang Axiang, a farmer from Yangziqiao, Qingpu County, is 21 years old this year. In the 14th year of the Republic of China, he hired Yuan Fusheng's daughter, Simei, from the same village as his wife through matchmakers Yao Hongsun and Pan Jiugao. The wedding date was chosen and the wedding was held the day before yesterday. On that day, the groom's house was decorated with red and ribbons, and it was very lively. Relatives and friends gathered and a large banquet was held. A sedan chair was hired to go to the bride's house to pick her up. Unexpectedly, the bride's house showed no signs of action. The sedan chair carriers had to carry the sedan chair back. Relatives and friends were indignant when they saw this. The groom inquired about the situation and ordered the original matchmakers to negotiate seriously with the bride's family. Yuan replied that his daughter was not at home and did not know where she had gone. The original matchmaker reported the situation to the groom, who immediately reported it to Zhu Inspector of the Xujing Town Public Security Sub-Bureau. After receiving the report, Zhu Inspector ordered police officer Fu Yuan Fusheng to come to the station for questioning. According to his statement, his daughter was indeed not at home and was hidden by his relative Zhu Fuliang. The next day, Yuan was escorted to the city and interrogated by the County Public Security Bureau. After confirming the facts, he was transferred to the county government for investigation. It is now known that the county government has issued a warrant to arrest Zhu Fuliang for questioning. An elderly couple had a quarrel, and the daughter-in-law committed suicide by poisoning. The family was well-off and had no children. They adopted a nephew as their son and a adopted daughter named Lüzhu. The son and daughter held a formal wedding the day before yesterday (the 7th). Everything was arranged extraordinarily. Unexpectedly, three days after the wedding, for some unknown reason, Luo had a quarrel with Lüzhu, and they argued with each other. Lüzhu was unusually depressed and unwilling to live, so she sneaked into the room and secretly swallowed poison and committed suicide. By the time her family discovered that she had been poisoned too deeply, there was no way to save her.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Announcement of New Appointments of Public Security Bureau Staff: After Zhu Yuanbo, the new head of the county Public Security Bureau, took office in Songjiang, he did not make any changes to the internal staff, as he was familiar with the work. However, the positions of Director of the Judicial Section and Chief Inspector had already been vacated as Tao, the former bureau head, had gone elsewhere. Therefore, new appointments were made to fill the vacancies. Xie Shixin was appointed as the Chief of the First Section, Huang Xinyi as the Chief of the Second Section, Yu Shifang as the Chief of the Third Section, and Zhang Jiagan as the Chief Inspector. There were no temporary changes to the various branch bureaus in the outer districts. However, Chen Rongzhou, the patrol officer of the Wuku area, was eager to follow Tao elsewhere and had already resigned. Before leaving, Tao appointed Shen Shouquan to fill the vacancy.</p>
<p>Verdict in Pheasant Creek Chen Family Kidnapping Case: On the evening of June 8th last year, 30 to 40 bandits from the Yan family of Pheasant Creek, Wuku, kidnapped Wu, Jinghua, Xinhua, and Gui Fang, family members of the Chen family and the Shen Jiu Gao family. After the county government sent a telegram to the water police to arrest them, the guards of the hostages found out and all escaped. The arrested people were rescued and returned home. Later, the water police arrested Wang Dengcai, Wang Qiming, Zhang Yunchao, Liu Dekun, Shen Bigui, and Zhang Yunshan. After interrogation by the county government, it was confirmed that, in addition to the escaped bandits who would be pursued further, Shen Bigui, Zhang Xuechao, and Liu Dekun were sentenced to two life imprisonments each. Wang Dengcai, Wang Qiming, and Zhang Yunshan were each sentenced to two terms of 12 years imprisonment. The sentences of 15 years imprisonment were enforced as a warning.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>Kidnapping Case Occurs in Pengjiatan: On the afternoon of the 8th, a group of bandits suddenly came to the Pengjiatan area southeast of Matang and robbed the houses of Chen Yuxuan, Chen Guolin, and others. Before leaving, they kidnapped Chen Guolin to the bandit den. Chen then paid 400 silver dollars to redeem him.</p>
<p>A Large Number of Bandits Were Found: On the afternoon of the 8th, two bandit scouts suddenly came to the Qian family in Qianjia Changzhuang, Motou District, Rugao County. They were captured by the local security group and sent to the county for interrogation. The two bandits confessed that they had many accomplices. A team was immediately dispatched and the bandit scouts were taken along to Gujia Zhuang, Motou District, where 16 bandits were arrested, including a woman who was the wife of the bandit leader. According to her, her husband was leading a large group of bandits with a large number of weapons and ammunition to Taixing to rob.</p>

<h3>Local Correspondence Two Suzhou</h3>
<p>Appeal Judgment on Horse-Riding Accident Case: Zheng Hongzhang, a student from Shanghai Minli Middle School, came to Suzhou for sightseeing on March 8th. While riding a horse outside Panmen, he caused an accident that injured and killed Zhou Huchen, an old man. After the Wu County District Court concluded its trial on March 24th, it ordered Zheng to pay 750 yuan as compensation to Zhou's family and 50 yuan for medical expenses, and sentenced him to 50 days of detention with a two-year suspended sentence. Subsequently, the prosecutor appealed, and the High Court reviewed the case and revoked the original sentence of 50 days of detention. Zheng Hongzhang was sentenced to one year of imprisonment with a three-year suspended sentence for the crime of causing death due to negligence. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be reduced by one day for every two days.</p>
<p>Shuyang Counter-Revolution Case Declared Not Guilty: The case of Hu Hanxia, head of the Shuyang Public Security Bureau, and Rong Jiashu, Jiang Hanqing, Zhang Zhaoguang, Sun Yuchang, Li Yaofeng, and others from the Autonomous Region, who were suspected of counter-revolutionary activities, has been repeatedly heard by the High Court. Hu and others claimed that they were framed by Dong Shenghan, the county magistrate of the county, and that the reactionary letters were also forged by Dong. The plaintiff, Long Maoxiang, testified that Dong County Magistrate made the report and ordered me to affix the stamp and said that I knew nothing about the contents. The witness Liu Baocun testified that there was no factual evidence to prove that they held secret meetings, and that what was said in the investigation report was what County Magistrate Dong ordered me to report. The reactionary letters in the case were also identified by the appraiser as not written by Rong Jiashu. Therefore, the case was announced by the presiding judge Zheng Chi in court on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 13th) that all six people including Hu were not guilty and were allowed to be released on bail. It is now known that Hu and others were released from prison yesterday morning (the 14th).</p>
<p>Sixty-Eight Pound Tumor: Ding, the wife of Jiang Mucheng, a resident of Dongshuiguan River in Baoying, is 27 years old this year. Her abdomen began to swell a few years ago. At first, she suspected she was pregnant, but later it grew larger and larger, almost like a snail. She came to Suzhou to seek treatment at the Boxi Hospital in Tianshizhuang a few days ago. After examination by Dr. Sumair, the director of surgery, it was determined that she had a tumor. After it was removed, it weighed 68 pounds. It is also a strange story. Now, the wound has healed and she is in good spirits and will be discharged from the hospital soon.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Problem of Interrogating Escapees After Arrest: Seven escapees, including Li Chengguo, escaped from the Wuxi Detention Branch on the morning of March 26. Two of the escapees, Yuan Asan and Wu Xirong, were arrested by the county in Shanghai on the 9th of this month. After interrogation, they were chained and imprisoned. The county government has transferred the case files and the clerk of the detention branch, Hua Yinqiu, and the guard, Jiang Hailin, to the Wu County District Court for interrogation. It is necessary to thoroughly investigate whether there was bribery and connivance in the fact that the prisoners in the new cell had a group dinner the day before the incident and delayed the time to pursue the fugitives afterwards. In addition to reporting to the provincial government for instructions, the county government also consulted the Wu District Court yesterday on whether it was necessary to transfer the case to Suzhou for interrogation.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Sun Will Not Be Transferred For the Time Being: Recently, it has been rumored in our county that Peng Guoyan, the former county magistrate of Wu County, will come to Wuxi to succeed the county magistrate. It has been rumored that the current county magistrate of our county, Sun Zuji, will be transferred to the provincial government. Until yesterday, it was also rumored that County Magistrate Sun would be transferred with Huang Yunchen, the county magistrate of Wu County. The rumors vary from person to person. According to a guest returning from the provincial capital, the provincial government will not change County Magistrate Sun for the time being, and the other rumors are all speculation. Seeing this, the problem of the transfer of the county magistrate will be realized in a short period of time.</p>
<p>A Woman's Corpse with Injuries Found in Huishan Town: A woman's corpse was found on the beach at the entrance of Lao Huangniqiao Bang near Huishan Town outside the west gate of our county at 6:00 a.m. yesterday (the 14th). There were several purplish-blue marks on her feet. Jiang Zixian, the local security guard, reported to the county government and requested an autopsy. However, according to the speculation of the general public, the cause of death was probably due to adultery.</p>
<p>Tragic News of an Unlicensed Midwife Removing a Stillborn Fetus: Sun, the wife of Zhang Huisheng (from Yancheng), a resident near Cangbang in the west gate of our county, was pregnant last year and is now due to give birth. At 8:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, she felt pain in her abdomen. Huisheng went to invite Yan Zhang, an unlicensed midwife, to come to her home to deliver the baby. Unexpectedly, she was not familiar with surgery and actually removed a hole on the top of the fetus's head, causing fresh blood to flow out. The fetus died instantly. Huisheng's mother, Zhang Liu, took the midwife Yan Zhang to the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau to investigate. Zhou, the director of the branch, held a preliminary hearing and found that Yan Zhang was operating illegally without a license, causing death. It was extremely illegal and ordered her to be temporarily detained and transferred to the county government for strict handling according to law.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Department of Agriculture Manages New Rural Affairs: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture previously received a request from Lu Dun and other representatives of the ten households in Suining to build a new rural village. The Department of Construction was consulted and dispatched personnel to investigate and reply. It was agreed that the construction of new villages should be planned within the existing disaster relief funds of the province. The Department of Finance has now allocated the required funds in full, and the Department of Construction has also appointed the director of the County Construction Bureau as the instructor. The Department of Agriculture has appointed Ren Chunxiu to be responsible for hosting everything. The groundbreaking ceremony was held the day before yesterday and construction began. It is reported that the Department of Agriculture plans to build a total of five new villages to improve the rural areas of the entire province. One is in Yanken, one in Chunhua Town, one in Changgou Village, one in Huangxu, and one in Shijiadun. The subsidy fees for the five places were included in the 18th-year budget. Later, due to the provincial treasury's shortage of funds, the Yanken District, Chunhua Town, and Changgou Village were not started. Only Huangxu, which is close to the provincial capital, was organized in October last year as a demonstration. The Zhenjiang County Huangxu Rural Improvement Experimental Zone Committee was established, and the provincial government approved the transfer of subsidy fees to carry out the project. The Shijiadun New Rural Village was delayed until today due to the provincial government's suspension of subsidy fees.</p>
<p>The Fourth District of the Water Police Suppresses Bandits: Yesterday, the Jiangsu Provincial Security Office received a telegram from the Suining County Government reporting that the sea bandit Shen Guanxi led bandit ships and repeatedly attempted to enter the port. It requested that Zhu, the director of the Fourth District of the Water Public Security Bureau, be ordered to dispatch a team to suppress them. After receiving the telegram, the Security Office ordered Zhu, the director of Wusong, to dispatch a team to work closely with the county magistrate to suppress them.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Guanyin Tower Robbed: The monk in charge of the Guanyin Tower in the south gate of the city learned that a club loan had been obtained. Yesterday night, a group of bandits came to rob. Unexpectedly, the monk had deposited the loan in another place. The bandits searched everywhere. It was heard that the monk's sister, who had returned to Yangzhou from Shanghai, lived in the tower. More than 100 silver dollars and jewelry were robbed by the bandits, who then fled. There were no other losses.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Interrogation of Communist Leaders: The Public Security Bureau cracked down on a Communist organization in the east of the city and captured the leader Xu Zhongdou and many important pieces of evidence on the spot. After a strict interrogation by the county government on the 13th, a confirmed confession was obtained and telegraphed to the province for verification. The Jiangsu Provincial Education Association Concluded: The Jiangsu Provincial People's Education Museum Association held its third annual meeting in Nantong. Over the past few days, 86 important cases have been resolved and the location for the next meeting has been voted on. Songjiang was elected. The closing ceremony was then held.</p>
<p>Banditry Worsens in the Four Rural Areas: In Nantong's four rural areas, bandits and Communists have become increasingly rampant recently. Representatives from various towns near the city have come to the city to report an emergency. Li Changjiang, the commander of the bandit suppression in the nine counties north of the Yangtze River, arrived in Nantong on the 13th to supervise the team to suppress the bandits in the east. The troops in Pingchao in the west were strengthened, and the city was placed under special alert. Many people have moved in from the rural areas to avoid the chaos inside and outside the city, and housing prices have soared. A telegram was sent requesting that the property of Yan Xiong Nan, a local of Nantong, be confiscated. When Yan Xiong Nan was the head of the county police team, he was greedy and unlawful and lost a large amount of weapons and ammunition in the bandit area. The province ordered him to be dismissed and he has not been arrested. Zhang Kui and others, the chiefs of the district, telegraphed the provincial government, saying that Yan Dian Nan's tenure of office was only to collect money from the people, reaching 100,000 yuan, and the county police team's expansion funds were not available. Yan Dian Nan's property should be confiscated in full to purchase firearms. Returning the fat of Nantong people to the people of Nantong is reasonable and reasonable.</p>
<h3>Shan</h3>
<p>Gathering Communists and Bandits Captured in Fengjing: Communists and bandits in the four rural areas of Fengjing are rampant, causing suffering. Yesterday, there was another gathering to plot unrest. The Fengjing Joint Defense Office learned of this and dispatched a team to the countryside overnight. Ye and Zhu and other five people were captured in Qingshui Temple. They are currently being interrogated.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Robbery and Injury Case Occurs in Meihu District: The Meihu District in northern Jiaxing adjoins the Wen Port of Jiangsu, and bandits can easily come and go. The villages of Lüjia and Shijia in the area were suddenly attacked by more than 20 bandits with guns and weapons. They robbed the houses of Shi Zhongliang, Shi Xugao, Shi Xuxing, Ling Shunfu, Fu, and Wu Yougao in succession. They stabbed Wu Yougao's left eye with a sharp knife and shaved off the flesh on his forehead. Shi Hexiao, a worker of Shi Xugao, was also hit in the ribs by bandits with weapons and may be in danger of life. Shi Xuxing and his wife were unable to escape and were caught by the bandits, tied up with ropes, and thrown to the ground, also suffering serious injuries. After the fourth watch, the bandits howled and left. A total of 45 dan of white rice, 194 silver dollars, more than 30 leather coats, and other gold, silver, and miscellaneous items were robbed, which was quite a loss. The next day, the injured Wu Yougao, Shi Hexiao, and others were taken to Suzhou for medical treatment. On the same day, Wang Changsheng's boat in Liujiadang, near the area, was also stopped by bandits and robbed of silver dollars and clothes. Zhang Linshou's boat was also almost robbed.</p>
<p>Slaughter Surcharge Ordered by the County to Be Re-audited: The Jiaxing County Administrative Meeting previously decided to increase the slaughter surcharge by 40% to cover education and public welfare expenses. Subsequently, the Fresh Meat Industry Association presented a request to the province to order the county to exempt the increase in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. It is now known that the county government recently received instructions from the province to re-examine the industry's situation and submit a proposal for re-audit.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Mayor Discusses Construction Issues: Ningbo Mayor Yang Ziyi believes that various construction projects in the city must be actively carried out. A few days ago, he hired Yuan Ludeng, Yu Qiaqing, Sun Meitang, and other celebrities from Shanghai as construction committee members. Yesterday, because the committee members came to Ningbo to attend the Yu family funeral, he hosted a banquet at Hengyuan on the north bank of the Jiang River to discuss raising public bonds for tap water and paying off old debts. However, the committee members had to return to Shanghai on the same day, so there was no concrete resolution. A New Livestock Store Was Robbed: Wen Ruyi, the owner of the Xinshengshun Silk and Cloth Store in Qianxu, east of Yin County, has been running the store for many years and the business is quite good. Unexpectedly, eight bandits suddenly came to rob the store at about 8:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. After investigation, the loss was more than 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Director of Foreign Cloth Donation Bureau Appointed: After all cloth donations in the province were collected by the government and a special bureau for unified cloth donations was established in the provincial capital, it is now known that Hu Futong, the director-general, appointed Shi Liangchen, a Ningbo merchant, as the director of the Ningbo branch bureau yesterday. He took office yesterday and began to work, and plans to establish branches in Zhenhai, Dinghai, Chuanshan, Shenjiamen, Shipu, and other places in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Starting Fair-Priced Grain Sales: The Shaoxing Grain Maintenance Association previously purchased 13,000 bags of futures rice in Shanghai to provide relief because of the local rice shortage. Now that Shanghai rice merchants have delivered the goods ahead of schedule, the association is raising funds to transport the futures rice to Shaoxing and will start fair-priced grain sales.</p>
<p>Soliciting Public Bonds for Disaster Relief: The disaster in Tianle Township, Shaoxing, is extremely severe. The county executive committee has sent a letter to the Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association to request assistance. The Zhejiang Disaster Relief Public Bond Subscription Tickets have now been issued for 10,000 yuan, with 5,000 yuan for disaster relief in Tianle Township and 5,000 yuan for immigration. County Magistrate Tang sent letters to each solicitation committee member to solicit subscriptions separately.</p>
<h3>Fuliang</h3>
<p>Tea Shops Transporting Silver Dollars Robbed on the Road: The amount of silver dollars needed by Qi Fu Tea Shops every year is huge. In addition to Qiupu Qimen selling tickets and transporting silver dollars to Tunxi and Anqing, most of them are handled in Jingzhen. Now that the new tea is on the market, tea shops are transporting silver dollars from Jingzhen into the mountains one after another. However, Qi Fu is deep in the mountains, transportation is inconvenient, and waterways are difficult. The transportation of silver dollars into the mountains relies entirely on small boats. On the 5th of this month, the tea shops of Wushang Shunchangyong and others in the Bai Mao Port area of Fuliang, with a silver dollar shipment of 10,000 yuan, were robbed by dozens of bandits with red and blue cloth wrapped around their heads and holding guns on a boat 100 miles away from Liukou. The tea shop suffered this loss and had no money to run the tea business and had to close down. Other shops have learned from this and are wary and dare not go to the town to purchase.</p>
<p>Letter Received</p>
<h3>Letter from the Beijing Liaison Office of the Twelfth Division</h3>
<p>To the Editor: We recently read the Hong Kong telegram in the Domestic News section of your newspaper on the 9th, which stated that the Zhang Zhen and Liu Heding Divisions attacked Lu Xingbang's rebel forces, including the Mao Huai Shou Brigade and the Zhang Zhiying Regiment, and that the Wei and Zhou Brigades were reportedly surrounded by the Wei and Zhou forces in Songkou Dabu, which could be resolved. Upon investigation, when our division was ordered to be transferred from Fujian to Jiangxi in March, the thirty-fourth brigade commander Wei Chu, who was dismissed from our division last winter, colluded with reactionary factions and secretly mobilized Zhou Niliqun, the brigade commander of the thirty-sixth brigade, to lead his seventy-first regiment Ding Jianfan's forces to rebel in Ruijin, Jiangxi. The rebel soldiers of our division are only a regiment. The Hong Kong telegram mentioned the Wei and Zhou Brigades, which we believe is a misrepresentation. We are deeply concerned that this will have a small impact on our division and a large impact on the public security in the rear. Please publish this letter in your newspaper to correct this error. The Beijing Liaison Office of the 12th Division of the National Revolutionary Army, May 10th, 19th Year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>General Representative Zhang Boling's Remarks</h3>
<p>The Future of the Sports World is Very Optimistic</p>
<p>Attention Must Be Paid to the Personality of Athletes</p>
<p>This Year's Chinese Team Has Made Progress Compared to Before</p>
<p>More Hopeful in Several Competitions</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Boling, the General Representative of the Chinese Team and President of the National Sports Advancement Association, took the Japanese ship "Taiyo Maru" eastward this morning. This reporter noted that Mr. Zhang had also represented the Chinese team to Japan once during the Third Far Eastern Games. This time, revisiting the old place, he was even more in charge. Some people visited him at the Huizhong Hostel last night and had a conversation. Mr. Zhang was very optimistic about the future of our country's sports. He was full of smiles during the conversation, which showed his inner joy. This reporter (asked): Do you have any thoughts on whether this year's Far Eastern Chinese team has made progress? (Answered) My impression of this year's Chinese team is different from the past. There are two points. First, in the past eight Far Eastern Games, the planning of all matters of the Chinese team relied heavily on foreign countries. However, this time, it was entirely done by Chinese people. This point is worth mentioning. Second, the spirit of the athletes of this year's Chinese team is more full than before. (Asked) Do you also have any predictions regarding the strength of the Chinese team? (Answered) I dare not make a rash judgment on the strength, because there has been no competition with others. However, in my opinion, in sports, the personality and spirit of athletes are very important. Winning or losing is secondary. China is inferior to others in everything. It is too early to want to win in sports. However, this time, our sports have indeed improved compared to the eighth session. Track and field, swimming, etc., because the difference is still far away, can not be discussed. There are some hopes for ball games such as volleyball and basketball. (Asked) Have you also heard about the change of the competition rules? (Answered) Any amendment to the regulations must be agreed upon by the three countries. I have not heard of it yet. Fortunately, if you want to change it, it must be after the ninth session.</p>

<p>Athletes from all over the country gathered in Shanghai and set off eastward today to participate in the Far Eastern Games. The Shanghai YMCA produced 150 beautiful (9th Far Eastern Games Commemorative Booklets) to distribute to the athletes. A welcome party was held in the hall of the association yesterday to encourage them. Because the athletes were busy packing, it was called off.</p>
<p>The YWCA Sends Off Female Athletes</p>
<p>At 7:00 p.m. on the 13th, the Shanghai YWCA hosted a banquet at its location on Dith Avenue to send off the Chinese female athletes to the Far Eastern Games. In addition to all the female athletes, Ms. Wang Shufang, Ms. Lu Huiqing, Ms. Ding Shujing, Ms. Kuai Shuping, and Mrs. Mei Huaquan, Mrs. Zheng Wei, Mrs. Fu Ruoyu, and Mrs. Li Juyang, who are directors of the association, attended. After the banquet, Ms. Ding Shujing, the chairperson, reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, Ms. Kuai Shuping gave a speech, saying that sports can not only strengthen the body and improve morality, but also understand the meaning of true freedom, and hope to win glory for the country after going to Japan. Then, there was Mrs. Zheng Wei's Madeline, Ms. Chen Peiyue's piano, and Ms. Li Guan's Japanese opera, which were melodious and pleasant. The athletes' performances also contributed their strengths. Finally, the chairperson gave a farewell speech and the meeting ended.</p>
<p>The reporter asked Mr. Zhang whether he had any suggestions for the Sino-Japanese-Philippine student games and the Pacific countries games with an expanded scope. Mr. Zhang replied that he had heard about this matter, but had not yet met with the Philippine and Japanese authorities and could not make any comments. The expansion of the Far Eastern Games is also important, but it is still too far away at present.</p>

<p>Mr. also said to the reporter: The original intention of the Far Eastern Games was to select Zhang Cai to participate in the World Games. Unfortunately, it has not been realized in the past eight sessions. Our country is no exception. Only individuals from the Philippines and Japan participated. Finally, the reporter asked how Mr. Zhang felt about the national sports world in the three years since the eighth Far Eastern Games. Mr. Zhang said that the national sports world has made significant progress in these three years. When the eighth games closed, I encouraged the athletes in the country with three things: (1) I hope that the national press will promote sports news; (2) Pay more attention to amateur sports; (3) Practice hard and get more competition opportunities. These three points have been quite effective in the past three years, and the newspaper promotion of the first item has been the most effective. It cannot be said that it is not a good phenomenon in the sports world. As for the personality and spirit of athletes, it is the life of all sports. I will call the athletes on the ship to pay attention to this point. In short, I am very optimistic that our country's sports undertakings will become more and more developed in the future. Mr. Zhang smiled and stopped. The reporter wished him success on this trip and said goodbye.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang Comforts Shanghai Athletes</p>
<p>The Chinese athletes attending the Far Eastern Games are scheduled to depart today. There are 20 Shanghai athletes selected to attend the meeting. Mayor Zhang specially instructed Director Chen of the Education Bureau to represent the mayor personally to express condolences and encouragement to the representatives, and to send one thousand gold to the athletes for their recuperation needs in order to strengthen their morale. The Education Bureau sent letters to each athlete to go to the bureau to receive the money. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., Director Lu personally presented the money to the athletes. The athletes expressed their gratitude and took a group photo and dispersed.</p>
<p>Domestic Goods Factories Encourage Morale</p>
<p>The Chinese team to attend the Far Eastern Games is scheduled to depart this morning. Ten famous Shanghai domestic goods factories, including Sanyou Industrial Society, Home Industry Society, Wuzhou Gubeng Soap Factory, Shengde Weaving Factory, China Enamel Factory, China Chemical Industry Society, Tianchu MSG Factory, Guanshengyuan Yixin Toothbrush Factory, and Renchangyong Material Factory, are paying tribute to the hard work of the male and female athletes who represent China at the conference and add glory to the country. Each factory presents its own products, such as Sanyou's towels, the Home Industry Society's cologne, Shengde's toothpicks and handkerchiefs, China Enamel's standing crane basins, Chemical Industry Society's toothpaste, Wuzhou's soap and Liangdan, Tianchu's MSG, Yixin's toothbrushes, Guanshengyuan's candies, and Renchangyong's glass towers, to 140 athletes to strengthen their morale. After being collected by the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, they are packed into a brocade box with everything for food, drink, and bathing. It is beautiful and rich, and 20 copies of the Federation of Trade Unions magazine are also given to each person. Yesterday, a special commissioner was sent to deliver the gifts to each representative to wish the athletes success in Japan. This is also a good story in the midst of advocating domestic goods. In addition, the China Underwear Company also made exquisite clothing and distributed it to the athletes, with a huge value.</p>

<h3>Chinese Football Team Wins West Concession Team Four to Two</h3>
<p>Three to Zero in the First Half, One to Two in the Second Half</p>
<p>The Whole Team Gathers for the First Time, and the Connection is Not Mature</p>
<p>The Chinese football team played against the Shanghai West Concession team at the China Football Field yesterday for practice. As a result, the Chinese team won by four to two. Shanghai fans went to watch the game yesterday because they admired the skills of the national army. The football field was just full, but they had already left one after another before the end of the game.</p>

<p>Full Scene Review</p>
<p>The situation in the first half was still wonderful. Defender Li Tiansheng and right winger Cao Guicheng had excellent performances, which were praised by the audience. The rest of the players were also outstanding, but they failed to live up to expectations due to a lack of connection. In the second half, Cao Guicheng, Sun Sijing, and Chen Zhenhe did not play, and Liang Yanzan replaced Sun, Feng Yunyou replaced Chen, Chen Guangyao was transferred to the right wing, and Ye Beihua was on the left wing. The situation became more dull and less exciting.</p>
<p>Work Hard</p>
<p>Although the results of yesterday's performance are gratifying, we still need to train hard. This Far Eastern Championship must be said to be stable. All athletes will go east this morning. It is expected that there will be many days before the opening of the conference in Japan. We must work hard and train hard to maintain the reputation of our country's victorious army. I hope you all will work hard.</p>
<p>Strike First</p>
<p>The battle yesterday was originally scheduled to start at 4:00 p.m. Because the West Concession team arrived a little late, the battle began at 4:30 p.m. The national army struck first. Sun Jinshun and Chen Guangyao jointly attacked. Chen Guangyao passed the ball to the West Concession goal. Chen Jiaqiu shot very quickly. The West Concession was in a hurry and did not know what to do. Unexpectedly, the ball hit the West Concession player's thigh and bounced out of bounds. Cao Guicheng kicked the corner kick and the landing point was very good, but it failed to work.</p>
<p>Sun Breaks Record</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, the West Concession suddenly became fierce and pressed hard in front of the national army's goal. Fortunately, the inner defense was well-placed and the crisis was resolved. Li Ning sent the ball to the front. Chen Jiaqiu cut the ball to the right side. Cao Guicheng dribbled and chased to the appropriate spot and passed it to the West Concession goal. Sun Jinshun took the opportunity to shoot the ball directly into the goal. The national army won a goal.</p>
<p>Two Wings Score</p>
<p>Although the victory was divided, the situation was still not tense. Dai Linjing got the ball from Chen Guangyao and returned it to Sun Jinshun. Sun got the ball and passed the defense line and approached the West Concession goal. He had entered no man's land. The audience thought it was easy to succeed, but he was too hasty and the foot was slightly skewed and failed to hit the target. When it was 25 minutes, Dai Linjing passed the ball to Cao Guicheng. Cao dribbled quickly and went in and passed the ball high to the West Concession goal. Unexpectedly, the ball fell into the left corner of the West Concession goal, and they won another goal. This was a pleasant surprise. After that, the West Concession team got a very good opportunity in front of the national army's goal, but the shot missed by a hair. The audience was greatly shocked. After a long battle, Chen Guangyao got the ball passed down by Cao Guicheng and also made a miraculous achievement. The national army won the first half by three to zero.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Momentum Suddenly Increases</p>
<p>After the break, the line-up was changed and the battle was interesting. The national army's line-up was greatly adjusted and the strength was greatly reduced. The competition was very dull. The West Concession team's momentum suddenly increased and they attacked the national army's goal frequently. Once, Zhou Xianyan ran out to save the ball and did not touch the ball. The ball bounced towards the goal. Liang Yanzan rushed back to sit in and headed the ball out of the line to temporarily retreat. Ackley's corner kick was very good. The West Concession team took the opportunity to chase and kill, but failed to succeed.</p>
<p>Final Victory or Defeat</p>
<p>After fighting for a quarter of an hour, the West Concession team pursued with troops again. The national army's midfield was lost and the rear suddenly became empty. Turner got the ball and shot from a long distance and hit the target. The West Concession team opened the record to a score of three to one. After the West Concession Livingston scored another goal, the audience was worried about the national army. The whole scene suddenly changed and greatly encouraged the national army. Sure enough, in the last few minutes, Ye Beihua hit a goal, and the result was four to two. The national army won. Referee Li Silian.</p>
<h3>Japan's Prediction for the Swimming Competition</h3>
<p>Saying They Will Win the Championship, Our Country Has No Hope</p>
<p>Hoping Our Athletes Will Work Hard to Avenge the Shame</p>
<p>Tokyo Telecommunication The supervisor of the Japanese swimming team attending the Far Eastern Games, Mr. Shirayama Genzaburo, told reporters yesterday about the championship of this conference as follows:</p>
<p>The swimming competition of the Ninth Far Eastern Games will occupy the most important page in the history of Japanese sports, because one is the opening of the Meiji Jingu Swimming Pool, and the other is the anniversary of Japan's revenge and the birth of new records. No one can have any doubt about Japan's victory, and we must not make any predictions that are unfavorable to Japan because of the narrow defeat in Shanghai last time. In 1927, when the Eighth Games were held in Shanghai, the All-American Swimming Competition was also held in Hawaii. Because Japan was invited, it sent a number of first-class athletes, such as Takaishi, to attend. At that time, it paid attention to the international conference and did not let go of the opportunity to enter the world stage. The bitter efforts of the measures can be regarded as appropriate. Japan resolutely recommended some second-class athletes to participate in the Far Eastern Games, which also has a very good reason. One is that there are too many Japanese athletes, and the second-class athletes below usually have few opportunities to compete abroad. It is beneficial for them to gain experience for the future. The second is that their victory proves the terrible progress of the Japanese swimming world and increases Japan's self-confidence. Unfortunately, a group of new middle-level athletes were ultimately weaker, and the unfair judgment reduced their enthusiasm. As a result, they narrowly lost by a narrow margin.</p>
<p>This time, Japan's victory is absolute. It is very happy and there is no fierce competition due to the score. It is particularly worth noting that only Japanese athletes will show excellent performances. It is no exaggeration to say that the 200-meter breaststroke and the 50-meter freestyle are the only highlights of the conference. There are several Japanese athletes who can compete with world-famous athletes in this event. The Philippines only has Irufulo, and China does not have such talent. The 50-meter freestyle is difficult to predict. Some different situations affect the results. This time, there may be unexpected and amazing creations. In addition, the 50-meter has always been the Philippines' forte, so our country cannot be too optimistic. The 200-meter is the same and must be paid considerable attention.</p>
<p>Silver Goblet Presented by the Ministry of Education to the Conference</p>
<p>(Wang Kai Photo)</p>
<p>Tsurude-kun's 200-meter breaststroke can be written as a casual championship, which is recognized by everyone. His record is 2 minutes and 45 seconds. During the Philippine preliminary round, Mr. Irufulo's time was 2 minutes and 52.4 seconds, which cannot be ignored. Mr. Irufulo has a weakness to feeling cold, while Mr. Tsurude's start is slow, but Mr. Tsurude's strength is particularly sufficient. Even if he cannot beat Mr. Irufulo in practice, it is easy to win the final. Now it can be imagined that Mr. Tsurude is flying in front during the final, followed by Arima, Watanabe, Matsumoto, Katsuta, Awata, or Tsukahara Haraokashima. In short, a group of first-class athletes will surround Mr. Ito and stage a fierce competition. As a result, Mr. Ito may get second place or fall to fourth place. At least one person is Mr. Ito's strong enemy at the second finish.</p>
<p>In the 50-meter freestyle, the Philippines' first, Mr. Uluka's, scored 28.2 seconds, so it is said that Japan has nothing to worry about. Miyamoto, Masuda, and Hayakawa all scored around 27 seconds. At the Meiji Jingu competition, Miyamoto was 27.6 seconds (the preliminary round was 27.4 seconds), Masuda 27.6 seconds, Hayakawa 27.8 seconds. Takaishi, Sada, and other capable people, although it is difficult to maintain around 26 seconds, but an average of 27.4 seconds is not a problem. In this way, Mr. Wu's results are not worth mentioning. The 200-meter relay is also the most interesting and can be performed very well.</p>
<p>The next problem is that Mr. Philopillo's score in the 100-meter backstroke is 1 minute and 16.2 seconds. The rest can be imagined. In terms of results, it goes without saying that Irie is the leader in this event. (According to the article, Mr. Irie attended the Out-of-Bounds Games the year before and won the fourth place in the 100-meter backstroke. His record is 1 minute and 13.2 seconds.) The Meiji Jingu preliminary round has confirmed that Mr. Katayama, who will attend the conference this time, is 1 minute and 17.6 seconds, Mr. Matsumura 1 minute and 18.6 seconds, Mr. Oshima 1 minute and 19.6 seconds, Mr. Kimura 1 minute and 17.4 seconds, and Mr. Omoto 1 minute and 18.6 seconds. Other records from Mr. Matsumura Otsuki are also worth watching. When Katayama competed in the East-West middle school against each other last year, Katayama's score was 1 minute and 16.6 seconds. Mr. Katayama will naturally be Mr. Tatsu's rival in the competition for second place this time.</p>

<p>The 100-meter freestyle athletes who have been designated include Mr. Takaishi, Mr. Miyamoto, Mr. Murakami, and Mr. Sada. Mr. Miyamoto, who was initially in third place, has now improved his score to 1 minute and 2.6 seconds. If Mr. Uluka's score is arranged with the Japanese athletes, it will only fall to ninth place. The rest of the Philippine athletes are even less worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The 400-meter and 1,500-meter events go without saying that the result is to let the Chinese and Philippine athletes see the strength of Japan. Secondly, what makes people pay attention is the strength of the athletes since the Japanese public competition last winter. Mr. Takemura of Meiji University advanced the world record with a score of 4 minutes and 52 seconds in the 400-meter event. The score in the 200-meter event is 2 minutes and 17 seconds. Takaishi and Sada also scored 2 minutes and 17 seconds.</p>
<p>Finally, in the public competition, the men's 50-meter, 100-meter, and 1,000-meter freestyle events, the 200-meter backstroke, and the 400-meter breaststroke are all opportunities for the athletes who have not participated in the conference to be active and show their skills. The magnificence of the swimming kingdom will shock the world. For women, Japan will be proud in the 50-meter, 100-meter, 200-meter, and 400-meter freestyle events, the 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke events.</p>
<p>In short, there is no doubt that this time's victory belongs to Japan. There may be a fierce battle between the Philippines and Japan. China's swimming is really too young and it is difficult to have activities.</p>

<h3>Three Middle School Joint Sports Meet</h3>
<p>Yan Cheng Wins Team and Individual Championships</p>
<p>The three middle school sports meets of John's Middle School, Suzhou Yan Cheng, and Taowu were held in John's University on the 12th and 13th. Suzhou Yan Cheng's sports have always been famous, and John's is also an outstanding figure in the field, so the ownership of the championship should be competed for by these two schools. As a result of the two-day sports meet, Yan Cheng scored 78 points, John scored 70 points, and Taowu scored 14 points. The championship was won by Yan Cheng, and the individual championship was won by Cheng Jinguang, a dark horse from the school who represented China in the Far Eastern Games. Although the scores of each event were reduced due to the rain, Cheng Jinguang's 200-meter (23.8 seconds) and Yan Cheng's long-distance running star Shao Maochun's 3,000-meter and 1,500-meter scores were outstanding and added color to the meeting. The basketball teams of John's and Yan Cheng played a friendly match in John's gymnasium at 8:00 p.m. on the 13th. Yan Cheng's players Xue Binglin and Zhou Zili were unable to attend due to illness, and were replaced by a mixed team of Yan Cheng and Taowu. As a result, they still won John's with 28 to 19.</p>

The average age of the players on both sides was only ten years old. It was really a spectacle to line up and compete to be the first to score. In the first half, the strength of both sides was evenly matched and they did not score anything. In the second half, Mengtong made persistent efforts and scored three goals in a row. Guanghua's forward also rushed in and scored a goal before the ceasefire order, creating a score of three to one.</p>

<h3>Laughing It Off, A Shanghai Resident</h3>
<p>A｜｜Old Wang got engaged yesterday. I heard it was a completely love-based union.</p>
<p>B｜｜But I heard she comes from a poor family and doesn't have any money, so her clothes are very simple.</p>
<p>C｜｜I heard that she hasn't received a high level of education, so her knowledge is limited.</p>
<p>D｜｜I heard that her body isn't healthy either, and she often looks pale and thin without any color.</p>
<p>A｜｜But she has one unique advantage: she has no parents and hardly any relatives.</p>
<p>Housewife (questioning the maid)｜Are you blind? Didn't you see? Where did that huge spider web in the living room come from?</p>
<p>Maid｜｜Madam, don't you know? It was made by a spider.</p>
<p>Teacher｜｜All good people can go to heaven in the future. Children, do you all want to go to heaven?</p>
<p>All the students raise their hands except one.</p>
<p>Teacher｜｜Eh? Child, don't you want to be a good person and go to heaven?</p>
<p>Student｜｜It's not that. It's because my mother told me that as soon as I leave the school gate, I have to go home immediately and not go anywhere else.</p>
<p>Mother｜｜Child, don't always say your younger brother is lying. You're lying yourself.</p>
<p>Child｜｜I just did it once in a while to see if you'd believe it or not.</p>
<h3>Trivial News About the Funeral of Madam Yu, Compiled by Sun</h3>
<p>Madam Fang, the mother of Yu Qiaqing, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, received the post on the ninth of this month at Longshan, Sanbei. Thousands of people from various ports including Shanghai, Hangzhou, Beijing, and Ningbo went to hold the ropes. Therefore, I will record what I have seen and heard below to enrich the Free Talk section.</p>
<p>Situation en route: The Yu residence is several hundred miles away from Shanghai, and transportation is inherently inconvenient. This time, due to Yu's careful arrangements, it was still relatively convenient. Certificates and boat tickets were distributed to the guests in advance. The New Jiangtian and Ningxing ferries were equipped with Yu's funeral affairs offices to facilitate reception. At 5 PM on the eighth, the two ferries departed from Shanghai. The next morning, they arrived in Zhenhai. Three ferries, from Yaobei, Cibei, and Zhenbei, were ordered to transfer the guests to the Longshan wharf. They then switched to the small train prepared by Yu himself, traveling for about ten minutes to reach Longshan. Two cars, forty sedan chairs, thirty rickshaws, and dozens of small boats were provided, rotating to transport people to the Yu residence. People were dispatched along the way to provide reception, and it was known that the car and chair bearers were wearing Yu's attire.</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Yu Residence: Because there were many guests this time, the Yu residence specially installed a generator for 5,000 electric lights, as well as running water and wireless telegraph. A tall white cloth canopy, about a hundred yards long, was erected in front of the gate. Two colorful buildings, four yards high, were built on both sides, with music pavilions on top for welcoming and sending off guests. To the left was Taiping Bridge, and to the right was Tianxu Bridge. Large white silk triangular flags were erected on the bridges, with large black characters such as "memorial ceremony" written on them in black velvet dog-tooth edges, fluttering in the wind, which was quite spectacular. Under the canopy were arranged many ten thousand people umbrellas, virtue government plaques, and other items. Next to the ancestral hall were hung elegiac couplets and mourning streamers from important party and state figures such as Chiang Kai-shek, Cai Yuanpei, and Yu Youren, which were numerous.</p>
<p>Crowded Mourners: According to Ningbo customs, those who came to mourn with a memorial text were considered the most respectful. This time, the provincial governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang under the National Government, Commander Xiong of Shanghai, Mayor Zhang, Mayor Yang of Ningbo, Commander Wang, as well as county chiefs, bureau chiefs, and heads of offices, either sent representatives to attend or personally held the ropes. Therefore, from morning to night on the ninth, the public memorial services of various institutions and groups never stopped. Each public memorial service was chanted by the master of ceremonies, accompanied by high-pitched singing and ceremonial music such as offering sacrifices, so the masters of ceremonies and musicians complained incessantly.</p>
<p>A Trivial Matter</p>
<p>A few days ago, I went to Jianggan for business and visited West Lake along the way. When the boat arrived at Orioles Singing in the Willows, I disembarked. It was lunchtime at Lou Wai Lou. There was a dish of water shield soup, which was extremely delicious. I examined the water shield, which is not only produced in West Lake, but also in Xiang Lake and Jian Lake in Shaoxing, Yuan Lake in Jiaxing, Ling Lake in Wuxing, Nan Lake in Yuhang, and Tai Lake in Suzhou. However, compared with several places, the ones produced in West Lake are the best. In the Jin Dynasty, Zhang Jiaying thought of water shield soup and said, "Life values contentment. How can I be bound by officialdom for thousands of miles to seek fame and fortune?" From then on, it became a good story, and his spirit of retiring bravely is truly unattainable.</p>
<p>Water shield, also known as water sunflower, is a vegetable with oval-shaped leaves and long stalks with a sticky liquid between the stems and leaves, so it is used to make soup. Those who visit West Lake often praise the deliciousness of water shield soup, probably because the water source of West Lake is clear and mirror-like, and the nourishment received by the water shield is also unique.</p>
<p>The Scene of the Send-Off: The send-off took place at 10 AM on the tenth. In addition to the ordinary honor guards, there were also living-body lanterns, incense burners, peacock pavilions, small local operas, etc. It is said that the old customs of Sanbei originally had a festival every year. Since the National Government banned it, it has not been held for three years. This time, the funeral of Madam Yu saw all the nearby communities pooling funds to join in the send-off because she had been able to help people solve their problems and eliminate the bad habit of fighting. The honor guards stretched eight or nine miles long through places like Yuxing Village and Longtouchang. The spectators along the way all said that it was more grand than the previous festivals.</p>
<p>Food and Accommodation: The number of mourners this time was rarely seen in the world. Longxing Village has never had inns or restaurants, so the two matters of food and accommodation were the most difficult to solve this time. The food and drink were handled by four kitchens in Shanghai and Ningbo. In addition to Chinese food, there was also a Western food department. It was originally planned to open six hundred tables per day, but because the number of guests exceeded the budget, it was necessary to open one thousand tables per day. Due to insufficient manpower, meals were served in two shifts, causing those who ate later to drool with desire. The Yu residence is very large, covering more than ten acres. There were originally three hundred beds, and one thousand camp beds were temporarily added. Each room was set up with fifteen beds, and the bedding was all white, similar to a hospital. The other security regiments and others were all housed on the floor.</p>
<p>Petty Merchants Profited: The Yu residence faces a small river that leads to Yuyao Zhouxiang. Since the ninth, the remote town suddenly became lively. Boats were bought and came, mooring like a weaving. The waterway was blocked. Petty merchants speculated in renting boats to provide accommodation and building sheds to sell wine and food, resulting in names such as floating residence and temporary hotel. Others such as magic lantern shows, boxing, selling vermicelli, and fruit stalls were everywhere. On the tenth and eleventh, four troupes from the Shanghai Zhonghua Public Orchid Society, Yage Collection, Lu He, etc., performed operas at the Yu residence and the Yu family ancestral hall and the Yu mother's special ancestral hall to celebrate Madam Yu's ninetieth birthday, so crowds gathered and petty merchants profited a lot.</p>
<h3>Touring the Slender West Lake in Yangzhou, by Li Yu</h3>
<p>Arriving in Yangzhou, I feel the decline is even more severe than before. I indulge in reverie, imagining that the transportation of airplanes will be a great success, or that there will be more convenient means of transportation. Shanghai, which flourished due to shipping, will also be like Yangzhou, which failed in canal transportation. Boating on this lake, I feel that the natural scenery is not different from the past, and I indulge in reverie again, imagining that the material civilization that has won victory through rare brain ideas will ultimately not be as important as the Eastern thought of valuing nature. The majestic traces of the arena of beast fighting have disappeared, but the grass of the Nile River is eternally green.</p>
<p>This lake has shallow water and mountains are close. It resembles West Lake, but it is slender, hence the name Slender West Lake. It borders the ancient city, and the city is like its screen, but it has collapsed and is not repaired. The power of nature takes advantage of the void to enter, and moss and weeds grow luxuriantly, as if covered with green felt. There are three places worth visiting on the shore today: First, the Green Willow Village, with its winding stream for drinking, is shaded by dense foliage, similar to White Heron Island in Jinling. However, different kinds of camellias are in bloom, lined up to welcome people, as if showing the special products of the place, which is quite enjoyable. Second, the Xu Baoshan Shrine. The shrine is like a home and garden. The halls are decorated with many sculptures of ancient roots in the shape of immortals and Buddhas. There is also a carved bamboo forest window made of jujube wood. The bamboo stems are intricately jointed, no different from real bamboo leaves piled up in patterns.</p>
<h3>Compilation of Pear News From North and South</h3>
<p>Student Xun, returning north, has already been two months. Letters have been rare, and news has been scarce. Yesterday, I received a letter from Student Xun from Beijing, describing the recent situation in detail. I will record the original letter in place of a description. The letter said, "I lingered in Shanghai for three months. I am deeply grateful for your care and concern. After we parted, I was fortunate to receive blessings and had a smooth journey. The boat arrived in Dalian, and I was invited by local celebrities to gather, so I stayed for a day. Three to five hundred people came to welcome and send me off at the pier, which made me feel very ashamed and frightened. On the fourth of the month, I arrived safely in Beijing. The wine for washing away the dust is a must at several places every day. This body is almost entirely used for socializing. I have long intended to pay my respects and inquire about your well-being, as well as express my gratitude, but I have had no free time, so I have delayed until today. I am very sorry. The manager of the China Company in Tianjin firmly insisted on my staying to perform when I passed through Tianjin, which was irresistible. It is scheduled to perform for five consecutive days starting from the 26th of this month. The plays are Selling Horses, Embroidered Jacket, Double Beauty, Fragrant Silk Belt, and Fish Algae Palace. I am planning to go to Tianjin on the 23rd and 24th to rest for a while and then take the stage on time. The Beijing theaters, such as Kaiming, Zhonghe, Jixiang, and the First Stage, have also been inviting me for days, but nothing has been decided yet. I must wait until I return from Tianjin before discussing everything. I know of your concern and am reporting this to you."</p>
<p>Shang Xiaoyun's independently organized Xieqing Society's male actor is Yang Baozhong. Recently, Shang and Yang have suddenly become incompatible, so Baozhong has taken the initiative to request to leave this month. Xiaoyun has reached an agreement with Tan Fuying and Guo Zhongheng to join and cooperate. They will perform at the Jixiang Garden on the 23rd and 24th. Fuying's artistry has improved recently, and Xiaoyun has found him to be helpful, which can be said to be discerning.</p>
<p>Kunling Zhang Eyun has been very popular recently. She will cooperate with Wang Youchen and go to Chunhe, Tianjin, for a short engagement. Yuan Baocun and Doushan Shanren are supporting her very much.</p>
<p>The Chengnan Amusement Park is a place for creating successful Kunling actors. Jin Shaomei, Rong Lijuan, Qin Xuefang, and Meng Lijun have all become famous by performing in the Amusement Park. In recent years, the business of the park has not been as prosperous as it was a few years ago. Only the Beijing Opera theater can maintain its old appearance and has endured for a long time. The main actor invited last year was the rising star Jin Youqin, who performed for half a year and also achieved great success. Now that Youqin's contract has expired, she will soon be replaced by Zhao Meiying. Although Meiying is a bit older, she is still very popular, and her performance should not be inferior to Youqin's.</p>
<p>Jin Shaomei has not appeared in public for a long time since her mother, Yuemei, passed away. Recently, due to financial difficulties, she has had to return to her old profession. Before this, she went to the capital for more than a month and was able to cause a sensation for a period of time. After her contract was completed, she went to the Tianchan Stage in Zhenjiang for a week and also won a lot of praise. She returned to Shanghai from Zhenjiang a few days ago for a short rest and then went to Qingdao to perform. The people there have always had a good impression of Shaomei, and her future performance should be considerable.</p>
<p>Kun actor male actor Yu Guifen, in view of the fact that male actors do not make money, will leave the male actor profession and learn Huashan from now on. She is currently looking for a teacher and will implement the change of profession soon.</p>
<p>A certain stage in Shanghai sent someone to Beijing to invite Wang Yaoqing's favorite student, Du Liyun. Liyun was not interested in going south at the time, so she asked for a high price to reject the offer. It is heard that Liyun's asking price was six thousand gold, while the stage's counter-offer was three thousand five hundred yuan. The difference is too large, and it is feared that it will be difficult to come to fruition.</p>
<p>Famous director Wang Changlin is seventy-four years old. Since this year, his spirit has been declining. Last month, he caught a cold and lay in bed for two weeks. After the doctor's proper treatment, he felt a little better. At the end of last month, his grandson (Fushan's son) died of acute febrile disease. Wang cried so much that his illness worsened again and became very serious. It is feared that there is no hope of saving him. His family is already preparing for the aftermath.</p>
<p>The beauty of the Mei Jian is admired for a long time as a rare masterpiece among carvings. It is a pity that the author, Mr. He, is not known. The Sanpingshan Hall is built on a hill, overlooking the arrogance. There is a temple in the ring, offering a stone carving of Ouyang Xiu. The clothes are line-carved, and the face is like a Western-style relief, which is also rare. I asked the monks and got a rubbing, but when I opened it, the concavity and convexity were completely lost. In between, the carved columns are extremely fine, and the shapes of the piles and rulers change. Although they are not as skillful as piling clouds and building jade, they have exhausted the beauty of the lattice pattern carvings. Moreover, they have survived the flames of war completely without missing parts, as if protected by gods. Or perhaps the exquisiteness of the art is enough to move the violent guests and make them reluctant to destroy it? Although the vicissitudes of life are easy, the exquisite art often leaves its immortal life to illuminate future generations. It is also the preciousness of art. The colors of the entire hall are matched with pink and malachite green, but they are already dimmed. I don't know if they are colors. They are the most fashionable colors in France. Beside it, there is a winding path to a garden. The mountains and rocks in the garden are all piled up with rectangular ones, which are very similar to the mountains of calcite, which is different from the ordinary ones made of round stones. It can be seen that the ingenuity of the literati in the past is even more. There is a crane tomb, as the legend says, but I did not have time to see it. My friend Wu Ziwenyan is suggesting that this lake be changed into a park and has asked for a design. If it is closely modeled after the Zhaofeng Garden on the Shanghai waterfront, taking the wilderness of nature, removing the hazel and weeds, straightening the trees and planting them, and adding a little embellishment, a beautiful place can be created without spending 100,000 gold. I very much hope that it will be realized soon.</p>
<p>In the lake, there used to be women rowing boats, and now they are occasionally seen, but they are all imitating fashionable short shirts and wide trousers. The wild grass and free flowers have been trampled almost to the end. It's a pity, a pity.</p>
<h3>British Art Study Notes, by Wang Yachen, sent from London</h3>
<p>In early spring, the leaves sprout and the weather in Paris has brightened from the gloom. I received a letter from a friend in London that there is an exhibition of famous Italian paintings at the London Academy of Fine Arts. I invited the painter Wu Hengqin to arrive in London in mid-March. The morning from Paris to London arrives in the evening. After arriving, the weather has been clear for more than ten days. I have visited various museums, art galleries, and world-famous buildings in London one after another. I am overwhelmed. Now I will briefly record the art study notes below:</p>
<p>1.  The National Gallery is located in the center of London, near the palace. The gallery displays more than 4,000 famous works. Famous works from various European countries since the Renaissance are on display, especially the collection of Italian, Dutch, and Spanish works. A large new display room has recently been opened, dedicated to hanging hundreds of Renaissance paintings. The richness of the British collection can be compared with that of France.</p>
<p>2.  The Taie Gallery is the most magnificent building among the art galleries in London. The gallery is divided into twenty-five rooms for displaying paintings. Except for three rooms of French Impressionist works, the rest are all famous works of British modern and even contemporary art. The scope of the exhibition is as large as that of the National Gallery mentioned above. I am here specifically to study British paintings, so I will briefly record British paintings below for the reference of domestic comrades.</p>
<p>British painting showed a significant realistic characteristic in the middle of the eighteenth century. At that time, Turner and Constable opened up new faces in landscape painting with naturalism. The gallery has a special display of several rooms of each painter's works. British paintings in the early eighteenth century still inherited the painting with nature as the object, which was actually initiated by the two. Turner's works are characterized by depicting the characteristics of water vapor, light, and air, realistic in the early period and freehand in the later period. Constable's works use faithful expression to nature, and although the goals are the same as Turner's, the techniques are different. The paintings of the modern European realist and naturalist schools were actually initiated by the two.</p>
<p>Before Turner, there were two major British painters that we cannot forget, namely Reynolds and Gainsborough. In the early eighteenth century, British painting was completely influenced by the Italian and Dutch styles, with thousands of paintings being the same and lacking change. However, Reynolds' works, although inheriting the painting style of the Dutch master Van Dyck, mainly used realism in the description and never described literary and fanciful themes. Reynolds left more than 4,000 portrait paintings, and his great expressive power can be regarded as the first British portrait painter.</p>
<p>Gainsborough's works are good at depicting forests and also rely on nature as the return. His techniques and observation of nature are unmatched except for the French landscape painter Corot. Today, people often call Ganshi the teacher of naturalism.</p>
<p>After Turner, the British created the Pre-Raphaelite school, whose central figure was Rossetti. Luo was a writer and painter. His famous works include "Dante's Dream". The gallery has a large room with about twenty points dedicated to depicting fantasy styles that are soft and biased towards literary taste. The power of painting itself is inevitably weak. At that time, romanticism was popular in France. Luo's works can be compared with the French Delacroix in terms of taste, but the strength of their techniques is far different.</p>

<p>The Bullish Silver Dollar Market Persists</p>
<p>Market Overview: The silver dollar market's momentum can be described as extremely prosperous in the current financial situation.

<p>The Gold Market Changes in an Instant</p>
<p>Banks Absorb Spot Goods</p>
<p>Closing at 22 Taels 8 Mace</p>
<p>Up 9 Mace From Yesterday</p>
<p>Industry Players Are Confused</p>
<p>There Were Over 5 Taels of Twists and Turns</p>
<p>Sometimes High, Sometimes Low, Deviating From the Norm: Yesterday's gold labeling situation continued to soar, but it changed thousands of times in an instant, with twists and turns that were often difficult to grasp. The environment was very dangerous, and the psychology of industry players was confused and uncertain. In the morning market, there were actually differences of five taels and zero ginseng. In the afternoon market, there were still plans to wield the rod for two taels. The exchange rate trend was tight, and the result seemed to be withering. The selling sentiment among industry players was very strong, such as Taixing, Hengxing, Yongtai, and Dadecheng. However, Wanxing, Yuan Maoyong, and Yuantai all bought in. Since the large long notes continued to shrink from the morning market, a peak was seen. Afterwards, the exchange rate repeatedly shrunk a notch, and the buyers in the market became active, so it jumped thousands of feet, deviating from the norm and actually jumping to an unprecedented high peak price of five hundred and twenty-six taels. Afterwards, large customers from all sides rushed to sell, and with the exchange rate changing to loosening, it turned into a downwind, with strong waves falling sharply by more than five taels. Hengxing and Dadecheng actively sold in the afternoon market, while the buyers were zero customers. As for the slight fluctuations in the market situation, only the exchange rate was suspended as usual on Wednesday. The result was around five hundred and twenty-three taels.</p>
<p>A new peak of 26 taels appeared. London silver bars were reduced by sixteen points, and the silver price was reduced by one-half. The opening of the gold labeling in June added eight mace to five hundred and twenty-two taels seven mace. The gross price rose from twenty-one taels three mace to twenty-four taels, and the buyers were prosperous. Banks had deposited it. It is estimated that the recent British gold was ten pence two five. Afterwards, the current month's gold and others absorbed ten pence three one two five. Therefore, when the initial announcement was made, it was twenty-four taels with zero hanging price, and it was reduced by one two five US dollars two corners five. Japanese gold added half a point and then rose to four taels eight nine mace. Then, it was reduced by seven or eight mace, and Mitsui and Shanghai mutually did July ten pence two five. Then, HSBC and others absorbed two five, and the recent bank counter-did one two five suddenly changed the abbreviation to one two five US dollars two corners half. Japanese gold added seventy-five points and suddenly presented a peak. At more than nine fifty points, it was estimated to reach twenty-six taels. However, it was a fleeting moment and immediately turned downstream. It was actually a large customer who actively sold it, and the bank counter-did the British gold for the next month at ten pence two five, which fell sharply by three taels. At ten points and three quarters, it was two taels eight mace. After more than ten minutes, it only added one tael and then added to four taels seven eight mace. Suddenly, the selling sentiment did not stop, and the people's hearts were lowered. It fell again by three or four taels and once fell to twenty taels and zero eight mace. However, the closing price at noon was twenty-one taels six mace. It was difficult to speculate on the fate of the city.</p>
<p>The fluctuations in the afternoon market were slightly smooth. The afternoon market opened at five hundred and twenty-two taels one two mace. Afterwards, it added from twenty-one taels four mace to twenty-three taels one mace due to the Indian exchange rate report shrinking. After three o'clock, the seller's activity receded by more than one tael to twenty-one taels eight mace. Afterwards, it was heard that the bank absorbed spot gold labeling, so the people's hearts returned to firmness, and the increase was raised by more than one tael. After four o'clock, it was twenty-three taels four mace. Finally, the scalper trading slightly sold it and suppressed a small number of mace. The closing price at four twenty points was five hundred and twenty-two taels eight mace, which was nine mace higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>In the end, a small thirteen taels were made. The maximum price during the day was twenty-six taels, and the minimum price was twenty-four taels eight mace, a difference of five taels two mace. The initial announced price was five hundred and thirty-two taels two mace, which was suppressed by seven or eight taels. Afterwards, it was changed to five hundred and thirty-five taels eight mace due to the addition of one tael one mace one fen to the Japanese gold. It is estimated that ten taels to more than fourteen taels are pressed. In the afternoon, it is estimated that thirteen taels are pressed. The accounts for this month have been settled, so it is not counted. June is twenty-two taels, supplementing the water to twenty-four taels to twenty-five taels. The articles were opened early at twenty-two taels six mace and closed at noon at twenty-one taels seven mace. The afternoon twenty-two taels closed at twenty-two taels nine mace.</p>
<p>The market transactions were booming, and the buying and selling among the industry players was quite prosperous. It is estimated that Yuan Maoyong, Yuantai, Wanxing, Taifeng, Yuancheng, Huiyuan, etc. have all entered, and Hengxing, Shengda, Yuancheng Yong, Yongkang, Yongda, Yufa Yong, Taixing, Dadecheng, Yuda, Tianyu Yong, etc. have all sold. In the afternoon, Huiyuan, Xiangyu, Yuancheng Yong, Yuda, Wanxing, Zhifeng Yong, etc. have all bought in. Shengda, Hengxing, Yuan Maoyong, Dadecheng, Taifengcheng, Yuantai, etc. have all sold.

Sumitomo in Shanghai took in the amount. As for Japanese gold transactions, they were sluggish, with only a few 100,000 yuan in volume. Chase Bank sold slightly.

As for the changes in the various bonds, due to optimistic news about the situation, the market sentiment was good, and the investment and buying activities of all parties were very active, so the bond prices also rose accordingly. The Subsequent Large Bonds only rose by 20-30 cents because the price was already very high, except for the demobilization, which rose by over 2 yuan. The tariff and abolition bonds rose by about 1.5 yuan, and the others also rose by about 1 yuan.

<p>The Silent Yarn Market Amidst Quiet Actual Sales</p>
<p>The yarn market rose slightly, but the situation was still sluggish. This was because actual sales were not smooth, the situation was not good, and the communist bandits were harassing various places, so the yarn was greatly affected. Therefore, people outside the industry had no intention of going long, and the buying interest was dim. Only a certain manufacturer maintained a firm attitude and remained still. However, the overall trend was still a revolving situation.</p>
<p>Retail Speculators Cover Shorts, Rise Slightly. The opening price of the previous session of the human standard was average. The rise and fall of American cotton were mixed. The No. 50 was sold in the near month and the No. 34 was covered, so the market sentiment did not change much. Retail speculators covered their shorts due to the soaring gold price, and each rose by two, three, or four cents. The afternoon market was still flat. The current month did not move, and the distant months rose by one, two, or three cents. There was not much raw yarn business. The closing price of the third-grade yarn fell by 2 yuan, and the human sentiment after closing was average. The total transaction volume for the day was 5,450 bales. The closing prices of the human standard are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Japanese Yarn Selling Prices Changed Lower, Raw Yarn Sales Sluggish. Various gangs bought 820 bales, and only 150 bales were received from colleagues. The market was flat, and the Guangdong gang's purchasing appetite was still the best, totaling 470 bales. In addition, 125 bales were received from the inland, 25 bales from Sichuan, 15 bales from Ningbo, 45 bales from Xiamen, 55 bales from Jiangxi, 25 bales from Nanyang, 25 bales from Tianjin, and 35 bales from miscellaneous gangs. The selling price of Japanese yarn fell by 2.5 cents to 5 cents, it was said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Driven Up by Gold Price</h3>
<p>The cotton market was still firm. Telegrams from American cotton showed mixed rises and falls, but Indian cotton rose again, and the gold price soared, and the exchange rate contracted strangely, driving up sentiment. Therefore, the situation of new cotton in October was quite firm, but actual sales were very quiet. Various factories were watching and not moving, and even Japanese businessmen and Dongmian did not take action.</p>
<p>The forward market was uniquely strong. The opening situation of the Chinese Standard in the exchange was very firm. Due to the rising Indian cotton, retail speculators covered their shorts, and each month rose by 5 cents to 1.5 cents. October alone rose by 3 cents. The afternoon market was still high. The current month rose by another 5 cents, and the distant months fell back by 5 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 17,800 dan. The closing prices of the Chinese Standard are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Actual Sales Were Quiet, Raw Cotton News Was Dull. Various factories had no intention to handle the sources, and the supply continued. It is estimated that 500 bales of Yao cotton and 90 bales of Tong cotton arrived. The sales records are on the left.</p>
<p>Yao cotton, 31.50 to 31.80, Yokohama gang received 400 bales, spot goods warehouse delivery. Tong cotton, 36.20, 90 bales received among colleagues, spot goods warehouse delivery.</p>
<h3>Overseas Yarn and Cotton Rises and Falls Differently</h3>
<p>Old Cotton Rebounds by More Than Twenty Pounds. Yesterday, the American cotton market was mixed due to the closing of long and short positions. It is estimated that old cotton rose by 24 to 29 pounds, new cotton fell by 6 to 9 pounds, and spot goods rose by 25 pounds. English cotton futures rose by 11 to 14 points, and spot goods rose by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods did not move. Indian cotton was firm due to purchases by Japan at the close. It is estimated that Pingle rose by 5 rupees, and the forward price rose by 3 rupees. Aumra rose by 4 rupees, and the forward price rose by 3 rupees. Ba Luo Creek's near and forward prices rose by 4 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 13th).</p>

<p>Silk and Tea. New Silk Quietly Awaits Telegram Transfer</p>
<p>Yesterday, various silk merchants in this port eagerly sought to sell new silk as new cocoons from Zhejiang were shipped to Shanghai in batches. Various European firms sent out many telegrams for new futures silk in the sixth and seventh months in response to the requests of various manufacturers. They are now quietly awaiting telegram transfer, but the result is still difficult to be optimistic due to the unstable exchange rate. Yesterday, only Lienar and others received 30 packages of Shanghai White Factory, and Zhonghe received 20 packages of White Dried Silk, both at average prices.</p>
<h3>The Price of Cocoons in Tangqi Returns to Fifty Yuan</h3>
<p>The surrounding silk factories in Tangqi and Genshanmen have rented factories to collect cocoons. The opening scale has been for two or three days. The initial price of cocoons was 50 yuan, which then rose to 55 or 56 yuan. Now, due to heavy rain all day, the amount of goods arriving on the market is not crowded, and the price of cocoons is looking tired. Yesterday, it has returned to 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Flood of Silkworms in the Lake Region Is Still Rarely Lost</h3>
<p>In the old prefecture of Huzhou, Wuxing, Changxing, Deqing, Wukang, Anji, and other counties, although the cold areas and near the lake, this year the number of silkworm ants raised has been reduced due to the unrest of bandits, but the silkworm breeding in the near city and various markets and towns is still prosperous. After the second molt, the weather suddenly became cold and hot, and it was rainy. The silkworm farmers tried their best to take care of them, and the impact was only slightly affected by the large number of foreign species. The loss is still rare. Now it is a large number of large molts and prosperous leaves. If the weather is sunny and does not change, a good harvest of new cocoons can be expected. However, the price of leaves is not cheap, 4 yuan 56 cents in the city and 3 yuan 78 cents in the countryside.</p>
<h3>Fuliang Green Tea Has Been Opened</h3>
<p>The green tea in the southeastern townships of Fuliang this year was bought by foreign shops and tea merchants who rushed to the mountains to search for it earlier due to the early climate. Tea vendors in Wuyuan stayed in Fuliang to collect and bake Guyu Mao Feng due to the shortage of Wuyuan tea production this year. A large number of new leaves with fine and tender branches and deep fragrance had been produced at the end of last month. Yesterday, new samples of first tea (before the beginning of summer) were released in places such as Siqian Nan'an Tan, and the price was offered from 82 yuan to 65 yuan per dan depending on the quality of the leaves. However, the buyers found it difficult to accept the high price. Yesterday, the weather cleared for the past two days, and the mountain households were still picking and making tea. However, after the beginning of summer, the branches and leaves became hard and loose, and the price in the future must be lower than the first tea. (8th)</p>
<p>Food River Down Rice Market Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than a dozen ships came from the inside of the Zhabei gate, and the market sales were very good. The price of northern japonica rice was up. High-quality japonica rice did not move due to its high position, while medium-grade rice rose by 20 cents. Old and substandard rice also had a good trend of about 10 cents. The japonica rice market has now been transformed and improved. If the mainland rises again due to lack of arrival, it may become tight. Currently, the top price is still around 21 yuan. The arrival of Bo Dao rice was slightly abundant, and the sales in this street were sluggish. The price remained at the original level. Yang Du pointed to the stagnant sales and lack of transformation. In addition, the customer gangs had foreign rice in their hands, so there was no smooth progress. Although the sources were limited, the overall situation was flat. The transformation yuan market was sluggish and had few transactions. The price opened high at 18 yuan. The Guanzuo temporarily showed stability.</p>
<p>About 10 boats arrived in the South of Shanghai and the street sales were slightly active. Changxi Northern Japonica rice was high and smooth, and customers for the second-grade goods shouted high prices due to the brisk sales in the North Market, resulting in tightness. Due to the medium-grade goods of Su Tongji Japonica rice, the purchasing appetite was flat and the market turned stable. The source of thin early rice such as the green top steamers on the South Road was not strong. The inventory continued to increase due to sluggish sales. However, the production price was quite firm, and it was not easy for the Shanghai market to go downstream. High-quality goods cost 18 yuan and 56 cents. The sales of Yang Jian were rare and the general transformation was negative. The customer appetite was slightly smooth, so the buying interest was slightly active and the price was firm.</p>
<h3>Tapioca Market Continues to Be Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tapioca market showed a strong trend again. In this month, the outside short sellers have been shaken due to special relationships, and they are all seeking to cover their positions in various markets, so the transactions are very smooth. As for the long side, the main purpose is to push up the price, but at this time of high rice and expensive firewood, if the price is raised too much, it is necessary to prevent unexpected setbacks. Therefore, if the short side gradually covers their positions and no longer competes to push up the price, or two or three points, one level can be steadily maintained. Otherwise, it seems easy to artificially push up the market price at a time when the new and old are not connected. The people's hearts are also seeing a good trend in the distant months because the recent months continue to be good. However, the general key of new powder is still to see whether the wheat harvest is abundant or not. As a result, this month was 5% better than the previous day. The six and seven months were 7% better. August was 5% better. September was unchanged. October was not opened.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Difficult to Loosen Before New Crop</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market showed a trend of initial flatness and subsequent firmness. At the initial opening, the people's hearts were very flat because the weather was still good, and the opening price was similar to the previous day. However, later, because inland customers saw that the tapioca market continued to be strong, the future of the wheat market must be good, so the buying interest recovered smoothly and the market continued to rise step by step. Seeing this situation, it was good to see rain before, but now the sunny weather is very good, and the people's hearts are also driven by the tapioca market, so the buyers will not let go before the new wheat is seen. As a result, June rose by 3% compared with the previous day. August rose by 2%. September rose by 1%. October had no comparison. Currently, the stock of raw wheat is not abundant and the factory appetite has also stopped slightly, and the price is stable. Bengbu wheat, Xuzhou wheat, and Qingjiangpu wheat opened at 5 taels and 1 mace, totaling 1,000 packages, and were handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>Over Forty Thousand Bags of Raw Foreign Rice Opened</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the market atmosphere for foreign rice was very strong. The buying appetite of the Yangtze River gang was particularly strong. The appetite of the Hankou and Jiangxi gangs was even stronger. Various routes in Zhejiang Province and the inland of Jiangsu Province also inquired more, resulting in a transaction volume of more than 40,000 bags, and the price rose immediately by 10-20 cents. In the afternoon, various gangs stopped handling, and some even returned some, and people's hearts shook, and the price also returned slightly. As a result, it rose little compared with the previous day, but the transaction became brisk. Min Dang rice opened 20,000 bags, Xiao Jiao spot and route goods 15,000 bags, Saigon No. 1 and 2 5,000 bags, Da Jiao 3,000 bags, and Qiela Di brown rice only 600 bags.</p>

<h3>Yesterday Gold Prices Soared</h3>
<p>Morning High of Five Hundred and Twenty-Six Taels</p>
<p>The Da Wan Bao said that since the New York big silver price on Tuesday fell from 41.625 cents at the closing on Monday to 41.125 cents, the London big silver price also fell from 19.25 pence at the closing on Monday to 19.1875 pence, the gold price in this port was greatly affected yesterday. The opening was 522 taels and 7 mace, and soon it rose to 526 taels, an unprecedentedly high price. But later it fell very quickly, and by noon closing, it had fallen to 521 taels and 6 mace. The opening in the afternoon saw another rise, and the closing was 522 taels and 8 mace, not much different from the opening in the morning. It is reported that the wild rise and fall of gold prices yesterday was mainly due to the fact that speculators have thrown out too much recently and are eager to cover their positions. Therefore, the gold exchange on Jiujiang Road was very active. As for foreign exchange, it also shrank greatly due to the brisk rise in gold prices. The US dollar was 44 yuan and 75 cents, and the sterling was one shilling and ten pence 125. Each US dollar was worth about 3 yuan 1 dime and 1 cent in national currency. Later, it continued to shorten, it was said.</p>
<h3>Sino-French Vietnam Trade Agreement</h3>

He himself will soon return to the north to end the embassy transfer affairs and is expected to go directly to Tokyo from Peiping at the beginning of next month, it was said.</p>
<h3>City Health Bureau to Start Today</h3>
<p>Holding a Hygiene Campaign</p>
<p>The City Health Bureau, in accordance with the Ministry of Health's scheduled date, will hold the fifth hygiene campaign on the 15th of this month. It is reported that in addition to drafting notices on important aspects of public health and publishing announcements in newspapers to encourage citizens to cooperate and strive for implementation, the bureau also plans to repaint the advertising boards in various parts of the city and add various texts and illustrations related to public health in order to attract the attention of citizens. It is also reported that the bureau is paying close attention to street cleaning and plans to hold a street cleaner's general cleaning competition during this hygiene campaign period, with rewards to encourage participation. It is further reported that the bureau has already agreed with the Party headquarters to assist in the publicity work for this campaign.</p>
<p>In order to enable all citizens to understand the true meaning of public health and avoid stagnation in its implementation, the City Health Bureau Director Hu issued a letter to the citizens for the fifth hygiene campaign. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Fellow citizens, the four words "public health" must be familiar to everyone, but what exactly is public health? What is the purpose of public health work? I am afraid that many people still do not understand. Now, let me talk to you about the true meaning of public health work. Simply put, it is to prevent and treat all diseases, maintain everyone's health, increase the lifespan of the people, and create a healthy nation. These are the true meanings of public health, and they are also the purpose of carrying out public health work. From the above points, everyone should understand the importance of public health. However, public health is a whole, and it requires cooperation from the public and maintenance by everyone to be successful. If one only cares about oneself and ignores the public, it will be destroyed by a few people. Even if there are responsible health administrative agencies leading the way, they often encounter obstacles and double the difficulty of implementation, making it impossible to achieve rapid progress. Therefore, everyone must know that only by implementing hygiene rules in personal matters and striving for cooperation in public matters can success be achieved. Let's take "cholera" as an example. Everyone knows that this disease is a very serious infectious disease in summer, spreading very quickly and harming countless people every year. To avoid this disease, one must be vaccinated, but vaccination requires everyone to truly implement it to be effective. Because a few people who are not vaccinated are still susceptible to cholera, and then the disease spreads from a few people, causing widespread harm and suffering to everyone. This is just one example, but it already proves that individual actions in public health work often have a great impact on public health. Therefore, everyone should work together and implement it together in order to avoid all harms and achieve the goal of sharing happiness, longevity, and well-being. The hygiene campaign held in our city is now the fifth time, and the sole purpose is to awaken citizens who do not recognize the importance of hygiene, warn those who undermine public health, and make them realize their mistakes. We also want to ask citizens who already know the importance of public health to rise up quickly and encourage each other to achieve the goal of longevity and health as soon as possible. Therefore, in order to seek the health of individuals and the public, to avoid the pain of disease, to avoid the tragedy of infectious diseases, to increase the status of the country, to seek the health of our entire nation, and to save humanity from the suffering of disease and premature death, we should all pay close attention to hygiene, starting with implementing it ourselves and maintaining public health. We should break the erroneous idea that "if others do not care about public health, it will not be very effective for me to implement it alone." Everyone should make up their minds to be an initiator who loves public health and a practitioner who protects public health. Because a society is based on individuals, if you say that you will wait for others to do it first, then what if everyone says the same? How can we find an initiator and a practitioner? Therefore, everyone should regard taking care of public health as their own responsibility and not stand idly by. Now, I will propose some key points that should be noted for the benefit of public health and personal hygiene and write them down below. I hope everyone will pay close attention, remember them firmly, and implement them permanently: (1) Do not spit anywhere; (2) Do not litter waste anywhere; (3) Do not dump garbage indiscriminately; (4) Do not urinate anywhere; (5) Do not obstruct the cleanliness of streets and public places, and supervise and correct each other; (6) Cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing; (7) Listen to the guidance of health and political agencies and implement various disease prevention methods; (8) Pay attention to personal hygiene and keep utensils and houses clean; (9) Brush your teeth every day, cut your nails regularly, and get eight hours of sleep every day; (10) Do not use public towels and teacups; (11) Pay attention to exercise, breathe fresh air, and get plenty of sunlight; (12) Do not eat raw water and cut-up fruits sold in retail; (13) Strive to eliminate mosquitoes and flies and eradicate their source; (14) Seek medical treatment promptly when sick, do not believe in evil magic, and do not take medicine blindly; (15) The sanitary common sense that self has learned should lead the family and cohabitation as usual.</p>
<p>Jiu Fu Company on Baike Road has often given away sanitary products such as fly swatters or Sheng Dan pills for previous hygiene campaigns. This time, since the fly swatters have already been given away, they are giving away 2,000 packages of Sheng Dan sample pills. This pill was originally a seasonal essential medicine, and it has been highly praised since it was launched years ago. After receiving it, the Health Bureau has sent a letter of thanks.</p>
<h3>Years of Tumultuous</h3>
<p>Settlement of the Jiyu Dispute</p>
<p>Zhao Tieqiao Sends Personnel to Take Over</p>
<p>Li Guojie Relinquishes His Position</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the situation, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's operations in various areas have been sluggish, and the economic aspect has inevitably been affected. Zhao Tieqiao, the general manager of the company, has great determination for the company's affairs, advocating taking the opportunity to rectify and actively expand, planning to divide it into three stages. The first step of the rectification procedure has been completed, and the second step will continue to be implemented. Expansion must first have a huge amount of economic resources before it can be implemented step by step, otherwise even a clever woman cannot cook without rice. Last year, Zhao then submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to bring the Jiyu Company under the management of the company, intending to use the proceeds to develop the shipping industry. However, Li Guojie, the director of the company and manager of the Jiyu Company, refused to allow personnel sent by Zhao to take over. Initially, the two sides engaged in a telegram war, and then General Manager Zhao issued an order to dismiss Li from his post. Li refused to hand over and filed a lawsuit, and Li also filed a counterclaim. The dispute has been in court for a long time, and the Jiyu turmoil that has accumulated over the years has recently taken a sharp turn, from legal issues to administrative sanctions. Zhao Tieqiao actually won the victory, and Li Weihou was unable to resist and handed over all of his assets. Now Zhao has sent personnel to take over, and from now on, Zhao's grand expansion plan can be implemented one by one with the use of this huge amount of assets. This is a major turning point in our Chinese shipping industry. The situation of Zhao's takeover of the Jiyu Company is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Civil Service Office issued an order to hand over the matter. For several months, the Zhao-Li dispute has reached its extreme, with both sides refusing to yield. At the beginning of this month, the Civil Service Office of the National Government, based on Zhao Tieqiao's request, ordered Zhang Qun, the mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality, to instruct Li Guojie, the director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and manager of Jiyu, to hand over the Jiyu real estate to the new manager by a certain date. If he delays again, he will be dealt with according to the law. After the municipal government forwarded this order to Jiyu, on the 5th of this month, Li Guojie agreed to hand over all the property documents under his management as requested, and Zhao Tieqiao immediately sent personnel to take over.</p>
<p>Fu Ju Cun arrived at his post. Fu Ju Cun, the new manager of Jiyu, was originally appointed by Zhao last year, but was unable to take office due to Li's refusal to hand over. On the 5th of this month, Li agreed to hand over his position at Jiyu, and Fu arrived at the company to take inventory of the various real estate documents in the local and foreign areas and officially took over the matter. As of today, all have been taken over. After relinquishing his duties, Li Weihou left the company and has not been to the company since.</p>
<p>New measures in the plan. The organization of the company has always been divided into three departments under the general manager: general affairs, engineering affairs, and accounting, each with a director and clerk responsible for their duties. Now, Fu Ju Cun has made some changes in the organization and has drafted a new system, which has been submitted to Zhao Tieqiao for approval and will be announced soon. The most important thing at present is to change the format of the rent tickets for tenants in each property. In the past, those who collected rent directly from Jiyu now add the name of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's treasury to jointly collect the money. The signature of Zhong Shuzu, the director of the treasury, has been added to the rent receipts to show that Jiyu is a property of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company.</p>
<p>Expansion of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. With the Jiyu Company taken over, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can now circulate and activate economically, which is related to the expansion plan. Recently, the staff in the company have also been very excited. It is heard that the company's entire expansion is to add more than 60,000 tons of ships and build new Western-style buildings. At present, the first step of expansion, which is considered to be the most important and urgent, is the development of business in the Yangtze River. According to the results of the investigation, the company has first increased the number of large iron barges and tugboats in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, such as Yichang, Xiangtan, and Changsha, as the first step in competing for shipping in the upper reaches. It is heard that more than 20 ships will be built first.</p>

The next morning, he was escorted to the British Police Court and charged with spreading inflammatory text. The defendant claimed that two other people gave him the flyers to distribute and that he was unaware of the dangerous nature of the text. This morning (the 14th), the British Court resumed the trial. A questioning official ruled that the evidence presented was insufficient and ordered the defendant to provide a peace bond of 500 yuan for his release.</p>

<h3>Public Concession Tram Workers' Strike to Change to Negotiations Today</h3>
<p>Police and Company Representatives to Negotiate Together</p>
<p>Disturbances Occurred on Hard Road Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The public concession tram workers originally scheduled negotiations at the Central Hotel yesterday. At around 11:00 AM, the police sent three detectives to the hotel to prevent the meeting from taking place. The workers then went to the Andong Hotel to open a room. The strike committee immediately notified all workers to gather at the hotel. More than 600 people arrived. Fearing trouble, the detectives told the workers that the workers' proposed conditions had to be translated into English and negotiated with the company, so they asked the workers to wait until tomorrow (today) at 10:00 AM at the Andong Hotel for the police and company representatives to come to negotiate. Therefore, the strike committee yesterday notified all workers to go to Andong at 10:00 AM today to await negotiations and not to resume work privately before the resolution. Yesterday morning, a small number of ticket sellers at the old factory drove the Route 2 tram. The workers heard the news and gathered in the Hard Road area in an instant, about three or four hundred people. They saw the Route 2 tram coming and went forward to dissuade the drivers from driving. The drivers did not listen, and the crowd immediately pulled down the car and clashed with the drivers. A large team of patrolmen rushed to the scene, and the crowd had already dispersed. The detectives searched along the road and arrested eight people. More than 300 unemployed tram workers held a mass meeting yesterday and elected several representatives to participate in the work of the strike committee and unanimously resolved to (1) strive for the minimum conditions with the employed workers; (2) insist on "restoring the jobs of unemployed workers and not firing workers" with the employed workers; (3) (omitted); (4) organize a picket team, a donation team, and a propaganda team. The Da Wan Bao reported that according to people in the tram company, all trams in the public concession should be able to resume operations before Saturday. This morning (the 14th), in addition to 16 Route 2 trams running between Jing'an Temple and Waiyang Jingqiao, five more trams were running between Tilanjian and Waiyang Jingqiao at around 10:00 AM. No accidents occurred on either route. Company personnel expect that another route can be added tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Yesterday</h3>
<p>Public Buses Resume Operations</p>
<p>The public bus drivers of the local public concession have been on strike since April 19, and three and a half weeks have passed. With the police personnel mediating, the two sides reached an agreement on the afternoon of the 13th, and the workers' demands were largely accepted. Yesterday morning (the 14th) at 7:15 AM, 200 drivers arrived at the company to resume work. Half an hour later, all vehicles were operating as usual. It is heard that the drivers first held a meeting in the open space of Jiaozhou Road before resuming work to celebrate their victory and sent representatives to express their gratitude to the police personnel.</p>
<h3>Sale of China-Foreign Telephone Company</h3>
<p>Contents of the Advisory Committee Report</p>
<p>Favoring the ITT Bid</p>
<p>The British-owned Shanghai China-Foreign Telephone Company Limited has announced that it has submitted the report of the Advisory Committee and the bids of three foreign companies to the Shanghai Municipal Council and published them in a booklet and distributed them to the shareholders. The contents of the Advisory Committee report are listed below: The committee has reviewed the bids of the three companies and consulted with representatives of Eriksson Telephone Company, Caser, International Telephone and Telegraph Company, Kirjelmer, and Telegraph and Telephone Trust Company, Swivel Jains. When the committee makes a decision, (1) it must take into account the interests of the shareholders; (2) it must take into account the interests of the users. Therefore, it must first know which company's bid can improve services and completely install automatic telephones in the shortest possible time and ensure satisfaction. After careful consideration, the committee recommends accepting the bid of International Tele</p>

<p>May 15, 19th Year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>phone and Telegraph Company. The price it is willing to pay to the shareholders is 75 taels per share, which is quite fair, and it has the following advantages in terms of rectifying services and re-equipping automatic telephones: (1) It has a thorough understanding of the current telephone system and its shortcomings and is very clear about the situation in this port because its China Electric Equipment Co., Ltd., which is divided into China, has replaced the external lines for the telephone company in the past few months and has more than 200 skilled workers engaged in the work. (2) Because it can deliver goods quickly, it is more convenient to repair and re-equip a complete set of automatic telephones. Within eleven months, 17,000 lines can be re-equipped, 22,000 lines within twelve months, 24,000 lines within fourteen months, 30,000 lines within eighteen months, and 43,000 lines within twenty-four months. (3) The staff of China-Foreign Telephone Company are familiar with the operation of rotary automatic telephones, so although the interest on its capital expenditure is slightly higher than that of other companies, the benefits are very large because the cost increase by users is minimal. Eriksson Telephone Company is willing to pay a price of 100 taels per share, which is 25 taels more than International Telephone and Telegraph Company. A weekly interest of 9% requires an annual interest of 900,000 taels. The reason why it is willing to pay a high price is that Eriksson's automatic electricity can be installed and operated at a relatively low cost. The committee is not satisfied with this, and Eriksson Company also plans to change to the Strang-style automatic telephone, so it has the bid of Telegraph and Telephone Trust Company, so it is not adopted. The price offered by Telegraph and Telephone Trust Company is 80 taels per share, but there are two main objections to it: (1) It is a hybrid system. (2) If the current rotary automatic telephone is discarded and the 9,000 lines of orders that are already in production are canceled and completely re-equipped with Strang-style, the capital expenditure will inevitably be too large. The hybrid system is strongly opposed by Mr. Anson because the result will inevitably lead to poor service and too much expenditure will be lost. Regarding the financial aspect, the interest to be taken by the three companies for the invested capital is different. Eriksson plans to take 9%, International Telephone and Telegraph Company plans to take 1.05 points, and Telegraph and Telephone Trust Company plans to take at least 6% and at most 1 point. If it gets 1 point, 2 points will be taken for public accumulation and included in the repair price fund. The undersigned are Bagir Henk Men Spielberg.</p>
<h3>Affordable Rice Focuses on Quality</h3>
<p>Distribution Points to be Established in Zhabei and Xujiahui</p>
<p>Eight affordable rice distribution points set up by the Municipal Rice Price Committee started selling on the 11th of this month, as reported in this newspaper. It is learned that each distribution point is located in a densely populated area of civilians, and the daily sales of rice are very active. It is faintly heard that the rice sold a few days ago contained a small amount of sand and gravel. After learning of this, the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel a few days ago to order the purchasing department to replace the inferior rice containing a small amount of sand with high-quality rice and to recover all the inferior rice. On the one hand, it plans to add distribution points in the Xujiahui New West District and Baoshan Road in Zhabei in order to popularize it.</p>

<h3>Important News from the Aviation World</h3>
<p>The Yi Li Damaged in a Collision: The Yi Li steamer of the Yi Li Company was previously damaged in Shanghai when it was struck by the Chongqing steamer of the Taikoo Yangtze River Company in the Huangpu River. It was taken out of service for repairs, resulting in losses of over ten thousand taels of silver. Before resuming service after the repairs, the ship arrived in Wenzhou the other day and was berthed at the pier unloading cargo when the Guangli steamer of the China Merchants Bureau arrived and collided heavily with the Yi Li's outer hull in the rear cabin while docking. The iron plate of the Yi Li's hull, about three or four feet square, was breached by the Guangli's impact, but fortunately, it did not pierce through, though it was damaged. Yesterday, the Yi Li arrived in Shanghai to undergo repairs and sent a letter to the China Merchants Bureau claiming the repair costs for the collision damage.</p>
<p>Japanese Company Organizes a Tour: The new fast steamer Kinai Maru, built by Osaka Kisen Kaisha, is scheduled to launch its maiden voyage on July 25th. The ship's route includes ports in both northern and southern China. Therefore, before the launch, the company initiated the organization of a North-South China tour group. The route has been determined to be from Japan to Beiping (Beijing) via Dalian, then to Qingdao, then to Shanghai, followed by Fuzhou in Fujian, then to Kaohsiung and Keelung in Taiwan, a round trip of eighteen days. The price for a first-class cabin is set at 145 yuan. Yesterday, the head office instructed the Shanghai branch to determine one-way fares for tourists to Fujian and Taiwan and to solicit passengers.</p>
<p>Barge Foreman's Bereavement Allowance: On the 25th of last month, three wheat barges belonging to the Fuxin Factory were sunk in the Huangpu River by the Haiyan steamer, and one boatman, Zeng Ji, drowned. Subsequently, this newspaper reported that the Fuxin Factory sent a letter to the China Merchants Bureau requesting compensation. After investigation by officials from the Bureau, it was determined that the three barges had strayed into the wrong waterway, and the Haiyan steamer was not at fault. The Bureau decided not to bear any compensation responsibility. However, out of consideration for the hardships of the barge workers, the China Merchants Bureau provided a bereavement allowance of fifty yuan for the drowned boatman. The Bureau has already replied to the Fuxin Factory to this effect for their information.</p>
<h3>British Merchant Marine School Agrees to Accept Chinese Students</h3>

<h3>No More Buying and Selling Based on Old Deeds After Measurement and Certification of Land</h3>
<p>The Land Bureau has completed the measurement and issued land title certificates for land lots in the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and ninth districts of the 25th ward in the South Shanghai area. Recently, many property owners have enthusiastically brought their old deeds to the bureau to exchange them for land title certificates. Because a few property owners are still taking a wait-and-see attitude, the bureau has ordered the Shanghai South District Real Estate Deed Distribution Office not to allow any further buying and selling of land in the above-mentioned areas based on old deeds in order to supervise the prompt exchange of certificates, to ensure proper regulation, and to facilitate the conclusion of the process.</p>
<h3>Appeal to Repair the Tang Pagodas in Western Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the Tang Dynasty Bao Xing Twin Pagodas in Pinghu County, Zhejiang, after repeated appeals by the local Pinghu gentry in Shanghai and officials in Beijing, a consensus is gradually being reached, and the villagers are gradually realizing their mistakes and no longer raising objections. However, a man named Qi Qixiang in the county suddenly submitted a petition to the county party headquarters requesting that it be forwarded to the provincial authorities for demolition, and there are rumors that he intends to demolish the pagodas before receiving provincial orders. As a result, the debate has intensified again. The group of advocates questioned the county magistrate, Fang Li, asking if he would order the demolition and fabricate lies to report, in which case the county magistrate would bear full responsibility for the case. Ren Junji, who is currently in Shanghai, sent a special letter to the provincial authorities yesterday requesting that the demolition be stopped. Furthermore, the Pinghu fellow-villagers association in Shanghai sent a letter to County Magistrate Fang Li, stating: "Regarding the case of the Tang Pagodas in the North Temple, we have sent letters and telegrams requesting that Your Excellency stop the demolition. We hope you have already received them. During this period of political tutelage, we must strive for development. Therefore, ancient buildings should be preserved in accordance with the orders of the Ministry of the Interior so that historical sites are not lost and culture advances. This applies not only to our county. Now that the villagers are considering demolishing the twin pagodas without any reason, even if they have other motives, the artifacts of over a thousand years will be destroyed in a single day, which Your Excellency will not allow. Furthermore, the elders in our hometown and the fellow-villagers in Beijing have sent letters and telegrams appealing for repairs, which are well-known. Therefore, we are sending another telegram requesting that Your Excellency comply with the situation and submit the letters and telegrams regarding the repairs to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval and implementation in order to respect public opinion and demonstrate fairness." Sincerely, the Standing Committee of the Pinghu Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai, Gu Yanxing, Cheng Zengfeng, Cui Baoqi, and Han Yin.</p>

<h3>Shantou National Goods Association</h3>
<p>Condemns the Harmful Effects of Chemical Fertilizers</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation received a letter from Ma Zonghan, chairman of the Shantou China National Goods Maintenance Association, stating: "Foreign chemical fertilizers are made from nitric acid and inferior raw materials and are highly toxic, depleting the essential elements of the soil. When used in farmland, the rice stalks may grow vigorously, but the grains are not firm. When used in gardens, the vegetables and fruits are bound to contain toxins and taste salty and bitter. Vegetables and fruits transported overseas rot during transit. When used on sugarcane, the juice is less, the color is dark, and the taste is salty. Initially, because of its strong properties, it exhausts the soil's elements at once, which is temporarily considered beneficial, but soon fertile soil becomes stony land. Those who promote and advertise it only seek personal gain, and farmers fall for their tricks, which is like drinking poison to quench thirst. Eventually, the land becomes barren, and the lack of grain leads to national demise and racial extinction, a disaster worse than opium. It is estimated that over 350,000 bags of chemical fertilizer are imported into Shantou annually. The soybean cakes from Yingkou, Dalian, and Andong, which used to sell over 8 million pieces annually, have recently decreased to over 2 million pieces. Sales of domestic products are sharply decreasing, and the invasion of foreign goods is intensifying. Money is flowing out of the country, and the land is being devastated. If no measures are taken to prohibit it, it is unknown how deep the disaster will be. Japan, which has conducted the most research on planting, still uses 40 million pieces of our country's soybean cakes annually and does not use chemical fertilizer. Our country's production is lagging behind, so how can we abandon domestic goods and use harmful foreign goods? Our association convened a city-wide congress of industry and commerce, and Cai Shifan, a representative of the city chamber of commerce, explained the harm of chemical fertilizer. He requested that the government issue a strict prohibition and advise merchants not to promote it and farmers not to buy it, and to continue using domestic soybean cakes to cultivate the national foundation. The proposal was unanimously passed, and everyone agreed that the harm of chemical fertilizer is not limited to one town or county. We propose that party branches, chambers of commerce, and national goods organizations at home and abroad provide assistance and request the National Government to strictly prohibit its import and advise merchants not to sell and farmers not to buy it, and to continue using domestic soybean cakes to cultivate the national foundation. Please investigate and promptly promote this."</p>

<h3>Progress of the Cycling Competition</h3>
<p>The Weile Garden Cycling Competition is an outdoor recreation venue dedicated to promoting new sports and increasing the public's enjoyment of legitimate entertainment. It is located next to the Riding School on Haig Road in West Shanghai, covering an area of twenty acres with fresh air. Construction has been underway for two weeks, and the track and stands are expected to be completed on schedule. In addition to bicycle and motorcycle races, there will also be a "machine-paced bicycle" race. This type of vehicle has not been seen in Shanghai before. Its form is similar to a motorcycle, and its power is very strong. When it moves, it emits a gust of air behind the vehicle, which can pull the bicycle behind it and increase its speed. It is the most exciting and stimulating. When the machine wheels are clattering and circling, few of the spectators in the seats do not have beaming faces and are absorbed in the excitement. For bicycle races using machine-paced vehicles as guides, the bicycles used are of the "Styr Oil" type, with a small front wheel and a large rear wheel, and the seat is close to the front wheel to reduce wind resistance. Machine-paced bicycle races used to be dangerous, so in recent years, the International Cycling Association has specified a regulation that a steel pipe be installed behind the vehicle for protection. After adopting this method, racers in various countries can consistently achieve a speed of 100 kilometers per hour. The famous French Styr Oil racer, Mr. Conard, even set a new record of 101 kilometers per hour. Because there is no longer any concern about explosions after the installation of steel pipes, the rider can concentrate on maximizing their speed. The Weile Garden Training Center has been training for three months, and there are over 30 trainees. They have hired Mr. Bengsheng, a Swedish expert, who trains them daily with remarkable results. In addition, there will be good players from various countries participating in the training and competition. The Japanese are known for their cycling skills, so there will be a large number of Japanese competitors in the future. Recently, Mr. Li Silian has also organized several amateur cycling teams, all of whom are students from various schools. He has asked Mr. Bengsheng to provide free training in order to develop the abilities of amateur athletes and achieve good results.</p>
<h3>Woman Requests Division of Deceased Husband's Estate</h3>
<p>The Plaintiff's Identity</p>
<p>The Son's Origins</p>
<p>The Crux of this Case</p>
<p>The woman, Ling Chen, has retained attorney Zhu Shuzhen to request the court to allocate the estate of her deceased husband, Ling Zhengxiang, stating that after her husband's death, his estate was sold, and she is now requesting a legal division of the assets. Ling Zhengxiang passed away due to illness in May of last year, leaving behind three daughters and one son, Ling Yi, from the defendant, Ling Xu. The son, named Yongyuan, is the plaintiff's son born in 1926. The plaintiff and the defendant have lived together since 1926 and have been on good terms until now. After her husband's death, the defendant, at the urging of her married sister-in-law, Xie Ling, sold her husband's residence outside Dadongmen, on Lao Xin Street, for over 10,000 taels of silver, receiving 800 taels so far. She has paid off debts, and the remaining amount is kept with the buyer. Considering the various needs of raising Yongyuan, it should be divided into six shares (one share each for the plaintiff, the defendant, the three daughters, and the son). Yesterday, Judge Zhao Zhenhai specially opened the tenth courtroom to hear the case. The plaintiff, Ling Chen, testified that she is 34 years old, from Suzhou, and currently resides with her mother's family at No. 10, Zhenhe Lane, East Zilaihuo Street, in the French Concession. She also testified about the previous events. The defendant, Ling Xu, testified that she is 36 years old. She said that when the plaintiff came to her home, her husband said it was just for a few days. (Question) Do you know if she was your husband's mistress? (Answer) I didn't know. (Question) When did you find out that Ling Chen was your husband's mistress? (Answer) It was not until September or October of that year that I found out. (Question) After you found out, did Chen often stay at your home? (Answer) She came and went, it was not certain. (Question) Did your husband and Chen sleep in the same place or in two different places? (Answer) They were in the same room, but there were two beds. I had a separate bedroom, so I don't know exactly how it was. (Question) Who sold the residence? (Answer) A buyer named Xu. The price was 10,000 taels. 8,000 taels were used to pay off debts, and my husband had borrowed over 700 yuan from my brother, which was also repaid. Only over 2,000 yuan remained. The Judge then asked the plaintiff, Ling Chen, what was her relationship with Ling Zhengxiang? (Answer) His wife, we didn't distinguish between big and small. (Question) When did you move in? (Answer) I moved in on July 14, 1925, and lived together. (Question) Was there a matchmaker? (Answer) No, I moved in because I was pregnant. (Question) Did you have a wedding feast when you moved in? (Answer) No. My husband said he would have a feast when the baby was born. My baby was born on May 16, 1925. (Question) When did you and Ling Zhengxiang start your relationship? (Answer) In 1923. At that time, I lived in Yongxing Lane, 6th Avenue. (Question) How could there be no matchmaker? (Answer) The son of my mother's adopted brother, surnamed Jin, was friends with Ling and came to my house. Because Xu did not allow it, I postponed moving in. The court ordered the witness, Gu Hongxiang, to testify. He stated: "I am Ling Zhengxiang's maternal uncle. The defendant, Ling Xu, is indeed Ling Zhengxiang's first wife. I was the matchmaker. I don't know who Ling Chen is. My brother-in-law left an estate of over 50,000 taels of silver, which has now been used up. It is deplorable. The five-year-old son claimed by the plaintiff is not her own. He was bought from someone in Hangzhou for 30 yuan to be a wet nurse." (Question) What was the price of the house? (Answer) I don't know, because they didn't listen to me, so I didn't ask about anything. Xie Ling also testified, stating: "Ling Xu is my sister-in-law. I don't know Chen. (Question) When did Ling Chen come to your brother's house? (Answer) According to my sister-in-law Xu, that woman came often. (Question) When was the child born? (Answer) He was bought for 30 yuan." The Judge then questioned the plaintiff, Ling Chen, "Is your son adopted?" (Answer) "No, he is definitely my own." At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer submitted two photos of the child and Ling Zhengxiang to the court for inspection. The Judge then attempted to mediate, ordering the defendant to deposit 1,000 yuan in a bank for interest, to be used for the child's support. The defendant refused to reconcile, stating that the child was not her husband's. The Judge then adjourned the court for further hearings.</p>

<h3>University Student</h3>
<p>Suddenly Kidnapped</p>
<p>A Terrible Calamity Befalls a Private Study Session</p>
<p>Kidnappers Go Straight Upstairs to Seize the Victim</p>
<p>A Note is Left Downstairs to Intimidate</p>
<p>An Exorbitant Ransom of 150,000 Taels of Gold is Demanded</p>
<p>The Victim's Mother Had Just Returned to Her Hometown</p>
<p>Sun Huaiyi, courtesy name Jingtao, from Huai'an, is 21 years old. Last autumn, he came to Shanghai from his hometown to study political science at Xinmin University on Connaught Road. He resided at the residence of Attorney Zhang at No. 22 Wuding Road. At around 8:30 PM the night before last, Sun was alone in his bedroom studying when three kidnappers went straight upstairs and abducted him. Beforehand, while the guests were talking in Attorney Zhang's office downstairs, before the kidnappers went upstairs, they entered the room and placed a note on the round table, shouting "Don't move! Don't move!" The guests, seeing that the intruders were armed, were stunned and did not dare to make a sound. The kidnappers then did as they pleased and abducted Sun Huaiyi from his bedroom. Afterward, the Gordon Road Police Station was notified to investigate, but there was no progress as of yesterday. According to Sun's friends, his family is not wealthy, and he lost his father early in life and has no one to rely on except his mother. Their abduction of him may be due to a misunderstanding. However, judging from the note they left, it seems that this was planned for more than just a day. The gist of the note was that so and so had been taken away for the purpose of raising funds and could be redeemed for 150,000 taels of gold. Furthermore, the matter must not be publicized. His recent photo, Sun Huaiyi, can be seen here.</p>
<p>The tone and wording were clearly from a person of education, which is also rather incomprehensible. Before entering Xinmin University, Sun Huaiyi studied at the Nanjing No. 53 Public School. He came to Shanghai last August to study political science at Xinmin and has now advanced to the fourth grade and will graduate this summer. His mother, Ms. Xu, also moved to Shanghai this year on February 8 of the lunar calendar and lived with Sun at No. 22 Wuding Road to take care of him. Last Sunday, Ms. Xu took a servant and returned to her hometown, leaving only Sun Huaiyi alone in Shanghai, as he was an adult and she did not expect anything to happen to him. When Sun was kidnapped, he was in his private room and was not wearing formal attire. He was only wearing a shirt on his upper body and Western-style trousers on his lower body, a rather embarrassing situation.</p>
<h3>A 108-Year-Old Man</h3>
<p>A Fine Tale of a Muslim</p>
<p>A 108-year-old man recently arrived from the north at the Foreign Muslim Mosque at No. 28 Zhejiang Road, 6th Avenue in Shanghai. He has a child-like complexion with white hair and beard that is several inches long and walks with a light gait. His name is Li Fangxiao, courtesy name Shangyi, from Xiangcheng County, Henan. He is 108 years old. This elder is vigorous in spirit and speaks with great eloquence. Every time he speaks of his experiences, he is very engaging. The following is a brief summary: The elder has been a Muslim for generations and learned Arabic in his youth. He was born in the Yin hour of the eighth day of the eighth month of the third year of the Daoguang Emperor of the Qing Dynasty (1823). At the age of seven, he followed Shi Zhixuan Hengxiu, a senior Ahong (a respected and senior religious leader in Islam), from Xiangcheng County, Henan, to study Arabic. When he was a young man, he followed Ma Juncai, Yang Shizhen, Liu Qinglian, Ma Shangde, and other famous Ahongs. In the 24th year of Daoguang (1844), he received the Rite of Passage in Jiyuan, Henan (equivalent to baptism in Christianity or ordination in Buddhism) at the invitation of Miao Chang and Li Cai of Xunbao County, and served as a religious leader there for six years (28th year of Daoguang). He was then hired by Governor Huang Yumin to specialize in religious affairs. In the fifth year of Xianfeng (1855), he returned to Dengfeng, Henan, and was in charge of the main temple. In the first year of Tongzhi (1862), he served at the Shiyichengkou Temple. In the second year of Guangxu (1876), he returned to his old post in Baofeng. In the eighth year, he traveled to Badazhou in Guangxi, where he met Brigadier General Zhang Shuxia. In the ninth year, he followed Zhang to Jiaozhi. In the eleventh year, he returned to Guangxi and took charge of religious affairs in Nanning. In the same year, he went to Baiyi to set up an altar for 13 and a half years. Then, he followed General Cai Jinzhang in the Guangxi provincial capital, serving as a religious leader in the Guang Sheng Army Camp. In the 15th year, he went to Taiwan to serve as a religious leader in Commander Ma Junting's camp. Later, Taiwan fell. In the 21st year, he returned to Zhengzhou and served as a long-term religious leader in Shilipu. In the 22nd year, he went to Baotou to serve as the director of classical studies. In the 24th year, he went to Zhujiachengzi, which belonged to Kuanchengzi in the three eastern provinces, to be a religious leader. He soon abandoned his religious career and engaged in business, traveling to the borders. In the fourth year of the Republic (1915), he returned to Zhujiachengzi to serve as a religious leader for 11 years. In the 15th year, he resigned and returned to medicine in Zhangjiawa. In the 18th year, he went to Heilongjiang and transferred to Taonan for a short stay of more than three months. He then went to Liaoyang for another three months and arrived in Yingkou to spend the year. At the end of last month, he came to Shanghai for a short stay and will go to Mecca for a pilgrimage to complete his remaining years. The elder has two sons. The elder son is 75 years old and named Yongcheng, and he has two granddaughters. They currently live in Baofeng County, Henan. The younger son is also 62 years old and named Chengzhi, and he has two grandsons and granddaughters. They live separately in various parts of Heilongjiang. Both sons are in the leather business. His wife passed away 55 years ago, when the elder was only 53 years old. In the fifth month of that year, he remarried, and by the end of the year, he was widowed again. Since then, he has not remarried. His voice is loud and full of energy. If you listened to him talking from another room, you would hardly be able to tell that he is an elderly man.</p>
<h3>Pursuing a Matchmaker, Audaciously Blaring a Police Whistle and Yelling "Thief!"</h3>
<p>Plainclothes Detective Fires a Shot</p>
<p>A Man, Identified as Someone "A," Struck in a Vital Area</p>
<p>Releasing "White Doves" is Certainly Illegal</p>
<p>Audaciously Yelling "Thief!" Should Also Incur Responsibility</p>
<p>Yesterday at 5:30 PM, at the Hengfeng Tobacco and Paper Shop entrance on South Chengdu Road and Xin Dagou Road, Anhui native Fu Chunsheng was chasing a man, identified only as someone "A." In his desperation, he went so far as to frantically blow a police whistle and yell "Thief!" At that moment, a plainclothes detective from the Xinzha Police Station happened to be passing by. Seeing Fu Chunsheng yelling "Catch the thief!" and observing the person running away ahead, he determined that the fleeing man was certainly not a good sort. He immediately aimed at the man, "A," and fired a shot, hitting him in a vital area. Even after being wounded, "A" still tried to escape but was immediately caught by the detective. Fu Chunsheng, who had yelled "Thief!," was also taken into the police station. Later, seeing that "A" was seriously wounded, he was immediately transported by vehicle to a hospital for treatment. According to a reporter's investigation, the so-called "A" was not actually a thief. Last year, Fu Chunsheng's younger brother, Fu Chunliu, married a woman for whom "A" had acted as a matchmaker, receiving 140 silver dollars for his services. However, "A" and Fu were merely nodding acquaintances, so he did not know his last name. Later, less than two months after the marriage, his brother's wife vanished without a trace. The Fu brothers considered the matter and suspected that they had been victims of "releasing white doves," a common scam prevalent in Shanghai. They wanted to investigate, but the woman had flown away like a wild goose, impossible to find. Yesterday at 5:00 PM, Fu Chunsheng happened to be heading north on South Chengdu Road when he saw someone walking ahead wearing a whitish-gray serge suit, resembling the person who had acted as a matchmaker for his brother the previous year. Because he didn't know the man's name, he immediately chased him north, intending to discover his identity. Seeing someone chasing him from behind, "A" began to run. Fu, in his desperation, shouted "Thief!" resulting in his being shot in a vital area by the plainclothes detective. It is reported that his injuries are very serious.</p>
<h3>French Tram Company Raises Fares</h3>
<p>Effective Today</p>
<p>The French Tram Company in the French Concession has revised its tram fares. This has been submitted and approved by the French Municipal Council and is scheduled to be implemented on the 15th of this month. The fare for the section from the Sixteen Piles to the Great World Amusement Park station will remain the same as before, without any increase. The price for the third-class tickets at four cents (i.e. four copper coins) will also not be raised. However, all other first-class and third-class tickets, regardless of the distance traveled, will each be increased by two cents. The company posted the revised fare schedule on all trams yesterday, to be implemented starting today.</p>
<h3>Fratricide Case</h3>
<p>Sun Shibao Still Attempts to Deny the Crime</p>
<p>The Photographs Clearly Identify Him</p>
<p>Two Witnesses Give Identical Accounts</p>
<p>Bloodstains on the Knife Deserve Investigation</p>
<p>Sun Shilin, a native of Hefei, was killed by his younger brother, Sun Shibao, at dawn on February 12th, at his home at No. 1753 Yinghua Lane, Roberts Road, in western Shanghai. Previously, detectives Kong Qingping, Ma Mouxiang, Yao Changmin, etc., from the Putuo Road Police Station, learned that Shibao had returned home. When they went to arrest him, his mother, Sun Xia, and his wife, Sun Zhu, came out to stop them, and even bit Detective Yao's hand, resulting in their being arrested and sent to the Special District Local Court for interrogation. Details of these events were previously reported. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi convened a court session to continue the hearing. According to the police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, the defendant, Sun Shibao, still denies that his name is Sun Shibao, claiming to be Xia Shaozeng. Therefore, the preliminary issue in this case is that point. The police station now has a photograph taken of the staff and workers of the Huafa Company (a French company), in which the defendant is also present. Two carpenters from the company have been invited to testify that the defendant is indeed Sun Shibao, beyond any doubt. The photograph was then presented as evidence. Next, two carpenters from the Huafa Company, Zhao and Zou, successively gave their testimony, stating that they and the first defendant were not only from the same hometown, but also worked together, and they knew for certain that his name was Sun Shibao. They pointed out that the second person in the first row of the photograph was the defendant. Judge Wu, after carefully examining the photograph, found the truth undeniable. He sternly questioned him, but the defendant continued to insist that his name was Xia Shaozeng, that he had come to Shanghai from his hometown not long ago, and that he had never met the two witnesses, Zhao and Zou, requesting that his grievance be redressed. Judge Wu then questioned Sun Xia about whose property the murder axe was. She admitted that it was hers, used for chopping wood. She was then asked why there were bloodstains on it, if it was used for chopping firewood. She replied that her son, Shilin, was killed in bed at the time, and the bedding was stained with blood, so the blood on the axe must have been transferred. Sun Zhu claimed ignorance on this point. Judge Wu instructed that the defendants be returned to custody separately and adjourned the hearing for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Chen Ying Shi Memorial Hall Scheduled Groundbreaking</h3>
<p>Revolutionary Hero Mr. Chen Ying Shi, who made great contributions to the party and the nation, the Hubei compatriots, in order to admire virtue and repay merit, decided to build the Martyr Chen Gong Ying Shi Memorial Hall within the Hubei Association premises at the corner of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road in the Public Concession (formerly a temple). The groundbreaking ceremony is scheduled to be held on the 18th of this month. In addition to having already requested Special Municipality Mayor Zhang Qun to preside over the ceremony, invitations have been sent respectfully inviting various organizations, groups, and fellow townsmen of Huzhou, etc., to attend the ceremony at the Association. The text of the invitation is as follows: Respected Sir/Madam, This Association, having submitted and received approval from the National Government to build the Martyr Chen Gong Ying Shi Memorial Hall on the Association's premises, has set the groundbreaking ceremony for 2 PM on the 18th of this month. In addition to requesting Special Municipality Mayor Zhang to preside, we hereby extend this invitation, respectfully requesting that you find time to attend the ceremony. We shall be deeply honored.</p>
<h3>Reason the Public Works Department Did Not Purchase the Dahua Hotel</h3>
<p>According to the "North China Daily News," someone recently suggested in the newspapers that the Public Works Department purchase the Dahua Hotel property for public use. The reporter met with Feixindun (likely a transliteration) yesterday, who said that purchasing the Dahua Hotel property and renovating it would cost an estimated two million taels. If this amount were used for other undertakings beneficial to the public, the benefits would far outweigh purchasing the hotel. Therefore, this move is unwise and should not be considered by the Public Works Department. It is noted that when the property was first put up for sale, the Public Works Department had considered it. At that time, the asking price was only 800,000 taels, but it was not suitable for building a hospital or public gathering place, so it was not purchased. As for the demolition of the original Municipal Council Hall, it would not be difficult to find another suitable place for holding annual meetings of Western taxpayers. The Public Works Department already has a drill ground, so there is no need to rush to build a new municipal government building, wasting huge sums of money merely for a grand spectacle.</p>

<h3>Maiden Voyage to America, the Chichibu Maru Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Open to the Public for Viewing Saturday Afternoon</p>
<p>For the purpose of competing in the Pacific shipping industry, the Japanese Mail Steamship Company (Nippon Yusen Kaisha) has newly built three large gasoline-powered ships, the first of which, the Asama Maru, has already begun service last winter. The second, the Chichibu Maru, also departed from Kobe on the first of last month on its maiden voyage to America. It has now returned and will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Although the three ships are sister ships of the same type, the Chichibu Maru is particularly large and its facilities are slightly different. Its length is 583 feet 9 inches, its width is 74 feet, and its depth is 42 feet 6 inches. Its displacement is 22,200 tons and its gross tonnage is 17,300 tons, making it the largest ship currently in Japan. The ship is equipped with two sets of four-wheel turbine engines with 26,400 horsepower, giving it a speed of 21 knots. It can carry 243 first-class passengers, 95 second-class passengers, and 500 steerage passengers. The splendor and comfort of its public rooms are even better than those of the Asama and Tatsuta Maru. It also has a ladies' parlor exclusively for female passengers and a branch of the Sumitomo Bank, a first for ships on the Pacific. In addition, a photographer is stationed permanently on board at fixed prices, taking photos and developing films for passengers. The layout of the first and second-class cabins is roughly similar to that of the Asama Maru. Because this ship is making its first trip to Shanghai, the company has scheduled it to be open to the public for viewing on Saturday afternoon and has already widely distributed invitations. Its departure date for Hong Kong will be Sunday.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Dexingli New Houses Connected to Huajie Tap Water</h3>
<p>When the Public Works Bureau issued licenses for the newly built Dexingli houses near Huaxingli on North Zhejiang Road in Zhabei, it had previously inquired with the Public Utilities Bureau about the existence of Zhabei water pipes and power lines in the area. A stamp stating "Use Huajie Water and Electricity" was affixed for identification. Subsequently, the owner, Fang Xianghe, believing that the Zhabei tap water mains had not yet reached the area, submitted a request through the Public Works Bureau to the Public Utilities Bureau for permission to temporarily connect to the Concession's tap water supply for temporary use. The Bureau found that there was indeed a Huajie 4-inch diameter water pipe on Huaxing Road, which could be connected to the Dexingli new houses simply by passing through the private alley of Huaxingfang. It then sent separate letters to the owner and the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to negotiate the connection. It is now known that the owner has agreed with the company on a method of connecting the pipe from within the north alley of Yuanhengli to the new houses for water supply.</p>
<h3>Personal Gun Licenses Require Shop Guarantees</h3>
<p>Government Agency Personnel May Not Request Accommodations</p>
<p>The Municipal Government's Office for Examining and Licensing Self-Defense Firearms and Cannons previously inquired with the Municipal Government, which then forwarded the inquiry to the Ministry of Military Affairs for verification and handling, regarding whether the provision in Article 4 of the current Provisional Regulations for Examining and Licensing Self-Defense Firearms and Cannons, which states that "applicants for firearm and cannon licenses must first find a reliable shop to provide a guarantee," should be applied to personnel of public offices and agencies, or whether there should be other accommodating measures. It is now known that the Municipal Government received a reply from the Ministry of Military Affairs yesterday, which stated that since Article 4 of the regulations stipulates that individuals applying for self-defense firearm licenses must find a shop to provide a guarantee, this pertains to the law and should not be relaxed for government agency personnel. The Office was then instructed to comply with this.</p>
<h3>Two Cruisers Combating Pirates</h3>
<p>Rescuing Five Hostages</p>
<p>The Haiying cruiser of the Jiangzhe Fisheries Affairs Bureau was patrolling outside the Wusongkou at approximately 7:00 AM yesterday morning when the Jinhunxing ice transport ship, captained by Xie Jinlong, approached the cruiser to report that a pirate ship carrying over thirty pirates had been spotted robbing a fishing boat on the southeast waters of the Great Jici Mountain. Captain Yang Shuheng of the Haiying immediately ordered the ship to track down and capture the pirates. At approximately 9:00 AM, as the ship approached the northwest side of Beitingshan, it spotted a small cargo sailboat on the sea surface. Suspecting its suspicious behavior, the ship immediately ordered it to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, the small boat opened fire on the cruiser. Knowing it was a pirate ship, the cruiser also opened fire. At that moment, another large sailboat not far from the small boat also suddenly opened fire on the cruiser. The cruiser, not paying attention and unprepared, was hit, and the ship's first mate, Chen Er, was shot in the right temple and fell, seriously wounded. The cruiser then opened rapid fire and machine gun fire on the large sailboat, engaging in a fierce battle for a long time. Chasing the pirates to Beitingshan, the pirates, seeing the situation was not good, abandoned the ship and fled to the mountain. The cruiser then turned its rudder and chased the small boat, directly chasing it near the Great Jici Mountain. It captured three pirates on the spot, killing three pirates and capturing Chen Qifa, Jin Li, Jin Liangfu, and three other pirates alive, and rescuing five hostages, including Hu Zaibao, all of whom were crew members. Captain Yang left Hu Qibao on board and ordered the remaining four crew members to sail the ship back to Wusong. The cruiser then turned back and went back to Beitingshan to pursue the pirates who had fled to the mountain. At 1:00 PM, it encountered a sea patrol ship and immediately dispatched sailors to search the mountain together. At 4:00 PM, they found a pirate named Fang Chunsan who had been shot and captured a Mauser rifle discarded by the pirates. According to the pirate, four pirates were killed on the boat and five other pirates fled up the mountain. The injured pirate could not walk and was captured. After searching for a long time, the sailors did not see any traces of the remaining pirates, so they immediately returned to the two ships. The Haiying cruiser towed the large sailboat back to Wusong at 8:00 PM yesterday and reported to the Fisheries Bureau. The injured first mate was sent to the Nanshi Public Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Zhao Shiqi, Indebted for Over 200 Gold, Hangs Himself in Hotel</h3>
<p>Elderly Mother's Tears Flowed Endlessly</p>
<p>Her Condition Was Extremely Tragic</p>
<p>Zhao Shiqi, a native of Ningbo, was just over twenty years old and worked at the Pengpu District Municipal Committee in this city. Recently, due to economic pressure, he was burdened with a debt of over two hundred yuan. His monthly salary was meager and he was unable to repay the debt, so he conceived the idea of suicide. On the night of the 12th, he went alone to the Jiangzhe Hotel at No. 110 Hankou Road and booked a room. The hotel at the time did not notice anything unusual and treated him as a regular guest. Who knew that after closing the door and going to bed, Zhao got up again, untied his belt, and hanged himself. It was not until 9:00 AM the next morning when the tea boy entered the room that he was discovered, but it was too late to save him. The case was reported to the Laozha Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. In addition to the silk cord used for the hanging, there were also two silver dollars and a pair of glasses left behind. The corpse was then taken to the Philander Road Morgue, and it was discovered that the deceased's elderly mother, Zhao Yao, was also in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, she went to the morgue to identify the body. After the Special District Local Court appointed Inspector Xu to come to the morgue for inspection and ruled that the body should be released to the family for burial, the silk cord used for the hanging was kept on file, and the remaining items were given to Zhao Yao. Seeing this relic, the old woman's tears flowed even more endlessly. Her condition was extremely tragic.</p>
<h3>The Trial of the Case of Selling Aphrodisiacs</h3>
<p>Chen Jin Avoids Appearing in Court</p>
<p>Hearing Postponed for Further Inquiry</p>
<p>The Ellis Western Pharmacy specialized in the sale of aphrodisiacs. The Municipal Public Security and Education Bureaus jointly consulted the Special District Local Court to assist in banning this practice. The police station was ordered to send detectives to search and seize various aphrodisiacs, which were confiscated. This has already been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the pharmacy was opened and operated by Chen Jin, who sold these drugs, which are sufficient to harm young people and obstruct public morals. He cannot but bear legal responsibility. Therefore, in addition to confiscating the seized items, the court also issued a summons for Chen Jin to appear in court to be questioned. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen opened the court, but Chen Jin avoided appearing. Zhang Yifan, a staff member of the pharmacy, accompanied by defense lawyer Fan Gang, appeared in court and stated that Chen Jin had gone to Hangzhou on business and requested a postponement. The police station's lawyer stated that the defendant Chen Jin was deliberately avoiding the court and should be taken into custody. Judge Shen then ruled that the case would be adjourned and the defendant would be summoned again for questioning.</p>
<h3>A Sudden Intrusion Into Someone's Home Early in the Morning</h3>
<p>Mu Yu Accused of "Splitting the Scene"</p>
<p>Two People Each Have Their Own Account</p>
<p>A young woman, surnamed Mao, is only twenty-one years old. She married a man, named Jia, who has been dead for three years. It was difficult for the woman to remain a widow in her youth, so she entered into a relationship with Zhang Chunlin and lived together at No. 617 Hailer Road. She worked as a worker in a silk factory and was able to make ends meet. Early in the morning on the 5th of this month, while the woman and Zhang were still dreaming, a man and a woman suddenly broke into their room and started a big argument. Of the seven people, the ones she recognized were Mu Shirong from Liyang and Yu Shunxing from Yangzhou. The rest were unknown and their identities are not known. Afterwards, Ms. Mao filed a complaint with the Harbin Police Station, accusing Mu and Yu of colluding to "split the scene." Yesterday, they were taken into custody by the police station and transferred to the Special District Local Court. Judge Ge Zhitan interrogated them. According to Ms. Mao, she and Zhang Chunlin had only been living together for three weeks. On that morning, the defendants broke into the bedroom and dragged Zhang out of bed without asking questions and began to criticize him. Mu Shirong even held an axe and demanded 20 yuan. Because they had no cash on hand, they opened the suitcase and took several items of clothing, which Yu pawned for 20 yuan and distributed the money, throwing the pawn ticket back to them. Mu Shirong claimed that the woman's deceased husband was his adopted father. At the time of his death, he paid for the funeral expenses. Now that the third anniversary was approaching, he wanted to hold a religious ceremony for him, which would cost 20 yuan. That morning, he went to the woman to get the money and saw her in bed with an unfamiliar man. He was angry and scolded her, but did not "split the scene." Yu Shunxing claimed that he was called by the woman at 1 PM that day because she said she would give Mu 20 yuan as a donation and asked him to be a witness, but the money was never given. He denied all accusations of "splitting the scene" and taking clothes for pawning and hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. However, Sun Yufu and Zhang Du, who lived in the same house as Ms. Mao, both testified that they did see several people barging into Ms. Mao's room and arguing that morning, but they did not know what they were doing. Judge Ge ordered the two defendants to be held pending investigation and further questioning.</p>
<h3>Daughter-in-Law Demands Wife from Mother-in-Law</h3>
<p>Xie Guixiang, Why Are You Here?</p>
<p>Ren Fuchun, a 26-year-old native of Yuyao, worked as a tea server in a hotel in Shanghai. He married Xie Guixiang (a 24-year-old native of Yuyao) and lived together in Shanghai. The couple's relationship was good. Later, Ren lost his job and, because the cost of living in Shanghai was high, he took Guixiang back to his hometown while Ren came to Shanghai alone and stayed at his friend's place at No. 86 Qujiang Li, Sanma Road, to seek work. Guixiang, only five days after her husband left for Shanghai, followed him secretly. On the way, she met Qi Zhangyuan (32 years old, living at No. 160 Huaxingli, Yongxing Road, Zhabei, working at a transport company), who asked Guixiang what she was doing in Shanghai. Guixiang said she was looking for her husband and told Qi that her mother was living at No. 108 Nanlinli, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei, and that she would visit her from time to time. Qi finished his business in Yuyao and came to Shanghai the day before yesterday. On Sanma Road, he met Ren Fuchun and asked him where his wife was living. Fuchun said that his wife was still in his hometown and had not come to Shanghai. Qi then told Fuchun everything Guixiang had said when they met. The next day, Fuchun and Qi went to his mother-in-law's house in Zhabei to inquire about Guixiang's whereabouts. However, his mother-in-law insisted that she did not know. Later, Fuchun found a letter from Guixiang in his mother-in-law's room, which said that she was living with a Xu in Xiejiao and that everything was going well. Ren was now unemployed and lacked food and clothing, and it was necessary to find a solution. This made Ren very suspicious. It was clear that his mother-in-law was colluding to hide his wife. He then called the police and accused Xie Wu of the Fourth District First Branch. After questioning by Director Yao, since the statements were conflicting, they were prepared to be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning yesterday.</p>
<h3>"Good Things are Often Frustrating," The Police Arrive</h3>
<p>Xu Jinchun and Cheng Hanshi</p>
<p>Xu Jinchun, a 25-year-old coppersmith from Shaoxing, living at No. 52 Shunxingli, Hongzhen, had an affair with Cheng Hanshi, a 19-year-old woman. They were found having an affair in room 20 of the Guang'an Hotel in Huajie on North Zhejiang Road. The director of the Fourth District First Branch came to the hotel to check on the guests and, because Xu and the woman looked suspicious, they were immediately taken to the station. According to Cheng Hanshi, her husband had abandoned her for another woman and she was having a hard time making a living, so she had an affair with Xu Jinchun. Xu Jinchun's statement was evasive. The director of the police station, believing that the case involved adultery and abduction of a married woman, prepared a document to be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning yesterday.</p>
<h3>Bride Disappears, Accuses Neighbor's Daughter</h3>
<p>Accusation Lacks Concrete Evidence</p>
<p>Instructed to Go Out and Look For Her</p>
<p>Jiang Shaochao, a 25-year-old native of Teng County, Shandong, lives at No. 51 Lujiazui, Pudong, and works as a laborer at the British-American Tobacco Factory. His wife, surnamed, is 18 years old and recently married. Suddenly, on the evening of last Saturday, she went out on the pretext of going out and never returned. Jiang searched everywhere, but there was no news. Later, he recalled that on the day his wife ran away, the daughter of his neighbor, Li Anchen, from Anhui, named Chaodi, had whispered to his wife at home, so he suspected her. Therefore, he reported the case to the police yesterday and accused Li Anchen and Chaodi together to the Public Security Bureau's Third District. According to Li Chaodi, she is 18 years old. Last Saturday, she went to visit a newlywed in the neighborhood and saw Jiang's wife. She invited her to go see a show and they had dinner at a Tongzhou woman's house. Because it was already dark, she said she wasn't going back. She was unwilling to stay out, so she asked him to send her home. Jiang's wife then turned back. She didn't know what else happened. The district chief verified the statements and ruled that the accusations made by Jiang lacked concrete evidence and ordered him to go out and look for her and report back to the district.</p>
<h3>Forced Carnal Knowledge of a Young Girl and Trafficking to Shanghai for Sale</h3>
<p>Still Claimed Love Had Developed</p>
<p>And Was Mutually Desired</p>
<p>Xue Qiu Di, the 17-year-old daughter of Xue Hefu, a native of Wuxi living at No. 3 Qianjiatang, Albet Road, French Concession, was raised from a young age at the home of relatives Fan Cao in Suzhou. Zhu Fengsheng, a servant in Cao's family, took advantage of Cao's absence to forcibly defile Qiu Di. Then, last month, he abducted her to Shanghai, intending to sell her. The girl's father, Xue Afu, learned of this and reported it to the French police, who ordered detectives to arrest Zhu Fengsheng and bring him and Qiu Di to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the French court for interrogation. The plaintiff, Xue Afu, complained about the situation of his daughter being defiled and abducted by Zhu and intending to sell her. According to Xue Qiu Di, Zhu Fengsheng forcibly defiled the girl and then forced her to come to Shanghai with him. The girl refused, but Zhu said that if she did not comply, he would set fire to Cao's house. Therefore, the girl was afraid and followed him to Shanghai. Zhu Fengsheng claimed that Qiu Di voluntarily had a love affair with him and that it was mutually desired and that there was no rape. The Chinese and Western officials judged that the defendant, Zhu Fengsheng, should be detained temporarily and a document should be prepared to transfer him to the Wuxian Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Marrying a Concubine for Lack of an Heir</h3>
<p>Endured All Things, Concubine Actually Runs Away</p>
<p>Han Yongru, a 49-year-old native of Jiading, lives at No. 7 Jideli, Bailinan Road, Shanghai West, and runs a bamboo shop at No. 3 Bailinan Road. His wife, Chen, gave birth to a son who was married two years ago. Last spring, she had a grandson. Han was extremely happy and always smiling. Unexpectedly, fate was unpredictable. Last fall, his beloved son and grandson died one after another. Han's grief was beyond description. Because he was over half a hundred years old, he was afraid of having no descendants, and he was even more worried. After persuasion from relatives and friends, he decided to marry a concubine for the sake of continuing his lineage. Last October, through an introduction, he married Zhang Feng's daughter, named Aibao, a 24-year-old woman from Nanxiang living at No. 3 Tonghuili, Xingapore Road. Han spent over one hundred yuan on the marriage. Aibao was beautiful, so she was loved by Han. Because Aibao was still working in the Dongyang silk factory, Han strongly discouraged her from doing so because the customs in the factory were not good. At the end of the year, Aibao obeyed and stopped working. In February of this year, Aibao went to work at the Gongyi Factory again. Han was very unhappy and complained. Since then, Aibao changed greatly, often going out to play and often arguing with Han. Han, because he was eager to have a son, was especially tolerant. Unexpectedly, on the morning of last Saturday, Aibao took the opportunity to grab her clothes, made a large bundle, and fled. Han sent out detectives everywhere, but there was no news. It was later learned from Aibao's mother, Zhang Feng, that Zhu Zhizong, a worker at the Xinxingguan in Wujiaochang, had abducted Aibao and sold her to Xu Rusheng at No. 1531 Shendeli, Dongxi Huade Road. Yesterday, Zhang Feng and Han went together and grabbed Zhu, called the police, and took him back to the Sixth District Police Station. After questioning by Director Ren, since the case involved the abduction of a young woman, he immediately prepared a document and sent it to the Local Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Crane Cable Breaks, Fifty Bags of Flour Crush Laborer to Death</h3>
<p>Wharf owner Yang Zhanggui loaded 1,900 bags of flour from a customs broker at 11:00 AM on the 12th and sailed to the Japanese Daigu Warehouse in Yangshupu, docking outside the Changsha Maru ship. A thick cable was lowered from the ship's crane, and the dockworkers gathered fifty bags of flour into a sling and attached it to the cable to hoist it up. At the same time, the workers continued to prepare the second sling. Unexpectedly, the fifty bags of flour in the first sling fell because the cable was rusted and could not bear the excessive weight. Among them, a dockworker, Wang Caigou (31 years old, native of Chongming), was working below and did not know that disaster was coming. He was unable to escape and was crushed by the fifty bags of flour. When the other workers ran over to move the flour and rescue Caigou, they saw that his left foot had been crushed and his head and neck and back were seriously injured and he was unconscious. The workers then splashed cold water on the injured man's face to gradually wake him up and immediately hired a car to take him to a nearby hospital for treatment. However, the injury had penetrated the bone. Although the doctor performed surgery, it was ineffective. He died in the hospital at 3:00 AM the day before. Wharf owner Yang Zhanggui reported the incident to the Water Patrol Police Station. Yesterday, the body was transported to the Relief Bureau Autopsy Office for examination. It is reported that the family members of the deceased believe that the root cause of the disaster was that the responsible personnel on the ship did not carefully examine the hook and cable, and they are preparing to negotiate with the ship's company for compensation for the loss of life.</p>

<h3>The Wine Lees Seller Was Killed By A Car</h3>
<p>The News Indicates It Was Due To Carelessness</p>
<p>Driver Gao Baoshan, No. 162 of the French Tramway Company, was driving his car to the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Alfread at about 10:00 a.m. on the first day of this month. It happened that Huang Jinfa (55 years old), a native of Nanhui who sold wine lees, was carrying a load of wine lees on his shoulder and walking by the side of the track. Gao was unable to stop in time and knocked Huang down, resulting in his death. The body was reported by the Transportation Department to the French Court. Judge Zhu Chen examined the body and found that there were no relatives present at the time, so he ordered that photos be taken and the body be taken to the court for collection. Now his family has come to Shanghai to identify the body and take it back to his hometown for burial. Yesterday, the police brought the driver, Gao Baoshan, to the French Court for questioning. First, the head of the Transportation Department reported that the case was due to the deceased's own carelessness, resulting in the accident. He requested a review. The defendant, Gao Baoshan, stated that he was driving very slowly that day, and it was because the deceased rushed out from a side road that the collision occurred. He requested the Chinese and Western officials to investigate and judge. After questioning, it was confirmed that the case was indeed due to the deceased's own carelessness and had nothing to do with others. The case was dismissed.</p>
<h3>Tenants of Zhen'an Alley Ordered to Move Out by a Deadline</h3>
<p>The landlord of Zhen'an Alley on Ximen Road in the French Concession, Ji Company, formerly represented by lawyer Fei Xizhen, sued all the tenants in the French Court for occupying the house, delaying the relocation, violating the contract, and requesting forced relocation. The tenants filed a counterclaim against Xingji Company. Yesterday morning, they received another subpoena. First, the tenants' representative lawyer, Da Yaoxian, stated that the house was only six years old and very solid, and there was no need to renovate it. He requested that they be allowed to continue to live there and that Xingji Company restore the original water supply. Fei, the representative of Xingji, said that the property was actually sold to Ji Company by Cao Zhenji, and now there is a deed that can prove it. In March, he applied to the Public Works Bureau for a license to renovate the house. He now presents the drawings for the renovation of the house for inspection. This case has already been debated clearly last time. In short, the tenants have a clause in the lease agreement stating that if the landlord wants to take back the house, he must notify them one month in advance. Now that the time limit has expired, they should be ordered to move out. Judge Tang reviewed the words and inspected the drawings. After the debate between the two parties was over, he wrote and judged: "The landlord notified the tenants to move out one month in advance in order to renovate the house and start construction, and the landlord submitted the documents and drawings approved for the renovation, which is true. Since there is no fixed term in the contract between the two parties, the request to have the tenants move out of the house for construction is not unreasonable. In addition to the rent that should be reduced by the landlord for two months as a subsidy for the tenants' relocation expenses, all the tenants currently living there must move out within one month from the date of the judgment and must not delay."</p>

<p>Thursday (7)</p>
<h3>The Story of World Literature (1) (5) (3) by John Macy, translated by Hu Zhongchi</h3>
<p>Chapter 18: French Poetry of the 19th Century</p>
<p>Sulley Prudhomme's Parnassian objectivity takes the shape of philosophy and science; his "creed" and "happiness" are written as poetic logic and metaphysics. Yet he is not wholly abstract, for he has a soft feeling for human affliction, and though he is far from the joy akin to lyric poetry, he has genuine poetic emotion and an unquestionable skill in diction and form.</p>
<p>After Leconte de Lisle, the most certain of the Parnassians is Heredia, whose volume "Les Trophées" is, in French, or I dare say in any language after Shakespeare, the most astonishing collection of short poems. Heredia's objectivity is historical; he searches the past of mankind for his subject matter. His Parnassian friend Coppée called his poems "legends of the centuries written in short verse." Those poems are beautifully translated into English, yet each line is packed with so much content, so richly lustrous and clear with illusion, that to translate them adequately would await a Rossetti.</p>
<p>A writer of genius who fits into no school but stands singularly alone is Richepin, a man of wavering life and thought, yet of great original power. His first collection of poems, "La Chanson des Gueux," was so audacious that Richepin was imprisoned for violating public morals. Yet he did not cease, and France grew accustomed to him, even to acknowledging his essential honesty, his brave will to struggle with life. Not only that, his work gradually improved; his novels and plays, though fiercely uncompromising, reached psychological insight. He is a recognized classic of the French stage. The Parnassians had not wholly run their course when they were succeeded by the rising school of Symbolists. This word, which we have mentioned at the head of this chapter, is hard to define, yet perhaps not harder than to define poetry itself. What Symbolism is, we may hint by a familiar example: If Poe's raven in the poem is a dark aspect of fate or of his soul, there is a double meaning beneath the surface of the poem, and the poem is symbolic. It is more than a simple metaphor in which one thing represents another; it is a thing which, by an association of ideas, represents the whole idea. Symbolism is as old as poetry itself. French poets created a conscious method of it. Stéphane Mallarmé, a disciple of Baudelaire, pushed it to a point beyond the ordinary sense of failure to express thought. He deliberately suppressed the primary meaning of thought and word, leaving no trace except his own imagination, for the secondary thought and meaning. This is something new and strange in a literature famous for its clarity, and it has bewildered even the admirable French poets and critics. Yet many of Mallarmé's poems are not as clear as the light of day, but lie in a bewitching twilight zone, familiar to readers of English poetry. Mallarmé, like Baudelaire, if he did not regard Poe as a master, regarded him as a kindred artist and made beautiful translations of the American poet.</p>
<p>Mallarmé's mystic voice reached only the ears of a rare few of his countrymen, and is not likely to startle the ears of the world outside of France. Another Symbolist, Paul Verlaine, was famous in his lifetime as one of the great poets of France and modern Europe. Verlaine's poetry is a passionate outpouring of his feelings, loves, hates, hopes, despairs. He paid almost no heed to the rules of French classical poetry, using only the feeling of almost unerring internal melody. In his famous "Art Poétique" he states his principles, which, needless to say, are his own and of little help to other poets. The first principle is that music is above all else. No wit, no invention, no rhetoric. Only music is ever present.</p>
